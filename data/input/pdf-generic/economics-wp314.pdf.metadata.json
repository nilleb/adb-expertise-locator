INTRODUCTION \n \nThe global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 and its aftermath have highlighted the problems that \noccur when corporate entities are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d.1 The potential bankruptcy of some large \nUnited States (US) banks and nonbank financial institutions in September\u2013October 2008 was \nseen by the government as likely to damage the broader economy\u2015consequently, these firms \nwere provided with various forms of support that kept management in place and prevented \ncreditor  losses  (Sorkin  2009).  More  broadly,  as  the crisis  spread  around  the  world,  many \ncountries put in place extraordinary measures to protect their largest financial and nonfinancial \nfirms,  including  banks,  insurance  companies,  and  auto  manufacturers.  Presumably,  these \nefforts further undermine the incentives for careful risk management in the future\u2015managers \nare less likely to be careful if they feel that downside risks (both personal and corporate) will be \ncovered by the state, and outside investors will provide cheaper capital to such large implicitly \nstate-guaranteed firms.2 Governments may now promise not to provide further bailouts, but in \nthe view of Alessandri and Haldane (2009, p.7)\u2015from the Bank of England\u2015such promises are \nunlikely to be believed: \n \n\u201cEx-ante, they [the authorities] may well say \u201cnever again.\u201d But the ex-post costs of crisis \nmean that such a statement lacks credibility. Knowing this, the rational response by market \nparticipants is to double their bets. This adds to the costs of future crises. And the larger these \ncosts, the lower the credibility of \u2018never again\u2019 announcements.\u201d   \n \nIn contrast, the current consensus in the US official circles is that the government can \ncommit not to bail out large firms. For example, Title II of the Dodd\u2013Frank financial legislation \n(signed into law on 21 July 21 2010) creates a \u201cresolution authority\u201d that allows a regulatory \nagency (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) to manage the effective bankruptcy of big \nnonbank financial institutions, i.e., run an orderly process in which creditors and shareholders \nincur  losses  (and  management  can  be  fired)  but,  in  principle,  the  financial  system  is  not \njeopardized and there is no shock to the broader economy.3 If investors view this as credible, \nthey should no longer provide cheap funding for \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial institutions.4   \n \nCan such a \u201cno bailout\u201d government policy constitute a credible commitment that solves \nthe problem of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d? Ex ante promises to let companies fail\u2015and run through some \nform of bankruptcy\u2015may not be optimal when the moment for a decision actually arrives. In \nparticular, given the \u201csystemic\u201d nature of financial crises\u2015with widespread perceived contagion \n                                                 \n1  \u201cToo big to fail\u201d is far from a new issue, as discussed in detail by Stern and Feldman (2004)\u2015in the modern \nAmerican context, it dates from at least the conservatorship of Continental Illinois in the 1980s. Concerns about \nthis issue have become more intense since fall 2008. \n2  The status of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d definitely protects creditors and should enable firms to borrow more cheaply. It may \nor may not also generate higher expected returns for shareholders\u2015on the one hand, the firm is less likely to go \nbankrupt, but on the other hand, share values can still fall to almost zero before some recovery (as was the case \nwith US banks in 2007-\u20132009). \n3  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had such authority before the Dodd\u2013Frank bill, but only over \nbanks with insured deposits\u2015i.e., this did not cover nonbank financial companies and, as interpreted, also was \nnot applied to Bank Holding Companies (typically, large banks with major non-deposit taking activities) in 2008\u2013\n2009.  \n4  This was the claim made by President Barrack Obama when he signed the Dodd\u2013Frank bill into law in July 2010, \n\u201cFinally, because of this law, the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street's \nmistakes. There will be no more taxpayer-funded bailouts. Period. If a large financial institution should ever fail, \nthis reform gives us the ability to wind it down without endangering the broader economy. And there will be new \nrules to make clear that no firm is somehow protected because it is \"too big to fail,\" so that we don't have another \nAIG.\u201d (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/text-of-obama-remarks-on-dodd-frank-2010-07-21)  ", "2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nboth within and across countries \u2013 will financial markets really believe any government when it \npromises not to save its biggest firms? \n \nRelevant experience in the Republic of Korea suggests an answer: No. When financial \ncrisis broke out at the end of 1997, the banking system was threatened with collapse and the \nexchange rate depreciated rapidly. At this time of crisis, government policy was explicitly and \nemphatically not to bailout the largest Korean conglomerates (known as chaebol), which were \nheavily leveraged and exposed to the ensuing financial crisis. This approach was rooted in the \nincoming president\u2019s long-standing dislike for and opposition to the political power of large \nchaebol, and the authorities attempted to make the firmest and most credible commitments in \nthis regard, including through its agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).5   \n \nDespite this, the largest conglomerates (\u201cchaebol\u201d) were able to borrow heavily from \nhouseholds through issuing bonds at low interest rates in 1998\u2015allowing many of them to avoid \nimmediate failure and become even bigger relative to the economy. The largest conglomerates \nissued disproportionately more bonds than other firms and were able to do so at rates implying \nmuch lower default risk. There is no evidence that this advantageous access to finance was due \nto better historic performance, stronger prospects, preferential access to state-owned banks, \nimplicit cross-debt guarantees among group members, less exposure to the financial crisis, or \nbetter governance within the biggest firms\u2015if anything, all objective measures suggest that the \nlargest  conglomerates  were  actually  in  worse  shape  (apart  from  their  presumed  implicit \ngovernment backing) relative to other Korean firms. Instead, the most plausible interpretation is \nthat investors perceived these large firms as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d.  \n \nInvestors\u2019 perceptions proved largely correct. Daewoo, the Republic of Korea\u2019s third \nlargest  conglomerate,  declared  bankruptcy  in  1999,  and  Hyundai,  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s \nlargest conglomerate, also had an actual default in 2000 default in 2000. In both cases, the \ngovernment, fearing another economic crisis, intervened so as to effectively and largely bail out \nthe bond investors.6  \n \nTo assess the extent to which \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs contributed to the flow of bond \nfinance  towards  chaebol-affiliated  firms  in  1998,  we  obtained  comprehensive  data  on  the \namount and date of issuance for every publicly placed corporate bond in the Republic of Korea \nin 1998. The dataset, which covers 1,175 bond issues, also includes the yield to maturity for \neach bond issue at the time of issuance along with the issuing firm\u2019s credit rating at the time. \nUsing  company  names,  we  then  matched  the  issuance-level  data  to  firms\u2019  financial  and \nownership data, as compiled by National Information Credit Evaluation (NICE). One of the \nlargest  Korean  credit  evaluating  firms,  NICE  compiles  and  verifies  firms\u2019  annual  financial \nstatements submitted to the Korea Securities Supervisory Board. In total, the NICE data covers \nabout 9,000 firms during the 1990s. We also use the NICE financial data to track financial flows \nvia loans, bonds, and equity to firms before and after the financial crisis. Finally, we match this \ndata to firms\u2019 chaebol affiliation using data provided by the Korean Fair Trade Commission \n(KFTC). \n \n                                                 \n5  The government\u2019s fiscal position was healthy and there was little outstanding public debt, so bailouts were \nfeasible. But the government, backed by the IMF and the US Treasury, stated there would be no money to protect \ncreditors, and this was enshrined in the country\u2019s Letters of Intent with the IMF in December 1997 (Johnson and \nKwak, 2010, chapter 2; also endnote 17 on p.237). Section I provides more details of this shift in government \npolicy towards bailouts.  \n6  Oh and Rhee (2002) estimate that investors recovered 95% of their initial investment in Daewoo because of these \nemergency measures put in place by the Korean government. See Section I. ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   3 \n \n \nUsing  these  data,  we  confirm  that  the  chaebol-affiliated  firms  did  in  fact  enjoy \ndisproportionate access to bond financing in 1998. Within our panel of firms, the Herfindahl \nindex of total gross funds rose from 0.012 in the early and mid-1990s to 0.019 in 1998, and \n0.016 in 1999. This increased concentration of financial flows was driven by the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s biggest chaebols. Firms affiliated with the top five chaebols received 34% of net finance \nin 1996 and 46% in 1998. Firms affiliated with the largest five chaebols also raised much more \nbond financing than anyone else\u2015firms in the largest five chaebols accounted for 53% of net \nbond flows in 1998, while firms in the next 25 largest chaebols only accounted for 11%.  \n \nHowever, it is harder to establish that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs facilitated the largest \nchaebols access to bonds in 1998. For example, were investors willing to lend to these large \nchaebols because they were better run or had better projects at the time, or was it just that \ninvestors  saw  them  as  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d?  This  is  a  tough  question  because  post-crisis \nperformance  was  likely  affected  by  whether  or  not  a  firm  could  obtain  external  funding. \nMoreover, pre-crisis performance measures are not necessarily informative as a crisis of this \nnature dramatically changes the relative profitability of activities.  \n \nTo control for potential differences in investment opportunities among firms, we employ \ntwo complementary approaches. First, we test for differences in post-crisis access to bond \nfinancing within industries. Using industry fixed effects to control for unobserved differences in \ninvestment opportunities across industries, we test whether a chaebol-affiliated firm enjoyed \nbetter access to capital relative to other firms in the same industry. Second, we exploit an \nestablished  feature  of  emerging  markets  in  general  and  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  in \nparticular\u2015specifically the finding that corporate governance matters for firm-level outcomes. \nThe literature has established that firms with weaker corporate governance had less good \nperformance in the Republic of Korea before the crisis (Joh 2003), as well as more adverse \nstock  price  outcomes  during  the  crisis  (Baek,  Kang,  and  Park  2004).  A  firm\u2019s  pre-crisis \ngovernance thus provides a plausible alternative proxy for a firm\u2019s likely performance and \ndefault risk following the crisis. If the bond market was allocating capital on the basis of likely \nperformance rather than \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs, we would expect that more capital should have \nflowed to firms with better governance (i.e., stronger safeguards against \u201ctunneling\u201d by insiders, \nwhich hurts both outside equity investors and creditors).7  \n \nUsing this strategy, we find evidence consistent with investors believing the largest \nKorean  firms  were  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  in  1998.  Chaebol-affiliated  firms  were  able  to  issue \nsignificantly more bonds and at better rates relative to other firms that issued bonds in the same \nindustry.  These  findings  are  robust  to  controlling  for  numerous  firm-level  characteristics \nmeasured  prior  to  the  crisis.  Moreover,  there  is  no  evidence  to  indicate  that  bond  prices \nincorporated the default risk of firms; investors appeared indifferent to credit ratings or other \nstandard measures of default risk in 1998, and bond prices at the time of issuance yield no \nevidence that investors anticipated the eventual default of some chaebols. For example, firms \naffiliated  with  Daewoo\u2015the  second  largest  chaebol  (by  some  measures)  that  soon \ndefaulted\u2015actually sold bonds in 1998 with a lower interest rate than did other chaebol-affiliated \nfirms. There is also no evidence that the bond market allocated credit to firms with better \ncorporate governance. Instead, the chaebol-affiliated firms receiving the most bond financing in \n1998 (and at the best rates) actually had the worst corporate governance (and the worst implied \ncreditor protection against various forms of tunneling).  \n                                                 \n7  The available governance measures are for shareholder protection. But in an environment of potential pervasive \ntunneling by insiders, protections provided to shareholders can also help creditors\u2014both are helped when it is \nharder for managers effectively to steal value (Johnson et al. 2000). ", "4   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nAlternative explanations cannot easily explain why chaebol-affiliated firms were able to \nsignificantly issue more bonds and at better rates after the crisis. The greater ability to borrow \ndoes not appear driven by implicit cross-debt guarantees among firms within a chaebol. Such \nguarantees were legally prohibited, and our findings hold when we aggregate chaebol-affiliated \nfirms up to the group level and treat an entire chaebol as just one observation. Less exposure to \nthe Korean crisis because of international business or better export opportunities also does not \nappear to explain our findings. Our findings are robust to controlling for firms\u2019 level of exports \nand to using within-industry comparisons. There is also no evidence that in the absence of a \ngovernment bailout, chaebol-affiliated firms were a lower default risk after the crisis. We find that \nthe default rate of chaebol-affiliated firms was actually higher than that of non-chaebol firms. \n \nOverall, this evidence is consistent with Korean investors believing the very largest \nKorean chaebol were \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d in 1998\u2015despite explicit attempts by the government to \nestablish and implement a no bailout policy. When the entire set of firms in a chaebol group \nwere very large relative to the economy or sufficiently important to key components of the \neconomy, it made sense for investors to expect that the government would, one way or another, \neventually and substantially ride to their rescue.8 It is very hard to commit not to save massive \nfirms and their investors\u2015because of the systemic implications, and investors know this.9 Of \ncourse, if investors believe there will be such a rescue, they will reward bigger firms with \ncheaper access to finance, further solidifying these firms\u2019 status as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. The Korean \nevidence suggests that a government commitment\u2015no matter how binding\u2015to not bail out \nlarge firms is unlikely to eliminate \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs because it is not time consistent and, in \na crisis, emergency measures can always be brought in to help investors. \n \nMost of the established literature on the issue of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d has focused on the \nfinancial sector and has been relatively informal\u2015although quite prescient, e.g., Stern and \nFeldman (2004), which anticipated many of the global issues seen in 2008\u20132009. Drawing on \nexperience in the 1990s, Summers (2000) summarizes best practice for policy: \u201cIt is certain that \na healthy financial system cannot be built on the expectation of bailouts.\u201d Our paper expands \nthe set of retrospective experiences when \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d was a relevant consideration to \nnonfinancial conglomerates, which can also pose a systematic risk when they account for a \nsignificant share of the domestic economy. The case of the Republic of Korea strongly suggests \nthat the more general study of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d should not be limited to the financial sector alone. \n \nOur evidence fits well with the idea that vested interests play an important role in \nfinancial development (Morck, Wolfenzon, and Yeung 2005) and suggests links between \u201ctoo \nbig to fail\u201d and the broader evidence that firm-level governance and financing arrangements \nmatter for country-level macroeconomic outcomes. The link seems to be particularly strong for \ncrises in emerging markets where firms with weaker corporate governance are more likely to \nsuffer stock price declines when a crisis hits (Johnson et al. 2000, Mitton 2002, Lemmon and \nLins 2003).10 \n \nOur analysis of the Republic of Korea's bond market also relates to growing evidence \nregarding the importance of legal institutions for financial development (Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, \n                                                 \n8  Additionally, part of this \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d belief may be driven by the largest chaebols being household brand names \nin the Republic of Korea (e.g., Samsung, Daewoo, Hyundai, LG, and SK), which would only bolster the belief of \ninvestors and households that these firms would never be allowed to fail. \n9  This idea is similar to that of Bhattacharya (2003), which derives a model where agents rationally participate in \ngigantic Ponzi schemes because they correctly believe that a partial bailout is possible when the scheme \neventually collapses.  \n10  This literature builds directly on the measurement of investor protection in La Portaet al. (1997 and 1998). ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   5 \n \n \nand Levine 2003) and how market-based or bank-based financial systems may independently \nmatter for economic development and growth (Beck and Levine 2002). Our paper builds upon \nexisting work concerning business groups in the Republic of Korea (Bae, Kang, and Kim 2002), \nthe separation of ownership and control frequently found in these firms (Claessens, Djankov, \nand Lang 2000), and the readjustment of credit extended to these groups following the financial \ncrisis (Borensztein and Lee 2002).  \n \nThe remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section I explains the nature of the \nRepublic of Korea's financial system through the mid-1990s. Section II explains our empirical \nspecification, and Section III describes the data. Section IV reports our regressions. Section V \noffers some additional analysis of loans and profitability, and Section VI concludes.  \n \n \nII. REPUBLIC OF KOREA\u2019S CHAEBOLS AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM \n \nIn this section, we briefly describe the size of the Republic of Korea\u2019s largest chaebols in \nrelation to the economy prior to the financial crisis in 1997\u20131998, and also the development of \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s financial market during the crises years. We place particular emphasis \non the development of the country\u2019s corporate bond market, which provided a primary channel \nthrough which firms, particularly the largest chaebols, raised capital following the crisis in 1998. \n \nA.  Republic of Korea\u2019s Chaebols and Financial Markets, Pre-1998 \n \nChaebols\u2015groups of firms in the Republic of Korea connected through complicated ownership \nstructures\u2015dominate the Korean economy. There were hundreds of such chaebols prior to the \nfinancial  crisis  in  1997,  but  the  largest  five  and  next  largest  25  chaebols  were  generally \nconsidered to be in a class of their own in terms of size. The five largest chaebols prior to the \ncrises, in terms of total assets, were Hyundai, Samsung, LG, Daewoo, and SK. These five \nchaebols alone had combined sales of 225 trillion won (W) in 1996. These sales are significant \nrelative to the size of the Republic of Korea\u2019s entire gross domestic product (GDP) at the time, \nW448.6 trillion. The next largest 25 chaebols also accounted for a significant share of sales in \n1996. Total sales of these 25 chaebols were W86 trillion in 1996.11 The market share of these \nchaebols, particularly the largest five, facilitated what many considered to be a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \nbelief by investors (Krueger and Yoo 2002). \n \nThe  chaebols\u2019  enormous  size  is  partially  attributed  to  their  success  as  exporters, \ncombined with subsidized credit from the government, during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. \nFrom the 1960s into the 1980s, the Republic of Korea\u2019s financial system, which was dominated \nby state-owned banks, allocated credit at the behest of the government. These directed bank \ncredits were provided to firms that fulfilled government priorities, particularly through developing \nexports. Korean chaebols were adept beneficiaries of this system, allowing them to capture a \nsignificant share of the economy.12  \n \nIn the early 1990s, there were attempts by the government to switch towards a more \nmarket-based financial system, but almost all external financing for firms continued to flow \nthrough banks. Official aggregate flows of funds data from the Bank of Korea demonstrate this. \nBefore 1997, total annual net financial flows to the corporate sector were around 25% of GDP, \n                                                 \n11  We calculate the sales of the largest chaebols using our NICE data, which is described in Section II. The gross \ndomestic product is provided by the Bank of Korea and given in Appendix Table II. \n12  See Krueger and Yoo (2002) for more details on the history and growth of chaebols. ", "6   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nof  which  financial  intermediaries  provided  between  45%  and  60%.13 The  largest  chaebols \naccounted for a significant share of these bank loans. About 44% of net finance flows from \nfinancial intermediaries in 1996 went to the largest five chaebols in 1996. Other important \nsources of funds before the crisis were commercial paper (17.5% of all funding in 1996), stocks \n(10.9%), and overseas borrowing (10.4%).  \n \nDespite its large nominal size, the corporate bond market was quite inactive prior to the \ncrisis. Corporate bonds issued prior to 1998 were essentially disguised bank loans rather than \ncapital market instruments as Korean banks routinely guaranteed corporate bonds and held \nthem to the maturity. Bond investment by banks was an alternative method to extend loans to a \nspecific company when banks could not extend loans to the company due to loan exposure \nregulation.  By  investing  in  bonds,  banks  could  escape  the  regulation  which  limited  loan \nexposure per firm as bond holdings were classified as portfolio investments, not loans. The \ngovernment's regulation on interest rates also hampered the development of corporate bond \nmarkets. Instead of putting a ceiling on interest rates, the government took an indirect approach. \nIt controlled the supply of corporate bonds (new issuance of corporate bonds had to be pre-\napproved) to manage market interest rates.  \n \nB.  Chaebols, the Post-Crisis Bond Market, and Bailouts \n \nFollowing the financial crisis in 1997, the Republic of Korea\u2019s financial markets, which had \nhistorically favored the largest chaebols, changed dramatically. In response to the crisis, the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s banks dramatically curtailed their lending. Net financial flows from the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  intermediaries  were  a  negative  W15.9  trillion  in  1998,  indicating  net \nrepayment of loans. Because of their high leverage, this drop in bank loans, a primary source of \ncapital for the largest chaebols, likely posed a significant challenge for chaebol-affiliated firms. \nThe median debt-to-equity ratio of firms affiliated with a top five chaebol was 3.9 in 1997, and \nthe median debt-to-equity ratio of firms affiliated with the next largest 25 chaebols was 3.6. \nFirms affiliated with Hyundai had a median debt-to-equity ratio of 5.1 in 1997. \n \nAt the same time, government policy towards propping up failing banks and firms also \nchanged. The  Republic of Korea government, backed by the IMF and the US Treasury, stated \nthere would be no money to protect individual firms, and this was enshrined in the country\u2019s \nLetter of Intent with the IMF at the very end of 1997.14 These shifts were intended to signal that \nno firm was \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and that government aid would not be forthcoming for troubled firms. \nThese  shifts  were  substantiated  by  the  government\u2019s  willingness  to  allow  some  smaller \nchaebols to go bankrupt. Hanil, the 27th largest chaebol in 1997, entered bankruptcy in the \nsecond half of 1998. New Core and Geopyung, ranked 27th and 28th in size in 1998, also \nsubsequently went bankrupt. \n \nDespite their high leverage and a supposed unwillingness of the government to bailout \nfailing firms, the chaebol-affiliated firms obtained new financing in 1998 rather easily. This was \n                                                 \n13  For example, in 1996 total financing to the corporate sector was W118,769 billion. Of this, 14% came from bank \nlending directly and 17.5% came from banks through their purchases of bonds. A further 13.9% came from non-\nbank financial intermediaries. See Appendix Table II for the complete aggregate finance data from 1990\u20132002. \n14  From the December 3, 1997, letter (http://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/120397.HTM): paragraph 35, \u201cTo strengthen \nmarket discipline, bankruptcy provisions according to Korean law will be allowed to operate without government \ninterference.  No  government  subsidized  support  or  tax  privileges  will  be  provided  to  bail  out  individual \ncorporations\u201d; paragraph 17, \u201cAll support to financial institutions, other than Bank of Korea liquidity credits, will be \nrecorded transparently in the fiscal accounts\u201d; and the tight fiscal policy laid out in paragraphs 13 and 14. These \ncommitments were reinforced in a second Letter of Intent on 24 December 1997. ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   7 \n \n \naccomplished by their ability to raise significant amounts of capital through bond issues as part \nof an overall surge in the Republic of Korea\u2019s bond market at the time. The monthly average \namount of corporate bonds issued was less than W3 trillion prior to the crisis. But, the monthly \naverage increased to W7 trillion in the second half of 1998, and for all of 1998, the Bank of \nKorea reports net bond financing was W45.9 trillion.15 Moreover, the net finance flows from \nbonds in 1998 roughly equaled the net flows of financial intermediaries before the crisis. Net \nbond flows were 9.5% of GDP in 1998, whereas net flows of indirect finance (i.e., banks) were \nabout 9% of GDP from 1990\u20131997. The dramatic switch from bank-based finance to issuing \nbonds is shown in Figure 1, which shows the main net financial flows to the Korean corporate \nsector during the 1990s as reported by the Bank of Korea.16 \n \n \nFigure 1: Aggregate Net Financial Flows by Year (won billion) \n \n120,000\n105,000\n90,000\n75,000\nn\no 60,000\nW\nn  45,000\no\nBilli 30,000\n15,000\n0\n\u221215,000\n\u221230,000\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000\nBonds Equity Financial Intermediaries  \nNote: This figure reports the aggregate corporate net financial flows for equity, bonds, and loans, by year. \nSource: Bank of Korea. \n \n \nWhile the government\u2019s decision to no longer control the supply of corporate bonds was \na  contributing  factor  in  the  bond  market\u2019s  sudden  development,  the  primary  driver  was  a \ndrawing  down  of  bank  deposits  by  households  and  the  reinvestment  of  these  savings  in \ncorporate  bonds.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  households  moved  their  savings  to \ncorporate bonds for two main reasons.17 First, individuals perceived bonds issued by chaebol-\naffiliated firms to be safe investments irrespective of government commitments to not bail out \nthese  firms.  Second,  banks\u2015many  of  which  were  recently  taken  over  by  the  government \nbecause of the crisis\u2015could not compete with the higher interest rates offered by corporate \nbonds. In January 1998, the three-year bank deposit rate was 17% whereas the three-year \ncorporate bond yield (AA rating) was 24%. The introduction of asset-backed securities and the \nsecuritization of bad bank loans also helped diversify the products available to investors and \ndeepen their demand for bonds in 1998.  \n                                                 \n15  Using an average exchange rate of W1,400 per dollar in 1998, this is about $32.8 billion. \n16  The type of corporate bond issued also changed drastically with the crisis as guaranteed corporate bonds \nimmediately disappeared from the market. Due to new restrictions put in place by the government after the crisis, \nbanks and other institutional investors\u2019 ability to provide a financial guarantee to bond issuers was severely \ncurtailed, and almost all corporate bonds issued after the crisis were non-guaranteed bonds.  \n17  This anecdotal evidence is based on discussions with leading Korean bond experts. Detailed data on household \nsavings and the purchasers of corporate bonds in the Republic of Korea is not available. ", "8   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nThe dramatic growth of the bond market slowed after the government placed a limit on \nthe amount of bonds that chaebol-affiliated firms could issue on 28 October 1998. This limit was \nimplemented out of concerns that the largest chaebols were accumulating large amounts of \ndebt that they would not be able to repay. These concerns were justified in July 1999 when the \nDaewoo group, the third largest chaebol in the Republic of Korea at the time and one of the \nlargest issuers of bonds in 1998, declared bankruptcy.  \n \nImmediately after the Daewoo bankruptcy, the amount of corporate bonds issued was \nalmost negligible, as investors became very sensitive to corporate credit risk and the possibility \nthat the largest chaebols might not be \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. The average monthly issuance of bonds \nfor the first half of 1999 was W2.9 trillion, and the total amount of bonds issued in July and \nAugust 1999 was W2.4 trillion and W2.5 trillion, respectively. In September 1999, however, \ncorporate bonds issued fell to W162 billion, and only averaged W680 billion for the remainder of \n1999. Total monthly bonds issued did not again exceed W2 trillion until February 2001.  \n \nDespite  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  not  bail  out  firms,  lenders  to  the  largest \nchaebols were eventually protected against losses to a large degree in 1999 and 2000 by \ngovernment action. After Daewoo\u2019s bankruptcy, the Korea Asset Management Company, set up \nwith public funds, purchased Daewoo\u2019s non-performing loans and debts, which were estimated \nat more than $57 billion. Oh and Rhee (2002) estimate that investors made back 95% of their \ninitial  investment  in  Daewoo  because  of  these  emergency  measures  put  in  place  by  the \ngovernment. Hyundai, another large issuer of debt in 1998 also had an actual default in 2000. \nUnable to rollover its debt, the company was only able to avoid bankruptcy through government \nmeasures initiated to avoid another collapse similar to Daewoo. Through these measures, the \nKorean Development Bank purchased bonds from Hyundai and other troubled companies, thus \nshielding bond investors from potential losses.18 \n \nWhy were chaebol-affiliated firms able to issue so many bonds after the crisis and after \nthe  government  stated  there  would  be  no  money  to  protect  individual  firms?  Were  these \nfinancial flows to the largest firms because these firms were better run or had better projects at \nthe time, or was it just that investors still saw them as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d? To address this question, \nwe now turn to our empirical specification.  \n \n \nIII. EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION \n \nTo analyze whether \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d perceptions among bond investors may have contributed to \nchaebol-affiliated firms\u2019 ability to access bonds in 1998, we need to test whether chaebol \naffiliation is associated with better access to bond financing after controlling for firms\u2019 investment \nopportunities and underlying default risk. For example, one relationship of interest is: \n \nF \uf03d\uf061\uf02b\uf062\uf0d7P \uf02b\uf047\uf0d7Chaebol \uf02b\uf065 (1) \ni,j,T i,j,T i i,j,T  \n \nwhere F  is a measure of the finance obtained by firm i in industry j and period T, i.e., after the \ni,j,T\ncrisis, P  is a measure of the expected return on the firm's projects in T (and beyond), and \ni,j,T\nChaebol  is an indicator for being affiliated with a large chaebol. We are interested in whether \ni\n                                                 \n18  See Oh and Rhee (2002) for more details of these emergency measures. ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   9 \n \n \n\uf047\uf03e0, which would suggest better access to capital for chaebol-affiliated firms after controlling \nfor investment opportunities. Likewise, another relationship of interest is: \n \nYTM \uf03d\uf061\uf02b\uf062\uf0d7Risk \uf02b\uf047\uf0d7Chaebol \uf02b\uf065   (2) \ni,j,T i,j,T i i,j,T\n \nWhere, YTM  is a measure of the yield-to-maturity offered on bond issues of firm i in industry \ni,j,T\nj after the crisis, and Risk  is a measure of the underlying default risk (absent a government \ni,j,T\nbailout) on the bonds issued by firm i. Now, we are interested in whether \uf047\uf03c0, which would \nsuggest investors perceived chaebol-affiliated firms as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. The problem is that we \ndo not have a good measure of either expected return, P, or default risk, Risk.  \n \nUsing post-crisis performance measures to proxy for P is not appealing as these are \nlikely affected in part by access to finance, causing a potential endogeneity bias. Firms with \naccess to the bond market following the crisis may have performed better simply because they \ncould obtain credit when other firms could not. For example, Daewoo, which issued a large \nshare of the bonds in 1998, was probably able to delay bankruptcy because of its ability to issue \nbonds. Therefore, using post-crisis performance measures would bias us towards finding a \npositive correlation between performance and financial access. A similar concern arises in trying \nto determine whether these bond issues adequately priced a firm\u2019s default risk, Risk. \n \nUsing other standard proxies for investment opportunities, such as Tobin\u2019s Q, from \nbefore the crisis to proxy for firms\u2019 expected return on investments after the crisis is also not \nappealing. A dramatic change in relative prices following the crisis likely shifted the set of \nprofitable investments to new areas of the economy, and a firm\u2019s performance prior to the crisis \nneed not be a strong predictor of its post-crisis expected returns. Using standard measures of \ndefault risk measured from before the onset of the crisis is also unappealing for the same \nreason.  \n \nTo capture differences in investment opportunities and risk across firms, we instead rely \non industry fixed effects. Adding industry fixed effects to the above specifications will help \ncontrol for unobserved investment opportunities and risk attributes at the industry level and \nensure that we are only estimating differences in post-crisis access to bond financing within \nindustries\u2015i.e., are chaebol-affiliated firms able to borrow more and at better terms than other \nfirms in the same industry? \n \nAn additional and attractive proxy for the potential risk and return of a firm\u2019s investments \nfollowing  the  crisis  is  a  firm\u2019s  corporate  governance  structure  prior  to  the  crisis.  Recent \ncorporate governance literature suggests that corporate governance arrangements matter for \nfirm-level performance (Mitton 2002; Lemmon and Lins 2003; Morck, Wolfenzon, and Yeung \n2005),  and  there  is  ample  evidence  that  corporate  governance  mattered  for  performance \nspecifically in the Republic of Korea before, during, and after the crisis (Joh 2003; Baek, Kang, \nand Park 2004; Black, Jang, and Kim 2006). Governance structures also tend to be persistent, \nand in the Republic of Korea, they do not appear affected by the financial crisis. Thus, as an \nadditional control for investment opportunities, we will also test the robustness of our findings to \nincluding controls for firm-level governance. \n \nMaking use of these ideas, we estimate the following specification: \n \nF \uf03d\uf061\uf02b\uf06c \uf02b\uf062\uf0d7G \uf02b\uf047\uf0d7Chaebol \uf02bZ' \uf0d7\uf067\uf02b\uf065   (3) \ni,j,T j i,j,T\uf02ds i i,j,T\uf02ds i,j,T", "10   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nwhere F  is the finance obtained by firm i in industry j and period T, which is after the crisis; \ni,j,T\n\uf06care three-digit industry fixed effects, and G is the corporate governance of firm i in period \nj i,j,T\uf02ds\nT-s,  which  is  before  the  crisis;  and  Z' is  a  vector  of  firm-level  controls,  which  are  all \ni,T\uf02ds\nmeasured before the crisis to ensure they are not endogenously related to post-crisis financial \nflows. We estimate a similar regression for the yield-to-maturity of bonds issued in 1998. \n \nOur main empirical specifications will rely on industry fixed effects to capture differences \nin  investment  opportunities  and  risk.  Empirical  specifications  that  also  include  corporate \ngovernance as an additional proxy will rely on three assumptions. First, the crisis was a surprise \nto all concerned, so that corporate governance and other arrangements were not designed with \nthe crisis in mind. Second, corporate governance is to some extent persistent, i.e., cannot be \nquickly changed, particularly during a crisis.19 Third, building on Joh\u2019s (2003) result that firms \nwith bad governance performed worse before the crisis, we assume it would be reasonable to \nsuppose that in early 1998 these same firms would not make good use of external funds.  \n \n \nIV. DATA DESCRIPTION \n \nIn this section, we describe the construction of variables we will use in our subsequent analysis. \nA more detailed description of how we construct each variable can be found in Appendix Table \n1. Descriptive statistics of our key variables and controls are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and \npair-wise  correlations  of  key  variables  are  reported  in  Table  3.  As  noted  in  our  empirical \nstrategy, all firm-level controls, including those for chaebol membership, corporate governance, \nand size are measured prior to the financial crisis to ensure they are not endogenously related \nto post-crisis bond flows and yield to maturity, which form our main dependent variables. To that \neffect,  we  construct  all  of  our  firm-level  controls  from  1996  data  to  ensure  they  are  not \ninfluenced by financial crisis in mid- to late-1997. All subsequent analysis is also robust to \nconstructing our control variables from 1997 data instead.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n19 The corporate governance measures used in our later specifications are in fact highly persistent.

Chaebol Membership \n \nA firm\u2019s chaebol affiliation is determined using the KFTC annual publication of the 30 largest \nchaebols, according to total assets. This is the standard measure used both in the literature and \nby practitioners in the Republic of Korea. In our subsequent analysis, a firm is classified as \nchaebol-affiliated based on the 1996 listing of the top 30 chaebols. According to the KFTC, \nthere are 343 firms affiliated with a top-30 chaebol in 1996. Because there is a large distinction \nbetween the largest five chaebols (Hyundai, Samsung, LG, Daewoo, and SK) and the next \nlargest 25 chaebols, in terms of overall size, we also separately identify firms affiliated with a top \nfive chaebols and those that are affiliated with the next 25 largest chaebols.  \n \nThere was some merger activity during the period of interest, and it is not clear how \nexactly to treat a firm that joins or leaves a chaebol. In our base regressions and descriptive \nstatistics, we therefore drop all firms that become a member of a top-30 chaebol during 1997\u2013\n2000 or leave a chaebol during 1997\u20131998. However, in our robustness checks, we add these \nfirms to the sample and confirm that our results are robust to treating these firms as either non-\nchaebol or chaebol and clustering the standard errors on either pre- or post-crisis chaebol \naffiliation.  \nIn our base regressions, we cluster the standard errors by chaebol to avoid overstating \nthe findings, which might occur if financing decisions or idiosyncratic shocks occur at the group \nlevel rather than among individual firms. Our results are robust to not clustering.  \n \n   ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   13 \n \n \nB.   Financial Flows and Firm Characteristics \n \nOur measures of firm-level financial flows, i.e., bonds, loans, and equity, are derived from \noperating activity cash flow data reported in a dataset compiled by the NICE. One of the largest \ncredit evaluating firms in the Republic of Korea, NICE compiles and verifies firms\u2019 annual \nfinancial  statements  submitted  to  the  Korea  Securities  Supervisory  Board.  After  excluding \nobservations  on  financial  firms,  the  NICE  data  set  contains  the  financial  statements  for \napproximately 6,400 nonfinancial firms in 1996 and 8,800 firms by 2000.  \n \nThe NICE financial dataset captures a large share of the Republic of Korea\u2019s economy, \nand the aggregate pattern of financial flows for firms in the dataset closely mirror those of the \nentire economy. This is shown in Figure 2, where we calculate the aggregate net equity, bond, \nand financial intermediary flows by year using NICE. The overall amount and changes in net \nfinancial flows reported by NICE are very similar to those reported by the Bank of Korea, as \nreported in Figure 1.20 Net financing from loans is almost zero in 1998, while financing from \nbond issues provides the primary source of capital in 1998. Equity-financing is relatively small, \nexcept in 1999. \n \n \nFigure 2: Aggregate Net Financial Flows, as Reported by NICE (billion won) \n \n120,000\n105,000\n90,000\n75,000\nn\no 60,000\nW\nn  45,000\no\nBilli 30,000\n15,000\n0\n\u221215,000\n\u221230,000\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000\nBonds Equity Financial Intermediaries plus Commercial Paper  \n \nNICE = National Information Credit Evaluation. \nNote: This figure reports the aggregate corporate net financial flows for equity, bonds, and loans, by year as calculated from the \nNICE dataset. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n \n \nThe chaebol-affiliated firms, particularly those in a top five chaebol, appear to issue a \ndisproportionate share of the bonds in the post-crisis years. This is seen in Table 1, where we \nreport the number of firms that report positive cash inflows from bond issuances and the \naverage gross bond flows normalized by assets for firms from 1996\u20132000. Between 500 and \n600 firms issue bonds each year in the 3 years following the crisis, but about 20% of the issuers \n                                                 \n20  Note that the Bank of Korea construction of net bond flows used in Figure 1 does not include bonds issued \noverseas with foreign currency denomination, while our measurement of bond flows from the NICE data does \ninclude such bonds. Moreover, we cannot separate out commercial paper from our loans in the NICE data. \nDespite these differences in how the two datasets are constructed, the two series show the same general pattern.

The chaebol-affiliated firms also issue far more bonds per unit of assets \nthan non-chaebol firms. The average gross bond flows normalized by assets is around one from \n1997\u20132000 for all firms, and for chaebol-affiliated firms, it is four times larger.  \n \nIn 1998, the concentration of bond flows among the largest five chaebols is even starker. \nAverage gross bond flows normalized by assets is 10.9 for firms affiliated with the five largest \nchaebols, compared to just 0.93 for all firms. In fact, the 54 firms associated with the top five \nchaebols\u2015and actively issuing bonds in 1998\u2015accounted for 56% of the gross bond flows, \nthough they only account for 10% of the firms that issue bonds in 1998. And the 59 firms \nassociated with the next 25 largest chaebols and actively issuing bonds in 1998 accounted for \n13% of gross bond flows in 1998.21  \n \nThe number of firms with cash inflows from loans or equity in 1998 is larger, but the net \nfinancial flows from loans and equity are much smaller than that of bond flows. As seen in \nTable 1, approximately 5,000 firms have positive net financial flows from loans in 1998. But, as \nshown in Figures 1 and 2, the net financial flows from the loan market were negative in 1998. \nLikewise, while around 1,000 firms issued equity in 1998, the aggregate volume of net equity \nfinancing did not become sizable until 1999. On aggregate, the bond market provided the \nprimary source of capital in the year immediately following the financial crisis. \n \nThe NICE dataset also provides us a number of other key firm-level characteristics, \nincluding firm size and leverage, which will be used as controls in our regressions. The log of \ntotal assets is used to control for overall firm size since larger firms naturally borrow more in \nlevels. Findings are also robust to using second-, third-, and fourth-order polynomials of total \nassets to control for size or to controlling for size non-parametrically using fixed effects based \non which decile a firm\u2019s assets belong to . A firm\u2019s leverage ratio, as measured by total debt \ndivided by assets controls for a firm\u2019s level of indebtedness and exposure to risk. We also \ncontrol for the amount of cash flows generated by the firm. To do this, we calculate a firm\u2019s cash \nflows normalized by assets, where cash flows are measured using operating cash flows plus \ndepreciation and minus changes in accruals. To control for the volatility of a firm\u2019s cash flow, we \nalso calculate a firm\u2019s cash volatility, which is the standard deviation of cash flows/assets from \n1994\u20131996. Finally, to capture other potential risk exposures beyond leverage, we calculate the \nfirms\u2019 modified Altman Z-score.22 \n \nAs  expected,  chaebol-affiliated  firms  are  much  larger  and  less  profitable  than  non-\nchaebol firms prior to the crisis. This is seen in Table 2, which provides descriptive statistics for \nboth the entire sample of firms in NICE and those that issue bonds in 1998. Firms affiliated with \na top-5 chaebol are 3.1 log points larger in total assets than non-chaebol firms, and nearly a log \npoint larger than firms affiliated with the 25 largest chaebols. Overall, firms affiliated with a top \n30 chaebol account for approximately 40% of total assets and 50% of total sales in 1996. \nConfirming that the top five are much larger than even the next 25 largest chaebols and more \nlikely to be considered \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, they alone account for 25% of assets and 36% of sales. \nAt the same time, however, firms affiliated with a top 30 chaebol are less profitable than non-\n                                                 \n21  Total gross bond flows in 1998 for firms in the NICE data were W71.9 trillion, of which firms in top five chaebols \naccounted for W40.2 trillion, and firms in next 25 largest chaebols accounted for W9.1 trillion. \n22  Following  MacKie-Mason  (1990),  we  calculate  a  modified-Altman  Z-score  as  3.3*(EBIT/assets)  + \n1.0*(sales/assets) + 1.4*(retained earnings/assets) + 1.2*(working capital/assets). Since we do not have stock \nprice data, we are unable to calculate firms\u2019 ratio of market equity to book debt, and instead control for book \nleverage separately.

This is also true among the \nsubset of firms that successfully issue bonds in 1998. \n \nC.   Corporate Governance \n \nTo construct our pre-crisis measures of corporate governance\u2014which again will serve as one \nproxy for firms\u2019 ability to invest funds successfully after the financial crisis (and the likelihood \nthat  such  returns  would  benefit  outside  equity  holders  and  creditors)\u2014we  use  the  NICE \nownership data. This dataset lists the eight largest shareholders and their ownership stake for a \nsubset of the firms found in the larger financial dataset provided by NICE. Ownership data is \navailable for approximately 3,500 firms in 1996.23 We use two variables to measure corporate \ngovernance: control-ownership rights gap and ownership concentration. Both of these variables \nwere used by Joh (2003) and are derived using ownership data provided by NICE.  \n \nTo construct these two corporate governance measures, we first calculate the ownership \n(cash flow) and control rights of the controlling family in each firm. Since the controlling family or \nfounders of the firm are typically the largest shareholder, we calculate the ownership rights of \nthe controlling family by summing up all personal holdings among the largest eight shareholders \nreported by NICE. Thus, all institutional shareholders (financial institutions and nonfinancial \ncorporations), foreign owners, government, and employee stock ownership are excluded. It is \nnecessary to sum overall personal shareholdings since some shares are often controlled by \nspouses or family members of the spouse, and it is not possible to distinguish such family \nconnections in the Republic of Korea as wives do not adopt their husband's last name. The \ncontrol rights of these shareholders are then approximated using the total sum of ownership \nstakes for all eight of the largest shareholders, including the non-personal holdings excluded \nfrom  the  measure  of  ownership  rights.  The  implicit  assumption  is  that  these  non-personal \nshareholdings among the largest shareholders are companies which are indirectly controlled by \nthe founding family of the firm, which is typically the case in the Republic of Korea.24 \n \nOur first measure of corporate governance is the control-ownership rights gap, which is \ncalculated by taking the difference between the control and ownership rights. This measure \ncaptures the degree to which ownership and control rights are aligned within each firm. Firms \nwith a greater spread between the control and ownership stakes of the top shareholders are \nmore susceptible to poor management and misaligned incentives\u2015definitely not in the interest \nof outside equity holders and creditors. Therefore, a larger control-ownership gap represents \nweaker  corporate  governance  and  should  be  negatively  related  to  firm  performance  and \npositively related to default risk. In fact, this negative correlation with firm performance has been \ndocumented in a number of papers that analyze firms in the Republic of Korea (Joh 2003; \nLemmon and Lins 2003; Baek, Kang, and Park 2004), and is also present in our dataset. As \nseen in Table 3, where we report correlations between our key variables, the control-ownership \nrights gap is negatively correlated to ROA in 1996.  \n \nOur second measure of corporate governance will be the ownership concentration of the \nfirm, which is measured using the ownership (cash flow) rights of the controlling family. The \ninability of some institutional or smaller shareholders to exercise voting rights under regulations \nof the Republic of Korea often allows a large shareholder to maintain control with a very small \nownership  stake.  Controlling  shareholders  with  a  larger  ownership  stake  likely  face  better \n                                                 \n23  The pattern of total finance flows exhibited in the economy-wide data (Figure 1) and full sample of firms (Figure 2) \nalso persists in the more restricted sample of firms with ownership data.  \n24  See Joh (2003) for more details on constructing the both measures of corporate governance. ", "16   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nincentives, and thus, greater ownership concentration represents a firm with better corporate \ngovernance and should be positively related to firm performance\u2015and to the prospect that bond \nholders will be repaid. Again, a number of papers have shown this positive correlation between \nownership concentration and firm performance to be true in the Republic of Korea (Joh 2003; \nMitton 2002; Baek, Kang, and Park 2004), and we find it in our dataset as well. This is shown in \nTable 3.  \n \nThe summary statistics also support the anecdotal evidence that chaebol-affiliated firms \nexhibit very weak corporate governance structures. As seen in Table 2, chaebol-affiliated firms \nhave a much larger control-ownership gap and lower ownership concentration than non-chaebol \nfirms. The control-ownership rights gap is more than twice as large for chaebol-affiliated firms in \nboth the full sample of firms and in the smaller sample of firms that issue bonds in 1998. And, \nownership concentration of chaebol-affiliated firms averages only 7%\u201310% compared to 48% \nfor non-chaebol firms in the full sample and 32% in the sample of non-chaebol firms that issue \nbonds in 1998.  \n \nAs required for our empirical strategy, the corporate governance measures are also \nhighly persistent over time for firms. From 1993\u20131997, both measures exhibit serial correlation \ncoefficients  of  about  0.93.  Additionally,  as  is  shown  in  later  analysis,  both  measures  are \ncorrelated with firm performance following the financial crisis. This supports our assumption that \nthese measures provide valid proxies for firms\u2019 ability to invest funds successfully after the \nfinancial crisis. \n \n \nV. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION \n \nA.   Access to Bonds in 1998 \n \nFirms  affiliated  with  the  largest  chaebols  received  a  disproportionate  amount  of  the  bond \nfinancing in 1998. This is seen in Table 4, column (i), where we regress the log of gross bond \nflows in 1998 onto pre-crisis measures of firm\u2019s chaebol affiliation, industry fixed effects, and \nother firm-level controls for size and leverage. The top five chaebol dummy is positive and \nhighly significant. Being a member of a top five chaebol is associated with a 1.2 log point \nincrease in gross bond flows for a firm in 1998 relative to other firms in the same industry that \nalso issue bonds in that year. This effect is large. One log point in the gross bond flows \nregression is about half a standard deviation in our sample, and the average log of gross bond \nflows in 1998 for all firms in the Republic of Korea is 16.2. The dummy for being a chaebol in the \ntop 30 (but not the top five) is also significant, though the magnitude of the effect is about one-\nthird of that observed for the largest five chaebols.25 As expected, size is a strong positive \npredictor of gross bond flows and leverage is a negative predictor.  \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n25  The smaller coefficient for the next largest 25 chaebols likely reflects that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs were less for \nthese firms. As noted earlier, these next 25 largest chaebols were considerably smaller than the top five chaebols, \nand the government tried to establish a no bailout policy by allowing Hanil, the 27th largest chaebol in 1997, to \nenter bankruptcy in the second half of 1998.

Using corporate governance structures prior to the \ncrisis as another proxy for firms\u2019 post-crisis ability to implement projects successfully after the \ncrisis, we still find a very strong relationship between chaebol-affiliation and gross bond flows. \nAdding our control for ownership concentration in column (ii) of Table 4, we do not find any \ncorrelation between ownership concentration and bond flows in 1998. But, we do find a negative \nrelationship between control-ownership rights gap and bond flows [column (iii)], which weakly \nsuggests that firms with worse governance issued fewer bonds. Both the top five chaebol and \ntop 6\u201330 chaebol indicators, however, remain positive and highly significant predictors of bond \nflows after the crisis.  \n \nThe disproportionate access to bonds for firms affiliated with the largest chaebols also \nstrongly suggests that these financial flows were not related to firms\u2019 presumed ability to invest \nthe funds successfully. As shown earlier, chaebol-affiliated firms typically had the weakest \ncorporate governance structures and overall profitability prior to the crisis. As a robustness ", "18   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \ncheck, we also confirm that firms\u2019 pre-crisis profitability is also not positively related to post-crisis \nbond flows.  \n \nOther firm-level differences in risk exposure or access to cash do not seem to explain \nthe preferential access to bond financing for chaebol-affiliated firms. In column (iv) of Table 4, \nwe instead use pre-crisis controls for cash flows, volatility of cash flows, and bankruptcy risk, as \nmeasured by the modified Altman z-score. Again, both chaebol indicators remain a strong \npositive predictor of bond flows. In unreported regressions, the results are also robust to adding \ncontrols for exports/sales and foreign currency borrowings/total liabilities, which suggest that \nchaebols\u2019 ability to issue bonds is not driven by better export opportunities or better access to \ninternational capital markets. We also found that the results are robust to adding controls for \ncash/assets,  R&D  expenses,  market  share,  and  training  expenditures.  And,  as  mentioned \nearlier, all findings are robust to alternative forms of clustering the standard errors. \n \nOne possibility is that chaebol-affiliation simply proxies for overall size. As seen in Table \n2, chaebol-affiliated firms are much larger than the average firm. Since larger firms are likely to \nissue more bonds, one must worry that our control of size, log(total assets), is insufficient to \ncapture the importance of size. However, the results for chaebol-affiliation in Table 4 are robust \nto adding nonlinear size controls to the estimation such as second-, third-, and fourth-order \npolynomial controls for total assets. The findings are also robust to restricting our sample to only \nthe 500 largest firms, based on total assets in 1996, and re-estimating the equation.26 And, the \nresults are robust to non-parametrically controlling for the size of assets by including fixed \neffects based on which decile a firm\u2019s assets belong to in 1996. \n \nAnother possibility, however, may be that investors perceive chaebol-affiliated firms to \npossess a larger asset base to collateralize the bonds issued by the firm. In particular, chaebol-\naffiliated  firms  may  benefit  from  cross-debt  guarantees  from  their  affiliated  firms,  leading \ninvestors to view the bonds as potentially backed by the entire group\u2019s asset base, rather than \njust the firm\u2019s individual assets. If this were true, then controlling for an individual firm\u2019s assets \nalone will not be sufficient. Additionally, it is possible that investors perceive chaebol-affiliated \nfirms to be safer investments because an entire chaebols\u2019 operations will be more diversified \nthan that of any single firm, providing another implicit benefit of any cross-debt guarantees or \ncross-subsidization within the chaebol. If this is true, then controlling for an individual firm\u2019s \nriskiness (such as cash flow volatility or the modified Altman Z-Score) will not adequately \ncapture investors\u2019 perception of risk for a chaebol-affiliated firm. \n \n   \n                                                 \n26  These estimates are reported in Appendix Table III. Our findings are also robust to using net bond finance flows \nnormalized by total assets as the dependent variable instead of Log(gross bond flows). These estimates are \nreported in Appendix Table 4. ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   19 \n \n \nHowever,  new  cross-debt  guarantees  were  not  allowed  in  the  crisis,  i.e.,  existing \narrangements stayed in place, but any new debt issue (e.g., in the form of bonds) was not \nallowed to be cross-guaranteed within a chaebol (or in any other way). This was a condition of \nthe IMF loan that helped stabilize the macroeconomy, and it was viewed as an important \nelement of the overall economic policy both by the government and by the US Treasury. There \nwas  rigorous  enforcement  for  the  letter  of  this  rule,  which  pertained  to  explicit  cross-debt \nguarantees.27 Implicit cross-guarantees, which might occur through tunneling of cash among \ngroup members, is also unlikely to explain our findings since the companies issuing bonds were \noften the largest in the chaebol making it unlikely that the other group members had sufficiently \ndeep pockets to bail them out.28 \n \nTo further exclude the possibility of implicit cross-debt guarantees driving our results, we \nre-estimate our main regression after aggregating chaebol-affiliated firms up to the group level \nand treating an entire chaebol as just one observation. In particular, we calculate total assets, \ngross bond flows, and our other controls for cash flows and bankruptcy risk at the group level. \nFor our corporate governance measures, we use the average ownership concentration and \ncontrol-ownership  rights  gap  of  the  group  members  as  the  proxy  for  the  entire  group.  In \nunreported results, we also tried using the maximum and minimum levels of governance within \nthe group, and the subsequent results were unchanged. Because it is not possible to classify a \ngroups\u2019  industry,  we  do  not  include  industry\u2013year  fixed  effects.  The  estimates  from  these \naggregated regressions are reported in Table 5. \n \nThe disproportionate access of chaebol-affiliated firms does not appear driven by implicit \ncross-debt guarantees. As seen in Table 5, column (i), the five largest chaebols still receive a \nmuch larger share of bond financing in 1998 at the group level. The estimates suggest that a top \nfive  chaebol  group  received  about  1.6  log  point  larger  flow  of  bonds  in  1998,  even  after \ncontrolling for the entire group\u2019s level of assets and overall leverage ratio. There is also still a \nlarge, positive relation between bond financing and affiliation with a top 6\u201330 chaebol, though it \nis no longer always statistically significant at conventional levels. Again, we find no relation \nbetween corporate governance and bond financing in 1998 [columns (ii)\u2013(iii)]. Controlling for the \noverall cash flows, cash volatility, and modified Altman Z-score of the group [column (iv)] also \ndoes not affect the large, positive relation between bond financing and the chaebol indicators.29 \nIn unreported regressions, the results are also robust to adding controls for exports/sales, \nforeign currency borrowings/total liabilities, cash/assets, research and development expenses, \nand market share. \n \n   \n                                                 \n27  See  paragraph  37  in  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  3  December  1997  Letter  of  Intent  to  the  IMF: \n(http://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/120397.htm). In the official IMF summary of the program, the ban on new cross-\nguarantees  (referred  to  as  phasing  out)  is  in  the  third  bullet  point  (see \nhttp://www.imf.org/External/np/exr/facts/asia.pdf). We have checked that this formal language matched the reality \non the ground through interviews with the Republic of Korea government officials and IMF officials, as well as with \npeople active in the Korean bond market. \n28  The subsequent failure and government bailout of Daewoo in 1999 confirms that other group members did not \nhave the ability to tunnel sufficient resources to avoid another group member\u2019s default. \n29  The  chaebols\u2019  ownership  of  some  key  investment  trust  companies  (ITCs)  also  does  not  explain  their \ndisproportionate access to bonds. ITCs were used by many individuals and institutional investors to purchase \nbonds in 1998 and chaebols\u2019 ownership may have influenced the portfolio choices of these ITCs. However, fund \nmanagers in these ITCs faced institutional limits on buying bonds of their affiliates, and ITCs unaffiliated with \nchaebols also heavily invested in bonds issued by the chaebols.

The results are robust to industry fixed effects and numerous controls \nfor the overall size of these firms and the possibility that investors may have perceived the \nexistence  of  cross-debt  guarantees  among  firms  within  a  chaebol.  Moreover,  there  is  no \nevidence that bond were related to our alternative measure of firm performance, corporate \ngovernance from prior to the crisis. The primary beneficiaries of bonds, firms affiliated with the \nlargest  five  chaebols,  on  average,  had  very  poor  corporate  governance  structures.  This \nevidence appears to run counter to the notion that bond investors sought out firms best able to \ninvest funds. Instead, it suggests that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs may have affected investors\u2019 \nwillingness to buy massive amounts of bonds from firms affiliated with chaebols.  \n \n   ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   21 \n \n \nB.   Yield to Maturity and Default Risk \n \nIt is possible, however, that the poor corporate governance and default risk of firms issuing \nbonds was instead accounted for in the return (yield to maturity [YTM]) of the bonds being \nissued. To test this, we obtained data on the YTM for every publicly placed corporate bond in \nthe Republic of Korea along with the amount and issue date of each bond issuance. In total, \nthere were 1,175 public bond issues in 1998. Using company names, we match the issuance-\nlevel data to a firm\u2019s financial and chaebol-affiliation data used in the previous regressions. After \ndoing this and excluding financial firms, we were left with data on 737 bond issues in 1998.  \n \nUsing a similar specification as before, we regress a bond\u2019s YTM at time of issuance in \n1998 on industry-fixed effects and firm-level characteristics measured using pre-crisis (1996) \ndata. We are interested in seeing whether pre-crisis corporate governance or chaebol-affiliation \nwas priced by investors purchasing bonds in 1998. This would indicate that the disproportionate \namount of bonds issued by the chaebol-affiliated firms and other firms with the poor corporate \ngovernance were at least priced appropriately. To capture any aggregate monthly trend in \ninterest rates throughout 1998, we also include monthly time dummies in the regression.

On  average,  top  five  chaebol-affiliated  bonds  were  issued  at  a  YTM  about  1.7 \npercentage points less than other firms in the same industry [Table 6, column (i)]. The negative \ncorrelation between YTM and top five chaebol affiliation holds even after controlling for firm size \nand leverage [column (ii)]. In unreported regressions, we also find the negative correlation is \nrobust to controlling for firm\u2019s potential exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, as captured by \nexports/sales and foreign currency borrowings/total liabilities. This negative correlation indicates \nthat investors did not perceive the bonds issued by firms affiliated with the top five chaebols to \nbe risky investments. There is less evidence, however, that firms in a 25 next largest chaebols \nissued bonds at lower YTMs on average than non-chaebol firms.  \n \nThe lower YTM on the bond issues of chaebol-affiliated firms is robust to including our \nalternative proxy for default risk\u2015a firm\u2019s pre-crisis corporate governance. Neither measure of \ncorporate  governance  is  significantly  related  to  YTM  in  1998,  suggesting  that  corporate \ngovernance was not priced by investors, and a top five chaebol affiliation is still strongly and \nnegatively related to YTM [Table 6, columns (iii)\u2013(iv)]. Moreover, the fact that top five chaebol-\naffiliated firms were able to issue bonds at a lower YTM than the average firm, despite chaebol-\naffiliated firms typically had the worst governance and profitability prior to the crisis, further \nsuggests that investors willingness to hold these bonds was not related to firms\u2019 ability to invest \nthe funds successfully.  \n \nChaebol-affiliated firms\u2019 ability to issue bonds at a lower YTM also does not appear to be \nrelated to the amount or maturity of the bonds being issued by these firms. There was very little \nvariation in the maturity of the bonds in 1998; about two-thirds of the bonds were issued with a \nstandard three-year maturity, and nearly all of the rest had a one- or two-year maturity. And \nadding controls for the size of issue also does not affect our findings [Table 7, column (i)].  \n \nOne possibility, however, is that chaebol-affiliated firms were less likely to default for \nother reasons not captured by size, leverage, or greater ability to invest funds successfully (as \nmeasured by industry fixed effects and pre-crisis corporate governance), issuance size, or \nmaturity. To test for this possibility, we next added a control for a firms\u2019 overall credit rating at \nthe time of the bond issuance.  \n \n   ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   23 \n \n \n \nTable 7: Bond YTMs and Default Risk \n \nDependent Variable =  YTM of Bond Issue \n  (i) (ii) (iii)\nTop 5 Chaebol  \u20132.066***  \u20131.858*  \u20132.059*** \n   (0.575)  (1.077)  (0.575) \nTop 6\u201330 Chaebol  1.027  1.14  1.039 \n   (0.838)  (0.955)  (0.831) \nLog(Total Assets)  0.224  0.879**  0.22 \n   (0.270)  (0.347)  (0.266) \nDebt / Assets  2.784*  1.895  2.738* \n   (1.640)  (2.771)  (1.608) \nLog(Amount Issued)  \u20130.129  \u20130.337  \u20130.135 \n   (0.347)  (0.309)  (0.357) \nCredit Rating     \u20130.107    \n      (0.126)    \nEventual Default        0.188 \n         (0.580) \n  \nIndustry Fixed Effects  Yes  Yes  Yes \nTime (Month) Dummies  Yes  Yes  Yes \nObservations  737  506  737 \nR-squared  0.41  0.55  0.41 \n* = 10% level, ** = 5% level, *** = 1% level, OLS = ordinary least squares, YTM = yield to maturity. \nNotes: \n1.

Bankruptcy equals 1, if a firm declared bankruptcy between 1999\u20132001. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n \n \nTo control for credit ratings, we obtained the history of credit ratings reported by three of \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s largest credit rating agencies: NICE, Korea Investors Service, and \nKorea Ratings Corporation. Following the financial crises, each firm making a public issue of \nbonds was required to obtain a credit rating from two credit agencies. We then match these \ncredit ratings to the bond issuance data using company names and transform each rating into a \nnumerical value. For example, an AAA credit rating is assigned a score of 26, whereas a credit \nscore of AAA\u2013 is assigned a score of 25, and so on. If the two agencies reporting a credit rating \nfor the firm differ in their rating, we take the average of the two ratings. Of the 737 bond issues \nthat we have YTM and firm-level data, we are able to match credit ratings for 506 of the bond \nissues.  \n \nSurprisingly, there is no evidence to indicate that a bond\u2019s YTM was related to a firm\u2019s \ncredit  rating  [Table  7,  column  (ii)].  While  the  coefficient  is  negative,  the  estimate  is  not \nstatistically significant. Chaebol affiliation remains a strong, negative predictor of YTM. This \nindicates that chaebol-affiliated firms\u2019 lower YTM is not driven by a better credit rating and that \nchaebol-affiliated firms were able to issue bonds at a lower YTM relative to firms of similar \nindustry, size, leverage, and credit rating. ", "24   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nThe lack of significant, negative correlation between YTM and credit ratings may be \nexplained by the relative newness of the bond market or \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d belief on behalf of the \nindividuals constructing these ratings. Credit agencies may simply have been ill-equipped to \nassess accurately firms\u2019 likelihood of defaulting on their bonds, and investors were correct to \nignore these credit ratings. There is evidence to suggest this may have been the case. In 1998, \nthere is actually a positive, statistically significant correlation between credit ratings and whether \nthe bond eventually defaulted. In other words, bonds issued in 1998 that eventually defaulted \nwere given a better credit rating on average.  \n \nIndividual investors, however, do not seem to have been any better at predicting default \nfor bonds issued in 1998. If we instead proxy for a bonds\u2019 risk using ex-post data on which firms \nactually declared bankruptcy between 1999\u20132001, we find no significant correlation between \neventual default and YTM at time of issue in 1998 [Table 7, column (iii)]. In fact, in a simple \nregression of YTM onto an indicator for eventual default and monthly dummies in 1998, we find \nthat YTM and eventual default were negatively related. While the estimate is not statistically \nsignificant  at  conventional  levels  (t-stat  =  1.5),  it  certainly  is  not  consistent  with  investors \naccurately pricing default risk in 1998. \n \nThere is also no evidence that chaebol-affiliated firms, without a government bailout, \nwere less likely to eventually default on their bonds. In a regression of an indicator for eventual \ndefault onto our indicators for chaebol affiliation\u2014monthly dummies and industry dummies\u2014we \nfind that bonds issued by firms affiliated with a chaebol were actually more likely to experience \nan eventual default. While the estimate is not statistically significant at conventional levels (t-stat \n=1.2),  bonds  issued  by  top  five  chaebol  firms  were  8.5  percentage  points  more  likely  to \nexperience default. Bonds issued by the next largest 25 chaebols were 1.2 percentage points \nmore likely to experience default, but again the estimate is not statistically significant (t-stat = \n0.44). \n \nThese findings are striking as they are the opposite of what one would expect to find in a \nwell-functioning bond market. Not only were the largest finance flows being directed towards \nfirms with the worst corporate governance, it would appear investors perceived these to be safe \ninvestments\u2015bonds issued by chaebol-affiliated firms sold at a premium relative to other bonds. \nIn  fact,  chaebol-affiliated  firms  that  did  eventually  default,  such  as  Daewoo  and  Hyundai, \nactually sold debt at a greater premium (lower interest rate) than bonds issued by firms affiliated \nwith other chaebols, and investors appeared indifferent to credit ratings. Overall, the pricing \nevidence  is  consistent  with  households  ex  ante  regarding  these  corporate  bonds  as  safe \ninvestments and the large chaebol-affiliated firms as \u201ctoo large to fail\u201d in 1998.  \n \n \nVI. LOANS AND PROFITABILITY \n \nA.   Pre-crisis Loans and Chaebol Affiliation \n \nSo far, the evidence suggests that the bond market disproportionately favored chaebol-affiliated \nfirms, and this preferential access appears consistent with a \u201ctoo large to fail\u201d perception on \nbehalf of Korean investors. However, it is unclear whether this preferential access to bonds was \nuniquely different from pre-crisis financial flows.  \n \nTo determine whether chaebol-affiliated firms\u2019 preferential access to bonds in 1998 was \ndifferent  than  pre-crisis  financial  flows,  we  look  at the  relation  between  chaebol  affiliation, \ncorporate  governance,  and  lending  in  1996.  Prior  to  the  crisis,  loans  from  financial ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   25 \n \n \nintermediaries were the primary means to raise capital in the Republic of Korea. Looking at loan \nflows in 1996, before the onset of the financial crisis, allows us to see whether chaebol-affiliated \nfirms also enjoyed preferential access to capital prior to the crisis. In particular, we now use log \nof gross loan flows before the crisis in 1996 as the dependent variable, and our control variables \nare constructed using data from 1995. These estimates are reported in Table 8.  \n \nFirms affiliated with the largest chaebols did not appear to receive a disproportionate \nshare of the loan financing prior to the crisis relative to other firms in the same industry. The top \nfive chaebol dummies are mostly negative in Table 8, and not statistically significant from zero. \nThere is only weak evidence that firms affiliated with the next largest 25 chaebols received a \nlarger amount of loans relative to other firms in the same industry.

This is striking given our earlier estimates \nindicate that these firms with greater ownership concentration were no more likely to issue \nbonds in 1998. In unreported results, we also found a negative correlation between our second \ngovernance measure, the control-ownership rights gap, and ROA in 1998 as we might expect, \nthough the estimate is not significant at conventional levels. In further support that firms with \nbetter pre-crisis corporate governance are more likely to make effective use of financing in the \npost-crisis years, ownership concentration remains a strong, positive predictor of ROA in 1999 \nand 2000 as well. \n \nThe top five chaebol dummy is also positively related to ROA in 1998, but it is important \nto emphasize that this need not imply that the chaebol-affiliated firms were better able to invest \nfunds after the crises than other firms. As noted earlier in the discussion of our empirical \nstrategy, post-crisis performance measures after the crisis are likely affected by access to ", "  Ending \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   27 \n \n \nfinance. Firms with access to the bond market following the crisis may have performed better \nsimply  because  they  could  obtain  credit  when  other  firms  could  not.  In  fact,  the  strong \nperformance of firms affiliated with the top five chaebols in 1998 likely reflects their preferential \naccess to bonds in that, ex-post, we know that these firms were actually more likely to go \nbankrupt in later years. Additionally, we can see that affiliation with a top five chaebol is not \npositively related to ROA in 1999 or 2000. This again highlights the importance of our empirical \nstrategy to use industry fixed effects and pre-crisis measures of corporate governance to proxy \nfor firms\u2019 post-crisis ability to invest funds successfully. \n \n \nVII. CONCLUSION \n \nOur evidence suggests that households in the Repulic of Korea were willing to forgo demand \ndeposits and buy corporate bonds during the Korean banking crisis of 1997\u20131998 because they \nregarded the largest chaebols as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. There is no evidence that the bond market \nallocated credit to firms more likely to make better use of the funds, and there is also no \nevidence  that  default  risk  was  appropriately  priced.  Chaebol-affiliated  firms  issued  larger \namounts of bonds relative to other firms in the same industry. Moreover, the large chaebol-\naffiliated firms receiving the most bond financing in 1998 actually had the worst corporate \ngovernance prior to crisis and the highest eventual default rates, indicating they would be least \nable to invest the funds successfully. These chaebol-affiliated firms were also able to issue \nbonds with a lower yield-to-maturity relative to that of other firms, and there is no evidence that \ncorporate governance or other standard measures of default risk were priced by bond investors. \nIn fact, firms affiliated with Daewoo, a huge chaebol that did eventually default, actually sold \nbonds in 1998 at a higher premium (i.e., lower interest rate) than firms affiliated with other \nchaebols.  \n \nThese \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs persisted despite serious efforts of the Government of the \nRepublic of Korea to credibly commit to not bailing out these firms. In retrospect, the market \nbeliefs  were  correct.  When  some  of  the  largest  chaebols  were  unable  to  meet  their  debt \nobligations in 1999 and 2000, the government undertook a large-scale intervention to protect \ncreditors from losses\u2015taking the view that this was necessary in order to prevent another \nfinancial crisis. As a result, the bond investors that had invested in these chaebols largely \nrecouped their investments. The Korean experience suggests that governments may have great \ndifficulty convincing investors that no firm is \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, and that heavy regulation or the \ndismantling of these firms may be necessary. It also strongly suggests that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \nproblems are not necessarily limited to the financial firms. \n \nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s experience also highlights the ability of large, vested interests to \ncontinue their expansion even in the face of a crisis. Funding after the Korean financial crisis \nwas more concentrated than before the crisis, despite the fact that the crisis was due in part to \nlarge chaebol firms over-expanding based on cheap credit. Smaller firms, even those with better \ncorporate governance structures, were unable to access the new capital markets when banks \nstopped lending. The net effect of the crisis, therefore, was to help large firms relative to small \nfirms.  Economic  power  became  even  more  concentrated  as  a  result,  further  perpetuating \ninvestors\u2019 beliefs that the large firms were \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. Rather than breaking the power of \nchaebols, the immediate effect of the crisis\u2015at least in terms of financial flows\u2015was to help \nfurther the strongest pre-crisis special interests. \n   ", "28   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nAppendix Table 1: Definition and Source of Variables \n \nFinancial Flow Variables \n \nGross Bond Flows  Constructed using the 'cash flows from financing activities' \nsection of the NICE financial data set.

The \nevidence suggests that government promises did not eliminate the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs. \nSubsequent government handling of potential and actual defaults by Daewoo and Hyundai \nconfirmed the market view that creditors would be protected.\nADB Economics  \nAbout the Asian Development Bank Working Paper Series\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite \nthe region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion \npeople who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. \nADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration. \n  Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its \nmain instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nEnding \u201cToo Big To Fail\u201d:\nGovernment Promises versus Investor\nTodd A.
