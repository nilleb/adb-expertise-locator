Subsequent  government  handling  of \npotential and actual defaults by Daewoo and Hyundai confirmed the market view \nthat creditors would be protected.  \n \n\nthe  crisis, \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nThe  global  financial  crisis  of  2008\u20132009  and  its  aftermath  have  highlighted  the  problems  that \noccur  when  corporate  entities  are  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d.1 The  potential  bankruptcy  of  some  large \nUnited  States  (US)  banks  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  in  September\u2013October  2008  was \nseen by the government as likely to damage the broader economy\u2015consequently, these firms \nwere  provided  with  various  forms  of  support  that  kept  management  in  place  and  prevented \ncreditor  losses  (Sorkin  2009).  More  broadly,  as  the  crisis  spread  around  the  world,  many \ncountries put in place extraordinary measures to protect their largest financial and nonfinancial \nfirms,  including  banks,  insurance  companies,  and  auto  manufacturers.  Presumably,  these \nefforts  further  undermine  the  incentives  for  careful  risk  management  in  the  future\u2015managers \nare less likely to be careful if they feel that downside risks (both personal and corporate) will be \ncovered by the state, and outside investors will provide cheaper capital to such large implicitly \nstate-guaranteed  firms.2 Governments  may  now  promise  not  to  provide  further  bailouts,  but  in \nthe view of Alessandri and Haldane (2009, p.7)\u2015from the Bank of England\u2015such promises are \nunlikely to be believed: \n \n\n\u201cEx-ante, they [the authorities] may well say \u201cnever again.\u201d But the ex-post costs of crisis \nmean  that  such  a  statement  lacks  credibility.  Knowing  this,  the  rational  response  by  market \nparticipants is to double their bets. This adds to the costs of future crises. And the larger these \ncosts, the lower the credibility of \u2018never again\u2019 announcements.\u201d   \n\n \nIn  contrast,  the  current  consensus  in  the  US  official  circles  is  that  the  government  can \ncommit not to bail out large firms. For example, Title II of the Dodd\u2013Frank financial legislation \n(signed  into  law  on  21  July  21  2010)  creates  a  \u201cresolution  authority\u201d  that  allows  a  regulatory \nagency (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) to manage the effective bankruptcy of big \nnonbank  financial  institutions,  i.e.,  run  an  orderly  process  in  which  creditors  and  shareholders \nincur  losses  (and  management  can  be  fired)  but,  in  principle,  the  financial  system  is  not \njeopardized  and  there  is  no  shock  to  the  broader  economy.3 If  investors  view  this  as  credible, \nthey should no longer provide cheap funding for \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial institutions.4   \n\n \nCan such a \u201cno bailout\u201d government policy constitute a credible commitment that solves \nthe problem of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d? Ex ante promises to let companies fail\u2015and run through some \nform  of  bankruptcy\u2015may  not  be  optimal  when  the  moment  for  a  decision  actually  arrives.  In \nparticular, given the \u201csystemic\u201d nature of financial crises\u2015with widespread perceived contagion \n\n                                                 \n1 \n\n\u201cToo  big  to  fail\u201d  is  far  from  a  new  issue,  as  discussed  in  detail  by  Stern  and  Feldman  (2004)\u2015in  the  modern \nAmerican context, it dates from at least the conservatorship of Continental Illinois in the 1980s. Concerns about \nthis issue have become more intense since fall 2008. \n\n2  The status of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d definitely protects creditors and should enable firms to borrow more cheaply. It may \nor may not also generate higher expected returns for shareholders\u2015on the one hand, the firm is less likely to go \nbankrupt, but on the other hand, share values can still fall to almost zero before some recovery (as was the case \nwith US banks in 2007-\u20132009). \n\n3  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had such authority before the Dodd\u2013Frank bill, but only over \nbanks  with  insured  deposits\u2015i.e.,  this  did  not  cover  nonbank  financial  companies  and,  as  interpreted,  also  was \nnot applied to Bank Holding Companies (typically, large banks with major non-deposit taking activities) in 2008\u2013\n2009.  \n\n4  This was the claim made by President Barrack Obama when he signed the Dodd\u2013Frank bill into law in July 2010, \n\u201cFinally,  because  of  this  law,  the  American  people  will  never  again  be  asked  to  foot  the  bill  for  Wall  Street's \nmistakes. There  will be no more taxpayer-funded bailouts. Period. If a large financial  institution should  ever fail, \nthis reform gives us the ability to wind it down without endangering the broader economy. And there will be new \nrules to make clear that no firm is somehow protected because it is \"too big to fail,\" so that we don't have another \nAIG.\u201d (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/text-of-obama-remarks-on-dodd-frank-2010-07-21)  \n\n\f2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nboth within and across countries \u2013 will financial markets really believe any government when it \npromises not to save its biggest firms? \n\n \nRelevant experience in the Republic of Korea suggests an answer: No. When financial \ncrisis broke out at the end of 1997, the banking system was threatened with collapse and the \nexchange  rate  depreciated  rapidly.  At  this  time  of  crisis,  government  policy  was  explicitly  and \nemphatically not to bailout the largest Korean conglomerates (known as chaebol), which were \nheavily leveraged and exposed to the ensuing financial crisis. This approach was rooted in the \nincoming  president\u2019s  long-standing  dislike  for  and  opposition  to  the  political  power  of  large \nchaebol, and the authorities attempted to make  the firmest and most credible commitments in \nthis regard, including through its agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).5   \n\n \nDespite  this,  the  largest  conglomerates  (\u201cchaebol\u201d)  were  able  to  borrow  heavily  from \nhouseholds through issuing bonds at low interest rates in 1998\u2015allowing many of them to avoid \nimmediate failure and become even bigger relative to the economy. The largest conglomerates \nissued disproportionately more bonds than other firms and were able to do so at rates implying \nmuch lower default risk. There is no evidence that this advantageous access to finance was due \nto  better  historic  performance,  stronger  prospects,  preferential  access  to  state-owned  banks, \nimplicit cross-debt guarantees among group members, less exposure to the financial crisis, or \nbetter governance within the biggest firms\u2015if anything, all objective measures suggest that the \nlargest  conglomerates  were  actually  in  worse  shape  (apart  from  their  presumed  implicit \ngovernment backing) relative to other Korean firms. Instead, the most plausible interpretation is \nthat investors perceived these large firms as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d.  \n\n \nInvestors\u2019  perceptions  proved  largely  correct.  Daewoo,  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  third \nlargest  conglomerate,  declared  bankruptcy  in  1999,  and  Hyundai,  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s \nlargest  conglomerate,  also  had  an  actual  default  in  2000  default  in  2000.  In  both  cases,  the \ngovernment, fearing another economic crisis, intervened so as to effectively and largely bail out \nthe bond investors.6  \n\n \nTo  assess  the  extent  to  which  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  beliefs  contributed  to  the  flow  of  bond \nfinance  towards  chaebol-affiliated  firms  in  1998,  we  obtained  comprehensive  data  on  the \namount and date of issuance for every publicly placed corporate bond in the Republic of Korea \nin  1998.  The  dataset,  which  covers  1,175  bond  issues,  also  includes  the  yield  to  maturity  for \neach  bond  issue  at  the time  of  issuance  along with  the  issuing  firm\u2019s  credit  rating at  the  time. \nUsing  company  names,  we  then  matched  the  issuance-level  data  to  firms\u2019  financial  and \nownership  data,  as  compiled  by  National  Information  Credit  Evaluation  (NICE).  One  of  the \nlargest  Korean  credit  evaluating  firms,  NICE  compiles  and  verifies  firms\u2019  annual  financial \nstatements submitted to the Korea Securities Supervisory Board. In total, the NICE data covers \nabout 9,000 firms during the 1990s. We also use the NICE financial data to track financial flows \nvia loans, bonds, and equity to firms before and after the financial crisis. Finally, we match this \ndata  to  firms\u2019  chaebol  affiliation  using  data  provided  by  the  Korean  Fair  Trade  Commission \n(KFTC). \n \n\n                                                 \n5  The  government\u2019s  fiscal  position  was  healthy  and  there  was  little  outstanding  public  debt,  so  bailouts  were \nfeasible. But the government, backed by the IMF and the US Treasury, stated there would be no money to protect \ncreditors, and this was enshrined in the country\u2019s Letters of Intent with the IMF in December 1997 (Johnson and \nKwak,  2010,  chapter  2;  also  endnote  17  on  p.237).  Section  I  provides  more  details  of  this  shift  in  government \npolicy towards bailouts.  \n\n6  Oh and Rhee (2002) estimate that investors recovered 95% of their initial investment in Daewoo because of these \n\nemergency measures put in place by the Korean government. See Section I. \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   3 \n\n \n \n\nUsing  these  data,  we  confirm  that  the  chaebol-affiliated  firms  did  in  fact  enjoy \ndisproportionate  access  to  bond  financing  in  1998.  Within  our  panel  of  firms,  the  Herfindahl \nindex  of  total  gross  funds  rose  from  0.012  in  the  early  and  mid-1990s  to  0.019  in  1998,  and \n0.016  in  1999.  This  increased  concentration  of  financial  flows  was  driven  by  the  Republic  of \nKorea\u2019s biggest chaebols. Firms affiliated with the top five chaebols received 34% of net finance \nin 1996 and 46% in 1998. Firms affiliated with the largest five chaebols also raised much more \nbond  financing  than  anyone  else\u2015firms  in  the  largest  five  chaebols  accounted  for  53%  of  net \nbond flows in 1998, while firms in the next 25 largest chaebols only accounted for 11%.  \n\n \nHowever,  it  is  harder  to  establish  that  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  beliefs  facilitated  the  largest \nchaebols  access  to  bonds  in  1998.  For  example,  were  investors  willing  to  lend  to  these  large \nchaebols  because  they  were  better  run  or  had  better  projects  at  the  time,  or  was  it  just  that \ninvestors  saw  them  as  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d?  This  is  a  tough  question  because  post-crisis \nperformance  was  likely  affected  by  whether  or  not  a  firm  could  obtain  external  funding. \nMoreover,  pre-crisis  performance  measures  are  not  necessarily  informative  as  a  crisis  of  this \nnature dramatically changes the relative profitability of activities.  \n\n \nTo control for potential differences in investment opportunities among firms, we employ \ntwo  complementary  approaches.  First,  we  test  for  differences  in  post-crisis  access  to  bond \nfinancing within industries. Using industry fixed effects to control for unobserved differences in \ninvestment  opportunities  across  industries,  we  test  whether  a  chaebol-affiliated  firm  enjoyed \nbetter  access  to  capital  relative  to  other  firms  in  the  same  industry.  Second,  we  exploit  an \nestablished  feature  of  emerging  markets  in  general  and  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  in \nparticular\u2015specifically  the  finding  that  corporate  governance  matters  for  firm-level  outcomes. \nThe  literature  has  established  that  firms  with  weaker  corporate  governance  had  less  good \nperformance  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  before  the  crisis  (Joh  2003),  as  well  as  more  adverse \nstock  price  outcomes  during  the  crisis  (Baek,  Kang,  and  Park  2004).  A  firm\u2019s  pre-crisis \ngovernance  thus  provides  a  plausible  alternative  proxy  for  a  firm\u2019s  likely  performance  and \ndefault  risk following  the  crisis.  If  the  bond  market  was  allocating  capital  on  the  basis  of  likely \nperformance rather than \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs, we would expect that more capital should have \nflowed to firms with better governance (i.e., stronger safeguards against \u201ctunneling\u201d by insiders, \nwhich hurts both outside equity investors and creditors).7  \n\n \nUsing  this  strategy,  we  find  evidence  consistent  with  investors  believing  the  largest \nKorean  firms  were  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  in  1998.  Chaebol-affiliated  firms  were  able  to  issue \nsignificantly more bonds and at better rates relative to other firms that issued bonds in the same \nindustry.  These  findings  are  robust  to  controlling  for  numerous  firm-level  characteristics \nmeasured  prior  to  the  crisis.  Moreover,  there  is  no  evidence  to  indicate  that  bond  prices \nincorporated  the  default  risk  of  firms;  investors  appeared  indifferent  to  credit  ratings  or  other \nstandard  measures  of  default  risk  in  1998,  and  bond  prices  at  the  time  of  issuance  yield  no \nevidence  that  investors  anticipated  the  eventual  default  of  some  chaebols.  For  example,  firms \naffiliated  with  Daewoo\u2015the  second \nthat  soon \ndefaulted\u2015actually sold bonds in 1998 with a lower interest rate than did other chaebol-affiliated \nfirms.  There  is  also  no  evidence  that  the  bond  market  allocated  credit  to  firms  with  better \ncorporate governance. Instead, the chaebol-affiliated firms receiving the most bond financing in \n1998 (and at the best rates) actually had the worst corporate governance (and the worst implied \ncreditor protection against various forms of tunneling).  \n\nlargest  chaebol  (by  some  measures) \n\n                                                 \n7  The available governance measures are for shareholder protection. But in an environment of potential pervasive \ntunneling  by  insiders,  protections  provided  to  shareholders  can  also  help  creditors\u2014both  are  helped  when  it  is \nharder for managers effectively to steal value (Johnson et al. 2000). \n\n\f4   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \n\nAlternative  explanations  cannot  easily  explain why  chaebol-affiliated  firms  were  able  to \nsignificantly issue more bonds and at better rates after the crisis. The greater ability to borrow \ndoes  not  appear  driven  by  implicit  cross-debt  guarantees  among  firms  within  a  chaebol.  Such \nguarantees were legally prohibited, and our findings hold when we aggregate chaebol-affiliated \nfirms up to the group level and treat an entire chaebol as just one observation. Less exposure to \nthe Korean crisis because of international business or better export opportunities also does not \nappear  to  explain  our  findings.  Our  findings  are  robust  to  controlling  for  firms\u2019  level  of  exports \nand  to  using  within-industry  comparisons.  There  is  also  no  evidence  that  in  the  absence  of  a \ngovernment bailout, chaebol-affiliated firms were a lower default risk after the crisis. We find that \nthe default rate of chaebol-affiliated firms was actually higher than that of non-chaebol firms. \n\n \nOverall,  this  evidence  is  consistent  with  Korean  investors  believing  the  very  largest \nKorean  chaebol  were  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  in  1998\u2015despite  explicit  attempts  by  the  government  to \nestablish  and  implement  a  no  bailout  policy.  When  the  entire  set  of  firms  in  a  chaebol  group \nwere  very  large  relative  to  the  economy  or  sufficiently  important  to  key  components  of  the \neconomy, it made sense for investors to expect that the government would, one way or another, \neventually and substantially ride to their rescue.8 It is very hard to commit not to save massive \nfirms  and  their  investors\u2015because  of  the  systemic  implications,  and  investors  know  this.9 Of \ncourse,  if  investors  believe  there  will  be  such  a  rescue,  they  will  reward  bigger  firms  with \ncheaper access to finance, further solidifying these firms\u2019 status as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. The Korean \nevidence  suggests  that  a  government  commitment\u2015no  matter  how  binding\u2015to  not  bail  out \nlarge firms is unlikely to eliminate \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs because it is not time consistent and, in \na crisis, emergency measures can always be brought in to help investors. \n\n \nMost  of  the  established  literature  on  the  issue  of  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  has  focused  on  the \nfinancial  sector  and  has  been  relatively  informal\u2015although  quite  prescient,  e.g.,  Stern  and \nFeldman (2004), which anticipated many of the global issues seen in 2008\u20132009. Drawing on \nexperience in the 1990s, Summers (2000) summarizes best practice for policy: \u201cIt is certain that \na  healthy  financial  system  cannot  be  built  on  the  expectation  of  bailouts.\u201d  Our  paper  expands \nthe  set  of  retrospective  experiences  when  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  was  a  relevant  consideration  to \nnonfinancial  conglomerates,  which  can  also  pose  a  systematic  risk  when  they  account  for  a \nsignificant share of the domestic economy. The case of the Republic of Korea strongly suggests \nthat the more general study of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d should not be limited to the financial sector alone. \n\n \nOur  evidence  fits  well  with  the  idea  that  vested  interests  play  an  important  role  in \nfinancial  development  (Morck,  Wolfenzon,  and  Yeung  2005)  and  suggests  links  between  \u201ctoo \nbig  to  fail\u201d  and  the  broader  evidence  that  firm-level  governance  and  financing  arrangements \nmatter for country-level macroeconomic outcomes. The link seems to be particularly strong for \ncrises  in  emerging  markets  where  firms  with  weaker  corporate  governance  are  more  likely  to \nsuffer  stock  price  declines  when  a  crisis  hits  (Johnson  et  al.  2000,  Mitton  2002,  Lemmon  and \nLins 2003).10 \n \nOur  analysis  of  the  Republic  of  Korea's  bond  market  also  relates  to  growing  evidence \nregarding  the  importance  of  legal  institutions  for  financial  development  (Beck,  Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, \n\n                                                 \n8  Additionally, part of this \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d belief may be driven by the largest chaebols being household brand names \nin the Republic of Korea (e.g., Samsung, Daewoo, Hyundai, LG, and SK), which would only bolster the belief of \ninvestors and households that these firms would never be allowed to fail. \n\n9  This  idea  is  similar  to  that  of  Bhattacharya  (2003),  which  derives  a  model  where  agents  rationally  participate  in \ngigantic  Ponzi  schemes  because  they  correctly  believe  that  a  partial  bailout  is  possible  when  the  scheme \neventually collapses.  \n\n10  This literature builds directly on the measurement of investor protection in La Portaet al. (1997 and 1998). \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   5 \n\n \n \nand  Levine  2003)  and  how  market-based  or  bank-based  financial systems  may  independently \nmatter for economic development and growth (Beck and Levine 2002). Our paper builds upon \nexisting work concerning business groups in the Republic of Korea (Bae, Kang, and Kim 2002), \nthe  separation  of  ownership  and  control  frequently  found  in  these  firms  (Claessens,  Djankov, \nand Lang 2000), and the readjustment of credit extended to these groups following the financial \ncrisis (Borensztein and Lee 2002).  \n\n \nThe  remainder  of  the  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  Section  I  explains  the  nature  of  the \nRepublic  of  Korea's  financial  system  through  the  mid-1990s.

Section V \noffers some additional analysis of loans and profitability, and Section VI concludes.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nII. REPUBLIC OF KOREA\u2019S CHAEBOLS AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM \n\nIn  this  section,  we  briefly  describe  the  size  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  largest  chaebols  in \nrelation to the economy prior to the financial crisis in 1997\u20131998, and also the development of \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s financial market during the crises years. We place particular emphasis \non the development of the country\u2019s corporate bond market, which provided a primary channel \nthrough which firms, particularly the largest chaebols, raised capital following the crisis in 1998. \n \nA. \n\nRepublic of Korea\u2019s Chaebols and Financial Markets, Pre-1998 \n \n\nChaebols\u2015groups of firms in the Republic of Korea connected through complicated ownership \nstructures\u2015dominate the Korean economy. There were hundreds of such chaebols prior to the \nfinancial  crisis  in  1997,  but  the  largest  five  and  next  largest  25  chaebols  were  generally \nconsidered to be in a class of their own in terms of size. The five largest chaebols prior to the \ncrises,  in  terms  of  total  assets,  were  Hyundai,  Samsung,  LG,  Daewoo,  and  SK.  These  five \nchaebols alone had combined sales of 225 trillion won (W) in 1996. These sales are significant \nrelative to the size of the Republic of Korea\u2019s entire gross domestic product (GDP) at the time, \nW448.6 trillion. The next largest 25 chaebols also accounted for a significant share of sales in \n1996. Total sales of these 25 chaebols were W86 trillion in 1996.11 The market share of these \nchaebols, particularly the largest five, facilitated what many considered to be a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \nbelief by investors (Krueger and Yoo 2002). \n\n \nThe  chaebols\u2019  enormous  size  is  partially  attributed  to  their  success  as  exporters, \ncombined  with  subsidized  credit  from  the  government,  during  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s. \nFrom the 1960s into the 1980s, the Republic of Korea\u2019s financial system, which was dominated \nby  state-owned  banks,  allocated  credit  at  the  behest  of  the  government.  These  directed  bank \ncredits were provided to firms that fulfilled government priorities, particularly through developing \nexports.  Korean  chaebols  were  adept  beneficiaries  of  this  system,  allowing  them  to  capture  a \nsignificant share of the economy.12  \n\n \nIn  the  early  1990s,  there  were  attempts  by  the  government  to  switch  towards  a  more \nmarket-based  financial  system,  but  almost  all  external  financing  for  firms  continued  to  flow \nthrough banks. Official aggregate flows of funds data from the Bank of Korea demonstrate this. \nBefore 1997, total annual net financial flows to the corporate sector were around 25% of GDP, \n\n                                                 \n11  We calculate the sales of the largest chaebols using our NICE data,  which is described in Section II. The gross \n\ndomestic product is provided by the Bank of Korea and given in Appendix Table II. \n12  See Krueger and Yoo (2002) for more details on the history and growth of chaebols. \n\n\f6   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nof  which  financial  intermediaries  provided  between  45%  and  60%. 13  The  largest  chaebols \naccounted  for  a  significant  share  of  these  bank  loans.  About  44%  of  net  finance  flows  from \nfinancial  intermediaries  in  1996  went  to  the  largest  five  chaebols  in  1996.  Other  important \nsources of funds before the crisis were commercial paper (17.5% of all funding in 1996), stocks \n(10.9%), and overseas borrowing (10.4%).  \n\n \nDespite its large nominal size, the corporate bond market was quite inactive prior to the \ncrisis. Corporate bonds issued prior to 1998 were essentially disguised bank loans rather than \ncapital  market  instruments  as  Korean  banks  routinely  guaranteed  corporate  bonds  and  held \nthem to the maturity. Bond investment by banks was an alternative method to extend loans to a \nspecific  company  when  banks  could  not  extend  loans  to  the  company  due  to  loan  exposure \nregulation.  By  investing  in  bonds,  banks  could  escape  the  regulation  which  limited  loan \nexposure  per  firm  as  bond  holdings  were  classified  as  portfolio  investments,  not  loans.  The \ngovernment's  regulation  on  interest  rates  also  hampered  the  development  of  corporate  bond \nmarkets. Instead of putting a ceiling on interest rates, the government took an indirect approach. \nIt  controlled  the  supply  of  corporate  bonds  (new  issuance  of  corporate  bonds  had  to  be  pre-\napproved) to manage market interest rates.  \n \nB. \n\nChaebols, the Post-Crisis Bond Market, and Bailouts \n \n\nFollowing  the  financial  crisis  in  1997,  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  financial  markets,  which  had \nhistorically  favored  the  largest  chaebols,  changed  dramatically.  In  response  to  the  crisis,  the \nRepublic  of  Korea\u2019s  banks  dramatically  curtailed  their  lending.  Net  financial  flows  from  the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  intermediaries  were  a  negative  W15.9  trillion  in  1998,  indicating  net \nrepayment of loans. Because of their high leverage, this drop in bank loans, a primary source of \ncapital for the largest chaebols, likely posed a significant challenge for chaebol-affiliated firms. \nThe median debt-to-equity ratio of firms affiliated with a top five chaebol was 3.9 in 1997, and \nthe  median  debt-to-equity  ratio  of  firms  affiliated  with  the  next  largest  25  chaebols  was  3.6. \nFirms affiliated with Hyundai had a median debt-to-equity ratio of 5.1 in 1997. \n\n \nAt  the  same  time,  government  policy  towards  propping  up  failing  banks  and  firms  also \nchanged. The  Republic of Korea government, backed by the IMF and the US Treasury, stated \nthere  would  be  no  money  to  protect  individual  firms,  and  this  was  enshrined  in  the  country\u2019s \nLetter of Intent with the IMF at the very end of 1997.14 These shifts were intended to signal that \nno firm was \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and that government aid would not be forthcoming for troubled firms. \nThese  shifts  were  substantiated  by  the  government\u2019s  willingness  to  allow  some  smaller \nchaebols  to  go  bankrupt.  Hanil,  the  27th  largest  chaebol  in  1997,  entered  bankruptcy  in  the \nsecond  half  of  1998.  New  Core  and  Geopyung,  ranked  27th  and  28th  in  size  in  1998,  also \nsubsequently went bankrupt. \n\n \nDespite their high leverage and a supposed unwillingness of the government to bailout \nfailing firms, the chaebol-affiliated firms obtained new financing in 1998 rather easily. This was \n\n                                                 \n13  For example, in 1996 total financing to the corporate sector was W118,769 billion. Of this, 14% came from bank \nlending directly and 17.5% came from banks through their purchases of bonds. A further 13.9% came from non-\nbank financial intermediaries. See Appendix Table II for the complete aggregate finance data from 1990\u20132002. \n14  From the December 3, 1997, letter (http://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/120397.HTM): paragraph 35, \u201cTo strengthen \nmarket discipline, bankruptcy provisions according to Korean law  will be  allowed to  operate  without government \ninterference.  No  government  subsidized  support  or  tax  privileges  will  be  provided  to  bail  out  individual \ncorporations\u201d; paragraph 17, \u201cAll support to financial institutions, other than Bank of Korea liquidity credits, will be \nrecorded transparently in the fiscal accounts\u201d; and the tight fiscal policy laid out in paragraphs 13 and 14. These \ncommitments were reinforced in a second Letter of Intent on 24 December 1997. \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   7 \n\n \n \naccomplished by their ability to raise significant amounts of capital through bond issues as part \nof  an  overall  surge  in  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  bond  market  at  the  time.  The  monthly  average \namount of corporate bonds issued was less than W3 trillion prior to the crisis. But, the monthly \naverage  increased  to  W7  trillion  in  the  second  half  of  1998,  and  for  all  of  1998,  the  Bank  of \nKorea  reports  net  bond  financing  was  W45.9  trillion.15 Moreover,  the  net  finance  flows  from \nbonds  in  1998  roughly  equaled  the  net  flows  of  financial  intermediaries  before  the  crisis.  Net \nbond flows were 9.5% of GDP in 1998, whereas net flows of indirect finance (i.e., banks) were \nabout  9%  of  GDP  from  1990\u20131997.  The  dramatic  switch  from  bank-based  finance  to  issuing \nbonds is shown in Figure 1, which shows the main net financial flows to the Korean corporate \nsector during the 1990s as reported by the Bank of Korea.16 \n\n \n \nFigure 1: Aggregate Net Financial Flows by Year (won billion) \n \n\nn\no\nW\nn\no\n\n \n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nB\n\n120,000\n105,000\n90,000\n75,000\n60,000\n45,000\n30,000\n15,000\n0\n\u221215,000\n\u221230,000\n\n1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\nBonds\n\nEquity\n\nFinancial Intermediaries\n\n \n\nNote: This figure reports the aggregate corporate net financial flows for equity, bonds, and loans, by year. \n\nSource: Bank of Korea. \n \n \nWhile the government\u2019s decision to no longer control the supply of corporate bonds was \na  contributing  factor  in  the  bond  market\u2019s  sudden  development,  the  primary  driver  was  a \ndrawing  down  of  bank  deposits  by  households  and  the  reinvestment  of  these  savings  in \ncorporate  bonds.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  households  moved  their  savings  to \ncorporate bonds for two main reasons.17 First, individuals perceived bonds issued by chaebol-\naffiliated  firms  to  be  safe  investments  irrespective  of  government  commitments  to  not  bail  out \nthese  firms.  Second,  banks\u2015many  of  which  were  recently  taken  over  by  the  government \nbecause  of  the  crisis\u2015could  not  compete  with  the  higher  interest  rates  offered  by  corporate \nbonds.  In  January  1998,  the  three-year  bank  deposit  rate  was  17%  whereas  the  three-year \ncorporate bond yield (AA rating) was 24%. The introduction of asset-backed securities and the \nsecuritization  of  bad  bank  loans  also  helped  diversify  the  products  available  to  investors  and \ndeepen their demand for bonds in 1998.  \n\n                                                 \n15  Using an average exchange rate of W1,400 per dollar in 1998, this is about $32.8 billion. \n16  The  type  of  corporate  bond  issued  also  changed  drastically  with  the  crisis  as  guaranteed  corporate  bonds \nimmediately disappeared from the market. Due to new restrictions put in place by the government after the crisis, \nbanks  and  other  institutional  investors\u2019  ability  to  provide  a  financial  guarantee  to  bond  issuers  was  severely \ncurtailed, and almost all corporate bonds issued after the crisis were non-guaranteed bonds.  \n\n17  This anecdotal evidence is based on discussions with leading Korean bond experts. Detailed data on household \n\nsavings and the purchasers of corporate bonds in the Republic of Korea is not available. \n\n\f8   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \n\nThe dramatic growth of the bond market slowed after the government placed a limit on \nthe amount of bonds that chaebol-affiliated firms could issue on 28 October 1998. This limit was \nimplemented  out  of  concerns  that  the  largest  chaebols  were  accumulating  large  amounts  of \ndebt that they would not be able to repay. These concerns were justified in July 1999 when the \nDaewoo  group,  the  third  largest  chaebol  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  at  the  time  and  one  of  the \nlargest issuers of bonds in 1998, declared bankruptcy.  \n\n \nImmediately  after  the  Daewoo  bankruptcy,  the  amount  of  corporate  bonds  issued  was \nalmost negligible, as investors became very sensitive to corporate credit risk and the possibility \nthat the largest chaebols might not be \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. The average monthly issuance of bonds \nfor  the  first  half  of  1999  was  W2.9  trillion,  and  the  total  amount  of  bonds  issued  in  July  and \nAugust  1999  was  W2.4  trillion  and  W2.5  trillion,  respectively.  In  September  1999,  however, \ncorporate bonds issued fell to W162 billion, and only averaged W680 billion for the remainder of \n1999. Total monthly bonds issued did not again exceed W2 trillion until February 2001.  \n\n \nDespite  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  not  bail  out  firms,  lenders  to  the  largest \nchaebols  were  eventually  protected  against  losses  to  a  large  degree  in  1999  and  2000  by \ngovernment action. After Daewoo\u2019s bankruptcy, the Korea Asset Management Company, set up \nwith public funds, purchased Daewoo\u2019s non-performing loans and debts, which were estimated \nat more than $57 billion. Oh and Rhee (2002) estimate that investors made back 95% of their \ninitial  investment  in  Daewoo  because  of  these  emergency  measures  put  in  place  by  the \ngovernment. Hyundai, another large issuer of debt in 1998 also had an actual default in 2000. \nUnable to rollover its debt, the company was only able to avoid bankruptcy through government \nmeasures initiated to avoid another collapse similar to Daewoo. Through these measures, the \nKorean Development Bank purchased bonds from Hyundai and other troubled companies, thus \nshielding bond investors from potential losses.18 \n\n \nWhy were chaebol-affiliated firms able to issue so many bonds after the crisis and after \nthe  government  stated  there  would  be  no  money  to  protect  individual  firms?  Were  these \nfinancial flows to the largest firms because these firms were better run or had better projects at \nthe time, or was it just that investors still saw them as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d? To address this question, \nwe now turn to our empirical specification.  \n\n \n \n\nIII. EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION \n \nTo analyze whether \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d perceptions among bond investors may have contributed to \nchaebol-affiliated  firms\u2019  ability  to  access  bonds  in  1998,  we  need  to  test  whether  chaebol \naffiliation is associated with better access to bond financing after controlling for firms\u2019 investment \nopportunities and underlying default risk. For example, one relationship of interest is: \n \nF\ni\n\nChaebol\n\n\uf02b \uf0d7\n\uf061 \uf062\n\n\uf02b \uf047 \uf0d7\n\n(1) \n\n\uf065\ni\n\nP\ni\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf03d\n\nj T\n, ,\n\nj T\n, ,\n\nj T\n, ,\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere \n\n is a measure of the finance obtained by firm i in industry j and period T, i.e., after the \n\n \nj TF\nj TP  is  a  measure  of  the  expected  return  on  the  firm's  projects  in  T  (and  beyond),  and \nChaeboli  is an indicator for being affiliated with a large chaebol. We are interested in whether \n\ncrisis, \n\n, ,\n\n, ,\n\ni\n\n \n\n                                                 \n18  See Oh and Rhee (2002) for more details of these emergency measures. \n\n\f \n\nYTM\n\ni\n\nj T\n, ,\n \nWhere, \n\n \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   9 \n\n \n \n0\uf047 \uf03e , which would suggest better access to capital for chaebol-affiliated firms after controlling \nfor investment opportunities. Likewise, another relationship of interest is: \n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf02b \uf0d7\n\uf061 \uf062\n\nRisk\n\n\uf02b \uf047 \uf0d7\n\nChaebol\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf065\ni\n\nj T\n, ,\n\n \n\ni\n\ni\n\nj T\n, ,\n\n(2) \n\nYTM  is a measure of the yield-to-maturity offered on bond issues of firm i in industry \n\ni\n\nj T\n, ,\n\nj after the crisis, and \n\nRisk\n\n is a measure of the underlying default risk (absent a government \n\ni\n\nj T\n, ,\n\n0\uf047 \uf03c ,  which  would \nbailout)  on  the  bonds  issued  by  firm  i.  Now,  we  are  interested  in  whether \nsuggest investors perceived chaebol-affiliated firms as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. The problem is that we \ndo not have a good measure of either expected return, P, or default risk, Risk.  \n\n \nUsing  post-crisis  performance  measures  to  proxy  for  P  is  not  appealing  as  these  are \nlikely  affected  in  part  by  access  to  finance,  causing  a  potential  endogeneity  bias.  Firms  with \naccess to the bond market following the crisis may have performed better simply because they \ncould  obtain  credit  when  other  firms  could  not.  For  example,  Daewoo,  which  issued  a  large \nshare of the bonds in 1998, was probably able to delay bankruptcy because of its ability to issue \nbonds.  Therefore,  using  post-crisis  performance  measures  would  bias  us  towards  finding  a \npositive correlation between performance and financial access. A similar concern arises in trying \nto determine whether these bond issues adequately priced a firm\u2019s default risk, Risk. \n\n \nUsing  other  standard  proxies  for  investment  opportunities,  such  as  Tobin\u2019s  Q,  from \nbefore  the  crisis  to  proxy  for  firms\u2019  expected  return  on  investments  after  the  crisis  is  also  not \nappealing.  A  dramatic  change  in  relative  prices  following  the  crisis  likely  shifted  the  set  of \nprofitable investments to new areas of the economy, and a firm\u2019s performance prior to the crisis \nneed not be a strong predictor of its post-crisis expected returns. Using standard measures of \ndefault  risk  measured  from  before  the  onset  of  the  crisis  is  also  unappealing  for  the  same \nreason.  \n \nTo capture differences in investment opportunities and risk across firms, we instead rely \non  industry  fixed  effects.  Adding  industry  fixed  effects  to  the  above  specifications  will  help \ncontrol  for  unobserved  investment  opportunities  and  risk  attributes  at  the  industry  level  and \nensure  that  we  are  only  estimating  differences  in  post-crisis  access  to  bond  financing  within \nindustries\u2015i.e., are chaebol-affiliated firms able to borrow more and at better terms than other \nfirms in the same industry? \n\n \nAn additional and attractive proxy for the potential risk and return of a firm\u2019s investments \nfollowing  the  crisis  is  a  firm\u2019s  corporate  governance  structure  prior  to  the  crisis.  Recent \ncorporate  governance  literature  suggests  that  corporate  governance  arrangements  matter  for \nfirm-level  performance  (Mitton  2002;  Lemmon  and  Lins  2003;  Morck,  Wolfenzon,  and  Yeung \n2005),  and  there  is  ample  evidence  that  corporate  governance  mattered  for  performance \nspecifically in the Republic of Korea before, during, and after the crisis (Joh 2003; Baek, Kang, \nand Park 2004; Black, Jang, and Kim 2006). Governance structures also tend to be persistent, \nand  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  they  do  not  appear  affected  by  the  financial  crisis.  Thus,  as  an \nadditional control for investment opportunities, we will also test the robustness of our findings to \nincluding controls for firm-level governance. \n\n \nMaking use of these ideas, we estimate the following specification: \n \nF\ni\n\n\uf02b \uf0d7\n\uf061 \uf06c \uf062\nj\n\nChaebol\n\n\uf0d7 \uf02b\n\uf067 \uf065\ni\n\n\uf02b \uf047 \uf0d7\n\nG\ni\n\nj T s\n, ,\n\uf02d\n\nj T s\n, ,\n\uf02d\n\nZ\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf02b\n\nj T\n, ,\n\nj T\n, ,\n\n \n\n'\n\ni\n\ni\n\n(3) \n\n\f10   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nwhere \n\nj TF\n\n, ,\n\ni\n\n is the finance obtained by firm i in industry j and period T, which is after the crisis; \n\nj T sG \uf02d is the corporate governance of firm i in period \nj\uf06c are three-digit industry fixed effects, and \nZ \uf02d\n,'i T s\nT-s,  which  is  before  the  crisis;  and \nis  a  vector  of  firm-level  controls,  which  are  all \nmeasured before the crisis to ensure they are not endogenously related to post-crisis financial \nflows. We estimate a similar regression for the yield-to-maturity of bonds issued in 1998. \n\n, ,\n\ni\n\n \nOur main empirical specifications will rely on industry fixed effects to capture differences \nin  investment  opportunities  and  risk.  Empirical  specifications  that  also  include  corporate \ngovernance as an additional proxy will rely on three assumptions. First, the crisis was a surprise \nto all concerned, so that corporate governance and other arrangements were not designed with \nthe  crisis  in  mind.  Second,  corporate  governance  is  to  some  extent  persistent,  i.e.,  cannot  be \nquickly  changed,  particularly  during  a  crisis.19 Third,  building  on  Joh\u2019s  (2003)  result  that  firms \nwith bad governance performed worse before the crisis, we assume it would be reasonable to \nsuppose that in early 1998 these same firms would not make good use of external funds.  \n\n \n \nIV. DATA DESCRIPTION \n \nIn this section, we describe the construction of variables we will use in our subsequent analysis. \nA more detailed description of how we construct each variable can be found in Appendix Table \n1.  Descriptive  statistics  of  our  key  variables  and  controls  are  provided  in  Tables  1  and  2,  and \npair-wise  correlations  of  key  variables  are  reported  in  Table  3.  As  noted  in  our  empirical \nstrategy, all firm-level controls, including those for chaebol membership, corporate governance, \nand size are measured prior to the financial crisis to ensure they are not endogenously related \nto post-crisis bond flows and yield to maturity, which form our main dependent variables. To that \neffect,  we  construct  all  of  our  firm-level  controls  from  1996  data  to  ensure  they  are  not \ninfluenced  by  financial  crisis  in  mid-  to  late-1997.  All  subsequent  analysis  is  also  robust  to \nconstructing our control variables from 1997 data instead.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n19  The corporate governance measures used in our later specifications are in fact highly persistent.

This is the standard measure used both in the literature and \nby  practitioners  in  the  Republic  of  Korea.  In  our  subsequent  analysis,  a  firm  is  classified  as \nchaebol-affiliated  based  on  the  1996  listing  of  the  top  30  chaebols.  According  to  the  KFTC, \nthere are 343 firms affiliated with a top-30 chaebol in 1996. Because there is a large distinction \nbetween  the  largest  five  chaebols  (Hyundai,  Samsung,  LG,  Daewoo,  and  SK)  and  the  next \nlargest 25 chaebols, in terms of overall size, we also separately identify firms affiliated with a top \nfive chaebols and those that are affiliated with the next 25 largest chaebols.  \n\n \nThere  was  some  merger  activity  during  the  period  of  interest,  and  it  is  not  clear  how \nexactly  to  treat  a  firm  that  joins  or  leaves  a  chaebol.  In  our  base  regressions  and  descriptive \nstatistics, we therefore drop all firms that become a member of a top-30 chaebol during 1997\u2013\n2000 or leave a chaebol during 1997\u20131998. However, in our robustness checks, we add these \nfirms to the sample and confirm that our results are robust to treating these firms as either non-\nchaebol  or  chaebol  and  clustering  the  standard  errors  on  either  pre-  or  post-crisis  chaebol \naffiliation.  \n\nIn our base regressions, we cluster the standard errors by chaebol to avoid overstating \nthe findings, which might occur if financing decisions or idiosyncratic shocks occur at the group \nlevel rather than among individual firms. Our results are robust to not clustering.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   13 \n\n \n \nB.  \n\nFinancial Flows and Firm Characteristics \n \n\nOur  measures  of  firm-level  financial  flows,  i.e.,  bonds,  loans,  and  equity,  are  derived  from \noperating activity cash flow data reported in a dataset compiled by the NICE. One of the largest \ncredit  evaluating  firms  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  NICE  compiles  and  verifies  firms\u2019  annual \nfinancial  statements  submitted  to  the  Korea  Securities  Supervisory  Board.  After  excluding \nobservations  on  financial  firms,  the  NICE  data  set  contains  the  financial  statements  for \napproximately 6,400 nonfinancial firms in 1996 and 8,800 firms by 2000.  \n\n \nThe NICE financial dataset captures a large share of the Republic of Korea\u2019s economy, \nand the aggregate pattern of financial flows for firms in the dataset closely mirror those of the \nentire economy. This is shown in Figure 2, where we calculate the aggregate net equity, bond, \nand  financial  intermediary  flows  by  year  using  NICE.  The  overall  amount  and  changes  in  net \nfinancial  flows  reported  by  NICE  are  very  similar  to  those  reported  by  the  Bank  of  Korea,  as \nreported  in  Figure  1.20 Net  financing  from  loans  is  almost  zero  in  1998,  while  financing  from \nbond issues provides the primary source of capital in 1998. Equity-financing is relatively small, \nexcept in 1999. \n\n \n \nFigure 2: Aggregate Net Financial Flows, as Reported by NICE (billion won) \n \n\nn\no\nW\nn\no\n\n \n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nB\n\n120,000\n105,000\n90,000\n75,000\n60,000\n45,000\n30,000\n15,000\n0\n\u221215,000\n\u221230,000\n\n1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\nBonds\n\nEquity\n\nFinancial Intermediaries plus Commercial Paper\n\n \n\n \n\nNICE = National Information Credit Evaluation. \n\nNote: This figure reports the aggregate corporate net financial flows for equity, bonds, and loans, by year as calculated from the \nNICE dataset. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n\n \n \nThe  chaebol-affiliated  firms,  particularly  those  in  a  top  five  chaebol,  appear  to  issue  a \ndisproportionate share of the bonds in the post-crisis years. This is seen in Table 1, where we \nreport  the  number  of  firms  that  report  positive  cash  inflows  from  bond  issuances  and  the \naverage  gross  bond  flows  normalized  by  assets  for  firms  from  1996\u20132000.  Between  500  and \n600 firms issue bonds each year in the 3 years following the crisis, but about 20% of the issuers \n                                                 \n20  Note  that  the  Bank  of  Korea  construction  of  net  bond  flows  used  in  Figure  1  does  not  include  bonds  issued \noverseas  with  foreign  currency  denomination,  while  our  measurement  of  bond  flows  from  the  NICE  data  does \ninclude  such  bonds.  Moreover,  we  cannot  separate  out  commercial  paper  from  our  loans  in  the  NICE  data. \nDespite these differences in how the two datasets are constructed, the two series show the same general pattern. \n\n\f14   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nare affiliated with a large chaebol even though these firms account for less than 4% of the firms \nin  the  NICE  dataset.  The  chaebol-affiliated  firms  also  issue  far  more  bonds  per  unit  of  assets \nthan non-chaebol firms. The average gross bond flows normalized by assets is around one from \n1997\u20132000 for all firms, and for chaebol-affiliated firms, it is four times larger.  \n\n \nIn 1998, the concentration of bond flows among the largest five chaebols is even starker. \nAverage gross bond flows normalized by assets is 10.9 for firms affiliated with the five largest \nchaebols,  compared  to  just  0.93  for  all  firms.  In  fact,  the  54  firms  associated  with  the  top  five \nchaebols\u2015and  actively  issuing  bonds  in  1998\u2015accounted  for  56%  of  the  gross  bond  flows, \nthough  they  only  account  for  10%  of  the  firms  that  issue  bonds  in  1998.  And  the  59  firms \nassociated with the next 25 largest chaebols and actively issuing bonds in 1998 accounted for \n13% of gross bond flows in 1998.21  \n\n \nThe number of firms with cash inflows from loans or equity in 1998 is larger, but the net \nfinancial  flows  from  loans  and  equity  are  much  smaller  than  that  of  bond  flows.  As  seen  in \nTable 1, approximately 5,000 firms have positive net financial flows from loans in 1998. But, as \nshown in Figures 1 and 2, the net financial flows from the loan market were negative in 1998. \nLikewise,  while  around  1,000  firms  issued  equity  in  1998,  the  aggregate  volume  of  net  equity \nfinancing  did  not  become  sizable  until  1999.  On  aggregate,  the  bond  market  provided  the \nprimary source of capital in the year immediately following the financial crisis. \n\n \nThe  NICE  dataset  also  provides  us  a  number  of  other  key  firm-level  characteristics, \nincluding firm size and leverage, which will be used as controls in our regressions. The log of \ntotal  assets  is  used  to  control  for  overall  firm  size  since  larger  firms  naturally  borrow  more  in \nlevels.  Findings  are  also  robust  to  using  second-,  third-,  and  fourth-order  polynomials  of  total \nassets to control for size or to controlling for size non-parametrically using fixed effects based \non  which  decile  a  firm\u2019s  assets  belong  to  .  A  firm\u2019s  leverage  ratio,  as  measured  by  total  debt \ndivided  by  assets  controls  for  a  firm\u2019s  level  of  indebtedness  and  exposure  to  risk.  We  also \ncontrol for the amount of cash flows generated by the firm. To do this, we calculate a firm\u2019s cash \nflows  normalized  by  assets,  where  cash  flows  are  measured  using  operating  cash  flows  plus \ndepreciation and minus changes in accruals. To control for the volatility of a firm\u2019s cash flow, we \nalso calculate a firm\u2019s cash volatility, which is the standard deviation of cash flows/assets from \n1994\u20131996. Finally, to capture other potential risk exposures beyond leverage, we calculate the \nfirms\u2019 modified Altman Z-score.22 \n\n \nAs  expected,  chaebol-affiliated  firms  are  much  larger  and  less  profitable  than  non-\nchaebol firms prior to the crisis. This is seen in Table 2, which provides descriptive statistics for \nboth the entire sample of firms in NICE and those that issue bonds in 1998. Firms affiliated with \na top-5 chaebol are 3.1 log points larger in total assets than non-chaebol firms, and nearly a log \npoint larger than firms affiliated with the 25 largest chaebols. Overall, firms affiliated with a top \n30  chaebol  account  for  approximately  40%  of  total  assets  and  50%  of  total  sales  in  1996. \nConfirming that the top five are much larger than even the next 25 largest chaebols and more \nlikely to be considered \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, they alone account for 25% of assets and 36% of sales. \nAt the same time, however, firms affiliated with a top 30 chaebol are less profitable than non-\n\n                                                 \n21  Total gross bond flows in 1998 for firms in the NICE data were W71.9 trillion, of which firms in top five chaebols \n\naccounted for W40.2 trillion, and firms in next 25 largest chaebols accounted for W9.1 trillion. \n\n22  Following  MacKie-Mason \n\n(1990),  we  calculate  a  modified-Altman  Z-score  as  3.3*(EBIT/assets)  + \n1.0*(sales/assets)  +  1.4*(retained  earnings/assets)  +  1.2*(working  capital/assets).  Since  we  do  not  have  stock \nprice  data,  we  are  unable  to  calculate  firms\u2019  ratio  of  market  equity  to  book  debt,  and  instead  control  for  book \nleverage separately. \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   15 \n\n \n \nchaebol  firms,  as  captured  by  a  lower  return  on  assets  in  1996.  This  is  also  true  among  the \nsubset of firms that successfully issue bonds in 1998. \n \nC.  \n\nCorporate Governance \n \n\nTo  construct  our  pre-crisis  measures  of  corporate  governance\u2014which  again  will  serve  as  one \nproxy  for  firms\u2019  ability  to  invest  funds  successfully  after  the  financial  crisis  (and  the  likelihood \nthat  such  returns  would  benefit  outside  equity  holders  and  creditors)\u2014we  use  the  NICE \nownership data. This dataset lists the eight largest shareholders and their ownership stake for a \nsubset  of  the  firms  found  in  the  larger  financial  dataset  provided  by  NICE.  Ownership  data  is \navailable  for  approximately  3,500  firms  in  1996.23 We  use  two  variables  to  measure  corporate \ngovernance: control-ownership rights gap and ownership concentration. Both of these variables \nwere used by Joh (2003) and are derived using ownership data provided by NICE.  \n\n \nTo construct these two corporate governance measures, we first calculate the ownership \n(cash flow) and control rights of the controlling family in each firm. Since the controlling family or \nfounders  of  the  firm  are  typically  the  largest  shareholder,  we  calculate  the  ownership  rights of \nthe controlling family by summing up all personal holdings among the largest eight shareholders \nreported  by  NICE.  Thus,  all  institutional  shareholders  (financial  institutions  and  nonfinancial \ncorporations),  foreign  owners,  government,  and  employee  stock  ownership  are  excluded.  It  is \nnecessary  to  sum  overall  personal  shareholdings  since  some  shares  are  often  controlled  by \nspouses  or  family  members  of  the  spouse,  and  it  is  not  possible  to  distinguish  such  family \nconnections  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  as  wives  do  not  adopt  their  husband's  last  name.  The \ncontrol  rights  of  these  shareholders  are  then  approximated  using  the  total  sum  of  ownership \nstakes  for  all  eight  of  the  largest  shareholders,  including  the  non-personal  holdings  excluded \nfrom  the  measure  of  ownership  rights.  The  implicit  assumption  is  that  these  non-personal \nshareholdings among the largest shareholders are companies which are indirectly controlled by \nthe founding family of the firm, which is typically the case in the Republic of Korea.24 \n\n \nOur first measure of corporate governance is the control-ownership rights gap, which is \ncalculated  by  taking  the  difference  between  the  control  and  ownership  rights.  This  measure \ncaptures  the  degree  to  which  ownership  and control  rights  are aligned  within  each  firm.  Firms \nwith  a  greater  spread  between  the  control  and  ownership  stakes  of  the  top  shareholders  are \nmore susceptible to poor management and misaligned incentives\u2015definitely not in the interest \nof  outside  equity  holders  and  creditors.  Therefore,  a  larger  control-ownership  gap  represents \nweaker  corporate  governance  and  should  be  negatively  related  to  firm  performance  and \npositively related to default risk. In fact, this negative correlation with firm performance has been \ndocumented  in  a  number  of  papers  that  analyze  firms  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  (Joh  2003; \nLemmon  and  Lins  2003;  Baek,  Kang,  and  Park  2004),  and  is  also  present  in  our  dataset.  As \nseen in Table 3, where we report correlations between our key variables, the control-ownership \nrights gap is negatively correlated to ROA in 1996.  \n\n \nOur second measure of corporate governance will be the ownership concentration of the \nfirm,  which  is  measured  using  the  ownership  (cash  flow)  rights  of  the  controlling  family.  The \ninability of some institutional or smaller shareholders to exercise voting rights under regulations \nof the Republic of Korea often allows a large shareholder to maintain control with a very small \nownership  stake.  Controlling  shareholders  with  a  larger  ownership  stake  likely  face  better \n\n                                                 \n23  The pattern of total finance flows exhibited in the economy-wide data (Figure 1) and full sample of firms (Figure 2) \n\nalso persists in the more restricted sample of firms with ownership data.  \n\n24  See Joh (2003) for more details on constructing the both measures of corporate governance. \n\n\f16   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \nincentives,  and  thus,  greater  ownership  concentration  represents  a  firm  with  better  corporate \ngovernance and should be positively related to firm performance\u2015and to the prospect that bond \nholders will be repaid. Again, a number of papers have shown this positive correlation between \nownership  concentration  and  firm  performance  to  be  true  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  (Joh  2003; \nMitton 2002; Baek, Kang, and Park 2004), and we find it in our dataset as well. This is shown in \nTable 3.  \n\n \nThe summary statistics also support the anecdotal evidence that chaebol-affiliated firms \nexhibit very weak corporate governance structures. As seen in Table 2, chaebol-affiliated firms \nhave a much larger control-ownership gap and lower ownership concentration than non-chaebol \nfirms. The control-ownership rights gap is more than twice as large for chaebol-affiliated firms in \nboth the full sample of firms and in the smaller sample of firms that issue bonds in 1998. And, \nownership  concentration  of  chaebol-affiliated  firms  averages  only  7%\u201310%  compared  to  48% \nfor non-chaebol firms in the full sample and 32% in the sample of non-chaebol firms that issue \nbonds in 1998.  \n \nAs  required  for  our  empirical  strategy,  the  corporate  governance  measures  are  also \nhighly persistent over time for firms. From 1993\u20131997, both measures exhibit serial correlation \ncoefficients  of  about  0.93.  Additionally,  as  is  shown  in  later  analysis,  both  measures  are \ncorrelated with firm performance following the financial crisis. This supports our assumption that \nthese  measures  provide  valid  proxies  for  firms\u2019  ability  to  invest  funds  successfully  after  the \nfinancial crisis. \n \n \n\nV. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION \n\n \nA.  \n\nAccess to Bonds in 1998 \n \n\nFirms  affiliated  with  the  largest  chaebols  received  a  disproportionate  amount  of  the  bond \nfinancing in 1998. This is seen in Table 4, column (i), where we regress the log of gross bond \nflows  in  1998  onto  pre-crisis  measures  of  firm\u2019s  chaebol  affiliation,  industry  fixed  effects,  and \nother  firm-level  controls  for  size  and  leverage.  The  top  five  chaebol  dummy  is  positive  and \nhighly  significant.  Being  a  member  of  a  top  five  chaebol  is  associated  with  a  1.2  log  point \nincrease in gross bond flows for a firm in 1998 relative to other firms in the same industry that \nalso  issue  bonds  in  that  year.  This  effect  is  large.  One  log  point  in  the  gross  bond  flows \nregression is about half a standard deviation in our sample, and the average log of gross bond \nflows in 1998 for all firms in the Republic of Korea is 16.2. The dummy for being a chaebol in the \ntop 30 (but not the top five) is also significant, though the magnitude of the effect is about one-\nthird  of  that  observed  for  the  largest  five  chaebols.25 As  expected,  size  is  a  strong  positive \npredictor of gross bond flows and leverage is a negative predictor.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n25  The  smaller  coefficient  for  the  next  largest  25  chaebols  likely  reflects  that  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  beliefs  were  less  for \nthese firms. As noted earlier, these next 25 largest chaebols were considerably smaller than the top five chaebols, \nand the government tried to establish a  no  bailout policy  by allowing Hanil, the 27th largest chaebol in 1997, to \nenter bankruptcy in the second half of 1998.  \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nTop 5 Chaebol \n  \nTop 6\u201330 Chaebol \n  \nLog(Assets) \n  \nDebt/Assets \n  \nOwnership Concentration \n  \nControl-Ownership Difference \n  \nCash Flows / Assets \n  \nCash Volatility \n  \nModified Altman Z-Score \n  \nIndustry Fixed Effects \nObservations \nR-squared \n\n \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   17 \n\nTable 4: Post-Crisis Bond Flows, Chaebol Affiliation and Governance \n\nDependent Variable = \n \n\nLog(Bond Flows in 1998) \n\n(i)\n1.234*** \n(0.275) \n0.516** \n(0.213) \n1.004*** \n(0.049) \n\u20131.165** \n(0.570) \n\n(ii)\n1.352*** \n(0.355) \n0.536* \n(0.289) \n1.136*** \n(0.076) \n\u20132.021*** \n(0.699) \n0.251 \n(0.467) \n\n(iii) \n1.463*** \n(0.348) \n0.596** \n(0.295) \n1.108*** \n(0.072) \n\u20131.887*** \n(0.629) \n\n\u20130.586* \n(0.324) \n\nYes \n504 \n0.75 \n\nYse \n349 \n0.76 \n\nYse \n349 \n0.76 \n\n(iv)\n1.303*** \n(0.254) \n0.579*** \n(0.211) \n1.027*** \n(0.053) \n\u20131.059* \n(0.573) \n\n1.662* \n(1.003) \n2.442 \n(1.959) \n\u20130.002 \n(0.016) \nYes \n476 \n0.76 \n\n* = 10% level, ** = 5% level, *** = 1% level.

Using  corporate  governance  structures  prior  to  the \ncrisis  as  another  proxy  for  firms\u2019  post-crisis  ability  to  implement  projects  successfully  after  the \ncrisis, we still find a very strong relationship between chaebol-affiliation and gross bond flows. \nAdding  our  control  for  ownership  concentration  in  column  (ii)  of  Table  4,  we  do  not  find  any \ncorrelation between ownership concentration and bond flows in 1998. But, we do find a negative \nrelationship  between  control-ownership  rights  gap  and  bond  flows  [column  (iii)],  which  weakly \nsuggests that firms with worse governance issued fewer bonds. Both the top five chaebol and \ntop 6\u201330 chaebol indicators, however, remain positive and highly significant predictors of bond \nflows after the crisis.  \n\n \nThe  disproportionate  access  to  bonds  for  firms  affiliated  with  the  largest  chaebols  also \nstrongly suggests that these financial flows were not related to firms\u2019 presumed ability to invest \nthe  funds  successfully.  As  shown  earlier,  chaebol-affiliated  firms  typically  had  the  weakest \ncorporate  governance  structures  and  overall  profitability  prior  to  the  crisis.  As  a  robustness \n\n\f18   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \ncheck, we also confirm that firms\u2019 pre-crisis profitability is also not positively related to post-crisis \nbond flows.  \n\n \nOther  firm-level  differences  in  risk  exposure  or  access  to  cash  do  not  seem  to  explain \nthe preferential access to bond financing for chaebol-affiliated firms. In column (iv) of Table 4, \nwe instead use pre-crisis controls for cash flows, volatility of cash flows, and bankruptcy risk, as \nmeasured  by  the  modified  Altman  z-score.  Again,  both  chaebol  indicators  remain  a  strong \npositive predictor of bond flows. In unreported regressions, the results are also robust to adding \ncontrols  for  exports/sales  and  foreign  currency  borrowings/total  liabilities,  which  suggest  that \nchaebols\u2019 ability to issue bonds is not driven by better export opportunities or better access to \ninternational  capital  markets.  We  also  found  that  the  results  are  robust  to  adding  controls  for \ncash/assets,  R&D  expenses,  market  share,  and  training  expenditures.  And,  as  mentioned \nearlier, all findings are robust to alternative forms of clustering the standard errors. \n\n \nOne possibility is that chaebol-affiliation simply proxies for overall size. As seen in Table \n2, chaebol-affiliated firms are much larger than the average firm. Since larger firms are likely to \nissue  more  bonds,  one  must  worry  that  our  control  of  size,  log(total  assets),  is  insufficient  to \ncapture the importance of size. However, the results for chaebol-affiliation in Table 4 are robust \nto  adding  nonlinear  size  controls  to  the  estimation  such  as  second-,  third-,  and  fourth-order \npolynomial controls for total assets. The findings are also robust to restricting our sample to only \nthe 500 largest firms, based on total assets in 1996, and re-estimating the equation.26 And, the \nresults  are  robust  to  non-parametrically  controlling  for  the  size  of  assets  by  including  fixed \neffects based on which decile a firm\u2019s assets belong to in 1996. \n\n \nAnother  possibility,  however,  may  be  that  investors  perceive  chaebol-affiliated  firms  to \npossess a larger asset base to collateralize the bonds issued by the firm. In particular, chaebol-\naffiliated  firms  may  benefit  from  cross-debt  guarantees  from  their  affiliated  firms,  leading \ninvestors to view the bonds as potentially backed by the entire group\u2019s asset base, rather than \njust the firm\u2019s individual assets. If this were true, then controlling for an individual firm\u2019s assets \nalone  will  not  be  sufficient.  Additionally,  it  is  possible  that  investors  perceive  chaebol-affiliated \nfirms  to  be  safer  investments  because  an  entire  chaebols\u2019  operations  will  be  more  diversified \nthan  that  of  any  single  firm,  providing  another  implicit  benefit  of  any  cross-debt  guarantees  or \ncross-subsidization  within  the  chaebol.  If  this  is  true,  then  controlling  for  an  individual  firm\u2019s \nriskiness  (such  as  cash  flow  volatility  or  the  modified  Altman  Z-Score)  will  not  adequately \ncapture investors\u2019 perception of risk for a chaebol-affiliated firm. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n26  These estimates are reported in Appendix Table III. Our findings are also robust to using net bond finance flows \nnormalized  by  total  assets  as  the  dependent  variable  instead  of  Log(gross  bond  flows).  These  estimates  are \nreported in Appendix Table 4. \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   19 \n\n \n \n\nHowever,  new  cross-debt  guarantees  were  not  allowed  in  the  crisis,  i.e.,  existing \narrangements  stayed  in  place,  but  any  new  debt  issue  (e.g.,  in  the  form  of  bonds)  was  not \nallowed to be cross-guaranteed within a chaebol (or in any other way). This was a condition of \nthe  IMF  loan  that  helped  stabilize  the  macroeconomy,  and  it  was  viewed  as  an  important \nelement of the overall economic policy both by the government and by the US Treasury. There \nwas  rigorous  enforcement  for  the  letter  of  this  rule,  which  pertained  to  explicit  cross-debt \nguarantees.27 Implicit  cross-guarantees,  which  might  occur  through  tunneling  of  cash  among \ngroup members, is also unlikely to explain our findings since the companies issuing bonds were \noften the largest in the chaebol making it unlikely that the other group members had sufficiently \ndeep pockets to bail them out.28 \n\n \nTo further exclude the possibility of implicit cross-debt guarantees driving our results, we \nre-estimate our main regression after aggregating chaebol-affiliated firms up to the group level \nand treating an entire chaebol as just one observation. In particular, we calculate total assets, \ngross bond flows, and our other controls for cash flows and bankruptcy risk at the group level. \nFor  our  corporate  governance  measures,  we  use  the  average  ownership  concentration  and \ncontrol-ownership  rights  gap  of  the  group  members  as  the  proxy  for  the  entire  group.  In \nunreported results, we also tried using the maximum and minimum levels of governance within \nthe group, and the subsequent results were unchanged. Because it is not possible to classify a \ngroups\u2019  industry,  we  do  not  include  industry\u2013year  fixed  effects.  The  estimates  from  these \naggregated regressions are reported in Table 5. \n\n \nThe disproportionate access of chaebol-affiliated firms does not appear driven by implicit \ncross-debt guarantees. As seen in Table 5, column (i), the five largest chaebols still receive a \nmuch larger share of bond financing in 1998 at the group level. The estimates suggest that a top \nfive  chaebol  group  received  about  1.6  log  point  larger  flow  of  bonds  in  1998,  even  after \ncontrolling for the entire group\u2019s level of assets and overall leverage ratio. There is also still a \nlarge, positive relation between bond financing and affiliation with a top 6\u201330 chaebol, though it \nis  no  longer  always  statistically  significant  at  conventional  levels.  Again,  we  find  no  relation \nbetween corporate governance and bond financing in 1998 [columns (ii)\u2013(iii)]. Controlling for the \noverall cash flows, cash volatility, and modified Altman Z-score of the group [column (iv)] also \ndoes not affect the large, positive relation between bond financing and the chaebol indicators.29 \nIn  unreported  regressions,  the  results  are  also  robust  to  adding  controls  for  exports/sales, \nforeign  currency  borrowings/total  liabilities,  cash/assets,  research  and  development  expenses, \nand market share. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n27  See  paragraph  37 \n\nin \n\nthe  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  3  December  1997  Letter  of \n\nIMF: \n(http://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/120397.htm).

The results are robust to industry fixed effects and numerous controls \nfor  the  overall  size  of  these  firms  and  the  possibility  that  investors  may  have  perceived  the \nexistence  of  cross-debt  guarantees  among  firms  within  a  chaebol.  Moreover,  there  is  no \nevidence  that  bond  were  related  to  our  alternative  measure  of  firm  performance,  corporate \ngovernance from prior to the crisis. The primary beneficiaries of bonds, firms affiliated with the \nlargest  five  chaebols,  on  average,  had  very  poor  corporate  governance  structures.  This \nevidence appears to run counter to the notion that bond investors sought out firms best able to \ninvest  funds.  Instead,  it  suggests  that  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d  beliefs  may  have  affected  investors\u2019 \nwillingness to buy massive amounts of bonds from firms affiliated with chaebols.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   21 \n\n \n \nB.  \n\nYield to Maturity and Default Risk \n \n\nIt  is  possible,  however,  that  the  poor  corporate  governance  and  default  risk  of  firms  issuing \nbonds  was  instead  accounted  for  in  the  return  (yield  to  maturity  [YTM])  of  the  bonds  being \nissued. To test this, we obtained data on the YTM for every publicly placed corporate bond in \nthe  Republic  of  Korea  along  with  the  amount  and  issue  date  of  each  bond  issuance.  In  total, \nthere were 1,175 public bond issues in 1998. Using company names, we match the issuance-\nlevel data to a firm\u2019s financial and chaebol-affiliation data used in the previous regressions. After \ndoing this and excluding financial firms, we were left with data on 737 bond issues in 1998.  \n\n \nUsing a similar specification as before, we regress a bond\u2019s YTM at time of issuance in \n1998  on  industry-fixed  effects  and  firm-level  characteristics  measured  using  pre-crisis  (1996) \ndata. We are interested in seeing whether pre-crisis corporate governance or chaebol-affiliation \nwas priced by investors purchasing bonds in 1998. This would indicate that the disproportionate \namount of bonds issued by the chaebol-affiliated firms and other firms with the poor corporate \ngovernance  were  at  least  priced  appropriately.  To  capture  any  aggregate  monthly  trend  in \ninterest rates throughout 1998, we also include monthly time dummies in the regression.

On  average,  top  five  chaebol-affiliated  bonds  were  issued  at  a  YTM  about  1.7 \npercentage points less than other firms in the same industry [Table 6, column (i)]. The negative \ncorrelation between YTM and top five chaebol affiliation holds even after controlling for firm size \nand  leverage  [column  (ii)].  In  unreported  regressions,  we  also  find  the  negative  correlation  is \nrobust to controlling for firm\u2019s potential exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, as captured by \nexports/sales and foreign currency borrowings/total liabilities. This negative correlation indicates \nthat investors did not perceive the bonds issued by firms affiliated with the top five chaebols to \nbe risky investments. There is less evidence, however, that firms in a 25 next largest chaebols \nissued bonds at lower YTMs on average than non-chaebol firms.  \n\n \nThe lower YTM on the bond issues of chaebol-affiliated firms is robust to including our \nalternative proxy for default risk\u2015a firm\u2019s pre-crisis corporate governance. Neither measure of \ncorporate  governance  is  significantly  related  to  YTM  in  1998,  suggesting  that  corporate \ngovernance  was  not  priced  by  investors,  and  a  top  five  chaebol  affiliation  is  still  strongly  and \nnegatively related to YTM [Table 6, columns (iii)\u2013(iv)]. Moreover, the fact that top five chaebol-\naffiliated firms were able to issue bonds at a lower YTM than the average firm, despite chaebol-\naffiliated  firms  typically  had  the  worst  governance  and  profitability  prior  to  the  crisis,  further \nsuggests that investors willingness to hold these bonds was not related to firms\u2019 ability to invest \nthe funds successfully.  \n\n \nChaebol-affiliated firms\u2019 ability to issue bonds at a lower YTM also does not appear to be \nrelated to the amount or maturity of the bonds being issued by these firms. There was very little \nvariation in the maturity of the bonds in 1998; about two-thirds of the bonds were issued with a \nstandard  three-year  maturity,  and  nearly  all  of  the  rest  had  a  one-  or  two-year  maturity.  And \nadding controls for the size of issue also does not affect our findings [Table 7, column (i)].  \n\n \nOne  possibility,  however,  is  that  chaebol-affiliated  firms  were  less  likely  to  default  for \nother reasons not captured by size, leverage, or greater ability to invest funds successfully (as \nmeasured  by  industry  fixed  effects  and  pre-crisis  corporate  governance),  issuance  size,  or \nmaturity. To test for this possibility, we next added a control for a firms\u2019 overall credit rating at \nthe time of the bond issuance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nTop 5 Chaebol \n  \nTop 6\u201330 Chaebol \n  \nLog(Total Assets) \n  \nDebt / Assets \n  \nLog(Amount Issued) \n  \nCredit Rating \n  \nEventual Default \n  \n  \nIndustry Fixed Effects \nTime (Month) Dummies \nObservations \nR-squared \n\n \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   23 \n\nTable 7: Bond YTMs and Default Risk \n \n\nDependent Variable = \n \n\n(i)\n\u20132.066*** \n(0.575) \n1.027 \n(0.838) \n0.224 \n(0.270) \n2.784* \n(1.640) \n\u20130.129 \n(0.347) \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nYes \nYes \n737 \n0.41 \n\nYTM of Bond Issue \n(ii)\n\u20131.858* \n(1.077) \n1.14 \n(0.955) \n0.879** \n(0.347) \n1.895 \n(2.771) \n\u20130.337 \n(0.309) \n\u20130.107 \n(0.126) \n\n  \n  \n\nYes \nYes \n506 \n0.55 \n\n(iii)\n\u20132.059*** \n(0.575) \n1.039 \n(0.831) \n0.22 \n(0.266) \n2.738* \n(1.608) \n\u20130.135 \n(0.357) \n\n  \n  \n0.188 \n(0.580) \n\nYes \nYes \n737 \n0.41 \n\n* = 10% level, ** = 5% level, *** = 1% level, OLS = ordinary least squares, YTM = yield to maturity. \n\nNotes: \n1.

Bankruptcy equals 1, if a firm declared bankruptcy between 1999\u20132001. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n\n \n \nTo control for credit ratings, we obtained the history of credit ratings reported by three of \nthe  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  largest  credit  rating  agencies:  NICE,  Korea  Investors  Service,  and \nKorea  Ratings  Corporation.  Following  the  financial  crises,  each  firm  making  a  public  issue  of \nbonds  was  required  to  obtain  a  credit  rating  from  two  credit  agencies.  We  then  match  these \ncredit ratings to the bond issuance data using company names and transform each rating into a \nnumerical value. For example, an AAA credit rating is assigned a score of 26, whereas a credit \nscore of AAA\u2013 is assigned a score of 25, and so on. If the two agencies reporting a credit rating \nfor the firm differ in their rating, we take the average of the two ratings. Of the 737 bond issues \nthat we have YTM and firm-level data, we are able to match credit ratings for 506 of the bond \nissues.  \n \nSurprisingly, there is no evidence to indicate that a bond\u2019s YTM was related to a firm\u2019s \ncredit  rating  [Table  7,  column  (ii)].  While  the  coefficient  is  negative,  the  estimate  is  not \nstatistically  significant.  Chaebol  affiliation  remains  a  strong,  negative  predictor  of  YTM.  This \nindicates that chaebol-affiliated firms\u2019 lower YTM is not driven by a better credit rating and that \nchaebol-affiliated  firms  were  able  to  issue  bonds  at  a  lower  YTM  relative  to  firms  of  similar \nindustry, size, leverage, and credit rating. \n\n\f24   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \n\nThe  lack  of  significant,  negative  correlation  between  YTM  and  credit  ratings  may  be \nexplained by the relative newness of the bond market or \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d belief on behalf of the \nindividuals  constructing  these  ratings.  Credit  agencies  may  simply  have  been  ill-equipped  to \nassess  accurately  firms\u2019  likelihood  of  defaulting  on  their  bonds,  and  investors  were  correct  to \nignore these credit ratings. There is evidence to suggest this may have been the case. In 1998, \nthere is actually a positive, statistically significant correlation between credit ratings and whether \nthe  bond  eventually  defaulted.  In  other  words,  bonds  issued  in  1998  that  eventually  defaulted \nwere given a better credit rating on average.  \n\n \nIndividual investors, however, do not seem to have been any better at predicting default \nfor bonds issued in 1998. If we instead proxy for a bonds\u2019 risk using ex-post data on which firms \nactually  declared  bankruptcy  between  1999\u20132001,  we  find  no  significant  correlation  between \neventual  default  and  YTM  at  time  of  issue  in  1998  [Table  7,  column  (iii)].  In  fact,  in  a  simple \nregression of YTM onto an indicator for eventual default and monthly dummies in 1998, we find \nthat  YTM  and  eventual  default  were  negatively  related.  While  the  estimate  is  not  statistically \nsignificant  at  conventional  levels  (t-stat  =  1.5),  it  certainly  is  not  consistent  with  investors \naccurately pricing default risk in 1998. \n\n \nThere  is  also  no  evidence  that  chaebol-affiliated  firms,  without  a  government  bailout, \nwere less likely to eventually default on their bonds. In a regression of an indicator for eventual \ndefault onto our indicators for chaebol affiliation\u2014monthly dummies and industry dummies\u2014we \nfind that bonds issued by firms affiliated with a chaebol were actually more likely to experience \nan eventual default. While the estimate is not statistically significant at conventional levels (t-stat \n=1.2),  bonds  issued  by  top  five  chaebol  firms  were  8.5  percentage  points  more  likely  to \nexperience  default.  Bonds  issued  by  the  next  largest  25  chaebols  were  1.2  percentage  points \nmore  likely  to  experience  default,  but  again  the  estimate  is  not  statistically  significant  (t-stat  = \n0.44). \n\n \nThese findings are striking as they are the opposite of what one would expect to find in a \nwell-functioning  bond  market.  Not  only  were  the  largest  finance  flows  being  directed  towards \nfirms with the worst corporate governance, it would appear investors perceived these to be safe \ninvestments\u2015bonds issued by chaebol-affiliated firms sold at a premium relative to other bonds. \nIn  fact,  chaebol-affiliated  firms  that  did  eventually  default,  such  as  Daewoo  and  Hyundai, \nactually sold debt at a greater premium (lower interest rate) than bonds issued by firms affiliated \nwith  other  chaebols,  and  investors  appeared  indifferent  to  credit  ratings.  Overall,  the  pricing \nevidence  is  consistent  with  households  ex  ante  regarding  these  corporate  bonds  as  safe \ninvestments and the large chaebol-affiliated firms as \u201ctoo large to fail\u201d in 1998.  \n\n \n \n\nVI. LOANS AND PROFITABILITY \n \n\nA.  \n\nPre-crisis Loans and Chaebol Affiliation \n \n\nSo far, the evidence suggests that the bond market disproportionately favored chaebol-affiliated \nfirms,  and  this  preferential  access  appears  consistent  with  a  \u201ctoo  large  to  fail\u201d  perception  on \nbehalf of Korean investors. However, it is unclear whether this preferential access to bonds was \nuniquely different from pre-crisis financial flows.  \n\n \nTo determine whether chaebol-affiliated firms\u2019 preferential access to bonds in 1998 was \ndifferent  than  pre-crisis  financial  flows,  we  look  at  the  relation  between  chaebol  affiliation, \ncorporate  governance,  and  lending  in  1996.  Prior  to  the  crisis,  loans  from  financial \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   25 \n\n \n \nintermediaries were the primary means to raise capital in the Republic of Korea. Looking at loan \nflows in 1996, before the onset of the financial crisis, allows us to see whether chaebol-affiliated \nfirms also enjoyed preferential access to capital prior to the crisis. In particular, we now use log \nof gross loan flows before the crisis in 1996 as the dependent variable, and our control variables \nare constructed using data from 1995. These estimates are reported in Table 8.  \n\n \nFirms  affiliated  with  the  largest  chaebols  did  not  appear  to  receive  a  disproportionate \nshare of the loan financing prior to the crisis relative to other firms in the same industry. The top \nfive chaebol dummies are mostly negative in Table 8, and not statistically significant from zero. \nThere  is  only  weak  evidence  that  firms  affiliated  with  the  next  largest  25  chaebols  received  a \nlarger  amount  of  loans  relative  to  other  firms  in  the  same  industry.  This  suggests  that  the \nfinancial  flows  following  the  crisis  were  even  more  concentrated  among  the  chaebol-affiliated \nfirms then financial flows before the crisis.  \n \n\nTable 8: Pre-Crisis Loan Flows, Chaebol Affiliation, and Governance \n \n\nDependent Variable =  \n\nLog(Loan Flows in 1996) \n\n  \nTop 5 Chaebol \n  \nTop 6-30 Chaebol \n  \nLog(Assets) \n  \nDebt/Assets \n  \nOwnership Concentration \n  \nControl-Ownership Difference \n  \nCash Flows/Assets \n  \nCash Volatility \n  \nModified Altman Z-Score \n  \nIndustry Fixed Effects \nObservations \nR-squared \n\n(i)\n0.083 \n(0.290) \n0.450*** \n(0.163) \n1.077*** \n(0.024) \n1.181*** \n(0.134) \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nYes \n4,246 \n0.50 \n\n(ii)\n\u20130.011 \n(0.246) \n0.266 \n(0.192) \n1.127*** \n(0.031) \n1.421*** \n(0.191) \n0.011 \n(0.093) \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nYes \n2,678 \n0.54 \n\n(iii) \n\u20130.027 \n(0.246) \n0.251 \n(0.193) \n1.126*** \n(0.029) \n1.425*** \n(0.191) \n\n  \n  \n0.061 \n(0.100) \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nYes \n2,678 \n0.54 \n\n(iv)\n\u20130.017 \n(0.221) \n0.373** \n(0.166) \n1.106*** \n(0.024) \n1.082*** \n(0.153) \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\u20130.490** \n(0.190) \n0.835*** \n(0.280) \n\u20130.045** \n(0.020) \nYes \n3,923 \n0.53 \n\n* = 10% level, ** = 5% level, *** = 1% level, EBIT = earnings before interest and taxes, KFTC = Korean Fair Trade Commission, \nNICE = National Information Credit Evaluation, OLS = ordinary least squares, RHS = right hand side. \n\nNotes: \n1.

Firms \nentering a top 30 chaebol from 1997\u20132000 and firms that exit a chaebol from 1997\u20131998 are dropped. \n4. Ownership concentration is Joh's sum of personal shareholdings using the largest eight shareholders identified by NICE. \n5. Additional controls included in columns (ii), (iv), and (vi) include Log(Total Assets), Debt/Assets , Cash flows/Assets, Cash \nvolatility, and the modified Altman Z-score \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n \n \n\nIn  1998,  the  coefficient  estimate  for  ownership  concentration  is  positive  and  significant \nindicating  that  firms  with  better  corporate  governance  prior  to  the  crisis  were,  in  fact,  more \nprofitable  on  average  immediately  after  the  crisis.  This  is  striking  given  our  earlier  estimates \nindicate  that  these  firms  with  greater  ownership  concentration  were  no  more  likely  to  issue \nbonds in 1998. In unreported results, we also found a negative correlation between our second \ngovernance measure, the control-ownership rights gap, and ROA in 1998 as we might expect, \nthough  the  estimate  is  not  significant  at  conventional  levels.  In  further  support  that  firms  with \nbetter pre-crisis corporate governance are more likely to make effective use of financing in the \npost-crisis years, ownership concentration remains a strong, positive predictor of ROA in 1999 \nand 2000 as well. \n\n \nThe top five chaebol dummy is also positively related to ROA in 1998, but it is important \nto emphasize that this need not imply that the chaebol-affiliated firms were better able to invest \nfunds  after  the  crises  than  other  firms.  As  noted  earlier  in  the  discussion  of  our  empirical \nstrategy,  post-crisis  performance  measures  after  the  crisis  are  likely  affected  by  access  to \n\n\f \n\nEnding \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d: Government Promises versus Investor Perceptions   \u0406   27 \n\n \n \nfinance.  Firms  with  access  to  the  bond  market  following  the  crisis  may  have  performed  better \nsimply  because  they  could  obtain  credit  when  other  firms  could  not.  In  fact,  the  strong \nperformance of firms affiliated with the top five chaebols in 1998 likely reflects their preferential \naccess  to  bonds  in  that,  ex-post,  we  know  that  these  firms  were  actually  more  likely  to  go \nbankrupt  in  later  years.  Additionally,  we  can  see  that  affiliation  with  a  top  five  chaebol  is  not \npositively related to ROA in 1999 or 2000. This again highlights the importance of our empirical \nstrategy to use industry fixed effects and pre-crisis measures of corporate governance to proxy \nfor firms\u2019 post-crisis ability to invest funds successfully. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nVII. CONCLUSION \n\nOur  evidence  suggests  that  households  in  the  Repulic  of  Korea  were  willing  to  forgo  demand \ndeposits and buy corporate bonds during the Korean banking crisis of 1997\u20131998 because they \nregarded  the  largest  chaebols  as  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  bond  market \nallocated  credit  to  firms  more  likely  to  make  better  use  of  the  funds,  and  there  is  also  no \nevidence  that  default  risk  was  appropriately  priced.  Chaebol-affiliated  firms  issued  larger \namounts  of  bonds  relative  to  other  firms  in  the  same  industry.  Moreover,  the  large  chaebol-\naffiliated  firms  receiving  the  most  bond  financing  in  1998  actually  had  the  worst  corporate \ngovernance prior to crisis and the highest eventual default rates, indicating they would be least \nable  to  invest  the  funds  successfully.  These  chaebol-affiliated  firms  were  also  able  to  issue \nbonds with a lower yield-to-maturity relative to that of other firms, and there is no evidence that \ncorporate governance or other standard measures of default risk were priced by bond investors. \nIn  fact,  firms  affiliated  with  Daewoo,  a  huge  chaebol  that  did  eventually  default,  actually  sold \nbonds  in  1998  at  a  higher  premium  (i.e.,  lower  interest  rate)  than  firms  affiliated  with  other \nchaebols.  \n\n \nThese \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs persisted despite serious efforts of the Government of the \nRepublic  of  Korea  to  credibly  commit  to  not  bailing  out  these  firms.  In  retrospect,  the  market \nbeliefs  were  correct.  When  some  of  the  largest  chaebols  were  unable  to  meet  their  debt \nobligations  in  1999  and  2000,  the  government  undertook  a  large-scale  intervention  to  protect \ncreditors  from  losses\u2015taking  the  view  that  this  was  necessary  in  order  to  prevent  another \nfinancial  crisis.  As  a  result,  the  bond  investors  that  had  invested  in  these  chaebols  largely \nrecouped their investments. The Korean experience suggests that governments may have great \ndifficulty  convincing  investors  that  no  firm  is  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d,  and  that  heavy  regulation  or  the \ndismantling  of  these  firms  may  be  necessary.  It  also  strongly  suggests  that  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d \nproblems are not necessarily limited to the financial firms. \n\n \nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s experience also highlights the ability of large, vested interests to \ncontinue  their  expansion  even  in  the  face  of  a  crisis.  Funding  after  the  Korean  financial  crisis \nwas more concentrated than before the crisis, despite the fact that the crisis was due in part to \nlarge chaebol firms over-expanding based on cheap credit. Smaller firms, even those with better \ncorporate  governance  structures,  were  unable  to  access  the  new  capital  markets  when  banks \nstopped lending. The net effect of the crisis, therefore, was to help large firms relative to small \nfirms.  Economic  power  became  even  more  concentrated  as  a  result,  further  perpetuating \ninvestors\u2019  beliefs  that  the  large  firms  were  \u201ctoo  big  to  fail\u201d.  Rather  than  breaking  the  power  of \nchaebols,  the  immediate  effect  of  the  crisis\u2015at  least  in  terms  of  financial  flows\u2015was  to  help \nfurther the strongest pre-crisis special interests. \n \n\n \n\n\f28   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 314 \n \n \n\nAppendix Table 1: Definition and Source of Variables \n \n\nFinancial Flow Variables \n \n\nGross Bond Flows \n\nGross Equity Flows \n\nGross Loan Flows \n\nNet Bond Flows \n\nNet Equity Flows \n\nNet Loan Flows \n\nOwnership Variables \n \nControl-Ownership Gap \n  \n  \n  \n\nOwnership Concentration \n\nConstructed using the 'cash flows from financing activities' \nsection of the NICE financial data set.

(Ely Lecture \nto the American Economic Association annual meeting in January 2000.) \n\n\fAbout the Paper\nAnalysis of the 1997\u20131999 crisis in the Republic of Korea suggests that despite a \u201cno bailout\u201d \npolicy, chaebols could still issue bonds at prices implying very low expected default risk. The \nevidence suggests that government promises did not eliminate the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d beliefs. \nSubsequent government handling of potential and actual defaults by Daewoo and Hyundai \nconfirmed the market view that creditors would be protected.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite \nthe region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion \npeople who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. \nADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration. \n \nmain instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
