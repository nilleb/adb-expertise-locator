This \npaper  investigates  the  relationship  between  components  of  gross  capital  flows  and  various  financial \nstability  indicators  for  16  emerging  and  newly  industrialized  economies.  Departing  from  panel  data \nmethods,  for  each  financial  stability  proxy,  we  employ  systems  of  seemingly  unrelated  regression \nestimators  to  allow  variation  in  the  estimated  relationship  across  countries,  while  permitting  cross- \nequation  restrictions  to  be  imposed  within  a  country.  The  findings  suggest  that,  after  controlling  for \nmacroeconomic  factors,  there  are  significant  effects  of  different  gross  capital  flow  measures  on  the \nfinancial stability proxies. However, the effects are not homogeneous across our sample economies and \nacross  flows.  Country-specific  financial  and  macroeconomic  characteristics  help  to  explain  some  of \nthese differences. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: emerging economies, financial stability, international capital flows \n \nJEL codes: E44, F41 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nCapital flows are thought of as a mixed blessing for developing and emerging economies. While they \nbring in much-needed foreign capital to supplement domestic finances to support growth and improve \nresilience,  they  also  expose  the  economic  and  financial  systems  to  external  shocks  (Kim  and  Singal \n2000).  Whether  on  balance  the  vulnerability  of  an  economy  increases  or  decreases  with  capital \nmovements remains an open empirical question despite a large body of literature (Kose et al. 2009). For \nexample, the relationship between capital flows and macroeconomic volatility in emerging economies is \nambiguous and may depend on the nature of flows (Hegerty 2011), on the level of financial development \nof the economy (Kose, Prasad, and Terrones 2003), or country characteristics (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille \n2011; and Ahmed and Suardi 2009). \n \n\nIn this paper, we assess the relationship between capital flows and financial stability in emerging \neconomies. By using disaggregated levels of gross capital flows for 16 emerging and newly industrialized \neconomies we investigate their relevance for explaining volatility in multiple financial sector indicators, \nused as proxies for measuring financial stability. \n\n \nThe effect of capital flows on financial stability in emerging markets has gained interest for its \npotential consequences for macroeconomic stability as recent crises have revealed (Erturk 2005; and \nKaminsky  and  Reinhart  1999).  Some  believe  that  financial  liberalization  in  developing  economies \n(domestic  deregulation  and  opening  of  the  capital  account)  is  followed  by  instability  and  crises  for \nreasons such as underdeveloped institutions and banking systems, and an increase in competition and \nrisk-taking as the process of liberalization evolves (Corsetti, Pesenti, and Roubini 1999; and Daniel and \nJones 2007). Others believe that financial openness fosters stronger and more stable financial systems \nowing  to  greater  access  to  capital  (Kaminsky  2005;  and  Kaminsky  and  Schmukler  2008).  Again  the \nevidence is inconclusive. \n\n \nThe literature on financial flows recognizes that unbundling the composite capital account adds \nrichness to the analysis as flows are heterogeneous in nature and possibly in their impact. For example, \nportfolio  debt  and  equity  inflows  are  considered  volatile  because  they  are  driven  by  speculative \nconsiderations. On the other hand, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are considered to be stability \ninducing,  compared  with  portfolio  and  other  investment  flows,  because  they  are  less  prone  to \nfluctuations and reversals in the short term. Conventionally, FDI involves investment in fixed assets in \nan  economy  and  is  driven  by  long-term  considerations.  Hence,  these  flows  are  associated  with \ncontinuity over a period of time. Accordingly, studies find evidence that FDI is the least volatile among \nfinancial flows in general and, particularly, during episodes of sudden stops in crises in developing and \nemerging economies (Wei 2001, Albuquerque 2003, Levchenko and Mauro 2007, and Sula and Willett \n2009). \n\n \nBut  other  studies  show  that  FDI  flows  are  as  volatile  as  other  flows,  and  may  not  always  be \nstabilizing  (Claessens,  Dooley,  and  Warner  1995;  Bird  and  Rajan  2002;  and  Fern\u00e1ndez-Arias  and \nHausmann  2000).  One  reason  is  that  measured  FDI  does  not  reflect  the  \u201ctied  down\u201d  aspects  of \ninvestment alone. Instead, it could represent incoming and outgoing flows that circumvent a country's \ncapital controls and are merely substituting more volatile flows. Or they may be flows that pass through \na particular country to reduce corporate tax liabilities or are used to obtain other funds holding physical \nassets as collateral. These aspects make FDI closer to portfolio debt flows that can fluctuate in the short \nterm (Blanchard and Acalin 2016). Hence, countries have to be cautious about expanding their share of \nthese  flows  without  a  deeper  understanding  of  their  interaction  with  other  flows  and  the  effects  on \nstability (Lehmann, Sayek, and Kang 2004; Wu 2009; and Brukoff and Rother 2007). \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 522 \n\nOn the contrary, portfolio and banking flows are thought of as relatively destabilizing, but some \ncountry-specific cases find that these foreign investments have had a positive effect on stability when \nsupported by appropriate macroeconomic policies (Pruski and Szpunar 2008). \n\n \nThe  presence  of  mixed  evidence  in  the  literature,  often  with  differing  country  experiences, \nsuggests that stability effects of a particular component of capital flow in one country may not be the \nsame for another. Our study contributes to the literature in the following dimensions. First, we begin with \nthe  premise  that  the  relationship  between  flows  and  financial  stability  need  not  be  the  same  across \nemerging market economies (EMEs). So, we explore whether there are significant effects of different \nflows on financial stability in different countries. Given the inconclusive evidence in the literature, we \nrefrain from drawing hypotheses about the sign of the relation in each country and allow the data to \nhighlight  any  significant  positive  and  negative  effects.  The  seemingly  unrelated  regression  (SUR) \nmethod helps to facilitate the approach. For each country, the SUR allows flexibility in the cross-country \nestimated  relationship,  while  permitting  cross-equation  restrictions  to  be  imposed,  as different  flows \nand their effects on financial variables may be related within a country but not across countries. This \nmethodology necessarily departs from previous studies that pool the effects of flows on stability for a \npanel of countries. Using this approach, we find that there are significant linkages between capital flows \nand financial stability proxies, but the effects are not homogeneous in magnitude nor sign across our \nsample economies. \n \n\nSecond,  we  analyze  gross  capital  flows  as  opposed  to  net  flows  that  have  been  used  in  past \nstudies to assess effects on stability. Recent research has stressed the importance of focusing on gross \ncapital  flows,  as  sizable,  positively  correlated  movements  in  both  inward  and  outward  flows  may  be \nmasked by a net figure (Broner et al. 2013, and Pagliari and Hannan 2017). Our results show that, indeed, \ndifferent types and directions of flows have different implications for domestic financial stability. We \nfind that, across the sample economies, there is more evidence that FDI outflows tend to increase the \nvolatility  of  financial  indicators,  while  other  investment  outflows  do  not.  The  effects  of  FDI  inflows, \nportfolio inflows and outflows, and other investment inflows are less clear. \n\n \nThird, we address why the relationship between flows and stability varies across economies. Our \nresults indicate that aggregate macroeconomic and financial characteristics of an economy may explain \nthese  heterogeneous  effects.  While  assessing  the  variation  in  the  magnitude  of  the  relationship,  for \ninstance, in economies with a relatively higher aggregate-credit-to-deposit ratio (which indicates low \nliquidity), all flows, except portfolio inflows, tend to aggravate the volatility of financial indicators. Some \nmacroeconomic variables such as income level, openness to trade, inflation rates, and exchange rate \nregimes determine a pattern in the signs of the estimates. \n\n \nThe  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  II  discusses  our  selection  of  financial \nindicators and describes the capital flows data. It also outlines the empirical methodology used in the \nestimation. Section III provides our empirical findings, and section IV explores possible reasons for the \nresults. Section V discusses their implications and offers concluding remarks. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nDATA AND EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY \n\n \nWe describe the indicators used, data sources, and the estimation technique applied in the empirical \ninvestigation of the relationship between capital flows and financial stability. For the time period 1989\u2013\n2011, three categories of quarterly panel data enter the analysis: a set of financial indicators that will be \nused to measure stability, a set of gross capital flows, and a set of macroeconomic control variables. The \n\n\fCapital Flows and Financial Stability in Emerging Economies   |   3 \n\n16 countries included in the analysis are Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, \nIndia,  Indonesia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,  Mexico,  the  Philippines,  Poland,  South  Africa, \nThailand,  and  Turkey.  These  countries  were  selected  based  on  their  data  availability  for  flows  and \nfinancial indicators. \n \nA. \n \nWe select five key financial indicators to proxy financial stability for their relevance and availability for \nour sample economies from the World Bank's Global Financial Development Database (GFDD): \n \n\nData \n\n(i)  Deposits: Financial system deposits to gross domestic product (GDP) (%), \n(ii)  DomCredit: Domestic credit to private sector (% of GDP), \n(iii)  NetIntMargin: Bank net interest margin (NIM) (%), \n(iv)  NonperfLoan: Bank nonperforming loans to gross loans (%), and \n(v)  LiqAssets: Liquid assets to deposits and short-term funding (%). \n\n \n\nThese aggregate indicators are commonly used to represent features such as size, efficiency, \n\naccessibility, and quality of an economy's financial system. \n \n\nThe  deposits-to-GDP  ratio  is  traditionally  used  as  a  measure  of  size  of  the  financial  system \nrelative to the economy and gives a sense of the extent of financial intermediation, especially through \nbanks. The ratio also serves as an indicator of the availability of access to financial savings in countries \nwhere the financial structure is dominated by the banking system (IMF 2005). \n\n \nThe ratio of domestic credit to the private sector to GDP is another measure of depth of the \nfinancial  sector,  from  the  asset  side  as  it  measures  loans  made  to  the  private  sector  by  financial \ninstitutions.  It  is  also  considered  as  one  of  the  proxies  for  the  level  of  financial  development  of  an \neconomy. \n\n \nIn financial institutions, the NIM is the difference between interest income and interest expense, \nexpressed  as  a  ratio  to  the  amount  of  their  interest-earning  assets.  A  wide  margin  typically  reflects \nfrictions in intermediation; so that a low value of NIM is considered a proxy for higher efficiency. \n\n \nA nonperforming loan (NPL) is one that is in or close to a default. Measured relative to total \ngross loans, this ratio shows the quality of banking sector assets and may indicate weak capitalization of \nthe banking sector. \n\n \nThe last ratio is the percentage of customer deposits and short-term funding that could be met \n\nif suddenly withdrawn. A higher ratio indicates more liquidity and lower vulnerability to a bank run. \n\n \nFor  the  purpose  of  proxying  financial  stability,  we  simply  measure  financial  volatility  as  the \nstandard  deviation  of  the  selected  indicators,  based  on  the  idea  that  a  financial  system  can  be \ncharacterized as stable in the absence of excess volatility. \n\n \nTo  describe  the  capital  flows,  six  measures  of  commonly  used  gross  capital  flows  concept \n\navailable from the International Monetary Fund database are employed \n \n\n(i) \nFDIAbroad: Outward FDI made by country i, \n(ii)  FDIReportCty: Inward FDI received by country i, \n\n \n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 522 \n\n(iii)  PortInvA: Flows of portfolio investments by country i \n(iv)  PortInvL: Flows of portfolio liabilities of country i \n(v)  OtherInvA: Flows of other investments by country i, and \n(vi)  OtherInvL: Flows of other liabilities of country i. \n\n \n\nOther investment assets and other liabilities include trade credit and advances, loans, currency \nand deposits, and insurance and pensions etc. The financial account for country i is defined by the net \nof these six measures plus the change in official reserve assets, which are not considered in this analysis, \nas  they  will  reflect  policy  measures.  In  the  empirical  analysis,  these  six  measures  are  expressed  as \npercentages of nominal GDP. \n \n\nTo control for country specific macroeconomic factors, the following macroeconomic variables \n\nare used in once-lagged form.1 \n \n\n(i)  Real GDP (deviations from stochastic trend via Christiano\u2013Fitzgerald filter), \n(ii)  Exchange rate versus US dollars, end of period, \n(iii)  Net exports as a ratio to nominal GDP, and \n(iv) \n \nThe resulting panel is unbalanced quarterly data from the first quarter of 1989 through the fourth \n\nInflation rate, percent per annum. \n\nEstimation Strategy \n\nquarter of 2011. \n \nB. \n \nWe seek to identify the effects of the components of gross capital flows on a number of financial stability \nproxies in unbalanced panels of cross-country data. In this context, we allow each country to have its \nown coefficient vector and error variance, as there is no reason to believe that the magnitude of these \neffects, or even their signs, may be equal across countries. To this end, we make use of Zellner\u2019s (1962) \nSUR estimator, specifying a separate equation for each country for each of the financial stability proxy \nvariables. While the regression equations may be correlated for a country, they may be uncorrelated \nbetween countries. Unlike more restrictive approaches such as fixed-effects models, the use of SUR \nallows  complete  flexibility  of  the  estimated  relationships,  i.e.,  country-specific  coefficients,  while \nallowing for cross-equation restrictions to be tested and, if warranted, imposed on the equation system. \n \n\nFor  each  individual  observation  of  i  =  1,\u2026,N  (country)  in  the  model,  there  are  M  dependent \n\nvariables (financial indicators), each with its own regression equation \n \n \n \nfor j = 1,\u2026,M.

As  the \nliterature remains inconclusive about the nature of relationship between financial stability and capital \nflows, we refrain from attaching a prior regarding the signs of our estimated coefficients, \t(cid:2010), as they can \ndiffer by country and type of flow.  \n\n \nIn the empirical analysis, we specify two systems of SURs for each of the five measures of financial \nstability: a total of 10 sets of estimates. Each system contains country-specific dependent variables for one \nproxy measure (e.g., the volatility of financial deposits ratio for country i), with country-specific regressors \nrepresenting the six components of gross capital flows and the macroeconomic control variables. The first \nsystem expresses the level of the financial stability proxy in terms of the levels of gross capital flows. The \nsecond system models the volatility of the financial stability proxy as related to the levels of gross capital \nflow.  Volatilities  for  the  financial  stability  proxies  are  computed  from  four-quarter  rolling  standard \ndeviations  of  the  level  measures.  As  the  financial  indicators  are  reported  annually  in  GFDD  the \nproportional Denton interpolation procedure is used to create quarterly series (Baum 2001). \n\nIII. \n\nEMPIRICAL FINDINGS \n\nSummary of Findings for the Levels of Financial Indicators versus Levels of Capital Flows \n\n \nAs each of the 10 estimated SUR systems include up to 96 slope coefficients for the gross capital flow \ncomponents, we summarize our preliminary findings below in terms of the number of significant positive \nand  negative  relationships  detected  in  each  of  the  systems.  There  are  up  to  16  country-specific \ncoefficients for each combination of gross capital flow component and financial stability proxy. Given \nthe unbalanced nature of the panel, some countries\u2019 data do not appear in all the estimated systems. \n \nA. \n \nFor the levels of the financial indicators, Table 1 reports the percentage of coefficients (up to 16) that \nare  significantly  different  from  zero,  at  the  10%  level  of  significance.  Table  2  reports  the  number  of \nsignificant positive relationships detected, while Table 3 reports the corresponding number of significant \nnegative relationships. Table 4 reports the number of net significant relationships, that is, the number of \nsignificant positive relationships minus the number of significant negative relationships. As we can see \nfrom Table 1, many of the levels of financial indicators are seen to be meaningfully related to gross capital \nflows in half or more of the countries studied. \n \n\nFrom  the  results,  we  see  that  larger  outward  FDI  flows  have  a  mixed  effect  on  financial \nindicators, with a large negative impact on NIM and liquid assets. Larger inward FDI flows also have a \nmixed effect overall, with a relatively stronger negative effect on deposits. It appears that most of the \nfinancial indicators are indeed related to gross FDI flows. \n\n \nTurning to portfolio investment, increases in portfolio investment assets and liabilities both have \nclear effects on financial indicators, but mixed across the country sample for assets and relatively more \nnegative for liabilities. Other investment assets have a predominantly positive effect on most financial \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 522 \n\nindicators, whereas the effects are more negative for other investment liabilities, particularly for NPLs. \nWe may conclude that both these categories of gross capital flows have meaningful effects on most \ncountries' financial indicators. \n \n\nTable 1: Levels of Financial Stability Proxies versus Levels of Capital Flows:  \nPercentage of Significant Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\nFDIReportCty \n\n \nDeposits \nDomCredit \nNetIntMargin \nNonperfLoan \nLiqAssets \n\nFDIAbroad \n13 \n29 \n43 \n31 \n57 \n\n50 \n43 \n36 \n56 \n36 \n\nPortInvA \n44 \n29 \n64 \n25 \n57 \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n6 \n36 \n36 \n38 \n14 \n\n44 \n43 \n36 \n56 \n50 \n\n25 \n50 \n50 \n38 \n43 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Levels of Financial Stability Proxies versus Levels of Capital Flows:  \nSignificant Positive Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\n \nDeposits \nDomCredit \nNetIntMargin \nNonperfLoan \nLiqAssets \n\nFDIAbroad \n1 \n1 \n1 \n4 \n2 \n\nFDIReportCty \n2 \n3 \n2 \n5 \n4 \n\nPortInvA \n4 \n1 \n4 \n2 \n5 \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n1 \n4 \n4 \n3 \n1 \n\n1 \n4 \n2 \n0 \n3 \n\n3 \n3 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n \nTable 3: Levels of Financial Stability Proxies versus Levels of Capital Flows:  \nSignificant Negative Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\n \nDeposits \nDomCredit \nNetIntMargin \nNonperfLoan \nLiqAssets \n\nFDIAbroad \n1 \n3 \n5 \n1 \n6 \n\nFDIReportCty \n6 \n3 \n3 \n4 \n1 \n\nPortInvA \n3 \n3 \n5 \n2 \n3 \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n0 \n1 \n1 \n3 \n1 \n\n4 \n3 \n3 \n6 \n3 \n\n3 \n3 \n5 \n6 \n3 \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n \nTable 4: Levels of Financial Stability Proxies versus Levels of Capital Flows:  \nNet Significant Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\n \nDeposits \nDomCredit \nNetIntMargin \nNonperfLoan \nLiqAssets \n\nFDIReportCty \n\nFDIAbroad \n0 \n\u20132 \n\u20134 \n3 \n\u20134 \n\n\u20134 \n0 \n\u20131 \n1 \n3 \n\nPortInvA \n1 \n\u20132 \n\u20131 \n0 \n2 \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n1 \n3 \n3 \n0 \n0 \n\n\u20132 \n1 \n\u20133 \n\u20136 \n0 \n\n\u20131 \n0 \n\u20131 \n\u20133 \n1 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n \n\n\fCapital Flows and Financial Stability in Emerging Economies   |   7 \n\nA Robustness Check with Annual Data \n\nB. \n \nWhen  interpolation  procedures  are  used,  there  is  naturally  a  concern  that  they  may  have  qualitative \neffects on the empirical findings. To investigate this issue, the first set of SUR models (on the levels of \nthe  financial  indicators)  have  been  reestimated  on  the  original  annual  GFDD  data,  with  the  gross \nportfolio flows data aggregated to annual frequency. This necessarily reduces the variability of the gross \nflows data and their explanatory power, and reduces the sample size in the SUR models by a factor of \nfour. On the other hand, employing the response variable in its original form reduces the variation to be \nexplained. \n \n\nTables 5\u20138 may be compared with their counterparts from the quarterly measures, Tables 1\u20134. \nTable 5 illustrates that each of the gross capital flow variables have more prevalent effects on the levels \nof financial stability proxies in the annual data. In Tables 6\u20137, we see that the effects are again mixed for \nthe sample economies for most of the gross capital flow measures. Table 8 reinforces this conclusion. \n\n \nAlthough these results suggest that there is stronger empirical support for our hypotheses in the \nannual data, they should be treated with caution due to the very limited sample size of some of these \nregressions.  Further,  although  it  is  straightforward  to  aggregate  the  gross  capital  flows  to  annual \nmeasures, it is not sensible to compute volatility measures for the financial stability indicators from the \noriginal  annual  data,  as  in  several  cases  it  would  exhaust  the  available  data  to  compute  four-quarter \nmoving  average  standard  deviations.  Therefore,  analysis  of  the  effects  of  gross  capital  flows  on  the \nvolatility  of  the  financial  indicators  can  only  be  performed  on  the  quarterly  interpolated  data.  The \nrobustness checks presented here clearly indicate that we are not manufacturing findings by applying \nthe  interpolation  procedure.  If  anything,  we  are  raising  the  bar  for  detecting  significant  relationships. \nThus, proceeding with the quarterly interpolated data seems to be a sensible strategy. \n \n\nTable 5: Levels of Capital Flows: Percentage of Significant Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\nDeposits  \nDomCredit  \nNetIntMargin  \nNonperfLoan  \nLiqAssets  \n\nFDIAbroad \n50 \n60 \n40 \n56 \n30 \n\nFDIReportCty \n40 \n40 \n60 \n33 \n70 \n\nPortInvA \n60 \n50 \n40 \n44 \n50 \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n60 \n50 \n60 \n44 \n50 \n\n60 \n50 \n20 \n44 \n40 \n\n50 \n50 \n50 \n67 \n50 \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\nTable 6: Levels of Capital Flows: Significant Positive Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\nFDIAbroad \n\nFDIReportCty \n\nPortInvA \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n\nDeposits  \nDomCredit  \nNetIntMargin  \nNonperfLoan  \nLiqAssets  \n\n1 \n3 \n1 \n3 \n0 \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n2 \n1 \n3 \n1 \n4 \n\n2 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n3 \n\n1 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n2 \n\n4 \n3 \n3 \n1 \n3 \n\n4 \n4 \n2 \n0 \n1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 522 \n\nTable 7: Levels of Capital Flows: Significant Negative Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\nDeposits  \nDomCredit  \nNetIntMargin  \nNonperfLoan  \nLiqAssets  \n\nFDIAbroad \n4 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n3 \n\nFDIReportCty \n2 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n3 \n\nPortInvA \n4 \n2 \n2 \n3 \n2 \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n2 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n\n5 \n2 \n0 \n3 \n2 \n\n1 \n1 \n3 \n6 \n4 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n \nTable 8: Levels of Capital Flows: Net Significant Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDeposits  \nDomCredit  \nNetIntMargin  \nNonperfLoan  \nLiqAssets  \n\nFDIAbroad \n\u20133 \n0 \n\u20132 \n1 \n\u20133 \n\nFDIReportCty \n0 \n\u20132 \n0 \n\u20131 \n1 \n\nPortInvA \n\u20132 \n1 \n0 \n\u20132 \n1 \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n2 \n1 \n0 \n\u20132 \n1 \n\n\u20134 \n1 \n2 \n\u20132 \n0 \n\n3 \n3 \n\u20131 \n\u20136 \n\u20133 \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n \nC. \n\nSummary of Findings for the Volatility of Financial Indicators versus the Level of Capital \nFlows \n\n \nThe impact of gross capital flows on financial sector conditions may manifest itself in terms of the levels \nof these proxies, as we have discussed, but it may also have important effects on their volatility. Indeed, \nthere may be more concern about the variability of  these indicators as they are acting as proxies for \nfinancial stability. If there are wide variations in these ratios\u2014for instance, in the NIM earned by the \nbanking sector\u2014that may significantly reduce the stability of the financial sector, and call into question \nthe adequacy of financial intermediaries\u2019 capitalization. Thus, we repeat the estimation for the volatility \nmeasures of the financial indicators rather than their levels. \n \n\nTables 9\u201312 report the results as described earlier. Note that a positive coefficient implies that \nthe capital flow increases the volatility of a financial indicator, and vice versa for a negative coefficient. \n\n \nTable 9 reveals that gross capital flows have significant effects on the volatility of the financial \nindicators  in  most  cases,  with  countries  reporting  significant  relationships  for  many  proxies.  These \neffects may take either sign, as Tables 10\u201312 reveal. For instance, larger outward FDI flows have a net \npositive effect on all the proxies, while the effects of inward FDI flows are mixed. Table 10 reveals that \noutward FDI flows have strong positive effects on volatility of domestic credit, liquid assets, and NPL \nratios for a number of countries, and inward FDI flow on volatility of deposits and domestic credit. \n\n \nPortfolio  investment  flows  have  strong  effects  on  a  number  of  proxies,  but  their  signs  are \nsomewhat mixed. Portfolio investment outflows have a negative effect on domestic credit, and inflows \nhave  negative  effects  on  domestic  credit,  NIM,  and  NPLs.  Both  flows  have  positive  effects  on  liquid \nassets, while other investment asset and liability flows have generally negative effects on the volatility of \nfinancial proxies, except for the latter on liquid assets. \n \n\n\fCapital Flows and Financial Stability in Emerging Economies   |   9 \n\nTable 9: Volatility of Financial Stability Proxies versus Levels of Capital Flows:  \nPercentage of Significant Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\nFDIAbroad \n\nFDIReportCty \n\nPortInvA \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n\n \n\n \n\nDeposits \nDomCredit \nNetIntMargin \nNonperfLoan \nLiqAssets \n\n44 \n50 \n27 \n40 \n53 \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\nDeposits \nDomCredit \nNetIntMargin \nNonperfLoan \nLiqAssets \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\nDeposits \nDomCredit \nNetIntMargin \nNonperfLoan \n\nLiqAssets \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n \n\n \n\nDeposits \nDomCredit \nNetIntMargin \nNonperfLoan \nLiqAssets \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 computation. \n\n4 \n5 \n3 \n5 \n5 \n\n3 \n3 \n1 \n1 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n2 \n2 \n4 \n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTable 10: Volatility of Financial Stability Proxies versus Levels of Capital Flows:  \nSignificant Positive Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\nFDIAbroad \n\nFDIReportCty \n\nPortInvA \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n\nTable 11: Volatility of Financial Stability Proxies versus Levels of Capital Flows:  \nSignificant Negative Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\nFDIAbroad \n\nFDIReportCty \n\nPortInvA \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n\n50 \n44 \n47 \n60 \n60 \n\n4 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n6 \n\n4 \n4 \n4 \n6 \n\n3 \n\n0 \n\u20131 \n\u20131 \n\u20133 \n3 \n\n50 \n38 \n53 \n20 \n27 \n\n4 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n\n4 \n5 \n8 \n3 \n\n3 \n\n0 \n\u20134 \n\u20138 \n\u20133 \n\u20132 \n\n44 \n38 \n13 \n27 \n47 \n\n2 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n5 \n\n5 \n5 \n1 \n3 \n\n2 \n\n\u20133 \n\u20134 \n0 \n\u20132 \n3 \n\n69 \n75 \n53 \n33 \n20 \n\n9 \n5 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n\n2 \n7 \n6 \n3 \n\n1 \n\n7 \n\u20132 \n\u20134 \n\u20131 \n1 \n\n69 \n44 \n47 \n40 \n47 \n\n6 \n2 \n4 \n4 \n5 \n\n5 \n5 \n3 \n2 \n\n2 \n\n1 \n\u20133 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n\n \n\nTable 12: Volatility of Financial Stability Proxies versus Levels of Capital Flows:  \nNet Significant Coefficients \n(up to 16 countries) \n \n\nFDIAbroad \n\nFDIReportCty \n\nPortInvA \n\nPortInvL  OtherInvA  OtherInvL \n\n\f10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 522 \n\nIn  summary,  it  appears  that  capital  flows  have  a  significant  effect  on  volatility  of  financial \nindicators, but the effects are heterogeneous across countries and across flows. When we look at the \noverall  picture  for  the  sample  EMEs,  there  is  strong  evidence  that  higher  FDI  outflows  have  a  larger \npositive effect on volatility and higher other investment outflows have a negative effect on volatility of \nmost of the financial indicators. With FDI inflows, portfolio inflows and outflows, and other investment \ninflows, the results are slightly mixed across financial proxies, with significant effects. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nUNTANGLING THE MIXED EFFECTS \n\n \nDespite the significant linkages between flows and the volatility of financial proxies that capture the state \nof financial stability in the economies under study, our empirical results seem to be in line with previous \nfindings  in  the  literature  on  the  inconclusive  relation.  The  magnitude  and  signs  of  the  statistically \nsignificant coefficients reported in the previous subsection vary across countries. We confront those \nestimated  coefficients  with  several  financial  aggregates  and  macroeconomic  variables  to  look  for \nmeaningful patterns that may shed light on possible reasons behind the cross-country differences. We \nonly explore simple correlations between country-specific characteristics and the estimates from the \nempirical analysis. \n \n\nThe financial aggregates considered here are (i) the relative size of the banking sector in  the \neconomy (represented by the deposit money banks' assets to GDP), (ii) the credit-to-deposit ratio, and \n(iii) the liquid-assets-to-deposit ratio. The macroeconomic variables considered are (i) real GDP per \ncapita, (ii) the degree of trade openness (the sum of exports and imports as a ratio to GDP), (iii) rate of \ninflation, and (iv) the exchange rate regime proxied by the degree of exchange rate volatility. For the first \nthree indicators, we take the median across years as the range is quite large for some economies. For \nexchange rate volatility, we measure the standard deviation of the series. \n \nA. \n \nTo look for plausible patterns in the magnitude of the coefficients, we juxtapose the significant estimates \nagainst financial aggregates and see if an obvious trend emerges. The results are summarized in Table 13. \n \n\nFinancial Aggregates \n\nThe relative size of the banking sector appears to be related with the effect of capital flows on \nfinancial stability. A larger ratio of bank assets to GDP tends to be associated with higher effects of FDI \nand other investment inflows on the volatility of deposits, domestic credit, NIM, and NPLs. Hence, the \neffects on financial volatility of FDI and other investment inflows are stronger in countries with a larger \nbanking sector. Outflows of FDI and other investments, on the other hand, tend to have a weaker effect \non financial volatility as the size of the banking sector increases across countries. The effects of portfolio \nflows on financial volatility are the opposite of those of FDI and other investments, where outflows tend \nto be associated with higher volatility effects in countries with a larger banking sector, and vice versa. \n\n \nWhen compared with the credit-to-deposit ratio, it seems that almost all types of capital flows \ntend  to  aggravate  volatility  of  financial  proxies  as  the  ratio  increases.  The  only  exception  is  portfolio \ninflows, which are associated with lower volatility in countries with a larger credit-to-deposit ratio.2  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  The ratio indicates what percentage of deposits is loaned out by the financial intermediary. A higher ratio indicates lower \n\nliquidity. \n\n\fCapital Flows and Financial Stability in Emerging Economies   |   11 \n\nThe effect of portfolio inflows on financial stability reverses when evaluated at different levels \nof  the  ratio  of  liquid  assets  to  deposits  and  short-term  funding.  Larger  portfolio  inflows  tend  to  be \nassociated  with  greater  financial  volatility  in  countries  with  larger  liquid  assets.  This  also  holds  for \noutflows of FDI and other investments. Other investment inflows and FDI inflows, on the contrary, tend \nto have a smaller effect on volatility in countries with larger liquid assets.  \n\n \nThese  patterns  suggest  that  the  relation  between  gross  capital  flows  and  financial  stability  is \ncomplex  and  far  from  straightforward.  They  also  shed  some  light  on  factors  that  underlie  the \nheterogeneity in the empirical relation between capital flows and financial stability. We further examine \npossible patterns in the signs of the estimated coefficients against macroeconomic variables. \n \nB. \n \nTo further explore reasons why the same type of flow does not necessarily have the same impact on \nfinancial stability in all economies, we also assess whether characteristics particular to the economy can \nexplain the heterogeneity. We compare the magnitude of the coefficient from the estimated relation \nbetween  capital  flows  and  volatility  of  the  financial  proxy  against  an  economy's  macroeconomic \nindicators and report the direction of correlation, if any, in Table 14.3 \n\nMacroeconomic Variables \n\n \nDifferences  in  the  impact  of  portfolio  flows  on  the  volatility  of  different  financial  stability \nmeasures are the ones that appear most consistently when dissected against macroeconomic indicators. \nPortfolio  inflows  tend  to  amplify  the  volatility  of  financial  indicators  more  in  countries  with  higher \nexchange rate variability and higher inflation rates.4 Portfolio outflows dampen financial sector volatility, \non the other hand, in countries with higher income as measured by the real GDP per capita. In short, \nportfolio inflows are found to be more harmful for financial sector stability in emerging countries with \nmore  flexible  exchange  rate  regime  and/or  in  countries  with  higher  inflation  records,  while  portfolio \noutflows are less harmful in higher-income countries. \n\n \nTable 13: Relation between Financial Aggregates and Estimated Coefficients between Flows  \nand All Financial Indicators \n \n\n \n\nPositive Correlation\n\nNegative Correlation \n\nBank assets/gross \ndomestic product \n  \n\nCredit/deposits \n \n  \nLiquid assets/deposits \n \n \n \n  \n\nFDI outflow\nPortfolio outflow\n\nOther investment inflow\nOther investment outflow\nPortfolio outflow\nFDI inflow\nPortfolio inflow\nPortfolio outflow\nOther investment inflow\nOther investment outflow\n\nFDI = foreign direct investment. \nSource:  Based on authors\u2019 computations. \n\nFDI inflow\nPortfolio inflow\nOther investment inflow \nOther investment outflow \nFDI inflow\nFDI outflow\nPortfolio inflow\nFDI outflow\n\n                                                 \n3  We remove any outliers that tend to bias the correlation in a particular direction and also do not report if the correlation is \n\nclose to zero. \n\n4  We use the standard deviation of the exchange rate (period average) of an economy with lower variability pertaining to a \n\nmore fixed-rate regime and higher variability to a more flexible one. \n\n \n\n\f12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 522 \n\nThe effects of other types of flows are not as clear. When seen through differences in exchange \nrate stability, we see some patterns emerge with regard to other flows and volatility of different financial \nproxies. In countries with a relatively fixed-rate regime, the impact of FDI inflows on financial volatility \nis higher than in countries with a relatively floating-rate regime. The result is reversed for FDI outflows \nfor  most  of  the  financial  proxies,  i.e.,  outflows  tend  to  worsen  financial  stability  in  a  more  flexible \nexchange  rate  regime.  Other  investment  flows  tend  to  behave  similarly  as  FDI  flows  with  regard  to \nexchange rate regimes, but the pattern is not as consistent across indicators. \n\n \nAs  we  are  comparing  across  countries,  we  use  median  GDP  per  capita  to  characterize  their \nrelative  performance.  The  estimated  coefficient  between  other  investment  outflows  and  volatility  of \nfinancial proxies reflects a positive relation to GDP per capita, suggesting that outflows worsen financial \nstability in higher-income countries. With regard to inflation, in countries with lower median inflation, \nFDI  outflows  are  associated  with  higher  volatility  of  financial  variables  than  in  countries  with  higher \ninflation. \n \nTrade  openness  is  another  macroeconomic  indicator  that  we  use  to  distinguish  between \ncountries.  Here,  even  portfolio  flows  do  not  show  a  consistent  pattern.  Both  portfolio  inflows  and \noutflows have a higher impact on financial volatility in countries with relatively low openness to trade \nthan in those with more openness. An exception appears for domestic credit, where portfolio inflows \nseem to increase volatility in more open economies. FDI inflows and outflows show the opposite pattern \nfrom portfolio flows, where they tend to increase volatility of financial proxies in more open economies \ncompared with less open ones, except in the case of domestic deposits. \n \n \n\n\fCapital Flows and Financial Stability in Emerging Economies   |   13 \n\nTable 14: Relation between Macroeconomic Aggregates and Estimated Coefficients between Flows and Financial Indicators \n \n\nReal Gross Domestic Product Per \nCapita \n\nTrade Openness \n\nInflation \n\nExchange Rate \n\nPositive \n\nNegative \n\nPositive \n\nNegative \n\nPositive \n\nFDI inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow Other inv inflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nFDI outflow \n\nNegative \nOther inv outflow\n\nPositive \n\nFDI outflow\n\nNegative \nOther inv outflow \n\nOther inv outflow \n\nOther inv inflow \n\nFDI inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nFDI inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nOther inv inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nOther inv inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nFDI outflow \n\nPortfolio outflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nOther inv inflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nFDI inflow\n\nOther inv outflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nFDI inflow \n\nOther inv inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nOther inv outflow \n\nOther inv inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nOther inv inflow \nFDI inflow \nOther inv outflow\nPortfolio inflow \n\nOther inv outflow \n\nFDI inflow \n\nFDI inflow\n\nPortfolio outflow\n\nOther inv outflow\n\nOther inv outflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nOther inv outflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nFDI inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nNonperforming \nloan \n\nFDI outflow \n\nFDI inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nPortfolio outflow\n\nPortfolio outflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nFDI inflow\n\nFDI inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nOther inv inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nOther inv outflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nOther inv inflow\n\nOther inv inflow \n\nFDI outflow\n\nFDI outflow\n\nFDI inflow\n\nOther inv inflow \n\nOther inv inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nPortfolio outflow \n\nOther inv outflow \n\nPortfolio inflow \n\nOther inv inflow \n\nFinancial \nVolatility \nDeposits \n\nDomestic \ncredit \n\nNet interest \nmargin \n\nLiquid assets \n  \n\nFDI = foreign direct investment, inv = investment. \nSource:  Based on authors\u2019 computations. \n\n \n \n \n\n\f14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 522 \n\nV. \n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS \n\n \nIn conclusion, this investigation of the relationship between quarterly gross capital flows and proxies for \nfinancial stability in a cross-country setting reveals that there are significant effects of gross flows\u2019 levels \non  both  the  level  and  volatility  of  the  financial  indicators  after  controlling  for  a  number  of \nmacroeconomic  factors.  Robustness  checks  on  the  level  series  conducted  at  the  annual  frequency \nindicate that the results are not sensitive to the interpolation procedure applied to the financial stability \nproxies. \n \n\nThe results of this study are consistent with the seemingly divergent evidence in the literature \non  the  relationship  between  capital  flows  and  financial  stability.  In  much  of  this  research,  EMEs  are \ntreated as a group due to their similar experiences with regard to movement of flows or are sometimes \npooled into a larger panel with advanced economies to take advantage of cross-country variation in their \nexperience.  As  this  approach  imposes  restrictions  on  the  relationship,  we  use  the  SUR  approach  to \nenable greater flexibility. Our investigation reveals that the effects of capital flows on financial stability \nvary quite substantially across countries and, interestingly, across types of flows. The variation is found \nnot only in terms of magnitude, but also in the estimated signs of the coefficients: the same type of flows \nhave differing effects in different countries. \n\n \nWe  provide  possible  explanations  for  these  variations  by  showing  that  the  differences  in \ncoefficients can be partly explained by the differences in financial and macroeconomic characteristics \nof the economy. The meaningful patterns discussed in our study shed some light on why the effect of \ncapital flows on financial stability may differ across emerging economies, and offer a possible agenda for \nfuture research to more fully understand the nature of the relation between particular capital flows and \nfinancial stability. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nREFERENCES\uf02a \n\n \nAhmed,  Abdulahi  D.,  and  Sandy  Suardi.  2009.  \u201cMacroeconomic  Volatility,  Trade  and  Financial \n\nLiberalization in Africa.\u201d World Development 37 (10): 1623\u201336. \n\n \nAlbuquerque, Rui. 2003. \u201cThe Composition of International Capital Flows: Risk Sharing through Foreign \n\nDirect Investment.\u201d Journal of International Economics 61 (2): 353\u201383. \n\n \nBaum, Christopher F. 2001. \u201cDenton: Stata Module to Interpolate a Quarterly Flow Series from Annual \n\nTotals via Proportional Denton Method.\u201d https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s422501.html \n\n \nBird, Graham, and Ramkishen S.

The paper proposes several country-specific financial and \nmacroeconomic characteristics to help explain these differences.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\nCApitAl FlOwS  \n\nAND FiNANCiAl StABility  \n\niN EmErgiNg ECONOmiES\n\nChristopher F Baum, Madhavi Pundit, and Arief Ramayandi\n\nNO. 522\n\noctober 2017\n\nadb economics\n\nworking paper series\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "ADB Economics Working Paper Series \n", " \n \nCapital Flows and Financial Stability in Emerging Economies \n \n \n \nChristopher F Baum, Madhavi Pundit, \nand Arief Ramayandi \n", " \n", "No. 522   |   October 2017 \n", "Christopher F Baum (baum@bc.edu) is a professor of \nEconomics, Boston College and Research Fellow, DIW \nBerlin.
