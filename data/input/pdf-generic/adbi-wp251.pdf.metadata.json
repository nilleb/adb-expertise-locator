Immediately after its accession to the World Trade \nOrganization in December 2001, the PRC adopted a regional approach to trade and began \nnegotiating and implementing FTAs. This paper analyzes the results of a survey undertaken \nacross 232 Chinese firms with regard to FTA-related issues such as utilization, perceived \ncosts and benefits, perceptions of multiple rules of origin, and policy and institutional support \nmechanisms. It was found that, of the firms surveyed, 45% were using FTAs to some extent. \nWhile this utilization rate appears relatively high, and reflects the assertive stance of Chinese \nfirms when it comes to exploring market opportunities, the actual coverage of export value \nby FTAs is variable. In general, Chinese firms view FTAs as a way to increase their access \nto partner markets. Nevertheless, there remains an orientation toward the United States and \nother traditional markets. However, over time, as rebalancing of growth takes place, there \nmay be a shift in market orientation toward the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) and regional markets and the use of FTAs may intensify. This study offers several \nproposals to increase FTA use, including the expansion of support services for firms, the \npromotion of larger regional FTAs, and the creation of more opportunities for collaboration \nbetween the government and the private sector. \n \n \nJEL Classification: F1, F15, O24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nContents \n \n \n1.

THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\u2019S FREE TRADE \nAGREEMENT STRATEGY  \n1.1  Introduction \nImmediately after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) adopted a regional trade strategy. The PRC has \nconcluded  six  free  trade  agreements  (FTAs)  and  two  closer  economic  partnership \narrangements  (CEPAs)  as  of  the  beginning  of  2010,  namely,  the  ASEAN-PRC  Closer \nEconomic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) (goods and services); the PRC-Pakistan FTA; \nthe PRC-Chile FTA (goods and services); the PRC-New Zealand FTA; the PRC-Singapore \nFTA; the PRC-Peru FTA; the PRC-Hong Kong, China CEPA; and the PRC-Macao CEPA \n(see Table 1 for a summary of the status of PRC trade agreements). Further, the PRC has \n1\nconducted negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council  (GCC), Australia, Iceland, and \nNorway; a Track 1 study on PRC-Costa Rica; and Track 2 studies on PRC-South African \n2\nCustoms Union , PRC-India, and PRC-Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea). With regard to \nthese bilateral FTAs, both developing and developed economy partners come together with \nthe PRC on the basis of mutual interest. The PRC insists that negotiations incorporate \nofficial recognition of its status as a market economy.  \nIn terms of regional agreements, the PRC is a signatory to the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement \n(tariff reduction only, incorporating India, Korea, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic [Lao PDR], and the PRC) and the Greater Mekong Sub-Region Cross-\nBorder Transport Agreement (GMS Agreement), and it has participated in Track 2 studies on \n3\nthe PRC-Japan-Korea (CJK) FTA, the ASEAN+3  FTA (East Asian Free Trade Agreement \n4\n[EAFTA]), and the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia (CEPEA) . \nIn general, the PRC has adopted a gradual approach when negotiating agreements with \ntrading partners: first goods, then services and investment, followed up by a comprehensive \nFTA package subject to the agreement of both parties. The ASEAN-PRC CECA and the \nPRC-Chile FTA were both adopted via this gradual approach. The PRC-Pakistan FTA was \npreceded by an early harvest program (EHP) based on tariff reductions, after which further \nnegotiations around goods and investment took place (Zhang 2009a). In contrast, the PRC-\nNew Zealand, PRC-Singapore, and PRC-Peru FTAs were all comprehensive and single \npackaged agreements (Zhang 2009b). \n                                                 \n1 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. \n2 Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. \n3 Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, \nViet Nam + the PRC, Japan, and Korea. \n4 Amongst ASEAN+6, consisting of ASEAN+3 (see footnote 4) + Australia, New Zealand, and India.  \n1 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nTable 1: The Status of PRC Involvement in FTAs \nStatus  Agreement  Remarks \nAsia-Pacific Trade Agreement  In effect since 1976; PRC acceded in 2001 \n(1976) \nPRC-Thailand PTA (2003)  Early Harvest Program of ASEAN\u2013PRC CECA \nPRC-Hong Kong, China CEPA   \n(2004) \nPRC-Macau, China CEPA (2004)   \nASEAN-PRC CECA (2005)  Framework agreement signed in 2002; TIG \nSigned or In  agreement in effect since 2005; TIS agreement in \nEffect  effect since 2007 \nPRC-Chile FTA (2006)   \nPRC-Pakistan FTA (2007)   \nPRC-New Zealand FTA (2008)   \nPRC-Singapore FTA (2009)   \nPRC-Peru FTA  Signed in 2009; expected to take effect soon \nPRC-GCC FTA (2005)  Framework agreement signed in 2004; under \nnegotiation \nPRC-Australia FTA (2005)   \nUnder \nPRC-Iceland FTA (2006)   \nNegotiation \nPRC-Norway FTA (2007)   \nPRC-Costa Rica FTA (2009)    \nPRC-India FTA (2003)    \nPRC-Japan-Korea FTA (2003)  Investment agreement initiated in 2007 \nEAFTA (ASEAN+3) (2004)  Initiated study in 2004; report completed in 2006 \nPRC-SACU FTA (2004)   \nProposed  PRC-Korea FTA (2005)   \nFTAAP (2006)   \nCEPEA (ASEAN+6) (2007)   \nPRC-Switzerland FTA (2009)    \nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; CECA = comprehensive economic cooperation agreement; CEPA \n= comprehensive economic partnership agreement; CEPEA = Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia; \nEAFTA = East Asian Free Trade Agreement; EFTA = European Free Trade Association; EHP = Early Harvest \nProgram; EPA = economic partnership agreement; FTA = free trade agreement; FTAAP = Free Trade Area of the \nAsia-Pacific; GCC = Gulf Cooperation Council; Korea = Republic of Korea; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; PTA = \npreferential trade agreement; SACU = Southern African Customs Union; TIG = trade in goods; TIS = trade in services \nNote: The PRC-Singapore and PRC-Peru FTAs do not form part of this study as both agreements were concluded \nafter the interviews took place.

However, agreements with developed economy partners, such as the PRC-\nNew Zealand and PRC-Singapore FTAs, extend to incorporate other policy and institutional \nissues, for example, intellectual property rights, transparency measures, quality assurance \nstandards, and competition policy etc. \n2 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \n1.2  The ASEAN-PRC CECA \nThe PRC launched its regional trade strategy with the ASEAN-PRC CECA. This starting \npoint was chosen primarily for pragmatic reasons and reflects an \u201ceasier first\u201d approach. In \nmany ways the ASEAN-PRC CECA was a natural extension of the increasing interest in \ntrade and economic relations shared by the parties. From the PRC\u2019s perspective, an FTA \nwould make it easier for Chinese companies to enter ASEAN markets. Further, an FTA \nwould also serve as a preliminary experiment in the promotion of regional integration and \ncooperation. Politically speaking, the PRC was more confident entering into an FTA with \n5\nASEAN partners than it was with, say, Japan or Korea.   \nIn consideration of the internal differences among ASEAN member states, liberalization has \nbeen undertaken through two separate tracks with different timetables for trade in goods and \ntrade in services (Tables 3 and 4). \nTable 3: ASEAN-PRC CECA for Trade in Goods (entered into force July 2005) \nI.  Principles to be incorporated into agreement: \n(1) EHP \n(2) Tariff reduction: gradual, with timetable, two separate tracks for old and new \nASEAN members \n(3) ROO accumulation, VC 40%a \n(4) Trade dispute settlement \nII.

The services \nliberalization agenda was negotiated one year after the implementation of the \nagreement for trade in goods. However, there were several sectors excluded from \nthis agenda and even within the liberalized sectors many areas remain outside of the \nagreement. \n                                                 \n5 Political gains are also important for the PRC. Since a closer economic relationship helps to smooth the \ncomprehensive relations between partners, this can have a significant effect in creating a surrounding peaceful \nenvironment. \n3 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nTable 4: ASEAN-PRC CECA for Trade in Services  \n(entered into force July 2007) \nI.

The five areas emphasized as priority \nsectors for cooperation are agriculture, information and communications technology, human \nresources development, investment, and the Greater Mekong Sub-Region (GMS). Within \nand  beyond  these  areas,  cooperation  has  taken  place  in  relation  to  banking,  finance, \ntourism,  industry,  transport,  telecommunications,  intellectual  property  rights,  small  and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs), the environment, bio-technology, fisheries, forests and forestry \nproducts, mining, energy, and sub-regional development. Capacity building programs have \nbeen implemented and technical assistance provided, particularly for the newer ASEAN \nmember  states,  to  facilitate  economic  structural  adjustment  and  expand  trade  and \ninvestment  with  the  PRC.  A  profoundly  significant  aspect  of  the  economic  integration \nbetween the PRC and ASEAN has been the establishment of legally-based systems for \ntrade,  investment,  and  management  that  follow  WTO  rules  and  international  standards \n(Banda and Whalley 2005). \n1.3  Future FTA Trends \nThe PRC will continue its efforts to conclude more FTAs into the future. The most likely \nFTAs to be concluded in the near future are the PRC-GCC, PRC-Norway, PRC-Costa Rica, \nand  PRC-Australia  FTAs.  The  region  that  has  the  greatest  significance  for  the  PRC, \nhowever, is East Asia. The PRC has expended great effort in promoting East Asian regional \ncooperation  and  integration.  Economically,  the  PRC  is  a  key  player  in  the  East  Asian \nregional production network and it has benefited remarkably from increased integration and \ncooperation. For this reason, the PRC will continue to initiate and participate in further \nregional arrangements. Apart from the ASEAN-PRC CECA, the PRC also has a strong \n4 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \ninterest in promoting the EAFTA. The primary reason for this is that a substantial amount of \neconomic integration (in the form of a regional production network) already exists among \nEast Asian economies. The PRC is also promoting a PRC-Japan-Korea FTA (also known as \nthe CJK FTA) in northeast Asia (Korea Institute for International Economic Policy 2008). \nThese three economies are among the most integrated in East Asia and have, through \nforeign  direct  investment  (FDI),  created  a  high-level  economic  network  that  facilitates \neconomic exchange in trade, services, and other activities. The PRC is the largest export \nmarket for both Japan and Korea and the largest and second largest market for FDI for \nKorea and Japan respectively. For its part, the PRC believes that a CJK FTA would expand \nits market access to both partner economies. Track 2 studies for the CJK FTA have been \nunderway for several years and indicate that each of the three economies would benefit \nsignificantly from its implementation. While it has been difficult for the three parties to reach \na political consensus, each agrees that an investment agreement should be negotiated first, \nwith a view to establishing a solid foundation for future negotiations around the trade of \n6\ngoods and services as well as further economic cooperation.  \nThe Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) initiative was proposed by the United \nStates during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders\u2019 meeting in 2006. \nAlthough the PRC considers the negotiation of an FTA in such a large region as the Asia-\nPacific to be premature, it has actively participated in APEC activities. \nThere are other factors beyond the interests of the PRC that also have an impact on the \nspeed at which negotiations for new FTAs may proceed. Negotiations may be restrained by \nprospective partners placing less priority on FTAs as an economic development strategy, by \nthe  constraints  of  partners\u2019  domestic  social  pressures  (particularly  with  regard  to  the \nliberalization of their agricultural sectors), and/or by potential partners\u2019 general concerns \nabout the effects of increased competition. \n1.4  The Impact of FTAs on Trade \nFTAs usually promote trade in goods and services and investment by creating an improved \nenvironment for business between the partners (Kawai and Wignajara 2008). For example, \nthe EHP between the PRC and ASEAN helped to increase the volume of agricultural trade \nbetween  signatories.  In  the  case  of  the  PRC-Thailand  EHP,  the  PRC  share  in  Thai \nagricultural exports rose from 8.8% in 2003 to 13.4% in 2006. Trade in goods between PRC \nand ASEAN has increased significantly over the past  decade, with an average annual \ngrowth rate of over 20% since 2000 (Ministry of Commerce of the PRC 2009). However, it is \ndebatable whether the growth since 2005 is entirely attributable to the FTA, given the \nextrinsic  fact  of  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  boom  and  the  increasingly  integrated  regional \nproduction network naturally deriving from increased flows of FDI between the PRC and \nASEAN during that period (Hong 2008). The PRC\u2019s imports from ASEAN have increased at \na faster rate than its exports to the region. In 2009, ASEAN was the third largest import \nmarket for the PRC. Strikingly, \u201chigh tech goods\u201d (mainly electronics parts and automobiles) \naccounted for 53% of the PRC\u2019s imports from ASEAN in 2009. \nEven though the implementation of the FTA may have assisted in the development of the \nregion\u2019s  production  network  (propelled  by  FDI  between  the  PRC  and  ASEAN),  this \nassumption should be made with caution if the only evidence used to support it are post-FTA \ngrowth rates of trade in goods between the PRC and ASEAN. For example, the growth rate \nof trade in goods, although high overall, was lower in 2005\u20132006 (after implementation of the \nFTA) than in 2003\u20132004 (before implementation). \nFTAs may, theoretically, also prompt diversion of trade and investment away from countries \nwith less favorable business conditions. However, these effects are not obvious in the case \n                                                 \n6 Japan seems in no hurry to pursue the CJK FTA and has placed it on its long term agenda. See Zhang and Xu \n(2008) for more information. \n5 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nof  the  ASEAN-PRC,  ASEAN-Japan,  and  ASEAN-Korea  agreements,  in  which  three \nindependent ASEAN-plus FTAs essentially compete with one another. Further, trade and \ninvestment activities among the PRC, Japan, and Korea also seem to have been unaffected \nby the three ASEAN-plus FTAs. The primary element affecting trade and investment among \nASEAN+3  countries  is  their  differently  structured  domestic  markets  and  economies. \nConsidering the large investments coming from Japan and Korea to both ASEAN and the \nPRC, Japan and Korea may actually benefit from the ASEAN-PRC CECA because it creates \na more open market for the existing production network. \nTrade within East Asia is generally dominated by vertically-integrated production. Large \nvolumes of trade and investment in East Asia simply follow the three \u201cASEAN-plus\u201d routes, \ni.e., ASEAN-PRC CECA, ASEAN-Japan CEPA, and ASEAN-Korea CECA. Flows that cross \nthese \u201cASEAN+1\u201d routes are limited (except in the case of PRC-Japan-Korea). In practice, \nthe major factors affecting flows of goods, services, and investment within East Asia are \ngovernment policies (affecting the business policy environment), transportation infrastructure \n(affecting operation costs), and market sizes (affecting final sales volumes). The large trade \nflows  between  ASEAN-PRC,  ASEAN-Japan,  and  ASEAN-Korea  have  not  been  greatly \naffected by the reduction in tariffs brought on by the FTAs, given that tariff rates were \nalready very low\u2014the weighted average tariff rate was less than 5% and there were no \ntariffs for manufacturing parts. Notably, information technology products were also already \ntariff free as a result of the WTO Information Technology Agreement. \nTable 5: Growth Rates of PRC Trade with Major Partners (%, year-on-year) \nTrade Partner  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nASEAN Total  31.1  42.8  35.3  23.1  23.4  25.9 \nExports  22.3  31.1  38.7  29.1  28.8  32.0 \nImports  34.4  51.7  33.1  19.0  19.4  21.0 \nJapan Total  16.2  31.1  25.7  9.9  12.5  13.8 \nExports  7.8  22.7  23.7  14.3  9.1  11.4 \nImports  25.0  38.7  27.3  6.5  15.2  15.8 \nKorea Total  22.8  43.3  42.5  24.3  20.0  19.1 \nExports  23.8  29.4  38.4  26.2  26.8  26.1 \nImports  22.2  51.0  44.3  23.4  16.9  15.6 \nUS Total  20.8  30.0  34.3  24.8  23.9  15.0 \nExports  28.9  32.2  35.1  30.4  25.5  14.4 \nImports  3.9  24.3  31.9  9.1  19.2  17.2 \nEU Total  15.4  44.1  33.9  22.6  26.0  27.0 \nExports  20.3  49.7  38.8  34.1  30.0  29.1 \nImports  10.4  37.7  27.8  5.0  19.1  22.4 \nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; EU = European Union; Korea = Republic of Korea; PRC = \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; US = United States. \nSource: International Monetary Fund (2009), data as of February 2009. \nNevertheless,  the  effects  of  the  rules  of  origin  (ROOs)  attached  to  FTAs  should  be \nconsidered. Under the ASEAN-PRC CECA, a 40% value content (VC) accumulated ROO \nhas  been  adopted  for  most  goods.  However,  with  the  emergence  of  other  FTAs,  the \ncomplexity and added costs associated with ROO documentation could become a problem. \nFor different FTAs, different ROO systems and requirements exist. A single product could be \nrequired to satisfy the different ROO requirements contained in multiple FTAs, depending on \n6 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nthe locations of different production processes. In fact, in the ASEAN-PRC CECA alone, \nthree systems of ROO (i.e., VC, change of tariff classification, and product specific process) \nare adopted (though for most goods the 40% VC system is used). While it is not difficult for \nproducts to meet the requirements of the VC system, the associated documentation is very \ncomplex (Cheong and Cho 2006).  \n2.  ANALYSIS OF SURVEY DATA \n2.1  About the Survey \nIn October\u2013December 2008, a survey of the business community of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) was undertaken in order to investigate the actual and perceived effects of FTAs \non export businesses. Rather than send questionnaires to firms, this survey was conducted \nthrough face-to-face interviews. Based on a pre-interview study of Chinese export firms, 232 \ncompanies were finally selected for this survey. The selected companies range across the \nPRC\u2019s 15 provinces and major cities (see Table 6).  \nTable 6: Locations of Firms Surveyed \nLocation  Number \nShanghai  20 \nTianjin  27 \nGuangdong  30 \nShandong  28 \nZhejiang  15 \nFujian (Xiamen)  20 \nLiaoning (Dalian)  10 \nJiangsu (Nanjing)  10 \nYunnan (Kunming)  10 \nGuangxi (Nanning)  10 \nHenan  12 \nHubei (Wuhan)  10 \nHunan (Changsha)  10 \nShanxi (Xian)  10 \nSichuan  10 \nTotal  232 \nThe selection of companies was based upon three factors: (i) size\u2014including small, medium, \nand large sized firms, (ii) type of ownership\u2014including privately-owned, joint venture, wholly \nforeign-owned, and state-owned firms, and (iii) type of exports\u2014the main products produced \nby the firms for export to FTA partners. The survey questions were formulated to cover five \nmajor  areas:  (i)  general  firm  background,  (ii)  preferences  for  the  use  of  FTAs,  (iii) \nperceptions of the impacts of FTAs, (iv) effects of rules of origin in FTAs, and (v) FTA policy \nissues and institutional support, as well as a further 17 sub-items.  \nThe  remainder  of  this  paper  is  based  upon  an  analysis  of  the  data  gathered  via  the \ninterviews. It is divided into six sections, one for each of the five major question areas \noutlined in the previous paragraph and a final section incorporating concluding statements \nand policy recommendations. Due to the comprehensive coverage of the survey, in terms of \nfirm sizes, locations, and business features, the report provides a rich source of useful \ninformation on the real effects of FTAs and the concerns and needs of the PRC\u2019s business \ncommunity with regard to FTAs. \n7 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \n2.2  Sample Profile \n2.2.1  Sector, Ownership, Firm Size, and Age \nThe  232  firms  that  comprised  the  survey  sample  were  operating  in  five  main  sectors, \nnamely, electronic goods and components, textiles and garments, automobiles and auto \nparts, machinery, and other sectors (see Table 7 for the sector composition and distribution \nof the survey sample by firm size and ownership). \nTable 7: Sample Profile \n  Sector  Size a  Ownership\n   Electronics  Auto  Textiles/ Machinery Other  SME  Large  Giant  Foreign \nGarments\nNumber \nof firms \n45  29  39  55  64  41  90  92  91 \n(n= \n232) \nShare \nof Total  19.6  12.7  16.9  23.5  27.3  18.4  40.4  41.3  39.2 \n(%) \nSME = small and medium enterprise.  \nNotes: Foreign firms are defined as firms with at least 10% foreign equity share.  \nSize is by number of employees: SME = 100 or fewer; large = 101\u20131,000; and giant = more than 1,000. \na Nine Chinese firms did not have data on number of employees. \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data. \nWith regard to type of ownership, foreign-owned enterprises accounted for 39.2% of the \nsurvey  sample  (91  firms)  while  domestic-owned  enterprises  accounted  for  60.8%  (141 \nfirms), amongst which 19.9% were state-owned and 29.0% privately-owned.  \nCalculated according to the number of permanent employees, large enterprises (101\u20131000 \npermanent  employees)  accounted  for  40.4%  of  the  survey  sample,  small  and  medium \nenterprises (100 or fewer permanent employees) for 18.4%, and giant enterprises (more \nthan 1000 permanent employees) for 41.3%. Generally speaking, a larger firm will have both \na higher capacity and more opportunities to export than a smaller firm and, therefore, a \nhigher preference for FTAs. However, in many cases, small and medium firms may have a \nhigher proportion of their products produced for export and enjoy better market access due \nto their specialized business relations with trade partners. Nevertheless, in general, small \nand medium size firms have a smaller comparative advantage in using FTAs.  \nFigure 1 indicates the breakdown of firm size amongst the survey sample as a function of \nthe number of engineers and technicians employed. Of the survey sample, 46.1% of firms \nemployed more than 80 engineers and technicians, 19.4% employed 30\u201380 engineers and \ntechnicians, while 19.4% had fewer than 30 engineers and technicians.

This section analyzes the use of FTAs by PRC firms in two ways. First, it examines \nutilization rates in a direct sense, by calculating the share of firms that use or intend to use \nFTAs. Second, it examines the degree of FTA coverage of firms\u2019 exports, by calculating the \nshare of their total exports that are able to benefit from FTA provisions. \nOf the responding firms, 45% (102 firms) stated that they used at least one FTA and 78% \n(176 firms) said that they used or planned to use FTAs in the future. Such high prospective \nuse figures suggest that Chinese exporters are aggressively considering FTAs as a trade \npolicy strategy. Table 8 summarizes the utilization rates (actual and prospective) of specific \nFTAs in effect, under negotiation, and proposed.  \n14 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nTable 8: Utilization Rates by FTA \n   Use  Plan to Use \nAgreement  Number  Share of  Number  Share of \nof firms  FTA  of firms  respondents, \nusers, % % \n(n = 102) (n = 226) \nSigned or In Effect             \nASEAN-PRC CECA  67  65.7  50  22.1 \nPRC-Hong Kong, China \nCEPA  47  46.1  32  14.2 \nPRC-Chile FTA  33  32.4  28  12.4 \nPRC-Pakistan FTA  22  21.6  31  13.7 \nPRC-New Zealand FTA  15  14.7  37  16.4 \nPRC-Macau, China CEPA  15  14.7  25  11.1 \nUnder Negotiation             \nPRC-Australia FTA    41  18.1 \nPRC-Singapore FTA  25  11.1 \nPRC-GCC FTA  17  7.5 \nPRC-Costa Rica FTA  11  4.9 \nPRC-Iceland FTA  12  5.3 \nProposed             \nPRC-Japan-Korea FTA    39  17.3 \nPRC-SACU FTA  35  15.5 \nPRC-India FTA  33  14.6 \nCEPEA (ASEAN+6)  31  13.7 \nEAFTA (ASEAN+3)  29  12.8 \nPRC-Korea FTA  24  10.6 \nPRC-Peru FTA  20  8.8 \nPRC-Norway FTA  17  7.5 \nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; CECA = comprehensive economic cooperation agreement; CEPA \n= comprehensive economic partnership agreement; CEPEA = Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia; \nEAFTA = East Asian Free Trade Agreement; EFTA = European Free Trade Association; EPA = economic partnership \nagreement; FTA = free trade agreement; FTAAP = Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific; GCC = Gulf Cooperation \nCouncil; Korea = Republic of Korea; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; PTA = preferential trade agreement; SACU = \nSouthern African Customs Union \nNote: Plan to use does not include firms currently using that FTA.

The PRC-Hong Kong, China CEPA had the second highest \nusage rate at 46.1% (47 firms), followed by the PRC-Chile FTA (32.4%). Among prospective \nusers, 22.1% of responding firms anticipated using the ASEAN-PRC CECA in the future; \n16.4% planned to use the PRC-New Zealand FTA; 14.2% planned to use the PRC-Hong \nKong, China CEPA; and 13.7% planned to use the PRC-Pakistan FTA. The importance of \nthe ASEAN-PRC FTA reflects the growing importance of regional markets to PRC exporters \n(Hong 2008). In fact, Hong Kong, China\u2019s importance as a trade center for the PRC may \nsoon be overshadowed by ASEAN, although for small and medium firms Hong Kong, China \n15 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nis still a significant market for exports. The lower numbers of firms that used or planned to \nuse either the PRC-Chile or PRC-Pakistan FTAs may reflect the fact Chile and Pakistan do \nnot constitute significant markets for firms\u2019 exports at this time. \nTable 8 also shows that among the four FTAs under negotiation, 18.1% of responding firms \n(41 firms) planned to use the PRC-Australia FTA and 11.1% (25 firms) planned to use the \nPRC-Singapore FTA.8 The higher proportion of firms planning to use these two particular \nFTAs may reflect the expectation on the part of Chinese firms that they will increase their \nexports to these markets in the future. In contrast, the expected usage rates for the PRC-\nGCC FTA, PRC-Costa Rica FTA, and PRC-Iceland FTA are significantly lower. \nThere are also many proposed FTAs that are under academic or official feasibility study by \nthe PRC and its partners. Of the proposed FTAs, 17.3% of responding firms (39 firms) \nplanned to use the PRC-Japan-Korea FTA, 15.5% (35 firms) planned to use the PRC-SACU \nFTA, 14.6% (33 firms) planned to use the PRC-India FTA, and approximately 13.0% (around \n30 firms) planned to use the two East Asian FTAs. The prospective support for these \nproposed FTAs heralds a growing interest among Chinese firms in the potential of the East \nAsian, Indian, and South African markets for their products, which may increase further as \nthe studies progress. \nWhile utilization rates, as defined by incidence of use, are relatively high among PRC firms, \nthe share of exports covered by FTAs is lower (Figure 9). Of responding firms, 8.8% (12 \nfirms) have FTA coverage for 50% or more of their exports, 11.0% (15 firms) have coverage \nbetween 20% and 50%, 33.1% (45 firms) have coverage for less than 20% of exports, and \nalmost half (64 firms) have no FTA coverage for exports. This variable coverage of export \nvalue  by  FTAs  reflects  the  present  market  orientation  of  PRC  firms  toward  traditional \nmarkets such as the United States. As rebalancing of growth takes place, there may be a \nshift in market orientation toward ASEAN and regional markets and the use of FTAs may \nintensify accordingly. \nFigure 9: FTA Coverage of Exports (% of respondents) \n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nAll firms Transport Food Electronics Small Large Giant\n \nNote: The number of responding firms was 136.  \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data. \n \n2.4  Impediments to Use \nIf FTAs can help firms export, why are utilization rates not higher? Firms face many barriers \nto using FTAs (Table 9). The survey found that the most significant impediment to FTA use, \nas indicated by 45.1% of all firms and 62.9% of non-user firms, was lack of information. \nWhile lack of information appears to be a general problem among firms, it is particularly \nproblematic among firms that do not use FTAs, demonstrating that this information gap \n                                                 \n8 The PRC-Singapore FTA was signed in October 2008. \n16 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \namong Chinese exporters has a significant negative effect on usage rates. The other top \nreasons given for non-usage were time delays in and administrative costs of applying for \ncertificates of origin (COs), small margins between the most-favored nation (MFN) and \npreferential rates, and the use of alternative incentive schemes that give duty-free treatment. \nHowever, the difference in the number of non-user firms versus total firms that consider \ndelays and administrative costs an impediment to FTA use (14.5% of non-users versus \n10.6% of total users) is notable in that it indicates that the process of preparing applications \nfor COs may not be as cumbersome as expected. \nTable 9: Impediments to FTA Use (number of responding firms [% of respondents]) \nImpediments  Non-users only  Total  \nLack of information  78 (62.9)  102 (45.1) \nDelays and administrative costs for COs  18 (14.5)  24 (10.6) \nSmall margin of preference  17 (13.7)  32 (14.2) \nUse of EPZ schemes and/or ITA  15 (12.1)  20 (8.8) \nConfidentiality of information required in CO forms  13 (10.5)  24 (10.6) \nArbitrary classification of origin  8 (6.5)  12 (5.3) \nToo many exclusions  8 (6.5)  10 (4.4) \nNon-tariff measures used by FTA partners  6 (4.8)  14 (6.2) \n        \nNumber of responding firms  124  226 \nCO = Certificate of Origin; EPZ = export processing zone; FTA = free trade agreement; ITA = World Trade \nOrganization Information Technology Agreement \nNote: Multiple answers allowed \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data \n2.5  Costs and Benefits of Selected FTAs \nPositive impacts. Overall, firms experience net benefits from FTAs. More than half of the \nresponding firms identified an increase in export sales as one of the most significant benefits \nof the ASEAN-PRC CECA (Table 10). This demonstrates that Chinese firms are interested \nin market access, i.e., in increasing exports to partner markets. The PRC\u2019s exports are \nembedded in the regional production network, and highly reliant on FDI flows and the \nexternal supply of raw materials and intermediate goods. Accordingly, 89 firms (39.2% of \nresponding firms) also reported greater convenience, 76 firms (33.5%) reported promotion of \nFDI and new business opportunities, and 63 firms (27.8%) cited lower tariffs as important \npositive  effects  of  the  ASEAN-PRC  CECA  on  their  businesses.  The  deepening  of  the \nproduction network and supply chain was cited as a positive effect by 39 firms (17.2%). \nWhile  Chinese  exporters  are  increasingly  connected  to  regional  and  global  production \nnetworks, the majority of Chinese firms are still native producers, manufacturing at the lower \nend of the chain in production networks dominated by very large multinational corporations \n(MNCs). \n17 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nTable 10: Benefits and Costs of Selected FTAs (number of firms [share of responding \nfirms %]) \n   ASEAN- PRC-Chile  PRC- PRC-New \nPRC  FTA  Pakistan  Zealand \nCECA  FTA  FTA \nBenefits             \nCheaper intermediate goods due to \n63 (27.8)  25 (11.0)  17 (7.5)  20 (8.8) \nlower tariffs \nIncrease in export sales   124 (54.6)  43 (18.9)  33 (14.5)  50 (22.0) \nPromotion of FDI and new business \n76 (33.5)  24 (10.6)  24 (10.6)  29 (12.8) \nopportunities \nGreater convenience due to easier \n89 (39.2)  36 (15.9)  36 (15.9)  37 (16.3) \nfacilitation \nDeepening of production network \n39 (17.2)  9 (4.0)  9 (4.0)  14 (6.2) \nand supply chain \nCosts             \nIncreased competition  69 (30.4)  18 (7.9)  16 (7.0)  20 (8.8) \nDocumentation costs and time \n54 (23.8)  27 (11.9)  16 (7.0)  19 (8.4) \ndelays \nDisadvantage with precedent FTAs  18 (7.9)  3 (1.3)  6 (2.6)  6 (2.6) \nRelocation of production  14 (6.2)  5 (2.2)  4 (1.8)  4 (1.8) \nCECA = closer economic cooperation agreement; FTA = free trade agreement \nNote: Multiple responses allowed. The number of responding firms was 227. \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data. \nFor new markets like Chile and New Zealand, the most significant benefits were an increase \nin export sales due to widening market access, cited by 43 firms for the PRC-Chile FTA \n(18.9%) and 50 firms for the PRC-New Zealand FTA (22.0), and greater convenience in \nexporting, cited by 36 firms (15.9%) and 37 firms (16.3%) for each FTA respectively. This \nreflects the fact that Chinese firms, along with promoting a regional focus, still practice a \u201cgo \noutside\u201d policy as a way to take advantage of outside markets, particularly for raw materials \nand  primary  products.  For  the  PRC-Pakistan  FTA,  36  firms  (15.9%)  cited  greater \nconvenience due to easier facilitation as the most significant benefit, and 33 firms (14.5%) \ncited increase in exports sales due to widening market access. Chinese firms may view \nPakistan as an attractive investment location for the purpose of lowering production costs. \nNegative impacts. The most negative impacts of the ASEAN-PRC CECA were increased \ncompetition from imported products cited by 69 firms (30.4%) and documentation and time \ndelays related to FTA use cited by 54 firms (23.8%). Firms\u2019 concerns about increased \ncompetition from ASEAN imports reflect the likelihood that many ASEAN manufacturers \nwould produce similar products to PRC firms within the multinational corporation-created \nregional production network. PRC exporters are also concerned about the complex and \ntime-consuming  procedures  necessary  to  obtain  proper  documentation  for  their  export \nproducts. PRC firms are less concerned about being negatively impacted by relocation of \nproduction  and  competitive  disadvantage  with  precedent  FTAs,  given  the  strong  labor \nmarket and abundance of available capital that continues to ensure their competitiveness.  \nWith the PRC-Chile FTA, documentation costs and time delays and increased competition \nfrom imported products were again the top two perceived negative impacts, with the former \ncited by 27 firms (11.9%) and the latter cited by 18 firms (7.9%). This higher perception of \nthe negative impacts of documentation may reflect the fact that Chile is a geographically \ndistant market and firms may be concerned about time delays affecting export schedules. \nWith the PRC-New Zealand FTA, 20 firms (8.8%) rated increased competition from imported \nproducts as a negative impact and 19 firms (8.4%) were concerned about the negative \nimpact of documentation costs. With regard to the PRC-Pakistan FTA, only 16 firms (7.0%) \nranked increased competition from imported products and documentation costs as negative \n18 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nimpacts, which may allay some concern about competition generated by low-priced products \nmanufactured in Pakistan. \n2.6  Business Responses to FTAs \nGenerally speaking, it is to be expected that once firms have gauged the impacts of FTAs \nthey will adjust their business plans to maximize the benefits of these agreements to their \nbusiness and minimize the costs. The survey results demonstrate, however, that PRC firms \nhave not responded so actively. Only 2.6% of respondents (6 firms) stated that they had \nchanged or planned to change their business plans in response to FTAs (Figure 10). The \nsmall share of definite affirmative responses may imply that FTAs have had limited impact \non firms\u2019 decisions. Still, 31.3% of respondents (71 firms) stated that they may change their \nbusiness plans, reflecting the potential for firms to become more responsive to FTAs in the \nfuture. \nOf the 102 firms that used FTAs, only 3 answered that they have changed or will change \ntheir business plans, whereas 39 firms responded that they may change their business \nplans. In contrast, 46 FTA users indicated that they have not and would not change their \nbusiness plans, while 14 firms responded \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d One of the reasons why the firms \nsurveyed  may  be  reluctant  to  change  their  business  plans  is  that  they  are  still  in  a \ntransitional period of becoming accustomed to FTAs, the details of which remain out of their \ncontrol.  \nFigure 10: Firms\u2019 Business Strategy Responses to FTAs (% of respondents) \n \nNote: The number of responding firms was 227. \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data. \nIn order to understand the reasons behind this general lack of business response to FTAs, \nthe survey investigated the extent to which the firms possessed detailed knowledge of the \nrelevant FTAs. Only 10 firms (4.4% of the 229 responding firms) claimed to have a thorough \nand detailed understanding of FTA provisions (Figure 11). Most of the firms responded that \nthey had not studied the texts at all (24.0% of respondents), that they had limited knowledge \nof FTAs (40.2% of respondents), or that they had knowledge of some aspects of FTA \nprovisions (31.4%). This low level of knowledge of FTA provisions could be the result of \nthree possible conditions: a general lack of interest in FTAs, inadequate FTA training and \noutreach, or the particular corporate officers who responded to the survey lacked knowledge \nof FTAs. The limited knowledge of FTA provisions professed by those surveyed indicates \nthat there is great need for the government to provide additional professional training for the \nbusiness community. \nSMEs, in particular, may have difficulty making full use of FTAs due to their limited human \nresources and level of management training, and so would likely welcome professional \ntraining sponsored by the government or commercial enterprises. Over 60% of responding \nSMEs  professed  to  have  either  no  knowledge  or  limited  knowledge  of  FTAs.  Some \n19 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nknowledge of FTA provisions was professed by 33.7% of responding SMEs and a scant \n3.1% claimed to have detailed knowledge of FTAs.  \nFigure 11: Firms\u2019 Knowledge of FTA Provisions (% of respondents) \n \nNote: The number of responding firms was 229. \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data. \n2.7  Rules of Origin \nRules of origin (ROOs) play an important role in FTA use because all products that could \npotentially benefit from liberalization measures must be able to comply with these rules. \nROOs may create three kinds of problems for businesses: arranging certification of products \nmay be time consuming and costly, differences between ROOs may make transactions more \ncomplex, and different FTAs may result in overlapping ROOs, the so-called \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d \neffect (see Kawai and Wignaraja 2009 for a detailed discussion of the Asian \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d \nphenomenon). \n2.7.1  The Asian \u201cNoodle Bowl\u201d of Overlapping ROOs \nDespite  theoretical  concerns  over  the  \u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d  effect,  only  6.3%  (14  firms)  of \nresponding firms stated that multiple ROOs significantly added to business costs (Figure 12). \nThis  may  reflect  the  extent  to  which  production  processes  requiring  frequent  border \ncrossings are outsourced and, with them, the work of complying with certificate of origin \nrequirements  and  qualifying  for  tariff  concessions.  Such  outsourcing  may  reduce  the \nperceived negative impacts of dealing with multiple ROOs. While it may not be difficult for \nproducts to meet the requirements of the ROO system, the associated documentation may \nstill be very complex (Cheong and Cho 2006). Also, the ambiguity evident in the high \nnumber of \u201cmaybe\u201d and \u201cdo not know\u201d responses to questions regarding the effects of ROOs \non business costs may also indicate that many PRC firms have not yet understood how \noverlapping ROOs could be a significant problem for their businesses.  \n20 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nFigure 12: Firms Perceptions of Impacts of ROOs (% of respondents) \n \nNote: The number of responding firms was 223. \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data. \nWhile multiple ROOs are not perceived to be costly by the surveyed firms overall, the \nreported cost increases among firms that use FTAs. Twelve firms out of the 102 FTA users \n(11.8%) stated that multiple ROOs significantly added to their business costs. When we \ncombine the 11.8% of FTA users that perceive a significant addition to business costs from \nFTAs with the 33.3% who responded that FTAs may impose significant burdens, we see \nnearly half of FTA users perceiving actual or potentially significant costs from the negative \neffects  of  multiple  ROOs,  reflecting  that  there  may  be  greater  costs  in  practice  than \nexpected.  \nFigure 13 offers a breakdown regarding perceptions of the existence of problems with ROOs \nin relation to specific FTAs. Of the total field of respondents, 22 firms indicated that ROO \ncompliance was problematic with the ASEAN-PRC CECA; 8 firms indicated the PRC-New \nZealand FTA; 11 firms perceived problems with the PRC-Hong Kong, China CEPA and the \nASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA); and 10 with the PRC-Chile FTA. Four firms indicated ROO \nproblems with the PRC-Pakistan FTA and two with the PRC-Macao CEPA. Perhaps a larger \nnumber of firms identified ROO problems with the ASEAN-PRC CECA because more firms \nactually use it, as may be the case with the PRC-Hong Kong, China CEPA. The marginal \nperception of problems with the PRC-Pakistan FTA and the PRC-Macao CEPA may be the \nresult of their lower utilization rates. The proportional results across FTAs were very similar \nfor FTA users, although the absolute numbers of FTA users indicating problems with each \nFTA (given that FTA users constitute only 44% of the survey sample) makes it clear that the \nmajority of ROO problems are perceived by those who actually deal with ROOs in practice. \n21 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nFigure 13: ROO Problems for Selected FTAs (number of firms)  \n6\nNew Zealand-China FTA 8\nChina-Pakistan FTA 44\n9\nChina-Chile FTA  10\nASEAN-China FTA 16 22\n7\nAFTA 11\nChina-Macao CEPA  1 2\n4\nChina-Hong Kong CEPA 11\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nTotal FTA users\n \nNote: Firms were able to provide multiple answers.

Asked whether they would benefit from harmonized ROOs, 84 firms \n(38.9% of the 216 responding firms) replied that they would and 79 firms (36.6%) replied that \nthey probably would. With over 70% of firms responding positively to the suggestion of \nharmonization of ROOs, it seems that a single, region-wide, plurilateral ROO regime could \nbe an effective mechanism through which to avoid the costs created by the \u201cnoodle bowl.\u201d9 \nFigure 15: Benefits from Harmonization of ROOs? (% of respondents) \n \n \nNote: The number of responding firms was 216. \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data. \nAsked about their preferences for ROO harmonization, 31 firms replied that they would \nprefer a value-added (VA) based measurement, while 24 firms preferred a change in tariff \nclassification (CTC) rule. A further 41 firms replied that they would prefer the option to \nchoose between a value content (VC) rule and a CTC rule. \nThe preferences of the firms surveyed were distributed relatively equally across the three \npossible rules of VA, CTC, or the option to choose between VC and CTC. This broad \n                                                 \n9 Feasibility studies on the EAFTA (ASEAN+3) and the CEPEA (ASEAN+6) have recommended the creation of a \nregional ROO regime. For the regional production network, a single ROO regime for ASEAN+3 would seem \nmore urgent (Kawai and Wignaraja 2008). \n22 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \ndistribution suggests that PRC firms are still in the process of developing into transnational \ncompanies. This is illustrated when PRC firms are contrasted with Japanese transnational \nfirms, few of which expressed a preference for a VC rule. The absence of a clear preference \namong firms could make the project of harmonizing ROOs more difficult. In recognition of the \nfact that many PRC firms do not thoroughly understand ROOs, it would be beneficial for the \ngovernment to sponsor the creation of an institution that could educate firms about ROOs in \ngeneral, the differences between VA, VC, and CTC, and their respective advantages and \ndisadvantages. \nHowever, 129 firms out of the total survey sample indicated that they would prefer to be able \nto  self-certify  their  own  certificates  of  origin.  This  high  preference  for  self-certification \nindicates that the existing certificate-issuing authority, with its demanding requirements for \ndocumentation, does not fit with the trade environment and is particularly in conflict with just-\nin-time production systems. A self-certification system in which exporters are responsible for \npreparing their own documents would greatly simplify the certification process, enabling \nfirms to save time and money. The government should examine this option in light of the \nhigh number of firms that perceive documentation costs as a negative aspect of FTAs. \nWhen  current  FTA  users  responded  to  the  question  of  self-certification,  59  firms  gave \naffirmative responses and the number of potentially positive attitudes climbs to 80 firms \nwhen the \u201cmaybe\u201d responses are included. Only 16 firms replied that they were against this \nscheme and only 5 FTA-using firms responded \u201cdon't know.\u201d It is difficult to understand why \nthe majority of respondents, whether current FTA users or not, were so unequivocally in \nfavor of self-certification when only 4.3% of firms professed a deep understanding of FTAs. It \nmay simply be that, regardless of any FTA\u2019s rule system specifics, self-certification is seen \nas a time and cost saving measure that could provide welcome relief from cumbersome red \ntape and long delays\u2014which were viewed by firms as a negative impact of FTAs (see \nSection 2.5). \n2.8  FTA Policy Issues and Institutional Support \nInstitutional support for firms using FTAs is important. Two main sources of institutional \nsupport are available to firms when they encounter an FTA-related problem: government \nagencies and non-governmental sources such as business associations. \nThe main government agencies involved in assisting firms with issues regarding FTA usage \nand certificate of origin applications in the PRC are: the Ministry of Commerce (including \nlocal departments of commerce), China Customs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other \nagencies such as the State General Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection, and \nQuarantine. The Ministry of Commerce is directly responsible for negotiating, implementing, \nand monitoring the various regional and bilateral FTAs. Its web site contains important FTA \ninformation including legal texts and instructions for obtaining further assistance. Further, the \nMinistry  of  Commerce  and  the  local  departments  of  commerce  are  responsible  for \nintroducing  FTAs  by  distributing  information  and  organizing  FTA  seminars  and  training \nprograms. China Customs is the agency authorized to issue certificates of origin under \nexisting FTAs and to implement policies on tariff reductions and other non-tariff barrier \nreduction measures. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not deal directly with FTA issues; \nits primary role with regard to FTAs is to provide basic information on negotiations. Other \ngovernmental  agencies  provide  concrete  information  to  help  firms  comply  with  FTA \nprovisions and make full use of concluded FTAs. \nOverall, PRC firms seek support more from governmental and public sources than from \nprivate sector sources such as business associations. When seeking FTA-related assistance \nfrom government agencies, 135 firms would go to the Ministry of Commerce while 114 firms \nindicated China Customs as a source of support. Other government agencies, including the \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, seem to play only a marginal role (used by only 22 firms). These \nfigures indicate that the Ministry of Commerce and China Customs have important roles to \n23 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nplay in helping firms to use FTAs for exports and therefore should strengthen their capacities \nto support the business community\u2019s use of FTAs for exports and the expansion of services \nand FDI flows.  \nNon-government  agencies  are  another  source  of  assistance  for  firms  and  include  the \nChamber  of  Commerce,  other  smaller  business  associations,  law  firms,  and  private \nconsultants. Almost half of the respondents (103 firms) had sought assistance from the \nChamber of Commerce and 22 firms also indicated business associations as a source of \nhelp in dealing with FTA issues, followed by law firms and private consultants (indicated by a \ntotal of 60 firms). \nWhen firms were asked about their knowledge of the specific FTA services provided by \ndifferent  government  agencies,  their  awareness  of  most  services  showed  room  for \nimprovement (Figure 16). Only 52 firms (38.8% of responding firms) were aware of the FTA \ntraining services provided by government agencies and just 33 firms (24.6%) were aware \nthat  government  agencies  offered  FTA-related  business  consulting  services.  A  higher \nnumber of respondents (97 firms or 72.4%) stated that they were aware of government-\nsponsored  web  sites  on  FTAs.  This  high  awareness  rate  of  the  provision  of  online \ninformation regarding FTAs is probably attributable to the convenience that web sites offer \nas sources of information. \nFigure 16: Awareness and Use of Government FTA Services (% of respondents) \n \nNote: Multiple answers allowed. The number of responding firms was 134. \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data. \nWhile online FTA information and resources were the most known among the firms, the \nproportion  of  firms  that  reported  using  these  services  was  much  lower  (54.5%  of \nrespondents). This suggests that firms may desire more interactive information sources from \nthe government or that the information on web sites is not meeting all of firms\u2019 information \nneeds.  The  responses  regarding  business consulting  services  suggest  that  firms  made \naware  of  these  services  are  apt  to  use  them:  while  awareness  of  business  consulting \nservices was the lowest among the services (24.6% of respondents), an equal percentage of \nrespondents reported using these services. \nAwareness of non-government services ranged from 29.1% (39 firms) for consulting services \nto 41.8% (56 firms) for support on the issuance of certificates of origin (Figure 17). Usage \nrates were generally similar to awareness rates, suggesting that when firms are made aware \nof services from non-governmental sources, they are likely to use them. \n24 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nFigure 17: Awareness and Use of Non-Governmental FTA Services (% of respondents) \n \nNote: Multiple answers allowed.

Firms that reported actually using FTAs consistently gave \nhigher ratings for FTA support services than the total survey sample, which includes non-\nusers. The data indicates that there is scope for improvement in the general quality of \nservices provided by government and the private sector. \nTable 11: Quality Assessment of Government and Non-Governmental Services \nFTA Support Services  Quality Level (1-5) \n \nAll respondents  FTA-users only \nGovernment Services:   \n \nTraining  2.4  2.7 \nOnline information  2.8  3.0 \nBusiness consulting services  2.5  2.5 \nNon-Governmental Services:     \nSupport for issuing certificates of origin  3.3  3.5 \nBusiness consulting services  2.8  2.9 \nNote: Rated by firms on a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 is the highest quality.  \n \nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on the survey data.\nConsidering that lack of information was the most significant barrier to FTA use among \nChinese firms, it no surprise that the majority of firms demanded additional services related \nto  the  provision  of  information.

Therefore, the government and the \nprivate sector should devote more resources to providing these services.

CONCLUSION \n3.1  Concluding Points \nFree trade agreements (FTAs) have become an important part of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC\u2019s) trade and economic policies and the PRC plans to take part in more FTAs in \nthe future. This study has analyzed data from interviews undertaken with 232 firms that were \nrandomly selected to cover a range of businesses, representative in terms of size, ownership, \nage, industry, and location. The selected firms were all characterized by high or relatively \nhigh dependence on export markets for their products. \nThe following is a summary of the key findings: \n\u2022  Incidence of FTA use is high and is set to rise. The interviews revealed that \namong the firms surveyed, 45% were already using FTAs to some extent, while \n78% were using or planned to use FTAs. While this utilization rate is relatively high, \nthe coverage of export value by FTAs is not extensive. Use of FTAs, as well as \nintensity of use (determined by export coverage), can be improved by mitigating \nthe barriers to FTA use. The main impediments to use reported by the firms \nsurveyed, in order of impact from highest to lowest, were lack of information on \nFTAs,  small  margin  of  preferences,  confidentiality  of  information  required  in \ncertificate of origin forms, and time delays in and administrative costs of preparing \napplications for certificates of origin. \n\u2022  Firms\u2019  perceptions  of  FTAs\u2019  impact  on  business  were  net  positive.  The \nbenefit reported by the largest number of firms was an increase in export sales due \nto  widening  market  access  followed  by  greater  convenience  due  to  easier \nfacilitation.  The  negative  impacts  most  cited  were  increased  competition  from \nimports and documentation and time delays related to FTA use. The negative \nperceptions  regarding  FTA-related  documentation  indicate  that  firms  remain \nconcerned about red tape issues even after market liberalization. \n\u2022  Firms are considering adjusting business strategies in response to FTAs but \nremain  uninformed  of  the  details  of  provisions. Of the firms surveyed, 77 \nindicated that they had or might change their business plans in response to FTAs. \nWhile firms are considering taking an active stance in responding to FTAs, they still \n26 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nhave limited knowledge of the details of FTA provisions. Only 10 firms claimed to \nhave thorough and detailed knowledge of FTAs. A further 72 firms professed to \nhave some knowledge of FTA provisions. These figures reflect a significant lack of \ninformation available to firms. \n\u2022  Only about 6% of firms definitely consider multiple ROOs to be costly to \nbusiness. Rules of origin (ROOs) have a significant impact on FTA use because \nall products that could benefit from liberalization are required to comply with ROOs. \nIn general, a relatively low number of exporting firms considered multiple ROOs to \nbe problematic, though in practice multiple ROOs may be costlier than expected \nwith nearly 12% of FTA users indicating that they imposed costs and one third of \nfirms responding that ROOs might potentially add to costs. This perceived potential \ncost may be attributed to the fact that firms are still unfamiliar with ROOs in \npractice, especially considering that export coverage by FTAs is relatively low. \nWith regard to proposals for ROO harmonization, there was a fairly even spread of \nfirm  preferences  among  the  options  (value-added  [VA],  change  of  tariff \nclassification [CTC], or a choice between value content [VC] and CTC). However, a \nhigh proportion of respondents indicated their preference for a ROO scheme that \nallowed for self-certification, which could significantly simplify ROO procedures. \nFirms also expressed the hope that government agencies would improve their \ninformation services and ROO certification processes. \n\u2022  Firms want more FTA-related services. Many firms remained unaware of the \nservices provided by government agencies and/or non-government agencies such \nas business associations. This indicates that outreach programs could be more \neffective in informing the business sector of the range of services available. The \nfindings suggest that when firms are aware of these services, they are likely to use \nthem. Among the services desired by PRC firms, FTA-related information services \nwere the most cited. These should be considered of great importance to those \nagencies wishing to promote the use of FTAs. \n3.2  Policy Recommendations \n\u2022  The PRC is a major player in the global trading system. The FTAs concluded \nbetween the PRC and its trading partners thus have a significant impact on both \nthe PRC and the global trading system. As a result, concluded FTAs should be \nconsistent with this system, i.e., with World Trade Organization rules. The gradual \napproach taken by the PRC toward FTAs thus far has been appropriate to its \ncapacities as a developing country. However, as domestic firms continue to grow \nin  regional  and  global  capacity  and  move  toward  becoming  multinational \ncorporations, the PRC should consider establishing more comprehensive package \nagreements that incorporate the liberalization of services and investment. \n\u2022  To address the concerns of firms, more effort should be made to improve the \nassistance available for making the best use of the FTAs signed. Special programs \nand institutions should be developed to provide FTA-related information, training, \nand  consulting  services  for  the  PRC\u2019s  business  community.  The  Ministry  of \nCommerce, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and the \nChina Chamber of International Commerce should conduct more thorough surveys \non  the  impacts  of  FTAs  with  a  special  focus  on  business  responses.  The \ninstitutions most sought out by firms in need of FTA-related assistance were the \nMinistry  of  Commerce  (among  government  agencies)  and  the  Chamber  of \nCommerce  (among  non-government  agencies).  An  electronic  information \nexchange and sharing mechanism should be built by these two bodies in order to \nmaximize the utilization of services provided by both the public and private sectors. \nFinally, market-based service firms should also be encouraged. \n27 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \n\u2022  The multi-layered FTAs that crisscross East Asian markets seem to run counter to \nthe dynamics of the existing production network in which the region\u2019s economies \nare embedded. The ideal solution would be to promote a region-wide FTA in East \nAsia. However, given the difficulty in reaching a consensus among East Asian \ncountries, it would be more practical to promote a facilitation agreement that starts \nwith  a  single  initiative  such  as  the  mutual  recognition  of  standards,  the \nharmonization of ROOs, or the adoption of ROO guidelines in FTA negotiations in \nEast Asia or APEC. \n28 ", "ADBI Working Paper 251    Zhang \n \nREFERENCES \nAsian Development Bank. 2010.
