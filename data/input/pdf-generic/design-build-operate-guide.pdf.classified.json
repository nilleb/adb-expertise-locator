Its mission is to help its developing member countries \nreduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains \nhome to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping \nits developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and \ntechnical\u00a0assistance.\n\n \n\ni\n\nS\nt\na\nn\nd\na\nr\nd\nB\nd\nd\nn\ng\nD\no\nc\nu\nm\ne\nn\nt\n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2019\n\nI\n\nU\nS\nE\nR\nS\nG\nU\nD\nE\nT\nO\nD\nE\nS\nI\nG\nN\n-\nB\nU\nI\nL\nD\n-\nO\nP\nE\nR\nA\nT\nE\nC\nO\nN\nT\nR\nA\nC\nT\nS\nF\nO\nR\nW\nA\nT\nE\nR\nA\nN\nD\nW\nA\nS\nT\nE\nW\nA\nT\nE\nR\nG\nR\nE\nE\nN\nF\nI\nE\nL\nD\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nI\n\nN\nF\nR\nA\nS\nT\nR\nU\nC\nT\nU\nR\nE\nP\nR\nO\nJ\nE\nC\nT\nS\n\n \n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO \nDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE \nCONTRACTS FOR WATER AND \nWASTEWATER GREENFIELD \nINFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\nSTANDARD BIDDING DOCUMENT\n\nJune 2018\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\fUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO  \nDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE  \nCONTRACTS FOR WATER AND \nWASTEWATER GREENFIELD  \nINFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\nSTANDARD BIDDING DOCUMENT\n\nJune 2018\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f Creative Commons   Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 IGO license  \n\n  (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 IGO)\n\n\u00a9 2018 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n\nSome rights reserved.

This guide should be read in conjunction with the relevant Guidance Notes on Procurement published \nby ADB.\n\nThis user\u2019s guide covers the SBD DBO W/WW using a \u201cSingle-Stage: Two-Envelope\u201d or a \u201cTwo-Stage\u201d Bidding \nProcedure. The envelopes are opened in public at the date and time advised in the Bidding Document. The bids are \nevaluated, and following approval by ADB, the Contract is awarded to the Bidder whose Bid has been determined \nto be the lowest evaluated substantially responsive Bid.\n\nThe SBD DBO W/WW documents are available only in electronic format. They must be used for the procurement \nof DBO Contracts in relation with water and wastewater greenfield infrastructure projects, financed in whole or in \npart by ADB, unless ADB agrees to the use of other forms of bidding documents acceptable to ADB.\n\nThe SBD DBO W/WW documents are intended to be used for the procurement of DBO Contracts through open \ncompetitive bidding when\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe contract involves the design, build, and operation of water and/or wastewater greenfield infrastructure; \nand\n\nthe employer wants the plant to meet the purpose of and to reach the performance standards defined \nunder the Contract, and to have a Contractor contractually committed to deliver and operate a fit for purpose \nfacility  under  a  long-term  performance-based  contractual  arrangement  where  the  employer\u2019s  primary \nconcern lies with the achievement of performance objectives by the Contractor. \n\nThe SBD DBO W/WW anticipates that the Contractor is acting as single point of responsibility for the overall \ndesign, build, and operation of the facility, over part of or all of the expected life span of the facility, including all \nnecessary asset replacement during the so-called Operation Service Period.\n\nThe  procedures  and  practices  incorporated  in  the  SBD  DBO  W/WW  have  been  developed  through  best \ninternational  practices  in  this  emerging  arena  (versus  more  traditional  forms  of  contracting  such  as  build-only, \ndesign\u2013build, build\u2013operate\u2013transfer [BOT], or concessions) of DBO Contracts in the water sector, with whole \nlife cycle costs and performance requirements being at the root of such contractual arrangements. Relevant \nBid evaluation mechanisms and contractual machinery have accordingly been developed.\n\nThe  General  Conditions  of  Contract  are  based  on  the  FIDIC  Conditions  of  Contract  for  Design,  Build  and \nOperate  Projects,  2008  (1st  edition)  also  known  as  the  \u201cGold  Book.\u201d  It  assumes  a  greenfield  environment, \nand an Operation service Period of around 20 years. shorter Operation service Periods can nevertheless be \nconsidered, as further explained in this SBD, but the attention of the users is brought to the fact that one of the \nkey strengths of the gold Book, besides performance obligations, lies with the obligation of the Contractor \nto provide for all necessary asset replacement during the Operation service Period, for a price preset in the \nContract\u2014through the Asset replacement fund and schedule. This requires the Contractor to optimize design, \nconstruction, and operation activities to deliver assets, the actual life span of which is optimized, since any early \nasset breakdown would be at the Contractor\u2019s risk and cost. Overly short Operation Service Periods will deprive an \nEmployer of the benefit of this mechanism, if the Operation Service Period is shorter than the life span expectancy \nof the majority of the electrical and mechanical equipment. In such case, the Contract may come to an end before \n\n\f2\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nit can be fully demonstrated whether the assets delivered by the Contractor are robust enough to withstand the \npassing of time and operation.\n\nThe  Employer\u2019s  Representative  is  appointed  by  the  Employer  to  supervise  and  manage  the  Contract  on  behalf \nof  the  Employer,  to  contribute  to  the  successful  completion  of  the  Contract.  When  appointing  the  Employer\u2019s \nRepresentative,  the  Employer  may  either  select  a  reputable  firm  of  consulting  engineers  experienced  in  the \nparticular field, or appoint its own staff, if ADB is satisfied that the Employer has suitable in-house expertise.\n\nThe document foresees the nomination of a Dispute Adjudication Board whose role is to prevent and promptly \nresolve  disputes  which  may  occur  in  between  the  parties  to  the  Contract.  The  costs  of  the  Dispute  Board  are \nshared  equally  by  both  parties.  Arbitration  is  resorted  to  only  if  the  parties  fail  to  settle  a  dispute  through  the \nDispute Board.\n\nThe document also foresees the mobilization of an Auditing Body, being an independent and impartial body in \nbetween the parties, the primary role of which is to verify the parties\u2019 compliance with their obligations during the \nOperation Service Period.\n\nThis guide includes preliminary sections on\n\nthe key features of a DBO Contract, \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe DBO project typology and risk matrix for Water and Wastewater infrastructure, \n\nthe Bidding Process and the way to conduct Bid evaluation, and \n\nthe Invitation for Bids.\n\nADB welcomes any feedback or experiences from both borrowers and bidders on the use of its SBD DBO W/WW. \nFor information on procurement under ADB-financed projects, contact:\n\nProcurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department (PPFD)\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nE-mail: procurement@adb.org\nTel +63 2 632 4444\nFax +63 2 636 2444 [Attn: Director General, PPFD]\nwww.adb.org\n\n\fPart 1\n\nDesign\u2013Build\u2013Operate Contracts for \nWater and Wastewater Greenfield \nInfrastructure\n\n\f4\n\nWhat Are the Key features of  \nDesign\u2013Build\u2013Operate Contracts?\n\nDesign\u2013Build\u2013Operate  (DBO)  contracts  are  long-term,  contractual,  performance-based  arrangements \nbetween an Employer and a Contractor, where the Contractor is to design, build, operate, and maintain a facility, \nto meet performance standards, to carry out asset replacement over its life cycle, or most of it, and to hand back \nthe facility to the Employer upon the contract completion.\n\nDBO  arrangements  are  often  confused  with  other  forms  of  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  projects,  such  as \nbuild\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (BOT)  or  concessions,  but,  as  a  main  difference  with  the  latter,  DBO  projects  do  not \nrequire the Contractor to finance the project nor to bear its commercial risk. financing rests with the employer, \nhence contractual arrangements are shorter and simpler than with BOT or concessions.\n\nAs a difference with more traditional contracting methods, such as build-only or design\u2013build, a DBO contract \nremoves the usual interfaces encountered in the construction industry, in between the D, B, and O phases of a \nfacility: the DBO Contractor acts as a single point of responsibility over all or part of the life cycle of a facility. \nAccordingly, where an Employer, many years after a design\u2013build contract ended, has generally no other easily \navailable recourse than to assume the financial consequences of an asset becoming obsolete earlier than the design \nlife span announced by the design\u2013build Contractor, or of Operating Expenditure (OPEX) becoming much higher \nthan defined at design stage, a DBO arrangement makes the Contractor directly assume such shortcomings\u2014as \nthe contract commits to Operation Service fees and to an Asset Replacement Schedule and associated Fund. Any \nhigher actual OPEX than committed, or earlier than planned asset replacement, is then its full risk.\n\nAs a result, the Employer benefits from a higher and earlier certainty as to the whole life cycle costs of a facility, and \nits performance\u2014the DBO Contractor is contractually bound to meet performance standards and is sanctioned \nby the payment of performance damages if those are not met. DBO arrangements are also praised for allowing \nfaster delivery schedules, due to the absence of D, B, and O interfaces, a higher long-term operational viability, \nand thus better value for money and lower life cycle costs than with traditional sequential contracting over the \nlife span of a facility. Indeed, recent economic research studies tend to demonstrate that DBO is efficient and \nsustainable in economic terms, and with higher economic value potential than design\u2013build or BOT arrangements.\n\n\f5\n\nDesign\u2013Build\u2013Operate Project \ntypology and risk Matrix for Water \nand Wastewater Infrastructure\n\nDesign\u2013Build\u2013Operate Water and Wastewater  \nInfrastructure Project Typology\n\n1. \n\n A simple and straightforward project classification can be drawn up for water and wastewater infrastructure, \nas presented in Table 1.\n\ntable 1: Water and Wastewater Project Classification\n\nClass 1\n\nClass 2\n\nClass 3\n\ngreenfield\n\nBrownfield\n\nTreatment Plant\n\nPumping Station\n(electromechanical works)\n\nCivil Works \n(networks, reservoirs)\n\nWater Supply\n\nWastewater\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\na)\u2002Greenfield versus Brownfield\n\n2. \n\nUnder Class 1:\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u201cGreenfield projects\u201d are those related to a new build facility or infrastructure. For example, a new \nwater  treatment  plant  (WTP)  or  wastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP),  a  new  water  transmission \nmain or pumping stations, etc.\n\n\u201cBrownfield projects\u201d are those where part or all of the facilities are existing facilities to be rehabilitated. \nThose  are  for  instance  frequently  required  for  water  supply  networks,  with  rehabilitation  works \nperformed on an existing network with the underlying objective to reduce the level of nonrevenue \nwater (NRW) and hence to improve the distribution efficiency.\n\n3. \n\n this sBD is suitable for greenfield projects, but is not directly applicable for brownfield projects, for \nthe following reasons:\n\n\u2022\t The SBD is based on the FIDIC Conditions of Contract for Design, Build and Operate Projects, 2008 \n(1st edition) also called the FIDIC \u201cGold Book,\u201d which assumes a greenfield and not a brownfield \nproject.\n\n\f6\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n\u2022\t Brownfield projects require specific provisions to deal with existing facilities/assets which are handed \nover  by  the  Employer  to  the  Contractor  at  contract  inception.  Under  those,  the  Contractor  will \nperform  an  initial  operation  service  period  in  a  first  phase  of  the  Contract,  during  which  they  will \nundertake a diagnostic assessment of the infrastructure, and will define a rehabilitation scope of works \nto achieve the performance standards set in the Contract. Under a second phase of the Contract, \nthey  will  then  implement  such  rehabilitation  works  and  will  continue  operating  the  infrastructure. \nSuch projects require specific contractual mechanisms to deal with matters such as: defects liability \non existing assets (especially latent defects) and relation with performance standards, classification \nof existing assets (in between those accessible and those which are not), replacement/repair liability, \nand operation of existing assets from the outset of the contract execution.\n\n\u2022\t\n\nSuch brownfield provisions are not embedded in the FIDIC Gold Book. FIDIC plans to release in the \nfuture  a  so-called  \u201cBronze  Book,\u201d  which  will  be  an  operate\u2013design\u2013build  (ODB)  form  of  contract \ndesigned to handle the specificities of such brownfield projects. \n\n ADB may develop in the future an SBD for brownfield projects based on that upcoming form of Contract \nfrom  FIDIC.  In  the  meantime,  users  of  this  SBD  should  be  warned  that  using  it  for  brownfield  project \npurposes would require extensive and sensitive amendments to various parts of the Bidding Document, in \nparticular under Section 8 (Particular Conditions of Contract), Section 6 (Employer\u2019s Requirements), and \nSection 4 (Bidding Forms [in particular for Price Schedules and Schedule of Performance Guarantees]).\n\n Users should also note that it is generally neither practical nor realistic to expect an ODB Contractor to \nperform due diligence of existing infrastructure within a short bidding period, and to then contractually \ncommit to reach performance standards and provide for the necessary rehabilitation of such infrastructure \nthat the Contractor never got to design, build, or operate. Status of existing assets is consequently a large \nuncertainty  for  the  Contractor,  hence  a  prominent  risk,  and  a  typical  bidding  period  is  insufficient  to \novercome this matter and reduce the uncertainty down to commercially reasonable levels. Experience \nshows that competent ODB Contractors would tend to walk away from projects where they are not given \na reasonable opportunity to inspect and investigate the infrastructure they are meant to take over, and \nto  endorse  the  rehabilitation  and  performance  risk.  Employers  are  accordingly  encouraged  to  develop \nrealistic expectations, in terms of procurement process, bid submission period, and allocation of risks. \nThis  would  contribute  to  avoiding  situations  where  competent  Contractors  either  walk  away  or  bid  at \nhigh prices to financially cover their risk exposure, and where the Employer may be left to select among \nContractors that are not the most competent and cost-effective, to the detriment of the project.\n\n Contract  solutions  exist  to  handle  the  inherent  specificities  of  ODB/brownfield  projects,  typically  in \nthe  form  of  conditional  contracts,  or  two-stage  contracts  with  partnering  arrangements  between  the \nEmployer  and  the  Contractor  to  align  their  respective  objectives  along  one  common  goal\u2014optimizing \nthe  scope  of  rehabilitation  works,  within  a  set  budget,  to  meet  achievable  performance  standards. \nUsers  interested  to  consider  such  ODB/brownfield  projects  can  contact  ADB  for  further  information \non  partnering  contractual  arrangements,  which  are  of  growing  use  internationally,  and  should  seek  for \nspecialist contractual advice and support when preparing and implementing their ODB project.\n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nB)\u2002Greenfield Projects typology\n\n7. \n\n Development of the Bidding Document, based on this SBD, for DBO/greenfield projects will be based on \nthe features of classes 2 and 3 in Table 1, since they affect the key elements of DBO contracts, i.e.:\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe performance standards defined in Section 6 (Employer\u2019s Requirements); \n\nthe performance guarantees given by the Contractor under Section 4 (Bidding Forms); and\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n7\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe payment mechanism for the design\u2013build period and for the Operation Service Period, as given \nunder Appendix 1 to the Particular Conditions of Contract in Section 8.\n\n8. \n\n The type of treatment (conventional technologies, new technologies, etc.) at stake for a process plant \ndoes not affect the definition of performance standards. Indeed, experience shows that focus is given, \nfor process plants, on defining performance standards based on OPeX features and on compliance \nwith quality standards for the water product, whatever the type of treatment. This is normal since DBO \ncontracts are performance-based forms of contract; hence the Employer\u2019s focus is on the quality of the \nproduct, and on the costs of producing it. The Employer is generally not concerned with intermediary \nproduction stages, or the way to reach the performance standards set in the contract. What matters is the \nultimate results reached by the plant, not the means to deliver them.\n\n9. \n\nTypical performance standards can be defined as follows:\n\n \u00bb Water  quality\u2014treated  water  compliance  with  quality  standards  (pH,  chlorine,  bacteriological \n\n \u00bb Minimum  water  production  outputs  (in  cubic  meter  [m3]/day  [m3/day],  with  daily  and/or \n\nseasonal peak demands to be met, etc.)\n\nPower consumption (per m3 of treated water)/efficiency\n\nChemical consumption (per m3 of treated water)/efficiency\n\n \u00bb Wastewater effluent to the recipient water body\u2014compliance with discharge standards (BOD5, \n\n \u00bb Wastewater treatment capacity (in m3/day, with daily and/or seasonal peak demands to be met, \n\n\u2022\t\n\nFor WTP\n\ncontents, etc.)\n\n\u2022\t\n\nFor WWTP\n\nCOD, SS, etc.)\n\nEtc.\n\netc.)\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\nPower consumption (per m3 of treated water) / efficiency\n\nChemical consumption (per m3 of treated water) / efficiency\n\nBy-products\u2014sludge quantity, sludge dryness contents, etc.\n\n \u00bb Noise and smell/odor nuisance levels\n\n \u00bb\n\nEtc.\n\n\u2022\t\n\nFor pipeline networks (water and wastewater)\n\nContinuity of water supply (24 hours per day)\n\nPressure in the water network\n\n \u00bb Decrease of NRW\n\n \u00bb\n\nResidual chlorine contents in the water network\n\n \u00bb Management of customer\u2019s complaints\n\nLeak repair performance\n\nLevel of silts in wastewater networks\n\n \u00bb Odor management\n\n \u00bb\n\nEtc.\n\n\f8\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nDesign\u2013Build\u2013Operate Water and Wastewater Greenfield \nInfrastructure Projects\u2014Typology of Risks\n\na)\u2002From risk assessment to risk Management in the Construction Industry\n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n Risk  is  the  impact  of  uncertainty  on  objectives,  but  is  also  often  expressed  in  terms  of  a  combination \nof the consequences of an event and the associated likelihood of occurrence of an event.1 Applied to \na  construction  project,  risks  can  typically  be  classified  based  upon  their  possible  timing  of  occurrence  \n(pre-, during, or post-construction phase), and their effect if they eventuate: personal injury or loss of life, \nmaterial damage to the works being constructed or to the property of others, and pure economic and/or \ntime loss for the construction team, for example, when unforeseen physical conditions are encountered \nat site and make the construction operation more onerous than anticipated.2 Construction projects, by \nnature, comprise activities where a wide range of risks may eventuate.3, 4\n\n In contrast with this inherent uncertainty associated to the construction process, society at large expresses \nincreasing demand for health and safety, as well as environmental hazards, to be better controlled and \ncasualties to be limited if not nullified.5 Project parties, and in particular project lenders/financers, require \nan increasing level of certainty on quality, time, and cost of a project and to see corresponding risks on \nthose be minimized.6 Risk inherently exists in construction and cannot be ignored. However, it can be \n\u201cmanaged, minimized, shared, transferred, or accepted,\u201d7 for the better interests of project parties and of \nsociety. \n\n This emphasis does echo a growing culture of risk management, openly and proactively addressing \nrisks  in  construction  operations,  rather  than  keeping  them  hidden  and  liable  to  cause  problems \nwhen they eventuate. This approach started to emerge in the 1980s upon the cornerstone work of \nMax Abrahamson, who defined that a construction party should bear a risk when it can control its \noccurrence, control its effect, transfer it by insurance, and/or have a preponderant economic benefit \nof running it.8\n\n13. \n\n Standard  forms  of  construction  contracts  have  accordingly  over  the  last  decades  increasingly  tried \nto  capture  and  allocate  those  risks,  hence  moving  away  from  an  initial  no-risk  sharing  approach.9  The \nmanagement of construction risks is better achieved by more proactive contractual strategies.10\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n\n4 \n5 \n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n9 \n10 \n\nISO 31000. 2009. p. 1.\nN.

Their Procurement \nProcedures Guide defines that the most beneficial distribution of risks is to allocate each risk to the party \nthat is best able to deal with and handle it.11 FIDIC advocates that\n\na sensible, balanced risk sharing between the contractor and the employer results in the lowest overall total cost \nfor completed projects.12\n\n15. \n\n In  order  to  analyze  the  typical  risks  which  can  affect  a  DBO  project,  ADB  has  based  its  approach  on \nthe  classification  of  risks  on  the  aforementioned  principles  of  risk  allocation  and  management,  as  well \nas on authoritative textbooks in the industry, in particular the one of Nael Bunni, Risk and Insurance in \nConstruction.13\n\n16. \n\n Nael  Bunni  echoes  the  risk  allocation  principles  defined  by  Max  Abrahamson,  which  are  reflected  as \nfollows:\n\nA party should bear a construction risk if:\n\n(a) \n\nIt is in his/her control, i.e., if it comes about it will be due to willful misconduct or lack of reasonable efficiency \nor care; or\n\n(b)  He/she can transfer the risk by insurance and allow for the premium in settling his/her charges to the other \n\nparty.\u2026 and it is most economically beneficial and practical for the risk to be dealt with that way; or\n\n(c)  The preponderant economic benefit of running the risk accrues to him/her; or\n\n(d)  To place the risk on him/her is in the interests of efficiency (which includes planning, incentive, innovation) \n\nand the long-term health of the construction industry on which that depends; or\n\n(e) \n\nIf the risk eventuates, the loss falls on him/her in the first instance, and it is not practicable or there is no \nreason  under  the  above  four  principles  to  cause  expense  and  uncertainty  and  possibly  make  mistakes  in \ntrying to transfer the loss to another.14\n\n17. \n\n The FIDIC Gold Book, which is the standard form of contract used for this SBD for DBO projects, follows \nthese risk allocation principles, under the same allocation spirit as highlighted under para. 14 above and \nwhich are applied across the FIDIC Suite of Contracts.\n\n18. \n\nAccordingly, the typology of risks developed in section B of this chapter:\n\n\u2022\t generally, does not amend the risk allocation principles adopted by the FIDIC Gold Book, since it is not \nthe intention to do so owing to the fact that they are reflecting internationally recognized best practices \n(there are however few limited exceptions which will be developed below); \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nfocuses  primarily  on  risks  which  are  non-insurable,  i.e.,  those  which,  if  they  eventuate,  will  solely \ngenerate an economic and/or time loss for either party; and\n\nfor ease of reference, follows the life cycle of the contract, from its procurement stage, then design, \nbuild, and operation stages.\n\n19. \n\n This is made in the view of optimizing risk management, since those non-insurable risks are typically those \nwhere the risk mitigation measures can be optimized, under a cost\u2013benefit analysis, to determine their \nrelevance in reducing the possible time and/or cost overrun suffered by the project if the risk eventuates. \n\n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n\nFIDIC Procurement Procedures Guide. 2011 (1st edition). p. 35.\nFootnote 11.\nFootnote 2.\nFootnote 2, p. 8.\n\n\f10\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n20. \n\n Indeed,  the  other  risks,  i.e.,  the  insurable  risks,  are  typically  those  which,  if  they  eventuate,  will  cause \nphysical  damage  or  loss,  and/or  personal  injury.  There  are  generic  risk  mitigation  measures  for  those, \nwhich will be of course reflected below but in a summarized manner. As they are generally applied on all \nprojects, this Guide takes the view that they do not necessitate specific elaboration.\n\nB)\u2002Cross-Cutting risks throughout the Whole Contract Life\n\nInsolvency risk\u2014Insolvency of the Contractor\n\nrisk Description\n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n Where will the Contractor be 10 years from now? That question bears particular importance in the frame \nof DBO projects which typically run over many years or even decades. Contracting with a large organisation \ntends to give comfort to Employers under the usual presumption that it is \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. However, such \npresumption has proved to be wrong with the 2008 financial crisis, where even large multinational firms \nwere seen to become insolvent and then liquidated.\n\n Once the Contractor becomes insolvent and enters into a liquidation process, an official receiver assumes \noffice as liquidator and will deal with all creditors of the company being wound up. The Employer would \nthen be one of those in the list of creditors toward which the insolvent Contractor is in debt. There is of \ncourse, in such situations, no guarantee that the Employer will be able to recover all his/her entitlements \nunder the Contract. Typically, an insolvency situation allows the Employer to terminate the DBO contract, \nunder, for example, GCC Subclause 15.2 item (f) of the FIDIC Gold Book under Section 7 of this Bidding \nDocument. The Employer, according to GCC Subclause 15.4(c) will then be able to \n\n\u201crecover from the Contractor any losses and damages incurred by the Employer and any extra costs of completing \nthe  Works,  after  allowing  for  any  sum  due  to  the  Contractor  under  Subclause  15.3  [Valuation  at  Date  of \nTermination for Contractor\u2019s Default]. After recovering any such losses, damages, and extra costs, the Employer \nshall pay any balance to the Contractor.\u201d\n\n In practical terms, assuming a DBO Contract Price of 100, this would mean that if the Contractor becomes \nbankrupt while 60 has been paid to him/her, the Employer can proceed with contract termination. Owing \nto the advance payment repayment mechanism defined under GCC Subclause 14.2, it would have been \nentirely repaid at that time and the corresponding bank guarantee released. The only available financial \ninstrument in hand for the Employer would then be the Performance Security, issued under GCC Subclause \n4.2 from the outset of the Contract. As its value is generally 10% of a Contract Price, we will assume it is \nthe case here and that it is worth 10. \n\n24. \n\n If it later turns out that there are latent defects with the Works as designed and built by the Contractor, \nand that the actual net worth of the Works delivered by the Contractor prior to termination is 40, it would \nmean two things as follows:\n\n\u2022\t The Contractor now has a debt of 20 toward the Employer, but he/she might well not be in the financial \n\nposition to pay that debt anymore owing to the liquidation process.\n\n\u2022\t The Employer would now have to pay at least 60 to complete the DBO Contract, while having only \n40 left in budget. The expression \u201cat least\u201d is to be stressed, since any retendering several years after \nthe initial tendering, may lead to price increase from the market, especially in a situation where a new \n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n11\n\ncontractor would be invited to take over uncompleted works from someone else. Any contractor would \nenter into such arrangement with a high degree of caution as to the quality of the incompleted works \nand the extent they might reliably be incorporated in the works needed to carry out the new contract. \nA high degree of caution would most probably be translated into a higher Contract Price. All in all, any \nretendering for completing the DBO Contract may reveal that the price for completing might well be \nover the 60 value mentioned above.\n\n There is in that case a very high risk that the Employer will incur an extra cost of at least 20 to complete \nthe DBO Contract, while only having 10 in hand which it can call upon through the performance security, \nassuming of course this is a proper on-demand bond and that there are no obstacles in the calling process, \nas it sometimes occurs. Ultimately, there is a very high risk that the Employer is short of at least 10 to \ncomplete the Works, being its financial net loss caused by the Contractor\u2019s insolvency and being impossible \nto recover from the Contractor if it has been liquidated.\n\n Liquidation is indeed often referred to as the corporate equivalent of dying. There is nothing to recover \nfrom a dead entity, and all outstanding debts of the Employer would then be irrecoverable. \n\n The contractual link within the supply chain would also be broken in this case. The Contractor may have \nbeen in contracts with Subcontractors and Suppliers, but those do not have a contractual link with the \nEmployer. The Employer does not then have any direct contractual recourse toward the Subcontractors \nand Suppliers because they do not owe any contractual duty/obligation toward the Employer\u2014they only \nowe such duty/obligation to the Contractor. At the same time, they do not have any recourse toward \nthe Employer (typically for payment of outstanding monies) because the Employer does not owe such \nobligation to them, but to the Contractor\u2014unless the provisions of the governing law give them any such \nright, as it is the case in some jurisdictions where laws on subcontracting do provide a direct payment \nmechanism in between an Employer and a Subcontractor.\n\n As seen from the above, the main risk from the Employer\u2019s perspective is to incur such financial loss which \nmay  not  be  recoverable  from  the  Contractor  if  it  has  been  liquidated  before  paying  his/her  debt,  and \nwithout any remedy toward the rest of the supply chain due to the absence of any contractual open route \nto do so. This risk is further exacerbated with the long-lasting relationship implied by the DBO Contract\u2014\nthe financial situation of the Contractor might be sound at the time of contracting, but unsound several \nyears later.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\nSeveral mitigation measures have been provided for as explained below.\n\n Performance Security requirements have been supplemented by the need for the Contractor to mobilize \na parent company guarantee, under a new Subclause 4.2A introduced under the PCC Part B in Section \n8 of this SBD. Note that the feasibility of having bank guarantees maintained over an extended period \n(several years, and up to 20 years or more), as for more traditional contracts, raises specific concerns in \nthe construction industry as to their practicability and their reasonableness. \n\n Accordingly, the Performance Security regime under the GCC Subclause 4.2 in Section 7 of this SBD has \nbeen amended through the PCC to make the Performance Security requirements last until the end of the \nRetention Period, i.e., one year after the date stated in the Commissioning Certificate (which goes for \nthe acceptance of the Design\u2013Build of the Works as per GCC Subclause 11.7). This was made under the \nrationale that\n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\n30. \n\n31. \n\n\f12\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n35. \n\n36. \n\n\u2022\t There  is  a  Maintenance  Retention  of  5%  deducted  from  the  value  of  each  interim  payment  to  the \n\nContractor over the Operation Service Period, as per GCC Subclause 14.19.\n\n\u2022\t The first half of the Retention Money, which is progressively built up over the Design\u2013Build Period, \nis now (through PCC) released at the end of the Retention Period (1 year after the date stated in the \nCommissioning Certificate), and the second part is released at the end of the Operation Service Period. \nThis differs from the standard GCC provision where the Retention Money was fully released at the end \nof the Retention Period, while it is now only released in half.\n\n\u2022\t As stated above, an additional Subclause (4.2A) under the PCC now requires the Contractor to obtain \n\na parent company guarantee. \n\nIt was found that the above provides for a reasonable amount of security to the Employer.\n\n It was also found that maintaining a security in place over the full life time of the DBO contract, as required \nby GCC Subclause 4.2, might be unnecessary. The FIDIC DBO Contracts Guide indeed states as follows:15\n\n\u201cit is recognized that there are other ways in which to arrange this Security\u2026 some Employers may choose not to \nrequire a Performance Security during the Operation Service Period as they may see this phase of the Contract as \nbeing equivalent to a \u201cservice contract\u201d where a Performance Security is not appropriate\u201d\n\n the Contractor\u2019s financial strength is investigated at qualification stage as laid down under Sections \n3 and 4 of this Bidding Document, through its net worth, being the difference in between his/her assets \nand his/her liabilities, which should be positive over the last recent years. This is a standard practice, as \nrecommended in several authoritative textbooks on construction risks16 and as is already prescribed by \nADB.\n\n This is complemented by the list of ongoing disputes, as developed under Sections 3 and 4 of this SBD \nwith the litigation history, to assess the impact on the bidders\u2019 net worth of those disputes should they all \nbe resolved against the bidder. \n\n In  the  frame  of  a  long-lasting  contract  such  as  a  DBO  contract,  regular  financial  net  worth  checks \nshould be done across the life of the Contract, to give the Employer a contractual recourse, such as \nterminating the Contract in case the Contractor\u2019s net worth becomes negative (say several years after the \nDBO Contract was entered into) to such extent that the Employer is under the reasonable opinion that \nthe Contractor will soon no longer be in the position to assume his/her obligations under the Contract. \nThe FIDIC Gold Book has addressed this matter by introducing a new Subclause (against the 1999 Suite \nof FIDIC Contracts) called \u201cChanges in the Contractor\u2019s Financial Situation\u201d, and being GCC Subclause \n4.25 in Section 7 of this SBD, and which states as follows:\n\n\u201cIf  the  Contractor  becomes  aware  of  any  change  in  the  Contractor\u2019s  financial  situation  which  will  or  could \nadversely affect his/her ability to complete and fulfill all his/her obligations under the Contract, he/she shall \nimmediately give Notice to the Employer with detailed particulars. Within 28 days of receiving such notice, the \nEmployer shall advise the Contractor of what action he/she intends to take and/or what action the Employer \nrequires  the  Contractor  to  take.  In  any  event,  the  Contractor  shall  annually  provide  the  Employer  with  \nhis/her audited financial statements and reports.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nFurthermore, GCC Subclause 15.2, item (e) provides that the Employer shall be entitled to terminate the \nContract if the Employer:\n\n\u201c\u2026in any event reasonably concludes that the Contractor will be unable to complete or fulfill his/her obligations \nunder the Contract due to the Contractor\u2019s financial situation\u201d\n\n15 \n16 \n\nFIDIC DBO Contract Guide. 2011.\nN.

Consultants  are \neither  firms  or  individuals.  They  usually  act  in  the  capacity  of  consulting  engineers,  from  whom  it  is \nexpected the reasonable skill and care of professional engineers when delivering their duties. Their inputs \nare  expected  to  be  delivered  on  the  engineering/technical  side  of  projects.  They  are  not  expected  to \nprovide legal services.\n\n However, sections 7 to 9 of the ADB SBD cover the Conditions of Contract, and Consultants are the ones \nto draft the Particular Conditions of Contract which are found under Section 8 of the SBD. Owing to the \nhigh ranking of the PCC in terms of priority order along which an ambiguity under the Contract will be \ninterpreted (GCC Subclause 1.5), the PCC is a document of high legal impact regarding the rights and the \nobligations of the Parties under, or in connection with, the Contract.\n\n Two main issues are regularly encountered with the drafting of PCC, as follows.\n\n the drafting introduces omissions and ambiguities. The style of the text may depart from the GCC style, \nthe terminology used might be different from the one defined in the Contract (the drafter using \u201chis/her \nown words,\u201d not necessarily applying the Contract defined terminology), or changes are brought to some \nsubclauses without checking whether the related subclauses have been changed accordingly, while the \nContract is to be read and construed as a whole. All this in practice does generate question marks from \nthe Contract users during the contract execution, and the more contract interpretation difficulties are \nencountered, the more disputes are likely to occur. Errors/omissions in contract are a regular source of \ndisputes. This issue has always been recognized by FIDIC, which repeatedly advises construction Parties \nagainst  the  severe  negative  consequences  of  improperly  drafted  PCC.  The  FIDIC  Gold  Book,  in  the \n\u201cParticular Conditions Part B\u2014Special Provisions\u201d section of the Gold Book, states as follows:\n\n \u201cThe tender documents should be prepared by suitably qualified engineers who are familiar with the technical \naspects  of  the  required  works  and  the  particular  requirements  and  contractual  provisions  of  a  DBO  project. \nFurthermore, a review by suitably qualified lawyers may be advisable.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\n the drafting does not reflect mandatory provisions of the governing law, which is generally the law \nof the country where the project is executed. Mandatory provisions of the law are those which cannot \nbe overridden by contract terms, hence which will apply in any case, whatever the contract stipulates. \nThese are also sometimes called \u201cpublic policies provisions\u201d as they are meant to protect the society at \nlarge against what would otherwise be seen as detrimental practices for the sustainable and satisfactory \noperation of a society.\n\n For example, terminating a Contract because an insolvency process started, as provided for in the FIDIC \nGold  Book  Subclause  15.2  item  (f),  is  against  the  law  in  many  civil  law  jurisdictions,  while  perfectly \nacceptable in most common law jurisdictions. Other GCC provisions which are typically affected by the \ngoverning law, when it is the same as the law of the territory where the works are executed, are as follows:\n\n\u2022\t GCC  Subclause  4.4  and  any  Subcontractor  particular  legal  treatment,  such  as  any  right  for  direct \n\npayment from the Employer\n\n\u2022\t GCC Subclauses 4.8, 4.18, and 6.7 regarding Health, Safety, and Environment matters\n\n\u2022\t GCC Clause 6 generally regarding labour laws\n\n\u2022\t GCC Subclause 9.6 and Subclause 10.7 for the payment of delay damages and performance damages\n\n\f14\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n\u2022\t GCC  Clause  12  on  defects,  where  some  jurisdictions  impose  specific  legal  liabilities\u2014typically \n\ndecennial liability on facilities for instance.\n\n\u2022\t GCC Clause 19 on insurance\n\n\u2022\t GCC Subclause 20.1 regarding the 28-day and 42-day time bars on Contractor\u2019s Claims which can be \nchallenged, under some jurisdictions, as being an inequitable obstacle of what would otherwise be a \nlegitimate right to claim.\n\n43. \n\n Beside  the  above,  there  are  also  all  specific  local  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  which  affect  the \nexecution of the works. This will cover the Parties\u2019 obligations as to the obtaining of permits, any specific \ndesign review obligation (from an Authority), any requirements for Tests on Completion, etc.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n44. \n\n The SBD, under Section 6 (Employer\u2019s Requirements), highlights sections of this document which shall \ncontain details as to\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe laws, regulations, codes, and standards applicable to the Contract;\n\nthe permits and licenses to be obtained by the Parties; and\n\nthe applicable health, safety, and environmental requirements.\n\n45. \n\n The  SBD,  under  the  introductory  part  of  the  PCC  Part  B  under  Section  8,  also  states  that  there  shall \nsystematically  be  a  legal  review  done  before  a  Bidding  Document  is  finalized  and  sent  out  to  the \nmarket. This legal review should be done by law firms, or individual lawyers, who are construction lawyers:\n\n\u2022\t Familiar with the General Conditions of Contract\u2014it would be time wasting to mobilize a law firm/\nlawyer who does not know the FIDIC Conditions of Contract in general, and the Gold Book, as well as \ntheir case law and main authoritative textbooks when reviewing PCC developed under the ADB SBD \nfor DBO projects. This, in practice, would only generate additional costs to the Employer (the lawyer \ncharging time for getting familiar with the GCC, and spending time on proposing changes through the \nPCC  which  would  not  be  necessary  owing  to  relevant  sources  of  authority\u2014FIDIC  DBO  Contracts \nGuide, case law, textbooks), and\n\n\u2022\t Experienced with the governing law of the Contract.\n\n46. \n\n A  regular  objection  to  such  legal  reviews  is  the  cost  associated  to  those.  However,  in  the  frame  of \nmultimillion US dollar deals, which, in the specific case of DBO projects, will run for many years if not \ndecades, the cost of such legal risk prevention measure, though limited against the overall DBO contract \nvalue, is outweighed by the benefit of avoiding the suffering from unclear/ambiguous contract terms over \nthe contract life, and to incur costs because of claims and dispute proceedings which could have been \ngreatly avoided by a sound contract drafting.\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n15\n\nDispute risk\u2014Disputes between the Parties\n\nrisk Description\n\n47. \n\n48. \n\n49. \n\n Many countries across the world have, over the last 40 years, progressively recognized the deleterious \neffect of claims, disputes, and litigation upon the efficiency of the construction process, leading to rapidly \nescalating costs for the construction parties, and generating unacceptable losses at the level of the general \neconomy of a country. This has been recognized for instance by the United States in the 1970s,17 by the \nUnited Kingdom in the 1990s,18 and more recently by several other countries: Australia, among others. \nIndeed, in those countries the construction industry was found to be a litigious one, prone to disputes, and \ngenerating average performance and poor overall profitability.19 \n\n Those  countries  have  implemented  various  kinds  of  answers  to  attempt  to  overcome  such  negative \nsituations.  These  are  called  Alternative  Dispute  Resolution  (ADR)  methods,  \u201calternative\u201d  meaning \nalternative to litigation. They work on the basis that although claims and disputes cannot necessarily be \nalways avoidable, their protracted resolution can be avoided. Typically, when claims escalate into disputes \nin construction contracts, and do not get promptly resolved, there is a significant risk \u2013 the dispute risk \u2013 \nthat the relationship between the parties progressively falls apart to such extent that the whole contract \nbecomes jeopardized. Indeed, litigation proceedings are known to last several years and to be highly costly \nto the Parties, in particular due to legal fees and expert witness\u2019 fees. It is consequently in the interest \nof the global economy in general, and of the construction contract parties in particular, to have at their \ndisposal fast-track and efficient dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n DBO contracts are particularly sensitive to this dispute risk, owing to their long-term nature. It would be \nhighly detrimental for the project to leave the relationship between the Parties to fall apart because claims \nand disputes are not promptly addressed and resolved. Since the Parties will have \u201cto live with each other \nfor many years\u201d, it would not be satisfactory to run the risk of seeing acrimonious, posturing, opportunistic \nand/or adversarial behaviors developing over the contract implementation period.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n50. \n\n The dispute resolution mechanism foreseen by FIDIC, i.e., the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB), has \nbeen fully reflected under the Bidding Document. The FIDIC Gold Book provides that the DAB is to be \nmobilized from the outset of the Contract execution to be able to deliver its dual function:\n\n\u2022\t Dispute avoidance\u2014by providing informal assistance to the Parties, at their joint request during the \n\ncontract implementation, to assist the Parties in resolving any disagreement they may have.\n\n\u2022\t Prompt dispute resolution\u2014deciding on a dispute formally referred to the DAB, within 84 days from \n\nthe date the DAB receives the respondent\u2019s submission.\n\n51. \n\n It is indeed unfortunately very frequent for DABs not to be mobilized from the outset of the Contract, \ndespite  express  contract  terms  requiring  such  early  mobilization.  This  is  generally  explained  by  several \nreasons, such as\n\n17 \n\n18 \n19 \n\nDispute Review Board Foundation. 2007. DRBF Practices and Procedures Manual.

It  is  then  a \n\n(b)  Any act or omission of the Employer, or the necessary result of the construction of the Works as \n\nContractor\u2019s risk;  \n\ndefined in the Contract; or\n\n(c)  Occurrence  of  Exceptional  Risks\u2014these  are  risks  which  are  external  to  the  Parties,  beyond  their \ncontrol  and  which  they  cannot  overcome.  Those  exceptional  risks  were  named  \u201cForce  Majeure\u201d \nrisk events in the 1999 FIDIC Suite of Contracts and are also known as such in many jurisdictions. \nTypically, these are war, riots, civil unrest, natural catastrophes, etc.\n\n55. \n\n56. \n\n Under cause (a) above, the Contractor would fully bear the risk under the provisions of the Gold Book\u2014\nsee Section 7 GCC Subclause 17.2 and 17.4  but would benefit from insurance cover for this under GCC \nSubclause 19.2\u2014typically a Professional Indemnity (PI) for risk stemming from his/her design, and/or \nthe equivalent of a Contractor\u2019s All Risk (CAR) insurance.\n\n Under causes (b) and (c) above, the Employer would bear the risk as per GCC Subclause 17.1. Cause (b) \nis categorized, under the Gold Book, either as a \u201cCommercial Risk\u201d or as \u201cEmployer\u2019s Risk of Damage\u201d, \nwhile cause (c) falls under the \u201cEmployer\u2019s Risks of Damage\u201d category. These are defined as follows:\n\n\u2022\t Under GCC Subclause 1.1.7: \u201cCommercial Risk\u201d means a risk which results in financial loss and/or time \n\nloss for either of the Parties, where insurance is not generally or commercially available.\n\n\u2022\t Under GCC Subclause 1.1.67: \u201cRisk of Damage\u201d means a risk which results in physical loss or damage to \n\nthe Works or other property belonging to either Party, other than a Commercial Risk.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n57. \n\nAs to the risk under cause (a) above:\n\n\u2022\t The main risk mitigation in the frame of a DBO project is the one generally already in place in all ADB \nbidding processes. It consists of the qualification of bidders, to verify that the Contractor who will be \nselected has the necessary skills, resources, and experience to undertake the works. Users can then \nrefer to sections 3 and 4 under this SBD.\n\n\u2022\t Another risk mitigation lies with the emphasis which the Employer can put on Health and Safety at work \nthrough the Employer\u2019s Requirements. Section 6 of this SBD specifically requires that such matters are \ncovered in the Employer\u2019s Requirements.\n\nThis will not of course eliminate all risks, as there is no such thing as \u201czero risk\u201d no matter how competent \nand  experienced  the  Contractor  may  be,  but  this  does  contribute  to  reduce  the  risk,  and  any  residual \noccurrence would be covered by the Contractor\u2019s insurances.\n\n58. \n\n As to the risk under cause (b) above, its occurrence is limited in the frame of a DBO project since the \nEmployer is not meant to come and operate any parts of the Works during the execution of the Contract, \nsince operation responsibility lies with the Contractor. There is accordingly little risk of having issues with \nthe use or occupation of the Site or the Works by the Employer. And if the risk eventuates and causes \n\n\f18\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n59. \n\n60. \n\n61. \n\nloss, damage, or injury to third parties, this would typically be covered by the insurances defined under the \nContract. If it is damage caused to the Works (for instance, Employer\u2019s personnel causing inadvertently a \ndamage to the Works during an inspection), the Contractor will be instructed to proceed with the repair \nunder GCC Subclause 17.6 but this will then be dealt with as a Variation.\n\n The main mitigation measure for this risk is the compliance by the Employer\u2019s personnel with health and \nsafety rules at the site, and the mobilization of professional specialized personnel to assist the Employer \n(for example, a consulting engineer acting as Employer\u2019s Representative) for tasks falling outside his/her \nscope of skills and competencies. \n\n As to the risk under cause (c), this is typically the most complicated to handle since Exceptional Risks are \nby definition (under GCC 1.1.37 for Exceptional Events) those stemming from events that the Parties \ncannot overcome if it occurs and which the Parties could not have provided against before entering into \nthe contract. However, natural catastrophe risks are assessed in terms of likelihood of occurrence. There \nare  general  risk  assessment  maps  available,  produced  by  a  national  institute,  and  identifying  for  each \nlocation in a country the risks of flood, typhoons, earthquakes, etc. \n\n Since executing a project in an area which is subject to such Exceptional Risks, which are rare but severe, \nthreatens the root of the project, it is recommended in that case to liaise with the local insurance industry \nof the country to see what coverage could be obtained if any of those risks listed under GCC Clause 18 \neventuates. Where the risk is not insurable, it would be down to the Employer to decide whether he/she \nwants to maintain the project in that particular location since, if he/she does, he/she would bear, out of \nhis/her own resources, the consequences of any non-insurable Exceptional Risk eventuating.\n\n62. \n\n Note  that  this  SBD  specifically  addresses  insurance  matters,  owing  to  their  criticality  on  construction \nprojects in general and under DBO arrangements in particular. A specific Appendix in this respect has \nbeen developed to the PCC under Section 8 of the SBD, and the insurance risk is further analyzed below.\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n19\n\nInsurances\n\nrisk Description\n\n63. \n\n64. \n\n65. \n\n66. \n\n67. \n\n68. \n\n Knowing which risks are insurable, and at which conditions, is key to fine-tune and finalize a risk assessment. \nAlong the principles of risk allocation, defined by Max Abrahamson and Nael Bunni as highlighted under \npara. 16 above, one of the criteria for deciding to allocate a risk to a Party is its capacity to insure a risk.\n\n As mentioned above, most of the construction risks which are highlighted in this chapter are non-insurable \nrisks, also called \u201cCommercial Risk\u201d by FIDIC under the Gold Book in Section 7 of this SBD, and are of \nthose for which the mitigation measures highlighted in this chapter are key to reduce their cost and time \nimpact. \n\n The other risks, i.e., the insurable risks (loss/damage caused to or by third parties, professional negligence, \netc.) are potentially less of an issue, owing to the insurance coverage. However, that requires to know, \nwithin the local insurance market:\n\n\u2022\t Which risks are insurable and which ones are not?\n\n\u2022\t Are there exclusion clauses and if so how do they operate?\n\n\u2022\t Will deductibles apply, and if so what is their amount?\n\nOther? \n\n\u2022\t Specific procedures for insurance claims?\n\n\u2022\t What is the maximum insurance coverage? Is it capped per insurance claim? Per year? In the aggregate? \n\n Anyone having had to make an insurance claim knows that care must be given to the details of an insurance \npolicy, and that while one may think that he or she is properly covered this might not turn out to be the \ncase when making an actual insurance claim. Such unfortunate situations inevitably make it that the Party \nwhich thought to be covered will end up bearing the financial loss it erroneously believed to be relieved \nfrom by insurance. \n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n The  SBD  incorporates  a  specific  Appendix  to  the  PCC  dedicated  to  the  insurance  matters  under  the \nContract.\n\n The Employer should review, and amend and/or supplement as necessary, the insurance provisions of the \nContract under GCC Clause 19 and this Appendix 3, to reflect:\n\n\u2022\t Any mandatory insurance requirements under the laws of the country. For example, certain jurisdictions \nimpose insurances to be taken for the so-called decennial liability, being the liability of the Contractor, \nwithin  10  years  from  taking-over  of  the  Works,  for  any  defect  which  may  affect  the  stability  of  the \nWorks and/or their fitness for purpose, and\n\n\u2022\t Any  insurance  locally  available  at  commercially  reasonable  rates  in  relation  with  the  facility  to  be \ndesigned, built, and operated under the Contract. For example, Business Interruption insurances can \nbe available and cover losses in case the facility is to be shut down for a certain period of time.\n\n69. \n\n Insurance  due  diligence  should  be  carried  out  by  the  Employer  at  project  preparation  stage,  in  liaison \nwith insurance specialists (lawyers, brokers, and/or consultants) familiar with the insurance practices in \n\n\f20\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nthe country, to determine what insurances can/must be implemented under the Contract, and at what \nterms. The insurance due diligence should also highlight whether, owing to the project features, it might \nbe in the better interest of the Employer to directly take some of the insurances which are to be provided \nby the Contractor under GCC subclauses 19.2 and 19.3. If this is the case, Clause 19 should be amended \naccordingly by the Employer, under the Particular Conditions Part B, and its Appendix 3, found in Section \n8 of this SBD.\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n21\n\n70. \n\n71. \n\n72. \n\n73. \n\n74. \n\n75. \n\nrisk of Contract Misadministration\n\nrisk Description\n\n The administration of a FIDIC DBO contract partly equates to the administration of a FIDIC Yellow Book \ncontract followed by an operation period, but there are additional specificities to handle such as the asset \nreplacement mechanisms and performance damages.\n\n This requires technical and engineering skills from the Employer (for all matters in relation with the design, \nexecution, and operation of the works), but also administration skills to be able to handle the payment \nscheme,  the  set  of  performance  standards  defined  under  the  Contract  and  their  compliance,  and  the \nmanagement of claims and variations as per the terms and timing set out in the contract. \n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n It  is  frequent  under  projects  financed  by  ADB  that  the  Implementing  Agency  is  not  staffed  to  fulfill \nthose  tasks.  A  procurement  risk  assessment  of  the  implementing  agency\u2019s  contract  management/\nadministration resources should be made as part of the project preparation process,24 which may lead to \nrecommend reinforcement accordingly in case the capacities in place are assessed as insufficient to meet \nthe requirements. Capacities strengthening can be done through training of in-house personnel and/or \nrecruitment of new personnel and/or reinforcement through a Consulting Engineering firm\u2019s dedicated \npersonnel. \n\n Generally, a consulting engineering firm is mobilized to be the engineer under the construction contract, \nacting for and on behalf of the Employer. It is recommended to keep having such mechanism in place in \nthe frame of a DBO Contract, at least for the design\u2013build period. The Operation Service Period requires \nfar less regular interactions with the Contractor, hence either the Employer would handle this directly, or a \nConsulting Engineer could still be mobilized but with obviously much more intermittent inputs than under \nthe design\u2013build period.\n\n It is nevertheless recommended to ensure sufficient training/capacity building of the project administration \nteam  to  make  it  able  to  cope  with  the  specific  requirements  of  DBO  contractual  arrangements.  Not \nonly  the  Employer\u2019s  resources,  but  also  the  consulting  engineering  firms\u2019  resources  and  possibly  the \nContractor\u2019s resources would need to ensure that they build the required capacities to successfully deliver \nDBO projects, because, although being of growing use, DBO contractual arrangements are less known \nthan other forms of contractual arrangements in the construction industry. This risk mitigation measure \nwould then be better named as \u201ctraining the construction team\u201d.\n\n However, even if mobilizing a Consulting Engineer firm to act as Employer\u2019s Representative under the DBO \nContract, the Employer needs to keep a sufficient control on his/her various contracts\u2014both the DBO \nContract, but also the consultancy services contract with the firm acting as Employer\u2019s Representative. \nIndeed,  the  Employer  needs  to  be  able  to  assess  whether  the  latter  firm  fulfills  its  contracted  services \nwith reasonable skill and care, and, if not, the Employer needs to know how to implement the relevant \ncontractual remedies. The Employer should not fully and only rely on the contract management resources \nof the firm acting as Employer\u2019s Representative, but should also have access to another source of relevant \n\n24 \n\nProject procurement risk assessment (PPRA) should be conducted in accordance with the Guide on Assessing Procurement \nRisks and Determining Project Procurement Classification, which is available at the ADB Business Center website at https://\nwww.adb.org/business/main.\n\n\f22\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\ncontract management resources. Contract management matters should not fully rest in the hands of one \nservice provider.\n\n76 \n\n Various  options  can  be  envisaged  for  the  Employer  to  have  access  to  a  pool  of  relevant  contract \nmanagement resources, such as\n\n\u2022\t mobilizing in-house personnel, with the relevant contract management skills and experience, and/or \n\ngoing through relevant training curriculum;\n\n\u2022\t\n\nrecruiting new personnel, with the relevant contract management skills and experience;\n\n\u2022\t mobilizing individual consultants; and/or\n\n\u2022\t as is often the case in large-scale construction projects, mobilizing a project management consultancy \n(PMC)  firm  which  would  deliver  specific  support  services  such  as  contract  management  services, \ncost  control  services,  planning/programming  services,  document  control,  etc.\u2014i.e.,  services  which \nare often called \u201cProject Controls\u201d. This option would also allow bridging several project management \ngaps  which  are  encountered  in  practice,  since  beside  contract  management,  there  are  often  issues \nassociated with the determination of cost and time impact of variations/changes for which forensic \nassessment capabilities are required, which are often lacking.\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n23\n\nChanges in Laws and regulations\n\nrisk Description\n\n77. \n\n Over the lifetime of a DBO project, especially under its 20-year Operation Service Period, it is highly likely \nthat changes in laws and regulations relevant to the facility operation will occur. In particular, for treatment \nplants, water quality standards for water supply may change and become more stringent, and the same is \nexpected for wastewater treatment plant effluents before their discharge into the recipient environment. \nThis  generally  goes  in  the  direction  of  requiring  more  technologies  and  processes  to  be  mobilized  and \nimplemented.\n\n78. \n\n Another typical occurrence is with the change in the applicable tax regime.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n79. \n\n This risk is generally outside the control of the Parties, hence there are few preventive mitigation measures \nwhich  the  Employer  could  think  of  implementing,  beyond  what  the  FIDIC  Gold  Book  contract  terms \nalready foresee and as integrated under Section 7 of this SBD. Indeed:\n\n\u2022\t GCC  Subclause  5.4  provides  that  in  case  the  Laws  and  standards  applicable  to  the  Works  change \nafter the Base Date (which is 28 days prior to the latest date for submission of tenders, i.e., the time \nafter which the Contractor cannot reasonably be expected to be able to reflect any such change into  \nhis/her bid), then necessary changes are dealt with as a variation entitling the Contractor to additional \ntime and payment;\n\n\u2022\t GCC  Subclause  13.6  provides  that  if  the  Contractor  suffers  from  any  delay  and/or  incurs  costs \nbecause of a change in laws occurring after the base date, he/she is then entitled to additional time \nand payment; and\n\n\u2022\t GCC  Subclause  13.7  provides  for  the  same  in  case  the  Contractor  is  to  adopt  new  technologies, \n\nmaterials, or products.\n\n80. \n\n As can be seen from the above, the Gold Book allocates the risk of changes in laws to the Employer, by \nmaking him/her liable to compensate the Contractor for any delay suffered and/or costs incurred.\n\n\f24\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nPermits and authorizations\n\nrisk Description\n\n81. \n\nMany permits and authorizations are required for water facilities, and some examples are given below:\n\n\u2022\t Planning/land  use  permit,  issued  by  a  municipality,  a  county,  or  any  other  local  Authority,  and \n\nsometimes State Authority depending on the magnitude of a facility\n\n\u2022\t Building permit\n\n\u2022\t Environmental Authority permit\n\n\u2022\t Sanitation Authority permit\n\n\u2022\t Permits related to the execution of the works\u2014for example from a Transportation Authority when it \nis about doing an open-cut across a road, or from Utility Authorities for relocation of public services \ninfrastructure (power, water, gas, telecommunication, heating, etc.).\n\n Despite provisions such as under this SBD Section 7 (GCC Subclause 1.14), requiring that all necessary \ndetails be developed in the Employer\u2019s Requirements, it is in practice often the case that those do not \ndetail who is to obtain which permit from whom, how, and by when. This can generate confusion in the \ncontract implementation, and it is to be borne in mind that the Gold Book GCC Subclause 9.4 entitles \nthe Contractor to an extension of the time for completion in case of delays caused by the authorities. \nConfusion on matter of permits and authorizations from authorities having jurisdiction over the project is \nthen likely to be ruled against the Employer.\n\n Even when the definition of the permits to obtain, and the allocation of responsibilities for those, is clear \nin the Contract, it is frequent that local authorities cause delays to the execution of the Works. There \nare many reasons for such delays such as, among other things, understaffing, lack of skills and resources, \nconflicting political influences, or inter-administration negative relationships.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD \n\n Clear  definition  of  which  permits  are  to  be  obtained,  how  and  by  who  and  when,  is  required  under  a \nspecific section of the Employer\u2019s Requirements in Section 6 of this SBD.\n\n Beside the Bidding Document itself, early involvement (before the Contract starts) by the Employer of \nall  involved  local/state  authority  is  recommended,  by  means  of  dedicated  committee  (consultation/\nadvisory committee for instance), to develop project ownership from their side, and proactively tackle all \nissues and as early as possible.\n\n82. \n\n83. \n\n84. \n\n85. \n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n25\n\nContractor\u2019s Non-Excusable Delays\n\nrisk Description\n\n86. \n\n87. \n\n88. \n\n89. \n\n90. \n\n91. \n\n92. \n\n There are many instances where the Contractor can end up being in default, i.e., failing to execute his/her \ncontractual obligations. Several default cases are already specifically addressed elsewhere in this Preface \n(insolvency, underperforming facility, etc.), hence are not repeated here.\n\n This section deals with the Contractor\u2019s non-excusable delays. Those delays are those suffered by the \nContractor and for which he/she cannot be contractually excused, i.e., for which cannot benefit for an \nextension of the time for completion under the design\u2013build period (as per GCC Subclause 9.3) or from a \nmonetary compensation during the Operation Service Period (as per GCC Subclause 10.6). \n\n This is typically the case when the Contractor is late in issuing design drawings, procuring and delivering \nto the Site the necessary Plant, Materials, and Contractor\u2019s Equipment, or in rectifying and remedying \ndefective works. These are all the instances where, in the design, construction, and operation of the Works, \nthe Contractor is acting below the standard of performance expected from an experienced Contractor in \nprojects of similar size and nature, exercising due skill and care.\n\n While delay damages are provided for under the Contract, it should not be forgotten that those are capped \n(generally 10% of the Contract Price) and that they are the sole remedy for the Contractor\u2019s default in \nmeeting the time for completion. There are consequently instances where the amount of delay damages \nmight be below the actual loss suffered by the Employer because of a Contractor\u2019s non-excusable delay, \nand the difference would not be recoverable by the Employer.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n A first mitigation measure, which is always implemented under ADB financed projects, is to proceed with \nthe qualification of the Contractor based on his/her demonstration that he/she has the required skills, \nexperience, and resources to carry out the project. This is evidenced by successful past project experience, \nplus  statements  as  to  his/her  capacity  to  timely  mobilize  the  required  resources  for  implementing  the \ncontract (personnel, equipment). This measure is duly reflected under sections 3, 4, and 6 of the Bidding \nDocument.\n\n Another risk mitigation measure, which is also generally always foreseen in contracts financed by ADB, is \nthe use of delay damages acting as a deterrent toward the Contractor to be in delay for the execution of \nthe Works. This is duly reflected under sections 7 and 8 of this SBD.\n\n However,  breaking  down  the  time  for  completion  of  design\u2013build  into  several  intermediary  progress \nmilestones is also a useful way to monitor the progress, as it allows for more proactive time management \nof the execution of the works. Delays can be identified much earlier, especially if the Contract Employer\u2019s \nRequirements  include  a  specific  section  dedicated  to  Programme  requirements  which  would  define \nthe level of details to be provided in the Contractor\u2019s programme (critical path method, number of tasks \nfor  programme  level,  type  of  logic  links  in  between  the  tasks,  etc.).  This  would  facilitate  the  contract \nadministration on the Employer\u2019s side, and allow for proactive, timely, and efficient decisions. Accordingly, \nSection 6 of this SBD integrates a specific area to be considered for Programme Requirements in particular, \nand for progress monitoring matters in general.\n\n93 \n\n It should be noted that the progress milestones referred to here are not necessarily sections of Works \nas defined under GCC Subclause 1.1.70. Sections are physical parts of the Works which are introduced \n\n\f26\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n94. \n\n95. \n\nwhenever the Employer contemplates different construction priorities and wants to allocate a different \ntime for completion for each section. A typical example under a WTP project would be to have\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe raw water transmission main set as a specific Section; \n\nthe WTP (strictly speaking) set as another Section of the Works; and\n\n\u2022\t where the contract would provide that the time for completion of the raw water main Section ends \n\nseveral months before the time for completion of the WTP. \n\n As a difference with Sections, progress milestones may but may not be physical parts of the Works and are \nmainly there to reflect specific progress objectives which the Employer wants the Contractor to meet in \ntime. In the example, the raw water main Section could for instance integrate several progress milestones \nto be met such as the delivery of preliminary design drawings, the delivery of detailed design drawings, the \nsupply and delivery to the Site of the required pipes and fittings, the pressure testing of the first 500 meters of \npipes laid, etc. Employers introduce progress milestones whenever there are interfacing requirements to be \nconsidered (for example, the Employer may need to have design drawings submitted by a certain time before \nconstruction starts to be able to obtain a necessary authorization from a third party in a timely manner),  \nand/or  whenever  the  Employer  wants  to  keep  close  and  detailed  control  over  the  progress  of  the \nContractor.\n\n Another measure also lies with the skills and competencies of the contract administration staff on the \nEmployer\u2019s side. FIDIC Contracts in general, and the Gold Book in particular, provide powerful remedies in \ncase of Contractor\u2019s non-excusable delays. Beside the application of delay damages under GCC Subclause \n9.6, or the claim for losses and damages under the Operation Service Period as per GCC Subclause 10.6, \nthere is also the possibility to instruct an acceleration of the rate of progress under GCC Subclause 9.5, \nthe  issue  of  Notices  to  correct  under  GCC  Subclause  15.1,  and,  ultimately  the  Contract  termination \nprovisions under GCC Subclause 15.2 if the delay becomes too severe and to such an extent that it causes \noverly extensive losses and damages to the Employer. If experienced contract administration resources \nare not available in-house, the Employer\u2019s capacities can be reinforced by the mobilization of a consulting \nengineering firm acting as Employer\u2019s Representative, or by a project management consultancy firm or by \nindividual consultants as defined under paras. 73 to 77 above. \n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n27\n\nC)\u2002risks during the Contract Procurement Period\n\nrushed Procurement Process\n\nrisk Description\n\n96. \n\nThe pressure to initiate the bidding process is sometimes intense for various reasons such as\n\n\u2022\t Local political reasons, where a specific political agenda may impose time pressure on the Employer, \n\nhence on the project;\n\n\u2022\t Upstream delays encountered in the project implementation and which the Employer tries to offset \nby initiating the bidding process as early as possible, for example in relation with deadlines in the loan \nagreement for implementing certain stages of the project;\n\n\u2022\t Misconception that the bidding process is an \u201cavailable float\u201d time in the project schedule, which can be \nreduced as much as possible and which generates unnecessary delays in the project implementation;\n\n\u2022\t One-sided views of the project or a lack of global view and understanding as to what can be seen as \n\nreasonable for bidding purposes, not considering, e.g., the Contractor\u2019s viewpoint; and\n\n\u2022\t Unrealistic views on the market reality, under the erroneous beliefs that an \u201call risks on the Contractor\u201d \napproach is fine since there will always be someone eager to get the job, whatever the risk profile is.\n\n97. \n\n Entering into a DBO contract means, from a Contractor\u2019s perspective, entering a long-term relationship \n(many years and possibly decades) with an Employer. The DBO contract amount and duration at stake \nmechanically make it that the Contractor needs time for taking ownership on the bidding document, on \nthe project situation, on what he/she is asked to price, and on the determination of the risk profile he/she \nis facing. A sustainable relationship cannot be envisaged without the parties getting to know each other for \na sufficient minimum time to ascertain whether they agree to go forward and confirm their relationship\u2014\nor break up before any harm is done (no bid submitted, no contract negotiations ended) and part ways.\n\n98. \n\n International practice tends to show that\n\n\u2022\t an overall DBO procurement process, from the time an Invitation for Prequalification is issued, to the \n\ntime the DBO Contract is in place, is in the range of 12\u201318 months; and\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe  bid  submission  period,  i.e.,  the  time  in  between  the  issue  of  an  Invitation  for  Bids  and  the  bid \nsubmission deadline, is in the range of 3\u20135 months.\n\n99. \n\n The risks which can arise from a rushed procurement process would typically be as follows:\n\n\u2022\t A greater number of \u201cno go\u201d or \u201cno bid\u201d decisions from competent contractors, who would assess that \nthe  rushed  procurement  process  would  not  give  them  enough  time  to  properly  ascertain  the  DBO \ncontract requirements and risks, and would then not be worth the effort and expense of preparing a \nfull-fledged bid.\n\n\u2022\t\n\nIncrease  of  risk  premiums  taken  by  Contractors,  under  the  assumption  that  if  there  is  not  enough \ntime  or  information  to  ascertain  the  DBO  contract  requirements  and  risks,  then  conservative  risk \nfinancial provisions would be factored in in the Contractor\u2019s bid to be able to face \u201cworst case scenario\u201d \nsituations. As a corollary, the Employer would possibly pay undue risk premium, and possibly face a \nsituation where all qualified bids exceed the available budget.\n\n\f28\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n\u2022\t\n\nIncreasing  risk  to  select  a  bidder  who  may  not  be  the  most  suitable  one,  but  one  who  may  have \noverlooked/underestimated  the  risk  profile,  since  a  rushed  procurement  process  would  tend  to \nincrease the financial bid gap in between those who assess carefully the risk profile, and those who \noverlook/underestimate it (for various reasons \u2013 understaffing or not relevant bid preparation team \nstaffing, commercial pressure to \u201cget a job\u201d, etc.).\n\n\u2022\t Finally, by trying to do everything urgently, nothing is done properly. As a result, the benefit of trying \nto save several weeks in a procurement process by, for example, unduly reducing the bid submission \nperiod down to unreasonable levels, is often outweighed in practice by the drawback of delays suffered \nowing to many bidders\u2019 queries or to possible deadline extensions or re-bidding. In the end, what was \ninitially meant to save a couple of weeks results in the process suffering from more delays than if a \nproper and reasonable timeframe had been allocated in the first place.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n100. \n\n Reasonable timing shall be allocated by the Employer in the procurement process, and in particular no less \nthan 90 days for the bid submission period.\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n29\n\nCapacity of the Bid Evaluation team\n\nrisk Description\n\n101. \n\n The  evaluation  of  Design\u2013Build  and  Design\u2013Build\u2013Operate  contract  bids  require  specific  skills  and \nresources, related to:\n\n\u2022\t The  evaluation  of  various  preliminary  design  proposals,  and  the  verification  whether  they  comply \nwith Employer\u2019s Requirements. For example, a RFP for a DBO contract on a WWTP, may see bidders \ncoming up with a wide range of treatment processes, both conventional processes such as activated \nsludge  or  trickling  filters,  but  also  more  recent  compact  processes  such  as  SBR,  bio  filtration,  etc. \nincluding sometimes patented processes which are unique products of the bidder.\n\n\u2022\t The assessment of the reliability and credibility of performance parameters announced by the bidders, \n\nincluding OPEX projections.\n\n\u2022\t The capacity to handle requests for clarifications from the bidders in an efficient manner.\n\n\u2022\t The capacity to enter into complex engineering discussions with the bidders, regarding their bids and \n\nthe project site data and information.\n\n102. \n\n Generally, Employers on projects financed by international financial institutions are public water utilities \nwho may not have the necessary in-house, high-profile process experts available.\n\n103. \n\n The risk for the Employer is then to either:\n\n\u2022\t be \u201cduped\u201d by a bid, and miss elements which would have otherwise led to reject it; or\n\n\u2022\t on the contrary, not being able to understand the specific added value brought by a bidder. By lack of \nconfidence as to that bid, and under the fear to commit a mistake, the Employer may then prefer to \nreject it, hence may miss a valuable opportunity.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n104. \n\n The  bid  evaluation  team  should  be  composed  of  suitably  qualified  experts,  able  to  handle  all  the \ntechnological and engineering aspects of the bids. As stated in para. 73 above, capacity assessment of \nthe Implementing Agency\u2019s resources should be made, which may lead to recommend reinforcement in \ncase the capacities in place are assessed as insufficient to meet the requirements. Capacity strengthening \ncan be done through training of in-house personnel and/or recruitment of in-house personnel and/or \nreinforcement through a consulting engineering firm\u2019s dedicated personnel.\n\n105. \n\n If external consultants are recruited, they should be mobilized under time-based contract arrangements, \nsince lump sum contracts are not practicable in such situations where the amount of inputs to be spent \nwill be depending on the number of bids received, their complexity, and the level of interactions with the \nbidders during the bidding period.

Examples drawn from practice are given below:\n\n\u2022\t\n\nIt  was  thought  that  a  new  WWTP  was  to  be  connected  to  a  DN500  pipeline  conveying  municipal \nwastewater, while in actual fact this is a DN600. This will require adapting the design and changing the \nconnection fittings.\n\n\u2022\t The municipal wastewater loads (BOD5, COD, etc.) and flow which were foreseen in the Employer\u2019s \nRequirements, and defined as design loads and flow, are not corresponding to the actual loads and \nflow because the design data were based on existing literature and extrapolations, but without any site \nmeasurement campaign being done to verify those assumptions. This will require the Contractor to \nadapt the preliminary design he/she developed and upon which he/she submitted his/her bid.\n\n\u2022\t No hard rock was foreseen in the ground where the WTP is to be built. No information in that direction \nwas  given  to  the  Contractor  at  bidding  stage,  since  no  geotechnical  surveys  were  done  at  project \npreparation stage, and no one knew the actual underground condition, but everyone thought that \u201cit \nwas fine.\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\n\nIt  was  anticipated  that  good  stable  soil  would  be  available  at  the  WWTP  location,  but  when  the \nContractor started to make his/her own soil investigations, he/she found out that there is too much soft \nsoil and that piling works will be required to support the WWTP on a lower subsurface stable stratum. \n\n108. \n\n Those  situations  are  often  experienced  when  project  preparation  stages  do  not  incorporate  site \ninvestigations, such as geotechnical surveys, topographic surveys, flow and loads measurement campaigns \nin the catchment basin of a future WWTP, flow and pressure measurement in a water supply network, etc. \nNormally, the master plan of a water supply and sewerage system, defining a phased investment plan, shall \nbe based on an up-to-date diagnostic assessment of the infrastructure. However, it is frequent that these \nare  not  carried  out,  for  various  reasons  such  as  unintentional  omissions,  absence  of  budget  allocation \nfor executing the necessary measurement campaigns, or willingness to shorten the project preparation \nprocess to the expense of such investigations.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n109. \n\n Execution  of  site  investigations,  before  finalizing  Employer\u2019s  Requirements  and  starting  the  bidding \nprocess, to verify design basis assumptions, and validity/accuracy of key data contained in the Employer\u2019s \nRequirements. Such site investigations would typically be:\n\n\u2022\t For a network DBO contract:\n\nlocation of existing utilities, which may be located adjacently to the place where the pipelines will \nbe laid;\n\ngeotechnical investigations\u2014sample spots to be located to ascertain the composition and structural \nstatus of the ground (hard rock, soft soil, underground water, etc.), as well as underground man-\nmade obstructions;\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\netc.\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n31\n\n\u2022\t For a process plant DBO contract:\n\n \u00bb\n\ngeotechnical investigations to ascertain underground conditions\u2014hard rock, soft soil, too soft soil \nmaking that piling works will be required, etc.;\n\n \u00bb WWTP\u2014flow and loads measurement campaign carried out in both dry and rainy periods on the \n\ncatchment basin which will convey wastewater to the new plant;\n\n \u00bb\n\netc.\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n110. \n\n For all those surveys and investigations, a balance is obviously to be defined, on a project by project basis, \namong\n\n the costs of such pre-bid investigations carried out at the expense of the Employer; \n\nthe cost of not doing those, i.e., the risk premium which a Contractor would price for and reflect \nin his/her bid; and\n\nthe costs of potential subsequent claims from the Contractor.\n\n111. \n\n112. \n\n As to the latter point, it should indeed be noted that physical conditions would be held as unforeseeable \nif it is construed that they cannot reasonably be foreseeable by an experienced Contractor by the date \nof submission of the bid. \u201cUnforeseeable\u201d is a defined term under the FIDIC Gold Book GCC Subclause \n1.1.80  (Section  7  of  the  SBD),  where  \u201cUnforeseeable  physical  conditions\u201d  entitle  the  Contractor  to \nclaim for additional time and payment under GCC Subclause 4.12, based on what the Contractor could \npractically find out/ascertain at the time of bid preparation, i.e., taking into account the cost and time for \ndoing this assessment at bidding stage, as per the terms laid down under GCC Subclause 4.10.\n\n As to other errors in Employer\u2019s Requirements, such as wrong assumptions on the input flow and loads \ncoming to a WWTP to be designed and built, the Contractor will be able to obtain a time and financial \nrelief  according  to  the  provisions  of  the  GCC  Subclause  5.1  once  he/she  reviews/scrutinizes  the \nEmployer\u2019s  Requirements  at  Contract  execution  inception.  It  is  recommended  that  the  Contractor  be \nexpressly required, by the Employer\u2019s Requirements, to perform his/her own site investigations at that \ntime. This will reduce the risk of finding such errors at a later stage during the contract execution, which \nmay generate a Contractor\u2019s claim under the provisions of GCC Subclause 1.10.\n\n113. \n\n There would typically be an iterative risk assessment process for each project. For instance, regarding the \nunderground site conditions risk, once geotechnical surveys are conducted, they may reveal concerns as \nto some areas of the project footprint. Residual risk is then to be assessed, and three options will typically \nemerge:\n\n\u2022\t \u201cno further action\u201d option, and maintaining the fIDIC gold Book provisions which partly allocate \nthe underground risk to the Employer (for whatever is deemed \u201cunforeseeable\u201d to the Contractor), and \npartly to the Contractor (for whatever is deemed to be foreseeable by the Contractor). the cost risk \nfor the employer is then the foreseeable cost of Contractor\u2019s claims for unforeseeable physical \nconditions under gCC subclause 4.12.\n\n\u2022\t \u201cno further action\u201d option and changing the fIDIC gold Book provisions as to transfer the residual \nunderground risk to the Contractor. No claim would then be allowed on that matter. the cost risk for \nthe employer is then the cost of Contractor\u2019s risk premium he/she would reflect in his/her bid.\n\n\u2022\t Carry  out  further  geotechnical  investigations  to  better  ascertain  and  abate  the  residual  risk, \nbefore deciding to initiate the bidding process based on FIDIC Gold Book Conditions as they are, or as \namended to transfer all residual risk to the Contractor.\n\n\f32\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nE)\u2002risks during the Build Period\n\nInput Data and Site Conditions risk\n\n114. \n\n115. \n\n This is as per what has been described above during the design period, although the risk should be lower \nhere in case the Contractor has duly been required to perform his/her own necessary site investigations at \ndesign stage.\n\n The aim of this early request for investigations is to anticipate any possible variation which may have to \nbe decided depending on the errors or discrepancies identified. It is indeed well known that the earlier a \nchange is introduced in a project cycle, the greater impact on cost reduction for the Employer. Conversely, \nthe later a change is introduced, the higher its cost might be for the Employer. \n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n33\n\nWeather risk\n\nrisk Description\n\n116. \n\n117. \n\n118. \n\n119. \n\n Physical works are carried out in the open air and are then subject to the impact of the forces of nature. \nThose would be, among other things, the effects of rainfall, heat, cold, snow, or wind.\n\n Under Section 7 of the SBD, GCC Subclause 9.3, the Contractor will benefit from an extension of the Time \nfor Completion in case of \u201cexceptionally adverse climatic conditions\u201d. This is very generic, and deliberately \nvague since the FIDIC Gold Book GCC is meant to be applied anywhere in the world. Understandably, \nFIDIC  could  then  not  be  more  specific  as  to  what  are  precisely  those  exceptionally  adverse  climatic \nconditions. Obviously:\n\n\u2022\t A monsoon would not be regarded as an \u201cexceptionally adverse climatic condition\u201d in Viet\u00a0Nam as it \n\noccurs every year, while it would be regarded as such in Armenia.\n\n\u2022\t However, a 10-year return monsoon could be regarded as an exceptionally adverse climatic condition \n\nin Viet Nam, since such monsoon is statistically occurring once every 10 years in the country.\n\n In  practice,  many  disputes  occur  because  of  the  lack  of  precise  definition  of  what  is  an  \u201cexceptionally \nadverse climatic condition\u201d and what is not.\n\n Even in cases where this is defined in contract, another hurdle generally comes from the measurement \ndevices. This requires a reliable, regularly calibrated measurement device, as otherwise measures might \nbe  challenged  by  either  Party.  In  practice,  many  disputes  arise  in  relation  with  the  reliability  of  the \nmeasurements, as well as with the definition of \u201cexceptionally adverse climatic condition\u201d.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n120. \n\n Defining in the Contract, for instance in the Employer\u2019s Requirements, what is meant to be an \u201cexceptionally \nadverse climatic condition\u201d. Here below is an example of such kind of definition which could be considered, \nas recently used in a project in Western Europe\n\n\u201cExceptionally  Adverse  Climatic  Conditions\u201d  means  any  of  the  following  weather  event,  as  measured  by  the \n[National Meteorological Institute] weather station in the city of XXXX in the case of subparagraphs (i)(a)-(d) \nand (iii)(a):\n\n(i) \n\nfor parts of the Works carried out externally:\n\n(a)  wind speed in excess of 60km/hour lasting more than two hours continuously;\n\n(b) \n\nrainfall resulting in more than 100mm of rainfall measured in any 12-hour period;\n\n(c)  a recorded temperature of minus 5 degrees Celsius or less at 10 a.m.;\n\n(d) \n\nsnow fall exceeding a 4-hour continuous duration between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., or a recorded layer of \nsnow at any time exceeding 20mm; and\n\n(e) \n\nlasting black ice or compacted snow preventing transport and movement on the site or access areas.\n\n(ii) \n\nfor parts of the Works carried out under cover:\n\n(a)  a recorded temperature of minus 5 degrees Celsius or less at 10 a.m. within the area where Works are \n\nbeing performed; and\n\n(b) \n\nlasting black ice or compacted snow preventing transport and movement on the site or access areas.\n\n\f34\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n(iii) \n\nfor the pouring of concrete:\n\n(a)  a recorded temperature exceeding 37 degrees Celsius continuously between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.\n\n121. \n\n122. \n\n Defining in the Contract, for instance in the Employer\u2019s Requirements, the measurement device(s) to be \nused. Ideally this should come from a neutral and reputable institution, not being suspected of any possible \nbias in the favor of either party\u2014for example, the local weather station of the National Meteorological \nInstitute.\n\n Otherwise, if no credit can be given to any external institution, the Contractor could be asked to install \nsuch  measurement  devices,  under  a  procedure  defined  in  the  Employer\u2019s  Requirements.  A  third  party \ncould also be relied on for that purpose, or simply to act as controller/verifier of supply and installation \nworks done by the Contractor.\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n35\n\nLand Clearance for access to the Site\n\nrisk Description\n\n123. \n\n The Employer is to provide access and possession of all the Site to the Contractor, as per GCC Subclause \n2.1. The Site is defined under GCC Subclause 1.1.72 as being:\n\n\u201c\u2026the places where the Permanent Works are to be executed and to which Plant and Materials are to be delivered, \nand where the Operation Service is to be provided, and any other places as may be specified in the Contract as \nforming part of the Site.\u201d\n\n124. \n\n Failure to do so will entitle the Contractor to claim for additional time and payment. In practice, access \nis not an issue for projects with a discreet and limited footprint, such as a WTP or a WWTP. However, it \nis a regular concern in the frame of pipeline construction works, especially in urban areas. The Employer \nshould  normally  have  carried  out,  at  project  preparation  stage,  a  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nPlan  (LARP).  In  practice,  it  is  often  the  case  that  a  works  contract  is  initiated  while  the  LARP  is  not \ncompleted.  The  pressure  to  initiate  the  bidding  process  (for  political  reasons,  or  because  of  upstream \ndelays encountered in the project implementation and which the Employer tries to offset by initiating the \nbidding process as early as possible) can lead to such situations.\n\n125. \n\n The Employer is then straight away faced with difficulties, due to the claim process defined under Subclause \n2.1, but also due to the fact that the programme is the Contractor\u2019s ownership under the FIDIC Gold \nBook, and that any interference from the Employer (such as instructing a change in the sequence of works \nforeseen under the programme) would be treated as a variation entitling the Contractor to additional time \nand payment.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n126. \n\n Ideally, land clearance and the LARP should be completed before the Contract starts.\n\n127. \n\n If it is not possible, then the contract terms should be amended to reflect the relevant project situation. \nSections  of  Works  could  then  be  defined  under  Section  8  of  the  SBD,  PCC  Part  A,  Subclause  1.1.70 \ninter alia. Each of those would be given a specific Time for Completion, and a specific date for access to \nthe Site. The Contractor would then, for example, know that he/she can start work on Section 1 within \n28\u00a0days from the Commencement Date, but on Section 2 within 180 days only. The number of Sections, \nand timing associated to each of those, should obviously be defined in accordance with the LARP\u2014first \nSection(s) would be the one(s) where land clearance is already completed, or planned to be completed, at \nthe Contract formation stage. Last Section(s) would be those coming last under the LARP implementation \nschedule.\n\n\f36\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nF)\u2002risks during the Operation Period\n\nNonperforming Facility/Failure to reach Production Output\n\nrisk Description\n\n128. \n\n Performance  standards  are  not  met  by  the  Contractor,  such  as  water  treatment  quality,  power \nconsumption, chemical consumption, etc.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n129. \n\n130. \n\n131. \n\n132. \n\n133. \n\n A first mitigation measure is to proceed with either the qualification of the Contractor based on his/her \ndemonstration that he/she has the required skills, experience, and resources to carry out the project. This \nis evidenced by successful past project experience, plus statements as to his/her its capacity to mobilize \nin a timely manner the required resources for implementing the contract (personnel, equipment). This \nmeasure is duly reflected under sections 3, 4, and 6 of the Bidding Document.\n\n Another  risk  mitigation  measure  relates  to  the  proper  definition  of  performance  damages.  They  are \nforeseen under the FIDIC Gold Book GCC Subclause 10.7 but not further detailed. This SBD has tackled \nthis matter by introducing key performance requirements under Section 6 (Employer\u2019s Requirements). \nThese  are  typically  those  which  have  the  greatest  impact  on  the  operating  expenditure  of  the  facility \nand/or which are critical to verify that the facility is operating as per its intended purpose. They shall be \nmeasured by Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for which the Employer should define:\n\n\u2022\t\n\nlimit  values  (minimum,  maximum)  to  be  complied  with  by  the  Contractor,  and  against  which  the \nContractor will commit to a value through his/her bid, and then under the Contract;\n\n\u2022\t performance damages if a KPI measured value shows that there is a Contractor\u2019s non-excusable breach \nof performance guarantee. Those shall then be developed under commercial terms in Appendix 2 to \nthe PCC; and\n\n\u2022\t measurement  methodology,  which  shall  be  developed  in  great  detail  in  this  section,  typically  by \n\nspecifying:\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\nthe measurement points to be used under the Contract for the set KPI;\n\nthe regular calibration methodology to be complied with; and \n\nthe measurement process to follow.\n\n Indeed, owing to the severe contractual consequences of failure by the Contractor to meet performance \nrequirements, since those are at the root of such kind of contracts, great care should be given to ensure \nthat measures are both reliable (tamper-proof, regular calibration) and easily verifiable. If need be, the \nEmployer may consider relying on an independent third party, selected by both Parties, for the setting-up \nand calibration of measurement points.\n\n According  to  the  above,  a  section  is  dedicated  to  Performance  requirements  under  the  Employer\u2019s \nRequirements in Section 6 of this SBD. \n\n Examples of KPI are given in the Schedule of Performance Guarantees under Section 4 of the Bidding \nDocument. The bidders will be required to fill in performance guarantees which shall meet any minimum/\nmaximum value for the KPI. \n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n37\n\n134. \n\n If during the Operation Service Period under the Contract, it is found that the guaranteed performance is \nnot met, performance damages will apply as per a mechanism to be detailed under Appendix 2 of the PCC \nPart B in Section 8 of this SBD. Users can refer to that section where appropriate guidance is provided as \nto the way to build a performance damages scheme. Different performance damages schemes shall apply \nin the two following instances:\n\n\u2022\t Under  GCC  Subclause  10.7  [Failure  to  Reach  Production  Outputs],  where  performance  damages  apply \n\nduring the Operation Service Period.\n\n\u2022\t GCC Subclause 11.11 [Failure to Pass Tests Prior to Contract Completion], where performance damages apply \nat the end of the Operation Service Period, i.e., at the end of the DBO Contract Period. Damages are \nthen meant to reflect the foreseeable losses likely to be incurred by the Employer over the residual life \nof the facility, i.e., in between the Contract Completion Date and the end of the expected design life \nof the facility.\n\n Note  that  this  SBD  defines  performance  requirements  as  being  those  under  the  reasonable  control  of \nthe Contractor, and directly related to his/her design, workmanship and operation skills, and experience. \nAs such, the SBD does not allocate risks to the Contractor which are better found to be borne by the \nEmployer. According to international best practices, the electricity tariff over the Operation Service Period \nis then an Employer\u2019s risk. The Contractor\u2019s risk lies with the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption \nRate, expressed in kWh per m3 produced by the WTP or the WWTP.\n\n Accordingly,  performance  incentives  have  been  explored  in  relation  with  the  electricity  costs  of  the \nfacility, as it is the main OPEX component, to foster win\u2013win arrangements. If the Contractor manages \nto find ways to do better than contracted in terms of energy consumption rate per m3 produced, the SBD \nprovides that he/she can receive, as reward/incentive for its improvement efforts, a portion of the energy \ncost  savings  made  by  the  Employer.  Payment  and  incentives  for  electricity  costs  are  developed  under \nAppendix 1 to the PCC Part B in Section 8 of this SBD.\n\n As meeting performance standards is a key element of DBO Contracts, the measurement of KPI is likely \nto be subject to disputes during the Contract implementation owing to the severe financial consequences \nthey may generate to the Contractor. Beside the definition of the measurement methodology under the \nEmployer\u2019s Requirements, as detailed above, another suitable risk mitigation measure under this SBD is to \nmake efficient use of the Auditing Body, foreseen under the Contract, in relation with KPI measurement \nand performance damages application.\n\n Indeed,  under  Section  7  of  this  SBD,  GCC  Subclause  10.3,  the  Auditing  Body  is  an  independent  and \nimpartial body whose primary role is to verify the Employer\u2019s and the Contractor\u2019s compliance with their \nContract  obligations  during  the  Operation  Service  Period.  The  SBD  lays  down,  as  Appendix  1  to  the \nEmployer\u2019s Requirements in Section 6, the Auditing Body Terms of Reference to be used by the Employer \nand the Contractor when mobilizing the Auditing Body under the Contract.\n\n135. \n\n136. \n\n137. \n\n138. \n\n139. \n\n The Auditing Body has been given the following duties in relation with KPI and performance damages:\n\n\u2022\t Routine duties \n\n \u00bb Assess the relevance of the KPI readings and recordings, and of the corresponding measurement \n\npoints setting-up, running, and calibration\n\n \u00bb Assess the relevance of any application of performance damages\n\n \u00bb\n\nIn relation with the above, make improvement recommendations to the Parties in the view of their \nfull compliance with the Contract provisions\n\n\f38\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n \u00bb\n\nIdentify any disagreement in between the Parties which has the potential of becoming a Dispute \nunder the Contract, and propose a solution to the Parties\n\n\u2022\t Ad hoc duties, i.e., at the joint request of the Parties:\n\n \u00bb Advise and give its opinion to the Parties as to the application of performance damages under the \n\nContract, taking due regard to all relevant circumstances\n\n \u00bb Assist the Parties in the resolution of any disagreement in view of avoiding that it escalates into a \n\nclaim then Dispute under the Contract\n\n \u00bb Act as expert witness in the frame of any Dispute resolution process defined under the Contract, \n\ni.e., whether in adjudication or arbitration\n\n140. \n\n Finally, as described above, to have skillful and competent Contract Administration staff, able to determine \nand apply the performance damages with reasonable skill and care, is another measure required to mitigate \nthis risk of a nonperforming facility.\n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n39\n\navailability and Suitability of Inputs from the Employer  \n(raw water, wastewater, power, personnel, etc.)\n\nrisk Description\n\n141. \n\n142. \n\n143. \n\n The input conditions for the facility, defined in Contract, are no longer met. For instance, the Contractor \ndoes not receive the wastewater loads and flows foreseen in the contract, and its WWTP does not reach \nits performance standards as a result.\n\n The Contractor would be relieved of his/her performance obligations and could claim for any additional \ncost incurred as per the FIDIC Gold Book GCC Subclauses 10.4 and 10.7.\n\n The Employer might also become subject to complaints from the facility users, for production not meeting \nthe required standards, from fines from environmental authorities, etc.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n144. \n\n Execution  of  site  investigations,  before  finalizing  Employer\u2019s  Requirements  and  starting  the  bidding \nprocess, to verify design basis assumptions, and validity/accuracy of key data contained in the Employer\u2019s \nRequirements. This relates to the measures described above for the input data and site conditions risks.\n\n\f40\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nasset replacement\n\nrisk Description\n\n145. \n\n The operation service is shorter than the life span of most of the plant equipment\u2014say it is 5 years. The \nDBO contract ends. At year 8, most of motor pumps break down, while they were meant to last 12 years \nbefore being replaced.\n\nrisk Mitigation Measures Introduced by this sBD\n\n146. \n\n147. \n\n The most direct remediation measure for the Employer is to make full use of the DBO Contract \u2019s inherent \nstrengths by having Operation Service Periods which are greater than the life span of the majority of the \nassets (except civil works)\u2014typically this could cover electrical and mechanical equipment which have life \nspans ranging from 5 to 15 years. It should be noted that the standard position advocated by FIDIC under \nthe FIDIC Gold Book is for a 20-year Operation Service Period.\n\n If not possible, and if the risk eventuates, then the Employer is back to a traditional design\u2013build situation, \nsuch as under the ADB SBD for Plant, when an asset breaks down after the contract ends and the Contractor \nleft the site. Taking due regard to the applicable statute of limitations, i.e., if the time which elapsed since \nthe cause of action accrued is still within the applicable limitation period, then the Employer may consider \na contractual claim toward the Contractor. This is of course a remedy which is harder to implement than \nwhen there is a contract in place, as there are no financial securities left or monies owed and against which \nto make deductions, but this would be the only resort available to the Employer in the case of an overly \nshort operation period. This, of course, assumes that the Employer is successful in proving that the defect \nis attributable to the Contractor and not to the operation and maintenance practices of the Employer in \nbetween the DBO contract completion and the moment the breakdown occurred. \n\n\fDESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE PROJECT TYPOLOGY AND RISK MATRIX  \nFOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n41\n\nDesign\u2013Build\u2013Operate Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  \nProjects Risk Matrix\n\n148. \n\n149. \n\n150. \n\n The above typical risks which affect a DBO Contract on water and wastewater greenfield infrastructure \nprojects  are  to  be  reviewed,  and  possibly  amended  and/or  supplemented  by  the  Employer  at  project \npreparation stage, based on the inherent features of the project.\n\n They can then be reflected through a risk matrix which is to be used as a live project management and \ndecision-making support tool, being updated every time risk mitigation measures are implemented until \nsuch time the level of residual risk is considered as acceptable by the Employer. The Bidding Document is \nthen finalized accordingly and the bidding process can start. This matrix should then also be used during \nthe Contract implementation to make sure that risks remain monitored and controlled.\n\n As a preliminary word of caution, the Employer shall by no means consider that the implementation of a \nrisk management system will by itself solve all issues and make all projects be successful. Although being \nan important and useful tool, it is only one of the various tools available for decision makers and project \nmanagers, alongside the Contract itself. It is necessary to contribute to and to increase the chances of \nhaving a successful project, but it is not self-sufficient to ensure a successful project. As for any project, \nhuman resources skills, competences, and positive dynamics are required to use and operate such tools \nproperly and satisfactorily run the project.\n\n151. \n\n It is recommended that the DBO project risk matrix includes the following fields:\n\nRisk category\u2014Cross-cutting risk, Procurement risk, Design risk, etc.\n\n \u00bb\n\nRisk owner, i.e., the person/entity in charge of managing that risk\n\n\u2022\t risk reference\n\nRisk name \n\n \u00bb Date identified\n\n\u2022\t risk details\n\nRisk description\n\nRisk potential cause\n\nRisk impact if it eventuates\n\n\u2022\t risk assessment\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n\u2022\t risk mitigation\n\n \u00bb Mitigation measure\n\nRisk probability of occurrence score, split into 5 levels, from Very Low (VL) to Very High (VH), or \n1 to 5\n\nRisk impact score split into 5 levels, from Very Low (VL) to Very High (VH), or 1 to 5 \n\nRisk score, being the multiplication of probability score by impact score, i.e., ranging from 1 to 25 \n\u2013 the higher the score, the higher the need to mitigate the risk\n\n \u00bb Mitigation owner, i.e., the one in charge of implementing the risk mitigation measure\n\n \u00bb Due date for implementation of the risk mitigation measure\n\n \u00bb\n\nResidual Risk score, upon risk mitigation measure implementation\n\n\f42\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n\u2022\t risk status\u2014upon implementation of the risk mitigation measure, the risk owner shall decide whether \n\nto declare the residual risk as:\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\nLive\u2014Residual  risk  level  not  acceptable,  further  mitigation  measures  required/or  mitigation \nmeasures in progress\n\nClosed\u2014Residual risk marginal, risk no longer an issue and no further action required\n\n \u00bb Accepted\u2014Residual  risk  cannot  be  further  reduced  under  reasonable  terms.  Residual  risks \n\naccepted as such, no further risk mitigation but risk monitoring required.\n\n152. \n\n It should be noted that the above addresses risks which have direct cost and time implications. There might \nbe other natures of risk which do not necessarily translate into direct cost and time impact. Reputational \nrisks are one of those, which can for instance occur for the Employer if and when a WTP does not operate \nsatisfactorily and water of improper quality, or not supplied continuously, is delivered to water users. The \nEmployer shall assess such kind of risks by using the same risk matrix, but then defining risk impact score \nby other terms than direct time and monetary costs.\n\n153. \n\n The example table above also highlights that the methodology used to build up a project risk matrix (i.e., \ngoing through the steps of risk identification, risk assessment, and risk mitigation) can similarly be used to \nidentify project opportunities, i.e., those which will are likely to have positive time and monetary effects, \nor other positive effects (reputation, public acceptability, etc.).\n\n\fthe Bidding Process\n\n43\n\nPrequalification\n\nInternational  practice  shows  that  prequalification  is  primarily  used  for  DBO  Contracts,  owing  to  the  following \nfeatures:\n\n\u2022\t Bidders  know  the  range  of  competition  they  are  facing  with  the  shortlist\u2014they  can  appraise  their  success \nchances accordingly and make a better-informed decision (than if no prequalification occurred) as to whether \nit is worth committing resources to develop a DBO Contract Bid.\n\n\u2022\t Absence of prequalification tends to discourage the most competent DBO Contractors to bid, as it is seen as \nreflecting a lack of experience and seriousness from the Employer, and those Contractors may consider that \nthey will not be facing a competition level playing field. Hence that their reasonable success chances are so \nslim that it is not worth investing resources in developing a Bid.\n\nNote  that  there  is  no  need  to  wait  for  the  Bidding  Document  to  be  finalized  before  initiating  Prequalification. \nPrequalification  can  be  made  as  soon  as  the  objectives  of  the  DBO  contract  are  sufficiently  advanced  for  the \nqualification  criteria  to  be  set.  Accordingly,  prequalification  can  run  in  parallel  with  the  Bidding  Document \ncompletion, and the overall procurement process time is optimized thanks to this overlapping of activities.\n\nThe  Open  Competitive  Bidding  (OCB)  process  includes  six  main  phases:  (i)  advertisement  and  notification, \n(ii) preparing and issuing the Bidding Document, (iii) bid preparation and submission, (iv) bid opening, (v) bid \nevaluation, and (vi) contract award.\n\nadvertisement and Notification\n\nInvitation  for  Bids  (IFB)  shall  be  advertised  on  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  website;1  on  a  freely  and \npublicly accessible website in English; and in a newspaper of national circulation (at least in one English language \nnewspaper, if available) or website in the borrower\u2019s country. A copy of the IFB shall be submitted to ADB for \nno-objection and for publication on the ADB website in accordance with the Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time to time).\n\nADB may additionally require that the IFB be advertised in well-known technical magazines or trade publications, \nor in newspapers of wide international circulation, in sufficient time to enable prospective Bidders to prepare and \nsubmit Bids.\n\n1 \n\n https://www.adb.org/site/business-opportunities/main.\n\n\f44\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nPreparing and Issuing a Bidding Document\n\nThe Employer is responsible for preparing and issuing the Bidding Document for a specific contract.\n\nThe Bidding Document shall be prepared by the Employer based on the appropriate SBD issued by ADB, as this is \na mandatory requirement for contracts to be financed by ADB.\n\nThe Employer shall prepare the Bidding Document using the published version of the SBD without suppressing \nor  adding  text  to  the  sections  of  the  document  that  must  be  used  without  modification,  which  are  Section  1 \n(Instructions  to  Bidders)  and  Section  7  (General  Conditions  of  Contract).

During this stage, the Employer shall:\n\n\u2022\t\n\npromptly  respond  to  requests  for  clarifications  from  Bidders  and  amend  the  Bidding  Document  if  and  as \nneeded; and\n\n\u2022\t\n\namend the Bidding Document only with prior approval of ADB.\n\nBid Opening\n\nThe Employer is responsible for the Bid Opening, which is a critical event in the bidding process. The Employer \nshall appoint experienced staff to conduct the Bid Opening, as inappropriate procedures at Bid Opening are usually \nirreversible and may lead to cancellation of the bidding process with consequential delays and waste of resources.\n\nThe Employer, in observance of best practices, shall perform the following checks:\n\n\u2022\t Conduct the Bid Opening following strictly the procedures as specified in the Instructions to Bidders for all \nBids received not later than the date and time of the bid submission deadline. The term \u201cBid Opening\u201d should \nbe understood in the context of the ITB because, as provided in the ITB, a Bid for which a Bid Withdrawal or \nBid Substitution envelope was received on time shall not be opened but returned unopened to the Bidder. The \nsequence in which Bids are handled, opened, and recorded is crucial.\n\n\u2022\t\n\nEnsure that all Bids that were received on time are accounted for, before starting the Bid Opening, as Bids that \nare not opened and read out at Bid Opening shall not be considered further.\n\n\u2022\t Not to reject any Bid at Bid Opening, except for late Bids received after the date and time of the bid submission \ndeadline. Technically, late Bids should not reach the Bid Opening, but in certain cases a Bidder may attempt to \nsubmit its Bid at the Bid Opening place after the deadline. This late Bid shall also not be considered.\n\nExamine  the  Bids  at  Bid  Opening  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Instructions  to  Bidders.  The \nEmployer shall verify at Bid Opening the validity of the documentation, such as Power of Attorney or other \nacceptable equivalent document as specified in the Instructions to Bidders. The validity of a Bid modification, \nBid withdrawal, or Bid substitution should be confirmed, because a withdrawn or substituted Bid shall not be \nopened or read out and, therefore, shall not be considered by the Employer. A valid Bid modification shall be \nopened, read out, and recorded to modify a Bid that was received on time.\n\nBid Evaluation and Contract award\n\nThe Employer is responsible for Bid evaluation and Contract award. The Employer shall appoint experienced staff \nto conduct the evaluation of the Bids. Mistakes committed at Bid evaluation may later prompt complaints from \nBidders, requiring reevaluation of the Bids, with consequent delays and waste of resources.\n\nThe Employer, in observance of best practices, shall\n\nkeep the Bid evaluation process strictly confidential;\n\nreject attempts or pressures to distort the outcome of the evaluation, including fraud and corruption; and\n\nstrictly apply only and all of the evaluation and qualification criteria specified in the Bidding Document.\n\nFurther guidance as to Bid evaluation is provided in the following section. \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\f46\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nUse of Electronic Procurement System\n\nWhen  an  electronic  procurement  system  is  being  used,  the  applicable  procedures  of  the  bidding  process  such \nas (i) advertisement and notification, (ii) preparing and issuing the Bidding Document, (iii) Bid preparation and \nsubmission, (iv) Bid opening, (v) Bid evaluation, and (vi) contract award, including the means of communication \nbetween the Employer and Bidders, shall be specified in Section 2 (Bid Data Sheet).\n\n\f47\n\nHow to Conduct the Bid evaluation\n\n1. \n\n The SBD gives the possibility to the users to consider using either a single-stage: two-envelope or a \ntwo-stage  procedure.  Table  3  provides  comparative  pros  and  cons  to  be  considered  by  users  when \nforming their choice.\n\ntable 3: Comparison of single-stage: two-envelope and two-stage procedure\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nSingle-stage \nbidding procedure\n\nShorter bidding procedure\n\nRegular practice in several countries, and of \nsome financing institutions\n\nSupported by construction industry \npractitioners \n\nDoes not allow for bids to be amended on \nsubstance or price/Only technical and \nadministrative clarifications can be brought\n\nIncreased risk of disqualifying bidders and \ndecreasing the competition range\n\nTwo-stage bidding \nprocedure\n\nBids can be extensively discussed with \nbidders, and possibly amended through \nthe issue of revised Bidding Document in \nbetween stage 1 and stage 2.\n\nLonger bidding procedure, more complex to \nhandle\n\nMay act as a deterrent to Bidders\u2019 innovation \nand engineering added values\n\nBidders are given the opportunity to amend \ntheir first-stage technical proposal through \nthe second stage, hence reducing the risk \nof misunderstanding of the Employer\u2019s \nRequirements leading to the premature \nrejection of what could otherwise be a \nresponsive Bid.\n\nBidders can \u201ctest\u201d the technical \nresponsiveness of any innovation they wish to \nbring forward in their first-stage bid, without \nrunning the risk of seeing their bid rejected at \nthat stage.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\f48\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n2. \n\n The above matters are further explained as follows:\n\n\u2022\t A two-stage bidding process can act as a deterrent to bidder\u2019s innovation and engineering added value. \nA bidder proposing innovations in stage one is deterred to do so if such proposals are taken on board \nby  the  Employer,  reflected  in  an  amended  RFP  and  then  imposed  to  all  bidders.  The  Procurement \nRegulations  for  ADB  Borrowers:  Goods,  Works,  Nonconsulting  and  Consulting  Services  (2017,  as \namended from time to time),1 however, clearly draws to the attention of the users that confidentiality \nand intellectual property rights of bidders should be respected when moving from stage one to stage \ntwo and issuing an amended Bidding Document. However, there is always a risk in practice that the \nideas and added values of a bidder at stage one happen to benefit bidders at stage two.\n\n\u2022\t Single-stage: two-envelope procedure is used in several countries, and by international institutions, \nfor Design\u2013Build or DBO contracts. Indeed, several countries have gone for such option, instead of a \ntwo-stage bidding approach, when realizing that the first stage of a two-stage bidding process was not \nproviding the expected added value, where all bidders avoid revealing their innovation and engineering \nstrengths and were keeping those for the second stage under the fear that such strengths would be \ntransferred, hence would benefit, their competitors. \n\n\u2022\t As per ADB procedures, a one-stage procedure only allows for clarifications to be requested during \nbid  evaluation,  but  no  substantial  amendments  can  be  made  to  bids.  Article  69  of  Appendix  3  of \nthe Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers provides that \u201cThe borrower may ask bidders for any \nclarification needed to evaluate their bids but shall not ask or permit bidders to change the substance or price \nof their bids after the bid opening or to provide material documents required by the bidding documents\u201d. \nAccordingly, if clarifications are requested on a Bidder\u2019s technical proposal and if it is determined that \nthe  Bidder  failed  to  perceive  the  full  extent  of  the  Employer\u2019s  Requirements,  the  Bidder  might  end \nup being disqualified, while under a two-stage procedure he/she would have had the opportunity to \namend his/her bid. This might be considered to a certain extent as a detrimental loss of competition \nagainst the Employer\u2019s interests.\n\n\u2022\t As per the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers, Article 5 of Appendix 3, a two-stage bidding \nmay  be  used  where  it  is  undesirable  or  impractical  to  prepare  complete  technical  specifications  in \nadvance,  in  which  case  unpriced  technical  proposals  are  invited  on  the  basis  of  a  conceptual  design \nor performance specification. However, a DBO Contract is a performance-based contract where the \nContractor is expected to deliver a design solution that meets the purpose defined by the Employer, and \nthere is no requirement for the Employer to prepare detailed technical specifications. Only performance \nspecifications  are  to  be  drawn  up  and  reflected  in  the  Employer\u2019s  Requirements.  Since  no  detailed \ntechnical  specifications  are  to  be  prepared  by  the  Employer  under  a  DBO  Contract,  and  while  such \npreparation is the reason for the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers to recommend a two-\nstage bidding process, the purpose of a two-stage bidding process for a DBO Contract is not fully obvious \nand a one-stage bidding process can then be line with the procurement regulations. \n\n\u2022\t On  a  recent  market  survey  launched  by  ADB  toward  the  global  construction  industry,  65%  of  the \nrespondents support a one-stage bidding process, and 30% support a two-stage bidding process.\n\n3. \n\n The SBD systematically recommends users not to be more prescriptive than necessary in laying down \ntheir requirements. The Employer would not benefit from the engineering added value of contractors, \nhence  from  the  best  value  for  money,  if  a  reference  design  is  imposed  with  a  wide  range  of  imposed \nspecific  features.  For  example,  the  WTP  and  WWTP  construction  industry  accounts  for  many  players \nwho have developed specific design, build, and operation skills and experience over the years and across \nthe world, and sometimes patented processes which an Employer cannot benefit from if he/she comes up \nwith overly prescriptive Employer\u2019s Requirements to be complied with by the Bidders. It is also expected \n\n1 \n\nSee footnote 2 in Appendix 3 of the procurement regulations.\n\n\fHOW TO CONDUCT THE BID EVALUATION\n\n49\n\nthat the breadth of skills and experience available with the Bidders are larger than what the Employer and \nhis/her consultants can directly mobilize themselves. It might accordingly well be that there are other \nfeatures of interest for the project that the Employer and his/her consultants have not perceived, and \nthat the Bidders could propose for the best interest of the project, and for the benefit of the communities \nserved by the project.\n\n Again,  DBO  Contracts  are  performance-based  contracts,  and  should  be  treated  as  such  by  the \nEmployer. The Employer\u2019s primary concern shall then be to set the purpose of the facility (as per part 3 \nof the SBD Section 6\u2014Employer\u2019s Requirements), his/her performance requirements (as per part 4 of \nthe SBD Section 6\u2014Employer\u2019s Requirements), and the various constraints to be complied with by the \nContractor (see parts 5 and 6 of the SBD Section 6\u2014Employer\u2019s Requirements), but to then leave a full \ninnovation and engineering proposal area to the market within those boundaries. \n\n The evaluation of technical Bids shall typically focus on verifying that the Employer\u2019s Requirements are \nmet by the Bid. This will include a systematic check that each item of the Employer\u2019s Requirements, whose \nstructure is provided for under Section 6 of this SBD, is fulfilled in the Technical Bid. It will include, among \nother things:\n\n\u2022\t\n\nidentifying the merits and possible drawbacks, the pros and cons of the technology solution proposed \nby a bidder to assess whether it meets the Employer\u2019s Requirements; and\n\n\u2022\t ascertaining  whether  the  performance  guarantees  to  which  the  bidder  commits  are  realistic  and \n\nachievable.\n\n It is normal that many queries would emerge, from the Employer\u2019s evaluation, regarding the features of the \ntechnology proposed by the Bidders, owing to the process complexities and frequent innovation in that \nfield. Exchanges with the Bidders are consequently to be seen as normal, and should not be discouraged. \nIt  should  be  noted  that  certain  countries  organize  hearings  of  Bidders  during  the  evaluation  process, \nwhere they are given the opportunity to orally present their Technical Bid and to answer any question from \nthe Evaluation Committee. It is seen as a sound practice which has, when well prepared, a strong time \nand resource savings potential compared to the usual practice of sending requests for clarifications and \nreceiving responses, owing to the usual difficulty which could emerge from:\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe way a mind-set/an idea is, properly or not, converted into intelligible words which truly reflect the \nintended purpose of their originator; and\n\nthe way those words, whether reflecting or not the intended purpose, are understood by the recipient, \nin the expected manner or not.\n\n evaluation of Price Bids should be based on a whole life cycle cost approach, i.e., if the DBO Operation \nService Period is lower than the life span of the facility, the Bid price should be increased, for evaluation \npurposes only, to cover the difference between the life span expectancy of the facility and the Operation \nService Period duration. The process defined under Section 3 of the SBD provides all required details to \nperform such evaluation. \n\n Ultimately,  this  methodology  shall  allow  the  Employer  to  be  confident  in  that  he/she  selected  the \nsubstantially responsive Bid which brings the lowest life cycle cost for the facility.\n\n The  above  would  of  course  require  mobilizing  a  competent  and  experienced  team  to  perform  the  bid \nevaluation,  in  support  to  the  Employer,  with  the  right  blend  of  skills  and  experience  to  deal  with  the \ntechnical/engineering  aspects  of  bids,  as  well  as  the  economic  and  contractual  aspects.  A  capacity \nassessment of the executing agency\u2019s resources should be made, which may recommend reinforcement \naccordingly  in  case  the  capacities  in  place  are  assessed  as  insufficient  to  meet  the  requirements. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6 \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n\f50\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nCapacities  strengthening  can  be  done  through  training  of  in-house  personnel  and/or  recruitment  of \nin-house personnel and/or reinforcement through a consulting engineering firm\u2019s dedicated personnel  \nand/or individual consultants.\n\n10. \n\n In  case  the  Employer  mobilizes  Consultants  to  set  up  the  bid  evaluation  team,  assignments  would  be \nperformed on time-based consultancy services contract, since the actual level of inputs required from \nthe Consultant cannot be foreseen with sufficient accuracy to set a lump sum services contract, owing to \nmatters which are beyond the reasonable control of the Consultant such as:\n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n\u2022\t The  magnitude  of  requests  for  clarification  from  Bidders,  the  magnitude  of  Bidding  Document \nAddenda, if any, in relation with the Bidding Document quality and completeness, and with any new \nproject circumstances to be accommodated and which might emerge during the bidding process.\n\n\u2022\t The  magnitude  of  Employer\u2019s  requests  for  clarification  on  Bids,  in  relation  with  the  quality  and \n\ncompleteness of Bids submitted by Bidders.\n\n\u2022\t The  extent  of  compliance,  by  the  Employer  and  the  Bidders,  with  the  requirements  of  the  Bidding \n\nDocument.\n\n Sample  Terms  of  Reference  for  a  DBO  Bid  Evaluation  Committee  are  appended  to  this  section,  for \nreference purposes.\n\n Finally,  a  question  is  often  raised  by  practitioners  as  to  whether  joint  Ventures  should  be  handled \ndifferently in the procurement process than Bidders bidding as a single entity, in other words if Joint \nVenture should be factored in as an additional risk to the Employer. This is coming from the belief that, \nfor instance, there might be a design\u2013build contractor bidding with an Operator under a Joint Venture \narrangement and that, during the Operation Service Period, the design\u2013build contractor would be likely \nto walk away hence making it difficult for the Employer to have a recourse in case a design or build issue \narises. Users should be warned against such erroneous belief, for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022\t The  General  Conditions  of  Contract,  in  Section  7  of  this  Bidding  Document,  provides  under  their \nSubclause 1.15 that all members of a Joint Venture are jointly and severally liable to the Employer for \nthe performance of the Contract. \n\n\u2022\t This accordingly means that, in the aforementioned case, the design\u2013build contractor cannot legally \n\u201cwalk away\u201d from the Joint Venture once the design\u2013build period is over. He/she remains liable to the \nEmployer for any breach of Contract that he/she committed during the design\u2013build period, but also \nthat the Operator might commit during the Operation Service Period. The latter case would occur, \nfor example, if and when the Operator becomes insolvent then liquidated\u2014all liabilities of the Joint \nVenture as a whole, including those stemming from the past wrongdoings of the Operator, would be \nlegally borne by the design\u2013build partner under the Joint Venture.\n\n\u2022\t\n\nIt  is  often  the  case  that  a  Joint  Venture  partner  says  to  an  Employer:  \u201cnot my problem, discuss with \nthe other Joint Venture partner\u201d or \u201caccording to the Joint Venture agreement this is not my responsibility.\u201d \nBased  on  the  above,  Employers  should  not  be  misled  by  these  kinds  of  statements.  The  internal \narrangements  of  the  Joint  Venture  members,  through  their  Joint  Venture  agreement,  and  the \ndelineation of responsibilities they choose among themselves are none of the Employer\u2019s concern and \ncannot be opposed to the Employer. Whenever there is a wrongdoing under the contract, the Joint \nVenture as a whole and each of its members are liable to the Employer regardless of whether a Joint \nVenture  member  is  a  minority  partner,  has  completed  his/her  own  duties  under  the  Joint  Venture \nAgreement, or limited his/her liability under the latter. Again, the Joint Venture Agreement is not a \nlegal instrument which can be opposed to the Employer.\n\n\fHOW TO CONDUCT THE BID EVALUATION\n\n51\n\nBased on the legal remedies which are already available to the Employer under the General Conditions of Contract, \nthis Standard Bidding Document does not favor any particular arrangement (Joint Venture or single entity) and \naccordingly  does  not  set  any  kind  of  negative  adjustment  in  the  bid  evaluation  process  for  a  Joint  Venture  as \nopposed to a single entity bidding alone. \n\nNotwithstanding the above, Employers may consider adopting procurement measures to favor the recruitment \nof single entities against Joint Venture, provided that solid justifications are given to support such decision. Such \nsituations will be reviewed by ADB on a case\u2013by\u2013case basis.\n\n\f52\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nterms of reference for  \nDBO Bid Evaluation Committee\n\nAll terms and expressions used below shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under the bidding document \n(hereinafter referred to as the \u201cBidding Document\u201d) for the [state name of DBO Contract for which Bids are invited]\n\n1.

qualify Bidders if the bidding was not preceded by a \nprequalification exercise and post qualification is applied. If prequalification is undertaken by the Employer, the qualification criteria \nset out under that Section should be used.\n\nADB requires Bidders to be qualified by meeting predefined, precise minimum requirements. The method entails setting pass\u2013fail \ncriteria, which, if not met by the Bidder, results in disqualification.\n\nIt will therefore be necessary to ensure that a Bidder\u2019s risk of having its bid rejected on grounds of qualification is remote if due \ndiligence is exercised by the Bidder during bid preparation. For that purpose, clear-cut, pass\u2013fail qualification criteria need to be \ndefined and indicated in the Invitation for Bids and the Bidding Document to enable Bidders to make an informed decision whether \nto pursue a specific Contract and, if so, whether to pursue it as a single entity or in Joint Venture. The criteria adopted must relate to \ncharacteristics that are essential to ensure satisfactory execution of the Contract, and must be stated in clear terms. In accordance \nwith ITB 31, ITB 35, and ITB 37, no other methods, criteria, and factors shall be used. \n\nThe Bidder shall provide all the information requested in the forms included in Section 4 (Bidding Forms). In case the bidding \nwas preceded by a prequalification process, updating of information pertaining to a Bidder\u2019s eligibility, historical contract \nnonperformance, and financial situation will be necessary during bidding.\n\n\fEVALUATION AND QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\n97\n\n1.\u2002Qualification\n\n1.1\u2003Eligibility\n\n1.1.1\u2003nationality\n\n1.1.2\u2003Conflict of Interest\n\n1.1.3\u2003ADB eligibility\n\nCriteria\n\nCompliance requirements\n\nDocuments\n\njoint Venture\n\nrequirement\n\nsingle entity\n\nAll Partners \nCombined\n\nEach \nPartner\n\nOne \nPartner\n\nsubmission \nrequirements\n\nNationality in accordance with ITB\u00a0 \n4.2.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nForms ELI \u2013 1; \nELI\u00a0\u2013 2 with \nattachments\n\nNo conflicts of interest in accordance \nwith ITB\u00a0 4.3.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nLetter of \nTechnical Bid\n\nNot having been declared ineligible by \nADB, as described in ITB 4.4.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nLetter of \nTechnical Bid\n\n1.1.4\u2003government-Owned enterprise\n\nBidder required to meet conditions of \nITB 4.5.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nForms                  \nELI - 1; ELI - 2\nwith \nattachments\n\n1.1.5\u2003united nations eligibility\n\nNot having been excluded by an \nact of compliance with a United \nNations Security Council resolution in \naccordance with ITB 4.8.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nLetter of \nTechnical Bid\n\n\f98\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n1.2\u2003Historical Contract Nonperformance\n\n1.2.1\u2002History of nonperforming Contracts\n\nCriteria\n\nCompliance requirements\n\nDocuments\n\njoint Venture\n\nrequirement\n\nsingle entity\n\nAll Partners \nCombined\n\nEach \nPartner\n\nOne \nPartner\n\nsubmission \nrequirements\n\nNonperformance of a contracta\ndid not occur as a result of \ncontractor default since 1 January \n[insert year].\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirementb\n\nNot \napplicable\n\nForm CON-1\n\na\u2002 Nonperformance, as decided by the Employer, shall include all contracts where (a) nonperformance was not challenged by the \ncontractor, including through referral to the dispute resolution mechanism under the respective contract, and (b) contracts that \nwere so challenged but fully settled against the contractor.

Indeed, a Bidder could be tempted to artificially come up with a low Operation Service price in his/her bid, which \nwould make that, when this low Operation Service is extrapolated over the life span of the facility (for the sake of bid evaluation \nonly), it would give him/her an undue competitive advantage. \n\nAs an example, assume that:\n\n\u2022\t the DB component of the facility is meant to be worth 50, and\n\n\u2022\t the O component is meant to be worth 50 over 25 years, hence 2 per year,\n\nthen a prudent Bidder for a 5-year operation DBO Contract would bid for 50 (DB) + 2 x 5 (2 of Operation Service per year \nmultiplied by 5 years) = 60.\n\nA Bidder trying to take advantage of the whole life cycle cost formula for bid evaluation could come up with an O&M price of say \n0.5 instead of 2.\n\nThis would make that:\n\n\u2022\t his/her Contract Price is 50 (DB) + 0.5 x5 (O&M) = 52.5, and\n\n\u2022\t the whole life cycle cost evaluation of his/her bid, over 25 years (life span of the facility) is 50 (DB) + 0.5x25 (O&M) = 62.5 \n\nwhere a prudent Bidder would come up with 100.\n\nOne may argue that the DBO Contractor would then have to suffer from the consequences of having a low Operation Service \nprice, possibly lower than the actual cost, hence why would he/she do this?

In the example above, the Bidder could bring \nhis/her DB price from 50 to 57.5 to compensate the loss of 7.5 on the 5-years of O&M period under the Contract. The whole life \ncycle cost evaluation of his/her bid would give, as a result: 57.5 (DB) + 0.5x25 (O&M) = 70, which is still more competitive than \nthe prudent Bidder coming up at 100, and without any financial loss for the clever Bidder. \n\nBy applying this approach, the clever Bidder would indeed take advantage of the whole life cycle cost evaluation formula for \ngetting an undue competitive advantage since, all things being equal, i.e., assuming the hypothetical case where 2 bids are \nexactly the same and coming from 2 equally competent and experienced Bidders, that clever Bidder would get such competitive \nadvantage (70 instead of 100\u2014hence 30 artificially \u201ccheaper\u201d than the prudent Bidder) just by spreading his/her Bid price in \nsuch a way which allows him/her to take full advantage of the formula. However, once the DBO Contract is completed, this is the \nEmployer who will have to bear the real O&M cost of 2 per year. The table above illustrates this issue, showing that:\n\n\u2022\t despite the same nominal Bid Price between Bid 1 and Bid 2;\n\n\u2022\t Bid 2 wins based on the whole life cycle cost approach, as abused by Bidder 2 since it misrepresents to the Employer that it \n\nwill nominally amount to 70 while it should actually be 100 i.e., same as for Bid 1; and\n\n\u2022\t while Bid 2 actually ends up being a most expensive solution than Bid 1, on a present value comparison basis.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nOne remedy for this situation could be to define a threshold (such as when the Operation Service period is less than 5 years for \nexample) below which the whole life cycle cost evaluation would not apply. However, this would bring the Employer back to the \nusual problem of DB contracts: having a Bidder coming in with an aggressive/low Bid price for the DB component, and not being \nbothered by the possible high Operation Service costs in the long run since those would be financially borne by the Employer. This \nis illustrated under the table above, where the low CAPEX/high OPEX Bid gets selected although it proves to cost more to the \nEmployer over the life cycle of the facility.\n\nAll in all, the Employer could find itself trapped in between the two following adverse situations for short Operation Service \nPeriods:\n\n1)  Applying the whole life cycle cost approach, and having the risk of a Bidder artificially increasing the Design\u2013Build \n\ncomponent of his/her Bid price, and artificially decreasing the Operation Service component of his/her Bid price, to take \nan undue advantage of the Bid evaluation methodology.\n\n\f112\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n2)  Not applying the whole life cycle cost approach, and having the usual Design\u2013Build Contracts risk of a Bidder going for \na cheap Design\u2013Build option, which would prove to be expensive on the Operation Service side. He/she would be more \ncompetitive, hence would be selected against a higher CAPEX/lower OPEX alternative Bid, hence depriving the Employer of \nthe benefit of such latter Bid which brings higher economic benefits for the Employer over the life span of the facility.\n\nThe whole life cycle costs evaluation is the method which makes the utmost economic sense for the Employer in the long run, hence \nit is recommended to the Employer to keep using it even with short Operation Service Periods but, in such cases, to strengthen the \nperformance damages associated to the Operation Service expenditure to avoid the said bias.\n\nIndeed, as an example, the Operation Service Price on WTP and WWTP is prominently determined by two factors as follows:\n\n- \n\nthe payment the Employer will make to the Contractor for the electricity consumption, which derives from the Guaranteed \nMaximum Energy Consumption Rate which the Contractor commits to with his/her Bid, and\n\n- \n\nthe chemical consumption costs incurred.\n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\nThe Contract already provides for severe consequences to the Contractor in case he/she breaches his/her obligation as to the \nGuaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate:\n\nduring the Operation Service Period, the Contractor will not be reimbursed of any electricity paid for in excess to that \nguaranteed maximum consumption\u2014see Appendix 1 of the PCC Part B and\n\nthe Contractor will be liable to pay the additional cost that breach will generate to the Employer over the residual life span of \nthe facility beyond the Contract completion, as per the performance damages mechanism laid down under GCC Subclause \n11.11 [Failure to Pass Tests Prior to Contract Completion] and under Appendix 2 to the PCC Part B. \n\nIt is recommended to the Employer to apply the same mechanism for chemicals, hence:\n\nrequiring the Contractor to commit on Guaranteed Maximum Chemical Consumption Rates\u2014this will require amending the \nSchedule of Performance Guarantees and setting up a new Price Schedule (5.4) under Price Schedule 5\u2014see the guidance \nnote to that effect under Section 4 of this Bidding Document, Preamble to the Price Schedules.\n\ndeveloping the same payment mechanism (under Appendix 1 to the PCC Part B) and the same performance damages \nmechanism (under Appendix 2 to the PCC Part B) as applied for electricity. \n\nAs a corollary to the above, in case of short Operation Service Periods, and in order to avoid any distortion of/bias to the whole \nlife cycle costs Bid evaluation methodology, the Employer should require guarantees from the Contractor as to electricity and \nchemicals consumption rates, which are the two highest cost items in the operation of a WTP or WWTP, and should develop \nin the Contract the relevant payment deductions during the Operation Service Period, and performance damages upon its \ncompletion. This would in effect act as a deterrent to the Contractor to propose artificially low Operation Service Prices, as \nthis would make him/her otherwise suffer from severe financial consequences.\n\n2.2.3\u2002Contractor\u2019s Overhead and Profit for Compensation events\n\nMultiply the Bidder\u2019s proposed percentages in the Schedule of overhead and profit to the Bid amount for \nthe Design\u2013Build of Works (which is the sum of Price Schedules Nos. 1 to 4), and add this to the Bid price \nfor evaluation.\n\nnOte\n\nDefining such overhead and profit components under the Contract is found to be a positive measure, which will \ncontribute to avoid practical difficulties in contract administration when it comes to valuating claims and Variations.\n\nOwing to the long-term contractual arrangement at stake, and the risk profile borne by the Contractor under \nthis DBO Contract for the benefit of the Employer, it is found preferable to leave it to the Contractor to set such \npercentages.\n\nThis will furthermore enable the Employer to benefit from competitive overhead and profit percentage proposal from \nthe Bidder, since the percentages selected will have an impact on the economic evaluation of the Bid.\n\n\fEVALUATION AND QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\n113\n\n2.2.4\u2002Work, services, facilities, etc., to Be Provided by the employer\n\nWhere  Bids  include  the  undertaking  of  work  or  the  provision  of  services  or  facilities  by  the  Employer  in \nexcess of the provisions allowed for in the Bidding Document, the Employer shall assess the costs of such \nadditional work, services and/or facilities during the duration of the Contract, and factor for those when \ncalculating the whole life cycle costs under the preceding part. Such costs shall be added to the Bid price \nfor evaluation.\n\n2.2.5\u2002Domestic Preference\n\nIf domestic preference applies as per BDS 41.1, then the following shall apply. Otherwise, there shall be no \nBid price adjustment on the account of domestic preference.\n\nA domestic preference will be granted to eligible domestically produced Plant and Materials in accordance \nwith the following provisions:\n\n(a)  The preference margin shall not be applied to the whole facility but only to the eligible domestically \n\nproduced Plant and Materials within the

Schedule No. 2).\n\n(c)  All other cost components for services and works such as costs for design, local handling, transportation, \nstorage,  installation,  commissioning,  operation,  and  asset  replacement  shall  be  quoted  separately \n(Section 4, Bidding Forms, Schedule No. 3 to No. 7).\n\n(d)  In the comparison of Bids, only the CIP price component of each Bid for the Plant and Materials offered \n\nfrom outside the Employer\u2019s country shall be increased by 15%.\n\n(e)  No domestic preference shall be applied to any of the services or works included in the Contract.\n\n(f)  Bidders shall not be permitted or required to modify the mix of local and foreign Plant and Materials \n\nafter Bid opening.\n\n2.2.6\u2002specific Additional Criteria\n\nThe

Typically, this will cover the following, without necessarily being limited to, Contractor\u2019s cost items:\n\n(a)  Maintenance and replacement, for all aspects not covered by the Asset Replacement Fund according \n\nto the provisions of GCC Subclause 14.18;\n\n(b)  Personnel (administration, management, etc.);\n\n(c)  Facilities (offices, warehouses, accommodation, workshops, etc.);\n\n(d)  Equipment;\n\n(f)  Overheads and profit.\n\n(e) \n\nInsurances, guarantees, financial services, support services; and\n\n14. \n\n Schedule 5.2 reflects variable fees which are deemed to cover the expenses incurred by the Contractor for \nproviding the Operation Service and which vary depending on the actual production output of the treatment \nplant. Typically, this will cover the following, without necessarily being limited to, Contractor\u2019s cost items:\n\n(a)  Maintenance and replacement, for all aspects not covered by the Asset Replacement Fund according \n\nto the provisions of GCC Subclause 14.18;\n\n(b)  Chemicals;\n\n(d)  Facilities.\n\n(c)  Personnel (management, operation, etc.); and\n\n15. \n\n Schedule 5.3 reflects prices to be paid to the Contractor for the electricity he/she will use for the Operation \nService Period and which he/she will pay to the local grid/power supplier. This is based on\n\n(a) \n\nthe average energy tariff prior to bidding stage, which will be filled in by the Employer; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n16. \n\nthe forecast production of the plant, in m3, over the years of the Operation Service Period, also filled in \nby the Employer; and\n\nthe Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate, which is the maximum consumption of energy \nper m3 of production as committed by the Bidder through the Schedule of Performance Guarantees.\n\n As per the Schedule of Payments, appended to the Particular Conditions of Contract, the Employer bears the \nrisk of the electricity tariff fluctuation but only up to the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption. If the \nfacility designed, built, and operated by the Contractor proves to consume more energy per m3 of production \nthan the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate, the cost of electricity in excess of that Rate shall \nbe borne by the Contractor. However, if the Contractor manages to achieve lower consumption rates than \nguaranteed under the Contract, the annual electricity cost savings this will generate to the Employer will be \nequally shared in between the Parties.\n\n\fBIDDING FORMS\n\n125\n\nnOte\n\nSplitting the Operation Service payment in between fixed and variable fees brings the required flexibility to deal with all production \nsituations which may occur due to, for example, different water supply demands or wastewater inflows than anticipated by \nthe Employer based on the Feasibility Study, since under DBO Contracts the Contractor does not bear the commercial risk of \nthe facility. If the facility produces less than anticipated for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor, a fair and reasonable \nmechanism must be in place to make sure he/she is paid for his/her fixed fees.\n\nInternational experience shows that it is preferable for the Employer to bear the risk of electricity tariff fluctuations in DBO \nContracts for water and wastewater treatment plants. The same principle can be extrapolated to other kind of water and \nwastewater infrastructure. This would otherwise lead to adverse risk premiums which would negatively impact the Contract Price. \nThe Contractor is on the other hand required to contractually commit to what he/she can reasonably control\u2014the maximum \nenergy consumption rate per m3 of production. \n\nAn incentive is also provided to the Contractor for endeavouring to do better than contracted in term of energy consumption \nrate. A lower rate will bring savings to the Employer as he/she will pay less electricity costs than he/she would have had to if the \nelectricity consumption was at the level of the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate. Such savings are shared with the \nContractor, to align the Employer and the Contractor\u2019s objectives through such win-win arrangement.\n\nIt should be noted that the Employer may wish to apply the same principles for chemicals consumption, since it is another major \ncost item within the operating expenditure of a facility. Indeed, the Employer may then wish to:\n\n\u2022\t bear the risk of the relevant chemical tariff fluctuation but only up to the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption;\n\n\u2022\t make the Contractor liable for cost overrun in case the actual chemical consumption exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum \n\nChemical Consumption defined by the Contractor in his/her bid; and\n\n\u2022\t share the savings made by the Employer in case the relevant chemical consumption falls below the relevant Guaranteed \n\nMaximum Consumption Rate, as an incentive for the Contractor to do better than committed in his/her Bid and in Contract.\n\nIn such case, the Employer should:\n\n\u2022\t Introduce a Schedule 5.4, in similar terms as those used under Schedule 5.3 for electricity.\n\n\u2022\t Amend Schedule 5 to accommodate for an additional column reflecting the Contractor\u2019s Chemicals Payment, which will \n\ncapture price data flowing from Schedule 5.4.\n\n\u2022\t Insert Key Performance Indicators related to chemicals, if and as need be under the Employer\u2019s Requirements (section 4 \n\nthereunder) and the Schedule of Performance Guarantees.\n\n\u2022\t Amend the PCC Part B Appendix 1 and 2 to introduce similar terms for chemicals payment and performance damages as \n\nthe ones used for electricity payment and performance damages.\n\nThe attention of the Employer is drawn to the fact that introducing too many constraints to the Bidders on Guaranteed \nMaximum Chemical Consumption Rates can lead to the adverse result that the design and engineering added values of the \nBidders are undermined. The more maximum consumption rates are defined by the Employer (for example with a WTP: on \naluminium sulphate, organic polymers, chlorine, ozone, etc.), the less flexibility Bidders will have to propose their most fit for \npurpose design solution meeting the Employer\u2019s Requirements. As much as possible, the Employer should resist the temptation \nof becoming too prescriptive on such matters, as otherwise the Employer will progressively lose the full strength of the DBO \nprocurement process and contracting arrangement. It might indeed well be that one design and engineering solution would, for \nexample, exceed a Key Performance Indicator maximum value introduced for chemicals, and would then have to be discarded, \ndespite being a more attractive solution on capital expenditure and on energy expenditure under a whole life cycle costs approach \nthan a solution being fully compliant with over-prescriptive Employer\u2019s Requirements. \n\nUnder the latter approach, matters such as capital and operating expenditure should not be considered in isolation, but \nalways under an integrated manner. Accordingly, Key Performance Indicators can be introduced for energy and/or chemical \nconsumptions, but care should be given before setting a KPI maximum value. Nothing indeed prevents the Employer to introduce \na KPI with no imposed maximum value, hence for which full flexibility is given to the Bidder to set in his/her Bid the guaranteed \nvalue he/she deems suitable. That is the guaranteed value which will be monitored during the Contract implementation, and any \nexcess to that value will make the Contractor subject to nonpayment under Appendix 1 of the PCC Part B, and/or performance \ndamages under Appendix 2 of the PCC Part B.\n\n\f126\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nasset replacement Fund and Schedule\n\n17. \n\n The Contractor will be responsible to proceed with Asset Replacement during the Operation Service Period, \nbased on the Asset Replacement Schedule inserted in the Price Schedule 7.1 and through the financing of \nthe Asset Replacement Fund inserted in the Price Schedule 7, all in accordance with the provisions of the \nGCC Subclause 14.5 [Asset Replacement Schedule] and 14.18 [Asset Replacement Fund].\n\nnOte\n\nThe Contractor will be liable for any Asset Replacement occurring earlier than anticipated in the Asset Replacement Schedule, \nsince payment will not be made to the Contractor before the date stated in such Schedule, in accordance with the provisions of \nGCC Subclause 14.5.\n\nSavings against the Asset Replacement Fund, at the end of the Operation Service Period, will be determined and shared in \nbetween the Parties as per the procedure defined in the GCC Subclause 14.18.

Indeed, various production conditions can lead to different cost structures. \nConsequently, there can be several sets of Schedules 5.2 and 5.3 (and 5.4, if any) that can be used by the Bidder to reflect the \nspecificities of this process.

Its \noperation is governed by the terms of GCC Subclause 14.5 and Subclause 14.18 and further explained as follows:\n\n\u2022\u2002\tAt\tbidding\tstage,\tthe\tBidder\twill\tdefine\tan\tAsset\tReplacement\tSchedule,\twhich\tis\treflected\tunder\tthe\tPrice\tSchedule\t7.1\t\nabove. This Asset Replacement Schedule sets, for each major asset within the facility, when its replacement is scheduled \nover the Operation Service Period. A price is reflected in the Bid for that replacement at that scheduled date. In effect, \nthis means the Bidder represents to the Employer that that asset will not have to be replaced before the replacement date \ninserted by the Bidder under the Asset Replacement Schedule, and, when it is to be replaced, the Employer will have to \npay the price stated in the Bid for that replacement.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tAccordingly,\tfrom\tthe\tEmployer\u2019s\tperspective,\tthe\tasset\treplacement\tis\tset\tin\ttime\tand\tprice\tfrom\tthe\toutset\tof\tthe\t\n\nContract implementation, as follows:\n\no\u2002 the Bidder who becomes Contractor will be paid the price he/she filled in his/her Bid (and which now forms part \n\nof the Contract), whatever the actual cost of the replacement is when replacement is to be made, i.e., whether the \nactual cost is higher or lower than the price in the Bid does not make any difference\u2014the Contractor remains paid \nthat price;\n\no\u2002 the Bidder who becomes Contractor will be paid the price he/she filled in his/her Bid (and which now forms part \nof the Contract) if the replacement date scheduled in the Asset Replacement Schedule is met, and when the \nreplacement is actually made. Consequently, if an asset is to be replaced earlier than scheduled (for whatever \nreason, such as a defect in the manufacturing of the asset, or improper operation and maintenance practices), then \nno payment is made to the Contractor until such time the scheduled replacement date occurs. The Contractor \ntherefore suffers from the cash flow consequences of having to replace an asset earlier than what he/she declared in \nthe Contract, for the period ranging from the actual date of replacement until the date set in the Asset Replacement \nSchedule. \n\no\u2002 On the other hand, if a replacement turns out to be required later than the date set in the Asset Replacement \n\nSchedule (for various reasons, such as a better life expectancy than envisaged caused by design or operation and \nmaintenance practices optimization), then replacement payment is only done when the replacement is actually \nmade, and not at the date set in the Asset Replacement Schedule.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tAll\tsums\tto\tbe\tpaid,\tas\tper\tthe\tAsset\tReplacement\tSchedule,\tare\tthen\tconsolidated\ton\ta\tyearly\tbasis\tin\tthe\tAsset\t\n\nReplacement Fund (Price Schedule 7) which summarizes payment the Employer is planned to make on a yearly basis for \nall asset replacement under the Contract.\n\n\u2022\u2002Note\tthat\tthe\tAsset\tReplacement\tFund\tdoes\tnot\tcover\tthe\tcosts\tof:\n\no\u2002 routine maintenance items associated with the correction of defects;\n\no\u2002 replacement of Plant and Materials, which have a life expectancy of less than five years, which explains why the \n\nAsset Replacement Fund and Schedule start at Year 6 into the Operation Service Period;\n\no\u2002 providing spares between scheduled dates for major plant replacement; and/or\n\no\u2002 the replacement of Plant and Materials which are not identified in the Asset Replacement Schedule.\n\nAll such costs are deemed to be covered by the Price Schedule 5\u2014Operation Service.\n\nAs can be seen from the above, this mechanism provides the Employer with an early price certainty as to the cost of asset \nreplacement over the Operation Service Period under the Contract.\n\n\fBIDDING FORMS\n\n145\n\nAn example to further illustrate this mechanism is as follows:\n\n\u2022\u2002Assume\ta\ttreatment\tplant\tbased\ton\tmembrane\tprocesses,\twith\ta\t12-year\tOperation\tService\tPeriod.\n\n\u2022\u2002The\tContractor,\tthrough\tthe\tAsset\tReplacement\tSchedule,\tdeclared\tthe\tplanned\treplacement\tof:\n\no\u2002a first set of cartridge filters in the 6th year into the Operation Service Period,\n\no\u2002a second set in the 8th year, and\n\no\u2002a set of dosing pumps and actuators in the 11th year.\n\n\u2022\u2002During\tthe\tOperation\tService\tPeriod,\tthe\tfollowing\toccurs:\n\no\u2002 The first set of cartridge filters is to be replaced in the 5th year, hence earlier than in Contract, and for a higher cost \nto the Contractor than the price set in the Asset Replacement Schedule and Fund. The Contractor will only get paid \nin the 6th year, and only of the price set in the Asset Replacement Schedule and Fund. Accordingly, the Contractor \nsuffers from a cost overrun (the difference in between the actual replacement cost, and the replacement price in \nContract), and from a payment 1 year later than when the replacement costs are actually incurred. \n\no\u2002 The second set of cartridge filters is to be replaced in the 8th year, right as per what was planned in the Asset \n\nReplacement Schedule. Replacement cost is lower than the replacement price set in Contract. Nevertheless, the \nContractor gets paid of that price and benefits from the savings, i.e., from the difference in between price set in \nContract and the actual replacement cost.\n\no\u2002 Dosing pumps and actuators are to be replaced in the 12th year, hence a year later than set in the Asset \n\nReplacement Schedule, and for a cost corresponding to the price set in Contract. The Contractor does not get paid \nas per the date set in the Asset Replacement Schedule, i.e., in the 11th year, but when the replacement is actually \ndone, i.e., in the 12th year.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tPrior\tto\tissuance\tof\tthe\tContract\tCompletion\tCertificate,\ta\tcomparison\tis\tmade\tbetween\tthe\tactual\tdepreciation\tof\t\nthe assets listed in the Asset Replacement Schedule, against the depreciation which was initially expected under the \nSchedule. Assets which had to be replaced later than planned generate a gain for the Employer since asset depreciation \nis lower than expected, while those which had to be replaced earlier generate a loss owing to a higher depreciation \nmechanism. Corresponding payment liabilities and incentives are defined under Appendix 1 to the PCC Part B\u2014please \nrefer to the guidance note thereunder for further explanation.\n\n\f146\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nschedule no. 8: grand summary\n\nSchedule \nNo.\n\ntitle\n\ntotal Pricea\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nPlant and Mandatory Spare Parts Supplied from Abroadb\n\nPlant and Mandatory Spare Parts Supplied from Within the \nEmployer\u2019s Countryb\n\nDesign Services\n\nInstallation and other services during the Design\u2013Build \nPeriod\n\nSum of (1) \nto (4)\n\nSubtotal for the Design\u2013Build of the Works, to be carried \nforward to the Letter of Bid\n\nOperation Service\n\nOther Services During the Operation Service Period\n\n(5)+(6)\n\nSubtotal for the Operation Service, to be carried forward to \nthe Letter of Bid\n\nAsset Replacement Fund to be carried forward to Letter  \nof Bid\n\ngrand total to be carried forward to letter of Bid\n\nName of Bidder ____________________________\n\nSignature of Bidder __________________________\n\na\u2003Specify currency in accordance with ITB 19.1 of the BDS.

This is also used under the Appendix 2 \n[Performance Damages] of the PCC Part B, where any remaining failure by the Contractor to meet this KPI will expose him/\nher to pay to the Employer, in case of failure to pass the Tests Prior to Contract Completion, the additional electricity cost \nwhich will be suffered by the Employer over the remaining life span of the facility after completion of the Operation Service \nPeriod and of the Contract. \n\nThe Guaranteed Maximum Chemical Consumption Rate reflects another major operating expenditure, which should be \nconsidered for use by the Employer. Key Performance Indicators can be introduced for chemical consumptions, but care should \nbe given before setting a KPI maximum value for the reasons laid down in the Guidance Note under the Preamble of the Price \nSchedules. Nothing indeed prevents the Employer to introduce a KPI with no imposed maximum value, hence for which full \nflexibility is given to the Bidder to set in his/her Bid the guaranteed value he/she deems suitable. \n\nThe Employer can also leave the Bidders free to propose their own KPI for Chemicals consumption, since different processes \nmean different chemicals, and not all design solutions use the same range of chemicals.\n\nOther major inputs-based KPI can be added by the Employer in the table above, based on the project specific features. \n\nThe second table below reflect other KPIs which will apply throughout the Contract execution, and with which the \nContractor shall comply.\n\n\fBIDDING FORMS\n\n155\n\nOutputs-based KPI\n\nNo KPI name\n\nKPI \ndescription\n\nKPI [minimum \nof maximum] \nvalue\n\nKPI \ntolerance \n(if any)\n\nKPI measurement/ \ntesting methodology\n\nComment if any\n\nnOtes\n\nThe following example KPI can be selected by the Employer.\n\nFor a Water Treatment Plant:\n\n\u2022\u2002\tPlant\tproduction\tin\tm3/day or, with possible fluctuations depending on time (peak output to be reached during peak \n\ndemand period in a day) and seasons (hot season, seasonal population increase, etc.)\n\n\u2022\u2002\tOutput\twater\tquality\t(compliance\twith\tstandards\tdefined\tin\tthe\tEmployer\u2019s\tRequirements\tsuch\tas\tbacteriological\tcontents,\t\n\npH, chlorine, etc.)\n\n\u2022\u2002Noise\tlevels\n\n\u2022\u2002Management\tof\tby-products\u2014sludge\tproduction\tquantity\tand/or\tdryness\n\n\u2022\u2002Compliance\twith\tspecific\tlocal\tenvironmental\tlaws\tand\tregulations\t\n\nFor a Wastewater Treatment Plant:\n\n\u2022\u2002\tPlant\tcapacity\tin\tm3/day or, with possible fluctuations depending on time (peak output to be reached during peak demand \n\nperiod in a day) and seasons (hot season, rainy season, seasonal population increase, etc.)\n\n\u2022\u2002Effluent\tquality\t(compliance\twith\tstandards\tdefined\tin\tthe\tEmployer\u2019s\tRequirements\tsuch\tas\tBOD5, COD, SS, etc.)\n\u2022\u2002Noise\tlevels\n\n\u2022\u2002Odor\tlevels\n\n\u2022\u2002Management\tof\tbyproducts\u2014sludge\tdry\tsolids\tcontents,\tsludge\tquantity,\tetc.\n\n\u2022\u2002Compliance\twith\tspecific\tlocal\tenvironmental\tlaws\tand\tregulations\n\nIt is for instance common practice to reflect KPI on sludge production quantity and/or dryness for WWTP, since sludge \nmanagement is also a significant operating expenditure over the life span of a WWTP.

Failure to reach those will \nimpact the Contractor\u2019s payment under Appendix 1 [Schedule of Payments] to the Particular Conditions of Contract \nPart B, and will make the Contractor liable to pay damages to the Employer in accordance with the provisions of \nAppendix 2 [Performance Damages] to the Particular Conditions of Contract Part B, GCC Subclause 10.7 [Failure to \nReach Production Outputs] and GCC Subclause 11.11 [Failure to Pass Tests Prior to Contract Completion]. \n\nFor the purpose of calculating performance damages, the Contractor is fully aware that the life span expectancy of \nthe facility is as follows: \n\nLife span expectancy of the facility to be designed, built, \nand operated by the Contractor under the Contract\n\n(data to be filled in by the Employer) years\n\nnOtes\n\nThe Employer should fill in above the life span expectancy sought for the facility.\n\nFor example, it is common practice to refer to a 20 to 30-year expected life span for a Water Treatment Plant or a Wastewater \nTreatment Plant. Civil works (basins, tanks, etc.) have generally a life span expectancy of 50 years, while electrical and \nmechanical equipment are more in the range of 10 to 20 years, and it is recommended to set the life span expectancy of the \nfacility as being a period going over the life span expectancy of most of the electrical and mechanical equipment.\n\n Overall, 25 years for a plant is considered reasonable and in line with international practice since over that period the \nnecessary technology upgrades made (to cope with science, technology, practices, legal and regulatory environment \nevolutions) are likely to make it that the resulting plant has little to be compared to the initial plant as designed and built by \nthe Contractor.\n\nThe life span expectancy filled in by the Employer will serve the purpose of calculating the whole life cycle cost of the facility \nbased on the Contractor\u2019s Price Bid, as per Section 3 of this Bidding Document, as well as performance damages under \nAppendix 2 of the Particular Conditions of Contract Part B.\n\nName of Bidder ____________________________\n\nSignature of Bidder __________________________\n\n\fBIDDING FORMS\n\n157\n\nBid Security\n\nBank Guarantee\n\n[insert bank\u2019s name, and address of issuing branch or office]1\n\nName of Contract/Contract No.  \n\n \n\n    __________________________________\n\nName and address of Beneficiary (\u201cthe Employer\u201d): ___________________________________\n\nWe have been informed that [name of the Contractor] (hereinafter called the \u201cPrincipal\u201d) is submitting a Bid for \nthe above-named Contract in response to your invitation, and the instructions to Bidders (hereinafter \u201cthe \nITB\u201d) require that this Bid is supported by a Bid Security.\n\nAt the request of the Principal, we [name of bank] hereby irrevocably undertake to pay you, the Beneficiary/\nEmployer, any sum or sums not exceeding in total the amount of  [amount in words] [amount in figures] upon \nreceipt by us of your demand in writing with your written statement (in the demand) stating that:\n\n(a) \n\nthe  Principal  has,  without  your  agreement,  withdrawn  his/her  Bid  after  the  latest  time  specified  for  its \nsubmission and before the expiry of its period of validity, or \n\n(b) \n\nthe Principal has refused to accept the correction of errors in his/her Bid in accordance with the ITB, or\n\n(c)  you  awarded  the  Contract  to  the  Principal  and  he/she  has  failed  to  comply  with  Subclause  1.6  [Contract \n\nAgreement] of the Conditions of Contract, or\n\n(d)  you  awarded  the  Contract  to  the  Principal  and  he/she  has  failed  to  comply  with  Subclause  4.2  \n\n[Performance Security] or Subclause 4.2A [Parent Company Guarantee] of the Conditions of Contract.\n\nAny demand for payment must contain your signature(s) which must be authenticated by your bankers or by \na notary public.

The FIDIC Gold Book operates on the basis of three main levels of design, as defined in the FIDIC DBO \nContract Guide, 2011 Edition:\n\n1.\u2002 Conceptual design (if any) which might be included in the Employer\u2019s Requirements, and which consists of a simple layout \n\nwith possibly basic dimensions and defined criteria to identify the Works sufficiently for tenderers to be able to understand and \ndevelop the requirements in order to prepare a responsive tender. Note that setting a conceptual design, and possibly imposing \na base solution to be complied with by Bidders, is not mandatory and the Employer may only specify requirements to be \ncomplied with by Bidders (performance of the plant, etc.) and leave full flexibility to Bidders to freely propose their best fit-for-\npurpose design engineering solution.\n\n2.\u2002 Preliminary design of the technological solution proposed by the Bidders, and to be inserted in their Bid. The level of detail \n\nrequired in the preliminary design should be stated in the Bidding Document but it should be that necessary for the Employer to \nbe able to understand the Bid from the Bidder. Bidders should not be asked for an elaborate detailed design at this stage, since \nthis would be expensive to produce and a corresponding excessive economic burden for all except the successful Bidder.\n\n3.\u2002 Detailed/final design stage is that made by the Contractor as part of his/her obligations under the Contract. Unless any \n\nchanges have been agreed prior to the Contract award this will usually be a development of his/her preliminary design and will \nbecome a part of the Contractor\u2019s Documents (as defined under GCC Subclause 1.1.19).\n\nIt is fully recognized that different countries use different terminology and procedures for design, and it is down to the Employer \nto adapt the wording used above, and the various design stages, to fit the prevailing situation for the project, based on applicable \nlaws, regulations, and practices. \n\nNo specific format and structure is imposed for the Technical Proposal, however it is suggested, for ease of evaluation of the \nconformity of the Technical Proposal with the Employer\u2019s Requirements, that a similar structure to the latter is adopted by the \nBidder.\n\nThe Technical Proposal is expected to include as a minimum, though not being limited to, the following contractual warranties, \nrepresentations and statements of information:\n\n\u2022\u2002the\tdetails\tof\tthe\tContractor\u2019s\tproposed\tdesign\tengineering\tsolution\tfor\tthe\tplant;\n\n\u2022\u2002\tthe\tOperation\tand\tMaintenance\tPlan\tproposed\tby\tthe\tBidder\twhich\tfulfils\tthe\tOperation\tManagement\tRequirements\tcontained\t\n\nin the Employer\u2019s Requirements;\n\n\u2022\u2002the\tContractor\u2019s\tmethod\tstatements\tfor\tthe\tDesign\u2013Build\tPeriod;\n\n\u2022\u2002the\tBidder\u2019s\tproposed\tSite\torganisation;\n\n\u2022\u2002\tthe\tlist\tof\tproposed\tSubcontractors\tand\tSuppliers\tof\tPlant\tunder\tthe\tContract,\tin\tfurtherance\tto\tthe\tConditions\tof\tContract\t\n\nSubclause 4.4 and which have their origin in eligible source countries as defined under Section 5 of this Bidding Document.

design is to be done by the Contractor who is liable to deliver a facility which is fit for \nthe purposes intended under the Contract, and defined in these Employer\u2019s Requirements. Hence, this section called Employer\u2019s \nRequirements replaces the usual Technical Specifications section of a more traditional \u201cbuild-only\u201d approach, such as under the \nADB SBD for Works where it is the Employer, not the Contractor, who bears the design risk to the widest extent. \n\nTo enable Bidders to submit responsive bids and, subsequently, for the bids received to be evaluated in an equitable manner, \nthe Employer must make its requirements clear and precise. The Employer\u2019s requirements must therefore specify the exact \nrequirements of the completed facility. Beware that no extensive detailed technical specifications as to the way the facility is to \nbe designed, built, and operated shall be given, but only requirements to be met by the Contractor, using his/her own design, \nworkmanship and materials innovation, and added values.\n\nThis section should not contain commercial or Contract Conditions that are stipulated in other parts of the Bidding Document.\n\nFor an ADB-financed project to be procured through open competitive bidding (OCB) procedures, the Employer\u2019s Requirements \nmust be drawn up to permit the widest possible competition and, at the same time, present a clear statement of the required \nstandards of design, workmanship, materials, and performance of the facility.\n\nOnly if this is done will the objectives of economy and efficiency, fairness, and transparency in procurement be realized, \nresponsiveness of bids be ensured, and the subsequent task of bid evaluation facilitated. \n\nThe Employer\u2019s Requirements should stipulate that all Goods to be incorporated in the Works are new, unused, of the most recent \nor current models, and should incorporate the latest improvements in design and materials.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1.\u2003Introduction and Background

Design\u2013Build (DB) or Design\u2013Build\u2013Operate (DBO) Contract is that the Contractor designs a solution that \nmeets the Employer\u2019s Requirements and delivers Works which are fit for purpose. The Employer wants warranties on outputs and \nperformance, and shall not be bothered by detailing the means/inputs for reaching those. \n\nEmployer\u2019s Requirements under a DB or DBO Contract shall answer the question \u201cwhat are the outputs/performance \nexpected from the facility to be designed, built, and operated by the Contractor under the Contract?\u201d However, drafters of \nEmployer\u2019s Requirements should be careful and slow in attempting to answer the question \u201chow to reach those specified outputs \nand performance levels?\u201d That is for the Contractor to answer by means of his/her Bid and then throughout the Contract \nimplementation.\n\nAccordingly, the Employer shall resist the practice of being too prescriptive/specifying too extensively what is to be done by the \nContractor under the Contract. The more prescriptive the Employer\u2019s Requirements:\n\n\u2022\u2002\tThe\tless\troom\tfor\tthe\tContractor\tto\tdevelop\this/her\town\tengineering\tadded\tvalues,\tand\tto\tpropose\this/her\town\tengineering\t\n\nsolutions (including patented processes, as the case may be).

Details of those shall \nbe given in a Financing Memorandum which is to be attached as Appendix to the Employer\u2019s Requirements.\n\n2.\u2002Purpose of the Works \n\nThe purpose of the Works shall be defined here through a few generic lines which summarize the main functional expectations of \nthe Employer. Definition of the purpose of the Works must be performance-based. The essence, and strength from an Employer\u2019s \nperspective, of DB or DBO arrangements is that the Contractor is giving a contractual warranty that the Works, when delivered, \nwill be fit for purpose, and that they will continue to remain so during the Operation Service Period as per GCC Subclause 4.1 \n[Contractor\u2019s General Obligations].\n\nFor the sake of illustration only, the purpose could be defined as follows:\n\n\u201cA Water Treatment Plant, which is able to:\n\n\u2022\u2002\tDeliver\tXX\tm3/day of drinking water in accordance with the Contract and with applicable health, safety, and environmental \n\nlaws and regulations\n\n\u2022\u2002Operate\ton\ta\tcontinuous\tbasis\u201424\thours\tper\tday,\t7\tdays\tper\tweek\u2014without\tproduction\tinterruptions\n\n\u2022\u2002\tComply\twith\tthe\tkey\tperformance\trequirements\tdefined\tin\tthe\tEmployer\u2019s\tRequirements\tand\tin\tthe\tSchedule\tof\tPerformance\t\n\nnOtes\n\nnOtes\n\nGuarantees\n\n\u2022\u2002Etc.\u201d\n\nOr as follows:\n\n\u201cA water supply network which:\n\n\u2022\u2002Delivers\tto\tend\tusers\ta\tcontinuous\t(i.e.,\t24\thours\tper\tday,\t7\tdays\ta\tweek)\tsupply\tof\twater\t\n\n\u2022\u2002\tDelivers\twater\tof\tdrinking\tquality,\tin\taccordance\twith\tthe\tContract\tand\twith\tapplicable\thealth,\tsafety,\tand\tenvironmental\tlaws\t\n\nand regulations\n\n\u2022\u2002Has\ta\tminimum\tservice\tpressure\tof\tX\tbar\tat\tany\tpoint\tin\tthe\tnetwork\n\n\u2022\u2002Has\ta\tNonrevenue\tWater\tof\tless\tthan\tXX%\n\n\u2022\u2002Etc.\u201d\n\nFitness for purpose liability is a strict liability under most jurisdictions\u2014it means that, in case the Works are found not to be in \naccordance with their purpose, the Contractor will be presumed liable for that dysfunction. This is the Contractor who will have \nthe burden to prove that he/she is not liable (in case the Contractor believes that there are contractually valid reasons for excusing \nhim/her of his/her fitness for purpose obligation\u2014such as if the raw water to a Water Treatment Plant is of quality which differs \nfrom what was expected in the Employer\u2019s Requirements\u2014GCC Subclause 10.4 [Delivery of Raw Materials] would then relieve \nthe Contractor of his/her liability for the period during which raw water is not compliant with the Contract).\n\nDefining the purpose of the Works is at the root of a DB or DBO contractual arrangement, and there shall be no reasons for not \ndefining it in the Employer\u2019s Requirements.\n\n\fEMPLOYER\u2019S REQUIREMENTS\n\n185\n\n3.\u2002 Scope of the Design, Build,  \n\nand Operate Contract\n\nnOtes\n\nThe Employer shall summarize here the scope of the DBO Contract, by defining: \n\n\u2022\u2002\tThe\tgeneric\tsequence\tof\tactivities\tunder\tthe\tContract\u2014design,\tbuild,\tand\toperation\tphases\twith\tassociated\tmain\tfeatures\tsuch\t\nas timing and physical components of the Works. Once again, beware that the essence of a DB or DBO Contract is that the \nContractor designs a solution that meets the Employer\u2019s Requirements and is accordingly committed to outputs/performance. \nThe Employer shall resist the practice of being too prescriptive/specifying too extensively what is to be done by the Contractor, \nas this may inadvertently exclude what could otherwise be a suitable design engineering solution from the market.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tThe\tobjectives\tand\toutcomes\tto\tbe\tachieved\tthrough\tthe\tContract,\tin\trelation\twith\tthe\tIntroduction\tand\tBackground\tand\t\n\nwith the purpose of the Works as defined above (e.g., continuous and safe water supply to local population and businesses to \ncontribute to the socioeconomic development of the area, etc.).\n\n\u2022\u2002\tThe\tconsequences\tof\tthe\tnonachievement\tof\tthe\tobjectives\tand\toutcomes\texpected\tunder\tthe\tContract\u2014fines\tto\tthe\tEmployer\t\nfor breach of statutory duties, claims from consumers (for example, a business consumer claiming for a direct loss of factory \nproduction caused by an inadequate water supply), loss of reputation, etc. It is important to describe and represent to the \nContractor all the likely losses which may be suffered by the Employer in case the Contractor breaches the Contract, as this \nwould accordingly support, and be the basis for, loss and damages claims from the Employer under the Contract.\n\nThis section shall also define the design basis of the Works, and indicate if any base solution has been defined by the Employer \nand for which the Contractor shall comply with in his/her Bid. In which case, a specific section shall be developed under section \n5 below. Once again, the Employer should be slow in imposing an over-prescriptive design basis, since there are generally several \ndesign solutions to meet a set of performance requirements and those may then become excluded from the procurement process if \nthe design basis imposed is too prescriptive. It is not in the public interest of the project to deprive itself, without just cause, from \nmarket innovations and added values.\n\n\f186\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n4.\u2002Performance requirements\n\nnOtes\n\nThis section shall describe the outputs/performance which is to be achieved by the Works/facility once completed.\n\nIt shall be developed as a supporting and explanatory basis for the Schedule of Performance Guarantees, which is found under \nSection 4 of this Bidding Document and which will be filled in by the Contractor at bidding stage.\n\nThe Employer should accordingly define and develop here the key performance requirements to be set for the Works/facility\u2014\nfor example, the minimum water production to be delivered by the Water Treatment Plant in m3/day, the maximum energy \nconsumption rate in kWh/m3 of water produced by the plant, the maximum chemicals consumption rate (chlorine, aluminium \nsulphate, etc.) in kg/m3 of water produced, etc.\n\nKey performance requirements are typically those which have the greatest impact on the operating expenditure of the facility  \nand/or which are critical to verify that the facility is operating as per its intended purpose. They shall be measured by Key \nPerformance Indicators (KPI) for which the Employer should define:\n\n\u2022\u2002\tLimit\tvalues\t(minimum,\tmaximum)\tto\tbe\tcomplied\twith\tby\tthe\tContractor,\tand\tagainst\twhich\tthe\tContractor\twill\tcommit\tto\ta\t\n\nvalue through his/her Bid, and then under the Contract;\n\n\u2022\u2002\tPerformance\tdamages\tif\ta\tKPI\tmeasured\tvalue\tshows\tthat\tthere\tis\ta\tContractor\u2019s\tnon-excusable\tbreach\tof\tperformance\t\n\nguarantee. Those shall then be developed under commercial terms in Appendix 2 to the PCC; and\n\n\u2022\u2002\tMeasurement\tmethodology,\twhich\tshall\tbe\tdeveloped\tin\tgreat\tdetail\tin\tthis\tsection,\ttypically\tby\tspecifying:\n\no\u2002The measurement points under the Contract for the set KPI\n\no\u2002The regular calibration methodology to be complied with \n\no\u2002The measurement process  \n\nOwing to the severe contractual consequences of failure by the Contractor to meet performance requirements, since those are \nat the root of such contracts, great care should be given to ensure that measures are both reliable (tamper-proof, regularly \ncalibration) and easily verifiable. If need be, the Employer may consider the use of an independent third party, selected by both \nParties, for the setting-up and calibration of measurement points. \n\nExamples of KPI are given in the Schedule of Performance Guarantees under Section 4 of the Bidding Document. \n\nThe attention of the Employer is drawn to the fact that introducing too many constraints to the Bidders on Guaranteed Maximum \nChemical Consumption Rates can lead to the adverse result which is that the design and engineering added values of the Bidders \nare undermined. The more maximum consumption rates are defined by the Employer (for example with a WTP: on aluminium \nsulphate, organic polymers, chlorine, ozone, etc.), the less flexibility bidders will have to propose their most fit for purpose design \nsolution meeting the Employer\u2019s Requirements. As much as possible, the Employer should resist the temptation of becoming too \nprescriptive on such matters, as otherwise the Employer will progressively lose the full strength of the DBO procurement process \nand contracting arrangement. It might indeed well be that one design and engineering solution would, for example, exceed a KPI \nmaximum value introduced for chemicals, and would then have to be discarded although being an attractive solution on capital \nexpenditure and energy expenditure grounds under a whole life cycle costs approach. \n\nUnder the latter approach, matters such as capital and operating expenditure should not be considered in isolation, but always \nunder an integrated manner. Accordingly, KPI can be introduced for energy and/or chemical consumptions, but care should be \ngiven before setting a KPI maximum value. Nothing indeed prevents the Employer to introduce a KPI with no imposed maximum \nvalue, hence for which full flexibility is given to the Bidder to set in his/her Bid the guaranteed value he/she deems suitable. \nThat is then that guaranteed value which will be monitored during the Contract implementation, and any excess to that value \nwill make the Contractor subject to non-payment under Appendix 1 of the PCC Part B, and/or to performance damages under \nAppendix 2 of the PCC Part B.\n\n\fEMPLOYER\u2019S REQUIREMENTS\n\n187\n\n5.\u2002Design\u2013Build Period\n\n5.1\u2002Site Delineation, Use, access, and Possession Details\n\nnOtes\n\nThe following contents can be envisaged for this section:\n\n-\u2002 a general description of the location and boundaries of the project Site and a detailed description of the location of the parts \n\nof the Site that the Contractor will be granted possession of under Subclause 2.1 [Right of Access to the Site]. A plan or plans \nshould be attached, clearly showing these details for ease of identifying what is (and what is not) the Site\n\n-\u2002a description of all access restrictions which may affect the Site. For example: \n\no\u2002 any phased access to or possession of the Sections or to parts of the Site\u2013for example, areas that are dependent on Works being \n\ncompleted by other contractors such as piling or other ground improvement works; \n\no\u2002a part of the Site which is only available during certain periods of time which are to be specified;\n\no\u2002 a part of the Site which is under a specific security regime and where access will be limited to those within the Contractor\u2019s \nPersonnel who will have gone through a specific safety training organized by the Employer as detailed in the Contract,\n\no\u2002Etc.\n\n-\u2002 If any, a description of all approved access routes (indicating those which are shared or exclusive use routes) to the Site. A plan \nor plans clearly showing the access routes to the Site and dates of access should be attached. Note that such item of access \nroutes is only to be added if the Employer wishes to impose certain access routes to the Site, as otherwise the responsibility and \nliability of access route lies with the Contractor as per GCC Subclause 4.15 [Access Route]\n\n-\u2002 a description of approved locations for the Contractor\u2019s Site facilities (offices, warehouses, etc.), if the Contractor is authorized \n\nto have those on-Site. A plan clearly showing the locations should be attached\n\n-\u2002 a list of the Site arrangements, equipment, and/or facilities to be provided by the Contractor to the Employer (for example Site \noffices). This should include the standard and terms on which the facilities are to be provided and clarify who is responsible for \nthe payment of consumptions charges and connection fee for utilities etc.\n\n-\u2002 any other details relating to the Site, such as Site-wide policies and procedures, that the Contractor should be aware of (security \n\narrangements to be complied with and implemented by the Contractor, as per GCC Subclause 4.8 and 4.22 in particular, \ntransportation of personnel, handling and transportation of Goods on Site, disposal of construction waste, rubbish, and debris, \netc.).\n\n-\u2002 the description of any natural Materials which the Contractor is authorized to extract on and off the Site, and, if applicable, at \n\nwhat price and to be paid to whom.\n\n\f188\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n 5.2\u2002Site Data\n\nnOtes\n\nThis section shall list the relevant Site data to be taken into account by the Contractor when designing and building the Works.\n\n-\u2002 Subsurface conditions, based on geotechnical surveys carried out during project preparation, for identification of unstable \n\n-\u2002 Subsurface conditions shall also include any underground artificial obstructions such as utilities, culverts, drainage systems, etc.\n\n-\u2002 Hydrological conditions at Site (history of hydrological regime, flood records and magnitude for any body of water on or nearby \n\nThis shall typically detail the following:\n\nground or rocky ground \n\nthe Site, etc.)\n\n-\u2002Meteorological records\n\n-\u2002Topographical levels, benchmarks of reference required for the setting-out of the Works\n\nThose data will typically be used in conjunction with:\n\n-\u2002GCC Subclause 4.7 [Setting Out], \n\n-\u2002GCC Subclause 4.10 [Site Data], and\n\n-\u2002GCC Subclause 9.3, subparagraph (c)\u2013exceptionally adverse climatic conditions,\n\nand will assist the Contractor in drawing up the design options, as well as construction methods, stages, and expected progress \nwhich are relevant to such Site data.\n\nIt is recommended to define what will be considered as exceptionally adverse climatic conditions, in order to give a more objective \nreference, as otherwise this item, under GCC Subclause 9.3, remains vague and subject to contradictory points of view. In order \nto establish whether such climatic conditions occurred, it may be appropriate to compare the adverse climatic conditions with the \nfrequency with which events of similar adversity have previously occurred at or near the Site. An exceptional degree of adversity \nmight, for example, be regarded as one which has a probability of occurrence of four or five times the Time for Completion of \nDesign\u2013Build, which is the time within which the Contractor is to complete the Design\u2013Build activities under the DBO Contract.\n\nThe Employer shall then insert climatic conditions considered as adverse on the Site, such as intensity and duration of rainfall, \nwind speed, temperature, etc. as appropriate.\n\nLegally speaking, the data and information provided under this section is a representation made by the Employer as to the status \nof and conditions prevailing at Site. The Contractor is preparing a Bid, and will then be entering into the Contract, based on such \nrepresentation.\n\nAccordingly, in case the Contractor incurs Cost and/or suffers from delay because of errors in those, he/she will be entitled to \nclaim under the Contract for additional time and/or payment. This should however not refrain the Employer to provide such data \nand information, under the erroneous belief that the more data and information given, the more the Employer will be exposed to \nerrors hence claims. On the contrary:\n\n-\u2002 The less data and information, the higher uncertainty for the Contractor, the higher Contractor\u2019s risk premiums in his/her Bid, \n\nand the higher the Accepted Contract Amount\n\n-\u2002 If it can be proven that the Employer has deliberately withheld relevant data and information in his/her possession, this would \namount to a fraudulent misrepresentation. In such cases, the liability of the Employer toward the Contractor is much more \nsevere than for other breaches of Contract, since, as per GCC Subclause 17.8, the Contract does not limit the liability of a Party \nto the other in case of, inter alia, fraud or deliberate default.\n\nIt is accordingly in the best interest of the Employer and of the project that the Employer:\n\n-\u2002provides relevant data and information in his/her possession, and \n\n-\u2002 acquires, at project preparation stage and through relevant means (geotechnical surveys, topographical surveys, etc.) any data \n\ndeemed missing for the purpose of designing and executing the Works.\n\n\fEMPLOYER\u2019S REQUIREMENTS\n\n189\n\n5.3\u2002Interfaces\n\nnOtes\n\nDescribe to the widest and deepest possible extent all work of others than the Contractor (Employer\u2019s other contractors and \nconsultants, Employer\u2019s Personnel, etc.) which will interface with the activities of the Contractor under the Contract.\n\nThe more detailed this is, the less likely is the Contractor to claim for Unforeseeable Cost caused by interfaces under GCC \nSubclause 4.6 [Co-operation].\n\n5.4\u2002Sections and Phasing requirements\n\nnOtes\n\nThis section shall describe:\n\n-\u2002 Any Section which the Employer may consider using, and its associated Time for Completion. A Section is a physical part of the \nWorks (for instance, a sludge treatment line in a WWTP, a raw water pumping station at the inlet of a WTP, a DMA within a \nwater supply network, a water transmission main, etc.) for which the Employer wishes to set a different Time for Completion of \nDesign\u2013Build than for the rest of the Works\n\n-\u2002Any sequence/phasing of the design and build of the Works which the Contractor shall comply with\n\n-\u2002 Any intermediary progress milestones (in between Commencement Date and the Time for Completion of Design\u2013Build for \n\nthe whole of the Works\u2014for example a milestone for the production of an approved detailed design, of approved construction \ndrawings, for the completion of a particular structure on Site, etc.) to be complied with by the Contractor\n\nDesign and build progress milestones might be deemed relevant, typically in cases where phasing of the Design\u2013Build of the Works, \nor a Section, is required. \n\nUse of those is very widely spread in the construction industry, with specific delay damages which can be attached to key progress \nmilestones to act as a deterrent for the Contractor to miss those, in addition to the main milestone, which is to complete the \nwhole of the Works within the Time for Completion set in the Contract. However, for water and wastewater treatment plants, \nthis is not necessarily required since an Employer would typically look at having a plant running as per the Contract, and would \nnot necessarily be interested by any intermediary progress stage until such time the plant can operate as per its intended purpose. \nAgain, if this is deemed required for specific project purposes, then the use of such progress milestones could be introduced here and \ntheir associated delay damages, if any, reflected in the PCC. Legal expert advice is recommended to provide for PCC provisions \nwhich are relevant and enforceable.\n\n5.5\u2002Law, regulations, Codes, and Standards\n\nnOte\n\nDescribe those to be complied with by the Contractor during the Design\u2013Build Period under the Contract, in furtherance to \nthe provisions contained under GCC Subclause 1.14 [Compliance with Laws], GCC Subclause 5.4 [Technical Standards and \nRegulations].\n\n\f190\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n5.6\u2002Health, Safety, Environmental (HSE) and Social requirements\n\nnOtes\n\nDescribe those to be complied with by the Contractor during the Design\u2013Build Period under the Contract, typically in conjunction \nwith, but not limited to:\n\n-\u2002GCC Subclause 4.8 [Safety Procedures]\n\n-\u2002PCC Subclause 4.18 [Protection of the Environment]\n\n-\u2002PCC Subclause 4.26 [Compliance with ADB Safeguard Policy Statement]\n\n-\u2002PCC Subclause 6.1 [Engagement of Staff and Labour]\n\n-\u2002GCC Subclause 6.6 [Facilities for Staff and Labour]\n\n-\u2002PCC Subclause 6.7 [Health and Safety]\n\n-\u2002PCC Subclause 6.13 [Supply of Foodstuff]\n\nAttach compliance documents such as environmental management plan, resettlement action plan, safeguards monitoring report, \netc.\n\n5.7\u2002Permits and Licenses to Be Obtained by the Parties\n\nnOtes\n\nDescribe those to be obtained:\n\n-\u2002by the Employer, and\n\n-\u2002by the Contractor.\n\nIdeally in a tabulated format to make clear who is to obtain what under the Contract, how and under which sequence/timing, in \nparticular in conjunction with, but not limited to, GCC Subclause 1.14 [Compliance with Laws], GCC Subclause 2.2 [Permits, \nLicenses, or Approvals] or Clause 5 [Design].\n\n\fEMPLOYER\u2019S REQUIREMENTS\n\n191\n\n5.8\u2002Base Design Solution and Drawings \n\nnOtes\n\nIn case the Employer wishes to define a base design solution against which all Bidders shall bid, then this section shall be used to \ndetail to the Bidders the requirements they must comply with in their bids. Any outline/conceptual design drawing prepared by \nthe Employer shall then be attached to this section. \n\nOtherwise it shall be removed from the Employer\u2019s Requirements.\n\nAgain, the base solution shall be defined in such a way that allows Bidders to propose their design and engineering added values for \nthe benefit of the project, hence of the Employer. \n\nThe Contract is performance-based, and one its key strengths lies with the possibility it gives to Bidders to propose their own \ndesign and engineering solutions to meet the Employer\u2019s Requirements. This is for instance the only way for the Employer to attract \npatented processes from the private sector, as those cannot be specified in a Bidding Document. The Employer should accordingly \nbe mindful to resist the temptation to become over-prescriptive with any base solution he/she wishes to impose on Bidders. It is a \nwell-known fact that, for example, various design and engineering solutions exist in the market to deliver the expected treatment \nperformance for a WTP or WWTP. It is in the interest of the project and the communities it serves, hence of the Employer, to take \nfull advantage of the available market options, and that may not be achieved if the Employer becomes over-prescriptive on any \nbase solution it wishes to impose. For example, specifying an activated sludge process for a WWTP, and imposing location and size \nof aeration tanks and clarifiers would inevitably restrict the design flexibility of the Contractor, and the Employer must carefully \nconsider what can be its own benefit in doing so.\n\nEmployers should also be wary of the natural tendency of some Consultants who, under the influence of their own experience in \ntheir respective domestic market, are used to projects where Consultants design facilities to a wide extent, and Contractors are \nmerely builders of such design. In such instances, Contractors are not liable for the design hence are not contractually committed \nto the performance of the facility and do not give fitness for purpose warranties. Beware that such \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d practices are \ncontrary to the spirit and objectives of a DBO Contract, and should be avoided.\n\n5.9\u2002Contractor\u2019s Documents and Samples Submissions\n\nnOtes\n\nThis section shall describe:\n\n-\u2002 What are the Contractor\u2019s Documents to be submitted to the Employer\u2019s Representative, and for what: either consent or \n\napproval, as per GCC Subclause 5.2. These will typically include the design drawings, as well as the as-built documents under \nGCC Subclause 5.5 and the operation and maintenance manuals under GCC Subclause 5.6\n\n-\u2002The same applies for samples under GCC Subclause 7.2\n\nFor ease of reference, it is recommended to summarize those Contractor\u2019s Documents and samples in a tabulated list, using the \nfollowing columns:\n\n-\u2002 Column 3 \u2013 Item description (e.g., Process and Instrumentation Diagram of the Pumping Station, Detailed Design of the \n\n-\u2002Column 1 \u2013 Item No.\n\n-\u2002Column 2 \u2013 Item type (Contractor\u2019s Documents, samples)\n\nChlorine Dosing Room, etc.)\n\n-\u2002Column 4 \u2013 Submission for: approval or consent\n\n-\u2002Column 5 \u2013 Submission format (electronic and/or hard copies)\n\n-\u2002Column 6 \u2013 Number of submissions originals and copies\n\n-\u2002Column 5 \u2013 Review period in days, by the Employer\u2019s Representative (default position is 21 days under GCC Subclause 5.2)\n\nThis section shall also indicate any design review by, and then consent and/or approval process from local authorities as might be \nimposed by the applicable Laws and regulations.

Public health authorities are also frequently involved in the assessment of the water \nquality produced by a Water Treatment Plant before it is put in operation and water is distributed to the local population.\n\nAny of these requirements, as imposed in the Country where the project is carried out, shall be reflected in this section of the \nEmployer\u2019s Requirements.\n\n5.11\u2002Quality

These are \nmaterials which are inputs to be used by the Contractor when delivering the Operation Service.\n\nThe Employer should detail here the quality, purpose, and function of these materials as these are items on which the Contractor \nhas no control, but which can be critical for the Contractor to achieve the Operation Service in accordance with the Contract, and \nin particular to achieve his/her performance guarantees.\n\nTypically, raw water coming from a water source (river, dam, underground water) would qualify as raw material for a Water \nTreatment Plant, and wastewater coming from a municipal sewerage network would qualify as raw material for a Wastewater \nTreatment Plant.\n\nTheir quality and availability should be detailed by the Employer as they will form the basis on which the Contractor will build up \nhis/her design to ensure that the delivered facility will be fit for the purposes intended under the Contract.\n\n\f202\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n8.\u2002Contractor\u2019s Personnel requirements\n\nUsing Form PER-1 and PER-2 in Section 4 (Bidding Forms), the Bidder must demonstrate that it has personnel \nwho meet the following requirements:\n\nCriteria/requirements for Contractor\u2019s key personnel shall be detailed here, such as for the Contractor\u2019s Representative under \nGCC Subclause 4.3, or the Contractor\u2019s designers under GCC Subclause 5.1.\n\nno.\n\nPosition\n\ntotal Work \nexperience [years]\n\nexperience In similar \nWork [years]\n\nnOte\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nnOtes\n\nThe managerial and technical competence of a Contractor is largely related to key personnel on site. The extent to which the \nBidder should demonstrate having staff with extensive experience should be limited to those requiring critical operational or \ntechnical skills. The Contractor\u2019s Personnel requirements should therefore refer to a limited number of such key personnel, such as, \nfor instance and without necessarily be limited to:\n\n\u2022\u2002The\tContractor\u2019s\tRepresentative\tas\tper\tGCC\tSubclause\t4.3.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tThose\tsuperintendents\tworking\tunder\tthe\tContractor\u2019s\tRepresentative\tmanagement\tand\twho\twill\tbe\tresponsible\tfor\t\n\nmajor components of the Works (e.g., the Commissioning Manager supervising the Tests on Completion sequence\u2014pre-\ncommissioning, commissioning, and trial run of the Works under GCC Subclause 11.1, the Supervisor of welding works, etc. as \nrequired for each particular project). \n\n\u2022\u2002Those\tfulfilling\tkey\thorizontal\tactivities:\n\no\u2002a\tQuality\tAssurance/Quality\tControl\tManager,\t\n\no\u2002 a Compliance Manager or HSES (Health, Safety, Environment, and Social Manager) Manager, who would ensure \n\nContractor\u2019s compliance with the HSES requirements under the Contract, and in particular the ADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) requirements as laid down under GCC Subclause 4.26 and the Employer\u2019s Requirements,\n\no\u2002Etc.\n\n\u2022\u2002Etc.\n\nRequirements should specify:\n\n(a)\u2002the minimum number of years of experience in a similar position; and\n\n(b)\u2002 the minimum number of years of experience and/or number of comparable projects carried out in a specified number of \n\npreceding years.\n\nThe requirement of education and academic qualification is normally unnecessary for such positions, as contractors often employ \ncompetent staff who have learned their profession \u201con the job\u201d rather than through academic training. It is appropriate to specify \nthat certain positions are filled by individuals who have held posts of comparable authority for, say, 3 years with the Bidder, so \nthat key staff in executive site positions have sufficient knowledge of the Bidder\u2019s management, policy, procedures, and practices \nto act with confidence and authority within that framework.\n\n\fEMPLOYER\u2019S REQUIREMENTS\n\n203\n\n9.\u2002Contractor\u2019s Equipment requirements\n\nUsing Form EQU in Section 4 (Bidding Forms), the Bidder must demonstrate that it has the key equipment listed \nbelow:\n\nno.\n\nequipment type and Characteristics\n\nMinimum number required\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nnOtes\n\nThe Employer should only specify bulky or specialized items that are critical for the type of project to be implemented, and which \nmay be difficult for the Contractor to obtain quickly. \n\nExamples may include items such as heavy lift cranes and piling barges.\n\nHolding and maintaining construction equipment represents a high capital cost overhead to a Contractor. Consequently, not all \ncompetent potential Bidders will keep and maintain such high-value items that are in suitable condition for major contracts. This \nis particularly so with management contractors, who undertake construction projects mainly by subcontracting. \n\nIn most cases, Bidders can readily purchase, lease, or hire equipment.\n\nThe availability of such Subcontractors and of the specified equipment should be subject to verification prior to Contract award.\n\n\f204\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n10.\u2002 appendix 1: auditing Body  \n\nterms of reference\n\nnOte\n\nThe Terms of Reference set out below reflect the main services expected from the Auditing Body.

Detailed terms of \nthe Financing Agreement in between the Employer and financiers such as the ADB should not be disclosed here to the Contractor, \nbut the structure of the financing can be developed (percentage of ADB funds, percentage of national funds, etc.). The objective \nof this Appendix is to represent to the Contractor that there is sound and reliable financing secured for the implementation of the \nContract.\n\n\f208\n\nsection 7: general Conditions  \nof Contract\n\nThe Conditions of Contract comprise two parts, this Section 7\u2014General Conditions of Contract (GCC) and the \nfollowing Section 8\u2014Particular Conditions of Contract (PCC).\n\nThe General Conditions shall be the Conditions of Contract for Design, Build, and Operate Projects, also known as \n\u201cthe Gold Book\u201d, 2008 edition, prepared by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseil (FIDIC). They are \nnot reproduced here, and Bidders who do not have a set of the Gold Book can purchase it at the FIDIC Bookshop: \nwww.fidic.org.\n\nThe  standard  text  of  the  General  Conditions  chosen  shall  remain  intact  as  it  is  under  the  copyright  of  FIDIC. \nAny amendments and additions sought to the GCC should be introduced in Section 8 (Particular Conditions of \nContract), Part A (Contract Data) and Part B (Special Provisions). Clause numbers in the PCC correspond to those \nin the GCC. \n\nAs per GCC Subclause 1.5 (Priority of Documents), the PCC takes precedence over the GCC. Accordingly, owing \nto the potentially severe legal consequences of improper changes brought to the Conditions of Contract by means \nof the PCC, they shall be drafted by those familiar with the project and its requirements, and they shall be legally \nreviewed by qualified lawyers experienced and familiar with the FIDIC forms of Contract, as well as with the law \ngoverning the Contract.\n\nPart A (Contract Data) of the PCC includes data to complement the GCC in a manner similar to the way in which \nthe Bid Data Sheet (BDS) complements the Instructions to Bidders (ITB).\n\nPart B (Specific Provisions) is to be used to introduce country or project-specific provisions, if so required. \n\n\fsection 8: Particular Conditions  \nof Contract\n\n209\n\nThe conditions

precedence  over \nthe equivalent provisions found under the same Subclause number(s) in the General Conditions, and the \nprovisions of the Particular Conditions Part A \u2013 Contract Data take

There is a similar provision for the start of the Operation Service, in relation \nwith the insurances to be taken by the Contractor during that Period. This is a safe provision for the Employer, in particular \nwith due regard to the possible personal injury, physical damage, or economic loss which the Contractor\u2019s activities may \ncause to the Employer and/or third parties.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tAdapt\tthe\tPerformance\tSecurity\trequirements\tunder\tSubclause\t4.2\tto\ta\tmore\tlimited\tperiod\tthan\tunder\tthe\tGold\tBook,\twhere\t\n\nthe latter foresees that it is to remain valid over the Contract life. International practices cast a doubt as to whether such \nlong-term financial security (running possibly over decades) requirement is achievable and recommendable in practice, since \noperation services contract are generally not subject to this, and such requirement would bring long-term financial constraints \nto the Contractor which would inevitably be reflected into the Contract Price, hence to the expense of the Employer. The \nPerformance Security duration has then been made to last until the end of the Retention Period, which is one year after the \ndate stated in the Commissioning Certificate (which goes for the acceptance of the Design\u2013Build of the Works as per Subclause \n11.7). This was made under the rationale that:\n\n\f216\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\no\u2002\tThere\tis\ta\tMaintenance\tRetention\tof\t5%\twhich\tis\tconstituted\tout\tof\tthe\tvalue\tof\teach\tinterim\tpayment\tto\tthe\tContractor\tover\t\n\nthe Operation Service Period, as per Subclause 14.19\n\no\u2002 The first half of the Retention Money, which is progressively built up over the Design\u2013Build Period under the Contract, is now \n(through PCC) released at the end of the Retention Period (1 year after the date stated in the Commissioning Certificate), \nand the second part is released at the end of the Operation Service Period, while initially under the GCC the Retention Money \nwas fully released at the end of the Retention Period.

Such use of the DAB is found to be a sound value for money measure for the Parties hence for the project. While \ndelivering dispute prevention duties, Subclause 20.5 makes it clear that the DAB shall not meet any of the Parties alone (\u201cin \ncaucus\u201d), but always meet the Parties jointly. This is to avoid any potential subsequent challenge to a DAB decision for breach \nof natural justice (where it can be argued that private discussions with a Party, without the other Party being present and being \ngiven an opportunity to comment/object, could convey material impressions to the DAB which subsequently influence any \ndecision it issues), as has been experienced in some jurisdictions.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tGive\tto\tthe\tParties\tthe\tpossibility\tto\trefer\tany\tDispute\tto\tthe\tDAB\tunder\tSubclause\t20.6,\tas\totherwise\tthe\tGold\tBook\timposes\t\nthat such referral is only made upon a dissatisfaction expressed on a claim for time and/or money under Subclause 20.1 or \n20.2. Indeed, there are certain matters of potential Dispute between the Parties where it is found beneficial to leave an option \nfor early Dispute referral to the DAB (issue of a Commissioning Certificate under Clause 11, an Employer\u2019s Representative\u2019s \ninstruction to remove personnel under Subclause 6.9, a payment certification under Subclause 14.7, etc.), without entering \ninto the time and costs of a formal claim process under either Subclause 20.1 and Subclause 20.2. Subclause 20.6 now allows \nfor such early referrals, as provided under the FIDIC 1999 Suite of Contracts and in the FIDIC MDB 2010 Harmonized Edition \nused in the ADB SBD for Works. \n\n\u2022\u2002\tThe\tDAB\tunder\tthe\tOperation\tService\tPeriod\tis\tmade\tto\tbe\ton\tad\thoc\tbasis\tunder\tSubclause\t20.10,\ti.e.,\tmobilized\tonly\tif\tand\t\nwhen a dispute arises between the Parties.

Failure by the Contractor to give such early warning would then make the Contractor subject to the risk and cost of \nproceeding with the instruction. Such amendments are often made to construction contracts, especially when the Employer\u2019s \nRepresentative is an independent entity from the Employer.

Fund.\n\nA comparison shall then be made, for each asset under the Asset Replacement Schedule, in between:\n\n\u2022\t the actual asset replacement cost (hereinafter referred to as \u201cACT\u201d) incurred by the Employer over the \n\nOperation Service Period, and \n\n\u2022\t the expected asset replacement cost (hereinafter referred to as \u201cEXP\u201d) the Employer was meant to incur \n\nover the Operation Service Period, based on the Asset Replacement Schedule.\n\nACT shall be calculated as follows:\n\nACT = \n\nOSP x (ARVactual + ARVfuture)\n (OSP + RLactual)\n\nWhere:\n\nOSP is the Operation Service Period duration in years.\n\nRLactual is the actual Residual Life expectancy of the asset considered, as agreed or determined by the Em-\nployer\u2019s

value the Employer would have paid to the Contractor, had the Contract not reached com-\npletion, for the next replacement of the asset considered once the Residual Life has expired, based on the \nreplacement value set in the Asset Replacement Schedule.\n\nEXP shall be calculated as follows:\n\nWhere:\n\nEXP = OSP x (ARVactual + ARVfuture)\n\n (OSP + RLEXP)\n\nRLEXP is the Residual Life

lower than what the Employer expected when entering into the Contract.\n\nIn the former case, the Contractor is liable to pay higher assets depreciation to the Employer.\n\nIn the latter case, the Parties will share the gain stemming from this lower depreciation of assets.\n\nAs an example, assume a 12-year Operation Service Period with only 2 assets (A1 and A2) in the Asset Replacement

12\nARVactual = 200 (100 paid twice)\nARVfuture = 100\nRLactual = 1\n\nThis gives ACT= 12 x (200 + 100) / (12 + 1) = 276.92\n\n\f244\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS

RLARS)\n\nWhere:\nRLARS=3. \n\nIndeed, if Asset A1 had been replaced every 5 years as per the Asset Replacement Schedule, the next asset replacement would have \noccurred at the end of year 15, i.e., 3 years after the Contract completion.\n\nThis gives EXP = 12 x (200 + 100) / (12 + 3) = 240\n\nHad the Contractor complied with its warranties under the

a total, paid 200 to the Contractor for asset replacement, for then a total cost of 240 over the 12-year Operation Service \nPeriod. Indeed, beyond the 200 paid to the Contractor, the Employer should set aside a provision of 20 (100/5) per year for \nasset depreciation, after the last replacement was made, to be able to financially face the next replacement beyond the Contract \nPeriod.\n\nHowever, since the asset had in effect to be replaced earlier than expected under the Operation Service Period, the residual life \nof the asset, at Contract completion, is less than it should have been had the Contractor complied with its warranties under the \nContract. Accordingly, the actual replacement cost to the Employer increases, and reaches the value of 276,92 over the Operation \nService Period. \n\nThere is then 276.92 \u2013 240 = 36.92 of economic loss suffered by the Employer, which is flowing from the Contractor\u2019s breach of \nwarranties given under the Contract and for which the Contractor is then liable toward the Employer.\n\nTurning to Asset A2, let\u2019s now calculate ACT,\n\nWhere:\nOSP = 12\nARVactual = 0 (nothing was paid to the Contractor)\nARVfuture = 400\nRLactual = 3\n\nThis gives ACT = 12 x 400 / (12 + 3) = 320\n\nLet\u2019s now calculate EXP for Asset A2, where RLARS=8. \n\nIndeed, if Asset A2 had been replaced after 10 years as per the Asset Replacement Schedule, the next asset replacement would \nhave occurred at the end of year 20, i.e., 8 years after the Contract completion.\n\nThis gives EXP = 12 x (400+400) / (12 + 8) = 480\n\nThe Contractor did better than what he/she warrantied, resulting in the actual replacement costs being lower than what was \nanticipated had the Contractor strictly complied with his/her warranty. \n\nThere is then 480 \u2013 320 = 160 of economic gain for the Employer. \n\nAs a summary:\n\n\u2022\u2002ACTglobal = ACT Asset A1 + ACT Asset A2 =276.92 + 320 = 596.92\n\u2022\u2002EXPglobal = EXP Asset A1 + EXP Asset A2 = 240 + 480 = 720\n\u2022\u2002\tEXPglobal is higher than the ACTglobal, which means that overall the Contractor did better than committed under the Contract, \nand succeeded in optimizing the operation of the assets, increasing their life span and decreasing their expected depreciation \nagainst what was expected when the Contract was formed. The gain so generated for the benefit of the Employer amounts to \nEXPglobal - ACTglobal = 720 \u2013 596.92

Performance Damages\n\n1.\u2003Introduction and scope of Application of Performance Damages\n\nThis  Appendix  defines  the  performance  damages  which  are  to  be  paid  by  the  Contractor  in  case  the \nContractor does not comply, during the Operation Service Period, with the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) \nvalues defined under the Schedule of Performance Guarantees. \n\nSuch performance damages apply in furtherance to the provisions contained in:\n\na)  GCC Subclause 10.7 [Failure to Reach Production Outputs], and\n\nb) GCC Subclause 11.11 [Failure to Pass Tests Prior to Contract Completion].\n\nThese performance damages shall be the only damages due from the Contractor for such default, other than \nin the event of termination under Clause 15 [Termination by Employer]. \n\nThe  payment  of  such  performance  damages  shall  not  relieve  the  Contractor  of  any  duties,  obligations,  or \nresponsibilities he/she has under the Contract, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to ensure \nthat the Works remain in accordance with the Contract during the Operation Service Period. \n\nnOtes\n\nAs a general comment, it should be noted that the interest, contract administration wise, of defining performance damages \nis that these are damages pre-set in Contract which do not require the Employer to prove its actual loss when applying those. \nThis does greatly simplify contract administration processes.\n\nHowever, care should be given by the Employer to define performance damages which, as much as practicable, are genuine \npre-estimates of losses likely to be incurred by the Employer because of a Contractor\u2019s breach of a KPI value. \n\nOtherwise, by defining damages in an arbitrary manner without any attempt to relate those to actual Employer\u2019s loss, the \nEmployer runs the risk that such damages will be re-characterized as strict penalties rather than as a compensation for losses. \n\nShould this occur, performance damages could then be challenged at law in some jurisdictions (in particular common law \njurisdictions) which do not authorize the application of penal remedies for civil liability matters.\n\nIt should be noted that, while civil law jurisdictions recognize the possibility to apply penalties in commercial contracts, such \njurisdictions nevertheless also sometimes empower the judiciary to adjust penalties, in case those are found unreasonably high \nor low versus the actual loss suffered by the Employer. \n\nAs a corollary of the above, the more performance damages are connected to the foreseeable loss of the Employer in case of a \nContractor\u2019s breach of KPI values, the better.\n\n\f248\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER

CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT\n\n249\n\nnOtes\n\nThe above are only examples given for guidance purposes, and it is for the Employer to select performance damages which are \nsuitable for each project.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction above, the Employer shall define performance damages which represent a genuine pre-\nestimate of the Employer\u2019s foreseeable losses in case the Contractor breaches a KPI value, so that the performance damages set \nherein are meant to cover such loss.\n\nLoss for the Employer can be of different kinds, with non-exhaustive examples being given as follows:\n\n-\u2002Fines for breach of statutory duties,\n\n-\u2002Loss of revenue,\n\n-\u2002Loss of reputation,\n\n-\u2002Etc.\n\nThere is no need to define here performance damages for input-based KPIs, such as energy or chemicals consumption, since \nthe breach of such kind of KPIs is directly covered by payment deductions during the Operation Service Period \u2013 see Appendix \n1 to these PCC Part B.\n\nFor example, for energy consumption, any consumption in excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption during \nthe Operation Service Period is already at the sole cost of the Contractor as defined in the Schedule of Payments for Price \nSchedule 5. Similarly, any excess of the guaranteed consumption in the consumption of chemicals is a risk of the Contractor \nsince this does not generate additional payment under Price Schedule 5. Those input-related KPIs are consequently not \nreflected in this table above, but instead are covered in the one below: when the Contract is coming to an end.\n\n3.\u2003failure to Pass tests Prior to Contract Completion\n\nThe  performance  damages  below  correspond  to  the  amount  to  be  paid  by  the  Contractor  to  the  Employer  for \nfailure to pass the Tests Prior to Contract Completion, as laid down under subparagraph (c) of GCC Subclause \n11.11.\n\nNo\n\nKPI description\n\nKPI Breach\n\nPerformance damages\n\nGuaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption \nRate\n\nFailure to meet the rate by \nless than 5%\n\nNo damages apply\n\nFailure to meet the rate by \nmore than 5%\n\nCalculated as per formula below\n\nGuaranteed Minimum Sludge Dry Solids \nContents\n\nFailure to meet the rate by \nless than 5%\n\nNo damages apply\n\nGuaranteed Maximum Chemicals \nConsumption Rate\n\nNonrevenue Water below YY%\n\nNo damages apply\n\nFailure to meet the rate by \nmore than 5%\n\nFailure to meet the rate by \nless than 5%\n\nFailure to meet the rate by \nmore than 5%\n\nFailure to meet the rate by \nless than 5%\n\nFailure to meet the rate by \nmore than 5%\n\nCalculated as per formula below\n\nNo damages apply\n\nCalculated as per formula below\n\nCalculated as per formula below\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\f250\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n9\n\nCompliance with the drinking water \nquality standards defined in the Employer\u2019s \nRequirements\n\nNoncompliance\n\n10\n\nProduction of a minimum of XX m3/day at \nthe outlet of the Water Treatment Plant at \nany time of the year\n\nLower production than the \nminimum set\n\nCalculated as being the cost for \nthe Employer to remedy this failure \nor any other method deemed \nrelevant and reasonable to assess \nthe Employer\u2019s foreseeable losses \nflowing from that breach of \nContract\n\nCalculated as being the cost for the \nEmployer to remedy this failure, \nor its loss of revenue, or any other \nmethod deemed relevant and \nreasonable to assess the Employer\u2019s \nforeseeable losses flowing from that \nbreach of Contract\n\nEtc.\n\nWhere:\n\nFormula for performance damages under item 2:\n\nPD =  (AECR \u2013 (GMECRx1,05)) x V x RLE x CE x I\n\n-  PD = Performance Damages in currency\n-  AECR = Actual Energy Consumption Rate (in kWh per m3 of water production)\n-  GMECR = Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate (in kWh per m3 of water production) \n\nas defined in the Schedule of Performance Guarantees\n\n-  V = Production Volume (in m3/year)\n-  RLE = Residual Life Expectancy of the facility, being the difference in between the life span expec-\ntancy of the facility, as defined in the Schedule of Performance Guarantees, and the Operation \nService Period\n\n-  CE = Cost of Electricity, in currency per kWh\nI = Inflation rate over the RLE, in percentage\n- \n\nFormula for performance damages under item 4:\n\nWhere:\n\nPD = [((GMDSCx0,95) -

For example, certain jurisdictions impose insurances \n\nto be taken for the so-called decennial liability, being the liability of the Contractor, within 10 years from substantial \ncompletion of the Works, for any defect which may affect the stability of the Works and/or their fitness for purpose, and/or\n\n-\u2002 Any insurance locally available at commercially reasonable rates in relation with the facility to be designed, built and \n\noperated under the Contract. For example, Business Interruption insurances may be available and cover losses in case the \nfacility is to be shut down for a certain period.\n\nInsurance due diligence should be carried out by the Employer at project preparation stage, in consultation with insurance \nspecialists (lawyers, brokers, and/or consultants) familiar with the insurance practices in the Country, to determine what \ninsurances can/must be maintained under the Contract, and on what terms. The insurance due diligence should also \nhighlight whether, owing to the project features, it might be in the better interest of the Employer to directly take some of the \ninsurances which are to be provided by the Contractor under Subclauses 19.2 and 19.3. If this is the case, Clause 19 should be \namended accordingly by the Employer under the Particular Conditions Part B.\n\nNote that the FIDIC Gold Book has accordingly provided for a split in between the DBO contract risks as follows, i.e., in \nessence a split between generally insurable and generally non-insurable risks:\n\n-\u2002 Under GCC Subclause 1.1.7: \u201cCommercial Risk\u201d means a risk which results in financial loss and/or time loss for either of \n\nthe Parties, where insurance is not generally or commercially available.\n\n-\u2002 Under GCC Subclause 1.1.67: \u201cRisk of Damage\u201d means a risk which results in physical loss or damage to the Works or other \n\nproperty belonging to either Party, other than a Commercial Risk.\n\nThe elements below reflect the data which are referred to under Clause 19, and to be completed by the Employer prior to \nfinalizing the Bidding Document.\n\n1.\u2002Insurances to be taken Out by the Contractor During the Design\u2013Build Period\n\nThe data referred to under GCC Subclause 19.2 [Insurances to be provided by the Contractor during the Design\u2013\nBuild Period], are as follows.\n\nInsurance for the Works\n\nPermitted deductible limit as per GCC \nSubclause 19.2(a)(i)\n\nAdditional sum to replacement value \nas per GCC Subclause 19.2(a)(ii)\n\n[State percentage] of full replacement \nvalue\n\n[State percentage] of full replacement \nvalue\n\n\fPARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT\n\n253\n\nEmployer\u2019s Risks under GCC Subclause 17.1(b)(iii) to form part of the insurance cover:\n\n[List those operation of the forces of nature which are to be covered by the Contractor\u2019s insurance for the Works; \notherwise state \u201cNone\u201d]\n\nExceptional Event under GCC Subclause 18.1(f) to form part of the insurance cover:\n\n[List those natural catastrophes which are to be covered by the Contractor\u2019s insurance for the Works; otherwise \nstate \u201cNone\u201d]\n\nThe FIDIC Gold Book generally contemplates that non-insurable risks are borne by the Employer, except for all Contractor\u2019s \ndesign, materials, and workmanship, and those risks also directly attributable to acts or omissions of the Contractor or of the \nContractor\u2019s Personnel.\n\nThe FIDIC Gold Book has accordingly defined that the Risk of Damage caused by:\n\n\u2022\u2002\toperation\tof\tthe\tforces\tof\tnature,\tagainst\twhich\tan\texperienced\tcontractor\tcould\tnot\thave\treasonably\tbeen\texpected\tto\thave\t\n\ntaken adequate preventative precautions; or\n\n\u2022\u2002\tExceptional\tRisks,\tas\tdefined\tunder\tGCC\tClause\t18\t(which\tare\trisks\tcaused\tby\tExceptional\tEvents,\tthose\tcorresponding\tto\t\n\nthe Force Majeure events as referred to in the FIDIC 1999 Suite of Contracts);\n\nis borne by the Employer, under the assumption that such risk events would generally not be insurable at reasonable \ncommercial terms.\n\nHowever, the FIDIC Gold Book recognizes that such risk events might actually be insurable at reasonable commercial terms, \ndepending on the project nature and location, which explains why the Contract leaves the opportunity to the Employer to \ndefine which, if any, of those risk events are to be insured by the Contractor. The insurance due diligence carried out at project \npreparation stage would assist the Employer in deciding which option to choose under this Subclause.\n\nInsurance for the Contractor\u2019s equipment\n\nAmount of insurance cover required under \nGCC Subclause 19.2(b)\n\n[State amount]\n\n- \n\n- \n\nnOtes\n\nnOte\n\nSome items within the definition of Contractor\u2019s Equipment, such as vehicles, may in any event be required to be insured by \nlaw, and it is the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to see that such items are properly insured before being used.\n\nIt might consequently well be that, based on the insurance due diligence aforementioned, two distinct insurances would \nbe required from the Contractor\u2014one covering motor vehicles, on one hand, and one covering the rest of the Contractor\u2019s \nEquipment, on the other hand.\n\n\f254\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nProfessional liability Insurance\n\nMinimum amount of insurance cover \nrequired under GCC Subclause 19.2(c)\n\nPeriod for which professional liability \ninsurance is required\n\n[State amount]\n\n[State period]\n\nnOtes\n\nIt should be noted that this subparagraph (c) under GCC Subclause 19.2 requires the Contractor to take out professional \nliability insurance which provides for cover in case an act or omission of the Contractor results in the Works not being fit for \npurpose as specified in the Contract.\n\nHowever, these insurances generally only cover professionals for their negligence, i.e., for their failure to act with reasonable \nskill and care, but not necessarily for their failure to reach set results, such as when they warrant that the facility will be fit-for-\npurpose as specified in the Contract.\n\nThe Contractor\u2019s obligations under Subclause 4.1 make him/her strictly liable if, at any time after the completion of the \nDesign\u2013Build Period, the facility is no longer fit-for-purpose.

Thereafter,  the  DAB  shall  make  and  give  its  decision  in  accordance  with  Subclause  20.6 \n[Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board\u2019s Decision] of the General Conditions of Contract, or as otherwise \nagreed by the Employer and the Contractor in writing.\n\n12. \n\nIf the DAB comprises three persons:\n\n(a)\u2002it shall convene in private after a hearing, in order to have discussions and prepare its decision;\n\n(b)\u2002 it shall endeavor to reach a unanimous decision: if this proves impossible the applicable decision shall be \nmade by a majority of the Members, who may require the minority Member to prepare a written report \nfor submission to the Employer and the Contractor; and\n\n(c)\u2002 if a Member fails to attend a meeting or hearing, or to fulfill any required function, the other two Members \n\nmay nevertheless proceed to make a decision, unless:\n\n(i)\u2002either the Employer or the Contractor does not agree that they do so; or\n\n(ii)\u2002 the absent Member is the chairman and he/she instructs the other Members not to make a decision.\n\n\fSTANDARD BIDDING DOCUMENT \nFOR DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE \nCONTRACTS FOR WATER AND \nWASTEWATER GREENFIELD \nINFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nTwo-Stage Bidding Procedure\n\n\f276\n\ntwo-stage Bidding Procedure\n\nIn  the  two-stage  bidding  procedure,  Bidders  first  submit  their  technical  proposals,  in  accordance  with  the \nEmployer\u2019s Requirements, but without prices. The technical proposals are opened at the date and time advised in \nthe Bidding Document. The technical proposals are evaluated and may be discussed with the Bidders. Deficiencies, \nextraneous provisions, and unsatisfactory technical features are pointed out to the Bidders whose comments are \ncarefully evaluated. The Bidders are allowed to revise or adjust their technical proposals to meet the requirements \nof the Employer. \n\nThe objective of this process is to ensure that\n\n\u2022\t Uncertainties and misunderstandings as to the Employer\u2019s Requirements are addressed and remedied. This is \nparticularly the case for large process plants, where such issues could occur and where a Single-Stage Bidding \nProcedure may run the risk of seeing an excessive number of Bidders being disqualified for having failed to fully \ncapture complex Employer\u2019s Requirements into their respective Bid.\n\n\u2022\t All technical proposals are to conform to the same acceptable standards and meet the Employer\u2019s Requirements, \nas possibly amended in between Stage 1 and Stage 2. Bidders who are unable or unwilling to bring their Bids to \nthe acceptable technical standard may be rejected as deficient Bids.\n\n\u2022\t A competitive and constructive dialogue is initiated with the Bidders, in order for the Employer to benefit from \ntheir experience and skills, which may in some instances generate ideas and views that the Employer and its \nconsultants did not consider when preparing the Bidding Documents, but which are considered positive for \nthe project and the communities it served.\n\nAfter the evaluation of technical proposals has been approved by ADB, the second stage is to invite Bidders to \nsubmit  price  proposals  and  revised  technical  proposals  in  compliance  with  the  Employer\u2019s  Requirements.  The \nrevised technical proposals and price proposals are opened in public at a date and time advised by the Employer. \nIn  setting  the  date,  the  Employer  should  allow  sufficient  time  for  Bidders  to  incorporate  the  changes  involved \nin the technical proposals and prepare price proposals. The price proposals and revised technical proposals are \nevaluated, and following ADB\u2019s approval, the contract is awarded to the Bidder whose Bid has been determined to \nbe the lowest evaluated substantially responsive Bid.\n\nThe following documents structure flowchart shows how the Bidding Document is intended to be used both during \nthe bidding process and during the formulation of the eventual contract documents.\n\n\fTWO-STAGE BIDDING PROCEDURE\n\n277\n\ntwo-Stage Bidding Procedure Documents \nStructure Flowchart\n\nthe Bidding Document\n\nIssued by employer\n\nSection 1 \u2013 Instructions to Bidders (ITB)\n\nSection 2 \u2013 Bid Data Sheet (BDS)\n\nSection 3 \u2013 Evaluation and Qualification Criteria (EQC)\n\n1\n\nSection 4 \u2013 Bidding Forms (BDF)\n\nSection 5 \u2013 Eligible Countries (ELC)\n\nSection 6 \u2013 Employer\u2019s Requirements (ERQ)\n\nSection 7 \u2013 General Conditions of Contract (GCC)\n\nSection 8 \u2013 Particular Conditions of Contract (PCC)\n\nSection 9 \u2013 Contract Forms (COF)\n\nthe first-stage Bid\n\nsubmitted by Bidder\n\n(i)  The Letter of First-Stage Bid;\n(ii)  Written confirmation authorizing the signatory of the Bid to commit the Bidder, in \n\naccordance with ITB 18.2;\n\n(iii)  Documentary  evidence  in  accordance  with  ITB  14,  the  Bidder\u2019s  eligibility  and \n\nqualifications to perform the contract if its Bid is accepted;\n\n(iv)  Documentary  evidence  establishing  in  accordance  with  ITB  15  that  the  Plant, \n\nMaterials, and Services offered by the Bidder in its Bid are eligible;\n\n(v)  Documentary  evidence  in  accordance  with  ITB  16,  that  the  Plant,  Materials,  and \nServices offered by the Bidder conform to the Bidding Document and/or details of \ndeviations in accordance with ITB 16.2;

QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\n321\n\nnOtes\n\nThis section contains the criteria that the Employer shall use to evaluate Bids and qualify Bidders if the bidding was \nnot preceded by a prequalification exercise and post qualification is applied. If prequalification is undertaken by the \nEmployer, the qualification criteria set out under that Section should be used.\n\nADB requires Bidders to be qualified by meeting predefined, precise minimum requirements. The method entails \nsetting pass\u2013fail criteria, which, if not met by the Bidder, results in disqualification.\n\nIt will therefore be necessary to ensure that a Bidder\u2019s risk of having its bid rejected on grounds of qualification is \nremote if due diligence is exercised by the Bidder during bid preparation. For that purpose, clear-cut, pass\u2013fail \nqualification criteria need to be defined and indicated in the Invitation for Bids and the Bidding Document to enable \nBidders to make an informed decision whether to pursue a specific Contract and, if so, whether to pursue it as a single \nentity or in Joint Venture. The criteria adopted must relate to characteristics that are essential to ensure satisfactory \nexecution of the Contract, and must be stated in clear terms. In accordance with ITB 25, ITB 27, ITB 44, ITB 48, and \nITB 49, no other methods, criteria, and factors shall be used. \n\nThe Bidder shall provide all the information requested in the forms included in Section 4 (Bidding Forms). In case \nthe bidding was preceded by a prequalification process, updating of information pertaining to a Bidder\u2019s eligibility, \nhistorical contract nonperformance, and financial situation will be necessary during bidding.\n\n\f322\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\na.\u2002First-Stage Evaluation\n\n1.\u2003Qualification\n\n1.1\u2003eligibility\n\nCriteria\n\nCompliance requirements\n\nDocuments\n\njoint Venture\n\nrequirement\n\nsingle entity\n\nAll Partners \nCombined\n\nEach \nPartner\n\nOne \nPartner\n\nsubmission \nrequirements\n\nNationality in accordance \nwith ITB\u00a0 4.2.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nForms ELI \u2013 1; \nELI \u2013 2 with \nattachments\n\nNo conflicts of interest in \naccordance with ITB 4.3.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nLetter of First-\nStage Bid\n\n1.1.1\u2003nationality\n\n1.1.2\u2003Conflict of Interest\n\n1.1.3\u2003ADB eligibility\n\nNot having been declared \nineligible by ADB, as \ndescribed in ITB 4.4.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nLetter of First-\nStage Bid\n\n1.1.4\u2003 government-Owned enterprise \n\nBidder required to meet \nconditions of ITB 4.5.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nForms                  \n\nELI - 1; ELI - 2\nwith attachments\n\n1.1.5\u2003united nations eligibility\n\nNot having been excluded \nby an act of compliance with \na United Nations Security \nCouncil resolution in \naccordance with ITB 4.8.\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nNot  \napplicable\n\nLetter of First-\nStage Bid\n\n\fEVALUATION AND QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\n323\n\n1.2\u2003Historical Contract nonperformance\n\n1.2.1\u2003History of nonperforming Contracts\n\nCriteria\n\nCompliance requirements\n\nDocuments\n\njoint Venture\n\nrequirement\n\nsingle  \nentity\n\nAll Partners \nCombined\n\nEach \nPartner\n\nOne \nPartner\n\nsubmission \nrequirements\n\nNonperformance of a contracta did \nnot occur as a result of contractor \ndefault since 1 January [insert year].\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirement\n\nMust meet \nrequirementb\n\nNot \napplicable\n\nForm CON-1\n\na  Nonperformance, as decided by the Employer, shall include all contracts where (a) nonperformance was not challenged \nby the contractor, including through referral to the dispute resolution mechanism under the respective contract, and (b) \ncontracts that were so challenged but fully settled against the contractor.

Obviously, if the Contract Period equates such expected life span, there shall be no adjustment under \nthis part since the Contractor will bear the operation and maintenance cost risk of the facility over its entire expected life span, \nand the Bid price shall then be considered as a fair reflection of the Employer\u2019s whole life cycle cost for the said facility.\n\nIf the period for Operation Service is less than 5 years, then:\n\n\u2022\u2002\tEither\tthe\tEmployer\tmay\twish\tto\tmaintain\tthe\tAsset\tReplacement\tFund\tand\tSchedule\tmechanism\tforeseen\tunder\tthe\t\n\nContract, in which case he/she shall:\n\no\u2002 Amend the terms of GCC Subclause 14.18, by means of the PCC, to lower the 5-year threshold to the targeted threshold; \n\nand\n\no\u2002 Amend Price Schedule 7 under Section 4 of this Bidding Document to make the Schedule applicable as of 1 year after the \n\nthreshold, instead of Year 6 which is the default position under the Contract;\n\n\u2022\u2002\tOr\tthe\tEmployer\tmay\tprefer\tto\tremove\tall\treferences\tto\tthe\tAsset\tReplacement\tFund\tand\tSchedule\tmechanism.\tIn\twhich\tcase,\t\n\nthe Employer shall remove any reference in this respect in the Bidding Document such as under:\n\no\u2002 Section 3 \u2013 item 5 above;\n\no\u2002 Section 8\n\no\u2002 Section 4 \u2013 Letter of Bid, Preamble to the Price Schedules, Price Schedule 7, and Price Schedule 8;\n\no\u2002 Section 6 \u2013 Appendix 1 \u2013 ToR Auditing Body, ad hoc duties item b);\n\n-\u2002 The provisions related to the Asset Replacement Fund and Schedule which are currently found in the PCC shall be \n\nremoved.

Indeed, a Bidder could be tempted to artificially come up with a low Operation Service price in his/her bid, \nwhich would make that, when this low Operation Service is extrapolated over the life span of the facility (for the sake of bid \nevaluation only), it would give him/her an undue competitive advantage. \n\nAs an example, assume that:\n\n-\u2002the DB component of the facility is meant to be worth 50; and \n\n-\u2002the O component is meant to be worth 50 over 25 years, hence 2 per year;\n\nthen a prudent Bidder for a 5-year operation DBO Contract would bid for 50 (DB) + 2 x 5 (2 of Operation Service per year \nmultiplied by 5 years) = 60.\n\nA Bidder trying to take advantage of the whole life cycle cost formula for bid evaluation could come up with an O&M price of say \n0.5 instead of 2.\n\nThis would make that:\n\n-\u2002his/her Contract Price is 50 (DB) + 0.5 x5 (O&M) = 52.5; and\n\n-\u2002 the whole life cycle cost evaluation of his/her bid, over 25 years (life span of the facility) is 50 (DB) + 0.5x25 (O&M) = 62.5 \n\nwhere a prudent Bidder would come up with 100\n\nOne may argue that the DBO Contractor would then have to suffer from the consequences of having a low Operation Service \nprice, possibly lower than the actual cost, hence why would he/she do this? Or, taking it the other way around, why not leave \nhim/her to be held to his/her bargain and to suffer from the financial consequences of an Operation Service bid price being below \nthe actual cost?\n\nThe difficulty with this line of thinking is that the Bidder can also artificially increase the DB component of his/her bid price to \ncompensate the loss he/she would make on the Operation Service side of the job. In the example above, the Bidder could bring \nhis/her DB price from 50 to 57.5 to compensate the loss of 7.5 on the 5-years of O&M period under the Contract. The whole life \ncycle cost evaluation of his/her bid would give, as a result: 57.5 (DB) + 0.5x25 (O&M) = 70, which is still more competitive than \nthe prudent Bidder coming up at 100, and without any financial loss for the clever Bidder. \n\nBy applying this approach, the clever Bidder would indeed take advantage of the whole life cycle cost evaluation formula for \ngetting an undue competitive advantage since, all things being equal i.e., assuming the hypothetical case where 2 bids are \nexactly the same and coming from 2 equally competent and experienced Bidders, that clever Bidder would get such competitive \nadvantage (70 instead of 100 \u2013 hence 30 artificially \u201ccheaper\u201d than the prudent Bidder) just by spreading his/her Bid price in \nsuch a way which allows him/her to take full advantage of the formula. However, once the DBO Contract is completed, this is the \nEmployer who will have to bear the real O&M cost of 2 per year. The table below illustrates this issue, showing that:\n\n-\u2002despite the same nominal Bid Price between Bid 1 and Bid 2;\n\n-\u2002 Bid 2 wins based on the whole life cycle cost approach, as abused by Bidder 2 since it misrepresents to the Employer that it will \n\nnominally amount to 70 while it should actually be 100 i.e., same as for Bid 1; and\n\n-\u2002while Bid 2 actually ends up being a most expensive solution than Bid 1, on a present value comparison basis.\n\nOne remedy for this situation could be to define a threshold (such as when the Operation Service period is less than 5 years for \nexample) below which the whole life cycle cost evaluation would not apply. However, this would bring the Employer back to the \nusual problem of DB contracts: having a Bidder coming in with an aggressive/low Bid price for the DB component, and not being \nbothered by the possible high Operation Service costs in the long run since those would be financially borne by the Employer. This \nis illustrated under the second table below, where the low CAPEX/high OPEX Bid gets selected although it proves to cost more to \nthe Employer over the life cycle of the facility.\n\n\fEVALUATION AND QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\n337\n\n Bidder 1\n(normal) \n\nBidder 2 \n(artificially low \nOPEX)\n\nBidder 2 \nActual life cycle cost to the

He/she would be more \ncompetitive, hence would be selected against a higher CAPEX/lower OPEX alternative Bid, hence depriving the Employer of \nthe benefit of such latter Bid which brings higher economic benefits for the Employer over the life span of the facility.\n\nThe whole life cycle costs evaluation is the method which makes the utmost economic sense for the Employer in the long run, hence \nit is recommended to the Employer to keep using it even with short Operation Service Periods but, in such cases, to strengthen the \nperformance damages associated to the Operation Service expenditure to avoid the aforementioned bias.\n\nIndeed, as an example, the Operation Service Price on WTP and WWTP is prominently determined by two factors as follows:\n\n-\u2002 the payment the Employer will make to the Contractor for the electricity consumption, which derives from the Guaranteed \n\nMaximum Energy Consumption Rate which the Contractor commits to with his/her Bid, and\n\n-\u2002the chemical consumption costs incurred.\n\n\f338\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nThe Contract already provides for severe consequences to the Contractor in case he/she breaches his/her obligation as to the \nGuaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate:\n\n-\u2002 during the Operation Service Period, the Contractor will not be reimbursed of any electricity paid for in excess to that \n\nguaranteed maximum consumption\u2014see Appendix 1 of the PCC Part B; and\n\n-\u2002 the Contractor will be liable to pay the additional cost that breach will generate to the Employer over the residual life span of the \nfacility beyond the Contract completion, as per the performance damages mechanism laid down under GCC Subclause 11.11 \n[Failure to Pass Tests Prior to Contract Completion] and under Appendix 2 to the PCC Part B. \n\nIt is recommended to the Employer to apply the same mechanism for chemicals, hence:\n\n-\u2002 requiring the Contractor to commit on Guaranteed Maximum Chemical Consumption Rates\u2014this will require amending the \n\nSchedule of Performance Guarantees and setting-up a new Price Schedule (5.4) under Price Schedule 5\u2014see the guidance note \nto that effect under Section 4 of this Bidding Document, Preamble to the Price Schedules\n\n-\u2002 developing the same payment mechanism (under Appendix 1 to the PCC Part B) and the same performance damages \n\nmechanism (under Appendix 2 to the PCC Part B) as applied for electricity \n\nAs a corollary to the above, in case of short Operation Service Periods, and in order to avoid any distortion of/bias to the whole \nlife cycle costs Bid evaluation methodology, the Employer should require guarantees from the Contractor as to electricity and \nchemicals consumption rates, which are the two highest cost items in the operation of a WTP or WWTP, and should develop \nin the Contract the relevant payment deductions during the Operation Service Period, and performance damages upon its \ncompletion. This would, in effect, act as a deterrent to the Contractor to propose artificially low Operation Service Prices, as \nthis would make him/her otherwise suffer from severe financial consequences.\n\n\fEVALUATION AND QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\n339\n\n3.3\u2003Contractor\u2019s Overhead and Profit for Compensation events\n\nMultiply  the  Bidder\u2019s  proposed  percentages  in  the  Schedule  of  overhead  and  profit  to  the  Bid  amount  for  the \nDesign\u2013Build of Works (which is the sum of Price Schedules Nos. 1 to 4), and add this to the Bid price for evaluation.\n\nnOte\n\nDefining such overhead and profit components under the Contract is found to be a positive measure, which will contribute to \navoid practical difficulties in contract administration when it comes to valuating claims and Variations.\n\nOwing to the long-term contractual arrangement at stake, and the risk profile borne by the Contractor under this DBO \nContract for the benefit of the Employer, it is found preferable to leave it to the Contractor to set such percentages.\n\nThis will furthermore enable the Employer to benefit from competitive overhead and profit percentage proposal from the Bidder, \nsince the percentages selected will have an impact on the economic evaluation of the Bid.\n\n3.4\u2003Work, services, facilities, etc., to Be Provided by the employer\n\nWhere Bids include the undertaking of work or the provision of services or facilities by the Employer in excess of \nthe provisions allowed for in the Bidding Document, the Employer shall assess the costs of such additional work, \nservices, and/or facilities during the duration of the Contract, and factor for those when calculating the whole life \ncycle costs under the preceding part. Such costs shall be added to the Bid price for evaluation.\n\n3.5\u2003Domestic Preference\n\nIf domestic preference applies as per BDS 53.1, then the following shall apply. Otherwise, there shall be no Bid \nprice adjustment on the account of domestic preference.\n\nA domestic preference will be granted to eligible domestically produced Plant and Materials in accordance with the \nfollowing provisions:\n\n(a)  The preference margin shall not be applied to the whole facility but only to the eligible domestically produced \n\nPlant and Materials within the Contract.\n\n(b)  Plant and mandatory spare parts supplied from abroad shall be quoted CIP (Section 4, Bidding Forms, Price \nSchedule No. 1) and Plant and mandatory spare parts supplied from within the Employer\u2019s country shall be \nquoted EXW (ex works, ex factory, ex warehouse, ex showroom, or off-the-shelf, as applicable) free of sales \nand similar taxes (Section 4, Bidding Forms, Price Schedule No. 2).\n\n(c)  All other cost components for services and works such as costs for design, local handling, transportation, \nstorage, installation, commissioning, operation, and asset replacement shall be quoted separately (Section \n4, Bidding Forms, Schedule No. 3 to No. 7).\n\n(d) \n\nIn the comparison of Bids, only the CIP price component of each Bid for the Plant and Materials offered from \noutside the Employer\u2019s country shall be increased by 15%.\n\n(e)  No domestic preference shall be applied to any of the services or works included in the Contract.\n\n(f)  Bidders shall not be permitted or required to modify the mix of local and foreign Plant and Materials after Bid \n\nopening.\n\n3.6\u2003specific Additional Criteria\n\nThe following additional criteria will be used in the evaluation: [detail those as need be]\n\n\f340\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\n4.\u2003Multiple Contracts\n\nIf Works are grouped in multiple contracts and pursuant to ITB 49.4, the Employer will evaluate and compare Bids \nbased on a Contract, or a combination of Contracts, or as a total of Contracts to arrive at the least cost combination \nfor the Employer by taking into account discounts offered by Bidders in case of award of multiple contracts.\n\nIf  a  Bidder,  as  defined  in  ITB  1.3  and  in  ITB  4.1,  submits  several  successful  (lowest  evaluated  substantially \nresponsive)  Bids,  the  evaluation  will  also  include  an  assessment  of  the  Bidder\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  the  following \naggregated requirements as presented in the bid:\n\n\u2022\t Average annual turnover,\n\n\u2022\t\n\nFinancial resources,\n\n\u2022\t Contractor\u2019s Equipment to be allocated, and \n\n\u2022\t Contractor\u2019s Personnel to be fielded.\n\nnOte\n\nThe Employer shall refer to the applicable qualification requirement(s) for each

By preparing their Bid, the Bidders shall then be fully aware that:\n\n(a)  Those guaranteed values will be used for the determination of the Bid Price based on the forms \ndeveloped  in  this  Section  of  the  Bidding  Document,  and  for  the  determination  of  the  lowest \nevaluated substantially responsive Bid as per the evaluation methodology defined in Section 3 of \nthe Bidding Document, and\n\n(b) \n\nthose guaranteed values will be used for the determination of payments under the Contract, as per \nthe provisions of Appendix 1 [Schedule of Payment] to the Particular Conditions of Contract Part B\n\n(c)  Failure to reach those values, during the Contract implementation, will also make the Contractor \nliable to pay damages to the Employer in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 2 [Performance \nDamages] to the Particular Conditions of Contract Part B, GCC Subclause 10.7 [Failure to Reach \nProduction Outputs] and GCC Subclause 11.11 [Failure to Pass Tests Prior to Contract Completion].\n\nPrice Schedules Structure\n\n Schedules 1 to 4 include Rates and Price to be paid to the Contractor for the Design\u2013Build Period under \nthe Contract. The total amount of these Schedules will constitute the lump sum amount for the Design\u2013\nBuild of the Works.\n\n Schedule 5 and 6 include Rates and Prices to be paid to the Contractor for the Operation Service Period \nunder  the  Contract.  The  total  amount  of  this  Schedule  will  constitute  the  amount  for  the  Operation \nService, which is composed of fixed and variable fees, as detailed below.\n\n Schedule  7  include  Rates  and  Prices  to  be  paid  to  the  Contractor  for  the  Asset  Replacement  under \nthe  Contract.  The  total  amount  of  this  Schedule  will  constitute  the  lump  sum  amount  for  the  Asset \nReplacement Fund.\n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n\fBIDDING FORMS\n\n351\n\nOperation Service Period\n\n12. \n\n13. \n\nSchedule 5 is composed of fixed and variable fees, as follows.\n\n Schedule 5.1 reflects annual fixed fees which are deemed to cover the expenses incurred by the Contractor \nfor  providing  the  Operation  Service,  regardless  of  and  whatever  the  actual  production  output  of  the \ntreatment plant is. Typically, this will cover the following, without necessarily being limited to, Contractor\u2019s \ncost items:\n\n(a)  Maintenance and replacement, for all aspects not covered by the Asset Replacement Fund according \n\nto the provisions of GCC Subclause 14.18\n\n(b)  Personnel (administration, management, etc.)\n\n(c)  Facilities (offices, warehouses, accommodation, workshops, etc.)\n\n(e) \n\nInsurances, guarantees, financial services, support services\n\n(d)  Equipment\n\n(f)  Overheads and profit\n\n14. \n\n Schedule 5.2 reflects variable fees which are deemed to cover the expenses incurred by the Contractor \nfor providing the Operation Service and which vary depending on the actual production output of the \ntreatment plant. Typically, this will cover the following, without necessarily being limited to, Contractor\u2019s \ncost items:\n\n(a)  Maintenance and replacement, for all aspects not covered by the Asset Replacement Fund according \n\nto the provisions of GCC Subclause 14.18\n\n(b)  Chemicals\n\n(d)  Facilities\n\n(c)  Personnel (management, operation, etc.)\n\n15. \n\n Schedule 5.3 reflects prices to be paid to the Contractor for the electricity he/she will use for the Operation \nService Period and which he/she will pay to the local grid/power Supplier. This is based on:\n\n(a) \n\nthe average energy tariff prior to bidding stage, which will be filled in by the Employer; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nthe forecast production of the plant, in m3, over the years of the Operation Service Period, also filled \nin by the Employer; and\n\nthe Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate, which is the maximum consumption of energy \nper m3 of production as committed by the Bidder through the Schedule of Performance Guarantees.\n\n16. \n\n As per the Schedule of Payments, appended to the Particular Conditions of Contract, the Employer bears \nthe risk of the electricity tariff fluctuation but only up to the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption. \nIf the facility designed, built and operated by the Contractor proves to consume more energy per m3 of \nproduction than the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate, the cost of electricity in excess \nof  that  Rate  shall  be  borne  by  the  Contractor.  However,  if  the  Contractor  manages  to  achieve  lower \nconsumption  rates  than  guaranteed  under  the  Contract,  the  annual  electricity  cost  savings  this  will \ngenerate to the Employer will be equally shared in between the Parties.\n\n\f352\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nnOtes\n\nSplitting the Operation Service payment in between fixed and variable fees brings the required flexibility to deal with all production \nsituations which may occur due to, for example, different water supply demands or wastewater inflows than anticipated by \nthe Employer based on the Feasibility Study, since under DBO Contracts the Contractor does not bear the commercial risk of \nthe facility. If the facility produces less than anticipated for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor, a fair and reasonable \nmechanism must be in place to make sure he/she is paid for his/her fixed fees.\n\nInternational experience shows that it is preferable for the Employer to bear the risk of electricity tariff fluctuations in DBO \nContracts for water and wastewater treatment plants. The same principle can be extrapolated to other kind of water and \nwastewater infrastructure. This would otherwise lead to adverse risk premiums which would negatively impact the Contract Price. \nThe Contractor is on the other hand required to contractually commit to what he/she can reasonably control\u2014the maximum \nenergy consumption rate per m3 of production. \n\nAn incentive is also provided to the Contractor for endeavouring to do better than contracted in term of energy consumption \nrate. A lower rate will bring savings to the Employer as he/she will pay less electricity costs than he/she would have had to if the \nelectricity consumption was at the level of the Guaranteed Maximum Energy Consumption Rate. Such savings are shared with the \nContractor, to align the Employer and the Contractor\u2019s objectives through such win-win arrangement.\n\nIt should be noted that the Employer may wish to apply the same principles for chemicals consumption, since it is another major \ncost item within the operating expenditure of a facility. Indeed, the Employer may then wish to:\n\n\u2022\u2002bear\tthe\trisk\tof\tthe\trelevant\tchemical\ttariff\tfluctuation\tbut\tonly\tup\tto\tthe\tGuaranteed\tMaximum\tEnergy\tConsumption;\n\n\u2022\u2002\tmake\tthe\tContractor\tliable\tfor\tcost\toverrun\tin\tcase\tthe\tactual\tchemical\tconsumption\texceeds\tthe\tGuaranteed\tMaximum\t\n\nChemical Consumption defined by the Contractor in his/her bid; and\n\n\u2022\u2002\tshare\tthe\tsavings\tmade\tby\tthe\tEmployer\tin\tcase\tthe\trelevant\tchemical\tconsumption\tfalls\tbelow\tthe\trelevant\tGuaranteed\t\n\nMaximum Consumption Rate, as an incentive for the Contractor to do better than committed in his/her Bid and in Contract.\n\nIn such case, the Employer should:\n\n-\u2002Introduce a Schedule 5.4, in similar terms as those used under Schedule 5.3 for electricity.\n\n-\u2002 Amend Schedule 5 to accommodate for an additional column reflecting the Contractor\u2019s Chemicals Payment, which will \n\ncapture price data flowing from Schedule 5.4.\n\n-\u2002 Insert Key Performance Indicators related to chemicals, if and as need be under the Employer\u2019s Requirements (section 4 \n\nthereunder) and the Schedule of Performance Guarantees.\n\n-\u2002 Amend the PCC Part B Appendix 1 and 2 to introduce similar terms for chemicals payment and performance damages as the \n\nones used for electricity payment and performance damages.\n\nThe attention of the Employer is drawn to the fact that introducing too many constraints to the bidders on Guaranteed \nMaximum Chemical Consumption Rates can lead to the adverse result that the design and engineering added values of the \nbidders are undermined. The more maximum consumption rates are defined by the Employer (for example with a WTP: on \naluminium sulphate, organic polymers, chlorine, ozone, etc.), the less flexibility bidders will have to propose their most fit for \npurpose design solution meeting the Employer\u2019s Requirements. As much as possible, the Employer should resist the temptation \nof becoming too prescriptive on such matters, as otherwise the Employer will progressively lose the full strength of the DBO \nprocurement process and contracting arrangement. It might indeed well be that one design and engineering solution would, for \nexample, exceed a Key Performance Indicator maximum value introduced for chemicals, and would then have to be discarded, \ndespite being a more attractive solution on capital expenditure and on energy expenditure under a whole life cycle costs approach \nthan a solution being fully compliant with over-prescriptive Employer\u2019s Requirements. \n\nUnder the latter approach, matters such as capital and operating expenditure should not be considered in isolation, but \nalways under an integrated manner. Accordingly, Key Performance Indicators can be introduced for energy and/or chemical \nconsumptions, but care should be given before setting a KPI maximum value. Nothing indeed prevents the Employer to introduce \na KPI with no imposed maximum value, hence for which full flexibility is given to the Bidder to set in his/her Bid the guaranteed \nvalue he/she deems suitable. That is then that guaranteed value which will be monitored during the Contract implementation, \nand any excess to that value will make the Contractor subject to nonpayment under Appendix 1 of the PCC Part B, and/or \nperformance damages under Appendix 2 of the PCC Part B.\n\n\fBIDDING FORMS\n\n353\n\nasset replacement Fund and Schedule\n\nThe Contractor will be responsible to proceed with Asset Replacement during the Operation Service Period, based \non the Asset Replacement Schedule inserted in the Price Schedule 7.1 and through the financing of the Asset \nReplacement Fund inserted in the Price Schedule 7, all in accordance with the provisions of the GCC Subclause \n14.5 [Asset Replacement Schedule] and 14.18 [Asset Replacement Fund]\n\nnOtes\n\nThe Contractor will be liable for any Asset Replacement occurring earlier than anticipated in the Asset Replacement Schedule, \nsince payment will not be made to the Contractor before the date stated in such Schedule, in accordance with the provisions of \nGCC Subclause 14.5.\n\nSavings against the Asset Replacement Fund, at the end of the Operation Service Period, will be determined and shared in \nbetween the Parties as per the procedure defined in the GCC Subclause 14.18.

Indeed, various production conditions can lead to different cost structures. \nConsequently, there can be several sets of Schedules 5.2 and 5.3 (and 5.4, if any) that can be used by the Bidder to reflect the \nspecificities of this process.

Its \noperation is governed by the terms of GCC Subclause 14.5 and Subclause 14.18 and further explained below.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tAt\tbidding\tstage,\tthe\tBidder\twill\tdefine\tan\tAsset\tReplacement\tSchedule,\twhich\tis\treflected\tunder\tthe\tPrice\tSchedule\t7.1\t\nabove. This Asset Replacement Schedule sets, for each major asset within the facility, when its replacement is scheduled \nover the Operation Service Period. A price is reflected in the Bid for that replacement at that scheduled date. In effect, \nthis means the Bidder represents to the Employer that that asset will not have to be replaced before the replacement date \ninserted by the Bidder under the Asset Replacement Schedule, and, when it is to be replaced, the Employer will have to \npay the price stated in the Bid for that replacement.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tAccordingly,\tfrom\tthe\tEmployer\u2019s\tperspective,\tthe\tasset\treplacement\tis\tset\tin\ttime\tand\tprice\tfrom\tthe outset of the \n\nContract implementation, as follows:\n\no\u2002 the Bidder who becomes Contractor will be paid the price he/she filled in his/her Bid (and which now forms part of \nthe Contract), whatever the actual cost of the replacement is when replacement is to be made. I.e., whether the \nactual cost is higher or lower than the price in the Bid does not make any difference\u2014the Contractor remains paid \nthat price,\n\no\u2002 the Bidder who becomes Contractor will be paid the price he/she filled in his/her Bid (and which now forms part \nof the Contract) if the replacement date scheduled in the Asset Replacement Schedule is met, and when the \nreplacement is actually made. Consequently, if an asset is to be replaced earlier than scheduled (for whatever \nreason, such as a defect in the manufacturing of the asset, or improper operation and maintenance practices), then \nno payment is made to the Contractor until such time the scheduled replacement date occurs. The Contractor \ntherefore suffers from the cash flow consequences of having to replace an asset earlier than what he/she declared in \nthe Contract, for the period ranging from the actual date of replacement until the date set in the Asset Replacement \nSchedule.  \n\no\u2002 On the other hand, if a replacement turns out to be required later than the date set in the Asset Replacement \n\nSchedule (for various reasons, such as a better life expectancy than envisaged caused by design or operation and \nmaintenance practices optimization), then replacement payment is only done when the replacement is actually \nmade, and not at the date set in the Asset Replacement Schedule.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tAll\tsums\tto\tbe\tpaid,\tas\tper\tthe\tAsset\tReplacement\tSchedule,\tare\tthen\tconsolidated\ton\ta\tyearly\tbasis\tin\tthe\tAsset\t\n\nReplacement Fund (Price Schedule 7) which summarizes payment the Employer is planned to make on a yearly basis for \nall asset replacement under the Contract\n\n\u2022\u2002Note\tthat\tthe\tAsset\tReplacement\tFund\tdoes\tnot\tcover\tthe\tcosts\tof:\n\no\u2002 routine maintenance items associated with the correction of defects;\n\no\u2002 replacement of Plant and Material which have a life expectancy of less than five years, which explains why the \n\nAsset Replacement Fund and Schedule start at Year 6 into the Operation Service Period;\n\no\u2002 providing spares between scheduled dates for major plant replacement; and\n\no\u2002 the replacement of Plant and Materials which are not identified in the Asset Replacement Schedule.\n\nAll such costs are deemed to be covered by the Price Schedule 5 \u2013 Operation Service.\n\nAs can be seen from the above, this mechanism provides the Employer with an early price certainty as to the cost of asset \nreplacement over the Operation Service Period under the Contract.\n\n\f372\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nAn example is given below to further illustrate this mechanism.\n\n\u2022\u2002Assume\ta\ttreatment\tplant\tbased\ton\tmembrane\tprocesses,\twith\ta\t12-year\tOperation\tService\tPeriod.\n\n\u2022\u2002The\tContractor,\tthrough\tthe\tAsset\tReplacement\tSchedule,\tdeclared\tthe\tplanned\treplacement\tof:\n\no\u2002a first set of cartridge filters in the 6th year into the Operation Service Period,\n\no\u2002a second set in the 8th year, and\n\no\u2002a set of dosing pumps and actuators in the 11th year.\n\n\u2022\u2002During\tthe\tOperation\tService\tPeriod,\tthe\tfollowing\toccurs:\n\no\u2002 The first set of cartridge filters is to be replaced in the 5th year, hence earlier than in Contract, and for a higher cost \nto the Contractor than the price set in the Asset Replacement Schedule and Fund. The Contractor will only get paid \nin the 6th year, and only of the price set in the Asset Replacement Schedule and Fund. Accordingly, the Contractor \nsuffers from a cost overrun (the difference in between the actual replacement cost, and the replacement price in \nContract), and from a payment 1 year later than when the replacement costs are actually incurred.  \n\no\u2002 The second set of cartridge filters is to be replaced in the 8th year, right as per what was planned in the Asset \n\nReplacement Schedule. Replacement cost is lower than the replacement price set in Contract. Nevertheless, the \nContractor gets paid of that price and benefits from the savings, i.e., from the difference in between price set in \nContract and the actual replacement cost.\n\no\u2002 Dosing pumps and actuators are to be replaced in the 12th year, hence a year later than set in the Asset \n\nReplacement Schedule, and for a cost corresponding to the price set in Contract. The Contractor does not get paid \nas per the date set in the Asset Replacement Schedule, i.e., in the 11th year, but when the replacement is done i.e., \nin the 12th year.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tPrior\tto\tthe\tissue\tof\tthe\tContract\tCompletion\tCertificate,\ta\tcomparison\tis\tmade\tin\tbetween\tthe\tactual\tdepreciation\t\nof the assets listed in the Asset Replacement Schedule, against the depreciation which was initially expected under \nthe Schedule. Assets which had to be replaced later than envisaged do generate a gain for the Employer since asset \ndepreciation is then lower than expected, while those which had to be replaced earlier generate a loss owing to a higher \ndepreciation mechanism.

This is also used under the Appendix 2 \n[Performance Damages] of the PCC Part B, where any remaining failure by the Contractor to meet this KPI will expose him/\nher to pay to the Employer, in case of failure to pass the Tests Prior to Contract Completion, the additional electricity cost \nwhich will be suffered by the Employer over the remaining life span of the facility after completion of the Operation Service \nPeriod and of the Contract. \n\nThe Guaranteed Maximum Chemical Consumption Rate reflects another major operating expenditure, which should be \nconsidered for use by the Employer. Key Performance Indicators can be introduced for chemical consumptions, but care should \nbe given before setting a KPI maximum value for the reasons laid down in the Guidance Note under the Preamble of the Price \nSchedules.

Civil works (basins, tanks, etc.) generally have a life span of 50 years, while electrical and mechanical \nequipment are more in the range of 10 to 20 years, and it is recommended to set the life expectancy of the facility as being a \nperiod going over the life expectancy of most of the electrical and mechanical equipment. \n\nOverall, 25 years for a plant is considered reasonable and in line with international practice since over that period the \nnecessary technology upgrades made (to cope with science, technology, practices, legal, and regulatory environment \nevolutions) are likely to make that the resulting plant has little to be compared to the initial plant as designed and built by the \nContractor.\n\nThe life expectancy filled in by the Employer will serve the purpose of calculating the whole life cycle cost of the facility based \non the Contractor\u2019s Price Bid, as per Section 3 of this Bidding Document, as well as performance damages under Appendix 2 of \nthe Particular Conditions of Contract Part B.\n\nName of Bidder ____________________________\n\nSignature of Bidder __________________________\n\n\f384\n\nUSER\u2019S GUIDE TO DESIGN\u2013BUILD\u2013OPERATE CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER  \nGREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS\n\nBid Security\n\nBank Guarantee\n\n[insert bank\u2019s name, and address of issuing branch or office]1\n\nName of Contract/Contract No.   \n\n \n\n    ___________________________________\n\nName and address of Beneficiary (\u201cthe Employer\u201d): ___________________________________\n\nWe have been informed that [name of the Contractor] (hereinafter called the \u201cPrincipal\u201d) is submitting a Bid for \nthe above-named Contract in response to your invitation, and the instructions to Bidders (hereinafter \u201cthe \nITB\u201d) require that this Bid is supported by a Bid Security.\n\nAt the request of the Principal, we [name of bank] hereby irrevocably undertake to pay you, the Beneficiary/\nEmployer, any sum not exceeding in total the amount of  [amount in words] [amount in figures] upon receipt by \nus of your demand in writing with your written statement (in the demand) stating that:\n(a) \n\nthe  Principal  has,  without  your  agreement,  withdrawn  his/her  Bid  after  the  latest  time  specified  for  its \nsubmission and before the expiry of its period of validity, or \n\n(b) \n\nthe Principal has refused to accept the correction of errors in his/her Bid in accordance with the ITB, or\n\n(c)  you  awarded  the  Contract  to  the  Principal  and  he/she  has  failed  to  comply  with  Subclause  1.6  [Contract \n\nAgreement] of the Conditions of Contract, or\n\n(d)  you awarded the Contract to the Principal and he/she has failed to comply with Subclause 4.2 [Performance \n\nSecurity] or Subclause 4.2A [Parent Company Guarantee] of the Conditions of Contract.\n\nAny demand for payment must contain your signature(s) which must be authenticated by your bankers or by \na notary public.

The FIDIC Gold Book operates on the basis of three main levels of design, as defined in the FIDIC DBO \nContract Guide, 2011 Edition:\n\n1.\u2002 Conceptual design (if any) which might be included in the Employer\u2019s Requirements, and which consists of a simple layout \n\nwith possibly basic dimensions and defined criteria to identify the Works sufficiently for tenderers to be able to understand and \ndevelop the requirements in order to prepare a responsive tender. Note that setting a conceptual design, and possibly imposing \na base solution to be complied with by Bidders, is not mandatory and the Employer may only specify requirements to be \ncomplied with by Bidders (performance of the plant, etc.) and leave full flexibility to Bidders to freely propose their best fit-for-\npurpose design engineering solution.\n\n2.\u2002 Preliminary design of the technological solution proposed by the Bidders, and to be inserted in their Bid. The level of detail \n\nrequired in the preliminary design should be stated in the Bidding Document but it should be that necessary for the Employer to \nbe able to understand the Bid from the Bidder. Bidders should not be asked for an elaborate detailed design at this stage, since \nthis would be expensive to produce and a corresponding excessive economic burden for all except the successful Bidder.\n\n3.\u2002 Detailed/final design stage is that made by the Contractor as part of his/her obligations under the Contract. Unless any \n\nchanges have been agreed prior to the Contract award this will usually be a development of his/her preliminary design and will \nbecome a part of the Contractor\u2019s Documents (as defined under GCC Subclause 1.1.19).\n\nIt is fully recognized that different countries use different terminology and procedures for design, and it is down to the Employer \nto adapt the wording used above, and the various design stages, to fit the prevailing situation for the project, based on applicable \nlaws, regulations, and practices.  \n\nNo specific format and structure is imposed for the Technical Proposal, however it is suggested, for ease of evaluation of the \nconformity of the Technical Proposal with the Employer\u2019s Requirements, that a similar structure to the latter is adopted by the \nBidder.\n\nThe Technical Proposal is expected in particular to include as a minimum, though not being limited to, the following contractual \nwarranties, representations, and statements of information:\n\n\u2022\u2002\tThe\tdetails\tof\tthe\tContractor\u2019s\tproposed\tdesign\tengineering\tsolution\tfor\tthe\tplant.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tThe\tOperation\tand\tMaintenance\tPlan\tproposed\tby\tthe\tBidder\twhich\tfulfils\tthe\tOperation\tManagement\tRequirements\t\n\ncontained in the Employer\u2019s Requirements.\n\n\u2022\u2002The\tContractor\u2019s\tmethod\tstatements\tfor\tthe\tDesign\u2013Build\tPeriod.\n\n\u2022\u2002The\tBidder\u2019s\tproposed\tSite\torganisation.\n\n\u2022\u2002\tThe\tlist\tof\tproposed\tSubcontractors\tand\tSuppliers\tof\tPlant\tunder\tthe\tContract,\tin\tfurtherance\tto\tthe\tConditions\tof\tContract\t\n\nSubclause 4.4 and which have their origin in eligible source countries as defined under Section 5 of this Bidding Document.
