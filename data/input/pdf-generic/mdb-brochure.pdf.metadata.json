In this way, \nthe NBF helped to deliver reforms which generate an expected US$10 million in private sector savings.\nBy aligning business and development objectives, many companies are maximizing their impact. IADB\u2019s Shared Value \nProducts give clients tailor-made business advisory services focused on developing competitive business strategies \nthat generate social value and sustainable impact. \nEBRD\u2019s Sustainable Energy Financing Facilities channel support through local financial institutions that allows \nbusinesses and households to make investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, helping them generate \nmedium-term savings while delivering on climate objectives. \nExamples of innovative financial instruments include the Global Agriculture and Food Security programme, of which IFC \nP2430_M5_motorway_119.jpg\nmanages the private sector component. This can provide first-loss cover for loans taken out by smallholders, to make \nthem more attractive creditors. In Mexico, the IADB supported the first issuance of education bonds, helping create a \nnew asset class and increasing capital market investments for poor students.

(See Box 2)\nKnowledge-sharing and South-South cooperation\nIn line with the commitments arising from both the Busan Partnership and \nthe G20 Development Working Group, over the past years MDBs have been \nsupporting country-led efforts to scale up South-South Cooperation (SSC) \nand Knowledge Sharing (KS). MDBs have advanced significantly in supporting \ninstitutional and operational development in partner countries, acting as \nknowledge brokers, developing knowledge-exchange tools, and supporting \nknowledge-exchange communities (see Box 3). \nBox 3: Knowledge-sharing and South-South cooperation examples\nInstitutional and operational development: MDBs have started to support knowledge hubs, which are \norganizations able to document and share development experience with domestic and international partners. Pilots \nare underway in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and Nigeria. In 2012, a High-Level Meeting on knowledge hubs was held \nin Bali, and a second will take place in Seoul in June 2014 in collaboration with AsDB, IsDB, WB and others. \nBrokering and networking: The AsDB-IADB Technical Cooperation platform, launched in 2012, gathers about \n1,000 representatives engaged with issues such as climate change, inclusive business  or social welfare systems. \nIsDB uses the Reverse Linkages Program (started in 2011) to promote knowledge-sharing among member countries, \ne.g. through twinning arrangements, which in the Indonesia-Senegal case is coordinated with the WB.\nThe how-to of knowledge exchange: \u201cThe Art of Knowledge Exchange\u201d is an easy-to-understand yet \ncomprehensive guide on how to plan and implement result-oriented KS. Initiated by the WB, this approach has been \ndiscussed with AsDB and IsDB, and remains open to any partners desiring to ensure the impact of SSC and KS.\nNetworking and communities: Using social media technology, communities of practice have emerged in specific \nSSC areas. Launched in 2013, knowledgehubs.org currently has 438 members from 53 countries who address \ninstitutional and operational challenges of SSC and KS. WB is a founding member, and AsDB coordinates the  \nAsia-Pacific chapter. MDBs have also led webinars and are contributing contents. In addition, MDBs are also \nengaged in the South-South Opportunity at southsouth.info (since 2009), where 2,108 members from 123 countries \nshare solutions around the policy and practice of SSC, KS and triangular cooperation.\nk\nn\na\nB\nnt \ne\nm\np\no\nel o\nAsian Dev san Becci\nPhoto by  \u00a9IFAD/Su\n5", "Engagement in the Global \nPartnership for Effective \nDevelopment Cooperation  \n(GPEDC) process\n\u2022   Global level: Since Busan, under the GPEDC, MDBs have continued the \ntradition of coordinating and collaborating closely, with the World Bank \ncurrently representing the MDB group in the Global Partnership Steering \nCommittee (SC).\n\u2022   Country level: MDBs have been actively disseminating information \nabout the Global Partnership and facilitating dialogue on aid effectiveness \npriority issues.

AsDB has included two GPMF \ns \noto indicators: use of country results frameworks, and use of country public \nh\nP\nfinance management systems and national procurement procedures. It is \ncommitted to track its performance on these indicators annually as a part \nof its Development Effectiveness Review report. \nMDBs will continue to support the piloting of indicators at the global level \n(for example on civil society organisations engagement, private sector \nparticipation), the methodologies for which are being refined. MDBs country \noffices have also worked closely with partner country governments to \nsupport them in preparing data for the Global Partnership monitoring survey.\n\u2022   High Level Meeting (HLM) in Mexico: MDBs have been both supporting \npartner countries in their preparation for the HLM, and worked in \npartnership with the organisers to prepare some of the discussions taking \nplace in Mexico, for example on:  \n\u2713  Middle income countries and MDBs: effective development partners\n\u2713  Partnering with private investors for development impact\n\u2713  Fostering knowledge sharing capacity in country institutions\n\u2713  Using country systems and measuring their strength: what\u2019s next?\n\u2713  Multi-stakeholder approaches for enhancing multilateral organisations\u2019 \ncontribution to development results\n6", "The future of the MDB partnership \ntowards and post-2015\n \nMDBs are committed to continue working as a group and in partnership \nwith client countries, including FCS and MICs, towards the implementation \nof the Busan principles and supporting the post-2015 agenda.
