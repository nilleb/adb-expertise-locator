AsDB released an initial set \n\nof aid data in November 2011 through \n\nthe IATI central registry. The latest \n\nupdate of AsDB\u2019s common standard \n\nimplementation schedule was made in \n\nOctober 2013. AsDB also provided an \n\nupdate of machine-readable aid data \n\non a quarterly basis in 2013, with the \n\nlatest update in December 2013. AfDB  \n\npublished its first IATI data in July 2013, \n\nand issued an update in December \n\n2013. IADB began publishing data \n\nthrough IATI in March 2013, and \n\nis moving forward to meet the \n\ncommitment to the common standard \n\nby the end of 2015. IFAD published its \n\nimplementation schedule in May 2013. \n\nThe Fund is actively supporting the IATI \n\nprocess and, in particular, the outreach \n\nprogramme. The WB was a founding \n\nsignatory of IATI  and has published IATI \n\ndata since 2011, and recently made \n\nits publication frequency quarterly. The \n\nEBRD, which has a majority of private \n\nsector operations, has been an active \n\nplayer in the private-sector International \n\nFinance Institution/Development Finance \n\nInstitution working group, which is \n\ndeveloping \u2013 with the IATI secretariat -  \n\na reporting schedule that is appropriate \n\nfor operations with private sector clients.\n\n3\n\no\nr\nt\ns\nu\na\nS\n\nl\n\n \no\nc\nr\na\nM\nD\nA\nF\n\n/\n\nI\n \n\n\u00a9\n\nProgress on the Busan principles  \nOwnership of development priorities by developing countries, focus on results, \nbroader development partnerships, and transparency and accountability \u2013 all \nBusan core principles \u2013 are fully consistent with MDBs\u2019 medium and long-term \nstrategies. MDBs have taken concrete measures to further mainstream these \nprinciples in their institutional frameworks and operations. \n\nCountry ownership \nCountry ownership is essential to achieving development effectiveness, and \nMDBs remain committed to this principle. Their business models are country- \nand client-driven, and priorities are identified in coordination with the \ncountries themselves and other development partners. Country strategies take \nshape through a collaborative dialogue that ensures country involvement and \nownership throughout the process. Furthermore, the private sector, civil society \nand other stakeholders are involved in the consultations on the country strategy, \nas well as in its implementation. This approach enables the development of \njoint objectives by all partners, and can contribute to establishing joint  \nlonger-term goals such as national targets for the implementation of the  \npost-2015 agenda.\n\nTransparency \nMDBs have increased transparency and instituted new policies on access to \ninformation, making more data and information publicly available, therefore \nfurthering accountability. Four MDBs have been ranked in the top 11 among \nthe 67 institutions in the latest assessment of Publish What You Fund, a global \ncampaign for transparency. \n\nMany MDBs are signatories of the International Aid Transparency initiative \n(IATI). They are committed to the IATI Accra Statement on improving the \navailability and accessibility of information on aid flow and to implementing \nthe IATI common standard fully by December 2015. MDBs are making good \nprogress towards this aim (see Box 1), and recognize the need to address \n\n\f1303_Georgia_1524.jpg\n\n1402_Czech_Rep_0476.JPG\n\n1402_Czech_Rep_2538.JPG\n\nKosovo_1310_0803copy.jpg\n\nP2430_M5_motorway_087.jpg\n\nP2430_M5_motorway_110.jpg\n\nBanks 71.5, 7%\n\nt\nn\ne\nm\np\no\ne\nv\ne\nD\n\nl\n\n \n\nd\nn\na\n \nn\no\ni\nt\nc\nu\nr\nt\ns\nn\no\nc\ne\nR\n\n \nr\no\n\nf\n \nk\nn\na\nB\n\n \nn\na\ne\np\no\nr\nu\nE\n\n \n \ny\nb\n\n \no\nt\no\nh\nP\n\nexisting challenges to the full implementation of IATI standards.

These frameworks are key to enhancing accountability and \nevidence-based decision-making. MDBs are engaged in an ongoing dialogue on \nresults through the MDB Working Group on Managing for Development Results. \nSince 2005, the Group has developed the Common Standard Assessment System \nto track MDBs capacity to manage for development results (see: www.mfdr.org). \nMDBs are also supporting countries in developing country results frameworks as \nthe basis for mutual accountability going forward. \n\nInternational capital flows to \ndeveloping countries, 2012\n(in US$ billions and as a % of total flows)\n\nOther private 7.1, 1%\n\nShort-term \ndebt flows 126.7, 13%\n\nBonds \n143.3, 14%\n\nPortfolio equity \ninflows 44.4, 4%\n\nSource: Long-term financing for growth and development, \nG20 Umbrella Paper, Feb. 2013; and Global Economic Prospects, \n2013, World Bank.\n\nODA & OOF\n14.1, 1%\n\nFDI inflows\n600.1, 60%\n\nEngaging business as a partner in development\nWorking with the private sector to deliver development, has long been a core \ntask for MDBs. Most MDBs provide financing in favour of private enterprises, \ninvesting directly or indirectly (in partnership with local financial institutions) \nin local firms and/or leveraging private finance to complement MDB financing, \nand MDBs have long worked closely with partner governments to improve the \ninvestment climate in all of their partner countries, including Fragile and \nConflict Affected States (FCS) and Middle Income Countries (MICs).  \n\nThis engagement continues to be stepped up, and spans a wide spectrum of \nareas, from developing new platforms for public\u2013private dialogue (PPD), to \ndeveloping catalytic partnerships with private enterprises which deliver \u2018shared \n\nBox 2: Working with the private sector for development impact\n\nIn some countries, Public-Private Dialogue platforms have been crucial to creating an enabling business environment. \n\nDuring Nepal\u2019s post-conflict period, the World Bank\u2019s Nepal Investment Climate Reform Program (NICRP) worked \n\nclosely with the Nepal Business Forum (NBF) - Nepal\u2019s very first public-private business forum including 75 members \n\nfrom across government, business, and civil society \u2013 to generate important support for reforms in areas such as tax \n\nadministration, trade logistics, export promotion, investment facilitation, access to finance, and energy.  In this way, \n\nthe NBF helped to deliver reforms which generate an expected US$10 million in private sector savings.\n\nBy aligning business and development objectives, many companies are maximizing their impact. IADB\u2019s Shared Value \n\nProducts give clients tailor-made business advisory services focused on developing competitive business strategies \n\nthat generate social value and sustainable impact. \n\nEBRD\u2019s Sustainable Energy Financing Facilities channel support through local financial institutions that allows \n\nbusinesses and households to make investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, helping them generate \n\nmedium-term savings while delivering on climate objectives. \n\nExamples of innovative financial instruments include the Global Agriculture and Food Security programme, of which IFC \n\nmanages the private sector component. This can provide first-loss cover for loans taken out by smallholders, to make \n\nthem more attractive creditors. In Mexico, the IADB supported the first issuance of education bonds, helping create a \n\nnew asset class and increasing capital market investments for poor students. AsDB\u2019s Off-Grid Pay-As-You-Go Solar \n\nPower project in India uses text messages to facilitate access to affordable and accessible solar energy to consumers. \n\nFinally, the World Bank participated in the AgResults Initiative, which uses public financing to reward agricultural \n\ninnovation in developing countries and build sustainable markets for agricultural inputs, products and services that \n\nbenefit the poor.\n\n4\n\nP2430_M5_motorway_119.jpg\n\n\fvalue\u2019 i.e. products or business models which deliver development outcomes \nat the same time as making commercial sense, to developing innovative \ninstruments for further leveraging private finance for development. (See Box 2)\n\nKnowledge-sharing and South-South cooperation\nIn line with the commitments arising from both the Busan Partnership and \nthe G20 Development Working Group, over the past years MDBs have been \nsupporting country-led efforts to scale up South-South Cooperation (SSC) \nand Knowledge Sharing (KS). MDBs have advanced significantly in supporting \ninstitutional and operational development in partner countries, acting as \nknowledge brokers, developing knowledge-exchange tools, and supporting \nknowledge-exchange communities (see Box 3). \n\nBox 3: Knowledge-sharing and South-South cooperation examples\n\nInstitutional and operational development: MDBs have started to support knowledge hubs, which are \n\norganizations able to document and share development experience with domestic and international partners. Pilots \n\nare underway in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and Nigeria. In 2012, a High-Level Meeting on knowledge hubs was held \n\nin Bali, and a second will take place in Seoul in June 2014 in collaboration with AsDB, IsDB, WB and others. \n\nBrokering and networking: The AsDB-IADB Technical Cooperation platform, launched in 2012, gathers about \n\n1,000 representatives engaged with issues such as climate change, inclusive business  or social welfare systems. \n\nIsDB uses the Reverse Linkages Program (started in 2011) to promote knowledge-sharing among member countries, \n\ne.g. through twinning arrangements, which in the Indonesia-Senegal case is coordinated with the WB.\n\nThe how-to of knowledge exchange: \u201cThe Art of Knowledge Exchange\u201d is an easy-to-understand yet \n\ncomprehensive guide on how to plan and implement result-oriented KS. Initiated by the WB, this approach has been \n\ndiscussed with AsDB and IsDB, and remains open to any partners desiring to ensure the impact of SSC and KS.\n\nNetworking and communities: Using social media technology, communities of practice have emerged in specific \n\nSSC areas. Launched in 2013, knowledgehubs.org currently has 438 members from 53 countries who address \n\ninstitutional and operational challenges of SSC and KS. WB is a founding member, and AsDB coordinates the  \n\nAsia-Pacific chapter. MDBs have also led webinars and are contributing contents. In addition, MDBs are also \n\nengaged in the South-South Opportunity at southsouth.info (since 2009), where 2,108 members from 123 countries \n\nshare solutions around the policy and practice of SSC, KS and triangular cooperation.\n\nk\nn\na\nB\n\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\np\no\ne\nv\ne\nD\n\nl\n\n \nn\na\ns\nA\n\ni\n\n \ny\nb\n\n \no\nt\no\nh\nP\n\ni\n\no\nc\nc\ne\nB\n\n \nn\na\ns\nu\nS\n/\n\nD\nA\nF\n\u00a9\n\nI\n\n5\n\n\fEngagement in the Global \nPartnership for Effective \nDevelopment Cooperation  \n(GPEDC) process\n\n\u2022   Global level: Since Busan, under the GPEDC, MDBs have continued the \n\ntradition of coordinating and collaborating closely, with the World Bank \n\ncurrently representing the MDB group in the Global Partnership Steering \n\nCommittee (SC).\n\n\u2022   Country level: MDBs have been actively disseminating information \n\nabout the Global Partnership and facilitating dialogue on aid effectiveness \n\npriority issues. They support multi-stakeholder partnerships and ensure \n\nthe availability of timely and comprehensive data on cooperation flows. \n\nMDBs are helping to strengthen the country results frameworks of their \n\npartner countries, and most have signed Memoranda of Understanding  \n\non Cooperation on Statistical Capacity to support further improvements in \n\ncountries\u2019 statistical capacity. \n\n\u2022   GPEDC monitoring framework (GPMF) implementation: MDBs have \n\ngiven guidance on the monitoring indicators to their country offices that \n\nprepared data at the request of partner country governments as a part \n\nof the monitoring survey. Some MDBs have included Paris Declaration/\n\nGPMF indicators in their corporate results frameworks (all available online). \n\nAfDB has included three GPMF indicators: annual predictability, aid on \n\nbudget, and use of public finance management systems and national \n\nprocurement procedures. Information on these indicators is collected \n\nannually through an internal aid effectiveness survey, with the support of \n\nAfDB country offices. The results will be published in the 2014 Annual \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness Review. AsDB has included two GPMF \n\nindicators: use of country results frameworks, and use of country public \n\nfinance management systems and national procurement procedures. It is \n\ncommitted to track its performance on these indicators annually as a part \n\nof its Development Effectiveness Review report. \n\nMDBs will continue to support the piloting of indicators at the global level \n\n(for example on civil society organisations engagement, private sector \n\nparticipation), the methodologies for which are being refined. MDBs country \n\noffices have also worked closely with partner country governments to \n\nsupport them in preparing data for the Global Partnership monitoring survey.\n\n\u2022   High Level Meeting (HLM) in Mexico: MDBs have been both supporting \n\npartner countries in their preparation for the HLM, and worked in \n\npartnership with the organisers to prepare some of the discussions taking \n\nplace in Mexico, for example on:  \n\n\u2713  Middle income countries and MDBs: effective development partners\n\u2713  Partnering with private investors for development impact\n\u2713  Fostering knowledge sharing capacity in country institutions\n\u2713  Using country systems and measuring their strength: what\u2019s next?\n\u2713  Multi-stakeholder approaches for enhancing multilateral organisations\u2019 \n\ncontribution to development results\n\nk\nn\na\nB\n\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\np\no\ne\nv\ne\nD\n\nl\n\n \nn\na\ns\nA\n\ni\n\n \ny\nb\n\n \ns\no\nt\no\nh\nP\n\n6\n\n\fThe future of the MDB partnership \ntowards and post-2015\n\n \nMDBs are committed to continue working as a group and in partnership \n\nwith client countries, including FCS and MICs, towards the implementation \n\nof the Busan principles and supporting the post-2015 agenda. MDBs will \n\ndo this while continuing to facilitate inclusive and effective development \n\npartnerships at the country level. Key areas of focus ahead for the MDB \n\npartnership include continued knowledge generation and dissemination, \n\nefficacy and effectiveness of business policies and procedures, use of \n\ncountry systems (including capacity for country diagnostics and reporting), \n\ntransparency, and more innovative financing modalities and services. The \nMDBs support a more robust financing framework for post-2015, based \n\non pillars of improved domestic resource mobilization, better and smarter \n\naid, private finance for development, and inclusive and innovative sources \n\nof finance. MDBs will continue to work together on these topics, report on \n\ntheir progress at the next High-Level Meeting and remain committed to the \n\nleadership role of partner countries in setting the development agenda.\n\nh\na\nu\nq\nc\nA\n\n \ni\nf\n\no\nK\n\n \na\nn\na\nN\n\n/\n\nD\nA\nF\n\u00a9\n\nI\n\n7\n\n\f\f", "author_pages": ["MDBs: Partnering for  \neffective development\n", " \nMDBs are at the core of development cooperation and \n", "effectiveness.
