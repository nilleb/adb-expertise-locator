This book \ncontrasts the urban development experiences and practices of the two giant countries \nin Asia: the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India. The Asian Development Bank \nsponsored a 9-day workshop on Urban Development Experience and Visions, and \nsenior-level government officials of India were invited for the workshop, and visited \nBeijing, Suzhou, and Shenzhen in the PRC. Based on the workshop, field visits, and \npolicy discussions on innovative urban development practices, this book summarizes \nkey messages derived from the workshop: the challenges of urbanization should be \nturned around and viewed as opportunities for achieving economic growth. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality \nof life of their people. Despite the region's many successes, it remains home to \ntwo thirds of the world's poor. Nearly 1.7 billion people in the region live on $2 or \nless a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n\n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. \nIts main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, \nloans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. In 2007, \nit approved $10.1 billion of loans, $673 million of grant projects, and technical \nassistance amounting to $243 million.\n\n \n\nU\nr\nb\na\nn\nD\ne\nv\ne\nl\no\np\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \n\n \n\nE\nx\np\ne\nr\ni\ne\nn\nc\ne\n \na\nn\nd\nV\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\ns\n:\n \nI\nn\nd\ni\na\n \na\nn\nd\n \nt\nh\ne\n \nP\ne\no\np\nl\ne\n\u2019\ns\n \nR\ne\np\nu\nb\nl\ni\nc\n \no\nf\n \n\nC\nh\ni\nn\na\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/urbandev\nISBN 978-971-561-744-4\nPublication Stock No. BBK175608\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\fUrban Development Series\n\nK.

The workshop was held in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), where high-level of\ufb01cials of \ncentral, state, and municipal governments from India were invited \nto share the vision and experience of the two countries. Particular \nemphasis  was  given  to  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  the  provi-\nsion of urban infrastructure and services. The mobile workshop for \nthe participants from India was conducted in the cities of Beijing, \nSuzhou, and Shenzhen.\n\ne\n\nThe  workshop  focused on drawing lessons and implications\nfrom the visions and experience of urban development in the PRC \nand  India.  In  considering  the  private  sector\u2019s  role,  however,  the \nworkshop  participants  went beyond the technical details of PSP.\nThey  considered  the  modality  in  the  broader  context  of  urban  \ndevelopment policies and strategies, including the formation of city\nregions, emergence of clustered cities, inclusive urban development,\nthe use of land in promoting PSP, and urban governance.\n\ninclusive \n\nWe hope that this report will generate interest among numer-\nous  stakeholders  and  provide  a  better  understanding  of  the  key \nchallenges.

From India, 21 high-level officials from the central, state, \nand  municipal  governments  participated  in  the  workshop,  and \nprovided  valuable  insights  and  recommendations  on  their  urban  \nvisions.  From  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  more  than  \n21  key  officials  representing  central,  provincial,  municipal,  and  \ndistrict governments; academic researchers; and managers of public\u2013\nprivate sector enterprises made presentations to share urban develop-\nment practices and knowledge of the PRC during the workshop. In \nparticular, we would like to thank greatly the Shenzhen and Suzhou \nmunicipalities for hosting and arranging field visits, since the field \nobservations of projects after the 1-day seminar in each municipal-\nity  significantly  enhanced  understanding  of  the  innovativeness  of \nurban  development  practices.  Further,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nChina  Center  for Town  Reform  and  Development  (CCTRD),  it \nwas possible that this workshop brought out the best learning pro-\ngram.  We  also  thank  the  following  peer  reviewers  and  assistance \nfrom Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff. Anand Chiplunka and \nSekhar Bonu carefully read the manuscripts and provided valuable \ncomments.

The site visits and dialogue among key officials elicited \na number of insights and policy recommendations, summarized as \nfollows:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nCity  Cluster  development  approach  promises  to  be  an  \neffective instrument in an urban-led development strategy. \nCity cluster development involves the planned provision of \nurban infrastructure and services in an area-wide develop-\nment. Studies may be conducted in India on the feasibility \nof using this approach. \nAn urban strategy that concentrates investments in a\nstrategy  that  concentrates  investments  in  a \nn  urban  strategy that concentrates investments in a\nfew  strategic  urban  centers  can  stimulate  rapid  economic \ngrowth. Such a strategy  should  emphasize  broader  urban \nregional development encompassing towns, cities, and vil-\nlages  that  form  an  urban  cluster.  Development  planning \nfor  such  an  urban  cluster  may cover whole city regions.\n  whole  city  regions. \nmay  cover whole city regions.\nKey  urban  infrastructure  and  services  require  area-wide \napproaches that consider urban and rural areas as a devel-\nopment unit and energize the economies of the entire city \nregion.  The  formulation  and  adoption  of  comprehensive \ndevelopment plans can be used as an initial step to show \nthe benefits of the region-wide coordinated approach. \nGovernance  mechanisms  for  urban  regions  can  take  the \nform  of  voluntary  federation  among  local  government \nbodies.  As  local  government  fragmentation  makes  urban \nregion  governance  difficult,  special  purpose  authorities \nor  unified  governance  systems  could  take  a  lead  role  in \nmanaging selected urban infrastructure and services. Such \ngovernance mechanisms can be established by central and \nstate  or  provincial  governments  or  the  political  will  of \nstrong local leaders.\n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_1   1\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:18 PM\n\n\f2  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nGovernment  officials  need  to  be  entrepreneurial  and \ntap  the  private  sector  in  designing,  financing,  as  well  as  \noperating  and  maintaining  urban  infrastructure  and  ser-\nvices. They can access central government grants, foreign \nand domestic loans, foreign direct investments, enterprise \nbonds,  bank  loans,  and  user  charges  for  financing  urban \nprojects.  Creating  an  enabling  environment  for  financial \nsustainability is a prerequisite to attract the private sector \nin the urban sector.\nGovernment authorities should offer substantial incentives \nto encourage foreign and domestic investment in the urban \nareas. Incentives can be in the form of the following: stable\nstable \n, fully serviced \nand municipal services, fully serviced\nof electricity and municipal services, fully serviced\n of electricity and municipal services, fully serviced\nsupply of electricity and municipal services, fully serviced\nland  ready  to  receive  factories  and  other  structures;  tax \nexemption  for  imported  production  inputs;  guaranteed \nrepatriation of profits; professional managers and healthy,\nhealthy,, \nliterate  workers;  and  personal  security.  Such  incentives \nare  particularly  important  to  attract  investors  in  special \neconomic  zones,  high-tech  zones,  and  other  productive \nenclaves.\nPSP can include the activities of small community groups \nand not just large public\u2013private enterprises. Such groups \ncan  bid  to  manage  urban  services  such  as  operation  and \nmaintenance of sanitation facilities, water or electricity dis-\ntribution in low income communities, composting of solid \nwaste, and collection of user charges. They can also assist in \nmonitoring the quality and adequacy of urban services by \nproviding immediate feedback to the authorities.\nThe  economic  value  of  state  land  can  be  unlocked  to  \nfinance urban infrastructure and services. Various schemes \ncan be used to leverage land as a financing tool such as land \nreadjustment, taxation to capture the increased land values \narising from infrastructure provision, efficient land assess-\nment and real estate tax collection, taxes on idle lands, land \nbanking, and reforms such as repeal of the urban land ceil-\ning act in India. \nA city\u2019s rich cultural heritage can be used as a productive \nresource in inner-city redevelopment. Inner city areas can \nbe  redeveloped  by  preserving  heritage  structures  like  old \nhouses, temples, classical gardens, and other structures. At \nthe same time, governments can provide modern facilities \nlike  water  supply,  sanitation,  electricity,  telephone  lines, \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_2   2\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:18 PM\n\n\fExecutive Summary  3\n\n\u2022\n\nstreet lighting, and paved streets and lanes without alter-\ning the cultural nature of the structures. The redeveloped \ncommunity structures can then be made available to private \nentrepreneurs  through  PSP  schemes  such  as  franchises, \nleases, and contracts for provision of services focusing on \ntourism, trade and commerce, and production of arts and \ncrafts. \nWhile full economic viability of urban infrastructure proj-\nects  is  a  worthy  objective,  their  large  size,  lumpy  capital \nneeds,  and  long  gestation  periods  may  require  initial  in-\nvestments  from  the  government.  Central,  provincial  or \nstate, and municipal governments, therefore, may have to \nprovide  subsidies,  especially  during  the  early  stages  of  a \nproject.  In  general,  the  policy  should  be  that  if  an  urban \nfacility benefits everyone and not just specific individuals, \nthey should be seen as public goods that can be subsidized. \nHowever, if they are private goods (they benefit only certain \nindividuals) their costs should be recovered from the pri-\nvate beneficiaries. In the case of infrastructure and services \nthat  incur  cash  flow  shortfalls  in  initial  years,  innovative \nfinancial  instruments  such  as  transition  support  funds  oror \nviability gap financing can be used. Such instruments take\ncan be used. Such instruments take \ninancing can be used. Such instruments take\nfinancing can be used. Such instruments take\nap financing can be used.

This  approach  is  markedly  different  from  the  strat-\negy of India that focuses more on developments within the formally  \ndelineated territories of individual cities. In the PRC, the distinction \nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas  has  been  effectively  blurred.  Urban \ndevelopment plans encompass city regions made up of the central city, \nsmall- and medium-sized cities on the metropolitan periphery, small \ntowns, villages, and open green spaces. Trunk infrastructure (roads and \ntransport systems, water, sewerage and sanitation, energy generation \nand distribution, information and communication, solid waste man-\nagement) are used to link together the cities within the cluster. These \ndevelopment  plans  have  also  helped  the  absorption  of  rural\u2013urban \nmigrants, the so-called floating population that used to be barred from \nsettling in cities by the hukou system.

This  new  strategy  fosters  the  development  of  \nurban regions composed of a number of urban and rural settlements \nof varying sizes. Such comprehensive plans also cover villages, small \ntowns, green field sites, and open spaces. \n\nA good example of the CCD planning approach is the strategic \nplan for Chongqing that seeks to \u201cdrive economic growth through \nurbanization.\u201d The plan conforms to the \u201cone hour economic circle\u201d \nconcept, with the planning area defined by the space covered in an \nhour by a traveler in a car that starts from the city center. The circle \nincludes  the  central  city  and  23  adjacent  districts.  It  encompasses \n28,700 square kilometers (km2) and a population of 22 million that \nwould make the city region the largest in the PRC.

The districts in \nthe northeastern part of the region would be developed as parts of \nan ecological zone devoted to urban agriculture. The southeastern \ndistricts  within  the  Wuling  Mountain  area  would  be  devoted  to \necological tourism. Within these ecological zones, more than 50% \nof the land would be covered by forests (Zhao 2007).\n\nAnother example of the CCD approach is special economic zones \nthat are not confined to the city\u2019s formal boundaries but encompass a \nmuch wider region. In August 1980, the National People\u2019s Congress \npassed Regulations for the Special Economic Zone of Guangdong \nProvince  and  officially  designated  a  portion  of  Shenzhen  as  the \nShenzhen Special Economic Zone (SSEZ). In 1984, the PRC fur-\nther opened 14 coastal cities to overseas investment: Beijhai, Dalian, \nFuzhou,  Guangzhou,  Lianyungang,  Nantong,  Ningbo,  Qingdao, \nQinhuangdao, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wenzhou, Yantai, and Zhanjiang. \nSimilarly, the comprehensive plan for the city of Shenzhen effectively \nlinks the PRC\u2019s most rapidly growing city with the Hong Kong and \nMacau special administrative regions, the special economic zone of \nZhuhai, the city of Guangzhou, and small- and intermediate-sized \ncities  like  Bao\u2019an,  Dongguan,  Longgang,  and  Zhongshan,  in  the \nPearl River delta. Such area-wide city cluster development schemes \navoid the spatial and political fragmentation that inhibits cooperative \nand  coordinated  action  among  local  government  bodies. They  also \neffectively deliver development benefits to rural hinterlands.\n\nUrbanization strategy has indeed enabled the PRC to achieve\nenabled the PRC to achieve \nindeed enabled the PRC to achieve\nhas indeed enabled the PRC to achieve\ndouble-digit rates of economic growth over the past 30 years.

First, \nthe rapid growth of the highly urbanized coastal provinces of Fujian, \nGuangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, has left interior provinces like \nAnhui, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous \nRegion  far  behind.  Second,  despite  the  PRC\u2019s  egalitarian  socialist \nideals, the gap between the rural poor and the urban rich has been \nrapidly widening. Third, while the hukou system has been abolished \nin Shenzhen, it is still enforced in other cities where it has failed to \ncontrol rural\u2013urban migration. About 20% of residents in large cities \nat present are temporary migrants denied access to welfare and social \nbenefits. Fourth, rapid urbanization has eaten up vast tracts of rich \nagricultural land in general, especially in the Pearl River and Yangtze \nRiver deltas, endangering the PRC\u2019s food self-sufficiency. Fifth and \nfinally, the PRC\u2019s urban-led development strategy has caused mas-\nsive  environmental  pollution.

PSP modalities, therefore, can be viewed as a continuum de-\npending  on  where  authority  and  responsibility  are  vested.  At  one \nend of the band is simple contracting, where the government con-\ntracts out a specific service to private enterprise. At the other end are \nprivatization concessions where private firms are authorized to de-\nsign, finance, build, operate, own, and manage a project. In between \nthese two approaches are design, build or operate contracts, build-\noperate-manage contracts, build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts, \nbuild-own-operate contracts, and buy-build-operate contracts. The \nreputed  advantage  of  using  PSP  is  the  ability  of  private  entrepre-\nneurs to operate under open competitive market conditions that en-\nable them to be more efficient in delivering public services. PSP can \nalso tap financial resources like private savings, foreign loans, foreign \ndirect investments, and others not usually available to governments. \nThere  are  some  drawbacks  to  PSP  operations,  of  course,  such  as \nhigher costs to consumers because of the need of entrepreneurs to \nbe compensated for the risks taken.

In India, private and public are clearly stipulated in laws, \ntraditions,  social  norms,  and  practices.  Land,  for  example,  can  be \nowned privately in fee simple2 and all benefits accruing to the land \ngo to the owner. If the state is to acquire land for public purposes, \nit has to purchase it at fair market value or resort to the exercise of \n\u201ceminent  domain\u201d  that  may  require  some  litigation.  In  the  PRC, \nafter  the  success  of  the  Communist  revolution  in  1949,  the  state \nconfiscated private land and other properties. According to the con-\nstitution of the PRC, all urban lands belong to the state while rural \nlands are collectively owned. Private individuals and corporate bod-\nies are not allowed to own land. They can only have limited rights \nto \u201cthe use of the land\u201d and to reap the benefits from that use within \nthe period specified in a lease agreement. \n\nBecause of the unique nature of ownership in the PRC, the use \nof PSP in the country needs further clarification. For example, some \nso-called \u201cprivate sector enterprises\u201d that act as developers, contrac-\ntors, and builders of urban infrastructure and services in the PRC \nwere  originally  established  by  communes  or  collectives  under  the \n\u201cproduction  responsibility  system.\u201d  When  economic  reforms  were \nlaunched  in  1978,  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  collectives \nwere  made  responsible  for  the  productivity  and  welfare  of  their \nworkers  and  members.  With  the  abolition  of  communes,  farmers \nwere  allowed  to  produce  crops  on  lands  allotted  to  them  and  to \nsell their products in open markets. Collectives were encouraged to \nset up profit-making township and village enterprises that initially \nsparked  the  PRC\u2019s  rapid  rate  of  economic  development.  In  urban \nareas,  community  and  district  committees  set  up  enterprises  such \nas hotels, grocery stores, construction companies, and housing proj-\nects. Although these enterprises were initially capitalized from the \n\u201cpublic\u201d funds of the collectives, they eventually became \u201cprivate\u201d in \nthe sense that they developed their own institutional identity. From \nthese early beginnings, the \u201cprivate sector\u201d has become a major fac-\ntor in the economic growth of the PRC. The use of PSP became so \nwidespread that in 2005, the National People\u2019s Congress approved \nOpinions to Promoting and Guiding Private Sector Development \nthat clarified how PSP could be used for development projects. PSP \nhas become so widespread that, at present, more than 40% of total \nGDP, 60% of economic growth, and 75% of new employment in the \nPRC is contributed by the private sector. \n\n2  An estate in land without limitation to any class of heirs or restrictions on transfer \n\nof ownership.\n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_16   16\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:21 PM\n\n\fHighlight\ufffd of \nthe Work\ufffdhop \nProgram\n\nThe  highlights  of  the  PRC\u2013ADB\u2013India  work-\nshop can be divided into concepts discussed and \nlessons  learned  during  the  visits  to  Suzhou  and \nShenzhen and the internal discussions on the last \nday of the workshop in Shenzhen.

The main source of investments was the private sector, \nincluding companies such as Hong Kong and China Gas Co., Ltd. \nthat partnered with a Suzhou-based municipal utility group to set up \nSIP Towngas Co., Ltd.; and the Qingyuan, Hong Kong, and China \nWater  Co.,  Ltd.  that  jointly  established  the  SIP  Qingyuan  Hong \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_20   20\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:32 PM\n\n\fHighlights of the Workshop Program  21\n\nKong and China Water Co., Ltd. with a total production capacity \nof 450,000 tons of potable water per day. PSP joint ventures also set \nup a wastewater treatment plant capable of handling 200,000 tons  \nof wastewater per day. In effect, SIP was planned and developed as a \nnew city that now has a population of more than 500,000, including \n8,000 foreign residents. During the past 10 years, more than 120,000 \njobs have been created by enterprises within the park, and the aver-\nage  income  of  urban  residents  has  reached  CNY30,000  ($4,132) \nper  year,  compared  to  CNY12,000  ($1,653)  for  rural  residents  in \nadjacent areas. \n\nMaNa\ufffdEMENt of INfra\ufffd\ufffdtrUCtUrE  \nProjECt\ufffd\ufffd\n\nTo manage its myriad development projects, Suzhou set up a compa-\nny named Suzhou City Construction, Investment and Development \nCo., Ltd. (SCCIDC) in August 2001. The main task of the com-\npany  is  to  manage  the  planning,  financing,  and  construction  of \nurban  utilities  as  well  as  to  look  after  the  city\u2019s  industrial  invest-\nments and assets. Under the agency are five subsidiaries: the Suzhou \nGas  Group,  Suzhou  Port  Development  Group,  Suzhou  Sports \nInvestment  Development  Company,  Suzhou  Convention  Center, \nand the Suzhou Water Affairs Development Company. Aside from \nthese subsidiaries, the agency also has seven holding subsidiaries and \n11 shareholding companies under it. In September 2007, the whole \ncompany  had  total  capital  assets  amounting  to  CNY24.5  billion \n($3.37 billion). \n\nAs Suzhou\u2019s main construction agency, SCCIDC is responsible \nfor  the  planning,  design,  and  construction  of  projects,  including \nassessment of their economic and financial viability, determination \nof  environmental  and  social  impacts,  investment  of  capital,  and  \nallocation  of  land  resources.  Financing  schemes  are  evaluated  by \nthe Suzhou Municipal Finance Bureau and the Finance Evaluation \nCenter. Actual construction and project management is carried out \nby  the  Suzhou  Municipal  Construction  Bureau  and  the  Suzhou \nMunicipal  Public  Utilities  Bureau.  Monitoring  of  project  imple-\nmentation and audit of financial transactions are carried out by the \nSuzhou Municipal Audit Bureau. \n\nSomewhat parallel to the Suzhou approach, a similar develop-\nment company has been created by the government of Maharashtra \nin  India  to  manage  the  Navi  Mumbai  (New  Bombay)  SEZ. The \nCity  and  Industrial  Development  Corporation  (CIDCO)  was  \nestablished  in  2001  as  the  nodal  agency  for  the  development  of \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_21   21\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:33 PM\n\n\f22  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nthe SEZ. CIDCO already owns the land for the SEZ. To facilitate \ndevelopment, it transferred all existing infrastructure and land de-\nvelopment rights to a special purpose vehicle that has entered into \njoint ventures with foreign and domestic partners for developing and \nmarketing the SEZ to potential tenants. CIDCO has also offered \nmanagement control and a majority equity stake (from 51% to 74%) \nin the special purpose vehicle to strategic partners. \n\nIn Suzhou, in addition to creating SCCIDC, the municipality \nhas  set  up  the  Suzhou  Public  Utility  Bureau  (SPUB)  that  runs  a \nOne-Stop Service Hall designed to immediately react to messages \nfrom city residents. The service hall was opened in April 2005 and \nprovides a hotline system whereby citizens can directly communicate \nwith the municipal government system using a paperless electronic \nmulti-channel system. By dialing 12345 on their telephones, citizens \ncan directly reach the service hall to ask questions, air complaints, \nrequest emergency repairs, or share their ideas on public issues. The \nservice hall has 34 active channels and 60 telephone lines that are \nopen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service hall guarantees a \npositive  response  within  24  hours  to  reports  requiring  emergency \nrepairs  while  other  services  are  resolved  within  3  to  7  days.  Since \n2005, the service hall has responded to more than 1.3 million cases \nand reports a problem-solved rate of 99% as well as a public service \nsatisfaction rate of 96%.\n\nThe operations of SPUB are remarkably similar to those of the \nLudhiana Municipal Corporation (LMC) in India. Like SPUB, the \nLMC was designed to ensure speedy response to citizen complaints. \nIn the case of Ludhiana, the city was divided into four zones, with each \nzone headed by a zonal commissioner. All complaints are handled at \nthe zone level. More importantly, all taxes are now paid at the zone \nlevel  as  well. Within  each  zone,  a  single  window  system  has  been \nset up for functions such as paying of taxes, water bills, and license \nfees. The pinpointing of responsibility has made the services more \nefficient and it has maximized transparency and accountability. \n\nAn important PSP innovation in Suzhou is the direct participa-\ntion of community groups in running the city\u2019s sanitation system. \nBecause  the  inner  city  areas  of  Suzhou  have  very  high  residential \ndensities,  many  of  the  old  homes  do  not  have  individual  toilets. \nThus, the SPUB has constructed 245 public toilets with an invest-\nment  of  CNY63  million  ($8.7  million).  The  operation,  cleaning, \nand  maintenance  of  each  public  toilet  is  contracted  out  to  private \ngroups in a process that relies on secret public bidding. The Suzhou \nEnvironmental Sanitation Administration Agency has 18 environ-\n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_22   22\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:33 PM\n\n\fHighlights of the Workshop Program  23\n\nmental  sanitation  coordinators  who  regularly  inspect  the  toilets \nto make sure that they are cleaned and maintained properly. Citi- \nzens may also contact the hotline of the service hall to report any \nproblems.\n\nAnother project in Suzhou carried out under a PSP approach \nwas  the  solid  waste  incineration  and  power  generation  plant. The \nplant was constructed in 2004 under a BOT scheme with the China \nEverbright International Ltd. of Hong Kong. The city government \nprovided  88  mu  of  land  for  the  project  that  covers  a  total  area  of  \n126.6  mu.  Total  investment  in  the  project  was  CNY520  mil-\nlion ($71.6 million). During the first 6 months of 2007, the plant  \nincinerated about 1,200 tons of solid waste per day and generated \nelectricity of about 310,000 kilowatt-hour (kWh) per day. Because \nof the success of the project, there are plans to expand its capacity to \nhandle as much as 800 tons of solid waste per day. \n\nAn important management innovation of Suzhou Municipality \nthat facilitates PSP was the streamlining of its project appraisal and \nreview  process  to  cut  down  processing  time.  For  example,  in  the \ncase of the Changshu city water project within Suzhou municipal-\nity,  the  processing  time  from  project  initiation  to  actual  contract  \napproval took 325 days. The project was started in 2006 as a partial \nequity transfer venture with investments coming from Hong Kong, \nMacau, and Taipei,China for the Changshu Municipal Public Asset \nManagement  Co.,  Ltd.  The  various  steps  in  the  process  were  as  \nfollows:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFirst  phase  project  preparation  (130  days),  including \ndrawing  up  of  project  construction  and  financing  plans \nand  approval  by  the  Municipal  People\u2019s  Government  of \nChangshu city;\nProject  announcement  (45  days).  Five  competitive  bids \nwere submitted after the announcement.\nDue diligence studies (10 days). Bidders were provided by \nChangshu  municipality  with  detailed  information  about \nthe project.\nEvaluation  of  submitted  investment  proposals  (40  days). \nThree  expert  groups  representing  management,  finance, \nand legal departments reviewed the five bids.\nProject  negotiation  and  preparation  of  draft  agreement \n(20  days).  Changshu  city  authorities  negotiated  with  the  \nwinning  bidder,  Sino-French  Holdings  (Hong  Kong), \nLtd.\n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_23   23\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:33 PM\n\n\f24  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nProject approval (60 days). The equity merger was signed \nand  the  project  was  granted  a  certificate  of  approval  for \nestablishing the enterprise.\nPreparations for start-up operations (20 days). The board \nof directors of the enterprise met to approve the franchis-\ning  agreement  covering  a  30-year  period.  The  investors \nguaranteed  the  transfer  of  CNY180  million  ($24.8  mil- \nlion) to the Changshu city authorities to start design, con-\nstruction, and operation of the project.\n\nfINaNCIN\ufffd UrbaN INfra\ufffd\ufffdtrUCtUrE  \nProjECt\ufffd\ufffd \n\nTo finance its infrastructure projects and services, SCCIDC relies \non  capital  allocations  from  Suzhou  municipality  and  loans  from \nthe  China  Development  Bank  and  various  commercial  banks.  By \nSeptember 2007, the Suzhou Municipal Finance Bureau had allo-\ncated about CNY5 billion ($689 million) to the company for vari-\nous projects. In addition, the city government extended loans to the \nvarious subsidiaries of around CNY4 billion ($551 million). Stocks \nwere  issued  to  finance  the  construction  of  the  Ring  Expressway \nand to support projects of the Suzhou Gas Group. The construc-\ntion of the Baodai West Road Bridge and the Tantai Lake Bridge \nwere carried out under a BOT scheme. China Development Bank \nhas financed the construction of the Suzhou train station, the main \nexpressway  linking  Suzhou  to  Shanghai,  and  other  road  projects. \nCommercial bank loans amounting to CNY5.5 billion ($758 mil- \nlion) have also been tapped to finance various projects. In addition, \nSuzhou  Municipality  has  allocated  land  of  around  1,150  mu  to \nSuzhou Industry Co., Ltd. to augment the company\u2019s assets.\n\nTo attract foreign and domestic investment, Suzhou municipal-\nity offers a number of incentives. For example, investors in the SIP \nare allowed to lease land where they can build their own factories. \nSome may also rent ready-built factory buildings conforming to their \nown  specifications.  These  include  terrace  factories,  fully  serviced \nworkshops,  free-standing  structures,  or  multistory  buildings.  SIP \nassures private investors of adequate and reliable sources of energy, \npotable water, efficient sewerage, solid waste collection and disposal, \ngood  telecommunication  facilities,  efficient  management,  and  a \nhighly trained and disciplined work force. Aside from these services, \ninvestors are provided with tax exemptions and privileges. The usual \nrate  for  corporate  income  tax  is  15%,  but  this  can  be  reduced  or \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_24   24\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:33 PM\n\n\fHighlights of the Workshop Program  25\n\nwaived under certain conditions. For example, if an investor operates \nan  enterprise  in  excess  of  10  years,  his  local  income  tax  is  further \nreduced  by  3%.  Private  firms  that  invest  in  urban  infrastructure \nare given special incentives. If the operation of a company exceeds  \n15 years, the income tax rate is reduced to 7.5% for the next 5 years.\n\nThe success of SIP can be attributed to the fact that as a joint \nventure between the governments of PRC and Singapore, the park \nmanagement  has  been  vested  with  a  great  deal  of  authority  and \npower. For example, SIP can approve foreign-funded projects within \n3 days, provided they are in line with national policy. The Foreign \nAffairs  Office  of  SIP  is  empowered  by  the  PRC\u2019s  State  Council \nand  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  to  immediately  approve  offi-\ncial visits, issue visa notification letters and official duty passports, \nand  apply  for  visas  from  foreign  embassies  in  the  PRC. The  SIP \nis  equipped  with  a  complete  and  modern  logistics  system.  It  has \nan  independent  customs  office  and  a  bonded  logistics  center  with \nthe  most  advanced  information  technology  network  in  the  PRC. \nThe SIP export processing zone has been authorized by the State \nCouncil to independently carry out customs clearance and cut the \ntime for cargo delivery. The workers in SIP also enjoy one of the best \nsocial security systems in the PRC, one patterned after Singapore\u2019s \nCentral  Provident  Fund  that  covers  housing,  medical  benefits,  re-\ntirement benefits, and social assistance. As such, SIP can effectively \ncompete  against  other  enterprises  in  hiring  the  best  professionals \nand  technical  people.  Consequently,  SIP\u2019s  management,  staff,  and \nworkers all enjoy high morale. \n\n\ufffd\ufffdHENzHEN MUNICIPalIty vI\ufffd\ufffdIt\n\nShenzhen  was  established  as  the  PRC\u2019s  first  SEZ  in  1980 \nand  in  the  past  27  years,  it  has  grown  from  a  small  fish-\ning  village  with  30,000  inhabitants  to  a  megacity  of  more  than  \n10 million (see Figure 5). In 1988, Shenzhen\u2019s status was raised to \na provincial level city in Guangdong, and its territory was expanded \nto 1,800 km2. In 1992, the PRC\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress gave \nShenzhen full authority to pass its own laws and set up zoning codes \nand  regulations.  In  the  following  year,  the  city\u2019s  territory  was  ex-\npanded  to  2,020  km2.  In  2004,  Shenzhen  became  the  first  city  in \nthe PRC to become entirely urban with the abolition of the rural \nhousehold registration (hukou) for all city residents, including tem-\nporary migrant laborers who became entitled to full city benefits and \nwelfare services.\n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_25   25\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:33 PM\n\n\f26  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n \n\nfigure 5.  \ufffd\ufffdhenzhen in 1978 and 2007\n\n \n\nFigure 5.

SEZs \nin India are designed to provide an internationally competitive en-\nvironment for production of export items. Each zone is designated \na duty-free enclave, essentially a foreign territory for the purpose of \ntrade operations and matters of duties and tariffs. As in the PRC, \nseveral  incentives  are  offered  to  foreign  investors  to  locate  in  the \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_26   26\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:41 PM\n\n\fHighlights of the Workshop Program  27\n\nzones.  SEZ  authorities  offer  fully  serviced  land  plots,  world  class \ninfrastructure, a variety of factories, recreational facilities, and highly \ntrained managers and workers. In the Navi Mumbai SEZ, for ex-\nample, the Maharashtra state government has set aside 4,337 hec- \ntares  of  land  to  be  developed  at  a  cost  of  $520  million.  As  in \nShenzhen and Suzhou, the proximity of the Navi Mumbai SEZ to a \nhigh-growth area (Mumbai with a population of almost 20 million) \nis seen as a definite advantage. Aside from the Navi Mumbai SEZ, \n12 other SEZs all over India have been approved in principle and \nfeasibility studies or detailed project reports are being prepared for \neach one. Three of the SEZs are in Uttar Pradesh (Bhadohi, Greater \nNoida, and Kanpur); two in West Bengal (Kulpi and Salt Lake); two \nin Orissa (Gopalpur and Pradeep); and one each in Andra Pradesh \n(Kakinand), Gujarat (Positra), Karnataka (Hassan), Madhya Pradesh \n(Indore), and Tami Nadu (Nanguneri). \n\nAs  the  PRC\u2019s  first  major  experiment  in  urban-led  economic \ndevelopment,  Shenzhen  has  played  a  major  historic  role  in  the \ncountry\u2019s progress. On 1 December 1987, the first public auction \nthat gave a private investor the \u201cright to use\u201d public land through \na long-term lease was held in Shenzhen. In 1988, the first transfer \nof  a  public  housing  unit  to  a  private  household  also  occurred  in \nthe  city. The  PRC\u2019s  first  stock  exchange  opened  in  Shenzhen  in \n1990.  In  1992,  Deng  Xiaoping  signaled  the  continuation  of  the \nPRC\u2019s policy of economic reform and opening-up to the outside \nworld during his pivotal \u201csouthern tour.\u201d In Shenzhen, Deng repu-\ndiated the criticisms of his economic policies that arose after the  \n1989  Tiananmen  incident  and  announced  that  \u201cthe  important \nlesson  of  Shenzhen  is  to  dare  to  charge  into  forbidden  zones\u201d  \n(Hessler 2006).\n\nBy the end of 2006, investment in Shenzhen from 102 countries \nand regions had amounted to $53.9 billion supporting some 32,783 \nprograms  and  projects.  Some  $21.8  billion  of  these  investments \ncame from Hong Kong, China. The investments have taken many \nforms  including  wholly-owned  foreign  enterprises,  joint  ventures, \ncooperative  enterprises,  joint  stock  companies,  franchises,  and \nother business arrangements. They have covered all fields including \nconstruction,  manufacturing,  real  estate,  energy  generation,  tele-\ncommunications,  and  infrastructure  facilities.  Through  the  years, \nthere has been a shift in the nature of foreign-funded investments \nin Shenzhen from \u201cassembling and processing firms\u201d to more high-\ntech  industries.  At  present,  among  the  investors  in  Shenzhen  are \n101  Fortune  500  enterprises  and  341  industrial  firms  focusing  on \nhigh-tech industries.\n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_27   27\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:41 PM\n\n\f28  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nThe location of Shenzhen only 20 km from Hong Kong, China \nhas  been  an  important  factor  in  its  development.  Hong  Kong, \nChina\u2019s  PSP  investments  in  Shenzhen  have  gone  through  at  least \nthree  stages.  Between  1980  and  1987,  many  Hong  Kong,  China \nenterprises  were  mainly  engaged  in  subcontractual  arrangements \nwith Shenzhen producers. They provided capital, product designs, \nproduction  technologies,  marketing  know-how,  and  managerial \nservices, while Shenzhen firms provided land, factories, labor, and \nlogistics. Between 1988 and 1992, most Hong Kong, China firms \ntransferred  their  factories  and  plants  to  Shenzhen  and  adjacent \ncommunities  where  land  was  available,  labor  was  cheap,  and  local \nofficials and entrepreneurs were eager to enter into joint ventures. \nFrom 1993 to the present, almost all direct manufacturing processes \nhave  been  transferred  from  Hong  Kong,  China  to  Shenzhen  and \nits environs. Research and development, venture capital aggregation, \nfinancial strategies, international marketing, and other \u201cintelligence\u201d \nfunctions are still concentrated in Hong Kong, China. However, as \nShenzhen has rapidly progressed, many of these functions are being \ntaken up by Shenzhen enterprises as well. \n\nINvE\ufffd\ufffdtIN\ufffd IN UrbaN INfra\ufffd\ufffdtrUCtUrE \ntHroU\ufffdH P\ufffd\ufffdP\n\nThe  development  strategy  for  Shenzhen  envisioned  a  middle- \nincome,  well-off  society  by  the  year  2030.  To  achieve  this  goal, \nthe  Shenzhen  municipal  government  identified  the  provision  of \nurban  infrastructure  as  the  main  instrument  for  speeding  up  the \ncity region\u2019s growth. The SEZ was built from scratch as the PRC \nauthorities constructed an extensive network of roads; built a rail-\nbased public transit system; opened up four major ports in Chiwan, \nMawan, Shekou, and Yantian; established a region-wide water and \nsewerage system; built the first nuclear-powered energy generating \nplant in the PRC; set up a \u201csmart\u201d information and communication \nsystem using fiber optics; provided exciting tourist sites and facili-\nties; and constructed thousands of apartments for the rapidly grow-\ning population. Most of the infrastructure projects required massive \namounts of public and private capital. They took a long time to build \nand were slow to generate income. Thus, the central Government, \nthe province of Guangdong, Shenzhen municipality, and other lo-\ncal bodies in the region availed of preferential policies extended by \nthe PRC government such as tax exemptions, monetization of land \nvalues, and long-term concession loans. \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_28   28\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:41 PM\n\n\fHighlights of the Workshop Program  29\n\nAn excellent example of PSP for urban infrastructure was the \nestablishment of container ports in four coastal areas of Shenzhen. \nTo  finance  port  development,  the  PRC  utilized  four  modalities. \nFirst,  loans  were  raised  from  foreign  governments.  The  con-\nstruction  of  Yantian  port,  for  example,  was  financed  by  a  loan  of  \n\u00a512.3  billion  ($116  million)  from  Japan.  Second,  the  PRC  \napproached foreign private firms to enter into joint venture arrange-\nments with Shenzhen enterprises. Yantian port, the largest container \nport terminal in Shenzhen, was started in 1993 with the signing of \na contract between the PRC and Hutchison Port Holdings, a pri-\nvate Hong Kong company, for the creation of Yantian International \nContainer  Terminals,  Ltd.  (YICT).  The  joint  venture  required  \ninvestment  of  HK$2.4  billion  ($307  million),  73%  of  which  was \nprovided  by  Hutchison.  By  September  2004,  four  terminal  berths \nhad  been  constructed  in  Yantian  by  the  Hutchison-Yantian  Port \nGroup, and the last berth alone increased the capacity of the port \nby an additional 2.4 million tons of cargo. A similar PSP arrange-\nment  was  used  for  the  construction  of  the  Dachanwan  Port  Area \nContainer Wharf  that  was  a  joint  venture  between  the  Shenzhen \nPort Group and Modern Terminals of Wharf (Holdings), Ltd. The \n20-year contract for Dachanwan required investment of CNY20 bil- \nlion  ($2.7  billion),  with  about  65%  of  the  amount  coming  from \nforeign investors, 90% of which came from Hong Kong. \n\nThird,  Shenzhen  municipality  raised  capital  by  issuing  shares \nof  stocks  for  its  port  operations  (Figure  6). To  manage  its  public \nofferings, Shenzhen Port Group established three listing companies \nand these raised CNY1.13 billion ($155.6 million) in just their first \nlisting. Finally, Shenzhen Port Group accumulates funds from the \noperations  and  profits  of  its  terminals.  At  present,  Shenzhen  has \nfour ports with 131 productive berths with a total length of 24.6 km.  \nThe ports have an annual capacity of 140 million tons. The 29 con-\ntainer  berths  alone  can  handle  containers  of  12.7  million  twenty-\nfoot equivalent units (TEUs) per year. \n\nInvestors in Shenzhen and other cities in the PRC have tapped \nthe enterprise bond market to raise capital for infrastructure projects \nand services. While the bond market is still at an early stage in the \nPRC, bonds issued reached CNY101.5 billion ($13.9 billion) as of \n2006,  seven  times  larger  than  the  CNY14.4  billion  ($1.9  billion) \nissued  in  2004.  During  the  first  10  months  of  2007,  enterprise \nbonds  amounted  to  CNY72.8  billion  ($10  billion).  Among  the \nenterprises authorized to float bonds by the National Development \nReform Commission (NDRC) in 2007, 13 belonged to the central \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_29   29\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:41 PM\n\n\f30  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nGovernment and 84 were local enterprises. The bulk of the funds \nraised through bonds were allocated to infrastructure projects.\n\nThe  2007  Shenzhen  Expressway  Bond  issue  provides  a  good  \nexample of how enterprise bonds are used for financing urban infra-\nstructure. The total bond issue was for CNY 800 million ($110.2 mil- \nlion) redeemable within a period of 15 years at a nominal interest \nrate of 5.5%. The bond was issued by the Shenzhen Expressway Co., \nLtd., and approved by NDRC through the Shenzhen Development \nand Reform Bureau. It was rated Grade AAA by the Zhongchengxin \n\nfigure 6.  \ufffd\ufffdhenzhen Port\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure6. Shenzhen Port (Source: Shenzhen Municipality) \n\nFigure6.

The  funds  from  the  bond  issue  were  used  for \nthe  renovation  of  the  Qinglian\u2013Yuanzhou  expressway  valued  at \nCNY5.06  billion  ($697  million),  which  met  the  Government\u2019s \nrequirement  that  bond  financing  should  not  exceed  20%  of  the \ntotal investment in a project. An important factor in the quick ap-\nproval  of  the  bond  issue  was  the  fact  that  Shenzhen  Expressway \nCo.,  Ltd.,  was  the  largest  company  involved  in  the  construction \nand operation of toll highways and urban roads in the whole Pearl \nRiver  delta.  In  March  1997,  the  company  issued  747.5  million  \nH-shares3 on the Hong Kong Exchange and 165 million A-shares \nin  Shanghai,  raising  its  share  holding  equity  to  CNY2.18  billion \n($300 million). By June 2007, the company\u2019s total assets amounted \nto CNY13.35 billion ($1.8 billion), and its net profits (non-audited) \nreached  CNY444 million  ($61.1  million)  during  the  first  half  of  \nthe year.\n\nMaNa\ufffdIN\ufffd UrbaN INfra\ufffd\ufffdtrUCtUrE  \nProjECt\ufffd\ufffd\n\nDuring  the  early  years  in  Shenzhen\u2019s  development,  urban  infra-\nstructure and services were managed by wholly government-owned  \nenterprises.

The  company  has  assets  of  CNY7.1  billion  ($978  mil- \nlion) and annual sales of CNY1.6 billion ($220.4 million). Moreover, \nthe shareholders of the Shenzhen Water Group have decided to turn \nthe  joint  venture  into  a  flagship  enterprise  that  undertakes  water \nprojects in other parts of the PRC. Within a year of this decision, \nthe  company  had  acquired  and  signed  letters  of  intent  to  set  up \neight water projects in various parts of the country. In April 2005, \nShenzhen Water Investment Co., Ltd. was formed as an investment \nplatform  for  expanding  operations  outside  the  PRC.  The  invest-\nment  company  has  set  the  target  of  taking  over  at  least  3%  of  all \nurban water projects in the PRC.\n\nThe supply of gas to Shenzhen and the districts of Bao\u2019an and \nLonggang also used to be provided by a state-owned enterprise. In \n2002, Shenzhen Gas Corporation was awarded a 30-year franchise \nto supply gas to the city region (see Figure 8). When the joint ven-\nture was successfully established, about 40% of the company\u2019s capital \nwas  provided  by  foreign  firms,  including  Hong  Kong  and  China \nGas Investment, Co., Ltd. The total investment in Shenzhen Gas \nwas  CNY905  million  ($124.6  million),  and  this  was  projected  to \nincrease  to  CNY1.4  billion  ($192.8  million)  within  50  years. The \ncontract for service specified that Shenzhen municipal government \nwould have supervision of the franchised operation. The price of gas \nto consumers would also be determined by the municipal govern-\nment after negotiations with the joint venture company.\n\nfigure 8.  \ufffd\ufffdhenzhen \ufffdas Corporation\n\n \n\nSource: China Center for Town Reform and Development.\n\nFigure 8.

An inclusive approach to de-\nvelopment that views urbanization as an energizing element in eco-\nnomic  growth  includes  rural  areas  on  the  periphery  of  cities. The \nemergence of clustered-cities development also includes rural areas \nin  comprehensive  plans.  Inclusive  development  is  benefiting  mil-\nlions of rural\u2013urban migrants pushed by poverty from the country-\nside and pulled by the attractions of city life. Since the great majority \nof migrants end up in poorly serviced slums and squatter commu-\nnities, an  inclusive  development strategy seeks to extend the ben-\nefits of development to these peripheral and hinterland areas. It also  \nincludes benefits to specific groups such as women, youth, the elderly, \nand the socially and economically disadvantaged. Finally, inclusive \ndevelopment focuses not only on the economic and social benefits \narising from urbanization. It also focuses on externalities and what \nto do with such issues as environmental pollution, extinction of spe-\ncies, and global warming. \n\nThe  management  of  rural\u2013urban  migrant  flows  has  been  one \nof the main concerns in inclusive development in the PRC. Until \n1979, urban residents in the country made up less than 20% of the \ntotal population. This level has sharply risen since the launching of \neconomic  reforms,  mainly  by  relaxation  of  the  hukou  system  that \nallowed  surplus  labor  from  the  rural  areas  to  benefit  from  labor \nshortages in urban areas. By 2004, about 118 million rural residents \nhad flocked to cities, about 70% of whom went to the coastal areas. \nInitially, urban immigration was seasonal and cyclical, with people \ngoing to cities during the slack agricultural production season and \nthen returning for farm work. In recent years, however, migration \nhas become more permanent with migrants now becoming an im-\npoverished underclass in a number of coastal cities. \n\nThe PRC\u2019s urban-led development strategy opened up job op-\nportunities  for  many  rural\u2013urban  migrants  in  the  informal  sector, \nconstruction, services, food processing, and manufacturing; however, \nthe  sheer  volume  of  migrants  became  a  big  burden.  Housing  for \nthe migrants became a major social problem. In cities like Beijing, \nGuangzhou,  and  Shanghai  some  of  the  migrants  initially  found \naccommodation in rural areas in the urban periphery where farm-\ners rented out bed spaces to them. Some shanty towns formed on \nthe  outskirts  of  Shenzhen  and  became  problem  areas  for  crime, \ngambling, prostitution, drugs, and other vices. To accommodate mi-\ngrants, most city authorities opened up employment agencies that \nfound jobs for a fee (in Shenzhen, usually about CNY10 or $1.4). \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_36   36\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM\n\n\fPolicy Implications of Workshop Discussions  37\n\nFactories  conducted  training  programs  for  repetitive  work  on  as-\nsembly lines. They provided accommodation in barracks-type houses \nand provided food, uniforms, medical services, and other benefits to \nworkers. Most rural migrant workers were able to earn more in the \ncities than what they would get from rural agricultural life.\n\nIn India, one of the main missions of the JNNURM is poverty \nreduction for the urban poor in its 63 targeted cities. Better condi-\ntions  for  the  urban  poor  require  massive  investments.  About  58% \nof urban residents do not have potable water within their premises \nand sewerage and low-cost sanitation are available to only 35% of \nresidents  in  class  IV  cities  (those  with  10,000  plus  populations) \nand 75% in class I cities (those with populations of 100,000 plus). \nEnormous amounts of investment are still required in cities that do \nnot fall under the JNNURM. \n\nIn  recognition  of  these  huge  needs,  India  adopted  a  national \nhousing and habitat policy that targeted the provision of 2 million \nadditional  housing  units  each  year  for  the  urban  poor.  Individual \nprovinces and cities have also enacted legislation ensuring security \nof tenure rights to the urban poor. For example, the Kolkata Tenancy \nAct of 1981, as amended, provided for the regularization of slums \non private land and prohibited the eviction of squatters. By 2006, \nabout 2.1 million slum households had been regularized under the \nscheme.  In  Madhya  Pradesh,  under  the  Patta  Act,  about  150,000 \npattas or traditional tenure rights have been conferred to more than \n800,000 people. A unique PSP scheme was carried out in Haryana \nstate adjoining the national capital territory of Delhi whereby pri-\nvate developers were given the right to undertake large-scale land \nassembly for housing and other development schemes. This project \naccelerated the availability of serviced land and lowered land prices, \nmaking it possible for even low-income families to build their own \nhomes. In Lucknow, the city government authorized developers to \nbuild houses on government land with the provision that a certain \nproportion  of  the  houses  would  be  sold  to  low-income  groups  at \naffordable  rates.  Similar  approaches  have  also  been  tried  in Tamil \nNadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.\n\nAside from housing, India has also pursued programs to make \nbasic  services  accessible  to  the  urban  poor.  In  1996,  the  National \nSlum Development Program financially assisted local governments \nto provide infrastructure such as water supply, storm water drains, \nsewers,  community  toilets,  street  lights,  and  paved  lanes  in  areas \noccupied  by  the  urban  poor.  In  addition,  about  10%  of  financial \nassistance  was  earmarked  for  shelter.  In  1992,  a  scheme  for  pay \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_37   37\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM\n\n\f38  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\ntoilets  was  introduced  for  pavement  dwellers.  Another  project  on \ncommunity toilets was launched under the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan \nscheme  in  2001  whereby  an  estimated  20%  of  the  project  budget \nwas  allocated  to  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  community \ntoilets. \n\nA  number  of  local  governments  in  India  carried  out  projects \ntargeting  the  urban  poor.  Under  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Slum  Area \n(Improvement  and  Clearance)  Act  of  1976,  water  taps,  latrines, \npaved roads, and drains were provided to residents of areas marked \nas  \u201cslums  for  improvement.\u201d  In  Pune,  the  municipal  corpora-\ntion  went  into  a  partnership  with  nongovernment  organizations \nand  community  groups  in  a  public  sanitation  program. The  Pune \npartnership invested Rps400 million ($10.1 million) to build more \nthan 400 community toilets that benefited about half a million slum \ndwellers.  In  Delhi,  the  city  government  authorized  private  groups \nto supply water to individual households in Sangam Vihar, a low-\nincome  community  that  was  out  of  the  reach  of  the  water  utility \ncompany. Although the price paid by the residents for the water was \nhigher than what the utility would have charged, the residents were \nhappy because they had access to water.\n\nUrbaN \ufffdovErNaNCE IN INDIa\n\nIn India, by constitutional mandate and statutory enactments, cities \nand towns enjoy a lot of autonomy. The 73rd and 74th amendments to \nthe constitution of India decentralized powers to local governments \nin both urban and rural areas. Local government officials keep their \nautonomy  and  local  political  parties  and  civil  society  groups  en-\ngage  in  hotly  contested  local  elections  focused  on  partisan  issues. \nIn 1993, pursuant to the 74th constitutional amendment, ward com-\nmittees were to be set up in cities with populations of 300,000 and \nabove, though as of 2004, such committees had been set up in only  \n12 states. \n\nThe key feature of urban governance in India is that it is de-\nsigned to be responsive to the needs of all citizens. In the nation\u2019s \ncapital,  for  example,  the  Delhi  Municipal  Corporation  launched \nthe Bhaghidari Initiative in January 2000 that required government \nagencies in charge of key functions like electricity, water supply, and \nsanitation  to  be  more  sensitive  to  the  needs  of  their  clients. The \nBhaghidari  process  relies  on  interactive  meetings  with  citizens\u2019 \ngroups  such  as  resident  welfare  associations,  market  traders\u2019  as-\n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_38   38\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM\n\n\fPolicy Implications of Workshop Discussions  39\n\nsociations,  school  welfare  committees,  and  industrial  associations. \nOne distinct accomplishment of the Bhaghidari initiative is that by \nopening up their activities to their clients, the service agencies have \nbecome more accountable and transparent in their operations. \n\nIn  a  few  metropolitan  areas  in  India,  city  region  governance \nhas  been  advancing  quickly.  The  provisions  of  Article  243ZE  of \nthe 74th amendment to the constitution of India stipulates that in \nevery metropolitan area having a population of one million or more \nand  consisting  of  two  or  more  municipalities  or  panchayats,  there \nshould  be  a  metropolitan  planning  committee. The  principal  task \nof such committees is to prepare a development plan that should be \nfocused on \u201cmatters of common interest between the municipalities \nor  panchayats  including  coordinated  spatial  planning  of  the  area, \nsharing of water and other physical and natural resources, integrated \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure  and  environmental  conservation.\u201d \nTwo-thirds  of  the  members  of  the  planning  committee  are  to  be \ndrawn  from  among  the  elected  members  of  local  bodies,  and  the \nstate  government  appoints  the  remaining  third.  As  of  mid-2005, \nKolkata  had  set  up  its  own  Metropolitan  Planning  Committee, \nwith  the  Metropolitan  Development  Authority  designated  as  the \ncommittee\u2019s secretariat. The states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and \nTamil Nadu had also made some preparations for establishing their \nown  metropolitan  planning  committees.  With  the  support  of  the \nJNNURM reform proposals, other city regions may follow suit.\n\nOne  unintended  effect  of  decentralization  in  India  has  been \nfragmentation of the responsibilities for urban planning and service \ndelivery  among  local  governments.  The  census  in  India  revealed \nthat in 1995, about one third of the country\u2019s total urban population \nlived  in  23  metropolitan  areas. This  proportion  increased  to  38% \nin 2006 when the number of metropolitan areas jumped to 35. By \n2011, it is projected that there will be 75 metropolitan areas in India. \nA noted urban specialist in India has indicated that \u201cvarious studies \nanalyzing geographical, demographic and economic data point out \nthat  these  agglomerations  covering  several  municipal  jurisdictions \nwill be the principal centers of urban population in the future.\u201d He \npointed  out,  however,  that  these  agglomerations  are  not  structur-\nally and functionally able to deal with area-wide problems such as \ntransport,  water  and  sanitation,  employment,  and  environmental \npollution  because  they  are  severely  fragmented  (Sivaramakrishnan \n2007). \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_39   39\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM\n\n\f40  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n\ufffdovErNaNCE of CIty rE\ufffdIoN\ufffd\ufffd  \nIN tHE PrC\n\nThe  PRC  and  India  approach  the  governance  of  city  regions  dif-\nferently. In the PRC, the central Government has power to directly \ninfluence local governance, while in India, local government bodies \nenjoy much autonomy. City governments in the PRC are arranged \nin a hierarchical structure based on political status rather than popu-\nlation  size.  At  the  top  of  the  system  are  four  megacities  that  are  \ndirectly under the control and supervision of the central Government \n(Beijing,  Chongqing,  Shanghai,  and  Tianjin).  Next  are  15  sub- \nprovincial cities such as Shenzhen. Then, there are 268 prefecture-\nlevel cities and 374 county-level cities. Also included as part of the \nPRC\u2019s  urban  hierarchy  are  20,312  small  towns  and  12,000  towns \ndesignated  as  urban  because  of  special  characteristics  (e.g.,  tour-\nism centers, mining towns). Since allocation of central Government  \nresources  is  determined  by  a  city\u2019s  status,  most  local  units  in  the \nPRC aspire for a higher status.\n\nIn the PRC, the power and influence of the central Government \nis strengthened by the Communist Party of China (CPC) that had \n73.3 million members in 2007. The CPC runs a hierarchical power \nstructure parallel to the formal bureaucracy. In effect, the PRC runs \na  field  administration  system,  with  most  local  officials  appointed \nby  the  central  Government  from  the  ranks  of  Communist  Party \nleaders. Direct  citizen participation is found only at the village or \nneighborhood resident committee level where leaders are elected by \nthe people. Even there, however, candidates belonging to the CPC \nare often the ones favored by the electorate. \n\nGenerally, highly centralized governance systems are supposed \nto be inefficient, inflexible, and intolerant of innovation. The PRC \nsystem, however, has developed certain features that seem to make \nit work. For one, the centralized setup makes decision making fast \nand efficient; local governments make development proposals that \nthey submit to higher levels of government that are implemented as \nsoon as these are approved by the State Council in Beijing. Funding \nof development projects is shared by central, provincial, prefecture, \nand metropolitan governments. Large urban infrastructure projects \ncovering several levels of government are subsidized by the center \nand provincial governments until earnings from operations and user \ncharges make them economically viable on their own. \n\nDespite  the  huge  size  of  the  PRC  government  system,  the \ncountry has found a balance between central control and authority \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_40   40\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM\n\n\fPolicy Implications of Workshop Discussions  41\n\ndecentralized to local officials. Thus, the mayors of very large cities \nhave been authorized to approve projects costing $50 million or less. \nHowever,  instead  of  completely  devolving authority  and  power  to \nlocal government officials, the PRC has simply delegated such pow-\ners to them. The center has also instituted explicit and measurable \nstandards of performance and put into place measurable monitoring, \nevaluation, and audit systems to ensure transparency and account-\nability on the part of local officials. Erring officials, including some \nmayors  and  vice  mayors  of  cities  like  Beijing  and  Shanghai,  have \nbeen punished after being found guilty of graft and corruption. \n\nUnified metropolitan governance systems have been used in a \nnumber of city regions in the PRC to achieve better cooperation and \ncoordination. In Shenzhen, for example, the territorial jurisdiction \nof  the  municipal  government  has  been  expanded  several  times  so \nthat it currently includes 6 districts, 51 subdistricts, and 620 locali-\nties  run  by  resident  committees.  For  the  effective  management  of \nurban infrastructure and services, Shenzhen\u2019s jurisdiction has been \nextended  to  the  adjacent  districts  of  Bao\u2019an  and  Longgang.  The \nsame  CCD  approach  has  been  used  in  the  governance  of  Suzhou \nmunicipality. Suzhou city proper only has a population of 2.1 mil-\nlion and covers 1.6 km2, but the whole municipality has 6.8 million \npeople and a territory of 8,488 km2. Within the municipality are the \ncities of Changshu, Kunshan, Taicang, Wujiang, and Zhangjiagang; \nand the districts of Canglang, Jinchang, Pingjiang, Wuzhong, and \nXiangcheng that make up the whole city region. \n\nUrbaN DEvEloPMENt fINaNCIN\ufffd  \naND tool\ufffd\ufffd\n\nBoth  the  PRC  and  India  recognize  that  investment  in  urban  in-\nfrastructure  and  services  is  necessary  to  achieve  overall  economic \nand social development, although the PRC has focused financing of \ninfrastructure and services in a few selected city regions. Basically, \nthere  are  six  sources  of  financing  for  urban  infrastructure  in  the \nPRC: (i) national funds for construction approved by the National \nPeople\u2019s Congress at the start of each budget year that are managed \nby the NDRC; (ii) domestic loans from banks and non-bank finan-\ncial  institutions;  (iii)  enterprise  bonds  floated  by  authorized  units \napproved by the NDRC; (iv) direct and indirect foreign investments \nsuch as those from joint ventures or loans from international finan-\ncial  institutions  like  ADB  and  the  World  Bank;  (v)  self-arranged \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_41   41\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM\n\n\f42  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nfunds by local government bodies or authorized enterprises guaran-\nteed by the central Government or the central bank; and (vi) other \nfunds such as those arising from enterprise operations, user charges \nand penalties, fines, and fees. \n\nSince  2000,  government-owned  or  -controlled  enterprises  in \nthe PRC, including joint ventures, have been allowed to issue proj-\nect bonds to finance infrastructure. By 2005, enterprise bonds had \nreached  CNY435  billion  ($59.9  billion),  which  amounts  to  about \n3.2% of the domestic bond market that also included treasury bonds, \nT-notes,  financial  bonds,  and  commercial  paper. These  enterprise \nbonds  have  to  be  invested  in  fixed  asset  construction  projects  ap-\nproved by the NDRC or its local offices. Bond issuers are required \nto  get  credit  ratings  from  approved  rating  companies  and  bonds \nare  underwritten  by  financial  institutions. Typically,  bonds  mature \nwithin 10 to 20 years at interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 5.8%. \nProceeds from the bonds are taxable.\n\nIn  India,  the  central  and  state  governments  provide  grants \nand  other  financial  assistance  to  local  governments  to  fund  urban \ninfrastructure.  Currently,  JNNURM  has  committed  $6.7  billion \nfor 63 selected ULBs over 7 years until 2012. Recently, cities like \nAhmedabad and Nagpur have been allowed to raise funds from the \nprimary  capital  market  through  issuance  of  municipal  bonds.  All \nbonds in India are issued through structured obligations. Municipal \nbonds are usually accompanied by an escrow mechanism to ensure \npay-back (a form of risk mitigation). Unlike in the PRC, revenues \nfrom  municipal  bonds  are  generally  tax-exempt,  but  they  can  be \ntaxed on a case-to-case basis. A survey on the financial performance \nof municipalities in India has found that the situation needs to be \nstrengthened. The gap between revenue and expenditure will be im-\nproved through the reform agenda under the JNNURM, such as tax \ncollection,  efficient  accounting,  and  strategic  investment  planning \nincluding increased access to capital markets. A high proportion of \nlocal funds is devoted to current operating expenditures and main-\ntenance of municipal services.\n\nThe 74th amendment to the constitution of India decentralized \nfiscal  authority  to  local  governments  which  can  now  fix  tax  rates, \ncharge  fees  for  services,  borrow  funds  for  selected  purposes,  and \nchoose contractors for projects in line with procurement rules. State \nfinance commissions have been set up to examine the financial situa-\ntions of local governments, and recommend ways of improving them. \nAn important innovation concerns the system of financial reporting \nof  India\u2019s  local  governments,  i.e.,  it  has  been  based  on  a  single- \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_42   42\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM\n\n\fPolicy Implications of Workshop Discussions  43\n\nentry (cash-based) system that tracks expenditures against budget-\nary outlays. In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and the cities of Ludhiana, \nJaipur  and  Surat,  a  double-entry  accrual-based  accounting  system \nhas  been  adopted  to  reflect  more  accurately  the  fiscal  situation  of \nmunicipalities.  City  governments  have  also  prepared  accounting \nmanuals, charts for specific accounts, and formats for various activi-\nties. Local financial reporting systems have been changed to match \nnational accounting standards and practices. \n\nPSP has been recently recognized and encouraged strongly in \nIndia under the 11th Five-Year Plan period, but private enterprises \nhave been participating in urban infrastructure operations since the \n1990s  through  contracts  and  franchise  agreements.  Government \nauthorities competitively invite private sector companies to design, \nconstruct, finance, operate, and maintain urban infrastructure proj-\nects through  BOT,  concession, or  franchise agreements. However, \njoint ventures between public and private companies are still quite \nrare. In the few joint venture cases that exist, the Government cre-\nated a special purpose vehicle to manage the Government\u2019s equity \nin the project, which usually ranges from 11% to 26% of total value, \nup to a maximum of 49%. Management of the joint venture project \nis carried out by the private partner. After the concession period, the \nproject reverts to the Government where it may be re-bid for a new \nPSP agreement.\n\nIn  contrast  to  India\u2019s  market-based  system,  the  local  govern-\nments of the PRC initially relied on SOEs to build urban infrastruc-\nture. The activities of the SOEs were financed by direct budgetary \nallocations,  loans  extended  to  SOEs  using  land  as  collateral,  and \nbond  issues.  Later,  the  SOEs  were  encouraged  to  enter  into  joint \nventures with private firms for projects in very large cities, provided \nthe stake of private investors in projects did not exceed 49% of project \nvalue. PSP arrangements did not require private partners to return \nproject assets to the Government after the end of the concession pe-\nriod. However, in smaller cities, PSP modalities such as franchises, \nconcessions, BOT, build-operate-manage, and other arrangements \nwere  allowed,  and  private-sector  investors  were  permitted  to  own \n100% of projects. The project assets, however, had to be transferred \nto the Government at the end of the concession period.\n\nThe  need  for  resources  to  finance  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices has prompted some Asian countries to consider asking for \nassistance from international finance institutions, such as ADB. In \nAugust 2005, ADB approved four new financing instruments and \nmodalities: (i) the multitranche financing facility, (ii) the nonsovereign  \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_43   43\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM\n\n\f44  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nfinancing facility, (iii) the refinancing and restructuring facility, and \n(iv) the local currency loan facility. The first three of these modalities \nwere approved on a pilot basis. In 2005, the local currency loan facil-\nity was mainstreamed. The three other pilot approaches are designed \nto  run  until  August  2008,  although  a  proposal  to  mainstream  the \nmultitranche financing facility has been submitted to ADB\u2019s Board \nof Directors.\n\nA  major  concern  in  Asian  countries  in  urban  infrastructure \nfinance is the need for government sovereign guarantees for loans. \nIn  the  PRC,  it  is  usual  practice  for  the  Government  to  guarantee \nforeign  and  domestic  loans  because  local  governments  are  not  al-\nlowed to incur loans without approval of the central Government. In \nIndia, nonsovereign financing has become more widely possible as \nproject selection criteria, due diligence processes, project risk evalu-\nation, product pricing, and security packages have improved, follow-\ning concepts of sound banking principles. Sectoral and governance \nreforms, such as those carried out under the JNNURM, have also \nhelped to make nonsovereign financing more popular in India. \n\nlaND a\ufffd\ufffd a fINaNCIN\ufffd rE\ufffd\ufffdoUrCE\n\nA distinct advantage in the PRC that is not readily available in India \nis the availability of land as a financing resource. In PRC cities, land is \noften the most important asset used for financing urban infrastructure \nand  services.  By  law,  land  by  itself  has  no  intrinsic  value\u2014it  is  the \nuse of the land that makes it valuable. According to Article 18 of the \nPRC\u2019s  Administration  Law  on  Real  Estate  (1994),  all  fees  paid  by \ndevelopers  for  being  granted  land  use  rights  are  turned  over  to  the \nState Treasury and incorporated in the budget, specifically earmarked \nfor construction of infrastructure and land development. A revision of \nthe same law in 2004 allocated 30% of the land fees to the Ministry \nof Finance and 70% to the relevant local governments. Land is usu-\nally leased for 50\u201370 years. According to the PRC\u2019s circular on the \ncollection of land fees, the land use revenue must be paid in full upon \napproval of the conversion of the land to urban use. \n\nAside from land use fees, the PRC charges a land use tax based \non the area of the land in a transaction. If a house is built, there is \na housing tax equivalent to 1.2% of the value of the house, after a \ndeduction of 10% to 30%. There is also a real estate tax applicable \nonly to land used by foreign enterprises. A value-added tax is im-\nposed on the increase in value arising from transfers of state-owned \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_44   44\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM\n\n\fPolicy Implications of Workshop Discussions  45\n\nland,  buildings,  and  other  structures. There  is  also  a  business  tax \nand a deed tax on the transfer of real estate. Finally, there is a stamp \ntax on contracts and certificates linked to transfers of real property. \nAdministration of urban real estate taxes in the PRC is still undergo-\ning a number of reforms. For example, privately owned apartments \nin multistory structures are not subject to condominium status such \nas in North America or Europe. Thus, collection of taxes and fees \nfrom  individual  owners  rather  than  from  state  councils  becomes \nmore cumbersome. \n\nAlthough most local governments in the PRC have used land \nfor financing urban infrastructure and services, they admit to some \nlimitations for this modality. For one, reliance on land for financ-\ning tends to encourage development of short-term projects. This is \nbecause the unlocked monetary value of the land is finite and funds \nare only available for a short period. Unless the local government has \naccess to other resources that can augment the proceeds from land, it \nwill be forced to invest mainly in short-term projects.\n\nThe situation in India is quite different from the PRC as most \nland  is  privately-owned  and  when  the  Government  needs  to  use \nit  for  public  purposes,  the  Government  has  to  purchase  the  land \nat  fair  market  value  or  use  the  state\u2019s  right  of  \u201ceminent  domain.\u201d \nEncroachment  of  Government  projects  on  private  land,  however, \ncan lead to prolonged litigation and high resettlement costs. Some \nforward-looking local governments in India have engaged in \u201cland \nbanking,\u201d which involves purchasing land for future use while it is \nstill relatively cheap. However, in many cases, private land owners \nimmediately raise the price of their land upon knowing the govern-\nment\u2019s intentions. Farmers and other disadvantaged people whose \nland is taken over for development projects have staged demonstra-\ntions against such moves, at times resulting in violence. Also, most \nlocal governments do not have surplus funds to engage in large-scale \nland  purchases  for  land  banking.  Recognizing  the  need  to  make \nmore  land  available  for  urban  development,  the  Government  of \nIndia has suggested repealing the Urban Land Ceiling Act (ULCA) \nand rationalizing the Stamp Duty Law (reducing the rate from 13% \nto 14% to around 5% of the land transaction value) as mandatory \nreforms that state governments can adopt to encourage the use of \nurban land for development.\n\nIn both the PRC and India, capturing the increase in land value \ncaused  by  the  provision  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services  is  an \nimportant  source  of  financing.  Realistic  assessment  of  land  values \nadjacent  to  a  newly  constructed  road,  for  example,  can  generate  \n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_45   45\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM\n\n\f46  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nsignificant real estate taxes. A tax or penalty on unused or idle land \ncan be an important source of income. It can also force owners to \ndevelop their properties and thereby increase real estate tax proceeds. \nIn  some  countries,  like  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  Government \ncan  agree  to  develop  private  lands  and  then  take  over  part  of  the \ndeveloped land in exchange for its efforts. Land swaps can also be \narranged, whereby land needed for public infrastructure can be ex-\nchanged for land of equal value elsewhere.\n\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_46   46\n\n10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM\n\n\fConclu\ufffdion an\ufffd\ufffd \nRecommen\ufffd\ufffdation\ufffd\n\nGrowth  and  development  are  two  distinct  mat-\nters.  Whereas  growth  refers  to  the  quantitative \nexpansion  of  the  regional  economic  system,  in \nterms of greater and growing productive capacity, \ndevelopment is essentially \u201can innovative process \nleading to the structural transformation of social \nsystems\u201d  (Friedman  1973).  In  this  regard,  it  can \nbe  hypothesized  that  a  well-formulated  urban \ndevelopment  and  associated  policy  could  induce \neconomic growth, as discussed in this paper. \n\nThe  PRC  experience  clearly  suggests  that \nstrategically  planned  and  financed  urbanization \ncould  be  an  effective  instrument  to  lead  rapid \neconomic growth for the entire economy. Urban \nplanning should therefore be proactive to promote \nand facilitate the growth process instead of being \nreactive to deficiency in service provision created \nby unplanned expansion of urban areas. Given the \nlimited financial resources available to the urban \nsector with its low creditworthiness in general, it \nis also necessary to allocate investments in strate-\ngically focused urban centers and industries. The \nsuccessful  experience  of  the  PRC  in  this  regard \nadds  confidence  to  the  effectiveness  of  growth-\npromoting  urbanization  efforts  in  targeted  city-\nregions. \n\nIn most of the cities in South Asia including \nIndia, it has been the case in the past that urban \ninvestments were mainly to meet the backlog of \ndemand  in  basic  urban  services.  The  goal  was \nalmost universally to achieve the minimum level \nof service delivery in water supply, sanitation, and \nother  basic  municipal  services.

In fact, most of the investments were not even sufficient to \nmeet  the  minimum  requirements  of  the  existing  population.  As  a \nresult, urbanization was pushed in an unplanned way by the pressure \nof rural- urban migration. \n\nThe background of the JNNURM is the clear recognition that \neconomic growth higher than 8% cannot be achieved without a re-\nnewed role of urban centers as the engine of growth. Therefore, un-\nder the JNNURM, more financial resources will be channeled into \nthe urban sector. The challenge is how to best use these additional \nresources for maximum developmental impact and improved quality \nof life. By no means is urbanization the sole contributor to economic \ngrowth.  But  there  is  a  strong  need  to  approach  urbanization  in  a \nmore strategic way, envisioning it as the main engine of economic \ngrowth. \n\nKey  messages  derived  from  the  workshop  are

This book \ncontrasts the urban development experiences and practices of the two giant countries \nin Asia: the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India. The Asian Development Bank \nsponsored a 9-day workshop on Urban Development Experience and Visions, and \nsenior-level government officials of India were invited for the workshop, and visited \nBeijing, Suzhou, and Shenzhen in the PRC. Based on the workshop, field visits, and \npolicy discussions on innovative urban development practices, this book summarizes \nkey messages derived from the workshop: the challenges of urbanization should be \nturned around and viewed as opportunities for achieving economic growth. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality \nof life of their people. Despite the region's many successes, it remains home to \ntwo thirds of the world's poor. Nearly 1.7 billion people in the region live on $2 or \nless a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n\n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. \nIts main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, \nloans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. In 2007, \nit approved $10.1 billion of loans, $673 million of grant projects, and technical \nassistance amounting to $243 million.\n\n \n\nU\nr\nb\na\nn\nD\ne\nv\ne\nl\no\np\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \n\n \n\nE\nx\np\ne\nr\ni\ne\nn\nc\ne\n \na\nn\nd\nV\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\ns\n:\n \nI\nn\nd\ni\na\n \na\nn\nd\n \nt\nh\ne\n \nP\ne\no\np\nl\ne\n\u2019\ns\n \nR\ne\np\nu\nb\nl\ni\nc\n \no\nf\n \n\nC\nh\ni\nn\na\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/urbandev\nISBN 978-971-561-744-4\nPublication Stock No. BBK175608\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Urban Development Series\n", "K.
