Its mission is to help its  e a\ndeveloping member countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality  n\nd\nof life of their people. Despite the region's many successes, it remains home to   V\ntwo thirds of the world's poor. Nearly 1.7 billion people in the region live on $2 or  is\nless a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth,  io\nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.  n\ns\n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.  : I\nn\nIts main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue,  d\nloans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. In 2007,  ia\n a\nit approved $10.1 billion of loans, $673 million of grant projects, and technical  n\nd\nassistance amounting to $243 million.  t\nh\ne\n P\ne\no\np\nle\n\u2019s\n R\ne\np\nu\nb\nlic\n o\nf\n C\nh\nin\na\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/urbandev\nISBN 978-971-561-744-4\nPublication Stock No. BBK175608 Printed in the Philippines", "Urban Development Series\n \nK.

The workshop was held in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), where high-level of\ufb01cials of \ncentral, state, and municipal governments from India were invited \nto share the vision and experience of the two countries. Particular \nemphasis was given to the role of the private sector in the provi-\nsion of urban infrastructure and services. The mobile workshop for \nthe participants from India was conducted in the cities of Beijing, \nSuzhou, and Shenzhen.\nThe workshop focuseed on drawing lessons and implications\nfrom the visions and experience of urban development in the PRC \nand India. In considering the private sector\u2019s role, however, the \nworkshop participants went beyond the technical details of PSP.\nThey considered the modality in the broader context of urban  \ndevelopment policies and strategies, includingtheformationofcity\nregions, emergence of clustered cities, iinncclluussiivvee urbandevelopment,\nthe use of landinpromotingPSP,andurbangovernance.\nWe hope that this report will generate interest among numer-\nous stakeholders and provide a better understanding of the key \nchallenges.

From India, 21 high-level officials from the central, state, \nand  municipal  governments  participated  in  the  workshop,  and \nprovided valuable insights and recommendations on their urban  \nvisions. From the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), more than  \n21 key officials representing central,  provincial, municipal, and  \ndistrict governments; academic researchers; and managers of public\u2013\nprivate sector enterprises made presentations to share urban develop-\nment practices and knowledge of the PRC during the workshop. In \nparticular, we would like to thank greatly the Shenzhen and Suzhou \nmunicipalities for hosting and arranging field visits, since the field \nobservations of projects after the 1-day seminar in each municipal-\nity significantly enhanced understanding of the innovativeness of \nurban development practices. Further, with the assistance of the \nChina Center for Town Reform and Development (CCTRD), it \nwas possible that this workshop brought out the best learning pro-\ngram. We also thank the following peer reviewers and assistance \nfrom Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff. Anand Chiplunka and \nSekhar Bonu carefully read the manuscripts and provided valuable \ncomments.

The site visits and dialogue among key officials elicited \na number of insights and policy recommendations, summarized as \nfollows:\n\u2022 City Cluster development approach promises to be an  \neffective instrument in an urban-led development strategy. \nCity cluster development involves the planned provision of \nurban infrastructure and services in an area-wide develop-\nment.

The formulation and adoption of comprehensive \ndevelopment plans can be used as an initial step to show \nthe benefits of the region-wide coordinated approach. \n\u2022 Governance mechanisms for urban regions can take the \nform  of  voluntary  federation  among  local  government \nbodies. As local government fragmentation makes urban \nregion  governance  difficult,  special  purpose  authorities \nor unified governance systems could take a lead role in \nmanaging selected urban infrastructure and services. Such \ngovernance mechanisms can be established by central and \nstate or provincial governments or the political will of \nstrong local leaders.\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_1   1 10/22/2008   7:25:18 PM", "2  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\u2022 Government  officials  need  to  be  entrepreneurial  and \ntap the private sector in designing, financing, as well as  \noperating and maintaining urban infrastructure and ser-\nvices. They can access central government grants, foreign \nand domestic loans, foreign direct investments, enterprise \nbonds, bank loans, and user charges for financing urban \nprojects. Creating an enabling environment for financial \nsustainability is a prerequisite to attract the private sector \nin the urban sector.\n\u2022 Government authorities should offer substantial incentives \nto encourage foreign and domestic investment in the urban \nareas. Incentives can be in the form of the following: ssttaabbllee \nsupply ooofff eeellleeeccctttrrriiiccciiitttyyy aaaannnndddd mmmmuuuunnnniiiicccciiiippppaaaallll sssseeeerrrrvvvviiiicccceeeessss,,,,, fffffuuuuullllllllllyyyyy ssssseeeeerrrrrvvvvviiiiiccccceeeeeddddd \nland ready to receive factories and other structures; tax \nexemption  for  imported  production  inputs;  guaranteed \nrepatriation of profits; professional managers and hheeaalltthhyy,,, \nliterate workers; and personal security. Such incentives \nare particularly important to attract investors in special \neconomic zones, high-tech zones, and other productive \nenclaves.\n\u2022 PSP can include the activities of small community groups \nand not just large public\u2013private enterprises. Such groups \ncan bid to manage urban services such as operation and \nmaintenance of sanitation facilities, water or electricity dis-\ntribution in low income communities, composting of solid \nwaste, and collection of user charges. They can also assist in \nmonitoring the quality and adequacy of urban services by \nproviding immediate feedback to the authorities.\n\u2022 The economic value of state land can be unlocked to  \nfinance urban infrastructure and services. Various schemes \ncan be used to leverage land as a financing tool such as land \nreadjustment, taxation to capture the increased land values \narising from infrastructure provision, efficient land assess-\nment and real estate tax collection, taxes on idle lands, land \nbanking, and reforms such as repeal of the urban land ceil-\ning act in India. \n\u2022 A city\u2019s rich cultural heritage can be used as a productive \nresource in inner-city redevelopment. Inner city areas can \nbe redeveloped by preserving heritage structures like old \nhouses, temples, classical gardens, and other structures. At \nthe same time, governments can provide modern facilities \nlike water supply, sanitation, electricity, telephone lines, \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_2   2 10/22/2008   7:25:18 PM", "Executive Summary  3\nstreet lighting, and paved streets and lanes without alter-\ning the cultural nature of the structures. The redeveloped \ncommunity structures can then be made available to private \nentrepreneurs through PSP schemes such as franchises, \nleases, and contracts for provision of services focusing on \ntourism, trade and commerce, and production of arts and \ncrafts. \n\u2022 While full economic viability of urban infrastructure proj-\nects is a worthy objective, their large size, lumpy capital \nneeds, and long gestation periods may require initial in-\nvestments from the government. Central, provincial or \nstate, and municipal governments, therefore, may have to \nprovide subsidies, especially during the early stages of a \nproject. In general, the policy should be that if an urban \nfacility benefits everyone and not just specific individuals, \nthey should be seen as public goods that can be subsidized. \nHowever, if they are private goods (they benefit only certain \nindividuals) their costs should be recovered from the pri-\nvate beneficiaries.

Trunk infrastructure (roads and \ntransport systems, water, sewerage and sanitation, energy generation \nand distribution, information and communication, solid waste man-\nagement) are used to link together the cities within the cluster. These \ndevelopment plans have also helped the absorption of rural\u2013urban \nmigrants, the so-called floating population that used to be barred from \nsettling in cities by the hukou system. In Shenzhen municipality, for \nexample, the rural hukou was abolished in 2004 and all city residents \nare now entitled to full economic and welfare benefits. \nIn IInnddiiaa,,, ttthhhheeee iiiimmmmppppoooorrrrttttaaaannnncccceeee ooooffff uuuunnnnlllleeeeaaaasssshhhhiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee eeeennnneeeerrrrggggyyyy ooooffff cccciiiittttiiiieeeessss aaaassss \nengines of economic and social development gained more emphasis \nin November 2005 iinn tthhee ffoorrmm ooff tthhee JJJNNNNNNUUURRRMMM...

This new strategy fosters the development of  \nurban regions composed of a number of urban and rural settlements \nof varying sizes. Such comprehensive plans also cover villages, small \ntowns, green field sites, and open spaces. \nA good example of the CCD planning approach is the strategic \nplan for Chongqing that seeks to \u201cdrive economic growth through \nurbanization.\u201d The plan conforms to the \u201cone hour economic circle\u201d \nconcept, with the planning area defined by the space covered in an \nhour by a traveler in a car that starts from the city center. The circle \nincludes the central city and 23 adjacent districts. It encompasses \n28,700 square kilometers (km2) and a population of 22 million that \nwould make the city region the largest in the PRC. By 2015, the plan \nenvisions Chongqing to be an \u201call around well-off society,\u201d where \nper capita GDP would reach CNY77,300 ($10,647). This objective \nwould be achieved by using urban development as a spark that would  \naccelerate the growth of the whole city region.

The districts in \nthe northeastern part of the region would be developed as parts of \nan ecological zone devoted to urban agriculture. The southeastern \ndistricts within the Wuling Mountain area would be devoted to \necological tourism. Within these ecological zones, more than 50% \nof the land would be covered by forests (Zhao 2007).\nAnother example of the CCD approach is special economic zones \nthat are not confined to the city\u2019s formal boundaries but encompass a \nmuch wider region. In August 1980, the National People\u2019s Congress \npassed Regulations for the Special Economic Zone of Guangdong \nProvince and officially designated a portion of Shenzhen as the \nShenzhen Special Economic Zone (SSEZ). In 1984, the PRC fur-\nther opened 14 coastal cities to overseas investment: Beijhai, Dalian, \nFuzhou,  Guangzhou,  Lianyungang,  Nantong,  Ningbo,  Qingdao, \nQinhuangdao, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wenzhou, Yantai, and Zhanjiang. \nSimilarly, the comprehensive plan for the city of Shenzhen effectively \nlinks the PRC\u2019s most rapidly growing city with the Hong Kong and \nMacau special administrative regions, the special economic zone of \nZhuhai, the city of Guangzhou, and small- and intermediate-sized \ncities like Bao\u2019an, Dongguan, Longgang, and Zhongshan, in the \nPearl River delta.

FFiirrsstt,, \nthe rapid growth of the highly urbanized coastal provinces of Fujian, \nGuangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, has left interior provinces like \nAnhui, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous \nRegion far behind. Second, despite the PRC\u2019s egalitarian socialist \nideals, the gap between the rural poor and the urban rich has been \nrapidly widening. Third, while the hukou system has been abolished \nin Shenzhen, it is still enforced in other cities where it has failed to \ncontrol rural\u2013urban migration. About 20% of residents in large cities \nat present are temporary migrants denied access to welfare and social \nbenefits. Fourth, rapid urbanization has eaten up vast tracts of rich \nagricultural land in general, especially in the Pearl River and Yangtze \nRiver deltas, endangering the PRC\u2019s food self-sufficiency.

PSP modalities, therefore, can be viewed as a continuum de-\npending on where authority and responsibility are vested. At one \nend of the band is simple contracting, where the government con-\ntracts out a specific service to private enterprise. At the other end are \nprivatization concessions where private firms are authorized to de-\nsign, finance, build, operate, own, and manage a project. In between \nthese two approaches are design, build or operate contracts, build-\noperate-manage contracts, build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts, \nbuild-own-operate contracts, and buy-build-operate contracts. The \nreputed advantage of using PSP is the ability of private entrepre-\nneurs to operate under open competitive market conditions that en-\nable them to be more efficient in delivering public services. PSP can \nalso tap financial resources like private savings, foreign loans, foreign \ndirect investments, and others not usually available to governments. \nThere are some drawbacks to PSP operations, of course, such as \nhigher costs to consumers because of the need of entrepreneurs to \nbe compensated for the risks taken.

In India, private and public are clearly stipulated in laws, \ntraditions, social norms, and practices. Land, for example, can be \nowned privately in fee simple2 and all benefits accruing to the land \ngo to the owner. If the state is to acquire land for public purposes, \nit has to purchase it at fair market value or resort to the exercise of \n\u201ceminent domain\u201d that may require some litigation. In the PRC, \nafter the success of the Communist revolution in 1949, the state \nconfiscated private land and other properties. According to the con-\nstitution of the PRC, all urban lands belong to the state while rural \nlands are collectively owned. Private individuals and corporate bod-\nies are not allowed to own land. They can only have limited rights \nto \u201cthe use of the land\u201d and to reap the benefits from that use within \nthe period specified in a lease agreement. \nBecause of the unique nature of ownership in the PRC, the use \nof PSP in the country needs further clarification. For example, some \nso-called \u201cprivate sector enterprises\u201d that act as developers, contrac-\ntors, and builders of urban infrastructure and services in the PRC \nwere originally established by communes or collectives under the \n\u201cproduction responsibility system.\u201d When economic reforms were \nlaunched in 1978, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and collectives \nwere made responsible for the productivity and welfare of their \nworkers and members. With the abolition of communes, farmers \nwere allowed to produce crops on lands allotted to them and to \nsell their products in open markets. Collectives were encouraged to \nset up profit-making township and village enterprises that initially \nsparked the PRC\u2019s rapid rate of economic development. In urban \nareas, community and district committees set up enterprises such \nas hotels, grocery stores, construction companies, and housing proj-\nects. Although these enterprises were initially capitalized from the \n\u201cpublic\u201d funds of the collectives, they eventually became \u201cprivate\u201d in \nthe sense that they developed their own institutional identity. From \nthese early beginnings, the \u201cprivate sector\u201d has become a major fac-\ntor in the economic growth of the PRC. The use of PSP became so \nwidespread that in 2005, the National People\u2019s Congress approved \nOpinions to Promoting and Guiding Private Sector Development \nthat clarified how PSP could be used for development projects. PSP \nhas become so widespread that, at present, more than 40% of total \nGDP, 60% of economic growth, and 75% of new employment in the \nPRC is contributed by the private sector. \n2  An estate in land without limitation to any class of heirs or restrictions on transfer \nof ownership.\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_16   16 10/22/2008   7:25:21 PM", "Highlight\ufffd of \nthe Work\ufffdhop \nProgram\nThe highlights of the PRC\u2013ADB\u2013India work-\nshop can be divided into concepts discussed and \nlessons learned during the visits to Suzhou and \nShenzhen and the internal discussions on the last \nday of the workshop in Shenzhen.

(SCCIDC) in August 2001. The main task of the com-\npany is to manage the planning, financing, and construction of \nurban utilities as well as to look after the city\u2019s industrial invest-\nments and assets. Under the agency are five subsidiaries: the Suzhou \nGas Group, Suzhou Port Development Group, Suzhou Sports \nInvestment Development Company, Suzhou Convention Center, \nand the Suzhou Water Affairs Development Company. Aside from \nthese subsidiaries, the agency also has seven holding subsidiaries and \n11 shareholding companies under it. In September 2007, the whole \ncompany had total capital assets amounting to CNY24.5 billion \n($3.37 billion). \nAs Suzhou\u2019s main construction agency, SCCIDC is responsible \nfor the planning, design, and construction of projects, including \nassessment of their economic and financial viability, determination \nof environmental and social impacts, investment of capital, and  \nallocation of land resources. Financing schemes are evaluated by \nthe Suzhou Municipal Finance Bureau and the Finance Evaluation \nCenter. Actual construction and project management is carried out \nby the Suzhou Municipal Construction Bureau and the Suzhou \nMunicipal Public Utilities Bureau. Monitoring of project imple-\nmentation and audit of financial transactions are carried out by the \nSuzhou Municipal Audit Bureau. \nSomewhat parallel to the Suzhou approach, a similar develop-\nment company has been created by the government of Maharashtra \nin India to manage the Navi Mumbai (New Bombay) SEZ. The \nCity  and  Industrial  Development  Corporation  (CIDCO)  was  \nestablished in 2001 as the nodal agency for the development of \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_21   21 10/22/2008   7:25:33 PM", "22  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\nthe SEZ. CIDCO already owns the land for the SEZ. To facilitate \ndevelopment, it transferred all existing infrastructure and land de-\nvelopment rights to a special purpose vehicle that has entered into \njoint ventures with foreign and domestic partners for developing and \nmarketing the SEZ to potential tenants. CIDCO has also offered \nmanagement control and a majority equity stake (from 51% to 74%) \nin the special purpose vehicle to strategic partners. \nIn Suzhou, in addition to creating SCCIDC, the municipality \nhas set up the Suzhou Public Utility Bureau (SPUB) that runs a \nOne-Stop Service Hall designed to immediately react to messages \nfrom city residents. The service hall was opened in April 2005 and \nprovides a hotline system whereby citizens can directly communicate \nwith the municipal government system using a paperless electronic \nmulti-channel system. By dialing 12345 on their telephones, citizens \ncan directly reach the service hall to ask questions, air complaints, \nrequest emergency repairs, or share their ideas on public issues. The \nservice hall has 34 active channels and 60 telephone lines that are \nopen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service hall guarantees a \npositive response within 24 hours to reports requiring emergency \nrepairs while other services are resolved within 3 to 7 days. Since \n2005, the service hall has responded to more than 1.3 million cases \nand reports a problem-solved rate of 99% as well as a public service \nsatisfaction rate of 96%.\nThe operations of SPUB are remarkably similar to those of the \nLudhiana Municipal Corporation (LMC) in India. Like SPUB, the \nLMC was designed to ensure speedy response to citizen complaints. \nIn the case of Ludhiana, the city was divided into four zones, with each \nzone headed by a zonal commissioner. All complaints are handled at \nthe zone level. More importantly, all taxes are now paid at the zone \nlevel as well. Within each zone, a single window system has been \nset up for functions such as paying of taxes, water bills, and license \nfees. The pinpointing of responsibility has made the services more \nefficient and it has maximized transparency and accountability. \nAn important PSP innovation in Suzhou is the direct participa-\ntion of community groups in running the city\u2019s sanitation system. \nBecause the inner city areas of Suzhou have very high residential \ndensities, many of the old homes do not have individual toilets. \nThus, the SPUB has constructed 245 public toilets with an invest-\nment of CNY63 million ($8.7 million). The operation, cleaning, \nand maintenance of each public toilet is contracted out to private \ngroups in a process that relies on secret public bidding. The Suzhou \nEnvironmental Sanitation Administration Agency has 18 environ-\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_22   22 10/22/2008   7:25:33 PM", "Highlights of the Workshop Program  23\nmental sanitation coordinators who regularly inspect the toilets \nto make sure that they are cleaned and maintained properly. Citi- \nzens may also contact the hotline of the service hall to report any \nproblems.\nAnother project in Suzhou carried out under a PSP approach \nwas the solid waste incineration and power generation plant. The \nplant was constructed in 2004 under a BOT scheme with the China \nEverbright International Ltd. of Hong Kong. The city government \nprovided 88 mu of land for the project that covers a total area of  \n126.6  mu. Total  investment  in  the  project  was  CNY520  mil-\nlion ($71.6 million). During the first 6 months of 2007, the plant  \nincinerated about 1,200 tons of solid waste per day and generated \nelectricity of about 310,000 kilowatt-hour (kWh) per day. Because \nof the success of the project, there are plans to expand its capacity to \nhandle as much as 800 tons of solid waste per day. \nAn important management innovation of Suzhou Municipality \nthat facilitates PSP was the streamlining of its project appraisal and \nreview process to cut down processing time. For example, in the \ncase of the Changshu city water project within Suzhou municipal-\nity, the processing time from project initiation to actual contract  \napproval took 325 days. The project was started in 2006 as a partial \nequity transfer venture with investments coming from Hong Kong, \nMacau, and Taipei,China for the Changshu Municipal Public Asset \nManagement Co., Ltd. The various steps in the process were as  \nfollows:\n\u2022 First  phase  project  preparation  (130  days),  including \ndrawing up of project construction and financing plans \nand approval by the Municipal People\u2019s Government of \nChangshu city;\n\u2022 Project announcement (45 days). Five competitive bids \nwere submitted after the announcement.\n\u2022 Due diligence studies (10 days).

By \nSeptember 2007, the Suzhou Municipal Finance Bureau had allo-\ncated about CNY5 billion ($689 million) to the company for vari-\nous projects. In addition, the city government extended loans to the \nvarious subsidiaries of around CNY4 billion ($551 million). Stocks \nwere issued to finance the construction of the Ring Expressway \nand to support projects of the Suzhou Gas Group. The construc-\ntion of the Baodai West Road Bridge and the Tantai Lake Bridge \nwere carried out under a BOT scheme. China Development Bank \nhas financed the construction of the Suzhou train station, the main \nexpressway linking Suzhou to Shanghai, and other road projects. \nCommercial bank loans amounting to CNY5.5 billion ($758 mil- \nlion) have also been tapped to finance various projects. In addition, \nSuzhou Municipality has allocated land of around 1,150 mu to \nSuzhou Industry Co., Ltd. to augment the company\u2019s assets.\nTo attract foreign and domestic investment, Suzhou municipal-\nity offers a number of incentives. For example, investors in the SIP \nare allowed to lease land where they can build their own factories. \nSome may also rent ready-built factory buildings conforming to their \nown specifications. These include terrace factories, fully serviced \nworkshops, free-standing structures, or multistory buildings. SIP \nassures private investors of adequate and reliable sources of energy, \npotable water, efficient sewerage, solid waste collection and disposal, \ngood telecommunication facilities, efficient management, and a \nhighly trained and disciplined work force. Aside from these services, \ninvestors are provided with tax exemptions and privileges. The usual \nrate for corporate income tax is 15%, but this can be reduced or \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_24   24 10/22/2008   7:25:33 PM", "Highlights of the Workshop Program  25\nwaived under certain conditions. For example, if an investor operates \nan enterprise in excess of 10 years, his local income tax is further \nreduced by 3%. Private firms that invest in urban infrastructure \nare given special incentives. If the operation of a company exceeds  \n15 years, the income tax rate is reduced to 7.5% for the next 5 years.\nThe success of SIP can be attributed to the fact that as a joint \nventure between the governments of PRC and Singapore, the park \nmanagement has been vested with a great deal of authority and \npower. For example, SIP can approve foreign-funded projects within \n3 days, provided they are in line with national policy. The Foreign \nAffairs Office of SIP is empowered by the PRC\u2019s State Council \nand the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately approve offi-\ncial visits, issue visa notification letters and official duty passports, \nand apply for visas from foreign embassies in the PRC. The SIP \nis equipped with a complete and modern logistics system. It has \nan independent customs office and a bonded logistics center with \nthe most advanced information technology network in the PRC. \nThe SIP export processing zone has been authorized by the State \nCouncil to independently carry out customs clearance and cut the \ntime for cargo delivery. The workers in SIP also enjoy one of the best \nsocial security systems in the PRC, one patterned after Singapore\u2019s \nCentral Provident Fund that covers housing, medical benefits, re-\ntirement benefits, and social assistance. As such, SIP can effectively \ncompete against other enterprises in hiring the best professionals \nand technical people. Consequently, SIP\u2019s management, staff, and \nworkers all enjoy high morale. \n\ufffd\ufffdHENzHEN MUNICIPalIty vI\ufffd\ufffdIt\nShenzhen  was  established  as  the  PRC\u2019s  first  SEZ  in  1980 \nand  in  the  past  27  years,  it  has  grown  from  a  small  fish-\ning village with 30,000 inhabitants to a megacity of more than  \n10 million (see Figure 5). In 1988, Shenzhen\u2019s status was raised to \na provincial level city in Guangdong, and its territory was expanded \nto 1,800 km2. In 1992, the PRC\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress gave \nShenzhen full authority to pass its own laws and set up zoning codes \nand regulations. In the following year, the city\u2019s territory was ex-\npanded to 2,020 km2.

In the Navi Mumbai SEZ, for ex-\nample, the Maharashtra state government has set aside 4,337 hec- \ntares of land to be developed at a cost of $520 million. As in \nShenzhen and Suzhou, the proximity of the Navi Mumbai SEZ to a \nhigh-growth area (Mumbai with a population of almost 20 million) \nis seen as a definite advantage. Aside from the Navi Mumbai SEZ, \n12 other SEZs all over India have been approved in principle and \nfeasibility studies or detailed project reports are being prepared for \neach one. Three of the SEZs are in Uttar Pradesh (Bhadohi, Greater \nNoida, and Kanpur); two in West Bengal (Kulpi and Salt Lake); two \nin Orissa (Gopalpur and Pradeep); and one each in Andra Pradesh \n(Kakinand), Gujarat (Positra), Karnataka (Hassan), Madhya Pradesh \n(Indore), and Tami Nadu (Nanguneri). \nAs the PRC\u2019s first major experiment in urban-led economic \ndevelopment, Shenzhen has played a major historic role in the \ncountry\u2019s progress. On 1 December 1987, the first public auction \nthat gave a private investor the \u201cright to use\u201d public land through \na long-term lease was held in Shenzhen. In 1988, the first transfer \nof a public housing unit to a private household also occurred in \nthe city. The PRC\u2019s first stock exchange opened in Shenzhen in \n1990. In 1992, Deng Xiaoping signaled the continuation of the \nPRC\u2019s policy of economic reform and opening-up to the outside \nworld during his pivotal \u201csouthern tour.\u201d In Shenzhen, Deng repu-\ndiated the criticisms of his economic policies that arose after the  \n1989 Tiananmen incident and announced that \u201cthe important \nlesson of Shenzhen is to dare to charge into forbidden zones\u201d  \n(Hessler 2006).\nBy the end of 2006, investment in Shenzhen from 102 countries \nand regions had amounted to $53.9 billion supporting some 32,783 \nprograms and projects. Some $21.8 billion of these investments \ncame from Hong Kong, China. The investments have taken many \nforms including wholly-owned foreign enterprises, joint ventures, \ncooperative  enterprises,  joint  stock  companies,  franchises,  and \nother business arrangements. They have covered all fields including \nconstruction, manufacturing, real estate, energy generation, tele-\ncommunications, and infrastructure facilities. Through the years, \nthere has been a shift in the nature of foreign-funded investments \nin Shenzhen from \u201cassembling and processing firms\u201d to more high-\ntech industries. At present, among the investors in Shenzhen are \n101 Fortune 500 enterprises and 341 industrial firms focusing on \nhigh-tech industries.\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_27   27 10/22/2008   7:25:41 PM", "28  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\nThe location of Shenzhen only 20 km from Hong Kong, China \nhas been an important factor in its development. Hong Kong, \nChina\u2019s PSP investments in Shenzhen have gone through at least \nthree stages. Between 1980 and 1987, many Hong Kong, China \nenterprises were mainly engaged in subcontractual arrangements \nwith Shenzhen producers. They provided capital, product designs, \nproduction  technologies,  marketing  know-how,  and  managerial \nservices, while Shenzhen firms provided land, factories, labor, and \nlogistics. Between 1988 and 1992, most Hong Kong, China firms \ntransferred their factories and plants to Shenzhen and adjacent \ncommunities where land was available, labor was cheap, and local \nofficials and entrepreneurs were eager to enter into joint ventures. \nFrom 1993 to the present, almost all direct manufacturing processes \nhave been transferred from Hong Kong, China to Shenzhen and \nits environs. Research and development, venture capital aggregation, \nfinancial strategies, international marketing, and other \u201cintelligence\u201d \nfunctions are still concentrated in Hong Kong, China.

To achieve this goal, \nthe Shenzhen municipal government identified the provision of \nurban infrastructure as the main instrument for speeding up the \ncity region\u2019s growth. The SEZ was built from scratch as the PRC \nauthorities constructed an extensive network of roads; built a rail-\nbased public transit system; opened up four major ports in Chiwan, \nMawan, Shekou, and Yantian; established a region-wide water and \nsewerage system; built the first nuclear-powered energy generating \nplant in the PRC; set up a \u201csmart\u201d information and communication \nsystem using fiber optics; provided exciting tourist sites and facili-\nties; and constructed thousands of apartments for the rapidly grow-\ning population. Most of the infrastructure projects required massive \namounts of public and private capital. They took a long time to build \nand were slow to generate income. Thus, the central Government, \nthe province of Guangdong, Shenzhen municipality, and other lo-\ncal bodies in the region availed of preferential policies extended by \nthe PRC government such as tax exemptions, monetization of land \nvalues, and long-term concession loans. \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_28   28 10/22/2008   7:25:41 PM", "Highlights of the Workshop Program  29\nAn excellent example of PSP for urban infrastructure was the \nestablishment of container ports in four coastal areas of Shenzhen. \nTo finance port development, the PRC utilized four modalities. \nFirst,  loans  were  raised  from  foreign  governments.  The  con-\nstruction of Yantian port, for example, was financed by a loan of  \n\u00a512.3  billion  ($116  million)  from  Japan.  Second,  the  PRC  \napproached foreign private firms to enter into joint venture arrange-\nments with Shenzhen enterprises. Yantian port, the largest container \nport terminal in Shenzhen, was started in 1993 with the signing of \na contract between the PRC and Hutchison Port Holdings, a pri-\nvate Hong Kong company, for the creation of Yantian International \nContainer Terminals, Ltd. (YICT). The joint venture required  \ninvestment of HK$2.4 billion ($307 million), 73% of which was \nprovided by Hutchison. By September 2004, four terminal berths \nhad been constructed in Yantian by the Hutchison-Yantian Port \nGroup, and the last berth alone increased the capacity of the port \nby an additional 2.4 million tons of cargo. A similar PSP arrange-\nment was used for the construction of the Dachanwan Port Area \nContainer Wharf that was a joint venture between the Shenzhen \nPort Group and Modern Terminals of Wharf (Holdings), Ltd. The \n20-year contract for Dachanwan required investment of CNY20 bil- \nlion ($2.7 billion), with about 65% of the amount coming from \nforeign investors, 90% of which came from Hong Kong. \nThird, Shenzhen municipality raised capital by issuing shares \nof stocks for its port operations (Figure 6). To manage its public \nofferings, Shenzhen Port Group established three listing companies \nand these raised CNY1.13 billion ($155.6 million) in just their first \nlisting. Finally, Shenzhen Port Group accumulates funds from the \noperations and profits of its terminals. At present, Shenzhen has \nfour ports with 131 productive berths with a total length of 24.6 km.  \nThe ports have an annual capacity of 140 million tons. The 29 con-\ntainer berths alone can handle containers of 12.7 million twenty-\nfoot equivalent units (TEUs) per year. \nInvestors in Shenzhen and other cities in the PRC have tapped \nthe enterprise bond market to raise capital for infrastructure projects \nand services. While the bond market is still at an early stage in the \nPRC, bonds issued reached CNY101.5 billion ($13.9 billion) as of \n2006, seven times larger than the CNY14.4 billion ($1.9 billion) \nissued in 2004.

An inclusive approach to de-\nvelopment that views urbanization as an energizing element in eco-\nnomic growth includes rural areas on the periphery of cities. The \nemergence of clustered-cities development also includes rural areas \nin comprehensive plans. Inclusive development is benefiting mil-\nlions of rural\u2013urban migrants pushed by poverty from the country-\nside and pulled by the attractions of city life. Since the great majority \nof migrants end up in poorly serviced slums and squatter commu-\nnities, an inclusive development strategy seeks to extend the ben-\nefits of development to these peripheral and hinterland areas. It also  \nincludes benefits to specific groups such as women, youth, the elderly, \nand the socially and economically disadvantaged. Finally, inclusive \ndevelopment focuses not only on the economic and social benefits \narising from urbanization. It also focuses on externalities and what \nto do with such issues as environmental pollution, extinction of spe-\ncies, and global warming. \nThe management of rural\u2013urban migrant flows has been one \nof the main concerns in inclusive development in the PRC. Until \n1979, urban residents in the country made up less than 20% of the \ntotal population. This level has sharply risen since the launching of \neconomic reforms, mainly by relaxation of the hukou system that \nallowed surplus labor from the rural areas to benefit from labor \nshortages in urban areas. By 2004, about 118 million rural residents \nhad flocked to cities, about 70% of whom went to the coastal areas. \nInitially, urban immigration was seasonal and cyclical, with people \ngoing to cities during the slack agricultural production season and \nthen returning for farm work. In recent years, however, migration \nhas become more permanent with migrants now becoming an im-\npoverished underclass in a number of coastal cities. \nThe PRC\u2019s urban-led development strategy opened up job op-\nportunities for many rural\u2013urban migrants in the informal sector, \nconstruction, services, food processing, and manufacturing; however, \nthe sheer volume of migrants became a big burden. Housing for \nthe migrants became a major social problem. In cities like Beijing, \nGuangzhou, and Shanghai some of the migrants initially found \naccommodation in rural areas in the urban periphery where farm-\ners rented out bed spaces to them. Some shanty towns formed on \nthe outskirts of Shenzhen and became problem areas for crime, \ngambling, prostitution, drugs, and other vices. To accommodate mi-\ngrants, most city authorities opened up employment agencies that \nfound jobs for a fee (in Shenzhen, usually about CNY10 or $1.4). \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_36   36 10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM", "Policy Implications of Workshop Discussions  37\nFactories conducted training programs for repetitive work on as-\nsembly lines.

About 58% \nof urban residents do not have potable water within their premises \nand sewerage and low-cost sanitation are available to only 35% of \nresidents in class IV cities (those with 10,000 plus populations) \nand 75% in class I cities (those with populations of 100,000 plus). \nEnormous amounts of investment are still required in cities that do \nnot fall under the JNNURM. \nIn recognition of these huge needs, India adopted a national \nhousing and habitat policy that targeted the provision of 2 million \nadditional housing units each year for the urban poor. Individual \nprovinces and cities have also enacted legislation ensuring security \nof tenure rights to the urban poor. For example, the Kolkata Tenancy \nAct of 1981, as amended, provided for the regularization of slums \non private land and prohibited the eviction of squatters. By 2006, \nabout 2.1 million slum households had been regularized under the \nscheme. In Madhya Pradesh, under the Patta Act, about 150,000 \npattas or traditional tenure rights have been conferred to more than \n800,000 people. A unique PSP scheme was carried out in Haryana \nstate adjoining the national capital territory of Delhi whereby pri-\nvate developers were given the right to undertake large-scale land \nassembly for housing and other development schemes. This project \naccelerated the availability of serviced land and lowered land prices, \nmaking it possible for even low-income families to build their own \nhomes. In Lucknow, the city government authorized developers to \nbuild houses on government land with the provision that a certain \nproportion of the houses would be sold to low-income groups at \naffordable rates. Similar approaches have also been tried in Tamil \nNadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.\nAside from housing, India has also pursued programs to make \nbasic services accessible to the urban poor. In 1996, the National \nSlum Development Program financially assisted local governments \nto provide infrastructure such as water supply, storm water drains, \nsewers, community toilets, street lights, and paved lanes in areas \noccupied by the urban poor. In addition, about 10% of financial \nassistance was earmarked for shelter. In 1992, a scheme for pay \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_37   37 10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM", "38  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\ntoilets was introduced for pavement dwellers. Another project on \ncommunity toilets was launched under the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan \nscheme in 2001 whereby an estimated 20% of the project budget \nwas allocated to the construction and maintenance of community \ntoilets. \nA number of local governments in India carried out projects \ntargeting the urban poor. Under the Madhya Pradesh Slum Area \n(Improvement and Clearance) Act of 1976, water taps, latrines, \npaved roads, and drains were provided to residents of areas marked \nas \u201cslums  for  improvement.\u201d  In  Pune,  the  municipal  corpora-\ntion went into a partnership with nongovernment organizations \nand community groups in a public sanitation program. The Pune \npartnership invested Rps400 million ($10.1 million) to build more \nthan 400 community toilets that benefited about half a million slum \ndwellers. In Delhi, the city government authorized private groups \nto supply water to individual households in Sangam Vihar, a low-\nincome community that was out of the reach of the water utility \ncompany. Although the price paid by the residents for the water was \nhigher than what the utility would have charged, the residents were \nhappy because they had access to water.\nUrbaN \ufffdovErNaNCE IN INDIa\nIn India, by constitutional mandate and statutory enactments, cities \nand towns enjoy a lot of autonomy. The 73rd and 74th amendments to \nthe constitution of India decentralized powers to local governments \nin both urban and rural areas. Local government officials keep their \nautonomy and local political parties and civil society groups en-\ngage in hotly contested local elections focused on partisan issues. \nIn 1993, pursuant to the 74th constitutional amendment, ward com-\nmittees were to be set up in cities with populations of 300,000 and \nabove, though as of 2004, such committees had been set up in only  \n12 states. \nThe key feature of urban governance in India is that it is de-\nsigned to be responsive to the needs of all citizens. In the nation\u2019s \ncapital, for example, the Delhi Municipal Corporation launched \nthe Bhaghidari Initiative in January 2000 that required government \nagencies in charge of key functions like electricity, water supply, and \nsanitation to be more sensitive to the needs of their clients. The \nBhaghidari process relies on interactive meetings with citizens\u2019 \ngroups such as resident welfare associations, market traders\u2019 as-\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_38   38 10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM", "Policy Implications of Workshop Discussions  39\nsociations, school welfare committees, and industrial associations. \nOne distinct accomplishment of the Bhaghidari initiative is that by \nopening up their activities to their clients, the service agencies have \nbecome more accountable and transparent in their operations. \nIn a few metropolitan areas in India, city region governance \nhas been advancing quickly. The provisions of Article 243ZE of \nthe 74th amendment to the constitution of India stipulates that in \nevery metropolitan area having a population of one million or more \nand consisting of two or more municipalities or panchayats, there \nshould be a metropolitan planning committee. The principal task \nof such committees is to prepare a development plan that should be \nfocused on \u201cmatters of common interest between the municipalities \nor panchayats including coordinated spatial planning of the area, \nsharing of water and other physical and natural resources, integrated \ndevelopment of infrastructure and environmental conservation.\u201d \nTwo-thirds of the members of the planning committee are to be \ndrawn from among the elected members of local bodies, and the \nstate government appoints the remaining third. As of mid-2005, \nKolkata had set up its own Metropolitan Planning Committee, \nwith the Metropolitan Development Authority designated as the \ncommittee\u2019s secretariat. The states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and \nTamil Nadu had also made some preparations for establishing their \nown metropolitan planning committees. With the support of the \nJNNURM reform proposals, other city regions may follow suit.\nOne unintended effect of decentralization in India has been \nfragmentation of the responsibilities for urban planning and service \ndelivery among local governments. The census in India revealed \nthat in 1995, about one third of the country\u2019s total urban population \nlived in 23 metropolitan areas. This proportion increased to 38% \nin 2006 when the number of metropolitan areas jumped to 35. By \n2011, it is projected that there will be 75 metropolitan areas in India. \nA noted urban specialist in India has indicated that \u201cvarious studies \nanalyzing geographical, demographic and economic data point out \nthat these agglomerations covering several municipal jurisdictions \nwill be the principal centers of urban population in the future.\u201d He \npointed out, however, that these agglomerations are not structur-\nally and functionally able to deal with area-wide problems such as \ntransport, water and sanitation, employment, and environmental \npollution because they are severely fragmented (Sivaramakrishnan \n2007). \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_39   39 10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM", "40  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\ufffdovErNaNCE of CIty rE\ufffdIoN\ufffd\ufffd  \nIN tHE PrC\nThe PRC and India approach the governance of city regions dif-\nferently. In the PRC, the central Government has power to directly \ninfluence local governance, while in India, local government bodies \nenjoy much autonomy. City governments in the PRC are arranged \nin a hierarchical structure based on political status rather than popu-\nlation size. At the top of the system are four megacities that are  \ndirectly under the control and supervision of the central Government \n(Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin). Next are 15 sub- \nprovincial cities such as Shenzhen. Then, there are 268 prefecture-\nlevel cities and 374 county-level cities. Also included as part of the \nPRC\u2019s urban hierarchy are 20,312 small towns and 12,000 towns \ndesignated as urban because of special characteristics (e.g., tour-\nism centers, mining towns). Since allocation of central Government  \nresources is determined by a city\u2019s status, most local units in the \nPRC aspire for a higher status.\nIn the PRC, the power and influence of the central Government \nis strengthened by the Communist Party of China (CPC) that had \n73.3 million members in 2007. The CPC runs a hierarchical power \nstructure parallel to the formal bureaucracy. In effect, the PRC runs \na field administration system, with most local officials appointed \nby the central Government from the ranks of Communist Party \nleaders. Direct citizen participation is found only at the village or \nneighborhood resident committee level where leaders are elected by \nthe people. Even there, however, candidates belonging to the CPC \nare often the ones favored by the electorate. \nGenerally, highly centralized governance systems are supposed \nto be inefficient, inflexible, and intolerant of innovation. The PRC \nsystem, however, has developed certain features that seem to make \nit work. For one, the centralized setup makes decision making fast \nand efficient; local governments make development proposals that \nthey submit to higher levels of government that are implemented as \nsoon as these are approved by the State Council in Beijing. Funding \nof development projects is shared by central, provincial, prefecture, \nand metropolitan governments. Large urban infrastructure projects \ncovering several levels of government are subsidized by the center \nand provincial governments until earnings from operations and user \ncharges make them economically viable on their own. \nDespite the huge size of the PRC government system, the \ncountry has found a balance between central control and authority \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_40   40 10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM", "Policy Implications of Workshop Discussions  41\ndecentralized to local officials. Thus, the mayors of very large cities \nhave been authorized to approve projects costing $50 million or less. \nHowever, instead of completely devolving authority and power to \nlocal government officials, the PRC has simply delegated such pow-\ners to them. The center has also instituted explicit and measurable \nstandards of performance and put into place measurable monitoring, \nevaluation, and audit systems to ensure transparency and account-\nability on the part of local officials. Erring officials, including some \nmayors and vice mayors of cities like Beijing and Shanghai, have \nbeen punished after being found guilty of graft and corruption. \nUnified metropolitan governance systems have been used in a \nnumber of city regions in the PRC to achieve better cooperation and \ncoordination. In Shenzhen, for example, the territorial jurisdiction \nof the municipal government has been expanded several times so \nthat it currently includes 6 districts, 51 subdistricts, and 620 locali-\nties run by resident committees. For the effective management of \nurban infrastructure and services, Shenzhen\u2019s jurisdiction has been \nextended to the adjacent districts of Bao\u2019an and Longgang. The \nsame CCD approach has been used in the governance of Suzhou \nmunicipality. Suzhou city proper only has a population of 2.1 mil-\nlion and covers 1.6 km2, but the whole municipality has 6.8 million \npeople and a territory of 8,488 km2. Within the municipality are the \ncities of Changshu, Kunshan, Taicang, Wujiang, and Zhangjiagang; \nand the districts of Canglang, Jinchang, Pingjiang, Wuzhong, and \nXiangcheng that make up the whole city region. \nUrbaN DEvEloPMENt fINaNCIN\ufffd  \naND tool\ufffd\ufffd\nBoth the PRC and India recognize that investment in urban in-\nfrastructure and services is necessary to achieve overall economic \nand social development, although the PRC has focused financing of \ninfrastructure and services in a few selected city regions. Basically, \nthere are six sources of financing for urban infrastructure in the \nPRC: (i) national funds for construction approved by the National \nPeople\u2019s Congress at the start of each budget year that are managed \nby the NDRC; (ii) domestic loans from banks and non-bank finan-\ncial institutions; (iii) enterprise bonds floated by authorized units \napproved by the NDRC; (iv) direct and indirect foreign investments \nsuch as those from joint ventures or loans from international finan-\ncial institutions like ADB and the World Bank; (v) self-arranged \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_41   41 10/22/2008   7:25:57 PM", "42  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\nfunds by local government bodies or authorized enterprises guaran-\nteed by the central Government or the central bank; and (vi) other \nfunds such as those arising from enterprise operations, user charges \nand penalties, fines, and fees. \nSince 2000, government-owned or -controlled enterprises in \nthe PRC, including joint ventures, have been allowed to issue proj-\nect bonds to finance infrastructure. By 2005, enterprise bonds had \nreached CNY435 billion ($59.9 billion), which amounts to about \n3.2% of the domestic bond market that also included treasury bonds, \nT-notes, financial bonds, and commercial paper. These enterprise \nbonds have to be invested in fixed asset construction projects ap-\nproved by the NDRC or its local offices. Bond issuers are required \nto get credit ratings from approved rating companies and bonds \nare underwritten by financial institutions. Typically, bonds mature \nwithin 10 to 20 years at interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 5.8%. \nProceeds from the bonds are taxable.\nIn India, the central and state governments provide grants \nand other financial assistance to local governments to fund urban \ninfrastructure. Currently, JNNURM has committed $6.7 billion \nfor 63 selected ULBs over 7 years until 2012. Recently, cities like \nAhmedabad and Nagpur have been allowed to raise funds from the \nprimary capital market through issuance of municipal bonds. All \nbonds in India are issued through structured obligations. Municipal \nbonds are usually accompanied by an escrow mechanism to ensure \npay-back (a form of risk mitigation). Unlike in the PRC, revenues \nfrom municipal bonds are generally tax-exempt, but they can be \ntaxed on a case-to-case basis. A survey on the financial performance \nof municipalities in India has found that the situation needs to be \nstrengthened. The gap between revenue and expenditure will be im-\nproved through the reform agenda under the JNNURM, such as tax \ncollection, efficient accounting, and strategic investment planning \nincluding increased access to capital markets. A high proportion of \nlocal funds is devoted to current operating expenditures and main-\ntenance of municipal services.\nThe 74th amendment to the constitution of India decentralized \nfiscal authority to local governments which can now fix tax rates, \ncharge fees for services, borrow funds for selected purposes, and \nchoose contractors for projects in line with procurement rules. State \nfinance commissions have been set up to examine the financial situa-\ntions of local governments, and recommend ways of improving them. \nAn important innovation concerns the system of financial reporting \nof India\u2019s local governments, i.e., it has been based on a single- \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_42   42 10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM", "Policy Implications of Workshop Discussions  43\nentry (cash-based) system that tracks expenditures against budget-\nary outlays. In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and the cities of Ludhiana, \nJaipur and Surat, a double-entry accrual-based accounting system \nhas been adopted to reflect more accurately the fiscal situation of \nmunicipalities. City governments have also prepared accounting \nmanuals, charts for specific accounts, and formats for various activi-\nties. Local financial reporting systems have been changed to match \nnational accounting standards and practices. \nPSP has been recently recognized and encouraged strongly in \nIndia under the 11th Five-Year Plan period, but private enterprises \nhave been participating in urban infrastructure operations since the \n1990s through contracts and franchise agreements. Government \nauthorities competitively invite private sector companies to design, \nconstruct, finance, operate, and maintain urban infrastructure proj-\nects through BOT, concession, or franchise agreements. However, \njoint ventures between public and private companies are still quite \nrare. In the few joint venture cases that exist, the Government cre-\nated a special purpose vehicle to manage the Government\u2019s equity \nin the project, which usually ranges from 11% to 26% of total value, \nup to a maximum of 49%. Management of the joint venture project \nis carried out by the private partner. After the concession period, the \nproject reverts to the Government where it may be re-bid for a new \nPSP agreement.\nIn contrast to India\u2019s market-based system, the local govern-\nments of the PRC initially relied on SOEs to build urban infrastruc-\nture. The activities of the SOEs were financed by direct budgetary \nallocations, loans extended to SOEs using land as collateral, and \nbond issues. Later, the SOEs were encouraged to enter into joint \nventures with private firms for projects in very large cities, provided \nthe stake of private investors in projects did not exceed 49% of project \nvalue. PSP arrangements did not require private partners to return \nproject assets to the Government after the end of the concession pe-\nriod. However, in smaller cities, PSP modalities such as franchises, \nconcessions, BOT, build-operate-manage, and other arrangements \nwere allowed, and private-sector investors were permitted to own \n100% of projects. The project assets, however, had to be transferred \nto the Government at the end of the concession period.\nThe need for resources to finance urban infrastructure and \nservices has prompted some Asian countries to consider asking for \nassistance from international finance institutions, such as ADB. In \nAugust 2005, ADB approved four new financing instruments and \nmodalities: (i) the multitranche financing facility, (ii) the nonsovereign  \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_43   43 10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM", "44  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\nfinancing facility, (iii) the refinancing and restructuring facility, and \n(iv) the local currency loan facility. The first three of these modalities \nwere approved on a pilot basis. In 2005, the local currency loan facil-\nity was mainstreamed. The three other pilot approaches are designed \nto run until August 2008, although a proposal to mainstream the \nmultitranche financing facility has been submitted to ADB\u2019s Board \nof Directors.\nA major concern in Asian countries in urban infrastructure \nfinance is the need for government sovereign guarantees for loans. \nIn the PRC, it is usual practice for the Government to guarantee \nforeign and domestic loans because local governments are not al-\nlowed to incur loans without approval of the central Government. In \nIndia, nonsovereign financing has become more widely possible as \nproject selection criteria, due diligence processes, project risk evalu-\nation, product pricing, and security packages have improved, follow-\ning concepts of sound banking principles. Sectoral and governance \nreforms, such as those carried out under the JNNURM, have also \nhelped to make nonsovereign financing more popular in India. \nlaND a\ufffd\ufffd a fINaNCIN\ufffd rE\ufffd\ufffdoUrCE\nA distinct advantage in the PRC that is not readily available in India \nis the availability of land as a financing resource. In PRC cities, land is \noften the most important asset used for financing urban infrastructure \nand services. By law, land by itself has no intrinsic value\u2014it is the \nuse of the land that makes it valuable. According to Article 18 of the \nPRC\u2019s Administration Law on Real Estate (1994), all fees paid by \ndevelopers for being granted land use rights are turned over to the \nState Treasury and incorporated in the budget, specifically earmarked \nfor construction of infrastructure and land development. A revision of \nthe same law in 2004 allocated 30% of the land fees to the Ministry \nof Finance and 70% to the relevant local governments. Land is usu-\nally leased for 50\u201370 years. According to the PRC\u2019s circular on the \ncollection of land fees, the land use revenue must be paid in full upon \napproval of the conversion of the land to urban use. \nAside from land use fees, the PRC charges a land use tax based \non the area of the land in a transaction. If a house is built, there is \na housing tax equivalent to 1.2% of the value of the house, after a \ndeduction of 10% to 30%. There is also a real estate tax applicable \nonly to land used by foreign enterprises. A value-added tax is im-\nposed on the increase in value arising from transfers of state-owned \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_44   44 10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM", "Policy Implications of Workshop Discussions  45\nland, buildings, and other structures. There is also a business tax \nand a deed tax on the transfer of real estate. Finally, there is a stamp \ntax on contracts and certificates linked to transfers of real property. \nAdministration of urban real estate taxes in the PRC is still undergo-\ning a number of reforms. For example, privately owned apartments \nin multistory structures are not subject to condominium status such \nas in North America or Europe. Thus, collection of taxes and fees \nfrom individual owners rather than from state councils becomes \nmore cumbersome. \nAlthough most local governments in the PRC have used land \nfor financing urban infrastructure and services, they admit to some \nlimitations for this modality. For one, reliance on land for financ-\ning tends to encourage development of short-term projects. This is \nbecause the unlocked monetary value of the land is finite and funds \nare only available for a short period. Unless the local government has \naccess to other resources that can augment the proceeds from land, it \nwill be forced to invest mainly in short-term projects.\nThe situation in India is quite different from the PRC as most \nland is privately-owned and when the Government needs to use \nit for public purposes, the Government has to purchase the land \nat fair market value or use the state\u2019s right of \u201ceminent domain.\u201d \nEncroachment of Government projects on private land, however, \ncan lead to prolonged litigation and high resettlement costs. Some \nforward-looking local governments in India have engaged in \u201cland \nbanking,\u201d which involves purchasing land for future use while it is \nstill relatively cheap. However, in many cases, private land owners \nimmediately raise the price of their land upon knowing the govern-\nment\u2019s intentions. Farmers and other disadvantaged people whose \nland is taken over for development projects have staged demonstra-\ntions against such moves, at times resulting in violence. Also, most \nlocal governments do not have surplus funds to engage in large-scale \nland purchases for land banking. Recognizing the need to make \nmore land available for urban development, the Government of \nIndia has suggested repealing the Urban Land Ceiling Act (ULCA) \nand rationalizing the Stamp Duty Law (reducing the rate from 13% \nto 14% to around 5% of the land transaction value) as mandatory \nreforms that state governments can adopt to encourage the use of \nurban land for development.\nIn both the PRC and India, capturing the increase in land value \ncaused by the provision of urban infrastructure and services is an \nimportant source of financing. Realistic assessment of land values \nadjacent to a newly constructed road, for example, can generate  \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_45   45 10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM", "46  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\nsignificant real estate taxes. A tax or penalty on unused or idle land \ncan be an important source of income. It can also force owners to \ndevelop their properties and thereby increase real estate tax proceeds. \nIn some countries, like the Republic of Korea, the Government \ncan agree to develop private lands and then take over part of the \ndeveloped land in exchange for its efforts. Land swaps can also be \narranged, whereby land needed for public infrastructure can be ex-\nchanged for land of equal value elsewhere.\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_46   46 10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM", "Conclu\ufffdion an\ufffd\ufffd \nRecommen\ufffd\ufffdation\ufffd\nGrowth and development are two distinct mat-\nters. Whereas growth refers to the quantitative \nexpansion of the regional economic system, in \nterms of greater and growing productive capacity, \ndevelopment is essentially \u201can innovative process \nleading to the structural transformation of social \nsystems\u201d (Friedman 1973). In this regard, it can \nbe  hypothesized  that  a  well-formulated  urban \ndevelopment and associated policy could induce \neconomic growth, as discussed in this paper. \nThe PRC experience clearly suggests that \nstrategically planned and financed urbanization \ncould be an effective instrument to lead rapid \neconomic growth for the entire economy. Urban \nplanning should therefore be proactive to promote \nand facilitate the growth process instead of being \nreactive to deficiency in service provision created \nby unplanned expansion of urban areas. Given the \nlimited financial resources available to the urban \nsector with its low creditworthiness in general, it \nis also necessary to allocate investments in strate-\ngically focused urban centers and industries. The \nsuccessful experience of the PRC in this regard \nadds confidence to the effectiveness of growth-\npromoting urbanization efforts in targeted city-\nregions. \nIn most of the cities in South Asia including \nIndia, it has been the case in the past that urban \ninvestments were mainly to meet the backlog of \ndemand in basic urban services. The goal was \nalmost universally to achieve the minimum level \nof service delivery in water supply, sanitation, and \nother basic municipal services. Forward-looking \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_47   47 10/22/2008   7:25:58 PM", "48  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\nplanning to create modern infrastructure for attracting new invest-\nments was beyond the consideration of most state and city govern-\nments. In fact, most of the investments were not even sufficient to \nmeet the minimum requirements of the existing population. As a \nresult, urbanization was pushed in an unplanned way by the pressure \nof rural- urban migration. \nThe background of the JNNURM is the clear recognition that \neconomic growth higher than 8% cannot be achieved without a re-\nnewed role of urban centers as the engine of growth. Therefore, un-\nder the JNNURM, more financial resources will be channeled into \nthe urban sector. The challenge is how to best use these additional \nresources for maximum developmental impact and improved quality \nof life. By no means is urbanization the sole contributor to economic \ngrowth. But there is a strong need to approach urbanization in a \nmore strategic way, envisioning it as the main engine of economic \ngrowth. \nKey messages derived from the workshop are summarized  \nbelow. \n\u2022 Urbanization should be used as an effective instrument for \neconomic growth;\n\u2022 Development plans should encompass city regions and \nclusters of cities, and not be confined to administrative \nboundaries;\n\u2022 City region plans should include rural areas and provide \nmeasures  for  absorbing  rural\u2013urban  migrants  such  as  \nproviding  access  to  employment,  education,  and  skills \ntraining;\n\u2022 An appropriate institutional framework (i.e., a metropoli-\ntan planning authority) is necessary for formulating and \nimplementing city-region plans;\n\u2022 Decentralization and grant of local autonomy are impor-\ntant for democratic governance and citizen participation;\n\u2022 Urban governance structures should be able to manage the \nentire city region to which they refer, and should not be \nfragmented according to the formal political or administra-\ntive boundaries of local governments;\n\u2022 The roles of central, state or provincial, metropolitan, and \ncity governments differ in terms of the urban development \nprocess, and should be clearly defined and described in \nnational legislation to achieve efficiency in their respective \nroles;\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_48   48 10/22/2008   7:25:59 PM", "Conclusion and Recommendations  49\n\u2022 The central and state and/or provincial governments should \nplay a more active role in financing urban infrastructure \nand services; and these governments should not hesitate to \nsubsidize projects that help accelerate long-term economic \ngrowth;\n\u2022 Local governments should expand their revenue base by \nimproving the efficiency of tax collection, collecting user \ncharges for services, and capturing the increased values of \nland and properties due to the provision of infrastructure \nand services;\n\u2022 Public land can serve as a financing tool by unlocking its \n\u201cuse value\u201d and monetizing it as a governmental input for \nfinancing urban infrastructure and services; and\n\u2022 Governments should capture increases in the value of land \nby reassessing the value of properties that benefit from \nurban infrastructure and levying appropriate taxes on the \nimprovements of basic urban services; and\n\u2022 Plans  for  whole  city  regions  may  include  rural  areas; \nthe concept of rural\u2013urban dichotomy should be aban-\ndoned in development planning and governance, as it  \ncreates divisiveness and fragmentation.\nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_49   49 10/22/2008   7:25:59 PM", "Urban Visions_India and the PRC_50   50 10/22/2008   7:25:59 PM", "Summary\ufffd  \nRe\ufffdult\ufffd of \nWork\ufffdhop \nDi\ufffdcu\ufffd\ufffdion\ufffd \nUrban Visions_India and the PRC_51   51 10/22/2008   7:25:59 PM", "52  Urban Development Experience and Visions: India and the People\u2019s Republic of China\nPolicy Suggestions and Recommendations Development planning should be proactive and not reactiveUrbanization should be used as an instrument for developmentIt may be better to concentrate infrastructure investments in a few selected cities and regions to accelerate economic growthSpatial aspects should be included in economic development plansDevelopment plans should encompass city regions and clusters of cities, and not be confined to formal city boundariesThe central city and surrounding city clusters should be linked together by efficient transport infrastructure and servicesCity region plans should include rural areas and provide for absorbing rural\u2013urban migrantsSelf-contained satellite towns should be developed as integral parts of city region plansCity region plans should specify the role of PSP in providing urban infrastructure and servicesInner-city redevelopment through cultural conservation and tourism projects should be part of city region plansAn appropriate institutional framework (metropolitan planning authority) is necessary for formulating and implementing city region plans continued on next page\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nInformation Materials  and Presentations Development strategy of urbanization in the PRC (Wang Qunhui)Rehabilitation and conservation of historic houses and streets in Suzhou (Cao Qinliang)Planning and infrastructure financing of Suzhou Industrial Park  (Liu Dongjun)Urbanization policy and strategic development in the PRC  (Prof. A.
