Modest \nrecovery in Southeast Asia and sustained growth in India will partly offset continued moderation in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and associated spillover into neighboring economies. Risks to the growth outlook \ntilt to the downside: future US interest rate hikes that may intensify global financial volatility, a sharper-than-\nforecast growth slowdown in the People\u2019s Republic of China that would hurt regional exports and growth, \nemerging producer price deflation that may undermine growth in some economies, tepid prices for oil and \nother commodities, and El Ni\u00f1o.  \nThis edition highlights the need to invigorate developing Asia\u2019s potential growth, whose decline since its 2007 \npeak explains much of the region\u2019s growth slowdown since the global financial crisis. To ensure a healthy future \nfor potential growth, Asia must employ the full range of policy responses to augment labor supply, improve \nlabor productivity, enhance institutional quality, and maintain macroeconomic stability. \nAA\nsia\u2019sSIA\n PoN\nten D\ntiaEV\nAbout the Asian Development Bank l GE\nrowLO\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty.

notwithstanding, developing Asia will continue to \ncontribute 60% of world growth. Weighing sluggish growth in the \nUnited States and the euro area, the transition of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) to an economy led by consumption and services, and \nIndia\u2019s ongoing structural reform, Asian Development Outlook 2016\nforecasts 5.7% growth for developing Asia in 2016 and 2017. \nMost subregions of developing Asia will see growth slow in 2016 \nbefore rebounding in 2017. Growth in South Asia, whose expansion \nwas the highest of any subregion in 2015, is expected at 6.9% in 2016, \naccelerating to 7.3% in 2017 as reforms are implemented in India\u2019s \nfinancial sector. East Asia will see growth moderate in both years in \ntandem with the PRC, whose growth is expected to slow to 6.5% this \nyear and 6.3% in 2017 as it contends with reduced investment among \nother factors. \nEconomic performance is poised to improve in Southeast Asia as the \nlarge economies of Indonesia and the Philippines ramp up investment, \nViet Nam sustains its expansion, and Thailand gathers momentum, \nthough Malaysia will slow further with weak oil prices. Meanwhile, \nlow\u00a0commodity prices will curb growth prospects in Central Asia and \nthe Pacific, in part by constraining fiscal spending. \nRegional inflation has been favorable to Asian economies, as low \ninternational food and fuel prices helped cut average inflation to 2.2% in \n2015 from 3.0% in 2014. Inflation is likely to pick up to 2.5% in 2016 as \ndomestic demand strengthens and to 2.7% in 2017 as global commodity \nprices recover slightly.\nUncertainties abound in the global economic environment, and \nrisks to developing Asia\u2019s growth are mostly on the downside. This \npublication examines the implications of an unexpectedly sharp \nslowdown in the PRC, which could cut both global and regional growth \nby nearly 1.8 percentage points. The impact in the region would be \nmainly on trade volumes and commodity prices, the severity felt by each \nneighbor economy depending on its ability to accommodate and adapt to \nthe changes. \nProducer price deflation is associated with lower investment and \nlower economic growth and has become an emerging concern for many \nAsian economies. Thus, policy makers are advised to pay attention to \nfalling producer prices because they compound producers\u2019 debt burdens \nand weigh on their investment decisions. \nAsian Development Outlook 2016 examines in detail how the growth \nslowdown in Asia since the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 has \naffected the region\u2019s potential growth. Defined as the maximum growth \nrate associated with the full employment of productive resources, \npotential growth is determined by changing demographics and labor \nproductivity.", "Potential growth in the region has fallen by 2 percentage points \nsince the global financial crisis. Absent structural reform, many \neconomies in the region will see a further decrease because of \nunfavorable demographics, convergence with advanced economies, and \nspillover from growth moderation in the PRC. \nTo invigorate potential growth, policy reforms are needed. On top of \npromoting sound macroeconomic management, reform should offset the \nimpact of less-favorable demographics by increasing female participation \nin the workforce, extending the working age, and raising labor \nproductivity through capital investment and measures to reduce factor \nmisallocation. Policies such as these can help sustain growth, thereby \nraising living standards and further reducing poverty in Asia. \nTAKEHIKO NAKAO \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank", "Acknowledgments\nAsian Development Outlook 2016 was prepared by staff of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the Central and West Asia Department, \nEast Asia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, \nSoutheast Asia Department, and Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department, as well as in ADB resident missions. \nRepresentatives of these departments constituted the Regional \nEconomic Outlook Task Force, which met regularly to coordinate and \ndevelop consistent forecasts for the region.\nThe authors who contributed the sections are bylined in each \nchapter.

Gross domestic product (GDP) \nin the region will expand by 5.7% in 2016 and 2017, decelerating from 5.9% in 2015 \nin a difficult and uncertain global environment. Solid growth in India and a pickup in \naggregate growth in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will help \nbalance continued growth moderation in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Despite \nthe slight dip, the region will contribute around 60% of global growth in the next 2 years, \nclose to its contribution in the past 5 years.\n\u00bb Growth in the industrial economies is unlikely to pick up this year. Aggregate \ngrowth in the major industrial economies\u2014the United States (US), the euro area, \nand Japan\u2014will stay at 1.8% in 2016 before inching up to 1.9% in 2017. In the US, \nexpanding private consumption and investment will be tempered by weak external \ndemand. While recovery in the euro area is gradually gaining ground, domestic and \nexternal risks abound, keeping growth from breaking out of its slow 2015 pace. \nJapan\u2019s growth will improve slightly, helped by a pickup in private consumption this \nyear in anticipation of a value-added tax increase next year.\n\u00bb The PRC continues to shift away from its reliance on investment and exports.\nGrowth slowed further last year as exports faltered, labor shortages began to bite, \nand the short-term adverse impact of supply-side reform took its toll. Reduced \ninvestment in industries with excess capacity will be another factor moderating \ngrowth still further to 6.5% (within the government\u2019s target range of 6.5%\u20137.0%) and \nto 6.3% next year. \n\u00bb Strong public investment boosted growth in India despite weak exports. Reform \ngeared to attract more foreign direct investment progressed, and the authorities \nworked to repair corporate and bank balance sheets. While macroeconomic \nfundamentals are strong, progress on major structural reform is expected to be \ngradual. Growth momentum will be sustained at 7.4% in 2016 before picking up to \n7.8% in 2017 with measures to fund stalled projects and an uptick in bank credit. \n\u00bb Stronger growth is seen for ASEAN. Aggregate growth in the 10 ASEAN economies \nis forecast to accelerate steadily from 4.4% in 2015 to 4.5% in 2016 and 4.8% in \n2017. Growth will be led by Indonesia as it ramps up investment in infrastructure \nand implements policy reform that spurs private investment. Solid consumption \nand investment will provide a lift to the Philippine economy. Thailand\u2019s recovery \nis expected to gather momentum, and Viet Nam will sustain vigorous expansion. \nIn\u00a0contrast, Malaysian growth will slip further with low oil prices and weak external \ndemand. \n\u00bb Low commodity prices weigh on growth prospects in Central Asia and \nthe\u00a0Paci\ufb01c. Continued low oil prices are exerting pressure on \ufb01scal spending in \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste, slowing subregional \ngrowth in Central Asia and the Paci\ufb01c. While the expected pickup in oil prices will \nbring some relief in 2017, growth is expected to remain below the 5-year average \npace to the forecast horizon.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xiii\n(cid:31) Most Asian economies bene\ufb01t from low international food and fuel prices. The \nlarge fall in oil and food prices tempered in\ufb02ation. The regional rate eased from 3.0% \nin 2014 to 2.2% in 2015 as global oil prices fell by 47% and average food prices by 15%. \nRegional\u00a0in\ufb02ation will revive to 2.5% in 2016 as domestic demand strengthens and rise \nfurther to 2.7% in 2017 as global commodity prices recover. \n(cid:31) The regional current account surplus will narrow this year and next. Subdued \ndemand for manufacturing exports and continued low commodity prices will trim \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s current account surplus from the equivalent of 2.9% of regional GDP \nin 2015 to 2.6% in 2016 and further to 2.4% in 2017. Yet the region\u2019s increasing global \neconomic weight means its surplus will widen slightly to 0.7% of world GDP in 2016, \nup\u00a00.1 percentage points from last year. \n(cid:31) Risks to the regional growth forecast remain tilted to the downside. Future interest \nrate hikes by the US Federal Reserve may tighten global \ufb01nancing conditions. This, \ncombined with broader weakness in emerging markets, could heighten investors\u2019 risk \naversion and intensify global \ufb01nancial market volatility. A sharper-than-forecast growth \nslowdown in the PRC would further dim the global outlook and directly hurt regional \nexports and growth. Tepid prices for oil and other commodities cast a shadow over the \nprospects of Asia\u2019s commodity-dependent economies. Finally, El Ni\u00f1o looms as a major \nweather risk for economies that rely on agriculture. While consumer price in\ufb02ation is \ngenerally low but positive, producer price de\ufb02ation has emerged as a new spoiler in the \nPRC and other Asian economies. \nSpillover from the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(cid:31) Growth moderation in the PRC weighs on regional growth. Simulations estimate \nthat the drop in PRC growth may have shaved as much as 0.3 percentage points from \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s outlook.The PRC effect is largely centered on Asia, re\ufb02ecting strong \nregional trade and production links. In contrast, the impact on the US and the euro area \nthrough trade is largely offset by the bene\ufb01t of lower commodity prices. The unlikely \nevent of a sharp growth decline in the PRC triggered by some type of \ufb01nancial shock \nwould be signi\ufb01cant, however, lopping nearly 1.8 percentage points off global growth. \nSimulations of such a scenario show oil prices down by 10%\u201325% relative to the baseline, \nwhile growth in Japan would lose 1.5 percentage points and in developing Asia 1.8 points. \n(cid:31) Ongoing structural change in the PRC is affecting its import structure.\u00a0Contributing \nto its growth moderation, the PRC is currently undergoing a structural transformation from \ngrowth led by exports and investment to growth grounded on domestic consumption. \nAs\u00a0a result, while investment has been the main growth driver since\u00a02001\u2014peaking at \nan 86% contribution to growth in 2009\u2014consumption now contributes more than half. \nThe\u00a0PRC role in global value chains is also changing as rising wages shunt some activities \nto lower-cost economies and technological upgrades shift the PRC into activities that add \nmore value. These structural changes are re\ufb02ected in the sharp drop in the share of parts \nand components in PRC imports since the mid-2000s and a slight rise in the share of \nconsumer goods.\n(cid:31) How PRC structural change affects an economy depends on the relationship. \nSpillover from PRC restructuring into particular economies will differ depending on \nwhether they are exporters of consumer goods, parts of the same production chain, or ", "xiv\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\ncompetitors, either current or potential. For example, the Republic of Korea has lost \nmarket share as the PRC increasingly mastered high technology, but Viet Nam has \nincreased its share of parts and components in PRC imports as it has taken over from the \nPRC lower-skilled tasks within production chains. Other Asian economies may bene\ufb01t \ntoo as the PRC withdraws from labor-intensive pursuits. Bangladesh, for one, has taken \nup garment manufacturing to become the world\u2019s second-largest garment exporter.\nEmergent producer price de\ufb02ation \n(cid:31) The PRC and some other Asian economies recently experienced producer price \nde\ufb02ation. Slowing economic growth has combined with sharply lower oil prices to \npush producer price in\ufb02ation into negative territory, though consumer price in\ufb02ation \nremains mostly positive. In 2015, the PRC saw producer prices contract by 5.2% and, \nby February\u00a02016, it had endured 48 consecutive months of producer price de\ufb02ation. \nDe\ufb02ation in the PRC may be transmitted to its neighbors through lower export prices, \nespecially if the renminbi depreciates. In fact, producer prices fell in 2015 by 9.1% in \nSingapore, 6.7% in the Philippines, and 4.8% in Malaysia\u2014and by smaller margins in \nIndia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Hong Kong, China. \n(cid:31) Commodity price shocks get diluted along distribution chains before affecting \nconsumers. The pass-through of oil and food prices thus tends to be lower for consumer \nprices than for producer prices. In the PRC, for example, the cumulative pass-through of \na 1% drop in global oil prices after 4 quarters reached 14 basis points for producer prices \nbut only 3 basis points for consumer prices. In Thailand, the cumulative pass-through \nof a 1% drop in global food prices reached 21 basis points for producer prices but only \n7 basis points for consumer prices. The lower rate of consumer price pass-through may \nexplain why episodes of producer price de\ufb02ation are less rare. \n(cid:31) Historically, falling producer prices are more common than declines in consumer \nprices. An empirical study of 38 economies found 389 episodes of producer price \nde\ufb02ation from 1947 to 2014 but only 145 episodes of consumer price de\ufb02ation. In \ntheory, de\ufb02ation can spark a vicious cycle of weakening demand and falling prices, but \nevidence from episodes of declining consumer prices is mixed. De\ufb02ation in the postwar \nera cannot be accurately assessed by looking only at consumer prices because they may \nnot adequately capture the pressures on \ufb01rms.\n(cid:31) Producer price de\ufb02ation is associated with lower economic growth. Average GDP \ngrowth per capita was lower in an 1870\u20132014 study sample during de\ufb02ationary episodes \nthan during in\ufb02ationary ones. This held whether producer or consumer prices were \nconsidered, but regression analysis found stronger evidence of an inverse association for \nproducer prices than for consumer prices. While the correlation of growth with consumer \nprice de\ufb02ation held only during the Great Depression, signi\ufb01cant growth associations \nwith producer price de\ufb02ation held up for the full sample period, including the postwar \nsubperiod 1947\u20132014. Income grew 1.4 percentage points faster during moderate \nproducer price in\ufb02ation than during producer price de\ufb02ation in 1870\u20132014.\n(cid:31) Restrained investment is one channel by which producer price de\ufb02ation hampers \ngrowth. The producer price index measures price changes from the viewpoint \nof producers and thus affects producer decisions such as on investment. In fact, \nproducer price de\ufb02ation tended to be followed by investment contractions, as 71% \nof economies that experienced signi\ufb01cant de\ufb02ation suffered investment decline. ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xv\nDe\ufb02ation\u00a0can\u00a0compound producers\u2019 debt burdens and thus discourage investment. \nA mix of higher debt and lower prices reduced investment in 45% of economies that \nexperienced both.\n(cid:31) Policy makers should be aware of de\ufb02ation\u2019s potential to harm economic growth. \nLong-run historical comparisons do not rule out the possibility that de\ufb02ation, especially \nproducer price de\ufb02ation, is negatively associated with growth. The data clearly show \nthat high in\ufb02ation as well as de\ufb02ation can adversely affect growth. Because producer \nprices tend to be more volatile than consumer prices, and producer price de\ufb02ation may \ntherefore in\ufb02ict greater damage on the economy, policy makers should monitor not only \nthe consumer price index but also the producer price index. \nOutlook by subregion\n(cid:31) Slowing growth is widespread across developing Asia. Weak recovery in the major \nindustrial economies, moderating growth in the PRC, and recession in the Russian \nFederation are hampering growth in other economies with strong ties to them through \ntrade, investment, and remittances. Meanwhile, sharply lower global commodity prices \nare undermining growth in the region\u2019s oil producers, even as a presumed reciprocal \nboost to growth in oil importers remains elusive. Only Southeast Asia is forecast to see \ngrowth pick up in 2016, however modestly. The expected easing of these impediments to \ngrowth within the forecast horizon points to general improvement in 2017.\n(cid:31) East Asia will see growth drift lower as growth in the PRC moderates further. \nSubregional growth slowed to 6.0% in 2015\u2014a 0.6 percentage point drop from the \nprevious year\u2014as all economies slowed. The rate is expected to decline further to 5.7% \nin 2016. In the PRC, efforts to rein in debt accumulation, adverse short-term effects \nfrom supply-side reform, and emerging labor shortages will tamp down growth from \n6.9% in 2015 to 6.5% this year and 6.3% in 2017. The Republic of Korea will have stable \ngrowth this year, and Taipei,China will accelerate on higher government investment. \nMeanwhile, declines in mining output will push growth in Mongolia below 1%, and lower \ntourism \ufb02ows will slow growth in Hong Kong, China. Although rising domestic demand \nand an improving global economy will lift growth rates slightly higher in 2017 across most \nof the subregion, continued moderation in the PRC will weigh down the subregional \naverage to 5.6% in 2017. In\ufb02ation fell to 1.3% last year with lower prices for oil and other \ncommodities but will rise moderately to 1.6% this year and 2.0% in 2017 as domestic \ndemand rebounds and commodity prices recover. \n(cid:31) South Asia is forecast to post the most rapid growth in developing Asia. Growth in \nthe subregion accelerated to 7.0% in 2015 and will accelerate further to 7.3% in 2017 \nafter a hesitation at 6.9% this year. The subregion\u2019s prospects re\ufb02ect heavy weighting for \nIndia, where growth is expected to dip marginally to 7.4% in 2016 as exports decline and \nboth public and private investment slows, and then pick up to 7.8% in 2017 as investment \nrevives. Apart from weakness in export demand, other economies in the subregion face \nunique challenges to growth: a devastating earthquake and a political standoff in Nepal, \na drop in high-end tourism in the Maldives, and much-needed \ufb01scal reform to deal with \na buildup of excessive debt in Sri Lanka. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan see continued \nmoderate growth bene\ufb01tting from sustained progress toward macroeconomic and \nstructural reform. Subregional in\ufb02ation fell to 5.0% in 2015, bene\ufb01tting from low oil and \ncommodity prices, but is projected to revive to 5.2% in 2016 and 5.7% in 2017. ", "xvi\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n(cid:31) Southeast Asia is seen reversing its growth slowdown in the next 2 years.\nGrowth\u00a0slowed in 7 of the 10 ASEAN economies, edging down the subregional average \nto 4.4% in 2015. In Indonesia, growth moderated for a fourth year in a row. In Malaysia, \nsoft global demand and low oil prices cut growth by a full percentage point. Thailand\u2019s \nrecovery from a slump in 2014 was sluggish, while bad weather hurt agriculture in \nmany economies. In contrast, foreign direct investment in manufacturing and robust \nconstruction propelled Viet Nam to its strongest expansion in 7 years. Aggregate growth \nis forecast to pick up to 4.5% in 2016 and 4.8% in 2017. Infrastructure investment is seen \nboosting growth in Indonesia, while Myanmar rebounds from devastating \ufb02oods in 2015. \nMalaysia, on the other hand, faces another year of decelerating growth. Southeast Asia\u2019s \naggregate in\ufb02ation rate eased to 2.7% in 2015 in line with lower food and fuel prices. \nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to edge higher in most economies this year and next, but decelerating \nin\ufb02ation in Indonesia will hold the ASEAN average to 2.6% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2017.\n(cid:31) Central Asia\u2019s growth slowdown is forecast to deepen this year. Plunging petroleum \nprices, recession in the Russian Federation, and weakness in other trading partners took \ntheir toll on Central Asia, where average growth plummeted to 2.9% in 2015 from 5.3% \na year earlier. Forecasts of even lower petroleum prices and continued recession in the \nRussian Federation prompt a projection that average growth in the subregion will slow \nfurther in 2016 to 2.1%, with contraction forecast for Azerbaijan and growth at only \n0.7% for Kazakhstan. Growth is projected to recover somewhat to 2.8% in 2017 on \nthe strength of an improved external outlook and somewhat higher petroleum prices. \nSteep currency depreciation in several economies helped push average in\ufb02ation to \n6.2% in 2015 from 5.7% last year. The lagged in\ufb02ation effects of depreciation in 2015 \nand possible further currency weakness in some economies are projected to propel \naverage in\ufb02ation to 10.8% in 2016 as acceleration occurs in all economies, with in\ufb02ation \nreaching double digits in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. \nExpected\u00a0exchange rate stabilization should help rein in average in\ufb02ation in the subregion \nto 5.9% in 2017.\n(cid:31) The Paci\ufb01c is poised for lower growth as the economy slows in Papua New Guinea. \nGrowth in the Paci\ufb01c held strong at 7.0% in 2015. This was largely attributable to \ndevelopments in Papua New Guinea, the predominant economy in the subregion, \nwhere new lique\ufb01ed natural gas production and exports powered high growth. The\u00a0only \nother economy to achieve high growth was Palau, where tourism drove expansion. \nGDP\u00a0contracted in Nauru because of damage to port facilities and in Vanuatu because \nof a severe cyclone early in the year, while in energy-exporting Timor-Leste growth \nplunged as oil and gas prices fell. Average growth across the subregion is expected to \nfall to 3.8% in 2016 and further to 3.1% in 2017. In Fiji, cyclone damage is dragging \ngrowth down to 2.7% in 2016, but the economy should rebound to 4.5% growth in 2017. \nIn\ufb02ation\u00a0remained steady in 2015 at 3.4%, though Nauru experienced high in\ufb02ation as \nproblems at the port affected trade. In\ufb02ation is expected to rise slightly to 4.5% in 2016 \nand 4.7% in 2017.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xvii\nAsia\u2019s potential growth\nUnderstanding the growth slowdown\n(cid:31)  Growth momentum has \ufb02agged in developing Asia since the global \ufb01nancial crisis. \nFrom an average of 8.3% during 2006\u20132010, GDP growth in the region fell to 5.9% in \n2015. This decline is likely to have repercussions for the region and the rest of the world. \nDeveloping Asia\u2019s success in lifting 1 billion individuals out of poverty during 1990\u20132012 \nhinged on its ability to sustain high rates of economic growth. Moreover, since the region \ncurrently accounts for more than a quarter of world GDP as valued at market exchange \nrates, a persistent slowdown in developing Asia threatens to undermine the fragile \nglobal\u00a0recovery.\n(cid:31)  The right policy response depends on the nature of the region\u2019s slowdown. Is it \na temporary\u2014albeit prolonged\u2014effect of the business cycle? Or are more persistent \nchanges under way? If weaker growth re\ufb02ects slack demand such as softening export \norders or a downturn in private investment, then \ufb01scal or monetary stimulus may be \nneeded for temporary support. But if supply-side factors are at play, and the growth \nmoderation stems from slowing expansion of the region\u2019s productive capacity, then any \nrevival of growth prospects may depend on structural policy reform.\n(cid:31)  Distinguishing temporary from persistent effects depends on gauging \u201cpotential \ngrowth.\u201d Potential growth is the pace at which an economy is deemed able to expand \nwith full employment and stable in\ufb02ation\u2014that is, when it is operating at its productive \ncapacity. The idea of potential growth is not immutable, as it is in\ufb02uenced by the policies \nand institutions that characterize the particular economy.\n\u00bb  Deviations from potential come at the cost of macroeconomic stability. \nOperating above potential stokes in\ufb02ation, while producing below potential generates \nunemployment. Economies tend toward their potential in the long run, making \npotential growth essentially a speed limit on the pace of long-term poverty reduction.\n\u00bb  Structural reform can yield higher potential growth from given resources. \n\u201cFrontier potential growth\u201d is the rate above potential growth that an economy \ncould achieve if global best-practice policies and institutions prevailed. By lowering \nbarriers to efficient labor and capital allocation, an economy can move closer to this \nconceptual maximum while maintaining macroeconomic stability.\n(cid:31)  Falling potential growth explains much of the region\u2019s post-crisis growth slowdown. \nEstimated average potential growth for a sample of 22 Asian economies, which \naccounted for 98% of GDP in developing Asia in 2014, fell by almost 2.0 percentage \npoints from its 2007 peak of 8.4%. Falling potential growth accounts for about 40% of \nthe moderation in actual growth since the global \ufb01nancial crisis.\n\u00bb  Falling potential growth is widespread in the region. When compared with \naverage potential growth in 2000\u20132007, the post-crisis period 2008\u20132014 saw \ndeclines in 14 of the economies sampled, down by 1.1 percentage points in the PRC \nand by 2.1 points in the Republic of Korea. ", "xviii\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\u00bb Yet some economies sustained or improved their potential growth. From the \n2000\u20132007 average, potential growth in 2008\u20132014 picked up in economies as \ndiverse as Indonesia (by 0.9 percentage points), Pakistan (0.9), the Philippines (0.5), \nand Uzbekistan (2.2). Bangladesh, Fiji, and India have maintained pre-crisis potential \ngrowth into the post-crisis period.\n(cid:31) Future gains in living standards and poverty elimination rest on a grasp of potential \ngrowth. Identifying the institutional and policy constraints that keep an economy from \nachieving its frontier potential growth will be critical to counteract the current slowdown. \nKnowing which factors have driven potential growth in the past can guide policy makers\u2019 \nefforts to meet today\u2019s growth challenge.\nDeterminants of potential growth\n(cid:31) Shifting demographics and labor productivity growth determine potential growth. \nPotential growth is the sum of growth in the labor force plus growth in potential labor \nproductivity, or output per worker. Of these two factors, labor productivity growth \naccounted for about 80% of average potential growth from 2000 to 2014 in the \n22\u00a0Asian economies studied. However, demographic changes have had signi\ufb01cant effects \nin some economies. For example, working-age population growth explains about 50% of \npotential growth in Malaysia, 64% in Pakistan, and 47% in Singapore. Empirical\u00a0estimates \nshow that taking 1 percentage point off working-age population growth shaves \n1\u00a0percentage point from potential growth. With demographic changes turning less \nfavorable in most Asian economies, understanding what determines labor productivity \ngrowth is paramount to boosting future potential growth. \n(cid:31) Capital accumulation affects potential growth by lifting labor productivity. \nLow-income economies can grow faster during the transition to their long-run potential \ngrowth rate by upgrading their equipment and infrastructure and by adopting existing \ntechnologies. However, this \u201cadvantage of backwardness\u201d fades over the course of \ndevelopment as economies gain on their more advanced peers and eventually converge. \nEstimates indicate that an additional $1,000 dollars of initial income per capita lowers \npotential growth by 0.3 percentage points.\n(cid:31) A range of productivity-enhancing factors are amenable to policy interventions.\nEstimates show that gains in tertiary education enrollment and trade openness can \nboost potential growth\u2014especially in economies with the most room for improvement. \nIntegrating into international \ufb01nancial markets can be bene\ufb01cial, but the relationship \ndepends on the economy\u2019s regulatory quality. Improvements to a range of institutional \nvariables, which proxy for such things as government effectiveness and labor market \n\ufb02exibility, can also lift potential growth.\n(cid:31) Potential growth depends on a stable macro economy. A volatile gap between actual \ngrowth and potential growth has, with consequent bouts of rising in\ufb02ation or deepening \nunemployment, a signi\ufb01cantly negative effect on potential growth. Reducing\u00a0this volatility \nby 1.0 percentage point is estimated to pay a potential growth dividend of nearly 0.2 \npercentage points. Policies to push actual growth persistently above its potential have \nonly a temporary effect on the economy\u2019s productive capacity.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xix\n(cid:31) Removing obstacles to efficient factor allocation supports economic dynamism. \nAn economy\u2019s frontier potential growth can be realized only when capital and labor are \nallocated to the most productive \ufb01rms. Analysis of over 10,000 \ufb01rms in 13 developing \neconomies in Asia con\ufb01rms that obstacles like judicial bias, unequal access to \ufb01nance, \nexcessive labor regulation, poor electricity supply, and corruption impede the efficient \nallocation of factors across \ufb01rms, which makes them too large or too small, or too labor \nor capital intensive. Reform to remove these obstacles can enhance \ufb01rms\u2019 efficiency, thus \nmoving economies toward their frontier potential growth.\nA \u201cnew normal\u201d for potential growth?\n(cid:31) Potential growth since the global \ufb01nancial crisis differs sharply from before it. \nAfter accounting for changes in the determinants of potential growth, developing Asia\u2019s \naverage potential growth still declined by 2.2 percentage points in 2008\u20132014 from \nits historical trend. Is this a new normal for Asia? It is true that the decline is slightly \nsmaller than the 2.7 percentage point drop in global potential growth. However, without \nstructural reform, potential growth in many countries in the region will slide further due \nto unfavorable demographics, convergence with advanced economies, and spillover from \ngrowth moderation in the PRC.\n(cid:31) The demographic drag on developing Asia\u2019s potential growth will intensify. \nThe\u00a0region previously bene\ufb01ted from a favorable age structure\u2014the so-called \ndemographic dividend\u2014but slowing population growth and aging populations are \nturning this dividend into a burden. The United Nations projects that growth in the \nregion\u2019s working-age population will be lower in 2015\u20132020 than in 2008\u20132014; this \ndemographic effect alone could depress developing Asia\u2019s potential growth by 0.4 \npercentage points. Less favorable demographics span the region, with working-age \npopulation growth forecast higher among the sample economies only in Sri Lanka.\n(cid:31) Developing Asia\u2019s past success has narrowed the gap with the advanced economies. \nThe advantage of backwardness, which allowed developing economies in Asia to grow \nby adopting existing technologies, is fading as they converge in sophistication with the \nadvanced economies. Less scope for playing catch-up with the advanced economies \nwill make some other determinants of potential growth, such as tertiary education and \ntrade, more important to future growth. On the other hand, low- and middle-income \neconomies still have scope to bene\ufb01t from the convergence effect.\n(cid:31) Moderating growth in the PRC is spilling over to other economies. Ripples from \nslower growth in the PRC, one of the largest economies in the world, are spreading \nglobally, and strong trade and investment ties with close neighbors make the regional \nimpact much more pronounced. Empirical analysis controlling for other determinants of \npotential growth shows a 1.0 percentage point decline in the actual growth rate in the \nPRC associated with a 0.2 percentage point reduction in potential growth worldwide \nand a 0.5 point decline in other Asian economies. As the PRC rebalances toward a more \nsustainable, consumption-driven growth model, its pace of expansion is forecast to ease \nfurther. However, if other economies can lift their potential growth, they can counteract \nsome of the effect of PRC growth moderation.", "xx\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\nPolicies to invigorate potential growth\n(cid:31) Policy changes can partly offset the labor squeeze. Measures to increase female \nparticipation rates and extend the working age can boost the share of workers in the \npopulation. Especially for economies facing the most severe demographic changes, \nmore\u00a0\ufb02exible immigration policies may help \ufb01rms that struggle to attract skilled labor.\n(cid:31) The recipe for higher labor productivity has three ingredients. They are a mix of \npublic and private investment, policy and institutional reform, and sound macroeconomic \nmanagement.\n\u00bb Capital investment is crucial to catch up with the advanced economies. High on\nthe list is government investment in infrastructure, an important public good. As the \nneeds are large, governments must \ufb01nd creative \ufb01nancing solutions such as public\u2013\nprivate partnership. To facilitate private investment, policy can incentivize companies \nto purchase new assets by, for example, accelerating depreciation.\n\u00bb Reform can move current potential toward the frontier. Effective policy and \nhigher-quality institutions can shore up Asia\u2019s long-term growth. If, over the next \ndecade, the 22 sampled economies lifted their current scores on productivity-\nenhancing factors enough to close half of the gap to the best possible scores, their \naverage annual potential growth could increase by almost 1.0 percentage point. \nReforms that, for example, rationalize \ufb01nancial and labor markets, render rules that \ngovern access to land more transparent, and improve governance and the business \nenvironment can boost potential growth by making \ufb01rms more dynamic over time.\n\u00bb Sound macroeconomic management is the foundation for growth. Implementing \npolicies that lower the volatility of actual growth with respect to potential growth by \n25% can add 0.1 percentage points to the region\u2019s potential growth. \n(cid:31) The new normal today need not be developing Asia\u2019s future normal. To ensure a \nhealthy future for potential growth, Asia must employ the full range of policy responses \nto augment labor supply, improve labor productivity, enhance institutional quality, and \nmaintain macroeconomic stability.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xxi\nGDP growth rate and inflation, % per year\nGrowth rate of GDP  Inflation \n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nCentral Asia 6.6 5.3 2.9 2.1 2.8 5.8 5.7 6.2 10.8 5.9\nArmenia 3.3 3.5 3.0 2.0 2.3 5.8 3.0 3.7 3.8 4.0\nAzerbaijan 5.8 2.8 1.1 \u20131.0 1.0 2.4 1.4 4.0 12.0 5.2\nGeorgia 3.3 4.6 2.8 2.5 3.5 \u20130.5 3.1 4.0 5.0 4.0\nKazakhstan 6.0 4.3 1.0 0.7 1.0 5.8 6.7 6.6 12.6 4.6\nKyrgyz Republic 10.9 4.0 3.5 1.0 2.0 6.6 7.5 6.5 10.0 8.0\nTajikistan 7.4 6.7 6.0 3.8 4.0 5.0 6.1 5.1 8.5 7.5\nTurkmenistan 10.2 10.3 6.5 6.5 7.0 6.8 6.0 6.0 6.6 6.0\nUzbekistan 8.0 8.1 8.0 6.9 7.3 11.2 8.4 9.0 10.0 11.0\nEast Asia 6.8 6.6 6.0 5.7 5.6 2.4 1.9 1.3 1.6 2.0\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of 7.7 7.3 6.9 6.5 6.3 2.6 2.0 1.4 1.7 2.0\nHong Kong, China 3.1 2.6 2.4 2.1 2.2 4.4 4.4 3.0 2.5 2.7\nKorea, Rep. of 2.9 3.3 2.6 2.6 2.8 1.3 1.3 0.7 1.4 2.0\nMongolia 11.6 7.9 2.3 0.1 0.5 9.9 12.8 6.6 3.0 7.0\nTaipei,China 2.2 3.9 0.7 1.6 1.8 0.8 1.2 \u20130.3 0.7 1.2\nSouth Asia 6.2 6.7 7.0 6.9 7.3 9.3 6.8 5.0 5.2 5.7\nAfghanistan 3.7 1.3 1.5 2.0 3.0 7.4 4.6 \u20131.5 3.0 3.5\nBangladesh 6.0 6.1 6.6 6.7 6.9 6.8 7.3 6.4 6.2 6.5\nBhutan 3.6 3.8 5.9 6.4 6.1 8.8 9.6 6.6 4.0 5.0\nIndia 6.6 7.2 7.6 7.4 7.8 9.8 6.7 5.0 5.4 5.8\nMaldives 4.7 6.5 1.5 3.5 3.9 2.3 2.1 1.0 1.2 1.4\nNepal 3.8 5.1 3.0 1.5 4.8 9.8 9.1 7.2 10.5 8.2\nPakistan 3.7 4.0 4.2 4.5 4.8 7.4 8.6 4.5 3.2 4.5\nSri Lanka 3.4 4.9 4.8 5.3 5.8 6.9 3.2 3.8 4.5 5.0\nSoutheast Asia 5.0 4.5 4.4 4.5 4.8 4.2 4.1 2.7 2.6 2.9\nBrunei Darussalam \u20132.1 \u20132.3 \u20131.1 1.0 2.5 0.4 \u20130.2 \u20130.4 0.2 0.4\nCambodia 7.4 7.1 7.0 7.0 7.1 3.0 3.9 1.2 2.5 3.0\nIndonesia 5.6 5.0 4.8 5.2 5.5 6.4 6.4 6.4 4.5 4.2\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Heightened risk aversion may trigger in turn large and volatile \ncapital \ufb02ow reversals from emerging markets. Global \ufb01nancial markets \nhave shown a great deal of volatility since the beginning of the year. \nAlthough the US Federal Reserve has refrained from further interest \nrate hikes since December 2015, chances are that further rate hikes will \ncome this year.

The decline in the contributions to growth  Click here for \ufb01gure data\nfrom industry and investment is under way, but the rise in \ncontributions from services and consumption growth has not yet fully \noffset the decline. Third, a natural process of convergence predicts \nthat growth will slow as per capita income rises and as return on \ninvestment diminishes. The PRC has converged quickly in the past \nquarter century, with real GDP per capita rising ninefold since 1990. \nAs labor costs have soared, the PRC has lost some of its attraction as a \nbase for low-cost manufacturing. Wage\u00a0costs are now almost four times \nhigher than in Bangladesh, Cambodia, the\u00a0Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, and Myanmar. \nCyclical factors play a role in growth moderation. External demand \nhas been weaker than expected because recovery in the advanced \neconomies has been lackluster following the global \ufb01nancial crisis \nof 2008\u20132009, and more recently emerging markets have faltered. \nThese\u00a0developments have dragged on PRC exports.", "Rescuing growth in uncertain times\u2002\u200217\nEfforts to maintain high growth after the global \ufb01nancial crisis \nexacerbated imbalances.

Theory and evidence\nThe traditional view is that de\ufb02ation is a danger to be avoided at \nall\u00a0costs (e.g., Fisher 1933, Friedman and Schwartz 1963). De\ufb02ation \nmakes domestic currency debts that are not indexed to prices, which in \npractice means most domestic currency debts, more difficult to service \nand repay. These difficulties create in turn balance sheet problems \nand losses for creditors, especially banks and other institutional \ninvestors. As debtors tighten their belts to avoid costly default, \n\ufb01rms\u00a0curtail investment projects, and households limit their spending. \nThe\u00a0expectation of falling prices tempts even \ufb01nancially healthy \ufb01rms \nand households to delay investment and consumption in anticipation of \nstill lower prices in the future. For all these reasons, de\ufb02ation threatens \nto persist and gather momentum from the moment it emerges. \nHowever, prices can decline not just because of negative demand \nshocks but also because of positive supply shocks. Indeed, benign \npositive supply shock was the dominant explanation for producer price \nde\ufb02ation in the PRC for as long as that economy was growing strongly. \nEmpirical estimates in Borio et al. (2015) support the benign view. \nLooking at the association between the consumer price index (CPI) \nand the rate of GDP growth per capita since 1870 in a wide range of \neconomies, the study found few signi\ufb01cant differences in the rate of \nGDP growth between periods of in\ufb02ation and de\ufb02ation, the notable \nexception being the decade of the Great Depression starting in 1929, \nwhen both output and prices collapsed. The implication is that \nresearchers have inappropriately generalized the experience of an \nexceptional period when de\ufb02ation was extremely rapid and persistent to \nother circumstances where it is not applicable.\nBut the CPI may be less relevant to the decision making and \nbehavior of producers than is the producer price index (PPI). \nBy\u00a0de\ufb01nition, the CPI measures price changes from the vantage of the \nbuyer, while the PPI measures them from the vantage of the seller. \nThis\u00a0distinction may cause the two price indexes to behave differently. \nSeller and purchaser prices will differ because of government subsidies, \nsales and excise taxes, and distribution costs. Insofar as taxes, subsidies, \nand perhaps also distribution costs are slow to change, consumer prices \nmay exhibit less volatility and more persistence than producer prices. \nChanges in international commodity prices also seem to affect producer \nprices and consumer prices differently, with a greater rate of pass-\nthrough to producers (Box 1.3.1).\nIf one is interested in the impact of de\ufb02ation on production \ndecisions, it makes sense to focus on producer prices. If one is interested \nin spending decisions, it makes sense to consider consumer prices and \nproducer prices in combination, because, while consumer prices are the \nmost relevant to the spending decisions of households, both are relevant \nto the spending decisions of \ufb01rms. It is therefore worthwhile to revisit \nthe association between de\ufb02ation and economic growth using producer \nprices rather than consumer prices to see if the benign supply-shock \nview still holds.", "Rescuing growth in uncertain times\u2002\u200223\n1.3.1\u2002Higher commodity price pass-through for producer prices \nIt is widely believed that the recent weakness in global oil  of a 1% drop in global oil prices after 4 quarters reached \nand food prices helped contain inflationary pressures in  14\u00a0basis points for producer prices but only 3 basis points for \nAsian countries.

Persistent de\ufb02ation was thus \nmore damaging for investment.\nDebts are an additional concern. Fisher (1933) pioneered the \nargument that debt and de\ufb02ation were the major causes of economic \ndepressions. De\ufb02ation raises the real value of debt, forcing debt \nliquidation that generates pessimism that feeds back into more de\ufb02ation. \nThe vicious spiral of de\ufb02ation and debt liquidation may suppress \ninvestment, output, trade, and employment. \nIntroducing changes in the ratio of debt to GDP into the analysis, \nHan and Wei (forthcoming) found that investments were signi\ufb01cantly \naffected by the joint effect of de\ufb02ation and debt. The mix of higher debt \nand de\ufb02ation reduced investment in 45% of the economies. The current \nwave of PPI de\ufb02ation may depress or postpone investment, all the more \nso if debts also rise. Therefore, some grounds exist for concern over \neconomies facing de\ufb02ation and rising debt. \nConcluding observations on de\ufb02ation\nThe analysis suggests that policy makers in developing Asia should \nbe aware of the potential harm to economic growth from de\ufb02ation. \nLong-run historical data show de\ufb02ation being negatively associated \nwith economic growth.

Interestingly, there \nare more episodes of persistent de\ufb02ation, including since the middle \nof the 20th century, when viewed using the PPI rather than the CPI. ", "28\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\nFurther, producer prices tend to be more volatile than consumer prices. \nThe present analysis shows that changes in the PPI are signi\ufb01cantly and \ninversely related to growth, in both the full sample period 1870\u20132014 \nand the postwar period 1947\u20132014. Controlling for asset price booms \nand busts does not alter the conclusions about the potential dangers of \nde\ufb02ation.\nFinally, it is important to acknowledge that high in\ufb02ation as well \nas de\ufb02ation can have negative impact on economic growth, as this \nresult comes through clearly in the data. In fact, in\ufb02ation was the \nmuch larger concern in developing Asia until the recent emergence of \nde\ufb02ation, mostly producer price de\ufb02ation, in some regional economies. \nThe\u00a0evidence, while far from de\ufb01nitive, suggests that it would be \nprudent for the region\u2019s monetary authorities to keep an eye on de\ufb02ation \nas well as in\ufb02ation, and on producer prices as well as consumer prices. \nEmpirical analysis of the de\ufb02ation\u2013growth nexus is a relatively new \nline of inquiry.

The right \npolicy response depends on the nature of the region\u2019s slowdown. Is it a \ntemporary\u2014albeit prolonged\u2014effect of the business cycle? Or are more \npersistent changes under way? If weaker growth re\ufb02ects slack demand \nsuch as softening export orders or a downturn in private investment, \nthen \ufb01scal or monetary stimulus may be needed for temporary support. \nBut if supply-side factors are at play, and growth moderation stems from \nslowing expansion of the region\u2019s productive capacity, then any revival \nof growth prospects may depend on structural policy reform. \nThe concepts of potential GDP and potential growth, which \nare grounded in a view of an economy\u2019s productive capacity under \nconditions of stable in\ufb02ation and full employment, can be used to \ndistinguish temporary deviations from the underlying trend in actual \nGDP growth. This chapter provides the theoretical foundation for \npotential growth, develops a simple framework to estimate it from \nreadily available macroeconomic indicators, and applies the framework \nto a sample of developing economies in Asia. \nConceptualizing potential growth\nStandard economic theory assumes that transitory shocks to the actual \ngrowth rate do not signi\ufb01cantly affect the dynamics of the underlying \ntrend or the potential growth rate. Several studies have recently \nchallenged this view, however, and have proposed arguments and \nprovided empirical evidence that support the hypothesis that there \nis a signi\ufb01cant relationship between the short-run cyclical behavior \nof economic growth and long-term performance (e.g., Stiglitz 1993, \nCerra and Saxena 2008). This suggests that the GFC may indeed have \na signi\ufb01cant impact on the future growth trajectory of individual \neconomies.\nThe possibility of a permanent downward shift affects prospects \nfor sustained increases in output. This is an important medium-term \nconcern for policy makers, particularly in less developed countries \nwhere intense pressure exists to deliver sustained increases in living \nstandards. Rodrik (2009), for example, argued that the world after the \n2008\u20132009 crisis would be signi\ufb01cantly different from its pre-crisis \nincarnation, in particular as a milieu for East Asian economies \nthriving as they did in the 20th century. This is because the crisis has \npermanently reduced growth in both productivity and the labor force.1 \nLikewise, Pritchett and Summers (2014) argued that the days of fast \ngrowth in Asia might be numbered because regression to the mean is \nempirically the most robust feature of economic growth. The statistical \nanalysis showed that rapid growth episodes in developing countries are ", "Asia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200245\nfrequently followed by signi\ufb01cant slowdowns. Moreover, the historical \ndistribution of growth has an average of 2% with a standard deviation \nthat is also 2%.\nOne approach to addressing the main issues is to examine the supply \nside of the economy through the concept of potential or natural output \ngrowth. The notion of potential output was initially formulated to \nquantify the ability of an economy to produce output, i.e., its productive \ncapacity. \u201cPotential output\u201d is therefore the highest level of real GDP \nthat can be attained over the long term. By translating levels to growth \nrates, one obtains the rate of growth of potential output. A limit to \noutput growth exists because of technical, natural, and institutional \nconstraints on the ability to produce. \nGrowth theory indicates that in the long run economies tend to grow \nat a rate consistent with the full utilization of productive resources, \ni.e., the natural or potential growth rate. Short-term shocks can induce \ntemporary deviations from potential growth rate, which give rise to \nchanges in unemployment and in\ufb02ation, but over time these changes \nare corrected by price adjustments and growth returns to its potential. \nWhat this means is that the high growth rates enjoyed by Asian \neconomies re\ufb02ected their high potential growth rates. Nevertheless, \nthe\u00a0precise meaning of this term has evolved over time (Box 2.1.1).\nThe approach followed in this chapter is consistent with Harrod\u2019s \nde\ufb01nition of potential growth\u2014the sum of the growth rates of labor \nproductivity and of the labor force\u2014and with Okun\u2019s concept of \npotential output (Harrod 1939, Okun 1962). Hence, potential output \ngrowth is de\ufb01ned as the maximum rate of growth that an economy can \nachieve consistent with macroeconomic stability, in which there are \nneither in\ufb02ationary nor de\ufb02ationary pressures.\nThere is broad agreement that Asia\u2019s spectacular growth in \nrecent decades was enabled by its rapid structural transformation, \ni.e., its\u00a0capacity to shift resources out of agriculture into sectors of \nhigher productivity (ADB 2013). The speed of an economy\u2019s structural \ntransformation depends largely on institutional barriers that affect, \namong other things, the reallocation of factors of production, e.g., \nrestrictive labor laws. Given that these barriers are pervasive in many \nAsian countries and that agriculture is still a large employer (employing \n50% of all workers in India and about 30% in the PRC), Asia\u2019s prospects \nto reengineer high growth will depend largely on eliminating these \nbarriers. Arguably, a signi\ufb01cant share of the high growth registered \nby the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China from the mid-1960s to \nthe mid-1990s, and in the PRC after 1980, is accounted for by the \nweakening of these barriers, which facilitated the absorption of labor \nby the manufacturing and service sectors. But\u00a0most Asian economies \nstill have signi\ufb01cant barriers that prevent the development of modern \nmanufacturing and services. Moreover, there are important obstacles \nthat make it difficult to efficiently reallocate factors across\u00a0\ufb01rms.\nThis leads to the important point that potential growth consistent \nwith stable in\ufb02ation as used in this chapter is\u00a0conditional\u00a0on the \neconomy\u2019s institutions and economic structure. Suppose that one \ncould measure additional growth over and above this potential growth \nthat could be achieved with the removal of all institutional barriers ", "46\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n2.1.1\u2002Evolving notions of potential output growth\nThe idea of potential output has evolved historically.  to maximize employment subject to the constraint that \nThere\u00a0are four main stages in the progression.  inflation should not be excessive.

There \nare various methods to estimate the potential growth rate, which are \nsummarized in Box 2.1.3.\nFrom the methods listed in the box, this chapter uses a multivariate \nestimate that relies on information on GDP growth and in\ufb02ation. This is \nobviously an improvement over the univariate \ufb01lters. Unlike the growth \naccounting approach, it does not require a series of capital stock, which \nis lacking in most Asian economies. And, unlike the output identity \napproach, the method employed in this chapter provides an explicit link \nwith concepts of macroeconomic stability. Before the model is estimated, \nunivariate \ufb01lters are applied to the data series to extract the underlying \ntrends of each variable.\nAs noted above, deviations of actual growth from the potential rate \ncause resources to be either overutilized or underutilized, giving rise \nto changes in the unemployment rate and, consequently, to in\ufb02ationary \nor de\ufb02ationary pressures. Consequently, potential output growth \nis associated with a stable in\ufb02ation environment. The framework \nused in this chapter to estimate the potential growth rate of the \nAsian\u00a0economies builds on this intuition. \nPotential growth as modeled in this chapter is consistent with \nthe Harrod (1939) concept of the natural rate of growth. The natural \nrate of growth is described as both the potential growth rate toward \nwhich the economy tends in the long-run and the short-term upward \nlimit to growth, which turns cyclical expansions into recessions.

Note that when actual growth is \nequal to potential, employment grows at the same rate as the labor force, \nkeeping the unemployment rate constant. As such, when actual growth \nis consistently slower than the natural rate, unemployment will rise, \nand\u00a0vice versa. \nAs a consequence, a convenient method to estimate the natural \ngrowth rate relies on the relationship between unemployment and \noutput growth formalized in Okun\u2019s Law (e.g., Le\u00f3n-Ledesma and \nThirlwall 2002). Such a choice is complicated, however, by the lack \nor unreliability of labor market data for many Asian economies. This \nproblem is addressed by noting that a natural extension of the concept \nof the natural growth rate is the link with the relationship between \nunemployment and in\ufb02ation typi\ufb01ed in the Phillips curve. The process, \nas described in Box 2.1.4, is to estimate the relationship of the gap \nbetween actual and expected in\ufb02ation to the gap between actual growth \nand its natural rate.

The PRC share in  India\nregional GDP increased to almost 55% in 2014 from only \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n25% in 1988. In this context, the surge in regional potential \ngrowth between 1998 and 2007 was mostly the result of the  Hong Kong, China\nphenomenal growth performance by the PRC (Figure\u00a02.1.5). \nTaipei,China\nThe consequence was that the PRC contributed about three-\nSingapore\nquarters of the overall rise in potential output growth during \nthis period.

India\u2019s GDP share and \npotential growth rate also declined, by 2 and 2.3 percentage points, \nrespectively. As a result, its contribution to the aggregate decline was \nalso approximately a third. Meanwhile, the decline in potential growth \nin the PRC was offset by the rise in its regional share of GDP, so that its \nnet contribution to the regional decline was only 0.24 percentage points, \nor 13% of the total.\nThe picture without the PRC (Asia-12) is very similar to that of the \nAsian-13 but, as expected, potential growth without the PRC is lower \nboth before and after the GFC. As with Asia-13, the decline during \n2008\u20132014 was signi\ufb01cant. The substantial decline in Asia-12 average \npotential growth with respect to the earlier part of the 1990s is also \nnoted. Another common feature is that Asia-12 average potential growth \nduring the Asian \ufb01nancial crisis was lower than during the GFC. With \nor without the PRC, the behavior of potential growth clearly shows a \nturning point after the GFC. \nThe question remains whether this slowdown in potential growth \nis a new normal for the region\u2014and what, if anything, policy makers \ncan do to counteract this trend. Future gains in living standards and \npoverty elimination rest on a grasp of potential growth. Identifying \nthe institutional and policy constraints that keep an economy from \nachieving its frontier potential growth will be critical to counteract the \ncurrent slowdown. Knowing which factors have driven potential growth \nin the past can guide policy makers\u2019 efforts to meet today\u2019s growth \nchallenge.", "Asia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200255\nDeterminants of potential\u00a0growth\nSeveral approaches are used to tease out what is behind the recent \nslowdown in potential growth. First, the time-series estimates of \npotential growth for the 22 developing economies in Asia can be \ndecomposed using a set of simple techniques that stem from the \nde\ufb01nitions of the key concepts. From the Harrod (1939) concept of \nthe natural growth rate, potential growth is the sum of labor force \ngrowth and potential labor productivity growth\u2014that is, growth in \npotential output per worker. Potential labor productivity growth itself \ncan be decomposed to show it driven by such factors as within-sector \nproductivity growth, the effect of employment reallocation across \nsectors, capital accumulation, and total factor productivity growth. \nSecond, an econometric model is estimated using cross-country \ndata for a larger sample of countries including those outside of Asia \nto establish the determinants of potential growth. The objective is to \nobtain robust and reliable estimates of variables signi\ufb01cantly correlated \nwith the potential growth rate. \nFinally, \ufb01rm-level data are used to study the role of institutional \nobstacles in generating distortions that cause resource misallocation. \nThis exercise can help shed light on policies that could help shift an \neconomy closer to its frontier potential growth.\nPotential labor productivity growth\nFollowing Harrod\u2019s de\ufb01nition of the natural growth rate, potential labor \nproductivity growth is potential growth less the growth rate of the \nlabor force. Because labor market data in many developing economies \nin Asia are unreliable, working-age population, which is the population \naged 15\u201364, is used as a proxy for the labor force. These data are \ufb01ltered \nusing appropriate statistical techniques to purge short-term variability, \nwhich is caused largely by transitory migration \ufb02ows.\nFigure 2.2.1 shows both potential and actual labor productivity \ngrowth rates for the 12 Asian economies whose potential growth was \ngraphed in the previous section. The PRC displays a high potential \nlabor productivity growth rate\u2014signi\ufb01cantly higher than that of India. \nThis explains a large part of the difference in potential output growth \nbetween these two economies. Consistent with their transition into \nhigh-income economies, the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China show \nmarked declines in potential labor productivity growth. This\u00a0is less \nobvious in Singapore. Actual and potential labor productivity growth \ntend to track each other quite closely in most economies. However, the \nPhilippines is a notable exception, with actual labor productivity growth \nlagging potential for most of the period. \nFigure 2.2.2 reports the breakdown of potential output growth into \npotential labor productivity growth and \ufb01ltered labor force growth \nfor the periods 2000\u20132007 and 2008\u20132013.

First, land reform \nand land-use policies affect the reallocation of labor resources from \nlow- to high-productivity sectors, albeit indirectly. Widespread \nland reform through the fair redistribution of agricultural land \ncan boost agricultural productivity and provide surplus labor that \nmay be reallocated to industry. Agrarian reform can also effect \nincome redistribution that encourages the formation of human \ncapital and increase aggregate demand. The Republic of Korea and \nTaipei,China successfully implemented widespread land reform prior to \nindustrialization, allowing their economies to undergo rapid structural \ntransformation from the 1970s to the 1990s. Other economies in Asia \nattempted to implement land reform but with few tangible results. \nSecond, labor policies that are geared toward protecting labor \nwelfare impose rigidities in nominal wages and introduce barriers to \nlabor reallocation. These regulations provide incentive to substitute \ncapital for labor and can slow down the pace of investment. As such, \nlabor market regulations potentially impede structural transformation \nwhen they are overly rigid. One problem partly responsible for India\u2019s \nslow pace of structural transformation is its rigid labor market as \nstipulated in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.\nA third government failure is migration policy that restricts worker \nmobility. Limiting the mobility of labor directly affects the availability \nof this resource and can create geographic imbalance between the \navailability of quali\ufb01ed workers and demand for them. An example of \na restrictive migration policy is the hukou system of residency permits \nin the PRC, which constrains the free \ufb02ow of labor between urban and \nrural areas and consequently slows the pace of structural transformation.\nLastly, governments inadvertently raise the cost of business by \nimposing product and market regulations. These slow structural \ntransformation through their negative effects on investment and, \nconsequently, \ufb01rms\u2019 scale of operations. While governments often ", "Asia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200261\nimpose labor market and product market regulations to mitigate market \nfailures, the failure of regulatory reform to keep pace with economic \ndevelopment can introduce barriers to structural transformation.\nThe other set of determinants involve market failures such as \ncoordination problems that result from the high cost of collating and \nprocessing information on new products, technologies, and industries, \nand credit market failures. Both of these market failures involve \nexternalities and information asymmetries.\nCoordination problems typically arise when externalities create \nsigni\ufb01cantly large differences between private and social returns. \nIn\u00a0particular, a problem arises when externalities depress private \nreturns. Investment in new technology, for example, is risky, with \nthe \ufb01rst mover typically bearing the brunt of the risk. Meanwhile, \nsuccessful investment invites the entry of other investors and undercuts \nthe \ufb01rst mover\u2019s effective rate of return on the investment. To avoid \nexposure to this risk, the investor may forego the investment unless it \nis possible to prevent or delay the entry of competition, even though \nsociety would view competition as bene\ufb01cial. This state of affairs \ndiscourages investment in new technology and the adoption of new \nproduction processes unless governments intervene. \nCredit market failures often stem from bad choices and moral \nhazards in the allocation of loans. Developing economies typically \nhave underdeveloped \ufb01nancial markets and suffer severe information \nasymmetries. In addition, misguided government policies can force \nthe misallocation of credit, making it difficult to obtain \ufb01nancing \nfor new projects with promise and to scale up operations that have  2.2.1\u2002Economies included in the analysis\nalready proven their worth (Le\u00f3n-Ledesma and Christopoulos 2016). \nDeveloping  Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, \nThe\u00a0resulting low rate of investment and small scale of operations in \nAsia Cambodia, the People\u2019s \nhigh-productivity sectors slows the pace of structural transformation.

It is statistically \nsigni\ufb01cant and at the same time not signi\ufb01cantly different from 1. \nThis\u00a0is\u00a0consistent with the de\ufb01nition of the natural or potential growth \nrate used in this chapter. The results also indicate that working age is a \ngood proxy for the potential growth rate of the labor force.\nThe process of capital accumulation has as its proxy initial income \nper capita. The rationale is that a poor country has a low ratio of \ncapital to labor, which translates into potential to grow quickly. \nThis\u00a0is\u00a0driven primarily by the greater opportunity to accumulate capital. \nThe\u00a0coefficient in the benchmark model implies that an additional \n$1,000 of initial income per capita lowers potential output growth by \n0.33\u00a0percentage points.", "64\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\nUsing the preferred speci\ufb01cation shown in the left column of \nTable\u00a02.2.3, it\u00a0is determined that the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary \neducation and an economy\u2019s openness to international \ufb02ows of goods and \nservices have quadratic effects. This means that the effect of these two \nvariables on potential growth increases but only up to a limit.\nMeanwhile, coefficients on the technology gap and the three proxies \nfor institutional quality are statistically signi\ufb01cant. The positive sign of \nthe technology gap variable is consistent with the observation that the \nadvantage of backwardness dissipates as the gap narrows. The\u00a0possibility \nthat institutional quality may also affect potential growth indirectly is \nalso considered. For example, Kose et al. (2009) suggested that the effect \nof integration on international \ufb01nancial markets may be dependent upon \ninstitutional quality. To explore this possibility, interaction variables \nare speci\ufb01ed involving the technological gap with the US and political \nstability, and \ufb01nancial capital integration and regulatory quality. If the \nimpacts of the technological gap and of the integration index depend on \ninstitutional quality, then the interaction terms should turn out to be \nsigni\ufb01cant. \nThe empirical results show that the gap with the US has a positive \nand signi\ufb01cant impact on potential growth for the entire range of values \nof the index of political stability, and its effect is smaller for countries \nwith greater political stability. A 1 percentage point reduction in the gap \nwith the US raises potential output growth by 0.085 percentage points for \nthe least politically stable countries and 0.055 percentage points for the \nmost politically stable.6 This means that economies that are far from their \nproductivity frontiers and that also have lower political stability can be \nexpected to reap larger bene\ufb01ts from technological spillovers.\nInstitutional quality also affects the impact of \ufb01nancial integration. \nMoreover, the effect becomes higher for small values of regulatory quality, \nwith a maximum of 0.0115 percentage points for countries with the lowest \nregulatory quality.7 This result may seem counterintuitive at \ufb01rst. From \na policy viewpoint, however, it means that \ufb01nancial integration acts as \na substitute for high-quality institutions. For\u00a0emerging economies with \nlow-quality institutions, including some in Asia, the implication is that \nsuccessful integration into international \ufb01nancial markets may bring about \nsigni\ufb01cant long-term growth bene\ufb01ts by raising the potential growth rate.\nIncorporating macro stability\nThe benchmark model is extended by including two variables that capture \nbusiness cycle features. The \ufb01rst is the actual\u2013potential growth gap, the \naverage of the deviation between an economy\u2019s actual growth rate and \nits potential in the previous 5 years. This variable measures the average \ndistance between actual and potential growth rates. A statistically \nsigni\ufb01cant coefficient implies that expansionary or recessionary phases \naffect the potential growth rate.8 The second is growth gap volatility, \nmeasured as the standard deviation of the actual\u2013potential growth gap \nduring the previous 5 years. This variable measures the volatility of actual \ngrowth with respect to the potential growth rate. This captures the \npossible effects of business cycle features, such as growth volatility, on \npotential growth. ", "Asia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200265\nThe coefficient on growth gap volatility is signi\ufb01cant with the \nexpected negative sign. The results suggest that reducing volatility by \n1\u00a0percentage point brings about an increase in potential growth of about \n0.193 percentage points. This outcome is in line with other evidence in \nthe literature (e.g., Ramey and Ramey 1995) and indicates that higher \ngrowth volatility may harm the potential growth rate and, consequently, \nthat demand-management policies aiming to stabilize actual growth \nnear potential growth can bene\ufb01t the economy\u2019s long-term performance.\nPotential growth, misallocation,  \nand institutional obstacles\nThe impact of reducing or eliminating institutional barriers to factor \nmobility is examined in this section. The analysis considers the factors \nthat affect structural transformation. The concept of frontier potential \ngrowth is related to activities and operations at the level of the \ufb01rm \nthat misallocate factors of production. This analysis complements the \nresults on determinants of potential growth, particularly the importance \nof institutional variables. Better institutions facilitate the efficient \nallocation of productive resources, bringing potential growth closer to \nthe frontier and pushing up the frontier itself.\nA further motivation for the \ufb01rm-level analysis is that differences in \nincome per capita across economies are explained mostly by differences \nin productivity (Caselli 2005). According to the recent literature, \ndifferences in productivity and their persistence are attributed in turn \nto resource misallocation (Kalemli-Ozcan and Sorensen 2012). Factors \nof production are said to be misallocated if a different allocation of the \ncurrent aggregate endowment of capital and labor across \ufb01rms would \nincrease the economy\u2019s aggregate productivity.\nMisallocation is generated by obstacles. These create in turn \ndistortions or wedges in the marginal products of capital and labor \nacross \ufb01rms. For example, subsidized credit makes the marginal product \nof capital arti\ufb01cially low for \ufb01rms receiving the subsidy and arti\ufb01cially \nhigh for other \ufb01rms. The result is that subsidized \ufb01rms are more capital \nintensive than they otherwise would be, and unsubsidized \ufb01rms are \nmore labor intensive. The outcome is a misallocation of resources. \nEliminating the credit subsidy and other distortions allows resources to \nbe better allocated, resulting in faster productivity growth.\nSurveys reveal a list of issues that \ufb01rms consider to be important \nfor them: inspection rules, access to credit, corruption, and labor \nregulations, among others. The implication is that an economy\u2019s \npotential rate of growth is not independent of policy. Understanding \nthe role of these obstacles is therefore important from a policy and \ninstitutional perspective. \nTwo types of wedges or distortions on the marginal product of \ncapital and labor across \ufb01rms are calculated by comparing each \ufb01rm\u2019s \nfactor shares of labor and capital with the average of the economy. \nThe measures are explained in more detail in Box 2.2.2. The \ufb01rst is a \nmeasure of output distortion, wherein the marginal products of capital \nand labor increase by the same proportion. An example is inspection ", "66\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\nrules that affect \ufb01rms beyond a certain size. If there are no distortions, \nthe share of labor in total value added is equal across all \ufb01rms. However, \nif a \ufb01rm avoids inspection rules by being smaller than the optimal size, \nit will employ fewer workers and hence the labor share will be smaller \nthan the average. Therefore, the ratio of the \ufb01rm\u2019s labor share to the \naverage of the economy is a useful measure of output distortion.\nThe second is a measure of factor market distortion. These distortions \nalter the use of capital relative to labor, making the ratio different from \nwhat is optimal. As noted above, lack of access to credit reduces \ufb01rms\u2019 \nuse of capital, making them more labor intensive than they would \notherwise be. Note that, if there were no distortions, the ratio of the \nshares of capital and labor would be the same across \ufb01rms. Factor \nmarket distortion is therefore measured by comparing the \ufb01rm\u2019s labor to \ncapital ratio with the average ratio in the economy. \nFirm-level data for 62 developing economies obtained from \nWorld\u00a0Bank Enterprise Surveys data\u2014the Standardized Data for \n2006\u20132014\u2014are used for empirical analysis. This is a strati\ufb01ed survey \nof \ufb01rms that contains \ufb01nancial and business environment information. \nThe\u00a0original data set contains 134 surveys that cover a total of 61,669 \n\ufb01rms. However, the sample is considerably reduced when the data \nare cleaned. Since multiple cross-sectional surveys are available for \nsome economies, only those with the largest number of \ufb01rms are kept, \nsuch that every economy is represented only once. The \ufb01nal sample is \nmade up of 62 economies and a maximum of 21,539 \ufb01rms. Details are \nprovided in Le\u00f3n-Ledesma (2016). The empirical analysis will determine \nto what extent certain obstacles to a \ufb01rm\u2019s operations explain the \ntwo\u00a0distortions.\nSince the distortion is measured as the difference from the country \nmean, the average distortion within an economy is zero by construction. \nTherefore, to see how distortions differ across economies, one needs \nto look at some other aspect of the distribution such as the standard \ndeviation. The standard deviation, a measure of how dispersed the \ndistortion is within an economy, is calculated using the sample of \ufb01rms \nwithin each economy. As shown in Table 2.2.4, the output distortion \nis more dispersed on average than the factor market distortion in the \nfull\u00a0sample of 62 economies and in the subsample of 13 Asian\u00a0ones. Also, \nthe dispersion of both distortions is slightly wider in the Asian\u00a0economies.\n2.2.4\u2002Within-economy dispersion of the misallocation measures\nMean Min Max\nAll 62 economies (21,539 firms)\nOutput distortion 1.6288 0.7257 2.3836\nFactor distortion 1.3958 0.8579 3.0764\n13 Asian economies (10,593 firms)\nOutput distortion 1.7110 1.3639 2.2137\nFactor distortion 1.4966 1.0342 2.1345\nNote: Within-economy dispersion is the standard deviation of the distortion across the sample firms within \neach economy.\nSource: ADB estimates based on data from the Standardized Data 2006\u20132014, World Bank Enterprise Survey.", "Asia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200267\n2.2.2\u2002Distortion measures and misallocation\nMeasures of distortion are derived from the Hsieh and  indicates that if \uf074 = 0, i.e., if there is no misallocation, all \ny,i \nKlenow (2009) theoretical framework.

Are there differences between the \ufb01rms that declare \nthese obstacles to be major or severe and those that declare them only \nmoderate or minor? To answer these questions, the empirical strategy \nsummarized in Box 2.2.2 is carried out.\nRegression coefficients of the obstacle dummy variables, together \nwith their 95% con\ufb01dence intervals, are plotted for each of the \n15\u00a0obstacles in Figures 2.2.7 and 2.2.8.

The econometric results in the previous section show that \na smaller technological gap relative to the US will reduce potential \ngrowth. The so-called advantage of backwardness, which allowed \ndeveloping economies in Asia to grow by adopting existing technologies, \nis fading as they converge in sophistication with the advanced \neconomies. With less scope for playing catch-up with the advanced \neconomies, growth in many Asian economies will depend more on some \nother determinants of potential growth, such as tertiary education and \ntrade. On the other hand, low- and middle-income economies still have \nscope to bene\ufb01t from the convergence effect.\nSpillover from PRC growth moderation\nActual growth in the PRC is forecast to moderate further, from 6.9% in \n2015 to 6.5% in 2016 and 6.3% the year after. The trend is an adjustment \nto several important structural changes, notably the end of the stage \nin development during which less productive labor can be drawn from \nrural areas into more productive manufacturing. This kept wages \ndown in the past and helped the PRC attract considerable foreign \ndirect investment, but now wages have begun to rise. A legacy of past \npopulation policies is particularly unfavorable demographics, as the \nbene\ufb01ts from a relatively youthful population turn rapidly into a burden \nas the population ages. Moreover, the economy is shifting its growth \nmodel from a heavy reliance on investment to one in which consumption \nis the primary driver.\nAs Asia\u2019s largest economy, and the second largest in the world, \nthe PRC exerts a signi\ufb01cant role as an engine of global growth, \nso concerns about slowdown in the PRC are certainly warranted. \nHowever, whether the consequences of the slowdown persist for years \nor decades will depend critically on its relationship with potential \noutput growth and, in particular, with productivity growth in other \neconomies. It is thus important to understand whether natural rates \nof growth in other Asian economies move signi\ufb01cantly in tandem with \nthe PRC. Theoretically, there are several possible channels that can \nunderpin such a relationship. Trade relations with the PRC could foster \nproductivity-enhancing structural change in other economies, accelerate \ntechnological transfer, and foster competition-driven efficiency gains, \nfor example. Change could also re\ufb02ect the global demand effects. \nThe benchmark model is augmented to test whether actual growth \nin the PRC has an effect on potential growth in the global sample.

In the previous section, the effect of demographics \non potential output growth was calculated (Table 2.3.2). The effects of \nthe other determinants are assessed by way of a simulation that uses the \nestimates of the determinants of potential output growth reported in the \ntwo models in Table 2.2.2. \nFuture potential growth: a simulation\nThis section builds on the intuition that, for most of the determinants of \npotential growth that were found to be signi\ufb01cant, it is possible to de\ufb01ne a \nfrontier value\u2014that is, a particular value for which the impact on potential \ngrowth is maximized or, as in the case of the technological gap, has been \ncompletely exhausted.12 Building on this and a number of additional \nassumptions, a scenario for a 10-year period is considered over which the \neffects of the assumed changes in the determinants of potential growth are \nevaluated. Speci\ufb01cally, for each one of the relevant variables included in the \nexercise, the frontier values and speci\ufb01c assumptions are as follows:\nInitial income per capita.

The frontier value is a ratio of 51%, i.e., \nthe threshold beyond which any additional increase in the share of \npopulation with tertiary education has a negative effect on potential \ngrowth. \nLabor market rigidity.

The frontier value is 443%, beyond which the effects of \ntrade on potential growth become negative. It is assumed that the \nvalue of the trade ratio increases by 25 percentage points over 10\u00a0years.\nIntegration index. Because of the interaction with regulatory quality, \nthe frontier value of the integration index cannot be uniquely de\ufb01ned. \nIt is assumed that the value of the \ufb01nancial integration index increases \nby 25 percentage points over 10 years. ", "Asia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200277\nBased on these assumptions and de\ufb01nitions, the simulation is \nconducted as follows:\n1.  For each variable the difference between the latest available value \nand the respective frontier value as de\ufb01ned above is calculated, and \nthe distance from the frontier (DfF) is calculated.\n2.  It is assumed that countries close half of the DfF for each variable \nover a 10-year period.\n3.  For the tertiary enrollment ratio, labor market rigidity, voice and \naccountability, government effectiveness, and the trade ratio, \nthe impact on potential growth is constructed as the product of \nthe respective values of half of the DfF times the corresponding \ncoefficients in the benchmark model (Table 2.2.2). For the tertiary \nenrollment ratio and the trade ratio, nonlinearities are taken into \naccount by setting to zero the potential gain if the economy has \nalready achieved the frontier value.\n4.  As mentioned above, it is assumed that the gap with the US remains \nconstant for the 10-year period, so its impact in the simulation is set \nat zero.\n5.  For the trade ratio and the integration index, the assumption is \na 25% increase over the initial value. The impact of this change \non potential growth is calculated using the relevant coefficient \nestimates from the benchmark model (Table 2.2.2), holding constant \nthe regulatory quality indicator for the integration index and taking \ninto account nonlinearities in the case of trade.\nTwo additional channels are considered, through which  2.4.1\u2002 Simulated future contributions to potential growth, \npolicy intervention can affect the potential growth rate.  percentage points\nThe \ufb01rst is the possible effects of policies to counteract  Item Contribution\nthe slowdown in working-age population growth, such  Demographics \u20130.33\nas postponing retirement age and relaxing immigration \nReform \u20020.98\nrestrictions.

In the short to medium term, measures to increase female \nparticipation in the workforce and to postpone retirement age can be \neffective as well.\nSince the long-term growth rate of the labor force is largely \ndetermined by demographic factors, the focus of policy interventions \nto increase potential growth should be on productivity enhancement. \nIndeed, the evidence presented in this chapter indicates that whether \nthe projected decline in potential growth actually materializes \nhinges not alone on working-age population growth, but also on \nthe implementation of effective economic policies and institutional \ntransformation, as well as on changes to other determinants of potential \ngrowth that affect potential labor productivity growth. \nThe estimates of the determinants of potential output growth \nindicate that closing the technological gap with respect to the US, \nboosting the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education up to \nabout 51%, raising labor market \ufb02exibility, strengthening voice and \naccountability and government effectiveness, opening up to trade ", "Asia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200279\nto about 443% of GDP, and advancing \ufb01nancial integration into the \nworld economy can raise potential growth. These are fundamental \npillars of a successful growth strategy. Naturally, larger improvements \nin these factors will support more substantial positive effects, \nso\u00a0the straightforward policy recommendation for Asian economies \nis to focus\u00a0on devising the most efficient and effective measures \nto bring about economic and institutional change that enhances \npotential\u00a0growth. \nAs stated in the \ufb01rst section of this chapter, the estimate of an \neconomy\u2019s potential growth depends\u00a0on its institutions and structure. \nFrontier potential growth was de\ufb01ned as the growth rate that the \neconomy could achieve if all institutional barriers and distortions that \nobstruct\u00a0factor mobility were removed. The analysis indicates that the \nremoval of \ufb01rm-level obstacles that affect \ufb01rm size and the efficient \nallocation of capital and labor can move developing Asia\u2019s economies \ncloser to their frontier potential growth. Particular attention should be \npaid to correcting de\ufb01cient judicial systems, unequal access to \ufb01nance, \nexcessive labor regulation, inadequate education, poor electricity supply, \nand corruption, which can cause distortions within \ufb01rms and in factor \nmarkets. For example, tax system reform that is neutral with respect \nto \ufb01rm size can improve productivity. Deepening the development \nand outreach of the \ufb01nancial system can advance productivity growth \nthrough the efficient allocation of capital. \nDuring the transition to improved allocation, economies will already \nenjoy a higher potential growth rate. Bene\ufb01ts will derive from structural \nreforms to \ufb01nancial and labor markets, policies to improve access to \nland, strengthened governance, an improved business environment, and \nsigni\ufb01cant infrastructure investments to secure basic needs such as \nelectricity and water supply.\nInfrastructure should remain a priority for Asian policy makers. \nAs the needs are large, governments must \ufb01nd creative \ufb01nancing \nsolutions such as public\u2013private partnership. Toward facilitating private \ninvestment, policy can incentivize companies to purchase new assets by, \nfor example, accelerating depreciation.\nLikewise, higher potential and frontier potential growth can be \nachieved by relaxing government policies and addressing market \nimperfections that impede the more efficient allocation of labor, \nespecially where agricultural employment remains above a high 30%: \nAzerbaijan, Bangladesh, the PRC, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, \nSri\u00a0Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\nWhile increasing potential growth might seem to be an objective \nexclusive to economic policy, an appropriate policy mix can be \ndeployed to correct imbalances between actual and potential growth, \nand to avoid them where they threaten to emerge. The\u00a0existence \nof a signi\ufb01cant gap between actual and potential growth, and the \nresulting economic performance that is other than optimal, create \neither in\ufb02ationary pressures or unemployment. Indeed, inappropriate \npolicy interventions may widen gaps or make them more persistent, \nexacerbating the associated problems. Moreover, wider gaps are bound \nto bring about greater growth volatility that, as indicated by empirical \nevidence presented in this chapter, negatively affects potential growth. ", "80\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\nThis\u00a0reinforces the view that effective demand management and \nstabilization policies may have signi\ufb01cant positive effects. \nThe analysis indicates that such measures, and economic policy \nmore generally, can play a growing role in boosting long-term growth \nin developing Asia. As developing Asia continues its convergence with \nthe advanced economies, the advantages of backwardness will fade \nuntil they are \ufb01nally extinguished. The potential for technological \nspillover from economies on the technological frontier will decline as \nthe technology gap narrows, and the demographic dividend will turn \ninto a demographic debt as growth in working-age population slows. \nFor long-term growth to continue in Asia, and for living standards \nto improve at rates similar to the past, effective policy measures and \nimprovements in the quality of institutions will have to compensate \nfor the lost advantages of yesterday. In the aftermath of the global \n\ufb01nancial crisis, developing Asia\u2019s progress toward high-income status \nwill increasingly depend on how fast it can close the gap in policy and \ninstitutions with respect to the advanced economies.\nAsia\u2019s new normal today need not be its future normal. To ensure a \nhealthy future for potential growth, Asia must employ the full range of \npolicy responses to augment labor supply, improve labor productivity, \nand maintain macroeconomic stability.\nEndnotes\n1  A first reason, Rodrik argued, was that industrialization in the style \nof the Republic of Korea seemed to be impossible in today\u2019s world \nbecause technological change was rendering manufacturing more \ncapital and skill intensive. Second, some Asian economies would \nexperience declining labor force growth rates (e.g., the PRC and \nJapan), though others would still enjoy a demographic dividend \n(e.g., India). In the former group, productivity growth would have to \naccelerate to compensate for the shift in demographics (McKinsey \nGlobal Institute 2015). Third, the World Trade Organization has \nbegun to disallow many industrial policies widely used in the past to \npush growth (Felipe 2015), and developed countries would not be as \nwilling in the years ahead to run current account deficits so that the \ndeveloping world could run surpluses. In the Asian context, Lin and \nZhang\u00a0(2015) has argued in reference to the PRC that the GFC would \nnot have long-lasting effects and that the decline in growth was only \ntransitory.\n2  Two versions of the model are available: closed economy and \nopen economy augmented with the ratio of imports to GDP, the \nlatter following Romer (1993). In total, three different versions are \nestimated: (i) actual inflation (equation [6]) and closed economy \nfor the PRC, Fiji, Japan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet\u00a0Nam; \n(ii) adaptive expectations (equation [8]) and open economy \naugmented for Azerbaijan, India, and Taipei,China; and (iii) adaptive \nexpectations (equation [8]) and closed economy for Bangladesh, \nCambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, \nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, ", "Asia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200281\nViet\u00a0Nam, and Hong Kong, China. The model with actual inflation and \nopen economy did not fit any of the economies well. The results shown \nfor Singapore and Thailand are derived from a different model that \nincludes financial factors (Felipe et al. 2015).\n3  This estimate is derived by dividing the percentage point change in \npotential growth by the percentage point change in actual growth for \nthe 22 developing Asian economies, and then taking the average.\n4  It should be noted that the statistical procedure used to generate \na time-varying estimate of potential output growth (the Kalman \nsmoother) updates the complete series every time a new estimate is \nadded\u2014see details in Lanzafame et al. (2016). After adding the PRC \ngrowth rate estimate for 2015, which is 6.9%, the estimates since 2010 \nbecome lower, with a potential growth rate of 7.69% for 2014 (instead \nof 7.91%) and 7.29% for 2015.\n5  India released an updated GDP series that contains very few years, so \nthe old series was used in the model estimates. Adjusting up the\u00a0growth \nrate based on the years where the two series overlap (2012\u20132014) yields \na slightly higher potential growth rate of 6.94% in\u00a02014.\n6  The direct impact of reducing the gap with the US, as indicated by \nthe coefficient of this variable, shows that a country with a gap that \nis narrower by 1 percentage point has potential growth that is slower \nby 0.07 percentage points. However, the gap with the US is also \ninteracted with the index of political stability in the model, and this \ninteraction term needs to be taken into account to fully quantify the \nimpact of the gap on potential growth. Ignoring the effects of all other \nvariables in the model, potential output growth is computed as gn = \n0.07 \u00d7 gap \u2013 0.006 \u00d7 gap \u00d7 political stability. Recall that the index of \npolitical stability ranges from \u20132.5 to 2.5, with higher positive numbers \nindicating greater political stability. The total effect of reducing the \ngap by 1 percentage point is therefore calculated as 0.07 + (0.006 \u00d7 \n2.5) = 0.085 percentage points for the least politically stable and 0.07 \n\u2013 (0.006 \u00d7 2.5) = 0.055 percentage points for the most politically stable \neconomies.\n7  This is calculated as 0.004 + (0.003 \u00d7 2.5) = 0.0115 for the lowest \nregulatory quality. For values of regulatory quality above \u20130.41 the \nimpact is not statistically significant. Note that this is the impact of \nfinancial integration through regulatory quality. The\u00a0direct impact of \nfinancial capital integration is simply given by the\u00a0coefficient of this \nvariable (0.004), which means that countries with financial integration \n1 percentage point higher will have potential growth higher by \n0.004\u00a0percentage points.\n8  This is approach is similar to that of Le\u00f3n-Ledesma and Thirlwall \n(2002).\n9  Regressions for the Asian economies alone (not shown for reasons of \nspace) are less reliable since the sample size is significantly smaller. \nNevertheless, the Asian dummy for the 2008\u20132014 structural break is \nalways negative, with values that oscillate between \u20132.0 and \u20132.3.\n10  This is the difference between the average growth rate of the actual \nworking-age population growth rate in 2008\u20132014 and the projected \ngrowth rate for 2015\u20132020. This weighted average is computed using \npopulation shares as weights.", "82\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n11  The spillover model for the subpanel of Asian economies is \nestimated as well, but the results are not as reliable because the \nsample size is small.\n12  The methodology and terminology employed in this section are akin \nto those used by the World Bank in its Distance to Frontier exercise  \n(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/distance-to-frontier).\n13  This is a plausible assumption for the purposes of this simulation. \nObviously, it cannot be assumed for the longer term, over which \nmany Asian economies should continue to enjoy the so-called \nadvantage of backwardness.\n14  This means that coefficients from two different regressions are \nbeing\u00a0used. Even if all coefficients from the macro stability model \nwere used, results would be very similar.\n15  This is the reduction in the region\u2019s potential output growth \nsolely due to a lower projected trend growth rate in working-age \npopulation growth during 2015\u20132020, and assuming that countries \nimplement measures (e.g., increase fertility rates, increase females \nlabor participation, etc.) to reduce the negative impact of declining \nworking-age population growth rates by 50%. It is computed using \nindividual countries\u2019 trend growth rates of working-age population \n(not actual growth rates as in endnote\u00a010), weighted by their \nrespective GDP shares.\nReferences\nADB. 2013.

Depreciation has greatly \nincreased the tenge value of private external debt, which totaled \n$8.6 billion for banks and $54.2 billion for other private \ufb01rms at the \nend of September 2015. In addition, re\ufb01nancing has become difficult. \nPossibilities for foreign re\ufb01nancing suffered from a downgrade in the \ncountry\u2019s sovereign credit rating to BBB\u2013, the lowest investment grade. \nMoreover, a 17% central bank policy rate and shallow interbank and \nbond markets make domestic re\ufb01nancing very costly. As a result, there \nhas been no new lending in real terms. Loans as a percentage of GDP \nhardly changed during 2014 and 2015 (Figure 3.4.9). To provide \ufb01nance \nto small and medium-sized enterprises, the consolidated pension fund ", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia  Kazakhstan\u2002\u2002105\nstarted making loans at concessional rates as part of a T600 billion \ninjection into banks and national companies to stimulate retail lending. \nThe government and the central bank have taken some steps to \naddress these problems. The government helped reduce NPLs by \nintroducing the prudential requirement that NPLs cannot exceed 10% \nof all loans, legal amendments to facilitate writing off NPLs, and special \npurpose vehicles to shift NPLs from bank balance sheets to the central \nbank. In 2015, the capital adequacy ratio was raised slightly. All banks \nmust now measure credit risk by external ratings, while market risk and \noperational risks are assigned by set formulas. \nBeyond these measures, the \ufb01nancial system requires considerable \nsupport. To provide it, the central bank needs credibility, autonomy, \nand the resources to \ufb01ll this role, especially as high dollarization \nhinders its ability to serve as a lender of last resort in foreign currency. \nAs of 1 January 2016, four of the country\u2019s 35 banks failed to comply \nwith central bank prudential requirements.

Recent interest rate cuts \nhave reduced \ufb01nancing costs, loan-loss reserves are still twice as high \nas the official nonperforming loan total, and banks are well capitalized \nand further strengthening their capital base by issuing shares and \nsubordinated loans. In addition, safeguarding \ufb01nancial stability is a key \nmotivation for the government\u2019s policy favoring a managed slowdown in \neconomic\u00a0growth.\nPolicy challenge\u2014trimming excess property \ninventory and industrial capacity\nSince the Central Economic Work Conference in December 2015, the \ngovernment has stressed the need to accelerate \u201csupply-side reform.\u201d \nThis emphasis is not new. Reform in the PRC over the past 35 years has \nbeen mostly about supply-side reform, or how to use existing human \nand physical resources more efficiently by reforming prices, company \nownership, and the \ufb01nancial sector while opening up to trade and \nforeign investment, streamlining the role of the government in the \neconomy, and strengthening markets. The reform agenda outlined in \nNovember 2013 consists mainly of structural reform aiming to increase \nproductivity and ensure that high growth over the long term propels the \nPRC toward high-income status. Reemphasizing supply-side reform now \nhighlights the government\u2019s policy that, although targeted demand-side \nsupport through monetary and \ufb01scal policy will continue, structural \nreform will remain the priority going forward.\nTwo key supply-side reforms among several identi\ufb01ed by the \ngovernment are reducing the housing overhang to reenergize the \nreal estate sector and alleviating excess capacity in manufacturing. \nStrengthening local government \ufb01nances is a precondition for success \nin\u00a0both areas.\nThe way to move the property inventory is to generate demand \nfor housing by deepening land reform in rural areas and liberalizing \nthe household registration (hukou) system. Rural land reform, which \naims to facilitate land sales to give rural residents the seed money \nthey need to successfully establish themselves in cities, should be \naccelerated even though some pilot projects reportedly met local \nresistance. The\u00a0government\u2019s plan to expand low-rent public housing \nprograms could bene\ufb01t some migrant workers, but implementing hukou ", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia  People\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002131\nreform would be more effective. If provided with full urban resident \nrights through hukou reform, and with better access to credit, many \nof the 274 million rural migrants currently in urban areas could take \nup unsold properties. The government\u2019s urbanization plan foresees \n100\u00a0million more migrants permanently settling in urban areas. For\u00a0this \nurbanization program to succeed, migrants must have full access to \npublic services in cities, which requires stronger local government \n\ufb01nances. Another challenge is to ensure that the migrants are trained \nappropriately for urban jobs. \nMany companies with excess capacity, most of them state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs), use outmoded technology to generate meager pro\ufb01ts, \nif not losses, and are deeply in debt. Because these companies are \ninherently inefficient, supporting them through stimulus programs to \nraise demand for their products has aggravated problems rather than \nsolved them. However, reducing excess capacity by closing enterprises \nfaces several challenges, including widespread layoffs and related \nincreases of social spending, falling tax revenues, and loan losses. \nADB estimates that reducing excess capacity in iron and steel, \ncoal mining, cement, shipbuilding, aluminum, and \ufb02at glass by 20% \nmight eliminate 3.6 million jobs, or 0.7% of total nonfarm employment. \nThese\u00a0losses would be concentrated in cities and regions that specialize \nin mining and metal production. Concerned about how closing \nsuch \ufb01rms could derail near-term growth, social stability, and local \ngovernment \ufb01nances, the government has set less ambitious targets to \nreduce production capacity for steel by 10%\u201315% and for coal by 10% \nwithin 3\u20135 years.\nMany local governments are already struggling as revenues from \nland sales shrink and debt for infrastructure and social housing \nconstruction grows, leaving them dependent on taxes paid by state-\nowned enterprises. Closing these enterprises might squeeze local \ngovernments\u2019 revenues further while forcing them to spend more on \nsocial security. The central government has promised to help pay for \nsocial bene\ufb01ts and the retraining of laid-off workers, and intends to \nestablish a special fund for this purpose, among other measures. \nAs most state-owned enterprises with excess capacity depend \nheavily on bank lending and have high ratios of debt to assets \n(estimated\u00a0at 68% in the coal sector in 2015), forcing them into \nbankruptcy threatens banks\u2019 balance sheets with more nonperforming \nloans. This\u00a0is one reason why the government encourages mergers \nrather than bankruptcy\u00a0to meet the challenge of excess capacity. \nThe\u00a0merger process must be well managed to ensure that the merged \nenterprises run efficiently and are not burdened by unsustainable debt. \nThe government should also make it easier for banks to acknowledge \nand write off nonperforming loans. For instance, it should rescind \nthe policy of requiring a lower credit allocation to a region, city, \nand industry if a single industry or state-owned enterprise in it \nincurs excessive bad debt, as this policy penalizes enterprises that \nperform well. This\u00a0would reduce local authorities\u2019 resistance to \nclosing hopelessly indebted and inefficient enterprises, improve credit \nallocation, and support the development of well\u00a0performing enterprises \nin their jurisdiction.", "Hong Kong, China\nGrowth slowed to 2.4% in 2015, but inflation eased and the current account and fiscal position \nwere healthy.

Studies that have disaggregated growth into supply-side \ncomponents suggest that the contributions of productivity gains and \ncapital accumulation have slipped.\nChallenges that impede growth in Pakistan include weak \ninfrastructure and transport connectivity and inadequate workforce  3.20.13\u2002GDP growth\nskills, governance and institutions, service delivery, and access to \ufb01nance. \n %\nLimited public resources constrain investment in infrastructure \n12\nfor energy, transport, irrigation, and urban services.

Policies to alleviate these constraints would help improve \nthe business climate, raise domestic savings and investment, boost \ncompetitiveness and exports, and improve public service delivery, \nthereby boosting productivity and growth. \nThe government is currently implementing a structural reform \nprogram to relieve constraints on growth by improving service delivery \nin energy and other infrastructure sectors, expanding \ufb01scal space, \nfostering a competitive business environment, liberalizing trade, and \nrestructuring or privatizing public enterprises. \nEconomic reform and an improving security environment should \nfurther boost business con\ufb01dence and foster private investment. \nOngoing reforms to address the power de\ufb01cit, which is the greatest \nimpediment to manufacturing and growth, have shown progress. \nImproved governance in the energy sector has reduced power outages \nfor industry, improved tariff revenue recovery, and curtailed line losses. \nInitiatives to monitor the performance of power distribution companies \nand to introduce multiyear tariffs aim to improve efficiency and \nstrengthen the regulatory environment. \nWith power tariffs gradually moving toward market-based \npricing, power sector subsidies are contained, thus leaving funds for \ninfrastructure spending.

Too often, masterplans are idealized visions of \nfuture cities that do not take into account the real needs of households, \nbusinesses, or local governments.\nSecond is the funding of urban infrastructure.

For some economies, data for \n2015 are estimated from the latest available information. Projections \nfor 2016 and 2017 are generally ADB estimates made on the bases of \navailable quarterly or monthly data, though some projections are from \ngovernments.\nMost economies report by calendar year. The following record their \ngovernment \ufb01nance data by \ufb01scal year: Armenia; Azerbaijan; Brunei \nDarussalam; the Cook Islands; Hong Kong, China; Kazakhstan; the \nKyrgyz Republic; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR); \nSamoa; Singapore; Taipei,China; Tajikistan; Thailand; and Uzbekistan. \nThe Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, the Republic of Marshall \nIslands, and Palau report government \ufb01nance and balance-of-payments \ndata by \ufb01scal year. South Asian countries (except for the Maldives \nand Sri\u00a0Lanka), Myanmar, Samoa, and Tonga report all variables by \n\ufb01scal\u00a0year.\nRegional and subregional averages or totals are provided for seven \ntables (A1, A2, A6, A11, A12, A13, and A14). For tables A1, A2, A6, and \nA14, the averages are computed using weights derived from gross \nnational income (GNI) in current US dollars following the World Bank \nAtlas method. The GNI data for 2011\u20132014 were obtained from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators online. Weights for 2014 \nwere carried over through 2017. The GNI data for the Cook\u00a0Islands \nwere estimated using the Atlas conversion factor. Myanmar and \nNauru have no GNI data. For tables A11 and A12, the regional and ", "Statistical appendix\u2002\u2002273\nsubregional averages were computed on the basis of a consistent sum, \nwhich\u00a0means that if there are missing country data for a given year, the \nsum of the prior year used for computing the growth rate excludes the \ncorresponding country data. Data for Myanmar and Nauru are excluded \nfrom the computation of all subregional averages and totals.\nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. These tables show related data on \noutput growth, production, and demand. Changes to the national income \naccounts series for some countries have been made to accommodate \na change in source, methodology, and/or base year. The series for \nAfghanistan, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan re\ufb02ect \ufb01scal year \ndata, rather than calendar year data, while those for Timor-Leste re\ufb02ect \nthe GDP excluding oil and United Nations inputs.\nTable A1: Growth rate of GDP (% per year). The table shows annual \ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, \nor basic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of the value \nadded of all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes \nless subsidies on imports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar \ntaxes. Constant factor cost measures differ from market price measures \nin that they exclude taxes on production and include subsidies. Basic \nprice valuation is the factor cost plus some taxes on production, such\u00a0as \nproperty and payroll taxes, and less some subsidies, such as labor-\nrelated subsidies but not product-related subsidies. Most economies \nuse constant market price valuation. Fiji, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka use \nconstant factor costs, while the Maldives and Nepal use basic prices. \nThe series for Taipei,China has been changed to accommodate its \nadoption of the chain-linking method.\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is de\ufb01ned as \nGDP at constant prices divided by the population. The series for most of \nthe Paci\ufb01c countries were revised to accommodate a change of source \nfor population data. Data on per capita gross national income in US \ndollar terms (Atlas method) for 2014 are also shown, sourced from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators online.\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (% per year). \nThe table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture at \nconstant prices and its corresponding share in 2014 at current prices. \nThe agriculture sector comprises agricultural crops, livestock, poultry, \n\ufb01sheries, and forestry. \nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year). The \ntable provides the growth rates of value added in industry at constant \nprices and its corresponding share in 2014 at current prices. This sector \ncomprises manufacturing, mining and quarrying, construction, and \nutilities. \nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (% per year). \nThe table gives the growth rates of value added in services at \nconstant prices and its corresponding share in 2014 at current prices. \nSubsectors generally include trade, banking, \ufb01nance, real estate, public \nadministration, and other services.\nTable A6: In\ufb02ation (% per year). Data on in\ufb02ation rates represent \nperiod averages. The in\ufb02ation rates presented are based on consumer \nprice indexes. The consumer price indexes of the following economies ", "274\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\nare for a given city or group of consumers only: Afghanistan is for \nKabul (until 2011), Cambodia is for Phnom Penh, the Marshall Islands \nis for Majuro, Solomon Islands is for Honiara, and Nepal is for urban \nconsumers.\nTable A7: Growth in money supply (% per year). This table tracks \nthe annual percentage change in the end-of-period supply of broad \nmoney as represented by M2 for most countries. M2 is de\ufb01ned as the \nsum of M1 and quasi-money, where M1 denotes currency in circulation \nplus demand deposits, and quasi-money consists of time and savings \ndeposits including foreign currency deposits.\nTables A8, A9, and A10: Government \ufb01nance. These tables give \nthe revenue and expenditure transactions and the \ufb01scal balance of \nthe central government expressed as a percentage of GDP in nominal \nterms. For Cambodia (since 2006), the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Tajikistan, \ntransactions are those reported by the general government.\nTable A8: Central government revenues (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment revenues comprise all nonrepayable receipts, both current \nand capital, plus grants. These amounts are computed as a percentage \nof GDP at current prices. For the Republic of Korea, revenues exclude \nsocial security contributions. For Singapore, revenues include the net \ninvestment returns contribution. For Kazakhstan, revenues include \ntransfers from the national fund. Grants are excluded in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand; revenues from \ndisinvestment are included for India; and only current revenues are \nincluded for Bangladesh.\nTable A9: Central government expenditures (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment expenditures comprise all nonrepayable payments to \nboth current and capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts \nare computed as a share of GDP at current prices. For Thailand, \nexpenditures refer to budgetary expenditures excluding externally \n\ufb01nanced expenditures and corresponding borrowing. Those for \nTajikistan include externally \ufb01nanced public investment programs. \nOne-time expenditures are excluded for Pakistan.\nTable A10: Fiscal balance of central government (% of GDP). Fiscal \nbalance is the difference between central government revenues and \nexpenditures. The difference is also computed as a share of GDP at \ncurrent prices. Data variations may arise from statistical discrepancies, \ne.g., balancing items for both central and local governments, and from \ndifferences in the concept used in the individual computations of \nrevenues and expenditures as compared with the calculation of the \n\ufb01scal balance. For Fiji, the \ufb01scal balance excludes total loan repayments. \nFor Thailand, the \ufb01scal balance is a cash balance composed of the \nbudgetary and nonbudgetary balances. Some off-budget accounts are \nincluded in the computation of the \ufb01scal balance for Turkmenistan.\nTables A11, A12, A13, and A14: Balance of payments. These tables \nshow selected international economic transactions of countries as \nrecorded in the balance of payments. These items cover annual \ufb02ows.\nTables A11 and A12: Growth rates of merchandise exports and \nimports (% per year). These tables show the annual growth rates of \nexports and imports of goods. Data are in million US dollars, primarily ", "Statistical appendix\u2002\u2002275\nobtained from the balance-of-payments accounts of each economy. \nExports are reported free on board. Import data are reported free on \nboard, except for the following economies, which value them on the \nbasis of cost, insurance, and freight: Afghanistan; Bhutan; Cambodia; \nHong Kong, China; India; the Lao PDR; Myanmar; the Philippines; \nSamoa; Singapore; Solomon Islands; and Thailand. \nTable A13: Trade balance ($ million). The trade balance is the \ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. \nFigures in this table are based on the exports and imports amounts used \nto generate tables A11 and A12. \nTable A14: Current account balance (% of GDP). The current \naccount balance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, \nnet trade in services and factor income, and net transfers. The values \nreported are divided by GDP at current prices in US dollars. In the case \nof Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, official transfers are excluded \nfrom the current account balance. \nTable A15: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average). \nAnnual average exchange rates are quoted as the local currencies per \nUS\u00a0dollar.\nTable A16: Gross international reserves ($ million). Gross \ninternational reserves are de\ufb01ned as the US dollar value of holdings of \nforeign exchange, special drawing rights, reserve position in the IMF, \nand gold at the end of a given period. For the Marshall Islands and \nTaipei,China, this heading refers to foreign exchange reserves only. In \nsome economies, the rubric is foreign assets and reserves of national \nmonetary authorities and national oil funds, i.e., foreign assets of the \nMaldives Monetary Authority, net foreign reserves of the State Bank \nof Pakistan, assets of the National Oil Fund of Azerbaijan, and official \nexternal assets of Kiribati. The data for India are as of 6 February 2015.\nTable A17: External debt outstanding ($ million). For most \neconomies, external debt outstanding, public and private, includes \nmedium- and long-term debt, short-term debt, and IMF credit. For \nCambodia, and the Lao PDR, only public external debt is reported. \nFor Azerbaijan, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand, the \ufb01gures for 2015 are \nas of the end of September.\nTable A18: Debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and services). \nThis table generally presents the total debt service payments of each \neconomy, which comprise principal repayments (excluding on short-\nterm debt) and interest payments on outstanding external debt, as a \npercentage of exports of goods and services. For Cambodia and the \nLao PDR, debt service refers to external public debt only. For Papua \nNew Guinea, Samoa, and Viet Nam, exports of goods are used as \nthe denominator in the calculation of the ratio; for the Philippines, \nexports of goods, services, and income are used as the denominator. \nFor\u00a0Bangladesh, the ratio represents debt service payments on \nmedium- and long-term loans as a percentage of exports of goods, \nnonfactor services, and workers\u2019 remittances; and for Azerbaijan, the \nratio represents public and publicly guaranteed external debt service \npayments as a percentage of exports of goods and nonfactor services.", "276\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\nTable A1\u2002Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nCentral Asia 6.8 5.6 6.6 5.3 2.9 2.1 2.8\nArmenia 4.7 7.2 3.3 3.5 3.0 2.0 2.3\nAzerbaijan 0.1 2.2 5.8 2.8 1.1 \u20131.0 1.0\nGeorgia 7.2 6.4 3.3 4.6 2.8 2.5 3.5\nKazakhstan 7.5 5.0 6.0 4.3 1.0 0.7 1.0\nKyrgyz Republic 6.0 \u20130.1 10.9 4.0 3.5 1.0 2.0\nTajikistan 7.4 7.5 7.4 6.7 6.0 3.8 4.0\nTurkmenistan 14.7 11.1 10.2 10.3 6.5 6.5 7.0\nUzbekistan 8.3 8.2 8.0 8.1 8.0 6.9 7.3\nEast Asia 8.3 6.6 6.8 6.6 6.0 5.7 5.6\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of 9.5 7.7 7.7 7.3 6.9 6.5 6.3\nHong Kong, China 4.8 1.7 3.1 2.6 2.4 2.1 2.2\nKorea, Rep. of 3.7 2.3 2.9 3.3 2.6 2.6 2.8\nMongolia 17.3 12.3 11.6 7.9 2.3 0.1 0.5\nTaipei,China 3.8 2.1 2.2 3.9 0.7 1.6 1.8\nSouth Asia 6.3 5.6 6.2 6.7 7.0 6.9 7.3\nAfghanistan 7.2 11.9 3.7 1.3 1.5 2.0 3.0\nBangladesh 6.5 6.5 6.0 6.1 6.6 6.7 6.9\nBhutan 9.7 6.4 3.6 3.8 5.9 6.4 6.1\nIndia 6.6 5.6 6.6 7.2 7.6 7.4 7.8\nMaldives 8.7 2.5 4.7 6.5 1.5 3.5 3.9\nNepal 3.8 4.6 3.8 5.1 3.0 1.5 4.8\nPakistan 3.6 3.8 3.7 4.0 4.2 4.5 4.8\nSri Lanka 8.4 9.1 3.4 4.9 4.8 5.3 5.8\nSoutheast Asia 4.8 5.9 5.0 4.5 4.4 4.5 4.8\nBrunei Darussalam 3.7 0.9 \u20132.1 \u20132.3 \u20131.1 1.0 2.5\nCambodia 7.1 7.3 7.4 7.1 7.0 7.0 7.1\nIndonesia 6.2 6.0 5.6 5.0 4.8 5.2 5.5\nLao People\u2019s Dem.
