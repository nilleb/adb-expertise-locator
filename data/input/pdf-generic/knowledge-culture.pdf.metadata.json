One thing is sure: in the 21st century, a vital source \nof competitive advantage in successful organizations is their culture, a distinctly human product. So, what is it?\nOrganizational culture comprises the assumptions, values and beliefs, behaviors, artifacts, and measurements \nand actions of an organization, shaped by social learning, that control the way individuals and groups in the \norganization interact with one another and with parties outside it. Prosaically, personnel usually explain \norganizational culture as the way things are done in an organization\u2014what goes and what does not. Even \nshorter writ might read \u201cknow how.\u201d4 (To state the obvious, organizations have subcultures,5 which much as the \noverarching philosophy may not be well articulated and communicated.)\nA standard typology refers to communal, networked, \nmercenary,  and  fragmented  cultures.6  Nevertheless,  the  If we are to achieve a richer culture, rich in \nindispensable notion to grasp is that organizational culture  contrasting values, we must recognize the \nis determined by sundry factors that find expression in  whole gamut of human potentialities, and \norganizational  structure,  making  structure  itself  a  chief  so weave a less arbitrary social fabric, one \nculture-bearing mechanism.7 in which each diverse human gift will find a \nThe figure below delineates 10 components that, together,  fitting place.\ninfluence  organizational  culture.

But \njust as none of the 10 components in the figure shapes organizational culture on its own, none can individually \nsupport desired improvements. The art is to synergize organization, people, knowledge, and technology.8\n3  This section draws from ADB. 2009. A Primer on Organizational Culture. Manila.

Yet, the well-known metaphor of organizational silos suggests that \norganizational units\u2014and their management teams\u2014often lack the desire or motivation to coordinate (at worst, even communicate) with \nother entities in the same organization. This evidences the existence of cultures whereby the incentive is to maximize the performance of \nthe silo, not that of the organization; promoting effective cross-functional teams demands that an enabling environment be built for that.\n6  Numerous other typologies exist. One distinguishes coercive, utilitarian, and normative organizations. (To this, others add another dimension, \nnamely, the professional or collegial organization.)

It crafted a long-term strategic framework, 2008\u20132020, \nreferred to as Strategy 2020,14 to serve as ADB\u2019s corporate-wide planning document and give ADB a more \nrelevant and innovative role in shaping the region\u2019s future. Strategy 2020 focuses ADB\u2019s support on three \ndistinct but complementary development agendas: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable \ngrowth, and regional integration.15 Holding that knowledge is a powerful catalyst for propelling development \nforward and enhancing its effects, Strategy 2020 also underlines knowledge solutions as a driver of change, \namong others.16\nADB\u2019s Knowledge Strategy and Approach. The generation and sharing of knowledge have always \nbeen an essential, catalyzing element of ADB\u2019s mandate. In 2001, through its long-term strategic \nframework, 2001\u20132015,17 ADB committed to become a learning institution and a primary source of \ndevelopment knowledge in Asia and the Pacific. In 2004, Knowledge Management in ADB18 signaled \nADB\u2019s intent to become a learning organization. The framework pursues two mutually supportive \noutcomes: (i) increased assimilation of and dissemination by ADB of relevant, high-quality knowledge \nto developing member countries and other stakeholders; and (ii) enhanced learning within ADB.

The unspoken intentions \nwere stirring a desire for knowledge (knowledge pull) and bringing it to bear (knowledge push).\nSharpening the Knowledge Focus in ADB\u2019s Operations. ADB\u2019s unique abilities to generate, \ndisseminate, and apply knowledge are based on three areas of comparative advantage: ADB\u2019s \ncentral position in identifying trends within and across the region; its capacity for interdisciplinary \nand integrated approaches; and its ability to then blend knowledge and insight with large, \nconcessional financing.

The communities of practice keep know-how of a domain alive by sharing what they \nknow, building on that, and adapting knowledge to specific sector and project applications. ADB \nintroduced the concept of communities of practice in 2001, when it planned a reorganization, and \nrefined it in 2005. Actions/outputs were proposed to ensure that communities of practice become \nan integral part of ADB\u2019s business processes; increase the budget of the communities of practice, \nbased on a clear set of objectives, and, most importantly, measurable \u201coutcomes\u201d of improved \nknowledge management; require the communities of practice to more purposefully engage in \nexternal partnerships; and review the role of the knowledge management coordinators in ADB.\n19  ADB. 2009.

Through such \nexternal knowledge networking, ADB can share insights from its development financing practices \nwith external partners and benefit from knowledge generated by others. Significantly, external \nknowledge networking enables ADB to serve one of its core roles as a multilateral development \nbank\u2014to promote learning and innovation for the benefit of developing member countries. \nActions/outputs were proposed to develop criteria for the selection of external knowledge networks \nincluding nonregional institutions, ensure that expected outputs and outcomes are strategically \naligned to the priorities of ADB and its developing member countries, make sure that agreements \nwith knowledge networks spell out the need to conduct proactive dissemination activities in ADB \nand its developing member countries, and consider knowledge partnerships when ADB enters into \nagreements with other institutions.\nFurther Enhancing Staff Learning and Skills Development.

This is also true of ADB staff.\nFirst CoPs. Informal peer groups emerged in ADB in the 1990s but only in 2002 did they find their footing \nin ADB\u2019s organizational structure. That year saw the birth of 19 sector and thematic networks intended \nto promote cross-fertilization of knowledge across departments. However, in the first few years of their \nexistence, the committees and networks were hampered by many factors, which included the following:\n\u2022\t Nonvoluntary membership\u2014departments nominated staff and required them to devote 15% of \ntheir time to the networks.\n\u2022\t Mixed  responsibilities\u2014the  networks  not  only  provided  think-tank  type  services  in  their \nrespective fields but also performed executive functions such as trust fund management.\n\u2022\t Weak committee chairmanship\u2014even though they \nThe community stagnates without the impulse  were not recognized champions in their field, staff were \nof the individual. The impulse dies away  sometimes appointed as committee chairs.\nwithout the sympathy of the community. \u2022\t Inadequate  resourcing\u2014the  networks  were  not \n\u2014William James given adequate budgets and the work of members was \nnot recognized in staff performance reviews.\nIn  2005,  the  recommendations  of  an  independent  panel  commissioned  to  assess  the  effec-\ntiveness  of  ADB\u2019s  reorganization  prompted  a  consolidation  of  the  networks.  Their  num-\nber  was  reduced  to  10,  and  the  term  \u201ccommunity  of  practice\u201d  or  CoP  entered  the  picture.\nReconstituted  CoPs.  The  new  batch  of  CoPs  fared  better.  Membership  became  voluntary, \nchairmanship of committees was based on technical expertise, and their functions focused mainly \non sector and thematic work. Naturally, the 10 CoPs progressed at different speeds, and the more \nsophisticated among them began to feed into debates on sector or thematic directions, offer advice \non staff skills mix and competencies, and conduct activities on knowledge generation and sharing. \nThe CoPs as a group also started receiving an annual budget of $100,000, shared equally among \nthem and spent on strategy review activities, conference participation, and conduct of studies.\nA 2008 review of the CoPs revealed that they had travelled far, but not far enough. Clearer roles \nand responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis ADB\u2019s operations were called for. Interchangeable use of the terms \n\u201ccommittees,\u201d \u201cnetworks,\u201d and \u201cCoPs\u201d had led to considerable confusion about the meaning of \neach. Resources were still meager. Things turned for the better, and at a much faster rate, when the \nempowerment of CoPs was specified as a pillar of the Action Plan for Knowledge Management, 2009\u2013\n2011.\nApproach\nIn July 2009, ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda approved the Action Plan for Knowledge Management, \n2009\u20132011 to ensure that ADB\u2019s knowledge remains of the highest quality and relevance. The action \nplan committed results in four pillars:\n\u2022\t Sharpening the knowledge focus in ADB\u2019s operations\n\u2022\t Empowering the communities of practice\n\u2022\t Strengthening external knowledge partnerships\n\u2022\t Further enhancing staff learning and skills development\n11", "Knowledge \nSolutions\nBox 1 continued\nThe second pillar highlighted CoPs as an instrument to promote knowledge generation and sharing in \nADB. To set a benchmark for the coming years, ADB surveyed the performance of CoPs in 2009. This first \nsurvey revealed that CoPs helped build relationships and benefited daily work. However, they also needed \nto reach out to all members, especially those in ADB\u2019s resident missions and representative offices; align \ntheir work programs with Strategy 2020, ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework; and concretize their roles \nin reviewing country partnership strategies and lending and nonlending products.\nTo address the survey\u2019s recommendations, ADB took steps to boost CoP effectiveness. The main \ninterventions were:\n\u2022  Higher budgets. In 2010, individual CoP budgets rose from about $10,000 to roughly $100,000. \n(They would increase further in 2012.)\n\u2022  Streamlined guidelines for sector and thematic reporting. Detailed guidelines formalized the \nfeedback process of CoPs to inform ADB\u2019s annual Development Effectiveness Review and work \nprogram and budget frameworks.\n\u2022  New peer review guidelines. The guidelines legitimized the CoPs\u2019 participation in the peer \nreview process and enabled country partnership strategies and lending and nonlending products \nto benefit from the operations-based inputs of CoP members.\n\u2022  CoP work in performance reviews. ADB\u2019s staff performance review templates were modified \nto incorporate knowledge work. Beginning 2011, CoPs also have the opportunity to provide \nperformance feedback about a staff as an \u201cinput supervisor.\u201d\n\u2022  CoPs as partners in recruitment. Acknowledging that subject matter experts in CoPs best \nunderstand what skills are needed in their field, ADB has, since mid-2010, arranged for CoP \nchairs, co-chairs, and practice leaders to participate in screening and interviewing prospective \ninternational staff.\nResults\nBetween 2005 and 2011, four more CoPs were established, bringing the total number of ADB-hosted \nCoPs to 14. Over the 2 years of action plan implementation, CoPs demonstrated they have become the \nheart and soul of knowledge generation and sharing in ADB.\nStrengthening  internal  relationships.  Since  late  2009,  the  number  of  collaborative  initiatives \nbetween and among CoPs have been increasing. They include joint knowledge-sharing events and joint \nknowledge products. At year-end gatherings, begun in 2009, CoPs highlight their accomplishments, \nexchange lessons, and explore areas of collaboration. (The year-end gathering of 2011 would have them \nshare lessons learned with one another.)\nBuilding knowledge and expertise. CoPs now help prepare key ADB documents such as the operational \nplans for education, food security, transport, and water. In support, regional sector studies build the \nknowledge and expertise of their members. The CoPs themselves have also taken an active role in \ndeveloping the technical capacity of members by conducting or arranging training courses tailor-made \nfor them.\nExpanding outreach. Outreach to stakeholders has greatly improved with CoP members providing \nadvice on projects managed by their peers. CoPs have also forged stronger links with ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment  partners  and  stakeholders  by  acting \nas technical experts and focal points on key issues. \nA community is like a ship; everyone ought to \nMoreover, they have shared good-practice studies on \nbe prepared to take the helm.\neducation, tool kits for urban transport development, \n\u2014Henrik Ibsen\ne-newsletters and video documentaries on water, and \nother engaging and creative materials.\nThe second survey of CoPs, undertaken in 2011, revealed considerable improvements across the board. \nNaturally, challenges persist. For example, CoPs might need to crystallize their functions better around \nfiltering,  amplifying,  investing  and  providing,  convening,  community  building,  and  learning  and \n12", "Knowledge as Culture\nBox 1 continued\nfacilitating. CoPs can carry out several of these functions simultaneously but there are trade-offs: each \nfunction requires specific capacities, skills, resources, and systems. Overlooking trade-offs can drive CoPs \naway from their original role. Nevertheless, however they develop, CoPs will need ADB\u2019s continued \nsupport; the potential from their activities is just too great. They can more decidedly\n\u2022  Promote innovative approaches to address specific development challenges.\n\u2022  Develop, capture, and transfer good practices on specific topics by stimulating the active \ngeneration and sharing of knowledge.\nWithout a sense of caring, there can be no  \u2022  Link  diverse  groups  of  practitioners  from \nsense of community. different disciplines and be thus intertwined in ADB\u2019s \n\u2014Anthony Burgess organizational structure.\n\u2022  Serve as an ongoing learning venue for staff (and \noutside practitioners) who share similar goals, interests, problems, and approaches.\n\u2022  Respond rapidly to individual inquiries from members and ADB clients, audiences, and partners \nwith specific answers.\nSource: Extracted from ADB. 2011. Empowering ADB-Hosted Communities of Practice. Manila. Available: www.adb.org/publications/\nempowering-adb-hosted-communities-practice \nBox 2: ADB-Hosted Communities of Practice\u2014Driving Knowledge Activities\n\u2022  Communities of practice are a prime tool of organizational development.\n\u2022  Empowering CoPs was one of the four pillars of Enhancing Knowledge Management under Strategy \n2020: Plan of Action, 2009\u20132011.\n\u2022  Since 2009, fast advances in core knowledge activities instituted ADB-hosted communities of practice \nas the heart and soul of knowledge generation and sharing in the organization.\nEmpowering ADB-Hosted Communities of Practice\nAt the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of ADB held in 2009, President Haruhiko Kuroda \nstressed the importance of knowledge to the organization:\u201dTo be fully effective, we must also consciously and \nactively blend knowledge with financing. We will focus on developing, capturing, and sharing knowledge in \nall our work, ensuring that ADB serves an intermediary role for both financing and knowledge.\u201d\nThree months later, President Kuroda approved Enhancing Knowledge Management under Strategy 2020: \nPlan of Action, 2009\u20132011 to advance the knowledge management agenda in ADB. Four pillars framed the \nplan: (i) sharpening the knowledge focus in ADB\u2019s operations, (ii) empowering CoP,a (iii) strengthening \nexternal knowledge partnerships, and (iv) further enhancing staff learning and skills development.\nTacit knowledge,b specifically how to access and share it, offers a particularly complex challenge in pursuing \nany knowledge agenda; it needs special methods to transmit it. Therefore, the second pillar of the action plan \nemphasizes CoPs as a collaboration mechanism to generate and share knowledge.\nCoPs were first introduced in 2002 during an ADB-\nwide reorganization. However, in the years after the \nIt is vain to talk of the interest of the \naction plan was introduced, they have grown swiftly as \ncommunity, without understanding what is \ncenters of expertise.

What \nis more, CoPs empower people in their work: the simple act of joining and being regularly involved in such \norganized groups has significantly impacted individual well-being among ADB personnel.\nDelivering Core Knowledge Activities\nTo excel in their respective domains, ADB-hosted CoPs aim to identify, create, store, share, and use \nknowledge. All these are core knowledge activities that learning organizations align or integrate into business \n13", "Knowledge \nSolutions\nBox 2 continued\nprocesses and balance according to the specificities of each. Since 2009, annual and triennial reports have \nhelped define work programs and report on accomplishments in these areas.\nIdentifying knowledge. Many CoPs now conduct surveys or interviews to help determine the knowledge \nproducts and services their members can create or improve on. Examples include the Water CoP Perceptions \nsurvey and The Philippines Environment and Natural Resources Country Assessment: \u201cA Call to Action.\u201d \nIn 2009, ADB\u2019s Knowledge Management Center also introduced a biennial survey of ADB-hosted CoPs \nto help them assess performance and identify means to reach optimal levels.\nCreating knowledge. Many CoPs have published and produced documentaries to showcase initiatives, \nprograms, and activities. The Water CoP, for instance, has pioneered the Water for All series. The Education \nCoP has launched the Focus on Education series. The Environment CoP helped articulate Asia\u2019s voice in \npreparing for the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development or Rio + 20 through the \nreport Green Growth, Resources, and Resilience.\nStoring knowledge. ADB-hosted CoPs have become ubiquitous, thanks to the myriad means for knowledge \ncapture and storage the digital world now offers. Because perceptions of information overload have less \nto do with quantity than with the quality by which knowledge is presented, many CoPs craft products that \nhighlight achievements and outcomes. The material is stored for ready access through multiple platforms \nincluding the CoP webpages in ADB\u2019s internal and external sites. eStar, an electronic storage and retrieval \nsystem, is now also used to store publications. Some CoPs, such as that for transport, also use YouTube to \nupload video footage.\nSharing knowledge. ADB-hosted CoPs bring a focus to bear on knowledge sharing through peer reviews, \nnotably of country partnership strategies and lending and nonlending operations;c customized in-house and \nexternal training of members; regular meetings, seminars, conferences, and forums;d external knowledge \npartnerships; etc. These activities are not just an add-on; they are becoming integral part of daily work.\nCoPs extensively use information and communication technology in support of knowledge sharing. \nKnowledge databases, discussion boards, blogs, and webpages were developed for this. The focus of \nwebpages such as the Energy CoP\u2019s ENERcall at http://enercall/ and the Urban CoP\u2019s UrbInfo at http://\nurbinfo/ remains internal but the applications are mobile and provide cumulative data and information \nanywhere, anytime.\nA monthly internal e-newsletter dedicated to CoPs, i.prompt.u, was introduced by the Knowledge \nManagement Center in 2011 to expand knowledge sharing within and outside ADB. It serves to aggregate \ninformation from contributors to enhance relationship building and networking. Specifically, i.prompt.u \nhighlights knowledge products, events, and news of CoPs; links to individual newsletterse of CoPs; \nshowcases annual and triennial reports of CoPs; fosters inter-CoP collaboration and cross-fertilization \nthrough rich exchange of information; and advances interest in multiple domains.\nUsing knowledge. ADB-hosted CoPs also draft operational plans in sector and thematic areas to refine \nthe strategic directions that Strategy 2020 laid out. The purpose of the plans is to review experiences \nand past practices, assess broader development issues and challenges, and identify short- to medium-\nterm approaches and activities needed to act on ADB\u2019s strategic thrusts. In 2009, ADB completed an \noperational plan for sustainable food security.

Yet institutions have \nlargely ignored the power of storytelling in favor of official reports, formal speeches, and press \nreleases. In 2008, ADB began to explore storytelling as a medium to capture, store, and share its \npast and present staff\u2019s vast knowledge.\nThe first product, the publication ADB: Reflections and Beyond, was an introspective look at ADB \nover 4 decades of development work, culled from the memories of past and present, senior and \njunior, and local and international staff. Often called the \u201cYellow Book,\u201d this publication is the \nresult of painstaking efforts\u2014conducting over 40 interviews, trawling through the voluminous \nmaterials produced, and transforming the spoken words into written language without losing their \nspontaneity, essence, or appeal.\nReactions to the Yellow Book were overwhelmingly positive. Contrasting sharply with the \ndominant  tone  and  style  of  ADB\u2019s  usual \nproducts, the book adopted an easy-reading  Action and faith enslave thought, both of them \napproach that made ADB\u2019s rich history doubly  in order not be troubled or inconvenienced by \ninteresting. Readers pored over their copies  reflection, criticism, and doubt.\nand asked when the next volume would be  \u2014Henri-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Amiel\nreleased. The next volume, as it turned out, \ncame in a hugely different format.\nConcerned with giving staff a more dynamic walk down \u201cmemory lane,\u201d ADB designed an \ninteractive multimedia documentary, powered by a Flash-based application, that would allow users \nto browse through ADB\u2019s experiences using various entry points, e.g., subjects, years, decades, \nADB presidents, etc. The product, currently nearing completion, is anchored by four timelines: \nthe ADB Sustainable Development Timeline, a World Sustainable Development Timeline, ADB \nhistorical milestones, and a Timeline of ADB-Hosted Communities of Practice. The addition to \nADB\u2019s living archive was launched in December 2011 on the occasion of the organization\u2019s 44th \nanniversary.\n15", "Knowledge \nSolutions\nBox 3: Building Narrative Capacity at ADB\n\u2022  ADB makes growing use of knowledge management tools, methods, and approaches but must better \ncapture and store its wealth of tacit knowledge.\n\u2022  In 2009, the Knowledge Management Center in ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment launched an oral history project to help ADB hear itself.\n\u2022  ADB staff expressed deep appreciation for ADB: Reflections and Beyond and its companion audio \ncomposition, Beyond: Stories and Sounds from ADB\u2019s Region\u2014ADB has developed an appetite for \nstorytelling in various contexts and applications.\nOrigins\nADB has insufficient means of capturing and storing its vast wealth of tacit experience. Coaching and \nmentoring are somewhat ad hoc; exit interviews are still cursory; the Critical Incident technique finds few \napplications; structured peer assists have not yet been introduced; knowledge harvesting is not practiced; \nafter-action reviews and retrospects are more or less unheard of; and only a small number of weblogs \nexists. In short, knowledge sharing is limited to small (but rapidly expanding) communities and networks of \npractice, meetings over coffee, or occasional exchanges in hallways. A particular concern is that senior staff \ndo not often transfer their experience with audiences outside Management circles.\nADB is both a repository of stories waiting to be told and an audience ready to listen. At the 2007 annual \nmeeting of the Knowledge Management for Development community, Olivier Serrat, the future head of \nthe Knowledge Management Center in ADB, learned of a storytelling project of the Islamic Development \nBank conducted in 2006 because many of that organization\u2019s staff were about to retire. Upon joining the \nKnowledge Management Center in September 2008, he formulated an oral history project to create a means \nby which ADB might hear itself and learn from past and present experience. Storytelling would surely \nhelp ADB become a learning organization as envisaged \nIt is not part of a true culture to tame tigers,  in Strategy 2020, ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework.\nany more than it is to make sheep ferocious. In October 2008, the Knowledge Management Center \n\u2014Henry David Thoreau decided to test ADB\u2019s appetite for storytelling. A scoping \nexercise soon confirmed that staff were ready and willing \nto share their experiences with narrative techniques. According to an early participant, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to talk \nabout the future if you ground it in the events of the past.\u201d\nListening to ADB Through Stories\nIn March 2009, long tables covered with blank sheets were laid out in ADB\u2019s Library, inviting staff to \njot down significant memories and mark out ADB\u2019s crossroads over the years. With some difficulty at \nthe start, a timeline of ADB\u2019s history, born of staff reminiscences, emerged. It articulated a healthy blend \nof recollections\u2014some fundamental, others more subtle. It became the basis for the structure of ADB: \nReflections and Beyond. Accordingly, that would intersperse reminiscences of arrivals and early years, \ndescriptions of ADB projects and day-to-day operations, reports of complex situations and tricky judgment \ncalls, etc. with personal memories of colleagues.\nInterviews with alumni, Management, and staff provided the most trying yet fulfilling moments. Storytelling \nwas still new to ADB, even though some had used it in projects. The Knowledge Management Center initially \nidentified over 40 interviewees\u2014a judicious mix of senior and junior international and local staff, alumni, \nand former members of the Board of Directors and Management. \u201cI heard a story about something you did \n15 years ago. Can you tell me more?\u201d Some interviewees declined the invitation to take part. Others said they \ncould only spare 30 minutes but reminisced for more than 2.5 hours. A few were eager to be interviewed but \nhesitated\u2014they felt they were not senior enough. Two quickly said that interviews can preserve institutional \nmemory and requested follow-up sessions.\nThe book ADB: Reflections and Beyond is one of many fruits from the interviews. A companion audio \ncomposition, Beyond: Stories and Sounds from ADB\u2019s Region, selects pearls of wisdom, artistically allied to \n16", "Knowledge as Culture\nBox 3 continued\nsounds captured in headquarters and the field, in the form of podcasts.\nPoring over the material yielded by 33 interviews and making selections for the publication was not easy. But \nthe greater challenge lay in transcribing spoken words into written language without losing vivacity. Dealing \nwith these difficulties occupied the Knowledge Management Center in the second half of 2009.\nADB: Reflections and Beyond was printed in January 2010. But, there was still a sense of uncertainty \nstemming from concerns over how the book should be launched, how staff would react to it, and what \nunintended effects it might have. Eventually, what became known as the \u201cYellow Book\u201d was released on \n2 February 2010, coinciding with ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s town hall presentation of ADB\u2019s Our \nPeople Strategy, a document that sets out the principles for how the organization will recruit, motivate, and \nmanage its workforce to achieve the operational and institutional goals of Strategy 2020. The limited number \nof copies of the book placed on display at the launch were snapped up by staff as they arrived. Every staff \nmember received a copy of the book the following day. ADB: Reflections and Beyond is now given to each \nprospective staff.\nAppreciation and Follow-up Culture is not made up but something that \nReactions to the book were overwhelmingly positive.  evolves which is human.\nDuring the town hall meeting, staff who held advance  \u2014Edward T.

When is the next volume coming out?\u201d\nADB: Reflections and Beyond and Beyond: Stories and Sounds from ADB\u2019s Region succeeded in connecting \nstaff with ADB\u2019s very rich history. They contrast sharply with the authoritative, yet distant voice of traditional \nADB products. The book is refreshingly different, \u201c\u2026 a bit on the light side, which is fine, but future stories \ncan go deeper.\u201d\nThere is something to be said for positive deviance. As is the case for many radical innovation projects, \nstarting small and flying below the radar helped get things done. Once personnel see, recognize, and \nunderstand the benefits of approaches such as storytelling (especially when products begin to take shape), \ndemand for related initiatives typically increases. Other departments are beginning to use the technique for \ntraining purposes. For example, storytelling is being used to develop a source book for country directors.\nAs a postscript, the Knowledge Management Center later asked the interviewees how narrative techniques \nmight be applied elsewhere. One suggested that ADB should consider capturing stories from its audiences, \nclients, and partners. Their feedback might feature people who helped shape the evolution of ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment work across Asia and the Pacific.\nSource: Extracted from ADB. 2010. Building Narrative Capacity at ADB.

Available: www.adb.org/publications/building-narrative-\ncapacity-adb\nBox 4: Interactive Stories of Sustainable Development\n\u2022  In early 2009, ADB embarked on a first organization-wide knowledge-harvesting exercise to collect a \nblend of recollections and reminiscences through storytelling. It gave birth to two much-appreciated \ncontributions that stimulated in-house appetite for use of narrative techniques in various contexts and \napplications.\n\u2022  In late 2010, a follow-up interactive, audiovisual project was conceptualized to promulgate further the \nuse of storytelling to elicit, capture, store, and share knowledge.\n\u2022  The potential of the new multimedia platform to energize staff recruitment, induction, and training; \nadd color to conferences and other events; enrich education; and boost ADB\u2019s profile externally was \nimmediately recognized.\nSetting\nIn March 2009, long tables covered with blank sheets were laid out in ADB\u2019s library, beckoning staff to \n17", "Knowledge \nSolutions\nBox 4 continued\nrecord special memories and mark out ADB\u2019s crossroads over the years. The intention was to (i) draw out \nand package tacit knowledge of struggles and triumphs working for development in the Asia and Pacific \nregion, and ADB\u2019s evolution as an institution, to help others adapt, personalize, and apply it; (ii) preserve \ninstitutional memory; and (iii) build organizational capacity. A blend of staff recollections and reminiscences \nformed and became the basis for the well-regarded publication titled ADB: Reflections and Beyond (also \nreferred to as the \u201cYellow Book\u201d) and its audio companion Beyond: Stories and Sounds from ADB\u2019s Region. \nThe two products marked ADB\u2019s first endeavor at knowledge harvesting through storytelling.

The brochure \nframed a select record of progress by ADB and its \nmember countries across the many dimensions of sustainable development, e.g., social, economic, and \nenvironmental. But it was decided from the onset that the timeline should amount to more than just a sheet \nof paper. In fact, after the success of the preceding knowledge-harvesting exercise, it seemed natural to take \nthings further and represent the timeline in a more versatile medium\u2014an interactive, audiovisual platform \nthat would allow users to browse not just data and information but also, more importantly, evocations of \nevents. In December 2010, the Knowledge Management Center initiated the long and arduous task of \nmorphing the ADB Sustainable Development Timeline brochure multidimensionally.\nApproach\nPlatform. The ADB Sustainable Development Timeline would host an easy-to-access and organic \nrepository of interviews, short documentaries of projects shot on location, sounds (as in Beyond: Stories \nand Sounds from ADB\u2019s Region), B-roll footage, animations, graphics, voice-overs, videos, statistics, \nphoto essays, etc.\nResearch. With the ADB Sustainable Development Timeline brochure setting the compass for content, \nproject staff rummaged through ADB reports and publications from 1966, archived films and stills, online \nresearch material, and sundry other references to scope the context of milestones. By the time research \nand writing had ended, the project\u2019s reach had grown to four timelines: the existing ADB Sustainable \nDevelopment Timeline, and timelines of world events touching sustainable development since 1948, \nhistorical highlights of ADB since its establishment, and ADB-hosted communities of practice from the \n1990s. (The World Sustainable Development Timeline was subsequently published with an eye to Rio + \n20, scheduled on 20\u201322 June 2012.)\nProduction. Some 72 ADB staff\u2014past and present, senior and junior\u2014were invited to an outside setting \nand their experiences of particular events or projects mined and preserved through video. This yielded 11 \nhours and 30 minutes of film, later categorized and tagged in multiple topics. Location shoots inside ADB \npremises\u2014both in headquarters and resident missions\u2014followed. Visits to Indonesia and Viet Nam were \nalso made to interface with beneficiaries and put on view associated landmarks and landscapes. The trips \ndelivered high-quality interviews and footage that made for compelling documentaries.\nKnowledge Organization. The wealth of knowledge generated by the exercise demanded systematic \norganization. Using Adobe Flash Player to house the structure for the product, project staff arranged the \nmaterial by year, theme, region, community of practice, ADB president, and more. The effect is a personal \nexperience: each user can click or scroll through videos, pick a story of interest, and probe content in \nnonlinear fashion.\nChallenges.

Next, staff were \nsometimes noncommittal\u2014this affected scheduling. Then, after transcription and tagging, hours were \nspent sifting through collections to showcase stimulating content.\nWay Forward\nIn December 2011, on the occasion of ADB\u2019s 44th anniversary, the introductory video of the ADB Sustainable \nDevelopment Timeline was shown to ADB staff who enthused about it. A series of longer demonstrations \ntook place soon after, all generating pleased responses. Many saw the potential of the videos, either used \ncollectively or individually, for learning and development, recognizing firsts, safeguarding institutional \nmemory, and a myriad other uses. ADB\u2019s human resources division, for example, suggested that the product \nbe showcased during induction programs for new staff, noting that the storytelling mode eases learning and \nretention of critical knowledge. Some of ADB\u2019s external partners, such as the University of the Philippines in \nLos Ba\u00f1os and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines), were impressed when elements \nof the timeline were presented to them during their field trips to ADB, and wanted to see more. More content \nis being generated to expand the range of the product. Through the briefings, ADB realized that gaps need \nto be filled, such as deeper coverage of subregions, even \ngreater variety in topics, additional inclusion of women  Their story, yours and mine\u2014it\u2019s what we \nand new staff, etc. all carry with us on this trip we take, and we \nConclusion owe it to each other to respect our stories and \nThe  ADB  Sustainable  Development  Timeline  video  learn from them.\nsprang  from  creativity  and  innovation,  method,  and  \u2014William Carlos Williams\nno small amount of work. But collaboration and open-\nmindedness in the organization powered performance. For ADB to have embarked on such an initiative \nproves how much it values the knowledge, experience, and insights of its professionals and wants to share \nthose. Through this, ADB hopes to better shape the future, with respect to the past.\nSource: Extracted from ADB. 2012. Interactive Stories of Sustainable Development. Manila.

Between 2005, when ADB first conducted a MAKE \nsurvey, and 2011 the increase in the number of respondents jumped a cumulative 1,132%, \naveraging 162% annually.26 Without a doubt, more and more ADB staff have become aware of the \norganization\u2019s efforts to improve its knowledge stocks and flows. The highest annual percentage \nincrease, 155%, was recorded in 2009, the year the Action Plan for Knowledge Management, \n2009\u20132011 was approved. Various factors have contributed to this growing engagement, one \nof which is the change in the way ADB testifies on knowledge management initiatives at the \ncorporate level. One concrete example is ADB\u2019s Annual Report, which showcases ADB\u2019s \noperations, projects, internal administration, financial management, special funds, and more. In \n2004, when the knowledge management framework was approved, \u201cknowledge management\u201d \nmerited 350 words in the chapter on institutional effectiveness.

In 2008, a new chapter on sector and thematic highlights \nunderscored quality, knowledge, and innovation for inclusive and sustainable development. \nIn 2009, ADB once again expanded reporting specific to knowledge management: in addition \nto the chapter on generating and sharing knowledge, a new chapter on delivering an effective \norganization carried a section on strengthening learning, which accorded pride of place to \nimplementation of the Action Plan for Knowledge Management, 2009\u20132011. In 2010, three of \nADB\u2019s five regional departments included sections on knowledge management in their respective \nchapters; in 2011, all of them did. Another example is ADB\u2019s Development Effectiveness Review, \nwhich reports annually on ADB\u2019s corporate results framework and, since its introduction in 2008, \nuses the annual MAKE survey assessment rating to help gauge ADB\u2019s operational effectiveness \nin managing knowledge better.

An organization can benefit \nseverally from pursuing a knowledge strategy.27 For ADB, a relative newcomer in the field of \nknowledge management, the bottom line is:\nAffirming Knowledge as a Strategic Asset and Critical Resource. With Asia experiencing \nrapid economic growth over the recent decades, ADB recognizes that financial assistance is not \nalways the primary commodity its developing member countries need. In many ways, ADB\u2019s \nknowledge\u2014which benefits from its strategic position to identify trends within and across the \nregion and capacity for interdisciplinary and integrated approaches\u2014has greater pull and push. \nPursuing a culture-based knowledge strategy has further promoted the view of knowledge as a \nstrategic asset and a critical source of competitive advantage and highlighted its dual nature as both \nan input and output.

See ADB. \n2012. On Internal Knowledge Markets. Manila. Available: www.adb.org/publications/internal-knowledge-markets\n20", "Knowledge as Culture\nSetting Clearer Directions. Over the last 3 years, ADB has developed a habit of asking if it is \nmanaging knowledge better. Now that the Action Plan for Knowledge Management, 2009\u20132011 \nis closed, ADB ought to capture lessons from past successes and shortcomings by raising the \nfollowing questions: What did ADB set out to do? What worked well, and why? Moving forward, \nwhat might ADB do differently next time, and how?\nLearnings? An organization\u2019s culture\u2014not forgetting its subcultures\u2014determines assumptions about \nwhat knowledge is, hence, what stocks and flows of that may be worth managing. It arbitrates the \nrelationships between individuals, teams, and communities; sets the context for social interaction; \nand shapes the processes whereby knowledge is identified, created, stored, shared, and used. No two \norganizations are similar and there are disquieting limits to what learnings can be vulgarized for the \nbenefit of others. If knowledge is the combination of information and human context, there is no easy \nway from the earth to the stars. \u201cAn intelligent hell would be better than a stupid paradise,\u201d declared \nVictor Hugo. Yet, practitioners must have their take-aways. Pending an after-action review of the \nAction Plan for Knowledge Management, 2009\u20132011, some \nThe learning and knowledge that we have, is,  easy and not-so-easy lessons might be:\nat the most, but little compared with that of  Fostering  and  Sustaining  a  Culture  of  Knowledge \nwhich we are ignorant.

To innovate \nknowledge management and learning holistically, individuals, teams, and communities must \nbe heartened to continually ask, learn, and share. In ADB, the current popularity and perceived \nvalue of communities of practice should not be taken for granted. Of course, communities work \nbest if they are clear about domain, values, membership, norms and rules, structure and process, \nresources, flow of energy, and results. But, if too much informality can kill a community so can too \nmuch attention from Management to what is, in the final analysis, a voluntary way of organizing. \nOne cannot force people to collaborate and a chicken does not get fatter the more you weigh it. \nManagement must learn to cultivate these fertile organizational forms without destroying them; \nafter all, since members select themselves, communities of practice only last for as long as there \nis interest in joining and maintaining the group. Equally, it should be recognized that action plans, \neven when they provide impetus, are by nature dysfunctional: an organization that professes \nto become a knowledge organization should not rely on temporary expedients: knowledge \nmanagement must be part and parcel of everyday occupation in a culture of knowledge.\nRecognizing Different Learning Styles. Personnel\u2014in ADB\u2019s case, international staff and \nnational and administrative staff\u2014develop knowledge management capabilities at different rates. \nIt is important that ADB should draw knowledge management initiatives that meet the distinct \nneeds of personnel streams as the MAKE surveys continue to explain.\nLeveraging  Off  Strengths.  The  2010  Learning  for  Change  survey  undertaken  by ADB \nrevealed that of the four learning subsystems \nof  organization,  people,  knowledge,  and  Culture is the widening of the mind and of the \ntechnology,  ADB  staff  feel  most  satisfied  spirit.\nwith technology.
