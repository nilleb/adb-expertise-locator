After controlling for firm and individual characteristics as well as country \nand  sector  dummies,  participation  in  international  trade  plays  a  significant  role  in \nexplaining this growth, boosting firm-level growth by 3% per year on average. The fact \nthat firms start exporting quickly after their foundation suggests that reverse causality is \nnot an issue for our estimates. However, biases arising from unobserved heterogeneity \ncannot  be  ruled  out.  Therefore,  we  exploit  the  fact  that  firms  were  exposed  to \nunexpected variation in real exchange rates between 2005 and 2008 to investigate the \ncausal  relationship  between  trade  and  employment  growth.  The  results  are  not \nconclusive,  but  they  do  not  suggest  that  the  relationship  is  driven  by  unobserved \nheterogeneity.   \n \n \nKeywords:  MSE graduation, trade, employment growth \n \nJEL Classification: O12, D22 ", "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises  |  1 \n \n1.  Introduction \n \nThe motivation for this paper stems from the importance of micro- and small enterprises \n(MSEs) as a source of employment in developing countries. Firms with six workers or \nfewer account for roughly 50% of all employment in Latin America and substantially \nmore than half in Africa and Southeast Asia, with their most significant contributions \nbeing made in urban areas (Fajnzylber et al. 2006). \n \nFurthermore, it has been observed empirically that despite the severe constraints faced \nby  MSEs  in  developing  countries,  a  significant  number  of  them  have  managed  to \nexpand, indicating that they do have potential to drive economic growth. However, based \non the characteristics of these successful firms there appears to be a significant number \nof firms that have, so far, failed to realize their growth potential (Grimm et al. 2012). \nHelping MSEs to grow is desirable not only to provide employment, but also to provide \nbetter employment. Wages in small enterprises tend to be low and it is usually difficult \nfor owners to provide workers with social security benefits unless the firm can graduate \ninto a bigger and more efficient firm.1 In this context, it is important to understand what \nconstraints prevent firms from realizing their growth potential. Lack of access to credit \nhas been acknowledged by numerous authors as a fundamental constraint to business \nexpansion, especially for MSEs (Dinh et al. 2010; Bigsten et al. 2003). However, there \nare other major constraints receiving less attention that are specific to MSEs, such as \nbusiness risks and a lack of access to markets, inputs, and technology. \n \nThis paper focuses on the role of international trade in employment growth, with a \nspecial focus on MSEs. There are several ways in which participating in international \nmarkets can, in theory, help firms to overcome growth constraints. Exporting is one \nimportant channel to overcome the small size of local markets and low elasticity of \ndemand. Empirical evidence also shows that exporting helps firms to grow and boost \nproductivity through learning effects and the exploitation of economies of scale (van \nBiesebroeck 2005; Fafchamps et al. 2004). Similarly, firms in developing countries may \nbe  constrained  in  input  markets:  many  inputs  are  not  produced  locally  and  most \nequipment is imported from abroad.  \n \nUsing  a  representative  sample  of  manufacturing  firms  in  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, we \nfind that since their foundation firms that started in the lowest quintile of the initial size \ndistribution grew by about 20% annually, compared with about 10% for the average firm. \nAlthough their small initial size reduces their contribution to overall employment creation, \nthey nonetheless account for a substantial 15% of total employment creation in the six \ncountries during the period under review. We also find that after controlling for firm and \nindividual  characteristics  as  well  as  country  and  sector  dummies,  participating  in \ninternational trade boosts employment growth by 3% annually on average. In order to \ncontrol  for  potential  unobserved  heterogeneity,  we  employ  an  instrumental  variable \napproach,  exploiting  the  natural  experiment  created  by  unexpected  variation  in \nexchange rates between 2005 and 2008. Although the results are not conclusive, they \n                                                \n1  In this paper, we measure enterprise growth by the growth in full-time employees since enterprise \nfoundation. \n ", "2  |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 115 \nprovide  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  relationship  between  firm  growth  and \nparticipation in international trade is driven by endogeneity bias. To provide information \nfor policymakers we define top performers as firms in the top quintile of the employment \ngrowth distribution. We find that about one-third of top performing firms started as an \nMSE and that participating in international trade or having an owner with a college \ndegree  increases  the  probability  of  being  a  top  performer  by  about  10%  and  5%, \nrespectively. \n \nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of \nthe recent economic literature on potential constraints faced by enterprises in developing \ncountries and the role of MSEs. Section 3 describes the empirical findings and Section 4 \nconcludes and derives policy implications. \n \n \n2.  Literature Review \n \nEvidence  from  around  the  world  shows  the  importance  of  MSEs  in  generating \nemployment,  especially  in  developing  countries.2  Firms  with  six  workers  or  fewer \naccount for roughly 50% of employment in Latin America and substantially more than \nhalf in Africa and Southeast Asia (Fajnzylber et al. 2006). Fox and Sohnesen (2012) find \nthat small-scale household enterprises generated most new jobs outside agriculture and \nearnings from household enterprises have the same marginal effect on consumption as \nwage and salary employment. Given the magnitude of the MSE sector it is important to \nunderstand whether these enterprises are merely low-productivity, subsistence activities \n(Banerjee and Newman 1993; Lloyd\u2013Ellis and Bernhardt 2000) or have the potential to \ngrow and contribute to employment creation and economic growth (Grimm et al. 2012). \n \n2.1  Empirical Evidence of Heterogeneous MSE Growth Patterns \n \nMcMillan and Woodruff (2002) provide evidence of the potential of newly founded firms, \nmostly  small  firms,  in  transitional  and  developing  economies  such  as  the  Russian \nFederation, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Poland, and Viet Nam. The example of \nViet Nam, in particular, shows the potential of MSEs. Between 1992 and 1995, private \nsector employment in Viet Nam grew by about 2.5 million, almost all of which can be \nattributed to small manufacturing firms and the expansion of household enterprises in \nthe  retail  and  repair  sectors.  In  the  PRC,  newly  founded,  mostly  small  enterprises \ncontributed substantially to the fact that the share of industrial production of rural firms \nrose from 9% in 1978 to 30% in 1991. These two examples in developing countries \ndemonstrate the potential for small firm growth in developing and transitional economies.  \nMead and Liedholm (1998) find that since their foundation MSEs created almost twice as \nmany jobs as formally registered large-scale enterprises in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, \nSwaziland, and Zimbabwe, although overall employment growth in these countries in the \n1990s was slow. The study also finds MSE growth to be heterogeneous. The authors \nshow  that  most  of  the  MSE  growth  can  be  attributed  to  a  minority  of  enterprises, \nalthough even these added only a few workers. They find average annual growth rates \n                                                \n2  MSEs are frequently defined as firms with up to five permanent workers (Nichter and Goldmark 2009; \nLiedholm 2002). ", "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises  |  3 \n \nof MSEs to be between 4% (Swaziland) and 24% (Kenya). Only 27% of all enterprises \ngrew in size over the period under review, creating 0.14 jobs per year on average. The \nstudy also analyzes the income generated by MSEs and finds that returns to labor rise \nsubstantially for enterprises that consist of more than one person. This increase in \nefficiency  is  associated  with  higher  levels  of  income  for  employees  and  enterprise \nowners. \n \nAnother study examines firm growth between 2006 and 2010. Dinh et al. (2010) use \ndata from the World Bank  Enterprise Surveys (WBES) to examine determinants of \naverage annual firm growth. The study uses a cross-sectional data set with almost \n40,000 observations from 98 countries. The findings show that firm growth is highest for \nenterprises  with  fewer  than  10 employees.  Firms  that  had  been  established  in  the \nprevious 5 years grew faster than older firms, and average enterprise growth was lowest \nin East Asia and the Pacific, and highest in South Asia.3 Following the growth diagnostic \napproach  by  Hausman  et  al.  (2005),  the  study  identifies  financial  constraints  and \ninformal sector competition as the most binding constraints to firm growth in developing \ncountries. Though the study mentions firm heterogeneity between and within countries, \nthe analysis does not include empirical results at the country level.  \n \nSleuwagen and Goedhuys (2002) analyze the firm growth process in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire using \na representative sample of manufacturing firms. The empirical results show a negative \nrelationship  between firm growth  and firm  age  and  size  in  C\u00f4te  d\u2019Ivoire.  However, \ncomparing firm growth by enterprise size between C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Germany shows \ndifferences in growth patterns between developed and developing countries. This is an \nextreme example as Germany is well known for its broad base of small and medium-\nsized enterprises, but similar results are also shown for other developed countries.4 \nSmall enterprises grew relatively fast in Germany, as evidenced by the fact that 28% of \nGermany\u2019s large and medium-sized firms (100 or more employees) started as micro \nenterprises (1\u20134 employees). In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, only a few large firms started small but \nlarger enterprises (with more than 50 employees) grew faster than in Germany. The \nfindings are consistent with a \u2015missing middle\u2016\u2019 in the firm size distribution in developing \ncountries.  \n \nTo sum up, the reviewed empirical literature on firm growth in developing countries \nshows that such growth is heterogeneous, particularly for MSEs, which account for the \nmajority of firms in most developing countries. Also in most countries, only a few MSEs \nshow rapid growth. The next section sums up studies on different groups of constraints \nand identifies the research gap on for the role of trade for employment growth in MSEs \nin Southeast Asia. \n \n2.2  What Constraints Impede MSE Growth? \n \nWe assume that the relatively high concentration of MSEs in developing countries and \nthe  heterogeneous  growth  patterns  of  these  firms  can  be  explained  by  certain \n                                                \n3  The other subregional groups are Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the \nCaribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa. \n4  See Stenkula (2006) for an overview of firm size distribution of European countries. \n ", "4  |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 115 \nconstraints these enterprises face. An overview study by Nichter and Goldmark (2009) \nlends support to this hypothesis. The authors review the most influential studies on firm \ngrowth in developing countries over the past 50 years and identify four key factors \nassociated with low growth in developing countries: (i) individual characteristics (e.g., \neducation, gender, or work experience), (ii) firm characteristics (e.g. age, size, access to \nfinance), (iii) relational factors (e.g., value chains or social networks), and (iv) contextual \nfactors (e.g., business environment). \n \n2.2.1  Credit Constraints \n \nOne frequently studied and well-confirmed constraint to enterprise growth is a lack of \naccess to finance due to credit market imperfections. Numerous studies have examined \nthe role of credit constraints in hindering firm expansion (Tybout 1983; Dinh et al. 2010; \nDollar et al. 2005). Bigsten et al. (2003) use firm data from Burundi, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, \nGhana, Kenya, and Zimbabwe and find that even though demand for credit in Africa \nseems small, the success rates in loan applications for bigger firms are substantially \nhigher than success rates for small firms. The findings show that 33% of all firms in the \nsample are credit constrained. However, only 10% of large firms are credit constrained \ncompared with 64% of micro-sized firms.5 \n \nIn addition, there is some evidence that young and small firms are particularly affected \nby capital constraints (Beck et al. 2005; Evans and Jovanovic 1989). Taking together the \nfindings on firm growth and capital constraints, it is reasonable to assume that capital \nconstraints influence firm size distribution. Theoretical and empirical work show that \ncredit  constraints  can  skew  firm  size  distribution  toward  smaller  firms  and  that  the \nskewedness decreases with firm age (Cooley and Quadrini 2001; Dinh et al. 2010; \nAngelini and Generale 2008).  \n \nFinally, the finding of high returns to capital in MSEs in Latin America, Africa, and Asia \nconfirms  the  presence  of  credit  constraints  in  developing  countries  (McKenzie  and \nWoodruff 2006; Udry and Anagol 2006; de Mel et al. 2008). \n \n2.2.2  Risk \n \nAnother important influence on firm growth that is particularly relevant for MSEs is \nbusiness risk. Cash flow, especially for young MSEs in developing countries, can be \nvolatile. Hence, risk-averse entrepreneurs might be reluctant to take the steps necessary \nto start capital accumulation, which in turn may prevent them from investing in new \ntechnologies that can boost efficiency (Binswanger and Rosenzweig 1986). Also, due to \npartially irreversible investments, firms might need a liquidity premium such as a level of \nprecautionary savings deemed comfortable enough for the investment (Fafchamps and \nPender  1997).  As  Fafchamps  (1999)  points  out,  \u2015true  business  risk\u2016  might  be \naccompanied  by  opportunistic  or  contractual  risk  if  no  proper  contract  enforcement \nmechanisms are in place, which is likely to be the case in developing countries. In \nparticular, in a risky environment where contract enforcement is difficult, it is easy to \nclaim the inability to stick to obligations agreed to with a business counterpart. This \n                                                \n5  A credit-constrained firm is defined as a firm that requested a loan but was rejected. ", "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises  |  5 \n \nexample makes it clear that business risk is related to institutional and governance \nconstraints such as contract enforcement. The effect of institutional weaknesses and \ncorruption on firm growth has been quantified by Fisman and Svensson (2007) in the \ncase of Uganda. The study finds that a 1% increase in bribery reduces firm growth by \n3%.6 The empirical evidence of the effects of risk on marginal returns to capital is mixed \nas the expected positive effects cannot be confirmed (McKenzie and Woodruff 2006; de \nMel et al. 2008; Grimm et al. 2011). \n \n2.2.3  Individual Characteristics \n \nBesides credit constraints and risk, individual characteristics of the firm owner have also \nbeen found to influence firm growth. Often these individual characteristics are interlinked \nwith other constraints such as a lack of access to credit. \n \nThe educational attainment of enterprise heads or the entrepreneurial ability of owners \nmay also interact with other constraints to MSE growth. It seems to be the case that a \ncountry-specific  threshold  needs  to  be  reached  before  one  can  observe  a  positive \ncorrelation between educational attainment and firm performance (Nichter and Goldmark \n2009; McKenzie and Woodruff 2006). Also, education may interact with other individual \ncharacteristics such as gender (de Mel et al. 2009). \n \nA recent stream of literature uses randomized experiments to analyze the success of \nMSEs from a gender perspective. The studies show how the impact of interventions, \nwhich aim to reduce barriers to firm growth such as credit constraints, also depends on \nindividual characteristics. These experiments randomly allocate cash or in-kind transfers \nto enterprises and analyze the effects on the firms. Such experiments have been carried \nout in Ghana (Fafchamps et al. 2011), Sri Lanka (de Mel et al. 2009), and the Philippines \n(Karlan and Zinman 2009). The results from Ghana show no effect of randomly allocated \ngrants in enterprises run by women with initial profits below the median. In Sri Lanka, \nmen invest the randomly allocated grants and as a consequence profits rise by up to \n14% of the grant amount. Women, by contrast, only invest large grants but do not earn \nany  return  on  this  investment.  In  the  Philippines,  randomly  allocated  microcredit \nincreases profits only in male-led enterprises, which in turn use the extra money to send \ntheir children to school. The loans have no effect on profits in enterprises led by women. \n \n2.2.4  Access to Markets, Inputs, and Technology \n \nAnother set of constraints to MSE growth originates from demand-side issues, input \nunavailability, and a lack of technology. A small domestic market and, hence, limited \ndomestic demand, potentially combined with low elasticity of demand for the particular \nproducts  commonly  produced  by  MSEs,  may  impede  firms  from  growing  (Lachaud \n1990). Recent empirical evidence confirms the importance of this constraint (B\u00f6hme and \nThiele 2012).  \n \n                                                \n6  The question used to measure bribes was the following: \u2015Many business people have told us that firms \nare often required to make informal payments to public officials to deal with customs, taxes, licenses, \nregulations, services, etc. Can you estimate what a firm in your line of business and of similar size and \ncharacteristics typically pays each year?\u2016 (Fisman and Svensson 2007, p. 68). \n ", "6  |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 115 \nExporting is evidently an instrument to overcome the small size of local markets in \ndeveloping countries (Bigsten et al. 2004; Diao et al. 2006). Empirical evidence from \nAsia and Africa shows that after entering the export market productivity increases occur, \nwhich can be largely attributed to the exploitation of scale economies (van Biesenbroeck \n2005).7  Firms  may  also  be  constrained  by  input  markets  if  certain  inputs  are  not \nproduced locally and most equipment used is imported from abroad.  \n \nIn addition to the traditional pattern of exporting (e.g., from a developing country that has \ncomparative advantage in relatively low-skilled textile manufacturing to a developed \ncountry),  falling  transport  costs  and  reduced  trade  barriers,  as  well  as  rapid \nadvancements in production technology, have made it possible for large international \nfirms  to  \u2015slice  up  the  value  chain\u2016  (Krugman  et  al.  1995).  This  relatively  new \nphenomenon of regional and global production networks means that it can be easier for \nfirms to start exporting since they can specialize in only one small step of the production \nprocess. This new trend is confirmed by the fact that production network trade has \ngenerally grown faster than total world trade in manufacturing (Athukorala 2011). \n \nBenefits  from  participating  in  global  markets  might  also  stem  from  the  increasing \npresence of foreign firms in domestic markets. The evidence on whether the presence of \nforeign  firms  creates  employment  and  boosts  the  success  of  domestic  firms  is \nambiguous. As described by  Markusen and Venables (1999) using the example of \nTaipei,China, it can be the case that foreign firms create additional demand for local \nproducts and services, boosting firm growth. On the other hand, it is argued that foreign \nfirms compete with local firms both for markets and skilled workers, and hence crowd out \nlocal firms (Aitken and Harrison 1999; Backer and Sleuwaegen 2003). In addition to \nemployment effects caused by the presence of foreign firms, there might also be positive \nskill or technology spillover effects.8 However, empirical evidence of these spillover \neffects is mixed (G\u00f6rg and Greenaway 2004). \n \nGiven  the  rapid  growth  of  opportunities  for  participation  in  international  trade  via \nproduction networks, this paper will focus on the effects of engaging in international \ntrade on employment growth in MSEs using data from six Southeast Asian economies. \nThe MSE sector\u2019s importance in Asia is evidenced by the fact that it  accounts for \nsubstantially more than 50% of employment in the region. The constraint of access to \nmarkets, inputs, and technology is particularly relevant for the region as many countries \neither are plugged into, or would like to plug into, regional or global production networks. \nThis  paper  tries  to  fill  the  research  gap  on  the  effects  of  trade  and  investment \nliberalization  on  employment  growth.  In  particular  we  will  examine  the  following \nquestions: \n \n(i)  Can we observe employment growth in MSEs, and if so, do firms that started \nsmall contribute to overall employment growth? \n \n(ii) What role does participating in international trade play in employment growth? \n                                                \n7  See also Wagner (2012) for an overview on empirical studies examining the relationship between \nexporting and productivity. \n8  One possible channel for such spillovers is the skill acquisition channel: foreign firms provide training to \nworkers and workers trained by foreign firms might at one point start working for a local firm. ", "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises  |  7 \n \nWhat  are  the  characteristics  of  firms  that  grew  particularly  fast  and  what  are  the \nimplications for policymakers? \n \n \n3.  Empirical Analysis \n \nFor our empirical analysis we use the World Bank enterprise surveys (WBES) from \nMalaysia and Thailand (2007), and Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Viet Nam \n(2009). The surveys are representative samples of registered manufacturing firms with \nfive or more employees. The surveys in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam also \ninclude firms in the services sector. \n \n3.1  General Enterprise Characteristics \n \nOur sample comprises almost 5,400 firms in six Southeast Asian countries.9 Note that \nthe  employment  growth  rates  and  determinants  of  employment  growth  need  to  be \ninterpreted with caution. Our data set is cross-sectional and therefore it includes only the \nfirms that survived throughout until the date of the survey. Hence, all estimates for \nemployment growth should be interpreted as upper bound figures.10  \n \nEnterprise  growth  is  measured,  for  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  by  the  growth  of \nemployment in firms. Measuring firm growth using other indicators such as profits or \ncapital  is  not  possible  as  these  indicators  are  not  measured  consistently  across \ncountries. \n \nTable  1  summarizes  the  main  characteristics  of  the  enterprises  under  review.  The \nresults show significant employment growth. Firms in our sample started with 64 full-time \nemployees on average and had 114 employees when the surveys were carried out. The \nmedian values of the firms\u2019 initial and current sizes are considerably  lower, with a \nstarting size of 20 employees and a current size of 40 employees. This shows that a \nsmall proportion of firms heavily influence the average numbers. The firms in our sample \nare relatively old: around 16 years on average. The mean and median values of firm age \nare similar and do not vary substantially across countries. \n \nThe orientation toward international markets is somewhat limited: about three-quarters of \nthe output is sold domestically. The data allow us to further distinguish between direct \nand indirect exports. Directly exporting is the preferred mode, on average only 5% of \noverall  output  is  exported  indirectly  through  an  intermediary,  while  about  20%  is \nexported directly. Thailand and Malaysia show the highest share of production being \nexported with an average of 27% and 34%, respectively. We define firms that import \ninputs and also export as participants in international trade. Using this definition, about \n21% of firms participate in international trade. \n \n                                                \n9  In order to avoid biased estimation results due to influential outliers, we excluded the top 2% of firms in \nterms of absolute employment growth. This reduces the sample by about 160 observations. \n10  We examined major enterprise characteristics by firm age. They do not differ substantially across firm \nage quintiles. This suggests that the bias caused by firms that did not survive might be limited. \n ", "8  |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 115 \nOnly one-quarter of enterprise owners in our sample are female.

Taken together, the results of Table 1 \nshow that, on average, firms grew, and that a considerable share of firms participates in \ninternational trade. \n \n3.2  Enterprise Growth and the Role of Initial Firm Size \n \nTable 2 describes this employment growth, applying three different measures. The first \ntwo columns of Table 2 show the mean and median values of two employment growth \nmeasures used by Mead and Liedholm (1998). The third column shows the average \nnumber of jobs that have been created per year since foundation. \n \nOur preferred measure of employment growth is the compounded measure presented in \ncolumn 2. Average annual growth rates range from 6% (Philippines) to 18% (Thailand). \nMedian values of employment growth are about half of the average values, reflecting \nheterogeneity  across  firms.  Malaysia  is  the  only  country  where  mean  and  median \nemployment growth figures are roughly similar, suggesting that the employment growth \ndistribution in Malaysia is relatively close to normal. \n \nSince foundation, the average firm in our sample created about four jobs per year. The \ncountries where the firms grew the fastest also created the most jobs: in Thailand and \nViet Nam an average of 10 and six jobs were created, respectively, per firm per year. \nMeanwhile, the average firm in the Philippines and Lao PDR only created about one job \nper year.  \n \nIn sum, Table 2 shows that enterprises in our sample have grown by about 10% since \ntheir  foundation,  but  that  growth  patterns  are  heterogeneous  between  and  within \ncountries. The next section will examine differences in employment growth across the \ninitial firm size distribution to examine how firms that started as MSEs contributed to \nemployment growth. \n \nDo MSEs Contribute to Overall Employment Growth? \n \nTable 3 shows employment growth by initial size quintile.11 Firms that started in the \nbottom quintile of the initial size distribution grew by about 21% per year. In contrast, \nfirms in the top quintile of the initial size distribution grew by only 1% per year.

In \n  \nparticular,    includes the number of full-time employees at enterprise foundation, the \n  \npercentage of the firm that is owned by a foreign entity, a dummy that takes the value 1 \nif the enterprise owner is female, a dummy that takes the value 1 if the owner has a \ncollege degree, and the firm\u2019s age. \n \nTo measure the effect of participating in international trade on employment growth we \ninclude a dummy that takes the value 1 if a firm exports and also imports inputs.14 We \nalso  use  export  intensity  (direct  and  indirect  exports  over  sales)  as  a  proxy  for \nparticipation in international trade to check the robustness of the results. To make the \ninterpretation  of  the  coefficients  straightforward,  we  will  use  the  dummy  variable \nspecification when discussing the magnitude of the trade effect. Using different proxies \nfor participation in international trade does not alter the results. Furthermore, we control \nfor heterogeneity across sectors and countries using a set of dummies.15 Finally,    \n  \nrepresents a random error term. \n \nPotential Biases \n \nIt is important to be aware of a number of biases that may affect the estimation results. \nMeasurement error will bias the results downwards and this tendency is likely to be \nexacerbated by the fact that the dependent variable used is a change over time. The \n                                                \n12  This hypothesis is supported by the fact that labor productivity is positively related to exporting in our \nsample. \n13  Although the data are cross-sectional, respondents were asked how many workers were employed in \nthe firm when it was established.  \n14  The results are still robust with variations in this definition (e.g., using an exporter dummy) and when \nomitting explanatory variables such as the size at enterprise foundation. \n15  The following sectors are summarized under other manufacturing: chemicals, auto parts, furniture, \noffice accounting and computing machinery, wood and wood products, non-metallic mineral products, \nbasic metals, fabricated metal products, construction, and transport. The sector dummy for services \nincludes the following sub-sectors: hotels and restaurants, information technology, wholesale, retail, and \nmotor vehicle services. \n ", "10  |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 115 \npossibility  of  reverse  causality  between  participating  in  international  trade  and \nemployment growth should also be considered. The model we would like to test is that \nfirms grow because of their participation in international trade, for example, because it \nallows them to exploit economies of scale. However, it is not implausible that firms are \nunable  to  export  unless  they  are  already  profitable,  and  therefore  growing,  so  the \ncausality runs from growth to exports, rather than vice versa. If that were the case, our \nresults would be biased upward. However, despite the cross-sectional character of our \ndata set, we know in which year a firm started exporting. The majority of firms for which \nthese data are provided started exporting in the year the enterprise was set up or 1 year \nlater. This lends support to the view that reverse causality is not an issue for our \nestimation. The fact that most firms export shortly after foundation means that the issue \nof  reverse causality  between  exporting  and  employment growth  is  unlikely  to  be  a \nserious cause of bias. \n \nHowever, there is a strong possibility of endogeneity bias, which can  make causal \ninterpretation of results, and therefore policy implications, misleading. Endogeneity bias \narises because it is difficult to isolate the causal effect of exporting on the employment \ngrowth of a firm from the effect of unobserved factors that are correlated with exporting. \nIt is plausible that export status is correlated with unobserved factors such as motivation \nof the manager. Businesses run by highly motivated managers are likely to expand \nrapidly, even if they do not succeed in exporting, and the motivated managers will also \nput more effort into seeking out export opportunities. In this case, an apparently large \nimpact of trade on enterprise growth could, in reality, be largely a reflection of the higher \nlevel of motivation among business owners and management. \n \nSimilar  issues  of  endogeneity  bias  have  been  addressed  in  empirical  studies  that \nexamine the effects of participating in international trade on productivity. One remedy is \nusing full information maximum likelihood (Clerides et al. 1998). However, as noted by \nBigsten et al. (2004), this approach can be sensitive to the assumptions on the joint error \ndistribution.  Another  approach  is  to  use  matching  techniques  (de Loecker 2007; \nFernandes  and  Isgut  2005;  Girma  et  al.  2004).  The  underlying  idea  behind  this \ntechnique is to match starting exporters and non-exporters based on propensity score \nmatching to get an idea  of how a firm would have performed if it had not started \nexporting. However, matching approaches are able to eliminate biases based only on \nobservables, not on observables. Further, given the cross-sectional nature of our data \nset it is not possible to use fixed-effects techniques to control for endogeneity. \n \nTherefore, we apply an instrumental variable (IV) approach, adapting the approach by \nPark et al. (2010) to our data set. The authors use the unforeseen exchange rate shocks \nin certain countries during the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis as a \u2015natural experiment.\u2016 \nFirms  that  exported  to  destination  countries  such  as  Thailand  experienced  heavy \ndemand  shocks  due  to  exchange  rate  variations,  whereas  companies  exporting  to \nEurope,  for  example,  did  not  experience  large  shocks.  The  weighted  average  real \ndepreciation among a firm\u2019s pre-crisis trade partners, which captures exchange rate \nshocks, is used as an instrument for the change in exports, in order to isolate the causal \neffect of exporting on productivity. \n ", "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises  |  11 \n \nWhile Park et al. (2010) focused on the Asian financial crisis, we exploit the variation in \nexchange  rates  caused  by  the  financial  and  economic  crisis  that  started  with  the \ncollapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008. As a consequence of this crisis, \nexchange rates, especially in the United States (US) and Europe fluctuated. The two \nmost  common  export  destinations  for  our  sample  firms  are  Japan  and  the  US.  A \nsignificant proportion of firms also export to Europe.16 As the main export destinations \nand the proportions received by each vary by firm, exposure to the shocks varies. \n \nThe exchange rate shock variable is a suitable instrument if it is strongly related to \nexport intensity, but unrelated to any unobserved factors. The latter is a reasonable \nassumption, as the exchange rate shocks experienced between 2005 and 2008 were \nlargely unforeseen by firms (and indeed by economic analysts). Further, the firms in the \nsample had no significant influence over these economic events as the crisis originated \nin the US (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009).  \n \nThe first requirement will be met if trade intensity in 2008 is strongly related to the shock \nvariable. This will be the case if firms that experience an exchange rate shock react by \nreducing the proportion of goods that they export. This is likely to occur if it is easier for \nthem to re-orient sales toward the domestic market than to find new export partners in \nthe short-term. In this case, the firms that experienced the bigger shocks would have \nlower  export  intensities  than  firms  that  experienced  either  no  shock  or  a  positive \nchange.17 \n \nExporting  firms  in  three  countries  in  our  data  set  (Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and \nViet Nam) reported information on their two most important export partners. In line with \nPark et al. (2010), we compute the exchange rate shock for each destination country   as \nfollows: \n \n           {[  (  )-       ]-[  (  )-       ]}       (3) \n                         \n \nIn Equation (3),    is the nominal exchange rate (local currency unit per unit of the \n  \nrespective destination country currency) in year  , and    is the price level.18 We follow \n   \nthe approach of Park et al. (2010) and create a firm-level indicator for exchange rate \nvariations by weighting the exchange rate index by the share of sales destined for the \nrespective destination country in 2008. We obtain a firm-level exchange rate index as \nfollows: \n \n                                            (4) \n               \n \n                                                \n16  About 40% of firms indicate either Japan or the US as their top export destination, while 10% of all firms \nreport the European Union as their top export destination. \n17  Firms in our data set report exports and the export shares of the two most important destination \ncountries in 2008. Due to contracts negotiated before the crisis that had to be fulfilled there could be \nsome delay in the reaction of exporters. Hence, by using data from only 2008 it could be that we are \nunderestimating the impact of the exchange rate shock on export intensities. \n18  Exchange rate data stem from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) \ndatabase. Data on consumer price indexes stem from the World Bank World Development Indicators \n(WDI). \n ", "12  |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 115 \nThe shares of the destination countries of firm   are represented by   . The numbers \n   \n        represent the two most important export destinations.19 If a firm only reports the \nshare for the most important destination country, we give that country a weight of 100%. \nThe larger the value of the          variable, the larger the increase in the price of \n \nexported goods, on average, in the local currencies of the destination countries. Ceteris \nparibus, this would reduce exports. Using a firm-level variable as an instrument has the \nadvantage that we can still include country and sector dummies in the IV estimation. \n \nOnly cross-sectional data are available, so we focus on the relationship between the \nshock and export intensity in 2008, rather than on the change in exports between 2005 \nand 2008, as in the approach of Park et al. (2010). \n \nIt should be noted that using this approach restricts the sample to firms that export, \nwhich is around 30% of the sample. As well as reducing the sample size significantly, \nthis means that the equation captures only part of the effect of trade on firm growth. If \nthere is a large benefit to exporting regardless of quantity (a non-linear effect), the \nIV approach will understate the benefits of exporting, as it is restricted only to those firms \nthat export at least part of their production.20 \n \nEstimation Results \n \nThe results are reported in Table 4. Columns 1 to 4 report the ordinary least squares \n(OLS) results. In the first specification we include only the export intensity variable and \ncountry and sector dummies, and use data from all six countries in the data set. In \ncolumn 2 we add all control variables as described above. In the third column we use a \ndummy that takes the value 1 if a firm exports and also imports inputs as a proxy for \nparticipation in international trade. In column 4 we show the results using only data from \nthe three countries that reported information on their export partners. These countries \nare the ones used in the IV estimates. In column 5 we report the results of the IV \nestimation, using the weighted exchange rate shock between 2005 and 2008 as an \ninstrument for export intensity. In column 6 we report OLS estimates using the same \nsample that was used for the IV estimates. We use Viet Nam as the reference country \nand machinery and equipment as the reference sector.  \n \nThe first four specifications show highly significant coefficients for the trade variables, \nwhich are stable across all specifications. These results are robust for a number of \nvariations in the key variables.21 Another finding that is robust across all specifications is \nthat firms that started small expand faster, controlling for other factors.22 The foreign \n                                                \n19  Among all countries, about 74% of exports go to the two most important export destinations. Hence, the \ndata constraint of having only data on the two most important export destinations is not critical for our \nanalysis. \n20  Note that the information on export destination shares is very noisy. Only half of all exporters report \nconsistent information on destination countries and/or their shares of exports. \n21  The results remain stable when running the regression by size and age groups, and alternative \ndefinitions of employment growth (e.g., absolute growth of employment or a log specification of \nemployment growth). \n22  The sign and magnitude of the age variable is in line with other studies such as Dinh et al.

The coefficient is \npositive and of similar magnitude in all other specifications. The coefficient on the gender \nof the enterprise owner is negative in most specifications, and is significant for the \nsample used in the IV specification (only exporting firms).23 The level of education of the \nowner seems to matter too as the dummy education variable is positive and significant in \nall specifications. \n \nIncluding control variables leads to a considerable increase in the adjusted R-squared, \nbut has little effect on the trade variables. The estimates from the six-country sample are \nof similar magnitude as the results using the three-country sample. \n \nAs could be expected from the descriptive statistics, the Thailand dummy (not reported) \nis significant and positive. The other country dummies show that after controlling for \nindividual and enterprise characteristics, employment growth was significantly lower in \nIndonesia and the Philippines than in Viet Nam. Firms in the electronics sector show the \nhighest growth rates after controlling for country effects and individual and enterprise \ncharacteristics. \n \nHowever, as described above, these results should be interpreted with caution because \nof the strong possibility that they are affected by endogeneity bias. Therefore, in column \n5 we introduce the instrumental variable approach described above. We report the \nsecond stage IV estimates in column 5. The first stage estimates show the expected \nnegative and highly significant (t-value of \u20132.61) relationship between export intensity \nand our exchange rate shock index (see Appendix for the complete results).  \n \nThe  null  hypothesis  of under-identification  is  rejected  at  the  5%  confidence  level.24 \nHowever, an F Test of whether all excluded instruments are significant suggests that the \ninstrument may be weak. This test in our data set has an F-value of 6.8. According to the \nthresholds  defined  in  Stock  et  al.  (2002),  this  means  that  the  null  hypothesis  (the \ninstrument is insignificant) can be rejected only at the 20% level.25  \n \nAs  explained  by  Stock  et  al.  (2002),  the  presence  of  weak  instruments  leads  to \nunreliable point estimates and confidence intervals. This means that the IV estimates \nshould  be  interpreted  with  caution,  and  is  likely  to  explain  the  fact  that  the \nIV specification provides only weak evidence for the impact of trade on employment \ngrowth. Neither specification shows a significant coefficient for trade intensity. However, \nthe fact that the coefficient does not change signs and remains of a similar magnitude is \nencouraging. Large swings in the coefficient and implausible magnitudes are common \ncharacteristics  of  very  weak  instruments.

Another factor behind the lack of a significant result in the IV specification is \nthat  the  data  on  export  destinations  and  export  shares  are  very  noisy,  so  many \nobservations need to be dropped, resulting in a small sample size. \n  \nTaken together, the evidence suggests, subject to the potential biases mentioned above, \nthat participating in international trade raises employment growth. After controlling for \nsector and country effects as well as differences in firm and individual characteristics, \nemployment  growth  in  firms  that  export  and  import  inputs  was  about  3%  higher \ncompared with all remaining firms. The results are robust for variations in the trade \nvariable and also for variations in the countries included.26 \n \n3.4  Who are the Top Performers in Terms of Employment Growth? \n \nFirm Characteristics \n \nIn order to derive suggestions for policy measures, we now examine the characteristics \nof the firms that have grown the most since their foundation. We define top performers \nas enterprises in the top quintile of enterprise growth. Table 5 shows differences in firm \nand individual characteristics between top performers and all remaining firms.  \n \nOverall, the results show that top performers and the remaining firms differ significantly \nin all categories except for the education of the owner and the percentage of female \nowners.27 About one-quarter of top performers are participating in international trade, \ncompared  with  one-fifth  of  firms  that  are  not  defined  as  top  performers.  Also  top \nperformers started significantly smaller, which is in line with the findings of Tables 3 and \n4. Again, the median values for initial size are smaller than mean values, reflecting the \nskewed initial size distribution. The results also show that one-third of top performing \nfirms started as MSEs with fewer than five employees. In addition, top performers are on \naverage  about  10  years  younger.  This  may  reflect  higher  capacity  to  adopt  new \ntechnologies that increase productivity. However, this effect may also be caused by firms \nclosing down if they did not grow fast enough.  \n \nFor top performers the experience of the owner exceeds the firm age, on average, \nwhereas for the other firms the firm age exceeds the years of experience of the owner. \nSo even if one assumes that the owner has worked in a top-performing enterprise since \nits foundation, she would have had on average about 3 years of experience when \nfounding the company. For the remaining firms it could be that the recent owner who has \nless years of experience than the firm age took over the business from a family member. \nSuch  enterprises  might  find  it  harder  to  adopt  new  production  technologies.  The \npercentage of firms whose owner have a college degree or are female do not vary \nsignificantly between top performers and other firms. Finally, top performers have a \nsignificantly higher percentage of foreign ownership. This is plausible since being part of \nan international company may facilitate intra-firm knowledge spillovers. \n \n                                                \n26  We ran separate regressions including only Malaysia and Thailand, and regressions including only \nIndonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. The main findings were not altered. \n27  The results are based on a T test assuming unequal differences between the groups. ", "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises  |  15 \n \nTo learn more about the relative importance of the determinants of being a top performer \nwe run a probit model of the following form: \n \n                                                                (5) \n            \n \nThe dependent variable in Equation (5) is a dummy that takes the value 1 if firm   in \ncountry   is a top performer. The vector   includes the control variables that were used in \nTable  5.  The  coefficients  and  marginal  effects  from  estimating  (5)  are  reported  in      \nTable 6. The pseudo R-squared shows that the chosen indicators are able to explain a \nsubstantial part of whether or not firms are top performers. The results show that the \ngender and expertise of the owner do not significantly influence the likelihood of being a \ntop performer. \n \nInitial  firm  size  and  the  percentage  of  foreign  ownership  show  significant  marginal \neffects, although the coefficients are very small. Furthermore, the results show that \nyounger firms are more likely to be top performers. Since top performers and other firms \ndo not differ substantially in terms of the owner\u2019s education, the positive and significant \ncoefficient on the college dummy is unexpected. However, this effect only occurs when \nwe also control for firm age. Hence, the reason for the change of significance in the \neducation variable is that more educated persons tend to be owners of older firms. This \nmeans that not considering firm age hides the effect of education. After controlling for \nfirm age, having a college degree increases the probability of being a top performer by \nroughly 5%. The marginal effect of participating in international trade is even bigger. The \nresults show that participating in international trade increases the probability of being in \nthe top quintile of employment growth by about 10%.  \n \nThe country dummies show that, ceteris paribus, the probability of being a top performer \nis highest in Malaysia, which was chosen as the reference category. This result may be \ndriven by the rapidly expanding rubber sector in Malaysia.28 The results from the sector \ndummies show that being in the machinery or services sector significantly lowers the \nprobability of being a top performer. These findings need to be interpreted with caution \nas the hypothesis that the sector dummies are jointly zero can only be rejected at the 5% \nconfidence level, according to a joint F test. \n \nThe marginal effect estimates should also be interpreted with caution. The potential \nissues of reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity discussed in the context of \nTable 4 apply also to the results presented in Table 6. In addition, our data set only \nincludes firms that survived until the date of the survey. Not accounting for unsuccessful \nbusiness ventures biases our result upwards. Nonetheless, the findings that education \nand participating in trade substantially increase the probability of being a top performer \nare both interesting and relevant for policymakers in Asia. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n28  The results reported in Table 7 show that about one-fourth of top performing firms in Thailand and \nMalaysia can be found in the rubber sector. \n ", "16  |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 115 \nSectoral Distribution of Top Performers \n \nTo design targeted policies to foster employment growth it is also important to know \nwhich sectors are home to successful entrepreneurs.

Using firm-level data from \nWorld  Bank  Enterprise  Surveys  in  Indonesia,  Lao  PDR,  Malaysia,  Thailand,  the \nPhilippines, and Viet Nam, we examine the following questions: \n \nCan we observe employment growth in MSEs? If so, do firms that started small \ncontribute to overall employment growth? \n \nUsing a compounded measure of employment growth, we find that firms in the bottom \nquintile of the initial size distribution grew on average by 20% per annum, which is \nsignificantly higher than the overall average employment growth rate of about 10%. Our \nresults also show that 15% of all jobs created by firms in our sample were created by \nfirms in the bottom quintile of the initial size distribution. Based on these results, we \nconclude that firms that started small contributed considerably to overall employment \ngrowth. \n \nHow does participating in international trade contribute to employment growth? \n \nWe find that after controlling for firm and individual characteristics, firms that export and \nalso import inputs grew on average 3% faster per year than all remaining firms after \ncontrolling for country, sector, and individual characteristics.  \n                                                \n29  The data on Lao PDR only distinguishes between services and manufacturing. The top performers are \napproximately evenly distributed between the two groups.  ", "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises  |  17 \n \nThese results need to be interpreted with caution as the sample only includes firms that \nsurvived until the date of the survey. Not controlling for unsuccessful firms biases our \nresults upward. Furthermore, given the variables included in our data set, we cannot rule \nout the issue of endogeneity between participating in international trade and employment \ngrowth. However, the fact that firms start exporting quickly after their foundation lends \nsupport to the hypothesis that participating in international trade causes employment \ngrowth and not vice versa. The results of the IV estimation do not show a significant \neffect of trade on employment growth, possibly because the only available instrument is \nsomewhat weak. However, they provide no evidence to suggest that endogeneity is \ndriving the relationship. Also, the first stage estimation results are very similar to Park et \nal. (2010) who successfully use exchange rate fluctuations during the 1997/98 Asian \nfinancial crisis as an instrument. Further investigation using this IV approach with a \nlarger sample and more precise data could be fruitful. Our findings are in line with other \nstudies, such as Dinh et al. (2010), and support the hypothesis that participating in \ninternational trade boosts employment growth.  \n \nWhat are the characteristics of firms that grew particularly fast? \n \nWe define top performing firms as firms in the top quintile of the employment growth \ndistribution. The results show the high potential of MSEs, as one-third of top performing \nenterprises started with fewer than five employees. Using probit estimates, we show that \nin addition to participating in international trade, which is associated with a 10% boost in \nthe likelihood of being a top performer, the education level of the enterprise owner \nmatters. After controlling for country, sector, and other individual and firm characteristics, \nthe results show that the owner having a college degree increases the likelihood of being \na top performer by 5%. In addition to education of the owner and participating in trade, \nyounger firms have a higher probability of being top performers. \n \nWhat does this mean for policymakers? \n \nThe finding that MSEs and participating in international trade play an important role in \nemployment growth suggests that policymakers could boost job creation by making it \neasier for firms to plug into international trade networks. A number of measures could be \nconsidered, such as simplification of customs procedures for MSEs or small export \nvolumes, provision of information on customs procedures, or the offering of export credit \nor guarantee products designed to be accessible to MSEs. \n \nGiven  the finding  that the  education  level  of  a firm\u2019s  owner  increases  employment \ngrowth, these sorts of measures are likely to be most effective if they are combined with \ntraining.  Training  could  cover  issues  such  as  the  regulations  and  norms  that  are \nnecessary to participate in international trade (e.g., quality standards for exports or \nimport regulations to obtain raw materials that cannot be sourced domestically). The \nfindings also suggest that entrepreneurs who are already educated and have some \nexperience are more likely to initiate successful enterprises and may therefore be more \nlikely to benefit from training. Hence, training and information campaigns could be most \neffective if they are targeted at persons with a certain minimum level of education. \n \n ", "18  |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 115 \nThe finding that most firms start exporting relatively quickly after their establishment also \nhas  policy  implications.  Advice  and  training  on  how  to  plug  into  international  trade \nnetworks should be available to potential entrepreneurs even before the establishment \nof an enterprise. \n \nWe observe that only one-quarter of all entrepreneurs in our sample are female. This \nmay reflect the fact that due to social norms potentially talented female entrepreneurs \nlack the opportunity to establish enterprises. Overall, the data do not allow us to make \nspecific recommendations for targeting either male or female entrepreneurs, but access \nto training or other interventions should certainly be open to both genders.  \n \nOur  results  on  the  question  of  which  sectors  are  promising  are  not  conclusive.  In \ngeneral, the targeting of specific gender groups and sectors needs to be decided on a \ncase-by-case basis and rely on a detailed analysis of the national context. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises  |  19 \n \nReferences \n \nA.

Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people.

Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No.  WPS135858    Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Jens Kr\u00fcger", "CreationDate": "D:20130726143107+08'00'", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010", "Keywords": "MSEs, micro- and small enterprises, MSE graduation, trade, employment growth, developing asia, indonesia, malaysia, lao pdr, thailand, philippines, vietnam, viet nam, southeast asia, regional economic integration working paper no. 115", "ModDate": "D:20130911190748+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010", "Subject": "This paper examines the role of international trade in employment growth in micro- and small enterprises using a representative sample of manufacturing firms in six Southeast Asian countries.", "Title": "The Role of International Trade in Employment Growth in Micro- and Small Enterprises: Evidence from Developing Asia"}}
