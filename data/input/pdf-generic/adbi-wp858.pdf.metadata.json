Ahunov \n\nAbstract \n \nThe  level  of  financial  inclusion  in  Uzbekistan  remains  low:  the  majority  of  households  and \nfirms,  rather  than  using  formal  finance,  save  and  borrow  informally,  and  few  use  digital \nfinance  products.  Both  indicate  the  high  cost  of  finance  as  the  top  reason  for  not  using  it. \nSecondly,  households,  which  are  mostly  Muslim,  declare  that  religious  reasons  prevent  \nthem from using formal finance, as only conventional finance is available. Unlike households, \nfirms  report  that  complex  application  procedures  and  high  collateral  requirements  are  the \nsecond and third most important reasons for not using formal finance. Financial inclusion is \ntherefore constrained on the supply side. Policy recommendations include: promoting private \nand  foreign  capital  participation  in  all  segments  of  finance;  removing/limiting  the  use  of  \ndirect  interest  rate  controls  and  administrative  policy  tools;  and  facilitating  infrastructure \ndevelopment  to  promote  digital  finance.  Demand-side  policies,  like  improving  financial \nliteracy  and  customer  protection,  are  necessary  to  supplement  these  policies.  Strikingly,  \nthe  country  needs  to  create  a  financial  inclusion  and  education  strategy  that  will  enable  \nbetter-coordinated actions, leading to sustainable results. \n \nKeywords: access to finance, obstacles, liberalization, financial literacy, customer protection  \n \nJEL Classification: G21, G28, L22, O16 \n \n\n \n\n\fM.

INTRODUCTION \n\nM. Ahunov \n\nIn his speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization in 2017, the \nPresident of Uzbekistan, as one of his key messages, outlined an important principle: \n\u201cthe wealthier are the people, the stronger is the state.\u201d1 Promoting financial inclusion, \nthat is, providing people with access to payment services, savings accounts, loans, and \ninsurance  at  a  reasonable  cost,  might  be  instrumental  in  achieving  this  goal.  Recent \nevidence  from  around  the  world  has  shown  that  financial  inclusion  can  contribute  to \ninclusive  growth  and  economic  development  (Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt  and  Singer  2017).  This \nchapter  therefore  aims  to  assess  the  state  of  financial  inclusion  in  Uzbekistan  as  of \n2018 and to identify the obstacles and the opportunities to promote it.  \n\nThis  chapter  uses  a  nationally  representative  household  survey,  the  Life  in  Transition \nSurvey Wave 3, which the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment (EBRD) administered in 2016. It also uses a firm-level survey called the \nBusiness  Environment  Survey,  which  the  World  Bank  conducted  in  2013.  The  World \nBank  also  administered  the  Global  Findex  Survey  among  a  representative  number  \nof  individuals  in  Uzbekistan  in  2008  and  2014.  The  study  further  uses  a  range  of \nsecondary data from the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU), the World Bank, and the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) along with findings from local studies. These are all \nthe most recent sources available on this research topic.  \n\n2.  OVERVIEW OF UZBEKISTAN\u2019S FINANCIAL SYSTEM  \n\nUzbekistan\u2019s financial system is bank based, with commercial banks playing a key role. \nThe other types of financial intermediaries that operate in this market are non-deposit-\ntaking microfinance institutions. These play little or no role. Similarly, no formal crowd \nfinance  platform  exists,  and  the  financial  markets  are  underdeveloped.  The  level  of \nfinancial intermediation has traditionally been low, as the relatively low banking sector \ncredit to GDP ratio compared with other transition economies evidences (see Figure 1). \nHowever,  with  the  new  President,  the  country  made  significant  progress  in  financial \nliberalization between 2016 and 2018. As a result, financial intermediation has surged; \nin 2018, as the Central Bank of Uzbekistan reported, the banking sector credit to GDP \nratio was 42.2% versus 26% and 19.4%, respectively, in 2016 and 2012.  \n\nTable 1 shows that the importance of deposits as a source of funds declined between \n2017  and  2018.  Thus,  the  direct  borrowing  of  commercial  banks  mainly  from  state \nfunds  and  to  a  lesser  extent  from  international  credit  lines  funded  the  surge  in  bank \nlending that the CBU (2018) explained. The CBU (2018) reported that, between 2017 \nand  2018,  the  share  of  borrowed  funds  of  commercial  banks  in  their  total  liabilities \nincreased  from  36%  to  50%.  Table  1  indicates  that  the  share  of  deposits  in  the  total \nliabilities  decreased  from  48%  to  40%  between  2017  and  2018.  As  Table  1  shows, \ndemand deposits dominated, making up more than half of the total deposits. Only 9.2% \nof deposits had a maturity of one year and more. The funding structure of commercial \nbanks is indicative of two issues: low depositor confidence in banking and the presence \nof tight constraints on banks\u2019 ability to extend loans, especially for long-term periods.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   President  Shavkat  Mirziyoev\u2019s  speech \n\nhttps://www.gazeta.uz/ru/2017/09/20/un-ga-speech/ (accessed 29 May 2018). \n\nis  available \n\nfrom \n\nthe  online  newspaper  Gazeta.uz. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 858 \n \n\nM.

In 2018, 11 out \nof 28 banks had direct or indirect state ownership. All these 11 banks jointly controlled \nover  82%  of  the  total  banking  sector  assets,  over  66%  and  88%,  respectively,  of  the \ndeposit and loan market shares as of 1 January 2018 (CBU 2018). This is in line with \n2012, as the ADB (2014) noted, declaring that state-owned banks controlled 86.8% of \nthe  total  loan  portfolio  and  69.4%  of  all  deposits.  The  market  share  of  state-owned \nbanks in deposit markets has thus been declining.  \n\nAs  the  IMF (2013)  reported,  state-owned  banks  mainly  finance  large  government \nprograms and projects. The lending rate in these state-led projects is often below the \nmarket rate, which impedes banks\u2019 risk management and leads to segmentation of the \nbanking market. For instance, the IMF (2018) stated:  \n\nUzbekistan\u2019s  credit  market  is  highly  segmented,  with  SOEs  [state-owned \nenterprises] enjoying preferential access to credit. The FX segment of the credit \nmarket is dominated by SOEs, which receive FX credit either directly from state \nbanks  or  through  on-lending  operations  by  government  entities  ...  These \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 858 \n \n\nM. Ahunov \n\ndirected  FX  credits  are  often  granted  at  highly  preferential  terms,  depressing \nbanks\u2019  profitability.  By  contrast,  the  private  sector  is  largely  confined  to  the \ndomestic  currency  segment  of  the  credit  market,  where  loan  mark-ups  may  in \npart reflect banks\u2019 attempt to recoup low margins on concessional lending. \n\nAll state banks specialize in a specific sector and mostly channel state funds. The IMF \n(2018)  declared  that  56%  of  its  total  loans  have  been  extended  to  state-owned \nenterprises  and  joint  ventures.  Similarly,  the  deposits  and  loans  of  the  Government \nconstitute  51%  of  the  liabilities  of  banks.  The  IMF  also  reported  that  state-owned \nenterprises\u2019  deposits  make  up  13%  of  banking  sector  liabilities.  Thus,  banks  mainly \nintermediate  between  different  government-owned  enterprises  and  funds.  Each  state-\nowned bank has a specific function. For instance, the National Bank of Uzbekistan for \nForeign  Economic  Activity,  the  largest  bank  in  the  country,  specializes,  as  its  name \nsuggests,  in  financing  foreign  trade  and  export  facilitation  programs.  Similarly,  the \nPeople\u2019s Bank, which controlled 3.3% of the banking market share in 2018, is the main \nstate bank for social payments and pensions and for serving public sector payments. \n\nTable 2: Uzbekistan\u2019s Banking System Ownership and Concentration \n\n \n\nMarket share of top three banks  \nMarket share of top five banks  \nState-owned banks \nShareholding banks with indirect state ownership \nBanks with foreign ownership \n\nSource: We estimated the market shares using CBU data. \n\nMarket Share (Percentage of Banking \nAssets) \n\n2001 \n86.6 \n91.3 \n82.2 \n6.1 \n0.9 \n\n2014 \n50.6 \n63.7 \n41.2 \n35.5 \n8.7 \n\n2016 \n49.7 \n62.9 \n41.4 \n33.7 \n9.9 \n\n2018 \n59.9 \n71.8 \n48.8 \n33.2 \n7.7 \n\nAs Table 2 also shows, Uzbekistan\u2019s banking sector is highly concentrated. The three \nlargest banks jointly controlled 59.9% of the total banking assets in 2018 versus 86.6% \nin  2001.  Thus,  concentration  has  been  declining.  In  2001,  the  National  Bank  of \nUzbekistan alone controlled 76% of the total banking sector assets versus 30.9% as of \n1 January 2018. The NBU is still the largest bank, controlling 19.5% and 18.5% of the \ndeposit and loan market shares in 2018.  \n\nForeign bank penetration remains low. As Table 2 shows, banks with foreign ownership \njointly controlled 7.7% of the total banking sector assets in 2018. Unlike the situation in \nother  transition  economies,  like  Ukraine,  Kazakhstan,  and  Poland,  banks  with  foreign \nownership  first  entered  the  country  by  creating  a  new  institution,  that  is,  through \n\u201cgreenfield investments.\u201d The market share of these banks has been small; according \nto the CBU, it is below 1%, and they have limited their activity to financing businesses \nfrom their home countries. The other three banks with foreign ownership resulted from \ncross-border takeovers, and these control around 9% of the banking sector assets. \n\nTable  2  shows  that  the  share  of  banks  with  no  state  ownership  increased  from  0.8%  \nof  the  banking  sector  assets  in  2001  to  13%  in  2018.  Unlike  their  peers  with  state \nownership,  these  banks  mainly  deal  with  private  sector  deposits  and  loans.  Note  that \nthe  number  of  private  banks  has  been  stable,  and  this  is  possibly  due  to  the  strict \nlicensing  regulations  for  the  entry  of  new  private  banks,  as  Ruziev  and  Ghosh  \n(2009) noted. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 858 \n \n\nM.

All figures are as of 1 January of the respective year.  \n\nAccording to the CBU (2018), almost all the banks in Uzbekistan have a credit ranking \nfrom international institutions like Moody\u2019s and Fitch, and they are all ranked as stable.2 \nThis is in line with the IMF (2000, 2008, 2013). The high level of capitalization was due \nto direct state capital injections into state-owned banks (IMF 2013).  \n\nFigure 2: Domestic Credit and Gross Domestic Product per Capita \n\nSource: World Development Indicators database. \n\n \n\nTable  3  also  reports  the  key  financial  performance  indicators  of  the  Uzbek  banking \nsystem.  The  regulatory  bank  capital  to  risk-adjusted  asset  ratio,  profitability  indicators \nsuch  as  return  on  assets,  and  equity  are  high  and  improving;  the  level  of  \nnon-performing  loans  is  low.  Thus,  credit  rationing  seems  to  be  relatively  high  in \nUzbekistan judging from the level of domestic credit to the private sector, which is well \nbelow  the  average  compared  with  countries  with  a  similar  level  of  development,  as \nFigure 2 shows. \n\n                                                 \n2   Information  on  credit  rankings  is  available  on  the  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  website.

Ahunov \n\nAs  mentioned  earlier,  Uzbekistan  has  no  deposit-taking  microfinance  institutions,  \nsuch as credit unions, like the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have. The Credit Union \nLaw  came  into  force  in  2002  and  led  to  the  rapid  entry  of  new  institutions  into  the \nfinancial  market:  the  number  of  credit  unions  surged  from  20  in  2004  to  163  in  2010 \n(see  Table 3).  However,  deposit-taking  microfinance  institutions  ceased  existence  in \n2010 with the reversal of the law; they were all turned into non-deposit-taking financial \ninstitutions  that  lend  their  own  funds.  The  evidence  on  the  quality  of  credit  union \nservices  is  mixed.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  credit  unions  have  been \nsuccessful  in  promoting  access  to  finance  among  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (ADB  2009).  On  the  contrary,  the  Centre  for  Economic  Research  (2011) \n(hereafter:  CER),  based  on  the  National  Income  Mobilization  Survey,  which  claims  to \nbe  a  nationally  representative  survey,  reported  that  in  2010  50%  of  respondents \ncomplained  about  a  delay  in  accessing  their  deposits  at  credit  unions  and  26%  of \nclients declared that the credit union interest rates were high.  \n\nTable 4: Geographic Outreach of Financial Institutions in Uzbekistan \n\nIndicator Name \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\n2008 \n\n2010 \n\n2012 \n\n2014 \n\n2016 \n\n2018 \n\nNumber of:  \n  Commercial banks \n  Non-deposit-taking microfin. inst. \nCommercial bank branches/mini banks/units: \n  Number  \n  Branches per 100,000 adults \n  Branches per 1000 km2 \nAutomated teller machines (ATMs): \n  Number  \n  ATMs per 100,000 adults \n  ATMs per 1000 km2 \n\n \n31 \n1 \n \n6,701 \n39.1 \n15.8 \n \n151 \n0.9 \n0.4 \n\n \n31 \n93 \n \n\n \n28 \n14 \n \n\n \n30 \n60 \n \n\n \n28 \n76 \n \n\n \n27 \n76 \n \n\n \n26 \n71 \n \n\n \n29 \n76 \n \n7,627  7,712  7,900  8,058  8,237  8,263  8,864 \n27.7 \n38.0 \n42.3 \n19.8 \n19.0 \n18.0 \n \n \n \n \n171 \n \n0.9 \n \n0.4 \n\n37.4 \n19.4 \n \n1,417  1,870  4,954 \n21.6 \n8.5 \n11.6 \n4.4 \n\n39.2 \n18.6 \n \n807 \n4.0 \n1.9 \n\n40.7 \n18.2 \n \n318 \n1.7 \n0.7 \n\n36.1 \n19.5 \n \n\n6.7 \n3.3 \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, Financial Access Database. \n\nTable 4 shows that the banking sector outreach surged between 2004 and 2018, as the \nincrease  in  the  number  of  ATMs  per  100,000  adults  and  per  1000  km2  evidences.  In \n2004,  there  were  only  0.9  ATMs  per  100,000  adults  versus  21.6  ATMs  in  2016.  The \nbanking  sector  outreach  has  remained  stable  in  terms  of  bank  branch  penetration;  \nfor  every  100,000  adults,  there  were  39.1  branches  in  2004  versus  36.1  branches  in \n2016.  Table  5  shows  the  banking  outreach  and  indicates  that  the  use  is  uneven  \nacross  regions.  In  Tashkent  City  in  2017,  users  paid  7595.3  thousand  UZS  in  per \ncapita terms using point of sales terminals, and SME loans issued 3076 thousand UZS \nin per capita terms. In the capital city, there was one ATM/information unmanned kiosk \nper 821 people. The Navoi region has the second-highest bank penetration indicators; \nhowever,  it  has  2.5  times  lower  per  capita  payments  through  POS  and  more  than  \n3  times  fewer  SME  loans  per  capita.

In \n2000,  the  Cabinet  of  the  Minister  of  Uzbekistan  made  the  decision  to  create  the  first \ncredit  bureau  as  part  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  banking  association.3 In  2004,  the  bureau  was \nturned into a legally independent unit. In 2012, based on the public credit bureau, the \ndecision was made to create a private credit bureau. As Table 6 shows, as of 2016, the \nprivate  credit  bureau  covers  27.8%  of  the  adult  population.

Ahunov \n\nIn Uzbekistan, the Findex 2017 survey reported that 94% of the adult population has a \nnational  identity  card  (passport);  this  is  high  relative  to  92%  of  lower-middle-income \ncountries.  In  addition,  in  December  2017,  the  CBU  announced  that,  during  2018,  the \ncountry  will  introduce  a  common  national  platform  for  the  remote  identification  of \nclients. Specifically, this will involve upgrading the National Database of Depositors by \ncreating  unique  ID  numbers  for  the  people  registered  in  the  system.  As  the  CBU \nreported,  the  introduction  of  electronic  identification  numbers  will  enable  people  to \naccess remote banking services, which are increasing day by day.5  \n\n3.  STATUS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION  \n\n3.1  Financial Inclusion of Households \n\nUzbekistan, as Yoshino and Morgan (2016) also noted, is among the countries with a \nlow bank account penetration rate; according to the 2014 Findex survey, only 26% of \npeople aged 15 and older held an account with a financial institution. Beck and Brown \n(2011), based on the nationally representative sample of the Life in Transition Survey \n2, which the EBRD and the World Bank administered in 2010, listed Uzbekistan among \nthe  transition  countries  with  a  low  level  of  banking  service  use.  However,  the  2017 \nFindex  survey  reported  that  37%  of  people  aged  15  and  older  had  an  account;  \nthus,  the  account  penetration  had  increased  but  remained  low.  Table  7  presents \nadditional  evidence  on  the  increase  in  account  penetration,  showing  that  the  number  \nof  bank  cards  increased  2.5  times  in  2017  relative  to  2011.  The  World  Bank  World \nDevelopment  Indicators  database  shows  that  the  account  penetration  rate  in \nUzbekistan is higher than in countries with a similar level of GDP per capita. The major \ndriver behind bank card use is the legislation requiring organizations and state-owned \ncompanies  to  pay  salaries  through  a  transfer  to  a  bank  card.  For  instance,  the  ADB \n(2014) reported that the most common method of paying salaries in the formal sector is \nthrough  direct  transfers  to  employees\u2019  bank  cards;  this  is  a  result  of  the  government \npolicy  aimed  at  reducing  money  out  of  bank  circulation  and  deepening  non-cash \npayments. As a result, more than 19 million bank cards were in use as of January 2017 \nversus  only  32  thousand  in  1999. 6  Similarly,  according  to  the  Central  Bank  of \nUzbekistan,  the  total  amount  of  transactions  using  bank  cards  reached  53,050  billion \nUzbek soms (6.5 billion United States dollars) in January 2016 as opposed to 0.1 billion \nUzbek soms in 2004.  \n\nTable  7  shows  a  surge  in  Internet  and  mobile  use  in  Uzbekistan.  The  number  of \nInternet banking users increased from 0.4% of depositors in 2011 to 2.3% in 2017. The \nuse  of  mobile  banking  increased  from  0.3%  of  depositors  in  2011  to  32.8%  in  2017. \nThe CER (2015) reported that the surge in electronic banking products was a result of \nthe regulatory changes. Table 8 shows that most of the laws on the use of information \nresources  and  systems,  electronic  signatures,  and  commerce  came  into  force  from \n2004.  An  important  milestone  in  the  development  of  electronic  payments  was  the \nCommon Republican Processing Centre\u2019s and e-payment company Click\u2019s introduction \nof the mobile payment system. As the CER (2015) stated, the adoption of the law on \nelectronic  payments  provided  a  strong  impetus  for  the  development  of  the  system. \nHowever,  mobile  banking  and  Internet  banking  have  considerable  room  to  improve. \nFirst,  the  CBU  reported  that  payments  for  utility  services,  like  the  gas  and  electricity \n\n                                                 \n5   Information  on  this  is  available  from  the  website  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan.

The  main \nbottleneck  in  this  development  is  the  low  speed  of  the  Internet  in  the  country;  for \ninstance, as of January 2018, Uzbekistan ranks 122nd and 119th out of 129 countries \nin  broadband  and  mobile  Internet  speed,  respectively,  in  the  Speedtest  Global \nRanking,  which  compares  Internet  speed  across  countries. 7 The  countries  with  the \nhighest rank have high speed and those with a low rank have low speed.

First,  as  in  the  rest  of  the \ntransition  economies  in  Europe  and  Central  Asia  (ECA),  account  and  debit  card \nownership  increased  for  all  groups  of  adult  people  in  Uzbekistan  between  2011  and \n2017.

Ahunov \n\nbetween  people  within  and  outside  the  labor  force  has  narrowed.  That  is  because,  in \n2015  and  2016,  the  state  started  to  transfer  old  age  pensions  and  other  social \npayments to a bank card. Third, young adults are relatively more financially excluded, \nas  the  relatively  low  percentage  of  people  in  this  category  who  own  a  bank  account \nevidences.  Similarly,  the  gap  is  large  depending  on  the  education  and  income  level. \nTable 10 suggests that the proportionate increase in account ownership is greater than \nthat in debit card ownership. Moreover, account ownership is proportionally higher for \nmales relative to females; this gap is smaller than that found in countries in the similar \nincome group. On the contrary, 22.1% of females have a debit card versus only 26.4% \nof  males.  Strikingly,  in  Uzbekistan,  the  percentages  of  adult  people  with  an  account \nand a debit card are much lower than those in the rest of the transition economies in \nEurope and Central Asia, as Tables 9 and 10 show.  \n\nTable 9: Formal Account Ownership at a Financial Institution \n\nUzbekistan \n\nEurope and Central Asia \n\n2011 \n\n2014 \n\n2017 \n\n2011 \n\n2014 \n\n2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Findex database; note that all numbers are percentages of people aged 15+ of the respective category unless \notherwise indicated.  \n\nTable 10: Debit Card Ownership \n\n \n\n \n\nUzbekistan \n\nEurope and Central Asia \n\n2011 \n\n2014 \n\n2017 \n\n2011 \n\n2014 \n\n2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40.7 \n42.2 \n43.1 \n36.4 \n39.3 \n24.9 \n47.9 \n24.3 \n48.2 \n35.3 \n44.3 \n42.7 \n\n24.6 \n25.8 \n23.3 \n17.7 \n11.2 \n30.7 \n13.9 \n29.5 \n\n37.1 \n38.3 \n38.6 \n34.3 \n36.0 \n20.9 \n43.6 \n20.9 \n43.2 \n29.7 \n42.0 \n34.4 \n\n24.1 \n22.1 \n26.4 \n17.6 \n12.6 \n28.8 \n9.7 \n29.6 \n\n69.3 \n72.6 \n70.5 \n55.5 \n66.4 \n50.9 \n73.1 \n49.0 \n75.5 \n68.1 \n70.3 \n60.3 \n\n54.2 \n51.2 \n57.7 \n53.6 \n39.8 \n57.5 \n30.6 \n61.4 \n\n77.7 \n79.5 \n83.6 \n65.3 \n76.1 \n59.6 \n81.0 \n56.5 \n82.4 \n73.7 \n80.3 \n76.4 \n\n62.5 \n59.2 \n66.2 \n55.5 \n46.2 \n65.5 \n35.5 \n68.6 \n\n81.5 \n83.7 \n88.0 \n71.7 \n79.4 \n63.8 \n84.8 \n67.9 \n85.1 \n76.3 \n84.8 \n79.2 \n\n70.9 \n68.1 \n74.0 \n64.4 \n55.7 \n73.8 \n55.0 \n75.2 \n\n \nHave an account:  \n  All adults \n  Males \n  Females \n  In the labor force \n  Out of the labor force \n  Young adults (percentage aged 15\u201324) \n  Older adults (percentage aged 25+) \n  Primary education or less \n  Secondary education or more \n  Income, poorest 40% \n  Income, richest 60% \n  Rural \n\n22.5 \n23.8 \n27.0 \n10.5 \n21.3 \n15.0 \n26.0 \n10.3 \n28.1 \n19.3 \n24.6 \n22.6 \n\nHave a debit card \n  All adults  \n  Females  \n  Males  \n  Poorest 40%  \n  Young adults (percentage aged 15\u201324)  \n  Older adults (percentage aged 25+)  \n  Primary education or less  \n  Secondary education or more  \n\n20.4 \n19.9 \n21.1 \n19.0 \n13.8 \n23.6 \n9.4 \n25.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nSource: Findex database; note that all numbers are percentages of people aged 15+ of the respective category unless \notherwise indicated.  \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 858 \n \n\nM. Ahunov \n\nTable  11  shows  that  in  2017  only  1%  of  female  and  3.3%  of  male  adults  had  ever \nborrowed  from  a  formal  financial  institution.  These  rates  are  significantly  lower  than \nthose  in  ECA  countries.  Thus,  the  degree  of  financial  exclusion  is  high.  The  CER \n(2013) explained that banks\u2019 supply of consumer loans is low; in 2012 consumer loans \nin  Uzbekistan  constituted  only  2.4%  of  the  GDP  versus  10.2%  for  the  Russian \nFederation  and  6.5%  for  Azerbaijan.  Table  11  also  reports  that  relatives  and  friends  \nare  the  largest  source of  borrowed  funds  relative  to  formal  financial  institutions;  more \nthan 12.1% of female and 13.8% of male respondents declared that they had borrowed \nfrom  friends  and  relatives  in  2017.

The  Findex \nsurvey results show that the proportion of households that save using informal saving \nclubs or persons outside the households is high relative to ECA economies. This in line \nwith  the  CER  (2013),  which  declared  that  only  5%  of  the  aggregated  savings  of \nhouseholds  are  kept  in  bank  deposits.  The  CER  explained  that  this  limits  banks\u2019 \nresource base, which then explains the low supply of loans. The CER (2013) claimed \nthat  the  low  levels  of  saving  are  partly  due  to  the  low  supply  of  attractive  saving \nproducts at the banks; as a result, people either save informally or invest in real estate. \nAdditionally,  Hiwatari  (2010)  and  Kandiyoti  (1998)  reported  that  informal  rotating \nsavings  and  credit  associations  (RSCAs)  among  relatives,  people  in  common \nneighborhoods, or the professional community are popular in Uzbekistan.  \n\nTable 12: Saving Behavior in Uzbekistan \n\n \n \nSaved at a financial institution \n  Female \n  Male \n  Poorest 40% \n  Younger adults \n  Older adults (percentage aged 25+) \n  Primary education or less \n  Secondary education or more \n\nUzbekistan \n2014 \n \n1.6 \n2.1 \n0.8 \n0.6 \n2.4 \n0.8 \n2.3 \n\n2011 \n \n0.5 \n1.1 \n0.7 \n0.0 \n1.2 \n0.6 \n0.9 \n\n2017 \n \n1.6 \n3.1 \n0.7 \n1.1 \n2.8 \n1.2 \n2.8 \n\nEurope and Central Asia \n2017 \n2014 \n2011 \n \n \n \n31.7 \n28.2 \n23.2 \n37.1 \n33.7 \n26.3 \n24.6 \n22.9 \n24.0 \n22.1 \n25.0 \n19.4 \n36.6 \n31.9 \n25.9 \n21.9 \n13.4 \n10.0 \n37.7 \n34.7 \n29.2 \n\nNote: All the numbers are percentages of people aged 15+ of the respective category unless otherwise indicated.  \n\nSource: Findex database. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 858 \n \n\nM. Ahunov \n\nThe  use  of  insurance  services  remains  even  lower  than  the  use  of  banking  services. \nThe Ministry of Finance of Uzbekistan (2017) reported that 26 institutions operate in the \ninsurance  market  of  Uzbekistan,  of  which  23  are  companies  that  provide  general \ninsurance and 3 are life insurance providers. In 2016 the three largest institutions, all of \nwhich  are  state  owned,  controlled  47.4%  of  the  insurance  market  (MFU  2017).  The \ntotal  volume  of  insurance  premiums  collected  in  2016  constituted  629  billion  Uzbek \nsoms (that is, 77.6 million USD, based on the exchange rate 8100 UZS/USD, or 0.12% \nof the GDP). Of the total insurance premiums, 52.2% were collected in the capital city \nTashkent,  with  a  population  of  over  3  million  people,  and  the  rest  came  from  the \nregions (MFU 2017). Thus, the urban\u2013rural gap in the access to and use of insurance \nservices is large. \n\nThe  CER  (2015)  explained  that  Uzbekistan\u2019s  pension  system  consists  of  mandatory \nand  accumulated  pensions.  An  extra-budgetary  pension  fund  runs  the  mandatory \npension, whereas the state-owned bank Halk Bank operates the accumulated pension. \nIn  2013,  according  to  the  CER,  90%  of  pension  funds  were  with  the  extra-budgetary \npension  fund  and  the  rest  were  with  Halk  Bank.  Like  other  former  Soviet  Union \ntransition economies, Uzbekistan has high pension coverage; in 2013 it was 79%. The \nCER (2015) indicated that this is a legacy of the Soviet past, when full employment and \nthus pension coverage were the norm. However, as other similar countries\u2019 coverage is \ndeclining as a result of the structural transformation of the country, with an increasing \nrole of the private sector and declining employment in the public sector, high informality \nexists  (CER  2015).  The  CER  (2015)  also  reported  that  the  basic-level  mandatory \nmonthly  pension  payments  are  set  at  55%  of  the  monthly  average  salary  and  must \nalways be higher than the minimum wage.  \n\n3.2  Financial Inclusion of Micro, Small, Medium-Sized,  \n\nand Large Enterprises  \n\nTable  13  shows  the  overall  increase  in  the  percentage  of  firms  with  a  bank  account: \n97.3%  of  firms  declared  that  they  had  a  bank  account  in  2013  versus  93.8  in  2008. \nBank  account  ownership  is  almost  universal,  independent  of  the  industry,  enterprise \nsize, business location, and gender of the business manager. \n\nIn 2013, 26.4% of firms declared that they had a bank loan or line of credit versus only \n10.5%  in  2008;  thus,  financial  inclusion  has  doubled,  but  it  is  still  low  compared  with \ncountries  with  a  similar  GDP  level  (see  Table  13).  As  Table  13  shows,  the  gaps  in \nhaving  loans/lines  of  credit  are  significant  depending  on  the  establishment  size, \nbusiness  location,  and  exporter  status.  The  proportion  of  firms  is  smaller  for  small \nfirms,  firms  located  in  the  capital  city,  and  non-exporters.  Strikingly,  the  proportion  of \nfirms with a line of credit/loan is independent of the gender of the top manager. Despite \nthese  changes,  the  proportion  of  businesses  that  declared  that  they  needed  no  loan \nhas also doubled. The collateral requirements remain high, as the high percentage of \nloans  that  require  collateral  and  the  value  of  collateral  evidence.  Women-managed \nbusinesses have to give a higher value of collateral than men-managed businesses.  \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 858 \n \n\nM.

Ahunov \n\n4.  BARRIERS TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION \n\nColumn  (a)  of  Table  14  presents  the  major  reasons  for  not  using  formal  financial \nservices  in  Uzbekistan.  The  high  costs  of  financial  services  are  reported  as  the  top \nreason for households not using formal finance in 2014. Indeed, as Figure 3 shows, the \ninterest rates on commercial loans for individuals (panel a) and businesses (panels b \nand c) are high given that the ADB has published figures of 16% inflation and 4% GDP \nper  capita  growth.  Blondel  (2015)  mentioned  that  the  government  policy  to  restrict \naccess  to  cash  and  cash  transactions  translated  into  additional  informal  transaction \ncosts that entrepreneurs had to pay to cash their bank loans in 2015.  \n\nTable 14: Major Reasons for Not Using Formal Financial Services  \nand Reasons for Having No Bank Account \n\n \n\nInsufficient money to use financial institutions \n\n \n1 \n2  Lack of the necessary documentation \n3  Someone else in the family already has an account \n4  Financial institutions are too far away \n5  Financial services are too expensive \n6  Lack of trust in financial institutions \n7  Religious reasons \n\nMajor Reason for  \nNot Using Formal \nFinancial Services  \n(a) \n0.4 \n21 \n30 \n12 \n44 \n10 \n30 \n\nMajor Reason for \nHaving No Bank \nAccount \n(b) \n35.9 \n17.6 \n16.6 \n11.8 \n11.2 \n9.8 \n2.0 \n\nSource: Columns a and b are based on the Findex database from 2014 and 2017, respectively. \n\nImportantly,  private  domestic  and  foreign  banks  charge  relatively  high  interest  rates. \nUntil 2018, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan set the commission fees on the use of bank \ncards  centrally.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  the  amount  of  fees  charged  to \nprivate  individuals  did  not  enable  private  banks  to  offer  their  services  to  private \nindividuals.  However,  in  2018,  the  CBU  started  to  publish  recommended  commission \nfees for the use of bankcards.  \n\nReligious reasons are the second most important reason for people not using financial \nservices.  The  CIA  Factbook  reports  that  88%  of  the  members  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \npopulation are Muslims; however, the banks offer no Islamic banking products.8 This is \npartly  a  legacy  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  and  a  cautious  approach  to  reforms  in \nUzbekistan. In May 2018, a number of news websites announced that, with the support \nof the Islamic Development Bank, the Ministry of Finance was preparing a presidential \ndecree on creating a legislative base and infrastructure to support Islamic finance.9  \n\nA  lack  of  documentation  and  the  inability  to  obtain  an  account  are  the  next  important \nreasons  for  not  using  formal  financial  services.  A  total  of  10%  of  the  respondents \nreported that they do not trust financial institutions. This is in line with the CER (2011), \nwhich  reported,  based  on  a  2010  Uzbekistan  national  survey,  that  78%  of  their \nrespondents indicated that they do not save with banks because they cannot withdraw \ncash when needed.  \n\n                                                 \n8   The  website  of  the  CIA  contains  information  on  the  religious  composition  of  the  Uzbek  population. \nAccessed 3 June 2018. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_uz.html. \n\n9   The  news  website  Gazeta.uz  contains \n\ninformation  on \n\nthis.

Ahunov \n\nFigure 3: Weighted Average Interest Rates on Loans as of May 2018 \n\nSource: Central Bank of Uzbekistan.  \n\n \n\nNote that Findex 2017 asked about the reasons for not having a bank account, which is \ndifferent  from  Findex  2014,  which  asked  about  the  reasons  for  not  using  financial \nservices in general. Therefore, columns (a) and (b) in Table 14 are not comparable. A \nlack of money to use an account, a lack of documentation, the long distance to a bank \nbranch, and the high cost of using a bank account are the major reasons for not using \nformal finance. \n\nTable 15 describes the top reasons for firms not using bank loans/line of credit. They \nranked  high  interest  rates  and  complex  application  procedures  as  the  two  major \nreasons  for not  applying  for  a  formal  loan/line  of  credit.  The  cost  of  borrowing  from  a \nfinancial institution increased between 2008 and 2013. Indeed, Blondel (2015), based \non  a  field  study  in  Uzbekistan,  also  reported  that  entrepreneurs  declared  that  the \npaperwork needed to obtain a loan was among the most difficult.  \n\nTable 15: Top Reasons for Not Using Bank Loans/Lines of Credit \n\n \nHigh interest rates \nComplex application process \nHigh collateral requirements \nInsufficient loan size and maturity \nWon\u2019t be approved \n\nSource: Enterprise surveys.  \n\n2008 \n0.24 \n0.37 \n0.18 \n0.11 \n0.08 \n\n2013 \n0.42 \n0.33 \n0.22 \n0.03 \n0.00 \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 858 \n \n\nM. Ahunov \n\nThe third-largest group, containing 22% of firms, reported high collateral requirements \nas  the  major  reason  behind  their  decision  not  to  use  formal  finance.  Blondel  (2015) \nstated, for the sample of firms that her study covered, that the collateral values ranged \nfrom 130% to 500% of the loan values, with a median of 175%.  \n\n5.  FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION  \n\nThe Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is responsible for the regulation and supervision \nof  commercial  banks  and  microfinance  institutions.10 The  IMF  (2008),  mentioned  that \nthe CBU\u2019s on- and off-site supervision is adequate. The IMF (2008, 2013) reported that \ndirect  intervention  in  commercial  banks\u2019  activity,  through  for  instance,  asking  banks \ndirectly to finance state-owned projects and programs, is widespread, and this hampers \ncompetition among banks.  \n\nMoreover, banks were burdened with the obligation to report clients\u2019 transactions to tax \nand  customs  authorities  and  conduct  financial  oversight  of  the  cash  management  of \nbusiness  entities.  Commercial  banks  thus  had  non-core  functions.  IFC (2006, p. 38) \ngives examples of these based on focus group interviews with entrepreneurs, and we \nlist the ones that are relevant today: \n\n\u2026 Each registered export (barter) contract must be monitored by the authorized \nbank in terms of the operations related to contract enforcement.  \n\n\u2026  in  case of  failure  to receive  the export  earnings  completely  or  goods  within \nthe time frame established by the law (based on the date of border crossing or \ncompletion  of  works),  the  authorized  bank  [must]  inform  the  local  tax  and \ncustoms authorities in writing to take measures according to the law. \n\n\u2026  upon  the  request  of  the  tax  authorities  the  banks  must  provide  the \ntransaction  data  of  their  customers  required  for  monitoring  the  integrity  and \ncompleteness of all due tax payments. \n\nAll  these  non-core  functions  destroyed  the  trust  in  banks  and  increased  their  costs. \nDirect intervention in pricing loans and the presence of state direct loans also damaged \nbanks\u2019 risk management practices. \n\nIn addition, the CBU maintained a heavily overvalued UZS exchange rate by restricting \nthe  availability  of  foreign  currency  to  finance  imports;  it  also  required  exporters  of \ncotton  and  gold  to  sell  100%  of  their  foreign  currency  earnings  at  this  distorted \nexchange rate. It required other exporters to sell 50% of their foreign currency earnings \nat a  distorted price (IMF 2000, 2008, 2013). Small businesses and private individuals \nthus  have  had  restricted  access  to  international  payment  instruments  and  foreign \ncurrency, which then created an unofficial black market for  foreign currency. Figure 4 \nshows that, until the second quarter of 2017, the gap between the official and the black \nmarket exchange rate widened. From September 2017, the Government of Uzbekistan \nliberalized  the  access  to  foreign  exchange  and  devalued  Uzbek  soms  twice,  which \nnarrowed this gap.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10  Law  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  on  \u201cBanks  and  Banking\u201d.

Article  28  states  that  all  financial  service \nproviders  need  to  insure  their  liabilities  for  the  case  of  bankruptcy  or  liquidation.  This \narticle  also  requires  financial  service  providers  to  inform  their  customers  about  the \nexistence  of  insurance.  The  main  organization  for  implementing  this  law  is  the  State \nCommittee  on  Privatization,  Demonopolization  and  Promotion  of  Competition  and \nAgency Uzbek Standard. In addition, from the start of 2017, the Office of the President \nof  Uzbekistan  started  to  receive  direct  complaints  from  individuals  on  all  kinds  of  \nissues through hotline and online channels. In one period, this office received over one \nmillion complaints, and the fifth-largest number of complaints addressed the CBU and \ncommercial banks.11 Financial deepening will thus require a more rigorous approach to \nconsumer protection than is necessary now. \n\nUzbekistan has had explicit deposit insurance that covers all the banks in the country \nsince  2002.  Initially  the  deposit  insurance  was  partial.  However,  since  28  November \n2008, a new Presidential Decree has announced a blanket guarantee on deposits, and \nsince October 2009 it has been replaced by a statutory limit of 250 times the minimum \nwage  (Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt,  Kane,  and  Laeven  2014).  Note  that,  in  December  2017,  the \nminimum  wage  for  2018  was  172,240  UZS,  which  is  approximately  21  USD  at  the \nexchange  rate  8,000  UZS/USD.

FINANCIAL LITERACY AND EDUCATION  \n\nAssessing  the  level  of  financial  literacy  in  Uzbekistan  is  a  challenge  due  to  missing \nmicro-data.  The  only  evidence  comes  from  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  2014  Global  Financial \nLiteracy  Survey,  which  only  published  aggregated  results.

However,  the \nSparkassen-Finanzgruppe  reported  that,  jointly  with  the  ministries  of  Uzbekistan,  \nit  had  developed  such  plan,  which  was  pending  ratification.  On  its  website,  the \nSparkassen-Finanzgruppe reported13:  \n\nBased  on  an  analysis  of  general  financial  literacy  in  Uzbekistan,  a  gender-\nspecific  national  strategy  was  developed  to  raise  the  level  of  basic  financial \neducation  of  the  Uzbek  population. This  5-year  strategy  details  the  objectives, \nstructures,  methods  and  target  groups  of  financial  education  in  Uzbekistan. \nFurthermore,  a  two-year  action  plan  was  devised,  listing  specific  activities, \nresponsibilities,  a  timeframe  and  budget  for  the  strategy\u2019s  implementation. \nSparkassenstiftung completed all of this work by the close of 2016. In all, some \n13  Uzbek  ministries  and  institutions helped  co-design  the  action  roadmap  and \nthe financial and cost plans as well as the monitoring concept. Project activities \nfor the year under review also include several further training inputs for different \nactors.  Courses  for  local  trainers  featuring  simulations  for  financial  budget \nplanning and the promotion of small-scale enterprises have proven particularly \nsuccessful in this context. Despite the delay in the adoption of a gender-specific \nstrategy  due  to  the  elections  of  December  2016,  the  project  is  continuing  to \nmeet the high demand for its further training measures. \n\n                                                 \n13  Information on this is available from the website of Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe.

Ahunov \n\nIn May 2017, the CBU reported that, jointly with the International Finance Corporation \n(part of World Bank Group), the Association of Banks of Uzbekistan, and the Chamber \nof  Commerce  of  Uzbekistan,  it  had  started  to  implement  a  new  program  on  financial \nliteracy.  The  program  consists  of  two  parts:  the  first  targets  owners  of  small  and \nmedium-sized  businesses,  and  the second  aims  to  educate  the  general  population.  It  \nis  not  clear  whether  the  financial  literacy  program  will  be  included  in  the  school \ncurriculum.  Importantly,  this  is  not  the  first  financial  literacy  program. 14 A  few  other \nprograms  exist,  like  the  German  Agency  GIZ  project,  within  which  the  Sparkassen-\nFinanzgruppe  currently  also  focuses  on  financial  literacy;  for  instance,  the  program \noperates  a  train  the  trainer  program  with  a  state  financial  institute.  Additionally,  the \nNational Association of Microfinance Institutions of Uzbekistan, in partnership with the \nMicrofinance  Centre,  has  implemented  a  finance  literacy  program  by  directly  training \n633  low-income  people  and  preparing  34  trainers  on  financial  literacy.  However,  the \nscale  of  the  current  programs  is  small,  and  no  assessment  is  available  to  judge  the \nimpact of these programs on financial literacy.  \n\nIn  addition  to  low  financial  literacy,  the  degree  of  independent  decision  making  with \nregard  to  saving  and  borrowing  can  affect  the  access  to  finance  in  Uzbekistan. \nTable 16  shows  that  almost  one-fourth  of  adults  reported  that  someone  else  makes \ntheir financial decisions. \n\nTable 16: Who Makes the Decisions about the Savings, Investment,  \nand Borrowing in Your Household? \n\n \nShared equally between me and my partner \nMostly me \nShared equally between me and someone else in the household \n\n \nMostly my partner \nMostly someone else in the household \nMostly someone else not in the household \n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates based on the Life in Transition Survey 3. \n\nMale \n32.39 \n28.87 \n13.91 \n75.20 \n14.08 \n10.21 \n0.53 \n24.83 \n\nFemale \n37.85 \n27.69 \n11.38 \n76.90 \n10.77 \n12.00 \n0.31 \n23.08 \n\nTotal \n34.38 \n28.44 \n12.99 \n75.80 \n12.88 \n10.86 \n0.45 \n24.19 \n\n7.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATION  \n\nThis  chapter  demonstrates  that  household  and  firm  financial  inclusion  in  Uzbekistan \nremains  low.  First,  the  majority  of  households,  rather  than  using  formal  finance,  save \nand borrow informally. Low-income households have less access to finance than their \npeers in high-income groups. Although most households are increasingly using a bank \naccount,  few  borrow/save  with  a  formal  financial  institution.  Pension  coverage  is  high \nbut  mainly  limited  to  public  sector  employment;  people  employed  informally  have  no \npension  coverage.  The  use  of  insurance  services  is  even  lower.  Internet  and  mobile \npayments have spiked in recent years; however, the usage level remains low relative to \nthat  in  other  countries,  like  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India,  and  the  Russian \nFederation.  Almost  all  firms  use  a  bank  account,  but  few  borrow  from  a  financial \ninstitution.  Few  firms  use  e-payments.  The  low  banking  sector  penetration  rate  in \n\n                                                 \n14  Information  on  this  is  available  on  the  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  website.  Accessed  4  June  2018. \n\nhttp://www.cbu.uz/ru/press-tsentr/press-relizy/2017/11/95839/. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 858 \n \n\nM. Ahunov \n\nUzbekistan relative to countries with a similar level of development also suggests that \nfinancial  inclusion  is  low.  Uzbekistan  thus  needs  to  increase  the  level  of  financial \ninclusion for firms and households to achieve equitable and rapid growth of income per \ncapita, which is one of the key goals of all economic reforms.  \n\nSurvey-based  evidence  suggests  that  both  households  and  firms  indicated  the  high \ncost of using finance as the top reason for not using it. As the second most important \nreason  for  not  using  formal  finance,  households  declared  that  religious  reasons  stop \nthem  from  using  formal  finance.  Indeed,  given  that  88%  of  the  members  of  the \npopulation of Uzbekistan are Muslims, the fact that no banks offer an Islamic banking \nproduct indicates a clear gap in the supply. Unlike households, firms reported that the \ncomplex  application  procedures  and  high  collateral  requirements  are  the  second  and \nthird most important reasons for not using formal finance. These reasons thus suggest \nthat financial inclusion in Uzbekistan is mainly constrained by supply-side factors. \n\nOn  the  supply  side,  the  financial  system  is  highly  concentrated,  with  five  commercial \nbanks controlling more than half of the banking sector assets. This is in line with Beck, \nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2004), who, based on a comparison of international \nevidence,  concluded  that,  in  countries  with  higher  banking  concentration,  firms  face \ngreater  obstacles  in  accessing  finance.  All  these  large  banks  are  state  owned  and \nmainly focus on financing government-led projects and programs. The lending rate for \nthese  state  projects  is  often  below  the  market  rate,  which  undermines  the  risk \nmanagement  practices  of  banks  and  limits  the  availability  of  finance  to  the  private \nsector. The limited supply of finance to the private sector and limited competition in the \nsector  make  finance  expensive  for  private-sector  players  and  constrain  financial \ninnovation.  This  is  in  line  with  Beck,  Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt,  and  Maksimovic  (2004),  who \nreported  that  state  ownership  of  banks  and  direct  intervention  in  banking  activities \nworsen access to finance.  \n\nStrikingly,  although  the  level  of  financial  inclusion  is  low,  the  country  has  no  financial \ninclusion  strategy,  and,  even  more  surprisingly,  we  detected  no  ongoing  discussions \nabout such a document. The first policy recommendation, therefore, is that the country \nneeds to formulate a national financial inclusion strategy to enable a strategic approach \nto  the  matter.  Second,  based  on  international  experience,  it  should  promote  private  \nand  foreign  capital  participation  in  banking,  insurance,  and  other  segments  of  the \nfinancial  markets.  Third,  financial  liberalization,  which  has  accelerated  since  2017, \nthough  removing  most  of  the  restrictions  in  access  to  foreign  exchange,  needs  to \ncontinue;  market-based  interest  rates  and  commission  fees  on  financial  services  are \nessential for the efficiency and inclusiveness of the system.  \n\nThe  liberalization  of  the  banking  system  will  also  require  the  Central  Bank  of \nUzbekistan  to  move  towards  the  use  of  market-based  instruments  to  regulate  and \nsupervise  financial  institutions:  the  current  heavy  reliance  on  the  use  on  non-market-\nbased instruments needs to cease. The regulator, to foster competition among financial \ninstitutions,  may  also  want  to  license  fintech  and  telecom  companies  and  promote  \nthe  legal  framework  to  enable  peer-to-peer  lending.  At  the  practical  level,  promoting \nnon-conventional  financial  institutions  and  products  might  not  be  an  easy  task.  For \nsuch  cases,  countries  like  Singapore  and  others  have  devised  clear  procedures  that \nfinancial institutions can apply for a regulatory sandbox.15 As the Consultative Group to \nAssist  the  Poor (CGAP)  explained,  a  regulatory  sandbox  is  \u201ca  framework  set  up  by  a \n\n                                                 \n15  Information on the procedures to apply a Fintech regulatory sandbox in Singapore is available from the \nwebsite  of  the  Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore.

Ahunov \n\nregulator that allows FinTech startups and other innovators to conduct live experiments \nin a controlled environment under a regulator\u2019s supervision.\u201d16  \n\nThe  promotion  of  financial  inclusion  might  occur  through  the  use  of  digital  finance, \nincluding  the  promotion  of  mobile  and  Internet  banking.  To  encourage  these  in \nadditional to financial liberalization and the use of market-based tools of regulation and \nsupervision,  the  Government  needs  to  facilitate  infrastructure  development,  like  the \ncreation of remote identification facilities.  \n\nThe  country  needs  to  improve  its  financial  consumer  protection.  The  current \ninstitutional structure, which pools financial and general consumer protection together, \nmay  not  provide  adequate  safeguards.  Rutledge  (2010),  based  on  six  transition \neconomies, explained that the financial crises of 2008 and 2009 demonstrated that the \nsustainability  of  financial  systems  is  highly  dependent  on  the  existence  of  adequate \nconsumer protection. Rutledge also explained that such protection should put systems \nin  place  that  ensure  that  consumers  make  fully  informed  decisions  when  deciding  to \nbuy  financial  services  and  while  using  them  along  with  easy  and  provide  less  costly \nmechanisms for settling conflicts with financial institutions. Finally, consumers need to \nhave access to resources that enable them to gain financial education in any form and \nat the most convenient time. To achieve this, the Government needs to adjust the Law \non  \u201cConsumer  Protection\u201d  to  fit  the  specific  needs  of  financial  services.  Moreover, \ninstitution wise, the country needs specific institutions that focus on financial consumer \nprotection.  \n\nThe  evidence  on  the  level  of  financial  literacy  in  Uzbekistan  remains  limited.  The \navailable  sources  imply  that  the  level  of  financial  literacy  is  low.  The  existing  studies, \nlike  that  by  Klapper,  Lusardi,  and  Panos  (2013),  have  suggested,  based  on  the \nRussian Federation, that financially literate people are more likely to use formal finance \nrather  than  informal  finance  compared  with  financially  illiterate  people;  the  ability  of \nindividuals  to  avoid  negative  income  shocks  and  have  higher  spending  capacity \nincreases with their level of financial literacy. Thus, to promote financial inclusion, the \ncountry needs to promote financial literacy. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16  Website of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor.

Both  indicate  the  high  cost  of  finance  as  the  top  reason  for  not  using  it. \nSecondly,  households,  which  are  mostly  Muslim,  declare  that  religious  reasons  prevent  \nthem from using formal finance, as only conventional finance is available. Unlike households, \nfirms  report  that  complex  application  procedures  and  high  collateral  requirements  are  the \nsecond and third most important reasons for not using formal finance. Financial inclusion is \ntherefore constrained on the supply side. Policy recommendations include: promoting private \nand  foreign  capital  participation  in  all  segments  of  finance;  removing/limiting  the  use  of  \ndirect  interest  rate  controls  and  administrative  policy  tools;  and  facilitating  infrastructure \ndevelopment  to  promote  digital  finance.  Demand-side  policies,  like  improving  financial \nliteracy  and  customer  protection,  are  necessary  to  supplement  these  policies.  Strikingly,  \nthe  country  needs  to  create  a  financial  inclusion  and  education  strategy  that  will  enable  \nbetter-coordinated actions, leading to sustainable results. \n \nKeywords: access to finance, obstacles, liberalization, financial literacy, customer protection  \n \nJEL Classification: G21, G28, L22, O16 \n \n", " \n"]}
