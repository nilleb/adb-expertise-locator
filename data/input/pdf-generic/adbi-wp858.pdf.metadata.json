INTRODUCTION \nIn his speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization in 2017, the \nPresident of Uzbekistan, as one of his key messages, outlined an important principle: \n\u201cthe wealthier are the people, the stronger is the state.\u201d1 Promoting financial inclusion, \nthat is, providing people with access to payment services, savings accounts, loans, and \ninsurance at a reasonable cost, might be instrumental in achieving this goal. Recent \nevidence from around the world has shown that financial inclusion can contribute to \ninclusive growth and economic development (Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Singer 2017). This \nchapter therefore aims to assess the state of financial inclusion in Uzbekistan as of \n2018 and to identify the obstacles and the opportunities to promote it.  \nThis chapter uses a nationally representative household survey, the Life in Transition \nSurvey Wave 3, which the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment (EBRD) administered in 2016. It also uses a firm-level survey called the \nBusiness Environment Survey, which the World Bank conducted in 2013. The World \nBank also administered the Global Findex Survey among a representative number  \nof individuals in Uzbekistan in 2008 and 2014. The study further uses a range of \nsecondary data from the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU), the World Bank, and the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) along with findings from local studies. These are all \nthe most recent sources available on this research topic.  \n2.  OVERVIEW OF UZBEKISTAN\u2019S FINANCIAL SYSTEM  \nUzbekistan\u2019s financial system is bank based, with commercial banks playing a key role. \nThe other types of financial intermediaries that operate in this market are non-deposit-\ntaking microfinance institutions. These play little or no role. Similarly, no formal crowd \nfinance platform exists, and the financial markets are underdeveloped. The level of \nfinancial intermediation has traditionally been low, as the relatively low banking sector \ncredit to GDP ratio compared with other transition economies evidences (see Figure 1). \nHowever, with the new President, the country made significant progress in financial \nliberalization between 2016 and 2018. As a result, financial intermediation has surged; \nin 2018, as the Central Bank of Uzbekistan reported, the banking sector credit to GDP \nratio was 42.2% versus 26% and 19.4%, respectively, in 2016 and 2012.  \nTable 1 shows that the importance of deposits as a source of funds declined between \n2017 and 2018. Thus, the direct borrowing of commercial banks mainly from state \nfunds and to a lesser extent from international credit lines funded the surge in bank \nlending that the CBU (2018) explained. The CBU (2018) reported that, between 2017 \nand 2018, the share of borrowed funds of commercial banks in their total liabilities \nincreased from 36% to 50%. Table 1 indicates that the share of deposits in the total \nliabilities decreased from 48% to 40% between 2017 and 2018. As Table 1 shows, \ndemand deposits dominated, making up more than half of the total deposits. Only 9.2% \nof deposits had a maturity of one year and more. The funding structure of commercial \nbanks is indicative of two issues: low depositor confidence in banking and the presence \nof tight constraints on banks\u2019 ability to extend loans, especially for long-term periods.  \n \n                                                 \n1  President  Shavkat  Mirziyoev\u2019s  speech  is  available  from  the  online  newspaper  Gazeta.uz. \nhttps://www.gazeta.uz/ru/2017/09/20/un-ga-speech/ (accessed 29 May 2018). \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 858  M. Ahunov \n \nFigure 1: Banking Sector Credit to GDP Ratio in Transition Economies in 2016 \n \nSource: IMF Financial Access Survey. \nTable 1: Banking Sector Deposits \n2017  2018 \n \nAll deposits as a percentage of bank liabilities  48  40 \nDemand deposits  54.0  51.9 \nSaving deposits with maturity      \n1 to 30 days  5.5  5.5 \n30 to 180 days  17.2  17.5 \n180 to 365 days  10.4  15.8 \n1 year and more  12.9  9.2 \nForeign currency deposits  27.5  49.1 \nNote: All numbers are given as of 1 January of the corresponding year. \nSource: Central Bank of Uzbekistan. \nTable 2 shows that banks with state ownership dominate (see Table 2). In 2018, 11 out \nof 28 banks had direct or indirect state ownership. All these 11 banks jointly controlled \nover 82% of the total banking sector assets, over 66% and 88%, respectively, of the \ndeposit and loan market shares as of 1 January 2018 (CBU 2018). This is in line with \n2012, as the ADB (2014) noted, declaring that state-owned banks controlled 86.8% of \nthe total loan portfolio and 69.4% of all deposits. The market share of state-owned \nbanks in deposit markets has thus been declining.  \nAs  the  IMF (2013)  reported,  state-owned  banks  mainly  finance  large  government \nprograms and projects. The lending rate in these state-led projects is often below the \nmarket rate, which impedes banks\u2019 risk management and leads to segmentation of the \nbanking market. For instance, the IMF (2018) stated:  \nUzbekistan\u2019s  credit  market  is  highly  segmented,  with  SOEs  [state-owned \nenterprises] enjoying preferential access to credit. The FX segment of the credit \nmarket is dominated by SOEs, which receive FX credit either directly from state \nbanks  or  through  on-lending  operations  by  government  entities  ...  These \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 858  M. Ahunov \n \ndirected FX credits are often granted at highly preferential terms, depressing \nbanks\u2019 profitability. By contrast, the private sector is largely confined to the \ndomestic currency segment of the credit market, where loan mark-ups may in \npart reflect banks\u2019 attempt to recoup low margins on concessional lending. \nAll state banks specialize in a specific sector and mostly channel state funds. The IMF \n(2018)  declared  that  56%  of  its  total  loans  have  been  extended  to  state-owned \nenterprises and joint ventures. Similarly, the deposits and loans of the Government \nconstitute 51% of the liabilities of banks. The IMF also reported that state-owned \nenterprises\u2019 deposits make up 13% of banking sector liabilities. Thus, banks mainly \nintermediate between different government-owned enterprises and funds. Each state-\nowned bank has a specific function. For instance, the National Bank of Uzbekistan for \nForeign Economic Activity, the largest bank in the country, specializes, as its name \nsuggests, in financing foreign trade and export facilitation programs. Similarly, the \nPeople\u2019s Bank, which controlled 3.3% of the banking market share in 2018, is the main \nstate bank for social payments and pensions and for serving public sector payments. \nTable 2: Uzbekistan\u2019s Banking System Ownership and Concentration \n  Market Share (Percentage of Banking \nAssets) \n2001  2014  2016  2018 \nMarket share of top three banks   86.6  50.6  49.7  59.9 \nMarket share of top five banks   91.3  63.7  62.9  71.8 \nState-owned banks  82.2  41.2  41.4  48.8 \nShareholding banks with indirect state ownership  6.1  35.5  33.7  33.2 \nBanks with foreign ownership  0.9  8.7  9.9  7.7 \nSource: We estimated the market shares using CBU data. \nAs Table 2 also shows, Uzbekistan\u2019s banking sector is highly concentrated. The three \nlargest banks jointly controlled 59.9% of the total banking assets in 2018 versus 86.6% \nin  2001.  Thus,  concentration  has  been  declining.  In  2001,  the  National  Bank  of \nUzbekistan alone controlled 76% of the total banking sector assets versus 30.9% as of \n1 January 2018. The NBU is still the largest bank, controlling 19.5% and 18.5% of the \ndeposit and loan market shares in 2018.  \nForeign bank penetration remains low. As Table 2 shows, banks with foreign ownership \njointly controlled 7.7% of the total banking sector assets in 2018. Unlike the situation in \nother transition economies, like Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland, banks with foreign \nownership  first  entered  the  country  by  creating  a  new  institution,  that  is,  through \n\u201cgreenfield investments.\u201d The market share of these banks has been small; according \nto the CBU, it is below 1%, and they have limited their activity to financing businesses \nfrom their home countries. The other three banks with foreign ownership resulted from \ncross-border takeovers, and these control around 9% of the banking sector assets. \nTable 2 shows that the share of banks with no state ownership increased from 0.8%  \nof the banking sector assets in 2001 to 13% in 2018. Unlike their peers with state \nownership, these banks mainly deal with private sector deposits and loans. Note that \nthe number of private banks has been stable, and this is possibly due to the strict \nlicensing  regulations  for  the  entry  of  new  private  banks,  as  Ruziev  and  Ghosh  \n(2009) noted. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 858  M.

All figures are as of 1 January of the respective year.  \nAccording to the CBU (2018), almost all the banks in Uzbekistan have a credit ranking \nfrom international institutions like Moody\u2019s and Fitch, and they are all ranked as stable.2 \nThis is in line with the IMF (2000, 2008, 2013). The high level of capitalization was due \nto direct state capital injections into state-owned banks (IMF 2013).  \nFigure 2: Domestic Credit and Gross Domestic Product per Capita \n \nSource: World Development Indicators database. \nTable 3 also reports the key financial performance indicators of the Uzbek banking \nsystem. The regulatory bank capital to risk-adjusted asset ratio, profitability indicators \nsuch  as  return  on  assets,  and  equity  are  high  and  improving;  the  level  of  \nnon-performing  loans  is  low.  Thus,  credit  rationing  seems  to  be  relatively  high  in \nUzbekistan judging from the level of domestic credit to the private sector, which is well \nbelow the average compared with countries with a similar level of development, as \nFigure 2 shows. \n                                                 \n2  Information on credit rankings is available on the Central Bank of Uzbekistan\u2019s website.

Ahunov \n \nAs  mentioned  earlier,  Uzbekistan  has  no  deposit-taking  microfinance  institutions,  \nsuch as credit unions, like the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have. The Credit Union \nLaw came into force in 2002 and led to the rapid entry of new institutions into the \nfinancial market: the number of credit unions surged from 20 in 2004 to 163 in 2010 \n(see Table 3). However, deposit-taking microfinance institutions ceased existence in \n2010 with the reversal of the law; they were all turned into non-deposit-taking financial \ninstitutions that lend their own funds. The evidence on the quality of credit union \nservices  is  mixed.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  credit  unions  have  been \nsuccessful in promoting access to finance among micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises (ADB 2009). On the contrary, the Centre for Economic Research (2011) \n(hereafter: CER), based on the National Income Mobilization Survey, which claims to \nbe  a  nationally  representative  survey,  reported  that  in  2010  50%  of  respondents \ncomplained about a delay in accessing their deposits at credit unions and 26% of \nclients declared that the credit union interest rates were high.  \nTable 4: Geographic Outreach of Financial Institutions in Uzbekistan \nIndicator Name  2004  2006  2008  2010  2012  2014  2016  2018 \nNumber of:                  \n Commercial banks  31  28  30  31  29  26  27  28 \n Non-deposit-taking microfin. inst.  1  14  60  93  76  71  76  76 \nCommercial bank branches/mini banks/units:                 \n Number   6,701  7,627  7,712  7,900  8,058  8,237  8,263  8,864 \n Branches per 100,000 adults  39.1  42.3  40.7  39.2  38.0  37.4  36.1  27.7 \n Branches per 1000 km2  15.8  18.0  18.2  18.6  19.0  19.4  19.5  19.8 \nAutomated teller machines (ATMs):                 \n Number   151  171  318  807  1,417  1,870  4,954   \n ATMs per 100,000 adults  0.9  0.9  1.7  4.0  6.7  8.5  21.6   \n ATMs per 1000 km2  0.4  0.4  0.7  1.9  3.3  4.4  11.6   \nSource: International Monetary Fund, Financial Access Database. \nTable 4 shows that the banking sector outreach surged between 2004 and 2018, as the \nincrease in the number of ATMs per 100,000 adults and per 1000 km2 evidences.

STATUS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION  \n3.1  Financial Inclusion of Households \nUzbekistan, as Yoshino and Morgan (2016) also noted, is among the countries with a \nlow bank account penetration rate; according to the 2014 Findex survey, only 26% of \npeople aged 15 and older held an account with a financial institution. Beck and Brown \n(2011), based on the nationally representative sample of the Life in Transition Survey \n2, which the EBRD and the World Bank administered in 2010, listed Uzbekistan among \nthe transition countries with a low level of banking service use. However, the 2017 \nFindex  survey  reported  that  37%  of  people  aged  15  and  older  had  an  account;  \nthus,  the  account  penetration  had  increased  but  remained  low.

The World Bank World \nDevelopment  Indicators  database  shows  that  the  account  penetration  rate  in \nUzbekistan is higher than in countries with a similar level of GDP per capita. The major \ndriver behind bank card use is the legislation requiring organizations and state-owned \ncompanies to pay salaries through a transfer to a bank card. For instance, the ADB \n(2014) reported that the most common method of paying salaries in the formal sector is \nthrough direct transfers to employees\u2019 bank cards; this is a result of the government \npolicy  aimed  at  reducing  money  out  of  bank  circulation  and  deepening  non-cash \npayments. As a result, more than 19 million bank cards were in use as of January 2017 \nversus  only  32  thousand  in  1999.6 Similarly,  according  to  the  Central  Bank  of \nUzbekistan, the total amount of transactions using bank cards reached 53,050 billion \nUzbek soms (6.5 billion United States dollars) in January 2016 as opposed to 0.1 billion \nUzbek soms in 2004.  \nTable 7 shows a surge in Internet and mobile use in Uzbekistan. The number of \nInternet banking users increased from 0.4% of depositors in 2011 to 2.3% in 2017. The \nuse of mobile banking increased from 0.3% of depositors in 2011 to 32.8% in 2017. \nThe CER (2015) reported that the surge in electronic banking products was a result of \nthe regulatory changes. Table 8 shows that most of the laws on the use of information \nresources and systems, electronic signatures, and commerce came into force from \n2004. An important milestone in the development of electronic payments was the \nCommon Republican Processing Centre\u2019s and e-payment company Click\u2019s introduction \nof the mobile payment system. As the CER (2015) stated, the adoption of the law on \nelectronic payments provided a strong impetus for the development of the system. \nHowever, mobile banking and Internet banking have considerable room to improve. \nFirst, the CBU reported that payments for utility services, like the gas and electricity \n                                                 \n5  Information on this is available from the website of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan.

These rates are significantly lower than \nthose in ECA countries. Thus, the degree of financial exclusion is high. The CER \n(2013) explained that banks\u2019 supply of consumer loans is low; in 2012 consumer loans \nin  Uzbekistan  constituted  only  2.4%  of  the  GDP  versus  10.2%  for  the  Russian \nFederation and 6.5% for Azerbaijan.

The Findex \nsurvey results show that the proportion of households that save using informal saving \nclubs or persons outside the households is high relative to ECA economies. This in line \nwith  the  CER  (2013),  which  declared  that  only  5%  of  the  aggregated  savings  of \nhouseholds  are  kept  in  bank  deposits.  The  CER  explained  that  this  limits  banks\u2019 \nresource base, which then explains the low supply of loans. The CER (2013) claimed \nthat the low levels of saving are partly due to the low supply of attractive saving \nproducts at the banks; as a result, people either save informally or invest in real estate. \nAdditionally,  Hiwatari  (2010)  and  Kandiyoti  (1998)  reported  that  informal  rotating \nsavings  and  credit  associations  (RSCAs)  among  relatives,  people  in  common \nneighborhoods, or the professional community are popular in Uzbekistan.  \nTable 12: Saving Behavior in Uzbekistan \nUzbekistan  Europe and Central Asia \n \n2011  2014  2017  2011  2014  2017 \n \nSaved at a financial institution             \n Female  0.5  1.6  1.6  23.2  28.2  31.7 \n Male  1.1  2.1  3.1  26.3  33.7  37.1 \n Poorest 40%  0.7  0.8  0.7  24.0  22.9  24.6 \n Younger adults  0.0  0.6  1.1  19.4  25.0  22.1 \n Older adults (percentage aged 25+)  1.2  2.4  2.8  25.9  31.9  36.6 \n Primary education or less  0.6  0.8  1.2  10.0  13.4  21.9 \n Secondary education or more  0.9  2.3  2.8  29.2  34.7  37.7 \nNote: All the numbers are percentages of people aged 15+ of the respective category unless otherwise indicated.  \nSource: Findex database. \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 858  M.

In 2016 the three largest institutions, all of \nwhich are state owned, controlled 47.4% of the insurance market (MFU 2017). The \ntotal volume of insurance premiums collected in 2016 constituted 629 billion Uzbek \nsoms (that is, 77.6 million USD, based on the exchange rate 8100 UZS/USD, or 0.12% \nof the GDP). Of the total insurance premiums, 52.2% were collected in the capital city \nTashkent, with a population of over 3 million people, and the rest came from the \nregions (MFU 2017). Thus, the urban\u2013rural gap in the access to and use of insurance \nservices is large. \nThe CER (2015) explained that Uzbekistan\u2019s pension system consists of mandatory \nand  accumulated  pensions.  An  extra-budgetary  pension  fund  runs  the  mandatory \npension, whereas the state-owned bank Halk Bank operates the accumulated pension. \nIn 2013, according to the CER, 90% of pension funds were with the extra-budgetary \npension  fund  and  the  rest  were  with  Halk  Bank.  Like  other  former  Soviet  Union \ntransition economies, Uzbekistan has high pension coverage; in 2013 it was 79%. The \nCER (2015) indicated that this is a legacy of the Soviet past, when full employment and \nthus pension coverage were the norm. However, as other similar countries\u2019 coverage is \ndeclining as a result of the structural transformation of the country, with an increasing \nrole of the private sector and declining employment in the public sector, high informality \nexists  (CER  2015).  The  CER  (2015)  also  reported  that  the  basic-level  mandatory \nmonthly pension payments are set at 55% of the monthly average salary and must \nalways be higher than the minimum wage.  \n3.2  Financial Inclusion of Micro, Small, Medium-Sized,  \nand Large Enterprises  \nTable 13 shows the overall increase in the percentage of firms with a bank account: \n97.3% of firms declared that they had a bank account in 2013 versus 93.8 in 2008. \nBank account ownership is almost universal, independent of the industry, enterprise \nsize, business location, and gender of the business manager. \nIn 2013, 26.4% of firms declared that they had a bank loan or line of credit versus only \n10.5% in 2008; thus, financial inclusion has doubled, but it is still low compared with \ncountries with a similar GDP level (see Table 13). As Table 13 shows, the gaps in \nhaving  loans/lines  of  credit  are  significant  depending  on  the  establishment  size, \nbusiness location, and exporter status. The proportion of firms is smaller for small \nfirms, firms located in the capital city, and non-exporters. Strikingly, the proportion of \nfirms with a line of credit/loan is independent of the gender of the top manager. Despite \nthese changes, the proportion of businesses that declared that they needed no loan \nhas also doubled. The collateral requirements remain high, as the high percentage of \nloans that require collateral and the value of collateral evidence. Women-managed \nbusinesses have to give a higher value of collateral than men-managed businesses.  \n   \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 858  M.

The high costs of financial services are reported as the top \nreason for households not using formal finance in 2014. Indeed, as Figure 3 shows, the \ninterest rates on commercial loans for individuals (panel a) and businesses (panels b \nand c) are high given that the ADB has published figures of 16% inflation and 4% GDP \nper capita growth. Blondel (2015) mentioned that the government policy to restrict \naccess to cash and cash transactions translated into additional informal transaction \ncosts that entrepreneurs had to pay to cash their bank loans in 2015.  \nTable 14: Major Reasons for Not Using Formal Financial Services  \nand Reasons for Having No Bank Account \nMajor Reason for   Major Reason for \nNot Using Formal  Having No Bank \nFinancial Services   Account \n    (a)  (b) \n1  Insufficient money to use financial institutions  0.4  35.9 \n2  Lack of the necessary documentation  21  17.6 \n3  Someone else in the family already has an account  30  16.6 \n4  Financial institutions are too far away  12  11.8 \n5  Financial services are too expensive  44  11.2 \n6  Lack of trust in financial institutions  10  9.8 \n7  Religious reasons  30  2.0 \nSource: Columns a and b are based on the Findex database from 2014 and 2017, respectively. \nImportantly, private domestic and foreign banks charge relatively high interest rates. \nUntil 2018, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan set the commission fees on the use of bank \ncards  centrally.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  the  amount  of  fees  charged  to \nprivate  individuals  did  not  enable  private  banks  to  offer  their  services  to  private \nindividuals. However, in 2018, the CBU started to publish recommended commission \nfees for the use of bankcards.  \nReligious reasons are the second most important reason for people not using financial \nservices.  The  CIA  Factbook  reports  that  88%  of  the  members  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \npopulation are Muslims; however, the banks offer no Islamic banking products.8 This is \npartly a legacy of the former Soviet Union and a cautious approach to reforms in \nUzbekistan. In May 2018, a number of news websites announced that, with the support \nof the Islamic Development Bank, the Ministry of Finance was preparing a presidential \ndecree on creating a legislative base and infrastructure to support Islamic finance.9  \nA lack of documentation and the inability to obtain an account are the next important \nreasons for not using formal financial services. A total of 10% of the respondents \nreported that they do not trust financial institutions. This is in line with the CER (2011), \nwhich  reported,  based  on  a  2010  Uzbekistan  national  survey,  that  78%  of  their \nrespondents indicated that they do not save with banks because they cannot withdraw \ncash when needed.  \n                                                 \n8  The website of the CIA contains information on the religious composition of the Uzbek population. \nAccessed 3 June 2018. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_uz.html. \n9  The  news  website  Gazeta.uz  contains  information  on  this.

FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION  \nThe Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is responsible for the regulation and supervision \nof commercial banks and microfinance institutions.10 The IMF (2008), mentioned that \nthe CBU\u2019s on- and off-site supervision is adequate. The IMF (2008, 2013) reported that \ndirect intervention in commercial banks\u2019 activity, through for instance, asking banks \ndirectly to finance state-owned projects and programs, is widespread, and this hampers \ncompetition among banks.  \nMoreover, banks were burdened with the obligation to report clients\u2019 transactions to tax \nand customs authorities and conduct financial oversight of the cash management of \nbusiness entities. Commercial banks thus had non-core functions. IFC (2006, p. 38) \ngives examples of these based on focus group interviews with entrepreneurs, and we \nlist the ones that are relevant today: \n\u2026 Each registered export (barter) contract must be monitored by the authorized \nbank in terms of the operations related to contract enforcement.  \n\u2026 in case of failure to receive the export earnings completely or goods within \nthe time frame established by the law (based on the date of border crossing or \ncompletion  of  works),  the  authorized  bank  [must]  inform  the  local  tax  and \ncustoms authorities in writing to take measures according to the law. \n\u2026  upon  the  request  of  the  tax  authorities  the  banks  must  provide  the \ntransaction data of their customers required for monitoring the integrity and \ncompleteness of all due tax payments. \nAll these non-core functions destroyed the trust in banks and increased their costs. \nDirect intervention in pricing loans and the presence of state direct loans also damaged \nbanks\u2019 risk management practices. \nIn addition, the CBU maintained a heavily overvalued UZS exchange rate by restricting \nthe availability of foreign currency to finance imports; it also required exporters of \ncotton  and  gold  to  sell  100%  of  their  foreign  currency  earnings  at  this  distorted \nexchange rate. It required other exporters to sell 50% of their foreign currency earnings \nat a distorted price (IMF 2000, 2008, 2013). Small businesses and private individuals \nthus  have  had  restricted  access  to  international  payment  instruments  and  foreign \ncurrency, which then created an unofficial black market for foreign currency. Figure 4 \nshows that, until the second quarter of 2017, the gap between the official and the black \nmarket exchange rate widened. From September 2017, the Government of Uzbekistan \nliberalized the access to foreign exchange and devalued Uzbek soms twice, which \nnarrowed this gap.  \n   \n                                                 \n10  Law  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  on  \u201cBanks  and  Banking\u201d.

Article 28 states that all financial service \nproviders need to insure their liabilities for the case of bankruptcy or liquidation.

On  its  website,  the \nSparkassen-Finanzgruppe reported13:  \nBased on an analysis of general financial literacy in Uzbekistan, a gender-\nspecific national strategy was developed to raise the level of basic financial \neducation of the Uzbek population. This 5-year strategy details the objectives, \nstructures, methods and target groups of financial education in Uzbekistan. \nFurthermore,  a  two-year  action  plan  was  devised,  listing  specific  activities, \nresponsibilities,  a  timeframe  and  budget  for  the  strategy\u2019s  implementation. \nSparkassenstiftung completed all of this work by the close of 2016.

Courses  for  local  trainers  featuring  simulations  for  financial  budget \nplanning and the promotion of small-scale enterprises have proven particularly \nsuccessful in this context.

The  program  consists  of two  parts:  the  first targets  owners  of  small  and \nmedium-sized businesses, and the second aims to educate the general population. It  \nis  not  clear  whether  the  financial  literacy  program  will  be  included  in  the  school \ncurriculum.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATION  \nThis chapter demonstrates that household and firm financial inclusion in Uzbekistan \nremains low. First, the majority of households, rather than using formal finance, save \nand borrow informally. Low-income households have less access to finance than their \npeers in high-income groups. Although most households are increasingly using a bank \naccount, few borrow/save with a formal financial institution. Pension coverage is high \nbut mainly limited to public sector employment; people employed informally have no \npension coverage. The use of insurance services is even lower. Internet and mobile \npayments have spiked in recent years; however, the usage level remains low relative to \nthat in other countries, like the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and the Russian \nFederation. Almost all firms use a bank account, but few borrow from a financial \ninstitution. Few  firms  use  e-payments.  The low  banking  sector  penetration  rate  in \n                                                 \n14  Information on this is available on the Central Bank of Uzbekistan\u2019s website.

Ahunov \n \nUzbekistan relative to countries with a similar level of development also suggests that \nfinancial inclusion is low. Uzbekistan thus needs to increase the level of financial \ninclusion for firms and households to achieve equitable and rapid growth of income per \ncapita, which is one of the key goals of all economic reforms.  \nSurvey-based evidence suggests that both households and firms indicated the high \ncost of using finance as the top reason for not using it. As the second most important \nreason for not using formal finance, households declared that religious reasons stop \nthem  from  using  formal  finance.  Indeed,  given  that  88%  of  the  members  of  the \npopulation of Uzbekistan are Muslims, the fact that no banks offer an Islamic banking \nproduct indicates a clear gap in the supply. Unlike households, firms reported that the \ncomplex application procedures and high collateral requirements are the second and \nthird most important reasons for not using formal finance. These reasons thus suggest \nthat financial inclusion in Uzbekistan is mainly constrained by supply-side factors. \nOn the supply side, the financial system is highly concentrated, with five commercial \nbanks controlling more than half of the banking sector assets. This is in line with Beck, \nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2004), who, based on a comparison of international \nevidence, concluded that, in countries with higher banking concentration, firms face \ngreater obstacles in accessing finance. All these large banks are state owned and \nmainly focus on financing government-led projects and programs. The lending rate for \nthese  state  projects  is  often  below  the  market  rate,  which  undermines  the  risk \nmanagement practices of banks and limits the availability of finance to the private \nsector. The limited supply of finance to the private sector and limited competition in the \nsector  make  finance  expensive  for  private-sector  players  and  constrain  financial \ninnovation. This is in line with Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2004), who \nreported that state ownership of banks and direct intervention in banking activities \nworsen access to finance.  \nStrikingly, although the level of financial inclusion is low, the country has no financial \ninclusion strategy, and, even more surprisingly, we detected no ongoing discussions \nabout such a document. The first policy recommendation, therefore, is that the country \nneeds to formulate a national financial inclusion strategy to enable a strategic approach \nto the matter. Second, based on international experience, it should promote private  \nand foreign capital participation in banking, insurance, and other segments of the \nfinancial markets. Third, financial liberalization, which has accelerated since 2017, \nthough removing most of the restrictions in access to foreign exchange, needs to \ncontinue; market-based interest rates and commission fees on financial services are \nessential for the efficiency and inclusiveness of the system.  \nThe  liberalization  of  the  banking  system  will  also  require  the  Central  Bank  of \nUzbekistan to move towards the use of market-based instruments to regulate and \nsupervise financial institutions: the current heavy reliance on the use on non-market-\nbased instruments needs to cease. The regulator, to foster competition among financial \ninstitutions, may also want to license fintech and telecom companies and promote  \nthe legal framework to enable peer-to-peer lending. At the practical level, promoting \nnon-conventional financial institutions and products might not be an easy task. For \nsuch cases, countries like Singapore and others have devised clear procedures that \nfinancial institutions can apply for a regulatory sandbox.15 As the Consultative Group to \nAssist the Poor (CGAP) explained, a regulatory sandbox is \u201ca framework set up by a \n                                                 \n15  Information on the procedures to apply a Fintech regulatory sandbox in Singapore is available from the \nwebsite of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

To  encourage  these  in \nadditional to financial liberalization and the use of market-based tools of regulation and \nsupervision, the Government needs to facilitate infrastructure development, like the \ncreation of remote identification facilities.  \nThe  country  needs  to  improve  its  financial  consumer  protection.  The  current \ninstitutional structure, which pools financial and general consumer protection together, \nmay  not  provide  adequate  safeguards.  Rutledge  (2010),  based  on  six  transition \neconomies, explained that the financial crises of 2008 and 2009 demonstrated that the \nsustainability of financial systems is highly dependent on the existence of adequate \nconsumer protection. Rutledge also explained that such protection should put systems \nin place that ensure that consumers make fully informed decisions when deciding to \nbuy financial services and while using them along with easy and provide less costly \nmechanisms for settling conflicts with financial institutions. Finally, consumers need to \nhave access to resources that enable them to gain financial education in any form and \nat the most convenient time. To achieve this, the Government needs to adjust the Law \non \u201cConsumer Protection\u201d to fit the specific needs of financial services. Moreover, \ninstitution wise, the country needs specific institutions that focus on financial consumer \nprotection.  \nThe evidence on the level of financial literacy in Uzbekistan remains limited. The \navailable sources imply that the level of financial literacy is low. The existing studies, \nlike  that  by  Klapper,  Lusardi,  and  Panos  (2013),  have  suggested,  based  on  the \nRussian Federation, that financially literate people are more likely to use formal finance \nrather than informal finance compared with financially illiterate people; the ability of \nindividuals  to  avoid  negative  income  shocks  and  have  higher  spending  capacity \nincreases with their level of financial literacy. Thus, to promote financial inclusion, the \ncountry needs to promote financial literacy. \n   \n                                                 \n16  Website of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor.
