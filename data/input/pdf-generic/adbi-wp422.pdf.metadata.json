Growth  in  economic  activity  would  increase  the \nsize,  scale,  and  scope  of  payment  transactions.  Enabling  the  scale  and  scope  of  payments \nwould in turn increase economic activity. This would also require national payment systems to \nbe  regionalized  and  operate  with  cross-border  and  multi-currency  capabilities.  As  existing \nregional  payment  arrangements  have  illustrated  how  they  can  be  successfully  established, \nASEAN  can  itself  leverage  on  its  current  cooperative  forums  in  creating  a  more  regionalized \npayment  system.  In  doing  so,  it  faces  the  following  challenges.  First,  promoting  the  use  of \ncashless  payments  would  require \nimproving \naccessibility  to  basic  payment  infrastructure,  increasing  their  interoperability,  and  creating  a \ncompetitive  cross-border  retail  payment  scheme.  Second,  creating  cross-border  and  multi-\ncurrency  payment  systems  could  possibly  proceed  with  the  interlinking  of  existing  real-time \ngross  settlement  systems  within  the  region,  and  later  enlarged,  but  this  would  need  to  be \nsupportive  of  the  broader  goals  of  sequencing  financial  services  liberalization.  Third,  legal \nharmonization would need to keep pace with rapid technological and regulatory changes where \nthe introduction of settlement finality legislation is seen as an important precondition to support \ncross-border  payments.  Fourth,  managing  foreign  exchange  settlement  risk  would  need  to  be \naddressed  with  the  growth  in  global  foreign  exchange  market  activities  and  this  would  involve \nthe  development  of  risk-reduction  features  in  payment  systems.  And  fifth,  enhancing \ncooperation  would  involve  the  creation  of  regional  oversight  frameworks  and  cross-border \ncollateral arrangements as systems become increasingly interconnected and interdependent in \nthe long run. \n \nJEL Classification: E42, E58, G28 \n\ninvolvement \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nADBI Working Paper 422 \n \n \n \nContents \n\nIntroduction\n\n \n ..................................................................................................................... 3\n\nPolicy Issues in Promoting Efficiency\n\n \n .............................................................................. 5\n\nCash\nCashless Payments\nRegionalization\nFinancial Services Liberalization\nCross-Border and Multi-Currency Systems\nRegional Cooperation\n\n \n ................................................................................................................... 5\n \n ............................................................................................ 7\n \n ................................................................................................... 8\n \n ........................................................................10\n \n ........................................................11\n \n ........................................................................................12\n\n3. \n\nRegulatory Issues in Safeguarding Stability\n\n \n ...................................................................13\n\nFinancial Market Infrastructures\nLegal Framework\nForeign Exchange Settlement Risk\nCooperative Oversight\nCross-Border Collateral Arrangements\n\n \n .........................................................................13\n \n ...............................................................................................14\n \n ....................................................................15\n \n .......................................................................................15\n \n ..............................................................16\n\n4. \n\nConclusion\n\n \n .....................................................................................................................16\n\nReferences\n\n \n ...............................................................................................................................18\n\n2.1 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n2.4 \n2.5 \n2.6 \n\n3.1 \n3.2 \n3.3 \n3.4 \n3.5 \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nThis paper examines the policy and regulatory issues involved in creating an Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) payment system to support regional financial integration \nunder  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community  (AEC)  2015  blueprint.  Payment  systems  play  a \ncore intermediating function in any modern economy providing the basis for moving money \nswiftly,  safely,  and  seamlessly.  They  consist  of  a  set  of  instruments,  banking  procedures \nand,  typically,  interbank  funds  transfer  systems  that  ensure  the  circulation  of  money.  They \noperate  as  the  \u201cplumbing  system\u201d  for  financial  markets  and  help  improve  macroeconomic \nmanagement, releasing funds from the clearing and settlement functions for more productive \nuse, reducing float levels, and improving the control of monetary aggregates. The principles \nof  payment  systems  involve  the  discharge  of  financial  obligations  between  two  or  more \npayment  participants,  providing  financial  markets  promptness  and  certainty  in  the  payment \nand  settlement  of  borrowed  and  invested  funds.  In  addition,  it  provides  consumers  the \nconvenience  of  time  and  location,  the  choice  of  payment  options,  and  the  privacy  and  low \ncost of making payments. \n\nASEAN member countries vary in their level of economic development and hence progress \nand  readiness  in  sequencing  reforms  of  their  capital  accounts,  capital  markets,  financial \nservices  sectors,  and  payment  and  settlement  systems  to  support  regional  financial \nintegration (ASEAN Secretariat 2008). As the AEC blueprint envisions the free flow of goods, \nservices,  investment,  skilled  labor,  and  the  freer  flow  of  capital  within  the  region,  the \nexpected  increase  in  economic  activity  would  require  the  creation  of  an  efficient  and  safe \nASEAN  payment  system.  Although  traditional  correspondent  banking  networks  provide  an \nimmediate  channel  for  cross-border  funds  transfers  in  the  region,  it  can  be  argued  that  a \nmore  modern  and  regionalized  payment  system  can,  and  should,  be  developed  as  the \nregion deepens financial integration in the long run. Such systems would need to support the \ngrowth  of  trade  settlement,  cross-border  retail  payments,  international  remittances,  cross-\nborder securities settlement systems (SSS), and foreign exchange settlement. \n\nTable 1 illustrates industry growth projections for the future global payments market, where \nthe  Asia-Pacific region  is  expected  to gain  the  largest  share  of transaction  volumes (28%), \ntransaction  values  (38%),  and  revenues  (34%)  by  2020  (Boston  Consulting  Group  2011). \nTransaction volumes and values are estimated to reach US$212 billion and US$301 trillion, \nrespectively. Total payment-related revenues generated will reach US$533 billion. \n\nAlthough  the  major  source  of  this  growth  will  be  driven  by  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC) and India in particular, it can be argued that the ASEAN region as a whole would also \nbenefit  from  this  growth  in  the  Asia-Pacific  payments  market,  particularly  as  a  result  of  an \nincrease  in  intra-regional  trade  and  from  free  trade  agreements  (FTA),  where  the  ASEAN-\nPRC  FTA,  the  ASEAN-Republic  of  Korea  (henceforth,  Korea)  FTA,  and  ASEAN-Australia-\nNew Zealand FTA have been signed, and the ASEAN-India FTA and ASEAN-Japan FTA are \nunder  negotiation  as  of  2011.  This  growth  trend  in  Asia  coincides  with  the  outlook  for \nremittance flows to developing countries for the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) (US$117 billion \nin  2013)  and  South  Asia  (US$100  billion  in  2013)  regions  which  form  a  larger  share \ncompared  with  other  developing  regions  of  the  world  which  is  forecast  to  reach  US$404 \nbillion in 2013 (World Bank 2011a). \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Khiaonarong \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Projected Share of the Asia-Pacific Region in the Worldwide Payments Market, 2010 and 2020 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2010 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNorth America \n\nLatin \nAmerica \n\nWestern \nEurope \n\nCentral and \nEastern Europe \n\nAsia-Pacific \n\nMiddle East and \nNorth Africa \n\nRest of \nWorld \n\nTotal \n\nVolume (millions) \n\n116,700 \n\n29,000 \n\n78,000 \n\n11,900 \n\n65,400 \n\n4,000 \n\n1,200 \n\n306,300 \n\nValue (US$ millions) \n\n95,595,100 \n\n20,841,600 \n\n98,739,100 \n\n18,647,000 \n\n90,913,100 \n\n5,314,600 \n\n1,323,200 \n\n331,373,700 \n\nTotal revenues (US \n$millions) \n\n159,900 \n\n71,200 \n\n146,600 \n\n40,300 \n\n40,300 \n\n29,200 \n\n2,400 \n\n589,900 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2020 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nNorth America \n\nLatin \nAmerica \n\nWestern \nEurope \n\nCentral and \nEastern Europe \n\nAsia-Pacific \n\nMiddle East and \nNorth Africa \n\nRest of \nWorld \n\nTotal \n\nVolume (millions) \n\n206,700 \n\n109,000 \n\n125,200 \n\n30,400 \n\n212,500 \n\n37,500 \n\n28,500 \n\n749,800 \n\nValue (US$ millions) \n\n137,480,600 \n\n71,254,100 \n\n154,780,000 \n\n52,909,400 \n\n301,147,200 \n\n34,751,600 \n\n29,682,800 \n\n782,005,700 \n\nTotal revenues (US$ \nmillions) \n\nSource: Boston Consulting Group (2011). \n\n284,500 \n\n195,200 \n\n276,200 \n\n97,400 \n\n533,800 \n\n132,300 \n\n60,000 \n\n1,579,400 \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nFigure  1  illustrates  the ASEAN  payment  traffic sent  by  country  in  2010 as  compiled  by  the \nSociety  for  Worldwide  Interbank  Financial  Telecommunication  (SWIFT).  Payment  traffic \nincludes transactions related to payments, treasury, securities, and trade finance, and helps \nmeasure  the  level  of  activity  and  growth  in  each  country.  While  Singapore,  Malaysia, \nThailand, and Indonesia have a larger concentration of payment traffic, there was a positive \ngrowth  trend  for  all  countries  for  2009\u20132010.  A  sharp  increase  of  payment  traffic  can  be \nobserved for Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) due to an increase in the number \nof banks that joined SWIFT and heightened economic and financial activities. \n\nFigure 1: ASEAN Payment Traffic Sent for 2010 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: SWIFT. \n\n2.1  Cash \n\nThe  remaining  parts  of  the  paper  are  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  examines  the  policy \nissues  in  creating  an  efficient  payment  system  for  the  ASEAN  region.  Section  3  examines \nthe regulatory issues relating to safeguarding stability. Section 4 concludes the paper. \n\n2.  POLICY ISSUES IN PROMOTING EFFICIENCY \n\nAchieving  the  vision  statement  \u201cASEAN  Payments  aim  to  foster  integrated,  safe,  and \nefficient  payment  and  settlement  systems  in  the  region  that  enable  businesses  and \nindividuals to make or receive electronic payments with greater convenience\u201d would require \nthe  development  of  a  seamless  payment  system  within  the  region,  but  one  of  the  most \nchallenging  tasks  will  be  promoting  the  use  of  more  non-cash  payment  methods,  which \ncontinues to serve a popular means of payment (WC-PSS 2011). \n\nWhile a country\u2019s payment costs can be substantial at 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), \ncost-savings of 1% of GDP can also be realized if there is a shift from a fully paper-based to \na  fully  electronic-based  payment  system  (Humphrey,  Lindblom,  and  Bergendahl  2003).  In \nEurope,  for  example,  the  gradual  move  towards  the  use  of  electronic  payments  and \nsubstitution of ATMs for traditional banking offices has helped reduce bank operating cost by \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nsome  US$32  billion,  saving  0.38%  of  12  nations\u2019  GDP  over  the  period  1987\u20131999 \n(Humphrey, Bergendahl, and Lindblom 2005). \n\nPayment cost studies conducted in the Netherlands estimate the overall social cost of point-\nof-sales payments at EUR2.9 billion per year, or 0.65% of GDP, while the share of the cost \nof cash is 73% of the total social cost or at 0.48% of GDP (Van Hove 2008). Comparatively, \nin Belgium, the social cost estimate was at 0.74% of GDP, while the share of cost of cash is \n75% of the total social cost, or at 0.58% of GDP. In Finland, estimates of the social cost of \npayments is at 0.3% of GDP, where the share of the cost of cash at 0.1% of GDP (Takala \nand Viren 2008). These studies further argue that the marginal social cost of  cash is much \nhigher  than  the  use  of  non-cash  payment  methods,  particularly  debit  cards  and  electronic \npurses,  so  with  proper  incentives,  such  cost-savings  would  lead  to  the  adoption  of  more \nefficient payment methods. \n\nThis  empirical  evidence is  relevant for  ASEAN  countries  as they  move towards  introducing \nmore efficient payment systems at the national and regional levels with the wider expansion \nof  the  Asian  payments  market.  But  ASEAN  countries  also  vary  in  their  payment  patterns \nwhere  electronic  payments  are  widely  used  in  some  and  emerging  in  others.  Figure  2 \nmeasures  the  stock  of  cash  in  ASEAN  countries  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  for  the  period \n1988\u20132009. In most countries the stock of cash ranges from 4% to 10% of GDP (for Brunei \nDarussalam,  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Philippines,  Singapore,  and \nThailand). The ratios for Myanmar and Viet Nam are comparatively higher at above 10% of \nGDP. In terms of stock, there was a clear downward trend for cash in two of the 10 ASEAN \ncountries (for Malaysia and Singapore). Comparatively, a clear rising trend can be observed \nfor Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam and a more stable pattern can be seen for \nIndonesia and the Philippines. It is also helps to note that some ASEAN countries, such as \nCambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Myanmar,  are  highly  dollarized,  i.e.,  there  is  widespread  use  of \nhard currency in daily economic activity. \n\nFigure 2: Cash in Circulation as a Percentage of GDP \n\nBrunei = Brunei Darussalam.    \n\nSource: IMF (2011), ADB (2010b). \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nThe  rate  of  cash  substitution  with  non-cash  payment  alternatives  is  one  of  several  factors \nthat  has  helped  reduce  the  stock  of  cash.  Some  of  these  alternatives  include  the  use  of \nchecks,  direct  credits,  direct  debits,  debit  cards,  credit  cards,  and  electronic  money  for \nfinancial  transactions.  But  the  use  of  such  alternatives  relies  on  the  retail  payments \ninfrastructure such as the availability of automated teller machines (ATM) and point of sale \n(POS)  terminals  and  the  circulation,  and  use,  of  payment  cards  to  substitute  for  cash \npayments. As the stock of cash also reflects cash as a \u201cstore of value\u201d, financial authorities \ncan  also  play  an  influential  role  in  establishing  whether  they  want  the  stores  of  value \nrepresented  by  cash  to  migrate  to  banks,  post  offices,  telephone,  companies  or  to  some \nother \u201cnon-cash\u201d storage point. And as retail and business customers do not use the central \nbank for accounts, this linkage requires close collaboration with the institutions that are used \nfor stores of value. \n\n2.2  Cashless Payments \n\nPromoting retail electronic payments as cash substitute and encouraging the establishment \nof  a  cross-border  retail  payments  scheme  are  among  some  of  the  key  challenges  in \nachieving  an  efficient  payment  system.  Recent  studies  in  the  European  context  argue  that \nelectronic retail payment instruments help stimulate economic growth and, moreover, show \nthat  initiatives  to  integrate  and  harmonize  retail  payment  markets  foster  trade  and \nconsumption  and  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  the  economy  (Hasan,  De  Renzis,  and \nSchmiedel 2012). \n\nComparatively,  cashless  retail  payment  in  the  EAP  region  remains  relatively  low  with  an \naverage of 13 transactions per person a year (World Bank 2011b). This compares with 100 \nor more for the European Union (EU), 20 for Europe and Central Asia (ECA), and about 19 \nfor the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) regions. Cashless transactions include payment \ntransactions  made  with  checks,  direct  credit  transfers,  direct  debits,  payments  with  debit \ncards  and  credit  cards,  and,  where  available,  payments  with  e-money  and  prepaid  and \nstored-value cards. \n\nThe variation can be explained by the following: the slow development of delivery channels \nfor  cashless  payments  (ATMs  and  POS),  lack  of  interoperability  across  systems,  limited \naccess for the rural population to modern payment instruments, limited competition, and the \nneeds  of  the  public  sector  and  large  commercial  firms  not  being  adequately  addressed  by \nauthorities  in  charge  of  reforming  the  national  payment  system.  Other  factors  such  as \nanonymity,  tax  evasion,  and  its  use  for  precautionary  and  speculative  purposes  are  also \ncommonly associated with the preference for using cash. \n\nATM and POS terminal availability is an important factor in promoting cashless payments as \nthey provide the basic payments infrastructure for gaining access to financial services to the \nwider population. While ATM penetration rates per one million inhabitants are relatively high \nfor  some  countries  (Singapore,  Thailand,  Malaysia),  they  remain  comparatively  limited  in \nothers (Cambodia). However, such figures remain lower than developed economies (Japan). \nSimilarly,  POS  terminal  penetration  rates  per  one  million  inhabitants  are  comparatively \nhigher  in  a  few  countries  (Singapore,  Malaysia)  than  other  ASEAN  countries.  Apart  from \navailability, ATM and POS terminal interoperability is also important where all payment and \ncash withdrawal cards can be used seamlessly in all ATMs and payment cards can be used \nseamlessly in any POS terminal in a given country, respectively. Such interoperability guides \nthe  achievement  of  Single  Euro  Payments  Area  (SEPA)  payments  in  Europe,  for  example \n(EACHA  2009).  Full  ATM  interoperability  only  exists  in  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and \nThailand (World Bank 2011c). It remains absent for POS terminals. \n\nPayment cards in circulation also influences the use of cashless payments per one thousand \ninhabitants  in  selected  countries.  Although  this  is  high  in  a  few  countries  (Singapore, \nMalaysia),  they  remain  comparatively  lower  in  others.  And  as  expected,  such  ratios  are \ncomparatively  lower  than  in  developed  Asian  economies  (Japan).  Payment  cards  are  a \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nnecessary means to access financial services through ATM and POS terminals, reducing the \nneed to visit a physical bank branch. \n\nThe  strategic  shift  towards  the  use  of  cashless  payments  would  require  a  coordinated \nresponse  by  both  the  public  and  private  sectors (CPSS  2003b).  For  example,  the financial \ncommunity  has  established  and  operated  a  variety  of  card  schemes  (VISA,  MasterCard, \nChina  Union  Pay,  American  Express,  JCB)  to  provide  capability.  Global  standard  players, \nsuch as SWIFT, have also connected financial institutions, market infrastructures, and even \ncorporations  across  borders  with  secure  and  standard  financial  messaging.  At  the  national \nlevel,  this  may  be  complemented  with  developing  the  necessary  payment  infrastructure  to \nincrease  the  availability  of  ATM  and  POS  terminals,  and  hence,  expand  financial  access. \nMobile  payments  have  also  emerged  as  a  feasible  financial  services  delivery  channel  that \ncould  achieve  high  penetration  rates,  particularly  in  economies  where  there  is  a  large \nproportion of the population that lack access to a basic bank account. \n\nAt  the  regional  level,  the  Asian  Payment  Network  (APN)  Forum  would  need  to  achieve \ngreater scale and scope economies by enlarging the network of ATM service providers and \nbroadening its range of services to support cross-border funds transfers and electronic POS, \nin  addition  to  its  current  cross-border  ATM  cash  withdrawal  service  offering.  As  this  would \ninvolve  the  conversion  of  foreign  currencies  for  settlement,  exchange  control  regulations \nwould also need to be considered by the concerned authorities. And to guide development, \nthis may evolve under the ASEAN Pay framework established by the region\u2019s central banks \nand  monetary  authorities.  As  cashless  payments  are  gradually  adopted  amongst  ASEAN \ncountries, this would also support the growth of cross-border cashless payments. \n\n2.3  Regionalization \n\nModern payment systems underpin financial integration and have become more regionalized \nas illustrated by the European Monetary Union with its creation of a common central bank, \nsingle  currency,  and  integration  of  financial  market  infrastructures  (FMI).  Prior  to  the \nintroduction  of  the  euro,  the  European  Currency  Unit  served  as  the  early  means  of \nsettlement amongst participating central banks in the European Monetary System (Scheller \n2006).  As  financial  integration  deepened,  the  need  to  link  and  harmonize  payment  and \nsecurities settlement systems, and related cross-border collateral arrangements, to support \nmonetary-policy  operations  and  strengthen  regional  financial  stability  gradually  evolved \n(ECB 2010a; ECB 2009a). \n\nFurthermore, the need to enhance efficiency in cross-border retail payments has led to the \ncreation  of  the  Single  European  Payment  Area  (SEPA)  where  all  euro  payments,  whether \nnational  or  cross-border,  are  treated  as  domestic  and  will  operate  under  the  guiding \nprinciples  of  one  currency,  one  set  of  instruments  (includes  credit  transfers,  direct  debits, \nand payment cards), one legal framework, and greater competition (ECB 2009b; ECB 2006). \nIn the long-term, European banks are expected to benefit from improved cost efficiency and \neconomies of scale and scope (Schmiedel 2007). \n\nThe  Asian  Clearing  Union  (ACU),  established  in  1974  and  comprising  eight  members \n(Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  Iran,  Myanmar,  Nepal,  Pakistan,  and  Sri  Lanka),  provides \nanother  example  of  regional  payment  arrangements  established  to  promote  trade  and \nfinancial  integration.  ACU\u2019s  objectives  are  to  facilitate  settlement  on  a  multilateral  basis, \npromote  the  use  of  participants\u2019  currencies,  improve  monetary  and  banking  co-operation, \nand expand trade and economic activity among the countries in the Asia Pacific region (ACU \n2009).  At  the  heart  of  the  multi-currency  settlement  system  is  the  use  of  Asian  Monetary \nUnits  as  a  unit  of  account,  comprising  of  the  ACU  dollar  and  ACU  euro.  This  allows \nparticipants  to  settle  transactions  in  US  dollar  or  euro  within  the  ACU  mechanism.  In \naddition,  a  currency  swap  arrangement  also  serves  as  a  facility  for  participants  in  settling \nimbalances in their clearing positions for a given settlement period. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nTable  2  illustrates  initiatives  to  regionalize  payment  systems  in  different  parts  of  the  world \nthat can be grouped into two categories\u2014interlink model and single shared platform model. \n\nTable 2: List of Initiatives to Regionalize Payment Systems \n\nRegional Initiative \n\nInterlink \nModel \n\nSSP \nModel \n\nStatus \n\nASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) \n\nDiscussion  \n\nCOMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) \n\nImplementation  \n\nBCEAO (Central Bank of West African States) \n\nBEAC (Bank of Central African States) \n\nECCB (Easter Caribbean Central Bank)  \n\nCIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) \n\nCMCA (Credit Mutuel de Centrafrique) \n\nEURO ZONE (European Union) \n\nGCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) \n\nSADC (Southern African Development Community)  \n\nWAMZ (West African Monetary Zone) \n\nSSP model = single shared platform model. \n\nNote: Status as of 18 May 2012. \n\nSource: SWIFT. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\n \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLive  \n\nLive  \n\nLive  \n\nLive  \n\nDiscussion  \n\nY \n\nLive  \n\nDiscussion  \n\nDiscussion  \n\nDiscussion  \n\nAn interlink model operates with a connectivity  mechanism across different  RTGS systems \nor  automated  clearing  houses  (ACH)  and  support  a  multiple  currency  environment.  Such \narrangements  operate  in  the  CMCA  region,  and  have  been  under  consideration  in  the \nCOMESA  and  WAMZ  regions.  The  single  shared  platform  model,  where  a  central \ninfrastructure  is  used  under  a  single  currency  environment,  has  been  operational  in  the \nBCEAO, BEAC, ECCB, CMCA and eurozone regions. In other parts of the world, including \nASEAN,  regionalization  of  payment  systems  have  also  been  under  discussion  in  various \npolicy forums. \n\nFigure 3 illustrates a stylized payment system for ASEAN. Under this arrangement, national \nRTGS systems operated by the central bank are inter-linked via an inter-linking mechanism \nto  enable  cross-border  and  multi-currency  capabilities.  Participants  such  as  financial \ninstitutions  and  ancillary  systems,  where  payments  or  securities  are  exchanged  and/or \ncleared, have access to the national RTGS systems where monetary obligations are settled \nreal-time  in  central  bank  money  to  help  minimize  any  potential  risks.  Achieving  such \nconnectivity  would  require  harmonizing  the  legal  framework,  message  standards,  and \noperational  hours  of  each  RTGS  system  among  others.  As  of  September  2012,  RTGS \nsystems  have  been  operational  in  seven  countries  (Indonesia,  Lao  PDR,  Malaysia, \nPhilippines,  Singapore,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam)  and  under  consideration  in  three  others \n(Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, and Myanmar) in ASEAN. \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nFigure 3: Stylized Model of a Regionalized RTGS System \n\n \n\nRTGS = Real time gross settlement systems. \n\nSource: Adapted from SWIFT. \n\n \n\nBilateral payment arrangements are another alternative where payment systems can play a \npart  in  facilitating  funds  transfers  and  trade  settlements.  Basic  services  include  the  use  of \nlocal currencies for trade settlement between exporter and importers intermediated through \ncommercial  banks  and  the  central  bank,  for  example.  Such  arrangements  help  trading \npartners  reduce  their  transaction  costs.  Malaysia\u2019s  use  of  bilateral  payment  arrangements \nwith  her  trading  partners  provide  such  an  illustration  and  are  often  established  in \ncircumstances  where  the  level  of  development  of  financial  and  payment  systems  of  a \nparticular  trading  partner  remains  rudimentary  (Vichyanond,  Sabhasri,  and  Vajragupta \n2002). \n\nAnother  recent  example  of  a  successful  bilateral  payment  arrangement  is  the  Brazil-\nArgentina  Local  Currency  Payment  System  (Sistema  de  Pagamentos  em  Moedas  Locais-\nSML).  This  is  a  voluntary  bilateral  agreement  between  both  countries\u2019  central  banks  under \nthe Mercosur framework that allows exporters and importers in both countries to set prices \nand  pay  for  goods  in  their  local  currencies,  respectively  (WTO  2009).  Key  features  of  the \nSML includes the SML rate that is published daily and determined by the cross-rate between \nthe Brazilian and Argentinean reference rates and the involvement of both countries\u2019 central \nbanks acting as clearing houses. As such, the arrangement seeks to promote trade amongst \nsmall-sized  entrepreneurs  between  both  countries,  reduce  their  transaction  costs,  and \npromote financial integration.  \n\n2.4  Financial Services Liberalization \n\nFinancial  services  liberalization,  with  the  gradual  removal  of  market  access  and  national \ntreatment  restrictions  in  the  banking,  securities,  and  insurance  markets,  will  also  lead  to \ngreater competition between domestic financial institutions against foreign financial services \nproviders.  This  would  also  impact  the  supply  of  alternative  payment  services,  particularly \nwhen  financial  services  are  provided  on  a  cross-border  basis.  Technological  progress, \nthrough  the  reduction  of  computing  and  telecommunication  costs,  would  help  expand \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nfinancial  access  as  illustrated  through  the  promotion  of  online,  mobile,  and  prepaid  card \npayments (McKinsey 2011). For example, mobile payments have improved financial access \nand enabled international remittance services in many emerging market economies (CGAP \nand World Bank 2010; CPSS 2007). \n\nIn  ASEAN,  many  countries  have  further  committed  to  the  Protocol  to  Implement  the  Fifth \nPackage  of  Commitments  on  Financial  Services  under  the  ASEAN  Framework  Agreement \non Services Schedule of Specific Commitments. This would see the gradual opening up  of \nclearing and settlement services for financial assets and payment and money transmission \nservices  in  countries  that  have  made  such  commitments,  which  would  help  modernize  the \nnational and regional financial market infrastructures. \n\nAlthough  ASEAN  may  emulate  the  success  of  well-established  regional  and  bilateral \npayment  arrangements  as  earlier  discussed,  it  also  faces  unique  challenges  such  as \ndifferences  in  the  level  of  development  across  member  economies,  co-existence  of  both \nrudimentary  and  state-of-the-art  payment  systems,  the  absence  of  a  common  monetary \npolicy and a single currency, and hence, the use of a common settlement currency, and the \nlack  of  a  common  central  bank  to  serve  as  the  main  governing  structure  and  settlement \ninstitution. Such challenges, although long-term in nature, are not insurmountable and would \nrequire the deepening of regional monetary cooperation. \n\n2.5  Cross-Border and Multi-Currency Systems \n\nAlthough traditional correspondent banking networks exist to provide cross-border payment \nservices,  cross-border  and  multi-currency  payment  systems  in  ASEAN  would  need  to  be \ngradually developed to support the growth in scale and scope of large-value payments and \nsecurities transactions that would originate from increasingly integrated capital and financial \nmarkets. While a majority of countries have modernized their payment systems by adopting \ndeferred net settlement systems such as ACHs and check clearing systems to more state-of-\nthe-art  RTGS  systems  that  handle  large-value  financial  market  transactions,  for  example, \nsuch systems would require further enhancement to include cross-border and multi-currency \ncapabilities (CPSS 1993). \n\nForeign  exchange  settlement  systems  with  payment  versus  payment  (PvP)  capabilities, for \nexample,  have  been  introduced  in  a  number  of  countries  to  help  reduce  potential  foreign \nexchange settlement risks. While the issue of safeguarding stability is a major concern and \ndiscussed  in  the  following  section,  the  issue  of  developing  foreign  exchange  settlement \nsystems that meets international standards would help increase foreign investor confidence \nand support the straight through processing of payments. \n\nCross-border securities settlement is another area the region would need to consider as part \nof its strategy to create an efficient and safe post-trading infrastructure as the cross-border \nbond  transaction  cost  in  the  ASEAN+3  region  (including  the  PRC,  Japan,  and  Korea)  are \ngenerally  higher  than  those  of  the(US)  or  the  European  Union  (EU)  (ADB  2010a).  As  an \nexpansion  in  investment  and  the  freer  flow  of  capital  can  be  expected  from  financial \nintegration,  the  need  to  introduce  delivery  versus  payment  and  cross-border  features  in \ndomestic SSSs, as well  as their regulatory oversight, would become increasingly important \n(CPSS 1995; CPSS 1992; CPSS-IOSCO 2001). \n\nAlternatively,  slow  progress  in  the  development  of  the  region\u2019s  bond  market  also  raises \nissues  about  the  immediate  need  for  building  and  improving  the  supporting  infrastructure, \nalthough  there  may  be  a  need  to  explore  the  development  of  a  regional  central \nclearinghouse  for  the  possible  growth  in  over-the-counter  derivatives  (Felman  et  al.  2011; \nGray et al. 2011). Some immediate key challenges include assessing the costs and benefits \nof  joining  ongoing  regional  initiatives  such  as  the  Asian  Bond  Market  Initiative  (ABMI), \nRegional  Settlement  Intermediary  (RSI)  proposal,  or  the  Pan-Asian  CSD  Alliance  where  a \ncommon platform and pilot project is being implemented (ADB 2010a; Euroclear 2010). \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nTrade  settlement  using  local  currencies  has  also  emerged  as  an  important  initiative  in \nASEAN.  As  an  increase  in  trade  in  goods  can  be  expected  under  the  AEC,  promoting  the \nuse  of  ASEAN  local  currencies  for  trade  settlement  can  help  reduce  transaction  costs \n(ASEAN  Secretariat  2010).  This  can  be  achieved  by  reducing  the  reliance  on  hard \ncurrencies,  and  the  need  for  converting  currencies  twice  during  settlement.  Some  key \nchallenges,  however,  would  be  promoting \nto  commercial  banks  and \nexporters/importers  that  mainly  use  hard  currencies  to  hedge  against  possible  foreign \nexchange risks (Vichyanond, Sabhasri, and Vajragupta 2002). \n\ntheir  use \n\n2.6  Regional Cooperation \n\nASEAN central banks and monetary authorities have long been involved in various regional \ncooperation forums  and initiatives  in  modernizing  payment  systems.  Regional  forums  have \nincluded  the  ASEAN Working  Committee  on  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems (WC-PSS), \nASEAN Pay, the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), and the \nSouth  East  Asian  Central  Banks  (SEACEN)  Research  and  Training  Centre.

The scope of work involves studying the \ncurrent  conditions  of  payment  and  settlement  systems  in  member  countries  and  to  draft  a \ncommon  vision  and  strategic  framework  to  help  guide  current  and  future  domestic \ndevelopment plans (WC-PSS 2011). \n\nASEAN Pay was conceptualized at the ASEAN Finance and Central Bank Deputies Meeting \nin  October  2002.  It  started  as  an  initiative  to  create  cross-border  payment  linkages  in  the \nASEAN region and to facilitate a more efficient, secure, risk-contained, and timely settlement \nof  international  payments  among  the  ASEAN  countries.  Five  ASEAN  countries  (Indonesia, \nMalaysia,  Philippines,  Singapore,  and  Thailand)  are  represented  in  this  forum  where  a \nsteering committee helps to oversee and supervise the overall project, and determines policy \nand  project  direction.  ASEAN  Pay\u2019s  most  notable  achievement  is  the  development  of  a \nstandards framework which has three main objectives: set forth a common set of standards \non  cross-border retail  payments,  clarify  rules  and  regulations  on cross-border transactions, \nand reinforce the steering committee\u2019s guidance to network service providers. \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nEMEAP is a cooperative organization of central banks and monetary authorities in the East \nAsia  and  Pacific  region  that  was  established  in  1991.  It  comprises  the  central  banks  of \neleven  economies  and  has  as  its main  objective  to  strengthen  the cooperative  relationship \namongst  them.  Five  ASEAN  central  banks  are  represented  in  this  forum  (Indonesia, \nMalaysia,  Philippines,  Singapore,  and  Thailand).  Its  Working  Group  on  Payment  and \nSettlement  Systems  serve  as  a  policy  discussion  forum  for  the  payment  systems  directors \nfrom  member  economies.  One  of  the  group\u2019s  achievements  has  been  the  compilation  and \npublication  of  Payment  Systems  in  EMEAP  Economies  and  Foreign  Exchange  Settlement \nRisk  in  the  East  Asia-Pacific  Region,  which  reflects  the  group\u2019s  collaborative  efforts  in \nresponse to initiatives led by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of \nthe  Bank for International  Settlements  (BIS) (EMEAP  2002;  EMEAP  2001). In  other  areas, \nthe  group  has  worked  to  examine  the  technical  aspects  of  national  RTGS  systems  that \noperate  within  the  region  and  the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  regional  payment-versus-\npayment system to help reduce foreign exchange settlement risk. \n\nSEACEN has served as the major platform for training and research for many Asian central \nbanks in addition to those of ASEAN. The centre, in collaboration with international partners \nsuch as the CPSS, has helped build capacity and networking opportunities for central bank \nofficials at both the intermediate and advanced levels on the important role of payment and \nsettlement  systems  in  emerging  economies.  All  ASEAN  countries  are  represented  in \nSEACEN. \n\nASEAN countries have also been involved in regional initiatives as follows: the APN Forum, \nthe  ASEAN  Common  Exchange  Gateway  (ACE),  the  ABMI  RSI,  and  the  Pan-Asian  CSD \nAlliance.  The  APN  Forum,  organized  since  2006  and represented  by  eight  network  service \nproviders in six member countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Korea, and \nThailand), was a follow-up development to the ASEAN Pay objective, as earlier discussed, \nwhich  aims  to  enhance  and  expand  services  for  cross-border  ATM  linkages  with  the \nestablishment  of  common  standards  and  business  operations  framework.  ACE  aims  to \nprovide a gateway for establishing electronic trading links among ASEAN stock exchanges \nto  support  the  development  of  regional  capital  markets  (ACMF  2009).  ABMI  RSI  envisions \nthe establishment of a post-trading settlement infrastructure for cross-border securities (ADB \n2010a). And similarly, the Pan-Asian CSD Alliance proposes the development of a common \nplatform for processing cross-border securities transactions in Asia (Euroclear 2010). \n\n3.  REGULATORY ISSUES IN SAFEGUARDING STABILITY \n\n3.1  Financial Market Infrastructures \n\nASEAN  countries  would  also  need  to  safeguard  the  stability  of  the  key  FMIs  that  operate \nwithin,  and  in  the  foreseeable  future  beyond,  their  jurisdictions.  This  has  received  much \nattention following the recent financial crisis in the US and Europe (CPSS 2010; CPSS 2001; \nCPSS  2000;  ECB  2010b).  The  principles  for  FMIs  cover  Systemically  Important  Payment \nSystems  (SIPS),  Central  Securities  Depositories  (CSDs),  Securities  Settlement  Systems \n(SSSs),  Central  Counterparties  (CCPs),  and  provides  guidance  for  over-the-counter  (OTC) \nderivatives  and  trade  repositories  (CPSS-IOSCO  2012).  It  also  addresses  the  key  risks \nrelating  to  systemic,  legal,  credit,  liquidity,  general  business,  custody,  and  investment,  and \noperational issues, and outlines the responsibilities of central banks, market regulators, and \nother relevant  authorities for  FMIs.  Furthermore,  recovery  plans  and  resolution  regimes for \nFMIs would also need to be put in place in the event of their disorderly failure that could lead \nto severe systemic disruption (CPSS-IOSCO 2012). \n\nUS and EU regulatory responses to the recent financial crisis help provide illustrations where \nauthorities  have  introduced  the  Dodd\u2013Frank  Wall  Street  Reform  and  Consumer  Protection \nAct and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), respectively, to help manage \nand reduce systemic risks. Recommendations for the clearing of credit derivatives by a CCP \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nto  prevent  any  potential  default  are  amongst  one  of  the  recent  developments.  Proposals \nhave  also  included  ring-fencing  basic  bank  utility  services  such  as  deposits,  loans,  and \npayment  services  from  the  riskier  and  speculative  activities  of  banks  to  protect  retail \ncustomers (ICB 2011). As global financial regulations evolve, ASEAN countries would need \nto assess their possible impact on their respective financial market infrastructures to prevent \nthe possibility of any regulatory arbitrage or competitive disadvantage. \n\n3.2  Legal Framework \n\nAs  cross-border  and  multi-currency  systems  cut  across  multiple  jurisdictions,  the  need  to \ndevelop  a  harmonized  legal  framework  to  provide  greater  legal  certainty  becomes  more \napparent (Legal Certainty Group 2008; CPSS 2006a). Challenges include ensuring that the \nlegal  concepts  of  finality,  netting,  collateral,  zero  hour  rules,  and  conflicts  of  law  are \naddressed  in  relevant  legislation.  This  would  include  making  amendments  to  related \ninsolvency  or  bankruptcy  laws  or  the  drafting  of  explicit  legislation  that  provides  legal \ncertainty for settlement finality to mainly prevent the possible unwinding of payments should \na participant default against its financial obligations in a payment system, which could further \ncreate  systemic  risk  and  compromise  financial  stability.  Apart  from  the  role  of  the  central \nbank and other related financial authorities, governments are uniquely positioned to provide \nenabling  legislation  to  support  finality  in  the  payments  chain  and  create  certainty  in \ninsolvency situations. Finality protection has also been a precondition for joining some multi-\ncurrency  payment  systems  such  as  the  Continuous  Linked  Settlement  (CLS)  system  to \nensure  full  observance  with  international  standards  and  to  prevent  any  possible  systemic \nrisks to participants in the system (CLS Bank International 2011). \n\nAccording to the IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) results and \nrecent surveys, the legal framework for many developing countries and countries in the EAP \nregion  in  particular,  suggests  considerable  improvement  is  needed  to  address  the  above \npayment  and  securities  settlement  concepts  (World  Bank  2011b;  IMF  and  World  Bank \n2002).  For  example,  there  is  a  lack  of  settlement  finality  rules  in  half  of  the  countries \nsurveyed,  suggesting  that  there  may  be  some  legal  uncertainty  remaining  in  certain \njurisdictions  in  the  event  of  insolvency.  Furthermore,  although  the  results  for  securities \nsettlement  where  the  issue  of  finality  of  securities  ownership  transfers  is  comparatively \nbetter,  this  is  lacking  behind  other  regions  of  the  world.  Singapore  and  Malaysia  help \nillustrate how the region\u2019s authorities have introduced explicit legislation that addresses such \nconcerns,  namely  the  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems  (Finality  and  Netting)  Act  of  2002 \nand the Payment Systems Act of 2003, respectively. \n\nThe EU and many other EU accession countries in the European and Central Asian regions \nillustrate  a  high  degree  of  harmonization  of  legal  frameworks  as  suggested  by  the  survey. \nThis  is  largely  attributed  to  the  adoption  of  the  Settlement  Finality  Directive  back  in  1998. \nOther relevant Directives include the Financial Collateral Directive that governs the provision \nof  financial  collateral  in  the  EU,  MiFID  that  governs  investment  services  and  the  pursuit  of \ninvestment  activities,  and  the  Directive  on  the  Reorganization  and  Winding  Up  of  Credit \nInstitutions. On 15 September 2010, the EU also published proposals for a European Market \nInfrastructure Regulation (EMIR) to help increase stability in the OTC derivative markets. \n\nOne  possible  approach  that  ASEAN  countries  can  adopt  in  harmonizing  their  legal \nframeworks with respect to settlement finality is to introduce a Model Law on Payment and \nSecurities  Settlement  Systems  as  a  guideline  for  member  countries  to  follow  before \ninterlinking their RTGS system. Such an approach has been adopted in Central America and \nthe Dominican Republic (Dubon and Heinrich 2011). \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\n3.3  Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk \n\nIn a recent survey of global foreign exchange market activity, the turnover and cross-border \ndimension of transactions were found to have increased over a three-year period (BIS 2010). \nAverage daily turnover increased to US$4.0 trillion in April 2010 from US$3.3 trillion in April \n2007, mainly due to a 48% growth in turnover of foreign exchange spot transactions. Cross-\nborder transactions were found to represent 65% of trading activity, while local transactions \naccounted  for  35%,  the  lowest  share  ever  since  the  survey  was  conducted.  The  average \ndaily turnover in the foreign exchange market that involved ASEAN currencies, measured by \ntheir  percentage  shares,  increased  for  the  Singapore  dollar,  the  Malaysian  ringgit,  the \nPhilippine peso, and the Indonesian rupiah during 2007\u20132010. \n\nA  major  issue  associated  with  the  growth  in  foreign  exchange  market  activity  is  the \npossibility  of  foreign  exchange  settlement  risk.  Since  the  failure  of  financial  institutions \narising  from  their  risky  and  speculative  trading  on  the  foreign  exchange  markets  have \nprompted  the  need  to  monitor,  manage  and  reduce  the  associated  foreign  exchange \nsettlement risk, central banks and monetary authorities have responded with the issuance of \ninternational  principles  and  best  practices  (CPSS  2008b;  CPSS  1998;  CPSS  1996;  CPSS \n1993). \n\nIn  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  authorities  have  responded  with  a  major  study  into  foreign \nexchange  settlement  risk  which  found  that  financial  institutions  in  some  countries  faced \nconsiderable  intraday,  or  even  inter-day,  exposures  due  to  the  wide  time  zone  differences \ninvolved  in  the  settlement  of  a  foreign  exchange  transaction  (EMEAP  2001).  This  has \nprompted many countries to create awareness of such risks to the banking industry and to \nintroduce  PvP  capabilities  in  their  RTGS  systems  to  help  reduce  foreign  exchange \nsettlement risks. \n\nAs the AEC may lead to an expansion in investment and freer flow of capital in the region, \nthe  need  to  manage  foreign  exchange  settlement  risk  arising  from  an  increase  in  foreign \nexchange  trading  activity  would  become  increasingly  important.  In  order  to  gauge  the \nsignificance of such risk, it helps to conduct surveys or supervisory reviews into the foreign \nexchange  trading  activity  of  financial  institutions  and  measure  its  size  against  bank  capital \n(BCBS 2012; CPSS-BCBS 2000). \n\nFurthermore,  it might  help  to  introduce  PvP  capabilities  into  existing  RTGS  systems  where \nthis is applicable. Such PvP capabilities seek to ensure the finality of settlement for foreign \nexchange transactions, thereby eliminating any settlement risk. The CLS system, as adopted \nby  Singapore,  provides  an  illustration  whereby  some  of  the  basic  entry  criteria  include \neligibility of currency, settlement bank membership, adoption of settlement finality rules, and \nprovision  of  liquidity  providers  (CLS  Bank  International  2011).  Other  existing  PvP \narrangements  include  the  cross-border  linkage  of  the  Malaysian  and  Indonesian  RTGS \nsystems  with  the  Hong  Kong,  China  US  dollar  (USD)  Clearing  House  Automated  Transfer \nSystem (CHATS) (HKMA 2012). \n\n3.4  Cooperative Oversight \n\nAs financial integration would create greater interdependencies in ASEAN payment systems, \nthere  would  be  a  need  for  financial  authorities  to  improve  in  the  area  of  cross-border \ncooperation. This may take the form of exchanging information in various regional forums to \na  more  formal  memorandum  of  understanding  whose  scope  can  range  from  information \nsharing, home-host supervisory cooperation, and cross-border crisis management.  \n\nCooperative oversight arrangements currently exist for systems such as CLS and SWIFT, for \nexample,  where  the  US  and  Belgian  central  banks  have  lead  oversight  authority, \nrespectively, and where other central banks may also be involved in oversight (CPSS 2005). \nIn the European context, existing memoranda of understanding have addressed cooperation \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nbetween  payment  systems  overseers  and  banking  supervisors,  cooperation  between  EU \nbanking  supervisors  and  central  banks  in  crisis  management  situations,  cooperation \nbetween  EU  banking  supervisors,  central  banks,  and  finance  ministries  in  financial  crisis \nsituations, and cooperation between EU financial supervisory authorities, central banks and \nfinance ministries on cross-border financial stability (ECB 2010a). \n\n3.5  Cross-Border Collateral Arrangements \n\nCreating cross-border  collateral  arrangements (CBCA),  in  addition  to  information  exchange \nand swap arrangements, also provides a possible area for cooperation in creating a reliable \nsystemic liquidity infrastructure to support the smooth operation of payment systems and to \nhelp  safeguard  financial  stability  (CPSS  2006b;  World  Bank  and  IMF  2005).  In  the  Asia-\nPacific  context,  CBCAs  have  been  discussed  as  a  way  of  maintaining  regional  financial \nstability  especially  after  the  recent  global  financial  crisis  and  the  role  of  using  central  bank \nmoney in payment systems (EMEAP 2010). Such arrangements may help broaden the types \nof eligible collateral that may be accepted to meet the routine or emergency needs for extra \nliquidity  by  financial  institutions,  thereby  alleviating  the  liquidity  pressures  they  may  face \nduring  their  daily  operations.  It  also  concerns  the  role  of  using  central  bank  money  in \npayment  systems  (CPSS  2003a).  As  CBCAs  are  established,  there  are  improvement \nopportunities to automate the arrangements through further RTGS interlinkages. \n\n4.  CONCLUSION \n\nAchieving an ASEAN payment system would help support the smooth and safe flow of funds \ntransfers  as  the  region  deepens  financial  integration.  While  current  cross-border  payment \narrangements in other regions of the world help illustrate how they can facilitate cross-border \nfunds transfers, promote bilateral trade and capital markets, and safeguard financial stability, \nASEAN faces its own unique challenges on two fronts. \n\nOn  the  efficiency  front,  the  region  faces  two  challenges.  First,  promoting  more  efficient \ncashless  payments  would  require  basic  payment  infrastructure  to  be  developed.  ATM  and \nPOS terminals availability, which serve as more efficient financial services delivery channels \nthan  bank  branches,  would  need  to  expand.  Moreover,  enabling  interoperability  and \ntechnical standards harmonization across systems would also help reduce investment cost, \ncreate  greater  scale  economies,  and  support  the  straight  through  processing  of  payments. \nAmong some of the important standards includes the ISO 20022, which supports the end-to-\nend  straight  through  processing  of  payments,  and  the  adoption  of  the  international  bank \naccount  number  (IBAN)  standard.  Apart  from  increasing  this  supply  of  financial  services, \ndemand management  would  also  involve  promoting the  use  of  cashless payments through \nan  innovative  and  competitive  cross-border  retail  payments  scheme,  for  example,  where \nalternative payment methods like credit transfers, card payments, and electronic money are \ndeveloped  by  ASEAN  financial  services  suppliers.  While  this  would  largely  be  market-led \nand evolve through private sector initiatives in response to likely business case scenarios, it \nmay also benefit from the broader guidance from the financial authorities where the issue of \nsequencing  financial  services  liberalization,  such  as  in  permitting  cross-border  financial \nservices,  may  be  involved.  Such  developments  may  be  addressed  in  national  financial \nsector development plans where appropriate. \n\nSecond, creating  cross-border  and  multi-currency  payment  systems  would  need to  support \nthe broader goals of sequencing financial services liberalization. As ASEAN develops its FMI \nin  line  with  international  best  practices  in  its  move  towards  financial  integration,  it  will  help \nstrengthen the competitiveness and resiliency of the region\u2019s financial system vis-\u00e0-vis other \nregions of the world. But in doing so, ASEAN countries would need to assess whether or not \nincreased  interdependencies  of systems  would  compromise financial  stability  or  undermine \nthe  competitiveness  of  domestic  financial  institutions.  Developing  foreign  exchange \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nsettlement  systems  and  establishing  a  regional  settlement  intermediary  for  cross-border \nsecurities  are  among  some  of  the  immediate  issues  faced  by  ASEAN  countries  as  they \nmove closer to financial integration. Another key issue relates to the initiative to promote the \nuse  of  ASEAN  local  currencies  for  trade  settlement  to  help  reduce  the  associated  high \ntransaction  costs.  Apart  from  convincing  exporters  and  importers  of  the  benefits  of  using \nlocal  currency,  this  may also  require  considerable  central  bank  involvement  and  support  in \nterms of setting reference rates or interlinking RTGS systems. \n\nOn  the  stability  front,  the  region  faces  three  challenges.  First,  legal  harmonization  would \nneed to keep pace with rapid technological and regulatory changes. This would require, for \nexample, the adoption of settlement finality rules in relevant legislation such as in insolvency \nlaws  or  in  an  explicit  payment  and  settlement  systems  law.  This  seeks  to  provide  legal \ncertainty to mainly prevent the possible unwinding of payments should a participant default \nagainst its financial obligations in a payment system, which could further create systemic risk \nand  compromise  financial  stability.  As  such,  adopting  and  harmonizing  settlement  finality \nrules would be a precondition for creating cross-border and multi-currency payment systems. \n\nSecond,  managing  foreign  exchange  settlement  risk  would  need  to  be  addressed  with  the \nlikely expansion of related currency trading. As a possible first step, this may involve creating \nawareness amongst financial institutions on how foreign exchange settlement risk arises and \nhow  they  may  be  measured  and  managed.  Furthermore,  adoption  of  PvP  capabilities  in \nRTGS systems may be considered, where applicable, to ensure settlement finality in foreign \nexchange transactions. \n\nAnd  third,  enhancing  cross-border  cooperation  would  involve  the  creation  of  cooperative \noversight frameworks and CBCAs. As payment systems become increasingly interconnected \nand interdependent, there would be a need for financial authorities to consider cooperative \noversight  issues  of  such  systems.  This  may  take  the  form  of  exchanging  information  in \nvarious regional forums to a more formal memorandum of understanding whose scope can \nrange from information sharing, home-host supervisory cooperation, and cross-border crisis \nmanagement.  While  CBCAs  serve  as  a  supporting  measure  for  maintaining  regional \nfinancial  stability,  their  use  in  routine  or  emergency  situations  would  also  need  to  be \nconsidered by financial authorities. \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 422 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Khiaonarong \n\nREFERENCES \n\nACMF (ASEAN Capital Market Forum). 2009.

Growth  in  economic  activity  would  increase  the \nsize,  scale,  and  scope  of  payment  transactions.  Enabling  the  scale  and  scope  of  payments \nwould in turn increase economic activity. This would also require national payment systems to \nbe  regionalized  and  operate  with  cross-border  and  multi-currency  capabilities.  As  existing \nregional  payment  arrangements  have  illustrated  how  they  can  be  successfully  established, \nASEAN  can  itself  leverage  on  its  current  cooperative  forums  in  creating  a  more  regionalized \npayment  system.  In  doing  so,  it  faces  the  following  challenges.  First,  promoting  the  use  of \ncashless  payments  would  require \nimproving \naccessibility  to  basic  payment  infrastructure,  increasing  their  interoperability,  and  creating  a \ncompetitive  cross-border  retail  payment  scheme.  Second,  creating  cross-border  and  multi-\ncurrency  payment  systems  could  possibly  proceed  with  the  interlinking  of  existing  real-time \ngross  settlement  systems  within  the  region,  and  later  enlarged,  but  this  would  need  to  be \nsupportive  of  the  broader  goals  of  sequencing  financial  services  liberalization.  Third,  legal \nharmonization would need to keep pace with rapid technological and regulatory changes where \nthe introduction of settlement finality legislation is seen as an important precondition to support \ncross-border  payments.  Fourth,  managing  foreign  exchange  settlement  risk  would  need  to  be \naddressed  with  the  growth  in  global  foreign  exchange  market  activities  and  this  would  involve \nthe  development  of  risk-reduction  features  in  payment  systems.  And  fifth,  enhancing \ncooperation  would  involve  the  creation  of  regional  oversight  frameworks  and  cross-border \ncollateral arrangements as systems become increasingly interconnected and interdependent in \nthe long run. \n \nJEL Classification: E42, E58, G28 \n", "involvement \n", "in \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n"]}
