In addition to the fact that most of the labor force in \ndeveloping countries cannot afford to be completely unemployed, the standard \nlabor force framework currently in use worldwide is biased toward counting labor \nforce as employed rather than as unemployed. This systematically undervalues the \nfull extent of the unemployment problem. This paper suggests a better way to \ndetermine the threshold to measure underemployment using the cluster method. \nThe  robustness  of  its  results  is  assessed  using  ANOVA  tests,  Chow  test,  and \nrecursive dynamic regressions. Overall, results indicate that the proposed cut-off \npoint of 40 working hours per week is the best one.\n\n\fI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA. \n\nBackground\n\nUnemployment  and  underemployment  are  the  most  pressing  problems  in  Asia  today.  Using \nvarious estimates, out of a 1.7 billion labor force, around 500 million are either unemployed or \nunderemployed (ADB 2005). This re\ufb02ects an underutilization rate of about 29% of the total labor \nforce. The underutilization problem shown by the statistic might, however, just be the tip of the \niceberg since higher underutilization could have been detected if a better measure of unemployment \nand underemployment were used. \n\nTo start with, the standard labor force framework (LFF) currently in use worldwide may not \nnecessarily be always appropriate for developing countries. The LFF de\ufb01nes working as conducting \neconomic activities for at least one hour during a reference period. This working concept encompasses \nall types of employment situations: formal, informal, casual, short-time, and all forms of irregular \njobs. Accordingly, during the reference period,1 the worker could be working in self-employment,2\nfamily business, business enterprise, or even temporarily not working for a number of acceptable \nreasons.3 On the other hand, the unemployed comprises those who are not working, are available \nfor work, and looking for a job. The employed and unemployed constitute the labor force.\n\nThe LFF seems very straightforward but its implementation across countries varies considerably. \nMoreover, its implementation in developing countries has resulted in unemployment \ufb01gures that \nmany believe to be too low to represent reality. The LFF is criticized for being essentially biased \ntoward counting a person as employed rather than as unemployed. As a result, it systematically \nundervalues  the  full  extent  of  the  unemployment  problem.  This  situation  is  indeed  unfortunate \ngiven that the LFF was introduced in the 1950s to rectify the very same problem encountered by \nthe  previous  approach  of  \u201cgainfully  working\u201d,  in  which  a  working-age  individual  is  classi\ufb01ed  as \ngainfully or not gainfully working depending on whether he/she has a profession, an occupation \nor trade, but with no speci\ufb01cations for time reference and proof of existence of working activity. \nBox 1 summarizes this issue in more detail.\n\n1 The reference period of a labor force survey is usually one week prior to a survey date.\n2 Employers, own-account workers, and unpaid family workers are considered as self-employed.\n3 Persons temporarily not at work because of illness or injury; holiday or vacation; strike or lock-out; educational or \ntraining leave; maternity or parental leave; reduction in economic activity; temporary disorganization or suspension \nof work due to such reasons as bad weather, mechanical or electrical breakdown, or shortage of raw materials or fuels; \nor other temporary absence with or without leave should be considered as in paid employment provided they have a \nformal job attachment.\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nBOX 1\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE LABOR FORCE FRAMEWORK\n\nMeasuring labor utilization is important for at least two reasons: \ufb01rst, labor is a productive input \nthat cannot be stored and should not be wasted; and second, ownership of productive inputs determines \nincome, and many people in developing countries have only labor as their income source. \n\nThere  have  been  different  approaches  used  for  measuring  labor  utilization.  The  gainful  worker \napproach (GWA) was \ufb01rst used in the United States until the depression in 1930s. A new approach was then \nneeded as unemployment and underemployment became pressing problems that could not adequately be \nmeasured by GWA. Accordingly, the labor force framework (LFF) was introduced. By 1950, both approaches \nwere made available by the United Nations to all countries, but by 1970, the United Nations through its \nWorld Census Program abandoned the former approach and pushed for the use of the latter.\n\nIn  GWA,  a  working-age  individual,  minimum  10  or  15  years  old,  is  classi\ufb01ed  as  gainfully  or  not \ngainfully working depending on whether he/she has a profession, an occupation, or trade. There is no \ntime  reference  speci\ufb01ed  in  this  approach,  nor  is  proof  required  for  existence  of  any  working  activity. \nAccordingly,  the  approach  may  systematically  underestimate  unemployment  by  counting  those  with  a \nprofession, an occupation, or trade but already retired/without work as gainfully working.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  LFF  is  based  on  economic  activity  criteria  rather  than  economic  status. \nIn this concept, a working-age individual is classi\ufb01ed as working if he/she has conducted an economic \nactivity for at least one hour during the reference period. For those who are not working and looking \nfor a job, they are classi\ufb01ed as unemployed. The employed and unemployed constitute the labor force. \nTherefore, the working-age population can be classi\ufb01ed as either labor force or nonlabor force. \n\nAnother  main  reason  for  the  understated  unemployment  problem  above  is  because  most  of \nthe labor force in developing countries simply cannot afford to be completely unemployed. They \nmust take on whatever job is available to sustain their living. This is very different from the notion \nof \u201c\u2018having a job\u201d\u2018 or \u201c\u2018working\u201d\u2018 in developed countries, in which the job in general really pays, \nproviding a guarantee for a decent standard of living. In addition, the absence of unemployment \nbene\ufb01ts and the general condition of households in developing countries\u2014with their low income \nand saving\u2014further strengthen the case that most people in developing countries simply cannot \nafford to be voluntarily unemployed. In this context, therefore, a comparison of unemployment rates \nbetween developed and developing countries could be problematic given their different natures of \nemployment and unemployment. This is true even if they use of the same concept and de\ufb01nition \nof employment and unemployment. Moreover, there is also a statistical reason that the rates are \ncalculated from different labor force surveys, which have different scope and coverage, concept and \nde\ufb01nition of variables, and survey\u2019s reference period. This will make their results less comparable.\nBox 2 further highlights some conceptual problems in the LFF.\n\n2 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION I\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBOX 2\nCONCEPTUAL PROBLEMS IN THE LABOR FORCE FRAMEWORK\n\nThe LFF provides a comprehensive and consistent system of classifying the working-age population. \nHowever, the types of labor utilization included in the approach are more suited to the modern sectors in \ndeveloped countries. Accordingly, the approach may not adequately capture labor utilization in developing \ncountries, where the economy is still characterized by large agricultural and informal sectors (Myrdal 1968, \nHauser 1974, NSO 2007).\n\nAn  additional  problem  lies  in  the  LFF  implementation.  Results  of  classifying  individuals  into \ndifferent categories of employment depend on the types and structure of the questions used in the survey, \ninstructions to enumerators, data collection procedures, data processing, and other factors. There is also \na lack of expertise and resources to undertake labor utilization measurement in developing countries. In \nsome cases, conducting labor force surveys on a regular basis is even dif\ufb01cult in some countries.\n\nMyrdal  (1968)  further  highlights  the  inapplicability  of  the  labor  force  approach  to  developing \ncountries. The framework does not distinguish between labor reserve and readily available labor surplus, \nand measures labor underutilization only in terms of readily available surplus as described by unemployment \nand underemployment. In some developing countries, the labor reserve is larger than the readily available \nsurplus,  therefore  the  extent  of  idleness  or  underutilization  is  greater  than  what  is  measured  by  the \nlabor force approach. Accordingly, the problem of labor underutilization is not only unemployment and \nunderemployment but also the presence of idle labor reserve. This implies that the full employment of \nlabor will require a set of policies that will change attitudes and institutions with regard to employment \nand work.\n\nB.\n\nWhy an Underemployment Indicator is Needed\n\nTo  overcome  the  problem  of  understated  open  unemployment  highlighted  above,  an \nunderemployment indicator is introduced. The main purpose is to derive more representative indicators \nof underutilization by complementing the open unemployment indicator with an underemployment \nindicator.  As  in  the  case  of  open  unemployment,  a  higher  underemployment  level  indicates  a \nmore serious employment problem, and vice versa. In this context, it is implicitly assumed that \nthe underemployed also needs a job, a \u201cbetter\u201d job. There is also a good reason to combine the \nopen  employment  and  underemployment  indicators  since  both  represent  underutilization  of  the \nlabor  force.  ADB  (2005),  for  instance,  shows  how  the  two  indicators  are  combined  to  show  the \nunderutilization  trend  in  the  Philippines.  Box  3  summarizes  some  alternative  approaches  of  the \nlabor force framework.\n\nThe  resolution  concerning  statistics  on  economically  active  population,  employment, \nunemployment,  and  underemployment  adopted  by  the  13th  International  Conference  of  Labor \nStatisticians in October 1982, stipulated that each country should develop a comprehensive system \nof statistics on economic activity to provide an adequate statistical base for various users. In doing \nso,  each  country  should  consider  the  speci\ufb01c  national  needs  and  circumstances  for  both  short-\nterm and long-term needs. The economically active population comprises all persons providing the \nsupply of labor for the production and processing of economic goods and services for the market, \nfor barter, or for own consumption. \n\nMore speci\ufb01cally, the resolution concerning the measurement of underemployment and inadequate \nemployment situations, adopted by the 16th International Conference of Labor Statisticians in October \n1998,  concluded  that  statistics  on  underemployment  and  indicators  of  inadequate  employment \n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 3\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nsituations should be used to complement statistics on employment, open unemployment, and inactivity, \nincluding the circumstances of the economically active population in a country. The primary objective \nof measuring underemployment and inadequate employment situations is to improve the analysis of \nemployment problems and to contribute toward formulating and evaluating short-term and long-term \npolicies and measures designed to promote full, productive, and freely chosen employment. This \nwas speci\ufb01ed in the Employment Policy Convention (No. 122) and Recommendations (No. 122 and \nNo. 169) adopted by the International Labor Conference in 1964 and 1984. The main issue here is \nhow to de\ufb01ne and then measure underemployment. \n\nBOX 3\nALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO THE LABOR FORCE FRAMEWORK\n\nThere have been a number of alternative approaches attempted to remedy the de\ufb01ciencies of the \nlabor force approach. Myrdal (1968) outlined an alternative approach to labor utilization measurement \nin developing countries by measuring the difference between total labor input of the labor force with \ncomplete participation at an assumed standard of work duration, and labor input from actual participation \nexpressed as a ratio of the former. \n\nAnother alternative approach was developed by the Organization of Demographic Associates (ODA) \nin Southeast Asia. The ODA approach involves classifying the working-age population into four categories: \nworking for wages or pro\ufb01t, working outside the household without monetary payment, working inside \nthe household without monetary payment, and others. These categories are then further classi\ufb01ed into \nwork type subcategories. In addition, the categories and subcategories are subdivided into agriculture and \nnonagriculture. Therefore, three criteria are used to classify the working-age population, namely (i) working \nin  the  monetary  or  nonmonetary  sector,  (ii) inside  or  outside  the  household,  and  (iii) agriculture  or \nnonagriculture (Hauser 1974).\n\nOshima and Hidayat (1974) suggested a different approach for labor utilization measurement for an \neconomy characterized by labor shortage and/or labor surplus. In countries beset by labor shortage, an \nemployment status survey that discriminates those with and without jobs would give more information on \nthe employed. In the labor-surplus developing countries, an unemployment status type of survey would \nbe more appropriate to capture the different dimensions of labor underutilization.\n\nHauser (1974) proposed a measure of labor underutilization in developing countries by classifying \nthe workforce into those utilized adequately and those inadequately. The latter is classi\ufb01ed further by \nits  cause  of  underutilization,  namely,  unemployment,  inadequate  work  hours,  inadequate  income,  and \nmismatch of occupation and education/training. The adequately utilized workers are the residual of the \ntotal  work  force.  This  classi\ufb01cation  reveals  better  the  extent  of  underutilization  and  its  dimensions. \nThis is very important since each underutilization type may require different policy interventions. Labor \nunderutilization due to unemployment and inadequate working hours may require job creation. However, \nunderutilization due to inadequate income would call for policies in human resource development and \nproduction technology improvements. The mismatch case would require policy rationalizing, individual skill \nformation decisions both in the formal and informal education sectors, and human resources planning.\n\nC.\n\nMain Purpose of the Paper\n\nThis paper examines how the cut-off point used in determining underemployment can be very \ncritical in the resulting indicator and therefore in its policy implications. The cut-off point is critical \nbecause there are many workers working around the cut-off point such that a small change in the \ncut-off point will result in a much bigger change in the resulting indicator. Therefore, it is very \nimportant to derive the right cut-off point to reduce the risk of undermining the underemployment \nproblem. \n\n4 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION II\nDEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT\n\nTheoretically, the cut-off point should be determined in such a way that it can signi\ufb01cantly \ndifferentiate  two  groups  of  underemployed  and  fully  employed  with  regard  to  some  important \ncharacteristics  relevant  to  both  groups.  This  study  tries  to  make  a  contribution  in  this  area  by \ndemonstrating how the cut-off point can be determined in a more systematic way, i.e., by employing \na  clustering  method  to  determine  the  \u201ctheoretically  suggested\u201d  cut-off  point.  The  clustering  is \nbased on a monthly wage variable, which is selected as the most important determinant variable \nof working hours. The study uses the labor force survey data of Indonesia in 2003 (Sakernas 2003; \nsee BPS 2003).\n\nThe grouping result of underemployed and fully employed workers using the cluster method is \ncompared with the results of grouping using cut-off points of the International Labour Organisation \n(ILO) and the Central Board of Statistics (BPS). The comparison is conducted by employing a statistical \ntest of cross tabulations based on relevant variables. Furthermore, determinant function analysis and \neconometric method are used to further highlight why the results of using the cluster method is \nsuperior to both ILO and BPS approaches. A more comprehensive way of classifying underemployment \nusing the regression method on the determinant variables is also explored in this study.\n\nII. DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT\n\nA.\n\nDe\ufb01ning Underemployment\n\nUnderemployment is a situation wherein a worker is employed but not in the desired capacity, \ni.e., in terms of compensation, hours, skill level, and experience. Hence, employment is inadequate \nin  relation  to  a  specified  norm  or  alternative  employment.  There  are  two  principal  forms  of \nunderemployment: visible and invisible underemployment. Visible underemployment is a statistical \nconcept re\ufb02ecting insuf\ufb01ciency in the number of employed. The indicator of visible underemployment \ncan be developed using results of labor force surveys and other surveys. Invisible underemployment, \non the other hand, is primarily an analytical concept re\ufb02ecting a misallocation of labor resources, \nevidenced by a worker\u2019s low income and productivity and underutilization of skill.\n\nFrom a slightly different view, underemployment can take four forms: working less than full \ntime,  having  higher  skills  than  needed  by  the  job,  overstaf\ufb01ng,  and  having  raw  labor  with  few \ncomplimentary  inputs  (ADB  2005).  Along  this  line,  Hauser  (1974  and  1977)  developed  a  labor \nutilization  framework  to  better  measure  underemployment  that  includes  six  underemployment \ncomponents (see Box 4). \n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the standard theory of labor supply suggests that individuals \nwill  choose  their  optimal  number  of  hours,  and  that  employment  opportunities  are  likely  to  be \ndistributed  across  the  working  hours.  This  suggests  that  underemployment  is  not  a  persistent \nissue. Empirical evidence, however, suggests otherwise, as due to various reasons, there are some \nrigidities in the number of working hours that workers would like to work. Accordingly, time-related \nunderemployment has become an important issue. \n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 5\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nBOX 4\nLABOR UTILIZATION FRAMEWORK\n\nThe labor utilization framework (LUF) of Hauser (1974 and 1977) seeks to address the underemployment \n\nissue and has six components, namely: \n\n(i)\n\nSub-unemployed (S). This is the discouraged workers or job seekers category, and represents the \nmost serious type of underemployment. Included in this category are those who are not working \nand not looking for jobs for the main reason of \u201cunable to \ufb01nd a job\u201d or \u201cdiscouraged.\u201d (In the new \nILO de\ufb01nition of unemployment, these discouraged job seekers are included in the new de\ufb01nition \nof unemployed. See Sugiyarto et al. 2006 for a discussion on this as well as on its impact on the \nunemployment indicator in Indonesia.)\n\n(ii) Unemployed (U). This represents the unemployed calculated using the standard labor force approach, \n\nand covers  those who are not working and are looking for work.\n\n(iii) Low-hour workers (H). This includes workers who are involuntary working part-time or who work \n\n(iv)\n\nless than the normal working hours.\nLow-income workers (I). This includes workers whose work-related income is less than the minimum \nsocial requirement, i.e., less than 1.25 times the poverty line for an individual. \n\n(v) Mismatched workers (M). Mismatched workers can be a result of being overeducated compared to \nwhat is typically required in relevant occupations, i.e., years of schooling is more than one standard \ndeviation above the mean schooling years required for relevant occupations.\n\n(vi) Adequately employed (A).This is a residual measure indicating those not belonging to any of the \n\nabove \ufb01ve categories. \n\nAll the six LUF components are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, so that any individual in the \nlabor force can only be classi\ufb01ed into one and only one type of classi\ufb01cation. The \ufb01rst component of sub-\nemployment has sometimes been excluded from the labor force and therefore from the LUF. A comparison \nof LFF and LUF is summarized in Box Table 1.\n\nBOX TABLE 1\nA COMPARISON OF STANDARD LABOR FORCE AND LABOR UTILIZATION FRAMEWORKS\n\nSTANDARD LABOR FORCE\nFRAMEWORK\n\nLABOR UTILIZATION\nFRAMEWORK\n\nTotal labor force\n\nTotal workforce\n\nEmployed\n\nUtilized adequately\nUtilized inadequately by:\n\u2014Hours of work\n\u2014Income level\n\u2014Mismatch of occupation and education\n\nUnemployed\n\nUnemployment\n\nSource: Adapted from Hauser (1974).\n\n6 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION II\nDEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT\n\nB.\n\nMeasuring Underemployment\n\n1.\n\nConceptual Issues\n\nFor operational reasons, the statistical measurement of underemployment is commonly limited \nto visible underemployment. This can be measured by calculating the number of underemployed and \nthe quantum of underemployment. The underemployment indicator can be represented as a ratio of \nthe number of underemployed to the number of workers or the total labor force. The latter becomes \nthe underemployment rate. The quantum of underemployment, on the other hand, can be measured \nby aggregating the time available for additional employment of the underemployed workers.\n\nThe resolution concerning the measurement of underemployment and inadequate employment \nsituations,  adopted  by  the  16th  International  Conference  of  Labor  Statisticians  in  October \n1998,    further  recommended  that  measurements  of  underemployment  be  limited  to  time-related \nunderemployment, which is de\ufb01ned as all persons in employment who satisfy the following three \ncriteria of (i) working less than a threshold relating to working time, (ii) willing to work additional \nhours, and (iii) available to work additional hours.  In this context, the underemployed comprise \nall workers who are involuntarily working less than the normal duration of work determined for the \nactivity, and seeking or available for additional work. The normal duration of work for an activity \n(normal hours) should be determined in the light of national circumstances as re\ufb02ected in national \nlegislation to the extent it is applicable; in terms of usual practices in other cases; or in terms of \na uniform conventional norm. \n\nThe normal hours are the hours worked before  overtime payments are required. The normal \nhours can function as a ceiling on hours worked to deter excessive hours of work, or as a medium \nto obtain higher wages.\n\nMost labor laws mandate statutory limits on working hours. The initial working hour standard \nadopted by the ILO4 mandates a maximum of normal working hours of 48 hours per week. The more \nrecent approach at the international level5 is the promotion of 40 hours per week as a standard \nto be realized, progressively if necessary, by ILO member states (McCann 2005). The ILO research \nreveals that 40 hours per week is now the most prevalent weekly hour standard. Almost half of 103 \ncountries reviewed in the ILO report have adopted 40 hours per week or less (ILO 2005). \n\nThe working hour limit is initially intended to ensure a safe and healthy working environment \nand adequate rest times. The limit has also become a way of advancing additional goals of allowing \nworkers to balance their paid work with their family responsibility and other aspects of their lives, \npromoting productivity and reducing unemployment. \n\nFigure 1 shows the ILO strict framework for measuring underemployment, complete with the \nthree underemployment criteria. Examining the framework, there might be some conceptual problems \nin measuring underemployment. First, the question of \u201clooking to work for more hours\u201d might be \ninterpreted as only looking for more working hours from the existing jobs, excluding looking for \nadditional or even a completely new job. Second, there is no strict guideline on what availability \nmeans.  As  in  the  \ufb01rst  point,  availability  can  refer  to  available  for  more  working  hours  only,  or \n\n4 The hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919, No 1; and the hours of work (Commerce and Of\ufb01ces) convention, 1930, \n\n5 Re\ufb02ected in the Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935, No 47; and the reduction of hours of work recommendation, 1962, \n\nNo. 30.\n\nNo. 116.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 7\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\navailable for additional or new jobs. Third, the reference  period  for availability can refer to the \nsurvey\u2019s reference period or to the near future such as the next week or month. Most labor force \nsurveys  refer  availability  to  work  during  the  surveys\u2019  reference  period,  while  the  practice  in  the \nUnited Kingdom and other European countries (see, for example, Simic 2002) shows that availability \nin  fact  refers  to  period  after  the  survey.  The  different  reference  periods  will  of  course  produce \ndifferent results of underemployment.\n\nFIGURE 1\nTHE ILO LABOR FORCE FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT\n\nLabor force framework\n(economically active population\n aged 15 to 65 years)\n\nEmployed\n\nNot employed\n\nPart-time\n(less than threshold)\n\nFull-time (equal or \nmore than threshold)\n\nFull-time\n\nPart-time\n\nWorking hours\n\nWanting to work \nmore hours\n\nLooking to work\nfor more  hours\n\nNot looking to work\nfor more hours\n\nAvailability\n\nAvailable\nto work for \nadditional hours\n\nNot available\nto work for\nadditional hours\n\nAvailable\nto work for \nadditional hours\n\nNot available\nto work for\nadditional hours\n\nLooking\nfor job\n\nNot looking\nfor job\n\nFull-time\n\nPart-time\n\nUnderemployed\n\nSource: Adapted from Hussmanns et al.

Worse  still,  various  countries  interpret  the  guideline  differently  in \nimplementing the LFF, including on aspects that might be considered very obvious. \n\nFigures 2 and 3 show how the ILO guideline can strictly be implemented in Indonesia and the \nPhilippines.  Given  the  existing  labor  force  surveys  in  the  two  countries,  their  underemployment \nindicators will not be strictly comparable even at the conceptual levels. Moreover, both indicators \nare also inconsistent with the ILO framework. \n\nThe  Indonesian  and  Philippine  frameworks  have  their  own  issues  that  make  them  strictly \nincomparable.  Among  the  three  criteria  used  for  classifying  underemployed,  only  the  number  of \nworking hours is relatively comparable. The other two criteria of availability and willingness to work \nmore have been interpreted differently in the two countries, making their indicators inconsistent. \nThis case is not unique for Indonesia and the Philippines; it also creates dif\ufb01culty in deriving a \nconsistent underemployment indicator across other countries. A close examination of the existing \nlabor  force  surveys  in  the  developing  countries  reveals  that  a  strict  implementation  of  the  ILO \nde\ufb01nition on underemployment based on the LFF would be very dif\ufb01cult. In fact in some cases, \nstrict implementation is even impossible without imposing very strong assumptions about working \nhours, wanting to work more hours, and availability for additional jobs.\n\n8 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION II\nDEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT\n\nFIGURE 2\nINDONESIAN FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT\n\nLabor force framework\n(economically active population\n aged 15 to 65 years)\n\nWorking hours\n\nWanting to work \nmore\n\nAcceptance\n\nEmployed\n\nNot employed\n\nPart-time\n(less than threshold)\n\nFull-time (threshold\nand above)\n\nLooking for job\n\nNot looking for job\n\nLooking\nfor job\n\nNot looking\nfor job\n\nAccepting new job \noffered\n\nNot accepting\n\nFull-time\n\nPart-time\n\nUnderemployed\n\nSource: Adapted from the Indonesian Labor Force Survey (SAKERNAS 2003; see BPS 2003).\n\nFIGURE 3\nPHILIPPINE FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT\n\nLabor force framework\n(economically active population\n aged 15 to 65 years)\n\nEmployed\n\nNot employed\n\nPart-time\n(less than threshold)\n\nFull-time (equal or \nmore than threshold)\n\nWant\nto work\n\nDo not want\nto work\n\nWorking hours\n\nWanting to work \nmore hours\n\nLooking to job/\nadditional hours\n\nNot looking\n\nAvailability\n\nAvailable\nto work for \nadditional hours\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nAvailable\nto work for \nadditional hours\n\nLooking\nfor work\n\nNot looking\nfor work\n\nAvailable\nto start\n\nNot available\nto start\n\nUnderemployed\n\nUnderemployed\n\nExcluded from\nlabor force\n\nSource: Adapted from the Labor Force Survey Manual (NSO 2007).\n\nIn the Indonesian framework, for instance, the criteria of \u201cwanting\u201d and \u201cavailable\u201d to work \nmore  are  not  explicitly  accommodated  in  the  questionnaire.  Instead,  they  are  embedded  in  the \nquestion of \u201clooking for job.\u201d In this context, it is implicitly assumed that those looking for a job \nmust be wanting and available to work. This assumption is unfortunately not always true. \u201cLooking\u201d \nand \u201cavailable to work\u201d could in fact be completely independent, even if their reference periods \nare the same. People might be looking for a job now but not available to work straightaway. The \nmeasurement of open unemployment in the Philippines, which is also presented in Figure 3, provides \n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92  9\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\na good example on this issue as those who are not working and looking for jobs are not automatically \nclassi\ufb01ed as unemployed like in most other countries. Instead, they must also be \u201cavailable to work\u201d \nat the same time to be classi\ufb01ed as unemployed. If they turn out to be not available to work during \nthe reference period then they are not only excluded from the unemployed group but also excluded \nfrom the labor force. There are a signi\ufb01cant number of people in the Philippines who are excluded \nfrom the labor force because of this reason, i.e., they are not working and looking for a job but \nthey are also not available to work. They could be unemployed looking for a job but still waiting \nfor something else such as receiving a quali\ufb01cation certi\ufb01cate, graduation, and so on, hence they \ncannot start working immediately. A quick cross tabulation of the Philippine labor force survey in \n2005 results in about 0.3 million people in this category.\n\nTwo more problems can still be identi\ufb01ed from the Indonesian framework that can systematically \nunderstate its underemployment indicators. First, the question of \u201clooking for a job\u201d among workers \ncan be interpreted as looking for a new job only, excluding looking for more working hours from \nthe  existing  job.  Second,  as  there  is  no  question  on  availability  to  work  more,  the  question  on \nwillingness to accept a new job offer can be used as a proxy. Unfortunately, this question is only \nfor those who are not looking for a job. Therefore, it cannot be used.\n\nThe Philippine framework follows closely the ILO guidelines. In fact, it goes a step further \nby combining both looking for a job and more working hours into one question. Therefore, those \nlooking  for  a  new  job,  an  additional  job,  and  more  working  hours  are  included  already  in  the \nunderemployed. The question on availability to work is, however, referred to as the last two weeks \nprior to the survey date.\n\n2.\n\nPractical Problems\n\nIn  practice,  the  complete  recommendation  on  how  to  measure  underemployment  is  rarely \nused. The last two underemployment criteria of \u201clooking\u201d and \u201cavailable\u201d to work are hardly ever \nused.  As  a  result,  most  underemployment  indicators  are  calculated  based  only  on  working  less \nthan a threshold related to working time, i.e., working hours below the cut-off point for a fully \nemployed  worker.  Moreover,  the  practice  of  determining  the  cut-off  point  in  many  countries  is \nmostly inconsistent with the guideline that the cut-off point should be determined by considering \nnational circumstances, usual practices, or a uniform conventional norm. In reality, the cut-off point \nis determined in a less methodical way or even somewhat arbitrarily with no explanation on how \nand why the cut-off point is chosen.\n\nTherefore, most underemployment indicators are calculated based only on working less than \na  threshold  related  to  working  time,  i.e.,  below  the  cut-off  point  for  a  fully  employed  worker. \nAccordingly, the number of underemployed can be calculated by:\n\nUE\n\n(cid:29)\n\n)\nWK h\n\nc\n\n(cid:164)(\n\nh\n\n(cid:29)\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere UE is underemployed, WK is the number of workers, and h is the number of working hours, \nwhich are calculated from 1 to the cut-off point (c) hour. All workers with zero working hours are \nexcluded from the calculation.\n\nSince there is no universal de\ufb01nition on the minimum number of hours in a week that would \nconstitute full-time work, ILO has attempted to use a 30-hour per week cut-off point in as many \n\n10 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION III\nMETHODOLOGY AND DATA USED\n\ncountries as possible in its Part Time Worker indicator. Unfortunately, there is also no clear explanation \non why 30 hours per week was chosen (see the ILO Manual on Key Indicators of the Labor Market,\nin which underemployment is number 5 in the total 20 indicators).6\n\nThe actual cut-off points used across countries vary, ranging from 25 to 40 hours per week \nwith 5-hour intervals as the most common one. In Indonesia, for instance, BPS uses 35 hours per \nweek as the cut-off point for full-time workers but there is also no explanation why the 35-hour \nworkweek  was  chosen.  The  number  could  have  been  taken  from  the  previously  required  weekly \nworking hours for government employees. \n\nThis paper argues that the cut-off points used by both ILO and BPS of 30 and 35 hours per \nweek might be too low, especially for developing countries with the unique characteristics of their \nworkers and the nature of work they are involved in. Moreover, the cut-off point should theoretically \nbe determined in such a way that it can signi\ufb01cantly differentiate the two groups of underemployed \nand fully employed with regard to some important characteristics relevant to both groups. \n\nIII. METHODOLOGY AND DATA USED\n\nA.\n\nDetermining the Cut-off Point Using Cluster Analysis\n\nCluster analysis is employed to determine the cut-off point of working hours, which is then \nused as the base for grouping workers into fully employed and underemployed. In doing so, the \nclustering  method  groups  the  workers  into  two  signi\ufb01cantly  different  groups,  and  based  on  the \nactual average working hours of each group, the cut-off point that differentiates the two groups \nis  determined.  This  procedure  is  completely  different  from  the  common  practice  of  calculating \nunderemployment by using a cut-off point such as 30 hours (ILO) or 35 hours (BPS) per week, and \nthen calculating the number of underemployed workers based on the cut-off point used. \n\nThe cluster analysis encompasses a number of different algorithms and methods for grouping \nsimilar objects into respective categories. It is an exploratory data analysis to sort different objects \ninto groups in a way that the degree of association between two objects is maximal if they belong \nto the same group and minimal for otherwise. This technique has been applied to a wide variety of \nresearch problems. Hartigan (1975) provides an excellent summary of the many published studies \nreporting the results of cluster analyses. The method is useful to answer a general question on how \nto organize observed data into meaningful structures, i.e., to develop taxonomies. In general, cluster \nanalysis is very useful in classifying piles of information into manageable, meaningful groups.\n\nThe objects of groupings may be cases or variables. Cluster analysis is a good technique of \nexploratory data analysis when the data set is not homogeneous (or heterogeneous) with respect \nto the cases or variables concerned. A cluster analysis of cases resembles a discriminant analysis, \ni.e.,  classifying  a  set  of  objects  into  groups  or  categories  in  which  neither  the  number  nor  the \nmembers of the groups are known. On the other hand, a cluster analysis of variables is similar to \nfactor analysis because both procedures identify related groups of variables.7\n\n6 Altogether, the ILO Manual on Key Indicators of the Labor Market consists of seven major dimensions of a labor market, \nincluding indicators on labor force, employment, unemployment and underemployment, educational attainment, wages \nand compensation costs, labor productivity and labor costs, poverty and income distribution (ILO 2007).\n\n7  However, factor analysis has an underlying theoretical model, while cluster analysis is more ad hoc.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 11\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nThere are two methods for clustering objects into categories: the hierarchical cluster analysis \nand  the  K-means  cluster  analysis.  The  former  clusters  either  cases  or  variables,  while  the  latter \nclusters cases only. In hierarchical clustering, clustering begins by \ufb01nding the closest pair of objects \n(cases or variables) based on a measurement for distance, then combining them to form a cluster. \nThe algorithm continues one step at a time, joining pairs of objects, pairs of clusters, or an object \nwith a cluster, until all the data are in one cluster. The clustering steps in this approach can be \ndisplayed in a tree plot or dendrogram. This method is hierarchical because once two objects or \nclusters are joined, they remain together until the \ufb01nal step. Therefore, a cluster formed in a later \nstage contains clusters from an earlier stage, which contains clusters from a still earlier stage.\n\nK-means cluster analysis, on the other hand, starts clustering by using the values of the \ufb01rst \nk  cases  in  the  data  \ufb01le  as  temporary  estimates  of  the  cluster  means,  where  k  is  the  number  of \nclusters speci\ufb01ed.8 Initial cluster  centers are formed by assigning each case to the cluster with \nthe closest center and then updating the center. An iterative process is then used to \ufb01nd the \ufb01nal \ncluster centers. At each step, cases are grouped into the cluster with the closest center, and the \ncluster centers are recomputed. This process continues until no further changes occur in the centers \nor until the maximum number of iterations is reached. We can also specify cluster centers and the \ncases will be automatically allocated to the selected centers. This will allow clustering new cases \nbased  on  earlier  results.  The  k-means  cluster  analysis  procedure  is  especially  useful  for  a  large \nnumber of cases (i.e., more than 200 cases). The k-means method will produce exactly k different \nclusters of greatest possible distinction.\n\nComputationally, clustering technique can also be thought as an analysis of variance (ANOVA) \nbut in reverse order. The clustering starts with k random clusters, and then moving objects between \nthose clusters with the goal to (i) minimize variability within clusters and (ii) maximize variability \nbetween clusters. In other words, the similarity rules will apply maximally to the members of one \ncluster and minimally to members belonging to the rest of the clusters.9\n\nB.\n\nAssessing Clustering Results Using ANOVA Tests\n\nThe  robustness  of  clustering  results  is  then  examined  by  assessing  the  resulting  groups\u2019 \ndifferences  with  regard  to  independent  and  relevant  variables  that  can  be  attributed  to  both \nunderemployed and fully employed groups. More speci\ufb01cally, this means that the results of grouping \nthe workers into two groups of fully employed and underemployed workers by using the ILO, BPS, \nand proposed cut-off points are assessed by comparing each group with regard to the particular \nvariables concerned. There are 10 variables used in the assessment that consist of general and work-\nrelated variables. The general variables are sociodemographic variables such as gender, urbanity, \nage group, and education attainment, while the work-related variables are something to do with \nthe workers\u2019 economic activities such as looking for a job, types of job looked for, main reason for \n\n8 The k-means algorithm was popularized and re\ufb01ned by Hartigan (1975). The basic operation of that algorithm is that \ngiven a \ufb01xed number of (desired or hypothesized) k clusters, observations are assigned to those clusters so that the \nmeans  across  clusters  (for  all  variables)  are  as  different  from  each  other  as  possible  (see  also Hartigan  and  Wong \n1978). \n\n9 This  is  analogous  to  \u201cANOVA  in  reverse\u201d  in  the  sense  that  the  signi\ufb01cance  test  in  ANOVA  evaluates  between-group \nvariability against within-group variability when computing the signi\ufb01cance test for the hypothesis that the means \nin the groups are different from each other. In k-means clustering, the program tries to move objects (e.g., cases) in \nand out of groups (clusters) to get the most signi\ufb01cant ANOVA results.\n\n12 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION IV\nMAIN RESULTS\n\nlooking for a job, main reason for not looking for a job, willingness to accept a new job offered, \nhaving an additional job, and formality of the job. \n\nThe result assessment is essentially a one-way ANOVA, i.e., to examine whether or not the two \ngroups are statistically different from each other with respect to the mean of the particular variables \nselected. The initial hypothesis (Ho) of this kind of testing is that there is no difference between \nthe two groups\u2019 means with regard to the variables concerned, against the alternative hypothesis \n(Ha), that the means are signi\ufb01cantly different. The main purpose of the study is to ensure that \nthe two groups are statistically different.\n\nIt then follows that a higher value of observed statistics of F and (cid:70)2 (chi-squared) is better \nsince it indicates a better chance to reject the initial hypothesis. In this context,  one can also \nobserve the p-value of the test that shows the observed signi\ufb01cance level. As a rule of thumb, a \nprobability value of less then 5% shows that the groupings are justi\ufb01able for they are statistically \ndifferent at 95% con\ufb01dence interval. Furthermore, in the case where different cut-off points used \nfor  calculating  the  underemployed  and  fully  employed  workers  can  differentiate  the  two  groups \nvery well, which is also re\ufb02ected in the low p-value, the observed values of  (cid:70)2 (cid:3)and F-statistics are \nused as the basis to determine which cut-off point is the best one. Since it is basically a one-sided \nstatistical test, it then follows that the higher the observed values of  (cid:70)2  and F-statistics, the better \nthe cut-off point in differentiating the characteristic of the two groups, i.e., fully employed and \nunderemployed. Therefore, the values of  (cid:70)2  and F-statistics are used as the based for determining \nthe best cut-off point.\n\nC.\n\nData Used \n\nThe  data  used  in  this  study  are  mainly  from  the  Indonesian  Labor  Force  Survey,  known  in \nthe Indonesian language as SAKERNAS (Survey Angkatan Kerja Nasional), revised version for 2003. \nSAKERNAS has been conducted in Indonesia by BPS since 1976. The number of households covered \nin  the  survey  annually  varies  from  50,000\u201395,000    households.  The  main  variables  collected  in \nthe  survey  include  gender,  relation  to  head  of  household,  educational  attainment,  main  activity \nstatus during previous week, working at least one hour, temporarily not working, work experience, \nnumber of work day and work hours of all jobs, occupation of the main job, industrial classi\ufb01cation \nof the main job, employment status of the main job, hours of work in the main job, workdays of \nthe  main  job,  average  wages/salaries,  seeking  work,  availability  for  work,  kinds  of  action  taken \nin seeking work, length of time in seeking work, type of job sought (part-time or full-time), and \nhaving additional jobs.10\n\nIV. MAIN RESULTS\n\nA.\n\nAverage Working Hours\n\nThe  descriptive  statistics  of  working  hours  calculated  from  SAKERNAS  2003  show  that  the \naverage working hours of workers in Indonesia was relatively high, at 39 hours per week, with a \nstandard deviation of 14 hours. The working hours of workers in urban areas are longer and more \n\n10 For more information about the survey including some of its main results, see the BPS website at http://www.bps.\n\ngo.id/sector/employ/index.html.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 13\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nvaried. Statistics in Table 1 show that the working hour is not normally distributed, as can be seen \nfrom the higher value of the kurtosis. In fact, the distribution of working hours is skewed to the \nright as can be seen from the positive value of the skewness indicator. This means that there are \nrelatively more workers working below the average working hours than otherwise.\n\nTABLE 1\nSUMMARY STATISTICS OF WORKING HOURS\n\nWORKING HOURS PER WEEK\n\nStandard deviation\n\nAverage\n\nSkewness\n\nKurtosis\n\nURBAN\n\n44\n\n14.5\n\n0.2\n\n3.8\n\nRURAL\n\n37\n\n13.7\n\n0.3\n\n3.3\n\nTOTAL\n\n39\n\n14.4\n\n0.3\n\n3.5\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\nCompared  to  other  countries  in  Asia,  the  average  working  hour  of  workers  in  Indonesia  is \nnot  the  highest.  An  ILO  study  provides  clear  evidence  that  workers  in  Asia  mostly  work  more \nhours than their counterparts in the other parts of the world (ILO 2005). In general, workers in \ndeveloping countries usually work more hours due to various reasons such as the still important role \nof agriculture and informal sectors in the economy. The relatively high number of average working \nhours in developing countries can also be attributed to the signi\ufb01cant number of low-paying jobs \nthat make workers work much longer hours to meet their needs. This raises an issue of multiple \njob holders, which is also prevalent in developing countries.\n\nFigure 4 shows the weekly average working hours of workers in 10 selected countries on which \ndata is available. The \ufb01gure clearly shows that Asian workers mostly work for longer hours than \nworkers in the Netherlands and Australia. The average working hours in the selected Asian countries \nincluded in the data set range from 39 (in Indonesia) to 47 (in India) hours per week, while the \nworking hour averages in the Netherlands and Australia are about the same at 35 hours per week. \nThe graph also shows that the average working hours in all 10 selected countries are already more \nthan 30 hours per week. Accordingly, the ILO 30-hour per week cut-off point for underemployment \nis signi\ufb01cantly below the averages. This fact further strengthens the argument in this paper that \nthe ILO cut-off point is too low to measure underemployment.\n\nThe evidence that workers in Asia mostly work for long hours can also be seen in the percentage \nof workers working for more than 50 hours per week. Figure 5 shows the percentage of employees \nworking for more than 50 hours per week in 13 selected countries.  As can be seen from the \ufb01gure, \nthese workers with long working hours constitute about 15% of workers in Indonesia and 43% of \nworkers in Cambodia. \n\n14 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION IV\nMAIN RESULTS\n\nFIGURE 4\nAVERAGE WORKING HOURS PER WEEK, 1995\u20132003\n\n41.2\n\n41.5\n\n42.5\n\n39.3\n\n34.5\n\n35.4\n\n44.9\n\n46.3\n\n46.5\n\n46.8\n\nNetherlands Australia Indonesia Philippines Bangladesh\n\nJapan\n\nViet Nam Thailand Singapore\n\nIndia\n\nSource: Calculated from Labor and Social Trends in Asia and the Pacific (ILO 2005).\n\nFIGURE 5\nPERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYED WORKING 50 HOURS OR MORE A WEEK\n\n43.0\n\n42.8\n\n39.6\n\n38.1\n\n36.5\n\n36.1\n\n31.7\n\n29.3\n\n27.4\n\n23.8\n\n22.2\n\n18.1\n\n15.4\n\ns\nr\nu\no\nh\n \ng\nn\ni\nk\nr\no\nW\n\n50.0\n\n45.0\n\n40.0\n\n35.0\n\n30.0\n\n25.0\n\n20.0\n\n15.0\n\n10.0\n\n5.0\n\n0.0\n\ns\nr\nu\no\nh\n \ng\nn\ni\nk\nr\no\nW\n\n50.0\n\n45.0\n\n40.0\n\n35.0\n\n30.0\n\n25.0\n\n20.0\n\n15.0\n\n10.0\n\n5.0\n\n0.0\n\nCambodia\n\nPakistan\n\nThailand\n\nSingapore\n\nMongolia\n\nBangladesh\n\nJapan\n\nSri Lanka\n\nViet Nam Philippines\n\nAustralia\n\nIndonesia\n\nKorea,\nRep. of\n\nNote: For the latest year available.\nSource: Labor and Social Trends in Asia and the Pacific (ILO 2005).\n\nMoreover, there are also some workers excessively working for very long hours. Sugiyarto et \nal. (2006) show that about 8 million workers in Indonesia actually work for more than 60 hours \nper week. Figure 6 clearly indicates that during 1990\u20132003, there were about 6\u20139 million workers \nin this category. This case, unfortunately, is not unique to Indonesia for many of those working for \nmore than 50 hours per week in other selected countries depicted in Figure 5 are actually working \nfor more than 60 hours per week. \n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 15\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nFIGURE 6\nNUMBER OF WORKERS IN INDONESIA BY THEIR WORKING HOURS\n\ns\nn\no\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n8\n\n29\n\n7\n\n7\n\n27\n\n28\n\n11\n\n12\n\n7\n\n27\n\n12\n\n6\n\n25\n\n12\n\n8\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n8\n\n31\n\n33\n\n31\n\n32\n\n35\n\n37\n\n37\n\n37\n\n12\n\n13\n\n13 34 13\n\n14\n\n14\n\n14\n\n15\n\n15\n\n28\n\n27\n\n30\n\n34\n\n31\n\n32\n\n31 34 34\n\n34\n\n32\n\n30\n\n31\n\n31\n\n1990\n\n1991 1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1996 1997\n\n1998 1999\n\n2000\n\n2001 2002\n\n2003\n\n<35 hours\n\n35\u221240 hours\n\n41\u221259 hours\n\n60+ hours\n\nSource: Sugiyarto et al.

The main purpose was to determine \nwhich variable should be used as the base for the clustering analysis. The results reveal that total \nwage is the most signi\ufb01cant determinant variable of the number of hours worked by the employed \ngroup. Therefore, the total wage variable is used as the basis for clustering the workers. Furthermore, \nas was discussed in the methodology section, the K-means clustering analysis is used to group the \nworkers into two statistically different categories. Based on the grouping results, the average working \nhours in each group is calculated and the cut-off point for working full time can be determined.\n\nThe k-clustering results produce two groups of workers. The \ufb01rst group has an average working \nhour of around 44 hours per week while the second group has an average working hour of about \n37 hours per week. Taking these two averages into account, the cut-off point for underemployment \nis therefore 40 hours per week. Table 2 summarizes this result.\n\nTABLE 2\nAVERAGE WORKING HOURS OF EACH GROUP AND THE CUT-OFF POINT FOR UNDEREMPLOYMENT\n\nWorking hours per week\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using the K-means clustering method on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\nGROUP 1\n\nGROUP 2\n\nCUT-OFF POINT\n\n44\n\n37\n\n40\n\nNotice that the resulting cut-off point from the clustering analysis is signi\ufb01cantly higher than \nthe  ILO  and  BPS  cut-off  points  of  30  and  35  hours  per  week.

The graph con\ufb01rms the summary statistics presented in Table 1 that the distribution \nof workers according to their working hours is not normal but skewed to the right11 (i.e., positive \nskewness) as there are relatively more workers working less than the average working hours than \notherwise.  The  \ufb01gure  also  shows  that  there  are  some  outliers  on  number  of  workers  for  certain \nworking hours, which might be due to characteristics of the job such as sector, types, and status. \nThese, however, are not further explored in this paper.\n\nC.\n\nMeasuring Underemployment\n\nOnce the cut-off point for working full-time is determined, underemployment can be estimated \nby  calculating  the  number  of  workers  who  are  working  less  than  the  cut-off  point.  Those  who \nare working above the cut-off point are classi\ufb01ed as fully employed workers. For developing the \nunderemployment indicators, the number of underemployed is divided by the number of total workers \nto represent the underemployment share or, alternatively, by the number of the total labor force \nto represent the underemployment rate.\n\n11 This is a statistical term meaning that the data distribution is skewed to the right of the graph, and not to the right \n\nhand side of the reader.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 17\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nApplying  the  ILO  and  BPS  cut-off  points  on  the  revised  SAKERNAS  2003  data  results  in \nunderemployment shares of 23% and 33% of the total workers, whereas according to the ADB cut-\noff point, the underemployment share should be around 48%. In terms of underemployment rates, \ntheir corresponding rates based on the three cut-off points would be 15%, 21%, and 31% of the \ntotal labor force, respectively. Figure 8 compares these results, which show that the ADB cut-off \npoint produces the highest underemployment share and underemployment rate. \n\nFIGURE 8\nUNDEREMPLOYMENT SHARES AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT RATES CALCULATED USING ILO,\nBPS, AND ADB CUT-OFF POINTS\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nILO\n\nBPS\n\nADB\n\nShares to total workers\n\nShares to total labor force\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\nAs  can  be  seen  from  the  results,  the  difference  in  the  underemployment  shares  and \nunderemployment rates using the three cut-off points is really signi\ufb01cant and cannot just be ignored. \nIn term of underemployment share, the difference between the ILO and ADB results is more than 25 \npercentage points, while the difference between the BPS and ADB results is about 15 percentage \npoints. In term of rates, their differences would be 16 percentage points between the ILO and ADB \nresults, and 10 percentage points between the BPS and ADB results. \n\nTo put these in perspective, one percentage point in the workforce equals 0.93 million workers \nwhile one  percentage point in the labor force constitutes about 1.03 million of  the  labor force. \nThe  total  number  of  workers  and  labor  force  based  on  SAKERNAS  2003  are  about  92.8  million \nworkers  and  102.6  million  of  the  labor  force,  respectively  (ADB  2006).  Therefore,  the  difference \nbetween the ILO and ADB results will be about 23.2 million workers, a staggering number even by \nIndonesian standards. By ILO de\ufb01nitions, these workers will be classi\ufb01ed as fully employed, while \nthe  ADB  measure classi\ufb01es them as underemployed. The estimated number of  underemployed  by \nILO standard is 21.3 million workers, while according to the ADB cut-off point the number would \nbe 44.5 million12 workers.\n\nNotice that the consequences of changes in the cut-off points from 30 to 35 and then from 35 \nto 40 hours per week on the underemployment \ufb01gures have become more considerable. In moving from \n\n12 This number is slightly different with the number of workers working less than 40 hours per week in Figure 6, which is \naround 46 million workers. The main reason is because the calculation of the number of workers during 1990\u20132003 for \n2003 is based on the unrevised SAKERNAS 2003, while this study is based on the revised (latest) version of SAKERNAS\n2003.\n\n18 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION IV\nMAIN RESULTS\n\n30 to 35 hours per week, a 1-hour increase in the cut-off point will increase about 2.5 percentage \npoints the underemployment share, while the same 1-hour increase in moving from 35 to 40 hours \nper week results in a higher increase of 3 percentage points in the underemployment share. In term \nof rates, the increases are from 1.6 to 2 percentage points, respectively. Therefore, a 1-hour increase \nin the cut-off point results in an increase of 3 percentage points in the underemployment share \nand 2 percentage points in the underemployment rate. Table 3 summarizes the underemployment \nand full employment shares and rates calculated using the three different cut-off points.\n\nSAKERNAS also collects information about worker economic activities such as looking for a \njob, having an additional job, and accepting a new job offered. Table 4 summarizes the average \nworking hours of workers with these additional economic activities. It seems that looking for a job \nfor a worker is a good indication of underutilization, especially with regard to the hours that the \nworkers would like to work and actually work. This shows that the average working hours of those \nwho are looking for a job is lower than the ones not looking for a job. The average working hour \nof workers still looking for a job is about 37.5 hours per week, lower than the average of those \nnot looking for job, which is around 39 hours per week. A similar pattern can be observed with \nworkers who have an additional job, whether or not they are looking for a job.\n\nFrom Table 4, one can calculate the massive scale of the underemployment volume represented \nby the number  of  hours needed to make all underemployed workers fully employed. The  average \nworking hours of underemployed by ADB standards, i.e., those who are working less than 40 hours \nper week, is only 28 hours per week. As their share in the workforce is 48% (Figure 8), this means \nthat 48% of the existing workers need to work for at least 12 hours more per week to become fully \nemployed. Therefore, in terms of working hours, the underemployment volume in Indonesia is about \n534.5 million working hours, which is calculated by multiplying the number of underemployed with \nthe average shortfall  share  (48% x 92.8 million x 12 hours). Using 40 hours per week as the cut-\noff point for a full-time worker, the underemployment volume of 534.5 million working hours will \nbe equivalent to 13.4 million full-time jobs.\n\nTABLE 3\nUNDEREMPLOYMENT BY DIFFERENT CUT-OFF POINTS\n\nSHARES TO TOTAL WORKERS\n\nSHARES TO TOTAL LABOR FORCE\n\nCUT-OFF POINTS\nILO\n\nBPS\n\nADB\n\nCLASSIFICATION\nUnderemployed\nFully employed\nUnderemployed\nFully employed\nUnderemployed\nFully employed\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\n22.6\n\n77.4\n\n32.8\n\n67.2\n\n47.8\n\n52.2\n\n14.6\n50.0\n21.2\n43.4\n30.9\n33.7\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 19\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nTABLE 4\nAVERAGE WORKING HOURS PER WEEK OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORKERS (HOURS)\n\nAVERAGE WORKING HOURS OF\n\nWORKERS\nLOOKING\nFOR A JOB\n\nWORKERS\nWITH AN\nADDITIONAL\nJOB\n\nWORKERS\nWITH\nADDITIONAL\nJOB AND\nLOOKING FOR\nA JOB\n\nWORKERS WITH\nADDITIONAL JOB,\nNOT LOOKING\nBUT ACCEPTING\nNEW JOB\nOFFERED\n\n23.0\n\n46.2\n\n27.1\n\n47.8\n\n31.2\n\n50.4\n\n43.6\n\n21.8\n\n45.1\n\n25.8\n\n47.0\n\n29.6\n\n49.7\n\n41.3\n\n23.1\n\n46.0\n\n27.0\n\n47.7\n\n31.4\n\n50.6\n\n43.4\n\nCUT-OFF\nPOINTS\n\nILO\n\nBPS\n\nADB\n\nOverall\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nUnderemployed\n\nFully employed\n\nUnderemployed\n\nFully employed\n\nUnderemployed\n\nFully employed\n\nWORKERS\n\n20.9\n\n45.4\n\n24.2\n\n47.5\n\n28.0\n\n50.7\n\n39.3\n\n20.3\n\n44.8\n\n23.4\n\n47.1\n\n26.6\n\n50.1\n\n37.5\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\nD.\n\nCharacteristics of the Underemployed\n\nFigure 9 panels (a) to (c) show the underemployment rates among the workers by general socio-\neconomic-demographic variables such as age, education attainment, sector, gender, and urban/rural, \ncalculated using the three different cut-off points of ILO, BPS, and ADB. The \ufb01gures show that the \nunderemployment rate is relatively more prevalent among males, old-age (45-65), low-educated, \ninformal workers, and rural areas. This pattern is consistent across the three different cut-off points, \neven though the magnitudes of the difference among the three are not the same. \n\nComparing  the  underemployment  rates  across  different  cut-off  points  and  for  work-related \nvariables such as reason for looking or not looking for a job, type of job looked for, accepting new \njob offered, and having additional job, a similar pattern can also be seen in Figure 10 panels (a) \nto (c). The overall results show that most underemployed have no additional job and they are not \nsatis\ufb01ed with their existing job. For those looking for a job, they are mostly looking for part-time \njobs, while those who are not looking for a job still accept any new job offered. The main reason \nfor not looking for a job is the feeling of impossibility to get the job or discouragement. \n\n20 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION IV\nMAIN RESULTS\n\ne\nt\na\nR\n\ne\nt\na\nR\n\ne\nt\na\nR\n\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\nFIGURE 9\nUNDEREMPLOYMENT RATES AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS OF WORKERS BASED ON\nDIFFERENT CUT-OFF POINTS AND GENERAL VARIABLES (PERCENT)\n\n(a) ILO\n\n(b) BPS\n\n(c) ADB\n\nUrbanity\n\nAge\n\nEducation\n\nSector\n\nGender\n\nUrban Rural\n\n15\u221230 31\u221245 46\u221265\n\nFormal\n\nInformal\n\nMale Female\n\nPrimary Non-\nPrimary\n\nUrbanity\n\nAge\n\nEducation\n\nGender\n\nSector\n\nUrban Rural\n\n15\u221230 31\u221245 46\u221265\n\nFormal\n\nInformal\n\nMale Female\n\nPrimary Non-\nprimary\n\nUrbanity\n\nAge\n\nEducation\n\nSector\n\nGender\n\nUrban Rural\n\n15\u221230 31\u221245 46\u221265\n\nFormal\n\nInformal\n\nMale Female\n\nPrimary Non-\nprimary\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 21\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nFIGURE 10\nUNDEREMPLOYMENT RATES AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS OF WORKERS BASED ON\nDIFFERENT CUT-OFF POINTS AND WORK-RELATED VARIABLES (PERCENT)\n\n(a) ILO\n\n(b) BPS\n\n(c) ADB\n\nFull-\ntime\n\nPart-\ntime\n\nType of job \nlooked for\n\nOther\nreasons\n\nJob is \nnot\nsatisfying\n\nReasons for \nlooking\nfor job\n\nDiscour-\naged\n\nOther\nreasons\n\nReasons for \nnot looking \nfor job\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nAccepting \nnew job\noffered\n\nAdditional \njob\n\nFull-\ntime\n\nPart-\ntime\n\nType of job \nlooked for\n\nOther\nreasons\n\nJob is \nnot\nsatisfying\n\nReasons for \nlooking\nfor job\n\nDiscour-\naged\n\nOther\nreasons\n\nReasons for \nnot looking \nfor job\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nAccepting \nnew job\noffered\n\nAdditional \njob\n\nFull-\ntime\n\nPart-\ntime\n\nType of job \nlooked for\n\nOther\nreasons\n\nJob is \nnot\nsatisfying\n\nReasons for \nlooking\nfor job\n\nDiscour-\naged\n\nOther\nreasons\n\nReasons for \nnot looking \nfor job\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nAccepting \nnew job \noffered\n\nAdditional \njob\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\ne\nt\na\nR\n\ne\nt\na\nR\n\ne\nt\na\nR\n\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n22 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION IV\nMAIN RESULTS\n\nThe  general  socioeconomic  characteristics  of  the  fully  employed  group  are  completely  the \nopposite of the underemployed (Tables 5 and 6). Most fully employed workers are female, work in \nurban areas, aged 31\u201345 years old, have more education, and work in the formal sector. On the other \nhand, the characteristics of the fully employed workers are not different from the underemployed \nespecially with regard to the work-related variables. The only exception is the criterion having an \nadditional job, which was prevalent among the fully employed workers. For the remaining variables, \nthe fully employed group is also not satis\ufb01ed with their existing job; for those who are looking \nfor a job, they are mostly looking for a part-time job; while those not looking are still accepting \nnew jobs offered. Again, the main reason for not looking for a job is the feeling of impossibility \nto get a job or discouragement.\n\nThe overall picture suggests a poor working condition for workers in Indonesia. Despite their \nrelatively long working hours, most of them are still not happy with their jobs, making them look \nfor other jobs. Those who are not looking for a job are the discouraged workers, who realize that \nthey will not get any.\n\nTABLE 5\nUNDEREMPLOYMENT AND FULL EMPLOYMENT RATES (PERCENT)\n\nILO\n\nBPS\n\nADB\n\nUNDEREMPLOYED FULLY EMPLOYED UNDEREMPLOYED FULLY EMPLOYED UNDEREMPLOYED FULLY EMPLOYED\n\nGENERAL\nVARIABLES\n\nUrbanity\n\nAge\n\nUrban\n\nRural\n\n15\u201330\n\n31\u201345\n\n46\u201365\n\nEducation\n\nPrimary\n\nNonprimary\n\nSector\n\nInformal\n\nFormal\n\nGender\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\nTotal\n\n7.8\n\n19.6\n\n12.4\n\n14.6\n\n19.5\n\n19.9\n\n9.3\n\n16.0\n\n10.9\n\n22.0\n\n6.4\n\n14.6\n\n50.4\n\n49.7\n\n38.5\n\n63.5\n\n53.5\n\n49.0\n\n50.9\n\n35.3\n\n88.0\n\n48.5\n\n51.6\n\n50.0\n\n12.1\n\n27.8\n\n17.0\n\n22.5\n\n28.5\n\n27.7\n\n14.7\n\n22.1\n\n18.8\n\n30.4\n\n11.0\n\n21.2\n\n46.1\n\n41.4\n\n33.9\n\n55.7\n\n44.5\n\n41.2\n\n45.5\n\n29.2\n\n80.1\n\n40.1\n\n47.0\n\n43.4\n\n20.3\n\n38.5\n\n23.7\n\n34.9\n\n40.2\n\n37.5\n\n24.2\n\n29.6\n\n34.2\n\n40.6\n\n20.0\n\n30.9\n\n37.9\n\n30.7\n\n27.2\n\n43.3\n\n32.8\n\n31.5\n\n36.0\n\n21.8\n\n64.7\n\n29.9\n\n38.0\n\n33.7\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 23\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nTABLE 6\nUNDEREMPLOYMENT AND FULL EMPLOYMENT RATES (PERCENT)\n\nILO\n\nBPS\n\nADB\n\nUNDEREMPLOYED\n\nEMPLOYED UNDEREMPLOYED\n\nEMPLOYED UNDEREMPLOYED\n\nFULLY\n\nFULLY\n\nFULLY\nEMPLOYEd\n\nWORK-RELATED\nVARIABLES\n\nType of job looked for\n\nFull-time\n\nPart-time\n\nReasons for looking \nfor a job\n\nJob is not satisfying\n\nOther reasons\n\nReasons for not \nlooking for a job\n\nImpossible to get \n(discouraged)\n\nAcceptance of new \njob offered\n\nPresence of additional \njobs\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n14.2\n\n15.1\n\n24.7\n\n14.3\n\n16.6\n\n13.4\n\n10.4\n\n22.9\n\n33.3\n\n36.2\n\n76.8\n\n32.7\n\n60.0\n\n42.9\n\n89.6\n\n74.1\n\n18.9\n\n21.3\n\n33.5\n\n19.6\n\n23.9\n\n19.3\n\n19.5\n\n32.9\n\n28.5\n\n30.0\n\n68.0\n\n27.5\n\n52.7\n\n37.0\n\n80.5\n\n64.0\n\n24.5\n\n28.3\n\n44.3\n\n25.7\n\n34.3\n\n28.3\n\n29.3\n\n42.9\n\n22.9\n\n22.9\n\n57.2\n\n21.4\n\n42.3\n\n28.0\n\n70.7\n\n54.0\n\n20.0\n\n61.6\n\n28.8\n\n52.9\n\n41.6\n\n40.1\n\nOther reasons\n\n13.8\n\n49.4\n\n20.2\n\n43.0\n\n29.6\n\n33.6\n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n\nE.\n\nANOVA Tests for Assessing the Classi\ufb01cation Results\n\nAs discussed in the methodology section, the robustness of the results of classifying workers \ninto fully employed and underemployed using the three different cut-off points of ILO, BPS, and \nADB are assessed using ANOVA tests. In doing so, some independent variables are used as a base \nfor the test. The variables can be classi\ufb01ed into two categories, namely sociodemographic variables \nsuch  as  gender,  urbanity,  education,  and  age;  as  well  as  variables  related  to  work  or  economic \nactivities such as formality of the existing job, having additional jobs, reasons for looking for jobs, \ntypes  of  jobs  looked  for,  reasons  for  not  looking  for  jobs,  and  willingness  to  accept  a  new  job \noffered to those who are not looking for jobs. Therefore, there are altogether 10 variables used in \nthe assessment. \n\nTable 7 summarizes the test results of associations between fully employed and underemployed \nworkers based on the three

 results  suggest  that  all  three  cut-off  points  can  differentiate  very  well  full \nemployment from underemployment as can be seen from their statistically signi\ufb01cant statistics of \n(cid:70)(cid:21) and F. In fact, the  p-values of all the tests are already zero, which is why they are excluded \nfrom the summary table. In other words, all initial hypotheses that there is no difference in the \ncharacteristics between fully employed and underemployed workers with respect to the 10 variables \nconcerned are all rejected. This means that the characteristics of underemployed and fully employed \nworkers are signi\ufb01cantly different. \n\nMoreover, comparing the (cid:70)(cid:21) and F-statistics across different cut-off points shows that the results \nof applying the BPS cut-off point are better than those of ILO, and that the results of applying \nthe ADB cut-off point are superior to those of BPS and ILO. The summary table shows that ADB \n\n26 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION V\nCHOW TEST AND RECURSIVE DYNAMIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS\n\ncut-off point results perform best in the 6 out of 10 variables used in the assessment. This best \nperformance is indicated by the highest values of the (cid:70)(cid:21) and F-statistics. The only exception is on \nthe results on the variables gender, education, having an additional job, and formality of the job. \nIn the gender and having additional job variables, the ILO cut-off point performs better than ADB \nwhile in the other two variables the BPS cut-off point results are the best. \n\nV. CHOW TEST AND RECURSIVE DYNAMIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS\n\nAnother way to determine and/or assess the cut-off point is by using econometric methods. \nThis is conducted \ufb01rst by establishing the economic relationship between working hours and some \ndeterminant variables, and then conducting regression analysis for different subsamples of workers \nbased on their working hours. The main purpose is to \ufb01nd out the best cut-off point of working hours \nsuch that the workers can be best divided into two groups of fully employed and underemployed. \n\nIn general, the empirical model of working hours can take the form:\n\nWH\ni\n\n(cid:29) (\n\n,\nf DV CV D\ni\ni\n\n,\n\ni\n\n)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere WH is the working hours, DV is the determinant variable, CV is the control variable, and D is \nthe dummy variable that takes into account variations in factors excluded in the model. The dummy \nvariable can take the form of additive and multiplicative dummy variables, depending on the data \ndistribution  and estimation results. For exploratory purposes and to further strengthen the case \nin \ufb01nding the best cut-off point, the regression model is estimated in both cases of bivariate and \nmultiple variable models. The results indicate that the best bivariate model is in the form of:\n\nWorking hours = cons + b1*wage_tot + b2*group_ue + b3*group_ue*wage_tot + e\n\nMeanwhile, the best multiple regression model is as follows:\n\nWorking  hours  =  cons  +  b1*wage_tot  +  b2*look_job  +  b3*add_job  +  b4*urb  +  b5*sex  + \nb6*group_ue + e\n\nwhere: \n\nwage_tot  =  total  wages  both  cash  and  kind;  look_job  =  looking  for  job  dummy;  add_job  =\nadditional job dummy, urb = urban/rural dummy; sex = male/female dummy; and group_ue = \nunderemployed group de\ufb01ned by working less than 25\u201345 hours per week.\n\nBased on the best empirical model that can be developed from the data sets, two methods \nfor assessing and/or determining the cut-off point can be used. These methods are the Chow test \nand the recursive dynamic regression technique. \n\nA.\n\nChow Test\n\nThe Chow test is commonly used to examine the parameter instability of a model across the \nwhole  sample.  The  main  question  here  is  whether  the  relationship  depicted  in  the  model  holds \nover  the  whole  sample.  To  answer  the  question,  the  sample  is  divided  into  two  groups  and  the \nmodel is then run on the subsamples and total sample to see if there is any change observed in \n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92 27\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nthe parameter estimates. This is the underlying process of the Chow test. Formally, the hypothesis-\ntesting problem can be summarized as follows:\n\nConsider the linear model Y = X(cid:69)+(cid:72). As there are two sub samples, (1) and (2), in which the \n\nparameters are not necessarily the same, therefore:\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nYi = Xi (cid:69)1+(cid:72)i\nYi = Xi (cid:69)2+(cid:72)i\n\ni (cid:143) (1)\n\ni (cid:143) (2)\n\nThe hypothesis-testing in this context is Ho : (cid:69)1 = (cid:69)2, and the total number of observations \n\nis n = n1 +n2.\n\nThe  Chow  test  is  actually  an  application  of  the  F-test,  since  the  regression\u2019s  sum  squared \nerrors (RSS) from the three regressions for each subsample and for the total sample follow the F\ndistribution. Under Ho    \n\nRSS RSS\n(\n(cid:13)\nRSS\nRSS\n(\n2\n1\n\nRSS\n)/\n(cid:13)\nJ\n2\nn\nn\n)/(\n2\n1\n\n(cid:11)\n\n(cid:11)\n\n(cid:13)\n\nK\n2\nk\n\n)\n\n(cid:157)\n\nF\nk n\n,\n1\n\n(cid:11)\n\nn\n2\n\n(cid:13)\n\nk\n2\n\nThe application of the Chow test in this study is to examine if the two groups of fully employed \nand  underemployed  workers  have  different  characteristics  with  respect  to  some  independent \nvariables.  The  difference  is  re\ufb02ected  in  the  parameters  of  the  variables  concerned  across  the \ndifferent groups. \n\nTherefore  based  on  the  best  bivariate  and  multiple  regressions,  a  series  of  Chow  tests  is \nconducted by running the models on the total sample as well as on the subsamples, which were \nformed  by  dividing  the  total  sample  into  two  groups  using  different  cut-off  points  of  working \nhours. Accordingly, the level of working hours that corresponds to the highest level of parameter \nchange detected by the Chow test should be used as the cut-off point for underemployment, for \nthat implies  that  the two groups of workers have the most statistically signi\ufb01cant difference  in \nthe regression parameters.\n\nB.\n\nRecursive Regression Technique\n\nThe recursive regression technique is conducted by running a series of regressions recursively, \ni.e.,  starting  from a certain subsample and then adding a new sample continuously. A record of \nthe  regression  statistics  is  compiled  to  examine  if  there  is  any  signi\ufb01cant  shift  in  the  model\u2019s \nparameters. \n\nThe  number  of  working  hours  on  which  the  structural  break  is  identi\ufb01ed  by  the  Chow  test \nand/or recursive regression can then be used as a proxy for the cut-off point for fully employed and \nunderemployed workers. Furthermore, assuming that the cut-off point of working hours would be in \nthe range of 25\u201345 hours per week, the Chow test and recursive regression analysis are conducted \nonly  within  this band of working hours. Therefore, a possibility that the cut-off point would be \nbelow 25 or above 45 hours per week is dropped in the analysis.\n\nChow  test  results  for  the  bivariate  and  multivariate  models  further  con\ufb01rm  that  40  hours \nper  week  is  a  very  good  cut-off  point  for  determining  underemployment  and  full  employment. \n\nC. \n\nTest Results\n\n28 MARCH 2007\n\n\fSECTION V\nCHOW TEST AND RECURSIVE DYNAMIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS\n\nTables 8 and 9 summarize the regression statistics conducted for the Chow tests. Figure 11 shows \nthe  regression  result  statistics  of  the  recursive  regressions,  namely  the  F-statistics  of  both  the \nbivariate  and  multiple  regression  models,  and  the  adjusted  R-squared.  As  can  be  seen  from  the \nsummary tables, the 40 hours per week cut-off point produces the highest F-statistics in the Chow \ntest  in  both  bivariate  and  multiple  regressions.  This  means  that  the  40  hours  per  week  cut-off \ncan  differentiate  the  two  groups  of  workers  most  strongly,  as  re\ufb02ected  in  the  highest  change \ndetected in the regression parameter. The 40 hours per week cut-off point also produces the highest\nF-statistic, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared in the regression estimates. All these indicate that \nthe model with this subsample is the most powerful one in explaining the relationship captured \nby the model. Moreover, the lowest MSE of the 40 hours per week cut-off point further indicates \nthat the regression with this subsample is also the most ef\ufb01cient. Therefore, the 40 hours per week \ncut-off point is indeed the best, compared to the cut off-points of 30 and 35 hours per week. \n\nThe recursive regression results of the bivariate and multivariate models also con\ufb01rm that the \n40 hours per week is the best cut-off point for determining underemployment and full employment \n(see Figure 12). \n\nTABLE 8\nSUMMARY CHOW TEST STATISTICS OF

CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATION\n\nUnemployment and underemployment are the most pressing problems in Asia today as re\ufb02ected \nby the widespread underutilization rate of about 29% of the total labor force. The underutilization \nrate could have been higher if a better measure were used in the calculation. The standard labor \nforce framework currently in use worldwide is biased toward counting a labor force as employed \nrather than as unemployed against the backdrop that most of the labor force in developing countries \ncannot afford to be completely unemployed. This systematically undervalues the full extent of the \nunemployment problem, which makes the introduction of underemployment indicators necessary to \ncomplement the open unemployment indicator and to better measure underutilization. \n\nThe  current  underemployment  measurement,  however,  also  has  conceptual  and  practical \nproblems  that  systematically  understate  the  underemployment  level.  The  existing  guidelines  to \nmeasure time-related underemployment using the cut-off point for full-time work set the threshold \ntoo low, resulting in a considerable under representation of underemployment, which has serious \npolicy implications. \n\nThis  study  shows  the  consequences  of  the  measures  used  and  suggests  a  better  way  to \ndetermine the cut-off point and therefore measure underemployment. The cluster method is adopted \nto  determine  the  better  cut-off  point  and  the  robustness  of  its  application  results  are  assessed \nusing ANOVA tests. The Chow test and recursive dynamic regression are also employed to determine \nand/or assess the best cut-off point for measuring underemployment.\n\nThe consequence of using an incorrect cut-off point for underemployment is very signi\ufb01cant \nsince a small change in the cut-off point will result in a much bigger change in underemployment \nrate and incidence. In the Indonesian context, for instance, applying the ILO and BPS cut-off points \nof  30  and  35  hours  of  work  per  week  will  result  in  underemployment  shares  of  23%  and  33%, \nrespectively. Meanwhile, according to the ADB cut-off point of 40 hours per week, underemployment \nshould be around 48% of the total workers. In term of underemployment rates, the numbers would \nbe 15%, 21%, and 31% of the total labor force, respectively. Underemployment shares according \nto ILO and ADB results differ by more than 25 percentage points, while between ADB and BPS the \ndifference is about 15 percentage points. In term of underemployment rates, their differences would \nbe 16 and 10 percentage points, respectively. \n\nOverall, a 1-hour increase in the cut-off point results in an increase of 3 percentage points \nin  the  underemployment  share  and  2  percentage  points  in  the  underemployment  rate.  During \n1990\u20132003, there were about 11\u201315 million workers who were working between 35 and 40 hours \nper  week  in  Indonesia  (Sugiyarto  et  al.  2006).  They  could  be  misclassi\ufb01ed  as  fully  employed \nworkers  according  to the BPS de\ufb01nition. This misclassi\ufb01cation cannot just be ignored for it  has \nserious policy implications on the effort to promote full, productive, and freely chosen employment. \nMoreover, the average working hours of the underemployed by the ADB standard in Indonesia is \nonly 28 hours per week. Considering about 48% of workers are underemployed and the number of \nworkers is about 92.8 million, the volume of underemployment in Indonesia is about 534.5 million \nworking hours. This is equivalent to 13.4 million full-time jobs that must be generated just to make \nthe underemployed fully employed.\n\nLearning from the Indonesian and Philippine cases, the cut-off point seems better determined \nat the individual country level to consider country-speci\ufb01c characteristics. If a comparison across \ncountries is needed, a 40 hours per week cut-off point is better than the currently used ILO standard \n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 92  33\n\n\fMEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHING THE CUT-OFF POINT\nGUNTUR SUGIYARTO\n\nof 30 hours per week. The consequence of misclassifying the underemployed as fully employed is \nmore serious than otherwise. Moreover, the more recent approach at the international level is the \npromotion  of  a  40-hour  workweek  as  a  standard  to  be  realized  by  ILO  member  states,  and  that \n40-hour workweek is now the most prevalent weekly hour standard (McCann 2005). The 40-hour \nworkweek is also in line with the Forty-Hour Week Convention 1935 No. 47, and the reduction of \nhours of work recommendation 1962 No. 116. \n\nREFERENCES\n\nADB.  2005.
