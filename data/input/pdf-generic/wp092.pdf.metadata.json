Background\nUnemployment and underemployment are the most pressing problems in Asia today. Using \nvarious estimates, out of a 1.7 billion labor force, around 500 million are either unemployed or \nunderemployed (ADB 2005). This re\ufb02ects an underutilization rate of about 29% of the total labor \nforce. The underutilization problem shown by the statistic might, however, just be the tip of the \niceberg since higher underutilization could have been detected if a better measure of unemployment \nand underemployment were used. \nTo start with, the standard labor force framework (LFF) currently in use worldwide may not \nnecessarily be always appropriate for developing countries. The LFF de\ufb01nes working as conducting \neconomic activities for at least one hour during a reference period. This working concept encompasses \nall types of employment situations: formal, informal, casual, short-time, and all forms of irregular \njobs. Accordingly, during the reference period,1 the worker could be working in self-employment,2\nfamily business, business enterprise, or even temporarily not working for a number of acceptable \nreasons.3 On the other hand, the unemployed comprises those who are not working, are available \nfor work, and looking for a job. The employed and unemployed constitute the labor force.\nThe LFF seems very straightforward but its implementation across countries varies considerably. \nMoreover, its implementation in developing countries has resulted in unemployment \ufb01gures that \nmany believe to be too low to represent reality. The LFF is criticized for being essentially biased \ntoward counting a person as employed rather than as unemployed. As a result, it systematically \nundervalues the full extent of the unemployment problem. This situation is indeed unfortunate \ngiven that the LFF was introduced in the 1950s to rectify the very same problem encountered by \nthe previous approach of \u201cgainfully working\u201d, in which a working-age individual is classi\ufb01ed as \ngainfully or not gainfully working depending on whether he/she has a profession, an occupation \nor trade, but with no speci\ufb01cations for time reference and proof of existence of working activity. \nBox 1 summarizes this issue in more detail.\n1 The reference period of a labor force survey is usually one week prior to a survey date.\n2 Employers, own-account workers, and unpaid family workers are considered as self-employed.\n3 Persons temporarily not at work because of illness or injury; holiday or vacation; strike or lock-out; educational or \ntraining leave; maternity or parental leave; reduction in economic activity; temporary disorganization or suspension \nof work due to such reasons as bad weather, mechanical or electrical breakdown, or shortage of raw materials or fuels; \nor other temporary absence with or without leave should be considered as in paid employment provided they have a \nformal job attachment.", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nBOX 1\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE LABOR FORCE FRAMEWORK\nMeasuring labor utilization is important for at least two reasons: \ufb01rst, labor is a productive input \nthat cannot be stored and should not be wasted; and second, ownership of productive inputs determines \nincome, and many people in developing countries have only labor as their income source. \nThere have been different approaches used for measuring labor utilization. The gainful worker \napproach (GWA) was \ufb01rst used in the United States until the depression in 1930s. A new approach was then \nneeded as unemployment and underemployment became pressing problems that could not adequately be \nmeasured by GWA. Accordingly, the labor force framework (LFF) was introduced. By 1950, both approaches \nwere made available by the United Nations to all countries, but by 1970, the United Nations through its \nWorld Census Program abandoned the former approach and pushed for the use of the latter.\nIn GWA, a working-age individual, minimum 10 or 15 years old, is classi\ufb01ed as gainfully or not \ngainfully working depending on whether he/she has a profession, an occupation, or trade. There is no \ntime reference speci\ufb01ed in this approach, nor is proof required for existence of any working activity. \nAccordingly, the approach may systematically underestimate unemployment by counting those with a \nprofession, an occupation, or trade but already retired/without work as gainfully working.\nOn the other hand, the LFF is based on economic activity criteria rather than economic status. \nIn this concept, a working-age individual is classi\ufb01ed as working if he/she has conducted an economic \nactivity for at least one hour during the reference period. For those who are not working and looking \nfor a job, they are classi\ufb01ed as unemployed. The employed and unemployed constitute the labor force. \nTherefore, the working-age population can be classi\ufb01ed as either labor force or nonlabor force. \nAnother main reason for the understated unemployment problem above is because most of \nthe labor force in developing countries simply cannot afford to be completely unemployed. They \nmust take on whatever job is available to sustain their living. This is very different from the notion \nof \u201c\u2018having a job\u201d\u2018 or \u201c\u2018working\u201d\u2018 in developed countries, in which the job in general really pays, \nproviding a guarantee for a decent standard of living. In addition, the absence of unemployment \nbene\ufb01ts and the general condition of households in developing countries\u2014with their low income \nand saving\u2014further strengthen the case that most people in developing countries simply cannot \nafford to be voluntarily unemployed. In this context, therefore, a comparison of unemployment rates \nbetween developed and developing countries could be problematic given their different natures of \nemployment and unemployment. This is true even if they use of the same concept and de\ufb01nition \nof employment and unemployment. Moreover, there is also a statistical reason that the rates are \ncalculated from different labor force surveys, which have different scope and coverage, concept and \nde\ufb01nition of variables, and survey\u2019s reference period. This will make their results less comparable.\nBox 2 further highlights some conceptual problems in the LFF.\n2 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONI\nINTRODUCTION\nBOX 2\nCONCEPTUAL PROBLEMS IN THE LABOR FORCE FRAMEWORK\nThe LFF provides a comprehensive and consistent system of classifying the working-age population. \nHowever, the types of labor utilization included in the approach are more suited to the modern sectors in \ndeveloped countries. Accordingly, the approach may not adequately capture labor utilization in developing \ncountries, where the economy is still characterized by large agricultural and informal sectors (Myrdal 1968, \nHauser 1974, NSO 2007).\nAn additional problem lies in the LFF implementation. Results of classifying individuals into \ndifferent categories of employment depend on the types and structure of the questions used in the survey, \ninstructions to enumerators, data collection procedures, data processing, and other factors. There is also \na lack of expertise and resources to undertake labor utilization measurement in developing countries. In \nsome cases, conducting labor force surveys on a regular basis is even dif\ufb01cult in some countries.\nMyrdal (1968) further highlights the inapplicability of the labor force approach to developing \ncountries. The framework does not distinguish between labor reserve and readily available labor surplus, \nand measures labor underutilization only in terms of readily available surplus as described by unemployment \nand underemployment. In some developing countries, the labor reserve is larger than the readily available \nsurplus, therefore the extent of idleness or underutilization is greater than what is measured by the \nlabor force approach. Accordingly, the problem of labor underutilization is not only unemployment and \nunderemployment but also the presence of idle labor reserve. This implies that the full employment of \nlabor will require a set of policies that will change attitudes and institutions with regard to employment \nand work.\nB. Why an Underemployment Indicator is Needed\nTo overcome the problem of understated open unemployment highlighted above, an \nunderemployment indicator is introduced. The main purpose is to derive more representative indicators \nof underutilization by complementing the open unemployment indicator with an underemployment \nindicator. As in the case of open unemployment, a higher underemployment level indicates a \nmore serious employment problem, and vice versa. In this context, it is implicitly assumed that \nthe underemployed also needs a job, a \u201cbetter\u201d job. There is also a good reason to combine the \nopen employment and underemployment indicators since both represent underutilization of the \nlabor force. ADB (2005), for instance, shows how the two indicators are combined to show the \nunderutilization trend in the Philippines. Box 3 summarizes some alternative approaches of the \nlabor force framework.\nThe resolution concerning statistics on economically active population, employment, \nunemployment, and underemployment adopted by the 13th International Conference of Labor \nStatisticians in October 1982, stipulated that each country should develop a comprehensive system \nof statistics on economic activity to provide an adequate statistical base for various users. In doing \nso, each country should consider the speci\ufb01c national needs and circumstances for both short-\nterm and long-term needs. The economically active population comprises all persons providing the \nsupply of labor for the production and processing of economic goods and services for the market, \nfor barter, or for own consumption. \nMore speci\ufb01cally, the resolution concerning the measurement of underemployment and inadequate \nemployment situations, adopted by the 16th International Conference of Labor Statisticians in October \n1998, concluded that statistics on underemployment and indicators of inadequate employment \nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 3", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nsituations should be used to complement statistics on employment, open unemployment, and inactivity, \nincluding the circumstances of the economically active population in a country. The primary objective \nof measuring underemployment and inadequate employment situations is to improve the analysis of \nemployment problems and to contribute toward formulating and evaluating short-term and long-term \npolicies and measures designed to promote full, productive, and freely chosen employment. This \nwas speci\ufb01ed in the Employment Policy Convention (No. 122) and Recommendations (No. 122 and \nNo. 169) adopted by the International Labor Conference in 1964 and 1984. The main issue here is \nhow to de\ufb01ne and then measure underemployment. \nBOX 3\nALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO THE LABOR FORCE FRAMEWORK\nThere have been a number of alternative approaches attempted to remedy the de\ufb01ciencies of the \nlabor force approach. Myrdal (1968) outlined an alternative approach to labor utilization measurement \nin developing countries by measuring the difference between total labor input of the labor force with \ncomplete participation at an assumed standard of work duration, and labor input from actual participation \nexpressed as a ratio of the former. \nAnother alternative approach was developed by the Organization of Demographic Associates (ODA) \nin Southeast Asia. The ODA approach involves classifying the working-age population into four categories: \nworking for wages or pro\ufb01t, working outside the household without monetary payment, working inside \nthe household without monetary payment, and others. These categories are then further classi\ufb01ed into \nwork type subcategories. In addition, the categories and subcategories are subdivided into agriculture and \nnonagriculture. Therefore, three criteria are used to classify the working-age population, namely (i)working \nin the monetary or nonmonetary sector, (ii)inside or outside the household, and (iii)agriculture or \nnonagriculture (Hauser 1974).\nOshima and Hidayat (1974) suggested a different approach for labor utilization measurement for an \neconomy characterized by labor shortage and/or labor surplus. In countries beset by labor shortage, an \nemployment status survey that discriminates those with and without jobs would give more information on \nthe employed. In the labor-surplus developing countries, an unemployment status type of survey would \nbe more appropriate to capture the different dimensions of labor underutilization.\nHauser (1974) proposed a measure of labor underutilization in developing countries by classifying \nthe workforce into those utilized adequately and those inadequately. The latter is classi\ufb01ed further by \nits cause of underutilization, namely, unemployment, inadequate work hours, inadequate income, and \nmismatch of occupation and education/training. The adequately utilized workers are the residual of the \ntotal work force. This classi\ufb01cation reveals better the extent of underutilization and its dimensions. \nThis is very important since each underutilization type may require different policy interventions. Labor \nunderutilization due to unemployment and inadequate working hours may require job creation. However, \nunderutilization due to inadequate income would call for policies in human resource development and \nproduction technology improvements. The mismatch case would require policy rationalizing, individual skill \nformation decisions both in the formal and informal education sectors, and human resources planning.\nC. Main Purpose of the Paper\nThis paper examines how the cut-off point used in determining underemployment can be very \ncritical in the resulting indicator and therefore in its policy implications. The cut-off point is critical \nbecause there are many workers working around the cut-off point such that a small change in the \ncut-off point will result in a much bigger change in the resulting indicator. Therefore, it is very \nimportant to derive the right cut-off point to reduce the risk of undermining the underemployment \nproblem. \n4 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONII\nDEFINITIONAND MEASUREMENTOFUNDEREMPLOYMENT\nTheoretically, the cut-off point should be determined in such a way that it can signi\ufb01cantly \ndifferentiate two groups of underemployed and fully employed with regard to some important \ncharacteristics relevant to both groups. This study tries to make a contribution in this area by \ndemonstrating how the cut-off point can be determined in a more systematic way, i.e., by employing \na clustering method to determine the \u201ctheoretically suggested\u201d cut-off point. The clustering is \nbased on a monthly wage variable, which is selected as the most important determinant variable \nof working hours. The study uses the labor force survey data of Indonesia in 2003 (Sakernas 2003; \nsee BPS 2003).\nThe grouping result of underemployed and fully employed workers using the cluster method is \ncompared with the results of grouping using cut-off points of the International Labour Organisation \n(ILO) and the Central Board of Statistics (BPS). The comparison is conducted by employing a statistical \ntest of cross tabulations based on relevant variables. Furthermore, determinant function analysis and \neconometric method are used to further highlight why the results of using the cluster method is \nsuperior to both ILO and BPS approaches. A more comprehensive way of classifying underemployment \nusing the regression method on the determinant variables is also explored in this study.\nII. DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT\nA. De\ufb01ning Underemployment\nUnderemployment is a situation wherein a worker is employed but not in the desired capacity, \ni.e., in terms of compensation, hours, skill level, and experience. Hence, employment is inadequate \nin relation to a specified norm or alternative employment. There are two principal forms of \nunderemployment: visible and invisible underemployment. Visible underemployment is a statistical \nconcept re\ufb02ecting insuf\ufb01ciency in the number of employed. The indicator of visible underemployment \ncan be developed using results of labor force surveys and other surveys. Invisible underemployment, \non the other hand, is primarily an analytical concept re\ufb02ecting a misallocation of labor resources, \nevidenced by a worker\u2019s low income and productivity and underutilization of skill.\nFrom a slightly different view, underemployment can take four forms: working less than full \ntime, having higher skills than needed by the job, overstaf\ufb01ng, and having raw labor with few \ncomplimentary inputs (ADB 2005). Along this line, Hauser (1974 and 1977) developed a labor \nutilization framework to better measure underemployment that includes six underemployment \ncomponents (see Box 4). \nFrom a theoretical perspective, the standard theory of labor supply suggests that individuals \nwill choose their optimal number of hours, and that employment opportunities are likely to be \ndistributed across the working hours. This suggests that underemployment is not a persistent \nissue. Empirical evidence, however, suggests otherwise, as due to various reasons, there are some \nrigidities in the number of working hours that workers would like to work. Accordingly, time-related \nunderemployment has become an important issue. \nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 5", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nBOX 4\nLABOR UTILIZATION FRAMEWORK\nThe labor utilization framework (LUF) of Hauser (1974 and 1977) seeks to address the underemployment \nissue and has six components, namely: \n(i) Sub-unemployed (S). This is the discouraged workers or job seekers category, and represents the \nmost serious type of underemployment. Included in this category are those who are not working \nand not looking for jobs for the main reason of \u201cunable to \ufb01nd a job\u201d or \u201cdiscouraged.\u201d (In the new \nILO de\ufb01nition of unemployment, these discouraged job seekers are included in the new de\ufb01nition \nof unemployed. See Sugiyarto et al. 2006 for a discussion on this as well as on its impact on the \nunemployment indicator in Indonesia.)\n(ii) Unemployed (U). This represents the unemployed calculated using the standard labor force approach, \nand covers  those who are not working and are looking for work.\n(iii) Low-hour workers (H). This includes workers who are involuntary working part-time or who work \nless than the normal working hours.\n(iv) Low-income workers (I). This includes workers whose work-related income is less than the minimum \nsocial requirement, i.e., less than 1.25 times the poverty line for an individual. \n(v) Mismatched workers (M). Mismatched workers can be a result of being overeducated compared to \nwhat is typically required in relevant occupations, i.e., years of schooling is more than one standard \ndeviation above the mean schooling years required for relevant occupations.\n(vi) Adequately employed (A).This is a residual measure indicating those not belonging to any of the \nabove\ufb01ve categories. \nAll the six LUF components are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, so that any individual in the \nlabor force can only be classi\ufb01ed into one and only one type of classi\ufb01cation. The \ufb01rst component of sub-\nemployment has sometimes been excluded from the labor force and therefore from the LUF. A comparison \nof LFF and LUF is summarized in Box Table 1.\nBOX TABLE 1\nA COMPARISON OF STANDARD LABOR FORCE AND LABOR UTILIZATION FRAMEWORKS\nSTANDARDLABORFORCE LABORUTILIZATION\nFRAMEWORK FRAMEWORK\nTotal labor force Total workforce\nEmployed Utilized adequately\nUtilized inadequately by:\n\u2014Hours of work\n\u2014Income level\n\u2014Mismatch of occupation and education\nUnemployed Unemployment\nSource: Adapted from Hauser (1974).\n6 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONII\nDEFINITIONAND MEASUREMENTOFUNDEREMPLOYMENT\nB. Measuring Underemployment\n1. Conceptual Issues\nFor operational reasons, the statistical measurement of underemployment is commonly limited \nto visible underemployment. This can be measured by calculating the number of underemployed and \nthe quantum of underemployment. The underemployment indicator can be represented as a ratio of \nthe number of underemployed to the number of workers or the total labor force. The latter becomes \nthe underemployment rate. The quantum of underemployment, on the other hand, can be measured \nby aggregating the time available for additional employment of the underemployed workers.\nThe resolution concerning the measurement of underemployment and inadequate employment \nsituations, adopted by the 16th International Conference of Labor Statisticians in October \n1998,  further recommended that measurements of underemployment be limited to time-related \nunderemployment, which is de\ufb01ned as all persons in employment who satisfy the following three \ncriteria of (i) working less than a threshold relating to working time, (ii) willing to work additional \nhours, and (iii) available to work additional hours.  In this context, the underemployed comprise \nall workers who are involuntarily working less than the normal duration of work determined for the \nactivity, and seeking or available for additional work. The normal duration of work for an activity \n(normal hours) should be determined in the light of national circumstances as re\ufb02ected in national \nlegislation to the extent it is applicable; in terms of usual practices in other cases; or in terms of \na uniform conventional norm. \nThe normal hours are the hours worked before overtime payments are required. The normal \nhours can function as a ceiling on hours worked to deter excessive hours of work, or as a medium \nto obtain higher wages.\nMost labor laws mandate statutory limits on working hours. The initial working hour standard \nadopted by the ILO4 mandates a maximum of normal working hours of 48 hours per week. The more \nrecent approach at the international level5 is the promotion of 40 hours per week as a standard \nto be realized, progressively if necessary, by ILO member states (McCann 2005). The ILO research \nreveals that 40 hours per week is now the most prevalent weekly hour standard. Almost half of 103 \ncountries reviewed in the ILO report have adopted 40 hours per week or less (ILO 2005). \nThe working hour limit is initially intended to ensure a safe and healthy working environment \nand adequate rest times. The limit has also become a way of advancing additional goals of allowing \nworkers to balance their paid work with their family responsibility and other aspects of their lives, \npromoting productivity and reducing unemployment. \nFigure 1 shows the ILO strict framework for measuring underemployment, complete with the \nthree underemployment criteria. Examining the framework, there might be some conceptual problems \nin measuring underemployment. First, the question of \u201clooking to work for more hours\u201d might be \ninterpreted as only looking for more working hours from the existing jobs, excluding looking for \nadditional or even a completely new job. Second, there is no strict guideline on what availability \nmeans. As in the \ufb01rst point, availability can refer to available for more working hours only, or \n4 The hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919, No 1; and the hours of work (Commerce and Of\ufb01ces) convention, 1930, \nNo. 30.\n5 Re\ufb02ected in the Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935, No 47; and the reduction of hours of work recommendation, 1962, \nNo. 116.\nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 7", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\navailable for additional or new jobs. Third, the reference period for availability can refer to the \nsurvey\u2019s reference period or to the near future such as the next week or month. Most labor force \nsurveys refer availability to work during the surveys\u2019 reference period, while the practice in the \nUnited Kingdom and other European countries (see, for example, Simic 2002) shows that availability \nin fact refers to period after the survey. The different reference periods will of course produce \ndifferent results of underemployment.\nFIGURE 1\nTHE ILO LABOR FORCE FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT\nLabor force framework\n(economically active population\n aged 15 to 65 years)\nEmployed Not employed\nPart-time Full-time (equal or \nWorking hours\n(less than threshold) more than threshold) Full-time Part-time\nWanting to work \nLooking to work Not looking to work\nmore hours Looking Not looking\nfor more  hours for more hours\nfor job for job\nAvailable Not available Available Not available\nAvailability to work for  to work for to work for  to work for Full-time Part-time\nadditional hours additional hours additional hours additional hours\nUnderemployed\nSource: Adapted from Hussmanns et al. (1990).\nThe ambiguity of the guideline at the conceptual level can have signi\ufb01cant impacts on the \nunderemployment indicators. Worse still, various countries interpret the guideline differently in \nimplementing the LFF, including on aspects that might be considered very obvious. \nFigures 2 and 3 show how the ILO guideline can strictly be implemented in Indonesia and the \nPhilippines. Given the existing labor force surveys in the two countries, their underemployment \nindicators will not be strictly comparable even at the conceptual levels. Moreover, both indicators \nare also inconsistent with the ILO framework. \nThe Indonesian and Philippine frameworks have their own issues that make them strictly \nincomparable. Among the three criteria used for classifying underemployed, only the number of \nworking hours is relatively comparable. The other two criteria of availability and willingness to work \nmore have been interpreted differently in the two countries, making their indicators inconsistent. \nThis case is not unique for Indonesia and the Philippines; it also creates dif\ufb01culty in deriving a \nconsistent underemployment indicator across other countries. A close examination of the existing \nlabor force surveys in the developing countries reveals that a strict implementation of the ILO \nde\ufb01nition on underemployment based on the LFF would be very dif\ufb01cult. In fact in some cases, \nstrict implementation is even impossible without imposing very strong assumptions about working \nhours, wanting to work more hours, and availability for additional jobs.\n8 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONII\nDEFINITIONAND MEASUREMENTOFUNDEREMPLOYMENT\nFIGURE 2\nINDONESIAN FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT\nLabor force framework\n(economically active population\n aged 15 to 65 years)\nEmployed Not employed\nPart-time Full-time (threshold\nWorking hours\n(less than threshold) and above)\nWanting to work \nmore Looking for job Not looking for job Looking Not looking\nfor job for job\nAcceptance Accepting new job \noffered Not accepting Full-time Part-time\nUnderemployed\nSource: Adapted from the Indonesian Labor Force Survey (SAKERNAS 2003; see BPS 2003).\nFIGURE 3\nPHILIPPINE FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING UNDEREMPLOYMENT\nLabor force framework\n(economically active population\n aged 15 to 65 years)\nEmployed Not employed\nWorking hours Part-time Full-time (equal or  Want Do not want\n(less than threshold) more than threshold) to work to work\nWanting to work \nLooking to job/\nmore hours Not looking Looking Not looking\nadditional hours\nfor work for work\nAvailable Available\nAvailability to work for  Not available to work for  Not available Available Not available\nadditional hours additional hours to start to start\nUnderemployed Excluded from\nUnderemployed\nlabor force\nSource: Adapted from the Labor Force SurveyManual (NSO 2007).\nIn the Indonesian framework, for instance, the criteria of \u201cwanting\u201d and \u201cavailable\u201d to work \nmore are not explicitly accommodated in the questionnaire.

The \nmeasurement of open unemployment in the Philippines, which is also presented in Figure 3, provides \nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92  9", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\na good example on this issue as those who are not working and looking for jobs are not automatically \nclassi\ufb01ed as unemployed like in most other countries. Instead, they must also be \u201cavailable to work\u201d \nat the same time to be classi\ufb01ed as unemployed.

They could be unemployed looking for a job but still waiting \nfor something else such as receiving a quali\ufb01cation certi\ufb01cate, graduation, and so on, hence they \ncannot start working immediately. A quick cross tabulation of the Philippine labor force survey in \n2005 results in about 0.3 million people in this category.\nTwo more problems can still be identi\ufb01ed from the Indonesian framework that can systematically \nunderstate its underemployment indicators. First, the question of \u201clooking for a job\u201d among workers \ncan be interpreted as looking for a new job only, excluding looking for more working hours from \nthe existing job. Second, as there is no question on availability to work more, the question on \nwillingness to accept a new job offer can be used as a proxy. Unfortunately, this question is only \nfor those who are not looking for a job. Therefore, it cannot be used.\nThe Philippine framework follows closely the ILO guidelines. In fact, it goes a step further \nby combining both looking for a job and more working hours into one question. Therefore, those \nlooking for a new job, an additional job, and more working hours are included already in the \nunderemployed. The question on availability to work is, however, referred to as the last two weeks \nprior to the survey date.\n2. Practical Problems\nIn practice, the complete recommendation on how to measure underemployment is rarely \nused. The last two underemployment criteria of \u201clooking\u201d and \u201cavailable\u201d to work are hardly ever \nused. As a result, most underemployment indicators are calculated based only on working less \nthan a threshold related to working time, i.e., working hours below the cut-off point for a fully \nemployed worker. Moreover, the practice of determining the cut-off point in many countries is \nmostly inconsistent with the guideline that the cut-off point should be determined by considering \nnational circumstances, usual practices, or a uniform conventional norm. In reality, the cut-off point \nis determined in a less methodical way or even somewhat arbitrarily with no explanation on how \nand why the cut-off point is chosen.\nTherefore, most underemployment indicators are calculated based only on working less than \na threshold related to working time, i.e., below the cut-off point for a fully employed worker. \nAccordingly, the number of underemployed can be calculated by:\nc\nUE(cid:29)(cid:164)(WK)\nh\nh(cid:29)1 (1)\nwhere UE is underemployed, WK is the number of workers, and h is the number of working hours, \nwhich are calculated from 1 to the cut-off point (c) hour. All workers with zero working hours are \nexcluded from the calculation.\nSince there is no universal de\ufb01nition on the minimum number of hours in a week that would \nconstitute full-time work, ILO has attempted to use a 30-hour per week cut-off point in as many \n10 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONIII\nMETHODOLOGYANDDATAUSED\ncountries as possible in its Part Time Worker indicator. Unfortunately, there is also no clear explanation \non why 30 hours per week was chosen (see the ILO Manual on Key Indicators of the Labor Market,\nin which underemployment is number 5 in the total 20 indicators).6\nThe actual cut-off points used across countries vary, ranging from 25 to 40 hours per week \nwith 5-hour intervals as the most common one. In Indonesia, for instance, BPS uses 35 hours per \nweek as the cut-off point for full-time workers but there is also no explanation why the 35-hour \nworkweek was chosen. The number could have been taken from the previously required weekly \nworking hours for government employees. \nThis paper argues that the cut-off points used by both ILO and BPS of 30 and 35 hours per \nweek might be too low, especially for developing countries with the unique characteristics of their \nworkers and the nature of work they are involved in. Moreover, the cut-off point should theoretically \nbe determined in such a way that it can signi\ufb01cantly differentiate the two groups of underemployed \nand fully employed with regard to some important characteristics relevant to both groups. \nIII. METHODOLOGY AND DATA USED\nA. Determining the Cut-off Point Using Cluster Analysis\nCluster analysis is employed to determine the cut-off point of working hours, which is then \nused as the base for grouping workers into fully employed and underemployed. In doing so, the \nclustering method groups the workers into two signi\ufb01cantly different groups, and based on the \nactual average working hours of each group, the cut-off point that differentiates the two groups \nis determined. This procedure is completely different from the common practice of calculating \nunderemployment by using a cut-off point such as 30 hours (ILO) or 35 hours (BPS) per week, and \nthen calculating the number of underemployed workers based on the cut-off point used. \nThe cluster analysis encompasses a number of different algorithms and methods for grouping \nsimilar objects into respective categories. It is an exploratory data analysis to sort different objects \ninto groups in a way that the degree of association between two objects is maximal if they belong \nto the same group and minimal for otherwise. This technique has been applied to a wide variety of \nresearch problems. Hartigan (1975) provides an excellent summary of the many published studies \nreporting the results of cluster analyses. The method is useful to answer a general question on how \nto organize observed data into meaningful structures, i.e., to develop taxonomies. In general, cluster \nanalysis is very useful in classifying piles of information into manageable, meaningful groups.\nThe objects of groupings may be cases or variables. Cluster analysis is a good technique of \nexploratory data analysis when the data set is not homogeneous (or heterogeneous) with respect \nto the cases or variables concerned. A cluster analysis of cases resembles a discriminant analysis, \ni.e., classifying a set of objects into groups or categories in which neither the number nor the \nmembers of the groups are known. On the other hand, a cluster analysis of variables is similar to \nfactor analysis because both procedures identify related groups of variables.7\n6 Altogether, the ILO Manual on Key Indicators of the Labor Market consists of seven major dimensions of a labor market, \nincluding indicators on labor force, employment, unemployment and underemployment, educational attainment, wages \nand compensation costs, labor productivity and labor costs, poverty and income distribution (ILO 2007).\n7 However, factor analysis has an underlying theoretical model, while cluster analysis is more ad hoc.\nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 11", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nThere are two methods for clustering objects into categories: the hierarchical cluster analysis \nand the K-means cluster analysis. The former clusters either cases or variables, while the latter \nclusters cases only. In hierarchical clustering, clustering begins by \ufb01nding the closest pair of objects \n(cases or variables) based on a measurement for distance, then combining them to form a cluster. \nThe algorithm continues one step at a time, joining pairs of objects, pairs of clusters, or an object \nwith a cluster, until all the data are in one cluster. The clustering steps in this approach can be \ndisplayed in a tree plot or dendrogram. This method is hierarchical because once two objects or \nclusters are joined, they remain together until the \ufb01nal step. Therefore, a cluster formed in a later \nstage contains clusters from an earlier stage, which contains clusters from a still earlier stage.\nK-means cluster analysis, on the other hand, starts clustering by using the values of the \ufb01rst \nk cases in the data \ufb01le as temporary estimates of the cluster means, where k is the number of \nclusters speci\ufb01ed.8 Initial cluster centers are formed by assigning each case to the cluster with \nthe closest center and then updating the center. An iterative process is then used to \ufb01nd the \ufb01nal \ncluster centers. At each step, cases are grouped into the cluster with the closest center, and the \ncluster centers are recomputed. This process continues until no further changes occur in the centers \nor until the maximum number of iterations is reached. We can also specify cluster centers and the \ncases will be automatically allocated to the selected centers. This will allow clustering new cases \nbased on earlier results. The k-means cluster analysis procedure is especially useful for a large \nnumber of cases (i.e., more than 200 cases). The k-means method will produce exactly k different \nclusters of greatest possible distinction.\nComputationally, clustering technique can also be thought as an analysis of variance (ANOVA) \nbut in reverse order. The clustering starts with k random clusters, and then moving objects between \nthose clusters with the goal to (i) minimize variability within clusters and (ii) maximize variability \nbetween clusters. In other words, the similarity rules will apply maximally to the members of one \ncluster and minimally to members belonging to the rest of the clusters.9\nB. Assessing Clustering Results Using ANOVA Tests\nThe robustness of clustering results is then examined by assessing the resulting groups\u2019 \ndifferences with regard to independent and relevant variables that can be attributed to both \nunderemployed and fully employed groups. More speci\ufb01cally, this means that the results of grouping \nthe workers into two groups of fully employed and underemployed workers by using the ILO, BPS, \nand proposed cut-off points are assessed by comparing each group with regard to the particular \nvariables concerned. There are 10 variables used in the assessment that consist of general and work-\nrelated variables. The general variables are sociodemographic variables such as gender, urbanity, \nage group, and education attainment, while the work-related variables are something to do with \nthe workers\u2019 economic activities such as looking for a job, types of job looked for, main reason for \n8 The k-means algorithm was popularized and re\ufb01ned by Hartigan (1975). The basic operation of that algorithm is that \ngiven a \ufb01xed number of (desired or hypothesized) k clusters, observations are assigned to those clusters so that the \nmeans across clusters (for all variables) are as different from each other as possible (see also Hartigan and Wong \n1978). \n9 This is analogous to \u201cANOVA in reverse\u201d in the sense that the signi\ufb01cance test in ANOVA evaluates between-group \nvariability against within-group variability when computing the signi\ufb01cance test for the hypothesis that the means \nin the groups are different from each other. In k-means clustering, the program tries to move objects (e.g., cases) in \nand out of groups (clusters) to get the most signi\ufb01cant ANOVA results.\n12 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONIV\nMAINRESULTS\nlooking for a job, main reason for not looking for a job, willingness to accept a new job offered, \nhaving an additional job, and formality of the job. \nThe result assessment is essentially a one-way ANOVA, i.e., to examine whether or not the two \ngroups are statistically different from each other with respect to the mean of the particular variables \nselected. The initial hypothesis (Ho) of this kind of testing is that there is no difference between \nthe two groups\u2019 means with regard to the variables concerned, against the alternative hypothesis \n(Ha), that the means are signi\ufb01cantly different. The main purpose of the study is to ensure that \nthe two groups are statistically different.\nIt then follows that a higher value of observed statistics of F and (cid:70)2(chi-squared) is better \nsince it indicates a better chance to reject the initial hypothesis. In this context, one can also \nobserve the p-value of the test that shows the observed signi\ufb01cance level. As a rule of thumb, a \nprobability value of less then 5% shows that the groupings are justi\ufb01able for they are statistically \ndifferent at 95% con\ufb01dence interval. Furthermore, in the case where different cut-off points used \nfor calculating the underemployed and fully employed workers can differentiate the two groups \nvery well, which is also re\ufb02ected in the low p-value, the observed values of (cid:70)2(cid:3)and F-statistics are \nused as the basis to determine which cut-off point is the best one. Since it is basically a one-sided \nstatistical test, it then follows that the higher the observed values of (cid:70)2 and F-statistics, the better \nthe cut-off point in differentiating the characteristic of the two groups, i.e., fully employed and \nunderemployed. Therefore, the values of (cid:70)2 and F-statistics are used as the based for determining \nthe best cut-off point.\nC. Data Used \nThe data used in this study are mainly from the Indonesian Labor Force Survey, known in \nthe Indonesian language as SAKERNAS (Survey Angkatan Kerja Nasional), revised version for 2003. \nSAKERNAS has been conducted in Indonesia by BPS since 1976. The number of households covered \nin the survey annually varies from 50,000\u201395,000  households. The main variables collected in \nthe survey include gender, relation to head of household, educational attainment, main activity \nstatus during previous week, working at least one hour, temporarily not working, work experience, \nnumber of work day and work hours of all jobs, occupation of the main job, industrial classi\ufb01cation \nof the main job, employment status of the main job, hours of work in the main job, workdays of \nthe main job, average wages/salaries, seeking work, availability for work, kinds of action taken \nin seeking work, length of time in seeking work, type of job sought (part-time or full-time), and \nhaving additional jobs.10\nIV. MAIN RESULTS\nA. Average Working Hours\nThe descriptive statistics of working hours calculated from SAKERNAS 2003 show that the \naverage working hours of workers in Indonesia was relatively high, at 39 hours per week, with a \nstandard deviation of 14 hours. The working hours of workers in urban areas are longer and more \n10For more information about the survey including some of its main results, see the BPS website at http://www.bps.\ngo.id/sector/employ/index.html.\nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 13", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nvaried. Statistics in Table 1 show that the working hour is not normally distributed, as can be seen \nfrom the higher value of the kurtosis. In fact, the distribution of working hours is skewed to the \nright as can be seen from the positive value of the skewness indicator. This means that there are \nrelatively more workers working below the average working hours than otherwise.\nTABLE 1\nSUMMARY STATISTICS OF WORKING HOURS\nWORKING HOURS PER WEEK URBAN RURAL TOTAL\nAverage 44 37 39\nStandard deviation 14.5 13.7 14.4\nSkewness 0.2 0.3 0.3\nKurtosis 3.8 3.3 3.5\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS2003(BPS 2003).\nCompared to other countries in Asia, the average working hour of workers in Indonesia is \nnot the highest. An ILO study provides clear evidence that workers in Asia mostly work more \nhours than their counterparts in the other parts of the world (ILO 2005). In general, workers in \ndeveloping countries usually work more hours due to various reasons such as the still important role \nof agriculture and informal sectors in the economy. The relatively high number of average working \nhours in developing countries can also be attributed to the signi\ufb01cant number of low-paying jobs \nthat make workers work much longer hours to meet their needs. This raises an issue of multiple \njob holders, which is also prevalent in developing countries.\nFigure 4 shows the weekly average working hours of workers in 10 selected countries on which \ndata is available. The \ufb01gure clearly shows that Asian workers mostly work for longer hours than \nworkers in the Netherlands and Australia. The average working hours in the selected Asian countries \nincluded in the data set range from 39 (in Indonesia) to 47 (in India) hours per week, while the \nworking hour averages in the Netherlands and Australia are about the same at 35 hours per week. \nThe graph also shows that the average working hours in all 10 selected countries are already more \nthan 30 hours per week. Accordingly, the ILO 30-hour per week cut-off point for underemployment \nis signi\ufb01cantly below the averages. This fact further strengthens the argument in this paper that \nthe ILO cut-off point is too low to measure underemployment.\nThe evidence that workers in Asia mostly work for long hours can also be seen in the percentage \nof workers working for more than 50 hours per week. Figure 5 shows the percentage of employees \nworking for more than 50 hours per week in 13 selected countries.  As can be seen from the \ufb01gure, \nthese workers with long working hours constitute about 15% of workers in Indonesia and 43% of \nworkers in Cambodia. \n14 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONIV\nMAINRESULTS\nFIGURE 4\nAVERAGE WORKING HOURS PER WEEK, 1995\u20132003\n50.0\n46.3 46.5 46.8\n44.9\n45.0 41.2 41.5 42.5\n39.3\n40.0\n34.5 35.4\ns 35.0\nur\nho 30.0\ng \nkin 25.0\nWor 20.0\n15.0\n10.0\n5.0\n0.0\nNetherlands Australia IndonesiaPhilippinesBangladesh Japan Viet Nam Thailand Singapore India\nSource: Calculated from Labor and Social Trends in Asia and the Pacific (ILO 2005).\nFIGURE 5\nPERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYED WORKING 50 HOURS OR MORE A WEEK\n50.0\n45.0 43.0 42.8\n39.6\n40.0 38.1 36.5 36.1\nhours 3350..00 31.7 29.3 27.4\nking  25.0 23.8 22.2\nWor 20.0 18.1\n15.4\n15.0\n10.0\n5.0\n0.0\nCambodia Pakistan Thailand Korea, SingaporeMongoliaBangladesh Japan Sri LankaViet NamPhilippinesAustraliaIndonesia\nRep. of\nNote: For the latest year available.\nSource: Labor and Social Trends in Asia and the Pacific (ILO 2005).\nMoreover, there are also some workers excessively working for very long hours. Sugiyarto et \nal. (2006) show that about 8 million workers in Indonesia actually work for more than 60 hours \nper week. Figure 6 clearly indicates that during 1990\u20132003, there were about 6\u20139 million workers \nin this category. This case, unfortunately, is not unique to Indonesia for many of those working for \nmore than 50 hours per week in other selected countries depicted in Figure 5 are actually working \nfor more than 60 hours per week. \nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 15", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nFIGURE 6\nNUMBER OF WORKERS IN INDONESIA BY THEIR WORKING HOURS\n100\n9 9 9 9 9 8\n80 8 9\n7 7 7 6 8\n31 32 35 37 37 37\nns 60 27 28 27 25 29 31 33\no\nMilli 40 12 12 12 13 13 3413 14 14 14 15 15\n11 12\n20\n28 27 30 34 31 32 31 3434 34 32 30 31 31\n0\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\n<35 hours 35\u221240 hours 41\u221259 hours 60+ hours\nSource: Sugiyarto et al.

The main purpose was to determine \nwhich variable should be used as the base for the clustering analysis. The results reveal that total \nwage is the most signi\ufb01cant determinant variable of the number of hours worked by the employed \ngroup. Therefore, the total wage variable is used as the basis for clustering the workers. Furthermore, \nas was discussed in the methodology section, the K-means clustering analysis is used to group the \nworkers into two statistically different categories. Based on the grouping results, the average working \nhours in each group is calculated and the cut-off point for working full time can be determined.\nThe k-clustering results produce two groups of workers. The \ufb01rst group has an average working \nhour of around 44 hours per week while the second group has an average working hour of about \n37 hours per week. Taking these two averages into account, the cut-off point for underemployment \nis therefore 40 hours per week. Table 2 summarizes this result.\nTABLE 2\nAVERAGE WORKING HOURS OF EACH GROUP AND THE CUT-OFF POINT FOR UNDEREMPLOYMENT\nGROUP 1 GROUP 2 CUT-OFF POINT\nWorking hours per week 44 37 40\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using the K-means clustering method on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\nNotice that the resulting cut-off point from the clustering analysis is signi\ufb01cantly higher than \nthe ILO and BPS cut-off points of 30 and 35 hours per week. The cut-off point is also slightly \nhigher than the average working hour for all Indonesian workers, which is 39 hours per week. For \ndiscussion purposes, the new cut-off point of 40 hours per week henceforth is named as the ADB \ncut-off point.\n16 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONIV\nMAINRESULTS\nFIGURE 7\nAVERAGE WORKING HOUR AND CUT-OFF POINT FOR UNDEREMPLOYMENT IN\nDISTRIBUTION OF WORKERS BY NUMBER OF WORKING HOURS\n5\n4\n0)\n0 3\n0\ny (\u2019\nnsit\ne 2\nD\n1\n0\nWorking hours\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\nFigure 7 shows the number of workers for different working hours per week with the overlying \nnormal graph. The graph con\ufb01rms the summary statistics presented in Table 1 that the distribution \nof workers according to their working hours is not normal but skewed to the right11 (i.e., positive \nskewness) as there are relatively more workers working less than the average working hours than \notherwise. The \ufb01gure also shows that there are some outliers on number of workers for certain \nworking hours, which might be due to characteristics of the job such as sector, types, and status. \nThese, however, are not further explored in this paper.\nC. Measuring Underemployment\nOnce the cut-off point for working full-time is determined, underemployment can be estimated \nby calculating the number of workers who are working less than the cut-off point. Those who \nare working above the cut-off point are classi\ufb01ed as fully employed workers. For developing the \nunderemployment indicators, the number of underemployed is divided by the number of total workers \nto represent the underemployment share or, alternatively, by the number of the total labor force \nto represent the underemployment rate.\n11This is a statistical term meaning that the data distribution is skewed to the right of the graph, and not to the right \nhand side of the reader.\nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 17", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nApplying the ILO and BPS cut-off points on the revised SAKERNAS 2003 data results in \nunderemployment shares of 23% and 33% of the total workers, whereas according to the ADB cut-\noff point, the underemployment share should be around 48%. In terms of underemployment rates, \ntheir corresponding rates based on the three cut-off points would be 15%, 21%, and 31% of the \ntotal labor force, respectively. Figure 8 compares these results, which show that the ADB cut-off \npoint produces the highest underemployment share and underemployment rate. \nFIGURE 8\nUNDEREMPLOYMENT SHARES AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT RATES CALCULATED USING ILO,\nBPS, AND ADB CUT-OFF POINTS\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nILO BPS ADB\nShares to total workers Shares to total labor force\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\nAs can be seen from the results, the difference in the underemployment shares and \nunderemployment rates using the three cut-off points is really signi\ufb01cant and cannot just be ignored. \nIn term of underemployment share, the difference between the ILO and ADB results is more than 25 \npercentage points, while the difference between the BPS and ADB results is about 15 percentage \npoints. In term of rates, their differences would be 16 percentage points between the ILO and ADB \nresults, and 10 percentage points between the BPS and ADB results. \nTo put these in perspective, one percentage point in the workforce equals 0.93 million workers \nwhile one percentage point in the labor force constitutes about 1.03 million of the labor force. \nThe total number of workers and labor force based on SAKERNAS 2003 are about 92.8 million \nworkers and 102.6 million of the labor force, respectively (ADB 2006). Therefore, the difference \nbetween the ILO and ADB results will be about 23.2 million workers, a staggering number even by \nIndonesian standards. By ILO de\ufb01nitions, these workers will be classi\ufb01ed as fully employed, while \nthe ADB measure classi\ufb01es them as underemployed. The estimated number of underemployed by \nILO standard is 21.3 million workers, while according to the ADB cut-off point the number would \nbe 44.5 million12 workers.\nNotice that the consequences of changes in the cut-off points from 30 to 35 and then from 35 \nto 40 hours per week on the underemployment \ufb01gures have become more considerable. In moving from \n12This number is slightly different with the number of workers working less than 40 hours per week in Figure 6, which is \naround 46 million workers. The main reason is because the calculation of the number of workers during 1990\u20132003 for \n2003 is based on the unrevised SAKERNAS 2003, while this study is based on the revised (latest) version of SAKERNAS\n2003.\n18 MARCH 2007", "SECTIONIV\nMAINRESULTS\n30 to 35 hours per week, a 1-hour increase in the cut-off point will increase about 2.5 percentage \npoints the underemployment share, while the same 1-hour increase in moving from 35 to 40 hours \nper week results in a higher increase of 3 percentage points in the underemployment share. In term \nof rates, the increases are from 1.6 to 2 percentage points, respectively. Therefore, a 1-hour increase \nin the cut-off point results in an increase of 3 percentage points in the underemployment share \nand 2 percentage points in the underemployment rate. Table 3 summarizes the underemployment \nand full employment shares and rates calculated using the three different cut-off points.\nSAKERNAS also collects information about worker economic activities such as looking for a \njob, having an additional job, and accepting a new job offered. Table 4 summarizes the average \nworking hours of workers with these additional economic activities. It seems that looking for a job \nfor a worker is a good indication of underutilization, especially with regard to the hours that the \nworkers would like to work and actually work. This shows that the average working hours of those \nwho are looking for a job is lower than the ones not looking for a job. The average working hour \nof workers still looking for a job is about 37.5 hours per week, lower than the average of those \nnot looking for job, which is around 39 hours per week. A similar pattern can be observed with \nworkers who have an additional job, whether or not they are looking for a job.\nFrom Table 4, one can calculate the massive scale of the underemployment volume represented \nby the number of hours needed to make all underemployed workers fully employed. The average \nworking hours of underemployed by ADB standards, i.e., those who are working less than 40 hours \nper week, is only 28 hours per week. As their share in the workforce is 48% (Figure 8), this means \nthat 48% of the existing workers need to work for at least 12 hours more per week to become fully \nemployed. Therefore, in terms of working hours, the underemployment volume in Indonesia is about \n534.5 million working hours, which is calculated by multiplying the number of underemployed with \nthe average shortfall  share  (48% x 92.8 million x 12 hours).

The overall results show that most underemployed have no additional job and they are not \nsatis\ufb01ed with their existing job. For those looking for a job, they are mostly looking for part-time \njobs, while those who are not looking for a job still accept any new job offered.

On the other \nhand, the characteristics of the fully employed workers are not different from the underemployed \nespecially with regard to the work-related variables.

Despite their \nrelatively long working hours, most of them are still not happy with their jobs, making them look \nfor other jobs.

This means that the characteristics of underemployed and fully employed \nworkers are signi\ufb01cantly different. \nMoreover, comparing the (cid:70)(cid:21) and F-statistics across different cut-off points shows that the results \nof applying the BPS cut-off point are better than those of ILO, and that the results of applying \nthe ADB cut-off point are superior to those of BPS and ILO. The summary table shows that ADB \n26 MARCH 2007", "SECTION V\nCHOWTESTANDRECURSIVEDYNAMICREGRESSIONANALYSIS\ncut-off point results perform best in the 6 out of 10 variables used in the assessment. This best \nperformance is indicated by the highest values of the (cid:70)(cid:21) and F-statistics. The only exception is on \nthe results on the variables gender, education, having an additional job, and formality of the job. \nIn the gender and having additional job variables, the ILO cut-off point performs better than ADB \nwhile in the other two variables the BPS cut-off point results are the best. \nV. CHOW TEST AND RECURSIVE DYNAMIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS\nAnother way to determine and/or assess the cut-off point is by using econometric methods. \nThis is conducted \ufb01rst by establishing the economic relationship between working hours and some \ndeterminant variables, and then conducting regression analysis for different subsamples of workers \nbased on their working hours. The main purpose is to \ufb01nd out the best cut-off point of working hours \nsuch that the workers can be best divided into two groups of fully employed and underemployed. \nIn general, the empirical model of working hours can take the form:\nWH (cid:29) f(DV,CV,D) (2)\ni i i i\nwhere WH is the working hours, DV is the determinant variable, CV is the control variable, and D is \nthe dummy variable that takes into account variations in factors excluded in the model. The dummy \nvariable can take the form of additive and multiplicative dummy variables, depending on the data \ndistribution and estimation results. For exploratory purposes and to further strengthen the case \nin \ufb01nding the best cut-off point, the regression model is estimated in both cases of bivariate and \nmultiple variable models. The results indicate that the best bivariate model is in the form of:\nWorking hours = cons + b1*wage_tot + b2*group_ue + b3*group_ue*wage_tot + e\nMeanwhile, the best multiple regression model is as follows:\nWorking hours = cons + b1*wage_tot + b2*look_job + b3*add_job + b4*urb + b5*sex + \nb6*group_ue + e\nwhere: \nwage_tot = total wages both cash and kind; look_job = looking for job dummy; add_job =\nadditional job dummy, urb = urban/rural dummy; sex = male/female dummy; and group_ue = \nunderemployed group de\ufb01ned by working less than 25\u201345 hours per week.\nBased on the best empirical model that can be developed from the data sets, two methods \nfor assessing and/or determining the cut-off point can be used. These methods are the Chow test \nand the recursive dynamic regression technique. \nA. Chow Test\nThe Chow test is commonly used to examine the parameter instability of a model across the \nwhole sample. The main question here is whether the relationship depicted in the model holds \nover the whole sample. To answer the question, the sample is divided into two groups and the \nmodel is then run on the subsamples and total sample to see if there is any change observed in \nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 27", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nthe parameter estimates. This is the underlying process of the Chow test. Formally, the hypothesis-\ntesting problem can be summarized as follows:\nConsider the linear model Y = X(cid:69)+(cid:72). As there are two sub samples, (1) and (2), in which the \nparameters are not necessarily the same, therefore:\nY = X (cid:69)+(cid:72) i (cid:143) (1) (3)\ni i 1 i\nY = X (cid:69)+(cid:72) i (cid:143) (2) (4)\ni i 2 i\nThe hypothesis-testing in this context is Ho : (cid:69) = (cid:69) , and the total number of observations \n1 2\nis n = n1 +n2.\nThe Chow test is actually an application of the F-test, since the regression\u2019s sum squared \nerrors (RSS) from the three regressions for each subsample and for the total sample follow the F\ndistribution. Under H\no    \n(RSS(cid:13)RSS (cid:13)RSS )/K\nJ 2 (cid:157)F (5)\n(RSS (cid:11)RSS )/(n (cid:11)n (cid:13)2k) k,n (cid:11)n (cid:13)2k\n1 2 1 2 1 2\nThe application of the Chow test in this study is to examine if the two groups of fully employed \nand underemployed workers have different characteristics with respect to some independent \nvariables. The difference is re\ufb02ected in the parameters of the variables concerned across the \ndifferent groups. \nTherefore based on the best bivariate and multiple regressions, a series of Chow tests is \nconducted by running the models on the total sample as well as on the subsamples, which were \nformed by dividing the total sample into two groups using different cut-off points of working \nhours. Accordingly, the level of working hours that corresponds to the highest level of parameter \nchange detected by the Chow test should be used as the cut-off point for underemployment, for \nthat implies that the two groups of workers have the most statistically signi\ufb01cant difference in \nthe regression parameters.\nB. Recursive Regression Technique\nThe recursive regression technique is conducted by running a series of regressions recursively, \ni.e., starting from a certain subsample and then adding a new sample continuously. A record of \nthe regression statistics is compiled to examine if there is any signi\ufb01cant shift in the model\u2019s \nparameters. \nThe number of working hours on which the structural break is identi\ufb01ed by the Chow test \nand/or recursive regression can then be used as a proxy for the cut-off point for fully employed and \nunderemployed workers. Furthermore, assuming that the cut-off point of working hours would be in \nthe range of 25\u201345 hours per week, the Chow test and recursive regression analysis are conducted \nonly within this band of working hours. Therefore, a possibility that the cut-off point would be \nbelow 25 or above 45 hours per week is dropped in the analysis.\nC.  Test Results\nChow test results for the bivariate and multivariate models further con\ufb01rm that 40 hours \nper week is a very good cut-off point for determining underemployment and full employment. \n28 MARCH 2007", "SECTION V\nCHOWTESTANDRECURSIVEDYNAMICREGRESSIONANALYSIS\nTables 8 and 9 summarize the regression statistics conducted for the Chow tests. Figure 11 shows \nthe regression result statistics of the recursive regressions, namely the F-statistics of both the \nbivariate and multiple regression models, and the adjusted R-squared. As can be seen from the \nsummary tables, the 40 hours per week cut-off point produces the highest F-statistics in the Chow \ntest in both bivariate and multiple regressions. This means that the 40 hours per week cut-off \ncan differentiate the two groups of workers most strongly, as re\ufb02ected in the highest change \ndetected in the regression parameter. The 40 hours per week cut-off point also produces the highest\nF-statistic, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared in the regression estimates. All these indicate that \nthe model with this subsample is the most powerful one in explaining the relationship captured \nby the model. Moreover, the lowest MSE of the 40 hours per week cut-off point further indicates \nthat the regression with this subsample is also the most ef\ufb01cient. Therefore, the 40 hours per week \ncut-off point is indeed the best, compared to the cut off-points of 30 and 35 hours per week. \nThe recursive regression results of the bivariate and multivariate models also con\ufb01rm that the \n40 hours per week is the best cut-off point for determining underemployment and full employment \n(see Figure 12). \nTABLE 8\nSUMMARY CHOW TEST STATISTICS OF BIVARIATE MODEL\nWORKING HOURS F-STAT PROB>F R-SQUARED ADJ R-SQUARED ROOT MSE F-CHOW\n25 11490.99 0.00 0.49 0.49 11.19 16665.14\n26 12230.73 0.00 0.51 0.51 11.02 17756.69\n27 12668.05 0.00 0.52 0.52 10.92 18401.99\n28 13065.43 0.00 0.52 0.52 10.83 18988.35\n29 14177.32 0.00 0.54 0.54 10.60 20629.02\n30 14562.68 0.00 0.55 0.55 10.52 21197.66\n31 15817.30 0.00 0.57 0.57 10.28 23048.94\n32 16122.73 0.00 0.58 0.58 10.22 23499.62\n33 16568.63 0.00 0.58 0.58 10.14 24157.58\n34 16888.67 0.00 0.59 0.59 10.09 24629.82\n35 17087.23 0.00 0.59 0.59 10.05 24922.82\n36 17455.76 0.00 0.59 0.59 9.99 25466.61\n37 17961.59 0.00 0.60 0.60 9.90 26213.00\n38 18082.93 0.00 0.60 0.60 9.88 26392.04\n39 18108.34 0.00 0.60 0.60 9.88 26429.54\n40 18051.49 0.00 0.60 0.60 9.89 26345.65\n41 17722.20 0.00 0.60 0.60 9.94 25859.76\n42 17496.29 0.00 0.60 0.60 9.98 25526.41\n43 16212.68 0.00 0.58 0.58 10.21 23632.35\n44 16043.66 0.00 0.57 0.57 10.24 23382.95\n45 15673.65 0.00 0.57 0.57 10.31 22836.97\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation from SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92 29", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nTABLE 9\nSUMMARY CHOW TEST STATISTICS OF MULTIVARIATE MODEL\nWORKING HOURS F-STAT PROB>F R-SQUARED ADJ R-SQUARED ROOT MSE F-CHOW\n25 3505.93 0.00 0.52 0.52 10.88 4868.12\n26 3687.18 0.00 0.53 0.53 10.74 5158.55\n27 3794.58 0.00 0.54 0.54 10.65 5330.64\n28 3904.08 0.00 0.55 0.55 10.57 5506.10\n29 4185.80 0.00 0.56 0.56 10.37 5957.51\n30 4279.92 0.00 0.57 0.57 10.30 6108.31\n31 4572.15 0.00 0.58 0.58 10.11 6576.56\n32 4653.33 0.00 0.59 0.59 10.06 6706.64\n33 4760.52 0.00 0.59 0.59 9.99 6878.39\n34 4847.33 0.00 0.60 0.60 9.94 7017.48\n35 4924.52 0.00 0.60 0.60 9.89 7141.18\n36 5018.43 0.00 0.61 0.61 9.83 7291.65\n37 5139.26 0.00 0.61 0.61 9.76 7485.25\n38 5174.27 0.00 0.61 0.61 9.74 7541.36\n39 5187.66 0.00 0.62 0.62 9.73 7562.80\n40 5191.73 0.00 0.62 0.62 9.73 7569.33\n41 5116.39 0.00 0.61 0.61 9.77 7448.62\n42 5069.72 0.00 0.61 0.61 9.80 7373.83\n43 4743.04 0.00 0.59 0.59 10.00 6850.39\n44 4706.12 0.00 0.59 0.59 10.02 6791.22\n45 4609.61 0.00 0.59 0.59 10.09 6636.58\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation from SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n30 MARCH 2007", "SECTION V\nCHOWTESTANDRECURSIVEDYNAMICREGRESSIONANALYSIS\nFIGURE 11\nCHOW TEST RESULTS OF BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION MODELS\n8,000\n26,000\n24,000\nmodel 7,000 model\nultiple regression  2202,,000000 variate regression \nm 6,000 bi\nof  of \ns  s \ne e\nu u\nal 18,000 al\nv v\nF- F-\n5,000\n16,000\n25 30 35 40 45\nWorking hours\nMultiple regression Bivariate model\nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92  31", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nFIGURE 12\nRECURSIVE REGRESSION RESULTS OF BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE MODELS\nF-statistics\n6.0 6.0\nel el\nd d\no o\nm m\no  5.0 5.0 o \nn n\nsi si\ns s\ne e\ngr gr\ne re 4.0 4.0 e re\npl at\nmulative change of multi 321...000 321...000 mulative change of bivari\nCu Cu\n0.0 0.0\n25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44\nWorking hours\nMultiple regression model Bivariate regression model\nAdjusted R2\n5.0 5.0\nel el\nd d\no o\nm m\no  4.0 4.0 o \nn n\nsi si\ns s\ne e\ngr gr\ne e\ne r 3.0 3.0 e r\npl at\nmulative change of multi 21..00 21..00 mulative change of bivari\nCu Cu\n0.0 0.0\n25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44\nWorking hours\nMultiple regression model Bivariate regression model\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation from SAKERNAS 2003 (BPS 2003).\n32 MARCH 2007", "SECTION VI\nCONCLUSIONANDPOLICYIMPLICATION\nVI. CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATION\nUnemployment and underemployment are the most pressing problems in Asia today as re\ufb02ected \nby the widespread underutilization rate of about 29% of the total labor force. The underutilization \nrate could have been higher if a better measure were used in the calculation. The standard labor \nforce framework currently in use worldwide is biased toward counting a labor force as employed \nrather than as unemployed against the backdrop that most of the labor force in developing countries \ncannot afford to be completely unemployed. This systematically undervalues the full extent of the \nunemployment problem, which makes the introduction of underemployment indicators necessary to \ncomplement the open unemployment indicator and to better measure underutilization. \nThe current underemployment measurement, however, also has conceptual and practical \nproblems that systematically understate the underemployment level. The existing guidelines to \nmeasure time-related underemployment using the cut-off point for full-time work set the threshold \ntoo low, resulting in a considerable under representation of underemployment, which has serious \npolicy implications. \nThis study shows the consequences of the measures used and suggests a better way to \ndetermine the cut-off point and therefore measure underemployment. The cluster method is adopted \nto determine the better cut-off point and the robustness of its application results are assessed \nusing ANOVA tests. The Chow test and recursive dynamic regression are also employed to determine \nand/or assess the best cut-off point for measuring underemployment.\nThe consequence of using an incorrect cut-off point for underemployment is very signi\ufb01cant \nsince a small change in the cut-off point will result in a much bigger change in underemployment \nrate and incidence. In the Indonesian context, for instance, applying the ILO and BPS cut-off points \nof 30 and 35 hours of work per week will result in underemployment shares of 23% and 33%, \nrespectively. Meanwhile, according to the ADB cut-off point of 40 hours per week, underemployment \nshould be around 48% of the total workers. In term of underemployment rates, the numbers would \nbe 15%, 21%, and 31% of the total labor force, respectively. Underemployment shares according \nto ILO and ADB results differ by more than 25 percentage points, while between ADB and BPS the \ndifference is about 15 percentage points. In term of underemployment rates, their differences would \nbe 16 and 10 percentage points, respectively. \nOverall, a 1-hour increase in the cut-off point results in an increase of 3 percentage points \nin the underemployment share and 2 percentage points in the underemployment rate. During \n1990\u20132003, there were about 11\u201315 million workers who were working between 35 and 40 hours \nper week in Indonesia (Sugiyarto et al. 2006). They could be misclassi\ufb01ed as fully employed \nworkers according to the BPS de\ufb01nition. This misclassi\ufb01cation cannot just be ignored for it has \nserious policy implications on the effort to promote full, productive, and freely chosen employment. \nMoreover, the average working hours of the underemployed by the ADB standard in Indonesia is \nonly 28 hours per week. Considering about 48% of workers are underemployed and the number of \nworkers is about 92.8 million, the volume of underemployment in Indonesia is about 534.5 million \nworking hours. This is equivalent to 13.4 million full-time jobs that must be generated just to make \nthe underemployed fully employed.\nLearning from the Indonesian and Philippine cases, the cut-off point seems better determined \nat the individual country level to consider country-speci\ufb01c characteristics. If a comparison across \ncountries is needed, a 40 hours per week cut-off point is better than the currently used ILO standard \nERD WORKINGPAPERSERIESNO. 92  33", "MEASURINGUNDEREMPLOYMENT: ESTABLISHINGTHECUT-OFFPOINT\nGUNTURSUGIYARTO\nof 30 hours per week. The consequence of misclassifying the underemployed as fully employed is \nmore serious than otherwise. Moreover, the more recent approach at the international level is the \npromotion of a 40-hour workweek as a standard to be realized by ILO member states, and that \n40-hour workweek is now the most prevalent weekly hour standard (McCann 2005). The 40-hour \nworkweek is also in line with the Forty-Hour Week Convention 1935 No. 47, and the reduction of \nhours of work recommendation 1962 No. 116. \nREFERENCES\nADB. 2005.
