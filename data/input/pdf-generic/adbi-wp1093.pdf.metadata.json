INTRODUCTION \nGender  equality  and  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  are  essential  to  fostering \neconomic growth, promoting social development, and enhancing business performance. \nWomen\u2019s labor force participation has been advancing in most countries, hand in hand \nwith  an  increasingly  integrated  world  economy.  One  of  the  most  \nnotable features of international economic integration is foreign direct investment (FDI), \ndefined  as  a  cross-border  investment  by  a  person  (natural  or  legal)  exercising  \ncontrol or significant influence over the management of the enterprise abroad. FDI has \nreceived  considerable  attention  as  a  source  of  economic  development,  especially \nthrough technology transfer (e.g., Nabin, Nguyen, and Sgro 2013). Considering the \npotential benefits, many governments in developing and emerging economies have \nundertaken substantive efforts to become an attractive destination for FDI.  \nThe impacts of FDI on host countries\u2019 labor markets in terms of wages and other \noutcomes have been studied extensively.1 However, we still have very limited empirical \nevidence  regarding  the  impact  of  FDI  on  gender-related  outcomes.  This  paper \ncontributes to this sparse literature by studying the impact of FDI on labor market \noutcomes with a gender focus in Cambodia. Using nationally representative household \nsurvey data collected in 2004, 2009, and 2014, we investigate the relationship between \nFDI and women\u2019s labor market outcomes in terms of wages and probability of formal \nemployment. Our study focuses on paid employment in manufacturing (i.e., not self-\nemployed). We split the manufacturing sector into two groups: the garment sector, and \nother  manufacturing  sectors.  The  garment  sector  has  represented  the  backbone  \nof Cambodia\u2019s economy in recent decades and is also the major employer of Cambodian \nwomen.  \nOne of the main challenges in the literature on FDI and labor-market outcomes is the \nidentification problem, which arises from the fact that FDI is not randomly distributed \nacross industries, regions, and countries (Hale and Xu 2016). Rather, FDI tends to occur \nin places where foreign companies expect high profitability, a phenomenon termed the \n\u201ccherry-picking effect.\u201d This influences the labor market effects of FDI, as firms with \npositive prospects tend to have higher wages compared to prevailing local salaries. \nSeveral empirical studies on the impact of FDI simply use ordinary least squares (OLS) \nregressions without controlling for possible endogeneity. In order to overcome the \nidentification challenge, we employ an instrumental variables (IV) approach. We use the \nexogenous variations of inward FDI across provinces linked to spatial differences in the \nprovinces\u2019 initial industry composition in order to identify the causal effects of FDI on \nlabor market outcomes.  \nOverall, we find a statistically significant and positive relationship between FDI and key \nlabor market outcomes in terms of wages and the probability of working in the formal \nsector. Furthermore, our results reveal that FDI helps to eliminate the gender gap with \nregard to wages and, more importantly, probability of working in the formal sector in other \nmanufacturing sectors. Nevertheless, we also find that FDI does not lower the wage gap \nin the garment sector. \n \n1  Hale and Xu (2016) provide a meta-analysis demonstrating that FDI has positive effects on host countries\u2019 \nlabor markets.  \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \n1.1  Literature Review \nThere is considerable literature regarding the relationship between FDI and labor market \noutcomes.  For  instance,  Aitken,  Harrison,  and  Lipsey  (1996),  Hunya  (1997),  and \nGolejewska  (2002)  all  argue  that  foreign-owned  firms  generally  pay  higher  wages \ncompared with their domestic counterparts. This is explained by the fact that foreign-\nowned firms use more advanced technology and thus require higher levels of skills. \nHowever, we find only a few studies examining the impact of FDI on labor market \noutcomes with a gender focus. For instance, Braunstein and Brenner (2007) examine \nthe impact of FDI on the pay gap between female and male workers in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). They find that this effect is contingent on whether the FDI is \ndirected more toward male- or female-dominated industries. In the PRC, early FDI \nproved advantageous for women, but by 2002 men experienced larger wage gains from \nFDI than women due to industrial upgrading being more tilted toward male-dominated \nindustries.  \nThe literature on the impact of trade opening (measured in terms of tariff changes as \nopposed to FDI) on the gender wage gap usually finds that openness has helped women. \nFor example, Gaddis and Pieters (2012) provide evidence that tariff reductions are \nassociated  with  an  increase  in  female  labor  force  participation  and  employment  \nin  Brazil.  They  also  address  the  identification  problem  of  trade  flows  using  the \ninstrumental variable approach. Furthermore, Kis-Katos, Pieters, and Sparrow (2018) \ninvestigate the gender-specific effects of trade liberalization in Indonesia, concluding that \na  reduction  in  input  tariffs  leads  to  improved  labor  opportunities  for  women,  and \nincreases their work participation and working hours. Finally, Jamielaa and Kawabata \n(2018) study have studied the case of Indonesia, and show that trade openness helped \nto reduce the gender wage gap between 2008 and 2014. \nFinally, several empirical studies consider the impact of globalization (mostly categorized \nby trade integration) on informality, but the results are mixed. For the case of Brazil, Dix-\nCarneiro and Kovak (2017) find that regions facing larger tariff cuts have experienced \nmore prolonged declines in formal sector employment and earnings relative to other \nregions. In contrast, McCaig and Pavcnik (2018), analyzing the impact of United States \n(US) tariff reductions on labor allocation in Viet Nam, demonstrate that these decrease \nthe probability of working for a household business, resulting in a reallocation of workers \ntoward the formal sector. Moreover, Ben Yahmed and Bombarda (2018) study the impact \nof trade liberalization on formal employment across gender in Mexico, with their results \nindicating  that  tariff  cuts  increase  the  probability  of  working  in  the  formal  sector, \nespecially for men. \n1.2  Trade and FDI Trends in Cambodia \nStarting in the 1970s, Cambodia experienced nearly two decades of political upheavals, \ncivil wars, and foreign occupation, leading to a substantial loss of human capital and all \ntypes of infrastructure. In 1989, the country underwent a drastic economic reform from a \ncentrally planned economy to a market economy. The economic reform included the \nprivatization  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  integration  into  the  regional  and \nmultilateral trade architecture, and a favorable FDI regime through the establishment of \nspecial economic zones (SEZ). Cambodia became a member of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area in 1999, and subsequently became \na member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in October 2004 as the first least-\ndeveloped country.  \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \nFigure 1 displays the aggregate volume of exports by sector in Cambodia for the years \n1997 to 2015. The total volume of exports increased significantly from a total of $448 \nmillion in 1997 to $13.8 billion in 2015. In most years the garment sector generated more \nthan 90% of total exports, and it has grown impressively over the past two decades, \nstarting from $302 million to become a $11.4 billion export industry in 2015. The garment \nsector has become the backbone of the country\u2019s economy, earning billions of dollars of \nforeign exchange and employing hundreds of thousands of workers (87% of whom are \nfemale), thereby significantly contributing to economic growth and poverty alleviation.  \nFigure 1: Cambodia\u2019s Exports by Sector (1997\u20132015) \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on UN Comtrade. \nRegarding export destinations, the garment sector in Cambodia heavily relies on two \nmain export markets, namely the United States and the European Union (EU), which \ntogether account for 73% of total garment exports. Until 2011, the US was the largest \nmarket for the sector\u2019s exports, but the EU has since become more significant, as Figure \n2 shows. The surge of exports to the EU is mainly due to the EU\u2019s \u2018Everything But Arms\u2019 \n(EBA) scheme2 and its relaxation of the rules of origin3 in 2011. Given that Cambodia\u2019s \ngarment industry uses raw materials, fabrics, and other inputs that are mainly imported \nfrom the PRC, more flexible rules of origin have enabled it to qualify for preferential \nmarket access to the EU. \nTo transform and modernize Cambodia\u2019s industrial structure from a labor-intensive \nindustry  to  a  skill-based  industry  by  2025,  the  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia  \n(2015) has adopted an Industrial Development Policy 2015\u20132025. The government \nestablished the policy to mobilize and attract FDI as a vehicle of economic growth and a \nkey driver of the growth of the formal sector. Figure 3 presents a trend in inward FDI \nstock in the manufacturing sector for the periods 2001 to 2014, based on data provided \nby the Central Bank of Cambodia as well as the authors\u2019 own calculations. During the \nentire period, a substantial proportion of FDI inflows were directed toward the garment \nsector, and increased in absolute terms from $3.2 million in 2001 to $2.6 billion in 2014. \nThe garment sector was the most successful in attracting inward FDI into Cambodia, \n \n2  The EU\u2019s generalized system of preferences (GSP), which grants all products apart from arms and \nammunition from 49 of the world\u2019s least developed countries (LDCs) duty-free and quota-free access to \nthe EU market. \n3  Rules that determine the criteria by which to decide whether goods were really produced or manufactured \nin the beneficiary country to which the preferential tariff treatment is granted.  \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \nrepresenting about 70% of total FDI stock in manufacturing and 20% of total FDI stock \nincluding the service sector.  \nFigure 2: Cambodia\u2019s Garment Exports by Major Markets (1997\u20132005) \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on UN Comtrade. \nFigure 3: FDI Stock by Sector (Garment and Other Manufacturing) \n \nSource: Bank of Cambodia and authors calculations for years 2001 to 2007. \nRegarding foreign investors\u2019 countries of origin, Figure 4 indicates that Cambodia\u2019s \ngarment sector is largely owned by foreign investors, mainly from the PRC.

It should also be noted that the imports of inputs into the garment sector from \nthe PRC usually enjoy a full tariff exemption (Chheang and Hamanaka 2011). The \ngovernment has granted these favorable terms to attract additional FDI from the PRC.  \n   \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \nFigure 4: Ownership of Garment Factories  \n \nSource: Garment Manufacturers\u2019 Association of Cambodia. \n2.  DATA \n2.1  Data Sources \nThe data for the analyses are drawn from several different sources. First, the main data \nsource of our study is a nationally representative household survey collected by the \nNational  Institute  of  Statistics  (NIS)  under  the  Ministry  of  Planning  of  the  Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia, called the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES). The \nsurvey is conducted yearly, but every five years with a large sample size. We therefore \nuse the years 2004, 2009, and 2014 of large CSES data for the regression analyses. \nThese three waves of surveys each cover between 12,000 and 15,000 households, \ncorresponding to 54,000 to 75,000 individuals. The survey provides a comprehensive \nset of indicators on living conditions in Cambodia, covering the main socio-economic \nareas such as health, education, and economic activities. We consider three key labor \nmarket outcomes \u2013 (1) monthly wages; (2) hourly wages; and (3) the probability that \nindividuals work in the formal sector (defined as workers whose employment status is \neither employee or employer) \u2013 all referring to the population aged between 15 and  \n64 years old. \nThe FDI data come from the Central Bank of Cambodia. FDI inflow data by sector have \nonly been recorded by the Central Bank since 2007. Indeed, prior to 2007, only the total \nFDI inflows are known. In order to proxy the FDI inflows by sector in 2004, we assume \nthat FDI had the same average share by industry as in the period from 2007 to 2014. \nFinally, to create an instrumental variable for FDI, we use the UN Comtrade database \n(repository of official international trade statistics) to obtain the trade value (US dollars) \nby sector. \n2.2  Descriptive Analysis \nTable 2 presents the gender ratio of paid employees in the garment sector and other \nmanufacturing sectors by year. As the table shows, females account for nearly 80% of \nthe workforce in the garment sector. By contrast, women only account for about 20% in \nthe other manufacturing sectors. Over time, in the garment sector as well as in the other \nmanufacturing sectors, women have seen their shares fall, which might indicate that \nwomen are increasingly moving into service industries.  \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \nTable 2: Gender Ratio of Workers in Garment and Other Manufacturing Sectors \nGarment  Other Manufacturing \nYear  Female  Male  Female  Male \n2004  83.1%  16.9%  23.8%  76.2% \n2009  83.3%  16.7%  15.0%  85.0% \n2014  77.4%  22.6%  16.2%  83.8% \nSource: Authors calculations. \nTable 3 presents summary statistics and the results of a test of mean difference of \nseveral labor market outcomes using the CSES data in 2004, 2009, and 2014. As \nindicated in the table, women have a lower monthly income compared to men in both the \ngarment and other manufacturing sectors. However, when calculating the hourly wage, \nthe gender difference is no longer statistically insignificant.4  \nThe table also compares the likelihood of being formally employed. The likelihood of \nhaving formal employment is high in the garment sector. An overwhelming majority of \nworkers enjoy the benefit of a formal job, with men being slightly more likely than women.  \nThe reason for the high level of formality in the garment sector is the fact that this sector \nis largely owned and run by foreign investors that offer formal employment. In the other \nmanufacturing sectors, formal employment is much rarer. Only about a quarter of the \nfemale population are formally employed, in contrast to about half the male population. \nOverall, the gender disparities are more marked in the manufacturing sector than in the \ngarment sector.  \nTable 3: Summary Statistics of Labor Market Outcomes \nGarment  Other Manufacturing \nFemal p- Femal p-\n   e  Male  value  e  Male  value \nMonthly wage income (US$ purchasing  176.27  188.35  0.01  152.23  196.51  0.00 \npower parity, PPP) \nHourly wage (US$ PPP)  0.85  0.89  0.20  0.91  0.96  0.58 \nProbability of working in formal sector  0.87  0.90  0.00  0.25  0.51  0.00 \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n3.  METHODOLOGY \n3.1  Calculation of FDI by Sector and by Province \nFirst, to calculate inward FDI by sector and by province, we follow Topalova\u2019s (2010) \nmethodology and construct a region-level, time-varying measure of exposure to trade \nreforms. Namely, we calculate the provincial variation of inward FDI by sector based on \nthe employment share of each sector by province in 1997, prior to Cambodia joining the \nWTO and the expansion of FDI. In a first step, we divide the manufacturing sector into \ngarment and other manufacturing, comprising the manufacture of food (37%), wood \n \n4  Since 2013, the statutory minimum wage level in the garment sector has been rising, from $80 in 2013 to \n$100 in 2014, and $170 in 2018. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \n(36%), metal products (10%), and other (17%). Thus, we have two categories of sectors: \n(1) garment, and (2) other manufacturing.  \nIn a second step, using CSES 1997 data, we calculate the average employment share \nby each sector at the provincial level (Table A1 in the Appendix). In the third step, we \nuse the employment share as weights to allocate the total FDI amount in each year to \nthe sectoral and provincial level. Thus, the equation by which to estimate FDI in province \np in industry i in year t is as follows: \n \n\u2211\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,1997\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = \u00d7\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d,1997\n3.2  Empirical Framework \nTo measure the impact of FDI on labor market outcomes, we estimate an individual-level \nmodel on the pooled sample. The estimation equation is the following: \nYi,p,t= \u03b1 +\u03b2FDI p,t + \u03b3 (Female i,p * FDI p)+ \u03b4X i,p,t +\u03bcr + \u028ei + \u03b8t +\u03b5i,p,t   [1] \nWhere Yi,p,t is an individual-level outcome, i , in a province, p, in a given year, t: (1) log \nof hourly wage5; (2) log of monthly wage; and (3) the probability that the individual works \nin the formal sector (working age between 15 and 64 years old). The FDI is the log of \ninward  FDI  stock  by  sector  (garment  and  other  manufacturing)  and  by  province  \nin a given year t, and\u03b2is the parameter estimate of interest. Furthermore, we include the \ninteraction  term  of  the  female  dummy  and  FDI  to  verify  the  differential  impact  of  \nFDI by gender. X is a vector of individual-level control variables (gender, age, square \nroot of age, years of education, marital status, urban dummy, household size, and \nnumber of children). \u03bcis a province fixed effect that captures unobserved provincial \nheterogeneity, \u028e denotes industry fixed effects, while year-fixed effects, \u03b8, control for \nmacroeconomic factors and other trends affecting the country as a whole. Finally, \nstandard errors are clustered at the provincial level. \nThis simple estimation strategy does not control for endogeneity. Possible endogeneity \narises from the fact that FDI flows are not randomly allocated across firms, industries, \nsectors, and regions. Indeed, foreign investors seek to invest in places that they view as \nhaving high growth and profitability potential, called the \u201ccherry-picking effect.\u201d This \nphenomenon extends to the labor market effects of FDI, as firms with positive future \nprospects tend to have higher wages and grow faster relative to their peers. Thus, \nemploying a simple OLS regression model [1] causes a biased estimate, \u03b2, so we tackle \nthis identification problem by using the IV approach. This enables us to identify variation \nin the FDI measure that is not due to the firm\u2019s expected growth prospects, and to use \nthis variation of FDI to measure the impact as a fully exogenous portion.  \nTo instrument for FDI, we use the fact that good access to foreign markets is an important \nconsideration behind the foreign investment into Cambodia. Thus, we use the weighted \ndistance between provincial capitals and ports in interaction with an index of weighted \ntrade values by sector in a given year and a given province. The calculation steps are as \nfollows. First, we measure the actual distance between the provincial capitals and the \ntwo main international ports in Cambodia, namely Sihanoukville Autonomous Port (PAS), \nand Phnom Penh Autonomous Port (PPAP). In a second step, we calculate the weighted \n \n5  Wage data deflated across years using the 2005 PPP conversion factor with 2010 as the base year, taken \nfrom the World Development Indicators (WDI) to make them comparable across years. \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \ndistance between the provincial capitals and each port using the share of each container \nport6 based on Table 1 to reflect their relative importance in terms of the number of \ncontainers. As a third step, we calculate the index of weighted trade value by sector using \nthe data of trade values in US dollars and the quantity (kg) of three different sectors in \neach year, obtained from the UN Comtrade database. As a final step, we interact the \nweighted distance between provincial capitals and each port with the index of weighted \ntrade value by sector to obtain the values as an instrument, IV_km for FDIp,t, in equation \n[1]. \nTable 4: International Container Throughput (Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville)  \n   2009  2014 \nTotal container throughput  125,260  232,426 \nPhnom Penh  22,808  18%  71,561  31% \nSihanoukville  102,452  82%  160,865  69% \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on data provided by PPAP\u2019s Planning/Statistics Office and PAS. \n4.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n4.1  Impact of FDI on Labor Market Outcomes  \nTable 5 presents the estimation results of the garment sector for the three different \noutcome measures: (1) log of hourly wage; (2) log of monthly wage; and (3) the \nprobability that individuals at working age (15\u201364 years old) work in the formal sector. \nFor each outcome, the table shows the effect of FDI using both simple OLS regression \nand the IV estimate (2SLS). (The OLS and 2SLS regression results with all individual-\nlevel control variables are presented as Table A3 in the Appendix. Table A2 in the \nAppendix shows the results for the first stage for each outcome, documenting that there \nis  a  statistically  significant  and  strong  relationship  between  FDI  and  the  weighted \ndistance between provincial capitals and ports.) \nAs Table 5 indicates, our preferred model (2SLS) reveals the statistically significant and \npositive association between FDI and all three labor market outcomes. Our preferred \nmodel (2SLS) shows that if we increase FDI by 1%, we can expect that hourly wages will \nincrease  by  0.34%  (column  2)  and  monthly  wages  by  0.37%  \n(column 4), all else held constant. Similarly, the probability of an individual working in the \nformal sector also increases (column 6).  \nFurthermore, the results suggest that women earn significantly less per hour in the \ngarment sector compared to men, even when controlling for age and education as well \nas other control variables. Furthermore, the interaction term between FDI and the female \ndummy (taking the value of 1 if an individual is female), showing the gender effects of \nFDI, are negative and statistically significant at the 10% level. The interpretation of the \ncoefficient is that FDI does not seem to help to reduce the gender pay gap. In the case \nof formal employment, the coefficient of the interaction term is also negative but not \nsignificant. \n \n \n6  Given that the data for total container throughput by each port in 2004 are not available, we use the \nforecast function based on the share during the period from 2009 to 2014 to estimate the share of each \nport in 2004. The calculated values are 14% for PPAP and 86% for PAS. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \nTable 5: FDI and Labor Market Outcomes: Garment Sector \n  Hourly Wage  Log of Monthly Wage  Formal Employment \n  (1)  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5)  (6) \n  OLS  2SLS  OLS  2SLS  OLS  2SLS \nLog FDI  0.0155***  0.344***  0.0102**  0.375***  \u20130.0648***  0.135*** \n  (0.00379)  (0.0366)  (0.00388)  (0.0327)  (0.00825)  (0.0292) \nFDI x female  \u20130.00761*  \u20130.00761*  \u20130.00788  \u20130.00788*  \u20132.94e-05  \u20132.94e-05 \n  (0.00407)  (0.00394)  (0.00459)  (0.00444)  (0.0124)  (0.0120) \nFemale  \u20130.0622**  \u20130.374***  \u20130.0356*  \u20130.403***  \u20130.0146  \u20130.0146 \n  (0.0230)  (0.0381)  (0.0193)  (0.0353)  (0.0667)  (0.0645) \nObservations  5,202  5,202  5,246  5,246  6,037  6,037 \nR-squared  0.123  0.123  0.233  0.233  0.213  0.213 \nNote: Labor market outcomes of working age 15\u201364 years.

(The  regression  results  including  all  individual-level  control \nvariables are presented in Table A4 in the Appendix.) As shown in Table 6, our preferred \nmodel 2SLS shows a positive association between FDI and all three labor market \noutcomes. In particular, as the specifications in column (2) and (4) suggest, the impact \nof FDI on wages is large. If we increase FDI by 1%, we can expect that the wage level \nwill increase by 0.7%, all else held constant. Furthermore, the interaction term of FDI \nand the female dummy is negative and significant with regard to hourly wages. This result \nimplies that FDI slightly exacerbates the gender wage gap. Concerning the probability of \nformal employment, FDI apparently does not help women either: women are less likely \nto have formal employment, with or without FDI.  \nTable 6: FDI and Labor Market Outcomes: Other Manufacturing Sector  \n  Hourly Wage  Log of Monthly Wage  Formal Employment \n  (1)  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5)  (6) \n  OLS  2SLS  OLS  2SLS  OLS  2SLS \nLog of FDI  0.0556***  0.711***  0.0528***  0.737***  0.0375***  0.319*** \n  (0.00892)  (0.0878)  (0.00904)  (0.0978)  (0.0115)  (0.0481) \nFDI x female  \u20130.0494***  \u20130.0494***  \u20130.0459  \u20130.0459  0.00410  0.00410 \n  (0.0149)  (0.0143)  (0.0552)  (0.0529)  (0.0151)  (0.0146) \nFemale  \u20130.186***  \u20130.0806  \u20130.0555  \u20130.0555  \u20130.213***  \u20130.213*** \n  (0.0557)  (0.0824)  (0.248)  (0.237)  (0.0545)  (0.0527) \nObservations  1,222  1,222  1,225  1,225  3,001  3,001 \nR-squared  0.163  0.163  0.334  0.334  0.290  0.290 \nNote: Labor market outcomes of working age 15\u201364 years.

ROBUSTNESS CHECK \nAs a robustness check, we use the log of FDI with a one-year lag, FDIp,t-1. (The 2SLS \nestimation results with province-, year- and industry-fixed effects/other manufacturing \nare presented in Tables A5 to A6 in the Appendix.) The estimation results show that the \ncoefficient of FDI with a one-year lag is positive and highly significant in both the garment \nand the other manufacturing sectors for all of the labor market outcomes. Consistent with \nour main previous results, FDI with a one-year lag seems to help to increase hourly and \nmonthly wages, as well as the probability of working in formal sector. Again, the results \nof the coefficient of the interaction term between FDIp,t-1 and the female dummy variable \nare consistent with our main results, exhibiting a negative and significant relationship \nwith regard to hourly and monthly wages in the garment sector. In the case of other \nmanufacturing sectors, the interaction term turns positive and significant with regard to \nhourly wages, implying that there might be a time lag, as well as that FDI eventually helps \nto reduce the gender wage gap. \n6.  CONCLUSIONS \nAlthough there is a large body of literature analyzing the effects of FDI on labor market \noutcomes, there is still little evidence regarding gender effects. Furthermore, only a few \nstudies convincingly tackle the endogeneity problem. This paper has aimed to fill this \ngap by examining the gender effects of FDI on labor market outcomes in Cambodia with \nregard to wages and formality. We address the identification of causality problem by \nusing the weighted distance between the provincial capitals and two main international \nports in Cambodia as an instrument for FDI, arguing that access to foreign markets is \none of the main reasons behind FDI. Overall, our estimation results show a positive and \nhighly significant association between FDI and all three outcomes. FDI seems to lead to \nhigher wages and more formal employment. However, we cannot find evidence that FDI \nhelps to reduce the gender wage gap in either the garment sector or other manufacturing \nsectors.  \nThis study has provided new insights into the effects of FDI on labor market outcomes in \nCambodia.  We  have  found  that  increased  FDI  inflows  lead  to  higher  wages  as  \nwell as the probability of working in the formal sector. One reason for the higher  \nwages might be that foreign companies tend to be more productive compared to their \nlocal counterparts. Attracting FDI can therefore help Cambodia to increase overall \nproductivity and boost growth. However, as gender equality and women\u2019s economic \nempowerment are essential for inclusive growth in the country, it is important that foreign \ncompanies  also  contribute  to  more  gender-equal  outcomes.  Given  the  fact  \nthat most of the foreign companies offer formal employment, the government could urge \nforeign  investors  to  pay  equal  wages.  In  this  study  we  have  only  analyzed  \nthe manufacturing sector. It would thus be worth taking the research question and \napproach to other sectors, such as agriculture and services.  \n   \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1093  Helble and Takeda \n \nREFERENCES \nAitken, B., A.

empirical evidence on the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on various labor market outcomes, empirical studies on the effects on women remain very limited. We aim to contribute to this literature by examining the case of Cambodia. Using national household level data from the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey, we assess how FDI affects women\u2019s wages and formality compared to men in the manufacturing sector. We compare outcomes in the garment sector and in all other manufacturing sectors. We use exogenous variations of inward FDI across provinces linked to spatial differences in the initial industry\u2019s composition as an instrument to identify the causal effect of FDI on labor market outcomes. Our results indicate that FDI helps to increase wages and the probability of working in the formal sector, for both the garment sector and all other manufacturing sectors. However, we do not find evidence that FDI helps to reduce the gender wage gap in either.", "Title": "Do Women Benefit from FDI? FDI and Labor Market Outcomes in Cambodia"}}
