INTRODUCTION \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\nan \n\nincreasingly \n\nintegrated  world \n\nGender  equality  and  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  are  essential  to  fostering \neconomic growth, promoting social development, and enhancing business performance. \nWomen\u2019s labor force participation has been advancing in most countries, hand in hand \nwith \nthe  most  \nnotable features of international economic integration is foreign direct investment (FDI), \ndefined  as  a  cross-border  investment  by  a  person  (natural  or  legal)  exercising  \ncontrol or significant influence over the management of the enterprise abroad. FDI has \nreceived  considerable  attention  as  a  source  of  economic  development,  especially \nthrough  technology  transfer  (e.g.,  Nabin,  Nguyen,  and  Sgro  2013).  Considering  the \npotential  benefits,  many  governments  in  developing  and  emerging  economies  have \nundertaken substantive efforts to become an attractive destination for FDI.  \n\neconomy.  One \n\nof \n\nThe  impacts  of  FDI  on  host  countries\u2019  labor  markets  in  terms  of  wages  and  other \noutcomes have been studied extensively.1 However, we still have very limited empirical \nevidence  regarding  the  impact  of  FDI  on  gender-related  outcomes.  This  paper \ncontributes  to  this  sparse  literature  by  studying  the  impact  of  FDI  on  labor  market \noutcomes with a gender focus in Cambodia. Using nationally representative household \nsurvey data collected in 2004, 2009, and 2014, we investigate the relationship between \nFDI  and  women\u2019s  labor  market  outcomes  in  terms  of  wages  and  probability  of  formal \nemployment.  Our  study  focuses  on  paid  employment  in  manufacturing  (i.e.,  not  self-\nemployed). We split the manufacturing sector into two groups: the garment sector, and \nother  manufacturing  sectors.  The  garment  sector  has  represented  the  backbone  \nof Cambodia\u2019s economy in recent decades and is also the major employer of Cambodian \nwomen.  \n\nOne of the main challenges in the literature on FDI and labor-market outcomes is the \nidentification  problem,  which  arises  from  the  fact  that  FDI  is  not  randomly  distributed \nacross industries, regions, and countries (Hale and Xu 2016). Rather, FDI tends to occur \nin places where foreign companies expect high profitability, a phenomenon termed the \n\u201ccherry-picking  effect.\u201d  This  influences  the  labor  market  effects  of  FDI,  as  firms  with \npositive  prospects  tend  to  have  higher  wages  compared  to  prevailing  local  salaries. \nSeveral empirical studies on the impact of FDI simply use ordinary least squares (OLS) \nregressions  without  controlling  for  possible  endogeneity.  In  order  to  overcome  the \nidentification challenge, we employ an instrumental variables (IV) approach. We use the \nexogenous variations of inward FDI across provinces linked to spatial differences in the \nprovinces\u2019  initial  industry  composition  in  order  to  identify  the  causal  effects  of  FDI  on \nlabor market outcomes.  \n\nOverall, we find a statistically significant and positive relationship between FDI and key \nlabor market outcomes in terms of wages and the probability of working in the formal \nsector. Furthermore, our results reveal that FDI helps to eliminate the gender gap with \nregard to wages and, more importantly, probability of working in the formal sector in other \nmanufacturing sectors. Nevertheless, we also find that FDI does not lower the wage gap \nin the garment sector. \n\n1   Hale and Xu (2016) provide a meta-analysis demonstrating that FDI has positive effects on host countries\u2019 \n\nlabor markets.  \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1093 \n \n\n1.1  Literature Review \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\nThere is considerable literature regarding the relationship between FDI and labor market \noutcomes.  For  instance,  Aitken,  Harrison,  and  Lipsey  (1996),  Hunya  (1997),  and \nGolejewska  (2002)  all  argue  that  foreign-owned  firms  generally  pay  higher  wages \ncompared  with  their  domestic  counterparts.  This  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  foreign-\nowned  firms  use  more  advanced  technology  and  thus  require  higher  levels  of  skills. \nHowever,  we  find  only  a  few  studies  examining  the  impact  of  FDI  on  labor  market \noutcomes with a gender focus. For instance, Braunstein and Brenner (2007) examine \nthe  impact  of  FDI  on  the  pay  gap  between  female  and  male  workers  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). They find that this effect is contingent on whether the FDI is \ndirected  more  toward  male-  or  female-dominated  industries.  In  the  PRC,  early  FDI \nproved advantageous for women, but by 2002 men experienced larger wage gains from \nFDI than women due to industrial upgrading being more tilted toward male-dominated \nindustries.  \n\nThe literature on the impact of trade opening (measured in terms of tariff changes as \nopposed to FDI) on the gender wage gap usually finds that openness has helped women. \nFor  example,  Gaddis  and  Pieters  (2012)  provide  evidence  that  tariff  reductions  are \nassociated  with  an  increase  in  female  labor  force  participation  and  employment  \nin  Brazil.  They  also  address  the  identification  problem  of  trade  flows  using  the \ninstrumental  variable  approach.  Furthermore,  Kis-Katos,  Pieters,  and  Sparrow  (2018) \ninvestigate the gender-specific effects of trade liberalization in Indonesia, concluding that \na  reduction  in  input  tariffs  leads  to  improved  labor  opportunities  for  women,  and \nincreases their work participation and working hours.  Finally, Jamielaa and Kawabata \n(2018) study have studied the case of Indonesia, and show that trade openness helped \nto reduce the gender wage gap between 2008 and 2014. \n\nFinally, several empirical studies consider the impact of globalization (mostly categorized \nby trade integration) on informality, but the results are mixed. For the case of Brazil, Dix-\nCarneiro and Kovak (2017) find that regions facing larger tariff cuts have experienced \nmore  prolonged  declines  in  formal  sector  employment  and  earnings  relative  to  other \nregions. In contrast, McCaig and Pavcnik (2018), analyzing the impact of United States \n(US) tariff reductions on labor allocation in Viet Nam, demonstrate that these decrease \nthe probability of working for a household business, resulting in a reallocation of workers \ntoward the formal sector. Moreover, Ben Yahmed and Bombarda (2018) study the impact \nof trade liberalization on formal employment across gender in Mexico, with their results \nindicating  that  tariff  cuts  increase  the  probability  of  working  in  the  formal  sector, \nespecially for men. \n\n1.2  Trade and FDI Trends in Cambodia \n\nStarting in the 1970s, Cambodia experienced nearly two decades of political upheavals, \ncivil wars, and foreign occupation, leading to a substantial loss of human capital and all \ntypes of infrastructure. In 1989, the country underwent a drastic economic reform from a \ncentrally  planned  economy  to  a  market  economy.  The  economic  reform  included  the \nprivatization  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  integration  into  the  regional  and \nmultilateral trade architecture, and a favorable FDI regime through the establishment of \nspecial  economic  zones  (SEZ).  Cambodia  became  a  member  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area in 1999, and subsequently became \na member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in October 2004 as the first least-\ndeveloped country.  \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1093 \n \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\nFigure 1 displays the aggregate volume of exports by sector in Cambodia for the years \n1997 to 2015. The total volume of exports increased significantly from a total of $448 \nmillion in 1997 to $13.8 billion in 2015. In most years the garment sector generated more \nthan  90%  of  total  exports,  and  it  has  grown  impressively  over  the  past  two  decades, \nstarting from $302 million to become a $11.4 billion export industry in 2015. The garment \nsector has become the backbone of the country\u2019s economy, earning billions of dollars of \nforeign exchange and employing hundreds of thousands of workers (87% of whom are \nfemale), thereby significantly contributing to economic growth and poverty alleviation.  \n\nFigure 1: Cambodia\u2019s Exports by Sector (1997\u20132015) \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on UN Comtrade. \n\n \n\nRegarding  export  destinations,  the  garment  sector  in  Cambodia  heavily  relies  on  two \nmain  export  markets,  namely  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union  (EU),  which \ntogether account for 73% of total garment exports. Until 2011, the US was the largest \nmarket for the sector\u2019s exports, but the EU has since become more significant, as Figure \n2 shows. The surge of exports to the EU is mainly due to the EU\u2019s \u2018Everything But Arms\u2019 \n(EBA) scheme2 and its relaxation of the rules of origin3 in 2011. Given that Cambodia\u2019s \ngarment industry uses raw materials, fabrics, and other inputs that are mainly imported \nfrom  the  PRC,  more  flexible  rules  of  origin  have  enabled  it  to  qualify  for  preferential \nmarket access to the EU. \n\nTo  transform  and  modernize  Cambodia\u2019s  industrial  structure  from  a  labor-intensive \nindustry  to  a  skill-based  industry  by  2025,  the  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia  \n(2015)  has  adopted  an  Industrial  Development  Policy  2015\u20132025.  The  government \nestablished the policy to mobilize and attract FDI as a vehicle of economic growth and a \nkey driver of the growth of the formal sector. Figure 3 presents a trend in inward FDI \nstock in the manufacturing sector for the periods 2001 to 2014, based on data provided \nby the Central Bank of Cambodia as well as the authors\u2019 own calculations. During the \nentire period, a substantial proportion of FDI inflows were directed toward the garment \nsector, and increased in absolute terms from $3.2 million in 2001 to $2.6 billion in 2014. \nThe  garment  sector  was  the  most  successful  in  attracting  inward  FDI  into  Cambodia, \n\n \n\n2   The  EU\u2019s  generalized  system  of  preferences  (GSP),  which  grants  all  products  apart  from  arms  and \nammunition from 49 of the world\u2019s least developed countries (LDCs) duty-free and quota-free access to \nthe EU market. \n\n3   Rules that determine the criteria by which to decide whether goods were really produced or manufactured \n\nin the beneficiary country to which the preferential tariff treatment is granted.  \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1093 \n \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\nrepresenting about 70% of total FDI stock in manufacturing and 20% of total FDI stock \nincluding the service sector.  \n\nFigure 2: Cambodia\u2019s Garment Exports by Major Markets (1997\u20132005) \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on UN Comtrade. \n\nFigure 3: FDI Stock by Sector (Garment and Other Manufacturing) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Bank of Cambodia and authors calculations for years 2001 to 2007. \n\nRegarding  foreign  investors\u2019  countries  of  origin,  Figure  4  indicates  that  Cambodia\u2019s \ngarment sector is largely owned by foreign investors, mainly from the PRC. According to \nthe Garment Manufacturers' Association in Cambodia (GMAC)\u2019s estimate, out of a total \nof more than 600 garment factories, the share of 100% Cambodian-owned factories is \njust 5%. It should also be noted that the imports of inputs into the garment sector from \nthe  PRC  usually  enjoy  a  full  tariff  exemption  (Chheang  and  Hamanaka  2011).  The \ngovernment has granted these favorable terms to attract additional FDI from the PRC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1093 \n \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\nFigure 4: Ownership of Garment Factories  \n\nSource: Garment Manufacturers\u2019 Association of Cambodia. \n\n \n\n2.  DATA \n\n2.1  Data Sources \n\nThe data for the analyses are drawn from several different sources. First, the main data \nsource  of  our  study  is  a  nationally  representative  household  survey  collected  by  the \nNational  Institute  of  Statistics  (NIS)  under  the  Ministry  of  Planning  of  the  Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia, called the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES). The \nsurvey is conducted yearly, but every five years with a large sample size. We therefore \nuse the years 2004, 2009, and 2014 of large CSES data for the regression analyses. \nThese  three  waves  of  surveys  each  cover  between  12,000  and  15,000  households, \ncorresponding  to  54,000  to  75,000  individuals.  The  survey  provides  a comprehensive \nset  of  indicators  on  living  conditions  in  Cambodia,  covering  the  main  socio-economic \nareas such as health, education, and economic activities. We consider three key labor \nmarket  outcomes  \u2013  (1)  monthly  wages;  (2)  hourly  wages;  and  (3)  the  probability  that \nindividuals work in the formal sector (defined as workers whose employment status is \neither  employee  or  employer)  \u2013  all  referring  to  the  population  aged  between  15  and  \n64 years old. \n\nThe FDI data come from the Central Bank of Cambodia. FDI inflow data by sector have \nonly been recorded by the Central Bank since 2007. Indeed, prior to 2007, only the total \nFDI inflows are known. In order to proxy the FDI inflows by sector in 2004, we assume \nthat FDI had the same average share by industry as in the period from 2007 to 2014. \nFinally, to create an instrumental variable for FDI, we use the UN Comtrade database \n(repository of official international trade statistics) to obtain the trade value (US dollars) \nby sector. \n\n2.2  Descriptive Analysis \n\nTable 2 presents the gender ratio of paid employees in the garment sector and other \nmanufacturing sectors by year. As the table shows, females account for nearly 80% of \nthe workforce in the garment sector. By contrast, women only account for about 20% in \nthe other manufacturing sectors. Over time, in the garment sector as well as in the other \nmanufacturing  sectors,  women  have  seen  their  shares  fall,  which  might  indicate  that \nwomen are increasingly moving into service industries.  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1093 \n \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\nTable 2: Gender Ratio of Workers in Garment and Other Manufacturing Sectors \n\nYear \n2004 \n2009 \n2014 \n\nGarment \n\nFemale \n83.1% \n83.3% \n77.4% \n\nMale \n16.9% \n16.7% \n22.6% \n\nOther Manufacturing \nFemale \n23.8% \n15.0% \n16.2% \n\nMale \n76.2% \n85.0% \n83.8% \n\nSource: Authors calculations. \n\nTable  3  presents  summary  statistics  and  the  results  of  a  test  of  mean  difference  of \nseveral  labor  market  outcomes  using  the  CSES  data  in  2004,  2009,  and  2014.  As \nindicated in the table, women have a lower monthly income compared to men in both the \ngarment and other manufacturing sectors. However, when calculating the hourly wage, \nthe gender difference is no longer statistically insignificant.4  \n\nThe  table  also  compares  the  likelihood  of  being  formally  employed.  The  likelihood  of \nhaving formal employment is high in the garment sector. An overwhelming majority of \nworkers enjoy the benefit of a formal job, with men being slightly more likely than women.  \n\nThe reason for the high level of formality in the garment sector is the fact that this sector \nis largely owned and run by foreign investors that offer formal employment. In the other \nmanufacturing sectors, formal employment is much rarer. Only about a quarter of the \nfemale population are formally employed, in contrast to about half the male population. \nOverall, the gender disparities are more marked in the manufacturing sector than in the \ngarment sector.  \n\nTable 3: Summary Statistics of Labor Market Outcomes \n\nGarment \n\nOther Manufacturing \n\nFemal\ne \n176.27 \n\nMale \n188.35 \n\np-\nvalue \n0.01 \n\nFemal\ne \n152.23 \n\nMale \n196.51 \n\np-\nvalue \n0.00 \n\n0.85 \n0.87 \n\n0.89 \n0.90 \n\n0.20 \n0.00 \n\n0.91 \n0.25 \n\n0.96 \n0.51 \n\n0.58 \n0.00 \n\n  \nMonthly wage income (US$ purchasing \npower parity, PPP) \nHourly wage (US$ PPP) \nProbability of working in formal sector \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n3.  METHODOLOGY \n\n3.1  Calculation of FDI by Sector and by Province \n\nFirst,  to  calculate  inward  FDI  by  sector  and  by  province,  we  follow  Topalova\u2019s  (2010) \nmethodology  and  construct  a  region-level,  time-varying  measure  of  exposure  to  trade \nreforms. Namely, we calculate the provincial variation of inward FDI by sector based on \nthe employment share of each sector by province in 1997, prior to Cambodia joining the \nWTO and the expansion of FDI. In a first step, we divide the manufacturing sector into \ngarment  and  other  manufacturing,  comprising  the  manufacture  of  food  (37%),  wood \n\n4   Since 2013, the statutory minimum wage level in the garment sector has been rising, from $80 in 2013 to \n\n$100 in 2014, and $170 in 2018. \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1093 \n \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\n(36%), metal products (10%), and other (17%). Thus, we have two categories of sectors: \n(1) garment, and (2) other manufacturing.  \n\nIn a second step, using CSES 1997 data, we calculate the average employment share \nby each sector at the provincial level (Table A1 in the Appendix). In the third step, we \nuse the employment share as weights to allocate the total FDI amount in each year to \nthe sectoral and provincial level.

The estimation equation is the following: \n\nYi,p,t= \u03b1 +\u03b2FDI p,t + \u03b3 (Female i,p * FDI p)+ \u03b4X i,p,t +\u03bcr + \u028ei + \u03b8t +\u03b5i,p,t  \n\n[1] \n\nWhere Yi,p,t is an individual-level outcome, i , in a province, p, in a given year, t: (1) log \nof hourly wage5; (2) log of monthly wage; and (3) the probability that the individual works \nin the formal sector (working age between 15 and 64 years old). The FDI is the log of \ninward  FDI  stock  by  sector  (garment  and  other  manufacturing)  and  by  province  \nin a given year t, and\u03b2is the parameter estimate of interest. Furthermore, we include the \ninteraction  term  of  the  female  dummy  and  FDI  to  verify  the  differential  impact  of  \nFDI by gender. X is a vector of individual-level control variables (gender, age, square \nroot  of  age,  years  of  education,  marital  status,  urban  dummy,  household  size,  and \nnumber  of  children).  \u03bcis  a  province  fixed  effect  that  captures  unobserved  provincial \nheterogeneity, \u028e denotes industry fixed effects, while year-fixed effects, \u03b8, control for \nmacroeconomic  factors  and  other  trends  affecting  the  country  as  a  whole.  Finally, \nstandard errors are clustered at the provincial level. \n\nThis simple estimation strategy does not control for endogeneity. Possible endogeneity \narises from the fact that FDI flows are not randomly allocated across firms, industries, \nsectors, and regions. Indeed, foreign investors seek to invest in places that they view as \nhaving  high  growth  and  profitability  potential,  called  the  \u201ccherry-picking  effect.\u201d  This \nphenomenon  extends  to  the  labor  market  effects  of  FDI,  as  firms  with  positive  future \nprospects  tend  to  have  higher  wages  and  grow  faster  relative  to  their  peers.  Thus, \nemploying a simple OLS regression model [1] causes a biased estimate, \u03b2, so we tackle \nthis identification problem by using the IV approach. This enables us to identify variation \nin the FDI measure that is not due to the firm\u2019s expected growth prospects, and to use \nthis variation of FDI to measure the impact as a fully exogenous portion.  \n\nTo instrument for FDI, we use the fact that good access to foreign markets is an important \nconsideration behind the foreign investment into Cambodia. Thus, we use the weighted \ndistance between provincial capitals and ports in interaction with an index of weighted \ntrade values by sector in a given year and a given province. The calculation steps are as \nfollows. First, we measure the actual distance between the provincial capitals and the \ntwo main international ports in Cambodia, namely Sihanoukville Autonomous Port (PAS), \nand Phnom Penh Autonomous Port (PPAP). In a second step, we calculate the weighted \n\n5   Wage data deflated across years using the 2005 PPP conversion factor with 2010 as the base year, taken \n\nfrom the World Development Indicators (WDI) to make them comparable across years. \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1093 \n \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\ndistance between the provincial capitals and each port using the share of each container \nport6 based  on  Table  1  to  reflect  their  relative  importance  in  terms  of  the  number  of \ncontainers. As a third step, we calculate the index of weighted trade value by sector using \nthe data of trade values in US dollars and the quantity (kg) of three different sectors in \neach year, obtained from the UN Comtrade database. As a final step, we interact the \nweighted distance between provincial capitals and each port with the index of weighted \ntrade value by sector to obtain the values as an instrument, IV_km for FDIp,t, in equation \n[1]. \n\nTable 4: International Container Throughput (Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville)  \n\n  \n\nTotal container throughput \nPhnom Penh \nSihanoukville \n\n2009 \n125,260 \n\n2014 \n232,426 \n\n22,808 \n102,452 \n\n18% \n82% \n\n71,561 \n160,865 \n\n31% \n69% \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on data provided by PPAP\u2019s Planning/Statistics Office and PAS. \n\n4.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n\n4.1  Impact of FDI on Labor Market Outcomes  \n\nTable  5  presents  the  estimation  results  of  the  garment  sector  for  the  three  different \noutcome  measures:  (1)  log  of  hourly  wage;  (2)  log  of  monthly  wage;  and  (3)  the \nprobability that individuals at working age (15\u201364 years old) work in the formal sector. \nFor each outcome, the table shows the effect of FDI using both simple OLS regression \nand the IV estimate (2SLS). (The OLS and 2SLS regression results with all individual-\nlevel  control  variables  are  presented  as  Table  A3  in  the  Appendix.  Table  A2  in  the \nAppendix shows the results for the first stage for each outcome, documenting that there \nis  a  statistically  significant  and  strong  relationship  between  FDI  and  the  weighted \ndistance between provincial capitals and ports.) \n\nAs Table 5 indicates, our preferred model (2SLS) reveals the statistically significant and \npositive  association  between  FDI  and  all  three  labor  market  outcomes.  Our  preferred \nmodel (2SLS) shows that if we increase FDI by 1%, we can expect that hourly wages will \nincrease \n0.37%  \n(column 4), all else held constant. Similarly, the probability of an individual working in the \nformal sector also increases (column 6).  \n\nand  monthly  wages \n\n(column \n\n0.34% \n\nby \n\nby \n\n2) \n\nFurthermore,  the  results  suggest  that  women  earn  significantly  less  per  hour  in  the \ngarment sector compared to men, even when controlling for age and education as well \nas other control variables. Furthermore, the interaction term between FDI and the female \ndummy (taking the value of 1 if an individual is female), showing the gender effects of \nFDI, are negative and statistically significant at the 10% level. The interpretation of the \ncoefficient is that FDI does not seem to help to reduce the gender pay gap. In the case \nof  formal  employment,  the  coefficient  of  the  interaction  term  is  also  negative  but  not \nsignificant. \n\n \n\n \n\n6   Given  that  the  data  for  total  container  throughput  by  each  port  in  2004  are  not  available,  we  use  the \nforecast function based on the share during the period from 2009 to 2014 to estimate the share of each \nport in 2004. The calculated values are 14% for PPAP and 86% for PAS. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1093 \n \n\nHelble and Takeda \n\nTable 5: FDI and Labor Market Outcomes: Garment Sector \n\n \n\nHourly Wage \n\nLog of Monthly Wage \n\nFormal Employment \n\n \n \nLog FDI \n \nFDI x female \n \nFemale \n \nObservations \nR-squared \n\n(1) \nOLS \n0.0155*** \n(0.00379) \n\u20130.00761* \n(0.00407) \n\u20130.0622** \n(0.0230) \n5,202 \n0.123 \n\n(2) \n2SLS \n0.344*** \n(0.0366) \n\u20130.00761* \n(0.00394) \n\u20130.374*** \n(0.0381) \n5,202 \n0.123 \n\n(3) \nOLS \n0.0102** \n(0.00388) \n\u20130.00788 \n(0.00459) \n\u20130.0356* \n(0.0193) \n5,246 \n0.233 \n\n(4) \n2SLS \n0.375*** \n(0.0327) \n\u20130.00788* \n(0.00444) \n\u20130.403*** \n(0.0353) \n5,246 \n0.233 \n\n(5) \nOLS \n\u20130.0648*** \n(0.00825) \n\u20132.94e-05 \n(0.0124) \n\u20130.0146 \n(0.0667) \n6,037 \n0.213 \n\n(6) \n2SLS \n0.135*** \n(0.0292) \n\u20132.94e-05 \n(0.0120) \n\u20130.0146 \n(0.0645) \n6,037 \n0.213 \n\nNote: Labor market outcomes of working age 15\u201364 years.

(The  regression  results  including  all  individual-level  control \nvariables are presented in Table A4 in the Appendix.) As shown in Table 6, our preferred \nmodel  2SLS  shows  a  positive  association  between  FDI  and  all  three  labor  market \noutcomes. In particular, as the specifications in column (2) and (4) suggest, the impact \nof FDI on wages is large. If we increase FDI by 1%, we can expect that the wage level \nwill increase by 0.7%, all else held constant. Furthermore, the interaction term of FDI \nand the female dummy is negative and significant with regard to hourly wages. This result \nimplies that FDI slightly exacerbates the gender wage gap. Concerning the probability of \nformal employment, FDI apparently does not help women either: women are less likely \nto have formal employment, with or without FDI.  \n\nTable 6: FDI and Labor Market Outcomes: Other Manufacturing Sector  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nLog of FDI \n \nFDI x female \n \nFemale \n \nObservations \nR-squared \n\nHourly Wage \n\nLog of Monthly Wage \n\nFormal Employment \n\n(1) \nOLS \n0.0556*** \n(0.00892) \n\u20130.0494*** \n(0.0149) \n\u20130.186*** \n(0.0557) \n1,222 \n0.163 \n\n(2) \n2SLS \n0.711*** \n(0.0878) \n\u20130.0494*** \n(0.0143) \n\u20130.0806 \n(0.0824) \n1,222 \n0.163 \n\n(3) \nOLS \n0.0528*** \n(0.00904) \n\u20130.0459 \n(0.0552) \n\u20130.0555 \n(0.248) \n1,225 \n0.334 \n\n(4) \n2SLS \n0.737*** \n(0.0978) \n\u20130.0459 \n(0.0529) \n\u20130.0555 \n(0.237) \n1,225 \n0.334 \n\n(5) \nOLS \n0.0375*** \n(0.0115) \n0.00410 \n(0.0151) \n\u20130.213*** \n(0.0545) \n3,001 \n0.290 \n\n(6) \n2SLS \n0.319*** \n(0.0481) \n0.00410 \n(0.0146) \n\u20130.213*** \n(0.0527) \n3,001 \n0.290 \n\nNote: Labor market outcomes of working age 15\u201364 years.

ROBUSTNESS CHECK \n\nAs a robustness check, we use the log of FDI with a one-year lag, FDIp,t-1. (The 2SLS \nestimation  results  with  province-,  year-  and  industry-fixed  effects/other  manufacturing \nare presented in Tables A5 to A6 in the Appendix.) The estimation results show that the \ncoefficient of FDI with a one-year lag is positive and highly significant in both the garment \nand the other manufacturing sectors for all of the labor market outcomes. Consistent with \nour main previous results, FDI with a one-year lag seems to help to increase hourly and \nmonthly wages, as well as the probability of working in formal sector. Again, the results \nof the coefficient of the interaction term between FDIp,t-1 and the female dummy variable \nare  consistent  with  our  main  results,  exhibiting  a  negative  and  significant  relationship \nwith  regard  to  hourly  and  monthly  wages  in  the  garment  sector.  In  the  case  of  other \nmanufacturing sectors, the interaction term turns positive and significant with regard to \nhourly wages, implying that there might be a time lag, as well as that FDI eventually helps \nto reduce the gender wage gap. \n\n6.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nAlthough there is a large body of literature analyzing the effects of FDI on labor market \noutcomes, there is still little evidence regarding gender effects. Furthermore, only a few \nstudies  convincingly  tackle  the  endogeneity  problem.  This  paper  has  aimed  to  fill  this \ngap by examining the gender effects of FDI on labor market outcomes in Cambodia with \nregard  to  wages  and  formality.  We  address  the  identification  of  causality  problem  by \nusing the weighted distance between the provincial capitals and two main international \nports in Cambodia as an instrument for FDI, arguing that access to foreign markets is \none of the main reasons behind FDI. Overall, our estimation results show a positive and \nhighly significant association between FDI and all three outcomes. FDI seems to lead to \nhigher wages and more formal employment. However, we cannot find evidence that FDI \nhelps to reduce the gender wage gap in either the garment sector or other manufacturing \nsectors.  \n\nThis study has provided new insights into the effects of FDI on labor market outcomes in \nCambodia.  We  have  found  that  increased  FDI  inflows  lead  to  higher  wages  as  \nwell  as  the  probability  of  working  in  the  formal  sector.  One  reason  for  the  higher  \nwages might be that foreign companies tend to be more productive compared to their \nlocal  counterparts.  Attracting  FDI  can  therefore  help  Cambodia  to  increase  overall \nproductivity  and  boost  growth.  However,  as  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  economic \nempowerment are essential for inclusive growth in the country, it is important that foreign \nfact  \ncompanies  also  contribute \nthat most of the foreign companies offer formal employment, the government could urge \nforeign  investors  to  pay  equal  wages.  In  this  study  we  have  only  analyzed  \nthe  manufacturing  sector.  It  would  thus  be  worth  taking  the  research  question  and \napproach to other sectors, such as agriculture and services.  \n\nto  more  gender-equal  outcomes.

Using \nnational household level data from the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey, we assess how \nFDI affects women\u2019s wages and formality compared to men in the manufacturing sector. We \ncompare  outcomes  in  the  garment  sector  and  in  all  other  manufacturing  sectors.  We  use \nexogenous variations of inward FDI across provinces linked to spatial differences in the initial \nindustry\u2019s composition as an instrument to identify the causal effect of FDI on labor market \noutcomes. Our results indicate that FDI helps to increase wages and the probability of working \nin the formal sector, for both the garment sector and all other manufacturing sectors. However, \nthe  gender  wage  gap  \nwe  do  not \nin either. \n \nKeywords: foreign direct investment, labor market, gender, Cambodia \n \nJEL Classification: F16, J31 \n \n", "that  FDI  helps \n", "find  evidence \n", "reduce \n", "to \n", " \n"]}
