Conclusions         \n  2", "Abstract \n \n \nThe paper uses a dualistic, compact and \u201cgeneric\u201d (macroeconomic) computable general \nequilibrium (CGE) model specially constructed for the purpose of investigating the \nimplications of trade liberalization for  poverty reduction in South Asia. The model is a \nstylized representation of economies with large populations including large numbers of both \nurban and rural poor as in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. The current \u201cgeneric\u201d model uses \nCES production functions and Harris-Todaro type migration model together with \nrepresentative data to generate economy wide results. It is found that a dualistic production \nstructure with sufficient details on the labor markets and household side can capture some of \nthe effects of trade liberalization on poverty reduction. The model\u2019s general equilibrium \nresults suggest that trade liberalization can complement other specific policy interventions for \npoverty reduction.  \n \n  3", "Executive Summary \n \nThe main purpose of this paper is to use a \u201cgeneric\u201d computable general equilibrium \nmodel in order to understand the poverty reduction impact of trade liberalization policies in \nSouth Asia. Understanding the impacts of trade liberalization policies in South Asia on \npoverty is important because of the vulnerability of the poor as a group in developing \neconomies in general and in South Asia in particular.  \n \n   \n  There are at least two aspects of any poverty impact analysis for a particular policy. \nThese are: i) the impact on economic growth; ii) the impact on income and asset distribution. \nThe growth effect on poverty reduction is then given by some estimated growth-poverty \nelasticity. In the second case, a more (less) favorable income/asset distribution for the poor \nmay reduce (increase) poverty. A distributional neutrality assumption in a model simply allows \none to look at the growth aspect by itself. Here, too, different sectoral growth rates and \ndifferent sectors themselves may affect poverty differently.  \n \n  The paper is structured in such a way that the connection between the basic policy \nissues and the particular modeling approaches can be discussed in a transparent manner. It \nbegins with a discussion of the general macroeconomic policy issues arising out of program \nlending and their relevance to the poverty reduction strategy in the \u201cpost-Washington \nconsensus\u201d policy environment. This raises some relevant questions regarding the \nmeasurement of poverty and the nature of macroeconomic environment in the developing \neconomies. Consequently, it becomes necessary to discuss these measurement issues in \nthe context of particular environments in South Asian economies. Thus the measurement \naspects of poverty are followed up by a discussion of some pertinent issues regarding the \ngeneric structure of macro-models for South Asian economies. A concrete discussion of \nreforms, in particular, trade liberalization in South Asia is taken up next.After this section, the \nquestion of what is the relevant class of CGE models for an analysis of trade liberalization \nand poverty in South Asia is addressed in section 6. Specifically, this section explores the \nquestions related to income distribution and poverty in CGE models for South Asian \ndeveloping economies. In the penultimate section (section 7), I discuss the structure of what \nhas been termed the \u201cdual-dual\u201d model. Results from a modified \u201cdual-dual\u201d model using \nlargely a data set from India are presented and discussed.  \n \n              Within this particular CGE model, the policy experiments show that in this \nregion, trade liberalization can lead to further poverty reduction. This is true at both the \nnational level and at the level of the various household groups. This is indeed good news that \nconforms to the general prediction of the standard comparative advantage based trade \ntheory. \n \n           Under the assumptions of the model, the results show that in general, \nboth the extent and depth of poverty decline for each household group. The largest \nheadcount ratio drop is recorded for the rural unskilled group. Poverty severity also falls for \neach household group with the exception of the urban unskilled workers. But when the tariff \nrates fall from 15 to 12 percent, this group benefits as well. In general though, much of the \npoverty reduction impact of trade liberalization can be reaped earlier. Further reductions \nleading to a rate below 10 per cent may not have much more of an impact than earlier tariff \nreductions. One surprise, however, is the largely nonlinear impact of tariff reductions on \npoverty. There seems to be a big jump nationally when the tariff rate is finally reduced to a \nlow range of 15 to 18 percent.. However, there is very little change for even lower rates, for \nexample, From 15% to 12%.Given the stylized nature of the exercise, no magical properties \nneed to be attributed to these particular  numbers. The general lesson is that tariff reduction \nwill ultimately benefit the poor; but the trickling down process is uneven and may require \nsome time to work through the socio-economic system.   \n  4", " \n \nThe extent of poverty reduction impact of trade liberalization turns out to be limited. \nThere are several reasons for this. The main reason is that the Harris-Todaro mechanism \nallows reverse migration to lower paid jobs for the potentially unemployed as protection is \nremoved. Furthermore, the impact of further tariff reductions becomes attenuated for most \ngroups when the tariff levels are lowered sufficiently. On the whole, the high tariff barriers \nshould be dismantled, but beyond a certain point---say about 15 per cent average tariff rate--- \nthe further impacts become negligible. \n \nSeveral policy conclusions can be reached regarding poverty reduction strategies in \nSouth Asia in light of the findings here. Trade liberalization certainly does not conflict with \npoverty reduction and hence can be pursued without fearing adverse poverty impact. \nHowever, the approach may need to be a firm but gradual liberalization with special \nsensitivity to agriculture and the rural poor. It should also be kept in mind that trade \nliberalization can certainly help reduce poverty, but by itself it may not be the magic bullet \nagainst poverty. The actual poverty reduction impact in South Asia is most likely to remain \nsmall for this policy instrument. Hence other growth enhancing reforms need to be pursued \nsimultaneously.   \nFurthermore, targeted poverty reduction programs may also be needed with \nemphasis on increasing the efficiency of targeting and improving their \ncost-effectiveness.Programs such as food-for\u2013work and other employment \nschemes,microfinance, agricultural credit etc. need to be pursued with a focus on making \nthem more effective in terms of reaching the targeted groups at minimum cost to the \nprograms. Rural industrialization and increase in productivity through investment in social \nsectors and human capital also remain viable policy options. In terms of Sen\u2019s capabilities \napproach, the capabilities of the poor--- particularly their basic functionings--- need to be \nenhanced so that they can better participate in income earning activities. Some of these \npolicy areas are related to trade, but many are not .This paper does not analyze these further \npolicy issues that are not related to trade  directly but the need to use existing works along \nthese lines and to continue doing careful research in the South Asian context in particular is \napparent. \n \n    \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  5", "1. Introduction \n \n \nThe debate about the impact of globalization on the well-being of people has already \ngenerated a large literature.1Here I focus on one particular aspect of globalization, namely, \ntrade liberalization. I also focus on the well-being of one particular group, namely, the poor.2 \nUnderstanding the impacts of trade liberalization on income (and wealth) distribution and \npoverty is important because of the vulnerability of the poor as a group in developing \neconomies. The literature on trade liberalization emphasizes the elimination of distortions \nleading to both gains from trade and an increase in domestic economic activities leading to \nsustained growth. To the extent that the poor are also beneficiaries of these outcomes, \npoverty is expected to decline. \n \n  However establishing the link between this type of trade liberalization or trade reform in \ngeneral associated, for example, with WTO entry and poverty reduction requires more than \njust a description or projection of trade patterns. A counterfactual \u201cno-change\u201d scenario must \nbe compared with an estimated scenario after liberalization. An appealing way of addressing \nthis is to formulate and use an appropriate computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that \ncompares the non-liberalized case with scenarios based on trade liberalization. For example, \nRoland-Holst (2002) and (2003) applies a version of the well-known GTAP model to assess \nthe impact of reform on trade and income for some regions of Asia and PRC. His model is \naggregated and covers 16 countries and 18 sectors with CES production functions.3 Recent \nwork on trade and development has also emphasized the importance of considering the \nresponse of the informal sector to trade liberalization and the importance of modeling specific \ninstitutional aspects of particular labor markets.4 The complexity of the links between trade \nand poverty have been analyzed by Alan Winters and his coauthors in particular (Winters \n2000, 2002 and the references therein). \n \n \n  This paper has two related goals. The first and the main aim is to present a \u201cgeneric\u201d, \nstylized CGE model for South Asia within which certain policy experiments about trade \nliberalization can be carried out. The second, related objective is to use \u2018real world\u2019 country \ndata from South Asia to carry out some experiments with respect to the progressive removal \nof tariff barriers. I use largely data from India with some exceptions. However the results \nshould be indicative of what can be expected for other South Asian economies with large \npopulations and large numbers of poor people in both the urban and rural areas. \n \n  The emphasis on poverty reduction at the national and international levels as \nembodied for example, in the Millennium Development Goals, calls for a careful \nmethodological approach to the estimation of the poverty reduction impacts of changes in \nmacroeconomic, trade and other policy variables. A recent report produced at the Asian \nDevelopment Bank sorts out many of the complex issues involved at the macro-, meso- and \nmicro-economic levels and pinpoints the need for further conceptual and modelling work at \n                                                  \n1 For a recent survey, see Khan(2004d), and Rahman(2004). \n2 One way to defend this approach theoretically is to appeal to the Rawlsian maximin criterion. Alternatively, \nSen\u2019s capabilities approach can be used to argue that addressing issues related to poverty reduction will help a \nsociety towards equalization of capabilities. \n3 See Weiss(2004), pp. 17-19, for a succinct discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of such models, and for \nfurther details see Roland-Holst (2002), and Lee et. al.(2004). Their models are based on Van der Mensbrugghe\u2019s \nLINKAGE model.A recent documentation with technical details can be found in Van der Mensbrugghe(2003) See \nalso,  Van  der  Mensbrugghe(1998).  More  directly  relevant  to  our  generic  modeling  approach  with  special \nemphasis on poverty reduction is the paper by Stifel and Thorbecke(2003). \n \n \n4 See for example, Goldberg, P. K. and N. Pavcnik(2004) and Galiani and Sanguinetti(2004). \n  6", "the appropriate levels of (dis)aggregation(Bolt et.al.2003).The identification of the three \ndifferent levels and treating the meso-economic level as the (institutional) link between the \nother two levels are encouraging in terms of understanding the complex causal relations that \nare involved in understanding and reducing poverty.  \n \n    There are at least two aspects of any poverty impact analysis for a \nparticular policy. These are: i) the impact on economic growth; ii) the impact on income and \nasset distribution. The growth effect on poverty reduction is then given by some estimated \ngrowth-poverty elasticity. In the second case, a more (less) favorable income/asset \ndistribution for the poor may reduce (increase) poverty. A distributional neutrality assumption \nin a model simply allows one to look at the growth aspect by itself. Here, too, different \nsectoral growth rates and different sectors themselves may affect poverty differently. (Quibria \n2002; Khan 1999; Thorbecke and Jung 1996). Thus the dynamic and disaggregated growth \nimpacts of trade liberalization may ultimately be the key intervening variables. From this \noverall perspective, the present endeavor may be seen as a first step to capture the poverty \nimpact of trade liberalization through a comparative statics experiment in a generic CGE \nmodel.  \n \n \n \n  The structure of the paper is as follows. In the following section I discuss the general \nmacroeconomic policy issues arising out of program lending and their relevance to the \npoverty reduction strategy in the \u201cpost-Washington consensus\u201d policy environment and trade \nliberalization. This raises some pertinent questions regarding the measurement of poverty \nand the nature of macroeconomic environment in the developing economies. Consequently, \nin the two sections following immediately, I discuss these issues in the context of developing \neconomies. In section 3, I deal with some fundamental issues for the measurement of \npoverty. This is followed up in section 4 by a discussion of some issues regarding the general \nstructure of macro-models as they may relate to the salient characteristics related to the \ndualistic nature of some South Asian economies. Section 5 then takes up the specific issue \nof recent history of reforms in South Asia via a discussion of the Indian case from 1991 to \n2004. Section 6 explores specifically the questions related to income distribution and poverty \nin CGE models for developing economies in general and for South Asia in particular. In the \npenultimate section (section 7), I discuss the structure of what has been termed the \n\u201cdual-dual\u201dclass of models and offer a modified version of the Stifel-Thorbecke dual-dual \nmodel for analyzing the poverty impacts of trade liberalization in South Asia. The model is \nimplemented empirically by using largely data from India In the concluding section I raise the \nquestion of how applicable the model is for other regions, e.g., some middle income Asian \neconomies with large pockets of poverty. I end with some tentative suggestions regarding \npoverty analysis in an \u201cextended dual-dual\u201d framework for a middle income Asian economy \nsuch as Thailand and People\u2019s Republic of China as well as some other modifications \nincluding a more micro poverty analysis. \n \n  At the outset it is fair to mention that even the poverty \u2018incidence analysis\u2019 at the \nmicro level is not as straightforward as it seems. For example, even cash transfers may \nmodify behavior. Such modifications can lead to general equilibrium effects in an economy \nwide set of repercussions. Typically, of course, most transfers are made indirectly--- through \npublic spending and indirect taxation. The allocation rules are not always transparent and \nimplementation is incomplete or distorted (Bourguignon et. al. 2002). More relevant to our \npurpose here, often macroeconomic and structural adjustment instruments and outcomes are \nalso involved. The declared purpose of such reforms is to enhance economic activity and \nlong-term rate of growth. In the short-run, however, the effects may even run in the opposite \ndirection. A careful specification of the macro-models and the macro-micro linkage is thus a \nprerequisite for any meaningful and policy-relevant economic analysis. \n  7", " \n  Essentially there are three levels that such a relatively complete analysis of poverty \nreduction impacts of macro-policy changes would involve. First level includes the \nmacroeconomic tools and models that will allow us to estimate and evaluate the impact of \nvarious exogenous shocks and policies on macro or aggregate variables such as the \nGDP/capita and its macro-components, the rate of interest, inflation/deflation via changes in \nthe aggregate price level, the exchange rate and so on. The time frame must also be made \nexplicit. At the second level we need to have tools and procedures for disaggregating the \nvalues of the variables obtained through our modelling and estimation exercises at the first \nlevel. Thus, at the end of our procedures at this level we will have at our disposal a \ndisaggregated picture of the effects of policies on sectoral activities, and returns to factors \nand households at the appropriate levels of disaggregation. The last, bottom layer usually \nconsists of a micro-module where an \u2018incidence analysis\u2019 can be carried out through the \nmanipulation of household micro data with the help of relevant theories of distribution, \nhousehold income generation and consumption.  \n \n  Our earlier review of the CGE models (Khan2004a) revealed that for developing \neconomies the useful CGE models can be conveniently categorized in three \u201cgenerational\u201d \nclasses.5 The first generation, starting with the pioneering works of Taylor and Lysy (1980) \nand Adelman and Robinson (1979) in the late 70s and the 80s focused increasingly on trade \npolicy issues. The second generation in the late 80s and 90s made income distribution in the \ncontext of structural adjustment policies as the main focus, although it must be added that \nthe pioneering works in both the Lysy and Taylor volume, and the Adelman-Robinson volume \ndid not neglect distribution. The main difference is the explicit reckoning with Structural \nAdjustment Programs (SAPs). In the late 90s, explicit attention began to be paid to the \npoverty impact of SAPs within a CGE modelling context. In this context, with the Work of \nDecaluwe et. al. (1999), we seem to be in the third generation of CGE models where poverty \nimpact has been modeled explicitly. The present work may be said to belong to this \u201cthird \ngeneration\u201d of models for poverty analysis under globalization in a general equilibrium setting \nfor Asian Developing Economies (ADEs).6 \n                                                  \n5 Like all historical classifications of ideas or schools of thought,this one also involves some arbitrariness. There \nis much overlap among the \u201cgenerations\u201d and at times, prescient anticipations of latter work. However, the \ncategorization according to some prevalent general features during a particular period can still serve as a \nconvenient marker or guidepost if we do not apply it in too rigid a manner.  \n6 See also Clautier et. als.(2002) for a review of the CGE literature on the impact of trade liberalization on welfare \nand poverty. Cororaton(2003) is a detailed study of the Philippine tariff reform using the CGE-Microsimulation \napproach. \n  8", " \n2. Some General Considerations: Trade Liberalization and Poverty Reduction in \nthe Post- Washington Consensus Environment \n \n \nThe policy environment after the Washington consensus has increasingly moved towards \nboth consolidating and augmenting the first generation reforms (Kuczynski and Williamson \n2003). As is well known, in 1989, John Williamson had dubbed a list of ten reforms in Latin \nAmerica \u201cthe Washington consensus\u201d(Williamson 1990). The appellation gained wide \ncurrency and some may say, even notoriety. It covered the following ten points: \n \n1.  Budget deficits \u2026 small enough to be financed without recourse to the inflation tax. \n \n2.  Public expenditures redirected from politically sensitive areas that receive more \nresources than their economic returns can justify\u2026 toward neglected fields with high \neconomic returns and the potential to improve income distribution, such as primary \neducation, health and infrastructure. \n \n \n3.  tax reform \u2026 so as to broaden the tax base and cut marginal tax rates. \n \n4.  Financial liberalization, involving an ultimate objective of market determined interest \nrates. \n \n \n5.  A unified exchange rate at a level sufficiently competitive to induce a rapid growth in \nnontraditional exports. \n \n6.  Quantitative trade restrictions to be rapidly replaced by tariffs, which would be \nprogressively reduced until a uniform low rate in the range of 10 to 20 per cent was \nachieved. \n \n \n7.  Abolition of barriers that impede the entry of new firms or restrict competition. \n \n8.  Privatization of state-owned enterprises. \n \n9.  Abolition of regulations that impede the entry of foreign direct investment. \n \n \n10. The provision of secure property rights, especially to the informal sector. \n \nAs Williamson himself admits, \u201c\u2026from the start, the term \u201cWashington Consensus\u201d evoked \ncontroversy\u201d. Moreover the mixed results in the decade of the 1990s and the financial crises \nin Latin America, Asia and Russia led to some recent rethinking and a proposal from some \neconomists for an \u201cAugmented Washington Consensus\u201d (Rodrik 2002). The augmented list \nincludes as \u201csecond generation\u201d reform agenda a wide range of items from social safety nets \nand poverty reduction to anti-corruption policies and legal and institutional reforms. Some \nhave pointed out that the expanded list sometimes expresses hopes and goals rather than \nspecific policies. There is some truth to this. However, the expanded list does put the task of \npoverty reduction squarely on the agenda and raises important questions regarding whether \nand how the program loans and the conditionalities attached to them would lead to increased \npoverty reduction in the developing world.7  \n                                                  \n7 There is, of course, the question of whether even the second generation of reforms will lead to the kind of \n  9", " \n  In this paper I focus on item no. 6 on Williamson\u2019s list of \u201cfirst generation\u201d reforms. \nHowever, it should be acknowledged that the trade liberalization part of the reforms usually \ndoes not occur in isolation, but rather is part of a larger package of reforms. This has \ncertainly been true in South Asia where budgetary retrenchments and other reforms have \naccompanied trade liberalization. \n  \n   \nOn the macroeconomic side, the indirect effects of policy reform including trade liberalization \non poverty reduction are mainly expected to work through generating rapid growth( Berg and \nKrueger 2003, Srinivasan 2001, Quibria 2002). The growth-poverty elasticity is the crucial \nparameter here. We do have some evidence from a survey of the existing macro-models. In \nparticular, the empirical relation between growth and poverty (Ravallion and Chen(1997), de \nJanvry and Sadoulet(1998), Agenor(2002)) estimated by using linear regressions where the \nchange in the measured levels of poverty are explained by the growth of income or GDP/ \ncapita and other variables can offer some useful policy guidance. The main lessons are that \ngrowth tends to reduce poverty, but the cross-sectional nature of this work makes it hard to \napply it to any specific country.(see also Bourguignon(2002)). Hence the estimate in the \ncross-section that the poverty elasticity of growth is about 2, is not automatically operational \nfor every case. Estimates for particular countries derived from plausible models using reliable \neconometric methodology are necessary.8 The postulation of an automatic trade-poverty \nreduction causality that works directly and rapidly is a hypothesis that needs to be tested, \nrather than to be accepted as an a priori axiom. \n                                                                                                                                                            \nsustained growth and poverty reduction that is anticipated. See for example, Hayami(2003) for questioning   the \nview that growth and poverty reduction are sustainable. In particular, Hayami raises the issues of infrastructure \nbuilding and other public investment projects that may still need to be undertaken by the public sector in order to \nmake growth and poverty reduction sustainable.See also Naim(1994,2000,2002). \n8 An important ADB document(Weiss 2003) recognizes this point by pointing to the link between growth and \nspecific social expenditure categories and refers to some specific programs in three different countries. This type \nof analysis is clearly necessary, but may be too disaggregated for macromodels to address. However, much \ninsight can be gained by such specific analyses alongside the standard multisectoral macro models. As the \ndocument points out: \n \nGrowth \u201c\u2026would allow greater expenditure to meet social development goals. Whether this expenditure is \nactually made by the public sector will vary depending upon government commitments to social targets, although \na lack of public sector response can be compensated in part by private or NGO provision. Efficiency in public \nprovision of social \u2013 essentially health and education services \u2013 has been addressed by recent program loans for \nthese sectors, although their share of total program lending is small. A survey of program lending since mid-1999 \nreveals three main loans aimed explicitly at social development goals \u2013 the Health and Nutrition Sector \nDevelopment Policy loan to Indonesia (March 1999), the Bangladesh Secondary Education Sector Development \nProgram loan (June 1999) and the Bhutan Health Care Reform loan (September 2000). Of these the first aimed at \nmaintaining social services in the face of declining government revenue in the wake of the Financial Crisis. The \nother two loans aimed at general improvement in the efficiency of the education and health sectors, respectively. \nGovernance issues are addressed directly by loans for public sector reform and privatization, as well as by \nprograms designed specifically to address the legal and justice system. The more common program lending for \ngovernance purposes has had as the major objective improved public resource management and increased \nrevenue collection capacity; for example the Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management program (December \n1999) and the Governance Reform program in Mongolia (December 1999). Overtly political governance issues \nhave been addressed in just a very small number of cases, notably the Decentralization Support program in \nPakistan (November 2002) and the Access to Justice program in Pakistan (December 2001).\u201dSee also \nADB(2001;2002a,b,c;2003a,b) \n  10", "3. Measurement of Poverty: Some Fundamental Issues \n \n \nThere is by now a vast literature on measurement of poverty. Theoretically, the seminal paper \nwas Sen\u2019s 1976 axiomatization and the associated index that attempted to bring together the \nheadcount ratio the income gap ratio and income inequalities among the poor within a \nconsistent axiomatic framework. Since then, Sen and others following him have moved in the \ndirection of a multidimensional approach to poverty as inadequate capabilities. However, for \nthe purposes of this paper, I will keep within the income poverty concept where a single \nscalar, money income, is the only relevant variable of interest in measuring poverty and \ncomputing the various indexes. \n \n  The general intuition behind poverty measurement is that \u2018poverty\u2019 exists when a \ngroup of people in a particular society can not attain a \u2018minimum\u2019 level of well-being. The \n\u2018minimum\u2019 is at least partly dependent upon the prevailing standards of society. However, \nthere are dimensions of well-being such as nutritional requirements that might actually \nconstitute an absolute biological minimum. The idea behind absolute as opposed to relative \npoverty is that by using generally agreed upon minimum standards of well-being, we can, in \nfact, define an income poverty line. Such income poverty line gives the cut-off point below \nwhich everyone is deemed to be poor. The key questions in applying this idea of poverty for \napplied policy issues are: \n \n1.  How do we assess well-being? \n2.  How do we decide on a certain poverty line so that when a poor person crosses \nthat threshold s/he is no longer poor? \n \nThese are the questions which ask us to identify who the poor are. Therefore, this can be \ncalled, using Sen\u2019s terminology, the \u201cidentification\u201d of poverty. As a second step, the total \npicture of poverty is arrived at by aggregating. Hence, Sen\u2019s coinage of the term \u201caggregation \nproblem\u201d. Head count ratio is one obvious example in which one simply counts the number of \npeople below the poverty line and then divides this number by the total number of individuals \nin a particular society.  \n \n  In terms of identifying the poor through the setting of the poverty line, a number of \nissues can arise. The following four questions are one way of raising some these issues \n(Fields 2001): \n \n1.  Is the basis income or consumption, and how comprehensively will either one be \nmeasured? \n2.   What is the income-receiving unit: individual, family, per capita, or adult \nequivalent? \n3.  Will there be a single poverty line or will there be separate ones for urban and \nrural areas or different regions of the country? \n4.   Is the poverty line income determined scientifically, politically, subjectively, or as \na matter of convenience? \n \nIn terms of both identification and aggregation of poverty, the procedure depends partly on \naxiomatizing the concept of poverty so that any particular measure has a number of desirable \nproperties. The most common axioms are focus, anonymity, population homogeneity, \nmonotonicity or strong monotonicity, and distributional sensitivity. Among the commonly used \nindexes, the head count ratio fails both the strong monotonicity and distributional sensitivity \naxioms. \n \n  Since Sen's (1976) axiomatic treatment of poverty comparisons several new indexes of \npoverty have emerged. Among them is the one developed by Foster, Greer and Thorbecke \n  11", "(FGT).  \n \n  The FGT index which we will meet later again as the index used most frequently in \nthe macroeconomic models incorporating poverty analysis has many desirable properties. In \naddition to satisfying the monotonicity and distributional sensitivity axioms, it also has the \nproperty of being additively sub-group decomposable. This means that the index is \ndecomposable by subgroups (according to region, income class etc.) among the poor.  \n \n  Thus this index can take into account the intensity of poverty for different groups of \npoor people. This is done by looking at the deprivation of calories. The poverty measure is given \nby: \n \n \n \n                 p  = 1/n \u03a3 (G / z)a \nj\n \n \nwhere    n = total population \n    q = the number of poor \n    z = the poverty line \n    G = food expenditure shortfall of the jth individual (j = 1,2,\u2026,q ) \nj\n \nIn the simulation a value of a = 2 is used. At a lower value of \u2018a\u2019 some of the axioms are violated. \nAt a higher value of \u2018a\u2019 the shortfalls of the poorer segments are weighted more heavily; \ntherefore the intensity of deprivation by the poorer segments (in particular the poorest) will be \nmagnified for value of \u2018a\u2019 greater than 2. For this value of `a\u2019 both the monotonicity and transfer \naxioms of Sen are satisfied. We may recall that both these axioms have to do with the sensitivity \nof the index to the incomes of the poor as opposed to simply the number of poor. Thus, the \nmonotonicity axiom states that, ceteris paribus, a decrease in the income of a poor person \nshould increase the poverty index. The transfer axiom states that, ceteris paribus, a transfer of \nincome from a lower income poor person to a higher income poor person increases the poverty \nindex. It can be checked easily that this is true for the FGT index when a = 2. \n  12", "4. Macroeconomic Models for Developing Economies: Some Characteristics \nRelated to Dualism in South Asia \n \n \n   \nIt is well known that the developing economies have special features that need to be \nrecognized. Below, I first discuss some of these aspects of developing economies from the \nmacroeconomic modelling perspective that will be relevant for.formulating a \u201cgeneric\u201d model \nfor South Asia. Later in this section, a brief discussion of some \u201cmicro\u201d institutional features \nthat are also relevant for poverty reduction strategies in South Asia in particular, are \nmentioned in order to round out the discussion. From the macroeconomic side, the following \npoints are important9: \n \n1)  First, there must be an accounting framework and behavioral equations capturing \nsome key aspects of macroeconomic modelling for developing countries. The \nmost straightforward way of giving economic content to a set of aggregate \naccounting relationships is by adding appropriate behavioral equations and \nequilibrium conditions. \n \n2)  The accounting relationships that are relevant for a particular case depend on the \nstructure of the economy. There could, for example, be a) \u201cbenchmark\u201d \naccounting framework; b) particular features, modelling aspects such as \nalternative choices of disaggregation of production and consumption, structural \nfeatures of labor market, degree of development of the financial system etc.  c) \nbehavioral functions, liquidity constraints on aggregate consumption; credit and \nforeign exchange rationing, debt overhang and its effects on production and \nprivate investment uncertainty and irreversibility effects on investment decisions; \neffects of financial repression, currency substitution, and informal financial \nmarkets on money demand etc. \n \n3)  Fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in developing countries are important \nfeatures in most models.  Data must cover a wide range of variables including \nindustrial output, prices, wages, various monetary aggregates, domestic private \nsector credit, fiscal variables, exchange rates and trade variables. \n \n4)  Nature and implications of fiscal rigidities and the effect of fiscal deficits on a \nvariety of macroeconomic variables are also important. \n \n5)  Developing country fiscal problems require special attention. Some of the most \nimportant features here are:  high tax rates levied on a narrow tax base and \nheavy reliance on revenues from financial repression and multiple currency \npractices, on the inflation tax, and on excessive debt financing. \n \n6)  Exchange rates modelling require special attention as well. In particular, one \nneeds to identify special features such as \u201cfixed\u201d with rationing and simultaneous \ntransactions in parallel markets when these are present.  Credibility and inflation \nunder a fixed exchange rate regime also need particular attention. The \nassociation of quasi-fixed exchange rates with currency and financial crises \nmakes this issue specially significant. Contractionary effects of devaluation may \nalso destabilize the economy, and could be included as a theoretical possibility \nthat may sometimes become a practical problem. \n \n                                                  \n9 See also, Agenor and Montiel (1999), Thorbecke and Morrison(1989), Khan(1983,1996,1997), Khan and \nSogabe(1994), Khan and Sonko(1994) Khan and Thorbecke(1988),and Fields(2001). \n  13", "7)  The role of labor markets in the context of short-run macroeconomic adjustment in \ndeveloping countries is particularly important for analyzing the poverty reduction \nimplications of macroeconomic policies. More specifically, labor market \nsegmentation and sectoral wage rigidity need special attention. \n \n8)  It should also be recognized that by now there are both orthodox and \u201cheterodox\u201d \nprograms and models of structural adjustment in developing economies.  \nAlternative models of inflationary process are also available. However, the \napproach I have adopted here is intended to skirt unnecessary terminological \n(and at times, ideological) controversy. This \u2018ecumenical approach\u2019--- to use \nSherman Robinson\u2019s felicitous term--- adopted here is more concerned with the \nreal contents of the models and their real world policy relevance. \n \n9)  Macroeconomic dynamics associated with monetary and exchange rate policy \nrules in a context where international capital mobility is imperfect need to be \nemphasized. \n \n10) Three important issues that models must focus on in the context of exchange-rate \nbased disinflation programs in developing economies are: i) output, ii) interest \nrates, iii) real wages. \n \n11) It should be pointed out that with humility that none of the modelling approaches \nthat are widely used in developing countries is at present able to adequately \naddress the complex dynamic interactions between stabilization, growth and \ndistribution. This makes the intermediate and longer-term analysis of issues \nrelated to external debt, capital inflows, and currency crises particularly difficult. \n \n  Trade and financial liberalization and macroeconomic performance likewise \nbecome issues where the dynamic aspects are often treated simplistically. \nProblems of short-run macroeconomic management during the liberalization \nprocess are also well known and need little commentary. \n \n12) Political factors in the adoption and abandonment of stabilization and structural \nadjustment programs in developing countries effects are also of obvious \nimportance, but are very difficult to incorporate in the standard macroeconomic \nmodels of applied general equilibrium variety. For example, it would obviously be \nimportant to include the effects of the presidential and parliamentary electoral \ncycle on the pattern of public spending in many Asian and Latin American \ncountries. One could also make the same case for including an analytical \nframework for examining the linkage between exchange rate policy and electoral \ncycles. \n \nSome questions that are relevant rise in light of the features discussed above are: \n \na.  What structural changes need to be preceded by macroeconomic stabilization? Or, \nalternatively, can the two proceed concurrently? \n \nb.  What is the proper sequencing of the liberalization and reform measures ? \n \nc.  What \u201cstructural\u201d differences between developed and developing economies, and \n\u201cstructural\u201d similarities among the latter. Are relevant to model? \n \nIn response to the third question above, the following shared structural characteristics may \nbe important: \n \n  14", "1)  Many agents possess significant market power \n \n2)  Macroeconomic causality in developing countries tends to run from \u201cinjections\u201d \nsuch as investment, exports, and government spending to \u201cleakages\u201d, such is \nimports and saving; \n \n3)  Money is often endogenous \n \n4)  The structure of the financial systems can influence macroeconomic outcomes in \nimportant ways \n \n5)  The role of imported intermediate and capital goods as well as direct \ncomplementarity between public and private investment are empirically important. \n \nPartly as a consequence of these features some have questioned the wisdom and efficiency \nof orthodox short-run macroeconomic policy prescriptions, particularly \u201cshock treatment\u201d in \nthe form of fiscal austerity coupled with devaluation and tight monetary policy. \n \n  Disagreements among modelers also exist with respect to the identification of the \nsource of inflation. The key controversy is about whether one should ascribe an \naccommodative rather than a causal role to money supply growth. According to the \nnonmonetarist view frequently the source of inflation is slow relative productivity growth in \nagriculture (arising from poor land distribution and land tenure patterns) combined with \nadministered prices (arising from noncompetitive market procedures and implying downward \nprice rigidities) in industry, together with wage indexation. Monetary policy is perceived to be \npassive in the face of these already pervasive inflationary forces.  Moreover, in part because \nof the roles of working capital and imported inputs, and in part because substitution \npossibilities are more limited than assumed by the proponents of orthodox macroeconomic \nmanagement, a policy package combining devaluation with tight fiscal and monetary policies \nwill result in stagflation in the short-run with little or no improvement in the external accounts.  \nThe alternative new structuralist policy prescription is not always clear, but it would in all \nlikelihood contain a greater element of gradualism, direct intervention, and employ many of  \nthe means of medium term resolution of  structural problems that are contained in traditional \nstabilization programs. \n \n  For the sake of parsimonious modelling, quite often a three good modelling \napproach is adopted. The three aggregated goods are non-traded domestic good, exportable \ngood, and importable good.10 Here, too, some important differences between the developed \nand developing countries need to be kept in mind. For example, \n \n1)  Developing economics, like small industrial countries, tend to be much more open \nto trade in goods and services than are the major industrial countries. In 1995 \ntrade share of developing countries was 45% compared to G-7s trade share of 25 \npercent. \n \n2)  Developing countries typically have little control over the prices of goods they \nexport and import. In particular, they often face exogenous terms of trade. \n \n3)  Over half of the exports typically consist of agricultural and primary commodities. \nSuch an export structure needs to be modeled explicitly. The Mundell-Fleming \nmodel which has long been the work-horse of open economy industrial country \n                                                  \n10 Later in the case of the \u201cdual-dual\u201d approach to modelling, we will find basically the same classification scheme. \nHowever, the number of production sectors in the particular model discussed in section 7 is four. The reasons will \nbe explained in section 7. \n  15", "model, assumes endogenous terms of trade determination, with the domestic \neconomy completely specialized in the production of a good over which it exerts \nsignificant market power. The production structure most suitable for the analysis \nof developing country macroeconomic phenomena is instead likely to be the \nSalter-Swan dependent economic model or (as mentioned before) a three good \nmodel consisting of exportables, importables, and nontraded goods. \n \nSuch a production structure permits a distinction to be drawn between the exogenous terms \nof trade and an endogenous real exchange rate, which is the central intertemporal \nmacroeconomic relative price in these economies. \n \n  In terms of the exogenous prices faced by the typical developing economy, both oil \nand non-oil commodities prices fluctuate a great deal.   \nThe extent of external trade in assets have tended to be more limited in developing countries \nthan in developed countries although this situation has recently begun to change in dramatic \nfashion for an important group of developing economies. The resulting instabilities however \nhave also caused serious dislocations. In particular the increase in poverty in the affected \nAsian economies after the Asian Financial Crisis from July 1997 on should be kept. \n \n  In particular, the macroeconomic consequences of pegging, of altering the peg \n(typically devaluation) and of the rules for moving the peg are of particular importance in \nmacro-modelling in developing countries. It is also useful to remind ourselves in trying to \nmodel the financial sectors that financial markets in many developing countries have long \nbeen characterized by the prevalence of rudimentary financial institutions. This is of particular \nrelevance in analyzing the impact of policies on poverty reduction in low-income countries.  \n \n  In light of the above, it should be apparent that in the modelling of these economies \nsome macro-behavioral relationships may need to be modified. For example, we may need \nto incorporate the implications of credit and foreign exchange rationing in private decision \nrules where such rationing is present.  This will affect, for instance, private consumption, \ninvestment, asset demand, export supply and import demand functions.  \n \n \nSome Relevant Aspects of Public Sector Behavior  \n \nThe Government Budget is another important segment of a macro-model requiring careful \nhandling. In particular, we need to remember that the composition of the government budget \ndiffers markedly between industrial and developing countries.Even though reduction of \ngovernment expenditures and the omnipresence of state has been on the agenda of the IFIs \nand national policy makers for at least two decades, there are still some lingering features. \nPerhaps the state is no longer as much of a behemoth as in the past. Nevertheless, a \nprominent role of the state in many developing economies is reflected through the following \nfactors, among others:  \n \na.  nonfinancial public sector \u2013 central government, local governments, specialized \nagencies, and nonfinancial public enterprises; \n \nb.  financial institutions owned by the government; \n \nc.  the central government absorbs a smaller fraction of output of developed \ncountries than in developing countries; \n \nd.  the composition of spending differs between the two groups of countries. \nDeveloping countries spend proportionately more of their budget on general \npublic service, defense, education and other economic services.  Developed \n  16", "countries spend more on health and substantially more on social security. \n \ne.  Revenue:  tax collection is hindered by limited administrative capacity and \npolitical constraints. This means that direct taxation plays a much more limited \nrole than in developed countries.  Direct taxes, taxes on domestic goods and \nservices, and taxes on foreign trade account for roughly equal shares of total tax \nrevenue in developing countries; in industrial countries income taxes account for \nthe largest shares and taxes on foreign trade are negligible.  In developing \ncountries, the share of tax revenue raised from individuals is much higher than \ncorporate income tax. \n \nf.  greater reliance on seigniorage (change in base money stock divided by nominal \nGDP).  Seigniorage and inflation are positively related.  \n \n \nThree other dimensions of the budget institutions that have relevance for both growth and \npoverty reduction have been much discussed recently: \n \ni.  The nature and credibility effects of the constitutional rules that can be \nimplemented to impose constraints on the size of the fiscal deficit, e.g., the \nbalanced budget rule  \n \nii.  The procedural rules that guide the articulation and elaboration of the budget by \nthe executive branch, its approval by the legislative branch, and its execution. \n \niii.  The type of rules (whether collegial or hierarchical) that may enhance the \ntransparency of the budgetary process e.g., Debt/ GDP upper limit constraint. \n \n \nAggregate Supply and Labor Markets: some further issues \n \nAggregate supply and the labor market are aspects that need some further attention before \nwe close our discussion of institutional and macroeconomic aspects of macro-modelling. \nHere it is important to point out that through the cost of intermediate inputs that are imported; \nthe exchange rate has an important influence on the position of the economy\u2019s short-run \nsupply curve (SRSC). \n \n  SRSCs in developing countries may be significantly affected by working capital \nconsiderations.  Many have claimed that costs of working capital tend to give interest rates \nand credit availability an important short-run supply-side role, although this is controversial \nand the empirical evidence is mixed.11  \n \n  Although labor market institutions vary substantially across developing countries, the \ninformal sector continues to play an important role in the determination of wages and \nemployment in many of them.  The modelling of short-run wage-setting behaviour \nrepresents one of the key differences between some of the major schools of modern \nmacroeconomics, but most participants in the disputes acknowledge that country-specific \ninstitutional differences (such as the prevalence of staggered overlapping contracts in the \nU.S. or synchronized wage bargaining in Scandinavia) are important in determining the \neconomy\u2019s SRSC.  In this context, the role of economy-wide backward indexation \n                                                  \n11 See Agenor, Pierre-Richard and Peter J. Montiel, Development Macroeconomics and the references there   \nfor evidence on the empirical importance of the costs of financing working capital in Argentina and Korea \nrespectively.  If empirically relevant, the role of working capital in the short run supply curve would imply, for \ninstance, that contractionary monetary policy may have short-term stagflationary consequences. \n  17", "mechanism in the context of disinflation programs has been studied extensively. Developing \ncountries, as is well known, often have disguised unemployment. What is less well known is \nthe prevalence of flexibility in many of the developing country labor markets as well. It would \nappear from the available evidence that many developing country labor markets have a high \ndegree of real wage flexibility (Horton et al., 1994). Thus, for proper modelling of these \nmarkets in developing economies, a properly nuanced mix of flexibility and rigidity in specific \nlabor markets is called for, rather than following one specific characterization for all labor \nmarkets. \n \n  As a result of the foregoing, the macroeconomic environment in developing \ncountries is often much more volatile than that in industrial countries.  The fundamental \ncauses of the macroeconomic instability in developing countries are both external and \ninternal.  Small developing countries are price takers in the international markets for goods \nand services as well as financial assets.  Therefore, these countries are directly affected by \nvolatility in international markets. If we add to this the inflexibility and paucity of domestic \nmacroeconomic instruments and we then face get a situation that is not easily amenable to \ncontrol.  There is also political instability in many countries resulting in frequent jumps in \npolicy regimes.  Such regime switch in a weak institutional environment creates the \nunfortunately typical developing countries scenario of a macroeconomic trajectory \npunctuated by a series of crises.  \n \n  To sum up, economic boom and bust are much more prevalent in developing \ncountries than developed countries.  Such a history of macroeconomic volatility has serious \neconomic costs-sometimes reaching into double-digit percentage points (See Khan, 2004b).   \n \n  The above discussion is intended to give a fair summary of what is special about \ndevelopment macroeconomics.  However, in order to link poverty analysis to the \nmacromodels, more explicit recognition of the nature of market imperfections and of informal \ninstitutions that arise to fill the gaps is necessary.  The literature in this area has \nexperienced a tremendous explosion drawing on advanced work in game theory and the \neconomics of information.12  These new approaches try to explain empirical institutional \nfeatures that include the following (Mookherjee and Ray, 2001). \n \n1)  Fragmented credit markets; \n \n2)  Segmented labor markets; \n \n3)  Lack of market clearing manifested in unemployment and credit rationing; \n \n \n4)  Co-presence of different types of contracts, e.g., tenancy contracts of both fixed \nrent and share cropping varieties; \n \n5)  Pervasive long-term relationships between borrowers and lenders, employers, \nand employees, or farmers and traders; \n \n6)  Dual labor markets in which some workers enter into long-term contracts while \nothers are employed to carry out similar task without such contracts at a lower \nlevel of wages; \n \n                                                  \n12 See for example, the papers collected in D. Mookherjee and D. Ray, Readings in the Theory of Economic \nDevelopment, Oxford:  Basil Blackwell, 2001, for a representative sample.  See also, P. Bardhan and C. Udry.  \nDevelopment Microeconomics, Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1999, Hayami, Development Economics (1997) \nand Otsuka(2001,2000). \n  18", "7)  Interlinked transactions and exclusive dealing between specific groups of agents \nacross many markets for instance, credit and tenancy may be bundled together.  \nLikewise, credit may also be bundled with employment or marketing contracts; \n \n8)  Asset ownership is the key to access to credit, tenancy or employment markets.  \nThus the poor have limited or no access to credit because they lack collateral \nassets.  The poor also have limited or no access to employment owing to \nmalnutrition, debilitating diseases or low levels of human capital. \n \n9)  Small farms show higher yields even when the large farms have better access to \ncredit and technology. \n \n10) Some markets such as the market for land sales are quite thin, leading to the \npersistence of tenancy and unequal land ownership in spite of the superior \nproductivity of owner cultivated small farms. \n \n11) Informal cooperatives and kinship networks are significant determinants of access \nto credit, insurance, technological information, water and common lands. \n \nAs Stiglitz (1994) and others have pointed out, the standard Arrow-Debreu model with a \ncomplete set of markets and optimizing agents cannot explain these phenomena.  However, \nmodels using game theory and the approach of information economics largely pioneered by \nStiglitz have amassed an impressive analytical record in explaining these features.  While \nmacromodels cannot be expected to accommodate all these features, in detail, at least the \nlabor and credit markets need to be modeled carefully.  This point is beginning to be \nrecognized by development macroeconomists of virtually all persuasions (Agenor and \nMontiel, 1999). \n \n  In South Asia in particular many of these features which are distortions of the \nstandard neoclassical general equilibrium model are still observed. One objective of reforms \nhas been to give these economies more of a market orientation to varying degrees. The \nIndian case is illustrative. I turn next to a brief discussion of the post-1991 reforms in India \nwith particular attention to reforms in the  area of international trade. \n \n \n5.  An Example of Economic Reform in South Asia:India 1991-2004 \n \n \nFor its May 4, 1991 issue, the Economist chose the image of a tiger in a cage for the cover of \nan in-depth survey of the Indian economy.13 The Indian economy was indeed in deep trouble. \nThere were both short run problems of stabilization related in particular to problems of \nexternal balance and lack of reserves, and medium and long term issues of structural \nreforms including trade and financial liberalization. \n \nIn 1991, after the balance of payments crisis hit India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, a professional \neconomist and an economic administrator, was appointed Finance Minister. Manmohan \nSingh is undoubtedly the architect of the most far reaching reforms in India since \nindependence in 1947. Despite initial resistance, his personal integrity was a big factor in the \neventual acceptance of some major policy shifts. However, from the mid-90s, there was \nincreased criticism of both the  results of the reforms---particularly on the distributional \nside--- and their inadequate formulation(Virmani 2004). In response, government economists \n                                                  \n13 I am grateful to Amartya Sen for drawing my attention to this. See also, Dreze and Sen(2002) chapter 9, \u201cWell \nBeyond Liberalization\u201d for a deep and insightful assessment and suggestions for the future course of the Indian \neconomy. \n  19", "such as Dr. Arvind Virmani took upon themselves the task of clarifying the goals, objectives \nand methods of the reform package. \n \nAcoording to these Indian economists, there were two main objectives. One was to promote \ncompetition by eliminating protection. The other was to \u201c\u2026simultaneously\u201d increase  \u201c\u2026 the \nability of producers to meet such competition by removing policy barriers and distortions.\u201d14 \nClearly, trade liberalization was and remains an important plank of these reforms. \n \nAlthough 1991 is convevtionally given as the year when big changes began, the reform \nprocess itself was begun in the 80s.15 However, the emergency in 1991 led to both a painful \nstabilization package to handle the short run external balance problems and also to the \nlonger term reform agenda of dismantling the \u2018licence raj\u2019, giving market forces a bigger role \nto play. \n \nFocusing on trade liberalization in particular, a considerable increase in exports took place \nwith tariff reduction and removal of other barriers. Prior to the reforms all imports were either \nsubmitted to licensing or prohibited altogether. All bulk items such as cereals, petroleum, \nmineral ores, metals, fertilizers etc. could be imported only by specified government agencies. \nHence the market structure was close to being a monopsony. There was also a massive \nincrease in tariff rates in the 1980s. \n \nAs Joshi and Little(2001,pp64-65) argue forcefully, there were not good reasons for \nthe level of protection that the inefficient manufacturing sector had enjoyed historically. As \nthey also note, the really significant change on the import side was the introduction of a \n\u2018negative\u2019list. Any item not on the list could be imported freely except for some bulk items still \ncontrolled by the government agencies in mid-90s. \n \nIn accordance with trade theory the import of consumer goods in line with consumer \npreferences should enhance welfare. The long standing official Indian attitude towards \nforeign made consumer goods seems to have reversed itself. After making the people to \nsuffe through many homemade goods of lower quality produced inefficiently, the trade policy \nliberalization has led to an increase of imported consumption goods. \n \nOn the export side, quantitative export restrictions came under attack. The list of \nrestricted items has indeed shrunk as a result. Export promotion schemes are also being \npursued with more than usual vigor. However, many export promotion schemes still carry \nlarge administrative costs are quite complex in practice. \n \nIndia\u2019s main success in trade reform has been in the area of tariffs. In 1990-91, the \nunweighted average tariff was 125 per cent. That figure came down to 71 percent in 1993-94. \nThe peak tariff rate in 1990 was an unbelievably high 355 percent. The peak rate in 1993-94 \ncame down to 85 per cent. In 1995 the highest rate of tariff was further reduced to 50 percent. \nToday the average tariff rate is only 18 percent with the peak rate below 30 per cent. For this \nreason, in the policy experiments that follow in section 7, I concentrate on exploring the effect \nof tariff reduction on poverty reduction.  \n    \nOne last observation relates to the elections of 2004 and the replacement of the BJP \ngovernment with the Centrist government headed by Dr. Manmohan Singh and supported--- \nwith occasional criticisms--- by the left from outside the government. Initially there were great \nfears in the financial markets that a more populist regime will undermine the reforms if not \nreverse them altogether. That fear was calmed when Manmohan Singh became the prime \n                                                  \n14 Virmani(2004), p. 17. \n15 See Virmani(2004). Dr. Kurian of the National Institute of Public Finance made some particularly  insightful \nobservations regarding the continuity of social objectives such as poverty reduction, and the moderation and \nrelatively nonideological stance of leaders such as Manmohan Singh in particular. \n  20", "minister with Mr. Chidambaram as  the finance minister. However, the government has \nhonestly admitted the failure of reforms to benefit the poor and the ruaral sectors in general. \nAlong with the continuation of reasonable reforms, the government seems to be sincerely \ncommitted to the goal of poverty reduction.16 \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                  \n16 At least this is the consensus position I heard frequently from government advisers in the ministry of finance, \nplanning commission members, private think tanks, university professors and political leaders during my visit to \nIndia in July 2004. \n  21", "6.Towards A Generic CGE Model for South Asian Trade Liberalization  \n \n6.1: What is the \u201cappropriate\u201d class of CGE models for dualistic economies? \n \nIn order to discuss how to incorporate poverty analysis in a CGE model, we need a clear \nunderstanding of the structure of CGE models as such. As a first step in understanding the \nCGE models, we can start with the Walrasian \u201cfundamentalist\u201d approach to general \nequilibrium. Essentially, the problem here is to find a set of prices (a price vector) that will \nclear all markets.17 \n \nThe producers maximize profit and the consumers maximize utility. All markets \nincluding futures markets must exist and all uncertainty must be subject to actuarial \ncalculation of risk18. It is clear that while theoretically elegant and analytically impressive, the \nconditions in many actual economies do not approximate this theoretical model. \n \nIn the Keynesian type macroeconomic models at any rate, there can also be \nunderemployment equilibrium. There is thus a tension between such macroeconomic \nmodels and the Walrasian general equilibrium models where full price flexibility ensures full \nemployment at market clearing wage level. \n \nAs Robinson (2003) observes: \n \nThe literature on CGE models is replete with debates about the macro \nproperties of these models, and a number of different schools of thought have \nemerged concerning how, or indeed whether, one should incorporate macro \nfeatures into these SAM-based models. No clear consensus has emerged, \nwhich is hardly surprising since the debate really concerns the theoretical \ndividing line between Walras and Keynes, and the micro foundations of macro \nmodels--- or the lack thereof. (p. 1) \n \n \nIt is not relevant here to outline the contours of this debate, except to keep in mind that \nneither the fully Walrasian nor the standard Keynesian model is likely to correspond exactly \nto the actualities of a developing economy.  However, we need to keep firmly in mind that \na CGE model in its origin--- and initial historical development--- is Walrasian in spirit. \n \n  At the applied level, a CGE model incorporates all the flow variables that can be \ncaptured in a SAM. 19 The origins of social accounting can be traced as far back as Gregory \nKing\u2019s efforts in 1681, but more recent work stems from the attempts by Richard Stone, \nGraham Pyatt, Erik Thorkbecke and others. 20 The relkevant SAM accounts must be \nspecified clearly for the particular CGE model one wishes to construct and implement. \n \nThese accounts will usually include production activities, factorial income distribution and \nhousehold income distribution among other variables. The importance of both the factorial \n                                                  \n17 Actually, it is necessary and sufficient for all but one of the markets to be in equilibrium. As is well known, by \n\u201cWalras\u2019  law\u201d when all  but one markets clear, the last one must clear also. \n18 Formally, the maximization of expected utility must be possible. For this, an axiomatic characterization was \ngiven by von Neumann and Morgenstern. A necessary condition is the possibility of expressing all states as \nquantifiable probability distributions.  \n19 For a succinct discussion of some of the relevant features of the applied models for policy analysis, see Yao, \nShujie and Aying Liu, \u201cPolicy Analysis in a General Equilibrium Framework\u201d Journal of Policy Modelling, \n22(5):589-610, 2000. \n20 For a description of SAM as a data gathering device, see G. Pyatt and E. Thorbecke, Planning Techniques for \na Better Future (Geneva:  ILO, 1976). See also Khan(1983,1997,1998,2004b) and, Khan and \nThorbecke(1988,1989). \n  22", "income distribution and household income distribution for poverty analysis in a CGE model \nare intuitively obvious. However, proper modelling strategy for these distributions in a CGE \nmodel is far from obvious. Later, we will have an occasion to deal with the issues that arise in \nthis context in some concrete examples of CGE models for poverty analysis, and finally to \nformulate an appropriate model for South Asia incorporating the dualistic structure of South \nAsian economies. \n \nAs implied before, the Walrasian spirit of a CGE model is shown in its determination \nof only relative prices, with some price index being chosen as the numeraire. The model \nalso incorporates the assumption of \u2018no money illusion\u2019--- all supply and demand equations \nare homogeneous of degree zero with respect to prices.21 If all prices are multiplied by a \nfixed number, the equilibrium quantities do not change at all. \n \n  As a matter of historical record, it has been a standard practice of CGE modelling to \nspecify fixed supplies of factors of production such as various types of labor and capital, or \naggregate indexes of these, and carry through the implications of the assumption that all \nmarkets must clear. These \u201cclassical\u201d CGE models calibrate wage and rental rates to employ \nall of the exogenously specified labor and capital. In many \u201capplications\u201d, the guiding idea \nhas been to introduce distortions to the \u2018equilibrium price vector\u2019 and calculate the resulting \ninefficiencies. In this sense, CGE models have been used as a normative check for \ndistortions and their costs against the benchmark of a Walrasian market clearing price \nsystem.22 \n \n  There is also much discussion in the CGE modelling literature about the various \n\u201cclosure rules\u201d for the models. The discussion about macro-closures, initiated by Sen (1963), \nwas revived by Taylor and Lysy (1979) who found that the choice of macro-closure to a large \nextent affected the policy simulation results obtained with a CGE model. As the previous \ndiscussion already indicates, the macroeconomic modelling is forced to depart from the \nWalrasian assumptions embodied in a \u201cfundamentalist\u201d CGE model. This also leads to the \n\u201cclosure rule problem\u201d. Because the short-run macro CGE models do often deviate from the \nWalrasian closure, a separate literature has grown up around the various alternatives.  \n \n  There are mainly two ways to interpret and define the closure rule problem. In \nmathematical terms, the problem boils down to the simple notion that the model should \nconsist of an equal number of equations and endogenous variables.23 Thus, the closure rule \nproblem is the decision the model builder has to make on which variables are endogenous \nand which variables are exogenous. Alternatively, if the model is built in the Walrasian \ntradition and all decisions are based on optimizing behavior, the closure rule problem \ninvolves the introduction of macroeconomic constraints that impinge upon the microeconomic \nbehavior of individual agents. One then needs to introduce additional balancing equations. \n(Ginsburgh and Keyzer, 1997). In general, a closure rule is determined by the theoretical \npreferences of the model builder and, in her view, empirically the most plausible adjustment \nprocesses. \n \n  In the early works that used CGE models for development policy work, much time \nwas spent in finding ways to model the various distortions in the foreign trade sectors. Thus, \nmodelling exports, imports, balance of trade and balance of payments became important \nitems on the modelling agenda during the 1980s. After trying various approaches, a general \nconsensus was reached. The consensus approach admits imperfect substitutability between \n                                                  \n21 In macroeconomic terms, we can include the assumption of neutrality of money. And thus create a \u2018classical\u2019 \nmodel. \n22 It should be noted, however, that the assumption of full employment means that the economy is at the wrong \npoint of the (multidimensional) production possibilities frontier, not inside it. \n23 More precisely, the system must satisfy solvability conditions. For a linear system this means that the number \nof linearly independent equations must equal the number of endogenous variables. \n  23", "imported goods and their domestic counterparts. The Armington assumption is invoked by \nalmost all modelers.24 The Armington assumption regarding imperfect substitutability has \nbeen extended to the modelling of exports as well. The most common approach now is to \nspecify sectoral constant elasticity of substitution(CES) import demand functions, export \ntransformation functions that assume constant elasticity of transformation(CET) and \naggregation functions based on these.25 \n \n  We may recall that starting with Hume and his price-specie flow mechanism, the \nclassically inspired trade theories have implied a trade balance of zero in equilibrium. But in \nthe real world data the trade balance is rarely zero. Does this mean that the equilibrium \nassumption is somehow violated? The most widely practiced way of handling this nonzero \ntrade balance is to make it exogenous. Typically, trade imbalances find their counterpart in \nthe saving-investment imbalance. \n \n  Looked at in this way, trade imbalances can be treated as foreign saving flowing in \nwith a trade deficit, and of savings flowing abroad when trade balance is positive. However, \nthis does raise the question of why people at home or abroad would be willing to save and \nlend--- a question that can only be answered in an explicitly intertemporal model. Thus, static \nCGE models which treat trade balance as exogenous are, in fact, compressions at a point in \ntime of a more fully specified intertemporal equilibrium model. \n \n  There is also the related issue of how to bring in balance the traded with the \nnontraded sector, and the domestic economy with the rest of the world. This is done by \nmaking flexible another relative price. This is the relative price of traded and nontraded goods, \nor under the purchasing power parity and small country assumption, the real exchange rate. \nNaturally, modelers tend to specify an implicit functional relationship between the real \nexchange rate and the trade balance. Increased flow of foreign savings raises the relative \nprice of nontraded goods which is equivalent to an appreciation of the real exchange rate in \nthese models (Devarajan, Lewis and Robinson, 1993). There is a shift of production away \nfrom exports goods producing sectors to nontraded goods and services. Consumers shift \ndemand to cheaper imports and the new trade balance equals the exogenous flow of higher \nforeign savings.26 \n \n  This is perhaps a good place to shift our attention from foreign savings to domestic \nsavings and investment, with the role of the government as a key macroeconomic entity.  In \na flow description of the economy via the SAM accounts the savings-investment account \ncollects savings and spends money on investment goods. The flow equilibrium condition is \nthat savings must equal investment. Some mechanism is clearly needed to achieve this \nbalance, as our previous discussion of the closure rules already indicated. \n \n  The common strategy here is to specify savings parameters by household types. \nThese fixed parameters map income to savings. A fairly common (neoclassical) assumption \nis also to assume that all savings are spent on investment. Thus under this closure rule there \nis no \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d. Either through loanable funds markets or a more direct allocation \nrule( this is often the case), savings are translated into investment. However, this is not the \nonly way to relate savings and investment, and even here, as the reference to the loanable \nfunds markets hints, the full specification of a \u2018savings-driven\u2019 model on the financial side is \noften missing. Important questions regarding the saving-investment links need to be raised. \nThese include: why save at all ?  Why spend on investment rather than on consumption? \nWho owns the new capital stock? Do actors have and care about an asset portfolio? \nIntroduction of proper dynamics is necessary to answer these and other similar questions. \n                                                  \n24 See Armington(1969). \n25 The theoretically inclined reader will recognize this as being in line with the Salter-Swan model. \n26 Therefore, this is properly described as a comparative statics exercise with the chain of causality starting with \nthe exogenous change in foreign savings and ending with a new trade balance. \n  24", " \n  The question of private savings is also related to that of public savings and \ndissavings, as the case may be. But the government does more than simply generating \nsavings or dissavings. It collects taxes, makes transfer payments and purchases goods and \nservices. Through all these activities it can affect the flow of income and consumption of all or \nat least some socioeconomic groups. Hence, an intuitive link between government\u2019s actions \nand poverty is justified. Later, we will see how this link can be made more explicit in a causal \nsense. For the moment, let us simply observe that in most CGE models government is a \nrules-based (but not necessarily a utility maximizing) actor. Typically, the monetary side is \nabsent or sketchy. Usually, there is a flow-of-funds specification, but no consideration of how \nthe government finances its deficit. There is simply a crowding out of private investment. \n \n  Thus, the trade balance, private saving-investment balance and the public sector \nbalance are all treated in a somewhat ad hoc fashion, but in a way this treatment broadly \nrespects the relative price flexibility in the Walrasian spirit. However, the previous discussion \nalso raises the question of including dynamic considerations explicitly. In particular asset \nendowments, markets and expectational dynamics may need to be included. Opening up the \nmodel in this way, also carries the danger of making it less tractable. This explains why \ndynamic CGE models to this day are not as well developed as a reasonable theoretical \ncritique would demand. It would seem reasonable, for example, to expect that an \n\u201cecumenical\u201d approach could postulate the possibility of unemployment, informal labor \nmarkets, financial markets for various assets and their relation to the real sectors. Such a \n\u201crealistic\u201d model could better capture the location and dynamics of poverty among other \nthings. Better policy analysis prospects may be an important motivation for searching for \nsuch models. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper. What can not be ignored in an \nexercise in poverty analysis even if it is technically limited to comparative statics is the \ndistributional side I now turn to a consideration of distribution within CGE models leading \ntowards the formulation of an appropriate model for South Asia. \n \n  25", " \n6.2 Income Distribution, poverty and dualism: \n \nThe seminal contribution by Adelman and Robinson(1979) had used an implicit SAM to \ncapture both factorial and household income distribution in a disaggregated manner. At about \nthe same time the work of Lysy and Taylor(1980) focused on Brazil and made distributional \naspects a part of the overall analysis. Dervis, De Melo and Robinson(1982) also addressed \ndistributional issues in the general equilibrium modelling context. However, real concern with \ndistribution and poverty analysis started towards the end of 1980s, after a decade of \nstructural adjustment policies. Under the aegis of the OECD, Thorbecke (1991) for Indonesia, \nde Janvry, Sadoulet and Fargeix( 1991) for Ecuador, Morrison(1991) for Morocco and Chia, \nWahba and Whalley for the Ivory Coast are some modelling examples from this \u201csecond \ngeneration\u201d of CGE models for developing countries that addressed  income distribution and \nwelfare issues in greater detail than before.A number of papers by Bourguignon and others \nalso contributed to this stream.27 \n \n  We can summarize the main analytical developments in modelling distribution upto \nthis point by noting that these first and second generation models relied on a representative \nhousehold assumption and fixed distributional coefficients for the household income \ndistribution. Therefore, the analysis of poor households was necessarily coarse. No \ninformation about intra representative household income distribution and poverty was sought \nor used. The multiplier decomposition models of Thorbecke and Jung(1996) for poverty \nanalysis in Indonesia and Khan(1999) for South Africa also share this weakness.  \n \n  However, by utilizing the information in household income and expenditure surveys, \nit is now possible to generate intrahousehold groups income distribution and poverty profiles. \nIt is also possible to use these profiles as part of the initial calibrating exercise in CGE \nmodels. A set of recent modelling efforts have been directed in precisely this direction.28 \nHere, the paper by Decaluw\u00e9, Bernard, A. Patry, Luc Savard, and Erik Thorbecke (1999) is a \npioneering piece. Another paper by Decaluw\u00e9, Dumont and Savard (1999)  tests the \nrelevance of intrahousehold distributional information for poverty analysis. Based on an \narchetypal economy with four areas of activity (agriculture, industry, marketable and \nnonmarketable services), three factors of production (capital, skilled and unskilled labor) and \nfour types of agents(rest of the world, government, firms and households), their approach is \nto isolate the contribution of average income variations, poverty line changes, and income \ndistributional changes and then to look at the effect of these variations on various poverty \nindicators. Their results are unambiguous. They clearly highlight the relevance and \nsignificance of intrahousehold group information. Of the three influences they discuss, the \nchanges in poverty line in a price-endogenous model accounts for most of the changes in \npoverty. Therefore, both intra-household group information and price endogeneity that allows \nus to compute a new nominal poverty line after each policy change are important.

Results from the \u201cDual-Dual\u201d CGE Model and their Interpretation :Poverty \nAnalysis in a Generic CGE Model for South Asia \n \n \n \n  Among the models mentioned in the previous section, the closest to being a generic \nmodel is the Stifel-Thorbecke (2003) model of an archetype African economy. They build a \nCGE model in order to simulate the welfare effects of trade liberalization. In particular, their \neffort is directed towards an analysis of the effects of trade liberalization on poverty. They use \nwhat can be called a \u201cdual-dual\u201d frame work (Thorbecke,1993,1994,1997). This corresponds \nto the characteristics of a  developing economy with not only the traditional and modern \nsectors but also a kind of dualism within each of these sectors in terms of formal/informal \ndichotomy.30 Furthermore, the process of development for economies at a higher level of \ndevelopment may modify the traditional sector further in the direction of a more \nmarket-based modern sector. \n \n  Briefly, the coexistence and distribution of modern and informal type of activities in \nboth rural and urban areas are taken as basic structural features of the economy in question. \nAccording to the authors their modelling approach integrates poverty analysis with CGE \nproper \u201c\u2026 by endogenizing both intra-group income distributions and the nominal poverty \nline\u201d. Following this line of work leads to their being able to assess policy repercussions on \nboth poverty specific to particular socioeconomic groups and on overall national poverty. \n \n  The starting point is the dual economy models of Lewis(1954) and Fei and Ranis \n(1964)31. These pioneering efforts, however, could not or did not take into account the \nco-presence of dualism within each sector of the two sector models of the dual economy. Erik \nThorbecke first raised this issue in 1979 during the course of a National Science Foundation \ninterdisciplinary project on technology and development and Svejnar and Thorbecke (1982) \nwas the first published work on a prototypical of dual-dual technology classification scheme. \nKhan (1982a,b) and Khan(1983) were applications of this scheme to the energy and textiles \nsectors in South Korea. Khan (1983)  raised the issue of linking technological dualism to \npoverty theoretically, following an early observation of Pyatt and Thorbecke (1976). Khan and \nThorbecke(1988,1989) were further applications of technological dualism to Indonesia.  \n \n  In Thorbecke\u2019s later classification a rural/urban dichotomy is combined with \ntraditional/modern technological dualism, leading to a fourfold classificatory scheme.32 The \nfour broadly defined sectors in this scheme are: \n1.  subsistence agriculture with traditional labor-intensive technologies, family farms \nand food crops for domestic consumption; \n \n2.  large scale agriculture producing mostly export crops using capital-intensive \ntechnology. \n \n3.  the urban informal sector defined in an operational manner; \n \n4.  modern sector with industry and services in the urban areas. \n \n                                                  \n30 See also, Svejnar and Thorbecke (1980,1982), Khan(1983,1985,1997). In these analyses, the particular \ncountry chosen was South Korea in the 1970s. Instead of CGE flex-price models, SAM-based models of fixed \nprice variety were used. \n31 See Khan (1997) chs. 2 and 3 for a historical survey and a specific intertemporal dualistic model which is used \nto analyze the conflict between employment and output. \n32 See Svejnar-Thorbecke(1980,1982) and Khan(1983) for early developments. \n  28", "Poverty analysis in this dual-dual model proceeds along the lines developed by Decaluw\u00e9, \nBernard, A. Patry, Luc Savard, and Erik Thorbecke (1999). This approach relies on varying \nprices and a fixed commodity basket to derive an endogenous (nominal) poverty line every \ntime there is a shock resulting in a new equilibrium price vector for the economy. It also uses \na beta distribution with varying parameters to capture differences in income distributions that \nare group specific. Within each group also the parameters can vary, resulting in a new \ndistribution. Standard poverty measures are applied to pre-policy shock and post-policy \nshock income distributions to derive the impact on poverty. I have modified the model on the \nproduction side by replacing the Cobb-Douglas production functions of the Stifel-Thorbecke \nmodel with more general CES production functions. The trade liberalization policies\u2019 impact \non poverty reduction are given for this new, CES specification in this paper.As is well known, \non the production side, the latter specification allows a choice from a much wider range of \nelasticities than does the Cobb-Douglas production function. On the distribution side, \nCobb-Douglas production functions with the unitary elasticity of substitution imply fixed factor \nshares. Thus CES functions( of Cobb-Douglas production functions is a special case) allow \nmore flexibility on both the production and the distribution sides.Of course, the actual \nelasticities of sectoral production functions are empirical issues. But for this reason in \nparticular, Cobb-Douglas production functions with the unitary elasticity of substitution may \nbe a priori too restrictive.

Thus, capital, K, in each sector has an upper bound denoted by a bar above K. \nThe assumption that capital stock is fixed in each sector may be relaxed, but it is in fact, a \nfairly standard assumption for developing economies. \n                                                  \n33 Stifel-Thorbecke paper uses Cobb-Douglas production functions with elasticities of substitution restricted to a \nvalue of 1. \n  31", " \n  In the informal sectors each worker receives her average revenue product. Rural \nsmall holders may work on common land and these rural farming households may share the \ntotal income equally among all the family members. Urban informal workers supply all their \nlabor at the prevailing wage rate. Thus leisure is not an argument in their objective function. \nThis may be defended as an extreme assumption when people are at the margins of \nsubsistence. Equations 5 and 6 show the informal sectors\u2019 income determination. \n \n  The total income per unit includes logically the returns also to nonlabor assets for \nthose who own land or capital. Hence, the relevant measure of income is total income per \nunit from all sources. \nThe profit maximizing rural large landholders ensure that under competitive conditions wages \nfor unskilled workers in the export sector are equal to the marginal revenue product of the \nunskilled labor they have to hire. Equation 7 reflects this condition. \n \nEquation 8 shows the equilibrium allocation of unskilled labor in the rural informal \nsector. In equilibrium, the rural sector wage rate is below the wage rate in the formal sector \nby a fixed factor. This reflects the assumption  that there are transactions costs in working in \nthe rural formal sector that is captured by this mark up.34 \n                                                  \n34 Alternatively, one could also postulate that there is an \u2018insider\u2019 market wage equilibrium in the formal sector, \nand those unskilled workers lucky enough ( or more likely, because they know someone already working in the \nformal sector) to get a job in the formal sector  \ncan enjoy this wage premium.

Here, in equilibrium, rural wage must equal the expected wage in the urban \nsector. In equation 12, the probability of getting a job in the import sector is given by the \nshare of the urban uneducated labor force in that particular sector multiplied by a scale \nparameter, h. \n \n  Skilled workers are employed only in the formal sectors. Their wages are \ndetermined in equations 13 and 14 by their marginal revenue products. We now turn to the \ndetermination of incomes for the households. \n \n \nHousehold Income Determination: \n \nThere are nine types of households. Two in the rural area are landowning households--- \nlarge and small. There are also urban capitalists and bureaucrats. The other five are \nhouseholds where the main source of income is from labor. \n \nThe rural informal households which are really rural small holders receive their total \nrevenue from production as shown in equation 16. Rural unskilled and skilled households \nreceive their wage incomes as shown in equations 17 and 18 respectively. Equation 19 gives \nthe incomes of the rural large land holders. \n \nEquations 20- 24 show the incomes of the urban households. The working class \nhouseholds receive wage income and the capitalists the profit incomes, in general. The \nbureaucratic households capture part of the rents from imports by colluding with the rent \nseekers.35 \nThe formal sector employers (rural large land owners and urban capitalists) are the only \nsavers in the model. They each save a constant fraction of their nominal incomes. \n \nHousehold demand functions are captured by maximization of Cobb-Douglas utility \nfunctions subject to their income constraints. There are 23 such equations (equations 27-49) \nbecause the four rural household groups have access to only food and importables. This \ngives us eight equations. Each of the urban groups has access to three commodities--- food, \nimportables and urban services. This gives another 15 equations. The prices for the three \ncommodities can be used to define an overall deflator. \n \nForeign Trade: \n \nImports in this model are the difference between domestic demand and production of import \ncompeting sector. Exports can be supplied at the prevailing price up to any quantity under \nthe small country assumption. Thus exports are equal to total output less the savings in the \nform of exportables of the rural large landholders. Equations 50 and 51 show the import and \nexport demand functions respectively. \n \n \nEquilibrium conditions for the model as a whole: \n                                                  \n35 Salaries are excluded in equation 24. The reasoning is that these are invariant to exogenous shocks. \n  33", " \nThere are two sets of equilibrium conditions in the model. First, the labor market equilibrium \nconditions are given by equations 52 and 53. There is disguised unemployment, as \ndiscussed before, but no formal involuntary unemployment. The second set of equilibrium \nconditions given by equations 50 and 51 is that the domestic demand for the informal sector \ngoods and services is matched by domestic supply. Prices in the formal sectors are set by \nthe world market prices The export price is normalized to one. The import price is equal to \n1+t, where t is the tariff rate . Exchange rate is held fixed during the particular modelling \nperiod. It is clear that the current account balance must be exogenous. In line with our \ndiscussion in the previous section, this balance is equal to foreign savings which are \nassumed to be zero here. Hence current account balance is assumed to be zero.36 The SAM \nbelow in table 1 which is largely compiled from data for India below summarizes the relevant \ninformation for our generic South Asian economy. Note that in the SAM, the labor and capital \nare shown in aggregate forms; but in actual modeling exercise these are further \ndisaggregated as discussed during the model description above.37 \n                                                  \n36 Implicitly, this amounts to claiming for a reforming economy(see section 5 above) that the stabilization policies \nindeed succeed in restoring the external balance. \n37 Namely, skilled and unskilled labor, and capital and agricultural capital. \n  34", "Table 1: SAM for a generic dual-dual South Asian Economy                                 \n \nRural     \n Import   Rural   Rural  Large   Urban   Urban  Urban      Pub. \nCompeti  Urban  Small  Unskill  Rural  Landh Informa Unskill Skille Capitali Bureau  Priv.

The sources of income poverty can be traced \nto the sources of income of the various households. Table 2 below gives the factorial sources \nof household incomes of poor households in the model economy. The numbers are \nhypothetical and are the same as Stifel- Thorbecke\u2019s specifications.  \n \nTABLE 2: FACTORIAL SOURCE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME (%) \n  Unskilled labor  Skilled labor  Capital  Agricultural  Total \ncapital \nRural small    75.0        25.0   \nholders  100.0 \nRural unskilled   100.0         \n100.0 \nRural skilled     100.0       \n100.0 \nRural large         100.0   \nholders  100.0 \nUrban informal    75.0       25.0     \n100.0 \nUrban unskilled   100.0         \n100.0 \nUrban skilled     100.0       \n100.0 \nUrban capitalists       100.0     \n100.0 \n \n \n \nAmong all the household groups, rural smallholders have the second lowest average income \nand they have the second highest incidence of poverty. The highest incidence of poverty is \nfound among the urban informal households. As table 2 shows they derive 75 percent of their \nincome from wages in the unskilled labor market and 25 per cent from capital. \n \n  Table 3 below shows the initial mean incomes and population shares before the \npolicy experiment. This has been created by taking the demographic and other \ncharacteristics of households in South Asia---particularly in India and Bangladesh. This table \nalso shows the headcount measure of poverty rates for each of the household groups that \nearn at least some labor income. It ignores three household groups, however. The groups \nthus ignored are rural large landholders, urban capitalists and bureaucrats. The reason is \nsimple. None of these households are assumed to be in poverty, nor does the particular \npolicy shock results in poverty for any of these three groups. \n \n  36", "TABLE 3: INITIAL INCOME AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF HOUSEHOLDS \nIN THE LABOR MARKET \n  Mean income  Population share  Percent poor \nRural small-holders                1.00          0.41      90.20 \nRural unskilled   1.05          0.01      20.57 \nRural skilled  1.75          0.01      21.18 \nUrban informal                0.92          0.38      74.71 \nUrban unskilled                1.95          0.05        5.34 \nUrban skilled                3.50          0.09        1.49 \n \nFrom table 3 above, it appears that the mean incomes have a wide range----from 0.92 for the \nurban informal workers to 3.50 for the urban skilled workers. These incomes are scaled \nrelative to the pre-tariff import price which is the numeraire in the model. Among the skilled \ngroups, the richest are in the urban sector. For the unskilled also, the urban unskilled group \nhas the highest income, for reasons explained previously. Rural smallholders (41 per cent of \nthe population) and other households with low education and skills such as rural unskilled, \nurban informal and urban unskilled comprise about 80% of the total population and almost all \nof the poor come from these groups. Contrarily, households comprising of highly educated \nand skilled workers account for about 10 per cent of the total population and only 0.4% of \nthose below the poverty line come from these groups. \n \n  For an adequate analysis of the policy impact on poverty one needs not just the \ninformation about the composition of households and their mean incomes, but also on the \nintragroup income distributions. As mentioned before, the statistical distribution function \nchosen to fit the various degrees of mean, variance, skewness and other features is the Beta \nDistribution. This choice allows a certain flexibility. The density functions can be either \nsymmetric or asymmetric. They can also be skewed to the left or to the right. Of course, the \nchoice of parameters that will result in a particular shape of the distribution function can not \nbe arbitrary, but really should be guided by the actual shapes, or some information regarding \nthese shapes, of the distribution functions for each particular group of households. Here, \nwell-designed and accurate household surveys can lead to a much improved policy analysis. \nIn this particular exercise, the assumption of within group distributional neutrality after the \npolicy shock is maintained. Therefore, the impact on poverty comes from mainly the growth \neffects of the policy. A second, significant feature, however, is the urban-rural migration after \nthe policy shock. This also affects the poverty reduction possibilities of liberalization, as we \nwill see shortly. \n \n \nPolicy Simulation in the Model and Impact on Poverty: \n \n \n  Prior to the policy experiment of tariff liberalization, the urban skilled workers in the \nmodel economy enjoy the highest level of wages. Their average wages are exactly twice the \nlevel of the rural skilled, almost three times that of the urban unskilled and more than three \ntimes that of the other three groups. \n \n  The trade policy experiment involves a tariff reduction that ranges from 87% to  \nbelow 20%.38 The obvious and immediate effect is a drop in the price of imports and a \nrelative increase in the price of exports.39 In keeping with the shape of the supply curves \n                                                  \n38 This reflects approximately, the actual Indian policy changes and the consequent trajectory of tariffs. See Joshi \nand Little(2004(1996)), Virmani(2004) and Ahluwalia and Little(1998). A \u2018generic\u2019 set of experiments in tariff \nreductions starting with an index of 100 and going down to 0 in steps of 10 per cent reductions is given in the \nappendix. \n39 The nominal price of exports which is the numeraire remains constant. \n  37", "production rises for exports and falls for the import-competing sector.40Consistent with this, \ndemand for both skilled and unskilled labor drops in the urban importables sector, and rises \nin the rural exportables sector. There is also a fall in the wages in the former sector, and a \nreverse migration out of this sector in the urban area to the export sector in the rural area. \nFor this particular policy experiment, in the new general equilibrium, the share of urban \nskilled workers falls by 9%. At the same time the share of rural skilled workers rises by about \n22%.Correspondingly, there is also a movement of the unskilled workers from the urban to \nthe rural area as well. Finally, the fall in the aggregate income in the urban formal sector \nreduces effective demand for the urban services sector as well, pushing out the urban \ninformal sector workers towards the rural area also. \n \n  Table 4 below gives the results for poverty reduction. Two implicit assumptions \nunderlie these results. First, individuals who migrate take on the socio-economic \ncharacteristics of the group in which they end up. Second, both the groups---i.e., the group \nfrom which the individual migrates and the group to which the individual worker migrates--- \nstill have the same income distribution as before the migration. \n                                                  \n40 The exact extent will naturally vary with the extent of relative price changes and the supply elasticities. \n  38", "TABLE 4: CHANGES IN POVERTY \n Base     \nCase  Sim_87_  Sim_20_  Sim_15_ \n  TX_87   20  Change  18   Change  12   Change \nNational Poverty               \nPoverty Headcount (P0)  24.56  24.417  -0.56%  24.08  -1.39%  24.42  0.00% \nPoverty Gap (P1)  5.60  5.607  0.18%  5.55  -1.11%  5.60  -0.02% \nPoverty Severity (P2)  2.09  2.092  0.14%  2.07  -1.00%  2.09  0.00% \n               \nPoverty Headcount (P0)               \nRural Small-Holders  90.20  90.204  0.00%  89.39  -0.90%  90.20  0.00% \nRural Unskilled  20.57  20.566  0.00%  19.87  -3.40%  20.57  0.00% \nRural Skilled  21.18  21.178  0.00%  20.82  -1.70%  21.18  0.00% \nRural Capitalist  -  0    -    -   \nUrban Informal  74.71  74.014  -0.93%  74.01  0.00%  74.01  0.00% \nUrban Unskilled  5.34  4.577  -14.29%  3.81  -16.67%  4.58  0.00% \nUrban Skilled  1.49  1.49  0.00%  1.49  0.00%  1.49  0.00% \nUrban Capitalist  -  0    -    -   \n               \nPoverty Gap (P1)               \nRural Small-Holders  26.91  26.961  0.18%  26.72  -0.88%  26.91  -0.01% \nRural Unskilled  0.99  1.003  1.21%  0.94  -6.48%  0.99  -0.10% \nRural Skilled  1.93  1.947  0.83%  1.87  -4.21%  1.93  -0.05% \nRural Capitalist  -  0    -    -   \nUrban Informal  27.09  27.087  -0.02%  27.02  -0.26%  27.09  0.00% \nUrban Unskilled  0.16  0.158  0.00%  0.15  -3.80%  0.16  0.00% \nUrban Skilled  0.02  0.015  0.00%  0.01  -20.00%  0.02  0.00% \nUrban Capitalist  -  0    -    -   \n               \nPoverty Severity (P2)               \nRural Small-Holders  10.51  10.535  0.25%  10.41  -1.17%  10.51  -0.02% \nRural Unskilled  0.07  0.075  1.35%  0.07  -8.00%  0.07  0.00% \nRural Skilled  0.23  0.237  1.28%  0.22  -5.91%  0.23  0.00% \nRural Capitalist  -  0    -    -   \nUrban Informal  11.73  11.722  -0.03%  11.68  -0.39%  11.72  -0.01% \nUrban Unskilled  0.01  0.008  0.00%  0.01  -12.50%  0.01  0.00% \nUrban Skilled  -  0    -    -   \nUrban Capitalist  -  0    -    -   \n \nNote: Poverty measures are all multiplied by 100. \n  39", " \nUnder the assumptions, the results within the model show that in general, both the \nextent and depth of poverty decline for each group. The largest headcount ratio drop is \nrecorded for the rural unskilled group. Poverty severity also falls for each household group \nwith the exception of the urban unskilled workers. But when the tariff rates fall from 15 to 12 \npercent, this group benefits as well. In general though, much of the poverty reduction impact \nof trade liberalization can be reaped earlier. Further reductions leading to a rate below 10 per \ncent may not have much more of an impact than earlier tariff reductions. One surprise, \nhowever, is the largely nonlinear impact of tariff reductions on poverty. Although there is a \nprogressive gain from liberalization, there seems to be a big jump nationally when the rate is \nin the range of 15 to 18 per cent. However, there is very little change for even lower rates, for \nexample, from 15% to 12%.Given the stylized nature of the exercise, no magical properties \nneed to be attributed to these particular  numbers. The general lesson is that tariff reduction \nwill ultimately benefit the poor; but the trickling down process is uneven and may require \nsome time to work through the socio-economic system.   \n \n We look at the poverty gap squared measure next. From the results presented in \ntable 4, it turns out that tariff reduction does lead to a reduction in poverty severity at 18 per \ncent. However, the change in the national poverty measure is small--- a fall of only one per \ncent. This is consistent with the observation that trade liberalization may benefit initially those \namong the poor who are closer to the poverty line than those who are far below. It may leave \nunchanged the incomes of those who are well below the poverty line. But the good news \nsurely is that when tariffs are sufficiently low, some of the poorest may finally begin to benefit.  \n \n Scrutinizing table 4 carefully, it can be seen that for the various household groups \nthe headcount jump is relatively more significant for several of the rural household groups. In \nparticular, both the rural skilled and unskilled household groups experience significant \nchanges in poverty reduction at the lower tariff rates. For urban unskilled the changes are \neven larger absolutely  but are relatively less dramatic and more monotonic over an entire \nrange of gradually declining tariff schedules.. However, for the poverty gap measure, the \npoverty reduction effects shown are much smaller for this group. By contrast, the urban \nskilled household group via higher wages and better employment opportunities experiences \na further reduction of about 20% when tariff rates are reduced from 20 to 18 per cent. \nHowever, this group has fewer poor households to begin with. Hence, the overall impact on \nnational poverty reduction is small. \n \nIn terms of the change in poverty severity measure, the urban unskilled show the \ngreatest improvement. This group is followed by rural unskilled, rural skilled and rural \nsmallholders. Thus an overall average tariff rate reduction target all the way down to the \nrange of 10 to 20 per cent range seems a reasonable trade liberalization policy objective for \na South Asian economy from a poverty reduction perspective..  \n \n However, a cautionary note needs to be sounded so that there is a sense of realism \nabout the potential of trade liberalization alone to meet the overall poverty reduction targets. \nAlthough the positive effect on national poverty is clearly discernible within our model with the \nresults derived from South Asian data, the absolute amount is not as high as it would need to \nbe given the poverty reduction targets of the Millenium Development Goals, for instance. In \npart this is because of migrations taking place from both high paying to low paying and vice \nversa. The net effect is smaller than it would have been if only low paying to high paying job \nmigration were taking place. One needs a dynamic model to trace out these movements over \ntime and also to estimate the dynamic benefits of liberalization. This is an important future \ntask although beyond the scope of the present paper.41 \n                                                  \n41 For recent work on some of the dynamic connections via productivity increases see Alcala and Ciccone(2004) \nand the references therein. \n  40", "8. Conclusions and Prospects for Future Work on Asian Developing Economies \n \n \n.   In this paper, it has been argued that a generic CGE model for analyzing the poverty \nimpact of various economic reforms in South Asia can be built. As a first step, trade \nliberalization is taken as the specific policy experiment for examination.The specific generic \nmodel for South Asia incorporating dualism and rural-urban and urban-rural migration within \na Harris-Todaro framework reveals a number of specific features of the connections between \ntrade liberalization and poverty reduction. \n \n      Within this particular CGE model, the policy experiments show that in this region trade \nliberalization can lead to further poverty reduction. This is true at both the national level and \nat the level of the various household groups. This is indeed good news that conforms to the \ngeneral prediction of the standard comparative advantage based trade theory. \n \nHowever, the extent of poverty reduction impact of trade liberalization turns out to be \nlimited. There are several reasons for this. The main reason is that the Harris-Todaro \nmechanism allows reverse migration to lower paid jobs for the potentially unemployed as \nprotection is removed. Furthermore, the impact of further tariff reductions becomes \nattenuated for most groups when the tariff levels are lowered sufficiently. On the whole, the \nhigh tariff barriers should be dismantled, but beyond a certain point---say about 15 per cent \naverage tariff rate--- the further impacts become negligible. \n \nSeveral policy conclusions can be reached regarding poverty reduction strategies in \nSouth Asia in light of the findings here. Trade liberalization certainly does not conflict with \npoverty reduction and hence can be pursued without fearing adverse poverty impact. \nHowever, the approach may need to be a firm but gradual liberalization with special \nsensitivity to agriculture and the rural poor. It should also be kept in mind that trade \nliberalization can certainly help reduce poverty, but by itself it may not be the magic bullet \nagainst poverty. The actual poverty reduction impact in South Asia is most likely to remain \nsmall for this policy instrument. Hence other growth enhancing reforms need to be pursued \nsimultaneously. Targeted poverty reduction programs may also be needed with emphasis on \nincreasing the efficiency of targeting and improving their cost-effectiveness.Programs such \nas food-for\u2013work and other employment schemes,microfinance, agricultural credit etc. need \nto be pursued with a focus on making them more effective in terms of reaching the targeted \ngroups at minimum cost to the programs. Rural industrialization and increase in productivity \nthrough investment in social sectors and human capital also remain viable policy options. In \nterms of Sen\u2019s capabilities approach, the capabilities of the poor--- particularly their basic \nfunctionings--- need to be enhanced so that they can better participate in income earning \nactivities. \n \nTurning now to some methodological issues for future work,  there are at least four \ncategories of Asian economies--- broadly speaking--- that could be the subject of CGE \nmodeling exercises regarding the poverty reduction implications of trade liberalization. First, \nwe have low income countries of South Asia. Here, a model based on an economy such as \nIndia or Bangladesh could offer some insights. This is indeed what has been attempted here. \nThe second category would include middle income Asian Developing countries such as \nIndonesia. The third and fourth categories will include the transitional low and middle income \neconomies in Asia, for example, Viet Nam and PRC respectively.. As any student of the Asian \nDeveloping Economies  will quickly point out, the four categories are not exhaustive, but \nthey do cover a large number of country cases including the most populous poor countries \nwith a large number of poor people. \n \nAddressing all the structural and institutional issues even in each of the four \n  41", "categories is beyond the scope of this paper. However, as a beginning, the case of India has \nbeen studied here. In Asian economies such as India, the low level of income and pervasive \npoverty present a prima facie case for a policy focus on poverty reduction. However, there \nhas only been mixed success in poverty reduction so far. One reason is that over the past \nfew decades, the growth record has also been somewhat mixed. There have also been \nmacroeconomic imbalances in the form of high fiscal deficit, low domestic savings, and \nsizable external account deficit. Consequently, both inflation and interest rates were high, \nmaking the economic environment unfriendly to adequate and accelerated investment. In the \nwake of the policy focus on macroeconomic balancing, the growth and poverty impacts of \nsuch policies are natural candidates for rigorous investigation within the CGE tradition of \nmodeling. \n India is one of the \u2018big five\u2019 in Asia along with PRC, Bangladesh, Pakistan and \nIndonesia in terms of both population and poverty. These five Asian countries comprise three \nfifths of the world\u2019s population and two fifths of poor people. The next step may be to move to \nthe case of a middle income Asian country such as Thailand or Indonesia with large numbers \nof poor. \n It should be mentioned here that the modeling approach for the middle income \ncountries will need to be an \u201cextended\u201d dual-dual approach. Since these economies are more \ndiversified with relatively more developed financial sectors, the incorporation of these details \nmay take us well beyond the dual-dual model used here. For transitional economies a \ndifferent set of structural features may need to be considered. For example, the presence of \nstate owned enterprises and financial controls of various sorts will need to be modeled. \nThese are some fruitful directions for future research. \nFinally, one important methodological issue is the level of aggregation on the \nhousehold side. Clearly, the use of a fully disaggregated data set on the household side \nremoves the compulsion of using the always-somewhat-arbitrary classification of households \ninto various socio-economic groups. Although we are still dealing with a sample of \nhouseholds and not the entire population, it can be argued that this \u201cmicro\u201d picture is in some \nsense as accurate as we can get without enlarging the sample. When data are available, \nundertaking both group level and micro level poverty analysis can offer important \ninsights.Therefore, micro poverty analysis in macromodels is a desirable direction for \nresearch to follow. \n \n \nTo sum up, within a generic CGE model, the consequences of the trade liberalization \npart of the adjustment policies for allocation of resources, household income distribution of \nincome and impact on poverty has been examined here in a way similar to the dual-dual \napproach pioneered by Thorbecke and others. Beginning with a  solid understanding of the \ncausality of household income distribution, production structure, migration patterns and factor \nmarkets emphasizing both formal and informal sectors, the model  incorporates the \neconomy wide causality of income poverty in a transparent manner. Although the first stage \nof the modelling process has only aimed at comparative statics experiments, an eventual \ndynamic extension will clearly be desirable and possible.  The dynamic gains from \ntrade---with proper redistributive mechanisms--- could indeed lead to a more rapid poverty \nreduction than the comparative statics exercise would indicate. This remains an urgent task \nwithin the CGE framework of analysis for all Asian Developing Economies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  42", "   \nReferences: \nADB (2001) Special Evaluation Study on Program Lending, SST:STU2001-16, November. \nADB (2002a) Country Assistance Program Evaluation in Mongolia, CAP:MON 2002-12, \nOctober. \nADB (2002b) Program Performance and Audit Report on the Agriculture Sector Program in \nthe Socialist republic of Vietnam, PPA:VIE 25325, September. \nADB (2002c) Report of the Working Group on Poverty Impact Assessment of Projects, \nMarch. \nADB (2003a) Country Assistance Program Evaluation in the Philippines, CAP:PHI 2003-04, \nJanuary. \nADB (2003b) ADB (2003a) Country Assistance Program Evaluation in Bangladesh, CAP:BAN \n2003-03, January. \nAdelman I. and S.
