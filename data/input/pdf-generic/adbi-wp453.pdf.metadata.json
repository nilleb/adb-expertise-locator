INTRODUCTION \n\nthe  yuan,  as  an \n\nThere is a lot of talk about the potential role of the currency of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  (PRC), \ninternational  currency.  For  many  observers, \ninternationalization  is  the  yuan\u2019s  manifest  destiny  and  a  by-product  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nremarkable  economic  success.  Widespread  use  of  the  yuan  is  confidently  said  to  be \n\u201cinevitable\u201d  (e.g.,  Lee  2010;  Subramanian  2011).  The  yuan  has  embarked  on  a  Long \nMarch  towards  world  status,  reminiscent  of  the  historic  trek  in  the  1930s  that  was  so \npivotal in bringing the Chinese Communist Party to power in 1949. The only question, it \nseems, is how many years the Long March will take. \n\nIs  such  confidence  warranted?  Recent  history  has  seen  the  emergence  of  other \ncurrencies that, for a time, were also expected to soar to the top ranks of the \u201ccurrency \npyramid\u201d (see Cohen 1998, 2004). In the end, their trajectories leveled off well short of \nwhat  was  anticipated.  Limits  slowed  down  and  ultimately  stalled  the  process  of \ninternationalization.  Will  history  repeat  itself?  Or  will  the  yuan  prove  to  be  the \nexceptional currency that finally managed to keep ascending where others faltered? \n\nThe  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  see  what  lessons  may  be  drawn  from  these  earlier \nexperiences for the future internationalization of the yuan. Analysis will be limited to the \nperiod  since  World  War  II.  During  that  period  three  historical  antecedents  stand  out. \nThese are the deutsche mark (DM), the Japanese yen, and the euro (successor to the \nDM). Each seemed destined for greatness, only to fall short of expectations. Much can \nbe  learned  from  their  stories\u2014first,  about  what  may  drive  the  internationalization  of  a \ncurrency; and second, about what, ultimately, may set a limit to the process. \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, the three antecedents will be \nexamined in turn. In each case, analysis will address the economic and political factors \nthat influenced the eventual outcomes. The aim is to identify the key determinants that \nmight  be  thought  to  have  either  promoted  or  hindered  internationalization  over  time. \nWhat factors contributed to the international appeal of each currency, and what factors, \nin  the  end,  limited their competitiveness? The  penultimate  section  describes  the main \nlessons  suggested  by  these  cases  for  the  future  prospects  of  the  yuan.  The  final \nsection concludes. \n\n2.  HISTORICAL ANTECEDENTS \n\nIt  is  axiomatic  that  a  flourishing  world  economy  requires  some  kind  of  internationally \naccepted  money.  Without  this,  nations  would  be  reduced  to  crude  barter,  severely \ncurtailing gains from cross  border trade  or  investment.  In the  absence  of  a  true  world \ncurrency  backed  up  by  a  global  central  bank,  however,  participants  have  little  choice \nbut to rely instead on a limited selection of national currencies to play vital international \nroles.  At  any  given  time,  only  a  few  currencies  actually  gain  some  degree  of \nacceptance  for  use  across  borders.  The  conditions  for  successful  internationalization \nare  daunting,  limiting  the  sample  of  historical  antecedents  that  may  be  considered \nrelevant to the aspirations of the yuan today. \n\n2.1  Internationalization \n\nInternationalization  of  a  currency  involves  a  multiplicity  of  roles,  as  specialists  have \nlong recognized. There is, in fact, a standard taxonomy for characterizing the roles of \nan international currency, which separates out the three familiar functions of money\u2014\n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nmedium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value\u2014on two levels of analysis: the \nprivate  market  and  official  policy.  This  adds  up  to  six  roles  in  all.  Sources  generally \nspeak  of  the  separate  roles  of  an  international  currency  at  the  private  level  in  foreign \nexchange  trading  (medium  of  exchange),  trade  invoicing  and  settlement  (unit  of \naccount and medium of exchange), and financial markets (store of value). At the official \nlevel,  we  speak  of  a  currency\u2019s  role  as  an  exchange-rate  anchor  (unit  of  account), \nintervention  currency  (medium  of  exchange),  or  reserve  asset  (store  of  value). \nAlthough the six roles are interdependent to some extent, each is distinct in practical as \nwell as analytical terms. \n\nThe  scope  of  an  international  currency  is  defined  by  the  number  of  roles  it  plays.  Its \ndomain  is  defined  by  its  geographic  range.  At  any  given  time,  only  a  few  national \ncurrencies tend to  play  any  international  role  at all.  Even  fewer  play  all  six  roles,  and \neven fewer still are used on a truly global scale. Since World War II, the US dollar has \nclearly dominated in terms of both scope and domain. Its only close rival these days is \nthe euro, presently the second most important currency in the world, with Japan\u2019s yen a \nbit further behind. Other currencies are also used across borders\u2014such as the pound \nsterling,  Swiss  franc,  and  Canadian  and  Australian  dollars\u2014but  on  a  much  more \nmodest scale. These minor currencies can be found mainly in international banking or \nbond  markets,  or  to  a  limited  extent  in  central  bank  reserves.  The  yuan,  by  contrast, \nhas  gained  little  traction  outside  the  PRC.  Despite  current  talk  of  internationalization, \nthe yuan\u2019s role on the global stage has yet to be realized. \n\n2.2  Essential Qualities \n\nWhy  are  there  so  few  international  currencies?  At  the  national  level,  the  role  of  a \ncurrency can be promoted by the coercive powers of the state. Sovereign governments \ncan  deploy  legal  tender  laws  and  related  regulatory  measures  to  compel  residents  to \nadopt  the  national  currency  for  all  legitimate  monetary  purposes.  States  enjoy  a \nmonopoly  within  their  own  borders,  but  at  the  international  level  the  capacity  for \ncoercion  is  more  limited.  Monopoly  is  replaced  by  competition,  and  agents  must  be \npersuaded  rather  than  compelled  to  make  use  of  a  currency.  Competition  for  market \nshare  is  the  essence  of  the  process  of  internationalization.  A  new  entrant  must  have \nqualities that enhance its appeal relative to incumbents or other possible contenders. In \nshort, the currency must be competitive. \n\nWhat makes a currency competitive? Both economic and political factors are involved. \nOn the economic side, analysts agree that three broad attributes are essential. First, at \nleast  during  the  initial  stages  of  internationalization,  is  widespread  confidence  in  a \ncurrency\u2019s future value backed by financial stability in the country of origin. This means \na proven track record of relatively low and stable inflation is required. Second are the \nqualities  of  \u201cexchange  convenience\u201d  and  \u201ccapital  certainty\u201d\u2014a  high  degree  of \ntransactional liquidity and reasonable predictability of asset value. The key to both is a \nset  of  deep  and  well  developed  financial  markets,  sufficiently  open  to  ensure  some \ndegree  of  access  by  non-residents.  A  minimum  level  of  convertibility  for  foreign \ntransactions is obviously necessary if a currency is to be used internationally. And third, \na  currency  must  promise  a  broad  transactional  network,  since  nothing  enhances  a \ncurrency\u2019s  appeal  more  than  the  prospect  of  acceptability  by  others.  Historically,  this \nfactor  has  usually  meant  a  growing  economy  that  is  large  in  absolute  size  and  well \nintegrated  into  world  markets.  Without  at  least  some  of  these  essential  attributes,  no \ncurrency is likely to hold much appeal for international use. \n\nOn  the  political  side,  both  domestic  and  international  considerations  play  a  role. \nDomestically,  political  stability  and  effective  governance  in  the  country  of  origin  are \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\ncritical. Potential users are unlikely to be attracted to a currency that is not backed by \nadequate protection of property rights and genuine respect for the rule of law. Nor will \nthey  be  drawn  to  a  regime  that  lacks  a  demonstrated  capacity  for  successful  policy \nmanagement. \n\nInternationally,  the  experience  of  the  dollar  suggests  that  geopolitics  and  security \nconsiderations may also be of considerable importance. At the private level, a militarily \npowerful nation can provide a \u201csafe haven\u201d for nervous investors (James 2009; Norloff \n2010). A strong defense ensures a more secure investment climate. At the official level, \ncurrency  preferences  of  governments  may  be  influenced  by  broader  foreign-policy \nties\u2014traditional  patron\u2013client  linkages,  informal  security guarantees,  or formal  military \nalliances. Can it be an accident that with the conspicuous exception of the PRC, most \nof the big dollar holders around the world are all formal or informal allies of the United \nStates? The greater the ability of an issuing state to project power beyond its borders, \nthe more likely it is that others will feel comfortable using its money.  \n\n2.3  Candidates \n\nRealistically,  few  currencies  are  able  to  meet  all  these  demanding  economic  and \npolitical qualifications. Given the substantial stakes involved, the competition that is at \nthe heart of the process of internationalization is bound to be unforgiving. \n\nIn  some  cases,  currencies  are  effectively  disqualified  because  they  fail  to  perform  all \nthree  of  the  standard functions  of money. They are  not full-bodied  currencies. That  is \nespecially true of so-called \u201cartificial currency units\u201d like the special drawing right (SDR) \nof  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  or  Europe\u2019s  old  European  currency  unit \n(ECU), which have existed primarily as notional units of account. Neither the SDR nor \nthe ECU was ever available for use as a medium of exchange. The same was also true \nof the \u201ctransfer ruble\u201d created by the former Soviet Union for denominating trade within \nthe Soviet-led bloc of \u201csocialist\u201d nations before the end of the Cold War. Trade among \nbloc  members  was  based  on  strict  bilateral  balancing.  Monetary  values  were \nexpressed  in  transfer  rubles,  but  these  existed  solely  for  accounting  purposes.  Trade \nwith non-bloc members was done entirely in dollars or other Western currencies. The \nruble that was used inside the Soviet Union was tightly regulated and rarely adopted for \ntransactions abroad. Despite the Soviet Union\u2019s geopolitical importance at the time, its \nnational currency never had any real international standing. \n\nIn  other  cases,  currencies  are  disbarred  in  practical  terms  by  inconvertibility. \nTechnically, Article VIII of the Charter of the IMF imposes a convertibility obligation on \nall  IMF  members.  To  this  day,  however,  a  majority  of  the  IMF\u2019s  membership\u2014mostly \nthe least developed economies still take advantage of a legal loophole afforded by the \nCharter\u2019s Article XIV to prolong rigid exchange and capital controls. No one would ever \nconsider any of their currencies credible candidates for internationalization. \n\nInterestingly,  the  PRC,  too,  still  limits  the  convertibility  of  its  currency.  Even  among \nobservers  who  see  internationalization  as  the  yuan\u2019s  destiny,  a  natural  assumption  is \nthat a minimum level of convertibility for current and capital-account transactions must \ncome  first.  It  is  not  clear,  however,  whether  convertibility  must  be  absolute.  A  critical \nquestion  posed  by  the  yuan  is  how  much  convertibility  is  necessary  to  encourage \ninternational use. The answer, as we shall see, is not self-evident. \n\nAmong  convertible  currencies,  many  fail  to  appeal  internationally  because  they  lack \none  or  more  essential  attributes.  Some  issuing  countries  may  have  a  poor  record  on \ninflation  or  lack  sufficient  depth  and  liquidity  in  their  financial  markets.  Others  may \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nsimply  not  be  big  enough  to  offer  a  broad  transactional  network  or  project  power \neffectively. Others may lack the requisite political stability or rule of law.  \n\nIncumbency also matters. Currency choice is notoriously subject to inertia owing to the \noften  high  cost  of  switching  from  one  currency  to  another.  Why  go  to  the  trouble  of \nadapting  financial  practice  to  a  different  currency  unless  you  can  be  sure  that  others \nwill make use of it, too? A challenger must not only match at least some of the qualities \nof existing international currencies, it must also somehow offer advantages sufficient to \npersuade agents to risk making a potentially costly change. In practical terms, it is not \neasy  to  compete  with  a  currency  that  is  already  as  well  established  as  the  US  dollar \nhas  been  since  World  War  II.  The  US  dollar  enjoys  undoubted  incumbency \nadvantages.  Not  least  is  the  fact  that  the  language  of  its  issuing  country,  English, \nhappens  as  well  to  be  the  universal  language  of  international  business.  The  idea  of \nconverting  from  one  currency  to  another  is  less  appealing  if  it  also  means  switching \nfrom one language to another. \n\nIn  recent  experience,  the  currencies  that  have  managed  to  achieve  even  marginal \nacceptance  for  cross-border  purposes  are  few.  Since  World  War  II,  the  dollar  has \ndominated.  Among  all  other  currencies,  only  the  DM,  yen,  and  euro  have  for  a  time \nbeen competitive enough to also gain a significant share of the market for international \nmoney. Much can be learned from the stories of these three antecedents.  \n\n3.  THE DEUTSCHE MARK \n\nAt  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  picture  was  clear.  There  was  just  one  international \ncurrency of any consequence\u2014the dollar. Within the so-called sterling area the United \nKingdom\u2019s  pound  sterling,  under  heavy  restriction,  was  still  in  use  for  some  cross-\nborder  purposes  but  had  already  begun  a  long  decline  to  fringe  status  (Cohen  1971; \nSchenck  2010).  Ironically,  when  the  first  new  challenger  emerged  in  the  1960s  and \n1970s,  it  was  a  currency that  had  not  even  existed  in  1945\u2014the  deutsche  mark. The \nDM was created in 1948 as part of a major economic reform in the Western zones of \noccupied  Germany,  presaging  the  inauguration  a  year  later  of  the  new  Federal \nRepublic of Germany (otherwise known as West Germany). By the 1980s the DM was \nfirmly  established  as  the  second  most  important  currency  in  the  world,  before  being \nabsorbed  into  the  newborn  euro  in  1999.  Both  economic  and  political  considerations \nplayed pivotal roles in the story. \n\n3.1  History \n\nThe  Federal  Republic\u2019s  beginnings  were  not  auspicious.  Following  the  devastation  of \nwar,  the  country  lay  in  ruin  with  its  cities  and  industries  largely  destroyed.  But  then \nbegan  the  wirtschaftswunder\u2014Germany\u2019s  economic  miracle\u2014which  generated  rapid \ngrowth and persistent export surpluses. By the end of the 1950s the Federal Republic \ncould already be described as the leading economy on the European continent and the \nregion\u2019s pre-eminent monetary power. By the 1960s the DM\u2019s internationalization was \nwell  under  way.  By  the  1970s,  evidence  of  the  currency\u2019s  growing  prominence  was \nmanifest. Though never more than a distant second to the dollar, it was leagues ahead \nof all other currencies apart from Japan\u2019s yen. \n\nAt  the  private  level,  the  DM  quickly  emerged  as  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most  widely  used \ncurrencies for both foreign-exchange trading and trade invoicing and settlement. In the \nforeign-exchange  market,  a  currency\u2019s  share  in  total  transactions  indicates  its \nimportance  as  a  \u201cvehicle\u201d  for  trades  among  third  currencies.  Comprehensive  data  on \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nthe currency composition of such transactions in the global market were hard to come \nby  prior  to  a  series  of  triennial  surveys  conducted  by  the  Bank  for  International \nSettlements  (BIS)  beginning  in  1989.  Earlier  estimates  for  turnover  in  the  interbank \nmarket in New York, released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, put the DM \nshare of trades against the dollar in the range of 31\u201334% over the decade of the 1980s \n(Tavlas and Ozeki 1992). The BIS surveys suggest that globally, in 1989, the DM was \ninvolved on one side or the other of 27% of all currency trades\u2014far below the dollar\u2019s \nshare  of  90%,  but  well  above  that  of  any  other  currency  except  for  the  yen,  whose \nshare  as  a  vehicle  currency  was  comparable.  (Since  each  foreign  exchange \ntransaction has two sides, the total of shares adds up to 200%.) In 1998, just prior to \nthe birth of the euro, the DM\u2019s share of global currency transactions was up slightly to \n30% (BIS 1999).   \n\nSimilarly, by as early as 1980 the DM\u2019s share in the denomination of global trade was \nestimated at 13.6%, rising to 15.3% by 1992, some 40% greater than Germany\u2019s share \nof  total  world  exports  (Thygesen  et  al.  1995;  McCauley  1997).  Only  the  dollar,  with  a \nshare of global trade close to 50%, accounted for a larger proportion of invoicing.  \n\nThe  DM  also  gained  some  popularity  in  financial  markets.  Most  indicative  is  a \ncomposite index of the currency composition of international assets constructed at the \nBIS  for  the  years  1980\u20131995  (Frenkel  and  Goldstein  1999).  This  \u201cinternational  asset\u201d \naggregate  combined  holdings  of  bonds,  notes,  and  cross-border  banking  claims  for \npurposes of ready comparison. Over the period covered by the index, the DM attained \na  market  share  in  the  range  of  14\u201315%.  Again,  this  was  second  only  to  the  dollar, \nthough well below the dollar\u2019s share of half or more. \n\nAt the official level, Germany\u2019s currency was quickly adopted by a number of European \nneighbors  as  an  anchor  for  the  exchange  rates  of  their  own  currencies.  Stability \ncompared  to  the  DM  became  a  high  priority,  for  reasons  to  be  explained  below. \nCorrespondingly, Germany\u2019s currency also became the preferred intervention medium \nfor  neighboring  central  banks,  mostly  replacing  the  dollar.  According  to  one  informed \nsource  (Tavlas  1991),  the  DM  share  of  exchange-market  interventions  within  Europe \nrose from around 25\u201330% in 1979 to as much as 75% by the end of the 1980s. That \ndevelopment, in turn, encouraged accumulations of DM in reserves, also in preference \nto the dollar. Estimates culled from various issues of the IMF annual report suggest that \nGermany\u2019s currency came to account for 12\u201316% of global reserves during the 1980s \nand 1990s. \n\n3.2  Rise \n\nWhat explains the successful rise of the DM? The roots of its internationalization lay in \neconomics  but  were  reinforced  by  politics.  Two  economic  factors  in  particular  stood \nout. One was Germany\u2019s growing importance in world trade, which mainly affected the \nDM\u2019s role as a medium of exchange and unit of account for private market actors. The \nother  derived  from  Germany\u2019s  disproportionate  influence  on  general  macroeconomic \nconditions,  particularly  within  Europe,  which  mostly  affected  the  currency\u2019s  use  at  the \nofficial level. Both factors were amplified at the political level by the process of regional \nintegration  that  began  with  the  Coal  and  Steel  Community  in  1950  and  the  Rome \nTreaty of 1955\u2014what has since been known as the \u201cEuropean project.\u201d  \n\nTogether,  these  economic  and  political  considerations  promoted  a  broad,  albeit \nuneven, scope to the DM\u2019s internationalization. All six roles of an international currency \nwere  played  to  a  greater  or  lesser  extent.  In  terms  of  domain,  however,  the  DM  was \nquite  localized,  prevailing  mainly  around  Europe.  Elsewhere,  the  currency  was  less \ncompetitive. The DM\u2019s geographic range was regional, not global like the dollar\u2019s.  \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nAs  indicated,  a  broad  transactional  network,  reflecting  a  large  and  open  economy,  is \ngenerally considered essential to the internationalization of a currency. That proposition \ncertainly  seems  to  be  confirmed  by  the  German  case.  There  is  little  doubt  that  the \nincreased  use  of  the  DM  for  trade  invoicing  and  settlement  was  directly  linked  to  the \nFederal  Republic\u2019s  growing  importance  in  international  commerce,  both  as  exporter \nand importer. By the 1990s, Germany had become the world\u2019s second-largest trading \nnation, with a share of global trade (exports plus imports) of around 10%\u2014well behind \nthe  United  States  but  ahead  of  Japan.  On  the  selling  side,  Germany  ranked  as  the \nsecond-largest  exporter,  with  a  pronounced  comparative  advantage  in  differentiated \nmanufactured  goods  like  machinery  and  transport  equipment.  These  are  the  sort  of \nproducts  that,  among  advanced  economies,  typically  are  priced  in  the  seller\u2019s  own \ncurrency.  (The  major  exception  to  this  norm  was  Japan,  as  we  shall  see  below.) \nConversely,  on  the  buying  side  the  large  size  of  the  Federal  Republic\u2019s  domestic \nmarket  gave  German  importers  leverage  to  insist  on  denominating  trade  in  DM,  to \navoid exchange risk. On both sides, therefore, use of the DM was stimulated.  \n\nThe  effect,  however,  was  distinctly  regional  in  scale,  limited  primarily  to  the  Federal \nRepublic\u2019s immediate neighbors. In the broader global economy, Germany  was by no \nmeans  a  giant  among  nations\u2014only  about  one-fifth  the  size  of  the  US  market  and \nequal to no more than 60% of Japanese GDP. Its place in the world was substantial but \nhardly  overwhelming. Within  Europe,  however,  the  Federal  Republic  was  dominant\u2014\nabout  30%  larger  than  France  and  40%  larger  than  the  United  Kingdom.  In  its  own \nvicinity, Germany\u2019s large market was bound to exercise a strong gravitational pull.  \n\nIn turn, the regional bias was reinforced by the European project of integration. By the \n1980s  nearly  the  entire  continent  west  of  the  Iron  Curtain  was  drawn  together  by  a \nnetwork  of  trade  agreements,  reducing  or  eliminating  barriers  to  commerce  in  the \nregion.  Some  countries  were  full  members  of  the  so-called  common  market,  known \ntoday  as  the  European  Union  (EU).  Others  were  effectively  included  under  other \naccords.  Europe\u2019s  increasingly  close  commercial  ties  naturally  added  to the  weight of \nthe regional leader\u2019s currency. With barriers falling, intra-European trade could logically \nbe expected to grow faster than trade with countries elsewhere; and no economy was \nmore important within the region than the Federal Republic. As nearby countries grew \nincreasingly dependent on Germany, both as a market and a source of supply, it was \nonly natural that they would be prepared to do more business using the DM.  \n\nA  record  of  low  inflation  is  also  considered  essential  to  internationalization.  This \nproposition  seems  to  be  confirmed  by  the  German  case.  The  German  public  has  a \nwell-known aversion to inflation, dating back to the hyperinflation that swept the country \nafter World War I. A pronounced \u201cstability culture\u201d has long prevailed, fully reflected in \nthe  hardline  policies  of  the  Federal  Republic\u2019s  central  bank,  the  Bundesbank. \nThroughout  the  post-World  War  II  period,  Germany  consistently  ranked  among  the \nleast \nto  have  a \ndisproportionate  influence  on  general  macroeconomic  conditions  across  Western \nEurope,  given  the  Federal  Republic\u2019s  central  position  in  regional  import  and  export \nmarkets.  Neighboring  states  were  driven  to  keep  their  own  prices  in  line  in  order  to \navoid  a  loss  of  competitiveness  relative  to  Germany.  The  imperative  was  to  stop  real \nexchange rates (nominal exchange rates adjusted for inflation differentials) from rising.  \n\ninflationary  of  all  economies.  That  preference  was  bound \n\nThis meant that many European governments felt under pressure to match Germany\u2019s \nhigh interest rate as best they could. It may have been a bit of a caricature to suggest, \nas  some  observers  did,  that  the  Bundesbank  was  making  monetary  policy  for  all  of \nEurope\u2014a  simplification  that  came  to  be  known  as  the  \u201cGerman  dominance \nhypothesis.\u201d  Econometric  evidence  suggests  a  more  nuanced  picture,  where  interest \nrates  often  moved  in tandem  but  were  less than perfectly  correlated (Von  Hagen  and \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nFratianni  1990;  Laopodis  2001).  There  is  little  question  that  a  distinct  asymmetry \nprevailed looking very much like the sequential Stackelberg leadership model of game \ntheory,  with  the  Bundesbank  as  the  acknowledged  leader.  Other  central  banks  then \ndecided whether (or by how much) to follow German policy in response.  \n\nThe  same  imperative  also  explains  why  stability  in  relation  to  the  DM  became  a  high \npriority. Neighbors felt compelled to anchor their nominal exchange rates to the DM as \na kind of check to their own inflationary propensities. As one informed commentary put \nit  (Frenkel  and  Goldstein  1999:  720):  \u201cThe  gradual  hardening  of  exchange  rate \ncommitments\u2026  became  the  mechanism  by  which  previously  high-inflation  members \nchose to discipline their own monetary policies, and it was to the Bundesbank and its \nanti-inflationary  credibility  that  these  countries  turned  for  monetary  policy  leadership.\u201d \nBy  the  end  of  the  1980s  the  Bundesbank  (1988:  14)  was  boasting  that  the  DM \n\u201cperforms  the  function  of  a  key  currency,  acting  as  a  \u2018stability  anchor\u2019  for  the  other \npertinent currencies.\u201d \n\nIt was only natural, therefore, that most interventions in Europe would be carried out in \nGermany\u2019s  currency  and  that  a  larger  share  of  reserves  would  now  be  maintained  in \nDM. Here too, the impact was reinforced by the European project, which from the late \n1960s onward featured repeated attempts to promote some form of regional monetary \nintegration.  First,  in  1972,  came  the  so-called  \u201csnake,\u201d  a  mutual  intervention  system \naiming to link the currencies of Germany and its Common Market partners together in a \njoint  float.  When  that  experiment  proved  unsustainable,  agreement  was  reached  in \n1978 to launch a new European Monetary System (EMS), designed in effect to create \nan improved \u201csupersnake\u201d for Europe. At the heart of the EMS was the Exchange Rate \nMechanism (ERM), where in principle all interventions to sustain the joint float would be \nsymmetrical within a matrix of bilateral cross-rates. In practice, however, the ERM soon \nevolved  into  something  more  like  a  spoke-and-wheel  construct  with  Germany\u2019s \ncurrency  at  the  center\u2014a  DM  zone.  Studies  show  that  by  the  1980s  almost  all  of \nEurope\u2019s currencies were shadowing the DM to an extent (B\u00e9nassy-Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 and Deusy-\nFournier 1994; Frankel and Wei 1995). \n\n3.3  Limits \n\nYet for all its achievements, German\u2019s currency never came close to true global status. \nEven before its absorption into the euro, the DM had clearly reached its limit\u2014a distant \nsecond to the dollar. Four factors, both economic and political, explain why.  \n\nFirst  was  sheer  inertia,  reflecting  the  dollar\u2019s  undoubted  incumbency  advantages  in \nmost parts of the world. Outside Europe, the DM offered no significant gains relative to \nthe  dollar.  Only  within  the  European  neighborhood  was  Germany\u2019s  gravitational  pull \nsufficient to make the DM truly competitive. Elsewhere, the dollar retained its traditional \nedge.  \n\nSecond  was  the  inaccessibility  and  relative  backwardness  of  Germany\u2019s  financial \nmarkets,  as  compared  with  the  global  market  for  the  dollar.  Although  convertibility  of \nthe  DM  for  current  account  transactions  was  introduced  as  early  as  1958  (along  with \nmost other European currencies), a panoply of capital controls persisted until as late as \nthe  mid-1980s,  restricting  foreign  participation;  the  financial  system  could  hardly  be \ndescribed  as  open.  Moreover,  institutional  development  was  hindered  by  a  variety  of \ncomplex regulations and taxes. German bond and equity markets were notably thinner \nthan corresponding markets in New York or London, offering a limited range of financial \ninstruments. Accordingly, trading in DM-denominated claims was narrow and expenses \nwere high, hampering transactional liquidity. It was hardly surprising, therefore, that use \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nof the Federal Republic\u2019s currency as an investment medium, though not insignificant, \nwould lag considerably behind its other international roles.  \n\nThird  was  a  notable  reluctance  on  the  part  of the German government to  do  much to \npromote internationalization of the DM. Until the early 1980s the Bundesbank actively \nsought to restrict cross-border use\u2014for example, by exercising firm command over the \nissue  of  DM  obligations  in  the  external  bond  market  (Neumann  1986:  110).  At  issue \nwas control of monetary policy, so critical to Germany\u2019s anti-inflationary stability culture. \nPublic authorities feared that in time an undue constraint might be imposed on policy at \nhome  by  an  excessive  accumulation  of  liabilities  abroad\u2014an  apprehension  that  was \nwidely  shared  by  financial  interests  and  other  key  constituencies  across  German \nsociety  (Henning  1994).  Over  the  longer  term,  it  was  thought,  shifting  currency \npreferences could generate much exchange rate volatility and uncertainty, threatening \nboth  price  stability  and  export  revenues.  At  no  point  did  the  government  take  a  pro-\nactive stance on internationalization. If the DM was to emerge as a rival to the dollar, it \nwould have to do it on its own. \n\nFinally,  there  was  the  security  dimension.  The  Federal  Republic  may  have  been  a \nstable  democracy  with  full  respect  for  property  rights  and  an  earned  reputation  for \neffective policy management. However, it was also a divided nation on the front line of \nthe  Cold  War,  hardly  what  might  be  considered  a  safe  haven  for  investors.  For \nunderstandable historical reasons, the German government was reluctant to rebuild a \nstrong  military  machine  capable  of  projecting  power  abroad,  relying  instead  on  the \nprotection of the United States. Foreign governments, therefore, had no reason to look \nto  Germany  for  leadership  on  security  issues.  If  they  were  to  be  attracted  to  use  the \nDM,  it  would  have  to  be  for  economic,  not  political  reasons.  As  we  know,  the  DM\u2019s \neconomic  appeal  was  limited  largely  to  the  European  region,  setting  a  natural  limit  to \nthe currency\u2019s scope and domain. \n\n4.  THE YEN \n\nIn  many  ways,  the  story  of  the  Japanese  yen  is  similar.  At  the  end  of  World  War  II, \nJapan lay in ruin, with its economy shattered and its currency virtually worthless. Then, \nJapan too enjoyed an economic miracle, with growth rates from the late 1950s onward \nthat were the envy of the world. By the late 1960s, Japan\u2019s GDP had come to be the \nsecond  largest  in  the  world\u2014larger  even  than  Germany\u2019s.  By  the  late  1970s  the \ninternational standing of the yen was well established. Yet, Japan\u2019s currency ultimately \nreached  its  limit;  indeed,  more  recently,  it  has  in  most  respects  gone  into  seemingly \nirreversible  decline.  Here,  too,  both  economic  and  political  considerations  played \npivotal roles. \n\n4.1  History \n\nThe rise of the yen was impressive but uneven in both scope and domain. At both the \nprivate and official levels, the currency came to be used much more as a store of value \nthan as a medium of exchange or unit of account. Geographically, its reach, like that of \nthe  DM,  remained  primarily  regional,  for  the  most  part  limited  to  the  nations  of  East \nAsia.  Overall,  the  yen  never  managed  to  climb  above  third  place  among  international \ncurrencies, behind not just the dollar but the DM as well.  \n\nThe yen\u2019s internationalization was most notable in financial markets, where persistent \nappreciation made the currency an especially attractive store of value. According to the \ncomposite index constructed at the BIS, the yen\u2019s share of claims in international asset \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nmarkets accelerated swiftly from little more than 3% in 1980 to 12.4% in 1995 (Frenkel \nand Goldstein 1999). Growth was especially rapid in the offshore bond market, where \nthe proportion of new issues denominated in yen more than tripled between 1980 and \n1995, from under 5% to above 17% (Iwami 2000). By the 1990s the yen\u2019s share of the \nbond  market  matched  that  of  the  DM,  though  both  remained  well  short  of  the  dollar. \nThe Japanese currency was especially popular in the East Asian region, where the yen \nsupplanted the dollar as the predominant vehicle for foreign borrowing. Included, most \nnotably,  were  larger  neighbors  like  Indonesia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines,  and  Thailand.  Within  Japan,  non-resident  holdings  of  both  bank  deposits \nand securities expanded steadily through the 1980s and into the 1990s. \n\nLikewise,  for  central  banks  the  yen  became  an  attractive  complement  to  the  dollar  or \nDM  for  purposes  of  portfolio  diversification.  IMF  estimates  suggest  that  during  the \n1980s and early 1990s the yen\u2019s share of global reserves more than doubled, from just \nover  3%  to  close  to  8%.  That  was  only  half  the  portion  accounted  for  by  the  DM  but \nwell ahead of any other currency. Once again the yen was favored most in East Asian \nnations,  where  the  currency\u2019s  share  of  reserves  topped  17%  by  1990  (Tavlas  and \nOzeki 1992; Kawai 1996).  \n\nFor other uses, the yen\u2019s performance was respectable but by no means overpowering. \nIn  foreign-exchange  markets,  the  yen  share  of  currency  trades  accelerated  over  the \ncourse  of  the  1980s  to  a  peak  of  27%  in  1989  but  never  did  surpass  the  proportion \naccounted  for  by  the  DM  (BIS  1999).  Here,  too,  the  appeal  was  mainly  regional. \nJapan\u2019s currency was most favored as a vehicle in East Asia, in financial centers like \nSingapore and Hong Kong, China, where the proportion of business done in yen was \nconsiderably  higher  than  anywhere  else.  Likewise,  in  the  invoicing  of  global  trade, \navailable evidence suggests that there was some expansion of use, but from a very low \nbase and again concentrated mainly in East Asia. The yen\u2019s share in the denomination \nof trade more than doubled during the 1980s but in 1992 still accounted for less than \n5% of the world total. That represented little more than half of Japan\u2019s share of global \nexports (Thygesen et al. 1995). \n\nFinally,  there  was  the  yen\u2019s  potential  as  a  possible  anchor  for  the  exchange  rates  of \nother  currencies.  Over  the  course  of  the  1980s  and  into  the  1990s  there  was  much \ndebate about whether, or to what extent, Japan and its neighbors might be coalescing \ninto  some  kind  of  yen  bloc,  comparable  to  the  emerging  DM  zone  in  Europe.  In  fact, \nmost  governments  in  the  East  Asian  region  preferred  to  maintain  a  managed  float. \nUsually  the  float  was  in  line  with  a  currency  basket  of  some  kind,  though  the \ncomponents of their baskets were rarely disclosed. Econometric analysis suggests that \nincreasingly some of Japan\u2019s neighbors\u2014including, in particular, the Republic of Korea, \nSingapore,  and  Thailand\u2014did  begin  to  shadow  the  yen  more  closely,  putting  greater \nweight  on  the  yen  relative  to  the  dollar  (Frankel  1993;  Frankel  and  Wei  1995). \nHowever, in no economy other than the Republic of Korea did the yen actually surpass \nthe dollar as an anchor; no country ever formally pegged to the yen. If there was a yen \nbloc, it was a feeble one. In the words of one contemporary analysis (Maehara 1993: \n164): \u201cFrom a policy perspective, it appears that the yen has not yet been perceived as \na  key  regional  currency  to  the  extent  that  the  deutsche  mark  is  incorporated  as  an \nanchor  currency  in  the  European  Monetary  System.\u201d  As  another  source  declared \n(B\u00e9nassy-Qu\u00e9r\u00e9  and  Deusy-Fournier  1994:  138)  more  bluntly:  \u201cThe  yen  zone  is \nreduced  to  Japan.\u201d  Correspondingly,  there  was  also  very  little  increase  in  the  use  of \nJapan\u2019s currency for intervention purposes. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\n4.2  Rise \n\nAs  with  the  DM,  the  roots  of  the  yen\u2019s  internationalization  lay  mainly  in  economics, \nthough  in  the  yen\u2019s  case\u2014in  contrast  to  the  DM\u2014there  was  little  reinforcement  from \npolitics.  Unlike  Europe,  post-World  War  II  Asia  never  sought  any  sort  of  formal \nintegration;  there  was  no  local  equivalent  of  the  European  project.  Nor  did  the \nJapanese  government  at  the  time  actively  promote  foreign  use  of  its  currency. \nWidespread  adoption  of  the  yen  occurred  in  the  absence  of\u2014not  because  of\u2014\naffirmative political support. Economic motivations dominated. \n\nTo begin, there was Japan\u2019s enviable inflation record, confirming again the importance \nof monetary stability in the process of internationalization. Over the course of the 1980s \nJapan recorded the lowest price increases of any advanced economy. Annual inflation \naveraged  about  2.6%,  lower  even  than  Germany\u2019s  2.9%  (Tavlas  and  Ozeki  1992).  At \nthe  same  time,  decades  of  trade  surpluses  had  made  Japan  the  world\u2019s  greatest \ncreditor  nation,  even  as  the  United  States  was  becoming  a  net  debtor.  Together  with \nthe  sustained  strength  of  the  yen\u2019s  exchange  rate  and  a  seemingly  stable  political \nsystem,  these  considerations  were  bound  to  make  the  currency  an  attractive  store  of \nvalue  for  investors  and  central  banks  alike.  A  strong  demand  for  yen-denominated \nclaims was assured. \n\nIn  turn,  a  series  of  regulatory  reforms  supported  increased  access  to  a  growing  yen \nsupply  as  well.  During  the  first  decades  after  World  War  II,  Japan\u2019s  financial  system \nwas the most tightly managed of any industrial nation, inhibiting wider use of the yen. \nDomestic  markets  for  equities  and  securities  were  relatively  underdeveloped,  and \nfinancial  institutions  were  rigidly  segmented.  Beginning  in  the  mid-1970s,  however,  a \ngradual process of deregulation began, prompted in particular by a slowing of Japan\u2019s \neconomic  growth.  Interest  rates  were  soon  freed,  encouraging  investor  appetite  for  a \nrapidly  rising  volume  of  public  debt,  and  new  markets  were  created  or  expanded  for \ngovernment  liabilities,  certificates  of  deposits,  and  other  financial  instruments.  The \ntraditional  segmentation  of  institutions  was  relaxed  and  supervisory  practices  were \nstrengthened, gradually increasing both exchange convenience and capital certainty.  \n\nMost importantly, capital controls were largely eliminated, opening the domestic system \nto  greater  foreign  participation.  Earlier,  strict  limitations  on  the  movement  of  funds \nrestricted  both  inward  and  outward  investments,  even  though  convertibility  of  the  yen \nfor current account transactions was restored as early as 1964. But that too began to \nchange  by  the  1980s.  In  1980,  non-resident  access  was  eased  by  a  new  Foreign \nExchange  and  Trade  Control  Law,  which  established  the  principle  that  cross-border \ncapital  flows  should  now  be  free  unless  specifically  restricted.  In  1984,  Tokyo \ncommitted  to  a  panoply  of  further  liberalization  measures  outlined  in  an  agreement \nnegotiated  with  the  United  States.  The  so-called  Yen/Dollar  Agreement  grew  out  of \ndiscussions  of  the  Working  Group  on  Yen/Dollar  Exchange  Rate  Issues\u2014the \nYen/Dollar  Committee\u2014that  had  been  created  jointly  by  the  US  Treasury  and  the \nJapanese Ministry of Finance in 1983. Subsequent years saw a flurry of measures to \nwiden  the  scope  of  allowable foreign  activity  in domestic  banking  and capital  markets \n(Shigehara 1991; Kawai 1996). Overall, the process of liberalization was by no means \ncomplete,  as  contemporary  accounts  emphasized  (Garber  1996).  Cumulatively,  the \ngovernment\u2019s  initiatives  did  suffice  to  increase  Japan\u2019s  integration  into  world  financial \nmarkets and to promote use of the yen for investment and reserve purposes.  \n\nFinally,  there  was  the  massive  size  of  Japan\u2019s  economy  and foreign  trade,  exerting  a \nstrong  gravitational  pull  on  markets  elsewhere.  Without  the  promise  of  a  broad \ntransactional network, the yen would never have become the third most popular vehicle \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nin foreign exchange trading, nor would East Asian governments have given it so much \nweight in the management of their exchange rates. In the 1980s, Japan was seen as a \nnew giant on the world stage, destined perhaps even to surpass the United States as a \nglobal economic power. The appeal of the yen for international use naturally followed. \nFor many, it was only a matter of time before the currency would take its rightful place \nalongside the dollar and the DM at the peak of the Currency Pyramid (Kwan 1994; Hale \n1995). \n\n4.3  Limits \n\nThe anticipated rise of the yen failed to happen. As in the case of the DM, a limit was \neventually reached, and internationalization of the yen peaked somewhere around the \nmid-1990s.  Ever  since,  the  currency\u2019s  standing  has  gradually  declined.  In  banking \nmarkets,  the  yen  share  of  cross  border  claims  has  declined  from  14%  in  the  early \n1990s to under 4% by 2010. Similarly, in bond markets the share has fallen from above \n17%  to  under  3%.  In  currency  markets  the  drop  has  been  from  27%  to  19%,  and  in \ncentral bank reserves, from near 8% to less than 4%. No one today speaks of Japan\u2019s \ncurrency  as  a  future  number  one  (or  even  number  two).  What  happened?  In  this \ninstance, five factors may be cited.  \n\nFirst, once again, was the force of inertia. By the time the yen became prominent in the \n1980s, there were already two well established rivals\u2014the dollar globally and the DM in \nEurope. The incumbency advantages of these two currencies were hard to overcome. \nOutside East Asia, the yen offered no significant gains relative to either one.  \n\nSecond was the crash of the Japanese market after the bursting of its so-called \u201cbubble \neconomy\u201d in 1989. In ensuing years, the country was plagued by stagnation, frequent \nrecessions,  and  persistent  price  deflation,  even  as  the  neighboring  PRC  charged \nahead  with  double-digit growth  rates. Over time the gravitational  pull  of the  Japanese \neconomy simply became less and less forceful.  \n\nThird was the unique pattern of invoicing in Japanese trade, which discouraged foreign \nadoption of the yen as a medium of exchange. Unlike most other advanced economies, \nJapan did relatively little of its overseas business in its own currency. Whereas in the \nUnited States virtually all exports were denominated in dollars and in Germany 80% in \nits  own  currency,  in  Japan  the  corresponding  figure  at  the  time  was  only  some  30\u2013\n35%. Most exports were denominated in dollars, reflecting the central importance of the \nUS  market  as  a  destination  for  Japanese  goods.  The  practice  represented  a  rational \n\u201cpricing to market\u201d strategy to maintain market share in the United States. Only sales to \ndeveloping  countries  tended  to  be  denominated  in  yen.  Over  time,  there  was  some \nincrease in yen invoicing, mainly due to the growing salience of East Asia as an export \nmarket (Sato 1999). But as noted, even at its peak the currency\u2019s share in global trade \nremained remarkably small.  \n\nFourth  was  the  role  of  public  policy  in  Japan,  which  for  years  was  notably  unhelpful. \nLike the Germans, the authorities in Tokyo were long resistant to internationalization of \ntheir  currency,  which  they  too  feared  might  in  time  impose  an  undue  constraint  on \ndomestic  monetary  management.  Some  in  the  government  did  take  a  more  positive \ntone. Most notable was the Council on Foreign Exchange and Other Transactions, an \nadvisory  body  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  which  in  1985  called  for  further  financial \nliberalization to enhance the yen\u2019s international appeal. For the most part, however, the \nregulatory reforms of the 1980s were adopted reluctantly, partly to stimulate domestic \ngrowth, as indicated, but also as a grudging concession to the United States. Through \nthe  Yen/Dollar  Committee,  Washington  pressured  Tokyo  to  liberalize  its  financial \nstructure  in  hopes  of  raising  demand  for  the  yen.  The  idea  was  to  engineer  an \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nappreciation of the yen that would improve the competitiveness of US goods vis-\u00e0-vis \nJapan. Yen internationalization was seen by most Japanese not as a goal to be sought, \nbut rather as a price to be paid to retain the good will of the Americans.  \n\nIn  fact,  appreciation  did  occur,  particularly  after  the  well-publicized  Plaza  Accord  of \n1985,  but  with  consequences  that  were  not  anticipated  at  the  time.  In  order  to  soften \nthe  adverse  effects  of  the  appreciation,  Japan\u2019s  central  bank  pushed  interest  rates  to \nhistorically low levels. The result was a marked increase in speculation in the equities \nand real estate markets, which fed the bubble that finally burst in 1989. Many in Japan \nhave  blamed  the  United  States,  at  least  in  part,  for  the  prolonged  deflation  that \nfollowed,  harking  back  to  the  pressures  Washington  exerted  through  the  Yen/Dollar \nAgreement and Plaza Accord (e.g., Okina et al. 2001; Hamada and Okada 2009).  \n\nInterestingly,  as  Tokyo  struggled  to  come  to  grips  with  the  country\u2019s  post-bubble \ndownturn,  opinion  on  internationalization  shifted.  Over  the  course  of  the  1990s, \nstrengthening the international role of the yen became a declared policy objective in the \nhopes  that  it  would  help  promote  economic  recovery  at  home  (Grimes  2003).  Most \ndramatic was a multi-year financial liberalization program announced in 1996, dubbed \nthe  \u201cBig  Bang\u201d  in  imitation  of  the  swift  deregulation  of  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  capital \nmarkets a decade earlier. Under the Big Bang all remaining capital controls were to be \neliminated  and  a  variety  of  other  ambitious  measures  were  scheduled,  including  tax \nreductions  and  increases  in  the  range  of  available  financial  products.  Especially  after \nthe  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997\u20131998,  a  concerted  effort  was  made  to  promote \nbroader use of the yen for a variety of purposes, guided by the recommendations of a \nnewly  established  Study  Group  on  the  Promotion  of  Yen  Internationalization.  But  by \nthat  time  it  was  too  late.  As  economic  stagnation  dragged  on,  the  government\u2019s \ncampaign  failed  to  reverse  the  declining  interest  in  the  yen.  Defeat  was  admitted  in \n2003  when  the  strategy  was  officially  abandoned.  In  the  words  of  one  Japanese \nobserver, \u201cit  was  clear  that  any further  attempt to  internationalize  the  yen\u2026  would  be \nfutile\u201d (Takagi 2012: 83).   \n\nFinally,  there  was  also  a  security  dimension.  Like  Germany,  post-World  War  II  Japan \nwas  considered  to  be  a  stable  democracy  with  full  respect  for  property  rights  and \neffective policy management. Investors were probably attracted for those reasons, but \nas powerful as it was in economic terms, Japan lacked the political means to influence \nthe  currency  preferences  of  foreign  governments.  It  was  in  no  position  to  offer \nleadership  on  security  issues.  Limited  by  its  occupation  constitution  to  a  modest  self-\ndefense force, Tokyo  was  incapable  of projecting military  power  beyond  the  country\u2019s \nhome  islands.  Indeed,  Japan  was  obliged  to  seek  protection  under  the  security \numbrella  of  the  United  States.  Also,  there  were  no  nations  in  the  region  prepared  to \nfollow Japan\u2019s lead. Memories were still fresh of Tokyo\u2019s wartime atrocities and pre-war \nattempts to build an imperial Greater East-Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Here too, as in \nthe  case  of  the  DM,  it  appeared  that  if  others  were  to  be  attracted  to  use  the  yen,  it \nwould have to be for economic, not political reasons.   \n\n5.  THE EURO \n\nThe last antecedent to be considered is the euro, Europe\u2019s joint currency. In 1999 the \nEuropean  Union  (EU)  began  its  grand  experiment\u2014the  new  Economic  and  Monetary \nUnion  (EMU),  with  the  euro  as  its  centerpiece.  Although  still  a  story  in  progress,  the \ncontours of the tale are by now clear, bearing a strong resemblance to the experience \nof  the  yen  (albeit  on  a  more  compressed  time  scale).  After  a  fast  start  following  the \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\ncurrency\u2019s  birth,  euro  internationalization  appears  to  have  quickly  reached  a  limit.  In \nmore recent years, it may even have gone into reverse. \n\n5.1  History \n\nA fast early start was not unexpected, given the euro\u2019s credentials. From the moment \nof its birth, Europe\u2019s new currency clearly enjoyed many of the qualities necessary for \ncompetitive success on the world stage. These included a large economic base in the \nmembership  of  the  eurozone,  which  initially  numbered  eleven  countries\u2014including \nsome of the world\u2019s richest economies\u2014and has now increased to eighteen. They also \nincluded  deep  and  resilient  financial  markets,  unquestioned  political  stability,  and  an \nenviably  low  rate  of  inflation,  all  backed  by  a  joint  monetary  authority,  the  European \nCentral  Bank  (ECB),  which  was  fully  committed  to  preserving  confidence  in  the \ncurrency\u2019s  future  value.  For  many  observers,  the  global  future  of  the  euro  seemed \nsecure; for some, it seemed that Europe\u2019s currency might even overtake the dollar as \nthe  world\u2019s  pre-eminent  currency  (Chinn  and  Frankel  2008;  Papaioannou  and  Portes \n2008). Hence it was no surprise that in the euro\u2019s early days, international use seemed \nto expand exponentially. \n\nSoon, however, momentum slowed. The currency\u2019s fast start appears to have peaked \nsometime  around  2003\u20132004; thereafter,  use for  cross-border  purposes  leveled  off  at \nrates well below those enjoyed by the dollar. In effect, the euro did little more than hold \nits  own  compared  to  the  past  aggregate  market  shares  of  the  EMU\u2019s  \u201clegacy\u201d \ncurrencies. Given the fact that Germany\u2019s old DM had already attained a number-two \nranking  in  global  monetary  relations,  second  to  the  dollar,  anything  less  would  have \nbeen  a  real  shock.  However  beyond  that,  a  limit  does  appear  to  have  exerted  itself. \nStraight-line  extrapolation  of  the  euro\u2019s  early  acceleration  far  into  the  future  does  not \nseem to have been warranted. \n\nLimits  were  evident  in  terms  of  both  scope  and  domain.  On  the  one  side,  growth  of \neuro  usage  was  broad  but,  like  the  DM  before  it,  sharply  uneven  across  functional \ncategories.  The  early  expansion  of  international  use  was  especially  dramatic  in  the \nissuance  of  debt  securities,  reflecting  the  promised  integration  of  Europe\u2019s  financial \nmarkets. There was also some modest increase in the euro\u2019s share of trade invoicing \nand central bank reserves. But in other categories, such as foreign exchange trading or \nbanking, there was little penetration. The ECB\u2019s (2008: 7) polite way of putting this was \nthat use of the euro turned out to be \u201cheterogeneous across market segments.\u201d  \n\nOn the other side, the euro\u2019s domain turned out to be starkly bifurcated, just as it had \nbeen for the DM. For the most part, internationalization of the euro has been confined \nto  economies  with  close  geographical  and/or  institutional  links  to  the  EU  and  euro \nzone.  These  include  the  EU\u2019s  newest  members,  all  destined  eventually  to  join  the \nmonetary  union,  as  well  other  candidate  states  (for  example,  Croatia  or  Montenegro) \nand  non-member  neighbors  like  Norway  and  Switzerland.  They  also  include  several \nnations  around  the  Mediterranean  littoral  as  well  as  a  number  in  sub-Saharan  Africa. \nWhere  trade  and  financial  ties  are  deep,  the  euro  obviously  enjoys  a  special \nadvantage. However elsewhere, in stark contrast, scale of use drops off abruptly. The \nevidence, concludes the ECB (2010: 7), clearly confirms \u201cthe strong regional character \nof the euro\u2019s international role.\u201d \n\nWorse,  in  more  recent  years,  some  of  the  euro\u2019s  achievements  have  even  been \nreversed  as  global  crisis  has  lingered  and  Europe\u2019s  debt  and  banking  problems  have \nmultiplied.  Given  the  adverse  circumstances,  the  ECB  (2012:  7,  9)  says  the  currency \nhas  remained  notably  \u201cresilient.\u201d  That  is  at  best  a  backhanded  compliment,  referring \nmainly to the relative stability of the euro\u2019s exchange rate. In terms of actual use, key \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nindicators have started to trend downward. The global share of debt securities issued in \neuros, for example, which had peaked at one-third in 2004, began to slide in 2009, and \nby the end of 2011 was down to less than one-quarter (ECB 2012: 58). Similarly, the \neuro\u2019s share of international reserves, which had exceeded 27% as recently as 2009, \nfell  to  below  24%  by the  end  of  2012.  Most  of the  decline,  according to  the IMF,  was \naccounted for by developing countries, where central banks sold off \u20ac45 billion in 2012, \ncutting  their  holdings  by  8%.  \u201cResilience,\u201d  plainly,  is  in  the  eye  of  the  beholder.  The \nbest we can say, truthfully, is that it could have been worse. \n\n5.2  Limits \n\nThe  reasons  for  the  euro\u2019s  early  rise  are  clear.  Despite  the  skepticism  of  some, \nincluding  myself  (Cohen  2003),  the  currency\u2019s  credentials  appeared  obvious.  Yet  it \nfailed to live up to its potential. Why? Here four factors seem paramount.  \n\nFirst  is  the  familiar  force  of  inertia,  which  in  this  instance  acted  as  a  double-edged \nsword.  Within  the  European  region  itself,  where  the  DM  already  predominated, \nadoption  of  the  euro  as  the  DM\u2019s  successor  was  only  to  be  expected.  In  the  eyes  of \nmany, the euro was simply the DM writ large. Inevitably, the new currency would inherit \nthe natural hinterland of the old. But beyond the immediate neighborhood, the force of \ninertia worked the other way, to favor the US dollar with all its incumbency advantages. \nIn this respect, the euro was able to make no more headway than the DM or the yen \nbefore it.   \n\nSecond  has  been  the  absence  of  any  pro-active  policy  by  European  authorities  to \npromote a major role for the euro. Like the German and Japanese governments before \nit, the EMU has been at best ambivalent about internationalization. From the beginning, \nin  principle  neither  discouraging  nor \npolicy  has  remained  studiously  neutral, \nencouraging wider use by foreigners. According to an authoritative early statement by \nthe  ECB  (1999:  31),  repeated  many  times  since,  development  of  the  euro  as  an \ninternational currency\u2014if it were to happen at all\u2014would be a market-driven process, \nand simply one of many possible byproducts of monetary union. Policy makers would \ntake no action to directly enhance the currency\u2019s appeal.   \n\nThird, once again, is the security dimension. How could EMU\u2014a gaggle of states with \nlimited  military  capabilities  and  divergent  foreign-policy  interests\u2014possibly  substitute \nfor  the  global  influence  of  the  United  States?  How  could  others  look  to  Europe  for \nprotection?  As  economist  Adam  Posen  (2008:  80)  comments:  \u201cThe  European  Union, \nlet alone the euro area itself, is unable or unwilling to offer these systemic or security \nbenefits beyond a very limited area.\u201d Bessma Momani (2008: 309), a political scientist, \nechoes:  \u201cWhile  there  are  viable  currency  alternatives  to  the  US  dollar,  there  are  no \nalternatives  to  the  US  military  security  umbrella.\u201d  Few  governments  had  any  political \ninterest in switching their currency allegiance to a weaker patron. \n\nFinally\u2014and  perhaps  most  importantly  of  all\u2014is  the  issue  of  the  euro\u2019s  internal \ngovernance. For all their other limitations, this was never a question for the DM or yen. \nNo  one  doubted \nthat  Germany  and  Japan  were  capable  of  effective  policy \nmanagement. The euro, as the joint currency of a club of sovereign states, is obviously \ndifferent;  a  currency,  in  effect,  without  a  country.  A  fundamental  mismatch  exists \nbetween  the  domain  of  the  EMU  and  the  jurisdictions  of  its  member  governments, \nwhich makes decision making problematic at best. The euro is the product of an inter-\nstate  treaty  rather  than  the  expression  of  a  single  sovereign  power.  For  outsiders, \ntherefore,  the  currency  can  be  considered  only  as  good  as  the  political  agreement \nunderlying  it;  and  as  recent  experience  in  Europe  has  vividly  demonstrated,  the \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nrequisite  agreement  is  often  tenuous  at  best.  Foreigners  cannot  be  blamed  for  not \nwishing to put too many eggs into that fragile basket.    \n\n6.  LESSONS \n\nWhat lessons are suggested by these three cases for the future prospects of the yuan? \nAlthough the sample is admittedly small, much can be learned from the prior examples \nof  the  DM,  yen,  and  euro.  Given  the  PRC\u2019s  apparent  determination  to  promote \ninternationalization  of  the  yuan,  the  lessons  may  be  framed  as  a  series  of  \u201cdos  and \ndon\u2019ts\u201d for Beijing\u2014ten commandments for the Long March toward world status. \n\n1. Don\u2019t  underestimate  the  power  of inertia. International currency use is obviously \npath  dependent.  It  is  not  a  level  playing  field;  market  actors  and  governments  are \nalready  locked  into  certain  patterns  of  behavior,  institutionally  and  linguistically. \nNewcomers, therefore, start at a distinct competitive disadvantage that may be difficult \nto overcome. Inducing agents to switch is not impossible; the yuan\u2019s three antecedents \nall  showed  that  barriers  to  entry  can  be  overcome  to  some  extent,  but  the  challenge, \nclearly,  is  daunting.  The  yuan  must  not  just  be  as  good  as  the  dollar  or  other \ninternational  currencies.  It  must,  somehow,  promise  to  be  better  than  existing \nincumbents to surmount the powerful force of inertia.   \n\nMuch  depends,  of  course,  on  what  happens  to  the  existing  incumbents.  The  pre-\neminence  of  the  dollar  has  long  been  threatened  by  the  US\u2019s  persistent  payments \ndeficits and accumulating foreign debt, which many believe must sooner or later erode \nits global competitive advantage. In the words of Barry Eichengreen (2011: 5\u20136), \u201cas a \nresult  of  the  financial  mismanagement\u2026  the  dollar\u2019s  singular  status  is  in  doubt.\u201d \nSwitching away from the dollar could become increasingly attractive, paving the way for \ngreater  use  of  the  yuan.  Yet  even  then,  the  yuan  would  face  formidable  obstacles \nowing  to  the  lingering  presence  of  other  potential  rivals.  The  yuan  would  not  be  the \ndefault  choice.  In  the  European  neighborhood,  as  indicated,  the  euro  still  enjoys  a \nspecial  advantage.  Likewise,  the  dollar  is  apt  to  retain  its  appeal  in  the  Western \nHemisphere  and  perhaps  also  in  the  Middle  East.  Even  the  yen,  for  all  its  troubles, \nremains a popular option in financial markets. The most likely outcome would not be a \nnew  monetary  order  dominated  by  the  yuan,  but  rather  something  closer  to  a  multi-\ncurrency  universe\u2014what  I  have  elsewhere  called  a  \u201cleaderless  currency  system\u201d \n(Cohen 2011), with several \u201cpeer\u201d competitors in contention and no single currency at \nthe top. \n\n2.  Don\u2019t  be  passive.  Following  from  the  first  lesson,  it  would  seem  vital  to  actively \nsupport the internationalization process through public policy. That none of the yuan\u2019s \nantecedents  managed  to  achieve  its  full  promise  cannot  be  blamed  entirely  on  the \nambivalence or resistance of their issuing authorities; as indicated, many others factors \nwere  also  involved.  But  the  lack  of  official  backing  surely  did  not  help.  Affirmative \ngovernment  action  may  not  be  sufficient  to  bring  the  yuan  to  the  top  of  the  currency \npyramid, but arguably, it may be necessary. Judging from the many actions that have \nalready been taken by Beijing to promote international use of the yuan (Cohen 2013), \nthe PRC\u2019s leaders would appear to need no convincing on that point. \n\n3. Don\u2019t be too ambitious. A global domain for the yuan, rivaling the worldwide reach \nof the dollar, may be a worthy goal, but it is unlikely to be immediately attainable. Both \nlogic  and  experience  suggest  that  internationalization  tends  to  start  close  to  home, \nbuilding  on  close  geographical  and  institutional  linkages,  and  only  then  may  go  on  to \ntrue  world  status.  It  stands  to  reason  that,  initially  at  least,  a  currency  will  be  most \nappealing  to  neighbors  with  extensive  trade  or  financial  ties.  That  is  the  way  the \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nprocess  worked  with  all  three  antecedents  discussed  in  this  paper,  each  of  which \nstarted  in  a  specific  region.  Going  further  back  in  history,  one  could  argue  that  the \nsame  was  true  for  the  early  rise  of  both  the  pound  sterling  and  the  dollar  as  well.  A \nrealistic  pro-active  strategy for  the  yuan  would  aim  to  consolidate  a firm base  in  East \nAsia before reaching out to other parts of the globe. \n\n4. Do  sustain  price  stability. To be competitive, a currency must inspire confidence. \nIn  this  regard,  the  three  antecedents  confirm  the  importance  of  a  record  of  relatively \nlow inflation, especially for a currency\u2019s use as a store of value. The yuan is unlikely to \nhold  much  appeal  to  investors  or  central  banks  if  its  future  value  is  not  reasonably \nassured.  To  date,  the  PRC\u2019s  central  bank,  the  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  (PBOC),  has \nbeen notably successful in keeping a lid on the rate of price increases despite decades \nof rapid economic expansion. However, few would deny that the task has been made \neasier  by  a  wide  panoply  of government  controls  over  interest rates,  the quantity  and \nallocation  of  credit,  cross-border  capital  flows,  and  the  yuan  exchange  rate.  Many  of \nthese controls are slated for relaxation or removal as the country moves\u2014in the words \nof the ruling party\u2019s central committee after its most recent meeting in November 2013 \n\u2014to make market forces play a \u201cdecisive\u201d role in the economy. The question is whether \nthe  PBOC  will  be  able  to  sustain  its  record  of  success  in  a  more  liberalized  financial \nenvironment.  Doubts  are  only  to  be  expected  so  long  as  the  PBOC  falls  short  of  the \ndegree  of  political  independence  enjoyed  by  the  Federal  Reserve  and  all  other  major \ncentral banks. \n\n5. Do maintain a reputation for effective policy management. All three antecedents \nconfirm  the  importance  of  stable  and  effective  economic  governance  as  a  source  of \nconfidence.  The  early  rise  of  each  of  the  three  currencies  was  associated  with  rapid \neconomic growth,  a  trade  surplus,  and  high  employment. In  the cases  of  the  DM  and \nthe  yen,  it  helped  that  Germany  and  Japan  emerged  as  major  creditor  nations.  Non-\nresidents  had  no  reason  to  fear  for  the  solvency  of  either  currency.  Conversely,  the \nsubsequent setbacks for the yen and euro were clearly attributable, at least in part, to \nstunning policy reversals\u2014in one case, the bursting of Japan\u2019s bubble economy; in the \nother, a wave of sovereign debt and banking problems.  \n\nFor  many,  of  course,  it  is  tempting  to  blame  those  policy  reversals  on  others.  As \nindicated,  many  Japanese  have  held  the  United  States  at  least  partly  responsible  for \nthe  bubble  economy  of  the  1980s  that  subsequently  brought  them  so  much  pain. \nLikewise,  many  Europeans  attribute  their  tribulations  today  to  the  global  crisis  that \nstarted with the excesses of the US housing market before 2007. The issue is not how \ntroubles start but how well a government deals with them once the storm breaks. For \nthree  decades,  the  PRC\u2019s  record  of  overall  economic  success  was  unmatched.  More \nrecently,  however,  blemishes  have  begun  to  appear,  including  slower  growth,  rising \nlabor  costs,  increasing  levels  of  debt,  glaring  income  inequalities,  and  severe \nenvironmental problems. Does the PRC face its own policy reversal? Trust in the yuan \nwill be damaged, possibly irreversibly, if Beijing is unable to keep the ship of state on \nan even keel. \n\n6.  Do  cultivate  extensive  trade  relations.  For  all  three  antecedents,  a  broad \ntransactional  network  was  critical  to  their  early  internationalization.  Where  a  high \nproportion of the issuer\u2019s exports were denominated in the home currency, as was the \ncase for both the DM and the euro, extensive trade relations encouraged broader use \nfor purposes of invoicing and settlement. In all three instances, the gravitational pull of \nstrong  trade  ties  led  to  closer  exchange  rate  relationships  and  greater  use  for \nintervention and reserve purposes as well. As the world export leader, the PRC would \nseem to be in an excellent position to boost use of the yuan as a medium of exchange.  \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\nTrade volume alone, however, will not be enough. The structure of trade relations will \nalso make a difference. The PRC today, despite its great weight as a trading nation, is \nsimilar to Japan in that it has only a small percentage of its exports denominated in its \nown  currency.  To  a  large  extent,  that  is  due  to  the  distinctive  character  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nforeign  trade  structure,  which  to  date  has  been  highly  networked.  With  its  low  labor \ncosts, the PRC has made itself into the \u201cworld\u2019s workshop\u201d by encouraging imports of \nhigh valued-added inputs and components that could then be processed or assembled \ninto  lower  value-added final  products for  export. In  such  a  network  structure  it makes \nsense  to  \u201cprice  to  market,\u201d  denominating  all  the  links  of  the  production  chain  in  one \nwidely accepted international currency such as the dollar. That is not likely to change \nsubstantially  unless  the  PRC  can  succeed  with  plans  to  move  up  the  technological \nscale to more home-grown, high value-added industrial goods, as it has already done \nin areas like solar panels and wind turbines. Across the industrial world, as indicated, \nexports of differentiated manufactured goods typically tend to be invoiced and settled in \nthe seller\u2019s own currency. The more the PRC is able to move its production structure in \nthat direction, the easier it will be to expand the yuan\u2019s role in international trade. \n\n7.  Do  broaden  convertibility.  At  a  minimum,  convertibility  for  current  account \ntransactions  would  seem  to  be  an  absolute  requirement  to  get  the  process  of \ninternationalization going. But what about the capital account? As the stories of the DM \nand the yen both demonstrate, widespread adoption of a currency for cross border use \nis  possible  even  in  the  presence  of  a  substantial  array  of  capital  controls.  Serious \nfinancial  liberalization  did  not  begin  in  either  Germany  or  Japan  until  well  after  their \ncurrencies had already gained broad acceptance. This would seem to suggest that full \nconvertibility  of  the  yuan  is  by  no  means  necessary.  But  it  is  also  clear  that  the \nachievements of the DM and yen might have been even greater had full convertibility \nbeen introduced earlier. A degree of currency internationalization was sacrificed for the \nsake of maintaining a grip on domestic financial conditions.  \n\nToday,  the  PRC  faces  the  same  trade-off.  Some  broadening  of  capital  account \nconvertibility  seems  necessary  to  promote  interest  in  the  yuan  as  an  investment \nmedium or reserve asset. How much convertibility, however, is a matter of choice. At a \nminimum,  market  actors  and  central  banks  would  need  to  be  given  full  freedom  to \nestablish yuan bank accounts and to buy and sell selected classes of PRC bonds and \nstocks.  Few foreigners  are  likely  to  see  yuan  denominated  claims  as  attractive  if  they \ncannot  be  acquired  or  sold  at  will.  Equally  important  would  be  the  right  to  issue  new \nfacilitate  portfolio  balancing. \nyuan  debt  or  equities \nInternationalization on the asset side must be complemented by internationalization on \nthe liability side. However, at the same time, trading in certain classes of liquid claims\u2014\nespecially  in  more  speculative  sectors  such  as  options,  futures,  or  other  exotic \nderivatives\u2014might  well  remain  prohibited  or  tightly  regulated  to  reduce  the  risk  of \ndestabilizing capital flows. The idea would be to encourage greater use of the yuan as \na store of value while minimizing resulting vulnerabilities.  \n\nthe  PRC \n\nin  order \n\nto \n\nin \n\nComplicating the trade-off is the fact that today many more currencies are convertible \nthan was the case in the 1970s and 1980s, offering market actors and central banks a \nwider range of opportunities. In principle, this would seem to increase the pressure on \nBeijing  to  liberalize  fully.  Given  the  PRC\u2019s  great  economic  importance,  even  a  partial \nopening  of  the  capital  account  could  be  expected  to  attract  wider  use  of  the  yuan. \nThough  the  availability  of  more  accessible  alternatives  might  slow  down  the  yuan\u2019s \nLong March to an elevated status, it would be unlikely to stop the currency\u2019s ascent. In \npractice,  some  range  of  restrictions  on  more  speculative  market  sectors  could  be \npreserved to sustain financial control at home. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\n8.  Do  promote  financial  market  development.  Convertibility  alone,  however,  is  not \nenough.  Access  is  just  part  of  the  story.  The  cases  of  the  DM  and  yen  also \ndemonstrate  how  important  it  is  to  promote  the  development  of  deep  and  resilient \nfinancial  markets  capable  of  meeting  the  needs  of  international  investors  and  central \nbanks.  Opening  the  capital  account  is  just  the  beginning.  Equally  important  is \nassurance  of  an  adequate  degree  of  exchange  convenience  and  capital  certainty. \nSectors that are to be opened to foreign investors must offer both low transaction costs \nand a level of turnover high enough to ensure that large new orders will not generate \nmajor  price  shifts.  Achieving  these  goals  takes  time,  and  it  is  no  secret  that  the  PRC \nstill has a long way to go on these matters.  \n\n9.  Don\u2019t  ignore  domestic  political  institutions.  Among  the  qualities  that  made  the \nDM and yen attractive were domestic political stability and unquestioned respect for the \nrule  of  law.  Both  Germany  and  Japan  were  reborn  after  World  War  II  as  functioning \npluralistic  democracies,  where  agents  could  reasonably  assume  that  contractual \nobligations  would  be  fairly  and  effectively  enforced.  Gone  was  the  arbitrariness  and \nunpredictability  of  authoritarian  government.  Had  circumstances  been  otherwise,  it  is \nhard  to  imagine  either  country\u2019s  currency  gaining  much  traction  in  international \nmarkets.  Recall  that  non-nationals  cannot  be  compelled  to  make  use  of  a  currency; \nthey must be persuaded. But why would actors deliberately and unnecessarily expose \nthemselves to serious political risk? \n\nIn the PRC\u2019s case this would seem to suggest that some degree of domestic political \nreform, to assure adequate respect for property rights, will be essential to heighten the \nappeal of the yuan. Trust in the country\u2019s institutions must be laboriously cultivated. In \nthis regard, too, the PRC still has a long way to go. In the words of one astute observer \n(Lo 2013: 162): \u201cChina faces a credibility problem\u2026 Without political reform supporting \ndeeper  structural  reforms,  the  internationalization  process  would  either  stall  or  go \nastray.\u201d \n\n10.  Don\u2019t  ignore  geopolitics.  Foremost  among  factors  that  limited  adoption  of  the \nyuan\u2019s  three  antecedents  was  the  security  dimension\u2014the  inability  of  any  of  their \nissuers to match the military prowess of the United States. None could offer the same \nkind of security guarantees that Washington routinely extends to foreign governments \nthat  use  its  currency. The  PRC,  by  contrast,  is rapidly  developing  an  ability  to  project \npower  beyond  its  borders,  which  could  in  time  encourage  some  states  to  switch  their \nmonetary allegiance. Much depends, however, on how others perceive Beijing\u2019s foreign \npolicy intentions. Will the PRC use its power defensively, to help promote peace in East \nAsia  or  elsewhere;  or  aggressively,  to  pursue  controversial  national  goals  (such  as \nterritorial claims in the East and South China Seas)? The outcome is yet to be seen. \n\n7.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nThis essay began with the question: Will history repeat itself? Or will the yuan prove to \nbe an exception, as the currency that finally managed to keep ascending where others \nfaltered? The answer, not surprisingly, is uncertain. A look at the past cannot provide \nan  infallible  guide  to  the  future.  However,  a  review  of  three  recent  antecedents\u2014the \nDM,  the  yen,  and  the  euro\u2014does  help  to  identify  the  factors,  both  economic  and \npolitical,  that seem most  likely  to  determine the yuan\u2019s  prospects.  I  have  summarized \nthe principal lessons to be drawn from these earlier experiences in a decalogue of ten \ncommandments. \n\nThe main message of my analysis is that the challenge of yuan internationalization is \nformidable,  involving  very  demanding  conditions.  The  principal  conditions  may  be \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 453        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cohen \n\n(commandment  6)?

Can geopolitical tensions be avoided (commandment 10)? Contrary to predictions \nof  the  yuan\u2019s  rise,  success  in  all  these  respects  is  by  no  means  guaranteed.
