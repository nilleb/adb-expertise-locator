This is the Decision on the merits of the Further Application submitted initially on behalf \nof 1061 International Staff (Perrin, et al., ADBAT Decision No. 109 (6 May 2017)) seeking relief \nfrom the effect of changes to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d, \u201cthe ADB\u201d or \n\u201cthe Bank\u201d) education assistance (\u201cEA\u201d) benefits provided to its International Staff. Proceedings \non the merits had been suspended while objections to jurisdiction were considered in Perrin, et al. \n(No. 2), ADBAT Decision No. 112 (28 February 2018).  In Decision No. 112 the Tribunal upheld \nthe Bank\u2019s preliminary objections for 59 Applications while joining the remaining 37 Applications \nit considered admissible.   \n \n2.  The EA changes were part of a broader revision of ADB\u2019s compensation and benefits \npackage that was applicable to International Staff, National Staff, and Administrative Staff at all \nduty stations including Headquarters. These changes were implemented in the context of the \nRespondent\u2019s 2020 Strategy. After an almost year-long consultation period, these final changes \nwere  notified  to  staff  on  16  December  2015  and  introduced  effective  1  January  2016  by \nAdministrative Order (\u201cAO\u201d) No. 3.06 (\u201cEducation Assistance\u201d). \n \n3.  The Applicants contend that the right to receive the EA is a fundamental and essential term \nof their employment contract and, as such, cannot be unilaterally altered by the Respondent.     \n                                                      \n1 Later reduced to 96 Applicants. \n1 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n \nI. THE FACTS \n \nChanges to the EA \n \n4.  Reference can be made to the facts given in Decision No. 109 and Decision No. 112. It is \nappropriate, however, to give a summary below.  \n \n5.  The EA is one element, and an important element, of the remuneration package of \nInternational Staff. The stated purpose of the EA is to provide education assistance to International \nStaff towards costs of educating their dependent children. The provision of EA is based on the \nunderlying premise of cost-sharing between the Bank and eligible International Staff, so that the \nassistance provides a percentage (not the full amount) of the costs, with a cap on the grant.2The \n \nchallenged changes both expanded and adjusted different components of those benefits. Two key \nrevisions introduced were the level of tuition subsidy and a new methodology to determine the flat \nrate allowance that helped meet non-tuition related costs of pursuing education outside the duty \nstation. \n \n6.  The grant consists of several elements, covering tuition fees, board and lodging, and travel, \nto each of which caps are applied. The EA package is regularly reviewed. The impugned measures, \nfor example, took effect on 1 January 2016 and are laid down in AO No. 3.06. They replaced an \nearlier version of this AO that entered into force from the 2007/08 academic year. This latter \nversion replaced one that was issued on 1 January 2002.  \n \n7.  The EA changes were introduced following a regular quinquennial review of ADB\u2019s \ncompensation and benefits package, which took place in the context of the ADB\u2019s 2020 Strategy \nand the related \u201cOur People Strategy\u201d, which emphasized the need to provide remuneration and \n                                                      \n2 An early policy ADB Board Paper from 1968 noted, \u201cIt is intended that Education Grants will offset, to a reasonable extent, the \nadditional educational costs which a professional staff member incurs as a result of his assuming duty away from the home country \nand not being in a position to continue educating his child in his homeland or in the same household.\u201d \n2 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nbenefits that are competitive in the international marketplace and in each location where the Bank \noperates.3  \n \n8.  The objectives of the 2015 Comprehensive Review were explained to staff to include: (i) \nassessment of the competitiveness of the Bank\u2019s compensation and benefits policies with reference \nto global or local employment markets from which the Bank recruits its staff; (ii) assessment of \nsustainability  and  cost  efficiency  of  ADB\u2019s  compensation  and  benefits  policies  and  its \neffectiveness  in  supporting  talent  acquisition,  staff  development  and  retention;  and  (iii) \nidentification of areas where changes in the staffing, compensation and benefits policies are \nrequired to support the Bank\u2019s business needs and changing workforce demographics. \n \n9.  The main findings of the 2015 Comprehensive Review in relation to international staff \nwere that (i) the compensation was \u201con par or above comparators,\u201d and (ii) the benefits (including \nthe Bank\u2019s education assistance) were \u201cabove the median and average of the comparators\u201d. \n \n10.  The President also explained that the Bank was proposing the changes as: \n \n(a)  \u201cour  compensation  and  benefits  should  be  consistent  with  our  mission  of \neradicating poverty in the region\u201d; \n \n(b)  \u201cwe  need  to  pay  attention  to  greater  equity  between  different  personal \ncircumstances of our individual staff members\u201d [noting an overemphasis on \nbenefits for international staff with children in higher education]; and \n \n(c)  \u201cwe compared our system carefully with other international financial institutions, \nand found some benefits go beyond what our comparators offer [and] \u2026. there is \nroom for improving some other benefits.\u201d \n \n11.  A great number of proposals for changes to salaries and benefits were made. They were \nsubject to extensive consultations, including at town-hall meetings, and the proposals were, as a \nconsequence, substantially modified. The changes both expanded and adjusted various component \nparts of the education grants and allowances program.  The major changes are the following:   \n                                                      \n3 This is also in accordance with paragraph 3.2 of AO No. 3.01 (on Salary Administration), which provides that ADB\u2019s salaries are \nmaintained at levels competitive with those in comparator organizations and with due regard to the duty station concerned. \n \n3 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v.

PROCEEDINGS \n \nOriginal Application and Decision No. 109 \n \n12.  On 16 June 2016 the original Application was, with the Respondent\u2019s agreement, submitted \ndirectly to the Tribunal pursuant to Article II(3)(a) of the Asian Development Bank Administrative \nTribunal\u2019s Statute (\u201cADBAT Statute\u201d) and Rule 6(8) of its Rules of Procedure (\u201cthe Tribunal\u2019s \nRules\u201d). The Application had provided simply the names of 122 Applicants without any supporting \ndata, and so the Tribunal directed the Applicants to submit additional documents. The Tribunal \nsubsequently received the names and birthdates of children for 106 of the 122 Applicants. The \nRespondent raised the issue of locus standi for nine Applicants who did not have children but \n4 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \notherwise did not raise preliminary objections to the admissibility of the cases or to the jurisdiction \nof the Tribunal. The case was considered by the Tribunal on 6 May 2017 in its Decision No. 109. \n \n13.  In Decision No. 109, the Tribunal dealt with the matter of admissibility sua sponte and held \nthat the original Application was inadmissible as the Applicants had failed to substantiate how the \nrules had adversely affected them on an individual basis. However, the Tribunal noted the need \nfor a determination in law regarding the question whether the EA changes adopted by the Bank \nviolated fundamental and essential rights of its employees under their employment contracts and \ninvited the Applicants, if they chose, to submit a further application that met the requirements for \nadmissibility as set out in its Decision. \n \nFurther Application and Decision No. 112 \n \n14.  On  8  September  2017,  106  Applicants  (16  Applicants  having  formally  withdrawn) \nsubmitted their Further Application. The Applicants chose not to seek to repeat the facts and the \nlaw that they had already pleaded as part of their original Application and 30 September 2016 \nReply. The Applicants asserted that jurisdiction ratione temporis had been satisfied and that the \nissue of joinder of the Applicants was for the Tribunal to decide. The Further Application put \nforward seven Applicants as \u201crepresentative examples\u201d but otherwise continued to rely on the \nBank\u2019s cooperation in providing relevant calculations of loss for each Applicant. \n \n15.  On  7  November  2017,  the  Respondent  submitted  its  Preliminary  Objections  to  the \nJurisdiction of the Tribunal in accordance with Rule 7 (6), of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules. The Respondent \ndid not produce further background elements in its Preliminary Objections to the Jurisdiction of \nthe Tribunal and it reserved its position on the joinder of Applications. It agreed that four \nApplicants\u2019 cases were admissible in relation to Education Assistance Year (\u201cEAY\u201d) 2016/17 but \nobjected, at that time, to the remaining 102 Applicants in the Further Application on the basis that \nthey had either failed to substantiate to what extent the EA changes had adversely affected them \nor had signed separation arrangements agreeing to waive any and all claims arising from their \nemployment.   \n \n5 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n16.  On the same basis, the Respondent noted its willingness to find the Further Application \nadmissible for those Applicants once they had completed an internal administrative verification \nand  substantiated  the  extent  to  which  the  EA  changes  had  adversely  affected  them  when \nimplemented and applied to them. In later stages this was completed with \u201cagreed facts\u201d between \nthe parties submitted for 37 Applicants of the 964 Applicants who remained a part of the Further \nApplication.   \n \n17.  Pursuant  to  Rule  7  (6)  of  the  Tribunal\u2019s  Rules,  upon  receiving  the  Respondent\u2019s \nPreliminary Objections to the Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction, proceedings on the merits were suspended \nwhile the Tribunal considered the issue of admissibility. In Decision No. 112, the Tribunal ruled \nthat 37 of the 96 Applications were admissible, joined those cases, and ordered recommencement \nof consideration of the issues. The Tribunal deferred the matter related to costs until resolution on \nthe merits. \n \nProceedings since Decision No. 112 \n \n18.  In accordance with Decision No. 112, the Respondent submitted its Further Answer to \nApplicants\u2019 Further Application on 26 March 2018. On 9 April 2018 the Applicants submitted \ntheir Further Reply on behalf of the 37 Applicants and thereafter, on 17 April 2018, a Costs \nSchedule. On 25 April 2018 the Respondent submitted its Further Rejoinder. \n \n19.  In their Further Reply, the Applicants agreed with the Respondent in its Further Answer \nthat the written submissions already before the Tribunal addressed the relevant facts and applicable \nlegal framework. As such, the Tribunal was requested to read the Further Reply as a companion \nto the Applicants\u2019 original Application, Reply and Further Application. The Applicants requested \nan award of reasonable legal costs incurred since the issuance of Decision No. 109. One Applicant \nrequested anonymity pursuant to Tribunal Practice Direction No. 3 and asked that his name be \nredacted from Decision No. 112 at para. 47. \n \n                                                      \n4 Ninety-eight Applicants submitted their Observations on ADB\u2019s Preliminary Objections, eight Applicants having withdrawn.  \nSubsequent to that, two further Applicants withdrew. \n6 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n20.  On 21 May 2018 the Tribunal requested, pursuant to Rule 10 of the ADBAT Rules of \nProcedure, the Respondent to submit additional written statements of the annual gross salaries, \nallowances and deductions for years 2015, 2016 and 2017 for each of the Applicants. This was \nprovided on 1 June 2018 along with a request to ensure each statement was shared only with the \nApplicant named therein due to its sensitivity. \n \n21.  On 30 May 2018, the Applicants\u2019 Counsel informed the Tribunal secretariat by email that \n(a) one Applicant had withdrawn from the case (leaving 36 Applicants to whom the Further \nApplication applied); and (b) the remaining Applicants requested that their names be redacted from \nDecision No. 112 and \u201canonymized\u201d from the present judgment. The email noted that \u201ca number \nof Applicants have expressed concerns that the mere presence of their names is likely to be \nseriously prejudicial to them.\u201d It also noted that although Decision No. 112 had been \u201cout for some \nmonths\u201d this had \u201cno effect on the Applicants\u2019 request for anonymity, because what they seek is \nto avoid any issues further down the line.\u201d  \n \n22.  On 31 May 2018 the Executive Secretary of the Tribunal acknowledged the requests in the \nemail while at the same time asking the Applicants to \u201cformalize the request through a pleading \nfiled directly with the Tribunal \u2026 since reliefs sought under the Rules of Procedure must always \nbe contained in formal pleadings filed with the Tribunal so that they become part of the records of \nthe case.\u201d  The request was formalized by a pleading dated 27 June 2018. \n \nRelief Sought \n \n23.  The 36 Applicants request the Tribunal to: \n \n(i)  rescind the EA changes made (pursuant to Article X (1) and Rule 6 (3)(b)); \n \n(ii)  compensate for any losses suffered following the introduction of the EA changes, \nthereby putting Applicants back in the position they would have been in had the \nunlawful changes not been implemented by the Bank (pursuant to Article X (1)); and \n \n(iii)   award reasonable legal costs incurred by Applicants in the case, taking into account \nthe nature and complexity of the case and the nature and quality of the work \nperformed, pursuant to Article X (2). \n7 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n \n24.  The  Respondent  submits  that  the  Applicants\u2019  consent  was  not  required  to  alter  the \neducation benefits in the manner revised by the EA Changes, and that the EA Changes were \nintroduced in a manner consistent with Respondent\u2019s legal authority. Respondent requests the \nTribunal dismiss the Applicants\u2019 Further Application in its entirety. \n \nIII. FINDINGS \n \nPreliminary Matters \n \nConfidentiality and En Banc \n \n25.  Under Practice Direction No. 3 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure the Applicants have \nrequested that the details (i.e., the names) of the Applicants be redacted from this judgment. They \nalso requested that the Tribunal \u201canonymize\u201d in Decision No. 112 the 37 names that are listed at \nparagraph 47 of that judgment, a request that was not made before that Decision was issued. The \nApplicants submit that the fact that this second judgment has been out for some months would not \nhave an effect on the Applicants\u2019 request for anonymity, because what they were seeking was to \navoid any issues further down the line, so they asked for the current version of the published \njudgment to be taken down and replaced with a properly anonymized version. The Applicants \nsubmit that it is of critical importance that ordinary staff members perceive that the options for \nvindicating their rights are devoid of any opportunity for intimidation or retaliation. They added, \nto be clear, that they were not alleging that there have been instances of intimidation or retaliation, \nbut they felt that there might be risks in the future. \u201cAt its lowest\u201d, they felt that the inclusion of \ntheir names on the judgment(s) might result in prejudice to them. Given that redaction would not \ndisadvantage the Bank in any way, they considered their request both reasonable and proper. \nLastly, the administrative burden of redacting paragraph 47 of Decision No. 112 would be slight. \n \n26.  The Tribunal cannot agree with the reasoning behind the request. It, first of all, considers \nthat anonymity only has an impact for the public at large, and not for the Respondent who anyway \nknows who the Applicants are. Second, this reasoning would mean that it would have to be applied \n8 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nto  each  and  every  appeal.  The  Applicants  concede  that  there  have  not  been  instances  of \nintimidation or retaliation, but they feel that there are risks in the future. This is a serious, and \nunsubstantiated, insinuation of a real risk of retaliation, which the Tribunal may consider only if it \nis corroborated by facts and convincing arguments, and which would anyway not disappear by \nsimply \u201canonymizing\u201d Applicants\u2019 names. The Applicants have failed to provide any convincing \nelement in support of their submission. Nor does the Tribunal itself have any indication whatsoever \nof a current or future risk of retaliation, which would indeed be a major violation of basic principles \nunderlying the judicial process. In any event, according to Article IX, paragraph 1 of the Tribunal\u2019s \nStatute, \u201c[all] decisions of the Tribunal \u2026 shall be final and binding,\u201d and therefore a request for \nanonymity  cannot  be  granted  retroactively  concerning  an  earlier  Decision  that  is  final  and \npublished. The present proceedings cannot be used to correct an omission in the past. As a \nconsequence, the requests as presented cannot be granted. \n \n27.  On the other hand, the main purpose of the present proceedings is to establish the legality \nof the changes in the EA. Both parties have agreed to submit directly to the Tribunal a matter that \nis of interest to a great number of present and future staff. The purpose is not to identify individual \nstaff members and their private situations, and the Tribunal will maintain this approach throughout \nthis Decision. \n \n28.  In view of the complexity of the legal issues raised in the case, and in accordance with \nArticle V(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Statute read with Rule 5A of its Rules, the Tribunal deems it \nappropriate to consider the case en banc. \n \nAdmissibility \n \n29.  In its Decision No. 109 the Tribunal recalled that it has the power to rule only upon a staff \nmember\u2019s  claim  that  the  Bank  has  rendered  a  decision  that  violates  that  staff  member\u2019s \nemployment contract and that has directly and adversely affected him or her. (Decision No. 109, \npara. 47 citing Canlas, Decision No. 56 [2003] ADBAT Reports VI, 41 para. 20). \n \n9 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n30.  In its Decision No. 112 the Tribunal found that 37 Applicants had submitted financial \nsubstantiation concerning their claims of alleged actual financial losses for the EAY 2016/17.  \nFollowing the withdrawal by one Applicant, currently 36 Applicants are subject to the present \nDecision. \n \n31.  Further analysis of the data provided, however, shows that a number of the Applicants have \nnot been adversely affected by the new system and, in fact, received more or the same EA in EAY \n2016/17 than under the previous EA scheme. This is, for example, the case with Applicants who \nhave received tuition subsidy for pre-primary education, which did not exist before. Since they \nwere not adversely affected their claims are therefore inadmissible. \n \n32.  Equally, claims from Applicants who saw an increase of their EA in EAY 2016/2017 \nbecause of the application of the 80% phasing out scheme, or because of higher FRA, and of those \nwho did not see a change in their EA amounts, are inadmissible. \n \n33.  In so far as their claims relate to the future, these are also inadmissible, since the Tribunal, \nas it held in Decision No. 109, cannot deal with potential or hypothetical cases. \n \nThe Merits \n \n34.  Analysis of the cases that are retained as admissible shows that the actual alleged losses \nare limited to the FRA for non-tuition costs, such as board and lodging. Two changes were \nintroduced in this respect: (1) The allowance would no longer be calculated on the basis of a \npercentage of the school country limit but was set at 75% of the respective World Bank subsistence \ngrant for room and board, and (2) It would no longer be paid regarding dependants who live with \nrelatives; this is on the presumption that there are no, or substantially lower, non-tuition costs \ninvolved. \n \n35.  Four Applicants have, or had, one or more dependants living with relatives. The Tribunal \nobserves that neither the Application nor the Further Application, however, specifically challenges \n10 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nthe legality of this particular measure to abolish assistance for this category, nor have the \nApplicants concerned provided proof of financial harm.  \n \nA)  The Bank\u2019s power to make unilateral changes to terms and conditions \n \n36.  It is a well-established legal principle that the power to make rules implies in principle the \nright to amend them unilaterally. This power flows from the responsibilities of the competent \n \nauthorities of the Bank.5 ADB staff accept this principle when they sign the Affirmation upon \nAppointment. It is equally well established that there are limits to this power and that any changes \nmust be reasonable and must respect the essential and acquired rights of staff.6 \n \n37.  It is in this respect recalled that in Mesch and Siy (No. 3), Decision No. 18 [1996] II \nADBAT Reports, the Tribunal referred to its first Decision (Lindsey Decision No. 1 [1991] I \nADBAT Reports 5), where it outlined the principal rules of law within the framework of which \nthe facts must be considered: \n\u2026 \n19. In Lindsey, Decision No. 1 [1992], the Tribunal identified the principal rules of law \nwithin the framework of which the facts of a case must be considered:  \n \nIn addition to the constituent instruments of the Bank and of the Tribunal, as well \nas general principles of law, these rules are to be derived from the contract between \nthe Bank and the staff member, the Staff Rules and Regulations of the Bank, the \nPersonnel Handbooks for professional and support staff, and Administrative Orders \nand Circulars,  as  promulgated  and applied  from  time to  time, subject  to  the \nrecognition of any acquired right of the staff, and, by analogy, from the staff \npractices  of  international  organisations  generally,  including  the  decisions  of \ninternational administrative tribunals dealing with comparable situations. There is, \nin this sphere, a large measure of \u201ccommon\u201d law of international organisations to \nwhich, according to the circumstances, the Tribunal will give due weight. \n \n38.  Regarding the power to amend the terms of employment the Tribunal observed: \n\u2026 \n21. The power of an organization to amend the contract of employment or terms of \nappointment has been lucidly set out in de Merode, WBAT Reports 1981, Decision No. 1:  \n                                                      \n5 Cf. de Merode, WBAT Reports 1981, Decision No. 1, paragraph 31. \n6 Cf. Idem, paragraph 35. \n11 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n \n35.  [T]he Bank has the power unilaterally to change conditions of employment of \nthe staff. At the same time, significant limitations exist upon the exercise of such \npower.  \n....  \n40. \u2026 The Tribunal notes that [the distinction between unilateral amendments \nwhich are permissible and those which are not] cannot rest on the extent to which \na staff member accepted such power of amendment in his letter of appointment. \nEven if no reservation of the power of amendment were expressly included in the \nletters of appointment, such a power would be implied from the internal law of the \nBank. Likewise, even if those cases where a power of amendment is reserved in \nterms which impose no limitation upon its exercise, this cannot be construed to \naccord to the organization an unrestricted power of amendment. The scope of the \nwords as used in the exchange of letters must be read against the background of the \nBank's internal law, and it is not on the strength and extent of any individual's \nacceptance that the power of amendment and its limitations may be defined.  \n....  \n42. \u2026 Certain elements are fundamental and essential in the balance of rights and \nduties of the staff member; they are not open to any change without the consent of \nthe staff member affected. Others are less fundamental and less essential in this \nbalance; they may be unilaterally changed by the Bank in the exercise of its power, \nsubject to [certain] limits and conditions. ...  \n\u2026. \n44. \u2026 The Tribunal prefers not to invoke the phrase \u201cacquired rights\u201d in order to \ndescribe essential rights. \u2026 It is not because there is an acquired right that there is \nno power of unilateral  amendment.  It  is  rather because  certain  conditions of \nemployment are so essential and fundamental and, by reason thereof, unchangeable \nwithout the consent of the staff member, that one can speak of acquired rights. In \nother words, what one calls \u201cthe doctrine of acquired rights\u201d does not constitute the \ncause  or  justification  of  the  unchangeable  character  of  certain  conditions  of \nemployment. It is simply a handy expression of this unchangeable character, of \nwhich the cause and the justification are to be found in the fundamental and \nessential character of the relevant conditions of employment.  \n \n22.  Although some terms and conditions of employment can be prospectively altered, the \nprinciple that fundamental and essential terms and conditions of employment cannot \nunilaterally be amended is now a recognized principle which can be regarded as part of the \nlaw common to international organizations. That principle imposes a limitation on the \npowers  of  the  governing  bodies  of  every  international  organization,  restraining  the \nunilateral amendment of such terms and conditions\u2026  \n \nThe Tribunal concluded that it had competence to consider whether a decision of the Bank is a \nnullity because it purports to amend unilaterally a fundamental and essential term or condition of \nemployment. \n12 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n \n39.  And in Suzuki, Decision No. 82 [2008] VIII ADBAT Reports 59, the Tribunal held: \n \n26.  \u2026 The Bank clearly advised employees of the transitory nature of benefits and the \npotential for such change with the following provision in its handbook: \u201cThere is no \ndifference in the coverage and the benefits provided by the GMIP and PRGMIP in the \npresent plan.\u201d (emphasis supplied). \n \n27.  That reservation of the right to amend from time to time the terms of insurance for \nBank employees is consistent with rulings of other tribunals in other international agencies.  \nThe ILOAT in Dekker (No 3) ILOAT Judgment No. 1917 (3 February 2000) in para. 7 \ndecided  that  \u201cthe  complainant  has  no  specific  claim  to  a  specific  system  of  health \ninsurance\u201d noting that changes made did not violate any acquired right. Thus we find that \nthe details of coverage, charges and fees of the healthcare benefit under GMIP and \nPRGMIP in effect at any particular time are elements of a benefit which themselves are \nsubject to change, and that employees were advised of that prospect when the economics \nof the program so justified. We must conclude that the ADB did not breach any obligation \nincurred by the Bank to Mr. Suzuki at the time of his hire when it later extended that \nhealthcare program to pensioners with the potential for subsequent adjustment to retired \nemployees and their dependents. \n\u2026 \n32.  In examining changes \u2026 it is essential to assure that (i) the objective of such change \nis rational and legitimate, (ii) there is evidence to support the different treatment of various \nmember groups, (iii) there is a rational nexus between the classification of persons subject \nto the differential treatment and the objective of the classification, and (iv) the differential \ntreatment is proportionate to the objective of the change.\u201d (see Mr R v IMF, Judgment No. \n2002-1 [5 March, 2002]) \n\u2026 \n38.   In this case we find that the Bank\u2019s action is in conformity also with standards \nprescribed in De Merode, WBAT Decision No. 1 [1981], para. 88 where it showed that \n\u201cthis was not a hastily adopted reform but a change studied at length and most carefully \nprepared.\u201d The Bank after its earlier efforts in developing Decisions 1 and 2, investigated \nthe issues further and undertook consultation with staff and pensioners prior to the issuance \nof Decision 3. Although the pensioners as a group did not endorse the changes, we are \nsatisfied that the Bank enhanced the contributory role of those affected by the changes and \nthat the changes set forth benefited from such consultation. \n \n40.  It is opportune to quote another paragraph of de Merode here: \n41.   Nor can the distinction between what is permissible and what is impermissible rest on \nthe state of mind or the intentions of staff members at the time of taking their employment, \non their \u201cexpectations\u201d or \u201creliance\u201d or on the motivating factors which might have induced \nthem to accept or remain in employment with the Bank. Subjective considerations are at \nbest difficult to identify and the difficulty increases with time. The possibility exists that \n13 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \ndifferent considerations may prevail with different individuals, thus occasioning a diversity \nof  governing  rules  where  uniformity  is  necessary.  Moreover,  there  are  at  least  two \nsubjective intentions in any contract. There is no more reason to attach greater weight to \nthe intention of the staff member than to that of the Bank. Furthermore, staff members are \nentitled to the observance of their conditions of employment as they may exist from time \nto time, and not only of those terms of appointment which induced them to accept service \nwith the Bank and on the maintenance of which they have placed their \u201cexpectations\u201d and \ntheir \u201creliance\u201d. In entering the service of the Bank, the staff member expects, or should \nexpect, that these elements may be altered in the future to take account of changing \ncircumstances. \n \n41.  The Tribunal will in the present case maintain this approach and reasoning.  \n \nB)  Did the Bank breach a fundamental and essential term of contract by introducing the EA \nchanges? \n \n42.  The Applicants argue that the right to receive the EA is a fundamental and essential term \nof contract and, as such, cannot be unilaterally altered by the Bank. They submit that this is the \ncase because the EA was included as a well-defined undertaking when the Applicants accepted \ntheir posts with the ADB. They contend that the EA changes made on 1 January 2016 without the \nApplicants\u2019 consent abolished \u201ca substantial portion of the Applicants\u2019 fundamental and essential \nrights\u201d and is contrary to international administrative law. \n \n43.  They submit that the EA has the quality of being \u201cessential\u201d because it was included as a \nspecific and well-defined undertaking when the Applicants accepted their post, induced staff into \nemployment, and was relied on when staff made the decision to join. They allege that prospective \nstaff were clearly told by BPMSD that the ADB\u2019s benefits were the real long-term benefit of \njoining ADB and, in many cases, this was followed up with written information confirming the \nbenefits available. \n \n44.  The Applicants also contend that the EA changes, such as limiting tertiary education \nbenefits to four years post-secondary compared to when the dependant turns 24 years old, and \nreducing the FRA, involve the elimination or abolition of substantial chunks of the EA. They allege \npotential social hardship as well as negative financial impact. \n14 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n \n45.  The Applicants submit that they had a legitimate expectation that the EA would continue \nunchanged. They argue that such an expectation may arise, even where the Staff Rules and \nRegulations  explicitly  reserve  a  right  of  change.  Accordingly,  the  doctrine  of  \u201cpromissory \nestoppel\u201d should apply and the ADB should be estopped from applying changes that would be \ninconsistent with the Applicants\u2019 legitimate expectation that the EA would continue to be operated \non the basis of the EA with an income equivalent to what they signed up for. \n \n46.  In Reply to the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the implementation of the benefits was not \nfundamental, the Applicants argue that changing the very components that make up a fundamental \nand essential term goes beyond a change in its implementation.  \n \n47.  The Respondent submits that (1) the EA changes did not alter any \u201cfundamental and \nessential\u201d term(s) of the Applicants\u2019 employment; and (2) the Respondent had the legal authority \nto exercise its discretion to unilaterally revise the implementation of the education grant policy \nthat resulted in the EA changes, and did so in a manner consistent with limitations comprising the \nde Merode criteria.   \n \n48.  The Respondent contends that the provision of education grants to International Staff is \nfundamental and essential in principle but not in implementation and that it has legal authority and \ndiscretion to revise the terms and conditions of staff benefits from time to time without the \nApplicants\u2019 consent. It submits that the Application invites the Tribunal to depart from well-\nestablished jurisprudence regarding the judicial deference to the authority of an international \norganization to amend the terms and conditions of employment. \n \n49.  As the Tribunal mentioned supra, reasonable education assistance is an important and \nessential part of the compensation package for International Staff. Abolition of it, for example, \nwould touch on an essential right and would, most likely, require consent of the staff member \nconcerned. But that is not the case here. The EA has not been abolished; it has been reviewed, as \nit has been several times before, which in itself constitutes a significant precedent showing that the \n15 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nassistance package was not sacrosanct and could be modified from time to time.7 Moreover, the \nemployment contracts specify that staff are expected to comply with present and future regulations. \nRegulations in force at the moment of recruitment were attached to the contract.  \n \n50.  A new balance was struck in 2015 in the overall compensation package for all staff, \nincluding the EA package for International Staff, in order to meet the Bank\u2019s stated objectives \nwhile  keeping  the  compensation  package  attractive  for  recruitment  and  retention  of  highly \nqualified staff.  \n \n51.  The Bank\u2019s International Staff was, and remains, entitled to education assistance. While \nthe EA may be a fundamental and essential element of the Applicants\u2019 terms of appointment, the \nsame can, however, not be said concerning the details thereof.8 The employment contracts do not \nspecify any details of the EA and staff concerned thus do not have a claim to specific details of \nthis assistance. The normative texts in this respect are formulated in general terms. Section 14 of \nthe Staff Regulations provides that  \n\u201cStaff members may be entitled to  dependency allowance  and education grants  in \naccordance with the Administrative Orders \u2026\u201d  \n \nand AO 3.06 paragraph 1, states: \n \n\u201cIt is the policy of ADB to provide education assistance to international staff members \n\u2026 towards costs of educating their dependent children\u2026.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n \nThey do not guarantee specific amounts or a particular level of assistance, nor do they state that \nthese cannot be subject to any change. \n \n52.  The details of the EA are therefore not part of those fundamental elements of the \nApplicants\u2019 conditions of employment that require consent of the staff for changes thereto.9 \n                                                      \n7 Cf. Idem, note 5, paragraph 78. \n8 Cf. Idem, paragraph 77. \n9 Cf. In Re Andres (No. 2), ILOAT Judgment No. 726 (1986), paragraph 15: \n[t]hough the staff member may have an acquired right to an allowance, he will not necessarily have an acquired right to \nthe method of reckoning it or to the actual amount. \nSee. also In re Settino, ILOAT Judgment No. 426 (1980), consideration 7: \nThe right to salary and to the well-established allowances, such as those for dependants, is essentially a fundamental \n16 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n \n53.  As a consequence, the Tribunal concludes that there was no violation of essential rights \nrequiring the explicit consent of the staff concerned. \n \nC) Did the Bank amend the EA in a manner inconsistent with its legal obligations or did the Bank \nabuse its powers? \n \n54.  Having arrived at the conclusion that the EA changes did not violate essential rights, the \nTribunal now needs to verify whether the EA changes violate any other rights of the Applicants, \nsuch as acquired rights that are not essential rights, or violate any other legal obligations of the \nBank. This Tribunal considers it not necessary to enter into a semantic discussion concerning \nessential rights or acquired rights, or other rights, when reviewing the present case. The Tribunal \ndeems it useful to recall fundamental jurisprudence in this respect. Besides, parties have used these \nrespective notions throughout the pleadings. \n \n55.  In addition, the Tribunal must review whether the procedures leading to the changes have \nbeen correctly followed or whether the EA changes were made in a manner inconsistent with the \nBank\u2019s legal obligations. It will, in line with Suzuki, in particular need to review whether (i) the \nobjective of the changes is rational and legitimate, (ii) there is evidence to support the different \ntreatment of various member groups, (iii) there is a rational nexus between the classification of \npersons subject to the differential treatment and the objective of the classification, and (iv) the \ndifferential treatment is proportionate to the objective of the change. See Suzuki, Decision No. \n82 [2008] VIII ADBAT Reports 59, para. 32. \n \n                                                      \nright. But this does not mean that every item making up the salary or allowance and every detail of the process by which \nit is calculated are to be deemed inviolate\u2026 \nAnd In re Elsen and Elsen-Drouot, ILOAT Judgment No. 368 (1979), consideration 7: \nIt is quite clear that expatriation, education and leave expense allowances are matters of importance to someone who \njoins the staff of an international organisation. The question therefore arises whether the outright abolition of such \nallowances would in principle violate an acquired right. There is, however, no acquired right to the amount and the \nconditions of payment of such allowances. Indeed the staff member should expect amendments to be prompted by \nchanges in circumstances if, for example, the cost of living rises or falls, or the organisation reforms its structure, or even \nfinds itself in financial difficulty. Hence the reduction in the expatriation allowance paid to the complainants does not \ninfringe any right which was of decisive importance to them in accepting appointment and which may be regarded as \nacquired. Moreover, there is no clause in their contract which even tacitly guaranteed them any such right. The plea that \nacquired rights were infringed therefore fails.  \n17 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n56.  The Applicants argue that even if the Tribunal finds that the EA does not amount to an \nessential and fundamental right, the ADB did not amend it in a manner consistent with its legal \nobligations, which are that the changes must (1) not be retroactive; (2) be based on a proper \nconsideration of the relevant facts; (3) be reasonably related to the underlying objective for the \nchange; (4) be proposed in good faith and not prompted by improper motive; (5) not discriminate \nin an unjustifiable manner; and (6) be proposed in a reasonable manner to avoid excessive and \nunnecessary harm. The Tribunal will also take these elements, which are in fact similar to those \nmentioned in the previous paragraph, into account when reviewing the impugned decision. \n \n57.  Lastly, the Applicants submit that the ADB did not carry out meaningful consultations \nwith its employees and that instead the process was artificial and feigned.  \n \n58.  The  Respondent  notes  that  this  Tribunal  has  clearly  recognized  an  international \norganization\u2019s authority to alter unilaterally the \u201cnon-fundamental and non-essential\u201d terms of \nemployment, even in cases where such revision leads to a reduction in entitlements. It contends \nthat after the EA changes were introduced, the Bank has continued to provide a reasonable level \nof education grants to its eligible International Staff, consistent with their fundamental and \nessential terms of employment. It concludes that the changes are not retroactive, are based on the \nproper consideration of the relevant facts, are reasonably related to the objective they were \nintended to achieve, were determined in good faith and not prompted by improper motives, do \nnot discriminate, and were proposed in a reasonable manner seeking to avoid excessive and \nunnecessary harm to the staff.  \n \n(i) \u201cAcquired\u201d Rights \n \n59.  International administrative tribunals regularly refer to the principle of \u201cacquired rights\u201d. \nIt is also a notion that has evolved over time. \n \n60.  The International Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT), for example, \n18 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \ngave precisions on its approach in its Judgment No. 83210: \n13.  In Judgment 61 (in re Lindsey) the Tribunal held that the amendment of a rule to an \nofficial's detriment and without his consent amounts to breach of an acquired right when \nthe structure of the contract of appointment is disturbed or there is impairment of any \nfundamental  term  of  appointment  in  consideration  of  which  the  official  accepted \nappointment. \n  \n\u2026 \nSo before ruling on the plea the Tribunal must in each case determine whether the altered \nterm is fundamental and essential.  \n \n14.  There are three tests it will apply.  \n \nThe first is the nature of the altered term. It may be in the contract or in the Staff \nRegulations or Staff Rules or in a decision, and whereas the contract or a decision may give \nrise to acquired rights the regulations and rules do not necessarily do so.  \n \nThe second test is the reason for the change. It is material that the terms of appointment \nmay often have to be adapted to circumstances, and there will ordinarily be no acquired \nright when a rule or a clause depends on variables such as the cost-of-living index or the \nvalue  of  the  currency.  Nor  can  the  finances  of  the  body  that  applies  the  terms  of \nappointment be discounted.  \n \nThe third test is the consequence of allowing or disallowing an acquired right. What effect \nwill the change have on staff pay and benefits? And how do those who plead an acquired \nright fare as against others?  \n \n61.  The ILOAT reconfirmed its approach recently in Judgment No. 390911 as follows: \n \n12.    As  the  Tribunal  pointed  out  in  Judgment  3876,  consideration  7,  international \norganisations\u2019 staff members are not entitled to have all the conditions of employment or \nretirement laid down in the provisions of the staff rules and regulations in force at the time \nof their recruitment applied to them throughout their career and retirement. Most of those \nconditions  can be  altered during or after an  employment  relationship as a result of \namendments to those provisions, irrespective of whether the staff member\u2019s appointment \nis permanent or temporary, as in the complainant\u2019s case.  \nThe Tribunal has consistently held that the position is of course different if, having regard \nto the nature and importance of the provision in question, the complainant has an acquired \nright to its continued application. However, the amendment of a provision governing an \nofficial\u2019s situation to her or his detriment constitutes a breach of an acquired right only \nwhen such an amendment adversely affects the balance of contractual obligations, or alters \n                                                      \n10 In re Ayoub, Lucal, Monat, Perret-Nguyen and Samson, ILOAT Judgment No. 832 (1987). \n11 d.O.M v. OTIF, ILOAT Judgment No. 3909 (2018). \n19 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nfundamental terms of employment in consideration of which the official accepted an \nappointment, or which subsequently induced her or him to stay on. In order for there to be \na breach of an acquired right, the amendment to the applicable text must therefore relate to \na fundamental and essential term of employment within the meaning of Judgment 832 (see, \nfor example, Judgments 2089, 2682, 2986 or 3135). \n \n62.  The  distinction  between  essential  and  non-essential  rights,  fundamental  and  non-\nfundamental rights, or between acquired rights and other rights, or what upsets the balance of the \ncontract and what does not, does not depend on staff members\u2019 subjective expectations or on \nfactors that might have induced them to accept or remain in employment with the Bank. This is \neven more pertinent for staff who have fixed-term contracts or who started employment with the \nBank when they did not, or did not yet, have children. \n \n(ii) The Tribunal\u2019s scope of review with regard to managerial decisions in general \n \n63.  It is appropriate in this context to, first of all, recall that \u201cthe Tribunal cannot say that the \nsubstance of a policy decision is sound or unsound.  It can only say that the decision has or has not \nbeen  reached  by  the  proper  processes,  or  that  the  decision  either  is  or  is  not  arbitrary, \ndiscriminatory, or improperly motivated, or that it is one that could or could not reasonably have \nbeen taken on the basis of facts accurately gathered and properly weighed\u201d. See Decision No. 1, \nLindsey, [1991], I ADBAT Reports 5, paragraph 12. But the Tribunal must first review whether \nthe changes were made according to the principles raised in paras. 55-57 as discussed below. \n \n(iii) Is the objective of the changes rational and legitimate and are the EA changes reasonably \nrelated to the underlying objective for the change?  \n \n64.  As  was  mentioned  supra,  the  EA  changes  were  introduced  following  a  regular \nquinquennial review of ADB\u2019s compensation and benefits package, which took place in the \ncontext of the ADB\u2019s 2020 Strategy and the related \u201cOur People Strategy\u201d, and which emphasized \nthe need to provide a package of remuneration and benefits that are competitive in the international \nmarketplace and in each location where the Bank operates.  \n \n65.  The objectives of the 2015 Comprehensive Review were explained to staff to include, \n20 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \namongst others: (i) assessment of the competitiveness of the Bank\u2019s compensation and benefits \npolicies with reference to global or local employment markets from which the Bank recruits its \nstaff; (ii) assessment of sustainability and cost efficiency of ADB\u2019s compensation and benefits \npolicies and its effectiveness in supporting talent acquisition, staff development and retention; and \n(iii) identification of areas where changes in the staffing, compensation and benefits policies are \nrequired to support the Bank\u2019s business needs and changing workforce demographics. \n \n66.  The Bank was also seeking to ensure that the compensation and benefits were consistent \nwith the Bank\u2019s mission of eradicating poverty and supporting poor people in the region; to pay \nattention to greater equity amongst staff so as not to overemphasize benefits of IS with children in \nhigher education; and to bring the benefits more in line with its comparators such as other \nInternational Financial Institutions. \n \n67.  The Applicants contend that the underlying objective for the EA changes, i.e. to reduce the \nprevious EA benefits to a level more appropriate for a development bank, and to \u201cshare out\u201d the \nbenefits more equitably among staff including those without children, is not valid. They submit \nthat neither of these reasons comprises a valid objective for making the EA changes without staff\u2019s \nconsent.  \n \n68.  The Tribunal considers the stated objectives appropriate and valid. They are rational and \nlegitimate. It is recalled that the overall compensation package was reviewed, resulting in some \nnegative and positive changes in the EA for some staff, but a salary increase for all staff. \n \n69.  The Tribunal does not see any evidence that by adopting the package as it did, the Bank \nabused any of the discretionary powers or violated any of its responsibilities and obligations vis-\n\u00e0-vis the staff.  \n \n(iv)  Are the changes based on proper consideration of the relevant facts? \n \n70.

They also claim that no evidence \nwas provided to staff to demonstrate the following: (a) that the level of EA had ceased to reflect \nthe costs of educating children at secondary or tertiary level; (b) that the SCL was not appropriate; \n(c) that the revised limits for tuition or flat rate allowance were appropriate; (d) that the ADB has \na firm understanding of what goes into the factors which constitute the SCL or the World Bank \nGroup Subsistence Grant for Room and Board; and (e) why the EA should now be 75% of the \nWorld Bank Group Subsistence Grant for Room and Board when the World Bank applies 100%. \n \n71.  The Respondent contends that the EA changes were the result of a thorough review \nundertaken in the context of the 2015 Comprehensive Review and included the findings of an \ninternationally recognized consulting firm specializing in expatriate salaries and benefits that \ninformed the Respondent\u2019s discussions with its staff over an eight-month period. \n \n72.  The review role of the Tribunal in this respect is limited. It is not its role to entertain each \nelement underpinning, or not, the proposed and retained changes. That is the role of management: \nto be informed, make assessments, retain options, make proposals and consult with staff and their \nrepresentatives about them. The Tribunal is persuaded that the record amply shows that this is \nwhat has happened. The Respondent gathered detailed relevant facts through a consulting firm, \nanalyzed them and relied on them. The Applicants may question the facts or the analysis thereof, \nbut they have not established that the Respondent acted improperly in this respect or abused its \npowers. It was by a reasoned judgment and after a balance of considerations that the Bank preferred \none formula to another, being conscious that none could be perfect in all respects.12 \n \n(v) Were the changes proposed in good faith and not prompted by improper motive? \n \n73.  The Applicants contend bad faith on the part of the Respondent since at no stage was it \nintimated when joining the Bank that they should be aware that Management was at liberty at any \ntime to take away parts of the EA. They relied on the continuation of these benefits and find that \nthe reasons given for the EA changes lack honesty and transparency.  \n \n                                                      \n12 Cf. de Merode, paragraph 76. \n22 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n74.  The Respondent reiterates that the changes were the product of the 2015 Comprehensive \nReview and were introduced in the context of overall revisions to the Bank\u2019s compensation and \nbenefits. They were not introduced without context, or without due consideration, and they were \ndirectly related to their underlying objective. The Respondent argues that the Applicants have \nfailed to establish that the EA changes emanated from improper motives. \n \n75.  The Tribunal has already concluded supra that the Bank has the power, under certain \nconditions, to unilaterally amend employment conditions and that the terms of appointment did \nnot guarantee benefits indefinitely or without change. The amounts have varied during the staff\u2019s \nemployment so far. They have signed a declaration that they accept that employment conditions \nmay be changed. Normative texts provide the same. Moreover, practice over the years shows that \nthe compensation package and the EA package have been reviewed and revised regularly. In \nentering the service of the Bank, the staff member expects, or should expect, that these elements \nmay be altered in the future to take account of changing circumstances.13 \n \n(vi)  Do the EA changes have retroactive effect? \n \n76.  The  Applicants  submit  that  changing  education  benefits  constitutes  a  retroactive \namendment to the staff members\u2019 terms of conditions of employment laid down in contracts that \ndo already exist.  \n \n77.  The Respondent\u2019s position is that the EA changes did not have retroactive effect as these \nrights did not accrue based on past service (unlike benefits under the Staff Retirement Plan (SRP)). \nStaff members must meet the conditions for entitlement at the relevant time upon application for \nthe grant in the applicable EAY. \n \n78.  The Tribunal has already concluded that the Bank has the power, under certain conditions, \nto amend unilaterally employment conditions and that the terms of appointment did not guarantee \ndetails of benefits indefinitely. It further observes that the changes were introduced with effect \nfrom 1 January 2016, i.e. in the middle of an education year. It is perhaps not advisable to introduce \n                                                      \n13 Cf. de Merode, paragraph 41. \n23 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nchanges in the middle of an education year, as the new measures also applied to the first semester \nof the academic year, i.e. a number of months preceding 1 January 2016. On the other hand, \nentitlement to the EA and the final calculation thereof can be established only at the end of the \nacademic year when staff can provide all the data and documents in support of their claims. The \nTribunal observes that the EA changes were part of a change in the overall remuneration package, \nincluding a salary increase. The Tribunal notes that, while the EA changes were introduced during \nthe academic year, the Applicants have not shown that the limited retroactivity caused any \nfinancial hardship. \n \n(vii)  Is there different treatment of various groups of staff or do the changes discriminate in an \nunjustifiable manner?  \n \n79.  The Applicants allege that the EA changes are discriminatory since they are retroactive in \nnature and their impact depends on factors such as how old employees\u2019 children are and what \ncourses they study. They also submit that some staff had made prospective plans and committed \nthemselves. \n \n80.  The Respondent argues that the principle of non-discrimination requires an organization to \ntreat similarly situated staff members fairly. It does not require the Respondent to treat all staff \nmembers identically. It also argues that no impermissible discrimination exists between staff \nmembers with regard to EA Changes, since all International Staff are subject to the same rules. \n \n81.  The Tribunal holds that the EA provisions, both  old  and new, apply  equally to  all \nInternational Staff and that similarly situated staff are treated in the same way. The reimbursement \namounts themselves obviously differ per child, depending on a variety of factors, such as age, level \nof studies, place of studies, costs of studies, scholarships, only to name a few. This does, however, \nnot amount to improper discrimination, as the Applicants submit.    \n \n(viii) Are the changes proportionate to the objective of the change? Are the changes reasonable \nand do they avoid excessive and unnecessary harm? \n \n24 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n82.  The Applicants contend that even with the four-year transition period, the majority of the \nApplicants cannot save enough to compensate for the changes, particularly those Applicants on \nlower salary scales or with more than two children. They submit that the changes result in, for \nexample, a staff member at level 4 suffering the same reduction in income as a staff member at \ndirector level or above. They conclude that this causes excessive harm to staff, particularly those \nat lower levels. \n \n83.  The Respondent considers that providing financial support to International Staff for a \nperiod of four years of tertiary education for their eligible dependents is reasonable and consistent \nwith its policy, as it is sufficient to achieve a reasonable level of tertiary education. It underscored \nthat it did not guarantee eligible dependants any number of years of tertiary education but instead \neligibility up to the age of 24. It notes that when education grants were first introduced eligible \ndependants were under the age of 22 years. This was increased only to allow for \u201cprogression loss\u201d \nof children when transferring to schools in Manila. It also notes that the method for calculating the \nFRA was changed, as the old method was deemed no longer appropriate for achieving its purpose \nof providing a reasonable allowance to assist International Staff in meeting non-tuition related \nexpenses. The FRA had been increasing at a rate faster than the rate of the actual cost of living. \n \n84.  The Respondent further argues that the changes included (1) an increase in the maximum \ntuition subsidy cap; (2) continued flexibility to eligible dependants in pursuing tertiary studies; (3) \nno effect on primary/secondary school options for staff stationed in resident missions where \noptions can be challenging; (4) phasing in over a four-year period to ameliorate the financial \nimpact and provide a reasonable time to consider all tertiary education options; (5) a limited impact \non  dependant\u2019s pursuing tertiary studies beyond four years, as on average, over the last five years \nonly about 20 eligible dependants in any EAY (or 7.5% of eligible dependants) pursued tertiary \neducation beyond four years; and (6) immediate elimination of the FRA for those dependants who \nreside with family members, which was not excessively harmful as they were not incurring the \nnon-tuition related costs that were intended to be covered by the FRA. \n \n85.  The Tribunal, first of all, observes that at this stage the new limit of financial support for a \nperiod of four years of tertiary education has not been applied to any of the Applicants and this \n25 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nmatter is therefore hypothetical. Moreover, this measure is subject to a staggered phasing-in \nperiod. \n \n(ix)  Should the EA changes have been \u201cgrandfathered\u201d? \n \n86.  The Applicants submit that the lawful and appropriate way for the President to achieve his \nobjectives of recasting the benefits so that they are reduced and/or more equitably distributed \namong the entire staff is to \u201cgrandfather\u201d the benefits.  \n \n87.  The Respondent contends that it is not legally obligated to \u201cgrandfather\u201d or \u201clock in\u201d a \nnon-fundamental or non-essential benefit at the level prevailing when a relevant staff member \ncommences employment. \n \n88.  The Respondent submits that, as noted in de Merode, an organization retains the authority \nto decide whether new/revised rules will apply immediately to staff members of an organization \nalready employed, and staff members should expect such revisions from time to time. In the \ncontext of the EA Changes, management judged that grandfathering the pre-2016 education grants \nfor existing staff would have led to further inequity between staff on board prior to the EA Changes \nand those who joined after their introduction. It also decided that in light of the underlying \nobjectives, it was fair and equitable for all International Staff to be governed by the same rules and \nthat the four-year transition period was a reasonable period for International Staff to make the \nadjustment. \n \n89.  The Tribunal agrees that there is no automatic entitlement to \u201cgrandfathering\u201d in the \npresent case. It is also persuaded that the Bank pursued a reasonable objective and did not abuse \nits powers when it decided not to \u201cgrandfather\u201d.   \n  \n(x) Did the EA changes upset the economic balance of the contract? \n \n90.  Analysis of the data provided shows that between 2015 and 2017, the Applicants received \nincreases in their basic salaries of, on average, five per cent per year. The total income of salary \n26 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nand allowances of 27 of the 36 Applicants did not decrease in the 2015 \u2013 2017 period. It should be \nadded that fluctuations, upwards or downwards, in allowances were not only due to changes in the \nEA. Some Applicants saw their total income evolve following changes in the housing assistance \nor in the Outside Duty Station Allowance. Other Applicants saw their EA going down, for reasons \nsuch  as  children  graduating,  interrupting  studies  to  do  their  military  service,  or  receiving \nscholarships. The Applicant with the largest \u201closs\u201d (4,4%) fell into this category, by having had \nhis child leave for military service \n \n91.  The data provided also shows that the adverse impact, if any, is on average one per cent of \na staff member\u2019s basic salary per child. Obviously, someone with more children is affected more, \nbut the impact is still not large.  The actual \u201closses\u201d for staff in the 2016/17 academic year thus \nrepresent a small percentage of the total EA, as well as of the total remuneration of each staff \nmember. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the changes are proportionate and reasonable and do \nnot cause excessive harm. The Applicants have not established such harm and have also not \nestablished that the newly calculated FRA rates do not provide major assistance regarding real \nnon-tuition costs. The FRA is a flat rate and not a direct, and partial, reimbursement of incurred \ncosts. In order to establish whether the new FRA rates are reasonable assistance or not, one would \nneed to verify what the actual and unavoidable costs really are in this respect and, as a corollary, \nwhat any outstanding costs remain for the staff member after the deduction of the grant.  \n \n92.  Lastly, the notion of \u201cupsetting the balance of the contract\u201d involves a much more \nsignificant realignment of the employment relationship than has occurred here. The decrease in \nEA cannot reasonably be considered as upsetting the economic balance of the relationship that \nApplicants had and still have with the Bank.  \n \n93.  The Tribunal notes that the decisions impugned may have an impact in the future. But that \nis of itself not enough to establish breach of an acquired right.14  \n \n94.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  negative  impact  of  the  disputed  measures  was \nsubstantially cushioned by the introduction of a staggered phasing-in period of four years. This \n                                                      \n14 Cf. ILOAT, Judgment No. 832, consideration 15. \n27 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nallows staff members to anticipate and take adequate measures, whenever necessary and possible, \nfor future academic years.  \n \n95.  The Tribunal repeats that it is the stated purpose of the EA to provide education assistance \nto International Staff towards meeting costs of educating their dependent children. Assistance \ntowards costs does not amount to income, as the Applicants implied. \n \n(xi)  Was there lack of proper consultations with staff and their representatives? \n \n96.  Lastly,  the  Applicants  submit  as  a  compounding  factor  that  there  was  no  proper \nconsultation with the staff or their representatives. They refer to human rights texts and underscore \nthe need to hold bona fide consultations with staff before adopting a decision, to have sufficient \ntime for consultation, and to provide adequate documentation to enable staff to understand the \nnature of and the rationale for the proposed changes. They conclude that the consultation was \n\u201cartificial and feigned.\u201d  \n \n97.  They argue in particular that the Bank did not allow sufficient time for consultations, that \nthe Bank did not provide staff with adequate documentation or financial analysis to enable them \nto understand the changes, that the decision to change had already been taken and was presented \nas a \u201cfait accompli\u201d, and that the changes made to the original proposal after receiving staff \nfeedback is not evidence of a valid consultation process given that it merely changed flagrantly \nunlawful proposals to less flagrant but still unlawful proposals. \n \n98.  The Respondent submits that it undertook extensive and lengthy consultations with staff \nand other stakeholders at every stage of the process that led to the approval of the EA changes.  It \nnotes that feedback from the consultations led to significant revisions and in some cases, deferral \nof the proposed changes (such as to the SRP and Group Medical Insurance Plan). In this regard it \nnotes that the changes were not hastily adopted but resulted in careful consideration following \nadequate and meaningful consultations. \n \n28 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n99.  The Tribunal observes that the issue at stake is limited to the question whether the Bank \nproperly followed the consultation procedure under its rules and did not violate any of its legal \nobligations. Applicants do not refer to any specific staff rule or regulation or provision that has \nallegedly been violated.  \n \n100.  Genuine consultation in good faith is indeed good management practice. The record amply \nshows that the Bank more than adequately respected its obligations, in particular under AO No. \n2.02 (\u201cPersonnel Policy Statement and Duties, Rights and Responsibilities of Staff Members\u201d), to \nconsult with the staff through their representatives. Numerous meetings were held, including town \nhall meetings and proposals were communicated. Staff Council was allowed to have its counsel \naddress all staff, etc. Following all this, substantial changes were made to the initial proposals. The \nright to consultation, however, does not entail an obligation on the part of the Bank to accept all \nthe proposals made by the staff and their representatives. The Applicants have failed to establish \nthat the extensive consultations were not held by the Bank in good faith. Accordingly, the plea \nfails. \n \n101.  To sum up, the Tribunal finds that the Bank did not violate any essential or acquired rights \nof the Applicants or act in breach of its obligations towards its staff.  \n \nIV.  RELIEF \n \n102.  In the Further Reply, the Applicants again request  an award of reasonable costs in \naccordance with Article X (2) of the Tribunal\u2019s Statute and taking into account the \u201cnature and \ncomplexity of the case and the nature and quality of the work performed.\u201d The Applicants, having \nbeen denied their request for an award of costs in Decision No. 109, ask that the Bank refund those \ncosts incurred since Decision No. 109. On 17 April 2018 the Applicants submitted a Costs \nSchedule in the amount of \u00a312,525 as proof of the legal costs incurred since receipt of Decision \nNo. 109 (i.e. from May 2017 onwards). \n \n103.  The  Applicants  assert  that  even  if  the  Tribunal  rejects  the  Further  Application,  the \nRespondent ought to pay for the Applicants\u2019 legal costs incurred in successfully reaching the \n29 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \nmerits phase of the proceedings, as the Respondent was unsuccessful in preventing the merits of \nthe case from reaching the Tribunal. The Applicants note that the Respondent did not file \npreliminary objections after the Application was lodged but only after the filing of the Further \nApplication. The Applicants note that in Decision No. 112, the Tribunal viewed the Respondent\u2019s \nfiling of preliminary objections to its jurisdiction at that stage as \u201ca complication in expediting \nproceedings.\u201d The Respondent has had the opportunity to comment on this statement in its Further \nRejoinder. \n \n104.  The Respondent opposes the Applicants\u2019 request for costs and asserts they should be \ndenied. The Respondent notes that the Article X (2) of the ADBAT Statute states that Applicants \nare only entitled to reasonable costs incurred if \u201can application is well-founded in whole or in \npart.\u201d It asserts that the rules do not provide for the award of legal costs in the event of an \nunsuccessful application.  \n \n105.  The Respondent argues that in any event, the request is not well-founded.  It notes that it \nhad no option but to file a Preliminary Objection when the Applicants failed to provide the relevant \ndocumentation in support of their claim in the Applicant\u2019s Further Application. It adds that, even \nthen, the Tribunal upheld Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection with respect to 59 of the 102 \nApplicants. \n \n106.  It is settled jurisprudence that this Tribunal may award reasonable legal fees and costs \npursuant to Article X (2) of the ADBAT Statute, which provides: \n \nIf the Tribunal concludes that an application is well-founded in whole or in part, it may \norder that the reasonable costs incurred by the applicant in the case, including the cost of \napplicant\u2019s counsel, be totally or partially borne by the Bank, taking into account the nature \nand complexity of the case, the nature and quality of the work performed, and the amount \nof the fees in relation to prevailing rates. \n \nIn addition, proof of costs must be provided: \n \nFrom its inception (Lindsey, Decision No. 1 [1992], I ADBAT Reports), the Tribunal has \nstressed that an applicant\u2019s Reply must contain proof of his costs. (Galang, Decision No. \n30 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n55 [2002], VI ADBAT Reports, para. 50). \n \nThe Tribunal notes that only part of costs has been provided. \n  \n107.  The Tribunal has also noted that although an applicant may succeed only in part, where \nissues raised are of importance the Tribunal has considered it equitable to award costs: \n   \n\u201cAlthough the Applicants have not succeeded on the merits, their pleadings nonetheless \nwere very useful to the tribunal on issues that were important and complex, and the \nApplicants did prevail with regard to the preliminary objections. Accordingly, the Tribunal \ndecides to award a sum towards their costs.\u201d (Mesch and Siy (No. 4), Decision No. 35 \n[1997], III ADBAT Reports, para. 51.  See also De Armas et al., Decision No. 39 [1998], \nIV ADBAT Reports, para. 93.) \n \n108.  The Tribunal deems it totally proper and important that staff have the possibility to \nchallenge the legality of changes to underlying general rules that apply or may apply to many \npresent and future staff. The Applicants and the Respondent agreed to submit the case directly to \nthe Tribunal in order to obtain a ruling on the legality of the measures in the interest of legal \ncertainty. Accordingly, the Respondent initially did not raise preliminary objections. \n \n109.  Having considered the representation of the parties, the criteria set out in Article X (2), and \nthe Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence, the Tribunal considers that the Applicants have raised a significant \nissue in law that had the potential to affect a much wider group of staff regarding their fundamental \nand essential rights. \n \n110.  It must at the same time be underlined, as the history of the present case shows, that some \nof the costs were avoidable. Time and resources were lost following inadequate preparation and \npresentation of the applications. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Applicants\u2019 pleadings were \nassisted in great part by the Respondent\u2019s voluntary provision of relevant documentation in support \nof their claims. The Tribunal considers that under these circumstances an amount of US$ 10,000 \nis a fair contribution towards costs. \n \n \n31 \nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal ", "Decision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v.
