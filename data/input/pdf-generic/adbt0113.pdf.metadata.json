Proceedings \n\non the merits had been suspended while objections to jurisdiction were considered in Perrin, et al. \n\n(No. 2), ADBAT Decision No. 112 (28 February 2018).  In Decision No. 112 the Tribunal upheld \n\nthe Bank\u2019s preliminary objections for 59 Applications while joining the remaining 37 Applications \n\nit considered admissible.   \n\n \n\n2. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nThe  EA  changes  were  part  of  a  broader  revision  of  ADB\u2019s  compensation  and  benefits \n\npackage that was applicable to International Staff, National Staff, and Administrative Staff at all \n\nduty  stations  including  Headquarters.  These  changes  were  implemented  in  the  context  of  the \n\nRespondent\u2019s 2020 Strategy. After an almost year-long consultation period, these final changes \n\nwere  notified  to  staff  on  16  December  2015  and  introduced  effective  1  January  2016  by \n\nAdministrative Order (\u201cAO\u201d) No. 3.06 (\u201cEducation Assistance\u201d). \n\nThe Applicants contend that the right to receive the EA is a fundamental and essential term \n\nof their employment contract and, as such, cannot be unilaterally altered by the Respondent.   \n\n \n\n                                                      \n1 Later reduced to 96 Applicants. \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n \n\n1 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v.

It is \n\nappropriate, however, to give a summary below.  \n\n5. \n\nThe  EA  is  one  element,  and  an  important  element,  of  the  remuneration  package  of \n\nInternational Staff. The stated purpose of the EA is to provide education assistance to International \n\nStaff towards costs of educating their dependent children. The  provision of EA is based on the \n\nunderlying premise of cost-sharing between the Bank and eligible International Staff, so that the \n\nassistance provides a percentage (not the full amount) of the costs, with a cap on the grant.2\n\n The \n\nchallenged changes both expanded and adjusted different components of those benefits. Two key \n\nrevisions introduced were the level of tuition subsidy and a new methodology to determine the flat \n\nrate allowance that helped meet non-tuition related costs of pursuing education outside the duty \n\nstation. \n\nThe grant consists of several elements, covering tuition fees, board and lodging, and travel, \n\nto each of which caps are applied. The EA package is regularly reviewed. The impugned measures, \n\nfor example, took effect on 1 January 2016 and are laid down in AO No. 3.06. They replaced an \n\nearlier  version  of  this  AO  that  entered  into  force  from  the  2007/08  academic  year.  This  latter \n\nversion replaced one that was issued on 1 January 2002.  \n\nThe  EA  changes  were  introduced  following  a  regular  quinquennial  review  of  ADB\u2019s \n\ncompensation and benefits package, which took place in the context of the ADB\u2019s 2020 Strategy \n\nand the related \u201cOur People Strategy\u201d, which emphasized the need to provide remuneration and \n\n                                                      \n2 An early policy ADB Board Paper from 1968 noted, \u201cIt is intended that Education Grants will offset, to a reasonable extent, the \nadditional educational costs which a professional staff member incurs as a result of his assuming duty away from the home country \nand not being in a position to continue educating his child in his homeland or in the same household.\u201d \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n2 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nbenefits that are competitive in the international marketplace and in each location where the Bank \n\noperates.3  \n\n \n\n8. \n\n \n\n9. \n\n \n10. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe objectives of the 2015 Comprehensive Review were explained to staff to include: (i) \n\nassessment of the competitiveness of the Bank\u2019s compensation and benefits policies with reference \n\nto global or local employment markets from which the Bank recruits its staff; (ii) assessment of \n\nsustainability  and  cost  efficiency  of  ADB\u2019s  compensation  and  benefits  policies  and  its \n\neffectiveness  in  supporting  talent  acquisition,  staff  development  and  retention;  and  (iii) \n\nidentification  of  areas  where  changes  in  the  staffing,  compensation  and  benefits  policies  are \n\nrequired to support the Bank\u2019s business needs and changing workforce demographics. \n\nThe  main  findings  of  the  2015  Comprehensive  Review  in  relation  to  international  staff \n\nwere that (i) the compensation was \u201con par or above comparators,\u201d and (ii) the benefits (including \n\nthe Bank\u2019s education assistance) were \u201cabove the median and average of the comparators\u201d. \n\nThe President also explained that the Bank was proposing the changes as: \n\n(a)  \u201cour  compensation  and  benefits  should  be  consistent  with  our  mission  of \n\neradicating poverty in the region\u201d; \n\n \n(b)  \u201cwe  need  to  pay  attention  to  greater  equity  between  different  personal \ncircumstances  of  our  individual  staff  members\u201d  [noting  an  overemphasis  on \nbenefits for international staff with children in higher education]; and \n\n \n(c)  \u201cwe compared our system carefully with other international financial institutions, \nand found some benefits go beyond what our comparators offer [and] \u2026. there is \nroom for improving some other benefits.\u201d \n\n11. \n\nA great number of proposals for changes to salaries and benefits were made. They were \n\nsubject to extensive consultations, including at town-hall meetings, and the proposals were, as a \n\nconsequence, substantially modified. The changes both expanded and adjusted various component \n\nparts of the education grants and allowances program.  The major changes are the following:   \n\n                                                      \n3 This is also in accordance with paragraph 3.2 of AO No. 3.01 (on Salary Administration), which provides that ADB\u2019s salaries are \nmaintained at levels competitive with those in comparator organizations and with due regard to the duty station concerned. \n \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n3 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v.

PROCEEDINGS \n\nOriginal Application and Decision No. 109 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12. \n\nOn 16 June 2016 the original Application was, with the Respondent\u2019s agreement, submitted \n\ndirectly to the Tribunal pursuant to Article II(3)(a) of the Asian Development Bank Administrative \n\nTribunal\u2019s Statute (\u201cADBAT Statute\u201d) and Rule 6(8) of its Rules of Procedure (\u201cthe Tribunal\u2019s \n\nRules\u201d). The Application had provided simply the names of 122 Applicants without any supporting \n\ndata, and so the Tribunal directed the Applicants to submit additional documents. The Tribunal \n\nsubsequently received the names and birthdates of children for 106 of the 122 Applicants. The \n\nRespondent  raised  the  issue  of  locus  standi  for  nine  Applicants  who  did  not  have  children  but \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n4 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\notherwise did not raise preliminary objections to the admissibility of the cases or to the jurisdiction \n\nof the Tribunal. The case was considered by the Tribunal on 6 May 2017 in its Decision No. 109. \n\n13. \n\nIn Decision No. 109, the Tribunal dealt with the matter of admissibility sua sponte and held \n\nthat the original Application was inadmissible as the Applicants had failed to substantiate how the \n\nrules had adversely affected them on an individual basis. However, the Tribunal noted the need \n\nfor a determination in law regarding the question whether the EA changes adopted by the Bank \n\nviolated fundamental and essential rights of its employees under their employment contracts and \n\ninvited the Applicants, if they chose, to submit a further application that met the requirements for \n\nadmissibility as set out in its Decision. \n\nFurther Application and Decision No. 112 \n\n14. \n\nOn  8  September  2017,  106  Applicants  (16  Applicants  having  formally  withdrawn) \n\nsubmitted their Further Application. The Applicants chose not to seek to repeat the facts and the \n\nlaw that they had already  pleaded  as part of their original  Application  and 30 September 2016 \n\nReply. The Applicants asserted that jurisdiction ratione temporis had been satisfied and that the \n\nissue of joinder of the Applicants  was  for the Tribunal  to  decide.  The  Further Application  put \n\nforward  seven  Applicants  as  \u201crepresentative  examples\u201d  but  otherwise  continued  to  rely  on  the \n\nBank\u2019s cooperation in providing relevant calculations of loss for each Applicant. \n\n15. \n\nOn  7  November  2017,  the  Respondent  submitted  its  Preliminary  Objections  to  the \n\nJurisdiction of the Tribunal in accordance with Rule 7 (6), of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules. The Respondent \n\ndid not produce further background elements in its Preliminary Objections to the Jurisdiction of \n\nthe  Tribunal  and  it  reserved  its  position  on  the  joinder  of  Applications.  It  agreed  that  four \n\nApplicants\u2019 cases were admissible in relation to Education Assistance Year (\u201cEAY\u201d) 2016/17 but \n\nobjected, at that time, to the remaining 102 Applicants in the Further Application on the basis that \n\nthey had either failed to substantiate to what extent the EA changes had adversely affected them \n\nor  had  signed  separation  arrangements  agreeing  to  waive  any  and  all  claims  arising  from  their \n\nemployment.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n5 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n16. \n\nOn the same basis, the Respondent noted its willingness to find the Further Application \n\nadmissible for those Applicants once they had completed an internal administrative verification \n\nand  substantiated  the  extent  to  which  the  EA  changes  had  adversely  affected  them  when \n\nimplemented and applied to them. In later stages this was completed with \u201cagreed facts\u201d between \n\nthe parties submitted for 37 Applicants of the 964 Applicants who remained a part of the Further \n\nApplication.   \n\n17. \n\nPursuant  to  Rule  7  (6)  of  the  Tribunal\u2019s  Rules,  upon  receiving  the  Respondent\u2019s \n\nPreliminary Objections to the Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction, proceedings on the merits were suspended \n\nwhile the Tribunal considered the issue of admissibility. In Decision No. 112, the Tribunal ruled \n\nthat 37 of the 96 Applications were admissible, joined those cases, and ordered recommencement \n\nof consideration of the issues. The Tribunal deferred the matter related to costs until resolution on \n\nthe merits. \n\nProceedings since Decision No. 112 \n\n18. \n\nIn  accordance  with  Decision  No.  112,  the  Respondent  submitted  its  Further  Answer  to \n\nApplicants\u2019 Further Application on 26 March 2018. On 9 April 2018 the Applicants submitted \n\ntheir  Further  Reply  on  behalf  of  the  37  Applicants  and  thereafter,  on  17  April  2018,  a  Costs \n\nSchedule. On 25 April 2018 the Respondent submitted its Further Rejoinder. \n\n19. \n\nIn their Further Reply, the Applicants agreed with the Respondent in its Further Answer \n\nthat the written submissions already before the Tribunal addressed the relevant facts and applicable \n\nlegal framework. As such, the Tribunal was requested to read the Further Reply as a companion \n\nto the Applicants\u2019 original Application, Reply and Further Application. The Applicants requested \n\nan award of reasonable legal costs incurred since the issuance of Decision No. 109. One Applicant \n\nrequested anonymity pursuant to Tribunal Practice Direction No. 3 and asked that his name be \n\nredacted from Decision No. 112 at para. 47. \n\n                                                      \n4 Ninety-eight Applicants submitted their  Observations on ADB\u2019s Preliminary Objections, eight Applicants having withdrawn.  \nSubsequent to that, two further Applicants withdrew. \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n20. \n\nOn  21  May  2018  the  Tribunal  requested,  pursuant  to  Rule  10  of  the  ADBAT  Rules  of \n\nProcedure, the Respondent to submit additional written statements of the annual  gross salaries, \n\nallowances and deductions for years 2015, 2016 and 2017 for each of the Applicants. This was \n\nprovided on 1 June 2018 along with a request to ensure each statement was shared only with the \n\nApplicant named therein due to its sensitivity. \n\n21. \n\nOn 30 May 2018, the Applicants\u2019 Counsel informed the Tribunal secretariat by email that \n\n(a)  one  Applicant  had  withdrawn  from  the  case  (leaving  36  Applicants  to  whom  the  Further \n\nApplication applied); and (b) the remaining Applicants requested that their names be redacted from \n\nDecision No. 112 and \u201canonymized\u201d from the present judgment. The email noted that \u201ca number \n\nof  Applicants  have  expressed  concerns  that  the  mere  presence  of  their  names  is  likely  to  be \n\nseriously prejudicial to them.\u201d It also noted that although Decision No. 112 had been \u201cout for some \n\nmonths\u201d this had \u201cno effect on the Applicants\u2019 request for anonymity, because what they seek is \n\nto avoid any issues further down the line.\u201d  \n\n22. \n\nOn 31 May 2018 the Executive Secretary of the Tribunal acknowledged the requests in the \n\nemail while at the same time asking the Applicants to \u201cformalize the request through a pleading \n\nfiled directly with the Tribunal \u2026 since reliefs sought under the Rules of Procedure must always \n\nbe contained in formal pleadings filed with the Tribunal so that they become part of the records of \n\nthe case.\u201d  The request was formalized by a pleading dated 27 June 2018. \n\nRelief Sought \n\n23. \n\nThe 36 Applicants request the Tribunal to: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrescind the EA changes made (pursuant to Article X (1) and Rule 6 (3)(b)); \n\n(i) \n \n(ii)  compensate for any losses suffered following the introduction of the EA changes, \nthereby  putting  Applicants  back  in  the  position  they  would  have  been  in  had  the \nunlawful changes not been implemented by the Bank (pursuant to Article X (1)); and \n\n \n(iii)   award reasonable legal costs incurred by Applicants in the case, taking into account \nthe  nature  and  complexity  of  the  case  and  the  nature  and  quality  of  the  work \nperformed, pursuant to Article X (2). \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n7 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n24. \n\nThe  Respondent  submits  that  the  Applicants\u2019  consent  was  not  required  to  alter  the \n\neducation  benefits  in  the  manner  revised  by  the  EA  Changes,  and  that  the  EA  Changes  were \n\nintroduced  in  a  manner  consistent  with  Respondent\u2019s  legal  authority.  Respondent  requests  the \n\nTribunal dismiss the Applicants\u2019 Further Application in its entirety. \n\nIII. FINDINGS \n\nPreliminary Matters \n\nConfidentiality and En Banc \n\n25. \n\nUnder Practice Direction No. 3 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure the Applicants have \n\nrequested that the details (i.e., the names) of the Applicants be redacted from this judgment. They \n\nalso requested that the Tribunal \u201canonymize\u201d in Decision No. 112 the 37 names that are listed at \n\nparagraph 47 of that judgment, a request that was not made before that Decision was issued. The \n\nApplicants submit that the fact that this second judgment has been out for some months would not \n\nhave an effect on the Applicants\u2019 request for anonymity, because what they were seeking was to \n\navoid  any  issues  further  down  the  line,  so  they  asked  for  the  current  version  of  the  published \n\njudgment  to  be  taken  down  and  replaced  with  a  properly  anonymized  version.  The  Applicants \n\nsubmit that it is of critical importance that ordinary staff members perceive that the options for \n\nvindicating their rights are devoid of any opportunity for intimidation or retaliation. They added, \n\nto be clear, that they were not alleging that there have been instances of intimidation or retaliation, \n\nbut they felt that there might be risks in the future. \u201cAt its lowest\u201d, they felt that the inclusion of \n\ntheir names on the judgment(s) might result in prejudice to them. Given that redaction would not \n\ndisadvantage  the  Bank  in  any  way,  they  considered  their  request  both  reasonable  and  proper. \n\nLastly, the administrative burden of redacting paragraph 47 of Decision No. 112 would be slight. \n\n26. \n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with the reasoning behind the request. It, first of all, considers \n\nthat anonymity only has an impact for the public at large, and not for the Respondent who anyway \n\nknows who the Applicants are. Second, this reasoning would mean that it would have to be applied \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n8 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nto  each  and  every  appeal.  The  Applicants  concede  that  there  have  not  been  instances  of \n\nintimidation or retaliation, but they feel that there are risks in the future. This is a serious, and \n\nunsubstantiated, insinuation of a real risk of retaliation, which the Tribunal may consider only if it \n\nis corroborated by facts  and convincing arguments, and which would anyway not disappear by \n\nsimply \u201canonymizing\u201d Applicants\u2019 names. The Applicants have failed to provide any convincing \n\nelement in support of their submission. Nor does the Tribunal itself have any indication whatsoever \n\nof a current or future risk of retaliation, which would indeed be a major violation of basic principles \n\nunderlying the judicial process. In any event, according to Article IX, paragraph 1 of the Tribunal\u2019s \n\nStatute, \u201c[all] decisions of the Tribunal \u2026 shall be final and binding,\u201d and therefore a request for \n\nanonymity  cannot  be  granted  retroactively  concerning  an  earlier  Decision  that  is  final  and \n\npublished.  The  present  proceedings  cannot  be  used  to  correct  an  omission  in  the  past.  As  a \n\nconsequence, the requests as presented cannot be granted. \n\n27. \n\nOn the other hand, the main purpose of the present proceedings is to establish the legality \n\nof the changes in the EA. Both parties have agreed to submit directly to the Tribunal a matter that \n\nis of interest to a great number of present and future staff. The purpose is not to identify individual \n\nstaff members and their private situations, and the Tribunal will maintain this approach throughout \n\nthis Decision. \n\n28. \n\nIn view of the complexity of the legal issues raised in the case,  and in accordance with \n\nArticle  V(5)  of  the  Tribunal\u2019s  Statute  read  with  Rule  5A  of  its  Rules,  the  Tribunal  deems  it \n\nappropriate to consider the case en banc. \n\n \nAdmissibility \n\n29. \n\nIn its Decision No. 109 the Tribunal recalled that it has the power to rule only upon a staff \n\nmember\u2019s  claim  that  the  Bank  has  rendered  a  decision  that  violates  that  staff  member\u2019s \n\nemployment contract and that has directly and adversely affected him or her.

ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n30. \n\nIn  its  Decision  No.  112  the  Tribunal  found  that  37  Applicants  had  submitted  financial \n\nsubstantiation  concerning  their  claims  of  alleged  actual  financial  losses  for  the  EAY  2016/17.  \n\nFollowing  the  withdrawal  by  one  Applicant,  currently  36  Applicants  are  subject  to  the  present \n\nDecision. \n\n31. \n\nFurther analysis of the data provided, however, shows that a number of the Applicants have \n\nnot been adversely affected by the new system and, in fact, received more or the same EA in EAY \n\n2016/17 than under the previous EA scheme. This is, for example, the case with Applicants who \n\nhave received tuition subsidy for pre-primary education, which did not exist before. Since they \n\nwere not adversely affected their claims are therefore inadmissible. \n\n32. \n\nEqually,  claims  from  Applicants  who  saw  an  increase  of  their  EA  in  EAY  2016/2017 \n\nbecause of the application of the 80% phasing out scheme, or because of higher FRA, and of those \n\nwho did not see a change in their EA amounts, are inadmissible. \n\n33. \n\nIn so far as their claims relate to the future, these are also inadmissible, since the Tribunal, \n\nas it held in Decision No. 109, cannot deal with potential or hypothetical cases. \n\n \nThe Merits \n\n34. \n\nAnalysis of the cases that are retained as admissible shows that the actual alleged losses \n\nare  limited  to  the  FRA  for  non-tuition  costs,  such  as  board  and  lodging.  Two  changes  were \n\nintroduced  in  this  respect:  (1)  The  allowance  would  no  longer  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  a \n\npercentage of the school country limit but was set at 75% of the respective World Bank subsistence \n\ngrant for room and board, and (2) It would no longer be paid regarding dependants who live with \n\nrelatives;  this  is  on  the  presumption  that  there  are  no,  or  substantially  lower,  non-tuition  costs \n\ninvolved. \n\n35. \n\nFour Applicants have, or had, one or more dependants living with relatives.

ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nthe  legality  of  this  particular  measure  to  abolish  assistance  for  this  category,  nor  have  the \n\nApplicants concerned provided proof of financial harm.  \n\nA)  The Bank\u2019s power to make unilateral changes to terms and conditions \n\n36. \n\nIt is a well-established legal principle that the power to make rules implies in principle the \n\nright  to  amend  them  unilaterally.  This  power  flows  from  the  responsibilities  of  the  competent \nauthorities  of  the  Bank.5  ADB  staff  accept  this  principle  when  they  sign  the  Affirmation  upon \nAppointment. It is equally well established that there are limits to this power and that any changes \n\nmust be reasonable and must respect the essential and acquired rights of staff.6 \n\n37. \n\nIt  is  in  this  respect  recalled  that  in  Mesch  and  Siy  (No.  3),  Decision  No.  18  [1996]  II \n\nADBAT  Reports,  the  Tribunal  referred  to  its  first  Decision  (Lindsey  Decision  No.  1  [1991]  I \n\nADBAT Reports 5), where it outlined the principal rules of law within the framework of which \n\nthe facts must be considered: \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n19. In Lindsey, Decision No. 1 [1992], the Tribunal identified the principal rules of law \nwithin the framework of which the facts of a case must be considered:  \n\n \nIn addition to the constituent instruments of the Bank and of the Tribunal, as well \nas general principles of law, these rules are to be derived from the contract between \nthe Bank and the staff member, the Staff Rules and Regulations of the Bank, the \nPersonnel Handbooks for professional and support staff, and Administrative Orders \nand  Circulars,  as  promulgated  and  applied  from  time  to  time,  subject  to  the \nrecognition  of  any  acquired  right  of  the  staff,  and,  by  analogy,  from  the  staff \npractices  of  international  organisations  generally,  including  the  decisions  of \ninternational administrative tribunals dealing with comparable situations. There is, \nin this sphere, a large measure of \u201ccommon\u201d law of international organisations to \nwhich, according to the circumstances, the Tribunal will give due weight. \n\n38. \n\nRegarding the power to amend the terms of employment the Tribunal observed: \n\n21.  The  power  of  an  organization  to  amend  the  contract  of  employment  or  terms  of \nappointment has been lucidly set out in de Merode, WBAT Reports 1981, Decision No. 1:  \n\n                                                      \n5 Cf. de Merode, WBAT Reports 1981, Decision No. 1, paragraph 31. \n6 Cf. Idem, paragraph 35. \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n11 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n \n\n35.  [T]he Bank has the power unilaterally to change conditions of employment of \nthe staff. At the same time, significant limitations exist upon the exercise of such \npower.  \n....  \n40.  \u2026  The  Tribunal  notes  that  [the  distinction  between  unilateral  amendments \nwhich are permissible and those which are not] cannot rest on the extent to which \na staff member accepted such power of amendment in his letter of appointment. \nEven if no reservation of the power of amendment were expressly included in the \nletters of appointment, such a power would be implied from the internal law of the \nBank. Likewise, even if those cases where a power of amendment is reserved in \nterms  which  impose  no  limitation  upon  its  exercise,  this  cannot  be  construed  to \naccord to the organization an unrestricted power of amendment. The scope of the \nwords as used in the exchange of letters must be read against the background of the \nBank's  internal  law,  and  it  is  not  on  the  strength  and  extent  of  any  individual's \nacceptance that the power of amendment and its limitations may be defined.  \n....  \n42. \u2026 Certain elements are fundamental and essential in the balance of rights and \nduties of the staff member; they are not open to any change without the consent of \nthe  staff  member  affected.  Others  are  less  fundamental  and  less  essential  in  this \nbalance; they may be unilaterally changed by the Bank in the exercise of its power, \nsubject to [certain] limits and conditions. ...  \n\u2026. \n44. \u2026 The Tribunal prefers not to invoke the phrase \u201cacquired rights\u201d in order to \ndescribe essential rights. \u2026 It is not because there is an acquired right that there is \nno  power  of  unilateral  amendment.  It  is  rather  because  certain  conditions  of \nemployment are so essential and fundamental and, by reason thereof, unchangeable \nwithout the consent of the staff member, that one can speak of acquired rights. In \nother words, what one calls \u201cthe doctrine of acquired rights\u201d does not constitute the \ncause  or  justification  of  the  unchangeable  character  of  certain  conditions  of \nemployment.  It  is  simply  a  handy  expression  of  this  unchangeable  character,  of \nwhich  the  cause  and  the  justification  are  to  be  found  in  the  fundamental  and \nessential character of the relevant conditions of employment.  \n \n\n22.  Although some terms and conditions of employment can be prospectively altered, the \nprinciple  that  fundamental  and  essential  terms  and  conditions  of  employment  cannot \nunilaterally be amended is now a recognized principle which can be regarded as part of the \nlaw  common  to  international  organizations.  That  principle  imposes  a  limitation  on  the \npowers  of  the  governing  bodies  of  every  international  organization,  restraining  the \nunilateral amendment of such terms and conditions\u2026  \n \n\nThe Tribunal concluded that it had competence to consider whether a decision of the Bank is a \n\nnullity because it purports to amend unilaterally a fundamental and essential term or condition of \n\nemployment. \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n12 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n \n39. \n \n\nAnd in Suzuki, Decision No. 82 [2008] VIII ADBAT Reports 59, the Tribunal held: \n\n26.  \u2026 The Bank clearly advised employees of the transitory nature of benefits and the \npotential  for  such  change  with  the  following  provision  in  its  handbook:  \u201cThere  is  no \ndifference  in  the  coverage  and  the  benefits  provided  by  the  GMIP  and  PRGMIP  in  the \npresent plan.\u201d (emphasis supplied). \n \n27.  That reservation of the right to amend from time to time the terms of insurance for \nBank employees is consistent with rulings of other tribunals in other international agencies.  \nThe ILOAT in Dekker  (No 3) ILOAT Judgment No. 1917 (3 February 2000) in para. 7 \ndecided  that  \u201cthe  complainant  has  no  specific  claim  to  a  specific  system  of  health \ninsurance\u201d noting that changes made did not violate any acquired right. Thus we find that \nthe  details  of  coverage,  charges  and  fees  of  the  healthcare  benefit  under  GMIP  and \nPRGMIP in effect at any particular time are elements of a benefit which themselves are \nsubject to change, and that employees were advised of that prospect when the economics \nof the program so justified. We must conclude that the ADB did not breach any obligation \nincurred  by  the  Bank  to  Mr.  Suzuki  at  the  time  of  his  hire  when  it  later  extended  that \nhealthcare program to pensioners with the potential for subsequent adjustment to retired \nemployees and their dependents. \n\n32. \nIn examining changes \u2026 it is essential to assure that (i) the objective of such change \nis rational and legitimate, (ii) there is evidence to support the different treatment of various \nmember groups, (iii) there is a rational nexus between the classification of persons subject \nto the differential treatment and the objective of the classification, and (iv) the differential \ntreatment is proportionate to the objective of the change.\u201d (see Mr R v IMF, Judgment No. \n2002-1 [5 March, 2002]) \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n38. \n In this  case  we find that  the Bank\u2019s action is  in  conformity also  with  standards \nprescribed in De Merode, WBAT Decision No. 1 [1981], para. 88 where it showed that \n\u201cthis was not a hastily adopted reform but a change studied at length and most carefully \nprepared.\u201d The Bank after its earlier efforts in developing Decisions 1 and 2, investigated \nthe issues further and undertook consultation with staff and pensioners prior to the issuance \nof Decision 3. Although the pensioners as a  group did  not  endorse the changes,  we are \nsatisfied that the Bank enhanced the contributory role of those affected by the changes and \nthat the changes set forth benefited from such consultation. \n \nIt is opportune to quote another paragraph of de Merode here: \n\n41.   Nor can the distinction between what is permissible and what is impermissible rest on \nthe state of mind or the intentions of staff members at the time of taking their employment, \non their \u201cexpectations\u201d or \u201creliance\u201d or on the motivating factors which might have induced \nthem to accept or remain in employment with the Bank. Subjective considerations are at \nbest difficult to identify and the difficulty increases with time. The possibility exists that \n\n40. \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n13 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\ndifferent considerations may prevail with different individuals, thus occasioning a diversity \nof  governing  rules  where  uniformity  is  necessary.  Moreover,  there  are  at  least  two \nsubjective intentions in any contract. There is no more reason to attach greater weight to \nthe intention of the staff member than to that of the Bank. Furthermore, staff members are \nentitled to the observance of their conditions of employment as they may exist from time \nto time, and not only of those terms of appointment which induced them to accept service \nwith the Bank and on the maintenance of which they have placed their \u201cexpectations\u201d and \ntheir \u201creliance\u201d. In entering the service of the Bank, the staff member expects, or should \nexpect,  that  these  elements  may  be  altered  in  the  future  to  take  account  of  changing \ncircumstances. \n\n41. \n\nThe Tribunal will in the present case maintain this approach and reasoning.  \n\nB)    Did  the  Bank  breach  a  fundamental  and  essential  term  of  contract  by  introducing  the  EA \n\nchanges? \n\n42. \n\nThe Applicants argue that the right to receive the EA is a fundamental and essential term \n\nof contract and, as such, cannot be unilaterally altered by the Bank. They submit that this is the \n\ncase because the EA was included as a well-defined undertaking when the Applicants accepted \n\ntheir posts with the ADB. They contend that the EA changes made on 1 January 2016 without the \n\nApplicants\u2019 consent abolished \u201ca substantial portion of the Applicants\u2019 fundamental and essential \n\nrights\u201d and is contrary to international administrative law. \n\n43. \n\nThey submit that the EA has the quality of being \u201cessential\u201d because it was included as a \n\nspecific and well-defined undertaking when the Applicants accepted their post, induced staff into \n\nemployment, and was relied on when staff made the decision to join. They allege that prospective \n\nstaff  were  clearly  told  by  BPMSD  that  the  ADB\u2019s  benefits  were  the  real  long-term  benefit  of \n\njoining ADB and, in many cases, this was followed up with written information confirming the \n\nbenefits available. \n\n44. \n\nThe  Applicants  also  contend  that  the  EA  changes,  such  as  limiting  tertiary  education \n\nbenefits  to  four  years post-secondary  compared to when the dependant  turns 24  years old,  and \n\nreducing the FRA, involve the elimination or abolition of substantial chunks of the EA. They allege \n\npotential social hardship as well as negative financial impact. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n14 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n45. \n\nThe Applicants submit that they had a legitimate expectation that the EA would continue \n\nunchanged.  They  argue  that  such  an  expectation  may  arise,  even  where  the  Staff  Rules  and \n\nRegulations  explicitly  reserve  a  right  of  change.  Accordingly,  the  doctrine  of  \u201cpromissory \n\nestoppel\u201d should apply and the ADB should be estopped from applying changes that would be \n\ninconsistent with the Applicants\u2019 legitimate expectation that the EA would continue to be operated \n\non the basis of the EA with an income equivalent to what they signed up for. \n\n46. \n\nIn Reply to the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the implementation of the benefits was not \n\nfundamental, the Applicants argue that changing the very components that make up a fundamental \n\nand essential term goes beyond a change in its implementation.  \n\n47. \n\nThe  Respondent  submits  that  (1)  the  EA  changes  did  not  alter  any  \u201cfundamental  and \n\nessential\u201d term(s) of the Applicants\u2019 employment; and (2) the Respondent had the legal authority \n\nto exercise its discretion to unilaterally revise the implementation of the education grant policy \n\nthat resulted in the EA changes, and did so in a manner consistent with limitations comprising the \n\nde Merode criteria.   \n\n48. \n\nThe Respondent contends that the provision of education grants to  International Staff is \n\nfundamental and essential in principle but not in implementation and that it has legal authority and \n\ndiscretion  to  revise  the  terms  and  conditions  of  staff  benefits  from  time  to  time  without  the \n\nApplicants\u2019  consent.  It  submits  that  the  Application  invites  the  Tribunal  to  depart  from  well-\n\nestablished  jurisprudence  regarding  the  judicial  deference  to  the  authority  of  an  international \n\norganization to amend the terms and conditions of employment. \n\n49. \n\nAs  the  Tribunal  mentioned  supra,  reasonable  education  assistance  is  an  important  and \n\nessential part of the compensation package for International Staff. Abolition of it, for example, \n\nwould  touch  on  an  essential  right  and  would,  most  likely,  require  consent  of  the  staff  member \n\nconcerned. But that is not the case here. The EA has not been abolished; it has been reviewed, as \n\nit has been several times before, which in itself constitutes a significant precedent showing that the \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n15 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nassistance package was not sacrosanct and could be modified from time to time.7 Moreover, the \n\nemployment contracts specify that staff are expected to comply with present and future regulations. \n\nRegulations in force at the moment of recruitment were attached to the contract.  \n\n50. \n\nA  new  balance  was  struck  in  2015  in  the  overall  compensation  package  for  all  staff, \n\nincluding the EA package for  International  Staff, in  order to  meet  the Bank\u2019s stated objectives \n\nwhile  keeping  the  compensation  package  attractive  for  recruitment  and  retention  of  highly \n\n \n\n \n\nqualified staff.  \n\n51. \n\nThe Bank\u2019s International Staff was, and remains, entitled to education assistance. While \n\nthe EA may be a fundamental and essential element of the Applicants\u2019 terms of appointment, the \n\nsame can, however, not be said concerning the details thereof.8 The employment contracts do not \n\nspecify any details of the EA and staff concerned thus do not have a claim to specific details of \n\nthis assistance. The normative texts in this respect are formulated in general terms. Section 14 of \n\nthe Staff Regulations provides that  \n\n\u201cStaff  members  may  be  entitled  to  dependency  allowance  and  education  grants  in \naccordance with the Administrative Orders \u2026\u201d  \n \n\nand AO 3.06 paragraph 1, states: \n \n\n\u201cIt is the policy of ADB to provide education assistance to international staff members \n\u2026 towards costs of educating their dependent children\u2026.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n \n\nThey do not guarantee specific amounts or a particular level of assistance, nor do they state that \n\nthese cannot be subject to any change. \n\n \n52. \n\nThe  details  of  the  EA  are  therefore  not  part  of  those  fundamental  elements  of  the \n\nApplicants\u2019 conditions of employment that require consent of the staff for changes thereto.9 \n\n                                                      \n7 Cf. Idem, note 5, paragraph 78. \n8 Cf. Idem, paragraph 77. \n9 Cf. In Re Andres (No. 2), ILOAT Judgment No. 726 (1986), paragraph 15: \n\n[t]hough the staff member may have an acquired right to an allowance, he will not necessarily have an acquired right to \nthe method of reckoning it or to the actual amount. \n\nSee. also In re Settino, ILOAT Judgment No. 426 (1980), consideration 7: \n\nThe right to salary and to the well-established allowances, such as those for dependants, is essentially a fundamental \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n16 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n53. \n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal concludes that there was no violation of essential rights \n\nrequiring the explicit consent of the staff concerned. \n\nC) Did the Bank amend the EA in a manner inconsistent with its legal obligations or did the Bank \n\nabuse its powers? \n\n54. \n\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the EA changes did not violate essential rights, the \n\nTribunal now needs to verify whether the EA changes violate any other rights of the Applicants, \n\nsuch as acquired rights that are not essential rights, or violate any other legal obligations of the \n\nBank.  This  Tribunal  considers  it  not  necessary  to  enter  into  a  semantic  discussion  concerning \n\nessential rights or acquired rights, or other rights, when reviewing the present case. The Tribunal \n\ndeems it useful to recall fundamental jurisprudence in this respect. Besides, parties have used these \n\nrespective notions throughout the pleadings. \n\n55. \n\nIn addition, the Tribunal must review whether the procedures leading to the changes have \n\nbeen correctly followed or whether the EA changes were made in a manner inconsistent with the \n\nBank\u2019s legal obligations. It will, in line with Suzuki, in particular need to review whether (i) the \n\nobjective of the changes is rational and legitimate, (ii) there is evidence to support the different \n\ntreatment of various member groups, (iii) there is a rational nexus between the classification of \n\npersons subject to the differential treatment and the objective of the classification, and (iv) the \n\ndifferential treatment is proportionate to the objective of the change. See Suzuki, Decision No. \n\n82 [2008] VIII ADBAT Reports 59, para. 32. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                      \n\nright. But this does not mean that every item making up the salary or allowance and every detail of the process by which \nit is calculated are to be deemed inviolate\u2026 \n\nAnd In re Elsen and Elsen-Drouot, ILOAT Judgment No. 368 (1979), consideration 7: \n\nIt is quite clear that expatriation, education and leave expense allowances are matters of importance to someone who \njoins  the  staff  of  an  international  organisation.  The  question  therefore  arises  whether  the  outright  abolition  of  such \nallowances  would  in  principle  violate  an  acquired  right.  There  is,  however,  no  acquired  right  to  the  amount  and  the \nconditions  of  payment  of  such  allowances.  Indeed  the  staff  member  should  expect  amendments  to  be  prompted  by \nchanges in circumstances if, for example, the cost of living rises or falls, or the organisation reforms its structure, or even \nfinds itself in financial difficulty. Hence the reduction in the expatriation allowance paid to the complainants does not \ninfringe any right which was of decisive importance to them in accepting appointment and which may be regarded as \nacquired. Moreover, there is no clause in their contract which even tacitly guaranteed them any such right. The plea that \nacquired rights were infringed therefore fails.  \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n17 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n56. \n\nThe Applicants argue that even if the Tribunal finds that the EA does not amount to an \n\nessential and fundamental right, the ADB did not amend it in a manner consistent with its legal \n\nobligations,  which  are  that  the  changes  must  (1)  not  be  retroactive;  (2)  be  based  on  a  proper \n\nconsideration of the relevant facts; (3) be reasonably related to the underlying objective for the \n\nchange; (4) be proposed in good faith and not prompted by improper motive; (5) not discriminate \n\nin an unjustifiable manner; and (6) be proposed in a reasonable manner to avoid excessive and \n\nunnecessary harm. The Tribunal will also take these elements, which are in fact similar to those \n\nmentioned in the previous paragraph, into account when reviewing the impugned decision. \n\n57. \n\nLastly, the Applicants submit that the ADB did not carry out meaningful consultations \n\nwith its employees and that instead the process was artificial and feigned.  \n\n58. \n\nThe  Respondent  notes  that  this  Tribunal  has  clearly  recognized  an  international \n\norganization\u2019s authority to alter unilaterally the \u201cnon-fundamental and non-essential\u201d terms of \n\nemployment, even in cases where such revision leads to a reduction in entitlements. It contends \n\nthat after the EA changes were introduced, the Bank has continued to provide a reasonable level \n\nof  education  grants  to  its  eligible  International  Staff,  consistent  with  their  fundamental  and \n\nessential terms of employment. It concludes that the changes are not retroactive, are based on the \n\nproper  consideration  of  the  relevant  facts,  are  reasonably  related  to  the  objective  they  were \n\nintended to achieve, were determined in good faith and not prompted by improper motives, do \n\nnot  discriminate,  and  were  proposed  in  a  reasonable  manner  seeking  to  avoid  excessive  and \n\nunnecessary harm to the staff.  \n\n(i) \u201cAcquired\u201d Rights \n\n59. \n\nInternational administrative tribunals regularly refer to the principle of \u201cacquired rights\u201d. \n\nIt is also a notion that has evolved over time. \n\n60. \n\nThe  International  Labour  Organization  Administrative  Tribunal  (ILOAT),  for  example, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n18 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\ngave precisions on its approach in its Judgment No. 83210: \n\n13.  In Judgment 61 (in re Lindsey) the Tribunal held that the amendment of a rule to an \nofficial's detriment and without his consent amounts to breach of an acquired right when \nthe  structure  of  the  contract  of  appointment  is  disturbed  or  there  is  impairment  of  any \nfundamental  term  of  appointment  in  consideration  of  which  the  official  accepted \nappointment. \n  \n\u2026 \n\nSo before ruling on the plea the Tribunal must in each case determine whether the altered \nterm is fundamental and essential.  \n \n14.  There are three tests it will apply.  \n \nThe  first  is  the  nature  of  the  altered  term.  It  may  be  in  the  contract  or  in  the  Staff \nRegulations or Staff Rules or in a decision, and whereas the contract or a decision may give \nrise to acquired rights the regulations and rules do not necessarily do so.  \n \nThe second test is the reason for the change. It is material that the terms of appointment \nmay often have to be adapted to circumstances, and there will ordinarily be no acquired \nright when a rule or a clause depends on variables such as the cost-of-living index or the \nvalue  of  the  currency.  Nor  can  the  finances  of  the  body  that  applies  the  terms  of \nappointment be discounted.  \n \nThe third test is the consequence of allowing or disallowing an acquired right. What effect \nwill the change have on staff pay and benefits? And how do those who plead an acquired \nright fare as against others?  \n \n\nThe ILOAT reconfirmed its approach recently in Judgment No. 390911 as follows: \n \n12.    As  the  Tribunal  pointed  out  in  Judgment  3876,  consideration  7,  international \norganisations\u2019 staff members are not entitled to have all the conditions of employment or \nretirement laid down in the provisions of the staff rules and regulations in force at the time \nof their recruitment applied to them throughout their career and retirement. Most of those \nconditions  can  be  altered  during  or  after  an  employment  relationship  as  a  result  of \namendments to those provisions, irrespective of whether the staff member\u2019s appointment \nis permanent or temporary, as in the complainant\u2019s case.  \n\nThe Tribunal has consistently held that the position is of course different if, having regard \nto the nature and importance of the provision in question, the complainant has an acquired \nright to its continued application. However, the amendment of a provision governing an \nofficial\u2019s situation to her or his detriment constitutes a breach of an acquired right only \nwhen such an amendment adversely affects the balance of contractual obligations, or alters \n\n61. \n\n                                                      \n10 In re Ayoub, Lucal, Monat, Perret-Nguyen and Samson, ILOAT Judgment No. 832 (1987). \n11 d.O.M v. OTIF, ILOAT Judgment No. 3909 (2018). \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n19 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nfundamental  terms  of  employment  in  consideration  of  which  the  official  accepted  an \nappointment, or which subsequently induced her or him to stay on. In order for there to be \na breach of an acquired right, the amendment to the applicable text must therefore relate to \na fundamental and essential term of employment within the meaning of Judgment 832 (see, \nfor example, Judgments 2089, 2682, 2986 or 3135). \n \n\n62. \n\nThe  distinction  between  essential  and  non-essential  rights,  fundamental  and  non-\n\nfundamental rights, or between acquired rights and other rights, or what upsets the balance of the \n\ncontract  and  what  does  not,  does  not  depend  on  staff  members\u2019  subjective  expectations  or  on \n\nfactors that might have induced them to accept or remain in employment with the Bank. This is \n\neven more pertinent for staff who have fixed-term contracts or who started employment with the \n\nBank when they did not, or did not yet, have children. \n\n(ii) The Tribunal\u2019s scope of review with regard to managerial decisions in general \n\n63. \n\nIt is appropriate in this context to, first of all, recall that \u201cthe Tribunal cannot say that the \n\nsubstance of a policy decision is sound or unsound.  It can only say that the decision has or has not \n\nbeen  reached  by  the  proper  processes,  or  that  the  decision  either  is  or  is  not  arbitrary, \n\ndiscriminatory, or improperly motivated, or that it is one that could or could not reasonably have \n\nbeen taken on the basis of facts accurately gathered and properly weighed\u201d. See Decision No. 1, \n\nLindsey, [1991], I ADBAT Reports 5, paragraph 12. But the Tribunal must first review whether \n\nthe changes were made according to the principles raised in paras. 55-57 as discussed below. \n\n(iii) Is the objective of the changes rational and legitimate and are the EA changes  reasonably \n\nrelated to the underlying objective for the change?  \n\n64. \n\nAs  was  mentioned  supra,  the  EA  changes  were  introduced  following  a  regular \n\nquinquennial  review  of  ADB\u2019s  compensation  and  benefits  package,  which  took  place  in  the \n\ncontext of the ADB\u2019s 2020 Strategy and the related \u201cOur People Strategy\u201d, and which emphasized \n\nthe need to provide a package of remuneration and benefits that are competitive in the international \n\nmarketplace and in each location where the Bank operates.  \n\n65. \n\nThe  objectives  of  the  2015  Comprehensive  Review  were  explained  to  staff  to  include, \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\namongst others: (i) assessment of the competitiveness of the Bank\u2019s compensation and benefits \n\npolicies with reference to global or local employment markets from which the Bank recruits its \n\nstaff; (ii)  assessment of  sustainability and  cost  efficiency of ADB\u2019s compensation and benefits \n\npolicies and its effectiveness in supporting talent acquisition, staff development and retention; and \n\n(iii) identification of areas where changes in the staffing, compensation and benefits policies are \n\nrequired to support the Bank\u2019s business needs and changing workforce demographics. \n\n66. \n\nThe Bank was also seeking to ensure that the compensation and benefits were consistent \n\nwith the Bank\u2019s mission of eradicating poverty and supporting poor people in the region; to pay \n\nattention to greater equity amongst staff so as not to overemphasize benefits of IS with children in \n\nhigher  education;  and  to  bring  the  benefits  more  in  line  with  its  comparators  such  as  other \n\nInternational Financial Institutions. \n\n67. \n\nThe Applicants contend that the underlying objective for the EA changes, i.e. to reduce the \n\nprevious EA benefits to a level more appropriate for a development bank, and to \u201cshare out\u201d the \n\nbenefits more equitably among staff including those without children, is not valid. They submit \n\nthat neither of these reasons comprises a valid objective for making the EA changes without staff\u2019s \n\nconsent.  \n\n68. \n\nThe Tribunal considers the stated objectives appropriate and valid. They are rational and \n\nlegitimate. It is recalled that the overall compensation package was reviewed, resulting in some \n\nnegative and positive changes in the EA for some staff, but a salary increase for all staff. \n\n69. \n\nThe Tribunal does not see any evidence that by adopting the package as it did, the Bank \n\nabused any of the discretionary powers or violated any of its responsibilities and obligations vis-\n\n\u00e0-vis the staff.  \n\n(iv)  Are the changes based on proper consideration of the relevant facts? \n\n70. \n\nThe  Applicants  submit  that  the  EA  changes  do  not  appear  to  have  been  subject  to  any \n\nproper consideration by Management. They note, amongst others, that BPMSD refused to disclose \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nany reports justifying the EA Changes based on factual evidence. They also claim that no evidence \n\nwas provided to staff to demonstrate the following: (a) that the level of EA had ceased to reflect \n\nthe costs of educating children at secondary or tertiary level; (b) that the SCL was not appropriate; \n\n(c) that the revised limits for tuition or flat rate allowance were appropriate; (d) that the ADB has \n\na firm understanding of what goes into the factors which constitute the SCL or the World Bank \n\nGroup Subsistence Grant for Room and Board; and (e) why the EA should now be 75% of the \n\nWorld Bank Group Subsistence Grant for Room and Board when the World Bank applies 100%. \n\n71. \n\nThe  Respondent  contends  that  the  EA  changes  were  the  result  of  a  thorough  review \n\nundertaken  in  the  context  of  the  2015  Comprehensive  Review  and  included  the  findings  of  an \n\ninternationally  recognized  consulting  firm  specializing  in  expatriate  salaries  and  benefits  that \n\ninformed the Respondent\u2019s discussions with its staff over an eight-month period. \n\n72. \n\nThe review role of the Tribunal in this respect is limited. It is not its role to entertain each \n\nelement underpinning, or not, the proposed and retained changes. That is the role of management: \n\nto be informed, make assessments, retain options, make proposals and consult with staff and their \n\nrepresentatives about  them. The Tribunal is  persuaded that the  record amply shows that this is \n\nwhat has happened. The Respondent gathered detailed relevant facts through a consulting firm, \n\nanalyzed them and relied on them. The Applicants may question the facts or the analysis thereof, \n\nbut they have not established that the Respondent acted improperly in this respect or abused its \n\npowers. It was by a reasoned judgment and after a balance of considerations that the Bank preferred \n\none formula to another, being conscious that none could be perfect in all respects.12 \n\n(v) Were the changes proposed in good faith and not prompted by improper motive? \n\n73. \n\nThe Applicants contend bad faith on the part of the Respondent since at no stage was it \n\nintimated when joining the Bank that they should be aware that Management was at liberty at any \n\ntime to take away parts of the EA. They relied on the continuation of these benefits and find that \n\nthe reasons given for the EA changes lack honesty and transparency.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                      \n12 Cf. de Merode, paragraph 76. \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n22 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n74. \n\nThe Respondent reiterates that the changes were the product of the 2015 Comprehensive \n\nReview and were introduced in the context of overall revisions to the Bank\u2019s compensation and \n\nbenefits. They were not introduced without context, or without due consideration, and they were \n\ndirectly  related  to  their  underlying  objective.  The  Respondent  argues  that  the  Applicants  have \n\nfailed to establish that the EA changes emanated from improper motives. \n\n75. \n\nThe  Tribunal  has  already  concluded  supra  that  the  Bank  has  the  power,  under  certain \n\nconditions, to unilaterally amend employment conditions and that the terms of appointment did \n\nnot guarantee benefits indefinitely or without change. The amounts have varied during the staff\u2019s \n\nemployment so far. They have signed a declaration that they accept that employment conditions \n\nmay be changed. Normative texts provide the same. Moreover, practice over the years shows that \n\nthe  compensation  package  and  the  EA  package  have  been  reviewed  and  revised  regularly.  In \n\nentering the service of the Bank, the staff member expects, or should expect, that these elements \n\nmay be altered in the future to take account of changing circumstances.13 \n\n(vi)  Do the EA changes have retroactive effect? \n\n76. \n\nThe  Applicants  submit  that  changing  education  benefits  constitutes  a  retroactive \n\namendment to the staff members\u2019 terms of conditions of employment laid down in contracts that \n\ndo already exist.  \n\n77. \n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that the EA changes did not have retroactive effect as these \n\nrights did not accrue based on past service (unlike benefits under the Staff Retirement Plan (SRP)). \n\nStaff members must meet the conditions for entitlement at the relevant time upon application for \n\nthe grant in the applicable EAY. \n\n78. \n\nThe Tribunal has already concluded that the Bank has the power, under certain conditions, \n\nto amend unilaterally employment conditions and that the terms of appointment did not guarantee \n\ndetails  of benefits  indefinitely.  It  further observes that the changes  were introduced with  effect \n\nfrom 1 January 2016, i.e. in the middle of an education year. It is perhaps not advisable to introduce \n\n                                                      \n13 Cf. de Merode, paragraph 41. \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n23 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nchanges in the middle of an education year, as the new measures also applied to the first semester \n\nof  the  academic  year,  i.e.  a  number  of  months  preceding  1  January  2016.  On  the  other  hand, \n\nentitlement to the EA and the final calculation thereof can be established only at the end of the \n\nacademic year when staff can provide all the data and documents in support of their claims. The \n\nTribunal observes that the EA changes were part of a change in the overall remuneration package, \n\nincluding a salary increase. The Tribunal notes that, while the EA changes were introduced during \n\nthe  academic  year,  the  Applicants  have  not  shown  that  the  limited  retroactivity  caused  any \n\nfinancial hardship. \n\nunjustifiable manner?  \n\n(vii)  Is there different treatment of various groups of staff or do the changes discriminate in an \n\n79. \n\nThe Applicants allege that the EA changes are discriminatory since they are retroactive in \n\nnature  and  their  impact  depends  on  factors  such  as  how  old  employees\u2019  children  are  and  what \n\ncourses they study. They also submit that some staff had made prospective plans and committed \n\nthemselves. \n\n80. \n\nThe Respondent argues that the principle of non-discrimination requires an organization to \n\ntreat similarly situated staff members fairly. It does not require the Respondent to treat all staff \n\nmembers  identically.  It  also  argues  that  no  impermissible  discrimination  exists  between  staff \n\nmembers with regard to EA Changes, since all International Staff are subject to the same rules. \n\n81. \n\nThe  Tribunal  holds  that  the  EA  provisions,  both  old  and  new,  apply  equally  to  all \n\nInternational Staff and that similarly situated staff are treated in the same way. The reimbursement \n\namounts themselves obviously differ per child, depending on a variety of factors, such as age, level \n\nof studies, place of studies, costs of studies, scholarships, only to name a few. This does, however, \n\nnot amount to improper discrimination, as the Applicants submit.    \n\n(viii) Are the changes proportionate to the objective of the change? Are the changes reasonable \n\nand do they avoid excessive and unnecessary harm? \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n24 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n82. \n\nThe Applicants contend that even with the four-year transition period, the majority of the \n\nApplicants cannot save enough to compensate for the changes, particularly those Applicants on \n\nlower salary scales or with more than two children. They submit that the changes result in, for \n\nexample, a staff member at level 4 suffering the same reduction in income as a staff member at \n\ndirector level or above. They conclude that this causes excessive harm to staff, particularly those \n\nat lower levels. \n\n83. \n\nThe  Respondent  considers  that  providing  financial  support  to  International  Staff  for  a \n\nperiod of four years of tertiary education for their eligible dependents is reasonable and consistent \n\nwith its policy, as it is sufficient to achieve a reasonable level of tertiary education. It underscored \n\nthat it did not guarantee eligible dependants any number of years of tertiary education but instead \n\neligibility up to the age of 24. It notes that when education grants were first introduced eligible \n\ndependants were under the age of 22 years. This was increased only to allow for \u201cprogression loss\u201d \n\nof children when transferring to schools in Manila. It also notes that the method for calculating the \n\nFRA was changed, as the old method was deemed no longer appropriate for achieving its purpose \n\nof  providing  a  reasonable  allowance  to  assist  International  Staff  in  meeting  non-tuition  related \n\nexpenses. The FRA had been increasing at a rate faster than the rate of the actual cost of living. \n\n84. \n\nThe Respondent further argues that the changes included (1) an increase in the maximum \n\ntuition subsidy cap; (2) continued flexibility to eligible dependants in pursuing tertiary studies; (3) \n\nno  effect  on  primary/secondary  school  options  for  staff  stationed  in  resident  missions  where \n\noptions  can  be  challenging;  (4)  phasing  in  over  a  four-year  period  to  ameliorate  the  financial \n\nimpact and provide a reasonable time to consider all tertiary education options; (5) a limited impact \n\non  dependant\u2019s pursuing tertiary studies beyond four years, as on average, over the last five years \n\nonly about 20 eligible dependants in any EAY (or 7.5% of eligible dependants) pursued tertiary \n\neducation beyond four years; and (6) immediate elimination of the FRA for those dependants who \n\nreside with family members, which was not excessively harmful as they were not incurring the \n\nnon-tuition related costs that were intended to be covered by the FRA. \n\n85. \n\nThe Tribunal, first of all, observes that at this stage the new limit of financial support for a \n\nperiod of four years of tertiary education has not been applied to any of the Applicants and this \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n25 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nmatter  is  therefore  hypothetical.  Moreover,  this  measure  is  subject  to  a  staggered  phasing-in \n\nperiod. \n\n(ix)  Should the EA changes have been \u201cgrandfathered\u201d? \n\n86. \n\nThe Applicants submit that the lawful and appropriate way for the President to achieve his \n\nobjectives  of  recasting  the  benefits  so  that  they  are  reduced  and/or  more  equitably  distributed \n\namong the entire staff is to \u201cgrandfather\u201d the benefits.  \n\n87. \n\nThe Respondent contends that it is not legally obligated to  \u201cgrandfather\u201d or \u201clock in\u201d a \n\nnon-fundamental  or  non-essential  benefit  at  the  level  prevailing  when  a  relevant  staff  member \n\ncommences employment. \n\n88. \n\nThe Respondent submits that, as noted in de Merode, an organization retains the authority \n\nto decide whether new/revised rules will apply immediately to staff members of an organization \n\nalready  employed,  and  staff  members  should  expect  such  revisions  from  time  to  time.  In  the \n\ncontext of the EA Changes, management judged that grandfathering the pre-2016 education grants \n\nfor existing staff would have led to further inequity between staff on board prior to the EA Changes \n\nand  those  who  joined  after  their  introduction.  It  also  decided  that  in  light  of  the  underlying \n\nobjectives, it was fair and equitable for all International Staff to be governed by the same rules and \n\nthat  the  four-year  transition  period  was  a  reasonable  period  for  International  Staff  to  make  the \n\nadjustment. \n\n89. \n\nThe  Tribunal  agrees  that  there  is  no  automatic  entitlement  to  \u201cgrandfathering\u201d  in  the \n\npresent case. It is also persuaded that the Bank pursued a reasonable objective and did not abuse \n\nits powers when it decided not to \u201cgrandfather\u201d.   \n\n(x) Did the EA changes upset the economic balance of the contract? \n\n90. \n\nAnalysis of the data provided shows that between 2015 and 2017, the Applicants received \n\nincreases in their basic salaries of, on average, five per cent per year. The total income of salary \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n26 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nand allowances of 27 of the 36 Applicants did not decrease in the 2015 \u2013 2017 period. It should be \n\nadded that fluctuations, upwards or downwards, in allowances were not only due to changes in the \n\nEA. Some Applicants saw their total income evolve following changes in the housing assistance \n\nor in the Outside Duty Station Allowance. Other Applicants saw their EA going down, for reasons \n\nsuch  as  children  graduating,  interrupting  studies  to  do  their  military  service,  or  receiving \n\nscholarships. The Applicant with the largest \u201closs\u201d (4,4%) fell into this category, by having had \n\nhis child leave for military service \n\n91. \n\nThe data provided also shows that the adverse impact, if any, is on average one per cent of \n\na staff member\u2019s basic salary per child. Obviously, someone with more children is affected more, \n\nbut the impact is still not large.  The actual \u201closses\u201d for staff in the 2016/17 academic year thus \n\nrepresent  a small  percentage of the total  EA,  as  well as of the total  remuneration of  each staff \n\nmember. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the changes are proportionate and reasonable and do \n\nnot  cause  excessive  harm.  The  Applicants  have  not  established  such  harm  and  have  also  not \n\nestablished that the newly  calculated FRA rates do not  provide major assistance regarding real \n\nnon-tuition costs. The FRA is a flat rate and not a direct, and partial, reimbursement of incurred \n\ncosts. In order to establish whether the new FRA rates are reasonable assistance or not, one would \n\nneed to verify what the actual and unavoidable costs really are in this respect and, as a corollary, \n\nwhat any outstanding costs remain for the staff member after the deduction of the grant.  \n\n92. \n\nLastly,  the  notion  of  \u201cupsetting  the  balance  of  the  contract\u201d  involves  a  much  more \n\nsignificant realignment of the employment relationship than has occurred here. The decrease in \n\nEA cannot  reasonably be considered as upsetting the economic balance of the relationship that \n\nApplicants had and still have with the Bank.  \n\n93. \n\nThe Tribunal notes that the decisions impugned may have an impact in the future. But that \n\nis of itself not enough to establish breach of an acquired right.14  \n\n94. \n\nIt  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  negative  impact  of  the  disputed  measures  was \n\nsubstantially cushioned by the introduction of a staggered phasing-in period of four years. This \n\n                                                      \n14 Cf.

ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nallows staff members to anticipate and take adequate measures, whenever necessary and possible, \n\nfor future academic years.  \n\n95. \n\nThe Tribunal repeats that it is the stated purpose of the EA to provide education assistance \n\nto  International  Staff  towards  meeting  costs  of  educating  their  dependent  children.  Assistance \n\ntowards costs does not amount to income, as the Applicants implied. \n\n(xi)  Was there lack of proper consultations with staff and their representatives? \n\n96. \n\nLastly,  the  Applicants  submit  as  a  compounding  factor  that  there  was  no  proper \n\nconsultation with the staff or their representatives. They refer to human rights texts and underscore \n\nthe need to hold bona fide consultations with staff before adopting a decision, to have sufficient \n\ntime for consultation,  and to  provide  adequate documentation to  enable  staff to  understand the \n\nnature  of  and  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  changes.  They  conclude  that  the  consultation  was \n\n\u201cartificial and feigned.\u201d  \n\n97. \n\nThey argue in particular that the Bank did not allow sufficient time for consultations, that \n\nthe Bank did not provide staff with adequate documentation or financial analysis to enable them \n\nto understand the changes, that the decision to change had already been taken and was presented \n\nas  a  \u201cfait  accompli\u201d,  and  that  the  changes  made  to  the  original  proposal  after  receiving  staff \n\nfeedback is not evidence of a valid consultation process given that it merely changed flagrantly \n\nunlawful proposals to less flagrant but still unlawful proposals. \n\n98. \n\nThe Respondent submits that it undertook extensive and lengthy consultations with staff \n\nand other stakeholders at every stage of the process that led to the approval of the EA changes.  It \n\nnotes that feedback from the consultations led to significant revisions and in some cases, deferral \n\nof the proposed changes (such as to the SRP and Group Medical Insurance Plan). In this regard it \n\nnotes  that  the  changes  were  not  hastily  adopted  but  resulted  in  careful  consideration  following \n\nadequate and meaningful consultations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n28 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n99. \n\nThe Tribunal observes that the issue at stake is limited to the question whether the Bank \n\nproperly followed the consultation procedure under its rules and did not violate any of its legal \n\nobligations. Applicants do not refer to any specific staff rule or regulation or provision that has \n\nallegedly been violated.  \n\n100.  Genuine consultation in good faith is indeed good management practice. The record amply \n\nshows that the Bank more than adequately respected its obligations, in particular under AO No. \n\n2.02 (\u201cPersonnel Policy Statement and Duties, Rights and Responsibilities of Staff Members\u201d), to \n\nconsult with the staff through their representatives. Numerous meetings were held, including town \n\nhall meetings and proposals were communicated. Staff Council was allowed to have its counsel \n\naddress all staff, etc. Following all this, substantial changes were made to the initial proposals. The \n\nright to consultation, however, does not entail an obligation on the part of the Bank to accept all \n\nthe proposals made by the staff and their representatives. The Applicants have failed to establish \n\nthat the extensive consultations were not held by the Bank in good faith. Accordingly, the plea \n\n101.  To sum up, the Tribunal finds that the Bank did not violate any essential or acquired rights \n\nof the Applicants or act in breach of its obligations towards its staff.  \n\nfails. \n\nIV.  RELIEF \n\n102. \n\nIn  the  Further  Reply,  the  Applicants  again  request  an  award  of  reasonable  costs  in \n\naccordance with Article X (2) of the Tribunal\u2019s Statute and taking into account the \u201cnature and \n\ncomplexity of the case and the nature and quality of the work performed.\u201d The Applicants, having \n\nbeen denied their request for an award of costs in Decision No. 109, ask that the Bank refund those \n\ncosts  incurred  since  Decision  No.  109.  On  17  April  2018  the  Applicants  submitted  a  Costs \n\nSchedule in the amount of \u00a312,525 as proof of the legal costs incurred since receipt of Decision \n\nNo. 109 (i.e. from May 2017 onwards). \n\n103.  The  Applicants  assert  that  even  if  the  Tribunal  rejects  the  Further  Application,  the \n\nRespondent  ought  to  pay  for  the  Applicants\u2019  legal  costs  incurred  in  successfully  reaching  the \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\nmerits phase of the proceedings, as the Respondent was unsuccessful in preventing the merits of \n\nthe  case  from  reaching  the  Tribunal.  The  Applicants  note  that  the  Respondent  did  not  file \n\npreliminary objections after the Application was lodged but only after the filing of the  Further \n\nApplication. The Applicants note that in Decision No. 112, the Tribunal viewed the Respondent\u2019s \n\nfiling of preliminary objections to its jurisdiction at that stage as \u201ca complication in expediting \n\nproceedings.\u201d The Respondent has had the opportunity to comment on this statement in its Further \n\nRejoinder. \n\n104.  The  Respondent  opposes  the  Applicants\u2019  request  for  costs  and  asserts  they  should  be \n\ndenied. The Respondent notes that the Article X (2) of the ADBAT Statute states that Applicants \n\nare  only  entitled  to  reasonable  costs  incurred  if  \u201can  application  is  well-founded  in  whole  or  in \n\npart.\u201d  It  asserts  that  the  rules  do  not  provide  for  the  award  of  legal  costs  in  the  event  of  an \n\nunsuccessful application.  \n\n105.  The Respondent argues that in any event, the request is not well-founded.  It notes that it \n\nhad no option but to file a Preliminary Objection when the Applicants failed to provide the relevant \n\ndocumentation in support of their claim in the Applicant\u2019s Further Application. It adds that, even \n\nthen,  the  Tribunal  upheld  Respondent\u2019s  Preliminary  Objection  with  respect  to  59  of  the  102 \n\nApplicants. \n\n106. \n\nIt  is  settled  jurisprudence  that  this  Tribunal  may  award  reasonable  legal  fees  and  costs \n\npursuant to Article X (2) of the ADBAT Statute, which provides: \n\nIf the Tribunal concludes that an application is well-founded in whole or in part, it may \norder that the reasonable costs incurred by the applicant in the case, including the cost of \napplicant\u2019s counsel, be totally or partially borne by the Bank, taking into account the nature \nand complexity of the case, the nature and quality of the work performed, and the amount \nof the fees in relation to prevailing rates. \n\nIn addition, proof of costs must be provided: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom its inception (Lindsey, Decision No. 1 [1992], I ADBAT Reports), the Tribunal has \nstressed that an applicant\u2019s Reply must contain proof of his costs. (Galang, Decision No. \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n30 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v. ADB (No. 3) \n \n\n55 [2002], VI ADBAT Reports, para. 50). \n\nThe Tribunal notes that only part of costs has been provided. \n\n107.  The Tribunal has also noted that although an applicant may succeed only in part, where \n\nissues raised are of importance the Tribunal has considered it equitable to award costs: \n\n \n\n\u201cAlthough the Applicants have not succeeded on the merits, their pleadings nonetheless \nwere  very  useful  to  the  tribunal  on  issues  that  were  important  and  complex,  and  the \nApplicants did prevail with regard to the preliminary objections. Accordingly, the Tribunal \ndecides  to  award  a  sum  towards  their  costs.\u201d  (Mesch  and  Siy  (No.  4),  Decision  No.  35 \n[1997], III ADBAT Reports, para. 51.  See also De Armas et al., Decision No. 39 [1998], \nIV ADBAT Reports, para. 93.) \n\n108.  The  Tribunal  deems  it  totally  proper  and  important  that  staff  have  the  possibility  to \n\nchallenge  the  legality  of  changes  to  underlying  general  rules  that  apply  or  may  apply  to  many \n\npresent and future staff. The Applicants and the Respondent agreed to submit the case directly to \n\nthe  Tribunal  in  order  to  obtain  a  ruling  on  the  legality  of  the  measures  in  the  interest  of  legal \n\ncertainty. Accordingly, the Respondent initially did not raise preliminary objections. \n\n109.  Having considered the representation of the parties, the criteria set out in Article X (2), and \n\nthe Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence, the Tribunal considers that the Applicants have raised a significant \n\nissue in law that had the potential to affect a much wider group of staff regarding their fundamental \n\nand essential rights. \n\n110. \n\nIt must at the same time be underlined, as the history of the present case shows, that some \n\nof the costs were avoidable. Time and resources were lost following inadequate preparation and \n\npresentation of the applications. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Applicants\u2019 pleadings were \n\nassisted in great part by the Respondent\u2019s voluntary provision of relevant documentation in support \n\nof their claims. The Tribunal considers that under these circumstances an amount of US$ 10,000 \n\nis a fair contribution towards costs. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Administrative Tribunal \n\n31 \n\n\fDecision No. 113                                                                                  Perrin, et al. v.
