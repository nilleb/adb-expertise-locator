INTRODUCTION \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\ntechnologies  are \n\nreaching  maturity \n\nthis  moment,  hydrogen-related \n\nfor \nAt \ncommercialization, and the costs are continuously falling due to signs of progress in both \ntechnologies and supply chains. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has pointed out \nthat,  from  2001  to  2011,  the  cost  of  a  fuel  cell  electrolyzer  fell  by  80%  (DOE  2015). \nMainstream  policy-making  institutes  and  international  organizations,  such  as  the  US \nDOE1 and the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2019), anticipate that hydrogen energy \nwill  reach  cost  parity  with  conventional  energy  sources  in  the  long  term.  Therefore, \nseveral  countries  and  regions  have  announced  a  roadmap  for  their  hydrogen  energy \nindustries as well as their hydrogen energy infrastructure, preparing for the large-scale \ncommercial  application  of  hydrogen  (FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership  2009;  Fuel \nCells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking 2019; Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Strategy Council \n2019). \n\nThe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  also  started  to  pay  attention  to  hydrogen \nenergy at policy-making levels in recent years. At the central government level, the State \nCouncil announced the \u201c13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of National Strategic \nEmerging Industries.\u201d2 The National Development and Reform Committee followed this \nwith its  announcement  of  \u201cAdvice  on  Deep Integration  and  Development of Advanced \nManufacturing  and  Modern  Service  Industries\u201d  in  2019.3 Both  documents  highlighted \nsupportive policies and plans for developing hydrogen energy.  \n\nAt  the  local  government  level,  several  provinces,  as  well  as  municipalities,  such  as \nZhangjiakou,  Foshan,  Rugao,  Wuhan,  Datong,  Suzhou,  and  Chengdu,  have  started \ndeveloping  hydrogen  energy  industrial  parks  and  demonstration  projects  of  hydrogen \nenergy  applications.  They  have  already  deployed  and  put  into  operation  more  than  \na  thousand  units  of  fuel  cell  buses  and  logistics  vehicles  in  these  cities  as  a \ndemonstration  and  test  bedding  of  the  technologies  (China  Hydrogen  Alliance  2018, \n2019). \n\nHydrogen  also  looks  promising  as  a  necessary component  of  the PRC\u2019s future clean \nenergy  landscape.  Firstly,  the  large-scale  application  of  renewable  energy  in the  PRC \nand its concomitant intermittency require a significant energy storage capacity to allow \nthe  energy  system,  such  as  the  power  grid,  to  absorb  the  renewable  energy  fully. \nOtherwise,  as  is  common  these  days  in  countries  that  have  already  invested  heavily  \nin  intermittent  renewables,  abandonment  of  the  harvested  renewable  energy  will \nhappen\u2014a  sheer  waste  of  energy  and  the  money  invested  in  the  renewable  energy \ncapacity.  This  provides  the country  with the  main  motivation  to consider hydrogen  as \nmassive-scale energy storage. \n\nOn  the  energy  storage  front,  pump  hydro,  wherever  it  is  still  available,  is  one  of  the  \nlow-cost energy storage solutions. However, most of the development of such potential \nis already complete. The other solution is large-scale battery storage. However, batteries \nhave  many  limits,  including  high  capital  expenditure  (CAPEX)  and  operational \nexpenditure (OPEX), a short lifetime (5\u20137 years before scrapping), and fixed and limited \n\n \n\n1   Source: \n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/downloads/fuel-cell-technologies-office-multi-year-\nresearch-development-and-22,  https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/doe-technical-targets-hydrogen-\nproduction-electrolysis, \nhttps://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/doe-technical-targets-hydrogen-\ndelivery (accessed on 2 December 2019). \n\nand \n\n2   Source: http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/201612/19/content_5150090.htm (accessed on 2 December \n\n2019). \n\n3   Source: http://zfxxgk.ndrc.gov.cn/web/iteminfo.jsp?id=16603 (accessed on 2 December 2019). \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nstorage capacity, which continually degrades over their short lifetime. Therefore, as an \nenergy storage option in the power sector, hydrogen is promising, especially considering \nthe scale of abandoned renewable energy in the PRC due to the lack of massive-scale \nenergy storage. \n\nIn the meantime, as an energy application in the transport sector, hydrogen has many \nintrinsic advantages as an energy carrier. First, its energy intensity is higher than that of \ngasoline: 5 kg of hydrogen carried onboard a sedan vehicle can sustain driving for up to \n500 km. Second, refueling can take place as quickly as that of gasoline and diesel. These \ntwo  advantages  make  it  especially  suitable  for  vehicles  undertaking  long-distance  or \nheavy-duty trips, such as inter-city buses and trucks delivering cargo.  \n\nThird,  there  are  various  means  of  producing  hydrogen,  especially  from  clean  and \nindigenous sources, such as renewables, nuclear, biomass, and biofuel. This is critical \nfor  the  energy security  of countries  that  are  highly  reliant  on imports  of  fossil fuels  to \npower their transportation sector. Fourth, hydrogen is complementary to the PRC\u2019s move \nto electrify its land transport sector, which currently relies mostly on chemical batteries, \nsuch as lead-acid and lithium compound batteries. In this sense, hydrogen provides a \ncomplementary  solution  the  coupling  of  renewable  energy  and  transport.  This  is \nespecially the case as hydrogen provides a long-term option, such as seasonal storage \nfor renewable energy. \n\nHowever, in the Chinese context, the literature lacks an understanding of the economics \nof the hydrogen energy supply and its downstream applications, especially concerning \nthe various combinations of production, transportation, storage, and delivery pathways \nas  well  as  their  applications  in  different  local  scenarios  with  different  energy \nendowments,  spatial  structures  of  the  market,  and  users\u2019  patterns  of  usage  and \npreferences. It  is  also  necessary  to  quantify  the  implications  of various  policies,  such  \nas  subsidies,  tax  credits,  and  carbon  emission  benefits,  to  give  clear  signals  to  both \npotential investors of hydrogen infrastructure and policy makers. \n\nThis  study  develops  quantitative  models  to  conduct  economic  assessments  of  the \nfeasibility  of  producing  hydrogen  energy  from  renewable  energy  and  subsequently \napplying  it  in  the  road  transport  sector  in  the  PRC.  It  applies  a  well-to-wheel  (WTW) \nmodel to analyze the cost of hydrogen as storage for renewable energy, while it uses the \ntotal cost of ownership (TCO) model to analyze the cost of fuel cell vehicles\u2019 (FCEVs\u2019) \nmobility, using the hydrogen produced from renewables as fuel, in comparison with that \nof  alternative  vehicle  powertrains,  especially  the  conventional  fossil  fuel-based \ntechnology. Specifically, the study customizes these models for application scenarios in \nthe context of the PRC in terms of energy prices, the power generation mix, the power \ntransmission  and  distribution  system,  the  pattern  of  energy  demand,  the  pattern  of \nvehicle usage, taxation, and subsidies. \n\nThe WTW model provides estimations of the cost of hydrogen delivered at the refilling \nstations in $/kg of H2 as well as the carbon emissions of FCEVs in kg of CO2/km. The \nTCO model  gives  estimations  of the cost  of  owning  and  using  FCEVs  in $/km.  A  rich \nbody  of  literature, such  as Pereira  and  Coelho\u2019s  (2013) study,  has  addressed  the life \ncycle  analysis  of  energy  consumption  and  carbon  emissions  of  hydrogen  supply \npathways. Since one of the most imminent policy issues in the PRC is how to absorb the \nmassive  curtailment  of  renewable  energy,  especially  that  from  wind,  solar,  and \nsometimes even hydropower, our study contributes to the literature and addresses the \npolicy issue by focusing on the production of hydrogen from curtailed renewable energy \nin  the  PRC.  Therefore, the  \u201cwell\u201d  part  of  our  study starts  with  the  curtailed  renewable \nelectricity rather than the construction of renewable energy farms.  \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nThe TCO model mainly aims to address the policy issue of the size of the gap between \nusers\u2019  costs  of  FCEVs  with  hydrogen sourced  from  curtailed  renewables and those  of \nalternative  powertrain  technologies,  such  as  battery  electric  vehicles  (BEVs),  plug-in \nhybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). It therefore \ndirectly  reflects  the  extent  to  which  the  government  should  provide  subsidies,  tax \nrecessions, or other incentives for the use of FCEVs at the current stage of development \nof this technology. Moreover, it is possible to extend the scope of the discussion to the \nexternalities  or  the  social  cost  of  FCEVs  compared  with  other  types  of  vehicles  by \napplying a benchmark cost of carbon emissions. \n\nThis  study  delivers  the  following  key  findings.  (1)  Hydrogen  as  energy  storage  for \nrenewable  energy  in  the  Chinese  power  sector  is  not  economically  competitive  yet. \nPartially this is due to the regulated pricing of electricity in the PRC. (2) Hydrogen as a \nfuel  for  passenger  fuel  cell  vehicles  is  already  competitive  due  to  the  substantial \nsubsidies  that  the  government  currently  provides.  (3)  However,  this  is  not  the  case \nregarding fuel cell buses and trucks. More support for the R&D of both these technologies \nmight  be  important  to  reduce  their  CAPEX  meaningfully.  (4)  Additional  fuel  taxes  on \nconventional fossil fuel, carbon tax, and carbon emission trading could also significantly \nimprove the competitiveness of clean or zero-emission hydrogen energy. \n\nThe rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 contains a literature review. Section \n3  presents  the  methodology  and  data.  Section  4  discusses  the  findings  from  our \nmodeling analysis. Finally, section 5 concludes and draws policy implications. \n\n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nThe  study  reports  the  literature  review  in  three  subsections:  1\u2014upstream:  hydrogen \ntransportation  and  delivery  of  hydrogen;  and  \nproduction;  2\u2014mid-stream: \n3\u2014downstream: applications of hydrogen as energy. \n\n2.1  Upstream: Hydrogen Production \n\nFirst, at the production stage, especially regarding hydrogen produced from electrolysis, \nthere  are two main  cost  drivers:  one  is the  high capital cost  of  production  equipment, \nsuch as electrolyzers; the second is the cost of energy, especially electricity (Rahil 2017). \nDistinguishing electricity by its sources, the cost of electrolysis using renewable energy \ncould \nthe  \ncost of production in distributed hydrogen production is higher than that of centralized \nlarge-scale  production.  The  latter comes  with  a  significant  economy  of scale.  Table  1 \nsummarizes the findings regarding the cost of hydrogen production from the literature. \n\nelectricity,  while \n\nthat  using \n\nbe  much \n\nhigher \n\nthan \n\ngrid \n\nSeveral international organizations have provided cross-country comparisons of the cost \nof  hydrogen  production.  The  Asia  Pacific  Energy  Research  Centre  (APERC)  (2018) \nfound significant differences in the cost of hydrogen production following various paths. \nFor  example,  hydrogen  production  using  electricity  from  solar  PV  costs  USD6.65/kg, \n6.02/kg,  4.12/kg,  and  3.7/kg  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Japan,  the  PRC,  and  the  US, \nrespectively; hydrogen production using electricity from wind power costs USD6.65/kg, \n5.66/kg,  4.21/kg,  and  3.99/kg  in the  Republic  of Korea,  Japan, the PRC, and  the  US, \nrespectively.  Among  all  the  pathways  that  use  renewables  to  produce  hydrogen,  the \nlowest costs come from hydropower in New Zealand and Canada, at USD2.69/kg and \n2.66/kg, respectively. For the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels, the cost of coal \ngasification  with  carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  falls  into  the  range  between \nreforming  \nUSD2.27/kg  and  USD2.61/kg \n\nin  various  countries.  Natural  gas \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nwith  CCS  has  the  lowest  costs  among  the  fossil  fuel  pathways,  ranging  between \nUSD0.78/kg (in the Russian Federation) to USD1.49/kg (in the US).  \n\nTable 1: The Estimated Cost of Hydrogen Production from the Recent Literature \n\n \n\nJames, \nDeSantis, \nand Saur \n(2016) \n \n\nCountry/ \nRegion \n\nEnergy \nSource \n\nUS \n\nGrid electricity \n\nType of Technology \n\nEstimated Cost \n\nLarge-scale centralized; \nproton exchange membrane \n(PEM) electrolyzer \n\nUSD4.20\u20135.11/kg \n\nExpected \nFuture Cost \n\nUS \n\nGrid electricity \n\nUSD3.82\u20134.96/kg \n\nLarge-scale centralized; solid \noxide electrolysis cell \n(SOEC) \n\nSmall-scale on-site; proton \nexchange membrane (PEM) \nelectrolyzer \n\nSmall-scale on-site; molten \ncarbonate fuel cell (MCFC) \n\nLarge-scale centralized; \nbiomass fermentation \n\nUS \n\nGrid electricity \n\nUSD4.23\u20135.14/kg \n\nUS \n\nUS \n\nGrid electricity \n\nBiomass \n\nUSD2.58\u20133.71/kg \n\nUSD51/kg \n\nUSD5.65/kg  \n(by 2025) \n\nRahil (2017) \n\nCanada  Medium-scale \n\nOn-site electrolysis \n\nUSD9.0/kg \n\nLibya \n\nOn-site electrolysis \n\nGBP9.3\u201310.4/kg \n\nGBP6.2\u2013\n6.6/kg (by \n2030) \n\nRahil, \nGammon, \nand Brown \n(2018) \n\nMiller, Raju, \nand Roy \n(2017) \n\nUS \n\nUS \n\nwind power \n\nSmall-scale \nwind power \n\nNatural gas, \nsolar PV, and \nbiomass \n\nNatural gas, \ngrid electricity, \nand biomass \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 summary based on the literature. \n\nLarge-scale SMR, \nelectrolysis, and gasification \n\nOn-site distributed production  USD2.03/kg,  \n\nUSD1.89/kg,  \n6.16/kg, and 2.5/kg, \nrespectively \n\n5.75/kg, and \n3.32/kg, respectively \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe IEA (2019) estimated the cost of hydrogen production through several pathways in \nthe PRC. Hydrogen produced from coal has the lowest cost, at USD1.1/kg; if applying \nCCS, then the cost increases to USD1.6/kg. Natural gas reforming costs USD1.8/kg, and \nit increases to USD2.3/kg if applying CCS. Hydrogen produced from electrolysis using \nrenewables costs about USD3.0/kg, while it costs USD5.4/kg if using grid electricity. \n\n2.2  Mid-stream: Transportation and Delivery of Hydrogen \n\nBesides  the  cost  of  hydrogen  production,  the  infrastructure  and  network  for  the \ntransportation, storage, delivery, and refilling of hydrogen are also costly and to a large \nextent decide the cost of hydrogen to end-users. Currently, mainstream technologies for \nthe  transportation  and  delivery  of  hydrogen  include  pipelines,  compressed  hydrogen, \nliquefied hydrogen, and a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC).  \n\nThe  US  Department  of  Energy  (2015)  estimated  the  cost  of  hydrogen  transportation, \ndelivery, and refilling using the HDSAM tool that the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) \ndeveloped  as  follows:  (1)  pipeline  (100  km):  USD4.85/kg;  (2)  compressed  hydrogen \ntrailer (283 km): USD3.30/kg; and (3) liquid hydrogen trailer (283 km): USD3.25/kg. \n\nReu\u00df et al. (2017) estimated the cost of hydrogen transportation and delivery with trans-\nseasonal  storage  for  60  days.  By  mixing  the  use  of  compressed  hydrogen,  liquid \nhydrogen,  and  an  LOHC  for  different  sections  of  the  supply  chain,  the  costs  of \ntransportation and delivery range from 4.5 euro/kg to 6.5/kg. The hydrogen production \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\ncapacity  assumption in  this  study  is  50 tonnes/day,  with  a transportation and  delivery \ndistance of 250 km. \n\nAPERC  (2018)  studied  the  scenarios  of  various  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nexporting hydrogen to Japan for subsequent uses in power generation applications and \nfuel  cell  electric  vehicle  (FCEV)  applications.  In  the  power  generation  application \nscenarios,  considering  the  transportation  of  hydrogen  in  liquid  form,  the  costs  of \ntransportation from  Indonesia,  Australia, the  US,  and the  Russian Federation  reached \nUSD2.23/kg,  2.51/kg,  2.3/kg,  and  1.76/kg,  respectively.  In  the  case  of  FCEV \napplications, it is necessary to consider the cost of hydrogen refilling stations; therefore, \nthe  final cost  of  hydrogen  to  the  end-user  reached  USD12.6/kg  if the  hydrogen  came \nfrom solar PV-based production in Indonesia. The final user cost of hydrogen reached \nUSD8.28/kg  in  the  case  of  hydrogen  from  natural  gas  reforming  in  the  Russian \nFederation. \n\nThe IEA (2019) studied the case of Australia exporting hydrogen to Japan. The estimated \ncost of liquid hydrogen transportation is USD3.2/kg. Using an LOHC and ammonia for \nthe  transportation  of  hydrogen  could  reduce  the  cost  to  USD2.2/kg  and  USD1.6/kg, \nrespectively.  \n\nIt  is  thus  possible  to  observe  that  factors  such  as  the  geographical  conditions,  the \ndistance of transportation, and the choice of transportation technologies result in the cost \nof transportation and delivery varying significantly among different regions and different \ncountries and in different application scenarios. At this moment, there is a general lack \nin  \nof \nthe PRC. \n\ntransportation  and  delivery \n\nthe  cost  of  hydrogen \n\nliterature  about \n\n2.3  Downstream: Applications of Hydrogen as Energy \n\nLast  but  not  least,  we  review  the  cost  matters  in the  downstream,  which involves  the \napplication  of  hydrogen  energy,  including  the  power  sector,  the  heat  supply,  and  the \ntransport sector. The key is whether hydrogen energy applications could compete with \nconventional energy in these sectors. If not, what are the future cost targets for hydrogen \nenergy to become competitive? \n\nThe Fuel Cell Technology Office of the US Department of Energy started to make and \nroutinely renew its MYRD&D (Multi-Year Research, Development, and Demonstration) \nin  2003.  According  to  this  office,  when  meeting  the  following  cost  targets,  hydrogen \nenergy will become competitive: \n\nA.  The total supply cost, namely the cost including the production cost and the cost \nof transportation and delivery, should be lower than USD4.0/kg, in which the cost \nof transportation and delivery is lower than USD2.0/kg; \n\nB.  The  capital  cost  of  the  electrolyzer  system  becomes  lower  than  USD300/kW, \n\nwhile its conversion efficiency reaches as high as 77%; \n\nC.  The cost of the fuel cell system becomes lower than USD40/kW by 2020, with \npeak efficiency reaching 65% and a life expectancy of 5,000 hours. Eventually, \nthe cost of the system reaches USD30/kW, with life expectancy of 8,000 hours. \n\nD.  Vehicles\u2019 onboard hydrogen storage reaches as low as USD10/kWh by 2020 and \n\neventually converges to USD8/kWh. \n\n \n\nIn  Japan,  as  APERC  (2018)  showed,  the  total  supply  cost  of  hydrogen  should  be  \nas  low  as  USD1.92/kg\u2013USD3.23/kg  to  compete  with  coal-fired  power  generation.  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nTo  compete  with  power  generation  using  LNG,  it  needs  to  reach  USD2.04/kg\u2013\nUSD2.64/kg. In the transport sector, it needs to be as low as USD1.32/kg to compete \nwith conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). \n\nHydrogen Europe (2018), a European hydrogen and fuel cell association affiliated with \nthe European Union, expected the cost of electrolyzer to fall to 720 euro/kW by 2025 so \nthat  the  cost  of  hydrogen  production  by  electrolysis  reaches  5  euro/kg.  After  2030,  it \nexpected that large-scale applications of hydrogen technologies could help to reduce the \ncost  of  the  electrolyzer  to  as  little  as  500  euro/kW,  therefore  reducing  the  cost  of \nhydrogen production to 3 euro/kg. On the hydrogen storage front, if the capital cost of \nlarge-scale hydrogen storage could reach 5 euro/kWh, which is 1/100 of the current cost \nof battery storage, it will become economically competitive. The capital cost of distributed \nhydrogen storage should reach 10 euro/kWh. On the transportation and delivery front, \nthere is an expectation that all pathways will reach cost levels lower than 1 euro/kg by \n2030.  Around \nreach  \n50 euro/kW, so the capital cost of hydrogen storage and fuel cell systems for a passenger \nvehicle (FCEV) becomes lower than 5,000 euro, while that of a bus becomes lower than \n40,000 euro. \n\nthe  capital  cost  of \n\nfuel  cells  will \n\nthe  same \n\ntime, \n\nIn the East Asian region, according to the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and \nEast Asia  (ERIA)  (2019),  in the  power  sector,  if  only  considering  the cost,  insurance, \nfreight  (CIF)  cost  of  imported  energy,  including  hydrogen  and  other  types  of  energy, \nhydrogen  should  be  as  cheap  as  USD0.53/kg\u2013USD0.85/kg  to  compete  with  coal.  It \nneeds to reach USD1.29/kg\u2013USD 1.41/kg to compete with natural gas. Regarding the \napplication  of  hydrogen  in the  industry sector, taking  Japan  as  an  example,  hydrogen \nneeds to reach USD1.69/kg\u2013USD1.99/kg to compete with natural gas.  \n\nreach  USD4.24/kg\u2013USD5.0/kg \n\nIn the transport sector, if only considering the comparison of fuel costs, hydrogen needs \nin  \nto \nJapan.  In  the  case  of  Indonesia,  the  competitive  range  of  the  hydrogen  cost  is \nUSD3.78/kg\u2013USD4.53/kg. As Li (2019a) and Li (2019b) further pointed out, according to \nthe  ERIA  report,  considering  the  high  capital  cost  of  FCEVs  and  the  high  cost  \nof  hydrogen supply  together,  the  per  km  cost  of  FCEV  usage  is  twice  as high  as that  \nof ICEV usage. \n\nto  compete  with  conventional \n\nICEVs \n\nTherefore,  the  study  can  conclude  that,  to  achieve  competitiveness  for  large-scale \ncommercial  application,  hydrogen  energy  needs  further  efforts  from  at  least  three \naspects:  \n\n1.  more  continuous  investment  in  RD&D  to  improve  technical  performances  and \n\nreduce costs through technological improvements;  \n\n2.  prioritization of the development of early markets and niche markets for hydrogen \nenergy  applications to  benefit  from the  learning  effects,  the  economy  of scale, \nand  the  network  effect  of  the  hydrogen  energy  infrastructure  and  thus  reduce \ncosts accordingly; and \n\n3.  sufficient  and  supportive  policies  that  favor  the  development  and  adoption  of \nhydrogen energy and fuel cell technologies. In this regard, it is possible to refer \nto the policies that countries have adopted to support BEVs as examples.  \n\n3.  METHODOLOGY AND DATA \n\nThis  study  aims  firstly  to  investigate  the  economics  of  hydrogen  produced  from \nrenewable  energy  as  an  energy  application  for  the  road  transport  sector  in  the  PRC. \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nSpecifically, it will estimate the cost of producing hydrogen from renewable energy, the \nlogistics costs of transporting and storing hydrogen, and eventually the cost of refueling \nvehicles with hydrogen at the hydrogen station. Then it will compare the application of \nFCEVs  with  vehicles  with  alternative  powertrains,  such  as  battery  electric  vehicles \n(BEVs),  plug-in  hybrid  electric  vehicles  (PHEV)/hybrid  electric  vehicles  (HEVs),  and \nconventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). \n\nThe  study  develops  WTW  cost  models,  as  well  as  TCO  models,  covering  both  the \nupstream and the downstream of the hydrogen economy, to simulate various scenarios, \nassuming  different  technologies  and  industrial  processes  of  hydrogen  production \npathways, different energy endowments that determine the mix of hydrogen production \nand the costs of primary energy inputs, different usages of vehicles in various fleets, and \ncountry-specific  energy  policies,  such  as  taxes,  surcharges,  and  subsidies  applied  to \nconventional  as  well  as  new  energy  products  and  technologies.  Scenarios  containing \nreasonable assumptions about the above-mentioned key factors will be able to indicate \nprecisely  the  economic  and  commercial  feasibility  of  establishing  hydrogen  supply \nchains. \n\nFigure  1  illustrates  the  key  features  and  factors  that  a  WTW  model  for  the  hydrogen \nsupply  chain  captures.  The  specification  of  a  hydrogen  supply  chain  starts  with  \nthe  choice  of  centralized  production  mode  or  forecourt  production  mode.  The  former \nrequires transport and delivery infrastructure, while the latter involves on-site production \nat the location of catering. This model considers important features such as the utilization \nrate,  the  transport,  storage,  and  delivery  pathway,  the  corresponding  capacity  and \noperation of infrastructure, the energy consumption of the supply chain, and the cost of \nenergy inputs. \n\nFigure 1: Key Features and Factors that the WTW Model  \nfor the Hydrogen Supply Chain Captures \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 depiction. \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nFigure 2: Key Input and Output of a TCO Model for Vehicles \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 depiction. \n\nFigure 2 presents the key input and output of a TCO model for FCEVs as well as other \ncompeting  powertrains.

RESULTS AND FINDINGS \n\n4.1  TCO Analysis \n\nFirstly,  we  specify  a  scenario  of  transportation  and  delivery  as  the  domestic  medium \ndistance  of  100  km  from  the  centralized  production  site  of  hydrogen  to  the  hydrogen \nrefilling stations.  The transportation  and  delivery  process  involves  a  hydrogen storage \nfacility  that  has  a  capacity  equivalent  to  7  days  of  the  system\u2019s  maximum  hydrogen \nproduction. \n\nAccordingly,  the  study  estimates  the  total  cost  of  hydrogen  supplied  at  the  refilling \nstations, through different transportation and delivery pathways, as follows (Table 5). \n\nTable 5: The Estimated Total Cost of Hydrogen Supplied  \n($/kg) \n\n \nSolar PV \nWind \nHydropower \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nPipeline \n5.67 \n6.30 \n5.74 \n\nCompressed \nHydrogen Truck \n6.27 \n6.96 \n6.41 \n\nLiquid Hydrogen \nTruck \n19.50 \n20.80 \n19.78 \n\nLOHC Truck \n8.06 \n8.96 \n8.24 \n\nWith such hydrogen prices at the refilling station, Table 6 presents the cost per km of \nFCEV  usage  in  three-vehicle  fleets  in  the  PRC,  namely  passenger  cars,  buses,  and \ntrucks,  using  the  TCO  model  and  applying  hydrogen  sourced  from  solar  energy.  The \nTCO in terms of $/km includes the CAPEX, OPEX, and fuel costs. \n\nTable 6: Total Cost of Ownership of FCEVs in the PRC  \n(Hydrogen Sourced from Solar PV)  \n($/km) \n\n \nPassenger Cars \nBuses \nTrucks \n\nPipeline \n0.295 \n3.495 \n3.082 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nCompressed \nHydrogen Truck \n0.303 \n3.576 \n3.189 \n\nLiquid Hydrogen \nTruck \n0.479 \n5.352 \n5.545 \n\nLOHC Truck \n0.327 \n3.815 \n3.507 \n\nThese  could  be  compared  with  the  TCO  of  vehicles  (of  a  typical  and  comparable \nspecification,  such  as  engine  power)  with  alternative  powertrains,  including  BEVs, \nPHEV/HEVs, and ICEVs (Table 7). \n\nTable 7: Total Cost of Ownership of Vehicles with Alternative Powertrains  \nin the PRC  \n($/km) \n\n \n\nPassenger Car \nBus \nTruck \n\nBEV \n0.466 \n1.607 \n0.858 \n\nPHEV/HEV \n0.561 \n2.085 \n0.944 \n\nICEV \n0.414 \n1.733 \n1.017 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nIt  is  thus  observable  that,  first,  FCEVs  in  general  are  not  competitive  against  other \npowertrains, not even BEVs. Second, however, due to the generous subsidies for fuel \ncell passenger cars that the government announced in 2019, which amount to around \n$57,000  per  vehicle,  they  already  appear  to  be  competitive  with  other  powertrains, \nincluding ICEVs.  However, these  are the subsidies  that the  Chinese central  and local \ngovernment can offer on a small scale for demonstration purposes. It is highly unlikely \nthat such generous subsidies could continue as fuel cell passenger cars come into large-\nscale commercial use. \n\nTo determine the role played by the fuel cost, namely the total supply cost of hydrogen, \nwe conduct the following sensitivity analysis. Figure 4 presents the comparison of energy \ncost sensitivity scenarios for passenger cars. Figure 5 presents the comparison for buses \nand Figure 6 the comparison for trucks. \n\nFigure 4: Hydrogen Cost Sensitivity Scenarios (TCO of Passenger Cars) ($/km) \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nFigure 5: Hydrogen Cost Sensitivity Scenarios (TCO of Buses)  \n($/km) \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\n \n\nIt is apparent that, although the variation in hydrogen costs could significantly influence \nthe  economic  competitiveness  of  FCEVs,  non-fuel costs still  determine  the  majority  of \nthe  TCO  for  FCEVs,  namely  the  CAPEX  and  non-fuel  OPEX  of  the  vehicles  per  se. \nTherefore,  while it  is  important to make sure that  the cost  of supplying  hydrogen  falls \nsubstantially in the future, it is even more important that FCEV technologies and related \nindustries make substantial progress in reducing the CAPEX of the vehicles. \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nFigure 6: Hydrogen Cost Sensitivity Scenarios (TCO of Trucks)  \n($/km) \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\n4.2  Carbon Emissions of FCEVs \n\nOur  WTW  model  also  estimates  the  carbon  dioxide  emission  levels  of  road  transport \nvehicles in the three different fleets. Table 8 presents the estimations of the emissions \nof FCEVs in the case of the PRC, with hydrogen sourced from electricity produced using \nsolar PV. We compare this with the carbon dioxide emission levels of BEVs, PHEVs, and \nICEVs  in  the  PRC  in  Table  9.  We  estimate  the  numbers  based  on  common  vehicle \nmodels available in the market. In the case of BEVs, since it is typically impossible to \nearmark the electricity that they use as coming from specific clean energy sources, we \napply the carbon emissions of grid electricity in the PRC. \n\nTable 8: Carbon Emissions of FCEVs in the Three Fleets  \n(kg/km) \n\n \nPassenger Cars \nBuses \nTrucks \n\nPipeline \n0.036 \n0.344 \n0.457 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nCompressed \nHydrogen Truck \n0.038 \n0.366 \n0.486 \n\nLiquid Hydrogen \nTruck \n0.118 \n1.174 \n1.556 \n\nLOHC Truck \n0.042 \n0.406 \n0.538 \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nTable 9: Carbon Emissions of BEVs, PHEVs, and ICEVs in the Three Fleets  \n(kg/km) \n\n \n\nBEVs \n\nPHEVs \n\nICEVs \n\nPassenger Cars \nBuses \nTrucks \n\n0.084 \n0.714 \n0.700 \n\n0.149 \n0.898 \n0.937 \n\n0.132 \n1.586 \n1.219 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nComparing  Tables  8  and  9,  we  can  see  that,  with  hydrogen  sourced  from  electricity \nproduced using solar PV, hydrogen supplied through most pathways, such as pipelines, \ncompressed  hydrogen,  and  LOHCs,  present  the  lowest  levels  of  carbon  dioxide \nemissions among all the powertrain technologies. Thus, the concept of FCEVs powered \nby  hydrogen  sourced  from  renewables  is  indeed  a  desirable  low-carbon  emission \nsolution. In the case of liquefied hydrogen, we note that the economies of scale should \nalso  be  able  to  play  a  significant  role  in  driving  down  the  carbon  emissions  once  the \nmassive scale of hydrogen production and application takes place. \n\nShould a carbon emission price be imposed on vehicles\u2019 emissions, say, at about $13/ton \nof CO2 in the Beijing carbon emission exchange, the highest level among the regional \nexchanges  in  the  PRC,  we  can  calculate  the  real  or  social  cost  of  FCEVs\u2019,  BEVs\u2019, \nPHEVs\u2019, and ICEVs\u2019 carbon emissions, as Table 10 shows. \n\nTable 10: Cost of Carbon Emissions by FCEVs, BEVs, PHEVs, and ICEVs  \n($/km) \n\n \n\nPassenger Cars \nBuses \nTrucks \n\nFCEVs  \n(Pipeline Pathway) \n0.0005 \n0.0044 \n0.0059 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nBEVs \n0.0011 \n0.0093 \n0.0091 \n\nPHEVs \n0.002 \n0.012 \n0.012 \n\nICEVs \n0.002 \n0.021 \n0.016 \n\nAccording to Table 10, although the carbon emission costs of FCEVs are much lower \nthan those  of  the  alternatives,  at the  current  levels  of carbon  prices,  users can  hardly \nnotice the existence of the carbon cost when using conventional vehicles, since it is less \nthan 1% of the TCO, even when imposing such a social cost of the externality. In other \nwords, carbon prices need to increase by more than 10 times the current levels to make \nthe environmental externality visible to users of vehicles. \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nIn this study, we examined the relationship between the energy prices and the feasibility \nof using hydrogen energy for road transport in the PRC, especially focusing on hydrogen \nas  energy storage  for  renewables.  We  established  a  WTW  model to  analyze the  total \ncost  of  supplying  hydrogen  refilling  stations  with  hydrogen  from  renewable  energy \nsources for vehicle use purposes. Subsequently, we built a TCO model to analyze the \nper kilometer cost of owning and using an FCEV compared with alternative powertrains, \nsuch as BEVs, PHEV/HEVs, and ICEVs.  \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nWe found that, compared with the current common retail hydrogen prices at hydrogen \nrefilling stations operating in the PRC of around $12.2/kg, sourced from the purification \nof industrial byproduct hydrogen, hydrogen produced from all three sources of renewable \nenergy and using pipelines, compressed hydrogen trucks, and LOHC trucks for delivery \nis competitive. However, the cost of hydrogen at such levels barely enables FCEVs as \npassenger  cars  to  be  economically  competitive  compared  with  vehicles  with  other \npowertrains  given  that  both  the  central  and  the  local  government  in  the  PRC  provide \nsubstantial subsidies for the CAPEX of FCEVs. In the bus and truck fleet, FCEVs remain \nuncompetitive. In the case of FCEV buses, their TCO is about twice as high as that of \nconventional ICEV buses, while, in the case of FCEV trucks, their TCO is about three \ntimes as high as that of conventional ICEV trucks. \n\nIn our sensitivity analysis, with the cost of hydrogen varying in a range of 20% relative to \nthe benchmark, we showed that it affects the competitiveness of FCEVs only marginally. \nTherefore, the high CAPEX of the FCEVs, rather than hydrogen as the fuel cost, is the \nmain barrier to achieving competitiveness against alternative powertrains, especially in \nthe case of the bus and truck fleets. \n\nOur  study  thus  shows  that  passenger  FCEVs  are  already  competitive  against  other \nalternative  powertrains  in  the  PRC.  However,  this  depends  on  two  critical  conditions:  \n1.  the  generous  subsidies  for  passenger  FCEVs  continue;  2.  passenger  FCEVs  are \navailable in the PRC at prices comparable to the models on sale in developed countries, \nsuch as Japan, the US, and Europe. In fact, most of the passenger FCEV models in the \nPRC are at the concept or prototype stage, and their costs are some twofold that of the \nJapanese  models.  It  is  thus  recommendable  to  accelerate  the  development  of  the \npassenger FCEV supply chain in the PRC. \n\nAs  regards  the  FCEVs  for  the  bus  and  truck  fleets,  substantial  gaps  exist  in  terms  \nof  their  TCO  and  therefore  they  are  far  from  being  competitive  with  alternative \npowertrains. We propose that policy makers should consider leveling up the subsidies \nthat the government offers to FCEV buses and trucks while also expanding the support \nto intensify R&D in related technologies and supply chains. \n\nSo  far,  we  have  based  our  discussion  on  the  competitiveness  of  hydrogen  energy  \nand  its  fuel  cell  application  for  the  transport  sector  on  the  current  policy  framework  \nand  market  mechanisms.  We  note  that  we  have  not  included  the  economic  value  \nof  the  additional  services  that  hydrogen  provides  to  the  power  grid,  such  as  load \nmanagement, peak power supply, and energy storage services, since such mechanisms \ndo not exist in the PRC yet. Accordingly, we propose that policy makers should consider \ndeveloping such market mechanisms along with the pricing of carbon emissions that the \nPRC  is  developing  to  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  hydrogen  energy  further, \nespecially encouraging its coupling with renewable energy capacities. \n\nThis  study  has  focused  on  a  hydrogen  supply  chain  with  the  centralized  production \nmodel.  Future  research  should  extend  the  scope  to  analyze  the  economic  feasibility  \nof  a  hydrogen  supply  chain  with  distributed  production  since  distributed  renewables, \nespecially renewables integrated into the microgrid, are also developing fast globally and \nthe PRC is likely to follow such developments in the future.  \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1185 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nLi and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nAsia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC). 2018.
