INTRODUCTION \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nIndia is ranked very low in the global innovation index (81 out of 141 countries), which \nin  a  way  reflects  the  low  innovation  capacity  of  Indian  firms  and  Indian  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  particular.  The  Government  of  India  classifies \nSMEs  as  a  part  of  the  MSME  (micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprise)  sector. \nAccording  to  the  Ministry  of  MSME,  there  are  ~49  million  enterprises  in  the  MSME \nsector  that  employed  around  111.4  million  people  in  2014.  The  importance  of  the \nMSME  sector  to  the  Indian  economy  can  also  be  understood  by  the  fact  that  it \ncontributed 37.5% to India\u2019s GDP in the fiscal year beginning in 2012 (FY2012). Out of \nthis,  manufacturing  sector  MSMEs  contributed  ~7%  and  services  sector  MSMEs \ncontributed 30.5% to India\u2019s GDP in FY2012.  \n\nMSMEs also play a critical role in the manufacturing sector and the export performance \nof  India.  The  share  of  the  MSME  sector  in  total  manufacturing  output  for  FY2012  is \nestimated to be 37.3%. However, the share of the MSME sector in India\u2019s total exports \nfor FY2013 is 42.4%, which clearly shows the importance of this sector to the country\u2019s \nindustrial and economic growth. \n\nGiven  the  importance  of  the  MSME  sector,  it  is  critical  to  ensure  that  SMEs  in  India \nremain  competitive  both  nationally  and  globally.  One  of  the  principal  determinants  of \nSMEs\u2019  competitiveness  is  innovation.  Developing  economies  such  as  India  face  a \nformidable  challenge  in  this  regard  due  to  limited  government  capacity  to  foster \ninnovation  support  mechanisms.  Modern  concepts  such  as  cluster  development  are \noften underutilized or ignored.  \n\nGovernment policy\u2014which touches upon virtually every aspect of innovation including \naccess to finance, technology, market knowledge, and building of R&D and educational \ninstitutions\u2014remains one of the most crucial factors in SME innovation. \n\nIndia updated its Science, Technology and Innovation Policy in 2013. It is important to \nnote that the policy has provided a big impetus to build an innovation ecosystem and to \nenhance the role of the private sector to do the same. The Government of India, under \nthe  Ministry  of  MSME,  runs  various  schemes  and  programs  to  support  technological \ninnovation in Indian SMEs. The support extended by the government includes financial \nsubsidy  and  incentives  to  buy  machinery,  file  trademarks,  and  gain  access  to  tools \ntraining, and expert advice, among others.  \n\nThe  low  innovation  capacity  of  Indian  firms,  especially  SMEs,  has  widely  been \ndiscussed and debated. In spite of this, it is worthwhile to highlight that there are very \nfew  systematic  studies  that  have  tried  to  understand  innovation  in  Indian  SMEs. \nConsidering this in particular, the paper tries to answer the following key questions: \n\n1.  What is the current state of SME innovation in India including different types of \n\ninnovation activities, sources, and funding for innovation?  \n\n2.  What  are  the  key  barriers  that  hinder  SMEs  in  pursuing  innovation  and  their \n\nlikely impact? \n\n3.  How  is  the  current  science,  technology,  and  innovation  (STI)  ecosystem  and \ngovernment  policy  placed  in  India  to  support  SME  innovation?  Is  government \npolicy favorable or unfavorable?  \n\n4.  Are there any enablers that support or help SMEs innovate?  \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nThe  paper  starts  by  explaining  the  methodology  to  showcase  the  current  state  of \ninnovation  and  barriers  being  faced  by  Indian  SMEs.  It  then  discusses  the  existing \ninnovation  policy  framework  and  presents  the  key  challenges  and  enablers  of  SME \ninnovation.  It  concludes  by  presenting  key  policy  recommendations  to  improve  the \nnational innovation system and overall ecosystem for SME innovation in India.  \n\n2.  METHODOLOGY \n\nThis paper has adopted a mix of empirical analysis and literature review methodology. \nEmpirical analysis was used to assess the current state of innovation in SMEs in India \nalong  with  the  key  barriers  and  enablers.  A  comprehensive  review  of  public  policies \nand  government  support  programs  was  done  in  the  context  of  the  identified  barriers \nand enablers to devise effective policy suggestions or recommendations.  \n\nThe  empirical  data  used  in  this  paper  is  sourced  from  the  Indian  National  Innovation \nSurvey published by the Department of Science and Technology in 2014. The survey \ncovers 9,001 firms across 26 states and 5 union territories of India. These 9,001 firms \nare  taken  from  a  wider  database  of  208,415  firms  covered  in  a  2009\u20132010  survey  of \nindustries of India that was primarily focused on the manufacturing sector. As a result, \nthe  National  Innovation  Survey  mostly  includes  manufacturing  firms  and  hence  does \nnot  adequately  reflect  the  innovation  scenario  in  primary  and  tertiary  sectors  of  the \nIndian economy. \n\nSMEs in India are mainly classified on the basis of investment in plant and machinery \nor equipment, and not on the employee count (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1: Definition of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, India \n\n \n\nMicro enterprise \nSmall enterprise \n\nManufacturing Sector  \n(Investment in Plant and \nMachinery) \n\nDoes not exceed Rs2.5 million  \nMore than Rs2.5 million but does \nnot exceed Rs50 million \n\nMedium enterprise  More than Rs50 million but does \n\nnot exceed Rs100 million \n\nServices Sector  \n(Investment in Equipment) \n\nDoes not exceed Rs1 million  \nMore than Rs1 million but does not \nexceed Rs20 million \nMore than Rs20 million but does \nnot exceed Rs50 million \n\nRs = Indian rupee. \n\nSource: Government of India, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. \n\nThe  Indian  National  Innovation  Survey,  however,  does  not  collect  information  or \nclassify firms on the basis of the investments in plants and machinery. It classifies and \ndefines  the  firms  by  workforce  size.  The  firms  with  fewer  than  100  employees  are \ndefined  as  small  firms,  those  with  100\u2013499  are  defined  as  medium  firms,  those  with \n500\u2013999 are defined as medium-large firms, and those with 1,000 or more employees \nare defined as large firms. Out of the total 9,001 firms, 88.1% were small firms, 10.2% \nwere  medium  firms,  1.1%  were  medium-large  firms,  and  0.6%  were  large  firms \n(Table 2).  \n\nFor  the  purpose  of  this  paper,  only  small  and  medium-sized  firms  (fewer  than \n500 employees)  are  considered  to  reflect  upon  the  current  state  of  innovation  among \nSMEs  in  India.  This  means  that  only  8,846  firms  are  being  considered  out  of  9,001 \n(Table  2).  The  data  is  segregated  by  small  and  medium  firms  to  help  identify  key \ndifferences in the innovation behavior between the two. It is important to note that firms \nwith fewer than 100 employees also include the micro firms. However, for the purposes \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nof this paper it is assumed that micro firms, especially in manufacturing, do not engage \nin significant innovation activities.  \n\nTable 2: Sample Size in Indian National Innovation Survey by Size of Firm \n(employee size) \n\n% of Sample \n\nNumber of Firms in Sample \n\nFirm Size \nSmall firms (below 100 employees) \nMedium firms (100\u2013499) \nMedium to large (500\u2013999) \nLarge firms (1,000 and above) \nTotal firms \n\n88.1% \n10.2% \n1.1% \n0.6% \n100% \n\n7,928 \n918 \n96 \n59 \n9,001 \n\nSource: Government of India, Department of Science and Technology. 2014. Indian National Innovation Survey. \n\nThe  Indian  National  Innovation  Survey  does  collect  information  on  barriers  faced  by \nSMEs pertaining to innovation by different types of firms. The small and medium firms \n(employee size <500) only are considered to study the barriers to innovation in order to \ntruly  reflect  the  SMEs  characteristics  and  behavior.  Simple  percentages  are  used  to \nillustrate  the  impact  of  various  barriers  on  innovative  small  and  medium  firms.  It  is \nimportant  to  note  that  the  majority  of  the  data  analysis  discussed  in  the  subsequent \nsections  is  focused  only  on  the  innovative  firms.  In  the  case  of  institutional  access, \nthough,  all  the  innovative  firms  (small,  medium,  and  large)  are  included  because  of \ndata availability challenges.  \n\nThe  National  Innovation  Survey  followed  the  guidelines  for  collecting  and  interpreting \ninnovation  as  published  in  the  Oslo  manual  (OECD  2005).  The  survey  adopted  the \nsubjective  approach,  which  is  based  on  the  firm\u2019s  or  production  unit\u2019s  identification  of \nchanges  made  in  the  product  and  process.  The  definitions  of  innovation,  innovation \nactivities, and innovative firms in the innovation survey have been directly adopted from \nthe Oslo manual and are referenced below: \n\nInnovation:  \u201cAn  innovation  is  the  implementation  of  a  new  or  significantly  improved \nproduct  (good  or  service),  process,  new  marketing  method  or  new  organizational \nmethod in business practices, workplace organization or external relations.\u201d  \n\ntechnological, \nInnovation/Innovative  activities: \norganizational,  financial  and  commercial  steps  which  actually  or  are  intended  to,  lead \nthe implementation of innovation.\u201d  \n\nincludes  all \n\nscientific, \n\n\u201cIt \n\nInnovative firm: \u201cA firm which implements an innovation is called as innovative firm.\u201d  \n\n3.  CURRENT STATE OF INNOVATION AMONG  \n\nINDIAN SMES \n\nAs per the Indian National Innovation Survey, innovative firms are defined as follows: \n\n\u201cFirms  that  report  different  changes  in  their  production,  organizational  and  marketing \npractices and are engaged in innovative activities.\u201d  \n\nThe different types of innovations reported by the survey respondents include product \ninnovation,  process  innovation,  product  quality  and  standardization,  savings  or  more \nefficient use of inputs, use of alternative material in production, and installation of new \nmachines.  Around  35.2%  of  SMEs  are  found  to  be  innovative  in  the  survey  and  are \nengaged in different innovation activities (Table 3). Medium-sized firms are found to be \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nmore  innovative  than  small  firms,  possibly  due  to  their  larger  size  and  capacity  to \nundertake innovative activities. \n\nTable 3: Innovative Firms by Employee Size \n\nFirm Size \nSmall firms (below 100 employees) \nMedium firms (100\u2013499) \nTotal SMEs \n\nNumber in \nSample \n7,928 \n918 \n8,846 \n\nInnovative \nFirms \n2,736 \n376 \n3,112 \n\n% of Innovative Firms \nin the Sample \n34.5 \n40.1 \n35.2 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on Indian National Innovation Survey, 2014. Figures are indicative. \n\nThe majority of the innovative SMEs are found to be buying new machines, followed by \npracticing  product  quality  and  standardization  as  a  part  of  their  innovation  process \n(Figure  1).  It  is  also  very  evident  from  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  the  firms  in  the \nInnovation  Survey  are  manufacturing  firms.  Medium  firms  are  found  to  be  performing \nmarginally better than small firms in almost all form of innovations.  \n\nFigure 1: Percentage of Innovative Small and Medium Firms  \nPursuing Different Innovations \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on Indian National Innovation Survey, 2014. Figures are indicative. \n\n \n\nFirms  undertake  innovation  in  pursuit  of  some  specific  outcomes.  These  may  include \nincreased  productivity,  enhanced  competitive  position,  reduced  costs,  and  meeting \nregulatory  compliance  in  a  more  effective  manner,  among  others.  Each  type  of \ninnovation is generally linked to specific gains, which serve as the main motivation and \nreason for the SMEs to innovate.  \n\nMore than 70% of the innovative small and medium firms gained in terms of increased \nrange  of  goods  and  services  and  improvements  in  quality  as  a  result  of  product \ninnovation.  However,  innovative  medium  firms  benefited  more  in  comparison  with \ninnovative small firms for entering new markets or increasing market share (Figure 2).  \n\nTalking  about  the gains from  process  innovations,  innovative  medium firms  are found \nto be better placed than small firms to increase capacity and flexibility in production and \nto  reduce  input  costs.  The  highest  impact  of  process  innovation  is  however  seen  in \nterms of enhanced production capacity (Figure 3).  \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nFigure 2: Product Innovation Outcomes\u2014Percentage of Innovative SMEs \n\nThe image cannot be displayed.

Figures are indicative. \n\nThe  above  figures  clearly  point  out  that  the  gains  from  innovations  for  SMEs  can  \nbe  multifold  and  cross-sectional.  For  instance,  any  process  improvement  can  \nresult  in  more  productivity  and  lower  waste  generation,  resulting  in  reduced  costs  \nand  environmental  hazards.  Hence,  there  is  a  clear  business  case  for  SMEs  to  be \nmore innovative.  \n\nThe  changes  implemented  by  the  firms  in  pursuit  of  innovation  are  attributed  to \ndifferent  innovation  activities.  Such  activities  pursued  by  SMEs  can  be  of  two  types: \nresearch  and  development  (R&D)  innovation  activities  and  non-R&D  innovation \nactivities. R&D-based innovation activities can be either intramural or extramural. Non-\nR&D innovation activities include acquisition of technology or new machinery, external \nknowledge, introduction of products to markets, and workforce training.  \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nSMEs  generally  lack  the  financial  capacity  and  staff  to  undertake  structured  and \nsophisticated R&D and hence are more likely to engage in non-R&D innovation. This is \nespecially  the  case  in  developing  economies  such  as  India.  More  than  50%  of \ninnovative small and medium firms are engaged in non-R&D innovation. Medium firms \nare  found  to  be  more  engaged  in  intramural  R&D  as  compared  with  small  firms. \nHowever,  the  performance  in  extramural  R&D  is  dismal  for  both  small  and  medium \nfirms,  showcasing  the  lack  of  access  and  interaction  with  research  institutions, \nlaboratories,  and  public  and  private  universities  (Table  4).  This  infers  and  also  points \ntoward the biggest challenges SMEs face to access the formal R&D innovations.  \n\nTable 4: Innovation Activities by Innovative Small and Medium Firms \n\nFirm Size \n\nSmall firms \nMedium firms \n\nNon-R&D Innovation \n(%) \n65 \n54 \n\nIntramural R&D \n(%) \n33 \n45 \n\nExtramural R&D \n(%) \n11 \n12 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on Indian National Innovation Survey, 2014. Figures are indicative. \n\nIt  is  evident from Table 4  that  non-R&D  innovations  are the most  common  innovation \nphenomena among Indian SMEs. More than 66% of innovative small and medium firms \nare  engaged  in  the  acquisition  of  technology,  mostly  in  the  form  of  new  machines. \nManufacturing firms are more likely to invest in technology upgrades in their production \nprocess to help expand their market while reducing input costs. Medium firms perform \nmarginally  better  than  smaller  firms  in  acquiring  external  knowledge  and  introducing \ninnovative  products  and  services  to  market.  However,  these  forms  of  innovation  are \nmuch less common than technology acquisition among the innovative SMEs (Figure 4). \n\nIn  terms  of  non-R&D  innovative  activities,  medium-sized  innovative  firms  perform \nmarginally  better  than  small  innovative  firms  (Table  5).  The  acquisition  of  external \nknowledge  mainly  comes  in  the  form  of  patented  technology,  know-how,  and  trade \nsecrets, among others.  \n\nFigure 4: Non-R&D Innovation Activities Conducted by Innovative SMEs \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on Indian National Innovation Survey, 2014. Figures are indicative. \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nThere  is  a  much  lower  but  still  significant  percentage  of  innovative  SMEs  that  are \nengaged in introducing their innovative products in the markets. There seems to be a \nclose  link  between  the  acquisition  of  external  knowledge  and  market  introduction  of \ninnovations, as the former can be used to launch the new products. The acquisition of \nexternal knowledge tends to have a significant impact on SMEs as it is directly coupled \nwith  the  overall  product  and  market  strategy  of  the  firm.  Much  of  the  external \nknowledge apart from patented information remains informal in nature but does act like \nan invisible hand.  \n\nTable 5: Non-R&D Innovation Activities by Small and Medium Innovative Firms \n\nFirm Size \nSmall firms \nMedium firms \n\nAcquisition of \nTechnology \n(%) \n67 \n69 \n\nAcquisition of Other \nExternal Knowledge \n(%) \n16 \n18 \n\nMarket Introduction \nof Innovation \n(%) \n16 \n19 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on Indian National Innovation Survey, 2014. Figures are indicative. \n\nNontechnological  innovations  can  also  be  looked  at  from  the  perspective  of \norganizational  and  marketing  innovation.1 Medium-sized  firms  again  performed  better \nin  terms  of  pursuing  both  these  types  of  innovation,  which  is  most  likely  due  to  their \nbetter management expertise and ability to hire quality talent (Table 6). \n\nTable 6: Nontechnological Innovation by Small and Medium Innovative Firms \n\nFirm Size \nSmall firms \nMedium firms \n\nOrganizational Innovation  \n(%) \n41 \n52 \n\nMarketing Innovation  \n(%) \n45 \n57 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on Indian National Innovation Survey, 2014. Figures are indicative. \n\nTo understand the functioning of an innovation system completely, it is very important \nto  ascertain  the  sources  of  the  innovation.  The  source  of  a  product  or  process \ninnovation  can  be  internal,  external,  or  a  hybrid,  which  typically  includes  collaboration \nwith  other  firms,  institutions,  universities,  and  laboratories.  The  majority  (~80%  and \nabove)  of  the  innovative  small  and  medium  firms  use  internal  sources  to  develop  the \ninnovation (Table 7).  \n\nNearly one-third of the innovative small and medium firms use external sources and a \nvery small proportion use collaboration with other enterprises and institutions to source \ninnovations.  It  can  be  inferred  that  Indian  SMEs  mainly  use  indigenous  methods  to \ndevelop innovations and are relatively much less dependent on external sources. The \nminiscule  use  of  collaboration  with  other  institutions  points  to  very  low  integration  of \npublic  innovation  systems  and  SMEs,  and  this  remains  an  area  of  concern.  It  is  a \nwidely  established  fact  that  collaboration  with  other  enterprises  and  institutions  does \n\n                                                \n1   Organizational innovation: A new method related to the firm\u2019s ongoing business activities which covers \nimplementation  of  new  or  significantly  improved  management  systems  and  change  in  the  firm\u2019s \noperating structure including integration of different department and business activities. It also includes \nnew or substantial changes in the firm\u2019s relationships with other firms and institutions through alliances, \npartnerships, or any other commercial agreement.  \nMarketing  innovation:  Business  activities  and  initiatives  taken  by  the  firm  to  enter  new  markets.  It \nincludes new or significant improvement in designs, extension of the marketing function, and targeting \nor creating a new market altogether.  \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\ngreatly  help  SMEs  in  coming  up  with  new  innovations,  but  this  resource  remains \nunderutilized in India.  \n\nTable 7: Sourcing of Innovation and Technology by Innovative Firms \n\n \n\nSmall Firms  \n(%) \n\nMedium Firms \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource of Innovation \nInternal  \nExternal \nHybrid (with other enterprises, and with institutions \nsuch as universities and government labs) \nAcquisition of Technology \nDomestic market \nAcquired from collaborator  \nForeign market  \n\n79 \n36 \n\n2 \n \n14 \n5 \n4 \n\n84 \n39 \n\n1 \n \n11 \n5 \n6 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on Indian National Innovation Survey, 2014. Figures are indicative. \n\nSmaller  firms  tend  to  use  more  domestic  sources  to  acquire  technology  than  do \nmedium-sized  firms.  Only  4%\u20136%  of  the  innovative  small  and  medium-sized  firms \nsource their technology from either a collaborator or a foreign market. This shows that \nSMEs  in  India  do  not  have  sufficient  access  to  the  foreign  market  and  collaborators  \nto  acquire  technology.  It  also  suggests  that  Indian  SMEs\u2019  exposure  to  global \ntechnological advancements and innovation systems remains very limited, unlike in the \ncase  of  developed  economies.  The  main  limiting  factors  for  Indian  SMEs  to  acquire \nglobal  technologies  seem  to  be  financial  and  human  capacity  constraints  and  lack  \nof information.  \n\nIt is also interesting to see the sources that SMEs use or could use for getting advice, \nideas,  and  general  guidance  to  pursue  different  innovations.  Medium-sized  firms \nperform  marginally  better  than  smaller  firms  in  making  use  of  different  information \nsources  used  in  the  innovation  process.  Sources  of  information  for  SMEs  can  be \ninternal,  external,  market,  and  institutional,  among  others.  Internal,  external,  and \nmarket  sources  emerge  as  the  top  information  sources  for  innovative  SMEs  in  India \n(Figure  5).  Market  sources  include  suppliers,  customer  feedback,  other  enterprises, \nconsultants, and private labs and R&D institutes.  \n\nThe  other  sources,  such  as  conferences  and  trade  fairs,  journals  and  technical \npublications, and industry and professional associations, are used by ~30% or more of \ninnovative  small  and  medium  firms.  However,  the  institutional  sources  such  as \nuniversities,  colleges,  and  government  and  public  research  institutions  are  not \nfrequently  referred  to  as  sources  of  information,  reaffirming  the  weak  linkage  \nbetween  Indian  SMEs  and  the  overarching  institutional  architecture  of  innovation \nsupport systems.  \n\nFinancing for innovation remains a critical challenge for SMEs, especially in developing \neconomies  such  as  India.  It  can  be  inferred  from  Table  4  that  due  to  financial \nconstraints,  SMEs  do  not  pursue  sophisticated  R&D  innovations  and  remain  focused \non  non-R&D  and  incremental  innovations.  Funds  for  innovation  typically  come  from \nthree  sources:  internal  (the  firm\u2019s  own  financial  resources),  government,  and  foreign \nsources.  More  than  86%  of  the  innovative  small  and  medium-sized  firms  use  internal \nfinancial resources to pursue innovation (Figure 6). \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nFigure 5: Information Sources for Innovative SMEs \n\nThe image cannot be displayed.

Figures are indicative.  \n\nFigure 6: Financing of Innovation by Source \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on Indian National Innovation Survey, 2014. Figures are indicative. \n\nOnly  about  13%  of  innovative  small  and  medium  firms  use  government  funding  for \ninnovation.  Government  funding  can  come  in  the  form  of  tax  rebates,  grants,  and \nsubsidized  loans.  The  use  of  funds  from  foreign  sources  is  miniscule,  which  once  \nagain  reflects  the  weak  linkages  of  Indian  SMEs  with  the  outside  world.  The  funding \nchallenges  faced  by  SMEs  remain  unique,  and  large  firms  are  better  positioned  to \nexploit the financial opportunities arising from government funding and foreign sources.  \n\n4.  BARRIERS TO INNOVATION IN INDIAN SMES \n\nTo  improve  the  innovation  performance  of  SMEs,  it  is  very  important  to  understand  \nthe key barriers in the innovation ecosystem. The barriers to innovation are classified in \nsix  categories:  people,  financial,  information,  government  policy,  infrastructure,  and \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nmarket constraints. The Indian National Innovation Survey captures the response of the \ninnovative firms for different barriers and sub-barriers. The responses show the factors \nthat  firms  typically  consider  to  be  barriers  to  pursuing  innovation.  The  barriers  are \nanalyzed in the context of innovative small and medium firms; non-innovative firms as \nclassified in the survey are not included.  \n\nPeople and Skills as a Barrier to Innovation \n\nDevelopment  and  implementation  of  any  innovation  demands  skilled  labor.  The  need \nfor  specialized  skills  in  the  form  of  scientists,  technicians,  or  engineers  is  more \napparent in the case of R&D innovations. Non-R&D innovations, such as organizational \nand marketing innovations, also require specialized skills and staff who are well versed \nin  management  and  marketing  practices.  More  than  85%  of  innovative  small  and \nmedium firms see unavailability of skilled workers as a barrier to innovation, making it \none of the foremost challenges in SME innovation (Appendix 1).  \n\nSMEs  are  generally  unable  to  recruit  a  highly  skilled  workforce  due  to  financial \nconstraints  and  lack  of  adequate  infrastructure.  This  includes  internal  management. \nThe  lack  of  the  right  internal  management  can  adversely  impact  both  the  firm\u2019s \ninnovation  capability  and  its  overall  performance  due  to  lack  of  direction,  rising \ninefficiencies,  and  absence  of  market  focus,  among  others.  More  than  38%  of \ninnovative  small  and  medium  firms  perceive  internal  management  as  a  barrier  \nto innovation. \n\nThe  situation  demands  more  targeted  capacity  building  programs  focused  on  a \ncompany\u2019s internal management and its relevance to innovation. There also seems to \nbe  a  need  for  a  system  where  SMEs  have  access  to  a  pool  of  skilled  people  for \nconducting specialized work while addressing concerns about trade secrets. \n\nFinance as a Barrier to Innovation \n\nThe  financial  barriers  mainly  involve  the  availability  of  internal  and  external  finance  \nand  the cost  of  innovation.  More  than  87%  of innovative  small  and medium firms  see \nlimited availability of finance from both within the enterprise and external sources as a \nbarrier to innovation. The cost of innovation is a key barrier for more than 75% of the \ninnovative  small  and  medium  firms  (Appendix  1).  This  clearly  shows  that  financial \nconstraints remain one of the biggest barriers to SME innovation.  \n\nSMEs  in  India  face  a  multifold  and  vicious  circle  of  financial  challenges  in  pursuing \ninnovation.  Firstly,  the  cost  of  innovation  itself  is  high;  secondly,  SMEs  lack  the \nfinancial resources to implement innovation; and lastly, access to finance from external \nfinancial institutions seems to be limited, creating further bottlenecks. Therefore, there \nis  an  urgent  need  to  address  this  formidable  challenge  by  bringing  down  the  cost  of \ninnovation and increasing the availability of innovation capital through banks and other \nsupport mechanisms.  \n\nInformation as a Barrier to Innovation \n\nTimely  access to  valuable  information  is  critical for  SMEs  to  gain strategic  advantage  \nin  pursuing  innovation.  The  inability  to  access  key  market  information  can  seriously \nimpair a firm\u2019s performance. The information barriers refer to access to information on \ntechnology and markets. More than 75% of the innovative small firms and 86% of the \nmedium  firms  face  barriers  pertaining  to  technology  information  and  information  on \nmarkets in India (Appendix 1).  \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nThis  points  toward  another  serious  challenge,  the  need  to  upgrade  Indian  SMEs\u2019 \naccess  to  information  about  markets  and  technology.  The  inability  to  access  such \ninformation  not  only  affects  SMEs\u2019  global  competitiveness  and  exports  but  also  limits \ntheir  domestic  market  share.  There  is  a  need  for  the  government  to  take  adequate \nsteps, maybe in partnership with local industry associations, to disseminate key market \nand technology information while focusing on strengthening SME\u2013market linkages.  \n\nGovernment as a Barrier to Innovation \n\nGovernment  policy  and  the  government  in  itself  exert  a  strong  influence  on  the \ninnovation capacity of SMEs. The government has a critical role to play in every sphere \nof innovation including access to finance and technology, capacity building and human \nresources,  market  linkages,  availability  of  research  facilities,  and  access  to  key \ninformation, among others, via different policies and schemes. It would not be wrong to \nsay  that  the  government  is  the  single  biggest  factor  governing  the  innovation \necosystem of SMEs, especially in the case of developing economies such as India.  \n\nNearly 68% of the innovative small firms and ~75% of the innovative medium firms see \ngovernment  policy  and  meeting  government  regulatory  requirements  as  a  barrier  to \ninnovation in India (Appendix 1). The perception of the government as a barrier, rather \nthan a facilitator, for such a large number of innovative SMEs is a very serious issue. \nThe Indian innovation survey does not give any detail about the exact responses and \nreasons for this perception.  \n\nIndia is still ranked 130th globally in the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business index for \n2015,  which  reflects  the  burdensome  regulatory  environment  in  which  SMEs  operate. \nThe high costs involved in meeting a large number of regulatory requirements tend to \nnegatively  affect the  innovation  capacity  of  the firms. The role  of the government  and \nthe likely impact of its MSME policies on SMEs\u2019 innovation is discussed in detail in the \nforthcoming sections. \n\nInfrastructure as a Barrier to Innovation \n\nAvailability  and  access  to  infrastructure  is  crucial  for  R&D-based  innovations.  The \nability  of  a  firm  to  use  laboratories  and  research  facilities  inside  and/or  outside  the \npremises  exerts  a  significant  influence  on  its  capability  to  develop  R&D  innovations. \nClose  to  ~50%  and  ~60%  of  the  innovative  small  and  medium  firms,  respectively,  do \nnot have access to adequate infrastructure and test labs (Appendix 1) and see it as a \nbarrier to innovation. The limited availability of shared testing laboratories and research \nfacilities is also seen as a barrier to innovation by more than ~35% of innovative small \nand medium firms.  \n\nThis  points  toward  the  acute  shortage  of  research  infrastructure,  including  testing \nlaboratories, for SMEs in India. It is unlikely that SMEs  would have sufficient financial \nmuscle  to  invest  in  the  development  of  quality  in-house  research  and  testing \nlaboratories.  Therefore,  it  is  imperative  for  government  and  industry  to  facilitate  the \ndevelopment  of  more  shared  research  and  testing  laboratories,  especially  in  key \nmanufacturing clusters. \n\nMarket Factors as a Barrier to Innovation  \n\nMarket factors have an important role to play in innovation. Market characteristics such \nas  competition,  protectionist  nature,  dominance  and  monopoly,  and  demand,  among \nothers,  affect  a  firm\u2019s  ability  to  innovate,  especially  product-  and  market-related \ninnovations.  Of  the  innovative  small  and  medium  firms,  50%\u201358%  see  protectionist \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nmeasures for introducing new products and processes and lack of new opportunities to \nenter niche markets as barriers to innovation (Appendix 1).  \n\nMore  than  half  of  the  innovative  small  and  medium  firms  also  face  the  barrier  of \nuncertain  demand for  innovative  products  and  services.  Given  the  uncertain  demand, \nSMEs  would  be  reluctant  to  invest  their  resources  in  developing  new  products  and \nwould  focus  instead  on  improving  their  production  and  quality  processes.  Innovative \nproducts  generally  are  aimed  at  a  niche  market  that  is  often  not  clearly  visible  or \npresent, and hence tackling these market-related challenges becomes very important. \nThis also greatly hampers product and design innovation, which at times plays a critical \nrole in elevating the exports and global market share of the SMEs. \n\nThe  uncertainty  in  demand  again  points  toward  the  weak  market  linkages  and  thin \nintegration  of  Indian  SMEs  in  the  global  value  chain.  The  protectionist  nature  of  the \nmarket, due to either a monopolistic nature or intellectual property rights (IPR) issues, \npresents a tough challenge for SMEs. IPR in general remains an area of concern and \ndevelopment  among  Indian  SMEs.  There  is  a  need  to  focus  on  capacity  building \nprograms  to  train  SMEs  to  identify  market  potential  and  devise  an  appropriate  entry \nstrategy while addressing the IPR issues.  \n\n5.  INSTITUTIONAL ACCESS AND SME INNOVATION IN \n\nINDIA \n\nInnovation does not occur in silos. It happens with close interaction between a firm that \nwants  to  pursue  innovation  and  the  support  systems  that  assist  the  firm  in  securing \ntechnology, skilled staff, and knowledge and market opportunity. The whole innovation \nprocess works like an ecosystem involving firms and support mechanisms provided by \ngovernment, foreign players, and other entities.  \n\nThe  strength  of the  innovation  ecosystem  often  reflects  the  innovation  capacity  of  the \nfirms. Good institutional support is a critical part of the wider ecosystem for supporting \nSME  innovation.  However,  it  is  important  to  understand  that  just  offering  institutional \nsupport alone will not foster innovation. It is equally crucial to ensure that the operating \nfirms  are  aware  of  different  institutional  support  mechanisms  and  are  able  to  access \nthem.  \u201cInstitutional  support\u201d  is  primarily  referring  to  the  entities  that  are  engaged  \nin  extending  assistance  to  SMEs,  such  as  government  bodies,  universities,  R&D \ninstitutions, and banks. The role of institutional linkages is very relevant to India.  \n\nThe  Indian  National  Innovation  Survey  showcases  the  use  of  institutional  support \namong  innovative  firms  operating  in  different  states  and  union  territories.  The  data \nshow  a  wide  disconnect  between  the  innovative  firms  and  institutional  support. \n\u201cInnovative  firms\u201d  here  refers  to  all  innovative  firms  covered  in  the  Indian  National \nInnovation  Survey  irrespective  of  their  size.  Educational  institutions  as  an  institutional \nsource  of  knowledge  are  used  by  an  average  of  31%  of  innovative  firms  across \ndifferent  states  and  union  territories  in  India.  In  about  20  of  the  30  states  and  union \nterritories,  less  than  30%  of  innovative  firms  access  educational  institutes  as  a \nknowledge  source  (Appendix  2).  The  situation  is  a  bit  better  in  the  use  of  R&D \ninstitutions.  Around  40%  of  innovative  firms  on  average  use  R&D  institutions  as  a \nknowledge  source  across  different  states  and  union  territories  covered  in  the  survey. \nThere  is  a  huge  opportunity  to  increase  firms\u2019  innovation  capacity  by  promoting  and \nincreasing  the  use  of  institutional  sources  for  gathering  required  information  and \nknowledge on both technological and nontechnological aspects of innovation.  \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nThe situation is more challenging in terms of accessing institutional sources of finance \nand  training  by  SMEs  in  India.  Less  than  20%  of  innovative  firms  access  institutional \nsources of finance in India, except in the state of Madhya Pradesh. This reaffirms the \nformidable  challenge  of  innovation  financing  for  SMEs  in  India.  Access  to  institutional \nsources  for  training  is  also  in  the  same  deplorable  state,  with  less  than  20%  of \ninnovative  firms  using  it  across  all  states  and  union  territories  covered  in  the  survey \n(Appendix 2). On average, less than 7% of innovative firms access institutional sources \nfor both finance and training across different states and union territories in India.  \n\nIt is important to note that these percentages only reflect the use of institutional sources \nby innovative firms, which make up just one-third of the total firms. The state of affairs \nlooks even more dire if viewed from the perspective of total firms. Clearly, there seems \nto be an urgent need to improve SMEs\u2019 access to institutional sources for their different \nneeds. This can be done by both promoting existing institutions and opening new ones \nsupporting  SME  innovation.  The  government  policy  needs  to  be  cognizant  of  the \ncurrent situation and frame the institutional support mechanisms accordingly. \n\n6.  SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND INNOVATION IN THE \n\nINDIAN CONTEXT \n\nThe use of the word \u201cinnovation\u201d in the national science and technology policy lexicon \nis  rather  new.  India\u2019s  Scientific  Policy  Resolution  1958  sought  the  \u201ccultivation  \nof  science  and  scientific  research  in  all  its  aspects.\u201d  The  focus  was  on  \u201cearly  and  \nlarge  scale  development  of  science  and  technology\u201d  for  the  wealth  and  prosperity  of \nthe nation.  \n\nThe  1983  Technology  Policy  Statement  focused  on  the  need  for  technology \ncompetence  and  self-reliance. \ntechnology  acquisition  and  \ntransfers,  as  well  as  a  critical  facet  that  was  hitherto  missing  from  policy  debate  in \nIndia\u2014implementation.  \n\nIt  also  mentioned \n\nThe idea of innovation was inserted in the Science and Technology Policy 2003 with a \nview  to  strengthening  the  national  R&D  infrastructure  and  creating  a  \u201cnational \ninnovation  system.\u201d  Innovation  implies  science-  and  technology-based  solutions  that \nare successfully deployed in the economy or the society. Also mentioned was the need \nto  develop  and  leverage  India\u2019s  traditional  knowledge,  as  well  as  to  generate  and \nmanage  India\u2019s  intellectual  property  resources.  Monitoring  for  speedy  implementation \nof the policy was also given weightage.  \n\nThe most recent Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy 2013 in India is the \nmost  comprehensive  policy  statement  from  the  point  of  view  of  India\u2019s  STI  policy \nframework. It mentions  the  deepening  of the  science  and  technology  system  in  India, \nand  recognizes  that  the  \u201cinstrument  of  policy\u201d  has  not  given  due  importance  to \ninnovation.  India  accordingly  declared  2010\u20132020  as  the  \u201cdecade  of  innovation\u201d  and \ntook the important step of establishing the National Innovation Council. It also alludes \nto  the  need  to  understand  that  science,  technology,  and  innovation  are  not \ndisconnected  from  each  other\u2014they  need  to  be  integrated  for  new  value  creation.  In \naddition, the policy focuses on creating an innovation ecosystem that is inclusive, and it \npromotes mechanisms like \u201csmall idea\u2013small money\u201d and \u201crisky idea funds\u201d to support \nincubators.  The  policy  also  talks  about  \u201cSTI  driven  entrepreneurship\u201d  with  viable  and \nscalable  business  models.  Another  important  point  is  the  policy\u2019s  focus  on  promoting \nacademic  and  industry  linkages.  In  terms  of  the  manufacturing  sector,  it  emphasizes \nhigh-tech exports while recognizing the low R&D intensity among SMEs. \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nSeveral  positive  changes  that  were  envisaged  in  the  STI  Policy  2013  have  been \nrealized.  These  include  an  increase  in  India\u2019s  gross  expenditure  in  research  and \ndevelopment from under 1% of GDP in 2013 to 2% of GDP, which had been a national \ngoal  for  some  time  before  the  policy  was  in  place. 2 For  this  to  happen,  the  policy \nexpects private sector R&D investment to at least match public sector R&D investment, \ncompared with a ratio of around 1:3 in 2013. India\u2019s considerable progress is reflected \nin global rankings; it ranks 9th in the number of scientific publications and 12th in the \nnumber  of  patents  filed.  While  these  show  considerable  maturity  of  the  science  and \ntechnology  ecosystem,  the  fact  remains  that  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology \nunderstands  the  technology  landscape  in  quite  broad  terms.  The  major  policy \nresolutions and their impact on small-scale industries are provided in Appendix 3. \n\n7.  PRESENT MSME AND SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, \n\nAND INNOVATION SYSTEMS  \n\nPresent STI System \n\nAt  present  the  science  and  technology  ecosystem  in  India  is  defined  in  quite  broad \nterms.  The  science  and  technology  system  in  India  comprises  the  broad  institutions \nshown in Figure 7.  \n\nFigure 7: Present Science and Technology System in India \n\nNGO = nongovernment organization, R&D = research and development, S&T = science and technology. \n\nSource: Government of India, Department of Science and Technology. S&T System in India. www.dst.gov.in/st-system-\nindia  \n\n \n\n                                                \n2   The policy does not indicate specifically the year in which the 2% target is to be achieved, but it implies \n\nthat it should be reached by 2018. \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nAmong  these  central  departments,  the  Department  of  Science  and  Technology  has  \nthe  primary  task  of  formulating  science  and  technology  policy  and  promoting  thrust \nareas  for  research.  It  is  also  entrusted  with  science  and  society  programs  as  well  as \nwith  international  collaborations.  The  Council  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  \nwith  its  40  institutions  and  laboratories  is  the  major  organization  coming  under  the \nDepartment  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research.  The  council\u2019s  major  aim  is  to \nstrengthen  and  support  R&D  through  industrial  programs  and  other  activities.  Apart \nfrom  these,  the  research  infrastructure  for  scientific  research  is  present  in  a  large \nnumber of universities.  \n\nUnder  the  Department  of  Science  and  Technology  in  FY2014,  the  Technology \nInformation, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) did some work pertaining to \nbringing innovations from lab to market. TIFAC has also done MSME cluster mapping \nand  completed  22  technology  gap  analyses  so  far.  The  Department  of  Scientific  \nand  Industrial  Research  also  launched  a  new  program,  Promoting  Innovations  in \nIndividuals, Start-ups and MSMEs (PRISM), during India\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan and \nthe department supported 17 projects in FY2014. \n\nFigure 8: Central Government Science and Technology Departments \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPresent MSME System \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nThe  Government  of  India  looks  at  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  under  \nthe  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  Development  Act  2006,  which  seeks  to \ndevelop and enhance the competitiveness of MSMEs as a whole. In the act, for the first \ntime  the  concept  of  \u201centerprise\u201d  included  both  manufacturing  and  services  firms.  Also \ndescribed  in  the  act  for  the  first  time  is  the  concept  of  \u201cmedium\u201d  enterprises.  The \nMSME  ecosystem  is  administered  through  the  Ministry  of  Micro,  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprises, which has, broadly speaking, two major divisions. These include the Small \nand  Medium  Enterprises  division  and  the  Agro  and  Rural  Industries  division.  A \ndescription of the present MSME system is given in Figure 9.  \n\nFigure 9: Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises \n\nThe image cannot be displayed.

REASONS FOR PERCEPTION OF GOVERNMENT \n\nPOLICY AS A BARRIER \n\nDespite  this  overarching  framework  for  MSMEs  and  STI,  several  problems  are  seen \nwithin the government policy context:  \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nAccording  to  the  Fourth  All  India  Census  of  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises, 3 \nroughly  96%  of  MSMEs  are  unregistered,  which  results  in  their  exclusion  from  most \nprograms and schemes of the government. Most MSMEs are unregistered because of \nlong  delays  in  the  registration  process.  This  may  partially  explain  why  MSMEs  view \ngovernment  policy  as  a  barrier  rather  than  an  enabler. The  government  is  working \ntoward easing this and has created a simplified procedure for registering an MSME unit \nonline through the Udyog Adhaar Scheme. \n\nSecond,  within  the  central  government\u2019s  policy  on  STI,  the  thrust  of  the  institutions  is \nstill very much on high-end technical and technological research, which may be of use \nto  multinational  and  public  sector  enterprises  but  does  not  find  consonance  with  the \ndemands  of  the  MSME  sector,  especially  the  unorganized  sector.  Though  both  the \nCouncil  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  and  the  Indian  Institute  of  Science  have \nworked with MSMEs, the scale of operations is far less than what is required. The case \nis similar with technology business incubators. A few have been operational but there is \nmuch more potential to be harnessed in terms of industry interactions and improvement \nof functioning as well as establishing new technology business incubators.  \n\nThird,  within  the  government  policy  pillar  is  the  low  collaboration  within  as  well  as \namong  government  departments,  universities,  and  MSME  entities.  Within \nthe \ngovernment  departments,  the  goals  of  the  research  institutions  and  the  unorganized \nMSME  sector  often  do  not  match.  The  national  labs  often  end  up  producing  patents \nand  high-end  technical  inventions  that  the  unorganized  MSME  sector  is  simply \nincapable of buying or sourcing. At present too much focus is put on R&D. The majority \nof  the  innovations  in  SMEs  are  non-R&D  innovations,  which  institutions  often  ignore. \nAnd even when MSMEs have the buying capability, usability can be an issue.  \n\nFourth,  another  major  point  hindering  innovation  is  that  within  the  government  policy \nframework, some  of the previous  institutions  are simply  defunct,  which  in  turn causes \nthe  policy  and  implementation  to  flounder.  Two  examples  that  come  to  mind  from  a \npolicy  viewpoint  are  the  National  Innovation  Council  and  the  National  Manufacturing \nCompetitiveness Council. Both of these institutions have seen resignations and no new \nappointments have been made since the new government was elected. The functioning \nof  these  institutions  is  important  for  innovation  to  take  root  in  the  MSME  policy.  The \nchallenge of innovation within MSMEs is also with respect to continuity in government \npolicy.  These  institutions  must  see  new  appointments  and  new  members  to  carry  out \ntheir  crucial  role  on  the  innovation  and  policy  front. There  is  also  a  need  for  greater \ngovernment  transparency  and  accountability  for  addressing  the  sector\u2019s  issues \npertaining to innovation.  \n\nFifth, access to financing is again to an extent determined by the government policy. A \nrecently  established  institution  for  solving  the  problem  in  the  MSME  space  is  the \nMUDRA  Bank,  but  it  is  too  early  to  talk  about  the  relative  merits  and  demerits  of  its \nfunctioning.  In  the  case  of  access  to  finance,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  issues \nguidelines to the banking sector for lending to priority sectors. MSME is a priority sector \nprecisely because it is employment intensive. The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s directive to \nthe banking sector includes implementing the recommendations of the Prime Minister's \ntask force on the MSME sector submitted in 2010. It mentioned the need for the banks \nto  achieve  20%  year-on-year  growth  in  credit  to  micro  and  small  enterprises,  10% \nannual growth in the number of microenterprise accounts, and 60% total lending to the \nMSE  sector  to  be  channeled  to  microenterprises.  The  public  sector  banks  have  also \nbeen advised to open specialized branches for MSMEs. As of March 2014, there were \n\n                                                \n3   The  census  took  FY2006  as  the  base  or  reference  year.  The  data  was  collected  until  2009  and  the \n\nresults were published in 2012. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\n2,887  specialized  branches  for  MSMEs.  Also,  collateral-free  loans  are  mandated  for \nMSMEs  up  to  a  limit  of  Rs1  million.  Cluster  financing  is  also  available.  The  problem \nthus  does  not  seem  to  pertain  to  policy  in  this  regard  but  to  its  implementation.  If \nMSMEs  find  it  difficult  to  avail  themselves  of  loans,  it  is  due  to  either  a  lack  of \nawareness  among  MSMEs  or  the  fact  that  banks  find  loopholes  in  these  directives. \nAnother  major  point  within \ntechnology \ndevelopment and access to finance is that seed and angel funding is still not as mature \nas  later  stages  of  venture  capital  and  private  equity  in  India,  which  inhibits  growth  of \nstart-ups. \n\nthe  MSME  ecosystem \n\nfor  promoting \n\nSixth,  as  noted  in  the  National  Innovation  Survey  Report  (CSIR  2014),  another  major \nchallenge on the government policy front is that MSMEs\u2019 access to institutional facilities \nthat  support  innovation,  like  institutional  finance  and  institutional  training  programs,  is \ngenerally  very  low,  indicating  a  disconnect  between  the  innovation  infrastructure  and \nthe production system. \n\nSeventh,  another  major  challenge  within  the  government  policy  pillar  pertains  to  the \nregulatory architecture and the transaction costs for MSMEs. According to the list given \nin  the  Ministry  of  Labour  and  Employment\u2019s  annual  report  for  2014\u20132015,  there  are \npresently  44  central  laws  pertaining  to  labor  regulation  in  India.  In  addition,  there  are \nsome 160 state-level enactments containing supplementary provisions (Papola 2013). \nMost times it makes the functioning too problematic and the transaction costs are very \nhigh. This leads to a perception of government as an inhibitor rather than a supporter. \nFor example, the laws pertaining to the factory sector (defined in India as a firm having \nmore  than  10  workers)  often  require  considerable  legal  documentation  and  process. \nThat  is  how  the  government  policy  causes  MSMEs  to  remain  small  and  outside  the \nregistration ambit. It also acts as a hindrance to the growth of innovation in MSMEs as \neconomies of scale bring addition resources for innovation.  \n\n9.  ENABLERS OF SME INNOVATION \n\nInnovation  has  many  enablers  that  are  related  to  both  internal  and  external \nenvironments.  The  internal  environment  covers  the  company\u2019s  operations,  market \nstrategy  and  vision,  skills,  creativity,  and  quest  for  innovation,  among  others.  The \nexternal  environment \nfactors,  policy  environment,  support \nmechanisms, availability of skilled labor, etc. The intensity of the effect of internal and \nexternal environmental factors on innovation is likely to vary depending on the stage of \neconomic  development  of  the  country,  industry  maturity  and  sophistication,  and \ndirection of government policy. \n\nincludes \n\nindustry \n\nThe  data  from  the  India  Innovation  Survey  suggest  that  the  internal  environment  \nof  SMEs  is  the  key  enabler  of  innovation.  The  majority  of  the  innovative  SMEs  use \ninternal sources for pursuing innovation. The acquisition of new machines as the most \ndominant  form  of  innovation  can  be  seen  as  a  result  of  SMEs\u2019  internal  push  and \nmotivation to improve productivity. Among non-R&D innovations, the significant use of \norganizational  and  marketing  innovation  showcases  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  among \nIndian SMEs. To add to that, internal financing remains the major source of innovation \nfinancing among SMEs in India.  \n\nThese  facts  and  observations  infer  that  the  intrinsic  zeal  to  innovate  and  remain \ncompetitive  in  the  market  plays  a  major  role  in  innovation  for  India\u2019s  SMEs.  The  role  \nof  internal factors  becomes  even  more crucial  in  a  scenario  where government  policy  \nin  itself  is  seen  as  a  major  barrier  to  SME  innovation,  as  it  is  in  India.  This  also \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nsuggests that innovation may always persist in some form or other independent of the \nexternal environment.  \n\nOn  the  external  front  several  challenges  are  observed.  These  include  access  to \nrequisite  information,  policy  gaps  between  requirements  and  what  is  offered,  and  \nthe  magnitude  of  the  challenge  from  the  government\u2019s  viewpoint.  Enablers  on  the \ngovernment policy front include designing systems and schemes that enable upgrading \nof the existing firms or cluster of firms and helping them compete in the domestic and \ninternational economy. These schemes have to be routed through institutions that have \nthe  scale to  enable  proper  institutional support to  MSMEs.  Platforms  like  the  National \nInnovation  Foundation,  which  seeks  to  map  innovations  and  work  with  innovators  to \nhelp them scale up their innovation, thus is a good model for addressing this anomaly \nby bringing together the investor and the innovator on the same platform. \n\n10.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE REMOVAL OF \n\nBARRIERS TO INNOVATION  \n\nThe  creation  of  an  action  plan  for  SMEs  is  required  to  achieve  broad  innovation \nobjectives. Detailing the contours of overall MSME innovation policy is critical. Several \nbarriers  and  the  policy  context  act  as  reasons  for  the  perception  of  government  as  a \nbarrier to innovation. Below are several recommendations for embedding innovation in \nthe country\u2019s SME ecosystem, clustered under five broad categories.  \n\nPeople and Skills \n\n\u2022  Change  the  laws  and  regulations  that  cause  negative  impacts  for  the  overall \ngrowth  of  the  MSME  sector  and  its  innovation,  such  as  specific  labor \nregulations pertaining to factories.  \n\n\u2022  Promote capacity development programs and vocational education and training \n\nthat have innovation as part of their curriculum. \n\n\u2022  Utilize the architecture of SMEs presently in place to train people on innovation \n\nand how to avail themselves of the benefits of innovation schemes.  \n\n\u2022  Because  management  skills  are  largely  missing,  establish  a  dedicated  SME \nuniversity  for  skill  development,  which  has  courses  for  education  on  issues \npertaining to innovation in SMEs. \n\nFinance  \n\n\u2022  Ensure  credit  flow  is  maintained  through  government  schemes  and  market \nmechanisms  through  the  banking  channels  in  the  country.  The  schemes  need \nto expand to meet the demand of the sector. \n\n\u2022  Ensure  adequate  support  mechanisms  exist  for  entrepreneurs  who  are  \nwilling  to  establish  small  enterprises.  The  Start-up  India  plan  is  a  step  in  the \nright direction.  \n\n\u2022  Create an innovation fund under the Ministry of MSME, which can help provide \n\nfinancing to SMEs, especially for supporting innovation.  \n\n\u2022  The  recently  started  MUDRA  (Micro  Units  Development  &  Refinance  Agency) \n\nshould have a dedicated fund for innovation in SMEs. \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\n\u2022  The  definition  of  innovation  has  to  be  clearly  defined  and  low-interest  loans \nshould be provided by the banks for innovation activities. The Reserve Bank of \nIndia can issue guidelines in this regard.  \n\nSupport for Marketing Activity \n\n\u2022  Set up industry associations and tie up the marketing side of SME clusters with \n\ngovernment to create value across the value chain. \n\n\u2022  Utilize  existing  centers  for  providing  access  to  information  on  Indian  and \nexternal  markets  for  innovative  products  and  on  how  SMEs  can  benefit  from \nthis  information.  Reports  can  also  be  made  publicly  available  to  inform  people \nof the potential of a particular product market in India and abroad.  \n\n\u2022  Sponsor  dedicated  days  when  SME  owners  can  discuss  their  products  with \nexperts  and  consultants  who  can  help  them  better  understand  consumer \ndemand and emerging trends. \n\n\u2022  Move  toward  demand-driven  and  market-driven  models  of  SME  innovation \nrather than just R&D-focused innovation models. What is required for innovation \nis  not  just  R&D  but  a  gamut  of  activities,  such  as  finding  linkages  to  \nsuitable markets. \n\n\u2022  Promote  cluster  development  mechanisms  in  line  with  successful  cluster \ndevelopment  programs  elsewhere.  This  will  help  boost  the  marketing  side  \nof innovation.  \n\nGovernment Framework and Institutional Access  \n\n\u2022  Establish  a  center  of  excellence  for  innovation  in  the  Ministry  of  MSME  or  its \n\nattached offices to help promote a culture of innovation.  \n\n\u2022  Ensure that adequate numbers of policies are in place; the scale and benefits of \nthe  policies  may  be  reviewed  from  time  to  time  keeping  in  view  the \nrequirements of the sector.  \n\n\u2022  Reduce the information asymmetry between different government departments \nand  enable  collaboration  at  all  levels\u2014from  the  ministry  and  department  level \ndown to the institutional, cluster, and firm levels. This means more collaboration \nbetween government research departments, the private sector, people engaged \nin production processes, and entrepreneurs at the grassroots level.  \n\n\u2022  Set  up  more  institutions,  such  as  the  National  Institute  for  Micro,  Small  and \nMedium  Enterprises  and \nin \nAhmedabad, that can help in scaling up current programs for greater scope and \ndepth in helping individual firms and clusters. \n\nthe  Entrepreneurship  Development \n\nInstitute \n\nTechnological Development and National Innovation Architecture  \n\n\u2022  Look  at  institutions  and  programs  that  can  help  promote  science,  technology, \n\nand innovation in the existing context. \n\n\u2022  Cluster  development  programs:  Develop  R&D  centers  for  particular  clusters. \nThe government has already carried out a large number of cluster requirement \nstudies.  A  common  facility  or  center  can  support  R&D  as  well  as  capacity \nbuilding for members of the cluster. Clusters can also be virtually connected to \nother clusters and avail themselves of information on intellectual property rights.  \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\n\u2022  Take measures for upgrading of machines, funding of technology by banks, and \ntechnology  development  by  national  labs  and  align  innovation  requirements  of \nSMEs with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. \n\n11.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nDespite the numerous challenges, the SME sector in India has performed well. There \nare distinct barriers to innovation, the most important of which seems to be government \npolicy. This leads to the adage that \u201centrepreneurs grow not due to the government in \nIndia, but despite the government.\u201d However, a deeper analysis leads one to conclude \nthat  the  government  is  trying  to  facilitate  the  growth  of  SMEs  by  promoting  various \nschemes  and  programs  to  facilitate  innovation  in  the  sector  through  its  distinct \ninstitutions.  The  Science,  Technology  and  Innovation  Policy  2013  has  had  an  impact \nbut  the  institutional  functioning  of  the  government,  Council  of  Scientific  and  Industrial \nResearch  labs,  and  individual  firms  often  does  not  match.  The  scale  of  operations  in \nboth  the  public  labs  and  the  private  research  institutions  need  to  be  ramped  up  for \ngreater reach and support to SMEs. Another major finding is that some programs, like \nthe Cluster Development Program, can be expanded to provide greater access to more \nindividual firms within the cluster. Modernization and technology upgrading along with \ninnovative  methods  of  capacity  building  and  marketing  of  products  are  necessary.  A \nholistic and separate innovation policy for the SME sector can also be made to promote \ninnovation.  The  policy,  institutions,  and  supporting  framework  have  to  be  improved  \nto remove SMEs\u2019 perception that government is limiting their success. Over time, this \ncan  be  done  with  the  proactive  participation  of  experts  and  policy  makers  to  benefit \nIndia\u2019s SMEs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 588 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nPachouri and Sharma \n\nCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and National Institute  \n\nof Science, Technology and Development Studies. 2014.

These \nincluded factors like provision of raw materials, cheap power, technical \nadvice, organized marking of their products, and, if necessary, \nsafeguards against intensive competition by large-scale manufacturers, \nas well as worker education in the use of the best available technique. \nThe policy stressed the role that cottage, village, and small-scale \nindustries could play in the development of the national economy. Also \nmentioned were the advantages that SSIs offered like large-scale \nemployment, equitable distribution of resources, and restricting \nunplanned urbanization.  \nIncreased the items reserved for production by SSIs from 180 to 500 \nand called for establishment of district industries centers, which would \nassist in the development of household industries as distinct from SSIs. \nAlso stressed (i) development and application of appropriate policies in \nIndia, and (ii) development of indigenous technology as far as possible.  \nThe policy emphasized the need for creating ancillary units and \nredefined the investment limits for small-scale units. Also stressed the \nneed for better access to finance for small enterprises, continued the \nreservation under the 1977 resolution, and extended marketing support \nto SSIs.  \nThe period saw several changes in the way MSMEs function. These \ninclude coming to terms with the fact that SMEs have to remain \ncompetitive in the face of increasing competition. Technological \nprowess of SMEs started to increase due to the increasing competition. \nSome important legislation during the period focuses on removal of \nitems from the list of those reserved for production solely by SSIs, \namong others. The liberalization of industrial policy along with the \nliberalization of trade and opening of sectors paved the way for greater \nde-reservation of items previously reserved for SSI\u2019s. Several papers \nand committee reports suggested that a policy of de-reservation should \nbe followed.  \n\nSSI = small-scale industries. \n\nSource: Government of India, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.

Innovation  is  often  discussed  in  the  setting  of  developed  countries,  but  the  rise  of \nemerging  economies  such  as  India  has  generated  a  new  interest  in  understanding \ninnovation in developing economies. This paper aims to study and present the current state \nof innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in India. The focus of the paper \nis  to  bring  out  the  key  barriers  SMEs  face  in  the  innovation  process  in  the  context  of  the \nexisting  government  policy.  India,  being  a  developing  nation,  has  its  own  set  of  unique \nsituations and challenges that impede the innovation potential of SMEs operating in it. Many \nof these barriers are related to public policy, funding constraints, shortage of skilled research \nand  development  (R&D)  workforce,  and  weak  linkages  between  institutions  and  the  firms, \namong others.  \n", "The paper also discusses the existing government policy framework and enablers to support \nSMEs\u2019 innovation in India. It presents the key findings and recommendations in the form of \npolicy  suggestions  to  the  government  while  taking  into  account  the  key  challenges  and \nenablers highlighted in the study. \n", " \nJEL Classification: G20, G28, O38 \n \n", " \n"]}
