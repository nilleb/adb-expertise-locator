INTRODUCTION \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nAs  argued  by  Loayza  et  al.  (2000),  among  others,  criminal  activities  act  like  a  tax  on \nthe  entire  economy,  discouraging  domestic  and  foreign  direct  investment,  reducing \nfirms\u2019  competitiveness,  diverting  resources  to  nonproductive  use,  and  creating \nuncertainty  and  inefficiency.  Also,  individuals  who  have  contacts  with  the  criminal \njustice  system  face  less  chance  of  employment,  which  increases  the  cost  of  job \nmatching and unemployment (Borland and Hunter 1999). More generally, crimes impair \nquality  of  life  anywhere  and  everywhere,  adversely  affecting  happiness  and  health \n(Robinson and Keithley 2000; Davies and Hinks 2010). Some directly cause fear, pain, \nand suffering (Detotto and Otranto 2010). \n\nTo  contain  or  fight  crimes,  it  is  vital  to  identify  and  analyze  the  determinants.  One  of \nthem  is  income  distribution  (Backer  1968;  Merlo  2003).  As  pointed  out  by  Thurow \n(1971),  preventing  crime  and  creating  social  or  political  stability  may  depend  on \npreserving  a  narrow  distribution  of  income.  In  modeling  the  relationship  between \nincome distribution and crime, the conventional practice is to use inequality indicators \nsuch  as  the  Gini  coefficient  (Enamorado  et  al.  2016).  However,  inequality  indicators \nonly measure income differences. They do not capture clustering of individuals, which \nhas implications on social segregation or alienation. As criminologists point out, those \nwho  are  alienated  in  a  community  or  society  are  more  likely  to  commit  crimes \n(Patterson  1991).  Further,  in  a  segregated  society  or  when  a  population  group  is \nalienated,  upward  income  mobility  would  be  low  for  the  disadvantaged.  According  to \nFriedman  (1962),  two  societies  with  the  same  income  inequality,  the  one  with  greater \nincome mobility would be more equal in the long run.  \n\nThus,  it  appears  preferable  to  use  measures  of  income  distribution  that  can  capture \nsegregation and alienation of individuals when exploring the income distribution\u2013crime \nrelationship. Interestingly, the recently developed polarization indices can capture both \nthe  income  differences  and  social  segregation  (Foster  and  Wolfson  1992,  2010).  By \ndefinition, polarization describes the extent of population clustering with homogeneous \nindividuals within each cluster but heterogeneous individuals across clusters (Esteban \nand  Ray  1994).  In  a  polarizing  society,  population  clusters  become  more  and  more \nsharply distinguished from one another in wealth and power, resulting in immobility and \nlow social integration (Deutsch 1971). In particular, income polarization is found to be \nclosely related to social unrest (Esteban and Ray 1994). \n\nThis paper contributes to the literature by introducing polarization into crime modeling \nand  by  exploring  the  determinants  of  crime  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC), \nusing  the  index  of  Duclos,  Estaban,  and  Ray  (2004)  or  DER  index  hereafter. 1 We  \nfocus  on  the  post-reform  period  in  the  PRC  when  income  distribution  worsened  and  \ncrime  rates  rose  significantly. 2 It  is  found  that  income  polarization  is  positively  and \nsignificantly  associated  with  crimes  while  the  coefficients  of  inequality  indicators  are \nless  significant  or  insignificant.  When  the  DER  index  and  an  inequality  indicator  are \nboth  included  in  the  same  model,  the  coefficient  of  the  former  remains  positive  and \nsignificant while that of the latter becomes insignificant with unexpected signs. \n\n                                                \n1   Pioneer  studies on  this subject  are,  for example, Foster  and Wolfson  (1992, 2010),  Esteban  and  Ray \n\n(1994), Wang and Tsui (2000), Zhang and Kanbur (2001), and Duclos, Estaban, and Ray (2004). \n\n2   Official statistics show that criminals arrested by the People\u2019s Procuratorate increased from 598,101 in \n1998 to 896, 403 in 2013, nearly 1.5 times within 15 years (National Bureau of Statistics 1998, 2013). \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review, followed by \nmodel  specification  and  data  description  in  section  3.  Section  4  presents  empirical \nresults and sensitivity analyses. Section 5 concludes, with policy implications.  \n\n2.  CRIME, INCOME INEQUALITY, AND INCOME \n\nPOLARIZATION: LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nThe economic literature on crime can be traced back to Becker (1968), who establishes \nthat a rational decision of criminal acts is based on cost\u2013benefit analysis. The expected \nnet  benefit  is  the  difference  between  the  loot  and  the  opportunity  cost  of  crime  \nsuch  as  penalties  imposed  on  apprehended  criminals.  According  to  Ehrlich  (1973), \ninequality  induces  crimes  because  of  large  differences  between  the  expected  \ngains  from  successful  crime  and  returns  from  legitimate  work  for  the  poor.  This  link \nbetween inequality and crime was further examined in a general equilibrium model by \n\u0130mrohoro\u011flu, Merlo, and Rupert (2000), where the crime rate, the levels of expenditures \nfor  police  protection,  and  income  redistribution  are  simultaneously  determined.  They \nshow  that  increases  in  the  variance  of  wage  lead  to  higher  crime  rates.  Using  a \ndynamic equilibrium model, \u0130mrohoro\u011flu et al. (2004) find that when income inequality \nincreases in the United States (US), more people engage in criminal activities. \n\nTo empirically model the relationship between income distribution and crime, almost all \nstudies  employ  inequality  indicators  as  proxies  of  income  distribution.  And  research \nfindings  are  mixed.  For  instance,  Chiu  and  Madden  (1988)  examine  the  effects  of \nincome inequality on the level of burglary. They argue that individuals with low earnings \npotentially  have  a  greater  incentive  to  take  risks  and  engage  in  burglary.  The  rich \nbecome  potential  burglary  victims.  Their  empirical  results  show  that  the  number  of \nburglaries increases as inequality increases. Fowles and Merva (1996) find that wage \ninequality  is  positively  linked  to  violent  crimes.  Ehrlich  (1973)  and  Hsieh  and  Pugh \n(1993) argue that rising income inequality breads crime, as confirmed by Blau and Blau \n(1982)  and  Kelly  (2000)  using  data  on  violent  crime  from  the  US.  Fajnzylber  et  al. \n(2002)  find  a  two-way  causality  between  crime  and  income  inequality.  Using  an \ninstrument  variable  approach,  Enamorado  et  al.  (2016)  find  that  between  2006  and \n2010, a one percentage point rise in the Gini coefficient translates into an increase of \nmore  than  10  drug-related  homicides  per  100,000  inhabitants.  Using  data  from  the \nPRC, crime rate is also found to be positively correlated with intra-provincial inequality \n(Cheong and Wu 2015). \n\nContrary  to  the  above  findings,  other  studies  demonstrate  that  income  inequality  is \nnegatively correlated or uncorrelated with crimes. Using county-level data from the US, \nBrush (2007) finds a negative relationship between income inequality and crime rates \nin  the  time-series  setting  although  the  relationship  is  positive  in  the  cross-sectional \nsetting. The negative correlation is also found by Baharom and Habibullah (2009), who \nuse 1973\u20132003 data from Malaysia. Chintrakarn and Herzer (2012) employ state-level \npanel data for the period 1965\u20132005 in the US and find that inequality exerts a robust \ncrime-reducing  effect.  Finally,  Zhang  et  al.  (2011)  conclude  that  there  is  no  robust \nevidence  supporting  the  positive  relationship  between  income  inequality  and  crime  in \nthe PRC. \n\nThese mixed findings could be attributable to the incompleteness of income inequality \nas a proxy of income distribution. As argued earlier, inequality indicators only measure \nincome gaps and do not capture income immobility and social segregation, which are \nperceived  to  drive  crime.  On  the  other  hand,  income  polarization  reflects  a  \u201cdivided \nsociety\u201d  (Zhang  and  Kanbur  2001)  where  people  cannot  easily  change  their  social \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nidentity  from  one  income  group  to  another.  Thus,  unlike  inequality  the  concept  of \npolarization is closely related to social segregation and income mobility.  \n\nTurning  to  measurement  of  polarization,  Foster  and  Wolfson  (1992,  2010)  propose  a \npolarization index, capturing \u201cincreased spread,\u201d the classical example of which is the \nrich  becoming  richer  and  the  poor  becoming  poorer.  Esteban  and  Ray  (1994)  and \nDuclos et al. (2004) conceptualize income polarization into an \u201cidentification\u2013alienation\u201d \nframework.  The  \u201calienation\u201d  component  represents  the  extent  of  income  difference \nbetween  individuals.  The  \u201cidentification\u201d  component  captures  the  phenomenon  of \n\u201cclustering  around  extreme  income  poles,\u201d  reflecting  income  group  densities.  Within \neach  group,  individuals  share  common  social  identity  and  have  similar  interests.  It  is \nwell  known  that  a  person\u2019s  behavior  is  strongly  influenced  by  the  group  the  person \ninteracts  with  (Glaeser  et  al.  1996,  Bayer  et  al.  2007)  and  people  in  lower  income \ngroups have lower cost of crime. \n\nDespite the relevance of polarization to crimes, no previous attempt has been made to \nmodel  the  relationship  between  crimes  and  polarization,  using  the  DER  index.  The  \nbi-polarization index of Foster and Wolfson (1992, 2010) is not considered in this paper \nbecause  it  assumes  existence  of  only  two  poles  of  income  distribution. 3 Also,  when \ncomputing the bi-polarization indicators, it is necessary to split the data sample and the \npoint  of  split  is  arbitrarily  set  at  the  median  income  (Esteban  and  Ray  2005).  On  the \ncontrary, the DER index of Duclos et al. (2004) lets data determine the number of poles \nand the point(s) of splits. \n\n3.

Some  studies  found  that  better  living  standard  reduces  violence \ndue  to  better  social  control  and  self-regulation  (Patterson  1991;  Fowles  and  Merva \n1996).  However,  others  found  a  positive  association  between  economic  development \nand crime as more affluence means larger potential loot from crimes (Fanjzylber et al. \n1998).  Net  migration  is  included  in  our  model.  Immigrants  usually  experience  higher \nthan  average  levels  of  unemployment  and  lower  incomes  and  often  suffer  from \ndiscrimination  and  barriers  to  housing,  education,  career  opportunities,  and  political \nparticipation  (Wortley  2003).  These  produce  both  absolute  and  relative  deprivation, \nwhich can cause criminal behaviors. Some immigrant groups may be more involved in \n\n                                                \n3   According  to  Foster  and  Wolfson  (1992,  2010),  the  bi-polarization  indicator  can  be  expressed  as \n denote  the  between  group  inequality,  within  group \n\nwhere \n\n,  and \n\n, \n\n, \n\ninequality, the sample mean, and median income of the income distribution, respectively. \nFW = (G\n\n\u2212 G\n\nm\n\nG\n\nG\n\n\u00b5\n\n)\n\nB\n\nW\n\nW\n\nB\n\n\u00b5\nm, \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\ncriminality  than  others.  For  example,  Rattner  (2007)  found  that  Russian  Federation \nimmigrants  in  Israel  commit  a  higher  crime  rate  than  native  Israelis.  They  are \nresponsible for most of the organized crimes in the Netherlands (Siegel and Bovenkerk \n2007). Finally, we also control police expenditure, although Edlund et al. (2008) find its \ncorrelation with crime insignificant.  \n\nOther  control  variables  include  population  density  (number  of  population/square \nkilometer)  which  affects  the  probability  of  acquiring  the  information  necessary  to \nperform  a  crime  (Sjoquist  1973),  urbanization  rate  measured  as  the  ratio  of  urban \nresidents to the total population is also employed, since urban areas provide better job \nopportunities and stronger police force. \n\n3.2  Data \n\nUnless  indicated  otherwise,  all  data  are  sourced  from  China  Statistical  Yearbooks, \npublished  by  the  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  (NBS).  Two  crime  indicators  from  the \nProcuratorial  Yearbooks  of  China  will  be  used  as  the  dependent  variable:  criminal \narrests  and  criminal  prosecutions  per  10,000  population. 4  They  are  likely  to \nunderestimate  the  true  level  of  crimes.5 This,  however,  does  not  represent  a  problem \nas  long  as  they  are  consistent  over  time  and  across  locations.  We  mainly  focus  on \nprosecution rates since there are non-criminals who were arrested but not prosecuted.  \n\nTo construct the income polarization and income inequality measures at the provincial \nlevel,  grouped  data  are  ungrouped  using  the  method  of  Shorrocks  and  Wan  (2009). 6 \nThe  conventional  inequality  indices  of  Gini  and  Theil  and  the  DER  index  of  Duclos, \nEstaban,  and  Ray  (2004)  are  then  computed.  The  latter  is  estimated  applying  the \ncommonly  used  parameter \n indicates  absence  of \npolarization, whereas an index of \n\n indicates complete polarization. \n\n. 7  A  DER  index  of \n\n\u03b1 = 0.5\n\n\u03b1 = 0\n\nThe  data  sample  covers  the  period  of  1985\u20132008,  due  to  the  availability  of  grouping \nincome data. The descriptive analyses for crime and income polarization apply the full \nsample  while  our  empirical  estimations  are  based  on  the  sample  from  1988  to  2006, \ndue to the data availability for all variables. Table 1 presents the summary statistics for \nthe empirical analyses. \n\n\u03b1 = 1\n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n4   Criminal  activities  include  homicide,  intentional  injury  causing  serious  injury  or  death,  rape,  robbery, \n\ndrug trafficking, arson, explosion, and poisoning. \n\n5   According  to  Brush  (2007),  this  bias  may  also  be  related  to  income  disparity.  For  example,  in \nimpoverished  areas  people  are  less  likely  to  report  crimes;  police  in  underfunded  department  do  not \nrecord all crimes conscientiously. \n\n6   This  technique  is capable  of  reproducing individual  data  from  grouped statistics  with a  high  degree  of \naccuracy.  It  ensures  that  the  characteristics  of  the  synthetic  income  distribution  exactly  match  the \nreported values. \n\n7   The  formula  for  calculating  income  polarization  is  as  follows  (Duclos  et  al.,  2004,  p.  1744): \n\n,  where\n\n, \n\n and \n\n are  income  of  two  different  individuals,  and \n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc53, \ud835\udefc) \n,  the  DER  index  reduces  to  the  Gini  coefficient: \n\n are  the  density  functions.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n\n4.1  Descriptive Statistics \n\nFigure  1  shows  the  increasing  trends  of  crime  rates  and  income  polarization  for  the \nPRC  as  a  whole.  During  the  period  under  study,  the  crime rate  increased  remarkably \nwith  three  peaks  in  1996,  2001,  and  2006  (see  the  left  panel  of  Figure  1),  implying \ngrowing social tensions and social conflicts. Income polarization exhibits an inverted U \npattern (see the right panel). It increased significantly from 1986 to 1994, reaching the \npeak  in  2003.  Although  decreased  after  2003,  the  level  of  polarization  remains  high \ncompared to early years. This trend broadly corresponds to that of the prosecution rate. \n\nFigure 1: Trends of Crime Rates and Income Polarization, 1985\u20132008  \n\nSource: Procuratorial Yearbook of China and NBS; own calculations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nProvince-level crimes share similar trends with the national counterpart although there \nare substantial variations across provinces. Figures 2 plots the data for 1988 and 2006. \nObserved  crimes  in  1988  were  most  severe  in  Beijing,  Jilin,  and  Guizhou  while  least \nsevere  in  Tibet,  Shandong,  and  Hebei.  The  situation  changed  in  2006  when  Beijing, \nZhejiang,  and  Guangdong  had  the  most  severe  crimes  and  provinces  with  the  least \ncrimes were Anhui and Shanxi. Regarding changes in crimes, the largest increase was \nfound in Zhejiang, followed by Guangdong, Beijing, and Fujian. Only two provinces had \nan attenuating trend throughout the entire period: Hubei and Shanxi. \n\nFigure 2: Provincial Crime Rates in 1988 and 2006 \n\n \n\nNote: Since there are many observations not available in 2008, we present the year 2006 as the latest year instead of \n2008. Mean 19 provinces excludes Gansu, Guizhou, Hainan, Jilin, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and \nTibet.  For  some  provinces,  data  year  are  around  1988  (Beijing,  Guangxi,  Guizhou,  Hunan,  Ningxia,  Shanxi,  Tianjin, \nXinjiang,  Yunnan,  and  Zhejiang, 1989;  Jiangsu  and Jilin,  1990;  Hubei,  1991;  Inner  Mongolia,  1993) and  around  2006 \n(Shanxi and Sichuan, 2005). \n\nSource: Procuratorial Yearbook of China. \n\nFigure 3 plots 1988 and 2006 estimates of income polarization at the provincial level. In \n1988, Yunan, Xinjiang, and Tibet were most polarized while the least polarized regions \nwere Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. In 2006, Yunnan and Xinjiang remained the most \npolarized  while  Gansu  replaced  Tibet  as  one  of  the  most  polarized  regions.  At  the \nsame  time,  Beijing,  Liaoning,  and  Jiangxi  were  least  polarized.  In  the  majority  of \nprovinces,  income  polarization  grew,  with  the  largest  growth  in  Yunnan,  followed  by \nAnhui,  Henan,  and  Zhejiang.  However,  Hebei  experienced  a  slight  decrease  from \n0.239 in 1988 to 0.236 in 2006. \n\nInterestingly, high income polarizations did not occur in rich provinces but in the west or \nsouthwest\u2014Yunnan,  Xinjiang,  and  Gansu.  This  may  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the \nwest possesses a relatively larger agriculture sector and the urban\u2013rural gap is larger, \ntoo.  The  descriptive  statistics  also  indicate  that  in  most  provinces  where  the  income \npolarization increased, the crime rates also increased.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nFigure 3: Provincial Income Polarization in 1988 and 2006 \n\n \n\nNote: Since there are many observations not available in 2008, we present the year 2006 as the latest year instead of \n2008.

All regressions in Table 2 include year and province fixed effects except for \nM2.5  and  M2.6  which  use  province  dummies,  criminal  records  adjustment,  and \nintensive crackdowns dummies. It is clear that the coefficient of income polarization is \npositive  and  significant  under  every  model  except  for  M2.1,  which  is  most  likely  to \nsuffer from the problem of omitted variables. \n\nM2.2 controls the level of economic development, expenditure on police as percentage \nof GDP, and net migration. In M2.3 and M2.4, additional variables are controlled. When \ncriminal  records  adjustment  and  intensive  crackdowns  dummies  are  considered \ninstead of year fixed effects (see M2.5 and M2.6), the estimates for the coefficients of \nincome polarization become even larger. \n\nWe  explore  the  robustness  of  our  findings  by  using  criminal  arrest  rates  as  the \ndependent  variable  (Table  3).  The  result  shows  that  the  crime-enhancing  effect  of \nincome polarization remains unchanged.  \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nTable 2: Panel Data Regressions of Crime Rate and Income Polarization \n\nCrime \n\nM2.2 \n\nM2.3 \n\nM2.4 \n\nM2.5 \n\nM2.6 \n\nIncome polarization \n\n0.087** \n\n0.080** \n\n0.080** \n\n0.112***  0.113*** \n\nM2.1 \n\n0.019 \n\n[0.46] \n\n[2.59] \n\n[2.46] \n\n[2.46] \n\n[3.01] \n\n[3.04] \n\n0.272***  0.302***  0.302***  0.275***  0.268*** \n\n[8.35] \n\n[8.31] \n\n[8.31] \n\n[8.86] \n\n[8.22] \n\n0.157***  0.164***  0.164***  0.164***  0.160*** \n\n[2.93] \n\n0.007 \n\n[1.00] \n\n[3.11] \n\n0.006 \n\n[0.85] \n\n[3.11] \n\n0.006 \n\n[0.85] \n\n[2.93] \n\n0.007 \n\n[0.88] \n\n[2.85] \n\n0.007 \n\n[0.99] \n\n\u20130.004 \n\n\u20130.004 \n\n\u20130.001 \n\n\u20130.000 \n\n[\u20131.05] \n\n[\u20131.05] \n\n[\u20130.19] \n\n[\u20130.06] \n\n\u20130.021***  \u20130.021***  \u20130.023***  \u20130.022*** \n\n[\u20133.31] \n\n[\u20133.31] \n\n[\u20133.50] \n\n[\u20133.34] \n\n\u20130.007 \n\n\u20130.040 \n\n\u20130.023 \n\n[\u20130.22] \n\n[\u20131.44] \n\n[\u20130.70] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u20130.131 \n\n\u20130.073 \n\n[\u20130.59] \n\n[\u20130.32] \n\n0.978***  0.958*** \n\n[3.69] \n\n[3.62] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1.869 \n\n[1.23] \n\nY \n\nN \n\n\u20130.031 \n\n[\u20130.11] \n\n0.240 \n\n[0.99] \n\n1.492 \n\n[0.94] \n\nY \n\nN \n\n \nGDP per capita \n\n \nPolice expenditure \n\n \nMigration \n\n \nPopulation density \n\n \nUrbanization \n\n \nTrend \n\nIntensive crackdown in 1996 \n\nIntensive crackdown in 2001 \n\nRecord adjustment in 1989 \n\n \nRecord adjustment in 1992 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nConstant \n\nProvincial FE \n\nYear FE \n\n \n3.300*** \n\n[3.11] \n\n \n0.189 \n\n[0.20] \n\n \n2.559* \n\n \n2.566* \n\n[1.66] \n\n[1.66] \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nNo. of observations \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\nAdj R-sq \n\n0.789 \n\n0.882 \n\n0.886 \n\n0.886 \n\n0.854 \n\n0.854 \n\nNote: t values in brackets; * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nTable 3: Panel Data Regressions of Crime Rate (Arrest Rate)  \nand Income Polarization \n\n Crime \n\nM3.2 \n\nM3.3 \n\nM3.4 \n\nM3.5 \n\nM3.6 \n\nIncome polarization \n\n0.069** \n\n0.064** \n\n0.064** \n\n0.083** \n\n0.082** \n\nM3.1 \n\n0.008 \n\n[0.19] \n\n \nGDP per capita \n\n \nPolice expenditure \n\n \nMigration \n\n \nPopulation density \n\n \nUrbanization \n\n \nTrend \n\nIntensive crackdown in 1996 \n\nIntensive crackdown in 2001 \n\nRecord adjustment in 1989 \n\n \nRecord adjustment in 1992 \n\n \nConstant \n\nProvincial FE \n\nYear FE \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n[2.07] \n\n[2.01] \n\n[2.01] \n\n[2.48] \n\n[2.45] \n\n0.219***  0.234***  0.234***  0.198***  0.193*** \n\n[8.11] \n\n[7.91] \n\n[7.91] \n\n[7.47] \n\n[7.01] \n\n0.142***  0.150***  0.150***  0.133***  0.133*** \n\n[3.03] \n\n[3.30] \n\n[3.30] \n\n[2.78] \n\n[2.79] \n\n0.011** \n\n0.010* \n\n0.010* \n\n0.012* \n\n0.013* \n\n[2.00] \n\n[1.80] \n\n[1.80] \n\n\u20130.000 \n\n\u20130.000 \n\n[\u20130.07] \n\n[\u20130.07] \n\n[1.85] \n\n0.004 \n\n[1.02] \n\n[1.90] \n\n0.004 \n\n[1.13] \n\n\u20130.028***  \u20130.028***  \u20130.028***  \u20130.028*** \n\n[\u20134.18] \n\n[\u20134.18] \n\n[\u20134.08] \n\n[\u20133.96] \n\n\u20130.021 \n\n\u20130.037 \n\n\u20130.027 \n\n[\u20130.69] \n\n[\u20131.52] \n\n[\u20130.94] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.026 \n\n[0.15] \n\n0.057 \n\n[0.31] \n\n1.137***  1.124*** \n\n[5.43] \n\n[5.35] \n\n0.198 \n\n[0.76] \n\n0.064 \n\n[0.29] \n\n1.550 \n\n[1.09] \n\nY \n\nN \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nY \n\nN \n\n3.664*** \n\n[3.51] \n\n0.920 \n\n[0.99] \n\n2.251 \n\n[1.56] \n\n2.272 \n\n[1.57] \n\n1.790 \n\n[1.30] \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nY \n\nNo. of observations \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\n384 \n\nAdj R-sq \n\n0.759 \n\n0.857 \n\n0.867 \n\n0.867 \n\n0.839 \n\n0.838 \n\nNote: t values in parentheses; * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. \n\nWe further carry out robustness check using two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation \nbecause crime rates may also affect income polarization or inequality. As stressed by \nEnamorado et al. (2016), higher crime rates can diminish the stock of physical capital \nand  development  of  human  capital,  raise  segregation  and  erode  social  capital,  affect \nthe capacity of local government and economic activity, and increase the incentives to \nmigrate  to  safer  areas.  In  this  paper,  lagged  income  polarization  is  used  as  the \ninstrumental  variable.  Once  again,  the  results  are  found  to  be  robust  and  the  effect \nbecomes even greater with 2SLS estimation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nTable 4: Panel Data Regressions (2SLS) of Crime Rate and Income Polarization \n\n Crime \n\nIncome polarization \n\nM4.1 \n\n\u20130.022 \n\n[\u20130.25] \n\nM4.2 \n\nM4.3 \n\nM4.4 \n\nM4.5 \n\nM4.6 \n\n0.138* \n\n0.114* \n\n0.114* \n\n0.235*** \n\n0.234*** \n\n[1.88] \n\n[1.67] \n\n[1.67] \n\n[3.22] \n\n[3.21] \n\nGDP per capita \n\n0.015*** \n\n0.015*** \n\n0.015*** \n\n0.016*** \n\n0.017*** \n\nPolice expenditure \n\n0.259*** \n\n0.294*** \n\n0.294*** \n\n0.279*** \n\n0.271*** \n\n[2.98] \n\n[3.04] \n\n[3.04] \n\n[3.23] \n\n[3.32] \n\nIntensive crackdown in 2001 \n\n1.255*** \n\n1.235*** \n\nMigration \n\nPopulation density \n\nUrbanization \n\nTrend \n\nIntensive crackdown in 1996 \n\nRecord adjustment in 1989 \n\nRecord adjustment in 1992 \n\nProvincial FE \n\nYear FE \n\nNo. of observations \n\nAdj R\u2013sq \n\nIdp \n\nCdf \n\nWidstat \n\n[7.70] \n\n[7.94] \n\n[7.94] \n\n[8.62] \n\n[8.21] \n\n0.188*** \n\n0.183*** \n\n0.183*** \n\n0.202*** \n\n0.195*** \n\n[3.48] \n\n[3.62] \n\n\u20130.005 \n\n[\u20131.17] \n\n[3.62] \n\n\u20130.005 \n\n[\u20131.17] \n\n[3.73] \n\n\u20130.002 \n\n[\u20130.49] \n\n[3.56] \n\n\u20130.001 \n\n[\u20130.37] \n\n\u20130.030***  \u20130.030***  \u20130.030***  \u20130.029*** \n\n[\u20133.75] \n\n[\u20133.75] \n\n[\u20133.35] \n\n[\u20133.22] \n\n\u20130.185 \n\n\u20130.072** \n\n\u20130.051 \n\n[\u20130.49] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n[\u20132.05] \n\n\u20130.254 \n\n[\u20131.09] \n\n[5.18] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nY \n\nN \n\n332 \n\n0.644 \n\n0.000 \n\n83.115 \n\n46.672 \n\n[\u20131.31] \n\n\u20130.179 \n\n[\u20130.75] \n\n[5.13] \n\n\u20130.066 \n\n[\u20130.20] \n\n0.337 \n\n[1.36] \n\nY \n\nN \n\n332 \n\n0.645 \n\n0.000 \n\n82.546 \n\n45.213 \n\nY \n\nY \n\n332 \n\n0.457 \n\n0.000 \n\n76.722 \n\n34.436 \n\nY \n\nY \n\n332 \n\n0.700 \n\n0.000 \n\n70.694 \n\n30.966 \n\nY \n\nY \n\n332 \n\n0.718 \n\n0.000 \n\n69.894 \n\n30.617 \n\nY \n\nY \n\n332 \n\n0.718 \n\n0.000 \n\n69.894 \n\n30.617 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: t values in parentheses; * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. \n\nIt  is  useful  to  look  at  the  impacts  of  the  control  variables.  GDP  per  capita  is  found  to \nexert  a  strong  crime-enhancing  effect.  Fast  growth  in  post-reform  PRC  certainly  has  \nled to improvements in people\u2019s well-being and significant poverty reduction. However, \nit  also  increases  the  marginal  benefit  and  incentives  to  crime.  Moreover,  gains  from \ngrowth  have  been  unequally  or  even  unfairly  distributed  among  individuals  and \npopulation subgroups. It is not surprising that this kind of growth is positively correlated \nwith rising crimes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nPolice  expenditure,  surprisingly,  exerts  a  positive  and  significant  effect  on  crimes  in  \nall  models.8 One  possible  explanation  is  that  increase  in  the  policy  expenditure  helps \ninvestigating  more  hidden  criminal  activities.  Another  possibility  is  that  a  reverse \ncausality exists here, which can be investigated in future research.  \n\nTurning to urbanization, the results show that higher level of urbanization is negatively \nand  significantly  associated  with  both  crime  rates.  This  suggests  that  the  crime-\ninducing  effects  of  urbanization  are  more  than  offset  by  its  crime-reducing  effects.  \nIn particular, urbanization provides job opportunities for poor and rural migrants. Thus, \nwhen  the  migration  flow  is  controlled  in  the  model,  urbanization  turns  out  to  be \nassociated with less criminal activities.  \n\n4.3  Income Inequality, Income Polarization, and Crime \n\nWhat would happen if income inequality instead of polarization is used as the proxy of \nincome distribution? Table 5 indicates that the Gini index is insignificant in model M5.1. \nWhen  using  the  Theil  index,  income  inequality  becomes  insignificant  for  all  models \n(M5.4,  5.5,  and  5.6).  More  interestingly,  when  both  income  polarization  and  income \ninequality  indicators  are included,  the coefficient of  income  polarization  is  still  positive \nand significant while those of the Gini coefficient and Theil index become insignificant \nor even negative.  \n\nAll these support and confirm the superiority of the polarization index over conventional \ninequality measures as indicators of income distribution in modeling crimes.  \n\n4.4  Income Polarization, Economic Growth and Crime \n\nAs mentioned earlier, growth in GDP per capita may be associated with more criminal \nactivities.  It  is  thus  interesting  to  explore  whether  the  detrimental  impacts  of  income \npolarization  vary  as  income  level  changes.  Toward  this  purpose,  we  introduce  the \ninteraction of income polarization and GDP per capita, as well as its square term to the \nbaseline model: \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n2\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \u2217 (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61)\n+\ud835\udf02\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n\nAccording to model (2), the effect of income polarization on crime is: \n\n\u2032\n\n+ \ud835\udf03\n\n\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \n\n. \n\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n2\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefd + \ud835\udefd1 \u2217 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd2 \u2217 (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61)\n\n. \n\nThe  estimation  results  of  model  (2)  are  reported  in  Table  7,  which  shows  that  the \ncoefficient  of  the  interaction  term  is  significantly  positive  and  the  coefficient  of  the \nsquare  term  is  significantly  negative,  indicating  that  the  detrimental  effect  of  income \npolarization on crime is larger in richer areas or as the economy grows. However, the \neffect  is  expected  to  decrease  when  per  capita  GDP  reaches  a  threshold  level, \nestimated to be 63163.37 yuan.9 \n\n                                                \n8   Considering the reverse causality, we also use 2SLS estimation with lagged police expenditure as the \ninstrumental variable of the police expenditure.

SUMMARY \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nWhen  exploring  the  relationship  between  crime  and  income  distribution,  income \ninequality  is  commonly  used  as  the  proxy  of  the  latter  (Enamorado  et  al.  2016). \nHowever,  as  this  paper  demonstrates,  rather  than  income  inequality,  income \npolarization  captures  much  better  the  effects  of  social  tension  and  conflict  that  a \nworsening income distribution generates. Therefore, this study contributes to the crime \nliterature by modeling the effect of income polarization on criminal prosecution rates in \nthe PRC for the period 1985\u20132008. \n\nThe  descriptive  analyses  show  that  the  highest  level  of  crime  rate  was  found  in  rich \nprovinces,  such  as  Beijing  and  Zhejiang.  Regarding  income  polarization,  the  highest \nlevel was found in the western PRC. During the period under study, both the levels of \ncrime rate and income polarization increased on average. \n\nOur  modeling  results  suggest  that,  in  general,  income  polarization  is  positively  and \nsignificantly related to the criminal prosecution rate. This result is confirmed by several \nsensitivity  analyses.  Regarding  income  inequality,  we  do  not  find  it  has  a  significant \nrelationship with crime. When incorporating income inequality and income polarization \nin  one  model,  the  former  still  does  not  show  any  significance  while  the  latter  does. \nThese findings support our argument that income polarization is more closely linked to \ncrime  than  income  inequality.  In  addition,  we  find  that  the  positive  effect  of  income \npolarization on crime is larger in richer area, and then this effect decreased with further \neconomic  development.  It  reminds  us  to  put  more  attention  and  effort  on  income \npolarization during the process of economic development. \n\nTo  tackle  the  rising  trend  of  crime,  several  policy  suggestions  could  be  taken  into \naccount.  First,  the  government  should  enhance  pro-poor  economic  development,  to \nmitigate income polarization. The PRC has already pulled tons of people out of poverty \nsince decades ago. However, there are still around 50 million rural people living under \nthe  poverty  line  (below  2300  yuan  per  year  or  $1  per  day),  as  reported  by  Statistical \nCommuniqu\u00e9  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  on  the  2015  National  Economic  and \nSocial  Development  published  by  NBS.  Pro-poor  growth  combines  economic  growth \nand  poverty  reduction  together,  absorbing  labor  in  lower  income  groups.  Second, \nurbanization should be enhanced and accelerated. More specifically, social-integration-\nrelated policies should be enhanced to eliminate discrimination in the labor market and \nincrease both educational and employment opportunities for migrants. \n\nFinally, this study does not distinguish the types of crime. Future work will examine the \nimpact of income polarization on different criminal activities. Moreover, this study does \nnot examine whether the effect of income polarization on crime is larger in urban areas \nthan  in  rural  areas.  Since  crime  activity  is  more  intensive  in  urban  areas,  studies \nexamining  the  impact  of  income  polarization  on  urban  crime  could  provide  more \ntargeted policy implications. \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 704 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nWang, Wan, and Zhang \n\nBaharom, A. and M.

This  paper  argues  that  income \npolarization  rather  than  inequality  should  be  taken  into  account  in  the  context  of  crime \nanalysis.  Technically,  in  addition  to  income  gaps  as  captured  by  inequality  indicators,  the \nrecently  developed  polarization  index  of  Duclos,  Esteban,  and  Ray  (2004)  also  measures \nsocial  segregation,  which  implies  immobility  and  alienation,  both  of  which  are  closely  \nrelated  to  social  tensions  and  conflicts.  Thus,  this  polarization  index  is  expected  to  be  a \nbetter  variable  in  explaining  crime.  To  substantiate  our  arguments,  provincial  panel  data  \nfrom the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) are used to model the crime\u2013income distribution \nrelationship.  Income  polarization  is  found  to  be  positively  and  significantly  associated  \nwith  crime.  When  both  income  polarization  and  inequality  indicators  are  included  in  \nthe  models,  the  former  remains  a  positive  and  significant  determinant  while  the  latter \nbecomes insignificant. \n \nJEL Classification: D31, K4 \n \n", " \n"]}
