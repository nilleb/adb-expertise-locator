INTRODUCTION \nAs argued by Loayza et al. (2000), among others, criminal activities act like a tax on \nthe entire economy, discouraging domestic and foreign direct investment, reducing \nfirms\u2019  competitiveness,  diverting  resources  to  nonproductive  use,  and  creating \nuncertainty  and  inefficiency.  Also,  individuals  who  have  contacts  with  the  criminal \njustice  system  face  less  chance  of  employment,  which  increases  the  cost  of  job \nmatching and unemployment (Borland and Hunter 1999). More generally, crimes impair \nquality of life anywhere and everywhere, adversely affecting happiness and health \n(Robinson and Keithley 2000; Davies and Hinks 2010). Some directly cause fear, pain, \nand suffering (Detotto and Otranto 2010). \nTo contain or fight crimes, it is vital to identify and analyze the determinants. One of \nthem is income distribution (Backer 1968; Merlo 2003). As pointed out by Thurow \n(1971),  preventing  crime  and  creating  social  or  political  stability  may  depend  on \npreserving  a  narrow  distribution  of  income.  In  modeling  the  relationship  between \nincome distribution and crime, the conventional practice is to use inequality indicators \nsuch as the Gini coefficient (Enamorado et al. 2016). However, inequality indicators \nonly measure income differences. They do not capture clustering of individuals, which \nhas implications on social segregation or alienation. As criminologists point out, those \nwho  are  alienated  in  a  community  or  society  are  more  likely  to  commit  crimes \n(Patterson 1991). Further, in a segregated society or when a population group is \nalienated, upward income mobility would be low for the disadvantaged. According to \nFriedman (1962), two societies with the same income inequality, the one with greater \nincome mobility would be more equal in the long run.  \nThus, it appears preferable to use measures of income distribution that can capture \nsegregation and alienation of individuals when exploring the income distribution\u2013crime \nrelationship. Interestingly, the recently developed polarization indices can capture both \nthe income differences and social segregation (Foster and Wolfson 1992, 2010). By \ndefinition, polarization describes the extent of population clustering with homogeneous \nindividuals within each cluster but heterogeneous individuals across clusters (Esteban \nand Ray 1994). In a polarizing society, population clusters become more and more \nsharply distinguished from one another in wealth and power, resulting in immobility and \nlow social integration (Deutsch 1971). In particular, income polarization is found to be \nclosely related to social unrest (Esteban and Ray 1994). \nThis paper contributes to the literature by introducing polarization into crime modeling \nand by exploring the determinants of crime in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nusing the index of Duclos, Estaban, and Ray (2004) or DER index hereafter.1 We  \nfocus on the post-reform period in the PRC when income distribution worsened and  \ncrime rates rose significantly.2 It is found that income polarization is positively and \nsignificantly associated with crimes while the coefficients of inequality indicators are \nless significant or insignificant. When the DER index and an inequality indicator are \nboth included in the same model, the coefficient of the former remains positive and \nsignificant while that of the latter becomes insignificant with unexpected signs. \n                                                \n1  Pioneer studies on this subject are, for example, Foster and Wolfson (1992, 2010), Esteban and Ray \n(1994), Wang and Tsui (2000), Zhang and Kanbur (2001), and Duclos, Estaban, and Ray (2004). \n2  Official statistics show that criminals arrested by the People\u2019s Procuratorate increased from 598,101 in \n1998 to 896, 403 in 2013, nearly 1.5 times within 15 years (National Bureau of Statistics 1998, 2013). \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 704  Wang, Wan, and Zhang \n \nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review, followed by \nmodel specification and data description in section 3. Section 4 presents empirical \nresults and sensitivity analyses. Section 5 concludes, with policy implications.  \n2.  CRIME, INCOME INEQUALITY, AND INCOME \nPOLARIZATION: LITERATURE REVIEW \nThe economic literature on crime can be traced back to Becker (1968), who establishes \nthat a rational decision of criminal acts is based on cost\u2013benefit analysis. The expected \nnet  benefit  is  the  difference  between  the  loot  and  the  opportunity  cost  of  crime  \nsuch as penalties imposed on apprehended criminals. According to Ehrlich (1973), \ninequality  induces  crimes  because  of  large  differences  between  the  expected  \ngains from successful crime and returns from legitimate work for the poor. This link \nbetween inequality and crime was further examined in a general equilibrium model by \n\u0130mrohoro\u011flu, Merlo, and Rupert (2000), where the crime rate, the levels of expenditures \nfor police protection, and income redistribution are simultaneously determined. They \nshow  that  increases  in  the  variance  of  wage lead  to  higher  crime  rates.  Using  a \ndynamic equilibrium model, \u0130mrohoro\u011flu et al. (2004) find that when income inequality \nincreases in the United States (US), more people engage in criminal activities. \nTo empirically model the relationship between income distribution and crime, almost all \nstudies employ inequality indicators as proxies of income distribution. And research \nfindings are mixed. For instance, Chiu and Madden (1988) examine the effects of \nincome inequality on the level of burglary. They argue that individuals with low earnings \npotentially have a greater incentive to take risks and engage in burglary. The rich \nbecome potential burglary victims. Their empirical results show that the number of \nburglaries increases as inequality increases. Fowles and Merva (1996) find that wage \ninequality is positively linked to violent crimes. Ehrlich (1973) and Hsieh and Pugh \n(1993) argue that rising income inequality breads crime, as confirmed by Blau and Blau \n(1982) and Kelly (2000) using data on violent crime from the US. Fajnzylber et al. \n(2002)  find  a  two-way  causality  between  crime  and  income  inequality.  Using  an \ninstrument variable approach, Enamorado et al. (2016) find that between 2006 and \n2010, a one percentage point rise in the Gini coefficient translates into an increase of \nmore than 10 drug-related homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. Using data from the \nPRC, crime rate is also found to be positively correlated with intra-provincial inequality \n(Cheong and Wu 2015). \nContrary to the above findings, other studies demonstrate that income inequality is \nnegatively correlated or uncorrelated with crimes. Using county-level data from the US, \nBrush (2007) finds a negative relationship between income inequality and crime rates \nin the time-series setting although the relationship is positive in the cross-sectional \nsetting. The negative correlation is also found by Baharom and Habibullah (2009), who \nuse 1973\u20132003 data from Malaysia. Chintrakarn and Herzer (2012) employ state-level \npanel data for the period 1965\u20132005 in the US and find that inequality exerts a robust \ncrime-reducing effect. Finally, Zhang et al. (2011) conclude that there is no robust \nevidence supporting the positive relationship between income inequality and crime in \nthe PRC. \nThese mixed findings could be attributable to the incompleteness of income inequality \nas a proxy of income distribution. As argued earlier, inequality indicators only measure \nincome gaps and do not capture income immobility and social segregation, which are \nperceived to drive crime. On the other hand, income polarization reflects a \u201cdivided \nsociety\u201d (Zhang and Kanbur 2001) where people cannot easily change their social \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 704  Wang, Wan, and Zhang \n \nidentity from one income group to another. Thus, unlike inequality the concept of \npolarization is closely related to social segregation and income mobility.  \nTurning to measurement of polarization, Foster and Wolfson (1992, 2010) propose a \npolarization index, capturing \u201cincreased spread,\u201d the classical example of which is the \nrich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer. Esteban and Ray (1994) and \nDuclos et al. (2004) conceptualize income polarization into an \u201cidentification\u2013alienation\u201d \nframework. The \u201calienation\u201d component represents the extent of income difference \nbetween  individuals.  The  \u201cidentification\u201d  component  captures  the  phenomenon  of \n\u201cclustering around extreme income poles,\u201d reflecting income group densities. Within \neach group, individuals share common social identity and have similar interests. It is \nwell known that a person\u2019s behavior is strongly influenced by the group the person \ninteracts with (Glaeser et al. 1996, Bayer et al. 2007) and people in lower income \ngroups have lower cost of crime. \nDespite the relevance of polarization to crimes, no previous attempt has been made to \nmodel the relationship between crimes and polarization, using the DER index. The  \nbi-polarization index of Foster and Wolfson (1992, 2010) is not considered in this paper \nbecause it assumes existence of only two poles of income distribution.3 Also, when \ncomputing the bi-polarization indicators, it is necessary to split the data sample and the \npoint of split is arbitrarily set at the median income (Esteban and Ray 2005). On the \ncontrary, the DER index of Duclos et al. (2004) lets data determine the number of poles \nand the point(s) of splits. \n3.

Some studies found that better living standard reduces violence \ndue to better social control and self-regulation (Patterson 1991; Fowles and Merva \n1996). However, others found a positive association between economic development \nand crime as more affluence means larger potential loot from crimes (Fanjzylber et al. \n1998). Net migration is included in our model. Immigrants usually experience higher \nthan  average  levels  of  unemployment  and  lower  incomes  and  often  suffer  from \ndiscrimination and barriers to housing, education, career opportunities, and political \nparticipation (Wortley 2003). These produce both absolute and relative deprivation, \nwhich can cause criminal behaviors. Some immigrant groups may be more involved in \n                                                \n3  According to Foster and Wolfson (1992, 2010), the bi-polarization indicator can be expressed as \nwhere  ,  ,  ,  and   denote  the  between  group  inequality,  within  group \ninequalityB, theW sam\u00b5ple mean,B and Wmedian income of the income distribution, respectively. \nFW=(G \u2212G )m,  G G \u00b5 m\n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 704  Wang, Wan, and Zhang \n \ncriminality than others. For example, Rattner (2007) found that Russian Federation \nimmigrants  in  Israel  commit  a  higher  crime  rate  than  native  Israelis.  They  are \nresponsible for most of the organized crimes in the Netherlands (Siegel and Bovenkerk \n2007). Finally, we also control police expenditure, although Edlund et al. (2008) find its \ncorrelation with crime insignificant.  \nOther  control  variables  include  population  density  (number  of  population/square \nkilometer)  which  affects  the  probability  of  acquiring  the  information  necessary  to \nperform a crime (Sjoquist 1973), urbanization rate measured as the ratio of urban \nresidents to the total population is also employed, since urban areas provide better job \nopportunities and stronger police force. \n3.2  Data \nUnless indicated otherwise, all data are sourced from China Statistical Yearbooks, \npublished by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Two crime indicators from the \nProcuratorial Yearbooks of China will be used as the dependent variable: criminal \narrests  and  criminal  prosecutions  per  10,000  population. 4  They  are  likely  to \nunderestimate the true level of crimes.5 This, however, does not represent a problem \nas long as they are consistent over time and across locations. We mainly focus on \nprosecution rates since there are non-criminals who were arrested but not prosecuted.  \nTo construct the income polarization and income inequality measures at the provincial \nlevel, grouped data are ungrouped using the method of Shorrocks and Wan (2009).6 \nThe conventional inequality indices of Gini and Theil and the DER index of Duclos, \nEstaban, and Ray (2004) are then computed. The latter is estimated applying the \ncommonly  used  parameter  .7 A  DER  index  of   indicates  absence  of \npolarization, whereas an index of   indicates complete polarization. \n\u03b1 = 0.5 \u03b1 = 0\nThe data sample covers the period of 1985\u20132008, due to the availability of grouping \n\u03b1 = 1\nincome data. The descriptive analyses for crime and income polarization apply the full \nsample while our empirical estimations are based on the sample from 1988 to 2006, \ndue to the data availability for all variables. Table 1 presents the summary statistics for \nthe empirical analyses. \n   \n                                                \n4  Criminal activities include homicide, intentional injury causing serious injury or death, rape, robbery, \ndrug trafficking, arson, explosion, and poisoning. \n5  According  to  Brush  (2007),  this  bias  may  also  be  related  to  income  disparity.  For  example,  in \nimpoverished areas people are less likely to report crimes; police in underfunded department do not \nrecord all crimes conscientiously. \n6  This technique is capable of reproducing individual data from grouped statistics with a high degree of \naccuracy. It ensures that the characteristics of the synthetic income distribution exactly match the \nreported values. \n7  The formula for calculating income polarization is as follows (Duclos et al., 2004, p. 1744): \n, where ,   and   are income of two different individuals, and \n and 1+\ud835\udefc are the density functions.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n4.1  Descriptive Statistics \nFigure 1 shows the increasing trends of crime rates and income polarization for the \nPRC as a whole. During the period under study, the crime rate increased remarkably \nwith three peaks in 1996, 2001, and 2006 (see the left panel of Figure 1), implying \ngrowing social tensions and social conflicts. Income polarization exhibits an inverted U \npattern (see the right panel). It increased significantly from 1986 to 1994, reaching the \npeak in 2003. Although decreased after 2003, the level of polarization remains high \ncompared to early years. This trend broadly corresponds to that of the prosecution rate. \nFigure 1: Trends of Crime Rates and Income Polarization, 1985\u20132008  \n \nSource: Procuratorial Yearbook of China and NBS; own calculations. \n   \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 704  Wang, Wan, and Zhang \n \nProvince-level crimes share similar trends with the national counterpart although there \nare substantial variations across provinces. Figures 2 plots the data for 1988 and 2006. \nObserved crimes in 1988 were most severe in Beijing, Jilin, and Guizhou while least \nsevere in Tibet, Shandong, and Hebei. The situation changed in 2006 when Beijing, \nZhejiang, and Guangdong had the most severe crimes and provinces with the least \ncrimes were Anhui and Shanxi. Regarding changes in crimes, the largest increase was \nfound in Zhejiang, followed by Guangdong, Beijing, and Fujian. Only two provinces had \nan attenuating trend throughout the entire period: Hubei and Shanxi. \nFigure 2: Provincial Crime Rates in 1988 and 2006 \n \nNote: Since there are many observations not available in 2008, we present the year 2006 as the latest year instead of \n2008.

In \n1988, Yunan, Xinjiang, and Tibet were most polarized while the least polarized regions \nwere Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. In 2006, Yunnan and Xinjiang remained the most \npolarized while Gansu replaced Tibet as one of the most polarized regions. At the \nsame  time,  Beijing,  Liaoning,  and  Jiangxi  were  least  polarized.

However,  Hebei  experienced  a  slight  decrease from \n0.239 in 1988 to 0.236 in 2006. \nInterestingly, high income polarizations did not occur in rich provinces but in the west or \nsouthwest\u2014Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Gansu. This may be attributed to the fact that the \nwest possesses a relatively larger agriculture sector and the urban\u2013rural gap is larger, \ntoo.

GDP per capita is found to \nexert a strong crime-enhancing effect. Fast growth in post-reform PRC certainly has  \nled to improvements in people\u2019s well-being and significant poverty reduction. However, \nit also increases the marginal benefit and incentives to crime. Moreover, gains from \ngrowth  have  been  unequally  or  even  unfairly  distributed  among  individuals  and \npopulation subgroups. It is not surprising that this kind of growth is positively correlated \nwith rising crimes.  \n \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 704  Wang, Wan, and Zhang \n \nPolice expenditure, surprisingly, exerts a positive and significant effect on crimes in  \nall models.8 One possible explanation is that increase in the policy expenditure helps \ninvestigating  more  hidden  criminal  activities.  Another  possibility  is  that  a  reverse \ncausality exists here, which can be investigated in future research.  \nTurning to urbanization, the results show that higher level of urbanization is negatively \nand  significantly  associated  with  both  crime  rates.  This  suggests  that  the  crime-\ninducing effects of urbanization are more than offset by its crime-reducing effects.  \nIn particular, urbanization provides job opportunities for poor and rural migrants. Thus, \nwhen  the  migration  flow  is  controlled  in  the  model,  urbanization  turns  out  to  be \nassociated with less criminal activities.  \n4.3  Income Inequality, Income Polarization, and Crime \nWhat would happen if income inequality instead of polarization is used as the proxy of \nincome distribution? Table 5 indicates that the Gini index is insignificant in model M5.1. \nWhen using the Theil index, income inequality becomes insignificant for all models \n(M5.4, 5.5, and 5.6). More interestingly, when both income polarization and income \ninequality indicators are included, the coefficient of income polarization is still positive \nand significant while those of the Gini coefficient and Theil index become insignificant \nor even negative.  \nAll these support and confirm the superiority of the polarization index over conventional \ninequality measures as indicators of income distribution in modeling crimes.  \n4.4  Income Polarization, Economic Growth and Crime \nAs mentioned earlier, growth in GDP per capita may be associated with more criminal \nactivities. It is thus interesting to explore whether the detrimental impacts of income \npolarization vary as income level changes.

SUMMARY \nWhen  exploring  the  relationship  between  crime  and  income  distribution,  income \ninequality  is  commonly  used  as  the  proxy  of  the  latter  (Enamorado  et  al.  2016). \nHowever,  as  this  paper  demonstrates,  rather  than  income  inequality,  income \npolarization  captures  much  better  the  effects  of  social  tension  and  conflict  that  a \nworsening income distribution generates. Therefore, this study contributes to the crime \nliterature by modeling the effect of income polarization on criminal prosecution rates in \nthe PRC for the period 1985\u20132008. \nThe descriptive analyses show that the highest level of crime rate was found in rich \nprovinces, such as Beijing and Zhejiang. Regarding income polarization, the highest \nlevel was found in the western PRC. During the period under study, both the levels of \ncrime rate and income polarization increased on average. \nOur modeling results suggest that, in general, income polarization is positively and \nsignificantly related to the criminal prosecution rate. This result is confirmed by several \nsensitivity analyses. Regarding income inequality, we do not find it has a significant \nrelationship with crime. When incorporating income inequality and income polarization \nin one model, the former still does not show any significance while the latter does. \nThese findings support our argument that income polarization is more closely linked to \ncrime than income inequality. In addition, we find that the positive effect of income \npolarization on crime is larger in richer area, and then this effect decreased with further \neconomic  development.  It reminds  us  to  put more  attention  and  effort  on  income \npolarization during the process of economic development. \nTo tackle the rising trend of crime, several policy suggestions could be taken into \naccount. First, the government should enhance pro-poor economic development, to \nmitigate income polarization. The PRC has already pulled tons of people out of poverty \nsince decades ago. However, there are still around 50 million rural people living under \nthe poverty line (below 2300 yuan per year or $1 per day), as reported by Statistical \nCommuniqu\u00e9 of the People's Republic of China on the 2015 National Economic and \nSocial Development published by NBS. Pro-poor growth combines economic growth \nand  poverty  reduction  together,  absorbing  labor  in  lower  income  groups.  Second, \nurbanization should be enhanced and accelerated. More specifically, social-integration-\nrelated policies should be enhanced to eliminate discrimination in the labor market and \nincrease both educational and employment opportunities for migrants. \nFinally, this study does not distinguish the types of crime. Future work will examine the \nimpact of income polarization on different criminal activities. Moreover, this study does \nnot examine whether the effect of income polarization on crime is larger in urban areas \nthan in rural areas. Since crime activity is more intensive in urban areas, studies \nexamining  the  impact  of  income  polarization  on  urban  crime  could  provide  more \ntargeted policy implications. \n   \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 704  Wang, Wan, and Zhang \n \nREFERENCES \nBaharom, A. and M.

Consequently, economists have been modeling crime-employing inequality indicators as one of the explanatory variables, yielding mixed results. We argue that income polarization rather than inequality should be taken into account in the context of crime analysis. Technically, in addition to income gaps as captured by inequality indicators, the recently developed polarization index of Duclos, Esteban, and Ray (2004) also measures social segregation, which implies immobility and alienation, both of which are closely related to social tensions and conflicts. Thus, this polarization index is expected to be a better variable in explaining crime. To substantiate our arguments, we use provincial panel data from the People\u2019s Republic of China to model the crime\u2013income distribution relationship. Income polarization is found to be positively and significantly associated with crime. When both income polarization and inequality indicators are included in the models, the former remains a positive and significant determinant while the latter becomes insignificant.", "Title": "Which Dimension of Income Distribution Drives Crime?
