A balance of payments crisis at the time opened the way for\nan  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  program  that  led  to  the\nadoption of a major reform package. Though the foreign-exchange\nreserve recovered quickly and ended effectively the temporary clout\nof the IMF and World Bank, reforms continued in a stop-go fashion.\n\nWhat has been accomplished and what remains to be done?\n\nIs the glass half full or half empty?\n\nThe Good News:  Achievements Thus Far\n\nIndia\u2019s reforms have been piecemeal and incremental, giving\nthe  casual  observer  the  impression  that  nothing  has  been\nhappening. If one takes the totality of reforms over the last decade,\nhowever, the change is unmistakable. The analogy is with the hour\nhand of the clock, which looks completely static, and yet completes\na full circle every 12 hours.\n\nTo  get  an  idea  of  the  accomplishments,  begin  with  the\nindustrial policy prevailing prior to the launching of the reforms. The\nheavy industry was a state monopoly. Other industries were either\nsubject to strict industrial licensing or reserved for the small-scale\nsector. The tight control of the government on industry was aptly\ncaptured by a leading cartoonist in a 1980s comic strip showing the\nindustry  minister  tell  his  staff,  \u201cWe  shouldn\u2019t  encourage  big\nindustry\u2014that is our policy, I know. But I say we shouldn\u2019t encourage\nsmall industries either. If we do, they are bound to become big.\u2026\u201d\n\nThe reforms of the last 10 years have gone a long way toward\nfreeing up the domestic economy from state control. State monopoly\nhas been abolished in virtually all sectors, which have been opened\nto the private sector. The License Raj is a thing of the past. The\n\n\fsmall-scale industry reservation still persists but even here progress\nhas been made. Apparel, with its large export potential, was recently\nopened to all investors.\n\nIn the area of international trade, in 1991, import licensing was\npervasive  with  goods  divided  into  banned,  restricted,  limited\npermissible, and subject to open general licensing (OGL). The OGL\ncategory was the most liberal but it covered only 30 percent of\nimports. Moreover, certain conditions had still to be fulfilled before\nthe permission to import was granted under the OGL system.\n\nImports were also subject to excessively high tariffs. The top\nrate was 400 percent. As much as 60 percent of tariff lines were\nsubject to rates ranging from 110 to 150 percent and only 4 percent\nof the tariff rates were below 60 percent. The exchange rate was\nhighly over-valued. Strict exchange controls applied to not just\ncapital account but also current account transactions. Foreign\ninvestment was subject to stringent restrictions. Companies were not\npermitted more than 40 percent foreign equity unless they were in\nthe high-tech sector or were export-oriented. As a result, foreign\ninvestment amounted to a paltry $100-200 million annually.\n\nToday, import licensing has been completely abolished. This\nincludes textiles and clothing, which remain protected in developed\ncountries through the multi-fiber arrangement. The highest tariff rate\nhas come down to 45 percent (including the tariff surcharge and the\nso-called  Special Additional  Duty)  with  the  average  tariff  rate\ndeclining to less than 25 percent. The foreign investment regime is\nas liberal as in other developing Asian countries.\n\nTen years ago, telecommunications services were a state\nmonopoly and constituted a major bottleneck on the conduct of\nbusiness activity. So callous was the attitude of the government that\nwhen a Member of Parliament complained about poor telephone\nservice in Delhi during the early 1980s, the then telecommunications\nminister went on to remind him that in a poor country like India, the\ntelephone was a luxury. The minister then added that if the Member\nwas unhappy with the service, he could return his phone since many\ncustomers had queued up for it for years!\n\n2\n\n\fToday, the private sector has become an active participant in\nthe telecommunications sector, and the New Telecom Policy issued\nin 1999 sets the target of providing telephones on demand by the\nyear 2002. In many cities, this goal has already been achieved. The\nprovision of cellular mobile as well as fixed service is now open to\nthe  private  sector  including  foreign  investors. As  a  result,  the\ntelecommunications services in India are mushrooming.\n\nProgress  has  also  been  made  in  many  areas  that  were\npreviously off limits to reforms. Insurance has been opened to\nprivate investors, both domestic and foreign. Diesel oil and gas\nprices have undergone some increases. At least symbolic reductions\nhave also been made in fertilizer and food subsidies. The value-\nadded tax has undergone substantial rationalization.\n\nThese reforms have paid handsomely. The economy has\ngrown at more than 6 percent coupled with full macroeconomic\nstability. This compares with a growth rate of 3.5 percent during\n1950-1980. The rate of inflation has been low and foreign exchange\nreserves  are  sufficient  to  finance  imports  for  more  than  eight\nmonths. Rising incomes have helped bring down poverty. According\nto official figures, the proportion of poor in total population has\ndeclined from 40 percent in 1993-1994 to 26 percent in 2000.\n\nBut, perhaps, the greatest change in the last 10 years has been\nin the attitude toward reforms. Whereas the vocal supporters of\nreforms within India were rare during the 1980s, virtually every\npolitical party today recognizes the need for continued reforms.\nDifferences on which reforms to undertake first and at what pace\nstill exist, but few disagree that reforms must continue. Initial fears\nthat changes in governments will bring the reform process to a halt\nor even reverse it have proven to be without foundation.\n\nThe Bad News:  Still a Long Way to Go\n\nThe accomplishments of the past decade are dwarfed only by\nwhat remains to be done. To begin with, the fiscal deficit is in a dire\nstate. The  combined  deficit  at  the  center  and  states  exceeds\n10 percent of GDP. Given an already high debt-to-GDP ratio of\n\n3\n\n\fnearly 60 percent, this deficit is unsustainable; it is also crowding\nout private investment.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of long-run growth, the \u201cold economy\u201d must\nbe further unshackled. A key deficiency of India\u2019s growth process has\nbeen the failure of the conventional industry to pull workers out of\nagriculture into gainful employment. Today, in contrast to virtually\nall successful developing economies, approximately 60 percent of\nIndia\u2019s  workforce  still  remains  in  agriculture. The  revival  of\nconventional industry requires reforms in four key areas. First, a\nlarge number of highly labor-intensive products remain reserved for\nsmall-scale producers. As a result, the labor-intensive industry has\nbeen scuttled in India and, with trade liberalization, will find it almost\nimpossible to survive. This reservation must end with small-scale\nproducers given assistance through alternative measures rather than\na  total  ban  on  large-scale  entry.  Second,  labor  laws  must  be\nreformed so as to restore the employer\u2019s right to layoff workers upon\nadequate compensation to them. At present, firms with 100 or more\nworkers have no legal way to exit since they cannot lay off their\nworkers. This works as a major barrier to entry of new firms on a\nlarge scale: they hesitate to enter into a world that has no exit doors.\nThird, privatization of public sector enterprises needs to be speeded\nup. With almost two thirds of the industrial output of the organized\nsector in these enterprises, it will be difficult to stimulate industrial\ngrowth in the short to medium run without faster privatization. Finally,\ntrade liberalization must proceed apace with all tariffs brought down\nto 15 percent or less in the next three years. Again, this is necessary\nto reallocate production toward labor-intensive products in which\nIndia has comparative advantage. It will also be salutary for poverty\nreduction.\n\nInfrastructure is another important area of reforms. Roads,\nrailways, and ports all need expansion as well as improvement in\nthe quality of service. The government has recently taken steps in\nthis direction, particularly in the area of roads, but the pace remains\nslow.\n\nThe most important area of reforms is perhaps India\u2019s power\nsector. Virtually no sector of the economy\u2014industry, agriculture, or\n\n4\n\n\fservices\u2014can achieve successful transformation without adequate\nsupply  of  power. The  power  sector  has  been  a  government\nmonopoly at the state level and suffers from proverbial inefficiency\nincluding large-scale thefts of electricity in almost every state.\nReforms involving privatization of power generation and distribution\nhave been undertaken in several states recently but no spectacular\nsuccesses have emerged as yet. This is the area with highest\npayoffs for imaginative reforms.\n\nFertilizer and food subsidies pose yet another challenge. As\nmuch as 0.7 percent of GDP goes into fertilizer subsidies. Contrary\nto popular impression, much of this subsidy goes to support the\ninefficient domestic fertilizer industry rather than farmers. In the last\nfive years, the prices for fertilizer paid by farmers have been close\nto  the  world  price.  Guaranteed  rates  of  return  to  fertilizer\nmanufacturers have allowed firms with costs two to three times the\nprice in the world market to stay in business. Likewise, the bulk of\nthe food subsidy has failed to reach the poor. Between food and\nfertilizer subsidies, there is scope for generating savings worth more\nthan 1 percent of GDP.\n\nEconomic reforms of the last decade have virtually bypassed\nagriculture. Besides fertilizers among others, farmers need adequate\nsupply of water and electricity. Currently, these are provided free of\ncharge but their supply is highly unreliable. Farmers must also be\nable to reap the full market price for their product rather than be\nsubject to a procurement price below the market price. Further,\nexport restrictions must be phased out.\n\nThe  need  for  the  expansion  of  primary  education  is  well\nrecognized. But needed as well are reforms in the area of higher\neducation. Universities in India also remain a state monopoly. With\nthe need to cut the fiscal deficit, the state has no resources to spare.\nTherefore, like most other countries including Bangladesh and\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, India must allow the entry of private\nuniversities.\n\nFinancial sector reforms, particularly the reform of banking,\nremain a distant goal. While foreign banks are now allowed freely\n\n5\n\n\fto open branches in India, they have not yet moved in aggressively.\nBanking sector privatization will take time but large efficiency gains\ncould be achieved if labor laws are reformed to restore the hire and\nfire policy. Layoffs in banks have been very difficult, and voluntary\nretirement schemes extremely costly.\n\nFinally, the reform of bureaucracy is essential. The problem\nof a bloated bureaucracy and the need for downsizing it is well\nrecognized.  But  with  policy  making  becoming  an  increasingly\nsophisticated and specialized activity, it is necessary to open the top\nbureaucracy to outside specialists. One proposal, made by the\npresent author, is to open the positions at the level of Joint Secretary\nand  above  to  outsiders  rather  than  limiting  competition  to  the\nexisting bureaucracy as is the current practice.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf India grows at 6 percent per annum on a sustained basis, it\nwill take 14 years to reach the current level of per capita income of\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, 36 years to reach Thailand\u2019s, and 104\nyears  to  reach  that  of  the  United  States.  Thus,  the  need  for\naccelerated growth can hardly be overemphasized. At the same\ntime, the task of implementing reforms in a democracy is complex.\nTherefore, those wishing for rapid reforms will need to be patient.\nThe good news, however, is that the experience of the past decade\nshows that change can occur. Moreover, the success of the reforms\nin delivering growth and poverty reduction must make the road to\nfuture reforms less bumpy. The support for reforms today, though\nfar from universal, is fortunately much stronger than it was 10 years\nago.\n\n6\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["The ERD Policy Brief Series is based on papers or notes prepared\nby ADB staff and their resource persons.
