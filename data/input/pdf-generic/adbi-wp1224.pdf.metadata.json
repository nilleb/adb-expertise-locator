INTRODUCTION \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nDuring  the  last  few  decades,  the  composition  of  the  Thai  population  has  changed \ndramatically  due  to  reduced  fertility  and  the  aging  of  the  population.  In  1964,  the \naverage  number  of  children  per  woman  was  6.3,  decreasing  to  1.6  in  2014  (Institute  \nof Population and Social Research 2014). In 2020, at 1.45, Thailand ranked 183rd out  \nof  199  countries  worldwide  in  its  fertility  rate,  lower  than  neighboring  countries  the \nPhilippines  (2.88),  Malaysia  (2.01),  and  Brunei  Darussalam  (1.85)  (World  Population \nReview 2020). In contrast, Thai life expectancy continued to increase, rising from 59 in \n1964  to  75  in  2015.  The  proportion  of  elderly  persons  (over  60  years  old)  increased \nfrom 5.5% in 1980 to 12.9% in 2010 and is estimated to reach 32% in 2040 (National \nEconomic  and  Social  Development  2013).  Among  all  ASEAN  countries,  Thailand  \nranks second in the percentage of elderly people, after first-placed Singapore (United \nNations 2015).  \n\nThe  global  labor  market  is  transforming  and  faces  challenges  due  to  demographic \nchanges  (ILO  2019).  Recent  studies  have  suggested  that  population  aging  has  an \nimpact on the composition of the workforce, and labor force participation (LFP) relating \nto the aging structure will lead to a new direction for the future labor force (K\u00fchn, Milasi, \nand  Yoon  2018;  Abeliansky  et  al.  2020).  For  several  decades,  widespread  attention \nhas  been  given  to  aging  populations  among  developed  countries,  while  this  has \nbecome  a  recent  phenomenon  and  is  more  severe  in  developing  countries  (Kaushal \n2014).  The  aging  of  the  population  is  accompanied  by  a  higher  probability  that  older \npeople  will  stay  in  the  labor  force,  which  suggests  that  they  tend  to  contribute  more  \nto  the  labor  market  (Schmidt  and  Sevak  2008).  Therefore,  understanding  the  labor \nsupply of older people has become increasingly important for policymakers and future \ndevelopment. \n\nThailand\u2019s  aging  society  faces  many  challenges.  Developing  countries  usually  have \ndifferent  retirement  systems  for  elderly  persons  from  developed  countries  (Giles, \nWang,  and  Cai  2011).  Pension  systems  in  developing  countries,  including  Thailand, \ncan usually be categorized as either formal systems, in which employees in the formal \nsector have a mandatory retirement age and receive a good pension after retirement, \nand pension systems in informal sectors, in which those employees depend on family \nsupport  and  usually  keep  working  after  retirement  age.  The  majority  of  older  workers \nare in the informal sector.  \n\nAccording  to  the  World  Bank  (2012),  elderly  persons  are  the  poorest  age  group  in  \nThai  society.  In  2010,  Thailand\u2019s  overall  poverty  rate  was  7.7%,  while  it  was  10.9%  \nfor elderly persons. Moreover, most elderly poverty occurs in the informal sector. The \nmonthly  subsistence  level  in  Thailand  ranges  from  5,000  to  6,000  baht  per  person \n(Tankulrat  2015a;  Hempornwisan  and  Akarachanon  2014).  In  2007,  over  80%  of  \nthe  aging  population  had  an  income  of  approximately  6,000  baht  or  lower,  and  42% \nreported  that  their  income  was  insufficient  or  barely  sufficient  at  the  time  (National \nStatistical  Office  2007).  Financial  support  from  their  children  is  the  most  important \nsource  of  income  for  elderly  Thai  persons,  while  a  small  proportion  comes  from \npensions and allowances (United Nations 2013).  \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nIn  Thailand,  approximately  two-thirds  of  older  people  reside  with,  or  live  near  their \nchildren,  and  the  co-residence  rate  is  higher  in  urban  areas  than  in  rural  areas  \n(Survey  of  Older  Persons  in  Thailand  [SOPT]  2014).  Co-residence  declined  from  \n77%  in  1986  to  55%  in  2014,  but  that  was  not  the  case  with  monetary  and \nnonmonetary  filial  support,  which  suggests  that  the  trend  toward  smaller  families \ncorrelates with the probability of receiving financial support from adult children (Knodel \nand Teerawichitchainan 2017).  \n\nStudies  on  the  labor  supply  of  older  people  in  developed  countries  have  focused  on \ndifferent factors because of different economic conditions and social security systems, \nwhile  studies  on  developing  countries  have  generally  used  cross-sectional  data  and \nhave  mainly  focused  on  descriptive  analysis  or  have  suffered  from  data  limitations \nwhen  making  estimations.  Although  the  concern  over  the  aging  population  has  also \nbeen addressed by many studies in Thailand, empirical evidence is lacking. \n\nIn  this  study,  we  use  both  Labor  Force  Survey  (LFS)  and  Socio-Economic  Survey \n(SES)  panel  data  to  study  the  determinants  of  the  labor  supply  of  older  people.  LFS \ndata from 1985 to 2017 provide an overview of the basic changes related to the LFP  \nof  older  people,  while  SES  panel  data  from  2005  to  2012  enable  us  to  estimate  \nthe  determinants  of  LFP,  allowing  us  to  better  control  for  the  factors  that  may  be \nassociated  with  older  people\u2019s  preference  for  work,  including  their  own  and  their \nspouse\u2019s pension, self-reported health status, co-residence, and income sources from \nother people or government.  \n\nWe  find  strong  evidence  that  pensions  and  poorer  health  status  reduce  the  LFP  of \nolder  people  in  Thailand.  The  majority  of  older  workers  are  located  in  the  informal \nsector,  where  they  have  a  lower  level  of  education  and  reduced  access  to  social \nsecurity.  While  health  status  is  significant  across  all  analyses,  pensions  have  less \nimpact on lower-status workers, indicating that even if they receive a pension, they may \nstill be too poor to retire. Moreover, we find that co-residence only decreases the LFP \nof older persons in the case of those in rural areas, those of an older age, and those \nwith  a  primary  level  of  education,  who  usually  suffer  from  poverty  and  require  more \nassistance from others than their counterparts.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the background \nof the study. Section 3 presents the literature review, and Section 4 describes the data. \nSection  5  provides  an  overview  of  older  workers  in  Thailand,  and Section  6 analyzes \nthe determinants of older people\u2019s LFP. Section 7 concludes. \n\n2.  BACKGROUND \n\nThe current  Thai  pension system  is  based  on  the  three-pillar  old-age  income  security \nsystem  recommended  by  the  World  Bank  (1994).  The  first  pillar  is  the  universal \nprogram  that  has  the  main  objective  of  protecting  general  households  against  \npoverty, while the second pillar is the occupational pension program, and the third pillar \nconsists of voluntary programs. The pension system comprises the old-age allowance, \na  pay-as-you-go  scheme,  and  a  government  pension  system.  The  target  population  \ncan be separated into three categories covered by the three-pillar system: government \nofficers,  workers  in  the  formal  sector,  and  workers  in  the  informal  sector.  Table  1 \npresents the pension programs under the three-pillar system. \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nTable 1: Thai Pension Programs under Three-Pillar System \n\nProgram \n\nTarget Population \n\nType \n\nFormal and informal workers  Universal \nGovernment officers \nGovernment officers \nFormal workers \n\nMandatory \nMandatory \nMandatory \n\nProgram \nSponsor \n\nIndividual \nGovernment \nGovernment \nEmployer \n\nInformal workers \nAll workers \nFormal and informal workers \nFormal workers \n\nIndividual \nVoluntary \nIndividual \nVoluntary \nVoluntary \nIndividual \nMandatory if listed  Employer \n\n \nPillar I \nPillar II \n \n \n\n \n\nOld-age allowance \nOld civil service pension \nGovernment pension \nSocial security fund (Articles 33 \nand 39) \nSocial security fund (Article 40) \n\nPillar III  Retirement mutual fund  \n \n \n\nNational savings fund \nProvident fund \n\nSource: World Bank (1994, 2012). \n\nThe  funding  structure  and  pensionable  age  differ  under  each  pension  scheme. \nIntroduced  in  1992,  the  old-age  allowance was  expanded  in  2009  and has  been paid \nout  to  the  entire  Thai  population  over  the  age  of  60  (approximately  $20  to  $30  per \nmonth),  except  for  government  employees.  Its  aim  is  to  assist  poor  older  people, \nespecially  those  working  in  the  informal  sector.  The  government  pension  fund  was \nintroduced in 1997, covering government officials with at least 25 years of service, and \nis  payable  at  the  age  of  60.  The  pension  coverage  for  the  private-sector  workforce \nunder the social security system was established in 1999; it required at least 15 years \nof contributions and set 55 as the payable age. The pensionable age of the provident \nfund  is 55,  but  members can  take  a  lump  sum  payment  before  the age  of  55  without \nany tax privilege. The National Savings Fund was introduced in 2011 to assist informal \nand  unemployed  workers,  with  a  pensionable  age  of  60.  The  retirement  mutual  \nfund  that  provides  tax  incentives  for  saving  is  pensionable  at  the  age  of  55 \n(Ratanabanchuen 2019). \n\nAccording to SOPT (2014), although the Thai government has expanded the pension \nsystem, it still makes up a minor portion (below 8%) of older people\u2019s income. Ninety-\nseven percent of older people have more than one source of income, with support from \ntheir  children  accounting  for  the  largest share, but  one  that  has decreased  over time. \nThe second-largest share of income is employment income, which saw an increasing \ntrend from 1994 to 2014. In addition, income from interest, savings, or rent also shows \na growing trend. The old-age allowance accounted for only 3% of the income of elderly \npersons in 2007 and increased to nearly 15% in 2014. Asked their reasons for working, \nover 50% of older people mentioned the need for an income, while the second-largest \nproportion (around 30%) of older people mentioned their desire to maintain their health. \nAs for reasons for not working, the majority of older people suggested that they were \ntoo  old,  and  the  second-most  commonly  given  reason  was  the  need  to  take  care  of \nhome and family (NSO 2003). \n\nInformal  workers  account  for  more  than  half  of  the  Thai  labor  force,  but  they  have  \nmuch  more  limited  access  to  social  security  than  the  other  two  groups  (Fujioka  and \nThangphet  2009;  ILO  2020).  The  government  has  put  much  effort  into  revising  the \npension system to cover more informal workers in recent years, including the recently \nintroduced  universal  pension  allowance  and  two  voluntary  programs 1  for  informal \nworkers. Currently, the old-age allowance, social security fund, retirement mutual fund, \nand National Savings Fund cover informal workers (see Table 1). The primary program \n\n1   The new voluntary programs include the National Savings Fund, the social security fund, and Article 40, \n\nwhich were introduced in 2011. \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nthat helps poor older people is the old-age allowance. It appears to have a significant \nimpact on the reduction of poverty among the elderly. However, given its universality, \nmost  of  the  advantages  benefit  those  who  are  not  poor,  which  casts  doubt  on  its \nefficiency in helping older people.  \n\n3.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nPopulation  aging  and  decreased  fertility  highlight  the  significance  of  understanding  \nthe  determinants  of  the  labor  supply  of  older  people.  Studies  in  developed  countries \nhave  provided  several  explanations  for  the  labor  supply  of  older  people,  including  \ntheir  financial  status,  health  status,  wages,  social  security  income  and  pensions,  and \nrelated  tax  rate  (e.g.,  Gruber  and  Wise  1999;  Kostol  and  Mogstad  2014;  Blau  \nand  Gilleskie  2006).  In  the  US,  Haider  and  Loughran  (2001)  suggested  that  the \nlabor  supply  of  older  workers  consists  mainly  of  the  most  educated,  richest,  and \nhealthiest  individuals,  who  treated  their  work  as  leisure.  Similarly,  Maestas  (2010) \nfound that 24% of retirees return to the labor market and that these returners have \nhigher  pre-retirement  incomes  and  education. Schmidt  and  Sevak  (2008)  found  a \npositive  relationship  between  wages  and  marginal  tax  rates with  the  LFP  of  older \nAmericans. Researchers have demonstrated that pension reform has a significantly \npositive  impact  on  senior  employment  (Engels,  Geyer,  and  Haan  2017;  Manoli  \nand  Weber  2016).  Many  studies  also  focus  on  the  impact  of  financial  wealth  on  \nthe labor supply of older people, including the effects of inheritances, lottery wins, \nand  stock  markets  (e.g.,  Imbens,  Rubin,  and  Saerdote  2001;  Brown,  Coile,  and \nWeisbenner  2010;  Coronado  and  Perozek  2003).  Meanwhile,  studies  have \nprovided  strong  evidence  of  the  effect of  social  security, medical  care,  and  health \nfactors  on  the  labor  market  behavior  of  older  people  (e.g.,  Krueger  and  Pischke \n1992;  Blau  and  Gilleskie  2001;  Bound,  Stinebrickner,  and  Waidmann  2010;  Vere \n2011; French and Jones 2011).  \n\nIn developing countries, because of differences in pension systems and cultural norms, \nthe  explanations  are  quite  different.  One  of  the  main  factors  that  affect  labor  market \nparticipation  for  older  people  is  poverty  in  developing  countries.  Barrientos,  Gorman, \nand  Heslop  (2003)  found  a  high  level  of  old-age  poverty  in  developing  countries, \nincluding Thailand, due to the lack of accessibility to markets, public services (including \nhealthcare  and  education),  and  social  networks.  Households,  as  the  key  to  older \npeople\u2019s  support  in  developing  countries,  play  an  especially  important  role  in  low-\nincome and rural areas. Giles, Wang, and Cai (2011) suggested that unlike developed \ncountries, given the lack of pension support and the absence of a mandatory retirement \nage,  workers  in  the  informal  sector  in  developing  countries  expect  to  work  until  late  \nin  their  lives.  In  Latin  America,  the  working  hours  of  people  over  the  age  of  65  are \nsimilar  to  those  aged  50  to  59,  but  older  people  receive  much  less  payment  \n(Del Popolo 2001). Kaushal (2014) found that pensions have a relatively small negative \neffect on the employment of older people in India, in contrast to rich and middle-income \ncountries  that  documented  a  large  negative  effect.  Moreover,  most  older  people  in \ndeveloped  countries  do  not  live  with  their  adult  children,  but  co-residence  is  a \ntraditional norm in developing countries. Caregiving in the intergenerational family can \ngo both ways. On the one hand, an adult child may provide care for their parents. On \nthe  other  hand,  parents  also  help  with  the  housework  and  grandparenting.  Connelly, \nMaurer-Fazio,  and  Zhang  (2014)  used  the  Chinese  population  census  to  study  the \ndeterminants  of  the  labor  participation  of  older  people  and  found  that  co-residence \nreduces  the  labor  participation  of  older  people  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\n(PRC) rural areas but not in urban areas. However, because of data limitations, they do \nnot control for health status and pensions.  \n\nMany  studies  in  Thailand  have  addressed  the  concerns  over  the  aging  population,  \nbut  empirical  analysis  of  their  labor  supply  is  lacking,  and  studies  are  limited  by  \ntheir  cross-sectional  design.  Fujioka  and  Thangphet  (2009)  provided  a  descriptive \nanalysis  of  the  aging  population  in  Thailand  and  highlighted  the  significance  of  this \ngroup in the labor market. In addition, it has been suggested that the recent increase  \nin  older  people\u2019s  labor  participation  in  Thailand  may  be  due  to  their  improved  health \n(Fujioka  and  Thangphet  2009).  In  2002,  the  universal  health  coverage  scheme  was \nimplemented,  which  covered  those  in  the  informal  sector  who  had  not  previously \nbenefitted from the public health scheme. Using the 2007 Survey of Older Persons in \nThailand and the logit model, Adhikari, Soonthorndhada, and Haseen (2011) analyzed \nthe  factors  determining  the  LFP  of  elderly  Thai  individuals,  which  suggested  that \nwomen  living  with  children  and  those  with  poor  health  are  more  likely  to  withdraw  \nfrom  the  labor  force.  Keeratipongpaiboon  (2012)  estimated  the  determinants  of  \nolder  people\u2019s  employment  decisions  using  a  standard  probit  model  that  considers \nhousehold types, health, and pensions in Thailand. However, with the limitation of the \ncross-sectional data, their results suffer from estimation bias.  \n\nMore  recently,  Paweenawat  and  Vechbanyongratana  (2015)  studied  the  impact  of \nolder  people\u2019s  allowances  on  their  labor  participation using  the standard probit  model \nand  suggested  that  social  pensions  have  a  negative  impact  on  LFP  in  Thailand,  and \nthe  impact  is  higher  for  low-income  households.  Sadangharn  (2017)  investigated \nelderly  employment  in  the  Thai  automotive  industry  through  interviews,  which  drew \nattention to the recruitment method, health, pensions, and working conditions for older \nworkers.  A  recent  study  by  Wattanasaovaluk  (2020)  found  that  the  incidence  of \nexperienced  older  workers  returning  to  the  workforce  increased  with  their  skill  level.  \n|To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  one  has  provided  a  detailed  overview  of  the \nemployment  of  older  people  and  estimated  the  determinants  of  LFP  among  older \npeople, considering the effect of co-residence, health, and pensions, by exploring panel \ndata in Thailand. \n\n4.  OVERVIEW OF OLDER WORKERS IN THAILAND  \n\nUsing  the  Labor  Force  Survey  (LFS)  from  1985  to  2017,  we  provide  an  overview  of  \nthe  employment  of  older  people  in  the  Thai  labor  market,  including  the  LFP,  wages, \nworking  hours,  and  work  status.  Figure  1  shows  the  labor  force  participation  rate \n(LFPR) for older people for four age groups. Nearly 80% of the sample aged 55 to 59  \nin  the  LFS  is  in  the  labor  force.  After  the  official  retirement  age  of  60  is  reached  in  \nthe  public  sector,  over  57%  of  those  aged  between  60  and  64,  over  40%  of  those  \naged  65  to  69,  and  over  20%  of  those  aged  70  to  75  remain  in  the  labor  force.  The \nLFPR  increased  by  around  6%  for  each  of  the  age  groups  over  60  after  the  1997 \nfinancial crisis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nFigure 1: Labor Force Participation Rate for Older People  \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\nThis trend has been consistent with that  found in developed countries. In the US, the \nLFP  of  older  people  increased  significantly  from  1996,  from  17.5%  in  1996  to  26.8%  \nin  2016  (US  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics).  During  the  period  1990\u20132015,  an  average \nincrease  of  20%  in  the  rate  of  LFP  was  found  among  older  people  (55\u201364)  (Regina \n2018). Geppert et al. (2019) found that the labor participation of older people in almost \nall OECD countries has increased in the last two decades, mainly because of rising life \nexpectancy and improved education.  \n\nFigure 2: Labor Force Participation Rate of Older People by Education Levels  \n(%) \n\nThe  LFP  among  older  people  in  developing  countries  is  usually  higher  than  that  of \ndeveloped  countries  because  of  insufficient  income  security  and  social  welfare  in  the \nformer.  In  developing  countries,  especially  low-income  ones,  the  proportion  of  older \npeople in the labor market is very high, as they make a significant contribution to their \nhouseholds,  but  their  remuneration  decreases  as  they  age  (Barrientos,  Gorman,  and \nHeslop 2003). Thailand exhibits a higher rate of LFP among those aged over 60 than \ncertain other economies in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Indonesia, and Brunei \nDarussalam (Arifin and Anata 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nFigure 2 shows that the primary level has the highest labor force participation among \nolder  persons.  After  2000,  there  is  a  clear  gap  in  LFP  between  each  education  \nlevel,  which  may  suggest  that  less  educated  workers  tend  to  work  longer  to  support \nthemselves.  In  Figure  3,  we  separate  the  LFP  by  gender.  At  over  20%,  older  male \nparticipants have a much higher participation rate than women.  \n\nFigure 3: Labor Force Participation Rate of Older People by Gender  \n(%) \n\n \n\n5.  DATA \n\nIn  this  study,  we  used  two  data  sets,  both  from  surveys  conducted  by  the  National \nStatistical Office (NSO) of Thailand. To mitigate the issue of seasonal migration of the \nworkforce,  only  the  third  quarter  of  the  year  is  used  for  analysis  (Sussangkarn  and \nChalamwong 1996). The sample is restricted to individuals aged 55 to 75. We provide \nan  overview  of  the  trends  of  older  workers\u2019  labor  market  behavior  by  using  the  LFS \nfrom 1985 to 2017. While the LFS contains many observations and a long time span for \nthe  basic  analysis,  it  lacks  comprehensive  information  relating  to  the  labor  supply  of \nolder people, such as pensions and health status.  \n\nTherefore, to estimate the determinants of older people\u2019s labor force participation, we \nuse the 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, and 2012 waves of the SES on individuals aged 55 to \n75.  They  are  nationally  representative  panel  data,  containing  more  information  that \nwould affect the labor supply of older people than merely the LFS. Besides information \non individuals\u2019 health status, household type, and pension, the SES also asked about \nthe  sources  of  their  income  (\u201cDid  you  receive  money  in  cash  or  in  kind  from  the \nfollowing  sources?\u201d),  including  job  compensation,  monetary  assistance  from  other \npeople, and assistance from the government, which allows us to provide more insights \ninto labor force participation. \n\nTable 2 shows the summary statistics of the SES data. On average, 57% of the sample \nbetween  the  ages  of  55  and  75  participated  in  the  labor  force.  About  60.5%  of  the \nsample  lives  with  their  adult  children.  Most  older  people  obtained  only  primary-level \neducation  (78.1%),  and  only  3.5%  of  those  receive  a  pension.  Health  status  is \nmeasured  on  a  five-point  scale.  The  descriptive  details  of  the  variables  are  shown  \nin Table 3. \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nTable 2: Summary Statistics of SES 2005\u20122012 \n\nObservations  Mean \n0.577 \n0.035 \n2.744 \n0.605 \n63.538 \n \n\n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n \n\nMin \n0 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n55 \n \n\nMax \n1 \n1 \n5 \n1 \n75 \n \n\n \n\nLabor force participation \nPension \nHealth \nCo-residence \nAge \n\nEducation levels: \nPrimary level \nSecondary level \nUniversity level \nGender \nMarried \nUrban \n\nIncome source: \nJob compensation \nAssistance from other people \nAssistance from government \nIncome from house/land/asset lending \nIncome from interest/dividend/share/bond \n\nSpouse information: \nSpouse pension \nSpouse work \n\nStd \n0.494 \n0.183 \n0.777 \n0.489 \n6.075 \n \n\n0.413 \n0.287 \n0.334 \n0.497 \n0.447 \n0.479 \n \n\n0.050 \n0.476 \n0.453 \n0.198 \n0.287 \n \n\n0.195 \n0.492 \n\n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n \n\n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n10,406 \n \n\n6,317 \n6,317 \n\n0.781 \n0.091 \n0.128 \n0.448 \n0.725 \n0.355 \n \n\n0.002 \n0.348 \n0.288 \n0.041 \n0.090 \n \n\n0.040 \n0.591 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n\n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n \n\n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n \n\n1 \n1 \n\nVariable \nLFP \nPension \n\nHealth \nCo-residence \nAgegroup \n\nEdu \nGender \n\nMarital \nArea \nIncome_source \n\n \n \n \n \n \nSpouse pension \nSpouse work \n\nTable 3: Description of Variables  \n\nDescription \n\na dummy that equals 1 if individual i participates in labor force at time t \na dummy that equals 1 if individual receives pension \ncategorical variable that equals 1 if self-report health status is very good, 2 if good,  \n3 if fair, 4 if poor, 5 if very poor \na dummy that equals 1 if individual currently lives with their adult child \ngroup dummies of 55 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, and 70 to 75 \nthree education degree dummies, namely primary level, secondary level, and \nuniversity level \na dummy that equals 1 if individual is male \na dummy that equals 1 if individual is married, 0 includes single, widowed, divorced, \nor separated \na dummy that equals 1 if individual resides in urban area, 0 in rural area \nincludes five dummies: \nequals 1 if individual receives job compensation \nequals 1 if individual receives assistance from other people \nequals 1 if individual receives assistance from government \nequals 1 if individual receives income from house/land/asset lending \nequals 1 if individual receives income from interest/dividend/share/bond \na dummy that equals 1 if individual\u2019s spouse receives pension \na dummy that equals 1 if individual\u2019s spouse participates in labor force \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\n6.  DETERMINANTS OF OLDER PEOPLE\u2019S LABOR \n\nFORCE PARTICIPATION \n\n6.1  Methodology \n\nThe theory of older people\u2019s labor supply assumes that individuals maximize their utility \nsubject  to  a  budget  constraint,  which  is  related  to  their  health,  wealth,  and  other \nindividual or household characteristics (Giles, Wang, and Cai 2011; Connelly, Maurer-\nFazio, and Zhang 2014).  \n\nWe examine the determinants of older people\u2019s labor force participation by employing \nboth  a  standard  logit  model  and  a  fixed-effect  logit  model.  While  the  standard  logit \nmodel  provides  some  evidence  on  the  determinants  by  controlling  for  older  people\u2019s \nindividual  and  household  characteristics  that  reflect  their  preference  in  terms  of  labor \nforce  participation,  unobserved  heterogeneity,  such  as  ability,  may  still  bias  the \nestimation  results.  Therefore,  we  also  apply  the  fixed-effect  model  to  account  for \nadditional endogenous bias. \n\nWith the binary outcome of labor force participation, we first employ the standard logit \nmodel  to  estimate  the  determinants  of  labor  force  participation  for older  people  in  the \nform of \n\nLFP \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 =   \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd0 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd1Pension\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd2Health\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd3Co \u2212 residence\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd4Agegroup\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\n \n\n(1) \n\nLFPit\n\n+\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd5Edu\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd6Gender\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd7 Marital\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd8Area\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd9Income_source\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\n is an indicator that equals 1 if individual i participates in the labor force in \nwhere \nperiod t, and 0 otherwise. The model accounts for the availability of pensions, individual \nhealth  status,  co-residence  status  or  not,  education  levels,  gender,  marital  status, \nresidence  areas,  and  sources  of  income.  We  expect  that  without  pensions,  declining \nhealth and aging are negatively correlated with older people\u2019s labor force participation. \nWe also expect that co-residence status and residence areas will affect their decision \nto work.  \n\nBecause most older workers are in the informal sector, which does not report wages, \nwe do not include wages in the regression. However, we include education levels and \nincome  sources  as  proxies  for  their  wealth\nas  suggested  by  Giles,  Wang,  and  Cai \n(2011); education levels reflect the returns and accumulated wealth of elderly persons. \n\n \nTo correct for unobserved heterogeneity, we further employ the fixed-effect logit model \n(FE-logit). The probability that older people choose to work is as follows:  \n\n \n\n(2) \n\nPr (LFPit = 1|xit, \u03b3, \u03b1i) = \u039b(\u03b1i + xit\u03b3)\n\nxit\n\n is a set of covariates, which is the same as in Equation (1). \n\nwhere \n is the individual \nspecific  effects,  the  unobserved  heterogeneity  in  individual  preferences  for  labor  \nforce  participation,  which  is  allowed  to  be  correlated  with  the  regressors \n.  \n.  However,  we  have  lost  many  observations  under  fixed \neffects. 2 Furthermore,  as  the  LFP  of  older  people  may  be  affected  by  the  LFP  or \n\u039b(\u03b8) = exp(\u03b8) /[1 + exp(\u03b8)]\n\nxit\n\n\u03b1i\n\n \n\n2   The  random-effect  (RE-logit)  results  taking  account  of  unobserved  heterogeneity  that  assume  the \nregressors  are  completely  exogenous,  \u03b1i  is  distributed  independently  of  xit  (Verme,  Barry,  and \nGuennouni  2016),  are  also  presented  in  the  results.  The Hausman  test shows  strong  rejection  of the \nnull hypothesis that random effect provides consistent estimates.  \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\npension of their spouse, additional controls for spouse pension and spouse labor force \nparticipation with loss of observations are added as a robustness check.  \n\n6.2  Results \n\n6.2.1  Basic Analysis \n\nTable 4 presents the basic results of the standard logit model, fixed-effect logit model, \nand  random-effect  logit  model.  The  magnitudes  of  the  coefficients  under  each  model \nare quite different. After correction for potential endogeneity from the standard model, \nthe results show a smaller magnitude under a fixed-effect model, indicating an upward \nbias.  We  find  strong  evidence  that  age growth,  pension,  health  status,  marital  status, \njob  compensation, and  assistance  from other  people  have  a significant  impact on  the \nLFP of older people, with the findings being robust across the three models.  \n\nPensions and worse health status have a negative influence on LFP. After we control \nfor age, education, and other related individual characteristics, older people are 36.4% \nless likely to participate in the labor force if they receive pensions, and those with very \npoor health are 26.7% less likely to participate in the labor force than those with very \ngood health under the fixed-effect model. The negative effect of co-residence on LFP is \nnot  statistically  significant  under  the  fixed-effect  model.  Both  job  compensation  and \nassistance from other people have been shown to have a significantly negative impact \non  LFP:  job  compensation  reduces  the  probability  of  LFP  by  42.6%,  and  assistance \nfrom other people reduces it by 7.9%.  \n\nIn  Thailand,  informal  workers  have until  recently  received much  less  access  to  social \nsecurity  than  formal  and  government  employees.  Those  without  pensions  usually \noccupy a lower status with less education and wealth, and they tend to remain in the \nlabor  force  into  old  age  to  support  themselves.  Similar  results  have  been  found  in \nstudies  in  developing  countries  to  varying  extents.  For  example,  de  Carvalho  Filho \n(2008)  found  that  old-age  benefits  increased  the  retirement  rate  by  38%  in  Brazil,  \nwhile  Bloom  et  al.  (2008),  using  cross-country  data,  suggested  that  pensions  were \nassociated with a 5% reduction in LFP.  \n\nMany  of  the  informal  workers  are  in  the  agricultural  industry,  which  requires  brawn  \n(Mu  and  van  de  Walle  2011;  Rendall  2013).  Health  status  acts  as  a  leading  factor  \nin  older  people\u2019s  decision  to  work.  In  line  with  previous  empirical  studies  in  both \ndeveloped  and  developing  countries,  unhealthy  people  leave  the  labor  force  earlier \nthan  healthy  people  (e.g.,  McGarry  2004;  Kalwji  and  Vermeulen  2008).  A  decreased \nlevel of work strongly associated with health and age growth is also found in Thailand \n(Knodel  et  al.  2015).  Keeratipongpaiboon  (2012)  suggested  that  health  plays  a \nsignificant  role  in  older  people\u2019s  choice  to  work,  with  healthy  individuals  being  26.9% \nmore likely to work than unhealthy ones.  \n\nWe  next  run  a  regression  by  adding  controls  for  the  spouse\u2019s  pension  and  spouse\u2019s \nLFP.  For  those  with  spouses,  pensions  and  health  have  a  smaller  negative  effect  \nthan for the overall sample, but spouses\u2019 pensions and work do not show a significant \nimpact on LFP under the fixed-effect model. \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nTable 4: Determinants of Labor Force Participation of Older People  \n(Marginal Effects) \n\n \n\n \n\nHealth status (Base group: very good) \n\nPension \n \n\nGood \n \n\nFair \n \n\nPoor \n \n\nVery poor \n\n \n\nAge 60\u201264 \n \n\nAge 65\u201269 \n \n\nAge 70\u201275 \n\n \n\nSecondary level \n \n\nUniversity level \n \n\nGender \n \n\nMarried \n \n\nUrban \n \n\nCo-residence with adult children \n \n\nAge (Base group 55\u201259): \n\nEducation (Base group primary level): \n\nSource of income: \n\nJob compensation \n \n\nAssistance from other people \n \n\nAssistance from government \n \n\nHouse/land/asset lending \n \n\nInterest/dividend/share/bond \n\n \n\nSpouse pension \n \n\nSpouse work \n \n\nObservations \n\nWith Spouse Control \n\nRE Logit \n\u20133.519*** \n(0.307) \n\nFE Logit \n\u20130.170** \n(0.070) \n\nRE Logit \n\u20132.662*** \n(0.310) \n\n\u20130.657*** \n(0.191) \n\u20130.929*** \n(0.188) \n\u20131.832*** \n(0.210) \n\u20132.497*** \n(0.467) \n\u20130.910*** \n(0.104) \n\n\u20131.200*** \n(0.112) \n\u20132.408*** \n(0.134) \n\u20133.516*** \n(0.155) \n\n\u20130.471*** \n(0.177) \n\u20130.305** \n(0.140) \n1.837*** \n(0.125) \n0.802*** \n(0.120) \n\u20130.803*** \n(0.112) \n \n\n\u20132.757*** \n(0.818) \n\u20130.688*** \n(0.087) \n\u20130.00692 \n(0.085) \n\u20130.538*** \n(0.195) \n0.496*** \n(0.145) \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n10,406 \n\n\u20130.0673** \n(0.029) \n\u20130.0815*** \n(0.028) \n\u20130.135*** \n(0.031) \n\u20130.124*** \n(0.044) \n\u20130.0249 \n(0.020) \n\n\u20130.0520** \n(0.023) \n\u20130.0863*** \n(0.031) \n\u20130.101*** \n(0.036) \n\n\u20130.0244 \n(0.028) \n0.0136 \n(0.029) \n\u20130.989 \n(42.820) \n0.0393 \n(0.042) \n0.00458 \n(0.027) \n \n\n\u20130.0815 \n(0.109) \n\u20130.0402*** \n(0.015) \n\u20130.0469*** \n(0.017) \n\u20130.0109 \n(0.028) \n0.00474 \n(0.021) \n0.016 \n(0.038) \n\u20130.00916 \n(0.010) \n1,851 \n\n\u20130.564*** \n(0.216) \n\u20130.741*** \n(0.211) \n\u20131.689*** \n(0.233) \n\u20132.061*** \n(0.460) \n\u20130.698*** \n(0.102) \n\n\u20130.633*** \n(0.121) \n\u20131.509*** \n(0.137) \n\u20132.100*** \n(0.156) \n\n\u20130.478*** \n(0.169) \n\u20130.350** \n(0.139) \n1.603*** \n(0.109) \n0.167 \n(0.139) \n\u20130.429*** \n(0.102) \n \n\n\u20132.734*** \n(1.061) \n\u20130.579*** \n(0.094) \n0.146 \n(0.097) \n\u20130.562*** \n(0.217) \n0.385** \n(0.155) \n0.143 \n(0.266) \n2.102*** \n(0.089) \n6,317 \n\nLogit \n\u20130.410*** \n(0.027) \n\n\u20130.0775*** \n(0.020) \n\u20130.124*** \n(0.020) \n\u20130.262*** \n(0.022) \n\u20130.358*** \n(0.052) \n\u20130.124*** \n(0.009) \n\nOverall \n\nFE Logit \n\u20130.364*** \n(0.099) \n\n\u20130.129*** \n(0.039) \n\u20130.160*** \n(0.037) \n\u20130.238*** \n(0.044) \n\u20130.267*** \n(0.069) \n\u20130.0303 \n(0.027) \n\n\u20130.130*** \n(0.012) \n\u20130.281*** \n(0.013) \n\u20130.420*** \n(0.013) \n\n\u20130.0820*** \n(0.028) \n\u20130.139*** \n(0.039) \n\u20130.185*** \n(0.051) \n\n\u20130.0605*** \n(0.016) \n\u20130.0383*** \n(0.013) \n0.186*** \n(0.009) \n0.0687*** \n(0.010) \n\u20130.0944*** \n(0.009) \n \n\n\u20130.317*** \n(0.094) \n\u20130.0896*** \n(0.009) \n0.0141 \n(0.010) \n\u20130.103*** \n(0.021) \n0.0735*** \n(0.016) \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n10,406 \n\n\u20130.0691 \n(0.042) \n\u20130.0107 \n(0.034) \n0.142 \n(0.247) \n0.110** \n(0.048) \n\u20130.0244 \n(0.044) \n \n\n\u20130.426** \n(0.170) \n\u20130.0794*** \n(0.021) \n\u20130.101*** \n(0.026) \n\u20130.0175 \n(0.038) \n0.0262 \n(0.029) \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n3,444 \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\n6.2.2   Subgroup Analysis \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nWhile the marginal effects from Table 4 reflect the effect of each determinant of LFP, it \nis  possible  that  the  results  are  driven  by  the  composition  of  the  sample  that  has  not \nbeen adequately controlled in the estimation. Therefore, we separated the analysis of \nLFP  behavior  by  subgroups,  including  gender,  residence  area,  and  age  and  lower \neducation  level.  Table  5  shows  the  results  for  men  and  women.  Pension  and  health \nstatus negatively affected women\u2019s LFP more than men\u2019s. Under the fixed-effect logit \nmodel,  men  who  are  eligible  for  pensions  are  21.5%  less  likely  to  participate  in  the \nlabor force than those who are not, while women with pensions are 35.3% less likely to \ndo so than those without pensions.  \n\nUnder the traditional norm, women are expected to take care of household chores and \nchild  care,  suggesting  that  they  are  more  likely  to  leave  the  labor  market  than  men \n(Johnson  and LoSasso  2006;  Maurer-Fazio  et  al.  2011).  As shown  in  Figure  3,  more \nolder men participate in the labor force than older women, and the gender gap in LFP \nis  stable  over  time.  According  to  the  NSO  (2005),  there  is  a  large  gender  gap  in  the \nshare of those who engage in household work among those over 60: 21.8% of women \nand only 1.9% of men.  \n\nTable 6 shows the results for rural and urban areas. In rural areas, older people usually \nearn  less  over  their  lifetimes  and  have  less  access  to  pensions  than  those  in  urban \nareas (Ravallion and Chen 2007). Health status has a greater impact on older people \nin rural areas than in urban areas, as rural work may require more physical skills than \nurban work. In Thailand, the percentage of working elderly persons is much higher in \nrural than in urban areas regardless of year, indicating a higher work tendency among \nolder people in agriculture (Knodel et al. 2015). Pension status affects urban residents \nmore than rural residents, suggesting that even though older people receive pensions, \nthose in urban areas are more likely to leave the labor market than those in rural areas.  \n\nInterestingly,  the  significantly  negative  impact  of  co-residence  is  evident  in  the  rural \nsample but not in the urban area. Similarly, Connelly, Maurer-Fazio, and Zhang (2014) \nfound  that  co-residence  has  a  large  and  significantly  negative  impact  on  the  LFP  of \nolder people in Chinese rural areas but not in urban areas. The main source of income \nfor older people in Thailand is support from their working children, especially for poor \nand informal workers without social security. Those who live with their children usually \nhave  a  lower  likelihood  of  participating  in  the  labor  force  as  they  may  provide  child  \ncare or share housework with their children. Monetary transfers from adult children to \ntheir  parents  are  partly  given  in  exchange  for  child  care  services  (Park  2014).  Liao  \nand  Paweenawat  (2020)  suggested  that  intergenerational  co-residence  increased  the \nmaternal  labor  supply  because  of  grandparents\u2019  assistance  in  child  care  in  Thailand. \nThe lack of social security in rural areas also explains why older people depend more \non  their  children  and  are  less  likely  to  leave  the  labor  market  with  greater  financial \nneeds.  In  addition,  the  health  status  of  older  people  and  co-residence  with  adult \nchildren may be correlated. Poor health may be a good indicator that may increase the \nprobability of co-residence and lower the LFP of older people. According to Knodel and \nChayovan (2011), Thai parents who are not in good health much prefer to receive care \nfrom, and live with, their children.  \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nTable 5: Comparison of Determinants of Labor Force Participation  \nof Older People by Gender (Marginal Effects) \n\nMen \n\nWomen \n\n \n \n\nRE logit \n\u20133.983*** \n(0.402) \n\n\u20130.349 \n(0.285) \n\u20130.794*** \n(0.281) \n\u20131.782*** \n(0.325) \n\u20133.214*** \n(0.762) \n\u20130.538*** \n(0.178) \n \n\n\u20131.974*** \n(0.223) \n\u20133.381*** \n(0.255) \n\u20134.405*** \n(0.282) \n\n\u20130.41 \n(0.259) \n\u20130.542** \n(0.262) \n1.309*** \n(0.247) \n\u20131.019*** \n(0.194) \n\n\u20136.059*** \n(1.314) \n\u20130.888*** \n(0.154) \n\u20130.151 \n(0.143) \n\u20130.314 \n(0.304) \n0.273 \n(0.233) \n4,660 \n\nFE logit \n\u20130.353** \n(0.143) \n\n\u20130.156*** \n(0.050) \n\u20130.177*** \n(0.048) \n\u20130.244*** \n(0.046) \n\u20130.231*** \n(0.086) \n\u20130.0425 \n(0.030) \n \n\n\u20130.0293 \n(0.030) \n\u20130.0858** \n(0.041) \n\u20130.140*** \n(0.049) \n\n\u20130.0623 \n(0.051) \n\u20130.025 \n(0.035) \n0.0925* \n(0.052) \n\u20130.0102 \n(0.048) \n\n0.0169 \n(0.166) \n\u20130.0548*** \n(0.020) \n\u20130.0730*** \n(0.026) \n\u20130.0655 \n(0.051) \n0.0564 \n(0.036) \n2,140 \n\nRE logit \n\u20132.596*** \n(0.566) \n\n\u20130.889*** \n(0.263) \n\u20131.042*** \n(0.259) \n\u20131.916*** \n(0.283) \n\u20131.956*** \n(0.604) \n\u20131.183*** \n(0.130) \n \n\n\u20130.908*** \n(0.132) \n\u20131.997*** \n(0.163) \n\u20133.109*** \n(0.193) \n\n\u20130.628** \n(0.263) \n\u20130.234 \n(0.165) \n0.642*** \n(0.135) \n\u20130.700*** \n(0.140) \n\n\u20130.00296 \n(0.966) \n\u20130.611*** \n(0.107) \n0.0299 \n(0.107) \n\u20130.698*** \n(0.261) \n0.630*** \n(0.188) \n5,746 \n\nHealth status (Base group: very good) \n\nPension \n \n\nGood \n \n\nFair \n \n\nPoor \n \n\nVery poor \n\n \n\nAge 60\u201264 \n \n\nAge 65\u201269 \n \n\nAge 70\u201275 \n\n \n\nSecondary level \n \n\nUniversity level \n \n\nMarried \n \n\nUrban \n \n\nSource of income: \n\nJob compensation \n \n\nCo-residence with adult children \n \n\nAge (Base group 55\u201259): \n\nEducation (Base group primary level): \n\nAssistance from other people \n \n\nAssistance from government \n \n\nHouse/land/asset lending \n \n\nInterest/dividend/share/bond \n\nObservations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFE logit \n\u20130.215** \n(0.100) \n\n\u20130.0449 \n(0.037) \n\u20130.0740** \n(0.037) \n\u20130.125*** \n(0.044) \n\u20130.157*** \n(0.058) \n\u20130.0106 \n(0.027) \n \n\n\u20130.184*** \n(0.059) \n\u20130.199*** \n(0.066) \n\u20130.204*** \n(0.071) \n\n\u20130.0392 \n(0.036) \n0.0151 \n(0.046) \n0.0703 \n(0.061) \n\u20130.066 \n(0.050) \n\n\u20131.772 \n(69.630) \n\u20130.0737** \n(0.029) \n\u20130.0943** \n(0.040) \n0.0142 \n(0.034) \n\u20130.0262 \n(0.030) \n1,298 \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nTable 7: Determinants of Labor Force Participation of Older Workers over Age 60 \nand Lower Education (Marginal Effects) \n\nHealth status (Base group: very good) \n\n \n\n \n\nPension \n \n\nGood \n \n\nFair \n \n\nPoor \n \n\nVery poor \n\n \n\nGender \n \n\nMarried \n \n\nCo-residence with adult children \n \n\nSource of income: \n\nJob compensation \n \n\nAssistance from other people \n \n\nAssistance from government \n \n\nHouse/land/asset lending \n \n\nInterest/dividend/share/bond \n\n \n\nObservations \n\nOver 60 \n\nOver 60 and Primary Level \n\nRE Logit \n\u20133.295*** \n(0.364) \n\n \n\nFE Logit \n0.11 \n(0.185) \n\n \n\nRE Logit \n\u20131.771*** \n(0.664) \n\n \n\n\u20130.705*** \n(0.227) \n\u20131.026*** \n(0.224) \n\u20131.912*** \n(0.248) \n\u20132.555*** \n(0.547) \n\u20131.070*** \n(0.126) \n1.502*** \n(0.152) \n1.017*** \n(0.143) \n \n\n\u20130.988 \n(0.941) \n\u20130.770*** \n(0.103) \n\u20130.471*** \n(0.092) \n\u20130.471** \n(0.230) \n0.456*** \n(0.176) \n6,965 \n\n\u20130.104* \n(0.056) \n\u20130.153*** \n(0.058) \n\u20130.202*** \n(0.069) \n\u20130.254** \n(0.105) \n\u20130.0702* \n(0.040) \n0.0503 \n(0.290) \n0.0674 \n(0.060) \n \n\n\u20130.266 \n(0.272) \n\u20130.109*** \n(0.042) \n\u20130.138*** \n(0.049) \n0.0284 \n(0.051) \n0.0538 \n(0.047) \n1,757 \n\n\u20130.664** \n(0.262) \n\u20131.089*** \n(0.258) \n\u20132.012*** \n(0.285) \n\u20132.423*** \n(0.593) \n\u20131.158*** \n(0.142) \n1.518*** \n(0.168) \n1.124*** \n(0.160) \n \n\n\u20131.318 \n(1.317) \n\u20130.934*** \n(0.116) \n\u20130.444*** \n(0.104) \n\u20130.451* \n(0.256) \n0.675*** \n(0.212) \n5,446 \n\nGiven  that  the  mandatory  retirement  age  for  workers  in  the  public  sector  is  60  in \nThailand (Labor Protection Act), Table 7 provides the results for people aged over 60 \nand those who have primary-level education. Those who only have primary education \nare more likely to be poor and participate in the labor force to earn a living. Similarly,  \nas suggested by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA 2017), poorer older Thai \npeople  aged  over  60  are  more  likely  to  work  than  wealthier  ones,  indicating  that  \nthose elderly persons are more likely to remain in the labor force out of obligation than \nout of choice.  \n\nThe  results  show  that  the  impact  of  pensions  is  negatively  significant  for  those  aged \nover  60  but  not  for  the  primary  level.  Not  only  does  a  very  small  proportion  of  older \npeople of low economic status receive pensions, but even if they do, it may still not be \nenough  to  live  off.  Therefore,  their  labor  force  decisions  have  not  been  affected  by \npensions but rather by their health status and co-residence status, which may indicate \nthe inadequacy of government support for the poor. According to SOPT (2014), older \npeople  who  reported  the  government  allowance  as  their  primary  source  of  income  \nwere  more  likely  to  say  that  their  income  was  inadequate,  while  those  who  reported \n\nFE Logit \n\u20130.223* \n(0.121) \n\n\u20130.135*** \n(0.051) \n\u20130.157*** \n(0.054) \n\u20130.214*** \n(0.069) \n\u20130.289*** \n(0.111) \n\u20130.0683* \n(0.036) \n0.0248 \n(0.280) \n0.093 \n(0.058) \n \n\n\u20130.188 \n(0.184) \n\u20130.0844** \n(0.034) \n\u20130.134*** \n(0.048) \n0.00275 \n(0.044) \n0.02 \n(0.035) \n2,347 \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nemployment or their children as their primary sources of income were much less likely \nto feel that their income was inadequate.

We first present the trends of the labor market behavior of older people \nby using the LFS from 1985 to 2017. Then, we rely on SES panel data from the period \n2005  to  2012  to  estimate  the  determinants  of  older  people\u2019s  labor  force  participation. \nOur estimates imply that older people with pensions and worse health status are less \nlikely to work. Women\u2019s LFP is more affected by pension and health status than men\u2019s. \nPension  status  has  less  impact  on  those  living  in  rural  areas  than  on  those  living  \nin  urban  areas,  while  it  is  not  significant  for  those  with  lower  education.  The  results \nunderscore that older people of lower economic status, especially those in the informal \nsector, may suffer from inadequate government support, which makes them remain in \nthe labor market to earn a living. Furthermore, older people\u2019s LFP is negatively affected \nby  co-residence,  which  suggests  that  the  lack  of  public  support  and  other  social \nassistance tends to lead them to depend more on their children. \n\nThailand, as well as other UN members, adopted the Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs) in 2015, which include among their objectives improving the well-being of old \npeople.  While  notable  progress  has  been  made,  further  improvement  is  still  required. \nCompared to developed countries, where most workers are covered by social security, \nincluding pensions, health insurance, and other benefits, in developing countries, social \nsecurity usually covers workers in the formal sector with a large proportion of the labor \nforce uncovered (Giles, Wang, and Cai 2011). In developed countries, over 90% of the \nlabor force has access to the pension system, in which the provision of voluntary and \nmandatory  pension  programs  is  well  structured  and  funded  (Dethier  2007).  In  OECD \ncountries, different methods have been applied to ensure that older people can satisfy \na  minimal  living  standard.  For  example,  the  UK  and  Australia  use  a  means-tested \npublic scheme, while the US has an earnings-related scheme (Dethier 2007). Because \nof various obstacles in developing countries, such as fiscal and structural constraints, it \nis difficult to apply these models from developed countries directly to developing ones. \n\nOn  the  basis  of  our  analysis  in  this  study,  we  highlight  several  issues  related  to \nemployment  among  Thailand\u2019s  aging  population.  First,  our  results  suggest  a  strong \nassociation between pensions and the labor supply of elderly persons. A high share of \nolder  workers  in  rural  areas  is  likely  to show  the  \u201cceaseless  toil\u201d  of  rural  older  people \n(Davis-Friedman 1991), which raises concern about the insufficiency of social pensions \nfor older people, especially in the informal sector and rural areas.  \n\nThe Thai government has taken steps to help increase older people\u2019s income in recent \nyears,  such  as  through  the  Older  Persons  Act  (2003),  the  implementation  of  the  Old \nAge Allowance (2009), and the National Savings Fund (2015). However, except for the \nuniversal program, all other pension programs available for informal workers are on a \nvoluntary  basis.  The  benefit  level  of  allowances  is  low  and  hardly  has  a  significant \nimpact  on  older  workers  (Paweenawat  and  Vechbanyongratana  2015).  Similarly,  the \nvoluntary  social  program  in  pillar  three  remains  undersubscribed  (NSF  2017). In  fact, \nthe  majority  of  older  people  in  the  informal  sector  still  cannot  afford  to  join  those \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nprograms.  Until  the  end  of  2017,  the  National  Savings  Fund  had  only  approximately \n546,000  members  (NSF  2017).  Although  it  is  too  early  to  assess  the  impact  of  the \nprogram, preliminary evidence in Thailand and past evidence from other countries with \nsimilar programs have shown that it primarily helped wealthier persons in the informal \nsector (World Bank 2012).  \n\nThe  government  should  give  more  attention  to  increasing  its  pension  coverage  and \nbenefits  to  address  older  people\u2019s  income  insecurity.  The  universal  allowance  for  \nolder  people  should  relate  to  the  national  subsistence  level  and  the  poverty  line.  \nAs  suggested  by  Knodel  and  Teerawichitchainan  (2017),  \u201ccivil  social  networks  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  can  support  the  expansion  of  the  National  Savings \nFund.\u201d  The  implementation  of  voluntary  social  programs  should  be  facilitated,  which \nrequires expanded effort among workers in the informal sector. The government needs \nto provide more incentives to encourage working-age people to participate in voluntary \nprograms, in which, through savings, they can obtain a higher income as they age. In \naddition to social programs, given the high poverty rate among the elderly (World Bank \n2012),  supplementing  older  people\u2019s  income  through  public  programs  is  encouraged. \nFor  example,  it  has  been  suggested  that  study  programs  and/or  community  activities \nshould be made available to improve their skills and raise their income for sustainable \ndevelopment. \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1224 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nPaweenawat and Liao \n\nAbeliansky, A.L., E.

Thailand\u2019s aging society \nfaces many challenges. This is particularly so for older Thai people who still have to work for \na  living  due  to  insufficient  savings.  This  paper  first  provides  an  overview  of  the  basic \nchanges related to the labor force participation (LFP) of older people using the Labor Force \nSurvey (LFS) from 1985 to 2017. Then, this study uses Socio-Economic Survey (SES) panel \ndata  from  2005  to  2012  and  employs  the  fixed-effect  logit  model  (FE-logit)  to  estimate  the \ndeterminants of older people\u2019s LFP. Our main findings provide strong evidence that pensions \nand  poorer  health  status  reduce  the  LFP  of  older  people  in  Thailand.  Furthermore,  while \nhealth  status  is  significant  across  all  analyses,  pensions  have  less  impact  on  lower-status \nworkers,  indicating  that  even  if  they  receive a  pension,  they  may still  be  too  poor  to  retire. \nFinally, co-residence decreases the LFP only of older people in rural areas. Those who are \nolder, with a primary education, and who are usually employed in the informal sector suffer \nfrom poverty and require more assistance from others.  \n \nKeywords: population aging, older worker, elderly labor supply, Thailand \n \nJEL Classification: J21, J22, J14, O17, O53 \n \n", " \n"]}
