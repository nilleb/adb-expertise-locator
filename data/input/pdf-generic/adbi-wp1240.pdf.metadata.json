The Western and North-Western provincial coasts of  \nSri Lanka are economically significant and have a highly dynamic nature. This study used \nsatellite images from the Google Earth platform to analyze the changes occurring in the \ncoastal zone during the period between 2005 and 2019 on the Western and North-Western \nprovincial coasts of Sri Lanka. The results revealed that the average coastal erosion rates \nare \u20131.21\u00b10.04 m yr-1 in Kalutara, \u20130.54\u00b10.63 m yr-1 in Colombo, and \u20130.7\u00b10.58 m yr-1 in \nGampaha district. Puttalam district showed a 0.26\u00b10.07 m yr-1 average accretion rate, while \nthe highest accretion rate (0.95 \u00b1 0.58 m yr-1) was evident in the coastal region of Wilpattu \nNational Park, an area that has few anthropogenic interventions. The application of hard \nstructures to mitigate the effect of coastal erosion has increased within the past 15 years. At \nthe end of 2019, the country mainly used revetments up to 23,554 m in length (occupying \n9.05% of the total study area), consisting of 18,960 m in the Western province (7.29%) and \n4,594 m in the North-Western province (1.76%). The Western province has applied more \nhard structures at a higher rate than the North-Western province due to mega-development \nprojects. Overall, anthropogenic activities are affecting coastal erosion in that area more \nthan natural or global scenarios, and the applied hard structures have little capability to \ncontrol erosion.  \n \nKeywords: coastal hard structures, erosion, accretion, anthropogenic impacts, shoreline  \n \nJEL Classification: Q20, Q53, Q57 \n \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K.

INTRODUCTION \nSorenson and McCreary (Clark 1995) defined a coastal zone, or a coastal area, as the \ntransition or interface region where \u201cpart of the land is affected by its proximity to the \nsea and where part of the ocean is affected by its proximity to the land.\u201d The Coast \nConservation Act of 1981 defined the coastal zone of Sri Lanka as follows:  \n\u2026 the area lying within a limit of 300m landward of the mean high-water level \nand a limit of 2 km seaward of the mean low water level. In the case of rivers, \nstreams, lagoons, or any other body of water connected to the sea either \npermanently or periodically the landward boundary extends to a limit of 2 km \nmeasured perpendicular to the straight base line drawn between the natural \nentrance points thereof and shall include the waters of such rivers, streams, \nand lagoons or any other body of water so connected to the sea.  \nIt is a complex series of interlinked physical systems that involve both offshore and \nonshore processes (Prasad and Kumar 2014). \nIn fact, coastal zones are very important due to their abundant natural resources  \nand wide variety of interconnected ecosystems, such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, \nmangroves, sand dunes, coastal vegetation, lagoons, estuaries, and coastal wetlands \n(Clark 1995; Alesheikh, Ghorbanali, and Nouri 2007). As Sri Lanka is a small island, \nthe coastal zone is a remarkable landscape that plays a vital role in the country\u2019s \neconomy.  The  development  activities  covering  the  fisheries  sector,  tourism  and \ntransport, and logistic development provide unlimited benefits to the coastal dwellers \nover  a  wide  area.  Therefore,  most  countries  distinguish  their  coastal  zone  as  a  \nkey element of their economy and culture (Clark 1995; Beatley, Brower, and Schwab \n2002).  \nResearch has identified coastal erosion and temporal shoreline changes as a major \nnational-level problem in this developing country since the early 1980s (Perera 1990; \nGodage 1992). The temporal shoreline changes resulting from natural phenomena like \ncoastal floods, storm surges, hurricanes, tsunamis, sea-level rises, and tidal variations \ncould cause coastal erosion (Zhang, Douglas, and Leatherman 2004; Prasetya 2006; \nNayak 2017). Research has found that coastal longshore currents, coastal rip currents, \nwaves,  and  wind  activities,  transporting  sand  from  the  shore  and  depositing  it \nsomewhere else, are influential factors for coastal erosion (Senevirathna et al. 2018). \nIn addition, amplified anthropogenic activities, such as disturbing coral reefs, sand \nmining,  deforesting  coastal  vegetation,  and  artificial  alteration  through  dredging,  \nfilling, and construction, are leading issues that produce coastal erosion (Clark 1995; \nVan  Rijn  2011;  Prasad  and  Kumar  2014).  Coastal  erosion  directly  and  indirectly \ncreates environmental issues, reduces economic growth, and generates social conflicts \n(Hanson and Lindh 1993; Ndour et al. 2018; Williams, Rangel-Buitrago, Pranzini, and \nAnfuso 2018).  \nResearchers  identified  coastal  erosion  as  a  major  problem a  long  time  ago. The \nmechanisms of coastal erosion are not fully understood, and researchers have not fully \ninvestigated  the  effect  of  coastal  protective  structures.  As  a  developing  country,  \nSri Lanka has implemented various types of coastal protective methods. The major \ntechniques that it has used to protect its coastal areas are soft coastal protection \ntechniques (beach nourishment and dune construction) and hard coastal protection \ntechniques  (revetments,  groynes,  offshore  breakwaters,  gabion  walls,  coves,  and \nimmediate rock beddings), which allow the shore to behave naturally without any \nconstructive protection method (declared as a restricted area) (Dias, Ferreira, Matias, \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n \nVila-Concejo, and S\u00e1-Pires 2003; Iskander 2010; Borsje et al. 2011). However, a new \ninclination  toward  eco-friendly,  soft,  and  state-of-the-art  methods  rather  than  hard \nconstructions is observable (Hegde 2010). Due to the prevailing economic state of the \ncountry, it has implemented low-cost coastal protective structures, and research has \nnot yet fully studied their effectiveness and their negative impacts on the coastal zone \nof Sri Lanka.  \nOn the other hand, the monitoring of coastal zones is a significant task in sustainable \ndevelopment and environmental protection due to their highly dynamic nature; they are \ncontinually changing due to the interaction between the oceans and the land (Harley, \nTurner, Short, and Ranasinghe 2011; \u0141abuz 2015) and various anthropogenic impacts \n(Dias, Ferreira, Matias, Vila-Concejo, and S\u00e1-Pires 2013; Pessoa and Lidon 2013). \nTherefore, conducting regular monitoring of the coastal environment is very important \nto  ascertain  the environmental,  social, and economic  vulnerabilities  in  the coastal \nregions.  \nFurthermore, several major economic activities take place in the coastal zone, like \ntourism,  fisheries,  fishery  harbors,  commercial  harbors,  and  development  projects, \nsuch as power generation projects, and approximately 70% of tourist hotels and nearly \n62%  of  industrial  units  contribute  to  the  national  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \n(Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) 2004). Furthermore, the rapid development \nof infrastructures has occurred with the high densification of inhabitants along the \ncoastal zone within the past decades (Senevirathna, Edirisooriya, Uluwaduge, and \nWijerathna 2018).  \nThe  geographical  information  system  (GIS)  and  remote  sensing  (RS)  technology  \nare among the dominant tools for quantifying the changes in the coastal zone with \nshoreline change as they provide information in digital form (Zuzek, Nairn, and Thieme \n2003). In addition, researchers have identified GIS and remote sensing techniques \nusing  high-resolution  satellite  images  as  one  of  the  best  solutions  to  investigate \nshoreline  changes  over  a  long  period  of  time  as  they  are  efficient  and  effective  \nand have access to temporal data (Warnasuriya, Gunaalan, and Gunasekara 2018). \nThe high-resolution satellite images from the Google Earth (GE) platform are freely \navailable, so they are cost-effective and can enable the mapping of changes in a \ncoastal zone after the appropriate corrections. The major advantages of using GE \nsatellite images are the availability of both medium- and high-resolution images and the \navailability of time series data (Malarvizhi, Kumar, and Porchelvan 2016).  \nRecent studies have revealed that the erosion of the coastal zone of Sri Lanka is a \nlong-standing problem (Lakmali et al. 2017; Ratnayake et al. 2018, 2019) but has poor \nmonitoring and documentation. Other than that, studies on shoreline changes have \nbeen very limited in the Western and North-Western provinces. \nThe Western coastal area (Kalutara, Colombo, and Gampaha districts) of Sri Lanka \nhas a highly concentrated population, development activities, and infrastructures and \nindustries, including the capital city of Colombo, with mass development projects that \nwill increase the coastal erosion of their particular area. The North-Western province\u2019s \ncoastal zone includes only the Puttalam district, which covers the Willpattu National \nPark. Its status as a restricted area that belongs to the national park fully inhibits \nanthropogenic interventions.  \nThe  current  study  selected  the  Western  coastal  area  (Kalutara,  Colombo,  and \nGampaha districts)\u2014Zone A\u2014and the North-Western coastal area (Puttalam)\u2014Zone \nB\u2014to study the temporal shoreline changes over a 15-year (2005\u20132019) time period. \nTo  determine  the  effectiveness  of  the  applied  coastal  protective  structures  and  \nthe effect of the physical alteration due to anthropogenic interventions and natural \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K.

MATERIALS AND METHODS \n2.1  Study Area \nThe  coastlines  of  three  administrative  districts,  specifically  Kalutara  (42.3  km), \nColombo  (24.3  km),  and  Gampaha  (34.7  km),  belong  to  the  Western  province \n(Zone A), while only the coastline of Puttalam district (159 km) belongs to the North-\nWestern province (Zone B). The study area extends approximately 260 km in the \ncoastal zone from the Bentota River (Western province), Kalutara, to the Modaragam-\naru River, Puttalam (North-Western province). This area Lies between the Benthota \nRiver, at the Southern End of Kalutara (6.5854\u00b0 N, 79.9607\u00b0 E), and the Modaragam-\naru River, at the Northern End of Puttalam (8.0408\u00b0 N, 79.8394\u00b0 E).  \nThe study area experiences a typical maritime climate with an average temperature of \n27 \u00b0C on the western and north-western coasts. The mean annual rainfall varies from \nless than 900 mm in the driest parts (North-Western province) to over 5,000 mm in  \nthe  wettest  parts  (Western  province)  (Schott  and  McCreary  2001;  Tomczak  and \nGodfrey 2013; Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka 2019). The rainfall pattern varies \nseasonally with the monsoon system. The prevailing changes in the weather are due to \nthe  south-western  monsoon  (May  to  September)  (Ranathunge  et  al.  2003).  The \nchanges in the sediment transport flux, river discharge, and wave climate are totally \ndependent on the monsoon pattern, and it directly influences the temporal coastal \nchanges. The area faces numerous natural hazards, such as coastal erosion, stream \nflooding,  storm  and  tidal  surges,  and  active  surface  faulting.  The  anthropogenic \ninterventions include sand mining, coral mining, coastal development, inappropriate \nremoval of coastal vegetation, and direct pollution as well as temporal coastal changes. \nThe  Wilpattu  National  Park,  a  protected  area,  completely  covers  Zone  B,  which \nrepresents the Wilpattu region (from Dutch Bay to Modaragam-Aru\u201426 km). Because \nof that, there are no interventions from humans. The topography of the beach area \nincludes rocky cliffs, dunes, and the main beach area, for which coastal vegetation \nforms a boundary. The rocky cliffs, dunes, and coastal vegetation act as barriers as \nwell as natural protectors of the coast (Tien and Sam 2007). \nThe  categorization  of  the  considered  topographical  changes  includes  temporal \nshoreline  change,  applied  coastal  constructions  (protective  barriers/hard  protection \ntechniques), and coastal developments through physical alteration of the shoreline in \neach district, Kalutara, Colombo, and Gampaha (Zone A) and Puttalam (Zone B). \n2.2  Data Collection and Data Processing \nThe  study  used  high-resolution  satellite  images  to  extract  shorelines  through  the \ndigitization of multi-date satellite images to form the shape files. It extracted the coastal \nconstructions/alterations  (e.g.,  harbors,  artificial  coastal  islands,  etc.)  and  coastal \nprotective structures (revetments, groynes, breakwaters, and coves) throughout the  \n15-year period from 2005 to 2019 by using the Google Earth Pro 7.3 software package.  \nThe study detected the temporal shoreline positions and physical alterations, including \nthe coastal constructions/alterations and coastal protection structures, through both \nvisual interpretation and manual declination using the Google Earth Pro 7.3 software \npackage.  It  incorporated  satellite  images,  community-based  interviews,  previous \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n \nconstruction data from the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management \nDepartment  of  Sri  Lanka  (CC  and  CRMD),  and  published  documents  wherever \nnecessary for validation.  \n2.2.1  Extraction of the Shoreline \nThe  study  considered  the  borderline  between  land  and  water  as  the  shoreline, \nreferencing the blue margin that splits the land from the water in satellite images via \nvisual  interpretation  (Warnasuriya,  Gunaalan, and  Gunasekara 2018;  Warnasuriya, \nKumara, Gunasekara, Gunaalan, and Jayathilaka 2020). The wave action within the \nselected season of the years (October, November, December) was comparatively low \nbecause there was no direct influence of the inter-monsoon (October\u2013November) and \nnorth-east monsoon (December\u2013February) on the study area (Schott and McCreary \n2001; Gunaratna et al. 2011; Tomczak and Godfrey 2013; Thevasiyani and Perera \n2014; Bamunawala et al. 2015). \nTable 1: Approximate Spatial Resolution of the High-Resolution Satellite  \nImages from the Google Earth Platform \nDate  Approximate Spatial Resolution (m) \nDec. 2005  0.31\u20131.84 \nDec. 2010  0.31\u20131.84 \nNov. 2015  0.31\u20131.84 \nDec. 2019  0.31\u20131.84 \nNote: The study used data sources and visual interpretation of GE images by distinguishing the minimum possible \nidentifiable objects to determine the approximate spatial resolution.  \nGround truth investigation obtained ground control points (GCPs) in places; physical \nshoreline  alteration  with  protective  structures  affected  shoreline  positions  and \npermanent structures (harbors and buildings) and adjusted ecosystems (sand dunes \nand  vegetation).  The  ground  survey  obtained  GCP  locations  using  the  Garmin \nGPSMAP 64s Global Positioning System (GPS).  \nIn the shoreline extraction, the tilt of the images of the study area, the scale, and the \neye altitude (300 m) remained similar for each image throughout the process to remove \nthe errors arising during digitization due to the zoom level (Warnasuriya, Kumara, \nGunasekara,  Gunaalan,  and  Jayathilaka  2020). The  authors  saved  the  digitized \nshorelines in Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file format and converted the KML files \ninto  \u201clayer  files\u201d  using  the  ArcGIS  10.6  software.  They  projected  all  the  digitized \nshorelines to the WGS 1984 UTM 44N projection system.  \n2.2.2  Shoreline Rectification \nThe authors checked the accuracy of the satellite images using 15 GCPs and applied \ngeometric  corrections  to  each  shoreline  before  conducting  the  analysis  process \n(Figure 1). They estimated slight shifts of GE satellite images due to geo-referencing \nerrors and platform-oriented errors with reference to the GCPs in the satellite image of \n2011, which was closely related to the ground truth data (Warnasuriya, Gunaalan, and \nGunasekara 2018). These authors considered permanent structures, such as the roof \ntips of square-shaped buildings, as GCPs in all the satellite images of different years. \n   \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K.

After appending, \nthey created buffer polygons with 100 m width for each shoreline and merged the \nbuffer polygons to create the baseline. They managed all these activities in a specific \npersonal  geodatabase  using  the  ArcGIS  10.6  software.  They  created  two  feature \nclasses to represent the shoreline and baseline in the same geodatabase and used the \nappended shoreline dataset to create a shoreline feature class; they then used the \ncreated buffer polygon to create a baseline feature class with specific attributes.  \nThe study used the standard deviation of the positional shift as the initial uncertainty \n(U1)  and  considered  the  tidal  influence  as  the  second  uncertainty  (U2)  to  detect \nshoreline changes. The average tidal variation on the western coast of Sri Lanka is \n0.2\u20130.3m (Wijeratne and Pattiaratchi 2006). Then, the authors calculated the tidal \ninfluence on the shoreline: \nTan\u019f =   \nAverage Tide Variation (m)\nShoreline Displacement (m)\nwhere \u019f is the average slope angle (Warnasuriya, Gunaalan, and Gunasekara 2018). \nThey calculated the cumulative uncertainty for each shoreline using \nU = U1 + U2 \nU\u2014cumulative uncertainty \nU1\u2014uncertainty due to positional shift (m) \nU2\u2014uncertainty due to tidal influence (m) \nThey used the DSAS version 5.0 tool in the ArcGIS software to calculate the shoreline \nchange statistics. They added the date field and uncertainty field to each shoreline \nlayer  and  entered  the  data  into  the  respective  attribute  tables  (for  shoreline \nrectification).  Then,  they  created  the  \u201ctransect  layer\u201d  by  casting  transects  in  5  m \nintervals along the baseline, allowing the transects to cross all the shorelines.  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K.

The NSM revealed the overall \nshoreline change based on the shoreline position during the 15-year period. \nThe authors derived the end point rate (EPR) by dividing the distance of the shoreline \nmovement by the time elapsed between the oldest and the youngest shoreline position \n(Oyedotun  2014).

These structures \nprovided a temporary solution to coastal erosion by preventing the degradation of the \nbeach (Pranzini and Williams 2013). According to Silva et al. (2014), hard protection \nstructures are the main coastal management strategy to mitigate the effect of coastal \nerosion in Latin American countries, in European countries, and on the Caribbean \ncoast of Colombia. \nHowever, this is not a sustainable solution because the structures tend to move the \nerosion along the coastal zone due to the effect of longshore sediment transport \n(Rangel-Buitrago,  Williams,  and  Anfuso  2018).  When  considering  the  Kalutara, \nColombo, and Gampaha districts in the Western province, Colombo applied more hard \ntechniques along the coastal zone than the other two districts (Table 8). Since the \nmajority  of  them  are  revetments  and  breakwaters  of  the  Port  City  project  and \nColombo\u2019s commercial harbor, they may cause an increasing erosion rate in the other \ntwo districts due to the effect of longshore sediment transportation and seasonal winds. \nFurthermore, the application of hard structures has negatively affected the coastal \nscenery, and many beaches with high tourism potential now have little scenic value. \nThe negative visual impacts are the result of the environmental degradation associated \nwith the construction of hard protection structures and the collection of coastal debris \n(Williams and Micallef 2011; Rangel-Buitrago, Correa, Anfuso, Ergin, and Williams \n2013; Williams et al. 2018) \nThe Puttalam district (within the Wilpattu region) shows accretion and few influences of \nanthropogenic activities, like the Western province, and the Wilpattu region behaves \nnaturally, so it tends to maintain a stable environment rather than suffering from high \nerosion or accretion. \n3.1.2  Percentage of Erosion and Accretion in Each Selected Area  \nAs  Figure  7  represented,  erosion  has  strongly  influenced  the  highest  percentage \n(75.55%)  of  shorelines  in  the  Kalutara  district  (approximately  three-fourths  of  the \nKalutara coast suffered erosion) and the Wilpattu region recorded the smallest area  \nof erosion, with a high accretion percentage (93.46%) of the shoreline.

In the estuary (Kaluganga \nestuary), the freshwater output of Kaluganga has washed away all the sandbars and \neroded a vast area of the beach in Kalutara North (Calido beach, Kalutara). According \nto the ground truth investigation, this is a result of the rough seas due to the south-west \nmonsoon in the last few years. \nThe study found that there is an unstable coastal zone all along the Colombo coast, but \nthe Mount Lavenia and Wellawatta beaches showed moderate erosion. The coast, \nincluding Dehiwala, Mount Lavenia, and Wellawatta beaches, in the Colombo district \nshowed severe seasonal erosion, mainly during the southwest monsoon (Lakmali et al. \n2017). According to that study, the erosion along the coast including Dehiwala, Mount \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n \nLavenia, and Wellawatta beach is not a permanent feature. The effect of erosion varies \nonly seasonally and accretion occurs with the onset of the fair-weather north-eastern \nmonsoon. Colombo, as the capital of Sri Lanka, has experienced strong anthropogenic \ninterventions  and  alterations  of  the  coastal  zone  due  to  the  expansion  and \ndevelopment of the city. Port City, combined with the Colombo south harbor project, \nwas the major development activity causing physical alterations of the shoreline in \nColombo. Within the past few years, it may have caused the highest erosion and \naccretion rates around Port City. The coastal area of Colombo has adopted many hard \nprotection techniques (Table 8), so the observed erosion along most of the Colombo \ncoast is not permanent. Lakmali et al. (2017) reported that the seasonal changes \nrecover and accretion occurs after the rough season. Therefore, there is a stable \ncondition  or  dynamic  equilibrium  in  the  present  day  and  no  long-term  erosion  is \nobservable. \nAccording to the results represented, there is also a considerably stable beach all \naround the Gampaha coast. The past data recorded that the erosion has affected the \nUswatakeiyawa and Negombo coastal areas of Gampaha district moderately. Even \nthough the areas have already introduced coastal protection techniques, erosion is still \napparent here. The community in the area and the responsible fishery associations  \nof Sri Lanka have accused the construction of the Port City project of causing this \naggravated  erosion.  However,  according  to  the  data  that  the  Marine Environment \nProtection  Authority  (MEPA)  and  the  Coast  Conservation  and  Coastal  Resource \nManagement Department (CC and CRMD) collected, there is no scientific proof of the \neffect of the Port City on coastal erosion (Gunawansa 2018). Nevertheless, according \nto Beaven et al. (2018), landfills are a major issue in shoreline management planning \n(SMP), which aims to manage the risks associated with flooding and coastal erosion.  \nFigure 9: Near-Shore Sediment Transportation Directions \n \nSource: Long-term coastal erosion and shoreline positions of Sri Lanka (Lakmali et al. 2017). \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n \nIn addition, the sediment deposition pattern associated with breakwaters and groynes \nin the entire area shows sand transportation predominantly toward the north (Figure 9). \nAccording  to  Lakmali  et  al.  (2017),  sediment  deposition  in  the  northern  section \ncharacterizes  the  south-western  coastal  area,  whereas  erosion  characterizes  the \nsouthern  section,  implying  predominant  sediment  transportation  toward  the  north. \nTherefore,  the  south-western  monsoon  winds,  which  power  the  northerly-directed \nlongshore transport, predominantly governs the south-western coastal belt. \nWhen  comparing  the  topographical  characteristics  of  each  site  that  recorded  the \nlargest erosion changes and largest accretion changes, it became apparent that most \nof  the  sites  have  a  significant  feature  that  causes  their  shoreline  behavior.  The \nKaluwamodara region, which has the highest EPR in the Kalutara district, is adjacent to \nthe Bentota River estuary. Here, the washed particles from the inner land can form \ndeposits around the estuary, causing accretion changes in the area. The Mount Lavinia \nsite with a low EPR in Colombo district and the Dikowita site in Gampaha, which also \nhas a low EPR, have adjoined hard structures. Furthermore, the Dikowita site is very \nnear  to  the  Dikowita  harbors.  Sandy  beaches  completely  cover  the  Kudawa  and \nKandakuliya sites. Due to the minimum human interventions in this region, the behavior \nof wind, waves, and longshore currents tend to move sand from one place to another. \nFinally, these areas have faced instant shoreline changes. \n3.2  Application of Coastal Protective Constructions \nThe  main  hard  coastal  protective  constructions  that  this  study  considered  are \nrevetments, breakwaters, coves, and groynes. \nFigure 10: Categorized Hard Structures in the Study Area: (A) Revetments,  \n(B) Breakwaters, (C) Coves, and (D) Groynes \nA  B \n   \nC  D \n   \nSource: Breakwaters and cove images from GE imagery. \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n \nIn  the  current  study,  areas  have  mainly  implemented  revetments  as  a  coastal \nprotective structure up to 23,554 m length (9.05%), covering 18,960 m in the Western \nprovince and 4,594 m in the North-Western province. The revetment is in the land ward \nmargin of the boundary between the sea and the land, and the parallel structure \nreduces the wave action using solid durable structures, such as granite boulders. \nAreas have commonly used revetments to protect soft landforms, dunes, and coastal \nslopes to provide additional protection to address the erosion hazards. The protective \neffect of a revetment depends on the coastal area that implements it.  \nThe extents of the coastal revetment in Kalutara, Colombo, Gampaha, and Puttalam \ndistricts were approximately 7,133 m, 9,432 m, 2,395 m, and 4,594 m, and their \ncoverage percentages of the total coastal length were 16.85%, 38.81%, 6.90%, and \n2.88%,  respectively.  The  high  net  erosion  rate  that  the  Kalutara  district  recorded \ncaused the implementation of a considerable extent of coastal revetments.  \nThe total constructed lengths of breakwaters in the above districts, respectively, were \n1,903 m, 702 m, 2,175 m, and 4,141 m. The total numbers of groynes in those districts \nwere 19, 2, 29, and 91, respectively. According to the results, there were three coves  \nin Kalutara, no coves in Colombo and Gampaha, and two coves in Puttalam at the end \nof 2019. \nTable 8: Total Hard Structures in Kalutara, Colombo, Gampaha,  \nand Puttalam Districts \nKalutara  Colombo \nYear  BW (m)  Rvts (m)  Groynes  Coves  Year  BW (m)  Rvts (m)  Groynes  Coves \n2005  1,125.4  3,494.5  12  3  2005  1,045.1  8,804.7  1   \n2009  1,198.1  3,515  10  3  2009  725.4  9,373  3   \n2014  1,256.9  4,944.1  10  3  2014  493.6  10,401.2  2   \n2019  1,902.9  7,132.7  19  3  2019  701.9  9,432.3  2   \nGampaha  Puttalam \nYear  BW (m)  Rvts (m)  Groynes  Coves  Year  BW (m)  Rvts (m)  Groynes  Coves \n2005  1,911.3  2,924.4  20  1  2005  463.4  4,517.3  19  2 \n2009  1,674.6  3,505.6  24    2009  469.8  4,492  19  2 \n2014  1,784.5  2,921.3  25    2014  2,944.5  4,746.6  36  2 \n2019  2,175  2,394.5  29    2019  4,151.3  4,593.5  91  2 \nAt the end of 2019, Puttalam district specifically, on the Kalpitiya peninsular, applied a \nvast amount of different hard structures: revetments and groynes. The unconsecrated \nsand layer around the Kalpitiya peninsular has suffered from a high erosion rate. \nIn 2005, the greatest application of hard structures took place within Colombo district. \nHowever, the Port City development project caused this application to decrease from \n2014 to 2019 because of the removal of the hard structures around the region that \ncovered the Port City in Colombo and the damage to the revetments in certain places.  \nFurthermore, other districts have gradually increased the application of hard structures \nover  time.  According  to  Figure  6,  Kalutara  and  Gampaha  have  average  erosion  \nrates, so they have applied hard structures as precautions. In the Puttalam district, \nthere is an average accretion rate, but Puttalam has implemented a huge number  \nof hard structures to prevent adverse changes to the shoreline in certain regions. As  \nan example, the region from Maha-oya estuary, Wennappuwa, Marawila, to Chilaw \n(7\u00b016\u02b942.39\u02baN,  79\u00b050\u02b927.75\u02baE\u20137\u00b03\u02b94.83\u02baN,  79\u00b047\u02b924.85\u02baE)  applied  an  enormous \namount of protective structures with a groyne series consisting of 38 individual groynes \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n \nand  a  series  of  breakwaters  with  revetments  (Rathnayakage  et  al.  2020).  When \ncomparing the applied hard structures in each district, all four districts have used \nrevetments extensively while using coves minimally.  \nAnon (1997) mentioned the length of the existing effective shoreline protection works in \n1996 for revetments and groynes as follows. When comparing this with the data for \n2019, it showed that there was greater application of coastal structures in 1996 than in \n2019 (revetments). The reduction of structures may be due to the destruction occurring \nover time, removal due to developments, disappearance, or due to the beach filling \nfollowing accretion and the tsunami phenomenon in 2004.  \nTable 9: Data Comparison of Applied Hard Structures in 1996 and 2019 \nCoastal Region  Total Length (m) 1996  Total Length (m) 2019 \nRevetments  5,633  11,827 \nWest Coast (Gampaha, Colombo) \nGroynes  2,135  6,309 \nWest Coast (Gampaha, Colombo) \nSource: Anon (1997) (Coastal Area Management in Sri Lanka). \nAccording  to  the  National  Action  Plan  for  Protection  of  Marine  and  Coastal \nEnvironment from Land-Based Activities (1999), revetments provide protection to the \nlength of the coastline that they cover, and their cost-effectiveness is greater than that \nof other hard structures. \nFigure 11 proves that the Western province has implemented a larger amount of \ncoastal protection techniques to conserve the coastal zone than the North-Western \nprovince. This conservation method is based entirely on utilization, humans\u2019 alterations \nof the shoreline, and the adverse effects of natural phenomena. The Western province \n(Colombo,  Kalutara,  and  Gampaha)  has  utilized  its  coastal  zone  more  to  for \ndevelopment projects, the tourism industry, residences, infrastructure, and so on than \nthe North-Western province. To some extent, there has been minimal human influence \nalong the North-Western province\u2019s shoreline, so there is a naturally behaving sandy \nbeach up to Kalpitiya peninsula. \nFigure 11: Total Hard Structures in the North-Western and Western Provinces \n \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K.

When considering the shoreline changes within \nthe  selected  site,  it  is  possible  to  categorize  them  into  the  rates  of  low  erosion  \n(\u20131.0<EPR\u2264\u20130.5), stable condition (\u20130.5<EPR\u22640.5), low accretion (0.5<EPR\u22641.0), and \noccasionally high accretion around the selected hard structure. The NSM also shows \nlow erosional movements and accretion movements at the site. The shoreline change \nvariability (SCE) represents more accretional movements than erosional movements. \nWhen comparing the shoreline change rates of groynes, breakwaters, and revetments \nwithin the site, it is apparent that there are only stable and accretion rates around the \nbreakwaters and there are accretion shoreline movements other than around groynes \nand revetments.  \nAll  the  EPR  changes  adjacent  to  the selected site  (1  km)  and  5 km  away have  \nlow  erosion  (\u20131.0<EPR\u2264\u20130.5),  stable condition  (\u20130.5<EPR\u22640.5),  and  low  accretion \n(0.5<EPR\u22641.0) rates, with moderate and high erosion occurring rarely.

There  are  five  main  harbors  and  a  landfilling  area  that \ndeveloped from altering the shoreline in the study area. The Colombo harbor, the \nfishery harbor in Colombo, and the Beruwala fishery harbors have existed from the \nearly 2000s up to the present in the Western province. From 2009 to 2011, a small \nharbor was located in Pothupitiya, Kalutara. The governing body selected this area as \na suitable coastal stretch, extending over a 72,000 m2 area, for siting the temporary \nquarry rock loadout point (LoP) for the transshipment of rock to Colombo. It has \nfinished the construction of a temporary breakwater extending over 500 m and a \nseafront wall and has been undertaking the dredging of the basin since October 2008 \n(Lee et al. 2010). It established the Dikowita fishery harbor and Colombo south harbor \nin  2010  and  a  huge  area  incrementation  in  Colombo  south  harbor  by  2019  by \nexpanding the wave breaks to protect the harbor. Furthermore, the mass artificial \nlandfilling project \u201cPort City\u201d commenced in 2015 and has now expanded over 269 ha \nas an additional part of Sri Lanka in Colombo district. \nFigure 12: Coastal Development by Physical Alteration of the Shoreline  \nwithin the Past 20 Years \n \nThis graph shows the increase in areas of coastal developments from 2000 to 2019. \nFinally, this study has helped to prove that all these human influences or anthropogenic \ninterventions have caused shoreline changes directly or indirectly in this study area. In \naddition, there is an effect of natural phenomena, like tidal variations, sea-level rises, \nstorm surges, and so on. These two causes are interconnected. If highly adverse \nactivities occur around the coastal zone, they cause adverse behaviors of the sea, and \nthe aggravated behaviors of the sea tend to increase the human influence on the \ncoastal zone. Therefore, it is important to study the dynamic nature of the shoreline \nwith respect to wind patterns, current patterns, sea-level rises, and natural barriers, \nwhich help to protect the coastal zone. \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n \n4.  CONCLUSIONS  \nThe findings highlighted that the part of the study area experiencing coastal erosion \ndue to anthropogenic activities may face more drastic changes in its shoreline and \nenvironment than other areas in the Western and North-Western regions of Sri Lanka. \nTherefore, anthropogenic activities are the leading factor in coastal erosion in the \nrespective study area rather than natural scenarios such as a sea-level rise, climatic \nchanges, and natural disaster conditions. The application of hard structures is the \nsolution that is least able to control coastal erosion in a large area because applying \nhard  structure  is  good  for  the  site  but  not  very  helpful  for  other  adjacent  areas. \nTherefore, as long as humans introduce no alterations, the environment will remain \nunder its natural conditions. If the shoreline is changing naturally, as humans, we have \nto adjust rather than alter it. Furthermore, proper identification of the dynamic nature of \nthe  shoreline  that  is  occurring  due  to the  behavior  of  wave  patterns  and  coastal \ncurrents, obligatory subsidies for the conservation and management of the coastal \nzone, buffering capacity from natural coastal ecosystems, and coastal-based industries \nare very important. This study may provide information regarding where and when ad \nhoc coastal zone development projects and ad hoc soft and hard coastal conservation \nprograms will work effectively within the coastal zone. \n4.1  Limitations of the Study \nThe  authors  based  this  study  on  the  analysis  of  GIS  and  remote  sensing  data. \nBasically, the digitization relied on visual interpretations, and errors can occur in the \nfinal  results  if  the  remotely  sensed  data  do  not  undergo  correct  preprocessing. \nInsufficient previous data and studies regarding shoreline changes in this area were \navailable to carry out a comparative study. \n4.2  Recommendations for Future Research \nThis  research  mainly  focused  on  the shoreline changes and  the effect  of  human \ninfluences  and  natural  phenomena  on  the  Western  and  North-Western  provinces\u2019 \ncoasts. Further study could identify the changes along the whole coastline of Sri Lanka \nand establish a proper mechanism to define the predictability and the dynamic nature \nof the shoreline and the effect of a sea-level rise, the current patterns, and the wind \npatterns on the shoreline. The findings of further studies can assist in revising the \ncoastal management plan to ensure effective management approaches. \n   \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1240  L.C.K.

The western and northwestern provincial coasts of Sri Lanka are economically significant and have a highly dynamic nature. We use satellite images from the Google Earth platform to analyze the changes occurring in the coastal zone during the period between 2005 and 2019 on the western and northwestern provincial coasts of Sri Lanka. The results revealed that the average coastal erosion rates are \u20131.21\u00b10.04 m yr-1 in Kalutara, \u20130.54\u00b10.63 m yr-1 in Colombo, and \u20130.7\u00b10.58 m yr-1 in Gampaha district. Puttalam district showed a 0.26\u00b10.07 m yr-1 average accretion rate, while the highest accretion rate (0.95 \u00b1 0.58 m yr-1) was evident in the coastal region of Wilpattu National Park, an area that has few anthropogenic interventions. The application of hard structures to mitigate the effect of coastal erosion has increased within the past 15 years. At the end of 2019, the country mainly used revetments up to 23,554 m in length (occupying 9.05% of the total study area), consisting of 18,960 m in the Western province (7.29%) and 4,594 m in the North-Western province (1.76%). The Western province has applied more hard structures at a higher rate than the North-Western province due to mega-development projects. Overall, anthropogenic activities are affecting coastal erosion in that area more than natural or global scenarios, and the applied hard structures have little capability to control erosion.", "Title": "Are Coastal Protective Hard Structures Still Applicable with Respect to Shoreline Changes in Sri Lanka?"}}
