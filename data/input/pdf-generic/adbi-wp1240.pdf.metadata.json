INTRODUCTION \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nSorenson and McCreary (Clark 1995) defined a coastal zone, or a coastal area, as the \ntransition or interface region where \u201cpart of the land is affected by its proximity to the \nsea  and  where  part  of  the  ocean  is  affected  by  its  proximity  to  the  land.\u201d  The  Coast \nConservation Act of 1981 defined the coastal zone of Sri Lanka as follows:  \n\n\u2026 the area lying within a limit of 300m landward of the mean high-water level \nand a limit of 2 km seaward of the mean low water level. In the case of rivers, \nstreams,  lagoons,  or  any  other  body  of  water  connected  to  the  sea  either \npermanently  or  periodically  the  landward  boundary  extends  to  a  limit  of  2  km \nmeasured  perpendicular  to  the  straight  base  line  drawn  between  the  natural \nentrance  points  thereof  and  shall  include  the  waters  of  such  rivers,  streams, \nand lagoons or any other body of water so connected to the sea.  \n\nIt  is  a  complex  series  of  interlinked  physical  systems  that  involve  both  offshore  and \nonshore processes (Prasad and Kumar 2014). \n\nIn  fact,  coastal  zones  are  very  important  due  to  their  abundant  natural  resources  \nand  wide  variety  of  interconnected  ecosystems,  such  as  coral  reefs,  seagrass  beds, \nmangroves, sand dunes, coastal vegetation, lagoons, estuaries, and coastal wetlands \n(Clark  1995;  Alesheikh,  Ghorbanali,  and  Nouri  2007).  As  Sri  Lanka  is  a  small  island, \nthe  coastal  zone  is  a  remarkable  landscape  that  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  country\u2019s \neconomy.  The  development  activities  covering  the  fisheries  sector,  tourism  and \ntransport,  and  logistic  development  provide  unlimited  benefits  to  the  coastal  dwellers \nover  a  wide  area.  Therefore,  most  countries  distinguish  their  coastal  zone  as  a  \nkey element  of  their  economy and  culture  (Clark  1995;  Beatley,  Brower,  and  Schwab \n2002).  \n\nResearch  has  identified  coastal  erosion  and  temporal  shoreline  changes  as  a  major \nnational-level  problem  in  this  developing  country since  the  early 1980s  (Perera  1990; \nGodage 1992). The temporal shoreline changes resulting from natural phenomena like \ncoastal floods, storm surges, hurricanes, tsunamis, sea-level rises, and tidal variations \ncould  cause  coastal  erosion  (Zhang,  Douglas,  and  Leatherman  2004;  Prasetya 2006; \nNayak 2017). Research has found that coastal longshore currents, coastal rip currents, \nwaves,  and  wind  activities,  transporting  sand  from  the  shore  and  depositing  it \nsomewhere else, are influential factors for coastal erosion (Senevirathna et al. 2018). \nIn  addition,  amplified  anthropogenic  activities,  such  as  disturbing  coral  reefs,  sand \nmining,  deforesting  coastal  vegetation,  and  artificial  alteration  through  dredging,  \nfilling,  and  construction,  are  leading  issues  that  produce  coastal  erosion  (Clark  1995; \nVan  Rijn  2011;  Prasad  and  Kumar  2014).  Coastal  erosion  directly  and  indirectly \ncreates environmental issues, reduces economic growth, and generates social conflicts \n(Hanson and Lindh 1993; Ndour et al. 2018; Williams, Rangel-Buitrago, Pranzini, and \nAnfuso 2018).  \n\nResearchers  identified  coastal  erosion  as  a  major  problem  a  long  time  ago.  The \nmechanisms of coastal erosion are not fully understood, and researchers have not fully \ninvestigated  the  effect  of  coastal  protective  structures.  As  a  developing  country,  \nSri  Lanka  has  implemented  various  types  of  coastal  protective  methods.  The  major \ntechniques  that  it  has  used  to  protect  its  coastal  areas  are  soft  coastal  protection \ntechniques  (beach  nourishment  and  dune  construction)  and  hard  coastal  protection \ntechniques  (revetments,  groynes,  offshore  breakwaters,  gabion  walls,  coves,  and \nimmediate  rock  beddings),  which  allow  the  shore  to  behave  naturally  without  any \nconstructive protection method (declared as a restricted area) (Dias, Ferreira, Matias, \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nVila-Concejo, and S\u00e1-Pires 2003; Iskander 2010; Borsje et al. 2011). However, a new \ninclination  toward  eco-friendly,  soft,  and  state-of-the-art  methods  rather  than  hard \nconstructions is observable (Hegde 2010). Due to the prevailing economic state of the \ncountry,  it  has  implemented  low-cost  coastal  protective  structures,  and  research  has \nnot yet fully studied their effectiveness and their negative impacts on the coastal zone \nof Sri Lanka.  \n\nOn the other hand, the monitoring of coastal zones is a significant task in sustainable \ndevelopment and environmental protection due to their highly dynamic nature; they are \ncontinually changing due to the interaction between the oceans and the land (Harley, \nTurner, Short, and Ranasinghe 2011; \u0141abuz 2015) and various anthropogenic impacts \n(Dias,  Ferreira,  Matias,  Vila-Concejo,  and  S\u00e1-Pires  2013;  Pessoa  and  Lidon  2013). \nTherefore, conducting regular monitoring of  the coastal environment is very important \nto  ascertain  the  environmental,  social,  and  economic  vulnerabilities  in  the  coastal \nregions.  \n\nFurthermore,  several  major  economic  activities  take  place  in  the  coastal  zone,  like \ntourism,  fisheries,  fishery  harbors,  commercial  harbors,  and  development  projects, \nsuch as power generation projects, and approximately 70% of tourist hotels and nearly \n62%  of  industrial  units  contribute  to  the  national  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \n(Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) 2004). Furthermore, the rapid development \nof  infrastructures  has  occurred  with  the  high  densification  of  inhabitants  along  the \ncoastal  zone  within  the  past  decades  (Senevirathna,  Edirisooriya,  Uluwaduge,  and \nWijerathna 2018).  \n\nThe  geographical  information  system  (GIS)  and  remote  sensing  (RS)  technology  \nare  among  the  dominant  tools  for  quantifying  the  changes  in  the  coastal  zone  with \nshoreline change as they provide information in digital form (Zuzek, Nairn, and Thieme \n2003).  In  addition,  researchers  have  identified  GIS  and  remote  sensing  techniques \nusing  high-resolution  satellite  images  as  one  of  the  best  solutions  to  investigate \nshoreline  changes  over  a  long  period  of  time  as  they  are  efficient  and  effective  \nand  have  access  to  temporal  data  (Warnasuriya,  Gunaalan,  and  Gunasekara  2018). \nThe  high-resolution  satellite  images  from  the  Google  Earth  (GE)  platform  are  freely \navailable,  so  they  are  cost-effective  and  can  enable  the  mapping  of  changes  in  a \ncoastal  zone  after  the  appropriate  corrections.  The  major  advantages  of  using  GE \nsatellite images are the availability of both medium- and high-resolution images and the \navailability of time series data (Malarvizhi, Kumar, and Porchelvan 2016).  \n\nRecent  studies  have  revealed  that  the  erosion  of  the  coastal  zone  of  Sri  Lanka  is  a \nlong-standing problem (Lakmali et al. 2017; Ratnayake et al. 2018, 2019) but has poor \nmonitoring  and  documentation.  Other  than  that,  studies  on  shoreline  changes  have \nbeen very limited in the Western and North-Western provinces. \n\nThe  Western  coastal  area  (Kalutara,  Colombo,  and  Gampaha  districts)  of  Sri  Lanka \nhas  a  highly  concentrated  population,  development  activities,  and  infrastructures  and \nindustries,  including  the  capital  city of  Colombo,  with  mass  development  projects  that \nwill increase the coastal erosion of their particular area. The North-Western province\u2019s \ncoastal  zone  includes  only  the  Puttalam  district,  which  covers  the  Willpattu  National \nPark.  Its  status  as  a  restricted  area  that  belongs  to  the  national  park  fully  inhibits \nanthropogenic interventions.  \n\nThe  current  study  selected  the  Western  coastal  area  (Kalutara,  Colombo,  and \nGampaha  districts)\u2014Zone  A\u2014and  the  North-Western  coastal  area  (Puttalam)\u2014Zone \nB\u2014to study the temporal shoreline changes over a 15-year (2005\u20132019) time period. \nTo  determine  the  effectiveness  of  the  applied  coastal  protective  structures  and  \nthe  effect  of  the  physical  alteration  due  to  anthropogenic  interventions  and  natural \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nphenomena, it investigated the shoreline changes over the 15-year period by utilizing \nGIS and remote sensing techniques.  \n\n2.  MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1  Study Area \n\nThe  coastlines  of  three  administrative  districts,  specifically  Kalutara  (42.3  km), \nColombo  (24.3  km),  and  Gampaha  (34.7  km),  belong  to  the  Western  province \n(Zone A),  while  only  the  coastline  of  Puttalam  district  (159  km)  belongs  to  the  North-\nWestern  province  (Zone  B).  The  study  area  extends  approximately  260  km  in  the \ncoastal zone from the Bentota River (Western province), Kalutara, to the Modaragam-\naru  River,  Puttalam  (North-Western  province).  This  area  Lies  between  the  Benthota \nRiver, at the Southern End of Kalutara (6.5854\u00b0 N, 79.9607\u00b0 E), and the Modaragam-\naru River, at the Northern End of Puttalam (8.0408\u00b0 N, 79.8394\u00b0 E).  \n\nThe study area experiences a typical maritime climate with an average temperature of \n27 \u00b0C on the western and north-western coasts. The mean annual rainfall varies from \nless  than  900  mm  in  the  driest  parts  (North-Western  province)  to  over  5,000  mm  in  \nthe  wettest  parts  (Western  province)  (Schott  and  McCreary  2001;  Tomczak  and \nGodfrey 2013; Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka 2019). The rainfall pattern varies \nseasonally with the monsoon system. The prevailing changes in the weather are due to \nthe  south-western  monsoon  (May  to  September)  (Ranathunge  et  al.  2003).  The \nchanges  in  the  sediment  transport  flux,  river  discharge,  and  wave  climate  are  totally \ndependent  on  the  monsoon  pattern,  and  it  directly  influences  the  temporal  coastal \nchanges.  The  area  faces numerous  natural  hazards,  such  as  coastal  erosion,  stream \nflooding,  storm  and  tidal  surges,  and  active  surface  faulting.  The  anthropogenic \ninterventions  include  sand  mining,  coral  mining,  coastal  development,  inappropriate \nremoval of coastal vegetation, and direct pollution as well as temporal coastal changes. \nThe  Wilpattu  National  Park,  a  protected  area,  completely  covers  Zone  B,  which \nrepresents the Wilpattu region (from Dutch Bay to Modaragam-Aru\u201426 km). Because \nof  that,  there  are  no  interventions  from  humans.  The  topography  of  the  beach  area \nincludes  rocky  cliffs,  dunes,  and  the  main  beach  area,  for  which  coastal  vegetation \nforms  a  boundary.  The  rocky  cliffs,  dunes,  and  coastal  vegetation  act  as  barriers  as \nwell as natural protectors of the coast (Tien and Sam 2007). \n\nThe  categorization  of  the  considered  topographical  changes  includes  temporal \nshoreline  change,  applied  coastal  constructions  (protective  barriers/hard  protection \ntechniques),  and  coastal  developments  through  physical  alteration  of  the  shoreline  in \neach district, Kalutara, Colombo, and Gampaha (Zone A) and Puttalam (Zone B). \n\n2.2  Data Collection and Data Processing \n\nThe  study  used  high-resolution  satellite  images  to  extract  shorelines  through  the \ndigitization of multi-date satellite images to form the shape files. It extracted the coastal \nconstructions/alterations  (e.g.,  harbors,  artificial  coastal  islands,  etc.)  and  coastal \nprotective  structures  (revetments,  groynes,  breakwaters,  and  coves)  throughout  the  \n15-year period from 2005 to 2019 by using the Google Earth Pro 7.3 software package.  \n\nThe study detected the temporal shoreline positions and physical alterations, including \nthe  coastal  constructions/alterations  and  coastal  protection  structures,  through  both \nvisual  interpretation  and  manual  declination  using  the  Google  Earth  Pro  7.3  software \npackage.  It  incorporated  satellite  images,  community-based  interviews,  previous \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nconstruction  data  from  the  Coast  Conservation  and  Coastal  Resource  Management \nDepartment  of  Sri  Lanka  (CC  and  CRMD),  and  published  documents  wherever \nnecessary for validation.  \n\n2.2.1   Extraction of the Shoreline \n\nThe  study  considered  the  borderline  between  land  and  water  as  the  shoreline, \nreferencing  the  blue  margin  that  splits  the  land  from  the  water  in  satellite  images  via \nvisual  interpretation  (Warnasuriya,  Gunaalan,  and  Gunasekara  2018;  Warnasuriya, \nKumara,  Gunasekara,  Gunaalan,  and  Jayathilaka  2020).  The  wave  action  within  the \nselected season of the years (October, November, December) was comparatively low \nbecause there was no direct influence of the inter-monsoon (October\u2013November) and \nnorth-east  monsoon  (December\u2013February)  on  the  study  area  (Schott  and  McCreary \n2001;  Gunaratna  et  al.  2011;  Tomczak  and  Godfrey  2013;  Thevasiyani  and  Perera \n2014; Bamunawala et al. 2015). \n\nTable 1: Approximate Spatial Resolution of the High-Resolution Satellite  \nImages from the Google Earth Platform \n\nDate \nDec. 2005 \nDec. 2010 \nNov. 2015 \nDec. 2019 \n\nApproximate Spatial Resolution (m) \n0.31\u20131.84 \n0.31\u20131.84 \n0.31\u20131.84 \n0.31\u20131.84 \n\nNote:  The  study  used  data  sources  and  visual  interpretation  of  GE  images  by  distinguishing  the  minimum  possible \nidentifiable objects to determine the approximate spatial resolution.  \n\nGround  truth  investigation  obtained  ground  control  points  (GCPs)  in  places;  physical \nshoreline  alteration  with  protective  structures  affected  shoreline  positions  and \npermanent  structures  (harbors  and  buildings)  and  adjusted  ecosystems  (sand  dunes \nand  vegetation).  The  ground  survey  obtained  GCP  locations  using  the  Garmin \nGPSMAP 64s Global Positioning System (GPS).  \n\nIn the shoreline extraction, the tilt of  the images of the study area, the scale, and the \neye altitude (300 m) remained similar for each image throughout the process to remove \nthe  errors  arising  during  digitization  due  to  the  zoom  level  (Warnasuriya, Kumara, \nGunasekara,  Gunaalan,  and  Jayathilaka  2020). The  authors  saved  the  digitized \nshorelines in Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file format and converted the KML files \ninto  \u201clayer  files\u201d  using  the  ArcGIS  10.6  software.  They  projected  all  the  digitized \nshorelines to the WGS 1984 UTM 44N projection system.  \n\n2.2.2   Shoreline Rectification \n\nThe authors checked the accuracy of the satellite images using 15 GCPs and applied \ngeometric  corrections  to  each  shoreline  before  conducting  the  analysis  process \n(Figure 1).  They  estimated  slight  shifts  of  GE  satellite  images  due  to  geo-referencing \nerrors and platform-oriented errors with reference to the GCPs in the satellite image of \n2011, which was closely related to the ground truth data (Warnasuriya, Gunaalan, and \nGunasekara 2018).

After  appending, \nthey  created  buffer  polygons  with  100  m  width  for  each  shoreline  and  merged  the \nbuffer polygons to create the baseline. They managed all these activities in a specific \npersonal  geodatabase  using  the  ArcGIS  10.6  software.  They  created  two  feature \nclasses to represent the shoreline and baseline in the same geodatabase and used the \nappended  shoreline  dataset  to  create  a  shoreline  feature  class;  they  then  used  the \ncreated buffer polygon to create a baseline feature class with specific attributes.  \n\nThe  study  used  the  standard  deviation  of  the  positional  shift  as  the  initial  uncertainty \n(U1)  and  considered  the  tidal  influence  as  the  second  uncertainty  (U2)  to  detect \nshoreline  changes.  The  average  tidal  variation  on  the  western  coast  of  Sri  Lanka  is \n0.2\u20130.3m  (Wijeratne  and  Pattiaratchi  2006).  Then,  the  authors  calculated  the  tidal \ninfluence on the shoreline: \n\nTan\u019f = \n\n \n\nAverage Tide Variation (m)\n\nShoreline Displacement (m)\n\nwhere \u019f is the average slope angle (Warnasuriya, Gunaalan, and Gunasekara 2018). \nThey calculated the cumulative uncertainty for each shoreline using \n\nU = U1 + U2 \n\nU\u2014cumulative uncertainty \n\nU1\u2014uncertainty due to positional shift (m) \n\nU2\u2014uncertainty due to tidal influence (m) \n\nThey used the DSAS version 5.0 tool in the ArcGIS software to calculate the shoreline \nchange  statistics.  They  added  the  date  field  and  uncertainty  field  to  each  shoreline \nlayer  and  entered  the  data  into  the  respective  attribute  tables  (for  shoreline \nrectification).  Then,  they  created  the  \u201ctransect  layer\u201d  by  casting  transects  in  5  m \nintervals along the baseline, allowing the transects to cross all the shorelines.  \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K.

Then, they delineated the coastal protective \nstructures for the time period from 2005 to 2019 based on the satellite images from the \nGE  platform  with  the  same  eye  altitude  of  300  m.  They  adjusted  these  for  all  the \nsatellite images to avoid errors arising during the digitization process due to the zoom \nlevel in the GE software itself.  \n\nThe authors  saved  these digitized coastal  protective  structures  in  the  KML  file  format \nyear  by  year.  They  measured  and  recorded  the  length  of  each  coastal  protective \nstructure separately according to the following categories: \n\n\u2022  Groynes  (fishtail  groyne,  roundhead  groyne,  \u2018L\u2019  shaped  groyne,  \u2018T\u2019  shaped \n\n\u2022  Breakwaters \n\n\u2022  Revetments (artificial walls) \n\ngroyne) \n\n\u2022  Coves \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\n2.2.5   Extraction of Coastal Developments  \n\nThe authors delineated all the coastal developments (harbors/land fillings and coastal \nprotective structures) making physical alterations to the shoreline by digitizing the total \narea of development within the study area. \n\n2.3  Data Analysis \n\nThe net shoreline movement (NSM) explained the distance between the oldest (2005) \nand  the  youngest  (2019)  shoreline  (Oyedotun  2014).  The  NSM  revealed  the  overall \nshoreline change based on the shoreline position during the 15-year period. \n\nThe authors derived the end point rate (EPR) by dividing the distance of the shoreline \nmovement by the time elapsed between the oldest and the youngest shoreline position \n(Oyedotun  2014).  They  divided  the  distance  between  the  oldest  (2005)  and  the \nyoungest  (2019)  shoreline  by  the  time  period  of  the  study.  The  shoreline  change \nenvelope (SCE) is the measurement of the total change of the shoreline positions with \ntheir  distance  without  specifying  the  study  dates  (Oyedotun  2014;  Himmelstoss, \nHenderson, Kratzmann, and Farris 2018).  \n\nFigure 3: Flow Chart Showing the Overall Methodology that the Study Adopted  \n\n \nNote:  GPS:  Global  Positioning  System,  GCP:  Ground  Control  Points,  SD:  Standard  Deviation,  EPR:  End  Point  Rate, \nNSM: Net Shoreline Movement, SCE: Shoreline Change Envelope. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nThe  DSAS  v5.0  tool  (extension)  in  the  ArcGIS  10.6  software  calculated  the  shoreline \nchange  statistics  for  the  net  shoreline  movement  (NSM),  end  point  rate  (EPR),  and \nshoreline change envelope (SCE) to estimate the shoreline changes. MS Excel and the \nMinitab  17  software  analyzed  the  other  results  (coastal  protective  structures,  coastal \ndevelopments,  and  coastal  area).  After  analyzing  the  collected  data,  the  authors \nclarified  the  relationship  between  the  protective  hard  structures  and  the  shoreline \nchanges. The study\u2019s overall methodology, from data collection and data processing to \ndata analysis, is as follows (Figure 3): \n\n3.  RESULTS  \n\n3.1  The Shoreline Changes along the Coastal Zone  \nof the Western and North-Western Provinces \n\nThe  EPR  value  shows  high  variation  along  the  shorelines  in  the  Western  and  \nNorth-Western provinces within the respective study period (Figure 4). The shorelines \nof the total study area record the distinguished changes in the EPR.  \n\nThe  EPR  levels  exhibit  nine  color  variations  according  to  the  differences  in  erosion  \nand accretion. The bright red (\n) represents the area that has experienced a very \nhigh  erosion  rate  with  X<EPR\u2264\u20133.0,  and  the  different  shades  of  red  represent  high \nerosion  (\n)  with  a  \n)  with  a  \u20133.0<EPR\u2264\u20132.0  rate  range,  moderate  erosion  (\n) with a \u20131.0<EPR\u2264\u20130.5 rate range. \n\u20131.0<EPR\u2264\u20132.0 rate range, and low erosion (\n)  represents  the  stable  condition  in  the  shorelines  with  a  rate  of  \nThe  yellow  (\n) with 0.5<EPR\u22641.0, \n\u20130.5<EPR\u22640.5. The shades of green represent low accretion (\nmoderate accretion (\n) with 2.0<EPR\u22643.0, \n) with 1.0<EPR\u22642.0, high accretion (\nand very high accretion (\n\n) from 3.0<EPR\u2264X, which the bright green represents. \n\nThe  place  with  the  highest  recorded  EPR  in  Kalutara  district  is  Kaluwamodara-West \nwith 24.47 m yr-1. This area is adjacent to the Bentota River estuary, where seasonally \nwashed  particles  from  the  upper  land  form  deposits  in  the  estuarine  mouth  and  the \nadjacent  coastal  area.  The  place  with  the  lowest  recorded  EPR  in  Kalutara  district  is \nKalutara-South (Katukurunda) with \u201319.06 m yr-1.

The Kandakuliya area of Kalpitiya peninsular in Puttalam \ndistrict shows the lowest EPR due to the highest level of erosion in the total study area \nof the Western and North-Western provinces. According to Samanmali, Piyadasa, and \nWickramasinghe  (2014),  the  Kudawa  area  of  the  Kalpitiya  peninsular  experienced \naccretion  due  to  sand  deposition  from  1973  to  2014,  and  the  unconsolidated  sand \nmaterials created a headland, while the shorelines of adjacent zones moved landward. \nHowever, a considerable area of this peninsular was highly dynamic due to wind, wave, \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K.

The highest EPR due to \nerosion observable in this particular area is erosion of this unstable headland.  \n\nFigure 5 shows the significant variation in the EPR value due to the Transact ID during \nthe 15-year time period in each study area.  \n\nFigure 5: Graphical Representation of the EPR of Kalutara, Colombo, Gampaha, \nand Puttalam Districts and Wilpattu (Modaragam-aru to Dutch Bay) Region \n\n EPR - Modaragam-Aru\n\n \n\n)\nr\ny\n/\nm\n\n(\n \nR\nP\nE\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n24\n\n541\n\n1059\n\n1577\n\n2095\n\n3131\n\n3649\n\n4167\n\n4685\n\n5203\n\n2613\nTransectID\n\n \n\nThe coastal area of Wilpattu region, the region between the Modaragam-aru River and \nthe Dutch Bay, has fewer human interventions, based on the ground truth investigation \nand secondary data from the CC and CRM Department, than the Kalutara, Gampaha, \nColombo,  and  Puttalam  districts.  The  output  results  show  that  there  is  a  majorly  \nstable  and  accreted  coastal  zone  in  the  Wilpattu  region,  which  belongs  to  Wilpattu \nNational  Park.  Notably,  the  high  loss  of  the  coastal  zone  has  influenced  the \nKudiramalei point area of the Wilpattu region (8\u00b0 32\u02b9 19.37\u02ba N, 79\u00b0 52\u02b9 30.57\u02ba E\u20138\u00b0 32\u02b9 \n24.93\u02ba N, 79\u00b0 52\u02b9 27.81\u02ba E). Since it is a prominent headland area consisting of a sandy \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nand gravel shoreline, it undergoes seasonal changes, including loss and accumulation \n(Gillie 1997). \n\n3.1.1   Average Rates of Shoreline Change  \n\nWhen  considering  the  total  average  EPR  in  each  district,  as  Figure  6  shows,  the \nKalutara district recorded the highest rate of shoreline erosion (\u20131.21 \u00b1 0.04 m/yr) and \nthe Wilpattu region recorded the highest rate of accretion (0.95\u00b10.58 m/yr). Unlike the \nKalutara district,  the  Colombo and  Gampaha districts  also  recorded  changing  erosion \nrates. However, Puttalam district had a changing accretion rate.  \n\nFigure 6: Average Rate of the Shoreline Changes in each Selected Area \n\n \n\nThe  authors  compared  this  result  with  the  average  shoreline  change  rates  in  each \ndistrict  before  the  year  2000,  before  the  tsunami  disaster,  according  to  the  statistics \nthat the Ministry of Forestry and Environment published. When comparing the present \ndata derived after the tsunami with these data from before the tsunami, Kalutara district \nshowed a slight average accretion rate before the year 2000. Within the last 15 years, \nthe  average  erosion  rate  has  increased  enormously.  The  present  study  revealed  that \nthe  erosion  rate  in  Colombo  and  Gampaha  districts  have  also  increased  when \ncompared with the erosion rate before 2000. However, the study could not identify any \nprominent change in the average coastal dynamic rate of Puttalam district. \n\nTable 4: Comparison of the Data on Coastal Changes (Average Values)  \nin Each District by the Years 2000 and 2019 \n\nProvince \nWestern \n\nNorth-Western \n\nDistrict \n\nKalutara \nColombo \nGampaha \nPuttalam \n\nErosion (-)/Accretion (+) \nRates by 2000 (m/yr) \n0.1\u20130.4 \n0.0\u20130.1 \n0.9\u20131.0 \n0.2\u20130.4 \n\nErosion (-)/Accretion (+) \nRates by 2019 (m/yr) \n\u20131.21 \n\u20130.54 \n\u20130.7 \n\n0.26 \n\nSource:  Statistical  Compendium  on  Natural  Resources  Management  Sri  Lanka  2000,  Ministry  of  Forestry  and  the \nEnvironment. \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nThe  increasing  coastal  erosion  rate  in  Kalutara,  Colombo,  and  Gampaha  after  2000 \nmay  have  caused  the  destruction  of  natural  barriers,  like  corals,  and  protective \nvegetation,  like  mangroves,  due  to  the  vast  destructive  phenomenon  of  the  tsunami \n(Pattiaratchi  2005;  Devi  and  Shenoi  2012),  and,  over  time,  different  development \nprojects  have  carried  out  physical  alteration  of  the  shoreline  within  the  past  15  years \n(Figure 12). \n\nTo  conserve  the  coastal  zone,  the  CC  and  CRMD  of  Sri  Lanka  built  hard  protective \nstructures  with  the  collaboration  of  other  reputable  organizations.  These  structures \nprovided a temporary solution to coastal erosion by preventing the degradation of the \nbeach  (Pranzini  and  Williams  2013).  According  to  Silva  et  al.  (2014),  hard  protection \nstructures  are  the  main coastal  management  strategy  to  mitigate  the effect  of coastal \nerosion  in  Latin  American  countries,  in  European  countries,  and  on  the  Caribbean \ncoast of Colombia. \n\nHowever,  this  is  not  a  sustainable  solution  because  the  structures  tend  to  move  the \nerosion  along  the  coastal  zone  due  to  the  effect  of  longshore  sediment  transport \n(Rangel-Buitrago,  Williams,  and  Anfuso  2018).  When  considering  the  Kalutara, \nColombo, and Gampaha districts in the Western province, Colombo applied more hard \ntechniques  along  the  coastal  zone  than  the  other  two  districts  (Table  8).  Since  the \nmajority  of  them  are  revetments  and  breakwaters  of  the  Port  City  project  and \nColombo\u2019s commercial harbor, they may cause an increasing erosion rate in the other \ntwo districts due to the effect of longshore sediment transportation and seasonal winds. \n\nFurthermore,  the  application  of  hard  structures  has  negatively  affected  the  coastal \nscenery,  and  many  beaches  with  high  tourism  potential  now  have  little  scenic  value. \nThe negative visual impacts are the result of the environmental degradation associated \nwith  the construction  of hard protection  structures and  the collection of  coastal  debris \n(Williams  and  Micallef  2011;  Rangel-Buitrago,  Correa,  Anfuso,  Ergin,  and  Williams \n2013; Williams et al. 2018) \n\nThe Puttalam district (within the Wilpattu region) shows accretion and few influences of \nanthropogenic  activities,  like  the  Western  province,  and  the  Wilpattu  region  behaves \nnaturally,  so  it  tends  to  maintain  a  stable  environment  rather  than suffering  from high \nerosion or accretion. \n\n3.1.2   Percentage of Erosion and Accretion in Each Selected Area  \n\nAs  Figure  7  represented,  erosion  has  strongly  influenced  the  highest  percentage \n(75.55%)  of  shorelines  in  the  Kalutara  district  (approximately  three-fourths  of  the \nKalutara  coast  suffered  erosion)  and  the  Wilpattu  region  recorded  the  smallest  area  \nof  erosion,  with  a  high  accretion  percentage  (93.46%)  of  the  shoreline.  Relative  to  \nthe above rates of erosion and accretion (Figure 6), these results represent the same \neroded and accreted percentages. \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K.

However,  Colombo  and  Gampaha  experienced  extraordinary \nerosion percentages. These fluctuations could be due to the above-mentioned reasons. \nSimply, if the rate of shoreline changes increases, the percentage of shoreline changes \nincreases and vice versa. \n\nTable 5: Erosion and Accretion Percentage Data Comparison  \nin the Years 2000 and 2019 \n\nProvince \nWestern \n\nDistrict \n\nKalutara \nColombo \nGampaha \nPuttalam \n\nNorth-Western \n\nNote: n.a. = not available. \n\n2000 \n\n2019 \n\nErosion \nPercentage \n(%) \n70\u201380 \n20\u201325 \n45\u201350 \n30\u201340 \n\nAccretion \nPercentage \n(%) \n20\u201330 \nn.a. \n10\u201320 \n30\u201360 \n\nErosion \nPercentage \n(%) \n75.55 \n67.93 \n66.78 \n49.71 \n\nAccretion \nPercentage \n(%) \n24.45 \n32.07 \n33.22 \n50.29 \n\nSource: Statistical Compendium on Natural Resources Management Sri Lanka, Ministry of Forestry and Environment. \n\nThe  comparison  of  the  two  districts  with  the  greatest  erosional  changes  (Kalutara)  \nand  the  greatest  accretion  changes  (Puttalam),  using  the  SCE  statistical  data  of \nKalutara, showed that the maximum of 368 m accretion during the period 2010 to 2019 \noccurred  in  Kaluwamodara-West  region  (6\u00b033\u02b950.09\u02baN,  79\u00b059\u02b914.93  E\u20136\u00b026\u02b97.31\u02baN, \n79\u00b059\u02b927.92\u02baE)  and  the  least  dynamic  shoreline,  with  a  minimum  of  0.76  m  accretion \nfrom 2005 to 2015, was in Pothupitiya-West region (6\u00b038\u02b97.52\u02baN, 79\u00b056\u02b913.17\u02baE\u20136\u00b037\u02b9 \n55.45\u02baN,  79\u00b056\u02b917.75\u02baE).  Kaluwamodara-West  region\u2019s  considerably  higher  accretion \nlevel  may  be  due  to  freshwater  discharging  from  the  Benthota  River.  The  visual \nobservations  indicated  that  sand  and  mud  particles  that  washed  away  from  the  inner \nland  formed  deposits  around  this  estuary,  so  the  seaward  movement  of  land  \nis apparent. \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nFigure 8: Graphical Representation of the SCE of Kalutara, Colombo, Gampaha, \nand Puttalam Districts \n\n \n\n \n\nThe SCE of Puttalam district indicated that the coastal zone of Puttalam has a stable \nand  accretional  beach  with  a  low  level  of  erosion.  The  upper  part  of  the  Kalpitiya \npeninsula  showed  a  comparatively  high  erosion  rate  and  high  shoreline  movement, \nincluding  accretion  and  erosion.  Further,  the  study  identified  this  area  as  a  critical \nregion  based  on  the  large  shoreline  movement.  According  to  Samanmali,  Piyadasa, \nand  Wickramasinghe  (2014),  a  32  m/yr  shoreline  change  occurred  from  1973  \nto  2014  in  the  Kandakuliya  and  Kudawa  regions.  Further,  the  shoreline  change  \nvaried  between  32.3\u00b17.50  m/yr  and  \u201339.91\u00b17.50  m/yr  along  the  Kalpitiya  region \n(Kandakuliya\u2013Kudawa). These two results coincide and could be due mainly to natural \nphenomena,  the  sea-level  rise,  and  the  adverse  effects  of  climatic  change.  All  the \naquatic  ecosystems will  be  susceptible  to  variation  of  inundation,  and  coastal  erosion \nand  alterations  in  coastal  ecosystems  may  lead  to  the  sea  level  rising  (Nianthi  and \nShaw 2015). The sea level rise in Sri Lanka was 0.3 m by 2010, and forecasts indicate \nthat  the  sea  level  will  rise  by  1.0  m  by  2070  (NATCOM  2000).  It  will  also  lead  to \nincreased coastal erosion in the coastal zone of Sri Lanka (Nianthi and Shaw 2015). \n\nThe ground truth investigation reported considerable human interventions, like fisheries \nand  agriculture,  and  some  agro-economic  activities,  and,  according  to  Samanmali, \nPiyadasa,  and  Wickramasinghe  (2014),  regarding  the  \u201csea  level  rise  and  its  impacts  \non  Kalpitiya  peninsula\u201d  in  2019,  the  coastal  area  of  Kalpitiya  peninsula  is  prone  to \nmany coastal hazards and sea level rise, and coastal erosion is related to the natural \nprocess  of  the  climate,  such  as  the  wind  direction,  wind  speed,  and  wave  speed. \nFurthermore, Senevirathne et al. (2017) mentioned that coastal changes mainly occur \nwhen  wind,  waves,  and  longshore  currents  carry  sand  from  the  shore  and  deposit  it \nsomewhere else. \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K.

Therefore, \nthese  shoreline  changes  can  be  due  mainly  to  the  various  development  activities \ncausing  physical  alterations  of  shorelines,  seasonal  changes,  other  anthropogenic \ninterventions,  and  the  effect  of  the  applied  hard  coastal  protective  structures.  The \nhighest erosion rate is apparent around the Kalutara coast. In the estuary (Kaluganga \nestuary),  the  freshwater  output  of  Kaluganga  has  washed  away  all  the  sandbars  and \neroded a vast area of the beach in Kalutara North (Calido beach, Kalutara). According \nto the ground truth investigation, this is a result of the rough seas due to the south-west \nmonsoon in the last few years. \n\nThe study found that there is an unstable coastal zone all along the Colombo coast, but \nthe  Mount  Lavenia  and  Wellawatta  beaches  showed  moderate  erosion.  The  coast, \nincluding  Dehiwala,  Mount  Lavenia,  and  Wellawatta  beaches,  in  the  Colombo  district \nshowed severe seasonal erosion, mainly during the southwest monsoon (Lakmali et al. \n2017). According to that study, the erosion along the coast including Dehiwala, Mount \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nLavenia, and Wellawatta beach is not a permanent feature. The effect of erosion varies \nonly  seasonally  and  accretion  occurs  with  the  onset  of  the  fair-weather  north-eastern \nmonsoon. Colombo, as the capital of Sri Lanka, has experienced strong anthropogenic \ninterventions  and  alterations  of  the  coastal  zone  due  to  the  expansion  and \ndevelopment  of  the  city.  Port  City,  combined  with  the  Colombo  south  harbor  project, \nwas  the  major  development  activity  causing  physical  alterations  of  the  shoreline  in \nColombo.  Within  the  past  few  years,  it  may  have  caused  the  highest  erosion  and \naccretion rates around Port City. The coastal area of Colombo has adopted many hard \nprotection  techniques  (Table  8),  so  the  observed  erosion  along  most  of  the  Colombo \ncoast  is  not  permanent.  Lakmali  et  al.  (2017)  reported  that  the  seasonal  changes \nrecover  and  accretion  occurs  after  the  rough  season.  Therefore,  there  is  a  stable \ncondition  or  dynamic  equilibrium  in  the  present  day  and  no  long-term  erosion  is \nobservable. \n\nAccording  to  the  results  represented,  there  is  also  a  considerably  stable  beach  all \naround the Gampaha coast. The past data recorded that the erosion has affected the \nUswatakeiyawa  and  Negombo  coastal  areas  of  Gampaha  district  moderately.  Even \nthough the areas have already introduced coastal protection techniques, erosion is still \napparent  here.  The  community  in  the  area  and  the  responsible  fishery  associations  \nof  Sri  Lanka  have  accused  the  construction  of  the  Port  City  project  of  causing  this \naggravated  erosion.  However,  according  to  the  data  that  the  Marine  Environment \nProtection  Authority  (MEPA)  and  the  Coast  Conservation  and  Coastal  Resource \nManagement Department (CC and CRMD) collected, there is no scientific proof of the \neffect of the Port City on coastal erosion (Gunawansa 2018). Nevertheless, according \nto Beaven et al. (2018), landfills are a major issue in shoreline management planning \n(SMP), which aims to manage the risks associated with flooding and coastal erosion.  \n\nFigure 9: Near-Shore Sediment Transportation Directions \n\nSource: Long-term coastal erosion and shoreline positions of Sri Lanka (Lakmali et al. 2017). \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nIn addition, the sediment deposition pattern associated with breakwaters and groynes \nin the entire area shows sand transportation predominantly toward the north (Figure 9). \nAccording  to  Lakmali  et  al.  (2017),  sediment  deposition  in  the  northern  section \ncharacterizes  the  south-western  coastal  area,  whereas  erosion  characterizes  the \nsouthern  section,  implying  predominant  sediment  transportation  toward  the  north. \nTherefore,  the  south-western  monsoon  winds,  which  power  the  northerly-directed \nlongshore transport, predominantly governs the south-western coastal belt. \n\nWhen  comparing  the  topographical  characteristics  of  each  site  that  recorded  the \nlargest erosion changes and largest accretion changes, it became apparent that most \nof  the  sites  have  a  significant  feature  that  causes  their  shoreline  behavior.  The \nKaluwamodara region, which has the highest EPR in the Kalutara district, is adjacent to \nthe  Bentota  River  estuary.  Here,  the  washed  particles  from  the  inner  land  can  form \ndeposits around the estuary, causing accretion changes in the area. The Mount Lavinia \nsite with a low EPR in Colombo district and the Dikowita site in Gampaha, which also \nhas a  low  EPR,  have adjoined hard  structures.  Furthermore,  the  Dikowita site  is very \nnear  to  the  Dikowita  harbors.  Sandy  beaches  completely  cover  the  Kudawa  and \nKandakuliya sites. Due to the minimum human interventions in this region, the behavior \nof wind, waves, and longshore currents tend to move sand from one place to another. \nFinally, these areas have faced instant shoreline changes. \n\n3.2  Application of Coastal Protective Constructions \n\nThe  main  hard  coastal  protective  constructions  that  this  study  considered  are \nrevetments, breakwaters, coves, and groynes. \n\nFigure 10: Categorized Hard Structures in the Study Area: (A) Revetments,  \n(B) Breakwaters, (C) Coves, and (D) Groynes \n\nA \n\nB \n\nC \n\nD \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Breakwaters and cove images from GE imagery. \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nIn  the  current  study,  areas  have  mainly  implemented  revetments  as  a  coastal \nprotective structure up to 23,554 m length (9.05%), covering 18,960 m in the Western \nprovince and 4,594 m in the North-Western province. The revetment is in the land ward \nmargin  of  the  boundary  between  the  sea  and  the  land,  and  the  parallel  structure \nreduces  the  wave  action  using  solid  durable  structures,  such  as  granite  boulders. \nAreas have commonly used  revetments to  protect  soft  landforms,  dunes,  and  coastal \nslopes to provide additional protection to address the erosion hazards. The protective \neffect of a revetment depends on the coastal area that implements it.  \n\nThe  extents  of  the  coastal  revetment  in  Kalutara,  Colombo,  Gampaha,  and  Puttalam \ndistricts  were  approximately  7,133  m,  9,432  m,  2,395  m,  and  4,594  m,  and  their \ncoverage  percentages  of  the  total  coastal  length  were  16.85%,  38.81%,  6.90%,  and \n2.88%,  respectively.  The  high  net  erosion  rate  that  the  Kalutara  district  recorded \ncaused the implementation of a considerable extent of coastal revetments.  \n\nThe total constructed lengths of breakwaters in the above districts, respectively, were \n1,903 m, 702 m, 2,175 m, and 4,141 m. The total numbers of groynes in those districts \nwere 19, 2, 29, and 91, respectively. According to the results, there were three coves  \nin Kalutara, no coves in Colombo and Gampaha, and two coves in Puttalam at the end \nof 2019. \n\nTable 8: Total Hard Structures in Kalutara, Colombo, Gampaha,  \nand Puttalam Districts \n\nKalutara \n\nYear \n2005 \n2009 \n2014 \n2019 \n\nYear \n2005 \n2009 \n2014 \n2019 \n\nBW (m)  Rvts (m)  Groynes  Coves  Year \n2005 \n1,125.4 \n2009 \n1,198.1 \n2014 \n1,256.9 \n2019 \n1,902.9 \n\n3,494.5 \n3,515 \n4,944.1 \n7,132.7 \n\n12 \n10 \n10 \n19 \n\n3 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n\nGampaha \n\nBW (m)  Rvts (m)  Groynes  Coves  Year \n2005 \n1,911.3 \n2009 \n1,674.6 \n2014 \n1,784.5 \n2019 \n2,175 \n\n2,924.4 \n3,505.6 \n2,921.3 \n2,394.5 \n\n20 \n24 \n25 \n29 \n\n1 \n \n \n \n\nBW (m) \n1,045.1 \n725.4 \n493.6 \n701.9 \n\nBW (m) \n463.4 \n469.8 \n2,944.5 \n4,151.3 \n\nColombo \nRvts (m)  Groynes  Coves \n1 \n8,804.7 \n3 \n9,373 \n2 \n10,401.2 \n2 \n9,432.3 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nPuttalam \nRvts (m)  Groynes  Coves \n19 \n4,517.3 \n19 \n4,492 \n36 \n4,746.6 \n91 \n4,593.5 \n\n2 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n\nAt the end of 2019, Puttalam district specifically, on the Kalpitiya peninsular, applied a \nvast amount of different hard structures: revetments and groynes. The unconsecrated \nsand layer around the Kalpitiya peninsular has suffered from a high erosion rate. \n\nIn 2005, the greatest application of hard structures took place within Colombo district. \nHowever,  the  Port  City  development  project  caused  this  application  to  decrease  from \n2014  to  2019  because  of  the  removal  of  the  hard  structures  around  the  region  that \ncovered the Port City in Colombo and the damage to the revetments in certain places.  \n\nFurthermore, other districts have gradually increased the application of hard structures \nover  time.  According  to  Figure  6,  Kalutara  and  Gampaha  have  average  erosion  \nrates,  so  they  have  applied  hard  structures  as  precautions.  In  the  Puttalam  district, \nthere  is  an  average  accretion  rate,  but  Puttalam  has  implemented  a  huge  number  \nof  hard  structures  to  prevent  adverse  changes  to  the  shoreline  in  certain  regions.  As  \nan  example,  the  region  from  Maha-oya  estuary,  Wennappuwa,  Marawila,  to  Chilaw \n(7\u00b016\u02b942.39\u02baN,  79\u00b050\u02b927.75\u02baE\u20137\u00b03\u02b94.83\u02baN,  79\u00b047\u02b924.85\u02baE)  applied  an  enormous \namount of protective structures with a groyne series consisting of 38 individual groynes \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nand  a  series  of  breakwaters  with  revetments  (Rathnayakage  et  al.  2020).  When \ncomparing  the  applied  hard  structures  in  each  district,  all  four  districts  have  used \nrevetments extensively while using coves minimally.  \n\nAnon (1997) mentioned the length of the existing effective shoreline protection works in \n1996  for  revetments  and  groynes  as  follows.  When  comparing  this  with  the  data  for \n2019, it showed that there was greater application of coastal structures in 1996 than in \n2019 (revetments). The reduction of structures may be due to the destruction occurring \nover  time,  removal  due  to  developments,  disappearance,  or  due  to  the  beach  filling \nfollowing accretion and the tsunami phenomenon in 2004.  \n\nTable 9: Data Comparison of Applied Hard Structures in 1996 and 2019 \n\nCoastal Region \nRevetments \nWest Coast (Gampaha, Colombo) \nGroynes \nWest Coast (Gampaha, Colombo) \n\nTotal Length (m) 1996 \n5,633 \n\nTotal Length (m) 2019 \n11,827 \n\n2,135 \n\n6,309 \n\nSource: Anon (1997) (Coastal Area Management in Sri Lanka). \n\nAccording  to  the  National  Action  Plan  for  Protection  of  Marine  and  Coastal \nEnvironment  from  Land-Based  Activities  (1999),  revetments  provide  protection  to  the \nlength of the coastline that they cover, and their cost-effectiveness is greater than that \nof other hard structures. \n\nFigure  11  proves  that  the  Western  province  has  implemented  a  larger  amount  of \ncoastal  protection  techniques  to  conserve  the  coastal  zone  than  the  North-Western \nprovince. This conservation method is based entirely on utilization, humans\u2019 alterations \nof the shoreline, and the adverse effects of natural phenomena. The Western province \n(Colombo,  Kalutara,  and  Gampaha)  has  utilized  its  coastal  zone  more  to  for \ndevelopment projects, the tourism industry, residences, infrastructure, and so on than \nthe North-Western province. To some extent, there has been minimal human influence \nalong  the  North-Western  province\u2019s  shoreline,  so  there  is  a  naturally  behaving  sandy \nbeach up to Kalpitiya peninsula. \n\nFigure 11: Total Hard Structures in the North-Western and Western Provinces \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K.

When considering the shoreline changes within \nthe  selected  site,  it  is  possible  to  categorize  them  into  the  rates  of  low  erosion  \n(\u20131.0<EPR\u2264\u20130.5), stable condition (\u20130.5<EPR\u22640.5), low accretion (0.5<EPR\u22641.0), and \noccasionally high  accretion  around  the selected  hard  structure.  The  NSM  also  shows \nlow erosional movements and accretion movements at the site. The shoreline change \nvariability  (SCE)  represents  more  accretional  movements  than  erosional  movements. \nWhen comparing the shoreline change rates of groynes, breakwaters, and revetments \nwithin the site, it is apparent that there are only stable and accretion rates around the \nbreakwaters and there are accretion shoreline movements other than around groynes \nand revetments.  \n\nAll  the  EPR  changes  adjacent  to  the  selected  site  (1  km)  and  5  km  away  have  \nlow  erosion  (\u20131.0<EPR\u2264\u20130.5),  stable  condition  (\u20130.5<EPR\u22640.5),  and  low  accretion \n(0.5<EPR\u22641.0) rates, with moderate and high erosion occurring rarely. In addition, it is \npossible  to  identify  the  NSM  of  each  site  as  low  erosional  movements  and  low \naccretional  movements.  The  hard  structures,  like  groynes  and breakwaters,  are  good \nfor the site but not much better for the adjacent area. The current study does not fully \ndescribe  the  direct  relationship  between  the  coastal  protective  structures  and  the \nshoreline  changes,  but  there  is  a  minimal  effect  from  the  hard  structures  on  the \nshoreline  changes  because  somewhat  controlled  changes  are  apparent  to  a  certain \nextent. However, regarding the original purpose of applying hard structures, they have \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nnot achieved the same success as examples elsewhere in the world (Rangel-Buitrago, \nWilliams, and Anfuso 2018). \n\n3.3  Coastal Development through Physical Alteration  \n\nof the Shoreline \n\nThe  data  in  Figure  12  represent  areas\u2019  execution  of  coastal  developments  causing \nphysical  alteration  of  the  shoreline  over  the  past  20  years  within  the  Western  and \nNorth-Western  provinces.  There  are  five  main  harbors  and  a  landfilling  area  that \ndeveloped  from  altering  the  shoreline  in  the  study  area.  The  Colombo  harbor,  the \nfishery  harbor  in  Colombo,  and  the  Beruwala  fishery  harbors  have  existed  from  the \nearly  2000s  up  to  the  present  in  the  Western  province.  From  2009  to  2011,  a  small \nharbor was located in Pothupitiya, Kalutara. The governing body selected this area as \na  suitable  coastal  stretch,  extending  over  a  72,000  m2  area,  for  siting  the  temporary \nquarry  rock  loadout  point  (LoP)  for  the  transshipment  of  rock  to  Colombo.  It  has \nfinished  the  construction  of  a  temporary  breakwater  extending  over  500  m  and  a \nseafront wall and has been undertaking the dredging of the basin since October 2008 \n(Lee et al. 2010). It established the Dikowita fishery harbor and Colombo south harbor \nin  2010  and  a  huge  area  incrementation  in  Colombo  south  harbor  by  2019  by \nexpanding  the  wave  breaks  to  protect  the  harbor.  Furthermore,  the  mass  artificial \nlandfilling project \u201cPort City\u201d commenced in 2015 and has now expanded over 269 ha \nas an additional part of Sri Lanka in Colombo district. \n\nFigure 12: Coastal Development by Physical Alteration of the Shoreline  \nwithin the Past 20 Years \n\n \n\nThis graph shows the increase in areas of coastal developments from 2000 to 2019. \n\nFinally, this study has helped to prove that all these human influences or anthropogenic \ninterventions have caused shoreline changes directly or indirectly in this study area. In \naddition,  there  is  an  effect  of natural  phenomena,  like  tidal  variations,  sea-level  rises, \nstorm  surges,  and  so  on.  These  two  causes  are  interconnected.  If  highly  adverse \nactivities occur around the coastal zone, they cause adverse behaviors of the sea, and \nthe  aggravated  behaviors  of  the  sea  tend  to  increase  the  human  influence  on  the \ncoastal  zone.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  study  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  shoreline \nwith  respect  to  wind  patterns,  current  patterns,  sea-level  rises,  and  natural  barriers, \nwhich help to protect the coastal zone. \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\n4.  CONCLUSIONS  \n\nL.C.K. Abeykoon et al. \n\nThe  findings  highlighted  that  the  part  of  the  study  area  experiencing  coastal  erosion \ndue  to  anthropogenic  activities  may  face  more  drastic  changes  in  its  shoreline  and \nenvironment than other areas in the Western and North-Western regions of Sri Lanka. \nTherefore,  anthropogenic  activities  are  the  leading  factor  in  coastal  erosion  in  the \nrespective  study  area  rather  than  natural  scenarios  such  as  a  sea-level  rise,  climatic \nchanges,  and  natural  disaster  conditions.  The  application  of  hard  structures  is  the \nsolution  that  is  least  able  to  control  coastal  erosion  in  a  large  area  because  applying \nhard  structure  is  good  for  the  site  but  not  very  helpful  for  other  adjacent  areas. \nTherefore,  as  long  as  humans  introduce  no  alterations,  the  environment  will  remain \nunder its natural conditions. If the shoreline is changing naturally, as humans, we have \nto adjust rather than alter it. Furthermore, proper identification of the dynamic nature of \nthe  shoreline  that  is  occurring  due  to  the  behavior  of  wave  patterns  and  coastal \ncurrents,  obligatory  subsidies  for  the  conservation  and  management  of  the  coastal \nzone, buffering capacity from natural coastal ecosystems, and coastal-based industries \nare very important. This study may provide information regarding where and when ad \nhoc coastal zone development projects and ad hoc soft and hard coastal conservation \nprograms will work effectively within the coastal zone. \n\n4.1  Limitations of the Study \n\nThe  authors  based  this  study  on  the  analysis  of  GIS  and  remote  sensing  data. \nBasically,  the  digitization  relied  on  visual  interpretations,  and  errors  can  occur  in  the \nfinal  results  if  the  remotely  sensed  data  do  not  undergo  correct  preprocessing. \nInsufficient  previous  data  and  studies  regarding  shoreline  changes  in  this  area  were \navailable to carry out a comparative study. \n\n4.2  Recommendations for Future Research \n\nThis  research  mainly  focused  on  the  shoreline  changes  and  the  effect  of  human \ninfluences  and  natural  phenomena  on  the  Western  and  North-Western  provinces\u2019 \ncoasts. Further study could identify the changes along the whole coastline of Sri Lanka \nand establish a proper mechanism to define the predictability and the dynamic nature \nof  the  shoreline  and  the  effect  of  a  sea-level  rise,  the  current  patterns,  and  the  wind \npatterns  on  the  shoreline.  The  findings  of  further  studies  can  assist  in  revising  the \ncoastal management plan to ensure effective management approaches. \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1240 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nL.C.K.

The  Western  and  North-Western  provincial  coasts  of  \nSri  Lanka  are  economically  significant  and  have  a  highly  dynamic  nature.  This  study used \nsatellite  images  from  the  Google  Earth  platform  to  analyze  the  changes  occurring  in  the \ncoastal zone during the period between 2005 and 2019 on the Western and North-Western \nprovincial  coasts  of  Sri  Lanka.  The  results  revealed  that  the average coastal  erosion  rates \nare  \u20131.21\u00b10.04  m  yr-1  in  Kalutara,  \u20130.54\u00b10.63  m  yr-1  in  Colombo,  and  \u20130.7\u00b10.58  m  yr-1  in \nGampaha district. Puttalam district showed a 0.26\u00b10.07 m yr-1 average accretion rate, while \nthe highest accretion rate (0.95 \u00b1 0.58 m yr-1) was evident in the coastal region of Wilpattu \nNational  Park,  an  area  that  has  few  anthropogenic  interventions.  The  application  of  hard \nstructures to mitigate the effect of coastal erosion has increased within the past 15 years. At \nthe  end  of  2019,  the  country  mainly  used  revetments  up  to  23,554  m  in  length  (occupying \n9.05% of the total study area), consisting of 18,960 m in the Western province (7.29%) and \n4,594  m  in  the  North-Western  province  (1.76%).  The  Western  province  has  applied  more \nhard structures at a higher rate than the North-Western province due to mega-development \nprojects.  Overall,  anthropogenic  activities  are  affecting  coastal  erosion  in  that  area  more \nthan  natural  or  global  scenarios,  and  the  applied  hard  structures  have  little  capability  to \ncontrol erosion.  \n \nKeywords: coastal hard structures, erosion, accretion, anthropogenic impacts, shoreline  \n \nJEL Classification: Q20, Q53, Q57 \n \n", " \n"]}
