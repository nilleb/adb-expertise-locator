Cambodia\n\nIntroduction\n\n \n\nCambodia\u2019s online population is growing rapidly . \n\nIn 2000, only 6,000 Cambodians were online \n(Luedi 2017) . According to the International \nTelecommunication Union (ITU), about 26% \nof Cambodian (or over 4 million) were using the Internet \nby 2016 . According to the Cambodian Ministry of Posts \nand Telecommunications, about 9 .5 million Cambodians, \nor 60% of the population, will have internet access \nby 2020 (United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment  or UNCTAD 2017a) . \n\nAs in other developing economies, most Cambodians \naccess the internet using smartphones . In early 2017, \n94% of Cambodians had access to a mobile phone, 40% \nof which were smartphones (Luedi 2017) .\n\nThe rapidly growing Cambodian e-commerce market \nis attracting e-commerce companies . Xinhua, quoting \na marketing officer of the Cambodian shopping \nwebsite Shop168, reported there were about 20 \nbusiness-to-customer (B2C) sites in Cambodia in 2015 \n(Sovan\u00a02015) . \n\nNonetheless, only a small proportion of Cambodians \nwith access to the internet use it to make purchases . \nAccording to\u00a0market and social research company \nKantar TNS\u2019s\u00a0Connected Life report, as of 2016, only 8% \nof Cambodians shopped online (Hale 2016) . This was \nabout the same proportion as observed in Myanmar, \nwhich lags Cambodia in most other information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) indicators . \n\nBiggest barriers to the development of e-commerce \nmarket in the economies of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) include limited \nbroadband access, financial exclusion of a large societal \ngroup, mistrust in online transactions, and a lack of \nharmonization of regulatory frameworks among the \n\nmember states (Caraballo 2017) . These problems are \nmore prevalent among consumers and businesses in low \nor lower middle-income economies . According to the \nUNCTAD Information Economy Report 2015, Cambodia \nhas one of the lowest e-commerce indexes in the region . \nWith an index value of 30 .8, the country ranked 92 out \nof 130 economies . \n\nOverview of the Cambodian \nE-commerce Industry and Market \n\nCambodia\u2019s rapidly growing e-commerce market has \nattracted diverse players . Table 1 presents some of the \nkey ones . It is important to note that value, convenience, \nand wide product range are important success factors \nfor attracting online consumers . Cambodia has yet to \nsee a local high profile e-commerce player that performs \nreasonably satisfactory across these criteria . \n\nKantar TNS (2016) identified three key factors \naffecting consumers\u2019 tendency to buy online: (i) \nthe value consumers derive from online shopping, \n(ii)\u00a0convenience, and (iii) the ability to access a wider \nproduct range than available from alternative channels . \nThe last benefit on the list is often a unique selling \nproposition for Cambodian e-commerce players . In an \ninterview, Eelco Dijkhuizen, general manager of Kantar \nTNS Cambodia, noted that the real value proposition \nof e-commerce in Cambodia is that consumers can buy \nproducts that are often not available in regular retail \noutlets . This is because the Cambodian retail market \nis\u00a0small . \n\nDomestic players are adapting to local conditions . \nItems are delivered through local couriers (Hale 2016) . \nFor instance, a cash-on-delivery service is available for \nShop168 customers in Phnom Penh, while Customers \noutside the capital city are required to pay through the \nmobile payment company WING . Products are delivered \nby the logistic company Viettel Post (Sovan 2015) . \n\n\f3\n\nTable 1: Some Key E-commerce Participants in Cambodia\n\nCompany\n\nLittle Fashion\n\nExplanation\n\nRemarks\n\nOffers its own delivery-by-moto service. 2014: up to 50 deliveries a day\n\nKhmer24\n\nCreated in 2009, biggest online market in \nCambodia.\n\nJuly 2013: more than 70,000 users, 9,000,000 pages viewed per month.\n\nCambo Quick\n\n2017: handled about 300 orders per month; more during the holiday season.\n\nStarted Facebook commerce in 2010, selling apparel, \nfootwear, bags, accessories and beauty products\u2014\nalso sold in brick-and-mortar stores. \nOctober 2017: about 1.5 million Facebook \u2018likes\u2019.\n\nBegan operations in mid-2014. It processes orders \non Amazon via an address in the United States. \nHandles logistics and applicable duties for delivery \nto Cambodia. \n\nOperates a web portal and Facebook page, delivering \nproducts ordered from Amazon\u2019s full catalogue. \nNormal delivery time is 10-20 days.\n\nApril 2015: Worldbridge International and \nACLEDA Bank\u2019s MAIO Mall began selling clothes, \njewelry, groceries, accessories, electronic products \nand other items online. \n\nShop168 helps established stores place products \nonto its web portal. \n\nA C2C website that allows consumers to sell goods \nto one another. Consumers use Mall 855 to sell \nitems such as washing machines, cars and houses.\n\nStarted in December 2013 as a website for \ncosmetics and skincare products, with 50 types of \ncosmetics items from the Republic of Korea, and \noffering about 2,000 items by July 2015.\n\nFado168\n\nMAIO Mall\n\nShop168\n\nMall 855\n\nRoserb\n\nAugust 2017: handled over 200,000 transactions.\n\nSeptember 2017: Web.horde.org reported that MAIO Mall websites received \nabout 15,000 visitors monthly. 46.1% of the visitors were Cambodian and 99% \nfemales (http://web.horde.to/maiomall.com)\n\nAugust 2015: the company teamed up with 30 stores.\n\nCurrently makes money from advertisements. Buyers and sellers need to \nmake their own arrangements for payment and delivery. September 2017: \nMall 855 exploring partnership with a Malaysian company to provide payment \nsolutions. Also looking for logistics companies for delivery solutions. \n\nJuly 2015: shipped 170 to 220 packages per month, average value of \n$37.50\u00a0each.\n\nC2C = consumer-to-consumer.  \nSources: Benang Merah Komunikasi (2017), GeeksinCambodia (2013), Freischlad (2015a), McGrath (2017).\n\nA similar arrangement has been adopted by Roserb \n(Freischald 2015a) .\n\nB2C players such as Roserb focus on narrow niches . At \nthe opposite end are companies such as My All-In-One \n(MAIO) that offer diverse products . In April 2015, MAIO \nMall launched online stores selling clothes, groceries, \naccessories, and electronic products . MAIO also allows \npeople to pay bills, make online bookings, and borrow \nmoney . Shop168 helps established stores to put the \nproducts into its web portal . As of August 2015, the \ncompany had teamed up with 30 stores (Raksmey and \nKossov 2015) . Meawhile, C2C e-commerce transactions \ninvolving a wide range of products are made possible \nthrough companies such as Khmer24 . \n\nSome key developments are also taking place in the \nbusiness-to-business (B2B) e-commerce arena . In \nFebruary 2017, Kiu\u2014a multicurrency and multilingual \ne-commerce platform for small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs)\u2014was launched with the support \n\nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \nMekong Business Initiative . Kiu aims to help SMEs in \nthe lower Mekong region and initially covers Viet Nam \nand Cambodia (Nguyen 2017) . A goal is to allow local \nproducers and SMEs to access developed markets and \nhelp overseas buyers to source goods from suppliers \nfrom Cambodia and Viet Nam (Luedi 2017) . Kiu \nplatform\u2019s components include: (i) Kiu Marketplace, \nwhich lists products such as baby clothing, home d\u00e9cor, \nart and crafts and school supplies that consumers \nand wholesale importers can source to sellers in the \nMekong region; (ii) Kiu enterprise resource planning, a \nmanagement tool for SMEs; and (iii) Kiu Shipping, which \nhelps buyers to ship products they buy in the Mekong \nregion . As of February 2017, Kiu was reported to be \nworking with about 250 SMEs . At that time, it was also \nattracting five new suppliers every week (Nguyen 2017) .\n\nCambodia has also shown impressive achievements \nin some areas of government-to-consumer (G2C) \ne-commerce . In 2006, the Cambodian Ministry of \n\nE-commerce in Cambodia\f4\n\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation launched \nan e-Visa program . Visitors can apply for a Cambodia \ntravel visa online . Cambodia was arguably the first in the \nregion to do so (UNCTAD 2007) . \n\nThe private sector, industry associations, the \ngovernment, and international organizations have \ntaken initiatives to stimulate e-commerce adoption \nby companies in industries that are viewed as engines \nof economic growth . During 1994\u20132015, Cambodia\u2019s \neconomy experienced average annual growth of 7 .6% \nand ranked sixth among the fasted-growing economies \nin the world, based on World Bank data . The World \nBank attributed this impressive performance to garment \nexports and tourism . The Kiu platform is likely to help \ncompanies in garment makers adopt e-commerce . \n\nAs early as 2007, 63% of Cambodian Hotel Association \n(CHA) members in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap had \ntheir own websites (UNCTAD 2007) . All organizations \nin the travel and tourism sector are reported to have \nhomepages, which provide information and services \nsuch as for reservation and tickets . \n\nAs in neighboring countries such as Thailand and \nMyanmar, social commerce is a key feature of the \nCambodian e-commerce market (Krutaine 2016) . Some \nsmall Cambodian businesses have used Facebook as \nthe main storefront and a tool for increasing market \nreach . This is understandable since 90% of the online \npopulation in Cambodia is estimated to use Facebook \n(UNCTAD 2017a) . As of October 2017, 4 .8 million \nCambodians used Facebook (Spiess 2017) . Typically, \ncustomers can order through Facebook Messenger and \npay for and pick up orders from the store (Seeking Alpha \n2016) . As an example, Little Fashion started selling on \nFacebook in 2010 . Orders can be placed on Facebook \nor on the phone for cash-on-delivery . Little Fashion \nalso offers face-to-face customer service in its retail \npremises . It also offers its own delivery-by-moto service . \nAs of 2014, the company was reported to be making as \nmany as 50 deliveries a day (Eng and Pisey 2014) . \n\nBusiness Models \n\nKey e-commerce business models used in Cambodia \ninclude: internet portals, bundlers of services, and \nmanufacturers\u2019 agents . \n\nInternet portals \nTwo of the most popular models for an internet \nportal are: (i) a free model, in which some products \nand services are given away to create high traffic and \ntherefore advertising opportunities (e .g ., FreeStuff .\ncom\u00a0gives samples of household items such as coffee \nand moisturizer); and (ii) a content sponsorship model, \nwhich entails the creation of useful content, links, \nand services to attract visitors to generate advertising \nrevenue . In these models, users visit the website for \nfree products or useful content a (relational objective) . \nKhmer24 and Mall 855 follow the content sponsorship \nmodel . As mentioned, portals such as Mall 855 currently \nmake money from ads (a value-based objective). \n\nBundlers of services\nIn this model, an e-commerce company provides \nproducts and/or services together to attract buyers \n(relational objective) . Bundling relates to product \nor channel enrichment as a value-based objective . \nE-commerce players such as Cambo Quick and Fado168 \nact as bundlers of services . For instance, Cambo Quick \ndoes a number of things such as processing orders on \nAmazon, receiving goods to a US address and handling \nlogistics and applicable duties . The company makes \nmoney from such bundling (value-based objective) . \n\nManufacturers\u2019 agents\nShop168 acts as a manufacturers\u2019 agent . A \nmanufacturers\u2019 agent represents multiple sellers of \nspecific types of products and sometimes an entire \nindustry . Buyers are attracted because they can buy \nproducts from multiple manufacturers (relational \nobjective) . Shop168 helps established stores to put the \nproducts on its portal .\n\nIn this business model, financial improvement is the \nvalue-based objective, which means that the agent\u2019s \nmonetary benefits arise from user fees, advertising, and \nso on . The agent\u2019s revenues are either user-paid (e .g ., for \nWeb content, products, or services) or provider-paid (for \nexample, advertising revenues, commissions provided by \nsponsors, and the like) . Shop168 is a provider-paid agent . \n\nE-commerce in Cambodia\f5\n\nFacilitators of and \nBarriers to E-commerce \nin Cambodia\n\nsome other ASEAN members such as Myanmar (135) \nand the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic or Lao PDR \n(139), Cambodia is far behind more advanced ASEAN \neconomies such as Singapore (18), Brunei Darussalam \n(53), and Malaysia (63) . \n\nAs discussed in Chapter 2 of the main report, \ne-commerce facilitators and barriers can be analyzed \naccording to three dimensions of feedback systems: \neconomic, legal and institutional, and social acceptance \nand awareness (Kshetri 2007) . Table 2 presents \nkey barriers in Cambodia and some measures to \novercome\u00a0them . \n\nEconomic Factors and Conditions\n\nInformation and communication technology \ninfrastructure \nAs in other developing countries, many poor households \nin Cambodia are not in a position to buy hardware and \nsoftware and subscribe to internet services . Cambodia \nranked 128 out of 176 economies in the ITU\u2019s ICT \nDevelopment Index for 2017 . While it did better than \n\nThe most important barrier to developing the \ne-commerce market and industry in most developing \ncountries centers on low bandwidth availability . The \nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP) estimated Cambodia\u2019s \ninternational internet bandwidth at 30 gigabits per \nsecond (GBPS) in 2014 (Ruddy 2016) . This translates \nto 1 .90 megabits per second (MBPS) per 1,000 people, \nand is in line with Indonesia (2 .01 MBPS per 1,000 \npeople) and the Lao PDR (1 .92 MBPS per 1,000 people) . \nA lower bandwidth means that a longer time is needed \nto transfer data and hence the advantage of using the \nInternet is undermined . \n\nE-payment \nUnavailability of credit cards is also a major hurdle \nto realizing the economic benefits of e-commerce in \ndeveloping countries. As of 2017, the number of credit \n\nTable 2: Barriers to E-commerce in Cambodia and Measures to Overcome\n\nDimension \n\nEconomic \n\nExamples\n\nPossible ways to overcome barriers \n\n\u25cf Low credit card penetration \n\u25cf Lack of electricity supply\n\u25cf Low telecommunication density \n\u25cf Low purchasing power\n\u25cf Underdeveloped financial systems \n\u25cf Internet less attractive for traditional sectors such as \n\nagriculture\n\n\u25cf Lack of economies of scale \n\u25cf Limited access to ICT and other supporting infrastructure\n\n\u25cf Plan to develop blockchain-based payment system\n\u25cf Acceptance of diverse payment solutions\u2014such as cash \n\non-delivery, m-payment systems and credit cards\n\n\u25cf Development of m-payment systems with low transaction \n\ncosts\n\nLegal and \nInstitutional \n\n\u25cf Inadequate legal protection for internet purchases\n\u25cf Nonexistent or limited initiatives from industry bodies and \ntrade/professional associations to promote e-commerce\n\n\u25cf Cybercrime laws expected to be enacted soon\n\u25cf Policy advisory and advocacy from organizations such as \n\nMekong Business Initiative\n\n\u25cf E-commerce among the most important current policy \n\nSocial Acceptance \nand Awareness \n\nlanguage skills\n\n\u25cf General and computer illiteracy and lack of English \n\n\u25cf Cambodia Post eSolution expected to help local businesses \n\npriorities\n\nadopt e-commerce.\n\n\u25cf Business models of key players (e.g., WING) geared toward \nlow-end and technologically less sophisticated customers\n\n\u25cf Few local language websites \n\u25cf Lack of awareness and knowledge of e-commerce benefits\n\u25cf Low confidence in service providers\n\u25cf Lack of knowledge to use ICT profitably \n\u25cf High degree of risk aversion \n\u25cf Low degree of business confidence in e-commerce\n\u25cf Limited workforce with e-commerce expertise\n\u25cf Creating content in Khmer is complicated\n\nICT = information and communication technology.\nSource: ADB compilation based on Benang Merah Komunikasi (2017), Freischlad (2015a, 2015b), Hoffman and McVay (2013), Kshetri (2007), Luedi (2017), Ly et al. \n(2016), McGrath (2017), Schmitt and Orlov (2016), Sokhorng (2017), Sokunthea (2017), Ruddy (2016), Sovan (2015). \n\nE-commerce in Cambodia\f6\n\ncard users in Cambodia was about 60,000, or 0 .6% of \nthe adult population, according to World Bank\u2019s Global \nFindex Database 2017 . This is symptomatic of a broader \nproblem of financial exclusion . Also, only 17 .8% of adults \nin Cambodia have a bank account, lower than the 25 .6% \naverage among ASEAN\u2019s smaller economies (Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam) . \n\nSome developments are encouraging . The void in online \npayment is now being rapidly filled and new business \nmodels are emerging . Sites such as BookMeBus .\ncom allow both mobile\u00a0payment systems and credit \ncards (Hale 2016) . Cambodian mobile-phone-based \npayment system WING deserves discussion . Since \nstarting in 2009, WING has developed a network \nof agents through partnerships with microfinance \ninstitutions such as VisionFund and AMK, which have a \npresence throughout the country . In early 2017, WING \nhandled a monthly volume of transactions equivalent to \n50% of Cambodia\u2019s GDP (Sokunthea 2017) . The number \nof WING Xpress points reached 5,000 by the early 2018 \nand over 8,000 merchants accepted WING payments \n(Khmer Times 2018) . WING allows cellphone owners to \nsend funds to another cellphone number for deposit into \nthe receiver\u2019s WING account, or cash can be picked up \nat a physical WING station (Freischlad 2015a) .\n\nWING has lower transaction costs than alternatives . \nFor instance, whereas WING charges only $0 .50 to \ntransfer $100, customers pay between $1 and $5 for \nusing informal money-transfer services (Mylenko 2010) . \nIn 2012, WING started a service allowing customers not \nregistered with the company to send money to another \nunregistered customer . An agent receives the cash and \ntransfers by phone . The cash is paid out at the other \nend . In this way, a customer can transfer money without \nhaving a digital wallet (Hoffman and McVay 2013) .  \n \nLogistics\nLogistics challenges due to the lack of well-developed \ndelivery infrastructure are prominent barriers for \ndeveloping countries such as Cambodia . Indeed, \naccording to Cambodia Rapid eTrade Readiness \n(UNCTAD 2017b), problems mainly related to last mile \ndeliveries (from transportation hubs to homes), has \nhindered e-commerce growth . The report also noted \nthat \u201can ineffective and antiquated national postal \nsystem and a lack of a systemised address system\u201d \nseverely increase costs and time in delivering products \nbought online . For instance, if an item is to be delivered \n\nfrom a foreign country, it may take many weeks . The \nrecipients often need to go to the post office to find the \npackage . The country\u2019s post offices were reported to \narrange package with handwritten notebooks based on \nthe country of origin (UNCTAD 2017b) .\n\nCambodian companies are gearing up to respond to the \nunderdeveloped logistical infrastructure and services . \nExperiences from other developing countries suggest \nthat cheap labor is important to achieving low-cost \ndistribution (Kantar TNS 2016) . For instance, Alibaba \nrelies on freelance motorcycle couriers for delivery . \nCamboTicket, which was started in 2014 as an online \nbus-ticketing service, relies on similar solutions to sell to \ncustomers who cannot pay online . To collect payment, \nCamboTicket has partnered with a local food delivery \ncompany in Phnom Penh, which picks up cash from \ncustomers\u2019 homes (Moules 2016) .\n\nSome local companies are filling the logistics gap left by \nglobal e-commerce companies, making it possible for \nonline shoppers there to order from Amazon website \n(McGrath 2017) . One such company, Cambo Quick, \nprocesses orders on Amazon that need to be delivered \nto Cambodia . The company orders the goods to be \ndelivered to an address in the US . It handles next stage in \nthe logistics and applicable duties (which are not levied \non most goods valued at under $200 if for personal \nuse) . Orders collected over one week are consolidated \nand shipped to Viet Nam . From Viet Nam, the goods \nare delivered to Cambodia by bus . The total paid by a \nshopper equals Amazon\u2019s invoiced cost to deliver to the \nUS address plus international shipping costs (about $13 \nper kg) plus a 5% handling fee . The handling fee covers \ncustoms clearance, management and insurance, as well \nother costs . Orders of at least $25 are delivered without \nadditional costs in Phnom Penh . As of August 2017, \nCambo Quick was reported to handle about 300 orders \nper month, with increased demand during the holiday \nseason (McGrath 2017) .\n\nAnother company Fado168 operates a web portal and \nFacebook page, which delivers products ordered from \nAmazon\u2019s full catalog . An internet shopper can choose \nitems from the Fado168 website, or copy and paste a \nproduct\u2019s link from Amazon . Fado168 then sends a quote \nto the shopper for a delivery to a Cambodian address . \nThe normal delivery time is 10 to 20 days . As of August \n2017, Fado168 was reported to have handled over \n200,000 transactions . It accepts payments by WING, \n\nE-commerce in Cambodia\f7\n\ncredit card, bank transfer, or cash at its Phnom Penh \noffice (McGrath 2017) . \n\nIn light of concerns about the poor quality of the postal \nsystem, it is notable that Cambodia Post has teamed up \nwith Alibaba to deliver the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) e-commerce giant\u2019s products in Cambodia, \nserving as its agent since 2016 (Skyline University \nCollege 2017) .\n\nMany advanced applications on the horizon are likely \nto transform the Cambodian e-commerce landscape . \nA March 2017 article at Global Risk Insights (GRI), a \npublication for political risk news and analysis, reported \nthat Australian start-up Yojee was partnering with Post \nMedia and Cambodian delivery companies to offer \nadvanced delivery solutions (Luedi 2017) . Yojee utilizes \na crowdsourced platform to tackle delivery and logistical \nissues . Post Media is Cambodia\u2019s largest print media \nand news organization, which reaches over 1 .5 million \npeople . Post Media has warehouses a fleet of trucks and \nother assets required for delivery and logistics solutions \n(Proactive Investors 2017). Yojee\u2019s plan is to implement \nblockchain tracking technologies to offer same-day and \nnext-day delivery . Artificial intelligence would assign \ndrivers, routes, and workflow (Luedi 2017) .\n\nLack of economies of scale\nBarriers associated with the absence of economies \nof scale in small developing countries are widely \nrecognized . Kantar TNS Cambodia estimates the \npotential market size of most current e-commerce \nventures is in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 people \n(Gaudemar 2016) . One way to overcome this difficulty \nis to integrate with the broader ASEAN Economic \nCommunity (Benang Merah Komunikasi 2017) . \nHowever, the lack of resources, experience, and expertise \nwill hamper most Cambodian e-commerce players\u2019 \nattempts to internationalize their\u00a0businesses . \n\nLegal and Institutional Environment\n\nLegal and regulatory environment\nThe e-ASEAN Framework Agreement 2000, which \nwas signed by member States at the Fourth ASEAN \nInformal Summit held in Singapore, requires member \ncountries to enact e-commerce regulations . As of the \nmid-2014, Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and the Philippines \nwere the only ASEAN members lacking laws to govern \n\ne-commerce (Reaksmey 2014) . Since then, the Lao PDR \nand the Philippines have enacted laws to govern online \ntransactions . As of 2017, Cambodia was the only ASEAN \nmember without a law on electronic transactions (see \nAppendix Table \u00a0B .2 in the main report) . Whereas the \ncountry\u2019s e-commerce law was first drafted in 2008, as \nof the mid-2017, it had not been submitted for approval \n(Gaudemar 2017) . \n\nOn the regulatory front, the country\u2019s e-commerce is \ngoverned by a 1996 law dealing with postal services . \nUnclear laws on e-commerce and consumer protection \nare also among key barriers to the growth of e-commerce \n(Sokunthea 2017) . Some measures have been taken \nto reduce these barriers and e-commerce is among \nthe Cambodian government\u2019s most important policy \npriorities . For instance, the country\u2019s ICT Masterplan for \n2020 envisions building an \u201cICTopia Cambodia\u201d (Paro \n2014) and puts e-commerce among the priority actions \n(International Data Corporation 2016) . \n\nSocial Acceptance and\u00a0Awareness\n\nAs was discussed in Chapter 2 of the main report, factors \nsuch as awareness, knowledge, skills, and confidence \ncan serve as social acceptance and awareness feedback, \ndepending on nature of online buyers and sellers . Among \nthe key challenges in Cambodia are web illiteracy and \na general climate of suspicion toward the Internet and \nonline vendors (Eng and Pisey 2014) . Low confidence \nin e-commerce among businesses generally is also \na\u00a0challenge . \n\nOrganizations\u2019 confidence and knowledge \nabout e-commerce \nIn an organization, senior management\u2019s confidence \ninfluences the social acceptance and awareness of \ne-business . In developing countries, organizations\u2019 \nhuman, business, and technological resources, and \nlack of awareness and understanding of potential \nopportunities can lead to a negative assessment of \ne-commerce . Many Cambodian businesses have been \nreported to have little confidence in e-commerce \n(Benang Merah Komunikasi 2017). \n\nSome recent initiatives and actions on this front are \nencouraging . Coder Studio,  start up in Battambang City, \nprovides computer and mobile applications for small \nbusinesses . The company was founded in 2016 and \n\nE-commerce in Cambodia\f8\n\nemployed eight people by early 2017 (Luedi 2017) . As of \nMarch 2017, it was  expanding to Phnom Penh and Siem \nReap (Luedi 2017) .\n\nLikewise, in November 2017, the governments of \nCambodia and the PRC signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding to stimulate the development of the \nCambodian e-commerce industry and market . Its key \nprovisions included capacity building and personnel \ntraining in Cambodia (The Phnom Penh Post 2017) . \n\nConsumers\u2019 lack of awareness and knowledge \nof\u00a0e-commerce benefits \nOn the demand side, slow diffusion of e-commerce \nin developing countries can be attributed to lack of \nawareness and knowledge of e-commerce benefits \namong consumers and their lack of confidence in service \nproviders . As is the case of most developing countries, \nmany people in Cambodia are unaware of the benefits of \nthe Internet and e-commerce . Further, according to the \n2016 Human Development Report, the adult literacy rate \nof Cambodia was 77 .2% . The illiterate population is far \nfrom able to benefit from e-commerce . \n\nIt has been argued that the entry of big players will help \nincrease public awareness and improve customers\u2019 \nperception of the e-commerce market (Kimsay \n2017) . An example of an encouraging development \nis Cambodia Post having teamed up with the PRC \ncompany ZVS Investment and the local technology \ncompany Paxxa Mobile Solutions to start Cambodia \nPost eSolution . The new venture will develop a platform \nfor e-commerce and provide e-banking and online \ncourier services . The platform will also help people make \npayments to government organizations such as the Tax \nDepartment (Sokhorng 2017) . \n\nComputer illiteracy and lack \nof English-language skills \nAnother consideration with social acceptance and \nawareness barriers is related to general and computer \nilliteracy and lack of English-language skills, which \nincrease the perceived complexity of ICT uses in \ndeveloping countries. In Cambodia, a key barrier is that \ncreating content in the Khmer language is complicated \n(Freischlad 2015b) . \n\nEncouraging initiatives and efforts to address barriers \nrelated to the lack of Khmer content do exist, however . \nIn October 2014, Khmer Smart Keyboard was lauched \nas a free app that makes text input in Khmer faster \n(Vorajee 2015) . The digital media company Khmerload, \nwhich received a $200,000 investment from a Silicon \nValley-based venture capital firm and became the first \nCambodian company to receive such funding, is gaining \nprominence among high-profile companies to provide \ncontent in Khmer . Contents on Khmerload website \ninclude those related to sports, fashion, music, and \nlifestyle news (Goh and Jegarajah 2017) . Khmerload \nwebsite was reported to receive 4 .2 million unique \nvisitors per month . \n\nSome businesses have created effective solutions that \nmeet the needs of customers that are technologically \nless savvy . For instance, WING\u2019s business models \nare geared toward low-income customers who lack \nexperience with technology . These customers have been \nable to access mobile money and payments services \nthrough agents who deal with the technology and receive \nmoney for them (Hoffman and McVay 2013) .\n\nTrust and confidence in providers \nof\u00a0e-commerce and support services \nAnother key barrier is that many Cambodians have a \nlow level of trust in online outlets due to concerns that \nproducts provided by online companies may not be what \nare shown on their websites (Sovan 2015) . Due primarily \nto Cambodia\u2019s cash-based culture, many potential online \nbuyers are reported to be suspicious of making payments \nonline (Sokunthea 2017) .\n\nThe problems of trust in online businesses are further \nhighlighted when considering the wide availability of \nfake goods in Cambodia . Cambodian consumers are \ntherefore highly skeptical and suspicious of the quality \nof products sold both online and offline . One way to \novercome these challenges would be to offer product \nguarantees or exchange services . \n\nE-commerce in Cambodia\fE-commerce in the People\u2019s \nRepublic\u00a0of China\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe e-commerce market of the People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of China (PRC) has enjoyed a \nphenomenal growth over the past 15 years or \nso . In 2017, the PRC accounted for 40% of \nglobal retail e-commerce (Marinova 2017) . The PRC \ne-commerce market is already the biggest in the world . \nBy 2020, the PRC e-commerce market is expected to be \nbigger than those of France, Germany, Japan, the United \nKingdom, and the United States combined (Pilon 2017) . \nFor instance, total sales from the PRC\u2019s e-commerce \nmarket grew more than seven times to CNY23 .0 trillion \n($3 .6 trillion) in 2016 from CNY3 .2 trillion in 2008 .1 \nE-commerce retail sales rose even more in the same \nperiod\u2014by more than 40 times to CNY5 .3 trillion, from \nCNY130 billion .\n\nThe huge size and rapid growth of the PRC e-commerce \nmarket can be attributed to the country having the \nworld\u2019s biggest online population . As of 2017, 772 million \npeople were internet users in the PRC, accounting for \n21 .6% of internet users globally .2 Close to 70% of PRC\u2019s \ninternet users are online shoppers; this rate is as high as \n90% in top-tier cities (Wang 2016) .\n\nThe economic and social impacts of e-commerce have \nbeen widely reported . By the end of 2017, more than \n9 .8 million online shops were based in rural areas of \nthe PRC\u2014up 20 .7% from the previous year\u2014and had \ncreated over 28 million jobs (Xinhua 2018) .\n\nOverview of the PRC E-commerce \nIndustry and Market\n\nE-commerce has helped consumers deal with problems \nassociated with rapid urbanization . For instance, for \nconsumers who want to avoid traffic jams and parking \nfees, e-commerce is a reliable alternative . More and \nmore consumers in the PRC order food online (Marinova \n2017) . The country\u2019s online grocery penetration was \naround 4% in 2017 (Enterprise Innovation 2017) . \n\nM-commerce has been the main growth driver of \ne-commerce in the PRC (Marinova 2017) . However, \nmultidevice owners (e .g ., those with smartphones, \ntablets, and computers) have been reported to spend \n17% more on e-commerce than people who own only \nmobile devices . Multidevice owners also shop online \n29% more . They also interact 14% more with businesses \nthrough social networks such as WeChat accounts \n(Wang, Lau, and Gong 2016) . \n\nE-commerce companies are trying creative solutions . \nOnline-to-offline (O2O) commerce has been a popular \nbusiness strategy in the PRC . This involves attracting \ncustomers from online channels (e .g ., through e-mails \nand internet advertising) to shop in conventional stores . \nOne estimate suggests that about 71% of internet users \nin the PRC purchased O2O services in 2016 . In 2018, \nO2O services are expected to reach $100 .5 billion in \nannual sales (eMarketer 2016) . O2O businesses tend to \nattract price sensitive customers . Some companies have \nalso implemented self-pick-up strategies that shift more \nof the last-mile delivery costs to online buyers (Su 2016) .\n\nRefers to total sales from the PRC\u2019s e-commerce market, which \nincludes business-to-business transactions, retail sales, and group \nsales .

India is the second-largest with a share of 12% out of the total \ninternet users worldwide, based on ITU\u2019s 2016 figures . \n\nTable 3 presents major e-commerce players in the PRC, \nAlibaba Group and JD .com .

Table 4 presents \nrural\u2013urban divide in e-commerce . The country\u2019s rural \narea accounts for 41 .5% of the country\u2019s population but \nonly 36 .1% internet users . An even higher rural\u2013urban \ndisparity is seen in online spending . In the first quarter \nof 2015, less than 10% of purchases made on Alibaba\u2019s \ne-marketplaces were shipped to rural areas . \n\nIn the 36th China Internet Development Statistics \nReport, the China Internet Network Information Center \n(CINIC 2015)\u2014the administrative agency responsible \nfor internet affairs under the Ministry of Information \nIndustry\u2014identified two main challenges to developing \ne-commerce in rural areas: a small target market and \nlogistics difficulties . The first problem was largely due to \nmigration of young people to urban areas . It is often the \ncase that the elders and children that are left in the rural \nareas tend not to purchase online . Low incomes are an \nobvious factor that may explain the lower likelihood of \nrural communities to spend online . \n\nEstimates have put logistic costs in rural areas at \nfive times those in urban areas . Due to high logistics \ncosts, products from rural areas lose their price \ncompetitiveness when transported to big cities such as \nBeijing and Shanghai (Cui 2017) .\n\nTable 4: Rural\u2013Urban Divide in E-commerce\u2014People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\n\nPopulation, 2017 \n(% of national total)\n\nInternet users, 2017 \n(% of population)\n[% of national total]\n\nRural area\n\n576.6 million\n(41.5%)\n\n208.4 million\n(36.1%)\n[27.0%]\n\nOnline spending, 2016 \n(% of the nation\u2019s total)\n\n$131 billion\n(17.4%)\n\nUrban area\n\n813.5 million\n(58.5%)\n\n563.5 million\n(69.3%)\n[73.0%]\n\n$756 billion\n(82.6%)\n\nSources: CEIC Data China Premium Database (accessed 27 April 2018) and \nState Council, The People\u2019s Republic of China (2017).\n\nDespite these challenges, in recent years, rural \ncommunities in the PRC have increased their \nparticipation in e-commerce . An encouraging trend \nis the narrowing rural\u2013urban gaps\u00a0in business and \nindividuals\u2019 participation in e-commerce . E-commerce \nactivities are expanding from tier 1 cities to smaller cities \nand villages . \n\nAccording to the PRC Ministry of Commerce, for \nthe first time, in the second quarter of 2016,\u00a0online \nspending by the PRC\u2019s rural population, while still a small \nproportion of the national total increased by 13 .5%, faster \nthan that among the urban population (see Table\u00a04) . \nEven more encouraging was the 25% growth rate in \nsome\u00a0impoverished central and western regions (Xinhua \n2016b) .\u00a0According to the Ministry of Commerce\u2019s more \n\nE-commerce in the People\u2019s Republic of China\f11\n\nrecent data, in the first eight months of 2017, online retail \nspending in all impoverished regions increased by 55%, \nwhich was 17 percentage points higher than the average of \nall rural areas (State Council, PRC 2017) . \n\nMobile payment is reported to be more popular in the \neconomically less-developed western region (Kuo\u00a02017) . \nAmong factors encouraging e-commerce in rural areas are \nimprovements in rural broadband coverage, an increased \nrural focus of e-commerce platforms and partnerships \nwith villagers, improved rural logistics, and policy that \nencourages e-commerce (Cui 2017) . \n\nIn an attempt to stimulate the rural e-commerce market, \ne-commerce companies are putting more effort into \ndeveloping e-commerce and logistics infrastructure in \nrural areas . In October 2014, Alibaba announced a plan to \ninvest CNY10 billion ($1 .53 billion) in logistics, hardware, \nand training to develop e-commerce in the country\u2019s \n100,000 villages by 2019 (Teo 2015) . Rural service centers \nare a key element in this model . Their number increased \nfrom three in 2009 to 780 in 2016 . The plan is to build \n100,000 such centers and 1,000 county-level stations by \n2019 (Xinhua 2016a) . Such centers are usually located \nin villages\u2019 main convenience stores and are staffed by \nAlibaba representatives and equipped with computers \n(Cui 2017) . \n \nA Taobao village consists of a cluster of rural e-retailers \nthat sell products through Alibaba\u2019s Taobao marketplace . \nAnnual online sales in these villages exceed CNY10\u00a0million  \n($1 .5 million) . Over 10% of families in the village have \nonline shops (Cui 2017) . According to Ali Research, \none active Taobao village shop creates about 2 .8 jobs . \nBy August 2016, there were 1,311 Taobao villages in \n18\u00a0provinces and Taobao village shops had created over \n840,000 jobs (Cui 2017) . \n\nSocial Commerce\n\nSocial media websites are playing a key role in the \ne-commerce ecosystem . With about 1 billion users in \nits WeChat social messaging platform, Tencent has \nemerged as a powerful e-commerce player (see Table\u00a03) . \nFor instance, the e-marketplace JD .com is reported to \nnow get 30% of its new mobile shoppers from WeChat \nafter teaming up with Tencent in 2014 (Tong\u00a02017) . The \nproportion of WeChat users who shopped using the \nplatform doubled from 15% to 31% in 2016 (Mandel\u00a02017) . \n\nA user\u2019s social and payment information is connected \nthrough Tencent\u2019s unified user login . This allows retailers \nto better understand consumer behavior online and \noffline and to make personalized offers more effective . \n \nWhen a user downloads WeChat app on a cellphone, \nan embedded quick response (QR) code reader is also \ndownloaded . This can facilitate many O2O (offline-to-\nonline) services, such as scanning posters in subway \nstations, joining social networks, and making payments . \nBy scanning a business\u2019s QR code from a website or a \nphysical location, users can follow the business without \nhaving to fill a registration form (Lewis 2017) . \n \nBusinesses can register official WeChat accounts . By \nearly 2017, there were more than 8 million such accounts . \nUsing a WeChat official account, businesses can \nreach their followers . A businesses can send up to four \npromotional messages per month . In this way, WeChat \nhas become a CRM platform . By managing user profiles, \nit acts as an intermediary between businesses and \nconsumers (Lewis 2017) . A WeChat Pay plus account \nallows a business to accept payment from customers \nthrough the use of QR codes . This allows small retailers \nor even street vendors to accept payments through \nWeChat QR code reader on cell phones without needing \na dedicated point-of-sale terminal (Lewis 2017) . \n\nCross-border E-commerce\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, the PRC\u2019s cross-\nborder e-commerce network reached 220 countries in \n2016 . The PRC-based e-commerce companies are taking \ninitiatives to improve logistical processes in e-commerce \nexports . In 2016, Alibaba\u2019s logistics arm Cainiao teamed \nup with Lazada, Singapore Post, and cross-border \ne-commerce solutions provider 4PX Express to develop \na logistics network to link the PRC and Southeast Asia . \nBy November 2017, Cainiao had established over 16 \nwarehouses in Southeast Asia, reducing delivery time \nfrom 2 months to 2 weeks (Wenyu 2017) .\n\nAbout one-fifth of the online consumers bought goods \nfrom overseas vendors in 2016 (Wang, Lau, and Gong \n2016), rising to an estimated 23% in 2017 (eMarketer \n2017) . Average e-commerce spending per cross-border \ne-commerce buyer was estimated at $882 in 2017 \n(eMarketer 2017) . Cross-border shoppers tend to buy \nitems that are expensive or difficult to find in the PRC .\n\nE-commerce in the People\u2019s Republic of China\f12\n\nSome geographical differences exist in the PRC online \nconsumers\u2019 shopping from foreign websites . For \ninstance, shoppers in tier 1 cities often buy premium \nhealthcare products such as dietary supplements, \nmedicines, and medical instruments . These products \noften supplement local retailers\u2019 offerings . Consumers in \ntier 2 cities are reported to buy more luxury goods than \nother category of items from foreign vendors (Wang, \nLau, and Gong 2016) .\n\nOne estimate suggests that about two-thirds of the \nPRC\u2019s cross-border online consumers order through \nmajor PRC e-commerce websites\u2019 import channels \nsuch as Tmall Global and JD Worldwide (Research and \nMarkets 2017) . Shopping sites such as TMall Global, JD \nWorldwide, and Kaola are offering an increasing number \nof brands on their websites and improving cross-border \nlogistics and processing times (eMarketer 2017) .\n\nSome foreign companies, in collaboration with local \ne-commerce platforms, have created remarkably \nsophisticated business models to reach online \nconsumers in the PRC . In December 2017, US carmaker \nFord Motor announced a plan to sign a deal with Alibaba \nto test selling cars to PRC consumers through Tmall \n(Shirouzu 2017) . Ford could also use Tmall\u2019s so called \n\u201cAutomotive Vending Machine\u201c model to sell cars . This \nmodel involves a multistory parking garage resembling \na big vending machine . Consumers can browse through \nthe cars in store and test drive before buying . Consumer \nwith good credit can purchase a car with a 10% \ndownpayment and make monthly payments through \nAlipay (Shirouzu 2017) . \n\nFacilitators of and \nBarriers to E-commerce \nin the PRC\nEconomic Factors and Conditions \n\nInformation and communication technology \ninfrastructure \nIn August 2013, the State Council released the \n\u201cBroadband China\u201d initiative, which aims to expand \nfull broadband coverage across the country by 2020 . \nIn that year, urban broadband speeds are expected to \nreach 50\u00a0MBPS, while rural areas can expect speeds \n\nof 12\u00a0MBPS and broadband coverage in administrative \nvillages is expected to reach 98% . \n\nThe PRC government budgeted CNY1 .2 trillion (around \n$170 billion) for internet-related projects, mainly \nbroadband and mobile network improvement for 2017\u2013\n2020 (Xinhua 2017) . According to the ITU, the country\u2019s \nfixed broadband subscribers per 100 people reached \nabout 23 in 2016 . It is estimated that 92% of PRC mobile \nsubscribers will be converted to 3G/4G services by 2018 \n(Perez 2016) .\n\nE-payment \nDevelopment in the fintech industry arguably has \nbeen the key driver of e-commerce growth in the \nPRC (Hornblass 2016) . At the end of 2017, the PRC \nm-payment market was 11 times as big as the US market \n(Marinova 2017) . In the PRC e-commerce market, \ne-wallets accounted for 62% of payments in late 2017 . \nMost consumers use digital platform such as Alipay, \nTenpay, and WeChat Pay . Credit cards were used in 10% \nof transactions (Yu 2017) . Alipay was used by 68% of \nshoppers (He 2017) . Alipay and WeChat Pay together \naccount for around 94% of the mobile wallet ecosystem \nin the country (iResearch 2017) .\n\nAt a broader level, the evolution of m-payment culture \ndeserves mention . Online as well as offline buyers and \nsellers benefit from simple and efficient processes \nthrough all phases of e-commerce activity . For instance, \nAnt Financial and Tencent provide smaller vendors \nwith a simple printout of a QR code or provide it on \ntheir phones so that they do not need an expensive \ncard reader . A back-end system stores\u00a0a record of user \naccounts . That mean, there is no need to communicate \nwith a bank, which keeps costs down (Mozur 2017) . \n\nSince QR codes are free, they are a no-cost alternative to \npoint-of-sale terminals for small vendors . For instance, \nwith a few swipes of a phone, a customer can use an \ne-wallet to pay for groceries . The customer simply scans \na stallholder\u2019s QR code, enters the amount to pay, and \nshows the \u201cpayment confirmed\u201d screen to the seller .\n\nGeneral consumer and business finance companies in \nthe PRC have had limited success in serving the needs \nof economically active low-income families and micro-\nenterprises cost-effectively and sustainably . However, \nrecent advances in computing and telecommunication \ntechnology are transforming this landscape by \n\nE-commerce in the People\u2019s Republic of China\f13\n\nchanging the way the financial industry operates . \nA key mechanism concerns the use of big data in \nassessing, evaluating, and refining the creditworthiness \nof potential borrowers and reducing the transaction \ncosts . Major companies in the e-commerce value chain \nare using different categories of personal financial and \nnonfinancial information as proxies for a potential \nborrower\u2019s identity, ability to repay, and willingness \nto\u00a0repay . \n\nTencent\u2019s key strategy has been to make credits available \nto regular WeChat users to encourage them to shop at \nselected retailers . In 2013, WeChat introduced mobile \npay . In 2014, WeChat launched a system to exchange \nmoney electronically, based on the Chinese custom \nof giving red envelopes filled with money at special \noccasions such as weddings and holidays (Chao 2017) . \nThis dramatically increased the adoption of the WeChat \nWallet . By the end of 2014, over 100 million users\u2019 bank \ncards had been linked with Tencent\u2019s payment system \nthrough WeChat and QQ, the online messaging software \ndeveloped by Tencent (Yining 2015) . That number \nincreased to 300 million by early 2017 (Chao 2017) . \n\nAlibaba adopts a similar strategy . Its \u201cunified \nidentification\u201d has all the information users generate \nin their multiple businesses and platforms (The \nEconomist 2017a) . Alibaba uses big data to improve \nrisk management and control . Alibaba has developed \nits own credit ratings and risk control models based \non information about payments and e-commerce \ntransactions . It mainly utilizes its huge online ecosystem, \nwhich consisted of over 300 million registered users \nand 37 million small businesses on Alibaba Group \nmarketplaces, including Taobao and Tmall .com, early in \n2015 (Alibaba Group 2015) . \n\nThe low usage rate of e-payments is as much a problem \nof trust as of a lack of e-payment methods . In an attempt \nto fill the trust Alibaba launched Alipay in 2004 as a \nPayPal-type service (Lucas 2017) . Alipay was originally \ndeveloped for consumers to be protected when making \npayments on the Taobao e-commerce platform . During \nTaobao\u2019s early stage, widespread availability of poor \nquality products on its platform made it important to \nmitigate consumer concerns about fraud . An online \nshopper\u2019s money will not be transferred to the seller\u2019s \naccount until the consumer informs Alipay to do so . It \nguarantees that a customer will pay only when satisfied \nwith the product (Zhu 2014) .\n\nAn upshot of these developments is that online \nconsumers make far less use of cash-on-delivery \npayments . As Figure 1 makes clear, the share of cash-on-\ndelivery in the PRC e-commerce market is falling rapidly . \n\nLogistics\nThe logistics sector has achieved dramatic \nimprovements in recent years . For instance, the \ndelivery of 100 million packages for the PRC\u2019s Singles \nDay took nine days in 2013 and fell to 3 .5 days in 2016 \n(Woetzel\u00a02017) . \n\nA key factor in this respect is the role of the PRC\u2019s major \ne-commerce players . E-commerce accounts for more \nthan 70% of business for third-party logistics (3PLs) . \nPlayers such as Alibaba can therefore set industry \nstandards . They have also helped to stimulate price \ncompetition among last-mile providers (Ho 2017) . \n\nPRC-based e-commerce players have also made heavy \ninvestments in logistics technologies and companies . A \nnew big-data platform backed by Alibaba is connected \n\nFigure 1: Share of Cash-on-delivery Transactions in E-commerce Market\u2014People\u2019s Republic of China (%)\n\n$2.1bn\n\n70%\n\n$51.6bn\n\n30%\n\n$76.3bn\n\n22.1%\n\n$43.5bn\n\n9.7%\n\n2009\n$3bn\n\n2014\n$171.8bn\n\n2016\n$345.3bn\n\n2017f\n$448.9bn\n\nSource: eCommerce Worldwide (2017) for 2015 and 2016 data and Rauf (2014) for 2009 and 2014 data.\n\nCash on delivery\n\nOthers\n\nE-commerce in the People\u2019s Republic of China\f14\n\nto express-delivery companies which can process \n9\u00a0trillion lines of information every day and mobilize \n1 .7\u00a0million drivers (Woetzel 2017) .\n\nAlibaba holds a 51% stake in the delivery company \nCainiao, which shipped 55 million packages a day in 2017 \n(Handley 2017) . Based on real-time traffic information, \nCainiao\u2019s technology provides delivery drivers with the \nmost efficient delivery routes . Drivers can use the voice-\nactivated system to plan their deliveries . Cainiao\u2019s IT \nplatform integrates with Alipay and feeds logistics\u00a0details \nto consumers and other parties (Hornblass 2016) . \n\nSimilarly, JD .com has been building a logistics network to \ncover the entire country . By 2017, JD .com\u2019s 500 logistics \ncenters were expected to reach 600,000 villages \n(Wenjian 2017) . JD .com is also exploring advanced \nsolutions such as automated warehouses and unmanned \naerial vehicles to cut logistics costs and increase \nefficiency in rural areas . The company was reported to \nbe building two large drone delivery systems in Shanxi \nand Sichuan provinces (Wenjian 2017) . In June 2017, \nJD .com deployed robots to deliver items for the first \ntime . Delivery costs can be reduced from CNY7 .0 ($1 .0) \nper human delivery to CNY1 .5 ($0 .2) per robot delivery, \naccording to JD .com (Huang 2017) . \n\nLegal and Institutional Environment\n\nLegislative frameworks \nVarious legislative measures related to e-commerce have \nbeen taken . In November 2017, a second discussion \ndraft of the PRC E-Commerce Law was promulgated \nby the National People\u2019s Congress . The second draft \nstates that e-commerce companies must comply with \nthe cybersecurity law that took effect on June 1, 2017 . \nThe draft legislation classifies e-commerce companies \ninto three categories: (i) companies that engage in online \n\ntransactions on their own websites, (ii) e-commerce \nplatform operators, and (iii) stores that operate on \ne-commerce platforms . E-commerce platform operators \nwould be required to protect intellectual property \nrights\u00a0(IPR) . \n\nSocial Acceptance and Awareness\n\nGovernment initiatives have been implemented with the \nintention of improving social acceptance and awareness \nof e-commerce among businesses and consumers . Private \ncompanies are taking similar measures . For instance, \nAlibaba\u2019s Rural Taobao Program recruits Taobao partners \nand helpers . Taobao partners are paid a service fee to \nhelp farmers buy and sell products online . Taobao helpers \nprovide assistants to Taobao partners . By the mid-2016, \nRural Taobao had 18,000 partners and 8,000 helpers \n(Zhang 2016) . \n\nA 2013 survey of Alibaba indicated that 59% of online \nmerchants considered trust the largest barrier to the \ngrowth of online business in the PRC (Tong 2013) . \nThree ways to produce trust are: (i) process-based \ntrust from engagement in trustworthy relationships; \n(ii) characteristic-based trust generated by identifiable \nattributes that are linked with trustworthy behavior; and \n(iii) institution-based trust, which is linked to institutions \nsuch as trade associations, professions, and governments, \nand includes other formal mechanisms (Zucker 1986) . \n\nOne way to develop strong characteristic-based trust \nwould be to demonstrate positive consumer reviews and \nhigher sales volumes . Online vendors that do so are likely \nto be regarded as trustworthy . An Alizila blog noted that \nonline shoppers in the PRC are more likely than others to \nrely on buyer ratings and word of mouth to make purchase \ndecisions (Tong 2013) . \n\nE-commerce in the People\u2019s Republic of China\fE-commerce in \nthe Republic of Korea\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Republic of Korea is Asia and the Pacific\u2019s \n\nthird-largest (after the PRC and Japan) and \nthe world\u2019s seventh-largest retail e-commerce \nmarket (eMarketer 2015) . Government \n\nstatistics suggest the country\u2019s online shopping \ntransactions were worth KRW18 .2 trillion ($16 .7 billion) \nin the first quarter of 2017 (Retail Asia 2017) . According \nto the Bank of Korea, the country\u2019s B2C e-commerce \namounted KRW5 .5 trillion ($4 .84 billion) in May 2017, \nthe largest monthly figure since the central bank started \ntracking e-commerce in 2009 (S .W . Yoon 2017) . \n\nThe Republic of Korea e-commerce landscape pattern \nbroadly matches the global picture . For instance, as in \nother major economies, the most popular categories \nof items purchased online in the Republic of Korea are \nrelated to travel, clothes, and electronics . A unique \nfeature of the Republic of Korea e-commerce market is \nthat the share of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), \nmost notably grocery products, is much higher than \nin more mature markets such as France, the United \nKingdom, and the United States (Business Wire 2017a) . \nIn the first quarter of 2017, consumers in the Republic \nof Korea bought KRW2 .18 trillion ($1 .92 billion) worth \nof fresh produce online, which was 35 .6% higher than \nin the first quarter of 2016 (Retail Asia 2017) . In March \n2017, grocery shopping accounted for 11 .7% of online \npurchases (Retail Asia 2017) . \n\nOverview of the Republic of Korea \nE-commerce Industry and Market \n\nThe market research company eMarketer predicted that \nretail e-commerce, excluding travel, would account for \n15 .3% of total retail sales in 2017 (Chadha 2017) . An \nEconomist article publishedquoted research company \nEuromonitor as saying the Republic of Korea\u2019s online \n\nretail sales were 18% of total retail sales, the highest in \nthe world and significantly beyond the global average \nof 8 .5% (The Economist 2017b) . A study released in \nOctober 2017 reported that online retail sales accounted \nfor 20% of the total retail sales (Business Wire 2017b) . \n\nAs of 2016, 65% of internet users in the Republic of \nKorea shopped online . This proportion was the second \nhighest in Asia and the Pacific (Frederick 2016) only \nbehind Japan (66 .9%) (Cohen 2017) .\n\nKey E-commerce Players and their \nBusiness Models\n\nTable 5 shows some prominent e-commerce players \nin the Republic of Korea and key aspects of their \nbusiness models . Among the most notable features in \nthe table are that the Republic of Korea e-commerce \nproviders\u2019 business models emphasizes fast delivery \ntimes, especially for popular items . As of October 2016, \nWeMakePrice delivered 85% of goods in its \u201cdirect-buy\u201d \ncategory free of charge (Lee 2016) . \n\nThe quest for faster delivery has prompted the \ndevelopment of several innovative business models . \nIn particular, it has led to drastic changes in roles \nand responsibilities of different players in value \ndelivery networks (VDNs) . For instance, not long ago, \nWeMakePrice and other e-commerce vendors served \nas a platform linking businesses and consumers . The \ngoods were delivered to consumers directly from \nmanufacturers . In recent years, these sites have started \nbuying goods from vendors and storing them in their \nown warehouses . To realize larger margins, they sell and \ndeliver products in the direct-buy category (Lee 2016) . \n\nTo speed up deliveries, e-commerce vendors have \ndeveloped their own delivery systems . Coupang became \nthe first vendor to do so (see Table 5), offering what it \ncalls \u201cRocket Delivery\u201d in 2014 . In this way, the company \n\n\fTable 5: Some Key E-commerce Players in the Republic of Korea\n\nExplanation\n\nRemarks\n\n16\n\nCompany\n\n11Street\n\nG-Market (Gmarket.co.kr)\n\nTicketMonster (TMON)\n\nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s first \u201csocial\u201d e-commerce provider, \nlaunched in 2010.\n\nLocal hybrid of Amazon and eBay: offers clothing, jewelry, \ngroceries, electronics \u00a0 \n\nOffers points/mileage system \u00a0\n\nOffers international shipping and payments by Paypal\n\nFounded in 1999 as online auction website, sold to eBay in \n2009 for $1.2 billion. \u00a0\n\nWebsite available in English, Korean, and Chinese (viewed \nas a global yard sale/auction site) \u00a0\n\nDistribution of revenues: products (60%), travel (27%), \ngroceries (10%), local deals (3%)\n\nDedicated Hyundai Logistics team for deliveries.\n\nLaunched first mobile application in 2011.\n\n2014: 75% traffic from smartphones.\n\n2017: about 70% of sales through smartphones \n\nNo. 243 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Global 1000; sells \nwide range of products (700,000 retail items in 2016 \nranging from baby products to event tickets)\n\nSeptember 2017: 14 warehouses, plans to grow to 21% by \n2017 \u00a0\n\nNovember 2016: 11.3 million unique desktop visitors\n\nFebruary 2017: second most visited website by desktop \nusers (Nielsen KoreanClick): 10.9 million visitors, 34.2% \nreach. \n\n2016: transactions about KRW8 trillion ($7.1 billion).\n\nFebruary 2017: most desktop e-commerce traffic in the \nthe Republic of Korea (Nielsen KoreanClick), 11.1 million \nunique visitors, 34.8% reach. \n\nRanks first in average time spent per month\n\nApril 2017: 8.5 million consumers, 17% of the population. \n\nSeptember 2016: Super Delivery covered 8,000 daily-use \nitems sold directly.

It is clear from \n\nE-commerce in the Republic of Korea\fFigure 2: M-commerce and Internet Retail Spending \nPer Capita\u2014Republic of Korea ($)\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nM-commerce \n\nInternet retailing ($)\n\nSource: Kshetri (2018) using data from Euromonitor International. \nPassport\u00a0database.\n\nthe Euromonitor International data shown in Figure 2 \nthat the ratio of per capita m-commerce to per capita \ninternet retailing has increased . \n\nThe government organization for statistics, Statistics \nKorea (KOSTAT), noted that the annual value of online \ntransactions in 2014 reached $42 billion in 2014, of \nwhich mobile shopping was $13 .7 billion (Mamou \n2015) . This translated to an m-commerce to total \ne-commerce transactions ratio of 32 .6% . In December \n2016, m-commerce sales were KRW3 .487 trillion ($3 .08 \nbillion), while total B2C e-commerce was KRW6 .188 \ntrillion ($5 .47 billion) in the month (Clague 2017b) . \nThis means that m-commerce was 56 .3% of all B2C \ne-commerce in December 2016 . In the first quarter of \n2017, m-commerce as a proportion of total e-commerce \nreached 58 .6% (Retail Asia 2017) . \n\nIn the fresh produce category, m-commerce accounted \nfor 71 .1% of total online sales (KRW1 .55 trillion) in the \nfirst quarter of 2017 (Retail Asia 2017) . The Republic \nof Korea\u2019s consumers are more likely to buy food \nusing mobile phones than they are any other product \ncategory . Women in the country are more likely to use \nmobile phones to shop online than men . In 2015, 60% \nof all mobile-channel buyers were women (Hwang, \nMcInerney, and Shin 2015) . A study found that more \nthan 60% of the Republic of Korea\u2019s mobile shoppers \nreported convenience as the biggest reason for shopping \nonline . The proportion was 44% for online shoppers \nwho did not use their mobile phones to shop (Hwang, \nMcInerney, and Shin 2015) .\n\n17\n\nA number of e-commerce vendors have responded to \nthis trend by starting mobile-centric business models . \nGS Shop was reported to have a mobile-dedicated \nwarehouse and a mobile-specific call center to \nprovide specialized assistance with a single click . Many \nm-commerce players offer same of the next-day delivery \nfor most items (Hwang, McInerney, and Shin 2015) .\n\nOnline Groceries \n\nThe fast growth of the world\u2019s biggest online market for \ngrocery items is facilitated by the rapid and aggressive \nexpansion of fresh food delivery services by prominent \nRepublic of Korea e-commerce companies (see Table \n5) . Consumers can order online from a range of fresh \nfood suppliers . This factor, combined with the superfast \ndelivery, has brought increased convenience for \nconsumers (Retail Asia 2017) . \n\nDue to the increasing popularity of buying grocery online, \nfresh food represents some large e-commerce players \nhave created strategic business units to satisfy demand . \nSK Planet, the parent company of 11st (see Table 5), owns \nHello Nature, which offers superfast grocery deliveries . \n\nWoowa Brothers launched Baemin Fresh in February, \n2017 . Less than six months later the grocery store had \nover 240,000 users . Ticket Monster and WeMakePrice \nalso offer delivery services of fresh food items, which \nare supplied by their partners (Retail Asia 2017) . Some \nattribute the demand for fresh food deliveries to the \nrapid rise in the number of one-person households in the \ncountry (Retail Asia 2017) . \n\nIncreasing Market Maturity\n\nAs a sign of the maturity\u00a0of the Republic of Korea \ne-commerce market, consumers are demanding \nand asking for more information from e-retailers . \nAt cosmetics stores, most consumers check the \nmanufacture dates of products . The Republic of Korea \nlaw requires manufacturers to provide production \ninformation on the package . Since consumers could not \ncheck such information when buying online,  the Fair \nTrade Commission regulations were revised in 2012 to \nrequire online retailers to disclose details such as the \nproduction date, shelf life, original manufacturer, and the \ncountry where the product is manufactured (The Korea \nTimes 2013) . \n\nE-commerce in the Republic of Korea\f18\n\nAn outcome of e-commerce market maturity has seen \nthat players in the value chains have also displayed \nincreasingly cooperative behaviors .  Some companies \nhave revised their business strategies based on feedback \nfrom partners . Some e-commerce companies are taking \nmeasures to increase the involvement of value chain \npartners . For example, TMON teamed up with 12 travel \nagencies to make flights available through its search \nengine (Ramirez 2017) .\n\nCross-border E-commerce\n\nThe Republic of Korea is well-positioned to benefit from \ncross-border e-commerce . According to the Economist \nIntelligence Unit\u2019s (EIU) \u201cG20 e-trade readiness index\u201d \nreport published in 2014, the Republic of Korea ranked \nthe third most-prepared G20 economy to capitalize on \nglobal e-trade opportunities (EPROAD 2014) . \n\nThe Republic of Korea e-commerce industry has \nachieved substantial export growth . In 2016, foreign \nonline shoppers bought products worth $6 .22 billion \nfrom the Republic of Korea (China Internet Watch 2017) . \nOver that year, PRC online shoppers alone purchased \n$5 billion worth of goods from the Republic of Korea \n(Minter 2017) . The most popular categories were luxury \nitems such as cosmetics, clothing and accessories . \nIndeed, France and the Republic of Korea are the \nmost popular countries from which PRC consumers \nbuy beauty and skincare products (The Nielsen \nCompany\u00a02015) . \n \nStrong foreign demand for products from the Republic \nof Korea, especially in Asia, can be attributed to the \ncountry\u2019s growing influence in several areas, such as \npopular culture (pop stars, actors, and so on), beauty \nproducts, and music (Choudhury 2016) . About 8,000 \ncosmetic brands are made in the Republic of Korea, \nand frequently launches of new products keep up with \nconsumer preferences and stay ahead of demand . \nProducers also offer attractive pricing . \n\nThe PRC is a significant e-commerce export market \nfor the Republic of Korea . Many companies based in \nthe Republic of Korea are utilizing Tmall Global\u2019s Korea \nPavilion, which offers the Republic of Korea-based \nonline vendors a dedicated platform to sell to PRC \nconsumers (Weigland 2016b) . Tmall Global is Taobao \nTmall\u2019s international division, which provides products \nfrom international vendors to PRC consumers . Tmall \nGlobal has different pavilions for different countries . \nThe Republic of Korea was the first country to launch \na Tmall Global pavilion (Wang 2015) . As of 2016, over \n600 brands from the Republic of Korea had established \nonline stores on Tmall Global\u2019s Korean Pavilion \n(Weigand\u00a02016b) . \n\nIn 2016, the Republic of Korea\u2019s total e-commerce \nimports were worth $1 .6 billion (International Trade \nAdministration, US Department of Commerce) . Other \nAsian countries supplied 38% of online cross-border \npurchases in the Republic of Korea in 2015, while about \nhalf of the Republic of Korea online shoppers brought \nfrom abroad (Nothlichs 2017, Research and Markets \n2017) . Clothing is the most popular category for cross-\nborder online consumers from the Republic of Korea \n(Research and Markets 2017) . \n\nAccording to a 2014 report by New York-based \ne-commerce solutions provider Borderfree, the \nRepublic of Korea was considered to have a \u201cdesirable \nmarket\u201d status . The status was based in the Borderfree \nIndex (BFI), which uses quantitative and qualitative \nmeasures to assess a market\u2019s cross-border B2C \ne-commerce attractiveness (Business Wire 2014) . The \ncountry performed well in its\u00a0consumers\u2019 desire to buy \nfrom sources outside the country, and for income and \npurchasing power, the relative strength of its currency, \nand the ease of importing (GDS Link 2014) . \n\nE-commerce in the Republic of Korea\f19\n\nFacilitators of and \nBarriers to E-commerce \nin the Republic of Korea\nEconomic Factors and Conditions\n \nInformation and communication technology \ninfrastructure \nThe Republic of Korea has some of the world\u2019s best-\ndeveloped ICT infrastructure . According to the World \nBank, there were 2,201 secure internet servers per \n1\u00a0million people in 2016, which was the highest in \nAsia and the Pacific region . According to Euromonitor \nInternational, 78 .7% of households had at least \none smartphone in 2016 . The nation\u2019s smartphone \npenetration rate has reached 85% (Yonhap 2017b) . \n\nThe first LTE (also often called 4G) network was \nlaunched in 2011 . As of 2016, more than half of all \nmobile connections were on LTE (World Economic \nForum 2017) . A study of Akamai suggested that the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s mobile networks averaged 11 .2 MBPS \nby the third quarter of 2016 (Clague 2017b) . In terms \nof OpenSignal\u2019s availability metric, which tracked the \nproportion of time LTE users had access to a network, \nthe Republic of Korea led the world with an availability \nscore of 96 .4% . The average download connection speed \nwas 45 .9 MBPS and ranked second only to Singapore \n(46 .6 MBPS) (OpenSignal 2017) . In 2016, smartphone \nusers in the Republic of Korea consumed an average of \n4 .38 GB of mobile data per month, fourth in the world \nafter Finland, Austria, and Sweden (McCarthy 2017) . \n \nThe Republic of Korea government\u2019s policy priority \nhas been to establish an Ultra Broadband convergence \nNetwork (UBcN) with 1 GBPS speeds on fixed lines and \n10 MBPS on wireless . In the ITU\u2019s ICT Development \nIndex (IDI) for 2016, the Republic of Korea ranked first \nout of the 175 economies . According to the ITU, 92 .84% \nof the population used the Internet in 2016, which was \nthe highest proportion among all ADB regional members \nexcept Japan (93 .18%) . \n\nLogistics\nRapid growth of e-commerce in the United States can \nbe attributed to infrastructure developed by the catalog \nbusiness and an easy availability of delivery system . \nWhile the Republic of Korea has a relatively developed \n\ndelivery system, the existing system may not fully meet \nthe delivery speeds that e-commerce vendors and \nconsumers want . In the Republic of Korea, the average \npackage takes two to three days to arrive at a customer\u2019s \nhome (Mac 2016) . \n\nThe existing delivery system has been unable to meet \nthe needs of consumers who want superfast delivery . \nAs a result, many e-commerce players have their \nown delivery systems and are developing competitive \nadvantages based on fast delivery . \n\nE-payment \nAccording to a study by Payvision and  DHL, the \npreferred online payment method in the Republic of \nKorea is credit card (preferred by 73 .6%), followed \nby advance payment and debit cards (Mamou 2015) . \nConsumers\u2019 frequency of use and value of purchases \nwith credit cards in the Republic of Korea are among \nthe highest in the world . This can be attributed partly \nto government efforts to encourage credit card usage \nto reduce the size of the informal economy (Asian \nBanking and Finance 2017) . According to Euromonitor \nInternational, per capital credit card transactions in the \nRepublic of Korea totaled $10,413 in 2016, an amount \nexceeded only by Canada . \n\nBy mid-2017, the share of mobile payment services \nsuch as Samsung Pay was 1 .7% of the entire payment \nservice market (Choi  2017) . This is likely to increase as \nm-commerce gains popularity . \n\nSome e-commerce players have adopted social-media-\nbased payment solutions such as KakaoPay, offered by \nmessaging and communications app Kakao (Hwang, \nMcInerney, and Shin 2015) . Kakao provides users access \nto a wide range of day-to-day transactions, which is \ngradually eliminating the need for credit card (Wang \n2017) . As early as in 2014, 35 million people the Republic \nof Korea were reported to be using KakaoTalk (Singapore \nPost 2015) .\n\nSome payment providers have focused specifically on \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s cross-border transactions . In \n2016, PayEase partnered with the KG Incis to process \ncross-border transactions between PRC and the \nRepublic of Korea (Baziad 2016) . Likewise, in November \n2016, Althea collaborated with the Dutch payments \ncompany Adyen to offer more than 250 payment \noptions for merchants such as Indonesia\u2019s Mandiri \n\nE-commerce in the Republic of Korea\f20\n\nClickpay and the Philippines\u2019 GCash (Choudhury 2016) . \nAdyen\u2019s payment processing platform uses machine \nlearning that customizes payment methods based on the \nbuyer\u2019s location (Bullock 2017) .\n\nLegal and Institutional Environment\n\nLegal and regulatory environment\nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s cybersecurity laws are among \nthe most strict in the world . Following foreign hackers\u2019 \nalleged cyber-attacks in 2004, the Republic of Korea \nmade it mandatory for internet-related companies \nto report hacking incidents (Ho 2009) . The Republic \nof Korea enacted Electronic Transactions Act in \nDecember 1998 . The purpose of the act was to give \nelectronic and paper documents the same legal \nvalidity . The government enacted the law to create \na legally predictable electronic environment while \nprotecting consumer rights and implementing policies \nto promote e-commerce (Ministry of Information and \nCommunication, Republic of Korea 1999) . \n\nThe Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce \n(E-commerce Act) is the country\u2019s main law regulating \ne-commerce . This law requires e-retailers to comply \nwith various requirements in dealing with customers \nand fulfilling online transactions . For example, the \ninitial landing page must disclose a number mandatory \nitems related to contact information, tax registration, \nthe trade name of the hosting service provider, and a \nprivacy policy . In addition, product pages are required to \nhave relevant information under the Republic of Korea\u2019s \nE-Commerce Act, such as information on the goods and \nservices being offered , and the terms and conditions of \ncontract (Choi et al . 2015) . \n\nThe Network Act requires online retailers to make \ndisclosures to customers and obtain their consent \nwhen personal information is collected, used, or \ntransferred to other parties (Choi et al . 2015) . \nThe Personal Information Protection Act requires \norganizations to obtain data subjects\u2019 prior consent \nto export personal data .\u00a0Data subjects also need to be \ntold who receives their data, what the recipient will do \nwith the information, for how long it will be retained, \nand the specific personal information being exported \n(Cory\u00a02017) . \n\nIn June 2017, the government joined the Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation\u2019s voluntary cross-border privacy \nrules (CBPR) system . The system was developed in 2011 \nto facilitate e-commerce and protect the transfer of \npersonal information . Participation can strengthen the \nprotection of consumers\u2019 personal information . This is \nespecially important given the increasing tendency of \nconsumers in the Republic of Korea to engage in cross-\nborder e-commerce . Taking part in the CBPR means that \nif Republic of Korea consumers\u2019 data are leaked in other \nparticipating countries, the organization responsible for \nthe leakage may face a penalty . The punitive aspects \nof damage remedies can force companies dealing with \nconsumer data to take measures to protect privacy \nand to strengthen security . Foreign companies and \nconsumers are therefore likely to have more confidence \nin Republic of Korea companies\u2019 handling and protection \nof personal data (Trader 2017) .\n\nSome government measures that could spur \ne-commerce growth\nVarious government measures of the government \ncould directly or indirectly encourage e-commerce \ngrowth . The government already promotes awareness \nof cybersecurity risks among small and medium-sized \nenterprises and encourages cybersecurity-related \ninvestments . For instance, it provides tax incentives for \ncompanies that invest in cybersecurity-related products \nand services (OECD 2017) .\n \nGovernment initiatives have also been significant factors \nin the growth of SMEs\u2019 engagement in e-commerce \nexport initiatives . During the 2016H2, about 250 the \nRepublic of Korea small and medium-sized enterprises \ngained access to global markets through SK Planet\u2019s \ne-commerce platform 11st . This was possible thanks \nto SK Planet\u2019s partnership with the state-run Small \nand Medium Business Administration and the Large \nand Small Business Cooperation Foundation . SK \nPlanet operates its e-commerce platform 11st under \ndifferent names in foreign markets, such as elevenia \nin Indonesia and 11Street in Malaysia . It ran a Korean \nzone on the e-commerce website in each market \nand a zone for small and medium-sized enterprises \non its overseas e-commerce platform, which offered \nglobal delivery services and other support services \n(BusinessKorea\u00a02016) .\n\nE-commerce in the Republic of Korea\f21\n\nMeasures by trade associations \nand industry bodies \nTrade associations and industry bodies such as the Korea \nInternational Trade Association have taken initiatives to \nspur e-commerce growth . For instance, Tmall Global\u2019s \nKorea Pavilion was established in partnership with the \nassociation and the Korea Agro-Fisheries and Food \nTrade Corporation (Weigand 2016b) . In 2016, Tmall \nGlobal and KITA ran a one-day business workshop in \nSeoul in which more than 1,000 small and medium-sized \nenterprises participated (Weigand 2016a) . \n\nSocial Acceptance \nand Awareness\n\nOrganizational readiness \nThe sophisticated business models and practices of \ne-commerce companies discussed above are not \nrepresentative of all companies in the Republic of Korea . \nthe challenges the Republic of Korea-based companies \nface are organizational and relating to social acceptance \nand awareness, rather than technical according to \nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD) although there is still room for \nimprovement for companies to use advanced digital \ntools to take advantage of business opportunities . \nAlthough nearly all companies in the Republic of Korea \nhave a broadband connection, their advanced and \nproductivity enhancing technologies are far from fully \nutilized, the OECD noted . The OECD recommended \nthat companies in the Republic of Korea make a deeper \nand wider use of customer relationship management and \nbig data analytic tools (OECD 2017) . \n\nStrong cybersecurity and the ability to protect consumer \ninformation are tightly linked to organizational readiness \nto benefit from the digital economy . In this regard, \ncompanies in the Republic of Korea have performed well . \nAccording to a 2016 survey, 90% of businesses in the \nRepublic of Korea used information security products \nand 41% used information security services (Ministry \nof Science, ICT, and Future Planning 2016, Korea \nInternet and Security Agency 2016) . These measures \n\nhave resulted in Republic of Korea enterprises having \nthe lowest incidence of cybersecurity breaches among \nOECD countries, with 4% of companies  experiencing \nbreaches (OECD 2017) . \n\nHowever, the Republic of Korea enterprises have \nperformed relatively poorly in protecting the privacy \nof consumer data . The proportion of individuals \nexperiencing privacy violations was 7% in 2015, which \nwas higher than most other OECD countries (Yonhap \n2017c) . Unsurprisingly, in a 2017 survey commissioned \nby Veritas Technologies, the Republic of Korea was \namong the least-prepared countries to adopt the GDPR \nstandards (Veritas 2017) . Compliance with the GDPR, \nrequires that organizations have greater oversight and \ncontrol over where and how personal data is stored and \ntransferred . Access to personal data also needs to be \nrigorously policed and audited . \n\nConsumer perception, experience, \nand expectations\nMost consumers in the Republic of Korea value \nconvenience over cost . It has been argued that the rapid \ngrowth in online grocery shopping is associated with \ngrowth in single-person households and double-income \nfamilies . In September 2016, one-person households in \nthe Republic of Korea accounted for about 35% of the \npopulation . These people often face time constraints for \nshopping at a supermarket and are willing to spend more \nif they order grocery products online (Retail Asia 2017) .\n\nSocial acceptance and awareness factors are also \nlinked to the consumers\u2019 strong tendency to purchase \nproducts online from foreign vendors . Republic of Korea \nconsumers are reported to have a more positive attitude \ntoward buying products online from foreign countries \nthan consumers in some other economies . For instance, \na survey conducted by DHL Global Mail indicated \nthat only a third of the country\u2019s consumers expressed \nnegative attitudes about placing orders with a foreign \nsupplier (DHL Global Mail 2013) . \n\nE-commerce in the Republic of Korea\f22\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAlibaba Group . 2015 .

In an \ninterview, Eelco Dijkhuizen, general manager of Kantar \nTNS Cambodia, noted that the real value proposition \nof e-commerce in Cambodia is that consumers can buy \nproducts that are often not available in regular retail \noutlets .
