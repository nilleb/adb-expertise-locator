Introduction \n \nIdeally, statistics on the goods traded between two countries should be captured by each \nside\u2019s respective customs office. Country A\u2019s recorded exports to Country B should be \nidentical to Country B\u2019s recorded imports from Country A (mirror statistics). While there \nmay be some discrepancies caused by errors and statistical methodology differences \nbetween the two authorities, we should expect that the two sides of the mirror statistics \nare more or less similar.  \n \nHowever, in reality the two sides of the mirror statistics are often very different; at best, \nlike a reflection on the surface of a puddle. This is especially true for trade statistics \ncompiled by developing countries. Various factors cause discrepancies in both the value \nand quantity of trade recorded. The first possibility is that the customs offices of the two \nsides record the same quantity but at different values. In this case, the difference is \nlimited to price. The second possibility is that the two customs offices record different \nquantities as well. Differences in quantity can be caused by transshipment. There is also \nthe possibility of customs offices committing human errors leading to misclassification, \nas well as the effects of smuggling by traders.    \n \nThe general view on the accuracy of data collected by customs offices is that import data \nare  more  reliable  than  export  data  because  governments  are  more  serious  about \nrecording imported goods for purposes of tariff revenue collection, taxes, and other \nregulatory controls. This could also be the case with regard to direction classification as \ncustoms officers carefully examine the origin of imports because the relevant amount of \ntariffs they need to collect is determined based on the good\u2019s origin, while they are \ngenerally less interested in the recipient country of exported goods. At the same time, \nhowever, traders may have an incentive to under-report the value of imported goods to \navoid paying tariffs.1  \n \nThis paper assesses the quality of Cambodian trade statistics by utilizing the mirror \ntechnique  and  studies  the  magnitude  of  the  misclassification  problem.2  It  focuses \nspecifically on the inaccuracy of trade statistics caused by two types of misclassification: \ncommodity misclassification and direction misclassification. We will thoroughly examine \nproducts that are misclassified as different (but similar) products and products to or from \na particular country that are misclassified as products to or from another country. In \ndoing so, we will move beyond a simple comparison between import and export data at \nthe aggregated or disaggregated level in existing research.  \n \nThe structure of the paper is as follows. The next section reviews existing empirical \nstudies on sources of discrepancy between mirror data, as well as literature on the \ncomparison of mirror statistics. Bearing in mind the methodological weakness of existing \nstudies, the third section explains the methodology used in this paper, \u201cmultiple mirror \ntechnique,\u201d which is suitable to assess the quality of trade statistics. The fourth and fifth \nsections analyze the quality of export and import statistics of Cambodia, respectively. \n                                                 \n1  The value of exports can also be manipulated (in this case through over-invoicing) as a way to misuse \nduty drawbacks. \n2  For the quality assessment of trade statistics of Lao PDR, see Hamanaka (2011).  \n ", "2   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \nThe final section summarizes the empirical findings of this paper and considers the \nimplications for other transitional economies.  \n \n \n2.   Literature on Discrepancies in Mirror Data and the \nAccuracy of Trade Data \n \n2.1.   Source of Discrepancies in Mirror Data  \n \nVarious factors can lead to discrepancies in mirror statistics (Yeats 1995, Makhoul and \nOtterstorm 1998, Ferrantino and Wang 2008, Eurostat 2009). While the focus of this \npaper is on misclassifications associated with commodities and the direction of trade, \nwhich  are  mainly  incurred  by  customs  offices  (of  either  the  exporting  or  importing \ncountry),3 it is important to understand factors aside from misclassifications that cause \ndiscrepancies among mirror statistics (Table 1).  \n \nFirst, differences in reporting costs cause discrepancies because exports are mostly \nreported  on  a  free  on  board  (FOB)  basis,4  while  imports  are  reported  on  a  costs, \ninsurance, and freight (CIF) basis. The CIF\u2013FOB differences may result in a higher \nimport value than export value. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that on \naverage, the CIF price is larger than the FOB price by 10%.5 However, the CIF\u2013FOB \nratio becomes larger as the distance between trade partners increases and the weight of \nthe traded goods becomes heavier (Pomfret and Sourdin 2009).  \n \nSecond, the exchange rate is another contributing factor to differences in cost reporting, \nmaking it difficult to predict which side of the mirror data will have a higher value. The \ncustoms office may set its own exchange rate for conversion purposes, such as the \nmonthly average rate, which may not necessarily coincide with the market rate at the \ntime the goods are actually traded. Moreover, the exchange rates used by the two \ncustoms offices may differ.  \n \nThird,  the  difference  in  timing  is  presumed  to  be  a  cause  of  discrepancy  in  some \ninstances when exports leave the port of origin during the last month of the year and \narrive at the port of destination the next year. Although this factor is prominent when we \nanalyze monthly data, it becomes marginal when we use annual data. If trade has a \ngrowing trend and the time lag between export and import timing is significant, the export \nvalue will be larger than the import value for that period. \n \n                                                 \n3  While traders are considered the immediate party that commits errors (e.g., misreporting traded goods), \nwe regard this as a misclassification committed on the part of the customs office since it is responsible \nfor ensuring that data submitted by traders are accurate.   \n4  Exports are sometimes reported on a free alongside ship (FAS) basis, which equals FOB minus the \ncost of loading the ship. \n5  To estimate a mirror export, the partner country's import value is divided by 1.1. The detailed estimation \nprocedure  is  discussed  on  the  IMF\u2019s  Direction  of  Trade  Statistics  website  at \nhttp://www2.imfstatistics.org/DOT/DOTEstim.htm \n ", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   3 \nFourth, the coverage of goods recorded by customs offices in the importing and the \nexporting country is not always the same; there are structural differences between the \ntwo that can lead to discrepancies in trade statistics. Even if neither party commits any \nerrors in recording the origin or destination of the goods, the discrepancy may occur \nbecause the trade partners\u2019 customs offices subscribe to different rules of origin since \nthere  is  no  universal  rule  on  specifying  the  origin  and  destination  of  goods.  The \ndetermination of the origin of re-exports6 or transshipped goods7 is particularly important \nin this regard. In addition, trade to and from free trade zones is another issue that \nproduces differences in coverage. Countries with different trading systems, whether \ngeneral or special, will have different coverage of recorded transactions because the \nformer includes all transactions in the free trade zone while the latter does not include \nsuch transactions.8 Finally, goods that are already recorded as imports but are returned \nto the exporting country for any reason will not be recorded by the intended importing \ncountry but will continue to be in the record of the exporting country.  \n \nFifth, traders sometimes deliberately make false declarations of the value of the goods \nor the origin and/or destination of goods in order to take advantage of duty reductions or \nthe duty drawback scheme. For example, traders might declare an inflated value for \nexports (over-invoicing) in order to take advantage of the duty drawback program.9 \nWhen this happens, the value of the export side of the reporting country becomes larger \nthan that of the import side of the partner country. 10 Another common practice is tariff \nevasion by under-reporting the import value. Transfer pricing is also a common practice \nto avoid various tariffs and duties (e.g., domestic taxes) that is engaged in by related \nparties in different countries, such as different branches of a multinational corporation. \nThis practice shifts profits from high-tax countries to low-tax countries (Ferrantino and \nWang 2008).  \n \nFinally, misclassification by customs offices, which is the focus of this paper, is also a \ncritical factor in determining discrepancies observed among mirror data. There are two \nkinds of trade misclassification. Commodity misclassification is the faulty recording of the \nsame  good  under  different  commodity  codes  by  either  the  exporting  or  importing \ncountry's customs office. The presumption is that misclassification may occur among \n                                                 \n6  Re-export takes place when goods enter a customs territory from one country and are shipped to \nanother country without being modified. \n7  Transshipment, or \"goods in transit,\" includes merchandise that passes through ports but is not \nunloaded from the ship or aircraft. \n8  The general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its economic \nterritory. The special trade system (strict definition) is in use when the statistical territory comprises only \nthe free circulation area, that is, the area within which goods \"may be disposed of without customs \nrestriction.\" The special trade system (relaxed definition) is in use when (i) goods that enter a country for \nor leave it after inward processing and (ii) goods that enter or leave an industrial free zone are also \nrecorded  and  included  in  international  merchandise  trade  statistics  based  on  the  International \nMerchandise Trade Statistics Concepts and Definitions. United Nations. Series M, No. 52, Revision 2. \nSee Eurostat (2009).  \n9  Using mirror trade data, Mahmood and Azhar (2001) hypothesized the presence of over-invoicing of \nexports in Pakistan due to the duty drawback incentive scheme. The study found that there is a strong \npresence of over-invoicing across various trade partners and products.  \n10  Javorcik and Narciso (2007) found that the discrepancy between the value of exports reported by \nGermany and the value of imports reported by Germany\u2019s trade partners is positively related to the level \nof tariffs in 8 out of 10 countries surveyed. \n ", "4   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \ntraded  goods  whose  commodity  descriptions  or  names  are  somewhat  similar. \nOftentimes, it is difficult to trace which side, importer or exporter, commits the error in \nmisclassification, thereby making the discrepancies in trade statistics immeasurable and \nunpredictable. \n \nDirection misclassification is associated with attributing the origin of traded goods to the \nwrong country. This problem is prominent in the case of re-exports or transshipments. \nFor example, suppose that goods originating from Country A pass through Country B \nbefore reaching the final destination, Country C. The origin country (Country A) may \nrecord goods as exports to either Country B or C. Country C may record the goods as \nimports from either Country B or A. And the transit country (Country B) may record the \ngoods as imports from Country A and exports to Country C, re-exports to Country C, or \nperhaps the transit country does not record anything at all. Again, even if there is a \ndiscrepancy, it is difficult to determine which country\u2019s customs office (A, B, or C) has the \ncorrect record. \n \nTable 1: Causes of Discrepancies between Mirror Data \n \nChange in Price \nFactors  Causes \nand/or Quantity \nUnavoidable factors  FOB\u2013CIF difference  Price \n\u2022  freight cost \n\u2022  insurance costs \nStructural differences between  Coverage  Quantity \ntwo customs offices  \u2022  differences in rules of origin \n(especially in the cases of re-export) \n\u2022  processing zone \n\u2022  returned goods \nTime lag  Quantity \nExchange rate  Price \nDeliberate misreporting by  False declaration of value by traders Quantity and Price \ntraders and errors committed by \nFalse declaration of origin by traders Quantity \ncustoms offices \nCommodity misclassification by customs  Quantity \nDirection misclassification by customs  Quantity \nSource: Author\u2019s compilation. \n \nFederico  and  Tena  (1991)  classified  these  factors  into  three  groups\u2014unavoidable \nfactors, structural differences, and human errors and deliberate misreporting (Table 1). \nThe CIF\u2013FOB difference is classified as an unavoidable factor because the inclusion of \nfreight costs in the import price, but not in the export price, is a factor in causing \ndiscrepancies. Second, structural differences include differences in coverage between \nthe two customs offices, a time lag factor, and exchange rate fluctuations since these \nare associated with differences in the policy decisions of each customs office. Finally, \nhuman  factors  are  also  critical  determinants  of  the  discrepancy  in  mirror  statistics. \nDeliberate misreporting by traders includes false declaration of both price and quantity \n ", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   5 \n(and thus value). Traders face the incentive to manipulate goods classification as well as \nclassification of origin and destination in order to avoid duties. Errors committed by \ncustoms offices are also critical and these fall under both direction misclassification and \ncommodity misclassification. \n \n2.2.   Literature on the Comparison of Mirrors  \n \nThe existing literature on the comparison of mirror statistics can be classified into two \ngroups based on the type of data used. The first group of literature directly compares \nCounty X\u2019s CIF import from (FOB export to) Country Y against Country Y\u2019s FOB export \nto (CIF import from) Country X, both at the aggregate and bilateral levels. Using pre-\nWorld War II data of the major trading countries, Federico and Tena (1991) find that the \ntotal of a country\u2019s exports (imports) basically matches the total of its trade partners\u2019 \nimports from (exports to) that country.  \n \nHowever, the assessment of the total sum employed by Federico and Tena (1991) may \ndisguise various discrepancies at the disaggregated level in terms of both directions and \ncommodities (over-estimation and under-estimation) that cancel each other out at the \naggregate level. Thus, there is a possibility that the discrepancy at the total level would \nbe small even when there are large discrepancies observable at the disaggregated level. \nAccordingly, Makhoul and Otterstorm (1998) calculated the discrepancies of an over-\nestimation group and that of an under-estimation group separately, and checked if the \nsatisfactory  result  at  the  aggregated  level  is  due  to  canceling  out  effects.  Their \nconclusion  is  that  these  effects  are  large  and  the  discrepancy  between  mirrors  is \nsignificant at the disaggregated level.  \n \nMeanwhile, Yeats (1995) compared developing countries\u2019 total export\u2013import values \nagainst the sum of the rest of the world\u2019s import\u2013export values through trade with them.  \nHe finds that the mirror method is inadequate in estimating the missing trade data of \ndeveloping countries; this is especially true at the disaggregated level. This finding is \nimportant because the discrepancy is large even at the aggregate level (of all trade \npartners), where we can otherwise ignore direction factors, implying that a miscoding of \ndata is persistent.  \n \nThe weakness of the first group of literature is that it is difficult to separate discrepancies \ncaused by reasonable factors such as transport costs from the so-called noise, which \nincludes  discrepancies  associated  with  human  errors  such  as  misclassifications. \nAccordingly, this group of literature tends to focus on whether the discrepancy is large or \nsmall. It simply measures the size of discrepancies and then lists down possible factors \nto explain the discrepancies without analyzing the impact of each factor. The literature \nseldom discusses whether the discrepancy is caused by reasonable CIF\u2013FOB factors or \nother reasons, despite the fact that the discrepancy between the two sides of the mirror \ndata stems not only from price factors, including the CIF\u2013FOB difference, but also \nbecause quantities are different. So long as we compare only CIF import values and \nFOB export values compiled by different customs offices, separating the two (CIF\u2013FOB \nfactor and other factors) will remain extremely difficult.   \n \n ", "6   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \nSeveral customs offices collect, compile, and release import data on a FOB basis in \naddition to a CIF basis.11 The FOB import data is said to be a more accurate partner of \nCIF import data, as opposed to the mirror data, because they originate from the same \ncustoms office. Using FOB import data, we can conduct a better analysis on the quality \nof a trade partner\u2019s FOB export data. The fundamental problem of the first group of \nliterature  (reasonable  price  factor  versus  others)  can  thus  be  solved  to  a  degree \nbecause the difference between CIF and FOB import values from one customs office \napproximates transport costs.12   \n \nEmploying  matched  US  and  partner  country  trade  data,  Yeats  (1978)  attempted  to \nseparate the observed variations in FOB export\u2013CIF import statistics into freight costs \nand discrepancies caused by other factors (residual) using FOB import data.13 He finds \nthat the residual becomes larger and the discrepancy of the mirror becomes significant \nwhen  we  use  lower  digit  commodity-level  data.  This  implies  that  commodity \nmisclassification is a serious problem in customs offices in developing countries.  \n   \nHummels  and  Lugovskyy  (2006)  compare  the  two  kinds  of  discrepancies:  (i)  the \ndiscrepancy between CIF-based bilateral imports and FOB-based bilateral imports, and \n(ii) the discrepancy between CIF-based bilateral imports collected by the import side and \nFOB-based bilateral exports collected by the exporting side. Their conclusion is that the \ndiscrepancy between matched partner trade statistics (a certain country\u2019s CIF-based \nimports and its partner\u2019s FOB-based exports) is significant and includes not only trade or \ntransport costs but also various noises associated with structural factors as well as \nhuman factors.  \n \nThe fundamental methodological problem common to both groups of literature is that \nbased on a single bilateral mirror comparison, we cannot conclude which customs office, \nwhether the exporting or the importing side, is the source of the discrepancy. Ultimately, \nit is difficult to assert which side of the statistics is inaccurate. Even if some studies were \nable to establish that a discrepancy that is not caused by reasonable factors, such as \ntransport  costs,  is  significant,  we  cannot  conclude  which  side  produced  such  a \ndiscrepancy.  This  is  because  the  existing  literature\u2019s  focus  is  limited  to  bilateral \ncomparisons. A method to overcome this problem will be explained in the next section. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11  These include the US, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and Chile.  \n12  Using FOB and CIF import data released by the same customs office, researchers can concentrate on \nthe FOB\u2013CIF difference and examine trade or transport costs, and ignore quantity discrepancies when \nusing data from one source only. However, this type of study may no longer be called mirror analysis \nbecause the trade data being used is compiled by only one customs office. It has been stated that the \nFOB\u2013CIF difference becomes large when the goods being traded are heavy and when the distance \nbetween the two trade partners is great. Nevertheless, a large portion of the difference still remains \ninsufficiently explained (Pomfret and Sourdin 2009).   \n13  Freight costs can be calculated as the difference between FOB-based export data and CIF-based \nimport data (both data are collected by the US). The difference between the FOB export\u2013CIF import \nvariation and the calculated freight cost is the residual. \n ", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   7 \n3.   Methodology of Multiple Mirror Comparison  \n \nThis paper assesses the quality of trade statistics by comparing a test country\u2019s trade \ndata against its trade partners\u2019 data. Countries that publish FOB-based import data do \nnot necessarily provide us with an ideal benchmark to test the quality of Cambodian \ntrade statistics for several reasons.14 This study belongs to the first group of literature \nexplained  in  the  previous  section.  Accordingly,  it  has  an  inherent  methodological \nproblem. That is, the discrepancy between the mirrors also includes the variation caused \nby reasonable factors, such as the CIF\u2013FOB gap. In order to avoid this problem, the \nstudy focuses on commodity groups that have significantly large discrepancies that \ncannot be attributed solely to price factors.  \n \nAs we have seen, we cannot conclude which side\u2019s statistics (importer or exporter) are \ninaccurate, even if we are able to establish that the discrepancy is large, so long as the \nanalysis  is  limited  to  a  single  bilateral  mirror  comparison.  A  single  bilateral  mirror \ncomparison, which is common in the existing literature, does not tell us much about the \nmanner in which misclassifications are committed. In order to overcome this, we need to \ncompare  the  results  of  various  bilateral  mirror  analyses  of  trade  statistics  (multiple \nmirrors comparison).  \n \nThis section first explains the definition of the import\u2013export ratio and two concepts of \nasymmetric commodity groups.

There are \ntwo  types  of  asymmetric  commodity  groups:  \u201cno  reported  data  on  one  side\u201d  and \n\u201cextremely large discrepancy,\u201d which can either be positive or negative.  \n \nNo reported data on one side of the mirror. We consider this an important indicator of \nmisclassification regardless of the size of the figure on the other side because \u201cno data\u201d \nimplies that the customs office either did not record the trade transaction or recorded the \ntransaction but under a different commodity classification than that of the partner. The \nlack  of  reported  export  (import)  on  only  one  side  of  the  mirror  reflects  possible \nmisclassification. That is, the goods could have been accounted for by the customs \noffice but were possibly classified under commodity codes different from the commodity \ncodes under which the partner recorded such goods.  \n \nExtremely large discrepancy. Tariff lines or commodities that satisfy the two conditions \ndetailed  below  are  regarded  as  asymmetric  tariff  lines  with  an  extremely  large \ndiscrepancy. First, the 2-digit level discrepancy ratio (see formula above) should either \nbe  higher  than  2.0  or  lower  than  0.5.  Taking  into  account  the  acceptable  level  of \ndiscrepancy attributed to the CIF\u2013FOB factor discussed above (imports exceed exports \nby  10%  or  more),  a  ratio  of  more  than  2.0  and  less  than  0.5  can  be  considered \nsignificant. Second, we introduce the concept of the absolute size of discrepancy and \nregard the tariff line as asymmetric between the two sides of the mirror when the \ndiscrepancy is greater than a certain threshold, which changes depending on the size of \ntrade. In order to calculate the threshold for each 2-digit commodity code, we first \ncalculate the average aggregate bilateral trade value using both sides of the mirror \ndata.15  Based  on  this  averaged  aggregate  bilateral  trade  value,  we  compute  a \ntheoretically reasonable value of trade at each 2-digit level, which is 1% of aggregate \nbilateral trade.16 The threshold employed is 10% of this theoretically reasonable amount \nof each 2-digit commodity.17 In short, when the import\u2013export ratio is higher than 2.0 or \nlower than 0.5, and the absolute difference is larger than the threshold mentioned above, \nwe regard that such a commodity group has an extremely large discrepancy.  \n \nAveraged bilateral trade at the aggregate level \n= A test country\u2019s aggregate trade with a partner + the partner\u2019s aggregate trade with \na test country / 2 \n \n                                                 \n15  For example, when Country A's imports from Country B are USD45 trillion (Country A\u2019s data) and \nCountry B's exports to Country A are USD55 trillion (Country B data), the average value of the \naggregate bilateral trade becomes USD50 trillion.  \n16  1% is used because there are roughly 100 2-digit commodity groups. While there are actually 97 groups \nand 1 group that includes goods not classified elsewhere (No. 99), 1% is used for ease of calculation. In \nthe above example, the theoretically reasonable amount of each 2-digit trade volume is USD500 million. \n17  10% is used because the discrepancy within 10% should be considered normal given the CIF\u2013FOB \nfactor. In the above mentioned example, the 2-digit tariff line with a discrepancy of over USD50 million \nis caught by this threshold.  \n ", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   9 \nThreshold = (Average bilateral trade at the aggregate level) * (.01) * (0.10) \n \nAbsolute Difference = import-side data in digit \u03b1 \u2013 export-side data in digit \u03b1 \n \n \n3.2.   Methodology to Assess Direction Misclassifications \n \nThe  multiple  mirror  comparison  is  especially  helpful  in  examining  direction \nmisclassification committed by the customs office of one side. For example, if a test \ncountry\u2019s export data to Country A for Commodity X is much larger than its mirror, we \ncannot make a definitive argument on which side is inaccurate. However, when a test \ncountry\u2019s export data to Country A for Commodity X is much larger than its mirror, and at \nthe same time, a test country\u2019s export data to Country B for Commodity X is much \nsmaller than its mirror, there is a strong possibility that the test country erroneously \nrecorded its Commodity X exports to Country B (the actual destination) as exports to \nCountry A instead.  \n \nIn short, we first need to identify Country A and Country B, and then identify Commodity \nX.  Accordingly,  the  assessment  of  direction  misclassification  by  the  multiple  mirror \ntechnique involves two steps.  \n \nStep 1. Compare a test country's bilateral trade data with its major partners' bilateral \ntrade statistics at the aggregate level and identify a seeming set of false and actual \ndestination countries whose trade with the test country generates discrepancies in \nopposing directions (positive and negative discrepancies).  \n \nStep  2.  Compare  a  test  country\u2019s  bilateral  trade  with  a  possible  false-origin \ndestination  and  a  test  country\u2019s  bilateral  trade  with  a  possible  actual  origin  or \ndestination at the 2-digit commodity level and examine whether there are common \nasymmetric commodity groups with discrepancies in different directions.18 \n \n3.3.   Methodology to Assess Commodity Misclassifications \n \nThe multiple mirror comparison is also useful to examine commodity misclassification. If \na test country has a record of Commodity X export but not Commodity X\u2019 export to \nCountry A, while country A has a record of Commodity X\u2019 import but not Commodity X \nimport from the test country, it is difficult to conclude which customs office (the test \ncountry\u2019s or that of Country A) has committed commodity misclassification. However, if a \ntest country has a record of Commodity X export but not Commodity X\u2019 export to both \nCountry A and B, while both Country A and B have a record of Commodity X\u2019 import but \nnot  Commodity  X  import  from  the  test  country,  we  can  infer  that  commodity \nmisclassification is likely to be committed by the test country.  \n \n                                                 \n18  If a certain transit country has a negative discrepancy when compared with a test country while the \nsupposed actual destination has a positive discrepancy, it is inferred that the destination of goods are \nmisclassified. \n ", "10   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \nIn short, we should first identify Commodity X and X\u2019, then examine how trade partners \n(Country A and Country B) classify Commodity X or X\u2019. Accordingly, the assessment of \ncommodity misclassification by the multiple mirror technique involves two steps.  \n \nStep 1. Compare the discrepancy between a test country\u2019s exports or imports to or \nfrom the rest of the world and the rest of the world\u2019s imports or exports from or to a \ntest country at the commodity level. Then, identify asymmetric commodity groups \nand  find  a  set  of  similar  asymmetric  commodity  groups  with  discrepancies  in \nopposing directions (negative vs. positive).  \n \nStep 2. Examine if all major trade partners simultaneously classify the concerned \ntraded goods in a different manner than a test country. \n \n \n3.4.   Data Source \n \nThe study uses data from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database \n(UN Comtrade) because of the database\u2019s comprehensiveness. Trade value data in \nUnited States (US) dollars at the aggregate and 2-digit levels are used. Although it would \nbe ideal to use trade volume data, given that trade value is influenced by the CIF\u2013FOB \nfactor since exports are reported in FOB while imports are reported in CIF, trade value is \nthe only available data at the aggregate level. HS 2002-based figures are used for \n2000\u20132004 and 2008 because these were the only available data in the UN Comtrade \ndatabase.  \n \nAlthough all countries have export and import data to and from the rest of the world (total \nexports and imports), there is no readily available mirror data compiled by a single \nauthority. However, comparing one country\u2019s total exports and imports with its mirror is \nvery  helpful  in  understanding  the  overall  quality  of  that  country\u2019s  trade  statistics. \nTherefore, we use the aggregate import\u2013export data of all countries (other than the \nconcerned country) included in the UN Comtrade database to produce the mirror data \nfor the concerned country. \n \n \n4.   Examination of Cambodia\u2019s Export Statistics  \n \nThe quality of data on Cambodia\u2019s total exports to the world appears to be good. The \nimport\u2013export ratios for each year in 2000\u20132004 and 2008 range around 1.1 (Table 2). \nThis implies that the overall quality of Cambodia\u2019s export data is acceptable, while there \nmay be some problems at the disaggregated level.  \n \n4.1.

Despite the \nfact  that  the  overall  quality  of  Cambodia\u2019s  total  export  data  is  acceptable, \nmisclassifications seem to be prevalent within individual commodity groups. Table 5 \npresents asymmetric commodity groups in Cambodia\u2019s exports to the world against the \nworld\u2019s imports from Cambodia. There are several commodity groups that continuously \nappear as asymmetric (see commodities underlined in Table 5).  \n \nAt a glance, we cannot confirm any improvement in commodity misclassifications in \nrecent years. The number of asymmetric commodity groups has not changed much. \nWhile there were 29 asymmetric commodity groups in 2000 (16 \u201cno data on one side\u201d \ngroups  and  13  \u201clarge  discrepancy\u201d  groups),  there  were  30  asymmetric  commodity \ngroups in 2008 (12 \u201cno data on one side\u201d groups and 18 \u201clarge discrepancy\u201d groups). \n \nOn wood-related items, Cambodia\u2019s exports to the rest of the world were consistently \nsmaller than the rest of the world\u2019s imports from Cambodia in terms of HS 44 (wood and \narticles of wood, wood charcoal). On the other hand, in terms of HS 94 (furniture, \nlighting, signs, prefabricated buildings), Cambodia\u2019s exports to the rest of the world were \nconsistently  larger  than  the  rest  of  the  world\u2019s  imports  from  Cambodia.  Given  the \nsimilarity  between  the  two  groups,  it  can  be  inferred  that  Cambodia  may  have \nmisclassified exports in HS 44 as exports in HS 94.

Examination of Cambodia\u2019s Import Statistics  \n \nAs far as Cambodia\u2019s total imports from the world are concerned, the data quality \nappears to be poor. The import\u2013export ratios fell significantly below 1.1 in 2000\u20132004 \nand 2008 (Table 6). There should be concern over the quality of Cambodia\u2019s import \ndata, especially since import data are used for purposes of tariff revenue collection, \ntaxes,  trade  agreements,  and  other  regulatory  controls.  Thus,  the  data  should  be \naccurate and reliable. Moreover, there is a clear declining trend in the import\u2013export \nratios. This implies that over time either the difference between Cambodia\u2019s imports and \nits partners\u2019 exports expanded or the mismatch in the data worsened. From the trade \nand domestic policy perspective, this sketch of data quality calls for improvements in \ndata reporting. A smaller import value compared with a partner\u2019s export value implies \nthat some imports were inaccurately recorded due to, for example, issues of corruption. \n \n5.1.   Possible Direction Misclassifications among Cambodia\u2019s Imports \n \nCambodia\u2019s imports from major trade partners at the aggregate level. Cambodia\u2019s \nmajor  import  partners  in  2008  were  examined  to  investigate  possible  direction \nmisclassification. The import\u2013export ratios of Cambodia\u2019s import from each partner were \nlower than 1.1 for all of its trade partners with the exception of the US, which confirms \nthe finding at the aggregate level that Cambodia\u2019s import data quality is a cause of \nconcern (Table 7). \n \n ", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   17 \nTable 6: Cambodia\u2019s Total Imports ($ million) \n \nCambodia\u2019s  Rest of the World's  Discrepancy Import\u2013Export \n  Imports  Exports  (A-B)  Ratio \nA  B  (A/B) \n2000  1,439  1,795  \u2013356  0.80 \n2001  1,507  1,895  \u2013388  0.80 \n2002  1,667  2,139  \u2013471  0.78 \n2003  1,775  2,471  \u2013696  0.72 \n2004  2,063  2,991  \u2013928  0.69 \n2008  4,417  6,742  \u20132,325  0.66 \n \nSource: UN Comtrade database.   \n \n \nTable 7: Cambodia\u2019s Imports from Major Trade Partners, 2008 ($ million)  \n \n  Cambodia's  Trade Partners'  Average  Discrepancy  Import\u2013\nImports  Exports  Data  (A-B)  Export Ratio \nA  B  (A+B)/2  (A/B) \nThailand  697  2014  1,355  \u20131317  0.35 \nPRC  933  1096  1,014  \u2013162  0.85 \nViet Nam  472  1532  1,002  \u20131060  0.31 \nHong Kong, China  588  609  599  \u201320  0.97 \nRep. of Korea  229  294  412  \u201365  0.78 \nUS  220  154  262  \u201366  1.43 \nMalaysia  122  165  187  \u201343  0.74 \nSingapore  304  520  183  \u2013217  0.58 \nIndonesia  96  174  149  \u201378  0.55 \nJapan  114  184  61  \u201370  0.62 \nIndia  89  54  48  \u201349  0.09 \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \nSource: UN Comtrade database. \n \n \nThe lowest import\u2013export ratios occur with Thailand and Viet Nam. Given that these \ncountries both share a land border with Cambodia, it is probable that the discrepancies \nwere caused not by transit trade but by other reasons such as informal trade. For \nexample, if Cambodian custom officials erroneously recorded goods from a third country \nas goods from a neighboring transit country, then the import\u2013export ratio with such a \ntransiting country would become much higher than 1.1.   \n ", "18   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \nOn the other hand, the US has import\u2013export ratios with Cambodia that are greater than \n1.1, which means that Cambodia\u2019s imports from the US were significantly larger than US \nexports to Cambodia. Quite possibly, a third country\u2019s exports to Cambodia via the US \nwere recorded as imports from the US by Cambodian customs, resulting in a large \ndiscrepancy  in  the  import\u2013export  ratio.  However,  in  reality,  there  is  no  reasonable \nscenario under which an origin country at a distance from Cambodia greater than that of \nthe US would use US ports for transit purposes. Rather, this high ratio may be due to \ninaccuracies in the US data. Cambodia\u2019s imports from the US did pass through a transit \nport  and  the  US  recorded  the  goods  as  exports  to  the  transit  port  rather  than  to \nCambodia, resulting in Cambodia\u2019s imports from the US being larger than US exports to \nCambodia. In addition, US exporters may have some incentive to misreport that goods \nwere not exported to Cambodia.  \n \nBecause the import\u2013export ratio of Cambodia\u2019s total imports was very low in 2008 \n(0.66), we can say that the import\u2013export ratios of almost all its trade partners have a \ndownward bias. If we examine this downward bias, we can see that the ratios of two \ntransit economies, namely, Hong Kong, China and the Republic of Korea, are relatively \nlarge. Given the geographical location of the Republic of Korea and the fact that Japan, \nwhich has a small import\u2013export ratio even after taking into account the downward bias, \nwe can infer that Cambodia\u2019s imports from Japan were in part misclassified as imports \nfrom the Republic of Korea.    \n \nCambodia\u2019s imports from Japan and the Republic of Korea (Japan\u2013Republic of \nKorea\u2013Cambodia route) at the 2-digit commodity level. This section analyzes the \nJapan\u2013Republic of Korea\u2013Cambodia trade route, since the Republic of Korea seems to \nbe a transit country for some of Cambodia\u2019s imports from Japan. Table 8 summarizes \nthe asymmetric commodity groups between Cambodia and the Republic of Korea and \nJapan. While Cambodian data show that in 2000\u20132004 and 2008 there were imports \nfrom the Republic of Korea in HS 04, 10, 15, 18, 23, 40, 43, 55, 57, 66, 67, 76, 83, 89, \n90, and 97, the Korean data for the same years show that there were no exports to \nCambodia in HS 04, 10, 15, 18, 23, 43, 57, 66, 67, and 97, and only a small amount of \nexports  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  in  HS  40,  55,  and  89.  Theoretically  speaking, \nhowever, it is still difficult to conclude which side (Cambodia or the Republic of Korea) \ncommitted commodity misclassification if we only conduct a bilateral mirror comparison. \n \nHowever, if we compare the mirror analysis between Cambodia and the Republic of \nKorea with the mirror analysis between Cambodia and Japan, more plausible inferences \non the direction misclassification can be made. In Table 8, we observe that there are \nseveral commodity groups wherein Cambodia\u2019s imports from the Republic of Korea \nappear significantly larger than the Republic of Korea\u2019s exports to Cambodia. At the \nsame time, Cambodia\u2019s imports of the same commodity groups from Japan appear \nsignificantly smaller than Japan\u2019s exports to Cambodia (see commodities underlined in \nTable 8). This implies that these commodity groups may have been misclassified by \nCambodia as imports from the Republic of Korea rather than imports from Japan.  \n \nIn 2008, most commodities that Cambodia\u2019s data showed as imported from the Republic \nof Korea in large quantities and the Republic of Korea\u2019s data showed either no or few \nsuch commodities being exported to Cambodia were the same commodities for which \n ", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   19 \nCambodia  recorded  either  no  or  few  imports  from  Japan  while  the  Japanese  data \nshowed  large  quantities  of  such  exports  to  Cambodia.  More  specifically,  while  the \nCambodian data show that there were no or few imports in HS 15, 40, 55, and 89 from \nJapan,  the  Japanese  data  showed  that  there  were  larger  quantities  of  these \ncommodities exported to Cambodia. Accordingly, it is reasonable to infer that Cambodia \nerroneously recorded imports in HS 15, 40, 55, and 89 from Japan as imports from the \nRepublic  of  Korea,  rather  than  assuming  that  Japan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea \nsimultaneously committed misclassification.   \n \n \nTable 8: Japan\u2013Republic of Korea\u2013Cambodia Trade Route, 2000\u20132004 and \n2008  \n \n    2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2008 \nAsymmetric  No Data on One  16, 20,  25, 27,  04, 07,  11, 13,  09, 10,  04, 10, \ngroups in  Side Cambodia\u2019s  21, 25,  28, 35,  09, 11,  21, 25,  11,12,  15, 18, \nCambodia\u2019s  imports from the  27, 35,  57, 67,  12, 20,  42, 44,  21, 31,  23, 43, \nimports  Republic of Korea  45, 57,  68, 69,  21, 25,  45, 67,  43, 57,  57, 66, \nfrom the  not reported by the  70, 71,  74, 88,  27, 35,  68, 69,  69, 78,  67, 97 \nRepublic of  Republic of Korea  74, 99  99  36, 42,  99  81, 99 \nKorea  as exports to  57, 64, \n  Cambodia  66, 69, \n  82, 86, \n  97, 99 \n \nPositive  42, 55,   55, 56  55, 96  55, 56  55  40, 55, \nDiscrepancy  76, 83, \nCambodia\u2019s  89, 90 \nimports from the \nRepublic of Korea \nare greater than \nthe Republic of \nKorea\u2019s exports to \nCambodia \nAsymmetric  No Data on One  52, 59,  06, 74      31  15, 22, \ngroups in  Side Japan\u2019s  67  26, 78 \nCambodia\u2019s  exports to \nimports  Cambodia not \nfrom Japan  reported by \nCambodia as \nimports from Japan \nNegative  10, 16,  52, 89,  16, 30,  30, 38,  29, 54,  29, 40, \nDiscrepancy  69, 70,  95, 99  52, 54,  52, 54,  59, 89,  54, 55, \nCambodia\u2019s  82, 89,  59, 89,  56, 59,  95, 99  84, 89, \nimports from  95, 99  99  76, 82,  95, 96, \nJapan are less  89, 99  99 \nthan Japan\u2019s \nexports to \nCambodia \n \nSource: UN Comtrade database. \n ", "20   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \nTable 9: Republic of Korea\u2013Japan\u2013Cambodia Trade Route,  \n2000\u20132004 and 2008   \n \n    2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2008 \nAsymmetric  No Data on One  03, 05,  10, 12,  07, 12,  04, 05,  03, 04,  04, 08, \ngroups in  Side  07, 08,  21, 24,  15, 19,  07, 09,  09, 11,  10, 17, \nCambodia\u2019s  Cambodia\u2019s  09, 11,  28, 33,  20, 21,  10, 14,  12, 16,  19, 21, \nimports  imports from  12, 17,  42, 45,  22, 24,  19, 20,  19, 20,  24, 31, \nfrom Japan  Japan not reported  19, 20,  61, 62,  25, 26,  21, 22,  21, 22,  33, 57, \nby Japan as  24, 36,  65, 66,  28, 31,  24, 31,  24, 25,  61, 64, \nexports to  41, 42,  79, 80,  45, 46,  33, 37,  27, 28,  66, 97 \nCambodia  61, 71,  86, 92,  48, 58,  42, 46,  37, 42, \n74, 80,  97  62, 65,  57, 58,  46, 57, \n81, 86,  66, 67,  61, 65,  58, 65, \n91, 92  68, 71,  66, 67,  66, 67, \n76, 86,  70, 74,  75, 86 \n88, 91,  80, 81, \n92  86, 91, \n97 \nPositive  37, 39,  37, 38,  49, 60,  39, 41,  10, 55,  56 \nDiscrepancy  48, 49,  70, 82,  72, 87,  44, 49,  87,  96 \nCambodia\u2019s  90, 94  87, 90  90    55, 90 \nimports from Japan \nare greater than \nJapan\u2019s exports to \nCambodia \n \nAsymmetric  No Data on One  24, 51,  24, 71,  17, 51,  50, 51,  35, 50,  47, 53, \ngroups in  Side   89  53, 93  53, 89,  89  51, 71,  75, 80 \nCambodia\u2019s  Republic of  91, 92  74, 75, \nimports  Korea\u2019s exports to  89, 92 \nfrom the  Cambodia not \nRepublic of  reported by \nKorea  Cambodia as \nimports from the \nRepublic of Korea \nNegative  33, 41,  17, 33,  41, 52,  33, 39,  24, 33,  19, 22, \nDiscrepancy   52, 54,  48, 52,  54, 58,  41, 52,  39, 41,  24, 27, \nCambodia\u2019s  58, 59,  54, 58,  59, 60,  54, 58,  52, 54,  29, 33, \nimports from the  60, 62,  59, 60,  62, 65,  59, 60,  49, 58,  35, 41, \nRepublic of Korea  64, 65,  62, 65,  72, 85,  65, 70,  62, 65,  44, 52, \nare less than the  73, 91  70, 85,  90  90, 91,   70, 72,  56, 58, \nRepublic of  89, 91  84, 85,  60, 61, \nKorea\u2019s exports to  90  62, 64, \nCambodia   94 \n \nSource: UN Comtrade database.   \n \n \nCambodia\u2019s imports from the Republic of Korea and Japan (Republic of Korea\u2013\nJapan\u2013Cambodia route) at the 2-digit commodity level.

As shown in Table 9, there are a large number of commodity groups \nin  which  Cambodia\u2019s  imports  from  Japan  appear  larger  than  Japan\u2019s  exports  to \nCambodia. At the same time, Cambodia\u2019s imports from the Republic of Korea of the \nsame  commodity  groups  appear  smaller  than  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  exports  to \nCambodia (see commodities underlined). \n \nIn 2008, most commodities in which Cambodia had a relatively large amount of imports \nfrom Japan, while Japanese statistics showed no such exports to Cambodia, were the \nsame commodities for which Cambodia recorded no imports from the Republic of Korea \nwhile the Republic of Korea did record such exports to Cambodia.

There  are  several \ncommodity groups that continuously appear as asymmetric (see commodities underlined \nin Table 10). \n \nAt a glance, it appears that the discrepancy at the 2-digit level deteriorated and the \nnumber  of  asymmetric  commodity  groups  increased  during  the  years  under  review \n(2000\u20132004 and 2008). While there were 28 asymmetric commodity groups in 2000 (3 \n\u201cno  data  on  one  side\u201d  groups  and  25  \u201clarge  discrepancy\u201d  groups),  there  were  30 \nasymmetric commodity groups in 2008 (zero \u201cno data on one side\u201d groups and 30 \u201clarge \ndiscrepancy\u201d groups). Over time, there has been a declining number of matches in terms \nof  the  classification  of  goods.  In  other  words,  Cambodia  has  continued  to  classify \nexports under codes that are different than the codes its trade partners use to classify \nsuch goods. \n \n \n \n ", "22   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \nTable 10: Asymmetric Commodity Groups in Cambodia's Trade with the  \nRest of the World, 2000\u20132004 and 2008 \n \n    2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2008 \nAsymmetric  No Data on One  81    45  45, 81  47, 53   \ngroups  Side Cambodia\u2019s \nwhere  imports from the \nCambodia\u2019s  rest of the world \nimport data  not reported by \nappear  the rest of the \ngreater than  world as exports \nthe rest of  to Cambodia \nthe world\u2019s \nexport data  Positive  41, 49, 55,  55, 62  55, 62   55, 62  28, 55,  28, 49, \nDiscrepancy  62, 71  59, 62  55, 59 \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports from the \nrest of the world \nare larger than \nthe rest of the \nworld\u2019s exports to \nCambodia \nAsymmetric  No Data on One  26, 75  26, 53  51  26, 47, 75     \ngroups  Side Rest of the \nwhere  world\u2019s exports to \nCambodia\u2019s  Cambodia not \nimport data  reported by \nappear less  Cambodia as \nthan the rest  imports from the \nof the  rest of the world \nworld\u2019s \nexport data  Negative  03, 04, 15,  03, 04,  03, 04,  03, 04, 07,  04, 08,  01, 03, \nDiscrepancy  19, 20, 21,  19, 20,  08, 12,  08, 17, 19,  16, 17,  04, 08, \nCambodia\u2019s  22, 27, 32,  21, 22,  16, 19,  20, 21, 22,  19, 20,  15, 16, \nimports from the  33, 34, 37,  32, 33,  20, 21,  31, 32, 33,  21, 22,  17, 19, \nrest of the world  51, 52, 53,  37, 51,  22, 31,  34, 37, 38,  31, 32,  20, 21, \nare smaller than  59, 61, 91,  52, 54,  32, 33,  39, 51, 52,  33, 37,  22, 27, \nthe rest of the  95, 99  61, 68,  34, 37,  59, 61, 64,  38, 39,  29, 31, \nworld\u2019s exports to  99  49, 52,  72, 73, 82,  40, 51,  32, 33, \nCambodia  54, 59,  88, 89, 95,  52, 54,  34, 39, \n61, 64,  99  56, 61,  40, 52, \n68, 71,  64, 68,  53, 54, \n72, 89,  69, 70,  56, 61, \n99  72, 73,  72, 73, \n85, 89,  82, 83, \n95, 99  95, 99 \n \nSource: UN Comtrade database. \n \n \nOther  categories  in  which  Cambodia\u2019s  imports  from  the  rest  of  the  world  were \nconsistently smaller than the world\u2019s exports to Cambodia are HS 4 (dairy products, \neggs, honey, edible animal products), commodity groups relating to food such as HS 19 \n ", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   23 \n(cereal, flour, starch, milk preparations and products), HS 20 (vegetables, fruits, nuts, \nfood preparations), HS 21 (miscellaneous edible preparations), and HS 22 (beverages, \nspirits, vinegar); and commodity groups relating to chemicals  such as HS 32 (tanning, \ndyeing extracts, tannins, derived pigments), HS 33 (essential oils, perfumes, cosmetics, \ntoiletries),  HS  34  (soaps,  lubricants,  waxes,  candles,  modeling  pastes),  HS  37 \n(photographic or cinematographic goods) and HS 95 (toys, games, sports requisites). \n \nCambodia\u2019s imports by major commodity group at the bilateral level. The analysis \nabove, however, does not unambiguously indicate that the commodity misclassifications \nwere indeed committed by Cambodian customs officials. If we look at various bilateral \nmirror  analyses,  we  can  have  a  better  idea  of  which  party  committed  commodity \nmisclassification. As we have already stated, HS 51, 52, and 59 are the commodity \ngroups in which Cambodia had no or few imports from the rest of the world in 2000\u2013\n2004 and 2008, while there were large amounts of exports to Cambodia from the rest of \nthe world in these years. Meanwhile, the lower halves of Tables 8 and 9 display the \ncommodity groups in which the Cambodian data show there are no or few imports from \nJapan and the Republic of Korea, while the Japanese and Korean data show a high \nvolume  of  exports  to  Cambodia  (see  commodities  in  shadow  in  Tables  8  and  9). \nInterestingly, both the Japanese and Korean data suggest that they exported a large \namount  of  items  under  HS  52  and  59.  Accordingly,  it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that \nCambodia\u2019s commodity classification was inaccurate, with Cambodia\u2019s garment-related \nimports being incorrectly recorded as HS 55 and 62 instead of HS 51, 52, and 59, rather \nthan considering that Japan and the Republic of Korea simultaneously committed the \nsame commodity misclassification. \n \n \n6.   Conclusion \n \nThis  study  questioned  the  accuracy  of  trade  statistics  and  whether  the  observed \ndiscrepancies stem from two types of misclassification: commodity misclassification and \ndirection  misclassification.  It  examined  the  magnitude  of  the  two  misclassification \nproblems  in  the  trade  data  by  using  the  mirror  statistics.  The  fundamental \nmethodological problem common in the existing literature on mirror analysis is that we \ncannot conclude which customs office, whether the exporting or the importing side, is the \nsource  of  a  discrepancy,  particularly  since  the  analysis  is  limited  to  a  bilateral \ncomparison of trade partner statistics. In order to overcome this, we need to compare \nthe results of a bilateral mirror comparison with another bilateral mirror comparison\u2019s \nresults.  By  using  a  multiple  mirror  technique  to  compare  discrepancies,  this  paper \ncarefully examined which (i) products were misclassified under similar (but ultimately \ndifferent) products, and (ii) goods to or from a country were misclassified as goods to or \nfrom another country.  \n \nWhile the discrepancies among Cambodia\u2019s export data against the sum of all of its \ntrade  partners\u2019  import  data  are  small  at  the  total  level,  there  are  serious \nmisclassifications with regard to both direction and commodity type at the disaggregated \nlevel. While Cambodian statistics show that there were large amounts of exports to Hong \nKong, China in several commodities in 2000\u20132004 and 2008, the statistics from Hong \nKong, China indicate no such imports. Interestingly, while Cambodia\u2019s data do not show \n ", "24   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \nthat there were exports of those same commodities to the US, Japan, and the PRC, \nthose countries\u2019 statistics indicate that there were imports of those commodities from \nCambodia. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that there has been direction misclassification \nin  Cambodia\u2019s  export  data.  Cambodia\u2019s  export  data  also  has  commodity \nmisclassifications. While the Cambodian statistics say that there were HS 94 exports \n(furniture,  lighting,  signs,  prefabricated  buildings)  but  no  HS  44  exports  (wood  and \narticles of wood, wood charcoal) exports in 2000\u20132004 and 2008, all of its major training \npartners\u2019 statistics indicate HS 44 imports from Cambodia but no HS 94 imports.  \n \nThe overall quality of Cambodia\u2019s import data is much worse than its export data. The \ntotal of Cambodia\u2019s imports was only about half the sum of its trade partners\u2019 exports to \nCambodia in 2000\u20132004 and 2008, even when considering the CIF\u2013FOB difference. \nThus, in addition to misclassifications, there are other factors that contribute to the \ndeterioration of the quality of import statistics such as smuggling. It is reasonable to \nconsider that the quality of import data is worse than export data because the former is \ndirectly  related  to  tariff  revenue.  It  is  probable  that  the  magnitude  of  direction \nmisclassification is considerable. In the case of trade from the Republic of Korea and \nJapan, goods coming from Japan were often classified as imports from the Republic of \nKorea and vice versa. (The trade statistics of Japan and the Republic of Korea are \nconsistent with each other). Thus, there is substantial direction misclassification, which is \nnot reflected at the aggregate level. Commodity misclassification problems are also \npresent in Cambodia\u2019s import data. A number of Cambodia\u2019s trade partners\u2019 statistics \nindicate that there were exports to Cambodia in HS 51 (wool, animal hair, horsehair yarn \nand fabric thereof), 52 (cotton), and 59 (impregnated, coated, or laminated textile fabric), \nrather than in HS 55 (manmade staple fibers) or 62 (articles of apparel, accessories, not \nknit or crochet), while the Cambodian data shows the latter is the case.       \n \nFinally, improving the quality of trade statistics has practical importance for all countries, \nespecially LDCs such as Cambodia. One potential way to improve data collection and \ncompilation  is  by  engaging  in  technical  assistance  from  international  organizations \nspecializing in customs administration, such as the World Customs Organization (WCO), \nfor  the  recording  of  goods  using  the  HS  classification  system.  Cambodia  can  also \nconsider  the  quality  dimensions  set  out  in  the  IMF\u2019s  Data  Quality  Assessment \nFramework,  which  identifies  quality-related  features  of  the  governance  of  statistical \nsystems,  processes,  and  products.  The  quality  dimensions  include  assurance  of \nintegrity,  methodological  soundness,  accuracy  and  reliability,  serviceability,  and \naccessibility (IMF 2003).19 International institutions specializing in economic monitoring \nsuch  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations (ASEAN) can also assist in the development of data reporting systems. \n \n                                                 \n19  While Cambodia is not a member, the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice \nadopted by the Statistical Programme Committee of the European Council in 2005 are also useful in \nimproving the quality of statistics. The Code is a set of guidelines that Cambodia can use to improve the \nquality of its trade statistics. The principles include professional independence, mandate for data \ncollection,  adequacy  of  resources,  quality  commitment,  statistical  confidentiality,  impartiality  and \nobjectivity,  sound  methodology,  appropriate  statistical  procedures,  non-excessive  burden  on \nrespondents,  cost  effectiveness,  relevance,  accuracy  and  reliability,  timeliness  and  punctuality, \ncoherence and comparability, and accessibility and clarity (European Statistics Code of Practice 2005). \n ", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   25 \nReferences \n \nEuropean  Statistics  Code  of  Practice.  2005.
