The  paper  identifies  inaccuracies  in  trade \nstatistics  caused  by  two  types  of  misclassifications:  commodity  misclassification  and \ndirection misclassification. We will thoroughly examine products that are misclassified as \ndifferent (but similar) products as well as goods to or from a particular country that are \nmisclassified as goods to or from another country. A single bilateral mirror comparison, \nwhich  is  common  in  the  existing  literature,  does  not  tell  us  much  about  the  manner  in \nwhich  misclassifications  are  committed.  Even  if  we  observe  a  large  discrepancy  in \ncertain traded commodities between two sides, we cannot immediately conclude which \nside has generated the inaccurate statistic. In order to overcome this problem, the paper \nwill  use  the  multiple  mirror  comparison  technique.  By  comparing  the  results  of  various \nbilateral  mirror  analyses  of  trade  statistics,  we  can  identify  which  direction  and \ncommodity misclassifications have been committed by Cambodia. \n \n \nKeywords:  quality  of  trade  statistics;  misclassification;  smuggling;  multiple  mirror \ntechnique; c.i.f./f.o.b. ratio \n \nJEL Classification: F13, C46\n\n \n\n \n\n\f\fUtilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   1 \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \n \nIdeally, statistics on the goods traded between two countries should be captured by each \nside\u2019s  respective  customs  office.  Country  A\u2019s  recorded  exports  to  Country  B  should  be \nidentical to Country B\u2019s recorded imports from Country A (mirror statistics). While there \nmay  be  some  discrepancies  caused  by  errors  and  statistical  methodology  differences \nbetween the two authorities, we should expect that the two sides of the mirror statistics \nare more or less similar.  \n \nHowever, in reality the two sides of the mirror statistics are often very different; at best, \nlike  a  reflection  on  the  surface  of  a  puddle.  This  is  especially  true  for  trade  statistics \ncompiled by developing countries. Various factors cause discrepancies in both the value \nand quantity of trade recorded. The first possibility is that the customs offices of the two \nsides  record  the  same  quantity  but  at  different  values.  In  this  case,  the  difference  is \nlimited  to  price.  The  second  possibility  is  that  the  two  customs  offices  record  different \nquantities as well. Differences in quantity can be caused by transshipment. There is also \nthe  possibility  of  customs  offices  committing  human  errors  leading  to  misclassification, \nas well as the effects of smuggling by traders.    \n \nThe general view on the accuracy of data collected by customs offices is that import data \nare  more  reliable  than  export  data  because  governments  are  more  serious  about \nrecording  imported  goods  for  purposes  of  tariff  revenue  collection,  taxes,  and  other \nregulatory controls. This could also be the case with regard to direction classification as \ncustoms officers carefully examine the origin of imports because the relevant amount of \ntariffs  they  need  to  collect  is  determined  based  on  the  good\u2019s  origin,  while  they  are \ngenerally  less  interested  in  the  recipient  country  of  exported  goods.  At  the  same  time, \nhowever, traders may have an incentive to under-report the value of imported goods to \navoid paying tariffs.1  \n \nThis  paper  assesses  the  quality  of  Cambodian  trade  statistics  by  utilizing  the  mirror \ntechnique  and  studies  the  magnitude  of  the  misclassification  problem.2  It  focuses \nspecifically on the inaccuracy of trade statistics caused by two types of misclassification: \ncommodity misclassification and direction misclassification. We will thoroughly examine \nproducts that are misclassified as different (but similar) products and products to or from \na  particular  country  that  are  misclassified  as  products  to  or  from  another  country.  In \ndoing so, we will move beyond a simple comparison between import and export data at \nthe aggregated or disaggregated level in existing research.  \n \nThe  structure  of  the  paper  is  as  follows.  The  next  section  reviews  existing  empirical \nstudies  on  sources  of  discrepancy  between  mirror  data,  as  well  as  literature  on  the \ncomparison of mirror statistics. Bearing in mind the methodological weakness of existing \nstudies,  the  third  section  explains  the  methodology  used  in  this  paper,  \u201cmultiple  mirror \ntechnique,\u201d which is suitable to assess the quality of trade statistics. The fourth and fifth \nsections  analyze  the  quality  of  export  and  import  statistics  of  Cambodia,  respectively. \n\n                                                 \n1 \n\nThe value of exports can also be manipulated (in this case through over-invoicing) as a way to misuse \nduty drawbacks. \nFor the quality assessment of trade statistics of Lao PDR, see Hamanaka (2011).  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f2   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\nThe  final  section  summarizes  the  empirical  findings  of  this  paper  and  considers  the \nimplications for other transitional economies.  \n \n \n2.   Literature on Discrepancies in Mirror Data and the \n\nAccuracy of Trade Data \n\n \n2.1.   Source of Discrepancies in Mirror Data  \n \nVarious factors can lead to discrepancies in mirror statistics (Yeats 1995, Makhoul and \nOtterstorm  1998,  Ferrantino  and  Wang  2008,  Eurostat  2009).  While  the  focus  of  this \npaper  is  on  misclassifications  associated  with  commodities  and  the  direction  of  trade, \nwhich  are  mainly  incurred  by  customs  offices  (of  either  the  exporting  or  importing \ncountry),3  it  is  important  to  understand  factors  aside  from  misclassifications  that  cause \ndiscrepancies among mirror statistics (Table 1).  \n \nFirst,  differences  in  reporting  costs  cause  discrepancies  because  exports  are  mostly \nreported  on  a  free  on  board  (FOB)  basis,4  while  imports  are  reported  on  a  costs, \ninsurance,  and  freight  (CIF)  basis.  The  CIF\u2013FOB  differences  may  result  in  a  higher \nimport value than export value. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that on \naverage,  the  CIF  price  is  larger  than  the  FOB  price  by  10%.5  However,  the  CIF\u2013FOB \nratio becomes larger as the distance between trade partners increases and the weight of \nthe traded goods becomes heavier (Pomfret and Sourdin 2009).  \n \nSecond, the exchange rate is another contributing factor to differences in cost reporting, \nmaking  it  difficult  to  predict  which  side  of  the  mirror  data  will  have  a  higher  value.  The \ncustoms  office  may  set  its  own  exchange  rate  for  conversion  purposes,  such  as  the \nmonthly  average  rate,  which  may  not  necessarily  coincide  with  the  market  rate  at  the \ntime  the  goods  are  actually  traded.  Moreover,  the  exchange  rates  used  by  the  two \ncustoms offices may differ.  \n \nThird,  the  difference  in  timing  is  presumed  to  be  a  cause  of  discrepancy  in  some \ninstances  when  exports  leave  the  port  of  origin  during  the  last  month  of  the  year  and \narrive at the port of destination the next year. Although this factor is prominent when we \nanalyze  monthly  data,  it  becomes  marginal  when  we  use  annual  data.  If  trade  has  a \ngrowing trend and the time lag between export and import timing is significant, the export \nvalue will be larger than the import value for that period. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  While traders are considered the immediate party that commits errors (e.g., misreporting traded goods), \nwe regard this as a misclassification committed on the part of the customs office since it is responsible \nfor ensuring that data submitted by traders are accurate.   \nExports  are  sometimes  reported  on  a  free  alongside  ship  (FAS)  basis,  which  equals  FOB  minus  the \ncost of loading the ship. \nTo estimate a mirror export, the partner country's import value is divided by 1.1.

Even if neither party commits any \nerrors  in  recording  the  origin  or  destination  of  the  goods,  the  discrepancy  may  occur \nbecause  the  trade  partners\u2019  customs  offices  subscribe  to  different  rules  of  origin  since \nthere  is  no  universal  rule  on  specifying  the  origin  and  destination  of  goods.  The \ndetermination of the origin of re-exports6 or transshipped goods7 is particularly important \nin  this  regard.  In  addition,  trade  to  and  from  free  trade  zones  is  another  issue  that \nproduces  differences  in  coverage.  Countries  with  different  trading  systems,  whether \ngeneral  or  special,  will  have  different  coverage  of  recorded  transactions  because  the \nformer  includes  all  transactions in  the  free  trade  zone  while  the  latter  does  not  include \nsuch transactions.8 Finally, goods that are already recorded as imports but are returned \nto  the  exporting  country  for  any  reason  will  not  be  recorded  by  the  intended  importing \ncountry but will continue to be in the record of the exporting country.  \n \nFifth, traders sometimes deliberately make false declarations of the value of the goods \nor the origin and/or destination of goods in order to take advantage of duty reductions or \nthe  duty  drawback  scheme.  For  example,  traders  might  declare  an  inflated  value  for \nexports  (over-invoicing)  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  the  duty  drawback  program.9 \nWhen this happens, the value of the export side of the reporting country becomes larger \nthan  that  of  the  import  side  of  the  partner  country.  10  Another  common  practice  is  tariff \nevasion by under-reporting the import value. Transfer pricing is also a common practice \nto  avoid  various  tariffs  and  duties  (e.g.,  domestic  taxes)  that  is  engaged  in  by  related \nparties  in  different  countries,  such  as  different  branches  of  a  multinational  corporation. \nThis  practice  shifts  profits  from  high-tax  countries  to  low-tax  countries  (Ferrantino  and \nWang 2008).  \n \nFinally,  misclassification  by  customs  offices,  which  is  the  focus  of  this  paper,  is  also  a \ncritical  factor  in  determining  discrepancies  observed  among  mirror  data.  There  are  two \nkinds of trade misclassification. Commodity misclassification is the faulty recording of the \nsame  good  under  different  commodity  codes  by  either  the  exporting  or  importing \ncountry's  customs  office.  The  presumption  is  that  misclassification  may  occur  among \n\n                                                 \n6  Re-export  takes  place  when  goods  enter  a  customs  territory  from  one  country  and  are  shipped  to \n\nanother country without being modified. \nTransshipment,  or  \"goods  in  transit,\"  includes  merchandise  that  passes  through  ports  but  is  not \nunloaded from the ship or aircraft. \nThe general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its economic \nterritory. The special trade system (strict definition) is in use when the statistical territory comprises only \nthe  free  circulation  area,  that  is,  the  area  within  which  goods  \"may  be  disposed  of  without  customs \nrestriction.\" The special trade system (relaxed definition) is in use when (i) goods that enter a country for \nor  leave  it  after  inward  processing  and  (ii)  goods  that  enter  or  leave  an  industrial  free  zone  are  also \nrecorded  and  included  in  international  merchandise  trade  statistics  based  on  the  International \nMerchandise Trade Statistics Concepts and Definitions. United Nations. Series M, No. 52, Revision 2. \nSee Eurostat (2009).  \n\n9  Using  mirror  trade  data,  Mahmood  and  Azhar  (2001)  hypothesized  the  presence  of  over-invoicing  of \nexports in Pakistan due to the duty drawback incentive scheme. The study found that there is a strong \npresence of over-invoicing across various trade partners and products.  \n\n10  Javorcik  and  Narciso  (2007)  found  that  the  discrepancy  between  the  value  of  exports  reported  by \nGermany and the value of imports reported by Germany\u2019s trade partners is positively related to the level \nof tariffs in 8 out of 10 countries surveyed. \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f4   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\ntraded  goods  whose  commodity  descriptions  or  names  are  somewhat  similar. \nOftentimes,  it  is  difficult  to  trace  which  side,  importer  or  exporter,  commits  the  error  in \nmisclassification, thereby making the discrepancies in trade statistics immeasurable and \nunpredictable. \n \nDirection misclassification is associated with attributing the origin of traded goods to the \nwrong  country.  This  problem  is  prominent  in  the  case  of  re-exports  or  transshipments. \nFor  example,  suppose  that  goods  originating  from  Country  A  pass  through  Country  B \nbefore  reaching  the  final  destination,  Country  C.  The  origin  country  (Country  A)  may \nrecord goods as exports to either Country B or C. Country C may record the goods as \nimports from either Country B or A. And the transit country (Country B) may record the \ngoods as imports from Country A and exports to Country C, re-exports to Country C, or \nperhaps  the  transit  country  does  not  record  anything  at  all.  Again,  even  if  there  is  a \ndiscrepancy, it is difficult to determine which country\u2019s customs office (A, B, or C) has the \ncorrect record. \n \n\nTable 1: Causes of Discrepancies between Mirror Data \n\nFactors \n\nCauses \n\nChange in Price \nand/or Quantity \n\nUnavoidable factors \n\nFOB\u2013CIF difference \n\nPrice \n\n \n\nfreight cost \ninsurance costs \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\ndifferences in rules of origin \n(especially in the cases of re-export) \nprocessing zone \nreturned goods \n\nTime lag \n\nExchange rate \n\nStructural differences between \ntwo customs offices \n\nCoverage \n\nDeliberate misreporting by \ntraders and errors committed by \ncustoms offices \n\nFalse declaration of value by traders\n\nQuantity and Price \n\nFalse declaration of origin by traders\n\nCommodity misclassification by customs \n\nDirection misclassification by customs \n\nSource: Author\u2019s compilation. \n \nFederico  and  Tena  (1991)  classified  these  factors  into  three  groups\u2014unavoidable \nfactors,  structural  differences,  and human  errors  and  deliberate  misreporting  (Table  1). \nThe CIF\u2013FOB difference is classified as an unavoidable factor because the inclusion of \nfreight  costs  in  the  import  price,  but  not  in  the  export  price,  is  a  factor  in  causing \ndiscrepancies.  Second,  structural  differences  include  differences  in  coverage  between \nthe  two  customs  offices,  a  time  lag  factor,  and  exchange  rate  fluctuations  since  these \nare  associated  with  differences  in  the  policy  decisions  of  each  customs  office.  Finally, \nhuman  factors  are  also  critical  determinants  of  the  discrepancy  in  mirror  statistics. \nDeliberate  misreporting  by  traders  includes  false  declaration  of  both  price  and  quantity \n\nQuantity \n\nQuantity \n\nPrice \n\nQuantity \n\nQuantity \n\nQuantity \n\n \n\n\fUtilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   5 \n\n(and thus value). Traders face the incentive to manipulate goods classification as well as \nclassification  of  origin  and  destination  in  order  to  avoid  duties.  Errors  committed  by \ncustoms offices are also critical and these fall under both direction misclassification and \ncommodity misclassification. \n \n2.2.   Literature on the Comparison of Mirrors  \n \nThe  existing  literature  on  the  comparison  of  mirror  statistics  can  be  classified  into  two \ngroups  based  on  the  type  of  data  used.  The  first  group  of  literature  directly  compares \nCounty X\u2019s CIF import from (FOB export to) Country Y against Country Y\u2019s FOB export \nto  (CIF import  from)  Country  X,  both  at  the  aggregate  and  bilateral  levels.  Using  pre-\nWorld War II data of the major trading countries, Federico and Tena (1991) find that the \ntotal  of  a  country\u2019s  exports  (imports)  basically  matches  the  total  of  its  trade  partners\u2019 \nimports from (exports to) that country.  \n \nHowever, the assessment of the total sum employed by Federico and Tena (1991) may \ndisguise various discrepancies at the disaggregated level in terms of both directions and \ncommodities  (over-estimation  and  under-estimation)  that  cancel  each  other  out  at  the \naggregate level. Thus, there is a possibility that the discrepancy at the total level would \nbe small even when there are large discrepancies observable at the disaggregated level. \nAccordingly,  Makhoul  and  Otterstorm  (1998)  calculated  the  discrepancies  of  an  over-\nestimation  group  and  that  of  an  under-estimation  group  separately,  and  checked  if  the \nsatisfactory  result  at  the  aggregated  level  is  due  to  canceling  out  effects.  Their \nconclusion  is  that  these  effects  are  large  and  the  discrepancy  between  mirrors  is \nsignificant at the disaggregated level.  \n \nMeanwhile,  Yeats  (1995)  compared  developing  countries\u2019  total  export\u2013import  values \nagainst the sum of the rest of the world\u2019s import\u2013export values through trade with them.  \nHe  finds  that  the  mirror  method  is  inadequate  in  estimating  the  missing  trade  data  of \ndeveloping  countries;  this  is  especially  true  at  the  disaggregated  level.  This  finding  is \nimportant  because  the  discrepancy  is  large  even  at  the  aggregate  level  (of  all  trade \npartners), where we can otherwise ignore direction factors, implying that a miscoding of \ndata is persistent.  \n \nThe weakness of the first group of literature is that it is difficult to separate discrepancies \ncaused  by  reasonable  factors  such  as  transport  costs  from  the  so-called  noise,  which \nincludes  discrepancies  associated  with  human  errors  such  as  misclassifications. \nAccordingly, this group of literature tends to focus on whether the discrepancy is large or \nsmall. It simply measures the size of discrepancies and then lists down possible factors \nto  explain  the  discrepancies  without  analyzing  the  impact  of  each  factor.  The  literature \nseldom discusses whether the discrepancy is caused by reasonable CIF\u2013FOB factors or \nother reasons, despite the fact that the discrepancy between the two sides of the mirror \ndata  stems  not  only  from  price  factors,  including  the  CIF\u2013FOB  difference,  but  also \nbecause  quantities  are  different.  So  long  as  we  compare  only  CIF  import  values  and \nFOB export values compiled by different customs offices, separating the two (CIF\u2013FOB \nfactor and other factors) will remain extremely difficult.   \n \n\n \n\n\f6   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\nimplies \n\nSeveral  customs  offices  collect,  compile,  and  release  import  data  on  a  FOB  basis  in \naddition to a CIF basis.11 The FOB import data is said to be a more accurate partner of \nCIF  import  data,  as  opposed  to  the  mirror  data,  because  they  originate  from  the  same \ncustoms office. Using FOB import data, we can conduct a better analysis on the quality \nof  a  trade  partner\u2019s  FOB  export  data.  The  fundamental  problem  of  the  first  group  of \nliterature  (reasonable  price  factor  versus  others)  can  thus  be  solved  to  a  degree \nbecause  the  difference  between  CIF  and  FOB  import  values  from  one  customs  office \napproximates transport costs.12   \n \nEmploying  matched  US  and  partner  country  trade  data,  Yeats  (1978)  attempted  to \nseparate  the  observed  variations  in  FOB  export\u2013CIF  import  statistics  into  freight  costs \nand discrepancies caused by other factors (residual) using FOB import data.13 He finds \nthat the residual becomes larger and the discrepancy of the mirror becomes significant \nwhen  we  use \nthat  commodity \nlower  digit  commodity-level  data.  This \nmisclassification is a serious problem in customs offices in developing countries.  \n   \nHummels  and  Lugovskyy  (2006)  compare  the  two  kinds  of  discrepancies:  (i)  the \ndiscrepancy between CIF-based bilateral imports and FOB-based bilateral imports, and \n(ii) the discrepancy between CIF-based bilateral imports collected by the import side and \nFOB-based bilateral exports collected by the exporting side. Their conclusion is that the \ndiscrepancy  between  matched  partner  trade  statistics  (a  certain  country\u2019s  CIF-based \nimports and its partner\u2019s FOB-based exports) is significant and includes not only trade or \ntransport  costs  but  also  various  noises  associated  with  structural  factors  as  well  as \nhuman factors.  \n \nThe  fundamental  methodological  problem  common  to  both  groups  of  literature  is  that \nbased on a single bilateral mirror comparison, we cannot conclude which customs office, \nwhether the exporting or the importing side, is the source of the discrepancy. Ultimately, \nit is difficult to assert which side of the statistics is inaccurate. Even if some studies were \nable  to  establish  that  a  discrepancy  that  is  not  caused  by  reasonable  factors,  such  as \ntransport  costs,  is  significant,  we  cannot  conclude  which  side  produced  such  a \ndiscrepancy.  This  is  because  the  existing  literature\u2019s  focus  is  limited  to  bilateral \ncomparisons. A method to overcome this problem will be explained in the next section. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11  These include the US, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and Chile.  \n12  Using FOB and CIF import data released by the same customs office, researchers can concentrate on \nthe FOB\u2013CIF difference and examine trade or transport costs, and ignore quantity discrepancies when \nusing data from one source only. However, this type of study may no longer be called mirror analysis \nbecause the trade data being used is compiled by only one customs office. It has been stated that the \nFOB\u2013CIF  difference  becomes  large  when  the  goods  being  traded  are  heavy  and  when  the  distance \nbetween  the  two  trade  partners  is  great.  Nevertheless,  a  large  portion  of  the  difference  still  remains \ninsufficiently explained (Pomfret and Sourdin 2009).   \n\n13  Freight  costs  can  be  calculated  as  the  difference  between  FOB-based  export  data  and  CIF-based \nimport  data  (both  data  are  collected  by  the  US).  The  difference  between  the  FOB  export\u2013CIF  import \nvariation and the calculated freight cost is the residual. \n\n \n\n\fUtilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   7 \n\n3.   Methodology of Multiple Mirror Comparison  \n \nThis  paper  assesses  the  quality  of  trade  statistics  by  comparing  a  test  country\u2019s  trade \ndata  against  its  trade  partners\u2019  data.  Countries  that  publish  FOB-based  import  data  do \nnot  necessarily  provide  us  with  an  ideal  benchmark  to  test  the  quality  of  Cambodian \ntrade  statistics  for  several  reasons.14  This  study  belongs  to  the  first  group  of  literature \nexplained  in  the  previous  section.  Accordingly,  it  has  an  inherent  methodological \nproblem. That is, the discrepancy between the mirrors also includes the variation caused \nby  reasonable  factors,  such  as  the  CIF\u2013FOB  gap.  In  order  to  avoid  this  problem,  the \nstudy  focuses  on  commodity  groups  that  have  significantly  large  discrepancies  that \ncannot be attributed solely to price factors.  \n \nAs we have seen, we cannot conclude which side\u2019s statistics (importer or exporter) are \ninaccurate, even if we are able to establish that the discrepancy is large, so long as the \nanalysis  is  limited  to  a  single  bilateral  mirror  comparison.  A  single  bilateral  mirror \ncomparison, which is common in the existing literature, does not tell us much about the \nmanner in which misclassifications are committed. In order to overcome this, we need to \ncompare  the  results  of  various  bilateral  mirror  analyses  of  trade  statistics  (multiple \nmirrors comparison).  \n \nThis  section  first  explains  the  definition  of  the  import\u2013export  ratio  and  two  concepts  of \nasymmetric commodity groups. It then discusses methodologies to assess direction and \ncommodity misclassifications through the multiple mirror technique. \n \n3.1.   Definition of Discrepancy and Asymmetric Commodity Groups \n \n\n3.1.1.   Measurement of Discrepancy: Import\u2013Export Ratio \n\n \nIn order to assess the size of the discrepancy between the two sides of the mirror, we \nwill use the import\u2013export ratio as defined below.  \n \n\nImport\u2013Export Ratio (aggregate level) = Aggregate import-side data/Aggregate \nexport- side data  \n \nImport\u2013Export Ratio of tariff line \u03b1 (2-digit) = Import-side data in digit \u03b1/Export-side \ndata in digit \u03b1 \n\n \nThe  term  \"positive  discrepancy\"  refers  to  the  case  where  the  import-side  data  is  larger \nthan the export-side data by more than 10%. \u201cNegative discrepancy\" refers to the case \nwhere the import-side data is smaller than export-side data, or the import-side exceeds \nthe export-side by less than 10%. In other words, positive (negative) discrepancy is used \nwhen the import\u2013export ratio is higher (lower) than 1.10, which represents the CIF\u2013FOB \ngap. \n \n \n                                                 \n14  One reason is that the accuracy of data on trade between Cambodia and its trade partners as reported \n\nin those partners\u2019 statistics is questionable due to geographic location.    \n\n \n\n\f8   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\n3.1.2.   Two Types of Asymmetric Commodity Groups \n\n \nThe analysis at the 2-digit level focuses on asymmetric commodity groups wherein the \nexport\u2013import  data  compiled  by  the  customs  office  of  one  side  is  significantly  different \nfrom the import\u2013export data compiled by the customs office of the other side. There are \ntwo  types  of  asymmetric  commodity  groups:  \u201cno  reported  data  on  one  side\u201d  and \n\u201cextremely large discrepancy,\u201d which can either be positive or negative.  \n \nNo reported data on one side of the mirror. We consider this an important indicator of \nmisclassification regardless of the size of the figure on the other side because \u201cno data\u201d \nimplies that the customs office either did not record the trade transaction or recorded the \ntransaction  but  under  a  different  commodity  classification  than  that  of  the  partner.  The \nlack  of  reported  export  (import)  on  only  one  side  of  the  mirror  reflects  possible \nmisclassification.  That  is,  the  goods  could  have  been  accounted  for  by  the  customs \noffice but were possibly classified under commodity codes different from the commodity \ncodes under which the partner recorded such goods.  \n\nExtremely large discrepancy. Tariff lines or commodities that satisfy the two conditions \ndetailed  below  are  regarded  as  asymmetric  tariff  lines  with  an  extremely  large \ndiscrepancy.  First,  the 2-digit  level discrepancy  ratio  (see  formula  above)  should  either \nbe  higher  than  2.0  or  lower  than  0.5.  Taking  into  account  the  acceptable  level  of \ndiscrepancy attributed to the CIF\u2013FOB factor discussed above (imports exceed exports \nby  10%  or  more),  a  ratio  of  more  than  2.0  and  less  than  0.5  can  be  considered \nsignificant.  Second,  we  introduce  the  concept  of  the  absolute  size  of  discrepancy  and \nregard  the  tariff  line  as  asymmetric  between  the  two  sides  of  the  mirror  when  the \ndiscrepancy is greater than a certain threshold, which changes depending on the size of \ntrade.  In  order  to  calculate  the  threshold  for  each  2-digit  commodity  code,  we  first \ncalculate  the  average  aggregate  bilateral  trade  value  using  both  sides  of  the  mirror \ndata.15  Based  on  this  averaged  aggregate  bilateral  trade  value,  we  compute  a \ntheoretically  reasonable  value  of  trade  at  each  2-digit  level,  which  is  1%  of  aggregate \nbilateral trade.16 The threshold employed is 10% of this theoretically reasonable amount \nof each 2-digit commodity.17 In short, when the import\u2013export ratio is higher than 2.0 or \nlower than 0.5, and the absolute difference is larger than the threshold mentioned above, \nwe regard that such a commodity group has an extremely large discrepancy.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAveraged bilateral trade at the aggregate level \n= A test country\u2019s aggregate trade with a partner + the partner\u2019s aggregate trade with \na test country / 2 \n \n\n                                                 \n15  For  example,  when  Country  A's  imports  from  Country  B  are  USD45  trillion  (Country  A\u2019s  data)  and \nCountry  B's  exports  to  Country  A  are  USD55  trillion  (Country  B  data),  the  average  value  of  the \naggregate bilateral trade becomes USD50 trillion.  \n\n16  1% is used because there are roughly 100 2-digit commodity groups. While there are actually 97 groups \nand 1 group that includes goods not classified elsewhere (No. 99), 1% is used for ease of calculation. In \nthe above example, the theoretically reasonable amount of each 2-digit trade volume is USD500 million. \n17  10%  is  used  because  the  discrepancy  within  10%  should  be  considered  normal  given  the  CIF\u2013FOB \nfactor. In the above mentioned example, the 2-digit tariff line with a discrepancy of over USD50 million \nis caught by this threshold.  \n\n \n\n\fUtilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   9 \n\nThreshold = (Average bilateral trade at the aggregate level) * (.01) * (0.10) \n \nAbsolute Difference = import-side data in digit \u03b1 \u2013 export-side data in digit \u03b1 \n\nis  especially  helpful \n\n \n \n3.2.   Methodology to Assess Direction Misclassifications \n \nThe  multiple  mirror  comparison \nin  examining  direction \nmisclassification  committed  by  the  customs  office  of  one  side.  For  example,  if  a  test \ncountry\u2019s  export  data  to  Country  A  for  Commodity  X  is  much  larger  than  its  mirror,  we \ncannot  make  a  definitive  argument  on  which  side  is  inaccurate.  However,  when  a  test \ncountry\u2019s export data to Country A for Commodity X is much larger than its mirror, and at \nthe  same  time,  a  test  country\u2019s  export  data  to  Country  B  for  Commodity  X  is  much \nsmaller  than  its  mirror,  there  is  a  strong  possibility  that  the  test  country  erroneously \nrecorded  its  Commodity  X  exports  to  Country  B  (the  actual  destination)  as  exports  to \nCountry A instead.  \n \nIn short, we first need to identify Country A and Country B, and then identify Commodity \nX.  Accordingly,  the  assessment  of  direction  misclassification  by  the  multiple  mirror \ntechnique involves two steps.  \n \n\nStep 1. Compare a test country's bilateral trade data with its major partners' bilateral \ntrade statistics at the aggregate level and identify a seeming set of false and actual \ndestination  countries  whose  trade  with  the  test  country  generates  discrepancies  in \nopposing directions (positive and negative discrepancies).  \n\nStep  2.  Compare  a  test  country\u2019s  bilateral  trade  with  a  possible  false-origin \ndestination  and  a  test  country\u2019s  bilateral  trade  with  a  possible  actual  origin  or \ndestination  at  the  2-digit  commodity  level  and  examine  whether  there  are  common \nasymmetric commodity groups with discrepancies in different directions.18 \n\n \n3.3.   Methodology to Assess Commodity Misclassifications \n \nThe multiple mirror comparison is also useful to examine commodity misclassification. If \na  test  country  has  a  record  of  Commodity  X  export  but  not  Commodity  X\u2019  export  to \nCountry A, while country A has a record of Commodity X\u2019 import but not Commodity  X \nimport  from  the  test  country,  it  is  difficult  to  conclude  which  customs  office  (the  test \ncountry\u2019s or that of Country A) has committed commodity misclassification. However, if a \ntest  country  has  a  record  of  Commodity  X  export  but  not  Commodity  X\u2019  export  to  both \nCountry A and B, while both Country A and B have a record of Commodity X\u2019 import but \nnot  Commodity  X  import  from  the  test  country,  we  can  infer  that  commodity \nmisclassification is likely to be committed by the test country.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18 \n\nIf  a  certain  transit  country  has  a  negative  discrepancy  when  compared  with  a  test  country  while  the \nsupposed actual destination has a positive discrepancy, it is inferred that the destination of goods are \nmisclassified. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\nIn short, we should first identify Commodity X and X\u2019, then examine how trade partners \n(Country A and Country B) classify Commodity X or X\u2019. Accordingly, the assessment of \ncommodity misclassification by the multiple mirror technique involves two steps.  \n \n\nStep 1. Compare the discrepancy between a test country\u2019s exports or imports to or \nfrom the rest of the world and the rest of the world\u2019s imports or exports from or to a \ntest  country  at  the  commodity  level.  Then,  identify  asymmetric  commodity  groups \nand  find  a  set  of  similar  asymmetric  commodity  groups  with  discrepancies  in \nopposing directions (negative vs. positive).  \n\nStep  2.  Examine  if  all  major  trade  partners  simultaneously  classify  the  concerned \ntraded goods in a different manner than a test country. \n \n \n\n3.4.   Data Source \n \nThe  study  uses  data  from  the  United  Nations  Commodity  Trade  Statistics  Database \n(UN Comtrade)  because  of  the  database\u2019s  comprehensiveness.  Trade  value  data  in \nUnited States (US) dollars at the aggregate and 2-digit levels are used. Although it would \nbe ideal to use trade volume data, given that trade value is influenced by the CIF\u2013FOB \nfactor since exports are reported in FOB while imports are reported in CIF, trade value is \nthe  only  available  data  at  the  aggregate  level.  HS  2002-based  figures  are  used  for \n2000\u20132004 and 2008 because these were the only available data in the UN Comtrade \ndatabase.  \n \nAlthough all countries have export and import data to and from the rest of the world (total \nexports  and  imports),  there  is  no  readily  available  mirror  data  compiled  by  a  single \nauthority. However, comparing one country\u2019s total exports and imports with its mirror is \nvery  helpful  in  understanding  the  overall  quality  of  that  country\u2019s  trade  statistics. \nTherefore,  we  use  the  aggregate  import\u2013export  data  of  all  countries  (other  than  the \nconcerned  country)  included  in  the  UN  Comtrade  database  to  produce  the  mirror  data \nfor the concerned country. \n \n \n4.   Examination of Cambodia\u2019s Export Statistics  \n \nThe  quality  of  data  on  Cambodia\u2019s  total  exports  to  the  world  appears  to  be  good.  The \nimport\u2013export ratios for each year in 2000\u20132004 and 2008 range around 1.1 (Table 2). \nThis implies that the overall quality of Cambodia\u2019s export data is acceptable, while there \nmay be some problems at the disaggregated level.  \n \n4.1.   Possible Direction Misclassifications among Cambodia\u2019s Exports \n \nCambodia's  exports  to  major  trade  partners  at  the  aggregate  level.  Cambodia\u2019s \nimportant  export  partners  in  2008  are  examined  in  the  analysis  to  investigate  the \npossibility  of  direction  misclassification.

This  huge  discrepancy  between  Cambodian  exports  to  Hong Kong, \nChina and Hong Kong, China\u2019s imports from Cambodia is likely due to the fact that Hong \nKong, China is not a transit port for a single destination but is a transit port for a number \nof destinations such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, and the US, which \nall  have  ratios  greater  than  1.1  (i.e.,  Cambodia\u2019s  exports  to  these  trade  partners  are \nsmaller  than  these  partners\u2019  imports  from  Cambodia).

Furthermore, the data from the US, Japan, and the PRC \nshow that there were such imports from Cambodia. For example, while the Cambodian \ndata  show  that  there  were  no  exports  of  HS  40  and  65  to  Japan,  the  Japanese  data \nshow  that  there  were  HS  40  and  65  imports  from  Cambodia.

Table 5 \npresents asymmetric commodity groups in Cambodia\u2019s exports to the world against the \nworld\u2019s imports from Cambodia. There are several commodity groups that continuously \nappear as asymmetric (see commodities underlined in Table 5).  \n \nAt  a  glance,  we  cannot  confirm  any  improvement  in  commodity  misclassifications  in \nrecent  years.  The  number  of  asymmetric  commodity  groups  has  not  changed  much. \nWhile  there  were  29  asymmetric  commodity  groups  in  2000  (16  \u201cno  data  on  one  side\u201d \ngroups  and  13  \u201clarge  discrepancy\u201d  groups),  there  were  30  asymmetric  commodity \ngroups in 2008 (12 \u201cno data on one side\u201d groups and 18 \u201clarge discrepancy\u201d groups). \n \nOn  wood-related  items,  Cambodia\u2019s  exports  to  the  rest  of  the  world  were  consistently \nsmaller than the rest of the world\u2019s imports from Cambodia in terms of HS 44 (wood and \narticles  of  wood,  wood  charcoal).  On  the  other  hand,  in  terms  of  HS  94  (furniture, \nlighting, signs, prefabricated buildings), Cambodia\u2019s exports to the rest of the world were \nconsistently  larger  than  the  rest  of  the  world\u2019s  imports  from  Cambodia.  Given  the \nsimilarity  between  the  two  groups,  it  can  be  inferred  that  Cambodia  may  have \nmisclassified exports in HS 44 as exports in HS 94.

If  this  was  the  case,  the  situation  is  similar  to  the  wood-related \nproducts mentioned above; while Cambodian customs officials considered these exports \nto be intermediate products (HS 55), importing countries regarded them as raw materials \n(HS 52). \n \nCambodia's exports by major commodity groups at the bilateral level.

For  example, \ntrade statistics from the US, Japan, and the PRC all show that they have a large volume \nof  HS 44  imports  from  Cambodia  (see  commodities  in  shadow  in  Table  4).

It  is  also  reasonable  to  infer  in  this  instance  that \nCambodia\u2019s  commodity  classification  was  inaccurate  (garment-related  exports  are \nincorrectly  recorded  as  HS  55  instead  of  HS  52),  rather  than  considering  that  the  US, \nJapan, and the PRC simultaneously committed the same commodity misclassification.  \n \n \n5.   Examination of Cambodia\u2019s Import Statistics  \n \nAs  far  as  Cambodia\u2019s  total  imports  from  the  world  are  concerned,  the  data  quality \nappears  to  be  poor.  The  import\u2013export  ratios  fell  significantly  below  1.1  in  2000\u20132004 \nand  2008  (Table  6).  There  should  be  concern  over  the  quality  of  Cambodia\u2019s  import \ndata,  especially  since  import  data  are  used  for  purposes  of  tariff  revenue  collection, \ntaxes,  trade  agreements,  and  other  regulatory  controls.  Thus,  the  data  should  be \naccurate  and  reliable.  Moreover,  there  is  a  clear  declining  trend  in  the  import\u2013export \nratios. This implies that over time either the difference between Cambodia\u2019s imports and \nits  partners\u2019  exports  expanded  or  the  mismatch  in  the  data  worsened.  From  the  trade \nand  domestic  policy  perspective,  this  sketch  of  data  quality  calls  for  improvements  in \ndata  reporting.  A  smaller  import  value  compared  with  a  partner\u2019s  export  value  implies \nthat some imports were inaccurately recorded due to, for example, issues of corruption. \n \n5.1.

Given  that  these \ncountries both share a land border with Cambodia, it is probable that the discrepancies \nwere  caused  not  by  transit  trade  but  by  other  reasons  such  as  informal  trade.  For \nexample, if Cambodian custom officials erroneously recorded goods from a third country \nas  goods  from  a  neighboring  transit  country,  then  the  import\u2013export  ratio  with  such  a \ntransiting country would become much higher than 1.1.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\nOn the other hand, the US has import\u2013export ratios with Cambodia that are greater than \n1.1, which means that Cambodia\u2019s imports from the US were significantly larger than US \nexports to Cambodia. Quite possibly, a third country\u2019s exports to Cambodia via the US \nwere  recorded  as  imports  from  the  US  by  Cambodian  customs,  resulting  in  a  large \ndiscrepancy  in  the  import\u2013export  ratio.  However,  in  reality,  there  is  no  reasonable \nscenario under which an origin country at a distance from Cambodia greater than that of \nthe  US  would  use  US  ports  for  transit  purposes.  Rather,  this  high  ratio  may  be  due  to \ninaccuracies in the US data. Cambodia\u2019s imports from the US did pass through a transit \nport  and  the  US  recorded  the  goods  as  exports  to  the  transit  port  rather  than  to \nCambodia, resulting in Cambodia\u2019s imports from the US being larger than US exports to \nCambodia. In addition, US exporters may have some incentive to misreport that goods \nwere not exported to Cambodia.  \n \nBecause  the  import\u2013export  ratio  of  Cambodia\u2019s  total  imports  was  very  low  in  2008 \n(0.66),  we  can  say  that  the  import\u2013export  ratios  of  almost  all  its  trade  partners  have  a \ndownward  bias.  If  we  examine  this  downward  bias,  we  can  see  that  the  ratios  of  two \ntransit economies, namely, Hong Kong, China and the Republic of Korea, are relatively \nlarge. Given the geographical location of the Republic of Korea and the fact that Japan, \nwhich has a small import\u2013export ratio even after taking into account the downward bias, \nwe can infer that Cambodia\u2019s imports from Japan were in part misclassified as imports \nfrom the Republic of Korea.    \n \nCambodia\u2019s  imports  from  Japan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  (Japan\u2013Republic  of \nKorea\u2013Cambodia  route)  at  the  2-digit  commodity  level.

Theoretically  speaking, \nhowever,  it  is  still  difficult  to  conclude  which side  (Cambodia  or  the  Republic of  Korea) \ncommitted commodity misclassification if we only conduct a bilateral mirror comparison. \n \nHowever,  if  we  compare  the  mirror  analysis  between  Cambodia  and  the  Republic  of \nKorea with the mirror analysis between Cambodia and Japan, more plausible inferences \non  the  direction  misclassification  can  be  made.  In  Table  8,  we  observe  that  there  are \nseveral  commodity  groups  wherein  Cambodia\u2019s  imports  from  the  Republic  of  Korea \nappear  significantly  larger  than  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  exports  to  Cambodia.  At  the \nsame  time,  Cambodia\u2019s  imports  of  the  same  commodity  groups  from  Japan  appear \nsignificantly smaller  than  Japan\u2019s  exports  to  Cambodia  (see  commodities  underlined  in \nTable  8).  This  implies  that  these  commodity  groups  may  have  been  misclassified  by \nCambodia as imports from the Republic of Korea rather than imports from Japan.  \n \nIn 2008, most commodities that Cambodia\u2019s data showed as imported from the Republic \nof  Korea  in  large  quantities  and  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  data  showed  either  no  or  few \nsuch  commodities  being  exported  to  Cambodia  were  the  same  commodities  for  which \n\n \n\n\fUtilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   19 \n\nCambodia  recorded  either  no  or  few  imports  from  Japan  while  the  Japanese  data \nshowed  large  quantities  of  such  exports  to  Cambodia.  More  specifically,  while  the \nCambodian data show that there were no or few imports in HS 15, 40, 55, and 89 from \nJapan,  the  Japanese  data  showed  that  there  were  larger  quantities  of  these \ncommodities exported to Cambodia. Accordingly, it is reasonable to infer that Cambodia \nerroneously recorded imports in HS 15, 40, 55, and 89 from Japan as imports from the \nRepublic  of  Korea,  rather  than  assuming  that  Japan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea \nsimultaneously committed misclassification.   \n \n \n\nTable 8: Japan\u2013Republic of Korea\u2013Cambodia Trade Route, 2000\u20132004 and \n2008  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2008 \n\nAsymmetric \ngroups in \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports \nfrom the \nRepublic of \nKorea \n \n \n \n \n\nNo Data on One \nSide Cambodia\u2019s \nimports from the \nRepublic of Korea \nnot reported by the \nRepublic of Korea \nas exports to \nCambodia \n\n16, 20, \n21, 25, \n27, 35, \n45, 57, \n70, 71, \n74, 99 \n\n25, 27, \n28, 35, \n57, 67, \n68, 69, \n74, 88, \n99 \n\n04, 07, \n09, 11, \n12, 20, \n21, 25, \n27, 35, \n36, 42, \n57, 64, \n66, 69, \n82, 86, \n97, 99 \n\n11, 13, \n21, 25, \n42, 44, \n45, 67, \n68, 69, \n99 \n\n09, 10, \n11,12, \n21, 31, \n43, 57, \n69, 78, \n81, 99 \n\n04, 10, \n15, 18, \n23, 43, \n57, 66, \n67, 97 \n\n42, 55,  \n\n55, 56 \n\n55, 96 \n\n55, 56 \n\n55 \n\n40, 55, \n76, 83, \n89, 90 \n\nAsymmetric \ngroups in \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports \nfrom Japan \n\n52, 59, \n67 \n\n06, 74 \n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n15, 22, \n26, 78 \n\n52, 89, \n95, 99 \n\n10, 16, \n69, 70, \n82, 89, \n95, 99 \n\n16, 30, \n52, 54, \n59, 89, \n99 \n\n30, 38, \n52, 54, \n56, 59, \n76, 82, \n89, 99 \n\n29, 54, \n59, 89, \n95, 99 \n\n29, 40, \n54, 55, \n84, 89, \n95, 96, \n99 \n\nPositive \nDiscrepancy \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports from the \nRepublic of Korea \nare greater than \nthe Republic of \nKorea\u2019s exports to \nCambodia \n\nNo Data on One \nSide Japan\u2019s \nexports to \nCambodia not \nreported by \nCambodia as \nimports from Japan \n\nNegative \nDiscrepancy \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports from \nJapan are less \nthan Japan\u2019s \nexports to \nCambodia \n\n \nSource: UN Comtrade database. \n\n \n\n\f20   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\nTable 9: Republic of Korea\u2013Japan\u2013Cambodia Trade Route,  \n2000\u20132004 and 2008   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2008 \n\nAsymmetric \ngroups in \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports \nfrom Japan \n\nNo Data on One \nSide \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports from \nJapan not reported \nby Japan as \nexports to \nCambodia \n\nAsymmetric \ngroups in \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports \nfrom the \nRepublic of \nKorea \n\nPositive \nDiscrepancy \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports from Japan \nare greater than \nJapan\u2019s exports to \nCambodia \n \n\nNo Data on One \nSide  \nRepublic of \nKorea\u2019s exports to \nCambodia not \nreported by \nCambodia as \nimports from the \nRepublic of Korea \n\nNegative \nDiscrepancy  \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports from the \nRepublic of Korea \nare less than the \nRepublic of \nKorea\u2019s exports to \nCambodia  \n\n10, 12, \n21, 24, \n28, 33, \n42, 45, \n61, 62, \n65, 66, \n79, 80, \n86, 92, \n97 \n\n03, 05, \n07, 08, \n09, 11, \n12, 17, \n19, 20, \n24, 36, \n41, 42, \n61, 71, \n74, 80, \n81, 86, \n91, 92 \n\n37, 39, \n48, 49, \n90, 94 \n\n37, 38, \n70, 82, \n87, 90 \n\n07, 12, \n15, 19, \n20, 21, \n22, 24, \n25, 26, \n28, 31, \n45, 46, \n48, 58, \n62, 65, \n66, 67, \n68, 71, \n76, 86, \n88, 91, \n92 \n\n49, 60, \n72, 87, \n90   \n\n04, 05, \n07, 09, \n10, 14, \n19, 20, \n21, 22, \n24, 31, \n33, 37, \n42, 46, \n57, 58, \n61, 65, \n66, 67, \n70, 74, \n80, 81, \n86, 91, \n97 \n39, 41, \n44, 49, \n55, 90 \n\n04, 08, \n10, 17, \n19, 21, \n24, 31, \n33, 57, \n61, 64, \n66, 97 \n\n03, 04, \n09, 11, \n12, 16, \n19, 20, \n21, 22, \n24, 25, \n27, 28, \n37, 42, \n46, 57, \n58, 65, \n66, 67, \n75, 86 \n\n10, 55, \n87,  96 \n\n56 \n\n24, 51, \n89 \n\n24, 71, \n53, 93 \n\n17, 51, \n53, 89, \n91, 92 \n\n50, 51, \n89 \n\n47, 53, \n75, 80 \n\n35, 50, \n51, 71, \n74, 75, \n89, 92 \n\n33, 41, \n52, 54, \n58, 59, \n60, 62, \n64, 65, \n73, 91 \n\n17, 33, \n48, 52, \n54, 58, \n59, 60, \n62, 65, \n70, 85, \n89, 91 \n\n41, 52, \n54, 58, \n59, 60, \n62, 65, \n72, 85, \n90 \n\n33, 39, \n41, 52, \n54, 58, \n59, 60, \n65, 70, \n90, 91,  \n\n24, 33, \n39, 41, \n52, 54, \n49, 58, \n62, 65, \n70, 72, \n84, 85, \n90 \n\n19, 22, \n24, 27, \n29, 33, \n35, 41, \n44, 52, \n56, 58, \n60, 61, \n62, 64, \n94 \n\n \nSource: UN Comtrade database.   \n \n \nCambodia\u2019s  imports  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  Japan  (Republic  of  Korea\u2013\nJapan\u2013Cambodia  route)  at  the  2-digit  commodity  level.  The  Republic  of  Korea\u2013\nJapan\u2013Cambodia  route  was  also  tested  to  determine  whether  commodity  groups  may \n\n \n\n\fUtilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   21 \n\nhave  been  misclassified  by  Cambodia  as  imports  from  Japan  rather  than  from  the \nRepublic of Korea. As shown in Table 9, there are a large number of commodity groups \nin  which  Cambodia\u2019s  imports  from  Japan  appear  larger  than  Japan\u2019s  exports  to \nCambodia.  At  the  same  time,  Cambodia\u2019s  imports  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  of  the \nsame  commodity  groups  appear  smaller  than  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  exports  to \nCambodia (see commodities underlined). \n \nIn 2008, most commodities in which Cambodia had a relatively large amount of imports \nfrom  Japan,  while  Japanese  statistics  showed  no  such  exports  to  Cambodia,  were  the \nsame commodities for which Cambodia recorded no imports from the Republic of Korea \nwhile the Republic of Korea did record such exports to Cambodia. Specifically, while the \nCambodian data for 2008 show that there were no or few imports in HS 19, 24, 33, 56, \n61, and 64 from the Republic of Korea, the Korean data show that there were exports of \nthose  commodities  to  Cambodia.  Accordingly,  it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  Cambodia \nerroneously  recorded  imports  in  HS  19,  24,  33,  56,  61,  and  64  from  the  Republic  of \nKorea  as  imports  from  Japan,  rather  than  considering  that  Japan  and  the  Republic  of \nKorea simultaneously committed misclassification.   \n \nIn  summary,  there  are  commodity  groups  among  Cambodia\u2019s  imports  from  Japan  that \ntransit through the Republic of Korea and among its imports from the Republic of Korea \nthat  transit  through  Japan  which  were  misclassified  in  both  cases  as  imports  from  the \ntransiting country. With the two effects potentially cancelling each other out, the extent of \ndirection misclassification in Cambodia\u2019s imports from the Republic of Korea and Japan \nis  not  reflected  at  the  aggregate  level.  Thus,  the  2-digit  level  analysis  in  this  section \nreveals that there are many commodity misclassifications that are not observable at the \naggregate level. \n \n5.2.   Possible Commodity Misclassifications among Cambodia\u2019s Imports \n \nCambodia\u2019s imports by major commodity group at the aggregate level. This section \nexamines Cambodia\u2019s commodity misclassification of imports from the rest of the world. \nTable 10 presents asymmetric commodity groups in Cambodia\u2019s imports from the rest of \nthe  world  against  the  rest  of  the  world\u2019s  exports  to  Cambodia.  There  are  several \ncommodity groups that continuously appear as asymmetric (see commodities underlined \nin Table 10). \n \nAt  a  glance,  it  appears  that  the  discrepancy  at  the  2-digit  level  deteriorated  and  the \nnumber  of  asymmetric  commodity  groups  increased  during  the  years  under  review \n(2000\u20132004 and 2008). While there were 28 asymmetric commodity groups in 2000 (3 \n\u201cno  data  on  one  side\u201d  groups  and  25  \u201clarge  discrepancy\u201d  groups),  there  were  30 \nasymmetric commodity groups in 2008 (zero \u201cno data on one side\u201d groups and 30 \u201clarge \ndiscrepancy\u201d groups). Over time, there has been a declining number of matches in terms \nof  the  classification  of  goods.  In  other  words,  Cambodia  has  continued  to  classify \nexports  under  codes  that  are  different  than  the  codes  its  trade  partners  use  to  classify \nsuch goods. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f22   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\nTable 10: Asymmetric Commodity Groups in Cambodia's Trade with the  \nRest of the World, 2000\u20132004 and 2008 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2008 \n\n81 \n\n \n\n45 \n\n45, 81 \n\n47, 53 \n\n \n\nAsymmetric \ngroups \nwhere \nCambodia\u2019s \nimport data \nappear \ngreater than \nthe rest of \nthe world\u2019s \nexport data \n\nAsymmetric \ngroups \nwhere \nCambodia\u2019s \nimport data \nappear less \nthan the rest \nof the \nworld\u2019s \nexport data \n\nNo Data on One \nSide Cambodia\u2019s \nimports from the \nrest of the world \nnot reported by \nthe rest of the \nworld as exports \nto Cambodia \n\nPositive \nDiscrepancy \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports from the \nrest of the world \nare larger than \nthe rest of the \nworld\u2019s exports to \nCambodia \n\nNo Data on One \nSide Rest of the \nworld\u2019s exports to \nCambodia not \nreported by \nCambodia as \nimports from the \nrest of the world \n\nNegative \nDiscrepancy \nCambodia\u2019s \nimports from the \nrest of the world \nare smaller than \nthe rest of the \nworld\u2019s exports to \nCambodia \n\n41, 49, 55, \n62, 71 \n\n55, 62 \n\n55, 62  \n\n55, 62 \n\n28, 55, \n59, 62 \n\n28, 49, \n55, 59 \n\n26, 75 \n\n26, 53 \n\n51 \n\n26, 47, 75 \n\n \n\n \n\n03, 04, 15, \n19, 20, 21, \n22, 27, 32, \n33, 34, 37, \n51, 52, 53, \n59, 61, 91, \n95, 99 \n\n03, 04, \n19, 20, \n21, 22, \n32, 33, \n37, 51, \n52, 54, \n61, 68, \n99 \n\n03, 04, 07, \n08, 17, 19, \n20, 21, 22, \n31, 32, 33, \n34, 37, 38, \n39, 51, 52, \n59, 61, 64, \n72, 73, 82, \n88, 89, 95, \n99 \n\n03, 04, \n08, 12, \n16, 19, \n20, 21, \n22, 31, \n32, 33, \n34, 37, \n49, 52, \n54, 59, \n61, 64, \n68, 71, \n72, 89, \n99 \n\n04, 08, \n16, 17, \n19, 20, \n21, 22, \n31, 32, \n33, 37, \n38, 39, \n40, 51, \n52, 54, \n56, 61, \n64, 68, \n69, 70, \n72, 73, \n85, 89, \n95, 99 \n\n01, 03, \n04, 08, \n15, 16, \n17, 19, \n20, 21, \n22, 27, \n29, 31, \n32, 33, \n34, 39, \n40, 52, \n53, 54, \n56, 61, \n72, 73, \n82, 83, \n95, 99 \n\n \nSource: UN Comtrade database. \n \n \nOther  categories  in  which  Cambodia\u2019s  imports  from  the  rest  of  the  world  were \nconsistently  smaller  than  the  world\u2019s  exports  to  Cambodia  are  HS  4  (dairy  products, \neggs, honey, edible animal products), commodity groups relating to food such as HS 19 \n\n \n\n\fUtilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   23 \n\n(cereal,  flour,  starch,  milk  preparations  and  products),  HS  20  (vegetables,  fruits,  nuts, \nfood preparations), HS 21 (miscellaneous edible preparations), and HS 22 (beverages, \nspirits, vinegar); and commodity groups relating to chemicals  such as HS 32 (tanning, \ndyeing extracts, tannins, derived pigments), HS 33 (essential oils, perfumes, cosmetics, \ntoiletries),  HS  34  (soaps,  lubricants,  waxes,  candles,  modeling  pastes),  HS  37 \n(photographic or cinematographic goods) and HS 95 (toys, games, sports requisites). \n \nCambodia\u2019s imports by major commodity group at the bilateral level. The analysis \nabove, however, does not unambiguously indicate that the commodity misclassifications \nwere  indeed  committed  by  Cambodian  customs  officials.  If  we  look  at  various  bilateral \nmirror  analyses,  we  can  have  a  better  idea  of  which  party  committed  commodity \nmisclassification.  As  we  have  already  stated,  HS  51,  52,  and  59  are  the  commodity \ngroups  in  which  Cambodia  had  no  or  few  imports  from  the  rest  of  the  world  in  2000\u2013\n2004 and 2008, while there were large amounts of exports to Cambodia from the rest of \nthe  world  in  these  years.  Meanwhile,  the  lower  halves  of  Tables  8  and  9  display  the \ncommodity groups in which the Cambodian data show there are no or few imports from \nJapan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea,  while  the  Japanese  and  Korean  data  show  a  high \nvolume  of  exports  to  Cambodia  (see  commodities  in  shadow  in  Tables  8  and  9). \nInterestingly,  both  the  Japanese  and  Korean  data  suggest  that  they  exported  a  large \namount  of  items  under  HS  52  and  59.  Accordingly,  it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that \nCambodia\u2019s  commodity  classification  was  inaccurate,  with  Cambodia\u2019s  garment-related \nimports being incorrectly recorded as HS 55 and 62 instead of HS 51, 52, and 59, rather \nthan  considering  that  Japan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  simultaneously  committed  the \nsame commodity misclassification. \n \n \n6.   Conclusion \n \nThis  study  questioned  the  accuracy  of  trade  statistics  and  whether  the  observed \ndiscrepancies stem from two types of misclassification: commodity misclassification and \ndirection  misclassification.  It  examined  the  magnitude  of  the  two  misclassification \nproblems \nfundamental \nmethodological  problem  common  in  the  existing  literature  on  mirror  analysis  is  that  we \ncannot conclude which customs office, whether the exporting or the importing side, is the \nsource  of  a  discrepancy,  particularly  since  the  analysis  is  limited  to  a  bilateral \ncomparison  of  trade  partner  statistics.  In  order  to  overcome  this,  we  need  to  compare \nthe  results  of  a  bilateral  mirror  comparison  with  another  bilateral  mirror  comparison\u2019s \nresults.  By  using  a  multiple  mirror  technique  to  compare  discrepancies,  this  paper \ncarefully  examined  which  (i)  products  were  misclassified  under  similar  (but  ultimately \ndifferent) products, and (ii) goods to or from a country were misclassified as goods to or \nfrom another country.  \n \nWhile  the  discrepancies  among  Cambodia\u2019s  export  data  against  the  sum  of  all  of  its \ntrade  partners\u2019 \nthere  are  serious \nmisclassifications with regard to both direction and commodity type at the disaggregated \nlevel. While Cambodian statistics show that there were large amounts of exports to Hong \nKong,  China  in  several  commodities  in  2000\u20132004  and  2008,  the  statistics  from  Hong \nKong, China indicate no such imports. Interestingly, while Cambodia\u2019s data do not show \n\nimport  data  are  small  at \n\nthe  mirror  statistics.  The \n\ntrade  data  by  using \n\nlevel, \n\ntotal \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f24   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 88 \n\nthat  there  were  exports  of  those  same  commodities  to  the  US,  Japan,  and  the  PRC, \nthose  countries\u2019  statistics  indicate  that  there  were  imports  of  those  commodities  from \nCambodia. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that there has been direction misclassification \nin  Cambodia\u2019s  export  data.  Cambodia\u2019s  export  data  also  has  commodity \nmisclassifications.  While  the  Cambodian  statistics  say  that  there  were  HS  94  exports \n(furniture,  lighting,  signs,  prefabricated  buildings)  but  no  HS  44  exports  (wood  and \narticles of wood, wood charcoal) exports in 2000\u20132004 and 2008, all of its major training \npartners\u2019 statistics indicate HS 44 imports from Cambodia but no HS 94 imports.  \n \nThe  overall  quality  of  Cambodia\u2019s  import  data  is  much  worse  than  its  export  data.  The \ntotal of Cambodia\u2019s imports was only about half the sum of its trade partners\u2019 exports to \nCambodia  in  2000\u20132004  and  2008,  even  when  considering  the  CIF\u2013FOB  difference. \nThus,  in  addition  to  misclassifications,  there  are  other  factors  that  contribute  to  the \ndeterioration  of  the  quality  of  import  statistics  such  as  smuggling.  It  is  reasonable  to \nconsider that the quality of import data is worse than export data because the former is \ndirectly  related  to  tariff  revenue.  It  is  probable  that  the  magnitude  of  direction \nmisclassification  is  considerable.  In  the  case  of  trade  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  and \nJapan, goods coming from Japan were often classified as imports from the Republic of \nKorea  and  vice  versa.  (The  trade  statistics  of  Japan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  are \nconsistent with each other). Thus, there is substantial direction misclassification, which is \nnot  reflected  at  the  aggregate  level.  Commodity  misclassification  problems  are  also \npresent  in  Cambodia\u2019s  import  data.  A  number  of  Cambodia\u2019s  trade  partners\u2019  statistics \nindicate that there were exports to Cambodia in HS 51 (wool, animal hair, horsehair yarn \nand fabric thereof), 52 (cotton), and 59 (impregnated, coated, or laminated textile fabric), \nrather than in HS 55 (manmade staple fibers) or 62 (articles of apparel, accessories, not \nknit or crochet), while the Cambodian data shows the latter is the case.       \n \nFinally, improving the quality of trade statistics has practical importance for all countries, \nespecially  LDCs  such  as  Cambodia.  One  potential  way  to  improve  data  collection  and \ncompilation  is  by  engaging  in  technical  assistance  from  international  organizations \nspecializing in customs administration, such as the World Customs Organization (WCO), \nfor  the  recording  of  goods  using  the  HS  classification  system.  Cambodia  can  also \nconsider  the  quality  dimensions  set  out  in  the  IMF\u2019s  Data  Quality  Assessment \nFramework,  which  identifies  quality-related  features  of  the  governance  of  statistical \nsystems,  processes,  and  products.  The  quality  dimensions  include  assurance  of \nintegrity,  methodological  soundness,  accuracy  and  reliability,  serviceability,  and \naccessibility  (IMF 2003).19  International  institutions  specializing  in  economic  monitoring \nsuch  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations (ASEAN) can also assist in the development of data reporting systems. \n \n\n                                                 \n19  While  Cambodia  is  not  a  member,  the  principles  set  out  in  the  European  Statistics  Code  of  Practice \nadopted  by  the  Statistical  Programme  Committee  of  the  European  Council  in  2005  are  also  useful  in \nimproving the quality of statistics. The Code is a set of guidelines that Cambodia can use to improve the \nquality  of  its  trade  statistics.  The  principles  include  professional  independence,  mandate  for  data \ncollection,  adequacy  of  resources,  quality  commitment,  statistical  confidentiality,  impartiality  and \nobjectivity,  sound  methodology,  appropriate  statistical  procedures,  non-excessive  burden  on \nrespondents,  cost  effectiveness,  relevance,  accuracy  and  reliability,  timeliness  and  punctuality, \ncoherence and comparability, and accessibility and clarity (European Statistics Code of Practice 2005). \n\n \n\n\fUtilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess the Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics   |   25 \n\nReferences \n \n\nEuropean \n\nAvailable \nhttp://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/quality/code_of_practice \n\nStatistics \n\nPractice. \n\n2005. \n\nCode \n\nof \n\nat   \n\nEurostat.  2009.

By employing a multiple mirror technique (comparison of the results of various \nbilateral mirror analyses), the paper identifies the magnitude of direction and commodity \nmisclassification in trade statistics.  \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite \nthe region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion \npeople who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. \nADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \n\ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No. WPS114032  \n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "ADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration\n", "Utilizing the Multiple Mirror Technique to Assess \nthe Quality of Cambodian Trade Statistics\n", "Shintaro Hamanaka+ \n", "No. 88       October 2011\n", "The  author  is  grateful  for  valuable  comments  from \nHaruya  Koide  and  research  assistance  of  Aiken \nTafgar.\n", "+Shintaro Hamanaka is Economist, Office of Regional \nEconomic  Integration,  Asian  Development  Bank,  6 \nADB Avenue,  Mandaluyong  City,  1550  Metro  Manila, \nPhilippines.
