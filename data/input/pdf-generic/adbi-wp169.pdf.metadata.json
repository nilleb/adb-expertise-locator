INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) have long played an important role in supplying parts \nand  components  to  large  enterprises  (LEs)  in  Japan  through  subcontracting.  However,  the \nrelationship between LEs and SMEs has changed under the long-term recession since 1991. \nThe  streamlining  of  procurement  by  the  LEs  led  to  the  selection  of  only  the  efficient \nsubcontractors.  While  efficient  SMEs  can  get  more  orders  and  can  invest  to  improve  their \ncapacity, the inefficient ones lost business opportunities. During the long-term recession, the \nso-called  \u201cthree  excesses\u201d\u2014excess  debt,  excess  capacity,  and  excess  employment\u2014had \nput a burden on all enterprises including SMEs. This paper examines the trends of the three \nexcesses in SMEs. \n\nSME  policies  need  to  be  reviewed  both  from  the  industrial  policy  and  regional  policy \nstandpoints.  Industrial  clusters  can  also  be  grouped  into  four  types  according  to  how  they \nwere  formed  historically  and  according  to  their  characteristics.  This  paper  investigates  the \ntrends  and  characteristics  of  four  types  of  industrial  clusters.  Although  the  number  of \nestablishments  has  declined  in  all  types  of  industrial  clusters,  some  clusters  are  trying  to \nactivate local economy by diversifying their businesses and converting to high value-added \nareas. \n\nSME  policies  in  Japan have  been  modified  to  adjust  to  changing  economic  situations.  The \npolicy concept had already been changed from modernization to business conversion in the \n1980s.  Moreover,  business  innovations  and  start-ups  were  encouraged  in  the  1990s.  The \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Basic Law was revised fundamentally in 1999. The previous \nlaw  defined companies with  capital of  less  than  100  million  yen  (\u00a5)  or employing  less  than \n301 employees as SMEs. The revised law raised the capital size of SMEs from \u00a5100 million \nto \u00a5300 million. This paper is based on the definition of the previous law. \n\nThe  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  come  up  with  policy  recommendations  to  support \nmanufacturing  SMEs  based  on \ntrends  among  SMEs.  These \nrecommendations are presented in the conclusion. \n\nthe  analysis  of \n\n2.  THE FUTURE OF JAPANESE SMES \n\n2.1  Subcontracting \n\nIn Japan, a multi-tier subcontracting system based on specialization was established to help \ndevelop  the  supporting industry  during  the  rapid  economic  growth  period  in  the  1960s  and \n1970s. The supporting industry is defined as the industry that supports assembly industries, \nsuch as electrical machinery and automobiles, by supplying parts and components, die, and \nmold.  SMEs  are  main  players  in  the  supporting  industry.1  As  the  technology  available  to \nassemblers improved, so did that of SMEs in the supporting industry. An efficient division of \nlabor  between  SMEs  and  LEs  has  been  established  in  the  electrical  machinery  and \nautomobile  industries.  Subcontracting  has  contributed  to  the  improvement  of  production \nefficiency in the Japanese manufacturing sector. Urata and Kawai (2001) credited the growth \nof  total  factor  productivity  (TFP)  in  the  Japanese  manufacturing  sector  between  1972  and \n1986  to  active  patent  introduction  and  active  participation  in  subcontracting.  Although  the \nmulti-tier  subcontracting  system  has  been  changing,  the  efficient  division  of  labor  between \nSMEs and LEs is still working. This system can be considered a factor in the improvement of \nthe  production  efficiency  and  competitiveness  of  Japanese  manufacturing.  Typical \nsubcontracting is observed in the electrical machinery and automobile industries. This paper \n\n                                                 \n1 SMEs  in  the  supporting  industry  belong  to  various  categories  of  industrial  classification,  such  as \n\nchemicals, non-metallic mineral products, basic metals, and metal products. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nfocuses  on  subcontracting  in  general  machinery,  electrical  machinery,  transportation \nequipment,  and  precision  machinery.  These  industries  accounted  for  46%  of  the  value \nadded of the manufacturing sector in 2007. \n\nIn  Japan,  major  electrical  machinery  and  automobile  companies  procure  parts  and \ncomponents  from  three  sources.  First,  they  produce  parts  and  components  in  their  own \nfactories  using  their  own  staff  or  resources.  Second,  they  purchase  parts  and  components \nfrom  the  market.  The  transactions  with  suppliers  depend  on  market  prices  and  are  usually \nshort term in nature. Third, they purchase parts and components from subcontractors based \non  long-term  commitments.  Economic  theories  try  to  explain  why  subcontracting  is  an \nefficient method of procurement for assemblers. Kimura (2001) summarized the theoretical \nfoundation  of  subcontracting  in  terms  of  transaction  cost,  game  theory,  economics  of \ninformation, and network approaches, and pointed out that technological characteristics are \nthe key for an industry to develop a subcontracting system. LEs choose subcontracting when \nthe  upstream  production  requires  specialized  technology.  This  argument  is  based  on  the \npremise that efficient and reliable SMEs are available in Japan. \n\nFigure  1  shows  the  typical  four-tier  structure  of  subcontracting.  In  the  top  tier  are  the  LEs, \nwhich  include  not  only  assemblers  of  electrical  appliances  and  automobiles,  but  also \nmanufacturers  of  complete  components.  Some  automobile  component  manufacturers  are \nmultinational enterprises, and their capital size is larger than that of automobile assemblers.2 \nLarge  electrical  machinery  companies  supply  auto  components  to  automobile  assemblers. \nTransactions  among  LEs  in  the  top  tier  are  not  subcontracting.  LEs  have  factories \nassembling  products  in  different  areas.  Clusters  of  SMEs  specializing  in  specific  products \nhave  been  formed  to  supply  the  factories  of  the  LEs.  The  rise  and  fall  of  these  clusters \ndepend on the condition of the factories that function as the core of the clusters. \n\nFigure 1: Structure of Subcontracting \n\n \n\n   \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nF i r s t   T i e r \nL E s \n\nSecond Tier\nL a r g e   a n d   M e d i u m   \n\nT h i r d   T i e r \nS m a l l     a n d   M e d i u m \nF \n\nFourth Tier\nT i n y   a n d   S m a l l   E n t e r p r i s e s \n\nSource: Author. \n\n \n\nIn  the  second  tier  are  the  medium  and  large  enterprises  that  assemble  components  and \nsupply  them  to  LEs  in  the  first  tier.  The  enterprises  in  the  second  tier  have  three  common \nabilities. First, they have specialized technology that others cannot imitate. Second, they can \nplay the role of coordinator of SMEs. The enterprises in the second tier procure parts from \nSMEs  in  the  third  tier  and  assemble  them.  As  they  can  control  the  quality  and  delivery  of \n\n                                                 \n2 The  common  stock  of  Denso  (an  automobile  component  manufacturer)  was  pegged  at  \u00a5187.4 \nmillion on 31 March 2007 while Suzuki\u2019s (an automobile assembler) was \u00a5120 million on the same \nday. \n\n \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\ncomponents  and,  therefore,  can  reduce  total  production  costs,  LEs  benefit  from  this \nrelationship by saving on overhead costs associated with controlling and coordinating SMEs. \nIn  the  case  of  Toyota,  while  the  company  is  indirectly  linked  with  more  than  30,000 \nenterprises,  it  also  has  direct  transactions  with  hundreds  of  enterprises.  Third,  they  have \ndesign ability. It is common for LEs to give rough designs to the enterprises in the second \ntier,  which  then  draw  up  the  specifications.  In  many  cases,  enterprises  in  the  first  and \nsecond tiers co-develop components for new products (Yoshida 1997). \n\nMeanwhile, SMEs in the third tier specialize in specific processes and produce parts. They \nare also expected to meet demands on cost, quality, and delivery from their customers. Tiny \nand  small  enterprises  in  the  fourth  tier  are  mostly  family  owned  and  managed,  and  take \ncharge  of  relatively  simple  processes  at  low  margins.  Due  to  their  size,  the  management \nbase of enterprises in the third and fourth tiers are generally weak. \n\nThere  is  a  significant  gap  between  wages  in  LEs  in  the  first  tier  and  those  of  SMEs  in  the \nthird  and  fourth  tiers.  In  2007,  while  the  per  capita  annual  value  of  total  cash  wages  and \nsalaries  was  \u00a53  million  in  enterprises  employing  four  to  nine  people,  those  of  enterprises \nemploying  1,000  or  more  persons  was  \u00a56.7  million  (Government  of  Japan,  Ministry  of \nEconomy, Trade, and Industry 2009). LEs can save on labor costs by subcontracting. More \nimportant,  however,  is  that  subcontracting  is  dependent  on  specialization  (e.g.,  in  part  and \ncomponent production) in the electrical machinery and automobile industries. \n\n2.2  Relation-Specific Skills \n\nSubcontracting  does  not  necessarily  entail  a  rigid  and  exclusive  contract.  Electrical \nmachinery and automobile companies produce many models and change models regularly. \nSpecifications  for  each  part  of  the  new  model  as  well  as  the  price  thereof  are  determined \nduring the development period prior to the model change. Once a subcontractor receives an \norder for a part (when the commercial production of a new model is launched), the order is \nnormally renewed or continued. There is a tendency for LEs to assign the responsibility for \nsupplying a part for a specific model to a single subcontractor to avoid duplicate investment. \nBut,  when  the  life  of  a  given  model  comes  to  an  end,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  a \nsubcontractor  that  has  been  supplying  a  part  for  that  model  will  receive  an  order  for  the \nsame kind of part for the new model. \n\nSubcontractors must meet the demands of a parent company at three critical points: (i) price \nreduction  by  some  targeted  percentage  within  a  certain  time  span,  reflecting  efforts  to \nreduce  costs;  (ii)  high  reliability  in  quality  assurance;  and  (iii)  high  reliability  in  keeping  up \nwith  the  delivery  schedule.  On  the  other  hand,  parent  companies  support  improvements  in \nproduction  efficiency  by  subcontractors  through  technical  assistance,  such  as  training \nsubcontractors\u2019  employees  and  dispatching  engineers \nfactories. \nMoreover, learning through repeated interactions with a particular parent company results in \nnew  skills  being  developed \nthat \nto \nsubcontractors  accumulate.  Asanuma  (1989)  referred  to  this  accumulated  learning  as  a \nrelation-specific skill and noted that it usually leads to competitive spot bidding on the part of \nthe subcontractors if the transaction is repeated often enough over a certain period.3 \n\ntechnological  capability \n\nto  subcontractors\u2019 \n\nin  addition \n\nthe  basic \n\n2.3  Changes in the Subcontracting System \n\nJapan\u2019s  subcontracting  system  has  changed  during  the  long-term  recession  that  began  in \nincluding  major  complete  component \n1991.  Japanese  automobile  companies, \n\n                                                 \n3 Asanuma  focused  on  the  relations  between  typical  LEs  that  manufacture  the  final  products  of  the \nautomobile  and  electrical  machinery  industries  and  the  companies  that  supply  repeatedly \ntransacted parts. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nmanufacturers, have changed their procurement strategies in three ways and have reduced \ntransactions with subcontractors. \n\nFirst,  they  began  to  procure  components  from  subcontractors  under  different  parent \ncompanies. Cross-group transactions became common in the Japanese market. Moreover, \nautomobile companies gave up their strategy of producing all parts and components within \nthe same company groups. They sold their non-earning subcontracting companies to other \ncompanies and concentrated on their high-performing sections. \n\nSecond, automobile manufacturers reduced the number of components they use. During the \neconomic boom in the second half of the 1980s, they increased the number of models and \neven  included  different  components  within  the  same  model  to  attract  customers  through \nproduct distinction. Naturally, this raised the number of man-hours on the assembly line and \nthe  research  and  development  (R&D)  and  production  costs  of  components.  During  the \nrecession, however, manufacturers tried to use common components for different models to \nreduce the number of components. Moreover, some companies formed tie-ups with different \ncompanies  to  share  common  components.  As  the  reduction  of  items  encouraged  the \nincreased  and  component \nlot  production  of \nstandardization  of  components, \nmanufacturers  started \nfrom  economies  of  scale.  Meanwhile,  automobile \nassemblers  concentrated  on  efficient  component  manufacturers. 4   Hence,  inefficient \nmanufacturers began to lose clients. \n\nto  benefit \n\nitems \n\nThird,  large  automobile  and  component  manufacturers  increased  the  share  of  parts  and \ncomponents  they  produced  in-house.  They  did  this  for  several  reasons.  Reduced  demand \nduring  the  long-term  recession  made  many  laborers  redundant  and  their  capacity  was \nunderutilized. Thus, LEs that had been outsourcing the production of parts and components \nbegan  to  produce  them  in-house  to  use  redundant  laborers.  Also,  the  standardization  of \ncomponents  induced  by  the  reduction  of  items  made  production  of  components  in-house \nmore profitable due to economies of scale. The development of microelectronics reduced the \nrange of skills required\u2014a definite advantage for the SMEs. Quality control and production \nmanagement is easier to do in-house. As technology developments reduced the number of \nman-hours  needed  on  the  assembly  lines  in  LEs,  the  space  and  labor  needed  to  produce \nparts and components in-house became available (Yoshida 1997). \nA  similar  phenomenon  can  be  observed  in  the  electrical  machinery  industry. 5   The \nstreamlining  of  procurement  by  the  LEs  led  to  the  selection  of  only  the  most  efficient \nsubcontractors. LEs terminated transactions with inefficient subcontractors, possibly leading \nto the observed bipolarization among SMEs. \n\nThe  change  in  LE  procurement  policies  made  subcontracting  between  LEs  and  SMEs \nunstable.  In  some  cases,  parent  companies  made  unfair  demands  of  subcontractors,  such \nas requiring them to reduce the prices of components after an agreement had been made. In \nother cases, contracts were terminated suddenly before the agreed upon date. \n\n2.4  Long-Term Downward Trends in Entry Rates \n\nThe number of manufacturing establishments employing four to 299 people steadily declined \nfrom 434,754 in 1985 to 254,675 in 2007. The sharp decline in the number of establishments \nwas  caused  not  only  by  the  abolishment  of  enterprises  but  also  by  the  lower  number  of \nenterprises entering the economy.  As shown in Figure 2,  the entry rate has experienced a \nprolonged  decline  since  the  1970s.  The  main  factor  behind this  appears  to  be  the  trend  in \nsole  proprietorships,  which  account  for  a  huge  number  of  Japanese  enterprises.  This \n\n                                                 \n4 In  1999,  Nissan  announced  its  procurement  policy  to  reduce  its  parts  and  components  suppliers \nfrom 1,145 to less than 600 before March 2002. \n5 In 2009, Sony announced its procurement policy to reduce its parts and components suppliers from \n2,500 to 1,200 before the end of 2010. \n\n \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nphenomenon, however, should not be regarded entirely as a problem of sole proprietorships \nbecause  they  have  the  potential  to grow  and  employ  more  people.  The  exit  rate  has  been \nhigher than the entry rate since 1989\u20131991. \n\nFigure 2: Trends in Entry and Exit Rates \n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n9\n6\n9\n1\n-\n6\n6\n9\n1\n\n2\n7\n9\n1\n-\n9\n6\n9\n1\n\n5\n7\n9\n1\n-\n2\n7\n9\n1\n\n8\n7\n9\n1\n-\n5\n7\n9\n1\n\n1\n8\n9\n1\n-\n8\n7\n9\n1\n\n6\n8\n9\n1\n-\n1\n8\n9\n1\n\n9\n8\n9\n1\n-\n6\n8\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n-\n9\n8\n9\n1\n\n4\n9\n9\n1\n-\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n-\n4\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n-\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n-\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n-\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\nEntry rate\n\nExit rate \n\nNote: The entry rate indicates (1) the average number of establishments launched during a particular period as a \nproportion of (2) the number of establishments already in existence at the start of the period, and is calculated by \ndividing (1) by (2).

It  regards  the  net \noperating  profit  of  each  establishment  as  employer  income.  The  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs \nand  Communications\u2019  Unincorporated  Enterprise  Survey  has  data  on  the  manufacturing \nsector\u2019s  average  net  operating  profit  per  establishment.  The  Ministry  of  Health,  Labor,  and \nWelfare\u2019s  Basic  Survey  on  Wage  Structure  also  has  data  on  the  sector\u2019s  average  annual \nincome of regular employees in establishments with more than nine regular personnel. The \nemployer-to-employee  income  ratio  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  average  annual  income  of \nregular  employees  by  the  average  net  operating  profit  per  establishment.  The  income  of \nemployees  has  risen  in  absolute  terms  in  enterprises  of  all  sizes  since  1974.  This  rise  is \nmore prominent than the rise in the absolute level of entrepreneurs' incomes. The downturn \nin entrepreneurs' incomes in the 1990s accelerated the decline of the employer-to-employee \nincome  ratio.  The  average  annual  net  operating  profit  per  establishment  went  down  from \n\u00a55.2 million in 1993 to \u00a53.1 million in 2006. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nFigure 3: Trends in Employer-to-Employee Income Ratio in Manufacturing \n\n(Ratio)\n2.20\n\n2.00\n\n1.80\n\n1.60\n\n1.40\n\n1.20\n\n1.00\n\n0.80\n\n0.60\n\n0.40\n\n3\n7\n9\n1\n\n5\n7\n9\n1\n\n7\n7\n9\n1\n\n9\n7\n9\n1\n\n1\n8\n9\n1\n\n3\n8\n9\n1\n\n5\n8\n9\n1\n\n7\n8\n9\n1\n\n9\n8\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n3\n9\n9\n1\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nNote: The employer-to-employee income ratio is calculated by dividing the average annual income per regular \n\nemployee by the average net operating profit per establishment. \n\nSources: SMEA (2005); Government of Japan, Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Basic Survey on Wage \nStructure (available: http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/database/db-l/index.html [accessed 19 November 2009]); \nGovernment of Japan, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Statistics Bureau, FY 2008 \nUnincorporated Enterprise Survey, Trend Survey (available: http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/ \nListE.do?lid=000001054597 [accessed 19 November 2009]). \n\n \n\nGenda and Kanbayashi (2002) analyzed the micro data and concluded that the probability of \nbeing self-employed decreased greatly among middle-aged workers in both urban and rural \nareas  from  1989  to  1994.  As  labor-intensive  processes  shifted  from  metropolitan  to  rural \nareas, many LEs and SMEs set up factories during the 1980s. Employment opportunities in \nfactories increased dramatically even in rural areas (Kato 2003). The relative decline in the \nincomes of self-employed workers appears to have reduced self-employment and decreased \nthe entry rate of businesses into the economy. \n\nMoreover, the younger generation has lost interest in setting up enterprises or joining family \nbusinesses  as  they  have  a  better  chance  of  getting  a  high,  stable  salary  elsewhere.  The \nopportunity cost of setting up a business varies according to each individual and time period. \nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the peak of the age-wage curve for SMEs was people in \ntheir thirties. Many SME entrepreneurs set up their own factories at this age because of their \nmeager salaries as employees (SMEA 1979). For many employees who did not have a high \nlevel of education, starting their own businesses was the better option as it was difficult for \nthem to get a job with a high, stable salary. Setting up their own businesses was a chance to \nimprove their incomes while using their skills. Today, this generation has reached retirement \nage, but many are still running their businesses due to the absence of successors. In 2007, \nfor  instance,  47%  of  self-employed  workers  in  the  Japanese  manufacturing  sector  were  at \nleast 60 years old (Figure 4). Many SMEs have already shut down their establishments and \nmore are likely to follow owing to the lack of successors to the top position. \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nFigure 4: Structure of Self-Employed Workers in Japanese Manufacturing,  \nAccording to Age \n\ns\nn\no\ns\nr\ne\nP\n\n \nf\no\n \nr\ne\nb\nm\nu\nN\n\n100,000\n\n80,000\n\n60,000\n\n40,000\n\n20,000\n\n0\n\n9\n1\n \no\nt\n \n5\n1\n\n4\n2\n \no\nt\n \n0\n2\n\n9\n2\n \no\nt\n \n5\n2\n\n4\n3\n \no\nt\n \n0\n3\n\n9\n3\n \no\nt\n \n5\n3\n\n4\n4\n \no\nt\n \n0\n4\n\n9\n4\n \no\nt\n \n5\n4\n\n4\n5\n \no\nt\n \n0\n5\n\n9\n5\n \no\nt\n \n5\n5\n\n4\n6\n \no\nt\n \n0\n6\n\n9\n6\n \no\nt\n \n5\n6\n\n4\n7\n \no\nt\n \n0\n7\n\n9\n7\n \no\nt\n \n5\n7\n\n4\n8\n \no\nt\n \n0\n8\n\nAges\n\ne\nv\no\nb\na\n \nd\nn\na\n5\n8\n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Government of Japan, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 2007 Employment Status Survey \n(available: http://www.e-stat.go.jp/estat/html/NewList/000001017285/NewList-000001017285.html [accessed 19 \nNovember 2009]). \n\nAdvanced machinery is necessary to meet the rising demands of customers. SMEs cannot \nmaintain their businesses without advanced technology and accumulated skills. Thus, entry \ninto manufacturing, particularly for the younger generation, has become more difficult\u2014and \ncostly\u2014than it was during the 1960s. In addition, Japanese SMEs are facing stiff competition \nfrom importers of cheap goods from overseas.  \n\n3.  IMPACTS OF LONG-TERM RECESSION \n\nThe  Japanese  economy  has  been  facing  long-term  recession  with  deflation  since  1991. \nAlthough  gross  domestic  product  growth  rates  recovered  slightly  in  the  mid-1990s,  they \nbecame  negative  in  1998  and  1999  (Figure  5).  Nonperforming  assets  became  a  serious \nproblem  in  those  years  and  SMEs  faced  financial  difficulties  due  to  the  non-availability  of \nbank  loans.  The  shrinking  domestic  market  affected  the  performance  of  the  manufacturing \nsector  and  enterprises  were  burdened  by  the  so-called  \u201cthree  excesses,\u201d  namely,  excess \ndebt, excess capacity, and excess employment. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nFigure 5: Gross Domestic Product Growth Rates \n\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n8.0\n\n6.0\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-4.0\n\n5\n8\n9\n1\n\n7\n8\n9\n1\n\n9\n8\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n3\n9\n9\n1\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\nSource: Government of Japan, Cabinet Office web site (available: \nhttp://www.esri.cao.go.jp/en/sna/qe093/gdemenuea.html [accessed 19 November 2009]). \n\n \n\nFigure 6 shows the interest-bearing debt redemption trend among SMEs and LEs between \n1986 and 2007. The period is estimated by dividing outstanding interest-bearing debt at the \nend of each quarter by annual cash flow. Outstanding interest-bearing debt consists of short-\nterm  borrowing,  long-term  borrowing,  and  corporate  bonds.  Cash  flow  is  calculated  by \nadding  half  of  the  annual  ordinary  profit  and  depreciation  expenses.  The  debt  redemption \nperiods  for  LEs  and  SMEs  were  5.7  and  6.2  years  at  the  end  of  the  first  quarter  of  1986. \nDuring the economic boom, the gap between SMEs and LEs was smaller. While recession \ndecreased ordinary profit, long-term debt rose continuously and the debt redemption period \nwent up rapidly in the second half of 1993. Banks did not want to restrict themselves from \nextending  loans  to  SMEs  simply  because  they  were  afraid  that  their  loans  would  become \nnonperforming assets. As a result, banks increased long-term loans to SMEs between 1990 \nand 1995 in spite of the recession. However, additional loans to avoid financial crunch made \nexcess debt in SMEs more serious. As long-term debt decreased in 2001, financial strength \nstarted to improve in 2003. But this does not mean that the financial conditions of all SMEs \nimproved.  Some  SME  went  bankrupt  with  the  accumulation  of  debt  and  ultimately \ndisappeared from the market. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nFigure 6: Trends in Debt Redemption Periods \n\n)\ns\nr\na\ne\nY\n\n \n\n(\n \ns\nd\no\ni\nr\ne\nP\nn\no\ni\nt\np\nm\ne\nd\ne\nR\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n6\n8\n9\n1\n\n9\n8\n9\n1\n\n2\n9\n9\n1\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\nLE\n\nSME\n\n \n\nLE = large enterprise, SME = small or medium enterprise. \n\nNotes:  \n1.

The year 1997 was a turning \npoint.  Table  1  suggests  that  small  establishments  have  declined.  The  number  of \nestablishments  employing  4\u201329  people  decreased  by  1.5%  per  annum  between  1985  and \n1997.  The  downward  trend  accelerated  after  1997.  During  the  recession  period,  many \nestablishments  closed  down.  The  number  of  smaller  establishments  decreased  faster  and \nthe number of establishments owned by LEs also went down. Although many factors caused \nthe decline in the number of SMEs, the long-term recession is still the main reason. Excess \ndebt  had  a  significant  effect  on  SMEs  during  the  recession  and  forced  many  SMEs  to  exit \nthe  market.  As  expected,  employment  in  SMEs  with  4\u2013299  employees  also  decreased  by \n1.2% per annum between 1985 and 1997. The decline became sharp after 1997. Because \nSMEs  accounted  for  a  large  share  of  manufacturing  establishments,  employment  in  this \nsector  went  down  significantly  after  1997.  The  exit  of  some  SMEs  might  have  led  to  a \nreduction  of  excess  capacity  and  excess  employment  in  SMEs.  Conversely,  labor \nproductivity has grown in all sizes of establishments in spite of negative or negligible growth \nbetween  1997  and  2007.  The  exit  of  inefficient  companies  might  have  actually  improved \nlabor productivity. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nTable 1: Trends of Manufacturing Establishments Employing  \nMore Than Three Employees, According to Size \n(%) \n\nNumber of \nEstablishments \n(1) \n\nNumber of \nEmployees \n(2) \n\nValue Added  \nat 2000 Prices** \n(3) \n\nLabor \nProductivity \n(3)/(2) \n\nSize (Number \nof Employees) \n\n4\u201329 \n\n30\u201399 \n\n100\u2013299 \n\n1985\u2013\n1997 \n\n-1.5 \n\n-0.3* \n\n0.2* \n\n1997\u2013 \n2007 \n\n-4.3 \n\n-2.4 \n\n-0.7 \n\n300 and above \n\nAll \n\n0* \n\n-0.6* \n\n-1.3 \n\n-3.9 \n\n1985\u2013\n1997 \n\n-1.2 \n\n-0.2* \n\n0.3* \n\n-0.3* \n\n-0.5* \n\n1997\u2013 \n2007 \n\n1985\u2013 \n1997 \n\n1997\u2013 \n2007 \n\n1985\u2013 \n1997 \n\n1997\u2013 \n2007 \n\n-3.6 \n\n-2.2 \n\n-0.6 \n\n-1.2 \n\n-2.0 \n\n2.5 \n\n3.8 \n\n4.6 \n\n3.5 \n\n3.6 \n\n-2.8 \n\n-1.6 \n\n0.5 \n\n0 \n\n-0.6 \n\n2.5 \n\n3.8 \n\n4.6 \n\n3.5 \n\n3.6 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.6 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.4 \n\nNotes:  \n* Statistically insignificant at 95% confidence level. \n**Value added is deflated by corporate goods price index of 2000 base (average index for domestic corporate goods, \nexports and imports) for manufacturing industry products. \n\nSource: Government of Japan, Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Census of Manufacturers (available: \nhttp://www.meti.go.jp/statistics/tyo/kougyo/archives/index.html [accessed 19 November 2009])., \n\nTo  examine  the  effects  of  excess  capacity  and  excess  employment,  TFP  in  the  general \nmachinery,  electrical  machinery, \ntransportation  equipment,  and  precision  machinery \nindustries  was  calculated  for  four  categories  according  to  number  of  employees:  30\u201399, \n100\u2013299, 300\u2013999, and more than 999. This paper adopts the growth accounting approach \nbased on two-input frameworks, taking single deflated value added as output, and labor and \ncapital  as  inputs.  The  Translog  index  of  TFP  growth  is  arrived  at  by  using  the  following \nequation: \n\n\u0394lnTFP(t)= \u0394lnY(t)\uff0d[ \n \n \n\nSL(t)+SL(t\uff0d1)           \n\n     SK(t)+SK(t\uff0d1) \n\n\u00d7\u0394lnL(t)]\uff0d[ \n\n                    \u00d7\u0394lnK(t)]  (1) \n\n2                    \n\n                  2 \n\nIn the above equation, Y denotes value added, L denotes labor, and K denotes capital. \u0394ln \nY(t) = ln Y(t) \u2013 ln Y(t-1). In the same way, \u0394ln L(t), and \u0394ln K(t) are defined. SL is the income \nshare of labor, and SK is the income share of capital. SL and SK add up to one. Using the \nabove equation, the growth rates of TFP are computed for each year.  \n\nThe basic source of data used for the productivity estimates is the Census of Manufacturers. \nTo  make  price  corrections  on  the  reported  data  on  value  added,  suitable  deflators  were \nselected  from  the  corporate  goods  price  index.  Capital  input  series  were  created,  allotting \ndata from the Annual Report on Gross Capital Stock of Private Enterprises (Government of \nJapan, Cabinet Office 2009) into four size groups. The estimates are shown in Figures 7a\u2013\n7d.  TFP  growth  rates  express  different  trends,  depending  on  employment  size  in  the \ntransportation equipment and precision machinery industries.  \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nFigure 7a: Trends of TFP Growth in the General Machinery Industry \n\nFigure 7b: Trends of TFP Growth in the Electrical Machinery Industry \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nFigure 7c: Trends of TFP Growth in the Transportation Equipment Industry \n\nFigure 7d: Trends of TFP Growth in the Precision Machinery Industry \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: The moving average for three years is used. \n\nSource: Author. \n\nTrends  of  excess  debt  and  excess  capacity  may  affect  TFP  growth  rates  in  the  four \nindustries.  A  multiple  regression  analysis  was  used  to  study  these  effects  on  TFP  growth \nrates. The analysis was based on pooled cross-section and time-series data. The regression \nequation is specified as:  \n\nTFPGit = \u03b1+\u03b21ESTit +\u03b22 RED+\u03b23URit + u \n\n(2) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nIn this equation, TFPGit is the growth rate of TFP in industry i in year t; ESTit is the rate of \nchange in the number of establishments in industry i in year t; RED is the rate of change in \nthe  interest-bearing  debt  redemption  period  in  industry  i  in  year  t;  and  UR  it  is  the  rate  of \nchange in the utilization rates of capacity in industry i in year t. The regression equation is \nestimated by the fixed-effects model with the year dummy (to identify a dramatic change in a \nspecific year) and without it. \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s  Database  of  Financial  Statements  Statistics  of  Corporations  by \nIndustry  categorizes  companies  into  four  groups  according  to  capital  size:  \u00a510\u201350  million, \n\u00a550\u2013100  million,  \u00a5100  million\u2013\u00a51  billion,  and  more  than  \u00a51  billion.  As  the  classification  of \nCensus  of  Manufacturers  depends  on  the  number  of  regular  employees,  conversion  is \nnecessary  to  use  the  data  from  both  sources.  This  paper  assumes  that  enterprises  with  a \ncapital of \u00a510\u201350 million employ 30\u201399 people, enterprises with a capital of \u00a550\u2013100 million \nemploy  100\u2013299  people,  enterprises  with  a  capital  of  \u00a5100  million\u2013\u00a51  billion  employ  300\u2013\n999  people,  and  enterprises  with  a  capital  of  more  than  \u00a51  billion  employ  more  than  999 \npeople.  The  Establishment  and  Enterprise  Census  of  Japan  has  created  a  table \ndifferentiating enterprises by industry, number of regular employees, and amount of capital. \nTable  2  shows  the  percentage  of  enterprises  that  meet  the  above-mentioned  capital  size \nconditions  for  each  employment  size  category.  Although  enterprises  with  a  capital  of  \u00a550\u2013\n100 million and \u00a5100 million\u2013\u00a51 billion constitute a relatively small share of those employing \n100\u2013299 and 300\u2013999 employees, respectively, enterprises with a capital of \u00a510\u201350 million \nand  more  than  \u00a51  billion  account  for  more  than  70%  of  enterprises  employing  30\u201399  and \n1,000 or more employees, respectively. \n\nTable 2: Percentage of Enterprises That Meet Both Conditions on Employment Size \nand Capital Size in Total Number of Enterprises in 1999 \n(%) \n\nGeneral \nMachinery \n75.5 \n31.2 \n38.2 \n86.8 \n\nNumber of Regular \nEmployees \n30\u201399 \n100\u2013299 \n300\u2013999 \n1,000 or more \n\nElectrical \nMachinery \n70.1 \n24.6 \n45.3 \n76.7 \nNote: The assumption of conversion is based on the following:  \nEnterprises with capital of \u00a510\u201350 million employ 30\u201399 people. \nEnterprises with capital of \u00a550\u2013100 million employ 100\u2013299 people. \nEnterprises with capital of \u00a5100 million\u2013\u00a51, billion employ 299\u2013999 people. \nEnterprises with capital of more than \u00a51 billion employ more than 999 people. \n\nTransportation \nEquipment \n75.4 \n28.3 \n50.2 \n82.9 \n\nPrecision \nMachinery \n75.9 \n32.6 \n40.8 \n73.5 \n\nSource: Government of Japan, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 1999 Establishment and Enterprise \nCensus (available: http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/ListE.do?bid=000000290031&cycode=0 [accessed 19 \nNovember 2009]). \n\nWhile  the  TFP  estimates  were  based  on  the  assumption  of  full  utilization  of  capacity,  the \nTFP  growth  rates  might  depend  on  underutilization  of  capacity  due  to  the  recession.  This \nstudy estimates utilization rates on the basis of minimum capital output ratio (Sastry 1984). \nCapital output ratios are calculated. A benchmark year is then selected on the basis of the \nobserved  lowest  capital  output  ratio.  It  is  considered  as  capacity  output.  The  estimate  of \ncapacity  is obtained  by  dividing  real  capital  stock  by  the  minimum  capital  output ratio.  The \nutilization rate is given by actual output as a proportion of the estimated capacity. \n\n \n\n13 \n\n\f \n\nUchikawa \n\nADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\nThus, \n\nU = \n\n\u30fb100 \n\nO \n \nC \n\nC \n\nC = \n\n     \u30fb100 \n\n \n(C/O)min \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere U is capacity utilization, O is gross value added, and C is the estimated capacity. This \nestimation  is  crude  but  there  are  no  better  estimates  of  capacity  utilization  (Goldar  and \nKumari 2003). \n\nThe  regression  results  presented  in  Table  3  show  a  significant  and  negative  correlation \nbetween TFP growth rates and the rate of change in the number of enterprises in both LEs \nand  SMEs.  It  suggests  that  the  decrease  in  the  number  of  establishments  might  improve \nTFP  growth  rates.  It  can  be  interpreted  that  the  exit  of  inefficient  SMEs  might  have  raised \nTFP  growth  rates.  A  significant  and  positive  correlation  between  TFP  growth  rates  and \ncapacity utilization can be seen in both LEs and SMEs. Utilization rates might have affected \nTFP  growth  rates.  A  correlation  between  TFP  growth  rates  and  a  change  in  the  interest-\nbearing debt redemption period was not observed.

LEs  reduced  the  number  of  suppliers  and  components  they  used. \nWhile efficient SMEs selected by LEs were able to expand their business, inefficient SMEs \nlost  customers.  Excess  debt  forced  many  SMEs  to  exit  the  market.  The  exit  of  inefficient \nSMEs reduced excess employment and excess capacity and might have raised TFP growth \nrates.  On  the  other  hand,  efficient  SMEs  improved  their  competitiveness  through \ninvestments  in  machinery  and  improvement  of  production  methods.  It  is  expected  that  if \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nworldwide recession permanently shrinks demand in the four industries, more SMEs will be \nforced into closing down. \n\n4.  REGIONAL VARIATION OF INDUSTRIAL CLUSTERS \n\nSME  policies  need  to  be  reviewed  from  both  the  industrial  policy  and  regional  policy \nstandpoints for three reasons. First, when an assembly factory is closed down, although the \nimpact  on  the  industry  as  a  whole  is  limited,  the  impact  on  the  region  is  huge.  As  many \nSMEs  that  had  been  supplying  the  closed  factories  lose  customers,  the  industrial  cluster \nwhere the closed factories are located is affected. Second, the leading industry in a cluster \nmay  change.  When  a  leading  industry  starts  to  decline,  municipal  governments  must \npromote  other  industries.  Third,  exchange  and  tie\u2013ups  among  SMEs  in  different  industries \nhelp to develop the local economy. In fact, the focus of SME policy has shifted from industry \nto  cluster.  The  collaboration  between  SMEs  in  different  industries  was  emphasized  in  the \n1980s. \n\nIndustrial  clusters  can  be  categorized  into  four  types  according  to  how  they  were  formed \nhistorically  and  according  to  their  characteristics:  (i)  company  town  clusters,  (ii)  production \nregion  clusters,  (iii)  mixed  urban  clusters,  and  (iv)  mixed  invitation  clusters  (SMEA  2006). \nThe advantages of the business environment differ according to the type of cluster and have \nchanged in the process of industrialization. \n\nCompany town clusters are formed by the agglomeration of numerous subcontractor groups \naround  the  assembly  factory  of  a  particular  LE.  Typical  examples  are  the  region  around \nToyota  City,  which  has  Toyota  Motor  Corporation  at  its  heart,  and  Hitachi  City,  which  has \nHitachi at its heart. Cluster regions have developed as a result of enterprises cutting the cost \nof expensive tasks such as production management and the acquisition of new customers, \nand their move to specialize in certain production processes. SMEs benefit from being within \nthe same business groups as the LEs. The success of Toyota Motor Corporation raised the \nnumber of employees living in Toyota City, as well as the value added (at 2000 prices) by \n1.5% and 0.6% between 1997 and 2007, respectively (Table 4). On the other hand, although \nthe number of employees in Hitachi City was more than 40,000 before 1994, it came down to \n25,000 in 2005. In the 1990s, Hitachi shifted the manufacturing base of its home appliances \nabroad.  As  a  result,  the  number  of  employees  at  its  major  subcontractors  was  reduced  to \nhalf the size it was in the 1970s (Japan Small Business Research Institute 2003). As clusters \nare  affected  by  the  difficulties  experienced  by  LEs,  SMEs  are  forced  to  diversify  their \nbusinesses.  The  traditional  business  model  of  being  dependent  on  certain  LEs  and  doing \nbusiness within the cluster is not functioning as well as it used to. Within the clusters, SMEs \nare discovering new clients and trying to diversify outlets. \n\n \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nTable 4: Trends of Manufacturing Establishments Employing More Than Three \nEmployees in Four Types of Clusters \n(%) \n\nCategories of \nClusters \nName of Cities \n\nCompany Town \n\nProduction Region \n\nToyota \nHitachi \n\nTsubame \nSabae \n\nMixed Urban \nSumida \nOta \nHigashi-Osaka \nMixed Invitation \n\nKitakami \nKofu \n\nNumber of \nEstablishments \n1997\u2013\n1985\u2013\n2007 \n1997 \n\nNumber of \nEmployees \n\nValue Added \n\n1985\u2013\n1997 \n\n1997\u2013\n2007 \n\n1985\u2013\n1997 \n\n1997\u2013\n2007 \n\n-0.5* \n-2.5 \n\n-1.6 \n-0.7* \n\n-3.7 \n-3.5 \n-1.5 \n\n1.5 \n-3.8 \n\n-0.2* \n-3.6 \n\n-3.7 \n-5.0  \n\n-6.2 \n-4.2* \n-3.7 \n\n-2.1 \n-4.8* \n\n0.4* \n-1.1 \n\n-1.3 \n-1.0  \n\n-3.5 \n-4.1 \n-1.4 \n\n2.9 \n-1.7 \n\n1.5 \n-3.5 \n\n-3.1 \n-3.4 \n\n-5.3 \n-5.9 \n-3.4 \n\n-1.1 \n-2.7*  \n\n-0.6* \n2.2* \n\n2.3 \n1.7 \n\n0.4* \n-0.5* \n1.1* \n\n4.6 \n2.6 \n\n0.6 \n0.3* \n\n0.2* \n-3.5 \n\n4.9* \n-4.6 \n-2.7 \n\n2.9* \n-0.4* \n\nNote: * Statistically insignificant at 95% confidence level. \n\nSource: Government of Japan, Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Census of Manufacturers (available: \nhttp://www.meti.go.jp/statistics/tyo/kougyo/archives/index.html [accessed 1 June 2009]). \n\nProduction region clusters are formed by enterprises belonging to a specific industry, such \nas consumer goods, concentrating in a particular region that has grown through the sharing \nof raw materials and technologies that accumulated in that region. Typical examples are the \nTsubame-Sanjyo region in Niigata Prefecture, where cutlery and blade manufacturers have \nclustered,  and  Sabae  City  in  Fukui  Prefecture,  where  eyeglass  frame  manufacturers  have \nclustered.  SMEs  in  these  regions  receive  orders  through  a  joint  order-taking  system  and \nhave established a system of division of labor within the cluster to manufacture cheap, high-\nquality,  mass-produced  goods.  However,  tough  competition  with  cheap  goods  produced  in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China has shrunk their domestic and export markets. Their system \nof  mass  production,  which  has  been  a  source  of  competitive  advantage,  appears  to  be \nperforming  less  well  today.  Heavy  dependence  on  certain  industries  and  the  highly \nsegmented and specialized production processes prevent the clusters from adjusting to the \nnew  business  environment  (SMEA  2006).  The  number  of  establishments  and  employees \nhas  clearly  declined  since  1997  in  Tsubame  and  Sabae.  In  Sabae  City,  some  SMEs  are \ntrying  to  enter  the  precision  machinery  and  medical  equipment  industries  utilizing \naccumulated skills. \n\nMixed  urban  clusters  have  formed  in  urban  areas.  There  are  many  such  clusters  in  the \nmachinery and metalworking industries, and there often occurs a division of labor between \nenterprises  in  the  same  cluster,  as  well  as  business  relations  that  cut  across  traditional \nindustry groupings. Typical examples include Sumida City and Ota City in Tokyo Prefecture \nand Higashi-Osaka City in Osaka Prefecture. The number of establishments in Sumida and \nOta  decreased  sharply  even  before  the  boom  period  began  in  1985.  Rising  land  prices \nencouraged  the  diversion  of  factory  sites  to  housing  areas.  Recession  accelerated  the \ndownward trends in the three cities between 1997 and 2007. But, some SMEs are growing. \nAs  it  is  difficult  to  establish  systems  of  mass  production  in  urban  areas,  where  the  cost  of \nland  and  labor  is  relatively  high,  clusters  located  in  urban  areas  specialize  in  high  value-\nadded products. Production functions in such clusters are based on flexible divisions of labor \nas  a  result  of  the  clustering  of  diverse  industries  and  technologies.  Consequently,  the \nclusters  have  been  able  to  respond  to  changes  in  the  industrial  structure  during  the  long-\n\n \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nterm  recession.  It  is  noteworthy  that  SMEs  in  these  clusters  have  the  production  and \nprocessing abilities to deal with product development and trials. \n\nMixed  invitation  clusters  are  formed  as  a  result  of  local  government  efforts  to  attract \nenterprises  and  the  implementation  of  industrial  relocation  plans.  During  the  1970s,  the \ngovernment  regulated  the  size  of  factory  sites  in  metropolitan  areas  and  subsidized  the \ntransfer  of  factory  sites  to  rural  areas.  As  many  of  the  invited  SMEs  belong  to  industry \ngroups outside the cluster, collaboration within the clusters has not been very active. Typical \nexamples  are  the  Kitakamigawa  basin  region  in  Iwate  Prefecture  and  Kofu  City  in \nYamanashi  Prefecture.  The  clusters  have  developed  because  of  the  increasing  number  of \nlabor-intensive  plants,  enticed  by  large  orders  from  enterprises  in  that  region  and  the \ncomparatively cheap labor. Some SMEs in mixed urban clusters set up secondary factories \nin mixed invitation clusters due to regulations pertaining to factory sites. Various SMEs have \nbeen added to these clusters such that they have become more complex and are no longer \ndependent on a specific industry. However, some factories have withdrawn from the clusters \ndue  to  the  availability  of  cheaper  labor  in  other  Asian  countries.  The  number  of \nestablishments decreased in Kofu City and Kitakawa City during the 1990s. This shows that \nwith globalization, cheap labor is fading as a competitive edge for clusters in Japan. \n\nThe above analysis suggests that diversification and collaboration that cut across traditional \nindustry groupings are key points to activating the local economy. Although the decline in the \nnumber  of  SMEs  has  been  a  common  phenomenon  in  the  four  types  of  clusters,  some \nclusters  are  still  creating  new  businesses  by  taking  advantage  of  more  flexible  divisions  of \nlabor. \n\n5.  SME POLICIES IN JAPAN \n\nSME policies in Japan have been modified to adjust to changing economic conditions. SME \npolicies during the 1980s were noteworthy for three reasons. First, they tried to encourage \nR&D in SMEs, rather than the diffusion of existing technology. SMEs could get low-interest \nloans  from  government  financial  institutions  after  local  governments  approved  their \ntechnology  development  plans \nin  high-technology  areas  such  as  electronics  and \nbiotechnology.  Subsidies  and  tax  concessions  were  provided  for  R&D  activities  conducted \nby SMEs. Second, the government recognized the positive effects of technology exchange \nand  tie-ups  among  SMEs  in  different  industries  and  began  to  encourage  these  activities. \nDuring the recession in the 1970s, SMEs in the machinery industry collaborated to produce \nhigh value-added products. The collaboration was effective for the joint development of unit \ncomponents. Thus, in 1981, the government started technology exchange plaza projects to \nfacilitate  exchange  and  tie-ups  among  SMEs  in  each  prefecture.  In  1988,  the  government \nbegan  to  subsidize  and  give  tax  concessions  to  new  technology  developments  by \ncooperative  associations  among  SMEs  in  different  industries.  Third,  the  government \nencouraged  new  project  ideas.  Prefectural  and  municipal  governments  and  the  private \nsector got together and set up business incubators to reactivate local economies negatively \naffected  by  the  recession.  Subsidies  from  the  government  and  low-interest  loans  from \ngovernment  financial  institutions  were  provided  to  incubator  projects.  However,  the \noccupation  ratio  of  incubator  projects  was low due  to  the high  rents. Such  high  rents  were \ncharged  because  prefectural  and  municipal  governments  gave  priority  to  the  acquisition  of \nsubsidies from the central government over careful examination of the feasibility of projects \n(Kurose 2006). \n\nThe  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Basic  Law  was  revised  fundamentally  in  1999.  It  was \nconsidered the backbone of SME policies. Its policy concept was to rectify the gap between \nSMEs  and  LEs  in  terms  of  labor  productivity  by  upgrading  the  structure  of  SMEs  and \nimproving  the  conditions  of  trade.  The  government  also  recognized  that  SMEs  could  not \nintroduce  modern  technology  given  their  small  size  and  the  excessive  competition  among \n\n \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nthem.  The  policy  concept  had  already  been  changed  from  modernization  to  business \nconversion in the 1980s. Moreover, business innovations and start-ups were encouraged in \nthe 1990s. \n\nAmendment of the law confirmed the change in SME polices. The new Small and Medium \nEnterprise  Basic  Law  was  based  on  a  new  philosophy  of  promoting  diverse  and  vigorous \ngrowth  and  the  development  of  independent  SMEs  rather  than  on  rectifying  gaps.  It  has \nthree  key  goals:  (i)  promoting  business  innovation  and  new  business  start-ups,  (ii) \nstrengthening  the  management  base  of  SMEs,  and  (iii)  facilitating  adaptation  to  economic \nand social changes. Business innovation is a broad concept and covers new products that \nSMEs  are  trying  to  develop  and  produce.  The  new  law  does  not  have  any  intent  to  direct \nSMEs in specific areas, as was the case with the old law. SME policies became competition-\noriented. Moreover, the new law defined the responsibility of municipal governments. Before \nthe  amendment,  only  the  central  and  prefectural  governments  were  involved  in  SME \npromotion. \n\nHowever, SME policies cannot stop the long trend of SME decline during the recession. The \nexit of many SMEs has significantly affected local economies. Some municipal governments \nhave  implemented  local  ordinances  promoting  SME  development  to  activate  their  local \neconomies.  Municipal  governments  can  play  an  important  role  in  collecting  information, \ninteracting with SMEs, and organizing exchange among SMEs. \n\nIn 1979, Sumida City became the first municipality in which the government implemented a \nlocal  ordinance  on  SME  development.  The  SME  promotion  policies  of  Sumida  City  are \nunique  for  three  reasons.  First,  the  government  set  up  a  database  containing  pertinent \ninformation  about  SMEs  in  the  city.  In  1977  and  1978,  180  employees  of  the  city  office \nvisited  all  9,313  registered  establishments  to  conduct  a  survey.  They  also  carried  out  a \nhearing with personnel of the SMEs. The hearing was a good opportunity for employees of \nthe city office to understand the problems that SMEs were facing. The experience was useful \nin the development of a master plan for SME promotion in 1986, 1989, and 2003. Second, \nSME  owners  were  given  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  policymaking.  In  1980,  the \ngovernment  set  up  the  Industrial  Promotion  Committee,  which  consisted  of  SME  owners, \nexperts,  and  government  employees.  In  consultation  with  the  said  committee,  the \ngovernment runs an SME center that has technical advisers and is equipped with expensive \nmachine  tools  and  instruments  that  SMEs  in  the  city  can  use.  Third,  SME  promotion  was \nstrengthened  by \nIndustrial  Promotion  Committee \nrecommended  the  setting  up  of  small  museums  to  present  the  industry  and  culture  of \nSumida  City  to  local  and  foreign  tourists,  as  well  as  small  shops  on  the  premises  of  the \nfactories to sell products made by Sumida City SMEs. SME promotion thus became a part of \npolicies to activate the local economy. \n\ntourism.  The \n\nlinking \n\nlocal \n\nto \n\nit \n\nThe  direction  of  SME  policies  can  be  appreciated  on  three  fronts.  First,  private  sector \ninitiatives  are  being  facilitated.  The  government  should  not  force  business  models  like \nmodernization  policies.  SMEs  have  the  ability  to  find  new  business  areas.  Second,  R&D \nactivities  are  being  encouraged.  SMEs  have  a  competitive  advantage  in  R&D  activities \nbecause  they  can  specialize  in  niche  areas.  Third,  municipal  governments  can  play  an \nimportant  role  in  promoting  SMEs.  Some  municipal  governments  have  followed  the  best \npractice of Sumida City. Based on the experience of Sumida City, they have learned to give \npriority to SME promotion, tap local resources, and take into consideration the character of \nthe local economy when making their plans. They likewise have realized the importance of \nthe interaction between the local governments and SMEs in making their plans work. \n\n6.  RESULTS OF FIELD SURVEY \n\nTo investigate diversification by SMEs and its policy implications, a survey was conducted in \nOta City of Tokyo Prefecture and in Southern Kyoto Prefecture in May, June, and November \n\n \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nof  2004.  The  target  SMEs  were  selected  mainly  from  the  award-winning  SMEs  in  Ota  City \nand  Kyoto  Prefecture.  Most  of  them  were  above-average  SMEs  in  terms  of  standard \nqualities and had unique traits. Table 5 shows the characteristics of each company. Those in \nOta City had flexible divisions of labor as mentioned earlier. Although the government of Ota \nCity enacted local ordinances that affect SME development and has been actively promoting \nSME development, the number of SMEs has declined since the 1980s. After the factory sites \nin metropolitan areas were regulated, some SMEs established their secondary factories for \nmass production in rural areas. As Southern Kyoto is close to Osaka, subcontracting SMEs \nhave developed in the area. SMEs in Japan are becoming less competitive in labor-intensive \nprocesses as a result of competition from neighboring Asian countries. SMEs that are doing \nwell in urban areas might have lessons to offer. Five points were found out from the survey.  \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\n5.a: Ota City \n\nProducts \n\nNumber of \nRegular \nEmployees \n\nMain \nCustomers \n\nLocation \n\nParticipation in \nCooperation \n\nRelation to \nLEs \n\nDiversification \n\nOverseas \nAffiliates \n\nSecondary \nFactories \nin Japan \n\nOriginality \n\nTable 5: Characteristics of Surveyed SMEs \n\nPlating \n\n80 \n\nSupplier \n\nMolding \n\nOta City  \n\nAutomobile, \nElectrical \nequipment \n\nIndustrial estate \n(modernization \nscheme) \n\nElectronics, \nSemiconductor \n\nOwn factory \n\nCooperative \nassociation (Pollution \ncontrol, R&D) \nMember of Tokyo \nChamber of Commerce \nand Industry \n\nPrecise process \n\n100 \n\nSupplier \n\nRural area \n\nSecondary and \nTertiary \nfactories \n\nPRC \n(planning) \n\n  \n\n9 \n\n5 \n\n8 \n\n18 \n\n45 \n\n25 \n\nPower plant \n\nMachine \nmanufacturers \n\nOne floor of \nprivate \nresidential \napartment \nIndustrial \napartment in \nindustrial estate \nIndustrial \napartment \nowned by Ota \nCity \n\nIndustrial \napartment \nowned by Ota \nCity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nOwn factory \n\nElectrical \nequipment \nSemiconductor  Own factory \nElectrical \nequipment \n(R&D and \nsales) \n\nIndustrial \napartment \nowned by Ota \nCity \n\nElectrical \nequipment \n\nDie \n\nMachine (robot, \netc.) \nmanufacturing \nincluding R&D \nand software \n\nMetal process \n\nMetal process \n\nElectrical \nequipment \n\n \n\nSubcontractor\n\n \n\nProcess of \ntrial \nSupplier \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n  \n\nDevelopment of \nnew products \n\nOriginal \nproducts \n\n20 \n\nMetal process \n\nSemiconductor \n\nSubcontractor\n\n12 \n\nAutomobile \n\nJoint R&D with SME \nand universities \n\nR&D on \nconsignment \n\nDevelopment of \nnew products \n\nRural area \n\nOriginal \nproducts \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\nProducts \n\nNumber of \nRegular \nEmployees \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nLocation \n\nParticipation in \nCooperation \n\nRelation to \nLEs \n\nDiversification \n\nOverseas \nAffiliates \n\nSecondary \nFactories \nin Japan \n\nOriginality \n\nCooperative \nassociation \n\nSubcontractor\n\n \n\nAutomobile \n\nOwn factory \n\nElectrical \nequipment \n\nJoint R&D with \nuniversities \n\nMain \nCustomers \n\nMachine tool,  \nSemiconductor \nTransportation \nequipment \n\n \nElectrical \nequipment \n\nElectrical \nequipment \n\nOwn factory \n\nOwn factory \n\nOwn factory \n\nIndustrial \napartment \nowned by Ota \nCity \nOwn factory \n\nOwn factory \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n46 \n\n92 \n\n120 \n\n12 \n\n11 \n\n37 \n\nMetal process \n\n8 \n\nSemiconductor \n\nSubcontractor Heat treatment \n\nRural area \n\nDevelopment of \nnew products \n\nProduction of \nmachinery \n\nThailand  \n\nThailand \nPhilippines \nPRC \n\nOriginal \nproducts \n\nOriginal \nproducts \n\nRural area \n\nSupplier \n\nSupplier \n\nSupplier \n\n \n\nSupplier \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOwn factory \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nR&D on \nconsignment \n\nEngineering \nproduction of \ntrial \n\nNumber of \nRegular \nEmployees \n\nMain \nCustomers \n\nSemiconductor, \nElectrical \nequipment \n\nLocation \n\nParticipation in \nCooperation \n\nRelation to \nLEs \n\nDiversification \n\nOverseas \nAffiliates \n\nSecondary \nFactories in \nJapan \n\nOriginality \n\n140 \n\nOwn factory \n\nExchange association \namong SMEs \n\nProduction of \nmachinery \n\n \n\nRural area \n\n \n\nSupplier \n\nSupplier \n\nSupplier \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPRC \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOriginal \nproducts \n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nOwn factory \n\n \n\nOwn factory \n\nExchange association \namong SMEs \n\nElectrical \nequipment \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n42 \n\nSource: Author. \n\n21 \n\nPrecise process \n\nMetal process \n\nMachine \nmanufacturing \n\nPrecise die and \npress \n\nPlating \nMachine \nmanufacturing \n\nMachine \nmanufacturing \n\n5.b: Kyoto \n\nProducts \n\nPrecise die and \npress \n\nMachine tool \nManufacturing \nPrecise plastic \nmould \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nFirst,  most  of  the  20  SMEs  had  outstanding  technology  and  special  skills,  and  had \nestablished their brands among their clients. With the high price of land and high wages that \nput SMEs in urban areas at a disadvantage, they must have unique sales points. Five SMEs \ndeveloped  original  products  that  other  companies,  including  LEs,  were  not  producing  and \nwere selling them. Other SMEs also had special skills that other companies could not imitate \neasily. For example, although a metal processing SME has higher margin rates than other \ncompanies because it can only process difficult-to-cut materials in the short term, it can get \norders regularly. Originality, unique technology, and skill are more important than production \ncosts for SMEs in urban areas. \n\nSecond, three of the 20 SMEs were R&D-oriented business ventures that concentrate on the \ndesign  and  development  of  new  products.  The  first  SME  produced  equipment  for \nmechanization. It had obtained patents from Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, and United \nStates. The managing director pointed out the possibility of a development-oriented venture \nbusiness. As LEs reduced the number of engineers on staff during the recession, they must \nrely on outsourcing to develop peripheral equipment. The second SME also mentioned the \nsame  point.  Because  small  venture  companies  look  for  niche  markets,  they  have  many \nopportunities  to  develop  various  products.  Although  experience  is  necessary  for  the \ndevelopment of new products, engineers in LEs do not often get many chances to expand \ntheir  expertise  because  they  concentrate  only  on  major  projects.  Meanwhile,  SMEs \nconcentrate on product design, development, and sales, but outsource manufacturing. The \nthird  SME  is  shifting  to  become  an  engineering  company  so  it  is  likely  that  it  will  stop \nmanufacturing in the future. \n\nThird,  four  of  the  17  SMEs  in  Ota  City  were  located  in  industrial  apartments.  They  had \nfactories  on  the  lower  floors  and  residences  on  the  higher  floors.  It  is  noteworthy  that  two \nR&D-oriented business ventures were in such industrial apartments. It can be surmised that \nindustrial apartments helped some new industry-oriented SMEs to enter the market. \n\nFourth, five of the 20 SMEs had secondary factories in rural areas. Secondary factories take \ncharge of mass production, while head factories concentrate on small-amount production of \nmany varieties of products related to R&D and trials. \n\nFifth, four of the 20 SMEs were subcontractors. Among them, three SMEs had transactions \nwith  other  companies  while  only  one  completely  depended  on  a  parent  company.  That \ncompany  is  eventually  going  to  move  its  operations  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  to \nfollow  its  parent  company.  This  shows  that  dependence  on  a  parent  company  makes  the \nmanagement base of an SME fairly weak. \n\nThe above  analysis suggests three ways through which SMEs can survive in urban areas. \nFirst, SMEs that have outstanding technology and special skills can survive. Although SMEs \nin urban areas do not have an advantage in mass production, they have the edge in small-\namount  production  of  many  varieties  of  products.  As  LEs  in  metropolitan  areas  actively \nconduct  R&D,  SMEs  have  a  chance  to  be  involved  in  trials  and  R&D-related  business. \nSecond,  R&D-oriented  business  ventures  have  the  opportunity  to  grow  in  niche  areas.  As \nmanufacturing is outsourced, efficient links between the R&D efforts of SMEs in urban areas \nand manufacturing spots is important. Third, setting up industrial apartments is an effective \nway  to  relax  constraints  for  new  industry-oriented  SMEs  looking  to  set  up  factory  sites  in \nurban areas. \n\n7.  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nDuring the long-term recession, the streamlining of procurement by LEs changed the multi-\ntier  subcontracting  system.  LEs  reduced  the  number  of  suppliers  and  components  they \nused. While efficient SMEs selected by LEs  were able to expand their business, inefficient \nSMEs  lost  customers.  The  regression  results  show  a  significant  and  negative  correlation \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nbetween  TFP  growth  rates  and  the  rate  of  change  in  the  number  of  enterprises  in  four \nindustries: general machinery, electrical machinery, transportation equipment, and precision \nmachinery.  This  suggests  that  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  establishments  might  improve \nTFP  growth  rates.  It  can  be  interpreted  that  the  exit  of  inefficient  SMEs  might  have  raised \nTFP growth rates. Only efficient SMEs that meet the demands of cost, quality, and delivery \nfrom LEs will survive during the present recession. It is expected that if worldwide recession \npermanently  shrinks  demand  in  the  four  industries,  more  SMEs  will  be  forced  into  closing \ndown. \n\nAlthough the decline in the number of SMEs has been a common phenomenon in the four \ntypes  of  clusters,  some  SMEs  have  still  been  able  to  create  new  businesses  by  taking \nadvantage  of  more  flexible  divisions  of  labor.  The  traditional  business  model  of  being \ndependent on certain LEs and doing business within the cluster is not functioning as well as \nit  used  to.  Heavy  dependence  on  certain  industries  and  highly  segmented  and  specialized \nproduction processes prevent the clusters from adjusting to the new business environment. \nSME  policies  must  encourage  diversification  and  collaboration  that  cut  across  traditional \nindustry groupings to form flexible divisions of labor. \n\nSMEs  in  Japan  are  becoming  less  competitive  in  labor-intensive  processes,  as  a  result  of \nstiff competition from neighboring Asian countries. SMEs that are doing well in urban areas \nmight  have  some  lessons  to  offer.  Results  of  a  field  survey  suggest  three  ways  in  which \nSMEs can survive in urban areas. First, SMEs that have outstanding technology and special \nskills can survive. Although SMEs in urban areas do not have the edge in mass production, \nthey  do  have  an  advantage  in  small-amount  production  for  many  products.  Second,  R&D-\noriented  business  ventures  have  a  chance  to  grow  in  niche  areas.  As  manufacturing  is \noutsourced,  efficient  links  between  the  R&D  efforts  of  SMEs  in  urban  areas  and \nmanufacturing spots is important. Third, setting up industrial apartments is an effective way \nto relax constraints for new industry-oriented SMEs looking to set up factory sites in urban \nareas. \n\nThe following policy recommendations are based on this analysis: \n\n\u2022  Unfair  trade  should  be  regulated  by  law.  In  some  cases,  parent  companies  have \nmade unfair demands of subcontractors, such as demanding that they reduce the \nprices  of  components  after  an  agreement  had  been  signed.  In  other  cases, \ncontracts have been abruptly terminated. Such unfair treatment might affect SMEs. \n\n\u2022  Although  the  financing  of  working  capital  for  SMEs  has  been  secured,  careful \nthe  recession \nexamination  of  additional \ndecreased  ordinary  profits,  banks  increased  long-term  loans  to  SMEs  between \n1991  and  1995  because  they  were  afraid  that  these  loans  would  become \nnonperforming assets. Additional loans to avoid financial crunch made excess debt \nin SMEs more serious. \n\nis  necessary.  Although \n\nfinancing \n\n\u2022  The  entry  of  SMEs  should  be  encouraged  by  providing  incentives  such  as \nsubsidies, low-interest loans, tax concessions, and incubator facilities as these can \ncontribute to employment creation and the opening of new industries. The costs of \nentering the market have risen due to technological development in the past years. \nAdvanced machinery is necessary to meet the increasing demands of customers. \nSMEs  cannot  maintain  their  businesses  without  advanced  technology  and \naccumulated skills. Entry into manufacturing, particularly by the young generation, \nis  thus  becoming  more  difficult  than  it  was  during  the  1960s.  On  the  other  hand, \nR&D-oriented business ventures have a chance to grow in niche areas. Such entry \nshould be supported by policies. \n\n\u2022  Municipal governments should play an active role in coordinating collaboration that \ncuts across traditional industry groupings. Based on the experience of Sumida City, \nmunicipal  governments  have  learned  to  give  priority  to  SME  promotion,  tap  local \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nresources,  and  take  into  consideration  the  character  of  the  local  economy  when \nmaking  their  plans.  They  likewise  realized  the  importance  of  the  interaction \nbetween local governments and SMEs to make their plans work. \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 169 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nUchikawa \n\nAsanuma, B. 1989.
