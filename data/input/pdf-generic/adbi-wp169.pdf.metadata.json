INTRODUCTION\n \nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) have long played an important role in supplying parts \nand components to large enterprises (LEs) in Japan through subcontracting. However, the \nrelationship between LEs and SMEs has changed under the long-term recession since 1991. \nThe  streamlining  of  procurement  by  the  LEs  led  to  the  selection  of  only  the  efficient \nsubcontractors. While efficient SMEs can get more orders and can invest to improve their \ncapacity, the inefficient ones lost business opportunities. During the long-term recession, the \nso-called \u201cthree excesses\u201d\u2014excess debt, excess capacity, and excess employment\u2014had \nput a burden on all enterprises including SMEs. This paper examines the trends of the three \nexcesses in SMEs. \nSME  policies  need  to  be  reviewed  both  from  the  industrial  policy  and  regional  policy \nstandpoints. Industrial clusters can also be grouped into four types according to how they \nwere formed historically and according to their characteristics. This paper investigates the \ntrends  and  characteristics  of  four  types  of  industrial  clusters.  Although  the  number  of \nestablishments has declined in all types of industrial clusters, some clusters are trying to \nactivate local economy by diversifying their businesses and converting to high value-added \nareas. \nSME policies in Japan have been modified to adjust to changing economic situations. The \npolicy concept had already been changed from modernization to business conversion in the \n1980s. Moreover, business innovations and start-ups were encouraged in the 1990s. The \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Basic Law was revised fundamentally in 1999. The previous \nlaw defined companies with capital of less than 100 million yen (\u00a5) or employing less than \n301 employees as SMEs. The revised law raised the capital size of SMEs from \u00a5100 million \nto \u00a5300 million. This paper is based on the definition of the previous law. \nThe  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  come  up  with  policy  recommendations  to  support \nmanufacturing  SMEs  based  on  the  analysis  of  trends  among  SMEs.  These \nrecommendations are presented in the conclusion. \n2.  THE FUTURE OF JAPANESE SMES \n2.1  Subcontracting \nIn Japan, a multi-tier subcontracting system based on specialization was established to help \ndevelop the supporting industry during the rapid economic growth period in the 1960s and \n1970s. The supporting industry is defined as the industry that supports assembly industries, \nsuch as electrical machinery and automobiles, by supplying parts and components, die, and \nmold. SMEs are main players in the supporting industry.1 As the technology available to \nassemblers improved, so did that of SMEs in the supporting industry. An efficient division of \nlabor  between  SMEs  and  LEs  has  been  established  in  the  electrical  machinery  and \nautomobile industries. Subcontracting has contributed to the improvement of production \nefficiency in the Japanese manufacturing sector. Urata and Kawai (2001) credited the growth \nof total factor productivity (TFP) in the Japanese manufacturing sector between 1972 and \n1986 to active patent introduction and active participation in subcontracting. Although the \nmulti-tier subcontracting system has been changing, the efficient division of labor between \nSMEs and LEs is still working. This system can be considered a factor in the improvement of \nthe  production  efficiency  and  competitiveness  of  Japanese  manufacturing.  Typical \nsubcontracting is observed in the electrical machinery and automobile industries. This paper \n                                                 \n1 SMEs in the supporting industry belong to various categories of industrial classification, such as \nchemicals, non-metallic mineral products, basic metals, and metal products. \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nfocuses  on  subcontracting  in  general  machinery,  electrical  machinery,  transportation \nequipment,  and  precision  machinery.  These  industries  accounted  for  46%  of  the  value \nadded of the manufacturing sector in 2007. \nIn  Japan,  major  electrical  machinery  and  automobile  companies  procure  parts  and \ncomponents from three sources. First, they produce parts and components in their own \nfactories using their own staff or resources. Second, they purchase parts and components \nfrom the market. The transactions with suppliers depend on market prices and are usually \nshort term in nature. Third, they purchase parts and components from subcontractors based \non  long-term  commitments.  Economic  theories  try  to  explain  why  subcontracting  is  an \nefficient method of procurement for assemblers. Kimura (2001) summarized the theoretical \nfoundation  of  subcontracting  in  terms  of  transaction  cost,  game  theory,  economics  of \ninformation, and network approaches, and pointed out that technological characteristics are \nthe key for an industry to develop a subcontracting system. LEs choose subcontracting when \nthe upstream production requires specialized technology. This argument is based on the \npremise that efficient and reliable SMEs are available in Japan. \nFigure 1 shows the typical four-tier structure of subcontracting. In the top tier are the LEs, \nwhich  include  not  only  assemblers  of  electrical  appliances  and  automobiles,  but  also \nmanufacturers of complete components. Some automobile component manufacturers are \nmultinational enterprises, and their capital size is larger than that of automobile assemblers.2 \nLarge electrical machinery companies supply auto components to automobile assemblers. \nTransactions  among  LEs  in  the  top  tier  are  not  subcontracting.  LEs  have  factories \nassembling products in different areas. Clusters of SMEs specializing in specific products \nhave been formed to supply the factories of the LEs. The rise and fall of these clusters \ndepend on the condition of the factories that function as the core of the clusters. \nFigure 1: Structure of Subcontracting \n                       \nF ir  st    Ti  e r \nL Es  \nSecondTier\nL a r g e  a  n d  M  e  d iu   m   \nT h i rd   T   ie  r \nSm   a ll      a nF d   M  e  d iu   m \nFourthTier\nT in  y   a n d   Sm   a ll    En  te  rp  r is e  s \n \nSource: Author. \nIn the second tier are the medium and large enterprises that assemble components and \nsupply them to LEs in the first tier. The enterprises in the second tier have three common \nabilities. First, they have specialized technology that others cannot imitate. Second, they can \nplay the role of coordinator of SMEs. The enterprises in the second tier procure parts from \nSMEs in the third tier and assemble them. As they can control the quality and delivery of \n                                                 \n2 The common stock of Denso (an automobile component manufacturer) was pegged at \u00a5187.4 \nmillion on 31 March 2007 while Suzuki\u2019s (an automobile assembler) was \u00a5120 million on the same \nday. \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \ncomponents  and,  therefore,  can  reduce  total  production  costs,  LEs  benefit  from  this \nrelationship by saving on overhead costs associated with controlling and coordinating SMEs. \nIn  the  case  of  Toyota,  while  the  company  is  indirectly  linked  with  more  than  30,000 \nenterprises, it also has direct transactions with hundreds of enterprises. Third, they have \ndesign ability. It is common for LEs to give rough designs to the enterprises in the second \ntier, which then draw up the specifications. In many cases, enterprises in the first and \nsecond tiers co-develop components for new products (Yoshida 1997). \nMeanwhile, SMEs in the third tier specialize in specific processes and produce parts. They \nare also expected to meet demands on cost, quality, and delivery from their customers. Tiny \nand small enterprises in the fourth tier are mostly family owned and managed, and take \ncharge of relatively simple processes at low margins. Due to their size, the management \nbase of enterprises in the third and fourth tiers are generally weak. \nThere is a significant gap between wages in LEs in the first tier and those of SMEs in the \nthird and fourth tiers. In 2007, while the per capita annual value of total cash wages and \nsalaries was \u00a53 million in enterprises employing four to nine people, those of enterprises \nemploying  1,000  or  more  persons  was  \u00a56.7  million  (Government  of  Japan,  Ministry  of \nEconomy, Trade, and Industry 2009). LEs can save on labor costs by subcontracting. More \nimportant, however, is that subcontracting is dependent on specialization (e.g., in part and \ncomponent production) in the electrical machinery and automobile industries. \n2.2  Relation-Specific Skills \nSubcontracting  does  not  necessarily  entail  a  rigid  and  exclusive  contract.  Electrical \nmachinery and automobile companies produce many models and change models regularly. \nSpecifications for each part of the new model as well as the price thereof are determined \nduring the development period prior to the model change. Once a subcontractor receives an \norder for a part (when the commercial production of a new model is launched), the order is \nnormally renewed or continued. There is a tendency for LEs to assign the responsibility for \nsupplying a part for a specific model to a single subcontractor to avoid duplicate investment. \nBut,  when  the  life  of  a  given  model  comes  to  an  end,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  a \nsubcontractor that has been supplying a part for that model will receive an order for the \nsame kind of part for the new model. \nSubcontractors must meet the demands of a parent company at three critical points: (i) price \nreduction  by  some  targeted  percentage  within  a  certain  time  span,  reflecting  efforts  to \nreduce costs; (ii) high reliability in quality assurance; and (iii) high reliability in keeping up \nwith the delivery schedule. On the other hand, parent companies support improvements in \nproduction  efficiency  by  subcontractors  through  technical  assistance,  such  as  training \nsubcontractors\u2019  employees  and  dispatching  engineers  to  subcontractors\u2019  factories. \nMoreover, learning through repeated interactions with a particular parent company results in \nnew  skills  being  developed  in  addition  to  the  basic  technological  capability  that \nsubcontractors accumulate. Asanuma (1989) referred to this accumulated learning as a \nrelation-specific skill and noted that it usually leads to competitive spot bidding on the part of \nthe subcontractors if the transaction is repeated often enough over a certain period.3 \n2.3  Changes in the Subcontracting System \nJapan\u2019s subcontracting system has changed during the long-term recession that began in \n1991.  Japanese  automobile  companies,  including  major  complete  component \n                                                 \n3 Asanuma focused on the relations between typical LEs that manufacture the final products of the \nautomobile  and  electrical  machinery  industries  and  the  companies  that  supply  repeatedly \ntransacted parts. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nmanufacturers, have changed their procurement strategies in three ways and have reduced \ntransactions with subcontractors. \nFirst,  they  began  to  procure  components  from  subcontractors  under  different  parent \ncompanies. Cross-group transactions became common in the Japanese market. Moreover, \nautomobile companies gave up their strategy of producing all parts and components within \nthe same company groups. They sold their non-earning subcontracting companies to other \ncompanies and concentrated on their high-performing sections. \nSecond, automobile manufacturers reduced the number of components they use. During the \neconomic boom in the second half of the 1980s, they increased the number of models and \neven included different components within the same model to attract customers through \nproduct distinction. Naturally, this raised the number of man-hours on the assembly line and \nthe research and development (R&D) and production costs of components. During the \nrecession, however, manufacturers tried to use common components for different models to \nreduce the number of components. Moreover, some companies formed tie-ups with different \ncompanies  to  share  common  components.  As  the  reduction  of  items  encouraged  the \nstandardization  of  components,  lot  production  of  items  increased  and  component \nmanufacturers  started  to  benefit  from  economies  of  scale.  Meanwhile,  automobile \nassemblers  concentrated  on  efficient  component  manufacturers. 4   Hence,  inefficient \nmanufacturers began to lose clients. \nThird, large automobile and component manufacturers increased the share of parts and \ncomponents they produced in-house. They did this for several reasons. Reduced demand \nduring  the  long-term  recession  made  many  laborers  redundant  and  their  capacity  was \nunderutilized. Thus, LEs that had been outsourcing the production of parts and components \nbegan to produce them in-house to use redundant laborers. Also, the standardization of \ncomponents induced by the reduction of items made production of components in-house \nmore profitable due to economies of scale. The development of microelectronics reduced the \nrange of skills required\u2014a definite advantage for the SMEs. Quality control and production \nmanagement is easier to do in-house. As technology developments reduced the number of \nman-hours needed on the assembly lines in LEs, the space and labor needed to produce \nparts and components in-house became available (Yoshida 1997). \nA  similar  phenomenon  can  be  observed  in  the  electrical  machinery  industry. 5   The \nstreamlining  of  procurement  by  the  LEs  led  to  the  selection  of  only  the  most  efficient \nsubcontractors. LEs terminated transactions with inefficient subcontractors, possibly leading \nto the observed bipolarization among SMEs. \nThe  change  in  LE  procurement  policies  made  subcontracting  between  LEs  and  SMEs \nunstable. In some cases, parent companies made unfair demands of subcontractors, such \nas requiring them to reduce the prices of components after an agreement had been made. In \nother cases, contracts were terminated suddenly before the agreed upon date. \n2.4  Long-Term Downward Trends in Entry Rates \nThe number of manufacturing establishments employing four to 299 people steadily declined \nfrom 434,754 in 1985 to 254,675 in 2007. The sharp decline in the number of establishments \nwas caused not only by the abolishment of enterprises but also by the lower number of \nenterprises entering the economy. As shown in Figure 2, the entry rate has experienced a \nprolonged decline since the 1970s. The main factor behind this appears to be the trend in \nsole  proprietorships,  which  account  for  a  huge  number  of  Japanese  enterprises.  This \n                                                 \n4 In 1999, Nissan announced its procurement policy to reduce its parts and components suppliers \nfrom 1,145 to less than 600 before March 2002. \n5 In 2009, Sony announced its procurement policy to reduce its parts and components suppliers from \n2,500 to 1,200 before the end of 2010. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nphenomenon, however, should not be regarded entirely as a problem of sole proprietorships \nbecause they have the potential to grow and employ more people. The exit rate has been \nhigher than the entry rate since 1989\u20131991. \nFigure 2: Trends in Entry and Exit Rates \n7\n6\n5\n4\ne\ng\na 3\nt\nn\ne 2\nc\nr\ne\nP 1\n0\n9 2 5 8 1 6 9 1 4 6 9 1 4\n6 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n6 9 2 5 8 1 6 9 1 4 6 9 1\n6 6 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2\nEntry rate Exit rate \n \nNote: The entry rate indicates (1) the average number of establishments launched during a particular period as a \nproportion of (2) the number of establishments already in existence at the start of the period, and is calculated by \ndividing (1) by (2).

It regards the net \noperating profit of each establishment as employer income. The Ministry of Internal Affairs \nand Communications\u2019 Unincorporated Enterprise Survey has data on the manufacturing \nsector\u2019s average net operating profit per establishment. The Ministry of Health, Labor, and \nWelfare\u2019s Basic Survey on Wage Structure also has data on the sector\u2019s average annual \nincome of regular employees in establishments with more than nine regular personnel. The \nemployer-to-employee income ratio is calculated by dividing the average annual income of \nregular employees by the average net operating profit per establishment. The income of \nemployees has risen in absolute terms in enterprises of all sizes since 1974. This rise is \nmore prominent than the rise in the absolute level of entrepreneurs' incomes. The downturn \nin entrepreneurs' incomes in the 1990s accelerated the decline of the employer-to-employee \nincome ratio. The average annual net operating profit per establishment went down from \n\u00a55.2 million in 1993 to \u00a53.1 million in 2006. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nFigure 3: Trends in Employer-to-Employee Income Ratio in Manufacturing \n(Ratio)\n2.20\n2.00\n1.80\n1.60\n1.40\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0.40\n3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5\n7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2\n \nNote: The employer-to-employee income ratio is calculated by dividing the average annual income per regular \nemployee by the average net operating profit per establishment. \nSources: SMEA (2005); Government of Japan, Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Basic Survey on Wage \nStructure (available: http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/database/db-l/index.html [accessed 19 November 2009]); \nGovernment of Japan, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Statistics Bureau, FY 2008 \nUnincorporated Enterprise Survey, Trend Survey (available: http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/ \nListE.do?lid=000001054597 [accessed 19 November 2009]). \nGenda and Kanbayashi (2002) analyzed the micro data and concluded that the probability of \nbeing self-employed decreased greatly among middle-aged workers in both urban and rural \nareas from 1989 to 1994. As labor-intensive processes shifted from metropolitan to rural \nareas, many LEs and SMEs set up factories during the 1980s. Employment opportunities in \nfactories increased dramatically even in rural areas (Kato 2003). The relative decline in the \nincomes of self-employed workers appears to have reduced self-employment and decreased \nthe entry rate of businesses into the economy. \nMoreover, the younger generation has lost interest in setting up enterprises or joining family \nbusinesses as they have a better chance of getting a high, stable salary elsewhere. The \nopportunity cost of setting up a business varies according to each individual and time period. \nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the peak of the age-wage curve for SMEs was people in \ntheir thirties. Many SME entrepreneurs set up their own factories at this age because of their \nmeager salaries as employees (SMEA 1979). For many employees who did not have a high \nlevel of education, starting their own businesses was the better option as it was difficult for \nthem to get a job with a high, stable salary. Setting up their own businesses was a chance to \nimprove their incomes while using their skills. Today, this generation has reached retirement \nage, but many are still running their businesses due to the absence of successors. In 2007, \nfor instance, 47% of self-employed workers in the Japanese manufacturing sector were at \nleast 60 years old (Figure 4). Many SMEs have already shut down their establishments and \nmore are likely to follow owing to the lack of successors to the top position. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nFigure 4: Structure of Self-Employed Workers in Japanese Manufacturing,  \nAccording to Age \n100,000\n80,000\ns\nn\no\ns\nr\ne 60,000\nP\n \nof\n \nr\ne 40,000\nb\nm\nu\nN\n20,000\n0\n9 4 9 4 9 4 9 4 9 4 9 4 9 4 e\n1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 v\no  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  bo\n15 t 20 t 25 t 30 t 35 t 40 t 45 t 50 t 55 t 60 t 65 t 70 t 75 t 80 t d a\nn\na\n5 \nAges 8\n \nSource: Government of Japan, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 2007 Employment Status Survey \n(available: http://www.e-stat.go.jp/estat/html/NewList/000001017285/NewList-000001017285.html [accessed 19 \nNovember 2009]). \nAdvanced machinery is necessary to meet the rising demands of customers. SMEs cannot \nmaintain their businesses without advanced technology and accumulated skills. Thus, entry \ninto manufacturing, particularly for the younger generation, has become more difficult\u2014and \ncostly\u2014than it was during the 1960s. In addition, Japanese SMEs are facing stiff competition \nfrom importers of cheap goods from overseas.  \n3.  IMPACTS OF LONG-TERM RECESSION \nThe Japanese economy has been facing long-term recession with deflation since 1991. \nAlthough gross domestic product growth rates recovered slightly in the mid-1990s, they \nbecame negative in 1998 and 1999 (Figure 5). Nonperforming assets became a serious \nproblem in those years and SMEs faced financial difficulties due to the non-availability of \nbank loans. The shrinking domestic market affected the performance of the manufacturing \nsector and enterprises were burdened by the so-called \u201cthree excesses,\u201d namely, excess \ndebt, excess capacity, and excess employment. \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nFigure 5: Gross Domestic Product Growth Rates \n8.0\n6.0\n4.0\ne\ng\na\nnt 2.0\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n0.0\n5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7\n8 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2\n-2.0\n-4.0\n \nSource: Government of Japan, Cabinet Office web site (available: \nhttp://www.esri.cao.go.jp/en/sna/qe093/gdemenuea.html [accessed 19 November 2009]). \nFigure 6 shows the interest-bearing debt redemption trend among SMEs and LEs between \n1986 and 2007. The period is estimated by dividing outstanding interest-bearing debt at the \nend of each quarter by annual cash flow. Outstanding interest-bearing debt consists of short-\nterm  borrowing,  long-term  borrowing,  and  corporate  bonds.  Cash  flow  is  calculated  by \nadding half of the annual ordinary profit and depreciation expenses. The debt redemption \nperiods for LEs and SMEs were 5.7 and 6.2 years at the end of the first quarter of 1986. \nDuring the economic boom, the gap between SMEs and LEs was smaller. While recession \ndecreased ordinary profit, long-term debt rose continuously and the debt redemption period \nwent up rapidly in the second half of 1993. Banks did not want to restrict themselves from \nextending loans to SMEs simply because they were afraid that their loans would become \nnonperforming assets. As a result, banks increased long-term loans to SMEs between 1990 \nand 1995 in spite of the recession. However, additional loans to avoid financial crunch made \nexcess debt in SMEs more serious. As long-term debt decreased in 2001, financial strength \nstarted to improve in 2003. But this does not mean that the financial conditions of all SMEs \nimproved.  Some  SME  went  bankrupt  with  the  accumulation  of  debt  and  ultimately \ndisappeared from the market. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nFigure 6: Trends in Debt Redemption Periods \n14\ns) 12\nr\na\ne\nY\n(\ns  10\nd\no\nri\ne\nP 8\nn \no\nti\np\nm 6\ne\nd\ne\nR\n4\n2\n6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7\n8 8 9 9 9 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2\nLE SME\n \nLE = large enterprise, SME = small or medium enterprise. \nNotes:  \n1.

The year 1997 was a turning \npoint.  Table  1  suggests  that  small  establishments  have  declined.  The  number  of \nestablishments employing 4\u201329 people decreased by 1.5% per annum between 1985 and \n1997.  The  downward  trend  accelerated  after  1997.  During  the  recession  period,  many \nestablishments closed down. The number of smaller establishments decreased faster and \nthe number of establishments owned by LEs also went down. Although many factors caused \nthe decline in the number of SMEs, the long-term recession is still the main reason. Excess \ndebt had a significant effect on SMEs during the recession and forced many SMEs to exit \nthe market. As expected, employment in SMEs with 4\u2013299 employees also decreased by \n1.2% per annum between 1985 and 1997. The decline became sharp after 1997. Because \nSMEs accounted for a large share of manufacturing establishments, employment in this \nsector went down significantly after 1997. The exit of some SMEs might have led to a \nreduction  of  excess  capacity  and  excess  employment  in  SMEs.  Conversely,  labor \nproductivity has grown in all sizes of establishments in spite of negative or negligible growth \nbetween 1997 and 2007.

This paper adopts the growth accounting approach \nbased on two-input frameworks, taking single deflated value added as output, and labor and \ncapital as inputs. The Translog index of TFP growth is arrived at by using the following \nequation: \n \nSL(t)+SL(t\uff0d1)                 SK(t)+SK(t\uff0d1) \n\u0394lnTFP(t)= \u0394lnY(t)\uff0d[  \u00d7\u0394lnL(t)]\uff0d[                      \u00d7\u0394lnK(t)]  (1) \n  2                                       2 \n \nIn the above equation, Y denotes value added, L denotes labor, and K denotes capital. \u0394ln \nY(t) = ln Y(t) \u2013 ln Y(t-1). In the same way, \u0394ln L(t), and \u0394ln K(t) are defined. SL is the income \nshare of labor, and SK is the income share of capital. SL and SK add up to one. Using the \nabove equation, the growth rates of TFP are computed for each year.  \nThe basic source of data used for the productivity estimates is the Census of Manufacturers. \nTo make price corrections on the reported data on value added, suitable deflators were \nselected from the corporate goods price index.

The regression equation is \nestimated by the fixed-effects model with the year dummy (to identify a dramatic change in a \nspecific year) and without it. \nThe Ministry of Finance\u2019s Database of Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations by \nIndustry categorizes companies into four groups according to capital size: \u00a510\u201350 million, \n\u00a550\u2013100 million, \u00a5100 million\u2013\u00a51 billion, and more than \u00a51 billion. As the classification of \nCensus  of  Manufacturers  depends  on  the  number  of  regular  employees,  conversion  is \nnecessary to use the data from both sources. This paper assumes that enterprises with a \ncapital of \u00a510\u201350 million employ 30\u201399 people, enterprises with a capital of \u00a550\u2013100 million \nemploy 100\u2013299 people, enterprises with a capital of \u00a5100 million\u2013\u00a51 billion employ 300\u2013\n999 people, and enterprises with a capital of more than \u00a51 billion employ more than 999 \npeople.  The  Establishment  and  Enterprise  Census  of  Japan  has  created  a  table \ndifferentiating enterprises by industry, number of regular employees, and amount of capital. \nTable 2 shows the percentage of enterprises that meet the above-mentioned capital size \nconditions for each employment size category. Although enterprises with a capital of \u00a550\u2013\n100 million and \u00a5100 million\u2013\u00a51 billion constitute a relatively small share of those employing \n100\u2013299 and 300\u2013999 employees, respectively, enterprises with a capital of \u00a510\u201350 million \nand more than \u00a51 billion account for more than 70% of enterprises employing 30\u201399 and \n1,000 or more employees, respectively. \nTable 2: Percentage of Enterprises That Meet Both Conditions on Employment Size \nand Capital Size in Total Number of Enterprises in 1999 \n(%) \nNumber of Regular  General  Electrical  Transportation  Precision \nEmployees  Machinery  Machinery  Equipment  Machinery \n30\u201399  75.5  70.1  75.4  75.9 \n100\u2013299  31.2  24.6  28.3  32.6 \n300\u2013999  38.2  45.3  50.2  40.8 \n1,000 or more  86.8  76.7  82.9  73.5 \nNote: The assumption of conversion is based on the following:  \nEnterprises with capital of \u00a510\u201350 million employ 30\u201399 people. \nEnterprises with capital of \u00a550\u2013100 million employ 100\u2013299 people. \nEnterprises with capital of \u00a5100 million\u2013\u00a51, billion employ 299\u2013999 people. \nEnterprises with capital of more than \u00a51 billion employ more than 999 people. \nSource: Government of Japan, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 1999 Establishment and Enterprise \nCensus (available: http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/ListE.do?bid=000000290031&cycode=0 [accessed 19 \nNovember 2009]). \nWhile the TFP estimates were based on the assumption of full utilization of capacity, the \nTFP growth rates might depend on underutilization of capacity due to the recession. This \nstudy estimates utilization rates on the basis of minimum capital output ratio (Sastry 1984). \nCapital output ratios are calculated. A benchmark year is then selected on the basis of the \nobserved lowest capital output ratio. It is considered as capacity output. The estimate of \ncapacity is obtained by dividing real capital stock by the minimum capital output ratio. The \nutilization rate is given by actual output as a proportion of the estimated capacity. \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nThus, \nO \nU =    \u30fb100 \nC \n \nC \nC =         \u30fb100 \n(C/O)min \n \nwhere U is capacity utilization, O is gross value added, and C is the estimated capacity. This \nestimation is crude but there are no better estimates of capacity utilization (Goldar and \nKumari 2003). \nThe regression results presented in Table 3 show a significant and negative correlation \nbetween TFP growth rates and the rate of change in the number of enterprises in both LEs \nand SMEs. It suggests that the decrease in the number of establishments might improve \nTFP growth rates. It can be interpreted that the exit of inefficient SMEs might have raised \nTFP growth rates. A significant and positive correlation between TFP growth rates and \ncapacity utilization can be seen in both LEs and SMEs. Utilization rates might have affected \nTFP growth rates. A correlation between TFP growth rates and a change in the interest-\nbearing debt redemption period was not observed.

It is expected that if \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nworldwide recession permanently shrinks demand in the four industries, more SMEs will be \nforced into closing down. \n4.  REGIONAL VARIATION OF INDUSTRIAL CLUSTERS \nSME  policies  need  to  be  reviewed  from  both  the  industrial  policy  and  regional  policy \nstandpoints for three reasons. First, when an assembly factory is closed down, although the \nimpact on the industry as a whole is limited, the impact on the region is huge. As many \nSMEs that had been supplying the closed factories lose customers, the industrial cluster \nwhere the closed factories are located is affected. Second, the leading industry in a cluster \nmay  change.  When  a  leading  industry  starts  to  decline,  municipal  governments  must \npromote other industries. Third, exchange and tie\u2013ups among SMEs in different industries \nhelp to develop the local economy. In fact, the focus of SME policy has shifted from industry \nto cluster. The collaboration between SMEs in different industries was emphasized in the \n1980s. \nIndustrial clusters can be categorized into four types according to how they were formed \nhistorically and according to their characteristics: (i) company town clusters, (ii) production \nregion clusters, (iii) mixed urban clusters, and (iv) mixed invitation clusters (SMEA 2006). \nThe advantages of the business environment differ according to the type of cluster and have \nchanged in the process of industrialization. \nCompany town clusters are formed by the agglomeration of numerous subcontractor groups \naround the assembly factory of a particular LE. Typical examples are the region around \nToyota City, which has Toyota Motor Corporation at its heart, and Hitachi City, which has \nHitachi at its heart. Cluster regions have developed as a result of enterprises cutting the cost \nof expensive tasks such as production management and the acquisition of new customers, \nand their move to specialize in certain production processes. SMEs benefit from being within \nthe same business groups as the LEs. The success of Toyota Motor Corporation raised the \nnumber of employees living in Toyota City, as well as the value added (at 2000 prices) by \n1.5% and 0.6% between 1997 and 2007, respectively (Table 4). On the other hand, although \nthe number of employees in Hitachi City was more than 40,000 before 1994, it came down to \n25,000 in 2005. In the 1990s, Hitachi shifted the manufacturing base of its home appliances \nabroad. As a result, the number of employees at its major subcontractors was reduced to \nhalf the size it was in the 1970s (Japan Small Business Research Institute 2003). As clusters \nare  affected  by  the  difficulties  experienced  by  LEs,  SMEs  are  forced  to  diversify  their \nbusinesses. The traditional business model of being dependent on certain LEs and doing \nbusiness within the cluster is not functioning as well as it used to. Within the clusters, SMEs \nare discovering new clients and trying to diversify outlets. \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nTable 4: Trends of Manufacturing Establishments Employing More Than Three \nEmployees in Four Types of Clusters \n(%) \nNumber of  Number of \nCategories of  Value Added \nEstablishments  Employees \nClusters \n1985\u2013 1997\u2013 1985\u2013 1997\u2013 1985\u2013 1997\u2013\nName of Cities \n1997  2007  1997  2007  1997  2007 \nCompany Town \nToyota  -0.5*  -0.2*  0.4*  1.5  -0.6*  0.6 \nHitachi  -2.5  -3.6  -1.1  -3.5  2.2*  0.3* \nProduction Region \nTsubame  -1.6  -3.7  -1.3  -3.1  2.3  0.2* \nSabae  -0.7*  -5.0   -1.0   -3.4  1.7  -3.5 \nMixed Urban \nSumida  -3.7  -6.2  -3.5  -5.3  0.4*  4.9* \nOta  -3.5  -4.2*  -4.1  -5.9  -0.5*  -4.6 \nHigashi-Osaka  -1.5  -3.7  -1.4  -3.4  1.1*  -2.7 \nMixed Invitation \nKitakami  1.5  -2.1  2.9  -1.1  4.6  2.9* \nKofu  -3.8  -4.8*  -1.7  -2.7*   2.6  -0.4* \nNote: * Statistically insignificant at 95% confidence level. \nSource: Government of Japan, Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Census of Manufacturers (available: \nhttp://www.meti.go.jp/statistics/tyo/kougyo/archives/index.html [accessed 1 June 2009]). \nProduction region clusters are formed by enterprises belonging to a specific industry, such \nas consumer goods, concentrating in a particular region that has grown through the sharing \nof raw materials and technologies that accumulated in that region. Typical examples are the \nTsubame-Sanjyo region in Niigata Prefecture, where cutlery and blade manufacturers have \nclustered, and Sabae City in Fukui Prefecture, where eyeglass frame manufacturers have \nclustered. SMEs in these regions receive orders through a joint order-taking system and \nhave established a system of division of labor within the cluster to manufacture cheap, high-\nquality, mass-produced goods. However, tough competition with cheap goods produced in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China has shrunk their domestic and export markets. Their system \nof mass production, which has been a source of competitive advantage, appears to be \nperforming  less  well  today.  Heavy  dependence  on  certain  industries  and  the  highly \nsegmented and specialized production processes prevent the clusters from adjusting to the \nnew business environment (SMEA 2006). The number of establishments and employees \nhas clearly declined since 1997 in Tsubame and Sabae. In Sabae City, some SMEs are \ntrying  to  enter  the  precision  machinery  and  medical  equipment  industries  utilizing \naccumulated skills. \nMixed urban clusters have formed in urban areas. There are many such clusters in the \nmachinery and metalworking industries, and there often occurs a division of labor between \nenterprises in the same cluster, as well as business relations that cut across traditional \nindustry groupings. Typical examples include Sumida City and Ota City in Tokyo Prefecture \nand Higashi-Osaka City in Osaka Prefecture. The number of establishments in Sumida and \nOta decreased sharply even before the boom period began in 1985. Rising land prices \nencouraged  the  diversion  of  factory  sites  to  housing  areas.  Recession  accelerated  the \ndownward trends in the three cities between 1997 and 2007. But, some SMEs are growing. \nAs it is difficult to establish systems of mass production in urban areas, where the cost of \nland and labor is relatively high, clusters located in urban areas specialize in high value-\nadded products. Production functions in such clusters are based on flexible divisions of labor \nas  a  result  of  the  clustering  of  diverse  industries  and  technologies.  Consequently,  the \nclusters have been able to respond to changes in the industrial structure during the long-\n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nterm  recession.  It  is  noteworthy  that  SMEs  in  these  clusters  have  the  production  and \nprocessing abilities to deal with product development and trials. \nMixed  invitation  clusters  are  formed  as  a  result  of  local  government  efforts  to  attract \nenterprises and the implementation of industrial relocation plans. During the 1970s, the \ngovernment regulated the size of factory sites in metropolitan areas and subsidized the \ntransfer of factory sites to rural areas. As many of the invited SMEs belong to industry \ngroups outside the cluster, collaboration within the clusters has not been very active. Typical \nexamples  are  the  Kitakamigawa  basin  region  in  Iwate  Prefecture  and  Kofu  City  in \nYamanashi Prefecture. The clusters have developed because of the increasing number of \nlabor-intensive  plants,  enticed  by  large  orders  from  enterprises  in  that  region  and  the \ncomparatively cheap labor. Some SMEs in mixed urban clusters set up secondary factories \nin mixed invitation clusters due to regulations pertaining to factory sites. Various SMEs have \nbeen added to these clusters such that they have become more complex and are no longer \ndependent on a specific industry. However, some factories have withdrawn from the clusters \ndue  to  the  availability  of  cheaper  labor  in  other  Asian  countries.  The  number  of \nestablishments decreased in Kofu City and Kitakawa City during the 1990s. This shows that \nwith globalization, cheap labor is fading as a competitive edge for clusters in Japan. \nThe above analysis suggests that diversification and collaboration that cut across traditional \nindustry groupings are key points to activating the local economy. Although the decline in the \nnumber of SMEs has been a common phenomenon in the four types of clusters, some \nclusters are still creating new businesses by taking advantage of more flexible divisions of \nlabor. \n5.  SME POLICIES IN JAPAN \nSME policies in Japan have been modified to adjust to changing economic conditions. SME \npolicies during the 1980s were noteworthy for three reasons. First, they tried to encourage \nR&D in SMEs, rather than the diffusion of existing technology. SMEs could get low-interest \nloans  from  government  financial  institutions  after  local  governments  approved  their \ntechnology  development  plans  in  high-technology  areas  such  as  electronics  and \nbiotechnology. Subsidies and tax concessions were provided for R&D activities conducted \nby SMEs. Second, the government recognized the positive effects of technology exchange \nand tie-ups among SMEs in different industries and began to encourage these activities. \nDuring the recession in the 1970s, SMEs in the machinery industry collaborated to produce \nhigh value-added products. The collaboration was effective for the joint development of unit \ncomponents. Thus, in 1981, the government started technology exchange plaza projects to \nfacilitate exchange and tie-ups among SMEs in each prefecture. In 1988, the government \nbegan  to  subsidize  and  give  tax  concessions  to  new  technology  developments  by \ncooperative  associations  among  SMEs  in  different  industries.  Third,  the  government \nencouraged  new  project  ideas.  Prefectural  and  municipal  governments  and  the  private \nsector got together and set up business incubators to reactivate local economies negatively \naffected  by  the  recession.  Subsidies  from  the  government  and  low-interest  loans  from \ngovernment  financial  institutions  were  provided  to  incubator  projects.  However,  the \noccupation ratio of incubator projects was low due to the high rents. Such high rents were \ncharged because prefectural and municipal governments gave priority to the acquisition of \nsubsidies from the central government over careful examination of the feasibility of projects \n(Kurose 2006). \nThe Small and Medium Enterprise Basic Law was revised fundamentally in 1999. It was \nconsidered the backbone of SME policies. Its policy concept was to rectify the gap between \nSMEs and  LEs in terms of labor productivity by upgrading the structure of SMEs and \nimproving the conditions of trade. The government also recognized that SMEs could not \nintroduce modern technology given their small size and the excessive competition among \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nthem.  The  policy  concept  had  already  been  changed  from  modernization  to  business \nconversion in the 1980s. Moreover, business innovations and start-ups were encouraged in \nthe 1990s. \nAmendment of the law confirmed the change in SME polices. The new Small and Medium \nEnterprise Basic Law was based on a new philosophy of promoting diverse and vigorous \ngrowth and the development of independent SMEs rather than on rectifying gaps. It has \nthree  key  goals:  (i)  promoting  business  innovation  and  new  business  start-ups,  (ii) \nstrengthening the management base of SMEs, and (iii) facilitating adaptation to economic \nand social changes. Business innovation is a broad concept and covers new products that \nSMEs are trying to develop and produce. The new law does not have any intent to direct \nSMEs in specific areas, as was the case with the old law. SME policies became competition-\noriented. Moreover, the new law defined the responsibility of municipal governments. Before \nthe  amendment,  only  the  central  and  prefectural  governments  were  involved  in  SME \npromotion. \nHowever, SME policies cannot stop the long trend of SME decline during the recession. The \nexit of many SMEs has significantly affected local economies. Some municipal governments \nhave  implemented  local  ordinances  promoting  SME  development  to  activate  their  local \neconomies. Municipal governments can play an important role in collecting information, \ninteracting with SMEs, and organizing exchange among SMEs. \nIn 1979, Sumida City became the first municipality in which the government implemented a \nlocal ordinance on SME development. The SME promotion policies of Sumida City are \nunique for three reasons. First, the government set up a database containing pertinent \ninformation about SMEs in the city. In 1977 and 1978, 180 employees of the city office \nvisited all 9,313 registered establishments to conduct a survey. They also carried out a \nhearing with personnel of the SMEs. The hearing was a good opportunity for employees of \nthe city office to understand the problems that SMEs were facing. The experience was useful \nin the development of a master plan for SME promotion in 1986, 1989, and 2003. Second, \nSME  owners  were  given  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  policymaking.  In  1980,  the \ngovernment set up the Industrial Promotion Committee, which consisted of SME owners, \nexperts,  and  government  employees.  In  consultation  with  the  said  committee,  the \ngovernment runs an SME center that has technical advisers and is equipped with expensive \nmachine tools and instruments that SMEs in the city can use. Third, SME promotion was \nstrengthened  by  linking  it  to  local  tourism.  The  Industrial  Promotion  Committee \nrecommended  the  setting  up  of small  museums  to  present  the  industry  and  culture  of \nSumida City to local and foreign tourists, as well as small shops on the premises of the \nfactories to sell products made by Sumida City SMEs. SME promotion thus became a part of \npolicies to activate the local economy. \nThe  direction  of  SME  policies  can  be  appreciated  on  three  fronts. First,  private  sector \ninitiatives  are  being  facilitated.  The  government  should  not  force  business  models  like \nmodernization policies. SMEs have the ability to find new business areas. Second, R&D \nactivities are being encouraged. SMEs have a competitive advantage in R&D activities \nbecause they can specialize in niche areas. Third, municipal governments can play an \nimportant role in promoting SMEs. Some municipal governments have followed the best \npractice of Sumida City. Based on the experience of Sumida City, they have learned to give \npriority to SME promotion, tap local resources, and take into consideration the character of \nthe local economy when making their plans. They likewise have realized the importance of \nthe interaction between the local governments and SMEs in making their plans work. \n6.  RESULTS OF FIELD SURVEY \nTo investigate diversification by SMEs and its policy implications, a survey was conducted in \nOta City of Tokyo Prefecture and in Southern Kyoto Prefecture in May, June, and November \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nof 2004. The target SMEs were selected mainly from the award-winning SMEs in Ota City \nand  Kyoto  Prefecture.  Most  of  them  were  above-average  SMEs  in  terms  of  standard \nqualities and had unique traits. Table 5 shows the characteristics of each company. Those in \nOta City had flexible divisions of labor as mentioned earlier. Although the government of Ota \nCity enacted local ordinances that affect SME development and has been actively promoting \nSME development, the number of SMEs has declined since the 1980s. After the factory sites \nin metropolitan areas were regulated, some SMEs established their secondary factories for \nmass production in rural areas. As Southern Kyoto is close to Osaka, subcontracting SMEs \nhave developed in the area. SMEs in Japan are becoming less competitive in labor-intensive \nprocesses as a result of competition from neighboring Asian countries. SMEs that are doing \nwell in urban areas might have lessons to offer.

With the high price of land and high wages that \nput SMEs in urban areas at a disadvantage, they must have unique sales points. Five SMEs \ndeveloped original products that other companies, including LEs, were not producing and \nwere selling them. Other SMEs also had special skills that other companies could not imitate \neasily. For example, although a metal processing SME has higher margin rates than other \ncompanies because it can only process difficult-to-cut materials in the short term, it can get \norders regularly. Originality, unique technology, and skill are more important than production \ncosts for SMEs in urban areas. \nSecond, three of the 20 SMEs were R&D-oriented business ventures that concentrate on the \ndesign  and  development  of  new  products.  The  first  SME  produced  equipment  for \nmechanization. It had obtained patents from Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, and United \nStates. The managing director pointed out the possibility of a development-oriented venture \nbusiness. As LEs reduced the number of engineers on staff during the recession, they must \nrely on outsourcing to develop peripheral equipment. The second SME also mentioned the \nsame point. Because small venture companies look for niche markets, they have many \nopportunities  to  develop  various  products.  Although  experience  is  necessary  for  the \ndevelopment of new products, engineers in LEs do not often get many chances to expand \ntheir  expertise  because  they  concentrate  only  on  major  projects.  Meanwhile,  SMEs \nconcentrate on product design, development, and sales, but outsource manufacturing. The \nthird SME is shifting to become an engineering company so it is likely that it will stop \nmanufacturing in the future. \nThird, four of the 17 SMEs in Ota City were located in industrial apartments. They had \nfactories on the lower floors and residences on the higher floors. It is noteworthy that two \nR&D-oriented business ventures were in such industrial apartments. It can be surmised that \nindustrial apartments helped some new industry-oriented SMEs to enter the market. \nFourth, five of the 20 SMEs had secondary factories in rural areas. Secondary factories take \ncharge of mass production, while head factories concentrate on small-amount production of \nmany varieties of products related to R&D and trials. \nFifth, four of the 20 SMEs were subcontractors. Among them, three SMEs had transactions \nwith other companies while only one completely depended on a parent company. That \ncompany is eventually going to move its operations to the People\u2019s Republic of China to \nfollow its parent company. This shows that dependence on a parent company makes the \nmanagement base of an SME fairly weak. \nThe above analysis suggests three ways through which SMEs can survive in urban areas. \nFirst, SMEs that have outstanding technology and special skills can survive. Although SMEs \nin urban areas do not have an advantage in mass production, they have the edge in small-\namount production of many varieties of products. As LEs in metropolitan areas actively \nconduct R&D, SMEs have a chance to be involved in trials and R&D-related business. \nSecond, R&D-oriented business ventures have the opportunity to grow in niche areas. As \nmanufacturing is outsourced, efficient links between the R&D efforts of SMEs in urban areas \nand manufacturing spots is important. Third, setting up industrial apartments is an effective \nway to relax constraints for new industry-oriented SMEs looking to set up factory sites in \nurban areas. \n7.  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \nDuring the long-term recession, the streamlining of procurement by LEs changed the multi-\ntier subcontracting system. LEs reduced the number of suppliers and components they \nused. While efficient SMEs selected by LEs were able to expand their business, inefficient \nSMEs lost customers. The regression results show a significant and negative correlation \n22 ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nbetween TFP growth rates and the rate of change in the number of enterprises in four \nindustries: general machinery, electrical machinery, transportation equipment, and precision \nmachinery. This suggests that a decrease in the number of establishments might improve \nTFP growth rates. It can be interpreted that the exit of inefficient SMEs might have raised \nTFP growth rates. Only efficient SMEs that meet the demands of cost, quality, and delivery \nfrom LEs will survive during the present recession. It is expected that if worldwide recession \npermanently shrinks demand in the four industries, more SMEs will be forced into closing \ndown. \nAlthough the decline in the number of SMEs has been a common phenomenon in the four \ntypes of clusters, some SMEs have still been able to create new businesses by taking \nadvantage  of  more  flexible  divisions  of  labor.  The  traditional  business  model  of  being \ndependent on certain LEs and doing business within the cluster is not functioning as well as \nit used to. Heavy dependence on certain industries and highly segmented and specialized \nproduction processes prevent the clusters from adjusting to the new business environment. \nSME policies must encourage diversification and collaboration that cut across traditional \nindustry groupings to form flexible divisions of labor. \nSMEs in Japan are becoming less competitive in labor-intensive processes, as a result of \nstiff competition from neighboring Asian countries. SMEs that are doing well in urban areas \nmight have some lessons to offer. Results of a field survey suggest three ways in which \nSMEs can survive in urban areas. First, SMEs that have outstanding technology and special \nskills can survive. Although SMEs in urban areas do not have the edge in mass production, \nthey do have an advantage in small-amount production for many products. Second, R&D-\noriented business ventures have a chance to grow in niche areas. As manufacturing is \noutsourced,  efficient  links  between  the  R&D  efforts  of  SMEs  in  urban  areas  and \nmanufacturing spots is important. Third, setting up industrial apartments is an effective way \nto relax constraints for new industry-oriented SMEs looking to set up factory sites in urban \nareas. \nThe following policy recommendations are based on this analysis: \n\u2022  Unfair trade should be regulated by law. In some cases, parent companies have \nmade unfair demands of subcontractors, such as demanding that they reduce the \nprices  of  components  after  an  agreement  had  been  signed.  In  other  cases, \ncontracts have been abruptly terminated. Such unfair treatment might affect SMEs. \n\u2022  Although the financing of working capital for SMEs has been secured, careful \nexamination  of  additional  financing  is  necessary.  Although  the  recession \ndecreased ordinary profits, banks increased long-term loans to SMEs between \n1991  and  1995  because  they  were  afraid  that  these  loans  would  become \nnonperforming assets. Additional loans to avoid financial crunch made excess debt \nin SMEs more serious. \n\u2022  The  entry  of  SMEs  should  be  encouraged  by  providing  incentives  such  as \nsubsidies, low-interest loans, tax concessions, and incubator facilities as these can \ncontribute to employment creation and the opening of new industries. The costs of \nentering the market have risen due to technological development in the past years. \nAdvanced machinery is necessary to meet the increasing demands of customers. \nSMEs  cannot  maintain  their  businesses  without  advanced  technology  and \naccumulated skills. Entry into manufacturing, particularly by the young generation, \nis thus becoming more difficult than it was during the 1960s. On the other hand, \nR&D-oriented business ventures have a chance to grow in niche areas. Such entry \nshould be supported by policies. \n\u2022  Municipal governments should play an active role in coordinating collaboration that \ncuts across traditional industry groupings. Based on the experience of Sumida City, \nmunicipal governments have learned to give priority to SME promotion, tap local \n23 ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nresources, and take into consideration the character of the local economy when \nmaking  their  plans.  They  likewise  realized  the  importance  of  the  interaction \nbetween local governments and SMEs to make their plans work. \n24 ", "ADBI Working Paper 169    Uchikawa \n \nREFERENCES \nAsanuma, B. 1989.
