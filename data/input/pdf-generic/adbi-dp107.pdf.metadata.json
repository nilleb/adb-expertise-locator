INTRODUCTION \nIn developing countries, the markets for agrifood products are changing at a pace that is \nunparalleled  in  modern  history,  becoming  increasingly  open  and  homogenized  toward \ninternational standards. New distribution channels, dominated by larger firms, are imposing \nhigher performance demands, including social and environmental standards, throughout the \nvalue chains. Traditional ways of doing business are often no longer adequate, resulting in \nnew challenges for small and medium farms. Acquiring the technical know-how and financial \nresources to incorporate standards such as quality assurance, safety, and traceability is \ndifficult  and  failure  to  do  so  marginalizes  many  small  and  medium  farms  and  agro-\nenterprises. \nThe public institutions that could traditionally provide such support to farmers have steadily \neroded and are now often non-existent. Until the late 1980s, rural development was typically \nstate-focused, with public institutions controlling the systems and infrastructure for agri-\nmarket inputs and outputs. These institutions were, for the most part, unceremoniously \nscrapped as their shortcomings became evident, free-market theories became prominent, \nand structural adjustment took hold. Their role in supporting smaller, more marginalized or \nremote producers, however, was important in facilitating equitable access to information and \nmarkets. Consequently, their absence in poorer regions has exacerbated market failures and \nleft a vacuum that is not often adequately filled by the private sector. \nThrough the lenses of value chain theory and institutional economics, we are beginning to \nbetter understand the interrelationship of private sector agricultural production and trade with \nthe emerging processes of civil governance. From such understanding can emerge the \nnecessary innovation and support required to provide sustainable solutions to the challenges \nof necessary capacity building or long-term financing required by smaller farmers and rural \nentrepreneurs who want to participate in the value chain. Without effective public and civic \ninstitutions, the ability of smaller farms and enterprises to participate is reduced. \nII.  NEW DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS' MARKET \nACCESS  \nDue to improved logistics, faster communication, and fewer trade barriers, markets are \nincreasingly  open  as  well  as  increasingly  homogenized  toward  international  standards. \nLarge farming systems are incorporating greater skills and more investment in technology \nand infrastructure to enable more controlled and large-scale production that is difficult for \nsmaller farmers to achieve. The new market access challenges faced by smaller farmers do \nnot  apply  just  to  exports  since  national  or  internal  markets  are  beginning  to  imitate \ninternational standards, as part of a shift in the structure of distribution channels away from \nsmall local markets toward, for example, supermarkets. \nSupermarkets typically procure steady supply and large volumes of products from suppliers. \nFor small farms, to enter into a supermarket\u2019s procurement system may require heavy \ncapital and technological investment as well as a more skilled labor force. Agricultural \nstandards play an important role in these procurement systems. Often, farmers simply \ncannot meet these standards on their own (Reardon and Berdegu\u00e9 2002ab). Arrangements \nsuch as contract farming are one way to resolve the uneven relationships between many \nsmall suppliers and a few large buyers. \nAgricultural standards evolved over the course of many years and were in essence codified \npublicly by regular accepted use, but the last decade or so has seen dramatic changes. New \nand often private standards are demanded by buyers in order to meet their value chain \nmanagement needs or to reduce their exposure to risk.  \n ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nHow standards drive developments in the global agrifood system is intimately linked with \nfunctions of governance within the value chain; that is, conditions for participation in the \nchain are set, implemented, monitored, and enforced. In the past, these rules mainly dealt \nwith meeting basic cost parameters and guaranteeing supply. However, as outlined by \nGiovannucci  and  Reardon  (2000),  standards  have  now  become  tools  for  product \ndifferentiation, playing new roles as strategic tools that are used for market penetration, \nsafety  assurance,  traceability,  quality  control,  incorporation  of  social  and  environmental \nguidelines, and even the definition of product niches.  \nSmallholders in the supply chain often lack the internal capacity and the economies of scale \nto establish effective quality assurance and traceability systems. Small enterprises and \nproducers, especially sectors that are export-dependent, may be marginalized unless they \ncan make standard compliance cost effective and guarantee traceability for the buyers.  \nGlobal Developments Driving New Trade Processes \nToday, because there is great exposure and public risks when standards fail to maintain \nfood safety or when they permit social and environmental harm, they are driving a number of \nnew  processes  such  as  Hazard  Analysis  at  Critical  Control  Points  (HACCP)  and \nsustainability standards such as organics. The globalization of these value chains and the \nenormous volumes and concentrations of buying power can mean dramatic consequences \nfor thousands or even millions of people. Recent scares, like mad cow disease, avian flu, or \nE. coli, have demonstrated how the failure of standards can cripple an entire subsector, even \nacross developed nations such as the US and UK. As a result, not only firms but also \ngovernments and consumers are increasingly concerned. \nThis concern is being progressively translated as higher requirements for market entry, \nincluding food safety, traceability, higher quality, and even certifications of process, i.e., \nHACCP, ethical, Fair Trade, organic, etc. These requirements are being driven by changes \nin three major areas: \n1.  A new consumer environment  \nCharacterized by a predominant interest in personal health and increasing doubt in the \nability  of  government  to  ensure  food  safety,  this  includes  broader  concerns  such  as \nunchecked  chemical  use  in  livestock  that  has  led  to  antibiotic  resistance  in  humans.1 \nIncreased  transparency  and  communications  has  led  to  more  information  and  greater \nconcern about the social and environmental conditions in the place of origin.  \n2.  A new business environment \nIn  the  agrifood  business,  an  increasing  concentration  of  suppliers,  intermediaries,  and \nretailers stimulates new methods of differentiation and spur a more intense drive for new \nsupply sources and greater efficiencies in costs and logistics. As global corporations face \nnew risks, they adopt various risk management techniques, especially the demand for more \nstandards. Fulponi (2005) notes that setting standards above minimum levels and requiring \nthird-party certification and traceability are a corporate response to the risk of civil or criminal \nresponsibility. These risks are not only based on food safety but also concerns for labor \nviolations such as those reported in some cacao production regions, worker safety in flower \n                                                 \n1 One of the world\u2019s most prominent medical associations warned of the dire human health consequences of the \nincreasing resistance to antibiotics in the US where only 12 percent of all antibiotics are used for humans and \nthe remaining 88 percent are routinely fed in intensive livestock operations (New England Journal of Medicine, \n1999). That journal has also noted that a likely result is that antibiotic-resistant infections had increased 800 \npercent between 1992 and 1997. Some countries have banned the routine prophylactic use on livestock, and \nDenmark, for example, saw its antibiotic resistance drop from 82 percent to 12 percent (Robbins, 2003). \n2 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nindustries and fish packing plants, and below-subsistence wages in the coffee industry. In \nrecent years, a record number of leading global companies voluntarily reported on social and \nenvironmental issues within their firms (Global Corporate Responsibility Reporting Trends \n2006). Many used independent audits to help ensure their transparency and credibility. \n3.  A new regulatory environment \nAs more and more food is traded globally, all governments struggle to monitor and manage \nthe safety of their food supplies, typically by imposing new barriers to entry in the form of \npublic standards, including import bans to manage a variety of livestock diseases or stiffer \nborder  inspections  for  contamination  and  phytosanitary  violations.  In  some  cases, \ngovernments resort to regulations such as the US bioterrorism laws and the EU's Maximum \nResidue Levels or GMO restrictions. \nThese three environments have combined to stimulate the evolution of numerous standards. \nAs public standards have multiplied, so have those mandated by private industry. Since \n1995, more private international food-related standards have emerged than in the previous \nfive decades combined. Clearly, standards have become an important competitive factor and \nare becoming an important determinant of access to markets.  \nStandards Increasingly Set the Rules of the Game \nStandards offer quality and safety assurance as well as differentiate and define product \ncategories. In addition to food safety, taste, cosmetic quality, and nutritional value, they \nincreasingly involve process requirements such as environmental impact, worker health and \nsafety, animal welfare, and fairness to primary producers. In some cases, suppliers are \nrequired to provide reasonable assurance of social and environmental benefits that range \nfrom an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) series to HACCP to Organics. \nSuch  requirements  can  either  facilitate  market  penetration  or  act  as  barriers  to  entry. \nAccordingly, standards are the new rules and they are evolving dynamically. Indeed, a \ncommon argument for private standards is that firms believe they can more quickly respond \nto market needs by controlling their own standards. Understanding and meeting them is \nbecoming increasingly challenging. \nAs incomes grow, so does the tendency to consume perishable foods such as meat, dairy, \nand aquatic products that are more susceptible to conveying life-threatening diseases. This \ntendency  may  be  fueled  by  greater  communication  and  trade  influencing  consumption \npatterns to resemble those of US and European consumers, whose tastes have been toward \ngreater consumption of meat and dairy products where food safety standards are critical. \nConcomitantly, governments have become more sensitive to agriculture safety as scares \nranging from BSE to avian flu impact human health and wreak economic havoc in some \nregions.2 \nThese shifts mean  more pressure on producers and processors to comply, and many \nenterprises are simply not prepared. In the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\u2014where the \nmajority  of  processors  are  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SME)\u2014the  total  number  of \nprocessors has shrunk by two-thirds in the past decade as food processing has shifted from \ntraditional, lower-risk products to meat, dairy, and aquatic products and horticultural produce \nthat require higher standards and greater investments (see Figure 1).  \n                                                 \n2 For example, outbreaks of avian influenza in Southeast Asia during 2004 and 2005 halted the production and \ntrade in poultry products, affected suppliers of feed and other inputs, severely reduced tourism, and seriously \naffected other parts of the economy, not least of all the deaths of some 204 people up to November 2007. \nEstimates of the economic loss are around 1.5 percent of the GDP for some of those affected countries. \n3 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nFigure 1: Output Structure in Chinese Food-processing Industries,  \nPercentage of Total 1998\u20132003 \n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nRice & Feed (milled)  Sugar Aquatic products\n  Meat & Eggs Vegetable oil Other  \nSource: Adapted from data of Chinese Food Industries Year Book, 1999\u20132004 in Lu (2005). \nA report released by Rabobank predicts that the PRC will become the world's third-largest \nfresh produce exporter within three years.3 Despite ongoing difficulties with meeting some \nstandards in advanced markets, the PRC is forging ahead with high-value exports and has \ninvested in standards and control systems to manage this output. It already produces half of \nthe world's fruit and vegetables, mostly for domestic consumption, and exports of these \nproducts  reached  US$7.2  billion  in  2006.  According  to  FAOSTAT,  this  represents  a \nsubstantial 7% of global trade in fruit and vegetables and trails only the Netherlands, the US, \nand Spain.4  \nExperience from other regions already points to some difficulties. Jaffee and Henson (2004) \nnote that the rejection of agricultural imports due to not meeting standards cost low- and \nmiddle-income countries about US$1.6 billion in 2000\u20132001. In 2002, the PRC, Thailand, \nTurkey, Brazil, and Viet Nam accounted for nearly 60% of the EU's rejections from non-EU \nsources (Jaffee and Henson, 2004). USDA and FDA statistics note a rising trend in such \nfood safety problems, with reports almost doubling from 1994 to 2004 (Center for Science in \nthe Public Interest, 2007), and these US agencies plan to advocate preventive controls, \nincluding higher import safety standards. \nGovernance  \nStandards take different forms. They may be set in commercial legal codes and subject to \nfines if transgressed, they may be internationally recognized and widely used even though \nthey have no specific legal basis, or they may be private, firm-specific requirements (see \nTable 1).  \nStandards can be enforced by participants within the chain as well as by external agencies. \nFrom within the chain, the key sanction is excluding a supplier from participating. The \nconverse of this is that well-performing suppliers can be favored with longer-term contracts \nand higher prices (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2001). Sanctions may also be exercised outside the \nchain, and many governments have extensive bureaucracies checking compliance with \nlegislation and even prosecuting offenders. In recent years, NGOs have grown into an \nimportant sanctioning force. Boycotts and publicity campaigns, or the threat of them, have \nalso forced many leading firms to change the way they produce or to delist particular \nsuppliers (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2001).  \n                                                 \n3 Cited in \u201cChina inching up world exporter list.\u201d Accessed September 2007: http://www.freshinfo.com/index. \nphp?s=n&ss=nd&sid=40288&s_txt=Patrick+Vizzone+China&s_date=0&ms=7.5261569023132&offset= \n4 The Netherlands figure is skewed by considerable trans-shipments through its ports, and Spain\u2019s is heavily \ndependent on a few citrus crops. \n4 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nTable 1:  Characterizing Different Types of Standards \nInternationally  Regionally  Firm \nType of Codification  Legal Codification \nAgreed   Specific   Specific  \n(cid:131) Codex Alimentarius  Chiquita \n(cid:131) Food hygiene  \n(cid:131) Grades of wheat  (cid:131) EU MRLs  residue and \nProduct   standards \n(cid:131) Moisture level for  (cid:131) EU GMO limits  size \n \nType of  coffee beans  standards  \nstandard  \n(cid:131) Workplace  (cid:131) ISO9000 (quality)   Starbucks \n(cid:131) BRC \nProcess   health and safety  (cid:131) SA8000 (labor)  sourcing \n(cid:131) ASEAN-GAP   \nstandards    (cid:131) Fair Trade  practices  \nSource: Adapted with changes and additions from Kaplinsky and Morris (2001). \nWhat is common to value chains is the increasing concentration of power among a few \nactors,  leading  to  increased  horizontal  and  vertical  coordination.  The  considerable \npurchasing power of large-scale retailers in particular, enables them to set private standards \nthat are typically diverse, can be confusing, and are always more demanding than the public \nsafety standards of most countries. Since standards can be influenced considerably by both \npublic and private sectors, producers and processors of agricultural products have to serve \nmany masters. \nThe world\u2019s largest grocery retail markets by value are now the USA, Japan, the PRC, India, \nand the UK, and by 2020 the PRC is expected to more than double its value and move into \nsecond place. All these markets share development characteristics defined by the nature of \ntheir distribution channels. Today's retail food industry increasingly resembles the definition \nof  a  classic  oligopolistic  industry.  At  the  top  are  large  multi-unit  retailers  that  tend  to \ndominate consumer food distribution in many countries. For example, in the US the top five \nsupermarket chains accounted for over 40% of retail food sales in 2000, while in 1993 they \naccounted for 20%. In France during this same period, the top five chains increased market \nshare from 48 to 61% while in Italy it more than doubled from 11 to 25% (Busch and Bain, \n2004).  \nThe largest are powerful multinationals and include US-based Wal-Mart with more than \n5,000  mostly  hypermarket-type  stores,  France-based  Carrefour  with  more  than  11,000 \nstores  of  varying  formats,  and  Netherlands-based  Royal  Ahold  with  more  than  5,000 \nsupermarkets. As reference, their annual revenue is greater than the total value of any \ncountry's agriculture sector. Wal-Mart revenues, for example, topped $300 billion, and its \ninternational sales exceeded $70 billion in 2006. Such dominant players are the major \ndrivers behind a staggering global flow of commodities, products, information, and finance \nthat  coordinate  the  activities  of  hundreds  of  millions  of  farmers  and  affect  billions  of \nconsumers.5  \n                                                 \n5 As an example, in Europe while there are around 3.2 million farmers and 160 million consumers, there are in \nfact only 600 supermarket companies and 100 wholesale distributors supplying the majority of the markets \n(Grievink, 2003). While most of the major supermarket chains have their own integrated distributor systems, \nthe smaller chains and independents rely on  outsourcing their purchasing and distribution systems to \nindependent wholesalers. In another example from Australia, three supermarkets (Woolworths, Coles, and \nFranklins) control nearly 80 of the grocery sales, and three wholesalers (Davids, Australian Independent \nWholesalers, and Foodland Associated Limited) supply all retailers (COA, 1999). AIW, is a subsidiary of \nWoolworths. The concentration of buying power in a few companies means that it is very difficult for \nsmallholder farmers from developing countries to gain access to such high-value markets. \n5 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nProducers and SMEs Face Difficult Hurdles \nDeveloping country producers and SMEs face a number of hurdles to participate effectively \nin higher-value trade. An IFPRI article (Hazell, 2004) refers to the often-stated need for \nbetter  infrastructure,  linking  to  markets,  and  credit  (among  others)  and  notes  that \nnonetheless, these still do not sufficiently address the problems of compliance with an \nincreasingly complex standards environment. \nProject  effectiveness  reviews  for  the  countries  of  the  Africa,  Caribbean,  and  Pacific \nsignatories  of  the  Lom\u00e9  Convention,  looking  at  Quality  &  Conformity  in  the  Fruit  & \nVegetables Subsectors, note that private standards present formidable technical barriers \nthat  have  a  negative  effect  on  smallholders.  Exporters  select  only  the  best-performing \nsmallholders to be organized into groups, and these are expected to manage food safety \nand traceability systems. In addition to the high cost of certification, there is evidence that \nweaker  farmers  are  often  excluded.  For  example,  one  of  Zambia\u2019s  largest  horticulture \nexporters limits itself to source only one product from smallholder producers.6 The exporter \nfears that if the smallholder cooperative cannot meet the required standards, it may risk \nlosing its Global-GAP certification.  \nInstitutional structures are necessary to achieve a form of vertical coordination that can \novercome  transactions  costs  and  standards  barriers  that  smallholders  face.  In  the \nPhilippines, as in other countries, the growing popularity of contract hog farming allows feed \nmillers to use smallholders\u2019 labor and land, and to fatten hogs at low cost. Such small-scale \nlivestock operations have thrived in many regional markets. As that changes, and large-\nscale  industrial  operations  become  ever  more  dominant,  small  enterprises  without  the \nsupport of institutional structures and organizations are less likely to survive. \nThe Growth of New Distribution Channels \nRecent studies point to the shift in marketing channels available to producers and the rapid \nrise of supermarkets in developing countries (Reardon, 2005; Bingen and Busch, 2005; \nFulponi, 2005; Reardon et al., 2003; Moustier et al., 2005). The 1990s saw the emergence of \nsupermarkets  as  a  major  form  of  retailing  in  many  developing  countries  (see  Box  1), \nbecoming dominant players in many Latin American countries with the trend moving rapidly \nin East and Southeast Asia and more slowly in South Asia (see Figure 2).  This development \nis substantially transforming the nature and the composition of domestic agrifood commerce \nas well as regional and overseas trade. \nBox 1: Supermarkets Emerge in USand Explode in Latin America and Asia\nDevelopments around the supermarket concept are representative of trends experienced in other multi-store \nretail formats. The supermarket\u2014self-serve, larger scale retailer often with more than one check-out counter\u2014\nemerged in the US about 75 years ago.  \n \nBetween 1925 and 1955 supermarkets captured more than half of US grocery sales. By the 1980s they had \nbecome the dominant food distribution channel in the US. Today Germany, the UK, and France show \nsupermarket shares of food retail at 70-80%. This business model, now refined, has emerged much more \nquickly than that of either the EU or the US, with strong implications for domestic and regional food suppliers. \n \n                                                 \n6 The exporter only contracts for baby corn, a product that is less likely to result in pesticide residues. \n6 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \n \nFigure 2: Growth in Supermarkets on a Regional Basis, 1997\u20132002 \n80000\n71648\n70000\n60000\n54601\n50000\ns\ne\nor\nSt\nof  40000\ner \nb\nm\nu\nN 30000 28663\n18944\n20000\n14913\n12061\n10000\n923 1367 787 2250 848 2861 19 134\n0\nAfrica Asia Pacific Central & Eastern Latin America Middle East North America Western Europe\nEurope\nRegion\n1997 2002\n \nSource: M+M Planet Retail \n \nIt is important to understand the effects of this market transformation, not only on producers \nand  value  chains  but  also  on  the  entire  agrifood  system,  since  it  affects  costs  and \ndistributional issues from the farm to the table. Within these larger trends, several important \ndevelopments can be observed: \n\u2022  Increasing demands for higher levels of farmer performance in quality, process, and \nfinancial capacity to invest in technology and operating capital; \n\u2022  Greater  centralization  of  retail  procurement  with  the  advent  of  the  specialized, \nsophisticated  multi-country  logistics  management  wholesaler  replacing  traditional \nwholesalers;  \n\u2022  Greater  use  of  contracts  and  private  systems  to  identify  and  reward  preferred \nsuppliers. \nThe Asia region now represents barely a third of all of the global food retail sales. It is \nforecast to grow to 41% of the global food retail market by 2020 while Europe will comprise \n30% and the NAFTA area will shrink to 21% (IGD calculations). Multiple store retailers will \nbe an important part of that as they are growing fast throughout the world, particularly with \nthe liberalization of emerging markets and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). These include \nsmall-scale  convenience  stores,  such  as  those  associated  with  gasoline  stations, \nsupermarkets, and full-service retailers such as hypermarkets.  \n7 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nDeveloping countries are not exempt from the trend toward supermarkets.

In \nSoutheast Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, supermarkets have \nalready  captured  an  average  33%  share  of  the  non-fresh  food  retail.  Applying  the \ncalculations of Reardon and others in Latin America, one can estimate that supermarkets\u2019 \nshare of the fresh segment in Asia is approximately half of their total share in packaged \nfoods. \nIn some countries the growth has been even more rapid. Indonesia\u2019s supermarkets\u2019 share of \nfood  retail  was  negligible  before  1998  and  by  2005  reached  about  30%  of  the  total \n(Natawidjaja et al., 2006). In the PRC, where supermarkets did not exist prior to 1990, they \ncontrolled  13%  of  total  food  sales  by  2003,  approximating  the  situation  in  Brazil  and \nArgentina in the early 1990s but with one difference: the PRC is registering growth that is \nthree times greater than Latin American growth rates in the 1990s. According to Hu et al. \n(2004), supermarkets in the PRC are growing faster than in any other nation at 30\u201340% per \nyear. By 2002, supermarket sales in the PRC had already reached $55 billion, up from $10 \nbillion in 1996. Strong growth is likely to continue. IGD predicts that the entire Chinese \ngrocery market will grow by 65% to US$456 billion between 2005 and 2010. \nThe dominance of these new retail formats has resulted in the emergence of demanding \nnew procurement channels and the decline of smaller informal markets that could more \nreadily accept both small quantities and inconsistent qualities of foods from farmers and \nmiddlemen. In Viet Nam and the PRC, as supermarkets develop fast in cities, government \npolicies favor centralization of food distribution and the reduction of street vending and \ninformal markets (Moustier et al., 2005; Reardon, 2005).7  \nThe demands in the domestic markets of less developed nations are growing and are \nincreasingly resembling those of export channels. Latin America, for example, is a primary \nexporter of fruits and vegetables, yet over the last 15 years supermarkets have grown to sell \nabout 3 times more fruits and vegetables than are exported from the region. Reardon et al. \n(2005) and Vander Stichele et al. (2006) also claim that the increasing market domination by \nbig  corporations  and  multinational  supermarket  chains  influences  the  prices  producers \nreceive  and  the  conditions  under  which  they  must  produce.  The  consolidation  of \nprocurement implies great challenges for smaller producers.8 \nSupermarket channels have demanding private standards similar to export requirements for \nsize, color, safety, consistency, volume, packaging, labels, etc., which implies the need for \nproduction level investments in drip irrigation, greenhouses, advanced storage, hygienic \n                                                 \n7 In Viet Nam, for example, the Domestic Trade Department of Hanoi views some street vendors as an \nundesirable influx of the rural and peri-urban poor coming into the city on a daily basis to sell products on the \nstreet, causing congestion, unsightliness, and a waste management problem. \n8 The increasing use of standards and contract systems in the global retailing industry has the potential to restrict \naccess of smallholder producers to these higher-valued chains. In Bangladesh, as an example, Agora \nSupermarkets only had  two branches in 2004. In order to obtain fresh produce they  had contracting \nrelationships with thousands of smallholder vegetable growers. They had planned to open two additional \nbranches in 2005, and then to stop purchasing much of their food locally (within Bangladesh) and instead \nsource everything from overseas. With four branches they believed they would then have enough volume of \nsales to enable them to order by the container load directly from Singapore (sourced from Australia, New \nZealand, and the US). Ultimately, it was easier to deal with one freight forwarder in Singapore than thousands \nof farmers (Purcell and Hassanullah, 2004). \n8 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nservices, and logistics. These effects served to consolidate the many small suppliers to \nThailand's largest supermarket chain, so that only the more professional operators\u2014usually \norganized groups or larger farmers\u2014could continue to trade with it directly (van Roekel et \nal., 2001).  \nMore investment and operating capital are also needed since the greater volume of export \nand supermarket channels often means lower margins and delayed payments from buyers. \nMeanwhile, the traditional middlemen and general wholesalers that provided the framework \nfor moving products from farms to processors and retailers are morphing toward specialized \nprocurers for larger retailers and chains. Consequently, spot and wholesale markets tend to \ndecline in importance and forward contracts expand (Reardon et al., 2003). These contracts \noften involve requirements for much larger and more sophisticated harvest and storage \noperations, centralized distribution systems, and longer shipping distances that create an \nincreasing need for clear standards.  \n III.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS AND THEIR ROLE IN MARKET ACCESS \nThousands of standards or standards-related agreements exist for the agrifood sector. While \nmany are public with common applications, most of today\u2019s agricultural trade standards are \nprivately set by groups or firms and apply primarily to their specific needs. The complex \ndistinctions between process and product characteristics and different types of indirect costs \nassociated with standards can dramatically diminish their benefits and effectively make them \nbarriers to entry (Giovannucci and Ponte, 2005). Standards affect not only producers but \nalso value chains, agribusinesses, and consumers, so it is vital to understand who is forming \nstandards, their motivations, their increasing privatization, and the impacts. \nStandards: Public and Private  \nPublic standards revolving around food safety, consumer protection, and trade facilitation \nare  embodied  primarily  in  government  regulations  and  some  international  codes  and \naccords. The public standards of individual governments are also important. Often they are \nthe primary portal that products must pass through, and they can be both rigorous and \nmandatory. \nPrivate  standards  are  those  imposed  by  buyers  and  usually  require  higher  levels  of \nperformance than the baseline public standards. These can apply to such areas as quality, \nprocess management, packaging requirements, or social concerns. While public standards \nare typically clear and well established, private standards can be more difficult, particularly \nbecause they can be fast-changing. Though sometimes called voluntary, private standards \nare becoming the basic de facto entry requirement for trade with many of the large-scale \noperators and leading value chains.  \nMeeting  private  standards  is  becoming  essential  for  doing  business  in  higher-value \nagriculture.  Among  the  best-known  private  standards  are  those  of  the  International \nStandardization  Organization  (ISO)  series,  HACCP,  Fair  Trade,  Organic,  and  Good \nAgricultural Practices (GAP) adopted by entities such as EUREP or ASEAN. Sometimes \nprivate sector standards like Certified Organic or HACCP are adopted and codified by \ngovernment as regulations.  \nIn addition to the private standards noted above, individual firms are also developing their \nown internal norms that may differ from the current broader sectoral norms. Firms ranging \nfrom Cargill and Unilever to Cadbury, Starbucks, and Nestle all have undertaken such \nefforts. \n9 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nProcess  standards  are  typically  private  in  character  and  typically  refer  to  the  entire \ncultivation,  packaging,  or  manufacturing  process.  These  serve  as  criteria  for  sourcing \ndecisions, and some pay closer attention to the responsible use of agrochemical inputs, \nenergy, water, wastes, and the impact on communities and the environment. In addition to \nwell-known process standards such as GAP, GMP, HACCP, and ISO, the cause-related \nstandards are becoming increasingly popular. Some better-known examples are: \n1.  Organic  \n2.  Fair Trade  \n3.  Ethical Trading Initiative  \n4.  Rainforest Alliance  \n5.  SA-8000  \n6.  UTZ Certified \n \nThese are sometimes referred to as sustainability standards and are unique in that they can \nembody  somewhat  intangible  social  and  environmental  characteristics;  see  Error! \nReference source not found.. Although all are managed by or originate from NGOs, these \nstandards have evolved to become much more public in their objectives, transparency, and \nstandard setting. All are nonprofit,9 and it can be argued that they fulfill a public good while \nfilling a growing consumer demand. \nOrganic  \nOrganic is the fastest-growing sector of the food industry, with global sales doubling since \n2001 and exceeding US$40 billion in 2007.10 High market growth rates are leading to supply \nshortages in some sectors such as fresh produce, meat, dairy, and certain processing \ningredients. The Asia region alone has experienced triple-digit growth in organic farmland \nbetween 2000 and 2006. The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements \n(IFOAM) is the global coordinating body for Organics. \nOrganic standards are among the most misunderstood. They are sometimes considered to \nbe simply the absence of synthetic inputs; however, this is only one aspect of an organic \nsystem.  Organic  agriculture  relies  on  scientific  and  traditional  knowledge  to  work  with \nbiological and mechanical methods to manage ecological systems. It works to optimize \nquality and sustainability while reducing external inputs and synthetic materials. \nSocial issues such as labor rights and conditions are also part of organic principles but not \ncommonly part of certification requirements. General environmental principles are clearly \nembedded in organic principles, but specific guidelines on aspects such as biodiversity are \nnot necessarily part of the certification processes. Organic certification can also apply to \nprocessed food, and in this case most artificial preservatives or additives are avoided. \nFor the purposes of most trade, organic products are third-party certified and include both \ninternal  controls  and  traceability.  However,  for  local  applications,  different  credence \nmechanisms are often utilized that do not depend on formal certification processes. These \nare often lower in cost and can be equally effective (Giovannucci, 2005). \nTable 2: Comparative Overview of Some Popular Process or Sustainability Standards \nFeature  Organic  FairTrade  Rainforest Alliance \nPremium  Premium likely paid  Premium assured  Modest premium often \n                                                 \n9 In some countries organic standards have become public standards by virtue of laws that regulate their \napplication. \n10 Calculation based on historic growth data reported by IFOAM and Organic Monitor \n10 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nespecially if certified - but not  paid but not assured \nassured \nYield and  Short-term impact on yields  Only indirect (and  Potentially negative \nquality  may be negative; possibly  possibly positive) impact  yield impact; possibly \npositive impact on some  of yields and quality due  positive impact on \naspects of quality  to higher income for  some aspects of \ninputs and labor  quality \nOther income  Possibility of selling other  Group collaboration  Possibility of selling \nimpacts  organic products from the  facilitates economies of  forest as well as \ncertified farm; income  scale  agricultural products \ndiversification \nMarket access  Access to well-established  Access to small but well- Buyers and markets \nand reliable market  established market  limited but increasing \nfast with major brands  \nExtension,  Possible extension from  Improved access to trade  Possible agro-forestry \ncredit  supportive NGOs but limited  financing and credit and  extension from \nsupport from public system  improved financial  supportive NGOs, but \nposition of cooperatives  limited support from \npublic system \nSocial impact  Potential increase in mutual  Increased organizational  Through social norms \nand  support among farmers to  capacity of participating \norganizational  solve farming management  farmers; access to \ncapacity   problems  training; community \n  projects \nEnvironmental  Improved soil fertility as well  Limited environmental  Improved biodiversity \nimpact  as resistance to drought and  benefits  and agro-ecological \nerosion; no synthetic  conditions \nagrochemicals  \nRisk, planning  Risk reduction through  Cooperative level  Integrated pest \ncapabilities  reduced external inputs; no  planning; guaranteed  management  \nmono-cropping; soil  price reduces risk \nresilience \nSource: Adapted with modifications from Giovannucci and Ponte (2005). \nEco-friendly or Safe Foods \nA broad range of standards exists that are focused primarily on ecological systems and the \nassurance of agricultural products produced in a manner that avoids toxic chemicals or other \nforms of contamination. Rainforest Alliance standards are among the best known of this \ncategory and are sourced in dozens of countries for sale primarily to the US, Europe, and \nJapan. Some nations have also developed standards. Japan has a government production \nstandard that references ecologically friendly measures as well as food safety and requires \ncertification by an accredited body. In the PRC  \u201cGreen Foods\u201d are government-certified \nproducts are labeled under government supervision as safe from chemical contamination \nwith their production and processing using more environmentally friendly processes. This \nstandard is recognized only in the PRC, but some trading partners in Japan and Europe \nhave accepted it as a substitute assurance for basic food safety measures. In 2003, green \nfood exports topped US$1.5 billion. Other governments including Malaysia and Thailand \nhave developed certifiable standards for agriculture. In India, less formal approaches include \nseveral traditional holistic farming systems based on ancient techniques for soil and animal \nmanagement that eschew synthetic inputs and are in harmony with natural on-farm inputs \nand cycles. These are neither government regulated nor formally certified but are followed in \nmany of the country\u2019s regions and are commonly called either \u201cJaivic Krishi\u201d or \u201cVedic \nKrishi.\u201d  \n11 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nFair Trade \nFair Trade is an alternative to the often asymmetrical buyer/producer negotiations featured in \nconventional trade and aims to improve the livelihoods and well-being of small producers by \nassuring a fair price agreement, continuity in trading relationships, and the strengthening of \nsmall-producer organizations. Fair Trade products are typically sold in more developed \nmarkets  via  an  NGO-operated  certification  system.  Fairtrade  Labelling  Organizations \nInternational (FLO) is the global coordinating body for certified products. Nearly 60 countries \nnow export a variety of certified Fair Trade products and they are sold in more than 50 \ncountries. In 2006, the estimated retail value in these markets was more than \u20ac1.6 billion \nand products were sourced from two dozen developing countries.11 \nCodex \nCodex  Alimentarius  is  an  intergovernmental  body  facilitated  by  the  UN\u2019s  Food  and \nAgriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) that aims to \nprotect consumer health and facilitate international trade in food. For decades its guidelines \nhave been internationally recognized benchmarks for food products and form a basis for \nmany standards, including national standards and those recommended by the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO). For example, it has evaluated hundreds of food additives and common \ncontaminants and set maximum residue limits for approximately 2,500 combinations of \ncommodities and pesticides. \nWhile  certainly  beneficial,  particularly  in  setting  baseline  public  standards  and  the \ndevelopment of many national regulations,12 Codex is a large, consensus-oriented organism \nand is therefore relatively slow to adapt to the needs of day-to-day trade and recommend \ntimely changes.  \nISO  \nThe ISO is a network of national standards institutes from 157 countries and is organized as \nan NGO. Within its objective to facilitate international exchange of goods and services, it \nsets a number of the most popular trade standards and fosters standardization activities. Its \nstandards  are  voluntary  and  typically  codify  sectoral  best  practices.  Although  ISO \ncertification does not refer to the output of the process but only that a process is in place, it is \nperceived as a signal of conscientious management. \nAn increasing number of ISO\u2019s 15,000 standards and guidelines are relevant to producers \nand agrifood enterprises. The 9000 series, the most popular, promotes good management \npractices to ensure the consistent quality and delivery of goods and services. The 14000 \nseries promotes sound environmental management in order to minimize negative effect \ncaused by various productive activities including agricultural processing. \nISO is increasingly writing overview standards that capture trends in agrifood trade, such as \nISO 22000, which is designed for generic food safety,13 and the forthcoming ISO 26000, \nwhich covers voluntary guidance on social responsibility and is slated for publication in 2010. \nISO's importance extends to verification mechanisms in that many governments and private \n                                                 \n11 Based on FLO data, November 2007. \n12 Cambodia has adopted all of the Codex standards\u2014at least on paper. Viet Nam had adopted about 60% of \nCodex standards relating to food and foodstuffs as of 2005 and planned to adopt all remaining ones (MOT and \nEU, 2005). \n13 ISO 22000 is an auditable standard and aligned with Codex\u2019s HACCP but goes farther with requirements for \nfood safety management systems and specific areas such as strengthening prerequisite programs and \ntransforming the recommendations into requirements. ISO 22000 is coming into use, and the US Seafood \nInspection Program (National Marine Fisheries Service) will soon start to audit for compliance with both ISO \n9001 and ISO 22000. \n12 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nfirms insist that certification bodies comply with a standard (ISO65) that is an international \nequivalent and recognized for other rulings such as European Norm EN 45011.14  \nHACCP \nHazard Analysis at Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic analysis for potential \nfood safety risks within, for example, a post-harvest or processing operation. The analysis \ntypically identifies appropriate control and monitoring systems to minimize such risks. It \nassures that such a management approach has been established but not whether it is used \nor how effectively.  \n \nIt is most often used with higher-risk foods, such as poultry, livestock, and fish products. \nTypically, HACCP reduces food contamination risk in two ways:  \n1.  Anticipates potential problems or failures before they happen and does not depend \nonly on a final   inspection;  \n2.  There is a greater likelihood of resolving the problem during process rather than at \nthe end of the process or once the product moves into the supply chain or market. \nConsequently, HACCP can also yield cost savings in terms of reduced waste, reprocessing, \nor recalls.  \nGAP and GMP \nThe more recent ASEAN GAP standard is adapted to Asia-Pacific conditions and has many \nsimilarities to EUREP-GAP (known as Global-GAP as of September 2007). These standards \nare widely used by many companies, especially by firms that export to Europe. They are \nbased on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) that promote basic food safety principles to \nminimize  biological,  chemical,  and  physical  hazards  associated  with  crops  from  seed \nthrough harvest storage.15  \nGood Manufacturing Practices (GMP) begin from the harvest and storage stage and serve to \nguide the people working in contact with food, its packaging materials, and work environs to \nconform to basic sanitation and hygiene practices to protect against food contamination from \nboth direct or indirect sources. These standards also typically improve worker safety. \nWTO Access and the Role of SPS and TBT Agreements  \nThe public or governmental application of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) or technical \nmeasures can act as standards and have a growing impact on the nature and direction of \ninternational trade controls. Although part of the WTO for some time, the SPS and Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) agreements are increasingly important ways to manage trade in light \nof the diminution of tariffs, quotas, and other formal measures. For example, Environmental \nand Related Health Requirements\u2014provisions for which are contained in both the SPS and \nTBT agreements\u2014have nearly doubled (rising from 10% to 18%) as a percentage of WTO \nnotifications since the early 1990s (UNCTAD, 2006).  \nSPS measures are intended to ensure human food safety and protect agricultural plant and \nanimal populations and ecosystems. Each country sets food safety and animal and plant \n                                                 \n14 Similarly, ISO 61 is the recognized guideline for accreditation bodies and is often the benchmark for national \nrulings on this (e.g., The European EN 45010). ISO 62 covers quality system certifiers. \n15 They  specifically  address  the  following  topics:  site  selection;  adjacent  land  use;  water;  fertilizers; \nherbicides/pesticides; hygiene; field, facility, and worker hygiene; product cooling; and transportation.   \n13 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nhealth  standards  based  on  its  own  assessment  of  acceptable  risk  levels.  The  SPS \nagreement recognizes the right of countries to maintain national standards that are stricter \nthan international levels, although they must be justified by scientific evidence and should be \nconsistently applied. \nThe TBT agreement aims to stop WTO members from using arbitrary technical regulations, \nstandards, or testing and certification procedures to protect domestic producers. It applies to \nall  aspects  of  food  standards  not  covered  by  the  SPS  agreement,  including  labeling \nrequirements, nutrition claims, and quality and packaging regulations, which are generally \nnot considered as either sanitary or phytosanitary measures. TBT prevents members from \ndistinguishing between goods on the basis of either production or processing methods but \nspecifies  conditions  when  members  may  restrict  trade  using  technical  regulations  or \nstandards. \nThe  WTO  recognizes  three  organizations  as  sources  of  internationally  agreed-upon \nbenchmark agrifood standards that can affect SPS and TBT: the Codex Alimentarius, the \nOffice International des Epizooties (known as OIE) for animal health, and the International \nPlant  Protection  Convention  (IPPC)  for  plant  health.  The  OIE  is  an  83-year-old \nintergovernmental organization that analyzes and disseminates veterinary information to \nprovide expertise and transparency in control of global animal disease (includes aquatic). \nThe  IPPC  is  a  standards  treaty  that  aggregates  19  approved  international  standards, \nestablishing measures to prevent the introduction and spread of plant pathogens and pests. \nIts Secretariat is within FAO, but it works through National and Regional Plant Protection \nOrganizations such as the Asia and Pacific Plant Protection Commission or the European \nand  Mediterranean  Plant  Protection  Organization  to  help  countries  meet  their  IPPC \nobligations.  \nHarmonizing Standards \nEfforts have been made to develop more coherent meta-standards, particularly for food \nsafety. Theoretically at least, they would permit the rapid movement of foods from country to \ncountry and facilitate the learning process of producers and processors when they are \nmeeting only one general standard. Understandably, these efforts would raise issues of \ndomestic impact in each country, particularly in poorer nations. The International Committee \nof Food Retail Chains (CIES) Global Food Safety Initiative is one harmonization effort to \nprovide a single set of rules for standards. The International Social and Environmental \nAccreditation  and  Labeling  (ISEAL)  organization  also  strives  to  achieve  harmonization \namong some of the most important eco-social standards bodies including IFOAM, Rainforest \nAlliance, FLO, UTZ Certified, and the Forest Stewardship Council. Their efforts can provide \nuseful stepping stones for countries to collectively adopt standards guidelines and training \nframeworks  that  have  broad-scale  relevance  and  can  reduce  the  individual  cost  of \ncompliance. \nIV.  THE CURRENT CAPACITY TO MEET EMERGING MARKET REQUIREMENTS  \nThe Challenge \nStandards are difficult for many developing-country farmers to achieve, yet they provide \nunique market opportunities. By meeting certain standards, farmers can reduce the risk of \nrejection in the marketplace as well as access new, more profitable market segments. Since \nstandards  set  some  producers  apart,  the  differentiation  they  represent  serves  as  a \ncompetitive tool. Clearly, SMEs and smaller farms in developing countries face challenges in \nmeeting them. Many struggle to learn and apply these new expectations, and evidence is \nbuilding that if they cannot achieve at least basic standards they risk being excluded from \ncompetitive  markets  both  regionally  and  internationally  with  potentially  serious \n14 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nconsequences for economic growth, poverty alleviation, and even food security (Vander \nStichele et al., 2006; Moustier et al., 2005; Reardon et al., 2003). Most producers face \ncommon barriers when considering standards:  \n1.  Selecting  which  among  the  standards  requires  a  good  measure  of  market \nintelligence and contact with buyers as well as experience in assessing the relative \ndemands, costs, and benefits of each\u2014something  for which there is almost no data \nwhatsoever; \n2.  Few institutions exist to facilitate the adoption of standards as an ongoing learning \nprocess that takes both time and consistent training; \n3.  Capital  to  invest  in  new  processes,  equipment,  and  infrastructure  is  difficult  to \naccess; \n4.  Transaction costs for certifying products can be high and a barrier to entry; \n5.  Risky learning is often done at an international level since local market demand is \nmodest. \nMany  processors,  exporters,  and  retailers\u2014especially  for  higher-value  products\u2014favor \nproducers  that  can  meet  their  demands  for  standards,  large  volumes,  and  year-round \nconsistency. They sometimes create their own collection or purchasing systems that bypass \nlocal market networks thus reducing access. Typically this forces small- and medium-sized \nsuppliers to either consolidate into organizations or larger firms or to compete for the lower-\nvalue  channels that remain. Three quick-sketch case studies point to the positive and \nnegative experiences of different approaches; see Box 2, Box 3, Box 4. \nBox 2:Thailand Case Study\nA value chain analysis was carried out on Tops Supermarket group, a dominant food retailer in \nThailand. The study noted: \n\u2022  Variability of prices due to high losses from inadequate storage and refrigerated transport. \n\u2022  Slow order response time from poor production methods, planning, and information flow.  \n\u2022  Inability to meet product specifications because of inadequate quality controls. \n\u2022  Coordination difficulties among small suppliers.  \n\u2022  Lack of trust and cooperation among participants in the value chain. \n \nTops Supermarket had a number of specific requirements for perishables that were not being met by \nits existing supply structure. When Tops insisted that its suppliers be certified under the Ministry of \nAgriculture\u2019s new food safety program, most were unable to comply, and 190 of the 250 current \nsuppliers were eliminated (Boselie, 2002). Most smallholders had difficulties meeting the conditions so \nonly a few could continue and only by organizing as a group of second- or third-tier suppliers and \nsubcontracting to the larger preferred suppliers that had the capacity and could afford the investments \nnecessary to directly contract with World Fresh Distribution Center (van Roekel et al., 2001). \n \nThis case demonstrates that competitive requirements served to eliminate smaller-scale participants. \nIn this instance, public-private cooperation led to overcoming the problems for some of the more able \nparticipants. However, the lack of appropriate institutional structure and the explicit intent to integrate \na broader group of suppliers effectively led to the exclusion of many.  \nBox 3: People\u2019s Republic of China Case Study \nUnder different organizational models small producers have demonstrated a notable ability to meet \nvery high quality standards and even achieve international certification. In the towns of the Feicheng \narea of the PRC's Shandong Province, local government committees have provided the institutional \nframework to organize large-scale value chains that feed processing companies in the region. Several \ncompanies are involved, and one of these, the Tai\u2019an Asia Food Co., is a Sino-Japanese joint venture \nthat receives the production of approximately 10,600 farmers. Farmers typically earn several hundred \n15 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nUS dollars annually, a remarkable sum considering that their average farm size is less than 0.1 ha.  \n \nFeicheng specializes in high-value organic produce for overseas markets and is somewhat unique in \nthat much of it is reclaimed land that was rendered toxic from excessive chemical use. The area \nproduces 20 kinds of internationally certified horticulture crops with annual production volume of \napproximately 130,000 tons.   \n \nWith government acting as a catalyst, the processors, local input, transport, training enterprises, and \nfarm communities have developed relations reminiscent of Porter\u2019s cluster model.16 The interface \nbetween farmers and the large enterprises is often mediated by local government, which provides a \ntailored framework to support the farmers\u2019 participation. It involves training, certification, extension \nservices, and the facilitating of input distribution where necessary.  \n \nThe critical lessons derived here revolved around having access to sufficient and consistent training, \nespecially during the conversion phase when many producers were unfamiliar with the new \nrequirements. A steadfast, reliable institutional structure, e.g., local government, facilitated the \nproducers' willingness to adopt new methods and substantially reduced their risk. Equally important \nwas the presence of a dependable value chain that ensured access to lucrative markets. \nSource: Original case study conducted for Giovannucci (2005).  \nBox 4: Indonesia Case Study \nFor most Indonesian consumers, fresh fruit and vegetables (FFV) are taking on an increasing share of \ntheir total food expenses. This is especially true in urban areas where supermarket channels are \ncapturing an increasingly greater share of the business, but much of the business does not involve \nIndonesian producers.  \n \nNatawidjaja et al. (2006) found that nearly all retailers prefer to purchase imported FFV products \nrather than deal with Indonesian farmers due to inadequate value chains, missing or low-quality \ninfrastructure, and poor standards. A striking 60% of the FFV sold by supermarkets are imported \n(approximately 80% of the fruit and 20% of the vegetables). This is considerably higher than the figure \nin other comparable developing countries. Larger retailers source directly from large-scale importers, \nwhile specialized wholesalers are making inroads by focusing on supplying the demanding needs of \nmodern food industry channels such as fast-food chains and restaurants, institutional users, and \nsupermarkets. \n \nIn West Java, the most prolific FFV production area, farmers typically lack capital and self-\norganization to produce according to requirements of supermarkets. Some specialized or dedicated \nwholesalers are increasingly working with small farmers but not more than 15% in any area. \n \nThe notable lack of support services and institutional and physical infrastructure leads wholesalers \nand farmers to perceive the new FFV markets as a very difficult challenge met only by the most \ncapitalized and capable. This makes most Indonesian FFV farmers essentially uncompetitive in their \ndomestic consumer markets.  \nInadequate Standards and Forsaken Value \nLu (2005) estimates that in 2004 alone the PRC experienced approximately $8 billion in \nreduced exports due to its failure to meet standards in numerous agricultural subsectors. \nThis has happened in almost every sector, including grains, apiculture products, livestock, \nfungi, and fruits and vegetables. For example, the prohibition of Chinese animal products to \nthe EU in 2002 caused a $623 million loss for 94 Chinese food-processing enterprises. In \n2002 and 2003, the PRC's export value of frozen spinach to Japan decreased by $372 \nmillion compared to that of two years prior due to rejections for agrochemical residues. Even \nthe US faced problems with standards when an E.coli outbreak leading to three deaths in \n                                                 \n16 Michael Porter\u2019s cluster theory is useful for understanding the nature of complementary and sometimes \ncompetitive enterprises grouping in a region for mutual benefit. See, for example, Porter (1980). \n16 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nmid-2006 resulted in expected losses for the US spinach industry17 reaching $100 million for \nthe year.  \nThe recent discovery in Europe of illegal, genetically modified rice from the PRC prompted \nthe  European  Commission  to  discuss  far-reaching  import  restrictions  that  would  affect \nnumerous rice farmers. This would apply also to non-GMO farmers from affected areas, in \neffect burdening them for the standards compliance failure of their compatriots. It is not just \nthe  inability  to  meet  food  safety  standards  that  diminishes  potential  income.  Coffee \nproducers in Cambodia and Laos, lacking technology and processing infrastructure, often \ncannot meet the basic quality requirements of international markets, and their production is \nnow limited to domestic markets and some proximate cross-border trade.  \nSimilarly, Viet Nam\u2019s prodigious coffee trade is second to rice as the largest agricultural \nexport  earner  and  directly  employs  600,000  workers.  Much  of  the  production  quality, \nhowever, is such that its exports have consistently earned less per pound FOB than any of \nthe top ten producers between 1993 and 2003 (ICO statistics).  \nThe EU is Bangladesh\u2019s most important client for its fourth-leading export: frozen shrimp and \nfish. In 1997 the EU banned Bangladeshi fishery products due to inspections that found \nserious infrastructure and hygiene deficiencies in processing establishments and insufficient \nquality control guarantees by government inspectors. Cato and Subasinge (2003) note that, \nin  just  five  months  that  year,  the  revenues  lost  (US$15  million)  nearly  equaled  the \ninvestment  required  to  upgrade  those  plants  and  train  personnel  (US$18  million).  The \nimpact, both reputational and monetary, on the industry and economy of Bangladesh was \nsubstantial. \nImplications for Producers   \nCurrently, increased standards primarily impact those dealing with larger buyers or with the \nmarket for higher-value products. The developments in several countries noted previously \nindicate this will eventually be part of the equation for more buyers and for a broader range \nof products, even in secondary markets. Opportunities exist to better understand and adapt \nto new standards requirements in the secondary and regional markets in order to be better \nprepared  for  the  eventual  growing  demands  of  those  markets  as  well  as  to  export \ncompetitively to the most lucrative markets.  \nFor producers to be competitive and have market access, they have to address eight \ndevelopment areas: \n1.  Institutional  structures  \u2013  to  deliver  localized  production  training  and  farm  and \norganizational management;  \n2.  Market intelligence \u2013 understanding what to produce, at what time, and according to \nwhat standards in order to meet buyer specifications; \n3.  Quality \u2013 better inputs, particularly high-quality seed and appropriate varietals, for \nmarket-oriented  production  and  capital  investment  for  harvest  and  post-harvest \nrequirements;  \n4.  Quantity \u2013 group organization for smaller producers to aggregate the necessary \nvolumes; \n                                                 \n17 http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/10/26/spinach.fears.ap/index.html \n17 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \n5.  Consistent  supply  \u2013  appropriate  late-  and  early-season  varietals  as  well  as \ninvestment in greenhouse production;  \n6.  Trade  transactions  \u2013  sound  contract  law  that  is  accessible  with  simple  dispute \nresolution mechanisms; \n7.  Certification \u2013 low-cost certification and efficient product testing services;  \n8.  Trade  financing  \u2013  contract  farming  and  other  internal  value  chain  financing  are \nimportant but will likely be insufficient. \nEnforcing  standards  without  adequate  incentives  is  difficult.  IFAD  research  evaluating \norganics  in  Asia  (Giovannucci,  2005)  found  that  some  aspects  of  standards  may  be \nbypassed where producers gain little benefit from compliance, especially where compliance \nis not easily checked at the farm gate. In the case of arabica coffee, Varangis et al. (2003) \nfound  that  where  farmer  production  was  blended  together  by  traders,  thereby  losing \nindividual product identification, there was little or no reward for compliance or higher-quality \nand minimal penalty for non-compliance. Accordingly, the overall quality suffered as few \nfarmers complied with the established standards. \nV.  COSTS AND BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE STANDARDS AND THE \nROLE OF CONTRACTS  \nClearly, standards are a risk management tool, particularly for buyers that want to ensure the \nquality and safety of their supply. The demand for standards is being pushed increasingly \nupstream in value chains toward producers as a result both of government initiatives and \nprivate sector demands. When producers or processors can meet the required standards, \nthey naturally improve their market access. In some cases producers may also enjoy other \ndirect benefits and costs. \nBenefits: \n\u2022  Improvement in operational and managerial efficiency; \n\u2022  Greater participation in global supply chain and high-value products; \n\u2022  Environmental benefits of erosion reduction and soil improvement; \n\u2022  Health benefits; \n\u2022  Food security, including that of the rural poor (small farmers); \n\u2022  Economic benefit: price premiums. \nCosts: \n\u2022  Transition difficulties potentially affecting yields; \n\u2022  Investments in time and learning; \n\u2022  Financial investment for infrastructure and technology; \n\u2022  Higher operating costs for more complex processes. \n18 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nBenefits: Direct and Indirect  \nIn some cases, implementing standards can improve operational and managerial efficiency. \nFor example, the requirement to keep good records of farm inputs and their application can \nfacilitate internal costs and benefits analysis and improve future planning. Giovannucci in \nAsia (2005) and Damiani in Latin America (2003) found that when small-scale traditional \nproducers shifted to organic standards, they incurred additional costs but generally enjoyed \nlong-term yield improvements and profitability due primarily to better farm management \npractices and price premiums. The results among intensive producers were mixed, with \nsome resulting  in  net economic  benefits  and  others  resulting  in  few, if  any,  economic \nbenefits (Giovannucci, 2005; Giovannucci, 2006). \nSome standards\u2014particularly those that require independent certification\u2014intrinsically fulfill \nmany of the broader requirements for producers to participate in global supply chains or \ncompete in high-value products. For example, detailed recordkeeping of production inputs, \ntraceability, and third-party monitoring that are part of organics are also useful to improve \nchain competitiveness and more effectively participate in lucrative markets.  \nSustainability-oriented standards appear to have some additional benefits for farmers. For \nexample, several recommend diversification away from dependence on a single cash crop, \nthereby  reducing  a  producer\u2019s  risk  of  crop  failure.  Pretty  et  al.  (2005)  reviewed  286 \nagricultural project interventions in 57 poor countries and noted that the application of \nimproved  environmental  standards  (IPM,  organics,  LEISA, 18  etc.)  not  only  generally \nimproved  the  supply  of  critical  environmental  services  for  the  communities  but  also \nincreased  productivity  on  most  of  the  12.6  million  farms  covered.  Several  standards \nincluding GAP offer environmental benefits; studies have shown that these can reduce \nerosion and improve soil quality (FAO, 2002; Mader et al., 2002).  \nFood security is of particular concern in areas of rural poverty. By fostering agricultural \nmethods that improve not only the soil\u2019s natural fertility but also its ability to withstand natural \ncalamities such as drought (Altieri, 1999; Drinkwater, Wagoner, and Sarrantonio, 1998) and \nmore efficiently use nutrients (M\u00e4der et al., 2002), the likelihood of food shortages can be \nreduced. Setboonsarng (2006) notes several studies showing farmers that meet organic \nstandards enjoy a number of advantages. For example, lower production costs can improve \nfarm viability while diversification reduces the likelihood of catastrophic crop failure, and \necological management of local resources further contributes to local food security. \nIncreasingly,  sustainability  concerns  are  emerging  in  many  private  standards  such  as \nGlobal-GAP and ISO. These may have some reference to the considerations of Organic, \nFair Trade, or eco-friendly approaches while remaining simpler and less demanding. In most \ncases,  meeting  standards  such  as  Organics  means  producers  are  able  to  meet  the \nenvironmental requirements of many, though not necessarily all, other standards.. Bartram \nand  Perkins  (2003)  reviewed  33  published  studies  and  concluded  that  substantial \nbiodiversity advantages existed when organic standards were applied. The field-to-table \ntraceability, animal management requirements, and restrictions on the use of agrochemicals \nprovide reasonable assurances of increased farmer safety, food safety, and animal health. \nThe importance of farm-level diversification and a price premium for the required processes \nand certification further help to ensure a measure of economic benefit.  \nBesides the clear economic value of market access, the evidence for direct economic \nreturns resulting from the application of standards is less clear. In many cases, meeting a \nstandard is not associated with a higher or premium price; it is simply a requirement for \ndoing business in any high-value product. In commodities and lower-value products, the \n                                                 \n18 Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture \n19 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nfailure to meet standards is likely to result in a lower price. This is the case for most GAP or \nGMP standards and all food safety standards. The research on the actual costs and benefits \nincurred in the adoption of standards is rather limited, although some attempts are currently \nbeing undertaken, the foremost being the Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA) \nmeasuring both direct and indirect costs and benefits of the major sustainability standards at \nnot only the economic level, but the social and environmental levels as well.19 \nIt is hard to tell the extent to which a price premium is paid for achieving a standard or for \nmeeting a quality level since many products also have some physical or organoleptic quality \nrequirements and the reasons for payment are often not distinguished. In some cases a \nprice premium is clearly associated with the achievement and maintenance of a particular \ncertification;  this  happens  most  often  with  the  more  complex  and  demanding  process \nstandards related to sustainability such as Organic and Fair Trade.  \nFor products that are Fair Trade certified, typically a minimum price agreement exists that is \nconsidered a fair living wage for the producer. Organic product certifications can require \nconsiderable transition costs, recordkeeping, and traceability that elicit a price premium. \nSimilarly, eco-friendly standards such as Rainforest Alliance\u2019s are seen as an opportunity \ncost for producers electing to maintain biodiversity and environmental integrity; these too \nusually  command  a  price  premium.  UTZ  Certified  currently  commands  a  very  modest \npremium though it is too early to tell if that will change for this fast-growing standard as it \ncovers new crops beyond coffee. Ethical trade standards employed in several countries \nhave  resulted  in  improved  market  access  but  no  clear  indication  of  consistent  market \npremiums. Conversely, when products fail to meet basic standards, they are likely to face a \nprice penalty. \nCosts: Direct and Indirect  \nSeveral types of costs typically are involved in the adoption of standards. First, a learning \ncurve can require a large and prolonged time investment. This can also require sometimes \ncostly institutional support from a producer organization, community, government agent, or \nNGO.  Confusion  about  the  types  of  standards  and  their  specific  requirements  is  an \nintangible cost. Little research has been conducted on these costs. Second, investment is \nsometimes required in equipment or infrastructure to meet standards. Third, the need for \nindependent verification or certification for compliance and traceability also involves an \nexpense. Traceability through the chain is increasingly relevant and challenging particularly \nin  critical  situations,  e.g.,  positive  residue  tests,  false  or  fraudulent  declarations,  or \ndiscrepancies in quantities traded. While direct certification costs are relatively simple to \nmeasure, it is difficult to categorize other typical costs of adopting standards since they \ndepend heavily on two broad-ranging variables: the requirements of a specific standard and \nthe producer\u2019s or processor\u2019s current ability to meet that standard.  \nAdopting some standards involves a relatively modest change. In other cases, the transition \ncan take years and a prolonged investment before costs are recouped. Without reliable \nmarket access, the often-higher operating costs of a new standard can be onerous.  \nStandards are not necessarily exclusionary for small producers. Some that are oriented \ntoward  sustainability  can  sometimes  provide  an  advantage  for  smaller  producers.  The \ntypically  more  localized  and  labor-intensive  aspect  of  organic  standards  mostly  lend \nthemselves better to smallholders. Fair Trade standards are designed specifically for small \nproducers and laborers. \n                                                 \n19 www.iisd.org/standards/cosa.asp \n20 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nStandards can have unintended consequences\u2014and considerable costs\u2014for producers as \nwell as entire agricultural subsectors. For example, the lack of credible public food safety \nstandards in Bangladesh caused the poultry products market to drop by 75% for nearly a \nyear after bird flu was found in Southeast Asia even though not a single case was reported \nin Bangladesh.  \nStandards can impose unexpected and unremunerated costs at the local level. In Southeast \nAsian banana plantations, Dardaine (2003) notes that buyers insist that workers wear gloves \nand masks while spraying at the packing station where temperatures can reach 40\u00b0C yet will \nnot increase the price paid for a box of bananas to cover such costs. Some emerging coffee \nstandards piloted by some of the world\u2019s largest coffee companies to improve sustainable \nfield practices present an interesting case study. The International Coffee Organization \n(2004)  noted  that  such  standards  risk  becoming  a  barrier  to  entry  since  they  impose \nrequirements  that  producers  themselves  have  to  finance  in  order  to  participate.  The \nembedded  environmental  and  social  practices  may  be  useful  and  improve  farm \nmanagement, but when imposed on smaller farms without the capital or skills to affect the \nchanges, they can negatively impact the very sustainability that they propose to support.  \nA number of nations have guidelines and laws for the growing or importation of genetically \nmodified organisms (GMOs), and these present a unique challenge.  Unlike a standard that \ncan be met gradually or eventually, GMO contamination of non-GMO crops may be more \npermanent and is not something that producers can readily alter. The potential for genetic \ndrift is causing trade problems for some producers and countries such as the US and \nCanada when after industry assurances of containment capability, a number of food crops \nand storage facilities were discovered to contain GMOs. The EU has already imposed \nsystematic order inspections in August 2006 as an emergency measure after the discovery \nof illegal, genetically modified rice from the PRC.  \nStandards can provide opportunities for increasing sustainable production and improving \nquality and overall competitiveness. The application of standards, however, is a difficult \nadjustment for many farmers faced with reduced extension services, inadequate information, \nand outdated capacities. The application of private grades and standards could inadvertently \nlead to the consolidation of producers, largely eliminating smallholders and the poor from the \nvalue chain. A number of countries are now supporting initiatives to develop largely private-\nsector-based tools such as contract farming to better deal with this challenge. \nThe Role of Contracts in Agricultural Trade Standards \nContract farming is a way to enable small and medium producers to access the benefits of \nstandards. Using contractual arrangements, agro-industry can assist some farm families to \nshift from traditional agriculture to production of higher-value products (Patrick, 2003). This \nmay  potentially  increase  incomes  of  contracting  smallholders,  reduce  risks,  and  have \nmultiplier effects in the rural economy.  \nIn the context of agriculture, Sykuta and Parcell (2002) explain that a contract codifies the \nrules  of  transactions  through  three  key  elements:  value,  risk,  and  decision  rights.  A \nsuccessful contract allocates value, risk, and decisions in a way that is mutually beneficial, \nideally sharing risk and improving quality and production (MMWBP, 2005). As such it can \nassign roles in meeting standards and other difficult demands of modern agrifood trading \nsystems.  \nGenerally the buyer selects standards and transmits this condition up the value chain. Small \nproducers may be unfamiliar with the requirements of standards and unable to access the \nnecessary technology or equipment. Then a contractor can more readily serve as a conduit \nfor providing such requirements, and producers are relieved of finding the right product or \n21 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \ntechnology  and  financing  its  initial  purchase.  Since  producers  rarely  visit  the  terminal \nmarkets for their products, they may not be fully aware of specific requirements. In several \nsouthern African nations, one processing and exporting firm was able to enter a market \ndominated by European producers when it expanded its extension services to local farmers, \nusing technology to help them understand and achieve the desired color range for peppers \nthat were to be exported as paprika (van Gent, 2005; Giovannucci et al., 2001).  \nContract farming can also improve market access especially for smaller producers. As \ncontractors work with farmers to ensure that standards are met, they also aggregate supply \nand  provide  the  necessary  packaging,  transportation,  and  transaction  requirements  to \nenable sales and higher-value markets. For example, a large commercial horticultural firm in \nZambia  helps  smallholder  farmers  sell  EUREPGAP  certified  vegetables  to  Europe  by \nproviding them access to the firm\u2019s own packing plant and airfreight quotas (Purcell and van \nGent, 2005). \nA certain balance of power between participants in the value-chain is necessary to facilitate \nsound relationships, and unless farms are quite large or well organized, this requires the \npresence of viable institutional structures. Poulton et al. (2004) noted in the case of Africa \nthat contracts were more successful where there was neither monopsony buyer power nor \nperfect competition among buyers (MMWBP, 2005). As an example, in Viet Nam, contract \nfarming of undifferentiated products such as ordinary rice has not succeeded as it has with \nspecialty products such as organic aromatic rice, because side-selling is more difficult for \nspecialty products (MMWBP, 2007). \nIn Viet Nam, the enactment of Decision 80 in 2002 attempted to increase the use of \ncontracts to improve procurement and efficiency in the rural economy. The government has \ntried to provide incentives for parties to engage in contracts by providing favorable access to \nfinance, land, and infrastructure. However, contracts under Decision 80 have largely been \nunsuccessful to date. Nguyen Do Anh Tuan et al. (2004) and Tran Cong Thang et al. (2004) \nsuggest that three main issues have compromised such contracts. First, farmers have been \naccused of reneging on contracts when higher prices are offered from traders. Second, \nwhen buyers are faced with oversupplies of products from contracted producers, quality \nstandards  are  sometimes  tightened  so  processors  can  reject  unwanted  output.  Third, \nknowledge of contractual obligations by parties in the contract is often lacking (MMWBP, \n2005). \nFor contracts to be successfully used in many Asian countries, several areas will need to be \nimproved. First, a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach toward contracts may hurt, rather than help, \nproducers and buyers. Second, the limited organization of producers and the imbalance in \nmarket relationships that are not addressed by institutions lead to failures. Third, greater \nknowledge is required in both the public and private sector to educate those engaged in \ncontracts on the nature of contractual obligations and to develop enforcement mechanisms \n(formal or informal) that improve the governance of contracting relationships. Combined, \nthese issues suggest both greater public sector roles and also greater strengthening and \ntightening of the value-chain through improved private-sector organization. Without such \nmeasures, the poor are unlikely to benefit from their participation in contracting relationships \nto raise quality and improve production practices (MMWBP, 2005).   \nVI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \nSynthesis  \nStandards are increasingly critical for global trade competitiveness and becoming more \ndecisive at the domestic level in less developed countries. Trends indicate that even for \ndomestic markets,  standards will  increasingly represent  the rules of the game. This is \n22 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nespecially true for higher-value and perishable products including fruit, vegetables, seafood, \ndairy, and meat products. Standards, like the markets they serve, are dynamic and rapidly \nevolving. They pose very substantial challenges, especially for smaller producers. Yet, within \nthe challenge of standards there are a host of opportunities. \nAs Hoffman notes,20 governments should look beyond the immediate costs to the prospects \nand  the  catalytic  role  that  standards  offer  both  for  national  competitiveness  and \nenvironmental sustainability. For developing countries, these standards provide competitive \noptions with higher-value products, especially sustainability standards such as organics \nwhose process management and traceability can aid market entry and whose application \nmethods are well suited to small-farm conditions.  \nThe public sectors in most developing countries often lack know-how in this area, and their \ncapacity to provide extension services and marketing support has further diminished in \nrecent decades. A measure of public support, often with private partnerships, i.e., contract \nfarming, semi-private extension, etc., is vital to ensure efficient and affordable participation \nfor small and medium farmers or rural enterprises. Given the unique nature of standards, an \ninnovative response will be necessary in order for government to be effective. Two issues \nare predominant:  \n1.  Information and capacity building to help producers, firms, and traders compete;  \n2.  Institutional structures to enable the majority of farmers and SMEs to invest and \nparticipate. \nPolicy Focus \nVan Gelder et al. (2006) note that \u201cPolicies on food safety often lead to standards that \ncannot be met by southern countries\u201d and that a program to build capacity is necessary to \nmeet standards. The World Bank, formulating its rural strategy in 2003, acknowledged how \nmarket trends require a new focus on knowledge, value chains, and sustainability that align \nwith the inevitable standards needed for higher-value crops, sustainable production systems, \nand  chains.  This  change  in  emphasis  reflects  a  similar  policy  focus  in  many  of  its \nprogressive client countries. \nPolicies \nPolicies play a big role, and particularly those that influence distributional outcomes will \ncontribute to competitiveness in the long run as small and medium rural entrepreneurs \ndevelop  and  advance  the  sector.  For  example,  for  small  and  medium  producers  to \nparticipate in the livestock sector requires coordinated taxation policy between producers \nand their contractors. In this sector, inputs (primarily feed) can represent three-fourths of the \ncost of production (FAO), and many nations tax market transactions between the contractors \n(feed and input suppliers) and producers who raise the animals. In contrast, most nations do \nnot  tax  the  grain  transfers  within  integrated  operations.  Taxing  transactions  with  small \nproducers not only is a relatively modest source of government revenue but also creates a \ndisincentive for working with such out-growers, giving larger, vertically coordinated firms a \ndistinct advantage.  \nIt can be difficult to determine which standards to select for development training. Some \nstandards are highly specific to a subsector or desired in a particular market. However, \n                                                 \n20 Ulrich Hoffmann, Chief, UNCTAD Trade and Sustainable Development Section, address to plenary conference \non Trade and Environment Dimensions in the Food and Food Processing Industries in Asia and the Pacific \n(16-18 October 2006). \n23 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nnumerous basic standards are relevant across both sectors and markets and are therefore \nthe most useful starting points. For example, integrating GAP practices into basic production \nmethods can provide a measure of basic production sustainability and also the baseline \nrequirement for many other field standards. Subsequent interventions would likely progress \ntoward  more  sophisticated  standards  such  as  organics  that  can  have  broader  local \nenvironmental impacts and international market relevance  \nPublic and Private Roles  \nPublic  and  private  roles  around  the  issue  of  standards  are  intimately  intertwined  and \ncomplementary. At some levels the public sector is intrinsically too slow to be an effective \narbiter or facilitator of the many increasingly important private standards. The private sector \ntoo has its limitations, primarily the failure to adequately address the public concerns for food \nsafety and value chain equity. Still, some useful distinctions exist between private and public \nsector responses to changes in technical standards.  \nOn the whole, the public sector in many developing countries appears unprepared to handle \nthe new norms, since public formulation and enforcement of standards have been relatively \nweak or even absent. This is important since even the slow-to-change public standards, \nsuch as Minimum Residue Levels, are progressively more demanding. A clear concern \nexists about the possible use of public standards as a non-tariff trade barrier. Even if they \ncan be  met,  the  high  compliance  costs  imply  the  possible  erosion  of  the  comparative \nproduction advantages in developing countries. \nPrivate standards are often developed at the firm level.21 The expansion and proliferation of \nthese standards  can  generate  particularly  onerous  transaction  costs  for producers  and \nSMEs. Small farms typically face higher compliance costs than larger ones as they are more \nlikely to lack internal control systems, technical capacity, and investment capital. Therefore, \nif they do not either participate in proactive value chains or have a measure of institutional \nsupport, they may essentially end up producing less-tradeable goods.  \nAccordingly, dealing with standards requires new, more agile institutional frameworks than \ntraditional  methods.  As  such,  innovative  institutional  structures  can  equitably  link \ninternational capacity to local needs. A better collaboration with value chains via practical \nstructures such as contract farming will help ensure competitiveness and inclusion of SMEs \nand smaller farmers. Consequently, it is imperative for government to take the lead in \ncreating an enabling environment to meet three objectives:  \n1.  Knowledge  management  infrastructure  to  both  distill  information  and  provide \naccess to it; \n2.  Business development strategies that integrate with the private sector to ensure \nstandards relevance; \n3.  Institutional structures oriented to producers but also encompassing the entire \nchain to guarantee both equity and long-term competitiveness. \n \nThe recent ubiquitousness of standards and new value-chain models present a unique \nopportunity to learn and develop appropriate interventions that spur the competitiveness of \ninputs, production, processing, and marketing. \n                                                 \n21 Trade associations also create standards in their role as proxies for private firms. \n24 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \n1.  Knowledge management  \nKnowledge management systems are vital to aid awareness and understanding of the \ndrivers, threats, and opportunities implicit in the relevant and forthcoming standards. This \nincludes dedicated, locally accessible knowledge platforms so that producers, SMEs, and \nvalue chains can better understand emerging market trends in different areas, differences \nbetween standards, and implications of adopting particular ones. For example, the work of \nthe Sustainable Commodity Initiative's Committee on Sustainability Assessments (COSA) \nprovides institutions with a detailed grasp of producers\u2019 full costs and benefits involved in \nadopting diverse sustainability standards and initiatives. \nAlthough standards are dynamic and changing, their basic premises are consistent and can \nbe  conveyed  in  a  variety of  teaching  forms,  which  range  from farmer  field  schools  to \ninfluencing the curricula of Technical and Vocational Training schools in order to enhance \nthe skills of farmers and extension agents. \nAlthough education can provide the basis of learning, producers and traders also need \nknowledge management systems that can provide progressive and more dynamic market \nintelligence. Market intelligence requires services that can assess the nature of demand, \nstandards requirements, trends, and projections in the relevant markets. Rather than setting \nup new market information systems, it would be more productive to link with existing private \nsources of information that are increasingly available and also with ongoing public initiatives \nsuch as those developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and by \nthe International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT by its Spanish acronym).  \n2.  Business strategies \nIt can be particularly productive for government to partner with the private sector in order to \ndevelop  strategic  medium-  and  long-term  public  responses  that  effectively  support \ncompetitive value chains. The trade participation of most producers and SMEs will occur \nthrough  value  chains.  These  are  characterized  by  systemic  rather  than  individual \nefficiencies, and value chains both generate and distribute rents, though not necessarily \nequally. Without accessible knowledge systems and supporting institutions, smaller and \nweaker chain members are more likely to be eliminated than strengthened. \nPublic-private partnership can help smallholder producers to more effectively participate in \nvalue chains; yet, an important lesson on the public side is for government to adequately \naddress the potential exclusionary impacts of standards development. \n3.  Institutional structures \nWhile national-level reach is important, locally relevant institutional structures are vital in \norder to both create immediate local capacity and establish the institutional trajectories \nnecessary to foster long-term agricultural competitiveness as well as include a broader \nportion of rural producers and SMEs. \nThese institutional structures and supporting policies include NGOs, educational centers, \nproducer  organizations,  trade  associations,  and  local  government  agencies  such  as \nextension  services.  They  also  are  market  information  systems,  certification  systems, \nregulatory  mechanisms  to  make  clear  the  rules  of  the  game,  and  enforcement \nmechanisms\u2014both public and private\u2014to monitor and ensure compliance. These hardware \nand software aspects work best when there is transparency and interrelatedness in the \nsystems. Such institutions provide consistency at the local level as well as market-oriented \nlinkages to international technology and information. Without these frameworks, smaller \n25 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nproducers and SMEs will find it difficult to adapt and to improve their capacity and to \nequitably participate in value chains and markets.  \n26 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 107    Daniele Giovannucci and Timothy Purcell \n \nReferences \nBoselie, D. 2002.
