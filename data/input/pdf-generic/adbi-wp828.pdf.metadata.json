INTRODUCTION \n\nFollowing the first oil price shock of 1973, energy prices volatility and its impact on the \nmacro-economy have become an important area of research in the field of economics. \nThe  second  oil  shock  of  1979  caused  by  the  cut  in  oil  supply  highlighted  once  again  \nthe  significance  of  immediate  energy  price  change.  Hamilton  (1983)  was  one  of  the  \nfirst  scholars,  who  showed  the  importance  of  the  energy  price  changes  to  the  U.S. \neconomy  when  he  concluded  that  oil  price  increases  had  contributed  to  some  of  \nthe U.S. recessions during the period 1948-1972. The interest in oil price fluctuations \nand  their  role  in  the  macro-economy  was  renewed  again  due  to  a  sharp  increase  \nin  oil  price  in  early  2000  and  immediate  drop  in  2008  caused  by  the  Lehman  crisis \n(Hamilton  2009;  Yoshino  and  Taghizadeh-Hesary  2014a).  Research  done  by \nPeersman  and  Van  Robays  (2012)  and  Taghizadeh-Hesary  et  al.  (2016)  identified \neconomies  that  benefited  and  lost  after  the  recent  oil  price  shock.  Aydo\u011fan  et  al. \n(2017) assess the relationship between oil prices and stock markets and show that the \ncorrelation between these varies according to whether the country is an oil-exporter or \nan oil-importer. \n\nGenerally,  oil  price  fluctuations  significantly  affect  oil  importers\u2019  production  costs  and, \ntherefore, price levels, while in energy exporting countries oil price movements mainly \naffect  energy  export  revenues  and  government  budget  revenues.  Nevertheless,  it  \nwas  widely  accepted  that  energy  price  volatility  is  not  only  an  important  cause  of \nmacro-economic fluctuations, but also affects the fiscal and monetary policy of different \neconomies. In this paper, we are going to estimate the effects of oil price changes on \nthe economy of an energy exporting country.  \n\nThis  paper  aims  to  estimate  the  impact  of  oil  price  volatility  on  one  of  the  largest  oil \nexporting  countries,  complementing  the  existing  literature  in  several  ways.  First,  we \nprovide  a  brief  overview  of  oil  price  transition  mechanisms  to  the  economy  of  an  oil \nexporting country, secondly, we explain about the world oil market. As a next stage, we \ndevelop a macro-economic model for an energy exporting country and estimate it using \na  VAR  approach.  We  also  have  conducted  a  breakpoint  test,  in  order  to  check  the \nstability of our time series. Finally, the data sample was divided into two sub-samples \nand  estimated  for  both  periods  separately.  It  provides  us  with  an  insight  on  how  the \nimpact of oil price fluctuations has changed in the long run. Moreover, we incorporated \na  monetary  variable  into  the  model,  since  we  believe  that  the  macro-economy  of  the \nenergy exporting country is affected by oil prices through the monetary policy channel. \nAt the end of this paper, we analyze the monetary policy rule for an energy exporting \ncountry.  In  conclusion,  we  discuss  the  lessons  that  can  be  drawn  from  this  energy \nexporting  country.  The  analysis  we  conducted  could  be  further  applied  to  other  \nnon-OPEC 1  oil  exporting  countries,  as  well  as  gas  exporting  economies  (such  as \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, and others).  \n\nThe  rest  of  this  paper  is  structured  as  follows:  in  the  next  section,  we  provide  an \nexplanation  of  the  oil  price  transition  mechanisms  and  a  brief  overview  of  the  world  \noil  market.  In  the  third  section,  we  provide  a  VAR  methodology  and  data  description.  \nIn  the  fourth  section,  we  provide  the  Impulse  Response  Functions  (IRF),  variance \ndecomposition and monetary policy rule analysis. In the last section, we summarize our \nresults and conclude the paper. \n\n                                                 \n1   Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, an inter-governmental organization of 14 members: \nAlgeria,  Angola,  Ecuador,  Gabon,  Indonesia,  Iran,  Iraq,  Kuwait,  Libya,  Nigeria,  Qatar,  Saudi  Arabia, \nUnited Arab Emirates, and Venezuela as in October, 2017. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\n2.  RESEARCH BACKGROUND \n\n2.1  Oil Price Transition Mechanisms  \n\nGenerally,  oil  prices  transmit  to  the  economy  of  an  energy  exporting  country  through \nthe  fiscal  channel  and  export  channel,  as  is  shown  in  the  figure  below.  Whenever  oil \nprices experience an increase, an oil exporting country enjoys larger capital inflows in \nthe  form  of  foreign  currency,  which  leads  to  domestic  exchange  rate  appreciation. \nDomestic exchange rate appreciation causes a decline in the price of imported goods, \nwhich  usually  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  total  consumer  goods  of  energy  exporting \ncountries.  Therefore,  with  an  oil  price  increase  the  general  price  level  declines \n(deflation) and as monetary policy reaction, the interest rate declines as well (according \nto the Taylor rule).  \n\nThe  second  channel  is  the  fiscal  or  government  budget  channel.  Since  the  export  \nof  energy  resources  is  highly  taxed,  with  an  oil  price  increase  the  energy  exporting \ncountry  will  have  a  fiscal  surplus  and  increase  in  government  spending,  which \neventually lead to an increase in GDP. \n\nFigure 1: Transition Channels of Oil Prices to Oil Exporting Economy \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n2.2  The World Oil Market  \n\n \n\nCrude oil is still the major energy source world-wide due to its high energy density and \nrelatively easy extraction, transportation, and refining. In the modern history of energy \nprices,  up  until  the  mid-1990s,  OPEC  has  played  a  significant  role  in  oil  pricing, \ntherefore  the  market  was  affected  purely  by  supply  factors.  However,  since  then,  the \npower  has  moved  to  non-OPEC  oil  suppliers  and  notably  oil-consumers.  This  mostly \nhappened  because  of  the  rapid  economic  growth  in  Asia,  especially  in  India  and  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  which  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  energy \nconsumption,  especially  oil.  Increased  demand  caused  diversification  of  the  supply \nside, and from the late-1990s OPEC was no longer the main oil exporter (Figure 2)2.  \n\n                                                 \n2   See more details on oil prices in Hamilton (2013) and Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary (2016). \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nFigure 2: World Crude Oil Export, 1970\u20132012 \n\nData Source: Energy Statistics Yearbook (UN) & Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ). \n\nAs  discussed  in  Yoshino  and  Alekhina  (2016),  for  those  energy  exporting  countries \nwhere oil accounts for a significant share of total export and crucially contributes to the \ngovernment  budget,  there  arises  a  risk  of  oil  price  volatility.  The  oil  market  is  highly \nvolatile  compared  to  other  commodities  due  to  the  fact  that  oil  supply  and  demand \nhave  a  low  price  elasticity,  which  makes  the  price  of  oil  fluctuate  widely.  It  therefore  \nhas  a  direct  impact  on  the  oil  exporters\u2019  economies,  as  these  depend  on  oil  export \nrevenues.  The  example  in  Figure  3  shows  the relations  between  the  nominal  GDP  of \nan energy exporting country and Brent crude oil prices. \n\nFigure 3: Nominal GDP and Brent Crude Oil Price, 1993\u20132016 \n\n \n\n \n\nData Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nFigure  4  shows  major  oil  price  trends  and  world  main  events  associated  with  oil  \nprice  fluctuations.  We  can  see  that  the  prices  of  three  different  oil  grades  are  highly \ncorrelated and basically follow the same path.  \n\nFigure 4: OPEC Basket, Brent Crude, and Urals Oil Prices, 2000\u20132014 \n\nData Source: US Energy Information Administration and Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ). \n\n \n\nAs we mentioned in the previous section, one of the channels of oil price transition to \nthe economy is the government budget. The extraction and export of natural resources \nis  highly  taxed;  therefore,  oil  and  gas  revenues  account  for  a  significant  part  of  the \nbudget  revenues.  Figure  5  shows  the  general  account  budget  revenues  of  an  oil \nexporting country for the year 2015. Oil and gas extraction tax and export duties on oil \nand  gas  sum  up  to  45%  of  total  revenues,  making  the  share  of  income  from  natural \nresources  the  biggest  in  total  budget  revenues.  Therefore,  a  decline  in  oil  prices \n(Figure 4) may put severe pressure on the government budget and macro-economy of \nan energy exporting country.  \n\nFigure 5: General Account Budget Revenues for FY 2015 \n\n \n\n \n\nData Source: Ministry of Finance of RF. \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\n3.  METHODOLOGY \n\n3.1  VAR Model \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nIn  this  section,  we  develop  an  econometric  model  to  estimate  the  interrelationship \nbetween  Brent  Crude  oil  prices  and  the  macroeconomic  fundamentals  such  as  real \nGDP growth rate, CPI inflation rate, exchange rate (against the U.S. dollar) and interest \nrate of the energy exporting country. To capture the goals of our research a structural \nVAR model was developed. Since the VAR model was introduced by Sims in 1980, it \nhas  become  one  of  the  most  useful  models  in  estimating  the  interrelationship  and \ncausality between variables. A number of studies have estimated the macroeconomic \nimpacts of oil prices using a VAR approach pioneered by Hamilton (1983). More recent \nresearch has used this approach in order to investigate the determinants of real world \noil  prices  (such  as  Kilian  2009).  Ratti  and  Vespignani  (2014)  have  estimated  the \ninterrelationships  between  oil  price  volatility  and  OPEC  and  non-OPEC  oil  production \nbehavior  using  the  VAR  approach.  Du  et  al.  (2010)  analyzed  the  impact  of  world  oil \nprices on the PRC\u2019s economy using the method of multivariate vector auto regression. \nHowever,  there  are  only  a  few  studies  that  have  estimated  the  relationship  between  \noil  price  change  and  the  macro-economy  of  non-OPEC  oil  exporting  countries  \n(for  example  Ito  2012;  Mehrara  and  Mohaghegh  2011).  In  order  to  assess  the \nabovementioned  interrelationship  between  the  world  oil  price  volatility  and  the \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals  of  an  economy,  we  consider  a  structural  VAR  model  \nas follows: \n\n\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefd + \u2211 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56\n\n\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\n\n \n\nn \u00d7 1\n\n is  a \n\n is  a \n\nwhere \n\n vector  of  endogenous  variables  of  the  model, \n is  a \n is \n vector  of  intercepts, \nXt = (X1t, X2t \u2026 Xnt)\n vector  of \nthe  lag  operator.  j  is  the  number  of  lags.

Our main objective is to estimate the impact of oil price shock on \ntwo main macroeconomic indicators, which are real GDP growth rate and CPI inflation \nrate. We also include the short-term interest rate and exchange rate in order to capture \nthe indirect effect of oil price volatility on two main macroeconomic indicators through \nthe  monetary  policy  channel  and  trade  channel  respectively.

As  we  stated \nearlier, the economy became an independent country at the end of 1991 and most of \nthe data is available from the year of 1993. A description of the variables is provided in \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nTable 1 below. Data for GDP is available on a monthly basis and is obtained from the \nMinistry of Finance and deflated to 2010. For the inflation rate, CPI inflation was used \nwith the base year of 2010. For the monetary variable, the interest rate (Central Bank \nkey rate) was used, data is obtained from the Central Bank. For the exchange rate, we \nconsidered the Ruble per U.S. dollar exchange rate, since oil trading operates mostly in \nU.S. dollars. Finally, for the world oil prices, we used Brent crude prices in U.S. dollars \nper barrel, FOB.  \n\nTable 1: Variables Description \n\nNotation \n\nVariable  \n\nReal GDP \nInflation rate \nShort-term interest rate \n\nData \nReal GDP in 2010 Rubles \nCPI inflation rate, base year is 2010  \nNominal short-term interest rate \n\nyt \n\u03c0t \nit \n\n \n\nExchange rate \n\nRuble to U.S. dollar exchange rate \n\nOil price \n\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f\n\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51\n \n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\nNote: Data for real GDP, CPI inflation rate, and oil prices are seasonally adjusted using the technique Census X-13. \n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\nData  Source:  Central  Bank,  US  Energy  Information  Administration,  IMF  International  Financial  Statistics,  Ministry  of \nFinance of RF.  \n\nPrice of Brent Crude Oil, FOB, USD/barrel \n\nThe  data  used  for  all  variables  except  the  interest  rate  is  in  logarithmic  growth  rates, \nsince  we  found  that  some  variables  in  levels  contain  unit  root  (non-stationary). \nHowever, if we convert them to the first differences they become stationary at 1% level \nof significance.3 \n\n3.3  Structural Stability Test \n\nIn  this  section,  we  are  going  to  identify  a  structural  break  in  the  data  sample.  As \ndiscussed in Yoshino and Alekhina (2016), from the early 2000s, the new government \nenacted a number of pro-growth reforms. The economy finally started to recover after \nthe financial crisis of 1998. Moreover, world oil prices were tripling by the end of 1999 \ncompared to previous years, which helped to achieve a significant export surplus and \nto  raise  government  budget  revenues.  Until  the  end  of  1999,  oil  prices  were \ncomparatively low, therefore the contribution of oil exports to GDP was relatively small. \nSince  oil  prices  started  to  rapidly  increase  in  the  late  1990s,  the  reliance  on  energy \nexport revenues and, therefore, vulnerability to oil price changes increased as well. The \nrelationship between oil prices and the economy may have changed at the time of the \nsharp  oil  price  increase,  therefore  we  assume  a  structural  break  in  2000:1.  To  find \nwhether  the  data  sample  contains  any  breakpoints,  we  have  to  carry  out  a  structural \nstability test. We used the standard Chow test, proposed by Chow (1960), to check for \nstructural breaks in variables between 1993:1 and 2016:12. The formula is as follows: \n\n\ufffd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d\u2212(\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc461+\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc462)\ufffd/\ud835\udc58\n\n  \n\n\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64 =  \n\n(\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc461+\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc462)/(\ud835\udc411+\ud835\udc412\u22122\ud835\udc58)\n\n is  a  combined  regression  line, \n\nWhere \nand after the break respectively, \nbefore and after the break, \n\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d\n\n and \n\n\ud835\udc411\n\n\ud835\udc412\n\n                                                 \n3   Statistical tests results are available upon request.  \n\n\ud835\udc58\n\n and \n\n are  regression  lines  before \n are respectively the number of observations \n\n is the number of parameters in the equation.  \n\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc461\n\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc462\n\n(3) \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nTable 2: Chow Test for Structural Break in 2000:1 \n\n200.3758 \n439.7471 \n1001.879 \n\nProb.

Therefore,  we \ncould reject a null hypothesis that the data set we use is stable. Hence, we break our \nsample into two sub-samples: 1993:1\u20131999:12, which is a period of low oil prices, and \n2000:1\u20132016:12, which is a period of relatively high oil prices. \n\n4.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n\n4.1  Impulse Response Analysis \n\nIn  this  sub-section,  we  provide  the  results  of  the  Impulse  Response  Functions  (IRF) \nanalysis,  which  was  conducted  to  capture  the  dynamics  of  the  structural  VAR  model. \nIRF provide us with the evidence of dynamic responses to the one-standard-deviation \nshock to the variable and its lagged value. The Cholesky decomposition technique was \nused  for  solving  the  system  of  linear  equations  of  the  model.  To  fulfill  the  dynamic \nimpact  of  the  shock,  we  estimated  the  responses  of  each  variable  to  the  structural \ninnovation for the 20 months ahead. \n\nWe  are  going  to  focus  on  the  results  of  the  sub-period  of  2000:1\u20132016:12,  since  \nwe  have  found  insignificant  relationships  between  oil  prices  and  macro  variables  in \n1993:1\u20131999:12.4 As we assumed, the economy was not affected by oil prices before \n2000,  since  they  were  relatively  low,  and  the  economy  was  unresponsive  to  oil  price \nchanges.  With  the  increase  in  oil  prices  from  late  1999,  the  dependence  and \nvulnerability to oil price movements increased, so the variables have showed significant \nresponses to the oil price shock from 2000. The results of IRF analysis are presented \nin  Figure  4,  which  shows  the  responses  on  real  GDP  growth  rate,  CPI  inflation  rate, \ninterest  rate,  and  exchange  rate  to  one  standard  shock  to  Brent  crude  oil  prices  with \ntwo standard error bands.  \n\nThe results of IRF analysis are in accordance with our assumptions and suggest that \nreal  GDP  growth  is  positively  affected  by  oil  prices  immediately  after  the  shock  and \nlater,  after  5  months.  As  we  mentioned,  oil  accounts  for  a  large  part  of  exports, \nmoreover,  energy  export  revenues  crucially  contribute  to  the  government  budget. \nTherefore,  total  output  is  tightly  and  positively  linked  with  oil  prices.  When  oil  prices \nexperience  a  positive  shock, \ninvestment \nopportunities  increase  which  consequently  stimulates  output  growth.  On  the  other \nhand,  the  CPI  inflation  rate,  interest  rate,  and  exchange  rate  negatively  respond  to \npositive oil price shock as is clear in Figure 4. The mechanism for this can be explained \nby  the  trade  channel  through  which  the  exchange  rate  is  directly  and  immediately \naffected by oil prices. Since the price of oil on the international market is determined in \nU.S.  dollars,  an  increase  in  oil  prices  positively  affects  foreign  reserves,  which  then \nresults in the appreciation of the domestic currency. \n\nthe  budget  revenues  and \n\ntherefore \n\n                                                 \n4   All supplementary materials are available upon request.  \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nFigure 6: Responses of Macroeconomic Indicators to Positive Innovation  \nto Brent Crude Oil Price \n\n \nNote:  Data  is  for  the  period  of  2000:1  to  2016:12  in  first  differences  of  logarithmic  form.

An  improved  exchange  rate \nmakes the import of consumer goods cheaper, therefore domestic inflation decreases. \nA large part of consumer goods of an oil exporting country is generally imported goods, \ntherefore an increase in oil prices may negatively affect the inflation rate (Figure 10). \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nFigure 7: Oil Prices, Exchange Rate, and Import Price 1997\u20132014 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: FRED. \n\nFinally, the volatility of the inflation rate affects monetary policy. Therefore, the increase \nin  oil  prices,  which  leads  to  appreciation  of  the  exchange  rate  (Figure  7)  and  a  lower \ninflation rate, negatively affects interest rate. We observe this after a positive oil shock \nin Figure 6. \n\n4.2  Variance Decomposition Analysis \n\nWe have also conducted variance decomposition analysis in order to decompose and \nestimate  the  scale  of  the  variation  in  each  endogenous  variable  due  to  the  positive \nshock in the exogenous variable (oil prices). This analysis will help us in understanding \nthe  size  of  the  impacts  of  exogenous  innovations  to  the  model.  In  our  case,  we  \nare  going  to  decompose  the  variance  of  real  GDP  growth  rate,  CPI  inflation  rate, \ninterest  rate,  and  exchange  rate  with  respect  to  oil  prices.  The  period  estimated  is \n2000:1\u20132016:12,  as  we  have  found  that  the  impacts  of  oil  prices  are  significant  only \nduring this period. The results are presented in Figure 8. \n\nThe evidence obtained from conducting variance decomposition analysis suggests that \noil  price  movements  significantly  contribute  to  the  volatility  in  macro-economic \nindicators.  More  precisely,  the  contribution  of  one  unit  shock  to  oil  prices  explains  up  \nto  2%,  4%,  8%,  and  6%  of  variability  in  real  GDP  growth,  CPI  inflation  rate,  interest  \nrate, and exchange rate respectively. It highlights once again the importance of the oil \nsector  to  the  economy  and  its  vulnerability  to  exogenous  shocks  in  oil  prices  on  the \nworld market.  \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nOverall,  the  results  we  obtained  suggest  that  the  economy  is  highly  vulnerable  to \ninnovations in oil prices. Since the energy sector and export of natural resources play a \ncrucial role in this country\u2019s economy, a decline in oil prices on the world market leads \nto  significant  deterioration  of  the  macroeconomic  performance.  On  the  other  hand, \nwhen  oil  prices  experience  growth,  it  is  beneficial  for  the  macro  economy.  Thus,  we \nhave  empirically  found  that  when  oil  prices  increase,  the  country  experiences  (i)  an \nincrease  in foreign  currency  inflows,  which  makes  it  easier  to  maintain  the  stability  of \nthe  exchange  rate,  therefore  imported  goods  become  cheaper  and  inflation  falls;  and \n(ii) the government budget enjoys a surplus, which makes real GDP grow more rapidly. \n\nFigure 8: Variance Decomposition \n\n \nNote: Data is for the period of 2000:1 to 2016:12 in first differences of logarithmic form.

According  to  the  Central  Bank  of  this  energy  exporting \ncountry,  currently  the  main  monetary  policy  instrument  is  the  key  rate  or  short-term \ninterest rate. Moreover, the Central Bank conducts its monetary policy in the framework \nof inflation targeting and since late 2014 in a free float exchange rate regime. However, \nthe true nature of the post-soviet monetary policy since the 1990s is unclear, therefore \nwe are going to test whether the monetary policy was conducted using the Taylor rule, \nwhich  is  a  setting  formula  for  central  banks\u2019  policy  rates.  There  have  been  some \nstudies  on  the  experience,  covering  different  time  spans  and  providing  different \nresults.5 We are going to focus on the longest data set available to date and cover the \nperiod  from  1993  to  2016  using  monthly  data  in  order  to  identify  the  monetary  policy \nrule for the energy exporting country.  \n\nFigure 9: Annual Inflation Rate and Inflation Target Range, 2000\u20132016 \n\nData sources: World Bank and CBR. \n\n \n\nIn order to describe the monetary policy behavior of the Central Bank, we will adopt the \nTaylor  rule  framework,  which  requires  central  banks  to  adjust  nominal  policy  rates  in \nresponse  to  movements  of  inflation  and  GDP  gaps. 6 We  will,  however,  modify  the \noriginal  Taylor  equation7 in  order  to  account  for  the  impact  of  (i)  the  exchange  rate, \nsince the country is considered as an open economy (Figure 5); and (ii) oil prices, since \nthey  have  been  proven  to  play  a  significant  role  in  the  economy  and  may  affect \nmonetary policy as well (Figure 10).  \n\nTherefore,  the  Taylor  rule  equation  we  are  going  to  estimate  will  take  the  following \nform:  \n\n \n\n\u2217\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc0 + \ud835\udefc1(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61\n\n\u2217\n) + \ud835\udefc2(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\n\n\u2217\n) + \ud835\udefc3(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\n\n\u2217\n) + \ud835\udefc4(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61\n\n) + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc61\n\n                                                 \n5   See for example Vdovichenko and Voronina (2006), Esanov et al.

For the period \n1993\u20131999  for  target,  we  used  the  average  inflation  rate  over  the  period,  and  from \n2000  the  official  Central  Bank  inflation  target  was  used.  The  GDP  growth  gap  was \ncalculated  by  removing  the  HP-trend  from  monthly  real  GDP  growth.  Exchange  rate \ngap  and  oil  prices  gap  were  calculated  by  subtracting  HP-trend  values  from  the \neffective Ruble exchange rate and from the nominal Brent crude oil prices. As for the \npolicy rate, we used the short-term interest rate. We estimated the Taylor rule equation \nfor  three  periods:  1993\u20131999,  the  period  right  after  the  abolishing  of  the  USSR  and \nwhen  the  monetary  mechanism  was  still  unclear,  2000\u20132016,  when  the  Central  Bank \nhad an official target for the inflation rate with a break in 2008 in order to account for \nthe financial crisis.  \n\n\u2217\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61\n\n\u2217\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\n\nTable  3  shows  the  results  of  the  Taylor  rule  regression  estimation,  comparing  three \ndifferent periods and using monthly  data. We can see from the table that only for the \nlatest  period  of  2008  to  2016  there  is  supporting  evidence  for  the  Taylor  rule \nspecification. For the first and second periods, the explanatory power of the models is \nvery weak and almost all the variables are insignificant. The third model has the higher \nR-squared  and  all  variables  have  correct  signs.  The  interpretation  of  the  results  is  as \nfollows,  the  higher  inflation  rate  gap  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  policy  rate,  which \nshows a clear focus on inflation targeting. The GDP gap has not shown any significant \neffect  on  policy  rate,  on  the  other  hand,  the  appreciation  of  the  exchange  rate  had  a \nnegative  impact  on  the  nominal  interest  rate,  as  well  as  the  oil  price  increase,  the \nmechanism is provided in the previous section. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nTable 3: Taylor Rule Regression Results by Period, Monthly Data \n\n \n\nInflation gap \nGDP growth gap \nRuble effective exchange rate gap \nOil prices gap \nConstant \nR2 \nNumber of observations \n\n1993\u20131999 \nPolicy Rate \n0.107*** \n\u201310.234 \n131.56 \n17.875 \n97.729*** \n0.25 \n82 \n\n2000\u20132008 \nPolicy Rate \n0.219 \n\u20132.243 \n36.536 \n\u20134.896 \n16.655*** \n0.017 \n106 \n\n2008\u20132016 \nPolicy Rate \n0.398*** \n\u20132.117 \n\u20139.28** \n\u20133.724* \n8.02*** \n0.57 \n87 \n\nNote: *** represent significance at 1%, ** represent significance at 5%, * represent significant at 10% levels.  \n\nWe  can  conclude  that  after  the  global  financial  crisis  the  monetary  authority  was \nbasically  following  the  Taylor  monetary  policy  rule  with  a  strong  focus  on  inflation \ntargeting.  \n\n5.  CONCLUDING REMARKS  \n\nIn  this  paper,  we  have  analyzed  oil  price  movement  effects  on  the  macro-economic \nindicators of one of the oil exporting countries. Although the overwhelming majority of \nprevious  studies  have  focused  on  the  impacts  of  oil  shocks  on  the  advanced \neconomies, with a special focus on oil-importers, we selected a non-OPEC oil exporter. \nDespite their crucial dependence on oil exports and important role on the international \nenergy  market,  non-OPEC  countries  were  generally  neglected  in  the  economic \nliterature,  mostly  because  of  a  lack  of  long-term  time  series  data.  For  this  study,  we \nanalyzed  the  monthly  data  sample,  which  covers  the  period  from  1993:1  to  2016:12 \nusing  a  structural  VAR  model.  This  model  can  therefore  be  applied  to  other  energy \nexporters if a data sample is obtained. \n\nThe novelty of this study is that a monetary variable was incorporated into the model, \nsince we believe that the macro-economy of the energy exporting country is affected by \noil  prices  especially  through  the  monetary  policy  channel,  which  we  have  explained  \nin  our  paper  by  estimating  the  VAR  model  and  Taylor  rule  equation.  Therefore,  this \nresearch  is  complementary  to  the  literature  on  the  impact  of  oil  price  changes  on  \nthis  oil-supplying  economy  in  various  directions.  We  believe  that  monetary  policy \nauthorities  have  to  be  aware  of  possible  unexpected  oil  price  movements  when \ndetermining  monetary  policies.  Macro-economic  indicators  of  energy  exporters  are \nhighly vulnerable to oil price changes, as this research shows, an increase in oil prices \nmay continuously and positively affect the real GDP growth, decrease CPI inflation and \ninterest rate, and lead to domestic exchange rate appreciation.  \n\nThis research can be further developed and extended. It will be left for future studies to \nassess  how  the  macro  fundamentals  of  other  non-OPEC  energy  exporters  (such  as \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, and others) are responding to oil price fluctuations. \nIt will also be interesting to identify macro-economic responses not only on aggregate, \nbut  also  on  sectoral  level  (such  as  industrial,  transportation,  and  others).  Comparing \nthe  impacts  of  oil  price  shocks  on  this  group  of  economies  and  finding  patterns  will \neventually  contribute  to  the  development  of  policy  implications  that  can  possibly  help \nthese economies to strategically deal with unexpected oil price changes. \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 828 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAlekhina and Yoshino \n\nAydo\u011fan, B., G.

We focus on an economy, which is a non-OPEC oil exporter and its oil revenues \naccount  for  a  significant  proportion  of  the  country\u2019s  total  export  and  budget  revenues.  We \nexplain the oil price transition mechanisms to this economy from the export side and through \nthe fiscal channel taking into account the monetary policy factor. The results suggest that oil \nprice  fluctuations  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  oil  exporting  country\u2019s  real  GDP,  CPI \ninflation rate, interest rate, and exchange rate. Moreover, to estimate monetary policy rule for \nthis energy exporter, we test the Taylor equation and associated Taylor rule, including the oil \nprices  gap,  since  the  latter  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  key  policy  rate.  The \nevidence suggests that the Taylor rule describes the post-financial crisis monetary policy of \nthis  economy  relatively  well.  Finally,  we  discuss  future  research  and  lessons  from  this \neconomy for monetary policy makers.  \n \nKeywords: oil prices, energy exporters, macro-economy, VAR model \n \nJEL Classification: Q41, Q43, Q48 \n \n", " \n"]}
