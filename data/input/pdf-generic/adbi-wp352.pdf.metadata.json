Even though Thailand is not obligated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it \nvoluntarily takes numerous actions to mitigate emissions. Both the public and private sector \nhave been actively involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a series of measures \nand actions implemented in each sector. \nThe development of renewable energy and the promotion of energy conservation and efficiency \nare  the  primary  means  to  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  Thailand.  With  the \nestablishment of the Energy Conservation Program in 1995, a viable movement for energy \nconservation and efficiency and renewable energy had begun. Over the years, progress in \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency has been made. Recently, the 15-Year Renewable \nEnergy  Development  Plan  and  the  20-Year  Energy  Conservation  Plan  comprised  several \ninnovative measures and incentive mechanisms to further advance the development of energy \nefficiency and renewable energy. Regardless of government policies and measures, the private \nsector has also taken part in greenhouse gas emissions mitigation by implementing a number of \nactivities  to  reduce  carbon  sources  (e.g.,  improved  production  processes  and  resource \nefficiency) and to create carbon sinks (e.g., reforestation and mangrove plantations). \nThailand has made significant progresses toward green and low-carbon development; however, \nthere is a need to further address the issue. The country has to focus on the implementation of \nno-regret policies to ensure the decoupling of economic growth, while starting to look further at \nimplementing least-cost policies. There should be short-term policies to immediately address a \nrapid increase of greenhouse gas emissions and long-term policies to address fundamental \nchanges towards a green and low-carbon society. \nJEL Classification: Q54, Q58 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nContents \n \n \n1.

INTRODUCTION \n1.1  Current Economic Development and Future Emission Profiles \nThailand is a developing country in Southeast Asia, which has shifted from having an \nagriculture-based economy to an industry-driven economy. Since 1960, there has been rapid \neconomic growth in Thailand, with significant expansion of the industry sector. The contribution \nto gross domestic product (GDP) of the industry sector increased from 22.6% during the 1960s \nto 43.9% in 2005 (Akrasanee 2006). \nThe national economy is predicted to continue to grow at a slower rate up to 2030. The National \nInstitute of Development Administration projected that Thailand\u2019s GDP would increase by 3%\u2013\n5% per year from 2010 to 2030 (based on electricity demand) (Table 1.1). \nTable 1.1: Thailand Gross Domestic Product Projection \nYear  Low Scenario  Base Scenario  High Scenario \n2010  3.41  3.41  3.41 \n2011  3.88  4.02  4.28 \n2012  3.84  4.24  4.78 \n2013  3.50  4.06  4.24 \n2014  4.32  4.78  5.12 \n2015  3.97  4.46  4.83 \n2016  3.82  4.28  4.61 \n2017  3.85  4.28  4.60 \n2018  3.68  4.10  4.43 \n2019  3.75  4.15  4.49 \n2020  3.87  4.24  4.58 \n2021  3.82  4.18  4.53 \n2022  3.63  4.01  4.37 \n2023  3.60  3.95  4.31 \n2024  3.58  3.92  4.28 \n2025  3.58  3.92  4.28 \n2026  3.58  3.92  4.28 \n2027  3.58  3.92  4.28 \n2028  3.58  3.92  4.28 \n2029  3.58  3.92  4.28 \n2030  3.58  3.92  4.28 \nNotes: Figures in the table represent GDP growth.

Each scenario reflects the possibility of economic growth, e.g., the low \nscenario refers to low economic growth and high scenario refers to high economic growth. \nSource: National Institute of Development Administration 2010 \nBased on the GDP projection (GDP data from 2031 to 2050 are assumed to be the same as \nGDP in 2030, and sector GDP data are assumed based on expert opinions) and other key data \nfor each sector, greenhouse gas emission projection until 2050 was carried out by the Joint \nGraduate School for Energy and Management (JGSEE) for the Thailand Greenhouse Gas \nManagement Organization (TGO). The study projected greenhouse gas emissions for three \nscenarios: business as usual, power development plan 2010, and climate plan scenario. \n1.1.1  Business-as-Usual Scenario  \nUnder the business as usual (BAU) scenario, greenhouse gas emission from all economic \nactivities were estimated without any implementation of greenhouse gas emission reduction \nactivities.

Therefore,  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  are \nimportant considerations when addressing energy security and economic growth, as well as \nclimate change in Thailand (Nakawiroa, Bhattacharyyaa, and Limmeechokchaib 2008).  \nThe current direction for key greenhouse gas emissions reduction policies in Thailand have \nbeen laid down until 2030. With the 15-Year Renewable Energy Development Plan, the 20-Year \nEnergy Conservation Plan, and the Power Development Plan 2010 (PDP 2010), the country\u2019s \ndirection can be summarized as follows: renewable energy and energy efficiency will be further \npromoted  with  both  traditional  and  innovative  measures  to  increase  energy  security  and \nsafeguard the environment. Public\u2013private partnership will be emphasized and the role of the \nprivate sector in promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency will be more prominent. \nAdditionally, massive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are expected.  \nEven  though  the  development  of  renewable  energy  and  progress  on  energy  efficiency  is \nexpected, it is unavoidable that fossil fuels will remain the primary source of energy supply and \nThailand  will  still  rely  on  imported  energy.  Based  on  the  current  policies  and  plans,  the \nchallenges for Thailand to foster green and low-carbon development are renewable energy \nutilization and the PDP 2010.   \n1.3.1.1  Renewable Energy Utilization \nAlthough  the  15-Year  Renewable  Energy  Development  Plan  (described  in  section  2)  is \nformulated based upon the domestic potentials in the country, there are challenges for the \ncountry to meet the renewable energy utilization targets. Based on the implementation result in \n2010, the gaps between the utilization target and actual utilization can be clearly observed, \nespecially for wind, hydropower, biomass, and municipal waste (Table 1.8). \nTable 1.8: Renewable Energy Utilization, 2010 \nRenewable Energy Source  Utilization   Target   Difference \nWind (MW)  5.61  45.00  (39.39) \nSolar  Electricity (MW)  48.57  48.00  0.57 \nHeat (ktoe)  2.14  2.80  (0.66) \nHydropower (MW)  58.85  142.00  (83.15) \nBiomass  Electricity (MW)  1,650.00  2,454.00  (804.00) \nHeat (ktoe)  3,136.00  3,130.00  (6.00) \nBiogas  Electricity (MW)  103.40  55.00  48.40 \nHeat (ktoe)  311.00  320.00  (9.00) \nMunicipal waste  Electricity (MW)  13.13  58.00  (44.87) \nHeat (ktoe)  1.09  7.00  (5.91) \nEthanol (million liters/day)   1.23  2.11  (0.88) \nBiodiesel (million liters/day)  1.72  1.35  0.37 \nktoe = thousand tons of oil equivalent, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency 2011a. \nThere are several challenges for increasing renewable energy utilization, one of the key ones \nbeing the lack of financial incentive.

The PDP 2010 is trying to address these issues by diversifying energy \nsources through the introduction of nuclear power and coal. However, the suitability and public \nacceptance of nuclear power and coal are issues that need to be addressed. \nNuclear Power  \nBefore the nuclear accident in Fukushima (Japan) in 2010, most Thai people agreed with \nnuclear power, although they did not want the nuclear power plants to be located in their \ncommunities and provinces. Since the Fukushima accident, the public and media are very much \naware of the dangers of nuclear power, and the problems that may occur in Thailand if nuclear \npower plants are constructed. Furthermore, there are concerns and questions regarding the \nreadiness of, and the need for, Thailand to have nuclear power plants. There are also strong \nantinuclear movements, especially in the potential locations for the nuclear power plants. The \npublic is urging the government not to ever build nuclear power plants in Thailand. Currently, the \ngovernment has ceased the process of considering nuclear power plants, but nuclear power is \nstill in the PDP 2010. \nCoal-Fired Power  \nCoal-fired power plants are also not welcomed by most Thai people, and serious questions \nsurround the health and environmental impacts of coal, especially air pollution. There are anti-\ncoal movements in several areas, especially potential construction areas. The government has \nprovided  information  about  coal  being  environmentally  friendly  when  used  in  clean  coal \ntechnologies; however, the public still does not agree with coal-fired power plants. \nWith a solution being required for achieving energy security, the government together with the \npublic and other stakeholders should agree on a future national power plan, including nuclear \npower and coal power. \n1.3.2  Industry Sector \nThe industry sector has been involved in greenhouse gas emissions reduction through energy \nefficiency and conservation activities. There are a range of measures and programs provided by \nthe government to support energy conservation and efficiency in industry, and progress has \nbeen made. However, implementation is limited to large and medium-sized enterprises. As \nthere are millions of  small enterprises in Thailand, the challenge remains for related agencies to \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \npromote and provide support for small enterprises to improve their performance on energy \nefficiency and conservation. \nEnergy efficiency technologies are the other main obstacle to achieving a low-carbon industry \nsector. Such technologies are still expensive and technology deployment remains difficult for a \nnumber of industries. It is essential for the relevant agencies to consider how to bring down the \ncost of energy efficiency technologies so that deployment can occur on a wide scale. \nThe other strategy for promoting greenhouse gas emissions reduction in the industry sector is to \npromote greenhouse gas emissions reduction by using on-site renewable energy generation \ntechnologies. There are several viable renewable technology options that can be installed at \nfactory sites to generate energy. However, promotion of and support for on-site renewable \nenergy  generation  technologies  in  industry  are  not  yet  realized  in  the  policy.  Thus,  it  is \nnecessary  for  policy  makers  to  consider  the  possibilities  that  on-site  renewable  energy \ngeneration technologies offer the industry sector. \n1.3.3  Agriculture Sector \nGreenhouse gas emission reduction policies in agriculture involve farmers\u2019 practices, such as \ncontrolling water in rice fields and changing crop cultivation practices. Changing traditional \npractices can be a challenge because farmers are used to traditional practices.  \n1.3.4  Waste Sector \nPolicies on waste in Thailand are in line with the \u201d3Rs\u201d concept.2 There are a number of \nprograms and activities to promote the implementation of 3Rs, especially in Bangkok and other \nbig cities; however, waste management remains a problem. The key challenges for the waste \nsector pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions reduction are to reduce or maintain the waste \ngeneration rate and increase the recycling rate.  \nWaste generation involves both product provision systems (ways that products are produced \nand provided for consumers) and consumption behaviors. In Thailand, the consumption level, \nespecially  in  cities,  is  growing  due  to  many  factors,  including  changing  lifestyles;  people \ngenerally  consume  more  than they  used  to.  Additionally,  there  are  increasing  numbers of \ndisposable products and packaging. As a result, reducing or maintaining the waste generation \nrate is a challenging task.  \nWaste recycling rate in Thailand is still low (23% of household waste was recycled in 2008 [PCD \n2009]). Possible explanations for low recycling rates are that people do not separate wastes, \ninfrastructure  for  waste  separation  is  not  in  place,  the  waste  collection  system  does  not \ncorresponded to recycling practices, and there are limited recycling technologies. These are the \nkey challenges for increasing the waste recycling rate. \n                                                \n2 3Rs concept refers to reuse, reduce, and recycle. \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.

Under the plan, it is expected that greenhouse gas emissions \nwill be reduced by about 49 MtCO eq by 2030 (Ministry of Energy 2009). \n2\nThe target of the plan (Table 2.5) is to reduce energy intensity by 8% in 2015, by 15% in 2020, \nand by 25% in 2030 (the reduction of energy intensity is about 1.5% annually) compared with \nthe base year (2005), and to reduce final energy consumption at 20% in 2030. \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nTable 2.5: Target for Energy Conservation under the 20-Year Energy Conservation \nPlan \nTechnical Potential \nTarget  Ratio \nHeat  Electricity  Total \n(ktoe)  (%) \nSector  (ktoe)  (GWh)  (ktoe) \nTransport  16,250  0  16,250  13,400  44.7 \nIndustry  10,950  33,500  13,790  11,300  37.7 \nCommercial and residential           \nLarge building  410  27,420  2,740  2,300  7.6 \nSmall building and residential  1,690  23,220  3,670  3,000  10.0 \nhouse \nTotal  29,300  84,140  36,450  30,000  100.0 \nGWh = gigawatt hour, ktoe = thousand tons of oil equivalent \nSource: Ministry of Energy 2011a \nTo achieve the target, the plan includes a number of policy measures for promoting energy \nefficiency\u2014energy standards and regulations, capacity building, energy efficiency networking, \nawareness raising, and financial incentives (Table 2.6). \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nTable 2.6: Implementing the 20-Year Energy Conservation Plan \nStrategy  Measure \nUsing regulations and standards   \u2022  Enforcing law and regulation \n\u2022  Using mandatory abelling \n\u2022  Minimum energy performance standards \n\u2022  Energy efficiency resources standards \nPromoting and supporting energy  \u2022  Voluntary agreement (for energy conservation) \nconservation   \u2022  Measures to support the use of energy abelling for products, \nbuildings, and vehicles \n\u2022  Measures to support mass transportation and high-efficiency \nlogistics systems \n\u2022  Measures to support investment in energy conservation \nthrough DSM bidding (for large business) and standard offer \nprogram (for SMEs) \n\u2022  Support ESCOs through ESCO Fund \nRaising awareness and changing  \u2022  Supporting the concepts of a low-carbon society and low-\nbehaviors  carbon economy \n\u2022  Setting energy prices to reflect the true costs and use taxes \nas a tool to support energy conservation \nSupporting the development of  \u2022  Measures to support research and development for increasing \ntechnologies and innovations  energy efficiency of technologies and for reducing the cost of \ntechnologies \n\u2022  Measures to support the demonstration of high and advanced \ntechnologies and to support the deployment of technologies \nBuilding capacity for human resources  \u2022  Measures to support ESCOs to be in charge of managing and \nand institutes  implementing energy conservation  \n\u2022  Measures to support capacity building for government and \nprivate agencies and institutes to be in charge of planning, \ncontrolling, and supporting the implementation of energy \nconservation \nESCOs = energy service companies, SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Ministry of Energy 2011a \n2.2  Current Pledges and Implications of Sector Policies  \nWith the realization of the importance of energy security and climate change in Thailand, there \nhas been investment in greenhouse gas emissions mitigation investments in several sectors. In \ngeneral, most pledges and actions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that have been given \nand taken are considered to be \u201cno-regret\u201d3 policies and actions. Most of these implementation \napproaches are related to energy efficiency, renewable energy (based on local resources and \npotentials),  forest  conservation,  and  afforestation  and  reforestation.  Additionally,  least-cost \npolicy options are being implemented in the energy sector. However, most sectors do not have \nclear greenhouse gas reduction targets (in terms of MtCO eq); most targets are set based on \n2\nthe policies, plans, and actions themselves, which are usually implemented in more than one \nsector. The details of pledges and actions for each sector are described in sections 2.2.1\u20132.2.7. \n                                                \n3\n No-regret policies and actions can be referred to as policies and actions that create economic benefits (or at least \nno economic losses) and result in reduction of greenhouse gases. \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.2.1  Energy and Power Sector \n2.2.1.1  Alternative and Renewable Energy \nSince  the  beginning  of  the  ENCON  Program  in  Thailand,  the  government  has  adopted \nnumerous policies and measures to ensure renewable energy is developed and utilized.

One of the key implications is the substantial growth of the \nsector, especially small and very small  power producers (SPPs and VSPPs). Policy measures \nallowed small producers to join the energy production sector (financially) and attracted investors \nto renewable energy projects. The growth of the energy production sector is a reflection of the \nincreasing number of renewable energy projects in Thailand, especially in biomass, biogas and \nbiofuel.  \nAnother key implication is on national energy security. Introducing renewable energy promotion \npolicies and measures has increased the energy security of the nation. Developing and utilizing \nrenewable  energy  increases  energy  availability,  enhances  energy  diversity,  augments  the \navailability  of  clean  energy  technologies,  improves  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  power \nproduction, reduces dependency on imported energy, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom power production. \nHowever,  there  are  some  concerns  regarding  development  and  utilization  of  renewable \nenergy\u2014such as competition for resource utilization, forest intrusion, and the \u201cfood versus fuel\u201d \nissue. Moreover, some current incentives may not be sufficient to attract investment in some \nrenewable energy sources, such as wind power. \n2.2.2  Industry Sector \n2.2.2.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Energy Conservation and Efficiency \nThailand began to take serious action on energy conservation and efficiency in the early 1990s. \nOne of the notable programs to promote energy conservation and efficiency in the industry \nsector  is  the  national  Energy  Conservation  (ENCON)  Program  It  comprises  a  number  of \ncompulsory,  voluntary,  and  complementary  measures  and  activities  (Table  2.9).

One of the comprehensive approaches to promoting energy efficiency is total \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nenergy management (TEM),4 which takes into account both technological improvements and \nemployee training for energy efficiency and conservation. \nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Through Labeling Schemes \nThe Carbon Reduction Label is a label that shows reduced greenhouse gas emissions of the \nproduct or service (for the same manufacturer compared with base year [2002]) in terms of \ncarbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent. It has been established through cooperation between the \n2\nThailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) and the Thailand Environment \nInstitute  (TEI). The  aims  are  to  encourage manufacturers  and  consumers  to  be  a  part of \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction. During the initial stage (up until November 2011), the \nscope of evaluation for greenhouse gas reduction has been limited solely to the production \nstage. The implementation and implementation results of the Carbon Reduction Label are in \nBox.1. \nIn  addition  to  the  Carbon  Reduction  Label,  there  are  other  labeling  schemes  related  to \ngreenhouse gas emission reductions, including Carbon Footprint, CoolMode, Green Label, and \nEnergy Efficiency Label (non-electrical). Carbon Footprint is a label showing greenhouse gas \nemissions  from  each  production  unit  for  the  product  life  cycle  (cradle  to  grave),  i.e.,  the \ncalculation of greenhouse gas emissions emitted from raw material extraction, transportation, \nproduction, utilization, and waste management of product. The aims of the Carbon Footprint \nlabel are to increase the attention of the industry sector on greenhouse gas emissions and to \nincrease the competitiveness of Thai industries in the world market. As of September 2011, \nthere were 233 products from 68 companies certified with Carbon Footprint (TGO 2011c). \nCoolMode is a label initiative for clothing showing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions \nas a result of reduced electricity consumption. The label will be issued to textile manufacturers \nwho make materials that are comfortable to wear and breathable, allowing for decreased energy \nconsumption due to reduced need for air conditioning. Furthermore, the fabric should be easy to \nclean to reduce water consumption. The aims are to encourage the textile industry to develop \nCoolMode fabrics for selling in the domestic and export market and to give consumers more \noptions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As of September 2011, 18 types of fabric from six \ncompanies were certified with CoolMode (TGO 2011a). \nGreen  Label  is  a  Type  I  eco-label,  which  awards  specific  products  that  have  reduced \nenvironmental impacts from a life-cycle perspective than other products with the same function. \nAn initiative of the Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development (TBCSD), the Green \nLabel was launched in 1994 by the Thailand Environment Institute (TEI) in association with the \nMinistry of Industry. From the initial period to June 2011, there were certification criteria for 48 \nproducts, and 506 products from 25 product categories and 75 producers were registered (TEI \n2011). \nThe  Energy  Efficiency  Label  was  initiated  by  the  Department  of Alternative  Energy \nDevelopment  and  Efficiency  (DEDE)  to  address  high  energy  consumption  (non-electrical) \nmachines, equipment, and materials. The label covers household gas stoves, variable speed \ndrives, insulators, and energy-saving glass. As of 2009, the Energy Efficiency Label program \nhad issued 577,850 labels for gas stoves, which generated fuel savings equal to 21 thousand \ntons of oil equivalent (ktoe) and reduced greenhouse gas emissions of 0.118 MtCO eq/year \n2\n(Sajjakulnukit 2011). \n                                                \n4\n Details of the TEM approach can be found in the TEM handbook: available at http://www.asiaeec-\ncol.eccj.or.jp/cooperation/1-1-1/01.pdf \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.2.2.3  Implications of Industry Sector Policies  \nImplemented  alternative  and  renewable  energy  and  energy  conservation  and  efficiency \nmeasures have a number of positive implications for sector policy and the economy. The first is \nawareness of energy and environmental issues in the industry sector. Because burgeoning \nindustrial  development  in  Thailand  brought  environmental  and  high-energy  consumption \nproblems along with economic growth, the Government of Thailand introduced environmental \nregulations as well as energy conservation and efficiency measures (both compulsory and \nvoluntary). This led the industry sector to incorporate environmental rationalities as well as \nenergy conservation and efficiency principles into corporate principles and practices. However, \nthe implementation of these principles varies by industry and company. \nThe second implication is the utilization of wastes and unused materials for energy production. \nRenewable energy incentive schemes made it possible to utilize wastes and unused materials \nto generate power and electricity. This brings financial and environmental benefits to both the \ncompany and the environment. \nThe third implication is the competitiveness of the industry sector and growth of the national \neconomy. The implementation of energy conservation and efficiency measures is related to \ntechnical  and  behavioral  changes,  which  manifested  as  lower  energy  consumption  (lower \nenergy costs). As a result, the competitiveness of Thai industries has increased, allowing them \nto compete globally. This is especially true for export-oriented industries such as the electrical \nand  electronics  industry  and  the  food  processing  industry.  Increased  competitiveness  also \ncontributes to national economic growth in terms of revenue from exports. \nThe fourth implication is the environmental and climate change awareness of consumers. Since \nthe emergence of the Green Label (in 1992) and now with the current initiatives on carbon \nlabeling (Carbon Reduction Label, Carbon Footprint, and CoolMode), awareness of consumers \non environmental issues, especially climate change, has significantly increased. This is reflected \nin the survey, Thai People with Global Warming, conducted in Bangkok and other large cities in \nThailand including in Chiang Mai province, Khonkaen province, and Songkhla province by \nAssumption University. The survey shows that more than 97% of the population were aware of \nglobal warming, more than 82% perceived that global warming posed a threat to the national \neconomy, and more than 67% were concerned that global warming would pose a threat to their \nworking  conditions  (Assumption  University,  cited  in  Chotichanathawewong  and  Thongplew \n2009).  One  reason  that  climate  change  and  global  warming  have  become  well  known  is \nbecause of the labeling schemes. \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nBox 1: Case Study: Carbon Reduction Label \nImplementation: \n\uf06c  Aims to encourage manufacturers and consumers to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions \nthrough everyday purchasing \n\uf06c  151 products from 37 manufacturers obtained Carbon Reduction Label (as of September \n2011) (Vongvanich 2011) \n\uf06c  Certified  products  include  food  and  beverages,  personal  products,  packaging, \nequipment, and construction materials \nKey results and implications: \n\uf06c  Greenhouse gas emission reduction from this program is estimated at 4.47 MtCO eq (as \n2\nof September 2011) (Vongvanich 2011) \n\uf06c  Climate change awareness is increasing among manufactures and consumers, and \ngreenhouse gas mitigation actions have been taken \n \n2.2.3  Commercial and Residential Sector \n2.2.3.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Energy Conservation and Efficiency \nThe Government of Thailand has implemented a number of measures on energy conservation \nand efficiency in the commercial and residential sector (under the ENCON Program). Several \npolicy measures for promoting energy efficiency (Table 2.10) are being implemented under \ndemand-side  management  and  other  policies\u2014energy  standards  and  regulations,  capacity \nbuilding, energy efficiency networking, awareness raising, and financial incentives.  \nIn the commercial sector, implemented activities promote the use of energy efficient equipment \nand energy conservation. Most fiscal and financial measures for promoting energy efficiency in \nthe commercial sector are the same as those in the industry sector\u2014Revolving Fund, ESCO \nFund, tax incentives, and subsidy. \nIn  the  residential  sector,  implemented  measures  are  mostly  campaigns  promoting  energy \nefficient appliances and creating awareness on energy saving. It is estimated that the demand-\nside management program can reduce the demand for electricity by 120 MW/year (du Pont \n2005). One of the ongoing energy efficiency activities implemented under the demand-side \nmanagement program is the Energy Efficiency Label (Energy Label No. 5). The program is \ntargeted at reducing the use of high energy consumption appliances and products through \nenergy efficiency certification. The Energy Label No. 5 program is regarded as successful (du \nPont 1998; Singh and Mulholland 2000). \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nTable 2.10: Energy Efficiency Instruments Implemented in the Commercial and \nResidential Sector \nCommercial/ \nPolicy Measure   Residential  Implementation \nEquipment/appliance  Commercial  Yes \nlabeling  Residential  Yes \nBuilding codes  Commercial  Yes \nResidential  No \nEnergy Audits  Commercial  Voluntary \nResidential   \nFiscal and financial  Commercial  Revolving Fund \nincentives  (ENCON Fund), \nESCO Fund, Tax \nincentives, and \nSubsidy* \nResidential  No \nEnergy efficiency  Commercial  Yes \nnetworking  Residential  No \nAwards  Commercial  Yes \nResidential  Yes** \nCampaign programs  Commercial  Yes \nResidential  Yes \n* Described in Chapter 3. \n**Energy conservation award for homes \nSource: Author\u2019s summary \n2.2.3.2  Implications of Commercial and Residential Sector Policies  \nThe  implication  of  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  measures  for  the  commercial  and \nresidential sector is increasing concern in Thai society on energy efficiency. Further, appliance \nproducers can continue to manufacture more efficient products.5  \n2.2.4  Building Sector \n2.2.4.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Energy Conservation and Efficiency \nMost of the energy conservation and energy efficiency measures for the building sector are \nimplemented in combination with the commercial and residential sector (under the ENCON \nProgram). The measures for buildings are building codes and regulations, capacity building, \nenergy efficiency networking, awareness raising, and financial incentives.  \nOne discrete policy measure exists for the building sector, whereby energy management is \nimplemented for designated buildings and factories and building energy codes are implemented \nfor new buildings. \n2.2.4.2  Carbon Reduction Certification for Building \nCarbon Reduction Certification for Building is a voluntary initiative of the Thailand Environment \nInstitute  (TEI)  and  the  Thailand  Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development  (TBCSD) \nintroduced  in  2010.  Its  aim  is  to  encourage  nonresidential  building  owners  to  reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions through reduced of electricity consumption, fossil fuel consumption, \n                                                \n5\n Energy Label No. 5 is discussed further in section 3. \n26 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nand waste generation. This certification scheme allows building owners to declare their intention \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions and communicate this to the public. This scheme also \ncreates  a  commitment  by  and  incentives  for  building  owners  to  continue  to  improve  their \ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction strategies and actions for the building. As of September \n2011,  eight  buildings  from  five  companies  had  been  awarded  with  the  Carbon  Reduction \nCertification for Building, resulting in greenhouse gas emission reductions of around 16,000 tons \nCO eq/year (compared with base year in 2002) (Thailand Environment Institute 2011b). \n2\n2.2.4.3  Implications of Building Sector Policies  \nIt is clear that policy measures and voluntary activities in energy conservation and efficiency in \nthe building sector have resulted in increasing awareness on energy efficiency and climate \nchange. As a result of enforced standards, codes, awards, and labeling schemes, the building \nsector, and especially designated buildings, have adopted the concept of energy conservation \nand  efficiency  and  implemented  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  measures  in  order  to \ncomply with regulations. Some proactive organizations take further actions in order to be seen \nas leaders in energy efficiency by applying for the international green building certification \u2013 \nLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). \n2.2.5  Transport Sector \n2.2.5.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Alternative and Renewable Energy  \nIn the transport sector, use of biofuels (gasohol and biodiesel) is promoted on both the demand \nand supply sides. Demand-side measures are the mandatory and voluntary uses of gasohol and \nbiodiesel  for  vehicles.  One  mandatory  measure  applies  to  diesel  fuel,  whereby  diesel  for \nvehicles  is  diesel  B3  (3%  biodiesel).  Additionally,  price  incentives  for  consumers  are \nimplemented in some high-percentage biofuels (E10, E20, E85, and B5).  \nOn the supply side, measures are implemented under the REDP, which are described in the \nsections of background information (Section 2.1.2) and pledges and policy actions of energy \nand power sector (Section 2.2.1) (fiscal and other incentive measures are implemented for \nethanol and biodiesel producers). \nThe government also gives strong support to the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) in the \ntransport sector, including public transport (buses and taxis) by subsidizing the retail price. \nWithin the last few years, the demand for CNG for vehicles has substantially increased due to \nthe high price of gasoline and the subsidized price of CNG. The number of fuelling stations has \nincreased to serve the demand for CNG. \n2.2.5.2  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Energy Efficiency and Public Transport \nOther energy efficiency transport sector policies are \u201ceco cars\u201d, public transport, and park-and-\nride scheme policies. The eco car policy provides incentives for car manufacturers to produce \ncars that have small engines, are energy efficient, and have low fuel consumption and high \nemission standards. The extension of mass public transport, especially in Bangkok, is another \ngovernment policy\u2014BTS skytrain, MRT system, and Bus Rapid Transit are new public transport \nsystems in the Bangkok metropolitan area. The BTS Skytrain is a mass public transport system \nwith extended coverage in Bangkok and vicinity. The MRT system (also known as Bangkok \nMetro) is an underground mass rapid transit system, which also has an extension plan. Bus \nRapid Transit carries commuters between suburbs and the city. The park-and-ride scheme \nprovides parking areas for commuters in outer areas so they can then travel to the city using \nskytrains and underground trains. \n27 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.2.5.3  Implications of Transport Sector Policies  \nIntroducing biofuels, natural gas, and eco car policies has a number of implications for the \ntransport  sector.  Car  manufacturers  have  adapted  to  changes  in  government  policy  by \nintroducing new cars to the market, such as eco cars (high fuel efficiency and low emissions) \nand cars that use biofuels. \nAnother  implication  is the  change  in fuel  use for  vehicles.  Because of  the  higher  cost of \ngasoline, many car users, including personal car users, have modified their cars for CNG use. \nThe switch from gasoline to CNG has occurred mostly in areas where there are natural gas \nfuelling stations available, especially in big cities such as Bangkok. \nThe  other  implication  is  the  use  of  public  transportation  among  people  in  Bangkok  and \nsurrounded areas. BTS skytrain and MRT system have become the main choice of commuters \ntraveling from suburbs to the city and commuting within the city. \n2.2.6  Agriculture Sector \nRecently, the Government of Thailand implemented an agricultural plan on climate change \n(including both greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation), which focuses on research and \ndevelopment for new plants (high yield and resistance, and low maintenance and inputs), \nplantations,  production  of  agricultural  products,  agricultural  technologies,  and  logistics. \nHowever, implementation is still in the early stages. \n2.2.7  Other Pledges and Actions \n2.2.7.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction Through Forest Conservation and Afforestation and \nReforestation \nThe aim of the key national forest policy is to have at least 40% of the country\u2019s area as forest, \nwhich  is  to  be  utilized  for  two  primary  purposes.  The  first  purpose  is  for  conservation \n(conserving soil, water, plants, and wild animals), including for study, research, and recreation \n(25% of the national area) (Royal Forest Department 2011b). The second purpose is for forest \nto be used economic purposes (15% of the national area). \nThe forest area in Thailand decreased to 25% in the late 1990s. Since then, forest areas have \ncontinuously  increased  as  a  result  of  forest  conservation,  afforestation,  and  reforestation \nactivities.  In  2008,  national  forest  coverage  is  about  33.5%.  Thus,  the  activities  on  forest \nconservation, afforestation, and reforestation will be continued in order to increase the forest \nareas. \n28 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nTable 2.11: Forest Areas in Thailand \nForest Area   Percentage of \nYear  (km2)  forest to total area \n1973  221,707.00  43.21 \n1976  198,417.00  38.67 \n1978  175,224.00  34.15 \n1982  156,600.00  30.52 \n1985  150,866.00  29.40 \n1988  143,803.00  28.03 \n1989  143,417.00  27.95 \n1991  136,698.00  26.64 \n1993  133,554.00  26.03 \n1995  131,485.00  25.62 \n1998  129,722.00  25.28 \n2000  170,110.78  33.15 \n2004  167,590.98  32.66 \n2005  161,001.30  31.38 \n2006  158,652.59  30.92 \n2008  171,585.65  33.44 \nkm2 = square kilometer. \nSource: Royal Forest Department 2011 \n2.2.7.2  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through the Clean Development Mechanism \nThailand as a developing country is listed as a non-Annex I Party, and thus does not have an \nobligation to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. However, Thailand \nparticipated in greenhouse gas emissions reduction under the Kyoto Protocol through the Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM).  In  Thailand,  the  CDM  has  played  a  significant  role  in \ngreenhouse gas mitigation because it has helped make greenhouse gas emissions reduction \nmore feasible. \nAs of 1 October 2010, the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization had issued 146 \nletters  of  approval  for  CDM  projects.

Several \nenterprises and companies have implemented activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by \ncreating carbon sinks and reducing carbon emissions. One of the most implemented activities is \ncreating carbon sinks through afforestation and reforestation.

This  handbook  can  then  be  used  to  create  low-carbon  cities  in  other \nmunicipalities. \n2.3.2.2  Phalaui Island  \nPhalaui Island is a small island in SuratThanni province, with a population of less than 500.

Solar  power  and  wind  power  are  utilized  to generate  electricity. The \nproject  also  supports  the  utilization  and/or  reutilization  of  biomass,  biogas,  and  biofuel. \nAdditionally, the use of high-energy-efficiency light bulbs, electrical motors, efficient stoves, and \nsolar-powered drying beds (for producing dried food) is encouraged to improve the livelihood of \npeople, energy use, and the island\u2019s environment.

Renewable energy and energy efficiency are the key potentials. Based \nupon the evaluation of the ENCON program, the investments for renewable energy and energy \nefficiency in Thailand provide significant benefits for the country. Financial benefits created by \nenergy saving are greater than financial investment on renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects (EPPO Undated). The financial benefits originate from energy saving and reduction of \nimported energy. Currently, Thailand has high energy intensity, at 16.2 ktoe/billion baht in 2005, \nand also has high energy elasticity at 0.98 (average for the last 20 years) (Ministry of Energy \n2011a). Based on the cost\u2013benefit estimation for the spending budget and financial benefits \nfrom energy saving, financial benefits are greater than the spending budget. Thus, if Thailand is \nable to increase energy efficiency (reduce energy elasticity and energy intensity), this will create \na decoupling scenario. \nA number of potential energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in many sectors \nhave potential for the decoupling of economic development and low-carbon emissions. In the \nindustry sector, efficient furnaces, boilers, arc furnaces, chillers, air compressors, and motors \nhave negative abatement costs. In the commercial and residential sector, efficient LPG stoves, \ncompact fluorescent lamps, and air conditioners (Energy Label No.5) have negative abatement \ncosts. In  the  energy  and  power  sector,  biomass  and  biomass technologies  have  negative \nabatement costs (Limmeechokchai et al. 2009). \n36 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nIn Thailand, the main obstacles to promoting decoupling for economic development and low-\ncarbon emissions relate to technologies and behavioral changes.6 \n2.5  Government Strategies for Private Sector Inclusion \nThe Government of Thailand directed the policies, strategies, and measures to include the \nprivate sector in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Private involvement in greenhouse gas \nemissions reduction is witnessed in the improvement of energy efficiency and the development \nof renewable energy. The Revolving Fund, ESCO Fund, and SPP and VSPP programs are the \nkey milestones for private sector inclusion for greenhouse gas emissions reduction because the \nenergy and power sector has never before had such deep participation from the private sector. \nCommercial banks, energy service companies, and investors (in renewable energy and energy \nefficiency) are included in implementation mechanisms for greenhouse gas mitigation. \nIt should be noted that voluntary implementation of greenhouse gas emissions reduction can be \neffective. For example, the Energy Efficiency Label and CDM are voluntary measures that \ninvolve the private sector and are effective in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. It is also \nnoted that financial incentives may play a crucial role in the effectiveness and success of the \nmeasures implemented in the private sector.  \nThe other thing to note is that the private sector is very effective in implementing renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency projects. As soon as there are windows of opportunity, the private \nsector will initiate renewable energy and energy efficiency works to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. \n2.6  Major Strengths and Weakness of Current Policy Actions and \nStrategies \nThe following are the strengths and weaknesses of current key policies and plans pertaining to \nrenewable energy, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. \n2.6.1  Overview of Strengths \n2.6.1.1  Comprehensive Plans and Actions for Addressing Renewable Energy and Energy \nEfficiency \nSeveral factors have been taken into account in formulating renewable energy and energy \nefficiency  plans.  Several  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  availability  of  potentials  and \nresources.  These  results  were  incorporated  into  the  formulation  of  renewable  energy  and \nenergy efficiency plans. \nOne of the fundamental factors that can promote the decoupling of economic development and \ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction is the utilization of local and abandoned resources. It is \nevident that renewable energy and energy efficiency plans acknowledged the availability of local \nand abandoned resources, such as using agricultural biomass for producing energy, using oil \npalm and sugar cane for producing biofuels, and using municipal wastes and animal wastes for \ngenerating biogas. \n                                                \n6 \nThese obstacles are elaborated upon in Section 2.6.2. \n37 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.6.1.2  Innovative Measures \nThe Government of Thailand has adopted a number of innovative measures to promote the \ndevelopment and utilization of renewable energy and energy efficiency. These include financial \nincentives,  fiscal  incentives,  direct  subsidies,  and  barrier  removal  for  the  deployment  of \nenvironmentally  friendly  technologies.  Some  measures  can  eliminate  financial  barriers  and \nreduce  other  concerns  for  investors  and  entrepreneurs  with  regard  to  the  promotion  of \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency. \n2.6.1.3  Public\u2013Private Partnership \nThe government policies and strategies allow the private sector to take charge in implementing \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency measures. For renewable energy, SPPs and VSPPs, \nwhere private investors can invest in the power generation industry and supply electricity to the \nElectricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT),  are  clear  examples  of  public\u2013private \npartnership. In the case of energy conservation and efficiency, the Revolving Fund and ESCO \nFund, where investors and commercial banks participate in developing renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency projects, are explicit forms of public\u2013private partnership. With such an active \nprivate sector role, the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency will be further \nadvanced. \n2.6.2  Overview of Weaknesses \n2.6.2.1  Lack of Financial Incentives \nEven though a number of incentives are provided for renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects,  they  may  not  overcome  the  financial  investment  of  some  projects,  where  the \ninvestment cost is very high. Wind energy and solar energy are examples of renewable energy \nprojects where this applies. \n2.6.2.2  Need for Resource Management  \nA conflict over resource use is a concern for promoting renewable energy. Local resources and \nabandoned  materials  can  become  valuable  when  there  are  increasing  demands  for  such \nresources. Additionally, some resources can be utilized for many purposes; e.g., rice husks are \na common agricultural residue in Thailand, and they can be used for electricity generation for \nthe cement industry and for agricultural activities. Such a situation can create a conflict for the \nresources. As a result, it is essential for concerned parties to plan and manage resource \nutilization. \n2.6.2.3  Lack of Cooperation and Aggregation of Fragmented Efforts \nFrom time to time, mitigation actions and projects have been implemented in one geographic \narea  by  several  groups.  Some  of  these  activities  and  program  have  the  same  goal  and \nobjective, but they are implemented by different groups. In this situation, there may be overlap \nof the work and conflicts among the implementation groups. For effective implementation in \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, there should be cooperation among all groups carrying out \nthe activities. This can be achieved by drafting a clear plan and targets with the involvement of \nall stakeholders. \n2.6.2.4  Low Civil Society Involvement \nIt is noticeable that greenhouse gas reduction policies and actions concerning civil society are \nmostly awareness rising and promotional campaigns. These measures and actions do not \n38 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \ncreate a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emission from civil society. As a result, it is \ndifficult to set a clear target for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and to actually reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Thus, it may be useful to consider the policies and measures to \npromote greenhouse gas reductions among civil society by involving people at a deeper level. \nProviding incentives (such as providing financial incentives for reducing electricity consumption) \nand  facilitating  environmentally  friendly  behaviors  (placing  recycling  points  close  to \ncommunities) are some examples of deeper engagement with civil society. \n2.6.2.5  Inconsistent Policy Implementation \nSeveral  well-planned  policies  and  programs  are  implemented  and  provide  many  benefits. \nHowever, sometimes these policies and programs are interrupted during implementation by \npolitical issues. Low political stability is one cause of inconsistent policy implementation in \nThailand.  For  example,  a  policy  of  the  former  government  may  be  altered,  modified,  or \ndiscontinued by the new government. \n2.6.3  Weaknesses at Sector and Subnational Levels \n2.6.3.1  Energy and Power Sector \nLow Level of Research and Development \nThe level of R&D in new renewable energy technologies in Thailand is still low. This is a major \nobstacle  to  promoting  renewable  energy  in  the  country;  most  technologies  have  to  be \ntransferred from other countries. The cost for such technologies, such as solar, is also high, \ncausing  problems  for  deployment.  Additionally,  some  imported  technologies,  such  as  for \nbiomass and biogas, may not be completely suitable to Thailand (they may not give high \nefficiency). \nInsufficient Incentive to Invest in Small and Very Small Power Producers \nCurrently, SPP and VSPP programs provide a number of incentives for investment in renewable \nenergy, including the adder costs. However, technologies for some types of renewable energy \nhave  relatively  high  investment  costs  compared  to  the  benefits.  As  a  result,  private \nentrepreneurs have little interest in investing in such projects, leaving only government agencies \nto make the investments. \nLow Local Community Engagement and Incentives \nWhen establishing renewable energy power plants it is important to have the agreement of local \npeople in the area to proceed with the project. A common method used to gain access to the \narea is public hearing (during the environmental impact assessment process), but these may \nnot be sufficient for local people to agree to build the project. Thus, it may be useful to increase \nthe engagement (such as forming a committee for the project) and to provide incentives (such \nas free electricity) for local communities. \n2.6.3.2  Building Sector \nLow Awareness of Green Building  \nGreen building awareness is still low in Thailand. Most entrepreneurs of designated buildings \nonly concern themselves with energy efficiency and energy management in buildings, and do \nnot  pay  attention  to  other  aspects  of  green  buildings,  such  as  building  maintenance. \nFurthermore, entrepreneurs of nondesignated buildings are barely concerned about energy \nefficiency and energy management. \n39 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nNo Green Building Concept for Small Buildings and Condominiums  \nThe green building concept for new large buildings and new homes has developed and been \nmodified over the years to suit Thailand\u2019s climate. Experience gained from applying the green \nbuilding concept to large buildings can be used when constructing new large buildings, but the \ngreen building concept and guidelines for small buildings and residential complexes have yet to \nbe developed. Thus, it is difficult for entrepreneurs to apply green building concepts to small \nbuildings. \n2.6.3.3  Transport Sector \nLow Price Difference between Gasoline and Gasohol \nA change in fuel price in Thailand in mid-August 2011 due to a policy change (tax being \ncollected for the Oil Fund) saw the price gap between gasoline 91 and gasohol 91 reduced from \nB7.80 per liter to B3.03 per liter (PTT 2011). This change may affect biofuel consumption. With \nthe smaller price difference, people may turn to gasoline instead of gasohol.  \nPriority for Transport Policy \nPrivate vehicle ownership is driven by economic growth. If there is high economic growth in \ncoming years, there will be more private vehicles on the road (more motorcycles and higher shift \nfrom owning motorcycles to private cars), which will continue to cause traffic problems and air \npollution, and consume fuel. Thus, it is essential for the government to prioritize its public and \nnonmotorized transport policies (Pongthanaisawan and Sorapipatana 2010). \n2.6.3.4  Agriculture Sector \nLack of Local Climate Change Information \nThere is insufficient climate change data to be utilized for agricultural planning. As a result, \nagriculture planning with regard to the changing environment and climate cannot be done, \nespecially for suitable plantation area, type of crops or plants, agricultural product storage, and \nwater movement and reservoirs. Additionally, without the ability to project future climate change \nscenarios for agriculture, technology transfer for agriculture cannot properly be initiated. \nLack of Clear Agricultural Planning Concerning Food versus Fuel \nBecause fertile land is limited, it is important to have an agricultural plan in terms of what crops \nto plant, where to plant them, and how large the plantation area for each crop or plant should \nbe. The concern about land availability is intensified by the production of biofuel. Most biofuel \ntechnologies being used in Thailand are first-generation technologies, which require the use of \nfood crops and plants (e.g., oil palm and sugar cane). Currently, the planning issues concerning \nfood versus fuel have not yet been clearly addressed.  \n2.6.3.5  Waste Sector \nLack of Understanding between Government Agencies and Local Communities on Municipal \nWaste Reutilization \nIn addition to the issue of waste management (recycling rate and waste generation rate), \nreutilization of municipal waste remains a problem. One obstacle is that there is a lack of \nunderstanding  of  waste  reutilization  between  local  government  and  local  communities. \nCurrently, local people are concerned by the potential impacts of waste reutilization projects; as \na result, they do not want to have such projects near their communities. Without clearly ensuring \nthe impacts issues are addressed and ensuring that local people understand the purposes and \nbenefits of the development, municipal waste reutilization projects cannot be established. It \n40 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nshould be noted that good governance and transparent public participation are required during \nproject initiation. \n2.6.3.6  Low-Carbon City \nLack of Stakeholder Involvement in Low-Carbon City Models \nMost of the implementation for low-carbon cities in Thailand involves only a few stakeholders in \nthe  city.  This  type  of  implementation  can  be  easily  achieved;  however,  the  magnitude  of \nsuccess  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  may  not  be  high,  and  these  low-carbon \nactivities  may  be  unsustainable  because  they  lack  cooperation  and  involvement  of  all \nstakeholders. \n2.7  Major Challenges in Technology Resource Mobilization and \nPrivate and Public Finance \n2.7.1  Technology and Resource Mobilization \n2.7.1.1  Low Level of Research and Development \nIn Thailand, the level of research and development for new clean and green technologies in \nrenewable energy, energy efficiency, and other areas concerning climate change is low. Most \nclean  and  green  technologies,  especially  sophisticated  technologies,  are  deployed  in  the \ncountry  through  technology  transfer.  Deploying  clean  and  green  technologies  from  other \ncountries has high costs and, as a result, the deployment rate is low. This is because small and \nmedium-sized enterprises have financial difficulty in deploying such technologies. \nThe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is an effective mechanism that can reduce the \nbarriers to deploying clean and green technologies. However, the technologies that can be \nfacilitated through the CDM are limited, as only technologies of a certain type and scale can be \ntransferred through the CDM. \n2.7.1.2  Mobilization of Clean and Green Technologies for Commercial Purposes \nSome  research  and  development  activities  for  clean  and  green  technologies  are  being \ndomestically undertaken on a pilot scale. These technologies have the potential to alleviate \nenvironmental problems and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, some fail to be \nadopted commercially because manufacturers do not see the market potential (do not create \nthe  supply)  and  government  agencies  do  not  promote  and  support  the  emergence  of \ntechnologies (do not create the demand). \n2.7.2  Private and Public Finance \n2.7.2.1  Public Finance \nPublic finance is the primary financial source for supporting green and low-carbon development \nin Thailand. The Energy Conservation Promotion Fund (ENCON Fund) is the key public finance \nsupport for government agencies, state enterprises, nongovernment organizations, individuals, \nand  businesses  in  implementing  energy  conservation,  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy \ndevelopment,  energy-related  technology  development,  human  resource  development  and \ntraining, and public awareness campaigns. \nThe ENCON Fund was established in 1992 with an initial budget of B1.5 billion. The primary \nsources of revenue for the fund are petroleum taxes, bank interest, and irregular government \n41 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nand private budgets. Since the establishment of the fund, the budget has been allotted to \nfacilitate the implementation of programs and activities under the ENCON program, such as \nenergy conservation and efficiency, renewable energy development, technology demonstration, \nresearch and development for technologies, and raising awareness.  \nUnder the ENCON program, during 2005\u20132007 energy conservation and efficiency activities to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  energy  consumption  in  the  industry,  building,  commercial  and \nresidential, transport, and government office sectors created energy savings of about 1,554 \nktoe/year, and renewable energy promotion activities created renewable energy substitution of \ncrude oil of about 3,586 ktoe/year. These activities created savings of about B95.79 billion \n(EPPO 2008). \nSince the establishment of the ENCON Fund, the actual spending budget of the ENCON \nprogram for developing renewable energy and improving energy efficiency has been lower than \nthe estimated budget. This is because the implemented renewable energy and energy efficiency \nactivities have also been less than estimated. As a result, the key challenge regarding public \nfunding is to fully utilize the budget of the ENCON program to improve the implementation of \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency activities. \nThe budget of the ENCON Fund to execute such energy- and environment-related activities was \nestimated  at  B19.21  billion  (approximately  equivalent  to  $620  million)  during  2007\u20132011 \n(ENCON Fund 2011). \n2.7.2.2  Private Finance \nThe role of the private sector in supporting the development of green and low-carbon initiatives \nis perceived from the emergence of private finance. Currently, the Revolving Fund and ESCO \nFund are public\u2013private partnerships for promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in \nThailand. \nRevolving Fund \nAs part of the government's initiate to involve the private sector in terms of finance, the public\u2013\nprivate partnership between the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency \n(DEDE) and private financial institutions was established in 2003 with the Revolving Fund for \npromoting energy conservation and efficiency, and renewable energy. The fund provides loans \nwith a maximum fixed interest rate of 4% over 7 year with a grace period of not more than 12 \nmonths.  The  maximum  lending  amount  is  B50  million.  In  general,  the  ratio  for  financial \ncontribution  for  the  lending  amount  is  1:1  between  the  government  agency  and  the  bank \n(Sutabutr 2010). \nThe Revolving Fund is an effective program in terms of creating private finance for investing in \nenergy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects,  creating  energy  and  fuel  savings,  and \ngenerating financial savings. In the first phase of the Revolving Fund, participation of financial \ninstitutes was limited to six banks. In the second and third phases, participation increased to 11 \nparticipating financial institutions (Asawutmangkul 2010).  \nAdditionally,  the  budget  of  the  Revolving  Fund  has  been  continuously  allocated  from  the \nENCON Fund. The cumulative budget being allotted to the Revolving Fund is currently more \nthan B7 billion (DEDE 2011b), and the ratio of private finance in the fund program has increased \nsteadily over the years (Table 2.15).  \n42 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nTable 2.15: Financial Details of Revolving Fund \nPeriod \nEnergy \nConser- Energy \nvation 3  Conservat\nEnergy  Energy  Renew- ion 3  Energy  Energy \nConser- Conser- able  (Addition- Conser- Conser-\nvation 1  vation 2  energy 1  al)  vation 4  vation 5 \n30/1/2003  17/3/2006  2/8/2007  2/8/2007  2/9/2009  1/6/2010 \nto   to   to   to   to  to  \nDetails  29/1/2006  6/3/2009  1/8/2010  1/8/2010  1/9/2012  31/5/2013  Total \nApproved project  78  85  81  23  11  2  280 \nInvestment cost (B  3,427  3,536  3,812  2,576  1,272  20  14,643 \nmillion) \nBudget size of the  2,000  2,000  2,000  942.5  400  500  7,842.5 \nfund (B million) \nApproved budget for  1,902  1,805  1,988  865  383  20  6,963 \nenergy efficiency and \nrenewable energy  \nprojects (million Baht) \nBanks\u2019 lending  1,525  1,731  1,824  1,711  889  0  7,680 \namount (B million) \nElectricity saving  251  232  301  219  103  2  1,108 \n(million kilowatt-hours \n/yr) \nFuel saving (million  81  88  36  21  5  0.2  231.2 \nliter/yr) \nTotal financial saving  1,394  1,415  1,092  751  302  7  4,961 \n(B million/yr) \nReduction of  97.60  102.45  59.27  38.74  13.21  0.37  311.64 \nimported crude oil \n(thousand tons of oil \nequivalent/yr) \nNote: The data are as of October 2011 \nSource: Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency 2011b.  \nIt can clearly be seen that there are interesting benefits from the Revolving Fund in terms of \nenergy and fuel savings, and financial savings. As of September 2010, it is estimated that the \nRevolving Fund, with total investment B14.64 billion (both government and private finances), \ncan reduce the import of crude oil by 311.6 ktoe per year and can generate financial savings of \nB4.97 billion per year (DEDE 2011b). \nInterestingly, the Revolving Fund program can prompt financial institutions to create lending \nprograms for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects (interest rates are negotiable). It \nis estimated that the lending amount from financial institutions is about B70 billion (Sutabutr \n2010).  \nESCO Fund \nThe ESCO Fund is a government co-investment scheme to support ESCOs and other investors \nin investing in clean energy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and building retrofit projects. \nThe support is categorized into equity investment, venture capital investment, carbon credit \ntrading,  equipment  leasing,  technical  assistance,  and  credit  guarantee.  The  fund  was \nestablished in 2008 with an initial budget of B500 million from the ENCON Fund. The Energy for \nEnvironment  Foundation  and  the  Energy  Conservation  Foundation  of  Thailand  are  fund \nmanagers. \n43 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nDuring the implementation period of 2009\u20132010, B527.08 million was invested in 39 energy \nefficiency and renewable energy projects, with total investment of B5.11 billion. These energy \nefficiency and renewable energy projects can create energy savings of 20.61 ktoe/year and \nfinancial savings of B721.36 million per year (DEDE 2011c). \nIn short, it can be seen that the public and private financial mechanism to promote energy \nefficiency  and  renewable  energy  begins  to  work  when  there  is  deeper  participation  from \nfinancial  institutions  (more  institutions  and  larger  lending  amounts)  and  environmental  and \nfinancial benefits from the programs. However, challenges for private finance for green and low-\ncarbon development remains, one of the key ones being creating green finance for other \nenvironmental  improvements.  Currently,  low-interest  loans  for  green  and  low-carbon \nimprovements (other than energy efficiency and renewable energy) are offered by only one \nfinancial institution, Krungthai Bank, which received financial support from the Environmental \nFund of the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning. The challenge, \ntherefore, is for concerned agencies and financial institutions to create green soft loans for \nentrepreneurs, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, for investing in environmental \nimprovement programs.  \n3.  ACHIEVING LOW-CARBON GREEN ASIA 2050  \n3.1  The Role of Lifestyle Choices, National Innovation Systems and \nTechnology Transfer, and Market-Based Instruments in Achieving \nVoluntary Targets, and the Costs Involved \nIn the past several years, numerous initiatives and activities have been implemented to mitigate \ngreenhouse gas emissions in Thailand. Because Thailand is a non-Annex I party to the Kyoto \nProtocol, all mitigation actions are taken voluntarily, with the aim of being part of the global \naction in reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions and alleviating the impacts of climate \nchange. \nWhile there is no clear voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction target in Thailand, it has \nbeen recognized that it is crucial for all nations to undertake greenhouse gas mitigation. As a \nresult, the Government of Thailand and other sectors have initiated a number of initiatives and \nactions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, emissions reduction in regards to \ngreen lifestyle, national systems and technology transfer, and market-based instruments is still \nin the initial stage of development. \n3.1.1  Green Consumer and Lifestyle\u2014Emerging Yet? \nWhen discussing green consumers and lifestyle choices, there are many consumption practices \ninvolved\u2014food consumption, travel mode choices, and leisure practices (Spaargaren 2003). All \nof these practices contribute to greenhouse gas emissions to varying degrees. Within each \npractice, there are choices for consumers, and each choice has different greenhouse gas \nemission implications. For example, a person going to the office by personal car may cause \nhigher greenhouse gas emissions than someone taking public transport. In general, it is well \nunderstood that green products and services have less environmental impacts (they may cause \nless greenhouse gas emissions).  \nIn Thailand, green consumers and lifestyles are the key challenges for reaching sustainable \ndevelopment. Green products and services have been increasing in recent years, but the green \nmarket  in  Thailand  is  still  limited  because  there  are  few  green  consumers  who  consider \n44 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nenvironmental factors when making purchases (Pollution Control Department [PCD] 2006). Thai \nconsumers are price-sensitive consumers, and the prices of green products are higher than \nthose of non-green products. \nDespite a low number of green consumers, there are signs of increasing awareness in terms of \nfood consumption. Organic food is becoming a viable green movement in Thailand. This green \nmovement is active in engaging both green producers and green consumers, and in providing \ninformation  to  consumers.7  Additionally,  retail  shops  selling  organic  products  and  healthy \nproducts in Thailand are increasing. The government, as the largest consumer in the nation, has \nenforced a green procurement policy with the hope of increasing the demand for green products \nand services (PCD 2006). All government agencies are obligated to comply with the green \nprocurement policy. \nThe emergence of green food consumers and demand for green products and services created \nby the government forecasts a promising future for an increase in green consumers and green \nconsumption in Thailand. However, there may be a need for the government and private sector \nto  further  implement  measures  to  create  green  demands  from  consumers.  This  could  be \naddressed by using both short-term and long-term measures, e.g., providing incentives for \npurchasing  green  products  and  services  (short  term)  or  providing  education  and  raising \nawareness (long term).  \n3.1.1  National Innovation Systems and Technology Transfer \n3.1.1.1  National Innovation System \nEnergy Efficiency Label (Energy Label No.5) \nEnergy Label No.5 is an interesting innovation to promote energy efficiency in the residential \nsector in Thailand. As a demand-side management (DSM) program, Energy Label No.5, which \nwas started in 1991, is the key program undertaken by the Electricity Generating Authority of \nThailand (EGAT). This label program is free and voluntary\u2014appliance producers do not need to \npay to participate in the program. The program's key objectives are to (i) encourage producers \nto manufacture and/or import energy efficient products, (ii) provide energy efficient products to \nend users, (iii) educate people about energy and energy efficiency, and (iv) efficiently utilize \nenergy in the country.  \nThe program uses a label (efficiency scale range from No.1 to No.5, with No.5 being the highest \nefficiency level) to communicate to consumers about energy efficiency, energy consumption, \nand electricity cost information of appliances (the details of the label for each appliance may \ndiffer from one to another, but the key message to consumers is the same\u2014energy efficiency of \nthe  appliance).  The  program  began  labeling  a  few  high-energy-use  home  appliances\u2014\nrefrigerators and air conditioners\u2014by running commercial campaigns promoting the label to the \npublic and providing details of financial benefits that consumers could get from using certified \nproducts. As a consequence of the promotion and campaign, the label is highly recognized \namong Thai people, and end-users tend to select products that have high efficiency. With an \nactive demand-side movement, producers have improved the energy efficiency of products to \ngain the trust of end-users and increase sales (Na Phuket and Prijyanonda 2000). The program \nis successful and EGAT has expanded the program to cover a broad range of home appliances. \nAdditionally, EGAT periodically rescales the certification criteria of Energy Label No.5 for each \nproduct,  and  appliance  producers  keep  pace  with  the  tightening  energy  efficiency  criteria, \nresulting in increased appliance efficiency.  \n                                                \n7\n An example of a green network is Thaigreenmarket. http://www.thaigreenmarket.com/ \n45 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nAs a result of this dynamic between EGAT, appliance producers, and end-users, the successful \nprogram has generated multiple benefits, the key ones being the level of energy efficiency of \nproducts,  energy  and  financial  savings,  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Energy \nsavings  are  a  result  of  the  use  of  high-energy-efficient  products  nationwide.  This reduces \nelectricity demand and the need to construct new power plants. With reduced energy demand, \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  from  energy  production  and  consumption  are  simultaneously \nreduced by the label program. Box 3 shows the implementation and key implementation results \nof the label program. \n \nBox 3: Case Study: Energy Efficiency Label (Energy Label No.5) \nImplementation: \n\uf06c  The label is part of a demand-side management program to reduce energy consumption \nof high energy consumption products.  \n\uf06c  Certification began with a few products and expanded to a wider range of products \ncovering refrigerators, air conditioners, compact fluorescent lamps, ballasts, electric fans, \nrice cookers, electric lamps, electric water boilers, televisions, and monitors.  \n\uf06c  The program is very effective as it is promoted through TV campaigns that inform about \nthe savings that can be realized when using energy efficient appliances. This creates \nhigh recognition among end users. Consequently, people tend to purchase certified (high \nefficiency) appliances, with the result that producers improve the energy efficiency of \nproducts. \nKey results and implications: \n\uf06c  The World Bank estimated that the use of energy efficiency lighting, refrigerators, \nand air conditioners (Energy Efficient Label) as a result of the program has reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 12.6\u201317.4 MtCO eq during 1993\u20132004 and additional \n2\n14.7\u201327.6 MtCO eq during 2005\u20132010 (World Bank 2006). \n2\n\uf06c  As of February 2007, energy savings from certified refrigerators and air conditioners \n(highest efficiency label) are estimated at 1,000 megawatts.  \n\uf06c  As  of  February  2007,  greenhouse  gas  emission  reductions  created  by  certified \nrefrigerators and air conditioners (highest efficiency label) are estimated at 4 MtCO eq. \n2\nGreenhouse \nEnergy saving \nGas \nEmissions \nReduction \nNumber of  (Tons of \nProduct  issued labels  GWh  MW  CO eq) \n2\nAir Conditioners  18,272,449  2,416.0  254.2  1,763,799 \nRefrigerators  5,995,192  3,278.5  743.4  2,195,029 \nSource: EGAT 2009a, 2009b \n\uf06c  People recognize the label and consider the label when purchasing electrical appliances. \n\uf06c  Manufacturers can continuously improve energy efficiency of products to meet with the \ntightening criteria of the label, which are rescaled approximately every 5 years.  \nMtCO eq = million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \n2\n   \n46 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nSmall Power Producer and Very Small Power Producer Program \nThe SPP and VSPP program is an innovative system to stimulate the utilization of renewable \nenergy in Thailand. Reform of the power sector started in 1992 with the introduction of the \nPurchase Power from Small Power Producers (SPP) Regulation. The regulation allows private \ncompanies to be a part of the national power supply. The Independent Power Producers (IPPs) \nprogram (for large power producers) is a beginning point that brings private investment to power \ngeneration activity, which can be viewed as a starting point of the SPP and VSPP program. \nInitially, the SPP and VSPP program was ineffective and underwent several changes to  policy, \nfinancial and investment systems, institutional conditions, and economic situation. Only recently \nhas  the  SPP  and  VSPP  program  provided  significant  contributions  to  the  development  of \nrenewable energy, enhancement of energy security, and structure of the power sector. \nThe fundamental concept of the SPP and VSPP program is to provide more practical and more \ninvestor-friendly regulations by modifying criteria for qualifying as a facility, calculation of the \navoided cost, and interconnection requirements. The details of the current SPP and VSPP \nprogram are as follows: \n1.  Cogeneration facilities are applicable to the SPP and VSPP program. The power that can \nbe sold from the facility is 10\u201390 MW for SPPs and not more than 10 MW for VSPPs. \n2.  SPP cogeneration facilities can have a long-term contract for selling power to the grid.  \n3.  The feed-in tariff for SPPs and VSPPs using renewable energy is increased. An adder is \nprovided over the normal tariff rate for SPPs and VSPPs that use renewable energy with \nthe duration of 7\u201310 years (from the commercial operation date). Table 3.1 shows the adder \nprovided to SPPs and VSPPs. \n4.  Soft loans and investment subsidy for selected types of renewable energy covers biogas \nfrom  pig  farms,  tapioca  starch  factories,  palm  oil  factories,  rubber  factories,  ethanol \nfactories, other agro-industry factories, municipal waste, and micro-hydro. \n5.

For the \ncurrent SPP and VSPP program, lucrative and long-term financial incentives are provided \nand have been the key factor in overcoming the financial constraint on investing in \nrenewable energy projects. Adder is the incentive that most catches investor attention, \nespecially for VSPP investors. Furthermore, other financial incentives, including the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism, also contribute to financial feasibility, resulting in the rapid \nestablishment of numerous SPP and VSPP projects.  \n  SPP and VSPP reclassification \no\nBefore the current SPP and VSPP program came into force, the allowance for selling \npower from SPP and VSPP projects could not exceed 90 MW for SPPs and 1 MW for \nVSPPs. Consequently, there were few VSPP projects as the allowance was too small to \ngain any financial return. The new policy has increased the VSPP limit to up to 10 MW, \nresulting in the emergence of more VSPP projects. \n  Technical assistance and other assistance to reduce technological risks \no\nSPP and VSPP projects are directly associated with small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs); most of the entrepreneurs participating in SPP and VSPP projects are from \nSMEs. SMEs lack technical knowledge and experience, especially in the energy business, \nand this causes technological difficulties for investors. Providing technical assistance and \nadvice,  and  other  assistance,  throughout  project  implementation  can  help  enhance \ninvestor confidence, resulting in reduced technological risks.  \n \n \n3.1.1.2  Technologies and Technology Transfer \n \nThrough several government organizations and research institutes, Thailand has invested in \nresearch  and  development  activities  pertaining  to  greenhouse  gas  mitigation,  especially \nresearch  and  development  for  second-  and  third-generation  renewable  energy  and  new \n49 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \ntechnologies for energy efficiency. However, technological research and development has not \nyet led to such technologies being used on a commercial scale; further development is required. \nFurthermore, it is essential to commercialize such technologies so that they can be used for \nmitigating greenhouse gas emissions. \nCurrent  policies  in  Thailand  are  conducive  to  the  transfer  of  environmentally  sound \ntechnologies,  and  a  number  of  barriers  have  been  eliminated  by  reducing  import  duties, \nreducing corporate taxes, and providing subsidies. Additionally, the implementation of CDM \nprojects  has  a  significant  level  of  technology  transfer  and  has  brought  advanced \nenvironmentally sound technologies to the country. The higher level of technology transfer may \nresult from approval criteria of CDM projects, tariffs on imported equipment (lower or exempt), \nand other factors (Seres 2008). \n3.1.2  Market-Based Instruments for Pollution Control and Environmental \nImprovement \n3.1.2.1  Economic Instruments \nAlthough there  has  been  enforcement  of  environmental regulations (command  and  control \napproach) in Thailand since the early 1990s, there has still been environmental degradation, \nespecially water quality (PCD 2009). The \"polluter pays\" principle is seen as a way to effectively \nsolve  environmental  problems.  The  government  has  developed  the  Act  on  Economic \nInstruments  for  Environmental  Management  as  an  economic  instrument  for  solving \nenvironmental pollution problems and improving environmental quality; however, as of October \n2011 the act had not been introduced. \nBased on the current structure of economic instruments in Thailand, the draft Act on Economic \nInstruments for Environmental Management will serve as an overall framework for all economic \ninstruments used for environmental protection and improvement. Under the act (based on the \nmost  current  draft),  there  are  five  proposed  decrees  covering  five  areas  of  environmental \nmanagement\u2014water  pollution,  air  pollution,  electronic  wastes  and  used  products,  CO  \n2\nemissions from vehicles, and tourism. The proposed economic instruments for these five areas \nare pollution taxes, service charges, product taxes and fees, performance bonds, tradable \npermits,  and  environmental  subsidies.  Currently,  the  draft  act  and  decrees  are  under \nconsideration for approval of the Cabinet and the Council of State (some decrees are approved \nby the Cabinet and under review of the Council of State). \nIt  can  be  expected  that,  if  economic  instruments  (under  the  decrees)  are  successfully \nintroduced,  there  will  be  significant  environmental  management  and  remediation  impacts, \nincluding reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The act also aims to introduce the allocation of \ngreenhouse gas caps. Additionally, the revenues collected from pollution taxes will be used to \nimprove  environmental  management  and  pollution  treatment,  which  will  contribute  to  the \nmitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. \n3.1.2.2  Carbon Trading Scheme \nIn addition to the upcoming economic instruments for environmental protection and remediation, \nother market-based instruments are under consideration in Thailand. The Thailand Greenhouse \nGas Management Organization (TGO) has an initiative to establish the Thailand Voluntary \nEmission  Trading  Scheme  (TVETS)  and  Thailand  Voluntary  Emission  Reduction  (T-VER) \nscheme in order to intensify voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts as a non-\nAnnex I party.  The establishment of these schemes is still at an early stage. \n50 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nIf the TVETS and T-VER schemes are established and functioning, it should be possible to \nobtain systematic and comprehensive data on voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction, \nand witness significant greenhouse gas emissions reduction in several sectors in the country \nthrough  renewable  energy  utilization;  energy  saving  and  efficiency;;  and  afforestation, \nreforestation, and/or forest conservation activities.  \n3.2  Positioning National Actions within the Current Global Climate \nRegime and Regional Cooperation Framework \nSufficiency Economy Philosophy \nThe  Sufficiency  Economy  Philosophy  was  bestowed  on  Thai  people  by  His  Majesty  King \nBhumibol Adulyadej. In 1999, the formal interpretation of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy \nwas made by the Sufficiency Economy Working Group and was approved by the king. In \naccordance with the formal definition, Sufficiency Economy has four key elements: \nSufficiency Economy is an approach to life and conduct which is applicable at every level \nfrom the individual through the family and community to the management and development \nof the nation. \nIt stresses a middle path, especially in developing the economy to keep up with the world in \nthe era of globalization. \nSufficiency has three components: moderation, reasonableness, and the need for built-in \nresilience against the risks which arise from internal or external change.  \nIn addition, the application of theories in planning and implementation requires great care \nand good judgment at every step. At the same time, all members of the nation \u2013 especially \npublic officials, academics, and business people \u2013 need to develop their commitment to the \nimportance  of  knowledge,  integrity,  and  honesty,  and  to  conduct  their  lives  with \nperseverance, tolerance, wisdom, and insight, so that the country has the strength and \nbalance  to  respond  to  the  rapid  and  widespread  changes  in  economy,  society, \nenvironment, and culture in the world. (Wibulswasdi, Piboolsavut, and Pootrakool 2010: 1) \nSince the 8th National Economic and Social Development Plan (1997\u20132002), the Sufficiency \nEconomy Philosophy has been adopted as a guiding principle for national development. The \nkey elements of the philosophy have also been integrated into the 11th National Economic and \nSocial Development Plan (2012\u20132016). \nFrom the national position and policy regarding the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, it can be \nseen  that  Thailand  is  pursuing  a  balanced  development  path,  taking  economic,  societal, \nenvironmental, and cultural factors at the local, national, regional, and global levels into account. \nThis can be clearly interpreted as an indication that Thailand is seriously considering global \nenvironmental changes as a key factor in determining national development. Thus, the national \nposition of Thailand is in line with the current global climate regime and regional cooperation on \nclimate change. \nSuch  a  position  ensures  that  multiple  and  co-benefit  policies  and  actions  for  mitigating \ngreenhouse gas emissions will be considered for implementation. Additionally, no-regret and \nleast-cost policies and actions on greenhouse gas emissions reduction, which do not have \nsignificant negative impacts on the economy and society, can be expected. \n51 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n3.3  Trade and Investment Links with Other Asian Economies \nThailand promotes international trade and investment for environmental goods and services. In \nterms of trade and investment in environmental goods, the Board of Investment and other \ngovernment agencies provide extensive incentive packages to promote investment in renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency and environmentally friendly trade of goods and services. For \ninvestment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, there are both nontax and tax incentives, \nsuch as corporate income tax exemption, and import tax exemption for technologies. \nFor trade and investment in environmental services, Thailand made commitments under the \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) on environmental services. The current status \nof environmental service is seen as \"no restriction\" (liberalized) for market access and national \ntreatment  under  cross-border  supply  and  consumption  abroad,  and  as  \"partial  restriction\" \n(partially liberalized) for market access and national treatment under commercial presence8 \n(Yoko and Okuda 2000). \n3.4  Major Constraints on Regional Cooperation, and Solutions \n3.4.1  Global Regimes  \nThailand is in the process of drafting nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) and a \nmeasurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system. Significant progress has been made in \ndeveloping NAMAs because some assistance has been received. Japan, via the Institute for \nGlobal  Environment  Research  and  Pacific  Consultant,  in  cooperation  with  Thailand's \nGreenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) conducted a feasibility study of NAMAs for \nwaste management (Ministry of the Environment of Japan and Global Environment Centre \nFoundation 2011). The development of NAMAs is nearing completion, and it is likely that the \nfirst of them will soon be submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange). Drafting of the domestic MRV system is also being undertaken by the TGO and other \nrelated agencies, and significant progress has been made. \nFor  reducing  emissions  from  deforestation  and  degradation,  and  the  role  of  conservation, \nsustainable management of forest, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing \ncountries (REDD+), Thailand supports REDD+ because it is in line with the national policy for \nprotecting and conserving forests and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Srethasirote, 2011). \nFurther progress and Thailand's position on REDD+ is still being discussed and developed.  \n3.4.2  Trade and Investment in Green and Low-Carbon Products and Services \nWith the introduction of several incentives and regulations, Thailand has facilitated trade and \ninvestment in green and low-carbon products and services.  \nHowever, there are some concerns regarding the promotion of trade and investment because \nutilization in the domestic market is still limited. The use of green and low-carbon products and \nservices is associated with financial costs and benefits, and applicability of the products and \nservices to the local context. The cheaper the products and services, the more they will be \nutilized. Thus, financial incentives from the government and other agencies to promote the use \nof green and low-carbon products are essential. Financial incentives should be enough to \novercome the financial barriers and to provide reasonable benefits. Furthermore, it is important \nto  consider  the  local  contexts  for  adopting  green  and  low-carbon  products  and  services. \n                                                \n8 Commercial presence refers to service suppliers that establish, operate, or expand a commercial presence\u2014such \nas an agency, branch, subsidiary, or joint venture\u2014in another country. \n52 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nAcceptance of such products and services by people in the countries and local communities has \nto be gained before applying products and services. Thus, it is necessary to utilize acceptable \nproducts and services and/or create understanding with the local people. \n3.4.3  Institutional and Governance System \nIn Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries, the institutional and governance \nchallenge relates to the extent of cooperation and integration on climate change and green \neconomy among member countries; thus far it is not greatly in evidence\u2014the impact of climate \nchange is clearly not a priority issue. As a result, international cooperation and assistance is \nrarely  provided  to  the  region.  Furthermore,  standard  baseline  data  at  the  regional  level \nconcerning climate change and greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts and calculations are \nscattered. \n3.4.4  Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperation \nThe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) comprises six member countries\u2014five Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries (Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n[Lao PDR], Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and the People\u2019s Republic of China. One of the \nkey areas of GMS cooperation is energy. The cooperation and initiatives in the energy sector \nunder  the  GMS  are  emphasized  in  cross-border  electrical  power  trading  and transmission \nnetworks (Zhai 2010). \nUnder the GMS, Thailand has bilateral cooperation on power trade and development with \nCambodia and the Lao PDR. Thailand exports 115 kilovolts of electrical power to Cambodia \n(Zhai 2010).  \n3.4.4.1  Cooperation between Thailand and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic on Power \nDevelopment and Purchasing \nAs Thailand has to rely on imported energy and power, it has cooperated with the Lao PDR as \nthere is great potential to purchase power, especially hydropower, from the Lao PDR. As of \n2010, Thailand had power purchase agreements with the Lao PDR on six projects, five of which \nwere hydropower projects (2,082.6 MW) (Royal Thai Embassy Vientiane 2011) and the other a \nlignite project (1,473 MW) (EGAT 2011). Thailand has also signed a tariff memorandum of \nunderstanding for purchasing power from other projects in the Lao PDR. It should be noted that \nthe development of hydropower plants in the Lao PDR is assisted by the Asia Development \nBank (ADB).  \nThe use of renewable resources in the Lao PDR to generate electricity to sell to Thailand can be \nconceptualized as a regional energy hub. The purchase of power from the Lao PDR not only \nenhances energy security for Thailand (in terms of adequate energy supply and affordability) but \nalso contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of the energy and power sector. \nThe reduction of greenhouse gases originates from the nature of the power project itself, \nbecause most power projects developed in the Lao PDR use hydropower. There are also other \nadvantages for the Lao PDR, such as generating income, poverty reduction, improving quality of \nlife,  and  creating  energy  security.  However,  local  environmental  impacts  from  the  project \nconstruction remain a concern for local people and nongovernment organizations because \nenvironmental impact assessment was not comprehensive. \n3.4.4.2  The Future of Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperation in the Energy sector \nWith technical assistance from ADB, the formulation of a regional strategy for the energy sector \nin the GMS is solidified. Recently, cooperation in the energy sector was expanded by integrating \n53 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nenvironmental and social aspects into the planning and implementation of energy cooperation. \nUnder a plan to implement the GMS Energy Strategy, energy security, renewable energy, and \nenvironmentally  sound  energy  practices  are  included  for  cooperation  (Greater  Mekong \nSubregion Economic Cooperation Program 2009). Deeper cooperation with the integration of \nenvironmental concerns, especially climate change, is expected to create green and low-carbon \ndevelopment for the region and for member countries, resulting in economic growth, energy \nsecurity, and reduced environmental impacts.  \nA MARKAL-based integrated energy system model study conducted by Watcharejyothin and \nShrestha found that unrestricted energy resource development and trade within the GMS would \nprovide economic and environmental benefits for member countries (except for Myanmar). \nFurthermore, unrestricted energy resource development with reduced CO  emissions of 5% for \n2\neach  member  country  would  enhance  energy  security,  reduce  energy  imports,  lessen  the \ndependency  on  fossil  fuels,  and  increase  the  trading  volume  of  power  within  the  region \n(Watcharejyothin and Shrestha 2009). \n3.5  Major Policy Reforms in Thailand \nIn Thailand, progress on renewable energy and energy efficiency can be observed through the \ndevelopment and implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency plans. The 15-\nYear Renewable Energy Development Plan (REDP) and Energy Efficiency Improvement (under \nthe ENCON Program) are the key initiatives. These two plans consist of a number of measures, \nincluding reform measures to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in Thailand. \n3.5.1  The 15-Year Renewable Energy Development Plan \nThe 15-Year Renewable Energy Development Plan (REDP) consists of several policies creating \nincentives for renewable energy production and utilization:  \n\uf06c  Tax incentives from the Board of Investment: Tax exemptions cover import machinery \nduties and corporate tax for new investment (8 year income tax holiday and a further 5 \nyears with 50% reduced taxation). \n\uf06c  Revolving Fund: The Revolving Fund provides fixed low-interest loans at less than 4% \nwith a maximum lending amount of B50 million and a loan period of 7 years. Eligible \ninvestment  costs  are  equipment  and  installation,  consultation,  civil  works,  piping,  or \nnecessary components for the project, as well as other associated costs, such as removal \nof existing equipment, transportation, and taxes. \n\uf06c  ESCO  Fund:  This  is  a  government  co-investment  scheme  for  encouraging  private \ninvestment in renewable energy projects. The fund provides financial investment and other \nbenefits including equipment leasing, carbon credit trading, technical assistance, and a \ncredit guarantee facility. The investment term is 3\u20137 years with a mutually agreed exit \nclause. \n\uf06c  Investment grant: Grants are given to develop small renewable energy projects (biogas, \nmunicipality waste, solar hot water). The grant is provided for design, consultants, and \npartial investment, with a maximum amount of B50 million. \n\uf06c  Adder  cost: Adder is provided over the normal tariff rate for SPPs and VSPPs using \nrenewable energy, with the duration of 7\u201310 years from the commercial operation date. \n\uf06c  Other assistance: Technical assistance (such as energy maps), technology catalogues, \nand favorable regulations applicable for CDM projects are arranged. \n54 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n3.5.2  Energy Efficiency Improvement \nThe Government of Thailand adopted five reform measures to promote energy conservation \nand energy efficiency: ENCON Fund, ESCO Fund, tax incentives, direct subsidy, and DSM \nbiding. \n  \n\uf075  Revolving Fund: (For details see point 3.5.1.)  \n\uf075  ESCO Fund: (For details see point 3.5.1.)  \n\uf075  Tax incentives: There are few incentive schemes to promote the use of and investment in \nenergy efficiency projects.  \n\uf0d8  Tax incentive for energy efficiency products provides 25% tax credit from purchasing \n19 energy efficiency products (mostly certified with Energy Label No.5). This program \nwill be continued until December 2012.  \n\uf0d8  Others:  \n\uf0b2  Board of Investment tax incentive: Exemptions of corporate income tax and import \nduties with the maximum of 8 years for energy efficiency equipment manufacturers \nand ESCOs and 50% tax reduction in years 9\u201313.  \n\uf0b2  Performance-based tax incentive: Energy saving value can be claimed for income \ntax reduction (maximum tax privilege that can be claimed is B2 million). \n\uf075  Subsidy: A subsidy is provided for energy efficiency investments. The subsidy is applicable \nfor  standard  technologies  (approved  technologies),  high  technologies  (demonstrated \nenergy efficiency technologies), and individual projects (other measures and technologies). \nThe program provides a 20% direct subsidiary (of B50,000\u2013B3 million) to facilities that have \npayback periods of not more than 7 years. \n\uf075  DSM  biding:  The  program  provides  financial  support  for  investment  in  higher  energy \nefficiency machines and equipment. Proposals that have lower weighted subsidy will be the \nfirst to be subsidized. Subsidy is granted based on actual energy saving (the subsidy \namount = annual energy saving x the subsidy rate). The subsidy rate for electricity is \nB1/kWh, for heat from liquid and gas fuels it is B75 per million British thermal units (BTUs), \nand for heat from solid fuels it is B15/million BTUs. \n3.5.3  Key Lessons  \nThe success of the Revolving Fund, ESCO Fund, and adder costs (limited to some types of \nrenewable energy) has been noticeable. At the end of 2008, the Revolving Fund supported over \n240  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects  ($500  million  of  total  investment), \ngenerating energy savings of around $120 million per year (Asawutmangkul 2010); the ESCO \nFund approved 17 projects ($125 million of total investment) generating energy savings of \naround $14 million per year (Asawutmangkul 2010); and adder costs for SPPs and VSPPs \ncould generate investment for some sources of renewable energy. \nBased on these implementation results, it is clear that the private sector is ready to invest in \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy projects. However, without some positive conditions\u2014\nsuch as adequate financial and technical support to overcome investment barriers, financial \ngains generated from the investment, and favorable conditions and regulations\u2014the investment \nmight not eventuate.

Green and Low-Carbon Development \n3.6.1.1  Energy Sector Reform \nThailand  has  started  energy  sector  reform.  The  private  sector  can  participate  in  power \ngeneration activities, and renewable energy is used for generating electricity. However, the \nlevels of private participation and renewable energy utilization can be increased to improve \nenergy security, maintain economic growth, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions.  \nThe key challenge to deeper reform in the energy sector is inducing the private sector to invest \nin renewable energy development. Many incentives are being offered to the private sector, but \nthey are not enough to attract investment in solar and wind projects. Thus, it is important to \ndevelop suitable incentive options to make investment in renewable energy attractive to the \nprivate sector. \n3.6.1.2  Economic Reform \nEconomic reform is a challenging issue in Thailand. In general, environmental costs are not \ngenerally integrated into products and services because of the lack of environmental taxes. \nEnvironmental and carbon taxes are not yet effective (the [Draft] Act on Economic Instruments \nfor Environmental Management is awaiting implementation), and the economic reform needed \nto integrate environmental costs into economic and pricing systems has yet to occur.  \nHowever, when the (Draft) Act on Economic Instruments for Environmental Management comes \ninto effect, reform in the Thai economy should be clearly seen. However, this reform is expected \nto bring challenges in terms of associated costs, as the taxes will eventually affect the cost of \nproducts and services. With the increasing costs come key challenges for the domestic and \ninternational market. In the domestic market, the higher costs of products and services will \naffect low-income earners; the government must address this issue. In the international market, \nincreasing costs will affect the ability to compete with other exporting countries. This issue is \ncrucial because Thailand is a production hub for many products, such as electronics and \nappliances, agricultural and food products, and textiles. The government and industry will need \nto find solutions on international markets. \n3.6.1.3  Institutional Reform and Governance \nIn recent years Thailand has undertaken institutional and governance reform by decentralizing \npower from the central government to local governments, and having more public participation \nin  many  areas,  including  health  and  environmental  impacts.  However,  institutional  and \ngovernance  concerning  green  and  low-carbon  development  for  Thailand  persists  remains \nproblematic in terms of capacity of local governments.  \nMost  environmental  responsibilities  of  the  central  government  are  assigned  to  local \ngovernments, which manage local environmental issues. However, most local governments lack \nthe capacity and resources to manage certain environmental issues. Thus, the challenge for \nThailand is to increase the capacity of, and supply sufficient resources to, local governments so \nthat they can implement and achieve green and low-carbon development in their areas. \n3.6.1.4  Regional Cooperation  \nIn ASEAN, cooperation among member countries is expected to increase in the years to come \n(through the effectiveness of the ASEAN Economic Community [AEC]). The AEC primarily \n58 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nfocuses on the economic integration of member countries by eliminating tariffs, addressing the \nmovement  of  professionals  and  capital,  and  facilitating  customs  clearance  procedures. \nHowever, environmental concerns are not yet part of AEC cooperation. Thus, the challenge for \nregional  cooperation  around  green  and  low-carbon  issues  is  to  bring  environmental \nconsideration into the AEC system, which may not be possible in the initial stages of the AEC. \n3.6.2  Recommendations \nClimate change has been recognized as a threat to the nation and has been integrated into the \nformulation of several national plans and policies. Both the public and private sectors have been \nactively involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and a series of measures and actions \nhave been implemented in each sector to achieve this. \nDeveloping  renewable  energy  and  promoting  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  are  the \nprimary ways to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Green consumption and production, as \nwell as green lifestyle, have also been addressed but are yet to mature. The other area that has \nnot  clearly  emerged  yet  is  stakeholder  involvement  and  engagement  for  tackling  climate \nchange. Even though Thailand has made significant progress toward green and low-carbon \ndevelopment, more needs to be done. Overall, Thailand has to focus on implementing no-regret \npolicies to ensure the decoupling of the economy and the environment, while starting to looking \nfurther at implementing least-cost policies. Short-term policies should immediately address the \nissue of rapidly increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and long-term policies should address \nfundamental changes towards a green and low-carbon society. \nIn  the  short term, Thailand  needs  to  increase  the  implementation  of  its  current  promising \npolicies on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other green policies, such as SPPs and \nVSPPs, Revolving Fund, and ESCO Fund. Additionally, incentives policies should be introduced \nusing economic instruments through the market system. Policies regarding greenhouse gas \nemission reduction should allow the participation of the private sector, because the private \nsector has the abilities and is efficient in making environmental advancements. At the same \ntime, the bodies of knowledge concerning new issues, such as green building and homes, need \nto be developed.  \nIt  is  essential  for  Thailand  to  emphasize  technology  transfer  regarding  green  and  clean \ntechnologies, and regional and bilateral cooperation for developing technologies, so that the \ntechnologies can be deployed quickly and at low cost. Nevertheless, R&D into green and clean \ntechnologies, especially commercialized energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, \nshould be prioritized as it is still low in Thailand. The focus of policies on technologies should \nconcentrate not only on R&D but also on generating the demand for such technologies.  \nFor agricultural activities, policies around greenhouse gas emission reduction have not yet \ntaken  shape.  The  key  consideration  is  changing  current  agricultural  practices  to  be \nenvironmentally friendly by changing farmer behavior and introducing new technologies and \nmaterials. \nNew policy initiatives concerning greenhouse gas emissions reduction, such as green buildings \nand homes, and green islands and cities, should be further developed, and suitable concepts \nand models should be developed to fit the Thai context. The basic information and knowledge \non climate change should be developed and utilized to advance new policy initiatives.  \nFor long-term policies, the foundation of the society needs to be addressed, especially in the \npublic sector. Fundamental changes are needed in terms of environmental awareness and \nbehavior, and these issues should be addressed by integrating both environmental knowledge \nand awareness into the educational system and facilitating environmentally friendly behavior. \n59 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nIt is important to find innovative solutions to overcome the challenges being faced in each sector \n(Table 3.3). \nTable 3.3: Sector Challenges and Solutions \nSector  Challenge  Solution \nEnergy and power  Achieving 15-Year Renewable  Revise renewable energy incentives \nsector  Energy Plan \nRemove other barriers to renewable energy \nutilization for each specific source of energy \nImprove renewable resource management and \nutilization \nFinalizing the direction of power  Address the issue of nuclear power and clean \ndevelopment through the Power  coal with public participation for arriving at \nDevelopment Plan   mutual agreement for the direction of national \npower development \nDeveloping new technologies for  Research and develop into new renewable \nrenewable energy  technologies (also considering the food versus \nenergy issue) \nCooperation among developing countries for \ncommercial R&D on technologies to reduce cost \nand to develop new generation of technologies \nIndustry sector  Intensifying the utilization of  Consider the utilization of on-site renewable \nrenewable energy   energy generation technologies \nImplementation of greenhouse gas  Integrate environment rationalities into the \nemissions reduction is still limited to  industry and manufacturing sectors, especially \nlarge and medium-sized enterprises  for small enterprises \nEncourage large companies to implement \ngreening the supply chain with their small \nsuppliers \nHigh cost of technologies  Support the local production of energy efficiency \nand renewable energy technologies  \nFurther development of renewable  Consider the tax system and implement new \nenergy and energy efficiency in the  positive economic instruments, such as  \nindustry sector \n\u2022  carbon taxes (reducing taxes) for \nproducts or activities utilizing \nrenewable energy \n\u2022  financial incentives for enterprises that \ninvest in renewable energy or reduce \nenergy consumption;
