Even  though  Thailand  is  not  obligated  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  it \nvoluntarily  takes  numerous  actions  to  mitigate  emissions.  Both  the  public  and  private  sector \nhave been actively involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a series of measures \nand actions implemented in each sector. \n\nThe development of renewable energy and the promotion of energy conservation and efficiency \nare  the  primary  means  to  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  Thailand.  With  the \nestablishment  of  the  Energy  Conservation  Program  in  1995,  a  viable  movement  for  energy \nconservation  and  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  had  begun.  Over  the  years,  progress  in \nrenewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  has  been  made.  Recently,  the  15-Year  Renewable \nEnergy  Development  Plan  and  the  20-Year  Energy  Conservation  Plan  comprised  several \ninnovative measures and incentive mechanisms to further advance the development of energy \nefficiency and renewable energy. Regardless of government policies and measures, the private \nsector has also taken part in greenhouse gas emissions mitigation by implementing a number of \nactivities  to  reduce  carbon  sources  (e.g.,  improved  production  processes  and  resource \nefficiency) and to create carbon sinks (e.g., reforestation and mangrove plantations). \n\nThailand has made significant progresses toward green and low-carbon development; however, \nthere is a need to further address the issue. The country has to focus on the implementation of \nno-regret policies to ensure the decoupling of economic growth, while starting to look further at \nimplementing least-cost policies. There should be short-term policies to immediately address a \nrapid  increase  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  long-term  policies  to  address  fundamental \nchanges towards a green and low-carbon society. \n\nJEL Classification: Q54, Q58 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nContents \n\nIntroduction\n\n ..................................................................................................................... 3\n \n\n1.1  Current Economic Development and Future Emission Profiles\n1.2  Basic Indicators of Low-Carbon Green Development\n1.3 \n\n .............................. 3\n \n ............................................10\n \nInsights for Policy Analysis: Key Sectors and the Challenges Facing the Country in \n2050\n .....................................................................................................................12\n \n\n2. \n\nCurrent Pledges and Policy Actions\n\n ...............................................................................15\n \n\n2.1  Policies and Plans\n2.2  Current Pledges and Implications of Sector Policies\n2.3  Review and Analysis of Current Subnational Pledges and Actions\n2.4  Decoupling Economic Growth and Low-Carbon Emissions\n2.5  Government Strategies for Private Sector Inclusion\n2.6  Major Strengths and Weakness of Current Policy Actions and Strategies\n2.7  Major Challenges in Technology Resource Mobilization and Private and Public \n\n ................................................................................................15\n \n .............................................20\n \n .......................34\n \n ...................................36\n \n ..............................................37\n \n .............37\n \n\nFinance\n\n .................................................................................................................41\n \n\n3. \n\nAchieving Low-Carbon Green Asia 2050\n\n .......................................................................44\n \n\n3.1  The Role of Lifestyle Choices, National Innovation Systems and Technology \n\nTransfer, and Market-Based Instruments in Achieving Voluntary Targets, and the \nCosts Involved\n\n ......................................................................................................44\n \n\n3.2  Positioning National Actions within the Current Global Climate Regime and \n\nRegional Cooperation Framework\n\n3.3  Trade and Investment Links with Other Asian Economies\n3.4  Major Constraints on Regional Cooperation, and Solutions\n3.5  Major Policy Reforms in Thailand\n3.6  Summary of Recommendations\n\n.........................................................................51\n \n ....................................52\n \n ..................................52\n \n..........................................................................54\n \n ............................................................................58\n \n\nReferences\n\n ...............................................................................................................................63\n \n\nAnnex I:\n\n.....................................................................................................................................67\n \n\n \n1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1  Current Economic Development and Future Emission Profiles \n\nThailand is a developing country in Southeast Asia, which has shifted from having an \nagriculture-based economy to an industry-driven economy. Since 1960, there has been rapid \neconomic growth in Thailand, with significant expansion of the industry sector. The contribution \nto gross domestic product (GDP) of the industry sector increased from 22.6% during the 1960s \nto 43.9% in 2005 (Akrasanee 2006). \n\nThe national economy is predicted to continue to grow at a slower rate up to 2030. The National \nInstitute of Development Administration projected that Thailand\u2019s GDP would increase by 3%\u2013\n5% per year from 2010 to 2030 (based on electricity demand) (Table 1.1). \n\nTable 1.1: Thailand Gross Domestic Product Projection \n\nYear \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n\nLow Scenario \n3.41 \n3.88 \n3.84 \n3.50 \n4.32 \n3.97 \n3.82 \n3.85 \n3.68 \n3.75 \n3.87 \n3.82 \n3.63 \n3.60 \n3.58 \n3.58 \n3.58 \n3.58 \n3.58 \n3.58 \n3.58 \n\nBase Scenario \n3.41 \n4.02 \n4.24 \n4.06 \n4.78 \n4.46 \n4.28 \n4.28 \n4.10 \n4.15 \n4.24 \n4.18 \n4.01 \n3.95 \n3.92 \n3.92 \n3.92 \n3.92 \n3.92 \n3.92 \n3.92 \n\nHigh Scenario \n3.41 \n4.28 \n4.78 \n4.24 \n5.12 \n4.83 \n4.61 \n4.60 \n4.43 \n4.49 \n4.58 \n4.53 \n4.37 \n4.31 \n4.28 \n4.28 \n4.28 \n4.28 \n4.28 \n4.28 \n4.28 \n\nNotes: Figures in the table represent GDP growth. GDP projection for each year is projected under three scenarios (low \nscenario, base scenario, and high scenario). Each scenario reflects the possibility of economic growth, e.g., the low \nscenario refers to low economic growth and high scenario refers to high economic growth. \n\nSource: National Institute of Development Administration 2010 \n\nBased  on  the  GDP  projection  (GDP  data  from  2031  to  2050  are  assumed  to  be  the  same  as \nGDP in 2030, and sector GDP data are assumed based on expert opinions) and other key data \nfor  each  sector,  greenhouse  gas  emission  projection  until  2050  was  carried  out  by  the  Joint \nGraduate  School  for  Energy  and  Management  (JGSEE)  for  the  Thailand  Greenhouse  Gas \nManagement  Organization  (TGO).  The  study  projected  greenhouse  gas  emissions  for  three \nscenarios: business as usual, power development plan 2010, and climate plan scenario. \n\n1.1.1  Business-as-Usual Scenario  \nUnder the business as usual (BAU) scenario, greenhouse gas emission from all economic \nactivities were estimated without any implementation of greenhouse gas emission reduction \nactivities.

The electricity generation source \nratio is assumed to remain the same until 2050, with natural gas at 71% and coal at 20%.

To extend this scenario to 2050, the ratio of energy sources for \nelectricity generation from 2031 to 2050 is assumed to be the same as the ratio in 2030. \n\nUnder  the  PDP  2010,  the  power  sector  will  undergo  changes  in  terms  of  primary  energy \nsources\u2014decreased use of natural gas and lignite and increased use of coal (Table 1.3).  \n\nTable 1.3: Key Assumptions and Factors in the Power Development Plan 2010 \nScenario \n\nSector \nPower sector: PDP 2010  \n\nIn 2020, natural gas at 55% and coal at 12% (including lignite at \n\nAssumptions and Factors  \n\n7.3%) \n\n3%) \n\nIn 2030, natural gas at 40% and coal at 21% (including lignite at \n\nFrom 2031 to 2050, the ratio remains the same as at 2030 \n\nPDP = power development plan. \n\nSource: Joint Graduate School for Energy and Management 2010 \n\nIn  the  PDP  2010  scenario,  it  is  estimated  that  the  amount  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from \nelectricity generation per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity will reduce from 0.482 kilograms (kg) \nof carbon dioxide (CO2) per kWh in 2010 to 0.368 kg CO2/kWh in 2030 (Table 1.4).  \n\nTable 1.4: Estimated Carbon Dioxide Emissions under the Power Development \nPlan 2010, 2010\u20132030 \n\nEstimated CO2\n\n Emissions \n\n(kg CO\n\n2/kWh) \n\nYear \n\n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n\n0.482 \n0.471 \n0.470 \n0.462 \n0.468 \n0.448 \n0.423 \n0.408 \n0.398 \n0.401 \n0.387 \n0.374 \n0.373 \n0.381 \n0.361 \n0.341 \n0.357 \n0.354 \n0.363 \n0.367 \n0.368 \n\n5 \n \n\nkg CO 2\n\n/kWh = kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour \n\nSource: Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand 2010 \n\n                                                \n1 The PDP 2010 is a long-term national electricity generation and development plan, which will be effective from 2010 \n\nto 2030. \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nWith  such  expected  changes  in  the  power  sector,  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  power \nsector are projected to increase due to the increasing electricity demand.

Therefore,  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  are \nimportant  considerations  when  addressing  energy  security  and  economic  growth,  as  well  as \nclimate change in Thailand (Nakawiroa, Bhattacharyyaa, and Limmeechokchaib 2008).  \n\nThe  current  direction  for  key  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  policies  in  Thailand  have \nbeen laid down until 2030. With the 15-Year Renewable Energy Development Plan, the 20-Year \nEnergy  Conservation  Plan,  and  the  Power  Development  Plan  2010  (PDP  2010),  the  country\u2019s \ndirection can be summarized as follows: renewable energy and energy efficiency will be further \npromoted  with  both  traditional  and  innovative  measures  to  increase  energy  security  and \nsafeguard  the  environment.  Public\u2013private  partnership  will  be  emphasized  and  the  role  of  the \nprivate  sector  in  promoting  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  will  be  more  prominent. \nAdditionally, massive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are expected.  \n\nEven  though  the  development  of  renewable  energy  and  progress  on  energy  efficiency  is \nexpected, it is unavoidable that fossil fuels will remain the primary source of energy supply and \nThailand  will  still  rely  on  imported  energy.  Based  on  the  current  policies  and  plans,  the \nchallenges  for  Thailand  to  foster  green  and  low-carbon  development  are  renewable  energy \nutilization and the PDP 2010.   \n\n1.3.1.1  Renewable Energy Utilization \n\nAlthough  the  15-Year  Renewable  Energy  Development  Plan  (described  in  section  2)  is \nformulated  based  upon  the  domestic  potentials  in  the  country,  there  are  challenges  for  the \ncountry to meet the renewable energy utilization targets. Based on the implementation result in \n2010,  the  gaps  between  the  utilization  target  and  actual  utilization  can  be  clearly  observed, \nespecially for wind, hydropower, biomass, and municipal waste (Table 1.8). \n\nTable 1.8: Renewable Energy Utilization, 2010 \n\nRenewable Energy Source \nWind (MW) \nSolar \n\nHydropower (MW) \nBiomass \n\nBiogas \n\nMunicipal waste \n\nElectricity (MW) \nHeat (ktoe) \n\nElectricity (MW) \nHeat (ktoe) \nElectricity (MW) \nHeat (ktoe) \nElectricity (MW) \nHeat (ktoe) \n\nEthanol (million liters/day)  \nBiodiesel (million liters/day) \n\nUtilization  \n\n5.61 \n48.57 \n2.14 \n58.85 \n1,650.00 \n3,136.00 \n103.40 \n311.00 \n13.13 \n1.09 \n1.23 \n1.72 \n\nTarget  \n45.00 \n48.00 \n2.80 \n142.00 \n2,454.00 \n3,130.00 \n55.00 \n320.00 \n58.00 \n7.00 \n2.11 \n1.35 \n\nktoe = thousand tons of oil equivalent, MW = megawatt. \n\nSource: Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency 2011a. \n\nDifference \n(39.39) \n0.57 \n(0.66) \n(83.15) \n(804.00) \n(6.00) \n48.40 \n(9.00) \n(44.87) \n(5.91) \n(0.88) \n0.37 \n\nThere  are  several  challenges  for  increasing  renewable  energy  utilization,  one  of  the  key  ones \nbeing  the  lack  of  financial  incentive.

The  PDP  2010  is  trying  to  address  these  issues  by  diversifying  energy \nsources through the introduction of nuclear power and coal. However, the suitability and public \nacceptance of nuclear power and coal are issues that need to be addressed. \n\nNuclear Power  \n\nBefore  the  nuclear  accident  in  Fukushima  (Japan)  in  2010,  most  Thai  people  agreed  with \nnuclear  power,  although  they  did  not  want  the  nuclear  power  plants  to  be  located  in  their \ncommunities and provinces. Since the Fukushima accident, the public and media are very much \naware of the dangers of nuclear power, and the problems that may occur in Thailand if nuclear \npower  plants  are  constructed.  Furthermore,  there  are  concerns  and  questions  regarding  the \nreadiness  of,  and  the  need  for,  Thailand  to  have  nuclear  power  plants.  There  are  also  strong \nantinuclear  movements,  especially  in  the  potential  locations  for  the  nuclear  power  plants.  The \npublic is urging the government not to ever build nuclear power plants in Thailand. Currently, the \ngovernment has ceased the process of considering nuclear power plants, but nuclear power is \nstill in the PDP 2010. \n\nCoal-Fired Power  \n\nCoal-fired  power  plants  are  also  not  welcomed  by  most  Thai  people,  and  serious  questions \nsurround the health and environmental impacts of coal, especially air pollution. There are anti-\ncoal movements in several areas, especially potential construction areas. The government has \nprovided  information  about  coal  being  environmentally  friendly  when  used  in  clean  coal \ntechnologies; however, the public still does not agree with coal-fired power plants. \n\nWith a solution being required for achieving energy security, the government together with the \npublic  and  other  stakeholders  should  agree  on  a  future  national  power  plan,  including  nuclear \npower and coal power. \n\n1.3.2  Industry Sector \n\nThe industry sector has been involved in greenhouse gas emissions reduction through energy \nefficiency and conservation activities. There are a range of measures and programs provided by \nthe  government  to  support  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  in  industry,  and  progress  has \nbeen  made.  However,  implementation  is  limited  to  large  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  As \nthere are millions of  small enterprises in Thailand, the challenge remains for related agencies to \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \npromote  and  provide  support  for  small  enterprises  to  improve  their  performance  on  energy \nefficiency and conservation. \n\nEnergy  efficiency  technologies  are  the  other  main  obstacle  to  achieving  a  low-carbon  industry \nsector. Such technologies are still expensive and technology deployment remains difficult for a \nnumber of industries. It is essential for the relevant agencies to consider how to bring down the \ncost of energy efficiency technologies so that deployment can occur on a wide scale. \n\nThe other strategy for promoting greenhouse gas emissions reduction in the industry sector is to \npromote  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  by  using  on-site  renewable  energy  generation \ntechnologies.  There  are  several  viable  renewable  technology  options  that  can  be  installed  at \nfactory  sites  to  generate  energy.  However,  promotion  of  and  support  for  on-site  renewable \nenergy  generation  technologies  in  industry  are  not  yet  realized  in  the  policy.  Thus,  it  is \nnecessary  for  policy  makers  to  consider  the  possibilities  that  on-site  renewable  energy \ngeneration technologies offer the industry sector. \n\n1.3.3  Agriculture Sector \n\nGreenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  policies  in  agriculture  involve  farmers\u2019  practices,  such  as \ncontrolling  water  in  rice  fields  and  changing  crop  cultivation  practices.  Changing  traditional \npractices can be a challenge because farmers are used to traditional practices.  \n\n1.3.4  Waste Sector \nPolicies  on  waste  in  Thailand  are  in  line  with  the  \u201d3Rs\u201d  concept. 2\n  There  are  a  number  of \nprograms and activities to promote the implementation of 3Rs, especially in Bangkok and other \nbig  cities;  however,  waste  management  remains a  problem. The key  challenges for  the  waste \nsector  pertaining  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  are  to  reduce  or  maintain  the  waste \ngeneration rate and increase the recycling rate.  \n\nWaste  generation  involves  both  product  provision  systems  (ways  that  products  are  produced \nand  provided  for  consumers)  and  consumption  behaviors.  In  Thailand,  the  consumption  level, \nespecially  in  cities,  is  growing  due  to  many  factors,  including  changing  lifestyles;  people \ngenerally  consume  more  than  they  used  to.  Additionally,  there  are  increasing  numbers  of \ndisposable products and packaging. As a result, reducing or maintaining the waste generation \nrate is a challenging task.  \n\nWaste recycling rate in Thailand is still low (23% of household waste was recycled in 2008 [PCD \n2009]).  Possible  explanations  for  low  recycling  rates  are  that  people  do  not  separate  wastes, \ninfrastructure  for  waste  separation  is  not  in  place,  the  waste  collection  system  does  not \ncorresponded to recycling practices, and there are limited recycling technologies. These are the \nkey challenges for increasing the waste recycling rate. \n\n                                                \n2 \n\n3Rs concept refers to reuse, reduce, and recycle. \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n\n2.  CURRENT PLEDGES AND POLICY ACTIONS \n\n2.1  Policies and Plans \n\nIn Thailand,  primary  actions  and  pledges  concerning greenhouse gas  emissions  reduction  are \nassociated with renewable energy and energy efficiency. The plan to promote renewable energy \nand  energy  efficiency  became  tangible  with  the  establishment  of  the  Energy  Conservation \n(ENCON) Program in 1995. Progress toward renewable energy and energy efficiency is driven \nby \nthe  15-Year  Renewable  Energy  Development  Plan  (REDP)  and  20-Year  Energy \nConservation Plan.  \n\n2.1.1  Energy Conservation Program  \n\nThe  ENCON  Program  is  the  master  plan  that  lays  down  the  framework  for  developing \nrenewable  energy  and  improving  energy  efficiency  in Thailand.

Based  on  domestic  resources  and  potentials,  the  Government  of  Thailand \nformulated  the  15-Year  Renewable  Energy  Development  Plan  (REDP)  to  (i)  strengthen  the \nsecurity of energy provision; (ii) promote the use of energy for an integrated green community; \n(iii) support the alternative energy technology industry; and (iv) research, develop, and promote \nhigh-efficiency  alternative  energy  technologies  (Ministry  of  Energy  2009).

It  is  expected  that,  when  the \nREDP  is  successfully  implemented,  there  will  be  greenhouse  gas  reductions  of  around \n42MtCO2eq in 2022 (Ministry of Energy 2009) (Table 2.3). \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n\nTable 2.3: The 15-Year Renewable Energy Development Plan  \n\nEnergy \n\nPotential \n\nExisting \n\n2006\u20132011 \n\n2012\u20132016 \n\n2017\u20132022 \n\nMW \n\nMW \n\nktoe \n\nMW \n\nktoe \n\nMW \n\nktoe \n\nElectricity \nSolar \nWind \n\nHydropower \n\nBiomass \nBiogas \nMunicipal \nwaste \nHydrogen \nTotal \n\nHeat \n\nSolar \nBiomass \nBiogas \nMunicipal \nwaste \nTotal \n\nBiofuel \n\nMW \n50,000 \n1,600 \n\n700 \n\n4,400 \n190 \n\n400 \n\n \nktoe \n\n154 \n7,400 \n600 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMillion \nliters/day \n3.00 \n4.20 \n \n\n \n\nEthanol \nBiodiesel \nHydrogen \nTotal \nFinal Energy \nConsumption (ktoe) \nFinal Renewable Energy \nConsumption (ktoe) \nPercent of Renewable \nEnergy (%) \nNGV (mmscfd) \n(ktoe) \nPercent of Alternative \nEnergy (%) \n\n32 \n1 \n\n56 \n\n1,610 \n46 \n\n5 \n\n \n1,750 \n\n1 \n2,781 \n224 \n\n1 \n\nktoe \n\n3,007 \n\nMillion \nliters/day \n1.24 \n1.56 \n \n \n\n66,248 \n\n4,237 \n\n6.4 \n\n108.1 \n \n\n \n\n55 \n115 \n\n165 \n\n6 \n13 \n\n43 \n\n2,800 \n60 \n\n1,463 \n27 \n\n78 \n\n35 \n\n0 \n3,273 \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nMillion \nliters/day \n3.00 \n3.00 \n0 \n6.00 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n393 \n \n\n0 \n1,587 \nktoe \n\n5 \n3,660 \n470 \n\n15 \n\n4,150 \n\nktoe \n\n805 \n950 \n0 \n1,755 \n\n70,300 \n\n7,492 \n\n10.6 \n\n3,469 \n10,961 \n\n15.6 \n\n95 \n375 \n\n281 \n\n3,220 \n90 \n\n130 \n\n0 \n4,191 \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nMillion \nliters/day \n6.20 \n3.64 \n0 \n9.84 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n596 \n \n\n11 \n42 \n\n73 \n\n1,682 \n40 \n\n58 \n\n0 \n1,907 \nktoe \n\n18 \n5,000 \n540 \n\n24 \n\n5,582 \n\nktoe \n\n1,686 \n1,145 \n0 \n2,831 \n\n81,500 \n\n10,319 \n\n12.7 \n\n5,260 \n15,579 \n\n19.1 \n\n500 \n800 \n\n324 \n\n56 \n89 \n\n85 \n\n3,700 \n120 \n\n1,933 \n54 \n\n160 \n\n72 \n\n3.5 \n5,608 \n \n\n1 \n2,290 \nktoe \n\n38 \n6,760 \n600 \n\n35 \n\n7,433 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nktoe \n\nMillion \nliters/day \n9.00 \n4.50 \n\n2,447 \n1,415 \n0.1 m kg   124.00 \n3,986 \n\n13.50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n690 \n \n\n97,300 \n\n13,709 \n\n14.1 \n\n6,090 \n19,799 \n\n20.3 \n\nktoe = thousand tons of oil equivalent, Mmscfd = million standard cubic feet per day, MW = megawatt.

In \ngeneral, most pledges and actions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that have been given \nand taken are considered to be \u201cno-regret\u201d3 policies and actions. Most of these implementation \napproaches  are related to  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy (based  on  local  resources  and \npotentials),  forest  conservation,  and  afforestation  and  reforestation.  Additionally,  least-cost \npolicy options are being implemented in the energy sector. However, most sectors do not have \nclear greenhouse gas reduction targets  (in terms  of  MtCO\neq); most targets  are  set  based  on \nthe  policies,  plans,  and  actions  themselves,  which  are  usually  implemented  in  more  than  one \nsector. The details of pledges and actions for each sector are described in sections 2.2.1\u20132.2.7. \n\n2\n\n                                                \n3 No-regret policies and actions can be referred to as policies and actions that create economic benefits (or at least \n\nno economic losses) and result in reduction of greenhouse gases. \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.2.1  Energy and Power Sector \n\n2.2.1.1  Alternative and Renewable Energy \n\nSince  the  beginning  of  the  ENCON  Program  in  Thailand,  the  government  has  adopted \nnumerous policies and measures to ensure renewable energy is developed and utilized.

One of the key implications is the substantial growth of the \nsector, especially small and very small  power producers (SPPs and VSPPs). Policy measures \nallowed small producers to join the energy production sector (financially) and attracted investors \nto renewable energy projects. The growth of the energy production sector is a reflection of the \nincreasing number of renewable energy projects in Thailand, especially in biomass, biogas and \nbiofuel.  \n\nAnother key implication is on national energy security. Introducing renewable energy promotion \npolicies and measures has increased the energy security of the nation. Developing and utilizing \nrenewable  energy  increases  energy  availability,  enhances  energy  diversity,  augments  the \navailability  of  clean  energy  technologies,  improves  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  power \nproduction, reduces dependency on imported energy, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom power production. \n\nHowever,  there  are  some  concerns  regarding  development  and  utilization  of  renewable \nenergy\u2014such as competition for resource utilization, forest intrusion, and the \u201cfood versus fuel\u201d \nissue.  Moreover,  some  current  incentives  may  not  be  sufficient  to  attract  investment  in  some \nrenewable energy sources, such as wind power. \n\n2.2.2  Industry Sector \n\n2.2.2.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Energy Conservation and Efficiency \n\nThailand began to take serious action on energy conservation and efficiency in the early 1990s. \nOne  of  the  notable  programs  to  promote  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  in  the  industry \nsector  is  the  national  Energy  Conservation  (ENCON)  Program  It  comprises  a  number  of \ncompulsory,  voluntary,  and  complementary  measures  and  activities  (Table  2.9).

Energy  efficiency  can  be  targeted  at  both  technology  and  human \nimprovements.  One  of  the  comprehensive  approaches  to  promoting  energy  efficiency  is  total \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nenergy  management  (TEM),4\nemployee training for energy efficiency and conservation. \n\n  which  takes  into  account  both  technological  improvements  and \n\nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Through Labeling Schemes \n\nThe Carbon  Reduction  Label is a label that shows reduced greenhouse gas emissions of the \nproduct  or  service  (for  the  same  manufacturer  compared  with  base  year  [2002])  in  terms  of \n)  equivalent.  It  has  been  established  through  cooperation  between  the \ncarbon  dioxide  (CO2\nThailand  Greenhouse  Gas  Management  Organization  (TGO)  and  the  Thailand  Environment \nInstitute  (TEI).  The  aims  are  to  encourage  manufacturers  and  consumers  to  be  a  part  of \ngreenhouse  gas  emission  reduction.  During  the  initial  stage  (up  until  November  2011),  the \nscope  of  evaluation  for  greenhouse  gas  reduction  has  been  limited  solely  to  the  production \nstage.  The  implementation  and  implementation  results  of  the  Carbon  Reduction  Label  are  in \nBox.1. \n\nIn  addition  to  the  Carbon  Reduction  Label,  there  are  other  labeling  schemes  related  to \ngreenhouse gas emission reductions, including Carbon Footprint, CoolMode, Green Label, and \nEnergy Efficiency Label (non-electrical). Carbon  Footprint is a label showing greenhouse gas \nemissions  from  each  production  unit  for  the  product  life  cycle  (cradle  to  grave),  i.e.,  the \ncalculation  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  emitted  from  raw  material  extraction,  transportation, \nproduction,  utilization,  and  waste  management  of  product.  The  aims  of  the  Carbon  Footprint \nlabel  are  to  increase  the  attention  of  the  industry  sector  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  to \nincrease  the  competitiveness  of  Thai  industries  in  the  world  market.  As  of  September  2011, \nthere were 233 products from 68 companies certified with Carbon Footprint (TGO 2011c). \n\nCoolMode is a label initiative for clothing showing the  reduction of greenhouse gas emissions \nas a result of reduced electricity consumption. The label will be issued to textile manufacturers \nwho make materials that are comfortable to wear and breathable, allowing for decreased energy \nconsumption due to reduced need for air conditioning. Furthermore, the fabric should be easy to \nclean  to reduce  water  consumption. The  aims  are  to  encourage  the textile  industry  to  develop \nCoolMode  fabrics  for  selling  in  the  domestic  and  export  market  and  to  give  consumers  more \noptions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As of September 2011, 18 types of fabric from six \ncompanies were certified with CoolMode (TGO 2011a). \n\nGreen  Label  is  a  Type  I  eco-label,  which  awards  specific  products  that  have  reduced \nenvironmental impacts from a life-cycle perspective than other products with the same function. \nAn initiative of the Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development (TBCSD), the Green \nLabel was launched in 1994 by the Thailand Environment Institute (TEI) in association with the \nMinistry of Industry. From the initial period to June 2011, there were certification criteria for 48 \nproducts, and 506 products from 25 product categories and 75 producers were registered (TEI \n2011). \n\nThe  Energy  Efficiency  Label  was  initiated  by  the  Department  of Alternative  Energy \nDevelopment  and  Efficiency  (DEDE)  to  address  high  energy  consumption  (non-electrical) \nmachines,  equipment,  and  materials.  The  label  covers  household  gas  stoves,  variable  speed \ndrives,  insulators,  and  energy-saving  glass.  As  of  2009,  the  Energy  Efficiency  Label  program \nhad  issued  577,850  labels for gas  stoves,  which generated fuel savings  equal to  21 thousand \ntons  of  oil  equivalent  (ktoe)  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  of  0.118  MtCO 2\neq/year \n(Sajjakulnukit 2011). \n\n                                                \n4 Details of the TEM approach can be found in the TEM handbook: available at http://www.asiaeec-\n\ncol.eccj.or.jp/cooperation/1-1-1/01.pdf \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.2.2.3 \n\nImplications of Industry Sector Policies  \n\nImplemented  alternative  and  renewable  energy  and  energy  conservation  and  efficiency \nmeasures have a number of positive implications for sector policy and the economy. The first is \nawareness  of  energy  and  environmental  issues  in  the  industry  sector.  Because  burgeoning \nindustrial  development  in  Thailand  brought  environmental  and  high-energy  consumption \nproblems  along  with  economic  growth,  the  Government  of  Thailand  introduced  environmental \nregulations  as  well  as  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  measures  (both  compulsory  and \nvoluntary).  This  led  the  industry  sector  to  incorporate  environmental  rationalities  as  well  as \nenergy conservation and efficiency principles into corporate principles and practices. However, \nthe implementation of these principles varies by industry and company. \n\nThe second implication is the utilization of wastes and unused materials for energy production. \nRenewable energy incentive schemes made it possible to utilize wastes and unused materials \nto  generate  power  and  electricity.  This  brings  financial  and  environmental  benefits  to  both  the \ncompany and the environment. \n\nThe  third  implication  is  the  competitiveness  of  the  industry  sector  and  growth  of  the  national \neconomy.  The  implementation  of  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  measures  is  related  to \ntechnical  and  behavioral  changes,  which  manifested  as  lower  energy  consumption  (lower \nenergy costs). As a result, the competitiveness of Thai industries has increased, allowing them \nto compete globally. This is especially true for export-oriented industries such as the electrical \nand  electronics  industry  and  the  food  processing  industry.  Increased  competitiveness  also \ncontributes to national economic growth in terms of revenue from exports. \n\nThe fourth implication is the environmental and climate change awareness of consumers. Since \nthe  emergence  of  the  Green  Label  (in  1992)  and  now  with  the  current  initiatives  on  carbon \nlabeling (Carbon Reduction Label, Carbon Footprint, and CoolMode), awareness of consumers \non environmental issues, especially climate change, has significantly increased. This is reflected \nin the survey, Thai People with Global Warming, conducted in Bangkok and other large cities in \nThailand  including  in  Chiang  Mai  province,  Khonkaen  province,  and  Songkhla  province  by \nAssumption University. The survey shows that more than 97% of the population were aware of \nglobal  warming,  more  than  82%  perceived  that  global  warming  posed  a  threat  to  the  national \neconomy, and more than 67% were concerned that global warming would pose a threat to their \nworking  conditions  (Assumption  University,  cited  in  Chotichanathawewong  and  Thongplew \n2009).  One  reason  that  climate  change  and  global  warming  have  become  well  known  is \nbecause of the labeling schemes. \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n\nBox 1: Case Study: Carbon Reduction Label \n\n\uf06c  Aims to encourage manufacturers and consumers to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions \n\n\uf06c  151 products from 37 manufacturers obtained Carbon Reduction Label (as of September \n\n\uf06c  Certified  products \n\ninclude \n\nfood  and  beverages,  personal  products,  packaging, \n\nImplementation: \n\nthrough everyday purchasing \n\n2011) (Vongvanich 2011) \n\nequipment, and construction materials \n\nKey results and implications: \n\n\uf06c  Greenhouse gas emission reduction from this program is estimated at 4.47 MtCO\neq (as \n2\n\nof September 2011) (Vongvanich 2011) \n\n\uf06c  Climate  change  awareness  is  increasing  among  manufactures  and  consumers,  and \n\ngreenhouse gas mitigation actions have been taken \n\n \n\n2.2.3  Commercial and Residential Sector \n\n2.2.3.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Energy Conservation and Efficiency \n\nThe Government of Thailand has implemented a number of measures on energy conservation \nand  efficiency  in  the  commercial  and  residential  sector  (under  the  ENCON  Program).  Several \npolicy  measures  for  promoting  energy  efficiency  (Table  2.10)  are  being  implemented  under \ndemand-side  management  and  other  policies\u2014energy  standards  and  regulations,  capacity \nbuilding, energy efficiency networking, awareness raising, and financial incentives.  \n\nIn the commercial sector, implemented activities promote the use of energy efficient equipment \nand energy conservation. Most fiscal and financial measures for promoting energy efficiency in \nthe  commercial  sector  are  the  same  as  those  in  the  industry  sector\u2014Revolving  Fund,  ESCO \nFund, tax incentives, and subsidy. \n\nIn  the  residential  sector,  implemented  measures  are  mostly  campaigns  promoting  energy \nefficient appliances and creating awareness on energy saving. It is estimated that the demand-\nside  management  program  can  reduce  the  demand  for  electricity  by  120  MW/year  (du  Pont \n2005).  One  of  the  ongoing  energy  efficiency  activities  implemented  under  the  demand-side \nmanagement  program  is  the  Energy  Efficiency  Label  (Energy  Label  No.  5).  The  program  is \ntargeted  at  reducing  the  use  of  high  energy  consumption  appliances  and  products  through \nenergy  efficiency  certification. The  Energy  Label  No.  5  program  is  regarded  as  successful (du \nPont 1998; Singh and Mulholland 2000). \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n\nTable 2.10: Energy Efficiency Instruments Implemented in the Commercial and \nResidential Sector \n\nPolicy Measure  \nEquipment/appliance \nlabeling \nBuilding codes \n\nEnergy Audits \n\nFiscal and financial \nincentives \n\nEnergy efficiency \nnetworking \nAwards \n\nCampaign programs \n\nCommercial/ \nResidential \n\nImplementation \n\nCommercial \nResidential \nCommercial \nResidential \nCommercial \nResidential \nCommercial \n\nResidential \nCommercial \nResidential \nCommercial \nResidential \nCommercial \nResidential \n\nYes \nYes \nYes \nNo \nVoluntary \n \nRevolving Fund \n(ENCON Fund), \nESCO Fund, Tax \nincentives, and \nSubsidy* \nNo \nYes \nNo \nYes \nYes** \nYes \nYes \n\n* Described in Chapter 3. \n\n**Energy conservation award for homes \n\nSource: Author\u2019s summary \n\n2.2.3.2 \n\nImplications of Commercial and Residential Sector Policies  \n\nThe  implication  of  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  measures  for  the  commercial  and \nresidential sector is increasing concern in Thai society on energy efficiency. Further, appliance \nproducers can continue to manufacture more efficient products.5\n  \n\n2.2.4  Building Sector \n\n2.2.4.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Energy Conservation and Efficiency \n\nMost  of  the  energy  conservation  and  energy  efficiency  measures  for  the  building  sector  are \nimplemented  in  combination  with  the  commercial  and  residential  sector  (under  the  ENCON \nProgram).  The  measures  for  buildings  are  building  codes  and  regulations,  capacity  building, \nenergy efficiency networking, awareness raising, and financial incentives.  \n\nOne  discrete  policy  measure  exists  for  the  building  sector,  whereby  energy  management  is \nimplemented for designated buildings and factories and building energy codes are implemented \nfor new buildings. \n\n2.2.4.2  Carbon Reduction Certification for Building \n\nCarbon Reduction Certification for Building is a voluntary initiative of the Thailand Environment \nInstitute  (TEI)  and  the  Thailand  Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development  (TBCSD) \nintroduced  in  2010.  Its  aim  is  to  encourage  nonresidential  building  owners  to  reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions through reduced of electricity consumption, fossil fuel consumption, \n\n                                                \n5 Energy Label No. 5 is discussed further in section 3. \n\n26 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nand waste generation. This certification scheme allows building owners to declare their intention \nto  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  communicate  this  to  the  public.  This  scheme  also \ncreates  a  commitment  by  and  incentives  for  building  owners  to  continue  to  improve  their \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  strategies  and  actions  for  the  building.  As  of  September \n2011,  eight  buildings  from  five  companies  had  been  awarded  with  the  Carbon  Reduction \nCertification for Building, resulting in greenhouse gas emission reductions of around 16,000 tons \nCO2\n\neq/year (compared with base year in 2002) (Thailand Environment Institute 2011b). \n\n2.2.4.3 \n\nImplications of Building Sector Policies  \n\nIt is clear that policy measures and voluntary activities in energy conservation and efficiency in \nthe  building  sector  have  resulted  in  increasing  awareness  on  energy  efficiency  and  climate \nchange. As a result of enforced standards, codes, awards, and labeling schemes, the building \nsector,  and  especially  designated  buildings,  have  adopted  the  concept  of  energy  conservation \nand  efficiency  and  implemented  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  measures  in  order  to \ncomply with regulations. Some proactive organizations take further actions in order to be seen \nas  leaders  in  energy  efficiency  by  applying  for  the  international  green  building  certification  \u2013 \nLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). \n\n2.2.5  Transport Sector \n\n2.2.5.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Alternative and Renewable Energy  \n\nIn the transport sector, use of biofuels (gasohol and biodiesel) is promoted on both the demand \nand supply sides. Demand-side measures are the mandatory and voluntary uses of gasohol and \nbiodiesel  for  vehicles.  One  mandatory  measure  applies  to  diesel  fuel,  whereby  diesel  for \nvehicles  is  diesel  B3  (3%  biodiesel).  Additionally,  price  incentives  for  consumers  are \nimplemented in some high-percentage biofuels (E10, E20, E85, and B5).  \n\nOn  the  supply  side,  measures  are  implemented  under  the  REDP,  which  are  described  in  the \nsections  of  background  information  (Section  2.1.2)  and  pledges  and  policy  actions  of  energy \nand  power  sector  (Section  2.2.1)  (fiscal  and  other  incentive  measures  are  implemented  for \nethanol and biodiesel producers). \n\nThe government also gives strong support to the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) in the \ntransport  sector,  including  public  transport  (buses  and  taxis)  by  subsidizing  the  retail  price. \nWithin the last few years, the demand for CNG for vehicles has substantially increased due to \nthe high price of gasoline and the subsidized price of CNG. The number of fuelling stations has \nincreased to serve the demand for CNG. \n\n2.2.5.2  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Energy Efficiency and Public Transport \n\nOther energy efficiency transport sector policies are \u201ceco cars\u201d, public transport, and park-and-\nride  scheme  policies. The  eco  car  policy  provides  incentives for  car manufacturers to  produce \ncars  that  have  small  engines,  are  energy  efficient,  and  have  low  fuel  consumption  and  high \nemission standards. The extension of mass public transport, especially in Bangkok, is another \ngovernment policy\u2014BTS skytrain, MRT system, and Bus Rapid Transit are new public transport \nsystems in the Bangkok metropolitan area. The BTS Skytrain is a mass public transport system \nwith  extended  coverage  in  Bangkok  and  vicinity.  The  MRT  system  (also  known  as  Bangkok \nMetro)  is  an  underground  mass  rapid  transit  system,  which  also  has  an  extension  plan.  Bus \nRapid  Transit  carries  commuters  between  suburbs  and  the  city.  The  park-and-ride  scheme \nprovides  parking  areas  for  commuters  in  outer  areas  so  they  can  then  travel  to  the  city  using \nskytrains and underground trains. \n\n27 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.2.5.3 \n\nImplications of Transport Sector Policies  \n\nIntroducing  biofuels,  natural  gas,  and  eco  car  policies  has  a  number  of  implications  for  the \ntransport  sector.  Car  manufacturers  have  adapted  to  changes  in  government  policy  by \nintroducing  new  cars  to  the  market,  such  as  eco  cars  (high  fuel  efficiency  and  low  emissions) \nand cars that use biofuels. \n\nAnother  implication  is  the  change  in  fuel  use  for  vehicles.  Because  of  the  higher  cost  of \ngasoline, many car users, including personal car users, have modified their cars for CNG use. \nThe  switch  from  gasoline  to  CNG  has  occurred  mostly  in  areas  where  there  are  natural  gas \nfuelling stations available, especially in big cities such as Bangkok. \n\nThe  other  implication  is  the  use  of  public  transportation  among  people  in  Bangkok  and \nsurrounded areas. BTS skytrain and MRT system have become the main choice of commuters \ntraveling from suburbs to the city and commuting within the city. \n\n2.2.6  Agriculture Sector \n\nRecently,  the  Government  of  Thailand  implemented  an  agricultural  plan  on  climate  change \n(including  both  greenhouse  gas  mitigation  and  adaptation),  which  focuses  on  research  and \ndevelopment  for  new  plants  (high  yield  and  resistance,  and  low  maintenance  and  inputs), \nplantations,  production  of  agricultural  products,  agricultural \nlogistics. \nHowever, implementation is still in the early stages. \n\ntechnologies,  and \n\n2.2.7  Other Pledges and Actions \n\n2.2.7.1  Greenhouse Gas Reduction Through Forest Conservation and Afforestation and \n\nReforestation \n\nThe aim of the key national forest policy is to have at least 40% of the country\u2019s area as forest, \nwhich  is  to  be  utilized  for  two  primary  purposes.  The  first  purpose  is  for  conservation \n(conserving soil, water, plants, and wild animals), including for study, research, and recreation \n(25% of the national area) (Royal Forest Department 2011b). The second purpose is for forest \nto be used economic purposes (15% of the national area). \n\nThe forest area in Thailand decreased to 25% in the late 1990s. Since then, forest areas have \ncontinuously  increased  as  a  result  of  forest  conservation,  afforestation,  and  reforestation \nactivities.  In  2008,  national  forest  coverage  is  about  33.5%.  Thus,  the  activities  on  forest \nconservation,  afforestation,  and  reforestation  will  be  continued  in  order  to  increase  the  forest \nareas. \n\n28 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n\nTable 2.11: Forest Areas in Thailand \n\nYear \n1973 \n1976 \n1978 \n1982 \n1985 \n1988 \n1989 \n1991 \n1993 \n1995 \n1998 \n2000 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2008 \n\nForest Area  \n(km2) \n221,707.00 \n198,417.00 \n175,224.00 \n156,600.00 \n150,866.00 \n143,803.00 \n143,417.00 \n136,698.00 \n133,554.00 \n131,485.00 \n129,722.00 \n170,110.78 \n167,590.98 \n161,001.30 \n158,652.59 \n171,585.65 \n\nPercentage of \nforest to total area \n43.21 \n38.67 \n34.15 \n30.52 \n29.40 \n28.03 \n27.95 \n26.64 \n26.03 \n25.62 \n25.28 \n33.15 \n32.66 \n31.38 \n30.92 \n33.44 \n\nkm2\n\n = square kilometer. \n\nSource: Royal Forest Department 2011 \n\n2.2.7.2  Greenhouse Gas Reduction through the Clean Development Mechanism \n\nThailand as a developing country is listed as a non-Annex I Party, and thus does not have an \nobligation  to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  However, Thailand \nparticipated in greenhouse gas emissions reduction under the Kyoto Protocol through the Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM).  In  Thailand,  the  CDM  has  played  a  significant  role  in \ngreenhouse  gas  mitigation  because  it  has  helped  make  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction \nmore feasible. \n\nAs of 1 October 2010, the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization had issued 146 \nletters  of  approval  for  CDM  projects.  From  these  projects,  it  is  estimated  that  the  total \ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction will be 8.79 million tons of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2eq) per \nyear, of which CDM biogas project activities account for 62% and biomass project activities 19% \n(Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization 2011b) (Figure 2.1). \n\n29 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nFigure 2.1: Clean Development Mechanism Projects in Thailand Receiving Letters \nof Approval \n\nCERs = certified emission reductions, MtCO 2e = million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, tCO 2\n\n = tons of carbon dioxide. \n\n \n\nSource: Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization 2011b. \n\nOf  the  CDM  projects  receiving  letters  of  approval,  55  are  registered  by  the  CDM  executive \nboard.

As  individual \ncompanies,  members  have  strived \nimprovements  and  sustainable \ndevelopment.  Several  actions  have  been  taken  to  improve  environmental  performance, \nincluding  the  mitigation  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Based  on  the  last  computation  for \ngreenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  mitigated  through  actions  on  carbon  sinks  and  sourced \nfrom  TBCSD  members,  greenhouse  gas  reductions  were  10.47  MtCO2\neq  for  2008\u20132010 \n(Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development 2011). \n\nfor  environmental \n\n2.2.7.4  Private Fragmented Efforts for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions \n\nGreenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  is  a  recent  initiative  in  the  private  sector.

Based  on  the  Action  Plan  on  Global  Warming  Mitigation  2007\u20132012,  the  BMA  will \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions by (i) expanding the mass transit rail system, (ii) promoting \nthe  use  of  renewable  energy,  (iii)  improving  building  electricity  consumption  efficiency,  (iv) \nimproving  solid-waste  management  and  wastewater  treatment  efficiency,  and  (v)  expanding \npark areas (BMA 2007). \n\nIt is expected that, by the end of 2012, greenhouse gas emission will be mitigated by 15% (9.75 \nMtCO2\neq)  compared  with  the  business-as-usual  scenario  in  2012  (BMA  2007).  Details  of \ngreenhouse gas emission mitigation for Bangkok is summarized in Table 2.13. \n\nTable 2.13: Bangkok\u2019s Action Plan on Global Warming Mitigation, 2007\u20132012 \n\nSector \nTransportation  \nBiofuels energy (reduced \ngreenhouse gas)  \nElectricity  \nWaste/Waste water  \nWaste recycle  \nOthers (estimate 15% of total \ngreenhouse gas emission from \nother sectors) \nGreen area  \nTotal \n\nFuture Greenhouse Gas Emissions \n(2012) \n\nBusiness-as-Usual \nScenario \n(MtCO2eq) \n\nBMA Action Plan \nImplementation \n(MtCO2eq) \n\n2012 \n\n25.30 \n \n\n16 \n1.13 \n \n6.36 \n\n(0.10) \n48.69 \n\n19.77 \n(0.61) \n\n13.75 \n0.95 \n(0.28) \n6.36 \n\n(1.00) \n38.94 \n\nGreenhouse Gas \nEmissions in 2007 \n(MtCO2eq) \n2007 \n21.18 \n \n\n14.86 \n1.13 \n \n5.58 \n\n(0.10) \n42.65 \n\n34 \n \n\nBMA = Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, MtCO2eq = millions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.. \n\nSource: Bangkok Metropolitan Administration 2007. \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nImplication  of  BMA  policy  and  action.  Other  implications  stem  from  implementation  of  the \nAction  Plan  on  Global  Warming  Mitigation,  the  key  one  being  improved  environmental  quality \nand livelihood of people in the Bangkok metropolitan area. Several activities directly contribute \nto  this  improvement,  such  as  improved  public  transport  and  traffic  systems,  the  promotion  of \nbiofuel consumption, and enhancement of green areas. \n\n2.3.2  Other Areas \n\nThere are other areas pursuing greenhouse gas emissions reduction at the local level through a \nvariety  of    approaches.  The  key  examples  of  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  initiatives \nbeing implemented are described in the following sections. \n\n2.3.2.1  Four Low-Carbon Cities  \n\nA cooperation initiative between the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization and \nlocal  municipalities  aims  to  develop  low-carbon  city  models  in  four  participating  cities\u2014\nMuangklang Municipality, Phuket City, Sikhiu City, and Amphawa Municipality. One of the main \noutcomes  of  the  project  is  a  handbook  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  at  the \nmunicipality  level.  This  handbook  can  then  be  used  to  create  low-carbon  cities  in  other \nmunicipalities. \n\n2.3.2.2  Phalaui Island  \n\nPhalaui Island is a small island in SuratThanni province, with a population of less than 500. The \nDepartment of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) of the Ministry of Energy \nis implementing a number of green energy measures and technologies in order to develop the \nisland  into  a  demonstration  green  community,  with  effective  energy  management  and  green \nenergy  technologies.  Solar  power  and  wind  power  are  utilized  to  generate  electricity.  The \nproject  also  supports  the  utilization  and/or  reutilization  of  biomass,  biogas,  and  biofuel. \nAdditionally, the use of high-energy-efficiency light bulbs, electrical motors, efficient stoves, and \nsolar-powered drying beds (for producing dried food) is encouraged to improve the livelihood of \npeople, energy use, and the island\u2019s environment. Project completion is expected in 2015, and \nreductions of approximately 250 tons of CO\n\neq/year are forecasted (Ministry of Energy 2011b). \n\n2\n\n2.3.2.3  Samui Island  \n\nOn  Samui  Island  there  are  several  \u201cgreen  island\u201d  and  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction \ninitiatives  being  separately  implemented.  These  are  initiated  by  government  agencies,  private \npartnership,  and  nongovernment  organization\u2013private  sector  collaboration.  Green  island \napproaches  include  energy  efficiency,  waste  management,  and  natural  resource  protection. \nBecause there are several fragmented initiatives being implemented by many stakeholders, and \na  lack  of  willingness  to  cooperate,  it  is  difficult  to  have  much  impact  on  reducing  greenhouse \ngas emissions. \n\n2.3.3  Summary of Subnational Pledges and Actions \n\nSubnational  pledges  and  actions  for  mitigating  greenhouse  gas  emissions  can  be  found  in \nseveral areas in Thailand, including big cities, small cities, and tourist destinations (Table 2.14). \nThese  pledges  and  actions  are \nimplemented  by  government  agencies, \nnongovernment  agencies,  and  the  private  sector,  with  the  aims  of  reducing  greenhouse  gas \nemissions  and  creating  carbon  sinks.  This  will  be  achieved  by  using  renewable  energy \ntechnology, energy efficiency, extending public transport, and afforestation and reforestation. \n\ninitiated  and \n\n35 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n\nTable 2.14: Summary of Subnational Pledges and Actions \n\nGreenhouse Gas \nReduction \n\n9.75 MtCO2eq in \n2012  \n\nPledges and Actions \n\nExpanding the mass transit rail system \n\nPromoting the use of renewable energy \n\nImproving building electricity consumption \nefficiency \n\nImproving solid-waste management and \nwastewater treatment efficiency \n\nExpanding park area \n\nReduced Carbon Footprint for Low-Carbon City \n\nCannot determine  \n\nArea \n\nBangkok \n\n1.

Renewable  energy  and energy  efficiency  are  the key  potentials.  Based \nupon the evaluation of the ENCON program, the investments for renewable energy and energy \nefficiency  in  Thailand  provide  significant  benefits for  the  country.  Financial  benefits created  by \nenergy saving are greater than financial investment on renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects (EPPO Undated). The financial benefits originate from energy saving and reduction of \nimported energy. Currently, Thailand has high energy intensity, at 16.2 ktoe/billion baht in 2005, \nand  also  has  high  energy  elasticity  at  0.98  (average  for  the  last  20  years)  (Ministry  of  Energy \n2011a).  Based  on  the  cost\u2013benefit  estimation  for  the  spending  budget  and  financial  benefits \nfrom energy saving, financial benefits are greater than the spending budget. Thus, if Thailand is \nable to increase energy efficiency (reduce energy elasticity and energy intensity), this will create \na decoupling scenario. \n\nA  number  of  potential  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  technologies  in  many  sectors \nhave  potential  for  the  decoupling  of  economic  development  and  low-carbon  emissions.  In  the \nindustry  sector,  efficient  furnaces,  boilers,  arc  furnaces,  chillers,  air  compressors,  and  motors \nhave negative abatement costs. In the commercial and residential sector, efficient LPG stoves, \ncompact fluorescent lamps, and air conditioners (Energy Label No.5) have negative abatement \ncosts.  In  the  energy  and  power  sector,  biomass  and  biomass  technologies  have  negative \nabatement costs (Limmeechokchai et al. 2009). \n\n36 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nIn  Thailand,  the  main  obstacles  to  promoting  decoupling  for  economic  development  and  low-\ncarbon emissions relate to technologies and behavioral changes.6\n \n\n2.5  Government Strategies for Private Sector Inclusion \n\nThe  Government  of  Thailand  directed  the  policies,  strategies,  and  measures  to  include  the \nprivate sector in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Private involvement in greenhouse gas \nemissions reduction is witnessed in the improvement of energy efficiency and the development \nof renewable energy. The Revolving Fund, ESCO Fund, and SPP and VSPP programs are the \nkey milestones for private sector inclusion for greenhouse gas emissions reduction because the \nenergy and power sector has never before had such deep participation from the private sector. \nCommercial banks, energy service companies, and investors (in renewable energy and energy \nefficiency) are included in implementation mechanisms for greenhouse gas mitigation. \n\nIt should be noted that voluntary implementation of greenhouse gas emissions reduction can be \neffective.  For  example,  the  Energy  Efficiency  Label  and  CDM  are  voluntary  measures  that \ninvolve  the  private  sector  and  are  effective  in  mitigating  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  It  is  also \nnoted  that  financial  incentives  may  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  effectiveness  and  success  of  the \nmeasures implemented in the private sector.  \n\nThe  other  thing  to  note  is  that  the  private  sector  is  very  effective  in  implementing  renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency projects. As soon as there are windows of opportunity, the private \nsector  will  initiate  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  works  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions. \n\n2.6  Major Strengths and Weakness of Current Policy Actions and \n\nStrategies \n\nThe following are the strengths and weaknesses of current key policies and plans pertaining to \nrenewable energy, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. \n\n2.6.1  Overview of Strengths \n\n2.6.1.1  Comprehensive Plans and Actions for Addressing Renewable Energy and Energy \n\nEfficiency \n\nSeveral  factors  have  been  taken  into  account  in  formulating  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency  plans.  Several  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  availability  of  potentials  and \nresources.  These  results  were  incorporated  into  the  formulation  of  renewable  energy  and \nenergy efficiency plans. \n\nOne of the fundamental factors that can promote the decoupling of economic development and \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  is  the  utilization  of  local  and  abandoned  resources.  It  is \nevident that renewable energy and energy efficiency plans acknowledged the availability of local \nand  abandoned  resources,  such  as  using  agricultural  biomass  for  producing  energy,  using  oil \npalm and sugar cane for producing biofuels, and using municipal wastes and animal wastes for \ngenerating biogas. \n\n                                                \n6 \n\nThese obstacles are elaborated upon in Section 2.6.2. \n\n37 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n2.6.1.2 \n\nInnovative Measures \n\nThe  Government  of  Thailand  has  adopted  a  number  of  innovative  measures  to  promote  the \ndevelopment and utilization of renewable energy and energy efficiency. These include financial \nincentives,  fiscal  incentives,  direct  subsidies,  and  barrier  removal  for  the  deployment  of \nenvironmentally  friendly  technologies.  Some  measures  can  eliminate  financial  barriers  and \nreduce  other  concerns  for  investors  and  entrepreneurs  with  regard  to  the  promotion  of \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency. \n\n2.6.1.3  Public\u2013Private Partnership \n\nThe government policies and strategies allow the private sector to take charge in implementing \nrenewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  measures.  For  renewable  energy,  SPPs  and  VSPPs, \nwhere private investors can invest in the power generation industry and supply electricity to the \nElectricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT),  are  clear  examples  of  public\u2013private \npartnership. In the case of energy conservation and efficiency, the Revolving Fund and ESCO \nFund,  where  investors  and  commercial  banks  participate  in  developing  renewable  energy  and \nenergy efficiency projects, are explicit forms of public\u2013private partnership. With such an active \nprivate  sector  role,  the  development  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  will  be  further \nadvanced. \n\n2.6.2  Overview of Weaknesses \n\n2.6.2.1  Lack of Financial Incentives \n\nEven  though  a  number  of  incentives  are  provided  for  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency \nprojects,  they  may  not  overcome  the  financial  investment  of  some  projects,  where  the \ninvestment cost is very high. Wind energy and solar energy are examples of renewable energy \nprojects where this applies. \n\n2.6.2.2  Need for Resource Management  \n\nA conflict over resource use is a concern for promoting renewable energy. Local resources and \nabandoned  materials  can  become  valuable  when  there  are  increasing  demands  for  such \nresources. Additionally, some resources can be utilized for many purposes; e.g., rice husks are \na  common  agricultural  residue  in  Thailand,  and  they  can  be  used  for  electricity  generation  for \nthe cement industry and for agricultural activities. Such a situation can create a conflict for the \nresources.  As  a  result,  it  is  essential  for  concerned  parties  to  plan  and  manage  resource \nutilization. \n\n2.6.2.3  Lack of Cooperation and Aggregation of Fragmented Efforts \n\nFrom  time  to  time,  mitigation  actions  and  projects  have  been  implemented  in  one  geographic \narea  by  several  groups.  Some  of  these  activities  and  program  have  the  same  goal  and \nobjective, but they are implemented by different groups. In this situation, there may be overlap \nof  the  work  and  conflicts  among  the  implementation  groups.  For  effective  implementation  in \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, there should be cooperation among all groups carrying out \nthe activities. This can be achieved by drafting a clear plan and targets with the involvement of \nall stakeholders. \n\n2.6.2.4  Low Civil Society Involvement \n\nIt is noticeable that greenhouse gas reduction policies and actions concerning civil society are \nmostly  awareness  rising  and  promotional  campaigns.  These  measures  and  actions  do  not \n\n38 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \ncreate a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emission from civil society. As a result, it is \ndifficult  to  set  a  clear  target  for  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  and  to  actually  reduce \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions.  Thus,  it  may  be  useful  to  consider  the  policies  and  measures  to \npromote greenhouse gas reductions among civil society by involving people at a deeper level. \nProviding incentives (such as providing financial incentives for reducing electricity consumption) \nand \nto \ncommunities) are some examples of deeper engagement with civil society. \n\nfacilitating  environmentally \n\nrecycling  points  close \n\nfriendly  behaviors \n\n(placing \n\n2.6.2.5 \n\nInconsistent Policy Implementation \n\nSeveral  well-planned  policies  and  programs  are  implemented  and  provide  many  benefits. \nHowever,  sometimes  these  policies  and  programs  are  interrupted  during  implementation  by \npolitical  issues.  Low  political  stability  is  one  cause  of  inconsistent  policy  implementation  in \nThailand.  For  example,  a  policy  of  the  former  government  may  be  altered,  modified,  or \ndiscontinued by the new government. \n\n2.6.3  Weaknesses at Sector and Subnational Levels \n\n2.6.3.1  Energy and Power Sector \n\nLow Level of Research and Development \n\nThe level of R&D in new renewable energy technologies in Thailand is still low. This is a major \nobstacle  to  promoting  renewable  energy  in  the  country;  most  technologies  have  to  be \ntransferred  from  other  countries.  The  cost  for  such  technologies,  such  as  solar,  is  also  high, \ncausing  problems  for  deployment.  Additionally,  some  imported  technologies,  such  as  for \nbiomass  and  biogas,  may  not  be  completely  suitable  to  Thailand  (they  may  not  give  high \nefficiency). \n\nInsufficient Incentive to Invest in Small and Very Small Power Producers \n\nCurrently, SPP and VSPP programs provide a number of incentives for investment in renewable \nenergy, including the adder costs. However, technologies for some types of renewable energy \nhave  relatively  high  investment  costs  compared  to  the  benefits.  As  a  result,  private \nentrepreneurs have little interest in investing in such projects, leaving only government agencies \nto make the investments. \n\nLow Local Community Engagement and Incentives \n\nWhen establishing renewable energy power plants it is important to have the agreement of local \npeople  in  the  area to  proceed  with  the  project. A  common method  used  to gain  access  to  the \narea  is  public  hearing  (during  the  environmental  impact  assessment  process),  but  these  may \nnot be sufficient for local people to agree to build the project. Thus, it may be useful to increase \nthe engagement (such as forming a committee for the project) and to provide incentives (such \nas free electricity) for local communities. \n\n2.6.3.2  Building Sector \nLow Awareness of Green Building  \n\nGreen  building  awareness  is  still  low  in  Thailand.  Most  entrepreneurs  of  designated  buildings \nonly  concern  themselves  with  energy  efficiency  and  energy  management  in  buildings,  and  do \nnot  pay  attention  to  other  aspects  of  green  buildings,  such  as  building  maintenance. \nFurthermore,  entrepreneurs  of  nondesignated  buildings  are  barely  concerned  about  energy \nefficiency and energy management. \n\n39 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nNo Green Building Concept for Small Buildings and Condominiums  \n\nThe  green  building  concept  for  new  large  buildings  and  new  homes  has  developed  and  been \nmodified  over  the  years to  suit Thailand\u2019s  climate.  Experience gained from  applying  the green \nbuilding concept to large buildings can be used when constructing new large buildings, but the \ngreen building concept and guidelines for small buildings and residential complexes have yet to \nbe  developed.  Thus,  it  is  difficult  for  entrepreneurs  to  apply  green  building  concepts  to  small \nbuildings. \n\n2.6.3.3  Transport Sector \nLow Price Difference between Gasoline and Gasohol \n\nA  change  in  fuel  price  in  Thailand  in  mid-August  2011  due  to  a  policy  change  (tax  being \ncollected for the Oil Fund) saw the price gap between gasoline 91 and gasohol 91 reduced from \nB7.80 per liter to B3.03 per liter (PTT 2011). This change may affect biofuel consumption. With \nthe smaller price difference, people may turn to gasoline instead of gasohol.  \n\nPriority for Transport Policy \n\nPrivate  vehicle  ownership  is  driven  by  economic  growth.  If  there  is  high  economic  growth  in \ncoming years, there will be more private vehicles on the road (more motorcycles and higher shift \nfrom owning motorcycles to private cars), which will continue to cause traffic problems and air \npollution, and consume fuel. Thus, it is essential for the government to prioritize its public and \nnonmotorized transport policies (Pongthanaisawan and Sorapipatana 2010). \n\n2.6.3.4  Agriculture Sector \n\nLack of Local Climate Change Information \n\nThere  is  insufficient  climate  change  data  to  be  utilized  for  agricultural  planning.  As  a  result, \nagriculture  planning  with  regard  to  the  changing  environment  and  climate  cannot  be  done, \nespecially for suitable plantation area, type of crops or plants, agricultural product storage, and \nwater movement and reservoirs. Additionally, without the ability to project future climate change \nscenarios for agriculture, technology transfer for agriculture cannot properly be initiated. \n\nLack of Clear Agricultural Planning Concerning Food versus Fuel \n\nBecause fertile land is limited, it is important to have an agricultural plan in terms of what crops \nto plant, where to plant them, and how large the plantation area for each crop or plant should \nbe.  The  concern  about  land  availability  is  intensified  by  the  production  of  biofuel.  Most  biofuel \ntechnologies being used in Thailand are first-generation technologies, which require the use of \nfood crops and plants (e.g., oil palm and sugar cane). Currently, the planning issues concerning \nfood versus fuel have not yet been clearly addressed.  \n\n2.6.3.5  Waste Sector \n\nLack  of  Understanding  between  Government  Agencies  and  Local  Communities  on  Municipal \nWaste Reutilization \n\nIn  addition  to  the  issue  of  waste  management  (recycling  rate  and  waste  generation  rate), \nreutilization  of  municipal  waste  remains  a  problem.  One  obstacle  is  that  there  is  a  lack  of \nunderstanding  of  waste  reutilization  between  local  government  and  local  communities. \nCurrently, local people are concerned by the potential impacts of waste reutilization projects; as \na result, they do not want to have such projects near their communities.

This  type  of  implementation  can  be  easily  achieved;  however,  the  magnitude  of \nsuccess  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  may  not  be  high,  and  these  low-carbon \nactivities  may  be  unsustainable  because  they  lack  cooperation  and  involvement  of  all \nstakeholders. \n\n2.7  Major Challenges in Technology Resource Mobilization and \n\nPrivate and Public Finance \n\n2.7.1  Technology and Resource Mobilization \n\n2.7.1.1  Low Level of Research and Development \n\nIn  Thailand,  the  level  of  research  and  development  for  new  clean  and  green  technologies  in \nrenewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  and  other  areas  concerning  climate  change  is  low.  Most \nclean  and  green  technologies,  especially  sophisticated  technologies,  are  deployed  in  the \ncountry  through  technology  transfer.  Deploying  clean  and  green  technologies  from  other \ncountries has high costs and, as a result, the deployment rate is low. This is because small and \nmedium-sized enterprises have financial difficulty in deploying such technologies. \n\nThe  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  is  an  effective  mechanism  that  can  reduce  the \nbarriers  to  deploying  clean  and  green  technologies.  However,  the  technologies  that  can  be \nfacilitated through the CDM are limited, as only technologies of a certain type and scale can be \ntransferred through the CDM. \n\n2.7.1.2  Mobilization of Clean and Green Technologies for Commercial Purposes \n\nSome  research  and  development  activities  for  clean  and  green  technologies  are  being \ndomestically  undertaken  on  a  pilot  scale.  These  technologies  have  the  potential  to  alleviate \nenvironmental  problems  and  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  However,  some  fail  to  be \nadopted  commercially  because  manufacturers  do  not  see  the  market  potential  (do  not  create \nthe  supply)  and  government  agencies  do  not  promote  and  support  the  emergence  of \ntechnologies (do not create the demand). \n\n2.7.2  Private and Public Finance \n\n2.7.2.1  Public Finance \n\nPublic finance is the primary financial source for supporting green and low-carbon development \nin Thailand. The Energy Conservation Promotion Fund (ENCON Fund) is the key public finance \nsupport for government agencies,  state  enterprises,  nongovernment  organizations,  individuals, \nand  businesses  in  implementing  energy  conservation,  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy \ndevelopment,  energy-related  technology  development,  human  resource  development  and \ntraining, and public awareness campaigns. \n\nThe  ENCON  Fund  was  established  in  1992  with  an  initial  budget  of  B1.5  billion.  The  primary \nsources  of  revenue  for  the  fund  are  petroleum  taxes,  bank  interest,  and  irregular  government \n\n41 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nand  private  budgets.  Since  the  establishment  of  the  fund,  the  budget  has  been  allotted  to \nfacilitate  the  implementation  of  programs  and  activities  under  the  ENCON  program,  such  as \nenergy conservation and efficiency, renewable energy development, technology demonstration, \nresearch and development for technologies, and raising awareness.  \n\nUnder the ENCON program, during 2005\u20132007 energy conservation and efficiency activities to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  energy  consumption  in  the  industry,  building,  commercial  and \nresidential,  transport,  and  government  office  sectors  created  energy  savings  of  about  1,554 \nktoe/year, and renewable energy promotion activities created renewable energy substitution of \ncrude  oil  of  about  3,586  ktoe/year.  These  activities  created  savings  of  about  B95.79  billion \n(EPPO 2008). \n\nSince  the  establishment  of  the  ENCON  Fund,  the  actual  spending  budget  of  the  ENCON \nprogram for developing renewable energy and improving energy efficiency has been lower than \nthe estimated budget. This is because the implemented renewable energy and energy efficiency \nactivities  have  also  been  less  than  estimated.  As  a  result,  the  key  challenge  regarding  public \nfunding  is  to  fully  utilize  the  budget  of  the  ENCON  program  to  improve  the  implementation  of \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency activities. \n\nThe budget of the ENCON Fund to execute such energy- and environment-related activities was \nestimated  at  B19.21  billion  (approximately  equivalent  to  $620  million)  during  2007\u20132011 \n(ENCON Fund 2011). \n\n2.7.2.2  Private Finance \n\nThe role of the private sector in supporting the development of green and low-carbon initiatives \nis  perceived from the  emergence  of  private finance.  Currently,  the  Revolving  Fund  and  ESCO \nFund  are  public\u2013private  partnerships for  promoting  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  in \nThailand. \n\nRevolving Fund \n\nAs part of the government's initiate to involve the private sector in terms of finance, the public\u2013\nprivate partnership between the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency \n(DEDE)  and  private  financial  institutions  was  established  in  2003  with  the  Revolving  Fund  for \npromoting energy conservation and efficiency, and renewable energy. The fund provides loans \nwith a maximum fixed interest rate of 4% over 7 year with a grace period of not more than 12 \nmonths.  The  maximum  lending  amount  is  B50  million.  In  general,  the  ratio  for  financial \ncontribution  for  the  lending  amount  is  1:1  between  the  government  agency  and  the  bank \n(Sutabutr 2010). \n\nThe Revolving Fund is an effective program in terms of creating private finance for investing in \nenergy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects,  creating  energy  and  fuel  savings,  and \ngenerating financial  savings. In  the first  phase  of  the  Revolving  Fund,  participation  of financial \ninstitutes was limited to six banks. In the second and third phases, participation increased to 11 \nparticipating financial institutions (Asawutmangkul 2010).  \n\nAdditionally,  the  budget  of  the  Revolving  Fund  has  been  continuously  allocated  from  the \nENCON  Fund.  The  cumulative  budget  being  allotted  to  the  Revolving  Fund  is  currently  more \nthan B7 billion (DEDE 2011b), and the ratio of private finance in the fund program has increased \nsteadily over the years (Table 2.15).  \n\n42 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n\nTable 2.15: Financial Details of Revolving Fund \n\nPeriod \n\nEnergy \nConser-\nvation 3 \nRenew-\nable \nenergy 1 \n2/8/2007 \n to \n1/8/2010 \n81 \n\nEnergy \nConservat\nion 3 \n(Addition-\nal) \n2/8/2007 \n to \n1/8/2010 \n23 \n\nEnergy \nConser-\nvation 4 \n2/9/2009 \n to \n1/9/2012 \n11 \n\nEnergy \nConser-\nvation 5 \n1/6/2010 \nto  \n31/5/2013 \n2 \n\nEnergy \nConser-\nvation 1 \n30/1/2003 \nto \n29/1/2006 \n\n78 \n\n3,427 \n\nEnergy \nConser-\nvation 2 \n17/3/2006 \n to \n6/3/2009 \n85 \n\n3,536 \n\n3,812 \n\n2,576 \n\n1,272 \n\n20 \n\n14,643 \n\n2,000 \n\n2,000 \n\n2,000 \n\n942.5 \n\n1,902 \n\n1,805 \n\n1,988 \n\n865 \n\n1,525 \n\n1,731 \n\n1,824 \n\n1,711 \n\n251 \n\n232 \n\n301 \n\n219 \n\n81 \n\n88 \n\n36 \n\n1,394 \n\n1,415 \n\n1,092 \n\n21 \n\n751 \n\n400 \n\n383 \n\n889 \n\n103 \n\n5 \n\n302 \n\nTotal \n\n280 \n\n500 \n\n7,842.5 \n\n20 \n\n6,963 \n\n0 \n\n2 \n\n7,680 \n\n1,108 \n\n0.2 \n\n231.2 \n\n7 \n\n4,961 \n\nDetails \nApproved project \n\nInvestment cost (B \nmillion) \nBudget size of the \nfund (B million) \nApproved budget for \nenergy efficiency and \nrenewable energy  \nprojects (million Baht) \nBanks\u2019 lending \namount (B million) \n\nElectricity saving \n(million kilowatt-hours \n/yr) \nFuel saving (million \nliter/yr) \n\nTotal financial saving \n(B million/yr) \n\nReduction of \nimported crude oil \n(thousand tons of oil \nequivalent/yr) \n\n97.60 \n\n102.45 \n\n59.27 \n\n38.74 \n\n13.21 \n\n0.37 \n\n311.64 \n\nNote: The data are as of October 2011 \n\nSource: Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency 2011b.  \n\nIt  can  clearly  be  seen  that  there  are  interesting  benefits  from  the  Revolving  Fund  in  terms  of \nenergy and fuel savings, and financial savings. As of September 2010, it is estimated that the \nRevolving  Fund,  with  total  investment  B14.64  billion  (both  government  and  private  finances), \ncan reduce the import of crude oil by 311.6 ktoe per year and can generate financial savings of \nB4.97 billion per year (DEDE 2011b). \n\nInterestingly,  the  Revolving  Fund  program  can  prompt  financial  institutions  to  create  lending \nprograms for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects (interest rates are negotiable). It \nis  estimated  that  the  lending  amount  from  financial  institutions  is  about  B70  billion  (Sutabutr \n2010).  \n\nESCO Fund \n\nThe ESCO Fund is a government co-investment scheme to support ESCOs and other investors \nin investing in clean energy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and building retrofit projects. \nThe  support  is  categorized  into  equity  investment, venture  capital  investment,  carbon  credit \ntrading,  equipment  leasing,  technical  assistance,  and  credit  guarantee.  The  fund  was \nestablished in 2008 with an initial budget of B500 million from the ENCON Fund. The Energy for \nEnvironment  Foundation  and  the  Energy  Conservation  Foundation  of  Thailand  are  fund \nmanagers. \n\n43 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nDuring  the  implementation  period  of  2009\u20132010,  B527.08  million  was  invested  in  39  energy \nefficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects,  with  total  investment  of  B5.11  billion.  These  energy \nefficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects  can  create  energy  savings  of  20.61  ktoe/year  and \nfinancial savings of B721.36 million per year (DEDE 2011c). \n\nIn  short,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  public  and  private  financial  mechanism  to  promote  energy \nefficiency  and  renewable  energy  begins  to  work  when  there  is  deeper  participation  from \nfinancial  institutions  (more  institutions  and  larger  lending  amounts)  and  environmental  and \nfinancial benefits from the programs. However, challenges for private finance for green and low-\ncarbon  development  remains,  one  of  the  key  ones  being  creating  green  finance  for  other \nenvironmental \nlow-carbon \nimprovements  (other  than  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy)  are  offered  by  only  one \nfinancial  institution,  Krungthai  Bank,  which  received  financial  support  from  the  Environmental \nFund of the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning. The challenge, \ntherefore,  is  for  concerned  agencies  and  financial  institutions  to  create  green  soft  loans  for \nentrepreneurs,  especially  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  for  investing  in  environmental \nimprovement programs.  \n\nimprovements.

ACHIEVING LOW-CARBON GREEN ASIA 2050  \n\n3.1  The Role of Lifestyle Choices, National Innovation Systems and \n\nTechnology Transfer, and Market-Based Instruments in Achieving \nVoluntary Targets, and the Costs Involved \n\nIn the past several years, numerous initiatives and activities have been implemented to mitigate \ngreenhouse gas  emissions  in Thailand.  Because Thailand  is  a  non-Annex  I  party to  the  Kyoto \nProtocol,  all  mitigation  actions  are  taken  voluntarily,  with  the  aim  of  being  part  of  the  global \naction in reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions and alleviating the impacts of climate \nchange. \n\nWhile there is no clear voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction target in Thailand, it has \nbeen  recognized  that  it  is  crucial  for  all  nations  to  undertake  greenhouse  gas  mitigation.  As  a \nresult, the Government of Thailand and other sectors have initiated a number of initiatives and \nactions  to  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  However,  emissions  reduction  in  regards  to \ngreen lifestyle, national systems and technology transfer, and market-based instruments is still \nin the initial stage of development. \n\n3.1.1  Green Consumer and Lifestyle\u2014Emerging Yet? \n\nWhen discussing green consumers and lifestyle choices, there are many consumption practices \ninvolved\u2014food consumption, travel mode choices, and leisure practices (Spaargaren 2003). All \nof  these  practices  contribute  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions  to  varying  degrees.  Within  each \npractice,  there  are  choices  for  consumers,  and  each  choice  has  different  greenhouse  gas \nemission  implications.  For  example,  a  person  going  to  the  office  by  personal  car  may  cause \nhigher  greenhouse  gas  emissions  than  someone  taking  public  transport.  In  general,  it  is  well \nunderstood that green products and services have less environmental impacts (they may cause \nless greenhouse gas emissions).  \n\nIn  Thailand,  green  consumers  and  lifestyles  are  the  key  challenges  for  reaching  sustainable \ndevelopment. Green products and services have been increasing in recent years, but the green \nmarket  in  Thailand  is  still  limited  because  there  are  few  green  consumers  who  consider \n\n44 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nenvironmental factors when making purchases (Pollution Control Department [PCD] 2006). Thai \nconsumers  are  price-sensitive  consumers,  and  the  prices  of  green  products  are  higher  than \nthose of non-green products. \n\nDespite a low number of green consumers, there are signs of increasing awareness in terms of \nfood consumption. Organic food is becoming a viable green movement in Thailand. This green \nmovement is active in engaging both green producers and green consumers, and in providing \ninformation  to  consumers. 7\n  Additionally,  retail  shops  selling  organic  products  and  healthy \nproducts in Thailand are increasing. The government, as the largest consumer in the nation, has \nenforced a green procurement policy with the hope of increasing the demand for green products \nand  services  (PCD  2006).  All  government  agencies  are  obligated  to  comply  with  the  green \nprocurement policy. \n\nThe emergence of green food consumers and demand for green products and services created \nby the government forecasts a promising future for an increase in green consumers and green \nconsumption in Thailand. However, there may be a need for the government and private sector \nto  further  implement  measures  to  create  green  demands  from  consumers.  This  could  be \naddressed  by  using  both  short-term  and  long-term  measures,  e.g.,  providing  incentives  for \npurchasing  green  products  and  services  (short  term)  or  providing  education  and  raising \nawareness (long term).  \n3.1.1  National Innovation Systems and Technology Transfer \n\n3.1.1.1  National Innovation System \n\nEnergy Efficiency Label (Energy Label No.5) \n\nEnergy  Label  No.5  is  an  interesting  innovation  to  promote  energy  efficiency  in  the  residential \nsector in Thailand. As a demand-side management (DSM) program, Energy Label No.5, which \nwas  started  in  1991,  is  the  key  program  undertaken  by  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of \nThailand (EGAT). This label program is free and voluntary\u2014appliance producers do not need to \npay to participate in the program. The program's key objectives are to (i) encourage producers \nto manufacture and/or import energy efficient products, (ii) provide energy efficient products to \nend  users,  (iii)  educate  people  about  energy  and  energy  efficiency,  and  (iv)  efficiently  utilize \nenergy in the country.  \n\nThe program uses a label (efficiency scale range from No.1 to No.5, with No.5 being the highest \nefficiency  level)  to  communicate  to  consumers  about  energy  efficiency,  energy  consumption, \nand  electricity  cost  information  of  appliances  (the  details  of  the  label  for  each  appliance  may \ndiffer from one to another, but the key message to consumers is the same\u2014energy efficiency of \nthe  appliance).  The  program  began  labeling  a  few  high-energy-use  home  appliances\u2014\nrefrigerators and air conditioners\u2014by running commercial campaigns promoting the label to the \npublic  and  providing  details  of  financial  benefits  that  consumers  could  get  from  using  certified \nproducts.  As  a  consequence  of  the  promotion  and  campaign,  the  label  is  highly  recognized \namong  Thai  people,  and  end-users  tend  to  select  products  that  have  high  efficiency.  With  an \nactive  demand-side  movement,  producers  have  improved  the  energy  efficiency  of  products  to \ngain the trust of end-users and increase sales (Na Phuket and Prijyanonda 2000). The program \nis successful and EGAT has expanded the program to cover a broad range of home appliances. \nAdditionally, EGAT periodically rescales the certification criteria of Energy Label No.5 for each \nproduct,  and  appliance  producers  keep  pace  with  the  tightening  energy  efficiency  criteria, \nresulting in increased appliance efficiency.  \n\n                                                \n7 An example of a green network is Thaigreenmarket. http://www.thaigreenmarket.com/ \n\n45 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nAs a result of this dynamic between EGAT, appliance producers, and end-users, the successful \nprogram  has  generated  multiple  benefits,  the  key  ones  being  the  level  of  energy  efficiency  of \nproducts,  energy  and  financial  savings,  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Energy \nsavings  are  a  result  of  the  use  of  high-energy-efficient  products  nationwide.  This  reduces \nelectricity demand and the need to construct new power plants. With reduced energy demand, \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  from  energy  production  and  consumption  are  simultaneously \nreduced by the label program. Box 3 shows the implementation and key implementation results \nof the label program. \n\n \n\nImplementation: \n\nBox 3: Case Study: Energy Efficiency Label (Energy Label No.5) \n\n\uf06c  The label is part of a demand-side management program to reduce energy consumption \n\nof high energy consumption products.  \n\n\uf06c  Certification  began  with  a  few  products  and  expanded  to  a  wider  range  of  products \ncovering refrigerators, air conditioners, compact fluorescent lamps, ballasts, electric fans, \nrice cookers, electric lamps, electric water boilers, televisions, and monitors.  \n\n\uf06c  The program is very effective as it is promoted through TV campaigns that inform about \nthe  savings  that  can  be  realized  when  using  energy  efficient  appliances.  This  creates \nhigh recognition among end users. Consequently, people tend to purchase certified (high \nefficiency)  appliances,  with  the  result  that  producers  improve  the  energy  efficiency  of \nproducts. \n\nKey results and implications: \n\n\uf06c  The  World  Bank  estimated  that  the  use  of  energy  efficiency  lighting,  refrigerators, \nand air conditioners (Energy Efficient Label) as a result of the program has reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 12.6\u201317.4 MtCO2eq during 1993\u20132004 and additional \n14.7\u201327.6 MtCO2eq during 2005\u20132010 (World Bank 2006). \n\n\uf06c  As  of  February  2007,  energy  savings  from  certified  refrigerators  and  air  conditioners \n\n(highest efficiency label) are estimated at 1,000 megawatts.  \n\n\uf06c  As  of  February  2007,  greenhouse  gas  emission  reductions  created  by  certified \nrefrigerators and air conditioners (highest efficiency label) are estimated at 4 MtCO2eq. \n\nProduct \nAir Conditioners \n\nNumber of \nissued labels \n18,272,449 \n\nRefrigerators \n\n5,995,192 \n\nSource: EGAT 2009a, 2009b \n\nEnergy saving \n\nGWh \n2,416.0 \n\n3,278.5 \n\nMW \n\n254.2 \n\n743.4 \n\nGreenhouse \nGas \nEmissions \nReduction \n(Tons of \nCO2eq) \n\n1,763,799 \n\n2,195,029 \n\n\uf06c  People recognize the label and consider the label when purchasing electrical appliances. \n\n\uf06c  Manufacturers can continuously improve energy efficiency of products to meet with the \n\ntightening criteria of the label, which are rescaled approximately every 5 years.  \n\nMtCO2eq = million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nSmall Power Producer and Very Small Power Producer Program \n\nThe  SPP  and  VSPP  program  is  an  innovative  system  to  stimulate  the  utilization  of  renewable \nenergy  in  Thailand.  Reform  of  the  power  sector  started  in  1992  with  the  introduction  of  the \nPurchase Power from Small Power Producers (SPP) Regulation. The regulation allows private \ncompanies to be a part of the national power supply. The Independent Power Producers (IPPs) \nprogram (for large power producers) is a beginning point that brings private investment to power \ngeneration activity, which can be viewed as a starting point of the SPP and VSPP program. \n\nInitially, the SPP and VSPP program was ineffective and underwent several changes to  policy, \nfinancial and investment systems, institutional conditions, and economic situation. Only recently \nhas  the  SPP  and  VSPP  program  provided  significant  contributions  to  the  development  of \nrenewable energy, enhancement of energy security, and structure of the power sector. \n\nThe fundamental concept of the SPP and VSPP program is to provide more practical and more \ninvestor-friendly  regulations  by  modifying  criteria  for  qualifying  as  a  facility,  calculation  of  the \navoided  cost,  and  interconnection  requirements.  The  details  of  the  current  SPP  and  VSPP \nprogram are as follows: \n\n1.  Cogeneration facilities  are  applicable to  the  SPP  and  VSPP  program. The  power that  can \n\nbe sold from the facility is 10\u201390 MW for SPPs and not more than 10 MW for VSPPs. \n\n2.  SPP cogeneration facilities can have a long-term contract for selling power to the grid.  \n\n3.  The  feed-in  tariff  for  SPPs  and  VSPPs  using  renewable  energy  is  increased.  An  adder  is \nprovided  over  the  normal  tariff  rate  for  SPPs  and  VSPPs  that  use  renewable  energy  with \nthe duration of 7\u201310 years (from the commercial operation date). Table 3.1 shows the adder \nprovided to SPPs and VSPPs. \n\n4.

The \nnumbers  of  renewable  energy  projects,  generation  capacity,  diversification  of  energy  sources, \nand  proposed  power  for  selling  to  the  grid  have  increased  markedly.  The  impact  of  the  new \npolicy on VSPPs is particularly high.  \n \n \n\n48 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n\nBox 4: Case Study: Small Power Producer and Very Small Power Producer Program \n(Renewable Energy) \n\nImplementation: \n\n\u2022  Encouraging private sector to participate in renewable energy development. \n\n\u2022  Providing several incentives for eligible projects (e.g., biomass, biogas, municipal waste, \n\nwind, hydropower, and solar). \n\n\u2022 \n\nIncentives include feed-in tariff, subsidy, technical assistance, and soft loans. \n\nKey result of implementation and implication: \n\n\u2022  The emergence of renewable energy utilization projects in Thailand. \n\no  As of June 2011 there were 57 renewable energy small power producer  projects \n(proposed,  under  consideration,  or  operational),  which  can  sell  2,201.62 \nmegawatts (MW) of power to the grid (EPPO 2011). \n\no  As of June 2011, there were 1,330 renewable energy VSPP projects (proposed, \nunder consideration, or operational)  with can sell approximately 5,708.59 MW of \npower to the grid (EPPO 2011).  \n\n\u2022  Reform of the power sector in Thailand is seen in terms of private sector participation and \n\nresources for power generation. \n\nKey successful factors: \n\no  Financial incentive, especially adder \n\nIn the past, incentives for SPPs and VSPPs were not sufficient to attract investors, which \nresulted  in  limited  applications  for  SPP  and  VSPP  projects  (especially  VSPP).  For  the \ncurrent SPP and VSPP program, lucrative and long-term financial incentives are provided \nand  have  been  the  key  factor  in  overcoming  the  financial  constraint  on  investing  in \nrenewable  energy  projects.  Adder  is  the  incentive  that  most  catches  investor  attention, \nespecially for VSPP investors. Furthermore, other financial incentives, including the Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism,  also  contribute  to  financial  feasibility,  resulting  in  the  rapid \nestablishment of numerous SPP and VSPP projects.  \n\no  SPP and VSPP reclassification \n\nBefore  the  current  SPP  and  VSPP  program  came  into  force,  the  allowance  for  selling \npower  from  SPP  and  VSPP  projects  could  not  exceed  90  MW  for  SPPs  and  1  MW  for \nVSPPs. Consequently, there were few VSPP projects as the allowance was too small to \ngain any financial return. The new  policy has increased the  VSPP  limit to up to 10 MW, \nresulting in the emergence of more VSPP projects. \n\no  Technical assistance and other assistance to reduce technological risks \n\nSPP and VSPP projects are directly associated with small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs);  most  of  the  entrepreneurs  participating  in  SPP  and  VSPP  projects  are  from \nSMEs. SMEs lack technical knowledge and experience, especially in the energy business, \nand this causes technological difficulties for investors. Providing technical assistance and \nadvice,  and  other  assistance,  throughout  project  implementation  can  help  enhance \ninvestor confidence, resulting in reduced technological risks.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.1.2  Technologies and Technology Transfer \n\nThrough  several  government  organizations  and  research  institutes,  Thailand  has  invested  in \nresearch  and  development  activities  pertaining  to  greenhouse  gas  mitigation,  especially \nresearch  and  development  for  second-  and  third-generation  renewable  energy  and  new \n\n49 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \ntechnologies  for  energy  efficiency.  However,  technological  research  and  development  has  not \nyet led to such technologies being used on a commercial scale; further development is required. \nFurthermore,  it  is  essential  to  commercialize  such  technologies  so  that  they  can  be  used  for \nmitigating greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nin  Thailand  are  conducive  to  the \n\nCurrent  policies \ntransfer  of  environmentally  sound \ntechnologies,  and  a  number  of  barriers  have  been  eliminated  by  reducing  import  duties, \nreducing  corporate  taxes,  and  providing  subsidies.  Additionally,  the  implementation  of  CDM \ntransfer  and  has  brought  advanced \ntechnology \nprojects  has  a  significant \nenvironmentally sound technologies to the country. The higher level of technology transfer may \nresult from approval criteria of CDM projects, tariffs on imported equipment (lower or exempt), \nand other factors (Seres 2008). \n\nlevel  of \n\n3.1.2  Market-Based Instruments for Pollution Control and Environmental \n\nImprovement \n\n3.1.2.1  Economic Instruments \n\nAlthough  there  has  been  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations  (command  and  control \napproach)  in  Thailand  since  the  early  1990s,  there  has  still  been  environmental  degradation, \nespecially water quality (PCD 2009). The \"polluter pays\" principle is seen as a way to effectively \nsolve  environmental  problems.  The  government  has  developed  the  Act  on  Economic \nInstruments \nfor  solving \nenvironmental pollution problems and improving environmental quality; however, as of October \n2011 the act had not been introduced. \n\nfor  Environmental  Management  as  an  economic \n\ninstrument \n\nBased on the current structure of economic instruments in Thailand, the draft Act on Economic \nInstruments for Environmental Management will serve as an overall framework for all economic \ninstruments  used  for  environmental  protection  and  improvement.  Under  the  act  (based  on  the \nmost  current  draft),  there  are  five  proposed  decrees  covering  five  areas  of  environmental \nmanagement\u2014water  pollution,  air  pollution,  electronic  wastes  and  used  products,  CO 2\n \nemissions from vehicles, and tourism. The proposed economic instruments for these five areas \nare  pollution  taxes,  service  charges,  product  taxes  and  fees,  performance  bonds,  tradable \npermits,  and  environmental  subsidies.  Currently,  the  draft  act  and  decrees  are  under \nconsideration for approval of the Cabinet and the Council of State (some decrees are approved \nby the Cabinet and under review of the Council of State). \n\nIt  can  be  expected  that,  if  economic  instruments  (under  the  decrees)  are  successfully \nintroduced,  there  will  be  significant  environmental  management  and  remediation  impacts, \nincluding  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  act  also  aims  to  introduce  the  allocation  of \ngreenhouse gas caps. Additionally, the revenues collected from pollution taxes will be used to \nimprove  environmental  management  and  pollution  treatment,  which  will  contribute  to  the \nmitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n3.1.2.2  Carbon Trading Scheme \n\nIn addition to the upcoming economic instruments for environmental protection and remediation, \nother market-based instruments are under consideration in Thailand. The Thailand Greenhouse \nGas  Management  Organization  (TGO)  has  an  initiative  to  establish  the  Thailand  Voluntary \nEmission  Trading  Scheme  (TVETS)  and  Thailand  Voluntary  Emission  Reduction  (T-VER) \nscheme  in  order  to  intensify  voluntary  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  efforts  as  a  non-\nAnnex I party.  The establishment of these schemes is still at an early stage. \n\n50 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nIf  the  TVETS  and  T-VER  schemes  are  established  and  functioning,  it  should  be  possible  to \nobtain  systematic  and  comprehensive  data  on  voluntary  greenhouse gas  emissions  reduction, \nand  witness  significant  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  in  several  sectors  in  the  country \nthrough  renewable  energy  utilization;  energy  saving  and  efficiency;;  and  afforestation, \nreforestation, and/or forest conservation activities.  \n\n3.2  Positioning National Actions within the Current Global Climate \n\nRegime and Regional Cooperation Framework \n\nSufficiency Economy Philosophy \n\nThe  Sufficiency  Economy  Philosophy  was  bestowed  on  Thai  people  by  His  Majesty  King \nBhumibol  Adulyadej.  In  1999,  the  formal  interpretation  of  the  Sufficiency  Economy  Philosophy \nwas  made  by  the  Sufficiency  Economy  Working  Group  and  was  approved  by  the  king.  In \naccordance with the formal definition, Sufficiency Economy has four key elements: \n\nSufficiency Economy is an approach to life and conduct which is  applicable at every level \nfrom the individual through the family and community to the management and development \nof the nation. \n\nIt stresses a middle path, especially in developing the economy to keep up with the world in \nthe era of globalization. \n\nSufficiency  has  three  components:  moderation,  reasonableness,  and  the  need  for  built-in \nresilience against the risks which arise from internal or external change.  \n\nIn  addition,  the  application  of theories  in  planning  and  implementation  requires great  care \nand good judgment at every step. At the same time, all members of the nation \u2013 especially \npublic officials, academics, and business people \u2013 need to develop their commitment to the \nimportance  of  knowledge,  integrity,  and  honesty,  and  to  conduct  their  lives  with \nperseverance,  tolerance,  wisdom,  and  insight,  so  that  the  country  has  the  strength  and \nbalance  to  respond  to  the  rapid  and  widespread  changes  in  economy,  society, \nenvironment, and culture in the world. (Wibulswasdi, Piboolsavut, and Pootrakool 2010: 1) \n\nSince  the  8th  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan  (1997\u20132002),  the  Sufficiency \nEconomy  Philosophy  has  been  adopted  as  a  guiding  principle  for  national  development.  The \nkey elements of the philosophy have also been integrated into the 11th National Economic and \nSocial Development Plan (2012\u20132016). \n\nFrom the national position and policy regarding the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, it can be \nseen  that  Thailand  is  pursuing  a  balanced  development  path,  taking  economic,  societal, \nenvironmental, and cultural factors at the local, national, regional, and global levels into account. \nThis  can  be  clearly  interpreted  as  an  indication  that  Thailand  is  seriously  considering  global \nenvironmental changes as a key factor in determining national development. Thus, the national \nposition of Thailand is in line with the current global climate regime and regional cooperation on \nclimate change. \n\nSuch  a  position  ensures  that  multiple  and  co-benefit  policies  and  actions  for  mitigating \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  will  be  considered  for  implementation.  Additionally,  no-regret  and \nleast-cost  policies  and  actions  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction,  which  do  not  have \nsignificant negative impacts on the economy and society, can be expected. \n\n51 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n3.3  Trade and Investment Links with Other Asian Economies \n\nThailand promotes international trade and investment for environmental goods and services. In \nterms  of  trade  and  investment  in  environmental  goods,  the  Board  of  Investment  and  other \ngovernment agencies provide extensive incentive packages to promote investment in renewable \nenergy  and  energy  efficiency  and  environmentally  friendly  trade  of  goods  and  services.  For \ninvestment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, there are both nontax and tax incentives, \nsuch as corporate income tax exemption, and import tax exemption for technologies. \n\nFor  trade  and  investment  in  environmental  services,  Thailand  made  commitments  under  the \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) on environmental services. The current status \nof environmental service is seen as \"no restriction\" (liberalized) for market access and national \ntreatment  under  cross-border  supply  and  consumption  abroad,  and  as  \"partial  restriction\" \n(partially  liberalized)  for  market  access  and  national  treatment  under  commercial  presence 8\n \n(Yoko and Okuda 2000). \n\n3.4  Major Constraints on Regional Cooperation, and Solutions \n\n3.4.1  Global Regimes  \n\nThailand  is  in  the  process  of  drafting  nationally  appropriate  mitigation  actions  (NAMAs)  and  a \nmeasurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system. Significant progress has been made in \ndeveloping  NAMAs  because  some  assistance  has  been  received.  Japan,  via  the  Institute  for \nGlobal  Environment  Research  and  Pacific  Consultant, \nin  cooperation  with  Thailand's \nGreenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) conducted a feasibility study of NAMAs for \nwaste  management  (Ministry  of  the  Environment  of  Japan  and  Global  Environment  Centre \nFoundation  2011).  The  development  of  NAMAs  is  nearing  completion,  and  it  is  likely  that  the \nfirst  of  them  will  soon  be  submitted  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate \nChange). Drafting of the domestic MRV system is also being undertaken by the TGO and other \nrelated agencies, and significant progress has been made. \n\nFor  reducing  emissions  from  deforestation  and  degradation,  and  the  role  of  conservation, \nsustainable  management  of  forest,  and  enhancement  of  forest  carbon  stocks  in  developing \ncountries (REDD+), Thailand  supports  REDD+  because  it  is  in  line  with  the  national  policy  for \nprotecting and conserving forests and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Srethasirote, 2011). \nFurther progress and Thailand's position on REDD+ is still being discussed and developed.  \n\n3.4.2  Trade and Investment in Green and Low-Carbon Products and Services \n\nWith  the  introduction  of  several  incentives  and  regulations,  Thailand  has  facilitated  trade  and \ninvestment in green and low-carbon products and services.  \n\nHowever,  there  are  some  concerns  regarding  the  promotion  of  trade  and  investment  because \nutilization in the domestic market is still limited. The use of green and low-carbon products and \nservices  is  associated  with  financial  costs  and  benefits,  and  applicability  of  the  products  and \nservices  to  the  local  context.  The  cheaper  the  products  and  services,  the  more  they  will  be \nutilized. Thus, financial incentives from the government and other agencies to promote the use \nof  green  and  low-carbon  products  are  essential.  Financial  incentives  should  be  enough  to \novercome the financial barriers and to provide reasonable benefits. Furthermore, it is important \nto  consider  the  local  contexts  for  adopting  green  and  low-carbon  products  and  services. \n                                                \n8 Commercial presence refers to service suppliers that establish, operate, or expand a commercial presence\u2014such \n\nas an agency, branch, subsidiary, or joint venture\u2014in another country. \n\n52 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nAcceptance of such products and services by people in the countries and local communities has \nto be gained before applying products and services. Thus, it is necessary to utilize acceptable \nproducts and services and/or create understanding with the local people. \n\n3.4.3  Institutional and Governance System \n\nIn  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nation  (ASEAN)  countries, the  institutional  and  governance \nchallenge  relates  to  the  extent  of  cooperation  and  integration  on  climate  change  and  green \neconomy among member countries; thus far it is not greatly in evidence\u2014the impact of climate \nchange  is  clearly  not  a  priority  issue.  As  a  result,  international  cooperation  and  assistance  is \nrarely  provided  to  the  region.  Furthermore,  standard  baseline  data  at  the  regional  level \nconcerning climate change and greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts and calculations are \nscattered. \n\n3.4.4  Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperation \n\nThe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  comprises  six  member  countries\u2014five  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries (Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n[Lao PDR], Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and the People\u2019s Republic of China. One of the \nkey  areas  of  GMS  cooperation  is  energy.  The  cooperation  and  initiatives  in  the  energy  sector \nunder  the  GMS  are  emphasized  in  cross-border  electrical  power  trading  and  transmission \nnetworks (Zhai 2010). \n\nUnder  the  GMS,  Thailand  has  bilateral  cooperation  on  power  trade  and  development  with \nCambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR.  Thailand  exports  115  kilovolts  of  electrical  power  to  Cambodia \n(Zhai 2010).  \n\n3.4.4.1  Cooperation between Thailand and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic on Power \n\nDevelopment and Purchasing \n\nAs Thailand has to rely on imported energy and power, it has cooperated with the Lao PDR as \nthere  is  great  potential  to  purchase  power,  especially  hydropower,  from  the  Lao  PDR.  As  of \n2010, Thailand had power purchase agreements with the Lao PDR on six projects, five of which \nwere hydropower projects (2,082.6 MW) (Royal Thai Embassy Vientiane 2011) and the other a \nlignite  project  (1,473  MW)  (EGAT  2011).  Thailand  has  also  signed  a  tariff  memorandum  of \nunderstanding for purchasing power from other projects in the Lao PDR. It should be noted that \nthe  development  of  hydropower  plants  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  assisted  by  the  Asia  Development \nBank (ADB).  \n\nThe use of renewable resources in the Lao PDR to generate electricity to sell to Thailand can be \nconceptualized  as  a  regional  energy  hub.  The  purchase  of  power  from  the  Lao  PDR  not  only \nenhances energy security for Thailand (in terms of adequate energy supply and affordability) but \nalso contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of the energy and power sector. \nThe  reduction  of  greenhouse  gases  originates  from  the  nature  of  the  power  project  itself, \nbecause most power projects developed in the Lao PDR use hydropower. There are also other \nadvantages for the Lao PDR, such as generating income, poverty reduction, improving quality of \nlife,  and  creating  energy  security.  However,  local  environmental  impacts  from  the  project \nconstruction  remain  a  concern  for  local  people  and  nongovernment  organizations  because \nenvironmental impact assessment was not comprehensive. \n\n3.4.4.2  The Future of Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperation in the Energy sector \n\nWith technical assistance from ADB, the formulation of a regional strategy for the energy sector \nin the GMS is solidified. Recently, cooperation in the energy sector was expanded by integrating \n\n53 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nenvironmental and social aspects into the planning and implementation of energy cooperation. \nUnder a plan to implement the GMS Energy Strategy, energy security, renewable energy, and \nenvironmentally  sound  energy  practices  are  included  for  cooperation  (Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  Economic  Cooperation  Program  2009).  Deeper  cooperation  with  the  integration  of \nenvironmental concerns, especially climate change, is expected to create green and low-carbon \ndevelopment  for  the  region  and  for  member  countries,  resulting  in  economic  growth,  energy \nsecurity, and reduced environmental impacts.  \n\nA  MARKAL-based  integrated  energy  system  model  study  conducted  by  Watcharejyothin  and \nShrestha found that unrestricted energy resource development and trade within the GMS would \nprovide  economic  and  environmental  benefits  for  member  countries  (except  for  Myanmar). \nFurthermore, unrestricted energy resource development with reduced CO 2\n emissions of 5% for \neach  member  country  would  enhance  energy  security,  reduce  energy  imports,  lessen  the \ndependency  on  fossil  fuels,  and  increase  the  trading  volume  of  power  within  the  region \n(Watcharejyothin and Shrestha 2009). \n\n3.5  Major Policy Reforms in Thailand \n\nIn Thailand, progress on renewable energy and energy efficiency can be observed through the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  plans.  The  15-\nYear Renewable Energy Development Plan (REDP) and Energy Efficiency Improvement (under \nthe ENCON Program) are the key initiatives. These two plans consist of a number of measures, \nincluding reform measures to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in Thailand. \n\n3.5.1  The 15-Year Renewable Energy Development Plan \n\nThe 15-Year Renewable Energy Development Plan (REDP) consists of several policies creating \nincentives for renewable energy production and utilization:  \n\uf06c  Tax  incentives  from  the  Board  of  Investment: Tax exemptions cover import machinery \nduties  and  corporate  tax  for  new  investment  (8  year  income  tax  holiday  and  a  further  5 \nyears with 50% reduced taxation). \n\n\uf06c  Revolving  Fund:  The  Revolving  Fund  provides  fixed  low-interest  loans  at  less  than  4% \nwith  a  maximum  lending  amount  of  B50  million  and  a  loan  period  of  7  years.  Eligible \ninvestment  costs  are  equipment  and  installation,  consultation,  civil  works,  piping,  or \nnecessary components for the project, as well as other associated costs, such as removal \nof existing equipment, transportation, and taxes. \n\n\uf06c  ESCO  Fund:  This  is  a  government  co-investment  scheme  for  encouraging  private \ninvestment in renewable energy projects. The fund provides financial investment and other \nbenefits  including  equipment  leasing,  carbon  credit  trading,  technical  assistance,  and  a \ncredit  guarantee  facility.  The  investment  term  is  3\u20137  years  with  a  mutually  agreed  exit \nclause. \n\n\uf06c \n\nInvestment  grant:  Grants  are  given  to  develop  small  renewable  energy  projects  (biogas, \nmunicipality  waste,  solar  hot  water).  The  grant  is  provided  for  design,  consultants,  and \npartial investment, with a maximum amount of B50 million. \n\n\uf06c  Adder  cost:  Adder  is  provided  over  the  normal  tariff  rate  for  SPPs  and  VSPPs  using \nrenewable energy, with the duration of 7\u201310 years from the commercial operation date. \n\uf06c  Other  assistance:  Technical  assistance  (such  as  energy  maps),  technology  catalogues, \n\nand favorable regulations applicable for CDM projects are arranged. \n\n54 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n3.5.2  Energy Efficiency Improvement \nThe  Government  of  Thailand  adopted  five  reform  measures  to  promote  energy  conservation \nand  energy  efficiency:  ENCON  Fund,  ESCO  Fund,  tax  incentives,  direct  subsidy,  and  DSM \nbiding. \n  \n\uf075  Revolving Fund: (For details see point 3.5.1.)  \n\uf075  ESCO Fund: (For details see point 3.5.1.)  \n\uf075  Tax incentives: There are few incentive schemes to promote the use of and investment in \n\nenergy efficiency projects.  \n\uf0d8  Tax  incentive  for  energy  efficiency  products  provides  25%  tax  credit  from  purchasing \n19  energy  efficiency  products  (mostly  certified  with  Energy  Label  No.5). This  program \nwill be continued until December 2012.  \n\n\uf0d8  Others:  \n\n\uf0b2  Board of Investment tax incentive: Exemptions of corporate income tax and import \nduties with the maximum of 8 years for energy efficiency equipment manufacturers \nand ESCOs and 50% tax reduction in years 9\u201313.  \n\n\uf0b2  Performance-based tax incentive: Energy saving value can be claimed for income \n\ntax reduction (maximum tax privilege that can be claimed is B2 million). \n\uf075  Subsidy: A subsidy is provided for energy efficiency investments. The subsidy is applicable \nfor  standard  technologies  (approved  technologies),  high  technologies  (demonstrated \nenergy efficiency technologies), and individual projects (other measures and technologies). \nThe program provides a 20% direct subsidiary (of B50,000\u2013B3 million) to facilities that have \npayback periods of not more than 7 years. \n\n\uf075  DSM  biding:  The  program  provides  financial  support  for  investment  in  higher  energy \nefficiency machines and equipment. Proposals that have lower weighted subsidy will be the \nfirst  to  be  subsidized.  Subsidy  is  granted  based  on  actual  energy  saving  (the  subsidy \namount  =  annual  energy  saving  x  the  subsidy  rate).  The  subsidy  rate  for  electricity  is \nB1/kWh, for heat from liquid and gas fuels it is B75 per million British thermal units (BTUs), \nand for heat from solid fuels it is B15/million BTUs. \n\n3.5.3  Key Lessons  \n\nThe  success  of  the  Revolving  Fund,  ESCO  Fund,  and  adder  costs  (limited  to  some  types  of \nrenewable energy) has been noticeable. At the end of 2008, the Revolving Fund supported over \n240  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects  ($500  million  of  total  investment), \ngenerating  energy  savings  of  around  $120 million  per  year  (Asawutmangkul  2010);  the  ESCO \nFund  approved  17  projects  ($125  million  of  total  investment)  generating  energy  savings  of \naround  $14  million  per  year  (Asawutmangkul  2010);  and  adder  costs  for  SPPs  and  VSPPs \ncould generate investment for some sources of renewable energy. \n\nBased  on  these  implementation  results,  it  is  clear  that  the  private  sector  is  ready  to  invest  in \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy projects. However, without some positive conditions\u2014\nsuch  as  adequate  financial  and  technical  support  to  overcome  investment  barriers,  financial \ngains generated from the investment, and favorable conditions and regulations\u2014the investment \nmight not eventuate.

                                                   Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \n3.6  Summary of Recommendations \n\n3.6.1  Policy Reform Challenges for Green and Low-Carbon Development \n\n3.6.1.1  Energy Sector Reform \n\nThailand  has  started  energy  sector  reform.  The  private  sector  can  participate  in  power \ngeneration  activities,  and  renewable  energy  is  used  for  generating  electricity.  However,  the \nlevels  of  private  participation  and  renewable  energy  utilization  can  be  increased  to  improve \nenergy security, maintain economic growth, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions.  \n\nThe key challenge to deeper reform in the energy sector is inducing the private sector to invest \nin renewable energy development. Many incentives are being offered to the private sector, but \nthey  are  not  enough  to  attract  investment  in  solar  and  wind  projects.  Thus,  it  is  important  to \ndevelop  suitable  incentive  options  to  make  investment  in  renewable  energy  attractive  to  the \nprivate sector. \n\n3.6.1.2  Economic Reform \n\nEconomic  reform  is  a  challenging  issue  in  Thailand.  In  general,  environmental  costs  are  not \ngenerally  integrated  into  products  and  services  because  of  the  lack  of  environmental  taxes. \nEnvironmental and carbon taxes are not yet effective (the [Draft] Act on Economic Instruments \nfor  Environmental  Management  is  awaiting  implementation),  and  the  economic  reform  needed \nto integrate environmental costs into economic and pricing systems has yet to occur.  \n\nHowever, when the (Draft) Act on Economic Instruments for Environmental Management comes \ninto effect, reform in the Thai economy should be clearly seen. However, this reform is expected \nto  bring  challenges  in terms  of  associated  costs,  as  the taxes  will  eventually  affect  the  cost of \nproducts  and  services.  With  the  increasing  costs  come  key  challenges  for  the  domestic  and \ninternational  market.  In  the  domestic  market,  the  higher  costs  of  products  and  services  will \naffect low-income earners; the government must address this issue. In the international market, \nincreasing  costs  will  affect  the  ability  to  compete  with  other  exporting  countries.  This  issue  is \ncrucial  because  Thailand  is  a  production  hub  for  many  products,  such  as  electronics  and \nappliances, agricultural and food products, and textiles. The government and industry will need \nto find solutions on international markets. \n\n3.6.1.3 \n\nInstitutional Reform and Governance \n\nIn recent years Thailand has undertaken institutional and governance reform by decentralizing \npower from the central government to local governments, and having more public participation \nin  many  areas,  including  health  and  environmental  impacts.  However,  institutional  and \ngovernance  concerning  green  and  low-carbon  development  for  Thailand  persists  remains \nproblematic in terms of capacity of local governments.  \n\nMost  environmental  responsibilities  of \nlocal \ngovernments, which manage local environmental issues. However, most local governments lack \nthe  capacity  and  resources  to  manage  certain  environmental  issues.  Thus,  the  challenge  for \nThailand is to increase the capacity of, and supply sufficient resources to, local governments so \nthat they can implement and achieve green and low-carbon development in their areas. \n\nthe  central  government  are  assigned \n\nto \n\n3.6.1.4  Regional Cooperation  \n\nIn ASEAN, cooperation among member countries is expected to increase in the years to come \n(through  the  effectiveness  of  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community  [AEC]).  The  AEC  primarily \n\n58 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nfocuses on the economic integration of member countries by eliminating tariffs, addressing the \nmovement  of  professionals  and  capital,  and  facilitating  customs  clearance  procedures. \nHowever, environmental concerns are not yet part of AEC cooperation. Thus, the challenge for \nregional  cooperation  around  green  and \nto  bring  environmental \nconsideration into the AEC system, which may not be possible in the initial stages of the AEC. \n\nlow-carbon \n\nissues \n\nis \n\n3.6.2  Recommendations \n\nClimate change has been recognized as a threat to the nation and has been integrated into the \nformulation of several national plans and policies. Both the public and private sectors have been \nactively involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and a series of measures and actions \nhave been implemented in each sector to achieve this. \n\nDeveloping  renewable  energy  and  promoting  energy  conservation  and  efficiency  are  the \nprimary  ways  to  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Green  consumption  and  production,  as \nwell as green lifestyle, have also been addressed but are yet to mature. The other area that has \nnot  clearly  emerged  yet  is  stakeholder  involvement  and  engagement  for  tackling  climate \nchange.  Even  though  Thailand  has  made  significant  progress  toward  green  and  low-carbon \ndevelopment, more needs to be done. Overall, Thailand has to focus on implementing no-regret \npolicies to ensure the decoupling of the economy and the environment, while starting to looking \nfurther at implementing least-cost policies. Short-term policies should immediately address the \nissue  of  rapidly  increasing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  long-term  policies  should  address \nfundamental changes towards a green and low-carbon society. \n\nIn  the  short  term,  Thailand  needs  to  increase  the  implementation  of  its  current  promising \npolicies  on  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  and  other  green  policies,  such  as  SPPs  and \nVSPPs, Revolving Fund, and ESCO Fund. Additionally, incentives policies should be introduced \nusing  economic  instruments  through  the  market  system.  Policies  regarding  greenhouse  gas \nemission  reduction  should  allow  the  participation  of  the  private  sector,  because  the  private \nsector  has  the  abilities  and  is  efficient  in  making  environmental  advancements.  At  the  same \ntime, the bodies of knowledge concerning new issues, such as green building and homes, need \nto be developed.  \n\nIt  is  essential  for  Thailand  to  emphasize  technology  transfer  regarding  green  and  clean \ntechnologies,  and  regional  and  bilateral  cooperation  for  developing  technologies,  so  that  the \ntechnologies can be deployed quickly and at low cost. Nevertheless, R&D into green and clean \ntechnologies, especially commercialized energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, \nshould  be  prioritized  as  it  is  still  low  in  Thailand.  The focus  of  policies  on  technologies  should \nconcentrate not only on R&D but also on generating the demand for such technologies.  \n\nFor  agricultural  activities,  policies  around  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  have  not  yet \ntaken  shape.  The  key  consideration \nis  changing  current  agricultural  practices  to  be \nenvironmentally  friendly  by  changing  farmer  behavior  and  introducing  new  technologies  and \nmaterials. \n\nNew policy initiatives concerning greenhouse gas emissions reduction, such as green buildings \nand  homes,  and  green  islands  and  cities,  should  be  further  developed,  and  suitable  concepts \nand models should be developed to fit the Thai context. The basic information and knowledge \non climate change should be developed and utilized to advance new policy initiatives.  \n\nFor  long-term  policies,  the  foundation  of  the  society  needs  to  be  addressed,  especially  in  the \npublic  sector.  Fundamental  changes  are  needed  in  terms  of  environmental  awareness  and \nbehavior, and these issues should be addressed by integrating both environmental knowledge \nand awareness into the educational system and facilitating environmentally friendly behavior. \n\n59 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 352                                                                  Chotichanathawewong and Thongplew \n \n \nIt is important to find innovative solutions to overcome the challenges being faced in each sector \n(Table 3.3). \n\nTable 3.3: Sector Challenges and Solutions \n\nSector \n\nChallenge \n\nSolution \n\nEnergy and power \nsector \n\nAchieving 15-Year Renewable \nEnergy Plan \n\nRevise renewable energy incentives \n\nRemove other barriers to renewable energy \nutilization for each specific source of energy \n\nImprove renewable resource management and \nutilization \n\nAddress the issue of nuclear power and clean \ncoal with public participation for arriving at \nmutual agreement for the direction of national \npower development \n\nFinalizing the direction of power \ndevelopment through the Power \nDevelopment Plan  \n\nDeveloping new technologies for \nrenewable energy \n\nResearch and develop into new renewable \ntechnologies (also considering the food versus \nenergy issue) \n\nIndustry sector \n\nIntensifying the utilization of \nrenewable energy  \n\nCooperation among developing countries for \ncommercial R&D on technologies to reduce cost \nand to develop new generation of technologies \nConsider the utilization of on-site renewable \nenergy generation technologies \n\nImplementation of greenhouse gas \nemissions reduction is still limited to \nlarge and medium-sized enterprises \n\nIntegrate environment rationalities into the \nindustry and manufacturing sectors, especially \nfor small enterprises \n\nEncourage large companies to implement \ngreening the supply chain with their small \nsuppliers \n\nHigh cost of technologies \n\nSupport the local production of energy efficiency \nand renewable energy technologies  \n\nFurther development of renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency in the \nindustry sector \n\nConsider the tax system and implement new \npositive economic instruments, such as  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\ncarbon taxes (reducing taxes) for \nproducts or activities utilizing \nrenewable energy \nfinancial incentives for enterprises that \ninvest in renewable energy or reduce \nenergy consumption;

Even  though  Thailand  is  not  obligated  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  it \nvoluntarily  takes  numerous  actions  to  mitigate  emissions.  Both  the  public  and  private  sector \nhave been actively involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a series of measures \nand actions implemented in each sector. \n", "The development of renewable energy and the promotion of energy conservation and efficiency \nare  the  primary  means  to  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  Thailand.  With  the \nestablishment  of  the  Energy  Conservation  Program  in  1995,  a  viable  movement  for  energy \nconservation  and  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  had  begun.  Over  the  years,  progress  in \nrenewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  has  been  made.  Recently,  the  15-Year  Renewable \nEnergy  Development  Plan  and  the  20-Year  Energy  Conservation  Plan  comprised  several \ninnovative measures and incentive mechanisms to further advance the development of energy \nefficiency and renewable energy. Regardless of government policies and measures, the private \nsector has also taken part in greenhouse gas emissions mitigation by implementing a number of \nactivities  to  reduce  carbon  sources  (e.g.,  improved  production  processes  and  resource \nefficiency) and to create carbon sinks (e.g., reforestation and mangrove plantations). \n", "Thailand has made significant progresses toward green and low-carbon development; however, \nthere is a need to further address the issue. The country has to focus on the implementation of \nno-regret policies to ensure the decoupling of economic growth, while starting to look further at \nimplementing least-cost policies. There should be short-term policies to immediately address a \nrapid  increase  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  long-term  policies  to  address  fundamental \nchanges towards a green and low-carbon society. \n", "JEL Classification: Q54, Q58 \n", " \n"]}
