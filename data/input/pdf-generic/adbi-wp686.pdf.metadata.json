T. H. Ahn \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nThe  main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  identify  leading  indicators  and  a  suitable  early \nwarning system (EWS) model of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. The EWS for currency \ncrisis was built to aim at identifying abnormal fluctuations and recession in the foreign \nexchange  market  in  advance  to  allow  governments  to  adopt  preemptive  policy \nmeasures  (Kaminsky  et  al.  1998).  However,  forecasting  the  exact  time  of  a  currency \ncrisis is likely complicated not only for policy makers but also for researchers.  \n\nAlmost all studies on the EWS for a currency crisis employ either parametric approach \n(i.e.,  regression-based)  or  non-parametric  approach  (or  signal  approach)  (Comelli \n2013).  The  signal  approach  for  a  currency  crisis  was  developed  by  Kaminsky  and \nReinhart  (1996),  Frankel  and  Rose  (1996),  Kaminsky  et  al.  (1998),  Kaminsky  and \nReinhart (1999), Berg and Pattillo (1999), and Zhuang (2005). For a signal approach, \nvulnerability indicators were transformed into a weighted average of binary signals. The \nauthors  evaluated  the  validity  of  both  macroeconomic  and  financial  indicators  in \npredicting  a  currency  crisis  in  advance  in  which  they  compared  the  behavior  of  these \nvariables in periods preceding crises. Deviations of these variables from their \u201cnormal\u201d \nlevels beyond a certain threshold value could issue warning signals of a currency crisis \nwithin  a  specified  period  of  time  (Kaminsky  et  al.  1998).  According  to  the  paper, \n105 indicators were listed and classified into six groups, including the external sector, \nthe  financial  sector,  the  real  sector,  the  public  finances,  institutional  and  structural \nvariables, and political variables. However, among them, export, money supply growth, \ndeficits in current accounts, real overvaluation, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, \nfiscal  deficits,  international  reserves  to  short-term  debt  ratio,  as  well  as  financial \nstability, were found to issue signals for a currency crisis within the next 24 months. \n\nUnlike  a  signal  approach,  the  parametric  EWS  is  regression-based,  typically  logit  or \nprobit, where the crisis variable is regressed on a set of macroeconomic and financial \nindicators. It, therefore, could estimate probability of forecasting a true crisis. Based on \na  multivariate  probit-based  methodology,  Berg  and  Pattillo  (1999)  found  that  this \napproach  outperformed  non-parametric  in  terms  of  scores  and  goodness-of-fit  in \nforecasting  the  1997  crisis.  Bussiere  and  Fratzscher  (2006)  applied  a  multinomial  \nlogit  regression-based  EWS  and  argued  that  the  model  is  outperformed  binomial  one  \nin  predicting  episodes  of  a  currency  crisis  in  32  emerging  markets  for  the  period  \n1993\u20132001. Moreover, the paper shed light on defining a currency crisis by employing \nexchange  market  pressure  (EMP)  in  the  parametric  model.  Similar  to  Bussiere  and \nFratzscher  (2006),  Aizenman  and  Hutchison  (2012)  focused  on  the  extent  that  the \nglobal  financial  crisis  caused  external  market  pressure  and  found  that  emerging \ncountries with higher total foreign liabilities had greater exposure and were much more \nvulnerable to the financial crisis.  \n\nEWS  for  a  banking  and  currency  crisis  has  also  been  studied  by  Vietnamese \nresearchers  such  as  Nguyen  Thi  Kim  Thanh  et  al.  (2008),  Nguyen  Ngoc  Duy  and \nHuynh Ngoc Huy (2009), Nguyen Xuan Trinh et al. (2010), and Ho Thanh Son (2012). \nMost  of  them  employed  the  non-parametric  methodology  to  identify  indicators  for  a \ncurrency crisis. Nguyen Thi Kim Thanh et al. (2008) found that 39 macroeconomic and \nfinancial  indicators,  such  as  international  reserves,  short-term  debt  to  international \nreserves  ratio,  and  foreign  currency  liabilities  to  foreign  currency  assets  in  banking \nsystem, could issue signals of  a crisis. On the other hand, an EWS study by  Nguyen \nXuan Trinh et al. (2010) found that current account to GDP ratio outperformed others in \npredicting a currency crisis in Viet Nam.  \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\nThis paper contributes to the EWS existing literature in novel ways as follows. First, this \nis  the  first  time  global  shock  is  considered  as  one  of  leading  indicators  in  the  EWS \nmodel for a currency crisis. The model found that this variable impacts negatively and \nsignificantly  on  probability  of  a  crisis.  Second,  while  most  studies  on  EWS  of  a  crisis  \nin  Viet  Nam  employed  non-parametric  models  (Nguyen  Thi  Kim  Thanh  et  al.  2008, \nNguyen  Ngoc  Duy  and  Huynh  Ngoc  Huy  2009,  Ho  Thanh  Son  2012),  the  author \nemployed  a  combination  of  parametric  and  non-parametric  approaches  for  identifying \nindicators and probability of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. Explanatory variables in this \nmodel could be in the absolute form (model 1) or be coded as \u201c1\u201d if its value exceeds \nthe  threshold  and  \u201c0\u201d  otherwise  (model  2).  Third,  to  overcome  limitations  of  model  2, \nthis  paper  employs  model  3  in  which  codes  are  written  in  Eviews  program  that  could \navoid  manual  converting  explanatory  variables  into  dummy  ones.  In  this  program,  we \nset  the  maximum  number  of  errors  of  1000  and  grid  search  of  three.  Fourth,  unlike \nrecent  studies  on  EWS  in  Viet  Nam,  this  paper  uses  real  overvaluation  as  an \nexplanatory  variable  of  a  currency  crisis  model  instead  of  nominal  exchange  rates. \nLastly, this research extends study period from 1996 to February 2016 so that it covers \nall recent crises (Asian financial crisis, the global financial crisis, European debt crisis, \nand  unexpected  shocks  in  monetary  policies  of  large  economies  such  as  the  United \nStates  [US]  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  [PRC])  that  could  cause  negative \nimpacts on Viet Nam\u2019s economy in general, and on the financial market in particular. \n\nThe  main  findings  of  this  paper  are  as  follows.  First,  this  paper  found  that  global \nfinancial  shocks  (e.g.,  regional  and  global  financial  crisis,  unexpected  changes  in \nmonetary  policy  of  largest  economies  such  as  the  US  and  the  PRC),  and  domestic \ncredit growth rate are leading indicators of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. Others, such \nas  deficits  in  trade  balance,  international  reserves  in  import\u2019s  weeks  and  overvalue  \nof  dong,  should  be  good  signals  of  a  currency  crisis.  Second,  among  three  main \nmodels (including of six sub-models) with different window lengths,  model 1 (in which \ndependent  variable,  currency  crisis  (CC),  is  defined  based  on  the  EMP  and  parallel \nmarket premium, and all explanatory variables are expressed in absolute values with a \nwindow  length  of  2  months)  outperformed  in  predicting  a  currency  crisis-hit  period  in \nViet  Nam.  Empirical  results  of  model  1  suggested  that  the  probability  of  predicting  a \ntrue  currency  crisis  was  77.5%;  probability  of  predicting  a  crisis-hit  period  with  signal \nwas 64.6%.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 will give an overview of \nexchange  rate  policy  developments  in  Viet  Nam.  Section  3  will  give  a  definition  of  a \ncurrency  crisis  in  Viet  Nam  based  on  the  EMP  index  and  other  events  in  which  the \ncentral bank, the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), launched their policy measure related \nto exchange rate. Section 4 employs parametric and non-parametric models to identify \nleading indicators and probability of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. In addition, Model 3 \nis also applied to check robustness of findings. The results obtained from models and \ncomments  on  these  will  be  presented  in  section  4.  Section  5  presents  the  summary \nand conclusion.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\n2.  EXCHANGE RATE POLICY DEVELOPMENTS  \n\nIN VIET NAM \n\nAfter  the  reunification  of  Viet  Nam  on  30  April  1975,  the  socialism  model  applied \nthroughout the country and confidence among Vietnamese was at an all-time high. The \ndong was valued at only a little less than $1.00.1 At that time, it was a centrally planned \neconomy  with  government\u2019s  intervention  in  all  macro-  and  microeconomic  policies.  \nThis  model  used  to  be  very  effective  and  efficient  in  wartime,  but  in  the  long  run,  it \ndistorted  and  severed  a  supply\u2013demand  law  in  the  market  as  well  as  caused  many \nserious economic consequences. Obviously, market realities soon forced a change. On \n14 September  1985,  a  new  dong  note  was  issued  with  denomination  at  10  times  the \nvalue of the old dong. This action led panic through the markets as people rushed to \ndump  dong  in  favor  of  purchasing  commodities  and  staples.  This,  in  turn,  sparked \n4 years of spiralling inflation, which reached an all-time high of 600% in 1989. \n\nWith an unstable macroeconomic background before 1988, Viet Nam applied a regime \nin  which  the  exchange  rate  was  determined  by  comparing  internal  and  external \npurchasing  power  of  currencies  and  then  set  by  multi-parties  agreements  among \ncommunist countries. In other words, the exchange rate was totally determined by the \nGovernment of Viet Nam, ignoring the currency\u2019s supply and demand factors. Another \ncharacteristic  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  exchange  rate  regime  at  that  time  was  a  multi-exchange \nrate  which  consisted  of  official  or  trade  exchange  rate,  non-trade  exchange  rate, \ninternal exchange rate, and parallel market rate. The regime, therefore, caused serious \nconsequences  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy,  including  (i)  the  overvaluation  of  the  dong  in \ncomparison  with  hard  currencies  such  as  US  dollar,  pound  sterling,  French  franc, \nDeutch mark, and yen; (ii) a wider gap between official and black market exchange rate \n(parallel  market  premium)  caused  loss  of  public  confidence  in  dong\u2019s  value;  and \n(iii) Viet  Nam\u2019s  competitiveness  was  harmed,  which  led  to  a  heavy  deficit  in  both  the \ntrade account and the current account.  \n\nAs  part  of  its  economic  renovation  program,  Viet  Nam  reformed  the  financial  and \nbanking sector by establishing a two-tier banking system in 1988 under which the SBV, \nas  the  central  bank,  was  separated  from  the  four  state-owned  commercial  banks \n(Rosegard  and  Huynh  2008,  Tien  N.V.  2012).  Moreover,  the  two-tier  banking  system \ndid not function as expected because the SBV was still a part of the state bureaucracy. \nTo  create  a  favorable  legal  environment  for  the  operations  of  the  central  bank,  the \ngovernment approved the Ordinance on the State Bank of Viet Nam in which the term \n\u201cmonetary policy\u201d was formally used for the first time. Although the SBV at the time was \nstill following the old operating mechanism, the law clarified the objective of monetary \nmanagement as that of stabilizing prices and the exchange rates. \n\nDuring  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  while  most  currencies  in  Asia  (such  as  Thai  baht, \nIndonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit, etc.) suffered from large devaluations against the \nUS  dollar  and  other  hard  currencies,  the  SBV  kept  the  US  dollar/dong  exchange  rate \nstable. This would lead to a large real overvaluation of the dong against the US dollar \nand  harmed  competitiveness  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  goods  and  services.  Therefore,  severe \ndeficits  in  trade  balance  were  observed  during  1996\u20131999.  To  avoid  unexpected \nconsequences  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  Viet  Nam  implemented  a  \u201ccautious\u201d \nexchange rate policy that allowed a gradual devaluation in dong, combined with strict  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Brahm, Laurence J, Nhi, Le Trong, Jul/Aug 1993. pp.194. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\nexchange  controls.  It  was  known  as  an  adjustable  (or  effective)  pegged  exchange  \nrate  regime  that  could  help  the  country  stabilize  real  effective  exchange  rate  (REER) \n(Ohno  1999)  and,  therefore,  improve  trade  balances  to  be  positive  for  the  first  time  \never in 1999.  \n\nTo  overcome  economic  and  financial  problems  caused  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis, \nstabilize exchange rates, and enhance economic reform, the SBV\u2019s Governor approved \nDecision No. 64/1999/QD-NHNN7 and Decision No. 65/1999/QD-NHNN7 on exchange \nmanagement.  Since  25  February  1999,  the  SBV  has  followed  the  practice  of \nannouncing,  on  each  working  day,  an  official  US  dollar  exchange  rate  of  the  dong, \nalong  with  a  trading  band,  on  the  basis  of  the  average  actual  exchange  rates  of \npreceding  days  in  the  interbank  market.  The  trading  rate  at  commercial  banks  is \ndetermined  freely  among  the  licensed  banks,  subject  to  the  requirement  that  buying \nand  selling  rates  remain  within  the  ceilings  and  floors  established  around  the  official \nrate  of  +  0.1%,  then  \u00b10.25%  (effective  on  1  July  2002).  Therefore,  instead  of  fixed \nexchange  rate  regime,  in  early  1999,  Viet  Nam  followed  a  type  of  crawling  peg \nexchange  rate  system,  which  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  classifies  as  a  \n\u201cde facto managed floating regime (managed floating with no pre-announced path for \nexchange  rate).\u201d  While  Viet  Nam  officially  announced  to  follow  a  managed  floating \nexchange rate system,2 the current exchange rate system functions like a category of \nconventional pegged arrangement against a single currency (2005\u20132007).3 In addition, \nsince 2004, the Governor of the SBV has announced the exchange rate targets at the \nbeginning  of  each  year.  It  is  suggested  that  the  SBV  use  the  exchange  rate  as  a \nnominal anchor in implementing its monetary policy.  \n\nHowever,  due  to  negative  impacts  in  2007,  turbulences  were  seen  on  the  foreign \nexchange  market,  such  as  exchange  rate  reached  the  top  of  19,800  in  June  2008 \n(about  16%  higher  than  the  official  rate).  Moreover,  public  confidence  in  dong  value \nwas  harmful,  significantly  leading  to  an  increase  in  deposit  dollarization  index. \nTherefore,  the  SBV  had  to  implement  exchange  rate  policy  measures  to  stabilize  \nboth  official  and  parallel  markets,  such  as  (i)  devaluing  the  official  exchange  rate, \n(ii) widening \nthe  official  exchange  rate, \n(iii) increasing interest rates, and (iv) and administrative measures that are summarized \nin Tables 1 and 2. After the stabilization period of 2012\u20132014, turbulences emerged in \nthe  foreign  exchange  due  to  unexpected  changes  in  monetary  policies  of  large \neconomies such as the PRC and the US in 2015.

MODEL SPECIFICATIONS \n\n3.1  Currency Crisis or Foreign Exchange Market Turbulences \n\nin Viet Nam  \n\nThe EWS of a currency crisis could be valuable for policy makers in the sense that it \ncould  be  used  for  detecting  underlying  economic  weakness  and  vulnerabilities,  and \nallowing  the  adoption  of  preemptive  measures  to  reduce  the  risks  of  experiencing  a \ncrisis  (Bussiere  and  Fratzscher  2006).  Currency  crisis  usually  refers  to  a  situation  in \nwhich the economy is under pressure of a sharp depreciation in local currency value. \nTherefore, in most papers, currency crisis is defined as (i) large devaluations adjusted \nfor interest rate differentials, and (ii) large devaluations which exceed the devaluation in \nthe  previous  period  by  some  multiple  (Kumar  et  al.  2003).  In  this  case,  the  monetary \nauthorities have to defend the domestic currency by selling foreign exchange reserves \nor raising the domestic interest rate (Glick and Hutchison 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\nSince  the  official  foreign  exchange  market  was  established  in  1994,  Viet  Nam  has \nexperienced several \u201ccurrency crises.\u201d However, unlike most countries, the magnitude \nof  Viet  Nam\u2019s  currency  crisis  is  not  large  as  those  of  other  currency  crises  such  as  \nthe  Asian  financial  currency  crisis,  the  Russian  Federation  financial  crisis  (1998  and \n2014), etc. In practice, currency crises in Viet Nam happened and lasted for a shorter \nperiod  such  as  weeks,  1  month,  or  2  months.  Based  on  definition  of  currency  crisis \nsuggested by Kaminsky et al. (1997), Kumar et al. (2003), Goldstein et al. (2000), and \nBussiere  and  Fratzscher  (2006),  the  paper  sheds  light  on  new  approach  of  currency \ncrisis definition in which Viet Nam could suffer from a currency crisis or exchange rate \nturbulences if  \n\n(i)  Exchange  market  pressure  (EMP)  at  time  i  is  above  its  country  average  EMP \n\nand two standard deviations (SD) \n\n(ii)  Parallel market premium is 5% above the targeted trading band set by the SBV; \n\nParallel market premium = \n\n \n\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\u2212\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\n\n\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\n\n\u2217 100\n\nin which: PER is exchange rate at Ha Noi parallel exchange market \n\nOER: average weighted interbank exchange rate  \n\nWe  choose  parallel  market  premium  as  a  measure  of  currency  crisis  because  the \nparallel  market  is  illegal  but  has  emerged  in  response  to  the  tight  control  of  foreign \nexchange  transactions  in  the  official  market.  In  practice,  parallel  rate  is  totally \ndetermined  by  demand  and  supply  conditions,  and  is,  in  principle,  not  subject  to \nregulations by the SBV, while official rate seemed to be constant overtime (set by the \nSBV).  Therefore,  parallel  rate  will  immediately  react  to  any  unexpected  changes  in \ndemand  and  supply  leading  to  a  gap  (parallel  market  premium)  between  parallel  and \nofficial  rate.  If  parallel  market  premium  is  becoming  larger,  the  SBV  should  sell \ninternational  reserves  to  stabilize  FOREX  and  launch  a  comprehensive  package  of \npolicy measures to stabilize the market (see more in Tables 1 and 2). \n\n3.2  Parametric or Non-parametric Model \n\nThe  EWS  of  financial  crisis,  banking  crisis,  and  currency  crisis  could  be  based  on \nparametric  (i.e.,  regression  based)  and  non-parametric  approach  (crisis  signal \nextraction).  By  using  regression  methodology  of  discrete  variables  such  as  logit  and \nprobit,  parametric  approach  to  EWS  of  financial  crises  is  employed  to  estimate  the \nprobability  of  crisis.  Based  on  the  non-parametric  approach,  Kaminsky  et  al.  (1998) \nargue a set of leading indicators that could issue good signal of a currency crisis in the \nnext  24  months.  In  that  study,  the  authors  employed  event  study  to  find  out \ndevelopments of macroeconomic indicators as well as financial variables (i.e., domestic \ncredit  growth  rate,  money  supply  growth  rate,  deficits  in  state  budget  and  current \naccounts,  real  overvaluation,  international  reserves)  before  a  crisis-hit  period.  The \nsimilar model and findings could be found in some studies, such as Frankel and Rose \n(1996),  and  Kaminsky  and  Reinhart  (1999),  where  they  used  annual  data  on  a  set  of \ncountries  to  estimate  causes  of  a  financial  crisis.  However,  it  was  not  suitable  for \npredicting probability of a financial crisis.  \n\nTo  overcome  this  problem,  recent  studies,  such  as  Berg  et  al.  (2005)  with  the \ndeveloping  country  studies  division  (DCSD)  model,  Beckmann  et  al.  (2006),  and \nComelli  (2013),  used  monthly  data  to  calculate  the  probability  of  a  currency  crisis  in \nreal  time.  In  the  non-parametric  EWS,  the  crisis  probability  Pt  is  calculated  as  a \nweighted  average  of  crisis  signals  issued  by  a  set  of  selected  macroeconomic \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\nindicators. To establish when an indicator is issuing a crisis signal, there is a need to \nchoose  a  threshold.  If  an  indicator  exceeds  the  threshold,  it  is  considered  to  issue  a \ncrisis signal.  \n\nNon-parametric  EWS  is  very  simple,  but  its  limitation  is  that  it  assumes  linearity \nrelationship between indicators of a currency crisis. On the other hand, the parametric \napproach  to  EWS  helps  in  identifying  probability  of  a  currency  crisis.  In  terms  \nof  performance,  Beckmann  et  al.  (2006)  and  Comelli  (2013)  suggested  that  \nthe  parametric  EWS  achieves  superior  out-of-sample  results  compared  with  the  \nnon-parametric  EWS.  Moreover,  this  approach  combines  all  variables  simultaneously \nand  disregards  variables  that  do  not  contribute  information  to  the  model  (Kaminsky  \net  al.  1998).  However,  it  still  has  some  limitations  such  as  (i)  not  providing  a \nquantitative  ranking  measure  for  indicators  based  on  their  ability  of  predicting  a \ncurrency  crisis,  and  (ii)  not  providing  a  transparent  reading  of  where  and  how \nwidespread macroeconomic problems are (Kaminsky et al. 1998). \n\nIn this research, I, therefore, will combine both parametric and non-parametric methods \nto identify leading indicators as well as probability of a currency crisis in Viet Nam.

However, as mentioned earlier, the magnitude \nof Viet Nam\u2019s currency crisis is not large: it happened and lasted for a shorter period \nsuch  as  weeks,  1  month,  or  2  months.  Therefore,  instead  of  12  or  24  months,  I  will \nchoose window lengths of 1 month and 2 months for the EWS model of currency crisis \nin Viet Nam.  \n\nTo check the effectiveness of probit model in identifying leading indicators of currency \nturbulences  in  Viet  Nam,  I  use  two  types  of  models.  The  first  model  (Model  1)  is  a \nlinear  probit  in  which  all  explanatory  variables  are  expressed  in  its  absolute  values, \nwhile the second model (Model 2) is also a linear probit, but all explanatory variables \nare coded as \u201c1\u201d if its value is above the threshold, otherwise coded as \u201c0.\u201d Moreover, \neach model is tested for different lengths of window such as 1 month and 2 months. It, \ntherefore, gives a total of four models for checking the robustness of leading indicator \nof a currency crisis in Viet Nam. \n\n4.

However,  we  realized  that  we  may  be \nthrowing  away  some  useful  information  that  can  lead  to  less  precise  estimates  of  the \ncoefficients. In order to verify the adequacy of these values, we have conducted a grid \nsearch over different values of thresholds (Table 12). This program will help to identify \nsuitable  thresholds  for  explanatory  variables  and  make  converting  smoother.  In \naddition, we want to check if thresholds in Model 2 are reasonable or not. \n\nTable 12: Choosing Grid and Grid Width to Identify Thresholds for Variables  \n\n \n\nDC \nOVERVALUE3 \nRES \nTB \n\nGrid \n20, 25, 30, \u2026, 50 \n0.0, 2.5, 5.0, \u2026, 20.0 \n6, 8, 10, 12 \n\u201320, \u201315, \u201310, \u20135 \n\nGrid Width \n5 \n2.5 \n2 \n5 \n\nThreshold in Model 2 \n25 \n5 \n10 \n\u201315 \n\nDC  =  domestic  credit  growth,  RES  =  international  reserves  in  import\u2019s  weeks,  TB  =  deficits  in  trade  balance  per  \nGDP ratio. \n\nTotal number of combinations amounts to 1008. In order to choose the best model for \npredicting a currency crisis, we have sorted the model into three criteria: (i) probability \nof  predicting  a  true  currency  crisis  (criterion-1);  and  (ii)  probability  of  currency  crises \nwith signals (criterion-2); and (iii) Akeike Information Criterion (AIC) (Appendix 1). \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\nIn terms of the probability of predicting a true currency crisis (criterion-1), models with \nthresholds of DC=35 percent, RES=10 weeks, TB=-15 percent, and OVERVALUE=15 \npercent  or  17.5  percent  are  selected  as  the  best,  with  the  probability  77.77%.  The \nvalues of \u201cRES\u201d and \u201cTB\u201d match with the thresholds in Model 2. On the other hand, this \nresult suggests use of slightly higher thresholds for \u201cDC\u201d and \u201cOVERVALUE\u201d. However, \nthe performance of these models worsens in terms of criterion-2.  \n\nIn  terms  of  the  probability  of  currency  crises  with  signals  (criterion-2),  there  are  \nseven  models  which  give  the  same  probability.  Again,  the  models  suggest  a  slightly \nhigher threshold for \u201cDC\u201d. These models also suggest use of a slightly higher threshold \nfor  \u201cTB\u201d.  For  \u201cOVERVALUE\u201d  and  \u201cRES,\u201d  though  the  predictabilities  are  the  same  \nfor  different  combinations,  they  again  suggest  a  slightly  higher  threshold  for \n\u201cOVERVALUE\u201d. Talking about the \u201cRES,\u201d they are consistent with the setting of Model \n2. Again, the performance of these models worsens in terms of criterion-1. Overall, the \nresults confirm that the thresholds used in Model 2 are reasonable for \u201cRES\u201d and \u201cTB\u201d. \nFor \u201cDC\u201d and \u201cOVERVALUE,\u201d though the analysis suggests slightly higher thresholds, \nthe models with suggested thresholds cannot dominate Model 2 in terms of two criteria \nsimultaneously.  Therefore,  we  reconfirm  that  thresholds  of  explanatory  variables  in \nModel 2 are reasonable for predicting a currency crisis in Viet Nam.  \n\n4.3  Comments on Results  \n\nIn  general,  we  observed  different  roles  of  macroeconomic  indicators  in  predicting  a \ncurrency crisis in Viet Nam. Based on empirical results of the specified probit models \nwith different window lengths, some main findings are as follows:  \n\nFirst, external shocks (e.g., regional or global financial crisis and unexpected changes \nin monetary policy) are proved to be the most important indicator of a currency crisis in \nViet Nam which is significant at the 1% level for all tested models. In other words, Viet \nNam\u2019s  financial  market,  especially  foreign  exchange  market,  is  easily  vulnerable  to \nexternal shock in the international financial market. This finding could be explained by a \nhigh openness ratio in Viet Nam\u2019s economy.  \n\nFigure 1: External Shocks and Foreign Exchange Market Turbulences, 2006\u20132015 \n\nSource: www.sbv.gov.vn; www.vangsaigon.com.vn; and www.vcb.com.vn.  \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\nSecond, similar to external shock, our models find that high growth in domestic credit \nwas  also  considered  as  an  empirical  reason  of  a  currency  crisis  in  Viet  Nam  at \nsignificance level of 1% in all four models. This finding is consistent with theory as well \nas  empirical  evidence  suggested  by  Kaminsky  (1998),  Berg  and  Pattillo  (1999),  and \nEdison  (2003).  A  high  growth  rate  of  domestic  credit  would  lead  to  a  decrease  in \nsoundness of commercial banks by increasing non-performing loan ratio, reducing the \nreturn  on  asset  (ROA)  and  return  on  equity  (ROE)  ratios,  etc.;  in  the  worst-case \nscenario, it could lead to a banking crisis. The world economy has witnessed a series \nof  banking  crises  as  well  as  currency  crises  which  resulted  from  a  boom  in  domestic \ncredit that happened not only in developed countries such as the US (the US subprime \nloan crisis in 2007\u20132008), Japan (in the early 1990s), but also in developing countries \n(East  Asian  countries  in  1997).  In  some  cases,  banking  and  currency  crises  have \ntended to cluster and have come to be known as the \u201ctwin crises\u201d (Kaminsky 1998). \n\nBank lending was proved to be the most effective channel in transmission mechanism \nof monetary policy in Viet Nam (Nguyen Thanh Nhan et al. 2013, Pham Thi Hoang Anh \net  al.  2013)  so  that  the  SBV  has  been  employing  domestic  credit  growth  as  an \noperating  target.  High  credit  growth  rate  of  25%  was  seen  as  a  very  important \ndeterminant  of  economic  growth  in  Viet  Nam  (To  Ngoc  Hung  et  al.  2013,  Pham  Thi \nHoang Anh et al. 2013). However, domestic credit growth rate above the threshold of \n25%  will  be  harmful  to  assets\u2019  quality  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  banking  system.  By  relaxing  the \ncondition for lending activities as a part of stimulus package in responses to negative \nimpacts of the global financial crisis, domestic credit to the economy increased sharply \nfrom  25%  in  2007  to  more  than  50%  in  2008  and  2010  (Figure  2).  This  fact  led  Viet \nNam\u2019s banking system to face many difficulties such as high nonperforming loan ratio,6 \nliquidity deficits,7 etc. The banking crisis and macroeconomic difficulties (high inflation \nrate, high unemployment, high deficit in trade balance, and tumble in the stock market) \nresulted  in  chaos  in  gold  and  foreign  exchange  market  during  2010\u20132012.  These \nfindings suggest that the monetary authorities should set the target for domestic credit \nbelow 25%. Additionally, it could be inferred that the authorities also need to create a \nfavorable environment  for developing other channels of capital transfer such as stock \nmarket  and  bond  market,  and  then  reducing  the  economy\u2019s  independence  on  the \nbanking system.  \n\nThird,  overvaluation  is  found  to  be  one  of  leading  indicators  of  currency  crisis  in  Viet \nNam. In other words, the higher the overvaluation, the higher the probability of currency \ncrisis  in  Viet  Nam,  which  is  significant  at  the  1%  level  for  the  first  model  in  which  all \nexplanatory  variables  are  expressed  in  its  absolute  values.  This  finding  is  consistent \nwith  those  of  Kaminsky  et  al.  (1998)  and  Llaudes  et  al.  (2010).  According  to \ninternational  trade  theory,  overvaluation  will  diminish  a  country\u2019s  competitiveness \nleading to an increase in import and a decrease in export. This movement will harm the \ntrade  balance8 status  resulting  in  depreciation  pressure  because  of  excess  demand, \neven unexpected large fluctuations in the foreign exchange market.  \n\n \n\nin 2013. \n\n                                                 \n6   According  to  the  SBV  report,  nonperforming  loan  ratio  is  17.21%  after  the  SBV  revaluates  loans  \n\n7   Because  of  liquidity  shortage  within  Viet  Nam\u2019s  banking  system,  overnight  and  1-month  interbank \ninterest  rate  reached  the  top  of  about  16%  and  more  than  30%  per  year  in  18  October  2011, \nrespectively  (http://kinhdoanh.vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/ebank/ngan-hang/lai-suat-lien-ngan-hang-len-30-ky-\nhan-mot-thang-2715756.html). \n\n8   Because  of  large  overvaluation  of  the  dong  against  the  US  dollar  since  2008,  the  trade  balance  had \n\nbegun to record a large deficit of $14.21 billion in the first 6 months of 2008.  \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP.

In addition, as market participants saw lurking problems for \nthe  prospects  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy,9 the  dong  began  to  depreciate  from  late  May \n2008, reaching a bottom of 16,522 per US dollar on 8 July in the interbank market and \n19,400 per US dollar on 19 June 2008 in the parallel market (Takagi and Pham 2011). \nMorgan Stanley, for example, stated on 7 July 2008: \u201cVietnam will fail to halt declines in \n                                                 \n9   The rate of inflation had reached more than 28% (year-on-year) in August 2008, the highest in 17 years; \nequity  and  real  estate  prices  had  tumbled  from  the  beginning  of  the  year  (the  declines  would  amount  \nto  nearly  70%  and  50%,  respectively,  from  January  to  December);  market  interest  rates  had  risen \nsubstantially (e.g., from 7.5% in January to 19% in July for 3-month deposits).  \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP.

However, for \na country following the pegged regime and suffering from high inflation like Viet Nam, it \nseems to be very difficult for the monetary authorities to do so. In this case, the SBV \nshould curb inflation pressures while maintaining the pegged regime.  \n\nApart  from  the  first  model,  results  from  the  second  model  show  that  overvalue  is \nunderperformed in issuing a signal of currency crisis in Viet Nam. In practice, by taking \nan empirical test of the Marshall Lerner condition, Pham (2003) and Pham et al. (2013) \nfound  that  exchange  rate  was  not  significant  factor  for  enhancing  the  country\u2019s  trade \nbalance status. These could be the reasons for the unclear empirical results on impact \nof overvalue on currency crisis in Viet Nam. \n\nFigure 4: International Reserves in Import\u2019s Week in Viet Nam, 2001\u2013Feb 2016 \n(in millions of US dollar \u2013 the left axis; in weeks \u2013 the right axis) \n\n \nSource:  Author\u2019s  calculations  from  data  extracted  from  the  General  Statistics  Office  (GSO)  and  the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s International Financial Statistics. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10  AmCham  Vietnam.

T. H. Ahn \n\nFourth, the probit model does find significantly positive coefficients between a reduction \nin international reserves in import\u2019s weeks and probability of currency crisis especially \nfor the second model. In other words, the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves could be \nconsidered as a good signal of a currency crisis in Viet Nam in the sense that, if this \nindicator  is  below  10  import\u2019s  weeks,  the  country  should  have  a  high  probability  of \nfacing  large  fluctuations  in  the  foreign  exchange  market.  This  variable  does  benefit \nfrom  statistically  significant  findings  in  studies  by  Kaminsky  (1998),  Nguyen  Thi  Kim \nThanh et al. (2008), Nguyen and Huynh (2009), and Comelli (2013).  \n\nThere  was  difference  between  de  jure  and  de  facto  exchange  rate  regimes  in \nViet Nam.  Although  Viet  Nam\u2019s  monetary  authorities  officially  announced  that  the \ncountry  follows  a  managed  float  exchange  rate,  12 by  looking  at  actual  volatility  of \nexchange  rate  (US  dollar/dong)  and  empirical  evidence  from  econometric  models,  it  \nis  considered  as  a  simple  dollar  peg  (Takagi  and  Pham  2011)  or  other  conventional \npegged  regime  and  stabilized  arrangement. 13  According  to  a  monetary  theory, \ninternational  reserves  play  a  very  important  role  in  stabilizing  the  foreign  exchange \nmarket,  especially  in  the  pegged  regime.  A  reduction  in  international  reserves,  for \nexample  below  threshold,  implies  that  the  country  does  not  have  enough  ability  in \nintervening  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  in  the  case  of  devaluation  pressure.  It, \ntherefore,  might  lead  to  a  high  probability  of  a  currency  crisis  in  Viet  Nam.  Figure  2 \nshows  a  significant  drop  in  Viet Nam\u2019s  international  reserves  from  a  top  of  26  weeks  \n(in  2008)  to  a  bottom  of  5  weeks  of  import  (2011).  This  was  also  a  period  of  sharp \nmovements in exchange rate in Viet Nam, namely a currency crisis.  \n\nFigure 5: Trade Balance and Trade Balance to Gross Domestic  \nProduct Ratio in Viet Nam, 1996\u20132016 \n(in millions of US dollar-the left axis; in percent-the right axis) \n\n \nSource:  Author\u2019s  calculations  from  data  extracted  from  the  General  Statistics  Office  (GSO)  and  the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s International Financial Statistics. \n\n                                                 \n12  Article  30,  Ordinance  on  Foreign  Exchange  approved  by  national  Assembly  of  Vietnam,  took  effect  on  \n\n1 July 2006.  \n\n13  Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (IMF), various issues. \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\nFifth,  this  paper  found  that  deficits  in  trade  balance  have  negative  impact  on  the \nprobability of currency crisis as expected, especially for the second model. According \nto  the  balance  of  payment  approach  to  exchange  rate  determination,  a  country  with \nlarge deficit in trade balance would lead to an excess demand of foreign currency in the \nforeign  exchange  market.  If  this  is  the  case,  devaluation  pressure  in  local  currency\u2019s \nvalue  could  increase  probability  of  a  currency  crisis.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  trade  balance  has \nbeen  in  deficit  for  a  long  time,  especially  during  2007\u20132010  (Figure  4).  The  finding \nsuggests  that  the  country  should  improve  its  trade  balance.  Policies  that  would  be \nbeneficial  toward  this  goal  include  (i)  enhancing  export  competitiveness  and  shifting \nexport pattern from raw materials to processed products, (ii) developing subordinating \nindustries, etc.  \n\nLast  but  not  the  least,  empirical  evidence  collected  from  all  probit  models  suggested \nthat Model 1 with window length of 2 months outperformed in comparison with Model 2. \nIn  other  words,  Model  1  could  be  the  best  model  for  predicting  a  currency  crisis  in \nViet Nam.  In  this  model,  explained/dependent  variable-CC  is  defined  based  on  the \nEMP  and  parallel  marker  premium,  and  all  explanatory  variables  are  expressed  in  its \nabsolute  values  with  window  length  of  2  months.  Empirical  results  suggested  that \nprobability  of  predicting  a  true  currency  crisis  was  77.5%;  probability  of  predicting  a \ncrisis-hit period with signal was 64.6%. However, we realized that, by converting each \nexplanatory  variable  to  a  dummy  (model  2),  some  useful  information  may  be  thrown \naway which can lead to less precise estimates of the coefficients. Therefore, this paper \nemploys  the  Model  3  written  in  Eview  software  program,  which  will  help  to  identify \nsuitable  thresholds  for  explanatory  variable  and  make  the  converting  process \nsmoother. Empirical results from Model 3 provide robust evidence on leading indicators \nof a currency crisis in Viet Nam. \n\n5.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nThis paper aims to identify leading indicators and a suitable EWS model of a currency \ncrisis  in  Viet  Nam  based  on  a  combination  of  parametric  and  non-parametric \napproaches with the exchange market pressure (EMP) index for the period 1996\u2013Feb \n2016. In this model, the dependent variable of currency crisis is not only determined by \nthe  EMP  index,  but  is  also  based  on  parallel  market  premium.  In  this  paper,  external \nshocks  (e.g.,  regional  or  global  financial  crisis  and  unexpected  changes  in  monetary \npolicy) are proved to be the most important indicator of a currency crisis in Viet Nam, \nwhich  is  significant  at  the  1%  level  for  all  tested  models.  In  other  words,  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nfinancial  market,  especially  foreign  exchange  market,  is  easily  vulnerable  to  external \nshock  in  the  international  financial  market.  This  finding  implies  that  the  SBV  should \nimplement a more flexible exchange rate regime so that it could absorb external shocks \neffectively.  In  addition,  with  relatively  small  international  reserves,  the  SBV  should \nactively respond to external shocks so that it could avoid or eliminate negative impact \nof  external  financial  shocks  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  in  general  and  on  the  financial \nmarket in particular. \n\nThis  paper  found  that  Model  1  (in  which  all  explanatory  variables  are  expressed  in  \nits  absolute  values  except  for  global  shocks  with  window  length  of  2  months) \noutperformed for predicting a currency crisis in Viet Nam. Empirical results of Model 1 \nsuggested that probability of predicting a true currency crisis was 77.5%; probability of \npredicting  a  crisis-hit  period  with  signal  was  64.6%.  However,  there  were  minor \nlimitations in our model in that capital flows were not included because of unavailability \nof  monthly  data  on  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  flows,  foreign  portfolio  investment \n(FPI)  flows,  worker\u2019s  remittance,  and  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  in \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP. T. H. Ahn \n\nViet Nam. In addition, this paper also applies Model 3, namely \u201cEWS-Vietnam\u201d written \nin Eviews software program that will help to identify suitable thresholds for explanatory \nvariable  and  make  the  converting  process  smoother.  This  finding  suggests  that  the \nSBV  should  use  Model  1  and  Model  3  to  identify  probability  of  a  currency  crisis  in \nViet Nam. \n\nEmpirical  evidence  obtained  from  the  two  types  of  EWS  model  for  a  currency  crisis \nconcluded that domestic credit growth rate is a leading indicator of a currency crisis in \nViet Nam. In other words, these indicators issue a significant signal of a currency crisis \nin  Viet  Nam  if  they  exceed  their  thresholds  suggested  in  this  paper.  These  findings \nsuggest  that  the  country  should  keep  domestic  credit  growth  rate  at  less  than  25%  \nso  that  probability  of  a  currency  crisis  could  be  reduced.  In  addition,  indicators  such  \nas  deficits  in  trade  balance,  money  supply  growth  rate,  and  international  reserves  \nin  import\u2019s  weeks  theoretically  should  be  good  indicators  but  are  all  statistically \ninsignificant.  One  might  infer  that  the  country  should  improve  its  trade  balance  by \n(i) enhancing export competitiveness and shifting export pattern from raw materials to \nprocessed products and (ii) developing subordinating industries.  \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 686 \n\nP.

This  paper  found  that  global \nfinancial shocks (e.g., regional and global financial crisis, unexpected changes in monetary \npolicy of largest economies such as the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China), \nand domestic credit growth rate are leading indicators of a currency crisis in Viet Nam in all \nthree models. Deficits in trade balance, international reserves, and overvaluation of the dong \nare also good indicators. In addition, a model in which a currency crisis or turbulence in the \nforeign  exchange  market  is  defined  based  on  the  exchange  market  pressure  and  parallel \nmarket  premium,  with  window  length  of  2  months,  outperformed  for  predicting  a  currency \ncrisis in Viet Nam. Empirical results suggested that probability of predicting a true currency \ncrisis was 77.5%. \n \nJEL Classification: F31, E52, C32 \n \n", " \n"]}
