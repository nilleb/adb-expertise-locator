T. H. Ahn \n1.  INTRODUCTION \nThe main objective of this paper is to identify leading indicators and a suitable early \nwarning system (EWS) model of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. The EWS for currency \ncrisis was built to aim at identifying abnormal fluctuations and recession in the foreign \nexchange  market  in  advance  to  allow  governments  to  adopt  preemptive  policy \nmeasures (Kaminsky et al. 1998). However, forecasting the exact time of a currency \ncrisis is likely complicated not only for policy makers but also for researchers.  \nAlmost all studies on the EWS for a currency crisis employ either parametric approach \n(i.e.,  regression-based)  or  non-parametric  approach  (or  signal  approach)  (Comelli \n2013). The signal approach for a currency crisis was developed by Kaminsky and \nReinhart (1996), Frankel and Rose (1996), Kaminsky et al. (1998), Kaminsky and \nReinhart (1999), Berg and Pattillo (1999), and Zhuang (2005). For a signal approach, \nvulnerability indicators were transformed into a weighted average of binary signals. The \nauthors  evaluated  the  validity  of  both  macroeconomic  and  financial  indicators  in \npredicting a currency crisis in advance in which they compared the behavior of these \nvariables in periods preceding crises. Deviations of these variables from their \u201cnormal\u201d \nlevels beyond a certain threshold value could issue warning signals of a currency crisis \nwithin  a  specified  period  of  time  (Kaminsky  et  al.  1998).  According  to  the  paper, \n105 indicators were listed and classified into six groups, including the external sector, \nthe financial sector, the real sector, the public finances, institutional and structural \nvariables, and political variables. However, among them, export, money supply growth, \ndeficits in current accounts, real overvaluation, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, \nfiscal  deficits,  international  reserves  to  short-term  debt  ratio,  as  well  as  financial \nstability, were found to issue signals for a currency crisis within the next 24 months. \nUnlike a signal approach, the parametric EWS is regression-based, typically logit or \nprobit, where the crisis variable is regressed on a set of macroeconomic and financial \nindicators. It, therefore, could estimate probability of forecasting a true crisis. Based on \na  multivariate  probit-based  methodology,  Berg  and  Pattillo  (1999)  found  that  this \napproach  outperformed  non-parametric  in  terms  of  scores  and  goodness-of-fit  in \nforecasting  the  1997  crisis.  Bussiere  and  Fratzscher  (2006)  applied  a  multinomial  \nlogit regression-based EWS and argued that the model is outperformed binomial one  \nin predicting episodes of a currency crisis in 32 emerging markets for the period  \n1993\u20132001. Moreover, the paper shed light on defining a currency crisis by employing \nexchange market pressure (EMP) in the parametric model. Similar to Bussiere and \nFratzscher (2006), Aizenman and Hutchison (2012) focused on the extent that the \nglobal  financial  crisis  caused  external  market  pressure  and  found  that  emerging \ncountries with higher total foreign liabilities had greater exposure and were much more \nvulnerable to the financial crisis.  \nEWS  for  a  banking  and  currency  crisis  has  also  been  studied  by  Vietnamese \nresearchers such as Nguyen Thi Kim Thanh et al. (2008), Nguyen Ngoc Duy and \nHuynh Ngoc Huy (2009), Nguyen Xuan Trinh et al. (2010), and Ho Thanh Son (2012). \nMost of them employed the non-parametric methodology to identify indicators for a \ncurrency crisis. Nguyen Thi Kim Thanh et al. (2008) found that 39 macroeconomic and \nfinancial indicators, such as international reserves, short-term debt to international \nreserves ratio, and foreign currency liabilities to foreign currency assets in banking \nsystem, could issue signals of a crisis. On the other hand, an EWS study by Nguyen \nXuan Trinh et al. (2010) found that current account to GDP ratio outperformed others in \npredicting a currency crisis in Viet Nam.  \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P. T. H. Ahn \nThis paper contributes to the EWS existing literature in novel ways as follows. First, this \nis the first time global shock is considered as one of leading indicators in the EWS \nmodel for a currency crisis. The model found that this variable impacts negatively and \nsignificantly on probability of a crisis. Second, while most studies on EWS of a crisis  \nin Viet Nam employed non-parametric models (Nguyen Thi Kim Thanh et al. 2008, \nNguyen Ngoc Duy and Huynh Ngoc Huy 2009, Ho Thanh Son 2012), the author \nemployed a combination of parametric and non-parametric approaches for identifying \nindicators and probability of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. Explanatory variables in this \nmodel could be in the absolute form (model 1) or be coded as \u201c1\u201d if its value exceeds \nthe threshold and \u201c0\u201d otherwise (model 2). Third, to overcome limitations of model 2, \nthis paper employs model 3 in which codes are written in Eviews program that could \navoid manual converting explanatory variables into dummy ones. In this program, we \nset the maximum number of errors of 1000 and grid search of three. Fourth, unlike \nrecent  studies  on  EWS  in  Viet  Nam,  this  paper  uses  real  overvaluation  as  an \nexplanatory variable of a currency crisis model instead of nominal exchange rates. \nLastly, this research extends study period from 1996 to February 2016 so that it covers \nall recent crises (Asian financial crisis, the global financial crisis, European debt crisis, \nand unexpected shocks in monetary policies of large economies such as the United \nStates [US] and the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC]) that could cause negative \nimpacts on Viet Nam\u2019s economy in general, and on the financial market in particular. \nThe main findings of this paper are as follows. First, this paper found that global \nfinancial  shocks  (e.g.,  regional  and  global  financial  crisis,  unexpected  changes  in \nmonetary policy of largest economies such as the US and the PRC), and domestic \ncredit growth rate are leading indicators of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. Others, such \nas deficits in trade balance, international reserves in import\u2019s weeks and overvalue  \nof dong, should be good signals of a currency crisis. Second, among three main \nmodels (including of six sub-models) with different window lengths, model 1 (in which \ndependent variable, currency crisis (CC), is defined based on the EMP and parallel \nmarket premium, and all explanatory variables are expressed in absolute values with a \nwindow length of 2 months) outperformed in predicting a currency crisis-hit period in \nViet Nam. Empirical results of model 1 suggested that the probability of predicting a \ntrue currency crisis was 77.5%; probability of predicting a crisis-hit period with signal \nwas 64.6%.  \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 will give an overview of \nexchange rate policy developments in Viet Nam. Section 3 will give a definition of a \ncurrency crisis in Viet Nam based on the EMP index and other events in which the \ncentral bank, the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), launched their policy measure related \nto exchange rate. Section 4 employs parametric and non-parametric models to identify \nleading indicators and probability of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. In addition, Model 3 \nis also applied to check robustness of findings. The results obtained from models and \ncomments on these will be presented in section 4. Section 5 presents the summary \nand conclusion.  \n   \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P. T. H. Ahn \n2.  EXCHANGE RATE POLICY DEVELOPMENTS  \nIN VIET NAM \nAfter the reunification of Viet Nam on 30 April 1975, the socialism model applied \nthroughout the country and confidence among Vietnamese was at an all-time high. The \ndong was valued at only a little less than $1.00.1 At that time, it was a centrally planned \neconomy with government\u2019s intervention in all macro- and microeconomic policies.  \nThis model used to be very effective and efficient in wartime, but in the long run, it \ndistorted and severed a supply\u2013demand law in the market as well as caused many \nserious economic consequences. Obviously, market realities soon forced a change. On \n14 September 1985, a new dong note was issued with denomination at 10 times the \nvalue of the old dong. This action led panic through the markets as people rushed to \ndump dong in favor of purchasing commodities and staples. This, in turn, sparked \n4 years of spiralling inflation, which reached an all-time high of 600% in 1989. \nWith an unstable macroeconomic background before 1988, Viet Nam applied a regime \nin  which  the  exchange  rate  was  determined  by  comparing  internal  and  external \npurchasing  power  of  currencies  and  then  set  by  multi-parties  agreements  among \ncommunist countries. In other words, the exchange rate was totally determined by the \nGovernment of Viet Nam, ignoring the currency\u2019s supply and demand factors. Another \ncharacteristic of Viet Nam\u2019s exchange rate regime at that time was a multi-exchange \nrate  which  consisted  of  official  or  trade  exchange  rate,  non-trade  exchange  rate, \ninternal exchange rate, and parallel market rate. The regime, therefore, caused serious \nconsequences for Viet Nam\u2019s economy, including (i) the overvaluation of the dong in \ncomparison with hard currencies such as US dollar, pound sterling, French franc, \nDeutch mark, and yen; (ii) a wider gap between official and black market exchange rate \n(parallel  market  premium)  caused  loss  of  public  confidence  in  dong\u2019s  value;  and \n(iii) Viet Nam\u2019s competitiveness was harmed, which led to a heavy deficit in both the \ntrade account and the current account.  \nAs part of its economic renovation program, Viet Nam reformed the financial and \nbanking sector by establishing a two-tier banking system in 1988 under which the SBV, \nas  the  central  bank,  was  separated  from  the  four  state-owned  commercial  banks \n(Rosegard and Huynh 2008, Tien N.V. 2012). Moreover, the two-tier banking system \ndid not function as expected because the SBV was still a part of the state bureaucracy. \nTo create a favorable legal environment for the operations of the central bank, the \ngovernment approved the Ordinance on the State Bank of Viet Nam in which the term \n\u201cmonetary policy\u201d was formally used for the first time. Although the SBV at the time was \nstill following the old operating mechanism, the law clarified the objective of monetary \nmanagement as that of stabilizing prices and the exchange rates. \nDuring the Asian financial crisis, while most currencies in Asia (such as Thai baht, \nIndonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit, etc.) suffered from large devaluations against the \nUS dollar and other hard currencies, the SBV kept the US dollar/dong exchange rate \nstable. This would lead to a large real overvaluation of the dong against the US dollar \nand harmed competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s goods and services. Therefore, severe \ndeficits  in  trade  balance  were  observed  during  1996\u20131999.  To  avoid  unexpected \nconsequences  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  Viet  Nam  implemented  a  \u201ccautious\u201d \nexchange rate policy that allowed a gradual devaluation in dong, combined with strict  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Brahm, Laurence J, Nhi, Le Trong, Jul/Aug 1993. pp.194. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P. T. H. Ahn \nexchange controls. It was known as an adjustable (or effective) pegged exchange  \nrate regime that could help the country stabilize real effective exchange rate (REER) \n(Ohno 1999) and, therefore, improve trade balances to be positive for the first time  \never in 1999.  \nTo overcome economic and financial problems caused by the Asian financial crisis, \nstabilize exchange rates, and enhance economic reform, the SBV\u2019s Governor approved \nDecision No. 64/1999/QD-NHNN7 and Decision No. 65/1999/QD-NHNN7 on exchange \nmanagement.  Since  25  February  1999,  the  SBV  has  followed  the  practice  of \nannouncing, on each working day, an official US dollar exchange rate of the dong, \nalong with a trading band, on the basis of the average actual exchange rates of \npreceding  days  in  the  interbank  market.  The  trading  rate  at  commercial  banks  is \ndetermined freely among the licensed banks, subject to the requirement that buying \nand selling rates remain within the ceilings and floors established around the official \nrate of + 0.1%, then \u00b10.25% (effective on 1 July 2002). Therefore, instead of fixed \nexchange  rate  regime,  in  early  1999,  Viet  Nam  followed  a  type  of  crawling  peg \nexchange rate system, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classifies as a  \n\u201cde facto managed floating regime (managed floating with no pre-announced path for \nexchange rate).\u201d While Viet Nam officially announced to follow a managed floating \nexchange rate system,2 the current exchange rate system functions like a category of \nconventional pegged arrangement against a single currency (2005\u20132007).3 In addition, \nsince 2004, the Governor of the SBV has announced the exchange rate targets at the \nbeginning of each year. It is suggested that the SBV use the exchange rate as a \nnominal anchor in implementing its monetary policy.  \nHowever, due to negative impacts in 2007, turbulences were seen on the foreign \nexchange market, such as exchange rate reached the top of 19,800 in June 2008 \n(about 16% higher than the official rate). Moreover, public confidence in dong value \nwas  harmful,  significantly  leading  to  an  increase  in  deposit  dollarization  index. \nTherefore,  the  SBV  had  to  implement  exchange  rate  policy  measures  to  stabilize  \nboth official and parallel markets, such as (i) devaluing the official exchange rate, \n(ii) widening  the  trading  band  on  either  sides  of  the  official  exchange  rate, \n(iii) increasing interest rates, and (iv) and administrative measures that are summarized \nin Tables 1 and 2. After the stabilization period of 2012\u20132014, turbulences emerged in \nthe  foreign  exchange  due  to  unexpected  changes  in  monetary  policies  of  large \neconomies such as the PRC and the US in 2015. In response, the central bank had to \ndevalue the dong three times and widen the trading band on either side of the official \nrate from \u00b11% to \u00b13%. \n   \n                                                 \n2  See Decree 63/1998/ND-CP on foreign exchange management and Ordinance on Foreign exchange for \nmore details. \n3  IMF has reclassified the exchange rate regime of Viet Nam to the category of conventional pegged \narrangement, from the category of managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate \n(effective on 1 January 2005)- Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, \n2006 (AREAER).  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P.

MODEL SPECIFICATIONS \n3.1  Currency Crisis or Foreign Exchange Market Turbulences \nin Viet Nam  \nThe EWS of a currency crisis could be valuable for policy makers in the sense that it \ncould be used for detecting underlying economic weakness and vulnerabilities, and \nallowing the adoption of preemptive measures to reduce the risks of experiencing a \ncrisis (Bussiere and Fratzscher 2006). Currency crisis usually refers to a situation in \nwhich the economy is under pressure of a sharp depreciation in local currency value. \nTherefore, in most papers, currency crisis is defined as (i) large devaluations adjusted \nfor interest rate differentials, and (ii) large devaluations which exceed the devaluation in \nthe previous period by some multiple (Kumar et al. 2003). In this case, the monetary \nauthorities have to defend the domestic currency by selling foreign exchange reserves \nor raising the domestic interest rate (Glick and Hutchison 2011). \n   \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P.

In  practice,  parallel  rate  is  totally \ndetermined  by  demand  and  supply  conditions,  and  is,  in  principle,  not  subject  to \nregulations by the SBV, while official rate seemed to be constant overtime (set by the \nSBV). Therefore, parallel rate will immediately react to any unexpected changes in \ndemand and supply leading to a gap (parallel market premium) between parallel and \nofficial  rate.  If  parallel  market  premium  is  becoming  larger,  the  SBV  should  sell \ninternational reserves to stabilize FOREX and launch a comprehensive package of \npolicy measures to stabilize the market (see more in Tables 1 and 2). \n3.2  Parametric or Non-parametric Model \nThe EWS of financial crisis, banking crisis, and currency crisis could be based on \nparametric  (i.e.,  regression  based)  and  non-parametric  approach  (crisis  signal \nextraction). By using regression methodology of discrete variables such as logit and \nprobit, parametric approach to EWS of financial crises is employed to estimate the \nprobability of crisis. Based on the non-parametric approach, Kaminsky et al. (1998) \nargue a set of leading indicators that could issue good signal of a currency crisis in the \nnext  24  months.  In  that  study,  the  authors  employed  event  study  to  find  out \ndevelopments of macroeconomic indicators as well as financial variables (i.e., domestic \ncredit growth rate, money supply growth rate, deficits in state budget and current \naccounts,  real  overvaluation,  international  reserves)  before  a  crisis-hit  period.  The \nsimilar model and findings could be found in some studies, such as Frankel and Rose \n(1996), and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), where they used annual data on a set of \ncountries to estimate causes of a financial crisis. However, it was not suitable for \npredicting probability of a financial crisis.  \nTo  overcome  this  problem,  recent  studies,  such  as  Berg  et  al.  (2005)  with  the \ndeveloping  country  studies  division  (DCSD)  model,  Beckmann  et  al.  (2006),  and \nComelli (2013), used monthly data to calculate the probability of a currency crisis in \nreal  time.  In  the  non-parametric  EWS,  the  crisis  probability  Pt  is  calculated  as  a \nweighted  average  of  crisis  signals  issued  by  a  set  of  selected  macroeconomic \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P. T. H. Ahn \nindicators. To establish when an indicator is issuing a crisis signal, there is a need to \nchoose a threshold. If an indicator exceeds the threshold, it is considered to issue a \ncrisis signal.  \nNon-parametric  EWS  is  very  simple,  but  its  limitation  is  that  it  assumes  linearity \nrelationship between indicators of a currency crisis. On the other hand, the parametric \napproach  to  EWS  helps  in  identifying  probability  of  a  currency  crisis.  In  terms  \nof  performance,  Beckmann  et  al.  (2006)  and  Comelli  (2013)  suggested  that  \nthe  parametric  EWS  achieves  superior  out-of-sample  results  compared  with  the  \nnon-parametric EWS. Moreover, this approach combines all variables simultaneously \nand disregards variables that do not contribute information to the model (Kaminsky  \net  al.  1998).  However,  it  still  has  some  limitations  such  as  (i)  not  providing  a \nquantitative  ranking  measure  for  indicators  based  on  their  ability  of  predicting  a \ncurrency  crisis,  and  (ii)  not  providing  a  transparent  reading  of  where  and  how \nwidespread macroeconomic problems are (Kaminsky et al. 1998). \nIn this research, I, therefore, will combine both parametric and non-parametric methods \nto identify leading indicators as well as probability of a currency crisis in Viet Nam.

Parallel Market Premium: \nCurrency crisis in Viet Nam will happen if the parallel market premium is 5% higher \nthan the official trading band. For calculating parallel market premium, exchange rate of \nUS dollar/dong is collected at the Ha Noi parallel market around 11 a.m. of working \ndays  (for  parallel  exchange  rate)  and  from  the  SBV\u2019s  official  website  (for  official \nexchange rate).  \n3.2.2  Independent/Explanatory Variables  \nAccording to Kaminsky et al.

Explanatory  variables  in  the  \nnon-parametric model will not be in absolute value, they are usually coded as \u201c1\u201d if its \nvalue is above the threshold, otherwise the contrary outcome as \u201c0.\u201d Therefore, the \nmost important thing in the EWS model of currency crisis is to determine the optimal \nthreshold of each explanatory variable so that the forecasting error would be reduced. \nIt is very difficult because a lower threshold may lead to the fact that some non-crisis \nevents are considered as a crisis (Type 2 error\u2014issuing a false alarm); and a higher \nthreshold may ignore some actual crisis (Type 1 error\u2014missing a crisis because the \nthreshold has been set too high).  \nBased on the macroeconomic background in Viet Nam, this paper assigns thresholds \nfor each explanatory variable (Table 3). However, to check robustness of findings, \nI also employ Model 3 written in Eviews software (in subsection 4.2). This program will \nhelp  to  identify  suitable  thresholds  for  explanatory  variable  and  make  converting \nprocess smoother. \n   \n                                                 \n4  www.sbv.gov.vn.  \n5  Openness ratio is calculated by taking sum of export and import over GDP.  \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P.

However, as mentioned earlier, the magnitude \nof Viet Nam\u2019s currency crisis is not large: it happened and lasted for a shorter period \nsuch as weeks, 1 month, or 2 months. Therefore, instead of 12 or 24 months, I will \nchoose window lengths of 1 month and 2 months for the EWS model of currency crisis \nin Viet Nam.  \nTo check the effectiveness of probit model in identifying leading indicators of currency \nturbulences in Viet Nam, I use two types of models. The first model (Model 1) is a \nlinear probit in which all explanatory variables are expressed in its absolute values, \nwhile the second model (Model 2) is also a linear probit, but all explanatory variables \nare coded as \u201c1\u201d if its value is above the threshold, otherwise coded as \u201c0.\u201d Moreover, \neach model is tested for different lengths of window such as 1 month and 2 months.

Ahn \nIn terms of the probability of predicting a true currency crisis (criterion-1), models with \nthresholds of DC=35 percent, RES=10 weeks, TB=-15 percent, and OVERVALUE=15 \npercent or 17.5 percent are selected as the best, with the probability 77.77%. The \nvalues of \u201cRES\u201d and \u201cTB\u201d match with the thresholds in Model 2. On the other hand, this \nresult suggests use of slightly higher thresholds for \u201cDC\u201d and \u201cOVERVALUE\u201d. However, \nthe performance of these models worsens in terms of criterion-2.  \nIn  terms  of  the  probability  of  currency  crises  with  signals  (criterion-2),  there  are  \nseven models which give the same probability. Again, the models suggest a slightly \nhigher threshold for \u201cDC\u201d. These models also suggest use of a slightly higher threshold \nfor  \u201cTB\u201d.  For  \u201cOVERVALUE\u201d  and  \u201cRES,\u201d  though  the  predictabilities  are  the  same  \nfor  different  combinations,  they  again  suggest  a  slightly  higher  threshold  for \n\u201cOVERVALUE\u201d. Talking about the \u201cRES,\u201d they are consistent with the setting of Model \n2. Again, the performance of these models worsens in terms of criterion-1. Overall, the \nresults confirm that the thresholds used in Model 2 are reasonable for \u201cRES\u201d and \u201cTB\u201d. \nFor \u201cDC\u201d and \u201cOVERVALUE,\u201d though the analysis suggests slightly higher thresholds, \nthe models with suggested thresholds cannot dominate Model 2 in terms of two criteria \nsimultaneously. Therefore, we reconfirm that thresholds of explanatory variables in \nModel 2 are reasonable for predicting a currency crisis in Viet Nam.  \n4.3  Comments on Results  \nIn general, we observed different roles of macroeconomic indicators in predicting a \ncurrency crisis in Viet Nam. Based on empirical results of the specified probit models \nwith different window lengths, some main findings are as follows:  \nFirst, external shocks (e.g., regional or global financial crisis and unexpected changes \nin monetary policy) are proved to be the most important indicator of a currency crisis in \nViet Nam which is significant at the 1% level for all tested models. In other words, Viet \nNam\u2019s financial market, especially foreign exchange market, is easily vulnerable to \nexternal shock in the international financial market. This finding could be explained by a \nhigh openness ratio in Viet Nam\u2019s economy.  \nFigure 1: External Shocks and Foreign Exchange Market Turbulences, 2006\u20132015 \n \nSource: www.sbv.gov.vn; www.vangsaigon.com.vn; and www.vcb.com.vn.  \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P. T. H. Ahn \nSecond, similar to external shock, our models find that high growth in domestic credit \nwas  also  considered  as  an  empirical  reason  of  a  currency  crisis  in  Viet  Nam  at \nsignificance level of 1% in all four models. This finding is consistent with theory as well \nas empirical evidence suggested by Kaminsky (1998), Berg and Pattillo (1999), and \nEdison (2003). A high growth rate of domestic credit would lead to a decrease in \nsoundness of commercial banks by increasing non-performing loan ratio, reducing the \nreturn  on  asset  (ROA)  and  return  on  equity  (ROE)  ratios,  etc.;  in  the  worst-case \nscenario, it could lead to a banking crisis. The world economy has witnessed a series \nof banking crises as well as currency crises which resulted from a boom in domestic \ncredit that happened not only in developed countries such as the US (the US subprime \nloan crisis in 2007\u20132008), Japan (in the early 1990s), but also in developing countries \n(East Asian countries in 1997). In some cases, banking and currency crises have \ntended to cluster and have come to be known as the \u201ctwin crises\u201d (Kaminsky 1998). \nBank lending was proved to be the most effective channel in transmission mechanism \nof monetary policy in Viet Nam (Nguyen Thanh Nhan et al. 2013, Pham Thi Hoang Anh \net  al.  2013)  so  that  the  SBV  has  been  employing  domestic  credit  growth  as  an \noperating  target.  High  credit  growth  rate  of  25%  was  seen  as  a  very  important \ndeterminant of economic growth in Viet Nam (To Ngoc Hung et al. 2013, Pham Thi \nHoang Anh et al. 2013). However, domestic credit growth rate above the threshold of \n25% will be harmful to assets\u2019 quality of Viet Nam\u2019s banking system. By relaxing the \ncondition for lending activities as a part of stimulus package in responses to negative \nimpacts of the global financial crisis, domestic credit to the economy increased sharply \nfrom 25% in 2007 to more than 50% in 2008 and 2010 (Figure 2). This fact led Viet \nNam\u2019s banking system to face many difficulties such as high nonperforming loan ratio,6 \nliquidity deficits,7 etc. The banking crisis and macroeconomic difficulties (high inflation \nrate, high unemployment, high deficit in trade balance, and tumble in the stock market) \nresulted in chaos in  gold  and  foreign  exchange  market  during  2010\u20132012.  These \nfindings suggest that the monetary authorities should set the target for domestic credit \nbelow 25%. Additionally, it could be inferred that the authorities also need to create a \nfavorable environment for developing other channels of capital transfer such as stock \nmarket and bond market, and then reducing the economy\u2019s independence on the \nbanking system.  \nThird, overvaluation is found to be one of leading indicators of currency crisis in Viet \nNam. In other words, the higher the overvaluation, the higher the probability of currency \ncrisis in Viet Nam, which is significant at the 1% level for the first model in which all \nexplanatory variables are expressed in its absolute values. This finding is consistent \nwith  those  of  Kaminsky  et  al.  (1998)  and  Llaudes  et  al.  (2010).  According  to \ninternational  trade  theory,  overvaluation  will  diminish  a  country\u2019s  competitiveness \nleading to an increase in import and a decrease in export. This movement will harm the \ntrade balance8 status resulting in depreciation pressure because of excess demand, \neven unexpected large fluctuations in the foreign exchange market.  \n \n                                                 \n6  According to the SBV report, nonperforming loan ratio is 17.21% after the SBV revaluates loans  \nin 2013. \n7  Because of liquidity shortage within Viet Nam\u2019s banking system, overnight and 1-month interbank \ninterest rate reached the top of about 16% and more than 30% per year in 18 October 2011, \nrespectively (http://kinhdoanh.vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/ebank/ngan-hang/lai-suat-lien-ngan-hang-len-30-ky-\nhan-mot-thang-2715756.html). \n8  Because of large overvaluation of the dong against the US dollar since 2008, the trade balance had \nbegun to record a large deficit of $14.21 billion in the first 6 months of 2008.  \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P.

However, for \na country following the pegged regime and suffering from high inflation like Viet Nam, it \nseems to be very difficult for the monetary authorities to do so. In this case, the SBV \nshould curb inflation pressures while maintaining the pegged regime.  \nApart from the first model, results from the second model show that overvalue is \nunderperformed in issuing a signal of currency crisis in Viet Nam.

Ahn \nFourth, the probit model does find significantly positive coefficients between a reduction \nin international reserves in import\u2019s weeks and probability of currency crisis especially \nfor the second model. In other words, the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves could be \nconsidered as a good signal of a currency crisis in Viet Nam in the sense that, if this \nindicator is below 10 import\u2019s weeks, the country should have a high probability of \nfacing large fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. This variable does benefit \nfrom statistically significant findings in studies by Kaminsky (1998), Nguyen Thi Kim \nThanh et al. (2008), Nguyen and Huynh (2009), and Comelli (2013).  \nThere  was  difference  between  de  jure  and  de  facto  exchange  rate  regimes  in \nViet Nam.  Although  Viet  Nam\u2019s  monetary  authorities  officially  announced  that  the \ncountry follows a managed float exchange rate,  12 by looking at actual volatility of \nexchange rate (US dollar/dong) and empirical evidence from econometric models, it  \nis considered as a simple dollar peg (Takagi and Pham 2011) or other conventional \npegged  regime  and  stabilized  arrangement. 13  According  to  a  monetary  theory, \ninternational reserves play a very important role in stabilizing the foreign exchange \nmarket, especially in the pegged regime. A reduction in international reserves, for \nexample below threshold, implies that the country does not have enough ability in \nintervening in the foreign exchange market in the case of devaluation pressure. It, \ntherefore, might lead to a high probability of a currency crisis in Viet Nam. Figure 2 \nshows a significant drop in Viet Nam\u2019s international reserves from a top of 26 weeks  \n(in 2008) to a bottom of 5 weeks of import (2011). This was also a period of sharp \nmovements in exchange rate in Viet Nam, namely a currency crisis.  \nFigure 5: Trade Balance and Trade Balance to Gross Domestic  \nProduct Ratio in Viet Nam, 1996\u20132016 \n(in millions of US dollar-the left axis; in percent-the right axis) \n \nSource: Author\u2019s calculations from data extracted from the General Statistics Office (GSO) and the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s International Financial Statistics. \n                                                 \n12  Article 30, Ordinance on Foreign Exchange approved by national Assembly of Vietnam, took effect on  \n1 July 2006.  \n13  Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (IMF), various issues. \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P. T. H. Ahn \nFifth, this paper found that deficits in trade balance have negative impact on the \nprobability of currency crisis as expected, especially for the second model. According \nto the balance of payment approach to exchange rate determination, a country with \nlarge deficit in trade balance would lead to an excess demand of foreign currency in the \nforeign exchange market. If this is the case, devaluation pressure in local currency\u2019s \nvalue could increase probability of a currency crisis. Viet Nam\u2019s trade balance has \nbeen in deficit for a long time, especially during 2007\u20132010 (Figure 4). The finding \nsuggests that the country should improve its trade balance. Policies that would be \nbeneficial toward this goal include (i) enhancing export competitiveness and shifting \nexport pattern from raw materials to processed products, (ii) developing subordinating \nindustries, etc.  \nLast but not the least, empirical evidence collected from all probit models suggested \nthat Model 1 with window length of 2 months outperformed in comparison with Model 2. \nIn other words, Model 1 could be the best model for predicting a currency crisis in \nViet Nam. In this model, explained/dependent variable-CC is defined based on the \nEMP and parallel marker premium, and all explanatory variables are expressed in its \nabsolute values with window length of 2 months. Empirical results suggested that \nprobability of predicting a true currency crisis was 77.5%; probability of predicting a \ncrisis-hit period with signal was 64.6%. However, we realized that, by converting each \nexplanatory variable to a dummy (model 2), some useful information may be thrown \naway which can lead to less precise estimates of the coefficients. Therefore, this paper \nemploys the Model 3 written in Eview software program, which will help to identify \nsuitable  thresholds  for  explanatory  variable  and  make  the  converting  process \nsmoother. Empirical results from Model 3 provide robust evidence on leading indicators \nof a currency crisis in Viet Nam. \n5.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \nThis paper aims to identify leading indicators and a suitable EWS model of a currency \ncrisis  in  Viet  Nam  based  on  a  combination  of  parametric  and  non-parametric \napproaches with the exchange market pressure (EMP) index for the period 1996\u2013Feb \n2016. In this model, the dependent variable of currency crisis is not only determined by \nthe EMP index, but is also based on parallel market premium. In this paper, external \nshocks (e.g., regional or global financial crisis and unexpected changes in monetary \npolicy) are proved to be the most important indicator of a currency crisis in Viet Nam, \nwhich is significant at the 1% level for all tested models. In other words, Viet Nam\u2019s \nfinancial market, especially foreign exchange market, is easily vulnerable to external \nshock in the international financial market. This finding implies that the SBV should \nimplement a more flexible exchange rate regime so that it could absorb external shocks \neffectively. In addition, with relatively small international reserves, the SBV should \nactively respond to external shocks so that it could avoid or eliminate negative impact \nof external financial shocks on Viet Nam\u2019s economy in general and on the financial \nmarket in particular. \nThis paper found that Model 1 (in which all explanatory variables are expressed in  \nits  absolute  values  except  for  global  shocks  with  window  length  of  2  months) \noutperformed for predicting a currency crisis in Viet Nam. Empirical results of Model 1 \nsuggested that probability of predicting a true currency crisis was 77.5%; probability of \npredicting  a  crisis-hit  period  with  signal  was  64.6%.  However,  there  were  minor \nlimitations in our model in that capital flows were not included because of unavailability \nof monthly data on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, foreign portfolio investment \n(FPI)  flows,  worker\u2019s  remittance,  and  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  in \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 686  P.

In addition, this paper also applies Model 3, namely \u201cEWS-Vietnam\u201d written \nin Eviews software program that will help to identify suitable thresholds for explanatory \nvariable and make the converting process smoother. This finding suggests that the \nSBV should use Model 1 and Model 3 to identify probability of a currency crisis in \nViet Nam. \nEmpirical evidence obtained from the two types of EWS model for a currency crisis \nconcluded that domestic credit growth rate is a leading indicator of a currency crisis in \nViet Nam. In other words, these indicators issue a significant signal of a currency crisis \nin Viet Nam if they exceed their thresholds suggested in this paper. These findings \nsuggest that the country should keep domestic credit growth rate at less than 25%  \nso that probability of a currency crisis could be reduced. In addition, indicators such  \nas deficits in trade balance, money supply growth rate, and international reserves  \nin  import\u2019s  weeks  theoretically  should  be  good  indicators  but  are  all  statistically \ninsignificant.

We found that global financial shocks (e.g., regional and global financial crises, unexpected changes in monetary policy of the largest economies such as the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China), and domestic credit growth rate are leading indicators of a currency crisis in Viet Nam in all three models. Deficits in trade balance, international reserves, and overvaluation of the dong are also good indicators. In addition, a model in which a currency crisis or turbulence in the foreign exchange market is defined based on the exchange market pressure and parallel market premium, with window length of 2 months, outperformed for predicting a currency crisis in Viet Nam. Empirical results suggested that probability of predicting a true currency crisis was 77.5%.", "Title": "Are Global Shocks Leading Indicators of A Currency Crisis in Viet Nam?"}}
