INtRoDuCtIoN\nMany emerging countries in recent decades have relied on a development strategy focused on \npromoting the manufacturing sector and the export of manufactured goods. These include many East \nAsian countries and most recently, the People\u2019s Republic of China. India, too, hoped for a dynamic \nmanufacturing sector when it introduced substantial product market reforms in its manufacturing \nsector starting in the mid-1980s. But the sector never took off as it did in other countries. India \nno doubt has grown impressively in the last 15 years; however, the main contribution to growth \nhas come from the services sector rather than from the manufacturing sector. Moreover, in so \nfar as subsectors within manufacturing that have performed well, these have been the relatively \ncapital- or skill-intensive industries, not the labor-intensive ones as would be expected for a labor-\nabundant country like India. What could be the reasons behind the rather lackluster performance \nof the manufacturing sector in India? \nAs \ufffdigure 1 shows, the manufacturing sector\u2019s share in India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has \nbeen stagnant since the early 1990s despite several wide-ranging reforms in this sector. Similarly, \n\ufffdigure 2 shows that the contribution to GDP growth has primarily been from the services sector, \nand this contribution has been increasing over time. \nFIGURE 1\nSECTORAL SHARES IN GDP, INDIA\n60\n50\nServices\n40\nAgriculture\n30\n20\nManufacturing\n10\n0\n1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006\n    Sources: Authors\u2019 calculations, Central Statistical Organi\ufffdation (India).", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\nFIGURE 2\nSECTORAL CONTRIBUTION TO INDIAN GDP GROWTH, 1951\u20132007\n60\n50\nnt) 40\ne\nc\ner\np\nh ( 30\nwt\no\ngr\nP \nGD 20\no \nn t\no\nuti 10\nb\nntri\no\nC\n0\nServices Industry Agriculture\n1951\u20131960 1980\u201311990 1990\u20132000 2000\u20132007\n    Sources: Authors\u2019 calculations, Central Statistical Organi\ufffdation (India).\nSeveral hypotheses have been put forward to explain the lack of dynamism in India\u2019s \nmanufacturing sector. Infrastructure-related bottlenecks are widely believed to be a part of the \nexplanation. In particular, poor quality of power supply, road networks, and ports and airports are \nbelieved to create significant disadvantages for Indian manufacturers by pushing up their costs of \nproduction, and making them uncompetitive in export markets.1\nBesides infrastructure, some key areas of policies remain unchanged. In particular, even though \nthere have been extensive product market reforms, it has been widely observed that the labor market \nreforms to complement these have not been undertaken (see Panagariya 2006 and 2008, Kochhar \net al. 2006). Moreover, credit constraints due to weaknesses in the financial sector may be holding \nback small- and medium-si\ufffde firms from expanding (see Banerjee and Duflo 2004, Nagaraj 2005, \nMcKinsey 2006).2 \ufffdinally, business regulations might have influenced key decisions of firms and \npotential investors. As the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business surveys of business regulations across the \nworld have found, the procedures and costs for starting and, especially, closing a manufacturing \nbusiness in India are among the most cumbersome in the world.\ufffd\n1 As indicated in Gordon and Gupta (2004), the nature of production of services is probably such that it is less affected \nby infrastructure bottlenecks.\n2 Banerjee and Duflo (2004) use firm-level data from the late 1990s and early 2000s and show that medium-si\ufffde firms\u2014\neven those well above the \u201csmall scale\u201d threshold\u2014were subject to credit constraints and appeared to be operating \nwell below their optimal scale. \n\ufffd Another possibility is that hysteresis in the pattern of development in Indian manufacturing implies that the relative \nprofitability of capital- and skill-intensive activities remains higher than that of labor-intensive activities despite the \nreforms of the early 1990s (Kochhar et al. 2006). Other factors often believed to be affecting the performance of \n\u0018  August 2008", "seCtion i\nintroduCtion\nIt would be useful to empirically test the hypotheses related to the idea that various elements \nof the policy and institutional environment facing the manufacturing sector\u2014either left untouched by \nthe liberali\ufffdations of the 1990s or dealt with only partially\u2014have emerged as significant bottlenecks \nto growth and employment generation.\nOne obvious way to test these hypotheses is to exploit interstate heterogeneity in the policy \nand institutional environment, including labor market regulations, financial sector development, \nand infrastructure for different states of India; and then to test whether industrial performance \nhas been better in the states with better policy and institutional framework. This is precisely what \nhas been done in the existing literature to show the importance of labor market flexibilities in \nexplaining the gains from product market liberali\ufffdation. Besley and Burgess (2004), for example, \nexploit state-level amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA)\u2014 arguably the most important \nset of labor regulations governing Indian industry\u2014over 1958\u20131992, and code legislative changes \nacross major states as pro-worker, neutral, or pro-employer. These legislative amendments are then \nused in the regression analyses of various outcomes in the manufacturing sector, including output, \nemployment, investment, and number of factories. Besley and Burgess find that pro-worker labor \nregulations have had a negative impact on output, employment, and investment in organi\ufffded \nmanufacturing.4 \nA related paper by Aghion et al. (2006) relates various dimensions of industrial performance \nto the extent to which an industry was covered by industrial licensing requirements, and state-level \nmeasures of the stance of labor regulations. They find that the effects of industrial delicensing were \nunequal across Indian states. In particular, delicensed industries located in states with pro-employer \nlabor regulations grew faster in terms of both output and employment levels than those with pro-\nworker regulations. Similarly, Mitra and Ural (2007) show that industries experiencing larger tariff \nreductions grew faster in pro-employer states relative to pro-worker states.5\nIn this paper we relate the pattern of growth in India\u2019s manufacturing sector to cross industry \nheterogeneity in the reliance on infrastructure and the financial sector and in the use of labor \nrelative to capital. In particular, we calculate the dependence of industries on infrastructure and \nthe financial sector, and the labor intensity of industries. Using Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) \ndata at the \ufffd-digit level, we employ difference in differences estimates to compare the performance \nof industries more dependent on infrastructure, on the financial sector, and on labor-intensive \nindustries post-delicensing with that of the control group.\nOur results indicate that the aggregate performance of the manufacturing sector masks \nimportant interindustry differences. Quite interestingly, we find that the industries with greater \nneed for infrastructure, greater dependence on the financial sector, and greater labor intensity \nhave performed relatively worse in the post-delicensing period. Quantitatively, the results indicate \nIndian manufacturing are public ownership of enterprises, remaining reservations in small-scale industries, and stringent \nregulations on land use in India as discussed in Panagariya (2008). In recent years the availability of skilled labor has \nalso emerged as a constraint on the growth of manufacturing and services.\n4 While, in principle, the approach of Besley and Burgess (2004) has considerable merit, it is not without controversy. Bhattacharjee \n(2006), in particular, has argued that deciding whether an individual amendment to the IDA is pro-employer or pro-worker in \nan objective manner is quite difficult. Even if individual amendments can be so coded, the actual workings of the regulations \ncan hinge on judicial interpretations of the amendments. Moreover, if noncompliance with regulations is widespread, then \neven an accurate coding of amendments that takes into account the appropriate judicial interpretation loses its meaning. \n5 There are some differences between Mitra and Ural (2007) and Aghion et al. (2006) in terms of the states deemed to \nhave pro-employer or pro-worker labor regulations. See Mitra and Ural (2007) for details.\n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  \u0018", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\nthat in the post-delicensing period, the above-median, infrastructure-intensive industries grew \n10% less than the industries below the median of infrastructure dependence. Similarly, industries \nabove-median in the distribution of financial dependence grew 18% less than the industries below \nthe median of financial dependence; and for labor intensity, industries with above-median labor \nintensity grew 19% less than the below-median industries post-delicensing. \nThere are two ways to interpret these results. \ufffdirst, one can use the results to identify which \nindustries have not benefited much from reforms. Second, to the extent that the heterogeneity \nacross industries on parameters such as infrastructure dependence is exogenous and determined \nby factors such as production technology, causal inferences may probably be drawn as well. Thus, \nfor example, we can claim that if industries dependent on infrastructure have not benefited as \nmuch from reforms, it is because of the unavailability of adequate infrastructure; the same is true \nfor financial sector-dependent industries. \ufffdor labor-intensive industries, an interpretation in terms \nof the limited supplies of labor would not be appropriate in the Indian context. A more natural \ninterpretation would be to relate the relatively weak performance of labor-intensive industries to \nthe quality of labor, skill mismatch, and regulations on employment that make the effective price \nof hiring labor too high. \nIn order to ensure that the results are not driven by outliers; that the standard errors are \ncorrected for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation; and that the estimates are not biased due \nto omitted variables, we conduct extensive robustness tests, and find our results to be robust to \nthese sensitivity analyses. \nThere are two conclusions that can be drawn from these results. \ufffdirst, product market reforms \nalone might not be sufficient to spur growth; for gains from these reforms to be maximi\ufffded they \nmay have to be complemented by reforms in other areas. Second, the potential benefits from product \nmarket reforms might not be reali\ufffded unless these are matched by enabling conditions such as high-\nquality infrastructure, availability of the right kind of labor, and financial markets that are deep \nenough. There is no room for complacency, and efforts should be made to remove these constraints \nif the manufacturing sector is to play the role that it did in the case of East Asian countries. \nOne point that needs to be noted about our analysis is that it is based on data only on the \norgani\ufffded (or registered) manufacturing sector, and not the unorgani\ufffded sector. This is primarily \nbecause of the unavailability of detailed data for the latter. A question that comes up then is \nwhether the lack of quality data on the unregistered manufacturing should preclude any analysis \nof the registered manufacturing sector. Though there is no denying the fact that the unorgani\ufffded \nmanufacturing sector is important when it comes to employment, its output, wages, and productivity \nare very low. In terms of policy objectives, improving the performance of registered manufacturing \nis a key aspect to making India a powerhouse in manufacturing. \nII. stylIzED FACts AND PRElImINARy EvIDENCE\nA.  Indian Policy Framework\nSince the early 1950s up until the early 1980s, the evolution of India\u2019s manufacturing sector \nwas guided by industrial and trade policies that protected domestic industry and gave the state a \ncentral role in investment decisions. While a strict regime of import and export controls defined \ntrade policy, industrial policy worked through an elaborate system of industrial licensing. Under the \n\u0018  August 2008", "seCtion ii\nstylized fACts And PreliMinAry evidenCe\nIndustries Development and Regulatory Act of 1951, investors needed to obtain a license before \nestablishing an industrial plant, adding a new product line to an existing plant, substantially \nexpanding output, or changing a plant\u2019s location.\nWhile the state-led import substitution policy framework had helped create a diversified \nmanufacturing sector, industrial stagnation since the mid-1960s\u2014increasingly blamed on the \npolicy framework\u2014led to some tentative steps aimed at liberali\ufffding these regimes in the late \n1970s and early 1980s (see Ahluwalia 1987 and 1991). Relaxations of the industrial licensing \nsystem were introduced and import licensing requirements were eased. However, by most accounts \nthese reforms were marginal. Tariff rates as high as 400% were not uncommon, nontariff barriers \nremained widespread, and the industrial licensing regime continued to impose binding constraints \nto entry and growth for most firms. The so-called small-scale sector reservations (introduced in \n1969), which limited the entry and operations of firms above a certain si\ufffde threshold in a number \nof labor-intensive industries continued in full force. (This was largely the case until 2000, and \nrecent reforms have left only \ufffd5 items on the list.)\nMore serious liberali\ufffdation efforts began in 1985 with delicensing\u2014the exemption from the \nrequirement of obtaining an industrial license\u2014of 25 broad categories of industries, which maps \ninto 1\ufffd industries in our \ufffd-digit level data. The next major reform of the licensing regime came in \n1991 when industrial licensing was abolished except in the case of a small number of industries \n(see \ufffdigure 2a and Appendix Table A.4 for the time path of delicensing). This was also the year \nin which a decisive break was made with the trade policies of the past. The liberali\ufffdation of 1991 \nincluded the removal of most licensing and other nontariff barriers on the imports of intermediate \nand capital goods, the simplification of the trade regime, devaluations of the Indian rupee, and \nthe introduction of an explicit dual exchange market in 1992 (see \ufffdigure 2b). \nFIGURE 3\nCUMULATIVE SHARE OF INDUSTRIES DELICENSED\n100\n947\n86 88\n90\nd 80\ne\nens 70\nc\ndeli 60\ns \ne\nstri 50\nu\nnd 40\nof  i 30 27 29\nnt \ne 20\nc\ner\nP 10\n0\n1985 1989 1991 1993 1997\nYear of delicensing\n    Sources: Based on Aghion et al.

One area in which there has been no major policy change is in the labor regulations \nthat apply to India\u2019s industry sector. According to Panagariya (2008), it is rigidities introduced by \nthese (unchanged) regulations that are holding back the manufacturing sector in general and its \nlabor-intensive subsectors in particular. Since the issue of India\u2019s labor regulations is one of the \nmost contentious ones in the context of debates on economic reforms, some details are in order.\nWhile India\u2019s labor regulations have been critici\ufffded on many accounts including, for example, \nthe sheer si\ufffde and scope of regulations, their complexity, and inconsistencies across individual pieces \nof regulation, a few specific pieces of legislation are the controversial ones. \ufffdirst, as per Chapter \n\ufffdB of the IDA it is necessary for firms employing more than 100 workers to obtain the permission \nof state governments in order to retrench or lay off workers.6 While the IDA does not prohibit \nretrenchments, critics of the act argue that it is difficult to carry them out. Datta-Chaudhuri (1996) \nhas argued, for example, that states have often been unwilling to grant permission to retrench.\nSecond, additional rigidities in using effectively a firm\u2019s existing workers are believed to stem \nfrom Section 9A of the IDA and the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act\u2014which pertain to \nprocedures that must be followed by employers before changing the terms and conditions of work. \nWhile the two pieces of legislation seek to make labor contracts complete, fair, and legally binding, \nthey can constrain firms from making quick adjustments to changing conditions. In particular, worker \nconsent is required in order to modify job descriptions or move workers from one plant to another in \n6 Until 1976, the provisions of the IDA on retrenchments or layoffs were fairly uncontroversial. The IDA allowed firms \nto lay off or retrench workers as per economic circumstances as long as certain requirements such as the provision \nof sufficient notice, severance payments, and the order of retrenchment among workers (last in first out) were met. \nAn amendment in 1976 (the introduction of Chapter \ufffdB), however, made it compulsory for employers with more than \n\ufffd00 workers to seek the prior approval of the appropriate government before workers could be dismissed. A further \namendment in 1982 widened the scope of this regulation by making it applicable to employers with 100 workers or \nmore. \n\u0018  August 2008", "seCtion ii\nstylized fACts And PreliMinAry evidenCe\nresponse to changing market conditions. In and of itself, this does not seem to be an unreasonable \nobjective. The problem, according to some analysts, is that the workings of India\u2019s Trade Union \nAct (TUA) make it difficult to obtain worker consent. While the TUA allows any seven workers in \nan enterprise to form and register a trade union, it has no provisions for union recognition (for \nexample, via a secret ballot). The result, according to Anant (2000), has been multiple and rival \nunions, making it difficult to arrive at a consensus among workers.\nSimilarly, hiring contract workers can enable firms to get around many of the regulatory \nrestrictions on adjusting employment levels, productions tasks, and others; however, it is argued that \nSection 10 of the Contract Labour Act, which empowers the government to prohibit the employment \nof contract labor in any industry, operation, or process, limits this course of action.\nIt is important to note that not all analysts agree that India\u2019s labor laws have made for a rigid \nlabor market. In particular, a counter argument to the views above is that the rigidity-inducing \nregulations have been either ignored (see Nagaraj 2002) or circumvented through the increased \nusage of temporary or contract labor (see Dutta 200\ufffd and Ramaswamy 200\ufffd).7 Ultimately, whether \nIndia\u2019s labor laws have created significant rigidities in labor markets or not is an empirical issue, \nas is the broader question of whether and to what extent various policies have been the main \nconstraints on the growth of Indian manufacturing. \nAnother well-known constraint on growth is India\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. According to the \nDeputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, India needs to increase its \ninvestment in infrastructure from 5% of GDP to 8% of GDP by the end of the Eleventh \ufffdive-Year \nPlan, yielding an investment of $400 billion in its infrastructure to sustain the current growth \nrates. One does not need any scientific evidence to show that infrastructure in India needs to be \nimproved, as the erratic and costly electricity supply, congested roads, ports, and airports are for \nall to witness. A recent survey of the Indian economy compares Indian infrastructure with that of \nother countries and finds India to be badly lagging in most of the areas (OECD 2007).\nAn interesting comparison in this regard is with the infrastructure in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC). Total investment anticipated in infrastructure in the Tenth \ufffdive-Year Plan (2002\u20132006) \nin India was 5% compared to the PRC\u2019s 12.6% in 2005 (\ufffdigure \ufffd). Not only is the PRC\u2019s investment \nas a share of GDP almost 2.5% times greater than that of India, the PRC\u2019s GDP base is larger as \nwell. In almost all sectors, investment as a share of GDP in the PRC is far greater than those in \nIndia (\ufffdigure \ufffd).\n7 \ufffdor a detailed review of Indian labor regulations and the debate surrounding the issue of rigidity, see Anant et al. \n(2006).\n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  \u0018", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\nFIGURE 5\nINFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT, THE PRC AND INDIA\n12.6\n5.04 Total\n3.6\n1.72 Power and gas\n4.6\n1.60 Transport\n3.3\n0.71 Irrigation\n0.8 Telecommunications\n0.64\n0.3\n0.37Drinking water\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\nShare in GDP (percent)\nIndia, 10th Five Year Plan PRC, 2005\n    Sources: Authors\u2019 calculation, Planning Commission (2007), Lall et al.

Reform efforts in this area have been directed at deregulating \ninterest rates, some dilution of public ownership of banks, and limited opening up of the sector to \nprivate domestic and foreign banks. However as pointed out often, and most recently in the OECD \nEconomic Survey on India (OECD 2007), some major challenges still remain. These include a very \nhigh share of public ownership in banks and a low level of bank intermediation partly because of \nregulations on the allocation of credit that require banks to allocate a substantial percentage of \ntheir total advances into government securities and other priority sectors.8  \nb.

EvIDENCE FRom ENtERPRIsE suRvEys\nWhat lies behind this relatively lackluster performance?  Before turning to the main econometric \nanalysis of this paper, it is useful to examine the views of managers based on two recent surveys \nof manufacturing firms: the Investment Climate Survey conducted by the World Bank and a survey \nof about 250 firms from some of the most labor intensive sectors, conducted by ICRIER.12\nThe World Bank\u2019s investment climate survey (ICS) data consists of the responses of managers to \na wide range of questions including those pertaining to their perception on how various regulatory \nand other factors influence their firms. A key question asks about the extent to which various \nfactors are considered \u201ca problem for the operation and growth\u201d of the surveyed firm\u2019s business. \n\ufffdor each factor listed, respondents can reply in terms of a five-point scale: 0=no obstacle; 1=minor \nobstacle; 2=moderate obstacle; \ufffd=major obstacle; 4=very severe obstacle.1\ufffd The scale enables one \nto compare firms\u2019 responses about various factors (ranging from regulatory and governance issues \nto infrastructure-related concerns) in terms of how they influence firms\u2019 operations or growth \nprospects. \n\ufffdigure 5 depicts the fraction of firms describing a given factor as a major or very severe obstacle \nin the 2005 ICS survey (similar patterns are observed in the 2002 ICS survey). Tax-related issues, \nincorporating difficulties with either the tax administration system or complaints about tax rates, \nare considered to be a major or severe constraint by more than 40% of respondents. Of course, it is \nnot easy to interpret this finding given what is probably a natural penchant among firms to want to \npay as little as possible in taxes. Ignoring tax-related issues then, the situation with infrastructure \ncan be seen to be a critical obstacle for operations and growth from the perspective of the firms.14  \nAlmost 40% of respondents cite it as a major or severe obstacle. In addition to infrastructure, one \nfifth or more of the respondents cite governance issues (which include concerns with corruption) \nand the cost and access to finance as the major obstacles. Surprisingly, an almost equal percent of \nrespondents cite skills and labor regulations as major obstacles (around 15%). \n12 The survey, \u201cHow to Enhance Employment Generation and Exports of Labour Intensive \ufffdirms\u201d, was conducted by a team \nled by Deb Kusum Das. We thank him for sharing the data with us. \n1\ufffd We are aware that the phrasing of this question may not be ideal since it lumps together operations and growth. It \nis quite possible, for example, that some aspect of industrial regulations may not be a problem for the operations of \na firm, unless the firm tried to expand its operations.\n14 Infrastructure includes electricity, telecommunications, and transportation. Disaggregating this variable shows that \nthe concern with infrastructure is overwhelmingly driven by concerns with electricity. Telecommunications are hardly \nconsidered a problem.\n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  11", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\nFIGURE 7\nOBSTACLES FOR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH\n(ALL FIRMS, 2005)\nTax issues\nInfrastructure\nGovernance\nFinance\nRegulations\nSkills\nLabor regulations\nMacro policy and uncertainty\nLand\nAnticompetitive practice\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\nMean of obstacle\n  Note:   \ufffdraction reporting issue as \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cvery severe\u201d obstacle.\n  Source:   Authors\u2019 estimates based on World Bank-CII survey data.\nA useful follow-up question entailed asking firms what constituted the single most important \nobstacle for their operation and growth.

It is useful to examine the results of this survey because \nit covers firms from some of the most labor-intensive manufacturing activities. Thus to the extent \nthat labor regulations create serious constraints and growth prospects of firms, the sample firms \nshould be among those most affected.15 \nBroadly speaking, the respondents find electricity and infrastructure in general; financing; \nand skilled labor availability to be the most serious constraints on growth. Just like in the ICS \n15 Not all the firms covered responded to all the questions in the survey. \ufffdor the purposes of the present study, we focus \non the responses relating to the questions on the hurdles to the growth of the firms.\n1\u0018  August 2008", "seCtion iii\nevidenCe froM enterPrise surveys\nsurvey, they also point to specific regulations especially those related to taxes (and fiscal benefits, \nin general) among things that can be improved.16 The chart below summari\ufffdes the responses of \nthe firms.17\nFIGURE 8\nAREAS OF IMPROVEMENT (PERCENT)\nTraining facility\nCredit 10\n5\nFiscal benefits\nInfrastructure\n52\n33\nSource:  Authors\u2019 calculation using data from (ICRIER 2007).\nIn response to the questions on hurdles to increasing employment, a majority of the respondents \nreported shortage of labor (of mostly skilled and semi-skilled labor) as the key hurdle to hiring \nmore labor.18 \ufffdurther, most of the firms (approximately 90%) responded in the negative to being \naffected by any labor disputes or to having labor unions in their organi\ufffdation and/or any impact \nof the unions on their activities. \nTaken together, there are some striking similarities in the results of these two very different \nsurveys. \ufffdirst, infrastructure-related issues are very high on the list of constraints faced by firms. \nIndeed, ignoring tax-related issues, concerns with electricity seem to be paramount. Second, \nfinance-related issues also seem be a problem, especially for the smaller firms. Third, surprisingly, \nlabor regulations do not show up as a significant concern for firms. Indeed, both surveys suggest \nthat concerns with skills-related issues are more important than those having to do with labor \nregulations.\n16  A look at the specific responses makes it clear that the concern with fiscal issues is very narrowly defined and is more \nin the nature of a personal issue to the firms, to the extent that taxes directly affect their bottom lines. In response \nto the question, \u201cwhat would you like to see changed to help you?\u201d, majority answered that they would like taxes to \nbe lowered or subsidies received from the government. \n17 The survey also tried to find whether the technological changes are such that they are inhibiting employment growth. \nAbout two thirds of the respondents acknowledged technological changes (either a lot or modest) taking place globally \nin their industry. Of those answering affirmatively to worldwide changes in technology in their respective industries, \n70% of the respondents adopted new technology during the 5 years prior to the year of the survey; however, majority \nof them still find a gap between the technologies they used and those used globally. In general, however, there is \nno clear evidence on the impact of adoption of new technologies on labor. One potential explanation for the lack of \na clear pattern could be that while adoption of new technology, on one hand, might be labor-saving (substitution \neffect), on the other hand, growth resulting from adopting new technology might be expansionary and could lead to \nhiring of more labor (growth effect).\n18 Interestingly, approximately 10% of the firms rue the lack of training facilities. This is consistent with shortage of \nlabor or, more precisely, the shortage of the \u201cright\u201d kind of labor for the \u201cright\u201d kind of skills.\n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  1\u0018", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\nWhile the concerns with electricity are not surprising for anyone with some familiarity with \nthe Indian industrial scene, the low ranking of labor regulations as obstacles for operations and \ngrowth is surprising. One interpretation of these results could be that labor regulations may not \nmatter much to firms in practice. This could happen, for example, if noncompliance with labor \nregulations is not costly. Alternatively, firms may be able to \u201cget around\u201d restrictions on layoffs by \nhiring contract workers. A second interpretation of these results, however, is that labor regulations \nmay not matter that much to incumbent firms. But it may matter to a nonincumbent investor \ncontemplating entry into the manufacturing sector.\nMore generally, an investor\u2019s choice on which specific sectors (for example, services versus \nmanufacturing) and subsectors (for example, a more labor-intensive manufacturing industry versus \na less labor-intensive one) to enter, as well as the production technologies, scale, and desired \nlevels of employment to adopt, can be expected to be influenced by the regulatory framework. \nIn this way, there may be an \u201cex-ante\u201d effect of the law that would be very difficult to capture \nthrough the surveys of incumbent manufactures. In other words, deterred by specific elements of \nlabor regulations such as Chapter \ufffdB of the IDA, potential investors, especially those contemplating \nlarge investments, choose to avoid investing in manufacturing altogether, or if they do invest in \nmanufacturing, they avoid subsectors, product lines, or scales of production for which the regulations \nhave most bite.\nIn what follows, we turn to an approach that has the potential for getting around the \n\u201cselection\u201d problem inherent in surveys of incumbent firms. In particular, we use industry-level \ndata from India\u2019s organi\ufffded manufacturing sector to examine the relative performance of industries \nwith various characteristics. \nIv. ECoNomEtRIC ANAlysIs\nWe are interested in testing the variants of the following hypotheses: did industries that are \nmore labor-intensive; or industries that rely more on infrastructure; or industries that rely more on \nthe financial sector for their financing needs, grow less than the control group of industries in the \npost-delicensing period? The econometric methodology is derived from Rajan and Zingales (1998), \nwho analy\ufffde the effect of financial development on growth by comparing the growth of industries \ndepending more on the financial sector that are in countries with greater financial depth, with \nthe growth of these industries in countries with shallower financial markets. Thus if the financial \nsector indeed matters for growth, then one would see higher growth in industries that rely on the \nfinancial sector in countries with a deeper financial sector, and vice versa. This technique gets \nto the causality issue much more cleverly than the alternative econometric ways to measure this \nrelationship. The methodology has subsequently been used in several different contexts (see, e.g., \nDell\u2019Ariccia et al. 2005, Rajan and Subramanian 2005). \nWe use this technique to look at the constraints that Indian industry might have experienced \npost-delicensing. Hence we analy\ufffde the performance of the industries that rely more heavily on \ninfrastructure, industries that depend on the financial sector, and the labor-intensive industries \npost-delicensing. An evidence of lackluster growth in these industries is attributed then to the \nunavailability of inputs or factors that the respective industries rely more heavily on. Thus if the \ninfrastructure-dependent industries have not performed well post-delicensing, then it is likely to \nbe due to the fact that the infrastructure availability has not been adequate for these industries \nto tap the maximum benefit from the reforms. \n1\u0018  August 2008", "seCtion iv\neConoMetriC AnAlysis\nA.  Construction of variables\n  1.  Reform variables\nAs discussed in Section II, industrial and trade policy has seen wide-ranging reforms over the \nperiod under study. While limited reforms were started from the mid-1980s onward, major policy \nchanges were undertaken following the crisis in 1991. Some of the reforms introduced were more \ngeneric and aimed at macroeconomic management; others were more specific to the industries. The \nreforms spanned several areas, including delicensing of industries, trade reforms, and exchange rate \nreforms. In subsequent years these were complemented by the liberali\ufffdation of foreign investment\u2014\nboth foreign direct investment (\ufffdDI) and portfolio; dereservation of industrial sectors under small \nscale; financial sector liberali\ufffdation; and privati\ufffdation of public sector units. \nIn our econometric exercise we look at the effect of delicensing on Indian manufacturing \nindustries, which is one of the most comprehensive programs that covered almost all the industries. \nThe fact that these reforms were undertaken at different points in time allows us to include time \nfixed effects to account for unobservable but common macroeconomic shocks in the regressions. We \ndo not have complete data for trade reforms, but we control for it in the robustness exercises.19 In \nrobustness tests we also estimate a specification in which we include the interaction of industry \ncharacteristics with a post-1992 dummy in the benchmark specification to account for the reforms \nthat were more generic in nature, besides the delicensing. Results remain broadly unchanged and \nare presented selectively here. \n  \u0018.  Industrial Characteristics\nNext we define three industrial characteristics of various industries: labor intensity, dependence \nof industries on external finance, and infrastructure dependence. Rajan and Zingales (1998) assume \nthat there are probably technological reasons why some industries depend more on external finance \nthan others. We extend this reasoning to labor intensity and infrastructure intensity. To the extent \nthat these two characteristics define input usage, the technological requirement assumption is \nperhaps as valid as for defining external financing dependence. We briefly describe the various \nindustrial characteristics below, and further details are provided in the appendices.\n  \u0018.  labor Intensity\nLabor intensity is the ratio of total employment to capital stock. Since there are no comprehensive \ndatabases of employment at the firm level, we use the ASI industry-level data to calculate this \nratio. \n  \u0018.  Dependence on External Finance\nWe calculate the external financial dependence of firms in two different ways using two different \ndatabases: the first one uses firm-level data from the Prowess database published by the Center for \nMonitoring Indian Economy and employs the same definition as used by Rajan and Zingales (1998). \n19 See Mitra and Ural (2007), Kumar and Mishra (2008), and Topalova (2005) for analyses on effects of trade \nliberali\ufffdation. \n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  1\u0018", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\nThe second measure is calculated using the ASI data as the ratio of outstanding loans to invested \ncapital. The index of external finance dependence does not correlate well across two databases and \nacross different definitions. Neither of these correlates too well with the index calculated by Rajan \nand Zingales (1998), which was calculated for industrial data at 2-digit level for US industries. To \nthe extent that our firm-level data (from Prowess) is only for listed firms whose access to financial \nmarkets is likely to be different from that of small and medium enterprises, possibly affecting the \ncross industry ranking, we use the financial dependence indicator calculated using ASI data. \n  \u0018.  Infrastructure Dependence of Industries \nThis is the ratio of expenses on distribution (i.e., storage and transportation) and power and \nfuel to gross value-added using firm-level data. To the extent that we have data on expenses on fuel \nconsumption in both CMIE and ASI, we calculate an indicator just as the ratio of fuel expenditure \nto gross value-added. These are highly correlated across the two databases, and with the indicator \nthat includes distribution expenses as well. Appendix B1 indicates which industries are below or \nabove the median for each of these characteristics.\nIn order to get around the concern that these characteristics would reflect the equilibrium \nconditions between the demand and supply of the respective inputs, we use the data from an \nearlier year (in general we use averages over the early 1990s, but where data are available we \nconfirmed that the industry characteristics are correlated highly with the ones calculated using \ndata for earlier periods) rather than contemporaneous data. \ufffdurthermore, to smooth out the noise \nin the data, we use 5-year averages of the relevant variables to calculate the industry indicators. \nWe also confirmed, where possible, that the relative industry rankings across various characteristics \ndo not change over time. This robustness check gives credence to the belief that there are perhaps \nexternal technological reasons for why an industry uses more external finance; or uses more labor \nthan capital; or depends more on infrastructure; and to the fact that using data from the early \n1990s is legitimate. \nThe questions that come to mind about these industry features are, are these capturing some \nother features of the industries; and, how are the three features correlated with each other? Appendix \nTable B2 reports correlations among these characteristics and some of the other features of the \nindustries that we could calculate. As we can see from this appendix table, the various industry \ncharacteristics are not correlated significantly with each other. The exceptions include labor-intensive \nindustries being negatively correlated with imports and financial dependence; and infrastructure \ndependence being negatively correlated with import and \ufffdDI intensity. Labor-intensive industries \nare also somewhat more export-intensive. \nb.  Empirical Results from the AsI Data\nWe begin by exploring the possibility that the overall performance of the manufacturing sector \nmasks significant interindustry heterogeneity. Are there certain industries that have not benefited \nas much from the reforms? \nIn Table \ufffd below we find that performance varies across different sectors. In particular, we \nidentify industries that depend more on infrastructure, industries that depend more on the financial \nsector for their financing needs, and labor-intensive industries (see Appendix B1). We divide the \nindustries into those belonging to above or at median values for each industry characteristic, and \n1\u0018  August 2008", "seCtion iv\neConoMetriC AnAlysis\nestimate separate regressions for industries below and above median values.

The industry characteristics are defined in Section \nIII and Appendix B. The dependent variable used is value-added in log. Robust t statistics are given in brackets. \nResults in Table \ufffd show that the industries that are more infrastructure-intensive, on average, \nexperience 15% lower growth  in value-added post-delicensing (i.e., in the delicensed period relative \nto the earlier period), as compared to \ufffd\ufffd% higher output growth in value-added of industries that \nare less reliant on infrastructure. Similarly the industries more dependent on the financial sector, \ni.e., the labor-intensive industries, have fared much worse than the industries that do not rely \nas much on the financial sector and are less labor-intensive. Thus, there seems to be significant \nheterogeneity in the performance of Indian manufacturing across industry groups.\nC.  Econometric Framework\nWe use the following econometric specification to analy\ufffde the impact of delicensing on various \nperformance indicators:\nY =  \u03a3\u03b1 d + \u03a3\u03b2  d + \u03b3 (delicensing dummy ) + \nit  i  i t t it \n\u03b4 (characteristic of industry i * delicensing dummy ) + \u03b5 (1)\nit it                                 \nwhere Y  is the outcome variable measured in log. As before, we consider gross value-added at \nit \nconstant prices, employment, capital stock, and number of factories as the outcome variables. \nIn equation 1, ds is industry-specific dummy and \u03b1s is the respective coefficient; Is  is year-\ni i t\nspecific dummy, and \u03b2  is the respective coefficient. The fixed effects account for the industry-specific \nt\n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  1\u0018", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\nomitted variables; and the year-fixed effects control for year-specific shocks that are common to all \nindustries. Since we are using industry fixed effects and year-fixed effects in the regression equation, \nthe only additional variables we can include are the ones that vary with both industry and year. \nThe next term in equation 1 is the delicensing dummy, which varies over time and industry. The \ndummy takes a value 1 from the year when the delicensing requirement for a particular industry \nwas removed, and remains 1 for the rest of the sample period.20 \nWe are interested in testing the variants of the following hypotheses: did industries that are \nmore labor-intensive (or industries that rely more on infrastructure or the financial sector for their \nfinancing needs) grow less than the control group of industries in the post-delicensing period? \nTesting for these hypotheses requires us to set up the regression equation for difference in differences \nestimates. Continuing with the specific hypothesis involving labor-intensive industries, consider the \nfollowing possible cases for any given outcome variable: \noutCoMe variable in  outCoMe variable in \nPre-reforM Period PostreforM Period\nMore labor-intensive (treatment group) \u0398 \u0398\nL,Pre L,Post\nLess labor-intensive (control group) \u0398 \u0398\nC,Pre C,Post\nEssentially, we would like to test the hypothesis that (\u0398 - \u0398 )-(\u0398  \u0398 ) is \nL,Post L,Pre C,Post- C,Pre\nsignificantly different from \ufffdero. The coefficient \u03b4 in equation 1 allows us to do this. In the \nregression equations, we use the interaction of each of the industry characteristics with delicensing \nseparately and together. \nHow do we interpret a negative and significant coefficient for the interaction term of a particular \nindustry characteristic, say, infrastructure-dependent industries? The coefficient indicates that the \nindustries that use infrastructure more intensively have grown less post-delicensing, compared \nto the industries that use infrastructure less intensively. Can this be interpreted as a causal \nrelationship between the lack of infrastructure and performance? As mentioned in the introduction, \nto the extent that an industry characteristic is exogenous of performance, e.g., it is some sort of \na technical requirement; or if we can control for potential omitted variables, then we can probably \nclaim causality in this result.\n\ufffdor exogeneity in our industry characteristics we use the data from the earliest possible period \nfor which we have the data (in our case, the early 1990s). We control for omitted variables varying \nonly over industries and over years by including the respective fixed effects. To rule out other \npotential omitted variables we conduct extensive robustness tests to be described later. \nIn Table 4 we present our results for the benchmark case as given by equation (1). Coefficients \non both the industry and year-fixed effects have been suppressed from the table. In the results in \ncolumn 1, the coefficient for delicensing shows a 12% increase in value-added per industry post-\ndelicensing. Given that the average delicensing period is about 15 years, it amounts to a less than \na 1% increase in value-added per year in the post-delicensing period. However as shown in Table \n\ufffd, certain industries did not fare as well during the post-delicensing period. Thus when we control \nfor the different effects on these industries separately, the post-delicensing impact on growth of \nthe control group improves substantially. \n20 The delicensing dummy is based on the information provided in Aghion et al.

As expected, the performance of the control group goes up considerably. The industries \nmore dependent on infrastructure, labor, and external finance, respectively, have witnessed slower \ngrowth as opposed to their respective control group. In column 5 we include them together, and we \nfind that industries ranking higher on each of our three industry characteristics have faired poorly \nin the post-delicensing period. \ufffdinally, the last column is the same as column 5 except that in this \ncolumn, instead of including the index of industry characteristics, we divide them into above median \nand below median groups. We also include the interaction of the dummy variables, which takes the \nvalue 1 when an industry is above the median of the respective characteristic with delicensing. \nOnce again we find that the results hold and industries above the median in each of the three \ncharacteristics have not done as well as the control group in the post-delicensing period.\ntable 4\nvalue-added Post-deliCensing\n(1) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018)\nDelicensing 0.12** 0.18*** 0.26*** 0.5\ufffd*** 0.9\ufffd*** 0.\ufffd6***\n[2.50] [\ufffd.10] [\ufffd.\ufffd1] [4.65] [7.\ufffd5] [5.61]\nInfrastructure dep* delicensing -0.17** -\n0.18***\n[2.42] [2.59]\nLabor intensity*delicensing -0.\ufffd0** -\n0.51***\n[2.02] [\ufffd.55]\nExternal finance dep*delicensing - -\n0.9\ufffd*** 1.22***\n[4.01] [5.49]\nInfrastructure dummy*delicensing -0.10*\n[1.88]\nLabor intensity dummy*delicensing -0.19***\n[4.07]\nExternal finance dummy* -0.18***\nDelicensing [\ufffd.40]\nIndustry fixed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nYear fixed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nObservations 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61\nNumber of industries 44 44 44 44 44 44\nR-squared 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.71 0.71\n* significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.\nNote:  Dependent variable is log value-added.

The issues related to employment are manifold \nand much more complex, and all of these probably cannot be addressed in this paper. Some of the \nissues that merit attention include: why has growth not been employment-intensive; is technology \ndisplacing labor; how has the employment of unskilled versus skilled workers evolved over time; \nhow is the skill premium changing over time etc. \ufffdor brevity we look only at total employment \nhere, which includes manual workers, supervisors, and regular as well as contract employees. \nWe look at two econometric specifications here. The first is the estimates from equation 1, \nresults of which are reported in Table 6a and 7a, respectively, for employment and capital stock. \n\ufffdrom column 1 of Table 6a, employment has increased by a mere 7% over the entire delicensing \nperiod. With the average delicensing period about 15 years, this translates into a less than 0.5% \nincrease in employment per year post-product market reforms. \n\u00180  August 2008", "seCtion iv\neConoMetriC AnAlysis\nAs expected, once we introduce heterogeneity based on industry characteristics, the performance \nof the control group improves rather substantially (columns 2\u20135). The maximum increase is in the \ncase of the industries less dependent on external finance. Notably, infrastructure-dependent and \nexternal finance-dependent industries, as well as labor-intensive industries, are the weakest performers \nin so far as employment generation in the post-delicensing period is concerned. \nIn addition, we estimate the following regression equation: \nE =  \u03a3\u03b1 d + \u03a3\u03b2  d + \u03b8Y + \u03c0Y  x delicensing dummy\nit  i  i t t it  it  it\n\u03bb (Y x *characteristic of industry i * delicensing dummy ) + \u03b5 (2)\nit  it it  \nIn equation 2, E refers to log of employment (or log of invested capital in real terms), d is \nit   i\nindustry-specific dummy, and d   is year-specific dummies. We also include log of gross value-added \nt\nin the equation; the coefficient \u03b8 can be interpreted as the employment elasticity of output. It \nmeasures the percentage change in employment for a 1% increase in output. The next term is the \ninteraction of delicensing dummy with Y Its coefficient \u03c0 gives the employment elasticity of output \nit. \npost-delicensing. \ufffdinally, we include the interaction of Y , delicensing, and industry characteristics. \nit\nThe coefficient \u03bb measures the employment elasticity of output for the industry characteristic used \nin the interaction with post-delicensing. Thus if we are including labor intensity in the interaction \nterm in equation (2), then it measures the change in the elasticity of employment post-delicensing \nin labor-intensive industries. If it is positive, it implies that the employment elasticity in labor-\nintensive industries has increased post-delicensing and so on.\nResults on employment from specification 2 are in Table 6b. The results indicate that the \nemployment elasticity of output is about 50% on average, though there are differences across \nindustries. The elasticity is higher for labor-intensive industries than for infrastructure-dependent \nor for financially dependent industries. Results also indicate that there has been no change in the \nelasticity of employment post-delicensing, this is true on average for all industries, including for \nthe industry characteristics that we control for explicitly in our regressions. \nThese results have two implications: first, if growth were to accelerate in Indian manufacturing \nit would probably generate employment at the same rate as before; second, in order to generate \nmore employment in Indian manufacturing it is imperative that the labor-intensive sectors grow \nfaster. As we mentioned earlier, aggregate employment masks several nuances related to different \nkinds of employment, but we do not have space to discuss them all here. \n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  \u00181", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\ntable 6a\neMPloyMent Post-deliCensing\u2014results froM equation 1\n(1) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018)\nDelicensing 0.07** 0.15*** 0.11* 0.\ufffd6*** 0.59***\n[2.47] [4.\ufffd7] [1.92] [\ufffd.95] [7.0\ufffd]\nInfrastructure dep* delicensing -0.25*** -0.25***\n[5.69] [6.12]\nLabor intensity*delicensing -0.075 -0.22**\n[0.64] [2.05]\nExternal finance dep*delicensing -0.67*** -0.78***\n[\ufffd.48] [4.62]\nIndustry fixed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nYear fixed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nObservations 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61\nNumber of industries 44 44 44 44 44\nR-squared 0.\ufffd5 0.\ufffd6 0.\ufffd5 0.\ufffd6 0.\ufffd7\n* significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.\nNote: Dependent variable is log Employment.

Robust t statistics in brackets. \nD.   Robustness of Results \nWe do extensive tests for the robustness of our results. These include checking the robustness \nto different time periods, omitted variables, and potential outliers. We account for the lags between \npolicy and implementation; we also account for the possibility that the outcomes might be correlated \nby the industries or by the year of delicensing. While we do obtain small variations in coefficients \nand in the standard errors across these different specifications, overall, the results are quite robust \nto various sensitivity tests. One result that does seem a bit sensitive to some of the corrections \nfor autocorrelation is the result on infrastructure dependence. In some of the corrections for \nautocorrelations, the coefficients of the interaction between infrastructure and delicensing become \nless significant, but even here its effect holds at about the 20% level of significance. Details on \neach robustness test follow. \nThough in the methodology used here the omitted variables that vary only by industry or by \nyear have been accounted for through the respective fixed effects, the estimates remain susceptible \nto the omission of variables that vary over industry\u2013year dimensions of the data. In particular, \nthere might have been the following two types of omissions: first, the interaction of delicensing \n\u0018\u0018  August 2008", "seCtion iv\neConoMetriC AnAlysis\nwith industry characteristics other than the ones included; and second, the interaction of policy \nvariables other than delicensing and their interactions with the industry characteristics included. \nWe explicitly control for only one of the major policy changes pertaining to Indian industries\u2014\ndelicensing. What about the other policy changes? In order to address these concerns we carry out \ntwo robustness tests. \ufffdirst, to control for the reforms that were more generic rather than specific \nto industries, we include in our regressions interaction of industrial characteristics with a post-1992 \ndummy. Second, we construct a trade policy measure that is industry-specific and interact it with \nindustrial characteristics. Results that infrastructure-dependent, external finance-dependent, and \nlabor-intensive industries have not benefited as much from reforms are fairly robust across these \nvarious specifications. \nWhile we are unable to conduct these tests for some of the other reforms, the results are \nunlikely to change. The reason is that the reforms are highly correlated over time and across sectors. \nThus even if we get a somewhat different coefficient when we include interaction of industry \ncharacteristics with different reforms instead of delicensing, the basic message we want to bring \nhome\u2014that without sufficient infrastructure development, financial depth, and progress on factors \ninhibiting labor-intensive industries, Indian industry is unlikely to reali\ufffde its potential\u2014would hold. \n\ufffdor this argument it is really immaterial what kind of reforms we are talking about. Second, if we \ninclude the interactions of industry characteristics with different reform measures, e.g., delicensing \nand trade reforms, in the same specification, then the coefficient for a particular policy measure \nwould become weaker and probably even lose its statistical significance. Such a specification will be \nof little use since again the interest is in a composite reform measure rather than specific reform \nmeasures. Thus, even if the coefficients might be biased in the benchmark specification, to the \nextent that we do not really care about attributing it to delicensing per se, we are fine. \ufffdor omitted \nindustry characteristics we include other industrial characteristics in the regressions, such as export \nintensity or \ufffdDI intensity interacted with delicensing, and find the results to be robust. \nWe report results for some of the robustness tests in Table 7. The reported results are for the \ndependent variable log value-added. In order to address the concerns related to autocorrelation \nwe reduce the sample length to the period from 1980 onward (see column 1). We can restrict the \nperiod further but then we would start losing our control period. In the results reported in column \n2 we calculate the standard errors corrected for Newey West adjustment. \n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  \u0018\u0018", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\ntable 7\nrobustness tests\n(1) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018) (\u0018)\n1980s Without  trade and deliCens-\nand tobaCCo,  trade reforM  deliCens- ing lagged  Cluster\nbeyond neWey2 PetroleuM ing tWo years ses \nDelicensing 0.71*** 0.9*** 1.1*** 0.62*** 0.95*** 0.9\ufffd**\n[4.69] [5.12] [8.41] [\ufffd.18] [7.80] [2.86]\nTrade openness 1.04*** 0.72***\n[6.\ufffd\ufffd] [\ufffd.46]\nInfrastructure*  -0.22** -0.18* -0.18*** 0.0\ufffd -0.2\ufffd*** -0.18\nDelicensing\n[2.57] [1.8\ufffd] [2.62] [0.29] [\ufffd.4\ufffd] [1.\ufffd7]\nLabor  -0.45*** -0.51** -0.60*** -0.\ufffd0* -0.50*** -0.51***\nintensity*\nDelicensing\n[2.97] [2.\ufffd2] [4.08] [1.94] [\ufffd.\ufffd8] [4.26]\nExternal finance* -0.94*** -1.2*** -1.\ufffd7*** -1.09*** -1.11*** -1.22\nDelicensing\n[\ufffd.52] [\ufffd.80] [6.21] [2.88] [4.97] [1.57]\nInfrastructure* -0.41*** -0.45***\nTrade openness\n[5.26] [5.01]\nLabor intensity* -0.05 0.0\ufffd\nTrade openness\n[0.97] [0.55]\n\ufffdinancial dep* -0.52** 0.1\ufffd\nTrade openness\n[2.01] [0.\ufffd6]\nIndustry fixed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nTime fixed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nObservations 1056 1\ufffd61 1299 1056 1056 1\ufffd61 1\ufffd61\nNumber of industries 44 44 42 44 44 44 44\nR-squared 0.67 0.71 0.68 0.69 0.71 0.71\n* significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.\nNote: Dependent variable is log value-added.

CoNCluDINg REmARks\nIn this paper, we have analy\ufffded the performance of the registered Indian manufacturing \nsector in India using data from the ASI. In line with some recent studies, we find that industrial \nperformance has improved with industrial delicensing. However, our analysis also indicates that \nthere is considerable heterogeneity in the response of industries to policy reforms. In particular, \nthe industries more dependent on infrastructure; industries with greater dependence on sources of \nfinance external to the firms; as well as those with high labor intensity have not performed well. \n\ufffdrom a policy perspective, the important question then is what features of India\u2019s policy and \ninstitutional landscape explain this pattern?  The ongoing policy debates in India suggest several \nleading candidates. In the case of infrastructure-dependent industries, the inadequacy of public \nprovision of infrastructure is probably the main culprit. Similarly, the failure to improve the Indian \nfinancial sector\u2019s ability to identify and finance creditworthy firms and investors may well lie behind \nthe relatively weak performance of industries especially dependent on external finance. \nA complementary analysis of two firm-level surveys of managers in the manufacturing sector \nlends further support to these arguments, especially in the case of infrastructure and finance. Taken \ntogether, the results of the World Bank\u2019s investment climate survey and ICRIER survey of labor-\nintensive manufactures support the notion that weak provision of infrastructure and finance has \nconstrained the growth of the manufacturing sector.\nAs regards the weak performance of labor-intensive industries, certain elements of Indian \nlabor regulation may well be an important causal factor as argued by a number of observers of \nthe Indian economy. In particular, certain elements of the IDA may have raised significantly the \neffective cost of hiring workers, thereby hitting the relative profitability of labor-intensive industries \ndisproportionately. Since this is more likely to be the case for larger firms (due to the nature of \nthe regulations), labor regulations may have led to relatively weaker performance of labor-intensive \nindustries in two ways: first, by discouraging entry by large firms; and second, by reducing incentives \namong small firms to expand.\nHowever, other factors cannot be ruled out\u2014such as the policy of reserving a whole range of \nlabor-intensive products for production by small-scale firms as recently as 2001. One way to make \nheadway on this issue, i.e., establishing whether certain elements of the policy or institutional \nframework are causal drivers of the pattern of industrial performance\u2014is to extend our analysis \nto the state level. To the extent that India\u2019s states present sufficient variability in the provision \nof infrastructure and finance, and given the stance of labor regulations (as they actually apply to \nfirms and not just on paper), carrying out this analysis at the state level should be very useful. \nWe take up this issue in our forthcoming work.\nIn the meantime, our econometric analysis has served to highlight from where the relatively \nweaker performance in India\u2019s manufacturing sector is coming. Unlike previous work that has highlighted \nmainly the role of labor regulations in influencing industrial performance, our econometric results \ninterpreted in conjunction with perception of managers suggest that steps to improve infrastructure \nand the financial system should go a long way in improving manufacturing performance. Additionally, \nour results also point to the urgency of identifying the constraints on labor-intensive manufacturing \nin India and relaxing these.\n  erd WorKing PAPer series no. 119  \u0018\u0018", "WhAt ConstrAins indiAn MAnufACturing?\nPoonAM guPtA, rAnA hAsAn, And utsAv KuMAr\nAPPENDIx A \nDAtA souRCEs AND CoNstRuCtIoN oF vARIAblEs\nWe have primarily used ASI data at the \ufffd-digit level.

(2006), processing of nuclear fuels is likely to be affected by noneconomic factors, and hence \nwe drop them from our sample. \ufffdinally, reproduction of recorded media was introduced as a new category in \n1998.
