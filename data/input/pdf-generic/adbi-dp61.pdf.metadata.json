A starting point in \nmitigating  this  vulnerability  would  be  a  comprehensive  accessibility  improvement  that \nsubstantially  reduces  transportation  cost  and  isolation  of  the  rural  communities  from \nbasic  welfare  services.  An  advocacy  campaign  and/or  incentive  system  that  will \nencourage  private  firms  to  establish  operations  in  rural  areas  will  be  needed.  More \nprivate establishments in rural areas will not only shield the households against exposure \nto  vulnerability  but  will  also  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  microenterprise  development. \nSustainable rural development will follow provided that there is an ample corporate social \nresponsibility  program  among  these  firms  to  avert  widening  of  inequality.  A  natural \nresource management strategy will also be needed for ecological integrity.  \n\nParticipation  is  crucial  in  development  project  identification  to  minimize  wastage  of \nresources  and  possibly  reallocate  it  to  other  productive  uses.  Provision  of  rural  roads \nshould  be  bundled  properly  with  support  services  and  capacity-building  activities.  This \ncan  enhance  the  demand  for  other  infrastructure  and  services  resulting  to  a  dynamic \nevolution  of  essential  elements  in  the  pursuit  of  rural  development.  Bundles  of \nintervention  improve  production  efficiency  of  rural  households  at  the  different  stages  of \nproduction in-farm and/or off-farm. \n\nRural development interventions should pay special attention to the more vulnerable \nsegment,  the  farmers  especially,  with  the  goal  of  gradually  detaching  them  from \ncomplete dependence on agriculture without putting their food security at risk. \n\nPublic investment on infrastructure and user\u2019s fees can complement each other in the \ncontinuous provision of new infrastructure and maintenance of the existing infrastructure, \nfor a sustainable track towards rural development. The socialized user\u2019s fee system is a \npotential tool for preventing the widening income disparity in rural areas. It is important \nhowever to carefully choose a suitable and acceptable basis for the socialized user\u2019s fee \nrates.  An  incorrect  choice  can  be  perceived  as  a  disincentive  for  access  or  might \nstimulate  distrust  among  a  segment  of  the  rural  society  regarding  the  sincerity  of  the \ngovernment  in  pushing  rural  development.  This  might  eventually  create  more  social \nissues rather than bridging inequality. \n\nKeywords: rural development, rural infrastructure, development intervention, household \n\nmodel, spatial autoregression \n\n \n\n2 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe  Philippines  is  a  dominantly  agricultural  country.  Confinement  of  agricultural \nproduction  to  rural  areas  often  results  in  the  interchangeability  of  rural  and  agricultural \nissues.  As  of  the  2000  census,  the  population  was  estimated  at  76.5  million  with  52% \nresiding  in  rural  areas.  Labor  migration  in  favor  of  urban  centers  has  been  a  very \nprominent  social  phenomenon  in  the  last  two  decades,  causing  problems  both  in  rural \nareas (agricultural labor shortage) and in urban ones (primarily congestion).  \n\nA  large  portion  of  land  is  still  classified  as  rural  but  the  contribution  of  agriculture, \nfishery  and  forestry  to  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has  been  declining  since  the \n70\u2019s. In 1975, a few years after the Green Revolution program was launched, the output \nof  agriculture  sector  accounted  for  29%  of  the  GDP.  In  1987,  under  the  new \nadministration  benefiting  from  the  political  events  in  1986,  the  share  of  agriculture \ndropped  to  25%.  Ironically  in  1990,  more  than  a  year  after  the  implementation  of  the \nComprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program  (CARP),  the  share  of  agriculture  dropped \nfurther  to  22%.  In  2005,  the  structure  of  the  economy  was  such  that  service  sector \naccounted for 53%, industries for 33%, and agriculture, fishery and forestry for only 14% \nof the GDP. \n\nThe  declining  share  of  the  agriculture  sector  in  the  national  economy  may  also  be \ntaken as a proximate indicator of rural development. The thrust of interventions towards \nrural  development  and  poverty  alleviation  has  been  on  the  diversification  of  livelihood \nactivities. This could have potentially contributed to the increasing share of services and \nindustries  while  keeping  a  large  portion  of  the  population  in  the  rural  areas.  There  are \nemerging  small-scale  industries  and  value-adding  activities  whose  effects  yield  an \nincreasing share of the industries and services to the national economy. Some formerly \nurban-operating  agencies  could  also  be  relocated  to  the  rural  areas  as  a  result  of  the \nimprovement of infrastructure and support services.  \n\nSince  1985,  the  proportion  of  households  engaged  in  agricultural  activities  has \nfluctuated from 34% to 41%, clearly a sign of lower productivity in the sector since GDP \ncontribution  is  much  lower  than  these  numbers.  This  judgment  is  further  supported  by \nthe employment rate in agriculture, fishing and forestry, which was recorded at 43.4% in \n1995 and fell to 36.6% in 2006.  \n\nMarginalization of households in rural areas can be illustrated by poverty indicators. \nA comparative poverty incidence in rural and urban areas is given in Table 1.1. In 1985, \nthe poverty incidence in rural areas is about one-third more than that in urban areas. In \n2000,  rural  poverty  incidence  is  more  than  double  that  in  urban  areas,  implying  that \npoverty  alleviation  in  the  urban  Philippines  is  working  much  more  quickly  than  its  rural \ncounterpart. \n\n3 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 Poverty Incidence of Families in the Philippines \n\nSource  of  basic  data:  2003  Family  Income  and  Expenditures  Survey, \n\nNational Statistics Office (Philippines) \n\nTable  1.2  provides  the  distribution  of  the  population  earning  less  than  the  food \nthreshold  (computed  separately  for  rural  and  urban  households).  As  early  as  1985, \nalmost  three-fourths  of  those  falling  below  the  threshold  already  resided  in  rural  areas. \nThis  proportion  had  increased  further  by  2000,  another  possible  indicator  of  the \nvulnerability of rural households. \n\nTable 1.2 Distribution of Population Earning Less than the Food Threshold \n\nYear \n\nRural (%)\n\n1985 \n1988 \n1991 \n1994 \n1997 \n2000 \n\n50.7\n46.3\n48.6\n47.0\n44.4\n47.4\n\nUrban \n(%)\n33.6\n30.1\n31.1\n24.0\n17.9\n20.1\n\nYear \n\nRural (%)\n\n1985 \n1988 \n1991 \n1994 \n1997 \n2000 \n\n71.3\n71.7\n61.4\n66.4\n68.3\n78.1\n\nUrban \n(%)\n28.7\n28.3\n38.6\n33.6 \n31.7 \n21.9 \n\nSource of basic data: 2003 Family Income and Expenditures Survey, \n\nNational Statistics Office (Philippines) \n\nInequality  within  the  rural  sector  is  reflected  in  Table  1.3.  While  those  in  the  non-\nagricultural  sector  maintained  their  income  deciles  from  1994  to  2000,  those  in  the \nagricultural sector exhibited movement towards the lower income deciles. This illustrates \nfurther  widening  of  income  disparity  among  the  rural  households.  While  there  is  no \nalleviation  effect  among  the  non-agricultural  households  in  rural  areas,  the  agriculture \nsector  exhibited  a  worsening  situation.  The  analysis  identified  specific  marginalized \nsegments: the rural areas in general and agriculture in particular. \n\n4 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable 1.3 Distribution of Rural Households Across the Income Deciles \n \n\nIn the Non-Agriculture Sector \n\nIncome \nDeciles \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n\nIn the Agriculture Sector \n1994 \n20.00 \n19.06 \n17.68 \n14.01 \n11.56 \n7.73 \n4.80 \n2.83 \n1.57 \n0.77 \n\n1997\n16.25\n16.02\n15.38\n13.96\n11.47\n8.96\n6.72\n5.18\n3.67\n2.40\n\n2000\n22.11\n21.43\n19.45\n15.12\n10.42\n5.80\n3.04\n1.48\n0.84\n0.31\n\n1994\n10.23\n9.26\n9.52\n11.18\n11.50\n12.09\n11.33\n10.68\n8.40\n5.80\n\n1997 \n11.00 \n15.17 \n15.17 \n14.92 \n12.75 \n9.75 \n7.67 \n        4.83 \n3.83 \n4.92 \n\n2000\n10.42\n10.72\n10.94\n12.42\n12.40\n11.62\n9.89\n9.11\n7.66\n4.82\n\nSource of basic data: 2003 Family Income and Expenditures Survey, \n\nNational Statistics Office (Philippines) \n\nWhat  has  the  government  been  doing  so  far? The  Official Development  Assistance \n(ODA) fund has been clear about its priorities. In the fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004, \nthe fund allotted 20%, 22%, and 19%, respectively, to the agriculture, natural resources, \nand  agrarian  reform  sector.  For  the  same  years,  ODA  disbursements  for  infrastructure \nare  65%  (2002),  59%  (2003),  and  64%  (2004).  Given  that  the  bulk  of  infrastructure \nprojects  are  on  road  construction,  the  allocation  for  infrastructure  in  general  should  be \nbeneficial  to  the  rural  areas;  accessibility  is  not  exclusively  for  urban  households. \nGovernment  response  is  not  biased  against  the  rural  areas  after  all.  What  then  is  the \ncause  of  the  inequality  and  marginalization  happening  among  rural  households  and \namong  farmers  specifically?  This  paper  explores  some  reasons,  determinants,  and \nplausible explanations concerning the issues surrounding rural development.  \n\n1.1  RATIONALE \n\nThis  study  is  motivated  by  two  issues:  first,  the  role  of  perceptions  of  the \nstakeholders in assessing the impact of development projects; second, the role of rural \nroads  in  facilitating/complementing  the  delivery  of  other  rural  infrastructure,  support \nservices, and capacity-building activities. \n\nRural development is a very complicated phenomenon; usually it is a long-term and \niterative  process.  Development  projects  are  commonly  assessed  during  the  mid-term \nand after project completion. Many projects are implemented in a medium-period range \nand by the time of their completion, their real outcomes for rural development have not \nyet  manifested.  The  success  of  these  projects  then  is  assessed  based  only  on \naccomplishment of the implementation plan and not on the rural development outcomes. \nSimilar loopholes are duplicated in the design of future projects, and potential outcomes \nof  similar  prototypes  are  seldom  integrated  into  the  design.  Appleton and  Booth  (2001) \nproposed that instead of measuring the final outcome, the intermediate process should \nbe  examined  through  participatory  approaches  and  using  measurements  based  on \nperceptions. \n\nThe  sociological  perspectives  of  development  point  out  direct  linkages  between \nperceptions and actual economic manifestations. Once the stakeholders exhibit positive \nchanges in their perception, the actual economic manifestation is not far from appearing. \nPerception  changes  also  contribute/advocate  a  sense  of  ownership  among  the \nbeneficiaries, an important pre-requisite for sustainability. Perception thus will serve two \npurposes: as a proxy/leading indicator of potential rural development outcome and as a \n\n5 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nsource  of  information  on  how  sense  of  ownership  can  be  advocated  towards \nsustainability.  In  addition,  among  conflict  areas  like  many  parts  of  the  rural  Philippines, \npeace and development are intertwined, and in such cases, perception can best provide \ninitial indicators of progress in both directions. \n\nKottak (1991) argues that the desired development targets can hardly be realized if \nthe  target  beneficiaries\u2019  perceptions  are  not  congruent  with  those  of  the  implementers. \nThis  is  true  in  the  rural  Philippines  especially  in  conflict  areas  and  among  indigenous \npeoples.  An  infrastructure  project  is  not  completely  successful  in  the  viewpoint  of  the \nbeneficiaries if they feel that they were less involved during the identification and in the \nimplementation. The perceptions of the stakeholders can provide valuable insights as to \nhow to adjust the project design, fix the project menu, and other aspects of the project to \nensure  the  greatest  possible  benefits.  The  real  economic  outcomes  can  be  measured \nlater once they begin to manifest. In the meantime, the project implementers can benefit \nfrom these perceptions to fine-tune the project perimeters before the funding resources \nare misdirected.  \n\nPerception data can help generate information on stakeholder-initiated (participatory) \npolicy directions and can be used in planning and implementation of rural infrastructure, \nespecially  for  farm  roads.  Kottak  (1991)  warned  that  development  agencies  that  ignore \ncultural diversity and adopt a uniform approach to deal with very heterogeneous project \nbeneficiaries may be wasting the already limited resources.  \n\nSome important findings from a 2005 survey by the National Development Authority \nand the World Bank\u2019s Asia-Europe Meeting (NEDA-WB-ASEM, 2005) include the value \nthat  the  stakeholders  place  on  rural  roads  in  stimulating  development  and  the \nadvantages  of  bundles  of  interventions  over  stand-alone  interventions.  Higher  benefits \nwere  realized  whenever  interventions  came  in  bundles  as  compared  to  their  marginal \nindividual  benefits.  In  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  studies,  rural  roads  appeared  to \nbe the most favored intervention among the beneficiaries. Certain crops in isolated areas \nwere  reported  to  be  unharvested  because  harvesting  and  transportation  cost  could  be \nhigher than the farm gate price the traders are willing to offer. This can seriously affect \nequilibrium and cause the farming system to completely change because it can send an \nincorrect signal to the farmer that certain crops have no market or are not marketable at \nall. Improved accessibility should lead further towards provision/facilitation of other needs \nlike post-harvest facilities and training. Delivery of such interventions is facilitated by the \nimprovement of accessibility for the rural community.  \n\nSome  work  regarding  the  role  of  roads  in  rural  development  is  surveyed  in  the \nsucceeding sections. As a potential contribution to better understand the policy directions \nneeded  in  targeting  rural  development,  this  paper  offers  an  empirical  household  model \nintegrating  spatial  dependencies  and  estimated  from  perception  data.  This  can  help \nmitigate  the  wasteful  allocation  of  development  assistance  in  rural  areas  by  identifying \nwhere  this  assistance  is  needed  most  and  where  greater  benefits  can  be  expected. \nAppropriate  policies  will  hopefully  resolve  the  vulnerability  and  inequality  that  now \ncharacterizes  rural  communities.  Results  of  the  study  may  also  be  extended  to  cross-\ncountry comparisons to generate broader policy orientation. \n\n1.2  OBJECTIVES \n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  study  is  to  assess  the  impact  of  roads  and  other  rural \ninfrastructure  on  perception  and  actual  construct  (income)  of  rural  development.  The \nmain  issue  to  be  resolved  is  the  role  of  a  participatory  assessment  of  infrastructure \ndemand  to  be  able  to  attain  higher  returns  in  terms  of  actual  and  perceived  rural \ndevelopment.  Specific  objectives  include  the  development  of  econometric  models  that \n\n6 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nwill  link  the  provision  of  rural  infrastructure  (e.g.,  roads)  and  perceived  and  actual \nconstructs of rural development. We will also identify bundles of rural infrastructure and \ncapacity-building  interventions  along  with  farm  roads  that  will  yield  optimal  impact \ntowards rural development. Finally, we will also assess the impact of perceived demand \nfor infrastructure on perceived and actual constructs of rural development. \n\nRural  areas  are  typically  characterized  by  agrarian-based  economic  activities  and \nbecause  of  this,  oftentimes,  rural  and  agriculture  is  used  interchangeably.  Bale  (1999) \ndefined the basic elements of rural development to include social infrastructure, physical \ninfrastructure, and financial services. The interaction of these three elements is expected \nto push development in rural communities. Rural development is characterized in terms \nof  the  manifestation  of  income  and  employment,  equitable  access  to  productive \nresources, sustainable development of natural resources and human capital. \n\n1.3  SIGNIFICANCE \n\nAs  explained  above,  development  project  resources  may  be  wasted  due  to \nevaluation  focusing  on  implementation  efficiency  rather  than  on  outcomes.  With  a \nparticipatory  assessment  of  project  impact  using  stakeholders\u2019  perception  during  the \ncourse  of  implementation,  the  data  can  be  used  as  input  to  adjust  the  project\u2019s  logical \nframework.  This  will  help  pave  the  way  towards  the  ultimate  attainment  of  project \noutcomes.  This  participatory  assessment  can  also  advocate  a  sense  of  ownership \namong the beneficiaries. \n\nThe  models  will  provide  empirical  evidence  on  the  impact  of  infrastructure, \nspecifically roads, towards rural development. The dynamics in which such development \ninterventions eventually result in rural development will be characterized. The models will \nalso  help  in  projecting  the  possible  effect  of  a  project  even  before  the  implementation. \nThe intensity of inputs needed to attain a goal can thus be programmed accordingly. This \ninformation can also help identify the bundles or specific types of interventions that are \nsuited  for  a given  community  so  that  resources will  not  be  spread  too  thin.  Bundling  of \nintervention  may  help  reveal  how  multilateral  agencies  can  pool  resources  to  optimize \ntheir  impact.  The  household  models  may  also  help  explain  inequality  among  rural \nhouseholds.  Finally,  the  study  will  help  generate  policy  directions  that  will  ensure  that \ndevelopment interventions will improve the living conditions of rural households, and that \nthe risk of vulnerability and inequality will be minimized if not completely eliminated.  \n\n2 \n\nRURAL DEVELOPMENT \n\nRural  societies  live  in  a  simple  environment,  yet  the  structure  and  the  dynamics  of \ntheir day-to-day life is complex. Patterns of social processes vary across countries, and \neven  across  regions  within  a  country;  these  patterns  are  highly  sensitive  to  cultural \ndifferences.  The  study  of  rural  societies  has  drawn  interest  not  only  in  development \neconomics  but  also  in  many  other  disciplines.  The  panoramic  view  of  developing \neconomies  is  dominated  by  rural  societies.  Vulnerability,  inequity,  and  deprivation  are \ncommon \ndevelopment \nassistance/interventions targeting this sector.  \n\nconfronting \n\nprompting \n\nsocieties, \n\nissues \n\nrural \n\nIncome  vulnerability  is  one  major  issue  confronting  rural  societies.  This  issue  is \nstrongly interdependent with other thematic issues. In their own initiative to avoid income \nvulnerability,  rural  households  tend  to  find  ways  to  augment  their  livelihood,  which  is \nbasically  agriculture  in  a  limited  parcel  of  land.  Their  natural  strategy  for  income \naugmentation  often  results  to  excessive,  unsustainable  use/harvesting  of  natural \n\n7 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nresources. Some examples are clearing of forest for additional agricultural land, logging, \nover-fishing (even using illegal tools/gear) in inland and coastal water, and intensive crop \nproduction  resulting  in  massive  environmental  degradation.  Some  join  the  rural-urban \nlabor migration that has been rampant in the rural Philippines for the last three decades. \nInitially,  such  a  process  is  motivated  by  conflict  and  social  unrest;  later  and  up  to  the \npresent, poverty and the evolving economic landscape also contribute to the process. \n\nRural  development  has  become  one  of \n\nthe  major  aims  of  various \nassistance/intervention  programs  of  both  individual  developing  countries  and  of \nmultilateral  institutions/donors.  A  clear  understanding  of  rural  development  dynamics  is \nnecessary for these programs to prosper. In addition, the inadequate indicators of rural \ndevelopment have become a constraint in development planning because an information \ngap  in  one  of  its  facets  will  cripple  an  integrated  assistance  program.  Thus,  any \ncontribution towards the understanding of rural development is valuable. \n\n2.1  RURAL DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS \n\nThe  literature  offers  a  wide  range  of  viewpoints  on  rural  development  and  provides \nconstructs  that  can  be  used  in  measurement/monitoring.  Bale  (1999)  as  cited  in \nGovernment  of  the  Philippines  and  World  Bank  (GoP  and  WB,  2000)  defines  rural \ndevelopment  as  including  \u201cthe  provision  of  social  and  physical  infrastructure,  the \nprovision  of  financial  services  in  non  urban  areas,  non-farm  and  small-medium \nenterprises activities in rural communities and market towns that are more closely linked \nto the rural economy than they are to the economies of the larger urban cities, as well as \nthe  development  of  traditional  rural  sectors,  such  as  agriculture  and  natural  resource \nmanagement.\u201d  The  key  elements  that  will  facilitate  the  realization  of  rural  development \ninclude social infrastructure, physical infrastructure, and financial services. The dynamics \nof  these  three  elements  will  pave  the  way  to  uplift  the  living  conditions  of  rural \nhouseholds.  Observing  events  and  issues  related  to  such  dynamics  can  facilitate  the \nmeasurement of the constructs of rural development.  \n\nThe rural development strategy for the Philippines is outlined in GoP and WB (2000). \nIt identifies the following: (i) Deepen and implement key structural reforms to help ensure \na  sustained,  higher,  and  broad-based  growth  of  agriculture,  by  removing  policy  and \ninstitutional  distortions  and  making  the  sector  more  efficient  and  internationally  more \ncompetitive;  (ii)  Facilitate \nincreased  and  prioritized  strategic  public  and  private \ninvestments; (iii) Improve natural resource management; and (iv) Strengthen institutional \nframework,  capacity and performance. The Medium Term  Philippine Development  Plan \n(MTPDP)  also  identified  outcomes  for  the  rural  sector:  (i)  increased  rural  incomes  and \nemployment;  (ii)  more  equitable  access  to  productive  resources;  (iii)  sustainable \ndevelopment  of  natural  resources/enhanced  ecological  integrity;  and  (iv)  empowerment \nof rural communities/human capital development.  \n\n2.2  RURAL AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT \n\nThe prominence of agriculture among rural communities naturally results in linkages \nbetween  rural  and  agricultural  development.  The  role  of  agricultural  development  in \nfostering  rural  development  cannot  be  ignored.  The  engine  of  agricultural  development \nrelies  on  facilitating  production  and  efficient  utilization  of  resources  among  the  farming \nhouseholds.  The  study  of  agricultural  development  then  boils  down  to  understanding \nhow  factors  of  production  (technology,  social  and  economic  support  services)  are \nefficiently allocated to optimize output/outcome.  \n\nOne commonly used strategy to complement agricultural development towards rural \ndevelopment is the facilitation of non-farm livelihood. The result (outcome) is essentially \n\n8 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nrural  income  diversification.  Empirical  evidence  provides  crucial  inputs  (see  Barrett,  et \nal., 2002 for instance) for the extraction of policies that can result in the diversification of \nrural income.  \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nfactors  of  production \n\nHow  do  we  stimulate  agricultural  development?  This  question  is  best  answered  by \nanalyzing  each  of \nthe  context  of  production \noptimization/efficiency.  The  role  of  land  ownership  in  agricultural  production  has  long \nbeen used as a justification for agrarian reform programs in various countries. Farmers \nwill be free to choose a resource allocation scheme that will optimize production if they \nare  not  entangled  in  the  bondage  of  the  land,  when  there  is  no  landlord  who  decides \nprimarily  and  may  not  have  direct  knowledge  of  the  farming  system,  deciding  solely \nbased  on  profit  incentives.  Production  is  inefficient  when  the  farmer  does  not  own  the \nland. A lower stake may mean a farmer will put forth less effort and will not necessarily \ngrow highly profitable crops (Bandiera, 2002). However, when the farmer owns the land, \nhe  or  she  may  opt  to  plant  high-value  crops  and  exert  proportional  efforts  to  enhance \nproductivity.  Similar  observations  were  made  by  Larson  and  Plessmann  (2002),  that \nfarming households that differ in their ability or willingness to take on risks are likely to \nmake different decisions when allocating resources and effort among income-producing \nactivities  with  consequences  on  productivity.  Diversification  and  technology  choices  do \naffect efficiency outcomes among farmers, although these effects are not dominant. In a \nsimilar context, but on a higher level of empowerment (organized community), Ranis et \nal. (2001) highlight the linkages between group behavior and economic performance.  \n\nThere are however, other points of view concerning the land ownership issues. Using \na  modern  theory  of  agrarian  organization,  Conning  and  Robinson  (2002)  offered  a \nreason  why  tenure  improvement,  despite  its  economic  advantages,  has  been  so  little \nused in countries where agrarian reform is a salient political issue, explaining the relative \nfailure of land reform in Latin America.  \n\nIn  the  Philippines,  resistance  among  the  landowners  was  very  common,  so  that  no \ntangible results were observed during the first few years after the implementation of the \nComprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program  (CARP).  Now  that  the  resistance  has  been \nreduced to a few regions, real progress among agrarian reform communities (ARCs) is \nstarting  to  show.  The  features  of  the  enabling  policies  of  the  agrarian  reform  law, \nhowever, can possibly dampen agricultural development. The CARP allows retention of \nonly  seven  hectares  of  land  among  the  landowners,  while  the  tenants  can  own  an \nindeterminately small parcel of land. The average farm size cultivated by households is \njust  a  little  more  than  half  a  hectare.  This  prevents  farmers  from  benefiting  from \ntechnology advancement and other farm implements because doing so with such a small \nparcel is not cost-effective. This criticism is consistent with the observation of Mundlak et \nal. (2002) that new technology changed the returns to fertilizer, irrigated land and capital, \nall  of  which  proved  scarce  to  varying  degrees,  partially  explained  by  farm  size.  Since \nmuch of the production is done on small farms, increasing concentration of production on \nsmall farms can contribute to declining productivity.  \n\nDevelopment policies can also lead towards the opposite of what has been expected. \nBoothroyd et al. (Eds., 2000) observed that in Viet Nam, the lack of appropriate balance \nin  agricultural/industrial  and \nthe  necessary \nendogenous  factors  for  development.  Streams  of  people  have  surged  into  towns  and \ncities,  crowding  into  slums  and  leaving  behind  a  destitute,  miserable  countryside. \nAnalyses  by  policymakers  and  leading  scientific  researchers  led  to  a  conclusion  that \nbecause of the small scale of agricultural cooperatives, conditions were not conducive to \na  re-division  of  labor  in  the  direction  of  centralization  and  specialization  that  would \npromote enhanced production.  \n\nrural/urban  development  deprived \n\n9 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2.3 \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT \n\ninfrastructure \n\nDevelopment  intervention  can  be  broadly  classified  into  four  (possibly  overlapping) \ncategories:  economic \n(e.g.,  credit,  production  support);  physical \ninfrastructure  (e.g.,  roads,  irrigation);  capacity  building  (e.g.,  training,  information \ndissemination);  and  support  services  (e.g.,  marketing  services,  facilitation  of  access  to \nbasic social services). Physical and economic infrastructure has been emphasized from \nthe start but it seems that the policies and other implementing guidelines may have not \nevolved  completely  to  support  development.  Progress  among  developing  countries, \nparticularly  in  rural  areas,  has  been  slow.  The  role  of  infrastructure  in  development  is \nemphasized  in  the  literature.  In  most  poverty  reduction  strategy  programs  (PRSPs), \nfinancing  demand  usually  focuses  on  infrastructure  like  roads,  potable  water  systems, \nand  irrigation  systems.  Some  studies  that  link  infrastructure  and  development  are \npresented. \n\nTheoretical  investigation  was  done  by  Holtz-Eakin  and  Lovely  (1995),  where  a \ngeneral  equilibrium  model  was  used  and  proved  that  public  infrastructure  affects  factor \nprices,  intermediate  prices,  and  allocation  of  factors  across  sectors.  The  aggregate \noutput  of  the  manufacturing  sector  however  is  not  affected.  Cowie  (2002)  pointed  out \nthat gain in productivity (referring to a railway system) is not necessarily due to form of \nownership but on the organizational strategies implemented. \n\nRural  areas  are  characterized  by  isolation,  lack  or  inadequate  provision  of  basic \namenities, inadequate health and social services, etc. Isolation needs to be resolved to \nenable the other issues to be resolved. Farm roads facilitate access to the major supply \nsource and market destinations. Roads are expected to facilitate the reduction of costs \nfor  transportation  of  farm  inputs  and  for  bringing  the  produce  to  the  market.  Although \nGlaeser  and  Kohlhase  (2003)  focused  on  peri-urban  centers,  they  reported  an  efficient \nroad system would enable an estimated 90% reduction in the cost of transporting goods. \nLowering  transportation  costs  has  such  implications  as:  people  are  no  longer  tied  to \nnatural  resources,  consumer-related  natural  advantages  become  more  important, \npopulation  is  increasingly  centralized  in  a  few  metropolitan  regions,  people  are \nincreasingly  decentralized  within  those  regions,  high-density  housing  and  public \ntransportation  become  increasingly  irrelevant,  location  of  manufacturing  firms  is  not \ndriven by proximity to customers or suppliers, and provision of education.  \n\nAlthough  the  economic  importance  of  infrastructure  is  supported,  some  negative \nsocial  consequences  may  be  present  as  well.  Dams,  for  example,  are  perceived  to \ncontribute towards sustainability of irrigation. They are also costly and controversial, but \nDulfo  and  Pande  (2005)  emphasized  that  less  is  known  about  their  impact.  In  an  area \nwhere  dams  were  constructed  in  India,  production  has  not  increased  but  poverty  has. \nAmong  areas  benefiting  from  irrigation,  production  increased,  but  those  residing  in  the \nareas  that  become  flooded  because  of  the  dam  suffered  substantial  economic  losses, \nthus  widening  inequality.  It  was  argued  however  that  as  a  whole,  dam  construction \nresults in worsening poverty because no safety nets were provided to the disadvantaged \nsegment of the community. \n\nThe localization of infrastructure development polices was studied by Demurger et al. \n(2002) in China with the conclusion that there is geographic inequity of growth. There is \na  perception  that  coastal  areas  in  China  benefit  from  preferential  policies,  but  this  is \nactually  because  of  deregulation  policies  that  allow  them  to  link  to  the  international \neconomy.  Instead  of  imposing  back  regulations,  the  expansion  of  deregulation  to  inner \nprovinces  can  help  improve  growth  speed.  Infrastructure  development  to  improve \naccessibility of inner provinces is needed along with human capital development towards \npoverty alleviation. \n\n10 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nCountries  that  use  infrastructure  inefficiently  are  effectively  paying  for  growth  at  a \nmuch  higher  rate  than  are  those  that  use  infrastructure  more  efficiently  (Hulten,  1996). \nCapital stocks (infrastructure) that are not efficiently used would render marginal growth \nfor  additional  capital  formation.  This  usually  happens  when  infrastructure  identification \nlacks community  participation,  resulting  in  supply-demand  mismatch.  Furthermore,  new \ninvestments  (capital)  need  not  indicate  economic  growth,  while  efficient  use  of  such \ntranslates  into  real  growth.  Hence,  maintenance  and  sustainability  are  more  important \nthan putting up more new investments. \n\ninfrastructure  viewed  as \n\nThe  effect  of  public  infrastructure  on  Philippine  agriculture  has  been  established. \nTeruel  and  Kuroda  (2005)  used  a  trans-log  cost  function  framework  augmented  with \npublic \nlabor  and \nintermediate  inputs.  This  supports  the  public  capital  hypothesis  of  complementation \nbetween public infrastructure and private capital input. The importance of farm roads in \naltering input demand and enhancing productivity is also established.  \n\nInfrastructure  substitutes \n\ninput. \n\nfixed \n\nA  more  advanced  econometric  approach  was  used  by  Fedderke  et  al.  (2006)  in \nanalyzing the effect of infrastructure expenditures on long-run economic growth in South \nAfrica. They used a vector error correction model (VECM) and concluded that the role of \ninfrastructure  is  in  terms  of  raising  the  marginal  productivity  of  capital  and  encouraging \nprivate  investments.  This  is  especially  true  for  roads  that  generally  bring  down \ntransaction  costs  of  trading.  They  found  that  investment  in  infrastructure  leads  to \neconomic  growth,  but  there  is  weak  evidence  that  this  will  in  turn  lead  to  new \ninfrastructure. \n\n2.4 \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND POVERTY REDUCTION \n\nFunding  of  basic  infrastructure  is  essential  to  progress  towards  social  development \n(Hemson  et  al,  2004).  Such  infrastructure  can  facilitate  rural  development  and,  hence, \npoverty  alleviation.  Rural  development  is  closely  associated  with  the  empowerment  of \nrural  communities,  which  has  to  include  the  encouragement  of  civil  society  and  public \nparticipation  in  decision  making  in  a  democratic  culture.  The  International  Labour \nOrganization  (ILO,  2005)  assessed  the  dynamics  between  accessibility  and  poverty. \nIsolation  of  poor  communities  leads  to  poor  access  to  basic  goods  like  health  and \neducation,  common  risk  factors  that  result  initially  in  deprivation  and  eventually  in \npoverty.  Rural  infrastructure  is  seen  as  a  means  of  facilitating  access  to  such  goods. \nRecent experience pointed out that although provision of infrastructure is necessary, it is \nnot sufficient for poverty reduction. Sustainable rural infrastructure development is viable \nif  accompanied  by  four  strategies:  local  level  planning,  labor-based  technology,  small-\nscale contracting, and a rural infrastructure maintenance system. \n\nthe \n\nlocal  governance  system, \n\nThe role of community participation in enhancing local public service delivery cannot \nbe \nlocal \nignored.  The  dynamics  between \nthe \nadministrators, the community, and higher levels of administration can facilitate or be a \nhindrance to development (DasGupta et al., 2003). The role of community participation is \nimportant because of community members\u2019 knowledge/understanding of the environment \nas well as the asymmetries of information among the households and the fact that they \nare directly affected by the outcomes. A development directed state-community synergy \nshould  be  enhanced  by  interventions  that  could  reduce  power  imbalance  among \ncommunity members, e.g., land reform, development of non-crop source of income, etc. \nPolicies  at  the  higher  level  of  governance  can  bypass  the  vested  interest  of  local \nadministrators,  thereby  becoming  more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  households. \nInstitutional  reforms  at  the  local  and  community  levels  can  be  enhanced  by  various \nfactors,  including  the  generation  of  community  demand  for  better  public  goods  and \ninclude \nservices  (participatory \n\nfostering  development.  This  may \n\nin  nature) \n\nin \n\n11 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nempowerment strategies like capacity building and rural infrastructure resulting in lower \ntransportation  costs,  access  to  farm  inputs,  and  access  to  markets.  Improved \naccessibility  will  minimize  if  not  eliminate  the  information  asymmetry  between  the \nsuppliers (of inputs), traders (of produce), retailers (of food products), and producers. \n\nInvestigation on the impact on poverty of globalization and growth in non-traditional \nexport was done by Balat and Porto (2005). They concluded that policies that basically \nexpand  opportunities  for  Zambian  households  to  earn  higher  incomes  help  in  poverty \nalleviation. To secure higher levels of well being, complementary policies like provision of \ninfrastructure credit and extension services are necessary. \n\nUsing the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS) 2 (1997\u201398) and LECS \n3  (2002\u201303),  Warr  (2005)  regressed  per  capita  expenditure  on  socio-demographic \nindicators, area dummy variables, access to some infrastructure, and provincial dummy \nvariables to establish that provision of road access even for the dry season alone could \nresult  in  poverty  reduction  (higher  per  capita  expenditure).  An  even  higher  reduction \nwould be expected if road access was available during the wet and dry seasons. \n\nIn the area of measurements and data collection, Gomez-Lobo et al. (2000) pointed \nout  possible  enhancements  of  the  Living  Standard  Monitoring  Survey  (LSMS)  to \ngenerate information that would be useful in the development of policy options towards \ninfrastructure development. It was pointed out, though, that sample design improvements \nare  needed  along  with  data  collection  strategies  to  ensure  collection  of  relevant \ninformation. Such information is needed both in policy formulation for efficient provision \nof infrastructure and in linking infrastructure and development.  \n\n2.5  COMPLEMENTING RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT \n\nConsider the following scenario: a one-kilometer rural road that adjoins the main road \nvein  but  is  five  kilometers  away  from  the  production  area;  a  solar  dryer  facility  at  the \ncenter of the community but without ample storage facilities; a good road network with a \nwell maintained irrigation system but no source of financing to procure production inputs; \na credit cooperative but no micro-enterprise that will support its robustness to borrowing \nand  lending  behavior  of  members.  Such  intervention  strategies  will  sooner  or  later  fail \nbecause  their  inadequacies  may  outweigh  their  real  benefits  in  the  eyes  of  the \nstakeholders.  The  intention  is  sometimes  noble  and  fair,  but  once  the  resources  are \nspread  too  thin,  the  benefits  promised  will  not  be  delivered.  Although  it  may  not  look \ndemocratic, higher density of interventions in an area (others may not benefit at all at the \nstart)  so  that  each  properly  planned  intervention  complements  the  other  may  yield \nmultiplier effects spreading beyond the initially targeted community. \n\nHousehold welfare is measured in terms of changes in consumption level, Chong et \nal.  (2004)  used  panel  data  and  analyzed  it  using  three  subsets:  households  with  the \nsame  head  between  periods,  households  whose  size  did  not  change  during  the  study \nperiod,  and  households  with  the  same  head  and  size  during  the  study  period.  The \nsubsets  are  aimed  to  control  exogenous  effects  of  household  characteristics  on \nconsumption patterns. Benefits are higher among those receiving two or more services \nthan  the  aggregate  of  the  marginal  effect  of  each  of  the  services.  This  proves  that  a \nbundle  of  interventions  is  always  better  and  more  efficient  than  individual,  stand-alone \ninterventions. \n\nA  neoclassical  production  function  was  postulated  by  Jacoby  (2000),  who  used  a \nsemiparametric  approach  to  estimate  the  road  benefits  at  the  household  level  and \ncompare it across income levels. While the low-income group benefited significantly from \nthe  roads,  is  the  benefit  was  not  enough  to  offset  the  income  inequality  among  rural \n\n12 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nhouseholds. Jacoby did point out, however, that in addition to lower transportation costs, \nfarm  roads  also  increase  access  to  basic  social  services  like  education  and  health. \nRoads  will  not  only  reduce  transportation  costs,  but  will  in  the  long-run  lead  to \nimprovement in living condition.  \n\nThe  millennium  development  goals  (MDG)  are  multi-sectoral,  so  collaborative \nintervention  is  needed  to  attain  them.  Fay  et  al.  (2005)  highlighted  the  role  of \ninfrastructure  in  attaining  the  MDG  (relating  to  children).  Infrastructure  may  have  direct \neffects  in  facilitating  the  delivery  of  health  care  and  access  to  health  services,  and \nindirect  effects  in  contributing  to  output  (GDP)  that  in  turn  improves  health  services \nprovision and the provision of basic services in general. \n\n3 \n\nHOUSEHOLD MODELS \n\nThe  usefulness  of  an  econometric  model  depends  on  the  soundness  of  the \nassumptions  underlying  the  mathematical  equation.  The  plausibility  of  the  model  to \ndepict reality is crucial in development studies aimed to understand the patterns and the \nengines that fuel progress of an economic unit.  \n\nLewis (1984) divided development theories into those relating to short-run allocation \nof  resources  and  those  relating  to  long-term  growth.  In  the  short-run,  the  main  issues \ninclude  price  that  does  not  equate  real  social  cost;  unregulated  market  that  constraints \nproductive capacity; and production and exchange governed not by income maximization \nobjective,  but  rather  by  other  \u201cnon-economic\u201d  considerations.  Decision  making  in \ndevelopment  economics  is  not  done  on  the  sole  merits  of  economics  alone,  but \nintegrating  sociological  perspectives  as  well  (social  cost,  specifically).  In  the  long-term \ngrowth,  two  major  issues  exist:  the  search  for  the  engine  of  growth,  and  the  growth \npattern. For the rural poor, a typical package serving as the growth engine includes land \nreform, infrastructure, production support, and capacity building. Lewis further proposed \nthat the real question is, given an intervention policy, how much change in development \nindicators do we expect? If so much land will be distributed for tenure improvement, how \nmuch increase in rural income is expected? In other words, it is not enough to say that \ninfrastructure  leads  to  income  growth;  the  more  relevant  information  is  the  amount  of \ncontribution expected for a unit of infrastructure added.  \n\nTo  determine  the  impact  of  policy  reforms  in  rural  economies,  the  reaction  of \nhouseholds  to  policy  shocks  was  modeled  by  Taylor  et  al.  (2005).  The  computable \ngeneral equilibrium (CGE) model was used, and while the resulting model accounts for \nthe  interaction  among  sectors,  it  was  not  able  to  assess  household  behavior  as  a \nconsequence of the policy shock. They proposed a new methodology that combines the \nadvantages of both approaches (household and CGE  models). Simulation was used to \nillustrate the role of the rural market constraints and the heterogeneity of the households \nin shaping household behavior.  \n\n3.1  AGRICULTURAL HOUSEHOLD MODELS \n\nThe  Hymer-Resnik  Model  (Hymer  and  Resnik,  1969)  is  one  of  the  more  prominent \nagrarian household models used to characterize conditions in various countries. Hymer \nand  Resnik  postulated  a  model  of  an  agrarian  economy  where  the  rural  household  is \nfacing  alternatives  including  nonagricultural  and  non-leisure  activities.  The  initial stages \nof  the  development  program  can  be  financed  from  internal  trade  creation,  they  argued. \nSubstitution  occurs  because  of  the  shift  from  inferior  methods  of  home  production  to \nsuperior  methods  based  on  specialization  and  exchange.  The  development  problem \n\n13 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nfocuses  on  the  adaptation  of  industrial  production  to  rural  needs,  and  the  authors \nrecommended  that  government  policy  consider  two  targets:  a  dynamic  industrial  sector \ncatering  to  the  requirements  of  the  agricultural  sector,  and  a  communication  and \ntransport  system  to  facilitate  the  flow  of  goods,  capital,  and  labor  among  all  trading \npartners (rural and urban economy). They further pointed out that social cost associated \nwith  increased  specialization,  even  with  the  enhancement  of  allocation  and  division  of \nlabor, cannot be avoided. In the absence of adequate redistribution mechanisms, gains \nfrom  trade  will  be  spread  unevenly,  and  certain  sectors  may  not  be  able  to  share  the \nwealth  but  rather  will  be  marginalized  further.  This  model  provides  a  rationale  for  the \nearly theories of poverty and inequality.  \n\nThe  observations  of  Hymer  and  Resnik  may  still  help  in  understanding  present-day \nrural  household  income  vulnerability.  Because  of  the  growing  demand  for  certain \ncrops/commodities in other areas, information asymmetry between the producer and the \nconsumer increases. The trader then enters into the scene to serve as a broker for such \ninformation  and  invests  through  commodity  financing  schemes.  While  trade  flourishes, \nthe producer is compelled to specialize further because of his bondage with the trader, \nleading  to  even  lower  income  levels.  While  many  stakeholders  benefit  from  increasing \ntrade,  the  producers  (farmers)  who  have  inadequate  information  will  continue  to  suffer \nand  become  more  vulnerable,  resulting  in  glaring  income  disparities  and  hence \ninequality. \n\nAgricultural  household  models  are  being  recast  to  reflect  the  imperfect  market \nenvironment typical among less-developed countries\u2019 (LDC) rural economies (Taylor and \nin  analyzing  how  household-specific \nAdelman,  2003).  These  models  are  used \ntransaction  costs  reflect  the  impact  of  exogenous  policy  and  market  changes  in  rural \nareas. Taylor and Adelman assumed a Cobb-Douglas production function, fitted models \nusing  data  from  Mexico,  and  used  it  in  simulating  NAFTA-related  policy  effects  under \ndifferent  market  scenarios.  They  pointed  out  that  income  effects  of  policy  changes  are \nusually  not  equally  distributed  among  rural  households,  a  common  feature  among \nhousehold-farm models. They examined agricultural households\u2019 behavior in the context \nof  both  internal  conflicts  over  resource  use  as  well  as  the  external  market  and  non-\nmarket relationships in which they are embedded. \n\n3.2  PARTICIPATORY ASSESSMENT AND MODELING \n\nData  collected  through  participatory  methods  used  to  be  analyzed  only  through \nqualitative  approaches.  Such  analysis  usually  provides  input  data  in  comparative  case \nstudies where a more \u201csuccessful\u201d story is placed alongside a \u201cfailure\u201d to discern factors \nthat  can  be  said  to  determine  \u201csuccess.\u201d  Participatory  assessment  is  also  used  in  the \ndevelopment of community-based projects, which use demand-driven strategies that are \nproven to result in better sustainability prospects.  \n\nRegression models using ordinary least squares were applied by Prokopy (2005) to \nestimate  project  outcomes  in  an  infrastructure  project  (water  system).  Outcomes  were \nmeasured  in  terms  of  household  satisfaction,  equity  in  access,  and  saved  time  (from \nwater  collection).  The  significant  effects  of  capital  cost  contribution  and  level  of \nhousehold  participation  were  established.  It  was  recommended  that  development \nprojects continue to encourage both contributions and participation, but it was noted that \nneither ensures payment of tariff (for sustainability). Contributions in terms of user\u2019s fees \nand  participation  in  project  planning  and  in  maintenance  strategies  lead  to  the \nbeneficiaries\u2019 sense of ownership. The sense of ownership, in turn, stimulates the project \nto  become  more  sustainable.  User\u2019s  fees,  however,  should  be  matched  with  local \ngovernment  subsidies  in  the  initial  stage  of  project  maintenance.  Gradual  withdrawal \nmay be initiated once the sustainability structure is in place. \n\n14 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nThe  thrust  of  decentralization  was  argued  by  Asthana  (2003)  as  an  element  of \nparticipation. The author argued that intuitively, public services provided by those closer \nto the people are more appealing, a justification for the existence of local governments. \nThe  efficiency  of  such  decentralization,  however,  is  not  empirically  established \nconsidering drinking  water  provision  in  Central  India.  This  is  true  in  many  development \nprojects in the Philippines as well. In agriculture, where the functions of the Department \nof Agriculture had been delegated to the local government units after the decentralization \nlaw in the early 90\u2019s, interventions that are direct provision of inputs for production have \nto  go  through  the  local  politicians.  At  that  level,  the  power  dyad  prevails,  resulting  in \nunequal distribution. Aside from the fact that those resources are not necessarily put to \noptimal productive use, the farming households also developed pessimism towards the \nrole  of  the Department  of  Agriculture,  so  lesser  cooperation  can  be  expected  for  future \nprojects such as training in sustainable agriculture.  \n\nParticipatory  econometric  modeling  was  also  done  by  Rao  and  Ibanez  (2005)  for  a \nsocial fund in Jamaica. The authors concluded that although the funds do not necessarily \naddress  the  perceived  needs  of  the  stakeholders,  as  project  completion  approaches, \nsatisfaction  of  outcomes  increases.  The  causal  impact  of  social  funds  is  traced  to  go \nbeyond  the  usual  economic  outcomes  and  extend  towards  improvement  in  trust  and  in \ncollective capacity building.  \n\nFurther on participation, DasGupta et al. (2004) emphasized the diversity of settings \nin  the  attainment  of  institutional  changes.  This  diversity  requires  the  tailor-fitting  of \ninterventions at the community level in fostering attainment of development targets. The \nauthors  pointed  out  that  the  state  and  community  should  interact  to  be able  to  achieve \nthis, illustrating the real meaning of participation. \n\n4 \n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \n\nThe dynamics in a typical rural community are an irony between simplicity in rural life \nand the complexity of the economic system that is operating. The literature offers diverse \ntheories  and  perspectives  in  trying  to  explain  the  rural  economy.  There  seems  to  be  a \ncycle over the years among these theories, postulated, reinvented, reformulated, refuted \nin some cases, and emerging again in recent literature. Lewis (1984) postulated that in \nthe  rural  economy,  growth  is  triggered  by  the  initiation  of  trade.  Farmers  are  producing \nnot  just  for  consumption  but  also  for  the  demand  in  other  communities.  This  is  a  valid \nassumption once productivity had exceeded the threshold for local needs. Otherwise, if \nproduction level is still below the threshold, marginalization and subsequent exposure to \nvulnerability  will  dominate  rural  production  with  growth  hardly  manifesting,  if  not \nremaining impossible. Intensive intervention will be needed to push the farmers initially to \ncross  the  threshold  for  growth.  Growth  will  naturally  push  economic  activities  towards \ndiversity  at  the  community  level  and  possibly  (but  not  necessarily)  specialization  at  the \nhousehold level.  \n\nIn  a  growing  rural  economy,  households  cannot  be  competitive  if  they  refuse  to \nspecialize.  Given  the  limited  technologies  available  to  them  (agriculture  and  non-\nagriculture),  specialization  will  help  maximize  production  in  the  light  of  economies  of \nscale.  As  an  example,  a  specific  industry  for  microenterprise  development  (non-\nagriculture),  specific  crops  requiring  special  farming  systems  (and  technology)  for \nagriculture,  or  even  specialization  of  services  offered  in  a  diversifying  economic \nthat  area. \nenvironment,  will  continue \nSpecialization  will  stimulate  efficiency  in  rural  production  and  possibly  curtail  certain \nfactors  of  production  (in  the  hope  of  attaining  efficiency).  Among  the  factors  of \n\ntheir  competitive  advantage \n\nto  raise \n\nin \n\n15 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nproduction,  labor  is  easily  substituted  through  the  choice  of  appropriate  technology, \nresulting in the displacement of many rural workers. This phenomenon was observed in \nthe rural Philippines, which has been experiencing rural-urban migration for the past two \ndecades or so. A sizeable proportion of labor migration spills over to other countries. In \nthe  desire  for  market  efficiency,  specialization  can  actually  lead  towards  inequality \nbecause of the unequal utility values placed on different production activities. As Lewis \n(1984)  points  out,  market  efficiency  is  not  the  way  to  reach  equilibrium  in  an  agrarian \neconomy; rather, it trades some social costs for gains in trade to serve as an engine of \nrural  communities. \ngrowth.  The  solution  proposed \nEmpowerment  can  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and \ncapacity building. The framework that this study will be based upon revolves around the \ncomplementation  of  infrastructure  and  capacity  building  in  forging  a  path  towards  rural \ndevelopment. \n\nis  empowerment  of \n\nthen \n\nThe  initial  role  of  the  government  is  neither  regulation  nor  governance  but \nempowerment of local communities, similar to the paradigm proposed by the World Bank \nin  poverty  alleviation.  Empowerment  is  defined  in  this  paradigm  as  \u201cthe  expansion  of \nassets and capabilities of poor people to participate in, negotiate with, influence, control, \nand  hold  accountable  institutions  that  affect  their  lives\u201d  (Narayan,  2002,  pp.  13\u201314). \nFocusing  on  empowerment  in  the  framework, market  efficiencies  can  be  gradually \nattained  since  this  will  help  in  narrowing  the  information  asymmetries  among  the \nstakeholders (the suppliers, the traders, the market/retailers, and the producers/farmers). \nThe  empowered  stakeholders  would  like  to  gain  access  to  pertinent  information  before \nthey  make  specific  decisions.  Rural  roads,  other  rural  infrastructure,  and  capacity-\nbuilding  activities  will  enable  all  the  stakeholders  to  access  relevant  information  of  the \nsupply-demand  chains  for  rural/agricultural  goods  and  services.  The  stakeholders  can \nuse such information in the efficient allocation of factors of production.  \n\nIn  the  process,  the  government  needs  to  facilitate  the  dynamics  where  the \nstakeholders  interact  towards  attainment  of  efficiency.  For  certain  interventions  like \ncredit, direct provision of say seed capital may be provided by the government or can be \ntaken  from  some  other  forms  of  development  assistance.  This  is  also  true  for  other \ninfrastructure where the initial construction will need money that is beyond the capability \nof  the  stakeholders.  It  is  important  though  to  consider  that  rural  infrastructure  does  not \nfollow similar protocol as in mainstream public economics where cost and maintenance \nwill have to be secured from the beneficiaries through the process of taxation. Many of \nthe  rural  beneficiaries  in  developing  countries fall  short  of the  cut-off  of  taxable  income \nbrackets.  However,  direct  provision  should  not  be  continuously  done;  the  government \nand  donors  will  have  to  veer  away  from  direct  provision  and  focus  on  facilitation  to \nstimulate the participatory environment leading towards sustainability. It is important for \nthe  stakeholders  to  establish  ownership,  so  it  is  important  to  encourage  them  to \ncontribute  (in  cash  or  in  kind)  in  maintenance  to  safeguard  the  sustainability  plan  that \nshould be part of the design of the intervention. The notion of a user\u2019s fee is difficult to \ninculcate  among  the  stakeholders  especially  because  they  have  limited  income  and \nlivelihood  opportunities.  A  good  advocacy  strategy  though  will  help  rural  stakeholders \nand they will eventually accept the concept of user\u2019s fee. \n\nIn  Section  4.5,  models  will  be  developed  to  understand  the  dynamics  in  the  rural \neconomy. A model for a household that would like to maximize its welfare function will be \nformulated  taking  into  consideration  spatial  dimension.  The  spatial  dimension  will \nrationalize site-specific packaging of bundles of intervention. A stochastic frontier model \n(basically  a  production  frontier)  will  also  be  developed  with  spatial  dimensions.  The \nspatial  dimension  is  justified  in  terms  of  soil  fertility  and  diversity  of  economic  activities \ndetermined  by  topography,  among  others.  This  model  will  help  explain  how  inequality \n\n16 \n\n\f \n\n \n\namong  the  rural  households  can  be  traced  to  how  efficient/inefficient  they  are  in \naccessing the factors of production available to them.  \n\n4.1  ROLE OF RURAL ROADS \n\nA  rural  road  will  be  defined  as  an  access  from  the  main  road  network  to  the  rural \ncommunities  and/or  production  areas.  It  is  intended  to  provide  an  access  path  for \nindividuals residing in rural communities and as passage for light public vehicles carrying \npeople  and/or  produce.  Transportation  cost  can  be  reduced  because  vehicles  carrying \nfarm loads will be cheaper than the human carriers that are still used whenever there is \nno such road, as in many rural areas of the Philippines.  \n\nFarm  roads  are  often  constructed  as  dirt  pavement,  or  are  topped  with  gravel, \nasphalt,  or  very  seldom,  concrete  (see  Figure  4.1).  Usually,  only  people  and  light \nvehicles  pass  through,  but  during  harvest  season,  the  local  government  or  some \ncommunity organization may upgrade it so that haulers can reach as close as possible to \nthe  production  areas.  The  main  road  network,  called  national  roads  in  the  Philippines, \nare usually constructed with concrete materials and are wider. Thus, they accommodate \nheavy-duty  haulers  that  will  collect  the  produce  and  bring  them  to  the  main  distribution \ndepot (which is government or privately owned). \n\nFigure 4.1 Typical Rural Road in the Philippines \n\n \n\nThe  path  of  rural  development  from  the  improvement  of  accessibility  in  the  rural \ncommunities will start from the known direct impact of rural roads. Roads are intended to \nmitigate the state of isolation of an area\u2014isolation that is a hindrance to the initiation of \nvarious facets of development. Improved access roads among the rural households will \nbring  increased  accessibility  and  movement  because  of  lower  transportation  costs, \nincreasing  economic  activities.  The  literature  provide  a  wide  range  of  percentage \nreduction in transportation cost as a result of putting up new or improving existing rural \nroads. Regardless of the amount of input infused, rural roads are expected to contribute \nto lowering transportation cost. \n\nImprovement  in  road  networks  starts  up  the  feedback  system  of  input  procurement \nand  marketing  of  produce.  The  producers  are  expected  to  pay  less  for  the  inputs  of \nproduction  because  of  the  improvement  in  accessibility;  this  lower  cost  increases  the \nproducers\u2019  capability  to  procure  more  inputs.  The  different  suppliers  of  inputs  will  lose \ntheir existing monopolies and be forced to become competitive because the farmers will \nhave  alternative  sources.  Marketing  will  no  longer  be  limited  to  a  few  traders;  a \n\n17 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nnegotiable pricing system will be created because transportation cost reduction will open \nthe  ceiling  of  price  negotiations.  This  is  of  course  based  on  the  assumption  that \ncommodity  financing  (usually  associated  with  price  ceiling  of  goods  and  being  unfair  to \nfarmers)  is  no  longer  practiced  or  that  there  is  a  sustainable  credit  facility  in  place. \nKnowledge  of  the  marketing  avenues  and  the  demand  for  various  commodities  (to  be \nfacilitated  by  the  government)  will  encourage  farmers\u2019  diversification  of  crops  and  later \non, to their specializing in high valued crops that are viable only in the production area \n(efficiency).  Thus,  increased  production  and  increased  gross  value  coupled  with  lower \ninput cost will benefit the farmers in terms of increased earnings.  \n\nImproved  accessibility  will  also  facilitate  provision  of  basic  social  services  like \neducation and health. Even if such services are not brought right into the community, it \nwill  be  easier  for  the  households  to  access  those  from  the  town  centers  or  in  another \ncommunity.  Social  services  should  result  in  enhancement  of  human  capital  and  along \nwith  other  capacity-building  interventions,  should  contribute  to  empowering  the  rural \ncommunity.  \n\nRural  roads  will  also  generate  multiplier  effects.  Foremost,  they  serve  as  a  catalyst \nfor  greater  public  investment  into  infrastructure  and  capacity  building.  An  improved \naccess  road  will  facilitate  the  construction  of  a  health  center  (and  visits  of  health \nprofessionals),  a  warehouse  for  agricultural  commodities,  and  even  the  conducting  of \ntrainings  and  other  capacity-building  activities. Provision  of  other  physical  infrastructure \nwill be made feasible with easy transport of materials. Then for those positions manned \nby  personnel  from  outside  the  community,  or  for  capacity  building  where  resource \npersons come from outside, traveling into the community will be viable and less time will \nbe spent in transit to the site. \n\nThe improved mobility of the households will expose them to outside communities. In \nthis exposure, they may observe prototype development that will serve as a stimulus for \ntheir desire to realize similar development in their locality. This desire will then foster a \ngood motivating factor for them to participate in the process of identification of strategies \nthat can lead towards development. This is the start of community building that will later \non evolve into a sustainable backbone.  \n\nWith  the  growing  demand  for  infrastructure,  demand  for  support  services  will  also \nincrease,  requiring  more  participation  on  the  part  of  the  household  in  planning  and  in \nsourcing for infrastructure and support services. This will stimulate the local government \nto contribute specifically for sustainability of the infrastructure and support services.  \n\nImproved  accessibility  among  farmers  (leading  to  reduction  in  transportation  cost) \nbrings  viable  input  sourcing  at  reasonable  cost.  Furthermore,  better  post-production \nhandling will result in lower post-production losses, yielding a good profit margin for the \nfarmers.  \n\nFor  the  non-agricultural  household,  the  direct  impact  of  roads  will  be  in  terms  of \nfacilitating the emergence of new investments and new enterprises. Eventually, there will \nbe  greater  diversity  in  the  livelihoods  available  to  them.  This  diversity  is  an  important \nmanifestation of rural development.  \n\nThe complementation between increased production among farming households and \nthe  non-farming  households  engaged  in  microenterprise  development  are  early  leads \ntowards  rural  development.  In  rural  areas  where  employment  opportunities  should \nextend  beyond  the  traditional  agriculture  basis,  the  empowered  households  that \n\n18 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nparticipate in programs will benefit not just the individual households, but will strengthen \nthe entire community as well, contributing to sustainability.  \n\n4.2  RURAL DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTS \n\nAccording to the National Economic and Development Authority and the World Bank \n(NEDA-WB,  2003),  rural  development  is  considered  to  manifest  from  the  presence  of \nthree ingredients: social infrastructure, physical infrastructure, and financial services. The \nfundamental rural development paradigm is summarized in the following: \n\nEconomic \n\nWell \nBeing \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nSocial                                              Environmental \n\nRural  development  results  from  the  improvement  of  the  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental conditions of the community. These three aspects complement each other \nand lead towards the overall improvement of individual and community well being.  \n\nThe  rural  development  and  living  condition  scale  and  data  used  in  this  study  come \nfrom (NEDA-WB-ASEM, 2005). A Likert scale is used to assess the perception of rural \nhouseholds  on  the  different  aspects  of  living  conditions,  including  18  items  distributed \namong  the  different  facets  of  living  conditions. The  scale  was  adopted  from  NEDA-WB \n(2003),  which  pilot-tested,  validated  and  improved  the  instrument.  Another  Likert  scale \nwas also used to assess the perception of rural stakeholders on the different aspects of \nrural development, including 13 items distributed among the different constructs of rural \ndevelopment.  In  addition  to  the  validation  done  in  NEDA-WB  (2003),  the  scale  was \nvalidated  further  in  NEDA-WB-ASEM  (2005)  to  ensure  data  quality.  The  details  of  data \ncollection strategies are given in Section 4.4.1.  \n\n4.3 \n\nIMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PERCEPTIONS \n\nImpact assessment, participation, and perceptions have become integral elements in \nstrategic  development  planning.  Assessing  the  impact  of  similar  past  interventions  can \nprovide valuable lessons on what is effective and what is not, so that the mistakes of the \npast will not be repeated. Participation and involvement of beneficiaries ensures that the \nintervention  planned  to  be  implemented  matches  their  needs.  Perceptions  provide  a \nquick  yardstick  for  development  planners  on  the  possible/potential  impact  of  an \nintervention. This proximate measure is a fast alternative to waiting for the quantitatively \nmeasurable indicators of rural development, which usually manifest after a mid- to long-\nterm period. Because the beneficiaries are the ones who will receive the outcomes, it is \nonly appropriate that planners incorporate their perceptions into the plans of intervention. \nParticipation and social preparation have become integral pre- and post-activities of rural \ndevelopment intervention strategies. \n\nHere is a statement that further contributes to issues of participation and perception: \nthe views of the stakeholders are considered valuable insights on the accomplishments \n\n19 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nof  interventions  of  programs  implemented,  especially  in  rural  areas  (NEDA-WB-ASEM, \n2005). While international comparability is easily guaranteed among assessments based \non numerical yardsticks, the utility of such measures in the development of strategies for \ntargeted  interventions  is  limiting.  Furthermore,  participatory  assessment  has  been \nconsidered  as  part  of  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  programs  (PRSP)  in  many \ndeveloping  countries.  The  development  of  subsequent  interventions  (follow  through) \nshould  be  tailored  to  the  stakeholder  needs  following  their  perceptions  on  what  is \neffective for them. This could guarantee the acceptability of strategies and mechanisms \nof  intervention  in  a  much  shorter  time  period,  ensuring  sustainability  of  the  initial  gains \nthat  may  have  been  achieved  by  the  predecessor  project,  parallel  to  the  success  of \ndevelopment  projects  that  are  backed  with  ample  social  preparations.  Resource  and \npublic economics has similarly gained benefits from using contingent valuation methods \nthat basically derive information from the perceptions by stakeholders in imputing prices \nand costs of non-traded goods and services. \n\nThe literature also includes the work of various authors on modelling with inputs from \ndata on beneficiaries\u2019 perception. As an example, Prokopy (2005) measured outcome in \nterms of household satisfaction, equity in access, and saved time (from water collection) \nin a water system project. The thrust of decentralization was argued by Asthana (2003) \nas an element of participation, that public services provided by those closer to the people \nare more appealing. \u201cParticipatory\u201d econometric modeling was done by Rao and Ibanez \n(2005)  for  a  social  fund  in  Jamaica;  they  concluded  that  although  the  funds  do  not \nnecessarily  address \ntowards  project \ncompletion,  satisfaction  of  outcomes  increases.  This  is  especially  true  among  social \nfunds because it is expected that social order must be restored before economic gains \nwill  manifest.  Participation  was  further  pushed  by  DasGupta,  et.  al  (2004),  who \nemphasized the diversity of settings in the attainment of institutional changes, therefore \nrequiring the tailoring of interventions to the needs/demand of beneficiaries. \n\nthe  perceived  needs  of \n\nthe  stakeholders, \n\n4.4  DATA SOURCES \n\nData  coming  from  two  surveys  will  be  used  in  the  empirical  investigation  of  the \nmodels  presented  below.  The  client  satisfaction  survey  is  one  time  point  (cross-\nsectional) data collected in 2005 where the unit of analysis is the household. The Family \nIncome and Expenditure Surveys (FIES) have households as the unit of analysis. Public \nuse files (PUF) of these surveys are available for 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, \nand 2003, but concepts and sampling design have evolved over the years. The design \nand domain in 2003 are different from those of the previous years. Thus, only the cross-\nsection for 2003 will be used in the analysis. \n\n4.4.1  Client Satisfaction Survey \n\nThe  Client  Satisfaction  Survey  was  commissioned  by  the  World  Bank  in  2005 \n(NEDA-WB-ASEM,  2005)  to  develop  a  perception-based  survey  that  will  facilitate  the \nverification  of  the  effect  of  the  outputs  of  the  rural  sector  agencies  (Department  of \nAgriculture,  Department  of  Agrarian  Reform,  and  Department  of  Environment  and \nNatural  Resources)  on  rural  development  in  the  Philippines.  A  rural  development  and \nliving  condition  scale  (see  Appendix  1)  was  developed  and  pilot-tested  several  times \n[see (NEDA-WB-ASEM, 2005) and (NEDA-WB, 2003)]. It was concluded that the scale \ncan  approximate  the  constructs  of  rural  development.  The  survey  was  implemented  in \npurposively  selected  barangays  (villages)  where  households  were  then  randomly \nselected.  In  the  purposive  selection  of  the  barangays,  prototype  interventions  of  the \ndepartments  were  considered,  along  with  an  appropriate  control  group  (no  known \nintervention from the government in recent years). For the government interventions, the \nstrata were defined in terms of whether the project was locally or foreign funded for each \n\n20 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nof the three major departments working in the rural sector (agriculture, agrarian reform, \nand  environment  and  natural  resources).  The  delineation  between  local  and  foreign \nfunding  serves  as  a  proximate  indicator  of  the  intensity  of  resources  used  in \nimplementing  the  project,  where  resources  from  local  sources  are  usually  lesser  than \nthose coming from foreign sources. The control group was also distributed according to \nexpected  income  level  (low,  medium,  high  income),  by  topography  (upland,  coastal \nareas),  and  according  to  the  Kalaban  Laban  Sa  Kahirapan-Comprehensive  Integrated \nDelivery  of  Social  Service  (KALAHI-CIDSS)  sites  (a  government  project  using  an \nintegrated  strategy  of  facilitating  rather  than  direct  provisions;  it  uses  a  participatory \napproach  rather  than  imposing  appropriate  interventions).  More  than  6,000  households \nwere included in the database. Only rural barangays were included. \n\n4.4.2  Family Income and Expenditure Survey \n\nThe Family Income and Expenditures Survey (FIES) is conducted every three years \nby  the  Philippine  National  Statistics  Office  (PNSO).  It  is  a  probability  sample  of  about \n20,000  households  with  rural-urban  areas  of  the  provinces  as  domains  (until  2000).  In \n2003,  the  domain  was  raised  to  the  regions  and  sample  size  raised  to  42,000.  More \ndetailed information was collected. This survey\u2019s unit of analysis is also the households, \nbut in contrast to the information from the Client Satisfaction Survey, long-term outcomes \nare  collected.  Transportation  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  indicator  of  road  system \nimprovement.  \n\n4.5  HOUSEHOLD MODEL \n\nConsider a household utility function where profit is indicated by realized or perceived \nrural  development  constructs.  For  perception  on  rural  development  constructs,  two \napproaches will be considered: a dichotomous (presence-absence of rural development) \none and an index developed from the rural development scale.  \n\nIn  a  universal,  unregulated  intervention,  those  with  more  resources  (e.g.,  land  or \neducation) will  benefit more.  This  is  called leakage  of  intervention  in poverty  alleviation \nstrategies, where some intended beneficiaries were not reached while those who do not \ntechnically need the intervention actually benefited. In rural communities, such a leakage \nis  very  likely  to  occur  especially  when  the  marginalized  sectors  are  still  in  the \nempowerment  process.  As  an  example,  consider  a  capacity-building  program  such  as \nlivelihood  training.  Those  who  have  higher  education  will  have  a  good  chance  of \nappreciating the training and have the capability to apply it. They are also likely to have \nmoney  for  capital  or  may  have  easier  access  to  credit.  Unless  a  complementing  credit \nprogram  is  offered,  the  more  affluent  will  do  better  but  the  marginalized  will  remain \nmarginalized,  the  income  gap  will  expand,  and  the  program  will  result  in  increased \ninequality  among  the  rural  households.  This  is  also  true  even  within  the  farming \nsegment.  In  an  irrigation  project,  the  farmers  would  usually  queue  for  their  farm  to  get \nirrigation water. A farmer whose cultivated area is large will practically take most of the \nservice  time  of  the  irrigation  because  he  needs  it.  This  may  also  result  in  greater \ninequality  because  by  the  time  the  small  farmers  access  the  service  their  paddies  are \nalready dried up, leaving them with damaged crops and an even lower income.  \n\nGiven the natural conditions in a rural economy and the enhancements introduced by \nthe  development  assistance  (infrastructure  and  support  services),  the  households  want \nto  optimize  their  benefits.  The  household  dynamics  aim  to  optimize  their  benefits \nresulting in improvement of their well-being. Such dynamics are summarized into a utility \nfunction defined as follows: \n\n \nFor the ith household, define \n\n21 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nUi = utility value for the ith household, which can be defined as  \n\n=\n\niu\n\nif\n  ,0\n\n   ,1\n\u23a7\n\u23a8\n\u23a9\n\n they \notherwise\n\nrural\n \ndevelopmen\nt\n          \n     \nor ui = rural development index derived from the rural development scale; \n\nperceived\n          \n\n that ther\n          \n\n is e\n          \n\n          \n\n \n\nDi = demographic profile of the household; \nPi  =  extent  of  actual  or  perceived  participation  of  the  household  in  community \nactivities or in maintenance of infrastructure (in cash, in kind, or willingness to \ncontribute in maintenance); \n\n1\niI =  indicator  variable  that  the  household  perceived  that  there  is  an  available \ninfrastructure/intervention  that  is  needed  in  generating  farm  or  non-farm \nincome; \n\n2\niI =  indicator  variable  that  the  household  perceived  that  there  is  an  available \ninfrastructure/intervention  but  this  is  not  needed  in  generating  farm  or  non-\nfarm income; \n\n3\niI =  indicator  variable  that  the  household  did  not  perceive  availability  of  an \ninfrastructure/intervention  that  is  needed  in  generating  farm  or  non-farm \nincome; \n\nFi = factor intensity for farming activities, e.g., farm area, access to credit, farming \n\nsystems; \n\nNFi = factor intensity for non-farm livelihood, e.g., age of the household head; \nXi = income from farming activity; \nZi = income from non-farming activity; \nYi = total household income; and \nwi = a measure of spatial distance. \n\nfor  the  dichotomous  case, \n\ni\u03c0 = (\n\n)iuE\n\n for  the  continuous  case,  and \n\nLet \n\ni\u03c0 =\n\n(\nuP\n=\ni\n(\nuP\n\u2212\n\ni\n\n)\n1\n)1\n=\n\n1\n\nassuming linear contribution of the factors, for a household with farming activity, \n(\n)\n1\nF\n+\n\u03b2\n4\ni\n)\n1\n+\n\u03b4\u00b5\n\n1\n1\n\u03b2\u03b2\u03c0\n1\n0\n(\n21\nFI\n\u03b2\n7\ni\ni\n\n)\n(\n2\n11\nFI\n+\n\u03b2\u00b5\n6\ni\ni\n\n)\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b2\u00b5\n5\n\n1\ni\n      \n\nD\ni\n\u2212\n\n\u00b5\n1\n\nF\ni\n\nP\ni\n\nX\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n=\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n \n\n1\n\n1\n\ni\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n1\n1\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n2\n3\n)\n(\n31\n1\nFI\nw\n\u2212\n\u03b2\u00b5\n8\n1\ni\ni\ni\n(\n1\n1\nIFXPDf=\n,\nor \n\u03c0\ni\ni\n\n1\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n1\ni\n\n,\n\nI\n\n2\ni\n\n,\n\n1\n3\nwI\n,\ni\ni\n\n;\n\n)1\n2\n,\n\u03b4\u03b2\n\n. \n\nSimilarly, for a household with non-farming activity, \n\n=\n\n+\n\n2\ni\n      \n\n2\n2\n\u03b2\u03b2\u03c0\n1\n0\n(\n2\nNF\n\u03b2\n7\ni\n\n\u2212\n\n2\ni\n\nD\ni\n\nI\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n2\n\u03b2\n3\nI\n\n3\ni\n\nZ\n(\n\n+\n\n2\n\u03b2\n2\n\nP\ni\n)\n2\n\u2212\n\u03b2\u00b5\n8\n2\n2\nor \n\u03c0\ni\n\n+\n\ni\nNF\ni\n(\n2\n\n2\n\u03b2\n4\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n(\nNF\ni\n)\n2\n+\n\u03b4\u00b5\n\n2\n,\n\n2\n2\nw\ni\n1\ni\n\nIFXPDf=\n,\ni\n\n,\n\n,\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n,\n\nI\n\n2\ni\n\n,\n\n3\n2\nwI\n,\ni\ni\n\n;\n\n)2\n2\n,\n\u03b4\u03b2\n\n. \n\n)\n2\n\u2212\n\u03b2\u00b5\n5\n\n(\n\nNF\ni\n\n\u2212\n\n\u00b5\n2\n\n2\n\n)\n\n+\n\n2\n\u03b2\n6\n\nI\n\n2\ni\n\n(\n\nNF\ni\n\n\u2212\n\n\u00b5\n2\n\n)\n\n \n\nRemarks: \n\n1.  The  quadratic  and  centered  terms  on  Fi  and  NFi  are  intended  to  account  for  a \nthreshold effect of farm and non-farm inputs. Because of the natural constraints in \nrural areas, the effect of inputs on utility begins to taper as input increases further \nafter  it  has  crossed  a  certain  threshold.  As  an  example,  given  farm  size, \nproduction increases proportionately to farm size, but once it crosses the agrarian \nreform  program  threshold  (e.g.,  7  hectares  in  the  Philippines),  the  utility  of  the \nhousehold will start to taper off because they have to turn over excess land to the \nprogram.  Consider  education:  initially,  as  education  increases,  higher  non-farm \nincome  may  be  expected,  but  as  education  increases  further,  that  will  become \nredundant,  exceeding  the  level  needed  in  the  area,  so  utility  is  expected  to \ndiminish afterwards. \n\n22 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2. \n\n1\niI  is  a  perfect  match  of  supply  and  demand  for  development  intervention  that \n3\n2\niI  are mismatches and are therefore \niI  and \ncan result in increasing utility, while \nexpected to yield negative effects. Something being available and perceived not \nto be needed will stimulate the stakeholders to ask questions about prioritization \nof interventions, threatening their perceived utility. The same is true for something \nperceived to be needed but not being available. \n\n3.  The  last  term  accounts  for  spatial  dependence  indexed  by \n\niw (e.g., \naverage  perceived  utility  in  the  community).  The  stimulus  of  some  utility \nperception  for  a  household  in  the  community  can  also  be  realized  by  other \nhouseholds  in  the  same  community.  This  term  allows  later  on  the  empirical \nverification of the advantage of targeted, site-specific intervention over universal \nintervention that usually results in leakage among non-target beneficiaries.  \n\niw and \n\n1\n\n2\n\n4.  The  spatial  component  of  the  model  postulated  as  an  autoregression  may  also \naccount for the long-term, cumulative effect of the determinants. This serves as a \nproximate  measure  of  the  lag  effect  of  some  indicators  in  the  absence  of  panel \ndata that would facilitate the explicit estimation of the effect. \n\n5.  Rural roads and other infrastructure like irrigation need not be treated in the same \nway  as  ordinary  public  goods  where  maintenance  and  initial  investments  are \nexpected  to  be  recovered  in  a  taxation  system.  Among  the  rural  households  in \nthe  Philippines  for  instance,  a  significant  majority  earn  income  far  below  the \nminimum  taxable  level.  Therefore,  rural  infrastructure  should  be  maintained \nthrough a user\u2019s fee system alongside the support of other stakeholders like the \nlocal government.  \n\n  \n\nFor  the  ith  household,  the  total  odds  of  having  perceived  that  there  is  rural \n\u2264\u2264 \u03bb .

The constraint is attained \nwhen  non-farm  income  increases  while  farm  income  is  low.  Both  the  expansion  in \nfarm  and  non-farm  incomes  can  be  realized  whenever  the  intervention  package  is \nbundled so that the pre-requisite factors of farm production and skills and capital for \nnon-farm  income  generation  can  be  efficiently  utilized.  A  household  that  may  opt  to \nconcentrate  on  farm  production  can  produce  optimally  (as  supported  by  the \ninterventions).  This  is  also  true  for  a  household  that  has  the  skills  to  generate  non-\nfarm  income.  All  households  are  expected  to  expand  income  and  other  utility \nbenefits, hence reducing income disparity.  \n\nThe  first\u2013order  conditions  for  optimality  of  the  utility  function  can  be  derived  by \n\nforming the Lagrangian function L(.), and subsequent optimization. \n\n4.5.1  \u201cNon-Poor\u201d Households \n\nThe  non-poor  here  are  those  households  with  income  larger  than  the  threshold  z. \nAmong  this  segment  of  the  population,  the  inequality-averse  constraint  will  not  take \neffect in utility optimization if FGT is used. In FGT, only the income of the \u201cpoor\u201d segment \nis included in the computation. \n\nContribution of Participation \n\nThe first-order condition for optimality of utility subject to the constraint and \n+\n\nidentity equation is \n\n)[\n2\n2\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\n2\n2\n\n[\n1\n1\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\n2\n2\n\n] 0\n=\n\n(\n1\n\u2212+\n\n. \n\n+\n\n]\n\nThe condition can be satisfied in two cases: (i) participation affects neither utility nor \nincome from both farming and non-farming sources or (ii) participation affects utility and \nincome function in opposite directions. Case 1 is easily satisfied if intervention is still in \nthe early stage of community building. The stakeholders may not yet be able to realize \nthe  effect  of  participation  on  their  utility  or  on  their  income.  In  case  2,  utility  will  most \nlikely  benefit  positively  from  participation,  being  a  common  objective/target  in  any \ncommunity building activity. While they perceive better utility, participation may result in \nlower  income  initially  because  stakeholders  allocate  less  time  for  their  production \nactivities,  or  because  they  allot  a  portion  of  earnings  for  the  maintenance  of  the \ninfrastructure.  However,  this  is  not  expected  to  hold  in  the  long-term.  As  participation \nbecomes  prevalent  in  that  community,  a  model  shift  will  occur  or  the  effect  of \nparticipation will longer be distinguishable because everybody will be participating. \n\nContribution of Availability of the Needed Intervention \n\n1\niI ),  the  first-order  condition  is \n\nFor  the  infrastructure/intervention  perceived  to  be  available  and  needed  in  the \n] 0\n[\n1\n. \ncommunity  (\n\u03b2\u03bb\n=\n6\nTo  satisfy  the  condition,  there  are  also  two  cases:  (i)  farming  and  non-farming  factors \nexceeded  the  threshold  or  (ii)  farming  and  non-farming  factors  do  not  exceed  the \nthreshold.  In  case  1,  access  to  the  infrastructure/intervention  will  push  income  to  grow \nbut  will  not necessarily  be  accompanied  by  utility  improvement.

Thus, the \npoor  are  expected  to  manifest  neither  income  nor  utility  improvement  as  a  result  of \nparticipation.  Unlike  the  non-poor  who  may  already  exhibit  growth  in  utility  perception, \nthe poor are expected to have income decline as a result of the time and money lost due \nto participation. That rate of deceleration in income should not pull away the low-income \nhouseholds from the threshold (z); otherwise, the objective function will not be optimized. \nA  more  intensive  advocacy  campaign  will  be  needed  so  that  the  poor  will  able  to \nappreciate  the  effect  of  participation  later,  and  will  not  focus  only  on  the  immediate \n(unfavorable) consequence.  \n\nContribution of Availability of the Needed Intervention \n\nFor  the  infrastructure/intervention  perceived  to  be  present  and  needed  in  the \nis \n\nthe  poor  households \n\n), \n\n(\n\ncommunity \n]\n[\n)\n1\n\u03b2\u03bb\n6\n\n\u00b5\n1\n\nF\ni\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n(\n1\n\u2212+\n\n1\niI\n[\n)\n2\n\u03b2\u03bb\n6\n\n(\n\nNF\ni\n\n\u2212\n\nthe \n]\n)\n\n\u00b5\n2\n\n+\n\nfirst-order  condition  among \n\u03b4\nnz\n\n[\n2\n\u03b1\u03b1\n+\n4\n\n] 0\n=\n\n. \n\n1\n4\n\nThe  poor  households  will  most  likely  have  farming  and  non-farming  resources  that \nare lower than the corresponding threshold. The optimal solution then implies that such \nneeded  intervention  perceived  to  be  available  contributes  directly  to  income  increase \n(both  farm  and  non-farm).  In  this  case,  agricultural  infrastructure  like  rural  roads, \nirrigation,  post-harvest  facilities,  and  even  capacity-building  activities  will  have  direct \ncontributions.  On  the  other  hand,  the  non-farming  amenities  would  also  include  roads \n\n25 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nprimarily, since they can stimulate trade and hence the growth of new economic activities \nleading  to  the  expansion  of  rural  livelihood.  Livelihood  training  programs,  credit,  and \nmicroenterprise development will also have direct effects on non-farm income increase. \nTherefore  among  the  poor  households,  the  intervention  to  be  implemented  should  be \ncarefully chosen so that it will have direct benefit to them, and the utility function will be \noptimized effectively. Participatory project identification will help in this case. \n\nContribution of Mismatched Intervention \n\nThe same effect of mismatched intervention as in the non-poor described in Section \n\n4.5.1 is expected among the poor households. \n\n4.5.3  Other Implications \n \n\nThe  perceived  need  and  availability  for  rural  infrastructure  and  other  interventions \nyield varying effects for the groups above and below a specific income threshold. For the \nnon-poor, access to infrastructure will increase perceptions of income but not necessarily \nof utility, as they may already have higher expectations. The poor, on the other hand, will \nbenefit  in  terms  of  perceived  utility improvement  that  is  not necessarily  associated with \nincome increase. \n\nTo  prevent  further  income  disparities  among  the  rural  households,  the  views  of  the \npoor on the kind of project should be weighted more than those of the non-poor, who will \ngenerally  benefit  more.  To  help  maximize  utility  and  minimize  income  disparities, \ninfrastructure or interventions should be chosen so that they will have direct immediate \nimpact on the poor.  \n\nThose  with  lower  production  capacities  should  be  able  to  access  non-farm  sources \nlike  participation  in  trainings  or  road  access  in  order  to  avert  inequality  in  income  and \nmaximize  their  utility.  This  can  be done  through  a  screening  process for  participants  of \ntrainings  and  application  of  a  user\u2019s  fee  based  on  the  ability  to  pay  for  physical \ninfrastructure.  Households  that  are assessed  as  being  capable  of paying  will have  less \nincentive  to  avail  infrastructure,  say,  irrigation  service.  They  will  then  procure  their  own \nirrigation,  say  an  underground  water  irrigation  type,  therefore  allowing  more  marginal \nhouseholds access to the irrigation system. The intervention would thus settle among the \ntargeted  beneficiaries.  On  the  assumption  that  the  local  government  unit  is  really \nconcerned  about  the  services  they  will  deliver,  they  will  also  have  a  utility  function  that \ncan  be  maximized  when  the  households  are  satisfied  with  services,  i.e.,  when  the \ntrainings/infrastructure becomes \u201csustainable.\u201d \n\nAmong agrarian reform communities, those who are efficiently collecting user\u2019s fees \nare  more  developed.  Even  in  some  social  fund  recipient  areas  in  the  Southern \nPhilippines,  road  user\u2019s  fees  are  collected  using  methods  similar  to  economic  rent  for \nnatural  resources.  Regular  nonpayment  of  user\u2019s  fees,  for  example  irrigation  dues,  will \nresult in curtailment of their privilege for their farm to be irrigated. Anything free is always \nviewed  to  be  beneficial.  Credit  has  always  been  perceived  to  be  a  dole  out  strategy. \nHowever, there is already a growing realization among the stakeholders that there is no \nsuch  thing  as  a  free  lunch.  There  is  an  emerging  paradigm  shift  from  direct  provision \n(favorable  to  politicians)  to  facilitation  (sustainable)  of  access  to  various  development \namenities. When the role of the national government gradually shifts towards facilitation, \nthe  only  way  to  sustain  the  project  is  to  let  the  stakeholders  participate  in  the \nmaintenance (in cash or in kind). Such participation stimulates their sense of ownership \nof the infrastructure, hence increasing the prospects of sustainability.  \n\n26 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nThe constraint then should not be imposed on utility maximization, but rather in the \nmaintenance and sustainability of the intervention. For infrastructure, a user\u2019s fee system \ncan be used not only to generate resources for maintenance, but also as an instrument \nin  averting  inequality  (or  at  least  to  prevent  it  from  further  worsening).  The  user\u2019s  fee \nsystem shall consider three factors: (i) capacity to pay\u2014this will help curb inequality, as \nthe \u201cbetter off\u201d will contribute more than the marginalized group; (ii) economic rent\u2014it is \nfair  that  those  who  benefit  more  from  an  infrastructure  will  contribute  more  for  its \nmaintenance; and (iii) willingness-to-pay\u2014this should be considered because the user\u2019s \nfee might become a disincentive to use among some beneficiaries. Willingness-to-pay is \neasily encouraged through an effective advocacy campaign.  \n\nfor \n\nThe  constraint \n\ninequality  does  not  directly \n\nthe  utility-maximizing \nhouseholds.  It  is  natural  behavior  that  when  development  intervention  in  any  form  is \navailable,  rural  households  will  take advantage  of  whatever  benefit it  may  yield.  Hymer \nand  Resnik  (1969)  pointed  out  that  inequality  in  an  agrarian  economy  can  worsen \nbecause of the increasing trade with the outside economy becoming more beneficial to a \ncertain \u201cadvantageous\u201d segment and detrimental to the marginal sector.  \n\nimpact \n\n4.5.4  Estimation \n\nThe  model  has  several  variables  and  a  good  number  are  dichotomous  (dummy) \nvariables.  Estimation  using  least  squares  may  be  affected  because  the  design-matrix \ncan become ill-conditioned. Estimates may yield reverse signs, so sensitivity analysis on \neach independent variable may not be feasible. Forecasting/prediction may still be viable, \nhowever, even when the least squares method is used in the presence of ill-conditioning \nin the design matrix.  \n\nTo resolve the potential problem caused by ill-conditioning in the design matrix, the \nbackfitting algorithm is used in the estimation. The algorithm assumes that the postulated \nmodel  is  additive,  a  generalization  of  the  linear  regression  model.  The  model  is \nexpressed as a sum of basic functions that can be linear, non-linear, or non-parametric. \nThe additive model is given by  \n\nr\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n\n1\n=\n\ny  =  \u03b1  + \n\nf\n\n(\nj x\n\nj\n\n)\n\n\u03b5+\n\n.

The total income coincides with farm \nincome  if  the  household  derives  all  income  from  farming,  non-farm  income  if  it  earns \n\n27 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nincome  from  non-farm  sources,  and  the  aggregate  of  farm  and  non-farm  income  if  it \nderives income from both sources.  \n\nThe  survey  design  imposes  constraints  in  the  choice  of  inputs  of  production  (farming) \namong  the  households.  Some  proximate  indicators  were  considered  in  lieu  of  real \nproduction  inputs  so  that  the  production  function  becomes  comprehensive.  This  will \nprovide  a  rationale  for  the  estimates  of  technical  efficiency.  The  following  inputs  of \nproduction  will  be  considered:  area  cultivated,  access  to  irrigation,  access  to  and \nutilization  of  credit  (as  proximate  indicators  of  procurement  of  farm  inputs  or  capital \navailability  for  non-farm  activities,  a  requirement  for  the  development  of  small-scale \nindustries), whether single or multiple crops are planted (proximate indicator of farming \nsystem),  health  indicator  of  household  members  (as  proximate  indicator  of  human \ncapital), number of household members with work (non-farm), and tenure of work.

The  interaction \nbetween S1 and farming inputs, and S2 with non-farming inputs will be included to ensure \nthat causation between output and production inputs are appropriate.  \n\n5 \n\nRURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT \n\nThe effect of rural infrastructure along with other determinants of production on rural \nwelfare  is  analyzed  at  the  household  level.  Household  analysis  based  on  perceptions \ncan  provide  almost  instantaneous  feedback  on  various  activities  geared  towards  rural \ndevelopment.  Causation  is  better  seen  using  perceptions  instead  of  income  measures, \nwhich  may  take  a  considerable  lag  time  before  they  exhibit  effects.  Although  income \nmanifestation  is  a  long-term  outcome,  it  should  also  be  carefully  factored  into  the \nanalysis for validation purposes. \n\n5.1 \n\nTHE RURAL PHILIPPINES \n\nThe rural population in 1990 was estimated at 53% and decreased slightly to 51.9% \nin 2000. Considering the higher population growth rate in rural areas compared to their \nurban  counterparts,  it is  imperative  to  reconcile  this  growth  rate  with  the  declining rural \npopulation.  A  common  explanation  offered  in  the  literature  for  this  discrepancy  is  the \nrural-urban  labor  migration.  During  the  period  1990\u20132000,  diversification  of  income \nsources  in  rural  areas  was  just  starting  and  very  few  non-farm  livelihood  opportunities \nwere  available.  In  2003,  the  rural  households  accounted  for  approximately  62%  of  all \nhouseholds.  Few  household  members  relocated  to  urban  areas  (temporarily)  but  the \nhouseholds  remained  in  the  rural  area.  Also  in  2003,  the  proportion  of  agriculture \nhouseholds (at least one member is in agricultural production/labor) is very low at 26%.  \n\nRural-urban  migration  may  generate  both  positive  and  negative  implications.  A \npositive effect could be that there is better road network, motivating the rural labor force \nto become more efficient in income-generation by going beyond the rural community. A \nnegative  effect  is  less  agricultural  labor  available  for  efficient  production.  Rural-urban \nmigration  may  also  obstruct  rural  development  because  those  \u201cbetter\u201d  qualified  human \ncapital  that  could  have  been  potential  conduits  for  development  are  the  ones  leaving \nrural areas. On the other hand, since some rural migrants may have less sufficient skills \n\n28 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nfor the demands of urban jobs, they might end up stagnating personally or could become \nburdens  to  the  urban  community,  which  is  already  laden  with  social  problems.  More \ninsights on rural-urban migration in the Philippines are provided by Concepcion (1978), \nDe Jong and Blair (1994), Gonzales and Pernia (1983), Pernia (1977), and Slater (1977).  \n\n5.1.1  Rural Income and Expenditures \n\nAll the variables/indicators presented here are measured at their 2003 levels. Family \nsize  is  comparable  in  rural  areas  at  4.88  to  their  urban  counterpart  of  4.75.  There  are \nmore  nuclear-type  families  in  rural  areas  (82%)  than  in  urban  ones  (75%),  a  situation \nexplained  by  the  usually  cramped  spaces  in  urban  centers  forcing  family-related \nhouseholds to live together in the same housing unit. Furthermore, more single-detached \nhousing  units  are  reported  in  rural  areas  (97%  compared  to  83%  in  urban  areas), \nexplained  by  the  difference  in  availability  of  space.  The  rural  population  is  younger, \npossibly  because  those  who  have  entered  the  labor  force  have  migrated  to  the  urban \nareas. Prevalence of an employed spouse in rural areas (36%) is similar to that in urban \nareas (37%).  \n\nIn  terms  of  amenities  and  other  living  condition  provisions,  the  rural  areas  are \ndisadvantaged with 66% having strong roof materials (88% in urban), 60% have strong \nwall materials (85% in urban), and 60% with hygienic toilet (87% in urban). Availability of \npotable water in the community is \u201crare\u201d in rural areas with 31% relative to 71% in urban \nareas. \n\nThere is no significant difference in the proportion of employed household members \nin  rural  and  urban  areas  at  42%  (note:  this  should  not  be compared  to  the  measure  of \nthe  employment  rate  because  this  proportion  is  computed  at  the  household  level). \nAlthough  a  large  proportion  of  the  rural  individuals  are  still  engaged  in  farming,  fishery \nand forestry (45%), there is evidence of gradual expansion of employment opportunities \nin other sectors with unskilled laborers (17%), operators and other skilled workers (6%), \nand  wholesale/retail  trade  (7%).  Individuals  reported  to  be  self  employed  are  high  at \n45%,  evidence  of  the  gains  from  the  efforts  towards  various  interventions  geared \ntowards  expansion  of  livelihood  in  rural  areas,  a  strategy  in  the  poverty  reduction \nprogram of the government. Employment in a private establishment is reported by 26%, \nbut this is almost doubled among their urban counterpart at 42%. A possible gap in the \nstrategy  for  rural  development  can  be  traced  to  the  development  of  private  rural \nestablishments that will contribute to the sustainability elements of rural development.  \n\nThe  total  expenditure  of  a  rural  household  is  only  47%  of  that  among  urban \nhouseholds. Given that the poverty threshold in rural areas is about 15% lower than that \nin urban areas, our earlier assessment of further inequality risk among rural households \nis supported. Although rural expenses for electricity, gas and water are only 41% of their \nurban  counterpart,  this  does  not  mean  that  these  services  are  cheaper  in  rural  areas. \nRather,  the  discrepancy  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  rural  households  are  using  these \namenities less frequently. Petroleum expenditure in rural areas, however, is 40% higher \nthan that in urban areas, a possible indicator of the accessibility problem.  \n\nLand  is  a  major  agriculture  capital  but  other  expenditures  incurred  in  some \nagricultural activities are very high as well. In crops and gardening, total expenditures are \nabout  30%  of  gross  income;  the  corresponding  amounts  in  other  activities  are  43%  in \nlivestock raising, 31% in fishing, and 27% in forestry. \n\nIn  the  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  the  proportion  of  expenditure  to  gross  income  is \nsimilar  for  both  the  rural  and  urban  areas.  This  may  be  explained  by  the  distribution \n\n29 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nsystem  of  manufacturers  of  many  consumer  goods  that  deliver  the  supplies  directly  to \nthe  retail  outlets  as  part  of  their  promotional  strategies,  thus  effectively  shouldering  the \ntransportation cost. It is more costly to manufacture in the urban areas than in rural areas, \nwhere most raw materials originate. Transportation cost is lower in rural areas, while it is \nbloated  in  urban  areas.  Cost  of  production  in  the  transportation  sector  is  expectedly \nhigher in rural areas than in urban ones. \n\nTotal income among rural households averages PhP 102,877, which is only 47% the \nincome of their urban counterparts. Although the non-agricultural income source among \nrural households has been expanding, the income is still low at PhP 75,836, only 35% of \nthe  average  non-farm  income  in  urban  areas.  Although  the  number  of  non-agricultural \nincome sources is growing, quality still needs further improvement to facilitate bridging of \nthe  income  gap  among  rural  and  urban  households.  The  savings  rate  among  rural \nhouseholds is 15% while it is 17% among urban households. \n\nUsing  nationally  determined  income  deciles,  rural-urban  inequality  is  further \nemphasized in Table 5.1. In urban areas, the median income is way up in the 7th decile, \nindicating that over half of the urban households are among the well-off 30% nationwide. \nThe  reverse  is  true  in  the  rural  areas,  where  about  half  of  the  households  are  in  the \nbottom 30% nationwide. \n\nTable 5.1 Income Decile Distribution of Rural-Urban Households (2003) \n\n \n\nIncome Deciles \n(1-Lowest, 10-Highest)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nRural Households \n(%)\n16.03\n15.30\n14.32\n12.65\n10.60\n8.54\n7.11\n6.05\n5.28\n4.12\n\nUrban Households \n(%) \n1.66 \n2.70 \n4.38 \n6.67 \n8.97 \n11.52 \n13.36 \n15.07 \n16.54 \n19.13 \n\nSource of basic data: 2003 Family Income and Expenditures Survey, \n\nNational Statistics Office (Philippines) \n\n5.1.2  Rural Household Perception on Development \n\nThe  rural  households  surveyed \n\nto  provide  perceptions  on  certain \nin  2005 \ndevelopment  issues  have  heads  that  are  mostly  married  (83%),  a  good  proportion  of \nheads  that  are  college  level/graduate  (22%),  and  17%  are  female-headed.  The \nhouseholds  are  also  relatively  young,  with  an  average  of  43%  of  members  below  21 \nyears old. As indicated in the previous section, nuclear family types are very common in \nrural areas with 73% of the households fitting into this category. The rural electrification \nproject  seems  to  get  an  indication  of  success  with  82%  reported  to  have  electricity \nconnection; rural households pay an average of PhP 367 for the monthly bill. \n\nSince the samples were purposively selected to reveal the perception of those who \nhave  actually  benefited  from  infrastructure  and  other  development  assistance,  65% \nindicated that income is generated from farming activities, while 74% indicated that they \ngenerate  income  from  non-farm  activities,  in  agreement  with  our  earlier  analysis  of \nexpanding  non-farm  activities  among  rural  households.  The  main  source  of  income \n\n30 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nthough  is  still  agriculture,  with  53%  indicating  that  income  is  derived  mainly  from \nagriculture, fishery and forestry. The incidence of small-scale entrepreneurs was at 19% \nin 2005.  \n\nCrop  diversification  and  multiple  cropping  have  long  been  advocated  by  the \nDepartment  of  Agriculture.  The  response  is  slow,  but  there  is  already  evidence  that \nfarmers are starting to diversify from the traditional rice (31% reported to plant the crop) \nand corn (15% are planting) agriculture. Livestock (6%), bananas (6%), and other high-\nvalue and cash crops are already being planted by the farmers. Even with the availability \nof  irrigation,  rice  and  corn  production  intensities  have  not  increased  considerably \nbecause most of the farmers still plant the crop once a year. \n\nThe  effect  of  the  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program  (CARP)  has  been  a \ndisincentive to cultivators to maintain a large land area, also an important determinant of \nagricultural  development.  The  average  farm  area  is  only  0.86  hectare,  with  more  than \nhalf of the farmers cultivating less than half a hectare of land. They further reported that \nsome  farm  areas  are  upland  (0.32  hectare)  and  non-irrigated  lowland  (0.29  hectare). \nExpectedly,  tenure  has  improved  with  34%  reporting  that  they  own  the  land  they \ncultivate.  There  is  still  a  need  to  further  enhance  tenure  because  15%  still  reported  as \ntenants. \n\nAlthough only 15% of those who have non-farm livelihoods are engaged in full-time \n\nemployment, professions are gradually increasing in variety.  \n\nThere  is  still  a  need  to  push  further  advocacy  campaigns  on  the  understanding  of \ncredit.  A  large  percentage  (71%)  of  the  households  still  believes  that  credit  should  be \nprovided by the government. A consolation though is that 75% already believe that credit \nprovided by the government should be repaid. Cooperatives are the most popular source \nof  credit;  in  fact,  cooperatives  and  credit  are  interchangeable  terms  for  some \nstakeholders.  A  good  number  (26%)  are  aware  that  credit  is  available  from  the \ncooperatives, but only 9% actually accessed it. The low access rate can be attributed to \nthe fact that the rural society considers a loan as a negative value. Interest rates are also \n\u201cdisincentives,\u201d  especially  if  collected  in  the  form  of  a  discount.  Among  those  who \nactually  accessed  loans,  the  most  popular  purpose  was  for  home  financing  (11%), \nfollowed  by  farm  improvement  (8%),  commodity  financing  (6%),  production  loan  (6%), \nand livelihood (4%).  \n\nAccess  to  basic  social  services  is  a  good  yardstick  of  welfare  benefits.  For  their \nhealth,  the  households  rely  on  government  hospitals  as  well  as  private  ones.  The \nsituation is not ideal, however, because some households reported that they still consult \nthose  who  practice  traditional  medicine  and  the  counter  staff  of  pharmacy  stores. \nPrevalence  of  water-borne  diseases  and  chronic  ailments  are  low,  but  infection-related \nsymptoms like cough and fever are still high, possibly an indication of the immunization \ncoverage in rural areas.   \n\nPrincipal  component  analysis  was  used  (NEDA-WB-ASEM,  2005)  in  indexing  the \nliving  condition  and  rural  development  scale.  To  facilitate  the  assessment,  the  index \nbased  on  component  scores  was  re-scaled  so  that  values  range  between  0  and  100, \nwhere  0  indicates  absence  and  100  indicates  complete  agreement  that  there  is  rural \ndevelopment (or living condition is ideal). While living condition yields an average score \nof  62.30,  rural  development  is  lower  with  55.15.  The  average  of  total  income  per \nhousehold is PhP 110,482. The average income from agricultural sources is PhP 30,518 \nand that from non-agricultural sources is PhP 78,570.  \n\n31 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAmong  the  18  scale  items  pertaining  to  living  conditions,  \u201cWater  is  safe  for \ndrinking\u201d got the most agreements from the respondents (84%). Other items in the top \nfive most agreed to by respondents are: \u201cToilet  is  hygienic\u201d (79%), \u201cHousing  unit  is \ncomfortable for the family\u201d (79%), \u201cWater resource is accessible\u201d (76%), and \u201cIt is \nnow easy to take public transportation\u201d (67%).  \n\nThree  items  pertain  to  the  water  and  sanitation  aspect  of  rural  development.  The \n1990\u2019s  witnessed  massive  support  from  multilateral  agencies  on  major  water  and \nsanitation  projects  not  just  in  the  Philippines  but  in  other  developing  countries  as  well, \nespecially in countries in Africa. In the early part of the decade, feasibility studies were \nconducted  and \nthe  physical \ninfrastructure.  It  was  also  during  this  period  that  sustainability  plans  were  considered  a \nvital element in the project design, and the notion of user\u2019s fees was advocated and was \ngaining  gradual  acceptance  among  stakeholders.  Many  of  such  water  projects  are  still \nworking  to  this  day  with  \u201cregular\u201d  rehabilitation  by  the  user\u2019s  group  (using  user\u2019s  fees \ncollected), the local government, or through development assistance.  \n\nthe  construction/rehabilitation  of \n\nfollowed  by \n\nlater \n\nPublic  transportation,  which  is  synonymous  with  road  projects,  is  one  of  the  most \nappreciated interventions by the stakeholders. This is a benefit from the construction and \nrehabilitation  of  rural  roads,  but  only  67%  agree  to  the  scale  item  that  transportation  is \neasy.  This  low  proportion  can  be  explained  by  the  difficulty  in  the  institutionalization  of \nsustainability  measures.  Unlike  the  water  system  where  the  beneficiaries  have  direct \ncontact  almost  every  day,  the  importance  of  roads  is  sometimes  taken  lightly.  A  user\u2019s \nfee  is  very  difficult  to  advocate,  taxation  is  a  remote  possibility  since  most  of  the  rural \nhouseholds  are  earning  income  below  the  minimum  taxable  income,  and  the  local \ngovernment is difficult to rely on because the term for local public servants is only three \nyears and the complicated political system is a disincentive for them to allocate funds for \nthe  maintenance  of  rural  roads.  The  main  roads  (called  national  roads)  are  maintained \nby the national government, and in many instances, the local government would like to \npass on the responsibility maintaining rural roads to them.   \n\nAlthough  income  remains  low  in  rural  areas,  perceptions  on  living  conditions  are \nrelatively  better,  a  clear  indicator  that  the  intervention  efforts  are  gaining  grounds \ntowards attaining the target outcomes. \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  five  scale  items  receiving  the  least  agreement  are:  \u201cThere \nare  enough  jobs  available  now\u201d  (23%),  \u201cThere  is  enough  training  on  possible \nlivelihoods\u201d (32%), \u201cThere  is  enough  training  on  new  farming  techniques\u201d (35%), \n\u201cOur living conditions now are much better than 5 years ago\u201d (39%), and \u201cIncome \nis  more  regular\u201d  (41%).  These  perceptions  can  be  viewed  to  be  indicators  of  the \ndemand  for  more  sustainable  interventions  like  new  job  generation  and  training  on \nlivelihoods  and  new  farming  techniques.  Although  there  are  intervention  packages  that \nimplicitly  target  these  issues,  many  are  still  inadequate  in  support  for  livelihood \nexpansion. Another view of these perceptions is that the stakeholders are already open \nto  the  intervention  paradigm  of  facilitation  of  access  rather  than  direct  provision  of \nproduction inputs. \n\nThe  rural  development  scale  includes  13  items.  Agreement  to  these  items  is \ngenerally  lower  than  agreement  to  the  items  in  living  conditions.  The  living  condition \nscale  may  be  viewed  as  a  direct,  more  immediate  manifestation  of  development,  while \nthe rural development scale is a medium- to possibly long-term outcome. Among the top \nthree  items  that  most  respondents  agreed  to,  \u201cGovernment\u2019s  effort  on  agricultural \nresearch  is  important\u201d  got  the  highest  with  60%.  It  is  remarkable  for  the  rural \nhouseholds  to  appreciate  the  value  of  research.  This  may  have  been  gradually \n\n32 \n\n\f \n\n \n\ninculcated  to  them  on  various  trainings  and  extension  in  which  they  have  participated. \nAgricultural research is an important ingredient of sustainable agriculture. Appreciation of \nthe beneficiaries on this effort is a good start. \u201cEcological integrity can be maintained \nwhile there is development\u201d was agreed with by 49% of the respondents, and this was \nfollowed  by  \u201cThe  rural  sector  participates  in  the  discussion  on  development \nissues\u201d  with  47%.  The  effect  of  advocacy  campaigns  may  be  seen  to  be  sinking  in, \nsince  they  are  now  aware  of  development  and  environmental  issues  and  their  role  in \nvarious  processes  involved.  The  rural  stakeholders  are  now  open  to  the  participatory \ntype of intervention. \n\nthe \n\nThe \n\nitems \n\nthat  generated \n\nleast  agreements  are:  \u201cThere  are  enough \nemployment opportunities\u201d (21%), along with the parallel item (for consistency check) \n\u201cThere is enough employment/livelihood in the area\u201d (25%). These perceptions are \nconsistent  with  what  households  said  about  the  living  conditions  above.  \u201cThe  poverty \nreduction  strategy  of  the  government  is  effective\u201d for 26% of the respondents. This \nmeans that about three-fourths of the respondents do not agree that these items are true \nor  they  are  indifferent  to  such.  Employment  and  livelihood  expansion/diversification, \nwhich  are  usually  organic  to  poverty  reduction  strategies,  should  be  revisited  and \nupdated.  There  might  be  a  discrepancy  between  what  is  planned  or  programmed  and \nwhat  the  beneficiaries  are  actually  capable  of  adopting  among  the  livelihood  and  other \nincome-expanding activities. \n\n5.1.3  Household Perception on Development Interventions \n\nHouseholds  were  surveyed  to  provide  perceptions  on  availability,  actual  access, \nwhether  it  is  needed,  whether  they  were  satisfied  when  they  accessed  it,  and  whether \nthey  think  access  is  effective,  of  the  homogeneous,  interrelated  outputs  (rural \ninfrastructure, support services, and capacity building) by the rural sector agencies in the \nPhilippines. The scale used is given in Appendix 2.  \n\nWe  shall  focus  on  the  top/lowest  five  available,  accessed,  needed,  satisfied,  and \neffective  interventions  (details  are  contained  in  Appendix  3).  An  overwhelming  85%  of \nthe respondents are aware of the construction of health centers in their communities. Of \nthose who are aware that these are available, 78% actually used them, while 83% said \nthey  are  indeed  needed.  Among  those  who  accessed  the  centers,  73%  said  they  are \nsatisfied,  while  72%  agreed  that  they  are  effective  (in  the  provision  of  basic  health \nservices).  The  distant  next  most  available  infrastructure/support  services/capacity-\nbuilding  interventions  are:  rural  roads,  distribution  of  high  quality  hybrid  seeds/planting \nmaterials,  fertilizer  support,  and  irrigation.  While  interventions  were  known  to  be \navailable,  not  all  households  accessed  them.  A  significant  number  also  believe  that \nthese are not needed. A good preparatory team who would conduct participatory needs \nassessment  and  an  advocacy  campaign  could  help  bridge  the  information  gap  here. \nEffectiveness  and  satisfaction  from  access  of  such  interventions  received  even  lower \nassessment scores. This can be attributed to possible loose ends in the implementation \nstrategies.  Not  providing  intervention  is  sometimes  better  than  intervention  with  a  half-\nbaked, not carefully planned implementation strategy.  \n\nBeneficiaries  generally  set  high  regards  to  something  provided  for  free.  However, \namong  the  top  five  most  available  interventions,  only  two  are  direct  provisions  (seeds \nand  fertilizer  support);  the  other  three  are  infrastructure  interventions  that  will  facilitate \naccess to factors of production and can enhance rural living conditions. This can further \nbe  interpreted  to  mean  that  the  rural  households  may  be  ready  for  a  shift  in  rural \ndevelopment  intervention  from  direct  provision  of  factors  of  production  to  facilitation  of \naccess to such.  \n\n33 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nThe interventions least perceived to be available are support services and capacity-\nbuilding  activities,  including  training  and  information  on  community-based  management \nof  resources,  training  on  microenterprise  development,  support  services  on  market \ninformation,  market  linkages,  and  commodity  volume  accumulation.  The  proportion  of \nrespondents  who  are  aware  of  such  services  ranges  from  9  to  11%.  Given  that  these \ninterventions are not known to be available, awareness of their usefulness is a problem. \nThe  rural  households  cannot  yet  understand/appreciate  the  importance  of  these \ninterventions,  but  once  they  are  clearly  introduced,  people  will  learn  to  value  them  and \nthe interventions may possibly stimulate development. \n\nMarketing support for the farmers has been planned many times in the past, but the \nusual conflict always crops up from the virtual isolation of many producing areas. In the \n1990\u2019s, accessibility among rural areas was very poor. Now that the beneficiaries already \nindicated  availability  of  such  accessibility  means,  marketing  support  can  again  be  re-\nexamined, not necessarily starting from scratch. \n\nWith  a  thoroughly  planned  advocacy  campaign,  the  beneficiaries  are  amenable  to \ncontribute  to  the  maintenance  of  rural  infrastructure.  The  importance  of  rural  roads  is \nwell-appreciated by the households. A good proportion of respondents (67%) are willing \nto  contribute  either  cash  or  labor  in  the  maintenance  of  rural  roads.  Sustainability  of \nwater systems depends so much on the routine maintenance that should be done. This \nis recognized by the stakeholders and 58% indicated willingness to contribute/participate \nin  maintenance  of  water  systems.  The  unresolved  institutional  issues  associated  with \nirrigators\u2019  associations  and  the  groups  looking  at  other  post-harvest  facilities  may  have \nprompted  households  to  volunteer  lesser  support  in  the  maintenance  (irrigation  with \n43%, other post-harvest facilities with 47%).  \n\n5.2  RATIONALE FOR THE MODELS \n\nTwo classes of models were developed to characterize the household utility function. \nLogistic regression was fitted for a dichotomized response to the scale item on whether \nor  not  the  household  perceived  rural  development.  Then  the  rural  development  scale \nwas aggregated into an index using principal component analysis. With the index score \nand data on direct questions on farm, non-farm and total income, the models postulated \nin  the  framework  presented  earlier  were  estimated  through  a  spatial  autoregressive \nmodel, using the hybrid backfitting algorithm (Landagan and Barrios, 2007). The bulk of \nindicating  perceptions  on \nvariables \ninfrastructure  and  other  development  interventions)  led  to  the  supervised  backward \nelimination of variables to trim down a few redundant variables.  \n\nthe  equations  (mostly  dummy  variables \n\nin \n\nThe use of an index based on perceptions alongside actual income measurement is \nintended  to  validate  the  assumption  that  perceptions  can  provide  early  lead  on  the \npotential  outcome  (rural  development)  early  on  during  the  implementation  of  an \nintervention.  \n\nSparse  spatial  autoregressive  models  are  also  developed  using  a  nationally \nrepresentative  sample,  the  2003  Family  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey.  The  income \ndata  from  the  survey  can  be  viewed  as  an  indicator  of  the  medium-  to  long-term \ndevelopment outcome. Income and transportation cost reduction are long-term outcomes \nafter \nthe \nconstruction/rehabilitation  of  roads  must  happen  before \nthey  eventually  reduce \ntransportation cost. Because there is no direct indicator on availability of rural roads from \nthe data set, expenditures on certain production inputs, cost of economic activities, and \ntransportation costs are used as proxy indicators.  \n\ntedious  dynamics  among \n\nstakeholders.  A \n\nlong  process \n\nfrom \n\n34 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5.3  RURAL HOUSEHOLD DYNAMICS \n\nWe will present in this section the household model dealing with utility maximization \nand  production  in  the  short-run  and  the  characteristics  of  the  long-term  income \noutcomes.  The  potential  determinants  available  in  the  database  are  used  to  control  for \ninherent heterogeneity, but we focus particularly on those concerning rural infrastructure \nand other development interventions.  \n\n5.3.1  Rural Household Models \n\nLogistic  regression  reveals  (p<0.000)  the  relationship  of  the  dichotomous  response \non  whether  the  household  perceives  rural  development  explained  by  various  factors  of \nproduction,  community  participation  indicators,  diversity  in  income  and  livelihood,  and \navailability and need for various rural infrastructure and other development interventions. \nWith  the  default  cut-off  probability  of  0.5,  65%  of  the  perceptions  can  be  correctly \npredicted from the model, with sensitivity of 41% and specificity of 82%. The households \nthat  think  that  there  is  no  rural  development  are  much  easier  to  understand  than \nhouseholds who believe that there is rural development, justifying our earlier claim about \nhow complex the rural development process is. The complete results are in Appendix 4. \n\nThe  rural  development  scale  was  converted  into  the  rural  development  index  (RDI) \nusing  principal  component  analysis.  The  index  was  then  regressed  on  various \ndeterminants using the hybrid backfitting algorithm. Two spatial distance measures were \nadded: average of the response (RDI) per region and per site. The different sites actually \nrepresent the different types of homogeneous interventions provided by the government. \nResults  presented  in  Appendix  5  yield  a  mean  absolute  percentage  error  of  14%,  with \nonly 10% of the sample data points resulting to an error beyond 30%. \n\nAlongside  perceptions  on  various  aspects  of  rural  development,  income  data  was \nalso collected. With farm income as the response and using a spatial distance measure \nat  the  regional  level  along  with  other  determinants  of  income,  an  additive  model  was \nfitted also via the backfitting algorithm. The results in Appendix 6 yield a very low mean \nabsolute  percentage  error  (MAPE)  of  3%,  indicating  good  fit  of  the  model  to  the  data. \nFurthermore,  only  5%  of  the  observations  yield  MAPE  exceeding  10%.  For  non-farm \nincome, results are summarized in Appendix 7, also indicating good fit with a MAPE of \nonly 6%, and 90% of the sample points yield predicted non-farm income level with error \n<12%. \n\n5.3.2  Utility Maximization \n\nThe  utility  function  of  the  households  as  a  benefit  from  rural  development  is \nmeasured using an 18-point scale. From the scale, there is a direct question on whether \nor not they believe there is rural development.  This item was dichotomized and logistic \nregression with a spatial distance indicator was fitted. Responses to the 18 scale items \nare  also  aggregated  into  an  index  and  sparse  spatial  autoregression  was  fitted.  The \ndeterminants for both the dichotomous response and the index are presented below for \neach group of determinants.  \n\nDemographic Determinants \n\nA household\u2019s intention to migrate can be an indication of one or a combination of the \nfollowing: there are not enough livelihood opportunities in the current location, preference \nfor  a  job  or  a  living  environment  different  from  the  present,  dissatisfaction  with  the \npresent  living  condition,  and  many  other  reasons.  Those  who  do  not  intend  to  migrate \n\n35 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nhave 19% higher odds of perceived rural development than those who intend to migrate. \nThis indicator also positively contributes to the rural development index (p<0.024).  \n\nA family member reported to have cough (that needs consultation) results in lower (-\n24%)  odds  of  perceived  rural  development  for  the  household.  Having  a  cough  is  an \nindicator  of  the  state  of  health  conditions  among  household  members.  A  household \nmember  reported  to  have  been  confined  in  a  government  hospital  may  indicate \ninsufficient means for the household. This leads to a lower rural development index for \nthe household as well (p<0.026).  \n\nA higher proportion of household members 6\u201312 years old attending school leads to \na  higher  rural  development  index  (p<0.007).  This  also  means  that  school  is  now  more \naccessible  or  available  (due  to  roads,  construction  of  a  school  building  in  nearby \ncommunities).  Increasing  access  to  this  basic  social  service  is  an  empowerment \nmechanism, one of the prerequisites for rural development.  \n\nFewer  dependents  below  12  years  old  (0<0.035),  more  working  members  over  21 \nyears old (p<0.003), and having a member employed in agriculture, fishery, and forestry \n(p<0.040)  also  contributes  to  raising  the  rural  development  index  score  for  the \nhousehold. \n\nParticipation \n\nCommunity  participation  is  one  concrete  step  towards  empowerment  of  the \nstakeholders.  Some  participation  indicators  appeared  to  contribute  positively  to  raising \nthe rural development index score or the odds of perceived rural development among the \nrespondents.  Those  who  reported  to  be  members  of  an  irrigators\u2019  association  have  a \n91% higher chance of perceiving rural development than the non-members, members of \na \nthan  non-members,  and  even \nmembership in an ordinary community organization can increase the odds of perceiving \nrural  development  by  25%  over  non-members.  Membership  to  irrigators\u2019  organizations \nand  community  organizations  also  contribute  positively  to  the  rural  development  index \nscore of the household. \n\nfarmers\u2019  organization  have  29%  higher  odds \n\nNot  only  will  it  help  facilitate  the  implementation  of  sustainability  provisions,  but \nwillingness to contribute in the maintenance of roads (p<0.004), irrigation (p<0.047), and \nother post-harvest facilities (p<0.000) also increases the rural development index score \nfor the household. \n\nTenure, Farming Systems, and Ownership/Possessions \n\nFavorable  factors  of  production  and  possession/ownership  enhances  households\u2019 \nperceptions of rural development. A household having an electricity connection has 56% \nhigher odds of perceiving rural development than one having no connection. Those with \nstrong  wall  materials  will  have  38%  higher  odds  of  agreeing  that  there  is  rural \ndevelopment. Ownership of a sanitary toilet  (p<0.000) and having strong roof materials \n(p<0.011) will also increase the rural development index score of the households.  \n\nAs  expected,  increasing  farm  income  results  in  an  increasing  rural  development \nindex (p<0.015), confirming further the validity  of the index as a good  measure of  rural \ndevelopment level as perceived by the households.  \n\nAn  amortizing  owner  of  the  land  being  cultivated  will  have  92%  higher  odds  of \nagreement that there is rural development, while those who inherited their tenancy status \nhave  43%  lower  odds  of  perceiving  rural  development.  As  tenure  improves,  there  is \n\n36 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nevidence  that  the  perceptions  of  the  households  improve,  and  as  a  result,  that  rural \ndevelopment is perceived to be present.  \n\nIncreasing  cultivated  area  (p<0.000)  results  in  improving  perception  on  rural \ndevelopment.  This  generates  necessary  criticism  of  the  agrarian  reform  law  that  limits \nownership of agricultural land. As postulated in the framework discussed in Section 4.5, \nsquared  mean-adjusted  age  (p<0.049)  also  contributes  positively \nthe  rural \ndevelopment index.  \n\nin \n\nAccess to Other Development Interventions \n\nThe  households  were  asked  if  the  homogeneous  outputs  of  government  agencies \nworking  on  the  rural  sector  are  available,  if  they  accessed  these  interventions,  and \nwhether  they  are  needed.  Availability  and  need  for  certain  interventions  yields  positive \ncontributions in their perceptions on rural development, while availability of interventions \nthat are not needed can diminish their perceptions on rural development. \n\nAmong  the  interventions  intended  to  increase  agricultural  production,  availability \neven if it is perceived to be not needed (perhaps respondents have not yet realized the \nintended need) of training on planting technologies can increase odds of perceiving rural \ndevelopment almost three times. Availability and perceived need of training on multiple \ncropping can increase odds of perceived rural development by 12%. Availability, even if \nperceived  as  not  needed,  of  training  on  hybrid  variety  also  increases  the  rural \ndevelopment  index  score  for  the  household  (p<0.010).  Availability  of  training  on  pest \nmanagement, if perceived to be not needed, can reduce by more than half respondents\u2019 \nodds of saying that there is rural development. This is also true for community nurseries \nand  training  on  new  planting  technology.  The  reason  for  the  decline  in  chances  of \nperceiving  rural  development  in  cases  where  non-needed  interventions  are  provided  is \nthat  the  stakeholders  may  have  realized  the  inefficiency  in  the  delivery  of  such \ninterventions. \n\nPost-harvest  and  marketing  supports  are  also  included  in  the  list  of  homogeneous \noutputs of the government in the rural sector. Availability and perceived need for support \nin  volume  accumulation  (needed  to  empower  the  farmers  to  negotiate  for  prices) \nincreases  the  likelihood  of  perceived  rural  development  by  17%.  Support  in  marketing \ninformation  also  contributes  to  the  rural  development  index  scores  of  households \n(p<0.003).  Perceived  need  for  a  warehouse  (but  lack  of  availability)  with  available  (but \nnot  needed)  support  for  market  linkages  leads  to  a  lower  rural  development  index, \nproving the inefficiency of spreading resources intended for development intervention too \nthin. If support for market linkages is provided, volume has to be accumulated and stored \nin  a  warehouse,  and  the  rural  roads  must  be  viable  so  that  transportation  cost  will  not \nshoot up to offset the potential earnings for the farmers. \n\nEmpowerment  of  the  community  and  active  participation  on  development  issues  by \nrural  households  are  best  achieved  through  the  organization  of  a  cooperative.  Once \norganized, sustainability can be ensured through advocacy efforts among the members \nand  cooperative  management  trainings  for  the  officers.  Those  who  perceived  that \ntraining on cooperative management is needed but is not available have 80% lower odds \nof agreement that there is rural development. \n\nThose  who  noted  that  training  on  community-based  management  of  resources  was \navailable  and  needed  would  have  the  tendency  to  score  low  in  the  rural  development \nindex  (p<0.008).  This  can  be  attributed  to  a  possible  problem  in  the  design  of  such \ntraining programs. \n\n37 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAvailability  of  training  on  off-farm  livelihoods,  even  if  they  do  not  yet  think  it  is \nneeded,  can  increase  the  households\u2019  likelihood  of  believing  that  there  is  rural \ndevelopment by 96%. \n\nAccess and Perceptions on Credit \n\nAlthough credit is not new in development interventions, many of its features are still \nnot  correctly  understood  by  the  stakeholders.  There  is  still  a  need  for  an  intensive \nadvocacy  campaign  to  emphasize  the  intended  benefit  from  a  credit  program.  As \nmentioned previously, there is still a strong belief among the rural households that credit \nshould be provided by the government. Those who think that credit is the government\u2019s \nresponsibility have 29% higher odds of perceiving rural development. Even if credit is to \nbe provided by the government, the encouraging finding is that respondents now agree \nto  repay  the  loan.  About  a  decade  earlier,  many  rural  credit  facilities  in  the  Philippines \nfailed because of the very low repayment rate attributed to the misunderstanding that is \nthe  credit  was  a  dole  out  from  the  government  coupled  with  real  incapacity  among  the \nborrowers to pay because of the inherent design defects of the system.  \n\nKnowing  that  there  is  an  available  source  (cooperative)  in  case  of  financial  needs \nincreases the likelihood of the household\u2019s belief that there is rural development by 27%. \nKnowledge  of  availability  of  credit  from  a  government  bank  (p<0.022)  and  other \ngovernment  financial  institutions  (p<0.000)  also  increases  the  rural  development  index \nscore for the household.  \n\nThose who accessed credit from cooperatives have higher rural development index \nscores while those who received credit from other government financial institutions have \nlower scores. The stringent policies in more formal credit facilities may have contributed \nin the decline of household utility even if in the long-run, interest rates from cooperatives \nbecome exceedingly high. The laxity in the availment and payment scheme among the \ncooperatives  has  been  very  attractive  to  the  farmers.  Credit  from  more  formal  financial \ninstitutions like rural banks can improve the borrowing system of cooperatives to attract \nmore farmers to access their services.  \n\nAvailability  and  need  of  loans  for  agricultural  production  and  actual  availment  have \nlower utility for the rural households, resulting in lower rural development index scores. \nAvailment  of  loans  even  for  the  purpose  of  enhancing  agricultural  production  is  still \ncreating  a  stigma  of  incapability  among  the  farmers.  They  believe  that  it  is  a  threat  for \ntheir dignity to have borrowed money. Advocacy strategies should take these beliefs into \nconsideration.  \n\nBundles of Infrastructure/Interventions \n\nSome common groups of infrastructure and other development interventions that are \nusually  bundled  together  are  tested  for  their  simultaneous  effect  on  the  perceptions  of \nstakeholders.  This  will  contribute  to  resolving  the  negative  effect  of  stand-alone \ninterventions and finding the answer to the less efficient strategy of spreading resources \ntoo thin.  \n\nA  bundle  of  training  on  farming  (pest  management,  planting  technology,  farm \nmachineries,  harvesting  methods,  use  of  hybrid  varieties,  multiple  cropping,  and  crop \nselection)  will  not  necessarily  increase  the  utility  of  the  households.  In  fact,  their \nlikelihood  of  agreement  that  there  is  rural  development  is  20%  lower  if  they  perceived \navailability of the training bundle. This is a case when even if the intervention is a bundle, \nif there is no lateral support before and after this bundle in the production chain, it will be \nuseless. Trainings aimed to increase production should also be accompanied by support \n\n38 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nin  the  input  acquisition  and  in  post-production  processes  until  marketing  to  ensure \noptimal benefit. \n\nTraining  on  off-farm  livelihood  and  the  provision  of  credit  intended  for  livelihood \ngeneration  and  microenterprise  development  are  good  tandem  programs  that  can \nincrease  the  likelihood  (38%  more)  that  the  household  will  perceive  rural  development. \nIn-farm livelihood, credit, and rural roads, on the other hand, result in a 49% reduction in \nthe  chance  that  the  household  will  perceive  that  there  is  rural  development.  Possible \nexplanations  could  be  faulty  design,  especially  of  the  in-farm  livelihood,  or  that \ninterventions  were  implemented  piecewise  (perhaps  at  different  time  frames),  so  the \nintegrated effect is not realized. \n\nA training program on microenterprise development with credit facilities bundled with \nrural  roads  is  one  ideal  combination  of  interventions  included  in  the  bundle.  Those \nhouseholds who perceive availability of the bundle have 79% higher odds of agreement \nthat  there  is  rural  development,  in  addition  to  the  increase  in  their  rural  development \nindex  scores.  An  in-farm  livelihood  training  with  a  credit  facility  but  without  a  rural  road \nthat  is  needed  results  in  the  decline  of  the  rural  development  index  scores  of  the \nhouseholds. \n\nUnless  there  is  an  appropriate  vertical  support  for  an  intervention  in  the  production \nchain,  the  effectiveness  measured  in  terms  of  rural  development  cannot  be  expected. \nEfficiency of development interventions can be guaranteed if they are bundled together. \nIntensive intervention in a site is more optimal than spreading resources to many sites. \n\n5.3.3  Household Production (Farm Income) \n\nThe  rural  households  generate  income  from  either  farm  or  non-farm  sources. \nTraditionally, the rural economy has been known to be agrarian. However, having all of \nthe  income  of  rural  households  coming  from  farm  sources  is  not  sustainable  because \nfarmers  are  highly  vulnerable  to  weather  and  other  environmental  conditions.  The  rural \neconomy is easily toppled by a major typhoon, a devastating infestation, a drought, and \nmany other occurrences. Also, as trading intensifies, new economic sectors are created, \nopening  alternative  opportunities  for  the  households.  Diversification  of  economic \nactivities  provides  a  remedy  to  the  vulnerable  condition  among  the  rural  households. \nThus,  rural  development  is  also  gauged  in  terms  of  how  much  non-farm  income  is \ngenerated.  However,  a  continuous  supply  of  food  should  also  be  ensured,  so  the \nbehavior of both farm and non-farm incomes are considered important indicators of rural \ndevelopment.  We  will  present  in  this  section  some  determinants  contributing  to  farm \nincome generation and in the next section we will do the same for non-farm income. \n\nDemographic Determinants \n\nSince  farming  has  been  a  life-long  activity  among  farmers\u2014usually  one  passed  on \nover generations\u2014none of the usual demographic attributes contributed to farm income \ngeneration.  Having  attended  high  school  (p<0.000)  or  college  (p<0.001)  means  lower \nfarm  income  for  the  household.  Usually,  the  educated  members  of  a  rural  household \nwould have alternative livelihoods; preference is usually on non-farm-based activities.  \n\nParticipation \n\nMembers  of  key  organizations  like  generic  farmers\u2019  organizations  (p<0.000), \ncooperatives  (p<0.016),  irrigators\u2019  associations  (p<0.000),  and  credit  organizations \n(p<0.000) have higher farm income compared to the non-members. Membership in the \norganization is a usual pre-requisite to be prioritized or in some cases to be able to avail \nof  the  services  provided  by  the  organization.  Physical  infrastructure  like  irrigation  and \n\n39 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nroads, and economic infrastructure like credit and input merchandising (usually done by \nfarmers\u2019 organizations) needs efficient management for maintenance and sustainability, \nwhich  are  the  usual  tasks  of  organizations.  Membership  in  an  organization  is  not  only \nintended to access the respective services, but will also contribute to the empowerment \nof the rural communities.   \n\nIn  addition  to  membership  in  the  different  organizations,  those  who  indicated \nwillingness  to  contribute  to  the  maintenance  of  irrigation  (p<0.000)  and  post-harvest \nfacilities  (p<0.000)  also  benefit  in  terms  of  higher  farm  income.  The  organizations \nsometimes  curtail  the  privilege  of  members  to  avail  services  if  they  have  defaulted  on \ntheir contribution for the maintenance (repayment for credit or procurement of input).  \n\nTenure and Farming Systems \n\nPhilippine  agriculture  has  long  been  dominated  by  rice  and  corn.  The  bulk  of  the \nprograms in agriculture focused on the production and distribution of these crops. They \nare  also  considered  political  commodities:  these  programs  usually  receive  the  largest \nchunk of the total budget for agriculture. Thus, planting rice (p<0.000) or corn (p<0.000) \neasily contribute to raising farm income of the rural households. The cumulative benefits \nfrom  the  programs  geared  towards  rice  and  corn  production  are  easily  translated  into \nfarm  income.  Furthermore,  although  corn  is  generally  planted  only  once  a  year,  those \nwho  attempted  to  plant  more  than  once  a  year  (p<0.001)  also  generated  higher  farm \nincome. This means that once-a-year production for corn is not yet optimal.  \n\nThose  who  plant  coconut  (p<0.000)  or  industrial  crops  like  rubber  (p<0.000)  and \nthose who raise livestock (p<0.000) also have higher farm income. Although coconut is \nnot  a  high  value  crop,  the  opportunities  for  multiple  cropping  interspersed  among  the \ntrees can help increase farm income. Industrial crops will definitely have price premiums, \nwhile properly conducted livestock-raising can be very productive and raise farm income \nas well.   \n\nA  larger  area  of  cultivated  land\u2014regardless  of  type  and  topography\u2014yields  higher \nfarm  income.  The  area  of  irrigated  lowland  (p<0.000),  non-irrigated  lowland  (p<0.027), \nand upland (p<0.001) all contribute positively to the farm income of the household. This \nmeans that any increases in area cultivated regardless of type can lead to an increase in \nfarm  income.  Increasing  area  improves  not  only  households\u2019  perception  on  rural \ndevelopment  but  their  actual  farm  income  as  well.  Income  is  not  optimal  among  those \nwith  small  pieces  of  land  because  technology  adoption  is  not  efficient  in  their \ncircumstances. As an example, a mechanical thresher will not be practical if there is only \none-fourth hectare of land cultivated, and rentals during harvest season usually shoot up, \neating up the intended earnings for the farmers. \n\nAs  expected,  those  who  own  the  land  they  cultivate  have  higher  farm  income \n(p<0.000), justifying the need for tenure improvement as an essential component of the \nagrarian reform program. \n\nAccess to Infrastructure \nthe  stand-alone \n\nAmong \n\ninfrastructure \n\nis  expectedly \ncontributing  significantly  to  farm  income.  Those  who  reported  that  they  need  irrigation \nand that it is available have higher farm income (p<0.009), while those who need it but to \nwhom  it  is  not  available  have  lower  income  (p<0.016).  Irrigation  is  one  physical \ninfrastructure  element  that  has  a  direct  effect  on  farm  income.  Other  infrastructure \nelements  like  roads  would  have  an  indirect  effect  taking  place  after  the  factors  of \nproduction interact.  \n\ninterventions, \n\nirrigation \n\n40 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAccess to Other Development Interventions \n\nVarious  trainings  on  production  technology  affect  production,  while  post-harvest \nsupports preserve the income margins for the producers (the farmers). While the farmers \nare  not  necessarily  aware  of  the  benefits  from  these  trainings,  resulting  in  a  lower \nperceived  utility  for  them,  the  actual  farm  income  proves  the  effectiveness  of  these \ninterventions. \n\nAvailability  and  perceived  need  for  distribution  of  high  quality  seeds  and  planting \nmaterials  contributes  to  raising  farm  income  (p<0.009).  Although  the  strategy  is  not \nsustainable  because  this  distribution  will  encourage  further  dependence  on  the  part  of \nfarmers,  the  short-term  effect  on  farm  income  is  quite  clear.  If  this  program  can  be \ntranslated  into  some  similar  mechanism,  say  channeling  of  resources  to  research, \nestablishing  seed  banks/community  nurseries,  and  selling  the  seeds/planting  materials, \nthe  strategy  will  become  more  sustainable  while  maintaining  a  similar  benefit.  This \nstrategy  agrees  with  the  positive  effect  on  income  of  need  and  availability  for  a \ncommunity nursery (p<0.020). Even if there is a need for a demonstration farm and it is \navailable,  it  contributes  negatively  to  farm  income  (p<0.002),  probably  because  of  the \ninadequate  support  that  will  link  it  to  the  production  chain.  An  isolated,  stand  alone \ndemonstration farm will be useless.  \n\nThe  need  and  availability  for  training  on  harvesting  methods  and  use  of  equipment \nalso yield higher farm income (p<0.000). The need for training on use of hybrid  variety \nbut non-availability of such can result in lower farm income (p<0.002). These are types of \ncomplementing activities needed to augment the strategies discussed above in order to \nstimulate independence among the farmers, resulting in sustainable production support. \nOn the other hand, perceived need, even if the service is available, for training on pest \nmanagement  can  have  a  negative  effect  on  farm  income.  The  design  of  the  present \ncurriculum  may  not  be  appropriate  or  again,  there  may  be  inadequate  supports  to \noptimize the benefit from the training.  \n\nMilling  on-farm  is  expected  to  add  value  to  the  produce  and  reduce  transportation \ncost.  Perceived  need  and  availability  of  millers  contributed  to  farm  income  increase \n(p<0.000). As for the need and availability of support in terms of marketing information, a \nnegative  effect  (p<0.029)  is  observed,  a  possible  consequence  of  the  isolation  of  the \nproduction  area.  Warehouse  and  hauling  services  will  be  needed  between  milling  and \nmarketing information to produce the optimal benefit among the farmers. \n\nThere  is  a perceived  need  and  availability  for  training  on cooperative  management, \nresulting  in  increase  in  farm  income  (p<0.001)  because  this  will  facilitate  the  efficient \ndelivery  of  services  by  the  cooperative.  Training  of  cooperative  members  that  is  not \nneeded pulls down farm income (p<0.048) because of the time wasted that should have \nbeen spent on productive means in the farm. \n\nEnvironmental  protection  is  beneficial  not  only  in  terms  of  sustainability  but  also  in \nfarm income enhancement. Those who perceived availability of and need for training or \ninformation  on  the  care  and  management  of  the  environment  have  higher  farm  income \n(p<0.039). \n\nAccess of Credit \n\nThe  role  of  credit  in  farm  income  generation  is  clearly  illustrated  by  the  models. \nAccess  to  loans  intended  for  farm  improvement  (p<0.026),  production  loans  (p<0.021), \nor  loans  for  the  procurement  of  post-harvest  facilities  (p<0.033)  contributed  to  farm \nincome  increase.  Credit  availed  from  other  government  financial  institutions  resulted  in \n\n41 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nhigher  farm  income,  while  that  coming  from  cooperatives  yielded  lower  income  for  the \nfarmers. The usually higher interest rates of cooperatives can partly explain this.  \n\n5.3.4  Household Production (Non-farm Income) \n\nAs argued in the previous section, expansion of non-farm income is an indication that \nthe  vulnerability  of  the rural  household  is  gradually  being relieved.  The  determinants  of \nnon-farm income will provide the necessary directions of strategies that will help alleviate \nincome vulnerability of rural households in general.  \n\nThere is evidence of complementation among the determinants of farm and non-farm \nincome. This is an indication that while diversity of income sources is pursued, this does \nnot necessarily uproot the farmers from cultivating the land. Hence, non-farm income is \nnot  intended  to  replace  farm  income,  but  rather  to  augment  it  with  the  intention  of \nmitigating the vulnerability of the rural economy in general.  \n\nDemographic Determinants \n\nTo  increase  the  likelihood  of  generating  non-farm  income,  it  is  important  that  the \nhousehold  head  is  a  college  graduate/level  (p<0.000);  it  is  also  important  that  the \nhousehold includes extended family (p<0.001), has a large size (p<0.000), has a higher \npercentage of household members 17\u201321 years old working (p<0.004), and has a higher \npercentage  of  household  members  over  21  years  old  working  (p<0.039).  While  higher \neducational level is a negative determinant to farm income, the reverse is true for non-\nfarm  income.  Non-farm  employment,  entrepreneurship,  and  other  livelihood  activities \nfavor those with higher education. The four other indicators indicate that the pooled non-\nfarm  income  of  the  household  depends  on  how  many  household  members  are \ncontributing. \n\nIf  the  main  source  of  income  is  farming,  fishery  or  forestry,  non-farm  income  is \nexpectedly lower (p<0.000). However, even if the main source of income is identified to \nbe  entrepreneurship,  non-farm  income  is  still  lower  (p<0.005),  an  indication  of  the \ninadequacy  of  skills  among  the  rural  household  in  carrying  out  this  economic  activity. \nAside from the usual microenterprise development as an important livelihood expansion \nactivity  in  rural  areas,  they  need  to  be  capacitated  more  on  the  rudiments  of \nentrepreneurship.  \n\nWith  a  household  member  contributing  in  terms  of  foreign  remittances,  non-farm \nincome  increases  (p<0.018).  However,  the  prevalence  of  households  with  foreign \nremittances is very small. Non-farm income is also increased when there is a household \nmember  whose  occupation  is  \u201cprofessional\u201d  because  this  is  among  the  highest  paid \ntypes of occupation (p<0.000). The more family members engaged in full-time jobs, the \nmore non-farm income is expected to be generated (p<0.000). \n\nAccess and Perceptions on Credit \n\nJust  like  in  farm  income,  a  clear  understanding  of  the  benefits  and  responsibilities \nattached to credit availment is important in raising non-farm income. Those who believe \nthat  credit  provided  by  the  government  should  be  repaid  have  higher  non-farm  income \n(p<0.021).  The  benefit  of  cooperativism  goes  beyond  the  farms:  those  who  are  aware \nthat  there  is  a  credit  facility  available  from  the  cooperatives  can  have  higher  non-farm \nincome (p>0.003). \n\nGood  training  on  livelihood  activities  coupled  with  credit  facilities  intended  for \n\nlivelihood or microenterprise development also increases non-farm income (p<0.021). \n\n42 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5.3.7  Long-Term Outcomes of Rural Roads \n\nIncome  is  the  only  indicator  of  rural  development  from  the  Family  Income  and \nExpenditures  Survey.  The  breakdown  of  farm  income  and  non-farm  income  will  be \nanalyzed  separately.  Income  growth  may  manifest  in  the  mid-  to  long-term,  but  spatial \nautoregression  will  help  account  for  the  possible  lagged  effect  of  the  determinants  of \nincome. Furthermore, we have filtered households from rural areas only for the analysis.  \n\nThere  is  also  no  direct  measurement  of  intensity  of  accessibility  infrastructure \nbecause  nationwide  data  is  not  available  at  the  household  or  even  at  the  community \nlevel.  Some  measures  of  expenditures  on  certain  economic  activities  will  be  used  as \nproximate indicators. Although reduction in transport cost is not as instantaneous as the \nprovision  of  rural  roads,  the  fact  that  we  are  also  using  income  as  indicator  of  rural \ndevelopment justifies the causative models. \n\nNon-Agriculture Income \n\nThe demographic determinants of non-farm income with positive effects include age \nof  the  household  head  (p<0.000),  whether  the  head  is  married  (p<0.000),  and  whether \nthe  head\u2019s  education  is  elementary  (p<0.000),  high  school  (p<0.000),  or  college \n(p<0.000).  There  is  a  premium  for  age  in  non-farm  income  generation  because  this  is \nusually  associated  with  accumulated  experience/skills  and  rank.  Being  married  could \nmean that there is a spouse who can also contribute to the household non-farm income. \nFurthermore, any level of education is an investment in non-farm income: the higher the \nlevel of education, the higher the income returns expected. \n\nA  household  reporting  that  income  is  generated  mostly  from  agriculture  would \nactually  have  non-agriculture  income  lower  by  53%  compared  to  those  generating \nincome  mostly  from  non-agriculture.  Even  among  households  in  rural  areas  alone,  the \nvulnerability  of  the  farmers  is  very  clear.  Male-headed  households  also  generate  lower \nnon-farm  income.  This  coincides  with  an  earlier  analysis  on  the  efficiency  of  female-\nheaded  households  in  income  generation.  Nuclear  families  that  usually  have  smaller \nsizes  and  those  with  more  members  under  15  years  old  also  have  lower  non-farm \nincome  because  there  are  a  few  members  eligible/capable  of  non-farm  employment. \nThis is further supported by having more employed individuals and an employed spouse \ngenerating more non-farm income. \n\nIncome generated by professional workers is the highest, followed by the operators \n(usually  skilled),  and  the  laborers  (usually  unskilled).  Those  in  agriculture,  animal \nhusbandry and forestry still generate the lowest income from outside the farm. Although \nthere is a gradual diversification of occupation, the goal of alleviating the vulnerability of \nrural  communities  has  not  yet  been  attained  because  the  indicator  of  employment  in  a \nprivate  enterprise  is  not  significant,  while  employment  in  a  private  household  is \nsignificant. Not enough income is generated from the private enterprises because there \nare only a few of them operating in rural areas. The rural enterprises have not evolved \nyet as planned from being micro to medium (or even small) scale. \n\nHigher  expenditures  on  petroleum,  telephone,  electricity  and  water  are  all  functions \nof accessibility of an area. Isolation of a community can drive all these expenditures high. \nAll  these  indicators  yield  significant,  negative  coefficients  in  the  regression  of  non-farm \nincome.  Furthermore,  expenditure  on  manufacturing  activities  also  yields  a  negative \nregression  coefficient.  Manufacturing  requires  transportation  of  raw  materials  and \nfinished  products,  so  cost  of  production  is  closely  associated  with  transportation  cost. \nImproved accessibility infrastructure can indeed generate more non-farm income among \nthe rural households.  \n\n43 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAgriculture Income \n\nIn  as  much  as  agricultural  production  requires  male  workers,  male-headed \nhouseholds have the advantage of generating more income from agriculture. Strength of \nworkers will have an advantage in land cultivation, so younger people also have natural \nadvantages in agriculture. Education, however, unlike in non-farm income where it has a \npositive contribution, it is not necessarily needed to cultivate the land. Furthermore, while \nthe younger members of the household (<15 years old) cannot yet get jobs outside the \nfarm and thus have negative contributions to non-farm income, they can be used (and, in \nfact, are used) as agriculture labor, doing light jobs like planting, weeding, and harvesting, \nthus contributing positively to agricultural income generation.  \n\nHigher  expenditures  on  electricity,  water  and  land  transportation  are  all  proximate \nindicators  of  availability  of  access  infrastructure.  Expenditures  on  the  wholesale  and \nretail  trade  are  usually  dominated  by  transportation  cost  because  the  activity  requires \nmovement  of  goods  from  the  producers  to  the  consumers.  Cost  in  the  operation  of  a \ntransport  business  easily  increases  when  the  road  system  is  of  poor  quality.  These \nindicators  also  generate  negative  coefficients  in  the  regression  of  agriculture  income, \nindicating  that  accessibility  infrastructure  affects  both  the  farm  and  non-farm  income \nlevels  of  rural  households.  Absence  of  an  accessibility  network  isolates  a  place  or  a \n \ncommunity, reducing their productive potential from both farm and non-farm sources.  \n\n6 \n\nSUSTAINABILITY ISSUES \n\nMassive  amounts  of  development  assistance  have  flowed  into  developing  countries \nthese past decades. Although there has been a dynamic re-shaping of the beneficiaries, \nincluding  their  perceptions  as  time  progresses,  the  issue  of  sustainability  remains  a \npuzzle. Various prescriptions have been provided on how to facilitate sustainability, but \nmany projects still fail in this aspect. We will assess what the beneficiaries have in mind \nthat  can  be  tapped  to  develop  a  concrete  plan  that  will  serve  as  the  backbone  of  the \nsustainability measures, especially for physical infrastructure.  \n\nThe  stakeholders  are  realizing  that  training  (farming  technologies,  livelihood \nactivities,  and  general  purpose  trainings)  can  empower  them  allow  them  to  gain \nequitable  access  to  productive  resources.  Enhanced  accessibility  achieved  through  the \nconstruction  of  rural  roads  will  complement  various  capacity-building  activities  and \nmicrofinancing  to  facilitate  equitable  access  to  productive  resources  among  the  rural \nhouseholds.  The  theoretical  elements  needed  to  pursue  rural  development  are  now \nacknowledged by the stakeholders. Thus, with proper packaging of various development \ninterventions, the rural communities are nearly ready to cooperate in the implementation \nand maintenance facilitated by the government with the support of private enterprises for \nsustainable rural development. \n\n6.1  SUSTAINABILITY AMONG FARMING HOUSEHOLDS \n\nIn 2005, the average total income per farming household was PhP 116,666. Of this \namount,  PhP  66,562  came  from  farming  while  PhP  49,647  came  from  non-farming \nsources. The per capita poverty threshold in 2003 was PhP 11,589 (annual) among rural \nareas, and for a family of 5, this would require an annual income of PhP 57,945, lower \nthan  the  average  income  among  farming  households.  By  deflating  the  2005  income  to \nthe 2003 level, 59% of the rural farming households have income lower than the poverty \nthreshold, while 62% of the individuals have household income lower than the threshold. \nIn 2003, the national poverty incidence was 24.4% (rural and urban), a figure remarkably \n\n44 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nlower than our estimate for all-rural households. At the regional level, the highest poverty \nincidence is 47.1% and at the provincial level, it is 64.6%.  \n\nWhile  average  income  for  rural  farming  households  is  relatively  higher,  poverty \nincidence  does  not  look  better.  Despite  the  higher  average  total  income,  incidence  of \nhouseholds and individuals with income lower than the poverty threshold further highlight \nthe  inequality  in  rural  areas\u2014especially  among  those  who  depend  on  farming.  This  is \nconsistent  with  Hymer  and  Resnick  (1969),  who  observed  increasing  inequality \nassociated with rural development. While rural development may have been progressing \nas indicated by growing average income, farming households are poorly benefiting from \nsuch. Their vulnerability is magnified by the natural constraints of agricultural production. \nGrowth  of  a  crop  cannot  be  mobilized  (unless  a  progressive  agricultural  research \nprogram  produces  a  result),  and  while  waiting  for  the  maturity  period,  there  is  no  other \nincome  expected  from  that  crop.  In  microenterprises,  however,  productivity  can  be \nintensified  by  increasing  appropriate  factors  of  production.  Farming  households  are \nexposed \nincome  vulnerability  while  non-farming  households  will  exhibit \nrobustness, illustrating how rural development can result in further inequality.   \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe  generally  higher  average  income  among  rural  households  supports  rural \ndevelopment as perceived by the stakeholders, with 43% in agreement that there is rural \ndevelopment and 30% still uncertain about it. Only 27% do not agree that there is rural \ndevelopment.  The  overall  measure  of  rural  development,  RDI,  also  yields  a  fairly  high \naverage of 57.39, where 0 means absence and 100 indicates almost certain presence of \nrural development.  \n\n6.1.1  Credit \n\nAn intensive advocacy program on the concept, meaning, and mechanics of credit is \nstill needed so that credit interventions can pursue the benefits they promise to generate \namong  the  beneficiaries.  For  sustainability  of  credit,  universal  targeting  for  such  an \nadvocacy  campaign  will  be  needed  because  these  perceptions  are  true  even  across \ngroups  of  communities,  some  of  which  have  even  been  sites  of  credit  programs  of \ndifferent agencies.   \n\n6.1.2  Physical Infrastructure and Other Interventions \n\nPhysical  infrastructure  requires  regular  maintenance  for  sustainability;  often,  it \nrequires  substantial  financing.  Ideally,  public  investments  in  general  are  maintained \nthrough  a  user\u2019s  fee  system  collected  through  taxes  (possibly  local).  In  the  rural \nPhilippines,  however,  because  many  households  are  earning  less  than  the  minimum \nincome  tax  threshold,  for  sustainability,  maintenance  contribution  should  be  collected \ndirectly  from  the  beneficiaries.  It  is  important  to  understand  the  willingness  of  the \nbeneficiaries to contribute and to match it with their capacity to pay.  \n\nAmong physical infrastructure elements, roads seem to be the most promising in the \nlikelihood of their being maintained. Eighty-seven percent of the farming households are \nwilling  to  contribute  for  the  maintenance  of  roads,  but  only  9%  are  willing  to  contribute \ncash  averaging  PhP106.16  per  cropping  season.  They  realize  the  value  of  roads \nespecially during the harvest season in addition to availability of cash resources during \nthis period. A good number, however, can contribute labor services (73%), while 6% may \nlead users\u2019 organizations, and 30% can contribute only through careful use of the road. \nIn  other  words,  although  they  recognize  the  importance  of  roads  in  their  productive \nactivities, farmers are not ready to shell out cash for their maintenance, but can supply \nlabor to maintain them. Somebody from the group can be identified and will take the lead \n\n45 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nof  the  organization  to  maintain  the  road.  Maintenance  of  roads  is  perceived  to  be  the \nconcern of the local or national government, a view that explains the lack of enthusiasm \namong the farming households for providing money for maintenance. \n\nThe  majority  of  the  farming  households  (74%)  are  willing  to  contribute  for  the \nmaintenance  of  an  irrigation  system  in  their  community.  Although  about  one-fourth  are \nstill  not  ready  to  contribute,  this  majority  shall  be  a  good  start  in  the  development  of \nelements  needed  in  the  maintenance  and  sustainability  of  irrigation  systems.  Of  those \nwho are willing to contribute, 78% also indicated that contributions would be in cash, 7% \nin labor services, 7% are willing to help in the management or in providing leadership to \nthe users\u2019 organization, and 21% would rather use the facility with care. Those willing to \ncontribute in cash indicated an average contribution of PhP 585.51 per month. \n\nA  good  proportion  (75%)  of  farming  households  are  willing  to  contribute  for  the \nmaintenance of post-harvest facilities. However, only 9% indicated that their contribution \nwould  be  in  cash.  The  need  for  such  infrastructure  arises  only  during  harvest  season, \nexplaining  their  disinterest  to  contribute  cash  and  their  desire  to  do  so  only  as  it  is \nneeded,  i.e.,  at  the  end  of  cropping  season.  Even  so,  a  good  number  (69%)  can \ncontribute  labor,  7%  their  leadership/management  of  the  users\u2019  organization,  and  31% \nwill use it with care instead. \n\nFor  the  water  system  that  provides  a  supply  of  potable  water,  84%  of  the  farming \nhouseholds  indicated  willingness  to  contribute  for  the  maintenance,  but  only  12%  are \nwilling  to  provide  cash  at  an  average  of  PhP88.19  per  month.  The  majority  (71%)  are \nwilling to contribute labor services, 5% can lead the users\u2019 group, while 32% will just use \nit with care instead. \n\nSome 78% of the farmers are willing to buy seeds, breeders, planting materials, and \nother inputs instead of a dole out direct provision to them. This is a good indication that \nshould the Department of Agriculture gradually shift from direct provision to facilitation of \naccess to inputs, sustainability can be expected.  \n\nSense of ownership is an essential input for the sustainability of infrastructure. This \ncan  be  easily  achieved  when  the  stakeholders  believe  that  the  infrastructure  is  indeed \nwhat  is  needed  in  their  community,  and  when  they  have  taken  part  in  the  process  of \nidentifying  it.  An  overwhelming  94%  are  willing  to  participate  in  the  identification  of \ndevelopment  projects  in  their  community.  This  will  be  a  good  start  for  a  more \nparticipatory  development  intervention  that  will  eventually  lead  to  greater  long-term \nsustainability. \n\nMaintenance of physical infrastructure requires a viable users\u2019 group who should take \ncare of the collection of fees and the actual maintenance of the facility. A fully matured \nusers\u2019  group  will  be  responsible  enough  to  collect  the  fees  and  use  them  in  the \nmaintenance  of  the  facility.  Misuse  of  users\u2019  fees  can  be  avoided  when  there  is \nsubstantial transparency practiced by the group officers, and when such transparency is \nadvocated  during  the  organizing  and  development  stages  of  the  group.  During  the \norganizing stage, government extension workers may help facilitate the formation of the \norganization, but should gradually distance themselves from the group and later on can \nonly participate to ensure checks and balances among various stakeholders and officers \nof the organization.  \n\n46 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n6.1.3  Contributions of Government Interventions \n\nAmong the homogeneous outputs delivered by the national government engaged in \nthe  rural  sector,  the  projects  that  the  stakeholder  believes  to  contribute  most  towards \nvarious goals were identified. The question was framed as  an unaided, top-of-the-mind \nresponse  mechanism,  therefore  soliciting  a  perception  that  could  have  been  forming  in \nthe mind of the respondents, and not just a result of quick coaching of possible answers.  \n\nTo  increase  agricultural  production,  direct  provision  of  production  inputs  are  viewed \nas  the  most  important  interventions,  with  fertilizer  (14%),  irrigation  (11%),  and  hybrid \nseeds,  breeders  and  other  production  inputs  (8%)  at  the  top.  Training  and  other \ninformation on farming technologies closely follow, with 6% recognizing their importance; \nother  general  trainings  (5%)  follow  those  on  farming  technologies.  Although  the \nstakeholders  perceive  direct  provisions  to  contribute  most  to  increasing  agricultural \nproduction, they are gradually recognizing the importance of capacity building on issues \nregarding modern farming technologies.  \n\nresponses  provided  by  about  5%  of \n\nWhen  asked  about  the  project  that  contributed  most  to  increasing  income,  many \nidentified  fertilizer  support  (14%),  closely  followed  by  trainings  on  livelihood  activities \n(10%).  Other \nrespondents  are \nseed/breeders/planting  materials  support,  irrigation,  post-harvest  facilities,  and  general-\npurpose  trainings.  Note  that  these  are  mostly  production  inputs  provided  with  minimal \nfinancial counterpart from the beneficiaries. Although the stakeholders think these could \nhelp increase their income (because fewer expenses are involved in production), these \nare not necessarily sustainable because these inputs can lead to perpetual dependence \nof the farmers on government support, creating a new source of vulnerability. \n\nthe \n\nImprovement  of  the  environment  is  attributed  mostly  to  trainings  and  information \ncampaigns  on  the  proper  care  and  management  of  the  environment  (12%).  General \npurpose training also helps (7%), as well as rural roads (6%) and training on livelihood \nprograms  (6%).  General-purpose  trainings  usually  cover  advocacy  on  various  issues \nincluding  environmental  concerns  and  other  empowering  information  for  the  rural \ncommunities  and  their  linkages  to  outside  communities.  Rural  roads  mediate  their \nisolation and will open opportunities that are not threats to the environment, in the same \nway as the training on livelihood programs work.  \n\nIt  is  good  that  rural  households  recognize  the  role  of  trainings  on  livelihood  in \npromoting  sustainable  development  (14%).  General  purpose  trainings,  training  on \nfarming  technologies,  post-harvest  facilities,  and  rural  roads  were  also  identified  to \ncontribute  to  attaining  sustainable  development.  This  again  acknowledged  capacity \nbuilding  that  empowers  households,  along  with  the  necessary  support  services  as  the \nmajor elements of sustainable development. \n\nIn terms of poverty reduction, many farming households chose trainings on livelihood \nactivities  to  make  the  biggest  contribution  (22%).  Far  below  in  second  place  is  the \nprovision of credit (9%). Rural roads, training on farming technologies, general purpose \ntrainings, and construction of health centers were also identified to contribute to poverty \nreduction. Indeed, the households recognized that one strategy for poverty reduction is \nto  remedy  their  vulnerability  from  farming  through  the  provision  of  alternative  income \nsources and the necessary support so that these alternatives will elevate them and allow \nthem to escape further entrapment. Many of those who attempted to explore non-farming \nlivelihoods have been forced to rely on non-formal credit sources that charge exorbitant \nincome-generation  capabilities.  Similar \ninterest \ninterventions were identified by the farming households to contribute most to improving \n\nfurther  aggravating \n\nrates, \n\ntheir \n\n47 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nliving  conditions.  This  further  confirms  the  idea  that  poverty  in  rural  areas  is  not \nnecessarily  viewed  as  a  state  of  inequality  but  rather  as  having  hurdles  in  accessing \namenities in life.  \n\n6.2  SUSTAINABILITY AMONG NON-FARMING HOUSEHOLDS \n\nAlthough  there  is  a  lower  total  income  for  non-farming  households  than  for  farming \nones, there are fewer households with income lower than the poverty threshold. This is \nevidence  of  the  volatility  of  farm  income  sources  and  the  relative  stability  of  non-farm \nsources.  Non-farm  factors  of  production  are  easily  accessed  by  the  stakeholders, \nresulting in lesser inequality in earnings. This further emphasizes the importance of non-\nfarm  income  sources  that  cannot  be  ignored  in  alleviating  the  vulnerability  of  rural \nhouseholds.  \n\nFewer  non-farming  rural  households  than  farming  ones  agree  that  there  is  rural \ndevelopment  (38%).  The  same  is  true  for  the  overall  rural  development  index  (53.24), \nwhich is slightly lower for non-farming households. The difference between farming and \nnon-farming households is consistent even with average income. \n\n6.2.1  Credit \n\nThe perceptions of non-farming households on the mechanics of credit are similar to \nthose  of  farming  households.  About  72%  believe  that  credit  should  be  provided  by  the \ngovernment\u2014a slightly lower proportion than among the farming households. Some 22% \nare  not  sure  who  should  provide  the  credit,  but  6%  do  not  think  that  the  government \nshould be the provider. Repayment of credit provided by the government is perceived to \nbe needed for 76% of the non-farming households. \n\n6.2.2  Physical Infrastructure \n\nRural  roads  were  identified  by  non-farming  households  as  a  major  contributor  in \nattaining the different target outcomes in rural development. Respondents said that they \nshould be maintained; 78% of the non-farming households were willing to contribute, but \nonly  11%  indicated  that  they  would  contribute  in  cash.  The  majority  (66%),  however, \ncommitted to contribute in labor services while 4% volunteered to provide leadership or \nmanagement  of  the  organization  responsible  for  the  maintenance,  and  37%  said  they \nwould rather use the equipment/facility with care.  \n\nFor the water system, 71% of the non-farming households are willing to contribute for \nits  maintenance.  Most  of  the  contributions  they  are  willing  to  provide  would  be  in  labor \nservices (63%). Only 15% are willing to contribute cash, while 38% would rather use the \nfacility  with  care.  Some  4%  can  provide  leadership  or  management  in  the  organization \nthat will do maintenance.  \n\nIn  the  identification  of  development  projects,  fewer  non-farming  households  (90%) \nare  willing  to  participate  compared  to  the  farming  households.  There  is  perhaps  a \nmisconception  that  development  intervention  in  rural  areas  is  synonymous  with \nagriculture.  The  advocacy  effort  on  development  interventions  should  thus  include  a \nsignificant focus on the clarification of the purpose and goals of the project.  \n\n6.2.3  Contributions of Government Interventions \n\nThe top-of-the-mind responses of non-farming households to the question on which \ngovernment interventions contributed most to the different goals differ slightly from those \nof the farming households. \n\n48 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nOn the overarching issue of rural development, they identified trainings on livelihood \nsource  along  with  rural  roads  to  contribute  the  most.  Consistent  with  the  theory  of  the \npotential  role  of  rural  roads,  though  trainings  are  crucial,  enhanced  accessibility  will  be \nneeded to optimize the translation of such trainings into productive activities. They also \nidentified  other  interventions  like  the  provision  of  health  centers  that  enhance  welfare \nthrough  the  provision  of  health  services,  development  of  cooperatives  for  institutional \nempowerment,  and  other  general  purpose  trainings  for  further  capacity  building.  The \ncomplex  correlation  between  rural  development  and  sustainable  development  is \nacknowledged by the non-farming households, and they believe that similar interventions \nthat  contribute \ntowards  sustainable \ndevelopment. \n\ntowards  rural  development  also  contribute \n\nPoverty  reduction,  as  perceived  by  non-farming  households, \n\nis  consistently \ndependent  on  three  elements:  capacity  building,  access,  and  welfare.  Training  on \nlivelihood  activities  topped  the  choice  of  project  contributing  most  to  poverty  reduction \n(25%). Credit followed with 10%, while health center construction came next with 8%. \n\nThe  non-farming  households  believe  that  livelihood  trainings  are  very  important  in \nimproving  the  living  conditions,  as  identified  by  23%  of  the  respondents.  Provision  of \nhealth  centers,  rural  roads,  credit,  and  general  purpose  trainings  are  also  believed  to \ncontribute to the improvement of living conditions. \n\nFor  income  increase,  about  one-fifth  of  the  respondents  believe  that  training  on \nlivelihood activities can contribute the most. Rural roads and credit were also identified to \ncontribute in this aspect. Although they are not engaged in agriculture, respondents think \nthat fertilizer support and training on various farming technologies can also contribute to \nincome growth.  \n\nTo improve the condition of the environment, the non-farming households agree with \nfarming  households  that  appropriate  training  and  information  on  the  care  and \nmanagement  of  the  environment  is  needed.  Appropriate  regulatory  services  that  will \nmanage natural resources and other capacity-building trainings can also contribute. \n\n7 \n\nCONCLUDING NOTES  \n\nFrom  the  complex  complementation  among  the  essential  elements  of  rural \ndevelopment\u2014namely  social \nfinancial \ninfrastructure,  physical \nservices\u2014the  linkages  of  these  elements  were  traced  towards  the  attainment  of  rural \ndevelopment  goals.  Income  and  perceptions  were  used  as  indicators  in  the  empirical \nabstraction of rural development. Income provides an easy link between the sequential \ngoals of rural development and poverty alleviation. Perceptions facilitate tracking of rural \ndevelopment  that  manifests  in  the  long-run,  enabling  policies  on  the  provision  of \ndevelopment intervention to be adjusted in the course of implementation. \n\ninfrastructure,  and \n\nThe  debate  on  rural  development  identified  the  unsustainable  features  of  direct \nprovision  of  production  inputs.  Aside  from  being  expensive,  such  provision  will  also \nencourage  further  dependence  by  the  marginal  farmers,  increase  exposure  to \nvulnerability, and worsen income inequality. Facilitation for the rural stakeholders to gain \naccess to various tools needed in agricultural production and in other income generation \nactivities  will  yield  broader  multiplier  effects  and  have  higher  chances  of  sustainability. \nRural roads are viewed as the core component in a package that will facilitate the rural \nstakeholders\u2019  access  to  inputs  in  income  generation.  Rural  roads  will  pave  the  way  for \nother  physical  infrastructure  to  be  delivered  to  previously  isolated  communities.  These \n\n49 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nroads will facilitate the delivery of capacity-building activities and community organizing \nthat leads towards empowerment of the community. A fully empowered community will \nthen be able to stride on a sustainable path towards development. \n\nParticipatory Identification of Development Intervention \n\nThe  survey  illustrated  some  discrepancies  between  what  is  needed  and  what  is \navailable  among  the  interventions  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  stakeholders.  Such \nmismatch results in inefficiency in the utilization of the scarce resources available to the \nrural  communities.  A  participatory  approach  is  crucial  in  project  identification  so  that \nwaste  of  resources  will  be  minimized  and  resources  may  be  reallocated  to  other \nproductive uses. It is important to conduct a perception survey to both assess the impact \nof those interventions already provided and to verify whether they are in accordance with \nthe community needs. \n\nRural Infrastructure \n\nRural  roads  generate  the  largest  impact  in  rural  development  index  and  income \ngrowth.  Furthermore,  the  rural  households\u2019  production  (income-generation)  potential  is \nalso  optimized  with  the  availability  of  an  accessibility  network  that  alleviates  their \nisolation. \n\nProviding  irrigation  systems  in  a  properly  identified  community  necessarily  fuels \ngrowth  in  farm  income  and  optimizes  their  technical  efficiency  in  perceiving  rural \ndevelopment. \n\nIncome Diversification and Agricultural Growth \n\nWhile  income  source  diversification  is  expected  to  propel  total  income  growth, \nincome  from  agriculture  could  suffer  as  a  result  of  labor  shortage  in  a  labor-intensive \nproduction  system.  Gollin,  et.  al.  (2002)  argued  that  low  agricultural  productivity  can \nsubstantially  delay  industrialization.  Thus,  reversion  of  the  potential  negative  effect  of \nimprovement  in  accessibility  to  agricultural  production  requires  that  more  efficient \nfarming  systems  be  introduced  and  adopted  by  farmers.  This  will  sustain  agricultural \ngrowth  while  relieving  some  labor  that  can  take  on  non-farm  income-generating \nactivities, resulting in sustainable income-generation for the family.  \n\nCredit \n\nCredit has a high multiplier effect on non-farm income. This illustrates the efficiency \nand  effectiveness  of  the  use  of  credit  for  non-farm  livelihoods  or  in  microenterprise \ndevelopment.  The  marginal  farmers,  however,  are  in  need  of  capital  to  procure \nproduction  inputs,  but  their  repayment  rate  suffers  when  crops  are  destroyed  due  to \nweather or infestation. It will be more viable for sustainability of the microfinancing funds \nto  set  aside  from  the  loan  proceeds  premium  for  crop  insurance.  On  the  other  hand, \ncredit for livelihood should be provided along with appropriate training on microenterprise \ndevelopment to ensure the efficient use of loan proceeds and later, to guarantee high if \nnot 100% repayment rate.  \n\nCredit  intended  for  specific  farm  activities  exhibits  a  significant  contribution  to  farm \nincome.  Among \nthe \nacquisition/procurement  of  post-harvest  facilities  yields  greater  contribution  to  farm \nincome growth. There is a large proportion of post-harvest losses; if appropriate facilities \n\nthe  credit  accessed  by \n\nintended \n\nfarmers, \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n50 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nare procured by the farmers (possibly through a cooperative or an organization for cost-\neffectiveness), the losses can be converted into farm income.  \n\nBundles of Interventions \n\nProvision  of  rural  roads  should  be  the  core  of  rural  infrastructure.  It  should  be \nbundled  properly  with  support  services  and  capacity-building  activities  like  training  to \nenhance demand for other infrastructure and services, thus resulting in a highly dynamic \nmovement  of  various  elements  essential  in  rural  development.  Bundles  of  intervention \nfurther improve production efficiency of the rural stakeholders because such bundling will \nfacilitate activities at the different stages of production at the farm or outside the farm. \n\nIncome Inequality Aversion and Sustainability \n\nAmong the rural households, those in farming still experience inequality in the access \nto  productive  resources  and  their  vulnerability  is  magnified  further  by  the  natural \nlimitations  of  agricultural  production.  Growth  of  a  crop  cannot  be  fast-tracked  (unless \nthere  is  progressive  agricultural  on-going  research),  and  while  waiting  for  the  maturity \nperiod,  there  is  no  other  income  expected  from  that  crop.  In  microenterprises, \nproductivity can be sped up simply by increasing appropriate factors of production, e.g., \nlabor.  This  explains  the  inequality  between  farming  and  non-farming  households  even \nwhen  there  is  evidence  of  rural  development.  Rural  development  interventions  should \nfocus  more  on  the  vulnerable  segment,  the  farmers,  and  how  they  can  be  gradually \ndetached  from  complete  dependence  on  agriculture,  without  of  course  abandoning  it \ncompletely because food security could also be exposed to risk. \n\nPublic  investments  complemented  with  amounts  from  user\u2019s  fees  will  result  in  a \ncontinuous provision of new infrastructure and maintenance of the existing infrastructure, \nleading  towards  rural  development.  A  socialized  user\u2019s  fee  can  be  considered  for  two \nreasons:  maintenance  (sustainability)  and  support  for  the  low-income  households.  This \nuser\u2019s fee will gain fair access to infrastructure without being burdened with user\u2019s fees, \nwhich  are  sometimes  a  disincentive  given  the  marginal  income  they  generate.  It  is \nimportant  to  carefully  choose  the  basis  for  the  socialized  user\u2019s  fee concept  because  it \nmay  also  deter  the  \u201cbetter  off\u201d  from  accessing  the  public  infrastructure  or  a  common \nservice in the community. They may decide to acquire privately a similar facility that they \nare  capable  of  obtaining,  and  this  will  be  a  potential  threat  to  sustainability.  Advocacy \neffort is very crucial. It is certain though that maintenance from user\u2019s fees is viable from \nthe present income and expenditure structure of rural households.  \n\nPrivate Investments in Rural Areas \n\nThe gap in the rural development strategies can be isolated from the fact that there \nare  fewer  employment  opportunities  from  private  establishments.  It  is  important  to \nencourage or provide incentives to private establishments to establish operation in rural \nareas.  This  incentive  should  primarily  consist  of  accessibility  development  to  reduce \ntransportation cost. Private investments in rural areas can help mitigate the vulnerability \nof  rural  households  when  they  become  independent  from  the  limitations  inherent  in \nagricultural production. Rural-urban  labor  migration  may  also  be  relieved.  This  will  also \nserve  as  the  catalyst  in  the  development  of  sustainable  microenterprises.  Private \nestablishments  with  a  sound  social  responsibility  program  can  also  contribute  to \nmitigating inequality.  \n\n \n\n51 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8 \n\nSUMMARY OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nParticipatory  Approach:  The  input  of  the  stakeholders  in  project  identification  is \nimportant  in  the  efficient  allocation  of  resources  and  to  pave  the  way  towards \nsustainability.  \n\nInfrastructure Development: Rural infrastructure development shall initiate from the \nconstruction/rehabilitation of rural roads followed by community organizing.  \n\nIncome Source Diversification: While income source diversification is important in \nmitigating economic vulnerability of rural households, it can lead to agricultural labor \nshortage, a possible threat to food security. There must be continuous research on \nlabor-efficient farming systems for a more viable rural development program. \n\nCredit:  An  intensive  advocacy  strategy  on  credit  is  needed.  A  portion  of  loan \nproceeds  for  agricultural  production  loans  should  be  set  aside  for  crop  insurance. \nMicroenterprise development, training on farming technologies, and the concept of a \ncooperative  should  be  considered  among  the  support  services  to  complement  the \ncredit program. \n\nBundles  of  Interventions:  Bundles  of  interventions  can  improve  production \nefficiency of the rural stakeholders at the farm or outside the farm.  \n\nSustainability: For sustainability, development assistance in rural areas should shift \ntowards  facilitation  of  access  to  production  inputs  and  support  services  rather  than \ndirect provision of such. \n\nUser\u2019s  Fees:  Financing  for  the  maintenance  of  infrastructure  should  come  from \npublic investment complemented with user\u2019s fees from existing infrastructure.  \n\nPrivate  Investments  in  Rural  Areas: Improvement of accessibility network among \nrural areas augmented with other incentives can encourage the relocation of private \ninvestments needed to push rural development.  \n\n  \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAppleton, S., Booth, D., 2001, Combining Participatory and Survey-Based Approaches to \nPoverty Monitoring and Analysis, Background Paper for the Workshop in Uganda. \n\nAsthana,  A.,  2003,  Decentralization  and  Supply  Efficiency:  The  Case  of  Rural  Water \n\nSupply in Central India, J. of Development Studies, 39(4):148-159. \n\nBalat,  J.  and  Porto,  G.,  2005,  Globalization  and  Complementary  Policies:  Poverty \nImpacts  in  Rural  Zambia,  NBER  Working  Paper  No.  11175,  National  Bureau  of \nEconomic Research. \n\nBale, M., 1999, The Rural Poor: A Thematic Approach, The World Bank: East Asia and \n\nPacific Region. \n\n52 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nBandiera,  O.,  (2002),  Land  Distribution,  Incentives  and  the  Choice  of  Production \nTechniques in Nicaragua, Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) Discussion \nPaper No. 3141. \n\nBarrett, C.

A starting point in \nmitigating  this  vulnerability  would  be  a  comprehensive  accessibility  improvement  that \nsubstantially  reduces  transportation  cost  and  isolation  of  the  rural  communities  from \nbasic  welfare  services.  An  advocacy  campaign  and/or  incentive  system  that  will \nencourage  private  firms  to  establish  operations  in  rural  areas  will  be  needed.  More \nprivate establishments in rural areas will not only shield the households against exposure \nto  vulnerability  but  will  also  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  microenterprise  development. \nSustainable rural development will follow provided that there is an ample corporate social \nresponsibility  program  among  these  firms  to  avert  widening  of  inequality.  A  natural \nresource management strategy will also be needed for ecological integrity.  \n", "Participation  is  crucial  in  development  project  identification  to  minimize  wastage  of \nresources  and  possibly  reallocate  it  to  other  productive  uses.  Provision  of  rural  roads \nshould  be  bundled  properly  with  support  services  and  capacity-building  activities.  This \ncan  enhance  the  demand  for  other  infrastructure  and  services  resulting  to  a  dynamic \nevolution  of  essential  elements  in  the  pursuit  of  rural  development.  Bundles  of \nintervention  improve  production  efficiency  of  rural  households  at  the  different  stages  of \nproduction in-farm and/or off-farm. \n", "Rural development interventions should pay special attention to the more vulnerable \nsegment,  the  farmers  especially,  with  the  goal  of  gradually  detaching  them  from \ncomplete dependence on agriculture without putting their food security at risk. \n", "Public investment on infrastructure and user\u2019s fees can complement each other in the \ncontinuous provision of new infrastructure and maintenance of the existing infrastructure, \nfor a sustainable track towards rural development. The socialized user\u2019s fee system is a \npotential tool for preventing the widening income disparity in rural areas. It is important \nhowever to carefully choose a suitable and acceptable basis for the socialized user\u2019s fee \nrates.  An  incorrect  choice  can  be  perceived  as  a  disincentive  for  access  or  might \nstimulate  distrust  among  a  segment  of  the  rural  society  regarding  the  sincerity  of  the \ngovernment  in  pushing  rural  development.  This  might  eventually  create  more  social \nissues rather than bridging inequality. \n", "Keywords: rural development, rural infrastructure, development intervention, household \n", "model, spatial autoregression \n", " \n", "2 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "1 \n", "INTRODUCTION \n", "The  Philippines  is  a  dominantly  agricultural  country.  Confinement  of  agricultural \nproduction  to  rural  areas  often  results  in  the  interchangeability  of  rural  and  agricultural \nissues.  As  of  the  2000  census,  the  population  was  estimated  at  76.5  million  with  52% \nresiding  in  rural  areas.  Labor  migration  in  favor  of  urban  centers  has  been  a  very \nprominent  social  phenomenon  in  the  last  two  decades,  causing  problems  both  in  rural \nareas (agricultural labor shortage) and in urban ones (primarily congestion).  \n", "A  large  portion  of  land  is  still  classified  as  rural  but  the  contribution  of  agriculture, \nfishery  and  forestry  to  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has  been  declining  since  the \n70\u2019s. In 1975, a few years after the Green Revolution program was launched, the output \nof  agriculture  sector  accounted  for  29%  of  the  GDP.  In  1987,  under  the  new \nadministration  benefiting  from  the  political  events  in  1986,  the  share  of  agriculture \ndropped  to  25%.  Ironically  in  1990,  more  than  a  year  after  the  implementation  of  the \nComprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program  (CARP),  the  share  of  agriculture  dropped \nfurther  to  22%.  In  2005,  the  structure  of  the  economy  was  such  that  service  sector \naccounted for 53%, industries for 33%, and agriculture, fishery and forestry for only 14% \nof the GDP. \n", "The  declining  share  of  the  agriculture  sector  in  the  national  economy  may  also  be \ntaken as a proximate indicator of rural development. The thrust of interventions towards \nrural  development  and  poverty  alleviation  has  been  on  the  diversification  of  livelihood \nactivities. This could have potentially contributed to the increasing share of services and \nindustries  while  keeping  a  large  portion  of  the  population  in  the  rural  areas.  There  are \nemerging  small-scale  industries  and  value-adding  activities  whose  effects  yield  an \nincreasing share of the industries and services to the national economy. Some formerly \nurban-operating  agencies  could  also  be  relocated  to  the  rural  areas  as  a  result  of  the \nimprovement of infrastructure and support services.  \n", "Since  1985,  the  proportion  of  households  engaged  in  agricultural  activities  has \nfluctuated from 34% to 41%, clearly a sign of lower productivity in the sector since GDP \ncontribution  is  much  lower  than  these  numbers.  This  judgment  is  further  supported  by \nthe employment rate in agriculture, fishing and forestry, which was recorded at 43.4% in \n1995 and fell to 36.6% in 2006.  \n", "Marginalization of households in rural areas can be illustrated by poverty indicators. \nA comparative poverty incidence in rural and urban areas is given in Table 1.1. In 1985, \nthe poverty incidence in rural areas is about one-third more than that in urban areas. In \n2000,  rural  poverty  incidence  is  more  than  double  that  in  urban  areas,  implying  that \npoverty  alleviation  in  the  urban  Philippines  is  working  much  more  quickly  than  its  rural \ncounterpart. \n", "3 \n"]}
