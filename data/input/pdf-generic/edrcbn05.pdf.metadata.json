The consensus view is that\nthe objective of setting the central parity should be to maintain com-\npetitiveness(cid:151)that is, the central parity should track the long-run\nequilibrium effective exchange rate reflecting the relative impor-\ntance of various trading partners to the extent possible(cid:151)to prevent\nexpectations of discrete realignments. This means adjusting the\nparity not only in accordance with the domestic(cid:150)foreign inflation\ndifferential but also in accordance with changes in the underlying\nequilibrium real exchange rates, which are driven by permanent\nchanges in fundamental factors such as terms of trade, productiv-\nity, and saving rates.\n\nGiven that the central parity should seek to track the long-term\nequilibrium real exchange rate, the next issues are how wide the\nband should be and how much intervention should take place within\nit. The desirable width of the band depends on the value to the do-\nmestic economy of an independent domestic monetary policy. The\nwider the band the greater the scope for an independent domestic\nmonetary policy. In turn, the usefulness of an independent monetary\npolicy for reducing volatility depends on the availability of alterna-\ntive stabilization instruments (e.g., fiscal policy) and on the sources\nof shocks to the economy. The traditional analysis of this issue\nfocuses on the nature of the shocks, the standard prescription being\nthat, holding the fiscal policy constant, domestic real shocks call for\nexchange  rate  flexibility,  while  nominal  shocks  call  for  fixed\nexchange rates. This suggests that if fiscal policy is not available as\na  stabilization  tool,  countries  in  which  domestic  real  shocks\npredominate should adopt fairly wide bands, while those in which\ndomestic nominal shocks predominate should keep the exchange\nrate close to its parity. However, with a flexible fiscal policy, domestic\nreal shocks can be countered through fiscal adjustment, thereby\ndiminishing the value of independent monetary policy as a stabili-\nzation instrument. Thus the adoption of a fairly narrow band is more\nlikely to be consistent with the stabilization objective if fiscal policy\nis available as a stabilization instrument. Regarding intervention\nwithin the band, active intervention should accompany nominal\nshocks, whereas real shocks instead call for some combination of\nexchange rate and fiscal adjustment.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA lthough inappropriate exchange rate policies are not a root\n\ncause of  the financial crisis  in  East  and Southeast Asian\ncountries  (Indonesia,  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,\nPhilippines, and Thailand) such policies have contributed to the\ncrisis.  By the early 1980s, all of the affected countries had moved\naway from the old policy of pegging to the US dollar toward more\nflexible exchange rate regimes of basket-pegging or managed\n(cid:147)dirty(cid:148) float. But the extensive intervention policies of the central\nbanks meant that exchange rates were de facto pegged to the dollar.\nIt is argued that the de facto dollar peg policy contributed to\nvulnerability in two ways. First, the strengthening of the dollar vis-\n(cid:224)-vis the yen after mid-1995 led to an appreciation of the affected\ncurrencies and, thereby, to a loss of export competitiveness and cur-\nrent account pressures. Also by increasing the relative profitability\nof the nontradable sector, the fixed exchange rate encouraged in-\nvestments in real estate. By contrast, the dollar peg policy served\nwell during 1985 to mid-1995, when the dollar weakened against the\nyen and fueled export-led growth in East Asia. Second, low ex-\nchange rate variability and the predictable pattern of exchange rates\nunder the de facto pegged regime reduced foreign exchange risk for\nthe debtors and creditors and led to large surges of short-term capi-\ntal held in unhedged positions.\n\nPresently, all of the affected countries have adopted a policy\nof managed (cid:147)dirty(cid:148) float where the exchange rate is essentially de-\ntermined  by  market  forces  albeit  with  sporadic  central  bank\nintervention. This note addresses issues such as: What would be an\noptimal exchange rate regime for these countries in the medium\nterm? Should they be more rule-based? These issues are  relevant\nnot only for the affected countries but also for those that are vulner-\nable to the forces of globalization.\n\n1. See ADB (1998) for a discussion of the root causes of the crisis. Recently,\nNobel laureate James Tobin has identified fixed exchange rates in these countries\nas the main culprits.\n\n\f2\n\n11\n\nEXCHANGE RATE REGIMES AND MOVEMENTS\n\nBox 2:  Currency Boards\n\nExchange Rate Regimes\n\nThe trends in exchange rate regimes of the affected countries\nare presented in Table 1. As part of their outward-oriented develop-\nment strategies, by early 1973, Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea),\nMalaysia, and Philippines had adopted a more flexible exchange\nrate regime of managed float. Only Indonesia and Thailand pegged\ntheir currencies to the dollar. Subsequently, in 1978, these two coun-\ntries also moved toward greater de jure flexibility in exchange rate\nmanagement(cid:151)Thailand by pegging to a basket of currencies and\nIndonesia by adopting a regime of managed float. By 1980, there-\nfore, all of the affected countries had abandoned the single currency\npeg regime. Malaysia and Thailand attempted to stabilize the prices\nof traded goods by pegging to a currency basket, while Indonesia,\nKorea, and Philippines moved directly to a managed float regime\nwith the primary objective of attaining policy independence. Be-\ntween 1981 and 1992, the implicit dollar weight in the currencies\nof the affected countries ranged from 75 percent to 100 percent.\n\nBilateral Exchange Rates\n\nExchange rate regimes in the affected countries became much\nmore flexible after 1980. This is evident, for instance, from the analy-\nsis of nominal bilateral exchange rate changes in Table 2. Currency\nadjustments vis-(cid:224)-vis the dollar were generally much smaller dur-\ning 1976-1981 than subsequently.\n\nThe classification of exchange rate regimes based on officially\nannounced intervention policies could be misleading as actual\nexchange rate management might differ from the stated objectives.\nA floating regime might be (cid:147)dirty(cid:148) so as to achieve a result that is\na little different from formal pegging. Conversely, countries that\nmaintain a pegged system may make frequent adjustments so that\nthe results resemble floating rates. Indeed, an analysis of data in\nTable 2 suggests that the affected countries continued to closely\npeg their currencies to the dollar. Though the dollar weakened\nsignificantly against the yen, Deutsche mark, and British pound\n\nCurrency boards have been adopted in  a number of countries\nas a means of enforcing financial discipline especially from initial\ncircumstances of financial instability. Although both a standard peg\nand a currency board aim to maintain fixed exchange rates, the cur-\nrency board goes one step further: it limits the permissible increase\nin domestic currency to the stock of foreign reserves, and allows the\nfree conversion between the domestic and the backing currency at\nthe announced rates. The currency board, in the pure form, cannot\nact as the lender of last resort and extend credit to the government,\nbanks, or anyone else. By sharply limiting the ability of the board to\nconduct discretionary monetary policy, it is hoped the credibility gains\nwould be more pronounced and immediate.\n\nFor the successful implementation of a currency board, two\npreconditions have to be fulfilled. First, the commitment to exchange\nmonetary liabilities for foreign currency at the fixed rate requires that\nthe currency board  have sufficient foreign exchange reserves to\nhonor this commitment. This ideally means that its foreign reserves\nshould at least equal the value of its monetary liabilities. Second,\ngiven the absence of a lender of last resort, governments and banks\nmust show financial discipline. The former must commit themselves\nto appropriately tight fiscal positions and the latter must be ad-\nequately robust so that they can function without additional credit\nfrom the lender of last resort.\n\nUnless the above commitments are fulfilled, a currency board\nwould not be credible. This is critical because in the absence of con-\nfidence, the financial community may view the arrangement not as\na mechanism for restoring stability, but merely as an opportunity to\nconvert financial assets into foreign exchange at an attractive rate.\nA currency board that is not credible also provides an inviting target\nfor speculators and hedge funds.\n\n\f10\n\n3\n\n  Box 1:  Considerations in the Choice of Exchange Rate Regime\n\nTable 1: Exchange Rate Regimes of the Affected Countries\n\nCharacteristics of Economy\n\nImplications for the Desired Degree\nof Exchange Rate Flexibility\n\nSize of economy\n\nOpenness\n\nThe larger the economy, the stronger is the\ncase for a flexible rate.\n\nThe  more  open  the  economy,  the  less\nattractive is a flexible exchange rate.\n\nDiversified production/export\nstructure\n\nThe more diversified the economy, the more\nfeasible is a flexible exchange rate.\n\nGeographic concentration of trade\n\nThe larger the proportion of an economy\u2019s\ntrade with one large country, the greater is\nthe incentive to peg to the currency of that\ncountry.\n\nThe more divergent a country(cid:146)s inflation\nrate from that of its main trading partners,\nthe greater is the need for  frequent ex-\nchange rate adjustments.  (But for a country\nwith extremely high  inflation, a fixed ex-\nchange rate may  provide greater policy\ndiscipline and credibility to a stabilization\nprogram).\n\nThe greater the degree of economic and\nfinancial development, the more feasible is\na flexible exchange rate regime.\n\nThe greater the degree of labor mobility,\nwhen wages and prices are downwardly\nsticky, the less difficult (and costly) is the\nadjustment to external shocks with a fixed\nexchange rate.\n\nThe higher the degree of capital mobility,\nthe more difficult it is to sustain a pegged-\nbut-adjustable  exchange rate regime.\n\nThe more prevalent the foreign nominal\nshocks, the more desirable is a flexible\nexchange rate.\n\nThe more prevalent the domestic nominal\nshocks, the more attractive is a fixed ex-\nchange rate.\n\nThe greater an economy(cid:146)s susceptibility to\nreal shocks, whether foreign or domestic,\nthe more advantageous is a flexible ex-\nchange rate.\n\nThe lower the anti-inflation credibility of\npolicymakers, the greater is the attractive-\nness of a fixed exchange rate as a nominal\nanchor.\n\nDivergence of domestic inflation\nfrom world inflation\n\nDegree of economic/financial\ndevelopment\n\nLabor mobility\n\nCapital mobility\n\nForeign nominal shocks\n\nDomestic nominal shocks\n\nReal shocks\n\nCredibility of policymakers\n\nSource:  IMF (1997b).\n\nIndonesia\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nNotes:\n\n1973\n\nPS($)\n\nMF\n\nMFb\n\nMF\n\nPS($)\n\n1980\n\nMFa\n\nMF\n\nPBc\n\nMF\n\nPBd\n\n1996\n\nDec 1997\n\nMF\n\nMF\n\nPB\n\nMF\n\nPB\n\nMF\n\nMF\n\nMF\n\nMF\n\nMF\n\nPS($): Pegged to a single currency (US dollar)\nPB:\nPegged to a basket of currencies\nMF: Managed or (cid:147)dirty(cid:148) float\n\na Beginning November 1978.\nb Beginning June 1973.\nc Beginning September 1975.\nd Beginning November 1978.\n\nSources: Dowling et al.

During\n1995-1996, the dollar strengthened vis-(cid:224)-vis the yen, but again the\ncurrencies of the affected countries were relatively stable. Thus, the\ncurrencies of the affected countries were more or less pegged to the\ndollar.\n\nNominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates\n\nAnother useful analysis of exchange rate policies can be pro-\nvided by examining movements in the nominal effective exchange\nrates (NEERs) and real effective exchange rates (REERs). While\nconsiderable controversy exists in the literature on how to measure\nit, the REER, in particular, is a good proxy for a country\u2019s interna-\ntional competitiveness as it measures the relative price of tradables\nversus nontradables. In the REER index computation, bilateral\nnominal exchange rates adjusted for relative inflation rates are\nweighted by the importance of partner countries.\n\nFigure 1 shows that the affected countries experienced consid-\nerable  fluctuations  in  their  effective  exchange  rates.  During\n1981-1996, all affected currencies depreciated in nominal effective\nterms. In Malaysia and Thailand, domestic inflation was close to\ninflation in trading partner currencies and the export competitive-\nness gained through nominal exchange rate depreciation was\nmaintained. In the other countries, domestic inflation was higher\nthan foreign inflation. Despite that, Indonesia and Korea were suc-\ncessful in targeting the REER between the late 1980s and 1996. Only\nin the Philippines did the REER appreciate, although slightly, and\na certain amount of export competitiveness was lost.\n\nThe pace of nominal and real effective depreciation of the af-\nfected  currencies  accelerated  sharply  in  1997  with  the  deep\ndevaluations beginning in Thailand in July 1997. McKinnon (1998)\nhas  suggested nudging all currencies upward through regional\ncoordination. If exchange appreciation were tried in only one coun-\ntry, it would lack credibility when the currencies of its competitors\nremained undervalued.\n\nfor future speculative attacks. On the other hand, a floating system\nwould bring about considerable volatility in the exchange rates of\nthe affected countries where financial markets are not well devel-\noped and foreign markets are thin. In such a situation, a few large\ntransactions could cause large short-term exchange rate movements.\nIn light of these problems, an intermediate regime of managed float\nis worth considering.2\n\nUnder the managed float regime, one possibility is to retain the\npresent (cid:147)dirty(cid:148) float in which the nominal exchange rate is essen-\ntially determined by market forces with sporadic central bank\nintervention.3 The other is to move to an officially determined(cid:151)but\nbetter managed(cid:151)exchange rate regime within a band, or a crawl-\ning peg system. The difference between the two is that in the\ncrawling peg system,  the monetary authorities make specific com-\nmitments about the path of the real exchange rate, as well as about\nthe range of variability of the nominal exchange rate. In the medium\nterm and as credibility of the affected countries is restored, the move\nto a crawling peg system may be advisable as it combines the ad-\nvantages of both fixed and flexible exchange rates. It helps to impose\ndiscipline on policies, but it still provides flexibility if the country\nis hit by surges in capital flows. By allowing some uncertainty about\nthe exchange rate, the band would reduce incentives for heavy cur-\nrency borrowing. Chile, Israel, and Mexico have had favorable\nexperience with the crawling peg system (Helpman, Liederman, and\nBufman 1994).\n\nThe crawling peg system is not, however, a panacea. Indonesia\nadopted the system in 1978 and widened the band on several oc-\ncasions(cid:151)most recently in 1997 from 8 to 12 percent;  nonetheless,\nIndonesia was subject to speculative attacks, most notably in early\n1998.\n\n2. After falling into a disrepute because of their colonial shadows, currency\nboards have staged a revival most recently in Indonesia. However, as argued in\nBox 2, this idea also lacks credibility in the affected countries at the present time.\nThis situation could, of course, change in the future as recovery proceeds and the\ninternational reserve position of the countries improve.\n\n3. The regime is closer to free floating because the affected countries are fac-\n\ning a serious shortage of intervention currency.\n\n\f8\n\n5\n\nFigure 1: Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rate Indexes\n\nIndonesia\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nOPTIMAL EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES\n\nThere are basically two approaches in the determination of\noptimal exchange rate regimes. The early literature on the subject\nwas based on the theory of optimum currency area and focused on\nthe characteristics that determined whether a country would be bet-\nter off, in terms of maintaining internal and external balance, with\ndifferent choices of exchange rate regimes. For example, small open\neconomies are better served by a fixed exchange rate regime. Also\nthe less diversified a country(cid:146)s production and export structures, the\nstronger the case for fixed exchange rates becomes.\n\nAnother approach to the choice of exchange rate regime\nfocuses on the effects of random disturbances on the domestic\neconomy. The optimal regime in this framework is the one that\nstabilizes macroeconomic performance, that is, minimizes the fluc-\ntuations of output, prices, or other macroeconomic variables. This\napproach typically finds that a system of fixed exchange rates is\nsuperior if the disturbances impinging on the economy are predomi-\nnantly domestic nominal shocks (e.g., interest rate changes),\nwhereas a flexible regime is preferable if disturbances are foreign\n(e.g., terms of trade) or domestic real shocks (e.g., famines). The\nvarious considerations and their implications for exchange rate\nregimes summarized by the International Monetary Fund are given\nin Box 1.\n\nHow do the affected countries fare against the checklist in\nBox 1? At first glance, they are relatively small, highly open econo-\nmies where imports account for more than 40 percent of GDP, twice\nthe average for developing countries. Inflation rates are also modest\nby developing country standards and labor markets are relatively\nflexible at least in most of the countries. In other words, floating rates\nare probably not the best option. But then again they are small open\neconomies with relatively open capital accounts and are vulnerable\nto external shocks. The affected countries also rely extensively on\nforeign investors to finance their investment requirements. There-\nfore, a rigid exchange rate regime may not be the most suitable.\n\nCredibility of regimes is also important. In the context of the\nongoing crisis with severe banking sector problems and low levels\nof reserves, the return to an announced peg is an open invitation\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nThailand\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\nNominal\n\ns Real\n\nNote: Data as of end-December.\nSource: Institute of World Economics, Kiel, Germany\n\n\f6\n\n7\n\nAside from the longer-term trends discussed in the previous\nparagraph, it is also useful to examine trends over shorter intervals.\nSuch an analysis in Tables 3 and 4 is consistent with the two hypo-\ntheses discussed above:\n\n(i) The de facto dollar pegging policy led to a depreciation of\nthe affected currencies in nominal effective terms during\nthe 1985-1989 and 1990-1994 periods, when the dollar was\nweak (Table 3). The rate of depreciation slowed or turned\ninto an appreciation (in Malaysia) during 1995-1996,\nwhen the dollar strengthened in world markets.\n\n(ii) The real effective exchange rates of the affected countries\nfollowed a similar depreciating trend during 1985-1994,\nexcept in the Philippines (where it appreciated slightly,\nTable 4). However, the rates appreciated during 1995-1996\n(cid:151)by about 3 percent per annum in Thailand; about 2 per-\ncent in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand;\nand less than 1 percent in Korea.\n\n(iii) Real exchange rate appreciation could have led to an ex-\nport slowdown in the affected countries. By estimating\nexport demand functions for a wide range of Asian coun-\ntries using quarterly data during 1970-1979, Bautista\n(1981) found that real currency appreciation led to export\nslowdowns.

The rate of depreciation slowed or turned\ninto an appreciation (in Malaysia) during 1995-1996,\nwhen the dollar strengthened in world markets.\n\n(ii) The real effective exchange rates of the affected countries\nfollowed a similar depreciating trend during 1985-1994,\nexcept in the Philippines (where it appreciated slightly,\nTable 4). However, the rates appreciated during 1995-1996\n(cid:151)by about 3 percent per annum in Thailand; about 2 per-\ncent in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand;\nand less than 1 percent in Korea.\n\n(iii) Real exchange rate appreciation could have led to an ex-\nport slowdown in the affected countries. By estimating\nexport demand functions for a wide range of Asian coun-\ntries using quarterly data during 1970-1979, Bautista\n(1981) found that real currency appreciation led to export\nslowdowns. Similarly, Rana (1983) found that in Asian\ncountries, the exchange rate as well as its variability  was\nan important determinant of imports.\n\n(iv) The de facto dollar pegging policy also led to relative sta-\nbility in the currencies of the affected countries (last two\ncolumns of Table 2).

The early literature on the subject\nwas based on the theory of optimum currency area and focused on\nthe characteristics that determined whether a country would be bet-\nter off, in terms of maintaining internal and external balance, with\ndifferent choices of exchange rate regimes. For example, small open\neconomies are better served by a fixed exchange rate regime. Also\nthe less diversified a country(cid:146)s production and export structures, the\nstronger the case for fixed exchange rates becomes.\n\nAnother approach to the choice of exchange rate regime\nfocuses on the effects of random disturbances on the domestic\neconomy. The optimal regime in this framework is the one that\nstabilizes macroeconomic performance, that is, minimizes the fluc-\ntuations of output, prices, or other macroeconomic variables. This\napproach typically finds that a system of fixed exchange rates is\nsuperior if the disturbances impinging on the economy are predomi-\nnantly domestic nominal shocks (e.g., interest rate changes),\nwhereas a flexible regime is preferable if disturbances are foreign\n(e.g., terms of trade) or domestic real shocks (e.g., famines). The\nvarious considerations and their implications for exchange rate\nregimes summarized by the International Monetary Fund are given\nin Box 1.\n\nHow do the affected countries fare against the checklist in\nBox 1? At first glance, they are relatively small, highly open econo-\nmies where imports account for more than 40 percent of GDP, twice\nthe average for developing countries. Inflation rates are also modest\nby developing country standards and labor markets are relatively\nflexible at least in most of the countries. In other words, floating rates\nare probably not the best option. But then again they are small open\neconomies with relatively open capital accounts and are vulnerable\nto external shocks. The affected countries also rely extensively on\nforeign investors to finance their investment requirements. There-\nfore, a rigid exchange rate regime may not be the most suitable.\n\nCredibility of regimes is also important. In the context of the\nongoing crisis with severe banking sector problems and low levels\nof reserves, the return to an announced peg is an open invitation\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nThailand\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83 84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87 88 89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92 93 94 95 96 97\n\nNominal\n\ns Real\n\nNote: Data as of end-December.\nSource: Institute of World Economics, Kiel, Germany\n\n\f4\n\n9\n\nduring the periods 1985-1989 and 1990-1994, the currencies of the\naffected countries were remarkably stable vis-(cid:224)-vis the dollar (espe-\ncially the Malaysian ringgit, Philippine peso, and Thai baht). During\n1995-1996, the dollar strengthened vis-(cid:224)-vis the yen, but again the\ncurrencies of the affected countries were relatively stable. Thus, the\ncurrencies of the affected countries were more or less pegged to the\ndollar.\n\nNominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates\n\nAnother useful analysis of exchange rate policies can be pro-\nvided by examining movements in the nominal effective exchange\nrates (NEERs) and real effective exchange rates (REERs). While\nconsiderable controversy exists in the literature on how to measure\nit, the REER, in particular, is a good proxy for a country\u2019s interna-\ntional competitiveness as it measures the relative price of tradables\nversus nontradables. In the REER index computation, bilateral\nnominal exchange rates adjusted for relative inflation rates are\nweighted by the importance of partner countries.\n\nFigure 1 shows that the affected countries experienced consid-\nerable  fluctuations  in  their  effective  exchange  rates.  During\n1981-1996, all affected currencies depreciated in nominal effective\nterms. In Malaysia and Thailand, domestic inflation was close to\ninflation in trading partner currencies and the export competitive-\nness gained through nominal exchange rate depreciation was\nmaintained. In the other countries, domestic inflation was higher\nthan foreign inflation. Despite that, Indonesia and Korea were suc-\ncessful in targeting the REER between the late 1980s and 1996. Only\nin the Philippines did the REER appreciate, although slightly, and\na certain amount of export competitiveness was lost.\n\nThe pace of nominal and real effective depreciation of the af-\nfected  currencies  accelerated  sharply  in  1997  with  the  deep\ndevaluations beginning in Thailand in July 1997. McKinnon (1998)\nhas  suggested nudging all currencies upward through regional\ncoordination. If exchange appreciation were tried in only one coun-\ntry, it would lack credibility when the currencies of its competitors\nremained undervalued.\n\nfor future speculative attacks. On the other hand, a floating system\nwould bring about considerable volatility in the exchange rates of\nthe affected countries where financial markets are not well devel-\noped and foreign markets are thin. In such a situation, a few large\ntransactions could cause large short-term exchange rate movements.\nIn light of these problems, an intermediate regime of managed float\nis worth considering.2\n\nUnder the managed float regime, one possibility is to retain the\npresent (cid:147)dirty(cid:148) float in which the nominal exchange rate is essen-\ntially determined by market forces with sporadic central bank\nintervention.3 The other is to move to an officially determined(cid:151)but\nbetter managed(cid:151)exchange rate regime within a band, or a crawl-\ning peg system. The difference between the two is that in the\ncrawling peg system,  the monetary authorities make specific com-\nmitments about the path of the real exchange rate, as well as about\nthe range of variability of the nominal exchange rate. In the medium\nterm and as credibility of the affected countries is restored, the move\nto a crawling peg system may be advisable as it combines the ad-\nvantages of both fixed and flexible exchange rates. It helps to impose\ndiscipline on policies, but it still provides flexibility if the country\nis hit by surges in capital flows. By allowing some uncertainty about\nthe exchange rate, the band would reduce incentives for heavy cur-\nrency borrowing. Chile, Israel, and Mexico have had favorable\nexperience with the crawling peg system (Helpman, Liederman, and\nBufman 1994).\n\nThe crawling peg system is not, however, a panacea. Indonesia\nadopted the system in 1978 and widened the band on several oc-\ncasions(cid:151)most recently in 1997 from 8 to 12 percent;  nonetheless,\nIndonesia was subject to speculative attacks, most notably in early\n1998.\n\n2. After falling into a disrepute because of their colonial shadows, currency\nboards have staged a revival most recently in Indonesia. However, as argued in\nBox 2, this idea also lacks credibility in the affected countries at the present time.\nThis situation could, of course, change in the future as recovery proceeds and the\ninternational reserve position of the countries improve.\n\n3. The regime is closer to free floating because the affected countries are fac-\n\ning a serious shortage of intervention currency.\n\n\f10\n\n3\n\n  Box 1:  Considerations in the Choice of Exchange Rate Regime\n\nTable 1: Exchange Rate Regimes of the Affected Countries\n\nCharacteristics of Economy\n\nImplications for the Desired Degree\nof Exchange Rate Flexibility\n\nSize of economy\n\nOpenness\n\nThe larger the economy, the stronger is the\ncase for a flexible rate.\n\nThe  more  open  the  economy,  the  less\nattractive is a flexible exchange rate.\n\nDiversified production/export\nstructure\n\nThe more diversified the economy, the more\nfeasible is a flexible exchange rate.\n\nGeographic concentration of trade\n\nThe larger the proportion of an economy\u2019s\ntrade with one large country, the greater is\nthe incentive to peg to the currency of that\ncountry.\n\nThe more divergent a country(cid:146)s inflation\nrate from that of its main trading partners,\nthe greater is the need for  frequent ex-\nchange rate adjustments.

As part of their outward-oriented develop-\nment strategies, by early 1973, Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea),\nMalaysia, and Philippines had adopted a more flexible exchange\nrate regime of managed float. Only Indonesia and Thailand pegged\ntheir currencies to the dollar. Subsequently, in 1978, these two coun-\ntries also moved toward greater de jure flexibility in exchange rate\nmanagement(cid:151)Thailand by pegging to a basket of currencies and\nIndonesia by adopting a regime of managed float. By 1980, there-\nfore, all of the affected countries had abandoned the single currency\npeg regime. Malaysia and Thailand attempted to stabilize the prices\nof traded goods by pegging to a currency basket, while Indonesia,\nKorea, and Philippines moved directly to a managed float regime\nwith the primary objective of attaining policy independence. Be-\ntween 1981 and 1992, the implicit dollar weight in the currencies\nof the affected countries ranged from 75 percent to 100 percent.\n\nBilateral Exchange Rates\n\nExchange rate regimes in the affected countries became much\nmore flexible after 1980. This is evident, for instance, from the analy-\nsis of nominal bilateral exchange rate changes in Table 2. Currency\nadjustments vis-(cid:224)-vis the dollar were generally much smaller dur-\ning 1976-1981 than subsequently.\n\nThe classification of exchange rate regimes based on officially\nannounced intervention policies could be misleading as actual\nexchange rate management might differ from the stated objectives.\nA floating regime might be (cid:147)dirty(cid:148) so as to achieve a result that is\na little different from formal pegging. Conversely, countries that\nmaintain a pegged system may make frequent adjustments so that\nthe results resemble floating rates. Indeed, an analysis of data in\nTable 2 suggests that the affected countries continued to closely\npeg their currencies to the dollar. Though the dollar weakened\nsignificantly against the yen, Deutsche mark, and British pound\n\nCurrency boards have been adopted in  a number of countries\nas a means of enforcing financial discipline especially from initial\ncircumstances of financial instability. Although both a standard peg\nand a currency board aim to maintain fixed exchange rates, the cur-\nrency board goes one step further: it limits the permissible increase\nin domestic currency to the stock of foreign reserves, and allows the\nfree conversion between the domestic and the backing currency at\nthe announced rates. The currency board, in the pure form, cannot\nact as the lender of last resort and extend credit to the government,\nbanks, or anyone else. By sharply limiting the ability of the board to\nconduct discretionary monetary policy, it is hoped the credibility gains\nwould be more pronounced and immediate.\n\nFor the successful implementation of a currency board, two\npreconditions have to be fulfilled. First, the commitment to exchange\nmonetary liabilities for foreign currency at the fixed rate requires that\nthe currency board  have sufficient foreign exchange reserves to\nhonor this commitment. This ideally means that its foreign reserves\nshould at least equal the value of its monetary liabilities. Second,\ngiven the absence of a lender of last resort, governments and banks\nmust show financial discipline. The former must commit themselves\nto appropriately tight fiscal positions and the latter must be ad-\nequately robust so that they can function without additional credit\nfrom the lender of last resort.\n\nUnless the above commitments are fulfilled, a currency board\nwould not be credible. This is critical because in the absence of con-\nfidence, the financial community may view the arrangement not as\na mechanism for restoring stability, but merely as an opportunity to\nconvert financial assets into foreign exchange at an attractive rate.\nA currency board that is not credible also provides an inviting target\nfor speculators and hedge funds.\n\n\f12\n\nThe decisions that need to be made to manage a crawling peg\nsystem consists of how to adjust the parity, how wide to set the band,\nand how to intervene within the band. The consensus view is that\nthe objective of setting the central parity should be to maintain com-\npetitiveness(cid:151)that is, the central parity should track the long-run\nequilibrium effective exchange rate reflecting the relative impor-\ntance of various trading partners to the extent possible(cid:151)to prevent\nexpectations of discrete realignments. This means adjusting the\nparity not only in accordance with the domestic(cid:150)foreign inflation\ndifferential but also in accordance with changes in the underlying\nequilibrium real exchange rates, which are driven by permanent\nchanges in fundamental factors such as terms of trade, productiv-\nity, and saving rates.\n\nGiven that the central parity should seek to track the long-term\nequilibrium real exchange rate, the next issues are how wide the\nband should be and how much intervention should take place within\nit. The desirable width of the band depends on the value to the do-\nmestic economy of an independent domestic monetary policy. The\nwider the band the greater the scope for an independent domestic\nmonetary policy. In turn, the usefulness of an independent monetary\npolicy for reducing volatility depends on the availability of alterna-\ntive stabilization instruments (e.g., fiscal policy) and on the sources\nof shocks to the economy. The traditional analysis of this issue\nfocuses on the nature of the shocks, the standard prescription being\nthat, holding the fiscal policy constant, domestic real shocks call for\nexchange  rate  flexibility,  while  nominal  shocks  call  for  fixed\nexchange rates. This suggests that if fiscal policy is not available as\na  stabilization  tool,  countries  in  which  domestic  real  shocks\npredominate should adopt fairly wide bands, while those in which\ndomestic nominal shocks predominate should keep the exchange\nrate close to its parity. However, with a flexible fiscal policy, domestic\nreal shocks can be countered through fiscal adjustment, thereby\ndiminishing the value of independent monetary policy as a stabili-\nzation instrument. Thus the adoption of a fairly narrow band is more\nlikely to be consistent with the stabilization objective if fiscal policy\nis available as a stabilization instrument. Regarding intervention\nwithin the band, active intervention should accompany nominal\nshocks, whereas real shocks instead call for some combination of\nexchange rate and fiscal adjustment.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA lthough inappropriate exchange rate policies are not a root\n\ncause of  the financial crisis  in  East  and Southeast Asian\ncountries  (Indonesia,  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,\nPhilippines, and Thailand) such policies have contributed to the\ncrisis.  By the early 1980s, all of the affected countries had moved\naway from the old policy of pegging to the US dollar toward more\nflexible exchange rate regimes of basket-pegging or managed\n(cid:147)dirty(cid:148) float. But the extensive intervention policies of the central\nbanks meant that exchange rates were de facto pegged to the dollar.\nIt is argued that the de facto dollar peg policy contributed to\nvulnerability in two ways. First, the strengthening of the dollar vis-\n(cid:224)-vis the yen after mid-1995 led to an appreciation of the affected\ncurrencies and, thereby, to a loss of export competitiveness and cur-\nrent account pressures. Also by increasing the relative profitability\nof the nontradable sector, the fixed exchange rate encouraged in-\nvestments in real estate. By contrast, the dollar peg policy served\nwell during 1985 to mid-1995, when the dollar weakened against the\nyen and fueled export-led growth in East Asia. Second, low ex-\nchange rate variability and the predictable pattern of exchange rates\nunder the de facto pegged regime reduced foreign exchange risk for\nthe debtors and creditors and led to large surges of short-term capi-\ntal held in unhedged positions.\n\nPresently, all of the affected countries have adopted a policy\nof managed (cid:147)dirty(cid:148) float where the exchange rate is essentially de-\ntermined  by  market  forces  albeit  with  sporadic  central  bank\nintervention. This note addresses issues such as: What would be an\noptimal exchange rate regime for these countries in the medium\nterm? Should they be more rule-based? These issues are  relevant\nnot only for the affected countries but also for those that are vulner-\nable to the forces of globalization.\n\n1. See ADB (1998) for a discussion of the root causes of the crisis. Recently,\nNobel laureate James Tobin has identified fixed exchange rates in these countries\nas the main culprits.\n\n\f13\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe exchange rate is a highly visible indicator and a key policy\nvariable in determining a country\u2019s economic well-being. During the\npost-1995 strong dollar period, the East Asian countries should have\ndelinked their currencies from the dollar in order to improve export\ncompetitiveness. They should have also permitted greater flexibil-\nity of their exchange rates for two reasons: (i) to reduce incentives\nfor currency speculation and excessive inflow of foreign capital, and\n(ii) to acquire greater independence of macroeconomic policies.\nFailure to do so contributed to the crisis, although inappropriate\nexchange rate policies were not the root causes of the East Asian\nfinancial crisis.\n\nIn the post-crisis period, the affected countries have moved to\na de facto (cid:147)free(cid:148) float regime. In the medium term and as credibil-\nity is established, they may consider adopting the more orderly\nsystem of a crawling peg as in the case of several Latin American\ncountries and Israel. But crawling pegs alone cannot be a panacea.\nA proper mix of monetary sterilization, fiscal flexibility, and greater\nexchange rate flexibility is an appropriate policy response by the\naffected countries to maximize the benefits of globalization of finan-\ncial markets and to reduce its challenges. This combination of\nmacroeconomic policies is also applicable to other vulnerable\nDMCs. In the choice of an exchange rate regime, however, they may\nalso consider the existing differences in the other determinants such\nas size, diversification, and degree of openness.\n\n\f14\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAsian Development Bank, 1998.
