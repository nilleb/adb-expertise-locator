During the\npost-1995 strong dollar period, the East Asian countries should have\ndelinked their currencies from the dollar in order to improve export\ncompetitiveness. They should have also permitted greater flexibil-\nity of their exchange rates for two reasons: (i) to reduce incentives\nfor currency speculation and excessive inflow of foreign capital, and\n(ii) to acquire greater independence of macroeconomic policies.\nFailure to do so contributed to the crisis, although inappropriate\nexchange rate policies were not the root causes of the East Asian\nfinancial crisis.\nIn the post-crisis period, the affected countries have moved to\na de facto (cid:147)free(cid:148) float regime. In the medium term and as credibil-\nity is established, they may consider adopting the more orderly\nsystem of a crawling peg as in the case of several Latin American\ncountries and Israel. But crawling pegs alone cannot be a panacea.\nA proper mix of monetary sterilization, fiscal flexibility, and greater\nexchange rate flexibility is an appropriate policy response by the\naffected countries to maximize the benefits of globalization of finan-\ncial markets and to reduce its challenges. This combination of\nmacroeconomic policies is also applicable to other vulnerable\nDMCs.
