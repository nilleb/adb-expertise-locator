INTRODUCTION \n\nS. Shirai \n\nIn  January  2013,  the  Bank  of  Japan  (BOJ),  led  by  previous  Governor  Masaaki \nShirakawa  at  the  time,  introduced  its  2%  price  stability  target.  In  April  2013,  under \ncurrent  Governor  Haruhiko  Kuroda,  the  BOJ  adopted  massive  and  various  monetary \neasing  tools  to  achieve  the  target\u2014so-called  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Monetary \nEasing (QQE). This was expanded in October 2014, and supplemented with a negative \ninterest  rate  in  January  2016  and  yield  curve  control  in  September  2016.  The  BOJ\u2019s \nfinancial  assets  as  a  share  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  recorded  about  100% \ncurrently\u2014much greater than the European Central Bank (about 30%) and the Federal \nReserve (about 25% in 2014 when the maximum had been reached). While the BOJ\u2019s \nasset  purchasing  program  was  extended  from  the  Comprehensive  Monetary  Easing \n(CME)  under  then  Governor  Shirakawa,  its  scale  of  monetary  accommodation  and \ndiversity  of  monetary  easing  tools  adopted  are  unprecedented  and  extraordinary. \nMoreover,  raising  inflation  to  achieve  the  2%  target  in  a  low  inflationary  or  mild \ndeflationary  environment  like  Japan  is  a  rare  experiment  in  the  world.  Many  central \nbanks  have  adopted  the  inflation-targeting  framework,  but  in  the  context  of  a  high-\ninflation environment, so containing inflation was their key objective. \n\nIn  April  2013,  Governor  Kuroda  appeared  certain  that  the  2%  price  stability  target \nwould  be  achieved  in  around  2  years  since  all  necessary  measures  had  been  taken. \nMore than 5 years have since passed, and the BOJ continues to lag behind other major \ncentral  banks  including  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB). \nWhile the Fed struggled to achieve the 2% long-run goal, inflation based on personal \nconsumption expenditure (PCE) and core inflation (based on PCE excluding food and \nenergy) have finally been at a level of around 2% since March 2018. In the eurozone, \ninflation based on the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) has been around \n2%  since  April  2018,  but  core  inflation  has  remained  at  around  1%\u2014well  below  their \nprice  stability  target  of  \u201cbelow,  but  close  to,  2%.\u201d  The  BOJ  is  the  poorest  performer \namong  the  three  central  banks  since  both  headline  and  core  inflation  remained \nsubstantially  weaker.  According  to  the  latest  September  2018  data,  inflation  based  \non  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  recorded  1.2%  but  CPI  excluding  all  food  and \nenergy\u2014an  indicator  that  reflect  goods  and  services  mostly  determined  by  domestic \ndemand  and  supply  conditions\u2014was  a  mere  0.1%.  In  July  2018,  the  BOJ  gave  up \nexpressing  the  expected  timing  to  reach 2%  inflation\u2014after  having  postponed  it  \nsix times after its initial claim of \u201caround fiscal year 2015.\u201d This is a clear indication that \nthe BOJ has lost confidence in achieving the target in the foreseeable future.  \n\nThis paper takes an overview of the BOJ\u2019s monetary policy since April 2013 when QQE \nwas  adopted  and  examines  factors  contributing  to  the  failure  of  achieving  the  2%  \nprice stability target. The paper is comprised of five sections. Section II briefly focuses \non  QQE  adopted  in  April  2013  and  its  expansion  in  October  2014.  Section  III  \nsheds light on the negative interest rate, yield curve control, and the recent monetary \npolicy  adjustment  announced  in  July  2018\u2014all  of  which  could  be  views  as  \u201csteps \ntowards  monetary  policy  normalization\u201d\u2014not  yet  as  \u201cclear  steps  of  monetary  policy \nnormalization\u201d  but  steps  moving  closer  toward  normalization\u2014due  to  the  clear \ndeviation  from  the  original  QQE  framework.  These  measures  have  given  rise  to \nambiguity  and  complexity  over  the  monetary  policy  framework  due  to  inconsistency \nwith  the  BOJ\u2019s  communication  strategies.  Section  IV  reviews  inflation  performance  \nand  factors  contributing  to  the  failure  of  achieving  the  2%  price  stability  target.  \nSection V concludes.  \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\n2.  ADOPTION OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE \n\nMONETARY EASING AND ITS EXPANSION \n\n2.1  Features of QQE Adopted in April 2013 \n\nThe  BOJ  adopted  QQE  in  April 2013  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2%  at  \nthe  earliest  possible  time,  with  a  time  horizon  of  about  2  years.  The  \u201cquantitative\u201d \ndimension referred to the expansion of the monetary base at an annual pace of \\60\u2013\\70 \ntrillion\u2014monetary  base \ntargeting  (or  monetary  base  control).  The  \u201cqualitative\u201d \ndimension  referred  mainly  to  the  guideline  for  asset  purchases  comprising  of  (a)  net \nJGB  purchases  at  an  annual  pace  of  about  \\50  trillion  (excluding  the  amount  of \nreinvestment); (b) the average remaining maturity of JGB purchases of about 7 years \n(6 to 8 years) by purchasing JGBs all up to the maximum 40 years; and, (c) Exchange-\nTraded Fund (ETF) and Real Estate Investment Trust (J-REIT) purchases at an annual \npace of about \\1 trillion and about \\30 billion, respectively. To demonstrate its intention \nto achieve 2% inflation in about 2 years, the BOJ announced that it would double the \nmonetary base and the amounts outstanding of JGBs and ETFs in 2 years, and more \nthan double the average remaining maturity of JGB purchases. At the same time, the \nBOJ  adopted  forward  guidance  that  QQE  would  continue  aiming  to  achieve  the  \nprice  stability  target  of  2%,  as  long  as  it  is  necessary  for  maintaining  that  target  in  a \nstable manner.  \n\nMonetary base control is the most important element of QQE; it indicated a shift of the \nmain operating target for money market operations from the uncollateralized overnight \ncall  rate  to  the  monetary  base.  One  of  the  major  tasks  of  the  BOJ\u2019s  operational \ndepartment  (Financial  Markets  Department)  is  to  meet  the  operating  target  as  \nclosely as possible. This means that achieving the monetary base target is prioritized \nover  other  guidelines  in  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  This  operating  target  differs  \nfrom  that  of  the  Federal  Reserve  where  the  objective  for  open  market  operations \ncontinued to be specified as the federal funds rate (short-term policy rate). The Federal \nReserve  maintained  this  target  even  when  it  greatly  expanded  its  holdings  of  \nlonger-term  securities  through  open  market  purchases  with  the  goal  of  putting \ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates. This symbolizes the priority given to \n\u201cquantity\u201d  under  Mr.  Kuroda\u2019s  Governorship,  while  the  Federal  Reserve  treated  asset \npurchases as supplement to the federal funds rate. To achieve this scale of monetary \nbase expansion, JGBs were the most important financial assets purchased. The BOJ\u2019s \npurchases  of  longer-term  JGBs  would  result  in  a  decline  in  the  net  supply  of  these \nbonds  circulating  in  the  markets,  so  that  the  average  remaining  maturity  of  JGBs \ntransacted  in  the  markets  would  be  shortened.  This  would  lead  to  a  decline  in  the  \nterm premium.  \n\n2.2  Expansion of QQE Announced in October 2014 \n\nAbout  one  and  a  half  year  after  the  initiation  of  QQE,  the  BOJ  decided  to  expand  \nthe annual pace of increase in the monetary base from about \\60\u2013\\70 trillion to about  \n\\80  trillion  in  October  2013.  The  main  reason  was  a  sharp  decline  in  household \nspending  caused  by  a  consumption  tax  hike  in  April  2014.  A  decline  in  long-term \ninflation expectations caused by weaker domestic demand and an oil price drop from \nmid-2014  were  other  factors  leading  to  the  decision  to  expand  QQE.  To  achieve  this \nmonetary  base  targeting,  the  amount  outstanding  of  JGB  holdings  was  increased  by \n\\30 trillion to about \\80 trillion. With a view to encouraging a further decline in interest \nrates across the entire yield curve, moreover, the BOJ extended the average remaining \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\nmaturity target of JGB purchases from about 7 years (6\u20138 years) to about 7\u201310 years. \nIn addition  to  the  JGBs,  the  BOJ  decided  to  increase  purchases  of  risk  assets  such  \nas  ETFs  and  J-REITs,  tripling  their  amounts  outstanding  and  increasing  their  annual \npace of purchase from about \\1 trillion to about \\3 trillion and from about \\30 billion to \nabout \\90 billion, respectively. The average remaining maturity of JGB purchases was \nextended further from about 7\u201310 years to about 7\u201312 years in December 2015. \n\n3.  NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE, YIELD CURVE COTROL, \n\nAND THE JULY 2018 ADJUSTMENTS \n\n3.1  The Negative Interest Rate Policy \n\nIn January 2016, the BOJ surprised the public and the markets when it announced its \ndecision to adopt a negative interest rate on part of excess reserves, with effect from \n16 February, the possibility of which had been rejected by the BOJ for many years. The \nBOJ\u2019s new view was that a negative interest rate would expand aggregate demand and \ninflation expectations, thereby accelerating the path toward 2% inflation. The negative \ninterest  rate  policy  is  applicable  to  current  accounts  that  financial  institutions  hold  at  \nthe  BOJ.  Since  adopting  the  Complementary  Deposit  Facility  in  October  2008,  the  \nBOJ  had  initiated  payment  of  positive  interest  on  the  current  account  balances  and \nmaintained 0.1% until adoption of a negative interest rate. 1 Out of the current account \nbalances, no interest rate (zero interest rate) is applied to required reserve balances.  \n\n3.1.1  The Negative Interest Rate Policy and Three-Tier System \n\nThe negative interest rate policy gave rise to the complicated three-tier system where \nthe outstanding current account balance was decomposed into three types to which a \npositive  0.1%,  zero  percent,  and  \u20130.1%  is  applied,  respectively.  These  respective \nbalances  are  called  Basic  Balance,  Macro  Addon  Balance,  and  Policy-Rate  Balance, \nrespectively. The specific amount has since been transferred regularly from the Policy-\nRate  Balance  to  the  Macro  Addon  Balance  using  the  Benchmark  Ratio\u2014to  maintain \nthe  amount  outstanding  of  around  \\10  in  the  Policy-Rate  Balance  on  a  monthly  basis \n(see Shirai [2018a] for details). The rationale for adopting the three-tier system was to \nmitigate  adverse  impacts  of  a  negative  interest  rate  on  the  profitability  of  financial \ninstitutions through a decline in interest income paid by the BOJ on the current account \nbalance\u2014as  well  as  to  maintain  the  functioning  of  call  markets  through  promoting  \ninter-bank transactions. The system is more complicated than the ECB system, where \na  negative  interest  rate  (\u20130.4)  has  been  applied  to  all  excess  reserves  and  the  \ndeposit facility.  \n\nHereafter, the BOJ announced that monetary easing would be pursued by making full \nuse  of  possible  measures  in  terms  of  three  dimensions  by  adding  interest  rate  to \nexisting  quantitative  and  qualitative  dimensions\u2014so  called  \u201cQQE  with  a  Negative \nInterest Rate.\u201d On the quantitative dimension, the BOJ stressed again a willingness to \nexpand  the  monetary  base  since  it  could  technically  continue  to  purchase  the  JGBs \nfrom  the  markets  given  that  their  holdings  accounted  for  only  30%\u201340%  of  the \noutstanding amount issued. The BOJ also rephrased the forward guidance that it would \n\n                                                 \n1   The BOJ introduced the positive (0.1%) interest rate on the current account balance in 2008 as a floor \nto  the  interest  rate  corridors.  This  practice  is  adopted  by  major  central  banks  including  the  Federal \nReserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England as well. The floor could be established \nbecause no banks should be willing to lend at a rate below this rate.  \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\ncontinue with QQE with a Negative Interest Rate, aiming to achieve the price stability \ntarget of 2%, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. \n\n3.1.2  Benefits and Costs of the Negative Interest Rate Policy \n\nMainly, three developments were driven by the negative interest rate: (1) a temporary \nexpansion  of  residential  investment  and  J-REIT  market,  (2)  greater  issuance  of  \nlonger-term corporate bonds, and (3) greater foreign portfolio investment by Japanese \nfinancial institutions. On the other hand, the negative interest rate policy flattened  the \nentire  yield  curve  and  resulted  in  reducing  longer-term  yields  to  a  significant  degree. \nWhile  the  BOJ  emphasized  this  was  a  result  of  its  successful  monetary  policy,  the \nnegative interest rate policy raised a number of concerns and had side effects. These \nadverse impacts can be classified into four issues: (1) a decline in the profitability of the \nfinancial sector and potential financial instability risk; (2) promotion of cash substitution \nand a deterioration in households\u2019 sentiments; (3) a decline in liquidity and weakened \nfunctions  of  the  JGB  markets;  and  (4)  the  BOJ\u2019s  operational  challenges  and  balance \nsheet risk (for details, see Shirai 2018a). These effects appear to have exceeded the \naforementioned benefits. \n\nFirst,  the  negative  interest  rate  policy  squeezed  the  spreads  between  lending  and \ndeposit  interest  rates  further,  contributing  to  a  further  decline  in  banking  sector \nprofitability (Figure 1). Banks found it difficult to charge a negative deposit interest rate \nto  both  retail  and  large  depositors  for  fear  of  losing  customers  in  the  overcrowded \nbanking  sector.  This  adverse  impact  is  particularly  severe  in  Japan,  as  the  loan-to-\ndeposit  ratio  has  remained  below  70%  and  declined  further  because  deposit  growth \nhas  consistently  exceeded  credit  growth.  Banks  also  received  a  smaller  amount  of \ninterest income from JGB holdings due to lower coupon rates. For the time being, they \ncould enjoy unrealized valuation gains from JGB holdings or capital gains from selling \nthem. Nevertheless, they found it difficult to reinvest JGB redemptions in an extremely \nlow  interest  rate  environment.  Banks  raised  concerns  over  the  risk  of  undermining \nfinancial intermediation in case of current monetary policy continuing for a long time. As \nfor institutional investors, an excessive decline in yields on long-term and super-long-\nterm  JGBs  (with  remaining  maturity  of  over  10  years)  made  it  difficult  for  insurance \ncompanies  and  pension  funds  to  maintain  sufficient  returns  from  these  assets.  Lower \nyields  also  increased  future  pension  benefit  obligations  through  a  lower  applied \ndiscount  rate.  Although  the  negative  interest  rate  policy  had  not  yet  generated  a \nsubstantial  adverse  impact  as  a  whole  on  these  industries,  institutional  investors  had \nbegun  to  express  concerns  over  the  future  viability  of  their  business  models.  In  fact, \nmany  insurance  companies  stopped  providing  savings-type  insurance  plans  due  to \nlimited returns, while others raised premiums for new clients. \n\nSecond, household behavior and sentiment appear to have been adversely affected by \nthe negative interest rate policy. There was a rapid increase in notes in circulation until \naround September 2016 due to a certain degree of conversion from deposits into cash \nholdings  in  safety  boxes  at  home  or  banks.  The  growth  rate  on  notes  in  circulation \nexceeded  5%  until  September  2018  while  the  growth  rate  on  individual  deposits \ndropped  to  around  1.2%  in  2016  from  2.5%  in  2014\u20132015.  The  ratio  of  notes  in \ncirculation to GDP rose to about 20% in 2016 or one of the highest among advanced \neconomies.  There  is  a  clear  contrast  with  Sweden,  where  the  ratio  continues  to  drop \neven  after  adoption  of  a  negative  interest  rate  (\u20130.5%).  Japan  remains  a  relatively \ncash-based  society  compared  with  Sweden,  an  economy  that  is  highly  digitized  and \nwhere cash is hardly used, so that a negative interest rate had a greater impact on the \nsubstitution of cash for deposits in Japan than in Sweden. An increase in cash holdings \nreflects households\u2019 renewed recognition of a very low retail deposit rate. According to \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS.

Given  that \nhouseholds\u2019  deposits  and  cash  are  about  three  times  as  large  as  their  loans, \nhouseholds appear to have experienced an adverse effect in terms of the net impact of \nthe negative interest rate. \n\nlow\u201d\u2014dropped  significantly \n\nthose  with  \u201ctoo \n\nFigure 1: Difference between New Lending Rate and Deposit Rate  \n(%)  \n\nSource: Bank of Japan. \n\n \n\nThird,  massive  purchases  of  JGBs  under  QQE  have  deteriorated  the  liquidity  and \nfunctioning  of  the  JGB  markets.  The  negative  interest  rate  policy  exacerbated  these \nconditions further as a greater number of traditional market participants refrained from \nactively  transacting  in  the  market  to  avoid  the  negative  interest  rate.  The  scarcity  of \nJGBs  also  led  to  a  shrinkage  of  related  monetary  market  activities.  The  BOJ  has \nconducted a quarterly Bond Market Survey against about 40 eligible institutions on the \nBOJ\u2019s  outright  purchases  and  sales  of  JGBs  since  February  2015  (Figure  2).  The \nsurvey  reports  the  diffusion  index  (DI)  for  the  degree  of  bond  market  functioning  with \nregard  to  current  conditions  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  company  with  which  the \nrespondent  is  affiliated.  The  degree  of  bond  market  functioning  DI  deteriorated \nsignificantly  from  the  February  2016  survey  to  the  August  2016  survey.  From  the \nAugust 2015 survey to the August 2016 survey, the DI for the current situation dropped \nfrom  \u20135  (percentage  points)  to  \u201346.  The  development  suggested  that  the  negative \ninterest  rate  policy  announced  on  29 January  2016  and  the  subsequent  drop  in  JGB \nyields  reduced  liquidity  in  the  JGB  market.  Since  then,  the  DI  on  bond  market \nfunctioning has not recovered much.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS.

It is important to recognize that applying a positive rate \non the current account balance had contributed to sustaining smooth operations of the \nasset  purchasing  program.  The  banking  sector  is  dominant  in  the  financial  sector  in \nJapan with ample deposits from retail customers so that the market sizes of securities \nmarkets  (such  as  corporate  bonds  and  asset-backed  securities)  are  small.  Thus,  the \nJGBs  are  the  main  financial  assets  purchased  by  the  BOJ  from  banks  to  steadily \nexpand  the  monetary  base  while  such  banks  need  to  hold  the  JGBs  mainly  to  fill  the \ngap  between  retail  deposits  and  loans  extended  to  the  private  sector.  Large  banks \nmight be more willing to sell JGBs to the BOJ to avoid potential interest rate risk; and, \nthey could do so due to the ability to earn revenue from actively investing abroad. By \ncontrast,  the  majority  of  regional  banks  have  only  limited  alternative  investment \nopportunities due to limited skills so that they have to examine whether their holdings of \nJGBs should be sold to the BOJ and earn an interest rate on excess reserves for newly \nincreasing  current  accounts  held  with  the  BOJ,  or,  alternatively,  should  be  held  until \nmaturity to earn a positive coupon rate. The positive rate of 0.1% on excess reserves, \nthus,  had  provided  the  incentive  for  these  banks  to  sell  the  JGBs  to  the  BOJ  so  that  \nthe  expansion  of  the  monetary  base  and  an  associated  increase  in  asset  purchases \nused  to  be  consistent  with  the  positive  0.1%  interest  rate.  This  situation  is  different  \nfrom  European  countries  with  a  negative  interest  rate  (such  as  the  European  Central \nBank and Swedish Riksbank), where these central banks could purchase bonds from \nforeign investors.  \n\nTherefore, the adoption of a negative interest rate reduced the sustainability of the JGB \npurchase, since banks became reluctant to sell the JGBs. It is appropriate to state that \nthe  negative  interest  rate  policy  fundamentally  changed  the  QQE  framework  both \nconceptually and operationally. \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\n3.1.3  Unique Market Reactions  \n\nMoreover,  the  negative  interest  rate  generated  unique  market  reactions.  The  January \n2016 announcement had been initially received by the markets with a positive surprise, \nbut  this  lasted  for  only  2  working  days.  If  the  market  reaction  to  this  surprise  had  led  \nto  the  yen\u2019s  depreciation  and  the  resultant  higher  Japanese  stock  prices  after  the \nannouncement,  it  suggests  that  market  participants  viewed  the  policy  change  as \nadditional  monetary  stimulus  and  thus  positively.  Indeed,  the  yen  had  depreciated \nagainst  the  US  dollar  from  around  \\118.7  to  around  \\121  and  the  Nikkei  225  Stock \nAverage  had  risen  from  around  \\17,164  to  around  \\17,518.  Thereafter,  however,  the \nexchange  rate  of  the  yen  against  the  US  dollar  rapidly  appreciated  from  around  \\119  \nin  early  February  to  below  \\110  by  in  April  and  further  to  below  \\105  in  mid-June.  It \nappreciated  to  \\99.08  temporarily  on  24  June  in  response  to  the  surprise  Brexit \nreferendum  result  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Thereafter,  the  yen  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  US  dollar \nfluctuated in the range of \\100\u2013\\106. Similarly, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped \nbelow \\17,000 from early February, and since then the stock prices have moved mostly \nin  the  range  of  \\16,000  to  \\17,000.  The  positive  market  mood  evaporated  rapidly \nbecause  the  BOJ  did  not  increase  JGB  purchases  despite  its  repeated  emphasis  \non  possible  additional  easing  in  the  quantitative  dimension.  Also,  market  participants \nappeared  to  have  begun  to  recognize  the  negative  interest  rate  would  harm  the \nbanking  sector  through  a  cut  in  interest  rate  margins.  Growing  concern  over  the \nprofitability  of  Deutsche Bank,  the  largest  bank  in  Germany,  as  a  result  of  litigation \ncharges, in those days added to this view, leading to a large sell-off of banking sector \nstocks  in  Japan.  Some  foreign  investors  took  the  view  that  a  negative  interest  rate \npolicy was timid since only a small portion of the current account balance was subject \nto a negative interest rate so that the effectiveness of a negative interest rate could be \nweaker than that of the ECB where a negative rate was applied to all excess reserves \nand deposit facility. \n\n3.2  The Yield Curve Control Policy \n\n3.2.1  Background Prior to the Adoption of Yield Curve Control \n\nThe BOJ\u2019s communication strategy since January 2016 had repeatedly emphasised its \nintention  to  expand  monetary  easing  in  three  dimensions  (quantity,  quality,  and  a \nnegative  interest  rate)  if  necessary.  Accordingly,  many  market  participants  formed \nexpectations over additional monetary easing in three dimensions prior to the July 2016 \nmonetary  policy  meeting.  Contrary  to  their  expectations,  however,  the  BOJ  expanded \nmonetary  easing  in  July  2016  only  by  increasing  ETF  purchases  to  about  \u00a56  trillion. \nThis limited action could have disappointed the markets, but the BOJ skilfully avoided \nthis  by  suggesting  its  plan  to  consider  new  but  different  actions  that  would  help  to \nachieve  the  2%  stability  target  at  the  earliest  at  its  next  [September]  monetary  policy \nmeeting.  Together  with  the  BOJ\u2019s  simultaneous  decision  to  increase  support  for \nfinancial institutions to ensure smooth funding in US dollars, this suggestion contributed \nto  market  anticipation  that  the  BOJ  would  revise  its  framework  by  avoiding  a  further \ndecline  in  yields  and  by  reducing  the  burden  borne  by  financial  institutions.  From  \nearly  September  2016,  moreover,  Governor  Kuroda  admitted  openly  the  adverse \nimpacts  of  its  negative  interest  rate  policy.  In  his  speech  delivered  at  Kisaragikai \nMeeting on 5 September 2016, he mentioned that the adverse impact of the negative \ninterest  rate  policy  on  the  profits  of  commercial  banks,  insurance  firms,  and  pension \nfunds  could  affect  people's  confidence  by  causing  concerns  over  the  sustainability  of \nthe  financial  function  in  a  broad  sense,  thereby  negatively  affecting  economic  activity \n(Kuroda 2016b). \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\n3.2.2  Clear Departure from the QQE Framework \n\nrate  on \n\nthe  current  account  balance\u2014was \n\nYield  curve  control\u2014fixing  a  10-year  target  at  around  0%  with  an  existing  negative \ninconsistent  with  BOJ\u2019s \ninterest \ncommunication  strategy  due  to  the  failure  to  fulfil  the  commitment  to  expanding \nmonetary  easing  in  the  three  dimensions.  Prior  to  this,  Governor  Kuroda,  at  the  July \n2016 press conference, had emphasized that the quantity (dimension) had not reached \nthe limit at all and that this would not be taken lightly.  Nonetheless, not only the BOJ \ndid  not  increase  the  quantity  as  committed,  but  also  the  BOJ  abandoned  monetary \nbase  targeting.  The  idea  of  yield  curve  control  seems  to  have  been  based  on  the \nexperience  of  the  Federal  Reserve  in  1942\u20131951,  which  was  aimed  at  reducing \ngovernment financing cost by pegging short-term Treasury bills at 0.375% and capping \nthe yields on all other Treasury securities at 2.5%. Another action adopted by the BOJ \nin  September  2016  was  an  official  abandonment  of  guidelines  on  average  remaining \nmaturity  of  JGB  purchases\u2014one  of  the  major  pillars  included  in  the  qualitative \ndimension.  This  maturity  guideline  was  introduced  to  prioritise  exerting  downward \npressure  on  longer-term  JGBs.  Abandonment  of  the  guidelines  naturally  resulted  in \nfewer long-term JGB purchases. \n\nTherefore,  the  BOJ  clearly  departed  from  the  QQE  framework  by  abandoning  two \nessential  pillars  characterising  QQE\u2014the  monetary  base  control  and  the  target  on \naverage  remaining  maturity  of  JGB  purchases.  It  is  not  appropriate  for  the  BOJ  to \ncontinue to use \u201cQQE\u201d to describe its monetary easing framework since its adoption of \nyield curve control essentially abandoned \u201cquantitative\u201d dimension.  \n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  new  monetary  framework  under  yield  curve  control  introduced \nthe inflation-overshooting commitment \u2013 continuing the monetary base until the rate of \nincrease  in  core  CPI  (CPI  excluding  fresh  foods)  exceeds  the  2%  target  and  stays \nabove  the  target  in  a  stable  manner.  The  inflation-overshooting  commitment  appears  \nto  have  been  inserted  to  appeal  to  market  participants  that  quantity  would  not  been \ngiven  up  completely  and  remind  them  of  the  BOJ\u2019s  firm  determination  to  achieve  the \n2%  target.  However,  this  expression  is  technically  and  conceptually  redundant,  since \nactual  inflation  needs  to  exceed  2%  for  many  months  to  achieve  2%  inflation  in  a  \nstable  manner  (described  in  BOJ\u2019s  forward  guidance)  since  that  requires  to  anchor \nlong-term  inflation  expectations  at  around  2%.  Given  that  such  inflation  expectations \nhave  been  heavily  influenced  by  past  actual  inflation\u2014often  called  \u2018adoptive  inflation \nexpectations\u2019\u2014in  Japan,  actual  inflation  must  exceed  2%  and  remain  above  2%  for \nmany  months  to  pull  up  inflation  expectations  toward  2%  (Hattori  and  Yetman  2017, \nKamada et al. 2015). The markets largely perceived the newly introduced overshooting \ncommitment as not credible, due to the low probability of achieving 2% inflation stably. \nRather,  the  markets  took  the  commitment  as  an  assurance  for  continuing  asset \npurchases  for  a  very  long  time  so  that  they  can  benefit  from  such  an  assurance  by \ntaking a short position in yen and a long position in US dollar due to assured interest \nrate differentials.  \n\nIf  the  BOJ  is  truly  committed  to  yield  curve  control,  the  amount  of  JGBs  to  be \npurchased should be endogenously determined by the supply and demand conditions \nin the JGB market. In other words, the BOJ should be ready to reduce the annual pace \nof  JGB  purchases  from  \u00a580  trillion  during  a  phase  of  strong  downward  pressures  on \nlonger-term  yields.  Nonetheless,  the  Statement  on  Monetary  Policy  maintained  the \nremark  about  the  projected  continuation  of  JGB  purchases  of  about  \u00a580  trillion\u2014in \ncontradiction  with  the  concept  of  yield  curve  control.  Maintaining  the  remark  about  \n\u00a580  trillion  presumably  reflects  the  BOJ\u2019s  concern  about  negative  market  reactions, \nshould the new framework be viewed as a clear step towards tapering or a cut in the \namount of JGB purchases.  \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\n3.2.3  Motivations for Adopting Yield Curve Control \n\nRaising  the  10-year  yield  and  steepening  the  yield  curve  achieved  under  yield  curve \ncontrol  are  a  de  facto  tightening  of  monetary  easing.  In  my  view,  yield  curve  control \nwas  adopted  for  three  reasons.  First,  it  was  in  response  to growing  criticism  that  had \nemerged since the adoption of the negative interest rate and thus to mitigate adverse \nimpacts on financial institutions as pointed out earlier. Together with the ongoing JGB \npurchases of about \u00a580 trillion, the negative interest rate policy had reduced the JGB \nyields into negative territory for the remaining maturity up to 10 years and flattened the \nyield  curve  excessively.  Second,  purchasing  the  JGBs  at  the  annual  pace  of  about  \n\u00a580  trillion  was  becoming  increasingly  difficult  due  to  scarcity  in  the  JGB  market \ncaused by the BOJ\u2019s massive purchases. This reflects that the BOJ needs to purchase \nJGBs  from  JGB  holders,  such  as  regional  banks  and  institutional  investors  that  need \nthem  either  to  fill  the  gap  between  loans  and  deposits  or  for  their  asset-liability \nmanagement.  Similar  to  2016,  the  BOJ  needed  to  purchase  about  \u00a5120  trillion  on  a \ngross  basis  (\u00a580  trillion  plus  about  \u00a540  trillion  for  reinvesting  redemption)  of  JGBs \nexpected  in  2017.  Third,  purchasing  fewer  longer-term  bonds  and  more  shorter-term \nbonds has distorted the yield curve since the 2-year and 5-year yields remain low and \nin  negative  territory.  They  are  much  lower  than  the  negative  rate  of  \u20130.1%\u2014far  from \nthe  desirable  yield  curve  that  the  BOJ  claims  to  achieve  with  yield  curve  control. \nTherefore, it seems to be just a matter of time before the BOJ will begin tapering from \nabout \u00a580 trillion.  \n\nTable  1  shows  that  the  BOJ  purchased  JGBs  of  about  \u00a5230  trillion  from  fiscal  year \n2013  to  fiscal  year  2016.  This  purchase  was  possible  mainly  because  of  a  large \nincrease  in  net  JGB  issuance  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (about  \u00a5127  trillion)  and  the \nsale  by  depository  financial  institutions  led  by  large  banks  (about  \u00a596  trillion).  Major \ninvestors in the JGB market are depository financial institutions led by regional banks \n(with total holdings amounting to about \u00a5190 trillion) and insurance firms (\u00a5203 trillion), \nboth of which need the JGBs to fill out the gaps between loans and deposits as well as \nmatch the maturities of assets and liabilities, respectively. Since they are unlikely to sell \nJGBs  significantly  to  the  BOJ,  a  further  continuation  of  the  JGB  purchases  of  \u00a580 \ntrillion had become challenging.  \n\nIndeed,  the  BOJ  reduced  the  JGB  purchases  steadily  from  September  2016  to  the \npresent despite its remark on the continuation of about \u00a580 trillion in the Statement on \nMonetary Policy. Without having reduced net purchases of JGBs from \u00a580 trillion, the \nyields would have declined further given strong demand for the JGBs from banks and \nlife insurers. When the yield curve control was announced, I immediately took the view \nand  claimed  on  various  occasions  that  the  BOJ\u2019s  intention  was  to  abandon  the \nquantity-based operation target without publicly admitting it. Therefore, I have called it \n\u201cimplicit tapering\u201d or an intention on the part of the BOJ to reduce the annual pace of \nJGB  purchases  without  admitting  its  true  intention.  My  view  was  soon  found  to  be \ncorrect since the BOJ began to actively reduce the annual pace of JGB purchases in \nSeptember  2016  (media  later  called  it  \u201cstealth  tapering\u201d).  Figure  3  indicates  that  an \nincrease  in  the  size  of  the  monetary  base  and  the  amount  outstanding  of  JGBs \ncompared to the same month in the previous year. The amount dropped from around \n\\80 trillion before the announcement of the yield curve control to well below \\80 trillion \nfrom  September  2016.  The  amount  of  the  annual  pace  of  increase  subsequently \ndropped  steadily  and  has  been  below  \\50  trillion  since  March  2018.  In  the  press \nconference following the June 2017 monetary policy meeting, Governor Kuroda finally \nadmitted that the annual pace of net JGB purchases is endogenously determined since \nthe  10-year  yield  is  an  official  guideline  for  market  operations,  suggesting  a  decline \nfrom around \u00a580 trillion is reasonable. \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS.

Only after the unexpected result of the US presidential election on 8 November, \n2016,  did  global  investors  suddenly  increase  their  risk  appetite  in  anticipation  of  \nhigher  economic  growth  and  inflation  in  the  US  driven  by  tax  cuts,  deregulation,  and \ninfrastructure investment. This led to a rapid rise in long-term yields, stock prices, and \nan appreciation of the US dollar against almost all major currencies in the US. Driven \nby global investors\u2019 enthusiasm, the BOJ\u2019s yield curve control suddenly looked effective \nas  market  participants  began  to  pay  greater  attention  to  a  widening  of  interest  rate \ndifferentials  with  the  US\u2014rather  than  the  relative  size  of  monetary  base  between  the \nUS  and  Japan.  It  should  be  noted  that  noncommercial  investors  in  the  International \nMoney  Market  (IMM)  of  the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange  shifted  the  yen\u2019s  net \npositions  from  long  positions  seen  in  late  2015  to  short  positions  in  December  2016. \nSince this market has been dominated by short-term-oriented investors such as hedge \nfunds,  it  means  that  their  speculation  shifted  from  the  yen\u2019s  appreciation  to  its \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\ndepreciation. The yen vis-\u00e0-vis US dollar depreciated to around \\117 by end-December \n2016, thereby contributing to higher stock prices in Japan. \n\n3.3  Monetary Policy Adjustments Announced in July 2018  \n\nThe  BOJ  made  a  series  of  moderate  adjustments  to  the  monetary  easing  policy \nframework in July 2018. While they clearly pointed to a more hawkish stance, the BOJ \neven  referred  to  these  adjustments  as  \u201cStrengthening  the  Framework  for  Continuous \nPowerful  Monetary  Easing  Framework.\u201d  The  justification  was  an  adoption  of  the \nforward guidance with regards to two policy rates (10-year yield and a negative interest \nrate).  The  10-year  bond  yield  has  since  exceeded  over  0.1%  most  of  the  time.  The \nBOJ\u2019s  action  successfully  avoided  a  sharp  appreciation  of  the  yen  and  a  sharp  stock \nprice  fall\u2014suggesting  that  the  market  did  not  view  these  adjustments  as  a  more \nhawkish  stance.  While  the  BOJ  asserted  that  there  were  no  fundamental  changes  to \nthe  framework,  it  skillfully  introduced  a  few  elements  that  could  lead  to  steps  toward \nnormalization of the monetary policy. These adjustment were made at the expense of \nthe greater ambiguity and complexity of the monetary policy framework since the BOJ\u2019s \nactions have increasingly deviated from their communication strategies. The relatively \nhawkish stance could be traced from the following four aspects. \n\n3.3.1  The Intention to Introduce and Expand the Yield Target Range \n\nFirst, the BOJ introduced the upper and lower range (\u00b10.2%) of the 10-year target from \nthe  previous  target  range  of  \u00b10.1%  (-0.1%  to  +0.1%).  The  new  target  range  was \nmentioned  by  Governor  Kuroda  at  the  press  conference  for  the  first  time  as  the \nprevious target range of \u00b10.1% was inferred by market participants on the basis of the \nlevels  of  fixed  rates  chosen  by  the  BOJ  in  conducting  unlimited  bond  purchase \noperations. In practice, the new range means 0% and 0.2% because negative 10-year \nyields are highly unlikely due to the scarcity of JGBs as a result of the BOJ\u2019s massive \nholdings (currently, about 50% of the JGBs outstanding issued). This is in line with my \nlong-standing view that the BOJ should adopt the 0-0.25% target range. This is clearly \na step toward normalization.  \n\nHow  did  the  BOJ  manage  to  control  market  reactions?  The  BOJ  did  not  mention \nanything  about  the  adoption  of  a  target  range  and  the  doubling  of  the  range  in  the \nStatement on Monetary Policy. Instead, Governor Kuroda indicated it in a light manner \nat  the  press  conference.  This  gave  the  impression  that  the  BOJ  did  not  change  the  \n10-year yield  at all as the Statement continued to specify the target of around 0%. In \naddition, the BOJ introduced the forward guidance on policy rates (a 10-year yield and \na  negative  short-term  rate)  about  the  continuation  of  the  current  extremely  low  levels \nfor an extended period by taking into account the effects of the consumption tax hike \nscheduled for October 2019. This guidance referred to October 2019 and thus invited \nsome market participants to view that the current long-term yields would be maintained \nat least until that date. However, it is a vague expression because the guidance does \nnot state clearly the continuation of low rates at least until October 2019. Moreover, the \nforward guidance did not specify the levels of the 10-year yield to be maintained during \nthis period contrary to the practices adopted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB. At \nthe  press  conference,  Governor  Kuroda  did  not  make  these  two  points  clearer  either \nwhen  asked  by  the  press.  This  means  that  it  is  possible  the  BOJ  might  raise  the  \n10-year yield target range above \u00b10.2% in the foreseeable future. \n\nSecond,  Governor  Kuroda  stressed  that  the  de  facto  introduction  of  the  yield  target \nlevel  was  to  improve  the  functioning  of  the  JGB  market  (i.e.,  lack  of  trading)\u2014not  to \nreduce side effects on financial institutions. But in reality the adoption of the range has \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\nhelped  to  raise  yields  of  longer-term  bonds,  which  would  be  favorable  for  holders  of \nlong-term  bonds  such  as  insurance  firms  and  regional  banks.  It  also  led  to  a  slightly \nhigher  new  lending  rate  for  banks.  Moreover,  the  Statement  on  Monetary  Policy \nspecified that the amount of current account balances to which a negative interest rate \nis  applied  would  be  reduced  from  the  current  \\10  trillion  on  average;  this  is  a  clear \nindication  that  the  BOJ  is  concerned  about  the  adverse  impact  of  a  negative  interest \nrate  on  banks.  The  reason  why  the  BOJ  did  not  want  to  admit  side  effects  of  the \nmonetary easing framework on financial institutions explicitly could be to avoid further \nconstant calls to raise policy rates soon. \n\n3.3.2  Adjustments of the ETF Purchases May Lead to Tapering \n\nThird,  the  BOJ  decided  to  purchase  ETFs  more  flexibly  by  buying  more  when  sharp \nfalls  occur  and  less  when  mild  falls  occur.  While  the  BOJ  stressed  that  the  annual \npurchase amount of about \\6 trillion is maintained, this would enable the BOJ to reduce \nthe annual purchase amount quietly\u2014so -called \u201cstealth tapering\u201d (or implicit tapering) \nas  is  the  case  with  the  JGBs.  This  is  also  consistent  with  my  long-standing  proposal \nthat  the  BOJ  should  begin  to  reduce  the  annual  amount  of  ETF  purchases  by \npurchasing  only  when  absolutely  necessary  (such  as  at  times  of  strong  downward \npressure on stock prices). This would enhance the BOJ\u2019s ability to promptly purchase \nmore ETFs in a recessionary phase.  \n\nFourth, the composition of ETF purchase was adjusted\u2014a move expected fully by the \nmarkets.  This  was  a  necessary  move  because  the  continuation  of  price-based  Nikkei \n225-related  ETFs  has  distorted  stock  prices  more  heavily  than  market  capitalization-\nbased TOPIX-related ETFs. Only 225 listed enterprises are included in the Nikkei 225 \nwhereas 2,095 enterprises are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Tier 1 Section. The \nstock  prices  of  a  number  of  small-cap  firms  included  in  Nikkei  225  firms  might  be  \nover-priced since the BOJ has already become one of the top investors in these firms \nwith  fewer  floating  stocks  available  in  the  market.  Before  the  July  2018  decision,  the \nTOPIX-related ETFs, the Nikkei 225-related ETFs, and JPX Nikkei Index 400 based on \nthe  purchased  price  (market  price)  had  accounted  for  about  57%  (54%),  37%  (41%), \nand 6% (5%), respectively. For new purchases, the BOJ expands TOPIX-related ETF \npurchases to over 80% and instead reduces Nikkei 225-related ETFs to over 10%. This \nwould enable the BOJ to continue the ETF purchases for longer.  \n\nTherefore,  the  intention  of  the  BOJ\u2019s  adjustments  is  not  only  to  improve  the \nsustainability of the framework as it has stressed, but also to take further steps toward \nnormalization of monetary policy.  \n\n4.  EFFECTIVENESS OF UNCONVENTIONAL \n\nMONETARY EASING \n\n4.1  Inflation Performance and the BOJ\u2019s Optimistic  \n\nInflation Forecast \n\nNotwithstanding  the  massive  scale  of  monetary  easing  and  diversity  of  monetary \neasing  tools  adopted,  the  BOJ  failed  to  achieve  the  2%  price  stability  target  over  the \npast  5  years  after  QQE.  The  average  rate  of  headline  inflation  during  fiscal  years \n2013\u20132017  since  the  adoption  of  QQE  recorded  a  mere  0.5%  (Table  2).  The  BOJ\u2019s \ncore inflation (based on CPI excluding fresh foods) recorded a slightly lower 0.4% on \naverage. The BOJ traditionally uses \u201ccore inflation\u201d to make inflation projections since \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\nfresh food prices are affected mostly by weather conditions and thus are very volatile. \nHowever,  inflation  based  on  CPI  excluding  all  food  and  energy\u2014similar  to  the  core \ninflation  indicator  adopted  by  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  ECB\u2014could  be  a  more \nsuitable indicator for measuring underlying inflation since most of food and energy are \nimported and their prices are determined in the international markets. Table 2 reports \nthat  the  average  rate  of  inflation  was  a  mere  0.3%\u2014much  lower  than  the  rates  of \nheadline inflation and the BOJ\u2019s core inflation. This indicates that inflation occurred due \nto a rise in the prices of fresh foods caused by bad weather as well as imported foods \nand energy affected by the depreciation of the yen and higher oil prices.  \n\nTable 2: The Rate of Change in CPI (Excluding the Direct Impact  \nof the Consumption Tax Hike)  \n\nFiscal Year \n\n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \nAverage \n\nCPI \n0.9  \n0.8  \n0.2  \n\u20130.1  \n0.7  \n0.5 \n\nCPI Excluding Fresh Food \n0.8  \n0.8  \n0.0  \n\u20130.2  \n0.7  \n0.4 \n\nCPI Excluding Food and Energy \n0.2 \n0.5 \n0.7 \n0.2 \n0.0 \n0.3 \n\nCPI = Consumer Price Index. \n\nSource: Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. \n\nDue to the failure to achieve higher inflation, the BOJ\u2019s inflation projections have been \npersistently  overly  optimistic  so  that  significant  downward  adjustments  have  always \nbecome inevitable later. The BOJ provides medium-term projections in April, July, and \nOctober,  and  January  of  every  fiscal  year  of  real  GDP  growth  and  the  rate  of  CPI \nexcluding fresh foods for next three fiscal years. Figure 4 indicates the medium of the \nboard members\u2019 projections and clearly shows this pattern. As the BOJ initially started \nwith  very  high  inflation  projections  for  a  specific  fiscal  year,  it  was  forced  to  make \ndownward  adjustments  almost  steadily  over  time  as  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year \napproached with the release of actual data. This pattern is visible for fiscal years 2014, \n2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.  \n\nMoreover,  the  BOJ  started  QQE  in  April  2013  by  specifying  the  expected  date  to \nachieve  around  2%  inflation  in  the  report  titled  \u201cOutlook  For  Economic  Activity  and \nPrices\u201d (Outlook Report). This practice was given up in the April 2017 Outlook Report. \nIn April 2013, the BOJ had initially claimed that around 2% would be likely toward the \nlatter  half  of  the  projection  period  (namely,  from  October  2014  to  March  2016  or \n\u201caround  fiscal  year  2015\u201d).  Thereafter,  having  moved  back  the  target  six  times,  the \nBOJ\u2019s  last  claim  just  before  its  abandonment  was  that  it  would  be  reached  \u201caround \nfiscal  year  2019.\u201d  Abandoning  its  price  stability  target  is  indicative  of  a  lack  of \nconfidence on the part of the BOJ in achieving it. The reaction by the market and media \nwas  limited,  however,  since  they  have  become  accustomed  to  the  BOJ\u2019s  constant \ndownward  adjustment  of  its  inflation  outlook  so  that  the  BOJ\u2019s  outlook  is  no  longer \nbeing taken seriously.  \n\nAccording  to  the  latest  October  2018  inflation  forecast,  the  medium  of  the  board \nmembers\u2019 projections for fiscal year 2018 was adjusted downward from 1.1% to 0.9%, \nthereby  becoming  similar  to  the  average  of  forecasters\u2019  projections  (about  0.9% \naccording to the latest Forecast Survey conducted by the Japan Center for Economic \nResearch against about 40 forecasters affiliated with financial institutions). The medium \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\nof the board members\u2019 projections for fiscal year 2019 (excluding the direct impact of \nthe  consumption  tax  hike  scheduled  in  October  2019)  was  adjusted  downward  from \n1.5%  to  1.4%,  but  remained  well  above  the  average  projection  of  forecasters  (about \n0.9%). The medium of the board members\u2019 projections for fiscal year 2020 (excluding \nthe direct impact of the scheduled consumption tax hike) was adjusted downward from \n1.6% to 1.5%. While the Forecast Survey does not report the projection for fiscal year \n2020, it provides long-term forecast biannually in June and December. According to the \nlatest 2018 Forecast Survey, the average projection of forecasters (excluding the direct \nimpact  of  the  consumption  tax  hike)  recorded  only  1%  in  2020\u20132024  and  1.2%  in \n2025\u20132029  suggesting that the  BOJ\u2019s projections have not  been found to be credible \nby professional forecasters.  \n\nFigure 4: Bank of Japan\u2019s Inflation Projection  \n(Medium of the Board Members\u2019 Projection) \n\nSource: Bank of Japan. \n\n \n\nAt  the  BOJ\u2019s  April  2018  press  conference,  Governor  Kuroda  admitted  that  general \nprices had not seen a steady pickup and said that the BOJ would intensify discussions \non the sluggish inflation at the next [July 2018] monetary policy meeting. However, he \nstressed that conducting another round of comprehensive assessment of the monetary \npolicy  following  the  September  2016  exercise  would  be  unnecessary  (BOJ  2018).  \nThe  2016  exercise  was  conducted  at  the  time  when  yield  curve  control  was  adopted \nwith  an  inflation-overshooting  commitment.  Mr.  Kuroda\u2019s  denial  of  another  round  of \ncomprehensive assessment was viewed by the market as a lack of willingness on the \npart  of  the  BOJ  to  conduct  additional  monetary  easing,  as  such  an  assessment \nrequires  the  BOJ  to  explain  why  the  2%  target  was  not  achieved  and  what  additional \nmeasures will be introduced.  \n\nWhile the BOJ has gradually adjusted their overly optimistic projections over time, more \nrealistic  projections  will  be  necessary  to  allow  the  central  bank  to  restore  credibility  \nover  their  projections  and  conduct  a  more  accountable  monetary  policy.  Only  proper \nprojections  for  inflation  would  enable  a  better  estimation  of  the  duration  of  monetary \naccommodation and the actions the BOJ should undertake over that period. \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\n4.2  Sluggish Inflation Performance and Weak  \n\nHouseholds\u2019 Spending \n\nJapan\u2019s sluggish inflation performance reflects that households\u2019 spending has not been \nas  strong  as  expected  by  the  BOJ.  Figure  5  indicates  the  real  GDP  level  (setting  the \nreal  GDP  level  for  fiscal  year  2006  equal  to  100)  and  shows  the  performance  from \nfiscal  year  2006  to  2017.  Over  the  past  11  fiscal  years,  real  GDP  levels  remained \nnearly flat, rising cumulatively by only 8.8%\u2014reflecting stagnant real consumption and \ndeclining  real  residential  investment.  Real  export  rose  rapidly  by  a  cumulative  29% \nover  the  period  of  fiscal  year  2006\u20132017,  but  real  import  also  rose  significantly,  by \n24%,  over  the  same  period,  so  that  net  real  exports  hardly  contributed  to  real  GDP \ngrowth.  The  main  contribution  to  real  GDP  growth,  therefore,  was  from  private \nnonresidential investment by firms in the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors. \nThe  level  of  private  nonresidential  investment  began  to  rise  gradually  in  2009  after  a \nsharp drop in the midst of the global financial crisis; but it has only just recovered to the \n2006  level.  A  recent  increase  in  nonresidential  investment  reflects  replacement \ndemand,  a  need  to  adopt  environmentally  friendly  and  labor-saving  equipment  and \nstructure,  as  well  as  construction  and  renovation  of  hotels,  shopping  malls,  and \nrestaurants  related  to  the  2020  Tokyo  Olympic  Games  and  growing  tourism.  It  is \nuncertain as to whether firms\u2019 business investment will continue to rise steadily in the \nfuture, given Japan\u2019s declining population and expected shrinking markets.  \n\nFigure 5: Level of Real GDP and Its Decomposition (Fiscal Year 2006-100) \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Cabinet Office. \n\n \n\n4.3  Weak Wage Performance and Wage Expectation  \n\nHouseholds\u2019  sluggish  spending  appears  to  have  been  associated  with  a  number  of \nfactors\u2014including  sluggish  wage  performance,  low  expectations  on  wage  outlook, \nconcerns  about  the  post-retirement  life,  and  upward  bias  in  price  perception  and \ninflation  expectations.  First,  actual  wage  performance  (total  cash  earnings)  has \nimproved  over  the  past  4  years  since  2014,  but  the  scale  of  wage  improvement  has \nbeen  too  moderate  to  exceed  the  2000  level.  According  to the  Monthly  Labor  Survey \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\ncompiled  by  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Health  and  Welfare,  the  year-on-year  change  in  \ntotal  cash  earnings  per  employee  rose  from  \u20130.4%  in  2013  to  0.4%  in  2014  and \nthereafter registered an unimpressive 0.1% in 2015, 0.5% in 2016, and 0.4% in 2017. \nWages have risen more rapidly in 2018, with the average year-on-year change in total \ncash  earnings  for  the  first  9  months  recording  1.5%\u2014thanks  to  the  government\u2019s  call \nfor  a  3%  nominal  wage  growth,  favorable  corporate  profits,  and  a  labor  shortage. \nNonetheless, the average growth rate of scheduled cash earnings (basic pay) over the \nsame month recorded a lower 1.1%. The more rapid growth in total cash earnings than \nscheduled  cash  earnings  indicates  that  the  recent  wage  increase  has  been  driven \nmainly by volatile bonus payments\u2014biannual payments generally linked to firms\u2019 profit \nperformance. Moreover, the level of total cash earnings remained below the 2000 level \n(Figure 6). More importantly, real wages remained stagnant and below the 2000 level, \nsuggesting that nominal wage growth did not catch up with an increase in prices. In the \nfirst 9 months of 2018, moreover, the average rate of real wage growth was only 0.3% \nand that of real basic pay recorded \u20130.2%.  \n\nWith  regards  to  wage  perceptions,  many  households  claim  that  they  feel  that  wages \nhave  remained  unchanged.  According  to  the  BOJ\u2019s  Opinion  Survey  on  the  General \nPublic's Views and Behavior, the percent share of the number of respondents choosing \nthat their \u201cpresent income level has increased compared with one year ago\u201d rose only \nto  14%  in  the  latest  September  2018  survey\u2014from  10.5%  in  the  June  2006  survey \n(survey  introduced  from  this  month)  and  from  7%  in  the  March  2013  survey  (prior  to \nQQE).  Among  the  remaining  respondents  in  the  September  2018  survey,  53%  of  \nthe  respondents  chose  that  their  income  \u201chas  remained  the  same\u201d  while  33%  chose \nthat  their  income  \u201chas  declined.\u201d  These  results  are  consistent  with  sluggish  total  \ncash earnings.  \n\nFigure 6: Nominal and Real Total Cash Earnings (Year 2000=100) \n\nNote: Data for fiscal year 2018 use the y/y growth rate for January\u2013June 2018.  \n\nSource: The Ministry of Labor, Health and Welfare. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\nIn addition to the current wage performance, many households claim that they do not \nexpect  that  wages  will  increase  in  the  near  future.  According  to  the  BOJ\u2019s  Opinion \nSurvey on the General Public's Views and Behavior, the percent share of the number \nof  respondents  choosing  that  their  outlook  for  income  from  one  year  from  now  \u201cwill \nincrease\u201d remained low at 10% in the latest September 2018 survey\u2014barely changing \nfrom 8.8% in the June 2006 survey and from 9.5% in the March 2013 survey. Among \nthe remaining respondents, the percent share of the number of respondents that chose \ntheir outlook for income \u201cwill remain the same\u201d was 58% while 33% chose \u201cwill decline\u201d \naccording to the September 2016 survey.  \n\nSecond,  many  households  worry  about  their  life  in  old  age.  According  to  the  annual \nPublic  Opinion  Survey  on  Households\u2019  Financial  Assets  and  Liabilities  conducted  by \nthe  Central  Council  for  Financial  Services  Information  and  its  Related  Organizations \n(Secretariat  located  at  the  BOJ),  the  percentage  of  households  responding  that  they \n\u201chold  some  financial  assets\u201d  dropped  to  69%  in  the  latest  2017  survey\u2014from  88%  in \nthe  2000  survey  and  74%  in  the  2012  survey.  This  suggests  that  the  number  of \nhouseholds  that  do  not  hold  any  financial  assets  has  increased  over  time.  Moreover, \nthe  percentage  of  households  responding  that  they  \u201cworry  about  life  in  old  age\u201d \nrecorded  82%  in  the  latest  2017  survey\u2014rising  from  79%  in  the  2000  survey  and \nmaintaining  the  same  82%  in  the  2012  survey.  Concerns  about  the  social  security \nsystem  including  public  pensions,  elderly  care,  and  medical  insurance  are  major \nreasons why many households are willing to save. Indeed, households have remained \noverly risk averse and have allocated more than a half of their financial assets to cash \nand  deposits,  so  little  returns  have  been  generated  in  the  current  substantially  low \ninterest rate environment, as pointed out below. \n\n4.4  Upward Bias in Households\u2019 Price Perception  \n\nand Inflation Expectation  \n\nThird,  households\u2019  spending  has  been  weak  partly  because  of  strong  upward  bias  in \ntheir  price  perception  and  inflation  expectation.  This  means  that  households  have  an \ninflationary mindset rather than deflationary mindset claimed by the BOJ. This occurred \neven when the rate of actual CPI-based inflation was negative in 2009\u20132012 and 2016. \nThis appears to be a reflection of the fact that households\u2019 real disposable income have \nnot  risen  since  the  early  2000s  due  to  rising  food  prices  and  oil  prices,  as  well  \nas  stagnant  present  incomes  and  income  prospects.  Due  to  the  resultant  tighter \nhousehold  budgets  and  their  outlook,  they  appear  to  feel  that  prices  have  gone  up  \nand prices will go up. This is consistent with the fact that the their spending has been \nvery  sensitive  to  the  prices  of  daily  goods  and  services.  A  recent  example  is  the \nJanuary\u2013March  quarter  of  2018,  when  the  contribution  of  consumption  to  real  GDP \ngrowth turned negative due to higher food prices caused by bad weather. The upward \nbias  remained  unchanged  before  and  after  QQE.  Figure  7  indicates  that  households\u2019 \nperceived  rate  of  inflation  (a  rate  of  current  perceived  price  change  as  compared  to  \none year ago) as well as long-term inflation expectations (over the next 5 years) have \nremained not only positive but also very high.  \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\nFigure 7: Households\u2019 Perceived Inflation and Inflation Expectation  \n(%) \n\nSource: Bank of Japan. \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that the majority of respondents consistently held the view that price \nrises are unfavorable before and after QQE. According to the BOJ\u2019s Opinion Survey on \nthe  General  Public's  Views  and  Behavior,  the  percentage  of  respondents  choosing \n\u201cprices have gone up significantly\u201d or \u201cprices have gone up slightly\u201d compared with one \nyear  ago  rose  to  70%  in  the  latest  September  2018  survey\u2014from  54%  in  the  June \n2006 survey and 46% in the March 2013 survey. The percentage rose to the maximum \n86%  in  2015  after  the  consumption  tax  hike  in  fiscal  year  2014  and  the  sharp \ndepreciation  of  the  yen.  Around  80%  of  the  respondents  who  had  perceived  there  to  \nbe  a  price  rise  over  the  past  year  commented  that  such  price  rises  were  \u201crather \nunfavorable.\u201d  This  ratio  was  no  different  before  or  after  the  adoption  of  QQE.  These \nresponses  imply  that  the  importance  of  achieving  the  2%  target  has  not  been  widely \nunderstood  and  shared  by  households.  Without  households\u2019  acceptance  of  a  price \nhike,  achieving  2%  sustainably  is  a  challenging  task.  The  BOJ\u2019s  aforementioned \nopinion survey indicates that there appears little public support for the 2% price stability \ntarget to begin with. In addition, households\u2019 awareness of the 2% target has been low \nand even declined from 37% in the September 2013 survey (the first survey) to 27% in \nthe latest September 2018 survey. Their awareness of QQE and/or yield curve control \ndropped sharply from 29% to 21% over the same period.  \n\nIf  these  three  factors\u2014(1)  sluggish  wages  and  wage  expectation,  (2)  concerns  about \nlife in old age, and (3) high price perceptions and inflation expectations\u2014are deterring \nhouseholds  from  increasing  their  spending,  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  yen\u2019s \ndepreciation and higher commodity prices could really contribute to raising households\u2019 \nconsumption  without  giving  rise  to  anxiety  about  the  cost  of  living.  It  could  result  \nin  cost-driven  increases  in  spending  on  essential  goods  and  services  rather  than \ndemand-driven increases in spending on nonessential goods and services. \n\nIn my  view,  the expression the prevalence of deflation-oriented mindsets\u2014often used \nby  the  BOJ  and  the  government  to  describe  Japan\u2014seems  to  have  been  very \napplicable  to  the  mindset  of  the  corporate  sector.  It  refers  to  firms\u2019  deflationary \nexpectations and associated cautious price-setting behavior. The household sector, by \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\ncontrast,  tended  to  form  high  price  perception  and  inflation  expectations  reflecting  \nlong-standing  stagnant  income  growth  and  anticipated  tighter  budgets.  As  a  result, \nwhenever  households\u2019  present  perceived  inflation  rose,  their  tolerance  for  price  rises \ndropped, fostering a negative correlation between them. Based on this perception and \nthus  resistance  to  price  hikes,  firms  appear  to  have  found  it  difficult  to  raise  sales \nprices, contributing to a widespread use of discount-based marketing strategies. In the \nBOJ\u2019s latest September 2018 Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises (TANKAN), \nabout 70% of respondents thought output prices would rise by \u201caround zero percent\u201d in \nthe year ahead. Together with \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d responses, the ratio was over 80%. Thus, it \nis  very  unlikely  that  firms  would  actively  raise  their  sales  prices  over  the  next  year \neither to reflect their increased input cost or to raise profitability. Regarding the 3-year \nand  5-year  horizons,  it  is  interesting  that  \u201caround  zero  percent\u201d  responses  were \nreplaced  by  \u201cdon\u2019t  know\u201d  responses.  The  ratio  of  \u201caround  zero  percent\u201d  and  \u201cdon\u2019t \nknow\u201d  for  3  years  ahead  was  about  40%  and  about  20%,  respectively.  Those  for  \n5 years ahead were about 30% and about 40%, respectively. Combining these ratios \namounted to over 60% for both 3 years ahead and 5 years ahead. Therefore, there is a \nhigh degree of uncertainty with respect to the price-setting environment for firms as the \nlength of the projection period increases. \n\n4.5  Is Portfolio Rebalance Taking Place in Japan? \n\nThe portfolio rebalancing channel achieved through large-scale asset purchases is one \nof  the  major  transmission  channels  envisaged  by  a  central  bank  under  the  zero  \nor  effective  lower  bound  (Joyce  et  al.  2012).  To  realize  this  channel,  the  BOJ  also \nlaunched  QQE  hoping  that  the  portfolio  rebalancing  channel  would  raise  aggregate \ndemand  and  inflation  by  encouraging  investors  to  change  the  composition  of  their \nportfolios,  thereby  lowering  funding  costs  and  raising  various  asset  prices  directly. \nHouseholds  traditionally  prefer  banks  deposits.  Deposits  and  cash  accounted  for \naround 50% of households\u2019 total financial assets from 2000 to 2018. Such large-scale \nholdings of deposits are quite remarkable given that the deposit interest rate is about \n0%.  The  household  sector  has  remained  a  substantial  net  creditor  as  households\u2019 \ndeposits for a long time. Since their deposits grew faster than their loans, the deposits \nto  loans  ratio  rose  over  the  period  since  the  adoption  of  the  QQE\u2014contrary  to  the \nphenomenon expected under the portfolio rebalancing channel. QQE only  moderately \ncontributed  to  raising  households\u2019  equity  and  investment  fund  share  holdings  as  a \nshare  of  total  financial  assets.  Instead,  QQE  encouraged  the  participation  of  active \nforeign investors more than individuals (Shirai 2018f).  \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe BOJ has been struggling with sluggish underlying inflation despite the large scale \nof monetary accommodation and the diversity of tools adopted. While the BOJ\u2019s super-\neasy  monetary  policy  has  contributed  to  the  yen\u2019s  depreciation,  higher  stock  prices, \nand  higher  corporate  profits,  its  adverse  impact  on  financial  institutions  and  deep \ndistortion  in  the  financial  and  capital  markets  have  become  prevalent.  The  decline  in \nthe  functioning  of  the  JGB  market  is  a  growing  concern  given  its  disproportionately \nlarge size in the debt securities market and its role of providing a benchmark for pricing \ncorporate bonds and loans. Moreover, concern has been growing about the decline in \nmarket functioning in the stock market due to reduced downside risk; overvaluation of \nsome small-cap stocks; the potential adverse impact on corporate governance because \nof the growing presence of the BOJ as a large silent investor without actively exercising \nvoting  rights;  and  its  impact  on  the  BOJ\u2019s  balance  sheet  risks  (Shirai  2018a,  2018f, \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 896 \n \n\nS. Shirai \n\n2018g). Therefore, the BOJ is expected to take greater steps toward normalization of \nmonetary policy before underlying inflation approaches 2%. Leaving room for additional \nmonetary accommodation in the event of severe recession is also essential.  \n\nWith the possible phasing out of the program in mind, the BOJ explicitly expanded the \ntarget range to \u00b10.2% and effectively raised the yields of 10 years and longer, as well \nas  introduced  flexibility  with  regards  to  ETF  purchases  that  would  enable  it  to \nundertake \u201cstealth tapering.\u201d For the time being, the BOJ should try to tacitly reduce the \nannual  pace  of  ETF  purchases  toward  about  \u00a53  trillion\u2014the  level  before  the  2016 \nexpansion,  while  maintaining  the  official  annual  target  of  \\6  trillion  described  in  the \nStatement  on  Monetary  Policy.  It  is  better  to  reduce  ETFs  when  corporate  profits \nremain  high,  the  Japanese  economy  is  expanding,  and  the  US  dollar  is  strong.  The \nBOJ could then also further expand the target range for yields on 10-year bonds from \nthe  current  \u00b10.2%  range  and  reduce  JGB  purchases  to  the  level  of  net  issuance  \n(about \u00a520 trillion annually). \n\nBefore taking any decisive steps toward monetary policy normalization, the BOJ needs \nto  introduce  flexibility  in  interpreting  the  2%  price  stability  target\u2014such  as  the \nincorporation of the 1% upper and lower range (\u00b11%) of the target into the 2% target. \nThe BOJ would then not need to abandon the 2% target while in practice aiming at a \n1% figure that would be acceptable to the public. Such flexibility would be better than \nlowering the target from 2% to 1% or abandoning the target since many other central \nbanks  also  utilize  the  target  range  on  their  inflation  target.  A  recent  example  is \nSweden\u2019s  Riskbank,  which  adopted  a  \u00b11%  target  to  the  2%  inflation  target  in  2017. \nMoreover,  a  scheduled  increase  in  the  consumption  tax  in  October  2019  from  8%  \nto  10%  is  expected  to  generate  inflation  above  2%  for  a  year.  That  gives  officials  \nthe  opportunity  to  introduce  a  1%  to  3%  inflation  target  range  that  could  be  easily \npresented to the public.  \n\nOnce the price stability target becomes more flexible, the BOJ may be able to reduce \nall  asset  purchases  more  clearly.  A  cut  in  JGB  and  ETF  purchases  toward  zero\u2014\ncompleting the process to cut the annual purchase amount of JGBs and ETFs may be \nchallenging since the BOJ\u2019s monetary policy is constrained by the forward guidance on \nasset  purchases  as  well  as  the  over-shooting  commitment.  Completing  the  process  \nof tapering out purchases of ETFs and bonds and eliminating the 10-year yield target \nmay take much longer since the Japanese economy may face an economic slowdown \nafter the 2019 consumption tax hike and the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. So, the full \nnormalization  process  of  monetary  policy,  such  as  raising  short-term  interest  rates \n(including a negative interest rate) and reducing the size of the BOJ\u2019s balance sheet is \ndifficult  to  forecast  at  this  stage.  It  will  be  some  time  before  the  BOJ  can  follow  the \nFederal Reserve.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   The  sequence  of  monetary  policy  normalization  is  essential.  Following  the  approach  adopted  by  the \nFederal Reserve, (full) monetary policy normalization -- or clear steps of monetary policy normalization \n\u2013 refers to the phase in which the BOJ begins to reduce its short-term policy rates including the negative \ninterest  rate,  followed  by  a  shrinkage  of  the  balance  sheet.  \u201cSteps  toward  monetary  policy \nnormalization\u201d are not yet clear steps of monetary policy normalization but steps moving closer toward \nnormalization. Steps toward monetary policy normalization includes the phases prior to monetary policy \nnormalization\u2014that  is  the  phases  in  which  the  BOJ  reduces  the  annual  pace  of  financial  assets  (i.e., \nJGBs, ETFs, and J-REITs) toward zero and raises the 10-year yield target (and eventually eliminating \nthe 10-year target).

Therefore,  the  BOJ  will  eventually \nneed to make it more sustainable before underlying inflation approaches 2%.
