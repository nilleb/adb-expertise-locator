We find that both can occur: while the service sector tends to agglomerate, the \nmanufacturing sector may decentralize; moreover, economic activities may agglomerate from distant \nareas to the core, while dispersing from the core toward its periphery at the same time. The service \nsector is crucial in this process because, unlike other land transport infrastructure, HSR mainly saves \ntransport time for people, but not cargo. Incorporating this feature to the model of Ottaviano et al. \n(2002), we show that HSR can lead to either polarization or diffusion depending on sector and \ndistance between cities. This is supported by empirical evidence from the 1982 opening of two major \nHSRs in Japan (Shinkansen), which saved intercity travel time by as much as half. We find that in \nnoncore areas service employment decreased by 7%, while manufacturing employment increased by \n21%; cities within approximately 100 kilometers of Tokyo expanded, while more distant cities shrank.

INTRODUCTION \n \nAlmost 4 decades after the first wave of high-speed rail (HSR) investment in advanced economies, a \nnew wave of investment is taking place globally, especially in developing countries such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Russian Federation, and Brazil (Table 1). The total operating length of HSR \nnetworks globally has grown from 4,864 kilometers (km) in 2000 to 22,954 km by 2014, with 12,754 \nkm under construction and another 18,841 km planned to be constructed before 2025 (Figure 1). The \nsignificant travel time saving greatly improves population mobility, which will likely have profound \nimpact on economic geography. Due to limited research on HSR, there is still a lack of consensus \nregarding the spatial impacts of HSR investment. One major policy debate is on whether HSR can help \nthe growth of lagging economies by improving their connection to core cities, which is commonly \nconsidered  a  major  positive  externality  underlying  government  initiatives  to  support  HSR \ndevelopment, e.g., in the United Kingdom (UK). \n \nTable 1: High-Speed Railroads in Selected Economies \n \nMax.

This feature has \nbeen rarely explored so far.2 To understand the spatial impact of HSR, we extend the model of \nOttaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse (2002) to account for the passenger time saving feature of HSR.3 This \nmodel implies that the impact of HSR on economic geography varies by sector and the distance \nbetween core and noncore cities. If the distance is long, HSR may make the service sector agglomerate \ntoward the core area; in contrast, manufacturing sector may move out of the core city due to its rising \nurban costs (i.e., living and commuting costs). If the distance between core and noncore cities is short, \nthe service sector may decentralize toward the noncore city. These implications are consistent with \npatterns scattered in the empirical literature, although systematic econometric evidence testing them \nis highly limited.4 Below, we first summarize our empirical strategy and findings, we then compare them \nwith the empirical literature. \n \n                                                                 \n2   Existing theories analyzing the spatial impact of transport costs largely focus on the manufacturing sector (trade theory) \nand on the location choices of residents (urban theory), and these are motivated by traditional transport modes, \nespecially trains and automobiles. Trade theory typically suggests that lower transport costs may lead to agglomeration \n(Krugman 1991; Fujita, Krugman, and Venables 1999), while urban theory often finds a decentralization effect within \ntransport cost reduction, such as the monocentric urban models of Alonso (1964) and Fujita (1989). More recent \ntheoretical studies have jointly considered both within-region commuting costs (for passengers) and interregional \ntransport cost (for goods), such as Tabuchi (1998), Murata and Thisse (2005), and Tabuchi and Thisse (2006). In these \nmodels, the decrease in both within-region and interregional transport costs tends to induce agglomeration across \nregions. A series of empirical studies provide evidence on both theories (Baum-Snow 2007, Baum-Snow et al. 2014, Faber \n2014). \n3   Note that this HSR model may not apply to expressways. Although expressway is similar to HSR networks in significantly \nreducing the time costs for passengers, it is also a major transport mode for goods.  \n4   By describing the time patterns of various economic indicators, Chen and Hall (2011) examined the effect of HSRs on \njurisdictions with different distances to London, and they also examine the impact on the service sector. ", "High-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   3 \nWe provide empirical evidence using data from Japan. Japan was the first country to build \nHSR, completing the Tokaido line in 1964 to connect Tokyo and the major cities to its south.5 In 1982, \ntwo new HSRs, Tohoku and Joetsu lines (TJL), were completed to connect Tokyo and a number of \nmajor cities to its north and northwest (Figure 2). This development process of HSR provides a quasi-\nexperimental setting to identify the causal effect of HSR on the economy. Studying Japan\u2019s HSR \nnetworks has several additional advantages. First, given the relatively small geographical scope of Japan \n(comparable with the size of Germany, but with only 11% of area developable), the three HSR lines \ncover the majority of the Japanese population. Hence, population flows into and out of our sample \narea  should  be  limited,  simplifying  the  empirical  analysis.  Second,  despite  its  relatively  small \ngeographical scope, the population and number of municipalities of Japan are large (127 million \npopulation and more than 3,000 municipalities  nationwide), thereby offering a  sufficiently  large \nnumber of observations for econometric estimation. Third, as our sample period (1980\u20132003) is after \nthe  \u201cgolden  era\u201d  of  Japan  and  no  major  reform  events  occurred,  the  confounding  effects  of \nsimultaneous  economic  cycles  are  mitigated.6  Fourth,  high-quality  data  on  the  population  and \nemployment  in  Japan  are  available  at  prefecture  or  municipality  levels  before  and  after  the \nconstruction of HSRs in 1982. \n \nWe apply a standard difference-in-difference (DID) estimation on the panel dataset of Japan \non population and employment, which are disaggregated at the municipality and sector levels. In our \nbaseline exercise, the treatment group includes municipalities along the TJL in northern Japan, while \nthe control group includes those along the Tokaido line (TL), which is in southern Japan. In our \naugmented model, we test the nonlinear distance effect of HSR on agglomeration/dispersion by \nallowing the effect to differ by between noncore municipalities and Tokyo. In addition, we also test the \ntheoretical implication that HSR has differential impact on service and manufacturing sectors. Our \nfindings strongly support theoretical implications. Specifically, we find that the establishment of HSR in \nJapan has induced a significant agglomeration in the service sector toward the Tokyo metropolitan \narea (MA) as well as its peripheral area (within approximately 30 minutes of core Tokyo via HSR). In \ncontrast, the manufacturing sector diffused toward more distant noncore areas. In net, Tokyo MA \npopulation increased by as much as 10.5% due to the TJL. Moreover, the estimated impact of HSR is \nsignificant for working-age population, but insignificant for the youth and aged population.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                 \n5   For example, the one-way trip of 550 km between Tokyo and Osaka requires more than 7 hours by expressway or regular \ntrain. In contrast, it takes 2.5 hours by HSR. \n6   The annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of Japan (at constant prices) reached more than 8% during the period \nof 1955\u20131980 (the post-World War II \u201cgolden era\u201d). It slowed down to less than 4% in the following 2 decades (Japan \nStatistical Yearbook).  \n ", "4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Japan High-Speed Rail Network\n \n(a) 1980                                                                                       (b) 1982 \n       \n \n(c) 2003 \n \n \nSource: Constructed by the authors. \n \n \n ", "High-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   5 \nOur findings are qualitatively consistent with a number of studies on HSRs in Europe, the PRC \nand Japan, even though they provide seemingly contradictory findings.7 Some studies, such as Qin \n(2014), find that noncore jurisdictions are weakened by HSR, while some others, such as Ahlfeldt and \nFeddersen (2010), find the reverse. They may be reconciled when we account for the distances \nbetween the noncore jurisdictions and core cities: when they are close, HSRs may lead to diffusion; \nwhen they are far away, HSRs can lead to agglomeration. For example, the German HSR studied by \nAhlfeldt and Feddersen (2010) is approximately 200 km (Frankfurt\u2013Cologne HSR), while the studies \non  Japan  and  the  PRC  are  commonly  above  500  km.8  Besides  distance,  service  sector  is  also \nunderstudied in the literature. Some descriptive studies, including Chen and Hall (2011, 2012) and \nMurakami and Cervero (2012), examine the service sector and find evidence for the agglomeration of \nknowledge-intensive service in major node cities of HSR. Nevertheless, they do not study the spatial \nreallocation of service sector due to HSR. \n \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, we present our hypotheses based on \na theoretical framework. Section III describes the economic background in Japan. Section IV presents \nthe empirical strategy and describes the dataset. Section V reports the baseline results and robustness \nchecks. Section VI concludes. \n \n \nII.  HYPOTHESES \n \nRegarding the spatial impact of HSRs, the empirical literature has documented a series of patterns on \nagglomeration or diffusion. The majority of studies, though, are based on models that focus on the \nreduction of cargo transport costs or of workers\u2019 commuting time. In this study we emphasize a \ndistinctive feature of HSR: it mainly affect passengers who travel between cities but not for daily \ncommuting. The key implication we draw from this feature is that HSR can help people to travel across \nregions to consume services. Incorporating this to the model of Ottaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse \n(2002) leads to the following testable hypothesis:  \n \n \n                                                                 \n7   There are extensive studies on how traditional transport infrastructure affects economic geography. On the one hand, \nBaum-Snow (2007) provides evidence on the decentralization of the population from the central cities of metropolitan \nstatistical areas in the United States after the opening of interstate highways. Baum-Snow (2014) further exploits the \ndifferent impacts of decentralization on residents and employment and on sectors. By focusing on manufacturing, \nRothenberg (2011) finds that manufacturing activities have relocated along the new highways next to existing urban \ncenters in Indonesia. On the other hand, some evidence supports the agglomeration effect of transport infrastructure. For \nexample, Tang (2014) and Faber (2014) find that manufacturing firms tend to agglomerate in large markets after the \ncreation of new transport infrastructures in Japan and the PRC, respectively. \n8   Econometric studies on the effect of Shinkansen on the distribution of economic activities in Japan are rare. Sasaki, \nOhashi, and Ando (1997) use simulation analysis to show that HSR will not necessarily contribute to regional dispersion. \nMori (2012) observes that as the Tokaido line halved the Osaka\u2013Tokyo travel time from 8 hours to 4 hours in 1964, the \nsize of Tokyo relative to that of Osaka increased from 2.0 times in 1964 to 2.7 times in 2005. Case studies in Okada \n(1994) show that service industries such as tourism, conferences, and exhibitions benefit significantly from nearby HSR \nstations. \n ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \nHypothesis. If the distance between the core and the noncore cities is sufficiently long, \ntransport cost reduction for passengers makes the service sector with increasing returns to scale (IRS) \nagglomerate toward the core city. If the distance is sufficiently short, the cost reduction for passengers \nmakes the service sector with IRS diffuse toward the noncore city. In contrast, the spatial redistribution \nof manufacturing sector shows a contrasting pattern. \n \nPatterns consistent with this hypothesis scattered in existing empirical literature, although they \nhave not been examined systematically. An alternative model on HSR is discussed in Ahlfeldt and \nFeddersen (2010), which also pay explicit attention to the propassenger feature of HSR. This study \nfocuses on the manufacturing sector, though, and the argument is that HSRs may also affect the \nmarketing and distribution costs of manufactured goods. Moreover, Ahlfeldt and Feddersen (2010) \nallow HSRs to affect the commuting costs of residents. In our model, we explicitly assume that HSRs \ndo not affect the commuting costs, which is the case in Japan (see section III for details).9 As we are \nessentially  using  the  model  of  Ottaviano,  Tabuchi,  and  Thisse  (2002)  and  just  give  it  a  new \ninterpretation, we do not repeat the full model here. Below, we summarize major features of the \nmodel, as well as key results that are relevant to our empirical work.  \n \nTwo-Sector Model \n \nThe economy consists of two regions, H and F. There are farmers as well as workers. Farmers are \nevenly distributed across regions and spatially immobile. Workers are mobile between the two regions, \nand their share in region H is (cid:2019)\t. The economy produces and consumes only two goods. One good \n(food) is homogeneous and tradable without trade costs. It is produced by farmers under constant \nreturns to scale and perfect competition. We treat it as the num\u00e9raire of the economy. The second \ngood (services) is nontradable, horizontally differentiated, and produced by workers under IRS and \nimperfect  competition.  Although  services  are  not  tradable,  people  can  travel  across  regional \nboundaries to consume services. Here we assume that each individual consumes only one service \nvariety on his/her trip to the other region and that the travel cost is \uf074.10 In equilibrium, each individual \nconsumes all varieties of the service goods. His/her budget consists of the wage income and a fixed \nendowment. As there is a one-to-one relationship between firms and varieties in the economy, the \nnumber of firms is the number of varieties. Each firm sets its price to maximize its profit. The model \nassumes identical preferences across individuals represented by a quasi-linear utility function with a \nquadratic subutility: \n \n                                                                 \n9   The model of Bernard, Moxnes, and Saito (2015) also takes into account the feature that HSRs mainly affect the transport \nof people but not goods. The focus of Bernard, Moxnes, and Saito (2015) is specifically on the spatial distribution of \nsuppliers of intermediate goods. \n10   In Ottaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse\u00a0(2002), the second good is a manufactured good, which can be traded at an additive \ncost of \u03c4 per unit of the good transported from one region to the other. Given our assumption for interregional \nconsumption of service, our case is mathematically the same as that in Ottaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse\u00a0(2002). Moreover, \nwe follow the original model to assume that service providers can charge different prices on local and nonlocal customers. \nAn example of this is that, in Japan, people who live outside of Tokyo MA can enjoy discounted ticket prices for Tokyo\u2019s \nDisneyland Park by purchasing travel package including accommodation, Disneyland ticket, and high-speed rail ticket.

With the price and consumption \ndetermined, firms\u2019 profits and workers\u2019 wage levels are pinned down. \n \nIn this model transport cost is a key determinant of the consumption of service goods as well \nas the size of the regional economy in equilibrium. Without urban costs, it can be shown that the \neconomy agglomerates when interregional transport costs become sufficiently low.11 As shown in \nEquation  (2),  \uf074*corresponds  to  the  threshold  of  transport  cost  \uf074  and  determines  whether \ndispersion or agglomeration exist in equilibrium. Without loss of generality, assume that region H \n\uf06c\uf03e1/2\nwas originally greater than F, i.e.,  . We refer to H as the core area. When transport cost is \nhigher than \uf074*, cross-regional consumption of service goods is insufficient to sustain agglomeration \nat the city region. People would migrate from the core region H to the noncore region F, resulting in \ndispersion (\uf06c\uf03d1/2) in equilibrium. In contrast, when \uf074 is less than \uf074*, firms in the core region enjoy \nhigher profit than the noncore region due to the large size of the core region.

It suggests that dispersion is also possible when transport cost is low. \n1 2\nThe intuition is the following: when interregional passenger travel cost decreases relatively to the \ncommuting cost and land rent in the core city, it becomes more attractive for workers to live and work \nin \u201ccheaper\u201d noncore area and travel to the core area for service needs. This leads to a rise of \ninterregional service trade. \n \n                                                                 \n11   This is proved in the Proposition 1 of Ottaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse\u00a0(2002). \n ", "8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n \nFigure 3: Spatial Effect of High-Speed Railroad (Equation 3) \n \n \n \nSources: Ottaviano,Tabuchi, and Thisse 2002; Authors\u2019 calculation and construction. \n \nThree-Sector Model \n \nIt  is  desirable  to  have  manufacturing  industry  in  the  model  in  addition  to  service  industry  as \nmanufacturing industry is typically sizable in an economy. Even though an HSR does not directly affect \nthe transport costs of manufactured goods, there may be an indirect effect. For example, changing \nurban costs in the core area may crowd out manufacturing industries. As shown by Tabuchi and Thisse \n(2006), however, adding one more industry to the current model significantly complicates the analysis. \nThis is mainly because HSR not only affects the urban cost in each area, but also changes the relative \nsize of service and manufacturing industries through intersector migration of workers. This may result \nin multiple equilibria. To address this issue, Tabuchi and Thisse (2006) consider several special cases, \none of which is particularly relevant in our case. Below we present this case. \n \nThe  utility  function  now  includes  products  from  all  three  industries  (agriculture, \nmanufacturing, and service). The specification of the utility function encapsulates both the preference \nfor diversity between the service and manufacturing industries, and a preference for variety of goods \nwithin each sector. As workers can choose which industry to work in, the size of an industry is now ", "High-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   9 \nendogenous, depending on the sectoral mobility of workers. Given the setup of Tabuchi and Thisse \n(2006), wages are equalized across regions. \n \nConsider a special case in which the transport cost is positive for the service industry, but is \nzero for the manufacturing industry. This simplifies the problem as the price of a manufactured good is \nequal in the two regions. Given the higher urban costs in the core area, it is clearly more beneficial for \nmanufacturers to move from the core area to the noncore area. It can be shown that the unique stable \nequilibrium for a certain range of commuting cost is that the service industry (industry 2 in their case) \nis fully concentrated in the core area, while the manufacturing industry (industry 1 in their case) exists \nin both regions.12\n \n \n \nIII.  EMPIRICAL SETTING \n \nOur quasi-experimental exercise critically depends on the development timing of the HSR network in \nJapan, which we detail in this section. Moreover, we also examine the macroeconomic environment, \nincluding  the  evolution  of  industry  structure  and  population  dynamics,  which  are  potential \nconfounding factors. \n \nA.  High-Speed Railroad Development in Japan \n \nJapan has 47 prefecture-level jurisdictions and more than 3,000 municipalities during most of our \nsample period.13 Its capital city, Tokyo, is located near the country\u2019s geographic center and close to the \neast coast. Tokyo and 33 other prefectures are located in Honshu, the largest and most populous \nisland of Japan (Figure 4). With a length of 1,300 km and width not more than 230 km, Honshu\u2019s \npopulation in 2014 was 103 million, approximately 80% of Japan\u2019s total population. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                 \n12   Proposition 3 of Tabuchi and Thisse (2006). \n13   This refers to our study period during 1980\u20132003.

The Tokaido line halved the travel time between these two cities from 8 hours \non a conventional train to 4 hours. The travel time was further shortened to 2.5 hours by 1992 due to \nimproved HSR technology (Figure 5).

The cities along the southern lines \n(Tokaido line) offer a natural control group, while those along the northern part (Joetsu and Tohoku \nlines) are the treatment group. The geographic scope of Japan conforms well with the competitiveness \nrange of HSR: with Tokyo in the middle of Honshu, the majority of cities are within 600 km of Tokyo. \nAlso importantly, Tokyo MA, including four prefectures Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama, is the \nlargest MA of Japan, with population accounting for 24.5% of Japan\u2019s population in 1980 and 27.8% by \n2010  (Japan  Statistical  Yearbook).18  This  gives  us  a  mono-center  setting,  which  helps  test  the \nimplication of the model. \n \nB.  Macroeconomic Environment \n \nIn this section, we examine macroeconomic factors that could confound our empirical estimates, \nincluding economic cycles, spatial population movement due to non-HSR factors, and the evolving \neconomic structure. After the Second World War, the annual growth domestic product (GDP) of \nJapan first grew rapidly, averaging 10% during 1961\u20131970, but then moderated to less than 5% between \n1971 and 1990 (Japan Statistics Bureau).

The agglomeration toward Tokyo was \nevident, with the population share of Tokyo MA increasing significantly (Figure 8), whereas those of \nOsaka and Nagoya MAs have stagnated or declined since the 1980s.

First is the sharp growth slowdown, especially around 1991, as well as the surge and \ncollapse of property prices nationwide. Second, the urbanization trend is more worrisome, as it can \ndirectly confound the agglomeration effect of HSR. To address this concern, our empirical strategy is ", "High-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   15 \nto use the DID estimation method, which is detailed in the following section. Moreover, we shall also \nconduct a number of robustness checks, including estimation using alternative control groups and \ndifferent subsample periods, as well as controlling for pre-existing trends. \n \n \nIV.  EMPIRICAL STRATEGY \n \nUtilizing the empirical setting of Japan and its comprehensive data on demographics and employment, \nwe propose to test the theoretical implications in section II with a DID methodology. We first present \nthe dataset, and then discuss in detail our model specification and identification strategy. \n \nA.  Data \n \nOur database is compiled from several sources. It includes annual residential population from 1980 to \n2003 at the municipality level, from 1950 to 2003 at the prefecture level, and employment from 1980 \nto 2000 at a 5-year frequency at the municipality level.20 In addition, we also obtain information on the \nlongitude and latitude information of municipalities to calculate their geographic distances to central \nTokyo.21 The timing of HSR construction and operation, as well as the location of HSR stations, are \nbased on publicly available reports. \n \nAs discussed in section III, our main regression sample covers 13 prefectures. The treatment \ngroup  includes  seven  prefectures  along  TJL,  namely  Tochigi,  Fukushima,  Miyagi,  Iwate,  Aomori, \nGunma,  and  Niigata,  consisting  of  515  municipalities  in  total.  Our  control  group  includes  six \nprefectures along the Tokaido line, namely Shizuoka, Gifu, Shiga, Aichi, Osaka, and Kyoto, including \n450 municipalities altogether. Table 3 provides summary statistics on the main variables. Jurisdictions \nalong TJL are similar to those along Tokaido line in terms of average distance to Tokyo. In terms of \nlocal population and employment sizes, those along Tokaido line are larger than the treatment group \non  average.  Population  has  grown  slowly  in  the  control  group,  while  shrinking  modestly  in  the \ntreatment group. The pattern of change in industrial structure conforms well with the theoretical \nimplication: in jurisdictions along TJL, the growth in service employment is slower but the growth in \nmanufacturing employment is higher than in the control group. In fact, manufacturing employment in \nthe control group shrunk during 1980\u20132003, while that in the treatment group grew. \n \n \n                                                                 \n20   Municipalities are identified by the five-digit administrative division code. Japan imposed a policy called the Great Heisei \nMergers (heisei-no-daigappei) in 1999 to merge the municipalities and decrease the number of municipality. Nevertheless, \nlarge-scale mergers did not start until 2004. During 1999\u20132003, the number of municipalities remained stable (3,232 in \n1999 and 3,212 in 2003). \n21   Data of residential population are from Residential Population Survey conducted by Local Administration Bureau, \nMinistry of Internal Affairs and Communications annually from 1980\u20132003. Data on employment by industry are from \nPopulation Census of Japan by Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

(R.1) \n \nThe dependent variable is the logarithm of economic activity indicators, such as residential \npopulation and employment, for municipality i at time t. On the right-hand side of the model, the \nvariable TJL is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if municipality i is in a prefecture with stations on the \ni\nTohoku or Joetsu lines and equal to 0 for prefectures along the Tokaido line. Another dummy variable \nD1982 indicates whether the observation is after 1982 (1 for years later than 1982 and 0 otherwise), as \nt\nthis is the year in which the Tohoku and Joetsu lines opened (on November 15, 1982). The coefficient \nof the interaction of TJL and D1982, \uf061, measures the average treatment effect of the Tohoku and \ni t 1", "High-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   17 \nJoetsu lines on local economic activities. \uf061 has a negative sign if lower transport cost drives economic \n1\nactivities to agglomerate from noncore areas toward the core, Tokyo MA in our case. By contrast, a \npositive \uf061 indicates a dispersion effect. Note that Tokyo MA is automatically dropped from the data \n1\nsample as it is covered by both the Tokaido line and the Tohoku/Joetsu lines. Hence, the DID \noperation will eliminate all observations in Tokyo MA. \n \nIn this empirical model, we control for municipality and year fixed effects, represented by \uf068i\nand \uf06dt, respectively. We acknowledge that, despite the control of year-specific fixed effects, there \ncould still be region specific unobserved time-varying factors, which can bias our estimates. We use a \nset of variables X , such as highway investment, to control for some time-varying factors. As to the \nit\nremaining  unobserved  heterogeneity,  such  as  macroeconomic  shocks  or  policies,  they  would  be \neliminated under the DID framework given the assumption that their effects are similar on both the \ncontrol and the treatment groups. To address the concern that this assumption may be violated in \nreality, we shall provide additional evidence on the theory-based hypotheses discussed in section II. \nOne implication is that the spatial impact of travel cost reduction depends on the distance between \nnoncore and the core areas (Figure 3). For a municipality along TJL, if it is far from Tokyo, its economy \nmay shrink as the service sector agglomerates toward Tokyo MA. By contrast, for the peripheral of \nTokyo  MA,  its  economic  scale  may  grow,  as  the  spillover  from  the  Tokyo  MA  dominates  the \nagglomeration effect. Based on this theoretical implication, we propose the following specification by \naugmenting model (R.1) with the distance between a jurisdiction i and the core area Tokyo (DST): \ni\n \nln(Y )\uf03d\uf062 \uf02b\uf062ln(DST)\uf0b4TJL \uf0b4D1982 \uf02b\uf062TJL \uf0b4D1982 \uf02b\uf062ln(DST)\uf0b4D1982 \uf02b\uf068\uf02b\uf06d\uf02b\uf065  \nit 0 1 i i t 2 i t 3 i t i t it.   (R.2)\n \nThe main coefficient of interest is \uf062. We expect \uf062 to have a negative sign, as the economic \n1 1\nscale of a municipality is more likely to be negatively impacted by the HSR if the municipality is further \naway from Tokyo. Moreover, we expect \uf062 to be positive. In this case, the time-saving effect of TJL \n2\nwill have a positive effect on the local economic scale if the municipality is sufficiently near to Tokyo \n(i.e., DST is small). \n \nAnother implication is that the impact of HSR differs for service and manufacturing sectors: \nwhile service sector agglomerate toward the core city and its periphery, manufacturing sector may \ndecentralize toward distant cities. We can test this hypothesis by applying model (R.2) to service and \nmanufacturing sectors, respectively. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \nV.  EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE \n \nIn this section, we present estimates on the spatial effects of HSR. We first report jurisdiction-level \nresults, and then provide evidence by service and manufacturing sectors. Both short- and long-term \neffects are shown using different sample periods. In all regressions, test statistics based on robust \nstandard errors clustered at the prefecture level are reported. \n \nA.  Agglomeration or Dispersion: Effect by Distance \n \nIn theory, HSR can lead to either agglomeration or dispersion depending on the distance between the \nnoncore and the core areas. We start our empirical exercise by estimating the average effect of HSR on \nnoncore areas. \n \nAverage effect of HSR on noncore areas \n \nWe first estimate model (R.1) for the average effect of Tohoku and Joetsu lines (TJL) on residential \npopulation  in  noncore  municipalities.  It  is  reflected  by  the  coefficient  of  the  indicator  for  TJL \ncompletion in 1982 (Table 4). The estimate of this coefficient is negative and significant. Specifically, \nthe estimates imply that TJL reduced the population of noncore areas by 5% on average, consistent \nwith agglomeration toward the core area (column 1 of Table 4).  \n \nTable 4: Average Impact of TJL \n \n  (1)  (2) (3) (4) (5) \n  ln(pop)\nTJL*(year>1982)  \u20130.05** \u20130.21*** \u20130.15*** \u20130.03*** \n(0.02)  (0.06)  (0.02)  (0.01) \nTJL*(year>1971)    0.13**  \n(0.05) \nConstant  9.74*** 9.73*** 14.63*** 9.48*** 9.72*** \n(0.02)  (0.01)  (0.05)  (0.02)  (0.00) \nDetrend  N  Y Y Y Y \nPeriod  1980\u20132003 1980\u20132003 1961\u20131982 1980\u20132003 1980\u20131985 \nN  22,624 22,624 286 12,181 5,636 \nR2  0.023 0.132 0.750 0.162 0.227 \n \nTJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines. \nNotes: Dependent variable is the logarithm of population at municipality (prefecture, for column 3) \nlevel.

We  need  to  distinguish  between  two  situations.  One  is  that  the  pre-existing  trends  are \nuncorrelated  with  the  expectations  of  TJL  completion.  If  this  is  the  case,  we  may  detrend  the \npopulation data by subtracting the pre-1982 time trends in both the treatment and the control groups ", "High-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   19 \n(column 2).22 With this approach, the estimated effect of TJL on the population increases to 0.21. This \nestimate implies that approximately three million residents in treated regions have migrated to Tokyo \nMA due to TJL, increasing the population of Tokyo MA by 10.5% and accounting for 44% of Tokyo MA \npopulation increase from 1982 to 2003.23 \n \nAs another situation, the pre-existing migration trend of people might have been driven by the \nexpectation of TJL. With the ministerial approval of TJL construction in 1971, people in noncore areas \nalong TJL might expect population outflow and falling property prices. As a result, they could migrate \nto the core city even before the line was completed. To address this concern, we reestimate model \n(R.1) using prefecture population data, which cover 1961\u20131982 (data are detrended using data of \n1950\u20131960). Instead of using 1982 as the start year of TJL, we use 1971, the year of approval. This \nestimate is to test whether the population agglomeration to Tokyo MA has already started after the \napproval of TJL project. The estimated coefficient of HSR is positive (column 3), contrasting our \nprevious estimation. This is inconsistent with the hypothesized \u201capproval effect\u201d as discussed. \n \nIn column 4, we estimate the standard OLS model for comparison, without using the control \ngroup. In this approach, the residential population is estimated to decline by 16% due to the TJL \noperation, which is slightly less than the DID estimate. Therefore, omitting the control group would \nbias our estimate of the TJL effect downward. \n \nPrevious estimates are for long-term effect over 2 decades following the completion of TJL. A \ntypical concern is that some other confounding factors arising during this long time period may bias \nour estimates, such as the housing price collapse. To address this concern, we conduct a series of \nestimates for different sample time periods. We find that the effect of TJL remained negative and \ngradually strengthened as time period lengthens (Figure 10). To illustrate, column 5 reports the \nestimate for 1980\u20131985, covering 3 years after the completion of TJL. The average impact on the \npopulation  was  estimated  to  be  one-seventh  of  the  estimate  during  1980\u20132003,  but  remains \nstatistically significant. \n \nEffects by Distance \n \nAn important implication of theory is that the effect of HSR on a noncore area varies by its distance to \nthe core area. When distance is long, HSR leads to agglomeration toward the core city; when distance \nis short, rising urban costs due to congestion effect dominate the agglomeration force, leading to \ndecentralization. \n \n                                                                 \n22   As the municipality-level data series have only 2 years of observations before 1982, we construct the pre-1982 trend by \nusing prefecture-level data. We first use the prefecture-level data from 1970 to 1980 to construct a (linear) projection of \nthe population growth rate during 1980\u20132003 for each prefecture. We then detrend the original municipality population \ndata by subtracting them by the prefecture-level population increase implied by pre-1982 trend. \n23   During 1982\u20132003, population size of Tokyo MA increased from 28.7 to 35.5 million. \n ", "20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \nTo have a first-pass check of the hypothesis, we plot the municipality-level population growth \nrates during 1982\u20132003 against the distances between municipalities and Tokyo (Figure 9). The \npopulation growth of municipalities in the treated group shows a negative relation with the distance to \nTokyo, while there is a flat (or slightly positive) relationship for the control group. Next we examine the \nrelationship more rigorously by estimating model (R.2) using detrended municipality-level data for \n1980\u20132003. The coefficient of the three-way interaction between TJL, the D1982 indicators, and the \ndistance to Tokyo is \u20130.19, meaning that the negative effect of TJL on the population of a noncore city \nbecomes larger if it is further away from Tokyo (column 1 of Table 5). Together with the coefficient of \nthe interaction of the TJL and post-1982 indicators, 0.86, the model suggests that municipalities near \nTokyo  (within  92  km  (=e(0.86/0.19))  of  central  Tokyo)  experienced  a  population  increase  as  a \nconsequence of TJL. By contrast, the population of more distant municipalities shrank. This finding is \nconsistent with the model implication: the peripheral of the core area may benefit from its spillover \nbecause of the rising urban costs in the core city. As a robustness check, we conduct a regression using \noriginal municipality data without detrending (column 2). The estimates are smaller in magnitude, but \nshow similar patterns to that of the previous regression. The implied \u201cboundary\u201d of the peripheral that \nbenefit from the spillover effect in Tokyo MA is approximately 130 km from central Tokyo. \n \nFigure 9: Population Growth in Treatment and Control \nMunicipalities (TJL versus TL) \n \nTJL population growth TL population growth\n1 1\n) )\n2 2\n8 8\n9 9\np. 1 .5 p. 1 .5\no o\np p\n( (\nn n\n-l -l\n3) 0 3) 0\n0 0\n0 0\n2 2\np.  p. \no o\np p\n(\u2013.5 (\u2013.5\nn n\nl l\n\u20131 \u20131\n0 200 400 600 800 100 200 300 400 500\nDistance_Tokyo (km) Distance_Tokyo (km)  \n \nkm = kilometer, TJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines, TL = Tokaido line. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n \nAs shown in Figure 9, municipalities in the treatment group tend to be more remote to Tokyo. \nWe estimate (R.2) using municipalities with a common support, namely, with similar distances to \nTokyo. Results presented in column 3 are essentially unchanged. Moreover, as some municipalities in \nthe control group (mostly in regions around Nagoya and Osaka) experienced rapid population growth \nin the study period, they might have a significant influence on our results.

To test this implications, we group the population as the youth (<15 years old), the aged \n(>64 years old), and the working age (15\u201364 years old), and run the baseline regressions on each group \nseparately (Table 6). Consistent with the expectation, we find that the estimate for the working-age \npopulation is the most significant in terms of magnitude, doubling that for the full sample (column 1 of \nTable 6). The estimated gradient of agglomeration is also steeper for the working-age group (column 2 \nof Table 6).

Impact by Sector \n \nAs discussed, the direct effect of HSR is on service industries, while the effect on manufacturing \nindustries is indirect and possible reverse to that for service. In this section, we test these implications \nusing data on employment, which are disaggregated by sector and municipality levels. Municipality \nlevel employment data are available only from 1980 to 2000 at a 5-year frequency. Therefore, we are \nnot able to detrend the employment data as we do for population. Nevertheless, according to our \nfindings  earlier,  estimation  based  on  both  detrended  and  original  data  show  results  that  are \nqualitatively similar. \n \nWe first plot the change of service\u2013manufacturing employment ratio at the municipality level \nduring 1982\u20132003 against the distance between the municipalities and Tokyo for the treatment and \ncontrol groups, respectively (Figure 11). The patterns are consistent with our hypothesis: along the TJL \nline,  service/manufacturing  ratio  increases  in  municipalities  closer  to  Tokyo  but  decreases  in \nmunicipalities that are further away. In contrast, this pattern does not appear in the control group. \nFormal regression results are presented in Table 7. The average effect of HSR on service sector \nemployment  of  noncore  areas  is  \u20137%  and  statistically  significant,  which  is  consistent  with \nagglomeration toward Tokyo (column 1). In contrast, the manufacturing sector decentralized due to \nHSR: employment in the manufacturing sector of noncore municipalities is estimated to increase by \n21% after the opening of TJL (column 3). \n \nFigure 11: Employment Growth in Treated and Control \nMunicipalities (TJL versus TL) \n \nTJL employment (serv/manu) TL employment (serv/manu)\n0)) 0))\n8 8\n9 3 9 3\nu. 1 u. 1\nn n\na a\nm m\n0)-ln( 2 0)-ln( 2\n0 0\n0 0\n2 2\nnu.  1 nu.  1\na a\nm m\nn( n(\n0)-(l 0 0)-(l 0\n8 8\n9 9\nv. 1 v. 1\ner er\nn(s \u20131 n(s \u20131\n0)-l 0)-l\n0 0\n0 0\n2 2\nv.  \u20132 v. \u20132\nn(ser 0 200 400 600 800 n(ser 100 200 300 400 500\nl Distance_Tokyo (km) l Distance_Tokyo (km)  \n \nkm = kilometer, TJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines, TL = Tokaido line. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n \n \n ", "24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n \nTable 7: Impact of TJL by Service and Manufacturing Industries \n \n  (1) (2) (3) (4) \n  ln(service employ) ln(manu. employ) \nTJL*(year>1982)  \u20130.07** 0.72*** 0.19*** \u20130.99** \n(0.03)  (0.18)  (0.05)  (0.38) \nTJL*(year>1982)*ln(DST) \u20130.14*** 0.21*** \n  (0.03)    (0.07) \nConstant  7.92*** 7.92*** 7.35*** 7.35*** \n(0.01)  (0.01)  (0.02)  (0.02) \nN  4,714 4,714 4,714 4,714 \nR2  0.472 0.487 0.188 0.198 \nTJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines. \nNotes: Data is not detrended.

Robustness Checks \n \nAlternative Control Groups \n \nFollowing a common empirical strategy in the literature, we also further examine the impact of HSR on \nmunicipalities with different distances to a TJL station (column 1 of Table 8). Dummy variables \nindicating whether a municipality is within 60 km from an HSR station or greater than 60 km from an \nHSR station are interacted with the indicator of HSR completion and TJL dummy. We find that \nmunicipalities within 60 km suffer the most from the impact of HSR, while municipalities that are 60 \nkm or further away from TJL show insignificant impact. \n \nThe control group of our baseline regressions includes prefectures along the Tokaido line. As a \nrobustness check, we consider an alternative control group, which includes jurisdictions along the \nHokuriku  line  (Ishikawa,  Nagano,  and  Toyama  prefectures).

First, given the size of Osaka, it could have significant economic linkage with \nits nearby areas. This is inconsistent with the setup of our model, in which we assume noncore areas \ntrade with Tokyo MA only. Second, the Sanyo line was completed in 1972 to extend the Tokaido line \nfrom Osaka toward the further south of Japan (Fukuoka). Osaka being the largest city on this line \ncould also experience the agglomeration from jurisdictions along the Sanyo line.  \n \n ", "28   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \nTo address the potential confounding effects of Osaka, we first check the robustness of our \nestimates by excluding Osaka (Table 10). The estimates are generally consistent with our baseline \nresults. Alternatively, we provide direct evidence on the effect of the Sanyo line on Osaka. The \nregression is similar to those in previous exercises (regression models R.1 and R.2), except that our \ntreatment group is now prefectures along the Sanyo line, while the control group is prefectures along \nthe  Tokaido  line  (excluding  Tokyo  MA  and  Osaka).  Our  sample  period  is  from  1960  to  2000 \n(prefecture level). \n \nWe find that the Sanyo line led to a population decline of 8% in non-Osaka areas (column 1 of \nTable 11); however, we do not find significant effect of the distance to Osaka (column 2). We also test \nwith shorter (1960\u20131980, 1960\u20131990) time periods and find similar results.27 These findings suggest \nthat the Sanyo line did induce a population loss in areas to the south of Osaka, although it is unclear \nwhether the lost population moved to Osaka. This could be because Osaka was not a core area, while \nTokyo was. This is in line with the descriptive evidence presented by Mori (2012): after the opening of \nthe Tokaido and Sanyo lines, Osaka MA shrunk because of greater agglomeration to Tokyo MA.  \n \nTable 10: Baseline Results: Excluding Osaka \n \n  (1) (2) (3) \n  ln(pop) ln(service employ) ln(manu. employ) \nTJL*(year>1982)  0.36** 0.71*** \u20130.78* \n(0.15)  (0.23)  (0.47) \nTJL*(year>1982)*ln(DST)  \u20130.07*** \u20130.14*** 0.17* \n(0.03)  (0.04)  (0.09) \nConstant  9.62*** 7.78*** 7.21*** \n(0.01)  (0.01)  (0.02) \nPeriod  1980\u20132003 1980\u20132000 1980\u20132000 \nData frequency  annual 5-year 5-year \nN  21,042 4,385 4,385 \nR2  0.045 0.487 0.196 \nTJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines. \nNotes: Data are not detrended.

CONCLUSION \n \nThis study shows that the spatial impact of HSR is not a simple polarization or diffusion relationship, \nbut depends on the nature of industries and the distance between cities. We first illustrate this utilizing \na core-periphery model, in which passengers can travel across regions to purchase service goods. As \nHSR reduces the interregional travel costs for passengers, the service sector with increasing returns to \nscale may agglomerate toward the core city if its distance with the noncore city is large; if the distance \nis sufficiently small, HSR leads to decentralization of the service sector. The impact of HSR on the \nmanufacturing sector may be the reverse, even though it is not directly affected by HSR. Specifically, \nwhen urban costs are present, HSR may push the manufacturing sector out of the core region toward \ndistant noncore areas. \n \nThese hypotheses are supported by our empirical evidence based on the municipality (or \nprefecture) residential and employment data from Japan. Utilizing the completion of HSR in Japan in \n1982 as a quasi-experiment, we conduct DID estimation with jurisdictions along new HSR as a \ntreatment  group,  and  those  along  the  existing  HSR  as  a  control  group.  We  find  significant \nagglomeration of service industries toward Tokyo MA and its peripheral cities following the completion \nof HSR. Due to the impact of the new HSR, the total scale of Tokyo MA increased by as much as \n ", "30   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n10.5%. The outskirt of Tokyo MA benefited even more than the Tokyo core. In contrast, manufacturing \nindustries  decentralize  toward  distant  noncore  areas.  These  effects  are  consistent  with  theory \nimplications. They persist in both short and long terms. \n \nThese findings reconcile contrasting findings in the literature: while some researchers find that \nHSR leads to agglomeration, some other show evidence on decentralization, depending on the sector \nand spatial scope examined by researchers. Moreover, this study also has implications regarding \ngrowth  strategies.  One  concerns  the  inclusive  growth.  A  common  hypothesis  by  governments \ninvesting in high-speed railroad is to help improve the growth of distant regions (e.g., DFT 2011, for the \nUK). Although HSR may improve people\u2019s mobility and choices of service products, we find no \nevidence that employment increases in distant areas. In fact, more distant noncore cities are likely to \nlose jobs in the service sector, and this is only partly offset by the decentralization of manufacturing \nsector. Moreover, the urbanization strategy of developing countries may also be affected by HSR: the \nsurging HSR investments may generate significant economic agglomeration and formation of mega \ncities due to further agglomeration in service industries. This can have profound implications for urban \npolicies on society, demographics, and environment in the face of the rising wave of high-speed \nrailroad investment around the globe, especially in developing countries. \n \n ", " \nREFERENCES\uf02a \n \nAhlfeldt, G., and A.

We find that both agglomeration and decentralization  \ncould occur. While service industry tends to agglomerate toward the core city, manufacturing industry  \nmay decentralize toward peripheral cities. We estimate that in noncore areas of Japan, service employment  \ndecreased by 7%, while manufacturing employment increased by 21%. Moreover, proximity between  \nperipheral and core cities also matter. Cities within approximately 100 kilometers of Tokyo expanded, while  \nmore distant cities shrank.
