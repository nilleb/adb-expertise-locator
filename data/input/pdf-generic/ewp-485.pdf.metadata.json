We find that both agglomeration and decentralization  \n\ncould occur. While service industry tends to agglomerate toward the core city, manufacturing industry  \n\nmay decentralize toward peripheral cities. We estimate that in noncore areas of Japan, service employment  \n\ndecreased by 7%, while manufacturing employment increased by 21%. Moreover, proximity between  \n\nperipheral and core cities also matter. Cities within approximately 100 kilometers of Tokyo expanded, while  \n\nmore distant cities shrank. The net result is that Tokyo metropolitan area agglomerates because of HSR.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty.

We find that both can occur: while the service sector tends to agglomerate, the \nmanufacturing sector may decentralize; moreover, economic activities may agglomerate from distant \nareas  to  the  core,  while  dispersing  from  the  core  toward  its  periphery  at  the  same  time.  The  service \nsector is crucial in this process because, unlike other land transport infrastructure, HSR mainly saves \ntransport  time  for  people,  but  not  cargo.  Incorporating  this  feature  to  the  model  of  Ottaviano  et  al. \n(2002),  we  show  that  HSR  can  lead  to  either  polarization  or  diffusion  depending  on  sector  and \ndistance between cities. This is supported by empirical evidence from the 1982 opening of two major \nHSRs  in  Japan  (Shinkansen),  which  saved  intercity  travel  time  by  as  much  as  half.  We  find  that  in \nnoncore areas service employment decreased by 7%, while manufacturing employment increased by \n21%; cities within approximately 100 kilometers of Tokyo expanded, while more distant cities shrank. In \nnet, Tokyo metropolitan area agglomerates as a result of HSR. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: economic corridor, high-speed rail, inclusive growth \n \nJEL codes: H54, O18, R12 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\u201cThere is a big debate about the economic benefits of high-speed rail. Bizarrely it has been suggested \nthat HS2 might disadvantage the regions by sucking more economic activity into the south-east than it \ngenerates in the regions.\u201d1 \n \nLord Adonis, former Secretary of State for Transport, UK, 2011 \n\n \n \n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nAlmost 4 decades after the first wave of high-speed rail (HSR) investment in advanced economies, a \nnew wave of investment is taking place globally, especially in developing countries such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Russian Federation, and Brazil (Table 1). The total operating length of HSR \nnetworks globally has grown from 4,864 kilometers (km) in 2000 to 22,954 km by 2014, with 12,754 \nkm under construction and another 18,841 km planned to be constructed before 2025 (Figure 1). The \nsignificant  travel  time  saving  greatly  improves  population  mobility,  which  will  likely  have  profound \nimpact  on  economic  geography.  Due  to  limited  research  on  HSR,  there  is  still  a  lack  of  consensus \nregarding the spatial impacts of HSR investment. One major policy debate is on whether HSR can help \nthe  growth  of  lagging  economies  by  improving  their  connection  to  core  cities,  which  is  commonly \nconsidered  a  major  positive  externality  underlying  government \ninitiatives  to  support  HSR \ndevelopment, e.g., in the United Kingdom (UK). \n \n\nTable 1: High-Speed Railroads in Selected Economies \n \n\nEconomy \nJapan \nFrance \nItaly \nGermany \nSpain \nUnited States \nRepublic of Korea \nTaipei,China \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nTurkey \nRussian Federation \nPortugal \nSweden \nPoland \nBrazil \n\nStart Year \n1964\n1981\n1981\n1988\n1992\n2000\n2004\n2007\n2008\n2009\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\nMax.

This  feature  has \nbeen  rarely  explored  so  far.2  To  understand  the  spatial  impact  of  HSR,  we  extend  the  model  of \nOttaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse (2002) to account for the passenger time saving feature of HSR.3 This \nmodel  implies  that  the  impact  of  HSR  on  economic  geography  varies  by  sector  and  the  distance \nbetween core and noncore cities. If the distance is long, HSR may make the service sector agglomerate \ntoward the core area; in contrast, manufacturing sector may move out of the core city due to its rising \nurban costs (i.e., living and commuting costs). If the distance between core and noncore cities is short, \nthe  service  sector  may  decentralize  toward  the  noncore  city.  These  implications  are  consistent  with \npatterns scattered in the empirical literature, although systematic econometric evidence testing them \nis highly limited.4 Below, we first summarize our empirical strategy and findings, we then compare them \nwith the empirical literature. \n \n\n                                                                 \n2   Existing theories analyzing the spatial impact of transport costs largely focus on the manufacturing sector (trade theory) \nand  on  the  location  choices  of  residents  (urban  theory),  and  these  are  motivated  by  traditional  transport  modes, \nespecially trains and automobiles. Trade  theory typically suggests that lower  transport costs  may lead to agglomeration \n(Krugman  1991;  Fujita,  Krugman,  and  Venables  1999),  while  urban  theory  often  finds  a  decentralization  effect  within \ntransport  cost  reduction,  such  as  the  monocentric  urban  models  of  Alonso  (1964)  and  Fujita  (1989).  More  recent \ntheoretical  studies  have  jointly  considered  both  within-region  commuting  costs  (for  passengers)  and  interregional \ntransport cost (for goods), such as Tabuchi (1998), Murata and Thisse (2005), and Tabuchi and Thisse (2006). In these \nmodels,  the  decrease  in  both  within-region  and  interregional  transport  costs  tends  to  induce  agglomeration  across \nregions. A series of empirical studies provide evidence on both theories (Baum-Snow 2007, Baum-Snow et al. 2014, Faber \n2014). \n\n3   Note that this HSR model may not apply to expressways. Although expressway is similar to HSR networks in significantly \n\nreducing the time costs for passengers, it is also a major transport mode for goods.  \n\n4   By  describing  the  time  patterns  of  various  economic  indicators,  Chen  and  Hall  (2011)  examined  the  effect  of  HSRs  on \n\njurisdictions with different distances to London, and they also examine the impact on the service sector. \n\n\fHigh-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   3 \n\nWe  provide  empirical  evidence  using  data  from  Japan.  Japan  was  the  first  country  to  build \nHSR, completing the Tokaido line in 1964 to connect Tokyo and the major cities to its south.5 In 1982, \ntwo  new  HSRs,  Tohoku  and  Joetsu  lines  (TJL),  were  completed  to  connect  Tokyo  and  a  number  of \nmajor cities to its north and northwest (Figure 2). This development process of HSR provides a quasi-\nexperimental  setting  to  identify  the  causal  effect  of  HSR  on  the  economy.  Studying  Japan\u2019s  HSR \nnetworks has several additional advantages. First, given the relatively small geographical scope of Japan \n(comparable  with  the  size  of  Germany,  but  with  only  11%  of  area  developable),  the  three  HSR  lines \ncover  the  majority  of  the  Japanese  population.  Hence,  population  flows  into  and  out  of  our  sample \narea  should  be  limited,  simplifying  the  empirical  analysis.  Second,  despite  its  relatively  small \ngeographical  scope,  the  population  and  number  of  municipalities  of  Japan  are  large  (127  million \npopulation  and  more  than  3,000  municipalities  nationwide),  thereby  offering  a  sufficiently  large \nnumber of observations for econometric estimation. Third, as our sample period (1980\u20132003) is after \nthe  \u201cgolden  era\u201d  of  Japan  and  no  major  reform  events  occurred,  the  confounding  effects  of \nsimultaneous  economic  cycles  are  mitigated.6  Fourth,  high-quality  data  on  the  population  and \nemployment  in  Japan  are  available  at  prefecture  or  municipality  levels  before  and  after  the \nconstruction of HSRs in 1982. \n \n\nWe apply a standard difference-in-difference (DID) estimation on the panel dataset of Japan \non population and employment, which are disaggregated at the municipality and sector levels. In our \nbaseline exercise, the treatment group includes municipalities along the TJL in northern Japan, while \nthe  control  group  includes  those  along  the  Tokaido  line  (TL),  which  is  in  southern  Japan.  In  our \naugmented  model,  we  test  the  nonlinear  distance  effect  of  HSR  on  agglomeration/dispersion  by \nallowing the effect to differ by between noncore municipalities and Tokyo. In addition, we also test the \ntheoretical  implication  that  HSR  has  differential  impact  on  service  and  manufacturing  sectors.  Our \nfindings strongly support theoretical implications. Specifically, we find that the establishment of HSR in \nJapan  has  induced  a  significant  agglomeration  in  the  service  sector  toward  the  Tokyo  metropolitan \narea (MA) as well as its peripheral area (within approximately 30 minutes of core Tokyo via HSR). In \ncontrast,  the  manufacturing  sector  diffused  toward  more  distant  noncore  areas.  In  net,  Tokyo  MA \npopulation increased by as much as 10.5% due to the TJL. Moreover, the estimated impact of HSR is \nsignificant for working-age population, but insignificant for the youth and aged population.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                                 \n5   For example, the one-way trip of 550 km between Tokyo and Osaka requires more than 7 hours by expressway or regular \n\ntrain. In contrast, it takes 2.5 hours by HSR. \n\n6   The annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of Japan (at constant prices) reached more than 8% during the period \nof 1955\u20131980 (the post-World  War II \u201cgolden  era\u201d). It slowed  down to less than 4% in the following 2 decades (Japan \nStatistical Yearbook).  \n\n \n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\nFigure 2: Japan High-Speed Rail Network\n \n(a) 1980                                                                                       (b) 1982 \n\n \n\n     \n\n(c) 2003 \n\n \n\n \nSource: Constructed by the authors. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fHigh-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   5 \n\nOur findings are qualitatively consistent with a number of studies on HSRs in Europe, the PRC \nand  Japan,  even  though  they  provide  seemingly  contradictory  findings.7  Some  studies,  such  as  Qin \n(2014), find that noncore jurisdictions are weakened by HSR, while some others, such as Ahlfeldt and \nFeddersen  (2010),  find  the  reverse.  They  may  be  reconciled  when  we  account  for  the  distances \nbetween  the  noncore  jurisdictions  and  core  cities:  when  they  are  close,  HSRs  may  lead  to  diffusion; \nwhen  they  are  far  away,  HSRs  can  lead  to  agglomeration.  For  example,  the  German  HSR  studied  by \nAhlfeldt and Feddersen (2010) is approximately 200 km (Frankfurt\u2013Cologne HSR), while the studies \non  Japan  and  the  PRC  are  commonly  above  500  km.8  Besides  distance,  service  sector  is  also \nunderstudied  in  the  literature.  Some  descriptive  studies,  including  Chen  and  Hall  (2011,  2012)  and \nMurakami and Cervero (2012), examine the service sector and find evidence for the agglomeration of \nknowledge-intensive service in major node cities of HSR. Nevertheless, they do not study the spatial \nreallocation of service sector due to HSR. \n \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, we present our hypotheses based on \na theoretical framework. Section III describes the economic background in Japan. Section IV presents \nthe empirical strategy and describes the dataset. Section V reports the baseline results and robustness \nchecks. Section VI concludes. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nHYPOTHESES \n\n \nRegarding the spatial impact of HSRs, the empirical literature has documented a series of patterns on \nagglomeration  or  diffusion.  The  majority  of  studies,  though,  are  based  on  models  that  focus  on  the \nreduction  of  cargo  transport  costs  or  of  workers\u2019  commuting  time.  In  this  study  we  emphasize  a \ndistinctive  feature  of  HSR:  it  mainly  affect  passengers  who  travel  between  cities  but  not  for  daily \ncommuting. The key implication we draw from this feature is that HSR can help people to travel across \nregions  to  consume  services.  Incorporating  this  to  the  model  of  Ottaviano,  Tabuchi,  and  Thisse \n(2002) leads to the following testable hypothesis:  \n \n \n\n                                                                 \n7   There  are  extensive  studies  on  how  traditional  transport  infrastructure  affects  economic  geography.  On  the  one  hand, \nBaum-Snow (2007) provides evidence on the decentralization of the population from the central cities of metropolitan \nstatistical  areas  in  the  United  States  after  the  opening  of  interstate  highways.  Baum-Snow  (2014)  further  exploits  the \ndifferent  impacts  of  decentralization  on  residents  and  employment  and  on  sectors.  By  focusing  on  manufacturing, \nRothenberg  (2011)  finds  that  manufacturing  activities  have  relocated  along  the  new  highways  next  to  existing  urban \ncenters in Indonesia. On the other hand, some evidence supports the agglomeration effect of transport infrastructure. For \nexample,  Tang  (2014)  and  Faber  (2014)  find  that  manufacturing  firms  tend  to  agglomerate  in  large  markets  after  the \ncreation of new transport infrastructures in Japan and the PRC, respectively. \n\n8   Econometric  studies  on  the  effect  of  Shinkansen  on  the  distribution  of  economic  activities  in  Japan  are  rare.  Sasaki, \nOhashi, and Ando (1997) use simulation analysis to show that HSR will not necessarily contribute to regional dispersion. \nMori (2012) observes that as the Tokaido line halved the Osaka\u2013Tokyo travel time from 8 hours to 4 hours in 1964, the \nsize  of  Tokyo  relative  to  that  of  Osaka  increased  from  2.0  times  in  1964  to  2.7  times  in  2005.  Case  studies  in  Okada \n(1994) show that service industries such as tourism, conferences, and exhibitions benefit significantly from nearby HSR \nstations. \n\n \n\n\f6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\nHypothesis.  If  the  distance  between  the  core  and  the  noncore  cities  is  sufficiently  long, \ntransport cost reduction for passengers makes the service sector with increasing returns to scale (IRS) \nagglomerate toward the core city. If the distance is sufficiently short, the cost reduction for passengers \nmakes the service sector with IRS diffuse toward the noncore city. In contrast, the spatial redistribution \nof manufacturing sector shows a contrasting pattern. \n \n\nPatterns consistent with this hypothesis scattered in existing empirical literature, although they \nhave  not  been  examined  systematically.  An  alternative  model  on  HSR  is  discussed  in  Ahlfeldt  and \nFeddersen  (2010),  which  also  pay  explicit  attention  to  the  propassenger  feature  of  HSR.  This  study \nfocuses  on  the  manufacturing  sector,  though,  and  the  argument  is  that  HSRs  may  also  affect  the \nmarketing  and  distribution  costs  of  manufactured  goods.  Moreover,  Ahlfeldt  and  Feddersen  (2010) \nallow HSRs to affect the commuting costs of residents. In our model, we explicitly assume that HSRs \ndo not affect the commuting costs, which is the case in Japan (see section III for details).9 As we are \nessentially  using  the  model  of  Ottaviano,  Tabuchi,  and  Thisse  (2002)  and  just  give  it  a  new \ninterpretation,  we  do  not  repeat  the  full  model  here.  Below,  we  summarize  major  features  of  the \nmodel, as well as key results that are relevant to our empirical work.  \n \nTwo-Sector Model \n \nThe  economy  consists  of  two  regions,  H  and  F.  There  are  farmers  as  well  as  workers.  Farmers  are \nevenly distributed across regions and spatially immobile. Workers are mobile between the two regions, \nand  their  share  in  region  H  is  (cid:2019)\t.  The  economy  produces  and  consumes  only  two  goods.  One  good \n(food)  is  homogeneous  and  tradable  without  trade  costs.  It  is  produced  by  farmers  under  constant \nreturns  to  scale  and  perfect  competition.  We  treat  it  as  the  num\u00e9raire  of  the  economy.  The  second \ngood  (services)  is  nontradable,  horizontally  differentiated,  and  produced  by  workers  under  IRS  and \nimperfect  competition.  Although  services  are  not  tradable,  people  can  travel  across  regional \nboundaries  to  consume  services.  Here  we  assume  that  each  individual  consumes  only  one  service \nvariety on his/her trip to the other region and that the travel cost is \uf074.10 In equilibrium, each individual \nconsumes  all  varieties  of  the  service  goods.  His/her  budget  consists  of  the  wage  income  and  a  fixed \nendowment.  As  there  is  a  one-to-one  relationship  between  firms  and  varieties  in  the  economy,  the \nnumber of firms is the number of varieties. Each firm sets its price to maximize its profit. The model \nassumes  identical  preferences  across  individuals  represented  by  a  quasi-linear  utility  function  with  a \nquadratic subutility: \n \n\n                                                                 \n9   The model of Bernard, Moxnes, and Saito (2015) also takes into account the feature that HSRs mainly affect the transport \nof  people  but  not  goods.  The  focus  of  Bernard,  Moxnes,  and  Saito  (2015)  is  specifically  on  the  spatial  distribution  of \nsuppliers of intermediate goods. \n\n10   In Ottaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse\u00a0(2002), the second good is a manufactured good, which can be traded at an additive \ncost  of  \u03c4  per  unit  of  the  good  transported  from  one  region  to  the  other.  Given  our  assumption  for  interregional \nconsumption of service, our case is mathematically the same as that in Ottaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse\u00a0(2002). Moreover, \nwe follow the original model to assume that service providers can charge different prices on local and nonlocal customers. \nAn example of this is that, in Japan, people who live outside of Tokyo MA can enjoy discounted ticket prices for Tokyo\u2019s \nDisneyland Park by purchasing travel package including accommodation, Disneyland ticket, and high-speed rail ticket. \n\n\fHigh-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niqqU\n0\n\ni\n ),(;\n\n(\n\n\uf0ce\n\n\uf05b\n,0\n\nN\n\n\uf05d\n)\n\nN\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf0f2\n\uf061\n\n0\n\niq\n)(\n\ndi\n\n\uf02d\n\n\uf067\uf062\n\uf02d\n2\n\nN\n\n\uf0f2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\uf05b\niq\n)(\n\n\uf05d\n\ndi\n\n\uf067\n\uf0e9\uf02d\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n2\n\nN\n\n\uf0f2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\niq\n)(\n\ndi\n\n\uf02b\n\nq\n\n0\n\n, \n\n(1) \n\n)(iq\n\nwhere \n\n\uf05b\n,0\uf0ce\nof  varieties.

Without  urban  costs,  it  can  be  shown  that  the \neconomy  agglomerates  when  interregional  transport  costs  become  sufficiently  low.11  As  shown  in \n*\uf074 corresponds  to  the  threshold  of  transport  cost  \uf074  and  determines  whether \nEquation  (2), \ndispersion  or  agglomeration  exist  in  equilibrium.

Even though an HSR does not directly affect \nthe  transport  costs  of  manufactured  goods,  there  may  be  an  indirect  effect.  For  example,  changing \nurban costs in the core area may crowd out manufacturing industries. As shown by Tabuchi and Thisse \n(2006), however, adding one more industry to the current model significantly complicates the analysis. \nThis is mainly because HSR not only affects the urban cost in each area, but also changes the relative \nsize of service and manufacturing industries through intersector migration of workers. This may result \nin multiple equilibria. To address this issue, Tabuchi and Thisse (2006) consider several special cases, \none of which is particularly relevant in our case. Below we present this case. \n \n\nThe  utility \n\nfunction  now \n\nindustries  (agriculture, \nmanufacturing, and service). The specification of the utility function encapsulates both the preference \nfor diversity between the service and manufacturing industries, and a preference for variety of goods \nwithin  each  sector.  As  workers  can  choose  which  industry  to  work  in,  the  size  of  an  industry  is  now \n\nincludes  products \n\nfrom  all  three \n\n\fHigh-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   9 \n\nendogenous,  depending  on  the  sectoral  mobility  of  workers.  Given  the  setup  of  Tabuchi  and  Thisse \n(2006), wages are equalized across regions. \n \n\nConsider  a  special  case  in  which  the  transport  cost  is  positive  for  the  service  industry,  but  is \nzero for the manufacturing industry. This simplifies the problem as the price of a manufactured good is \nequal in the two regions. Given the higher urban costs in the core area, it is clearly more beneficial for \nmanufacturers to move from the core area to the noncore area. It can be shown that the unique stable \nequilibrium for a certain range of commuting cost is that the service industry (industry 2 in their case) \nis fully concentrated in the core area, while the manufacturing industry (industry 1 in their case) exists \nin both regions.12\n \n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nEMPIRICAL SETTING \n\nHigh-Speed Railroad Development in Japan \n\n \nOur quasi-experimental exercise critically depends on the development timing of the HSR network in \nJapan, which we detail in this section. Moreover, we also examine the macroeconomic environment, \nindustry  structure  and  population  dynamics,  which  are  potential \nincluding  the  evolution  of \nconfounding factors. \n \nA. \n \nJapan  has  47  prefecture-level  jurisdictions  and  more  than  3,000  municipalities  during  most  of  our \nsample period.13 Its capital city, Tokyo, is located near the country\u2019s geographic center and close to the \neast  coast.  Tokyo  and  33  other  prefectures  are  located  in  Honshu,  the  largest  and  most  populous \nisland  of  Japan  (Figure  4).  With  a  length  of  1,300  km  and  width  not  more  than  230  km,  Honshu\u2019s \npopulation in 2014 was 103 million, approximately 80% of Japan\u2019s total population. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                                 \n12   Proposition 3 of Tabuchi and Thisse (2006). \n13   This  refers  to  our  study  period  during  1980\u20132003.  After  2003,  the  number  of  municipality-level  jurisdictions  greatly \n\ndecreased because of mergers. \n\n \n\n\f10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Sampled Regions\n \n\nNotes: Prefectures connected by Tohoku and Joetsu lines (TJL) are Tochigi, \nNiigata, Gunma, Fukushima, Miyagi, Iwate, Aomori; Prefectures connected by \nTokaido line (TL) are Shizuoka, Aichi, Gifu, Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka. \nSource: Constructed by the authors. \n\n \n\n \n\nThere was no plan for HSR network development until after the success of the first HSR, the \nTokaido line, which was completed in 1964 to connect Tokyo and the second largest city, Osaka, 515 \nkm south of the capital. The Tokaido line halved the travel time between these two cities from 8 hours \non a conventional train to 4 hours. The travel time was further shortened to 2.5 hours by 1992 due to \nimproved HSR technology (Figure 5). Although the Tokaido line was controversial, it turned out to be \nhighly successfully financially. The first 3 months alone witnessed 11 million passengers (Japan Times \n1965).  Despite  the  high  profitability,  the  fare  of  Tokaido  line  is  reasonable  considering  the  dramatic \nsaving  of  time.

The construction of Sanyo line \nbegan  in  1967  and  its  commercial  service  started  from  1972.  A  more  ambitious  nationwide  HSR \nnetwork  plan  was  announced  in  1967,  including  two  major  lines,  Tohoku  and  Joetsu  lines,  which \nconnect  Tokyo  with  major  cities  in  northwestern  and  northern  Japan,  respectively  (Japan  Times \n1967).15 Ministerial approval for these two lines came through on January 1971 (Leclerc 2002), and the \nconstruction began several months later (Japan Times 1971). For the major parts of the lines, Omiya\u2013\nNiigata (Joetsu line) and Omiya\u2013Morioka (Tohoku line), commercial service began in 1982.

Moreover,  highway \ninvestment was also slow during our study period. The highway length in the study regions increased \nfrom 11,776 to 16,217 km from 1980 to 2003 (with an annual growth rate of 1.4%).16 \n \n\nOur  empirical  exercises  focus  on  the  Tokaido,  Tohoku,  and  Joetsu  lines  (the  Sanyo  and \nHokuriku lines will be examined as additional control group in the robustness check).

The cities along the southern lines \n(Tokaido line) offer a natural control group, while those along the northern part (Joetsu and Tohoku \nlines) are the treatment group. The geographic scope of Japan conforms well with the competitiveness \nrange of HSR: with Tokyo in the middle of Honshu, the majority of cities are within 600 km of Tokyo. \nAlso importantly, Tokyo MA, including four prefectures Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama, is the \nlargest MA of Japan, with population accounting for 24.5% of Japan\u2019s population in 1980 and 27.8% by \n2010  (Japan  Statistical  Yearbook).18  This  gives  us  a  mono-center  setting,  which  helps  test  the \nimplication of the model. \n \nB. \n \nIn  this  section,  we  examine  macroeconomic  factors  that  could  confound  our  empirical  estimates, \nincluding  economic  cycles,  spatial  population  movement  due  to  non-HSR  factors,  and  the  evolving \neconomic  structure.  After  the  Second  World  War,  the  annual  growth  domestic  product  (GDP)  of \nJapan first grew rapidly, averaging 10% during 1961\u20131970, but then moderated to less than 5% between \n1971  and  1990  (Japan  Statistics  Bureau).  During  1985\u20131990,  commercial  land  prices  in  large  cities \nsurged  by  400%,  but  dropped  abruptly  and  sharply  in  1991  and  fell  by  80%  in  total  in  the  following \ndecade  (Japan  Real  Estate  Institute).19  After  1991,  the  economic  growth  of  Japan  stagnated,  with \nannual  GDP  growth  averaging  around  1%.

Meanwhile,  Japan \nwitnessed steady but gradually slowing urbanization, with the urbanization rate increasing from 75.8% \nto 78.2% during 1980\u20132003 (Japan Urban Statistical Yearbook). The agglomeration toward Tokyo was \nevident, with the population share of Tokyo MA increasing significantly (Figure 8), whereas those of \nOsaka  and  Nagoya  MAs  have  stagnated  or  declined  since  the  1980s.  As  a  consequence,  Japan \ngradually developed into a Tokyo-monopolar regional system (Fujita et al. 2004). \n\nFigure 8: Population of Japan, 1960\u20132010\n \n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n20\n15 %\n\n30\n\n25\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\nPop. of Japan\n\nPop. of Honshu\n\nPop. share of Tokyo\nMA in Japan\n(right axis)\n\n \n\nMA = metropolitan area. \nNotes: Tokyo metropolitan area: Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa, Chiba. \nSources: Japan Statistical Yearbook; Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n\n \n\nTo summarize, we need to be wary of several simultaneous macroeconomic trends during our \nsample  period.  First  is  the  sharp  growth  slowdown,  especially  around  1991,  as  well  as  the  surge  and \ncollapse  of  property  prices  nationwide.  Second,  the  urbanization  trend  is  more  worrisome,  as  it  can \ndirectly confound the agglomeration effect of HSR. To address this concern, our empirical strategy is \n\n\fHigh-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   15 \n\nto use the DID estimation method, which is detailed in the following section. Moreover, we shall also \nconduct  a  number  of  robustness  checks,  including  estimation  using  alternative  control  groups  and \ndifferent subsample periods, as well as controlling for pre-existing trends. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nEMPIRICAL STRATEGY \n\nData \n\n \nUtilizing the empirical setting of Japan and its comprehensive data on demographics and employment, \nwe propose to test the theoretical implications in section II with a DID methodology. We first present \nthe dataset, and then discuss in detail our model specification and identification strategy. \n \nA. \n \nOur database is compiled from several sources. It includes annual residential population from 1980 to \n2003 at the municipality level, from 1950 to 2003 at the prefecture level, and employment from 1980 \nto 2000 at a 5-year frequency at the municipality level.20 In addition, we also obtain information on the \nlongitude and latitude information of municipalities to calculate their geographic distances to central \nTokyo.21  The  timing  of  HSR  construction  and  operation,  as  well  as  the  location  of  HSR  stations,  are \nbased on publicly available reports. \n \n\nAs  discussed  in  section  III,  our  main  regression  sample  covers  13  prefectures.  The  treatment \ngroup  includes  seven  prefectures  along  TJL,  namely  Tochigi,  Fukushima,  Miyagi,  Iwate,  Aomori, \nGunma,  and  Niigata,  consisting  of  515  municipalities  in  total.  Our  control  group  includes  six \nprefectures  along  the  Tokaido  line,  namely  Shizuoka,  Gifu,  Shiga,  Aichi,  Osaka,  and  Kyoto,  including \n450 municipalities altogether. Table 3 provides summary statistics on the main variables. Jurisdictions \nalong  TJL  are  similar  to  those  along  Tokaido  line  in  terms  of  average  distance  to  Tokyo.  In  terms  of \nlocal population and employment sizes, those along Tokaido line are larger than the treatment group \non  average.  Population  has  grown  slowly  in  the  control  group,  while  shrinking  modestly  in  the \ntreatment  group.  The  pattern  of  change  in  industrial  structure  conforms  well  with  the  theoretical \nimplication:  in  jurisdictions  along  TJL,  the  growth  in  service  employment  is  slower  but  the  growth  in \nmanufacturing employment is higher than in the control group. In fact, manufacturing employment in \nthe control group shrunk during 1980\u20132003, while that in the treatment group grew. \n \n \n\n                                                                 \n20   Municipalities are identified by the five-digit administrative division code. Japan imposed a policy called the Great Heisei \nMergers (heisei-no-daigappei) in 1999 to merge the municipalities and decrease the number of municipality. Nevertheless, \nlarge-scale mergers did not start until 2004. During 1999\u20132003, the number of municipalities remained stable (3,232 in \n1999 and 3,212 in 2003). \n\n21   Data  of  residential  population  are  from  Residential  Population  Survey  conducted  by  Local  Administration  Bureau, \nMinistry  of  Internal  Affairs  and  Communications  annually  from  1980\u20132003. Data  on  employment  by  industry  are  from \nPopulation Census of Japan by Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Longitude and latitude \ndata for each municipality are obtained from the Center for Spatial Information Science, The University of Tokyo (CSV \nAddress Matching Service), by which we calculate municipality\u2019s distance to core Tokyo. \n\n \n\n\f16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\n \n\nNo. of prefectures \n\nNo. of municipalities \n \n\nDistance to Tokyo (kilometer) \n\nPopulation (pref. level, thousand) \nHighway density (pref. level, \nkilometer/thousand people) \n\nPopulation (muni. level, thousand) \n\n# Age 15\u201364 (% of population) \n\n# Age >64 (% of population) \n\n# Age <15 (% of population) \nEmployment-service (% of total \nemployment) \nEmployment-manufacturing (% of total \nemployment) \n\nPopulation growth(%, annual) \n\nEmployment growth-service (%, 5-year) \nEmployment growth-manufacturing (%, 5-\nyear) \n\nService-manufacturing employment ratio \n\nTable 3: Descriptive Summary of Dataset \n \n\nTohoku and Joetsu Lines\n(treatment) \n\nObs. \n\nStd.

On  the  right-hand  side  of  the  model,  the \n\nvariable TJLi is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if municipality i is in a prefecture with stations on the \nTohoku or Joetsu lines and equal to 0 for prefectures along the Tokaido line. Another dummy variable \n1982 indicates whether the observation is after 1982 (1 for years later than 1982 and 0 otherwise), as \nDt\nthis is the year in which the Tohoku and Joetsu lines opened (on November 15, 1982). The coefficient \n1\uf061 ,  measures  the  average  treatment  effect  of  the  Tohoku  and \n\nof  the  interaction  of  TJLi  and  Dt\n\n1982, \n\n\fHigh-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   17 \n\nJoetsu lines on local economic activities. \n\n1\uf061  has a negative sign if lower transport cost drives economic \nactivities  to  agglomerate  from  noncore  areas  toward  the  core,  Tokyo  MA  in  our  case.  By  contrast,  a \n1\uf061  indicates a dispersion effect. Note that Tokyo MA is automatically dropped from the data \nsample  as  it  is  covered  by  both  the  Tokaido  line  and  the  Tohoku/Joetsu  lines.  Hence,  the  DID \n\npositive \n\noperation will eliminate all observations in Tokyo MA. \n \n\ni\uf068\nIn this empirical model, we control for municipality and year fixed effects, represented by \n,  respectively.  We  acknowledge  that,  despite  the  control  of  year-specific  fixed  effects,  there \n\nand \n\nt\uf06d\n\ncould still be region specific unobserved time-varying factors, which can bias our estimates. We use a \nset  of  variables  Xit,  such  as  highway  investment,  to  control  for  some  time-varying  factors.  As  to  the \nremaining  unobserved  heterogeneity,  such  as  macroeconomic  shocks  or  policies,  they  would  be \neliminated  under  the  DID  framework  given  the  assumption  that  their  effects  are  similar  on  both  the \ncontrol  and  the  treatment  groups.  To  address  the  concern  that  this  assumption  may  be  violated  in \nreality,  we  shall  provide  additional  evidence  on  the  theory-based  hypotheses  discussed  in  section  II. \nOne implication is that the spatial impact of travel cost reduction depends on the distance between \nnoncore and the core areas (Figure 3). For a municipality along TJL, if it is far from Tokyo, its economy \nmay  shrink  as  the  service  sector  agglomerates  toward  Tokyo  MA.  By  contrast,  for  the  peripheral  of \nTokyo  MA,  its  economic  scale  may  grow,  as  the  spillover  from  the  Tokyo  MA  dominates  the \nagglomeration effect. Based on this theoretical implication, we propose the following specification by \naugmenting model (R.1) with the distance between a jurisdiction i and the core area Tokyo (DSTi): \n \n\nln(\n\nY\nit\n\n)\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf02b\n\uf062 \uf062\n1\n\n0\n\nln(\n\nDST\ni\n\n)\n\n\uf0b4\n\nTJL D\n\uf0b4\ni\nt\n\n1982\n\n\uf02b\n\nTJL D\n\uf0b4\n\uf062\ni\nt\n2\n\n1982\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf062\n3\n\nln(\n\nDST D\n)\ni\nt\n\n\uf0b4\n\n1982\n\n\uf02b \uf02b\ni\n\n\uf068 \uf06d \uf065\nt\nit\n\n\uf02b\n\n \n(R.2)\n\n.  \n\nThe main coefficient of interest is \n\n. We expect \n\n to have a negative sign, as the economic \n\n1\uf062\n\nscale of a municipality is more likely to be negatively impacted by the HSR if the municipality is further \n\naway from Tokyo. Moreover, we expect \n\n to be positive. In this case, the time-saving effect of TJL \n\n1\uf062\n\n2\uf062\n\nwill have a positive effect on the local economic scale if the municipality is sufficiently near to Tokyo \n\n(i.e., DST is small). \n \n\nAnother  implication  is  that  the  impact  of  HSR  differs  for  service  and  manufacturing  sectors: \nwhile  service  sector  agglomerate  toward  the  core  city  and  its  periphery,  manufacturing  sector  may \ndecentralize toward distant cities. We can test this hypothesis by applying model (R.2) to service and \nmanufacturing sectors, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\nV. \n\nEMPIRICAL EVIDENCE \n\nAgglomeration or Dispersion: Effect by Distance \n\n \nIn  this  section,  we  present  estimates  on  the  spatial  effects  of  HSR.  We  first  report  jurisdiction-level \nresults,  and  then  provide  evidence  by service  and  manufacturing  sectors.  Both  short-  and  long-term \neffects  are  shown  using  different  sample  periods.  In  all  regressions,  test  statistics  based  on  robust \nstandard errors clustered at the prefecture level are reported. \n \nA. \n \nIn theory, HSR can lead to either agglomeration or dispersion depending on the distance between the \nnoncore and the core areas. We start our empirical exercise by estimating the average effect of HSR on \nnoncore areas. \n \nAverage effect of HSR on noncore areas \n \nWe  first  estimate  model  (R.1)  for  the  average  effect  of  Tohoku  and  Joetsu  lines  (TJL)  on  residential \npopulation  in  noncore  municipalities.  It  is  reflected  by  the  coefficient  of  the  indicator  for  TJL \ncompletion in 1982 (Table 4). The estimate of this coefficient is negative and significant. Specifically, \nthe  estimates  imply  that  TJL  reduced  the  population  of  noncore  areas  by  5%  on  average,  consistent \nwith agglomeration toward the core area (column 1 of Table 4).  \n \n\nTable 4: Average Impact of TJL \n \n\n(1) \n\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\n(5) \n\n\u20130.05**\n(0.02) \n \n\n\u20130.21***\n(0.06) \n\n9.74***\n(0.02) \nN \n1980\u20132003\n22,624\n0.023\n\n9.73***\n(0.01) \nY\n1980\u20132003\n22,624\n0.132\n\n(3)\nln(pop)\n\n0.13**\n(0.05) \n14.63***\n(0.05) \nY\n1961\u20131982\n286\n0.750\n\n\u20130.15***\n(0.02) \n\n\u20130.03*** \n(0.01) \n \n\n9.48***\n(0.02) \nY\n1980\u20132003\n12,181\n0.162\n\n9.72*** \n(0.00) \nY \n1980\u20131985 \n5,636 \n0.227 \n\n \n \nTJL*(year>1982) \n\nTJL*(year>1971) \n\nConstant \n\nDetrend \nPeriod \nN \nR2 \n \n\nTJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines. \nNotes: Dependent variable is the logarithm of population at municipality (prefecture, for column 3) \nlevel.

We  need  to  distinguish  between  two  situations.  One  is  that  the  pre-existing  trends  are \nuncorrelated  with  the  expectations  of  TJL  completion.  If  this  is  the  case,  we  may  detrend  the \npopulation data by subtracting the pre-1982 time trends in both the treatment and the control groups \n\n\fHigh-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   19 \n\n(column 2).22 With this approach, the estimated effect of TJL on the population increases to 0.21. This \nestimate implies that approximately three million residents in treated regions have migrated to Tokyo \nMA due to TJL, increasing the population of Tokyo MA by 10.5% and accounting for 44% of Tokyo MA \npopulation increase from 1982 to 2003.23 \n \n\nAs another situation, the pre-existing migration trend of people might have been driven by the \nexpectation of TJL. With the ministerial approval of TJL construction in 1971, people in noncore areas \nalong TJL might expect population outflow and falling property prices. As a result, they could migrate \nto  the  core  city  even  before  the  line  was  completed.  To  address  this  concern,  we  reestimate  model \n(R.1)  using  prefecture  population  data,  which  cover  1961\u20131982  (data  are  detrended  using  data  of \n1950\u20131960).  Instead  of  using  1982  as  the  start  year  of  TJL,  we  use  1971,  the  year  of  approval.  This \nestimate  is  to  test  whether  the  population  agglomeration  to  Tokyo  MA  has  already  started  after  the \napproval  of  TJL  project.  The  estimated  coefficient  of  HSR  is  positive  (column  3),  contrasting  our \nprevious estimation. This is inconsistent with the hypothesized \u201capproval effect\u201d as discussed. \n\n \nIn column 4, we estimate the standard OLS model for comparison, without using the control \ngroup.  In  this  approach,  the  residential  population  is  estimated  to  decline  by  16%  due  to  the  TJL \noperation,  which  is  slightly  less  than  the  DID  estimate.  Therefore,  omitting  the  control  group  would \nbias our estimate of the TJL effect downward. \n\n \nPrevious estimates are for long-term effect over 2 decades following the completion of TJL. A \ntypical  concern  is  that  some  other  confounding  factors  arising  during  this  long  time  period  may  bias \nour  estimates,  such  as  the  housing  price  collapse.  To  address  this  concern,  we  conduct  a  series  of \nestimates  for  different  sample  time  periods.  We  find  that  the  effect  of  TJL  remained  negative  and \ngradually  strengthened  as  time  period  lengthens  (Figure  10).  To  illustrate,  column  5  reports  the \nestimate  for  1980\u20131985,  covering  3  years  after  the  completion  of  TJL.  The  average  impact  on  the \npopulation  was  estimated  to  be  one-seventh  of  the  estimate  during  1980\u20132003,  but  remains \nstatistically significant. \n \nEffects by Distance \n \nAn important implication of theory is that the effect of HSR on a noncore area varies by its distance to \nthe core area. When distance is long, HSR leads to agglomeration toward the core city; when distance \nis  short,  rising  urban  costs  due  to  congestion  effect  dominate  the  agglomeration  force,  leading  to \ndecentralization. \n \n\n                                                                 \n22   As the municipality-level data series have only 2 years of observations before 1982, we construct the pre-1982 trend by \nusing prefecture-level data. We first use the prefecture-level data from 1970 to 1980 to construct a (linear) projection of \nthe population growth rate during 1980\u20132003 for each prefecture. We then detrend the original municipality population \ndata by subtracting them by the prefecture-level population increase implied by pre-1982 trend. \n\n23   During 1982\u20132003, population size of Tokyo MA increased from 28.7 to 35.5 million. \n\n \n\n\f20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\nTo have a first-pass check of the hypothesis, we plot the municipality-level population growth \nrates  during  1982\u20132003  against  the  distances  between  municipalities  and  Tokyo  (Figure  9).  The \npopulation growth of municipalities in the treated group shows a negative relation with the distance to \nTokyo, while there is a flat (or slightly positive) relationship for the control group. Next we examine the \nrelationship  more  rigorously  by  estimating  model  (R.2)  using  detrended  municipality-level  data  for \n1980\u20132003.  The  coefficient  of  the  three-way  interaction  between  TJL,  the  D1982  indicators,  and  the \ndistance to Tokyo is \u20130.19, meaning that the negative effect of TJL on the population of a noncore city \nbecomes larger if it is further away from Tokyo (column 1 of Table 5). Together with the coefficient of \nthe interaction of the TJL and post-1982 indicators, 0.86, the model suggests that municipalities near \nTokyo  (within  92  km  (=e(0.86/0.19))  of  central  Tokyo)  experienced  a  population  increase  as  a \nconsequence of TJL. By contrast, the population of more distant municipalities shrank. This finding is \nconsistent  with  the  model  implication:  the  peripheral  of  the  core  area  may  benefit  from  its  spillover \nbecause of the rising urban costs in the core city. As a robustness check, we conduct a regression using \noriginal municipality data without detrending (column 2). The estimates are smaller in magnitude, but \nshow similar patterns to that of the previous regression. The implied \u201cboundary\u201d of the peripheral that \nbenefit from the spillover effect in Tokyo MA is approximately 130 km from central Tokyo. \n \n\nFigure 9: Population Growth in Treatment and Control \nMunicipalities (TJL versus TL) \n \n\nTJL population growth\n\nTL population growth\n\n)\n2\n8\n9\n1\n \n.\n\np\no\np\n(\nn\nl\n-\n)\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n \n.\n\np\no\np\n(\nn\n\nl\n\n1\n\n.5\n\n0\n\n\u2013.5\n\n\u20131\n\n)\n2\n8\n9\n1\n \n.\n\np\no\np\n(\nn\nl\n-\n)\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n \n.\n\np\no\np\n(\nn\n\nl\n\n1\n\n.5\n\n0\n\n\u2013.5\n\n\u20131\n\n \n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nDistance_Tokyo (km)\n\nDistance_Tokyo (km)\n\n \n\n \nkm = kilometer, TJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines, TL = Tokaido line. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\nAs shown in Figure 9, municipalities in the treatment group tend to be more remote to Tokyo. \nWe  estimate  (R.2)  using  municipalities  with  a  common  support,  namely,  with  similar  distances  to \nTokyo.

To test this implications, we group the population as the youth (<15 years old), the aged \n(>64 years old), and the working age (15\u201364 years old), and run the baseline regressions on each group \nseparately (Table 6). Consistent with the expectation, we find that the estimate for the working-age \npopulation is the most significant in terms of magnitude, doubling that for the full sample (column 1 of \nTable 6). The estimated gradient of agglomeration is also steeper for the working-age group (column 2 \nof Table 6). For the aged group, we find the HSR effects highly insignificant (columns 5\u20136 of Table 6). \nInterestingly,  for  the  youth,  we  find  smaller  but  qualitatively  similar  effects  as  the  working-age \npopulation (columns 3\u20134 of Table 6). This could be because children follow their parents when they \nmigrate, while the elderly stay behind. These findings by different age groups suggest that the patterns \nwe find are likely to be job related, but not due to the change of general living amenities. \n \n\nTable 6: Heterogeneity of the HSR Effects in Terms of Age \n \n(2)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(3)\n\n(1)\n\n \n \nTJL*(year>1982) \n\nTJL*(year>1982)*ln(DST) \n\nConstant \n\nN \nR2 \n\nln(pop): Age 15\u201364\n\u20130.10**\n(0.05) \n\n2.19***\n(0.57) \n\u20130.41***\n(0.10) \n9.22***\n(0.02) \n14,575\n0.107\n\nln(pop): Age <15\n1.28*\n\u20130.03\n(0.78) \n(0.02) \n\u20130.24*\n(0.14) \n8.14***\n(0.00) \n14,477\n0.729\n\n \n8.10***\n(0.01) \n14,477\n0.728\n\n \n9.20***\n(0.02) \n14,575\n0.091\n\n(6) \n\nln(pop): Age >64 \n\u20130.07 \n\u20130.01 \n(0.42) \n(0.03) \n0.01 \n(0.08) \n7.47*** \n(0.02) \n14,575 \n0.929 \n\n \n7.47*** \n(0.02) \n14,575 \n0.929 \n\nHSR = High-Speed Railroad, TJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines. \nNotes: Data are not detrended.

In this section, we test these implications \nusing  data  on  employment,  which  are  disaggregated  by  sector  and  municipality  levels.  Municipality \nlevel employment data are available only from 1980 to 2000 at a 5-year frequency. Therefore, we are \nnot  able  to  detrend  the  employment  data  as  we  do  for  population.  Nevertheless,  according  to  our \nfindings  earlier,  estimation  based  on  both  detrended  and  original  data  show  results  that  are \nqualitatively similar. \n \n\nWe first plot the change of service\u2013manufacturing employment ratio at the municipality level \nduring 1982\u20132003 against the distance between the municipalities and Tokyo for the treatment and \ncontrol groups, respectively (Figure 11). The patterns are consistent with our hypothesis: along the TJL \nline,  service/manufacturing  ratio  increases  in  municipalities  closer  to  Tokyo  but  decreases  in \nmunicipalities  that  are  further  away.  In  contrast,  this  pattern  does  not  appear  in  the  control  group. \nFormal  regression  results  are  presented  in  Table  7.  The  average  effect  of  HSR  on  service  sector \nis  consistent  with \nemployment  of  noncore  areas \nagglomeration  toward  Tokyo  (column  1).  In  contrast,  the  manufacturing  sector  decentralized  due  to \nHSR:  employment  in  the  manufacturing  sector  of  noncore  municipalities  is  estimated  to  increase  by \n21% after the opening of TJL (column 3). \n \n\nis  \u20137%  and  statistically  significant,  which \n\nFigure 11: Employment Growth in Treated and Control \nMunicipalities (TJL versus TL) \n \n\nTJL employment (serv/manu)\n\nTL employment (serv/manu)\n\n)\n)\n0\n8\n9\n1\n \n.\n\nu\nn\na\nm\n(\nn\nl\n-\n)\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n \n.\n\nu\nn\na\nm\n(\nn\nl\n(\n-\n)\n0\n8\n9\n1\n \n.\n\nv\nr\ne\ns\n(\nn\nl\n-\n)\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n \n.\n\nv\nr\ne\ns\n(\nn\n\nl\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n)\n)\n0\n8\n9\n1\n \n.\n\nu\nn\na\nm\n(\nn\nl\n-\n)\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n \n.\n\nu\nn\na\nm\n(\nn\nl\n(\n-\n)\n0\n8\n9\n1\n \n.\n\nv\nr\ne\ns\n(\nn\nl\n-\n)\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n \n.\n\nv\nr\ne\ns\n(\nn\n\nl\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n \n \n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nDistance_Tokyo (km)\n\nDistance_Tokyo (km)\n\n \n\n \nkm = kilometer, TJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines, TL = Tokaido line. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n\n\f24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\n \nTable 7: Impact of TJL by Service and Manufacturing Industries \n \n\n \n \nTJL*(year>1982) \n\nTJL*(year>1982)*ln(DST)\n\nConstant \n\nN \nR2 \n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4) \n\nln(service employ)\n0.72***\n\u20130.07**\n(0.18) \n(0.03) \n\u20130.14***\n(0.03) \n7.92***\n(0.01) \n4,714\n0.487\n\n \n7.92***\n(0.01) \n4,714\n0.472\n\nln(manu. employ) \n\u20130.99** \n0.19***\n(0.38) \n(0.05) \n0.21*** \n(0.07) \n7.35*** \n(0.02) \n4,714 \n0.198 \n\n \n7.35***\n(0.02) \n4,714\n0.188\n\nTJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines. \nNotes: Data is not detrended.

Dummy  variables \nindicating whether a municipality is within 60 km from an HSR station or greater than 60 km from an \nHSR  station  are  interacted  with  the  indicator  of  HSR  completion  and  TJL  dummy.  We  find  that \nmunicipalities within 60 km suffer the most from the impact of HSR, while municipalities that are 60 \nkm or further away from TJL show insignificant impact. \n \n\nThe control group of our baseline regressions includes prefectures along the Tokaido line. As a \nrobustness  check,  we  consider  an  alternative  control  group,  which  includes  jurisdictions  along  the \nHokuriku \nline,  connecting  three \nprefectures  in  the  western  region  to  Tokyo,  was  partly  operated  since  1997  with  a  length  of  117  km \n\nline  (Ishikawa,  Nagano,  and  Toyama  prefectures).

We  find  that  the  estimate  for  this \nsubsample of population is almost the same as that for the full sample (results are available upon request). \n\n\fHigh-Speed Railroad and Economic Geography: Evidence from Japan   |   25 \n\n(blue line in Figure 12[b]); the completed route is 345 km and has been in full operation since 2015.25 \nBoth the regions covered by the Hokuriku line (circled HL in Figure 12 [a]) and the Joetsu line (circled \nJL in Figure 12 [a]) are in inland Japan and are mountainous.26 Moreover, the Hokuriku line does not \ninvolve  large  cities,  which  could  affect  the  estimates.  The  disadvantage  is  that  Hokuriku  line  did  not \nopen until 1997. Hence, between 1982 and 1997, economic shocks to the Tokyo economy may have \ndifferent spillover effects on jurisdictions along the Joetsu line and the Hokuriku line. In this case, the \nDID approach is not able to eliminate these confounding spillover effects. \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Impact of Joetsu Line: Taking the Planned Hokuriku Line as the Control\n \n\n                                                     (a)                                                                                          (b) \n\n               \n\n \n\nNotes: Joetsu line (red line in Figure [b]); Hokuriku line (blue line in Figure [b]); In our robustness tests, we consider only the \npart of Joetsu line between Niigata and Takasaki as the treated area, because the Joetsu line overlaps with the Hokuriku line \nbetween Takasaki and Tokyo. \nSource: Constructed by the authors. \n\n \nFigure  13  presents  the  population  growth  dynamics  by  distance  to  Tokyo  during  1982\u20131996 \n(before the opening of the Hokuriku line in 1997), we find similar trends as those in the original treated \nand  control  groups.

First, given the size of Osaka, it could have significant economic linkage with \nits nearby areas. This is inconsistent with the setup of our model, in which we assume noncore areas \ntrade with Tokyo MA only. Second, the Sanyo line was completed in 1972 to extend the Tokaido line \nfrom  Osaka  toward  the  further  south  of  Japan  (Fukuoka).  Osaka  being  the  largest  city  on  this  line \ncould also experience the agglomeration from jurisdictions along the Sanyo line.  \n \n\n \n\n\f28   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\nTo  address  the  potential  confounding  effects  of  Osaka,  we  first  check  the  robustness  of  our \nestimates  by  excluding  Osaka  (Table  10).  The  estimates  are  generally  consistent  with  our  baseline \nresults.  Alternatively,  we  provide  direct  evidence  on  the  effect  of  the  Sanyo  line  on  Osaka.  The \nregression  is  similar  to  those  in  previous  exercises  (regression  models  R.1  and  R.2),  except  that  our \ntreatment group is now prefectures along the Sanyo line, while the control group is prefectures along \nthe  Tokaido  line  (excluding  Tokyo  MA  and  Osaka).  Our  sample  period  is  from  1960  to  2000 \n(prefecture level). \n \n\nWe find that the Sanyo line led to a population decline of 8% in non-Osaka areas (column 1 of \nTable 11); however, we do not find significant effect of the distance to Osaka (column 2). We also test \nwith  shorter  (1960\u20131980,  1960\u20131990)  time  periods  and  find  similar  results.27  These  findings  suggest \nthat the Sanyo line did induce a population loss in areas to the south of Osaka, although it is unclear \nwhether the lost population moved to Osaka. This could be because Osaka was not a core area, while \nTokyo was. This is in line with the descriptive evidence presented by Mori (2012): after the opening of \nthe Tokaido and Sanyo lines, Osaka MA shrunk because of greater agglomeration to Tokyo MA.  \n \n\nTable 10: Baseline Results: Excluding Osaka \n \n\n \n \nTJL*(year>1982) \n\nTJL*(year>1982)*ln(DST) \n\nConstant \n\nPeriod \nData frequency \nN \nR2 \n\n(1)\nln(pop)\n0.36**\n(0.15) \n\u20130.07***\n(0.03) \n9.62***\n(0.01) \n1980\u20132003\nannual\n21,042\n0.045\n\n(2)\nln(service employ)\n0.71***\n(0.23) \n\u20130.14***\n(0.04) \n7.78***\n(0.01) \n1980\u20132000\n5-year\n4,385\n0.487\n\n(3) \nln(manu. employ) \n\u20130.78* \n(0.47) \n0.17* \n(0.09) \n7.21*** \n(0.02) \n1980\u20132000 \n5-year \n4,385 \n0.196 \n\nTJL = Tohoku and Joetsu lines. \nNotes: Data are not detrended.

We first illustrate this utilizing \na core-periphery model, in which passengers can travel across regions to purchase service goods. As \nHSR reduces the interregional travel costs for passengers, the service sector with increasing returns to \nscale may agglomerate toward the core city if its distance with the noncore city is large; if the distance \nis  sufficiently  small,  HSR  leads  to  decentralization  of  the  service  sector.  The  impact  of  HSR  on  the \nmanufacturing sector may be the reverse, even though it is not directly affected by HSR. Specifically, \nwhen urban costs are present, HSR may push the manufacturing sector out of the core region toward \ndistant noncore areas. \n \n\nThese  hypotheses  are  supported  by  our  empirical  evidence  based  on  the  municipality  (or \nprefecture) residential and employment data from Japan. Utilizing the completion of HSR in Japan in \n1982  as  a  quasi-experiment,  we  conduct  DID  estimation  with  jurisdictions  along  new  HSR  as  a \ntreatment  group,  and  those  along  the  existing  HSR  as  a  control  group.  We  find  significant \nagglomeration of service industries toward Tokyo MA and its peripheral cities following the completion \nof  HSR.  Due  to  the  impact  of  the  new  HSR,  the  total  scale  of  Tokyo  MA  increased  by  as  much  as \n\n \n\n\f30   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 485 \n\n10.5%. The outskirt of Tokyo MA benefited even more than the Tokyo core. In contrast, manufacturing \nindustries  decentralize  toward  distant  noncore  areas.  These  effects  are  consistent  with  theory \nimplications. They persist in both short and long terms. \n\n \nThese findings reconcile contrasting findings in the literature: while some researchers find that \nHSR leads to agglomeration, some other show evidence on decentralization, depending on the sector \nand  spatial  scope  examined  by  researchers.  Moreover,  this  study  also  has  implications  regarding \ngrowth  strategies.  One  concerns  the  inclusive  growth.  A  common  hypothesis  by  governments \ninvesting in high-speed railroad is to help improve the growth of distant regions (e.g., DFT 2011, for the \nUK).  Although  HSR  may  improve  people\u2019s  mobility  and  choices  of  service  products,  we  find  no \nevidence that employment increases in distant areas. In fact, more distant noncore cities are likely to \nlose  jobs in the service sector, and this is  only partly offset by the decentralization  of manufacturing \nsector. Moreover, the urbanization strategy of developing countries may also be affected by HSR: the \nsurging  HSR  investments  may  generate  significant  economic  agglomeration  and  formation  of  mega \ncities due to further agglomeration in service industries. This can have profound implications for urban \npolicies  on  society,  demographics,  and  environment  in  the  face  of  the  rising  wave  of  high-speed \nrailroad investment around the globe, especially in developing countries. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nREFERENCES\uf02a \n\n \nAhlfeldt, G., and A.

We find that both agglomeration and decentralization  \ncould occur. While service industry tends to agglomerate toward the core city, manufacturing industry  \nmay decentralize toward peripheral cities. We estimate that in noncore areas of Japan, service employment  \ndecreased by 7%, while manufacturing employment increased by 21%. Moreover, proximity between  \nperipheral and core cities also matter. Cities within approximately 100 kilometers of Tokyo expanded, while  \nmore distant cities shrank. The net result is that Tokyo metropolitan area agglomerates because of HSR.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to the majority of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
