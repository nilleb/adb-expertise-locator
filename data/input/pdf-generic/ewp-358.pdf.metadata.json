There  are  more  and  more  intense \nnatural  disasters\u2014which  are  defined  to  cause  at  least  100  deaths  or  to  affect \nthe  basic  survival  needs  of  at  least  1,000  people\u2014resulting  from  floods  and \nstorms as well as droughts and heat waves. The Asia and the Pacific region has \nexperienced  some  of  the  most  damaging  disasters  in  recent  decades,  with \nalarming consequences for human welfare. At the same time, the climate in the \nregion  has  been  changing.  Temperatures  have  been  higher,  on  average,  and \nalso more variable and more extreme. Rainfall has also been more variable and \nmore extreme.  \n \nIs  there  a  relationship  between  these  changes  in  climate  and  the  increase  in \nnatural  disasters  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific?  This  paper  considers  three  main \nfactors\u2014rising  population  exposure,  greater  population \ndisaster \nvulnerability,  and  increasing  climate-related  hazards\u2014behind  the  increased \nfrequency of intense natural disasters. \n \nIn a regression analysis within a model of disaster risk determination, there is a \nsignificant  association  is  between  the  increase  in  natural  disasters  and \npopulation  exposure, \nrepresented  by  population  densities.  Population \nvulnerability  also  matters,  but  increasing  incomes  seem  to  be  associated  first \nwith  greater  and  then  lesser  vulnerability.  Finally,  there  is  a  significant \nassociation  between  climate-related  hazards  (greater  precipitation  linked  to \nfloods and storms and especially higher temperature linked to droughts and heat \nwaves)  and  the  frequency  of  intense  natural  disasters  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nand its subregions during 1971\u20132010. \n \nAlong  with  the  scientific  association  between  greenhouse  gases  and  the \nchanges in the climate, the findings in this paper suggest a connection between \nincreasing natural disasters in Asia and the Pacific and man-made emissions of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: natural disasters, intense disaster climate change, hazard, exposure, \nvulnerability, precipitation, temperature, tropical cyclone, typhoon, Philippines \n \nJEL classification: Q54, Q56, Q58, C23 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. INTRODUCTION \n \nThe  rising  frequency  of  intense  natural  disasters,  which  are  defined  as  those  causing  at  least \n100 deaths or affecting the basic survival needs (e.g., food, water, shelter, and sanitation) of at \nleast  1,000  people\u2014motivates  this  paper.  Recent  floods  and  storms  in  Australia,  India, \nIndonesia,  Pakistan,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand  have  wreaked  havoc.  Some  have  also \nshaken  up  regional  and  global  economies\u2014the  great  floods  of  2011  in  Thailand  cost  the \neconomy an estimated $45.5 billion (over 13% of gross domestic product [GDP]) in losses and \ndamages (World Bank 2012a). These disasters are threatening to erode the otherwise striking \nprogress in poverty reduction of recent decades in Asia and the Pacific.  \n\n \nIt  is  hydrometeorological  (e.g.,  floods,  storms)  and  climatological  disasters  (e.g., \ndroughts), rather than the geophysical disasters (e.g., earthquakes and volcanic eruptions), that \nhave been trending upwards in recent decades. This pattern suggests, but obviously does not \nprove,  a  possible  connection  with  man-made  climate  change.  This  possible  connection  has \nreceived widespread attention (Grinsted, Moore, and Jevrejeva 2013). Some research suggests \nthat  there  is  a  relationship  (United  Nations  International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Reduction \n[UNISDR]  2011,  World  Bank  2010).  Others  have  taken  the  view  (Economist  Intelligence  Unit \n[EIU]  2012)  that  only  the  damage  costs\u2014and  not  the  climate  hazards  themselves\u2014are  rising, \nlargely because of increasing populations and higher infrastructure costs, rather than because \nof climate change.  \n\n \nThis  paper  is  written  in  the  context  of  development  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific, 1 where \nnatural  disasters  play  a  visible  role  in  hindering  and  slowing  socioeconomic  progress \n(Maplecroft  2012,  Independent  Evaluation  Group  [IEG]  2006,  World  Bank  2011).  Disaster \nmanagement  involves  a  number  of  socioeconomic  and  climatic  factors.  Within  this  broad \ncontext, the paper examines the apparent contribution of climate factors to disaster trends. \n\n \nThis  paper  does  not  reexamine  the  causal  chain  from  greenhouse  emissions  to \natmospheric  concentrations,  to  changes  in  climate  variables  such  as  temperature  and \nprecipitation. There is a great deal of research on the science of climate change (Hansen and \nSato  2012;  Huber  and  Knutti  2012;  Knutson  et  al.  2010;  and  Trenberth  2011),  and  we  do  not \nseek  to  replicate  or  extend  it.  Rather,  the  paper  commences  with  the  observed  changes  in \nclimatic  variables  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and  then  explores  whether  there  is  a  statistical \nrelationship  between  these  changes  in  climate  variables  and  the  frequency  of  intense  natural \ndisasters.  \n\n \nThere  are  other  limitations  as  well.  A  large  body  of  research  has  been  conducted  on \ndisaster  management  (Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  [IPCC]  2012,  IEG  World \nBank 2006). But disaster management is not our focus. Nor does the paper examine the impact \nof  simultaneous  disasters  or  their  cumulative  effects,  such  as  floods  in  the  Philippines  or \ntsunamis in Japan, or the broader impact of disasters in other places, such as the fires in the \nRussian Federation in 2010 that pushed up international wheat prices.  \n\n \nThe paper is structured as follows. Section II sets out a framework for analysis, based on \nthe IPCC\u2019s disaster risk framework, focusing on the key idea that natural disaster risk is affected \nby hazards, exposure to those hazards, and vulnerability to their effects. Section III presents an \noverview of natural disaster data and trends globally, and in Asia and the Pacific. It notes that \nthe  overall  trend  of  increasing  disasters  is  largely  due  to  greater  frequency  of  intense \n\n                                                 \n1  \n\nIn this paper, Asia and the Pacific comprises all the economies of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific island nations.  \n\n\f2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\nhydrometeorological  events  (floods  and  storms),  rather  than  geophysical  events.  Section  IV \nuses  the  disaster  risk  framework  presented  in  Section  II  to  examine  how  the  risks  of  intense \nclimate-related  disasters  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  might  be  connected  to  demographic  factors, \nsocioeconomic and environmental degradation, and climate anomalies. Section V complements \nthe  regional  review  with  a  description  of  the  likely  impact  of  climate  and  disasters  in  the \nPhilippines. The final section presents some implications. \n\n \n\nDisaster Risk and Climate Change \n\n \nII. FRAMEWORK \n \nA great deal of work has gone before in understanding natural disasters and the contributors to \nthe  risk  of  their  occurrence.  We  bring  together  elements  of  the  literature  and  experience  that \nshed  light  on  the  disaster  phenomenon,  with  special  attention  to  the  role  climate  might  be \nplaying.  \n \nA. \n \nFigure 1 illustrates the framework used in this paper for examining climate-related disaster risks. \nThree  conceptual  links  would  need  to  be  established  to  show  a  relationship  between  human \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and natural disasters. First, it would need to be established \nthat GHG emissions (and hence increased atmospheric concentrations) affect climate variables \nsuch as average temperature and precipitation. Second, it must be established that there is a \nrelationship  between  average  temperatures  and  precipitation  and  the  emergence  of  climate-\nrelated  hazards.  Third,  it  must  be  established  that  an  increase  in  climate-related  hazards \naggravates natural disasters, either in their frequency or severity. \n\n \nThe first and second of these links are shown by the two solid arrows in Figure 1. The \nthird link could be established by teasing out the different contributions of the three elements of \nnatural disaster risk shown in the \u201cexposure\u2013vulnerability\u2013hazard\u201d model of the IPCC (2007 and \n2012). This model shows that population exposure and vulnerability together can turn a natural \nhazard into a natural disaster.2 Disaster risk is defined as the expected value of losses (deaths, \ninjuries, property, and others) that a hazard might cause.3 Disaster risk is therefore a function of \nthe three elements: (i) the hazard itself; (ii) the population exposed to the hazard; and (iii) the \ncommunity\u2019s ability to withstand its impact (vulnerability).  \n\n \nAre  observed  increases  in  temperature  and  precipitation  the  result  of  human  activities, \nparticularly the emissions of GHGs? A great deal of scientific research addresses this question, \nand  this  paper  does  not  provide  any  new  evidence;  instead  we  provide  a  brief  review  of  the \nexisting literature. Humans are emitting GHGs into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at a substantial and \nincreasing  rate\u2014currently  over  30  billion  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  per  annum  are  emitted \n(United States [US] Environmental Protection Agency 2010), along with a range of other GHGs, \nthe most important of which are methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (NO2). \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2  \n\nIPCC  (2012)  defines  exposure  as  the  presence  of  people,  livelihoods,  environmental  services  and  resources, \ninfrastructure,  or  economic,  social,  or  cultural  assets  in  places  that  could  be  adversely  affected.  It  defines \nvulnerability as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. \n\n3   Disaster  risk,  according  to  the  United  Nations  International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Reduction,  refers  to  \u201cpotential \ndisaster  losses,  in  lives,  health  status,  livelihoods,  assets  and  services,  which  could  occur  to  a  particular \ncommunity or a society over some specified future time period.\u201d See http://www.unisdr.org/we/inform/terminology  \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   3 \n\nFigure 1: Greenhouse Gases, Climate, and Disaster Risk \n \n\nGreenhouse\nGases\n\nTemperature\n\nPrecipitation\n\n\u201cclimate change\u201d\n\nIntense\nClimate-related\nHazards\n\nDisaster\nRisk\n\nExposure\n\nVulnerability\n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Adaptation of Figure SPM.1 in Intergovernmental Governmental Panel on Climate Change (2012). \n\n \n \nAs a result of these emissions, GHG concentrations in the atmosphere have also been \nrising consistently, as indicated by annual mean atmospheric CO2 emissions data measured by \nthe Scripps CO2 Program at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (Figure 2).  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2: Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Atmospheric Concentrations (ppm) \nMauna Loa Observatory (1971\u20132010) \n \n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n1970\n\nppm = parts per million. \n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n \n\nSource: CO2 stock data from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center. \n\n \n \nIncreased  concentrations  of  GHGs  in  the  atmosphere  would  be  expected  to  trap  more \nheat on Earth and lead to a gradual increase in global average temperatures. The IPCC (2007) \nconcluded that observed temperature increases of 0.76 degrees celcius (\u00b0C) over the last 150 \n\n\f4   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\nyears could not be attributed solely to natural variability; human-induced GHG emissions are a \nkey driver of temperature increases.4  \n\n \nFinally,  as  average  temperatures  rise,  average  rainfall  would  be  expected  to  increase. \nPrecipitation  is  a  local  phenomenon,  however,  and  is  highly  variable  both  spatially  and \ntemporally.  The  IPCC  (2007)  notes  that  overall,  \u201clong-term  trends  [in  precipitation]  have  not \nbeen observed\u201d in some regions, while at the same time there have been \u201cstatistically significant \ntrends in the number of heavy [or extreme] precipitation events\u201d in other regions, especially over \nthe second half of the 20th century. \n \nB. \n \nTo connect GHG emissions with natural disasters, it is not enough to show that the increase in \nconcentrations  of  GHGs  in  the  Earth\u2019s  atmosphere  has  led  to  increased  temperature  or \nprecipitation. A relationship between GHGs and climate-related hazards\u2014extreme temperatures \nand precipitation\u2014is required. Do GHG emissions also lead to increased climate hazards in the \nform of extreme precipitation and temperatures?  \n\nExtreme Temperatures and Precipitation \n\n \nA  special  report  of  the  IPCC  (2012)  was  rightly  cautious  in  its  conclusions  about  the \nrelationship  between  climate  change  and  extreme  events,  stating  that  \u201clong-term  trends  in \neconomic disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed \nto climate change, but a role for climate change has not been excluded.\" While there is yet to be \nany evidence of any long-term relationship between GHGs and average precipitation, however, \na  recent  worldwide  review  of  global  rainfall  data  by  Westra,  Alexander,  and  Zwiers  (2012), \nconcludes that \u201crainfall extremes are increasing on average globally.\u201d Their study indicates that \nthis trend is strongly related with rising global atmospheric temperature. Specifically, they found \nthat \u201cthere is a 7% increase in extreme rainfall intensity for every degree [centigrade] increase in \nglobal  atmospheric  temperature.\u201d  Other  research  has  found  that  the  increased  occurrence  of \nextreme  precipitation  is  causally  related  to  anthropogenic  GHG  emissions  (O'Gorman  and \nSchneider  2009,  Min  et  al.  2011). 5  Extreme  precipitation  has  also  been  causally  linked  to \nchanges in global temperature (Lenderink and van Meijgaard 2010, Trenberth 2011).6  \n\n \nResearch  in  the  area  of  climate-related  disasters  can  be  controversial.  Very  recently, \nSander  et  al.  (2013)  argued  that  there  is  a  relationship  between  climate  change  and \nthunderstorms  in  the  US,  although  they  note  that  final  attribution  is  not    possible.  The \nhypothesized  causal  mechanism  is  that  increased  temperatures  lead  to  increased  humidity, \ngreater  thunderstorm  variability,  and  hence,  greater  losses.  However,  Pielke  (2013)  observes \nthat  humidity  has  not  increased  over  the  relevant  period  (1973\u20131999)  in  the  area  where  most \nUS thunderstorm activity and damage has occurred.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4   Section  9  of  the  IPCC\u2019s  4th  Assessment  Report  on  the  \u201cPhysical  Science  Basis\u201d  discusses  various  Bayesian \nstatistical methods of analysis, such as \u201coptimal fingerprinting\u201d, for detecting the effects of GHG emissions. Earlier \nefforts  were  made  to  detect  GHG-induced  climate  change  statistically  (Hasselmann  et  al.  1993,  Hegerl  et  al. \n1996). \n\n5   More generally, the impacts of climate change, and how human factors influence these impacts, have also been \ndiscussed  in  Schreider,  Smith,  and  Jakeman  (2000);  Haines  et  al.  (2006);  McGranahan,  Balk,  and  Anderson \n(2007); Kundzewicz et al. (2008); and the World Bank (2010, 2012b). \n\n6   An  example  of  the  natural  variability  of  the  climate  system  is  the  fluctuation  of  sea  surface  temperatures  in  the \ntropical eastern Pacific, called the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The extremes of the ENSO pattern\u2014El \nNi\u00f1o  (warming)  and  La  Ni\u00f1a  (cooling)\u2014cause  extreme  weather  (such  as  floods  and  droughts)  in  many  world \nregions. The warm phase typically accompanies high air surface pressure in the western Pacific. Through ENSO, \noceans store and release heat, and therefore also influence measured global surface temperatures. \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   5 \n\nPast research has estimated the impact of climate change on the probability of particular \nhazards,  such  as  the  2003  European  heat  wave  (Stott,  Stone,  and  Allen  2004),  the  2010 \nMoscow  heat  wave  (Rahmstorf  and  Coumou  2011),  and  droughts  in  the  Mediterranean  areas \n(Hoerling  et  al.  2012).  Stott,  Stone,  and  Allen  (2004)  found  that  it  is  very  likely  that  human \ninfluence has at least doubled the risk of a heat wave exceeding a mean summer temperature \nthreshold magnitude which is below the temperature recorded during the 2003 European heat \nwave.  Similarly,  Rahmstorf  and  Coumou  (2011)  found  that  human-induced  climate  change \nwould be expected to have increased the likelihood of the 2010 Moscow heat wave.  \n\n \nHoerling et al. (2012) found that half the magnitude of increased wintertime droughts in \nthe  Mediterranean  can  be  attributed  to  anthropogenic  GHG  and  aerosol  forcing.  Pall  et  al. \n(2011) also estimated the contribution of GHG emissions to flood risks in England and Wales, \nwhere they found that human-induced emissions in the 20th century increased the risk of floods \nby more than 20% in nine out of ten cases and, by more than 90% in two out of three cases. \nThe  findings  of  this  climate  research  point  to  the  same  conclusion:  the  overall  frequency  of \nvarious extreme events will continue to rise. \n\n \nData for Asia and the Pacific also present certain trends. Temperature anomalies during \nthe  months  when  these  intense  disasters  occur  are  increasing.  Precipitation  deviations  from \nnormal during the months when these events occur also appear to change in distribution across \ndecades  (Figure  3),  with  tests  for  homogeneity  of  variance  indicating  highly  significant \nheterogeneity. Average monthly temperature anomalies recorded during climatological disasters \n(droughts) in Asia and the Pacific appear to have shifted distribution over the last few decades \n(see Figure 3a).  \n \n\nFigure 3: Distribution of Mean Temperature Anomalies and Average Deviations from \nNormal during Months of Hydrometeorological Disasters in Asia and the Pacific \n \n\n(a) Average Monthly Temperature Anomalies\n\n1971\u20131980\n\n1981\u20131990\n\n1991\u20132000\n\n2001\u20132010\n\ny\nc\nn\ne\nu\nq\ne\nr\nF\n\ny\nc\nn\ne\nu\nq\ne\nr\nF\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4 \u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4 \u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4 \u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(b) Average Monthly Precipitation Deviations from Normal\n\n1971\u20131980\n\n1981\u20131990\n\n1991\u20132000\n\n2001\u20132010\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600 0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600 0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n \n\nSource: Result of merging hydrometeorological disaster data from EM-DAT with monthly temperature anomalies from the Climate \nResearch Unit\u2019s HADCRUT3 database (2012), and monthly precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre \n(2011). \n\n\f6   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\nHazards, Exposure, and Vulnerability \n\nOverall, there is a growing suggestion of a connection between human GHG emissions \nand  the  increase  in  extreme  temperatures  and  precipitation,  or  \u201cclimate-related\u201d  hazards. \nHowever,  this  evidence  does  not  necessarily  imply  that  there  is  a  causal  connection  between \nclimate change and an increase in natural disasters. In order to examine this issue in the Asia \nand Pacific context, this paper returns to the framework in Figure 1 to disentangle the effects of \nincreases in hazard from increases in exposure and vulnerability. \n \nC. \n \nThe  framework  outlined  in  Figure  1  is  particularly  helpful  in  identifying  the  separate  drivers  of \nnatural disaster risk in a mutually exclusive and multiplicative fashion. For instance, a climate-\nrelated hazard, such as heavy rain or drought, might not create a natural disaster if people are \nnot exposed (e.g., are not present in the area) where the hazard strikes. A moderate storm in a \ndensely populated city may pose greater risk than an intense storm in a remote farm area. And \nthere  is  no  disaster  if  all  the  people  exposed  can  immediately  bounce  back  or  use  backup \nsystems to return to business as usual. We consider each of these three elements of disaster \nrisk\u2014vulnerability, exposure, and hazards\u2014in turn. \n\n \nThe concept of \u201cvulnerability\u201d to a hazard has several dimensions, including economic, \nsocial, cultural, environmental, and psychological.7 Vulnerability is a function of wealth and other \ndemographic and socioeconomic factors. The poor, who often have less adaptive capacity, are \nfrequently  more  vulnerable  to  climate-related  hazards  (Kim  2012,  Carter  et  al.  2007).  As  an \nAustralian folk song has it: \u201cBare legged Kate, when the floods come down, it's the poor on the \ncreeks are the ones who drown.\u201d The poor are more vulnerable due to lack of information, skills, \ntechnology,  infrastructure,  and  social  capital.  Flash  floods  commonly  cause  more  fatalities  in \npoorer communities than those better off. And when people living in risk-prone areas depend on \ntheir  livelihoods  on  activities  directly  affected  by  such  hazards,  it  can  amplify  the  disaster  risk \nand damage (IEG World Bank 2006).  \n\n \nExposure is a more straightforward notion. It covers both the direct effects (e.g., property \ndamage  or  death)  and  the  indirect  effects  (e.g.,  increase  in  food  prices)  from  a  hazard. \nExposure is increasing as more and more people in Asia and the Pacific locate themselves in \nhazardous  areas  such  as  booming  megacities,  on  deltas,  or  along  coastlines  and  rivers \n(UNISDR  2012,  Kim  2012).  Entire  new  settlements  may  be  built  in  harm\u2019s  way,  where  even \nbasic  infrastructure  is  lacking,  and  disaster  management  may  not  seem  urgent  until  the  next \nlethal event occurs. \n\n \nVulnerability  and  exposure  are  distinct  concepts.  People  may  be  exposed  to  disasters \nbecause they reside in hazard-prone areas, but with high adaptive capacity they may have low \nvulnerability.  Conversely,  others  may  not  reside  in  hazard-prone  areas,  but  may  still  be \nvulnerable to the direct or indirect effect (e.g., on prices) of a particular event. The concepts of \nvulnerability and exposure (to a lesser extent) are also related to concepts of climate resilience \nand adaptive capacity. Resilience refers to the ability of people to bounce back to pre-disaster \nconditions after a disaster. Adaptive capacity refers to the maintenance of certain structures and \nfunctions despite disturbances caused by a disaster. Both resilience and adaptive capacity help \npeople to plan for, cope with, resist, and recover from disaster losses.  \n\n                                                 \n7   There are varying models and frameworks of vulnerability (see Cutter et al. 2009). While these dimensions can \nbe  contextual,  there  are  also  common  elements  across  time,  space,  and  scale.  See  Kelly  and  Adger  2000, \nTurner II et al. 2003, Thomalla et al. 2006, F\u00fcssel and Klein 2006, Smith and Wandel 2006, O\u2019Brien et al. 2007, \nand Internal Disaster Monitoring Centre 2009. \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   7 \n\nFinally,  without  a  natural  hazard  in  the  first  place,  there  would  be  no  natural  disaster.8 \nNatural hazards include climate-related hazards, namely extreme precipitation (causing storms \nand  floods)  and  extreme  temperatures  (and  thus  droughts,  wildfires,  or  heat  waves).  Basic \natmospheric  physics  suggests  that  there  is  a  connection  between  these  two  hazards.  If  the \ntemperature rises, the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases, which can indeed \nresult in increased water content in the atmosphere, and may lead to increased precipitation.  \n\n \nAs  noted  above,  there  are  data  and  growing  analytical  evidence  to  support  both  the \nexistence  of  the  climate-related  hazards  of  higher  temperatures  and  precipitation,  and  their \nconnection with  GHG  emissions.  Given  the  increase  in  climate-related hazards,  exposure  and \nvulnerability, the observed increase in natural disasters would be expected. The key challenge \nis  determining  the  relative  contributions  of  the  three  drivers,  which  this  paper  attempts  in \nSection IV. Prior to that, in Section III we review data and trends concerning natural disasters.  \n \n \nIII. NATURAL DISASTER CLASSIFICATIONS AND TRENDS \n \nReports indicate a significant rise in the frequency of natural disasters over the past 2 decades \n(Jennings 2011, Guha-Sapir 2011, Munich Re 2012, Hoeppe 2007, and IEG World Bank 2006). \nMany  of  these  reports  use  disaster  information  sourced  from  the  Emergency  Event  Database \n(EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), which is widely \nconsidered the most comprehensive, publicly available database on natural disasters.9  \n\n \nThe EM-DAT classifies natural disasters into five disaster subgroups: \n \na. \nb. \nc. \nd. \ne. \n \nIn  this  paper,  climate-related  disasters  comprise  meteorological,  hydrological,  and \n\ngeophysical (earthquakes, volcanoes, and dry mass movements),  \nmeteorological (storms),  \nhydrological (floods and wet mass movements), \nclimatological (extreme temperature changes, such as drought and wildfire), and  \nbiological (epidemics, insect infestations, and animal stampedes).  \n\nclimatological subgroups. \n\n \nImproved  disaster  reporting  arising  out  of  better  information  and  communications \ntechnology  can  affect  data  on  disaster  events  and  their  costs.  A  more  extreme  view \n(Kirschenbaum  2004)  even  suggests  that  some  of  the  increase  in  events  results  from  the \nwidespread  establishment  of  disaster  management  agencies,  which  dramatize  mere  incidents \ninto full-fledged disasters.  \n\n \nJennings  (2011)  and  Thomas  (2011)  examined  the  trends  in  the  frequency  of  natural \ndisasters  as reported in  EM-DAT  and  suggest  that  even  after  the figures  on the  frequency  of \ndisasters are  adjusted  for  reporting  biases,  and rising  population, the  rise in the frequency  of \nnatural disasters is notable.  \n\n                                                 \n8   Disasters  are  conventionally  categorized  as  either  natural  or  man-made.  For  instance,  insurance  determines \nwhether  a  disaster  is  an  \u201cact  of  God  or  man.\u201d  Strictly  speaking,  however,  all  disasters  can  be  associated  with \nhuman  actions  or  inaction  to  some  degree.  For  instance,  if  humans  take  wise  or  effective  action  in  confronting \nknown hazards, hazards need not develop into disasters. \n\n9   CRED  defines  disaster  as  \u201ca  situation  or  event  which  overwhelms  local  capacity,  necessitating  a  request  to  a \nnational  or  international  level  for  external  assistance;  an  unforeseen  and  often  sudden  event  that  causes  great \ndamage, destruction and human suffering.\u201d \n\n\f8   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\nThe  examination  of  EM-DAT  natural  disasters  here  is  restricted  to  relatively  intense \nnatural  disasters,  that  is,  those  that  killed  100  or  more  people  or  affected10 1,000  or  more.11 \nThese are in any case likely to be better recorded and reported than the less intense disasters. \nAlso,  most  attention  is given  here  to  EM-DAT  data  on  intense  natural  disasters starting  in  the \n1970s, given the more limited information prior to this period.  \n \nA. \n \nThe  frequency  of  intense  natural  disasters  generally  increased  during  1971\u20132010  (Figure  2), \nincreasing almost fourfold from 1971\u20131980 to 2001\u20132010. And hydro-meteorological disasters, \ntwo-thirds  of  the  total  frequency  of  intense  natural  disasters  from  1971\u20132010,  accounted  for \n70% of the total increase from 1971\u20131980 to 2001\u20132010. \n\nFrequency of Natural Disasters \n\n \n \nFigure 2: Global Frequency of Intense Natural Disasters by Type (1971\u20132010) \n \n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n1971 1974 1977 1980 1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 2010\n\nGeophysical\nHydrological\nBiological\n\nMeteorological\nClimatological\n\n \nNote: Intense natural disasters are disaster events that caused 100 or more deaths or affected 1,000 or more people.  \n\nSource: Frequencies are authors\u2019 estimates based on data from the Emergency Event Database of the Centre for Research on the \nEpidemiology of Disasters. http://www.emdat.be (accessed 6 December 2011). \n\n \n \nThis broad pattern also holds for Asia and the Pacific, which accounted for around half of \nthe  global  frequency  of  intense  natural  disasters  during  1971\u20132010  and  the  increase  between \n1971\u20131980  and  2001\u20132010.  Intense  hydrometeorological  disasters  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific, \nwhich  accounted  for  72%  of  the  frequency  of  intense  natural  disasters  recorded  during  1971\u2013\n2010  in  the  region,  represented  more  than  half  of  the  increase  in  frequency  of  intense \nhydrometeorological disasters recorded globally from 1971\u20131980 to 2001\u20132010. \n                                                 \n10   People affected are those requiring immediate assistance (i.e., basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, \n\nsanitation, and immediate medical assistance). \n\n11   IPCC  (2012)  examines  climate  extremes,  defined  as  the  occurrence  of  a  value  of  a  weather  or  climate  variable \nabove (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed values of the variable. \nThese climate extremes are not necessarily equivalent to intense climate-related natural disasters, which are also \na function of the number of human fatalities and people displaced.  \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   9 \n\nDamage from Natural Disasters \n\nThe  frequency  of  intense  hydrometeorological  disasters  is  also  on  the  rise  in  the \nPhilippines,  which  sits  in  the  typhoon  belt.  Hydrometeorological  events  accounted  for  most \n(86%) of the intense natural disasters in the country during 1971\u20132010. The frequency of these \ndisasters more than doubled from 1971\u20131980 to 2001\u20132010, fully accounting for the total rise in \nfrequency of intense natural disasters recorded in the country. \n \nB. \n \nIn  general,  the  damage  inflicted  by  a  given  natural  disaster  is  also  increasing  alongside \nfrequency.  The  frequency  of  people  \u201caffected\u201d  or  \u201ctemporarily  displaced\u201d  by  intense  disasters \nper year increased to 234 million people per year in 2001\u20132010, up by 76.5% from 1971 to 1980 \n(Table  1).  Two-thirds  of  this  increase  is  due  to  the  rise  in  people  affected  by  intense \nhydrometeorological disasters.  \n \n\nOf the total increase in the number of people affected by intense disasters from 1971\u2013\n1980 to 2001\u20132010, 90% is in Asia and the Pacific. The region also accounted for over half of \nthe 3 million lives lost to intense disasters during 1971\u20132010, as well as half of the increase in \nthe global number of deaths from 1971\u20131980 to 2001\u20132010. The majority of people affected by \n(95.8%) and deaths due to intense disasters (91.5%) in the region during 1971\u20132010 are in low- \nand lower-middle-income countries.  \n\n \n \nTable 1: Global Average Annual Number of People Affected by Intense Disasters \n(million) \n \n\nGeophysical \n\nMeteorological\n\nHydrological\n\nClimatological \n\nBiological\n\nPeriod \nBy 10-Year Period \n    1971\u20131980 \n    1981\u20131990 \n    1991\u20132000 \n    2001\u20132010 \n1971\u20132010 \n\n15.4 \n34.6 \n26.6 \n88.5 \n41.3 \n\n  65.9 \n139.8 \n221.9 \n390.8 \n204.6 \n\n225.0 \n473.4 \n     1,466.0 \n     1,066.8 \n807.8 \n\n278.8 \n596.9 \n372.5 \n784.9 \n508.3 \n\n2.3 \n1.7 \n      14.5 \n5.0 \n5.9 \n\nNote: People affected are those requiring immediate assistance (i.e., basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, sanitation, \nand immediate medical assistance) during an emergency.  \n\nSource:  Emergency Event Database, Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. http://www.emdat.be (accessed \n6 December 2011). \n \n \nAlthough  this  paper  focuses  on  the  number  of  people  affected  by  intense  natural \ndisasters,  it  has  been  widely  remarked  that  the  value  of  damages  has  also  increased  sharply \nfrom 1971\u20131980 to 2001\u20132010.12 Over 70% of this increase is due to intense storms and floods, \nwhile intense geophysical events accounted for 22% and climatological disasters for 7% of the \nincrease.  Geographically,  Asia  and  the  Pacific  accounted  for  half  of  the  increase  in  damage \nworldwide. \n\n \nEach  type  of  disaster  impacts  life  and  property  differently.  Earthquakes  can  be  deadly \nand  have  severe  economic  costs,  and  geophysical  disasters  (including  earthquakes)  are \nresponsible  for  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  casualties.  The  devastating  earthquake  and \ntsunami in Japan in 2011 killed more than 15,000 people, with estimated damages ranging from \n                                                 \n12   EM-DAT\u2019s data on disaster damage costs (in nominal US dollars) reflect the direct and indirect consequences of a \ndisaster on the economy.

ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF DISASTER RISK FACTORS \n \nWe  now  examine  the  role  played  by  the  three  principal  elements  of  natural  disaster  risk.  We \ndefine  disaster  risk  as  the  expected  impact,  in  number  of  deaths  or  people  affected  (i.e., \nrequiring  immediate  assistance  with  basic  survival  needs  such  as  food,  water,  shelter, \nsanitation,  or  medical  assistance)  during  an  emergency,  of  natural  disasters  in  a  given  future \nperiod.  There  are  other  definitions.  For  instance,  much  research  defines  disaster  risk  as  the \nprobable  level  of  damages  in  US  dollars,  based  on  historical  data.  However,  measuring  the \nimpact  of  natural  disaster  in  monetary  terms  involves  a  number  of  data  issues,  chiefly \nregarding  accuracy,  because  of  the  lack  of  standards  for  comparable  estimation  across \neconomies or across disasters within an economy.  \n\n \nThe frequency of intense climate-related disasters is higher in Asia and the Pacific than \nother  regions  (World  Bank  2010,  IFRC  2010).  Similarly,  the  magnitude  of  intense,  climate-\nrelated  disasters  is  also  highest  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  According  to  EM-DAT  data, \nBangladesh,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India,  Myanmar,  the  Philippines,  and  Viet  Nam \nare at exceptional risk (see Figures 11 and 12 in Thomas, Albert, and Perez 2012). \n \nA. \n \nThis  paper  uses  the  framework  in  Figure  1  to  identify  the  role  of  population  exposure, \nvulnerability, and climate-related hazards in explaining the rising frequency of intense climate-\nrelated disasters in Asia and the Pacific.13 The dependent variables in the analysis, (cid:1834)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) and (cid:1829)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), \nare the annual frequencies of intense hydrometeorological and climatological natural disasters \nthat killed 100 or more people or affected 1,000 or more in country (cid:1861) in year (cid:1872), respectively. Data \nare obtained for 1970\u20132010 from EM-DAT. \n\nData and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n13   Only natural disaster observations reported in EM-DAT with information on either the number of people affected or \nkilled  are  counted;  those  with  missing  information  on  both  indicators  are  not  counted.  EM-DAT  provides \ninformation on the total number of people affected or killed per disaster only. As such, for observations involving \nmulti-year disasters or disasters that occur in a country and last for over a year, we use the information on total \nnumber  of  people  affected  or  killed  per  disaster  as  follows:    a  disaster  that  affected  2,000  people  in  2  years \n(1995\u20131996) is considered as an intense disaster in both years. Meanwhile, if the disaster affected only a total of \n1,500  people,  it  is  considered  an  intense  disaster  in  1995,  but  not  in  1996.  Finally,  for  years  with  no  disaster \nobservations  reported  in  EM-DAT,  the  number  of  disasters  is  set  to  zero.

The  Poisson  model  was \nemployed  for  climatological  natural  disasters,  (cid:1829)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) ,  because  the  necessary  equidispersion \nassumption  was  satisfied  (i.e.,  the  mean  of  the  count  variable  is  equal  to  its  variance).  For \nhydrometeorological  natural  disasters, (cid:1834)(cid:3036)(cid:3047),  likelihood  ratio  tests  indicated  overdispersion,15 so \nthe  negative  binomial  regression  was  more  appropriate. 16  Specifically,  we  estimated  the \nfollowing equations with random and country fixed-effects17: \n\n \n\n \n\n(cid:1831)(cid:4670)(cid:1834)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)| (cid:1847)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1848)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1849)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)(cid:4671) (cid:3404) exp(cid:4666)(cid:2010)(cid:2868) (cid:3397) (cid:2010)(cid:2869)(cid:1847)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) (cid:3397) (cid:2010)(cid:2870)(cid:1848)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) (cid:3397)   (cid:2010)(cid:2871)(cid:1849)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) (cid:3397)   (cid:2010)(cid:2872)(cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)(cid:4667) exp (cid:4666)(cid:2013)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)(cid:4667) \n\n(cid:1831)(cid:4670)(cid:1829)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)| (cid:1847)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1848)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1849)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1852)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)(cid:4671) (cid:3404) exp (cid:4666)(cid:2010)(cid:2868) (cid:3397) (cid:2010)(cid:2869)(cid:1847)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) (cid:3397) (cid:2010)(cid:2870)(cid:1848)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) (cid:3397)   (cid:2010)(cid:2871)(cid:1849)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) (cid:3397)   (cid:2010)(cid:2872)(cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) (cid:3397)   (cid:2010)(cid:2873)(cid:1852)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)(cid:4667)  \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n \nThe explanatory variables (cid:4666)(cid:1847)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1848)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1849)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3047), (cid:1852)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)(cid:4667) are: \n \na. \nb. \nc. \n\npopulation exposure (cid:4666)(cid:1847)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)) or the degree to which people are in harm\u2019s way; \nvulnerability (cid:4666)(cid:1848)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)) or the population\u2019s capability to address the problem; and  \nthe climate-related hazard, specifically water-related anomalies or deviation from \nthe mean (cid:4666)(cid:1849)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)) and temperature anomalies or deviation from the mean (cid:4666)(cid:1852)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)) in a \ngiven  year.  While  equation  (2)  incorporates  temperature  as  an  independent \nvariable,  equation  (1)  does  not,  reflecting  the  assumption  that  temperature  is \nmore  directly  related  to  climatological  disasters  than  hydrometeorological \ndisasters.  \n\n \nThe regression also includes total population per country (cid:4666)(cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)(cid:4667) in the relevant year as a \ncontrol  variable.  Even  though  population  density  is  already  included  as  an  independent \nvariable, this may not pick up the possibility that frequency of natural disasters surpassing the \n\u201cintense\u201d reporting threshold (i.e., at least 100 deaths or at least 1,000 people affected due to a \n\n                                                 \n14   A summary of the descriptive statistics for the variables used in the regressions is provided in Appendix Table 1. \nEconomies in the sample include (East Asia, seven economies) Hong Kong, China; Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea; Japan; Macao, China; Mongolia; People\u2019s Republic of China; and the Republic of Korea; (South Asia, \neight economies) Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka; (Southeast Asia, \n11  economies)  Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia, \nMyanmar,  the  Philippines,  Singapore,  Thailand,  Timor-Leste,  and  Viet  Nam;  (Central  Asia,  22  economies) \nArmenia,  Azerbaijan,  Bahrain,  Cyprus,  Georgia,  Iraq,  Israel,  Jordan,  Kazakhstan,  Kuwait,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nLebanon,  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory,  Oman,  Qatar,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syrian  Arab  Republic,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan,  United  Arab  Emirates,  Uzbekistan,  Yemen;  (the  Pacific  Asia,  eight  economies)  Australia,  Fiji, \nKiribati, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. \n\n15   In our dataset, the Likelihood ratio (LR) tests reject the hypothesis that coefficient of dispersion ((cid:2009)) is equal to zero \n(Ho: (cid:2009) =  0)  at  1%  level  of  significance  in  all  specifications  involving  intense  hydrometeorological  disasters  (see \nbottom row of Table 2), but not in those that involve climatological disasters. \n\n16   The  standard  negative  binomial  regression  is  derived  from  the  Poisson  model  by  adding  an  independently \ndistributed error term (\u03b5). It allows the mean to differ from the variance of the count variable such that variability of \n(cid:1851)  is  assumed  to  be  equal  to  the  mean:  (cid:1848)(cid:1853)(cid:1870)(cid:4666)(cid:1851)|(cid:1850)(cid:4667) (cid:3404)   (cid:1831)(cid:4666)(cid:1851)|(cid:1850)(cid:4667)(cid:4670)1 (cid:3397) (cid:2009)(cid:1831)(cid:4666)(cid:1851)|(cid:1850)(cid:4667)(cid:4671)  where  (cid:1831)(cid:4666)(cid:1851)|(cid:1850)(cid:4667) (cid:3404)  exp (cid:4666)(cid:2010)(cid:2868) (cid:3397) (cid:2010)(cid:2869) (cid:1850)(cid:2869) (cid:3397)\n(cid:2010)(cid:2870)(cid:1850)(cid:2870) (cid:3397)   (cid:1710) (cid:3397)   (cid:2010)(cid:3038)(cid:1850)(cid:3038)(cid:4667)  and  (cid:2009)  is  a  measure  of  dispersion.  When  (cid:2009)  is  not  significantly  greater  from  zero  (i.e.,  no \noverdispersion),  the  negative  binomial  model  reduces  to  the  Poisson  model.  The  negative  binomial  regression \nmodel is more efficient when (cid:2009) is significantly different from zero (i.e., the count outcome data is over dispersed).  \n17   Fixed-effects negative binomial panel regression models can be estimated as either unconditional (all parameters \nestimated)  or  as  conditional  (the  estimation  is  conditional  on  the  value  of  a  sufficient  statistic  for  one  or  more \nparameters).  However,  the  conditional  fixed  effects  model  is  not  a  true  fixed  effects  model  because  it  does  not \ncontrol for unchanging covariates or the variables that are possibly predictive of the outcome under study (Allison \nand Waterman 2002). Hence, this paper uses an unconditional fixed effects negative binomial regression. For a \nmore  detailed  discussion  on  the  negative  binomial  panel  regression  model  see  Hilbe  (2011),  Baum  (2006),  or \nHamilton (1994). \n\n\f12   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\nnatural  disaster)  would  be  higher  when  the  overall  population  increases.  The  term  ( (cid:2013)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) ) \nrepresents the error from unobserved heterogeneity.  \n\n \nPopulation  exposure  ((cid:1847)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)),  is  measured  by  the  logarithm  of  population  density  (people \nper  square  kilometer)  per  country. 18  This  follows  studies  such  as  Birkmann  (2007)  and \nTaubenbock  et  al.  (2008),  which  suggest  population  density  as  a  demographic  vulnerability \nmeasure. However, this is only a proxy for the actual population exposed to any given natural \nhazard in a particular country. One limitation of using national population density is that it does \nnot  account  for  distribution  of  people  within  the  country.  For  instance,  a  country  with  densely \npopulated  coastal  areas  might  have  low  national  density  because  of  the  presence  of  large \nuninhabited areas in some of the countries, such as deserts, rain forests, and so on. Thus, for \ninstance, national population density will mute the effect of internal migration and urbanization \ntrends observed over the period in most of the countries studied. In future research, one might \nconsider supplementing a national population density measure with the ratio of urban to rural \npopulations or rates of growth of urban population. As shown in Figure 3a, population density \nhas steadily increased in the past 4 decades. \n\n \n \nFigure 3: Average Population Density and Real Income per Capita  \nin Asia and the Pacific (1971\u20132010) \n \n\n  \n  \n\n(a) Population Density \n(people per km2) \n\n(b) GDP per Capita \n(constant 2000 $)  \n\n \n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n10,000\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n \n\nkm2 = square kilometer. \n\nNote: Figures show data for 40 countries with complete time-series data only. \n\nSource: Population Density and GDP per capita data are from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators (WDI) Online \naccessed 14 January 2012 (http://databank.worldbank.org). \n\n \n \nOn vulnerability ((cid:1848)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)), cross-country experience suggests a split in the degree to which \npeople  are  affected  depending  on  incomes  broadly  and  poverty  specifically  (Kellenberg  and \nMobarak 2008, Kahn 2005). Initially, we use the national logarithm of real income per capita as \nproxy for economic vulnerability. We also report results when we add the square of the national \nlogarithm of real income per capita to capture the expected nonlinear, inverted-U relationship \nbetween  natural  disasters  and  average  income.  This  allows  for  the  possibility  that  as  income \nper  capita  initially  increases,  greater  economic  activity  and  associated  environmental \ndegradation make the population more vulnerable to natural disasters (i.e., likely to be killed or \naffected). After reaching a certain level of development, as income per capita grows further, the \n\n                                                 \n18   Population density in natural logarithm has greater explanatory power (i.e., explains more variance) than its level. \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   13 \n\neconomies and individuals are more capable of investing in disaster mitigation measures, and \nhence the risk of being \u201caffected\u201d declines. \n\n \nWe  also  consider  the  use  of  poverty  incidence  as  a  proxy  for  economic  vulnerability. \nHowever,  since  poverty  statistics  are  not  generated  frequently  enough  across  countries,  we \ncan only approximate vulnerability by a low poverty incidence dummy variable that is set to \u201c1\u201d \nif  the  average  poverty  head  count  ratio  or  the  proportion  of  people  living  below  $1.25 \npurchasing power parity (PPP) a day for all the years with available data is below or a certain \nthreshold. Otherwise, the vulnerability dummy variable takes a \u201c0\u201d value. However, the country \nfixed-effects model cannot efficiently estimate the effect of a time-invariant variable, such as this \nlow poverty incidence dummy, on panel data. \n\n \nFor the water-related climate hazard, we employ data on annual average precipitation \ndeviation ((cid:1849)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)) from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC 2011). This variable is \nin  some  ways  a  closer  measure  of  \u201cclimate  change\u201d  than  of  \u201cclimate  hazard.\u201d  Returning  to \nFigure 1, an ideal analytical approach would be to use a more direct measure of frequency and \nintensity  of  the  water-related  hazard  in  this  regression,  and  then  separately  tease  out  the \nrelationship  between  climate  change  and  the  prevalence  of  climate  hazards.  The  analytical \napproach  in  this  paper  effectively  combines  both  steps  into  one,  by  directly  exploring  the \nexplanatory power of the \u201cclimate change\u201d variables on natural disaster risk. This is convenient, \nhowever,  and (cid:1849)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) is  a  standard  climate  indicator  and  it  has  the  merit  of  being  measured  and \nmonitored regularly.  \n\n \nFor  the  temperature-related  climate  hazard,  we  similarly  employ  data  on  annual \naverage  surface  temperature  anomalies  or  HADCRUT3  ( (cid:1852)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) )  from  the  Met  Office  Hadley \nCentre and the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. Again, as per the earlier \ndiscussion, ideally a more direct measure of frequency and intensity of the heat-related hazard \nwould  have  been  employed,  and  then  the  relationship  between  this  variable  and  the  climate \nchange  variable  explored  separately.  Again,  the  analytical  approach  here  combines  these  two \nsteps into one. \n \nAverage  annual  precipitation  deviation  (and  temperature  anomaly)  is  defined  as  the \naverage  of  the  difference  between  the  annual  average  rainfall  (temperature)  and  the  30-year \n(1961\u20131990)  average  annual  rainfall  (temperature)  in  the  same  station  in  a  country  per  year. \nHistorical monthly data on precipitation deviations and temperature anomalies are available on \na  grid  box  basis.  To  generate  the  annual  average  precipitation  deviation  and  temperature \nanomalies data for each country based on these datasets, minimum and maximum grid values \nby country available at the Food and Agriculture Office of the United Nations were used. \n\n \nFigure  4a  shows  that  average  temperature  anomalies  in  1971\u20132010,  from  baseline \ntemperatures in 1960\u20131990, are rising across Asia and the Pacific. The 2012 and 2007 IPCC \nreports conclude that temperature increase is widespread over the globe. Brohan et al. (2006) \nand  The  Royal  Society  (2010)  suggest  the  rate  of  increase  in  both  land  and  marine \ntemperatures  in  current  periods  is  steeper  than  in  past  periods.  That  said,  the  rise  in \ntemperature anomalies vary across subregions, with some exhibiting notably more temperature \nvariability than others.  \n\n \nIn  contrast  with  the  rising  trend  in  temperature  anomalies,  deviations  of  precipitation \nfrom  the  average  of  monthly  precipitation  data  from  1960\u20131990  (see  Figure  4b),  when \naveraged  over  the  Asia and  Pacific region,  do  not show  a  clear  trend  during  1971\u20132000.  But \nprecipitation is even more spatially variable (Rudolf et al. 2010) than temperature. According to \n\n\f14   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\nthe 2012 IPCC Report \"[t]he AR4 concluded that it was likely that there had been increases in \nthe  frequency  of heavy precipitation  events  (e.g.,  95th  percentile)  over the  second  half  of the \n20th century within many land regions... There are \"wide regional and seasonal variations, and \ntrends  in  many  regions  are  not  statistically  significant...There  is  low  to  medium  confidence  in \ntrends  in  heavy  precipitation  in  Asia...  However,  statistically  significant  positive  and  negative \ntrends  were  observed  at  subregional  scales  within  these  regions...\"  Hence,  throughout  our \nanalysis, a separate panel data model with climate\u2013subregion dummy interaction terms is also \nestimated to test whether the climate coefficients vary across subregions. \n\n \n \nFigure 4: Precipitation Deviation and Temperature Anomalies in Asia and the Pacific \n(1971\u20132010) \n \n\n(a) Average Temperature Anomalies (\u00b0C)\n\n(b) Average Precipitation Deviations from Normal\n(millimeters per month)\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n\u221210\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n \n\nSources: Data on temperature anomalies (HADCRUT3) are from the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climate Research Unit (2012). Data \non precipitation deviations from normal are from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (2011).  \n\n \nThe  models  in  equations  (1)  and  (2)  examine  the  relevant  relationships  on  an  annual \nbasis.  Since  changes  in  climate  typically  persist  for  decades  or  longer  (IPCC  2012),  we  also \nexplore  how  exposure,  vulnerability,  and  climate  hazards  contribute  to  increasing  natural \ndisasters on a decadal basis. Hence, in addition to the models in equations (1) and (2), we also \nexamine  panel  generalized  least  squares  regressions  of  decadal  average  annual  climate-\nrelated  disasters  on  the  natural  logarithm  of  decadal  average  population  density,  natural \nlogarithm of decadal average real income per capita and its square, decadal average monthly \nprecipitation  deviation,  and  decadal  average  population  level,  with  random  and  country  fixed \neffects.19 To capture the effect of frequency of extreme climate events, we also run the model \nusing  the  number  of  years  when  annual  average  precipitation  (temperature)  exceeded  the \naverage precipitation (temperature) in 1961\u20131990, as the proxy for the frequency and intensity \nof climate hazards.  \n\n \nResults \n\nB. \n \nThe  results  are  presented  in  four  parts.  First,  we  present  results  for  hydrometeorological \nnatural  disasters  using  annual  data  in  Table  2,  as  per  equation  (1).  Second,  we  explore  the \nimplications  of  these  results  in  Table  3.  Third,  we  present  results  for  climatological  natural \ndisasters, as per equation (2), in Table 4. Fourth, we examine the decadal analysis discussed \nabove for hydrometerological and climatological natural disasters in Table 5. \n\n                                                 \n19   Only  the  economies  with  complete  observations  per  decade  are  included  in  the  panel  regressions.  Of  the  58 \n\neconomies included in the panel for the negative binomial regressions, only 52 were included here. \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   15 \n\nTable 2 shows the results for the model in equation (1) with random and country-fixed \neffects, unpacking the drivers of hydrometeorological (storms, floods, etc.) natural disasters for \nAsia  and  the  Pacific  in  the  past  4  decades,  using  annual  data.  Results  of  generalized \nHausmann  specification  tests  (Hausman  and  Taylor  1981),  as  well  as  the  strongly  significant \nestimates  for  most  country  dummies,  suggest  the  use  of  country  fixed-effects,  instead  of \nrandom  effects.  These  results  confirm  that  there  are  country-specific  factors  (such  as \ngovernance, quality of institutions) that are not related to primary risk factors, but contribute to \nthe rise in intense climate-related disasters in the region. \n\n \nWe  find  a  statistically  significant  relationship  between  the  frequency  of  intense \nhydrometeorological  natural  disasters  and  two  of  the  three  drivers\u2014exposure  and  climate \nhazards. The relationship between disasters and exposure is strong. The relationship between \nnatural disasters and climate hazards is statistically significant but less strong. We do not find \nsignificance in the relationship between natural disasters and the vulnerability variable. \n\n \nTable 2: Determinants of the Frequency of Intense Hydrometeorological Disasters \nin Asia and the Pacific \nDependent Variable: Frequency of Intense Hydrometeorological Disasters (1971\u20132010) \n \nRandom effects\n\nCountry-fixed effects\n\n \nExplanatory Variables \n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nExposure \nLn(population density) \n \nVulnerability \nLn(GDP per capita, constant 2000 $) \n \nSquare of Ln(GDP per capita, constant 2000 $) \n \nClimate hazard \nAverage precipitation deviation \n \nAverage precipitation deviation x East Asia \n \nAverage precipitation deviation x South Asia \n \nAverage precipitation deviation x Central Asia \n \nAverage precipitation deviation x Pacific \n \nPopulation (in million) \n \nObservations \nNumber of economies \nPseudo R-squared \nAlpha \nLR test of alpha=0 (Chi-bar, (cid:2031)(cid:1191)) \n\n0.2366 \n[0.148] \n \n0.9213 \n[1.460] \n\u20130.0758 \n[0.100] \n \n0.0111*** \n[0.002] \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0.0023*** \n[0.001] \n1,685 \n58 \n0.099 \n1.631 \n691.9 \n\n0.2409 \n[0.149] \n \n0.9525 \n[1.462] \n\u20130.0776 \n[0.100] \n \n0.0114*** \n[0.002] \n\u20130.0086** \n[0.004] \n0.0054 \n[0.004] \n0.0497*** \n[0.016] \n\u20130.0021 \n[0.005] \n0.0023*** \n[0.001] \n1,685 \n58 \n0.100 \n1.622 \n679.7 \n\n(3) \n \n1.1928*** \n[0.255] \n \n1.9222 \n[1.242] \n\u20130.1101 \n[0.086] \n \n0.0062*** \n[0.002] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u20130.0002 \n[0.001] \n1,685 \n58 \n0.369 \n0.049 \n9.032 \n\n(4)\n\n1.2429*** \n[0.258] \n \n1.9601 \n[1.242] \n\u20130.1121 \n[0.086] \n \n0.0037*** \n[0.001] \n0.0074*** \n[0.002] \n0.0127*** \n[0.002] \n0.0995*** \n[0.026] \n\u20130.0014 \n[0.005] \n\u20130.0003 \n[0.001] \n1,685 \n58 \n0.372 \n0.046 \n8.180 \n\nNotes: *** significant at 1%.

Specifically,  a  1% \nincrease in  population  density  is  associated with  a  1.2%  increase in  the  frequency  of  intense \nhydrometeorological  disasters  (see  columns  3  and  4  in  Table  2).  This  suggests  that  all  else \nequal, economies that are more densely populated are more likely to incur over 100 deaths or \nhave over 1,000 people affected when a storm or flood hits. \n\n \nCoefficients for vulnerability are not statistically significant. When vulnerability is proxied \nby  average  income  level,  although  we  observe  the  hypothesized  nonlinear  inverted-U \nrelationship  between  income  and  the  frequency  of  intense  disasters,  the  coefficients  are  not \nstatistically  significant.  When  vulnerability  is  proxied  by  a  low  poverty  dummy,  the  coefficient \nestimates  are  not  robust  to  changes  in  sample  time  periods  (such  as  1980\u20132010  or  1990\u2013\n2010),  or  the  use  of  different  threshold  levels  for  poverty  head  count  ratio  (such  as  25%  or \n35%20).   \n\n \nFinally,  the  climate  hazard  variables  are  a  significant  determinant  of  the  rise  in  the \nfrequency of intense disasters as well. Holding other variables constant, a unit increase in the \nannual average precipitation deviation from the 30-year average baseline rainfall (1960\u20131990) \nis  associated  with  around  a  0.6%  increase  in  the  frequency  of  intense  hydrometeorological \ndisasters across the economies in the region.  \n\n \nThe  relationship  between  frequency  of  intense  hydrometeorological  disasters  and \naverage  precipitation  deviation  remains  positive  and  strongly  significant  when  climate\u2013\nsubregion  interaction  terms  are  used  (columns  2  and  4).  The  coefficient  for  average \nprecipitation deviation varies across subregions. For example, results in column 4 suggest that \na unit increase in the annual average precipitation deviation is associated with a 0.4% average \nincrease in frequency of intense hydrometeorological disasters in Southeast Asia; 1.1% in East \nAsia (i.e., multiplying the sum of 0.0037 and 0.0074 by 100%); 1.6% in South Asia; 10.3% in \nCentral Asia; and 0.2% in the Pacific. Except for the Pacific, all the coefficient estimates for the \nclimate\u2013subregion  interaction  terms  are  significantly  different  from  zero.  The  coefficient \nestimates  for  average  precipitation  deviation  remain  positive  and  strongly  significant  when  a \ntime  trend  variable  is  included  to  control  for  other  factors  that  affect  the  frequency  of  intense \ndisasters and that are not directly observable but are highly correlated with time (e.g., location \nof  population).  The  coefficient  of  the  time  trend  variable  is  significant  and  positive  across \nspecifications (see Appendix Table 3). \n\n \nIn Table 3, we illustrate what this might mean for Asian and Pacific countries. Using the \ncoefficient  estimates  for  average  precipitation  in  the  specification  with  the  highest  pseudo  \nR-squared  (column  4  in  Table  2),  we  estimate  the  increase  in  the  frequency  of  intense \nhydrometeorological  disasters  from  the  2001\u20132010  levels  for  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and \nThailand  under  three  scenarios.  We  use  the  observed  increase  in  average  precipitation \ndeviation from 1991\u20132000 to 2001\u20132010 (8.33 millimeters [mm] per month) among economies \nin  Southeast  Asia 21 for  setting  the  possible  increase  in  the  average  precipitation  deviation \nunder  three  scenarios:  Scenario  1  (low  increase)  represents  an  increase  in  the  deviation  by \n4 mm  per  month;  Scenario  2  (moderate  increase)  by  8  mm  per  month;  and  Scenario  3  (high \nincrease) by 12 mm per month.  \n                                                 \n20   For example, if the poverty threshold level is set to 35%, the coefficient of the low poverty incidence dummy is \n\nnegative but not significantly different from zero (see Appendix Table 2). \n\n21   This  is  based  on  the  average  precipitation  deviation  of  eight  economies  in  Southeast  Asia  with  complete \nobservations from 1991 to 2010: Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nthe Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   17 \n\nTable 3: Estimated Changes in the Frequency of Intense Hydrometeorological Disasters \nAssociated with an Increase in Average Precipitation Deviations \n \n\nAverage \nFrequency of \nHydro-\nmeteorological \nDisasters \n(2001\u20132010) \n6.00 \n11.80 \n3.60 \n\nAverage \nPrecipitation \nDeviation \n(millimeters per \nmonth, \n2001\u20132010)\n\n9.92 \n10.84 \n1.14 \n\nCountry \nIndonesia \nPhilippines \nThailand \n\nScenario 1: \nLow Increase \n(dW = 4) \n\nScenario 2: \nModerate Increase \n(dW = 8) \n\nScenario 3:\nHigh Increase \n(dW = 12) \n\nEstimated Increase in the Average Annual \nFrequency of Intense Hydrometeorological \nDisasters Associated with an Increase in Average \nPrecipitation Deviation (cid:4666)(cid:2186)(cid:2164) (cid:3404) (cid:2236)(cid:2780) (cid:1499) (cid:2186)(cid:2179) \u00b7 (cid:2164)(cid:2197)) \n0.18 \n0.09 \n0.35 \n0.18 \n0.11 \n0.05 \n\n0.27 \n0.53 \n0.16 \n\nNotes: Estimates are computed using the estimated coefficient of \u2018Average precipitation deviation\u2019  for the reference subregion \n(Southeast Asia) in Table 2 column (4), that is, (cid:2010)(cid:2871) = 0.0037. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n \nThe  estimates  suggest  that,  holding  other  things  constant,  average  precipitation \ndeviation  increases  by  another  8  mm  per  month  (moderate  scenario),  as  experienced  in \nSoutheast  Asia  in  the  last  decade,  could  be  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  average \nfrequency of hydrometeorological disasters in Indonesia by an average of around 0.18 per year \nfrom  an  average  of  6  a  year \nto  an  additional \nin  2001\u20132010.

Meanwhile,  the  same  would  be \nassociated  with  an  increase  of  around  0.35  disaster  a  year,  or  an  additional  disaster  every \n3 years  in  the  Philippines;  and  around  0.11  disasters  a  year  in  Thailand,  or  an  additional \ndisaster  every  9  years.  If  the  increase  in  average  precipitation  hits  12  mm  per  month  (high \nscenario), greater increases in the frequency of intense hydrometeorological disasters can be \nexpected:  1  disaster  every  4  years  in  Indonesia,  every  2  years  in  the  Philippines,  and  every \n6 years in Thailand.  \n\nis  equivalent \n\n \n\nTable  4  confirms  a  negative  relationship  between  average  precipitation  deviation  and \nintense  climatological  disasters,  and  a  positive  relationship  between  temperature  anomalies. \nThe  coefficients  of  these  two  climate  variables  are  significant  with  both  random  and  country \nfixed-effects.  However,  the  coefficients  for  both  precipitation  deviation  and  temperature \nanomalies  are  statistically  insignificant  after  including  climate\u2013subregion  interaction  terms  in \nthe  regression.  Except  for  Central  Asia,  no  significant  variation  in  the  effect  of  average \nprecipitation deviation on climatological disasters across subregions was detected.

Robust statistics in brackets. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \nOur  results  suggest  that  the  three  factors\u2014rising  population  exposure,  population \nvulnerability,  and  changing  climate\u2014may  play  a  role  in  explaining  the  rising  frequency  of \nintense  climate-related  disasters  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  While  climatological  disasters  are \nclearly  associated  with  changing  temperature,  hydrometeorological  disasters  are  most  clearly \nassociated with rising exposure. \n\n \nJennings  (2011)  developed  a  similar  analysis  on  EM-DAT  disaster  data  starting  in the \n1980s,  but  for  all  types  of  natural  disasters  with  factors  identified  including  population \nexposure,  vulnerability,  as  well  as  other  factors  that  affect  their  reporting  (such  as  press \nfreedom  in  a  country).  While  this  study  similarly  points  to  the  significance  of  exposure  and \nvulnerability  indicators  in  disaster  data,  it  also  includes  an  acknowledgement  of  the  likely \n\n\f20   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\neffects of weather or climate change shocks, which IPCC (2012) suggests is indicative of the \nchanging climate. \n\n \nThe  panel  regressions  employed  here  have  limitations.  The  panel  data  used  in  the \nregressions are unbalanced since data for climate and vulnerability indicators are not available \nfor  some  years  in  some  countries  for  the  period  under  study.  Also,  population  exposure  and \nvulnerability  may  not  be  fully  exogenous.  If  the  regressors  are  not  strongly  exogenous,  then \nmaximum likelihood estimator will produce inconsistent estimates, which would imply that one \ncannot  rely  on  the  coefficient  estimates  to  compute  the  marginal  effects.  Nonetheless,  while \nthe frequency of disasters may affect the population exposed to disasters and their income, its \ndirect effect on the exposure and vulnerability indicators in this paper is expected to be limited.  \n\n \nAlthough the structural model made use of the Figure 1 framework, it was constrained \nby data availability. For example, while variables such as land use (see Brath, Montanari, and \nMoretti  2006),  the  actual  number  of  people  living  in  the  hazard-prone  areas,  or  the  share  of \nthese  figures  to  the  total  population  would  be  of  keen  interest,  these  are  neither  regularly \ngenerated  nor  readily  available.  Furthermore,  the  analysis  employed  annual  data  because \ncontrol  variables, such as population  density  and  population,  are  available  only  on  an  annual \nbasis.  \n\n \n \nV. CLIMATE TRENDS AND PATTERNS IN THE PHILIPPINES \n \nTo  complement  the  review  of  the  rise  in  intense  disasters  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  in  the \nprevious sections, this section presents more detailed climate data from the Philippines, where \nit is the behavior and intensity of extreme hydrometeorological events and not the frequency, \nthat is rising.  \n \n\nAn archipelago of 7,100 islands with a vast number of low-lying areas and steep inland \nterrain,  the  Philippines  is  a  global  hotspot  for  hydrometeorological  disasters.  The  United \nNations University Institute for Environment and Human Security ranked it third in the world on \ndisaster risk in 2011. Within Asia and the Pacific, the Philippines experienced the fourth highest \nfrequency  (98)  of  intense  hydrological  disasters  during  1971\u20132010,  topped  only  by  Indonesia \n(124),  India  (167),  and  the  PRC  (172),  all  of  which  have  much  larger  land  areas.  But  the \nPhilippines experienced the highest frequency (218) of intense meteorological disasters in the \nregion  during  the  same  time.  The  Philippines  has  one  of  the  longest  coastlines  in  the  world \n(32,400 km), with its eastern seaboard on the Pacific, the ocean basin with the highest annual \nfrequency of tropical cyclones north of the equator.23 \n\n \nThe  typical  path  of  cyclones  has  also  shifted  southward,  tropical  cyclones  of  weaker \nintensity  now  have  very  intense  associated  rains,  while  the  frequency  of  hot  days  and  warm \nnights is increasing. Climate models suggest that the increasing trend in the frequency of hot \ndays will continue. \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n23   Tropical cyclones are atmospheric low pressure systems generated in the tropical and subtropical regions. They \n\nrange from north of the equator and west of 180\u00b0E. \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   21 \n\nTropical Cyclones and Typhoons \n\nA. \n \nThe use of radars and satellites for detection of cyclones began in the early 1970s (Knutson et \nal.  2010  and  Landsea  et  al.  2006),  so  cyclone  data  are  not  perfectly  comparable  over  time. \nThat  said,  the  Philippine  government\u2019s  meteorological  office\u2014the  Philippine  Atmospheric, \nGeophysical  and  Astronomical  Services  Administration  (PAGASA)\u2014suggests  that  from  1951 \nto 2010, the frequency of tropical cyclones affecting the country did not increase. An average \nof  19  to  20  tropical  cyclones  hit  the  country  per  year  during  the  following  30-year  rolling \nperiods:  1951\u20131980,  1961\u20131990,  1971\u20132000,  and  1981\u20132010.  During  1971\u20132010,  about  six \nextreme typhoons with maximum sustained winds of greater than 150 km per hour affected the \nPhilippines.24 No significant trend is observed in the frequency of extreme typhoons (PAGASA \n2011).  \n \nThe Manila Observatory (2011), which also tracks weather events, concludes that there \nwere  no  clear  trends  in  the  annual  frequency  of  tropical  cyclones,  typhoons,  and  extreme \ntyphoons  during  1945\u20132010.  Annual  frequency  has  been  highly  variable  (between  9 and  26), \nbut  with  no  clear  long-term  trend.  The  share  of  typhoons  to  tropical  cyclones  also  varied \nbetween 42% and 90%, but again, with no clear long-term trend.  \n\n \nTo begin, gain strength, and determine their path, tropical cyclones depend on specific, \nlocal,  atmospheric  circulation  patterns  and  oceanic  and  atmospheric  variables.  Damage  is \ncaused  by  high  winds  and  heavy  rains.  Even  though  no  increase  in  the  frequency  of  tropical \ncyclones and extreme typhoons in the Philippines is discernible, evidence exists that the nature \nof these hazards is changing, both in warmer temperatures and heavier rainfall. \n\n \nHistorical Temperatures \n\nB. \n \nAs  in  many  parts  of  the  world,  temperatures  have  risen  in  the  Philippines  (Figure  5),  with \nannual  means  rising  by  0.65\u00b0C  during  1951\u20132005,  or  an  average  of  0.0108\u00b0C  per  year \nincrease.

This leads to increased \nmoisture  in  the  atmosphere  for  storms,  whether  individual  thunderstorms,  extra  tropical  rain, \nsnow storms, or tropical cyclones, to produce more intense precipitation events. Such events \nare  widely  observed,  even  where  total  precipitation  is  decreasing.  Usually,  when  it  rains  it \npours, increasing the risk of flooding. \n \n\nConsistent with observed temperature increases, an increase in the frequency of more \nextreme rainfall events (with 350-mm rainfall or higher) in the latter part of the 20th century was \nobserved. From 1903 to 2005, important wet periods were observed in the early to mid-1970s \nand  the  late  1990s,  and  relatively  dry  periods  in  the  mid-1960s  and  mid-1990s  (Kubota  and \nChan 2009). However, no clear trends are observed in annual total rainfall, in part due to the \nsignificant  inter-decade  variation  caused  by  persistent  changes  in  atmospheric  circulation \npatterns.  \n\n \nFrom 2001 to 2008, the 24-hour rainfall intensity (the amount of rainfall over a 24-hour \nperiod), appeared to increase in most parts of the country relative to the 1971\u20132000 baseline \nvalues.  But  not  all  of  these  increases  are  statistically  significant  (PAGASA  2011).  There  is \nevidence  of  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  rainfall  intensity  in  the  cities  of  Baguio  in  the \nnorthern Philippines, and Tacloban and Iloilo further south in the Visayas. And the frequency of \nextreme daily rainfall in most parts of the country is also, generally, trending higher.25 Positive \ntrends are significant only in the cities of Calapan, Laoag, Iloilo, and Tacloban; for the island of \nPalawan, the reverse trend is significant. \n\nProjected Changes in Temperature and Rainfall \n\n \nThe  typical  paths  of  tropical  cyclones  per  decade  have  been  changing  too.  A  30-year \nrunning  average  of  the  frequency  of  tropical  cyclones  passing  over  the  Philippines  (PAGASA \n2011)  indicates  that  there  was  a  slight  increase  in  the  Visayas  during  1971\u20132000  compared \nwith 1951\u20131980 and 1960\u20131990. Anglo (2005) also showed that the tropical cyclone pathway \nhas shifted southward towards the central Philippines. \n \nD. \n \nIn its Special Report on Emission Scenarios (IPCC 2000), the IPCC outlined various expected \nGHG  changes  for  projecting  future  climate  conditions  with  climate  models.  These  GHG \nscenarios,  used  extensively  in  the  IPCC\u2019s  third  and  fourth  assessment  reports  (IPCC  2001, \n2007),  were  based  on  the  established  relationship  between  the  atmospheric  concentration  of \nGHGs  and  changes  in  the  climate,  especially  temperature.  These  scenarios  can  roughly  be \ncategorized  into  four:  two  that  pertain  to  the  focus  of  development,  or  (A)  economic  or  (B) \nenvironmental; multiplied by two that describe the homogeneity or heterogeneity of economies, \nor (1) greater globalization versus (2) more intense regional uniqueness. GHG emissions vary \nacross  these  four  scenarios\u2014emissions  are  high  for  the  A2  scenario  (economic,  intense \nregional  uniqueness),  low  for  B1  (environmental,  greater  globalization),  and  medium  for  A1B \n(midway between economic and environmental focus, with greater globalization). \n\n \nFigure  7  illustrates  the  results  of  the  Manila  Observatory  research  on  projected \ntemperature  in  the  Philippines  using  the  medium,  A1B  scenario.  Average  temperature  is \n\n                                                 \n25   Extreme daily rainfall refers to the upper part of a probability distribution, usually known as the tail, which governs \n\nboth the magnitude and the frequency. \n\n\f24   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\nprojected  to  increase  by  0.8\u00b0C\u20132.2\u00b0C  by  2020  and  2050,  respectively  over  the  entire  country \nfor the A1B IPCC scenario, compared to the 1961\u20131990 average. There is a noticeable shift of \nmore  frequent  days  having  28\u00b0C  in  2020  and  29\u00b0C  in  2050  compared  to  the  baseline,  with \nconsiderable  regional  variation.  In  particular,  the  regions  of  Mindanao  and  Southern  Visayas \nare  expected  to  be  considerably  warmer  in  2020  and  2050  compared  with  Luzon,  with  the \nlargest increase in temperature expected on the Zamboanga Peninsula in southern Mindanao.  \n\n \nAlso, using temperature projections in the medium-range scenario (A1B), the frequency \nof  hot  days,  with  a  maximum  temperature  of  30\u00b0C  or  higher,  generally  increases  over  the \nPhilippines.  \n \n\nFigure 7: Projected Temperature, Philippines (2020 and 2050) \n \n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,00\n\n500\n\n0\n\ny\nc\nn\ne\nu\nq\ne\nr\nF\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34\n\nAnnual Mean Temperature (\u00b0C)\n\nBaseline\n\n2020s\n\n2050s\n\n \n\nNote: Baseline refers to 1960\u20131990 temperature values. \n\nSource: Manila Observatory. 2012. Temperature Projections for the Philippines. Unpublished report. \n\n \n \nPrecipitation  changes  are  expected  to  be  more  variable.  Whereas  climate  models \nproject  temperature  increases  practically  everywhere  as  GHG  concentration  increases,  IPCC \n(2007)  indicates  that  globally,  precipitation  will  increase  in  some  regions  and  decrease  in \nothers.  Precipitation  may  increase  in  high-latitude  regions  and  decrease  in  the  tropics, \naccording to the global climate model results.  \n\n \nThe  Manila  Observatory  (2011)  reports  that  by  2020  there  will  be  an  increase  or  no \nchange in average rainfall in Luzon, and a decrease in average rainfall in most other parts of \nthe country. By 2050, it is expected that the Visayas and Mindanao will be drier than normal. \nFor  extreme  precipitation  in  the  Philippines,  the  frequency  of  days  with  heavy  precipitation \n(greater  than  200  mm,  for  example)  is  expected  to  increase  significantly  by  2020  and  2050 \namid global warming.  \n\n \n \nVI. POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n \nHazards of nature have always been with us. Some regions, such as Asia and the Pacific, and \ncountries, such as the Philippines, have been systematically affected more than others by the \ndisasters these hazards cause. There has been progress in technology and preparedness that \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   25 \n\nhas  helped  to  reduce  casualties.  Yet,  growing  exposure,  greater  vulnerability,  and  greater \nfrequency  of  extreme  hazards  have  contributed  to  greater  destruction  and  damage  from \ndisasters in recent decades.  \n\n \nClimate change turns out to be relevant to the findings of this paper and this discussion. \nThe extent to which human emissions of greenhouse gases are causing changes in the climate \nhas been examined by scientists for over 150 years, since Fourier in 1824 and Tyndall in 1864. \nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations have recently surpassed 400 parts per million (ppm) and are \nset to reach 450 ppm in less than a quarter of a century, given current increases of over 2 ppm \na  year.  Many  scientists  consider  450  ppm  to  be  dangerous,  given  the  implications  for  the \nincrease  in  mean  near-surface  air  temperature  and  its  related  impacts  on  climate-related \ndisasters \n\n \nIndeed,  recent  observations  connect  rising  GHG  emissions  to  increased  atmospheric \nconcentrations,  and  then  to  changes  in  climate  variables  (such  as  temperature  and \nprecipitation).  Given  this  body  of  scientific  knowledge,  the  findings  in  this  paper  lead  to  the \nsuggestion that there is a link between increasing natural disasters in Asia and the Pacific and \nman-made  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere.  In  these  circumstances,  this \npaper\u2019s  findings  lead  to  three  sets  of  implications  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific\u2014which  has  led  the \nworld in economic growth and poverty reduction in the last 50 years.  \n\n \nFirst,  disaster  prevention,  which  is  seldom  emphasized  as  much  as  disaster  response, \nneeds  to  feature  as  an  integral  part  of  development  strategies.  Data  presented  in  this  paper \ndraw attention to an unmistakable increase in the worldwide frequency of hydrometeorological \nand  climatological  disasters  in  recent  decades.  By  chronicling  the  rising  frequency  of \nhydrometeorological  events  globally  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  in  the  Philippines,  this  paper \ndraws attention to the risk these growing disasters pose for development.  \n\n \nHydrometeorological  disaster  risk  is  seen  to  vary  enormously  across  subregions  and \nfrom country to country. It is taking a heavier toll on more densely populated, poorer, and more \nenvironmentally degraded areas. The recent trends in disasters suggest that if they continue, \nthe growing threat of natural disasters could soon prove to be a game changer in development \nplans and policies.  \n\n \nHigh  population  exposure  and  worsening  climate  trends  related  to  natural  disasters  in \nAsia and the Pacific loom over the region\u2019s economic success and strategic importance in the \nglobal  economy.  The  region\u2019s  population  continues  to  rise  relative  to  the  global  total,  and  its \neconomy  helps  drive  global  economic  growth.  Yet,  global  manufacturing  has  moved  to  some \nvery hazard-prone and ill-prepared areas. The Thailand floods of 2011 and their huge impact \non the supply of computer hard drives and auto parts is one example. \n\n \nSecond, climate action needs to be added as a crucial dimension in disaster prevention. \nClimate  mitigation\u2014reducing  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere\u2014is  also  essential  to \nconfronting  the  rising  trend  in  climate-related  disasters.  Focusing  on  hydrometeorological  and \nclimatological events, the paper suggests that some impacts of man-made climate change are \noccurring.  Even  as  the  detailed  temporal  and  spatial  distribution  of  temperature  and \nprecipitation  associated  with  these  events  is  becoming  more  variable  and  extreme,  some \ntrends  are  also  emerging.  The  data  and  analysis  presented  here  add  a  global  and  local \ncomplement  to  other  analysis  suggesting  a  link  between  climate  change  and  changes  in  the \npattern of natural disasters. \n\n \n\n\f26   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 358 \n\nAn  association,  no  matter  how  strong,  does  not  necessarily  show  causality.  In  that \nspirit,  an  individual  disaster,  such  as  the  Pakistan  floods  of  2010  or  the  Thailand  floods  of \n2011,  cannot  necessarily  be  attributed  to  climate  change  triggered  by  rising  GHGs.  These \nevents and their event-to-event differences have always been part of our environment. But we \nknow  that  GHG  emissions  are  increasing  GHG  atmospheric  concentrations,  and  that  this  is \nincreasing  temperatures  and  changing  our  climate.  While  there  remain  great  uncertainties  in \nthe precise impacts, this paper adds to the expectation that these changes may be resulting in \nmore intense floods, storms, and droughts. \n \n\nIn  the  Philippines,  it  is  not  the  frequency,  but  the  intensity  of  relatively  more  extreme \nevents  that  is  on  the  rise.  The  path  of  cyclones  has  changed,  tropical  cyclones  of  weaker \nintensity  now  have  very  intense  associated  rains,  and  the  frequency  of  hot  days  and  warm \nnights is increasing. And climate models suggest that the increasing trend in the frequency of \nhot days will continue.  \n\n \nThird, climate adaptation, relating to people\u2019s exposure and vulnerability to the risks (for \nexample,  through  policies  influencing  their  location),  could  help  ameliorate  disaster  impacts. \nAnalysis in the paper suggests that, in addition to nature, there is also a human hand in both \nexplaining and responding to disasters. Natural disasters are, almost by definition, considered \nto be acts of nature. However, if humans knowingly live in dangerous locations and fail to take \npreventative  measures,  then  nature  cannot  be  entirely  blamed  for  the  harm  suffered.  By  and \nlarge,  countries  have  tended  to  view  disaster  risk  management  as  a  cost  rather  than  as \ninvestment  needed  for  saving  lives  and  livelihoods,  reducing  disaster  threats  to  critical \ninfrastructure, and promoting sustainable development.  \n\n \nTypically,  disaster  response  is  just  that\u2014reaction  in  relief  and  reconstruction,  with \ninadequate  thought  to  proactive  response  and  prevention.  Some  estimates  point  to  the  high \npayoff  of  disaster  prevention  (Hallegatte  2012,  World  Bank  2010),  but  rigorous  evaluation  of \nthe net benefits might help spur policy action. But there may be a danger that we are \u201cmopping \nthe floor when the tap is still running.\u201d Given rising population exposure, ongoing limitations in \nadaptive capacity, and anthropogenic climate change, it is straightforward to make a case for \nprevention, preparedness, and planning in the face of these disaster risks.  \n\n \nThere is a need to address both \u201cproximal\u201d and \u201cdistal\u201d causes of disasters. Inadequate \npreparation and response are \u201cproximal\u201d causes, such as levee failures along the Indus River \nin Pakistan in 2010 and the Kosi River in India in 2008. This paper has focused on the \u201cdistal\u201d \ncauses,  including  increased  population  exposure,  changing  climate,  and  greater  vulnerability. \nTo  take  the  example  of  the  2010  Indus  floods  again,  the  \u201cdistal\u201d  causes  included  the \nmeteorological circumstances of the rainfall in the upstream Indus, which were causally linked \nto  unusual  circulation  patterns  that  also  caused  extreme  drought  and  fires  in  the  Russian \nRepublic earlier that year (Lau and Kim 2012).  \n\n \nOne  implication  is  that  strong  economic  and  social  returns  may  be  derived  from \ninvestments in better understanding of shifting climate patterns, including hazard mapping and \nother  risk  assessment  systems,  as  well  as  better  location  decisions  for  households  and \nbusinesses  and  stronger  environmental  protection.  But  these  trends  are  also  telling  us  that \nadaptation  must  be  accompanied  by  mitigation.  Climate  change  mitigation,  such  as \naccelerating plans for energy efficiency, clean energy, forest protection, and reforestation, are \nneeded urgently.  \n\n \n\n\fClimate-Related Disasters in Asia and the Pacific   \u0406   27 \n\nThere is need to acknowledge the complexity of understanding natural disasters in the \ncontext  of  a  changing  climate  and  rapidly  growing  populations  and  economies  (Ward  et  al. \n2012, Hepburn and Ward 2011). Within that understanding, the paper points to new trends in \nclimate-related disasters across Asia and the Pacific. The emerging phenomenon should be a \nserious concern for governments, the development community, and all societies.

At the same time, the climate in the region is observed to \nbe changing.  Three disaster risk factors\u2014rising population exposure, greater population vulnerability, and \nincreasing climate-related hazards\u2014are found to be associated with the increased frequency of intense natural \ndisasters in the region.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.7 billion people who \nlive on less than $2 a day, with 828 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed \nto reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, \nand regional integration.\n \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
