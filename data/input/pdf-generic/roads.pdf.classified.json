The study was financed through a $600,000 regional\ntechnical assistance grant - RETA 5753: Developing Best Practices for Promoting Private Sector\nInvestment in Infrastructure. This report focuses on the road sector; the other reports cover the\npower, water supply, airport and air traffic control, and port sectors.\n\nTransport is central to achieving prosperity and the quality of life, to which all countries\naspire.  Transport  policy  has  pervasive  impacts:  on  economic  performance;  on  the  shape  and\nstructure  of  human  settlements  through  its  impact  upon  physical  development  and  economic\nstructures;  on  the  distribution  of  income;  and  on  the  environment.  This  report  develops  best\npractices for promoting private sector investment in the road sector. It defines the objectives of\nprivate  sector  participation,  reviews  experiences  of  private  sector  participation  in  Asia  and\nelsewhere, examines the degree of success that has been achieved to date, and identifies the\nkey issues that provide the basis for determining best practices. In addition, the report discusses\nADB\u2019s role in facilitating both private sector participation and competition in the road sector. It is\nhoped  that  the  report  will  help  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  successfully  attract  well\nmanaged and cost-effective private investment.\n\nThe five reports have benefited from the support of and valuable contributions from many\nindividuals,  both  inside  and  outside  ADB.  The  reports  were  prepared  by  a  team  of  individual\nconsultants: Water Supply - Michael Porter of Tasman Asia Pacific; Power - Elliot Roseman of\nPricewaterhouseCoopers; Ports - John Arnold, an independent ports specialist; Airports and Air\nTraffic Control - Ian Jones of National Economic Research Associates; and Roads - Roger\nAllport  of  Halcrow  Fox.  In  ADB,  Sean  O\u2019Sullivan,  Senior  Public/Private  Sector  Specialist\nmanaged  the  technical  assistance  implementation  with  the  help  of  Marcelo  Minc,  Project\nEconomist. ADB staff in the Energy; Transport and Communications; and Water Supply, Urban\nDevelopment and Housing Divisions as well as the Private Sector Group helped in guiding the\ndirection of the study and in reviewing the outputs. In December 1998, a workshop, hosted by\nADB as an integral component of the study, provided a forum for the exchange of ideas and\nexperiences.  Participation  and  contributions  of  delegates  from  many  developing  member\ncountries  and  representatives  from  the  private  sector  in  the  workshop  were  very  much\nappreciated by ADB.\n\nThe publication of the five reports is especially timely as it coincides with the introduction\n\nof a new strategy for private sector development by ADB.\n\nVladimir Bohun\nDirector\nInfrastructure, Energy and Financial\nSectors Department (East)\n\n\fADB\nBOl\nBOOT\nBOT\nCDCP\nCPI\nCREMA\nCTS\nDBFO\nDMC\nDNV\nDOH\nDPWH\nEBRD\nEIRR\nEPU\nETA\nEU\nGDP\nGSZ\nIADB\nICC\nIFC\nJBIC\n\nKL\nMRT\nMHA\nNESDB\nNPV\nNSE\nPEA\nPNCC\nPNR\nPRC\nPSP\nROT\nRTA\nSEM\nSTAR\nTA\nTCA\nUK\nUS\nWHC\nvpd\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nAsian Development Bank\nBoard of Investments\nbuild-own-operate-transfer\nbuild-operate-transfer\nConstruction and Development Corporation of the Philippines\nConsumer Price Index\nContrato de Recuperaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento\nComprehensive Transportation Studies\ndesign-build-finance-operate\ndeveloping member country\nDireci\u00f3n Nacional de Vialidad\nDepartment of Highways\nDepartment of Public Works and Highways\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\nEconomic Planning Unit\nExpressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand\nEuropean Union\ngross domestic product\nGuangzhou-Shuzhen-Zhuhai\nnter-American Development Bank\nnvestment Coordination Committee\nInternational Finance Corporation\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (formerly Japan I\nInternational Cooperation Agency/Overseas Economic\nCooperation Fund)\nKuala Lumpur\n\u2013\n\u2013 Mass Rapid Transit\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013 Western Harbour Crossing\n\u2013\n\nNational Highway Authority\nNational Economic and Social Development Board\nnet present value\nNorth-South Expressway\nPublic Estates Authority\nPhilippine National Construction Corporation\nPhilippine National Railway\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nprivate sector participation\nrehabilitate-operate-transfer\nRoad and Traffic Authority\nSocietes d\u2019conomie Mixte\nSouthern Tagalog Arterial Road\ntechnical  assistance\nTransportation Corridor Agency\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\n\nvehicles per day\n\n\fTABLE  OF  CONTENTS\n\nFOREWORD ............................................................................................................................... i\n\nABBREVIATIONS ......................................................................................................................... ii\n\nLIST OFTABLES .......................................................................................................................... v\n\nLIST OF FIGURES ...................................................................................................................... vi\n\nLIST OF BOXES ......................................................................................................................... vi\n\nEXECUTIVE  SUMMARY .......................................................................................................... vii\nContext ...................................................................................................................... vii\nBOT Project Experience ............................................................................................ vii\nTowards Best Practices ........................................................................................... viii\nProspects and Role for ADB .................................................................................... xiv\n\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\n\nPART ONE: STUDY OVERVIEW\n\nI.\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION .................................................................................................................. 1\n\nTHE GROWTH OF PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION .................................................. 2\nExpansion and Contraction of Private Sector Investment .......................................... 2\nA.\nThe Challenge for Private Sector Infrastructure Investment ....................................... 3\nB.\n\nIll.

The crisis has reinforced this, and brought\nabout  a  withdrawal  of  investor  confidence.  There  is  broad  agreement  that  countries  must  now\ndevelop a clear strategy, with four pillars:\n\nThe environment for PSP must be improved.\n\n\u2022 Government must determine sector priorities and identify a pipeline of PSP projects.\n\nThe full range of PSP modalities must be deployed, not just build-operate-transfer\n(BOT).\n\nThe procurement, implementation and operational processes must be improved.\n\nSince  the  crisis,  much  is  changing,  and  ADB  is  taking  a  leading  role  in  assisting  its\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). This is greatly welcomed by governments and the private\nsector alike.\n\nB.\n\nBOT  Project  Experience\n\nIn Asia, BOT projects have been synonymous with PSP. After more than a decade of\n\nconcerted effort, however, implementation experience has not matched expectations:\n\n\u2022 Surprisingly little has been implemented \u2014 just 20 projects are operational in Asia outside\n\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1\n\nThose  projects  implemented  have  usually  required  substantial,  unexpected\ngovernment support (the crisis is bringing home the impact of contingent guarantees).\nVery  few  projects  are  profitable  on  a  stand-alone  basis  without  substantial\ngovernment support.\n\n\u2022 Projects  have  had  unexpected  adverse  impacts  sometimes  contrary  to  government\npolicy. In particular, they have led to a concentration of government support in and near\nthe capital cities, and along existing major corridors.\n\nTheir cumulative impact upon the problems of the roads sector has been small. Most\nBOT  projects  have  been  concentrated  where  traffic  is  high,  and  PSP  has  had  little\nimpact on problems elsewhere.\n\nThere has been concern that financial objectives have been the sole determinant of\nwhat happens, to the detriment of development and social objectives.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n1\n\n Many more are operational in PRC, which is different for known reasons \u2014 see Appendix 2.\n\n\fviii\n\n\u2022\n\nThere  has  been  concern  that  corruption,  nepotism  and  cronyism  have  sometimes\nreduced the prospective benefits for road users.\n\nHowever, much has been learned, and there have been beacons of innovation. This report\n\nbrings all the international experience together, and recommends best practices.\n\nC.\n\nTowards Best Practices\n\n1.\n\nNeed for a Process\n\nDeveloping a pipeline of PSP projects in the roads sector requires government to determine\n\na process, which comprises the following activities, at two different levels:\n\n\u2022 Preparing the PSP environment \u2014 legal, regulatory, and contractual.\n\n\u2022\n\nIdentifying PSP projects in the context of a transport strategy and the realistic level of\npublic sector support necessary, both investment and contingent investment.\n\na.\n\nSector  Level\n\nb.\n\nProject  Level\n\n\u2022 Preparing a business case for each project, to establish the basis for bidding, and\n\nconfirm this is acceptable to government.\n\n\u2022 Securing competitive bids and negotiations leading to bid award.\n\n\u2022 Providing support and enforcing the concession agreement during construction.\n\n\u2022 Enforcing the concession agreement and regulating effectively during the concession\n\nperiod.\n\nThe economic crisis has reinforced on governments the need for increased transparency\nin the PSP process, and increased rigor in project preparation since they are now faced with a\nbetter  informed,  and  more  cautious  investment  community.  Governments  are  likely  to  need\nassistance until this demanding process is established both at the roads sector level and more\ngenerally in structuring the PSP environment.\n\n2.\n\nThe  PSP  Environment\n\na.\n\nCountry Conditions\n\nNot all countries are suited to PSP, and particularly to major BOT projects. PSP is likely to\n\nbe favored in countries where there is:\n\n\u2022 Political leadership and commitment to a PSP policy.\n\n\u2022 Political stability.\n\n\fix\n\n\u2022 An existing income level which is not low - and preferably an income distribution which\n\nis equitable.2\n\n\u2022 A sound macro-economy, creating increasing output and real income growth.\n\n\u2022\n\nLow and stable inflation.\n\n\u2022 A stable exchange rate.\n\n\u2022 Domestic capital markets capable of providing domestic financing.\n\n\u2022 A program of concession projects to build private sector confidence. This will also\nallow the government and the private sector to spread the learning-curve costs.\n\nThe absence of any one of these features may not hinder the prospects for PSP, but a\n\ncountry lacking points two or three will likely struggle to introduce effective PSP.\n\nb.\n\nProject  Characteristics\n\nSome types of projects are more likely to be implemented and financed than others. Broadly\nspeaking, the implementation and financing challenge increases with the size and complexity of\nthe PSP option (Table 1) and the challenge for government increases similarly.\n\nFor many countries, the entry route into PSP in roads should be through maintenance and\noperating concessions.  This  allows  the private sector and government to become familiar with\nperformance-based  contracting,  and  offers  the  prospect  of  tackling  the  maintenance  and\nrehabilitation problems, common in many countries.\n\nThe focus of most countries to date has, however, been on BOT expressways. Many of\nthese have not been financially successful. The characteristics favoring private financing of major\nBOT expressways are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Projects down existing heavily-trafficked/congested corridors, or where there are missing\nlinks in the network, e.g., estuarial crossings or tunnels. This maximizes traffic prospects\non opening, and minimizes land/relocation costs.\n\n\u2022\n\nInter-urban, as opposed to urban projects. This keeps the implementation problems\nand cost relatively low, reduces the traffic risk, and is likely to be effective in tackling\ntraffic congestion.\n\n\u2022 Elevated  or  preferably  at-grade  alignments  in  cities,  and  at-grade  construction  for\n\ninterurban projects. This keeps construction costs low.\n\n2\n\nThis is important because:\n\u2022 As  country  income  increases  project  benefits  and  revenues  increase  proportionately,  but  costs  much  less  so.  The  result  is\n\nthat  project  profitability  increases,  and  the  need  for  government  support  reduces.\n\n\u2022 Conversely, low-income countries require substantial government support, yet are unlikely to be able to provide it rationally\n\nbecause other projects should often have higher public investment priority.\n\n\u2022 Where income distribution is equitable, car ownership and use increases.\n\n\fx\n\n\u2022 Projects  in  middle-income  developing  countries,  preferably  with  an  equitable\nincome distribution. Here the willingness-to-pay tolls and the prospects for traffic growth\nexist.\n\n\u2022\n\nTariffs close to revenue-maximizing, and with an appropriate tariff escalation formula\nthat allows potential revenues to be captured over time, for the main vehicle classes.\n\n\u2022 Projects  with  an  existing  income  stream,  e.g.,  from  an  existing  estuarial\ncrossing/tunnel, or an existing public sector expressway. This is hugely beneficial\nto financing.\n\n\u2022 A  project  that  has  been  well  prepared  \u2014  in  technical  terms,  in  securing\nplanning consents and in proving the feasibility of land acquisition \u2014 thereby reducing\nimplementation risks.\n\n\u2022 A large project, which recognizes the high fixed bidding costs associated with BOT\n\nprojects.\n\n3.\n\nPreparing  the  PSP  Environment\n\nPolitical  leadership  is  essential.  Institutions  may  need  to  be  restructured,  with  the\nobjectives  of  controlling  the  PSP  process  in  the  public  interest,  avoiding  tendencies  for\ncorruption or empire building, and creating a regulatory body, separate from vested sector\ninterests.\n\nThe core requirements are:\n\ncountry specific.\n\n\u2022 Developing an acceptable PSP legal framework \u2014 the exact nature of which will be\n\n\u2022 Securing competition for the market. Government should identify good projects and\nthen subject those to competitive bidding (rather than the widespread existing practice\nof accepting unsolicited bids). Where unsolicited bids are accepted, they should be\nsubject to realistic competition.\n\n\u2022 Securing competition in the market. This requires:\n\n- Legally-binding  concession  agreements  which  set  out  clearly  the  rights  and\nobligations of all parties, and the procedures to be followed in the case of unforeseen\nevents.\n\n- Establishment  of  an  autonomous  and  independent  regulator  which  is  also\naccountable. This is likely to be in government, but quite separate from vested sector\ninterests.\n\n- Encouragement of user groups, maybe empowered through an ombudsman function,\n\nto exert pressure on infrastructure providers.\n\n\u2022 Granting  concessions  only  after  government  has  determined  they  are  clearly  in  the\n\npublic interest, and can be revoked if this is not met.\n\n\fxi\n\nMulti-lateral support for government is likely to be beneficial in implementation. A model that\nhas worked well combines a multi-sector PSP Center with PSP cells in the main line agencies.\nThe main PSP Center has the brief to assist line agencies prepare, market and negotiate projects,\nand is staffed accordingly.\n\n4.\n\nIdentifying PSP Projects\n\nThis is a government function, which must take place in the right institutional setting if the\n\nresults are to be accepted and implemented.\n\n3\nPriority projects must be identified in the context of a transport (or roads) strategy,\n in a two-\n\nstage  process.\n\na.\n\nPrepare Transport (or Roads) Strategy\n\nThis is required to:\n\npreparation.\n\n\u2022 Be acceptable, which means that all affected stakeholders should be involved in its\n\n\u2022\n\nIdentify the package of policies and priority projects which best promote development\nobjectives, given an assessment of existing problems and available future public funds.\n\n\u2022 Specifically, highlight those projects/programs which may be implemented under PSP\narrangements,  having  regard  to  strategic  objectives  and  the  range  of  PSP  options\navailable (see Table 1).\n\nStrategy  Objective\n\nMaintenance\n\nTurnkey\n\nTable 1: The PSP Options\n\nMaintain\n&  Operate\n\nRehabilitate-\nOperate-\nTransfer  (ROT)\n\nBOT\n\nCorredor\nManagement\n\nNew  source  of  funds\n\nMajor  capacity\nincrease  (new  road)\n\nImproved\nmaintenance\n\nRehabilitation of\nexisting  roads\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n3\n\nA  transport  strategy  is  normally  required  for  cities,  and  inter-urban  corridors  where  modal  competition  can  be  effective\n\n\fxii\n\nb.\n\nIdentify Priority PSP Projects\n\nGovernment must prepare feasibility studies, which will allow it to commit to specific\nprojects. Again, the institutional setting is central to achieving acceptability, and requires the\nparticipation of the key stakeholders.\n\nThis form of feasibility study requires:\n\n\u2022 A focus on optimizing the project specification, and delivering a project with robust\ncharacteristics. Specifically, the potential of the project to promote development,\nsocial, and environmental objectives, as well as economic efficiency, should be\naddressed.\n\n\u2022\n\nTariff policy should be set in the light of government objectives.\n\n\u2022 A focus on implementability and financing.\n\n\u2022 A  scope  including  all  those  activities  which  affect  government\u2019s  decision as to\nwhether to go ahead (technical, economic, financial, institutional, legal, and land).\n\n5.\n\nPreparing the Business Case\n\nThis is required in order to confirm the decision to let the project, and identify the terms of\nthe bidding in the knowledge of the likely market response; hence contact with potential bidders\nis necessary. This in-depth analysis should:\n\n\u2022 Establish the project financial structure.\n\n\u2022\n\nIdentify the nature and scale of all the project risks.\n\n\u2022 Define the balance between government support and provisions (such as defined tariffs)\n\nto secure specific government objectives.\n\n\u2022 Allocate risks between government and the concession company. Experience suggests\n\nthe allocation in Table 2 is likely to be appropriate at a general level.\n\n\u2022 Define the provisions for unforeseen events and specify the procedures for renegotiation.\n\n\u2022 Confirm that the proposed allocation of risks and government support are likely to attract\n\nserious bids.\n\n\fxiii\n\nTable 2: Risk Allocation\n\nRisk\n\nResponsibility  of\nGovernment\n\nResponsibility  of\nConcession  Company\n\nCompletion\n\u2013  Land acquisition/permissions\n\n\u2013  Design\n\n\u2013  Construction time/cost\n\nCommercial \u2013 operations and\nmaintenance  cost\nCommercial \u2013 Traffic Revenue\n\nDevaluation and Inflation\nDefault and Force Majeure\n\u2013  By Concession Company\n\n\u2013  By Government\n\n        \u00d6\n\n       \u00d6\n\n       \u00d6\n\nFinancing\n\n               (government support)\n\n          Agreed with the banks\n\n             Joint, government sharing in \u2018super-profits\u2019, and providing\n\n                 downside guarantees4\n\n\u00d6\n\u00d6\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\nThe Government should not normally be an equity holder in the project company, as the\nparties have different interests. Rather, the concession agreement should foster common views,\nby revenue sharing and provision for project extensions.\n\n6.\n\nSecuring Competitive Bids, Negotiation and Award\n\nThe basis for bidding follows directly from the business case. International marketing to\npotential investors may be necessary to maximize market interest. Success in attracting serious\nbidders requires the existence of an acceptable PSP process, realism in the balance of risks and\nrewards  offered,  confidence  in  the  Government  resulting  from  its  past  performance,  and  good\ntiming, given the external macro-economic environment.\n\nIt is necessary to establish a clear bidding and negotiating process:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe project requirements need to be specified closely, to ensure that evaluation of bids\nare equitable.\n\nThe Government support should be defined, where necessary as a maximum - rather\nthan held back for negotiation. This allows the private sector to prepare realistic bids,\nand helps to avoid failed bids.\n\nThe Government should have access to expert advice during the entire process, from\npreparation of bid documentation through to contract signature. The private sector will\nhave such advice and governments need to be equally well prepared.\n\n4      \n\nThis is likely to be particularly necessary for projects on green-field sites.\n\n\fxiv\n\n\u2022\n\nThere is merit in having simple evaluation criteria - for example, bidding at defined tariffs\nto  minimize  the  level  of  government  investment  required  since  it  gives  transparent\ndecisions.\n\n\u2022 Conforming and non-conforming bids should be allowed, in order to foster private sector\n\ninnovation.\n\nGovernment should establish whether and to what extent PSP projects achieve value-for-\nmoney, by comparing costs with the best public sector alternative. Government should also seek\nto establish, through before-and-after audits, how expectations are matched by reality - as a basis\nfor continuous improvements to the PSP process.\n\n7.\n\nSupporting Implementation and Operations\n\nGovernment should be proactive during this period, with the objective of maximizing the\nsuccess of the project. Government will administer the concession contract, and regulate on an\nagreed  basis  in  the  public  interest.  When  unforeseen  circumstances  occur,  government  must\nfollow the procedures set out in the concession agreement.\n\nD.\n\nProspects and Role for ADB\n\n1.\n\nFuture  Prospects\n\nThe potential for improvement in the roads sector is large. What may be achievable in the\nnext 5-10 years? While every situation is different, something along the following lines will often be\nsought in Asian countries:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nImprovement in the PSP environment - legal, institutional and regulatory.\n\nThe institutionalization within government of PSP procurement process and skills.\n\n\u2022 Development,  within  government,  of  an  effective  transport  strategy  and  project\n\nidentification process.\n\nImproved preparation of BOT projects, to meet the more demanding requirements of\ninvestors.\n\n\u2022 A widespread understanding, through education and application, of the different PSP\n\noptions which can be effective in the sector.\n\n\u2022 A progressive transfer of maintenance activity under performance-based management\n\ncontracts with the private sector.\n\nLooking further ahead, the direction is towards greater commercialization of the roads\nsector. It does not seem to be unrealistic to expect the main road system to be packaged\ninto  areas  or  corridors,  for  management,  maintenance  and  improvement  under\nperformance-based contracts. The contracts will be with private sector companies and\nwill have required those companies to develop new skills. This will become a major\nprivate sector industry, focused on both the implementation of new projects, and the\nmanagement of the road system.\n\n\fxv\n\n2.\n\nRole for ADB\n\nThere is widespread recognition by government technocrats and private sector players,\nthat ADB needs to be increasingly involved in this area. The government requires technical assistance\nto restructure and reshape policy, as well as funding and other support. The private sector requires\ntechnical assistance support to secure financing arrangements and to appreciate that ADB assistance\ncan help government to determine sector policy. This offers encouragement for ADB policy that\nalready exists.\n\nThe five areas for ADB assistance are to:\n\n\u2022 Prepare the environment and procurement process for PSP.\n\n\u2022 Broaden the understanding of the range of PSP options that exists in the roads sector.\nMost options are currently not applied, and they provide an undoubted opportunity, as\nexperience  elsewhere  demonstrates.  In  particular,  they  tackle  the  problems  of\nmaintenance and rehabilitation, which underlie the problems of the roads sector in most\ncountries.\n\n\u2022 Assist with transport strategy formulation. This is necessary for identifying priority PSP\nprojects. It requires coordination with other donors to create the necessary institutional\nsetting for sound strategy development, and its widespread acceptance.\n\n\u2022 Assist to identify priority projects for joint public-private funding (so-called hybrid projects).\nIt is not yet clear how the different imperatives of ADB and the private sector can best\nbe combined, when faced with an uncertain environment. Experimentation is required\nto establish how this is best achieved.\n\n\u2022\n\nInvest  in  projects  through  ADB\u2019s  public  and  private  sector  windows,  and  where\nappropriate, provide guarantees. These activities are widely recognized to leverage\nsubstantial  additional  funds  in  projects  that  ADB  has  determined  are  sound\ninvestments.\n\n\fxvi\n\n\fxvii\n\nPART ONE\n\nSTUDY OVERVIEW\n\n\fI.           INTRODUCTION\n\nAn Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance was approved with the\naim of developing sector specific best practices for promoting private sector participation (PSP)\nin  key  infrastructure  sectors  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  The  sectors\nstudied included power, water supply, roads, ports and airports and the best practices covered:\n(i) sector policy issues relating to pricing and competition; (ii) conducive legal and regulatory\nframeworks; (iii) the unbundling, mitigating, and management of risks; and (iv) mechanisms to\nreduce transaction costs. Five individual experts were engaged to undertake the study, one for\neach sector. A two-day regional workshop was held at ADB on 9-10 December 1998 for the\nexperts to present their findings and validate them with an invited group of experienced senior\ngovernment and private sector individuals, together with ADB staff. These volumes represent\nthe final outputs of the study.\n\nA  summary  of  the  expressed  views  in  these  volumes  in  relation  to  preferred  forms  of\nPSP in infrastructure, informed by the currency crisis, is that it is \u201cbest practice\u201d to have a customer\nfocus and a well structured regulatory environment around infrastructure projects, in part since\nthis can allow domestic financing. In other words, it is financially and economically sensible to\nutilize the essential and often monopoly status of efficient infrastructure services in creating, in\neffect, a customer finance model of PSP. Under this customer-focused concession or franchise\nmodel, government provides the regulatory and legal framework that can satisfy customer and\ninvestor  alike,  with  the  securitization  of  customer  accounts  (say  via  an  escrow  account)  or\ninsurance techniques underpinning financing arrangements. Investors will always seek to mitigate\nuncertainties, but many of the privatization models to date have done so by way of government\nguarantees which have undermined the process in the longer run.\n\nRegulation by entities appointed by the government is still required in the new model,\ngiven that monopoly provision of key network assets is often the only efficient option. For\nexample there is a need to regulate access charges for connection to network assets such\nas pipelines, high voltage wires and port channels. But where competition can be achieved\nin  the  product  market,  as  with  electricity  generation  selling  into  a  power  pool,  then  this\ncompetition  is  generally  the  best  mechanism  to  achieve  good  outcomes  for  customers.\nRealistically, in much of Asia, there is little experience with these new pro-competitive models\nof regulation and thus there is an expectation, on the part of the experts, of a substantial\nphase-in to this regulatory element of best practice in the future.\n\nThe challenge as we enter 2000 with its information-rich possibilities, is to learn from the\n1990s infrastructure experience on investor-to-government build-operate-transfer (BOT) deals\nand concession transactions so that DMCs can benefit from the adoption of best practices in the\nvarious infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe following presents an overview of the study, including a discussion on the growth of\nprivate  sector  infrastructure  investment  in  Asia,  a  review  of  the  cross-sectoral  issues,  a\nsummary of the sectoral best practices for each sector and suggestions on the role of ADB\nin supporting private sector investment in infrastructure. Part 2 comprises the specific sectoral\nreport.\n\n\f2\n\nII. THE GROWTH OF PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION\n\nA.\n\nExpansion and Contraction of Private Sector Investment\n\nThe last decade, and notably the period to 1996, saw both the rapid expansion of private\ninvestment in public infrastructure and a sharp increase in private management of the services\nassociated with this infrastructure. The investment was fuelled by the development of new forms of\nPSP including varying forms of public/private partnerships: BOT, build-own-operate, build-own-\noperate-transfer (BOOT), and concessions.\n\nNew  financial  instruments,  especially  project  finance,  and  the  globalization  of  private\ninvestment funds, played a major role in the expansion of the infrastructure sectors in most countries.\nPSP in infrastructure, and in particular power generation, was supported enthusiastically by the\nmultilateral development banks and bilateral development agencies, as well as by the international\nfinancial community. But fewer transactions were completed in the more complex and customer-\nfocused areas such as water, electricity distribution and transport infrastructure. Early successes\ninvolved financial transactions without major organizational restructuring; later transactions focused\non major infrastructure in mega-cities such as Manila, Jakarta and Shanghai. For example, water\ntreatment plants, bulk water supply, individual power generation units, container terminals, passenger\nterminals, and airport toll roads.\n\nIn the first half of the 1990s, investment requirements for infrastructure in Asia were\nseen to be on a scale that dwarfed earlier projections and experience. Asian tiger economies\nwere growing rapidly, and demanding massive investments in power, roads, telecommunications\nand other infrastructure. In most Asian economies, there was also a sense that development\nwas being hindered by bottlenecks in power (e.g., the Philippines), transport (e.g., Thailand),\nwater  (most  of  Asia)  and  telecommunications.  Since  government  infrastructure  spending,\ninternational aid, and official sector lending could not be on a scale sufficient to meet requirements,\nthe private sector was the focus of attention.\n\nThe new infrastructure investment requirements were estimated by ADB to be of the order\nof US$1,000 billion for the 1 990s for East Asia. Subsequently, they were estimated by the World\nBank to be of the order of US$1,500 billion for the decade 1995 to 2004. Such projections were\nuseful as a means of highlighting the scale and structure of the huge infrastructure requirements\nof a growing and increasingly prosperous and urbanized Asia. They helped make clear the need\nfor a major shift of focus towards PSP in infrastructure, to some extent motivated by efficiency\nconsiderations,  but  mainly  reflecting  the  view  that  public  sector  financing  for  this  scale  of\ninfrastructure requirements was neither feasible nor desirable.\n\nThere had also been a shift in views as to the comparative advantages of governments\nand the private sector in performing the various roles related to the provision of quality infrastructure\nservices. Increasingly, an expanded regulatory and restructuring role was seen for governments,\nwith investment, construction, financing, and management viewed as best opened to competitive\nPSP. Risks should, under this approach, be assigned to the parties best able to mitigate them,\nand this meant a greatly expanded role for the private sector.\n\nThere was recognition that while many private sector investments of the BOT type were\nbeing  completed,  the  assignment  of  risks  in  many  of  these  projects  left  much  to  be  desired.\nGovernment guarantees of bulk take-or-pay contracts (between utilities and investors), often\n\n\f3\n\nindexed to exchange rates, had created huge contingent financial obligations of the utilities and\ntheir governments.\n\nAs  with  many  investment trends,  optimism,  a  proliferation  of  Memoranda  of  Understanding\nand  glossy  investment  announcements  gradually  replaced  careful  evaluation.  Some  early\nsuccesses, under special circumstances, led to the assumption that this BOT approach could\nbe universally applied. The expression BOT had become a shorthand for PSP in many countries\nby the mid 1 990s; but by 1999 BOTs and often the associated power purchasing agreements\nhad also become a shorthand for unacceptable government risk exposure, and of project isolation\nfrom customer and market pressures.\n\nThis optimism ended with the Asian financial crisis; itself brought on by a lack of sound\ninvestment  policies,  in  particular,  in  relation  to  government  guaranteed  power  purchasing\nagreements.  The  power  purchasing  agreements  had  inadvertently  converted  a  shortage  of\npower supply into an oversupply, secured by take-or-pay guarantees. The result of the crisis\nhas  been  a  sharp  contraction  in  private  sector  investment  and  a  significant  exposure  of\ngovernment and private sector investors to contingent liabilities. This contraction not only limits\nthe capacity of governments to stimulate economic growth but also has led to the deterioration\nor stagnation of many partially completed and privately financed public infrastructure projects.\nThe rise and fall of private sector finance is clearly shown in the private finance data presented\nin Box 1.\n\nThe currency crisis has caused some dramatic revisions both to economic growth forecasts\nand to infrastructure investment programs. However, as the analysis in Box 1 shows that while\nforecasts for infrastructure are lower due to lower growth and the expected move to best practice,\nthe magnitude of investment is still huge and efficient PSP will be required.\n\nB.\n\nThe  Challenge  for  Private  Sector  Infrastructure  Investment\n\nAs this difficult period unwinds, it is important to re-consider the comparative advantages of\nthe public and private sectors and the critical role of improved regulation and governance \u2014\nincluding transparency, enforcement of contracts, and the adoption of viable commercial tariff\nstructures. There is a need to review, sector by sector, the strengths and weaknesses of the\nprocess that has been used to implement these investments. The opportunities and risks of new\napproaches need to be addressed \u2013 e.g., the case for expanding the emphasis on customer\nfocused and privately managed concessions. There is a need to develop bankable versions of\nthese  models,  ideally  backed  by  the  security  of  customer  accounts  rather  than  government\nguarantees  or  public  sector  assurances.  This  series  of  volumes  addresses  these  and  other\nsectoral best practice concerns.\n\nThere are major challenges for governments and investors alike, emerging from this shift\nto a new model for infrastructure development. The new best practice model does not mean a\ntotal retreat by governments; on the contrary, moving to best or better practice involves a shift to\ngood governance, and requires an upgrade of regulatory, restructuring, and monitoring roles.\nWithout  greatly  improved  governance,  the  shift  to  increased  PSP  could  just  mean  monopoly\npowers being shifted to the well connected in the private sector. Moreover, without improved\ngovernance, PSP would eventually flounder and the demands for infrastructure will not be met,\nas risks would become unacceptable.\n\n\fBox 1: Past Project Finance and Future Infrastructure Demand \u2014 East Asia\n\nFuture Demand for Infrastructure Investment\n\nFigure 2:\n1996-2005 Infrastructure Investment Projections\n\nFigure 1:\nProject Finance\n\nEnergy\n\nTelecoms\n\nTransport\n\nWater\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\nYEAR\n\nScenario\n\nBaseline\n\nCase  1\n\nCase  2\n\nUS$ trillion\n\n1.78\n\n1.53\n\n1.37\n\n%\n\n100\n\n86\n\n77\n\nProject Finance \u2014 Opportunity and Volatility\n\n      Figure  1  draws  on  a  Euromoney  (Capital DATA)\ndatabase  and  highlights  the  dramatic  growth,  and\nsubsequent  decline  of  infrastructure  funded  through  project\nfinance in selected East Asian countries. The pre-crisis level\nof  nearly  US$41  billion  for  1996,  contrasts  sharply  with  the\nestimated level at the end of the 1980s, when the total market\nfor  funding  projects  was  less  than  US$5  billion  per  annum,\nas  well  as  with  the  crisis  figure  of  US$12  billion  for  1998.\nclearly, in the 1990s and well prior to the crisis, the importance\nof the private sector in infrastructure  development was rapidly\nincreasing. As a result of the crisis, the telecommunications\nsector  has  shown  the  most  dramatic  decline,  reflecting  the\nfact  that  such  projects  are  typically  purely  privately  funded,\nand  bear  demand  risk  in  a  newly  open  environment.  The\nenergy projects, on the other hand, appear more resilient, but\nmainly  because  they  have  had  some  form  of  government\nsupport,  in  the  form  of  guarantees  in  relation  to  bulk  sales\nthrough PPAs.\n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nb\n \n$\nS\nU\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nNew  infrastructure  projections  for  selected  East  Asian\ncountries:  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  china  (PRc);  Indonesia;\nRepublic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  Philippines;  and  Thailand  for\nthe period 1996-2005, adjusted to allow for both the phase-in\nof private sector market discipline/best practices and reduced\neconomic  growth.  The  revised  projections  are  23  percent\nbelow  the  pre-crisis  (baseline)  projections.  They  are  based\non establishing the value of the capital stock of infrastructure\nin each country and projecting infrastructure investments with\nvarying  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  assumptions\nand varying infrastructure-to-output ratios. A summary is given\nin Figure 2. The pre-crisis projections are based on the 1996\nGDP growth forecasts. Case 1 is based on the current GDP\ngrowth forecasts while Case 2 adds the impact of a transition\nto a lower infrastructure-to-output ratio and assumes a gradual\n25 percent increase in efficiency in each sector in each country.\nAn important factor to note in the projections for this region is\nthat the PRC is assumed to maintain its relatively high GDP\ngrowth  rate,  which  accounts  for  about  two  thirds  of  the\ninfrastructure spending in the region. The results for Case 1\nindicate a fall of 14 percent from the pre-crisis projections. If\nthe  PRC  is  excluded,  the  reduction  is  33  percent.  Case  2,\nwhich assumes a transition to best practices, with a resulting\nchange in the underlying infrastructure-to-output and efficiency\nparameters, indicates further reductions in the level of needed\ninvestments.  The  analysis  clearly  shows  the  relative  impact\nof lower growth and the potential benefits of moving to best\npractice  models  of  infrastructure  development.  It  also\nhighlights  the  magnitude  of  investment  requirements,  in\nexcess of $120 billion per year, and the need for PSP.\n\nSource: \u201cPrivate Sector Participation and Infrastructure Investment in Asia\u201d, Asian  Development  Bank  paper  prepared  for  the\nFinance Ministers Meeting, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, May, 1999; prepared by M.G Porter and C. McKinlay (Macquarie\nBank and Tasman Asia Pacific).\n\n\f5\n\nIII.\n\nCROSS-SECTORAL  ISSUES  FOR  PRIVATE  SECTOR  PARTICIPATION\n\nThere are a number of cross-sectoral issues relating to promoting private sector investment\nin infrastructure that were identified during the study. The review of best practices in each of the five\nsectors highlighted the importance of competition, transparent tendering, and effective regulation.\nThere was broad agreement that:\n\n\u2022 Government  should  specialize  in  planning,  structuring,  and  regulation  while  the\nprivate  sector  should  specialize  in  management,  investment,  construction,  and\nfinancing;\n\n\u2022\n\nThe transfer of responsibility to the private sector should be accomplished through\nderegulation  and  open  competition  or  well-established  contractual  arrangements\nincluding  management  contracts,  capital  leases,  concessions,  sale  of  assets  and\nrights to operate;\n\n\u2022 Economic  regulation  should  be  applied  where  there  is  insufficient  competition  but  it\nshould be transparent and predictable while still accommodating the concerns of the\naffected parties;\n\n\u2022\n\nLong-term domestic financing sources must be developed; and\n\n\u2022 Commercial risks should be assigned to the private sector but other risks should be\n\nassigned according to which party is able to mitigate the risks.\n\nThe cross-sectoral issues are discussed in more detail below.\n\nA.\n\nThe Need for Reform and Role of Government\n\nPSP in infrastructure development still requires the government to play a key role in planning,\npolicy, and regulation. The reason that infrastructure industries have remained so long in the public\nsector is that they have components that are natural monopolies; e.g., the costs are lower with only\none provider and the services are often essential (water, power and transport). These infrastructure\nmonopolies also typically have a relatively high proportion of capital costs, have long-lived assets\nwith low unit variable costs, and exhibit significant economies of scale. It had been a common\njudgement that state ownership of such monopolies, rather than state regulation of privately owned\nassets, was likely to deliver the best outcomes.\n\nExisting  service  providers  in  these  infrastructure  areas  have  also  had  a  considerable\ncompetitive advantage over potential new entrants, because of the relatively long time required\nto construct expensive new networks and to build up the market for their services. The scarcity\nof  land,  rights-of-way  and  airspace  suitable  for  development  of  the  network  also  act  as  an\nadditional barrier to competition. Sites for airports and seaports, dams, power plants, and rightsof-\nway  for  roads,  rail  lines  and  transmission  systems  had  become  increasingly  difficult  to\nacquire. Another common argument for retaining these industries within the public sector was\nthat they must provide common (or universal) access to their services and that subsidies are\nrequired.\n\n\f6\n\nIt turns out that public ownership and management is neither necessary, nor the best way\nto ensure universal access. Subsidies can easily be a requirement of a competitive tender or\ncan be directly financed by government. A key advantage of having the private sector provide\npublic  services  is  that  it  allows  public  administrators  to  concentrate  on  planning,  policy  and\nregulation. The private sector, in turn, is empowered to do what it does best (i) invest capital; (ii)\nmanage the businesses; (iii) manage and create appropriate incentives for staff and management;\n(iv) deal with customers; and (v) improve the efficiency and quality of service; more recently,\nunder the spur of benchmark competition - competition by comparison.\n\nGovernments  should  allow  the  private  sector  to  provide  infrastructure  services  to  the\nmaximum extent possible, with governments concentrating on planning, policy and regulation,\nand with the private sector on efficiently investing capital and improving the efficiency and quality\nof such services.\n\nB.\n\nInstitutional Reform\n\nThe  organization  of  the  infrastructure  sectors  (i.e.,  ministries,  regulatory  agencies,  and\nutilities)  has  remained  largely  unchanged  with  the  introduction  of  PSP.  With  financial\ntransactions being the primary mechanism for transferring infrastructure services to the private\nsector, insufficient attention has been given to the broader issue of institutional reforms. It has\nbeen  implicitly  assumed  that  the  introduction  of  private  management  into  the  ownership  or\noperation of specific assets would obviate the need for such reforms. Instead, the weaknesses\nof existing institutional structures have limited the effectiveness of the private sector initiatives. In\nmost countries, the piecemeal transfer of infrastructure components has proceeded slowly and\nthe  controlling  bureaucracies  that  add  overhead  costs  and  often  limit  improvements  in\ninfrastructure  performance,  have  remained  relatively  unaffected.  The  currency  crisis  has\nemphasized the importance of institutional reforms but government bureaucracies rarely reform\nthemselves. Governments should carefully review the structure, size and responsibilities of state-\nowned utilities and other entities in the infrastructure sectors and establish special reform units\nreporting directly to top level ministers to spearhead the necessary reforms.\n\nC.\n\nStrategic Planning\n\nGovernments\u2019 acceptance of private sector investment in infrastructure has been due, in\npart, to their failure to anticipate future bottlenecks and make timely strategic investments to\nprevent  shortages  in  capacity.  The  increased  role  of  the  private  sector  in  developing\ninfrastructure has caused many governments to neglect their responsibility for sector planning.\nInstead, governments have offered assets and public services to the private sector in an ad hoc\nmanner,  often  failing  to  ensure  that  individual  investments  were  complementary.  In  certain\ncircumstances, unsolicited proposals have been used as a surrogate for planning. For its part,\nthe private sector has selected projects that had already been identified in government plans,\ngiving preference to those which offered the highest rate of return, the lowest risk or the greatest\nshort-term benefit. The private sector has had neither the interest nor the capacity to consider\nthe network implications of its proposals. Governments have failed to subject these proposals\nto rigorous financial analysis to determine their sustainability in the absence of major increases\nin  user  charges  or  government  guarantees.  Governments  have  also  often  overlooked  the\ncomplementary investment required from the public sector to make the private investments\nsuccessful.  The  results  have  been unsolicited proposals that involved little commercial risk\n(government guarantees, wrap-around provisions, transfer of existing assets, granting select\n\n\f7\n\nrights of way) or politically generated proposals. Governments should maintain and strengthen\ntheir role in strategic planning of the infrastructure sectors and in the process identify where\nPSP should be encouraged and the level of complementary support that should be provided.\n\nD.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework\n\nThe effectiveness of PSP has suffered from the lack of adequate regulatory structures to\ncontrol both technical and economic performance. Regulation of tariffs and other economic\nfactors  is  particularly  undeveloped.  The  basic  objectives  of  autonomy,  accountability,\ntransparency and predictability have been difficult to achieve. More importantly, the mechanism\nfor consultation between the public and private sector and for dispute resolution between the\nproviders and users of the network has not been fully developed. A further problem has been\nthe failure to separate regulation from administration in order to avoid conflicts of interest. Most\ncountries have been slow to establish autonomous regulatory agencies with independent funding\nand professional staff.\n\nUnbundling the network into competitive and monopolistic components can significantly\nreduce  the  need  for  regulation.  The  competitive  components  can  be  transferred  to  the  private\nsector in a way that promotes competition and allows deregulation. The monopolistic components\ncan then be transferred to the private sector once an effective regulatory framework has been\nestablished. This regulation should create a situation where the businesses derive their profits\nfrom increased efficiency and the attraction of additional demand.\n\nEffective economic regulation covers also deterrence of anti-competitive practices. Most of\nthe developing countries lack laws or agencies for dealing with anti-competitive practices. Economic\nactivity continues to be concentrated in large conglomerates. The currency crisis has provided\nnew impetus for breaking up the monopolies and introducing anti-monopoly laws.\n\nThe lack of established legal and regulatory procedures applies to contract law as well. The\nmeans for enforcement of contracts and the resolution of disputes are not well established. Political\ninterference in the award of contracts has also been a problem.\n\nPSP without a well-developed legal and regulatory framework increases the level of risk to\ninvestors. It also encourages investors to rely on special situations and political relationships rather\nthan their merits as a means for securing and implementing contracts. The transfer of infrastructure\nservices to the private sector should not lead to privileged deals or profits secured by government\nguarantees. They should be businesses with regulated income streams which derive their profits\nfrom increased efficiency and the attraction of additional demand. These income streams should\nbe capable of securing substantial private sector funding, both because their semi-regulated nature\nmakes them much like a government bond, and because the essential and often monopoly nature\nof the service lowers demand risk. Such assets are also long-lived and thus attractive to pension\nand similar long-term funds.\n\nE.\n\nUnbundling and Introducing Competition\n\nExperience in a number of countries has shown that unbundled infrastructure sectors\nwith  individual  components  managed  separately  can  perform  better  than  centrally-controlled\nnetworks.  The  additional  costs  of  unbundled  networks  due  to  increased  communications  and\n\n\f8\n\ntransactions among components have been reduced by improvements in technology. At the same\ntime, the unbundled management has been able to better focus on the capacity and productivity of\nthe individual components and their interface with other components.\n\nThe unbundling of the infrastructure sectors is an important technique for reducing their\nnatural monopoly and promoting competition. Many parts of the network can support competition.\nWhere it is not possible to create direct competition between suppliers of network services, it is\noften  possible  to  create  competition  among  providers  of  complementary  network  services.  For\nexample,  in  the  power  sector,  many  countries  are  separating  the  networks  into  generation,\ntransmission, distribution, and in some cases, a fourth segment responsible for retailing power to\ncustomers, with different companies responsible for each segment.\n\nWhere  competition  cannot  be  created,  it  is  often  possible  to  establish  contestable\nenvironments  e.g.,  a  market  for  the  business.  One  method  is  through  effective  competitive\nbidding for the sale or lease of assets and licensing or franchising of services. Another is to\nreduce  the  period  of  the  contractual  agreements  or  to  provide  for  a  periodic  review  of\nperformance. A third is to introduce performance targets related to the quality of the service,\nthe range of services, the prices charged for the services and overall market share. The ability\nof the private sector to achieve these targets is then linked to penalties, or provisions that may\nlead to early termination of the agreement. A fourth method is to require comparable performance\nvis-a-vis other networks. This may be in the form of requirements for increasing market share\nrelative to other providers of similar services, or requiring a quality of service and price that is\ncomparable to other networks serving similar markets.\n\nMost  infrastructure  sectors  are  composed  of  profitable  and  unprofitable  components.\nOne practical, but not ideal, strategy for transferring the components to the private sector is to\nbundle profitable and unprofitable components to produce a combination that has an acceptable\nlevel of profitability. Another is to tender the profitable components through techniques ranging\nfrom operating agreements and franchising to sales of assets and to transfer the unprofitable\ncomponents using management contracts; in effect, bidding out the government support for that\ncomponent. A third strategy has been to transfer the profitable components to the private sector\nand to retain the unprofitable components in the public sector, but under control of local government\nunits rather than the national government.\n\nF.\n\nSources of Financing\n\nPrivate  sector  funding  of  infrastructure  usually  brings  the  risk  of  foreign  currency\nmismatches  in  the  financing  package;  income  is  in  local  currency,  but  the  need  to  resort  to\nforeign debt and equity markets means that debt service requires substantial foreign currency.\nThe root problem is inadequate depth in capital markets in most DMCs which prevents a tailoring\nof local currency debt to long-lived assets. The need to resort to foreign debt (and equity) creates\nsubstantial risks, which have been exposed in the recent crisis. Few infrastructure consortia can\nwithstand an exchange rate depreciation of 40 to 50 percent, let alone the 80 percent decline\nexperienced  in  Indonesia  when  their  product  is  sold  for  local  currency.  Hence  the  priority  on\nprograms to deepen the domestic capital market.\n\nIn  principle,  currency  matching  requires  that  the  bulk  of  debt  funding  of  infrastructure\nservices such as transport, water supply, electricity and other urban services should be in local\ncurrency. In the absence of the necessary capital market reforms, it is hard to see how private\n\n\f9\n\nsector  provision  of  infrastructure  can  proceed  on  the  scale  required  to  meet  future  demand.  A\npriority, therefore, given the recent experiences, is that international development agencies such\nas ADB expand their role both in facilitating political risk insurance and in fostering the development\nof domestic capital markets in Asia, particularly bond markets.\n\nDirect foreign investment will remain an important source of funds for the development of\nthe infrastructure sectors. However, it will take time to restore investor confidence and, given the\nexperience of Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea and others, governments will\nnaturally seek to limit their exposure to these funds in preference to local sources of capital, if\npossible. The development of domestic long-term capital markets will be critical for private sector\ninvestment in infrastructure, but these markets must have much better regulation as well.\n\nG.\n\nRisk and Risk Mitigation\n\nIn order to reach financial closure, governments have often accepted commercial risks\nthat should have been assigned to the private sector. This includes not only the foreign exchange\nrisk but also demand/traffic (volume) risk. The most obvious example has been the take-or-\npay  provisions  in  power  purchase  agreements.  These  guarantees  have  had  three  negative\nimpacts. First, they have isolated the private sponsors from the influences of the market. Second,\nthey have created a large amount of contingent liabilities for governments that now add to their\nfiscal problems. Third, they have encouraged price rigidity leading to distortions in the market\nand  reducing  the  potential  of  the  private  sector  to  improve  efficiencies  in  investment  and\noperations. Other examples are build-lease-transfer agreements and volume guarantees for\ntoll roads, airports and seaports.\n\nBecause governments have had limited contract-related knowledge or experience, the private\nparties have been frequently able to convince them to assume some of the commercial risks. Also,\nbecause governments have often not been able to engage suitable legal, technical and financial\nexperts to assist during negotiations, they have been at a disadvantage in arguing with foreign\nproponents concerning international practices such as take-or-pay contracts, or with international\nlenders concerning guarantees to protect their loans. Bureaucrats who have gone through a long,\noften  contentious  bidding  process  have  been  willing  to  accept  some  commercial  risks  during\nnegotiations rather than to face rebidding. Alternatively, private parties frustrated with drawn out\nnegotiations  and the  continuing  renegotiating of clauses have accepted risks that should have\nbeen borne by the government.\n\nGovernments  should  build  up  capacity  to  negotiate  and  deal  with  the  private  sector.\nCommercial risks should be assigned to the private sector and other risks should be assigned to\nthe party best able to mitigate them.\n\nIV.         SUMMARY OF SECTORAL BEST PRACTICES\n\nThe  challenge  for  governments  is  to  encourage  an  appropriate  form  of  private  sector\ninvestment  in  infrastructure.  The  study  has  identified  significant  differences  among  the\ninfrastructure  sectors  concerning  the  appropriate  balance  between  private  and  public\nparticipation in ownership of assets and provision of services. Only some of the sectors have\nwell defined models for PSP. Other best practices are still evolving and the menu will continue\nto develop as experience grows. The decisions on which infrastructure components should be\n\n\f10\n\ntransferred  to  the  private  sector  are  of  a  strategic  nature.  They  depend  not  only  on  the\ncharacteristics of the sector and the market it serves but also on government objectives. There\nwas  consensus  among  the  experts  that  the  primary  objective  should  be  to  benefit  consumers.\nHowever there were a number of additional objectives which governments should consider:\n(i)  reduction  in  national  debt;  (ii)  stimulation  of  domestic  capital  markets;  (iii)  reduction  in\ncapital and operating subsidies; (iv) investment in new infrastructure or rehabilitation of existing\ninfrastructure; (v) improvements in the quality of service; (vi) increased range of services;\n(vii)  reduced  prices  for  services;  (viii)  client-oriented  operations;  and  (ix)  more  effective\nmarketing.\n\nGovernments  have  at  their  disposal  a  number  of  means  for  effecting  the  transfer  of\ninfrastructure  components  to  the  private  sector.  The  pace  and  sequence  of  such  a  transfer\ndepends on the: (I) size and complexity of the infrastructure sector; (ii) rate of growth in demand\nand the competitiveness of the market; (iii) options for unbundling by function or geography; (iv)\nlegal regime regarding ownership of land and other critical assets; and (v) capacity for economic\nregulation. The established mechanisms, which range from management contracts to unregulated\ncompetition, are not new and have proven effective. The key is to have a vision of where the\nsector is going, and to carry through the reforms as quickly as possible so as not to allow the\ninterim change to become the final state of affairs. The findings of the sectoral experts for each\nsector are summarized below.\n\nA.\n\nPower\n\nIn the electricity sector, IPPs provided a quick solution (in the Philippines, for example) by\noffering generation capacity needed for rapid economic growth. However, the costs were often\nhigh  because  the  new  capacity  was  not  consistent  with  the  least-cost  expansion  path  and  the\nprivate sector required high rates of return. However, these costs have been decreasing as the IPP\nmarket has matured. The focus on production rather than efficient distribution put the public sector\nin the position of retaining that activity in which it was least effective and restricting the private\nsector from performing the customer focused activities (distribution and supply) where it had real\nexpertise. At the same time, it isolated the private sector from the market through a combination of\nregulated pricing and guarantees against commercial risks.\n\nThe power sector expert advocates restructuring to achieve a competitive market model\nwith wholesale and retail competition. Such reform will encourage sustainable PSP and maximize\nthe  benefits  to  consumers.  The  expert  suggests  five  major  steps  in  implementing  this\napproach, and their order of precedence. To some extent, these steps may proceed in parallel,\nbut they should be considered sequential actions that will lead to the implementation of a\ncompetitive power market:\n\n1. Getting the investment framework right.\n2. Deciding on the goals of restructuring and the ideal industry structure.\n3. Preparing the players to participate in a competitive market.\n4. Privatizing existing and new assets.\n5. Ensuring that the competitive market is implemented properly.\n\n\f11\n\nBest practices for power sector restructuring would include the following:\n\n\u2022 Create an enabling legal and regulatory environment to support competitive markets in\n\nelectricity.\n\n\u2022 Unbundle  the power  sector into separate generation, transmission, distribution,  and\n\npossibly retailing sectors to achieve the maximum benefits for customers.\n\n\u2022 Privatization should include the sale of power distribution utilities as well as generation,\nand  should  include  existing  assets  as  well  as  new  projects,  using  a  transparent\nprocess.\n\n\u2022 Open  access  to  transmission  and  distribution  wires,  and  the  ability  to  trade  power\nbetween buyers and sellers in an open market, are critical to achieve a competitive\nframework.\n\n\u2022 Operate  the  generation  and  retailing  markets  competitively,  with  a  large  number  of\ngenerators selling into a wholesale electricity market at prices which balance demand\nand supply throughout the day.\n\n\u2022 Operate  the  transmission  network  as  a  concession  on  the  basis  of  competitive\nbidding, or privatize it within a tight regulatory framework, controlling rates of return,\nprices or gross revenue.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe independent regulator should mainly oversee prices and incentives for transmission\nand distribution operations.\n\n\u2022 Restructuring  should  proceed  at  a  pace  consistent  with  the  development  of  a\n\ncompetitive and unbundled system.\n\nB.\n\nWater\n\nThe water sector has moved more slowly towards private sector investment, relative to\nelectricity  and  telecommunications  for  example,  not  least  because  of  the  jurisdictional,\nenvironmental and sensitive social concerns about water supply, and its affordability. While major\nprivate  sector i nvolvement  has  now  been  achieved  in  distribution  (Manila and Jakarta),  the\nbulk of transactions were BOT models with take-or-pay clauses guaranteed by governments.\nAdding to these difficulties was the lack of knowledge about the location and condition of the\n(underground) networks and aquifers in many countries.\n\nThe  volume  on  the  water  supply  sector  addresses  the  question  of  why,  given  the\nalternatives,  the  private  sector  should  seek  to  invest  in  a  sector  with  so  many  uncertainties,\nnatural, governmental and financial. Water, unevenly supplied as rainfall, is often wrongly deemed\na free public good, despite the costs of treatment and retail supply. Thus, there is often an ill-\ninformed community constraint against private sector involvement in water supply, which in most\ncountries has prevented the sorts of best practice referred to in this report.\n\nThe water expert makes the point that when it comes to best practice in the case of\nwater supply, most of the messages are for government \u2014 to install sound and independent\nregulatory regimes, catchment management policies and enforceable laws on tariff setting and\ncollections.  Once  in  place,  best  practices  such  as  water  supply  concessions  can  be\n\n\f12\n\nimplemented. If not in place, then best feasible practice may simply relate to contracting out some\nservices  under  government  guarantee,  or  BOOT  bulk  supply  to  public  sector  water  supply\ncompanies. It follows from this that since the particular features of the water supply situation and\nregulatory and privatization policies differ greatly across countries, so, too, will the feasible best\npractice.\n\nOne  misunderstanding  regarding  the  scope  for  bringing  commercial  practices  to  water\nsupply is the issue of affordability. The report notes that the poor often pay more for water than the\ncost from efficient commercial piped supplies. Experience has shown that low-income families will\npay for quality water supply \u2013 and are not averse to PSP \u2013 it it delivers.\n\nThe key points recommended were:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe benefits of PSP in the water sector must be explained to win public acceptance.\n\nThe  starting  point  in  any  reform  process  for  water  supply  is  to  form  a  high-level\nreform unit to drive and manage the process. It would be responsible for coordinating\nand  facilitating  the  entire  reform  and  PSP  process.  The  reform  unit  may  be  a\ncrosssectoral  unit.\n\n\u2022 While not essential to commence reform, the introduction of tradable water rights leads\n\nto efficient use of water, particularly when it is scarce and has alternative uses.\n\nThe  water  sector  should  be  unbundled  to  the  extent  possible.  The  private  sector\nconcession model is most likely to achieve the greatest benefits to the community and\nthe  economy  as  a  whole.  The  government  continues  to  own  the  network  while  the\nprivate operators lease the long-term right to use the assets and collect revenue from\nservice delivery. The benefits accrue due to strong financial incentives to reduce water\nlosses and expand service.\n\nIf politically difficult, then the next best strategy is to use BOT, BOOT, and rehabilitate-\noperate-transfer arrangements to bring expertise and finance to urgently required water\nsupply projects. The bidding procedure should be carefully managed to ensure reasonable\ncost and the contractual arrangements should not constrain subsequent progression\nto more competitive models.\n\n\u2022 Commercialization/corporatization of water supply utilities together with tariff reform is\n\nadvantageous as an interim step if the introduction of PSP is to be phased.\n\n\u2022\n\nTariff reform to achieve full cost recovery is essential for PSP. Cross-subsidies for the\npoor can still be considered in a transparent manner.\n\n\u2022 Critical to the success of PSP in the water supply sector is for the government to create\nsound  and  independent  regulatory  regimes,  catchment  management  policies,  and\nenforceable laws on tariff setting and collection.\n\n\u2022 Risks are likely to vary between countries and even between different water utilities in a\ncountry. They should be managed by the party best able to minimize and manage each\nrisk most effectively. Where no party has a clear comparative advantage to manage the\nrisk, it should be shared.\n\n\f13\n\nC.\n\nRoads\n\nIn Asia\u2019s roads sector, PSP has been equated with major BOT toll roads. These have been\ntargeted where traffic is greatest \u2013 in and near the capital city and sometimes along major inter-city\ncorridors. This private  investment  has produced some successes but also many failures. After\nmore than a decade of concerted effort, implementation experience has not matched expectations.\nIndeed, surprisingly little has been implemented outside the PRC.\n\nThe road sector expert has advanced three reasons for modest progress in roads. First,\ngovernments  have  not  defined  their  policy,  often  leaving  the  private  sector  to  identify  projects.\nSecondly, almost everyone involved has expected such toll roads to be profitable without government\nsupport, but this has only rarely proved to be the case (outside the dense PRC market, which is\ndeemed  a  \u2018special  case\u2019).  Thirdly,  it  has  proved  difficult  to  introduce  promised  tariffs  and  tariff\nincreases in a sector where roads have become to be regarded as free.\n\nWhat is clear is that private construction and maintenance of public roads produced better\nresults where there was adequate competition and effective methods for enforcing contracts. Efforts\nto substitute private sector management for public sector officials in the management of the public\nnetwork are in their early stages, even in the developed economies, but the preliminary results are\nencouraging.\n\nWorldwide experience identifies a broad range of PSP modalities, in which BOT is close to\nbeing the most difficult to implement. Other modalities include maintenance management contracts,\nturnkey, operate, and maintain or rehabilitate-operate-transfer concessions. Many of these modalities\ntarget improved maintenance, and rehabilitation of the network (rather than solely network capacity\nexpansion). They have potentially much greater application than BOT projects. Looking ahead, the\nrequirements are to both improve the BOT process, and to extend the modalities that are applied.\nThe key points to emerge are:\n\n\u2022 Governments  must  prepare  the  PSP  environment.  Institutions  may  need  to  be\nrestructured with the objectives of controlling the PSP process in the public interest,\nand creating a regulatory body, separate from vested interests. A sound legal framework\nand a predictable regulatory regime are essential.\n\n\u2022 Governments must identify priority PSP projects. This will almost always require\nan independent feasibility study, which focuses on traffic and tariff policy, project\nstaging,  network  integration  issues,  risk  allocation,  finance  and  implementation\nissues.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  best  prospects  for  BOT  projects  are  in  middle-income  countries  (where  the\nwillingness-to-pay tolls exist) along existing congested corridors, or where there are\nmissing links (e.g., estuarial/river crossings). A regulated income stream from a tolled\npublic toll road is capable of securing project financing of an appropriate kind (i.e., suitable\nto pension funds and other long-term investor groups).\n\n\u2022 Private  sector  modalities  other  than  BOT  exist,  e.g.,  concessions,  and  should  be\napplied more widely, as they can address many of the sector problems, and in the\nprocess create a new high growth industry for transport management companies.\n\n\f14\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTraffic risk is the major risk and may be shared. The core risk being taken by the private\nsector, with government taking a share of the upside benefit and providing a downside\nguarantee in the event of low traffic.\n\nTransparency and competition are essential in the procurement process.\n\n\u2022 Government support should be defined upfront as a maximum so that the private\n\nsector can prepare realistic bids.\n\nD.\n\nPorts\n\nIn the port sector, the transfer of cargo-handling activities to the private sector has been,\nin  most  cases,  extremely  successful  in  replacing  inefficient  government  bureaucracy  with\ncommercially-oriented  management.  Improvements  in  productivity  and  maintenance  has\nincreased the quality of service. However, where there was no competition, these arrangements\nwere  less  likely  to  sustain  these  improvements.  Private  investment  in  port  infrastructure  has\ngenerally been limited to new and existing cargo terminals. Trans-shipment terminals were the\nmost  successful,  since  they  were  less  dependent  on  local  markets  and  land  transport.\nGreenfield ports were slower to develop because they were further from their markets and the\ntransport  access  was  less  developed.  Basic  infrastructure  offered  few  opportunities  for  full\ncost recovery.\n\nThe ports sector expert, noted that the private sector has always been actively involved in\nport affairs. The land and water transport services that use the port are almost entirely private\nsector. Nearly all of the cargo shipped through ports is privately owned. The private sector provides\nan array of complementary trade facilitation and logistics services for this cargo. Within the confines\nof  the  public  port,  cargo  owners,  forwarders,  and  ship  agents  actively  participate  in  decisions\nconcerning the handling and storage of cargo. The public sector\u2019s role is to own, develop, and\nmanage basic port infrastructure and common-user facilities.\n\nThe  process  of  port  privatization  has  rarely  involved  pure  privatization,  since  land  and\ninfrastructure are rarely sold. Instead, the process involves PSP in operations and investment in\nequipment  and  facilities.  The  process  is  not  a  monolithic  effort  because  of  the  diversity  and\ncomplexity of ports and the services they provide. It can be divided into three components: (i)\ninstitutional reform, (ii) divestiture of existing services and assets, and (iii) investment in new\nfacilities and services. These can be implemented individually or in combination. For each port\ncomponent, there are many possible public-private partnerships. The main points regarding moves\nto best practice were:\n\nThe bidding process should encourage unbundling not only of the network but also for\nthe services within the ports. Where ports are not financially viable, they should\nnot be bundled with profitable ports, but treated as stand-alone facilities that are\nturned  over  to  local  government  or  put  under  management  contract  using  a\ncompetitive tender.\n\nThe  landlord  model  is  the  best  structure  for  promoting  PSP  because  it\naccommodates different forms of public-private partnership while recognizing that\nthe only fixed responsibility of the public port is the ownership of the site.\n\n\f15\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe most effective and efficient procedure for promoting PSP in the port sector is to\nlease existing facilities with relatively short-term agreements that allow for reorganization\nand improvement in productivity. Subsequently, concession agreements can be used\nto encourage private investment in additional capacity. Where this capacity is required\nimmediately,  or  labor  problems  make  it  difficult  to  lease  out  existing  facilities,  then\nconcessions might precede lease agreements.\n\n\u2022 Continued public investment will be required, as it is difficult to recover the costs for\nbasic infrastructure in a time period reasonable to the private sector. Public investment\nmay also be required to reduce the barriers to entry. This is important where a new\nentrant would otherwise have to make a large investment before competing with existing\nservice providers.\n\nThe best form of tariff regulation is market regulation; the second best is through the\nterms  of  the  contract  that  identify  the  non-competitive  services  requiring  regulation,\nstate the maximum rates, the formulae for escalating these rates over time, and the\narbitration procedures for discriminatory behavior in excess of that justified by commercial\npricing. The third best is the establishment of a regulatory agency outside of the port\nwhich would apply a pricing formula related to cost recovery. All of these are preferable\nto a vague procedure for negotiating future changes in tariffs.\n\nThe private sector should assume all commercial risks. Other risks should be negotiated,\nbased on which party has the capability to mitigate the risk.\n\nThe critical element in any effort to promote PSP is competition, or at least the potential\nfor competition. This can be provided through direct competition between private sector\nservice providers, between public and private service providers or between bidders in\nthe case of an activity that does not allow competition.\n\nE. Airports\n\nFor the airport sector, PSP in terminal operations produced significant improvements in\nfinancial  performance  and  the  quality  of  service.  Private  sector  investments  have  increased\nsubstantially  over  the  last  five  years.  During  the  previous  twenty  years,  there  was  little  capital\ninvestment in airports, despite a five-fold increase in traffic. The airports coped with the higher\nlevels of traffic through a combination of larger aircraft, better air traffic control, improved runway\ndesign, and the addition of second runways and additional terminal space. This period has now\nended and most countries need to invest in new airports. These are proving to be costly, complex\nand often controversial investments.\n\nThe key policy questions concern how best to structure airports and groups of airports to\nobtain  maximum  customer  benefits.  The  discussion  in  the  volume  on  airports  and  air  traffic\ncontrols indicates that there is little evidence of significant scale benefits flowing from multiple\nairport operation; equally, however, there is little evidence of significant scale diseconomies.\nThe  case  for  significantly  reducing  the  concentration  of  airport  ownership  at  privatization\ntherefore depends on the trade-off between the up-front and visible costs of re-structuring, and\nthe  possibly  less  tangible  benefits  of  increased  competition  resulting  from  break-up.  The\ncompetition benefits in this industry are not clear-cut, primarily because major airports mainly\nserve distinct regional markets.\n\n\f16\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the authorities took the view that any potential competition gains\nfrom  breaking  up  the  British  Airport  Authority  prior  to  privatization  would  have  been  offset  by\nrestructuring costs. In Australia, in contrast, the Government has preferred to restructure and reduce\nindustry concentration radically, emphasizing the public policy benefits of inter-airport competition\nfor long haul international traffic. The benefits of fragmented ownership also include those that flow\nfrom yardstick competition, enabling regulatory agencies to assess individual operator performance\nmore  effectively;  and  from  introducing  a  limited  element  of  competition  by  emulation  between\noperators.  The  airport  expert  found  the  benefits  from  the  Australian  model  to  be  greater.  Key\nrecommendations for the airport sub-sector are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Airport privatization will be encouraged by the existence of legislation in the form of a\nBOT  law  or  similar,  signaling  the  government\u2019s  recognition  of  the  need  for  PSP  in\ninfrastructure provision. It is also important to ensure that the government is able to\ndemonstrate that any projects offered to the private sector are economically viable.\n\n\u2022 Regarding the optimum approach, full privatization based on asset transfer or acquisition\nthrough  long-term  leases  is  preferable  to  more  restricted  forms  of  PSP  (but  is  also\nmore demanding in terms of legal and regulatory frameworks).\n\n\u2022 As to airport industry restructuring, there is no evidence of significant economies of\nscale in airport operation other than those associated with increased traffic density at a\nparticular location. Hence, PSP can be based on individual airports (although facilities\nmay need to be bundled to assist financing of major new developments or extensions\nto capacity).\n\nThe  existence  of  unprofitable  airports  does  not  justify  the  maintenance  of  a  highly\nconcentrated industry structure to facilitate cross-subsidies.\n\nLimited  sharing  of  traffic  and  revenue  risk  (between  the  private  sector  partner  and\ngovernment) is justifiable in airport BOT or concession contracts.\n\n\u2022 Denomination  of  some,  or  all,  airport  charges  in  US  dollars  is  an  effective  way  of\nhedging against currency risk and may significantly reduce the risk premium required\nby private investors;\n\nThe benefits of PSP in airports are likely to be maximized by regulatory frameworks that\nincorporate good regulatory governance practice. The price-cap approach to constraining\nairport charges is likely to encourage better performance outcomes than one based on\nrate of return regulation.\n\n\u2022 Competition for the market, whether through sale or leases, or BOT/concessioning,\n\nwill be maximized by transparent bidding/sale processes.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\f17\n\nV. THE ROLE OF THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\nThe crisis has focused on the urgent need for institutional strengthening and governance\nreforms in both the financial and infrastructure sectors, areas where ADB can play a major role.\nThere  are  a  number  of  ways  identified  in  the  study  in  which  ADB  can  assist  in  the  reforms\nassociated  with  increased  PSP  in  infrastructure.  The  most  obvious  is  to  provide  technical\nassistance  to  define  policy  objectives,  develop  network  master  plans,  identify  and  evaluate\nprojects, define the role of new regulatory institutions, and train regulators to handle their new\nresponsibilities,  prepare  contracts  and  negotiate  with  the  private  sector.  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to\npromote financial sector reform and develop long term capital markets will also be important.\nThis would include efforts to improve the bankruptcy laws, and the regulation of domestic\ndebt and equity markets.\n\nIn order for ADB to have a significant role in promoting PSP, it should link this promotion\nwith on-going project lending. ADB can provide support for private sector investment directly\nthrough its private sector window and through its guarantee operations. More importantly, ADB\nshould provide sovereign loans to complement but not compete with private sector investment in\nthe  form  of  public-private  partnerships.  Public  sector  project  lending  should  also  be  used  to\nfinance basic infrastructure that cannot be packaged into financially viable investments for the\nprivate sector but provides significant economic benefits and improves sector efficiency. Program\nlending is another key modality to promote the necessary reforms where ADB provides financing\nfor the adjustment costs in stages, upon the satisfactory achievement or fulfillment of government\nactions that will promote PSP and sector restructuring. This modality allows ADB to exercise\nsome leverage on government decisions and actions to support reform. Country strategies should\naddress which areas of development are to be financed by government using sovereign loans,\ngeneral revenues and government bonds and which are to be financed by private investment and\nshould ensure a coordinated approach to all forms of ADB assistance.\n\n\f17-A\n\n\f17-B\n\nPART TWO\n\nROADS SECTOR REPORT\n\n\f17-C\n\n\f18\n\nI.             OBJECTIVES\n\nA.\n\nContext\n\n1.\n\nObjective  of  the  Report\n\nThis report develops best practices for promoting private sector investment in the roads\nsector. Originally the subject matter was expressways. Expressways are defined in this report\nas:  access-controlled  roads  capable  of  providing  a  high  level  of  service,  with  a  capturable\nrevenue stream. Subsequently, it was decided that the report should incorporate the whole\nroads  sector,  since  much  potential  exists  for  private  sector  participation  (PSP)  other  than\nexpressways.  In  practice,  the  report  focuses  on  the  main  road  network,  which  attracts\nreasonably high traffic flows, and may either be tolled or subject to \u2018shadow tolls\u2019 (by which\npayment  is  made  to  the  concessionaire  on  the  basis  of  the  traffic  \u2014  but  without  collecting\npayment from motorists directly).\n\nThe report is set out as follows:\n\nChapter I \u2013 Defines the objectives of PSP, and the objectives for the roads sector, as a\nbasis for measuring \u2018success\u2019.\n\nChapter II \u2013 Reviews experience - in Asia and elsewhere, and establishes the degree of\nsuccess that has been achieved to date.\n\nChapter III \u2013 Identifies the key issues, which provide the basis for defining best practices.\n\nChapter IV \u2013 Defines best practices, draws conclusions, and identifies the role for the\n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB).\n\n2.\n\nThe Demand for Investment\n\nThe context for this technical assistance is that the demand for infrastructure investment in\nAsia is much greater than the public sector can finance (given macro-economic lending constraints\nand the willingness of people to pay - and government to collect - taxes). Funding by the private\nsector is therefore necessary.\n\nThe  World  Bank  (World  Bank,  1995)  estimated  the  indicative  infrastructure  investment\nrequirements for Asia for 1995-2O04.5 The transport sector demand was estimated to be about\nUS$500 billion. The proportion of transport sector funding represented by the roads sector was\nnot  defined,  but  would  represent  the  majority.  Assuming  it  is  60  per  cent,  the  demand  for\ninvestment in the roads sector would be about US$350 billion, or some US$35 billion per year.\nThis sets the scale of the challenge.\n\n5\n\nThis  was  done  as  part  of  major  research  into  the  infrastructure  sector,  which  was  the  theme  of  the 1994 World Development\nReport. The estimates are based upon World Bank country and sector specific reviews and on a quantitative modeling exercise.\n\n\f19\n\n3.\n\nKey Issues Facing PSP in the Roads Sector\n\nIt is important to start from a viewpoint of realism. Four factors identify the dimensions of\n\nthis and point to the challenges that must be faced:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFor 15 years, Asia\u2019s press has been inundated with articles on build-operate-transfer\n(BOT) projects. But despite the rhetoric, the record of projects completed is \u2014 with a\nfew exceptions \u2014 small. Instead, the experience has often been frustrating for those\nconcerned. There has been few benefits for road users and few profits for participating\ncompanies.\n\nThe experience of implemented projects has been mixed - some good, and some not\nso  good.  The  objective  should  be  to  secure  private  sector  investment  in  the  public\ninterest. These last four words are crucial \u2014 for private sector investment alone may\nnot  be  desirable.  This  report  probes  how  PSP  can  deliver  investment  in  the  public\ninterest.\n\nIn Asia, this subject has to date been confined to so-called BOT projects6 \u2014 usually\nvery large new infrastructure projects. This is not the case elsewhere \u2014 notably in Latin\nAmerica, where lower cost approaches have been implemented widely. This report will\nconclude that the potential for PSP in Asia will be realized only when these other PSP\napproaches are applied. This report therefore considers all such options.\n\nThe attitudes and motivations of the key players determine what happens in practice,\nand it is important to commence here (see Table 1).\n\n6\n\nBOT is used here as the generic name for major projects implemented under private sector concessions.\n\n\f20\n\nTable 1: Motivation/Attitudes of the Key Players\n\nGovernments7\n\ntraffic/benefits).\n\neffort.\n\n\u2022 Politicians  want  the  physical  result:  an  expressway  (and  are  often  little  concerned  with its\n\n\u2022 A \u2018cargo cult\u2019 mentality: BOT projects - a cost-less solution which happen without major government\n\n\u2022 Expressways can be built without acquiring land.\n\u2022 Infrastructure makes money - the easy solution.\n\u2022 All BOT projects are a good thing.\n\u2022 BOT a substitute for transport policy (capacity expansion is the core policy objective).\n\u2022 Once a concession is let, it is up to the private sector to make it a success (no active government\n\nsupport is necessary).\n\n\u2022 Reluctance to contemplate tolling existing free roads.\n\u2022 concern to keep tolls affordable to road users.\n\u2022 Reluctance to give up control, and concern to protect government jobs.\n\nProject Sponsors/Developers\n\n\u2022 Belief that a combination of purposeful action, good connections, and some technical/financial\nwork can: (i) secure government approval for a new project and (ii) result in effective implementation.\n\u2022 Primary objective for contractor members is short-term construction profits, and an acceptable exit\n\nstrategy once the project is operational.\n\n\u2022 Interest in future business prospects in the country (growth in profits come from spreading start-up\n\ncosts over enlarged networks).\n\n\u2022 Focus on maximizing revenue capture from tolls.\n\nFinancial Institutions\nTheir concerns are:\n\u2022 the downside risk - bankers have no upside;\n\u2022 to put a floor under the risk - and get others to take the risk below this.\nTheir requirements are:\n\u2022 strong government commitment to private sector policy;\n\u2022 an adequate legal framework, as a precondition;\n\u2022 adequate procedures for project development (planning consent, environmental, land acquisition\n\netc) are essential;\n\u2022 sound business plan;\n\u2022 government to have access to world-class consultants, contractors, operators;\n\u2022 forecastable (reliable) project financial risk profile;\n\u2022 acceptable allocation of risks, and where necessary government support;\n\u2022 equity to be fully committed.\n\nCommunity Groups\n\n\u2022 Power of the anti-toll and anti-car lobby.\n\u2022 concern that the alignment protects sensitive areas.\n\u2022 concern  that  environmental  and  social  policies  are  not  circumvented  -  re:  land  acquisition!\n\ncompensation/relocation.\n\n7\n\nIn the early stages, many of these views are widely held by domestic financial institutions and project\nsponsors/developers  too.\n\n\f21\n\n4.\n\nThe Sustainability Agenda\n\nExperience demonstrates the importance of the right transport policy. Transport is central\nto delivering prosperity and the quality of life to which most countries aspire. This is because the\nimpacts  of  transport  policy  are  pervasive.  Policy  may  impact  on  economic  performance  (and\ntherefore  incomes);  on  the  shape  and  structure  of  human  settlements  through  its  impact  upon\nphysical development and economic structures; on the distribution of income (and therefore the\nbalance of winners and losers, and on poverty); and on the environment (and hence on the quality\nand enjoyment of life).\n\nTransport policy can become a catalyst for creating synergy in public policy, delivering\na wide range of benefits, or its failure can create bottlenecks and frustrate the best-prepared\nplans. Transport policy is central to the sustainable development that forward-thinking leaders\nincreasingly recognize as essential. Yet a review of the performance of the sector in ADB\u2019s\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) shows that all is not well, and that this potential is rarely\nbeing realized.\n\nIt is concluded that this shortfall in performance is substantially a failure of the traditional\nsystem  of  government-led  planning,  implementation,  and  regulation.  This  is  manifest  by\nineffective and under-investment, and by the failure to tackle effectively the scale and diversity\nof problems that face the sector. This is firstly an institutional problem, and secondly a failure of\ntransport policy; yet many believe that the solution lies in more government funding and more\nprojects.\n\nThe decades ahead pose new challenges for transport policy. Two are fundamental:\n(i) it is increasingly recognized that policy must be sustainable \u2014 planning must be for the\nlong-term, as well as for tomorrow and the day after; and (ii) markets must increasingly set\nthe transport agenda of tomorrow, to meet the diverse and changing needs of consumers and\nproducers \u2014 partly the result of global competition, and because of limitations on future public\nfunding. New challenges need to be met too - the need to develop intermodal transport chains,\ntackle  rapidly  increasing  urban  transport  problems,  address  the  predicted  large  increases  in\nmotorization, reduce the large and increasing toll of traffic-related deaths and injuries, and address\nthe profound concerns associated with increasing air pollution.\n\nHow  do  we  \u2018meet  the  needs  of  the  present  without  compromising  the  ability  of  future\ngenerations  to  meet  their  own  needs\u2019?8 The  World  Bank  has  published  its  conclusions  after  a\nsubstantive  review  of  policy  (World  Bank,  1996).  There  are  three  strands  to  the  answer:\n(i) economic sustainability, this recognizes that economic growth is a valid objective of society;\nwhich must go hand-in-hand with (ii) social sustainability, the problems of poverty and protection\nof  the  disadvantaged  are  central  to  the  sustainability  agenda;  and  (iii)  environmental\nsustainability \u2014 congestion, pollution, sprawling development and the exhaustion of resources\nall threaten a sustainable future.\n\n8\n\nThis is the definition of sustainability commonly adopted, from Our Common Future (The Bruntland Report), World Commission on\nEnvironment and Development, Oxford University Press, 1987.\n\n\f22\n\nCompetition is the key to promoting efficiency in the sector, and economic sustainability\nrequires the creation of competitive markets (competition in or for the market). This is a central\ntask of government, and it poses critical problems for a government not experienced in the skills of\nlight regulation - of how to regulate in the public interest. When \u2018the prices are right\u2019 scarce resources\nwill increasingly be allocated efficiently, cost recovery will improve, and the sector will become\nincreasingly attractive to the private sector. In short, the imperative of a sustainable transport policy\ngoes hand-in-hand with the funding imperatives for the transport sector.\n\nThe global change to \u2018A New World\u2019 provides the driving force behind the new transport\n\nstrategy. Its characteristics are summarized in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: The Change to \u2018A New World\u2019\n\nCharacteristic\nPolicy Objectives\n\n\u2018Old World\u2019\n\nPromoting economic\ngrowth\nReducing poverty\n\nPlanning Timeframe\n\nShort/medium term\n\nDriving Forces\n\nPublic sector\nmanagement/funding\n\nForms of Intervention\n\nInvestment in projects\n\n\u2018New  World\u2019\n\nPromoting economic growth\nReducing poverty\nProtecting the environment\nImproving the status of women\nSupporting human development\nShort/medium and long-term\n\nPrivate sector skills/resouces and public sector\npolicy making, regulation, facilitation restructuring\nprocurement\n\nCapacity building/institutional restructuring\nPolicy reform to create competitive markets\nInvestment in projects\n\nThis future will be very different from the past, and requires a new transport policy agenda.\nThe changes may be expected to take 10-15 years to complete, and once embarked upon are\nlikely to be irreversible.\n\nCentral to the sustainability agenda is that increasingly, users must pay for the (improved)\nservices they receive - there is no other way to fund the sector. But because of problems in collecting\ntolls, the roads sector is unlike others - charges for use are currently rare.9 There are two options\nfor funding the sector:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe introduction of direct user charges - as with tolled expressways.\n\nIncreasing gasoline and diesel prices, such that they incorporate a specific user charge,\nwhich is earmarked for sector investment.\n\nTechnology will increasingly allow user charges to be brought into line with use, although\n\nthis will take time before it can be applied to developing countries.\n\n9\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is a notable exception. Until the recent reforms, PRC did not have a good intercity road network - inter-\ncity trade and travel was mainly by rail. A new road network is being created and financed through the incremental application of tolls\nto finance construction and maintenance.\n\n\f23\n\n5.\n\nLearning  from  Experience\n\nThis phase of PSP and investment in infrastructure is relatively new - and only dates back\nto the mid 1980\u2019s; so everyone is on a learning curve. The purpose of this technical assistance is\nto facilitate \u2018jumping up\u2019 the learning curve, by drawing on experiences elsewhere, in the context of\nthe future imperatives of transport policy.\n\nMuch that we see today is relatively crude, and there is surprisingly little innovation in\nAsian PSP in this sector, while some examples are clearly problematic when measured against\nthe  public  policy  objectives  described.  This  should  not  be  a  surprise  or  a  cause  for  undue\nconcern \u2014 providing purposeful steps are taken to improve the situation, in recognition of the\nscale of the problem, and the urgency required. The Asian economic crisis is providing that\nspur to improvement, and this study is required to define a strategy, and open up the possibilities,\nfor such purposeful steps to be taken.\n\n6.\n\nThe Asian Economic Crisis\n\nHow can investor confidence be regenerated, post-crisis? The starting point is to understand\nthe  cause  and  impact  of  the  crisis.  Arguably  it  is  a  failure  to  deliver  productive  private  sector\ninvestments in this (and other) sectors that is a contributory cause of the crisis.\n\nThe capital cost of a typical BOT project is huge compared with the scale of public funding\n\nin the sector:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 BOT expressway projects typically cost US$0.25 billion - US$1 .0 billion.\n\nThe annual public investment in the whole transport sector (roads, rail, ports, airports)\nin developing countries is low - in the Philippines it is just US$1 .2 billion.\n\nThis highlights the importance of good BOT projects which massively increase sector\nfunding.\n\n\u2022 But even a few BOT projects, which do not deliver expected benefits, become a dead\n\nweight, and can affect the ability of the national economy to grow.\n\nThe current crisis has huge implications for the future, and should be seen as both a threat\n\nand an opportunity for future Asian PSP strategy in this sector.\n\na.\n\nThe  Threat\n\nIt is paradoxical that there is a huge investment shortfall that the private sector is required to\nmeet; yet the impact of the crisis is very likely to be a reduction in sector funding. Bankers expect\nlittle new risk investment for the next three years. The following responses to the crisis are taking\nplace:\n\n\u2022 Government transport infrastructure budgets are being cut, due to reduced economic\n\ngrowth, and increased priorities for social spending in the short-term.\n\n\u2022 Project  costs  are  increasing  in  domestic  currency  terms,  as  currencies  have\n\ndepreciated.\n\n\f24\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTraffic and revenues are stagnating, and forecasts are being revised downwards \u2014due\nto expected lower economic growth and incomes.\n\nThe  prospects  for  project  finances  to  be  supported  by  property  deals,  have  been\nundermined by weak property markets.\n\n\u2022 Many private investors have been badly hit by the shock. There is more caution from the\n\nprivate sector in respect to BOT projects.\n\n\u2022 Some governments are only now realizing their liabilities under concession contracts.\n\nCombined with concerns for the macroeconomy, they too are more cautious.\n\nb.\n\nThe  Opportunities\n\nIf the right steps are taken, investor confidence will be re-established. The next five-year\n\nperiod is the time when concerted action is required:\n\nIt provides the opportunity for government to create the necessary PSP environment.\nThis is already happening.\n\nInvestors are now forcing a much more rigorous appraisal of projects than hitherto.\n\nIt is at times of crisis that peoples\u2019 minds open up to new ways of doing things.\n\nThe crisis reinforce the need for a change of focus to include lower-cost/higher-impact\nPSP modalities, as well as massive BOT infrastructure projects.\n\nThe  crisis,  therefore,  provides  a  window  of  opportunity  for  the  governments  of  Asia\u2019s\n\ndeveloping countries, and for ADB to assist them in the transition towards \u2018The New World\u2019.\n\nB.\n\nPSP and Funding\n\n1.\n\nPSP  Objectives\n\nExperience shows that there are two broad reasons for embarking on PSP:\n\n\u2022 Because the government\u2019s imperative to do something is not matched by the reality of\nthe public finances - and private funding is the only option (sometimes too it is seen as\nthe easy option, and therefore the obvious course to follow - particularly as most people\nseem to think that infrastructure makes money).\n\n\u2022 Because PSP is seen as the better way, leading to sector efficiency, and funding its\n\nnatural consequence - but not necessarily its principal objective.\n\nToday, most countries fall into the first category. In Europe, the United Kingdom (UK) has\nbroken out of this thinking, and in Asia, Hong Kong, China; has done likewise. Worldwide, the\ndevelopment banks are leading the argument and assisting their DMCs in the transition to the\nsecond category - recognizing that PSP is the better way. In Asia\u2019s developing countries there\nare many individuals who are leading this change in mindset, but there is a long way to go before\nthe true rationale for PSP is understood and believed.\n\n\f25\n\nPart of the reason is that PSP is seen by many in the public sector as a threat, both\n\ninstitutionally and personally. These attitudes are understandable, and need to be addressed in\nthe context of strong political leadership \u2014 which is increasingly taking place.\n\nMany are also asking whether the balance between economic objectives and social/\nenvironmental impacts has been addressed? What are the social equity and environmental\nimplications of the PSP policy - and more to the point, should existing policies be changed to\ntarget these concerns?\n\nWith this introduction, Table 3 defines a framework which allows the success or\notherwise of PSP in the public interest to be assessed, and Table 4 identifies key issues arising\nfrom PSP policies.\n\n\f26\n\nTable 3: Objectives of PSP and Funding\n\nComment\n\nObjective\n\n1.\n\n POLITICAL\nImplement something.\n\nCreate an entrepreneurial\nclass/group,\n\nAllow public funds to be\nallocated to other priority\nsectors, and/or reduce taxes\nTechnology transfer\n\n2.

Bank\n\npolicies are targeted to counter this.\n\nAll of the Banks like to appoint (at the expense of the concessionaire) an independent engineer.\nThese requirements are demanding. This is because the decision to implement such projects is\noften a big decision \u2014 projects typically have major impacts and major opportunity costs; and it\nshould not be surprising that demanding requirements need to be met.\n\nThe policies of the banks in these respects are summarized in Table 6.\n\n10\n\nADB  is  involved  in  various  stages  of  appraisal  and  loan  processing  for  other  projects,  including:  Ciawi-Sukabumi\n(Indonesia  -  suspended);  Guangzhou-Zuhai  (dormant);  Delhi  Bridge  (India  -  active:  ADB  would  invest  US$5  million\nequity and lend US$20 million of a US$100 million project); Pasig Expressway (Philippines - active), Chaing RaiLaos-\nKunming  (active).\n\n\fTable 6:       Developemnt Bank Requirements for Involvement in PSP Expressways\n\nDevelopment Bank\nRequirements\n\nCompatible  with\ncoutry/sector\nstrategy\n\nADB\n\nIFC\n\nEBRD\n\nIADB\n\nMust see that governments are\ncommitteed & have political will to\nfulfill  contractual  obligation\n\nRequires  government\ncommitment\n\nMust have transition impacts & fall\nwithin  a  coherent,  sustainable  national\ntransport  policy\n\nGovernment must approve &\ncountry regulatory system must not\ncompromise  project  feasibility\n\nTechnically  Feasible\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes.

These problems are often not marginal, but reflect a fundamental failure over a prolonged\nperiod, and frequently after repeated assistance from development banks.\n\nThe problems in the Philippines are just one example (Allport, 1998, op cit):\n\n\u201cThe core problem is institutional, in that the Department of Public Works and\nHighways (DPWH) is not sufficiently proactive in maintaining and developing the\nnational  road  network.  The  symptoms  of  this  problem  are  many:  there  is  no\nstrategy for the sector, with priorities for what to do, how, where and when; there\nis  a  patchy  picture  of  maintenance,  some  good  but  much  that  is  not  good;\nplanning is substantially ineffective; design and construction are often poor, with\nlengthy construction times, which reduce estimates of economic viability, and\nthe performance of some contractors is questionable; and there are still large\nareas with network deficiencies.\n\nThe causes are understood. First and foremost, politics intrude very extensively\nin  the  sector.  This  has  almost  completely  subverted  the  planning  and\nimplementation  process.  The  road  investment  and  maintenance  budgets  are\napproved annually by Congress, and are under constant uncertainty. In addition,\nfunding  is  spread  far  too  thinly,  leading  to  patchy  and  insufficient  project\nimplementation. As a result, DPWH has found it increasingly difficult to develop\nand implement a clear, coherent strategy, and to deliver what it is mandated to\ndeliver. Moreover, funds for national roads are allocated by DPWH to regions\naccording to a \u2018block allocation\u2019 formula - a system that does not meet actual\nengineering needs or stated physical policy objectives.\u201d\n\nThis is a common story throughout the developing world. It is paradoxical that side-by-side\nwith this profound failure - which impacts upon virtually the whole national road network, massive\nnew BOT expressway(s) monopolize the attention - projects which typically make only a small\naddition to the network.\n\nIt  is  necessary  to  establish  an  overview  of  the  sector  needs  and  priorities,  before\nconcluding that major investment in new expressways is justified. To continue the previous\nexample  for  the  Philippines,  the  priorities  for  the  current  plan  period  (1999-2004)  were\nestablished (Allport, 1998 op cit):\n\n\f31\n\nTable 7:\n\nStrategic Priorities for the Roads Sector: An Example - Philippines\n\nCategory\n\n                  Description\n\n                             Required Scale of\n\n   Expenditure\n\nMaintenance\n\nRoutine  and  periodic\n\nSubstantial\n\nRehabilitation\n\nReconstruction of the road structure\n\nSubstantial\n\nImprovement\n\nUpgrading  pavement  design/bridges  for\nheavier traffic\n\nSubstantial  (most  of  the\nnetwork)\n\nRoad  widening/realignment  and  junction\nimprovements  to  increase  capacity\n\nBypasses to avoid traffic bottlenecks\n\nSafety  improvements\n\nDevelopment\n(Penetrator)  Roads\n\nNew  roads  to  stimulate  development\n(agriculture,  mining,  tourism)\n\nSmall/very  small\n\nMissing  Links\n\nNew roads.

If a road is\nbuilt, then development is widely observed to follow it; by comparison if it is not built, or not improved,\nthen development takes place much more slowly. Over a period of one or two generations these\nchanges have a profound impact upon the structure of a city or region.\n\nThe starting point is to ask \u2018What (city or sub-regional or regional) development strategy\nis road investment required to assist in bringing about?\u2019 Given such a development strategy a\ntransport strategy needs to be formulated. This will determine the priorities for road investment,\nin the context of economic and social objectives and environmental, funding and institutional\nconstraints.\n\nNot all roads are a good thing. They may profoundly distort the development of a city,\ncause unjustifiable dislocation or destroy habitats, or create major operational problems. Many\ntransport corridors comprise other modes too, and the transport strategy needs to determine\nthe right balance of investment and policies. Ill-founded road investment can undermine such\na strategy.\n\nIn  summary,  road  investment  will  only  be  effective  if  carried  out  in  the  context  of  an\nacceptable development and transport strategy. We return to this issue later in the report, and\nreview the way that Asia\u2019s governments have sought to use expressway investment to further\ntheir policy objectives.\n\nSuffice to say now that typically expressway studies are undertaken (expressway meaning\n\nhere limited-access grade-separated high-capacity roads) in a vacuum, without:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nA meaningful development strategy (defining the objectives of transport strategy).\n\nA transport strategy (defining the roles of roads, rail, buses etc. and identifying which\ncorridors should incorporate expressways).\n\nA realistic assessment of available public funding.\n\nInstead, an expressway network is typically developed and recommended, almost always\na hugely ambitious network, which assumes that the private sector will somehow fund it. The\nresult is that government is led to believe that this can - and should happen, whereas neither is\nthe case.\n\n3.\n\nTowards Commercialization\n\nBefore becoming involved in the detail, it is helpful to look forward - say 25 years, and to\nhave some perspective on the direction of change in the roads sector. This is already becoming\napparent, and is best described as \u2018commercialization\u2019.\n\nThe  roads  sector  is  different  from  other  infrastructure  sectors,  because  it  is  not\ncommercial. Users of telecommunications or electricity or ports or railways or airports pay for\ntheir use \u2013 and the more they use, the greater the payment. The same is true in many countries\n(where  water  is  metered)  for  water.  But  it  is  not  so  for  road  transport.  Drivers  pay  annual\nlicenses to use the roads and gasoline/diesel has a large tax element - but these payments are\n\n\f33\n\nneither recognized as payments for access/use (governments take the proceeds into the general\nfund),  nor  do  they  vary  with  cost  (the  basis  of  economic  pricing).  Thus,  while  a  telecoms\ncompany offers price discounts to encourage off-peak traffic and a price supplement at peak\ntimes when users willingness-to-pay is high, there is no price mechanism in the roads sector,\nsolely congestion - the great leveler, affecting everyone, those with valuable and those with\ntrivial journeys, equally.\n\nProgress  to  full  commercialization  is  speculative,  but  is  increasingly  discussed  as  a\npossible  development  in  the  sector  (most  recently  in  Roth  1996).  Roth  describes  the  basic\ncomponents of a commercial road system, which would substantially remove government from\nthe  business  of  planning,  financing,  implementing,  managing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the\nroad system as:\n\nThere would be owners.\nThey would be financially self-supporting.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Revenues would go to those who earn them, not to governments.\n\u2022\n\nThey would operate to common standards to facilitate inter-connection.\n\nOne possible approach is described:\n\nThe national road system would be geographically divided into sectors.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Ownership would be vested in road corporations.\n\u2022 Road corporations would manage and operate the sectors.\n\u2022 New private corporations could be formed to provide new roads.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe road corporations would be regulated by government to safeguard the assets.\nIncome  could  be  from  user  charges  supplemented  by  tolling  which  would  be\ndedicated to a roads fund.\n\n\u2022 Revenues would be distributed between road corporations on a traffic-related basis.\n\nImplementation steps are suggested:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nBring about institutional reforms \u2014 the main obstacle to reform.\nIntroduce \u2018shadow tolls\u2019 - which enable new road providers to enter the market and\nshoulder some of the major risks.\nEstablish dedicated road funds.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Develop electronic methods of charging for road use (already advanced).\n\u2022 Government to be responsible for creating a competitive market for roads, ensuring\n\nconsistent technical and safety/environmental standards.\n\n4.\n\nPSP  Modalities\n\nThe  typical  PSP  modality  for  Asian  expressways  has  been  that  of  BOT  \u2014  new\nconstruction undertaken and financed in the private sector with operation and toll collection to\nsecure financing over a 20 to 30 year period, after which the asset returns to government. This\nhas  been  used  in  all  of  the  case  study  countries  and  dominates  thinking  within  the  Asian\ntransport  sector.\n\nThere are other options for involving the private sector however, which allow differing\ntransfers of responsibility and risk and can be appropriate when the government is concerned to\nensure contract stability and economic viability of the project. These other forms of contract can\nalso be useful in developing private sector capacity to undertake activities which had previously\n\n\f34\n\nbeen in the public domain and where the public sector contract management skills are still under\ndevelopment.\n\nNot all of these forms of contract require tolls to be levied, since less financial responsibility\nis being transferred away from the government. Where tolls are levied, depending on the revenue\nderived and the obligations of the private sector, payments may be made to the government.\n\nThese options can also be used where there is an existing road or network of roads, and\nthe government is seeking to improve maintenance or to rehabilitate the road (and yet not bear the\ncost or associated risks).\n\nThe full spectrum of PSP modalities in order of risk transfer to the private sector are as\n\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Maintenance  Management  Contracts  \u2014  the  private  sector  maintains  an  existing\nroad  under  performance  specifications,  for  which  it  receives  payments  from  the\ngovernment.\n\n\u2022\n\nTurnkey  Contracts  \u2014  the  private  sector  designs  and  constructs  a  new  road,  to\ngovernment specifications, and receives a fixed payment on completion.\n\n\u2022 Operation (tolling) and Maintenance Contracts \u2014 the private sector maintains the\nroad to agreed standards, and collects tolls from users which finance the maintenance.\n\n\u2022 Rehabilitation,  Maintenance  and  Operation  \u2014  the  private  sector  undertakes\nsignificant rehabilitation works to bring the existing road to agreed standards, maintains\nit to those standards, and collects tolls to finance both rehabilitation and maintenance.\n\n\u2022 BOT \u2014 the private sector undertakes and finances design, construction, tolling, and\nmaintenance, usually of large infrastructure projects. The private sector can also bear\nmuch of the risk \u2014 depending on the negotiated concession agreement.\n\n\u2022 Corridor Management Contracts \u2014 the private sector undertakes new construction\nand  the  maintenance  (or  rehabilitation)  and  operation  of  existing  facilities.  It  allows\ngovernment and the private sector to consider the roads on a corridor or network basis.\n\nThese options are described further later in the report.\n\n\f35\n\nII.  EXPERIENCE\n\nThis  section  reviews  experience  in  Asia  and  other  parts  of  the  world,  before  drawing\n\nconclusions about the degrees of success that have been achieved.\n\nIn Asia the focus is on: Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; Philippines; and Thailand - case study\ncountries which offer experience and insights to guide future policy. Appendix 1 describes these in\nsome detail.\n\nAppendix 2 describes other relevant experience, which highlights examples of interest or\n\ninnovation.\n\nA. Asia\n\n1.\n\nBOT Expressway Projects\n\nTable 9 summarizes the BOT activity in Asia - this is a summary of more detailed project\n\ninformation provided in Appendixes 1, 2, and 3.\n\nAfter a decade of effort, and huge rhetoric, there are just 20 operational projects, with a\n\nfurther 32 under construction (see Table 9).\n\nWhen  set  against  the  problems,  this  is  a  surprisingly  short  list.  One  country,  Malaysia,\ndominates and represents one-half of total activity, while seven countries have negligible activity in\nterms of construction and operational projects.\n\nThere  are  a  large  number  of  projects  being  planned  or  at  pre-planning.  This  covers\neverything from serious pre-bid activity to little more than pre-feasibility assessment. Before the\nrecent economic crisis, the realism of many projects was questionable. Now many such projects\nare dormant.\n\nThe  types  of  project  vary  by  country.  In  Thailand  and  the  Philippines  the  projects  are\nconcentrated in the capital city, and the radial roads leading from it; while in Malaysia the projects\nhave been used to help open up the country, with a mix of urban and inter-urban projects. In Hong\nKong, China; the project finance capital of Asia, is notable in that all projects have been (or in the\ncase of Route 3, incorporated major) tunnels.\n\nThe obvious questions that follow in the light of huge problems and the limited amount of\n\nactivity to date are:\n\n\u2022 How can the BOT process be improved, to deliver more projects?\n\n\u2022\n\nAre there other options to BOT, which may be more effective?\n\n\fTable 9:        Expressway BOT Concessions in Asia\n\n      Country\n\nNo. of Projects by Project Status\n\nNo Projects by Type\n\nOpen\n\nConstruction\n\nPlannng\n\nPre-Planning\n\nAbandoned\n\nTotal\n\nUrban\n\nInter-Urban\n\nBridge/Tunnel\n\nBangladesh\n\nMyanmar\n\nHong  Kong,\nChina\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nLao  PDR\n\nMalaysia\n\nPakistan\n\nSri  Lanka\n\nTaipei,  China\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nTOTAL\n\nPRC13\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4\n\n-\n\n2\n\n-\n\n9\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4\n\n-\n\n20\n\n21\n\nPhilippines\n\n-11\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n-\n\n6\n\n-\n\n-\n\n5\n\n-\n\n-\n\n5\n\n-\n\n-\n\n15\n\n32\n\n11\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n7\n\n1\n\n8\n\n3\n\n9\n\n1\n\n-\n\n2\n\n-\n\n43\n\n11\n\n20\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4\n\n-\n\n8\n\n-\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n3\n\n112\n\n35\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2\n\n-\n\n2\n\n-\n\n15\n\n35\n\n40\n\n15\n\n1\n\n-\n\n5\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n-\n\n1\n\n14\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2\n\n11\n\n-\n\n18\n\n-\n\n9\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n11\n\n52\n\n23\n\n19\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n9\n\n1\n\n4\n\n6\n\n1\n\n-\n\n3\n\n1\n\n132\n\n68\n\n12\n\n35mostly  inter-urban,  including  several  bridges\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4\n\n4\n\n1\n\n-\n\n3\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nNotes: Based upon the consultants\u2019 database of BOT projects-Appendix 3 reproduces summary informatio\nThe information is comprehensive - apart from PRC, where the picture is complicated by many deals and arranged projects.

The only examples we are aware\nof are:\n\nIn Hong Kong, China, management contracts have been let for government tunnels\n(Aberdeen, Lion Rock, etc).\n\nAlso in Hong Kong, China, the Tsing Ma Control Area management contract has been\nlet, to manage a single major corridor (leading to the new airport), and featuring an\ninnovative traffic control system.\n\nIn Pakistan, it is intended to sell the operating concession for the Lahore-Islamabad\nexpressway, the project having been constructed under government funding (via a\nKorean contractor).\n\n\u2022 Management contracts were let 20 years ago for the Manila North and South\n\nexpressways. The contractor was required to levy tolls and maintain the road, until\nthe capital cost was amortized (after which it was to revert to government, and tolls\nwere to be removed).\n\n3.\n\nCase  Studies\n\nAppendix 1 reports on the case studies for Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; Philippines; and\nThailand; which were effective in illuminating the key issues. These built on a working knowledge\nof the countries and sector, supplemented by a study tour, which benefited from the assistance\nof many individuals and organizations.\n\nTable 10 summarizes the project characteristics:\n\nThe case studies include 17 of Asia\u2019s 20 operational BOT projects, and 20 of the\nprojects under construction (these figures exclude PRC for which information is\nincomplete, but where activity is extensive).\n\nAll countries have plans for major future programs. Malaysia, which has 18 projects\nopen or under construction, plans to double this network. This points to the scale of\nactivity in the sector - and it reinforces the embryonic stage of development almost\neverywhere else.\n\n\u2022 More than half the projects are urban. This is very different from Western Europe,\n\nwhere such projects are uncommon.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\f38\n\n18\n3\n19\n40\n\nTable 10: Project Characteristics in Case Study Countries\n\nParameter\n\nPhilippines\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nHong Kong,\n\nTotal\n\n14\n\nProjects by Status\nOperational\nConstruction\nPlanning\nPre-Planning\nTotal\n\nProjects by Type\nUrban  (elevated/at-grade)\nBridges/  tunnels  (urban)\nInterurban  (at-grade)\nTotal\n\nProjects by Route-kms\nOperational\nConstruction\nPlanning\nPre-Planning\nTotal\n\n0\n5\n9\n1\n15\n\n9\n0\n6\n14\n\n0\n169\n545\n270\n984\n\n9\n15\n8\n8\n\n4\n4\n5\n1\n16\n2                                -\n-\n1\n5\n40                          12\n\n15\n\n9\n0\n3\n12\n\n0\n4\n1\n5\n\n17\n26\n19\n10\n72\n\n36\n7\n29\n72\n\n183\n1,189\n189\n734\n694\n66\n202                     4,150\n4,588\n\n2,819\n\n17\n\n18\n\n10                   1,382\n1,102\n10\n1,305\n-\n4,622\n-\n8,411\n20\n\nNotes: Figures are approximate.

Asia is Different\n\nIt is clear that in two respects Asia is currently different to other regions of the world: there\nis  an  exclusive  concentration  on  BOT  to  the  exclusion  of  other  forms  of  PSP;  and  there  is  a\nconcentration on urban projects. Asian countries have generally planned huge expressway systems\non the basis of optimistic growth assumptions that some countries have indeed achieved, on the\nassumption  that  they  represent  a  sound  basis  of  transport  policy.  This  has  been  done  almost\nuniformly without attention to public sector affordability, because the projects were expected to be\nprofitable for the private sector.\n\nBy contrast, in Latin America, PSP policies have been devised against a background of\nsevere economic problems - what has been implemented has been that which could clearly be\nafforded, and often they were assisted by the World Bank or IADB. Urban hierarchies are different\ntoo - with many large cities, whereas many Asian countries are primate, with activity dominated by\nthe capital city and the roads radiating from it, and lower levels of traffic on the inter-urban road\nnetwork.\n\nWestern  Europe  has  virtually  no  urban  expressways,  partly  because  of  public  concern\nabout their acceptability, and partly because of a recognition of their lack of merit in contributing to\nsustainable transport policy; while large inter-urban expressways have been developed by both the\nprivate and public sectors, but mostly requiring substantial public sector support.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, pressure for expressways comes from Western Europe which is both\ntheir role model, and political objective. For the European Union (EU) has invested hugely in its\nperipheral lower-income member states, to reduce income disparities; and there is an expectation\nthat as the EU expands, the countries of Eastern Europe will benefit from similar investment in\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe  United  States  has  been  slower  to  get  onto  the  BOT  bandwagon  because  of  the\ninterstate highway system, which has created a highly developed inter-urban highway network\nsince the 1950s, and because of the social backlash against urban expressways in the 1 960s\nand 70s. Hence, little new construction was considered until the 1 980s when urban radial roads\nwere  beginning  to  be  considered  to  relieve  traffic  congestion.  However,  there  remains  little\ninterest  because:  the  projects  are  still  very  political;  there  were  early  failures  (e.g.,  Dulles\nTollway); and perhaps because of the difficulty of US employment law which does not allow\ngovernment  funds  to  be  spent  on  projects  which  will  put  existing  government  units  out  of\nbusiness.\n\n\f42\n\n    Objective\n1. Political\nImplement\nsomething\n\nTable 12: Degrees of Success in Meeting PSP Objectives\n\n             Examples of Degrees of Success\n\nAchieved on a massive scale in Mexico (unsuccessful), and Malaysia (mixed experience).\nIndividual projects implemented with difficulty, e.g., Don Muang Tollway (Bangkok), Skyway (Manila).\nGeneral conclusion is that the private sector is limited in what it can achieve, without strong government\n(this refers to: its ability to plan, purchase and clear land, award necessary permits, and get political\nacceptance of the scheme).\n\nCreate an\nEntrepreneurial\nClass/Group25\n\nPreserves social cohesion: a major objective of PSP in Malaysia, to develop a bumiputra\nentrepreneurial class. This has been achieved.\nFavors to one group/relatives may be an objective of politicians \u2014 achieved in Indonesia for example.\n\nA major objective of PSP in Hong Kong, China achieved.\n\nAllow public\nfunds to be\ndiverted to other\npriority sectors,\nand/or reduce\ntaxes\n\n2. Economic Efficiency26\n\nBetter travel\nconditions for\nroad users\n\nBetter\ndecisions, by\nmaking risks\nexplicit\n\nImproved\nimplementation\nperformance\n(faster,  lower-\ncost and more\npredictable)\n\nInnovation\n\nIncreased public\nsector\nproductivity\n\n3. Social\n\nThis is substantially achieved on inter-urban routes.\nExpressways in cities alone do not do this - Bangkok, Seoul and Tokyo all have large but extremely\ncongested expressway networks.\nRelatively few trucks use expressways, contrary to expectation (and presumably policy): Hungary M1/\nM5 is an example.\n\nUndoubtedly so, but difficult to prove.\nSee the Hungary M1 and M5 case studies for example \u2014 Appendix 2.\n\nThe sector has traditionally been characterized by long delays before construction, and prolonged\nconstruction periods.\nWhere the BOT system works well, implementation is faster and lower-cost. Hong Kong, China and\nAustralia are examples.\nOtherwise PSP almost certainly improves construction times (e.g., Malaysia). Its impact on cost\nhowever depends upon procurement, particularly the existence of effective competition.\n\nThere are many examples of innovation, some very important:\nNon-BOT forms of PSP: Argentina, New South Wales, and Hong Kong, China.\nUK DBFO - shadow tolls, new forms of risk allocation, new \u2018players\u2019 and innovative project types.\nTariff innovation, providing stability, guarantee of increases and allocating risk - Hong Kong\u2019s Toll\nStability Fund.\nTargeting the lower-income: Malaysia where bus tolls are less than a car and where provision is\nmade for motor-cycles.\nFinancing: Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, China - where projects are listed on the stock exchange.\nMarketing BOT projects to users - Tate\u2019s Cairn Tunnel, Hong Kong, China.\nConstruction techniques - Manila Skyway.\nMultimodal linkages - Hopewell in Philippines: expressway to port/power station.\n\nNew South Wales management contracts, which have developed into a partnering approach.\n\nADB focusing on maximizing the social benefits by increasing the catchment area of expressways in\nPRC.\nMalaysia provides concessionary tolls for buses, and provides facilities for mc\u2019s. But these are isolated\nexamples of providing for lower-income groups.\nThe evidence is that BOT projects do not circumvent government guidelines for land acquisition/ relocation.\n\n4. Environment\n\nBOT projects certainly distort development strategy, reinforcing existing undesirable trends. BOT projects\nare often elevated, causing visual and severance problems.\n\n25\n\n26\n\n  May  be  a  valid  objective  of  policy,  or  be  a  corrupt  transfer  of  national  resources  to  private  individuals/groups.\nOnly exceptionally, are before and after studies available.\n\n\f                 Issue\n\n1. Private Sector\u2019s ability to\nidentify  and  implement\nprojects\n\n2. Ability to introduce!\n\nincrease  tolls\n\nTable 13:          Impact on Key Expressway PSP Issues\n\n43\n\nImpact\n\n27\n\nAchieved notably in Malaysia, with strong government commitment, and\nproactive private sector.\nThis is however the exception - many times the approach has failed to deliver\nprojects efficiently: UK Birmingham Northern Relief Road, Bangkok Don Muang\nTollway, and Hopewell are examples.\nIt has also failed to develop \u2018good\u2019 projects \u2014 witness Bangkok\u2019s competing\nexpressways.\n\nPRC is an exception - tolls readily used, acceptable, often no realistic free\nalternative. But in other countries:\nTolls are always difficult to introduce e.g., Thailand.\nA free alternative is normally required by government.\nConcessionaire\u2019s and government objectives are in conflict.\nThe location of toilgates very sensitive: Mozambique-South Africa N4, KL\nCheras, Mexico are examples.\nToll increases are almost uniformly subject to political interference: in Thailand,\nMexico, to some extent Malaysia, and until the Toll Stability Fund, even Hong\nKong, China.\nUndoubtedly PSP reduces \u2018leakage\u2019, which is common with government projects.\n\n3. Macroeceonomic  effects:\n\nYes in Mexico: crowding out domestic markets and requiring foreign funding,\nwith disastrous results.\n\nCrowding out other\ninvestment\n\nForeign exchange\nexposure\n\nMisallocation of Resources\n\nMaybe an issue in Malaysia, where the scale of investment relative to market\nsize has been large.\n\nMexico demonstrated the crippling impact of devaluation on unprotected project\nfinances.\nA major current concern in the wake of recent devaluations, emphasising the\nimportance of domestic financing.\nCertainly a concern in Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia.\n\nWhere much has happened quickly, there is particular concern that economic internal\nrates of return (EIRRs) are poor or mixed. Certainly so in Mexico, mixed performance in\nMalaysia, concern in Thailand.\nMany projects have questionable EIRR\u2019s, with traffic much less than estimated.\nBecause investment costs are very large relative to the roads sector budget (yet\nlots of rehabilitation and maintenance is needed on existing roads), the\nopportunity cost of misallocation is large - reducing future economic growth.\n\n4. Development  of  Domestic\n\nCapital  Markets\n\nThe hypothesis is that PSP may develop new financial mechanisms and\nproducts, with widespread benefits. No evidence was obtained one way or the\nother, except perhaps in the stock market floatations in Malaysia and Hong\nKong, China.\n\n27\n\n Reference should be made to sections 4,5 and Appendix 2 for detail.\n\n\f44\n\nTable 13:           Impact on Key Expressway PSP Issues (continued)\n\n                Issue\n\n5. Road Network\nDevelopment\n\nPace of network\ndevelopment?\nDoes the private sector\nassist - or constrain\nnetwork development?\n\n6. Impact on Development\nand Transport Strategy\n\nConcessions may constrain\nand/or distort strategy, by\nconcentration on the major\ncorridors\n\n7. Social/Environmental\n\nissues\n\nConcessions may affect the\napplication of social and\nenvironmental policy\n\n8. Development of road\ntransport  companies\n\n9. Procurement\n\n10.  Implementation\n\n11. Political\n\n12. Role of international\n   financial institutions\n\nImpact\n\nWhere much is done quickly, there is little opportunity to learn from mistakes \u2014\nMexico and Malaysia are examples.\nNo evidence that private groups are developing strategic networks \u2014 except\nMalaysia where Renong are prominent in the transport sector.\nThe existence of government toll roads with no clear policy for toll increases can\nundermine BOT projects: Hong Kong, China\u2019s tunnels are an example.\nThere should be concern that expressway projects do not cumulatively become\nan integrated network, unless tolling equipment is standardized. In Hong Kong,\nChina there are 2 technologies, in Sydney 3, in Malaysia 2.\nInstitutional conflict creates great problems in Thailand where the projects of\nseveral agencies \u2018compete\u2019. One result is the abandonment of Hopewell.\n\nWhen concessions are let (often without construction taking place), and in the\nabsence of clear policy, the result can become a straightjacket, which constrains\nfuture government action. This describes Bangkok \u2014 almost every corridor has\none or more BOT prolects.\nHigh land prices and the attempt to find profits result in BOT projects\nconcentrating along existing transport corridors, rather than new alignments\nopening up areas for development. Urban efficiency requires megablocks to be\nbroken up, but PSP makes this less likely.\nThe BOT approach is sometimes market-led, focused on the capital and roads\nradiating from it. Most such projects still require substantial government\ninvestment. The result may be to starve high priority/lower-cost projects, and\ndisadvantaged regions of public investment. This is in prospect in the Philippines.\n\nThere is little evidence that projects are designed to secure social equity or\nenvironmental objectives.\nThere is however no evidence that PSP circumvents government requirements\nregarding land acquisition, relocation and compensation. In Bangkok revaluing\nland at market prices increased the cost of all BOT projects markedly.\nNeither is there compelling evidence that direct impact of BOT projects (visual,\nseverance etc) are worse or better than other projects.\n\nCompanies have developed in the UK and elsewhere.\nBut in Asia, concession companies are usually strongly construction-led.\nIn Hong Kong, China the later winning concessionaires (Western Harbour Tunnel\nand Route 3) have not included any contractor equity \u2014 a preferred arrangement.\n\nBOT processes vary hugely. Hong Kong, China is without doubt the benchmark in\nAsia. Many countries secure little or no competition or risk transfer, with obvious\nresults.\nThe absence of transparent procurement processes can readily result in\nsubstantial corruption, which frustrates the core PSP objectives.\n\nTraffic congestion during construction is a concern, but is surprisingly well managed,\nand not a serious problem.\nFailed implementation is rare. When it occurs it is problematic. This faces the Thai authori-\nties re Hopewell.\n\nThere is sometimes a fear of \u2018re-colonization\u2019 by foreigners. This exists in Eastern\nEurope, but not in Asia.\nThere is sometimes concern to protect government jobs. This stopped the\nHungary M3, and has been a problem in Poland too.\n\nIFI\u2019s play almost no direct role in project financing.\nThis is for a variety of reasons: the size and economic viability of the projects,\nconcerns about their preparation, concerns about competitive procurement etc.\nIn Asia the sole expressway involvement has been Bangkok Second Stage\nExpressway (ADB).\n\n\f    45\n\nWe started this report by noting that there were two generic arguments for PSP - a need for\nprivate funding so that political aspirations could be implemented, and a belief in PSP as the better\nway to improve sector efficiency. It is notable that those countries that support the second argument:\nfor example, UK; Hong Kong, China; and Australasia \u2014 have not developed huge expressway\nBOT networks, but rather targeted individual BOT investments, and developed alternative PSP\nmodalities, widely.\n\n2. Conclusions\n\nThe overwhelming conclusion is that in Asia it is early days for PSP:\n\n\u2022 Despite the rhetoric, there are not many projects: just 20 operational to date (with\n\nmany more in PRC).\n\n\u2022 Only  a  handful  of  projects  are  profitable  -  they  are  the  exception.  Clearly,  the\nwidespread belief that \u2018BOT expressways make money\u2019 is, outside PRC, incorrect.\nThis conclusion is reinforced by all the evidence in Asia, Latin America, Western\nEurope, and in Eastern Europe.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  make  unprofitable  projects  profitable  without  radical  changes  in\ngovernment  policy  towards  the  road  sector.  Linking  property  development  to\nexpressways is rarely an answer (the revenues are uncertain, and few banks will lend\non the basis of them). Providing substantial assets certainly helps \u2014 for example, an\nexisting un-tolled expressway or tunnel, when tolled and extended may indeed be\nprofitable as a private concession.\n\nThere is a very mixed performance against the stated PSP objectives - some good but\nmuch that is not good:\n\nImplementation, yes - some projects, but not always in the public interest.\n\nBetter  implementation:  faster  usually,  lower-cost  only  sometimes  (depending  on\nthe extent of competition).\n\nSubstantial private funds mobilized, but often underwritten by government - and\nmore limited amounts of risk capital.\n\nBetter travel for inter-urban road users, but in cities expressways certainly (alone)\ndo not solve traffic congestion.\n\n- Certainly  advances  in  understanding  risks  -  a  major  advance;  but  often  risks\n\nsubsumed by government, explicitly or implicitly.\n\nInnovation - yes, many good examples but usually isolated (see below).\n\n\u2022\n\nThere are varying impacts on the key issues identified:\n\nLittle evidence that the private sector can alone make projects happen.\n\nAlmost always problems introducing tolls, with the location of tollgates sensitive.\nPervasive interference in allowing contracted toll increases to occur.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\f46\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nEvidence that implementing too much too quickly is risky, resulting in a substantial\nmisallocation of resources (with no chance to learn from experience) and may\nalso have adverse macroeconomic effects.\n\nA   public   policy   question   concerning   the   development   of   an   integrated\nexpressway network from individual (competing) concessionaires: how is this\nto be done? No one yet has the answer.\n\n- Concern that the policy is distorting public investment priorities substantially\nby  default,  because  of  the  wide  ption  that  projects  are  profitable,  and  the\ncontingent liabilities many governments take on, and are then called.\n\n- Concern that corruption is undermining the core PSP objectives.\n\n- Concern too that the policy is not encouraging urban efficiency, rather reinforcing\nexisting transport taxes, and failing to bring inaccessible land into development.\n\n-\n\nLittle evidence that social equity objectives are incorporated in projects, when\nthey could be.\n\n- Reassurance that the policy is not subverting governments\u2019 environmental and social\n\n- Reassurance  that  traffic  disruption  during  implementation  is  by-and-large  well-\n\npolicies.\n\nmanaged.\n\n\u2022\n\nMany aspects of PSP are relatively primitive:\n\nIn  Asia,  PSP  is  often  assumed  to  mean  BOT  projects,  which  is  surprising  -\nBOT projects are the exception, and will only rarely be widely implemented.\nThere  is,  by  contrast,  no  use  of  lower-cost  PSP  options,  which  have  the\npotential to be applied widely.\n\nEmphasis is almost exclusively on implementing a construction project, rather\nthan on improving the level of service in the transport corridor - which requires\nother  issues  to  be  addressed  such  as:  integration  with  the  existing  roads,\nconserving  the  capacity  of  existing  roads,  reducing  accidents,  minimizing\ndisruption from incidents, maintenance, etc.\n\nBOT projects comprise huge pieces of infrastructure, whose construction it would\nseem natural to stage. Yet Hungary M5 and some of the expressways in Buenos\nAires are the only examples we are aware of.\n\nTolls only rarely derive from public policy objectives, rather they are the results\nof the bidding process. Yet it is clear they are important in determining the impact\nof expressways and therefore their rationale. If tolls for trucks are high (the normal\ncase), few trucks use the expressway. If tolls for buses are low (as in one case\n-Malaysia), then the benefits for low-income travelers are huge.\n\n\f    47\n\n-\n\nTariffs are often optimized for revenue-maximization on opening, then allowed to\nbecome hugely sub-optimal. And they are often determined by the precedent of the\nfirst project (as in Malaysia), unrelated to the specifics of each particular project\n(which a user charge should do).\n\n\u2022\n\nThere are many examples of innovation. Some hold great promise. Yet they ar.e almost\nalways isolated, confined to one project or one country.\n\n\u2022 Governments are only now coming to terms with the scale of government commitment\nresulting from BOT projects - in kind, as investment, or through guarantees (contingent\nliabilities) being called.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe absence of value-for-money analyses or before-and-after studies is striking.\n\na.\n\nImpact of the Economic Crisis\n\nWhile evidence is patchy, there is reason to believe that PSP processes are improving,\noften with the assistance of the major multilateral development banks. In the Philippines, ADB\nhas assisted government carry out a Transport Strategy Study, focused upon action to improve\nPSP sector-wide; and it is currently preparing a loan, providing capacity-building support to\ngovernment,  improving  PSP  processes  and  identifying  possible  hybrid  projects  for\nimplementation.\n\nIn Indonesia, the Government recognizes that in spite of many successes, past practices\nhad their shortcomings, and it is now actively reforming the legislative and regulatory frameworks,\nand improving the process of project identification and procurement. Presidential decree No. 7\napproved in January 1998 requires open competitive bidding for all infrastructure projects, that\nsuch projects should have been identified as priorities by Government, and that unsolicited bids\nwould also be subject to competitive bidding. ADB is providing loan assistance for a Transport\nStrategy Study to build upon these initiatives.\n\nIn  Malaysia,  the  Government  is  revisiting  its  PSP  processes,  in  particular  its  automatic\nunderwriting of bank loans, and is considering how to deal with the many project developers who\nhave applied for government financial assistance.\n\nThese are all promising signs that the window of opportunity which the economic crisis has\nopened is indeed being grasped. PSP processes are likely to be better suited to the future when\neconomic growth reasserts itself.\n\nb.\n\nOverall  Conclusion\n\nThe overall conclusion based upon all the case studies and other available evidence is\n\nthat:\n\nrealized.\n\n\u2022 Much  needs  to  change,  before  the  required  benefits  of  PSP  in  this  sector  are\n\n\u2022\n\nImplementing a successful BOT policy is very demanding \u2014 only Hong Kong, China in\nAsia achieves this, and nowhere else is yet close.\n\n\f\u2022\n\nThere is much to learn from the case studies, and these offer great potential to improve\nthe BOT process.\n\n\u2022 Other PSP modalities hold considerable promise, are less demanding to implement\nand may have more to offer than the BOT process, given the economic needs of most\nAsian countries, including the rehabilitation or improved maintenance of the existing\nroad network.\n\n\u2022 Events since the economic crisis offer hope that change is taking place.\n\n48\n\nIII. KEY ISSUES\n\nThis section of the report identifies the key issues established from the review of current\n\npractice, and the implications for best practices.\n\nA.\n\nExpressways are Different\n\nPSP in infrastructure was applied first in the power sector in most Asian countries. Usually\nthis was for power generation plants which could be sited remotely, and where the deal involved\nmodification to an existing concession contract. This model of privatization is still perceived to be\nsuccessful by many \u2014 albeit that it has now been widely superseded, for two reasons:\n\n\u2022\n\nFirst, because the contracts have not stood up to the recent economic crisis \u2014 they\nwere formulated without anticipating the large currency devaluations and the reduced\ndemand for power which has resulted.\n\n\u2022 Second, because the privatization of the power sector is now recognized as being far\nmore complex, first requiring consideration of the whole structure of the industry, and\nthen the development of a strategy for implementation of the inter-related elements.\n\nNevertheless, the expectations of many of the key players for BOT expressways are usually\nbenchmarked against this perception of success. Even in these terms however, the expectations\nof  success  are  misplaced  \u2013  because  expressways  are  seen  to  be  very  different  from  power\nstations (Table 14).\n\n\f49\n\nTable 14:  Characteristics of Power and Expressway Projects\n\n        CHARACTERISTIC                        POWER STATION\n\nEXPRESSWAY\n\nProject  Identification\n\nStraightforward\n\nDemanding  (not  all  expressways  ar\u2018good\u2019,\nproblems  with  competing  projects)\n\nCost\n\nHigh - but all costs up-front (operating costs are low)\n\nHigh - but costs spread over\nlife  (operating  costs  are  high)\n\nLocation\n\nRemote\n\nIn the middle of big cities, or major developed\ncorridors\n\nLand  requirements\n\nSmall: a single site for the\npower  station\n\nLarge: Often in central locations, often a continuous\nstrip  (difficult  acquisition)\n\nEnvironmental  impact\n\nSmall  (remote  location)\n\nIntegration  requirements\n\nConsiderable\n\nLarge for elevated structure, medium for others.\nInvolves  extensive  land  acquisition/relocation\n\nExtensive \u2014 traffic depends upon effective\nintegration  with  the  transport  system\n\nSame  (at  least  people\nalready pay for electricity)\n\nHuge: roads are \u2018free\u2019 to use\nThere is almost always a \u2018free alternative\u2019\nA separate negotiation for each project\n\nHigh - fixed from day 1\n\nLow in early years\n\nCertain (defined in the\nconcession  agreement)\n\nUncertain in the future (depends on external factors)\n\nFinancial Viability as a\nstand-alone  project.\n\nViable\n\nNot viable (only a few projects are viable)\n\nComplexity\n\nPower station output often\nlarge relative to demand\n\nExpressway small relative to the network.

Sponsors are concerned primarily that the project is financially\nviable  and  proceeds  (allowing  them  to  secure  short-term  construction  profits).  Bankers  are\nconcerned  to  ensure  their  loans  are  repaid.  In  some  instances,  repayment  is  guaranteed  by\ngovernment within concession agreements, but usually the banks are at some risk, and then\nthey are concerned with downside risk - specifically: what is the probability of the revenue stream\nbeing so low that repayment is threatened?\n\nNeither of these parties typically has an understanding of traffic and revenue forecasts.\n\n2.\n\nExpectations and Reality\n\nProject sponsors, and many bankers too, believe that it is not difficult to forecast traffic.\n\nThis report dispels that view, which is a principal cause for the problems in this sector.\n\nAlthough toll roads represent significant investments by developers (and often governments),\nthere seems little understanding of why some traffic uses a toll road whilst other traffic does not, or\nof the resistance to tolls by companies/drivers of all vehicle categories, or of the likely growth in\neither  traffic  or  revenues.  Rather,  there  is  a  widespread  belief  that  expressways  should  make\nmoney; and sometimes the forecasts are required to justify this.28\n\nRevenue  projections  are  too  often  based  on  forecasting  studies  which  are  severely\nlimited by time and budget constraints. This reveals ignorance of the complexities of traffic\nforecasting. Thus, it is usual for sponsors to invest a substantial amount in technical studies,\ncost estimation, and in financial and legal advisers; but only a small amount to determine the\nrevenue stream \u2014 on which expectations of profits and debt repayment principally depend.\nThis  failure  to  invest  adequately  in  traffic  studies  leads  to  the  lack  of  essential  information\nabout existing traffic characteristics in the proposed toll road corridor, and a simplified forecasting\nmodel using limited and sometimes poor inputs. The result is often very unrealistic outputs,\nwhich are misleadingly used to demonstrate the project\u2019s apparent financial viability.\n\nTraffic and revenue projections are typically developed as follows:\n\n\u2022\n\nTraffic  surveys  are  carried  out  in  the  corridor  of  the  proposed  toll  road,  usually\ncomprising some (but rarely all) of: traffic counts classified by vehicle type, origin-\ndestination  surveys,  stated  or  revealed  preference  surveys29 to  establish  users\u2019\nwillingness-to-pay tolls, and journey time surveys.\n\n\u2022 Other  data  are  collated  on  land  uses  (current  and  projected),  historic  traffic,  and\n\neconomic growth.\n\n28\n\n29\n\nWe  hasten  to  add  that  this  is  the  last  thing  a  professional  consultant  should  accept,  but  it  is  nevertheless  far  too  common  an\noccurrence.\nRevealed  preference  surveys  are  based  upon  observations  of  how  drivers  behave  when  faced  with  an  expressway\n(unfortunately  there  is  relatively  little  such  evidence).  Stated  preference  surveys  estimate  response  based  upon  surveys\nwith  potential  users,  who  are  presented  with  a  series  of  trade-off  questions.  Both  approaches  are  required,  additionally\ndrawing  upon  international  comparisons.\n\n\f   51\n\n\u2022 A  traffic-forecasting  model  is  developed,  validated  to  base  year  conditions,  which\nproduces traffic and revenue forecasts for a few specific future years, for a range of\nscenarios.\n\n\u2022 A revenue stream for the project concession period is developed by interpolation and\n\nextrapolation of the model revenue forecasts.\n\nThe forecasts require assumptions about generated traffic - new traffic not previously\nmade in the corridor, and resulting from the expressway - this may result in a significant addition\n(e.g., 10 percent - 20 percent) to traffic determined by the model. Simple forecasts are prepared\nfor economic growth and the growth in vehicle ownership, while government or other external\nforecasts  are  typically  used  for  population/land  use  (which  may  or  may  not  have  been  well\ndeveloped). Whilst forecasts are usually prepared for a limited number of separate vehicle classes\n(e.g., cars and goods vehicles) the number of vehicle classes is often less than the number of\ntolled categories which will be enforced when the toll road opens. Forecasts may be prepared for\ndifferent time periods during the day (especially in urban areas) but rarely cover weekends or\nholidays (instead traffic in these periods is incorporated in the annualization of daily revenues to\nannual totals).\n\nTable 15 summarizes the forecasts for selected tolled expressways:\n\nTable 15: Expressways - Comparison of Forecasts and Outturn Performance\n\nProject\n\nMalaysis  -  Singapore\nSecond  Crossing\n\nLahore  \u2013  Islamabad\nMotorway, Pakistan\n\nNorth-South\nExpressway,  Malaysia\n\nCar Toll\nUS cents\n30\n\n181\n\nTraffic \u2018000\nvehicles/day\n\nTraffic\ngrowth\n\nOutturn compared to\nForecast?\n\n10,000\n(incl.  motorcycles)\n\nn/a\n(just  opened) one third forecast\n\ntraffic haft forecast; revenues\n\n1.35/km\n\n4,000\n\nn/a\n\nTraffic half forecast; revenues\nless  than  one  third  forecast\n\n2.9/km\n\nup to 100,000\n\n10%  pa\n\nCorrectly forecast\n\nThis  sample  of  expressways  is,  in  our  experience,  typical  both  of  Asia  and  of  other\ndeveloping countries. It demonstrates a most important fact: that forecasts are usually high and\noptimistic.\n\na.\n\nThe Impact of an Expressway\n\nWhen a toll road opens, the following chain of events typically occur:\n\n\u2022\n\nThe toll road will parallel one or more existing roads, which appear to be congested. In\nfact, vehicle flows may be relatively low as much of the congestion may be caused by\nlow technology/low speed vehicles consuming much of the available capacity. Typically,\nexisting inter-urban roads may be carrying between 10,000\u201420,000 vehicles per day\n(vpd), with generally higher flows in urban areas. Of course, much of this traffic would\nnot use a toll road, e.g., low technology vehicles as above, motorcycles, local buses,\nmany goods vehicles.\n\n30\n\n Toll levied in each direction, by the Malaysian and Singaporean authorities.\n\n\f    52\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 When the toll road opens - except in urban areas or short sections of new road -traffic\ntakes time to find the new facility; this is referred to as the \u2018ramp-up\u2019 time, which may\nextend for up to several years.\n\nTolls on opening will usually have been determined by the developer and agreed with\ngovernment; depending on the process involved and the quality of the traffic forecasting\nstudies,  these  may  or  may  not  be  the  intended  optimum  (in  the  sense  of  either\nmaximizing revenues or achieving social goals). However, the scope for subsequently\nadjusting tolls is usually limited: examples where unrealistically high tolls were set\ninclude  both  the  Malaysia  -  Singapore  Second  Crossing  and  Lahore  -Islamabad\nMotorway.\n\n\u2022 Cars and buses are the most willing to pay tolls for time savings, goods vehicles and\nsome  taxis  are  the  most  resistant.  The  typical  composition  of  toll  road  traffic  is\noverwhelmingly cars (80 percent of traffic on Malaysia\u2019s North South Expressway, 65\npercent on the North Luzon Expressway in the Philippines, the JAGORAWI toll road in\nIndonesia, and the Lahore-lslamabad Motorway in Pakistan). As noted elsewhere, the\nPRC is different with private car traffic the exception.\n\nInitially, traffic is low relative to the road capacity \u2014 typically, it may be around 10,000\nvpd relative to a capacity of 60,000 vpd for a dual-2 lane road - i.e., about 15 percent of\ncapacity; and less for a dual-3 lane road.\n\nThe  diversion  of  traffic  onto  the  toll  road  may  come  from  other  corridors,  and  in\nextreme cases may be derived from other countries (for example, the M5 motorway\nin Hungary).\n\nThe diversion which occurs depends in part on the impact on capacity of the existing\nroads. A poorly designed elevated expressway, for example, can reduce capacity of\nthe  existing  road  (e.g.,  losing  one  lane  in  each  direction  to  allow  space  for  pier\nsupports).\n\nTraffic  growth  is  often  rapid  for  two  reasons:  firstly,  traffic  starts  from  a  low  base\n(during the ramp-up period); secondly, there is a generation effect in the sense of new\ntrips being made which were not made before the toll road opened. In practice, it is\ndifficult  to  quantify  either  effect  precisely,  but  together  they  can  lead  to  significant\ngrowth \u2014 observed traffic increases following opening on some well used roads are\nas follows:\n\n-\n\nJAGORAWI (Indonesia) -140 percent in four years.\n\n- Guangzhou - Foshan (PRC) - 180 percent in three years.\n\n- Malaysia North South Expressway (sections open in 1989) - up to 65 percent in\n\ntwo years.\n\n\u2022 Other effects can then act to sustain the high traffic growth rates. These include:\n\n(i)\nlonger-term generation effects as new developments move into the corridor as a\nresult of the improved accessibility provided by the toll road, (ii) network effects as other\nsections of the same route or of feeder routes open, and (iii) increasing congestion on\nunrelieved sections of the non-tolled alternative routes.\n\n\u2022 However, traffic growth is constrained by toll rate increases. These are often subject\nto  political i nterference  which  tends  to  favor  the  deferral  of  increases.  Therefore,\n\n\f    53\n\nwhen increases are allowed, they are then larger than originally planned. For example,\ntolls on Malaysia\u2019s North South Expressway are supposed to have increased at six\npercent per annum since 1988; in practice, tolls on cars have been increased by 50\npercent in 1993, 20 percent in 1996, 17 percent in 1997, and the six percent increase for\n1998 is currently deferred; while tolls on inter-urban roads in Indonesia have not been\nincreased between 1992 and 1997).\n\n\u2022\n\nFive years after opening, toll road traffic has typically increased to two to three times the\ntraffic level on opening (i.e., typically 30,000 vpd on important inter-urban roads). Traffic\non the existing road can be back to or even higher than the pre-toll traffic level (reflecting\nthe generally increased activity in the corridor as a whole resulting from the improved\naccessibility). Thus, the total corridor traffic may have increased by a factor of around\nthree.\n\nb.\n\nTariffs\n\nThere is considerable variation in tariffs. This variation is primarily between urban and inter-\nurban roads (with bridges/crossings as a separate highly tolled category), rather than between\ncountries.\n\nThe mark-up for heavy goods vehicles is around twice the car rate on well-used roads;\nhigher mark ups exist but only on roads where traffic levels are low. For buses (and taxis), Malaysia\nhas adopted a social policy which keeps tolls low - below that of cars - in order to help the mobility\nof the poorer sections of society.\n\nCurrent tariffs or proposed tariffs on a selection of toll roads are summarized in Table 16.\n\nTable 16: Tariffs on Toll Roads (US cents per vehicle)\n\n        Expressway\n\nCar                Small goods             Large goods                     Buses\n\nMalaysia: North South Expressway\nMalaysia: North South Central Link\nMalaysia\u2013Singapore:  Second\nCrossing\n\n2.9\n2.9\n181\n\n31\n\n4.2\n 4.2\n 411\n\n5.7\n5.7\n821\n\n 1.7\n   2.2\n   219\n\nPakistan:  Lahore  \u2013  Islamabad\nIndonesia: JAGORAWI\n\n2.0\n 2.2 (1997)\n\n3.6 - 4.5\n2.7 -3.8 (1997)\n\n   2.9\n2.7\u20133.8  (1997)\n\nIndonesia:  Jakarta  \u2013  Tangerang\n\n 2.6 (1997)\n\n4.1  (1997)\n\n  4.1 (1997)\n\nIndonesia:  Jakarta  \u2013  Cikampek\n\n 2.4 (1997)\n\n4.1 - 4.9 (1997)\n\n4.1  \u20134.9(1997)\n\n1.4\n2.2  (1997)\n1.1  (1998)\n2.6  (1997)\n1.3  (1998)\n2.4  (1997)\n1.2  (1998)\n5.5 - 8.2\n\nIndonesia:  Jakarta  Inner  Ring  Road\n(Urban)\nPhilippines:  South  Luzon\nExpressway  Extension  (Batangas)\nPhilippines  Skyway  (Urban)\nPRC: - typical rates\n\nProposed  2.0\n\n14.5\n3.0 - 7.0\n\n31\n\n Toll levied in each direction, by the Malaysian and Singaporean authorities.\n\n\f54\n\nc.\n\nForecasting  Errors\n\nMany traffic and revenue forecasts ignore some of the realities described above or are\n\nbased on key input assumptions which do not in fact occur. Typical errors include:\n\n\u2022 Data. The database is often constrained by budgets and time-scales so that it does\nnot include good origin-destination data or accurate traffic composition data (which\ncan  be  crucial  to  the  revenue  forecasts  given  the  different  toll  rates  by  vehicle\ncategory).\n\n\u2022 Model specification. Models can be poorly specified, especially those which estimate\nthe  willingness  of  drivers  to  pay  tolls,  leading  to  over-optimistic  assumptions  about\ndiversion rates to the toll road. There are technical issues concerning:\n\n-\n\nThe best methods to establish values of time. Stated intention surveys are often\nused  rather  than  stated  or  revealed  preference;  this  can  lead  to  serious\nmisjudgment.32\n\n- How these values of time are applied in the traffic model.\n\n- How growth in values of time should be estimated.\n\n\u2022 Model  inputs.  Simple  assumptions  are  generally  made  for  future  traffic  and\neconomic growth (these generally ignore short-term effects), interactions between\ntraffic  on  different  roads,  and  macro  developments  elsewhere.  The  derivation  of\nforecasts between model forecast years - often separated by 10 years or more -\ncan  ignore  key  events  such  as  other  projects  opening,  which  affect  traffic\ndisproportionately during this period. Often, no allowance is made for traffic ramp-\nup (i.e., the time it takes traffic to discover the new route).\n\n\u2022\n\nTariff  assumptions.  Forecasts  generally  assume  that  tariff  increases  (and  even\nthe  initial  tariffs)  will  occur  as  planned.  In  practice,  these  are  often  subject  to\nconsiderable political interference. Sensitivity tests rarely consider this issue, but\ninstead  tend  to  concentrate  on  variations  in  economic  and  traffic  growth,  and\ndiversion rates from existing roads.\n\n\u2022 Network assumptions. Governments may have a strategic plan for their highway\nnetwork,  but  this  may  not  be  used  to  determine  what  is  implemented.  Some  BOT\nprojects suffer from competition from other projects which are subsequently opened\nin the same corridor. The possibility and impact of competing infrastructure is often\noverlooked.\n\n32\n\nA  survey  of  goods  vehicle  drivers  outside  the  JAGORAWI  corridor  (south  of  Jakarta)  identified  80  percent  of  drivers\nwho  claimed  to  have  used  the  toll  road;  subsequent  surveys  within  the  corridor  revealed  that  only  around  40  percent\nactually used the toll road. The impact on the project finances was far greater than this, because goods vehicles were\nassumed  to  pay  far  higher  tolls  than  cars.\n\n\f55\n\nForecasting requires understanding and segmenting the travel market into homogeneous\nsub-markets with individual behavioral characteristics. In particular, it requires an understanding of\nhow traffic responds when faced with tolls.\n\n3.\n\nKey Issues\n\na.\n\nTariffs\n\nOnce a toll road has opened, we are not aware of any studies to establish whether the\nappropriate (i.e., revenue or social objective maximizing) tariff levels have or have not been set.\nThere is often little provision or opportunity to change toll levels post opening, even when an\nexpressway  is  clearly  performing  badly.  This  may  reflect  some  inflexibility  in  the  concession\nagreement or by the regulatory authority, but is mainly the result of the financial imperatives that\nmust be met by the developer/operator (who is usually unprepared to reduce tolls in case even\nthe small revenues that are being collected should be lost; or the potential for future increase is\nlost). So, to the question: \u2018Could revenues be increased by setting tolls better?\u2019 there is no clear\nanswer available.\n\nb.\n\nWillingness-to-Pay Tolls\n\nThe drivers of cars and motorcycles decide whether or not the toll is worth paying. For\nbuses the decision is made by the company - and because the benefits are usually high (in terms\nof improved utilization of the bus, and the increased tariff which may be chargeable) and the costs\nlow (the toll is divided between all passengers) most inter-city buses use toll roads.\n\nHowever,  for  goods  vehicles  it  is  a  more  complex  issue,  and  the  use  of  the  toll  road\n\ndepends upon:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe structure of the industry. The more it comprises small owner-operated or leased\nvehicles, the less likely is the toll road to be used - because such vehicles rarely have\nback-loads,  and  in  practice  may  expect  to  spend  several  days  before  returning  to\nbase. Not surprisingly, their value of time is very low. This is common in developing\ncountries.\n\nThe  form  of  payment.  Some  operators  market  tokens  to  large  companies,  which\nensures that drivers actually use the toll road (as opposed to pocketing the payment\nand avoiding it).\n\nThe  choice  in  each  case  is  between  the  perceived  cost  of  the  expressway  and  the\nexisting road. This cost may include illicit payments to police, provincial taxes, bridge or other\ntolls,  as  well  as  long  journey  times.  Some  of  these  \u2018unexpected\u2019  costs  may  be  faced  on\nexpressways too, negating part of their advantage.\n\nWhere the marginal costs of tolls is relatively unimportant (and especially if the expressway\nforms only a small part of the route but offers large time savings), operators have an opportunity to\nset high tolls. However, this needs to be a decision based on an informed understanding of the\nmarket traveling in their corridor.\n\nc.\n\nIntegration with the Highway Network\n\nThere is a tendency for the expressway to be seen as an end in itself, yet the traffic it carries\nis  affected  very  substantially  by  the  success,  or  otherwise,  with  which  it  is  integrated  into  the\nexisting road network.\n\n\f56\n\nFactors that are important are:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nJunction  locations  and  design  -  unless  traffic  can  access  the  expressway  readily,  it\nmay be deterred from using it.\n\n\u2022 Road improvements in and near the expressway corridor. These may be outside the\ninfluence of the concessionaire, yet they can impact substantially on its traffic. This\nwas a major problem on the Don Muang Tollway in Bangkok (in which the Government\nhas now had to invest).\n\nIntegration faced with other competing expressways. This concerns physical integration,\nand tariff integration, and is considered below.\n\nA BOT road stands a better chance of success if it is part of a wider strategic network into\nwhich it is well integrated. The North South Expressway in Malaysia is a good example of a strategic\nroute of national importance; even rural sections, which are directly tied into the rest of the route,\ncarried significant traffic volumes on opening (typically at least 20,000 vpd).\n\nd.\n\nMarketing\n\nLittle marketing seems to be carried out at present, and there are few toll roads where rates\nare varied by time of day, or offer concessions for regular use, or operate widespread prepayment\ndeals. There are significant opportunities for action in these areas, even where an expressway is\nreliant on manual toll collection methods.\n\ne.\n\nUncertainty and the Treatment of Risk\n\nImplementation and operation of an expressway in a developing country environment faces\n\nmany risks. There are, however, two issues which should be highlighted here:\n\nIt is clearly the case, that uncertainty in the revenue stream is much larger than in the\ncosts, yet it is the latter that receives the main attention.\n\nThere is surprisingly little attention given to comprehensive risk assessment.\n\nGovernment should be very concerned, but largely ignores risk (save to ensure that excess\nprofits are not made). Developers are usually contractors, concerned primarily with construction\nrisks rather than other downstream uncertainties (which they do not expect to face, having exited\nthe project after opening). While lenders are usually33 concerned with the downside risks, but\nthey often examine these issues late in the planning process, by which time developers and\ngovernments  have  become  committed  to  the  scheme  and  the  project  has  developed  an\nunstoppable momentum of its own. Lenders (and their advisers) are usually under considerable\npressure not to halt progress or kill the project at the eleventh hour.\n\nIn summary, it is the case that only rarely are project risks addressed comprehensively and\n\nearly enough to influence the project specification, staging, etc.\n\n33     \n\nExcept  where  they  are  underwritten  by  government,  as  in  Malaysia,  where  they  have  -  until  the  current  crisis  -  been  little\ninterested in risk.\n\n\f57\n\n4.\n\nToll  Revenues\n\na.\n\nObjectives\n\nTypically 95 percent of the revenues from a toll road result from tolls; with the remaining\nfive percent from advertising and small concessions; so securing the revenue from traffic using\na toll road is of critical importance. It is interesting that it is the banks who often seem more\ninterested in this than the concessionaires.\n\nThe purpose of tolling is to maximize net revenues (revenues less the costs of tolling). The\n\nfactors involved are:\n\n\u2022 Maximizing  the  quality  of  service  offered  to  customers  (avoiding  frequent  stops  for\npayment  at  one  extreme,  and  any  stops  at  the  other,  while  simultaneously  making\npayment easy. This maximizes traffic and the willingness-to-pay of users.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFor companies owning trucks/vans, their objective is to ensure that the payments they\nmake, result in their vehicles actually using the toll road (i.e., that the driver does not\npocket the toll). Some tolling systems can guarantee this \u2014 which is strongly to the\nadvantage of the concessionaire too.\n\nThe need for land-take (for tollbooths) and the capital and operating costs of tolling\nsystems need careful assessment.\n\nb.\n\nTolling Systems\n\nThese are categorized as:\n\n\u2022 Open, closed or hybrid (the latter being part open, part closed). Generally, open toll\nsystems are used in urban or semi-urban areas where traffic flows are high and there\nare numerous entry/exit points along the toll road which it is difficult/costly to control;\nwhile closed systems tend to be used on inter-urban roads with limited access. But\nthese are not hard and fast rules.\n\n\u2022 Closed systems ensure that all toll road users are charged a toll directly related to\ntheir usage of the toll road. Open systems do not charge all users (only those passing\nthrough the tollgates) and the charge is the same irrespective of journey length; as\nsuch they do not collect all the potential revenues. However, their operating costs are\nlower and there are fewer delays to traffic.\n\n\u2022 A well-designed open system can achieve most of the revenues of a closed system,\nbut there will inevitably be some leakage. This needs to be minimized by careful design\nand analysis of trip patterns and route choices.\n\n\u2022 Single lane/manual collection, or electronic or mixed - where regular users have tags\nand are required to slow down only at the toll gates (to 10kph-15kph). There are more\nthat one hundred such systems worldwide.\n\n\u2022\n\nFree flow multi-lane all electronic.\n\nToday in Asia, all systems are relatively simple, usually requiring drivers to stop for payment\nat toll-gates, but with several examples of exclusive lanes for regular users with tags, for example,\nin Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; and Bangkok.\n\n\f58\n\nc.\n\nElectronic Systems\n\nThe key aspects of these advanced systems are as follows:\n\n\u2022\n\nThe technology: this is now proven, but not perfect, even for complex multi-lane solutions.\n\n\u2022 A EU/international (CEN/ISO) standard exists for the vehicle to roadside communications,\nsupported by competing manufacturers (in use in Austria, Australia, etc., but not yet\nimplemented in the US).\n\n\u2022 Devising strategies which both provide support for irregular users, and enforce penalties\n\nagainst people who do not intend to pay.\n\nThe technology typically comprises:\n\n\u2022 A tag in the center of the vehicle windscreen, conforming to the EU standard, is the\nsimplest method, and is no more than an identification card. An in-vehicle smart card\nsystem complicates the design (due to more sophisticated strategies which are required\nto reliably enforce payment violations).\n\n\u2022\n\nTag-to-overhead beacon communications, now reliable (provided the tags are working\nand fitted properly \u2014 making fitting every vehicle highly desirable.\n\n\u2022 Overhead  equipment  which  detects  a  vehicle,  captures  the  registration  number  (by\ntaking an electronic image of the number plate), and classifies the vehicle by length/\nheight/width.\n\n\u2022 Roadside computers linked to a central computer/database which results in any of the\n\nfollowing courses of action:\n\n- Notifies the central computer of a \u2018successful\u2019 payment using the tag.\n\n- Notifies the central computer of a \u2018successful\u2019 payment from an irregular user (no\n\ntag).\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- Organizes billing.\n\nIdentifies no pay where the tag is not functioning (for follow up).\n\nIdentifies no pay where there is a willingness to evade.\n\nThe  key  to  the  enforcement  of  non-payers  is  an  understanding  of  the  customer-base  -\nhence an ability to separate deliberate avoiders (multiple offenders) from good customers with\noccasional problems (maybe due to tag failure). The technology allows reliable classification into\nthree categories:\n\nThose who pay - success.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThose who choose not to pay (repeated defaulters).\n\nThose who do not - probably because the tag is badly installed (occasional defaulter).\n\n\f    59\n\nA large penalty is required for offenders.\n\nEnforcement depends upon having accurate records of car owners\u2019 addresses. If these\ndon\u2019t exist, then electronic systems (such as speed/red light camera enforcement) will not work.\n\nd.\n\nRegulatory/Legal  Requirements\n\nThe key bodies involved are the concessionaire, the state legal authorities (police, courts),\n\nand the road authority.\n\nIf a law is passed  (as  in  Singapore) requiring a car to have a tag, then enforcement is\nrelatively straightforward (it is an offense not to have a tag, and as such the technical problems of\ndealing with valid unequipped users is avoided). Moreover, the tag can incorporate the vehicle tax,\nallowing tax evaders to be simply traced. But this is the exception at present.\n\nAny  toll  road  needs  regulations  to  exist.  Legislation  is  required  to  cover  the  following\n\nissues:\n\n\u2022 Collect tolls.\n\n\u2022 Sign the toll road, from the existing roads.\n\n\u2022 Control advertising along the toll road.\n\n\u2022 Define operational procedures - access for emergency vehicles (who is responsible for\n\nwhat?).\n\n\u2022\n\nIssues of privacy: whether an electronic photograph of a number-plate will be accepted\nby courts; defining the approval process for such equipment, or defining what information\ncan be disclosed to whom under what circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Defining  the  right  to  enforce  for  non-payment,  with  penalties  that  make  violation\nunattractive (who is the enforcing agency, is it a civil or criminal offense). Non-renewal\nof annual vehicle licenses for outstanding penalties is one option.\n\ne.\n\nInter-operability\n\nHow can systems work in a network which comprises different concessionaires? The answer\n\nis likely to be that:\n\n\u2022 All systems should use the same EU standard tag. This can be used to bill different\nconcessionaires, with different accounts. This is the most likely scenario (usually, as in\nFrance and Germany, there is a single dominant operator).\n\n\u2022 Alternatively and additionally, adopt single billing for the convenience of customers.\nThis  requires  a  clearing  house  with  revenues  allocated  on  the  basis  of  clear\nguidelines.  No  such  system  is  known  to  exist,  although  Malaysia/Klang  Valley  is\nlooking at such a system.\n\n\f60\n\nf.\n\nCosts\n\nAn example: Melbourne CityLink - the costs for one project, which is pioneering the effective use\n\nof electronic technology are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Construction cost for the expressway are US$0.8 billion excluding financing, and US$1.1\n\nbillion including financing.\n\n\u2022 Contract for all electronic tolling equipment: US$40 million. The technology therefore costs\n\nabout five percent - six percent of the cost.\n\n\u2022\n\nTags cost about US$30 each. The concessionaire pays for them (600,000 in total34) -\nthey are given to customers when they open their account.\n\nFor a more typical project the electronic tolling system might cost say four percent of total cost\n\n(Melbourne has costly tunnels).\n\ng.\n\nApplicability of Tolling Systems to Developing Country Environments\n\nExperience may be simply summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Existing practices are often primitive - there is little doubt that electronic techniques will\n\nincreasingly be applied.\n\n\u2022 Electronic systems have great potential to maximize revenues: by providing an attractive\nlevel of service on the expressway, and a convenient payment system by providing\nflexibility to change tariffs - by time of day (peaking) or over time; and by securing trucking\nrevenues etc.\n\nThe tolling strategy has to be carefully designed (there are many subtle pitfalls).\n\nTolling always requires legislative/regulatory requirements which must be enacted in law.\n\n\u2022 Electronic systems require information about vehicle owners\u2019 addresses, for enforcement.\nWhere  this  is  insufficient,  or  enforcement  is  likely  to  be  poor,  manual  systems  are  still\nnecessary.\n\nInter-operability is relatively easy to provide with electronic systems - by requiring use of\nEU standard tags. For manual systems it is not - repeated stopping is probably necessary\n(unless  a  clearing  house  can  be  set  up  \u2014  which  is  unlikely  in  most  commercial\nenvironments).\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n 34  1 million customers, 700 thousand transactions per day.\n\n\f61\n\n5.\n\nNon-Toll  Revenues\n\nMany assume that there are other sources of funds that the private sector can capture, other\nthan tolls from motorists, but this is only rarely so. Typically, five percent of gross revenues come from\nother sources - primarily advertising and concessions.\n\nProperty profits are usually held out as the great hope, on the grounds that the expressway itself\nincreases land values near interchanges, and results in development gain. This is often so, but the\nproblems in capturing it are substantial.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe first problem is that the profits are unpredictable (all property markets typically exhibit\nboom-and-bust cycles). If property gain underpins the project finances, it follows that the\ntiming  of  the  project  is  determined  by  the  property  cycle  -  which  does  not  fit  with  the\nrequirements of government\u2019s procurement processes.\n\n\u2022 Secondly, land deals are not always straightforward and it is sometimes difficult (e.g., in\nPRC) to know who owns the land and what is happening. This makes it risky to depend\non such deals.\n\n\u2022\n\nFor these reasons, banks are usually unwilling to accept such forecasts of property profits\nas a component of a funding package, instead they assume they are zero.\n\nC.\n\nSector  Policies\n\n1.\n\nPolicy  Overview\n\na.\n\nThe Need for a Change in Direction\n\nTransport infrastructure provides essential access to jobs, education and health facilities\nand  is  crucial  to  economic  activity.  It  is  necessary  for  development.  Changing  economic\ncircumstances and social aspirations are changing the way we use transport infrastructure and\nhow we need to plan its development. Sustainability in economic, financial, environmental and\nsocial terms is now high on the agenda, and these re-defined objectives underpin a new approach\nto the provision of transport infrastructure. The traditional approach of provision by the public\nsector is disappearing. It is being replaced by an increasing involvement of the private sector,\nto  achieve  a  more  responsive  transport  sector,  which,  crucially,  has  to  be  given  the  right\nsignals to respond to.\n\nThere are compelling economic and financial35 reasons to involve the private sector in the\n\nfunding and operation of the roads sector.\n\nThe  traditional  approach  to  the  provision  of  transport  infrastructure  and  services  has\nbeen based on detailed government intervention. Infrastructure has normally been provided\ndirectly by the state and the state has either directly provided transport services or heavily\n\n35 This  section  distinguishes  between  \u2018economic\u2019  and  \u2018financial\u2019  impacts.  The  former  includes  all  of  the  project  impacts\n(both  those  which  are  costs  and  revenues,  and  all  others);  while  financial  impacts  include  only  the  costs  and\nrevenues.\n\n\f62\n\nregulated privately provided services, usually controlling entry to the market, product characteristics,\nprice levels and maximum profit rates.\n\nThe  critical  weakness  of  this  traditional  approach  is  clearly  shown  in  the  World  Bank\npublication Sustainable Transport: Policies for Reform, 1996. It is the absence of incentives to\nensure that infrastructure and services provided are in tune with market requirements, the public\ninterest. The absence of competition leads to excess, monopoly profits, inefficiency in provision,\nand failure to respond to the needs of the market. The report explicitly defines government\u2019s central\nrole  succinctly:  \u2018The  basis  for  increasing  economic  sustainability  in  transport  is  to  create  a\ncompetitive, market-based transport sector\u2019.\n\nFor this objective to be fulfilled with regard to the roads sector, the private sector has to be\ninvolved in their provision within a regulatory framework that delivers the effects of competition.\nIdeally, prices would be set at levels which send effective signals to transport system users and\nthose making investment decisions.\n\nHowever, experience of PSP to date has raised many issues. ADB is particularly concerned\nthat,  in  some  instances,  corruption  has  distorted  the  impacts  of  the  policy,  and  that  social  and\nenvironmental consequences have not been addressed.\n\nb.\n\nStrategy for Attracting PSP\n\nFigure  1  summarizes  the  strategy  that  needs  to  be  followed  if  PSP  in  funding  transport\n\ninfrastructure is to be effective. Its key features are:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe objective (to the right of the figure) is to provide improved services to passengers\nand operators that are available and reliable, that offer choice and that are competitively\npriced.\n\n\u2022 Political will is the essential starting point. Investors and lenders need to be sure that\ngovernments  are  committed  to  PSP,  and  to  the  private  sector  collecting  tolls  and\nrepatriating debt service costs and returns on investment.\n\n\u2022 An institutional framework which offers the private sector a level playing field is required.\nThe  public  and  private  sector  must  operate  on  the  same  basis:  an  independent\nregulatory  body  and  framework  is  now  required  (the  same  body  cannot  be  both\nprovider/operator and regulator).\n\nThe right regulatory and pricing policies are needed, to create competitive markets.\nMarket  access  must  be  guaranteed,  monopoly  practices  controlled  and  safety\nstandards enforced. Freedom in tariff setting is required to ensure that - as far as\npossible  -  users  pay  the  full  costs  to  society  of  their  use  of  infrastructure  and\nservices.  Where  tariffs  are  kept  low  and  are  supported,  the  existence  of  the\ngovernment support has to be identified and governments forced to decide whether\nthe support should continue.\n\nSuch a framework will send the right signals to investors and lenders, encouraging their\ninvolvement  in  funding,  building  and  operating  transport  projects.  All  of  the  components  of  the\nstrategy need to be in place: the absence of any will discourage involvement, no matter how attractive\nthe projects may be.\n\n\fFigure 1:       Philippines - Strategy for Attracting PSP\n\nPRIVATE  SECTOR\n\nt\n\nt\n\n-   Finance\n-   Entrepreneurial Skills\n\nPOLITICAL\nWILL\n\n(Clarity\nof\nPurpose)\n\nInstitutional\nRestructing\n\nGovernemnt\nfunction:\n  \u2022  purchaser\n\n  \u2022  facilitator\n\nIndependent\nRegulation\n\nPOLICY\n\nTransport\nStrategy\n\nRegulatory\nPolicy\n\nTariff\nLiberalisation\n\nBOT\nConcessions\nPolicy\n\nt\n\nFUNDING\n\nBOT\n\nOther  user\ncharge\n\nGovernment\nbudget\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nSERVICE\n\n-  Availability\n\n-  Price\n\n-  Choice\n\n-  Quality\n\nPROJECTS\n\n6\n3\n\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\n\f    64\n\nc.\n\nPreventing  Corruption\n\nThere is understandable concern that in some cases, the private-sector approach has led to\ncorruption  and  nepotism,  which  has  seriously  undermined  the  approach.  This  was  based  on  the\nassumption by private groups that even in a chaotic environment, they could make money from such\nconcessions.\n\nHowever,  the  experience  is  that  in  practice  very  few  have  made  money  out  of  such\nprojects, and there is a growing recognition that the current PSP process in most countries\nserves no-one\u2019s interests.\n\nMoreover, the current economic crisis has reinforced government\u2019s commitment to make\nthe procurement and regulatory processes more truly competitive and transparent. Change has\nbeen forced by the need to attract private finance, and the international competition for such\nfinance.\n\nThe  agenda  for  the  future  is  to  translate  these  objectives  into  effective  action,  in  the\nknowledge that there is a growing constituency of support in both the public and private sectors\nfor such changes.\n\nd.\n\nFunding the Transport Sector\n\nThe principles of public sector pricing and taxation have been difficult to implement in\nthe transport sector in most developing countries. In addition, it has been difficult to charge\nroad users at the point-of-use for use of the road network. Because of this difficulty, the sector\nremains under-funded, having to rely on a share of general public funds rather than generating\nits own funds. Moreover, road funds are not secure; they are typically raided by governments\nwith many demands and constrained resources. The result is no security in funding even for\nmaintaining  the  basic  road  assets,  and  frequent  disinvestment  -  where  costs  incurred  to\nrehabilitate  the  road  structure  and  pavement  are  many  times  those  that  good  maintenance\nwould have required.\n\nEconomic efficiency is served by setting prices equal to the full cost of an activity. In the case of\n\nthe use of expressways, prices should cover:\n\nThe road user\u2019s own costs of vehicle operation.\n\nThe marginal costs imposed on the provider of the expressway, particularly damage to the\ncarriageway.\n\n\u2022 External  costs,  particularly  in  terms  of  congestion  costs  (delays  and  additional  vehicle\n\noperating costs) and environmental costs.\n\nIn  the  absence  of  a  mechanism  for  imposing  direct  charges  for  road  use,  the  most\nappropriate way of approximating these costs is by incorporating them in fuel prices (see the\naforementioned World Bank Publication entitled Sustainable Transport). Fuel prices should be\nset to cover:\n\nIts resource cost - normally the import (or export) price.\n\nIts  environmental  impact,  mainly  its  impact  upon  air  pollution  (including  global\nwarming).\n\nThe proxy road-user charge - which should reflect the cost of using the infrastructure.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\fFigure 2:      Fuel Price in Different Countries (Premium Gasoline\n\nPUMP PRICES FOR PREMIUM GASOLINE\n\nDeveloping\neconomies\n\nIndustrial\neconomies\n\nJapan\n\n65\n\n5.25\n\n5.00\n\n4.75\n\n4.50\n\n4.25\n\n4.00\n\n3.75\n\n3.50\n\n3.25\n\n3.00\n\n2.75\n\n2.50\n\n2.25\n\n2.00\n\n1.75\n\n1.50\n\n1.25\n\n1.00\n\n0.75\n\n0.50\n\n0.25\n\n0.00\n\nSuriname\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nUruguay\nBarbado\n\nCroatia\nArgentina\nHungary\nSingapor\nNicaragua\n\nTaipei, China\n\nPero, Bolivia\n\nAntigua\nPoland, El Salvador\nDeveloping  country  average  ($1.87)\nParaguay\n\nGrenada\n\nChile\n\nPanama\n\nMalaysia, Trinidad\nGuatemala\n\nGhana\nHonduras\nIndonesia, Benin Philippines, Ecuador\nCosta Rica, Vietman\n\nColombia\n\nMozambique\n\nThailand\nPRC\n\nRussia\n\nVenezuela\n\nSource:  Energy  Detente  (1994);  World  Bank.\n\nNorway\n\nNetherlands\n\nSweden\n\nItaly\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance, Hong Kong\n\nWestern  European  average  ($3.69)\n\nPortugal\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nAustria Ireland\n\nFinland, Luxembourg, Greece\n\nSpain\n\nIsrael\nNew  Zealand\n\nAustralia\n\nCanada\n\nUnited State\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\f66\n\nFigure 2 demonstrates that fuel prices in most Asian countries are substantially below\n(only one third of) the average in industrial economies. The World Bank estimate that European\nprices are likely to be a more appropriate benchmark for developing Countries than the very low\nprices  found  in  US  \u2014  if  this  is  the  principal  mechanism  of  recouping  the  costs  imposed  on\nsociety by road transport.\n\nA critical first step is, therefore, to increase fuel prices so that they better represent the\nfull costs of fuel use. At a stroke, this would provide a more efficient use of resources in the\ntransport sector, and generate funds, the user-charge component of which should be dedicated\nto the roads sector. This is necessary, because there is no other available option, and without it\nthe road sector in developing countries will remain seriously under-funded, and there will be no\nincentives to drivers in using their cars (the reason why congestion is widespread today).\n\nA combination of fuel prices set in this way, and direct charges for the additional benefits\noffered by high-quality facilities such as many expressways, represents an appropriate development\nof transport sector pricing policies.\n\n2.\n\nAppraisal of Expressways\n\na.\n\nObjectives\n\nTable  11  summarized  the  objectives  of  expressways  under  four  criteria:  economic\nefficiency,  development,  social,  and  environment.  The  case  studies  demonstrated  that  while\neconomic efficiency was always central to proposals, and development sometimes (in Malaysia\nand Hong Kong, China), social objectives were addressed only in Malaysia and environmental\nimpacts were little mentioned.\n\nMany arguments are put forward in support of expressways, they are usually considered\nto be the obvious response to serious traffic congestion. The fact of this problem is obvious, and\nthe  prospect  of  it  becoming  more  serious  is  equally  obvious.  But  the  following  questions  are\nrarely asked, before drawing the conclusion that expressways are the right answer:\n\n\u2022 Do expressways solve traffic congestion problems? It is often assumed that this is\nso, yet particularly in big cities - in Bangkok, Tokyo, or Seoul, all of which have large\nexpressway networks, it is clear that (alone) they do not. The answer may be \u2018yes\u2019,\nparticularly  in  inter-urban  corridors,  but  it  is  not  self-evidently  so.  Sometimes  an\nexpressway is clearly the wrong response.\n\n\u2022 What other impacts do expressways have? Do they promote a sustainable form of\ndevelopment,  are  they  environmentally  sustainable?  The  answer  depends  upon\ncircumstance, but some projects clearly distort strategy.\n\n\u2022\n\nIs an expressway affordable (if it is not, it cannot be implemented, however bad the\nproblem). This question is rarely asked \u2014 instead, expressways are assumed to be\nprofitable, and therefore free to the public sector. But unfortunately this is only rarely\nso.\n\nIt may be asked what is the alternative? The conclusion throughout the world is that the\nanswer  to  the  pervasive  problems  created  by  traffic  congestion  requires  a  combination  of\nmanagement policies for the existing network, improved public transport in urban areas, and\n\n\f67\n\nnew road construction which targets identified problems and helps structure land development. In\nshort, expressways have their place, but particularly in urban areas, this needs to be part of a\nbalanced transport strategy.\n\nIt  may  also  be  asked  what  role  exists  for  the  private  sector,  if  expressways  are  not\nappropriate. The answer is increasingly recognized to be very substantial. For example, it may\nwell be that in the medium-term, the management of the whole main road system is concessioned\nout to private sector operating companies, creating a major new business opportunity for the\nprivate sector. The focus of such concessions will increasingly be on the management of existing\nassets, rather than creating new capacity.\n\nb.\n\nThe Nature of Expressways\n\nThis report defines expressways as controlled-access roads, from which a revenue stream\nmay be secured, by tolling or through shadow-tolls. Expressways are what economists refer to as\n\u2018semi-private goods\u2019, and this has important implications.\n\nSimply,36 private goods can be produced by either the private or the public sector; and public\n\ngoods can be produced by the public sector, or by the private sector in many cases.\n\nA private good is one supplied in a form that involves:\n\n\u2022 Excludability \u2013 supply is provided for particular customers (there are no free-riders).\n\n\u2022 Subtractability \u2013 supply to one customer reduces supply to other customers.\n\nThus, power and water delivered to a house, office or factory is excludable and, at a given\n\ncapacity, subtractable.\n\nRoads are generally public goods, being both non-excludable and non-subtractable. But\nthey can be converted into private goods through regulation and charging \u2013 as long as the costs of\ndoing this (the transaction costs) are not too high. In practice, the costs of contracting, charging,\nand enforcement would be far too high for the road network as a whole, and many of the economic\nbenefits would be lost.\n\nBut some roads can be made semi-private through controlling their access. Some of their\npotential customers (non-motorized etc.) are excluded, but they are not fully subtractable - their\nuse by one authorized user does not prevent use by others. Access-controlled roads generally\nprovide a high level of service, for which users are willing, and should, pay.\n\nc.\n\nFinancing Expressways\n\nControlled  access  roads  provide  a  better  service,  and  beneficiaries  should  pay.  When  the\nbeneficiaries are also tolled, there is some loss of benefits. The contracting, tolling and enforcement\ncosts of tolling should be reduced as far as possible to reduce this loss in benefits.\n\n36 We refer here to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.\n\n\f68\n\nThe semi-private characteristic of expressways provides one argument for some public funding.\nThe other is that the roads generate benefits for people on the existing roads (who do not pay towards\nthe cost of the expressway) through de-congestion, etc., and government should be prepared to pay to\nsecure these benefits.37\n\nd.\n\nProfitability\n\nAn expressway is defined in this report as \u2018profitable\u2019 if the (almost entirely toll) revenues\ncan finance the full cost of implementation (project development, land acquisition and construction),\ntogether  with  operating  and  asset  replacement  costs  \u2014  and  provide  an  acceptable  return  to\nshareholders.\n\nAt first glance, it would \u2014 contrary to the widely-held view \u2014 be surprising if expressways\n\nwere profitable. Because expressways benefit two categories of people:\n\nThose who use them - and pay towards their cost.\n\nThose who do not use them, and instead travel along the de-congested parallel free road,\nand do not pay towards their cost.\n\nThe economic evaluation captures both these categories of benefit, but the financial evaluation\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nonly the former.\n\nThe  evidence  summarized  in  this  report  is  compelling.  Throughout  the  world,  not  only  in\ndeveloping countries, very few expressways are profitable given this definition. In the four case study\ncountries, it is estimated that between three and five projects may be profitable (defined as above),\nout of a large number.\n\ne.\n\nThe PRC is Different\n\nAs  described  in  Appendix  2,  only  the  PRC  is  different,  for  understandable  reasons.\nHere, costs are kept extremely low (the roads in question are inter-urban, and are constructed,\noperated and maintained using local inputs), the existing \u2018 alternativ \u2019 routes are very poor and\ncongested, traffic growth is rapid, and for many journeys the toll is only a small part of the total\nperceived cost of the journey.\n\nThe firm conclusion for everywhere other than the PRC is that expressways require\ngovernment support/investment in order to create profitability for PSP. This may be in the form\nof an existing road asset, which is handed \u2018free\u2019 to the private concessionaire. Or it may be in\nthe form of government guarantees, which \u2014 if they are called (because, for example, expected\ntraffic has not materialized) then requires actual government investment.\n\n  37   Arguably otherwise government would have to invest in alternative projects to secure the benefits.\n\n\f69\n\nf.\n\nThe Impact of Country Income on Profitability\n\nThere  is  a prima facie reason  to  expect  that  profitability  will  increase  with  incomes.\nThis is because while revenues should increase at least proportionately (as willingness-to-pay\nincreases proportionately, as traffic growth increases at least proportionately, and as congestion\non the free alternative route rapidly increases), costs should not increase. Their labor component\ncost will increase, but materials and energy costs are traded commodities, and should not.\nTypically, construction costs are estimated to rise at about one-third to one-half of the increase\nin income. The result is illustrated in Figure 3. There is one caveat - expressways in big cities\ncan incur very high land costs - up to one-half of their cost when on a new alignment, but this\nis not the norm.\n\nThe implications are important:\n\ngovernment.\n\n\u2022 As incomes increase, expressways become more affordable to both their users and to\n\n\u2022 Conversely, they are unlikely to be feasible where incomes are low.\n\ng.\n\nThe Implications of Non-Profitability\n\nThe implications should be obvious, but are not always appreciated. They are that:\n\n\u2022 BOT expressways are costly - typical costs are in the range US$0.25 billion-US$1 .0\n\nbillion.\n\n\u2022\n\nThey mobilize large private funds, but only at the cost of large public funds - a government\ninvestment requirement of US$0.1 billion - 0.4 billion in just one project is not unusual.\n\n\u2022 Public funds are scarce - the annual public sector budget for the whole transport sector\n(roads, ports, airports, and rail) in the whole of the Philippines is currently just US$1\nbillion.\n\nThere  is,  therefore,  a  concern  that  BOT  projects  will  inadvertently  (because  projects  are\nwidely thought to be profitable) pre-empt resources - maybe on a massive scale - which should\ninstead be invested in:\n\n\u2022 Other  higher-priority  investments  in  the  same  city  or  inter-urban  corridor  (traffic\n\nmanagement, secondary roads, developmental roads, bus facilities etc.).\n\n\u2022 Other disadvantaged areas. BOT projects are always concentrated where the traffic flows\nare high. This is usually in the capital city, or for the radial roads leading to it. Government\nusually has development objectives for other regions and provinces, for which it requires\nfunds. If these are pre-empted by investment in so-called private roads elsewhere then\nplans can be undermined.\n\nThere is a further issue, which arises particularly in big cities - where many of Asia\u2019s BOT\nprojects  have  been  built.  Land  costs  can  become  a  very  important  component  of  expressway\ncosts, which naturally leads to low-cost corridors being used. These are almost always existing\nmajor  arteries,  and  the  expressway  reinforces  the  existing  concentration  along  a  few  big\n\n\f    70\n\ncorridors. This would be fine if government was developing other arteries, necessary to open up land\nfor efficient development. But this rarely happens, and one reason is that public funds are\nconcentrated in supporting BOT projects.\n\nTherefore, a central message for planners is that the public component of BOT projects\nneeds to be evaluated against the other competing priorities before committing to such projects. BOT\nprojects will not always be a rational use of government resources.\n\nTherefore, private funding should be considered additional to public funding. But in practice it\ncan only be so when economic analysis determines that the project has a high priority, and that the\npublic investment required can be rationally justified against competing priorities.\n\nFigure 3: ToIl Road Finances and Income\n\nCountry\nIncome\nLevel\n\nCost\n\nRequirement for\nGovernment Support\n\ns\n\ne\n\nu\n\nn\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nR\n\n\u201cProfitable\u201d\nProjects\n\n\u201cProfitable\u201d\nProjects\n\nExpressway cost and revenues\n\n\f71\n\nh.\n\nRole and Scope of the Economic Evaluation\n\nThe  public  sector  has  an  obligation  to  ensure  that  the  development  of  the  nation\u2019s\ninfrastructure,  including  its  road  network,  fulfills  economic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social\nsustainability criteria. The economic appraisal of projects is a crucial public sector responsibility.\nAppropriate valuation of impacts should include social factors (e.g., the distributional impacts of a\nscheme) and some environmental impacts (others are incorporated outside it) - factors with which\nthe private sector will have no concern.\n\nThe  public  sector  should  ensure  that  any  proposed  concession  is  an  important  and\nworthwhile use of funds. It should estimate EIRR and net present value (NPV) of the project not just\nto ensure that these are acceptable but also to ensure:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThat in a financially constrained environment, the project\u2019s NPV per unit of capital cost\nranks it sufficiently highly to warrant the use of public funds.\n\nThat the project as it will be implemented, with an appropriate toll structure, generates\nan appropriate EIRR or NPV.\n\nIt is not acceptable that the project solely exceeds government\u2019s test discount rate (typically\n10\u201312 percent in developing countries) \u2014 because far more projects exceed this threshold than\nthe public funds allow to be implemented (i.e., it is solely a threshold, which ensures that projects\nare not bad). Neither should the public sector accept projects that are financially viable; rather, it\nshould satisfy itself that the project is a priority in its strategic plans, and does not have unforeseen\nconsequences. Here the economic evaluation is essential.\n\nIt will be clear from the above that the economic and financial assessments will not give the\nsame  answers  (in  terms  of  their  NPV  or  IRR)  and  are  likely  to  be  in  conflict.  The  economic\nassessment  has  a  wider  focus  and  more  detailed  measurement  than  a  financial  assessment,\nwhich  is  narrow  and  crude  by  comparison.  Figure  4  highlights  the  principal  economic  benefits\nwhich are excluded from, or will be under-represented in, a financial appraisal; and it shows that\nnot all of the economic benefits are capable of being captured via tolls.\n\ni.\n\nImplications of Government Investment\n\nThe semi-private characteristics of expressways and the existence of economic benefits\nthat cannot be captured in toll revenues provides the rationale for public sector investment. It is,\ngiven the caveats above, right for government to want to invest in PSP expressways to secure\nthe  decongestion  benefits  for  non-users  of  the  expressway  (and  also  other  non-capturable\nbenefits).\n\nMany  expressways  should  therefore  be  implemented  under  reverse-tender  BOT\ncontracts: e.g., the private sector bids at defined tolls to minimize the government investment.\nThis is a most important conclusion, for it applies to most expressways (i.e., those that are not\nfinancially viable). Yet the case studies suggest that no government in Asia invites bids on this\nbasis. Instead, bids are invited in the expectation that projects will be profitable, and when they\nare not, then either government support is committed (often in the form of contingent guarantees\nthat do not become a liability for many years), or the project is delayed, or occasionally that it is\nabandoned.\n\n\fFigure 4:  Expressway Economic and Financial Characeristic\n\nEconomic Evaluation\nBENEFIT\n\nUser  Benefits\n\u2022 Time savings to all road network users valued:\n\nboth  expressway  users  (who  pay  tolls)  and  users\nof  the  existing  decongested  roads  (who  do  not)\n\nFinancial Evaluation\nREVENUES\n\n\u2022 Tolls  recovered  only  from  expressway  users\n\nIndividual estimate of time savings for each zone to zone movement\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Each fraction of a minute saved is valued\n\n\u2022 Toll collection systems unable to differentiate different zone to zone\n\nmovements,  except  coarsely,  using  distance  as  a  proxy\n\n\u2022 Separate values of time savings by vehicle type and trip pupose\n\n\u2022 Toll collection systems unable to extract different tolls by purpose\n\n\u2022 Values of time assumed to grow through time in line with GDP/head\n\n\u2022 Tolls often allowed to grow only in line with inflation\n\n\u2022 Vehicle operating cost saving fully estimated and valued\n\n\u2022 Can only be recovered coarsely through tolls\n\n\u2022 No mechanism for their recovery\n\n7\n2\n\nas  well  as  inflation\n\nExternal  Benefits\n\u2022 Environmental benefits\n\u2022 Accidental  benefits\n\nBenefit\n\nRevenue\n\nmaximum\nrevenue\n\nToll\n\nToll\n\nrevenue\nmaximising\ntolls\n\n\f   73\n\nj.\n\nImpact of the PSP Environment\n\nTraditionally, economic analysis was used to determine what should be implemented,\nand  that  was  the  end  of  economic  analysis:  implementation  was  assumed  to  be  a  neutral\nprocess. But the PSP environment has both highlighted that this is not the case, and focused\nattention on the huge importance of the implementation process in determining actual project\nimpacts.\n\nIt is not unusual for projects to be approved on the basis of one set of assumptions,\nonly to find that what happens is very different. In the case of PSP, this is critical. If the project\ntolls are very different from those assumed, if the roads accessing the expressway are not\nimproved or if the construction cost and time are optimistic, then the decisions of both government\nand concessionaire will have been wrong, and conflict between the parties will be the result.\n\nThe decision-point for PSP projects needs to be made later, and on the basis of far\nmore information than has traditionally been the case. Government should make its commitment\non the basis of a business case, and central to this should be optimization of the project \u2014\nconfirming that it meets both economic and financial appraisal criteria.\n\nThese  two  appraisals  should  be  seen  as  two-sides  of  the  same  coin.  For  example,\ngovernment should be presented with choices such as the following, in order to decide the\nbest trade-off between economic and financial performance:\n\nToll level\n\nEconomic IRR\n\nGovernment Contribution\nUS$ million\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n20%\n15%\n10%\n\n400\n300\n100\n\nIn this illustration, the medium toll level may be the most acceptable compromise - that is,\ngovernment would wish to invest an extra US$100 million, relative to the low-toll level, in order to secure\na much improved economic performance.\n\n3.\n\nCompetition and Regulation\n\nThere is evidence that corruption and nepotism occur where this is absent, resulting in services\n\nwhich may not satisfy government objectives.\n\nToll roads are normally introduced into an existing free road network. Existing free roads will\ncarry traffic to and from the toll road and may compete with it. In some countries it is a statutory\nrequirement that there has to be a free road available as an alternative to a tolled road. There may\nbe strong modal alternatives to tolled roads: rail for passenger or freight movements, air for passenger\nmovements, and shipping for freight movements.\n\na.\n\nEnsuring a Competitive Market\n\nA competitive environment is necessary to ensure that appropriate investment and pricing\npolicies  are  followed  and  that  services  are  provided  efficiently  and  are  responsive  to\nmarket  demand.  Competition  can  be  provided  for  a  market,  and  within  a  market.\n\n\f74\n\nCompetition for the market - retaining public regulation of the right to supply transport is desirable\n\nin circumstances when:\n\n\u2022 Duplication of services is wasteful or impractical, indicating a natural monopoly.\n\n\u2022 A lack of regulation leads to the duplication of schedules, potential excess capacity, pressure\n\nto engage in dangerous practices, or a loss in the stability or reliability of services.\n\n\u2022 Social objectives require direct financing or support to be provided. Competitive bidding\n\nis then required to ensure that services are provided at the lowest support.\n\nCompetition for the market for transport infrastructure is primarily achieved through the\ncompetitive award of long-term concessions. This competitive process introduces market forces\ninto the provision and management of infrastructure with the objective of stimulating efficiency by\ntransferring risk to the private sector.\n\nCompetition in a market, free from barriers to entry, is appropriate when the market size\nis large relative to the efficient scale of operation of services within the market. A number of\noperators can then provide efficient services in competition with one another. Alternatively, if the\nefficient scale of operation is large relative to market size, competition in the market may still be\nachieved if there is strong competition between modes or, for international movements, if there\nis strong international competition.\n\nThe  characteristics  of  expressways  therefore  require  both  competition for, and in, the\n\nmarket.\n\nb.\n\nRequirements for Regulation in the Market\n\nThere  is  a  need  for  the  independent  regulation  of  the  activities  of  transport  sector\nproviders and operators, including the government, if PSP is to be encouraged. Regulation\nhas to create a level playing field. The principal requirements for regulation in the context of\nexpressways  are:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe Provision of Alternative Routes. For some transport services, a regulatory environment\nthat permits the free entry of competing operators is required. For expressways, for which\ndemand  is  normally  unlikely  to  be  sufficient  to  support  competing  routes,  a  regulatory\nframework which restricts the government provision of, or government support for alternative\nroutes is likely to be required. Concessionaires and their lenders will want to be assured that\ngovernment will not promote competing routes and that compensation will be payable in\nrespect  of  government  policies  that  discriminate  against  private  concessions.  Had  this\nprovision existed, the combined expressway/rail Hopewell project in Thailand may not have\nfailed.\n\nTariffs.  Allowing  a  monopoly  expressway  operator  to  specify  tolls  will  result  in  a\nmonopoly profit that maximizes the price charged to the user. A regulatory framework\nthat controls toll levels, toll structures, and mechanisms for increasing tolls through\ntime is required.\n\nTechnical Standards. Government will wish to control the standards to which roads\nare designed and constructed, to ensure they comply with safety requirements, the\nrequirements for transport services, and that they can be integrated effectively with\n\n\f75\n\nother  expressways  and  roads.  For  example,  if  government  determines  that  buses\nshould  use  expressways  at  low  tariffs  -  to  assist  low-income  travelers,  then  the\nexpressway has to be designed for bus stopping-places, and convenient access at\njunctions.\n\n\u2022 Profits. In order to prevent monopoly profits, the regulatory framework might specify\nmaximum  profits,  but  at  the  risk  of  stifling  the  entrepreneurial  activity  of  a\nconcessionaire. However, if as usual, the public sector is involved in funding a project\njointly with the private sector, then a profit-sharing mechanism would need to be agreed.\nThis paradoxically helps both parties - because it is embarrassing for government\nwhen projects are known to be too profitable: Was the contract let fairly? Why was\nthis not foreseen? etc.\n\n4.\n\nCosts, Tariffs, and Integration\n\na.\n\nCosts\n\nThe costs of constructing expressways have been reviewed on the basis of the case study and\nother evidence, from Asia and elsewhere. They are (with the exception of PRC, as previously noted)\nhigh, and typically as follows:\n\n  Expressway                                 Cost per kilometer\n\n                                           USS million\n\nUrban\nInter-urban\n\nRange\n15-50\n3-10\n\nTypical\n25\n5\n\nThus a 15-kilometer expressway will typically cost US$400 million if urban, and US$75\n\nmillion if inter-urban.\n\nOperating costs comprise: operation of tolling stations, traffic management, facilities\nmanagement,  maybe  policing,  routine  maintenance  and  resurfacing/rehabilitation/\nreconstruction  as  necessary.  These  costs  are,  relative  to  the  initial  costs,  not  high.  They\nmay amount to 15 percent of the annual gross revenues.\n\nb.\n\nTariffs\n\nEconomic efficiency requires beneficiaries to meet the marginal economic costs of the\n\nservice, where marginal includes the capital cost of new roads. This would lead to:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTariffs by vehicle type, depending on their contribution to pavement deterioration\nand congestion (if traffic levels approached the expressway capacity, tolls would\nincrease).\n\nTariffs  targeting  the  poor,  and  adjusted  for  pollution  -  if  these  are  important\ngovernment objective. This could translate to low tariffs for buses (assuming first that\nthe bus market is competitive).\n\n\f76\n\nConcessionaires attempt to base tariffs on: the financing imperatives  \u2013 of early payback,\ngiven the willingness-to-pay of users. One might think that they would be motivated to maximize\ntraffic (and thereby also serve economic objectives), but this is not always so. Rather, they seek to\nmaximize net revenue, which can mean excluding trucks by design, and certainly targeting the higher-\nincome users.\n\nThe normal practice in determining expressway tariffs is as follows:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe preferred bidder will play the key role in setting tolls at levels he believes to be revenue-\nmaximizing, i.e., in pursuit of financial objectives.\n\nTolls tend to follow international experience with a toll rate for cars of US$0.05 \u2014\nUS$0.1 per km and higher tolls for trucks.\n\nThe largest trucks with 4+ axles and buses, tend to pay a toll of three to four times the\ncar toll.\n\nTolls  are  set  at  revenue-maximizing  levels  from  the  outset,  causing  lower  value,\nnonbusiness trips to use parallel non-tolled routes and very often pricing trucks off the\nexpressway also.\n\nThere is usually an inflation-based escalation clause, but real increases in tolls (e.g.,\nin excess of the rate of inflation) are often not permitted.\n\nTolls,  which  are  central  to  delivering  government\u2019s  policy  objectives,  are  rarely\nconsidered by governments as a policy tool \u2013 instead, they are defined by bidders against a\ngovernment  requirement  to  minimize  the  tolls.  It  is  not  clear  that  this  best  achieves\ngovernment\u2019s objectives, for example:\n\nTolls  that  are  too  high  lead  to  under-use  of  the  expressway,  contrary  to  transport\nobjectives. This is a common occurrence.\n\nTolls that are too low (and cannot be increased) lead to congested expressways, which\ndefeat their original purpose.\n\nTolls that are too high for trucks result in them avoiding the expressway, instead continuing\ntravel through towns etc.\n\nLow  tolls  for  buses  can  result  in  huge  benefits  for  low-income  travelers  \u2013  usually  a\ngovernment objective, but only implemented in Malaysia, to our knowledge.\n\nTolls do not vary by time of day/week, yet congestion on many inter-urban expressways\nusually does. Maybe higher tolls at congested times would be desirable.\n\nThis private sector-led, ad hoc practice may not suit anybody\u2019s best interest.\n\n\f77\n\nc.\n\nIntegration  Requirements\n\nThere are several forms of integration. They can hugely affect expressway traffic and\ntherefore benefits and revenues. All require government to define its policy - but few governments\n(yet) do this effectively:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe expressway must be physically integrated with the existing corridor and area.\nJunctions must be located (or be capable of location) at the right places \u2014 to serve\npresent and future requirements - i.e., government must specify its requirements, the\nconcessionaire will be concerned mainly in the short-term.\n\n\u2022 Expressways  must  be  linked  effectively  with  the  existing  road  network,  allowing\nconvenient access and regress. Often this requires road improvements and traffic\nmanagement outside the expressway site, something government must implement.\nIncreasingly,  it  should  involve  integrated  transport  control  with  the  existing  road\nsystem. If special facilities are required for buses, these need to be designed from\nthe outset.\n\n\u2022 Expressways must themselves be physically linked.\n\nThe tolling technology of different expressways should at least be compatible. This would\nallow each to charge different tariffs, but be more attractive to the driver \u2014 with less stopping\nand queuing to pay (this is already a problem in the Klang Valley in Malaysia); and desirably\neasier payment through the introduction of electronic tolling.\n\n\u2022 Possibly,  the  tariffs  of  different  expressways  could  be  integrated  into  a  common  tariff\nsystem.  This  requires  a  central  revenue  collection  and  allocation  mechanism  and  is\nobviously not easy to implement - but it will become much easier when electronic\ntolling becomes widespread. The benefit would be substantial \u2014 increased traffic on\nthe  system  as  a  whole,  as  routes  are  not  distorted  by  different  tariffs  for  each\nexpressway.\n\n5.\n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts\n\nThere  is  current  concern  in  ADB  and  elsewhere  about  the  impact  of  private  sector-led\ntransport infrastructure on social equity and the environment. On the one hand, has it harmed\nthese core objectives, and on the other, have opportunities to promote the social and environmental\nagenda been missed?\n\n\u2022\n\nLand acquisition and relocation \u2013 the evidence here is reassuring: due processes for\nsecuring  land,  and  relocating  and  compensating  affected  families  have  generally  been\nrespected.\n\n\u2022 Serving development objectives - in some cases38 the objectives of the road are\nnot well defined. Are inter-urban roads or roads near the urban periphery required to\n\n38 ADB is currently addressing this issue in PRC in the context of the substantial lending programme for expressways.\n\n\f78\n\nbring land into efficient development, or to serve longer-distance \u2018through\u2019 traffic? If\nthis question is left to the concessionaire, he will focus on the existing major traffic\ngenerators and attractors. The issue reverts to the need for government to identify\nsuch  major  projects,  including  the  location  of  interchanges,  and  the  access\ninfrastructure.\n\n\u2022 Policy for lower-income \u2013 Malaysia has demonstrated that by the simple expedient\nof keeping bus tariffs low, and designing separate facilities for motor-cycles, lower\nincome passengers benefit, without major detriment to project finances. They would\nbenefit  more  if  the  accesses  at  interchanges  were  designed  with  bus  access  and\nstopping in mind. This requires government to set policy. With this isolated exception,\nwe are unaware of any such policies being applied anywhere.\n\n\u2022 Visual impact and severance - the BOT policy as implemented in many big cities is\ncreating an elevated spaghetti of structures. The visual impact does not appear to\ncause the concern that it would in, say, Europe. Severance is clearly often a major\nproblem which is rarely addressed.\n\nThe  conclusion,  based  upon  the  evidence,  is  that  the  concern  about  social  and\nenvironmental  impacts  is  opposite.  Much  could  be  done  to  align  such  projects  better  with\ngovernment\u2019s stated objectives.\n\n6.\n\nEnsuring value for money\n\nGovernments  need  to  ensure  they  are  getting  value  for  money  from  expressways,\nwhether or not the public sector contributes to their funding. In practice, the public sector is likely\nto have to make a substantial contribution. Governments also need to be sure that any public\nsector contribution is a priority use of scarce public funds. Establishing performance against this\ncriterion is necessary both as part of the normal audit role of government, and to inform future\npolicy in the light of experience.\n\nGovernments therefore need to:\n\n\u2022\n\nIdentify, structure and procure PSP projects, using best-practice guidelines such as those\nestablished in this technical assistance.\n\n\u2022 Make use of public sector comparators (a database of expressway unit costs would be\na valuable input to this process) to ensure that the bidders\u2019 cost estimates represent a\ngain over having the project commissioned as a public sector project.\n\n\u2022 Establish  the  economic  value-for-money  of  expressways  -  through  before-and-after\n\nstudies.\n\nD.\n\nIdentification\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIdentification is the process which allows government to:\n\n\u2022 Determine strategy.\n\u2022\n\nIdentify projects for priority implementation.\n\n\f79\n\n\u2022 Determine the role for the private sector.\n\n\u2022 Specify key features of the project that affect its priority in the roads program.\n\nTo be meaningful, the results of these activities must be accepted widely. The process of carrying\nthem out must have the right institutional setting if they are to achieve this essential support. It is for\nexample, not unusual for major transport studies undertaken by one ministry to be ignored by others,\nwhose support is necessary for implementation.\n\nIdentification must:\n\n\u2022 Determine the overall transport strategy in the context of government\u2019s development strategy/\nplan. This comprises transport policies, investment in projects, and institutional components.\nFor cities, and for some other corridors/areas the strategy will be multi-modal, defining the\nrole of road sector improvements in overall strategy.\n\n\u2022 Determine  the  core  projects  of  the  roads  sector,  which  could  be  implemented  as  PSP\nprojects. Guard against other projects - which may conflict with the transport strategy.\n\n\u2022\n\nFor these priority PSP projects, prepare feasibility studies, with a focus on economic viability,\nimplementability and fundability. Government must confirm that permissions can be obtained,\nthat necessary land can be acquired, and people relocated. The project vertical alignment (if\nrelevant) must be acceptable on environmental grounds.\n\n\u2022 Define  how  the  project  is  to  be  integrated  into  the  transport  system:  defining  the\nlocation/nature of physical interchanges, and the required impact on the capacity of\nthe existing road.\n\n\u2022 Define  the  tariffs,  which  must  be  socially  acceptable.  These  materially  affect  economic\n\nviability, and must be considered at this identification stage.\n\n\u2022 Define special requirements - for example access for buses (hence for low-income travelers\n\n- these impose special design requirements) and their tariffs.\n\n\u2022 Determine the broad risks and scale of government support (investment and guarantees)\n\nthat will be necessary.\n\n2.\n\nThe Importance of Identification\n\nIdentification is particularly important in the land transport sector. Not all projects are\ngood \u2014 an expressway in the wrong location can cause enormous problems \u2013 hence, identifying\nthe right project is important:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFor  example  in  a  big  city,  it  is  conventional  for  mass  transit  to  be  improved  down\nradial roads to the city center, with expressways serving circumferential movements,\nwhich are less easily catered for by public transport. But if expressways are instead\nbuilt to/through city centers, the strategy is fundamentally undermined, and th\u2019ere is\nno prospect of controlling traffic congestion \u2014 Bangkok suffers from this problem.\n\nIf  too  many  expressways  are  built,  the  strategy  is  similarly  undermined.  Again  in\nBangkok this occurs: in the northern corridor, the Second-Stage Expressway System,\nthe Don Muang Tollway and Hopewell have been developed by different sponsoring\n\n\f80\n\nagencies \u2018in competition\u2019. Second Stage Expressway System was opened first and\nis successful; the Don Muang Tollway was second and has had huge problems -\nGovernment  now  owns  part  of  the  equity;  while  the  Hopewell  project  which  was\nthird has been abandoned while part-completed.\n\nMajor  road  projects  must  be  integrated  in  the  network.  This  requires  positive  action\nboth in the corridor and adjacent to it. If expressway junctions are not in the right place, or\ninterchange designs are poor, or the design/construction has not been well-devised, or provision\nhas not been made for buses, or local road improvements necessary to provide access to the\nexpressway have not been made - then:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTraffic and revenues on the expressway will be tower than they should be.\nLand in the expressway corridor will not be developed efficiently.\nTraffic congestion on the existing road will remain (particularly if its capacity has been\nreduced by expressway construction).\nLower income bus travelers may not benefit.\n\nIf a network of expressways Is being developed through projects implemented by competing\nconcessionaires,  integration  becomes  particularly  challenging.  Physical  interchange  must  be\npossible, toll equipment integration is desirable, and tariff integration may become possible. When\nsuch integration is made to happen, the network becomes more attractive to use (with less stopping/\nqueuing  to  pay,  and  easier  payment  mechanisms),  and  traffic  increases,  in  turn,  leading  to\ndecongestion on the existing roads.\n\nExperience.is that integration does not happen when there are several concessionaires,\nwho  perceive  each  other  as  competitors.  Government  therefore  needs  to  define  integration\nrequirements, and impose these on private concessionaires.\n\n3.\n\nFrom Public to Private Sector Process\n\nThe typical public sector identification process of the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s may be characterized\nas planning-led and often based upon what in insight has been an optimistic future scenario. To\nsome  extent,  this  approach  continues  today.  It  typically  assumed  that  once  the  project(s)  was\nidentified, its implementation was a neutral process.\n\nIt typically featured, in turn, the development of the following, with decisions taken at the end\n\nof each stage:\n\n\u2022 A development strategy \u2014 the context for.\n\u2022 A transport (or roads) strategy - which allowed priority projects to be identified.\n\u2022 A feasibility study of a priority expressway \u2014 this allowed government to commit to\n\nimplementation.\n\nThe requirements of the planning process in the era of PSP are both unchanged, and\nyet very different. What is unchanged is the requirement that there must be a clear framework\nof  objectives  from  which  to  determine  strategy  and  identify  projects,  and  the  importance  of\neconomics and cost-effectiveness in determining what should be done. While PSP changes\nthe impact of expressways, the resulting project is still required to be economically (as opposed\nto financially) viable.\n\n\f81\n\nThe main differences are an emphasis on:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nImplementability and fundability - the public sector approach presumes that these issues\ncan  be  overcome,  once  a  good  project  is  identified.  The  private  sector  approach\nrecognizes the reality that these are absolutely critical - because implementation and\nfunding of land transport projects are both very difficult.\n\n\u2022 Acceptability - of tariffs, and of environmental impacts (particularly for elevated structures).\n\nThe absence of these will prevent implementation.\n\nThe implementation process. The presumption that, once identified, this is neutral is\npatently wrong. What happens during implementation has a profound effect upon the\nproject impacts - hence on the costs and benefits of the project.\n\n\u2022 Risk  and  upon  developing  a  robust,  rather  than  optimal  project.  The  project\nenvironment clearly requires this, yet it is rarely addressed adequately by the public\nsector.\n\nInnovation  in  both  process  and  projects.  In  process,  to  fast-track  the  project\ndevelopment cycle (which, particularly when development banks are involved, can be\nvery long), and in projects, recognizing that the public sector does not hold a monopoly\non good ideas.\n\nThese changes are unambiguously necessary. The sole issue in the new era of PSP is\nhow best to make the change. Specifically, what are \u2014 or should be \u2014 the bounds of the public and\nprivate sectors?\n\n4.\n\nRoles for the Public and Private Sectors\n\nPrevious sections of this report have reviewed the evidence. The firm conclusion is that\nwhile the private sector has often thought it could identify and implement expressways, this has\nonly exceptionally proved possible. Even in UK this was thought possible, but it has failed.39 And,\neven if this were possible, we have noted that not all projects are \u2018good\u2019.\n\nThe unambiguous conclusion is that government must set policy and determine strategy.\n\nThe issue then is how this is done - and how the undoubted benefits of PSP can be realized.\n\nThere is no monopoly of knowledge here, instead much experimentation, and lessons are\n\nbeing learned.\n\n39\n\nOriginal proposals for the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, one of the first BOT proposals in UK, left the private sector to define\nthe precise alignment, in the expectation that land holdings and associated development might determine alignment and thereby\ncontribute to financing. The result is that government has had to define the detailed alignment, and now (10 years later) this is still\nbeing opposed and is awaiting permissions.\n\n\f82\n\nE.\n\nPSP  Modalities\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nexpressways, as follows:\n\nThere  are  several  tasks  to  be  undertaken  in  the  planning  and  construction  of\n\n\u2022 Planning.\n\u2022 Design.\nFinance.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nLand acquisition/relocation.\n\u2022 Construction.\n\u2022 Operation  (primarily  tolling,  but  including  management  of  the  road-checking  vehicle\n\nweights, cleaning the carriageway, maintaining lighting fixtures, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Maintenance.\n\nIn a pure public sector project, all functions are undertaken by the public sector. However,\nin most countries, there has already been some evolution away from force account construction,\nand construction is undertaken by a private construction firm, under contract. Typically, the\ncontract is determined by the detailed (public) design and does not allow for variations except\nunder change orders. This process requires significant levels of supervision from government\nand  often  sees  substantial  price  rises  during  the  course  of  the  contract  as  a  result  of  the\nchange orders.\n\nPrivate sector involvement has at least one of the objectives:\n\n\u2022 Reduction in immediate cost to the public sector (through use of innovative construction\n\nor design techniques, tighter cost control, or risk allocation).\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nImproved revenue collection, through improvement in revenue collection and through\nreducing the extent of revenue leakage.\n\nTransfer of some risk to the private sector (under the traditional construction contract,\nchange orders leave much of the risk with the public sector and there is typically no\npenalty for late completion of work).\n\n\u2022 Reduction in public sector maintenance responsibility.\n\n\u2022 Development of private sector skills (in maintenance management, in design, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Understanding and unbundling of requirements and priorities so that each requirement\nis explicitly acknowledged rather than being wrapped up (bundled) into a single all-\nencompassing contract, which is the normal practice under public sector provision.\n\nIt is important to note that the objective(s) are not always achieved in practice, whether as\na result of poor concession design, an overriding desire to involve the private sector in provision of\npublic services, or simply because of weak government.\n\nSome  functions  will  nearly  always  remain  in  the  public  arena.  For  expressways  this\nprobably only includes land acquisition and relocation. Ensuring that the practices undertaken\n\n\f83\n\nmeet  the  appropriate  social  and  environmental  guidelines  is  important  and  could  be  difficult  to\nmonitor. The risks involved are very high and include time delays and cost escalation, as well as\nconsiderable political/public opinion risk. Since the risks are so high, transferring this role to the\nprivate sector would be costly.\n\n2. Options for PSP\n\nTable  17  presents  the  generic  options  for  PSP,  and  illustrates  the  continuum  in  PSP\nexperience that they represent. It should be noted that intermediate contract forms can be devised\nwhich include elements of more than one option.\n\nReading from the left, the forms of contract presented offer:\n\n\u2022 An increasing transfer of risk and financial responsibility to the private sector.\n\n\u2022 An increasingly large public policy commitment from government, since the contracts\n\ntend to be in place for longer periods of time.\n\nKey features of this table are:\n\n\u2022 Not all of the risks specified are always transferred to the private sector - this is decided\n\non a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  contracts  are  performance  driven.  In  traditional  government  construction\ncontracts, the full details of procedures and quantities to be used are specified. In\nthese  contracts,  by  contrast,  the  inputs  are  not  specified,  rather  the  government\ndetermines the level of service which it requires (e.g., the road capacity and ride\nquality) and allows the private contractor to determine how it can most effectively\nprovide those requirements. This leaves government with the role of ensuring that\nthe services provided are as specified, and making payments or charging penalties\nas agreed in advance.\n\n\fForm of Contract\n\nTurnkey\n\nOperate & Maintain\n\nCorridor Management\n\nRehabilitate-Operate-\nTransfer (ROT)\n\nBOT\n\nDefinition\n\nDesign  &  Build\nFixed Fee from\n\nMaintain and Operate\n\nFinance,  Rehabilitate,\nMaintain and Operate\n\nMaintenance\nManagement\n\nMaintain\nFree from\n\nTable 17:   Characteristics of the PSP Options\n\nExamples\n- see case studies\n\nNew  South  Wales US\nUS\n\nHong  Kong,  China\n\nArgentina\nHong  Kong,  China\n\nArgentina\nColombia\n\nFinance,  Design,  Construct,\nMaintain & Operate\nCorridor/Network\n\nFinance,  Design,  Construct,\nMaintain & Operate a\n\nMalaysia;  Philippines;\nThailand,  Hong  Kong,  China Colombia\nArgentina, US, etc.\n\nUK (DBFO)\n\nCost Recovery\n\nNo income \u2014 fixed No income - fixed\ngovernment\npayment\n\ngovernment  payment\n\nTypically government\nreceives  some  toll\nrevenue\n\nConcessionaire  may  pay Substantial  government\nGovernment or vice-versa investment  usually  required\n\nGovernment  contributes\nexisting  roads,  and  other\ninvestment  usually  required\n\nMedium\n\nLarge/ Very Large\n\nMedium/Large\n\nScale of Private\nInvestment\n\nVery low\n\nConsiderable for very Low\nshort  term\n\nPrivate Sector Risks Maintenance\n\nDesign\nConstruction\n\nTraffic & revenue levels Rehabilitation\nRevenue  collection\nPolitical\nFinancial\nMaintenance\n\nTraffic & revenue levels\nRevenue  collection\nPolitical\nFinancial\nMaintenance\n\nRevenue  received\nSocial\n\nForce  majeure\nSocial\n\nDesign\nConstruction\nTraffic & revenue levels\nRevenue  collection\nPolitical\nFinancial\nMaintenance\n\nPlanning\nForce Majeure\nMacro\nSocial/  environmental\n\nDesign\nConstruction\nTraffic & revenue levels\nRevenue  Collection\nPolitical\nFinancial\nMaintenance\n\n8\n4\n\nPlanning\nForce Majeure\nMacro\nSocial/  environmental\n\nSmall/Medium\n\nMedium/Large\n\nVery Large\nc.  $l00m  -$1  billion\n\nMedium/Large\nc. $90- $300 m\n\nForce  majeure\nPlanning\nTraffic levels\nMaintenance\n\nMedium/Large\n$50 - $800 m\n\nSmall/local\nconstruction  firm\n\nMedium/large\nconstruction  firm\n\nConstruction  firm  with\nmanagement  skills\n\nLarger  construction  firm\nwith  management  skills\n\nConsortium  including  major Consortium  incl.:  a\nconstruction  firms\n\nconstruction  firm\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nMedium\n\nHigh\n\nHigh\n\nPublic Sector Risks\n(land acquisition and\nrelocation risks are\nalways carried)\n\nTypical Contract size\n(US$ million)\n\nSmall\n\nMinimum size\nconcessionaire\nrequired\n\nExtent of Government\npreparation/super\nvision required\n\nTypical Duration\n\n2-10  years\n\nDefined  construction\n\n10-20  years\n\n25-30  years\n\n25-30  years\n\n2-10  years\nperiod  only\n\n\fFigure 5:         Characteristics of the PSP Options\n\nRANGE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION OPTIONS\n\nA\nMaintainance\nManagement\n\nB\n\nTurn key\n\nC\n\nD\n\nOperate\nand Maintain\n\nE\n\nROT\n\nBOT\n\nF\n\nCorridor\nManagement\n\n8\n5\n\nSIMPLE\n\nCOMPLEX\n\nMakes  Investment  from  the  Private  Sector  over  a  longer  period\n\nConsideration  of  Life  Costs  more  likely\n\nMore  Government  Preparation  and  Supervision  Required\n\nMore  Risk  Transfer  possible:  more  effective  PSP\n\n\f86\n\nThe most limited contracts, in terms of risk transfer, are those which employ the private\n\nsector for only one or two of the tasks. Typically this has been through a package of either:\n\nMaintenance management. Management of maintenance here refers to the business\nof deciding what maintenance is required and when, in order to achieve the desired level of\nservice on the road for the duration of the contract. The work may be carried out by the winner\nof the contract, or he may sub-contract elements to other parties, while being responsible to\ngovernment for performance delivery. These are typically short-term contracts since there is\nno need for large investments on the part of the contractor. The government makes a defined\nstream of payments to the concessionaire in return for its\u2019 achieving the pavement and other\nstandards defined in the agreement. If the standards are not achieved, then government will\nimplement an agreed penalty schedule. Such contracts are in use in UK, New South Wales,\nAustralia, and US.\n\nDesign  and  construction  (turnkey  contracts).  These  contracts  require  design  and\nconstruction of a new facility (for which the alignment and basic construction parameters are\ndefined) to an agreed price and timetable. Should the timetable slip, the government may levy\npenalties as agreed, and sometimes, early completion leads to the payment of a success fee.\nThese contracts are often referred to as turnkey contracts, because the public sector is supplied\nwith a facility that is ready for use and they simply need to \u201cturn the key\u201d. Turnkey contracts\nhave been used extensively in the US.\n\nIn both of the above cases, the contracts are performance based and there can be significant\npenalties for under performance on the part of the contractor. These two options are also particularly\napplicable where government does not wish to allow tolls to be levied; instead it pays the private\nsector on a fixed-fee lump sum basis.\n\nPackaging elements together reduces the private sector risk, since they have direct control\n\nover important interfaces. This reduces the cost to the public sector.\n\nFull performance based, operate and maintain contracts are the next in the hierarchy\nof private sector involvement. Some parts of the network are maintained under this type of\ncontract in Argentina. The contracts involve specified maintenance standards and collection of\ntolls from traffic at agreed toll rates. The toll revenues will typically be collected and retained by\nthe contractor.\n\nThese revenues may be sufficient to cover toll collection and maintenance costs and the\ncontractors profit, and result in a payment to government. The revenue threshold above which\npayment will be made to government is usually defined in the concession agreement.\n\nThe three options so far described can be particularly applicable where:\n\n\u2022 Capital markets are not well developed (and therefore there is no access to long term\n\ndebt - so that the private sector could not take on a full BOT style contract).\n\n\u2022\n\nThe government is concerned about private capacity to undertake more comprehensive\ncontracts and/or its capacity to administer them.\n\n\f87\n\nIn some cases, where the road network is of particularly poor quality, resulting from many\nyears of under-funded or ineffective maintenance, rehabilitation is added to the operate and maintain\ncontracts. These are known as ROT contracts.\n\nThese require larger scale investments from the concessionaire. The standard of road\nsurface required is defined in the concession agreement and must usually be achieved within\na defined period of the contract commencing; before this time, tolls cannot be levied. The toll\nlevels are defined in the agreement (with escalation rates) and this revenue is used to finance\nthe rehabilitation, maintenance and operation. Depending on the degree of rehabilitation work\nrequired,  and  the  traffic  revenues,  some  government  financial  assistance  may  also  be\nnecessary. In this case, contracts can be designed to allow governments to share in the upside\npotential as well.\n\nROT  contracts  are  of  slightly  longer  duration  than  the  simple  maintain  and  operate\narrangement, because of the need to re-coup the higher costs of rehabilitation. Such contracts\nhave  been  used  widely  in  Argentina.  Their  basic  advantage  is  that  good  rehabilitation  is\nnecessary to minimize future maintenance to which the concessionaire is also committed (he\naims to minimize his total cost).\n\nNext  in  the  hierarchy  of  transferring  responsibility  are  the  BOT  style  contracts. These\ncover design, finance, construction, operation, and maintenance. This has been the preferred option\nin Asia. These are very large projects in which the government and private sector agree the principles\nfor construction, maintenance, and management of a new facility which is then provided by the\nconcessionaire. Tolls are charged in order to finance the construction and where necessary (given\nthe traffic, revenue, and construction costs) these are supplemented by government. Again, the\ngovernment may share in the upside potential of the project. At the end of the long concession\nperiod, the road usually reverts to the government at no cost.\n\nThe final contract form is corridor management. This represents a combination of the\noperate and maintain (or ROT) and BOT contracts. The private sector takes responsibility for a\nroad corridor or a defined part of the road network. He is required to operate and maintain these\nexisting facilities and expand capacity as defined by government (widening or constructing new\nlinks).\n\nThis approach allows government to pass responsibility for the management and capacity\nexpansion of whole corridors or areas of the road network to the private sector. The contractor may\nbe given incentive payments on achieving performance standards (e.g., a reduction of accidents,\nor minimizing lane closures as in the UK DBFO); and be required to pay penalties where agreed\nperformance is not achieved.\n\nThese latter contract forms allow government to transfer many risks to the private sector,\nwhile gaining a road which it has planned for the national network. However in practice, the extent\nof risk transfer will depend on:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe relative strength at negotiation of the concessionaire and government.\nThe confidence with which toll revenues and construction costs can be predicted.\n\n\f88\n\n3.\n\nOwnership\n\noptions for the infrastructure:\n\nUnder  the  BOT  and  corridor  management  forms,  there  are  two  principal  ownership\n\n\u2022 Ownership  can  be  transferred  on  completion  of  construction  to  the  public  sector  \u2014\n\nunder a sale and lease back arrangement.\n\n\u2022 Ownership can remain with the private sector for the duration of the concession and\n\nthen be transferred to the public sector (with or without a payment).\n\nUnder the first of these options (a Build-Lease-Transfer arrangement), the public sector\nwill operate the infrastructure for the duration of the concession, making lease payments to the\nprivate sector construction company. This is an evolution from the simple turnkey structure by\nwhich the government makes use of private sector financing for construction. The concept can\nbe supplemented by a maintenance and operation contract awarded by the government, under\nthe  terms  of  which  the  lease  payment  obligations  are  transferred  to  the  operations  and\nmaintenance contractor.\n\nThe  optimum  ownership  solution  for  each  situation  depends  on  local  circumstances,\n\nincluding:\n\nLocal taxation arrangements.\n\n\u2022 Structure of the concession company.\n\u2022\n\u2022 Profitability of the expressway (and hence tax liability).\n\u2022 Duration of the concession.\n\n4.\n\nPlanning\n\nThe most comprehensive transfer of risk and financial responsibility can be achieved\nwhen  the  private  sector  also  undertakes  the  planning  of  the  project.  These  are  known  as\nunsolicited  bids  to  governments  and  are  relatively  common  in  some  Asian  countries.  Their\nadvantages are that the private sector can be expected to carry all traffic risks (since it has\nadvocated a project). Their disadvantages lie in:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTheir  questionable  cost  effectiveness  if,  as  often  happens  in  practice,  they  are  not\neffectively integrated into the existing road network.\n\nThe additional costs that the government may carry in providing supporting infrastructure\n(access  roads,  etc.).\n\nThe disruption to the network which has been planned by government, of which the\nproposed project may not be part. These network effects can be significant.\n\nThe  Don  Muang  expressway  in  Thailand  represents  a  clear  example  of  failure  to\nacknowledge these difficulties. In the concession agreement, the Government undertook to remove\nflyovers on the parallel existing road (reconstructing them to carry cross-traffic). However, this\ndid not happen and there was a delay of over two years, leading to significant under-use of the\nexpressway. This was a principal cause of the near bankruptcy of the concession company and\nthe need for a large cash injection from Government.\n\n\f89\n\nF.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework\n\n1.\n\nLegal\n\nPSP in the provision of public services has been limited until the last decade or so. This\nmeans that often the legal arrangements of a country have not yet been adapted to the requirements\nof private sector provision. In their absence \u2014 or the absence of their implementation, corruption\nhas sometimes emerged to undermine the benefits of PSP.\n\na.\n\nWhy should Government be concerned with the Legal Environment?\n\nGovernments  must  seek  to  ensure  that  the  objectives  they  have  determined  for  the\nconcession  are  achieved.  This  can  only  be  done  if  the  legal  framework  allows  it.  Without  an\nappropriate legal code in place, governments may find themselves challenged in the courts and\nthe process halted; there are several recent examples of this. Also, governments wish to ensure\nthat competition is maximized \u2014 to reduce the price of the contract; and that can only be done by\nensuring that potential bidders are not dissuaded because of the fear of inequitable treatment\nunder the law.\n\nGovernment needs to ensure that under the law:\n\n\u2022 Concessions are permitted (i.e., that government can transfer the right of construction\n\nand maintenance to a private party).\n\n\u2022\n\nTolling for use of public facilities, and tolling by the private sector, is permitted.\n\n\u2022 Exclusivity (where granted) is permitted.\n\n\u2022 Responsibilities are clearly divided between departments and levels of government\n(local, regional, or national), and that these different roles are co-ordinated, so that\napprovals are given effectively.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  legal  framework  in  all  areas  -  such  as  contract,  land,  or  financial  law  (e.g.,\ncurrency convertibility and profit repatriation arrangements) - allows national and\ninternational  companies  to  compete  on  an  equitable  basis.  Labor  and  tax  and\nimmigration laws are all important.\n\nb.\n\nWhy  should  a  Potential  Bidder  be  concerned  with  the  Legal\nEnvironment?\n\nBidding for BOT projects is costly \u2014 US$5 million is not unusual for a winning bidder in\nan efficient environment, and more where the BOT process is not well-developed. A stable policy\nand legal environment reduces these costs (which at the end of the day are usually borne by\ngovernment through the bontract price) and encourages keen competition.\n\nSince concessions typically include fixed delivery dates, concessionaires need to ensure\nthat  they  can  meet  those  dates.  If  permits  or  approvals  are  held  up  in  government,  because\nresponsibilities are not clear, they may default on the contract despite their best efforts. Similarly,\na court challenge to the legality of their contract, even if eventually overcome, poses financial\ncash flow difficulties for the concessionaire.\n\n\f90\n\nConcessionaires  are  seeking  to  earn  a  return  on  their  investment.  They  need  to  be\nreassured that they will be able to earn such a return and that they will then be able to repatriate\nthe profits if appropriate.\n\nDifferent private sector players will require different levels of assurance (depending in\nlarge part on their country of origin). However, their basic requirements will include reassurance\nthat:\n\nThe appropriate processes are in place to ensure that permits and approvals can be\nsecured when needed and that government can meet its obligations.\n\nTheir corporate structure is permitted Under the existing law.\n\n\u2022 Currency is convertible and profits can be repatriated.\n\n\u2022 Employment  (including  immigration),  environmental,  and  safety  laws  are  clear  and\n\nreasonable.\n\nLand law is compatible with the concession arrangements.\n\n\u2022 Accounting laws are known so that they can forecast the project financial return reliably.\n\nThe dispute resolution mechanisms are clear and provide reassurance.\n\nc.\n\nGeneral Concessioning Law or Sector Specific Legislation?\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nOnce governments have determined that they will change laws to achieve a satisfactory\nconcessioning environment, they may opt to make these changes globally, through a general\nconcessioning law which specifies the basic framework for PSP, or act at sector level. Regional\nauthorities also sometimes have significant power in the management of the concession process.\nMany of these comments apply equally at the regional and national level. With regional treatment\nof policy however, additional factors come into play, such as the treatment of national debts/\ncommitments, inter-regional requirements, and sharing of experience.\n\nSector level treatment will always be required because of the different nature of the\ncosts, the demand for the service, and the policy environment. Most countries select a hybrid\ntreatment which combines a sector specific with a cross-sectoral approach. The sector level\nmanagement  allows  different  approaches  to  be  used  where  appropriate  and  sector  level\nexpertise to be developed at the same time. The cross-sectoral aspects protect government\nfrom developing inconsistent policies, from financial over-exposure, and ensures that sectoral\nexperience is shared.\n\nd.\n\nInternational or Local Law?\n\nDepending on the stage in development of national legal codes, and the extent to which\ninternational  participation  is  desired,  international  legal  codes  may  be  invoked.  Using\ninternational law can give foreign investors confidence that they will be treated equitably by the\ngovernment. The use of local law, with which a foreign company may be unfamiliar, can increase\nthe price of the contract to government, as the risks are perceived to be greater by the foreign\nbidder.\n\n\f91\n\nInternational laws are most often adopted for dispute resolution. Governments must ensure\nthat any arbitral awards are recognizable under the national legal codes. Concessionaires will want\nto be assured that the awards are enforced in practice.\n\ne.\n\nThe  Concession  Agreement\n\nDespite the need for these specific legal arrangements, the concession agreement specifies\nthe rights and obligations of each party. This is the key legal document. It does not matter what has\nbeen said in the months (or years) of negotiation, or what has been written in the past \u2014 the critical\nrequirement is that the final agreement is understood and acceptable to the parties; for it defines\ntheir contractual rights and obligations, typically for 25-30 years.\n\nBoth governments \u2018and private sector operators therefore need to take the concession\nagreement  very  seriously,  since  it  is  here  that  much  of  their  protection  lies.  The  document\nembodies the principles which they have discussed over the period of negotiation. It is vital that\neverything is included in that document. Both sides will therefore want to employ skilled lawyers\nto help them get the most advantageous agreement. This probably means that they will require\nboth international and national lawyers, each bringing different perspectives and expertise to the\nnegotiations.  Governments,  in  particular,  are  often  unable  to  do  this,  and  are  seriously\ndisadvantaged as a result.\n\nObviously  the  larger  the  contract,  the  more  important  the  agreement.  Where  these\nconcession agreements last for 30 years, there are many more eventualities to be considered\nthan those which cover only a two-year period. As well as this, the longer the period, the more\ncomplicated the financial arrangements are likely to be \u2014 this in itself puts more strains on the\nlegal structures.\n\nf.\n\nLegal Arrangements in the Case Study Countries\n\nTable 18 presents the legal and regulatory arrangements in place in each of the case\nstudy  countries.  Each  has  adopted  a  different  legal  approach.  The  Philippines  has  the  most\ndefined legal environment (having passed two BOT laws) while Malaysia has no specific legislation;\nand Hong Kong, China; defines new legislation (an ordinance) for each project.\n\nThe  absence  of  a  clear  legal  framework  and  BOT  process  has  resulted  in  little\ninternational interest in the expressway projects in Malaysia; however it is important to note\nthat building up local private sector players was one of the government\u2019s key objectives for\ntheir concessioning program. On this criterion the lack of a defined legal environment has not\nprevented  success.\n\n\fTable 18:   Legal and Regulatory Responsibilities in the Case Study Countries\n\nCountry\n\nRelevant Laws\n\nSector Specific or Multi-sectoral Management\n\nNational or Regional\nLevel Management\n\nLevel of International\nInterest/Involvement\n\nNational  (NEDA)\n\nMulti-sectoral co-ordination and approval (NEDA - ICC)\n\nMedium-High\n\nMulti-sectoral  implementation  assistance  and  international\nresponsibilities  (BOT  Center)\n\nSector specific tariff regulation (TAB)\n\nSector specific technical review (DPWH)\n\nPhilippines\n\n1977 TAB Law \u201cAuthorizing the\nestablishment  of  toll  facilities  on  public\nimprovements\u201d\n\n1990 BOT law\n\n1994 Amended BOT law\n\nThailand\n\n1993 Royal Act \u2014 framework for PSP\n\nMalaysia\n\nNone\n\nNational  (EPU)\n\nMulti-sectoral  decision-making  and  economic  regulation  (EPU)\n\nLow\n\nSector Specific concession and technical regulation (MHA)\n\nNational - excl.

While there is no simple and universal answer, a\ncombination of the following is likely to be effective:\n\n\u2022\n\nThe importance of the concession contract as a regulatory tool should, first and foremost,\nbe recognized. The contract allocates risks and rewards between the private and public\nsector parties, by defining legal rights and obligations. Therefore a sound contract should\nbe the starting point for any regulatory framework; this is one that exerts appropriate\nregulatory pressure on both parties. For example:\n\n- Shorter contract periods provide a useful curb on monopoly power.\n- Even for long-term contracts, short-term contracts can be employed with renewal\n\nor extension subject to meeting minimum performance requirements.\n\n\u2022 An independent regulatory framework and regulator is usually seen to be required.\nThis is often specified as requiring to be autonomous, separate from government,\nhaving clear and transparent procedures, and being accountable for decisions. But\nexperience shows this formula is neither unambiguous nor cost-free. What is likely to\nbe required is an autonomous and independent body that is also accountable. The\nsolution  in  each  country  needs  to  be  developed  in  the  context  of  its  particular\ncharacteristics. It is likely that the regulator should be part of government, but quite\nseparate  from  the  agency  responsible  for  promoting,  or  having  a  direct  interest  in\nroads.\n\n\u2022 User groups, if sufficiently empowered (e.g., through an ombudsman function or as\nuser associations) can also exert a useful regulatory role on infrastructure providers. It\nshould be said that this is not yet generally well developed, but could become more\neffective.\n\nA government\u2019s willingness to manage the concession agreement with transparency and\ncommitment quickly becomes clear over the course of one or two transactions. If governments\nact within the confines of the legal arrangements, private sector confidence grows. If governments\nfail to follow these ground rules, then bids for subsequent projects will include substantial risk\npremiums. It is this desire to ensure that competitive pressures on price are retained through the\ncourse of a privatization program which ensures government commitment to agreed processes.\nThis is one of the reasons why private sector players tend to be more interested in a concession\nin a country with a program of concession projects.\n\n40\n\nRegulatory activity can be divided into regulation for the market (covering regulation of market entry, usually by requiring entrants\nto bid for the right to provide services) and regulation in the market (curbing tendencies towards monopoly behavior). Regulation\nfor the market is discussed in section 7.9 \u2014 Procurement. Regulation in the market is the subject of this section.\n\n\f94\n\nThere are two basic forms of regulation: technical and economic. Each can be undertaken\n\n1. Enforcement  of  provisions  laid  out  in  a  concession  agreement  -  through  contract\n\nin two ways:\n\nmanagement.\n\n2. Establishment in the concession agreement of separate processes for regulation (more\nakin to a full privatization process which establishes regulatory frameworks in order to\nprovide confidence for the private sector investors).\n\nThe options overlap in some cases where the concession agreement defines the technical\nprinciples (such as quality of the pavement) while it leaves economic issues (such as escalation of\ntoll rates) open.\n\na.\n\nThe Nature of a Concession Agreement\n\nThere are two different ways of looking at the concession agreement:\n\n1. As  the  Regulation  -  the  concession  agreement  should  determine  the  required\nresponse,  from  concessionaire  and  government,  to  any  situation.  With  this  view,\nregulators are not needed - since regulation is through the contract (or through the\ncourts).  Typically,  the  government  agency  or  its\u2019  representative,  monitors  the\nconcessionaire to ensure compliance with contractual obligations. In some cases\nthey  rely  primarily  on  information  provided  by  the  concessionaires  \u2014  with  some\nspot-checking.  Contractual  enforcement  can  be  through  penalty  payments  or\nreductions in government support payments defined in the concession agreement.\nWhere there is no such prior agreement, or where these mechanisms have failed\nto achieve an improvement in the concessionaire\u2019s behavior, arbitration mechanisms\nare then used. Some contracts specify procedures for arbitration, others call on the\nuse  of  local  dispute  resolution  law  and  others  call  on  international  law.  In  these\ncases contract management is all that is required.\n\n2. As a Guide to the Allocation of Responsibilities. Since concession agreements are\ntypically in place for periods of up to 30 years, and given the dynamic environment in\ndeveloping countries, it is not reasonable to expect that all eventualities have been\nconsidered during the negotiating phase. Hence with this view, the initial agreements\nare seen as setting the basis for future negotiations and instead present the approach\nto  eventualities  (risks  or  opportunities)  which  cannot  be  determined  at  the  time  of\nsigning. In this case, procedures for re-negotiation, including where appropriate, the\nuse of third parties and arbitrators, should be specified in the agreement.\n\nb.\n\nInterests of the Parties\n\nThe attitudes of the concessionaire and government to such concessions are determined\nby their interests. Government may be assumed to be primarily concerned with the public interest,\nwhile  concessionaires  are  often  interested  primarily  in  the  short-term.  Most  expressway\nconcessionaires are contractors (or a consortium dominated by the contractors), whose objective\nis to make construction profits and then exit as soon as financially attractive.\n\n\f95\n\nTheir primary concerns are:\n\n\u2022 Controlling risks during the (relatively short) implementation time.\n\u2022 Having a safe exit strategy, including selling-on at a reasonable price.\n\nThis price will be determined by any or all of the terms of the concession agreement, revenue\n\non opening, and market sentiment towards the profitability of such concessions.\n\nPossible early exit strategies are:\n\n\u2022 Private arrangement \u2014 finding a willing buyer.\n\n\u2022\n\nFloating the project company on the stock exchange - this is done in Hong Kong, China,\nand planned in Malaysia, but has provided no easy answer. The traffic/revenue stream\non opening must be healthy.\n\n\u2022 Defaulting  on  payments  to  government,  or  other  obligations,  and  hence  forcing\n\ngovernment to resort to termination of the concession.\n\nc.\n\nInfluence of the Timing of Re-Negotiation\n\nIf  the  concession  agreement  is  signed,  but  implementation  has  not  occurred,  the\nconcessionaire is in a strong position \u2014 because the government does not want the major delay of\nre-bidding. Once the project is operational however, the government is in a strong position:\nthe facility exists and is used, while the investors have so far received no return.\n\nThe investors are then dependent on arrangements to collect or increase tariffs and for\ngovernment support for the project. These arrangements are typically specified in the concession\nagreement, but often not adhered to by the government in practice (see Table 21). In such cases,\nthe concessionaires tend not to walk away from the project. This is because of the investments\nwhich they have made (and on which they need to reap a return), and in many Asian countries\nthe view that the government would not let them down in the end and hence that profits will be\nmade eventually.\n\nd.\n\nIncentives  for  Government\n\nWhile most governments would claim that they view the concession agreement as the\nregulation,  there  are  few  examples  of  this  being  the  case.  There  are  strong  incentives  for\ngovernments  to  view  the  concession  as  a  guide  in  practice,  yet  claim  that  the  concession\nagreement is binding.\n\ne.\n\nGovernment  Incentives  to  Re-Negotiate\n\nGovernment has many incentives in practice to renegotiate (avoiding re-bidding) when \u2018things\n\ngo wrong\u2019:\n\n\u2022 Governments  enter  into  the  arrangement  because  they  perceive  that  the\ninfrastructure  is  important  for  the  development  of  their  country.  If,  through  minor\nrenegotiation, they can still achieve this objective then re-negotiation is likely to be\npreferred.\n\n\f96\n\n\u2022 Once  the  concession  agreement  has  been  signed  there  are  substantial  sunk  costs  for  the\ngovernment and there is a trade-off between incurring more costs from re-bidding, including\ndelay  to  the  project,  and  incurring  more  costs  through  providing  better  conditions  for  the\nconcessionaire through re-negotiation.\n\n\u2022 A government may well take the view that if the concessionaire is in difficulty then if it were to\nhave undertaken the project as a public sector project with the same conditions, it too would\nhave been in difficulty.\n\n\u2022 Re-negotiation  may  allow  the  government  to  reap  the  benefits  of  new  technologies\nwhich were not feasible at the time at which the contract was signed. For expressways,\nthis  may  apply  to  tolling  options  where  government  is  seeking  to  develop  an\nexpressway network, which requires common technology across the different projects\nwithin the network. In this case, without re-negotiation, the network may be inefficiently\nused for a generation.\n\n\u2022\n\nIt may be realistic and cheaper to separately provide for re-negotiation in the event of\nextreme  circumstances  which  could  not  be  reasonably  foreseen,  e.g.,  economic\ncrises. The alternatives are:\n\n-\n\n-\n\nForce the concessionaire to accommodate all risks within the bid and therefore to inflate\nthe price of the concession \u2014 which is unrealistic.\n\nIf  government  is  unwilling  to  accept  such  possibilities,  the  concessionaire  may\nsimply  ignore  the  down-side  risk,  taking  the  view  that  in  these  circumstances\ngovernment  will  have  to  renegotiate  \u2014  an  approach  which  ignores  reasonable\nrisk allocation.\n\n\u2022 Where the government plans to extend the expressway operated by a concessionaire, he may\nhave the first option to bid. Government can then capture part of any unexpected profits made\non the first concession, through renegotiating that agreement and extending it to incorporate\nthe extension.\n\n\u2022 However, concessions are awarded through a competitive process. In this situation, if\nthe conditions under which the award was made are later changed, losing bidders are\nliable to challenge the legality of such subsequent changes. They may well claim that the\ngovernment would have secured better value for money had it selected their \u201creasonable\nand realistic\u201d bid in the first instance.\n\nf.\n\nIncentives  for  Concessionaires\n\nFor concessionaires, there are several conflicting considerations:\n\n\u2022\n\nThey may feel less confident that a future government will deal with them fairly, hence\nthey  would  argue  for  a  fixed  concession  agreement  from  the  outset.  Otherwise,  each\nnew government represents a new set of risks for the concessionaire.\n\n\u2022 Once  the  concession  agreement  is  signed,  the  concessionaire  is  in  a  strong  position\nuntil the project has been built. Negotiations during this period may allow the concessionaire\nto achieve an improved outcome.\n\n\f97\n\n\u2022\n\nThe concessionaire may recognize that not all eventualities can be foreseen or provided\nfor under the agreement, and therefore may be prepared to carry the risk of arguing for\nre-negotiation in the case of abnormal events, rather than lose the concession.\n\n\u2022 Where  government  wishes  to  impose  change  after  the  event  (e.g.,  in  respect  to\ncompatible tolling equipment to increase use of the expressway network as a whole),\nthe concessionaire may be willing to negotiate on the basis of an assessment of the\nimpact of the change on his commercial position.\n\nAlso:\n\n\u2022 Where governments are weak then the concession agreement may need to be strong\n\nin order for the concessionaire to secure debt financing (and vice versa).\n\n\u2022 Where  the  private  sector  firm  has  international  exposure  and  a  good  reputation,\narguments in favor of a flexible concession can be made. The danger of losing reputation\nmay be sufficient to control the concessionaires behavior.\n\n\u2022 However, international contractors also have international experience which they bring\nto  the  negotiating  table.  This  allows  them  to  drive  a  hard  bargain.  Therefore,  the\ngovernment may not want to reopen negotiations if it has initially secured most of its\nrequirements.\n\ng.\n\nRegulatory/Contract  Management  Arrangements  for  Private\nExpressways\n\nDepending on the structure of the concession contract, contract management may be as\n\nimportant as the regulatory institutions.\n\nContract Management covers technical issues such as:\n\nToll escalation mechanisms.\nToll plaza availability/revenue collection methodologies.\n\nLand acquisition and clearance procedures.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Pavement quality and capacity availability.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Safety management systems.\n\u2022 Environmental policies.\n\u2022 Vehicle weighing stations.\n\u2022 Collection of traffic data.\n\u2022 Commercial  activities.\n\u2022 Payments to government.\n\nControl  authorities  are  usually  an  arm  of  the  road  sector  agencies.  They  often  rely  on\ninformation provided by concessionaires (checking it can be difficult). Reporting requirements for\nthe  concessionaire  are  usually  established  in  the  agreement,  and  include  access  to  financial\ninformation  of  the  company,  quarterly  reports  on  traffic  levels,  road  availability,  maintenance\nundertaken, revenues, etc. The control authority is often the manager of public relations \u2014 the\npublic can be an important source of information on the basis of which the authority will act.\n\n\f98\n\nRegulatory bodies are concerned with economic regulation and may be involved when:\n\nThe tariffs are to be changed \u2014 if there is no agreed formula, but a maximum rate of\nreturn is permitted, for example, it will be the regulator\u2019s responsibility to establish whether\nor not that threshold has been reached.\n\nThe concessionaire calls for further government support for the project.\n\nThe concessionaire seeks to extend/widen the road.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTable 18 presented the relevant laws and the managerial/regulatory framework for the\ncase  study  countries.  It  shows  that  most  case  study  governments  have  selected  a  hybrid\nincluding both sector specific and multi-sectoral arrangements \u2014 usually maintaining economic\nregulation/management in a multi-sectoral body and allowing technical regulation/management\nto take place at sector level.\n\nNational rather than local management has been the norm too \u2014 which reflects in part, the\n\nweakness of the local government but also the undeveloped nature of local institutions.\n\nG.\n\nStructuring  the  Public-Private  Partnership\n\nStructuring  is  the  process  of  allocating  risks  associated  with  a  project  and  project\nenvironment in the light of the interests of the key parties such that an acceptable agreement can\nbe reached. The result is the legally-binding concession agreement that will bind the parties together\nfor up to a generation or more.\n\nPublic-private  partnerships  are  often  perceived  as  the  way  by  which  the  potential\nexcesses of private sector ownership, operation and management of public infrastructure can\nbe controlled by the public sector\u2019s interest in economic efficiency, equity, and the public good.\nIn fact, there is very little theory, practice or experience that can be adduced to demonstrate its\nfeasibility  or  efficacy.  The  PPP  \u201cmodel\u201d  is  not  the  only  method  for  the  introduction  of  PSP,\nwhich is more appropriately characterized as the transfer of specific obligations to the private sector\nfor the provision of infrastructure on agreed terms and determined under conditions of competition.\n\nThe appropriate structure for the introduction of PSP depends on an understanding of the\nidentity and motivations of the various participants, the objectives that PSP is seeking to promote,\nthe choice of PSP modality and, the necessary conditions being present.\n\n1.\n\nThe  Key  Stakeholders\n\nStakeholders in the PSP of an expressway, their interests and how they are impacted by\n\nPSP are set out in Table 19.\n\n\f99\n\nTable 19:\n\nStakeholder Analysis of Parties to an Expressway BOT\n\n            Stakeholder\n\n                Stakeholder Interest\n\n                    How Impacted: +? or --?\n\nPublic Sector\n\nPoliticians\n\nTo  improve  economic  growth,\nstandards of living, quality of life\n\n+ PSP though to deliver domestic and\ninternational  funding  for  expressway  projects\n\n--  Lose  some  control  of  major  infrastructure\nprojects\n\n-- Problem of introducing direct user charges\n(e.g., tolls)\n\n-- Threatened by the uncertainly of handling\nover responsibility of highways to the private\nsector to be financed by way of tolls\n\nMinistry of Transport\nand  officials\n\nTo improve quality and efficiency\nof transport.\n\nDepartment  of\nHighways  and  officials\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nTo improve highway transport\n\n--Threat to their continued role in planning,\ndesigning,  building  and  operating  roads.\n\nTo protect the revenue base, and\navoid inefficient financing of\ninfrastructure\n\n-- Need to provide cash or guarantees in\nsupport of private sector\n+ Possibility  of  additionally\n\nExpressway  Operator\n\n+ Expand profitably, if successful\n\nTo obtain/win a profitable\nconcession\n\nTo obtain/win a profitable\nconstruction  contract\n\nTo obtain/win a profitable tolling,\noperation  and  maintenance\ncontract\n\n+ Expand profitably, if successful\n\n+ Expand profitably, if successful\n\nT A Providers/Advisors\n\nTo profitably provide TA\n\n+ Expand profitably, if profitable\n\nTo finance a \u201cbankable\u201d project\n\n+ Expand  asset  portfolio,  if  successful\n\nTo invest in new sectors of the\neconomy\n\n+ Expand  asset  portfolio,  if  sucdessful\n\nInternational  Financial\n\nTo  dispense  development  finance,\nsecure  developmental  benefits\n\n+ Justify  role  as  development  financiers\n\nTo have access to higher service\nroads, lower journey times, at\naffordable  costs\n\n+  Improved  accessibility\n\n-- Threat of increased travel costs\n\nTo be no worse off\n\n-- To avoid costs imposed by diversion\n\nTo be no worse off\n\n--To  avoid  costs  imposed  through  imposition\nof tolls\n\nPrivate Sector\nProject  Sponsor\n\nContractors\n\nFinancial Sector\nBanks\n\nInstitutional  Investors\n\nOthets\nUsers\n\nOthers affected on\nCompeting  routes\n\nOthers affected on\nExisting  route\n\n\f100\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe principal conclusions are that:\n\n\u2022 PSP involves many more players than the traditional way in which expressways have\n\nbeen procured.\n\nTransfer  of  risk  from  the  public  to  the  private  sector  is  likely  to  be  of  more  positive\ninterest to the private than the public sector, which is more likely to be adversely affected.\n\nThe introduction of PSP in this sector involves the public sector giving up its traditional\nrole of provider, designer, builder, operator and maintainer, and financier. Under PSP the\npublic sector\u2019s role is that of intelligent procurer on behalf of clients who have limited\nexperience of the service, and where the public interest may be difficult to define.\n\nThis is a very different role for government, which is not accustomed to the identification\nand allocation of risks. Traditionally, all risks have been \u2018bundled together\u2019, and governments have\noften been either unaware of, or uninterested in them. Wherever PSP is introduced and practiced,\nwhether in the developed or developing world, the realization of this difference is the key issue that\nmust be understood for PSP to proceed.\n\n2.\n\nKey Conditions for Risk Transfer\n\nInfrastructure-wide studies in PSP have shown that there are four key conditions which\ndetermine the level and type of PSP that is feasible. These conditions must be present to ensure\nthat PSP is feasible and deliverable. They are:\n\n\u2022 Political commitment and stakeholder support to ensure sufficient of the participants\n\nsupport the transfer of risk.\n\nFinancial  feasibility  and  degree  of  cost  recovery  to  ensure  the  project  is  capable  of\nbeing financially self-sufficient over its life.\n\nInformation about the technology employed and the state of the assets so that informed\ndecisions can be taken as to the value of the assets, and the costs of expanding or\nrestoring them.\n\n\u2022 Presence  of  a  regulatory  and  monitoring  framework  that  will  protect  the  users  from\nexploitation  of  a  temporary  monopoly  and  provide  a  basis  for  the  measurement  of\nimprovement of performance, etc.\n\nThe greater the obligations or risks to be transferred, the greater these conditions must be\npresent to ensure the effectiveness of the chosen modality of PSP. Thus, maintenance management\ncontracts require the conditions to be present, but at less onerous levels than for BOT and corridor\nmanagement  concessions.\n\nExperience  from  developed  countries  (and  in  particular  Europe)  has  highlighted  the\nenormous challenge of building tolled expressways in terms of the costs and the risks involved.\nThis  experience  has  demonstrated  the  ambitious  nature  of  many  plans  in  developing  and\ntransitional  states,  and  provides  encouragement  to  start  with  less  onerous  forms  of  PSP  to\nensure greater success.\n\n\f101\n\n3.\n\nRisk Identification and Allocation\n\nMany risks and responsibilities in the highway sector are capable of very clear definition.\nDesign standards for structures and highway surfaces are capable of high levels of measurement\nand definition. Technical specifications, maintenance cycles, and traffic levels can be precisely\nspecified. The impact of the introduction of tolling can be measured.\n\nFor new construction, there are greater unknowns; capital costs of new vehicle crossings,\nbridges or tunnels, the impact of soil conditions on new construction, and the timing of phased\ncapacity expansion contain higher levels of uncertainty. These characteristics of the roads sector\nemphasize the case for allocating measurable risks to private sector participants as the best way\nof  gaining  acceptance  of  the  approach,  and  ensuring  the  costs  of  allocation  and  transfer  are\nminimized.\n\nIt is a principal of project finance that risks are allocated to the party best able to manage\nthem. Diversion from this principle will lead to sub-optimality, and result in higher than necessary\nprices for risk transfer.\n\na.\n\nExpressway Risks\n\nTable 20 summarizes the risks which are typically faced on a PSP expressway. Naturally\nsome apply only to the more ambitious forms, but all are present on many. The list is not meant to\nbe exhaustive, but to illustrate the scale of the problem in allocating and managing risk.\n\n\f102\n\n       Table 20:            PSP Expressway Risks\n\n  Risk Category\n\n                                   Description\n\nDesign\n\n\u2022 Cost of re-design resulting from poor initial design\n\u2022\n\nIncreased  construction  or  maintenance  costs  due  to\ninitial design assumptions\nIncorrect  geotechnical  assumptions  at  design  stage\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Planning permissions\n\u2022 Site  clearance\n\u2022 Failure of designer\n\u2022 Government-imposed  changes\n\u2022 Non-compliance  with  specifications\n\u2022 Designer  the  scapegoat  when  things  go  wrong\n\u2022 Approvals  procedure  leads  to  increasing  costs\n\nInterference  from  third  parties  e.g.,  protesters\n\n\u2022 Unforeseen  preparation  costs\n\u2022 Safety  requirements  not  foreseen\n\u2022 Materials  used  cause  unforeseen  maintenance  costs\n\u2022\n\u2022 Unforeseen  ground  conditions\n\u2022 Unexpected impact of environmental regulations\n\u2022 Land contamination\n\u2022 Noise  restraining  orders\n\u2022 Labor problems\n\u2022 Problems with quality and price of labor, materials and plant\n\u2022 Problems  with  sub-contractors\n\u2022 Site  access  problems\n\u2022 Adverse  weather  conditions\n\u2022 Death or injuries on site\n\u2022 Suspension  of  works\n\u2022 Traffic  diversion  problems\n\u2022 Drainage/flooding problems\n\u2022 Third part claims\n\n Ramp-up longer\n\nImprovements  to  other  competing  roads  reduces  traffic\nImprovements to competing modes reduces traffic\n\n\u2022 Traffic  diversion  lower  than  expected\n\u2022\n\u2022 Few  trucks  use  the  road\n\u2022 Toll increases don\u2019t happen\n\u2022 Toll  increases  adversely  affect  traffic\n\u2022 Failure  to  improve  local  road  access  deters  traffic\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Change to development plan and major concentrations of activity\n\u2022 Government  increases  taxes,  duties  of  vehicles  use\n\u2022 Failure of tolling equipment\n\u2022 Pilferage\n\u2022\n\u2022 Vandalism\n\u2022 Cost and overruns in tolling equipment\n\u2022 Corruption\n\u2022 Force  majeure  -  catastrophic  event  (earthquake,  accident  etc.)\n\u2022 Traffic-related  problems  -  accidents  etc.\n\u2022 Unexpected  additional  costs\n\nIllegal payments to police etc. deters traffic Operational\n\n\u2022 Material and labor cost increases\n\u2022 Pavement failure to high truck use/poor design\n\u2022  Unexpected  weather  problems\n\u2022  Traffic  management  requirements  increase  costs\n\u2022 Non-compliance with maintenance requirements\n\u2022  Inferior  workmanship\n\n\u2022 Legislative delay\n\u2022 Inflation\n\u2022  Currency  crisis\n\u2022  Interest  rates\n\u2022 Insolvency of promoter, contractor or members of consortium\n\u2022 Inability to refinance\n\u2022  Expected  tax  allowances  not  forthcoming\n\u2022 Riot, war, invasion\n\u2022 Change of government\n\u2022  Discriminatory  law  changes\n\nConstruction\n\nTraffic  and\nRevenue\n\nMaintenance\n\nFinance/Other\nRisks\n\n\f103\n\nThe major categories of risk for a tolled expressway, and the party best able to assume the\n\nrisk are as follows:\n\nb.\n\nCompletion Risk\n\nThis is the risk that the project may not be completed, may be delayed or may exceed its\n\nbudgeted cost. Generally:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  government  has  control  over  land  acquisition  and  obtaining  the  necessary\npermissions for the project, and it should assume these risks.\nThe concessionaire has control over the design and construction risk, and he should\nbear these risks.\n\nc.\n\nCommercial Risk\n\nThis is the risk of traffic on opening, the rate of traffic growth, users\u2019 willingness-to-pay tolls,\n\nto some extent the capacity of the road, and the cost of operations and maintenance.\n\nThe concessionaire\u2019s control over commercial risk is only partial. He can:\n\n\u2022 Control his operations and maintenance costs effectively.\n\n\u2022 Utilize the latest tolling technology to maximize the attraction of the facility.\n\n\u2022 Use advertising and public information campaigns to increase awareness of the benefits\n\nof the project.\n\nconcessions.\n\n\u2022 Market  the  road,  for  example,  targeting  major  potential  users,  and  maybe  offering\n\n\u2022\n\nLower toll rates when they are too high, to increase market penetration. Concessionaires\nare, however, reluctant to do this, perceiving that once reduced, they may forego the\nprospect of increasing the tolls later to compensate.\n\nBut the main traffic risk remains. First is the risk of producing good traffic forecasts - often\nthey  are  seen  not  to  be  good.  Second,  the  forecasts  are  dependent  upon  factors  which  are\nsubstantially outside the control of the concessionaire.\n\nThere are many examples of concessionaires taking the traffic risk, and then failing. It is\nincreasingly recognized that, particularly for green-field projects, where traffic is particularly uncertain,\ntraffic risk should be shared.\n\nOne promising solution is for \u2018super-profits\u2019 resulting from higher than expected traffic to\nbe shared, together with downside guarantees by government, in the event that traffic is much\nlower than expected. This reduces the project risk, and avoids the politically difficult accusation\nagainst government officers when faced with super-profits (that the deal may not have been let\nproperly).\n\n\f104\n\nd.\n\nFinancing Risks\n\nConcessionaires use debt to leverage their equity, thereby increasing their returns. Moreover,\nthis debt provides a mechanism for distributing risk among the parties. All project proponents face\nthe risk of obtaining financial terms which are inferior to those expected (e.g., when interest rates\nare higher than expected). To a certain degree, however, concessionaires have control over the\nfinancing terms, via their negotiating skills, track record, and bankability. Financing risks should\ntherefore be borne by the concessionaire.\n\ne.\n\nDevaluation and Inflation\n\nThese are major risks, as the recent economic crisis has demonstrated. These are primarily\nwithin the control of government, and it is appropriate for government to assume these risks. This\nis normally done through incorporation in the toll escalation process.\n\nf.\n\nDefault  and  Force  Majeure\n\nThese contract provisions have a major impact upon the risk that the concessionaire and\nthe banks are willing to assume. For example, the Government of the Philippines insists that if the\nconcessionaire defaults, the project be taken over by the banks. In the case of Government default,\nthe proponent needs to be compensated. Again, in the Philippines, in some cases, the proponent\nagrees to be compensated for the remainder of the concession period the projected net income\nbased on the original financial model, while in other cases, a lump-sum payment is agreed in the\nform of debt guaranteed by Government.\n\ng.\n\nTariffs and Financing\n\nToll rates are regulated to protect users from paying excessively high rates, and governments\nusually seek to keep tolls as low as possible. But this must be balanced against the imperative to\nfinance the road. A number of issues typically arise:\n\n\u2022\n\nThe willingness of motorists/companies to pay toll rates, and the feasibility of introducing\nthem is determined by many factors. These include the level of existing tolls if any, and\nwhether the existing road has hitherto been free, e.g., for people who made decisions\nabout where to live on the basis of free roads, and then found high tolls imposed. The\ncase is entirely different for new roads. Typically therefore tolls are low when introduced\non existing roads, but can be high on new roads.\n\n\u2022 Government should be clear about the use of the toll-road it seeks, and the tariffs should\nbe  set  accordingly,  and  incorporated  in  the  concession  agreement.  It  is  common\nexperience that tolls for all traffic are too high, or that tolls for trucks are too high, or that\nbuses are charged high tolls. It is sometimes argued that \u2018governments have no money\u2019\nand that this is necessary. But this sometimes misses the point, for:\n\n-\n\n-\n\nLower tolls results in increased traffic, and often increased revenues too, and this\ndecongests the existing roads \u2014 so everyone benefits.\n\nLower tolls for trucks will often increase revenues too, and reduce the environmental\ncosts of trucks traveling through existing centers.\n\n\f105\n\n-\n\nLow tolls for buses may contribute importantly to social equity objectives, at small\ncost to government. The question should be what trade off between these objectives\nshould be.\n\n\u2022\n\nTariffs should be escalated, on the basis of an agreed formula. These formulae have a\nhuge impact upon the projected return of concessionaires, and may typically take many\nmonths and iterations before agreement is reached.\n\nh.\n\nEscalation Formulae for Toll Rates41\n\nThere are different approaches, for example:\n\n\u2022 Return  on  Rate  Basis  \u2013  this  estimates  the  allowable  revenue.  Each  year  operating\nexpenses  are  reimbursed  and  the  concessionaire  is  given  a  defined  return  on  his\ninvestment, inclusive of working capital. The tariff is the allowable revenue divided by\nthe estimated traffic at the toll plaza.\n\n\u2022 Return on Equity \u2013 a financial model of the project is built, and the escalation formula\nmakes provision for changes in inflation, devaluation and possibly interest rates. An\nallowable return is determined, based on returns for similar projects and the toll rate\nrequired to achieve this return is calculated.\n\n\u2022 Project Return \u2013 this is as for return on equity except that it does not consider financing.\nThe financial return is calculated assuming 100 percent equity, and the allowable project\nreturn determined, based on returns for similar projects and the toll rate required to\nachieve this return is calculated.\n\nEach  method  has  its  pros  and  cons.  These  include  the  following  issues  upon  which\n\ngovernment needs to decide its position:\n\n\u2022 Stability of the tariff over time.\n\n\u2022 Willingness to provide traffic guarantees \u2013 it is argued above that these risks should be\n\nshared.\n\n\u2022 Willingness to participate in financing risk \u2013 it is argued above these should normally be\n\nborne by the concessionaire.\n\n\u2022 Provision of incentives for efficient operation \u2013 these should be provided.\n\n\u2022 Extent of government regulation that is required. This may simply be limited to operating\nand  maintenance  standards,  or  it  may  also  include  checking  allowable  operating\nexpenses, or may include financing.\n\n\u2022 Ease by which the toll escalation is computed.\n\n41\n\nWhat follows describes the policy of the Government of the Philippines, described in their \u2018General Features of\nFinancial Aspects of Negotiated Toll Road Agreements\u2019, dated 12/04/98.\n\n\f106\n\nThe last project return approach is the one adopted by the Government of the Philippines.\nIt  retains  the  advantages  of  the  return  on  equity  methodology,  and  has  the  additional\ncharacteristics:\n\n\u2022 No regulation is required relative to financing.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe concessionaire assumes the financing risk.\nIt may be wise to ensure a minimum equity commitment by the concessionaire to ensure\nhis  commitment.\nIt targets a project return of 20 percent, in dollar terms. This is benchmarked against\nreturns  in  other  countries,  and  takes  account  of  the  specific  circumstances  in  the\nPhilippines. It provides for tax breaks in accordance with local practice.\n\n\u2022\n\nAccordingly, implementing rules have been devised that provide a transparent basis for the\n\ncalculation of tariff reviews, which may be increased annually.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nIntroducing PSP in the roads sector involves the transfer of obligations from the public to\nthe private sector on terms that are negotiated under conditions of competition. Inevitably, the\nchange can involve shifts in traditional patterns of power and control that are difficult to surrender.\nExperience  has  shown  that,  in  many  cases,  PSP  has  yielded  significant  improvements  in\nproductivity, capacity expansion, and performance.\n\nHowever, PSP must be targeted with the appropriate objective, otherwise sub-optimal\nsolutions may result. Secondly, the appropriate PSP option must be chosen. Thirdly, the correct\nmodality will be determined by the presence of the key conditions of stakeholder support, financial\nfeasibility, regulatory and  monitoring framework, and knowledge of the state of the operating\nassets and their current performance. Fourth, risk should be carried by the party best able to\ncontrol or insure against it. The extent to which risk can be transferred in practice will depend on\nindividual  circumstances.\n\nH.\n\nFinancing\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSecuring debt has always been a limiting factor in this sector. While many entrepreneurs\n\n(mainly contractors) have promoted projects, banks have always been wary.42\n\nThe recent economic crisis has clearly exacerbated this situation considerably, and in the\n\nfuture:\n\n\u2022\n\nThere is likely to be less equity - entrepreneurs that have had their fingers burned are\nnow more cautious, and the Japanese economy has reduced the funds that contractors\nand trading houses have to invest abroad.\n\n42\n\nThis  section  concerns  securing  private  sector  risk  capital.  In  Asia  there  are  examples  of  private  sector  capital  being\nbacked  by  government  -  this  is  no  more  than  a  contingent  public  sector  liability,  and  does  not  help  secure  PSP\nobjectives,  through  risk  transfer.\n\n\f107\n\n\u2022\n\nThere is likely to be less debt. Asian, especially Japanese, banks have less to invest\nand are more careful about where they invest.\n\nThese changes are being reinforced by the general downgradirtg of many sovereign\nshort  and  medium-term  credit  ratings,  following  the  re-alignment  of  a  number  of  Asian\ncurrencies.\n\nThis is a sobering background given that banks are able to invest anywhere and in any\nproduct. They will only invest in road sector concessions if the expected returns are comparable\nwith other opportunities, given their overall portfolio strategy.\n\nFinancing comes at the end of the PSP process, but the constraints it imposes must be\nconsidered  from  the  outset.  If  a  sound  business  case  has  been  prepared,  the  project  risks\nidentified and allocated in a realistic manner and the procurement process credible and well\nexecuted, then financing should follow on the basis expected. But if these preconditions do not\nexist it may well not be available.\n\n2.\n\nProject  Characteristics\n\nThis section looks specifically at expressway financing characteristics.\n\nRevenues are difficult to forecast because:\n\n\u2022 Revenues derive from tolls which must be introduced on previously free routes.\n\n\u2022 Some traffic will be diverted by the introduction of charges. The impact on traffic volumes\n\nis difficult to forecast, and changes over time.\n\n\u2022\n\nTraffic levels are low initially and uncertain in the medium/long term.\n\n\u2022 Depending on the tolling method and strategy introduced, there are many opportunities\n\nfor toll avoidance, toll loss (through uncollected tolls), and toll undercharging.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nToll levels must be affordable based upon users\u2019 willingness-to-pay.\n\nToll  levels  can  be  revenue  maximizing  (desired  by  project  sponsors)  or  socially\nmaximizing (desired by governments to ensure the highest utilization). The objectives\nof the public and private sectors are always in conflict.\n\nTolls  structures  must  not  have  the  effect  of  discriminating  against  certain  groups  of\nusers.\n\nToll escalation mechanisms often suffer from political interference.\n\n\u2022 Non-toll revenues \u2013 i.e., from advertising, other retailing concessions, etc are small -\n\nand yield typically perhaps five percent of total revenues.\n\n\f108\n\nCapital costs are lumpy and difficult to phase:\n\n\u2022\n\nLand acquisition costs are an important proportion of overall costs (typically\n15 percent, but up to 50 percent in the center of big cities).\n\n\u2022 Expressways must be built in anticipation of future demand.\n\n\u2022 While there are phasing options, they are rarely exercised, and in any case many costs\n\nmust be absorbed in advance, e.g., earth works, bridges, culverts, etc.\n\n\u2022 Necessary  tolling  equipment,  plazas  etc.  often  involves  foreign  technology,  and  the\nplanning,  design  and  management  process  increases  the  requirement  for  foreign\nexchange.\n\nOperating costs:\n\n\u2022\n\nTolling,  maintenance,  and  related  costs  typically  amount  to  15  percent  of  gross  toll\nrevenues, and place a substantial burden on early debt service capacity.\n\n\u2022 A variety of additional services (lighting, communications systems, signage, safety and\nemergency services) are required on limited access, high service expressways.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe existing alternative routes must still be maintained.\n\nThe resultant expressway project cash flow is typically:\n\n\u2022 Highly dependant on traffic volume growth to repay debt.\n\n\u2022 Burdened by large front end costs in land acquisition.\n\n\u2022 Weakened by the possibility of the emergence of competing routes.\n\n\u2022 Susceptible to political interference in route selection and in the toll increase mechanism.\n\nIn addition to these difficulties specific to tolled expressways, there are additional obstacles\n\nto be overcome in the financial markets and in the legal and regulatory spheres.\n\n3.\n\nImpediments to Financing\n\na.\n\nFinancing Obstacles\n\n\u2022 Expressways require long term debt \u2013 15 years or more.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTo avoid foreign exchange risk, borrowings should be in local currency. However, the\ncapital markets of many emerging market countries do not have sufficient long-term\nstructures; and even if the term structure is available, funds are frequently dedicated to\nother kinds of projects, carrying lower perceived risk.\n\nInflation adds further burdens to financing costs and risks. At the extreme, high inflation\nprecludes domestic borrowing.\n\nIf domestic borrowing is not available, then an element of foreign funding is necessary.\nHowever, foreign borrowing is no substitute without a natural hedge.\n\n\f109\n\nForeign exchange risk for the portion of the funding borrowed in foreign currency and\nrepayable in foreign currency must be covered in the toll; yet large shifts in currency\nrates can render some expressways beyond the means of the users to pay. Recent\nevents in Asia emphasized the critical importance of this.\n\nb.\n\nLegislative  Impediments\n\nThere are legal requirements in most countries for the availability of a free alternative\nroute.\n\nThere is sometimes (as in countries of the Asian sub-continent) a legal requirement for\ntolls to be removed after debt is repaid, leaving no dedicated funds for long-term operation\nand maintenance.\n\nThere has been success in recent legal challenges to the government\u2019s right to levy\ntolls, in the absence of specific legislative powers to do so (this is currently an issue in\nHungary).\n\nc.\n\nRegulatory Impediments\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe absence of a regulatory framework is not always bad, however, there needs to be\na body that looks after the public interest through: controlling tolls, controlling the returns\nto operators, and protecting against competing roads in the same corridor.\n\n\u2022 Problems arise where there are conflicts within government for control of the regulatory\n\nfunction.\n\nGiven these obstacles, it is not surprising that investment by the private sector in tolled\n\nexpressways has required a large element of support by the host government.\n\n4.\n\nGovernment  Support\n\nGovernments can improve the financial viability of expressway projects in many ways. They\n\nmay do so by:\n\n\u2022 Reducing construction costs through the grant or purchase of land, endowment of\nexisting  highway  assets,  the  provision  of  other  inputs,  and  reduction  of  taxes  on\ninputs.\n\n\u2022 Reducing the operating costs through support in the initial years.\n\n\u2022\n\nIncreasing the returns to sponsors through corporation tax holidays on equity earnings.\n\n\u2022 Retaining certain risks that are not transferable at a reasonable cost such as shortfall\n\nguarantees on opening traffic volumes.\n\n\u2022 Providing  guarantees  for  the  availability  and  conversion  of  foreign  exchange\n\nborrowings.\n\n\u2022 Providing project credit guarantees, (such as traffic short fall guarantees) to the banks\n\ninvited to finance the projects.\n\n\f110\n\nThe  more  that  actual  and  contingent  risk  is  retained  or  absorbed  by  government  on\nbehalf of sponsors and banks, the lower are the PSP benefits that are believed to arise. Many\nof the expressway projects in Malaysia and Indonesia have depended heavily on government\nsupport,  to  the  extent  that  the  projects  have  become  virtually  contingent  risks  on  the\ngovernment\u2019s balance sheet. Much government support has been wrested from governments\nby strongly placed sponsors through superior negotiating tactics, close connections with political\nparties, or brinkmanship by threatening to withdraw from the project that has already begun.\nSome government support is neither visible nor strengthens the project (as opposed to the\nsponsor\u2019s  investment).\n\nThe solution is neither difficult nor unavailable. Effective government support must be\ndesigned and specified at the time the project is being prepared by the relevant agency for\nexecution. Specification and design of the support package is an integral part of establishing\nthe financial viability of the expressway project - as fundamental as understanding the capital\ncosts, the tolling strategy, the initial traffic volume and levels and structure of opening tolls.\n\nThe  costs  associated  with  preparing  and  bidding  for  expressway  projects  could  be\nsubstantially  reduced  if  the  nature  and  quantum  of  government  support  was  to  be  made\navailable at the time of tendering. Very often, this is not the case, but only emerges during\nnegotiations.  Further,  it  should  be  made  clear  that  the  ministry  of  finance,  which  in  most\ncountries is the relevant authority to provide support, has agreed to the support, and that the\nsupport is available.\n\n5.\n\nGuarantees  and  Insurances\n\nThere are three generic sources of guarantees and insurances:\n\n\u2022 Government guarantees - from the concessionaires point-of-view these are \u2018free\u2019\nand are always sought; but from the public sector viewpoint, they reduce the transfer\nof risk, and hence the basic purpose of the PSP process. Traffic volume guarantees\nare  frequently  sought  by  private  promoters  and  sponsors  of  expressway  projects\n(often on behalf of banks). Even if granted, however, these can be of doubtful value\nunless the guarantor is able to fulfill the guarantee, and the guarantor is able to exercise\nit. Contingent risks of many governments are only now being adequately accounted\nfor. Many commercial banks have a much more limited appetite for sovereign risk\nthan governments would like to think.\n\n\u2022 Guarantees taken out by the government, to improve the project finances and\nhelp attract finance. Like all guarantees, these come at a cost, and the greater the\nrisk  the  greater  the  cost.  One  recent  innovation  promoted  by  the  international\ndevelopment finance institutions is to provide specific guarantees \u2014 the partial credit\nguarantee and the partial risk guarantee \u2014 that address specific structural problems\nin the ability of financial institutions to participate:\n\n-\n\nThe partial risk guarantee, guarantees that a government-owned body, which is\nparty to a contract, will meet its obligations under the contract. It is provided in\nfavor of a project\u2019s lenders, where the project\u2019s output is sold to a state-owned\nenterprise with a weak creditworthiness. A good example is an electrical power\ndistributor. In event of the purchaser\u2019s failure to pay, the guarantee is called, and\nthe project lenders avoid a loan default, with all the consequences. The partial\n\n\f111\n\nrisk  guarantee  has  limited  application  to  expressways,  except  in  the  case,  for\nexample, where a state-controlled highway authority with responsibility for paying\nsupport (or shadow tolls) was unable to pay.\n\n-\n\nThe partial credit guarantee is used to extend the term structure of debt. It has the\neffect of purchasing from project lenders the portion of the loan that is outstanding\nat, say, 10 years, which might be part of a loan requiring a 15-year maturity. Lenders\ncan then commit funds for 15 years knowing that they require funding for only 10\nyears.  This  form  of  guarantee  has  applicability  in  those  countries  where  a\nsatisfactory expressway project may be established, but where the credit markets\nare unable to commit and fund loans for the full term.\n\nSuch guarantees are provided by ADB and the World Bank, but to date have had little\ntake-up, in spite of several attempts to repackage them. Firstly, recipient governments\nare generally unwilling to counter-guarantee the grantor of the guarantee (usually a\ndevelopment bank) - they want cash not contingent guarantees. Secondly, there are\nmore  fundamental  project-related  credit  issues  that  cannot  be  overcome  by  the\nguarantee route.\n\n\u2022\n\nInsurances - these are normally taken out for very infrequent but calamitous events\n-force majeure. They can help, but insurers never lose money from project finance -\na large risk will, therefore, carry a high-risk premium.\n\nThe overall conclusion is that guarantees and insurances can help in putting a financing\npackage together, but they do not make a big difference and they are not an easy solution to\nresolving the problems that exist.\n\n6.\n\nExpectations of Equity and Debt Providers\n\nNotwithstanding the difficulties outlined above, expressways continue to be planned and\n\npromoted in many emerging, industrializing, and transitional countries.\n\na.\n\nEquity\n\nSponsors  or promoters  of road schemes are frequently the principal equity providers.\nExpressways  are  relatively  low-tech  infrastructure  projects,  unlike  power  stations,\ntelecommunications  facilities,  railways  or  airports.43 Sponsors  are  frequently  contracting\ncompanies, which themselves are not well capitalized. Their ambition is frequently to make a\nsufficient profit in construction, then to exit once the project is open. The returns from operating\nthe facility over 20 to 25 years are less important to them.\n\nInstitutional investors, however, require a risk-adjusted return on their investment (usually\nexpressed in US$ or some other hard currency) of at least 20 percent before tax. These figures\nare known from the various publicly listed companies that have been floated in South East Asian\nmarkets. These levels of return are difficult to achieve on large equity investments,\n\n43 \n\nThe  introduction  of  electronic  tolling  considerably  increases  this  complexity.\n\n\f112\n\nand are threatened by the very public source of the toll revenues that underpin them. Returns to\nestablished toll operating companies in developed markets are below this threshold, typically\nreaching a percentage rate of return in the mid-teens, before tax.\n\nb.\n\nDebt\n\nCommercial banks that are persuaded to support expressway BOT projects are driven\nby different requirements. Discerning banks will expect a soundly based project where the risks\nhave been realistically identified and allocated to establish general creditworthiness. The bank\nwill then consider the security package offered in support of the transaction in the event that the\nproject cash flows do not materialize as planned. Finally, they will consider whether the loan fits\nwith their strategy and portfolio, whether it can be funded, and the adequacy of the fees and\npricing, e.g., the margin they will receive over the funding costs.\n\nBanks may seek additional security, they will frequently seek a higher margin. In the\nfinal analysis, they are looking for well-structured lending opportunities where they believe the\nborrower will service the loan as planned, by paying the interest costs and repaying the principal\nat the times agreed.\n\n7.\n\nTypical Financing Structures\n\nTheories as to the right or appropriate financing structure abound. There are as many\nfinancing structures as there are financiable projects. The limited recourse financing structure of\ninfrastructure tends to be a function of the shape of the cash flows available to service it and the\nsecurity package offered.\n\nThe funding structure for an expressway project typically comprises:\n\n\u2022 Bank senior debt - debt that has first call on the available cash flows (and security).\n\u2022 Subordinated capital - debt with second call on cash flow and security.\n\u2022 Equity - capital that is fully at risk.\n\na.\n\nBank  Senior  Debt\n\nIn most cases, the limiting factor in financing an expressway is the amount and term of\nsenior debt that a project is able to attract. This is usually determined by the ratio of the project\ncash  flow  to  the  debt  service  requirements.  Banks  often  seek  1.5  times  the  debt  service\nrequirement. This can be reduced to a lower margin through changing the repayment schedule\nor providing additional security or support. Bank senior debt might typically provide 60 percent\nof total project costs, including interest during construction and inflation. Banks will lay down\nthe  terms  and  conditions  on  which  the  loans  would  be  advanced  and  these  would  typically\ninclude the requirement that all equity should be paid into the project company before any debt\nis available.\n\nb.\n\nSubordinate  Capital\n\nFrequently there is a requirement for further finance, neither debt nor equity. This gap\nfinance is increasingly offered by the development finance organizations in support of their\nefforts to support PSP. In several Asian countries, investment funds are established to provide\nthe subordinated debt. Terms typically stipulate a minimum equity contribution, a commercial\n\n\f113\n\nmargin occasionally with a carried interest in the equity, and a counter guarantee from the host\ngovernment.\n\nc.\n\nEquity\n\nTo obtain the required return to equity, there is a tendency to risk as little as possible.\nThe less put at risk, the higher the eventual return for the same cash flows available to the\ninvestors. Notwithstanding this, equity amounting to 20 percent of the capital costs is not an\nuncommon requirement. More equity will reduce the overall rate of return. Less equity will not\nconvince the banking community that there is enough at risk to ensure the full co-operation of\nthe investors.\n\nA desirable capital structure might be:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n60 percent commercial debt.\n20 percent subordinated capital.\n20 percent equity.\n\nHowever, when the government has made a significant contribution in kind, such as an\nexisting section of expressway or the corridor on which tolls will eventually be charged, it may\nretain an interest, or require a profit-sharing arrangement to be developed. This permits it to\nrecover some return on the original public stake, or to ensure the equitable division of returns\nonce the expressway has attained profitability.\n\nIn the final analysis, the capital structure is the result of negotiation among players with\nvarying degrees of market and political power, influence and resources. Rarely is the structure\nfully efficient. Banks are often required to take risks they are unprepared for. Often, governments\nare forced to retain risks that reduce the benefits of PSP. The relatively few transactions that\nhave  been  concluded  and  the  long  time  required  establishing  the  success  of  the  transaction\nmeans that the costs of failure are still to be assessed.\n\nThere is much debate about whether government should hold an interest in the project\ncompany to which the risks are transferred, and in some countries (such as Indonesia), this is\nobligatory. Arguments for so doing include the government\u2019s need to safeguard interests and to\nensure  against  abuses  of  the  monopoly  power  of  the  private  sector  under  the  concession.\nArguments against, include the need to ensure that the private sector toll operators\u2019 powers are\nsufficiently regulated in the concession agreement. In any event, the private sector cannot be\nexpected  to  be  responsible  for  social  objectives  that  the  government  might  wish  to  pursue.\nContinued government involvement can also lead to management inefficiencies and unresolvable\nconflicts  of  interest.  The  growing  sophistication  of  concessions,  monitoring  and  performance\ndevices  further  reduces  the  case  for  a  continuing  role  for  the  government  in  the  concession\ncompany.\n\n\f114\n\n8.\n\nAvailability, Sources and Terms of Debt\n\na.\n\nAvailability\n\nReference has been made to the exchange rate and convertibility risks imposed on a\nproject resulting from dependence in infrastructure projects on domestic revenues to repay foreign\nborrowings.  These  risks  affect  the  project\u2019s  ability  to  meet  all  its  financial  obligations,  and\ndependence on foreign financing significantly reduces the number and scope of projects that\nmight be financed compared to the situation which would exist were domestic sources of funding\nto be available.\n\nHigh and volatile inflation rates also shorten the investment horizon and distort economic\nactivity. Although long-term investment in a high inflation environment can be funded by loans,\nprovided  a  high  nominal  interest  is  charged,  inflation-adjusted  interest  rates  are  not  a  viable\nsolution. In particular, they create problematic cash flows, not solved by compressing the loan\nrepayment schedule. A record of low and stable inflation is usually required to extend a country\u2019s\nfinancial horizon. It is also a decisive factor in developing long-term fixed income securities that\nare so necessary in financing major infrastructure projects.\n\nIt  is  not  surprising  that  the  price  volatility  and  swings  in  economic  activity,  frequently\nexperienced in developing countries, even those growing at high rates of growth, have limited the\ndepth and breadth in their capital and credit markets. Availability of domestic finance is therefore\none  of  the  most  serious  obstacles  for  the  expansion  of  PSP  in  infrastructure  throughout  the\ndeveloping world.\n\nGeneral pre-conditions for the availability of appropriate infrastructure finance are:\n\n\u2022 A sound macro economic environment.\n\u2022 Stable prices.\n\u2022 Stable exchange rates.\n\nThose countries with developed financial regulatory frameworks monitoring the capital\nmarkets (stock exchange), and credit markets, (banks) are best favored to supply appropriate\ninfrastructure financing instruments.\n\nb.\n\nSources\n\nThere are four main sources of debt for infrastructure projects such as expressways:\n\nCommercial  Banks  -  commercial  banks  have  played  a  very  small  role  in  financing\ninfrastructure,  due  to  the  maturity  structure  of  their  liabilities.  There  is  simply  not  the  deposit\nstructure to permit long-term funding on a matched basis. Commercial banks in some developing\ncountries are the subject of interventionist policies, particularly where state-owned enterprises\ndepend on policy-driven credit decisions. In some developing markets virtually all bank credit is\nallocated and governments impose controls on how bank assets are held.\n\nThe  current  economic  crisis  is  expected  to  lead  to  substantial  restructuring  of  many\ndomestic and foreign banks in Asia. A viable project finance banking community should emerge\nas a result of rationalization and re-capitalization of the commercial banks.\n\n\f115\n\nBonds and Bond Markets - Fixed-rate bonds are among the most suitable instruments\nfor long-term infrastructure, provided there is sufficient stability and predictability in the project\ncash flows. If inflation is likely to change rapidly, investors will seek shorter terms and floating\nrate instruments to protect against swings in real interest.\n\nPre-conditions  are  the  existence  of  a  government  bond  market  against  which  project\nbonds can be priced. At present, the term structures of government bond markets are limited\n(typically seven years), and are thin at the longer-term horizons.\n\nBond  rating  agencies  and  credit  enhancement  are  ways  of  overcoming  these\ndeficiencies. However, investor interest in long-term project bonds, denominated in other than\nstrong currencies, is severely limited. It is likely to require a period of stability to return in Asian\nproject  and  currency  markets  before  bonds  are  likely  to  be  available  for  long-term  project\nfinancing.\n\nPension Funds and Domestic Institutional Investors - A significant provider of project\ndebt for infrastructure in Asia and South America has been the major state pension funds and\ncontractual savings systems. Previously required to invest in government securities, permissible\ninvestments have been progressively widened to include infrastructure. Also, pension funds are\nincreasingly permitted to invest some small part of their funds in equity rather than first ranking,\nsecured debt.\n\nDomestic savings institutions are likely to re-assess their exposure to projects during the\npresent downturn in Asia. It is likely that some institutions will be reassessing their policies in the\nlight of the performance of some of the projects. 1999 will no doubt constitute a watershed for\ndomestic savings institutions, as they understand the impact on their portfolios of certain project\nfailures. It will be a test for their understanding and management of project risk. They will emerge\nstronger as a result of the experience.\n\nc.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn a scale of 1 (low) to 4 (high), the short and medium-term prospects for funding in the\n\nsector from these four sources of debt may be along the following lines:\n\nSource\n\nShort-Term\n\nMedium-Term\n\nCommercial  banks\nBonds\nPension  Funds\nInstitutional  investors\n\n1\n2\n3\n3\n\n3\n3\n4\n4\n\nI.\n\nProcurement\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRegulatory activity can be divided into two broad categories:\n\n\u2022 Regulation for the market \u2013 covering regulation of market entry, usually by requiring\n\nentrants to bid for the right to provide services.\n\n\f116\n\n\u2022 Regulation in the market \u2013 curbing tendencies towards monopoly behavior.\n\nRegulation for the market \u2013 this is generally agreed to require open and competitive\nbidding. Without this, the evidence is that corruption and/or nepotism may prosper to the detriment\nof achieving public policy objectives.\n\nProcurement involves:\n\nThe development of government\u2019s business case.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Marketing of the project to potential bidders.\n\u2022\n\nThe  bidding  process  leading  to  contract  award  and  negotiation  of  the  concession\nagreement.\n\n\u2022 Supervision of implementation - until the project is operational.\n\nProcurement in PSP is the process by which the terms and conditions on which the risks\nto be transferred from the public to the private sector are determined and negotiated. It is the\nprocess of achieving a PSP project in accordance with the stated objectives of the public party\nwhilst achieving the requirements of the bidder and lenders. A project will not proceed if the latter\ncondition is not satisfied, it should not proceed if the former condition is not satisfied. There is a\nrequirement for a procurement process which can effectively achieve both conditions without\nsuch a drawn out and costly bureaucratic process as to dissuade bidders from participating in\nPSP.\n\nSuccessful  procurement  depends  upon  realism  and  preparation,  transparency,  and\n\ncompetition, and clearly defined procedures, through the procurement framework.\n\nRealism  and  preparation  -  some  governments  have,  in  the  past,  demonstrated  an\nunjustifiable optimism that any project offered to the private sector will be enthusiastically taken\nup. There were also private sector players who ignored hard realities and initiated and promoted\nprojects that from the outset would clearly not be viable candidates for public-private partnership,\nexcept with excessive public sector funding. There were investors who did not make a thorough\nand realistic assessment of an opportunity, resulting in their demanding unreasonably hard and\nsafe terms or else accepting terms and conditions which would lead to failure; in either case\nundermining the credibility of the approach.\n\nThe  financial  consequences  of  inadequate  project  preparation,  from  a  government\u2019s\nviewpoint, could be serious. If the technical, traffic demand or financial aspects of the project are\nnot thoroughly investigated and understood by the government\u2019s negotiators, then the resulting\nconcession terms could represent a bad use of public funds. On the other hand, if because of\nlack of preparation, government negotiators fail to recognize ways in which a project could be\nmade to work, then the provision of vital infrastructure might be delayed.\n\nTransparency and competition - Comprehensive procurement processes are adopted\nin many cases. But there are many instances where PSP projects have been progressed - by\ndefault or design - without full assessment of public interest issues and without transparency\nand competition. Since a government is effectively creating a form of private monopoly, albeit\nlimited by time, caps on charges, and restrictions on prospective rates of return etc., it should\nnormally  wish  to  ensure  transparency  of  process,  and  competition  for  the  market  the  private\nsector will operate, to ensure the public interest is protected.\n\n\f117\n\n2.\n\nProcurement Frameworks\n\na.\n\nCommon Practice\n\nWhere a component of a highway project which involves PSP is to be financed with a\ncontribution  of  one  of  the  multilateral  development  banks,  this  may  determine  the  form  of\nprocurement  -  specifically  there  may  be  a  requirement  to  procure  under  conditions  of\ninternational competitive bidding or at least on the basis of comparable unit prices. In other\ncases, government procurement in many countries is determined on an ad hoc basis. The\nneed for improvement is well-recognized and much is being done to develop and promote\nbetter practice.\n\nSome of the countries which have embraced PSP, have recognized the need to overcome\nthe reputation for bumpy playing fields and cronyism that had developed through previous regimes.\nOther countries which are trying to promote PSP, for example Bangladesh, India and Pakistan\nare  continuing  in  their  efforts  to  formalize  policies  and  procedures.  But  much  remains  to  be\ndone. While the private sector is encouraged to contribute its experience and innovation in a\nvariety of ways, the process is sometimes subverted, for example:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe grant of concessions prior to finalizing the terms and conditions assumes that\nthe consortium will act in the public interest.\n\nThe type and quantum of government support the consortium might be able to negotiate\nmight lead to some of the project risks not being transferred.\n\n\u2022 A continuing interest that a government agency might have in the concession company,\nor  its  regulation  may  lead  to  unacceptable  conflicts  of  interest,  or  inadequate\ncompetitive challenges.\n\nb.\n\nBetter Practice in Asia\n\nThe Philippines\u2019 efforts in establishing a procurement framework, introduced as part of\nthe policy to promote PSP, provides one possible model. The process was launched in 1993\nthrough legislation and accompanying regulations.44 The process was linked with government\u2019s\npolicy  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment  and  to  implement  the  priorities  of  the  national\ndevelopment plan.\n\nThe procurement process was and is facilitated by the BOT Center, which markets projects\nto the private sector, and provides services and assistance to implementing agencies and to\nlocal government in the development, bidding and implementation of infrastructure projects. In\nthis way the BOT Center supports and advises government - and helps to ensure it understands\nand can fulfil its undertakings, and can facilitate and influence the entry of project sponsors and\nfinanciers into the country\u2019s PSP program.\n\n44\n\nRepublic Act No. 7718 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.\n\n\f118\n\nThe procurement framework comprises the following stages:\n\n\u2022 Project prioritization and approval.\n\u2022 Marketing to bidders.\n\u2022 Pre-qualification of bidders.\n\u2022 Evaluation of proposals.\n\u2022 Award of contract.\n\u2022 Project implementation.\n\nRegulations govern the manner and timing by which the framework is operated by the\nresponsible  line  ministry.  The  existence  (and  acceptance)  of  the  procurement  framework  for\nPSP is a substantial advantage to both bona fide bidders and professional civil servants, and\nimportantly is sending the message that government requires effective procurement performance.\nThe Philippines process - not without critics and problems in its adoption and operation - does\nhave the following strengths:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nIt promotes transparency and competition.\nIt informs all parties as to the procurement process, their roles and responsibilities.\nIt increases confidence and promotes credibility generally.\n\nBecause of insufficient resources and proposal evaluation skills, projects are reportedly\nnot being prepared as thoroughly as they should. This is not a fault of the process but of its\nresourcing.  Other  concerns  relate  to  the  objectivity  of  the  process  when  line  ministries  joint\nventure with the private sector, and to its susceptibility to political interference. That said, the\nBOT  law,  and  the  process  it  supports,  is  an  effective  step  in  introducing  a  more  credible\nprocurement mechanism, which is now evolving with experience.\n\nc.\n\nBetter  Practice  Elsewhere\n\nIt is clear from experience in the developed world that the process of public procurement\nis becoming increasingly important. With the UK Government\u2019s Private Finance Initiative (the\npolicy by which private management, techniques and finance are introduced to wide areas of\npublic economic and social infrastructure), a 14 stage procurement process has been recently\nadopted.\n\n45\n\nThis  process  concentrates  on  establishing  the  business  case  for  the  infrastructure\nneed, the options for both public and private sector provision, and measuring the value that the\nprivate  sector  solution  is  capable  of  delivering  compared  with  the  public  sector  alternative.\nThere is also a specific approval of the public sector affordability of any private sector solution,\nand confirmation of the availability of the funding support that is required through the life of the\nproject.\n\nOnly when a project\u2019s outputs are fully and thoroughly defined, when its value for money\nover  the  competing  public  option  are  quantified,  and  when  the  mechanisms  and  quantum  of\nsupport is determined and secured, is the task of concession award considered. This concern\n\n45\n\n Step by Step Guide to PFI Procurement, HM Treasury, July 1997.\n\n\f119\n\nwith  project  design,  risk  transfer,  and  value  for  money  reflects  the  importance  attached  to\nminimizing the costs to bidders and satisfying the government that the process avoids controversy\nand criticism. It could be considered in developing countries as a way of building confidence\namong international investors, bankers, and private sector participants.\n\nSince UK is a member of EU, which aims to facilitate the free flow of goods and services\nbetween member states, the UK must also abide by EU procurement rules. The first stage of the\ntendering  process  is  a  call  for  interested  parties  to  pre-qualify  through  the  placement  of  an\nappropriate advertisement in the Official Journal of the EU.\n\nFrom the pre-qualified applicant, a short list of up to seven potential bidders is then invited\nto tender, usually with carefully specified criteria for determining the winner. The process might\ninvite the bidders to offer alternative methods of supplying the services, differences in phasing,\nor mechanisms for payment. However, they would need to be presented in a manner consistent\nwith the compliant bids to ensure that award was based on consistent criteria.\n\nAfter initial evaluation in accordance with the published criteria, a preferred bidder would\nbe selected for the presentation and negotiation of a best and final offer. The runner up would be\ninvited to step in, should agreement not be finalized with the preferred bidder. Once negotiations\nare completed, the contract or concession is awarded and the bidder proceeds to financial close,\nwhere the financing is put in place.\n\nWhile considered by many to be bureaucratic and time consuming, the general advantages\nof this process are that it minimizes costs to bidders, and provides the procuring authority with\nadequate competition to protect the public interest.\n\n3.\n\nBusiness  Case\n\nOnly when government has prepared a demanding Business Case, will it understand the\nfinancial and risk characteristics of the project. Then, in preliminary discussion with the market\n(potential bidders and bankers), it will be in a position to understand how/whether risks can be\nallocated such that it can confirm government\u2019s willingness to proceed - given the public sector\nsupport which will be necessary, and the terms which will be necessary to attract keen bids.\nOnly with this information can government negotiate meaningfully.\n\nThe failure to prepare an authoritative Business Case is therefore risky for government. It\nmay lead to no project, or it may lead to an unsatisfactory agreement. Only when government\ntechnocrats are properly informed will they be confident in negotiations, and will the process be\nefficient. This is sought by the private sector too, they would much prefer to negotiate with an\ninformed client than one who is not prepared.\n\n\f120\n\nThe Business Case is specifically concerned with:\n\nThe legal basis for a concession.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nLand  -  acquisition,  associated  resettlement,  and  permissions  necessary  for\nconstruction.\n\nThe roles of government in implementation, operations and regulation (who does what\nin government).\n\nThe revenue stream, on which financing critically depends. What are the risks? Can\nthey be mitigated and/or supplemented?\n\nThe risks - and developing the basis for risk allocation between the parties.\n\n\u2022 Establishing the right balance between the key stakeholders, in the light of their interests\n\nand expectations - users, sponsors, investors, and government.\n\nThe requirement and form of government support - in terms of financing, guarantees\nand other incentives.\n\n\u2022 Establishing procedures for ensuring that the government support provides good value-\n\nfor-money.\n\n4.\n\nThe  Potential  for  Innovation\n\nUnsolicited bids pose a particular problem, since governments usually wish to encourage\nprivate sector innovation, which is seen by the private sector as in conflict with competitive bidding.\nThe solutions to this are typically:\n\n\u2022 Either a formalized, tight but open competitive bidding procedure, which gives the\nprivate proponent an in-built advantage in that he tends to know more about the\nproject than the competition (having been involved in developing it from the beginning).\nThis has in the past been administered in Hong Kong, China to demonstrable effect.\n\n\u2022 Or  a  price-matching,  in  which  case  competing  bids  are  invited  after  acceptance  by\ngovernment  of  a  pre-emptive  proposal.  If  the  competitive  bid  is  better,  the  original\nproponent has the opportunity to match the terms, and contract award is made. This\napproach has been applied in the Philippines.\n\nNeither  of  these  approaches  is  entirely  satisfactory  in  typical  developing  country\nenvironments.  Very  often,  the  project  timescales  stretch  out  without  contract  award,  to  the\nincreasing frustration of all concerned. It is becoming clear that there should be a progressive\nshift towards assisting government identify potential PSP projects - which should then be subject\nto competitive bidding.\n\nTypically, it has been found that government must define the route, identify the junction\nrequirements, specify the vertical alignment (elevated/at-grade/underground), and define the land\nenvelope  needed  (i.e.,  commit  to  clearing/acquiring  land).  The  concessionaire  may  be  given\nfreedom to offer innovation in: design - e.g., structure versus embankment - with far-reaching\nenvironmental as well as cost consequences; in devising tolling arrangements; and in devising\ntariff structure.\n\n\f121\n\n5. Implementation\n\na.\n\nAccess to Expert Advice\n\nThe PSP world is characterized by much specialism, and it is essential for government to\nhave access to the same expert advice which is the norm in the private sector; yet to date, this\nseldom been possible.\n\nThe BOT Center approach implemented in the Philippines has been described, and this\ngoes a considerable way to providing this expert advice in fields such as project finance, legal\nissues and documentation, negotiation etc. But even here, there is need for access to world-class\nplayers in many cases.\n\nThere are mechanisms to achieve this, and it is a role where development banks can play\na pivotal role. For example, a PSP Fund may be set up, initially by a development bank, and thereafter\nsustained by allocations from the bidding process (a fixed fee per bidder, increasing towards contract\naward, in return for government\u2019s front-end activity identifying and preparing the project). The purpose\nof the fund could, for example, cover project identification, bidding and negotiation - and would\nenable government to access international and local experts in a responsive way. Such a fund\ncould be for a single sector or multi-sector.\n\nb.\n\nMarketing\n\nIt is not the case that there are many bidders and banks waiting to implement any project,\nquite the opposite in fact. So it is essential that the procurement process and specific projects are\nactively marketed to interested parties. Part of this process to understand the market sentiment to\nthe country/sector/project, and this should help determine the terms of the bidding. The result of\ngood marketing is stronger consortia and potentially more competition. Marketing takes the form of\ndelivery of full technical, legislative, economic, financial, and environmental summaries to targeted\nparties who are likely to have an interest.\n\nc.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe principal document to be negotiated is the Concession Agreement, which sets out the\nprincipals that determine the relationship of the Concession Company with the government entities.\nAt the center of the concession document are the obligations and responsibilities of the parties, the\nterm of the concession, and the basis for termination and for hand back, if a BOT.\n\nThe contents of a BOT concession typically include the following:\n\n\u2022 General definitions \u2013 Project description, guarantees, financial model.\n\n\u2022 Operations \u2013 Land requirements, design and construction, construction program,\ninspection, operations and maintenance, management, hand back, insurance,\ngovernment obligations.\n\n\u2022 Relationship and monitoring \u2013 Representatives, records, reports and information,\n\nmonitoring of performance, other parties responsibilities.\n\n\u2022 Payment mechanisms \u2013 toll levels, toll structures, escalation formula, other revenue\n\nearning enterprises.\n\n\f122\n\n\u2022 Changes, liabilities and terminations \u2013 Change procedure, force majeure, indemnities,\n\ndefault, termination, compensations.\n\n\u2022 Miscellaneous provisions \u2013 Assignment of rights, consents, taxes, dispute resolution,\n\nwaivers, amendments, governing laws etc.\n\nMany schedules are attached which contain detailed information and data.\n\nIn addition to the concession agreement, there is usually a substantial enabling legislative\ntask for government permitting the concession company to commence its activities, regulations to\nbe  enacted  and  land  to  be  resumed  or  acquired.  Following  the  award  of  the  concession,  the\nconcession company\u2019s major task is securing the financing which prior to then has been studied\nand may have been underwritten on a contingent basis.\n\nd.\n\nBidding and Evaluation\n\nThe purpose of the bidding procedure is to secure effective competition up to the point of\ncontract signature. There is much experience of how best to do this and the case studies provide\nexamples.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nMany who have been involved in this process emphasize the importance of three issues:\n\nThe value of having simple evaluation criteria - this sector is suited to such criteria. For\nexample:\n\n-\n-\n\neither submit the lowest tariff for agreed government support\nor submit the lowest level of government support for defined tariffs.\n\nThe  importance  of  specifying  the  project  requirements  closely,  to  ensure  that  the\nevaluation is indeed comparing like-with-like.\n\n\u2022 Offering  the  opportunity  for  bidders  to  submit  non-conforming  bids,  in  addition  to\n\nconforming bids. This is designed to secure innovative ideas from the private sector.\n\ne.\n\nEnsuring Value for Money\n\nThe  test  of  good  procurement  is  ensuring  that  the  private  sector  solution  is  more  cost-\neffective than the public alternative. This requires the public sector to estimate what the public\nsector costs would have been. The UK DBFO program puts great effort into designing reliable\n\u2018public sector comparators\u2019, but for developing countries the information is often not available to do\nthis. Instead benchmark costs of similar projects can be assembled - for the country in question,\nand internationally. This will allow bid prices to be benchmarked against best practice.\n\nPSP in the provision of infrastructure is a relatively recent innovation in both the developed\nand the developing world. PSP was formerly excluded \u2018on the grounds that, other things being\nequal, the public sector could still borrow to finance projects more cheaply than the private sector,\nwhich would require a risk-related return on the funds employed. There were also misgivings about\nthe private sector\u2019s behavior and the ability to safeguard the public interest.\n\nConsumers  of  public  services  have  discovered  that  political  interference,  shortage  of\nfunds  and  poor  management  have  caused  the  performance  of  many  publicly-owned  and\noperated  services  to  decline.  It  has  been  realized  that  the  benefits  of  private  sector\n\n\f123\n\nmanagement, technology, preparedness to invest and innovate often outweigh the saving in financing.\nFurthermore, many governments admitted they could not raise the finance required.\n\nWhile availability of finance has been the principal reason for governments to consider PSP\nin developing countries, the challenge remains for governments to satisfy themselves that private\nownership, construction, operation, management, and financing is a better alternative than a public\nalternative. Procurement executives should be mindful that the public sector comparator, however\nmeasured, is the cost that the private sector option should not exceed.\n\nJ.\n\nSupport for, and by Government\n\n1.\n\nSupport  for  Government\n\nIt is not uncommon for government officers to be ill-prepared when facing private sector\nnegotiators across the table. Often the private group will have world-class lawyers, financial advisers,\nand technical experts. By contrast the government side will often have no prepared business case,\nnor have access to specialists in the fields which PSP requires.\n\nPerhaps, surprisingly, this is not welcomed by the prospective concessionaire, because\nthe negotiations are unlikely to be effective, and may be prolonged, or fail for no good reason other\nthan that the government side have no informed basis from which to negotiate.\n\nA major improvement can be made in the PSP process if government technocrats are able\nto access such advice to prepare projects for PSP, at bidding and during negotiations. There are\nsome excellent examples of how this can be done:\n\na.\n\nExample: Philippines BOT Center\n\nIn 1995, a BOT Center was established under the Office of the President, with the United\nStates Agency for International Development funding assistance to fast-track the BOT process.\nThis is small (25 staff in total, with 5 consultants on average), and focuses on:\n\n\u2022 Assisting  line  agencies  prepare  projects  -  assistance  to  the  BOT  Units  in  the  line\n\nagencies, such as DPWH.\n\n\u2022 Assisting them negotiate by providing specialist expertise, e.g., in legal and project finance\n\naspects.\n\n\u2022 Marketing projects internationally to potential investors.\n\n\u2022 Developing changes to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the BOT Law.\n\nIn the roads sector, this has been effective. It could be more effective if funding was available\nfor agencies to prepare projects for joint public-private funding. This is currently under consideration\nas part of an ADB project preparatory TA.\n\n\f124\n\n2.\n\nSupport by Government\n\nSometimes, once the concession agreement is signed, the government stands back. Yet\n\nactive government support is essential for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 Government needs to fulfill its requirements under the contract - particularly in respect\nto  acquiring  land  free  of  encumbrances  and  securing  the  necessary  permissions.  It\nalso needs to provide the support defined in the contract.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe road is an instrument of public policy, (to improve accessibility, open up areas for\ndevelopment etc.). The more effective the government support, the greater the project\nbenefits are likely to be - and the more successful the project. This should be a \u2018win-win\u2019\nsituation, benefiting road users, government (through profit-sharing arrangements) and\nthe concessionaire; but only rarely is this so.\n\nThis is particularly necessary to integrate an expressway into the road network, and\nensure that its competitive position is not undermined by other projects. Action is often\nnecessary away from the expressway site to secure good access to the expressway,\nand only government can do this.\n\n\u2022 Government must deliver on its committed reviews/increases in tariffs, on which the\n\nfuture project finances depend.\n\nTable 21 establishes whether political intervention has occurred in the toll and competition\narrangements after the concession agreement for toll roads has been finalized. It illustrates clearly\nthat either government underestimates the pressures that will arise in practice, or that contracts\nare entered into somewhat cynically. It seems that the government has little incentive to abide by\nagreements once the facility is in place.\n\nTable 21:\n\nDid the Agreed Price and Competition Policy Prevail?\n\n   Country\n\n                                        No\n\n          Yes\n\nArgentina\n\nToll rate reduced\n\nMexico\n\nAustralia\n\nUS\n\nIndia\n\nHungary\n\nRiots led to the removal of tariffs\n\nSouth  Africa\n\nLocal politicians agreed to improve a parallel free road\n\nPhilippines\n\nNo toll increases between 1983 and 1994\n\nHong Kong,\nChina\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nCross Harbour Tunnel increases not permitted (tax\nimposed  for  congestion  control).

BEST PRACTICES\n\nA.\n\nBest  Practices\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\na.\n\nNeed for a Process\n\nDeveloping a pipeline of PSP projects in the road sector requires government to\n\ndetermine a process, which comprises the following activities, at two different levels.\n\n\u2022 Sector Level:\n\n\u2022 Project Level:\n\n- Preparing the PSP environment \u2013 legal, regulatory, and contractual.\n\n-\n\nIdentifying PSP projects in the context of a transport strategy and the realistic level\nof public sector support necessary, both investment and contingent investment.\n\n- Preparing a business case for each project, to establish the basis for bidding, and\n\nconfirm this is acceptable to government.\n\n- Securing competitive bids and negotiating leading to bid award.\n\n- Providing support and enforcing the concession agreement during construction.\n\n- Enforcing the concession agreement and regulating effectively during the concession\n\nperiod.\n\nThe economic crisis has reinforced on governments the need for increased transparency\nin the PSP process, and increased rigor in project preparation since they are now faced with a\nbetter  informed,  and  more  cautious  investment  community.  Governments  are  likely  to  need\nassistance until this demanding process is established both at the roads sector level and more\ngenerally in structuring the PSP environment.\n\n2.\n\nThe  PSP  Environment\n\na.\n\nCountry Conditions\n\nNot everywhere is suited to PSP, and particularly to major BOT projects. PSP is likely to be\n\nfavored in countries where there is:\n\n\u2022 Political leadership and commitment to a PSP policy.\n\u2022 Political stability.\n\n\f                                                               126\n\n\u2022 An existing income level which is not low - and preferably an income distribution which\n\nis equitable.46\n\n\u2022 A sound macro-economy, creating increasing output and real income growth.\n\u2022\nLow and stable inflation.\n\u2022 A stable exchange rate.\n\u2022 Domestic capital markets capable of providing domestic financing.\n\u2022 A  program  of  concession  projects  builds  private  sector  confidence,  and  allows\n\ngovernment and the private sector to spread the learning-curve costs.\n\nThe absence of any one of these features may not kill the prospects for PSP, but a country\n\nlacking the second or third will likely struggle to introduce effective PSP.\n\nb.\n\nProject  Characteristics\n\nSome  types  of  projects  are  more  likely  to  be  capable  of  implementation  and  financing.\nBroadly speaking the implementation and financing challenge increases with the size and complexity\nof the PSP option (Figure 5) and the challenge for government increases similarly.\n\nFor many countries the entry route into PSP in roads should be through maintenance and\noperating concessions.  This  allows the private sector and government to become familiar with\nperformance-based  contracting,  and  offers  the  prospect  of  tackling  the  maintenance  and\nrehabilitation problems, common in countries.\n\nThe focus of most countries to date has however been BOT expressways. Many of these\nhave not been financial successes. The characteristics favoring private financing of major BOT\nexpressways are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Projects down existing heavily-trafficked/congested corridors, or where there are missing\nlinks in the network, e.g., estuarial crossings or tunnels. This maximizes traffic prospects\non opening, and minimizes land/relocation costs.\n\n\u2022\n\nInter-urban, as opposed to urban projects. This keeps the implementation problems\nand cost relatively low, reduces the traffic risk, and is likely to be effective in tackling\ntraffic congestion.\n\n\u2022 Elevated  or  preferably  at-grade  alignments  in  cities,  and  at-grade  construction  for\n\ninterurban projects. This keeps construction costs low.\n\n\u2022 Projects in middle-income developing countries, preferably with an equitable income\ndistribution. Here the willingness-to-pay tolls and the prospects for traffic growth exist.\n\n46\n\nThis  is  important  because  as  country\u2019s  income  increases,  project  benefits  and  revenues  increase  proportionately,  but  costs\nmuch less so. The result is that project profitability increases, and the need for government support reduces. Conversely low-\nincome countries require substantial government support, yet are unlikely to be able to provide it rationally because other projects\nshould often have higher public investment priority. Where income distribution is equitable, car ownership and use increases.\n\n\f127\n\n\u2022\n\nTariffs close to revenue-maximizing, and with an appropriate tariff escalation formula\nthat allows potential revenues to be captured over time, for the main vehicle classes.\n\n\u2022 Projects with an existing income stream, e.g., from an existing estuarial crossing/tunnel,\n\nor an existing public sector expressway. This is hugely beneficial to financing.\n\n\u2022 A project that has been well prepared - in technical terms, in securing planning consents\nand in proving the feasibility of land acquisition, thereby reducing implementation risks.\n\n\u2022 A  large  project,  which  recognizes  the  high  fixed  bidding  costs  associated  with  BOT\n\nprojects.\n\n3.\n\nPreparing  the  PSP  Environment\n\nPolitical leadership is essential. Institutions may need to be restructured, with the objectives\nof controlling the PSP process in the public interest, avoiding tendencies for corruption or empire\nbuilding, and creating a regulatory body, separate from vested sector interests.\n\nThe core requirements are:\n\ncountry specific.\n\n\u2022 Developing an acceptable PSP legal framework \u2013 the exact nature of which will be\n\n\u2022 Securing competition for the market. Government should identify good projects and\nthen subject those to competitive bidding (rather than the widespread existing practice\nof  accepting  unsolicited  bids).  Where  unsolicited  bids  are  accepted,  they  should  be\nsubject to realistic competition.\n\n\u2022 Securing competition in the market. This requires:\n\n-\nLegally-binding  concession  agreements  which  clearly  set  out  the  rights  and\nobligations of all parties, and the procedures to be followed in the event of unforeseen\nevents.\n\n- Establishment  of  an  autonomous  and  independent  regulator  which  is  also\naccountable. This is likely to be in government, but quite separate from vested sector\ninterests.\n\n- Encouragement of user-groups maybe empowered through an ombudsman function,\nto exert pressure on infrastructure providers.\n\n\u2022 Granting  concessions  only  after  government  has  determined  they  are  clearly  in  the\n\npublic interest, and can be revoked if this is not met.\n\nMulti-lateral support for government is likely to be beneficial in implementation. A model that\nhas worked well combines a multi-sector PSP Center with PSP cells in the main line agencies.\nThe main PSP Center has the brief to assist line agencies prepare, market and negotiate projects,\nand is staffed accordingly.\n\n\f128\n\n4.\n\nIdentifying PSP Projects\n\nThis is a government function, which must take place in the right institutional setting if the\n\nresults are to be accepted and implemented.\n\nPriority projects must be identified in the context of a transport (or roads) strategy\n\n, in a\n\n47\n\ntwo-stage  process.\n\na.\n\nPrepare Transport (or Roads) Strategy\n\nThis is required to:\n\npreparation.\n\n\u2022 Be acceptable, which means that all affected stakeholders should be involved in its\n\n\u2022\n\nIdentify the package of policies and priority projects which best promote development\nobjectives, given an assessment of existing problems and available future public funds.\n\n\u2022 Specifically, highlight those projects/programs which may be implemented under PSP\narrangements,  having  regard  to  strategy  objectives  and  the  range  of  PSP  options\navailable.\n\nTable 22:        The PSP Options\n\n         Strategy Objective\n\nMaintenance\n\nTurkey\n\nROT\n\nBOT\n\nMaintain &\nOperate\n\nCorridor\nManagement\n\nNew Source of Funds\n\nMajor capacity increase (New Road)\n\n\u00d6\n\nImproved  Maintenance\n\n\u00d6\n\nRehabilitation  of  existing  roads\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n\u00d6\n\n47 \n\n A transport strategy is normally required for cities, and inter-urban corridors where modal competition can be effective\n\n\f129\n\n5.\n\nIdentify Priority PSP Projects\n\nGovernment must prepare feasibility studies, which will allow it to commit to specific projects.\nAgain, the institutional setting is central to achieving acceptability, and requires the participation of\nthe key stakeholders. This form of feasibility study requires:\n\n\u2022 A  focus  on  optimizing  the  project  specification,  and  delivering  a  project  with  robust\ncharacteristics. Specifically, the potential of the project to promote development, social\nand environmental objectives as well as economic efficiency should be addressed.\n\n\u2022\n\nTariff policy should be set in the light of government objectives.\n\n\u2022 A focus on implementability and financing.\n\n\u2022 A scope including all those activities which affect government\u2019s decision as to\n\nwhether to go ahead (technical, economic, financial, institutional, legal and land).\n\n6.\n\nPreparing the Business Case\n\nThis  is  required  to  confirm  the  decision  to  let  the  project,  and  identify  the  terms  of  the\nbidding in the knowledge of the likely market response; hence contact with potential bidders is\nnecessary. This in-depth analysis should:\n\n\u2022 Establish the project financial structure.\n\n\u2022\n\nIdentify the nature and scale of all the project risks.\n\n\u2022 Define the balance between government support and provisions (such as defined tariffs)\n\nto secure specific government objectives.\n\n\u2022 Allocate risks between government and the concession company. Experience suggests\n\nthe following is likely to be appropriate at a general level.\n\nTable 23:           Risk Allocation\n\n      Responsibility  of  the\n          Government\n\n        Responsibility  of\nConcession  Company\n\n                          Risk\n\nCompletion\n\n\u2022 Land  Acquisition/permissions\n\n\u2022 Design\n\n\u2022 Constrution time/cost\n\nDevaluation and Inflation\n\nDefault and Forse Majeure\n\u2022 By Concession Company\n\u2022 By Government\n\nCommercial \u2013 operations and maintenance cost\nCommercial \u2013 Traffic Revenue\n\nJoint, government sharing in \u2018super-profits\u2019, and providing\ndownside  guarantees\n\n48\n\nFinancing\n\n(government  support)\n\n                 \u00d6\n\n                 \u00d6\n\n                 \u00d6\n\n               \u00d6\n                   \u00d6\n\n               \u00d6\n\nAgreed  with  the  banks\n                 \u00d6\n\n               \u00d6\n\n48\n\n  This is likely to be particularly necessary for projects on green-field sites.\n\n\f130\n\n\u2022 Define the provisions for unforeseen events and specify the procedures for renegotiation.\n\n\u2022 Confirm that the proposed allocation of risks and government support are likely to attract\n\nserious bids.\n\nGovernment should not normally be an equity holder in the project company, as the parties\nhave different interests. Rather, the concession agreement should foster common views, by revenue\nsharing and provision for project extensions.\n\n7.\n\nSecuring Competitive Bids, Negotiation, and Award\n\nThe basis for bidding follows directly from the business case. International marketing to\npotential investors may be necessary to maximize market interest. Success in attracting serious\nbidders requires the existence of an acceptable PSP process, realism in the balance of risks and\nrewards  offered,  confidence  in  the  government  resulting  from  its  past  performance,  and  good\ntiming given the external macro-economic environment.\n\nIt is necessary to establish a clear bidding and negotiating process:\n\n\u2022\n\nThe project requirements need to be specified closely, to ensure evaluation of bids can\nbe equitable.\n\n\u2022 Government support should be defined, where necessary as a maximum - rather then\nheld back for negotiation. This allows the private sector to prepare realistic bids, and\nhelps avoid failed bids.\n\n\u2022 Government  should  have  access  to  expert  advice  during  the  entire  process,  from\npreparation of bid documentation through to contract signature. The private sector will\nhave such advice and governments need to be equally well-prepared.\n\n\u2022\n\nThere is merit in having simple evaluation criteria - for example, bidding at defined tariffs\nto  minimize  the  level  of  government  investment  required  since  it  gives  transparent\ndecisions.\n\n\u2022 Conforming  and  non-conforming  bids  should  be  allowed,  to  foster  private  sector\n\ninnovation.\n\nGovernment should establish whether and to what extent PSP projects achieve value-for-\nmoney, by comparing costs with the best public sector alternative. Government should also seek\nto establish, through before-and-after audits, how expectations are matched by reality - as a basis\nfor continuous improvements to the PSP process.\n\n8.\n\nSupporting Implementation and Operations\n\nGovernment should be proactive during this period, with the objective of maximizing the\nsuccess of the project. Government will administer the concession contract, and regulate on an\nagreed  basis  in  the  public  interest.  When  unforeseen  circumstances  occur,  government  must\nfollow the procedures set out in the concession agreement.\n\n\f131\n\nB.\n\nRole for ADB and Prospects\n\n1.\n\nRole for ADB\n\nThere is widespread recognition by government technocrats and private sector players,\nthat ADB needs to be increasingly involved in this area. Government because they require technical\nassistance in restructuring and reshaping of policy, as well as in funding and other support; and the\nprivate sector because they require technical assistance support to secure financing arrangements\nor appreciate that ADB assistance can help government to determine sector policy. This offers\nencouragement for ADB\u2019s continued role in supporting PSP. Table 24 summarizes the potential\nrole for ADB in sector activities identified in this study as priority for the coming five years. There are\nfive areas for ADB assistance as follows:\n\na.\n\nPreparing the Environment and Procurement Process for PSP\n\nADB is active here, and has been so for some years. The requirement is to extend that\n\nassistance now when it is clearly required and can reap substantial benefits.\n\nb.\n\nBroadening Understanding of the Range of PSP Options that exists\nin the Roads Sector.\n\nMost  PSP  options  are  currently  not  applied  in  Asia,  and  they  provide  an  undoubted\nopportunity, as experience elsewhere demonstrates. In particular, they tackle the problems of\nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation,  which  underlie  the  problems  of  the  roads  sector  in  most\ncountries.\n\nc.\n\nAssisting Transport Strategy Formulation.\n\nThis is necessary for identifying priority PSP projects within an integrated transport sector\nframework. Policy dialogue and coordination with the World Bank and JBIC is necessary. Together\nwith ADB, the three agencies are the major providers of assistance to Asia\u2019s governments in the\nroads sector. At a time of considerable change, it is particularly important that a consistent message\nis delivered.\n\nd.\n\nAssisting Preparation of Priority Projects.\n\nThe case study visits demonstrated that there is a role for ADB, recognized by the public\nand private sector alike, in assisting to prepare projects for implementation. This is beginning to\nhappen, and the message is that more is required. This should be done with regard to the range of\nPSP options available, and the difficulties in delivering public-private sector (so-called hybrid) projects\nat times of uncertainty. It is not yet clear how the different imperatives of ADB and the private sector\ncan best be combined, when faced with an uncertain environment. Experimentation is required to\nestablish how this is best achieved.\n\n\f132\n\nTable 24:\n\nRole for ADB\n\nLegal\n\nAssist Create Effective PSP Environment\n\u2022\n\u2022 Regulatory/institutional\n\u2022 Contractual\n\nBroaden Understanding of the PSP Options\n\u2022\n\nIdentify PSP programs and appropriate PSP options.\n\nAssist Transport Strategy Formulation\n\u2022 Develop  sound  integrated  transport  strategy.\n\u2022\n\nIdentify  priority  projects.\n\nDevelop PSP Capabilities\n\u2022 Develop center(s) of PSP expertise\n\u2022\n\nEstablish Project Preparation Fund(s) to prepare PSP projects,\nand to access experts, both domestic and international for procurement.\n\nInvest in Projects\n\u2022 Catalyze financing for PSP projects.\n\ne.\n\nInvesting in Projects\n\nThrough ADB\u2019s public and private sector windows, and where appropriate by providing\nguarantees  (partial  risk  and  partial  credit).  ADB  both  lends  for  a  project  under  a  sovereign\nguarantee,  to  assist  in  funding  the  public  sector  activities,  and  can  also  invest  in  equity  and\nprovide  debt  on  the  private  sector  side.  These  activities  are  widely  recognized  to  leverage\nsubstantial  additional  funds  in  projects  that  ADB  has  determined  are  sound  investments  and\nshould be continued and enhanced.\n\n2.\n\nProspects\n\nFinally, the implications of the recommendations of this technical assistance are considered.\nWhat impact might these changes produce? Of course every country is different and the following\nis no more than an illustration of the impact (Table 25).\n\n\fTable 25:\n\nPossible Impact of the Recommendations\n\n               PSP Option                                                     Percentage of Road Network\n                                                                          Present                +5-10 Years              +25 Years\n\n133\n\n73%\n\n25%\n\n0%\n\n0%\n\n0%\n\n2%\n\n0%\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n0%\n\n0%\n\n40%\n\n2%\n\n5%\n\n35%\n\n3%\n\n15%\n\n100%\n\n0%\n\n100%\n\n0%\n\n50%\n\n5%\n\n15%\n\n0%\n\n5%\n\n25%\n\n100%\n\n0%\n\n100%\n\nPrimary  Network\n\nMaintenance \u2014 government\n\nMaintenance \u2014 management\ncontract\n\nTurnkey\n\nMaintain and Operate (toIl)\n\nRehabilitate, Maintain and Operate\n(toll or Road Fund)\n\nCorridor Management\n\nBOT\n\nTotal\n\nSecondary  Network\n\nMaintenance \u2014government\n\nMaintenance - management contract\n\nThe main features are:\n\n\u2022 All activity should be performance-based, by the private sector (no more government\n\nforce-account, and contracts where reimbursement is based on inputs).\n\n\u2022 A rapid development of maintenance management contracts (funded from a ring-fenced\n\nRoads Fund).\n\n\u2022\n\nThe rapid development of ROT contracting, where there has been a prolonged failure of\nmaintenance.

The information\npesented  was  collected  during  the  case  study  visits  and  has  been  supplemented  with  other\ninformation. Considerable efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, but in some respects this is\ndifficult,  for  example  project  costs.  The  primary  intention  is  to  identify  the  processes,  types  of\nprojects and the degree of success achieved in these very different environments.\n\nThe key features of the Philippines experience are:\n\n\u2022 An early start in the private provision of roads.\n\u2022 An exclusive focus on build-operate-transfer (BOT) expressways \u2014 though none are\n\nyet open.1\n\n\u2022 A strong focus on the legal arrangements for private sector involvement.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe importance of the unsolicited bid.\nThe dominance of Metro Manila.\n\nThe power crisis at the turn of this decade was the origin of the current BOT process in the\nPhilippines. During the administration of President Ramos (1992-1998) Government policy has\nincreasingly centered upon mobilizing the effective participation of the private sector in service\ndelivery,  to  assist  the  Philippines  in  competing  for  business  in  globalized  markets.  This  policy\nthrust is at the center of the next National Development Plan (1998-2004). The early thrust in the\npower sector has broadened, and now transport is a major part of the BOT program.\n\nIn the roads sector the North and South Luzon expressways (linking Manila with the north\nand south of Luzon Island) were constructed under World Bank loan assistance almost 30 years\nago. An operating franchise was awarded under the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB) Law to a private\ncontractor Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) who were required\nto levy tolls, and maintain the roads \u2014 until the capital cost was amortized. Following losses in the\nMiddle East, CDCP became a predominantly publicly-owned company, now renamed Philippine\nNational Construction Corporation (PNCC). Recently, tolls were removed and the roads reverted to\nGovernment, but because of a failure to maintain them, a further franchise was given to PNCC to\ncollect tolls for maintenance.\n\n1    Subsequently the first short section of Skyway has opened.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 2\n\nThe original PNCC franchise has a major impact upon the roads sector to this day, for it\nreferred to the named expressways together with links between them, extensions to them, and\nlinks to them. In practice, while open to interpretation, this includes many of Manila\u2019s proposed toll\nroads, and each new road effectively extends the original franchise for another 30 years. Another\nfranchise was awarded to the Public Estates Authority (PEA) for the development of an expressway\nacross reclamation in Manila Bay.\n\nThis history explains the twin-track legislative basis to expressway development in the\n\nPhilippines:\n\nJoint ventures with PNCC or PEA under the TRB Law.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Competitive bids (either solicited or unsolicited) under the BOT Law.\n\n2.\n\nLegislative and Institutional Framework\n\nThe Manila North and South Expressways were funded and implemented by Government\n\n(under World Bank loan assistance). Subsequently, under the Marcos administration in 1977:\n\n\u2022 Presidential Directive 1112 established TRB. The Directive authorized \u201cthe Establishment\nof Toll facilities on Public Improvements, Creating a Board for the Regulation Thereof\nand for Other Purposes\u201d. TRB was required to approve all toll rates, following public\nhearings.\n\n\u2022\n\nThen under Presidential Directive 1113, CDCP (a major Filipino contractor) was granted\na 30 year franchise to operate, construct and maintain toll facilities in the North and\nSouth Luzon expressways.\n\nIn 1983, the predominantly government-owned successor to CDCP2 PNCC, was granted a\n30-year  franchise  to  construct  and  operate  a  tolled  expressway  linking  the  North  and  South\nExpressways. The franchise also gave it \u201cthe right, privilege and authority to construct, maintain\nand operate any and all such extensions, linkages or stretches from any of these expressways.\u201d\n\nA first BOT law was passed in 1990 and a second \u201cthe Amended BOT Law\u201d (Republic Act\n7718) in 19943 Clear and comprehensive implementing rules and regulations accompanied the\nsecond law. Figure A1.1 summarizes the process.\n\n2 CDCP  suffered  severe  financial  difficulties  and  was  rescued  by  several  government  agencies.  Today  the  successor\n\nPNCC is 90 percent publicly-owned by these agencies.\n\n3 An Act amending sections of Republic Act 6957 entitled \u2018An Act Authorising the Financing, Construction, Operation\n\nand Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector, and for Other Purposes\u2019.\n\n\fFigure A1 .1: Philippines - The Public Bidding Process Under the BOT Law\n\nPrivate  Sector\n\n     Government\n\n  Time  Frame\n\nAppendix 1, page 3\n\nPROJECT ID &\nPREPARATION\n\nAPPROVAL BY\nAPPROPRIATE BODY\n\n30 WORKING DAYS (40 DAYS)\n\nDISAPPROVED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nSTOP OR IF WARRANTED\nPROPOSAL IS RECOMMENDED FOR\nNATIONAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING\n\nPrepares PQ Ducuments\n\nADVERTISEMENT/\nINVITATION TO\nPREQUALIFY (PQ) & BID\n\nADVERTISE ONCE EVERY WEEK FOR 3\nCONSECUTIVE WEEKS (21 DAYS)\n\nSubmits PQ Documents\n\nPREQUALIFICATION\nOF BIDDERS\n\nBIDDERS ARE GIVEN 30-45 DAYS TO SUBMIT\nPQ DOCUMENTS FROM LAST DATE OF ADVERTISEMENT\n\n30 DAYS TO REVIEW PQ DOCUMENTS FROM\nLAST DATE OF ADVERTISEMENT INCLUDING\nNOTIFICATION OF PREQUALIFIED BIDDERS\n\nPrepares Bid Documents\n\nSubmits Bid Proposal &\nBid Bond\n\nPRE-BID CONFERENCE/\nBID PREPARATION\n\n90 TO 120 DAYS TO PREPARE BID PROPOSAL\n\nRECEIPT AND\nOPENING OF BIDS\n\n1 DAY FOR BID SUBMISSION\n\nReceives notice of award\n\nSigns contract after compliance\nwith all conditions of the\ncontract/Posts\nPerformance Bond\n\nImplements Project\n\nEVALUATION OF BIDS\n(2 ENVELOPE SYSTEM)\n\n30 DAYS EACH FOR TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL BID\nEVALUATION (60 DAYS)\n\nCONTRACT AWARD\n\nDECISION TO AWARD - 30 DAYS FROM DATE OF\nCOMPLETION OF FINANCIAL EVALUATION\n\nSUBMISSION OF AGENCY TO ICC WITHIN 7 DAYS FROM DATE THE\nDECISION TO AWARD CONTRACT WAS MADE\n\nNEDA-ICC CLEARANCE\nOF CONTRACT\n\nICC TO ACT ON THE CONTRACT WITHIN 15 WORKING DAYS (20 DAYS)\nAGENCY SHALL APPROVE NOTICE OF AWARD (NOA) WITHIN 7\nDAYS AFTER ICC\u2019s CLEARANCE\n\nCONTRACT\nAPPROVAL\n\nISSUANCE OF NOTICE OF AWARD TO WINNING BIDDER SHALL BE 7 DAYS\nFROM DATE OF APPROVAL OF NOA\n\nCONTRACT EXECUTION SHOULD BE WITHIN 7 DAYS FROM RECEIPT OF\n(NOA)/ APPROVAL OF CONTRACT SHALL BE WITHIN 15 DAYS FROM\nCOMPLIANCE WITH ALL CONDITIONS/FOR CONTRACT AWARD\n\nCONTRACT\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nFRANCHISE SHALL BE AUTOMATICALLY GRANTED.

In this event the original proponent has the right to match the competing\nprice, in which case he proceeds with implementation.\n\nTRB issues a tolling certificate before approval is given. DPWH is then responsible\nfor implementation issues.\n\nIn 1995, a BOT center was established under the Office of the President, with the United\nStates Agency for International Development funding assistance to fast-track the BOT process.\nThis is small (25 staff in total, with 5 consultants on average), and focuses on:\n\n\u2022 Assisting line agencies prepare projects - to the BOT Units in line agencies such as\n\nDPWH.\n\n\u2022 Marketing projects internationally to potential investors.\n\n\u2022 Assisting them to negotiate with bidders by providing specialist expertise.\n\n\u2022\n\nIntroducing changes to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the BOT Law.\n\nA corresponding BOT Unit has also been established within DPWH to take the lead in the\n\nroads sector.\n\nTRB is required to approve toll rates from competitive bids (although approval ought to be\n\nautomatic in this case), to negotiate toll rates with joint ventures after holding public hearings,\n\n4\n\nThe  NEDA-ICC  has  Cabinet-level  attendance,  and  the  following  representation  and  associated  roles:  NEDA  chair,\nDPWH  the  line  agency,  Ministry  of  Finance  MOF  involved  only  if  government  guarantees  are  sought,  DBM  -allocates\ncounterpart  funding,  e.g.,  for  land  acquisition.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 5\n\nto approve toll increases also after public hearings, and to oversee construction/implementation of\njoint-venture projects. The President holds final decision-making power however and can reverse\nTRB decisions to increase rates. TRB has more than 100 staff. However between 1983 and 1996\nthere were no toll increases at all.\n\nAll  projects  are  required  to  have  an  Environmental  Impact  Assessment,  which  is  to  be\napproved by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. This process does sometimes\ninfluence the project definition. Relocation and resettlement issues are a particularly big problem\nfor major projects in the Philippines, and this is particularly true in Metro Manila.\n\n3.\n\nProject  Identification\n\nAll the identified expressways are in the Greater Capital Area \u2014 an area within 100kms of\n\nMetro Manila, either in the city, or on the radial intercity roads emanating from it.\n\nHence, there is a development plan but it does not yet have a major influence on land use.\nThere is a transport strategy for the city but it does not yet have a mechanism for addressing the\nissues of priority for particular projects and project identification. This creates two common problems\nin practice:\n\n\u2022 Project identification often takes place in a network vacuum \u2014 this means that there is\na lack of provision for integration between roads and many strategically important linkages\nare missing from the network.5\n\n\u2022 Good  projects  are  pre-empted  by  the  development  of  others,  which  may  have  less\neconomic  merit.  For  example,  many  of  the  projects  in  Metro  Manila  are  for  new\nexpressways  along  radials  into  the  center  of  Manila.  Typically  this  prevents  the\nconstruction of good public transport connections in those corridors when in fact, the\npublic transport option might be more appropriate. Once developed, these projects have\na high opportunity cost since they frustrate future strategy.\n\n4. Results of the Process: Projects\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTable Al .1 summarizes the characteristics and status of BOT expressway projects in\nthe Philippines.\n\nThere are no BOT expressways operational at present.6\n\nFive are under construction: Skyway  [CITRA]; Manila-Cavite [Renong]; North Luzon\nExpressway [BENPRES]; South Luzon Expressway (SLE) [Hopewell]; Southern Tagalog\nArterial Road (STAR) [CITRA].\n\n\u2022 Of these one has been competitively bid. This was successful:\n\n- Evaluation was on the basis of the criterion: lowest toll rate. This simplicity assisted\n\nthe evaluation.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nThe  same  is  true  for  Mass  Rapid  Transit  (MRT)  project,  which  sometimes  conflict  with  proposed  expressways.\nThis  was  the  case at  the  time  of  the  visit  in  April  1998,  other  than  a  short  section  (8  km)  of  the  Subic  Expressway.\nSince then a short section of Skyway has opened.

After\nearly success in the power sector, implementation of expressways is taking place, with a\npipeline of identified projects. Strong political purpose has resulted in a BOT Law that has\nsecured substantial confidence in the investment community. This has been achieved in a\nrelatively short time \u2014 less than a decade.\n\nFigure A1.2: Philippines Expressways - Luzon\n\nFigure A1.3: Expressways - Metro Manila\n\nNLE EXTN. TO SN. FDO.

This has meant that priority projects are not always identified and\nthere has been inter-project and inter-agency conflict.\n\nThe need for privately-funded expressways is primarily driven by a small public investment\nbudget (\u2018there is no alternative\u2019). There has been no discussion of the use of tolling\nstrategy as a matter of transport policy to improve efficiency of resource allocation, to\npromote social equity etc.\n\nThe absence of investment in project preparation. Project preparation is important since\nit maximizes the participation of the private sector and allows project implementation to\nproceed  with  predictable  consequences.12 However,  in  the  Philippines,  Government\nhas often tended to be reactive, and little is yet done to prepare projects for private/\npublic implementation.\n\nThe failure to recognize the valid use of public support to secure the non-user benefits\nof expressways. The assumption is that expressways are profitable. Typically, however,\nexpressways are only profitable if they have access to an external revenue stream or\ngovernment support in one form or another.\n\nLocal government opposition to national government plans. This has been particularly\nproblematic for land acquisition.\n\n\u2022 An absence of competition in contract award. In the case of the PNCC and PEA joint\nventure projects, there is no competitive bidding. In the case of unsolicited bids under\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n10 Including PNCC and PEA (Filipino joint venture partners), CITRA (Indonesia) and STRADEC (Indonesia) and Renong (Malaysia),\nHopewell  (Hong  Kong,China),  Kumagai  Gumi  (Japan),  Marubeni(Japan),  and  FBIDC  (Benpres)  and  New  San  Jose  Builders\n(Filipino).\n\n11 Meaning that its revenues will fund all its development, land, construction, and operating/maintenance costs,  together with profits\n\nacceptable  to  shareholders.\n\n12 Resulting in implementation to a predictable timescale, and ensuring that the project benefits are maximized.\n\n\fthe amended BOT Law, although price-matching is provided for, it is likely that its intent\nis being circumvented by project promoters.\n\nTable A1 .2: Pros and Cons of the Alternative Tracks for Investing\n\nAppendix 1, page 11\n\n      TRB Law (Joint ventures with PNCC, PEA)\n\nBOT  Law\n\nJV\u2019s  formed  under  franchises  awarded.  In  the  case  of\nPNCC these are constantly renewed as the network is\nextended\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nGovernment  provides  the  right-of-way\nBoard of Investments (BOl) incentives provided as\nper BOI Act\n\nNo  right-of-way  provided\nBOl incentives provided as per BOI Act\n\nContract  terms  negotiated  on  a  case-by-case  basis\n\nNo direct  government  guarantees,  support,  equity\n\nNo competition\n\nCompetition:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nbidding if solicited\nprice-test  if  unsolicited\n\nNo NEDA, Department of Finance involvement, and no\nNEDA-ICC role (unless government support is\nrequested).

Then,  concession  award\nis automatic\n\nThe Implementing Rules and Regulations are\ncurrently  being  reviewed  to  improve  the  process\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTariffs are not defined as a matter of policy; instead they are the outcome of the bidding\nprocess,  and  vary  from  project  to  project.  The  negotiated  tariff  escalation  formulae\nsimilarly vary.\n\nThe regulatory agency TRB, is in substantial conflict with DPWH and also project\nconcessionaires. This is in spite of the fact that the BOT Law transferred TRB to\nDPWH.  This  is  partly  a  matter  of  jurisdiction  (the  focus  of  technical  regulation\nactivities) and partly of personalities and history. It is a serious problem, frustrating\nthe process.\n\n\u2022 Government cannot provide guarantees under the unsolicited bidding route, meaning\nthat it cannot make payments direct to banks. But if the payment is via the private sector\ninterest it seems this circumvents the intent of the rule.\n\nMany of these issues are recognized in Government, and steps are in place to remedy\n\nthem, thus further improving the process:\n\nThe just-completed major thrust of TA 2487-PHI: Philippine Transport Strategy Study\nwas to secure private sector participation in the public interest.\n\nThe current Bank TA 2968-PHI: Transport Infrastructure and Capacity Development\nProject  is  assisting  Government  in  this  area,  and  identifying  a  possible  loan  to\nprovide ongoing support.\n\nImprovements  to  the  BOT  process  are  being  considered  by  NEDA-ICC,  with  inputs\nfrom BOT Center. There is, however, a resistance to reducing the autonomy of individual\nagencies, and no great expectation that there will be a rapid reversion to competitive\nbidding under the BOT Law.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 12\n\nInevitably government had to provide strong incentives to attract investors in the early days.\nThis has now been done. Once achieved there is concern that the balance of risks and rewards, if\nleft unchanged, may act against the public interest. Today there is a perceived need for the pendulum\nto swing back, focusing on the public interest. Pragmatism combined with continuous monitoring\nand recognition of this public interest provide a promising basis for the future development of policy.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 13\n\nB.\n\nMalaysia\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe key features of the Malaysian experience are:\n\nThe resounding success of the first project \u2014 the North-South Expressway (NSE).\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 A large number of projects both completed and in the pipeline.\nLimited Government involvement in project identification.\n\u2022\nThe absence of transparent legal frameworks for private sector involvement.\n\u2022\nThe heavy involvement of domestic Banks.\n\u2022\nThe complication of multiple tolling technologies.\n\u2022\nFinancial difficulties for concessionaires, and hence Government, as the economy has\n\u2022\nfaltered in the late 1990s.\n\nKey to the Malaysian expressway experience is the first project in the sector: the NSE. This\nproject has influenced everything else. The road had originally been designed as a public sector\nproject and Government built the first third (335kms). In the mid-80s, the project was restructured\nas a BOT expressway. The existing road was transferred to PLUS,13 who were also given tolling\nrights over the whole road. Hence, during construction of the remainder of the road, between 1988\nand 1994, PLUS had a revenue stream from the first section. The whole project has had a huge,\npositive impact upon the economic and social geography of Malaysia, and has attracted rapidly\ngrowing traffic. It has had a profound impact on future BOT projects.\n\nIs the NSE profitable? Undoubtedly, it is for the project company. However, had it been a\n\nstand-alone project without the Government assets and their revenue stream, it would not be.\n\nMalaysian expressway development has happened over a relatively short time (the last ten\nyears). The results of the program are only now becoming clear. This concentrated period of project\ndevelopment has allowed no time in which to learn the lessons of experience. Financial problems\nfor some of the projects are now contributing to the shock waves in the economy. Many of the\nprojects relied on the property market for additional revenues and as that market weakens the\nknock on effects for expressways have become clear. Almost all of the projects now require some\nGovernment support.\n\nHow has this situation developed?\n\n\u2022 Contractor-led consortia have usually made large construction profits. (These are often\nsecured by appointing fixed-price sub-contracts to smaller companies.) This has been\nthe motivation of virtually all the players, Government and private sector. Hence, the\nconsortia have had little incentive to consider long run financial viability.\nThere has been no framework of transport policy, or national transport strategy. The\nresult has been that:\n\n\u2022\n\nThere is no basis to reject any proposal.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nProjects have been developed in isolation from their network consequences.\n\n13\n\n  Part of the Renong Group.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 14\n\n- Concessionaires have had little interest in the economic, environmental or social impacts\n\nof their project.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe Economic Planning Unit (EPU), which is part of the Prime Minister\u2019s office, controls\nthe process, rather than the Highway Planning Unit whose brief is restricted to government\nprojects. Hence the government has not always:\n\n- Ensured that each project is justified and a priority.\n\n- Ensured that the benefits of competition are realized. The typical route for developers\nis via the Prime Minister and a letter of intent and exclusivity from the EPU. This has\nruled out competition before the feasibility study stage.\n\n- Enforced the concession agreement in the public interest.\n\n\u2022 Where there has been competition for a well-prepared project it has been successful\n\u2014 attracting private sector interest, innovation and in all probability providing good value-\nfor-money. The key example of this was the Shah Alam Expressway project, which was\ntendered in 1991. Its concept had been developed by JBIC and subject to considerable\npreparation. The bidding period was extended three times from the initial three months,\nallowing bidders to develop innovative concepts. Gamuda were the winning bidder. Their\nbids saved MRl5Omn by avoiding filling in a mining pond -which meant that there was\nno need for a Government soft loan, changed the staging and took innovative funding\nadvice from Schroders. However this was unusual. For both the Kuala Lumpur (KL)\nNorth-East  Expressway  and  the  East  Coast  Expressway  there  were  three  groups\nbidding, and the government asked them to combine, removing effective competition. In\nthe  case  of  the  East  Coast  Expressway  there  has  been  no  progress  because  of\ndifferences between the three.\n\nThere is no BOT Law providing the legislative basis for the system and little transparency\nin the system of project identification and procurement.\n\n\u2022 All debt tends to be domestic, and the banks, in practice, take no risk. The government\nguarantees the loans through the concession agreements. Thus it is the government\nthat takes the majority of the risk. The current financial crisis has highlighted the problems\nof this contingent liability for the government.\n\nThe project sponsors are often big infrastructure groups who may also have interests in\nthe banks. This substantially increases risk and reduces transparency.\n\nThe typical debt: equity ratios are 4:1. This suggests that the banks should be carrying\nmajor  risk,  but  in  practice  because  of  government  support  through  the  concession\nagreement, they are not. Therefore, they carry out little due-diligence work before deciding\nto invest.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022 One interesting aspect of this experience is (in marked contrast to most countries) the\nability of the private sector to implement projects which they identify. The private sector:\n\nAppendix 1, page 15\n\nIdentifies most projects\n\n- Plans the projects.\n-\n- Designs\n-\n- Operates.\n\nImplements.\n\n2 Legislative and Institutional Framework\n\nThere is no BOT law. Rather, the system has usually operated in the following way:\n\n\u2022 A project is developed to a pre-feasibility level by a private group, who request a letter of\nexclusivity from EPU to develop the project EPU reviews the project concept and if the\nproject is approved, a letter of exclusivity is issued\n\n\u2022\n\nThe project is subject to full feasibility study, and a Privatization Proposal developed.\nThis is submitted to EPU for formal review EPU usually convenes a Technical and a\nFinancial Evaluation Committee, involving the appropriate line agencies.\n\n\u2022 Concessionaires may proceed to detailed design in expectation of approval, in\n\nparallel with negotiation of the concession agreement. This may take 3-9 months.\n\nIt typically costs RM 3 million-RM 4 million (US$1 million) to complete this process.\n\nDepartment of the Environment approval is required for an Environmental Impact Assess-\nment and in some cases this has influenced projects. Relocation and particularly squatters are\noften a particular problem and here the private sector has sometimes assisted the Government.\nFor example, PLUS seconded staff to assist with land acquisition for the NSE.\n\nA key issue facing the private sector promotion of projects which are not subject to govern-\nment  preparation,  is  that  there  is  no  basis  on  which  to  compare  the  projects,  as  each  bid  has\ndifferent characteristics. Other issues arise from the competing technologies among the different\ndevelopers. For example, Renong uses the infra-red tolling technology, and Gamuda the micro-\nwave system.\n\nMany different government agencies are involved in the process. The Malaysian Highways\nAuthority signs the concession agreement, and is responsible for technical regulation; while eco-\nnomic regulation is the remit of EPU and the Cabinet \u2014 who need to approve toll increases (even\nwhen their basis may be defined unambiguously in the concession agreement).\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 16\n\nEPU has defined some clear policies for the sector:\n\n\u2022\n\nThere should always be a parallel free road.\n\n\u2022 Public transport should be encouraged to use expressways. Thus tariffs on buses are\n\nlower than for cars. This is an innovative approach to promoting social equity.\n\n\u2022 Motorcycles have separate tracks, engineered into the design, along the Federal Road\n1. This reflects the large number of motorcycles, which are used by low/middle income\npeople and also contribute to social equity.\n\nTariffs are derived from the concessionaires bid and negotiations, based on EPU\u2019s view\nof an acceptable rate of return (currently 15 percent IRA). They are therefore based upon the\nneed to repay the cost, rather than on transport policy objectives. Tolls are all per - kilometer\nbased. NSE tariffs have, in practice, set the benchmark and they were guaranteed an increase of\n6 percent per annum resulting in a real increase when inflation was low. Toll rates for taxis and\nbuses do not rise. Current car tariffs are 10.5 sen/km (US2.8 cents/km). Recently government\nrefused  the  application  for  an  \u2018automatic\u2019  6  percent  increase.  This  came  at  a  difficult  time\neconomically - with widespread resistance to toll increases, and discussions are ongoing about\ncompensation.\n\nThe Shah Alam Expressway has the following tolls:\n\n\u2022 RM 1/car at each of the tollbooths on the 17km open section.\n\u2022 RM 1/car to be charged at the single tollbooth on the 18km extension.\n\u2022\n\nTolls increase to RM1.20 in January 1999 and RM1.60 in 2001 \u2013  resulting in a guaranteed\nincrease of 6 percent every 2 years.\n\n\u2022 Medium  goods  vehicles  and  heavy  goods  vehicles  are  charged  RM1  .5  and  RM2\n\nrespectively at each tollbooth (and RM2 and RM3 on the KL-Karak section).\n\n\u2022 Buses are charged 75 sen and taxis 50 sen at each toll barrier.\n\nIn the latest concession agreements the government is moving towards a system of:\n\n\u2022 Restricting increases to every 5 years.\n\u2022 Only allowing an increase when revenues are no higher than forecast at the time of the\nconcession agreement. This is part of government\u2019s effort to tilt the balance of reward\nback towards the government.\n\n3. Project Identification\n\nA national roads master plan was developed in the early 1980\u2019s and Kuala Lumpur transport\nstudy undertaken in the mid 1980\u2019s, and updated under JBIC funding in 1998. However, these plans\ndo not provide a strategy for project identification and prioritization. (The current KL master plan\ndoes not include a recommended roads strategy).\n\nMoreover, the responsible KL agency (DBKL) while invited to comment on project proposals,\nhas little influence and sometimes opposes projects which are subsequently given approval from\nthe national Government.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 17\n\nIn summary, government has looked to the private sector to identify projects and the private\n\nsector has responded with enthusiasm.\n\n4.

But recently the system has shown signs of strain. Key points to note:\n\n\u2022 Malaysia has achieved much in terms of completed projects, with more under construction\n\nand in the pipeline.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 21\n\n\u2022 Malaysia\u2019s private sector has shown - maybe uniquely, that it can \u2018make projects happen\u2019.\nThis is a substantial achievement. It is because of: (i) very strong commitment from the\ntop that this will happen; and (ii) large incentives to the private sector to carry out functions\nnormally carried out by government.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe Government has often not benefited from competition, nor has the investment\nbeen without substantial government support. The private sector has usually obtained\nhigh  profits  and  avoided  carrying  significant  risk.  It  is  the  public  sector  that  has\ncarried most of the risk, and has a huge contingent liability - which is now being\nrealized.\n\nThere has been much innovation in projects and approaches, and a broad, adaptable\nindustry has been developed. Unfortunately the benefits of this experience are unlikely\nto be exportable on a significant scale.\n\nThere  has  been  little  economic  or  social  evaluation  of  the  program  since  privatized\nprojects are assumed to be in the public good and there has been little or no public\nparticipation.\n\n\u2022 Malaysia\u2019s privatization has been implemented under strong determination to benefit\nBumiputras, by creating large entrepreneurial conglomerates. The major beneficiaries\nhave been the project developers and the banks. The former have shown their ability to\ndevelop  innovative  project  concepts,  quickly  and  to  make  construction  profits  with\nfinancial innovation.\n\nThere has been little risk taking from banks, who have been protected by Government\nguarantee.  Also,  banks  may  be  linked  to  the  project  developers,  or  acting  under\ngovernment influence. The lack of risk has meant that the banks have often failed to\ncarry out appropriate due diligence.\n\n\u2022 Government has given support to assist project viability: land, soft loans \u2014 repayable\nafter commercial debt is repaid creating long-term finance, and traffic guarantees (on\nthe NSE).\n\n\u2022 Government does not provide foreign exchange guarantees, which have not been an\nissue  because  virtually  all  debt  has  been  domestic.  Until  recently,  foreign  equity\ninvestment has not been allowed. Under liquidity problems this is happening, requiring\napproval on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u2022\n\nThere is no transparent BOT or concessioning process, no BOT Law and no published\nprocedures.\n\n\u2022 Profits for the project developers come from construction and sometimes latterly from\nlisting  the  project  on  the  KL  Stock  Exchange.  This  can  be  done  for  a  large  project\n(greater than RM500 million) before construction, based on projections. GAMUDA have\ndone this - the concept is that a first listing can be the vehicle for raising subsequent\nequity by rights issues or sale.\n\n\u2022 However, toll roads rarely make money without strong government support (in kind,\ninvestments and/or guarantees). This is a clear conclusion from this case study. It is\nestimated that only 2-3 out of the first 9 operational projects are profitable without such\nGovernment support.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 22\n\nA conclusion may be that \u2014 as for Mexico \u2014 Malaysia has suffered from developing its\nnetwork  too  quickly.  It  is  only  recently,  when  the  main  batch  of  projects  started  opening,  that\nGovernment realized the scale of their contingent liability.\n\nThis realization together with the impact of the economic crisis is now leading to change.\nMOF is now taking a more central role because of the need to fund the government liabilities. Bank\nNegara has not classified toll roads as priority projects but existing projects are being supported\nthrough restructuring of developers\u2019 debts. One key lesson has been that land and development\nprofits have provided an unsafe basis for project funding.\n\nBoth Government and the private sector see the need for assistance by ADB and other\nmulti-lateral lending institutions, and programs are being developed to provide that assistance. A\nnew chapter in Malaysian road privatization may be beginning.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 23\n\nC.\n\nThailand\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe key features of the Thai experience are:\n\nThe dominance of Bangkok.\nInstitutional conflicts and lack of government planning.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Process difficulties, and a changing process.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe difficulty of terminating concession agreements that are not implemented.\nFinancial difficulties for concessionaires, and thereby for Government, as the economy\nhas faltered in the late 1990\u2019s.\n\nAll  of  Thailand\u2019s  existing  expressways  are  in  the  Bangkok  area,  or  on  radial  routes\nconnecting  to  Bangkok.  The  conditions  for  successful  expressways  exist  -  high  traffic  flows,\nsevere  traffic  congestion,  a  poorly  developed  existing  road  network  and  relatively  high  and\nincreasing values of time.\n\nToday a network of expressways has been developed. The process of development has\nbeen difficult, with at least one project failing (Hopewell) and two others experiencing major contractual\nproblems \u2014 Second Stage Expressway and Don Muang Tollway.\n\nThe network has developed in phases, with the participation of several different government\nagencies. In the late 1970\u2019s, government developed the First-Stage Expressway System. In the\nlate 1980\u2019s government policy was \u2018private sector first\u2019 - and individual government agencies were\nencouraged to contract BOT expressway and mass transit projects. The Second Stage Expressway,\nDon  Muang  Tollway,  and  Hopewell  were  the  first  results;  with  other  projects  planned  as  BOT\nconcessions. These were not co-ordinated and almost all major corridors had megaprojects which\nconflicted with one another, often using the same airspace. The problems created at that time, still\ncause severe problems today.\n\nDuring the early 1990\u2019s, three significant events took place:\n\n\u2022\n\nIn 1993, the Anand Government introduced a law requiring compensation be paid for\nland,  at  market  rates.  This  resulted  in  a  huge  increase  in  the  Government  cost  of\nmegaprojects, with two results:\n\n- Conflict on the Second Stage Expressway leading to a collapse of the original\nshareholding in BECL umagai Gumi and foreign lenders were replaced by\nExpressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA) and Thai lenders].\nThis undermined the confidence of the international community that the\nGovernment could administer a legally-binding concession agreement.\n\n-\n\nIncreasing institutional conflict between the two main agencies in the sector: ETA\nand the Department of Highways (DOH). Increasing land prices forced ETA to adopt\nexisting road alignments, to minimize land take. DOH own the rights-of-way of several\nroads and consider they should develop them. This remains a serious problem with\nthe agencies having sometimes developed \u2018competing\u2019 projects, creating difficulties\nand uncertainties.\n\n\u2022 A 1993 Royal Act created the current framework for private sector participation. This\nsought to ensure that government agencies did not, in future, unilaterally contract BOT\nconcession agreements; it applied to all large (>1 billion baht) projects.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 24\n\n\u2022 About the same time the Cabinet decided that within a 25 square kilometer area of\ncentral Bangkok, all transit lines should be underground. After appeal, 2 of the 3 transit\nschemes  with  concession  agreements  were  allowed  to  remain  elevated.  Although\nexpressways were not involved, the process caused uncertainty and difficulty given the\nnetwork of actual and proposed expressways and MRT lines.\n\nThe Thai economic crisis began in mid 1997. The chaotic process by which BOT projects\nhave developed may have been a contributory cause of that crisis. ADB15 is assisting the Thai\nGovernment to improve the current process.\n\n2.\n\nLegislative and Institutional Framework\n\nThere  is  no  BOT  Law  and  the  existing  BOT  process  is  not  yet  regarded  as  fully\n\ntransparent.\n\nThe main Government agencies and their responsibilities are:16\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance:  provides  government  support  (investment,  guarantees)  for\nprojects.\n\n\u2022 National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB): is under the Office of the\nPrime Minister and responsible for strategic infrastructure planning, but with no veto\nover projects.\n\n\u2022 DOH is under the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is responsible for\n\nnational highways.\n\n\u2022 ETA: is a state enterprise under the Ministry of Interior, responsible for new expressways.\n\n\u2022 Bangkok Metropolitan Administration: is responsible for metropolitan roads in Bangkok.\n\n\u2022 Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment: requires environmental impact\n\nassessments  for  major  projects.\n\nThere is a history of institutional conflict, with decisions often being resolved at Cabinet\nlevel. ETA and DOH have separately and independently prepared expressway programs without\nco-ordination.  It  is  around  the  periphery  of  Bangkok  that  the  major  conflicts  arise  with  the  first\nagency to construct tending to force a delay or change the plans of the other agency. ETA has not\nbeen involved outside the Bangkok region.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nTA  2353-THA: Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure Projects.\nIn  addition,  the  Public  Works  Department  construct  some  roads:  bridges  and  approach  roads  in  Bangkok,  secondary  roads\noutside; but it cannot collect tolls.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 25\n\nDOH  has  the  authority  to  develop  tolled  expressways,  under  the  recently  amended\nHighway Concession Act. They have produced a national expressway network,17 which has the\nfollowing features:\n\nIt is national in scope - see Figure Al .5 and includes the Bangkok Region.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nIt is ambitious and is to be implemented over 20 years.\n\nIt comprises 4,l50kms of expressways.\n\nIts cost is estimated in 1997 prices as US$13.4 billion.\n\nIt is to be implemented in its entirety as BOT concessions, with toll revenues used to\nfund  the  network.  It  is  expected  that  this  will  be  feasible  without  a  massive\ngovernment  commitment.\n\nThe first 5-year program was approved by Cabinet in April 1997, and comprised:\n\n11  motorway  projects,  852  kms  in  length,  costing  Bt159  billion  (US$4.2\nbillion@Bt38=$l).\n\nseven of which have been subject to feasibility study.\n\ntwo of which were considered to be ready for private sector participation.\n\nNo procurement strategy was announced for the new program. In the past, the Government\nhas provided guarantees on an ad hoc basis, depending on the project and the sponsors. This has\nmade it difficult for bidders, who may have had unrealistic expectations. In some cases evaluation\nhas taken place and the decision submitted to Cabinet for approval only to find that the Cabinet\nhave required the whole process to start again. Substantial delay and frustration has sometimes\nbeen the result.\n\nProjects developed under the Highway Concession Act will have:\n\n\u2022 A concession period of between 25 and 30 years, based on the expected financial rate\n\nof return.\n\n\u2022 A \u2018closed\u2019 toll system with specified toll rates:\n\n- Cars/4 wheels, 1 Bt/km, but 30 Bt minimum\n\n- Vehicles up to 6 wheels, 1 .6BtIkm, but 50Bt minimum.\n\n- Vehicles > 6 wheels, 2.3Bt/km, but 70Bt minimum.\n\n\u2022\n\nThere is no clear policy on toll rate increases, which is of concern to investors: \u2018the\nconcessionaire may from time to time request to adjust the toll rates so that they are\nfair to the company in light of changes in the economic situation\u2019.\n\n\u2022 Government support is to be considered at negotiation stage and assistance for land\n\nacquisition is promised. This too has undermined investor confidence.\n\n17\n\n  Proposed Inter-City Motorway Projects in the Kingdom of Thailand for Privatisation\u2019, by DOH, May 1998.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 26\n\nAfter the early contracts, in which individual agencies signed contracts sometimes with no\ncompetition, e.g., Hopewell, most projects have involved competition. The procurement, however,\nhas  not  always  been  transparent,  with  charges  of  corruption  sometimes  cited  as  a  reason  for\ncontract award; and this has reinforced institutional conflict.\n\n3.\n\nProject  Identification\n\nThailand is recognized as having particularly difficult institutional problems in the transport\nsector. This is particularly so in the Bangkok region. There appears to be no effective mechanism\nfor coordinating action, other than the Cabinet.\n\nThere  has  been  no  formal  process  for  project  identification.  Symptoms  of  this  problem\n\ninclude the following:\n\n\u2022 NESDB  produce  plans  for  the  sector,  but  the  agencies  do  not  abide  by  these,  and\n\nsometimes act in conflict with them.\n\n\u2022 Projects contracted in the early 1990\u2019s often appeared to contravene the public interest,\nbut serve institutional objectives. Thus, in the northern corridor 3 MRT projects and 3\nexpressways were contracted. While the national Seventh Plan argued against this,\nthe  projects  were  unaffected,  until  the  recent  demise  of  Hopewell,  which  has  left  a\nlegacy of problems.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThere has been little effective project co-ordination: the first project constructed \u2018wins\u2019\nin  the  battle  for  alignment.  This  affects  the  MRT  system  adversely,  as  well  as  the\nexpressways, when ETA and DOH have developed \u2018competing\u2019 projects in the same\ncorridor.\n\nThe projects are sometimes not optimized. MRT systems are required to be underground\n\u2014 presumably because of their visual impact \u2014 yet expressways, which are usually\nconsidered intrusive (since they are so much wider) continue to be built through the\nmiddle of the city.\n\nThe  concentration  of  megaprojects  down  the  main  corridors  fails  to  tackle  one  of\nBangkok\u2019s central problems - a poorly developed primary road network. This results in\nmassive megablocks undeveloped because they are inaccessible except via narrow,\nunconnected lanes (sois). Instead of opening up new corridors, the megaprojects are\nmostly perpetuating them. The increase in compensation payments to market rates\nhas markedly increased this tendency, encouraging Government to avoid costly land\nacquisition in favor of using existing rights-of-way.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 27\n\n4.\n\nResults of the Process: Projects\n\nTable Al .4 and Figures Al .5 and Al .6 summarize the extent, characteristics and status of\n\nBOT expressway projects in Thailand:\n\n\u2022\n\nThere are four BOT expressways operational at present.\n\n\u2022 Another four are under construction.\n\n\u2022 A substantial pipeline is planned, including a national expressway system.\n\nTable A1.4: Thailand: BOT Expressway Projects\n\n          Proje                             Status\n\nProject\n\n                         Contract\n\n              Cost\n             US$bn18\n\nOperational\nFirst Stage\nExpressway  System\n\nOpen 1987\n\n27 km\n\nImplemented by ETA (Government project)\n\nSecond Stage\nExpressway  System\n\nOpen 1993-\n  1996\n\n1.1\n\n39km\n\nETA/BECL\nBTO  30  years  from  contract  award.\nContractual problems on opening - foreign\npartners replaced by Thai\nIncludes  60%  of  First  Stage  Expressway\nrevenue  stream\nProblems of land acquisition have delayed\npart of the project\n\nDon Muang Tollway\n\n1995-97\n\n0.3\n\n15 km\nlinks\nairport to\ndowntown\n19 km\n\n1994-97\n\n0.85\n\n1997-1999\n\n0.3\n\n83km\n\nGovernment (DOH) implementation under\nJBIC loan.

Consultant Freeman Fox, Kumagai Gumi, and CH Karnchang identified this\nas  a  promising  BOT  opportunity,  and  carried  out  the  project  development  purposefully.  They\nconcluded that Government support would be necessary. An unsolicited bid (from BECL) was then\nmade to ETA. It proposed that:\n\n\u2022\n\nThe project should be tendered, but to a tight timetable, limiting the effective competition.\n\n\u2022 A definite completion period, providing that in return ETA committed to a timetable for\nmaking land available for construction. If this date was not met, BECL would share\nequally in the revenues from the Government-operated First-Stage Expressway System,\nand continue to do so on an agreed basis.\n\nThe  bid-to-award  process  took  18  months  and  the  construction  was  implemented\npurposefully. On the point of opening, however, a dispute arose, with ETA insisting that it should\ncollect  the  tolls.  The  outcome  was  that  foreign  investors  were  replaced  by  Thai  investors.\nSubsequently there have been problems of toll increases not being awarded when justified under\nthe contract, but, by and large, these have taken place.\n\nLand acquisition, while substantially accomplished, has proved intractable for section D\n\n(the road was to be built in sections), and this is unlikely to be completed.\n\nThe Second Stage Expressway tariff has set the precedent for other projects and is currently\n\n30 baht for cars. There is an electronic tolling system but it is little used.\n\nb.\n\nDon Muang Tollway\n\nUnder the agreement, Government was required to remove flyovers on the parallel road\nwhich competes with the tollroad, and the flyovers were instead to be re-constructed for orbital\nmovements. However, the Government delayed for more than two years and the Transport and\nCommunications Ministry would not allow toll increase (from 20 to 30 baht) until the flyovers were\ncompleted. The result was that the tollway collected only one-third of forecast revenues during that\nperiod. This lack of revenue meant that the sponsor was threatened with bankruptcy. Renegotiations\nled to Government compensation and an injection of Bt3 billion, giving Government a 40 percent\nstake  in  the  concession  company.  From  being  a  private  project  it  has  now  become  a  quasi-\ngovernment one.\n\nThe  Don  Muang  Tollway  currently  charges  20  baht  for  cars  and  30  baht  for  6-axle\n\nvehicles.\n\nc.\n\nHopewell\n\nThe contract was awarded in 1990 by SRT/Ministry of Transport and Communications. It\ncalled for an integrated structure with grade-separated SRT railway tracks, an MRT system and an\nexpressway on the top level - extending a total of 60 kms to the north and east of Bangkok.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 32\n\nFunding was to be from land development profits and the tolled expressway. The project\nconflicted with parallel projects under implementation, and \u2018froze\u2019 many other projects, because it\nhad access to all the land and air-rights above SRT.\n\nThe crash in the property market (which started several years ago), and the latest economic\ncrisis have seriously compounded the problems created by locating three expressways in a single\ncorridor. After 8 years of ineffective implementation the government has terminated the concession.\nIt is now left with a significant problem (what to do with partly-constructed elevated structures), no\nsolution for SRT, and no implementation of MRT on what has always been one of the best MRT\nalignments in Bangkok. The way to tackle these issues is currently being investigated.\n\n6. Conclusions and Comments\n\nBangkok\u2019s expressways support one firm conclusion: they do not solve traffic congestion.\nToday there is a network of expressways which is well-used, but results in huge congestion, often\non the expressways, and invariably when access to/from the expressways is required.\n\nOther lessons from Bangkok include the following:\n\n\u2022 A good procurement process is vital. In Bangkok, the absence of this has produced\nmassive delays, losses for participating private sector companies, and poor results.\n\nIn spite of expectations, expressways are often unprofitable. Second Stage Expressway\nand Don Muang Tollway - two apparently very good projects - have both required major\nGovernment investment.\n\nLand profits are unsafe as a basis for funding - the abandonment of Hopewell is one\nexample.\n\n\u2022 Planning is necessary. Government agencies undertook identification in Bangkok, but\nthere was little co-ordination between them. The conflicts have caused major problems.\n\nLetting concessions has a high opportunity cost when they are not implemented. They\nhave proved very difficult to terminate, even when they directly conflict with each other.\nWhen the networks of expressways and MRT projects are large, this creates a straight\njacket, severely constraining Government action.\n\nInvestors,  both  foreign  and  domestic,  have  often  been  deterred  from  bidding  by  a\ncombination of a perception of lack of transparency and corruption in contract award,\nand an inability to administer legally-binding contracts.\n\nLand  costs  have  made  projects  more  and  more  costly  to  government  -  partly  as  a\nresult of increasing prices, and partly as a result of paying proper compensation. This\nmakes projects increasingly difficult to justify, and reinforces the need for prioritization.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  recent  crisis  has  lead  ETA  to  focus  on  completion  of  ongoing  projects,  and  the\ndeferring of new projects. The crisis provides Government with a window of opportunity, which\nan ADB technical assistance grant is now addressing. It has recommended the following action,\nand discussions are ongoing with Government to comprehensively overhaul the concession\nprocess:\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 33\n\n\u2022 A statement of Government policy for private sector participation in infrastructure would\nclarify policy and identify/allocate risks to be borne by government and the private sector\non a mandatory compliance basis.\n\n\u2022 Require  mandatory  compliance  with  the  NESDB  medium/long-term  plans  and  the\nnational 5-Year Plan by all government agencies.

This would involve establishing a central coordinating\ngroup within the MOF to spearhead the changes.\n\n\u2022 Review long-term domestic capital market needs.\n\n\u2022 Prepare standard bidding and contract documents and procedures for all government\n\nagencies.\n\n\u2022 Provide technical support to Government agencies, and require that expert technical\nassistance be secured for the identification, procurement, and evaluation processes\nfor individual projects.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 34\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe key features of the Hong Kong, China experience are:\n\nThe effectiveness of government planning.\nThe effectiveness of a transparent bidding processes.\nThe need for a tariff policy on government-tolled facilities.\nThe use of different mechanisms for private sector involvement.\nThe problems of competition in tolling technologies.\nInnovatory mechanisms for establishing the toll rate.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Under-use of costly transport infrastructure.\n\nFor  Hong  Kong,  China,  the  core  objectives  of  private  funding  have  been  to  release\nGovernment resources for other purposes, and early implementation. Implementation is swifter\nunder  private  management  than  Government,  and  hence  road  users  benefit  from  the  new\ninfrastructure sooner.\n\nAll projects to date have been bid on the basis that under the terms of the bid toll and\nancillary  revenues  will  create  profitable  projects.  There  has  been  no  consideration  of  negative\nconcessions \u2014 in which the government explicitly provides support for unprofitable but economically\nimportant roads.\n\nUnlike the rest of Asia, Hong Kong, China has not only involved the private sector in BOT\nprojects, but also in management contracts for Government tunnels, and latterly in a maintenance\nmanagement contract for the Tsing Ma Control Area.\n\n2.\n\nLegislative, Institutional and Financial Framework\n\nHong Kong, China has \u2018learned by doing\u2019. Its first BOT project was opened in 1972, with\nsubsequent  projects  in  1989,  1991,  1997,  and  1998.  This  has  allowed  the  BOT  process  to  be\ncontinuously improved.\n\nThe involvement of the private sector in infrastructure provision is not forced by funding\nimperatives,  and  the  case  for  PSP  is  less  compelling  than  it  might  be,  given  the  absence  of\ninefficiency of the bureaucracy. Rather, the Hong Kong, China view is that the private sector should\nbe used where it can best deliver services and that where this is not possible, Government should\nbe  made  more  efficient  -  e.g.,  through  creating  government  corporations.  This  is  decided\npragmatically. The railways are mostly corporations, which raise private finance. The airport has\nalso been corporatized. Power, telecoms, and ports have all been longestablished private sector\nactivities and recently BOT projects have been developed for refuse transfer stations, landfill sites,\nand chemical waste treatment.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 35\n\nIn the roads sector the government has followed two different approaches to PSP:\n\n\u2022 Management contracts.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nFor tunnels (e.g., Lion Rock, Aberdeen). Tenders have been on the basis of what\nbidders are willing to accept ($/vehicle) over a four or five year franchise period to\noperate the toll facilities on behalf of Government, maintain the facility and control\ntraffic. Equipment has been provided by the Government. The resulting bids have all\ncome in below Government\u2019s estimates.\n\nFor the Tsing Ma Control Area (the Airport Corridor), where a fixed price lump-sum\ncontract has been let in view of uncertainty over traffic. This is an innovative traffic\ncontrol project, developed for a single corridor.\n\nThe Cross Harbour Tunnel franchise expires in late 1999, when the tunnel reverts to\nGovernment. It then intends to let a manage, operate, and maintain concession for\n2 years, with the possibility of extension, and toll levels unchanged.\n\n\u2022 BOT  contracts.  Hong  Kong,  China  has  a  Legislative  Council  (Legco)  comprising  of\nelected  representatives  who  are  key  to  project  implementation  while  the  Executive\nCouncil (Exco) and civil servants undertake project development. This creates problems\nfor civil servants, with the need for much lobbying to get decisions through Legco.\n\na.\n\nTariff Policy\n\nThe Government has had no tariff policy. Bidders would propose the toll levels, and the\nGovernment would confirm an acceptable level during bid evaluation and negotiation. However, a\nnew system has now been introduced, following the Western Harbour Tunnel negotiations. This\nsystem  guarantees  that  tariffs  will  be  increased,  and  is  an  important  support  for  private  sector\ninterest in the process.\n\nUnder the old system, it has been difficult for concessionaires to obtain approval for a toll\nincrease. The original Cross Harbour Tunnel had a $5 toll (cars), then in 1984 a further $5 \u2018passage\ntax\u2019 was imposed. Since 1984, the toll has not been increased despite lobbying from the concession\ncompany. This is because the tunnel is very profitable and \u2018it provides the people with choice\u2019 (and\nhas become an almost un-tolled alternative).\n\nThe result is that both the Eastern and Western harbour tunnels have been adversely affected,\nthe latter in particular carrying traffic which is only a small proportion of its capacity. The Eastern\nHarbour Tunnel took the matter of its toll increases to arbitration, as allowed under the concession\nagreement. It won the case, but the uncertainty associated with this provided a major disincentive\nto potential concessionaires.\n\nThe  toll  differential  for  cars  is  HK$30-10-15,  for  the  WHT-CHT-EHT.  It  is  therefore  not\nsurprising  that  the  Cross  Harbour  Tunnel  (dual  2-lane)  attracts  the  vast  majority  of  traffic,  with\nabout 120,000 vehicle per day (vpd), compared with 35,000 in the Western Harbour Tunnel (dual 3-\nlane) and 80,000 vpd in the Eastern Harbour Tunnel (dual 3-lane). The Western Harbour Tunnel\ntraffic has been increased somewhat by petrol coupons and toll discounts.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 36\n\nThe new system now provided includes:\n\n\u2022 A schedule of defined tolls, and years when increases will take place, and the size of\n\n\u2022 A range (low-high) of allowable financial internal rates of return for the project (e.g., 15-\n\nthose increases.\n\n18 percent).\n\n\u2022 A  range  of  net  revenue  projections  over  the  concession  period  (revenues  minus\n\noperations costs minus interest payments).\n\n\u2022 A seat on the concession company Board for Government.\n\nEach year, the company is required to submit audited accounts and the resulting \u2018net revenue\u2019\nto the Government, to compare with the projections. When the franchisee\u2019s revenue is more than\nthe amount projected, the excess is placed in a Toll Stability Fund. Government has the right to use\nthis money to defer a toll increase which would otherwise fall due. When the franchisee\u2019s revenue\nis less than projected, the Government may use the fund to top up the franchisee\u2019s revenue to the\nminimum agreed level. If the balance of the fund is insufficient to do this, the franchisee may bring\nforward a toll increase, subject to vetting of accounts by the Government. If moneys remain at the\nend of the concession period, they revert to the government exchequer.\n\nThe result of this approach is to:\n\n\u2022 Reduce downside risk to the concessionaire who may receive revenue support and/or\n\nis allowed to bring forward toll increases, if the fund is cash-rich.\n\n\u2022 Provide upside cash for government.\n\nThe key issue reinforced by the existing economic turndown is still, however, the traffic in\nthe early years. If that is low, then there is no fund to support revenues, and the limit of the support\nto the concessionaire is to allow flexibility in tariff changes.\n\nThere remains concern that the existing process is leading to costly infrastructure being\n\nunder-utilized.\n\nb.\n\nThe  Bidding  Process\n\nThe Hong Kong, China bidding process is transparent and follows on from the Government\nfeasibility study and preliminary design. A detailed project brief and conforming design is produced.\nThe upcoming bidding is advertised and advised through consulates widely. The Government lays\ndown three imperatives:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nInvestors must build the facility to a fixed cost and within a fixed time.\nThe shareholders must guarantee revenue in the first 5 years.\nInvestors must fund their equity - and be joint-and-severally liable.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 37\n\nThe process then proceeds as follows:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nInterested parties collect the bidding documents for HK$1 million. There is no short-\nlisting procedure. Tenderers are typically given 4 months to submit their bids. These\nmust include the conforming design, but may include alternatives.\n\nThree  government  committees  (finance/administrative,  traffic/transport,  and  land/\nengineering) evaluate the bids, independently of each other, over a 4-week period. An\nindependent member of the anti-corruption force is in attendance at such meetings.\n\n\u2022 Bidders are given two opportunities to refine their bid, after clarification is sought by the\n\nGovernment where necessary.\n\nThe bidders are progressively narrowed down, the intention being to competitively\nnegotiate almost to a conclusion. The authority of Exco is sought before negotiations\nwith  1  or  2  bidders  commences,  and  again  to  confirm  the  terms  of  the  finally\nnegotiated bid.\n\nThe  bidders  are  required  to  submit  a  fixed  cost  and  fixed  implementation  time  to\noperation. This requires bidders to obtain fixed prices from their contractors, with back-\nto-back agreements. The result is to substantially remove cost and time risk for the\nconcessionaire, and all projects have opened early, with contractor and concessionaire\nsharing the excess income generated. Contractors have learned to accept this approach\nproviding there are no subsequent changes.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe key evaluation criterion is lowest tariff.\n\nThe  Government  has  had  access  to  a  pool  of  international  experts  in  the  technical,\nfinancing and legal disciplines, who have assisted the effective implementation of the BOT process\nmaterially.\n\nHong  Kong,  China  appears  to  be  different  from  other  countries  in  the  region  in  that  its\nconcessionaires are often not the major contractors. Originally the contractors led. The Government\nprefers concessionaires not to have contractor equity.\n\nWhat has changed the picture is not government guidance on the composition of bidding\n\nconsortia, but:\n\n\u2022 Contractors  do  not  now  have  the  funds  for  equity  investment.  This  was  the  case  -\nNishimatsu for example were prepared to take up virtually all the equity for Tate\u2019s Cairn,\nwhereas now they may be prepared to take 15 percent. The Japanese contractors are\nhurting badly due to the recession and to domestic problems.\n\n\u2022 Conversely, property developers do have cash to invest and some projects are linked to\nproperty development. The Route 3 project goes through massive land holdings of Sun\nHung Kai, the lead investor.\n\n\u2022 Maybe increased competition with the need to submit a keenly priced bid.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 38\n\nThe situation is as follows:\n\n.\n           Project\n\nConcessionare  (and  original\n             shareholding)19\n\n       Contractors\n\nEastern Harbour Tunnel\n\n100% - Kumagai Gumi (now CITIC\nhave a stake)\n\nKumagai Gumi\n\nTate\u2019s Cairn Tunnel\n\n37% - Nishimatsu\n25% - New World\n20% - China Resources\n18% - C Itoh, Jardine, Trafalgar\nHouse\n\nWestern  Harbour  crossing\n\n35% - CITIC\n35% - Cross Harbour Tunnel\n\nGammon, Kumagai Gumi,\nNishimatsu\n\nCountry Park (Route 3)\n\n50% - Sun Hung Kai\n50% - 3 Chinese group (China\nResources, China Travel, Bank of\nChina)\n\nNishimatsu, Gammon\nDragages\n\nThe evidence from Hong Kong, China\u2019s experience is that:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe bids have attracted very strong concessionaires and contractors - giving Government\nconfidence that they will deliver on the very demanding projects offered.\n\nThere was only one bidder for WHC. A further bidder comprising the Cross Harbour\nTunnel Company and CITIC pulled out when they received high fixed cost bids from\ntheir contractors. In this case the bidding nearly failed.\n\n\u2022 Negotiations have resulted in major reductions in bid prices.\n\n\u2022 Contractors \u2018volunteered\u2019 to take on risks to sweeten their bid. Thus, Nishimatsu were\nprepared to take on the risk that the Government may not have resumed all the land\n(i.e., the resulting risk of delay).\n\nThe change in tariff adjustment introduced during the WHC negotiations, was too late to\n\nstop the only 2 bidders combining, which undermined Government\u2019s negotiating position.\n\nGovernment  provides  all  land  unencumbered  at  no  cost,  and  also  often  a  substantial\n\ninvestment in access roads. All other costs must be paid from toll and ancillary revenues.\n\nHow profitable are Hong Kong, China\u2019s BOT roads? In Hong Kong, China, there has been\nup-front Government support, land has been provided free and approach roads beyond the immediate\nvicinity of the tunnels, have been funded by government. Given this, the financial viability of the\nconcessions is summarized as follows:\n\n19 The Cross Harbour Tunnel Company wanted to be involved in WHC, because their concession runs out in 1999.\n\nCITIC  wanted  to  be  involved  in  WHC  because  they  were  involved  in  Eastern  Harbour  Crossing  -  and  with  the  Cross  Harbour\nTunnel tolls low, WHC and Eastern Harbour Crossing competed.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 39\n\n\u2022 Cross Harbour Tunnel is hugely profitable. The 30-year franchise concludes in 1999,\n\nand Government is considering what to do then.\n\n\u2022 Eastern Harbour Crossing is probably OK. Traffic was lower than forecast for the first\n2/3  years  because  the  linking  infrastructure  was  not  open,  but  is  now  close  to\nprojections.\n\n\u2022\n\nTate\u2019s Cairn Tunnel is in trouble. No dividends have yet been paid to shareholders (it\nopened  in  1991).  It  suffers  from  \u2018competition\u2019  from  Lion  Rock  Tunnel,  which  is\ngovernment-tolled. The banks will suffer if there is no success in increasing revenues.\nThe concession company has gone to great lengths to attract traffic - e.g., offering\npetrol tickets (giving discounts at Mobil stations). They have tried reducing tolls - but\nlost revenue. Originally they attracted almost 100 percent of trucks but the Lion Rock\ntunnel charges $6 flat (irrespective of truck type), and Tate\u2019s Cairns now carries very\nfew  trucks.\n\n\u2022 WHC is in trouble, with revenue much lower than forecast. Its success depends\non the Airport/Route 3 corridor, and the Government policy on tolling the Cross-\nHarbour Tunnel. The financing is all non recourse and the banks will suffer if it is\nnot profitable.\n\n\u2022 Route 3 opened late in 1998 and early reports are that traffic is much lower than forecast.\nIts HK$15 toll has failed to attract motorists despite the considerable saving in time that\nthe tunnel offers over the alternative free, but much longer routes. Traffic was recently\nreported as 33,000vpd, compared with a tunnel capacity of 135,000vpd.\n\nThus of the five projects, there is one definitely profitable, one or two probably profitable and\n\ntwo or three in trouble.\n\n3.\n\nProject  Identification\n\nThe Hong Kong process is dramatically different from the rest of Asia, with a thorough\nand  effective  process  being  led  by  the  Government.  There  are  a  series  of  Comprehensive\nTransportation Studies (CTS), updated every five years. These determine future strategy. They\nare  supplemented  where  necessary  by  sectoral  studies,  for  example,  the  second  Rail\nDevelopment Strategy has recently been completed. Government is actively involved in these\nstudies, making sure it \u2018owns\u2019 their results. One result of this process is that the uncertainties of\nfuture development strategy and transport strategy are much less than is the case in most Asian\ncountries.\n\nProjects can also be identified by the private sector. In this case the project is subject to the\nsame  subsequent  investigations  as  would  be  expected  in  a  publicly-identified  project  and  to\ncompetitive bidding. The only advantage for the unsolicited bidder is the lead-time he has in studying\nthe project.\n\nThere are currently two competing tolling technologies, providing non-stop passage at\ntoll plazas for vehicles with tags. The tag companies require drivers to have a bank account\nin credit, and they are billed periodically. It is clearly inconvenient when drivers pass through\ndifferent  tunnels  remembering  which  requires  which  tag,  and  the  2  companies  have  now\nmerged, resulting in one technology applied across all tunnels where auto-tolling has been\nintroduced.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 40\n\nIt is likely that there will always be a dual system (electronic tags and manual) because:\n\n\u2022 Government does not wish to force drivers to open a monthly account.\n\nThe tollgates are a means of merging many to 2 or 3 lanes, and controlling the traffic\nflow.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe tags provided are a way of \u2018jumping the queue\u2019.\n\n4.\n\nResults of the Process: Projects\n\nTable Al .5 and Figures Al .7 and Al .8 summarize the extent, characteristics and status of\n\nBOT expressway projects in Hong Kong, China:\n\n\u2022\n\nThere were four BOT expressways operational at the time of the case study visit.\n\n\u2022 One other was under construction (this opened in late 1998).\n\n\u2022 An update of CTS is underway, from which a pipeline of projects will be identified, and\nfrom which other BOT projects are likely to emerge - but it is expected not many.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe projects, often tolled tunnels, include the expressway accesses either side to the\nfirst turn-off/last entry ramp, and the concessionaire is required to manage this, control\nthe traffic, and maintain it\n\nIt is expected that about HK$200 billion will be spent on the roads sector over the next 8-10\n\nyears, with most projects underway by 2002-2003.\n\n\fTable A1 .5: Hong Kong, China: BOT Expressway Project Characteristics\n\nAppendix 1, page 41\n\n    Project\n\nStatus\n\n     Project\n\nCost  US$\n billion  20\n\nOperational\nCross-Harbour\nTunnel\n\n1972\n\n1.9km\n\nEastern\nHarbour\nCrossing\n\n1989\n\n\u00a3340mn\n$0.54mn\n\nRoad and MTR\n2km immersed\ntube linking\nKowloon and Hong\nKong Island\n\nBOT (reverse tender) - government has 25%\nstake\nCross Harbour Tunnel Co.

Cross Harbour Tunnel traffic is at capacity with more\nthan l00,000vpd. The Tate\u2019s Cairn traffic was within 2 percent of forecast on opening and now\ncarries  about  75,000vpd,  but  with  a  capacity  of  l00-105,000vpd.  The  WHC  is  carrying  around\n30,000vpd compared with an expected 65,000; the opening of the airport and Route 3 were expected\nto improved this situation greatly.\n\nAll operators use advertising etc. to increase their revenues by around 5 percent.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions and Comments\n\nIn terms of process Hong Kong, China\u2019s system is without doubt Asia\u2019s leader, through\n\nits combination of:\n\n\u2022 A territory which is amenable to BOT - because of hills and the harbor which need\ncrossing. The BOT projects comprise three harbor crossings, one land tunnel, and one\nland tunnel combined with Route 3.\n\n\u2022 A Government which has an effective integrated land use/transport planning system.\nThis reduces uncertainty as to future development, and the future transport network, as\nwell as allowing the suitable BOT projects to be identified.\n\n\u2022 A Government which over 25 years has learned pragmatically as projects have been\n\ndeveloped (they have opened in 1972, 1989, 1991, 1997, 1998).\n\nThe process has been improved to seek the right balance between:\n\n\u2022 Government\u2019s interests in not providing guarantee or investment.\n\u2022 User interests in low tariffs.\n\u2022 Concessionaire\u2019s interests in a reliable financial return.\n\u2022\n\u2022 A dynamic market of investors, contractors, bankers, and consultants.\n\nLenders interests by putting a floor under the downside risk.\n\nMuch of this has been accomplished when political uncertainty surrounding the lead up to\n\nthe 1997 handover has made financing problematic.\n\nOver  the  period,  five  major  BOT  projects  have  been  completed,  one  every  5  years  on\naverage. Each has involved massive effort by Government throughout the planning, implementation,\nand operational phases. It may be conjectured that in terms of person-months effort the Hong\nKong, China Government and its advisers spend many, many times the effort of most other Asian\ngovernments  in  planning  and  procuring  BOT  projects.  The  results  are  projects  which  promote\npublic policy, secure innovation, and the benefits of competition.\n\nAlongside BOT projects, Government has let management contracts for Government tunnels,\n\nand latterly for the innovative Tsing Ma Control Area.\n\nHong  Kong,  China  has,  in  the  past,  transferred  the  vast  majority  of  risks  to  the\nconcessionaire, and provided no guarantees. This was very successful with the first project, the\nCross Harbour Tunnel. Subsequent tunnels have not been so successful, requiring higher tolls\nto  make  them  viable,  and  problems  from  the  competition  created  by  the  cheaper  tolls  of  the\ncentrally-located  Cross  Harbour  Tunnel.  In  the  future,  government  recognizes  it  will  have  to\nassume  a  greater  proportion  of  risk  if  private  sector  financing  of  road  infrastructure  is  to  be\nforthcoming.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 45\n\nLooking ahead, a massive new roads program is envisaged, more than HK$200 billion\nover 8-10 years, with most projects starting construction by 2002. Perhaps surprisingly, however,\nthere may not be much more private funding of Hong Kong, China\u2019s transport infrastructure. The\nmain reasons are:\n\n\u2022 A lack of suitable projects - most major corridors will have a tolled bridge/tunnel operated\nby Government or the private sector. So far, Government has not considered reverse\ntender BOT projects, in which it would invest.\n\nThe  size  and  riskiness  of  some  projects,  which  are  not  amenable  to  private  sector\nfunding.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe availability of parallel \u2018free\u2019 routes.\n\nThere may be opportunity for far more corridor management by the private sector, but as\n\nyet there is no view that this should happen.\n\nIt may be conjectured that with speculation about the RMB and HK$, Government will not\n\nbe able to avoid shouldering the foreign exchange risk in the future.\n\nThe big problems to date have been:\n\n\u2022\n\nTariffs and tariff increases. The new approach described above does much to reduce\nthis.\n\n\u2022 Parallel  Government  tolled  facilities.  This  has  caused  severe  problems  for  some\nconcessionaires. In the future, Government policy may have to change, with bids for\nfuture concessions sought on the basis of specific tolls levels and their future increases.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 1\n\nOTHER  EXPERIENCE\n\nA.\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\n\n1.\n\nContext\n\nHistorically,  there  has  been  little  travel  between  cities,  and  PRC  depends  upon  the  rail\nsystem (and lately air transport as well) for the main inter-urban movements. The road system is\npoorly developed. Most roads are single 2-lane carriageways, although some dual-carriageways\nexist. Provinces often impose tolls on road users at irregularly spaced toll plazas. Typically, the\ntraffic using the existing road system includes animals and bicycle traffic, farm vehicles such as\nsmall tractors (rotovators on wheels with trailers), a high proportion of goods vehicle, and few cars.\nAverage speeds are low, accidents frequent, and congestion can be severe as the high proportion\nof slow vehicles reduces road capacity.\n\nTraditionally,  road  construction  has  been  the  responsibility  of  the  public  sector,  with\nconstruction undertaken by government and the provinces. Some provinces have set up specific\ndepartments to manage expressway construction, although these are always subservient to the\nprovince for revenues.\n\n2. Government Policy\n\nGovernment used to be strongly against tolls, but it is now supportive and developing policies\nfor tariff setting, provision of tax exemption during the debt service period etc. Almost all expressways\nin PRC now collect tolls. Operations are complex, involving government and provincial corporations.\nThe tolls vary by location and project.\n\nGovernment has determined to construct a large National Trunk Road System, linking all\ncities greater than 0.5 million people (Figure A2.1). This will comprise 12 trunk highways comprising\n35,000 kilometers of expressways (like the US interstate freeways). Many World Bank (e.g., Beijing-\nTianjin, Xiamen-Guangzhou) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects comprise sections\nof this network, implemented under loans to Government or provinces.\n\nFunding for roads comes from a combination of:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe State (a Ministry of Communications support which used to be around 3 million\nRmb/km for any expressway on the planned network - and is now a loan).\n\nThe Provincial budget - taxes and user charges which include tolls on existing roads.\n\nIncreasingly, expressway financing has moved from central to the provincial authorities,\n\nwho access private funds and foreign capital markets.\n\nCities are treated differently and are under different jurisdiction. Expressways are more\ndifficult  to  develop  in  urban  areas  for  the  usual  right-of-way  reasons,  but  both  Shanghai  and\nGuangzhou have a ring road system, and Beijing has a tolled expressway to its airport.\n\nGovernment has recently announced a massive investment program in infrastructure, and\nis about to finalize a framework (for build-operate-transfer (BOT), corporatization, concessioning,\nleasing) and Implementing Rules and Regulations which are intended to \u2018open China\u2019 to foreign\ninvestors. The currently unclear and complex approach to private sector funding may then become\nclearer.\n\n\fTable A2.1:  China National Trunk Road System\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n2\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 3\n\n3.\n\nPRC  is  Different\n\nPRC is different - because toll roads are often \u2018profitable\u2019 - that is the toll revenues are\nadequate to fund their capital, operations and maintenance costs and provide an acceptable return\nto shareholders. This is because:\n\n\u2022 Capital  costs  are  low,  inputs  are  often  not  costed  at  market  prices,  and  technical\nstandards are \u2018appropriate\u2019. Typically, toll roads in PRC are built with large contingents\nof local labor mobilized by the local Governments, together with local materials. The\nsole  non-local  component  is  the  thin  blacktop  at  the  end,  and  the  sole  high-tech.\nmachinery is that required to apply it. The result is a very low capital cost.\n\n\u2022 Revenues are high. This is a combination of:\n\n- High traffic diversion to the toll-road at opening: the alternative is either nonexistent\n\nor heavily congested, so that the time savings are large.\n\n- Relatively  high  tolls,  which  are  acceptable  (there  is  little  history  of  resistance  to\n\ngovernment-imposed tariffs).\n\n-\n\nTolls are often a small proportion of the perceived total journey cost (which includes\nprovincial taxes, routine bribes to the police, and fuel). Hence, they are regarded by\nmany companies/drivers as \u2018good value for money\u2019 given the large time saving over\nthe alternative congested road, with more efficient use of the vehicle resulting.\n\n- High traffic growth, a result of rapid economic growth, and a lack of alternative routes.\n\n4.\n\nPrivate Sector Participation (PSP) Practices for Toll Roads\n\nMost of the concessionaires for privately-financed toll roads have been based upon joint\nventures with public entities. These may be foreign-owned, equity joint ventures or cooperative joint\nventures. The latter is most common, allowing flexibility in the allocation of rights and obligations\nbetween the local and foreign partners.\n\nTraditional forms of project financing are rare in this sector, and most foreign financing is\nsourced from equity investments and shareholder loans to cooperative joint ventures in PRC from\nthe parent company abroad. These funds are typically raised through a public offering of shares, or\nthrough commercial loans; for example, nine PRC highway stocks had been listed on the Hong\nKong Stock Exchange by 1997. In a few cases conventional project financing has been achieved,\nwith the public sector entity guaranteeing the revenues of the project company.\n\nIt is estimated that 2,800kms of expressways have passed into private hands in the last 5-\n6  years,  raising  some  US$5  billion-US$6  billion  of  private  capital.  There  are  about\n800 concession agreements, all of which are either leasing or Buy-Operate-Transfer. Typically,\nan upfront payment is made by a developer, the proceeds of which are used to further develop\nthe network. There are no conventional BOTs.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 4\n\n5.\n\nKey Issues\n\nMuch  has  been  learned  in  this  sector,  and  both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  been\nactive  in  assisting  government  develop  its  policy  framework  for  PSP.  The  main  issues  which\nhave arisen include:\n\n\u2022 Concerns with asset securitization. This is in widespread use, an existing asset (e.g.,\nan expressway built under multilateral funding assistance) has been used to raise finance\nfrom  foreign  investors.  Typically,  construction/completion  risks  are  carried  by  the\nGovernment entity, and the Government accesses additional financing readily, while\nthe prospect of returns from tolls are high for the private sector. The concern is twofold:\nthat the assets may be over-leveraged (compromising the ability to repay the original\nloan), and that use of the capital markets may not be a secure source of funding, in the\nevent  of  the  boom-bust  characteristics  of  many  stock  markets.  This  is  a  particular\nconcern in the light of the recent crisis.\n\n\u2022 Need for reform to the legal and regulatory environment. There are many problems at\npresent, including the fact that the currency is not convertible (and access to foreign\nexchange when it is required), limitations on provisions of guarantees by Government,\nno automatic increases in tolls, institutional complexities when central Government is\ninvolved etc.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nLand acquisition has led to frequent delays, and the private sector has been expected\nto  shoulder  unreasonable  risks.  Capacity  building  in  Government  and  adequate\ncompensation are required to remedy this.\n\nThe  credit-worthiness  and  commitment  of  public  entities  has  sometimes  frustrated\nand delayed development in the sector, and substantially increased costs due to the\nresulting risks.\n\nToll levels - there has been early resistance to the level of tolls on expressways, which\ncan be relatively high (over seven US cents/km for large cars on some roads). Traffic\nflows are certainly low on a number of expressways near major cities (e.g., around\n10,000vpd on the Beijing-Tianjin expressway, and even less on both Shanghai -Jiading\nand  Shanghai-Xinshang-Sungzeng).  However,  a  more  commercial  approach  to  the\nproblem is now evident. Thus, truck drivers are now often reimbursed by their firms for\ntoll  receipt  tickets  collected  when  they  use  the  expressway  (ensuring  they  use  the\nexpressway), and different rates may be applied to \u2018foreign\u2019 and local vehicles (see\nbelow). When tolls are not excessive, there is now little resistance to them. Most of the\ntraffic on the inter-urban network comprises goods vehicles and buses - cars are still\nthe exception and are usually owned by Government entities.\n\n\u2022 Need  for  transparent  procurement  processes  \u2013  private  negotiation  rather  than\ncompetitive bidding is the common practice. The negotiations have sometimes lasted\nmany years and after the event, have been found unsatisfactory (understandings have\nnot been delivered).\n\nThe role of ADB and the World Bank has been important in increasing the effectiveness of\nthe PSP approach in this sector. An ADB-funded study of the road sector in PRC, completed in\n1998, concluded that construction risk is best left to the public sector, but that when expressway\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 5\n\ntraffic grows to a sufficient level, leasing or securitization should be considered to mobilize private\ncapital for the sector.\n\nOften ad hoc deals take place, based upon relationships between Hong Kong, China or\nTaipei,China  investors  and  a  city  -  maybe  from  which  they  originate.  Alternatively,  government\ndevelopment companies may be given the task of implementing a required project, and they may\nhave  stakes  in  foreign  contractors.  These  deals  involve  no  competition,  and  may  have  a  wide\nrange of incentives and obligations.\n\n6.\n\nKumagal Gumi (Hong Kong, China) and Everbright1\n\nKumagai (Hong Kong, China) recently became partly owned by China Everbright - a PRC\nGovernment  development  company.  They  expect  thereby  to  become  substantially  involved  in\ninfrastructure development in PRC. The mechanism may typically be:\n\n\u2022\n\nThe mayor or governor of a municipality/province identifies the need for a project (e.g.,\na bridge or expressway), and sells the concept to Beijing.\n\n\u2022 Beijing decides that it warrants investigation and requests one of its development arms\n\n(such as Everbright) to look at its feasibility.\n\n\u2022 Subject  to  a  satisfactory  outcome  it  is  then  requested  to  negotiate  a  deal  with  the\n\nappropriate authority, and then implement the agreement.\n\n\u2022 Kumagai (Hong Kong, China) are then given a contract by Everbright on agreed terms\n\nto manage implementation, employing sub-contractors as necessary.\n\nThis  approach  offers  attractive  prospects  to  foreign  firms,  minimizing  their  risk,  while\n\nproviding their expertise in developing PRC\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThere are, however, many other problems, and these are acting as a constraint on the\nfuture development of the road system, with some developers generally cautious about making\nthis type of investment in PRC. The case study of Hopewell Holdings illustrates the issues:\n\n7. Hopewell Holdings2\n\nHopewell\u2019s much-publicized involvement has been in the Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Zhuhai\n\u2018golden triangle\u2019, conceived as part of a strategic vision (Figure A2.2). This is notably different to the\nad-hoc projects seen elsewhere in Asia, and is innovative in concept, the individual projects linking\nto, and reinforcing each other. Their characteristics and status are as follows (Table A2.1):\n\n1\n\n2\n\n  This is based on discussions in Hong Kong, China.\n  Interviewed as part of the Hong Kong, China case study.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 6\n\nTable A2.1: Hopewell Holdings PRC Projects\n\nProject\n\nStatus\n\nRoute-kms\n\nOther\n\n30  year  operating  franchise  from  1997.\nHopewell  Holdings  receive  50%  of  profits\nfor  Years  1-10,  and  about  45-50%  for  the\nnext  20  years.\n\n123kms, closed\ntoll system\n\nTolls  increased  twice.  71,000vpd  in  1997\n(20%  increase  over  1996)\n\nGuangzhou-\nShenzhen-Zhuhai\n(GSZ)  Superhighway:\n\nA  non-stop\nexpressway.\n\n\u2022 GSZ East to\n  Shenzhen\n\n\u2022 GSZ West to\n  Zhuhai\n\nShunde Roads\n\nParallel Route 107\nHas a low level of\nservice,  with  tolls\ncharged at some\nbridges\nPart opened 1994 -\n22 out of 58 kms\n\nOpened 1996.

In 1983 Sir\nGordon Wu became involved in a hotel development after experiencing brownouts, hence\na power station, and then this expressways concept.\n\nThe various agreements reached depend for large measure on agreement being reached\nabout many issues - they were not water-tight contracts. The contract allows a 15 percent\nFIRR for the tolled expressway, together with land development.\n\nFunding is from a US$800 million syndicated loan from 34 banks (60 percent) and 40\npercent equity. Income is in RMB or HK$ - i.e., foreign exchange risks.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 7\n\n\u2022\n\nLand acquisition and costs have been a major problem. The GSZ requires a continuous\nstrip of land 1 23kms long and 50-80m wide:\n\n-\n\nthe contract said \u2018government would help\u2019 - but responsibility was with Hopewell Holdings,\nwho did not have the power to make it happen.\n\n- Hopewell Holdings are liable to land costs, which the government determined should\n\nbe at market rates.\n\n\u2022\n\nThese factors resulted in a 3-year delay in implementation.\n\n\u2022 Once problems of acquisition were settled, construction was rapid.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Hopewell Holdings had understood that Hong Kong-plated cars would be allowed to\ntravel relatively freely into PRC - for example for day trips to Guangzhou. But this has\nnot  been  allowed  by  the  Hong  Kong,  China  Government,  and  traffic  is  lower  than\nexpected.\n\nTax has been problem - Hopewell Holdings are required to pay taxes on gross revenue as\nwell as withholding and land tax. There have been differences as regards the intent of the\nconcession  agreement.\n\n\u2022 Property  development  has  been  a  problem.  This  has  been  frustrated  by  difficulties  in\ntransferring land rights, allowing changes in permitted use and requiring that social facilities\nbe linked to development. Little has yet happened, and the recent property downturn has\nreinforced these problems.\n\n\u2022 Petrol  stations  are  being  leased  along  GSZ  East,  together  with  facilities  for  buses,\n\nrestaurants, vehicle service centers and car parks.\n\nTechnical  standards  -  there  have  been  differences  concerning  road  capacity  and\nstandards.\n\nTariffs are as follows:\n\n- Different tariff for Hong Kong-plated vehicles and PRC vehicles, with trucks 4/5 times,\nand buses 3/4 times the car tariff. Note that Hong Kong-plated vehicles pay double the\nPRC rate3\n\n-\n\nToll increases are by application to the Price Bureau, not automatic. Hopewell Holdings\nhave succeeded twice in raising tariffs.\n\n3\n\nThe  actual  tariffs  on  the  Guangzhou-Shenzhen  Superhighway  are:\nVehicle  class\nCar, small van, mc\nLight goods, light buses, vans\nMedium goods, medium buses\nLarge  goods,  large  buses,  trailers\nMulti-axle vehicles, 4Oft container trailers:\n\nPRC: RMB/km\n0.6\n1.2\n1.8\n2.4\n3.0\n\nHK: HK$/km\n0.8\n1.6\n2.4\n2.6  (after  discount)\n3.2\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 8\n\n\u2022 Hopewell Holdings are looking to market the road to truck operators to increase traffic\n\n-an innovative approach.\n\n\u2022 Traffic:\n\nTraffic is 71,000vpd (1997) on GSZ East. Since a poor start at 38,000vpd in 1994 to\n49,000 in 1995, 59,000 in 1996.\n\nPRC-plated traffic is in line with forecasts, but Hong Kong, China vehicles are low\nbecause of the unanticipated delay in relaxing cross-border restrictions.\n\nTraffic is mainly buses, trucks and container-trucks, not cars.\n\n90 percent of revenue is from PRC vehicles.\n\n30 percent growth in toll revenue in 1997 over 1996.\n\nFigure A2.2:      Hopewell Holdings PRC Projects\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 9\n\nB.\n\nIndian  Sub-Continent\n\nIn recent years India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have endeavored to progress\nparticipation of the private sector in the provision of roads. There have been flurries of international\ninterest in all four countries, but progress has been at best very slow. Of all sectors of infrastructure,\nthe roads sector is recognized as the most risky, even in countries where there is a demonstrable\nability to pay for road use. The risk is substantially higher in countries where no track record - either\nof successful PSP or public acceptance of toll roads - exists.\n\nIt is concern over the limited economic capacity of users in the Indian Sub-Continent to pay\nfor road space, which has dissuaded potential investors. This could be partially offset by government\nguarantees or at least an understanding of, and realistic sharing, of project risks. But in countries\nwith a recent history of, and ongoing evidence of, civil unrest, strong labor union influence, and\npolitical instability, government commitments may not count for much. India has made the most\nsustained effort to attract private investment in its roads.\n\n1. India\n\nThere are about 39,000 km of National Highway, less than 5 percent of which is 4-lane,\nabout 80 percent 2-lane, and the rest is single lane. Since 1991, the Government of India has\nadopted  a  more  liberal  attitude  towards  private  sector  involvement  in  the  management  and\ndevelopment of the country\u2019s road system. In 1994 the Ministry of Surface Transportation actively\npromoted the development by the private sector of a \u201csuper national highway\u201d ultimately to be\n10,000kms of dual-carriageway segregated route along the main national corridors. The plan was\nto let PSP concessions first for a few well-trafficked routes to be followed by further concessions\nwith roads opening throughout a 30-year development period.\n\nState governments also actively promoted private sector involvement, since they saw PSP\nas a means of achieving their own shopping list of roads projects, invariably with no real appreciation\nof the requirements of a bankable project.\n\nThe Government took important steps to attract the private sector, including necessary\nlegislative  changes  to  expedite  toll  road  concessions,  but  despite  this  it  became  apparent  that\nmajor expressway projects could not attract international interest without substantial Government\nguarantees. Not surprisingly, international interest soon waned, but domestic investors remained\npositive, and positioned themselves for the time when Government expectations might be more\nachievable.\n\nThe plans for a whole new expressway network have now been shelved and the Ministry of\nSurface Transportation plans to four-lane about 14,000km of the existing network over the next 10\nyears.  The  priority  corridors  linking  Delhi,  Bombay,  Madras,  and  Calcutta  total  6,000km,  and\n5,000kms of this has still to be widened. Technical project preparation is in hand for most of this\nlength.\n\nAbout eleven BOT concessions have been let, all small projects - bridges and bypasses, to\nmajor Indian players. These projects require relatively low long-term capital investment, and have a\nmore easily-captured revenue.\n\nTolls  are  being  charged  on  a  section  of  the  Delhi/Bombay  road.  A  franchise  for  toll\ncollection was let, but the concessionaire is facing problems because of low traffic. In India, it\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 10\n\nhas proved important to keep the truck drivers (highly unionised) happy, and relations between\nstate and the central government are sometimes problematic, frustrating project development.\n\nIt is envisaged that much of the planned network upgrading will be funded through the\nWorld Bank, but the Ministry of Surface Transportation is trying to define criteria for the selection of\nlengths which could be viable for private sector funding. Government has put one rupee per liter\n\u201croad tax\u201d on the price of petrol (not diesel yet), and this could provide public funding support for\nPSP deals.\n\n2. Pakistan\n\nPrior to 1995, the Government of Pakistan, through the National Highway Authority, had\noffered a variety of projects to the private sector for development on a BOT basis. Generally, the\nprojects were not well prepared and were not supported by independent feasibility analysis. This\nresulted in international bidders having serious doubts about the credibility of the National Highway\nAuthority and its ability to understand and therefore to deliver any commitments made. Recognizing\nthis, ADB funded a technical assistance project to prepare a comprehensive plan for PSP in the\nroad  sector,  covering  policy  formulation,  institutional  development,  the  preparation  of  model\nprocedures and documents, and the identification of projects worthy of detailed feasibility study. A\nprivate sector cell within the National Highway Authority was set up, among other things to administer\na proposed Private Sector Highway Development Fund.\n\nThe  Government  has  initiated  a  major  (US$5  billion)  motorway  program,  but  lack  of\nprofessional resources to administer the program is likely to undermine credibility. A number of\nprojects have been promoted, but none yet implemented as BOT.\n\nThe operation and maintenance contract for the recently opened Lahore-Islamabad Motorway\n\u2014 constructed using contractors credit \u2014 is reportedly being awarded to a private consortium with\ninternational members, which is also seeking to complete and operate the Lahore Bypass and\nLahore Ring road within the same contract.\n\n3.\n\nBangladesh\n\nThe Government of Bangladesh has signaled its intention to bring about economic reform\nand take measures to attract private sector investment in infrastructure. Emphasis has been put\non  the  power  sector  and  in  1996,  the  Government  established  a  Power  Cell,  charged  with\ncoordinating the country\u2019s private power program, which it is doing with notable success.\n\nIn the road sector, the only initiative taken by the Government (and World Bank) to date has\nbeen the evaluation of the Dhaka Eastern Bypass as a BOT project. As part of the consultancy\nstudy, model procedures and documentation were prepared which could form the basis for road\nsector PSP policy and plans. Realistically, however, this should be viewed as the first step towards\ndeveloping  an  appreciation  by  the  public  and  private  sectors  of  the  realities,  opportunities  and\nlimitations of PSP in the country\u2019s roads sector.\n\nTo  build  upon  this  start  and  spread  the  program  to  other  sectors  of  infrastructure,  the\nGovernment, with international support, has established a Private Sector Infrastructure Development\nFund and an organization to administer it. But realistically, the road sector will need to fall in line\nbehind power and telecommunications which will be perceived by private investors as providing\nbetter, less risky opportunities.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 11\n\n4.\n\nSri Lanka\n\nThe country\u2019s Road Development Authority does not have the resources \u2014 financial or\nprofessional \u2014 to progress major road schemes. The Airport Expressway (ColomboKatunayake)\nhas been a Road Development Authority priority since the early \u201880s, with no progress made as\nyet. The Road Development Authority has offered the project for PSP and international companies\nhave made exploratory investigations. If any corridor can offer a viable PSP scheme, then it must\nbe this one. The fact that international interest has not resulted in any positive moves suggests\nthat it could be some time, dependent upon improvement in the internal situation, before private\ninvestment in Sri Lanka\u2019s road sector will become a reality. Having said this, the Government is\nagain actively seeking to promote this project as a BOT project, but now with some government\nsupport.\n\n5.\n\nThe  Problems\n\nThe private sector perceive the following problems which need to be overcome before\n\nsignificant private sector investment will occur in the road sector in the Indian Sub-Continent:\n\n\u2022     Lack of institutional capacity and experience in project finance.\n\u2022\nLimited consumer affordability and low traffic densities.\n\u2022 Unclear tariff policies and absence of regulatory framework.\n\u2022\nLack of transparency and competition in procurement.\n\u2022 Political instability, civil unrest, labor union power.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 12\n\nC.\n\nIndonesia\n\n1.\n\nDevelopment of Toll Roads\n\nBetween 1978 and 1990, Government financed all toll roads. The state toll road agency\nJasa Marga initially operated them, but later took responsibility for financing and construction.\nThe 46 km Jagorawi toll road south of Jakarta was the first such toll road, and Jasa Marga was\nresponsible for toll collection and maintenance. The finance for toll roads was sourced through\nforeign loans repaid by the Ministry of Finance, and low-interest bonds sold to employee pension\nfunds.\n\nAfter 1990, the Government granted a license to Jasa Marga to develop, construct, and\noperate toll roads in cooperation with the private sector. Presidential Decree 25/1 987 required that\nJasa Marga be involved in all toll road construction. Private entities were required to set up joint\nventures with Jasa Marga, who were therefore both investor and regulator.\n\nThere are two forms of private sector arrangement:\n\n\u2022 Build-Transfer-Operate. A cooperation agreement is signed with Jasa Marga, and the\nroad is handed over to Jasa Marga once constructed. The private investor receives a\nshare of the toll revenues over the concession period.\n\n\u2022 Modified turnkey. Investors fund, design, and construct the toll road. Jasa Marga then\noperates  the  road  and  the  investor  receives  an  agreed  share  of  revenues,  with  no\ninvolvement in the operations.\n\nSince 1994, foreign investors can work with Indonesian companies in promoting projects.\n\nThey are required to cooperate with Jasa Marga through a domestic joint venture.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s Sixth National Development Plan provided for the construction of 688 kms of\ntoll  roads  by  1999,  and  1935  kms  by  2020.  By  mid-1997,  15  projects  and  472  kms  had  been\nconstructed, of which 150 kms had been constructed and were being operated by private sector\nconcessionaires.\n\n2.\n\nKey Issues\n\nThere have been many problems to date, as follows:\n\n\u2022 Uncertainty about tariff adjustments. This has required the approval of the President to\n\nevery such change, undermining confidence in the revenue stream.\n\n\u2022 Transparency  in  procurement.  Concessions  have  usually  been  granted  to  well-\nconnected parties, and not as the result of competitive bidding. This has distorted the\nobjectives of PSP.\n\n\u2022\n\nLand acquisition. This has been problematic and a major problem. Responsibility for\nthe  cost  is  with  Government,  yet  they  have  sometimes  tried  to  transfer  this  to  the\nprivate sector.\n\n\u2022 The  road  planning  framework  has  sometimes  been  weak,  and  there  has  not  been\n\nconfidence that the projects identified for implementation are the key priorities.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 13\n\n\u2022\n\nThe domestic capital markets for private capital have been small, leaving the government\nbanks and pension funds as the only sources of domestic capital.\n\n\u2022 Privatization of Jasa Marga. Prior to the crisis, it was the government\u2019s intention to raise\nsubstantial funds from this. It is now recognized this will not be possible and the role\nand capitalization of Jasa Marga are under consideration.\n\n3.\n\nThe Economic Crisis and Government Response\n\nThe economic crisis hit Indonesia hard, resulting in a major currency realignment, increased\ndomestic  interest  rates,  increased  petrol  prices,  lower  traffic  Ievels,  and  lower  expectations  of\nfuture traffic. This has created major problems for existing projects, and the collapse of the domestic\nbanking sector has stopped all ongoing toll road projects.\n\nThe Government has taken steps to restructure the toll road program in the light of these\n\nevents. All projects have been reviewed, and been prioritized.\n\nThese changes, together with political changes, have led government to reappraise and\nrealign its policy for PSP in the light of the new imperatives. Presidential Decree 7/1998 provided a\nmajor change to the procurement of toll roads. This:\n\n\u2022 Mandated the issue of open competitive bidding for all infrastructure projects.\n\n\u2022 Required such projects to come from a \u2018List of Infrastructure Development projects\u2019\nthat had been subject to initial screening on their bankability and planning aspects.\n\n\u2022 Mandated  that  all  unsolicited  bids  would  be  subject  to  competitive  bidding.  Work  to\n\nimplement these provisions has proceeded.\n\nAs noted above, all toll roads have been reviewed and prioritized, and the future of Jasa\n\nMarga is under consideration.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 14\n\nD.\n\nLatin America\n\nLatin America has many examples of PSP in the roads sector, and three countries have\n\nbeen selected as of direct relevance to this technical assistance:\n\n\u2022 Argentina, which has innovated extensively\n\n\u2022 Mexico, which has implemented a vast BOT program of expressways - with many\n\nlessons.\n\n\u2022 Colombia, where the government has a system of public tolled roads as well as a road\nconcessioning  program.  The  concessioning  program  has  had  regional  economic\ndevelopment as one of its objectives.\n\n1.\n\nArgentina\n\nThere are three different approaches to private sector investment in roads in Argentina:\n\n\u2022 Concessions - for rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of 9,000 kms of the main\n\nroad network with traffic volumes of at least 2,500vpd.\n\n\u2022 Construct, operate, and maintain for a relatively small network of non-tolled national\n\nroads, in good condition. This approach is still under development.\n\n\u2022 Contrato de Recuperaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento (CREMA) for rehabilitation and maintenance\nof 14,400 kms of the national road network. Most of the roads in this program required\nsome initial rehabilitation work.\n\nThe  Government  introduced  these  private  sector  initiatives  because  of  a  crisis  in  road\nmanagement by the end of the 1 980s when under-funding over many years had left Argentina with\nthe  worst  maintained  network  among  all  upper  middle  income  countries.  Thirty  percent  of  the\npaved roads were in poor condition in 1989.\n\nIn 1989, the Highway Reconversion decree anticipated private sector involvement in highway\nmatters and this was followed by the State Reform Law which provided for Direci\u00f3n Nacional de\nVialidad (DNV) to repair and maintain the national arterial road network through partial or total\nconcessions. Since then, the mechanisms by which the private sector is involved, have evolved.\n\na.\n\nConcessions\n\nThe first mechanism for private sector involvement was to concession approximately 9,000\n\nkm of the main road network. The call for bids, in 1989, specified that:\n\n\u2022 Concessions would run for 12 years.\n\n\u2022 There was a fixed toll structure. There was a uniform rate per kilometer for each class\nof vehicle and tolls were then applied on the basis of size of vehicle, number of axles\nand  distance  from  last  toll  plaza.  There  was  also  some  inflation  protection  for\nconcessionaires, through a formula involving Consumer Price Index (CPI), Wholesale\nPrice Index and the US dollar value.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 15\n\n\u2022 A list of initial rehabilitation works, which had to be completed before tolls could be\n\ncollected, was specified.\n\nelapsed, was specified.\n\n\u2022 A list of priority works, which had to be completed before 3 years of the concession had\n\n\u2022 A  list  of  improvement  works,  which  were  necessary  to  keep  the  road  at  the  quality\n\nrequired for the 12 years of the concession, was specified.\n\n\u2022 No Government guarantees for the project were given.\n\n\u2022 The  concessionaire  was  required  to  form  a  corporation  or  joint  venture  for  the  sole\n\npurpose of administering the concession.\n\n\u2022\n\nIncome above expected levels would be used to improve the level of service provided\non the roads.\n\n\u2022 The concessionaire must control excess loads at weighing stations and were authorized\n\nto collect compensation from such loads.\n\n\u2022 The concessionaire was required to take legal responsibility for any accidents occurring\n\nbecause of a poorly maintained road.\n\nHowever, it did not specify how the corridors must be packaged, leaving bidders free to bid\n\nfor groups of corridors.\n\nAll 147 bids were assessed in terms of the appropriateness of their traffic studies and on\nthe economic and financial plans which they involved. A weighted formula was used to consider\nthe following elements for all bids:\n\n\u2022 Total expenditure on:\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\ninitial works\npriority works\ninvestment in improvement works\ninvestment in any additional works\n\n\u2022 Proposed routine maintenance work.\n\n\u2022 Proposed toll collection system and facilities.\n\n\u2022 The \u2018canon\u2019 to the state - which was the key criterion. In Latin America, the term canon\nis widely used to refer to payments from private sector to Government for the right to\nprovide, and charge for the provision of, a service.\n\nConcessions were awarded in 1990. The road segments all had at least 2000-2500 vpd.\n\nThe total canon to be collected by the Government was US$890 million (in 1990 dollars).\n\nA control entity was established to manage the concessions on behalf of the DNV. It\nensures that the concessionaires comply with their technical obligations and deals with relations\nwith road users. However, it relies on the concessionaires for all the traffic and toll revenue\ninformation.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 16\n\nProblems with the concessions approach were, however, already evident by early 1991:\n\n\u2022 The convertibility law in February 1991 set the Argentinean dollar to parity with the\nAmerican  dollar  thereby  doubling  the  relative  price  of  the  toll  for  local  users\n(to  around  $3  per  100km).  This  pegging  also  made  the  tariff  escalation  clauses\nillegal.\n\n\u2022 The concessionaires were collecting tolls without having undertaken the initial works.\n\n\u2022 Tollbooths  were  located  to  capture  traffic  in  suburban  areas  which  was  generating\n\nsignificant popular opposition to the program.\n\nThe  DNV  suspended  contracts  and  re-negotiated  the  concession  agreements.  The\n\nrenegotiation led to the following changes:\n\n\u2022 Reduction of tolls by 50 percent.\n\n\u2022 Elimination of the canon payments.\n\n\u2022\n\nIntroduction of government subsidies of around US$57 million per annum (allocated\nbetween concessionaires on the basis of their value added tax contributions \u2013 in effect\ntherefore a shadow toll).\n\n\u2022 Relocation of the tollbooths.\n\n\u2022 Changes to the schedule of works.\n\n\u2022 Extension of the concessions to 13 years.\n\nTraffic on these inter-city concessions more than quadrupled between 1991 and 1996.\nThis  took  toll  revenues  from  around  US$60  million  in  1991  to  US$258  million  in  1996.  The\ngrowth, however, flattened out because of the recession from 1995 onwards. Maintenance also\nimproved greatly, so that only 25 percent of roads were in bad condition in 1993 and a predicted\n10 percent in 1997.\n\nThe government proved reluctant to allow toll increases and hence the support payments\nrose from US$23 million in 1991 to US$65 million in 1996 (the Government has not estimated\nwhether the private sector is maintaining roads at a lower cost than the public sector did prior to\nconcessioning.)\n\nSubsequently about 500km of the network has been concessioned on the access roads to\nmajor  cities  (starting  with  Buenos  Aires  in  1992).  These  concessions  involve  some  new\nconstruction and are for longer durations - in Cordoba for example a 349 km network has been\nconcessioned for 25 years.\n\nThe structure of the access roads concessions is similar to that described above, in particular,\nthey require substantial investments before tolls can be levied and there are no traffic guarantees.\nHowever, the concessions were usually bid on the single criterion of the basic toll level (which is\nindexed  on  the  US  CPI).  Concessionaires  were  also  sometimes  required  to  build  parallel  free\nroads, mainly to act as collector streets.\n\nOne  example  of  these  access  roads  was  the  Acceso  Ezeiza  Canuelas  (the  Ricchieri\nTollway). This contract consists of improvements to the existing 16 km highway (from central\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 17\n\ncity to airport), construction of a new 31 km road, at the end of the existing road, and maintenance\nand operation of the full length of the road. Tolls cannot be levied until the end of the construction\nperiod (two years) and will be adjusted annually on the basis of the US CPI. The peso toll level is to\nbe adjusted monthly to reflect changes in exchange rates.\n\nThe concession was awarded for 22 years and 8 months in 1993 and the award criterion\nwas the size of canon that the concessionaire would pay the Government. The Government and\nconcessionaire worked together to identify the alignment which represented a balance of economic\nand socio-economic objectives. The concessionaire is required, under the contract, to build another\nlane if the traffic level grows above a certain threshold.\n\nThough  very  innovative,  the  concession  was  undermined  when  the  largest  of  the  six\ncompanies in the consortium went into receivership in March 1996 and the project has therefore\nbeen put on hold.\n\nSome of the new construction for these concessions has required land acquisition and\npopulation  resettlement.  This  has  been  managed  by  the  relevant  provincial  government  with\nassistance from municipalities as necessary. The risks associated with this were, however, assigned\nto the concessionaires and this did lead to significant delay on two of the concessions (such that by\n1997 construction was still delayed).\n\nIn 1995,  the Government  issued rules on concession re-negotiating. All negotiations in\n1991 had been on a bilateral basis, with each party looking to maximize its gains. There were no\nrules to specify what could and what could not be changed. The new rules however determine all\noptions and terms of eligibility so that each concessionaire is dealt with on the same basis. In\nDecember  1996  the  regulation  of  concessions  for  road  and  rail  was  handed  to  a  new  agency\nreporting to the Secretary for Public Works and Transport.\n\nTypically the concession companies are joint ventures of Argentinean and International\n\nconstruction  companies.\n\nThe IFC has lent to two toll road projects in Argentina:\n\n\u2022 REC Toll Highway - approved in 1995. The project is $161 million with an International\n\nFinance Corporation (IFC) loan of $20 million.\n\n\u2022 Western Access Road - approved in 1996. The project is $272 million with an IFC loan\n\nof $35 million.\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank is currently preparing a loan to support the Cordoba\n\naccess roads project through the 2 year construction phase before tolls can be levied.\n\nb.\n\nCOT  (Construct-Operate-Maintain)\n\nThe construct, operate, and maintain network includes 1,879 km of national roads to be\nconcessioned under a non-tolled arrangement. The government will allocate US$36 million per\nyear for the up-keep of these roads. Arrangements for this form of concession are still being developed\nin 1998.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 18\n\nc.\n\n CREMA (Rehabilitate and Maintain)\n\nThe contracts under CREMA are fixed price rehabilitate and maintain contracts for five\nyears. Bidding is highly specified in terms of defining the minimum level of service and contracts\nare awarded to the lowest bidder.\n\nThe CREMA system operates on a performance, or output, rather than on payment for the\nquantity of work done. The minimum level of rehabilitation is specified by DNV and must be carried\nout  within  the  first  year  of  the  contract  (following  detailed  engineering  design).  Maintenance\nrequirements are specified and are regularly inspected (though inspection team size is minimized\nthrough the output specification). The requirements are categorized in the following way - potholes,\ncracking,  rutting  on  pavement,  condition  of  shoulders,  culverts,  drains,  bridges,  roadside,\nenvironment,  horizontal  and  vertical  signs.  Penalties  for  non  compliance  on  each  item  are\nestablished. The contracts are specified in this manner in part to ensure that the concessionaire\nhas an incentive to rehabilitate efficiently since he will then be required to maintain the road for the\nfull five year concession period.\n\nThe program covers around 14,400 km (in 100-300 km networks). 11,818km were let\nduring 1997 in 61 separate contracts, at about $1 1,000 per km/year. Rehabilitation is expected\nto  account  for  approximately  75  percent  of  the  total  cost.  Between  5  and  20  proposals  were\nreceived for each package.\n\n2. Mexico\n\nThe Mexican Government awarded 53 concessions for 5,500 km between 1989 and 1994,\nthereby doubling the national toll road network. By the first quarter of 1995, 44 of these were in full\nor partial operation (5,120km).\n\nThe Secretary of Communications and Transport was responsible for the concessioning\nprogram. Concessions were let under the General Means of Communication law. The concessions\nwere not to exceed 15 years (later extended to 30 years) and a parallel free alternative to the\nhighway was required. Other state level road concessions were also awarded. These tended to be\nmodeled after the federal arrangements.\n\nSpecial purpose entities for the toll road projects were required, and these were typically\nconsortia  of  local  construction  firms  (though  they  were  not  always  special  purpose  entities  in\npractice). The call for bids defined the project in terms of:\n\nLocation of interchanges and tollbooths.\n\n\u2022     Alignment.\n\u2022\n\u2022 Number of lanes.\n\u2022 Design and construction standards.\n\nThe Government supplied bidders with traffic and cost projections and basic designs. Bidders\nwere assessed on many criteria but were favored if they promised to transfer roads back to the\nGovernment in a short period. This was partly because of the concern that only short-term financing\nwould be available, but also because the administration was looking for \u2018success\u2019 within its period\nof office.\n\nThe concession agreement specified the tolls to be charged, by category of vehicle,\nwhich  were  to  increase  semi-annually  in  accordance  with  the  consumer  price  index\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 19\n\n(or  whenever  the  CPI  rose  by  5  percent  or  more  following  the  previous  adjustment).  Most  toll\nchanges had to receive written approval from the government. Traffic levels were guaranteed by\ncategory  of  vehicle.  Where  the  actual  volumes  fell  short  of  the  guaranteed  levels,\nconcessionaires  were  entitled  to  request  an  extension  to  the  concession  to  recover  their\ninvestment.\n\nAs the concessions were initially set for very short periods (as short as three years in one\ncase) the concessionaires negotiated very high toll rates. Given these high tolls, forecast traffic did\nnot materialize and concession periods were extended.\n\nOther problems included:\n\n\u2022 Substantial  construction  cost  overruns  (for  example,  on  the  267  km  road  from\nCuernavaca  to  Acapulco  the  cost  over  runs  were  around  200  percent  and  the  time\ndelays  about  30  months.).  In  some  cases,  this  was  because  the  concessionaires\nprovided  \u201csweat  equity\u201d.  Originally  this  accounted  for  around  20  percent  of  the\ninvestment costs but as lenders demanded higher equity cushions so the construction\nbudgets rose.\n\n\u2022\n\nFailure to concession a cohesive network so that long distance traffic was not attracted\nto the new roads.\n\n\u2022 Under-staffing at the Ministry of Communications and Transport which led to long permit\napproval times and inadequate enforcement of the requirements of the concession (for\nexample, bidders were required to post construction bonds but these were either not\nlodged or not effective)\n\n\u2022 A weak pre-qualification process which did not ensure that concessionaires had the\ntechnical capacity to plan and design the road. For example, some traffic projections\nwere that trucks would account for between 20 and 45 percent of the traffic. In fact,\ntrucks turned out to account for only about 5 percent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that\nthere was a black market in toll receipts which allowed truckers to use the free alternate\nroutes while pocketing the toll charges.)\n\n\u2022 Weak  scrutiny  from  lending  banks.  Large  amounts  of  non-recourse  financing  were\nprovided  by  government-owned  commercial  banks  without  undertaking  their  normal\nproject screening or appraisals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this was because\nbanks understood that all projects would be supported by government even if they\nproved commercial failures. Even had the Banks been undertaking such due diligence,\ntheir negotiating position was weak since they were not allowed a collateral assignment\nof the concession agreement (i.e., they had no right to take over the infrastructure if\nthe sponsor firm collapsed)\n\n\u2022 Right-of-way  acquisition  was  not  completed  before  the  construction  began.  Since\nopposition to the projects grew and acquisition became more problematic, construction\ncosts rose as machinery stood idle and interest costs increased.\n\n\u2022 Government reacted to local pressures by specifying change orders unilaterally.\n\n\u2022 Concessionaires did not avail themselves of the right to develop ancillary services (a\nright which extended for two years past the end of the concession) and paid little heed\nto the need to provide good access roads.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 20\n\n\u2022\n\nThere tended to be very few bidders for each project (few international investors were\nattracted, in part because of their unfamiliarity with the Mexican legal system which\ngoverned the concessions \u2014 there was no recourse to international arbitration)\n\nThe  December  1994  currency  crisis  in  Mexico  brought  matters  to  a  head,  since  traffic\nlevels dropped off steeply. By March 1995, only 5 of 32 projects which were operating could\nmeet their base case revenue projections. On average, actual project revenues were 30 percent\nbelow original projections. The companies were not marketing the time and distance savings\nthat the roads could provide, but even with this the very high tolls would have been significant\ndisincentives.\n\nBy early 1997 the World Bank\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department estimated that nearly\n40  projects  (with  $1  1.5  billion  in  equity  and  debt  investments)  had  submitted  requests  to  the\nGovernment for financial restructuring. In August 1997 the Government of Mexico announced a\nrestructuring package of around (US$8.9 billion for 23 projects). The government also planned to\nreduce tolls for cars and trucks by 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively.\n\nDespite all of these difficulties, three projects did successfully refinance before the 1994\ncrisis.  The  IFC  was  involved  in  the  refinancing  of  the  Toluca  toll  road  in  June  1992.  Generally\ndespite high interest rates, the deal was not well received because of the tight debt service coverage\nratios and the currency risk. The two other projects to be re-financed were the Ecatepec-Pir\u00e1mides\nand Manzanillo Armeria roads and the Mexico City-Cuernavaca road.\n\nThere have been publicly-owned tolled roads in Colombia for many years. In 1993 two laws\nwere passed which now permit transport concessions. The Government has subsequently developed\na three-tier system of concessioned roads:\n\n3. Colombia\n\n\u2022 Expansion of existing roads.\n\u2022 New construction.\n\u2022 Road maintenance.\n\nOne particular objective of the program is to develop roads in those areas where economic\ndevelopment  requires  further  development  of  the  road  network.  The  Government  developed  a\nstandard basic contract, which has been adapted for each of the tiers.\n\nOne of the criteria on which concessionaires are selected is the lowest proposed tariff.\nThe concessionaires, in theory, estimate the level of toll that they would require to cover the\ninvestment costs to achieve a \u201crate of return equivalent to that which would be achieved from\nanother project facing similar risks\u201d. If these tolls are deemed politically unacceptable, then the\nbidders must consider altering construction plans, the design of the construction, or requesting\ngovernment investment.\n\nThe Bogota to Villavicencio Road concession was signed in 1994. This consists of repairs\nto 13.5 km of road, construction of 34 km (including two tunnels), construction of two underpasses,\nrehabilitation of 7.5 km and various auxiliary works. The Government agreed to rehabilitate another\n55 km section of road and to build a new tunnel. The contract for all the work was divided into three\nstages \u2014 design and programming, construction, and operation. Each stage is of fixed duration\nand the contract ends at the end of the operating stage (16 years from the start of the project) when\nthe road reverts to Government at no charge.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 21\n\nThere are several interesting aspects to the agreement:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nLand acquisition - the National Roads Institute acquires the land for the concessionaire,\nthough this is paid for by the concessionaire. The cost of the land is specified in the\nconcession  agreement,  and  the  national  roads  fund  is  required  to  compensate  the\nconcessionaire if the total cost rises above the agreed level.\n\nTreatment of revenues - the tolls charged from the start of the operating period will\nrise with CPI, but only if the index moves 20 percent from the last adjustment, or once\na year. Though this is established in the concession agreement, the National Roads\nInstitute  may  refuse  to  grant  permission,  but  must  then  compensate  the\nconcessionaire.  Minimum  and  maximum  revenue  streams  for  the  concessionaire\nare also specified in the concession agreement (on the basis of traffic levels by vehicle\ntype). Where toll revenues are less than the minimum in any given year, the national\nroads  institute  compensates  the  concessionaire  for  the  difference.  Where  the  toll\nrevenues are greater than the maximum, then the concessionaire places 50 percent\nof  the  excess  in  a  special  account  and  the  rest  will  be  used  to  pay  for  additional\nmaintenance  costs.  The  funds  in  the  account  will  be  used  by  the  National  Roads\nInstitute to pay the concessionaire when revenues fall below the minimum, or to fund\nadditional works.\n\n\u2022 Dealing with environmental permission processes - If this process is delayed, but the\nconcessionaire is not at fault, the concession is suspended until the end of the delay.\nWhere  this  seriously  affects  the  economic  position  of  the  concessionaire,  there  are\ncompensation mechanisms in the concession agreement.\n\nDespite  all  these  arrangements,  there  have  been  difficulties.  Detailed  engineering  was\ncompleted within the specified period, but determined that the project cost would be far greater\nthan first thought. This led to renegotiation of the concession agreement. The Government too has\nfaced difficulties (cost overruns and delays) in undertaking its construction obligations.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 22\n\nE.\n\nEastern  Europe\n\n1.  Overview\n\nThe ambition to involve the private sector in funding the development of the road network in\nthe former Eastern Europe has not so far been fulfilled in practice. Table A2.2 identifies the road\nsector projects submitted to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for\ntheir consideration and their current status. Of the eleven projects submitted, only two, both in\nHungary, have been implemented with private finance.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why most private sector transport infrastructure projects\n\nhave not reached fruition. EBRD cite the most important as:\n\n\u2022 Poor  financial  viability,  particularly  for  motorway  projects  -  projects  may  be\neconomically attractive but not financially viable without a contribution from the public\nauthorities. In the case of motorways, EBRD\u2019s experience is that upgrading roads\nto full motorway standards is likely to be economically and commercially viable for\nvery few (if any) sections, in the short to medium term, if rigorous evaluations are\nconducted. Despite initial hopes and aspirations, present income and traffic levels\nin the region are usually too low to generate sufficient toll revenue to service the\ndebt of a fully privately-financed facility.\n\n\u2022 Public affordability and political acceptability - political factors have been behind the lack\n\nof progress of some concession projects in the region:\n\nIt  may  not  always  be  acceptable  that  transport  infrastructure  is  provided  by  the\nprivate sector, usually involving foreign interests.\n\nProposed toll levels may be out of reach of local motorists traveling for their own\npurposes, rather than on corporate or other business, which will recompense toll\npayments. This can preclude political acceptability.\n\n- Governments may be reluctant to lose control of a strategic asset.\n\nBureaucrats may be reluctant to see the private sector take control of an asset on\nwhich they should continue to be employed.\n\n\u2022\n\nLevel and equitable allocation of risks - lenders may not be willing to take full traffic risk\narguing that it is properly an equity risk. They may therefore require support from the\nstate, in the form of:\n\n- Guarantees of a base level of traffic or revenue (Spain).\n\nProvision of cash-flow deficiency guarantees (Hungary).\n\nLinking the concession period to the outturn traffic volumes (Dartford Crossing and\nSecond Severn Crossing, United Kingdom (UK)).\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 23\n\nTable A2.2: Road Projects Submitted to EBRD for Consideration\n\nCOUNTRY\n\n          PROJECT\n\nCOMMENT\n\nCroatia\n\nM12  Zagreb-Gorican\n\nDiscussions  under  way  with  government\u2019s  preferred  tenderer\nSubject  to  review\n\nZagreb-Karlovac-Rijeka\nD5  Motorway\n\nConcession tender canceled and project completed by the State\n\nCzech\nRepublic\n\nHungary\n\nM1-M15 Toll Motorway\n\nprivate financing using BOT structure; M1 opened to traffic in January ;\n1996;  outturn  traffic  about  40  per  cent  lower  than  forecast\n\nSzekszard  Bridge\n\nM5 Toll Motorway\n\nM3 Toll Motorway\n\nConcession  awarded,  but  project  never  reached  financial  closing,  due\nto poor financial viability\n\nprivate  financing  using  BOT  structure;  first  section  opened  to  traffic\nDecember 1996\n\nhaving tendered the project as a BOT concession, the government\ndecided in September 1995 to cancel the tender and build the\nmotorway  as  a  state  sector  project\n\nM7 Toll Motorway\n\nConcession  tenders  submitted;  government  reviewing  options\n\nPoland\n\nA-2  Motorway\nConcession\n\ntwo  concession  tenders  submitted\n\nA-4  Motorway  Operating\nConcession\n\nPreferred  tenderer  selected  by  government\n\nRomania\n\nInitial  motorway\nconcession\n\nConcession  advertised  July  1996\n\nEBRD\u2019s past experience with the M1/M15 Motorway in Hungary (see Case Study below)\nmay lead it to require project sponsors or the host state to bear traffic risk. Where substantial\npublic support is required to a privately-funded scheme, conflicts can arise, reflected in legal\narrangements  and  risk  premiums  and  adverse  effects  on  project  development  and\nimplementation.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nLack of equity - returns to shareholders in early years can be limited by long construction\nperiods, debt service obligations, and slow traffic/revenue build-up. For the M5 Motorway\nin Hungary, first dividend payments are permitted only 10 years after financial closing.\nThus, only those with a construction interest are likely to invest, which leads to conflicts\nof interest difficult to control. Competing investment opportunities are likely to be more\nattractive.\n\nLack of local funding - for projects that generate mainly local revenues, part of the debt\nhas to be denominated in local currency to limit exposure to currency devaluation and\ninflation risks. Local financial and capital markets in the region are generally insufficiently\ndeveloped for this type of funding. EBRD supported local funding instruments for the\nM1/M15 Motorway in Hungary such that 50 percent of the debt is denominated in local\ncurrency. Otherwise the host-state might guarantee a fixed exchange rate (as in Spain).\n\n\u2022 Regulatory and legal constraints - ideally there will be a concession law in place. In the\nabsence of such a law, lenders will require various security arrangements, the absence\nof which will reduce their willingness to participate.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 24\n\n\u2022\n\nLack of convincing examples from Western Europe - most of the Central European\ncountries  look  to  Western  Europe  for  examples  of  privately  financed  infrastructure.\nUnfortunately, there are few examples and success has been mixed.\n\nEBRD now believes there are likely to be few (if any) financially viable motorway concessions\nin the region in the next five years or so, without substantial public sector financial support. EBRD\nwill continue to aim to mobilize private finance for transport infrastructure through concessions and\npublic/private partnerships. But it expects opportunities to be limited and to focus more on co-\nfinancing operating assets and transport services, leaving infrastructure financing to, say, the World\nBank and European Investment Bank which have mandates for sovereign lending.\n\nCase studies of the two motorway projects in Eastern Europe which have been implemented\nusing private funding, both in Hungary, are presented below, together with the current situation in\nPoland as another case study. The conclusions from these case studies and the experience generally\nin Eastern Europe are set out below.\n\n2.\n\nCase  Studies\n\n3.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe three case study examples presented below provide common themes which illustrate\nthe  problems  associated  with  involving  the  private  sector  in  developing  the  region\u2019s  motorway\nnetwork:\n\n\u2022 Governments  had,  and  may  still  have,  ambitious  plans  for  the  development  of\n\ncomprehensive motorway networks utilizing private finance.\n\n\u2022 Current levels of income (gross domestic product (GDP)/capita is currently estimated\nat  US$6,500-US$7,S00  in  both  Poland  and  Hungary)  and  vehicle  ownership/usage\ngenerate toll motorway daily traffic flows in the range of 7,000-10,000.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nInitial traffic forecasts in support of concession bids have often been substantially higher.\n\nThe construction of motorways in Eastern Europe is not significantly cheaper than in\nWestern Europe where vehicle ownership and incomes, and therefore the ability and\nwillingness to pay tolls, are higher.\n\nIt follows that the private sector cannot bear all of the traffic/revenue risks. Substantial\ngovernment contributions, of up to 50 percent of project costs, are required to make\nprojects bankable.\n\nLenders will be increasingly reluctant to participate in such projects without independent\ntraffic forecasts on which to base financing decisions and government contribution to a\npublic/private partnership.\n\nThe EBRD foresees few, if any, privately-funded motorway projects proceeding in the\nformer Eastern Europe in the next few years.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 25\n\nCASE  STUDY: M1/M15 MOTORWAY, HUNGARY\n\nThe  Project\n\n43  km  of  dual  2-lane  motorway  linking  an  existing,  untolled  126  km  of  motorway  in\nHungary with 60 km in Austria, to complete Budapest-Vienna link (M1).\n\n14 km spur towards Bratislava (M15), one carriageway to be completed by December\n1997, the second by December 2002.\n\n\u2022 M1 opened at the beginning of 1996 as the first tolled motorway in the former Eastern\n\nEurope.\n\nImplementation Process\n\nLong term motorway development plan approved by Hungarian Government in 1991.\nM1/M15 identified as suitable for limited recourse project financing.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n5 consortia shortlisted in 1992, 4 bids submitted.\n\n2 preferred tenderers selected in Nov 92, winner selected in Feb 93.\n\n\u2022 Contract signed in April 93, financial closing in December 93.\n\nGovernment  Contribution\n\n\u2022 Preliminary design, building permits, environmental clearance.\n\n\u2022\n\nLand (about 5 percent of project cost).\n\n\u2022 Undertaking of no tolls on existing 126 km of motorway prior to 2005.\n\n\u2022 Acceptance of phased approach, eg, M15 second carriageway.\n\n\u2022 Some restrictions of HGV movements on parallel road.\n\nConcession  Terms\n\n\u2022\n\nTotal project cost was ECU 329 million (US$325 million): construction costs = 67 percent,\nconcession company\u2019s costs = 18 percent, capitalized interest = 15 percent.\n\n\u2022 Concession terms required equity to be at least 20 percent of project cost.\n\n\u2022 All commercial, operational and financial risks borne by concessionaire and debt\n\nproviders.

While parts of Continental Europe,\nnotably France, Italy and Spain, were developing tolled motorway networks employing private sector\nfunding, tolls were considered and not pursued in the UK for the following principal reasons:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe density of development in the UK and the density of the road network led to concerns\nthat the imposition of tolls would divert substantial numbers of trips from motorways to\nparallel roads, giving a reduction in efficiency and leaving the motorways underused.\n\nThe density of the road network and hence the large number of intersections on the\nmotorway network would have led to high toll collection costs.\n\nThere,  exceptions  to  the  general  rule  of  an  untolled  motorway  network  are,  estuarial\ncrossings, the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, and, of greatest interest, the recent DBFO Road\nprogram.\n\nEstuarial Crossings\n\nMajor estuarial crossings were tolled on the grounds that they were expensive pieces of\ninfrastructure to build and they provided users with substantial savings through the avoidance of\nlong, circuitous journeys via the nearest upstream crossing. By the late 1980s, there were 11 tolled\nestuarial crossings, funded by the public sector through grant and loans. The total debt in the early\n1980s exceeded \u00a3400 million and annual interest payments were not being covered by net revenues.\nInterest was being capitalized and was unlikely to be fully paid.\n\nSecond Dartford Crossing. The private sector became involved in the funding of the road\nnetwork when the Dartford River Crossing Ltd. (with Trafalgar House, now Kvaerner, as a major\npartner) funded, almost exclusively through debt not equity, and built the Queen Elizabeth II\nBridge  at  Dartford.  Dartford  River  Crossing\u2019s  concession  allowed  them  to  collect  the  toll\nrevenues from the existing tunnels and the new bridge for a period up to the full repayment of\nthe debt. The new bridge opened in October 1991 and the debt is expected to be repaid in the\nyear  2000.  At  that  point,  under  the  legislation  now  in  place,  the  crossings  will  revert  to  the\npublic sector, tolls will continue for a year to develop a fund for maintenance, then tolls will be\nwithdrawn.\n\nSecond Severn Crossing. This is conceptually similar to the Second Dartford Crossing.\nSevern River Crossing Ltd has bought the concession to operate the existing bridge and toll both\nbridges for a period of 30 years.\n\nOther than these estuarial crossings, the only attempt at a tolled section of motorway in the\n\nUK to date has been the Birmingham Northern Relief Road.\n\nBirmingham Northern Relief Road\n\nThe Birmingham Northern Relief Road was planned in the 1980s as a relief road for one of\nthe more congested sections of the UK\u2019s motorway network in the conurbation of Birmingham,\nwhich has a population of around 2 million. The proposed Birmingham Northern Relief Road was\naround 40 km long, it was considered at Public Inquiry in 1988 and was intended to be the first\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 30\n\nroad  in  the  UK  subject  to  a  competition  for  private  sector  design,  construction,  finance  and\noperation.\n\nFollowing pre-qualification, three groups were invited to submit bids for the concession by\nOctober 1990. In August 1991 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the successful\nbidder, Midland Expressway Ltd (MEL).\n\nMEL reviewed the alignment and junction arrangements of the preferred route from the\n1988  Inquiry  and  proposed  changes.  Consultation  on  these  changes  with  local  authorities,\ngovernment departments and the public was required to satisfy the government that the proposals\ncould pass through the statutory planning process. Some substantial changes were made to the\nproposals as a result of the consultation process. The new preferred scheme was then resubmitted\nto the planning process in 1992. 6 years later it is still subject to appeal.\n\nIt  is  reminiscent  of  Catch  22.  Innovative  ideas  are  required  from  the  private  sector.  If\nthese affect scheme designs, requiring a change in published orders or new orders, schemes\nhave to go back through the planning process. But it is the public sector that is best equipped to\ntake schemes through the planning process, and the private sector would prefer not to get involved\nuntil all such procedures are completed. How then can a private sector contribution to scheme\ndesign be obtained?\n\nDesign-Build-Finance-Operate  (DBFO)  Schemes\n\nThe DBFO process was announced in December 1993, and the first four contracts were\nlet in 1996. Now eight contracts have been let, in two tranches, and some \u00a31 billion of finance\nraised. Under these contracts, private sector concessionaires build, operate and maintain sections\nof  trunk  roads  or  motorways  over  30  years.  In  return,  the  concessionaires  are  paid  by  the\ngovernment according to the number of vehicle kilometers driven on the road. Road users will\nnot  pay  directly  for  using  the  road.  This  payment  mechanism  has  come  to  be  described  as\n\u2018shadow tolls\u2019.\n\n1.\n\nObjectives\n\ncontracts,  were:\n\nThe intentions of the government, represented by the Highways Agency (HA), in letting the\n\n\u2022 New  roads  to  be  designed  and  constructed,  and  the  new  and  existing  roads  to  be\nmaintained and operated safely and satisfactorily so as to minimize any adverse impact\non the environment.\n\n\u2022\n\nTest the enthusiasm of the market for such contracts across a range of scheme types.\n\n\u2022 Assist in the establishment of a road operating industry within the private sector.\n\n\u2022 Promote innovation.\n\n\u2022 Maximize value for money through the use of a competitive process and by allocating\n\nrisks between the public and private sectors in the most appropriate manner.\n\nIn the remainder of this section we comment on:\n\n\u2022\n\nThe shadow toll payment mechanism.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 31\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe variety of projects being implemented under DBFO.\n\nThe risks, particularly traffic risk, borne by the concessionaire.\n\nThe DBFO bidding process, which has been thoroughly audited and praised by the\nNational Audit Office.\n\nThe use of public sector comparators in that process.\n\n\u2022 Whether the intentions of establishing a road operating industry and promoting innovation\n\nare being realized.\n\n2.\n\nShadow Toll Payment Mechanism\n\nThe shadow toll payments are made by the government to the concessionaire on the basis\nof the vehicle kilometers traveled on the defined section of road by vehicles in two categories -\nheavy goods vehicles and other vehicles. Bidders had to put forward their required payment per\nvehicle km:\n\n\u2022 By the two vehicle categories.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn each of four bands (payment for the first x million vehicle km, the next y million, etc).\n\n\u2022 With a zero payment specified for band 4, i.e., vehicle km in excess of the upper bound\n\nof band 3 which was specified by the bidder.\n\nA key evaluation criterion was the HA\u2019s estimation of the required payments to each bidder\n\nusing the HA\u2019s traffic forecasts and each bidder\u2019s proposed payments schedule.\n\na.\n\nVariety of DBFO Projects\n\nThe  initial  DBFO  projects  have  varied  in  their  size  and  in  their  nature,  in  the  balance\nbetween initial construction and on-going maintenance. For the first four schemes, the present\nvalues of expected payments range from \u00a362 million-\u00a3232 million (US$100 million-US$372\nmillion):  the  length  of  new  road  construction  varies  from  3  km  to  52  km.  The  initial  four\nschemes  were  all  inter-urban  schemes.  As  experience  of  the  DBFO  process  is  gained,\nconsideration  is  being  given  to  DBFO  projects  in  urban  or  pen-urban  areas  and  to  DBFO\nprojects  which  have  no  new  construction  but  consist  solely  of  maintain-finance-operate\ncontracts.\n\nb.\n\nRisk  Transfer\n\nTraffic risk was largely passed to the selected bidder. The zero payment for traffic in excess\nof defined volumes limited the government\u2019s exposure. But the nature of shadow tolls and the\nDBFO schemes limits the traffic risk to the concessionaire:\n\n\u2022\n\nThere are no user tolls or payments, which removes a major component of the traffic/\nrevenue risk for a conventional tolled expressway.\n\n\u2022 DBFO schemes to date have more often been the on-line improvement of an existing\nsection of the trunk road/motorway network than the development of new routes, which\nreduces the modelling/forecasting risk.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 32\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Nevertheless, the payment to the concessionaire is related to the traffic volume, which\ncontributed to the DBFO projects satisfying the UK Treasury and European Union rules\non the transfer of risk to the private sector as a necessary PFI condition.\n\nFor the initial DBFO projects, the public sector bore the planning risk, since all the projects\nhad been taken through statutory planning stages as public sector projects. The following risks\nwere shared between the public and private sectors:\n\nTraffic risk. As discussed, the private sector bears the downside risk and the public\nsector bears the capped upside risk.\n\n\u2022 Protester action. On some projects it is borne by the concessionaire, on others it is\n\nshared.\n\nForce Majeure. Most force majeure risks lie with the public sector, but equity holders\nare not compensated if termination occurs as a result of a force majeure event.\n\nThe concessionaire bears the following risks:\n\n\u2022 Design and construction.\n\n\u2022\n\nLatent/inherent defects which arise during 30 year concession period.\n\n\u2022 Delivery/timing,  unless  due  to  government-required  changes,  in  which  case\n\ncompensation may be payable.\n\n\u2022 Operation and maintenance.\n\nIndemnity/insurance.\n\nLegislative, except where the law is discriminatory against operators or DBFO roads.\nConcessionaires  would  be  compensated,  for  example,  if  real  tolls  were  introduced\ncausing traffic volumes to fall.\n\nc.\n\nDBFO Bidding Process\n\nThe public sector had taken the DBFO schemes through statutory planning stages. The\ninterest of the market in the DBFO schemes was stimulated through a consultation process and\nmarket sounding exercise, conducted by the HA\u2019s professional advisors who were appointed in\ngood time at the start of the DBFO process. The road construction industry\u2019s interest was also\nstimulated since it was made clear that new roads would be DBFO-funded, there would be no\npublicly-funded road schemes. Four bidders were invited to bid for each of the four schemes in the\ninitial tranche; no bidder was invited for more than two schemes. A model contract was drawn up\nto which bidders could respond. There was a clear set of evaluation criteria, with the payment level\nand  banding  process  described  earlier  at  its  heart.  Best  and  final  offers  were  sought  from  the\nshortlisted bidders and competitive pressure was maintained through continued negotiation with\ntwo bidders for each scheme right up to contract award. An ex-post survey revealed that bidders\nwere broadly satisfied with the process.\n\nOn the first tranche of four schemes, the HA spent \u00a38.3 million (US$13.3 million) on its\n\nadvisors - financial, legal and technical. The bidders estimated their costs as:\n\n\u2022 Prequalification - up to \u00a30.1 million (US$ 0.16 million).\n\n\u2022 Shortlisted Bidder - \u00a31 million-\u00a32 million (US$1 .6 million-US$3.2 million).\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 33\n\n\u2022 Reserve or Winning Bidder - \u00a31 milIion-\u00a34 million (US$1.6 million-US$6.4 million)\n\nd.\n\nUse of Public Sector Comparators\n\nFigure  A2.3  shows,  for  each  of  the  first  four  DBFO  schemes,  three  sets  of  values,  all\n\nexpressed as NPVs discounted at 8 percent per annum:\n\n\u2022 Shortlisted bids. The NPV of expected payments calculated for the individual bids on\n\neach project.\n\n\u2022 NPV of expected payments. The NPVs of expected payments to the Winning Bidders\non each project, expressed as a best estimate and as a range dependent on traffic flow.\n\n\u2022 Public sector comparators. Two estimates, one by the Highways Agency and one by its\ntechnical advisors, of the costs to the Agency of acquiring the project as a conventional\npublic sector project.\n\nTypically, the public sector comparator has a higher value than the NPV of expected payments,\nleading to the conclusion that the involvement of the private sector has given value for money,\nproducing considerable savings to the public purse. The greatest savings apparently relate to the\nA1-M1  project  where  the  best  estimate  of  expected  payments  (\u00a3232  million)  falls  substantially\nbelow the two public sector comparators (\u00a3326 million and \u00a3339 million). It is not clear why this\nproject should apparently cost so much less than the public sector comparators, though it is believed\nthat it has been subject to heavy \u2018value engineering\u2019. There remains a concern that, despite project\ndesigns and standards being tightly specified by the public sector, and construction and maintenance\nclosely monitored, an inferior product will be delivered that will ultimately rebound on the public\nsector.\n\ne.\n\nEstablishment of Road Operating Industry and Innovation\n\nTraditionally  in  the  UK,  there  have  been  separate  organizations  specializing  in  road\nconstruction (normally in the private sector) and maintenance (historically in the public sector but\nincreasingly being  privatized).  Overlap between these two is beginning, with major contractors\ndeveloping  their  road  maintenance  sections  or  acquiring  maintenance  organizations.  The\nconsideration being given to maintain-finance-operate projects will encourage this process. It is\nsignificant, however, that the initial DBFO companies, all led by construction companies, all negotiated\nthe right to sell their equity after five years, suggesting that, as yet, the construction companies are\nnot wholly committed to a long term involvement in road operation and maintenance.\n\nThere has, so far, been limited innovation. Project plans and the orders following public\ninquiries constrained designs.

The principal similarities are:\n\n\u2022 Each country has a substantial toll motorway network.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe impetus in each case came in the 1950s and 1960s in response to a number of\nfactors (reconstruction following the Second World War, response to rapidly increasing\nvehicle ownership and the development of infrastructure to support developing industrial\nand tourism activity).\n\nIn each country both the public and the private sectors have been involved in the financing\nof the toll motorway network.\n\nThe involvement of the public sector in the ownership of the motorway networks in each\ncase had to be strengthened as private sector concessionaires experienced financial\ndifficulty, particularly following the energy crisis in the early 1970s.\n\n\u2022 Now the toll motorway networks in these three countries are owned in varying degrees\nby the public and private sectors, with considerable government financial support and\nprofit controls on the private sector operations.\n\nTable A2.3 summarizes the toll motorway experience in these three countries.\n\n1.\n\nFrance\n\nThere is a toll motorway network of approximately 5,000 km mainly developed in the 1 960s\nand 1 970s. The first concessions were awarded in the period 1956-1963 to five Societes d\u2019Economie\nMixte (SEMs) which are commercially structured, state owned bodies, a mix of national and local\ngovernment ownership. In 1969, four private sector concession companies were founded. Economic\nproblems  following  the  energy  crisis  in  the  early  1  970s  caused  financial  difficulties  for  these\ncompanies and in 1982 the government bought them, with the exception of Cofiroute, and converted\nthem into SEMs. An \u2018equalization\u2019 policy was introduced, with a public entity Autoroutes de France,\ncreated to manage surpluses and deficits, and ensure balanced financial operations. Currently,\nCofiroute, the one remaining concessionaire not wholly publiclyowned, owns around 15 percent of\nthe toll motorway network.\n\n\fTable A2.3: Toll Motorway Experience in France, Italy, and Spain\n\nNetwork  Characteristics\n\nFrance\n\nRoute-kms\n% of Total Motorway Network\n% Privately-owned\nHistory\n\n5,000\n72\n15 - Cofiroute\n\u2022 1956-63:  Concessions  to  SEMs\n\n5,000\n81\n2\n\u2022 1960s/70s - majority of toll network\n\nSpain\n\n1,900\n80\n85\n\u2022 mid  1960s/early  1970s\n\nConcessions  let\n\n\u2022 1969: 4 Private Sector Concession\n\nCompanies\n\n\u2022 1982:  Concession  Companies  other\nthan Cofiroute bought by government\nand converted to SEMs.  Equalization\npolicy\n\n\u2022 Autostrade S.p.A. set up to manage\n45% of motorway network, but share\ngrew as Autostrade took over loss-\nmaking  roads.\n\n\u2022 1983/84 state buys 3 (out of 13)\n\nconcession  companies\n\nState Involvement in Financing\n\n\u2022 Repayable  advances\n\n\u2022 Capital  subsidies\n\n\u2022 Government  stipulations  on  funding\n\n\u2022 Equity (State to hold a majority of\n\n\u2022 Loan  guarantees\n\nequity)\n\n\u2022 Loan  guarantees\n\nProfit Control\n\n\u2022 7%  limit  on  dividends\n\n\u2022 Limit on dividends of 8% of share\n\n\u2022 Profit limited to 10-15% of equity\n\n\u2022 Excess profits to Autoroutes de\n\nFrance\n\n\u2022 Excess profits to Central Guarantee\n\nSpecial  Reserve\n\n\u2022 Excess  profits  to  companies\u2019\n\nItaly\n\nbuilt\n\ncapital\n\nFund\n\nsources\n\n\u2022 Exchange  rate  support\n\n\u2022 Government  guarantees  for  foreign\n\nborrowing\n\n\u2022\n\nInterest free loans when traffic\ntarget not met\n\n\u2022 Tax  benefits  to  concession\n\ncompanies\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n3\n6\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 37\n\nThe state has been heavily involved in financing the construction of the toll motorway network.\nConstruction was financed largely by long term loans, with State support in the form of repayable\nadvances, loan guarantees and equity (the State was to hold a majority of the equity). The SEMs in\nthe 1 960s received advances nominally repayable over a long period, to cover 30 percent - 40\npercent of their construction costs and to cover unforeseen annual deficits. In the1970s, indexed\nbut non-interest bearing advances of around 20 percent - 25 percent of construction costs were\nmade to public and private sector companies. State guarantees of up to 70 percent of loan financing\nwere provided to both public and private sector companies.\n\nThe  SEMs  now  operate  under  a  profit  control  regime  that  allows  them  to  distribute\ndividends of up to 7 percent, with excess profits being paid to Autoroutes de France for use in\nthe equalization operation.\n\n2.\n\nItaly\n\nItaly has some 5,000 km of toll motorway mainly built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. By\nfar  the  single  largest  concessionaire  is  Autostrade  S.p.A.  whose  parent  company  is  the  State-\ncontrolled State Institute of Industrial Reconstruction. Autostrade was set up to manage some 45\npercent of the Italian motorway network. By contrast, many of the other motorway concessions\nwere awarded to companies which held only a single concession. Often the award was made on\nthe  basis  of  negotiation  with  a  preferred  bidder  rather  than  as  a  result  of  competitive  tender.\nAutostrade\u2019s share of the motorway network has grown as it has taken over loss making roads in\nreturn for an extension to its concession.\n\nState involvement in the financing of motorways has included capital subsidies, variously\nreported as less than 10 percent of the sum invested in the period to 1986 and typically 10 percent\n- 30 percent of construction costs, and loan guarantees. All of Autostrade\u2019s loans are guaranteed\nby the State Institute of Industrial Reconstruction.\n\nANAS, the autonomous national highway agency, approves the financial plans and monitors\nthe annual accounts of the toll road companies. Dividends are limited by law to 8 percent of share\ncapital. Excess profits are paid into a Central Guarantee Fund to provide collateral for loans.\n\n3.\n\nSpain\n\nSpain  has  a  toll  motorway  network  of  around  1,900  km  begun  in  the  1960s.  By  1972,\nconcessions totaling 1,000 km had been granted. The adverse effects of the energy crisis and\neconomic problems in the 1970s were met by the renegotiation of concession terms and by the\nState taking over three (out of 13) companies granted concessions.\n\nAll of the companies whose concessions were granted by the national government (9 out of\n\nthe 13) enjoy special tax benefits which reduce certain taxes and duties by up to 95 percent.\n\nThe Government laid down stipulations for the financing of toll roads. In order to limit the\nuse of local debt, minimum amounts of foreign debt and equity were specified. There are variations\namong concessions, but typically 45 percent of construction costs must be funded with foreign\ndebt and 10 percent - 25 percent with equity. In return, Government supports the concessionaires\u2019\noverseas borrowings through exchange rate assurance, whereby the Government undertakes to\nprovide the foreign exchange to service foreign debt at the rate of exchange ruling at the time the\nloan was entered into.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 38\n\nIn addition, Government guarantees a limited amount of foreign borrowing, for a fee, and\nprovides some subsidies. It has made interest-free loans to one private sector concessionaire in\nyears when traffic levels have fallen below a stipulated target. Advances have been made to\npublic sector companies to cover operating deficits.\n\nConcessionaires must each establish a Special Reserve into which they make an\n\nallocation of funds when net profit is greater than 10 percent - 15 percent of equity. There are\nrestrictions on the use of the reserve. Payments into and out of the reserve tend to restrict\ndividends to 6 percent - 15 percent of paid-up capital.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 39\n\nH.\n\nUnited  States\n\n1. California\n\nTolling or private sector provision of roads has been out of favor in the US from the early\n1950s when the Inter State Highway system was instigated. However, since the late 1980s the\nwhole issue has been revived, and by the early 1 990s several concession agreements had been\nsigned. All concessions have been awarded at the state level.\n\nThe  State  of  California  has  been  leading  this  renaissance,  with  the  first  BOT  road\nprojects  in  the  country.  All  of  the  roads  revert  to  Caltrans  (the  state  DOT  on  substantial\ncompletion) and in most cases are operated through the Transportation Corridor Agencies\n(TCA) founded in 1986. The concession legislation was passed in July 1989 to allow the four\nnew  concession  agreements.\n\nSR 91 opened in December 1995 and was the first privately funded electronically tolled\nproject in the US. There are four new express lanes, 16km long, in the median of an existing state\nroad.  The  road  is  operated  by  California  Private  Transportation  Company,  under  a  35-year\nconcession. There was a competitive bidding process, which called for ideas for private roads and\nselected those deemed technically and financially the most viable. The concession was signed at\nthe end of 1991 but financial closure only came at the beginning of 1993. In part, the process took\na considerable time, because the Government had adopted a flexible approach to project award, in\nwhich the preferred bidder and Government negotiated the final elements of the concession (with\nthe runner-up bidders held in reserve) over a period of months. This form of contract award was\nselected on the basis that it provided the government with the benefits of both innovative project\ndesign and risk sharing schemes.\n\nThe concessionaire and state signed the concession agreement on the understanding that\nthe outcome of the environmental review process might conclude that the no build option was\npreferable. Caltrans has agreed not to issue any competing concession (within a defined zone\naround the project), that it will not develop anything itself, and that it will use its best efforts to ensure\nthat no other agencies develop any such facilities. The concessionaire has rights to ancillary real\nestate development, though if they use the air space they have to pay $1 per annum rent for the first\n35 years and after than a \u201cfair market lease rate\u201d.\n\nThere  are  several  performance  incentive  clauses  in  the  concession  agreement  \u2014\nincluding the number of vehicles using the facility, the number of accidents on the road and the\nmagnitude  of  the  operations  and  maintenance  costs.  The  incentive  is  paid  in  the  form  of\nincreases in the permitted annual return on investment.\n\nThe project cost US$126 million (US$7.9 million per kilometer). US$107 million of debt was\nraised, giving a debt equity ratio of 85/15. Equity participation, through California Private Transportation\nCompany, came from Cofiroute, a French toll road operating company. US$7 million in subordinated\ndebt was provided by Orange County (the local authority in the region).\n\nOn opening, tolls varied with the time of day and day of week, between $0.25 and $2.50 for\nthe full length of the road. There is no toll rate regulation, though there is a maximum 17 percent\nceiling  on  the  return  to  total  capital  (debt  and  equity  combined).  No  tolls  are  charged  for  cars\ncarrying three or more people. Tolls are paid using a FasTrak in-vehicle tag, which are now also\nused on all of the TCA roads to ensure that all users in Southern California only require a single tag\nin their vehicle. Traffic rose from around 8,000 vehicles on an average weekday in January 1996, to\naround 25,000 by the end of the year.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 40\n\n2.\n\nOther  Schemes\n\nUS State Departments of Transportation have long issued bonds with which to fund roads\nand bridges (around US$40 million since 1950). The TCA approach allows such bonds to be issued\non a non recourse basis and to secure them solely on the basis of the toll revenues.\n\nTwo TCAs have been created in Orange County, California with the express purpose of\n\u201cProviding  significant  relief  to  Orange  County\u2019s  gridlock\u201d.  The  TCAs  are  the  San  Joaquin  Hills\nTransportation Corridor and the Foothill and Eastern Transportation Corridor.\n\nConstruction began in September 1993 and the San Joaquin Hills Corridor was fully opened\nin  November  1996,  four  months  ahead  of  schedule.  It  is  15  km  long  (with  three  lanes  in  each\ndirection and a wide median allowing for future HOV or public transport lanes) and runs parallel to\nInterstate 5. A turnkey (design/build) approach was used and the road is operated and maintained\nby the TCA.\n\nThe construction cost US$834 million, not including right of way, finance or administrative\ncosts which were funded from development impact fees, state general funds and the gas tax. In\nMarch 1993, the TCA raised US$1 .2 billion in tax exempt, non recourse toll revenue bonds.\n\nFasTrak tags can be used and the toll is distance based and for the full length of the corridor\n(for a car or motorcycle) is US$2. This is estimated to save 20 minutes from the Interstate 5 route.\nThere are five vehicle classes.\n\nFoothill and Eastern Transportation Corridor is in fact two schemes, which were cofinanced\nunder two bond issues, which were not backed by any Government body and are funded simply\nfrom the toll revenues, development fees and interest earnings:\n\n\u2022\n\nIn 1993, US$78.6 million of fixed and variable rate, non recourse, toll revenue bonds\nwas sold to finance the completion of the first section of Foothill-North (1.4 miles). The\ndesign and environmental costs of the other parts of the Foothill corridor and for all of\nthe  Eastern  corridor  (other  funds  for  construction  came  from  the  state  and  from\ndevelopment impact fees.\n\n\u2022 Similar bonds were sold in June 1995 to raise a further US$1.5 billion. These bonds,\ntogether with some more state and developer funding and the remains of he 1993 issue,\npaid for the Eastern corridor and completion of the Northern Foothills corridor, as well\nas the design of the southern part of the Foothills corridor.\n\nThe toll for the Northern Section of the Foothills corridor (7.5 miles) is US$1 for cars and\nmotorbikes. These are lower if only part of the corridor is used, varying from 25 to 75 cents depending\non distance. There are 7 classes of vehicle.\n\nBasic tolls for the Eastern Corridor will average 19 cents to 25 cents per mile. The project\nis expected to be complete by December 1999, when it will be 24 miles long and consist of two\nlanes in each direction. Traffic is expected to increase and plans have been made for 3-4 lanes\nin each direction. The total design and construction cost of the corridor, and 4.6 miles of the\nFoothill  corridor,  is  US$743.2  million.  A  turnkey  (design/build)  structure  has  been  used  for\nconstruction.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 41\n\nI.\n\nAustralasia\n\n1.\n\nAustralia\n\nThere has been some experience with BOT style investments in Australia - see Table A2.4.\nMostly  urban  projects,  these  have  included  the  Sydney  Harbour  tunnel,  the  M2,  M4,  and  M5\nmotorways. Melbourne City Link is currently under construction, and completion is expected in\n1999. The total cost of these projects is more than A$3.5 billion (with the Melbourne City Link\nestimated to require around A$1 .8 billion of this over five years.) This can be compared with total\nannual expenditure of A$1 billion on all roads in the state of Victoria.\n\nGovernment involvement in these projects has been substantial in some cases \u2014involving\n\nthe transfer of land, provision of financing and underwriting of revenue.\n\nFour major Australian Banks (National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia,\nANZ Bank and Westpac Banking) have been involved in providing the finance and in underwriting\nprojects. International involvement has commenced with the Melbourne project.\n\nThe  New  South  Wales  Auditor-General  has  prepared  reports  considering  the\nperformance of all of the Sydney projects. These reports raised particular concerns about the\nnature of the road network within which the BOT project operates and the implications of this\nfor risk sharing between Government and concessionaires. However, offsetting this has been\nthe  considerable  competition  for  the  projects,  which  is  believed  to  have  lowered  costs  and\nfostered innovation. Similarly the use of the private sector has encouraged swifter construction\n\u2014  the  M4  was  completed  nine  months  ahead  of  schedule  and  the  M5  was  completed  in  2\nrather than 4 years.\n\nRisks for the private sector have been ameliorated through Material Adverse Effect clauses\nin  the  BOT  contracts.  These  typically  provide  for  a  menu  of  responses  that  escalate  from  toll\nchanges to concession extensions to direct government financial compensation. However there\nare some protections for government in these clauses \u2014 for example, the Material Adverse Effect\nclauses of the City Link project do not require the government to compensate the developer if a\ncompeting heavy rail link is built. On the Melbourne City Link the government has also taken on\nenvironmental risks, in that the concessionaire will be compensated if any unidentified pollution or\nland contamination is discovered.\n\n\fTable A2.4: Australia: BOT Expressways\n\nProject\n\n          Status\n\n              Cost\n\n              Length\n\nDescription\n\nSydney\nHarbour\nTunnel\n\nConstruction  began\n1988,  opened\nAugust  1992\n\n4  lanes  2.3km  north-south\nof harbor\n\nConcession  to  2022\n\nM4\n\nM5\n\nExpressions  of\ninterest  called  1988.\nConstruction  period\nagreed for Jun 1990\nto February 1993,\nbut opened in May\n1992\n\nConstruction  costs\nA$l00million  (1998\nprices)  Total  capitalized\nproject  cost  estimated  at\n$246  million  (1988\nprices)\n\nWidening  of  two  sections\nof motorway and provision\nof new six lane section\nSingle toll plaza in eastern\nsection  (initially  planned\nfor  western  but  deemed\nnot financially viable)\n\nThree  stage\nconstruction.

For example 22 separate contractual\ndocuments were required for the M2 project, for which A$21 0 million of private equity was raised at\na cost of A$16 million. These costs included underwriting costs, legal costs and the cost of financial\nadvice.\n\nSome reductions in economic benefit have been perceived, as a result of contract structures.\nFor example, on the MS project, four proposed interchanges have not been built, in order to ensure\nthat toll plazas cannot be avoided and will not be built until after the financial requirements have\nbeen met. In addition, network costs are high \u2014 in Sydney there are three different types of tolling\ntechnology.\n\nSince 1990, RTA of New South Wales has been trying alternative arrangements to meet its\nmission statement - \u201cTo manage road related transport infrastructure to provide safe and efficient\naccess to the road network for the people of New South Wales\u201d.\n\nInitially it contracted out for maintenance management and some maintenance delivery on\ntwo networks in Sydney. These were not performance-based contracts since the authority took the\nview that:\n\nThe risks of performance based contracts were too high when there was no proven\nprivate sector expertise in road maintenance.\n\nThere was no sufficiently good register of existing asset condition on which to base the\ncontracts.\n\nRTA staff continued to deliver maintenance on one of the two networks, thereby providing\n\neasy comparison of quality and price. Contracts were signed for two years.\n\nThe management contracts were structured on a \u201cCode of Practice\u201d. This determined the\n\ntechnical specifications and the intervention standards required of the managers.\n\nThe concerns of the RTA going into the contracts were all satisfied including:\n\nThe emergency response capability of the contractor.\n\nThe quality of the maintenance work.\n\nThe network management processes used by the maintenance manager (which in fact\nwere deemed to have improved on those of the RTA and have been adopted by them).\n\n\u2022 Ongoing maintenance of the assets and level of service over the life of the contracts.\n\nThe cost of the maintenance work. This was around 16 percent lower than cost of RTA\nmaintenance initially, though over the course of the contract the RTA costs fell by 22\npercent.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 45\n\nIn 1993, the RTA determined to re-bid the contracts for a further 2 years. Several bids were\nreceived,  though  the  incumbents  were  all  successful  in  retaining  their  contracts.  The  average\nprices fell again, and were 25 percent lower than on the first contracts.\n\nBy 1994, RTA confidence had grown such that it decided to embark on a performance\n\nbased form of contract. Its objectives were defined as:\n\n\u2022\n\nImproving the condition of its road assets and/or reducing total recurrent maintenance\ncosts.\n\n\u2022 Enhancing  and  developing  skills  in  the  road  industry  for  effective  management  and\n\ndelivery of road asset maintenance.\n\n\u2022 Equitably allocating risk between the RTA and contractors.\n\n\u2022 Developing  and  implementing  a  simply,  effective  contract  which  was  precise,\n\nmanageable and allowed \u201cpartnering\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Developing and encouraging appropriate innovating road maintenance practice.\n\nThe RTA wanted to see innovation in the bids and therefore specified little in the call for\n\n\u201cconcept proposals\u201d except:\n\nThe geographic extent (450km) of the network to be maintained under the contract. The\nnetwork was selected on the basis of allowing an acceptable cash flow which would\nalso minimize management and investment costs, and ensure a suitable distribution of\nconstruction  type,  age,  condition,  and  usage  to  minimize  the  risk  exposure  of  the\ncontractor.\n\nThe duration (between 5 and 15 years).\n\nThe current RTA maintenance budget for the network.\n\nThat a quality assurance form of contract was required.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe RTA also gave all interested parties details of the information that would be available to\n\nshort-listed bidders.\n\nFour bidders were then invited to submit contract proposals and were given 10 months in\n\nwhich to develop these. The minimum conditions that the RTA specified were only:\n\n\u2022\n\nInsurance requirements.\n\n\u2022 Provisions for safety and security access to the network.\n\n\u2022 Statutory reporting requirements.\n\nAll of the bids were reviewed by a panel from RTA which was supported by a consultant\n\nfrom an international management consulting firm. The bids were reviewed on the basis of:\n\n\u2022 Commercial benefits for the RTA and government\n\n\u2022\n\nThe level of asset and environmental protection provided.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 46\n\nThe incident management system.\n\nThe technical advantages of the system proposed.\n\nThe  extent  of  resource  transfer  from  the  RTA  to  the  contractor.  Prior  to  the\ncommencement  the  process,  staff  and  unions  had  been  informed  of  the  RTA\u2019s\nproposal, and it had been agreed that the contract would contain clauses dealing with\nthe transfer of appropriate staff and their conditions of employment under the new\ncontractor.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe technical and financial capability of the contractor.\n\nTransfield-Maintenance was selected as the preferred bidder and negotiated with the\n\ngovernment over seven months to arrive at a contract, which will be in place for 10 years.\n\nThe Conditions of the Contract are key to its structure as is the notion of \u201cFitness for Purpose\u201d.\nWithin the conditions of contract is the technical specification of maintenance standards required.\nThere are 51 asset classes, each defined and standards are set for:\n\nThe maintenance rationale.\n\nThe inspection plan.\n\nThe level of service required \u2014 which includes the limits of the contractors responsibility,\na quality management system, contract management and reporting and procedures\nfor change.\n\nThe intervention standards \u2014 which are a safety net to the fitness for purpose standard\nand specify response times depending on defect severity.\n\n\u2022 Any local variations.\n\nSince developing these standards for the performance contract RTA, have come to use\n\nthem as guidelines for all of its operation.\n\nThe contractor is awarded a base monthly fee for the contract (amounting to A$102 million\nover 10 years). This is paid on the base inventory of assets. Several commercial schedules were\nalso developed to allow for payment and penalties to be levied. These involve:\n\n\u2022 Rates for inventory adjustment.\n\n\u2022 Pavement model activity rates \u2014 the contract assumes maximum growth factors for\n\ntraffic and these are reviewed annually.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTraffic signal upgrade rates.\n\nLane occupancy fees.\n\n\u2022 Response time non-conformance deductions.\n\n\u2022 Management non-conformance deductions.\n\n\u2022 Cost  adjustments.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 47\n\n\u2022 An inventory adjustment threshold schedule \u2014 if new assets are added to the inventory\nit is the contracts duty to maintain them fit for purpose without payment, until\nthe yearly inventory review when the base payments will be adjusted to allow for\nthe addition.\n\n\u2022 Review schedules.\n\nThe  contract  defines  routine  and  major  maintenance  work  for  all  of  the  asset  types  \u2014\nmaking determinations on the basis of cost effectiveness. Work which is less likely to be required,\nbut is high in cost, tended not to be included in the routine maintenance work \u2014 in order to ensure\nthat the costs of the Transfield contract were not pushed up unreasonably.\n\nAs well as the basic maintenance services, Transfield is obliged to provide the following\n\nprovisional services:\n\n\u2022 Repair  of  damage  to  the  road  from  over  dimensioned  vehicles  operating  under\n\n\u2022 Restoration of excavation work by others.\n\nlicense.\n\n\u2022 Damage from motor vehicle accidents.\n\n\u2022 Vandalism, other than graffiti.\n\n\u2022\n\nForce majeure damage \u2014 defined as events with a lower than one in ten year probability\nof occurrence.\n\n\u2022 Repetitive traffic signal errors.\n\nSince these events are not in the control of either party, Transfield is obliged to provide the\nservices and then to invoice RTA directly. Additional services which become necessary during the\ncourse of the contract, but which neither side had foreseen, may be undertaken by Transfield if they\nare less than A$60,000 in value. Where the works will cost between A$60,000 and A$300,000 then\nRTA may ask Transfield to undertake the work, may call for bids or use RTA staff directly. Over\nA$300,000 RTA must either call for bids or use RTA staff.\n\nThere is a fully developed Quality Assurance regime including plans for:\n\n\u2022 Quality.\n\u2022 Contract management.\n\u2022 Environmental management.\n\u2022\nIncident response.\n\u2022 Community relations.\n\u2022 Asset management.\n\u2022 Occupational, health, safety and rehabilitation.\n\nFitness for purpose is measured against level of service provided on each asset. This is\nmeasured against such indicators as average roughness per link (for pavement) and condition\nindices for bridges. In order to measure these, Transfield is required to collect various data for the\nRTA on the asset inventory and condition, traffic volumes, truck weights and maintenance amounts\nand locations.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 48\n\nRTA and Transfield have entered into a \u201cpartnering\u201d arrangement. Both sides seek to address\nissues at the lowest possible managerial level and to address them swiftly. RTA has one manager\nof the contract (spending approximately 50 percent of his time) and one full time supervisor.\n\n2.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nThe New Zealand Government has privatized many of the managerial functions under its\nauspices. This has been a strategic decision to develop the private sector within the country and to\nreduce public sector involvement and has covered all sectors, including transport. Hence there is\nnow only a very small staff within the Ministry of Transport. The ministry relies on two larger bodies\nto manage its work \u2014 Transit (which plans, maintains and manages the network) and Transfund\n(which controls the funds).\n\nThere are 90,000 km of roads in New Zealand, in which the Government makes an annual\ninvestment of NZ$0.4 billion per year. Transit manages the state highway network of 10,300 kms.\nApproximately half of its expenditure goes towards construction and emergency works, 16 percent\nto preventive maintenance and 35 percent to routine maintenance.\n\na.\n\nMaintenance  Management  Contracts\n\nTransit undertakes little of the construction or maintenance work in-house. There are instead,\n24  professional  management  contracts,  with  a  maximum  contract  period  of  3  years.  These\nmanagement  contractors  oversee  the  physical  work  done  by  the  maintenance  contractors  (for\nwhich there are 220 contracts). The maintenance contractors are typically paid on unit rates for the\ncompletion of work and the managers through a lump sum payment on completion of the service.\nThe savings from this contracting-out saved Transit around 17 percent of the total cost. However,\nthe system was perceived to have some disadvantages:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  short  contracts  meant  that  maintenance  work  was  undertaken  to  last  for  three\nyears \u2014 no consideration was given to life costs.\n\n\u2022 Several contractors did not perform to time and budget which meant expensive litigation.\n\nThere  has  been  an  adversarial  relationship  between  government,  management\ncontractors and maintenance suppliers.\n\nAs  a  result,  Transit  has  begun  a  trial  program  of  performance-specified  maintenance\ncontracts combining the physical works and the professional management services. The payment\nfor these contracts is on output specifications with the contractors determining how the work is\nundertaken. Lump-sum payments are made at the end of 10 years, if the required condition has\nbeen delivered. Contractors are required to develop their own quality management systems to\ndemonstrate that they are complying with the contract. It is hoped that the trial will:\n\n\u2022 Remove administrative costs in servicing the periodic contracts.\n\n\u2022 Encourage physical contractors and the managers to work as a team.\n\n\u2022\n\nForce the contractor to consider a longer horizon and thereby produce higher quality\nwork.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 49\n\n\u2022 Promote innovation.\n\nThe trial is to be staged, over two networks (representing approximately 10 percent of the\nNew Zealand road network and NZ$9 million per year). The first tender is due to be let in December\n1998,  through  a  competitive  bidding  procedure,  in  which  there  will  be  a  quality/price  trade  off.\nConforming bids must be submitted but bidders may also submit alternatives.\n\nThere  has  been  some  concern  from  the  existing  local  contractors  that  international\ncontractors will be attracted and that the small contractors may lose out because of the size of the\ncontracts. There is also some concern that the contractors will not be able to perform the self-\nmonitoring role.\n\nb.\n\nBOT  Projects\n\nThere are no BOT road projects in New Zealand. Two potential BOT projects are Second\n\nHarbour Crossing and South Eastern Arterial Route Scheme in Auckland.\n\nHowever a BOT project would require legal changes to allow the private sector to charge\n\nand collect tolls.\n\nc.\n\nCorporatization\n\nCurrently New Zealand is considering corporatization of their road network, following a report\nfrom the \u201cRoading Advisory Group\u201d published in November 1997. The Roading Advisory Group\nsaw the concerns with the existing road system management as:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe lack of a direct relationship between road pricing and use \u2014 pricing is currently\nthrough a fuel tax (9.5c of which goes directly into a road fund the rest to the exchequer),\nvehicle registration charges, and road user charges levied on larger vehicles according\nto weight and usage.\n\nThe lack of a direct relationship between road providers and users.\n\nThe lack of commercial incentives to invest in road infrastructure.\n\nHowever the Government objective that the highways must remain in public ownership has\nbeen  taken  into  account  and  hence  the  recommended  corporatization  of  the  road  network  by\ntransferring the assets held by Transit and the local authorities into the hands of road companies\nwhich \u201cshould be financially viable\u201d. The road companies would own corridors or defined networks,\nfor  which  they  would  be  fully  responsible  \u2014  in  terms  of  maintenance,  safety,  environmental\nmanagement, user relations, and pricing. Each user would be required to pay the actual cost of\ntheir use of the road system, and the road companies would be fully responsible for price setting\nand would charge directly for road use at the local level.\n\nJ.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThere are 7,000 km of road in the South African national road network, and some 660 km of\nthat are presently tolled, at 18 toll plazas. BOT projects have not been the normal \u201cmodus operandi\u201d\nuntil the last few years \u2014 instead most roads were operated for the Government under management\ncontracts (with fixed terms of between 3 and 5 years).\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 50\n\nHowever,  the  current  policy  is  for  all  new  toll  road  projects  to  be  undertaken  under  the  BOT\nmechanism and to be fully privately funded over 30 years.\n\n1.\n\nN4 Motorway\n\nThe N4 project is a cross border, concessioned toll road, from Maputo in Mozambique to\nWitbank in South Africa, and is the first BOT road for either country. There is an existing road for\n390 km, which will be upgraded substantially and a further 50 km must be built. The existing traffic\non the road is fairly low, but expected to increase with the upgrading. There will be no parallel free\nroad \u2014 in most places, although there has been some political backlash, particularly in middle\nclass towns in South Africa, where protests have forced local politicians to offer improved facilities\non the adjacent roads.\n\nHaving called for bids in 1995, and short-listed three consortia in 1996, the concession\nagreement was signed in May 1997 with the TRAC consortium which includes the Bouygues\ngroup and two local contractors. Both countries signed the 30-year concession agreement,\nwhich added legal complexity because of their different national legislation. With Bouygues\u2019\nencouragement,  the  Hungarian  M5  concession  model,  was  used  as  the  basis  of  the  N4\nagreement. This means that some of the complexities of the Hungarian model (some of which\nwere  necessary  only  because  of  the  specifics  of  Hungarian  legal  practices)  have  been\nduplicated.\n\nThe TRAC consortium has agreed a fixed price, fixed time design and construction contract\nwith SSB, a joint venture of Bouygues, Basil Read and Stock Roads (all part of TRAC). Construction\nhas been phased over 3.5 years and began in January 1998.\n\nFinancial closure was reached within seven months of signing the concession agreement.\nDebt of US$308 million has been raised. US$68 million of equity will be drawn down over the life of\nthe project to maintain a 80:20 debt/equity ratio. Up to 40 percent of the equity is held by the sponsors.\nDevelopment Bank of South Africa was one of the chief arrangers of the financing. Some of the\nupside potential has been shared with the two governments.\n\nThere are 5 toll plazas along the road, three in RSA and two in Mozambique but none at\nthe border. The RSA plazas are expected to open within 18 months of the start of the contract but\nthe others not until the end of the construction period. The location of each plaza has caused\npolitical concern. In Mozambique one toll plaza is located to capture commuting traffic into Maputo.\nIn South Africa, as already mentioned, there has been some political intervention by the mining\ncommunities of Witbank and Middleburg, just outside Pretoria, which resulted in the upgrading of\nthe parallel \u201cfree\u201d road.\n\nThere are level of service criteria in the concession agreement, and future expansions\nare envisaged if traffic grows. TRAC has certain pre-emptive rights over services alongside the\nroad.\n\nThe N4 is one of several initiatives being undertaken in the corridor, including an upgrade\nof the rail link from the border to the port. The development of the corridor is being promoted by\nboth  countries  through  the  Maputo  Corridor  Company,  and  supported  by  the  South  African\nDevelopment Bank.\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 51\n\n2.\n\nOther  Concessions  under  Development\n\nTwo other road BOT projects are currently under development in South Africa:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe N3 Heidelberg - Cedara (part of the road between Johannesburg and Durban). 110\nkm of new road is required and 60 km of upgrading from a single to a dual carriageway.\nBids have been submitted.\n\nThe N4 West Platinum Toll Road from Pretoria to the RSNBotswana border which will\nbe 380 km long. The shortlist has been prepared and the preferred tenderer is to be\nselected  in  November  1998.  The  road  is  the  last  link  in  the  East-West  international\nhighway linking Walvis Bay in Namibia with Maputo in Mozambique.\n\n3.  Operators\n\nThe South African firm, Intertoll, has become a major international toll road operator, having\nstarted in RSA in 1 984 to undertake management contracts for the DOT. In 1992, the company\nstarted to diversify and took on its first concession project in Hungary in 1993 (the M5). It has since\nentered into joint venture agreements\n\n\fAppendix 3, page 1\n\nBOT PROJECT DATABASE SUMMARY\n\nCountry\n\nOpen Construction\n\nPre-Planning\n\nAbandoned\n\nTotal\n\nPROJECT

The study was financed through a $600,000 regional\ntechnical assistance grant - RETA 5753: Developing Best Practices for Promoting Private Sector\nInvestment in Infrastructure. This report focuses on the road sector; the other reports cover the\npower, water supply, airport and air traffic control, and port sectors.\n", "Transport is central to achieving prosperity and the quality of life, to which all countries\naspire.  Transport  policy  has  pervasive  impacts:  on  economic  performance;  on  the  shape  and\nstructure  of  human  settlements  through  its  impact  upon  physical  development  and  economic\nstructures;  on  the  distribution  of  income;  and  on  the  environment.  This  report  develops  best\npractices for promoting private sector investment in the road sector. It defines the objectives of\nprivate  sector  participation,  reviews  experiences  of  private  sector  participation  in  Asia  and\nelsewhere, examines the degree of success that has been achieved to date, and identifies the\nkey issues that provide the basis for determining best practices. In addition, the report discusses\nADB\u2019s role in facilitating both private sector participation and competition in the road sector. It is\nhoped  that  the  report  will  help  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  successfully  attract  well\nmanaged and cost-effective private investment.\n", "The five reports have benefited from the support of and valuable contributions from many\nindividuals,  both  inside  and  outside  ADB.  The  reports  were  prepared  by  a  team  of  individual\nconsultants: Water Supply - Michael Porter of Tasman Asia Pacific; Power - Elliot Roseman of\nPricewaterhouseCoopers; Ports - John Arnold, an independent ports specialist; Airports and Air\nTraffic Control - Ian Jones of National Economic Research Associates; and Roads - Roger\nAllport  of  Halcrow  Fox.  In  ADB,  Sean  O\u2019Sullivan,  Senior  Public/Private  Sector  Specialist\nmanaged  the  technical  assistance  implementation  with  the  help  of  Marcelo  Minc,  Project\nEconomist. ADB staff in the Energy; Transport and Communications; and Water Supply, Urban\nDevelopment and Housing Divisions as well as the Private Sector Group helped in guiding the\ndirection of the study and in reviewing the outputs. In December 1998, a workshop, hosted by\nADB as an integral component of the study, provided a forum for the exchange of ideas and\nexperiences.  Participation  and  contributions  of  delegates  from  many  developing  member\ncountries  and  representatives  from  the  private  sector  in  the  workshop  were  very  much\nappreciated by ADB.\n", "The publication of the five reports is especially timely as it coincides with the introduction\n", "of a new strategy for private sector development by ADB.\n", "Vladimir
