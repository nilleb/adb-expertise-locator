INTRODUCTION \nThis paper provides an assessment of the labor market and social impacts of the financial \nand economic crisis in Asia and the Pacific and reviews national policy responses to the \ncrisis. It highlights some policy options available to governments confronting the crisis that \nare likely to generate employment, improve social welfare on the basis of decent work \nprinciples, and promote a sound economic and labor market recovery.  \nSection 2 provides an analysis of the impact of the crisis on the region\u2019s economies along \nwith the key channels through which the crisis is being transmitted. It examines economic \ngrowth trends in 2008 and projections for 2009. Section 3 assesses the employment and \nsocial consequences of the crisis, including falling demand for labor, the more salient trend \nof rising vulnerable and informal employment, and falling incomes and their pressures on the \nworking poor. As the recovery in the labor market is likely to lag behind output growth, the \nsection  examines  this  issue  by  looking  back at the  experience  of  Asian  labor markets \nfollowing the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The section identifies the most vulnerable groups \nand provides some scenarios regarding impacts on unemployment, vulnerable employment, \nworking poverty, and labor productivity in 2009. \nSection 4 provides an overview of the size and composition of fiscal stimulus measures in \nselected economies in developing Asia. The section assesses fiscal stimulus responses in \nterms of their nature (direct and indirect) and temporal impact (short and long term) and the \nneed to combine measures that enhance short-term demand as well as long-term growth. \nThe paper concludes with Section 5, a brief review of some critical issues and policy options \nto maximize the positive economic, employment, and social outcomes of the fiscal stimulus \nmeasures in developing Asia, including in the areas of public investment and infrastructure \nexpenditure, social transfers to the poor and vulnerable, global and regional coordination of \nfiscal  policy  responses,  employment  and  social  protection  policies,  and  support  for \nenterprises and environmental sustainability.  \n2.  THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS IN \nASIA AND THE PACIFIC \n2.1  Economic Impact and Forecast \nWhile many Asian economies continued to grow very rapidly in 2008, recent data indicate \nthat the region is under significant stress from the global economic crisis. Economic growth \nin  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region  declined  to  5.1%  in  2008,  down  from  8.0%  in  2007 \n(International Monetary Fund [IMF] World Economic Outlook Database April 2009). Asia\u2019s \ndeveloping  economies  fared  far  better  than  the  region\u2019s  industrialized  economies.  In \ndeveloping Asia, growth declined to a still robust 7.7% in 2008, down from very rapid growth \nof 10.6% in 2007, while, in the region\u2019s newly industrialized economies, growth slowed to \n1.5%\u2014less than one third the rate of 5.7% achieved the previous year.1 And growth in \nJapan plunged to -0.6% in 2008, down from 2.4% in 2007.  \nAnnual figures fail, however, to reveal how suddenly the crisis emerged. Most developing \neconomies in Asia and the Pacific initially saw only moderate deceleration in growth. But, as \nthe crisis intensified and demand sharply slowed in the United States, European Union, and \nJapan, a substantial decline in economic activity took place in many Asian economies in the \n                                                \n1 The \u201cdeveloping Asia\u201d region is an IMF regional grouping and is comprised of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Kiribati, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMaldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, \nThailand, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam. The \u201cnewly industrialized Asian economies\u201d region is comprised of \nHong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nclosing months of the year and in the first quarter of 2009. In the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), growth slowed to 6.1% in the first quarter of 2009, down sharply from 10.6% in the \nfirst quarter of 2008 (China National Bureau of Statistics 2009). In the Republic of Korea \n(hereafter Korea), growth tumbled from 5.5 to -4.3% (Korea National Statistical Office 2009), \nand in Singapore output plummeted from 6.7% to \u201311.5% over the same period (Singapore \nDepartment of Statistics 2009). Meanwhile, growth in Thailand dropped from 6.0% in the first \nquarter of 2008 to \u20137.1% in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting both contraction in external \ndemand and heightened political instability (Thailand Office of the National Economic and \nSocial Development Board 2009a). \nBy April 2009, the outlook for Asia and the Pacific had deteriorated significantly (Figure 1). \nCurrent forecasts indicate that economic growth in the region as a whole will drop to only \n1.4% in 2009, down sharply from 5.1% in 2008 and the very rapid growth rate of 8% \nachieved in 2007. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) prediction in October 2008 that the \nregion would grow by 5.6% in 2009 highlights the rapid and substantial deterioration that has \ntaken place. \nFigure 1: Annual Real Gross Domestic Product Growth Rates, 2007 and 2009 \n(forecast) (in %) \n14\n12\n2007 2009\n11.2\n10\n8\n8.0\n6 6.6 7.0\n4\n4.0 4.3\n2 2.7\n2.0\n1.4\n0\n-0.7\n-2 -2.8\n-4.2\n-4\n-6\n-8\nUnited States Euro area Asia-Pacific East Asia South East Asia & South Asia\nthe Pacific\n \nNote: Subregional country groups are provided in Table A.1 in the appendix. \nSource: IMF 2009. IMF: World Economic Outlook database (April 2009). \nAsia\u2019s  developed  economies  have  seen  the  largest  shock  to  economic  growth.  The \ndeveloped economies of Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are, together, projected to \nshrink by 5.4% this year. The export-dependent Southeast Asia and Pacific subregion is \nprojected to shrink by \u20130.7%, with a steep decline of \u201310% forecast for Singapore, \u20137.5% for \nTaipei,China, \u20133.5% for Malaysia, and \u20133% for Thailand. East Asia and South Asia are \nexpected to fare comparatively better, with growth of 4.0% and 4.3% respectively. This \nresilience is due to a number of factors, ranging from less reliance on exports in many South \nAsian economies to the PRC\u2019s large fiscal stimulus package to boost domestic demand. \nGrowth is expected to rebound in the region in 2010 and beyond, with a current forecast of \n4.2% regional economic growth in 2010, with modestly positive growth of 0.5% forecast for \nthe developed economies in Asia, growth of 2.2% predicted for Southeast Asia and the \nPacific, growth of 5.0% for South Asia, and growth of 6.1% for East Asia. \n2 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \n2.2  Key Transmission Mechanisms to Asian Economies \nThere  are  a  number  of  ways  in  which  the  current  crisis  is  being  transmitted  to  Asian \neconomies.  Understanding  the  specific  mechanisms  through  which  industries  and \neconomies are affected is essential for assessing the likely labor market impacts and for \ndesigning appropriate policies to mitigate the adverse effects.  \nExports have played a major role in Asia\u2019s phenomenal growth, with many Asian economies \nhighly reliant on exports to earn foreign currency and fuel domestic development. Heading \ninto  the  crisis,  the  value  of  manufacturing  exports  equaled  more  than  140%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in Singapore, nearly 70% in Malaysia, more than 40% in Cambodia \nand Thailand, and more than 30% in the PRC, Korea, Philippines, and Viet Nam. At the \nother end of the spectrum, manufacturing exports make up less than 10% of the GDP in \nIndia and Pakistan and only around 11% in Indonesia (Figure A.1 in the appendix). \nAs consumers in developed economies abruptly cut back on spending in 2008 and the \nbeginning of 2009, demand for Asia\u2019s exports fell sharply (Figure 2). In April 2009, exports \nfrom the PRC fell by 23% and from Thailand by 25%. Similarly, March 2009 export data from \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines indicated a year-on-year drop of 26\u201332%. Sales of \nlabor-intensive manufacturing products including toys, games, footwear, and clothing are \ndown sharply in the United States and Europe, as are sales of higher value-added goods \nsuch as computers and related equipment and automobiles (James et al. 2008). As total \nworld trade volumes are expected to contract in 2009 by 11% (IMF 2009), this important \nsource of growth in many Asian economies is unlikely to recover soon.  \nAccordingly, many Asian firms are sharply cutting production, causing an unmistakable rise \nin factory closures. After having plummeted in late 2008 and early 2009, industrial production \nhas recently shown early signs of recovery in some economies such as the PRC and \nIndonesia, but factory output remains depressed in Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. \nFigure 2: Year-on-year Change in Industrial Production and Exports,  \nmost recent month (%) \n \n \nNote: Data are April 2009 for the People\u2019s Republic of China and Thailand and March 2009 for other economies. \nSources: National statistical offices. \n3 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nForeign direct investment (FDI) has been an important contributor to growth in many Asian \neconomies, allowing them to move up the value chain through increased access to capital \nand  to  more  advanced  technologies.  As  a  share  of  gross  fixed  capital  formation,  FDI \ncomprises some 60% in Singapore, 52% in Cambodia, more than 40% in Fiji, and 25% in \nViet Nam (Figure A.2). FDI accounts for a large share of capital formation also in Malaysia, \nPakistan, Thailand, and Philippines. In 2008, growth in FDI turned negative in several Asian \neconomies,  including  Indonesia,  Singapore,  and  Thailand  (UNCTAD  2009).  Current \nestimates are that global FDI to developing countries will shrink by more than 30% in 2009, \nand, while Asia and the Pacific may continue to outperform other developing regions with \nregard to attracting FDI, the chance is slim that the region can avoid a decline in foreign \ninvestment (Lui 2009). In Cambodia, for example, FDI in 2009 is forecast to contract to \nUS$390 million, about half the amount in 2008 (World Bank 2009).  \nAs migrant workers\u2019 incomes are at risk in the current economic downturn, so too are \nremittances, which are a vital source of income and foreign exchange for many Asian \neconomies, particularly for poor households. Remittances comprise one-third of GDP in \nTonga, 11% in the Philippines, and 5%\u201310% in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Viet Nam, and \nMongolia (Figure A.3). \nRemittance flows to developing economies began to slow in the third quarter of 2008, and \nthe World Bank now forecasts an overall fall in remittances to these economies in 2009 of \napproximately 5% (Ratha and Mohapatra 2009). Compounding reduced remittances, official \naid flows are likely to be affected by tighter budgets in advanced economies. This is likely to \nadd  pressure  in  the  region\u2019s  least-developed  economies  to  government  budget  items \ndirected toward economic development and poverty reduction. \n3.  LABOR MARKET AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF \nTHE CRISIS \nIt is important to emphasize that the labor market and social impacts of the crisis will differ by \neconomy depending on their context and, within each economy, by household and group. A \ndetailed analysis of each economy and group is beyond the scope of this paper, but a few \ncommon patterns and particularly vulnerable groups emerge from the data. \n3.1  Job Losses \nThe first of these patterns is worsening job losses. Despite efforts to avoid retrenchment, \nthere has been a significant increase in job losses, particularly in terms of a reduction in \nwage employment. The most recent national data indicate a significant employment impact \nin the manufacturing sector for a number of economies. As expected, millions of workers in \nkey export industries in the region have been retrenched. Many of these workers were \nemployed  in  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  that  supply  larger  firms  in  national, \nregional, and global production chains.  \nIn the PRC, job losses from large factory closures\u2014caused not only the crisis but also by \nindustrial restructuring to higher value-added production prior to the crisis\u2014have forced \nmore than 20 million retrenched workers to return to the countryside in pursuit of rural \nemployment.2 In Malaysia, the number of retrenched workers totaled 12,600 in the first \n                                                \n2 The government of the PRC recently stated that around 20 million internal migrant workers\u2014more than 15% of the estimated 130 million \ninternal migrant workers\u2014lost their jobs in recent months. While many of these workers will take up some form of employment to offset lost \nincome and therefore not be unemployed in the statistical sense, this figure is indicative of a rapid decline in labor demand and the reality of rising \nunemployment and underemployment, reduced hours, and weakening job security (Johnson and Batson 2009). See: Ian Johnson and Andrew \nBatson: \u201cChina\u2019s Migrants See Jobless Ranks Soar\u201d, The Wall Street Journal, 3 February 2009. \n4 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nquarter  of  2009  (Ministry  of  Human  Resources  2009).3 While  the  absolute  number  of \nretrenched workers may be small, it is nearly a fourfold increase from the 2008 average \nquarterly number of retrenched workers of 3,460. More than three-fourths of the retrenched \nworkers in the first quarter of 2009 were in manufacturing.  \nThe Indonesian Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration reported that job losses exceeded \n51,000, while the Indonesian Employers Association reported over 237,000 layoffs between \nOctober 2008 and March 2009, with the textile and garment sector accounting for the bulk of \nthem,  followed  by  palm  oil  plantations,  automotive  and  spare  parts,  construction,  and \nfootwear (Tempo Interactive 2009; Jakarta Post 2009). In Cambodia, employment in the \ngarment sector contracted by 15% between September 2008 and February 2009 (Jalilian \n2009). In Thailand, the number of people on unemployment insurance rose by 17.2% in \nJanuary 2009 alone, after rising by 38.3% in 2008 over the previous year (Thailand Office of \nNational Economic and Social Development Board 2009b). \nJob  losses  in  different  industries  combined  with  stalled  new  recruitment  are  pushing \nunemployment  rates  up  in  some  Asian  economies  (Table  1).  In  the  Philippines,  the \nunemployment  rate  increased  to  7.7%  in  January  2009  from  7.4%  in  January  2008, \nrepresenting a 6.7% rise in the number of unemployed people. Meanwhile, the number of \nunemployed increased by 28.7% in Singapore between March 2008 and March 2009 and a \nstaggering 73.3% in Thailand in the same period. By contrast, the Indonesian unemployment \nrate in February 2009 was lower than a year earlier. This apparently favorable trend is more \nnuanced, however, if one takes into the account the accompanying trend of a shift to \ninformal and vulnerable employment\u2014another major pattern that is discussed in section 3.2. \n                                                \n3 From the number of layoffs reported between 1 October 2008 and 14 May 2009, it appears that around 75% of retrenchments are permanent, \nwhile 25% of retrenchments took place under voluntary separation schemes.   \n5 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \n \nTable 1: Unemployment Rate and Number of unemployed, selected Asian countries,  \n2008\u201309 \n \nNumber of  Number of  Change in \nUnemployment  Unemployment  unemployed,  unemployed,  number of \nrate,  rate,  early 2008  early 2009  unemployed \n  early 2008  early 2009  (\u2019000)  (\u2019000)  (%) \n                                             \nIndonesia  8.5  8.1  9,430  9,260   (1.8)  \n                                                    \nJapan  4.0  5.0  2,650  3,340         26.0  \nKorea, \nRepublic                                                            \nof  3.2  3.7  787  933         18.6  \n                                                    \nPhilippines  7.4  7.7  2,675  2,855           6.7  \n                                                              \nSingapore  1.9  3.2  55   96         73.3  \n                                                              \nThailand  1.7  2.1  606   780         28.7  \n( ) = negative. \nNote: Early 2008 and 2009 refers to the month of February for Indonesia, April for Japan \nand Republic of Korea, January for the Philippines, and March for Singapore and \nThailand. \nSources: National statistical offices. \nSubcontract, casual, and temporary workers are often the most vulnerable to initial factory \njob cuts. Shedding these workers is easier and less costly than laying off regular staff. \nOccasionally, regulations relating to the termination of employment are not observed. More \nimportantly, many non-regular female and male workers do not receive or qualify for the \nseverance  pay  or  unemployment  benefits  to  which  their  regular  counterparts  are  often \nentitled (Charoensuthipan 2009; Pitsuwan 2008).  \nGender-disaggregated analyses indicate that women are likely to be harder hit by rising \nunemployment than are men. In Thailand, female employment in manufacturing decreased \nby nearly 130,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008 from the previous year, representing 63.2% \nof total job contraction in that industry (Thailand National Statistics Office 2009). This reflects \nin part the large share of women workers in key sectors that are hit by the crisis. Many of the \nexport industries such as textiles, garments, and electronics are labor intensive and use \nmostly women workers, making them extremely vulnerable. Prior to the current crisis, there \nwere  2\u20134  times  more  women  than  men  in  the  textiles  and  garments  industries  in  the \nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, and 5.3 times more women than men in the electronics \nindustry in the Philippines (Dejardin and Owens 2009).  \nFurther, youths are likely to be disproportionately affected by rising unemployment. Even in \n2008, youths in Asia were more than three times as likely as older adults to be unemployed. \nIn Southeast Asia, the youth unemployment rate stood at 15% in 2008. This figure could rise \nsharply, as young workers with little job tenure are likely to be among the first to be let go, \nwhile first-time jobseekers are likely to find themselves at a substantial disadvantage when \ncompeting against a rising pool of more experienced (and recently unemployed) jobseekers \nfor increasingly scarce jobs. In the Philippines, the number of unemployed youths in January \n2009 increased by 5.9% to 1.4 million more than in the previous year (Philippines National \nStatistics Office 2009). Similarly, in Japan, the year-on-year increase in the number of \n6 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nunemployed  youths  in April  2009  soared  by  23.4%,  or  an  increase  of  110,000  (Japan \nStatistics Bureau). \nMoreover, in the PRC, an estimated 6.1 million new college graduates will enter the labor \nmarket in 2009, joining the 4 million from previous years who are still seeking employment \n(Economist 2009; Lawrence 2008). Rising and/or longer-term unemployment among youths \nnot only causes the immediate waste of productive potential, it threatens to stymie the \nyouths\u2019 productivity at later stages in their careers and thereby constrain productivity and \noutput growth in the medium and long term. \nThe bleak economic outlook for 2009 means there is very little chance that a sufficient \nnumber of new jobs will be created in the region this year to keep up with expected labor \nforce growth. Over 2009 and 2010, an estimated 51 million additional jobs will be needed to \nabsorb Asia\u2019s growing labor force, with the largest numbers of jobs needed in Asia\u2019s most \npopulous  economies:  20.3  million  in  India,  10.9  million  in  the  PCR,  and  3.6  million  in \nIndonesia. The largest rates of labor force growth in 2008\u20132010 are expected in Pakistan \n(6.1%), Cambodia (4.9%), and Philippines (4.9%) (Figure A.4). As the crisis is likely to \nsubstantially decelerate economic growth in these economies, labor market pressures will \nintensify. \nAnother  vulnerable  group  that  has  been  severely  affected  by  the  global  crisis  are \ninternational migrant workers, who are often among the first to be dismissed during an \neconomic downturn (Abella and Ducanes 2009).4 Many overseas migrant workers are not \nretained upon the expiration of their contract and are expected to return home. However, \nmigrant workers and local nationals often fill different segments of the labor market, and thus \nrepatriating  migrants  may  simply  leave  certain  types  of  jobs  unfilled  despite  economic \ncontraction. Further, the combination of returning migrant workers and decreased demand \nfor migrant workers from developing Asia can exacerbate the challenge of mitigating job \nlosses and generating new employment in labor-exporting economies.5  \nRather than laying workers off, some companies have resorted to reducing working hours or \nplacing employees on unpaid leave. For some groups, however, such changes can be even \nmore detrimental as they do not qualify for unemployment benefits or other government \nprograms for the retrenched, and their incomes fall below the minimum wage. \n3.2  Vulnerable and Informal Employment \nA  larger  adjustment  to  retrenchments  in  developing  Asia  is  the  shift  to  informal  and \nvulnerable  employment.  Where  poverty  is  high  and  social  safety  nets  are  inadequate, \nworkers who lose formal wage employment frequently are left with few alternatives except \nlower paying and informal work. One useful indicator that is likely to capture this potential \nshift from more formal, wage employment to less formal economic activities is \u201cvulnerable \nemployment,\u201d  which  is  defined  as  the  sum  of  own-account  workers  and  unpaid  family \nworkers (ILOb 2009).6 Many such workers in developing economies\u2014and sometimes in \ndeveloped economies as well\u2014do not enjoy social protection in case of job loss, personal or \nfamily illness, or other difficulties. They are less likely than formal wage employees to \nreceive adequate income or have their fundamental labor rights respected.  \n                                                \n4 For further discussion, see: Section 1 and Manolo Abella and Geoffrey Ducanes: The Effect of the Global Economic Crisis on Asian Migrant \nWorkers and Government Responses, ILO Technical Note (Bangkok, ILO, 2009). \n5 Migration flows from developing countries may slow as a result of the global economic crisis (Ratha, Mohapatra, and Xu 2008). see: Dilip Ratha, Sanket Mohapatra and \nZhimei Xu: Outlook for Remittance Flows 2008-2010: Growth expected to moderate significantly, but flows to remain resilient, Migration and Development Brief No. 8 \n(Washington, DC, World Bank, November 2008). \n6 For a discussion of this definition of vulnerable employment, refer to ILO: Global Employment Trends: January 2009 (Geneva, 2009), p. 14. It must be noted that wage \nworkers (employees) can also carry a high economic risk\u2014particularly casual wage workers and workers on temporary contracts, who are often the first to be dismissed \nin downsizing. \n7 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nRecent official data in Indonesia and Thailand corroborate the expansion of vulnerable \nemployment. In Indonesia, the number of employees expanded by only 1.4% from February \n2008 to February 2009, while the number of employers did not change much. On the other \nhand, growth in the number of workers whose employment status is considered vulnerable \noutpaced growth in wage employment during the same period. In particular, the number of \ncasual workers not in agriculture increased by 7.3%. In Thailand, first quarter 2009 figures \nindicate that the number of wage employees grew by 104,000, or 0.6%, solely as a result of \nexpanded  government  employment.  Meanwhile,  the  number  of  own-account  and \ncontributing family workers combined increased by an astounding 566,000 over the previous \nyear, or by 3.2% for own-account and 3.3% for contributing family workers. \nTable 2: Recent trends in employment status, Indonesia and Thailand \n  Indonesia  Thailand \nFeb 2008  Feb 2009  Change  Q1 2008  Q1 2009  Change \n  (millions)  (millions)  (%)  (millions)  (millions)  (%) \nEmployees  28.52  28.91  1.37  17.10  17.21  0.61 \nEmployers  24.58  24.61  0.00  1.04  1.04  0.55 \n   with permanent workers  2.98  2.97  -0.34  -  -   \n   with temporary workers  21.60  21.64  0.19  -  -  - \nOwn-account workers  20.08  20.81  3.64  11.20  11.55  3.17 \nCasual workers  10.93  11.50  5.22  -  -  - \n   in agriculture  6.13  6.35  3.59  -  -  - \n   not in agriculture  4.80  5.15  7.29  -  -  - \nUnpaid workers  17.94  18.66  4.01  6.41  6.62  3.29 \nOthers  -  -  -  0.07  0.08  9.88 \nTotal  102.05  104.49  2.39  35.82  36.50  1.91 \n( ) = negative, Q = quarter. \nNote: Others category in Thailand includes members of producers\u2019 cooperatives.  \nSources: Labour force surveys of Statistics Indonesia and Thailand\u2019s National Statistics Office. \nAlthough the main transmission channels have primarily affected urban labor markets, the \nconsequent effect on the rural economy, employment, and household income should not be \nignored. In many parts of developing Asia, job losses in export manufacturing have affected \nrural-to-urban migrants and their ability to support their rural families. For those retrenched \nworkers  unable  to  find  new  urban  employment,  seeking  rural  work  is  often  the  only \nremaining option. Reverse migration has taken place throughout the region, most notably in \nIndia and Viet Nam. The PRC, the factory of the world, has experienced unprecedented \nlabor  market  pressures,  as  approximately  20  million  migrant  workers  who  lost  jobs  in \nfactories and cities have returned to their home villages. To support themselves and their \nfamilies, many of these returnees are likely to take informal work, given their lower skills and \neducational qualifications.7 \nOverseas migrant workers face the same circumstances or even worse. These workers, \nparticularly newly arrived migrants, have in many cases invested heavily in getting recruited, \ntraveling to a foreign country, and establishing themselves there Abella and Ducanes 2009). \nAs a consequence, returning to their home country is often not an option, and they may \naccept almost any terms just to retain their jobs. In cases where they have lost their jobs and \nwork permits, they become undocumented and may turn to the informal or shadow economy.  \n                                                \n7 According to a recent report, 95% of returning migrant workers are unskilled and have low educational qualifications (Johnson and Batson 2009; \nRabinovitch 2008).

At that time, the number of household businesses in rural and peri-urban Thailand \nnearly tripled, but the heads of these businesses tended to be less educated and businesses \nhad a median start-up capital of B1,250 (approximately US$50), or a mere 3.4% of the \nmedian start-up capital for businesses started before the crisis (Paulson and Townsend \n2008). Moreover, businesses founded after the crisis, in 1999\u20132001, had median profits \nclose to zero, which was notably lower than the profits of those founded before the crisis \n(1992\u201397)  and  during  the  crisis  (1998),  suggesting  that  adverse  effects  on  the  most \nvulnerable are likely to linger even after economic recovery. \n                                                \n8 If the proportion of women and men in vulnerable employment were equal, data points in Figure 3 would fall on the 45 degree line. \n9 Research in urban China suggests that women\u2019s job-search efforts are handicapped by a lack of social \nnetworks,  unequal  entitlement  to  social  reemployment  services,,  and  other  factors,  causing  them  to  be \nunemployed longer (Du and Dong 2009) . See: Fenglian Du and Xiao-yuan Dong: \u201cWhy do women have longer \ndurations of unemployment than men in post-restructuring China?\u201d, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 33(2), pp. \n233-252. \n10 For a discussion on dualism in the informal economy, namely easy-entry versus upper-tier informal activities, \nsee: Gary S.

A great deal of uncertainty remains as to how the current crisis will affect \noverall levels of poverty and working poverty in Asia, but some possible scenarios are \npresented  in  the  next  section.  A  tremendous  impact  will  likely  be  felt  by  workers  and \nhouseholds who have climbed just barely above the poverty line in recent years with new \nformal employment and are now very vulnerable to falling back into poverty as a result of the \ncrisis. More than 52 million workers currently live just 10% above the extreme poverty line of \nUS$1.25/day, while more than 140 million live just 20% above that line (ILO 2008d). \nThere is already evidence of falling incomes and increasing vulnerability to working poverty \nin Asia. In India, prices for recyclable waste that unskilled workers collect and sell to scrap \nshops fell in many cases by 50% between October 2008 and January 2009 (Table 3). A \nsurvey of unskilled workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, revealed that real earnings have \ndecreased considerably in 2009 compared with 2007, falling by over 20% for cyclo drivers, \nsmall traders, motor-taxi drivers, and other unskilled workers (Jalilian 2009). Another study \non the impacts of the crisis in Cambodia projected the potential loss in real income due to \nthe crisis to reach US$677 million in 2009, affecting the incomes of 217,000 households, or \nover 1 million people (Chandararot et al. 2009). Given the large number of people clustered \naround  the  poverty  line  in  many  Asian  countries,  income  and  wage  reductions  of  the \nmagnitude witnessed for the specific jobs described above will have hugely detrimental \neffects on working poverty if they broaden to other parts of the economy. \nTable 3: Prices of Waste in Ahmedabad, India \n(Indian rupees per unit) \nType of Waste  October 2008  January 2009 \nSteel/Iron     \n   Nuts, bolts, screws  25  15 \n   Waste steel  6  3 \nPlastic bags   \n   Type 1  18  6 \n   Type 2  8  5\u20136 \nPaper     \n   Brown paper  3  2 \n   Newspaper  8  4 \nHard plastic   \n   Type 1  15  6\u20138 \n   Type 2  13  3\u20134 \nCloth     \n   Clean cloth  6  3 \n   White cloth  20  12 \n     \nSource: Self Employed Women\u2019s Association., available at http://www.wiego.org/reports/SEWA-\nreport-Waste-Recyclers.pdf \nBetween  2001  and  2007\u2014a  period  of  tremendous  economic  growth  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific\u2014average annual real wages in a sample of economies in the region grew at a rate of \n1.8%, far below the average annual growth in labor productivity over the same period (ILO \n2008a). Current evidence suggests that wages could remain stagnant or even fall during the \ncrisis  in  some  Asian  economies.  Relatively  weak  labor  market  governance  in  many \neconomies  in  the  region\u2014the  overwhelming  majority  of  which  have  rates  of  collective-\nbargaining coverage of less than 15%\u2014exacerbates the challenge of reaching negotiated \nsolutions to support wages during the crisis (ILO 2008a). However, maintaining wage so that \n10 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \npurchasing power and consumer demand do not deteriorate is essential for recovery (Wilson \n2009). \nThe situation in the labor market is compounded by relatively low public investment in social \nprotection in developing Asia. Social expenditure as a share of GDP is only 2.2% in Asia and \nthe Pacific, lagging behind other regions (Figure 4). As discussed in the next section, the \nshift to informal and vulnerable employment and the rise in working poverty are likely to be \nlong  lasting.  Further,  during  times  of  economic  crisis,  poor  households  often  cut  back \nspending on health and pull children from school as education becomes less affordable. \nChildren may be sent to work to supplement household income (Mosel and Sarkar 2009). \nWhile income alone is not the sole determinant of the decision to send a child to school or \nwork, its influence is real. During the Asian financial crisis, the Philippines saw a drop in \nenrolment rates and a rise in child labor among 10\u201314 year olds (Lim 2000). More recently, \nrapid inflation and macroeconomic instability in Pakistan brought a rise in child labor as \nfamilies have found few alternative coping mechanisms (IRIN News 2008).  \nFigure 4: Social expenditure as a percentage of GDP, most recent year available \nAdvanced economies 14.2\nCentral & Eastern Europe and\n11.5\nFormer Soviet Republics\nNorthern Africa 6.4\nLatin America & the\n4.5\nCaribbean\nAfrica 2.8\nMiddle East 2.2\nAsia & the Pacific 2.2\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: ILO 2009e.: The Financial and Economic Crisis: A Decent Work Response (Geneva, 2009), Figure 4 \nreferencing IMF: Government Financial Statistics (2007). \nImportantly, studies have shown that, when poor families have to choose between sending a \nboy or a girl to school, even under pre-crisis conditions, parents often choose to invest in \neducating their sons and retain their daughters\u2019 important household contributions. Further, \nfrom a medium- and long-term perspective, providing both girls and boys access to basic \neducation is an absolute necessity to ensure that the future labor force has the foundation \nneeded  to  engage  in  productive  employment  and  help  drive  national  growth  and \ndevelopment. \nThe  crisis  and  the  treatment  of  workers,  including  migrants,  have  revealed  many \nshortcomings  in  employment  regulations,  labor-relations  regimes,  and  social-protection \nsystems that deserve more attention in some economies. For these workers vulnerable to \nthe  crisis,  the  main  concern  must  be  upholding  their  rights  at  work  and  ensuring  fair \ntreatment and access to social protection. \n11 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \n3.4  Delayed Adjustment in the Labor Market \nHaving examined the labor market and social impacts to date, it is important to bear in mind \nthat the full impacts may yet to be realized and that the consequences for Asia\u2019s workers \nmay be deep and protracted. In past economic and financial crises, various indicators in the \nlabor market returned to pre-crisis levels on average only 4\u20135 years after output recovery \n(ILO 2009d). This section reviews this delayed recovery in the labor market by looking back \nat the Asian financial crisis. \nThe Asian financial crisis delivered a tremendous shock to numerous economies in the \nregion.

By 1999, the crisis-affected economies began to stabilize and \nrecovery was underway, thanks in part to an upturn in exports. Growth in the Korea reached \n9.5%, while Malaysia\u2019s economy expanded by 6.1%. By 2000, GDP in the Philippines grew \nat 6.0%, faster than the rate of growth in the several years prior to the crisis, while Indonesia \nachieved 5.4% GDP growth and Thailand 4.8%.  \nDespite the relatively rapid economic upturn, recovery in the labor markets of crisis-affected \neconomies was not as swift. Figure 5 illustrates the unemployment trend that took place \nbefore, during, and after the crisis. In Korea, the unemployment rate remained below 3.0% \nfrom 1993 to 1997 and skyrocketed to 7.0% at the peak of the crisis in 1998. It did not drop \nto pre-crisis levels until 2002, or 3 years after the quick and remarkable economic recovery \nin 1999. Similarly, the unemployment rate in Thailand averaged 1.2% from 1993 to 1997 but \nnearly  tripled  to  3.4%  in  1998  and  fell  below  2.0%  only  in  2002.  In  the  Philippines, \nunemployment reached a 10-year low of 7.4% in 1996 but rapidly increased to 9.8% in 1998 \nand, by 2004, had yet to fall back to pre-crisis levels. In the case of the Philippines, the \nunemployment trend was also shaped by rapid labor force growth of 15.8% from 1998 to \n2004 (ILO 2009a), which exerted tremendous pressure on new employment creation after \nthe crisis. \n12 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nFigure 5: Unemployment in Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Thailand, 1993\u20132004 \n(% of labor force) \n12\n10\nPhilippines\n8\n6\n4\nKorea, Rep. of\n2 Thailand\n0\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\n \nSource: ILO 2008b,: Key Indicators of the Labour Market (KILM), 5th Edition; ILO: Laborsta, 2008. \n \nMoreover, the Asian financial crisis impacted labor markets in the region in terms of not only \nthe level of unemployment but also of a shift in the type of jobs held by employed workers. In \nIndonesia, unemployment increased from 4.7% in 1997 to 5.5% in 1998 (ILO 2008b). The \nlarger impact, however, was on the number of workers in vulnerable employment; in 1 year \nalone, from 1997 to 1998, formal wage employment shrank by 1.5 million (4.9%) while the \nnumber of workers categorized as own-account or contributing family workers increased by \n3.7 million (6.8%). In addition, despite the economic recovery that began in 1999, the share \nof  own-account  and  contributing  family  workers  continued  to  increase  (Figure  6).  The \neconomic  upturn  did  not  translate  into  an  equivalent  rise  in  the  share  of  formal  wage \nemployment, and the share of own-account or contributing family workers approached the \npre-crisis level only in 2006. \n \nFigure 6: Employment by Status in Indonesia, 1997\u20132007 (%) \n100% 1.7 1.7 2.9 2.3 3.1 3.0 2.9 3.2 3.0 3.0 2.9\n80%\n62.8 65.4 64.0 64.9 63.7 64.7 66.1 64.9 63.4 63.1 63.1\n60%\n40%\n20%\n35.5 32.9 33.1 32.8 33.3 32.3 31.0 31.9 33.6 33.9 34.0\n0%\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nWage employment (%) Own-account and contributing family workers (%) Employers (%)\n \n13 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nSources: ILO 2008b.: Key Indicators of the Labour Market (KILM), 5th Edition; ILO: Laborsta, 2008. \nAfter the crisis, labor productivity in Indonesia dropped by 15.4% and returned to pre-crisis \nlevels only in 2003 (Figure 7).

In January \n2009, the ILO projected that total unemployment in Asia and the Pacific could increase by \nbetween 8.7 million and 28.3 million from 2007 to 2009. On the basis of updated economic \ngrowth projections and newly available labor  market data, this range has been slightly \nnarrowed to between 9.1 million (scenario 1) and 26.3 million (scenario 3), with a central \nscenario 2 of 13.8 million. The ILO\u2019s current projection for unemployment in 2009 in Asia and \nthe Pacific is between scenarios 2 and 3. Significant volatility and uncertainty in economic \ngrowth forecasts and insufficient data for many economies in the region make more precise \nprojections of the increase in unemployment impossible at this time.  \n                                                \n11 See: ILO: Global Employment Trends Update, (Geneva, May 2009).

At the \nsame time, large fiscal policy stimuli and other responses taken by many governments in the \nregion reduce the likelihood of unemployment increasing towards the upper range given by \nscenario 3.  \nIn terms of subregional projections, the unemployment rate in the developed economies in \nAsia is projected to rise to 4.9%\u20135.7% in 2009, up from 3.9% in 2007 and 4.0% in 2008. \nEast  Asia\u2019s  unemployment  rate  may  increase  to  4.6%\u20135.8%,  up  from  3.9%  in  2007. \nUnemployment rates are not currently expected to rise by as much in Southeast Asia and \nthe Pacific or South Asia as in other parts of Asia. In Southeast Asia and the Pacific, the \ncurrent projection is for an unemployment rate of 5.4%\u20136.2%, compared with 5.4% in 2007 \nand 2008, and in South Asia the current projection is for an unemployment rate of 5.1%\u2013\n5.8%, versus 5.2% in 2008. \nAs noted above, young workers are being hit hard. In the region as a whole, the youth \nunemployment rate is projected to increase to 11.1%\u201313.1% in 2009, up from 10.3% in \n2007. Southeast Asia has the highest youth unemployment rate in the region, and this could \nrise to 15.7%\u201318.1% in 2009 from 14.8% in 2007. \nWith  women  often  making  up  a  disproportionate  share  of  jobs  in  export-oriented \nmanufacturing in Asia, they face a steeper rise in unemployment than do men as a result of \nthe crisis. The unemployment rate for women in the region is projected to rise from 4.4% in \n2007 to 4.9%\u20135.8%. For men, it is expected that the unemployment rate will rise from 4.7% \nin 2007 to 5.0%\u20135.9%. Across all three scenarios developed by the ILO to gauge the likely \nimpact of the crisis on unemployment, women are projected to account for an larger share of \nthe region\u2019s total unemployed in 2009 than in 2007. \nPrior to the onset of the crisis, more than 62% of workers in Asia and the Pacific were in \nvulnerable employment, with more than 76% of South Asia\u2019s workers in this group. In \nSoutheast  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  62%  of  workers  are  estimated  to  be  in  vulnerable \nemployment, while in East Asia the share of vulnerable workers is more than 55%. Because \nthe requisite data are not available for many countries in the region for 2008 and 2009, it is \nnot  possible  to  provide  precise  estimates  of  the  impact  of  the  crisis  on  vulnerable \nemployment. However, the three scenarios developed by the ILO indicate that the number of \nworkers in vulnerable employment in the region could range between 1.1 billion and 1.2 \nbillion in 2009, versus 1.1 billion in 2007. This would represent a vulnerable employment rate \nof between 59.6% and 63.5% for the region as a whole (Figure 8).12 \n                                                \n12 The lower bound estimate represents a decrease in the share of vulnerable employment. This estimate is \nbased on the historical relationship between economic growth and vulnerable employment.

Subregional figures put this massive challenge in perspective. In \nSouth Asia, the number of workers living on less than US$2 per day was 15 times greater \nthan the number of unemployed. In Southeast Asia and the Pacific, the ratio was more than \n9, while in East Asia it was above 8.  \nThe precise impact of the economic crisis on the level and degree of working poverty in the \nregion is difficult to pin down because of the absence of reliable and timely poverty estimates \nand  labor  market  information.  The  ILO  produced  three  scenarios  for  working  poverty. \nScenario 1 was generated by taking the average relationship between poverty and per-\ncapita GDP over the 1980\u20132006 period and projecting this forward on the basis of 2009 \nGDP  growth  projections.  Scenario  2  projected  working  poverty  on  the  assumption  that \nindividuals living on the fringe of poverty (5% above the poverty line in 2008 and 10% above \nthe poverty line in 2009) would fall into poverty. Scenario 3 projected working poverty on the \nassumption that individuals living 10% above the poverty line in 2008 and 20% above the \npoverty line in 2009 would fall into poverty. Notably, across all three scenarios, the number \nof workers living on less than US$2 was projected to rise in both South Asia and Southeast \nAsia and the Pacific. In South Asia, the three scenarios produced a range of 494 million to \n538 million in 2009, versus 480 million in 2007. In Southeast Asia and the Pacific, the \nscenarios produced a range of 146 million to 178 million in 2009, versus 144 million in 2007. \nIn the long run, progress towards reducing working poverty requires increases in labor \nproductivity, since the poor typically do not suffer from lack of work but rather from low \nproductivity and consequent low earnings. Across all three scenarios developed by the ILO \nfor 2009, labor productivity (measured as output per worker) was projected to decline in \nSoutheast Asia and the Pacific. In South Asia, the highest potential rate of productivity \ngrowth in 2009 is 2.8%, versus average annual growth in productivity of 5% in 2000\u20132007. \nEast Asia is expected to see a substantial slowdown in productivity growth this year.

NATIONAL POLICY RESPONSES TO THE CRISIS \n4.1  Fiscal Policy: Size  \nIn the second half of 2008, the rapid spread of the financial crisis through global credit \nmarkets  prompted  unprecedented  initiatives  (capital  injections,  liquidity  measures,  and \ndeposit guarantees) aimed at restoring confidence in the financial system, especially in \nthose economies in Asia and the Pacific that were closely integrated into global financial \nmarkets. Many central banks in the region began lowering interest rates, and rates have \ncontinued  a  downward  march,  though  inflation  concerns  and  currency  weakness  have \nprevented some central banks from more aggressive easing rates. In November 2008, \nhowever, evaporating orders for exports, decelerating output growth, and the grim outlook \nfor 2009 shifted the policy focus to fiscal measures to increase aggregate demand.  \nSeveral countries in the region that had entered the crisis on a fairly solid footing\u2014with large \nreserves and relatively little foreign or domestic debt\u2014announced fiscal stimulus packages. \nBy December, the PRC, India, Korea, Malaysia, and Philippines had already rolled out bold \npolicies to increase aggregate demand. Within less than a month, India announced a second \npackage. Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore also unveiled fiscal stimulus programs, and \nMalaysia announced its second package in March 2009.  \nThe size of fiscal stimulus packages varies greatly, ranging from US$586 billion in the PRC \nto Viet Nam\u2019s US$1 billion. The PRC measure accounts for 12% of the economy\u2019s GDP \n(Figure 9). Singapore and Malaysia each plan to spend 8%\u201310% of their GDP to increase \ndemand. At the other end of the spectrum, India\u2019s two fiscal packages together equal less \nthan 1% of the GDP.  \nEstimates of size must be viewed with some caution, however. First, it is not always clear \nhow much of a package is new spending versus previously planned spending. Second, \npackages in some countries, notably the PRC and the Philippines, are financed not only \nfrom public resources but also from nongovernment investment that may or may not become \navailable  in  a  timely  manner.  Third,  the  timeframe  in  which  stimulus  packages  will  be \nimplemented varies. For most economies, the timeframe is 1 year. But for some, like the \nPRC, the time frame is 2 years, and for Singapore and Korea it is even longer. Fourth, some \npackages include measures such as loan guarantees that are primarily the task of monetary \npolicy not fiscal policy, making it difficult to disentangle fiscal measures from financial efforts. \nFifth, some governments had already put in place policies and programs that are now \nmitigating the crisis but are not considered part of the fiscal response. \n17 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nFigure 9: Fiscal Stimulus Packages as a Share of 2009 GDP (%) \nChina 12.0\nKorea, Rep. of 10.2\nMalaysia 9.9\nSingapore 8.0\nPhilippines 1.8\nIndonesia 1.3\nThailand 1.1\nViet Nam 1.0\nIndia 0.7\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nNotes: For India, Malaysia, and Republic of Korea, combined percentage of two stimulus packages. \nSources: World Bank 2009; authors\u2019 estimates.: East Asia and Pacific Update: Battling the Forces of Global \nRecession (April 2009). \n4.2  Fiscal Policy: Composition \nAs does the size of the fiscal packages, their composition varies greatly across developing \nAsia.  Most  stimulus  packages  emphasize  public  spending,  especially  investment  in \ninfrastructure and maintenance. Public spending accounts for over 90% of the stimulus \npackage in the PRC, over 65% in Thailand and Viet Nam, and 40%\u201350% in Korea, Malaysia, \nand Singapore (World Bank 2009).  \nThe emphasis on public spending on infrastructure reflects the widely shared assessment \nthat such measures tend to have a significant direct and indirect multiplier effects in the short \nrun on both output and employment.13 The direct employment effect is evidenced as new \njobs are created by a particular spending measure. The indirect effect arises partly from \nincreased  consumption  on  the  part  of  newly  recruited  workers,  which  stimulates  other \nindustries,  and  from  spillover  of  increased  public  spending  into  other  sectors  through \nintermediate inputs. Infrastructure investments provide additional benefits, as they contribute \nto eliminating growth bottlenecks and reducing rural\u2013urban development gaps and thereby \nboost domestic consumption. \nPublic spending to support the poor and vulnerable has expanded in many countries, but \nthese measures constitute on average a small share of additional public spending. Measures \ninclude unconditional and conditional cash transfers to poor and low-income families (PRC, \nIndonesia,  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Singapore),  various  schemes  supporting  child \neducation and health (Indonesia and Philippines), subsidized utilities (Thailand), as well as \nsupport for housing in many economies. The PRC has also begun to tackle longer-term \nchallenges, including closing the rural\u2013urban divide by extending medical coverage to 200 \nmillion uninsured people through an additional package for health-care reform (Hornby and \n                                                \n13 A review of members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggests that, \nunder normal circumstances, fiscal multipliers are around 1 for public spending and half that for tax measures, \nwith lower multipliers in more open economies (OECD 2009). See: OECD: OECD Economic Outlook (Paris, \nOECD, 2009).  \n18 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nChiang  2009).  Even  countries  with  limited  or  no  fiscal  space  have  taken  measures  to \nincrease the budget allocations for social-transfer programs.14 \nTax  reductions  and  income  transfers,  on  the  other  hand,  rarely  have  direct  output  or \nemployment effects. Their indirect impact depends on how firms and households react to \nincreased income. In the current environment, firms face not only a sharp fall in demand but \nalso unprecedented uncertainty regarding the future. In such a situation, they often take a \nwait-and-see attitude with respect to investment, and households are likely to exhibit similar \nbehavior in consumption (Spilimbergo et al. 2008). Therefore, across-the-board incentives \naimed at businesses or households, such as subsidies to firms and reductions in corporate \nand income taxes, are likely to have only a moderate, short-term effect on growth and jobs. \nMoreover, in developing Asian countries with a large informal economy, tax and income \npolicy tools have limited reach to businesses and workers operating in the informal economy \nor impact on them. Despite the weak multiplier effect of tax measures, cuts in corporate, \nsales,  and  income  taxes  have  been  the  second-largest  component  of  the  stimulus \nmeasures.  \nIf fiscal measures target credit-constrained businesses (including small firms) and liquidity-\nconstrained consumers who are likely to spend more (notably the poor, the unemployed, and \nlow-income households), then the short-term multiplier effect of the stimulus is likely to be \nhigher. Measures along these lines include loans for credit-constrained small firms in India, \nKorea, Thailand, and Viet Nam; increased budget allocation for microfinance in Indonesia; \nand various schemes to assist specific industries in several economies.  \nIn undertaking fiscal stimulus policy measures, it is also critical to take into account both the \nshort-term  impact  on  aggregate demand  and measures  to  enhance economies\u2019 growth \npotential in the medium and long term, so that the increase in fiscal spending today is \ncovered by higher fiscal revenues without requiring prohibitively high taxes in the future. In \nthis  respect,  a  focus  on  maintaining  productive  employment,  income,  and  household \npurchasing  power,  combined  with  supply-side  measures  including  education  and  skills \ntraining and other active labor market policies, could provide for more comprehensive crisis \nresponse and recovery measures. \n4.3  Fiscal Stimulus and Productive Jobs \nSome governments have announced explicit measures to assist workers and employers as \npart  of their fiscal  package.  Examples  include subsidized  employment  inKorea, training \nprograms in Singapore, and reduction in unemployment insurance contributions and other \npayroll taxes to minimize job losses in Indonesia; temporary job-loss subsidies to assist laid-\noff workers in Viet Nam; skills training for retrenched workers in Malaysia and Thailand; job-\nsearch assistance and financial support to laid-off migrant workers to relocate to rural areas \nin the PRC; and direct public sector job creation for unemployed and graduates in many \neconomies. \nThese measures are often relatively small components of stimulus packages, however, and \nlonger-term  measures  to  enhance  productivity  such  as  skills  training  are  often  lacking. \nFurther,  few  fiscal  packages  have  explicit  targets  for  job  creation.  The  exceptions  are \nIndonesia (2.6 million jobs), Korea (creating green jobs under the Green New Deal initiative), \nand Singapore, where a key objective of the stimulus is helping Singaporeans keep their \njobs and support their families.  \nBox: Pressures on Domestic Demand \n                                                \n14 Pakistan plans to increase spending on social protection from 0.3% of GDP in 2008 to 0.9% of GDP in 2009 \nand is expected to expand the coverage of electricity subsidies for the poor and other poverty-alleviation \nmeasures through the Benazir Income Support Programme (IMF Survey Online 2008).

The current crisis is \nalready reducing government revenues and weakening fiscal positions. There is, therefore, a \nneed for transparency and impact evaluation. The results of such an assessment could \nboost public confidence that the fiscal stimulus measures will deliver sufficient employment \nand support for the poor and vulnerable. It would also help policy makers to refine the \nstimulus packages to maximize their economic, employment, and welfare impact. \n                                                \n15 Examples include multi-stakeholder meetings in the Philippines, sector-specific tripartite discussions in India, \nand a tripartite agreement through the National Wages Council in Singapore. \n20 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \n5.  POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n5.1  Job-Rich Public Spending Programs   \nA recent assessment of the estimated employment effects of fiscal measures has revealed \nthat \u201cthe greater the employment orientation of the measure, the stronger the stimulus for the \nreal economy\u201d (ILO 2009e). In particular, public spending on employment-intensive areas \ntends to have a high multiplier. Public investment in infrastructure is a major opportunity to \nboth generate employment and address some development challenges.  \nIn those economies where the fiscal stimulus focuses on investment in infrastructure and \nmaintenance,  a  significant  share  of  the  new  jobs  will  be  in  construction.  Employment \ncreation in construction is a positive outcome, as the economic crisis has hit the construction \nsector hard in many economies. Further positive employment effects can be generated if \nresources are allocated to rural areas. Decent job opportunities in the countryside were \nscarce prior to the crisis, and they are likely to become even scarcer as urban workers leave \nfactories and cities and return to their home villages. Therefore, infrastructure investment \ndirected  to  rural  areas  has  great  potential  for  poverty  alleviation  as  this  will  generate \nemployment. To effectively improve employment and productivity, however, infrastructure \nprojects  need  to  focus  on  critical  development  bottlenecks  and  use  existing  domestic \nsupplies and skills.  \nMost new employment opportunities in construction are likely to be taken up by unskilled and \nsemi-skilled workers. Infrastructure works may have a gendered effect on job creation, as \nthey traditionally attract mainly male workers, while most of the retrenched workers in export-\noriented industries like electronics, textiles, and garments are young women. Therefore, \npolicy  makers  need  to  pay  attention  not  only  to  the  employment  intensity  of  stimulus \nmeasures, but also to the composition of the jobs they are likely to create, if they want to \nsucceed  in  spreading  employment  creation  as  widely  as  possible  across  categories  of \nworkers. \nSpreading public spending and job creation broadly can contribute to rebalancing some \neconomies, shifting away from a heavy reliance on export-oriented growth to development \nbased on both export growth and domestic demand. In this respect, investments in free \neducation, affordable health care, and pension systems are essential, as they provide basic \neconomic and social security to citizens, encouraging them to consume more and thereby \nboosting  demand  in  the  domestic  economy.  This  will  not  only  support  the  recovery  of \nnational economies but also help millions to overcome poverty.16 Beyond infrastructure, \nincreased investment is equally critical in other labor-intensive social services like child care \nand, in ageing societies such as the PRC, Singapore, and Thailand, support for the elderly.  \n5.2  Speed of Implementation \nPackages must be implemented quickly because the need for action is urgent. This calls for \nactions that  can  be  rolled  out rapidly  and  have  significant  employment  impacts  almost \nimmediately.  Front-loading  packages  with  public  spending  on  projects  that  are  already \napproved\u2014especially in infrastructure, housing, maintenance, health, and education\u2014tends \nto have immediate and strong multiplier effects. Scaling up existing social transfers to protect \nthe  poor  and  most  vulnerable,  and  increasing  other  welfare  payments  to  low-income \nfamilies, can all be implemented quickly. Government purchases of goods and services can \nbe introduced rapidly, but there may be delays before the impact of increased spending \nbenefits labor. \n                                                \n16 This stance was supported by global trade unions (ITUC, TUAC, and Global Unions 2008). See: ITUC, TUAC \nand Global Unions: Trade Union Statement to the \u2018G20 Crisis Summit\u2019: The Global Unions \u2018Washington \nDeclaration\u2019 (November 2008). \n21 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \n5.3  Coordinated Approach to Crisis Response \nFiscal stimulus packages aimed at promoting aggregate demand in individual economies \ncan have regional and international spillover effects through trade and investment. This is \nparticularly the case for the more open Asian economies with high propensities to import. \nSuch spillovers suggest the importance of coordinated global and regional approaches to \nfiscal stimulus packages to address individual country concerns on import leakage and to \nfoster  greater  cost  effectiveness  in  measures.  In  addition,  trade  and  investment  have \nsignificant influence on employment in individual economies, suggesting the need for greater \nglobal and regional policy coordination on employment and social protection policies in \naddition to fiscal policies. With regard to regional approaches, Asia and the Pacific has a \nrange of regional collaboration approaches, including the Chiang Mai Initiative, upon which \nthe region can draw. \n5.4  Efficiency and Coverage of Social Protection: a Social Floor  \nAs the crisis unfolds, the risks that people face are exacerbated by limited social protection. \nSupporting workers and their families through well-designed social policies should be a key \ncomponent of stimulating the economy and averting a social crisis. Many governments \nrecognize the importance of social protection and have stepped up their efforts in their \noverall policy response. However, measures have often failed to reach the groups worst \naffected by the present crisis: the nearly poor who recently escaped poverty and who now \nface the prospect of slipping below the poverty line as they lose their jobs in export-oriented \nindustries.  \nTo help them, unemployment insurance is an automatic stabilizer that can cushion the \nimpact  of  the  economic  shock  on  workers  in  the  formal  economy  and  help  maintain \naggregate demand. Evidence suggests that automatic stabilizers have a more prompt and \nconsistent countercyclical effect than do discretionary policies (IMF 2008), and that their \nfiscal  cost  automatically  declines  when  the  number  of  beneficiaries  falls  back. \nUnemployment insurance can slow the transmission of the crisis from urban to rural areas, \nespecially where large numbers of rural migrants have lost jobs in export-oriented industries. \nHowever, very few countries in the region have a proper unemployment insurance system, \nand even higher-income economies such as Malaysia and Singapore are not exceptions \n(Source: Authors. \nTable A.2.2). Another reason for the limited role of unemployment insurance in developing \nAsia is that wage employees in the formal economy are a relatively small segment of \nworkers. In Viet Nam, where unemployment benefits were recently introduced, wage-earning \nworkers account for less than 22% of total employment (Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and \nSocial Affairs 2007).  \nIntroducing unemployment insurance schemes is, despite their initially limited reach, an \nimportant step toward both protecting workers and supporting domestic demand during the \ncrisis. Moreover, improving the responsiveness of existing unemployment benefit systems \ncan improve the effectiveness of policy response to the downturn. This can be done, for \nexample,  by  extending  the  length  of,  or  relaxing  the  qualifying  requirements  for, \nunemployment  insurance  benefits,  as  was  recently  seen  in  Japan  and  a  few  other \neconomies. Another example is the use of unemployment insurance to subsidize retraining \nprograms in companies in Hubei Province of the PRC, as an alternative to retrenchment, \nand to reward enterprises that have paid insurance premiums for more than 2 consecutive \nyears without layoffs (Lee 2009). \nTraditional social transfer programs targeting the poor and vulnerable vary in their design, \nranging from food provision to subsidized utilities and cash transfers. The effectiveness of \nthese measures depends on how well they target needy households and on their capability \n22 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nto  minimize  administration  costs  and  leakage  to  the  non-poor.  Experience  shows  that \nacross-the-board food and utility subsidies often come at a significant fiscal and economic \ncost. They are not easily reversed and have often have only a modest impact on poverty \n(World Bank Development Research Group 2008). Further, many schemes are unresponsive \nto changes in the beneficiaries\u2019 need for assistance (Ravallion 2008). A promising approach \nto  address  these  deficiencies  is  to  strengthen  the  self-targeting  component  of  existing \nprograms, a move that encourage beneficiaries to enroll when in need and drop out when \nbetter  opportunities  arise.17 One  such  example  is  India\u2019s  National  Rural  Employment \nGuarantee Scheme, which offers 100 days of work per family in rural areas at the minimum \nwage for agriculture and is complemented by a social security scheme in the informal \neconomy and a national health insurance scheme for unorganized workers. Introducing \nemployment-guarantee programs in urban areas can provide safety for urban informal sector \nworkers affected by the crisis.  \nSupporting poor households to keep their children in school must be part of the policy \nresponse in low-income economies. Lower school fees can keep children in school, while \nsupport to family health can further mitigate the potentially long-term impact of the crisis. \nAlso important are extending school meal programs (food for education) and reducing such \nindirect costs of education as transportation, textbooks, and uniforms (ILO-IPEC 2008). \nScholarships  targeting  poor  families  can  also  be  effective.  Thailand  pursues  a  more \nambitious strategy by allocating a significant share of its stimulus package to providing free \neducation to children up to the age of 15, plus health care in rural areas. Public\u2013private \npartnerships that support the education of children in poor households have a role to play.18 \nThe most effective programs are those that combine measures to lower educational costs \nwith incentives for parents to keep children in school and undertake regular medical checks. \nIndonesia  has  implemented  this  kind  of  conditional  cash  transfer  since  2007  and  will \nstrengthen the program as part of its crisis policy response. There is evidence from impact \nevaluations that conditional cost transfers bring real benefits to poor households in terms of \nboth current and future income through increased investment in child schooling and health \ncare (Ravallion 2008; Das, Do, and Ozler 2004). \nThe crisis provides opportunities in health-care reforms. The PRC recently introduced a 3 \nyear,  US$125  billion  plan  to  reform  its  health-care  system.  The  plan  aims  to  provide \nuniversal basic health care and extend coverage to the uninsured. It will boost investment in \nhealth infrastructure and enhance the monitoring of water and food safety and workplace \nsafety. If well implemented, these measures will have a number of positive impacts beyond \nthe health-care system. Public investment should spur growth and create jobs that can \nhasten crisis recovery. In the medium and long term, it will also help to reduce the need for \nhigh  household  savings  and  boost  domestic  consumption.  Altogether,  this  will  help  to \nrebalance PRC economic growth toward domestic markets. \nThe current crisis presents an opportunity for some developing countries in the region to \nimprove their poverty-reduction programs with the aim of gradually developing an effective \nsocial floor. Such a social floor could include improved access to jobs; basic health care; \nprotection  and  education  for  children,  the  elderly,  and  people  with  disabilities;  social \nassistance for the poor or unemployed; and other features that vary according need and \nstage of development.  \n                                                \n17 A self-targeting scheme introduced under the Thai fiscal package uses subsidies for low-quality public transport, for which demand falls as \nincome increases. \n18 At the end of 2008, the government of the Philippines introduced the youth education\u2013youth employability (YE-YE) project in partnership with the Jollibee fast food \nchain. The objective of the partnership is to provide opportunities for the children of informal sector workers and child laborers to pursue a post-secondary course through \ntuition fee advances while obtaining practical training in the workplace. The YE-YE project targets helping 100,000 children in 2 years (Department of Labor and \nEmployment  2008).  See:  Department  of  Labour  and  Employment  web  site,  Weathering  the  Crisis  through  Well-placed  Programs,  24  December  2008, \nwww.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000002269. \n23 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \n5.5  Credit-constrained Businesses and Industrial Adjustment \nThe employment effect of fiscal stimulus measures aimed at enterprises depends on the \npolicy tools used and the characteristics of the targeted sectors. Japan and Korea have \nintroduced wage-subsidy schemes for particular groups and sectors, while Singapore has \nestablished across-the-board subsidized employment to encourage businesses to preserve \nworkplaces  in  the  downturn. 19  Other  governments  reduced  unemployment  insurance \ncontributions  and  other  payroll  taxes. 20 All  these  measures  can  reduce  the  costs  of \nemployment for firms without reducing employment or workers\u2019 take-home pay, thereby \nproviding incentives for work and maintaining consumption. They may be appropriate when \nthe crisis is short lived or a particular industry and enterprises is able to recover quickly. But, \nin the longer run, they may not be fiscally sustainable, and their role in developing Asia is \nlimited by the relatively small formal economy.  \nWhen considering support to specific industries, a critical aspect of the policy choice should \nbe  the  employment  intensity  of  a  sector,  as  fiscal  stimulus  measures  aimed  at  labor-\nintensive  industries  have  larger  employment  effects.  In  addition,  incentives  that  target \nsectors that are less import intensive are likely to lead to a larger relative increase in \ndomestic demand and employment than similar incentives provided to more import-intensive \nsectors.  \nSupport for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) needs to be a key component of \nmost  stimulus  packages  in  the  region,  partly  because  the  crisis  has  hit  SMEs \ndisproportionately relative to larger companies and because small firms account for a large \nshare of total employment in most economies. Access to credit is particularly critical for \nviable small firms. The main reason for government-backed credit guarantees is that, while \ncash injections to banks may help alleviate the overall credit crunch, lending to SMEs may \nnot improve unless policies are directed specifically toward their needs. This has affected \nthose small firms that primarily rely on bank credit to meet their operating costs, including \nnumerous SMEs that work for supply chains and global production networks.  \nGovernment assistance to enterprises that face particularly difficult problems that could lead \nto closure or large employment reductions should also be considered. However, public \nsubsidies to enterprises should be linked to restructuring plans that preserve employment \nand result from social dialogue between management and trade unions (ILO 2008e). \n5.6  Short-Term Challenges and Long-Term Priorities \nDeveloping countries that are able to tackle short-term challenges while remaining focused \non  long-term  priorities  will  likely  emerge  stronger  and  take  greater  advantage  of  the \nrecovery. Some of the measures that would help in both the short and long term include \nstructural reforms to enhance productivity and labor quality and investment in green growth \nand green jobs.  \nSpending on research and development and investing in people can boost the longer-term \nproductivity of the economy. With this aim, Malaysia and Thailand have allocated part of \n                                                \n19\n The Singaporean government has allocated US$3 billion to the Jobs Credit Scheme, under which employers \nwill receive wage support for each employee on the enterprise\u2019s payroll. The subsidy covers 12% of the first \nUS$2,500 in wages. It will be given in four quarterly payments, with each payment based on the workers who \nare with the employer at the time. It is important to note that the scheme will help all companies, including \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises and companies that pay much lower income tax under the Singaporean \ntax schedule (Singapore government 2009). See: Singapore Government: Budget Speech 2009: Keeping \nJobs, Building for the Future (January 2009). \n20 \nIn Indonesia, the stimulus package includes a measure to compensate for employees\u2019 income taxes usually \npaid by businesses. Unlike in many other economies, most companies in Indonesia subsidize the income tax \nliabilities of their workers, thus taking on more tax burden (Suharmonko 2009). See: Aditya Suharmoko: \n\u201cGovernment unveils final stimulus plan to boost economy\u201d, Jakarta Post, 28 January 2009. \n24 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \ntheir stimulus spending to training and education. As training costs less during an economic \ndownturn, Singapore looks at the recession as a good opportunity to retrain workers. The \nSkills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience, a new tripartite umbrella program supported \nby the fiscal package, helps employers to retrain and develop their workforce rather than \nsimply cut jobs and will boost national productivity and competitiveness over the medium \nand long term (Singapore Department of Statistics 2009). \nResponse measures to the current crisis can be opportunities for addressing economic and \nenvironmental priorities at the same time.21 This can be done by giving national economies \nthe necessary stimulus against global shocks while prompting a transition toward more \nsustainable  development.  Measures  to  increase  demand  and  restore  growth  should \ntherefore  take  into  consideration  environmental  concerns  and  the  high  potential  for \ninvestments  in  environmentally  friendly  areas  to  generate  future  employment  and \nsustainable growth. This is particularly true for developing economies, which can benefit \nfrom double dividends by promoting green growth and green jobs while targeting poverty \nreduction. The scope and potential for green jobs are vast (UNEP 2008).  \nSome governments are already taking steps toward a green recovery strategy.  Korea\u2019s \nGreen New Deal aims to improve the use of the nation\u2019s four major rivers, construct dams \nand other water-management facilities, develop green transportation networks and clean \nenergy technologies, build 2 million green homes, and create more than a million green jobs. \nMalaysia has introduced a training program to prepare unemployed graduates for green jobs \nunder the Sarawak Corridor for Renewable Energy, a major project that is expected to \ngenerate 1.6 million jobs by 2030 (Prime Minister\u2019s Office of Malaysia 2009). \nCrisis recovery, however, also entails large environmental challenges. Large infrastructure \nprojects for railroads, highways, and housing feature prominently in many fiscal packages. If \nnot designed to be environmentally friendly, they can generate widespread environmental \ndamage. It is critical to carry out rapid environmental impact assessments before the work \nbegins. The PRC\u2019s package, for example, allocates RMB350 billion (or 9% of all stimulus \nresources) to environmental protection and preliminary environmental assessments.  \nWhile the potential economic and environmental benefits of these types of investments are \ngreat, substantial upfront expenditures and political will are required. Governments in the \nregion must look to the long term if they want to turn the global economic challenge into an \nopportunity for sustainable growth and development. \n5.7  Enabling a Sound Policy Environment \nMeasures are best implemented through social dialogue, which can help improve the design \nof the crisis response measures at the enterprise, industry, and national level, as well as \nprovide political support for the fiscal packages and other government policies. However, \nmuch depends on national circumstances and the quality of industrial relations. In some \neconomies, the global crisis has intensified existing tensions in labor\u2013management relations, \nleading to strikes and disrupted production. On the other hand, in economies with more \ndeveloped  and  coordinated  industrial  relations  that  feature  broad-based  representation, \nstrong  labor  institutions,  and  long-term  trust  between  partners,  social  dialogue  has \nnegotiated  solutions  that  in  some  instances  have  become  components  of  the  broader \nnational policy response to the crisis. Sharing experiences and building the capacity of social \npartners to engage in constructive dialogue to address the crisis must be a priority.  \nAs the deep recession could add to pressures undermining workers\u2019 rights, it is essential to \nensure that social progress is not reversed. Above all, the crisis should not be taken as an \n                                                \n21 This is aptly expressed by the Trade Unions\u2019 Washington Declaration, stating that \u201cthis is the time to aid \neconomic recovery through environmentally responsible investment designed to create jobs\u201d (ITUC, TUAC, \nand Global Unions 2008). See, ITUC, TUAC and Global Unions: Trade Union Statement to the \u2018G20 Crisis \nSummit\u2019: The Global Unions \u2018Washington Declaration\u2019 (November 2008). \n25 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nexcuse  to  erode  such  fundamental  labor  rights  as  freedom  of  association,  collective \nbargaining, and freedom from all forms of forced and compulsory labor, as well as the \nabolition of child labor and discrimination in employment. Careful monitoring of the impacts \nof  the  crisis  on  labor  standards  will  be  essential  to  preserving  social  progress  and \nmaintaining social stability.  \nThe employment impact of any stimulus package will depend significantly on how rapidly the \nlocal economy can respond to any increase in domestic demand. In this regard, policy \ncoherence is essential. The impact of major public investment in infrastructure will depend \non  whether  local  construction  materials  are  available  and  whether  local  suppliers  and \ncontractors, many of them small firms, have the resources and incentives necessary to \nparticipate.  Similarly,  social  transfers  to  poor  and  low-income  households  will  generate \ndemand for food  and  other  basic consumable goods, many  of  which are  produced  by \nfarmers and local SMEs. By helping to ensure that SMEs can sustain their operations now \nand thereby benefit from the subsequent increase in consumer demand, policies should \nfacilitate  a  rise  in  household  incomes  coordinated  with  supporting  local  economic \ndevelopment. Targeting small firm clusters can have particularly beneficial multiplier effects. \nIt is crucial to strengthen administrative and institutional capacity as well as coordination \namong various agencies to ensure these programs are effective.  \nDespite wide-ranging policy actions by central banks and policy makers in Asia and around \nthe world, fiscal strains are acute and confidence remains low, dragging down the real \neconomy (IMF 2009). Their integration into the global economy means Asian economies are \nunlikely to recover fully without a broader recovery in the rest of the world. Further, while \neconomies may bounce back quickly on the strength of their policies and solid underlying \nfundamentals,  recovery  in  labor  markets  is  likely  to  lag  because  of  relatively  weaker \nemployment and social protection policies. Strong cooperation on economic, labor, and \nemployment policies among Asian economies could help mitigate the impacts of the crisis \nand promote recovery. Solidarity is critical, as not every economy in the region or globally \nhas the fiscal resources to implement bold measures to counteract the crisis. This is the time \nfor strong and coordinated international policy actions to support recovery and to improve \nthe prospects for decent work for all (ILO 2008c). \n \n \n \n26 ", "ADBI Working Paper 243    Huynh, Kapsos, Kim, and Sziraczki \n \nREFERENCES \nAbella, M. and G.

Unemployment Scenarios \nScenario 1 projected unemployment using an econometric model based on the historical \nrelationship between gross domestic product (GDP) growth and unemployment rates in \nindividual economies between 1991 and 2008, together with the April 2009 International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) GDP growth projections. \nScenario 2 projected unemployment based on the historical relationship between economic \ngrowth and unemployment during the worst observed economic downturn in each economy \nby applying this relationship to the April 2009 IMF GDP growth projections. \nScenario 3 projected unemployment by taking the worst observed year-on-year increase in \neach country\u2019s unemployment rate and assumed that this same increase would happen \nsimultaneously in all developed economies in 2009. Given the lagged impact of the crisis in \ndeveloping  economies,  for  these  economies  half  of  the  largest  observed  increase  was \nassumed to occur in 2009. \n2. Vulnerable Employment Scenarios \nScenario 1 projected vulnerable employment by using the historical relationship between \neconomic growth and vulnerable employment at the national level between 1991 and 2008, \ntogether with the April 2009 IMF GDP growth projections. \nScenario 2 projected vulnerable employment based on the historical relationship between \neconomic growth and vulnerable employment during the worst observed economic downturn \nin each economy by applying this relationship to the April 2009 IMF GDP growth projections. \nScenario 3 projected vulnerable employment by taking the worst observed year-on-year \nincrease  in  each  economy\u2019s  vulnerable  employment  rate  and  assumed  that  this  same \nincrease would happen simultaneously in all economies in 2009. \n3. Working Poverty Scenarios \nScenario 1 projected working poverty by using the historical relationship between poverty \nrates and per-capita GDP figures (using regression analysis at the regional level to identify \nthe  average  relationship  between  these  variables  over  1980\u20132006)  and  projected  this \nforward on the basis of the April 2009 IMF GDP growth projections. \nScenario 2 projected working poverty based on the assumption that individuals living on the \nfringe of poverty (5% above the poverty line for 2008 and 10% above the poverty line for \n2009) would fall into poverty. \nScenario 3 projected working poverty on the assumption that individuals living 10% above \nthe poverty line for 2008 and 20% above the poverty line for 2009 would fall into poverty. \n4.
