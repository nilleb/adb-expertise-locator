Introduction\nPolicy makers in Asia have remained reluctant to completely do away with capital controls \ndespite pursuing an overall strategy of economic liberalization since the early 1990s. \nUnabated and large capital inflows tend to create asset bubbles in the nontradeables \nsector, to suddenly stop or reverse, and to cause financial turmoil given shallow and \nunderdeveloped domestic capital markets in emerging countries. Many concerns relate \nto large capital inflows causing real domestic currency appreciation, rendering exports \nuncompetitive. \nBeginning 2002, some countries in Asia had begun to re-employ capital control \nmeasures as foreign bank flows into Asia turned to net inflows from outflows, while \nboth portfolio equity flows and carry trades accelerated and became more volatile and \nsensitive to developments in global equity markets. Global commodity and fuel prices \nrose dramatically as well beginning late 2006 until about the second quarter of 2008. \nPolicy makers became concerned with both adverse supply-side conditions and renewed \ninflationary pressures. The recent return of large capital flows to countries in Asia, given \nAsia\u2019s strong recovery from the global financial crisis and near-zero interest rates in \nEurope and the United States (US), has induced some countries in the region to utilize \nvarious forms of capital controls once again. \nCapital controls are seen as giving policy makers an extra degree of freedom to moderate \nthe volume and composition of capital flows. They could increase the policy space for \nusing expansionary monetary and fiscal policy to boost an economy without worsening \nthe external balance, reducing the prospects of destabilizing capital outflows especially \nduring periods of political instability.1 However, the macro context in which such controls \nhave been imposed by countries have differed and the effects of capital controls are \ndifficult to disentangle from those of other policies. \nThe evidence regarding the effectiveness of capital controls is mixed. In the 1990s, \ncapital controls were only temporarily able to drive a wedge between foreign and \ndomestic interest rates and to reduce pressures on the exchange rate in countries such \nas Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Malaysia, and Thailand (Ariyoshi et al. 2000). Furthermore, \nthese countries were unable to maintain interest rate differentials between foreign \n1  As Perkins and Woo (2000) point out, in Malaysia, the fear was that the political struggle between Mahathir and \nAnwar would result in capital flight and a collapse of the ringgit and the Malaysian stock market as had happened \nin Indonesia in May 1998 right before Soeharto stepped down. Malaysia imposed capital controls the day before \nAnwar was fired by Mahathir.", "2 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 251\nand domestic interest rates and reduce exchange rate pressures simultaneously. \nNevertheless, Malaysia and Thailand experienced less significant appreciations compared \nwith the other countries that used capital controls, and were able reduce the amount of \nshort-term inflows while lengthening maturities. \nThe apparent success of Malaysia in using capital controls during the Asian financial \ncrisis of 1997\u20131998 resurrected interest in their use in the postcrisis period when many \ncountries in Asia experienced both large capital inflows and currency appreciation. \nIn December 2006, as the baht (B) appreciated in the face of strong capital inflows, \nThailand imposed Chilean-style capital restrictions in the form of an unremunerated \nreserve requirement (URR) of a withholding tax of 30% on purchases of foreign currency \nexchanged for baht. In contrast with Malaysia\u2019s experience, the policy seems to have met \nwith less success. There was an immediate and large decline in the stock market index \nwhen the policy was announced; appreciation pressures on the baht continued unabated; \nand by 2008, the controls were lifted. Nevertheless, on 12 October 2010, in response \nonce again to large capital inflows and appreciation pressures on the baht, Thailand \nannounced a 15% witholding tax on capital gains and interest payments on government \nand state-owned company bonds. Malaysia, in contrast to Thailand and its own practice \nin the late 1990s, adopted capital account liberalization on both inflows and outflows in \n2000\u20132010. Therefore, the cases of Malaysia and Thailand seem to provide interesting \nbut contrasting experiences with the use of capital controls after the 1997 Asian financial \ncrisis.\nThis study examines the effectiveness of capital controls in Malaysia and Thailand \nover the period 2000\u20132010 using a vector auto-regression (VAR) model. One of the \nkey distinctions of our study is constructing de jure capital account restriction indexes \nas in Schindler (2009) and Binici et al. (2010) but using high-frequency information \non a monthly basis, published by the central banks to construct quarterly indexes. \nMost previous studies use annual information from the Annual Report on Exchange \nArrangement and Exchange Restrictions published by the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) to construct capital restriction indexes. Using highly aggregated information may \nfail to adequately capture changes in the frequency of usage or degree of restrictiveness, \nand thus give misleading results as to the effectiveness of such controls. In addition, \nthis study examines not only the effects of restrictions on the volume of capital flows \n(aggregate, inflows, and outflows), but also on particular asset categories of capital flows \n(portfolio, direct, and other investment flows). \nThe study is divided into the following sections. Section II describes capital account \npolicies in Malaysia and Thailand in the post-Asian financial crisis period. Section III \ndiscusses the methodology used to construct the capital control indexes in Malaysia \nand Thailand in this study. Section IV discusses the VAR model used to assess the \neffectiveness of capital control measures in Malaysia and Thailand, while Section V \npresents the results. Section VI concludes. Briefly, the results show that restrictions in ", "When are Capital Controls Effective? Evidence from Malaysia and Thailand | 3\nThailand have no significant effect on inflows but are especially effective for outflows, \nparticularly of foreign direct investment (FDI). In Malaysia, capital restrictions tend to \nhave a significant impact on inward FDI and portfolio inflows. Changes in capital account \nrestrictions do not have a significant impact on the real exchange rate in both Malaysia \nand Thailand.\nII. Capital Account Policies in Malaysia and Thailand\nMalaysia and Thailand had contrasting capital account policies after the Asian financial \ncrisis. Thailand introduced a number of capital restriction measures beginning 2003 to \ndiscourage net capital inflows and encourage net capital outflows. Malaysia, in contrast, \nintroduced strict capital control measures during the Asian crisis, but has gradually lifted \nthe restrictions since the early 2000s. \nDuring the Asian financial crisis, capital reversal in Malaysia was far less than in other \ncrisis-affected Asian countries (Figure 1:a.1). This may have resulted from the negative \nsentiment generated by the imposition of graduated exit levies on 15 February 1999. Net \ncapital inflows dropped noticeably in 2001, mainly because of the sharp decline in FDI \nas a result of the collapse of the dotcom bubble. Net capital outflows (asset side) started \nto gather momentum during the 1997 crisis period and has continuously increased since \nthen.\nAfter the Asian financial crisis, the Malaysian central bank began to liberalize capital \nrestrictions for all asset classes. Total net capital inflows improved in 2003\u20132004 as \nnonresidents invested in equities and bonds to speculate on the ringgit\u2019s appreciation. \nHowever, the ringgit appreciated only slightly and capital reversal was evident in all asset \nclasses except FDI in 2005. Capital inflows started to rise again in 2006\u20132007 before \ndeclining sharply in 2008 in response to the current global financial crisis. Foong (2008) \npointed out that during 2006\u20132007, there were some signs of speculative activity but the \ncentral bank did not impose any new capital restrictions to contain speculative capital \ninflows. The initial responses during that period included the sterilization of capital inflows, \nwith Bank Negara accumulating large amounts of reserves while increasing domestic \nliquidity significantly by 50.9 B ringgit (RM) to RM298.6 billion in 2007 (Kuang 2008, \n333). The prudential and regulatory framework was better aligned with international best \npractices because of fears of asset bubbles particularly in equity and property prices and \nin further strengthening of the domestic currency.

Foreign exchange administration rules \nwere liberalized so that individuals and corporations could invest more of their own \nfunds abroad. Investing companies that had no domestic ringgit borrowing were freely \nallowed to invest their own funds abroad. Prudential limits were only prescribed on large \ninvestments abroad if domestic credit facilities were used. In April 2007, the limit on a \nbank\u2019s foreign currency net open position equivalent to 20% percent of a bank\u2019s capital \nbase was abolished. This gave onshore banks greater flexibility to engage in the foreign \ncurrency business, allowing them to invest in all listed and unlisted shares and foreign \nequities. However, the limit for aggregate investments in shares and interest in shares \nwas kept at 25% of a bank\u2019s capital base (Kuang 2008, 338).", "When are Capital Controls Effective? Evidence from Malaysia and Thailand | 5\nThe global financial crisis affected domestic investors in Malaysia only slightly and there \nwas no sign of capital reversal in 2008 (Figure 1a.1). Most outward capital flows were \nin other investment flows and FDI while those in portfolio investment were negligible \n(Figure 1a.2). Foong (2008) argued that the key reason for the reluctance of domestic \ninvestors to invest abroad was possibly the lower returns abroad as well as a lack of \nrequisite investment skills by domestic financial institutions, despite the Malaysian central \nbank\u2019s continuous liberalization of capital restrictions for domestic investors in all asset \nclasses.\nIn Thailand, capital inflows started to gather momentum in 2003, reversing massive \noutflows experienced during the Asian financial crisis (Figure 1b.1). This was interrupted \nby the global financial crisis, which led to a slowdown in cross-border capital inflows \nin 2008. Nevertheless, the rapid economic recovery in Thailand has encouraged the \nresumption of large capital inflows since the second quarter of 2009, approximating \nthat of 2007 levels. Alongside the increase in capital inflows from 2003 to 2007, net \ncapital outflows also increased substantially in Thailand, reaching $17 billion in 2007 \n(Figure 1b.2). \nThe Bank of Thailand (BOT) worried about the appreciation of the baht from the influx \nof short-term capital inflows. The nominal exchange rate (baht per US dollar) began to \nappreciate beginning in 2001 with the influx of short-term capital into debt securities \n(Figure 2b). In 2003, the BOT announced a number of policy measures to relax \nrestrictions on capital outflows, aiming to offer alternative investment opportunities abroad \nand promote Thai residents\u2019 investment in foreign countries. Nevertheless, there was a \nsudden increase in total outstanding nonresident baht accounts, from the normal level \nof B18 billion in 2000\u20132002 to B63 billion in October 2003. The BOT imposed capital \nrestrictions for capital inflows and relaxed regulations for capital outflows originated by \nThai residents.\nThe continuing appreciation of the baht led the BOT to impose additional measures to \nguard against possible economic instability in 2006. Nevertheless, the pressures did not \nabate, and in December 2006, Chilean-style capital restrictions were introduced. Financial \ninstitutions were asked to withhold from their customers 30% of foreign currencies \npurchased or exchanged against the baht as URR to be deposited with the BOT.2 \nThe URR was eventually lifted in March 2008. Meanwhile, restrictions were imposed by \nthe BOT to guard against speculative capital flows and a rapid appreciation of the baht. \nOther measures for relaxing capital outflows imposed since 2006 were also maintained in \n2008\u20132010. \n2  Except for foreign exchange transactions related to trade in goods and services and to repatriation of investment \nabroad by residents and FDI.", "6 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 251\nFigure 2: Exchange Rates in Malaysia and Thailand, 1990\u20132009\n(a)  Malaysia\n4.5 150\n140\n4.0\n130\n3.5\n120\n110\n3.0\n100\n2.5\n90\n2.0 80\n1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09\nQ3\nExchange rate (RM/US$) REER (2005=100, right axis)\nb) Thailand\n50.0 140\n130\n45.0\n120\n40.0\n110\n35.0 100\n90\n30.0\n80\n25.0\n70\n20.0 60\n1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10\nQ3\nExchange rate (baht/US$) REER (2005=100, right axis)\nREER = real effective exchange rate.\nSources: International Financial Statistics, available: www.imfstatistics.org/IMF/logon.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fimf%2fimfbrowser.aspx%3\nfbranch%3dROOT&branch=ROOT; and Bank of International Settlements, available: www.bis.org/statistics/index.htm, both \ndownloaded July 2010.\nIII. Capital Control Indexes \nCapital control indexes are constructed for Malaysia and Thailand.3 To capture changes in \ncapital restrictions within a year, capital restriction indexes are constructed based on the \ninformation from notifications, press releases, and speeches related to foreign exchange \nand the capital account published formally by the central banks. \nMeasures are first divided into two categories, namely, those affecting net capital inflows \n(liabilities) and those affecting net capital outflows (assets). Within these two categories, \n3  Most previous studies construct l capital restriction indexes. See for example, Schindler (2009), Ito and Chinn (Ito \nand Chinn 2005), Mody and Murshid (2005), Miniane (2004), Johnston and Tamirisa (1998), and Tamirisa (1999).", "When are Capital Controls Effective? Evidence from Malaysia and Thailand | 7\nthe flows are further disaggregated into four types: FDI, equity securities, debt securities, \nand other investment flows (including foreign currency holdings and nonresident baht \naccounts).4\nThe capital control indexes are constructed by assigning \u201c+1\u201d or \u201c\u20131\u201d to each announced \nmeasure. Any measure that relaxes inflows and facilitates outflows is assigned \u201c+1\u201d, \nregardless of the source of the flows, whether residents or nonresidents. Any measure \nthat restricts inflows as well as outflows is assigned \u201c\u20131\u201d. The number is scaled by \ndifferent weights based on direct and indirect impact criteria. The weight is set at between \n0 and 2\u2014the higher the weight, the more severe the measure, especially from the policy \nmaker\u2019s point of view. For example, a measure designed to directly relax or block capital \nflows greater than $50 million is given a weight of \u201c2\u201d; if the flow is less than $5 million, \nthe weight assigned is \u201c0.5\u201d. In addition, a weight of \u201c0.25\u20130.5\u201d is given when the central \nbank changes the regulation slightly, and seeks the cooperation of or provides a particular \noption for investors, including financial institutions. The weight is increased to \u201c1\u201d when \nthe central bank requests and/or requires investors or financial institutions to undertake \ncertain measures. A weight of \u201c2\u201d is assigned when the central bank imposes a tax, the  \nURR, a two-tier market, or lifts certain policy measures.\nOnce the number (\u201c+1\u201d or \u201c\u20131\u201d) and weight have been assigned to every measure, \nthe numbers are sequentially accumulated over time to arrive at the indexes for each \nasset class.5 The indexes are re-scaled to lie between 0 and 1 to be able to compare \nthem with Schindler (2009) so that \u201c1\u201d represents capital restrictions and \u201c0\u201d represents \ncapital liberalization. The capital restriction indexes are constructed based on monthly \ninformation, and the simple average over 3 months is calculated to generate quarterly \nindexes.\nBefore the Asian financial crisis, capital restrictions for net capital inflows were eased \nsubstantially in Thailand, as shown by the decline in the index for total capital inflows \n(Figure 3c). This was largely due to the liberalization in financial institutions, while \nliberalization in other asset categories remained relatively limited. In the wake of the \nAsian financial crisis, however, the BOT reversed its policy. Capital restrictions were \nimposed on all asset types, except FDI, in 1997\u20131998, raising the indexes during the \ncrisis period. Some of these restrictions remained in place until early 2000.\nIn Malaysia, capital control indexes rose during the Asian financial crisis (Figure 3a). \nOn 1 September 1998, Malaysian authorities imposed new regulations to prevent the \noutflow of short-term capital and speculation on the ringgit. However, the degree of \ncapital restrictions for net capital inflows during this period tended to be higher than that \nin Thailand, since in February 1999, the Malaysian central bank imposed graduated exit \n4  A chronology of capital restriction and liberalization measures adopted in Malaysia and Thailand during 1990\u2013\n2010 is given in Appendix 1.\n5  Note that to be able to compare the control indexes across the asset types, the maximum accumulation value of a \nparticular asset type is used as a base for the index.", "8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 251\nlevies to discourage foreign investors to bring capital out of the country swiftly. Since \nthen, the central bank has gradually liberalized the restrictions, e.g., the exit levy on \nprofit repatriated after 1 year from the month the profits are realized was abolished and \nonly portfolio profits repatriated within 1 year remained subject to the 10% levy. Capital \ncontrol indexes for all asset classes, especially other investment (banking flows), have \ncontinuously declined as shown in Figures 3a and 3b.\nFigure 3: Capital Restriction Indexes by Asset Classes, 1990Q1\u20132010Q2 \nMalaysia\n(a) Net Capital Inflows (b) Net Capital Outflows\n \n1.0 1.0\n \n0.8 0.8\n0.6 0.6\n0.4 0.4\n0.2 0.2\n0.0 0.0\n1990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 06 08 10 1990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 06 08 10\nQ1 Q1\nTotal Index FDI Total Index FDI\nEquity Debt Equity Debt\nBank Bank\nThailand\n \n(c) Net Capital Inflows (d) Net Capital Outflows\n1.0 1.0\n0.8 0.8\n0.6 0.6\n0.4 0.4\n0.2 0.2\n0.0 0.0\n1990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 06 08 10 1990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 06 08 10\nQ1 Q1\nFDI Equity FDI Equity\nDebt Bank Debt Bank\nTotal Index Total Index\nFDI = foreign direct investment.\nNote:   The higher the index, the greater the degree of capital restrictions. \nSource:  Authors\u2019 calculation based on Schindler (2009).", "When are Capital Controls Effective? Evidence from Malaysia and Thailand | 9\nBecause of the continued influx of short-term capital into debt securities, as well as the \nnoticeable appreciation of the baht in 2006, additional restrictive measures, including \nthe URR, were introduced. These are reflected in the noticeable rise in capital restriction \nindexes in 2006, especially in terms of debt securities and financial institutions. \nControls on capital inflows were relaxed gradually in 2007 and eventually the URR was \nlifted in March 2008, leading to a decline in capital restriction indexes in 2007\u20132008. \nNevertheless, certain restrictive measures imposed by the BOT were maintained, so that \nthe capital restriction indexes during the last 3 years, especially for debt securities, have \nremained relatively high compared to those in early 2000 (Figures 3c and 3d). \nPolicy measures to relax restrictions on outflows, both of FDI and portfolio investment, \nwere subsequently announced after 2003 in Thailand. In particular, exchange control \nregulations on investment in securities abroad were relaxed in 2006. The capital control \nindexes shown in Figure 3d point to the progressive relaxation of restrictions on capital \noutflows in terms of FDI, equity, and debt securities, offering investment opportunities \nabroad for Thai residents. In Malaysia, liberalization of net capital outflows occurred \nearlier (Figure 3b). In particular, other investment outflows have been gradually liberalized \nsince the late 1990s, while other flows have shown noticeable liberalization in the early \n2000s. \nIV. Assessing Effectiveness of Capital Restrictions \nTo assess the effectiveness of capital restrictions, a VAR model is applied using quarterly \ndata for 2000\u20132010.6 The data before and during the Asian financial crisis (1990\u20131996 \nand 1997\u20131999) were excluded because of data limitations for Malaysia. For Thailand, \nthe objectives of introducing policy measures during these two periods differ from those \nin 2000\u20132010. During 1990\u20131996, most measures were aimed at liberalizing capital and \nfinancial markets; during the crisis period, measures were targeted at stopping capital \noutflows; during 2000\u20132010, the measures were generally intended to control capital \ninflows. \nSince the central banks introduced measures aimed not only at affecting capital inflows, \nbut also at encouraging residents to invest overseas, the VAR model is applied separately \nto net capital inflows and net capital outflows. To clearly examine the effects of measures \nthat restrict or relax capital flows, especially the switching effect, the model is applied \nnot only to total capital flows, but also to the different assets classes, i.e., FDI, portfolio \ninvestment, and other investment flows (mainly bank flows). Note that in Thailand, for \nthe liability side, since the central bank excluded equity security and FDI when imposing \ncapital restrictions, net portfolio investment inflows were disaggregated into equity and \n6  Note that for Malaysia, because of data limitation on capital flows, the VAR model is performed during 2000\u20132008.", "10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 251\ndebt securities to clearly examine the effectiveness of capital restrictions, especially the \nswitching effect that may occur among debt, equity, and bank inflows.7 All in all, there are \nfive endogenous variables in the VAR model. \n(i) Capital flows\nFor the liability side, capital flows (seasonally adjusted) are divided into the following.\n  TIF  = total net capital inflows (percent of gross domestic product [GDP])\n  IFDI  = net foreign direct investment inflows (percent of GDP)\n  IPORT  = net portfolio investment inflows (percent of GDP)\n  IEQUITY =  net equity investment inflows (percent of GDP)\n  IDEBT  = net debt security investment inflows (percent of GDP)\n  Iother  = net other investment inflows (percent of GDP) \nFor the asset side, capital flows (seasonally adjusted) are divided as follows.\n  TOF  = total net capital outflows (percent of GDP)\n  OFDI  = outward foreign direct investment (percent of GDP)\n  OPORT  = net portfolio outflows (percent of GDP)\n  Oother  = net other investment outflows (percent of GDP)\nNote that to be able to interpret the results easily, a positive sign is assigned to all \nasset types of capital outflows. A higher positive value implies a larger volume of capital \noutflows.\n7  Note that in a case of Malaysia, the results are not significantly different between debt and equity securities in \nresponse to capital relaxation.", "When are Capital Controls Effective?

Results\nFigure 4 shows the impulse responses of key variables to a 1 standard deviation increase \nin capital restriction indexes for Malaysia and Thailand (see Tables 1a and 1b for the \nregression results of Malaysia, and Tables 2a and 2b for Thailand). The tightening \n(relaxation) of capital restrictions on the liabilities side in Malaysia tends to have a \nsignificantly negative (positive) impact on inward FDI and portfolio investment inflows, as \nreflected in the negative relationship between these flows (IFDI and IPORT) and capital \ncontrol indexes (TIFC). The effect peaks in the second quarter for both types of inflows \nbut the effects tend to last longer for FDI\u201410 quarters compared with six quarters for \nportfolio investment. It is plausible that after the Asian financial crisis, financial institutions \nbecame cautious about excessive use of bank-sourced inflows so that the responses of \nthe flows to capital relaxation are relatively limited.", "When are Capital Controls Effective? Evidence from Malaysia and Thailand | 13\nMeanwhile, there is no significant impact of changes in capital account policy on the real \nexchange rate. This could be a result of the exchange rate policy itself. Although the \ncentral bank moved toward managed floating exchange rate regime after 2006, changes \nin exchange rate so far have been limited and the central bank continued to influence \nmovements in the exchange rate.\nOn the assets side, the relaxation of capital outflows tends to encourage outward FDI in \nMalaysia as shown by the negative impulse response in Figures 4a\u20134b (i.e., note that the \nlower the index, the greater the degree of capital relaxation). \nIn Thailand, on the liabilities side, the impulse response in Figures 4c\u20134d clearly shows \nan increase in total capital inflows, although it is statistically insignificant, after the \nimposition of capital restrictions. The impact peaks in the second quarter before dying \ndown within six quarters. Composition switching tends to emerge from imposing such \ncapital restrictions. The impulse response shows that equity inflows increase with the \npositive shock of capital restrictions, reach a peak in the second quarter, and gradually \ndecline within five quarters. FDI inflows slightly increase but the impact is statistically \ninsignificant. Because of the switching effect, appreciation of the exchange rate is evident, \nbut statistically insignificant, in response to the imposition of certain types of capital \ninflows. Along with the appreciation of the real exchange rate, a negative relationship \nbetween capital restrictions and the MPI is found in this study (Appendix 2).\nFigure 4: Impulse Responses of Key Variables to Capital Restriction\na.

The positive sign is assigned \nfor all asset types of capital inflows and outflows. A higher (lower) capital control index represents a more (less) restrictive \ncapital outflow and inflow policy. Thus, for example, the negative relationship between capital outflows and capital outflow \npolicy (TOFC) implies that relaxation in capital outflow control tends to increase net capital outflows.\nIn general, the design of capital restrictions is crucial in meeting the goals of the central \nbank. In the case of Thailand, capital restrictions could, to some extent, limit the inflows \nof short-term capital. But the restrictions evidently do not help reduce the appreciation \npressure on the real exchange rate because of a switching effect. Hence, imposing \ncapital restrictions should be done with caution since such restrictions could hurt the ", "When are Capital Controls Effective? Evidence from Malaysia and Thailand | 17\nproduction side of the economy, as shown by the negative impact of the restrictions on \nthe MPI.\nOn the assets side, a relaxation of overall capital restrictions helps to encourage Thai \nresidents to invest overseas. This is reflected in the negative relationship of TOFC (i.e., \nthe lower the index, the greater the degree of capital relaxation) with total capital outflows \n(Figure 4b). The impact of a relaxation of restrictions on capital outflows is highest in \nthe second quarter before dying down within a year. The relaxation of overall restrictions \non capital outflows helps to encourage investors to invest overseas, mostly in the form \nof FDI, while the effects on portfolio and other investment outflows are statistically \ninsignificant. The impulse responses also show that portfolio and other investment \noutflows have a slower response to the relaxation of restrictions than FDI, with the peak \noccurring in the third quarter for the former two flows compared to the second quarter for \nFDI. The standard deviations associated with the former outflows are also far wider than \nthat associated with FDI. \nWhile cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have become more important in \ntotal FDI outflows,10 our results show that in addition to the relaxation of outward FDI \npolicy, liberalization in other asset types, especially equity and debt securities, helps \nfirms undertake outward FDI. This is because in addition to cash, issuing common stocks \nor the exchange of stocks have recently become popular modes of payments for M&A \ntransactions. Relaxing restrictions on outward FDI per se would have a smaller impact on \nencouraging FDI outflows. \nThe impulse response also shows that a relaxation of capital outflow restrictions (i.e., a \ndecline in TOFC) gives rise to an appreciation of the real exchange rate (i.e., an increase \nin the REER index), although it is statistically insignificant. The slow responses of portfolio \nand other investment outflows could be one of the reasons for such an appreciation. \nThe MPI tends to respond negatively (positively) and significantly to the overall relaxation \n(tightening) of restrictions on capital outflows as shown in Appendix 2. This result is also \nfound in the case of Malaysia. The negative relationship may arise from the fact that as \ninvestment (both quantity and quality) in these countries is still relatively low after the \nAsian financial crisis, encouraging capital outflows at this stage may only encourage \nthe country to recycle savings without the necessary structural adjustments in economic \nfundamentals. Thus, the efficient use of savings (capital) to improve both the quantity \nand quality of investment in these countries is needed, in addition to a well-designed \nliberalization policy to encourage de facto capital outflows.\n10 M&A has become an important form of outward FDI. In 2008, more than 50% of total outward FDI from Thailand \nwas in the form of M&As.", "18 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 251\nTable 1a: Estimation Results for Net Capital Inflows (Liability) in Malaysia\n\u00a0 D(TIF_SA) D(IFDI_SA) D(IPORT_SA) D(Iother_SA)\nD(TIF_SA(-1)) -0.491686\n[-3.25288]*\nD(IFDI_SA(-1)) -0.817856\n[-5.22647]*\nD(IPORT_SA(-1)) -0.483119\n[-3.88388]*\nD(Iother_SA(-1)) -0.409287\n[-2.31487]*\nDLOG(REER(-1)) 0.22644 0.195165 0.117421 0.100407\n[ 0.24864] [ 0.94593] [ 0.21333] [ 0.32648]\nDLOG(RGDPMALAY(-1)) -0.873608 0.398554 -0.336928 -0.046923\n[-0.57525] [ 1.17272]*** [-0.36547] [-0.09453]\nD(RINTERESTGTB(-1)) 0.00026 2.01E-05 0.004636 -0.000498\n[ 0.01473] [ 0.00511] [ 0.42261] [-0.07722]\nD(TIFC(-1)) -0.512218 -0.185456 -0.787753 -0.187274\n[-0.44459] [-1.58787]** [-1.13481]*** [-0.92152]\nC -0.019972 -0.008027 1.75E-05 -0.017244\n[-0.61295] [-1.21885]*** [ 0.00089] [-1.67585]**\nDLOG(RGDPG3) 2.137705 -0.023073 0.526439 0.979027\n[ 1.92322]* [-0.09366] [ 0.79481] [ 2.55187]*\nDLOG(SHAREUSA) 0.0035 0.148208 -0.045271 0.094586\n\u00a0 [ 0.01189] [ 2.12014]* [-0.25621] [ 0.91838]\n R-squared 0.472633 0.533544 0.673364 0.47165\n Adj.

Conclusion\nThis study uses VAR estimation to examine the impact of higher-frequency indexes \nof capital controls in Malaysia and Thailand. Thailand introduced a number of capital \nrestriction measures since 2003 to discourage net capital inflows as well as encourage \nnet capital outflows. In contrast, Malaysia, which introduced strict capital control measures \nduring the 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis, has gradually lifted the restrictions since the \nearly 2000s. \nWe find that restrictions in Thailand have no significant effect on the volume of inflows, \nbut are especially effective for outflows, particularly FDI. In Malaysia, capital restrictions \ntend to have a significant impact on the volume of inward FDI and portfolio inflows. \nCapital controls have been used not only to reduce capital inflows or change the \ncomposition of capital flows, but also to achieve other goals such as to prevent the \nformation of asset bubbles, curb exchange rate appreciation, and allow more monetary \npolicy independence. Results obtained in this study show that changes in capital account \nrestrictions do not have a significant impact on the real exchange rate in both Malaysia \nand Thailand.\nOur results imply that, unless carefully designed, the intent of policy makers using capital \ncontrol measures to deter short-term disruptive inflows may not be successful. Even \nwhen they are effective, the effects are likely to be only temporary. The more effective \nand permanent way to shift the composition of foreign capital to less volatile longer-term \ninflows is to improve the investment climate and develop domestic financial markets \nincluding local currency bond markets.

The results show that capital restrictions \nintroduced in Thailand have no significant effect on inflows, but liberalization of \noutflows is effective in both Malaysia and Thailand. In addition, capital controls is found \nto have no impact on real exchange rates in both countries.  \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople.

ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional \nintegration. \n  Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
