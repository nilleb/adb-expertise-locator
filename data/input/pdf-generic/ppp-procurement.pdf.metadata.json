VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\ntransparency\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\nefficiency Quality Flexibility\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction  \u2022\tContract management  \u2022\tOpen competitive \ncosts support bidding\n\u2022\tIncreased skills \u2022\tPrompt resolution of  \u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level  complaints \u2022\tAccreditation \ntechnology usage \u2022\tImproved developing  for alternative \n\u2022\tImproved  member country  procurement \nprocurement planning procurement process  arrangements\n\u2022\tSupport and  \u2022\tImproved  \u2022\tPrinciples-based \nencouragement  procurement planning decisions\nof e-procurement  \u2022\tGovernance \u2022\tImproved \nsystems \u2022\tContracts with clear  procurement planning\nperformance criteria \u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tMinimal number of  \u2022\tBids with weighted  \ncomplaints proposal  \n\u2022\tImproved ADB  criteria \nprocesses \nFairness\ntime\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.", "About This Publication vii\nobjective\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \nLiving Document\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\nthe reader \nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs.

Definition of Public\u2013Private Partnerships\n2.1  A PPP refers to a long-term contractual arrangement between public \n(national, state, provincial, or local) and private entities through which the skills, \nassets, and/or financial resources of each of the public and private sectors are \nallocated in a complementary manner\u2014thereby sharing the risks and rewards, to \nseek to provide optimal service delivery and good value to citizens. \n2.2  PPPs may be characterized by the following four elements:\n(i)  Duration. Contracts between public and private sector partners are \nusually medium- to long-term, often covering the lifetime of the asset \nbeing produced under the PPP contract.\n(ii)  Financing, responsibilities, and ownership. Asset financing by the \npublic and/or private sector is often complex and can involve revenues \nobtained from the operation of the asset over a designated period. \nResponsibility for constructing, operating, and maintaining the asset \ncan often be included in the responsibilities of the private partner. \nOwnership of the asset varies by PPP arrangement. In some cases, \nthe private sector operator owns the asset and transfers ownership \nto the public sector partner after a designated period. In other cases, \nownership is shared or may be retained by the public sector partner \nover the life of the asset.\n(iii) Performance-based returns. PPPs develop assets or projects for \nthe purpose of delivering ongoing services to the public, rather \nthan the asset being the deliverable of the contract, with payment \nbeing contingent on the operator of the asset meeting performance \nstandards. The public sector partner is usually responsible for \nmonitoring performance over the life of the contract.\n(iv) Output and quality specification. The private sector partner \nparticipates in stages of the project defined by the public sector \npartner (e.g., design, construction, operation, maintenance, and \nfinancing). The public sector partner defines the outcomes to be \nachieved in terms of public interest, quality of services provided, \nand\u00a0pricing policy.", "4 Public\u2013Private Partnerships\nB.   Applicability of Core Procurement Principles\n2.3  The six core procurement principles stated in the ADB Procurement \nPolicy: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting, and Consulting Services (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time)\u2014economy, efficiency, fairness, transparency, quality, and value \nfor money (VFM)\u2014all apply to PPP procurement. Although the nature of PPP \nprocurement is different from conventional procurement of goods, works, and \nservices, the process for procuring PPPs should be designed and implemented to \ncomply with these principles.\n2.4  VFM in PPP projects is achieved through the leveraging of private sector \nefficiency, effectiveness, and economy, and through the appropriate allocation of \nrisks.\n2.5  The factors that determine whether a project delivers VFM will vary by \ntype of project, sector, and country. In general, PPPs can generate improved VFM \nfor the procuring authority in several ways, including\n(i)  reduced total cost of ownership (whole life cycle costs),\n(ii)  better allocation of risks,\n(iii) streamlined and efficient project implementation,\n(iv) improved quality of service, and\n(v)  potential to unlock additional revenue streams. \n2.6  More information on VFM in PPP projects can be found in the ADB \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020.1\n1  ADB. 2012.

", "iii.\u2003Key Considerations in Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Procurement\n3.1  PPP projects vary from traditional projects in several important ways, \nwhich affect the procurement approach and procurement methods. These include \nthe following:\n(i)  PPP contracts are usually long-term and the environment in which \nthe PPP operates over the life of the partnership can change in \nunforeseen ways. This may require the selection of criteria used to \nevaluate proposals that are different from those used in conventional \nprocurement, in which requirements over the life of the contract are \nmore clearly known.\n(ii)  PPP contracts generally involve the private sector partner constructing \nthe asset and then operating and maintaining it. The public sector \npartner usually specifies requirements in terms of outputs, e.g., \nmegawatts of power output of a power plant, rather than the \nconventional procurement approach of specifying inputs, such as the \nspecifications of the type and size of plant.\n(iii) The private sector operator will generally have an equity stake in the \nentity (special purpose vehicle or project company) that will procure \nthe asset, and will receive or share revenue generated by the asset, \nrather than the conventional procurement approach of being paid for \nprovision of goods or services or for the construction of an asset. This \nchanges the balance of risk in the relationship and the nature of the \ncontract management task over the course of the contract. \n3.2  Despite these significant differences, the process used to procure a PPP \narrangement has similar steps with conventional procurement. The steps in PPP \nprocurement include those described in the ADB procurement cycle (see Figure), \nincluding procurement planning, bidding, bid evaluation, contract award, and \ncontract implementation and management.\nA.   Procurement Planning\n3.3  Section 7 of the ADB Public\u2013Private Partnership Handbook notes that the \nprocurement method will depend on the government\u2019s budget, capacity, desire to \nencourage innovation, need for high-level inputs, vulnerability to corruption, and ", "6 Public\u2013Private Partnerships\nFigure: The ADB Procurement Cycle\nCountry Partnership \nStrategy\nCountry and Sector/Agency \nProcurement Risk Assessment\nFeedback or Evaluation\nProject Conceptualization\nProject Completion Report\nTransaction Technical Assistance \nContract Close \nLessons Learned Q uality Econom Procurement Risk Categorization\ny\ncy Tra Procurement Planning \nImplementation and n n Procurement Plan\nContract Management e PROCUREMENT sp Project Procurement Risk \nContract Management Plan icffi CYCLE nera Project AAdmssiensissmtraetniot n Manual\nE c\ny\nMVoanlueey for Fairness\nContract Award Bidding\nBidding Documents\nBid Evaluation\nEvaluation Reports\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\nobjectives of the PPP project.2 It notes the three main options of (i) unsolicited \nproposals or direct negotiations (\u201csole sourcing\u201d), (ii) competitive negotiations, and \n(iii) competitive bidding. \n3.4  In the case of unsolicited proposals, decisions may need to be made about \nthe procurement approach in place of (or as part of) the procurement planning \nstage of the ADB procurement cycle.\n3.5  The Public\u2013Private Partnerships Reference Guide, developed by a \ncollaboration of multilateral development banks, also provides information on \nconsiderations when deciding the procurement strategy, including (i) whether to \nuse prequalification; (ii) whether to use a single-stage or multistage bid process; \n2  ADB. 2008.
