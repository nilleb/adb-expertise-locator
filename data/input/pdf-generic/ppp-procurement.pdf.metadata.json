These replace the former Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The procurement policy and the \nprocurement regulations address the procurement activities of project executing \nagencies and implementing agencies on projects financed in whole or in part by a \nloan or grant from ADB, or by ADB-administered funds. ADB designed the 2017 \nprocurement policy to deliver significant benefits and flexibility throughout the \nproject procurement cycle, as well as to improve project delivery through a renewed \nfocus on the concepts of quality, value for money (VFM), and fitness for purpose.\n\nThis note is part of a series of guidance notes published by ADB in 2018 to \naccompany the 2017 procurement policy and the procurement regulations. \nEach\u00a0note discusses a topical issue for borrowers (including grant recipients), \nbidders, and civil society under the new framework (see list below). The guidance \nnotes cross-reference each other frequently and should be read in conjunction. \nAll\u00a0references to \u201cguidance notes\u201d pertain to these notes.

VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\n\nt r a n sparency\n\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\n\nefficiency\n\nQuality\n\nFlexibility\n\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction \n\n\u2022\tContract management \n\n\u2022\tOpen competitive \n\ncosts\n\nsupport\n\n\u2022\tIncreased skills\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level \ntechnology usage\n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tPrompt resolution of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved developing \n\nmember country \nprocurement process \n\n\u2022\tSupport and \n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nencouragement \nof e-procurement \nsystems\n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tGovernance\n\u2022\tContracts with clear \nperformance criteria\n\u2022\tMinimal number of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved ADB \n\nprocesses \n\nFairnes s\n\nbidding\n\n\u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tAccreditation \nfor alternative \nprocurement \narrangements\n\u2022\tPrinciples-based \n\ndecisions\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tBids with weighted  \n\nproposal  \ncriteria \n\ntime\n\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \n\nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.\n\n\fAbout This Publication\n\nvii\n\nobjective\n\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \n\nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \n\nLiving Document\n\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nthe reader \n\nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs. For consistency throughout the suite of guidance notes, the following \nassumption is made about the reader:\n\nThe reader is a professional involved in activities financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan \nor grant, or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nFAQs\n\nFrequently asked questions, clarifications, examples, additional information, links to training, \nand other useful resources will be made available on the ADB website. \n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for more information,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nLegal and order of Priority\n\nThis guidance note explains and elaborates on the provisions of the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services \n(2017, as amended from time to time) applicable to executing (and implementing) agencies \nunder sovereign (including subsovereign) projects financed in whole or in part by an \ninvestment loan from ADB (i.e., excluding ADB results- or policy-based loans),  \nADB-financed grant (excluding ADB-administered technical assistance and staff \nconsultancies), or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nIn the event of any discrepancy between this guidance note and the procurement \nregulations, the latter will prevail. The financing agreement governs the legal relationships \nbetween the borrower and ADB. The rights and obligations between the borrower and the \nprovider of goods, works, or services are governed by the specific procurement document \nissued by the borrower and by the contract signed between the borrower and the provider, \nand not by this guidance note.\n\n\fviii\n\nABBreViAtions\n\nADB \n\nPPP \n\nVFM \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\nAsian Development Bank\n\npublic\u2013private partnership\n\nvalue for money\n\n\fexeCutiVe suMMAry\n\nix\n\nThis guidance note applies to the selection of public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \noperators for sovereign lending operations only.

Although the nature of PPP procurement is different \nfrom the conventional procurement of goods, works, and services, the process \nfor procuring PPPs should be designed and implemented to comply with these \nprinciples.\n\nA PPP refers to a long-term contractual arrangement between public (national, \nstate, provincial, or local) and private entities through which skills, assets, and/or  \nfinancial resources of each of the public and private sectors are allocated in a \ncomplementary manner\u2014thereby sharing the risks and rewards, to seek to provide \noptimal service delivery, and good value to citizens.\n\nPPPs may be characterized as follows:\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\nlong duration,\ncomplex financing,\nlife cycle responsibilities managed by the private sector partner,\nperformance-based returns, and\noutput-specified. \n\nVFM in PPP projects is achieved through the leveraging of private sector efficiency, \neffectiveness, and economy, and through the appropriate allocation of risks.\n\nDespite PPP projects being different in nature from conventional projects, \nthe\u00a0procurement process is similar, comprising planning, bidding, bid evaluation, \ncontract award, and implementation. The methods used in each of these steps \nvary\u00a0from conventional procurement because of the nature of PPP projects, \nbeing\u00a0long-term and output-focused.\n\nExtensive literature on PPP procurement is publicly available from ADB, the World \nBank, other multilateral development banks, APM Group International, and others.\n\n\f\fi.\u2003introduction\n\nA.  \n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this guidance note is to describe the procurement \n\n1.1 \nprinciples applying to public\u2013private partnerships (PPP), to highlight particular \nconsiderations in PPP procurement, and to provide references to some of \nthe extensive literature available on PPP establishment, procurement, and \nmanagement.\n\nB.  \n\nScope\n\n1.2 \nseveral ways:\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports PPP arrangements in \n\n(i) \n\ntechnical assistance, aimed at enabling and preparing PPPs by \nfostering policy and regulatory reforms, capacity building, and project \npreparation studies;\n\n(ii)  transaction advisory services to (a) government entities engaged in \n\nthe design, preparation, and procurement of PPPs; and (b) private \nsector operators;\n\n(iii)  sovereign lending operations to governments to finance their \n\nparticipation in PPPs;\n\n(iv)  nonsovereign lending operations directly to private sector operators or \nindirectly to financial intermediaries that will, in turn, finance private \nsector investors;\n\n(v)  equity investments to private sector operators, either as an investment \nin a company (or a holding company) that, in turn, takes an equity \nparticipation in a special purpose vehicle, or directly as an equity \nparticipation in a special purpose vehicle; and\n\n(vi)  guarantees to cover political risks or both political and credit risks. \n\n1.3 \nThis guidance note applies to the selection of a PPP operator, where the \nproject is jointly cofinanced by ADB through its sovereign financing window only. \n\n\f2\n\nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships\n\n1.4 \n\nThis guidance note does not apply to\n\n(i)  nonsovereign operations;\n(ii)  procurement of goods, works, and services by the private operator \nselected to implement the PPP contract (sometimes known as \n\u201cdownstream\u201d procurement);\n\n(iii)  transaction advisory services provided by ADB to borrowers, public \n\nsector entities, and private sector operators; and\n\n(iv)  regional project preparation facilities, country-specific project \n\ndevelopment facilities, and project preparation facilities resulting from \nADB technical assistance and sovereign lending.\n\n\fii.\u2003Procurement Principles\n\nA.   Definition of Public\u2013Private Partnerships\n\nA PPP refers to a long-term contractual arrangement between public \n\n2.1 \n(national, state, provincial, or local) and private entities through which the skills, \nassets, and/or financial resources of each of the public and private sectors are \nallocated in a complementary manner\u2014thereby sharing the risks and rewards, to \nseek to provide optimal service delivery and good value to citizens. \n\n2.2 \n\nPPPs may be characterized by the following four elements:\n\n(i)  Duration. Contracts between public and private sector partners are \n\nusually medium- to long-term, often covering the lifetime of the asset \nbeing produced under the PPP contract.\n\n(ii)  Financing, responsibilities, and ownership. Asset financing by the \n\npublic and/or private sector is often complex and can involve revenues \nobtained from the operation of the asset over a designated period. \nResponsibility for constructing, operating, and maintaining the asset \ncan often be included in the responsibilities of the private partner. \nOwnership of the asset varies by PPP arrangement. In some cases, \nthe private sector operator owns the asset and transfers ownership \nto the public sector partner after a designated period. In other cases, \nownership is shared or may be retained by the public sector partner \nover the life of the asset.\n\n(iii)  Performance-based returns. PPPs develop assets or projects for \nthe purpose of delivering ongoing services to the public, rather \nthan the asset being the deliverable of the contract, with payment \nbeing contingent on the operator of the asset meeting performance \nstandards. The public sector partner is usually responsible for \nmonitoring performance over the life of the contract.\n\n(iv)  Output and quality specification. The private sector partner \n\nparticipates in stages of the project defined by the public sector \npartner (e.g., design, construction, operation, maintenance, and \nfinancing). The public sector partner defines the outcomes to be \nachieved in terms of public interest, quality of services provided, \nand\u00a0pricing policy.\n\n\f4\n\nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships\n\nB.  \n\nApplicability of Core Procurement Principles\n\nThe six core procurement principles stated in the ADB Procurement \n\n2.3 \nPolicy: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting, and Consulting Services (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time)\u2014economy, efficiency, fairness, transparency, quality, and value \nfor money (VFM)\u2014all apply to PPP procurement. Although the nature of PPP \nprocurement is different from conventional procurement of goods, works, and \nservices, the process for procuring PPPs should be designed and implemented to \ncomply with these principles.\n\nVFM in PPP projects is achieved through the leveraging of private sector \n2.4 \nefficiency, effectiveness, and economy, and through the appropriate allocation of \nrisks.\n\n2.5 \nThe factors that determine whether a project delivers VFM will vary by \ntype of project, sector, and country. In general, PPPs can generate improved VFM \nfor the procuring authority in several ways, including\n\nreduced total cost of ownership (whole life cycle costs),\n\n(i) \n(ii)  better allocation of risks,\n(iii)  streamlined and efficient project implementation,\n(iv)  improved quality of service, and\n(v)  potential to unlock additional revenue streams. \n\n2.6 \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020.1\n\nMore information on VFM in PPP projects can be found in the ADB \n\n1  ADB. 2012. Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan 2012\u20132020. Manila. https://www.adb.org/\n\ndocuments/public-private-partnership-operational-plan-2012-2020. \n\n\fiii.\u2003Key Considerations in Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Procurement\n\nPPP projects vary from traditional projects in several important ways, \n\n3.1 \nwhich affect the procurement approach and procurement methods. These include \nthe following:\n\n(i)  PPP contracts are usually long-term and the environment in which \nthe PPP operates over the life of the partnership can change in \nunforeseen ways. This may require the selection of criteria used to \nevaluate proposals that are different from those used in conventional \nprocurement, in which requirements over the life of the contract are \nmore clearly known.\n\n(ii)  PPP contracts generally involve the private sector partner constructing \nthe asset and then operating and maintaining it. The public sector \npartner usually specifies requirements in terms of outputs, e.g., \nmegawatts of power output of a power plant, rather than the \nconventional procurement approach of specifying inputs, such as the \nspecifications of the type and size of plant.\n\n(iii)  The private sector operator will generally have an equity stake in the \nentity (special purpose vehicle or project company) that will procure \nthe asset, and will receive or share revenue generated by the asset, \nrather than the conventional procurement approach of being paid for \nprovision of goods or services or for the construction of an asset. This \nchanges the balance of risk in the relationship and the nature of the \ncontract management task over the course of the contract. \n\nDespite these significant differences, the process used to procure a PPP \n3.2 \narrangement has similar steps with conventional procurement. The steps in PPP \nprocurement include those described in the ADB procurement cycle (see Figure), \nincluding procurement planning, bidding, bid evaluation, contract award, and \ncontract implementation and management.\n\nA.  \n\nProcurement Planning\n\nSection 7 of the ADB Public\u2013Private Partnership Handbook notes that the \n\n3.3 \nprocurement method will depend on the government\u2019s budget, capacity, desire to \nencourage innovation, need for high-level inputs, vulnerability to corruption, and \n\n\f6\n\nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships\n\nFigure: The ADB Procurement Cycle\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nobjectives of the PPP project.2 It notes the three main options of (i) unsolicited \nproposals or direct negotiations (\u201csole sourcing\u201d), (ii) competitive negotiations, and \n(iii) competitive bidding. \n\nIn the case of unsolicited proposals, decisions may need to be made about \n\n3.4 \nthe procurement approach in place of (or as part of) the procurement planning \nstage of the ADB procurement cycle.\n\nThe Public\u2013Private Partnerships Reference Guide, developed by a \n\n3.5 \ncollaboration of multilateral development banks, also provides information on \nconsiderations when deciding the procurement strategy, including (i) whether to \nuse prequalification; (ii) whether to use a single-stage or multistage bid process; \n\n2  ADB. 2008.
