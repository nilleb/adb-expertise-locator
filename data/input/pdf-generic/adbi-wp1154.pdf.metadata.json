To do so, we conducted a survey on financial \nliteracy and fintech awareness and adoption, using financial literacy questions to calculate a \nfinancial literacy score.

INTRODUCTION \nFinancial  literacy has  gained  an  important  position  in  the  policy  agenda of  many \ncountries, and the importance of collecting informative, reliable data on the levels of \nfinancial literacy across the adult population has been widely recognized (OECD/INFE \n2015b). This parallels the emphasis placed on increasing financial inclusion, i.e., the \naccess of individuals and firms to financial products and services. If individuals do not \nunderstand financial principles, they will not be able to profit from such increased access. \nAlso, the trend of switching to defined-contribution plans from defined-benefit pension \nplans implies that individuals will increasingly need to manage their own retirement \nsavings and pensions. At their summit in Los Cabos, Mexico in 2012, Group of Twenty \n(G20)  leaders  endorsed  the  High-Level  Principles  on  National  Strategies  \nfor Financial Education developed by the OECD/INFE, thereby acknowledging the \nimportance of coordinated policy approaches to financial education (G20 2012). At the \nsame time, surveys consistently show that the level of financial literacy is relatively low, \neven in advanced economies (OECD/INFE 2016, 2017, 2018). This indicates that the \nneed for higher levels of financial literacy is increasing. \nRapid developments in financial technology (fintech) also highlight the need to improve \nfinancial literacy in order to use innovative financial products and services. With the \ndevelopment  of  information\u2013communication  technology  (ICT),  there  is  a  growing  \nbreed of fintech companies that provide services through internet- and mobile-based \nplatforms such as Ant Financial (People\u2019s Republic of China), Grab (Singapore), Paytm \n(India), Compass (US), and Opendoor (UK). Recent literature has shown that fintech \n(especially mobile money) has helped to increase financial inclusion in developing \neconomies  where  the  traditional  bank-based  financial  system  is  underdeveloped \n(Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018). Other studies have identified factors that affect the adoption \nof mobile- and internet-based financial services (Jack, Ray, and Suri 2013; Suri 2017). \nHowever, we are not aware of any papers that investigate the role of financial literacy on \nthe awareness and/or use of fintech products.  \nThis paper attempts to fill this gap by using newly collected data in a developing country, \nViet Nam. Our research question is whether those with a higher level of financial literacy \nare more likely to be aware of and use fintech products. To answer this question, we \nconstruct a financial literacy1 score based on the approach of the OECD/INFE (2015a, \n2015c) and use both ordinary least squares (OLS) and Heckman two-step procedure \nestimation. We find that higher financial literacy is significantly related to both awareness \nand adoption of fintech products. Therefore, improvements in financial literacy could \nspeed the adoption of fintech products and services, and thereby promote financial \ninclusion. \nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some background on fintech \ndevelopment in general, and in Viet Nam in particular. Section 3 reviews the literature on \nthe effects of financial literacy. Data collection, the definition of the financial literacy score \nused  in  this  study,  and  some  descriptive  analyses  are  presented  in  Section  4. \nEconometric methodologies and results are reported in Section 5, followed by some \nconcluding remarks in Section 6.  \n \n1  While financial literacy, as explained above, is multi-dimensional, including financial knowledge, financial \nbehavior, and financial attitude, most of the literature has defined financial knowledge to be equivalent to \nfinancial literacy, ignoring the other dimensions. In this version of this paper, we adopt this more limited \ndefinition and use financial knowledge and financial literacy interchangeably.  \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \n2.  FINTECH AND FINTECH DEVELOPMENT IN THE \nASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS  \n2.1  An Overview of Fintech \n\u201cFintech\u201d refers to \u201cany technological innovation in\u2014and automation of\u2014the financial \nsector,  including  advances  in  financial  literacy,  advice  and  education,  as  well  as \nstreamlining of wealth management, lending and borrowing, retail banking, fundraising, \nmoney transfers/payments, investment management and more\u201d (Investopedia 2018). \nEarlier generations of finance-related technology typically focused on providing services \nto already-established financial firms, but today\u2019s fintech companies are increasingly \nproviding services directly to consumers. Fintech is changing finance in fundamental \nways,  from  investment  management  to  capital\u2013raising,  to  the  very  form  \nof currency itself. In each of these areas, fintech innovation has lowered the barriers  \nto  entry,  expanded  access  to  financial  services,  and  challenged  the  traditional \nunderstanding of how finance works. \nMajor categories of financial services offered by fintech firms include: \n\u2022  Payments and transfers (e-commerce payments; mobile banking; mobile wallets; \nperson-to-person  (P2P)  payments  and  transfers;  digital  currency;  \nand cross-border transactions including remittances and business-to-business \n(B2B) payments) \n\u2022  Personal  finance  (robo-advisors;  mobile  trading;  and  personal  financial \nmanagement) \n\u2022  Alternative financing (crowdfunding; alternative lending; and invoice and supply-\nchain finance); and  \n\u2022  Others (insurance products, etc.) \nTable 1 provides an overview of the size, composition, and regulatory status of fintech \nmarkets in some Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies. \nTable 1: Fintech in ASEAN: A Snapshot \nNo. of Fintech  Investment in 2017  Regulatory \n  Companies  (USD million)  Key Sectors  Sandbox \nIndonesia  262  26   Mobile payments, alternative  Yes \n(370% yoy growth)  lending \nMalaysia  196  75   Payments, consumer finance  Yes \n(1,500% yoy growth) \nPhilippines  115  78   Payments (incl. remittances)  Yes \n(1,300% yoy growth) \nSingapore  490  141   Wealth management,  Yes \n(68% yoy growth)  alternative lending, payments \nThailand  128  12   Payments  Yes \n(\u201340% yoy growth) \nViet Nam  153  3  Payments  No \nNote: yoy = year-on-year. \nSource: EY (2018). \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \n2.2  Fintech Development in Viet Nam \nDigital financial services are at a very nascent stage in Viet Nam. Mobile \u201ctop ups\u201d and \nbill payments for some services such as electricity and water through a formal bank \naccount, the internet, or cell phones are the most widely used services.  \nInternet Infrastructure in Viet Nam \nMobile connectivity has grown rapidly in Viet Nam since 2005. About 60\u201370% of the \npopulation have access to the internet either though computer or mobile phone. The \nmobile network has upgraded to 4G and 5G will be implemented from 2020 onward.  \nIn recent years, the environment in Viet Nam for internet startups, including fintech \nstartups,  has  eased.  Together  with  internet  startups,  the  number  of  fintech  firms \nincreased significantly from about 70 in 2016 to about 150 firms in 20192. However, the \nservices they provide are rather limited, mostly e-wallets and payment facilitators. Some \nfintech firms provide robo-advisor services for stock and forex trading.  \n3.  LITERATURE SURVEY \nIn the literature, there are several widely used definitions of financial literacy. In their \nreview article, Lusardi and Mitchell (2014) define financial literacy as \u201cpeoples\u2019 ability to \nprocess economic information and make informed decisions about financial planning, \nwealth accumulation, debt, and pensions.\u201d The Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development and the International Network on Financial Education (OECD/INFE \n2016) define financial literacy as \u201c[a] combination of awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude \nand behavior necessary to make sound financial decisions and ultimately achieve \nindividual  financial  wellbeing.\u201d  Thus,  this  concept  of  financial  literacy  is  \nmulti-dimensional, reflecting not only knowledge but also skills, attitudes, and actual \nbehavior. \nThe literature on financial literacy focuses on two main areas: (i) the determinants of \nfinancial literacy, including age, gender, level of education, and occupation; and (ii) the \neffects of financial knowledge on various aspects of financial behavior, including saving, \nuse of credit, preparation for retirement, and awareness and adoption of various financial \nservices. Here we focus on the latter area. \nThere is a well-developed literature trying to link measures of financial literacy with other \neconomic and financial behaviors, going back to Bernheim (1995, 1998) in the United \nStates, in response to the increasing shift toward defined-contribution pension plans. \nThis area of research received a further boost after the global financial crisis of 2008\u2013\n2009, which drew attention to numerous scams inflicted on individual borrowers and \ninvestors in the United States and other countries. Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly (2003) \nfound a strong correlation between financial literacy and daily financial management \nskills, while other studies found that people who were more numerate and financially \nliterate  are  more  likely  to  participate  in  financial  markets  and  invest  \nin stocks and make precautionary savings (Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula 2010; van \nRooij, Lusardi, and Alessie 2011; de Bassa Scheresberg 2013). People who are more \nfinancially savvy are also more likely to undertake retirement planning, and those who \nplan also accumulate more wealth (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011). These results have been \n \n2  Vietnam  News  \u201cFintech  firms  need  clear  policy  to  develop,\u201d  available  at  https://vietnamnews.vn/ \neconomy/524301/fintech-firms-need-clear-policy-to-develop.html \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \ncorroborated in a number of countries. The work of Mahdzan and Tabiani (2013) is an \nexample of this kind of research in Malaysia. \nOn the liability side of the household balance sheet, Moore (2003) found that the least \nfinancially literate are more likely to have more expensive mortgages. Campbell (2006) \nshowed that those with lower income and less education were less likely to refinance \ntheir mortgages during periods of falling interest rates. Stango and Zinman (2009) found \nthat those unable to correctly calculate interest rates generally borrowed more and \naccumulated less wealth. \nThe likelihood of participation in a risky financial behavior is crucially affected by the costs \nand benefits of acquiring information (Hsiao and Tsai 2018). Vissing-Jorgensen (2003) \nand Guiso and Jappelli (2005) suggest that awareness and understanding of financial \nproducts will influence one\u2019s decision on whether or not to use those products. Van Rooij \net al. (2011) show that financial literacy has a positive correlation with stock market \nparticipation.  Individuals  with  higher  financial  literacy  may  have  lower  fixed  costs \nassociated  with  acquiring  and  processing  financial  information  than  those  \nwith lower financial literacy, which would make it easier for the former to participate in \nrisky financial activities. Similar to stock market participation, adoption of fintech products \nalso bears risks. According to Morgan, Huang, and Trinh (2019), in addition to traditional \nfinancial risks, use of digital financial services entails a variety of new risks. Such risks \nare more diverse and harder to spot than those associated with traditional financial \nproducts and services. These risks include phishing, pharming, spyware, and swaps. \nFurthermore, digital footprints may also be a source of risks. This suggests that higher \nfinancial literacy could also facilitate the use of fintech products and services. \nAs far as we are aware, no one has examined the relation between financial literacy and \nthe  awareness  and  adoption  of  financial  technology.  We  conjecture  that  there  is  \na positive correlation between financial literacy and the awareness and adoption of \nfinancial technology. \n4.  FINANCIAL LITERACY AND FINTECH IN VIET NAM \n4.1  Measurement of Financial Knowledge \nWe adopt the questionnaire developed by OECD/INFE (2015a) to calculate scores for \nfinancial knowledge. The score for financial knowledge is calculated from seven survey \nquestions reflecting the subject\u2019s understanding of basic financial knowledge, such  \nas calculating interest rates, compound interest rates, risk and return evaluation, and \nunderstanding of inflation and risk diversification. The score ranges between 0 and 7. \nFor ease of interpretation, we calculate a z-score for financial knowledge.  \nWe also collect information on a large number of control variables that could also \ninfluence financial knowledge, including age, gender, education level, urban or rural, \noccupation, income, and debt.  \n4.2  Data Collection \nThe survey was conducted by Mekong Development Research Institute under the \ndirection of the Asian Development Bank Institute. Data collection was conducted from \nJune to August 2019. We use the sample from Viet Nam Housing Living Standard \nSurveys (VHLSS) 2018 as our base sample. Two big cities, Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh, \nwere selected purposely, while three other provinces located in the North (Bac Ninh), \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nCentral (Quang Nam), and South (Dong Thap) were randomly selected. Samples in Ha \nNoi and Ho Chi Minh City are taken to represent urban areas, and samples from the \nother provinces are taken as representative of rural areas. \nIn these cities/provinces, we randomly selected VHLSS enumeration areas (EAs). In \neach EA, we attempted to interview 30 households as in VHLSS 2018. If a household \nthat was in VHLSS 2018 was not available, we selected the household next to it to \nreplace the missing one. About 50% of households could not be traced and were \nreplaced by new households.  \nWe  interviewed  the  household  head  or  those  who  had  the  fullest  information  on  \nthe  household  finances  to  answer  general  demographic  and  household  economic \ninformation  (including  total  household  income,  household  debt,  and  assets).  We \nrandomly selected one household member who was at least 18 years old to answer our \nmain sections on fintech and financial literacy (using dice and household member lists). \nIn the case that the individual was not available at the interview time, we continued to \nrandomly select an individual until we found someone available.  \nOur final sample includes 1,058 households, of which 45% are located in rural areas and \n55% located in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City.  \n4.3  Stylized Facts of Financial Knowledge \nFigure 1 compares the average values of the scores for financial knowledge. On average \nthe financial knowledge score in our sample is 4.4, 0.4 percentage points higher than the \nresults in our earlier study (Morgan and Trinh 2019). This is partly due to the fact that \nhalf of our sample is in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, where the income and education \nlevels are on average higher than for individuals in other provinces (previous literature \nhas shown that income and education level are major determinants of financial literacy). \nIn comparison with other countries, the financial knowledge of the Vietnamese is much \nlower than in some other Asian economies including the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nthe Republic of Korea, but is not low when considered relative to per capita GDP. The \nfigure  shows  that  male  respondents  have higher  financial  knowledge  than  female \nrespondents, although the difference is not large. People with higher income also have \nhigher financial knowledge than people with lower income. It is interesting to note that \nwhile  many  other  studies  find  that  younger  people  tend  \nto have lower financial knowledge scores, in our sample we find that the financial \nknowledge score is higher among younger persons than older individuals, especially \nthose over age 60.  \n4.4  ICT Adoption and Financial Literacy  \nAlmost all respondents report using a telephone. Moreover, about 63.3% of them  \nused a smartphone (Figure 2). Men tend to use smartphones more than women (67.5% \nvs.  60.6%).  While  almost  all  young  people  (i.e.,  those  aged  less  than  30)  used  \na smartphone, only 62.9% of those aged from 30 to 60 and 40.3% of those aged  \nmore than 60 years used smartphones. The smartphone penetration rate also differs by \nhousehold  income  group.  While  nearly  82%  of  people  with  income  more  than \nVND190 million  use  smartphones,  the  figure  for  those  with  income  less  than \nVND85 million is only 40.32%.  \n   \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nFigure 1: Financial Literacy Score of Different Groups  \n \nNote: yo = years old, VND = Viet Nam dong. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \nFigure 2: Telephone Penetration Rate in Viet Nam (%) \n \nNote: yo = years old, VND = Viet Nam dong. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \nFigure 3 shows how holders of smartphones use them. Unsurprisingly, most smartphone \nusers (more than 90%) use their smartphones to make phone calls or messages (through \nmobile apps), take pictures, and read news, while about 80% use smartphones for \naccessing social media. About half of smartphone users use them for online shopping \nand social shopping (mostly through Facebook).

The \nproportion of those who are aware of digital borrowing is much higher than the proportion \nof  those  who  are  aware  of  other  products.  About  45.7%  of  respondents  \nare aware of digital borrowing while the figures for digital lending and digital money  \n(e-wallets) are 36.3% and 39.8%, respectively. Only 18.9% and 15.7% of respondents \nare aware of digital insurance and digital financial advisors, respectively. The data also \nindicates that for each type of digital finance men are more likely to be aware than \nwomen.  \n   \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nFigure 5: Awareness of Fintech Products, by Age Group  \n(% of Total Respondents)  \n \nNote: yo = years old. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \nFigure 6: Awareness of Fintech Products, by Income Group  \n(% of Total Respondents) \n \nNote: VND = Viet Nam dong. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \nSince most of the fintech services adopted are related to payments and transfers, Figure \n7 shows how respondents use methods of payment and fintech services to make their \npayments and transfers. Nearly all respondents (99.4%) still use cash for payment. Cash \nis also the major means of money transfer with 95.57% using cash for transfers. This \nsuggests that cash is still the dominant means of transactions. Around 13% and 10% of \nrespondents use credit/debit cards for payments and transfers, respectively. Only about \n10% of respondents use mobile phones for transfers and payments and only 5% use \ncomputers for transfers and payments.  \n   \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nFigure 7: Payment Method (% of Total Respondents) \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \nFigure 8: Adoption of Fintech Services, by Gender, Age, and Income  \n(% of Total Respondents) \n \nNote: yo = years old, VND = Viet Nam dong. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \nFigure 8 reports the adoption of fintech services by different groups of respondents. On \naverage, men tend to adopt fintech services more than women, but the difference is quite \nsmall. For example, 18% of male respondents use an e-banking service, while the figure \nfor  female  respondents  is  about  15%.  The  proportion  of  younger  people  \n(i.e., those aged less than 30 years old) using fintech services is much higher than that \namong older people, and the differences are rather large, especially between those aged \nless than 30 years old and those more than 60 years old. Less than 5% of those whose \nannual household income is less than VND85 million adopt at least one fintech service, \nwhile the figures for those with annual household income more than VND190 million are \nfrom 23% to nearly 36%, depending on the type of fintech service. The differences in \nfintech adoption rates between the top income group and the middle-income group are \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nalso large. Only around 10% of those in the middle-income groups use at least one \nfintech service.  \nFigure 9 shows the financial literacy scores of those who adopted fintech services and \nthose who did not. As expected, there is a positive relation between fintech adoption and \nfinancial literacy score. For example, individuals using e-banking services have an \naverage financial score of 5.1 while that of non e-banking users is only 4.3.  \nFigure 9: Fintech Adoption and Financial Literacy Scores  \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n5.

While \npossible reverse causality running from fintech adoption to financial literacy may not pose \na big threat to our estimation since fintech has only recently been developed in Viet Nam, \nvarious unobservable factors may be correlated with both fintech adoption and financial \nliteracy. To deal with this issue, the instrumental variable approach is appropriate. \nHowever, it is rather difficult to find suitable variables that are related to financial literacy \nbut exogenous to fintech adoption. Therefore, our estimates should be interpreted \ncautiously.  \n5.2  Empirical Results  \nTable 2 reports our estimation results on the relationship between financial literacy and \nthe awareness of five fintech products (digital borrowing, digital lending, digital money, \ndigital insurance, and digital financial advisor) and our fintech awareness index. The \nresult in Table 1 shows that financial literacy is positively associated with the likelihood \nof awareness of most fintech products. A one-standard deviation increase in the financial \nliteracy score is associated with an increase in the probability of awareness of digital \nborrowing by 5.2 percentage points; of digital lending by 3 percentage points; digital \npayment by 3.6 percentage points; and by digital insurance by 1.6 percentage points. A \none-standard deviation increase in financial literacy also increases our awareness index \nby 9 percentage points. However, financial literacy does not have a correlation with \nawareness of digital financial advisors. This result is consistent with previous results. \nMorgan and Trinh (2020) found that one-standard deviation increase in financial literacy \nraises the awareness of at least one fintech product by 8 percentage points in the Lao \nPDR.  \nThe result also suggests that those living in households with annual income higher  \nthan 190 million Vietnamese dong (VND) have a higher likelihood of being aware of \nfintech products (except for digital insurance) than those with income lower than VND85 \nmillion (the reference group), while there is no statistically significant difference in \nawareness of any fintech products between the reference group and those with incomes \nfrom VND85 million to VND190 million. This result suggests that only a proportion of \nhigh-income people are more likely to know about fintech products. Even when financial \nliteracy and income are controlled for, individuals with higher education levels have a \nsignificantly  higher  likelihood  of  awareness  of  fintech  products.  For  example,  an \nindividual with at least university degree education tends to have a higher probability of \nawareness of digital borrowing than those with only primary education by about 18 \npercentage points. The likelihood of awareness of some fintech services such as digital \nlending and digital financial advisors among those with secondary school education are \nno different from those with primary education. Especially for digital financial advisor, \nonly  those  with  at  least  college  education  have  higher  likelihood  \nof awareness than those in the reference group, while there is no difference in the \nawareness between those with secondary education and high school education and \nthose with primary education.  \nOur estimation results also show that, after controlling for education level and income \nlevel, the likelihood of awareness of some fintech products such as digital lending and \ndigital insurance is not statistically significantly related to age groups and gender. \nMeanwhile, for digital borrowing, people aged more than 60 are less likely to be aware \nthan those who are under 30, while there is no difference among those who are over 30 \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nand those who are under 30 years old. The results also show that individuals who are \nover 40 (over 30) are less likely to be aware of digital payments (digital financial advisor) \nthan people who are less than 30 years old. This may partly be due to higher exposure \nto new information for those who are under 30 than people in other age groups. Female \nand male individuals show no difference in awareness of fintech products, except for two \nproducts, digital payment and digital financial advisor.  \nTable 2: Effect of Financial Literacy on Awareness of Fintech Products \n(1)  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5)  (6) \nDigital  Digital \nBorrowin Digital  Digital  Insuranc Digital  Awareness \n  g  Lending  Payment  e  Advisor  Index \nFinancial knowledge  0.052***  0.030***  0.036***  0.016*  0.006  0.090*** \n  [0.011]  [0.011]  [0.009]  [0.008]  [0.007]  [0.020] \nAge: 30\u201339 yo  0.088  0.057  \u20130.054  \u20130.007  \u20130.106**  \u20130.014 \n  [0.054]  [0.055]  [0.046]  [0.045]  [0.043]  [0.095] \nAge: 40\u201349 yo  \u20130.015  0.033  \u20130.097**  0.038  \u20130.132***  \u20130.111 \n  [0.053]  [0.053]  [0.042]  [0.044]  [0.040]  [0.092] \nAge: 50\u201359 yo  \u20130.065  \u20130.049  \u20130.147***  \u20130.018  \u20130.140***  \u20130.270*** \n  [0.053]  [0.052]  [0.042]  [0.041]  [0.039]  [0.090] \nAge: Over 60 yo  \u20130.100*  \u20130.048  \u20130.124***  \u20130.003  \u20130.116***  \u20130.252*** \n  [0.052]  [0.051]  [0.042]  [0.043]  [0.042]  [0.095] \nMale  0.040  0.042  0.081***  0.041  0.115***  0.205*** \n  [0.030]  [0.030]  [0.025]  [0.025]  [0.023]  [0.056] \nIncome: VND85m\u2013190m  0.057  \u20130.024  \u20130.009  0.015  0.018  0.037 \n  [0.037]  [0.036]  [0.031]  [0.028]  [0.024]  [0.067] \nIncome: >VND190m   0.093**  0.075*  0.091**  0.038  0.080**  0.243*** \n  [0.043]  [0.043]  [0.036]  [0.035]  [0.031]  [0.079] \nIncome: Not reported  \u20130.063  \u20130.097  \u20130.054  \u20130.043  \u20130.032  \u20130.186 \n  [0.080]  [0.079]  [0.072]  [0.063]  [0.048]  [0.161] \nEducation: Up to secondary   0.081*  0.065  0.071**  0.055**  \u20130.008  0.170** \n  [0.043]  [0.044]  [0.031]  [0.027]  [0.019]  [0.072] \nEducation: Up to high school  0.149***  0.100**  0.163***  0.067*  0.027  0.325*** \n  [0.049]  [0.049]  [0.038]  [0.034]  [0.025]  [0.083] \nEducation: Higher education  0.226***  0.180***  0.370***  0.183***  0.196***  0.744*** \n  [0.061]  [0.062]  [0.052]  [0.051]  [0.045]  [0.116] \nEducation: College and higher  0.176***  0.139**  0.493***  0.148***  0.229***  0.763*** \n[0.059]  [0.060]  [0.047]  [0.048]  [0.043]  [0.107] \nProvincial dummies  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes \nIntercept  0.160**  0.199**  0.237***  0.056  0.130**  \u20130.500*** \n   [0.079]  [0.079]  [0.064]  [0.064]  [0.054]  [0.141] \nR-sq  0.137  0.071  0.370  0.089  0.183  0.284 \nN  1,058  1,058  1,058  1,058  1,058  1,058 \nNote: Figures in bracket are standard errors. ***, **, and * denote coefficient is statistically significant at the 1%, 5%, and \n10% levels, respectively.  \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n   \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nWe also explore whether financial literacy is correlated with adoption of fintech services \nor not. Adoption of fintech products could be observed for those who had access  \nto the internet. Using the OLS estimation method may give a biased estimation due  \nto  the  sample  selection  issue.  Therefore,  we  estimate  this  relationship  using  the \nHeckman two-step procedure.4 Table 3 presents our estimation results. Columns 1\u20133 \nare three dummy variables which indicate the adoption of three services: e-banking \nservices, e-payment, and e-transfer. Column 4 is the first stage estimation results from \nestimating the probability of access to the internet.5 From the first stage, the inversed \nMill\u2019s ratio is calculated and is added as an additional control variable in the second \nstage. Our estimation results show the estimates of inversed Mills\u2019 ratio variables are \nstatistically significant in all three 2nd stage equations, implying that control for sample \nbias is important to have better estimates of the relationship between financial literacy \nand fintech adoption.  \nOur estimation results show that financial literacy is positively correlated with adoption \nof some fintech products. For example, a one-standard deviation increase in the financial \nliteracy raises the likelihood of using e-banking services by 4.1 percentage points and \nthe likelihood of using e-payment services by 3.9 percentage points. However, financial \nliteracy is not correlated with using e-transfer services.  \nWith regards to other control variables, our results suggest that those with higher income \ntend  to  use  fintech  services  more  than  those  with  lower  income.  However,  the \nrelationship is only statistically significant for those living in households with annual \nincome higher than VND190 million, i.e., their likelihood of using fintech services is \nstatistically significantly higher than that of those from households with annual income \nless than VND85 million. People with higher education are also more likely to use fintech \nservices than those having lower education. For example, individuals with at least \nuniversity degree education have higher likelihood of using e-banking than those with \nprimary education by 80%. The figures for those with higher education, high school \neducation, and secondary education are 64.1, 39.7, and 22 percentage points. We also \nobserved the same pattern for other fintech products. \nWhile age does not affect the awareness of fintech products, it is correlated with the use \nof fintech services. Generally, the likelihood of using fintech products among younger \npeople  is  higher  than  that  among  older  people.  For  example,  people  over  \n60 years old have lower likelihood of using e-banking than those under 30 years old  \nby 65.5 percentage points. The figures for people from 50 to 59 years old and from  \n40 to 49 years old are 51.6 and 22.4 percentage points. There are some differences \namong those from 30 years old to 40 years old and those under 30 years old, but these \ndifferences are small and only statistically significant at the 10% level. Our results also \nsuggest that men are more likely to use fintech services (e-banking and e-payment) than \nwomen.  \n   \n \n4  Please refer to Appendix 1 for the OLS estimation results.  \n5  It would be ideal to have exogenous variables which are correlated with access to the internet but  \nnot related to the decision to adopt fintech products.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \nThis study is one of the first to examine the relationship between financial literacy and \nawareness and adoption of fintech products and services in the context of developing \ncountries. We use our newly collected data on financial literacy and fintech adoption in \nViet Nam. We examine whether higher financial literacy could improve the awareness of \nfive fintech products (digital borrowing, digital lending, digital payment, digital insurance, \nand digital financial advisor) and raise the level of our own awareness index. We also \nexamine the correlation between financial literacy and the adoption of fintech services \n(e-banking, e-payment, and e-transfer).  \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nOur empirical results show that financial literacy is correlated with the awareness of \nalmost all fintech products (except for digital financial advisors) and of our awareness \nindex.  It  also  correlates  with  the  adoption  of  two  fintech services  (e-banking and  \ne-payment). Our results also show a positive relationship among income, education \nlevel, and fintech awareness and fintech adoption. While age does not affect awareness \nof some fintech products, it has a negative correlation with fintech adoption. Older people \nhave lower likelihood of using fintech products. We also find that people living in Ha Noi \nand Ho Chi Minh City are more likely to be aware and adopt fintech services than people \nliving in other provinces.  \nNot only does the low level of financial literacy explain the low level of awareness and \nadoption of fintech products; it is also related to the underdeveloped state of ICT \ninfrastructure in the country. Therefore, in addition to general and financial education \nprograms, the country needs to put more effort into the development of ICT infrastructure \nas a necessary condition for fintech development. \n   \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1154  Morgan and Trinh \n \nREFERENCES \nde Bassa Scheresberg, C. 2013. \u201cFinancial Literacy and Financial Behavior among \nYoung Adults: Evidence and Implications.\u201d Numeracy 6 (2). \nBernheim, B. 1995. \u201cDo Households Appreciate Their Financial Vulnerabilities?  \nAn Analysis of Actions, Perceptions, and Public Policy.\u201d In Tax Policy and \nEconomic Growth, 1\u201330.

A growing literature has examined the role of financial literacy in an individual\u2019s income, saving behavior, and the use of various financial products. However, so far, we are not aware of any studies of the relationship between financial literacy and the awareness and adoption of financial technology (fintech) products, i.e., financial products provided via internet-based and mobile-based platforms especially in developing countries. We examine this relationship in a developing country, Viet Nam. To do so, we conducted a survey on financial literacy and fintech awareness and adoption, using financial literacy questions to calculate a financial literacy score. We find that a higher level of financial literacy has strong and positive effects on an individual\u2019s awareness and use of fintech products.", "Title": "Fintech and Financial Literacy in Viet Nam"}}
