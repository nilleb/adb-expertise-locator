INTRODUCTION \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\nFinancial  literacy  has  gained  an  important  position  in  the  policy  agenda  of  many \ncountries,  and  the  importance  of  collecting  informative,  reliable  data  on  the  levels  of \nfinancial literacy across the adult population has been widely recognized (OECD/INFE \n2015b).  This  parallels  the  emphasis  placed  on  increasing  financial  inclusion,  i.e.,  the \naccess of individuals and firms to financial products and services. If individuals do not \nunderstand financial principles, they will not be able to profit from such increased access. \nAlso, the trend of switching to defined-contribution plans from defined-benefit pension \nplans  implies  that  individuals  will  increasingly  need  to  manage  their  own  retirement \nsavings and pensions. At their summit in Los Cabos, Mexico in 2012, Group of Twenty \n(G20) \nthe  High-Level  Principles  on  National  Strategies  \nfor  Financial  Education  developed  by  the  OECD/INFE,  thereby  acknowledging  the \nimportance of coordinated policy approaches to financial education (G20 2012). At the \nsame time, surveys consistently show that the level of financial literacy is relatively low, \neven in advanced economies (OECD/INFE 2016, 2017, 2018). This indicates that the \nneed for higher levels of financial literacy is increasing. \n\nleaders  endorsed \n\nRapid developments in financial technology (fintech) also highlight the need to improve \nfinancial  literacy  in  order  to  use  innovative  financial  products  and  services.  With  the \ndevelopment  of  information\u2013communication  technology  (ICT),  there  is  a  growing  \nbreed  of  fintech  companies  that  provide  services  through  internet-  and  mobile-based \nplatforms such as Ant Financial (People\u2019s Republic of China), Grab (Singapore), Paytm \n(India),  Compass  (US),  and  Opendoor  (UK).  Recent  literature  has  shown  that  fintech \n(especially  mobile  money)  has  helped  to  increase  financial  inclusion  in  developing \neconomies  where  the  traditional  bank-based  financial  system  is  underdeveloped \n(Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018). Other studies have identified factors that affect the adoption \nof mobile- and internet-based financial services (Jack, Ray, and Suri 2013; Suri 2017). \nHowever, we are not aware of any papers that investigate the role of financial literacy on \nthe awareness and/or use of fintech products.  \n\nThis paper attempts to fill this gap by using newly collected data in a developing country, \nViet Nam. Our research question is whether those with a higher level of financial literacy \nare more likely to be aware of and use fintech products. To answer this question, we \nconstruct a financial literacy1 score based on the approach of the OECD/INFE (2015a, \n2015c)  and  use  both ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  and  Heckman  two-step  procedure \nestimation. We find that higher financial literacy is significantly related to both awareness \nand  adoption  of  fintech  products.  Therefore,  improvements  in  financial  literacy  could \nspeed  the  adoption  of  fintech  products  and  services,  and  thereby  promote  financial \ninclusion. \n\nThe  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  provides  some  background  on  fintech \ndevelopment in general, and in Viet Nam in particular. Section 3 reviews the literature on \nthe effects of financial literacy. Data collection, the definition of the financial literacy score \nused  in  this  study,  and  some  descriptive  analyses  are  presented  in  Section  4. \nEconometric  methodologies  and  results  are  reported  in  Section  5,  followed  by  some \nconcluding remarks in Section 6.  \n\n \n\n1   While financial literacy, as explained above, is multi-dimensional, including financial knowledge, financial \nbehavior, and financial attitude, most of the literature has defined financial knowledge to be equivalent to \nfinancial literacy, ignoring the other dimensions. In this version of this paper, we adopt this more limited \ndefinition and use financial knowledge and financial literacy interchangeably.  \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\n2.  FINTECH AND FINTECH DEVELOPMENT IN THE \n\nASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS  \n\n2.1  An Overview of Fintech \n\n\u201cFintech\u201d  refers  to  \u201cany  technological  innovation  in\u2014and  automation  of\u2014the  financial \nsector,  including  advances  in  financial  literacy,  advice  and  education,  as  well  as \nstreamlining of wealth management, lending and borrowing, retail banking, fundraising, \nmoney  transfers/payments,  investment  management  and  more\u201d  (Investopedia  2018). \nEarlier generations of finance-related technology typically focused on providing services \nto  already-established  financial  firms,  but  today\u2019s  fintech  companies  are  increasingly \nproviding  services  directly  to  consumers.  Fintech  is  changing  finance  in  fundamental \nways, \nform  \nof  currency  itself.  In  each  of  these  areas,  fintech  innovation  has  lowered  the  barriers  \nto  entry,  expanded  access  to  financial  services,  and  challenged  the  traditional \nunderstanding of how finance works. \n\ninvestment  management \n\nto  capital\u2013raising, \n\nthe  very \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\nMajor categories of financial services offered by fintech firms include: \n\n\u2022  Payments and transfers (e-commerce payments; mobile banking; mobile wallets; \nperson-to-person \ncurrency;  \nand  cross-border  transactions  including  remittances  and  business-to-business \n(B2B) payments) \n\n(P2P)  payments  and \n\ntransfers;  digital \n\n\u2022  Personal \n\nfinance  (robo-advisors;  mobile \n\ntrading;  and  personal \n\nfinancial \n\nmanagement) \n\n\u2022  Alternative financing (crowdfunding; alternative lending; and invoice and supply-\n\nchain finance); and  \n\n\u2022  Others (insurance products, etc.) \n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the size, composition, and regulatory status of fintech \nmarkets in some Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies. \n\nTable 1: Fintech in ASEAN: A Snapshot \n\nInvestment in 2017 \n(USD million) \n\n26  \n(370% yoy growth) \n75  \n(1,500% yoy growth) \n78  \n(1,300% yoy growth) \n141  \n(68% yoy growth) \n12  \n(\u201340% yoy growth) \n3 \n\nKey Sectors \n\nMobile payments, alternative \nlending \nPayments, consumer finance \n\nPayments (incl. remittances) \n\nWealth management, \nalternative lending, payments \nPayments \n\nPayments \n\nRegulatory \nSandbox \nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo. of Fintech \nCompanies \n262 \n\n \nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \n\nSingapore \n\nThailand \n\nViet Nam \n\n196 \n\n115 \n\n490 \n\n128 \n\n153 \n\nNote: yoy = year-on-year. \n\nSource: EY (2018). \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\n2.2  Fintech Development in Viet Nam \n\nDigital financial services are at a very nascent stage in Viet Nam. Mobile \u201ctop ups\u201d and \nbill  payments  for  some  services  such  as  electricity  and  water  through  a  formal  bank \naccount, the internet, or cell phones are the most widely used services.  \n\nInternet Infrastructure in Viet Nam \n\nMobile  connectivity  has  grown  rapidly  in  Viet  Nam  since  2005.  About  60\u201370%  of  the \npopulation  have  access  to  the  internet  either  though  computer  or  mobile  phone.  The \nmobile network has upgraded to 4G and 5G will be implemented from 2020 onward.  \n\nIn  recent  years,  the  environment  in  Viet  Nam  for  internet  startups,  including  fintech \nstartups,  has  eased.  Together  with  internet  startups,  the  number  of  fintech  firms \nincreased significantly from about 70 in 2016 to about 150 firms in 20192. However, the \nservices they provide are rather limited, mostly e-wallets and payment facilitators. Some \nfintech firms provide robo-advisor services for stock and forex trading.  \n\n3.  LITERATURE SURVEY \n\nIn  the  literature,  there  are  several  widely  used  definitions  of  financial  literacy.  In  their \nreview article, Lusardi and Mitchell (2014) define financial literacy as \u201cpeoples\u2019 ability to \nprocess  economic  information  and  make  informed  decisions  about  financial  planning, \nwealth accumulation, debt, and pensions.\u201d The Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand  Development  and  the  International  Network  on  Financial  Education  (OECD/INFE \n2016) define financial literacy as \u201c[a] combination of awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude \nand  behavior  necessary  to  make  sound  financial  decisions  and  ultimately  achieve \nis  \nindividual \nmulti-dimensional,  reflecting  not  only  knowledge  but  also  skills,  attitudes,  and  actual \nbehavior. \n\nfinancial  wellbeing.\u201d  Thus, \n\nthis  concept  of \n\nfinancial \n\nliteracy \n\nThe  literature  on  financial  literacy  focuses  on  two  main  areas:  (i)  the  determinants  of \nfinancial literacy, including age, gender, level of education, and occupation; and (ii) the \neffects of financial knowledge on various aspects of financial behavior, including saving, \nuse of credit, preparation for retirement, and awareness and adoption of various financial \nservices. Here we focus on the latter area. \n\nThere is a well-developed literature trying to link measures of financial literacy with other \neconomic and financial behaviors, going back to Bernheim (1995, 1998) in the United \nStates,  in  response  to  the  increasing  shift  toward  defined-contribution  pension  plans. \nThis area of research received a further boost after the global financial crisis of 2008\u2013\n2009,  which  drew  attention  to  numerous  scams  inflicted  on  individual  borrowers  and \ninvestors in the United States and other countries. Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly (2003) \nfound  a  strong  correlation  between  financial  literacy  and  daily  financial  management \nskills,  while  other  studies  found  that  people  who  were  more  numerate  and  financially \nliterate  are  more \ninvest  \nin  stocks and  make  precautionary  savings  (Christelis,  Jappelli,  and  Padula  2010; van \nRooij, Lusardi, and Alessie 2011; de Bassa Scheresberg 2013). People who are more \nfinancially savvy are also more likely to undertake retirement planning, and those who \nplan also accumulate more wealth (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011). These results have been \n\nfinancial  markets  and \n\nto  participate \n\nlikely \n\nin \n\n2   Vietnam  News  \u201cFintech  firms  need  clear  policy  to  develop,\u201d  available  at  https://vietnamnews.vn/ \n\neconomy/524301/fintech-firms-need-clear-policy-to-develop.html \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\ncorroborated in a number of countries. The work of Mahdzan and Tabiani (2013) is an \nexample of this kind of research in Malaysia. \n\nOn the liability side of the household balance sheet, Moore (2003) found that the least \nfinancially literate are more likely to have more expensive mortgages. Campbell (2006) \nshowed that those with lower income and less education were less likely to refinance \ntheir mortgages during periods of falling interest rates. Stango and Zinman (2009) found \nthat  those  unable  to  correctly  calculate  interest  rates  generally  borrowed  more  and \naccumulated less wealth. \n\nThe likelihood of participation in a risky financial behavior is crucially affected by the costs \nand benefits of acquiring information (Hsiao and Tsai 2018). Vissing-Jorgensen (2003) \nand Guiso and Jappelli (2005) suggest that awareness and understanding of financial \nproducts will influence one\u2019s decision on whether or not to use those products. Van Rooij \net  al.  (2011)  show  that  financial  literacy  has  a  positive  correlation  with  stock  market \nparticipation.  Individuals  with  higher  financial  literacy  may  have  lower  fixed  costs \nthose  \nassociated  with  acquiring  and  processing \nwith lower financial literacy, which would make it easier for the former to participate in \nrisky financial activities. Similar to stock market participation, adoption of fintech products \nalso bears risks. According to Morgan, Huang, and Trinh (2019), in addition to traditional \nfinancial risks, use of digital financial services entails a variety of new risks. Such risks \nare  more  diverse  and  harder  to  spot  than  those  associated  with  traditional  financial \nproducts  and  services.  These  risks  include  phishing,  pharming,  spyware,  and  swaps. \nFurthermore, digital footprints may also be a source of risks. This suggests that higher \nfinancial literacy could also facilitate the use of fintech products and services. \n\ninformation \n\nfinancial \n\nthan \n\nAs far as we are aware, no one has examined the relation between financial literacy and \nthe  awareness  and  adoption  of  financial  technology.  We  conjecture  that  there  is  \na  positive  correlation  between  financial  literacy  and  the  awareness  and  adoption  of \nfinancial technology. \n\n4.  FINANCIAL LITERACY AND FINTECH IN VIET NAM \n\n4.1  Measurement of Financial Knowledge \n\nWe adopt the questionnaire developed by OECD/INFE (2015a) to calculate scores for \nfinancial knowledge. The score for financial knowledge is calculated from seven survey \nquestions  reflecting  the  subject\u2019s  understanding  of  basic  financial  knowledge,  such  \nas  calculating  interest  rates,  compound  interest  rates,  risk  and  return  evaluation,  and \nunderstanding of inflation and risk diversification. The score ranges between 0 and 7. \nFor ease of interpretation, we calculate a z-score for financial knowledge.  \n\nWe  also  collect  information  on  a  large  number  of  control  variables  that  could  also \ninfluence  financial  knowledge,  including  age,  gender,  education  level,  urban  or  rural, \noccupation, income, and debt.  \n\n4.2  Data Collection \n\nThe  survey  was  conducted  by  Mekong  Development  Research  Institute  under  the \ndirection of the Asian Development Bank Institute. Data collection was conducted from \nJune  to  August  2019.  We  use  the  sample  from  Viet  Nam  Housing  Living  Standard \nSurveys (VHLSS) 2018 as our base sample. Two big cities, Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh, \nwere selected purposely, while three other provinces located in the North (Bac Ninh), \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\nCentral (Quang Nam), and South (Dong Thap) were randomly selected. Samples in Ha \nNoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City are  taken  to  represent  urban  areas,  and samples  from  the \nother provinces are taken as representative of rural areas. \n\nIn  these  cities/provinces,  we  randomly  selected  VHLSS  enumeration  areas  (EAs).  In \neach EA, we attempted to interview 30 households as in VHLSS 2018. If a household \nthat  was  in  VHLSS  2018  was  not  available,  we  selected  the  household  next  to  it  to \nreplace  the  missing  one.  About  50%  of  households  could  not  be  traced  and  were \nreplaced by new households.  \n\nWe  interviewed  the  household  head  or  those  who  had  the  fullest  information  on  \nthe  household  finances  to  answer  general  demographic  and  household  economic \ninformation  (including  total  household  income,  household  debt,  and  assets).  We \nrandomly selected one household member who was at least 18 years old to answer our \nmain sections on fintech and financial literacy (using dice and household member lists). \nIn the case that the individual was not available at the interview time, we continued to \nrandomly select an individual until we found someone available.  \n\nOur final sample includes 1,058 households, of which 45% are located in rural areas and \n55% located in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City.  \n\n4.3  Stylized Facts of Financial Knowledge \n\nFigure 1 compares the average values of the scores for financial knowledge. On average \nthe financial knowledge score in our sample is 4.4, 0.4 percentage points higher than the \nresults in our earlier study (Morgan and Trinh 2019). This is partly due to the fact that \nhalf of our sample is in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, where the income and education \nlevels are on average higher than for individuals in other provinces (previous literature \nhas shown that income and education level are major determinants of financial literacy). \nIn comparison with other countries, the financial knowledge of the Vietnamese is much \nlower than in some other Asian economies including the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nthe Republic of Korea, but is not low when considered relative to per capita GDP. The \nfigure  shows  that  male  respondents  have  higher  financial  knowledge  than  female \nrespondents, although the difference is not large. People with higher income also have \nhigher financial knowledge than people with lower income. It is interesting to note that \nwhile \ntend  \nfind \nto  have  lower  financial  knowledge  scores,  in  our  sample  we  find  that  the  financial \nknowledge  score  is  higher  among  younger  persons  than  older  individuals,  especially \nthose over age 60.  \n\nyounger \n\nstudies \n\npeople \n\nmany \n\nother \n\nthat \n\n4.4  ICT Adoption and Financial Literacy  \n\nAlmost  all  respondents  report  using  a  telephone.  Moreover,  about  63.3%  of  them  \nused a smartphone (Figure 2). Men tend to use smartphones more than women (67.5% \nvs.  60.6%).  While  almost  all  young  people  (i.e.,  those  aged  less  than  30)  used  \na  smartphone,  only  62.9%  of  those  aged  from  30  to  60  and  40.3%  of  those  aged  \nmore than 60 years used smartphones. The smartphone penetration rate also differs by \nhousehold  income  group.  While  nearly  82%  of  people  with  income  more  than \nVND190 million  use  smartphones,  the  figure  for  those  with  income  less  than \nVND85 million is only 40.32%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\nFigure 1: Financial Literacy Score of Different Groups  \n\nNote: yo = years old, VND = Viet Nam dong. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nFigure 2: Telephone Penetration Rate in Viet Nam (%) \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: yo = years old, VND = Viet Nam dong. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nFigure 3 shows how holders of smartphones use them.

Nearly all respondents (99.4%) still use cash for payment. Cash \nis also the major means of money transfer with 95.57% using cash for transfers. This \nsuggests that cash is still the dominant means of transactions. Around 13% and 10% of \nrespondents use credit/debit cards for payments and transfers, respectively.

For  each  type  of  fintech  service,  \nthe  dependent  variable  takes  the  value  of  one  if  individual \n is  aware  of  its \nexistence, and zero otherwise. Second, we construct an index of awareness from \nthe information relating to the individual\u2019s awareness of each fintech service. The \nindex ranges from zero to five, i.e., one for each fintech service that individual \n \nis  aware  of.

We \nused  the  group  of  young  people  as  the base  group.  For  educational  level,  we \ncombined the categories into five groups: (i) those with some, completed, primary \neducation  (called  the  \u201cPrimary  education\u201d  group);  (ii)  those  with  some,  or \ncompleted, secondary education (called the \u201cUp to secondary education\u201d group); \n(iii)  those  with  some  or  complete  high  school  (called  the  \u201cUp  to  high  school \neducation\u201d  group);  (iv)  those  with  some  technical  school  or  3-year  college \ngraduation (called \u201cHigher education\u201d group); and (v) those with at least university \ndegree \ngraduate  \nand  higher\u201d  group).  We  use  the  first  group  (\u201cPrimary  education\u201d  group)  as  the \nreference group. We separate household income into four groups: those living in \nhouseholds  with  income  less  than  VND85  million  per  year  (i.e.,  equal  \nto  about  75% of  total  median  income);  those  living  in households  with  income \nfrom  VND85  million  to  VND190  million;  those  with  income  of  more  than \nVND190 million (i.e., about 150% of total median income); and those who did not \nreport their income.

The  three  fintech  services  that  are \navailable are (i) e-banking services; (ii) e-payment services; and (iii) e-transfer services. \nIt should be noted that these three services are not exclusively excluded. One can use \ne-banking  apps  for  e-payment  or  e-transfer.

While \npossible reverse causality running from fintech adoption to financial literacy may not pose \na big threat to our estimation since fintech has only recently been developed in Viet Nam, \nvarious unobservable factors may be correlated with both fintech adoption and financial \nliteracy.  To  deal  with  this  issue,  the  instrumental  variable  approach  is  appropriate. \nHowever, it is rather difficult to find suitable variables that are related to financial literacy \nbut  exogenous  to  fintech  adoption.  Therefore,  our  estimates  should  be  interpreted \ncautiously.  \n\n5.2  Empirical Results  \n\nTable 2 reports our estimation results on the relationship between financial literacy and \nthe awareness of five fintech products (digital borrowing, digital lending, digital money, \ndigital  insurance,  and  digital  financial  advisor)  and  our  fintech  awareness  index.  The \nresult in Table 1 shows that financial literacy is positively associated with the likelihood \nof awareness of most fintech products. A one-standard deviation increase in the financial \nliteracy  score  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  the probability  of  awareness  of  digital \nborrowing  by  5.2  percentage  points;  of  digital  lending  by  3  percentage  points;  digital \npayment by 3.6 percentage points; and by digital insurance by 1.6 percentage points. A \none-standard deviation increase in financial literacy also increases our awareness index \nby  9  percentage  points.  However,  financial  literacy  does  not  have  a  correlation  with \nawareness  of  digital  financial  advisors.  This  result  is  consistent  with  previous  results. \nMorgan and Trinh (2020) found that one-standard deviation increase in financial literacy \nraises the awareness of at least one fintech product by 8 percentage points in the Lao \nPDR.  \n\nThe  result  also  suggests  that  those  living  in  households  with  annual  income  higher  \nthan  190  million  Vietnamese  dong  (VND)  have  a  higher  likelihood  of  being  aware  of \nfintech products (except for digital insurance) than those with income lower than VND85 \nmillion  (the  reference  group),  while  there  is  no  statistically  significant  difference  in \nawareness of any fintech products between the reference group and those with incomes \nfrom  VND85  million  to  VND190  million.  This  result  suggests  that  only  a  proportion  of \nhigh-income people are more likely to know about fintech products. Even when financial \nliteracy  and  income are controlled  for,  individuals  with  higher  education  levels have a \nsignificantly  higher  likelihood  of  awareness  of  fintech  products.  For  example,  an \nindividual with at least university degree education tends to have a higher probability of \nawareness  of  digital  borrowing  than  those  with  only  primary  education  by  about  18 \npercentage points. The likelihood of awareness of some fintech services such as digital \nlending and digital financial advisors among those with secondary school education are \nno  different  from  those  with  primary  education.  Especially  for  digital  financial  advisor, \nonly \nlikelihood  \nof  awareness  than  those  in  the  reference  group,  while  there  is  no  difference  in  the \nawareness  between  those  with  secondary  education  and  high  school  education  and \nthose with primary education.  \n\nthose  with \n\neducation \n\ncollege \n\nhigher \n\nhave \n\nleast \n\nat \n\nOur estimation results also show that, after controlling for education level and income \nlevel, the likelihood of awareness of some fintech products such as digital lending and \ndigital  insurance  is  not  statistically  significantly  related  to  age  groups  and  gender. \nMeanwhile, for digital borrowing, people aged more than 60 are less likely to be aware \nthan those who are under 30, while there is no difference among those who are over 30 \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\nand those who are under 30 years old. The results also show that individuals who are \nover 40 (over 30) are less likely to be aware of digital payments (digital financial advisor) \nthan people who are less than 30 years old. This may partly be due to higher exposure \nto new information for those who are under 30 than people in other age groups. Female \nand male individuals show no difference in awareness of fintech products, except for two \nproducts, digital payment and digital financial advisor.  \n\nTable 2: Effect of Financial Literacy on Awareness of Fintech Products \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n(6) \n\nDigital \nBorrowin\ng \n\n0.052*** \n\nDigital \nLending \n\n0.030*** \n\nDigital \nPayment \n\n0.036*** \n\n[0.009] \n\n\u20130.054 \n\n[0.046] \n\n\u20130.097** \n\n[0.042] \n\n\u20130.147*** \n\n[0.042] \n\n\u20130.124*** \n\n[0.042] \n\n0.081*** \n\n[0.025] \n\n\u20130.009 \n\n[0.031] \n\n0.091** \n\n[0.036] \n\n\u20130.054 \n\n[0.072] \n\n0.071** \n\n[0.031] \n\n0.163*** \n\n[0.038] \n\nDigital \nInsuranc\ne \n\n0.016* \n\n[0.008] \n\n\u20130.007 \n\n[0.045] \n\n0.038 \n\n[0.044] \n\n\u20130.018 \n\n[0.041] \n\n\u20130.003 \n\n[0.043] \n\n0.041 \n\n[0.025] \n\n0.015 \n\n[0.028] \n\n0.038 \n\n[0.035] \n\n\u20130.043 \n\n[0.063] \n\n0.055** \n\n[0.027] \n\n0.067* \n\n[0.034] \n\nDigital \nAdvisor \n\n0.006 \n\n[0.007] \n\n\u20130.106** \n\n[0.043] \n\n\u20130.132*** \n\n[0.040] \n\nAwareness \nIndex \n\n0.090*** \n\n[0.020] \n\n\u20130.014 \n\n[0.095] \n\n\u20130.111 \n\n[0.092] \n\n\u20130.140*** \n\n\u20130.270*** \n\n[0.039] \n\n[0.090] \n\n\u20130.116*** \n\n\u20130.252*** \n\n[0.042] \n\n[0.095] \n\n0.115*** \n\n0.205*** \n\n[0.023] \n\n0.018 \n\n[0.024] \n\n0.080** \n\n[0.031] \n\n\u20130.032 \n\n[0.048] \n\n\u20130.008 \n\n[0.019] \n\n0.027 \n\n[0.025] \n\n[0.056] \n\n0.037 \n\n[0.067] \n\n0.243*** \n\n[0.079] \n\n\u20130.186 \n\n[0.161] \n\n0.170** \n\n[0.072] \n\n0.325*** \n\n[0.083] \n\n[0.052] \n\n[0.051] \n\n[0.045] \n\n[0.116] \n\n0.493*** \n\n0.148*** \n\n0.229*** \n\n0.763*** \n\n[0.047] \n\n[0.048] \n\n[0.043] \n\nYes \n\n0.237*** \n\n[0.064] \n\n0.370 \n\n1,058 \n\nYes \n\n0.056 \n\n[0.064] \n\n0.089 \n\n1,058 \n\nYes \n\n0.130** \n\n[0.054] \n\n0.183 \n\n1,058 \n\n[0.107] \n\nYes \n\n\u20130.500*** \n\n[0.141] \n\n0.284 \n\n1,058 \n\n[0.011] \n\n0.057 \n\n[0.055] \n\n0.033 \n\n[0.053] \n\n\u20130.049 \n\n[0.052] \n\n\u20130.048 \n\n[0.051] \n\n0.042 \n\n[0.030] \n\n\u20130.024 \n\n[0.036] \n\n0.075* \n\n[0.043] \n\n\u20130.097 \n\n[0.079] \n\n0.065 \n\n[0.044] \n\n0.100** \n\n[0.049] \n\n[0.062] \n\n0.139** \n\n[0.060] \n\nYes \n\n0.199** \n\n[0.079] \n\n0.071 \n\n1,058 \n\n0.226*** \n\n0.180*** \n\n0.370*** \n\n0.183*** \n\n0.196*** \n\n0.744*** \n\n \n\nFinancial knowledge \n\n \nAge: 30\u201339 yo \n\n \nAge: 40\u201349 yo \n\n \nAge: 50\u201359 yo \n\n \nAge: Over 60 yo \n\n \nMale \n\n \nIncome: VND85m\u2013190m \n\n \nIncome: >VND190m  \n\n \nIncome: Not reported \n\n \nEducation: Up to secondary  \n\n \nEducation: Up to high school \n\n \nEducation: Higher education \n\n \nEducation: College and higher \n\nProvincial dummies \n\nIntercept \n\n  \n\nN \n\nR-sq \n\n[0.011] \n\n0.088 \n\n[0.054] \n\n\u20130.015 \n\n[0.053] \n\n\u20130.065 \n\n[0.053] \n\n\u20130.100* \n\n[0.052] \n\n0.040 \n\n[0.030] \n\n0.057 \n\n[0.037] \n\n0.093** \n\n[0.043] \n\n\u20130.063 \n\n[0.080] \n\n0.081* \n\n[0.043] \n\n0.149*** \n\n[0.049] \n\n[0.061] \n\n0.176*** \n\n[0.059] \n\nYes \n\n0.160** \n\n[0.079] \n\n0.137 \n\n1,058 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: Figures in bracket are standard errors. ***, **, and * denote coefficient is statistically significant at the 1%, 5%, and \n10% levels, respectively.  \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\nWe also explore whether financial literacy is correlated with adoption of fintech services \nor  not.  Adoption  of  fintech  products  could  be  observed  for  those  who  had  access  \nto  the  internet.  Using  the  OLS  estimation  method  may  give  a  biased  estimation  due  \nto  the  sample  selection  issue.  Therefore,  we  estimate  this  relationship  using  the \nHeckman  two-step  procedure.4 Table  3  presents  our  estimation  results.  Columns  1\u20133 \nare  three  dummy  variables  which  indicate  the  adoption  of  three  services:  e-banking \nservices, e-payment, and e-transfer. Column 4 is the first stage estimation results from \nestimating the probability of access to the internet.5 From the first stage, the inversed \nMill\u2019s  ratio  is  calculated  and  is  added  as  an  additional  control  variable  in  the  second \nstage. Our  estimation  results  show  the  estimates of  inversed  Mills\u2019  ratio variables  are \nstatistically significant in all three 2nd stage equations, implying that control for sample \nbias is important to have better estimates of the relationship between financial literacy \nand fintech adoption.  \n\nOur estimation results show that financial literacy is positively correlated with adoption \nof some fintech products. For example, a one-standard deviation increase in the financial \nliteracy raises the likelihood of using e-banking services by 4.1 percentage points and \nthe likelihood of using e-payment services by 3.9 percentage points. However, financial \nliteracy is not correlated with using e-transfer services.  \n\nWith regards to other control variables, our results suggest that those with higher income \ntend  to  use  fintech  services  more  than  those  with  lower  income.  However,  the \nrelationship  is  only  statistically  significant  for  those  living  in  households  with  annual \nincome  higher  than  VND190  million,  i.e.,  their  likelihood  of  using  fintech  services  is \nstatistically significantly higher than that of those from households with annual income \nless than VND85 million. People with higher education are also more likely to use fintech \nservices  than  those  having  lower  education.  For  example,  individuals  with  at  least \nuniversity degree education have higher likelihood of using e-banking than those with \nprimary  education  by  80%.  The  figures  for  those  with  higher  education,  high  school \neducation, and secondary education are 64.1, 39.7, and 22 percentage points. We also \nobserved the same pattern for other fintech products. \n\nthan \n\nis  higher \n\nWhile age does not affect the awareness of fintech products, it is correlated with the use \nof fintech services. Generally, the likelihood of using fintech products among younger \npeople \nthat  among  older  people.  For  example,  people  over  \n60  years  old  have  lower  likelihood  of  using  e-banking  than  those  under  30  years  old  \nby  65.5  percentage  points.  The  figures  for  people  from  50  to  59  years  old  and  from  \n40  to  49  years  old  are  51.6  and  22.4  percentage  points.  There  are some  differences \namong those from 30 years old to 40 years old and those under 30 years old, but these \ndifferences are small and only statistically significant at the 10% level. Our results also \nsuggest that men are more likely to use fintech services (e-banking and e-payment) than \nwomen.  \n\n \n\n4   Please refer to Appendix 1 for the OLS estimation results.  \n5   It  would  be  ideal  to  have  exogenous  variables  which  are  correlated  with  access  to  the  internet  but  \nnot  related  to  the  decision  to  adopt  fintech  products.  There  are  several  for  this  including  internet \ndevelopment, and telecom development at the provincial level.  \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\nTable 3: Effects of Financial Knowledge on Fintech Adoption:  \nHeckman Two-step Procedure \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n \n\nFinancial knowledge \n \n\nAge: 30\u201339 yo \n \n\nAge: 40\u201349 yo \n \n\nAge: 50\u201359 yo \n \n\nAge: Over 60 yo \n \n\nMale \n \n\nIncome: VND85m\u2013190m \n \n\nIncome: > VND190m \n \n\nIncome: Not reported \n \n\nEducation: Up to secondary education \n \n\nEducation: Up to high school \n \n\nEducation: Higher education \n \n\nEducation: College & higher \n \n\nProvince dummies \nIntercept \n  \n\nMills \n\\lambda \n  \n\nN \n\ne-Banking \n0.041** \n[0.016] \n\u20130.108* \n[0.056] \n\u20130.224*** \n[0.059] \n\u20130.516*** \n[0.082] \n\u20130.655*** \n[0.087] \n0.089** \n[0.038] \n0.077 \n[0.054] \n0.289*** \n[0.060] \n\u20130.163 \n[0.116] \n0.220** \n[0.088] \n0.397*** \n[0.107] \n0.641*** \n[0.122] \n0.807*** \n[0.126] \nYes \n\u20130.476*** \n[0.173] \n \n\ne-Payment \n0.039** \n[0.015] \n\u20130.101* \n[0.054] \n\u20130.208*** \n[0.057] \n\u20130.459*** \n[0.079] \n\u20130.606*** \n[0.084] \n0.069* \n[0.036] \n0.077 \n[0.053] \n0.225*** \n[0.058] \n0.027 \n[0.112] \n0.182** \n[0.085] \n0.376*** \n[0.103] \n0.570*** \n[0.118] \n0.666*** \n[0.122] \nYes \n\u20130.445*** \n[0.167] \n \n\ne-Transfer \n0.000 \n[0.013] \n0.034 \n[0.043] \n0.021 \n[0.046] \n\u20130.140** \n[0.067] \n\u20130.228*** \n[0.071] \n\u20130.006 \n[0.030] \n0.051 \n[0.045] \n0.165*** \n[0.050] \n\u20130.059 \n[0.096] \n0.124 \n[0.079] \n0.247*** \n[0.092] \n0.385*** \n[0.104] \n0.458*** \n[0.107] \nYes \n\u20130.186 \n[0.145] \n \n\n0.480*** \n[0.108] \n\n631 \n\n0.463*** \n[0.105] \n\n631 \n\n0.180* \n[0.095] \n\n631 \n\nFirst Stage \n0.151*** \n[0.041] \n\u20130.182 \n[0.222] \n\u20130.794*** \n[0.206] \n\u20131.528*** \n[0.205] \n\u20131.811*** \n[0.211] \n0.518*** \n[0.172] \n0.379*** \n[0.123] \n0.598*** \n[0.148] \n\u20130.193 \n[0.286] \n1.152*** \n[0.183] \n1.810*** \n[0.239] \n2.075*** \n[0.252] \n0.314*** \n[0.107] \nYes \n\u20130.536* \n[0.313] \n \n \n \n\n1,058 \n\n6.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nThis study is one of the first to examine the relationship between financial literacy and \nawareness and adoption of fintech products and services in the context of developing \ncountries. We use our newly collected data on financial literacy and fintech adoption in \nViet Nam. We examine whether higher financial literacy could improve the awareness of \nfive fintech products (digital borrowing, digital lending, digital payment, digital insurance, \nand digital financial advisor) and raise the level of our own awareness index. We also \nexamine the correlation between financial literacy and the adoption of fintech services \n(e-banking, e-payment, and e-transfer).  \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\nOur  empirical  results  show  that  financial  literacy  is  correlated  with  the  awareness  of \nalmost all fintech products (except for digital financial advisors) and of our awareness \nindex.  It  also  correlates  with  the  adoption  of  two  fintech  services  (e-banking  and  \ne-payment).  Our  results  also  show  a  positive  relationship  among  income,  education \nlevel, and fintech awareness and fintech adoption. While age does not affect awareness \nof some fintech products, it has a negative correlation with fintech adoption. Older people \nhave lower likelihood of using fintech products. We also find that people living in Ha Noi \nand Ho Chi Minh City are more likely to be aware and adopt fintech services than people \nliving in other provinces.  \n\nNot only does the low level of financial literacy explain the low level of awareness and \nadoption  of  fintech  products;  it  is  also  related  to  the  underdeveloped  state  of  ICT \ninfrastructure  in  the  country.  Therefore,  in  addition  to  general  and  financial  education \nprograms, the country needs to put more effort into the development of ICT infrastructure \nas a necessary condition for fintech development. \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1154 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nMorgan and Trinh \n\nde Bassa Scheresberg, C. 2013. \u201cFinancial Literacy and Financial Behavior among \n\nYoung Adults: Evidence and Implications.\u201d Numeracy 6 (2). \n\nBernheim, B. 1995. \u201cDo Households Appreciate Their Financial Vulnerabilities?  \nAn Analysis of Actions, Perceptions, and Public Policy.\u201d In Tax Policy and \nEconomic Growth, 1\u201330.

A \ngrowing literature has examined the role of financial literacy in an individual\u2019s income, saving \nbehavior, and the use of various financial products. However, so far, we are not aware of any \nstudies  of  the  relationship  between  financial  literacy  and  the  awareness  and  adoption  \nof financial technology (fintech) products, i.e., financial products provided via internet-based \nand  mobile-based  platforms  especially  in  developing  countries.  This  paper  examines  this \nrelationship in a developing country, Viet Nam. To do so, we conducted a survey on financial \nliteracy and fintech awareness and adoption, using financial literacy questions to calculate a \nfinancial literacy score. We find that a higher level of financial literacy has strong and positive \neffects on an individual\u2019s awareness and use of fintech products.  \n \nKeywords:  financial  literacy,  financial  behavior,  fintech,  awareness  of  fintech,  household \nsaving, Viet Nam \n \nJEL Classification: D14, G11, J26 \n \n", " \n"]}
