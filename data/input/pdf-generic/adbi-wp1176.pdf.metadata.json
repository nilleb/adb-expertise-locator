The issues with these subsidies are \nfully acknowledged by many energy economists; however, the total subsidy level remains high. \nThis is because energy subsidies are often closely related to the political economy viewpoint. \nMoreover,  the  rationale  underlying  fossil  fuel  subsidies,  particularly  concerning  political, \neconomic, and social contexts, is to reduce energy poverty, ensure access to energy, and \nredistribute the wealth that stems from the exploitation of national resources.

INTRODUCTION \nEnergy subsidies are widely used (Commader 2012). The scarcity of energy resources \nhas been fully reflected in the implementation of government policy changes in domestic \nenergy prices (Hope and Singh 1995). This issue has proved controversial in several \ndeveloping countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Middle Eastern and \nNorth African countries. However, while there seems to be general agreement about the \ncosts of subsidizing energy, there are differing views concerning the economic and \nwelfare consequences that result from a change in relative fuel prices. This issue is \nparticularly important in the current economic climate in which world growth has been \nweaker and slower than expected. For example, weak Chinese data continue to cause \nconcern, and growth in Japan and the eurozone remains fragile at best (Deloitte 2019). \nThe  prime  objective  of this  policy  is  to  protect the  lowest-income  households  and \nfoster domestic  industrial  growth.  However, in  most cases,  a  government\u2019s  energy  \nbill is enormous and deleterious; it strains a country\u2019s fiscal revenues, misallocates  \nthe distribution of income, and perpetuates damaging a large proportion of economic \nactivity.  Energy  subsidies  are  a  costly  way  of  benefitting  the  poor,  but  from  the \ngovernments\u2019  perspective,  this  assistance  should  be  minimal.  However,  there  has  \nbeen much controversy about this unfavorable economic policy. The many contentious \ndebates  about  both  public  agencies\u2019  budget  balances  and fairness  are  insufficient  \nto  enable  these  agents  to  implement  this  reform  appropriately  (Inchauste  and \nVictor 2017). \nThese energy subsidization issues are widely acknowledged; however, the total subsidy \nlevel remains high. For instance, consumer subsidies accounted for 0.7% of the global \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 (Coady et al. 2015). This is because energy \nsubsidies are often closely related to the political economy.  \nThe  experience  of  this  reform  depends  on  many  factors,  such  as  the  timing, \ncommunication strategy, and mitigating measurements. Many countries have begun to \nundergo major energy reforms to ensure that their governments\u2019 fiscal budgets are \nsustainable and accountable. Also, research of fuel subsidy reform in the context of  \nthe political social economy is imperative in the current oil-exporting countries. This \nstudy, therefore, aims to explore the political economy of energy reform in selected  \nAsia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies.1 The APEC countries selected \nfor this study are Brunei Darussalam, Chile, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nIndonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian \nFederation, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \nOne of the motivations for analyzing the APEC economies is that this region has the \nhighest world energy demand and includes four out of the world\u2019s five largest energy \nusers (the PRC, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States). Additionally, this \nregion contains some of the fastest-growing economies in the world as well as the major \nenergy producers and consumers.  \nOur research aims to investigate the factors that can affect subsidy policy decision-\nmaking in the APEC region. In this paper, we focus on examining the factors that are \nmost likely to have an impact on the removal of subsidy policies and determining why \nagents find it difficult to eliminate a policy once it is in place. \nVan Beers and Strand (2013) stated that a nation with strong economic growth and high \nachievement of the GDP per capita can generate higher oil prices. In most cases, these \n \n1  APEC comprises 21 members.  \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1176  Foo, Lean, and Salim \n \nhigher-income countries will tend to have higher fuel prices. Thus, the rate of subsidies \nimposed by these governments is relatively low but taxes are considered relatively high. \nThis is because the cost of oil prices in these countries includes refining, transportation, \nand distribution costs. The variation in these costs will certainly affect the overall retail \noil prices in these countries. \nThis study is particularly relevant concerning the last two years because of the sharp \ndecline in world oil prices. The low oil prices have created an opportunity for policymakers \nto implement such reform to enhance governments\u2019 fiscal position (Inchauste and Victor \n2017). Reform is urgently needed to prevent countries\u2019 economies from further distorting \nthe local energy prices and government expenditures. Besides, this paper aims to revisit \nthe political-economic doctrine of this region. It also provides a comprehensive policy \nimplication  to  help  these  governments  achieve  their  commitment  to  phasing  out \ninefficient fossil fuel subsidies.  \nAnother major contribution that this paper makes is adopting an empirical approach to \ninvestigate the political factors that can exert an impact on fuel subsidy policies, which \nmany previous studies have found difficult to support (Anderson 1995; Alderman 2002; \nSovacool 2017). Also, the variables applied in this study contain some hidden factors \nconcerning the fuel prices that several APEC governments are tentatively subsidizing. \nTherefore,  applying  institutional  capacities,  such  as  control  of  corruption,  GDP, \ngovernment effectiveness, and political stability, can explain governments\u2019 decisions to \nremove fuel subsidy policies when applying domestic oil prices. This approach has also \nbeen used in other literature to address the elements absent from fuel subsidy policies \n(Joseph 2010; Kotsogiannis and Rizzo 2016). \nNumerous energy policy studies have asserted that governments should implement \nsubsidies only when they are essential, for example in the case of research support for \nnew technologies; the remainder should be dismantled (International Energy Agency \n2008; Victor 2009). Following this initiative, the research goal of this study is to focus in-\ndepth on a political perspective and provide policymakers with a rich source of political-\neconomic background about the economic situation that enables the policy reform to be \nimplemented effectively and efficiently. \nIncorporating such political factors in the fossil fuel subsidization reform is highly complex \nand problematic. Many policy makers find it extremely difficult to remove an energy \nsubsidy policy. This paper, therefore, aims to revisit the issue of political factors in energy \nreform; helping political leaders or interest groups resolve policy failure is as important \nas their decision to eliminate an energy subsidy.  \nThis study proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the current development in fossil \nfuel subsidy reforms in selected APEC economies. A discussion on the data sources and \nmethodology used in this study is provided in Section 3. Section 4 presents an analysis \nof the empirical results. Conclusions and policy implications are presented in Section 5. \n2.  OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDY \nREFORM AND THE POLITICAL ECONOMY \nPERSPECTIVE IN APEC ECONOMIES \nAPEC is a regional economic forum that was established in 1989. The objective of APEC \nis to support and sustain the economic growth of Asia and the Pacific economies. This \nforum has 21 member countries and is a key player in the world economic and energy \nlandscape. Accounting for about 60% of the world\u2019s energy demand in 2014, the APEC \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1176  Foo, Lean, and Salim \n \nregion includes four of the world\u2019s five largest energy users: the PRC, the United States, \nthe Russian Federation, and Japan. The APEC member countries are also the world\u2019s \nlargest energy producers and consumers (APEC 2017).

It is estimated that \nthe energy consumption in this region accounted for around 40% of the worldwide total \nbetween 2000 and 2014, due to the rapid economic growth and increasing population \nassociated with rising per capita income (International Energy Agency 2017). Energy \npolicy  development,  including  that  related  to  fossil  fuel  subsidies,  has  become  a \ncontentious issue in shaping the global energy trends.  \nSince 2014, the leaders of the APEC economies have renewed their commitment by \nconsidering the urgent need to implement subsidy reform. Several APEC countries have \npersistently attempted to abolish this policy gradually. The Philippines was the first nation \nin this economy to complete its oil subsidy policy removal, followed by a wave of reforms \nin other member countries, such as the PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mexico, resulting \nin rapid oil price declines. The calls for fossil fuel subsidy reform include the need for \nmore transparency on fossil fuel subsidies (Gerasimchuk et al. 2017). Figure 1 shows \nthe recent development of fuel subsidy reforms in the APEC economies, the process of \nwhich began since post the Asian currency crisis.  \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1176  Foo, Lean, and Salim \n \nFigure 1: Fuel Subsidy Reform in Selected APEC Member Nations \n \nSource: International Energy Agency (2017). \nEnergy subsidies are one of the most pervasive and controversial fiscal policy tools  \n(El-Katiri  and  Fattouh  2015).  These  policies  are  widely  perceived  as  providing \nmajor economic and social benefits for a country. Subsidies for energy consumption, \nwhich  economists  have  widely  discussed,  are still  a  debatable topic  regarding  the \neffectiveness and fairness of this policy. Agents implementing the policy encounter \nconsiderable  pressure  on  government  finances  and  the  undermining  of  fiscal \nsustainability (Inchauste and Victor 2017). However, discussion about this policy reform \noccurs  for  many  reasons:  for  example,  regarding  strengthening  the  economy  by \nincreasing sectoral  industrial  growth  as  well  as  alleviating  unemployment  to  avoid \ndissatisfaction among the general public (van Beers and Strand 2013). \nSeveral studies have discussed fossil subsidy reform from various standpoints (Kojima \n2012; Vagliasindi 2012a,b; Cottarelli et al. 2013; International Energy Agency 2014). A \nrecent study by Vigliasindi (2012a) demonstrated that fuel subsidy rates are being \nreduced in some countries as a result of policy reform initiated by their governments. \nHowever, the pace of the overall restructuring of this policy is slow. This is because these \nsubsidy reforms are extremely difficult to implement and put in place. The existence of \nfossil fuel subsidies raises a range of important economic and political issues that \nurgently need to be addressed. This study, therefore, aims to discuss how the overall \neffect of fuel subsidies influences economic performance. The impact on growth and \ndevelopment through energy subsidy reforms and the reasons why most governments \nstill subsidize energy are important issues that need to be included and conveyed in this \nstudy. \nWhy is energy reform such a long and difficult task for policymakers? Inchauste and \nVictor (2017) believe that reformers, such as policymakers, take on a challenging task \nwhen altering energy subsidies because, once implemented, these subsidies tend to \npersist. They specify that three basic logics drive reform, which is important for reformers \nwhen altering an energy subsidy policy. The first is the nation\u2019s fiscal burden. The \ngovernment, particularly once elected, manages subsidy costs as the main priority. This \nis because their constituents evaluate the government by considering, for the most part, \nthe government\u2019s performance; these restructured bills can be very costly and not viable \nfor a country\u2019s economic growth or its budget. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1176  Foo, Lean, and Salim \n \nThe second is the burden imposed on influential interest groups and stakeholders. These \npolicies create a significant benefit for well-organized interest groups (such as the bulk \ndistribution companies in Ghana). Additionally, they develop visible costs for organizing \ninterest groups with special privileges to easily access liberating public funds using \nunconventional policy through the restructuring of the policy (Inchauste and Victor 2017). \nThe third is that the policies deliver an inefficient benefit to the poor. The study by Coady \net al. (2015) showed that energy subsidies need to target low-income groups better; they \nare inefficient in benefiting the poor in many ways. Therefore, some countries with \nsubstantial energy subsidy costs have shifted to a more energy-efficient approach by \nimproving how these subsidies are allocated. \nCommander  (2012)  stated  that  various  factors  are  important  in  explaining  the \ngovernment\u2019s institutional capacity for using energy subsidies in the APEC region. These \ninclude  income  buffering  to  prevent  price  volatility  during  a  price  shock,  lobbying \nparticular vested interest groups and allowing national patrimony to allocate government \nrevenue  flow  from  natural  resources  more  unevenly  among  the  population,  and \ncomponents of industrial policies aimed at supporting production. They also include \nreinforcing external competitiveness by supporting the export orientation of the economy \nand diversifying the energy supply by reducing the dependence on fossil fuel imports \nthrough subsidies. \nFuel subsidies are usually imposed when a government sets the petrol price below the \nmarket or international price. Several research papers have revealed that this behavior \ncan induce overuse of energy in a country and undermine its overall output (Cornillie and \nFankhauser 2004; Hang and Tu 2007). More generally, governments decide to resort to \nenergy subsidies because they lack other effective avenues and the institutional capacity \nassociated with the implementation of the policy. For example, many developing nations \nhave limited their bureaucratic capacity and ability to monitor the policy, resulting in a \nrelatively small proportion of fiscal revenues being raised from income and profit taxes.  \nA government\u2019s institutional capacity appears to be incorporated into the type of political \nsystem in a country.2 The institutional quality and the political regime are interrelated. \nThese factors are usually used to determine the competitiveness or democracy of a \nregime by implementing a better institutional policy. Indeed, governments with weak \ninstitutions, e.g., a large number of developing countries that lack a workable mechanism \nfor  dialogue  and  resolution,  particularly  non-democratic  regimes,  have  tended  to \nintroduce or extend universal energy subsidies, sometimes irrespective of fiscal and \nother consequences. In general, policy decision-making appears to be problematic for \ngovernments when implementing energy reforms (Commander 2012). \nThere are both theoretical and practical reasons why autocracies experience difficulties \nin implementing reforms; energy reforms can be challenging and complex. As well as \nbeing extremely complex and involving many country-specific factors, some general \nfeatures of these reforms stand out. These include loss of economic rents by the affected \nparties, such as companies, individuals, or households, as well as a political dimension. \nPoliticians may be particularly affected by this reform simply because it may impact a \nrecipient\u2019s ability to fund political parties, which, in turn, provides these autocracies with \npreferential treatment (Acemoglu and Robinson 2001). While energy reforms certainly \ninvolve considerable complexity, an appropriate focus for better policy institutions, such \nas  effective  communication,  revenue  redistribution  measures,  and  further \n \n2  The institutional factors include bureaucratic quality, corruption, a lack of the rule of law, and democratic \naccountability. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1176  Foo, Lean, and Salim \n \ncomplementary policies, is key in removing the constraints that affect how the key \nplayers interact and the associated outcomes. \n3.  DATA SOURCES AND EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY \nVarious sources have been used to obtain the data in this study. Parameters such as \nbureaucratic quality, corruption, and democratic accountability were obtained from the \nInternational Country Risk Guide issued by the Political Risk Services group. Specific \ngovernment sources in the APEC region and various websites were used to provide the \ncountry-specific panel data sets. The sample period for the panel data sets was from \n1991 to 2018. Other than the International Country Risk Guide indicators, the World Bank \nand the International Monetary Fund were used to obtain economic indicators, such as \nthe GDP, for each member country. \nThe analysis in this study was applied to selected APEC economies that have imposed \nfuel subsidies. These APEC member countries are Brunei Darussalam, Chile, the PRC, \nIndonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian \nFederation, Thailand, and Viet Nam. These APEC nations are those that have subsidized \nat least one fuel product and have made progress in restructuring this policy in the last \n20 years. \nFollowing van Beers and Strand (2013) and Kolerus and Touna-Mama (2016), we \ndeveloped  the  analytical  framework  for  this  study.  We  aimed  to  investigate  how \ngovernment institutions influence the fuel price-setting process or subsidies across the \nAPEC economies. Accordingly, variables such as domestic fuel price, world oil price, \ngovernance (institutional and political variables, including government effectiveness, \naccountability, political stability, corruption, law and order, and regulatory quality), and \nrespective countries\u2019 GDP figures were incorporated in the model.

This framework offers a strong and good \nstarting point for political-economic analysis. We adopted a model using selected APEC \neconomies to use in this research. We then investigated the proportion of energy subsidy \n \n3  The macro policy control reflects an exogenous fiscal policy stance and the proxy for monetary policy. \n4  In measuring fuel prices, Koplow (2009) stated that the price gap approach is appealing. This approach \ncan deal with many complexities of energy policy interventions. This is because energy prices are a \nprimary driver of economic behavior and changes in consumer prices. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1176  Foo, Lean, and Salim \n \nthat will be affected by these two parties as a result of the structural reforms of this policy. \nWe  have come  to  believe that  this  can contribute some  beneficial values to  help \npolicymakers understand the benefits and costs across many diverse stakeholders; this \nis often essential for successful subsidy reform.5 \nAs mentioned previously, the APEC economies are some of the most significant energy \nproducers  and  consumers. Also,  in  recent years,  there  have been  many signs  of \nprogress  about  energy  subsidy  reforms  in  these  economies,  but  a  lot  of  work  is  \nstill required in this area. The elimination of fuel subsidies can lead to strong protest from \nthe  general  public  and  the  opposition  parties.  The  reason  is  that  it  can  affect \ndisadvantaged income citizens when they receive their energy bills. Therefore, our paper \naims to bridge the gap by focusing on policy-driven issues regarding subsidies and \nilluminating how the policy process can be influenced by political leaders in the country. \nWe ran regressions of the domestic retail price on the world fuel price, which are \nindicators of governance and fiscal and monetary policy variables. We then estimated \nEquation (1) with time and country fixed effects and robust standard errors clustered \non the country level. The specification in Equation (1) includes an interaction term \nbetween the world price and each governance variable. These two variables (the world \noil price and the individual governance variable) were used to test the relationship \nbetween these two parameters under different world price pressures. Equation (1) was \nalso used to estimate a dummy for oil exporters incorporated into each governance \nvariable, which could be used to test for the role of oil exporters.  \nIn calibrating the data set, we first used ordinary least squares (OLS) to analyze the data, \nfollowed by country fixed-effect (FE) regression. The fuel product used in this study was \nthe local gasoline with a retail price in US dollars. The data covered a broad range of \nAPEC countries and included the Asian financial crisis, the oil price spike in 2008, and \nthe subsequent decline during the global financial crisis. The purpose of including these \nperiods was to allow for the isolation of the effect of governance on local retail fuel prices \nand  thus  on  subsidization  policies.  Additionally,  these  periods  involved  substantial \nvariation across Asia and the Pacific region over time. For instance, this substantial \nchange included the upsurge of reforms as the world oil price spiked at the beginning of \nthe millennium, with a severe shortfall of government revenues. Many APEC economies, \nincluding the PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mexico, had already started to reconsider \neliminating energy subsidies on many fuel products, e.g., gasoline, diesel, and liquefied \npetroleum gas.  \n4.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nTable 2 explains the outcome concerning the extent to which governance and consumer \ngroups can affect fuel prices as a result of the decision to remove a fuel subsidization \npolicy.

They  show  that  fluctuations  in  the  domestic  retail  price  are \nsignificantly correlated with the world oil price, good governance, political stability, control \nof corruption, and law and order. By contrast, a nation\u2019s income, such as GDP, external \ndebt, government effectiveness, and regulatory quality are negatively correlated with the \nlocal  domestic  fuel  price.  This  finding  confirms  that  when  the  world  oil  price  is \nplummeting, the decision to remove a fuel subsidization policy impacts the national \nincome. \nOur study shows that countries adopting good government institutions and transparent \npublic policies tend to have higher domestic retail fuel prices. It shows that variables such \nas corruption control, government accountability, the rule of law, and world oil prices play \na critical role in determining decisions regarding fuel subsidization policies and domestic \nretail  prices.  These  four  variables  show  p-value  significance  levels,  \nand the results indicate that the transparency of institutional policies and governance can \naffect  domestic  fuel  prices.  In  fact,  due  to  the  robustness  of  these  variables  in  \nthe  model,  we  can  state  that  these  factors  can  influence  the  decisions  made  by \ngovernment agencies before deciding to abolish a fossil fuel subsidization policy. \n \n   \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1176  Foo, Lean, and Salim \n \nThe empirical outcomes in this study also show their consistency with the current trend \nof the economic climate in which crude oil prices have now plummeted to USD23 per \nbarrel. This is worth noting to explain a nation\u2019s external debt, GDP, and political stability, \neven though the outcomes show insignificance. The outcomes are appealing because \nour findings reveal that oil-exporting countries are facing challenging times. The majority \nof these countries are heavily dependent on their oil revenues, which have declined \nsubstantially. Indeed, lower pricing can lead to higher counterparty credit risk.  \nThe governments that have decided to phase out subsidy policies will experience an \nextremely tough time economically, politically, and socially during any unprecedented \nperiods (as with the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant global economic shutdown). Our \nstudy concludes that governments should review their subsidy policy at this critical time \nand ensure that this policy is applied by enhancing its specific objective of protecting \nvulnerable citizens. To a lesser extent, governments should be able to implement policies \nthat are effective and cheaper for both the general public and several interest groups. \nFuel subsidization is the key policy implemented by government agencies to assist \nvulnerable groups. However, the reform of this policy remains politically controversial. \nLockwood (2015) and Rentschler and Bazilian (2017) stated that reforms to remove \nsubsidies for petrol and diesel are, to a certain extent, almost universally politically \ncontroversial, particularly in emerging economies such as Indonesia and Malaysia.6 Fuel \nsubsidy reform can be politically difficult. A reform undertaken without proper planning \nby government agencies can lead to violent street protests, either immediately or at a \nlater date. To reiterate, this issue is a key objective for discussion in this study. \nNevertheless, political-economic challenges can create the most severe obstacles to \ntransforming both producer and consumer fuel subsidies. Overall experience suggests \nthat successful subsidy reforms in the past have been implemented under both high and \nlow fuel prices. However, this implies that the current lower oil prices are conducive to, \nbut not essential for, reform (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). The outcome of this study \nsuggests that institutional and governance factors are common political determinants for \nluring voters or influential interest groups, rather than being sound economic welfare \nfactors for governments to assist the poor income groups. \nVariables such as governance (Gov ) and GDP are found to be negatively associated \nit\nwith fuel subsidies, but the parameter of corruption control can be positively correlated \nwith fuel price.7 Based  on the  data  presented  in  Table  2,  we  can  argue  that the \nelimination of the fuel subsidization policy in APEC countries is solely dependent on the \ninstitutional capacity of the government. A rational, sound and effective institutional \ngovernment policy can help determine what contributes to the public acceptance of \nreforms (e.g., advance publicity can be useful in preventing some interest groups from \nhiding  their  self-interested  purpose,  arguing  that  the  reform  creates  hardship  or \nuncertainty for a wider community). Similarly to the study by Alderman (2002), we argue \nthat this is one of the useful strategies that need to be addressed in APEC countries. To \nvarying  degrees,  the  strategy  has  been  implemented  successfully  in  Bangladesh, \nPakistan, and Zimbabwe (Alderman 2002). \n   \n \n6  The fuel subsidy reform was implemented under the Barisan Nasional government in 2013. However, the \nnewly elected Pakatan Harapan government intends to reintroduce this policy as one of its agenda items \nin its election campaign.  \n7  Kotsogiannis and Rizzo (2016) stated that in a country with a relatively low level of corruption, the level \nof fuel subsidies can be reduced substantially because the corruption control has increased. \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1176  Foo, Lean, and Salim \n \nThe findings of this study indicate that political perceptions about fuel subsidization \npolicies can be complicated. The policies involve many economic, political, and social \ncontexts. The contentious issues of political barriers in the APEC countries\u2019 fuel subsidy \npolicies will continue; the journey towards the implementation of this reform cannot be \nstraightforward. Time is needed to remove these barriers and prevent rent-seeking \nbehavior  by  entrenched  interest  groups  that  only  benefit  from  government  fuel \nsubsidization.  \n5.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nThis study addressed the contentious debate on the political issues that influence energy \nsubsidy reform in selected APEC countries. It also incorporated some factors that can \nexert an impact on the decision to remove the fuel subsidy policy using the oil price. We \nused a panel data set from 1991 to 2018 in selected APEC economies to conduct both \nOLS  and  FE  regression  analyses.  Regardless  of  the  differences in the  degree  of \ndemocracy, the different levels of economic growth, the status as an importing or an \nexporting  net  oil  country,  or  the  differences  in  energy  consumption  among  these \ncountries, energy subsidy reforms and political perspectives are critical issues that affect \nthe APEC economies.  \nThe findings of this study are consistent with previous literature. They show that changes \nin domestic fuel prices can have a significant impact on a nation\u2019s income level and its \ninstitutional policy capacity. The empirical outcome of this research strongly supports the \nassertion that strong and effective governance, such as the ability to control corruption, \ngovernment  effectiveness,  political  stability,  regulatory  quality,  law  and  order,  and \ntransparency, is the key point that determines the accomplishment of fuel subsidization \npolicies. Nonetheless, this study bears some similarity to other previous research that \nindicates that a sound governance institutional policy is a key factor in oil and gas subsidy \nreform involving groups with different income levels.  \nThis  research  is  particularly  important  for  APEC  member  countries  that  wish  to \nimplement a sound, effective, and convincing policy for their population that removes the \nfuel  subsidy  policy  and  benefits the  population  directly.  However, the  rationality  of \npoliticians convincing a community of the benefit of this policy remains doubtful, and it \ndepends on the trust between politicians and the people. In this case, democracy plays \na critical role and is the best strategy for eliminating a fuel subsidy policy. \nDomestic energy pricing is inevitably political in many APEC countries and remains an \nimportant agenda for many governments. An example of this is the inability of the \nMalaysian Alliance  of  Hope  (Pakatan  Harapan)  government  to  implement  a  better \nplan for fuel pricing reform. In large, emerging economies, such as the PRC and the \nRussian Federation, routes to reform are likely to be continued. The energy pricing \nreforms  involve transforming  political  rents  into  forms  that  are  more functional  for \nchanging the whole nature of emerging market economies. For energy policy reformers, \na deep understanding of the nature of political rent and the strategy for managing it in \nthese large, emerging economies are two of the challenging requirements for discovering \nthose routes.  \nMany of our conclusions are novel, but much research needs to be conducted in the \nfuture, perhaps applying more sophisticated research techniques and/ updated data in \nthis area. Our conclusions suggest that energy social welfare can be allocated equally \nand fairly through sound policy advice that has been discussed earlier in Section 2. Even \nthough the data set we apply in this paper is readily available, our data still have \nlimitations. One of these is that our gasoline data use US dollars.

The issues with these subsidies are fully acknowledged by many energy economists; however, the total subsidy level remains high. This is because energy subsidies are often closely related to the political economy viewpoint. Moreover, the rationale underlying fossil fuel subsidies, particularly concerning political, economic, and social contexts, is to reduce energy poverty, ensure access to energy, and redistribute the wealth that stems from the exploitation of national resources. Although there is considerable controversy surrounding the efficiency of these policies, energy subsidies confer private benefits on particular interest groups and, once implemented, tend to persist. We discuss and model various aspects of the political economy of fuel subsidy reform in selected Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. Applying a panel data set from the period 1991\u20132018, we provide an empirical analysis of the economic and political perspectives of fuel prices in APEC countries resulting from the elimination of fossil fuel subsidization policies. Our findings robustly support the current economic trend of those governments that have decided to phase out fossil fuel energy policies.
