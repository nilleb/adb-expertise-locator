INTRODUCTION \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nEnergy subsidies are widely used (Commader 2012). The scarcity of energy resources \nhas been fully reflected in the implementation of government policy changes in domestic \nenergy  prices  (Hope  and Singh  1995).  This  issue  has  proved controversial  in several \ndeveloping countries, such  as Indonesia, Malaysia,  Thailand,  and Middle Eastern  and \nNorth African countries. However, while there seems to be general agreement about the \ncosts  of  subsidizing  energy,  there  are  differing  views  concerning  the  economic  and \nwelfare  consequences  that  result  from  a  change  in  relative  fuel  prices.  This  issue  is \nparticularly  important  in  the current  economic climate  in  which  world  growth  has  been \nweaker and slower than expected. For example, weak Chinese data continue to cause \nconcern, and growth in Japan and the eurozone remains fragile at best (Deloitte 2019). \n\nThe  prime  objective  of  this  policy  is  to  protect  the  lowest-income  households  and \nfoster domestic  industrial  growth.  However,  in  most  cases,  a  government\u2019s  energy  \nbill  is  enormous  and  deleterious;  it  strains  a  country\u2019s  fiscal  revenues,  misallocates  \nthe  distribution  of  income,  and  perpetuates  damaging  a  large  proportion  of  economic \nactivity.  Energy  subsidies  are  a  costly  way  of  benefitting  the  poor,  but  from  the \ngovernments\u2019  perspective,  this  assistance  should  be  minimal.  However,  there  has  \nbeen much controversy about this unfavorable economic policy. The many contentious \ndebates  about  both  public  agencies\u2019  budget  balances  and  fairness  are  insufficient  \nto  enable  these  agents  to  implement  this  reform  appropriately  (Inchauste  and \nVictor 2017). \n\nThese energy subsidization issues are widely acknowledged; however, the total subsidy \nlevel remains high. For instance, consumer subsidies accounted for 0.7% of the global \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2013  (Coady  et  al.  2015).  This  is  because  energy \nsubsidies are often closely related to the political economy.  \n\nThe  experience  of  this  reform  depends  on  many  factors,  such  as  the  timing, \ncommunication strategy, and mitigating measurements. Many countries have begun to \nundergo  major  energy  reforms  to  ensure  that  their  governments\u2019  fiscal  budgets  are \nsustainable  and  accountable.  Also,  research  of  fuel  subsidy  reform  in  the  context  of  \nthe  political  social  economy  is  imperative  in  the  current  oil-exporting  countries.  This \nstudy,  therefore,  aims  to  explore  the  political  economy  of  energy  reform  in  selected  \nAsia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies.1 The APEC countries selected \nfor  this  study  are  Brunei  Darussalam,  Chile,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC), \nIndonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian \nFederation, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n\nOne  of the  motivations for  analyzing the  APEC  economies  is that this  region  has the \nhighest  world  energy  demand  and  includes four  out  of  the  world\u2019s  five largest  energy \nusers (the PRC, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States). Additionally, this \nregion contains some of the fastest-growing economies in the world as well as the major \nenergy producers and consumers.  \n\nOur  research  aims  to  investigate  the  factors  that  can  affect  subsidy  policy  decision-\nmaking in  the APEC  region. In  this  paper,  we focus  on  examining the  factors  that are \nmost likely to have an impact on the removal of subsidy policies and determining why \nagents find it difficult to eliminate a policy once it is in place. \n\nVan Beers and Strand (2013) stated that a nation with strong economic growth and high \nachievement of the GDP per capita can generate higher oil prices. In most cases, these \n\n1   APEC comprises 21 members.  \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nhigher-income countries will tend to have higher fuel prices. Thus, the rate of subsidies \nimposed by these governments is relatively low but taxes are considered relatively high. \nThis is because the cost of oil prices in these countries includes refining, transportation, \nand distribution costs. The variation in these costs will certainly affect the overall retail \noil prices in these countries. \n\nThis  study  is  particularly  relevant concerning  the  last  two  years  because of  the sharp \ndecline in world oil prices. The low oil prices have created an opportunity for policymakers \nto implement such reform to enhance governments\u2019 fiscal position (Inchauste and Victor \n2017). Reform is urgently needed to prevent countries\u2019 economies from further distorting \nthe local energy prices and government expenditures. Besides, this paper aims to revisit \nthe  political-economic  doctrine  of this  region.  It  also  provides  a  comprehensive  policy \nimplication  to  help  these  governments  achieve  their  commitment  to  phasing  out \ninefficient fossil fuel subsidies.  \n\nAnother major contribution that this paper makes is adopting an empirical approach to \ninvestigate the political factors that can exert an impact on fuel subsidy policies, which \nmany previous studies have found difficult to support (Anderson 1995; Alderman 2002; \nSovacool  2017). Also,  the  variables  applied  in  this study  contain  some  hidden  factors \nconcerning the fuel prices that several APEC governments are tentatively subsidizing. \nTherefore,  applying  institutional  capacities,  such  as  control  of  corruption,  GDP, \ngovernment effectiveness, and political stability, can explain governments\u2019 decisions to \nremove fuel subsidy policies when applying domestic oil prices. This approach has also \nbeen used in other literature to address the elements absent from fuel subsidy policies \n(Joseph 2010; Kotsogiannis and Rizzo 2016). \n\nNumerous  energy  policy  studies  have  asserted  that  governments  should  implement \nsubsidies only when they are essential, for example in the case of research support for \nnew  technologies;  the  remainder  should  be  dismantled  (International  Energy  Agency \n2008; Victor 2009). Following this initiative, the research goal of this study is to focus in-\ndepth on a political perspective and provide policymakers with a rich source of political-\neconomic background about the economic situation that enables the policy reform to be \nimplemented effectively and efficiently. \n\nIncorporating such political factors in the fossil fuel subsidization reform is highly complex \nand  problematic.  Many  policy  makers  find  it  extremely  difficult  to  remove  an  energy \nsubsidy policy. This paper, therefore, aims to revisit the issue of political factors in energy \nreform; helping political leaders or interest groups resolve policy failure is as important \nas their decision to eliminate an energy subsidy.  \n\nThis study  proceeds  as follows. Section  2  discusses the current  development  in fossil \nfuel subsidy reforms in selected APEC economies. A discussion on the data sources and \nmethodology used in this study is provided in Section 3. Section 4 presents an analysis \nof the empirical results. Conclusions and policy implications are presented in Section 5. \n\n2.  OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDY \n\nREFORM AND THE POLITICAL ECONOMY \nPERSPECTIVE IN APEC ECONOMIES \n\nAPEC is a regional economic forum that was established in 1989. The objective of APEC \nis to support and sustain the economic growth of Asia and the Pacific economies. This \nforum has 21 member countries and is a key player in the world economic and energy \nlandscape. Accounting for about 60% of the world\u2019s energy demand in 2014, the APEC \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nregion includes four of the world\u2019s five largest energy users: the PRC, the United States, \nthe Russian Federation, and Japan. The APEC member countries are also the world\u2019s \nlargest energy producers and consumers (APEC 2017).

It is estimated that \nthe energy consumption in this region accounted for around 40% of the worldwide total \nbetween 2000 and 2014, due to the rapid economic growth and increasing population \nassociated  with  rising  per  capita  income  (International  Energy  Agency  2017).  Energy \npolicy  development,  including  that  related  to  fossil  fuel  subsidies,  has  become  a \ncontentious issue in shaping the global energy trends.  \n\nSince  2014,  the  leaders  of  the  APEC  economies  have  renewed  their  commitment  by \nconsidering the urgent need to implement subsidy reform. Several APEC countries have \npersistently attempted to abolish this policy gradually. The Philippines was the first nation \nin this economy to complete its oil subsidy policy removal, followed by a wave of reforms \nin other member countries, such as the PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mexico, resulting \nin  rapid  oil  price  declines.  The  calls for fossil fuel subsidy  reform include the  need for \nmore transparency on fossil fuel subsidies (Gerasimchuk et al. 2017). Figure 1 shows \nthe recent development of fuel subsidy reforms in the APEC economies, the process of \nwhich began since post the Asian currency crisis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nFigure 1: Fuel Subsidy Reform in Selected APEC Member Nations \n\nSource: International Energy Agency (2017). \n\n \n\nEnergy  subsidies  are  one  of  the  most  pervasive  and  controversial  fiscal  policy  tools  \n(El-Katiri  and  Fattouh  2015).  These  policies  are  widely  perceived  as  providing \nmajor economic  and  social  benefits  for  a  country.  Subsidies  for  energy  consumption, \nwhich  economists  have  widely  discussed,  are  still  a  debatable  topic  regarding  the \neffectiveness  and  fairness  of  this  policy.  Agents  implementing  the  policy  encounter \nconsiderable  pressure  on  government  finances  and  the  undermining  of  fiscal \nsustainability (Inchauste and Victor 2017). However, discussion about this policy reform \noccurs  for  many  reasons:  for  example,  regarding  strengthening  the  economy  by \nincreasing  sectoral  industrial  growth  as  well  as  alleviating  unemployment  to  avoid \ndissatisfaction among the general public (van Beers and Strand 2013). \n\nSeveral studies have discussed fossil subsidy reform from various standpoints (Kojima \n2012; Vagliasindi 2012a,b; Cottarelli et al. 2013; International Energy Agency 2014). A \nrecent  study  by  Vigliasindi  (2012a)  demonstrated  that  fuel  subsidy  rates  are  being \nreduced  in  some countries  as  a  result  of  policy  reform  initiated  by  their  governments. \nHowever, the pace of the overall restructuring of this policy is slow. This is because these \nsubsidy reforms are extremely difficult to implement and put in place. The existence of \nfossil  fuel  subsidies  raises  a  range  of  important  economic  and  political  issues  that \nurgently  need to  be  addressed. This  study, therefore,  aims  to  discuss  how  the  overall \neffect  of  fuel  subsidies  influences  economic  performance.  The  impact  on  growth  and \ndevelopment through energy subsidy reforms and the reasons why most governments \nstill subsidize energy are important issues that need to be included and conveyed in this \nstudy. \n\nWhy  is  energy  reform  such  a  long  and  difficult  task  for  policymakers?  Inchauste  and \nVictor (2017) believe that reformers, such as policymakers, take on a challenging task \nwhen  altering  energy  subsidies  because,  once  implemented,  these  subsidies  tend  to \npersist. They specify that three basic logics drive reform, which is important for reformers \nwhen  altering  an  energy  subsidy  policy.  The  first  is  the  nation\u2019s  fiscal  burden.  The \ngovernment, particularly once elected, manages subsidy costs as the main priority. This \nis because their constituents evaluate the government by considering, for the most part, \nthe government\u2019s performance; these restructured bills can be very costly and not viable \nfor a country\u2019s economic growth or its budget. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nThe second is the burden imposed on influential interest groups and stakeholders. These \npolicies create a significant benefit for well-organized interest groups (such as the bulk \ndistribution companies in Ghana). Additionally, they develop visible costs for organizing \ninterest  groups  with  special  privileges  to  easily  access  liberating  public  funds  using \nunconventional policy through the restructuring of the policy (Inchauste and Victor 2017). \n\nThe third is that the policies deliver an inefficient benefit to the poor. The study by Coady \net al. (2015) showed that energy subsidies need to target low-income groups better; they \nare  inefficient  in  benefiting  the  poor  in  many  ways.  Therefore,  some  countries  with \nsubstantial  energy subsidy costs  have shifted to  a more  energy-efficient approach  by \nimproving how these subsidies are allocated. \n\nCommander  (2012)  stated  that  various  factors  are  important  in  explaining  the \ngovernment\u2019s institutional capacity for using energy subsidies in the APEC region. These \ninclude  income  buffering  to  prevent  price  volatility  during  a  price  shock,  lobbying \nparticular vested interest groups and allowing national patrimony to allocate government \nrevenue  flow  from  natural  resources  more  unevenly  among  the  population,  and \ncomponents  of  industrial  policies  aimed  at  supporting  production.  They  also  include \nreinforcing external competitiveness by supporting the export orientation of the economy \nand  diversifying  the  energy  supply  by  reducing  the  dependence  on fossil fuel  imports \nthrough subsidies. \n\nFuel subsidies are usually imposed when a government sets the petrol price below the \nmarket or international price. Several research papers have revealed that this behavior \ncan induce overuse of energy in a country and undermine its overall output (Cornillie and \nFankhauser 2004; Hang and Tu 2007). More generally, governments decide to resort to \nenergy subsidies because they lack other effective avenues and the institutional capacity \nassociated with the implementation of the policy. For example, many developing nations \nhave  limited their  bureaucratic capacity  and  ability to  monitor  the  policy,  resulting  in  a \nrelatively small proportion of fiscal revenues being raised from income and profit taxes.  \n\nA government\u2019s institutional capacity appears to be incorporated into the type of political \nsystem  in  a country.2 The  institutional  quality  and  the  political  regime  are  interrelated. \nThese  factors  are  usually  used  to  determine  the  competitiveness  or  democracy  of  a \nregime  by  implementing  a  better  institutional  policy.  Indeed,  governments  with  weak \ninstitutions, e.g., a large number of developing countries that lack a workable mechanism \nfor  dialogue  and  resolution,  particularly  non-democratic  regimes,  have  tended  to \nintroduce  or  extend  universal  energy  subsidies,  sometimes  irrespective  of  fiscal  and \nother consequences. In general, policy decision-making appears to be problematic for \ngovernments when implementing energy reforms (Commander 2012). \n\nThere are both theoretical and practical reasons why autocracies experience difficulties \nin  implementing  reforms;  energy  reforms can  be challenging  and complex. As  well  as \nbeing  extremely  complex  and  involving  many  country-specific  factors,  some  general \nfeatures of these reforms stand out. These include loss of economic rents by the affected \nparties, such as companies, individuals, or households, as well as a political dimension. \nPoliticians may  be  particularly  affected  by  this  reform  simply  because  it  may  impact  a \nrecipient\u2019s ability to fund political parties, which, in turn, provides these autocracies with \npreferential treatment  (Acemoglu  and  Robinson  2001).  While  energy  reforms certainly \ninvolve considerable complexity, an appropriate focus for better policy institutions, such \nfurther \nas  effective  communication, \n\nredistribution  measures,  and \n\nrevenue \n\n2   The institutional factors include bureaucratic quality, corruption, a lack of the rule of law, and democratic \n\naccountability. \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\ncomplementary  policies,  is  key  in  removing  the  constraints  that  affect  how  the  key \nplayers interact and the associated outcomes. \n\n3.  DATA SOURCES AND EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY \n\nVarious sources have been used to obtain the data in this study. Parameters such as \nbureaucratic  quality, corruption,  and  democratic  accountability  were  obtained  from  the \nInternational  Country  Risk  Guide  issued  by the Political  Risk Services  group. Specific \ngovernment sources in the APEC region and various websites were used to provide the \ncountry-specific  panel  data sets.  The sample  period  for  the  panel  data sets  was  from \n1991 to 2018. Other than the International Country Risk Guide indicators, the World Bank \nand the International Monetary Fund were used to obtain economic indicators, such as \nthe GDP, for each member country. \n\nThe analysis in this study was applied to selected APEC economies that have imposed \nfuel subsidies. These APEC member countries are Brunei Darussalam, Chile, the PRC, \nIndonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian \nFederation, Thailand, and Viet Nam. These APEC nations are those that have subsidized \nat least one fuel product and have made progress in restructuring this policy in the last \n20 years. \n\nFollowing  van  Beers  and  Strand  (2013)  and  Kolerus  and  Touna-Mama  (2016),  we \ndeveloped  the  analytical  framework  for  this  study.

Our \nresearch interest in this study was to develop a comprehensive and fundamental model \nthat  is  appropriate  to  examine  the  benefit  of  the  fossil  fuel  energy  reform  across  two \nparties:  (i) civilians  and  (ii)  political  leaders. This  framework  offers  a strong  and  good \nstarting point for political-economic analysis. We adopted a model using selected APEC \neconomies to use in this research. We then investigated the proportion of energy subsidy \n\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc1)\n\n \n\n3   The macro policy control reflects an exogenous fiscal policy stance and the proxy for monetary policy. \n4   In measuring fuel prices, Koplow (2009) stated that the price gap approach is appealing. This approach \ncan  deal  with  many  complexities  of  energy  policy  interventions.  This  is  because  energy  prices  are  a \nprimary driver of economic behavior and changes in consumer prices. \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nthat will be affected by these two parties as a result of the structural reforms of this policy. \nWe  have  come  to  believe  that  this  can  contribute  some  beneficial  values  to  help \npolicymakers understand the benefits and costs across many diverse stakeholders; this \nis often essential for successful subsidy reform.5 \n\nAs mentioned previously, the APEC economies are some of the most significant energy \nproducers  and  consumers.  Also,  in  recent  years,  there  have  been  many  signs  of \nprogress  about  energy  subsidy  reforms  in  these  economies,  but  a  lot  of  work  is  \nstill required in this area. The elimination of fuel subsidies can lead to strong protest from \nthe  general  public  and  the  opposition  parties.  The  reason  is  that  it  can  affect \ndisadvantaged income citizens when they receive their energy bills. Therefore, our paper \naims  to  bridge  the  gap  by  focusing  on  policy-driven  issues  regarding  subsidies  and \nilluminating how the policy process can be influenced by political leaders in the country. \n\nWe  ran  regressions  of  the  domestic  retail  price  on  the  world  fuel  price,  which  are \nindicators of governance and fiscal and monetary policy variables. We then estimated \nEquation  (1)  with  time  and  country  fixed  effects  and  robust  standard  errors  clustered \non the  country  level.  The  specification  in  Equation  (1)  includes  an  interaction  term \nbetween the world price and each governance variable. These two variables (the world \noil  price  and  the  individual  governance  variable)  were  used  to  test  the  relationship \nbetween these two parameters under different world price pressures. Equation (1) was \nalso  used  to  estimate  a  dummy  for  oil  exporters  incorporated  into  each  governance \nvariable, which could be used to test for the role of oil exporters.  \n\nIn calibrating the data set, we first used ordinary least squares (OLS) to analyze the data, \nfollowed by country fixed-effect (FE) regression. The fuel product used in this study was \nthe local gasoline with a retail price in US dollars. The data covered a broad range of \nAPEC countries and included the Asian financial crisis, the oil price spike in 2008, and \nthe subsequent decline during the global financial crisis. The purpose of including these \nperiods was to allow for the isolation of the effect of governance on local retail fuel prices \nand  thus  on  subsidization  policies.  Additionally,  these  periods  involved  substantial \nvariation  across  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  over  time.  For  instance,  this  substantial \nchange included the upsurge of reforms as the world oil price spiked at the beginning of \nthe millennium, with a severe shortfall of government revenues. Many APEC economies, \nincluding the PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mexico, had already started to reconsider \neliminating energy subsidies on many fuel products, e.g., gasoline, diesel, and liquefied \npetroleum gas.  \n\n4.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nTable 2 explains the outcome concerning the extent to which governance and consumer \ngroups can affect fuel prices as a result of the decision to remove a fuel subsidization \npolicy. The table presents both OLS and FE panel estimations and the regression of local \nretail fuel prices according to governance indicators and various controls. We conducted \nboth OLS and FE regression analyses using 90, 95, and 99 % significance levels. The \nvariance of these three significance levels did not show much change in the empirical \noutcomes. \nregression  \ndecided \nat a 95% significance level, which provided the most robust and convincing results in this \nstudy. \n\nTherefore, \n\napply \n\nthe \n\nwe \n\nto \n\n5   Subsidies usually takes the form of price controls by many governments.  \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nTable 2: Impact of Governance on Domestic Fuel Prices  \n\n \n\nwop \n\nGDP \n\nCC \n\nGE \n\nPS \n\nRQ \n\nROL \n\nACC \n\nExtdebt \n\nConstant \n\n(1) \nOLS \n0.009** \n(0.001) \n\u22121.17E\u221206** \n(3.73E\u221206) \n0.117** \n(0.047) \n\u22120.087** \n(0.049) \n\u22120.114** \n(0.025) \n\u22120.004** \n(0.048) \n0.121** \n(0.048) \n0.094** \n(0.028) \n\u22120.0001** \n(0.0002) \n0.320** (0.033) \n\n \n\n13.99** \n(3.77E\u221235) \n\u22120.31** \n(0.754) \n0.013** \n(2.49) \n\u22121.77** \n(0.077) \n\u22124.57** \n(6.81E\u221206) \n\u22120.09** \n(0.927) \n2.53** \n(0.012) \n3.37** \n(0.001) \n\u22120.65** \n(0.515) \n9.67** \n(1.26E\u221219) \n \n \n \n\n(2) \nFixed Effect \n0.364** \n(0.030) \n\u22124.42-E06** \n(2.39E\u221206) \n0.122** \n(0.057) \n\u22120.144** \n(0.052) \n\u22120.092** \n(0.028) \n0.042** \n(0.054) \n0.120** \n(0.054) \n0.099** \n(0.027) \n0.000** \n(0.0003) \n0.766** \n(0.03) \n336 \n0.698 \n28 \n\n \n\n12.41** \n(5.77E\u221207) \n\u22121.81** \n(0.072) \n2.13** \n(0.034) \n\u22122.75** \n(0.006) \n\u22123.22** \n(0.001) \n0.79** \n(0.433) \n2.22** \n(0.027) \n3.66** \n(0.0003) \n0.26** \n(0.793) \n25.45** \n(6.30E\u221277) \n \n \n \n\nObservations \nR-squared \nNumber of clusters \n\n336 \n0.548 \n28 \n\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses. ** p < 0.05. \n\nThe  findings  of  this  research  are  in  line  with  the  outcome  discussed  by  Kolerus  and \nTouna-Mama  (2016).  They  show  that  fluctuations  in  the  domestic  retail  price  are \nsignificantly correlated with the world oil price, good governance, political stability, control \nof corruption, and law and order. By contrast, a nation\u2019s income, such as GDP, external \ndebt, government effectiveness, and regulatory quality are negatively correlated with the \nlocal  domestic  fuel  price.  This  finding  confirms  that  when  the  world  oil  price  is \nplummeting,  the  decision  to  remove  a  fuel  subsidization  policy  impacts  the  national \nincome. \n\nOur study shows that countries adopting good government institutions and transparent \npublic policies tend to have higher domestic retail fuel prices. It shows that variables such \nas corruption control, government accountability, the rule of law, and world oil prices play \na critical role in determining decisions regarding fuel subsidization policies and domestic \nretail \nlevels,  \nand the results indicate that the transparency of institutional policies and governance can \naffect  domestic  fuel  prices.  In  fact,  due  to  the  robustness  of  these  variables  in  \nthe  model,  we  can  state  that  these  factors  can  influence  the  decisions  made  by \ngovernment agencies before deciding to abolish a fossil fuel subsidization policy. \n\nprices.  These \n\nsignificance \n\nvariables \n\np-value \n\nshow \n\nfour \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nThe empirical outcomes in this study also show their consistency with the current trend \nof  the  economic climate  in  which  crude  oil  prices  have  now  plummeted  to  USD23  per \nbarrel. This is worth noting to explain a nation\u2019s external debt, GDP, and political stability, \neven though the outcomes show insignificance. The outcomes are appealing because \nour findings reveal that oil-exporting countries are facing challenging times. The majority \nof  these  countries  are  heavily  dependent  on  their  oil  revenues,  which  have  declined \nsubstantially. Indeed, lower pricing can lead to higher counterparty credit risk.  \n\nThe  governments  that  have  decided  to  phase  out  subsidy  policies  will  experience  an \nextremely  tough  time  economically,  politically,  and  socially  during  any  unprecedented \nperiods (as with the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant global economic shutdown). Our \nstudy concludes that governments should review their subsidy policy at this critical time \nand  ensure  that this  policy  is  applied  by  enhancing  its specific  objective of  protecting \nvulnerable citizens. To a lesser extent, governments should be able to implement policies \nthat are effective and cheaper for both the general public and several interest groups. \n\nFuel  subsidization  is  the  key  policy  implemented  by  government  agencies  to  assist \nvulnerable  groups.  However, the  reform  of  this  policy  remains  politically controversial. \nLockwood  (2015)  and  Rentschler  and  Bazilian  (2017)  stated  that  reforms  to  remove \nsubsidies  for  petrol  and  diesel  are,  to  a  certain  extent,  almost  universally  politically \ncontroversial, particularly in emerging economies such as Indonesia and Malaysia.6 Fuel \nsubsidy reform can be politically difficult. A reform undertaken without proper planning \nby government agencies can lead to violent street protests, either immediately or at a \nlater date. To reiterate, this issue is a key objective for discussion in this study. \n\nNevertheless,  political-economic  challenges  can  create  the  most  severe  obstacles  to \ntransforming both producer and consumer fuel subsidies. Overall experience suggests \nthat successful subsidy reforms in the past have been implemented under both high and \nlow fuel prices. However, this implies that the current lower oil prices are conducive to, \nbut not essential for, reform (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). The outcome of this study \nsuggests that institutional and governance factors are common political determinants for \nluring  voters  or  influential  interest  groups,  rather  than  being  sound  economic  welfare \nfactors for governments to assist the poor income groups. \n\nVariables such as governance (Govit) and GDP are found to be negatively associated \nwith fuel subsidies, but the parameter of corruption control can be positively correlated \nwith  fuel  price. 7  Based  on  the  data  presented  in  Table  2,  we  can  argue  that  the \nelimination of the fuel subsidization policy in APEC countries is solely dependent on the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  government.  A  rational,  sound  and  effective  institutional \ngovernment  policy  can  help  determine  what  contributes  to  the  public  acceptance  of \nreforms (e.g., advance publicity can be useful in preventing some interest groups from \nhiding  their  self-interested  purpose,  arguing  that  the  reform  creates  hardship  or \nuncertainty for a wider community). Similarly to the study by Alderman (2002), we argue \nthat this is one of the useful strategies that need to be addressed in APEC countries. To \nvarying  degrees,  the  strategy  has  been  implemented  successfully  in  Bangladesh, \nPakistan, and Zimbabwe (Alderman 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6   The fuel subsidy reform was implemented under the Barisan Nasional government in 2013. However, the \nnewly elected Pakatan Harapan government intends to reintroduce this policy as one of its agenda items \nin its election campaign.  \n\n7   Kotsogiannis and Rizzo (2016) stated that in a country with a relatively low level of corruption, the level \n\nof fuel subsidies can be reduced substantially because the corruption control has increased. \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nThe  findings  of  this  study  indicate  that  political  perceptions  about  fuel  subsidization \npolicies can  be  complicated.  The  policies involve many  economic,  political,  and social \ncontexts. The contentious issues of political barriers in the APEC countries\u2019 fuel subsidy \npolicies will continue; the journey towards the implementation of this reform cannot be \nstraightforward.  Time  is  needed  to  remove  these  barriers  and  prevent  rent-seeking \nbehavior  by  entrenched  interest  groups  that  only  benefit  from  government  fuel \nsubsidization.  \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nThis study addressed the contentious debate on the political issues that influence energy \nsubsidy reform in selected APEC countries. It also incorporated some factors that can \nexert an impact on the decision to remove the fuel subsidy policy using the oil price. We \nused a panel data set from 1991 to 2018 in selected APEC economies to conduct both \nOLS  and  FE  regression  analyses.  Regardless  of  the  differences  in  the  degree  of \ndemocracy,  the  different  levels  of  economic  growth,  the  status  as  an  importing  or  an \nexporting  net  oil  country,  or  the  differences  in  energy  consumption  among  these \ncountries, energy subsidy reforms and political perspectives are critical issues that affect \nthe APEC economies.  \n\nThe findings of this study are consistent with previous literature. They show that changes \nin domestic fuel prices can have a significant impact on a nation\u2019s income level and its \ninstitutional policy capacity. The empirical outcome of this research strongly supports the \nassertion that strong and effective governance, such as the ability to control corruption, \ngovernment  effectiveness,  political  stability,  regulatory  quality,  law  and  order,  and \ntransparency, is the key point that determines the accomplishment of fuel subsidization \npolicies.  Nonetheless, this  study  bears some similarity to  other  previous  research that \nindicates that a sound governance institutional policy is a key factor in oil and gas subsidy \nreform involving groups with different income levels.  \n\nThis  research  is  particularly  important  for  APEC  member  countries  that  wish  to \nimplement a sound, effective, and convincing policy for their population that removes the \nfuel  subsidy  policy  and  benefits  the  population  directly.  However,  the  rationality  of \npoliticians convincing a community of the benefit of this policy remains doubtful, and it \ndepends on the trust between politicians and the people. In this case, democracy plays \na critical role and is the best strategy for eliminating a fuel subsidy policy. \n\nDomestic energy pricing is inevitably political in many APEC countries and remains an \nimportant  agenda  for  many  governments.  An  example  of  this  is  the  inability  of  the \nMalaysian  Alliance  of  Hope  (Pakatan  Harapan)  government  to  implement  a  better \nplan for  fuel  pricing  reform.  In  large,  emerging  economies,  such  as  the  PRC  and  the \nRussian  Federation,  routes  to  reform  are  likely  to  be  continued.  The  energy  pricing \nreforms  involve  transforming  political  rents  into  forms  that  are  more  functional  for \nchanging the whole nature of emerging market economies. For energy policy reformers, \na deep understanding of the nature of political rent and the strategy for managing it in \nthese large, emerging economies are two of the challenging requirements for discovering \nthose routes.  \n\nMany  of  our conclusions  are  novel,  but much  research  needs  to  be  conducted in  the \nfuture, perhaps applying more sophisticated research techniques and/ updated data in \nthis area. Our conclusions suggest that energy social welfare can be allocated equally \nand fairly through sound policy advice that has been discussed earlier in Section 2. Even \nthough  the  data  set  we  apply  in  this  paper  is  readily  available,  our  data  still  have \nlimitations. One of these is that our gasoline data use US dollars. Using gasoline data in \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nthe  home  country\u2019s  denomination  would  generally  offer  more  interesting  empirical \noutcomes.  \n\nIn  our  future  research,  we  will  conduct  more  sophisticated  and  robust  analyses  in \nthis area.  Many  studies  address  the  political  issues  in  energy  reform  according  to \ntheoretical  perspectives.  Not  much  research  has  been  conducted  with  an  empirical \napproach  using  econometric  models.  Therefore, the  researchers  aim to conduct more \nconclusive  and  comprehensive  research  concerning  energy  price  reform.  Also,  in \nthe future,  we  intend  to  pursue  empirical  work  where  appropriate  models  and  a \ncomprehensive data set are used.  \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1176 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nFoo, Lean, and Salim \n\nAcemoglu, D., and Robinson, J.

The issues with these subsidies are \nfully acknowledged by many energy economists; however, the total subsidy level remains high. \nThis is because energy subsidies are often closely related to the political economy viewpoint. \nMoreover,  the  rationale  underlying  fossil  fuel  subsidies,  particularly  concerning  political, \neconomic,  and social contexts, is to  reduce  energy  poverty,  ensure  access  to  energy,  and \nredistribute the wealth that stems from the exploitation of national resources. Although there \nis  considerable  controversy  surrounding  the  efficiency  of  these  policies,  energy  subsidies \nconfer private benefits on particular interest groups and, once implemented, tend to persist. \nThis  paper  discusses  and  models  various  aspects  of  the  political  economy  of  fuel  subsidy \nreform in selected Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. Applying a panel \ndata set from the period 1991\u20132018, the paper provides an empirical analysis of the economic \nand  political  perspectives  of  fuel  prices  in APEC countries  resulting from the  elimination  of \nfossil fuel subsidization policies. Our findings robustly support the current economic trend of \nthose governments that have decided to phase out fossil fuel energy policies. Based on these \nfindings, we conclude that a range of economic, political, and social parameters systematically \ninfluence fuel prices.  \n \nKeywords: APEC, political economy, subsidies \n \nJEL Classification: E61, Q43, Q48 \n \n", " \n"]}
