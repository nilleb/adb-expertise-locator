VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\ntransparency\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\nefficiency Quality Flexibility\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction  \u2022\tContract management  \u2022\tOpen competitive \ncosts support bidding\n\u2022\tIncreased skills \u2022\tPrompt resolution of  \u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level  complaints \u2022\tAccreditation \ntechnology usage \u2022\tImproved developing  for alternative \n\u2022\tImproved  member country  procurement \nprocurement planning procurement process  arrangements\n\u2022\tSupport and  \u2022\tImproved  \u2022\tPrinciples-based \nencouragement  procurement planning decisions\nof e-procurement  \u2022\tGovernance \u2022\tImproved \nsystems \u2022\tContracts with clear  procurement planning\nperformance criteria \u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tMinimal number of  \u2022\tBids with weighted  \ncomplaints proposal  \n\u2022\tImproved ADB  criteria \nprocesses \nFairness\ntime\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.", "About This Publication vii\nobjective\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \nLiving Document\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\nthe reader \nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs.

Background\n2.1  In FCAS and emergency situations, the design and implementation \nof projects financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan or grant, or by ADB-\nadministered funds, may benefit from special considerations, taking into account \nthe particular circumstances of each country. Similarly, in emergency situations, \nADB\u2019s internal regulations on its lending and grant operations allow projects to \nbenefit from the provisions on disaster and emergency assistance outlined in the \nADB Operations Manual.2 Notably,\n(i)  the normal stages of identification, preparation, and appraisal may be \ncondensed;\n(ii)  the decision to authorize negotiations may be taken after a simplified \nreview of a project\u2019s documentation; and\n(iii) turnaround times at key stages of processing may be reduced. \n2.2  The design of an FCAS or emergency project must reflect the specifics of \nthe borrower\u2019s situation as well as the related constraints and risks, to ensure that \nthe project adequately responds to the borrower\u2019s needs and that it can achieve its \nintended results efficiently and with value for money.\n2.3  Furthermore, borrowers and ADB project teams must ensure that they \n\u201cdo no harm\u201d and that they develop and implement plans to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate, or compensate for the potential adverse impacts of assistance projects.3\nB.

", "iii.\u2003Procurement Flexibilities  \nin Fragile, Conflict-Affected,  \nand emergency situations\nA.   Project Design and Procurement Planning\n3.1  The project strategy outlined in the project documents is based on, in the \ncase of FCAS, detailed assessments of the needs, conditions, and expectations, \nincluding the origins and nature of conflicts; and in the case of emergencies, initial \ndamage assessments that can be refined and upgraded over time. The strategy \nshould provide critical policy recommendations for the response to immediate \npriorities along with accompanying long-term actions.\n3.2  Procurement risk assessments are a key instrument used in the \npreparation of a project strategy. From the country and sector/agency procurement \nrisk assessments that feed into the country partnership strategy, to the project-level \nprocurement risk assessment prepared at the project design stage, all are meant \nto inform the project strategy and reflect the specific circumstances of a country, \nsector, or procuring entity that would affect project implementation. The measures \nof flexibility in procurement discussed in this guidance note are intended to \naddress some of the risks identified in these assessments. See the Guidance Note on \nProcurement Risk Framework for further details on procurement risk assessments.\n3.3  While ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) allows flexibility in \nprocessing FCAS projects and emergency assistance, the initial environmental \nexamination, environmental impact assessment, resettlement plan, and/or \nindigenous people\u2019s plan prepared based on the approved frameworks must be \nformulated and approved by ADB before any project-related physical activity starts.\n3.4  The project strategy identifies immediate priority assistance objectives as \nwell as medium-term objectives. These may include \n(i)  a proposal for technical assistance and other forms of investment \nrequired to meet the stated objectives; \n(ii)  an assessment of potential impediments to rapid disbursement, \nincluding associated fiduciary risks and proposed mitigation measures; \n(iii) identification of the exceptional measures required to undertake \nrehabilitation or reconstruction works; \n(iv) an assessment of risks, risk mitigation strategies, and contingency \nresponses; and\n(v)  benchmarks and performance monitoring indicators. ", "Procurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations 7\n3.5  The project implementation arrangements detail the circumstances \nconsidered in the preparation of the procurement plan, and include a description \nof procurement processing, procurement risks, and selection methods. The \nproject\u2019s procurement plan must be updated regularly (e.g., on each review mission \nconducted by the project team), and review mission reports should include a \njustification for changes to the procurement plan. See the Guidance Note on Strategic \nProcurement Planning for further details on the procurement planning process.\n3.6  Some of the things to keep in mind during the design and preparation for \nprojects in FCAS and emergency situations are the following:\n(i)  Keep the design of the project administration manual (PAM) and \nthe related procurement plan and packaging short, simple, and fit for \npurpose.\n(ii)  Understand the prevailing political economy, cultural sensitivities, and \nthe severity and geographic spread of any conflict that may affect the \ncountry.\n(iii)  Understand the supply chain limitations (access to imports, primary \ninputs, labor, electricity, water supply, banking services, etc.) and \nconstraints to communications, transport, and other logistical factors \naffecting the country.\n(iv)  Assess labor risks and other key social factors, including child labor \nconditions, and ensure that workers are neither trafficked nor \nworking under forced labor, especially under rapid procurement and \ncontracting.\n(v)  Use procurement and selection methods that suit the situation and \nthat will deliver the best outcomes.\n(vi)  Consider adaptable project controls, such as levels of prior and post \nreview (sampling), which can be adjusted as capacity improves.\n(vii)  Consider using framework agreements where feasible.\n(viii) Consider the need to supplement the capacity of the executing \nagency in managing and administering contracts, e.g., with consultant \nsupport.\n(ix)  Consider relying on other institutions with operations in the \ncountry, such as United Nations (UN) agencies, other multilateral \ndevelopment banks, donors, civil society organizations (CSOs), etc.\n(x)  Enable communities to participate in the design and subsequent \nimplementation of works. \nB.   Procurement Preparedness\n3.7  Procurement is an essential component of emergency, conflict, and disaster \npreparedness and response. Various measures can be taken before an emergency, \nconflict, or disaster occurs to optimize the capacity of procurement systems to \nrespond effectively to the situation. The measures outlined below are essential to \naddress the challenges to procurement preparedness in any such situation.", "8 Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n3.8  Emergency procurement preparedness involves actions taken in advance \nof an emergency that will enhance the capacity of authorities to address the \nsituation.

Situational Response\n3.9  The ADB Operations Manual, Disaster and Emergency Assistance section \n(footnote 2) allows for a broad spectrum of response measures in emergency \nsituations, in terms of financing and simplified procedures for project processing \nand implementation.\n3.10  For FCAS and emergencies, ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement regulations also \nallow for greater flexibility in designing and conducting procurement. Below is a \nlist of measures that can be adopted in consultation with borrowers and other \ndevelopment partners:\n(i)  Fiduciary arrangements normally required during the preparation \nperiod may be deferred to the implementation stage. For example, the \nfinalization of the PAM may be postponed and the procurement plan \npushed back to after project start-up, and a simplified PAM and initial \nprocurement plan may be used in project processing documents.\n(ii)  Procurement may be conducted using the borrower\u2019s national \nprocurement arrangements, provided that these are acceptable to \nADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s core procurement principles.\n(iii) Where no viable implementation capacity or alternative exists, ADB \nmay, at the request of the borrower, execute start-up activities on \nbehalf of the borrower. For example, under a loan or grant project, \nADB may select the project implementation support consultant \nwho will assist the borrower with the implementation of the project, \nincluding in the conduct of further procurement activities.\n(iv) The Director General of ADB\u2019s Procurement, Portfolio and Financial \nManagement Department may provisionally increase the delegation \nthresholds granted to procurement staff so they are fully empowered \nto act and provide clearances in a timely manner. ", "10 Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n3.11  The Appendix lists measures that may, at the request of the borrower, \nbe considered and put into place to answer the particular challenges of FCAS and \nemergencies.\nD.   Application of ADB Regulations and Procedures \nduring Emergencies\n3.12  During the immediate response and recovery phase of an emergency \nor conflict, ADB may accept the use of the borrower\u2019s national procurement \narrangements, provided that these procedures are consistent with ADB\u2019s core \nprocurement principles and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) and Integrity Principles and Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto\u00a0time). \n3.13  Normally, ADB\u2019s prior review will not be required during the immediate \nresponse phase of an emergency, since available time is limited. Prior review should \nonly be used in exceptional cases and responses will be provided promptly. ADB\u2019s \noversight of procurement may be enhanced through increased implementation \nsupport and/or increased post review (sampling).\nE.   Operational Context and Market Conditions\n3.14  The supply market and local market conditions should be assessed \nperiodically. Refer to the Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning for \nfurther details.\n3.15  Although periodic market assessments may be undertaken for FCAS \ncountries, it may be necessary to conduct an update of local conditions, especially \nin the aftermath of an emergency event. This can be achieved quickly through \ninformal, ad hoc surveys and by involving local authorities, communities, workers, \nworkers\u2019 representatives, CSOs, groups of people with disabilities, and businesses in \nthe affected areas. ADB resident missions could also assist in this exercise.\n3.16  In addition to market assessments, the following aspects may also \nbe considered when preparing the procurement plan of projects in FCAS and \nemergency situations.\n1.  security requirements in the Country\n3.17  Each country will present different security issues that have an impact on \nprocurement processes and the performance of contracts. Security considerations \nare often reflected in the prices quoted for goods, works, and services. To ensure \ngreater transparency and more realistic pricing, the cost of security should \nbe identified as a separate line item in contracts to facilitate and manage the \nimpact on cost if the security situation in the country changes during contract \nimplementation.", "Procurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations 11\n2.  Contracting Core government services to external Providers\n3.18  Contracting core government services to external providers may be an \noption when local government is recovering from conflict and, as a result, has \nlittle or no capacity to deliver essential public services or functions, e.g., on public \nfinancial management, legislative drafting, treasury reform, management of health \nservices, private sector development, management of state-owned enterprises, etc. \n3.19  The contracting out of these services is a possible short-term solution; \nhowever, there are potential political and technical risks associated with this \napproach that need to be considered at the project appraisal stage. Contracting for \nthese services should be subject to appropriate procurement procedures to ensure \nthat quality services are contracted.\n3.  governance\n3.20  There is an inherently high risk that procurement in FCAS and emergency \noperations could be affected by conflicts of interest or by fraudulent or corrupt \nactivities of some of the stakeholders involved in the procurement process. Also, \nthe likelihood of complications, cost overruns, delays, and poor quality of goods and \nservices may be very high due to capacity constraints, urgency, and general disorder. \n3.21  Developing a sound governance and anticorruption plan for the project \nis a key consideration to help mitigate those risks. In small states, conflict of \ninterest is often an issue and appropriate mitigation measures must be designed to \naddress such situations. Results of project procurement-related reviews (PPRRs) \nconducted by ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) in FCAS \ncountries should be considered in identifying and assessing these integrity risks.12 \nIn the event that integrity concerns are identified, the project team should consult \nOAI13 to help assess and determine if these integrity risks are deemed significant.\nF.   Organizational and Institutional Support\n3.22  Any development assistance project must be supported by sufficient \nattention to the borrower\u2019s organizational and institutional arrangements for \nimplementation, including for procurement. Measures that can be considered for \nFCAS and emergencies include the following:\n12  PPRRs assess project integrity risks by identifying signs of integrity violations through \n(i)\u00a0examination of processes, procedures, and documentation related to procurement,  \nfinancial management, and contract management; and (ii) inspection of project outputs.  \nOAI recommends enhancements to mitigate or eliminate opportunities for integrity violations.  \nAs\u00a0of 2018, OAI has conducted PPRRs in four FCAS countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar,  \nPapua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste.\n13  OAI may be reached through e-mail: integrity@adb.org.", "12 Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n(i)  Within the country. Rapid and appropriate assistance requires ADB \nto work in a flexible and pragmatic way with other institutions.\n(a)  In countries with weak implementation capacity, ADB may \nconsider a request from the borrower to contract other \ninstitutions such as nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and \nCSOs, UN agencies, or other multilateral or bilateral institutions \nto undertake all or part of project implementation, including the \nprocurement functions.\n(b)  Use of the alternative procurement arrangements of another \nmultilateral or bilateral agency or organization involved in \nthe project, or accredited agency of the borrower, should be \nconsidered during project design in accordance with section XII \nof the 2017 procurement policy. In such cases, ADB may agree \nto rely on and apply the procurement rules and procedures of \nthe agency or organization and may agree to such party taking a \nlead role in providing implementation support and monitoring of \nprocurement activities. \n(ii)  Within ADB. ADB procedures and regulations provide several options \nthat support the timely processing of transactions in particularly \nurgent or compelling circumstances. For example, in FCAS and \nemergencies, ADB may provide direct assistance to the borrower by:\n(a)  financing individual consultants to support the borrower in \nproject implementation, including procurement;\n(b)  drafting procurement documents;\n(c)  handling the selection of consultants on behalf of the borrower;\n(d)  assisting in the identification of strengths and weaknesses in bids \nor proposals; and\n(e)  acting as observer in contract negotiations or in dialogues \nbetween the borrower and its consultants, contractors, or \nsuppliers. \n3.23  In any event, the ultimate responsibility for procurement remains with \nthe borrower, and direct assistance by ADB must never result in ADB entering into \ncontracts on behalf of the borrower.\nG.   Use of Procurement Agents\n3.24  When the borrower does not have the required in-house capacity for the \nnecessary procurement or project management activities, hiring a procurement \nagent or project management consultant may be the most efficient option. The \nprocurement agent should be selected in accordance with para. 2.24 of the 2017 \nprocurement regulations.", "Procurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations 13\nH.   Flexible Arrangements for Procurement\n3.25  In FCAS and emergencies, the selection methods, selection arrangements, \nand market approaches used to procure goods, works, and services should be \nsimplified, consistent with the provisions of the 2017 procurement regulations. \nBelow are some measures for consideration.\n1.  Approach to National versus International Markets \n3.26  Bidding procedures targeting the national market using the borrower\u2019s \nown procurement rules and procedures may be used when the procedures for \ninternational advertising are considered inappropriate or too complex due to the \nborrower\u2019s weak implementation capacity, where there is clearly no international \nmarket appetite to participate in the procurement process, or when speed is of the \nessence.\n2.  Flexible Arrangements for the Selection of Consultants\n3.27  Direct selection. Direct selection of consulting firms and individuals \n(paras. 2.17 and 2.18 of the procurement regulations) should be used if it presents \na clear advantage over competition for the required consulting services. Firms \nthat are already working in the country and have a proven track record in similar \nassignments may be the most suitable option for start-up activities. Consultants \nselected on a direct selection basis may be given the opportunity to participate in \nfuture assignments under the same project, provided there is no unresolved conflict \nof interest with the tasks performed under the initial contract. \n3.28  Framework agreements, as described in paras. 2.8 and 2.9 of the \nprocurement regulations, may be appropriate for the procurement of consulting \nservices in emergency situations or for crisis planning, such as for natural disasters. \nSuch framework agreements may be existing borrower agreements to be used in \nADB operations, or they may be established by the borrower specifically for the \nADB project.14\n3.29  Using a \u201cpool of experts\u201d or a list of \u201cpreselected\u201d consulting firms or \nindividual experts may also be considered appropriate to support borrowers at \nvarious steps of project implementation, including procurement processing as well \nas preparation of terms of reference, shortlists, and requests for proposals. \n3.  Flexible Arrangements for Procurement of Goods, Works, \nand\u00a0Nonconsulting Services\n3.30  Direct selection. Direct selection for contracts for goods, works, and \nnonconsulting services may be used to extend an existing contract or to award \nnew contracts in response to disasters or emergencies. For such contracting to \n14  For further details, refer to the Guidance Note on Framework Agreements for Consulting Services.", "14 Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\nbe justified, ADB should be satisfied that the price is reasonable and that no \nsignificant benefit could be derived from further competition. Contractors and \nsuppliers selected under projects financed by other development partners may \nalso be considered for direct selection under an ADB-financed emergency project. \nThe\u00a0direct selection may be from the private sector, UN agencies, suppliers, \ncontractors, or NGOs that are already mobilized and working in the emergency \nareas.\n3.31  Framework agreements may be appropriate for the procurement of \ngoods, works, and services in emergency situations or for crisis planning (such \nas for natural disasters). Such framework agreements may be existing borrower \nagreements to be used in ADB operations, or they may be established by the \nborrower specifically for the ADB project.\n3.32  Request for quotations. Request for quotations (RFQ) (paras. 2.10\u20132.13 \nof the procurement regulations) is a competitive method based on comparison of \nprices obtained from firms for the provision of goods, works, or services that are \ngenerally of low value, low risk, not complex, and can be specified through simple \nrequirements. This method may be appropriate to procure limited quantities \nof readily available, off-the-shelf goods or services, standard specification \ncommodities, or simple civil works of small value, when it is more efficient than \nusing more competitive methods of procurement. \n3.33  Quotations should be obtained through advertisement, or when limited \ncompetition is justified, through an RFQ to a limited number of firms. To ensure \ncompetition, the borrower should request quotations from as many firms as \npossible to allow comparison of normally at least three responsive quotations. In \nsituations where less than three suppliers or contractors are available (or when \nless than three responsive quotations are received), the borrower should note the \nsituation in the procurement records and proceed with the award of contract. There \nis no requirement for the borrower to obtain a no-objection from ADB when there \nare fewer than three quotations; however, those RFQ contracts may be prioritized \nfor ADB\u2019s post review (sampling). \n3.34  Firms must be given sufficient time to prepare and submit their \nquotations. RFQs must include the description and quantity for the works, goods, \nor services, including any installation requirements as appropriate. The request \nmust also indicate the deadline for submission of quotations and specify whether \nquotations are accepted by letter, facsimile, or other electronic means. The \nevaluation of quotations and contract award is carried out based on the criteria \nspecified in the RFQ. The terms of the accepted quotation must be incorporated \nin a contractually binding document. The borrower must keep records of all \nproceedings regarding RFQs.\n3.35  In emergency situations, the RFQ method can also be used even \nfor higher-value contracts; the justification should be noted in the PAM or \nprocurement records as appropriate. Such contracts may be prioritized for post \nreview (sampling).", "Procurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations 15\n3.36  Simplification of pre- and post-qualification criteria. The pre- and \npost-qualification criteria should be set to optimize the participation of local or \nregional contractors and suppliers and may, therefore, be based on the conditions \nthat prevail in the local and regional markets.\n3.37  Prequalified suppliers and contractors. Using lists of prequalified \nsuppliers and contractors to whom periodic invitations are issued can also help \naccelerate the procurement process. Prequalification documents may use a \nsimplified format that is acceptable to ADB. Suppliers and contractors are then \nasked to provide quotations for simple, common items such as commodities. \nContracts should be awarded on a competitive basis, and may be for multiyear \ndurations, with provisions on price escalation whenever justified, and the possibility \nof extension upon mutual agreement between the client and the supplier or \ncontractor.\n3.38  Community participation. The active participation of local communities \nin disaster, emergency, post-disaster, or post-conflict situations, in the identification \nand design of immediate relief efforts will ensure that their most urgent needs will \nbe met. Their contribution to the oversight of procurement or to the execution \nof works contracts, and their own implementation of small works and related \nremuneration through various means, either in-kind or through cash transfers, can \nengage the communities onto the path of faster recovery and actively contribute to \nthe immediate improvement of their living conditions.\n3.39  Force account. In FCAS and emergencies, including in small-state \nsituations, when construction firms are unlikely to bid at reasonable prices \nbecause of the location of and risks associated with the project, or when a \ncertain government agency has the sole right to operate in certain sectors (e.g., \nrailway works, high tension transmission cables, etc.), force account for repair \nor reconstruction using the borrower\u2019s own personnel and equipment, or a \ngovernment-owned construction unit, may be the only practical method (para. \n2.19 of the procurement regulations). This assumes that the borrower has sufficient \nmanagerial capacity and possesses the required technical and financial controls to \nreport to ADB on expenditures.\n3.40  Use of secondhand goods. In FCAS and emergencies, in exceptional \ncircumstances, ADB may finance the procurement of secondhand goods (e.g., \ncapital plant and equipment, vessels, vehicles, etc.), when they are considered to \nprovide the most economical and efficient means of satisfying the objectives of the \nproject. \n3.41  A procurement package for goods shall not mix secondhand goods \nwith new goods. The technical requirements/specifications should describe the \nminimum characteristics of the items that could be offered secondhand, i.e., age \nand condition (e.g., refurbished, like new, or showing normal wear and tear). ", "16 Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n3.42  Simplified bidding documents should set out (i) clear specifications \nthat provide acceptable standards, (ii) performance requirements of the goods to \nbe procured, (iii) clear criteria on how bids will be evaluated, and (iv) inspection \nrequirements and requirements for assessment and certification of the residual life \nof the goods by recognized licensed entities. \n3.43  The warranty and defect liability provisions in the contract shall be written \nor adapted to apply to secondhand goods. Any risk mitigation measure that may \nbe necessary in relation to the procurement and use of secondhand goods must be \nreflected in the procurement plan.\n3.44  Commodities. In FCAS, the most efficient way of procuring commodities \nsuch as seeds, grain, cereals, cooking oil, and fertilizers may be through specialized \nagencies, such as the UN or others, or directly from the private sector. In countries \nwhere customs duties for emergency commodities are abnormally high, the \nborrower may be asked to waive or to reduce customs duties to bring them to a \nreasonable level (e.g., 10% to 12%).15 In emergency situations, priority commodities \nmust be determined in response to the basic needs resulting from the event, \nin particular, the needs of the poorest people. Pre-shipment inspection for \ncommodities is normally required.\n3.45  Accelerated bid or proposal preparation times. Bid or proposal \npreparation periods during the immediate response and recovery phases of an \nemergency may be reduced to 15 working days for international competition and \n7\u00a0working days for national competition. Shorter periods must be approved by ADB, \ntaking into consideration the capacity of firms (local and international) to prepare \nresponsive bids within a short period.\n3.46  Bid security and performance security requirements. For small \ncontracts for goods or works, the preparation of bids by small and medium-sized \nsuppliers or contractors can be accelerated by not requiring a bid security (set \nout in Appendix 3, para. 27 of the 2017 procurement regulations). Instead, the \nborrower may require bidders to sign a declaration (set out in Appendix 3, para. 28 \nof the procurement regulations) accepting that, if they withdraw or modify their \nbid during the period of validity or when they are awarded the contract, or if they \nfail to sign the contract or to submit a performance security before the deadline \ndefined in the bidding documents, the bidder will be suspended from bidding for \nany contract with the entity that invited bids, for the period of time specified in the \nbidding document. Similarly, in the case of small contracts for works or supply of \ngoods, the borrower may decide to not require a performance security. However, in \nworks contracts, the borrower may retain the retention money during the defects \nliability period, and in contracts for goods, will request the manufacturer warranties.\n15  For example, if customs duties for the imports of nutritional commodities in a particular \ncountry were set at 90%, quick-disbursing funds to finance nutritional commodities should be \nconditional on the temporary waiver or reduction of customs duties that have negative effects \non the poorest people.", "Procurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations 17\n3.47  Advance payment. Where it is not easy for contractors, suppliers, or \nservice providers to obtain lines of credit from banks, the borrower may consider \nincreasing the amount of advance payment under works or supply contracts, \nprovided that the contractor, supplier, or service provider provides a bank guarantee \nfor the same amount. In some environments, the only contractors, suppliers, or \nservice providers willing to execute a contract may not be able to obtain bank \nguarantees for the advance payment. In such cases, the borrower must provide \na situational analysis and provide options along with appropriate risk mitigation \nmeasures. For example, contracts with CSOs, NGOs, and other institutions with \ntrack records of good performance may be offered the payment of an appropriate \namount of advance without being required to provide a bank guarantee.\n3.48  Fiduciary oversight. In general, in rapid response situations, there is \nan increased risk of fraud and corruption, particularly in the use of simplified \nprocurement procedures, less complex due diligence, false delivery certification, \ninflated invoices, theft of goods or commodities, and poor quality of materials and \nservices procured or delivered for the project. The capacity of national institutions \nin these circumstances is often weak and post-conflict political economies are \noften prone to corruption; thus, contractual terms and conditions may not be \nobserved or applied. Mitigating such risks normally includes oversight by ADB in \nclose coordination with the borrower\u2019s oversight agencies, to ensure appropriate \nscope, design, speed, supervision, and controls of the operations. Project teams \ninvolved in the preparation of FCAS operations may consider using some of the \nfollowing measures:\n(i)  Consider involving an external consultant, (e.g., private sector \nfirm, procurement agent, CSO, NGO, UN agency) as management \nconsultant to the borrower to assist with the selection, contract \nnegotiations, and contract management of suppliers, contractors, and \nconsultants in situations where the possibility of corruption is high.\n(ii)  Take a sequenced approach in emergency programs that allows \nlow-risk components and activities to move ahead, while necessary \nassessments are done for activities that represent higher risks.\n(iii)  Lower post review (sampling) thresholds for small states. \nDepending on the risk assessment of the executing agency, the \nreliability of the project management entity, and the particular risks \nassociated with the capacity of the borrower in a small state, ADB \nmay consider applying lower post review (sampling) thresholds \nthan those normally applied to projects in the same sector in other \ncountries.\n(iv)  No prior review requirement in the immediate response and \nrecovery phases of emergency and conflict situations. In such \ncases, ADB oversight is done through post review (sampling), project \nmonitoring missions, or even independent procurement review.", "18 Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n(v)  Use a monitoring and/or procurement agent, who will provide \nfiduciary assurance to ADB and the borrower by prescreening \nprocurement documents and the award of major contracts, and will \nbring issues of concern to the attention of ADB and the borrower \nfor quick resolution. Procurement agents may also be given the \nresponsibility to handle procurement on the borrower\u2019s behalf, in \naccordance with the procurement procedures set out in the loan \nagreement and elaborated in the procurement plan approved \nby\u00a0ADB.\n(vi)  Use information technology, such as smartphones, geotagging, and \nsatellite imagery for verification in hard-to-reach sites.\n(vii)  Provide for pre-shipment inspection and local independent \nverification at delivery, to ensure the qualitative and quantitative \ncompliance of the execution of contracts for goods. When a \nprocurement agent is hired to support the borrower, the related terms \nof reference may include management of inspection and acceptance \nof delivery.\n(viii) Intensify ADB supervision to address and mitigate the increased \nrisks associated with emergency operations. This may be \naccomplished by more frequent monitoring missions involving a \nprocurement specialist and/or constant supervision by ADB staff \nin-country. \n3.49  Specialist procurement support. Recognizing that procurement support \nto an operation in FCAS and emergencies will expectedly be more demanding, \nadditional support can be sought from ADB procurement staff based at the ADB \nresident mission in the region, if there is one, or based at ADB headquarters.", "Appendix: Flexibility Measures Available \nin Fragile, Conflict-Affected,  \nand emergency situations\nOperation Situation\nRecovery, Reconstruction,  \nMeasure Emergency Response Post-Conflict, or Fragile Situation\nFlexibility on  May be waived  Regional experts used as \nEligibility:  With approval from ADB\u2019s Board  \u201cnational\u201d experts\nCountry of Origin of Directors Where local capacity is poor or \ninsufficient\nSpecial  Yes  Yes \nProcurement  Simplified procurement  Simplified procurement \nArrangements arrangements allowed, including  arrangements allowed, including \ncommunity participation and the  the use of the borrower\u2019s national \nuse of the borrower\u2019s national  procurement procedures \nprocurement procedures  acceptable to ADB\nacceptable to ADB\nPAM and  Use Simplified Template  In accordance with normal \nProcurement Plan Completion of PAM and full  practices\nprocurement plan may be deferred \nto project implementation\nRisk Assessment Quick and simple Country-level risk assessment can \nbe regional\nAllowance for Yes  Yes \nSplit Packaging To broaden pool of qualified local  To broaden pool of qualified local \ncontractors or suppliers contractors or suppliers\nADB Processing  Yes  Yes \nof Start-Up  Upon written request from  Upon written request from \nActivities   borrower borrower\n(Consulting \nServices)\nIncreased  Yes  No\nApproval  Granted by the Director \nThreshold for  General, Procurement, Portfolio \nProcurement  and Financial Management \nStaff Department\nFlexibility in  Normally no prior review Based on local conditions\nReview \nThresholds\ncontinued on next page", "20 Appendix \nTable continued\nOperation Situation\nRecovery, Reconstruction,  \nMeasure Emergency Response Post-Conflict, or Fragile Situation\nFlexible Use of  Yes, as appropriate  In accordance with normal \nDirect Selection Normally without prior review practices\nUse of   Yes, encouraged Yes, encouraged\nFramework \nAgreements \nUse of Other  Yes Yes\nEntities to  e.g., entities with operations in  Especially entities familiar with the \nSupport  the area, CSOs and NGOs, UN  context or country, \nImplementation agencies CSOs and NGOs, UN agencies, \ncommunity participation\nConsultants (firms or individuals) \nto support implementation\nUse of  Yes  Yes\nProcurement  Especially when large-volume  Especially when large or complex \nAgents, Including  procurement involved works involved\nContract \nManagement \nSupport\nUse of  Yes  In accordance with normal \nForce Account Especially when government has  practices\nonsite resources\nUse of Request  Yes  In accordance with normal \nfor Quotations  Without pre-imposed ceiling,  practices\n(Shopping) adapted to circumstances\nProcurement  Yes In accordance with normal \nof Secondhand  practices\nGoods, Leasing, \nand Renting\nEnhanced Use of  Yes, given the urgency In accordance with local conditions\nLocal Advertising \nFlexible Time for   Expected to be shortened In accordance with normal \nBid or Proposal  practices\nPreparation\nLower Bidder   Yes Yes\nQualification \nRequirements\nBid Security Not mandatory  Not mandatory\nUse of bid securing declaration  Use of bid securing declaration \nacceptable acceptable\ncontinued on next page", "Appendix 21\nTable continued\nOperation Situation\nRecovery, Reconstruction,  \nMeasure Emergency Response Post-Conflict, or Fragile Situation\nWaiver of  Yes  Yes\nPerformance  For goods and small works  For goods and small works\nSecurity\nIncrease in  Can be increased Can be increased\nAmount of  \nAdvance Payment\nWaiver of  Yes No\nAdvance Payment  For low-value contracts and \nSecurity contracts with reputable \ncontractors or suppliers\nUse of Alternative  Yes Yes\nForms of  Increased use of lump sum  Encouraged\nContracting and output-based contracts is \nrecommended.
