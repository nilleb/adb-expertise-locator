These replace the former Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The procurement policy and the \nprocurement regulations address the procurement activities of project executing \nagencies and implementing agencies on projects financed in whole or in part by a \nloan or grant from ADB, or by ADB-administered funds. ADB designed the 2017 \nprocurement policy to deliver significant benefits and flexibility throughout the \nproject procurement cycle, as well as to improve project delivery through a renewed \nfocus on the concepts of quality, value for money (VFM), and fitness for purpose.\n\nThis note is part of a series of guidance notes published by ADB in 2018 to \naccompany the 2017 procurement policy and the procurement regulations. \nEach\u00a0note discusses a topical issue for borrowers (including grant recipients), \nbidders, and civil society under the new framework (see list below). The guidance \nnotes cross-reference each other frequently and should be read in conjunction. \nAll\u00a0references to \u201cguidance notes\u201d pertain to these notes.

VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\n\nt r a n sparency\n\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\n\nefficiency\n\nQuality\n\nFlexibility\n\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction \n\n\u2022\tContract management \n\n\u2022\tOpen competitive \n\ncosts\n\nsupport\n\n\u2022\tIncreased skills\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level \ntechnology usage\n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tPrompt resolution of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved developing \n\nmember country \nprocurement process \n\n\u2022\tSupport and \n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nencouragement \nof e-procurement \nsystems\n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tGovernance\n\u2022\tContracts with clear \nperformance criteria\n\u2022\tMinimal number of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved ADB \n\nprocesses \n\nFairnes s\n\nbidding\n\n\u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tAccreditation \nfor alternative \nprocurement \narrangements\n\u2022\tPrinciples-based \n\ndecisions\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tBids with weighted  \n\nproposal  \ncriteria \n\ntime\n\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \n\nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.\n\n\fAbout This Publication\n\nvii\n\nobjective\n\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \n\nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \n\nLiving Document\n\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nthe reader \n\nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs.

Therefore, this guidance note offers procurement practitioners \non projects financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan or grant, or by ADB-\nadministered funds, practical measures to enable them to adapt procurement \nrequirements in FCAS and emergencies in response to different situations. \n\nSome of these measures include:\n\nAt the project design and procurement planning stage:\n\n\u2022\t\n\nIncreased flexibility in the design of procurement arrangements, with more \nflexible packaging arrangements and use of national procedures,\n\u2022\t Allowance for the initiation of projects before the completion of full \n\nprocurement planning,\nIncreased flexibility in the use of open competitive bidding with national \nadvertising,\nIncreased flexibility of prior and post review (sampling) practices, and\nIncreased flexibility in the use of direct selection, particularly in emergency \nsituations.\n\nIn the processing of procurement transactions:\n\n\u2022\t Use of procurement agents or other entities to support implementation,\n\u2022\t Availability of ADB support to assist with start-up processing of consultant \n\nselection,\nFlexibility to expand or adjust existing contracts rather than create new ones,\nLower minimum bidder qualification requirements,\nLower performance security or advance payment security requirements, and\nIncreased allowance for advance payments.\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\n\f\fi.\u2003introduction\n\nOperating in countries experiencing fragility, with weak institutions, \n\n1.1 \nor emerging from conflict, or confronted with an emergency situation, carries a \nnumber of challenges for both the public institutions involved in the design and \nimplementation of projects as much as for funders such as the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).\n\nWhile ADB has long had procedures in place to process emergency \n\n1.2 \nassistance loans in an expedited manner, further progress was needed to expedite \nprocurement in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS) or in emergency \nsituations, in which there is a need to accommodate the challenging local realities. \nADB\u2019s Procurement Policy: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as \namended from time to time) address these issues and allow greater differentiation \nin procurement to respond to country conditions, on projects financed in whole or \nin part by an ADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds.\n\nThis guidance note1 elaborates on the section on Procurement in Fragile \n\n1.3 \nand Conflict-Affected Situations in the procurement regulations (para. 2.23). \nIts\u00a0purpose is not to provide a step-by-step \u201chow-to\u201d guide to processing any \nand all procurement transactions under projects in either FCAS or emergency \nsituations. By definition, there is no single solution that will successfully address all \nthe different circumstances in any given context. \n\nRather, the guidance note proposes measures that can facilitate \n\n1.4 \nprocurement in such situations, and borrowers (including grant recipients) are \nstrongly encouraged to work closely with the assigned ADB project team and \nprocurement specialist to discuss these specific flexibilities and options, as well as \nany other measures that the situation warrants. \n\n1 \n\nIn the spirit of harmonization, this guidance note draws extensively from: World Bank. 2016. \nBank Guidance: Procurement in Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity Constraints. \nWashington, DC.

Similarly, in emergency situations, \nADB\u2019s internal regulations on its lending and grant operations allow projects to \nbenefit from the provisions on disaster and emergency assistance outlined in the \nADB Operations Manual.2 Notably,\n\n(i) \n\nthe normal stages of identification, preparation, and appraisal may be \ncondensed;\n\n(ii)  the decision to authorize negotiations may be taken after a simplified \n\nreview of a project\u2019s documentation; and\n\n(iii)  turnaround times at key stages of processing may be reduced. \n\nThe design of an FCAS or emergency project must reflect the specifics of \n\n2.2 \nthe borrower\u2019s situation as well as the related constraints and risks, to ensure that \nthe project adequately responds to the borrower\u2019s needs and that it can achieve its \nintended results efficiently and with value for money.\n\nFurthermore, borrowers and ADB project teams must ensure that they \n\n2.3 \n\u201cdo no harm\u201d and that they develop and implement plans to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate, or compensate for the potential adverse impacts of assistance projects.3\n\nB. \n\nDefinitions\n\nADB identifies fragile or conflict-affected countries as those of \n\n2.4 \nits developing member countries with weak governance, ineffective public \nadministration and rule of law, and civil unrest.4 It distinguishes between fragility \nand conflict-affected:\n\n2  ADB. 2015.

Although it may provide \nan opportunity for change, if not managed correctly and peacefully, \nit can escalate into violence.6 Conflict can be a cause, symptom, or \nconsequence of fragility. Regardless, a lack of state responsiveness \nmay raise the risk of conflict and the possibility of violence \n(footnote\u00a05).\n\n(iii)  On the other hand, a post-conflict country is one emerging from a \n\nviolent, protracted conflict (footnote 2). \n\nFCAS are generally characterized by political instability, weak governance \n\n2.5 \nand institutional capacity, economic and social insecurity, high levels of poverty, \nwide gaps in the level of social and economic services, lack of competition, disputes \nover access to resources and the sharing of their profits, and greater vulnerability to \nthe effects of natural hazards and climate change. Public service delivery systems \nseldom function well, and the ability of the government to guarantee the basic \nsecurity of its people is often limited.7 Figure 2 describes how situations may exist \nalong a continuum of fragility and conflict, versus resilience and stability.\n\n2.6 \n\nADB identifies disasters and emergency situations (footnote 2) as follows:\n\n(i)  Disaster means a sudden, calamitous event that seriously disrupts \nthe functioning of a community or society, causing widespread \nhuman, material, economic, or environmental losses that exceed \nthe community\u2019s or society\u2019s ability to cope using its own resources. \nDisasters can be caused by natural events,8 technological or industrial \naccidents,9 or conflict.10 \n\n(ii)  An emergency occurs after a natural or anthropogenic disaster, or \n\nconflict, when unforeseen circumstances require immediate action, \nand local capacity is insufficient to address and manage traumatic \n\n5  See ADB. 2012.

The strategy \nshould provide critical policy recommendations for the response to immediate \npriorities along with accompanying long-term actions.\n\n3.2 \nProcurement risk assessments are a key instrument used in the \npreparation of a project strategy. From the country and sector/agency procurement \nrisk assessments that feed into the country partnership strategy, to the project-level \nprocurement risk assessment prepared at the project design stage, all are meant \nto inform the project strategy and reflect the specific circumstances of a country, \nsector, or procuring entity that would affect project implementation. The measures \nof flexibility in procurement discussed in this guidance note are intended to \naddress some of the risks identified in these assessments. See the Guidance Note on \nProcurement Risk Framework for further details on procurement risk assessments.\n\n3.3 \nWhile ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) allows flexibility in \nprocessing FCAS projects and emergency assistance, the initial environmental \nexamination, environmental impact assessment, resettlement plan, and/or \nindigenous people\u2019s plan prepared based on the approved frameworks must be \nformulated and approved by ADB before any project-related physical activity starts.\n\n3.4 \nwell as medium-term objectives. These may include \n\nThe project strategy identifies immediate priority assistance objectives as \n\n(i)  a proposal for technical assistance and other forms of investment \n\nrequired to meet the stated objectives; \n\n(ii)  an assessment of potential impediments to rapid disbursement, \n\nincluding associated fiduciary risks and proposed mitigation measures; \n\n(iii)  identification of the exceptional measures required to undertake \n\nrehabilitation or reconstruction works; \n\n(iv)  an assessment of risks, risk mitigation strategies, and contingency \n\nresponses; and\n\n(v)  benchmarks and performance monitoring indicators. \n\n\fProcurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\n7\n\nThe project implementation arrangements detail the circumstances \n\n3.5 \nconsidered in the preparation of the procurement plan, and include a description \nof procurement processing, procurement risks, and selection methods. The \nproject\u2019s procurement plan must be updated regularly (e.g., on each review mission \nconducted by the project team), and review mission reports should include a \njustification for changes to the procurement plan. See the Guidance Note on Strategic \nProcurement Planning for further details on the procurement planning process.\n\n3.6 \nprojects in FCAS and emergency situations are the following:\n\nSome of the things to keep in mind during the design and preparation for \n\n(i)  Keep the design of the project administration manual (PAM) and \n\nthe related procurement plan and packaging short, simple, and fit for \npurpose.\n\n(ii)  Understand the prevailing political economy, cultural sensitivities, and \nthe severity and geographic spread of any conflict that may affect the \ncountry.\n\n(iii)  Understand the supply chain limitations (access to imports, primary \ninputs, labor, electricity, water supply, banking services, etc.) and \nconstraints to communications, transport, and other logistical factors \naffecting the country.\n\n(iv)  Assess labor risks and other key social factors, including child labor \nconditions, and ensure that workers are neither trafficked nor \nworking under forced labor, especially under rapid procurement and \ncontracting.\n\n(v)  Use procurement and selection methods that suit the situation and \n\nthat will deliver the best outcomes.\n\n(vi)  Consider adaptable project controls, such as levels of prior and post \nreview (sampling), which can be adjusted as capacity improves.\n\n(vii)  Consider using framework agreements where feasible.\n(viii)  Consider the need to supplement the capacity of the executing \n\nagency in managing and administering contracts, e.g., with consultant \nsupport.\n\n(ix)  Consider relying on other institutions with operations in the \n\ncountry, such as United Nations (UN) agencies, other multilateral \ndevelopment banks, donors, civil society organizations (CSOs), etc.\n\n(x)  Enable communities to participate in the design and subsequent \n\nimplementation of works. \n\nB.  \n\nProcurement Preparedness\n\nProcurement is an essential component of emergency, conflict, and disaster \n\n3.7 \npreparedness and response. Various measures can be taken before an emergency, \nconflict, or disaster occurs to optimize the capacity of procurement systems to \nrespond effectively to the situation. The measures outlined below are essential to \naddress the challenges to procurement preparedness in any such situation.\n\n\f8\n\nFragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\nEmergency procurement preparedness involves actions taken in advance \n\n3.8 \nof an emergency that will enhance the capacity of authorities to address the \nsituation. The list of actions that follows, grouped into four categories, is not \nexhaustive, but gives an idea of the considerations involved:\n\n(i)  Legal and Institutional Infrastructure for Emergency Response\n\n(a)  Integration of procurement into national disaster preparedness \n\nand risk reduction plans\n\n(b)  Establishment of a governance structure and legal framework that \n\ngoverns the application of emergency procedures\n\n(c)  Setting up of emergency procurement teams, pooling the most \n\nskilled experts\n\nteams \n\n(d)  Setting up of emergency contract or supply chain management \n\n(e)  Capacity building for undertaking emergency procurement, \nincluding due diligence checks in preselecting contractors, \nsuppliers, and consultants \n\n(f)  Use of framework agreements for faster deployment of resources \n\n(ii)  Allocation of Resources for Emergency Procurement Facilities \n\nand\u00a0Teams\n(a)  Office space\n(b)  Communications and connectivity equipment\n(c)  Storage and distribution facilities\n(d)  Transportation resources, including local firms for in-country \n\ntransportation of people and cargo\n\n(e)  Publicly-accessible free website to ensure wide dissemination of \n\ninformation\n\n(f)  Reserve budget for the work of the emergency procurement team \n\n(iii)  Development of Emergency Procurement Procedures and Tools\n\n(a)  Legal framework that authorizes and specifies special procedures \nfor emergency situations (e.g., use of direct selection, force \naccount, framework agreements, etc.)\n\n(b)  Use of electronic procurement and related processes\n(c)  Adapted prequalification procedures\n(d)  Standard emergency forms of contracts, requisition forms, and \n\nreporting formats\n\n(e)  Principles and procedures applicable to cost reimbursements\n(f)  Asset tracking procedures \n\n\fProcurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\n9\n\n(iv)  Readiness for Contractor and Supplier Mobilization\n\n(a)  Identification of frequently required emergency goods and \nservices, related suppliers, and estimated costs (e.g., for \ntemporary shelter, water, food/nutritional supplements, \ncommunication equipment, vehicles, medical supplies, etc.)\n(b)  Establishment and periodic updating of a list of prequalified \n\nsuppliers, contractors, and service providers\n\n(c)  Assessment of countrywide (as well as region-wide, where \nrelevant) markets for common supplies needed in case of \nemergency\n\n(d)  Framework agreements for consulting services, goods, supplies, \n\nand works developed and used for emergency situations\n(e)  Prepositioning of supplies and establishment of linkages with \n\nother humanitarian organizations\u2019 depots\n\n(f)  Standby contracts with prequalified suppliers, contractors, and \n\nservice providers\n\nC.  \n\nSituational Response\n\nThe ADB Operations Manual, Disaster and Emergency Assistance section \n\n3.9 \n(footnote 2) allows for a broad spectrum of response measures in emergency \nsituations, in terms of financing and simplified procedures for project processing \nand implementation.\n\n3.10 \nFor FCAS and emergencies, ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement regulations also \nallow for greater flexibility in designing and conducting procurement. Below is a \nlist of measures that can be adopted in consultation with borrowers and other \ndevelopment partners:\n\n(i)  Fiduciary arrangements normally required during the preparation \n\nperiod may be deferred to the implementation stage. For example, the \nfinalization of the PAM may be postponed and the procurement plan \npushed back to after project start-up, and a simplified PAM and initial \nprocurement plan may be used in project processing documents.\n\n(ii)  Procurement may be conducted using the borrower\u2019s national \n\nprocurement arrangements, provided that these are acceptable to \nADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s core procurement principles.\n(iii)  Where no viable implementation capacity or alternative exists, ADB \nmay, at the request of the borrower, execute start-up activities on \nbehalf of the borrower. For example, under a loan or grant project, \nADB may select the project implementation support consultant \nwho will assist the borrower with the implementation of the project, \nincluding in the conduct of further procurement activities.\n\n(iv)  The Director General of ADB\u2019s Procurement, Portfolio and Financial \nManagement Department may provisionally increase the delegation \nthresholds granted to procurement staff so they are fully empowered \nto act and provide clearances in a timely manner. \n\n\f10\n\nFragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\nThe Appendix lists measures that may, at the request of the borrower, \n\n3.11 \nbe considered and put into place to answer the particular challenges of FCAS and \nemergencies.\n\nD.   Application of ADB Regulations and Procedures \n\nduring Emergencies\n\nDuring the immediate response and recovery phase of an emergency \n\n3.12 \nor conflict, ADB may accept the use of the borrower\u2019s national procurement \narrangements, provided that these procedures are consistent with ADB\u2019s core \nprocurement principles and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) and Integrity Principles and Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto\u00a0time). \n\nNormally, ADB\u2019s prior review will not be required during the immediate \n\n3.13 \nresponse phase of an emergency, since available time is limited. Prior review should \nonly be used in exceptional cases and responses will be provided promptly. ADB\u2019s \noversight of procurement may be enhanced through increased implementation \nsupport and/or increased post review (sampling).\n\nE.   Operational Context and Market Conditions\n\nThe supply market and local market conditions should be assessed \n3.14 \nperiodically. Refer to the Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning for \nfurther details.\n\nAlthough periodic market assessments may be undertaken for FCAS \n\n3.15 \ncountries, it may be necessary to conduct an update of local conditions, especially \nin the aftermath of an emergency event. This can be achieved quickly through \ninformal, ad hoc surveys and by involving local authorities, communities, workers, \nworkers\u2019 representatives, CSOs, groups of people with disabilities, and businesses in \nthe affected areas. ADB resident missions could also assist in this exercise.\n\nIn addition to market assessments, the following aspects may also \n\n3.16 \nbe considered when preparing the procurement plan of projects in FCAS and \nemergency situations.\n\n1. \n\nsecurity requirements in the Country\n\n3.17 \nEach country will present different security issues that have an impact on \nprocurement processes and the performance of contracts. Security considerations \nare often reflected in the prices quoted for goods, works, and services. To ensure \ngreater transparency and more realistic pricing, the cost of security should \nbe identified as a separate line item in contracts to facilitate and manage the \nimpact on cost if the security situation in the country changes during contract \nimplementation.\n\n\fProcurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\n11\n\n2. \n\nContracting Core government services to external Providers\n\nContracting core government services to external providers may be an \n\n3.18 \noption when local government is recovering from conflict and, as a result, has \nlittle or no capacity to deliver essential public services or functions, e.g., on public \nfinancial management, legislative drafting, treasury reform, management of health \nservices, private sector development, management of state-owned enterprises, etc. \n\nThe contracting out of these services is a possible short-term solution; \n\n3.19 \nhowever, there are potential political and technical risks associated with this \napproach that need to be considered at the project appraisal stage. Contracting for \nthese services should be subject to appropriate procurement procedures to ensure \nthat quality services are contracted.\n\n3. \n\ngovernance\n\nThere is an inherently high risk that procurement in FCAS and emergency \n\n3.20 \noperations could be affected by conflicts of interest or by fraudulent or corrupt \nactivities of some of the stakeholders involved in the procurement process. Also, \nthe likelihood of complications, cost overruns, delays, and poor quality of goods and \nservices may be very high due to capacity constraints, urgency, and general disorder. \n\nDeveloping a sound governance and anticorruption plan for the project \n\n3.21 \nis a key consideration to help mitigate those risks. In small states, conflict of \ninterest is often an issue and appropriate mitigation measures must be designed to \naddress such situations. Results of project procurement-related reviews (PPRRs) \nconducted by ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) in FCAS \ncountries should be considered in identifying and assessing these integrity risks.12 \nIn the event that integrity concerns are identified, the project team should consult \nOAI13 to help assess and determine if these integrity risks are deemed significant.\n\nF.  \n\nOrganizational and Institutional Support\n\nAny development assistance project must be supported by sufficient \n\n3.22 \nattention to the borrower\u2019s organizational and institutional arrangements for \nimplementation, including for procurement. Measures that can be considered for \nFCAS and emergencies include the following:\n\n12  PPRRs assess project integrity risks by identifying signs of integrity violations through \n\n(i)\u00a0examination of processes, procedures, and documentation related to procurement,  \nfinancial management, and contract management; and (ii) inspection of project outputs.  \nOAI recommends enhancements to mitigate or eliminate opportunities for integrity violations.  \nAs\u00a0of 2018, OAI has conducted PPRRs in four FCAS countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar,  \nPapua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste.\n\n13  OAI may be reached through e-mail: integrity@adb.org.\n\n\f12\n\nFragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\n(i)  Within the country. Rapid and appropriate assistance requires ADB \nto work in a flexible and pragmatic way with other institutions.\n(a)  In countries with weak implementation capacity, ADB may \nconsider a request from the borrower to contract other \ninstitutions such as nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and \nCSOs, UN agencies, or other multilateral or bilateral institutions \nto undertake all or part of project implementation, including the \nprocurement functions.\n\n(b)  Use of the alternative procurement arrangements of another \nmultilateral or bilateral agency or organization involved in \nthe project, or accredited agency of the borrower, should be \nconsidered during project design in accordance with section XII \nof the 2017 procurement policy. In such cases, ADB may agree \nto rely on and apply the procurement rules and procedures of \nthe agency or organization and may agree to such party taking a \nlead role in providing implementation support and monitoring of \nprocurement activities. \n\n(ii)  Within ADB. ADB procedures and regulations provide several options \nthat support the timely processing of transactions in particularly \nurgent or compelling circumstances. For example, in FCAS and \nemergencies, ADB may provide direct assistance to the borrower by:\n(a)  financing individual consultants to support the borrower in \n\nproject implementation, including procurement;\n\n(b)  drafting procurement documents;\n(c)  handling the selection of consultants on behalf of the borrower;\n(d)  assisting in the identification of strengths and weaknesses in bids \n\nor proposals; and\n\n(e)  acting as observer in contract negotiations or in dialogues \nbetween the borrower and its consultants, contractors, or \nsuppliers. \n\nIn any event, the ultimate responsibility for procurement remains with \n\n3.23 \nthe borrower, and direct assistance by ADB must never result in ADB entering into \ncontracts on behalf of the borrower.\n\nG.   Use of Procurement Agents\n\n3.24  When the borrower does not have the required in-house capacity for the \nnecessary procurement or project management activities, hiring a procurement \nagent or project management consultant may be the most efficient option. The \nprocurement agent should be selected in accordance with para. 2.24 of the 2017 \nprocurement regulations.\n\n\fProcurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\n13\n\nH.  \n\nFlexible Arrangements for Procurement\n\nIn FCAS and emergencies, the selection methods, selection arrangements, \n\n3.25 \nand market approaches used to procure goods, works, and services should be \nsimplified, consistent with the provisions of the 2017 procurement regulations. \nBelow are some measures for consideration.\n\n1. \n\nApproach to National versus International Markets \n\nBidding procedures targeting the national market using the borrower\u2019s \n\n3.26 \nown procurement rules and procedures may be used when the procedures for \ninternational advertising are considered inappropriate or too complex due to the \nborrower\u2019s weak implementation capacity, where there is clearly no international \nmarket appetite to participate in the procurement process, or when speed is of the \nessence.\n\n2. \n\nFlexible Arrangements for the Selection of Consultants\n\nDirect selection. Direct selection of consulting firms and individuals \n\n3.27 \n(paras. 2.17 and 2.18 of the procurement regulations) should be used if it presents \na clear advantage over competition for the required consulting services. Firms \nthat are already working in the country and have a proven track record in similar \nassignments may be the most suitable option for start-up activities. Consultants \nselected on a direct selection basis may be given the opportunity to participate in \nfuture assignments under the same project, provided there is no unresolved conflict \nof interest with the tasks performed under the initial contract. \n\nFramework agreements, as described in paras. 2.8 and 2.9 of the \n\n3.28 \nprocurement regulations, may be appropriate for the procurement of consulting \nservices in emergency situations or for crisis planning, such as for natural disasters. \nSuch framework agreements may be existing borrower agreements to be used in \nADB operations, or they may be established by the borrower specifically for the \nADB project.14\n\n3.29 \nUsing a \u201cpool of experts\u201d or a list of \u201cpreselected\u201d consulting firms or \nindividual experts may also be considered appropriate to support borrowers at \nvarious steps of project implementation, including procurement processing as well \nas preparation of terms of reference, shortlists, and requests for proposals. \n\n3. \n\nFlexible Arrangements for Procurement of Goods, Works, \nand\u00a0Nonconsulting Services\n\n3.30 \nDirect selection. Direct selection for contracts for goods, works, and \nnonconsulting services may be used to extend an existing contract or to award \nnew contracts in response to disasters or emergencies. For such contracting to \n\n14  For further details, refer to the Guidance Note on Framework Agreements for Consulting Services.\n\n\f14\n\nFragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\nbe justified, ADB should be satisfied that the price is reasonable and that no \nsignificant benefit could be derived from further competition. Contractors and \nsuppliers selected under projects financed by other development partners may \nalso be considered for direct selection under an ADB-financed emergency project. \nThe\u00a0direct selection may be from the private sector, UN agencies, suppliers, \ncontractors, or NGOs that are already mobilized and working in the emergency \nareas.\n\n3.31 \nFramework agreements may be appropriate for the procurement of \ngoods, works, and services in emergency situations or for crisis planning (such \nas for natural disasters). Such framework agreements may be existing borrower \nagreements to be used in ADB operations, or they may be established by the \nborrower specifically for the ADB project.\n\n3.32 \nRequest for quotations. Request for quotations (RFQ) (paras. 2.10\u20132.13 \nof the procurement regulations) is a competitive method based on comparison of \nprices obtained from firms for the provision of goods, works, or services that are \ngenerally of low value, low risk, not complex, and can be specified through simple \nrequirements. This method may be appropriate to procure limited quantities \nof readily available, off-the-shelf goods or services, standard specification \ncommodities, or simple civil works of small value, when it is more efficient than \nusing more competitive methods of procurement. \n\nQuotations should be obtained through advertisement, or when limited \n\n3.33 \ncompetition is justified, through an RFQ to a limited number of firms. To ensure \ncompetition, the borrower should request quotations from as many firms as \npossible to allow comparison of normally at least three responsive quotations. In \nsituations where less than three suppliers or contractors are available (or when \nless than three responsive quotations are received), the borrower should note the \nsituation in the procurement records and proceed with the award of contract. There \nis no requirement for the borrower to obtain a no-objection from ADB when there \nare fewer than three quotations; however, those RFQ contracts may be prioritized \nfor ADB\u2019s post review (sampling). \n\n3.34 \nFirms must be given sufficient time to prepare and submit their \nquotations. RFQs must include the description and quantity for the works, goods, \nor services, including any installation requirements as appropriate. The request \nmust also indicate the deadline for submission of quotations and specify whether \nquotations are accepted by letter, facsimile, or other electronic means. The \nevaluation of quotations and contract award is carried out based on the criteria \nspecified in the RFQ. The terms of the accepted quotation must be incorporated \nin a contractually binding document. The borrower must keep records of all \nproceedings regarding RFQs.\n\n3.35 \nIn emergency situations, the RFQ method can also be used even \nfor higher-value contracts; the justification should be noted in the PAM or \nprocurement records as appropriate. Such contracts may be prioritized for post \nreview (sampling).\n\n\fProcurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\n15\n\n3.36 \nSimplification of pre- and post-qualification criteria. The pre- and \npost-qualification criteria should be set to optimize the participation of local or \nregional contractors and suppliers and may, therefore, be based on the conditions \nthat prevail in the local and regional markets.\n\nPrequalified suppliers and contractors. Using lists of prequalified \n\n3.37 \nsuppliers and contractors to whom periodic invitations are issued can also help \naccelerate the procurement process. Prequalification documents may use a \nsimplified format that is acceptable to ADB. Suppliers and contractors are then \nasked to provide quotations for simple, common items such as commodities. \nContracts should be awarded on a competitive basis, and may be for multiyear \ndurations, with provisions on price escalation whenever justified, and the possibility \nof extension upon mutual agreement between the client and the supplier or \ncontractor.\n\nCommunity participation. The active participation of local communities \n\n3.38 \nin disaster, emergency, post-disaster, or post-conflict situations, in the identification \nand design of immediate relief efforts will ensure that their most urgent needs will \nbe met. Their contribution to the oversight of procurement or to the execution \nof works contracts, and their own implementation of small works and related \nremuneration through various means, either in-kind or through cash transfers, can \nengage the communities onto the path of faster recovery and actively contribute to \nthe immediate improvement of their living conditions.\n\nForce account. In FCAS and emergencies, including in small-state \n\n3.39 \nsituations, when construction firms are unlikely to bid at reasonable prices \nbecause of the location of and risks associated with the project, or when a \ncertain government agency has the sole right to operate in certain sectors (e.g., \nrailway works, high tension transmission cables, etc.), force account for repair \nor reconstruction using the borrower\u2019s own personnel and equipment, or a \ngovernment-owned construction unit, may be the only practical method (para. \n2.19 of the procurement regulations). This assumes that the borrower has sufficient \nmanagerial capacity and possesses the required technical and financial controls to \nreport to ADB on expenditures.\n\n3.40 \nUse of secondhand goods. In FCAS and emergencies, in exceptional \ncircumstances, ADB may finance the procurement of secondhand goods (e.g., \ncapital plant and equipment, vessels, vehicles, etc.), when they are considered to \nprovide the most economical and efficient means of satisfying the objectives of the \nproject. \n\nA procurement package for goods shall not mix secondhand goods \n\n3.41 \nwith new goods. The technical requirements/specifications should describe the \nminimum characteristics of the items that could be offered secondhand, i.e., age \nand condition (e.g., refurbished, like new, or showing normal wear and tear). \n\n\f16\n\nFragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\nSimplified bidding documents should set out (i) clear specifications \n\n3.42 \nthat provide acceptable standards, (ii) performance requirements of the goods to \nbe procured, (iii) clear criteria on how bids will be evaluated, and (iv) inspection \nrequirements and requirements for assessment and certification of the residual life \nof the goods by recognized licensed entities. \n\nThe warranty and defect liability provisions in the contract shall be written \n\n3.43 \nor adapted to apply to secondhand goods. Any risk mitigation measure that may \nbe necessary in relation to the procurement and use of secondhand goods must be \nreflected in the procurement plan.\n\nCommodities. In FCAS, the most efficient way of procuring commodities \n3.44 \nsuch as seeds, grain, cereals, cooking oil, and fertilizers may be through specialized \nagencies, such as the UN or others, or directly from the private sector. In countries \nwhere customs duties for emergency commodities are abnormally high, the \nborrower may be asked to waive or to reduce customs duties to bring them to a \nreasonable level (e.g., 10% to 12%).15 In emergency situations, priority commodities \nmust be determined in response to the basic needs resulting from the event, \nin particular, the needs of the poorest people. Pre-shipment inspection for \ncommodities is normally required.\n\nAccelerated bid or proposal preparation times. Bid or proposal \n\n3.45 \npreparation periods during the immediate response and recovery phases of an \nemergency may be reduced to 15 working days for international competition and \n7\u00a0working days for national competition. Shorter periods must be approved by ADB, \ntaking into consideration the capacity of firms (local and international) to prepare \nresponsive bids within a short period.\n\nBid security and performance security requirements. For small \n\n3.46 \ncontracts for goods or works, the preparation of bids by small and medium-sized \nsuppliers or contractors can be accelerated by not requiring a bid security (set \nout in Appendix 3, para. 27 of the 2017 procurement regulations). Instead, the \nborrower may require bidders to sign a declaration (set out in Appendix 3, para. 28 \nof the procurement regulations) accepting that, if they withdraw or modify their \nbid during the period of validity or when they are awarded the contract, or if they \nfail to sign the contract or to submit a performance security before the deadline \ndefined in the bidding documents, the bidder will be suspended from bidding for \nany contract with the entity that invited bids, for the period of time specified in the \nbidding document. Similarly, in the case of small contracts for works or supply of \ngoods, the borrower may decide to not require a performance security. However, in \nworks contracts, the borrower may retain the retention money during the defects \nliability period, and in contracts for goods, will request the manufacturer warranties.\n\n15  For example, if customs duties for the imports of nutritional commodities in a particular \n\ncountry were set at 90%, quick-disbursing funds to finance nutritional commodities should be \nconditional on the temporary waiver or reduction of customs duties that have negative effects \non the poorest people.\n\n\fProcurement Flexibilities in Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\n17\n\nAdvance payment. Where it is not easy for contractors, suppliers, or \n\n3.47 \nservice providers to obtain lines of credit from banks, the borrower may consider \nincreasing the amount of advance payment under works or supply contracts, \nprovided that the contractor, supplier, or service provider provides a bank guarantee \nfor the same amount. In some environments, the only contractors, suppliers, or \nservice providers willing to execute a contract may not be able to obtain bank \nguarantees for the advance payment. In such cases, the borrower must provide \na situational analysis and provide options along with appropriate risk mitigation \nmeasures. For example, contracts with CSOs, NGOs, and other institutions with \ntrack records of good performance may be offered the payment of an appropriate \namount of advance without being required to provide a bank guarantee.\n\n3.48 \nFiduciary oversight. In general, in rapid response situations, there is \nan increased risk of fraud and corruption, particularly in the use of simplified \nprocurement procedures, less complex due diligence, false delivery certification, \ninflated invoices, theft of goods or commodities, and poor quality of materials and \nservices procured or delivered for the project. The capacity of national institutions \nin these circumstances is often weak and post-conflict political economies are \noften prone to corruption; thus, contractual terms and conditions may not be \nobserved or applied. Mitigating such risks normally includes oversight by ADB in \nclose coordination with the borrower\u2019s oversight agencies, to ensure appropriate \nscope, design, speed, supervision, and controls of the operations. Project teams \ninvolved in the preparation of FCAS operations may consider using some of the \nfollowing measures:\n\n(i)  Consider involving an external consultant, (e.g., private sector \n\nfirm, procurement agent, CSO, NGO, UN agency) as management \nconsultant to the borrower to assist with the selection, contract \nnegotiations, and contract management of suppliers, contractors, and \nconsultants in situations where the possibility of corruption is high.\n\n(ii)  Take a sequenced approach in emergency programs that allows \n\nlow-risk components and activities to move ahead, while necessary \nassessments are done for activities that represent higher risks.\n(iii)  Lower post review (sampling) thresholds for small states. \n\nDepending on the risk assessment of the executing agency, the \nreliability of the project management entity, and the particular risks \nassociated with the capacity of the borrower in a small state, ADB \nmay consider applying lower post review (sampling) thresholds \nthan those normally applied to projects in the same sector in other \ncountries.\n\n(iv)  No prior review requirement in the immediate response and \nrecovery phases of emergency and conflict situations. In such \ncases, ADB oversight is done through post review (sampling), project \nmonitoring missions, or even independent procurement review.\n\n\f18\n\nFragile, Conflict-Affected, and Emergency Situations\n\n(v)  Use a monitoring and/or procurement agent, who will provide \n\nfiduciary assurance to ADB and the borrower by prescreening \nprocurement documents and the award of major contracts, and will \nbring issues of concern to the attention of ADB and the borrower \nfor quick resolution. Procurement agents may also be given the \nresponsibility to handle procurement on the borrower\u2019s behalf, in \naccordance with the procurement procedures set out in the loan \nagreement and elaborated in the procurement plan approved \nby\u00a0ADB.\n\n(vi)  Use information technology, such as smartphones, geotagging, and \n\nsatellite imagery for verification in hard-to-reach sites.\n(vii)  Provide for pre-shipment inspection and local independent \n\nverification at delivery, to ensure the qualitative and quantitative \ncompliance of the execution of contracts for goods.

The nature and capacity of local industries, \nthe capacity of local public administrations, and the usual stringent requirements \nimposed on contractors, suppliers, and service providers, all require careful \nadjustments for procurement to be efficient. ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement framework \nprovides the opportunity to differentiate procurement approaches according to \ncountry conditions. Therefore, this guidance note offers procurement practitioners on \nprojects financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered \nfunds, simplified and flexible procurement measures to respond adequately to the \nchallenges of procurement in fragile, conflict-affected, and emergency situations. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank \n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the \nworld\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["FRAGILE, CONFLICT-AFFECTED, \nAND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS\nGUIDANCE NOTE ON PROCUREMENT\n", "JUNE 2018\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "   Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0  \n  IGO license (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 IGO) \n", "\u00a9 2018 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
