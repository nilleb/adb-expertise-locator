Financial inclusion is \noften  considered  as  a  critical  element  that  makes  growth  inclusive  as  access  to  finance  can  enable \neconomic agents to make longer-term consumption and investment decisions, participate in productive \nactivities,  and  cope  with  unexpected  short-term  shocks.  Understanding  the  link  between  financial \ninclusion,  poverty,  and  income  inequality  at  the  country  level  will  help  policymakers  design  and \nimplement  programs  that  will  broaden  access  to  financial  services,  leading  to  reduction  of  poverty \nincidence  and  income  equality.    This  paper  extends  the  existing  literature  on  financial  inclusion  by \nfocusing on developing Asian economies. We construct our own financial inclusion indicator to assess \nvarious  macroeconomic  and  country-specific  factors  affecting  the  degree  of  financial  inclusion  for  37 \nselected  developing  Asian  economies.  We  also  test  the  impact  of  financial  inclusion,  along  with  other \ncontrol variables, on poverty and income inequality. Our results show that per capita income, rule of law, \nand demographic characteristics significantly affect financial inclusion in developing Asia. Furthermore, \nwe  find  that  financial  inclusion  significantly  reduces  poverty;  and  there  is  also  evidence  that  it  lowers \nincome  inequality.  Our  findings  suggest  that  the  provisions  for  young  and  old-age  populations,  e.g., \nretirement pensions; and stronger rule of law, including enforcement of financial contracts and financial \nregulatory oversight, will broaden financial inclusion, thereby contributing to poverty reduction and lower \nincome inequality. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: financial inclusion, developing Asia, poverty, income inequality \n \nJEL Classification: G18, O11, O16 \n \n\n\f\u00a0\n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nOne of developing Asia\u2019s success stories is its sustained economic expansion which lifted millions out \nof  poverty.  But  poverty  remains  a  stubborn  challenge  across  the  region,  with  evidence  pointing  to \ndeteriorating  income  equality  in  recent  years.  The  challenge  for  the  region\u2019s  policymakers  is  to  the \nreach of the socioeconomic benefits associated with rapid economic expansion. Financial inclusion is \ncritical as increasing the poor\u2019s access to financial services is often considered as an effective tool that \ncan help reduce poverty and lower income inequality.  \n \n\nFinancial inclusion is a broad concept. As defined by Sarma (2008), financial inclusion is the \nprocess  that  ensures  the  ease  of  access,  availability,  and  usage  of  formal  financial  system  for  all \nmembers  of  an  economy.  However,  it  is  also  important  to  distinguish  between  voluntary  versus \ninvoluntary  exclusion.  The  World  Bank  (2014)  defines  voluntary  exclusion  as  a  condition  where  the \nsegment of the population or firms choose not to  use financial services either because they have no \nneed  for  them  or  due  to  cultural  or  religious  reasons.  In  contrast,  involuntary  exclusion  arises  from \ninsufficient income and high risk profile or due to discrimination and market failures and imperfections. \nPolicy  and  research  initiatives  must  then  focus  on  involuntary  exclusion  as  it  can  be  addressed  by \nappropriate  economic  programs  and  policies  which  can  be  designed  to  increase  income  levels  and \ncorrect market failures and imperfections. \n \n\nAlthough  financial  inclusion  has  become  topical  on  the  global  policy  agenda  for  sustainable \ndevelopment, economic literature on financial inclusion is still in its infancy. Most studies have looked \ninto the appropriate measures of financial inclusion both at household and country levels, while some \npapers focused on the role of financial access in lowering poverty and income inequality.  Other papers \nhave dealt with varying levels of financial inclusion both in advanced and emerging economies. These \npapers  have  laid  the  foundations  in  this  field  and  provide  key  policy  insights  on  the  importance  of \nfinancial inclusion on sustainable development.  However, more work needs to be done.  \n \n\nThis paper contributes to the existing literature by 1) developing a financial inclusion measure \nwhich  utilizes  available  cross-country  data,  2)  focusing  on  developing  Asian  economies,1 and  3) \nunderstanding  the  link  between  financial  inclusion  and  poverty  and  income  inequality  in  developing \nAsia.  By  creating  our  own  measure  of  financial  inclusion  based  on  existing  methodology,  we  can \nincrease  our  sample  for  developing  Asia  as  well  as  utilize  all  available  data  for  each  economy.  By \nfocusing on developing Asia, we cover diverse samples ranging from large growing economies like the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, India, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Indonesia; to small developing \ncountries  like  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  Nepal,  Samoa,  and  to  transition  economies  like  Kazakhstan, \nArmenia,  and  Georgia,  among  others.  Common  to  this  diverse  set  of  economies  is  their  sustained \neconomic expansion, more so during the last decade, but they do exhibit varying levels of development \nand economic structures.  Lastly, using our own financial inclusion indicator, we test the importance of \nfinancial inclusion in reducing poverty  and lowering income  inequality in developing  Asia. This study \nasks  the  following  questions:  First,  what  are  the factors  that  influence  the  level  of  financial  access  in \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1  \n\nIn  this  paper,  developing  Asia  refers  to  37  economies  in  the  region  including  Afghanistan  (AFG);  Armenia  (ARM); \nAzerbaijan  (AZE);  Bangladesh  (BAN);  Bhutan  (BHU);  Brunei  Darussalam  (BRU);  Cambodia  (CAM);  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC); Fiji (FIJ); Georgia (GEO); Hong Kong, China (HKG); India (IND); Indonesia (INO); Kazakhstan \n(KAZ); Kiribati (KIR); the Republic of Korea (KOR); the Kyrgyz Republic (KGZ); the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(LAO); Malaysia (MAL); the Maldives (MLD); Mongolia (MON); Myanmar (MYA); Nepal (NEP); Pakistan (PAK); Papua \nNew  Guinea  (PNG);  the  Philippines  (PHI);  Samoa  (SAM);  Singapore  (SIN);    Solomon  Islands  (SOL);  Sri  Lanka  (SRI); \nTajikistan (TAJ); Thailand (THA); Timor-Leste (TIM); Tonga (TON); Uzbekistan (UZB); Vanuatu (VAN); and Viet Nam \n(VIE).   \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 426 \n\ndeveloping  Asia?  Second,  does  financial  access  affect  poverty  and  income  inequality  in  developing \nAsia? \n\n \nFollowing the methodology of Sarma (2008), we constructed financial inclusion indicator for \neach developing Asian economy in the sample which broadly resembles those of Honohan (2008) and \nSarma  (2008).  The  estimation  results  show  that  per  capita  income,  rule  of  law,  and  population  size \nincrease  financial  inclusion;  while  age  dependency  ratio  lowers  financial  inclusion.    Importantly,  the \nfindings also indicate that financial inclusion lowers poverty and income inequality in developing Asia.  \n \n\nThis  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  II  discusses  financial  inclusion  and  provides  a \nliterature review. Section III provides the methodology for the construction of our financial inclusion \nindicator  and  some  stylized  facts.  Section  IV  presents  the  empirical  methodology,  data  sources,  and \ndeterminants  of  poverty  and  income  inequality,  including  our  financial  inclusion  indicator.  Section  V \nhighlights the key findings. Section VI summarizes and offers some policy recommendations.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRELATED LITERATURE \n\n \nExisting literature on financial inclusion has varying definitions of the concept. Many studies define the \nconcept  in  terms  of  financial  exclusion,  which  relates  to  the  broader  context  of  social  inclusion.  For \nexample, Leyshon (1995) highlights the exclusion of some groups and individuals from gaining access \nto formal financial system, while Sinclair (2001) focuses on the inability to access necessary financial \nservices in an appropriate form. In contrast, Amid\u017ei\u0107, Massara, and Mialou (2014) and Sarma (2008) \ndirectly define financial inclusion. Amid\u017ei\u0107, Massara, and Mialou (2014) stated that financial inclusion \nis an economic state where individuals and firms are not denied access to basic financial services. This \npaper follows the definition of Sarma (2008) which views financial inclusion as a process that ensures \nthe  ease  of  access,  availability,  and  usage  of  financial  services  of  all  members  of  society.  Unlike  the \ndefinition of Amid\u017ei\u0107, Massara, and Mialou (2014), the advantage of Sarma\u2019s (2008) definition is that \nit  builds  the  concept  of  financial  inclusion  based  on    several  dimensions,  including  accessibility, \navailability, and usage, which can be discussed separately. \n \n\nAlthough there is consensus on how financial inclusion is defined, there is no standard method \nby  which  it  can  be  measured.  Consequently,  existing  studies  offer  varying  measures  of  financial \ninclusion.  For  instance,  Honohan  (2007  and  2008)  constructed  a  financial  access  indicator  which \ncaptures  the  fraction  of  adult  population  in  a  given  economy  with  access  to  formal  financial \nintermediaries.  The composite financial access indicator was constructed using household survey data \nfor economies with available data on financial access. For those without household survey on financial \naccess, the indicator was derived using information on bank account numbers and GDP per capita. The \ndataset  was  constructed  as  a  cross-section  series  using  the  most  recent  data  as  the  reference  year, \nwhich varies across economies.  However, Honohan\u2019s (2007 and 2008) measure provides a snapshot \nof  financial  inclusion  and  might  not  be  applicable  for  understanding  changes  over  time  and  across \neconomies.  \n\n \nAmid\u017ei\u0107,  Massara,  and  Mialou  (2014)  constructed  a  financial  inclusion  indicator  as  a \ncomposite indicator of variables pertaining to its dimensions, outreach (geographic and demographic \npenetration), usage (deposit and lending), and quality (disclosure requirement, dispute resolution, and \n\n\fFinancial Inclusion, Poverty, and Income Inequality in Developing Asia   |   3 \n\ncost  of  usage).2   Each  measure  is  normalized,  statistically  identified  for  each  dimension,  and  then \naggregated using statistical weights. The aggregation technique follows weighted geometric mean.  A \ndrawback from this approach is that it uses factor analysis method to determine which variables are to \nbe included for each dimension. Therefore, it does not fully utilize all available data for each country.  \nFurthermore,  it  assigns  various  weights  for  each  dimension,  which  implies  the  importance  of  one \nmeasure versus another. \n \n\nSarma  (2008)  follows  a  different  approach  to  construct  the  indicator.  He  first  computed  a \ndimension  index  for  each  dimension  of  financial  inclusion  and  then  aggregated  each  index  as  the \nnormalized inverse of Euclidean distance, where the distance is computed from a reference ideal point, \nand then normalized by the number of dimensions included in the aggregate index. The advantage of \nthis approach is its ease of computation and it does not impose varying weights for each dimension.  \nFor this reasons, this paper closely follows Sarma\u2019s (2008) approach. \n\n \nPrevious studies have also looked into the impact of financial inclusion on poverty and income \ninequality. Burgess and Pande (2005) found that state-led expansion of rural bank branches in India \nhas  helped  reduce  poverty.  Specifically,  the  authors  found  robust  evidence  that  opening  bank \nbranches  in  rural  unbanked  locations  in  India  was  associated  with  reduction  in  rural  poverty  rates  in \nthose areas. Similarly, Brune et al. (2011) found that increased financial access through commitment \nsaving  account  in  rural  Malawi  improves  the  well-being  of  poor  households  as  it  provides  access  to \ntheir  savings  for  agricultural  input  use.  Allen  et  al.  (2013)  found  that  by  tapping  underprivileged \nhouseholds, commercial banks can help improve financial access of the poor in Kenya. \n\n \nUnlike  Amid\u017ei\u0107,  Massara,  and  Mialou  (2014)  and  Sarma  (2008),  Honohan  (2008) \nconstructed  a  financial  access  indicator  for  160  economies  that  combines  both  household  survey \ndatasets  and  published  financial  institutions  data  into  a  composite  indicator;  and  assessed  country \ncharacteristics  that  might  influence  financial  access.  Among  the  variables  tested,  aid  as  percent  of \ngross national income (GNI), age dependency ratio, and population density significantly lower financial \naccess;  while  mobile  phone  subscription  and  quality  of  institutions  significantly  increase  financial \naccess. Looking at the cross-country link between poverty and financial access, his results show that \nfinancial access significantly reduces poverty, but the  result is valid only when financial  access is the \nsole regressor, i.e., it loses significance when other variables are added as regressors.  \n\n \nIn  an  earlier  version  of  his  paper,  Honohan  (2007)  tested  the  significance  of  his  financial \naccess indictor in reducing income equality. His results show that higher financial access significantly \nreduces  income  inequality  as  measured  by  the  Gini  coefficient.  However,  the  link  between  the  two \nvariables depends on which specification is used, i.e., when the access variable is included on its own \nand/or includes financial depth measure, the results are significant, but the same does not hold when \nper capita income and dummy variables are included. \n\n \nRojas-Suarez  (2010)  used  the  same  indicator  constructed  by  Honohan  (2008)  to  test  the \nsignificance of various macroeconomic and country characteristics for a group of emerging economies, \nincluding  some  from  developing  Asia.  The  results  show  that  economic  volatility,  weak  rule  of  law, \nhigher income inequality, and social underdevelopment and regulatory constraints significantly lower \nfinancial  access.  In  addition,  various  country  grouping  dummy  variables  were  also  found  to  be \nsignificant  especially  for  large  emerging  economies.  However,  unlike  the  estimation  of  Honohan, \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2   Although  Amid\u017ei\u0107,  Massara,  and  Mialou  (2014)  defined  proxies  for  quality  measure,  they  did  not  include  it  in  their \n\ncomposite indicator due to lack of reliable and available data.  \n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 426 \n\nRojas-Suarez (2010) used weighted least squares estimation to account for heteroskedasticity in their \nsample. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nFINANCIAL INCLUSION INDICATOR \n\n \nBefore  testing  the  significance  of  financial  inclusion  in  reducing  poverty  and  lowering  income \ninequality in developing Asia, we first construct our own financial inclusion indicator. The motivations \nfor  constructing  our  own  financial  inclusion  indicator  are  as  follows:  1)  we  need  to  include  as  many \ndeveloping Asian economies in our sample; using previously computed indicator will limit our sample \nsize, which can lead to biased results; 2) there is a need to develop a consistent measure of financial \ninclusion  for  a  large  sample  of  economies,  which  will  be  used  to  standardize  the  measure  for \ndeveloping Asia; and 3) we can compare our own financial inclusion indicator with previous measures. \n \n\nWe  closely  follow  the  methodology  of  Sarma  (2008)  in  constructing  our  financial  inclusion \nindicator.  Specifically,  we  include  five  measures  namely,  automated  teller  machines  (ATM)  per \n100,000 adults, commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults, borrowers from commercial banks per \n1,000  adults,  depositors  with  commercial  banks  per  1,000  adults,  and  domestic  credit  to  GDP  ratio. \nThe first two measures pertain to availability of banking services as a dimension of financial inclusion, \nwhile the last three refers to the usage dimension of financial inclusion. All indicators are sourced from \nthe World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators, and each indicator for each economy pertains to the \naverage  value  from  2004  to  2012.  We  chose  to  use  period  average  values,  instead  of  focusing  on  a \nparticular  year,  to  avoid  annual  fluctuations  and  to  include  as  many  economies  as  possible.  In  total, \ndata for 188 economies are downloaded, including those from developing Asia. \n\n \nAfter  computing  the  period  average  for  each  financial  inclusion  indicator  for  188  economies, \nwe  then  calculate  the  dimension  index,  following  the  specification  of  Sarma  (2008),  where  the \ndimension index for ith dimension di is derived as: \n \n\n(cid:1856)(cid:3036) (cid:3404) \t\n\n(cid:3002)(cid:3284)(cid:2879)(cid:3040)(cid:3284)\n(cid:3014)(cid:3284)(cid:2879)\t(cid:3040)(cid:3284)\n\n\u00a0                                                                              (1) \n\n \nwhere Ai is the actual value of dimension i, mi is the minimum value of dimension i, Mi is the maximum \nvalue of dimension i. The index of financial inclusion for country i is then measured by the normalized \ninverse of Euclidean distance of point di computed in Equation (1) from the ideal point I which is equal \nto 1. Specifically, the formula is given by: \n \n\n(cid:1832)(cid:1835)(cid:1835)(cid:3036) (cid:3404) 1 (cid:3398) \t\n\n(cid:3493)(cid:4666)(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3031)(cid:3117)(cid:4667)(cid:3118)(cid:2878)(cid:4666)(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3031)(cid:3118)(cid:4667)(cid:3118)(cid:2878)\t\u2026(cid:4666)(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3031)(cid:3289)(cid:4667)(cid:3118)\n\u221a(cid:3041)\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(2) \n\n \nwhere the second term of the numerator in Equation (2) is the Euclidean distance from an ideal point, \nnormalizing  it  by  the  square  root  of  the  number  of  observations  and  subtracting  it  by  1,  giving  the \ninverse  normalized  distance.  We  normalized  the  indicator  in  order  to  make  the  computed  values  lie \nbetween  0  and  1,  where  1  corresponds  to  the  highest  financial  inclusion  index  and  0  is  the  lowest, \nfollowing Sarma (2008). \n \n\nOne  difference  between  our  measure  with  Sarma\u2019s  (2008)  indicator  is  that  we  include  all \navailable data regardless of dimension. In Sarma\u2019s (2008) index, domestic credit and domestic deposit \nare  included  as  measures  of  usage  dimension.  In  our  index,  we  include  borrowers  and  depositors  on \n\n\fFinancial Inclusion, Poverty, and Income Inequality in Developing Asia   |   5 \n\ncommercial banks, along with domestic credit (% of GDP) as a measure of usage. The main reason for \nthis is to increase our sample size. If we restrict our variables to those used by Sarma (2008), we will \nhave smaller sample size. Using the above-mentioned five measures make our indicator more precise \nas it utilizes all available information. \n\n \nTable  1  presents  our  computed  financial  inclusion  indicator.  Several  observations  are  noted. \nFirst,  advanced  countries  tend  to  have  higher  financial  inclusion  than  emerging  and  developing \neconomies.  This  observation  is  similar  to  those  of  Honohan  (2008)  and  Sarma  (2008).  In  fact,  our \nranking is highly consistent with those of Sarma\u2019s (2008). Second, interestingly, some small economies \nhave very high financial inclusion indicators despite being developing economies. For instance, St. Kitts \nand Nevis, the Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, and Grenada are included in the top one-third \nof the ranking table, maybe due to fact that these countries are offshore financial centers. Third, our \ncomputed  financial  inclusion  indicator  follows  the  same  pattern  as  those  of  Honohan  (2008)  and \nSarma  (2008).  Figure  1  shows  the  comparison  with  Honohan\u2019s  (2008)  indicator,  and  Figure  2  for \nSarma\u2019s  (2008)  measure.  Both  figures  imply  that  for  economies  where  we  calculated  a  high  (low) \nfinancial  inclusion  indicator,  both  Honohan  (2008)  and  Sarma  (2008)  also  computed  a  high  (low) \nfinancial  inclusion,  suggesting  a  similar  pattern  between  various  measures.  Lastly,  across  developing \nAsia, there is a variation on the level of financial inclusion. Figure 3 illustrates that some economies in \nAsia  have  very  high  financial  inclusion,  while  others  have  very  low.  The  median  level  of  financial \ninclusion is 24. Surprisingly, some developing economies in Asia have higher-than-expected financial \ninclusion indicator, such as Mongolia, Fiji, the Maldives, Uzbekistan, and Samoa. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 426 \n\nEconomy \n\nFII \n\nRank \n\nEconomy \n\nFII \n\nRank \n\nFII \n\nRank \n\nTable 1: Financial Inclusion Index \n \n\nSpain \n\nPortugal \n\nLuxembourg \n\nUnited States \n\nIceland \n\nJapan \n\nCanada \n\nSwitzerland \n\nBelgium \n\nAustralia \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nKorea, Rep. of \n\nDenmark \n\nItaly \n\nIreland \n\nCroatia \n\nFrance \n\nEstonia \n\nBulgaria \n\nIsrael \n\nGreece \n\nNew Zealand \n\nNetherlands \n\nSingapore \n\nSlovenia \n\nGermany \n\nMalta \n\nAustria \n\nSt. Kitts and Nevis \n\n90.98 \n\n81.97 \n\n81.96 \n\n80.10 \n\n79.72 \n\n78.32 \n\n74.90 \n\n74.41 \n\n70.70 \n\n69.48 \n\n68.95 \n\n68.89 \n\n68.30 \n\n67.48 \n\n66.99 \n\n65.93 \n\n64.87 \n\n63.51 \n\n61.96 \n\n59.71 \n\n58.97 \n\n58.73 \n\n58.73 \n\n58.27 \n\n58.24 \n\n57.64 \n\n55.90 \n\n55.63 \n\n53.91 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28 \n\n29 \n\nBrazil \n\nBahamas, The \n\nAntigua and Barbuda \n\nBrunei Darussalam \n\nHong Kong, China \n\nLatvia \n\nChile \n\nLebanon \n\nTurkey \n\nHungary \n\nAruba \n\nMalaysia \n\nOman \n\nUkraine \n\nSweden \n\nThailand \n\nGrenada \n\nFinland \n\nPanama \n\nNorway \n\nBelize \n\nKuwait \n\nSt. Lucia \n\nQatar \n\nKosovo \n\nMongolia \n\nSouth Africa \n\nMontenegro \n\n53.66 \n\n52.90 \n\n52.69 \n\n52.30 \n\n51.68 \n\n51.08 \n\n50.83 \n\n50.76 \n\n50.64 \n\n50.59 \n\n47.39 \n\n47.09 \n\n46.42 \n\n46.26 \n\n45.96 \n\n45.59 \n\n44.78 \n\n44.03 \n\n44.02 \n\n43.61 \n\n43.31 \n\n43.22 \n\n43.00 \n\n42.35 \n\n42.27 \n\n42.01 \n\n40.87 \n\n40.60 \n\n40.46 \n\nEconomy \nBosnia and \n\nHerzegovina \n\nMauritius \n\nSeychelles \n\nCabo Verde \n\nRomania \n\nSerbia \n\nLithuania \n\nBarbados \n\nPoland \n\nJordan \n\nColombia \n\nUruguay \n\nFiji \n\nMaldives \n\nCosta Rica \n\nSlovak Republic \n\nCzech Republic \n\nDominica \nUnited Arab \nEmirates \n\nEcuador \n\nSuriname \n\nUzbekistan \n\nMorocco \n\nArgentina \nChina, People\u2019s \n\nRep. of \n\nSamoa \nSt. Vincent and the \n\nGrenadines \n\nGuatemala \n\n30 \n\n31 \n\n32 \n\n33 \n\n34 \n\n35 \n\n36 \n\n37 \n\n38 \n\n39 \n\n40 \n\n41 \n\n42 \n\n43 \n\n44 \n\n45 \n\n46 \n\n47 \n\n48 \n\n49 \n\n50 \n\n51 \n\n52 \n\n53 \n\n54 \n\n55 \n\n56 \n\n57 \n\n58 \n\n39.90 \n\n39.70 \n\n39.68 \n\n39.13 \n\n38.94 \n\n37.74 \n\n37.70 \n\n37.66 \n\n37.35 \n\n37.11 \n\n37.09 \n\n36.62 \n\n35.14 \n\n34.21 \n\n34.00 \n\n33.70 \n\n33.67 \n\n33.04 \n\n32.60 \n\n32.33 \n\n32.18 \n\n31.03 \n\n30.99 \n\n30.86 \n\n30.85 \n\n30.22 \n\n29.86 \n\n29.80 \n\n29.56 \n\n59 \n\n60 \n\n61 \n\n62 \n\n63 \n\n64 \n\n65 \n\n66 \n\n67 \n\n68 \n\n69 \n\n70 \n\n71 \n\n72 \n\n73 \n\n74 \n\n75 \n\n76 \n\n77 \n\n78 \n\n79 \n\n80 \n\n81 \n\n82 \n\n83 \n\n84 \n\n85 \n\n86 \n\n87 \n\ncontinued on next page\n\nRussian Federation \n\nMacedonia, Rep. of \n\n\fFinancial Inclusion, Poverty, and Income Inequality in Developing Asia   |   7 \n\nFII \n\nRank \n\nEconomy \n\nFII \n\nRank \n\nEconomy \n\nRank \n\n20.17 \n\nKyrgyz Republic \n\nTable 1   continued \n\nEconomy \n\nTunisia \n\nIran, Islamic Rep. of \n\nVenezuela, RB \n\nKazakhstan \n\nDominican Republic \n\nGeorgia \n\nTonga \n\nMexico \n\nVanuatu \n\nAlbania \n\nHonduras \n\nEl Salvador \n\nPeru \n\nMyanmar \n\nIndonesia \n\nSaudi Arabia \n\nIndia \n\nMoldova \n\nArmenia \n\nBotswana \n\nLiberia \n\nLibya \n\nTrinidad and Tobago \n\nAfghanistan \n\nViet Nam \nCongo, Dem.

First, we \ntest  which  factors  significantly  increase  or  decrease  financial  inclusion  in  developing  Asia.  Using  the \ncomputed financial inclusion indicator for 37  developing Asian  economies presented in the previous \nsection, we use its log value as the dependent variable and test the significance of various regressors, \nfollowing Honohan\u2019s (2008) regressors.  \n \n\nWe test the significance of per capita income and argue that higher per capita income should \nincrease  financial  inclusion  as  those  with  insufficient  income  and  high  risk  profile  will  no  longer  be \nexcluded from financial services (Figure 4). Better rule of law should also increase financial inclusion as \nit improves enforcement of financial contracts (Figure 5). Higher age dependency ratio should reduce \nfinancial inclusion as a larger segment of the population are either too young or above the retirement \nage which impedes their access to financial services as they do not earn income (Figure 6).

The  estimates \nreveal that when both per capita income and rule of law are considered, the latter loses its significance, \nsuggesting  that  per  capita  income  is  the  main  determinant  for  financial  inclusion  in  developing  Asia \nand that involuntary financial exclusion in the region may be driven largely by insufficient household \nincome  and  high  risk  profile  rather  than  market  failures  and  weak  enforcement  of  contracts.  These \nresults  are  consistent  with  the  findings  of  Honohan  (2008).  However,  unlike  the  estimates  of \nHonohan (2008), we find robust evidence showing the importance of per capita income on financial \ninclusion.  But  similar  to  Honohan\u2019s  (2008)  results,  primary  education  completion  and  literacy  rates \nhave no significant effect on the level of financial inclusion in developing Asia. \n \n\nTable 3 shows the results on the impact of financial access on poverty. Across specifications, \nwe added other variables used by Honohan (2008) on the regressors of poverty rate and also added \nspecifications  with  interaction  term  between  per  capita  income  and  financial  inclusion  as  well  as \ngrowth rates and rule of law. Some economies were dropped from the estimation due to unavailable \ndata.

Across  specifications,  financial  inclusion  appears  significant  and  with  a \nnegative  sign.  Our  results  also  provide  support  on  the  role  of  educational  attainment  in  lowering \npoverty  rates,  although  it  loses  significance  when  more  determinants  are  added.  This  finding  is \nconsistent  with  the  view  that  education  reduces  poverty  as  it  enables  individuals  to  acquire  and  use \nknowledge and skills that increase their employment prospects and, therefore, earn higher wages. For \nspecification  (8),  where  all  variables  are  included,  the  dummy  variable  for  low-income  economies \nwithin  developing  Asia  is  significant,  suggesting  that  low-income  economies  tend  to  have  higher \npoverty  rates.  Lastly,  the  interaction  term  between  per  capita  income  and  financial  inclusion \nsignificantly lowers poverty rates, giving further support on the importance of raising income levels in \nlowering poverty rates.  \n \n\nTable 3: Regression Results on Poverty \n \n\nVariables \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n(6) \n\n(7) \n\n(8) \n\nFinancial inclusion (log) \n\n  \nRatio of highest to lowest 20% \n\nincome \n\n\u20130.339*** \n\n[\u20133.110] \n\nInflation (log) \n\nEducation completion (log) \n\nGrowth in bank claims (log) \n\n  \nLow-income economy \n\ndummy \n\nGrowth rate (log) \n\nRule of law (log) \n\nGNI*Financial inclusion \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nObservations \n\nR-squared \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\u20130.229** \n\n\u20130.315*** \n\n\u20130.321*** \n\n\u20130.276*** \n\n\u20130.290** \n\n\u20130.255* \n\n[\u20132.077] \n\n[\u20133.201] \n\n[\u20133.113] \n\n[\u20132.864] \n\n[\u20132.294] \n\n[\u20131.983] \n\n\u20130.301 \n\n\u20130.339 \n\n\u20130.276 \n\n\u20130.289 \n\n\u20130.208 \n\n[\u20131.025] \n\n[\u20131.257] \n\n[\u20131.089] \n\n[\u20131.082] \n\n[\u20130.678] \n\n\u20130.041 \n\n\u20130.026 \n\n\u20130.043 \n\n\u20130.065 \n\n[\u20130.240] \n\n[\u20130.160] \n\n[\u20130.167] \n\n[\u20130.239] \n\n\u20130.428** \n\n\u20130.386 \n\n\u20130.278 \n\n[\u20132.213] \n\n[\u20131.628] \n\n[\u20131.110] \n\n\u20130.004 \n\n\u20130.001 \n\n[\u20130.031] \n\n[\u20130.009] \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n0.130* \n\n[1.763] \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n33 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\u20130.047 \n\n[\u20130.326] \n\n\u20130.074 \n\n[\u20131.488] \n\n\u20130.069*** \n\n[\u20132.911] \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nConstant \n\n1.789*** \n\n1.639*** \n\n1.790*** \n\n2.001*** \n\n2.071*** \n\n2.783*** \n\n2.751*** \n\n2.418*** \n\n[13.557] \n\n[18.191] \n\n[10.476] \n\n[6.982] \n\n[6.393] \n\n[6.204] \n\n[5.526] \n\n[4.118] \n\n36 \n\n36 \n\n  \n\n36 \n\n  \n\n35 \n\n  \n\n35 \n\n  \n\n35 \n\n  \n\n33 \n\n0.215 \n\n0.232 \n\n0.257 \n\n0.254 \n\n0.255 \n\n0.290 \n\n0.288 \n\n0.324 \n\nGNI = gross national income. \nNote: Values in brackets are t-stat. ***, **, and * refer to significant at p<0.01, p<0.05, and p<0.10, respectively. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n\nTable 4 presents the results on the significance of financial inclusion on income inequality. The \nspecifications and variables closely follow those of Table 3, except that we dropped the proportion of \nhigh-income  to  low-income  groups,  and  replaced  the  interaction  term  with  per  capita  GNI.  Our \nestimates  show  that  the  correlation  between  income  inequality  and  financial  inclusion  is  significant \nonly for some specifications.  Although the coefficients have the correct sign, only specifications (6) \nand (7), where more regressors are considered, show significant negative correlation between the two \nmeasures.  Among the other determinants of income inequality, inflation significantly lowers income \ninequality,  and  the  estimates  are  robust  across  specifications.    Economic  literature  has  long  debated \n\n\f16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 426 \n\nthe  impact  of  inflation  on  income  inequality.  On  one  hand,  some  papers  argue  that  higher  inflation \ntends  to  redistribute  wealth  between  creditor  and  debtor,  with  the  latter  repudiating  debt  when \nunexpected  inflation  is  high.  This  helps  reduce  income  inequality  especially  among  the  heavily \nindebted  lower  income  households.  On  the  other  hand,  higher  inflation  is  associated  with  stronger \neconomic  growth,  which  in  turn  can  increase  income  inequality.5 Our  estimates  favor  the  former \nexplanation where higher inflation leads to lower income inequality in developing Asia, due to wealth \nredistribution effects. \n \n\nTable 4: Regression Results on Income Inequality \n\n \n\nVariables \nFinancial inclusion \n\n(log) \n\n  \nInflation (log) \n  \nEducation completion \n\n  \nGrowth in bank claims \n\n(log) \n\n(log) \n\n  \nLow-income economy \n\ndummy \n\n  \nGrowth rate (log) \n  \nRule of law (log) \n  \nPoverty*Financial \n\ninclusion \n\n  \nConstant \n  \n  \nObservations \nR-squared \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n(6) \n\n(7) \n\n0.033 \n[0.897] \n\n\u20130.068 \n[\u20131.616] \n  \n  \n\n\u20130.029 \n[\u20130.834] \n\u20130.211*** \n[\u20134.420] \n\n\u20130.052 \n[\u20131.505] \n\u20130.219*** \n[\u20134.736] \n\n\u20130.065* \n[\u20131.741] \n\u20130.217*** \n[\u20133.734] \n\n\u20130.073* \n[\u20131.742] \n\u20130.201*** \n[\u20133.411] \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n\u20130.009 \n[\u20130.178] \n\n0.055*** \n[3.559] \n\n  \n  \n1.590*** \n\n[23.517] \n  \n34 \n0.287 \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n0.153** \n[2.065] \n\n0.186* \n[2.029] \n\n0.150 \n[1.643] \n\n\u20130.033 \n[\u20130.624] \n\n\u20130.033 \n[\u20130.597] \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\u20130.035 \n[\u20131.599] \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n1.580*** \n[7.980] \n\n  \n33 \n0.514 \n\n  \n  \n1.534*** \n[31.550] \n\n  \n34 \n0.023 \n\n0.006 \n[0.212] \n1.568*** \n\n[35.913] \n  \n34 \n0.001 \n\n  \n  \n1.781*** \n[25.258] \n  \n34 \n0.396 \n\n  \n  \n1.518*** \n[8.608] \n\n  \n34 \n0.447 \n\n  \n  \n1.505*** \n[7.865] \n\n  \n33 \n0.480 \n\nNote: Values in brackets are t-stat. ***, **, and * refer to significant at p<0.01, p<0.05, and p<0.10, respectively. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n \n\nTo  conduct  some  robustness  checks,  we  also  tested  the  results  using  Honohan\u2019s  (2007  and \n2008) financial access indicator for 30 economies in developing Asia with derived data.

We  closely  follow  the  methodology  of \nSarma (2008), although we utilized more data in our indicator. Our financial inclusion indicator shows \na similar pattern (in terms) of ranking as those of Honohan (2008) and Sarma (2008). We then tested \nwhich  factors  significantly  influence  financial  inclusion  indicator  in  developing  Asia.  Our  estimates \nshow  the  importance  of  per  capita  income,  rule  of  law,  and  demographic  factors.    Next,  we  test \nwhether  or  not  financial  inclusion  in  the  region  helps  reduce  poverty  and  income  inequality.  Our \nfindings clearly show a robust and significant correlation between higher financial inclusion and lower \npoverty  and  income  inequality.  The  findings  are  robust  using  Honohan\u2019s  (2008)  financial  access \nindicator. Based on our empirical results, we offer several policy implications. \n \n\nFirst, demographic characteristics of economies in developing Asia significantly influence the \nlevel  of  financial  inclusion.  Economies  with  large  population  sizes  tend  to  have  greater  access  to \nfinancial  services,  while  those  with  high  dependency  ratios  have  lower  access  to  financial  services. \nThese have important policy implications, especially for economies that have rapidly aging population \nstructures.  For  these  economies,  the  provision  of  retirement  pensions  and  other  old-age  benefits \nwould be crucial in broadening access to financial services of old-age population. \n\n \nSecond, similar to the findings of Honohan (2008) and Rojas-Suarez (2010), good governance \nand  high  institutional  quality  significantly  increase  financial  inclusion.  This  implies  that  to  broaden \nfinancial access, economies- in developing Asia must continue to improve the quality of its governance \nand institutions, specifically through strengthening the rule of law, including enforcement of financial \ncontracts and financial regulatory oversight. Maintaining high quality rule of law will reduce involuntary \nfinancial exclusion of large segments of the population.  \n\n \nThird,  our  estimates  offer  evidence  of  a  strong  correlation  between  financial  access  and \npoverty  rates.  To  reduce  poverty  rates  in  the  region,  policymakers  must  implement  policies  that  will \ninclusive  growth  must \naddress \ncomplement efforts to increase financial inclusion. Of growing importance is the role of microfinance.  \nAvailability of credit to lower income groups improves their access to financial services, which in turn \nenables them to undertake productive activities and smoothen their consumption in the face of short-\nterm adverse shocks. \n\ninclusion.  In  this  regard,  promoting \n\nimpediments  to  financial \n\n \nFinally,  our  estimates  provide  some  evidence  on  the  role  of  financial  inclusion  on  income \ninequality.    Increasing  financial  inclusion  or  reducing  involuntary  financial  exclusion  lowers  income \ninequality in developing Asia. To further reduce income inequality, more measures must be taken to \naddress financial exclusion of low-income groups from financial services. In this context, programs that \nwill help alleviate poverty will likewise address growing income inequality in the region.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\f\u00a0\n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAllen, F. E. Carletti, R.
