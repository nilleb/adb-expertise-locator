Financial inclusion is \noften considered as a critical element that makes growth inclusive as access to finance can enable \neconomic agents to make longer-term consumption and investment decisions, participate in productive \nactivities,  and cope with unexpected short-term  shocks.  Understanding the  link between financial \ninclusion,  poverty,  and  income  inequality  at  the  country  level  will  help  policymakers  design  and \nimplement programs that will broaden access to financial services, leading to reduction of poverty \nincidence and income equality.  This paper extends the existing literature on financial inclusion by \nfocusing on developing Asian economies. We construct our own financial inclusion indicator to assess \nvarious macroeconomic and country-specific factors affecting the degree of financial inclusion for 37 \nselected developing Asian economies. We also test the impact of financial inclusion, along with other \ncontrol variables, on poverty and income inequality. Our results show that per capita income, rule of law, \nand demographic characteristics significantly affect financial inclusion in developing Asia. Furthermore, \nwe find that financial inclusion significantly reduces poverty; and there is also evidence that it lowers \nincome inequality. Our findings suggest that the provisions for young and old-age populations, e.g., \nretirement pensions; and stronger rule of law, including enforcement of financial contracts and financial \nregulatory oversight, will broaden financial inclusion, thereby contributing to poverty reduction and lower \nincome inequality. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: financial inclusion, developing Asia, poverty, income inequality \n \nJEL Classification: G18, O11, O16 \n ", "\u00a0\nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nOne of developing Asia\u2019s success stories is its sustained economic expansion which lifted millions out \nof poverty. But poverty remains a stubborn challenge across the region, with evidence pointing to \ndeteriorating income equality in recent years. The challenge for the region\u2019s policymakers is to the \nreach of the socioeconomic benefits associated with rapid economic expansion. Financial inclusion is \ncritical as increasing the poor\u2019s access to financial services is often considered as an effective tool that \ncan help reduce poverty and lower income inequality.  \n \nFinancial inclusion is a broad concept. As defined by Sarma (2008), financial inclusion is the \nprocess that ensures the ease of access, availability, and usage of formal financial system for all \nmembers of an economy. However, it is also important to distinguish between voluntary versus \ninvoluntary exclusion. The World Bank (2014) defines voluntary exclusion as a condition where the \nsegment of the population or firms choose not to use financial services either because they have no \nneed for them or due to cultural or religious reasons. In contrast, involuntary exclusion arises from \ninsufficient income and high risk profile or due to discrimination and market failures and imperfections. \nPolicy and research initiatives must then focus on involuntary exclusion as it can be addressed by \nappropriate economic programs and policies which can be designed to increase income levels and \ncorrect market failures and imperfections. \n \nAlthough financial inclusion has become topical on the global policy agenda for sustainable \ndevelopment, economic literature on financial inclusion is still in its infancy. Most studies have looked \ninto the appropriate measures of financial inclusion both at household and country levels, while some \npapers focused on the role of financial access in lowering poverty and income inequality.  Other papers \nhave dealt with varying levels of financial inclusion both in advanced and emerging economies. These \npapers have laid the foundations in this field and provide key policy insights on the importance of \nfinancial inclusion on sustainable development.  However, more work needs to be done.  \n \nThis paper contributes to the existing literature by 1) developing a financial inclusion measure \nwhich  utilizes  available  cross-country  data,  2)  focusing  on  developing  Asian  economies,1 and  3) \nunderstanding the link between financial inclusion and poverty and income inequality in developing \nAsia. By creating our own measure of financial inclusion based on existing methodology, we can \nincrease our sample for developing Asia as well as utilize all available data for each economy. By \nfocusing on developing Asia, we cover diverse samples ranging from large growing economies like the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, India, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Indonesia; to small developing \ncountries  like  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  Nepal,  Samoa,  and  to  transition  economies  like  Kazakhstan, \nArmenia, and Georgia, among others. Common to this diverse set of economies is their sustained \neconomic expansion, more so during the last decade, but they do exhibit varying levels of development \nand economic structures.  Lastly, using our own financial inclusion indicator, we test the importance of \nfinancial inclusion in reducing poverty and lowering income inequality in developing Asia.

Second, does financial access affect poverty and income inequality in developing \nAsia? \n \nFollowing the methodology of Sarma (2008), we constructed financial inclusion indicator for \neach developing Asian economy in the sample which broadly resembles those of Honohan (2008) and \nSarma (2008). The estimation results show that per capita income, rule of law, and population size \nincrease financial inclusion; while age dependency ratio lowers financial inclusion.  Importantly, the \nfindings also indicate that financial inclusion lowers poverty and income inequality in developing Asia.  \n \nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses financial inclusion and provides a \nliterature review. Section III provides the methodology for the construction of our financial inclusion \nindicator and some stylized facts. Section IV presents the empirical methodology, data sources, and \ndeterminants of poverty and income inequality, including our financial inclusion indicator. Section V \nhighlights the key findings. Section VI summarizes and offers some policy recommendations.  \n \n \nII.  RELATED LITERATURE \n \nExisting literature on financial inclusion has varying definitions of the concept. Many studies define the \nconcept in terms of financial exclusion, which relates to the broader context of social inclusion. For \nexample, Leyshon (1995) highlights the exclusion of some groups and individuals from gaining access \nto formal financial system, while Sinclair (2001) focuses on the inability to access necessary financial \nservices in an appropriate form. In contrast, Amid\u017ei\u0107, Massara, and Mialou (2014) and Sarma (2008) \ndirectly define financial inclusion. Amid\u017ei\u0107, Massara, and Mialou (2014) stated that financial inclusion \nis an economic state where individuals and firms are not denied access to basic financial services. This \npaper follows the definition of Sarma (2008) which views financial inclusion as a process that ensures \nthe ease of access, availability, and usage of financial services of all members of society. Unlike the \ndefinition of Amid\u017ei\u0107, Massara, and Mialou (2014), the advantage of Sarma\u2019s (2008) definition is that \nit builds the concept of financial inclusion based on  several dimensions, including  accessibility, \navailability, and usage, which can be discussed separately. \n \nAlthough there is consensus on how financial inclusion is defined, there is no standard method \nby which it can be measured. Consequently, existing studies offer varying measures of financial \ninclusion. For instance, Honohan (2007 and 2008) constructed a financial access indicator which \ncaptures  the  fraction  of  adult  population  in  a  given  economy  with  access  to  formal  financial \nintermediaries.  The composite financial access indicator was constructed using household survey data \nfor economies with available data on financial access. For those without household survey on financial \naccess, the indicator was derived using information on bank account numbers and GDP per capita. The \ndataset was constructed as a cross-section series using the most recent data as the reference year, \nwhich varies across economies.  However, Honohan\u2019s (2007 and 2008) measure provides a snapshot \nof financial inclusion and might not be applicable for understanding changes over time and across \neconomies.  \n \nAmid\u017ei\u0107,  Massara,  and  Mialou  (2014)  constructed  a  financial  inclusion  indicator  as  a \ncomposite indicator of variables pertaining to its dimensions, outreach (geographic and demographic \npenetration), usage (deposit and lending), and quality (disclosure requirement, dispute resolution, and ", "Financial Inclusion, Poverty, and Income Inequality in Developing Asia   |   3 \ncost of usage).2  Each measure is normalized, statistically identified for each dimension, and then \naggregated using statistical weights. The aggregation technique follows weighted geometric mean.  A \ndrawback from this approach is that it uses factor analysis method to determine which variables are to \nbe included for each dimension. Therefore, it does not fully utilize all available data for each country.  \nFurthermore, it assigns various weights for each dimension, which implies the importance of one \nmeasure versus another. \n \nSarma (2008) follows a different approach to construct the indicator. He first computed a \ndimension index for each dimension of financial inclusion and then aggregated each index as the \nnormalized inverse of Euclidean distance, where the distance is computed from a reference ideal point, \nand then normalized by the number of dimensions included in the aggregate index. The advantage of \nthis approach is its ease of computation and it does not impose varying weights for each dimension.  \nFor this reasons, this paper closely follows Sarma\u2019s (2008) approach. \n \nPrevious studies have also looked into the impact of financial inclusion on poverty and income \ninequality. Burgess and Pande (2005) found that state-led expansion of rural bank branches in India \nhas  helped  reduce  poverty.  Specifically,  the  authors  found  robust  evidence  that  opening  bank \nbranches in rural unbanked locations in India was associated with reduction in rural poverty rates in \nthose areas. Similarly, Brune et al. (2011) found that increased financial access through commitment \nsaving account in rural Malawi improves the well-being of poor households as it provides access to \ntheir savings for agricultural input use. Allen et al. (2013) found that by tapping underprivileged \nhouseholds, commercial banks can help improve financial access of the poor in Kenya. \n \nUnlike  Amid\u017ei\u0107,  Massara,  and  Mialou  (2014)  and  Sarma  (2008),  Honohan  (2008) \nconstructed a financial access indicator for 160 economies that combines both household survey \ndatasets and published financial institutions data into a composite indicator; and assessed country \ncharacteristics that might influence financial access. Among the variables tested, aid as percent of \ngross national income (GNI), age dependency ratio, and population density significantly lower financial \naccess; while mobile phone subscription and quality of institutions significantly increase financial \naccess. Looking at the cross-country link between poverty and financial access, his results show that \nfinancial access significantly reduces poverty, but the result is valid only when financial access is the \nsole regressor, i.e., it loses significance when other variables are added as regressors.  \n \nIn an earlier version of his paper, Honohan (2007) tested the significance of his financial \naccess indictor in reducing income equality. His results show that higher financial access significantly \nreduces income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. However, the link between the two \nvariables depends on which specification is used, i.e., when the access variable is included on its own \nand/or includes financial depth measure, the results are significant, but the same does not hold when \nper capita income and dummy variables are included. \n \nRojas-Suarez (2010) used the same indicator constructed by Honohan (2008) to test the \nsignificance of various macroeconomic and country characteristics for a group of emerging economies, \nincluding some from developing Asia. The results show that economic volatility, weak rule of law, \nhigher income inequality, and social underdevelopment and regulatory constraints significantly lower \nfinancial  access.  In  addition,  various  country  grouping  dummy  variables  were  also  found  to  be \nsignificant especially for large emerging economies. However, unlike the estimation of Honohan, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2   Although Amid\u017ei\u0107, Massara, and Mialou (2014) defined proxies for quality measure, they did not include it in their \ncomposite indicator due to lack of reliable and available data.  ", "4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 426 \nRojas-Suarez (2010) used weighted least squares estimation to account for heteroskedasticity in their \nsample. \n \n \nIII.  FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDICATOR \n \nBefore  testing  the  significance  of  financial  inclusion  in  reducing  poverty  and  lowering  income \ninequality in developing Asia, we first construct our own financial inclusion indicator. The motivations \nfor constructing our own financial inclusion indicator are as follows: 1) we need to include as many \ndeveloping Asian economies in our sample; using previously computed indicator will limit our sample \nsize, which can lead to biased results; 2) there is a need to develop a consistent measure of financial \ninclusion  for  a  large  sample  of  economies,  which  will  be  used  to  standardize  the  measure  for \ndeveloping Asia; and 3) we can compare our own financial inclusion indicator with previous measures. \n \nWe closely follow the methodology of Sarma (2008) in constructing our financial inclusion \nindicator.  Specifically,  we  include  five  measures  namely,  automated  teller  machines  (ATM)  per \n100,000 adults, commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults, borrowers from commercial banks per \n1,000 adults, depositors with commercial banks per 1,000 adults, and domestic credit to GDP ratio. \nThe first two measures pertain to availability of banking services as a dimension of financial inclusion, \nwhile the last three refers to the usage dimension of financial inclusion. All indicators are sourced from \nthe World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators, and each indicator for each economy pertains to the \naverage value from 2004 to 2012. We chose to use period average values, instead of focusing on a \nparticular year, to avoid annual fluctuations and to include as many economies as possible. In total, \ndata for 188 economies are downloaded, including those from developing Asia. \n \nAfter computing the period average for each financial inclusion indicator for 188 economies, \nwe  then  calculate  the  dimension  index,  following  the  specification  of  Sarma  (2008),  where  the \ndimension index for ith dimension d is derived as: \ni\n \n(cid:1856) (cid:3404)\t (cid:3002)(cid:3284)(cid:2879)(cid:3040)(cid:3284)\u00a0                                                                              (1) \n(cid:3036)\n(cid:3014)(cid:3284)(cid:2879)\t(cid:3040)(cid:3284)\n \nwhere A is the actual value of dimension i, m is the minimum value of dimension i, M is the maximum \ni i i\nvalue of dimension i. The index of financial inclusion for country i is then measured by the normalized \ninverse of Euclidean distance of point d computed in Equation (1) from the ideal point I which is equal \ni\nto 1. Specifically, the formula is given by: \n \n(cid:1832)(cid:1835)(cid:1835) (cid:3404) 1(cid:3398)\t(cid:3493)(cid:4666)(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3031)(cid:3117)(cid:4667)(cid:3118)(cid:2878)(cid:4666)(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3031)(cid:3118)(cid:4667)(cid:3118)(cid:2878)\t\u2026(cid:4666)(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3031)(cid:3289)(cid:4667)(cid:3118)\u00a0         (2) \n(cid:3036)\n\u221a(cid:3041)\n \nwhere the second term of the numerator in Equation (2) is the Euclidean distance from an ideal point, \nnormalizing it by the square root of the number of observations and subtracting it by 1, giving the \ninverse normalized distance. We normalized the indicator in order to make the computed values lie \nbetween 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to the highest financial inclusion index and 0 is the lowest, \nfollowing Sarma (2008). \n \nOne difference between our measure with Sarma\u2019s (2008) indicator is that we include all \navailable data regardless of dimension. In Sarma\u2019s (2008) index, domestic credit and domestic deposit \nare included as measures of usage dimension. In our index, we include borrowers and depositors on ", "Financial Inclusion, Poverty, and Income Inequality in Developing Asia   |   5 \ncommercial banks, along with domestic credit (% of GDP) as a measure of usage. The main reason for \nthis is to increase our sample size. If we restrict our variables to those used by Sarma (2008), we will \nhave smaller sample size. Using the above-mentioned five measures make our indicator more precise \nas it utilizes all available information. \n \nTable 1 presents our computed financial inclusion indicator. Several observations are noted. \nFirst,  advanced  countries  tend  to  have  higher  financial  inclusion  than  emerging  and  developing \neconomies. This observation is similar to those of Honohan (2008) and Sarma (2008). In fact, our \nranking is highly consistent with those of Sarma\u2019s (2008). Second, interestingly, some small economies \nhave very high financial inclusion indicators despite being developing economies. For instance, St. Kitts \nand Nevis, the Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, and Grenada are included in the top one-third \nof the ranking table, maybe due to fact that these countries are offshore financial centers. Third, our \ncomputed financial inclusion indicator follows the same pattern as those of Honohan (2008) and \nSarma (2008). Figure 1 shows the comparison with Honohan\u2019s (2008) indicator, and Figure 2 for \nSarma\u2019s (2008) measure. Both figures imply that for economies where we calculated a high (low) \nfinancial inclusion indicator, both Honohan (2008) and Sarma (2008) also computed a high (low) \nfinancial inclusion, suggesting a similar pattern between various measures. Lastly, across developing \nAsia, there is a variation on the level of financial inclusion. Figure 3 illustrates that some economies in \nAsia have very high financial inclusion, while others have very low. The median level of financial \ninclusion is 24. Surprisingly, some developing economies in Asia have higher-than-expected financial \ninclusion indicator, such as Mongolia, Fiji, the Maldives, Uzbekistan, and Samoa. \n \n   ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 426 \nTable 1: Financial Inclusion Index \n \nEconomy  FII  Rank  Economy  FII  Rank  Economy  FII  Rank \nBosnia and \nSpain  90.98  1  Brazil  53.66  30  Herzegovina  39.90  59 \nPortugal  81.97  2  Bahamas, The  52.90  31  Mauritius  39.70  60 \nLuxembourg  81.96  3  Antigua and Barbuda  52.69  32  Seychelles  39.68  61 \nUnited States  80.10  4  Brunei Darussalam  52.30  33  Cabo Verde  39.13  62 \nIceland  79.72  5  Latvia  51.68  34  Romania  38.94  63 \nJapan  78.32  6  Chile  51.08  35  Serbia  37.74  64 \nCanada  74.90  7  Lebanon  50.83  36  Lithuania  37.70  65 \nSwitzerland  74.41  8  Hong Kong, China  50.76  37  Barbados  37.66  66 \nBelgium  70.70  9  Turkey  50.64  38  Poland  37.35  67 \nAustralia  69.48  10  Hungary  50.59  39  Jordan  37.11  68 \nUnited Kingdom  68.95  11  Aruba  47.39  40  Costa Rica  37.09  69 \nKorea, Rep. of  68.89  12  Malaysia  47.09  41  Slovak Republic  36.62  70 \nDenmark  68.30  13  Oman  46.42  42  Colombia  35.14  71 \nItaly  67.48  14  Ukraine  46.26  43  Uruguay  34.21  72 \nIreland  66.99  15  Sweden  45.96  44  Fiji  34.00  73 \nSt. Kitts and Nevis  65.93  16  Thailand  45.59  45  Maldives  33.70  74 \nCroatia  64.87  17  Grenada  44.78  46  Czech Republic  33.67  75 \nFrance  63.51  18  Finland  44.03  47  Dominica  33.04  76 \nUnited Arab \nEstonia  61.96  19  Mongolia  44.02  48  Emirates  32.60  77 \nBulgaria  59.71  20  South Africa  43.61  49  Ecuador  32.33  78 \nIsrael  58.97  21  Montenegro  43.31  50  Suriname  32.18  79 \nGreece  58.73  22  Russian Federation  43.22  51  Macedonia, Rep. of  31.03  80 \nNew Zealand  58.73  23  Panama  43.00  52  Uzbekistan  30.99  81 \nNetherlands  58.27  24  Norway  42.35  53  Morocco  30.86  82 \nSingapore  58.24  25  Belize  42.27  54  Argentina  30.85  83 \nChina, People\u2019s \nSlovenia  57.64  26  Kuwait  42.01  55  Rep. of  30.22  84 \nGermany  55.90  27  St. Lucia  40.87  56  Samoa  29.86  85 \nSt. Vincent and the \nMalta  55.63  28  Qatar  40.60  57  Grenadines  29.80  86 \nAustria  53.91  29  Kosovo  40.46  58  Guatemala  29.56  87 \ncontinued on next page", "Financial Inclusion, Poverty, and Income Inequality in Developing Asia   |   7 \nTable 1   continued \nEconomy  FII  Rank  Economy  FII  Rank  Economy  FII  Rank \nTunisia  29.29  88  Sri Lanka  20.17  118  Kyrgyz Republic  7.58  148 \nIran, Islamic Rep. of  28.43  89  Guyana  19.66  119  Guinea  7.56  149 \nVenezuela, RB  28.37  90  Philippines  19.63  120  Angola  7.04  150 \nKazakhstan  27.95  91  West Bank and Gaza  19.50  121  Cote d'Ivoire  6.99  151 \nGeorgia  27.57  92  Egypt, Arab Rep.  18.77  122  Gabon  6.82  152 \nTonga  27.49  93  Swaziland  18.33  123  Ethiopia  6.76  153 \nMexico  27.26  94  Bolivia  18.10  124  Malawi  6.54  154 \nVanuatu  27.12  95  Bangladesh  16.75  125  Cambodia  6.42  155 \nDominican Republic  26.95  96  Nicaragua  16.68  126  Djibouti  6.05  156 \nAlbania  25.69  97  Belarus  15.97  127  Sudan  5.74  157 \nHonduras  25.50  98  Azerbaijan  15.54  128  Mali  5.49  158 \nEl Salvador  25.15  99  Gambia, The  15.27  129  Mozambique  5.34  159 \nPeru  24.87  100  Bhutan  14.91  130  Benin  5.31  160 \nMyanmar  24.85  101  Paraguay  14.51  131  Zambia  5.08  161 \nIndonesia  24.36  102  Nepal  14.46  132  Timor-Leste  5.06  162 \nSaudi Arabia  24.34  103  Kenya  13.42  133  Tanzania  5.01  163 \nIndia  24.14  104  Pakistan  12.40  134  Equatorial Guinea  4.90  164 \nMoldova  24.00  105  Nigeria  11.92  135  Uganda  4.82  165 \nArmenia  23.81  106  Solomon Islands  11.56  136  Sierra Leone  4.35  166 \nBotswana  23.60  107  Zimbabwe  11.50  137  Lao PDR  4.22  167 \nLiberia  22.79  108  Syrian Arab Republic  11.08  138  Burundi  4.02  168 \nLibya  22.59  109  Mauritania  10.90  139  Rwanda  3.97  169 \nTrinidad and Tobago  22.03  110  Ghana  10.23  140  Yemen, Rep. of  3.93  170 \nAfghanistan  21.95  111  Algeria  9.62  141  Comoros  3.61  171 \nCentral African \nViet Nam  21.28  112  Tajikistan  9.36  142  Republic  2.83  172 \nCongo, Dem.

EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCES \n \nIn order to answer the main research questions in this paper, we ran three regression models. First, we \ntest which factors significantly increase or decrease financial inclusion in developing Asia. Using the \ncomputed financial inclusion indicator for 37 developing Asian economies presented in the previous \nsection, we use its log value as the dependent variable and test the significance of various regressors, \nfollowing Honohan\u2019s (2008) regressors.  \n \nWe test the significance of per capita income and argue that higher per capita income should \nincrease financial inclusion as those with insufficient income and high risk profile will no longer be \nexcluded from financial services (Figure 4). Better rule of law should also increase financial inclusion as \nit improves enforcement of financial contracts (Figure 5). Higher age dependency ratio should reduce \nfinancial inclusion as a larger segment of the population are either too young or above the retirement \nage which impedes their access to financial services as they do not earn income (Figure 6). In contrast, \na larger population should increase financial access as it indicates a larger market size. Higher primary \nschool completion and literacy rates should also lead to higher access to financial services (Figure 7). A \ndummy variable for low-income economy is also included to control for small developing economies in \nthe region. \n \n   ", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 426 \nFigure 4: Per Capita Income and Financial Inclusion \n \n2\nKOR SIN\nTHA BRU\nMAL\nx MON HKG\ne MLD\nn ind 1.5 UZBINDMYA GEOVSAANMPTROCN FKIJAZ\nusio AFG VIE INSROI ARM\ncl BAN PHI\nal in NEP PAK BHU AZE\nanci 1 TAJ SOL\nFin KGZ PNG KIR\nCAM\nTIM\nLAO\n.5\n2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5\nPer capita income\nFitted values m\ufb01i  \nmfii = modified financial inclusion index. \nNote: See footnote 1 for the definition of the codes. \nSources: Authors\u2019 calculations and World Bank, World Development Indicators.\n \nFigure 5: Rule of Law and Financial Inclusion\n \n2\nKOR\nSIN\nTHA MBARLU HKG\nx MON\ne\nn ind 1.5 UZB KAZ FIPJRGCEOMLD TONVAN SAM\no MYA INO ARM IND\nusi AFG PHVIIE SRI\ncl BAN\ncial in PAANSZKEOEPL BHU\nan 1 TAJ\nFin KGZ PNG KIR\nCAM\nTIM\nLAO\n.5\n0 1 2 3 4\nRule of law\nFitted values m\ufb01i  \nmfii = modified financial inclusion index. \nNote: See footnote 1 for the definition of the codes. \nSources: Authors\u2019 calculations and World Bank, World Governance Indicators. \n \n   ", "Financial Inclusion, Poverty, and Income Inequality in Developing Asia   |   11 \nFigure 6: Age Dependency Ratio and Financial Inclusion \n \n2\nKOR\nSIN\nHKG BRU\nTHA MAL\nx MON\ne\nd FIJ MLD\nusion in 1.5 PRC MVKYIEAAZ AGRSERMOIINOUIZNBD PHVIAN TSOANM AFG\ncl BAN\ncial in AZE BHU PAK NEPSOL\nan 1 TAJ\nFin KGZ KIR PNG\nCAM\nTIM\nLAO\n.5\n1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2\nAge dependency ratio\nFitted values m\ufb01i  \nmfii = modified financial inclusion index. \nNote: See footnote 1 for the definition of the codes. \nSources: Authors\u2019 calculations and World Bank, World Development Indicators.\n \nFigure 7: Primary School Completion and Financial Inclusion \n \n2\nKOR\nSIN\nHKGBRU\nx THA MAL MON\nde UZB FIJ MLD\nn in1.5 VANPRC GEKTSOAAOZMN\no MYA AIINNRMDO\nusi AFG PHI SVRIIE\nncial incl 1 PBAAKN BHNUSEOPLAZTEAJ\nna PNG KGZ KIR\nFi CAM\nTIM\nLAO\n.5\n1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2\nPrimary education completion rate\nFitted values m\ufb01i  \nmfii = modified financial inclusion index. \nNote: See footnote 1 for the definition of the codes. \nSources: Authors\u2019 calculations and World Bank, World Development Indicators.\n \nAfter testing the significance of above-mentioned indicators on financial access, we examine \nthe significance of financial inclusion in reducing poverty rates, along with various indicators. We \nexpect that as financial inclusion increases, poverty rates should decline as more people have access to \nfinancial services to smooth their consumption and engage in productive activities. Figure 8 illustrates ", "12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 426 \nthis negative relationship between poverty rates and financial inclusion. Aside from poverty rate, \nseveral indicators are also considered. 1) Ratio of highest to lowest 20% income group to account for \nincome inequality. 2) Inflation as a measure of macroeconomic stability or an indicator of wealth \ndistribution between debtor and creditor. 3) Primary school completion ratio, which tends to reduce \npoverty rates.  4) Growth in bank claims, which measures financial depth.  We also control for small \ndeveloping economies through dummy variables. In addition, we include growth rates, rule of law, and \nan interaction term between per capita income and financial inclusion in some specifications.  \n \nFigure 8: Financial Inclusion and Poverty\n \n2\nTIM TAJ\n) PNG\nonal 1.5 CAM KGZ BAN AFAIGNRDMPRCFIJ MON\nate (Nati LAO KIR SOLPAKNBEHPU PHVIIEIMNYOTGKAOEASUOANZZMB THAHKGSINKOR\ny r SRI VANMLD\nert 1 AZE\nv\no\nP\nMAL\n.5\n.5 1 1.5 2\nFinancial inclusion index\nFitted values poverty  \n \nNote: See footnote 1 for the definition of the codes. \nSources: Authors\u2019 calculations and World Bank, World Development Indicators.\n \nFinally, we test the significance of financial inclusion and other variables on income inequality. \nWe expect that as financial inclusion increases, income inequality should decline as more people at the \nlower  income  strata  will  have  access  to  financial  services.

The estimates \nreveal that when both per capita income and rule of law are considered, the latter loses its significance, \nsuggesting that per capita income is the main determinant for financial inclusion in developing Asia \nand that involuntary financial exclusion in the region may be driven largely by insufficient household \nincome and high risk profile rather than market failures and weak enforcement of contracts. These \nresults  are  consistent  with  the  findings  of  Honohan  (2008).  However,  unlike  the  estimates  of \nHonohan (2008), we find robust evidence showing the importance of per capita income on financial \ninclusion. But similar to Honohan\u2019s (2008) results, primary education completion and literacy rates \nhave no significant effect on the level of financial inclusion in developing Asia. \n \nTable 3 shows the results on the impact of financial access on poverty.

SUMMARY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n \nIn order to test whether financial inclusion helps reduce poverty and income inequality in developing \nAsia, we constructed our own financial inclusion indicator for 37 economies in the region using various \ndimensions of financial inclusion, e.g., availability and usage. We closely follow the methodology of \nSarma (2008), although we utilized more data in our indicator. Our financial inclusion indicator shows \na similar pattern (in terms) of ranking as those of Honohan (2008) and Sarma (2008). We then tested \nwhich factors significantly influence financial inclusion indicator in developing Asia. Our estimates \nshow the importance of per capita income, rule of law, and demographic factors.  Next, we test \nwhether or not financial inclusion in the region helps reduce poverty and income inequality. Our \nfindings clearly show a robust and significant correlation between higher financial inclusion and lower \npoverty and income inequality. The findings are robust using Honohan\u2019s (2008) financial access \nindicator. Based on our empirical results, we offer several policy implications. \n \nFirst, demographic characteristics of economies in developing Asia significantly influence the \nlevel of financial inclusion. Economies with large population sizes tend to have greater access to \nfinancial services, while those with high dependency ratios have lower access to financial services. \nThese have important policy implications, especially for economies that have rapidly aging population \nstructures. For these economies, the provision of retirement pensions and other old-age benefits \nwould be crucial in broadening access to financial services of old-age population. \n \nSecond, similar to the findings of Honohan (2008) and Rojas-Suarez (2010), good governance \nand high institutional quality significantly increase financial inclusion. This implies that to broaden \nfinancial access, economies- in developing Asia must continue to improve the quality of its governance \nand institutions, specifically through strengthening the rule of law, including enforcement of financial \ncontracts and financial regulatory oversight. Maintaining high quality rule of law will reduce involuntary \nfinancial exclusion of large segments of the population.  \n \nThird, our estimates offer evidence of a strong correlation between financial access and \npoverty rates. To reduce poverty rates in the region, policymakers must implement policies that will \naddress  impediments  to  financial  inclusion.  In  this  regard,  promoting  inclusive  growth  must \ncomplement efforts to increase financial inclusion. Of growing importance is the role of microfinance.  \nAvailability of credit to lower income groups improves their access to financial services, which in turn \nenables them to undertake productive activities and smoothen their consumption in the face of short-\nterm adverse shocks. \n \nFinally, our estimates provide some evidence on the role of financial inclusion on income \ninequality.  Increasing financial inclusion or reducing involuntary financial exclusion lowers income \ninequality in developing Asia. To further reduce income inequality, more measures must be taken to \naddress financial exclusion of low-income groups from financial services. In this context, programs that \nwill help alleviate poverty will likewise address growing income inequality in the region.  \n \n \n ", "\u00a0\nREFERENCES \n \nAllen, F. E. Carletti, R. Cull, J.
