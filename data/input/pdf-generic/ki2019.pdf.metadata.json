In July 1969, Key Indicators of Developing \nMember Countries of ADB was first published as an internal reference document, providing \ndata on each of the 17 developing economies that were ADB members at the time.\nJust as we have seen many changes across our region over half a century, Key Indicators \nfor  Asia  and  the  Pacific  has  reflected  these  changes.  Today,  the  publication  contains  a \ncomprehensive set of economic, social, and environmental statistics, including indicators \nof the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Covering the 49 regional members of ADB, \nKey Indicators for Asia and the Pacific now reaches out to a broad audience that includes \npolicymakers, development practitioners, government officials, researchers, students, and \nthe general public. Beginning this year, the publication\u2019s vitally important data will also be \naccessible in a user-friendly digitized format. \nData in this 2019 edition of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific\u2014prepared for the first \ntime by ADB\u2019s newly formed Statistics and Data Innovation Unit\u2014show that development \nacross Asia and the Pacific has been impressive on many fronts. The number of people in \nour region living in extreme poverty declined from 1.1 billion in 2002 to 264 million in 2015. \nThe maternal mortality ratio was halved in the period from 2000 to 2015, and an average of \nabout 90% of children were enrolled in primary school in 2017. The region\u2019s share of global \ngross domestic product (in current United States dollars) surpassed one-third in 2018, while \ninternational trade has become a growing source of regional integration, as economies across \nAsia and the Pacific strengthen, broaden, and diversify their participation in global value \nchains.\nWhile the region has done remarkably well, the indicators presented here also remind \nus of the many challenges that lie ahead. Economic growth throughout Asia and the Pacific \nhas generally been accompanied by a rise in carbon dioxide emissions; cities are affected by \nair pollution; and, in some economies, more than half the urban population is living in slums \nor informal settlements. The proportion of elderly people in the total population reached \nan average of 8.6% across all ADB regional members in 2018, while the number of women \nparticipating in national parliaments is below gender parity. The SDG indicators highlight the \nneed to expand access to safe water and sanitation facilities, and to ensure that all people have \nsafe, nutritious, and sufficient food to eat all year round.\nEffective governance depends on accurate and timely data to support evidence-based \npolicymaking. This requires investment in data development and statistical capacity building. \nThe special supplement to Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2019 presents results from \none such capacity-building initiative by ADB. It provides a quantitative assessment of the \nbenefits of using handheld digital devices for survey data collection and management, with \nthe traditional pen and paper interviewing method as a basis for comparison.", "xiv Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2019\nIn the 50th year of this publication, ADB again acknowledges the ongoing relationships \nwith statistical partners in our regional member economies, who provide us with the most \nrecent data from their official sources. We are also indebted to those international agencies \nfrom which the data in many of the publication\u2019s tables are sourced. We hope that Key Indicators \nfor Asia and the Pacific will remain a valuable resource for data on major development issues \nwell into the future. As always, we welcome feedback from our users on both the content and \nstructure of the publication.\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident\nAsian Development Bank", "xv\nAcknowledgments\nThis 50th edition of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2019 was prepared by the newly \nestablished Statistics and Data Innovation Unit (EROD-SDI) within the Economic Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) at the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

It can be used to describe the evolving dynamics of \nproduction networks within Asia and the Pacific. \n\u2022  The share of domestic value-added flowing to and from Asia increased from 2000 to 2018, highlighting \nthe increasing role of the region as a source of, and destination for, domestic value-added. Meanwhile, \nAsia\u2019s connection to North America, as measured by domestic value-added flows, had diminished  \nby 2018.\n\u2022  Intraregional trade matters for Asia, with the region retaining up to 33.5% of its generated domestic \nvalue-added within its own economies in 2018. This share of intraregional outflows is equivalent to \n39.0% of total value-added inflows to Asia.  \n\u2022  While dynamics vary by sector, by 2018, the People\u2019s Republic of China had surpassed other subregions \nand individual economies as Asia\u2019s source hub for intraregional domestic value-added outflows when \nconsidering all sectors.

Deforested areas do not include areas logged but intended for regeneration \nor areas degraded by fuel-wood gathering, acid precipitation, or forest fires. A negative \nrate indicates reforestation or increase in forest area.\nPollution\nCarbon Dioxide Emissions Carbon dioxide emissions, largely by-products of energy production and use, account \nfor the largest share of greenhouse gases, which are associated with global warming. \nAnthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions result primarily from fossil fuel combustion \nand cement manufacturing. In combustion, different fossil fuels release different \namounts of carbon dioxide for the same level of energy used: oil releases about 50% \nmore carbon dioxide than natural gas, while coal releases about twice as much. Cement \nmanufacturing releases about half a metric ton of carbon dioxide for each metric ton of \ncement produced. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning \nof fossil fuels and cement manufacture but excludes emissions from land use such as \ndeforestation. \nNitrous Oxide Emissions Nitrous oxide emissions are mainly from fossil fuel combustion, fertilizers, rainforest \nfires, and animal waste. Nitrous oxide is a powerful greenhouse gas, with an estimated \natmospheric lifetime of 114 years, compared with 12 years for methane. The per-\nkilogram global warming potential of nitrous oxide is nearly 310 times that of carbon \ndioxide within 100 years.\nMethane Emissions Methane emissions are those stemming from human activities such as agriculture and \nfrom industrial methane production.

General government units have four types \nof revenue: (i) compulsory levies in the form of taxes and certain types of social \ncontributions; (ii) property income derived from the ownership of assets; (iii) sales of \ngoods and services; and (iv) other transfers receivable from other units.\nFor economies following the IMF\u2019s Government Finance Statistics 1986 framework, total \nrevenue (including grants) consists of current and capital revenues.
