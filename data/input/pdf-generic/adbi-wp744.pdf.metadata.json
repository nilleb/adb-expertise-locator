INTRODUCTION \nThe various international and regional institutions that have been engaged in the work \non issues related to trade in digital economy has to a certain extent directed their \nefforts following the mantra of \u201ctrade facilitation\u201d. Some of those efforts have supported \nthe  implementation  of national  and  regional single  windows  across  jurisdictions  to  \nfulfil import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. Interoperability and \ninternationalization of national single windows is the next logical step, as it will allow \ncollaborative information sharing for both public and private sector stakeholders in \nglobal  supply  chains. The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  review  the  legal  framework \nnecessary for implementing an international single window environment (ISWE) and,  \nin  that  context,  examine  particular  economic  and  financial  aspects  of  the  current \ndevelopments. The past and on-going efforts of some of the relevant international  \nand regional institutions1 are examined in contextual detail to provide a legal basis  \nfor integration of national single windows (NSW) through ISWE. The focus of the \ndiscussion is on the necessity for creating ISWE and how it may direct policymaking to \nrespond to global challenges such as participation and financing of small and medium \nenterprises (SMEs) in international supply chains. \nWith the progressive ratification of the WTO\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA),2 \nseveral  WTO  Member  States  are  likely  to  move  to  the  broader  use  of  electronic \ntransactions  through  use  of  information  and  communications  technologies  (ICT)  \nto  meet  their  multilateral  treaty  obligations.  For  example,  the  TFA  suggests  that \nmember-states should implement NSW and recommend the use of ICT methods for \ntrade. The paper considers the contribution of the TFA and suggests that once majority \nof  the  WTO  Member  States  establish  single  windows,  most  of  the  necessary \ninfrastructure for creating ISWE would be present. In this context the contribution of \nother international institutions such as, WCO, UN/CEFACT, UN/ESCAP, UNCITRAL, \nUNNExT, etc., to develop the supplementary legal framework is discussed.  \nSince 2005, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been working to \ndevelop both the technical and legal frameworks for a regional Single Window referred \nto as the ASEAN Single Window (ASW). This paper discusses the ASW initiative to \nidentify prospects and challenges that may be relevant for creating ISWE. During the \npast several months ASW has supported electronic exchange of customs declaration \nand certificate of origin between five Member States on a pilot basis. ASW is utilised  \nto highlight the discussions on legal and economic viability of interoperability. The \ninitiative  is  examined  from  transaction  cost  and  information  asymmetry  theory \nperspectives to provide a methodology for conducting empirical analysis at country-\nlevel. The analysis allows to draw conclusions about aggregate impact of ASW\u2019s early \nimplementation on trade among ASEAN Member States.3 \n                                                 \n1  The  efforts  of  institutions  considered  are  the  United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe \n(UNECE), United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN/ESCAP), \nUnited Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), United Nations \nNetwork of Experts for Paperless Trade and Transport Facilitation in Asia and the Pacific (UNNExT), \nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), World Customs Organization \n(WCO) and World Trade Organization (WTO).  \n2  WTO. 2013. Trade Facilitation Agreement (WT/MIN(13)/36 or WT/L/911) https://www.wto.org/english/ \nthewto_e/minist_e/mc9_e/desci36_e.htm (accessed 14 April 2017) The Agreement entered into force \non 22 February 2017 after obtaining two-thirds acceptance from WTO\u2019s 164 members. \n3  It is to be noted that the ASW is conducting live operations on a pilot basis. Therefore, the interpretation \nof the empirical findings should not be related to the fully operating single window. The period analyzed \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 744  Bal, Rajput, and Alizada \n \nBuilding upon the findings from the ASW experience the paper emphasises that full \npotential of ISWE can be realised through integration of Government-to-Government \n(G2G), Business-to-Government (B2G) and Business-to-Business (B2B) information. \nSuch integration of information into an interoperable environment will allow flow of real-\ntime data that can offer numerous possibilities to enhance the visibility of international \nsupply chains. It is argued that single window integration at international level should \ninclude transport and related commercial requirements in order to improve information \nflows among all supply chain actors. \nThe inclusion of the transport stakeholders into the single window system would require \ncomplex  coordination  that  can  capture  the  existing  relationships  between  carrier \ninterests, shipper interests, ports, transport authorities, insurance providers, etc., from \nlegal  and  technical  perspectives.  Emergence  of  new  technology  has  opened  up  \nthe  possibilities  for  creating  technical  solutions  for  such  complex  arrangements. \nNevertheless, lack of enabling national laws on transport and e-commerce in most \njurisdictions may pose as a challenge. \nTo illustrate the legal complexity from transport law and e-commerce law perspectives \nthe existing situation with electronic bills of lading is briefly examined. The bill of lading, \nin addition to being the transport document issued by the carrier to the shipper, serves \nessential trade functions for the consignor, consignee and banks. The paper explores \nways through which the legal concept of a bill of lading can be dematerialised. In this \ncontext,  the  selected  provisions  of  the  Rotterdam  Rules  and  the  Model  Law  on \nElectronic Transferable Records is examined through the lens of recent developments \nbrought through automation in trade and evolving technologies such as distributed \nledger and cloud computing. \nThe  paper  discusses  the  necessity  for  ISWE  to  channelize  the  dematerialised \ninformation of a bill of lading to fulfil the trade functions in an electronic business \nenvironment. In this context the emergence of trade financing techniques such as bank \npayment obligation (BPO) and supply chain finance (SCF) are discussed to highlight \nthat an ISWE is desirable for creating a level playing field for SMEs participating in \nglobal supply chains.  \n2.  TRADE FACILITATION \nOver the last several years, numerous multilateral and regional institutions have been \nengaged in law-making initiatives related to e-commerce, paperless trade, electronic \nsingle window, and cross-border e-transaction and commercial law matters. Most of \nthese initiatives feature under the broad heading of trade facilitation.  \nTrade  facilitation  initiatives  are  commonly  considered  to  create  standards  and \nguidelines  for  the  exchange  of  goods  and  services  across  borders.4 Commercial \naspects of trade have also been considered within the ambit of trade facilitation by \ncertain institutions.  \n   \n                                                                                                                                            \nin this study is significantly short. Therefore, this effect should be interpreted as short-run effect of ASW \non exports. \n4  See the definitions of trade facilitation as used by institutions such as WTO, UN/CEFACT and WCO. \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 744  Bal, Rajput, and Alizada \n \nWTO defines trade facilitation as: \nthe simplification and harmonization of international trade procedures, \nwhere  trade  procedures  are  the  activities,  practices  and  formalities \ninvolved in collecting, presenting, communicating and processing data \nand other information required for the movement of goods in international \ntrade.5 \nUN/CEFACT defines trade facilitation as: \nthe simplification, standardization, and harmonization of procedures and \nassociated information flows required to move goods from seller to buyer \nand to make payments.6 \nOECD defines trade facilitation as:  \nthe  simplification  and  standardization  of  procedures  and  associated \ninformation flows required to move goods internationally from seller to \nbuyer and to pass payments in the other direction.7 \nThe above-mentioned definitions are particularly interesting because they emphasise \non the flow of information connected with the physical movement of goods.8 This flow \nof information, which can be enhanced through digitalization of trade processes, help \nbusinesses and governmental agencies to manage risks and reduce transaction costs. \nThere exist a positive correlation between digitalization and economic growth.9 An \nimportant practical tool for coordinating trade processes10 and procedures at the border \nto ensure smooth flow of information is an electronic single window facility. \nSingle window is defined by the WCO as: \nAn intelligent facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to \nlodge standardized information and documents with a single entry point to \nfulfil all import, export and transit related regulatory requirements.11  \n \n                                                 \n5  WTO, A Training Package: What is Trade Facilitation? www.gfptt.org/sites/default/files/refread/Training-\nguide-final.pdf (accessed 14 April 2017). \n6  UNECE,  Trade  Facilitation  Implementation  Guide.  http://tfig.unece.org/details.html  (accessed  \n14 April 2017). \n7  OECD.  2005.The  Costs  and  benefits  of  Trade  Facilitation.  http://www.oecd.org/trade/facilitation/ \n35459690.pdf (accessed 14 April 2017). \n8  A typical international supply chain features the physical movement of goods, the financial aspects of \nthe transaction, and the flow of information within the various actors in the supply chain. The three \nlayers exist as parallel processes with limited interaction between them. However, the use of ICT may \nenhance interaction between the three layers. Basu Bal, A., Rajput, T. 2015.

Some examples of \nnational single window systems are International Trade Data System (ITDS) of the US, \nUNI-PASS Customs system and KTNET national trade single window of the Republic \nof Korea, TradeXchange of Singapore and PortNet of Finland.  \n3.  TFA CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS CREATING ISWE  \nOne interesting aspect that emerges from evaluating the single window reform across \ncountries  is  that  implementation  is  fragmented  than  desired.15 Such  fragmentation \ncreated the need for a comprehensive trade facilitation reform which would consolidate \nand multilateralize the commitments of States to create efficient trading processes and \nprocedures at the borders.16 The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA),17 which is the \nresult of the Bali Ministerial Conference in December 2013,18 is a step in that direction. \nOnce the TFA is fully implemented, it will result in an environment where WTO Member \n                                                 \n12  UN/CEFACT.  2005.

Article 10 of the TFA mandates that \nall Members of the WTO shall endeavour to establish and maintain a single window \nenabling  traders  to  submit  documentation  for  export,  import  and  transit  of  goods \nthrough a single entry point. It is important to mention that the implementation of a \nsingle window system develops on the GATT 1994 Article VIII concerning Fees and \nFormalities  connected  with  the  importation  and  exportation,  where  paragraph  1(c) \nrecognizes \u201cthe need for minimizing the incidence and complexity of import and export \nformalities  and  for  decreasing  and  simplifying  import  and  export  documentation \nrequirement\u201d. The single window system under the TFA has to be implemented by the \nMembers of the WTO thereby allowing traders to lodge information with a single body \nfor the purposes of all import or export related regulatory requirements. This system \nseeks  to  ensure  that  all  procedures,  data  and  requirements  related  to  the  trade \ntransaction is handled and overseen by one agency which takes the responsibility of \ncombined controls. In addition to making the procedural requirements for the traders \nsimple and standardized, this system facilitates information flows enhancing efficiency.  \nIt is submitted that the implementation of TFA by 164 Members will establish single \nwindows (to facilitate import, export and transit-related regulatory functions) across \njurisdictions that will establish the infrastructure for the ISWE. The concept of the ISWE \nsimply  stated  refers  to  an  environment  which  is  characterized  by \ninteroperability 19 between  various  national  single  windows.  The  interoperable \nenvironment reflects the position where national single windows communicate with \neach other to exchange relevant information. In practice the discussion on ISWE must \nbegin with the deliberation on different technological and organizational models for \nmaking interoperability possible. After surveying existing literature it is revealed that \ntwo models are proposed for the design of interoperability, namely centralised server \nmodel 20 and  gateway  model. 21 More  recently,  cloud  computing  has  also  been \nsuggested  as  a  way  forward  to  build  a  supranational  single  window. 22  The \ntechnological framework that is selected for the creation of the ISWE framework may \nentail distinct legal and political deliberations. If a centralised server model is adopted \nfor ISWE then a central server may be used to host a gateway which will facilitate the \ntrade data exchange. This model seems simple from a practical perspective but it \nposes problematic political questions. One such question is which Member State will \nhost and be responsible for the maintenance of the central server? The main concern \nrelates to flow of trade-related data between exporting country and importing country \ntransmitted via a third country where the central server is installed. The legal questions \npertaining to such a model is connected with data retention, accessibility, archiving etc. \nThe other option is for the Member States\u2019 national single windows to be connected to \neach other through a common gateway application. \n                                                 \n19  The term \u201cinteroperability\u201d is defined as the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange \nand use information across borders without additional effort on the part of the trader.

World Customs Journal 5(2):3. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 744  Bal, Rajput, and Alizada \n \nOne crucial factor which is central to the concept of interoperability is that the national \nsingle windows which will ultimately participate to create the ISWE should actually be \nable to communicate or exchange the relevant information. Simply stated the single \nwindows must be interoperable. For this purpose, it is important that the relevant \ninternational standards be used as guidelines for the implementation of single windows \nacross jurisdictions. The TFA provides to this effect. Article 10.3 of the TFA provides \nthat Members are encouraged to use relevant international standards or parts thereof \nas a basis for their import, export, or transit formalities and procedures, except as \notherwise provided for in this Agreement. It is important to note that there are several \nimportant international instruments that have been developed by various international \ninstitutions with respect to developing or upgrading single windows. There are three \nimportant UN/CEFACT recommendations which is specific to single windows. They are \nas follows: \n\u2022  UN/CEFACT Recommendation 33 defines the concept of single windows and \nrecommends the government to establish single windows.23 \n\u2022  UN/CEFACT  Recommendation  34  focuses  on  the  issues  connected  to  the \nimplementation of single windows.  \n\u2022  UN/CEFACT Recommendation 35 focuses on legal aspects of single window \nfacilities.  \nSingle windows need to be supported by a legal framework to formalise and induce \ntrust  in  the  emanating  transactions  in  addition  to  technological  or  organizational \ninfrastructure.24 Many of the legal issues pertaining to the establishment and operation \nof  single  windows  can  be  addressed  through  contracts  and  memoranda  of \nunderstandings between relevant participants but others can be addressed through \nrecourse to international standards. There are several standards that are relevant in \ncontext of single windows which have been developed by intergovernmental agencies \nand international organizations such as UNCEFACT,25 UNNExT26 and WCO27.  \n                                                 \n23  UN/CEFACT. 2005.

Important legal issues considered by \nUNCITRAL related to electronic commerce such as authentication, and the legal status \nof electronic documents are hugely relevant in context of single window operation. It \nshould be noted that UNCITRAL basic e-commerce laws such as the UN Electronic \nCommunications  Convention;  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  on  Electronic  Commerce \n(MLEC);  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  on  Electronic  Signatures  (MLES)  provides  legal \nframework  for  the  operation  of  single  window  facilities.  The  new  Model  Law  on \nElectronic Transferable Records is also relevant because the processes connected \nwith single window transactions are electronic but still based on paper.28  \nFor ISWE to work, member countries that participate in creation of the environment \nmust agree on a common standard or mutually recognise the standards in the areas of \ninformation exchange, signatures, authentication, privacy, archiving etc. The question \nthat arises is - how can countries achieve this practically? Participating countries may \nseek  recourse  to  instruments  that  have  been  developed  by  various  international \ninstitutions  such  as  UNCITRAL,29 UNESCAP30 and  OECD31.  The  only  associated \ncomplication is when international standards, model laws and toolkits are implemented \nin different ways by countries. This in itself can pose a challenge for supporting cross-\nborder transactions. Consider the issue of e-signatures. Although, the importance of \nconcepts  of  \u201cfunctional  equivalence\u201d  and  \u201ctechnological  neutrality\u201d  has  been \nemphasised  in  the  UNCITRAL  Model  Law,32 but  countries  have  adopted  different \napproaches in implementing them in context of e-signatures. Some countries adopt a \nregulatory approach to e-signatures33 while the others take a more flexible view.34 \nIndividually these approaches are fine but in the ISWE context both approaches need \n                                                                                                                                            \nhttp://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trade/Publications/ece_372_ManualForDesignAlignedTradeForms.\npdf .

Implementing a common standard for identification, authentication and \nauthorization procedures for transactions seem to be most efficient. \nOnce the interoperable environment is set up it will allow for collaborative information \nsharing for both public and private sector stakeholders in global supply chains. More \nimportantly it has the potential to meet the requirements of entire international supply \nchain as opposed to the piecemeal benefit presented by single point data submission \nat  the  national  level.  This  will  also  reduce  the  volume  of  trade-related  paperwork \nrequired of traders by making them shared electronically. Sharing of trade related \ndocuments prior to arrival of goods through the ISWE environment would minimise time \nand costs associated with cargo clearance.  \nTo build the ISWE that complements the highly interconnected international trading \nscenario, the border agencies need to work together to encompass the entire supply \nchain where the goods can be assessed for admissibility and clearance prior to their \narrival at the physical border. Measures of co-ordination and co-operation range from \npolicy to documentary and physical control amongst domestic and international border \nagencies. However, the co-operation and co-ordination between international border \nagencies  is  based  on  a  political  mandate  and  can  manifest  through  international \nagreements and ratification of relevant conventions. In this context the proposed TFA\u2019s \nrole can be instrumental in achieving the desired result, as it will lead to political \ncommitment from WTO Members because of its multilateral nature. Article 12 of the \nTFA is a building block in that direction because it emphasises the importance of \ncustoms cooperation. It has to be recognized that the cooperation is not easy to \nachieve as each Member State may have its own requirements and set of rules that \nneed to be harmonized internally as the first step and then build a relationship based \non trust with other Member States. Article 12 of the TFA can be helpful from a futuristic \nperspective when considering the ISWE because it would establish the process and \nprocedures for the purposes of exchange and interaction between border agencies of \ndifferent jurisdictions.  \n4.  ASW \u2013 A CASE STUDY FOR INTEROPERABILITY \nASW creates an interoperable environment which connects and integrates National \nSingle Windows (NSW) of ASEAN Member countries at the regional level.35 The legal \nfoundation of the ASW can be found in the Agreement to Establish and Implement  \nthe  ASEAN  Single  Window, 36 Protocol  to  Establish  and  Implement  the  ASEAN  \nSingle Window37 (Implementation Protocol) and Protocol on the Legal Framework to \nImplement the ASEAN Single Window38 (Legal Framework Protocol). Currently the \nASW supports the exchange of intra-ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) \nand Certificate of Origin (ATIGA Form D) on a pilot basis among seven Member States \nand will be include exchange of other type of data in the future.39 Singapore, Malaysia, \n                                                 \n35  Several ASEAN countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam and Philippines \nhave already developed and implemented the NSW system.

Further, the purpose of the ASW \ncan be deciphered from Article 5 which defines the ASW. The Article provides that the \nASW is a regional facility to \u201cenable a seamless, standardized and harmonized routing \nand communication of trade and customs-related information and data for customs-\nclearance and release from and to NSW\u201d.41 It is estimated that the ASW will reduce the \ncost of trading by 8%.42 \nThe ASW architecture is based on the distributed gateway model where the NSW of \nthe ASEAN Member States are connected to the ASW Gateway Application through a \nsecure ASW network. This ASW Gateway Application is regionally developed and \ninstalled by each Member State. In addition, the centralized regional services support \nthe interaction of the MSWs. It is a facility which administrates and maintains standard \nformats, codes and other basic information of ASW.  \nThe ensuing empirical analysis is made to provide a methodology for assessing the \nbenefits of ASW at country-level. The analysis also allows to draw conclusions about \naggregate impact of ASW\u2019s early implementation on trade among Member States. \n4.1  Empirical Analysis \n4.1.1  Data Description \nThe data for empirical analysis have been collected from various sources. The export \ndata  have  been  obtained  from  UN  Commodity  Trade  database.  Since,  the  main \npurpose  of  empirical  analysis  is  to  examine  export  trends  around  ASEAN  SW \nimplementation phase; the data has been extracted for the period January 2012 to last \navailable country-month observation. Export data capture exports from Malaysia and \nSingapore to selected countries. Malaysian data expand from January 2012 to May \n2016 and Singaporean data expand from January 2012 to March 2016. The exports \ndata vary across month, partner country, and HS 2-digit commodity classes. \nASW  has  been  implemented  in  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Singapore,  Thailand  and  \nViet  Nam  since  30  December  2015.43 Moreover,  ASW  website  reports  that  the \nimplementation is in Phase 3 from that date and it covers live operations.44 For this \nstudy  it  is  important  to  obtain  trade  data  for  longer  period  as  possible  after  the \nimplementation of ASW has been in force. Only data for Malaysia and Singapore  \nare available on the UN Commodity Trade database for longer period. Therefore, the \nempirical analysis is carried out by exploiting monthly commodity export data of these \ntwo countries. \n \n                                                 \n40  ASEAN Website: http://asw.asean.org/about-asw (accessed 14 April 2017). \n41  Article 5, Protocol on the Legal Framework to Implement the ASEAN Single Window. \n42  It is indicated that a large portion of saving is attributed to the reduction in documentation dispatch. \nUNNExT, Towards an Enabling Environment for Paperless Trade-ASEAN Single Widow: A Regional \nSingle  Window  for  ASEAN  Connectivity,  Brief  No.  13,  May  2015.  http://www.unescap.org/ \nresources/unnext-brief-no-13-asean-single-window-regional-single-window-asean-connectivity \n(accessed 14 April 2017). \n43  See ASEAN Single Window Overview.

The  independent  variables  mainly  proxy  for  supply  side \neffects of exports. Producers Price Index (PPI) captures the impact of wholesale prices \non exports. Higher PPI means higher volumes of production and therefore higher \nprobability  for  exports.  However,  PPI  might  affect  exports  negatively  too  because \nhigher domestic prices would stimulate exporters to sell goods within a country rather \nthan  exporting  them.  Several  studies  have  shown  effect  of  external  borrowing \nconditions on firm outputs and exports.45 Average lending rate is assumed to capture \nthe effect of the price of bank lending. Ideally, Treasury-Bill rates or Interbank lending \nrates  will  be  better  proxies  for  credit  market  conditions.  However,  not  all  of  the \nexporting countries in the sample report these rates. Therefore, average lending rate, \nwhich is calculated as the average of retail and industry loans\u2019 rate, has been used to \napproximate credit market conditions. \nGDP growth is the measure of aggregate output of a country.

Consequently, in the long-run the impact \nof ASW on trade among participating countries is anticipated to be positive. At the \nmoment  ASW  allows  to  process  certificates  of  origin  and  customs  declaration \nelectronically.  As  mentioned  before,  the  processing  of  documents  through  ASW  \nhas started since 30 December 2015.47 Therefore, it is expected to have the effect of \nASW on exports of the participating countries from this date on. Since the data that  \nis exploited in this study is a monthly data,48 January 2016 is the \u201ccut-point\u201d for the \ndifference-in-difference analysis. Period after January 2016 is the treatment period and \nexports from Malaysia to Singapore and from Singapore to Malaysia are treatment \ngroup  in  the  sample.  Export  to  other  countries  is  the  control  group  for  baseline  \nmodel.  For  robustness  tests  the  following  treatment  and  control  groups  are  also \nanalyzed: All ASEAN countries vs. other countries and Malaysia and Singapore vs. \nother ASEAN countries.  \nIt  is  important  to  accurately  identify  what  events  have  happened  during  the \nimplementation of ASW and what is meant by \u201clive operations\u201d on ASW reports and \nwebpage. The information on these issues is limited; therefore assumptions made in \nthis paper regarding the implementation of ASW might be not very precise.

From Panel A it can be observed that exports to the \ntreatment group have been higher both before and after the implementation of ASW. \nHowever, the export gap between these groups has declined after the implementation \nof ASW; thus suggesting that exports have been diverted to control group countries \nafter  the  treatment  occurred.

Firstly, ASW might affect \nexports negatively because exporters might want to postpone their operations to make \nuse of ASW opportunities. Thus, in order take the advantage of trading through Single \nWindow exporters might delay sales in the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. This \nmight affect exports between Malaysia and Singapore in the short-run. Secondly, it is \npossible that the processing through SW is not as fast as it was expected. Moreover, \nnot all exporters might be able to fully utilize the SW application because they are not \nwell prepared (or trained). Finally, the uncertainty about how the SW application would \nwork  might  also  affect  the  negative  impact  of  its  implication.  Thus,  uninformed \nexporters might be willing to wait and observe how new application works. \nOne should notice that the negative impact of ASW is valid only for short period. \nTherefore, one should interpret these results as short-run effect of ASW. Moreover, \nthere might be another common economic factor driving the results, which might have \nhappened at the same time with ASW. Further improvement of this study should be \ndone through exploiting more data for longer time frame. Additionally, main identifying \nassumptions shall be improved as more information about the implementation of ASW \nis obtained.  \nThe analysis of control variables shows that, GDP growth, population, Distance to \nFrontier and oil prices are positively associated with exports. GDP growth proxies \naggregate output or exportable goods and population is a proxy for workforce. These \ntwo are important factors of production and therefore factors of exports. Distance to \nFrontier is a proxy for technology within a country. The better is the index, the more is \nthe probability that new businesses will emerge within a country. Moreover, new ideas \nand new technologies can be developed. WTI variable shows that the oil price has a \npositive effect on the exports of both countries. PPI index, which is the price of goods, \nis negatively associated with exports. The negative effect might be due to better prices \noffered  for  goods  in  the  domestic  markets.  Thus,  producers  might  abstain  from \nexporting and selling within a country when the prices for their goods increase in the \ncountry. Average lending rate is positively associated with exports. This implies that as \nborrowing from banks for consumers become expensive the demand for goods fall \nwithin a country. Therefore, producers seek for foreign buyers to sell their goods. All \nthese control variables proxy for demand effect of exports. \nExport trends around ASW. In order to further analyze the variation in exports across \ngroups before and after the treatment, the effect of time trends have been examined. \nFor this purpose, exports are estimated with time trend variable which is a continuous \nvariable taking values from 1 to n for the year-month periods from January 2012 until \nMay 2016. This is referred to as a general trend variable and is reported under the \ncolumns  2012M1\u20132016M5  in  Table  6.  The  second  trend  variable  (reported  under \n2016M1\u20132016M5 in Table 6) starts from the implementation of ASW and ends in May \n2016. The difference of the coefficients of the trend variables shows the impact of ASW \non exports. \nThe results from Table 6 confirm (statistically) the decrease of exports during the \nsample period; which can also be observed from Figures 1 and 2. General trend \nvariable is negatively correlated with exports and all of the coefficients are highly \nstatistically significant. In column 2 ASW trend variable is positively associated with \nexports suggesting a positive impact of ASW on the exports. However, when other \nfactors of exports are controlled, ASW trend variable becomes negative and highly \nstatistically significant in column 6. Difference of the coefficients from column 5 and 6 is \nstatistically significant suggesting ASW trend is different from general trend.

However, the expected benefits of the ASW will be \nfor both governments and business. For example, the pre-arrival information received \nwill enable expedited movement of goods that would benefit traders. It will also allow \nthe border authorities to apply risk management procedures more efficiently. Most \nimportantly, ASW has the potential to harmonise and streamline national procedures \nthat will be beneficial for businesses. \nCurrently, there are several challenges for a fuller implementation of ASW both from \nparticipation and functional perspectives. The first challenge is that ASEAN Member \nStates are at different levels of economic development. Some of the Member States do \nnot have a single window yet which can be integrated into the ASW environment. \nImplementing a single window at the national level is a matter of resources, expertise \nand national priority and political will.  \n \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 744  Bal, Rajput, and Alizada \n \nThe second challenge is that the ASEAN Member States have their own customs \nregimes and laws governing issues relevant for their respective NSW. This can pose a \nchallenge for interoperability and legal certainty. The notion of legal certainty has been \nin demand since centuries with respect to the commercial transactions. The quest for \ninduction  of  the  ubi  commercium,  ibi  ius  has  been  the  propelling  force  towards \nemergence of commercial customs and emergence of institutions for the settlement of \ncommercial disputes.53 In other words, the Latin adage reflects the insight that the \nefficiency of markets and trade depend on legal certainty. In the context of the ASW, \nthe notion of legal certainty is related to the ability of the businesses to predict and \nascertain the meaning and effect of the legal framework. The hope is that a predictable \nrule oriented framework of the ASW will reduce risk associated with cross-border trade \nprocesses for businesses. In the same context, the success of the ASW will depend on \nhow legal regimes of ASEAN Member States interoperate, especially to support cross-\nborder transactions. In addition, some other legal issues crucial for providing the legal \nframework such as functional equivalence of paper and electronic documents, mutual \nrecognition of digital signatures, etc. still need to be addressed.  \nFor the future of ASW some interesting suggestions have been put forward. The first \nand foremost concerns the enlargement of scope of regional transactions for cross-\nborder exchange of data within ASEAN and also between ASEAN and its dialogue \npartners. Other suggestions made in the same report are implementing the ASEAN \nCustoms  Transit  System  for  the  exchange  of  data  in  a  single  transit  declaration \ndirected to facilitate free movement of goods within the region; and launching a central \ntrade repository for trade related information that can be accessed by traders. 54  \nAn  important  aspect  that  merits  consideration  with  respect  to  the  ASW  is  the \nidentification of key stakeholders. The identification is important because it will help in \ndeveloping a business model for that can support the architecture\u2019s operation and \nmaintenance.  UN/CEFACT  Recommendation  and  Guidelines  on  Single  Window \nInteroperability No. 36 also highlights the importance of identification of stakeholders.55 \nThe draft Recommendation indicates that it is crucial to identify what stakeholders \nrequire  from  interoperability  for  the  assessment  of  feasibility.  In  such  a  case \nstakeholders\u2019 needs become the key drivers of the system. Identification of the role and \nbenefits of stakeholders of the ASW is crucial for its success.

INTEGRATION OF COMMERCIAL REQUIREMENTS \nIN ISWE \nThe discussion on stakeholders brings us to the consideration about the scope of \nISWE.  The  question  that  arises  is:  whether  the  ISWE  environment  should  focus \nprimarily on trade regulatory issues? This question is of tremendous important because \nthe arguable merit of implementing an ISWE is for creating an information channel \nwhich would address the entire supply chain. However, the ISWE which is primarily \ndriven by has trade regulatory processes and data would entail the flow of G2G, B2G \ndata which is not inclusive of the entire supply chain operations. It is submitted that the \nfull  potential  of  ISWE  can  be  realized  through  integration  of  G2G,  B2G  and  B2B \ninformation which is possible through the interoperability between single windows that \ninclude  transport  and  commercial  requirements.  It  is  further  submitted  that  the \ncommercial aspects of international trade when enmeshed with transport requirements \nin the single windows at the country level will form the building block for an ISWE which \nwill encompass G2G, B2G and B2B interactions. The single windows thus proposed \nshould function as an interface between trade, customs and transport stakeholders by \ndeveloping extensive inter-linkages to share information. Such integration will allow \nflow of real-time data that can offer numerous possibilities to enhance the visibility  \nof  international  supply  chains.  The  inclusion  of  the  commercial  and  transport \nrequirements in the ISWE will entail the participation of transport stakeholders such  \nas  carriers,  shippers,  ports,  transport  authorities,  insurance  providers,  etc.  The \nparticipation of such stakeholders is necessary to make the integration of G2G, B2G \nand B2B information possible.  \nRegulatory aspects of transport requirements have already been included in certain \nnational  single  window  systems  to  fulfil  reporting  and/or  customs  requirements.  \nFor  example,  the  EU  Maritime  Single  Window  initiative  simplifies  and  harmonizes  \nthe  administrative  procedures  applied  to  maritime  transport  by  making  electronic \ntransmission of information standard and also rationalizes ship-reporting formalities.57 It \nis noteworthy that the commercial and financial aspects of international trade which are \nenmeshed with transport are not captured through the existing transport oriented single \nwindow initiatives. The question arises how can commercial and financial aspects of \ninternational  trade  connected  with  transport  be  included  alongside  the  regulatory \ntransport requirements in the ISWE. In the above context it is submitted  that the \nemergence  of  federated  cloud  computing  and  distributed  ledger  technology  has \nopened  up  the  possibilities  for  creating  technical  solutions  for  the  complex \narrangements of stakeholders in the transport industry. However, the enabling legal \nframework that is required to implement such technologies for single windows still \nremains  fragmented  and  incomplete  across  jurisdictions.  For  this  purpose,  the \nremainder of the paper will focus on evaluating selected issues relevant to the issue of \nintegration of transport and commercial issue in the single window environment such \nas dematerialization of trade documents. It is one of the important elements connected \nto the implementation of ISWE.  \n   \n                                                 \n57  The Reporting Formalities Directive 2010/65/EU requires all EU Member States to establish National \nSingle Windows (NSW) to enable ships to report formalities when arriving in and/or departing from  \nEU ports. \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 744  Bal, Rajput, and Alizada \n \nThe  exclusion  of  the  commercial  aspects  in  existing  transport  single  windows  is \nunderstandable as addition of various transport stakeholders into the single window \nsystem would require complex coordination that can capture the prevalent relationships \nbetween  carrier  interests,  shipper  interests,  ports,  transport  authorities,  insurance \nproviders, etc., from legal and technical perspectives. Although emergence of new \ntechnology has opened up the possibilities for creating technical solutions for such \ncomplex  arrangements,  the  lack  of  enabling  national  laws  on  transport  and  e-\ncommerce in most jurisdictions pose a challenge. \n5.1  Electronic Bill of Lading \nTo illustrate the legal complexity from transport law and e-commerce law perspectives, \nthe situation to develop electronic bills of lading is briefly examined. A bill of lading \nperforms three functions, namely, it serves as evidence of the contract of carriage, acts \nas receipt for the goods, and is a document of title. The first two functions are easily \nreplicated  electronically  as  they  essentially  relate  to  transfer  of  information.  The \nchallenge lies in replicating the document of title function. Bills of lading embodied with \nthe title function have served various essential practical purposes in the commercial \nworld for several centuries. Traditionally, bills of lading acquired their powers to transfer \nrights represented in them through mercantile usage. This usage transcended national \nbarriers. The use of such documents achieved the same result in different jurisdictions \nacross the world, which was necessary if cross-border trade was to proceed smoothly. \nThe advent of a bill of lading responded precisely to the requirements of the business \ncommunity, and became a tool that the domestic laws of various countries eventually \ncame to recognise to achieve the effects that the lex mercatoria attributed to it.58 \n5.1.1  Title Function \nThe  title  function  denotes  three  uses  of  a  bill  of  lading.  First,  possession  of  the \ndocument constitutes constructive possession and control over the goods. Second, the \ndocument may be used to transfer title to the goods. Third, the document is used to \nprovide security in the goods to financial institutions involved in providing credit to \ninternational sale transactions.59 \nThe above discussion clarifies that the bill of lading, in addition to being the transport \ndocument issued by the carrier to the shipper, serves essential trade functions for the \nconsignor, consignee and banks. Therefore, the questions that arise are - How can the \nlegal  concept  of  a  bill  of  lading  be  dematerialised?  How  can  the  dematerialised \ninformation  be  channelized  to  fulfil  the  trade  functions  in  an  electronic  business \nenvironment?  \n5.1.2  BPO and SCF \nThe banking industry has made attempts to answer the above two questions for a while \nand developed contractual mechanisms to create electronic bill of lading platforms that \nalso offer trade finance services to international traders.60 One such service is called \n                                                 \n58  For a detailed discussion see Basu Bal, A. 2014.

However, BPO has mostly benefitted rated multinational corporations \nand not SMEs.63 It can be gleaned from the above illustration that a pure contractual \napproach  to  form  a  club  may  be  less  complicated  when  implementing  evolving \ntechnology but may result in a non-inclusive environment.64 Therefore, a governing \nlegal framework for electronic bill of lading is necessary and in its absence SMEs are \ndenied a level playing field in global supply chains.  \n5.1.3  Rotterdam Rules \nInternational institutions have made attempts to create a governing legal framework for \nuse of electronic bills of lading in international trade. In 2008, the United Nations \nGeneral  Assembly  adopted  the  \u201cUnited  Nations  Convention  on  Contracts  for  the \nInternational Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea,\u201d65 otherwise referred to as the \n\u201cRotterdam  Rules.\u201d  One  of  the  objectives  of  the  Rotterdam  Rules  is  to  facilitate  \ne-commerce  by  establishing  a  legal  framework  for  electronic  bills  of lading.66 The \nprovisions on electronic transport records in chapters 3 and 8 of the Rotterdam Rules \nare specifically designed to fill the gap in the area of carriage of goods in relation to  \ne-commerce.

Unlike a \nletter of credit, which requires that physical trade documents are manually examined, the BPO requires \naccess to electronic trade data. This data is controlled, verified and matched over time in a highly \nautomated process as new electronic trade data are submitted about progress of the underlying trade \ntransaction.

The creation of the Rotterdam Rules  \nwas initiated by the Comit\u00e9 Maritime International (CMI) and was subsequently passed on to the \nUNCITRAL Working Group III (Transport Law). The principal goal underlying the development of the \nRules is the creation of a modern and uniform law concerning the international carriage of goods by \nsea, in order to reduce transaction costs, increase predictability and stability, and engender greater \ncommercial  confidence  in  international  maritime  commerce.  The  Rotterdam  Rules  have  so  far  \nreceived 25 signatures and 3 ratifications, by a mix of developing and developed countries, including \nstrong  seafaring  and  trading  nations,  as  well  as  traditional  carrier  and  shipper  nations.  See  \n\u201cStatus  of  the  Rotterdam  Rules\u201d  http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/transport_goods/ \nrotterdam_status.html  (accessed  14  April  2017).  Pursuant  to  article  94,  the  Convention  requires \nratification or accession by at least 20 states to enter into force.  \n66  The Rotterdam Rules uses the term \u201cnegotiable transport documents\u201d to refer to bills of lading and the \nterm \u201cnon-negotiable transport documents\u201d to refer to sea waybills.

Article 10 of the Model Law provides a functional equivalence rule for \nthe possession of a transferable document or instrument. Functional equivalence of \npossession is achieved when a reliable method is employed to establish control of that \nrecord by a person and to identify the person in control. The notion of control when \nused  as  a  substitute  for  possession  requires  a  reliable  method  for  identifying  the \ncurrent  party  in  control  of  a  specific  electronic  record  as  the  said  notion  typically \nfocuses on the identity of the person entitled to enforce the rights embodied in the \nelectronic transferable record.71 The method of identification may be accomplished \nthrough a closed system72, or through an open system73. Under the draft model law, \nthe notion of original and uniqueness has been connected to control. Emphasis has \nbeen given to reliably ensure that the claim may be presented to the debtor only \nonce.74 \n5.2  SMEs Still Use Paper and are Excluded from SCF  \nThe Rotterdam Rules and the Model Law follows the principles of non-discrimination of \nelectronic  means,  functional  equivalence  and  technology  neutrality.  Both  the \ninstruments may be applied to electronic bills of lading once States implement them. \nSo far, leading maritime nations have not ratified the Rotterdam Rules. The Model Law \nwould be ready for use by States to draft their national legislation once the UNCITRAL \nCommission adopts it next year. It is submitted that certain maritime stakeholders have \nshown limited enthusiasm in accepting the Rotterdam Rules, which has attributed to \nlarge trading nations such as United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China not \n                                                 \n68  See van der Ziel, G.

Legal issues \nrelating to the use of electronic transferable records A/CN.9/WG.IV/WP.115. \n73  The open system is decentralised and uses block chain token which does not identify the holder in the \nrecord, i.e. in the token itself. A block chain ledger displays the addresses in which tokens are kept, the \naddresses  are  cryptographic  identities  (pseudonyms),  and  the  private  keys  corresponding  to  the \naddresses are secret.

At any rate, the answer to the first question of how can the \nlegal concept of a bill of lading be dematerialised can be found in the Rotterdam Rules \nand the Model Law.  \nThe  answer  to  the  second  question  -  how  can  the  dematerialised  information  be \nchannelized to fulfil the trade functions in an electronic business environment - still \nremains to be answered. Policymakers alone cannot answer this question. But, the \ncrucial question that policymakers should ask with respect to the Rotterdam Rules and \nthe Model Law is whether they can create the momentum for SMEs as the lack of a \ngoverning legal framework is affecting them the most.  \nLarge enterprises see value in using electronic data interchange (EDI) provide by large \nlogistics  service  providers,  such  as  DHL  or  UPS.  These  large  logistics  service \nproviders have their enterprise resource planning (ERP), transport management and \nlogistics systems that are connected to the ERP system of the large enterprise at  \none end and with customs and port authorities interface on the other end. Generally, \nSMEs do not have advanced internal ERP systems and do not use the services of such \nlarge logistics service providers. They continue to use a mix of electronic and paper \nbased  information  and  documentary  exchange,  which  puts  them  at  a  competitive \ndisadvantage  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  large  enterprises.  Moreover,  as  discussed  above  the \nbenefits of new financing techniques such as SCF are not efficiently extended to SMEs \nas they are outside the range of electronic visibility. BPO in its present form is suited for \nlarge  enterprises  that  have  a  high  volume  or  value  of  trade  with  established \ncounterparties. The small suppliers who feed into the supply chains of such large \nenterprises generally do not participate in SCF.77 \n5.3  ISWE May Help SMEs  \nThis paper has argued earlier that the merit of implementing ISWE is to create an \ninformation interaction infrastructure that would facilitate the entire supply chain. Also, it \nhas  been  pointed  out  that  the  regulatory  aspects  of  transport  requirements  have \nalready been included in certain national single window systems to fulfil reporting \n                                                 \n75  One of the authors of this paper attended the sessions of UNCITRAL Working Group III (Transport Law) \nthat deliberated on the Rotterdam Rules and UNCITRAL Working Group IV (Electronic Commerce) that \ndeliberated on the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records as an accredited observer.

He is also part of a research project on \nelectronic transport records at the School of Business, Economics and Law, University of Gothenburg, \nwhich is currently investigating the role of logistics service providers in enhancing supply chain finance. \nWhile conducting research for the project he has interviewed several members of the maritime industry \nin the United States.  \n76  UNCITRAL  Working  Groups  are  composed  of  delegates  from  States,  international  governmental \norganizations and invited international non-governmental organizations. Generally, industry participation \nis facilitated through observers from international non-governmental organizations who represent the \nviews of their organizations on matters where the organization concerned has expertise or international \nexperience so as to facilitate the deliberations. \n77  One empirical study in India has shown that small suppliers face several challenges which relate to \nhuman resource; technology and information technology; finance; inter and intra-firm coordination; \ncollaboration  and  alliance;  organizational  policy,  strategies  and  practices;  and  macro-institutional.  \nSee More, D. and Basu, P. 2013.

However,  the  commercial  and  financial  aspects  of \ninternational trade that are enmeshed with transport remain excluded in such transport \noriented single window initiatives. To include such aspects of international trade in \nISWE, it has to be ensured that there exists legally significant trusted transboundary \nelectronic interaction.78  \nTrusted transboundary electronic interaction is possible if interoperability is agreed at \npolitical, legal, organizational, semantic and technical levels. As explained above, large \nenterprises  have  already  achieved  trusted  transboundary  electronic  interaction \ncontractually. However, to be able to include SMEs in such interactions, the issue of \nlegal interoperability of trust has to be aligned through a legal framework so that \nexchanged data is accorded proper legal weight across jurisdictions. UNCITRAL may \nserve as a forum to create such legal framework for establishing necessary level of \ntrust  between  the  participants  of  the  trusted  infrastructure  that  will  ensure  legal \nsignificance  of  transboundary  electronic  exchange  of  data  issued  in  different \njurisdictions.  Also,  organizational  interoperability  and  semantic  interoperability  will \nrequire preparation of recommendations that can be agreed and understood by all \nparties. UN/CEFACT may take a leading role to prepare recommendations on how to \nbuild  and  manage  national  trust  infrastructures  in  a  best  way  so  they  would  be \ninteroperable with each other for trade facilitation.  \nIn  2015,  several  proposals  were  submitted  to  UNCITRAL  recommending  that  it \nundertake a project to develop a basic legal framework covering identity management \nand trust services as well as of cloud computing to facilitate international cross-border \ninteroperability.79 Working Group IV has now been tasked to move forward with such a \nproject.80  \nAnother  effort  worth  noting  is  the  Framework  Agreement  on  Facilitation  of  Cross-\nBorder Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific,81 which was adopted by UN/ESCAP \nand is open for signature from 1 October 2016. Article 1 of the Agreement states that \nthe objective is to facilitate cross-border paperless trade by enabling data exchange \nand mutual recognition of electronic trade data among willing ESCAP member States \nthrough  dedicated  intergovernmental  framework  to  develop  legal  and  technical \nsolutions. This Agreement provide ESCAP member States with a digital complement \nfor better implementation of the WTO TFA as well as on-going bilateral and sub-\nregional initiatives, such as the ASW.

CONCLUDING REMARKS \nThis paper considered only a sampling of the work currently being done on single \nwindows  and  associated  issues.  There  are  several  initiatives  focused  on  single \nwindow, paperless trade and e-commerce issues carried out in various parts of the \nworld. What may be found in all such initiatives are a number of interwoven commercial \nand trade law issues that may need to be addressed. The entry into force of the TFA \nmay  serve  as  impetus  to  engage  in  the  preparation  of  a  multilateral  Framework \nAgreement to provide the legal basis for ISWE. UNCITRAL has recently started work \non identity management and trust services as well as cloud computing to facilitate \ncross-border  interoperability.  In  the  coming  years  this  effort  may  ensure  legally \nsignificant trusted transboundary electronic interaction to include the commercial and \ntransport aspects in ISWE. \nInternational and regional institutions are increasingly cooperating to work for global \ntrade in the digital economy. In this context the interaction between law and institutions \nshould be explored in transformative contexts. The transformation may be the manner \nin which the functions of institutions may change over time; how institutions may act as \nagents  of  transformation;  and  how  institutions  themselves  can  be  subjected  to \ntransformation. If WTO decides to take up the work for creating ISWE, then it would be \ntransformation  of  an  institution  engaged  in  reducing  tariff  barriers  to  an  institution \ninvolved in reducing information barriers in international trade. If UNCITRAL has to \ntransform as an institution engaged in the modernization and harmonization of rules on \ninternational business, it has to lay emphasis on equality of opportunities for business \nactors participating in international trade. Working Group I of UNCITRAL, which is \ncurrently engaged in creating rules that would simplify incorporation and develop good \npractices  in  business  registration  of  micro,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(MSMEs) has stepped in that direction. It is hoped that in the future all other Working \nGroups  of  UNCITRAL,  in  addition  to  what  they  do,  will  also  explore  whether  the \nharmonized rules in their respective domain of work promote equality of opportunities \nfor businesses.  \n \n                                                 \n82  See note 80 in p. 49. \n28 \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Abhinayan Basu Bal, Trisha Rajput, and Parviz Alizada", "Company": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20170608154747+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 11 for Word", "Keywords": "single window, SME, ASEAN single window, transport single window, supply chain finance, electronic bill of lading, international single window environment", "ModDate": "D:20170608155115+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 11.0", "SourceModified": "D:20170608074735", "Subject": "Various international institutions have supported the implementation of national/regional single windows. The next logical step would be to internationalize and make them interoperable to allow for greater collaborative information sharing. We review the legal framework necessary for implementing an international single window environment (ISWE) and, in that context, examine particular economic and financial aspects of the current developments. We show that ISWE is desirable as it could contribute toward creating a level playing field for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in global supply chains. We discuss the ASEAN Single Window (ASW) to identify prospects and challenges, and highlight the legal and economic viability of interoperability. We examine ASW from the transaction cost and information asymmetry theory perspectives to provide a methodology for conducting empirical analysis at country level. Based on the findings, we argue that the full potential of ISWE can be realized through the integration of transport and commercial requirements, thereby improving government-to-government, business-to-government, and business-to-business information flows. Nevertheless, such integration would require the ability to capture the complex relationships between various transport actors from legal and technical standpoints. To illustrate this legal complexity from transport and e-commerce law angle, we examine the disadvantageous position of SMEs in relation to the use of electronic bills of lading and access to supply chain finance. A critical analysis of selected legal texts is made through the lens of recent developments such as distributed ledger and cloud technologies to suggest solutions for SMEs. The conclusion highlights that transport and commercial requirements in the ISWE have to be incorporated through laws made for e-commerce and not through a piecemeal approach that replicate the functions of paper documents in an electronic environment.", "Title": "International Single Window Environment: Prospects and Challenges"}}
