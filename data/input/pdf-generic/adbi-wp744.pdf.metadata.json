INTRODUCTION \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nThe various international and regional institutions that have been engaged in the work \non  issues  related  to  trade  in  digital  economy  has  to  a  certain  extent  directed  their \nefforts following the mantra of \u201ctrade facilitation\u201d. Some of those efforts have supported \nthe  implementation  of  national  and  regional  single  windows  across  jurisdictions  to  \nfulfil  import,  export,  and  transit-related  regulatory  requirements.  Interoperability  and \ninternationalization  of  national  single  windows  is  the  next  logical  step,  as  it  will  allow \ncollaborative  information  sharing  for  both  public  and  private  sector  stakeholders  in \nglobal  supply  chains. The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  review  the  legal  framework \nnecessary  for  implementing  an  international  single  window  environment  (ISWE)  and,  \nin  that  context,  examine  particular  economic  and  financial  aspects  of  the  current \ndevelopments.  The  past  and  on-going  efforts  of  some  of  the  relevant  international  \nand  regional  institutions 1 are  examined  in  contextual  detail  to  provide  a  legal  basis  \nfor  integration  of  national  single  windows  (NSW)  through  ISWE.  The  focus  of  the \ndiscussion is on the necessity for creating ISWE and how it may direct policymaking to \nrespond to global challenges such as participation and financing of small and medium \nenterprises (SMEs) in international supply chains. \nWith  the  progressive  ratification  of  the  WTO\u2019s  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  (TFA), 2 \nseveral  WTO  Member  States  are  likely  to  move  to  the  broader  use  of  electronic \ntransactions  through  use  of  information  and  communications  technologies  (ICT)  \nto  meet  their  multilateral  treaty  obligations.  For  example,  the  TFA  suggests  that \nmember-states  should  implement  NSW  and  recommend  the  use  of  ICT  methods  for \ntrade. The paper considers the contribution of the TFA and suggests that once majority \nof  the  WTO  Member  States  establish  single  windows,  most  of  the  necessary \ninfrastructure  for  creating  ISWE  would  be  present.  In  this  context  the  contribution  of \nother  international  institutions  such  as,  WCO,  UN/CEFACT,  UN/ESCAP,  UNCITRAL, \nUNNExT, etc., to develop the supplementary legal framework is discussed.  \n\nSince 2005, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been working to \ndevelop both the technical and legal frameworks for a regional Single Window referred \nto  as  the  ASEAN  Single  Window  (ASW).  This  paper  discusses  the  ASW  initiative  to \nidentify  prospects  and  challenges  that  may  be  relevant  for  creating  ISWE.  During  the \npast  several  months  ASW  has  supported  electronic  exchange  of  customs  declaration \nand  certificate  of  origin  between  five  Member  States  on  a  pilot  basis.  ASW  is  utilised  \nto  highlight  the  discussions  on  legal  and  economic  viability  of  interoperability.  The \ninitiative  is  examined  from  transaction  cost  and  information  asymmetry  theory \nperspectives  to  provide  a  methodology  for  conducting  empirical  analysis  at  country-\nlevel. The analysis allows to draw conclusions about aggregate impact of ASW\u2019s early \nimplementation on trade among ASEAN Member States.3 \n\n                                                 \n1   The  efforts  of  institutions  considered  are  the  United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe \n(UNECE),  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (UN/ESCAP), \nUnited  Nations  Centre  for  Trade  Facilitation  and  Electronic  Business  (UN/CEFACT),  United  Nations \nNetwork  of  Experts  for  Paperless  Trade  and  Transport  Facilitation  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (UNNExT), \nUnited  Nations  Commission  on  International  Trade  Law  (UNCITRAL),  World  Customs  Organization \n(WCO) and World Trade Organization (WTO).  \n\n2   WTO.  2013.  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  (WT/MIN(13)/36  or  WT/L/911)  https://www.wto.org/english/ \nthewto_e/minist_e/mc9_e/desci36_e.htm  (accessed  14  April  2017)  The  Agreement  entered  into  force \non 22 February 2017 after obtaining two-thirds acceptance from WTO\u2019s 164 members. \n\n3   It is to be noted that the ASW is conducting live operations on a pilot basis. Therefore, the interpretation \nof the empirical findings should not be related to the fully operating single window. The period analyzed \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nBuilding  upon  the  findings  from  the  ASW  experience  the  paper  emphasises  that  full \npotential  of  ISWE  can  be  realised  through  integration  of  Government-to-Government \n(G2G),  Business-to-Government  (B2G)  and  Business-to-Business  (B2B)  information. \nSuch integration of information into an interoperable environment will allow flow of real-\ntime data that can offer numerous possibilities to enhance the visibility of international \nsupply  chains.  It  is  argued  that  single  window  integration  at  international  level  should \ninclude transport and related commercial requirements in order to improve information \nflows among all supply chain actors. \n\nThe inclusion of the transport stakeholders into the single window system would require \ncomplex  coordination  that  can  capture  the  existing  relationships  between  carrier \ninterests, shipper interests, ports, transport authorities, insurance providers, etc., from \nlegal  and  technical  perspectives.  Emergence  of  new  technology  has  opened  up  \nthe  possibilities  for  creating  technical  solutions  for  such  complex  arrangements. \nNevertheless,  lack  of  enabling  national  laws  on  transport  and  e-commerce  in  most \njurisdictions may pose as a challenge. \n\nTo illustrate the legal complexity from transport law and e-commerce law perspectives \nthe existing situation with electronic bills of lading is briefly examined. The bill of lading, \nin addition to being the transport document issued by the carrier to the shipper, serves \nessential trade functions for the consignor, consignee and banks. The paper explores \nways through which the legal concept of a bill of lading can be dematerialised. In this \ncontext,  the  selected  provisions  of  the  Rotterdam  Rules  and  the  Model  Law  on \nElectronic Transferable Records is examined through the lens of recent developments \nbrought  through  automation  in  trade  and  evolving  technologies  such  as  distributed \nledger and cloud computing. \n\nThe  paper  discusses  the  necessity  for  ISWE  to  channelize  the  dematerialised \ninformation  of  a  bill  of  lading  to  fulfil  the  trade  functions  in  an  electronic  business \nenvironment. In this context the emergence of trade financing techniques such as bank \npayment  obligation  (BPO)  and  supply  chain  finance  (SCF)  are  discussed  to  highlight \nthat  an  ISWE  is  desirable  for  creating  a  level  playing  field  for  SMEs  participating  in \nglobal supply chains.  \n\n2.  TRADE FACILITATION \n\nOver the last several years, numerous multilateral and regional institutions have been \nengaged  in  law-making  initiatives  related  to  e-commerce,  paperless  trade,  electronic \nsingle  window,  and  cross-border  e-transaction  and  commercial  law  matters.  Most  of \nthese initiatives feature under the broad heading of trade facilitation.  \n\nTrade  facilitation  initiatives  are  commonly  considered  to  create  standards  and \nguidelines  for  the  exchange  of  goods  and  services  across  borders. 4  Commercial \naspects  of  trade  have  also  been  considered  within  the  ambit  of  trade  facilitation  by \ncertain institutions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                            \nin this study is significantly short. Therefore, this effect should be interpreted as short-run effect of ASW \non exports. \n\n4   See the definitions of trade facilitation as used by institutions such as WTO, UN/CEFACT and WCO. \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nWTO defines trade facilitation as: \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nthe  simplification  and  harmonization  of  international  trade  procedures, \nwhere  trade  procedures  are  the  activities,  practices  and  formalities \ninvolved  in  collecting,  presenting,  communicating  and  processing  data \nand other information required for the movement of goods in international \ntrade.5 \n\nUN/CEFACT defines trade facilitation as: \n\nthe  simplification,  standardization,  and  harmonization  of  procedures  and \nassociated information flows required to move goods from seller to buyer \nand to make payments.6 \n\nOECD defines trade facilitation as:  \n\nthe  simplification  and  standardization  of  procedures  and  associated \ninformation  flows  required  to  move  goods  internationally  from  seller  to \nbuyer and to pass payments in the other direction.7 \n\nThe  above-mentioned  definitions  are  particularly  interesting  because  they  emphasise \non the flow of information connected with the physical movement of goods.8 This flow \nof  information,  which  can  be  enhanced  through  digitalization  of  trade  processes, help \nbusinesses and governmental agencies to manage risks and reduce transaction costs. \nThere  exist  a  positive  correlation  between  digitalization  and  economic  growth. 9 An \nimportant practical tool for coordinating trade processes10 and procedures at the border \nto ensure smooth flow of information is an electronic single window facility. \n\nSingle window is defined by the WCO as: \n\nAn intelligent facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to \nlodge standardized information and documents with a single entry point to \nfulfil all import, export and transit related regulatory requirements.11  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5   WTO, A Training Package: What is Trade Facilitation? www.gfptt.org/sites/default/files/refread/Training-\n\nguide-final.pdf (accessed 14 April 2017). \n\n6   UNECE,  Trade  Facilitation \n\nImplementation  Guide.  http://tfig.unece.org/details.html \n\n(accessed  \n\n14 April 2017). \n\n7   OECD.  2005.The  Costs  and  benefits  of  Trade  Facilitation.  http://www.oecd.org/trade/facilitation/ \n\n35459690.pdf (accessed 14 April 2017). \n\n8   A  typical  international  supply  chain  features  the  physical  movement  of  goods,  the  financial  aspects  of \nthe  transaction,  and  the  flow  of  information  within  the  various  actors  in  the  supply  chain.  The  three \nlayers exist as parallel processes with limited interaction between them. However, the use of ICT may \nenhance  interaction  between  the  three  layers.

Some  examples  of \nnational single window systems are International Trade Data System (ITDS) of the US, \nUNI-PASS Customs system and KTNET national trade single window of the Republic \nof Korea, TradeXchange of Singapore and PortNet of Finland.  \n\n3.  TFA CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS CREATING ISWE  \n\nOne interesting aspect that emerges from evaluating the single window reform across \ncountries  is  that  implementation  is  fragmented  than  desired. 15  Such  fragmentation \ncreated the need for a comprehensive trade facilitation reform which would consolidate \nand multilateralize the commitments of States to create efficient trading processes and \nprocedures  at  the  borders.16 The  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  (TFA), 17 which  is  the \nresult of the Bali Ministerial Conference in December 2013,18 is a step in that direction. \nOnce the TFA is fully implemented, it will result in an environment where WTO Member \n\n                                                 \n12  UN/CEFACT.  2005.

Article 10 of the TFA mandates that \nall  Members  of  the  WTO  shall  endeavour  to  establish  and  maintain  a  single  window \nenabling  traders  to  submit  documentation  for  export,  import  and  transit  of  goods \nthrough  a  single  entry  point.  It  is  important  to  mention  that  the  implementation  of  a \nsingle  window  system  develops  on  the  GATT  1994  Article  VIII  concerning  Fees  and \nFormalities  connected  with  the  importation  and  exportation,  where  paragraph  1(c) \nrecognizes \u201cthe need for minimizing the incidence and complexity of import and export \nformalities  and  for  decreasing  and  simplifying  import  and  export  documentation \nrequirement\u201d. The single window system under the TFA has to be implemented by the \nMembers of the WTO thereby allowing traders to lodge information with a single body \nfor  the  purposes  of  all  import  or  export  related  regulatory  requirements.  This  system \nseeks  to  ensure  that  all  procedures,  data  and  requirements  related  to  the  trade \ntransaction  is  handled  and  overseen  by  one  agency  which  takes  the  responsibility  of \ncombined  controls.  In  addition  to  making  the  procedural  requirements  for  the  traders \nsimple and standardized, this system facilitates information flows enhancing efficiency.  \n\nis \n\nto \n\nan \n\nrefers \n\nstated \n\ncharacterized \n\nenvironment  which \n\nIt  is  submitted  that  the  implementation  of  TFA  by  164  Members  will  establish  single \nwindows  (to  facilitate  import,  export  and  transit-related  regulatory  functions)  across \njurisdictions that will establish the infrastructure for the ISWE. The concept of the ISWE \nby \nsimply \ninteroperability 19 between  various  national  single  windows.  The \ninteroperable \nenvironment  reflects  the  position  where  national  single  windows  communicate  with \neach other to exchange relevant information. In practice the discussion on ISWE must \nbegin  with  the  deliberation  on  different  technological  and  organizational  models  for \nmaking  interoperability  possible.  After  surveying  existing  literature  it  is  revealed  that \ntwo  models  are  proposed  for  the  design  of  interoperability,  namely  centralised  server \nmodel 20  and  gateway  model. 21  More  recently,  cloud  computing  has  also  been \nsuggested  as  a  way  forward  to  build  a  supranational  single  window. 22  The \ntechnological  framework  that  is  selected  for  the  creation  of  the  ISWE  framework  may \nentail distinct legal and political deliberations. If a centralised server model is adopted \nfor ISWE then a central server may be used to host a gateway which will facilitate the \ntrade  data  exchange.  This  model  seems  simple  from  a  practical  perspective  but  it \nposes  problematic  political  questions.  One  such  question  is  which  Member  State  will \nhost and be responsible for the maintenance of the central server? The main concern \nrelates  to  flow  of  trade-related  data  between  exporting  country  and  importing  country \ntransmitted via a third country where the central server is installed. The legal questions \npertaining to such a model is connected with data retention, accessibility, archiving etc. \nThe other option is for the Member States\u2019 national single windows to be connected to \neach other through a common gateway application. \n\n                                                 \n19  The term \u201cinteroperability\u201d is defined as the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange \nand  use  information  across  borders  without  additional  effort  on  the  part  of  the  trader.

World Customs Journal 5(2):3. \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nOne crucial factor which is central to the concept of interoperability is that the national \nsingle windows which will ultimately participate to create the ISWE should actually be \nable  to  communicate  or  exchange  the  relevant  information.  Simply  stated  the  single \nwindows  must  be  interoperable.  For  this  purpose,  it  is  important  that  the  relevant \ninternational standards be used as guidelines for the implementation of single windows \nacross  jurisdictions.  The  TFA  provides  to  this  effect.  Article  10.3  of  the  TFA  provides \nthat Members are encouraged to use relevant international standards or parts thereof \nas  a  basis  for  their  import,  export,  or  transit  formalities  and  procedures,  except  as \notherwise provided for in this Agreement. It is important to note that there are several \nimportant  international  instruments  that  have  been  developed  by  various  international \ninstitutions  with  respect  to  developing  or  upgrading  single  windows.  There  are  three \nimportant UN/CEFACT recommendations which is specific to single windows. They are \nas follows: \n\n\u2022  UN/CEFACT  Recommendation  33  defines  the  concept  of  single  windows  and \n\nrecommends the government to establish single windows.23 \n\n\u2022  UN/CEFACT  Recommendation  34  focuses  on  the  issues  connected  to  the \n\nimplementation of single windows.  \n\n\u2022  UN/CEFACT  Recommendation  35  focuses  on  legal  aspects  of  single  window \n\nfacilities.  \n\nSingle  windows  need  to  be  supported  by  a  legal  framework  to  formalise  and  induce \ntrust  in  the  emanating  transactions  in  addition  to  technological  or  organizational \ninfrastructure.24 Many of the legal issues pertaining to the establishment and operation \nof  single  windows  can  be  addressed \nthrough  contracts  and  memoranda  of \nunderstandings  between  relevant  participants  but  others  can  be  addressed  through \nrecourse  to  international  standards.  There  are  several  standards  that  are  relevant  in \ncontext of single windows which have been developed by intergovernmental agencies \nand international organizations such as UNCEFACT,25 UNNExT26 and WCO27.  \n\n                                                 \n23  UN/CEFACT.  2005.

Important  legal  issues  considered  by \nUNCITRAL related to electronic commerce such as authentication, and the legal status \nof  electronic  documents  are  hugely  relevant  in  context  of  single  window  operation.  It \nshould  be  noted  that  UNCITRAL  basic  e-commerce  laws  such  as  the  UN  Electronic \nCommunications  Convention;  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  on  Electronic  Commerce \n(MLEC);  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  on  Electronic  Signatures  (MLES)  provides  legal \nframework  for  the  operation  of  single  window  facilities.  The  new  Model  Law  on \nElectronic  Transferable  Records  is  also  relevant  because  the  processes  connected \nwith single window transactions are electronic but still based on paper.28  \n\nFor  ISWE  to  work,  member  countries  that  participate  in  creation  of  the  environment \nmust agree on a common standard or mutually recognise the standards in the areas of \ninformation  exchange,  signatures,  authentication,  privacy,  archiving  etc.  The  question \nthat arises is - how can countries achieve this practically? Participating countries may \nseek  recourse  to  instruments  that  have  been  developed  by  various  international \ninstitutions  such  as  UNCITRAL, 29  UNESCAP 30  and  OECD 31 .  The  only  associated \ncomplication is when international standards, model laws and toolkits are implemented \nin different ways by countries. This in itself can pose a challenge for supporting cross-\nborder  transactions.  Consider  the  issue  of  e-signatures.  Although,  the  importance  of \nconcepts  of  \u201cfunctional  equivalence\u201d  and  \u201ctechnological  neutrality\u201d  has  been \nemphasised  in  the  UNCITRAL  Model  Law, 32  but  countries  have  adopted  different \napproaches in implementing  them in context of e-signatures. Some countries adopt a \nregulatory  approach  to  e-signatures 33 while  the  others  take  a  more  flexible  view. 34 \nIndividually these approaches are fine but in the ISWE context both approaches need \n\n                                                                                                                                            \nhttp://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trade/Publications/ece_372_ManualForDesignAlignedTradeForms.\npdf .

Implementing a common standard for identification, authentication and \nauthorization procedures for transactions seem to be most efficient. \n\nOnce the interoperable environment is set up it will allow for collaborative information \nsharing  for  both  public  and  private  sector  stakeholders  in  global  supply  chains.  More \nimportantly it has the potential to meet the requirements of entire international supply \nchain as opposed to the piecemeal benefit presented by single point data submission \nat  the  national  level.  This  will  also  reduce  the  volume  of  trade-related  paperwork \nrequired  of  traders  by  making  them  shared  electronically.  Sharing  of  trade  related \ndocuments prior to arrival of goods through the ISWE environment would minimise time \nand costs associated with cargo clearance.  \n\nTo  build  the  ISWE  that  complements  the  highly  interconnected  international  trading \nscenario,  the  border  agencies  need  to  work  together  to  encompass  the  entire  supply \nchain  where  the  goods  can  be  assessed  for  admissibility  and  clearance  prior  to  their \narrival at the physical border. Measures of co-ordination and co-operation range from \npolicy to documentary and physical control amongst domestic and international border \nagencies.  However,  the  co-operation  and  co-ordination  between  international  border \nagencies  is  based  on  a  political  mandate  and  can  manifest  through  international \nagreements and ratification of relevant conventions. In this context the proposed TFA\u2019s \nrole  can  be  instrumental  in  achieving  the  desired  result,  as  it  will  lead  to  political \ncommitment  from  WTO  Members  because  of  its  multilateral  nature.  Article  12  of  the \nTFA  is  a  building  block  in  that  direction  because  it  emphasises  the  importance  of \ncustoms  cooperation.  It  has  to  be  recognized  that  the  cooperation  is  not  easy  to \nachieve  as  each  Member  State  may  have  its  own  requirements  and  set  of  rules  that \nneed to be harmonized internally as the first step and then build a relationship based \non trust with other Member States. Article 12 of the TFA can be helpful from a futuristic \nperspective  when  considering  the  ISWE  because  it  would  establish  the  process  and \nprocedures for the purposes of exchange and interaction between border agencies of \ndifferent jurisdictions.  \n\n4.  ASW \u2013 A CASE STUDY FOR INTEROPERABILITY \n\nASW  creates  an  interoperable  environment  which  connects  and  integrates  National \nSingle Windows (NSW) of ASEAN Member countries at the regional level.35 The legal \nfoundation  of  the  ASW  can  be  found  in  the  Agreement  to  Establish  and  Implement  \nthe  ASEAN  Single  Window, 36  Protocol  to  Establish  and  Implement  the  ASEAN  \nSingle  Window37 (Implementation  Protocol)  and  Protocol  on  the  Legal  Framework  to \nImplement  the  ASEAN  Single  Window 38 (Legal  Framework  Protocol).  Currently  the \nASW supports the exchange of intra-ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) \nand Certificate of Origin (ATIGA Form D) on a pilot basis among seven Member States \nand will be include exchange of other type of data in the future.39 Singapore, Malaysia, \n\n                                                 \n35  Several ASEAN countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam and Philippines \nhave already developed and implemented the NSW system. Brunei, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nCambodia and Myanmar have not implemented Single Windows.  \n\n36  Signed on 9 December 2005. http://asean.org/?static_post=agreement-to-establish-and-implement-the-\n\nasean-single-window-kuala-lumpur-9-december-2005-2 (accessed 14 April 2017). \n\n37  Signed  on  20  December  2006.  http://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/images/archive/23084.pdf \n\n38  Signed  on  9  September  2015.  http://agreement.asean.org/media/download/20150915020056.pdf \n\n(accessed 14 April 2017). \n\n(accessed 14 April 2017). \n\n39  ASEAN Website: http://asw.asean.org/ (accessed 14 April 2017). \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nIndonesia,  Thailand,  Viet  Nam  have  already  tested  ATIGA  Form  D  using  the  \nASW architecture.40 \n\nArticle  1  of  the  Implementation  Protocol  defines  the  ASW  as  an  environment  where \nNSW  of  the  Member  States  operate  and  integrate.  Further,  the  purpose  of  the  ASW \ncan be deciphered from Article 5 which defines the ASW. The Article provides that the \nASW is a regional facility to \u201cenable a seamless, standardized and harmonized routing \nand  communication  of  trade  and  customs-related  information  and  data  for  customs-\nclearance and release from and to NSW\u201d.41 It is estimated that the ASW will reduce the \ncost of trading by 8%.42 \n\nThe  ASW  architecture  is  based  on  the  distributed  gateway  model  where  the  NSW  of \nthe ASEAN Member States are connected to the ASW Gateway Application through a \nsecure  ASW  network.  This  ASW  Gateway  Application  is  regionally  developed  and \ninstalled by each Member State. In addition, the centralized regional services support \nthe interaction of the MSWs. It is a facility which administrates and maintains standard \nformats, codes and other basic information of ASW.  \n\nThe  ensuing  empirical  analysis  is  made  to  provide  a  methodology  for  assessing  the \nbenefits  of ASW  at  country-level.  The  analysis  also  allows to  draw  conclusions  about \naggregate impact of ASW\u2019s early implementation on trade among Member States. \n\n4.1  Empirical Analysis \n\n4.1.1  Data Description \n\nThe data for empirical analysis have been collected from various sources. The export \ndata  have  been  obtained  from  UN  Commodity  Trade  database.  Since,  the  main \npurpose  of  empirical  analysis  is  to  examine  export  trends  around  ASEAN  SW \nimplementation phase; the data has been extracted for the period January 2012 to last \navailable  country-month  observation.  Export  data  capture  exports  from  Malaysia  and \nSingapore  to  selected  countries.  Malaysian  data  expand  from  January  2012  to  May \n2016  and  Singaporean  data  expand  from  January  2012  to  March  2016.  The  exports \ndata vary across month, partner country, and HS 2-digit commodity classes. \n\nASW  has  been  implemented  in  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Singapore,  Thailand  and  \nViet  Nam  since  30  December  2015. 43  Moreover,  ASW  website  reports  that  the \nimplementation  is  in  Phase  3  from  that  date  and  it  covers  live  operations.44 For  this \nstudy  it  is  important  to  obtain  trade  data  for  longer  period  as  possible  after  the \nimplementation  of  ASW  has  been  in  force.  Only  data  for  Malaysia  and  Singapore  \nare available on the UN Commodity Trade database for longer period. Therefore, the \nempirical analysis is carried out by exploiting monthly commodity export data of these \ntwo countries. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n40  ASEAN Website: http://asw.asean.org/about-asw (accessed 14 April 2017). \n41  Article 5, Protocol on the Legal Framework to Implement the ASEAN Single Window. \n42  It  is  indicated  that  a  large  portion  of  saving  is  attributed  to  the  reduction  in  documentation  dispatch. \nUNNExT,  Towards  an  Enabling  Environment  for  Paperless  Trade-ASEAN  Single  Widow:  A  Regional \nSingle  Window \nfor  ASEAN  Connectivity,  Brief  No.  13,  May  2015.  http://www.unescap.org/ \nresources/unnext-brief-no-13-asean-single-window-regional-single-window-asean-connectivity \n(accessed 14 April 2017). \n\n43  See ASEAN Single Window Overview.

Table  1  reports  the  summary \nstatistics of the dependent variable and independent variables. As it can be observed \nfrom  the  table,  there  are  422853  exporter-month-destination-commodity  observations. \nThe  observations  are  approximately  evenly  distributed  among  reporting  countries,  i.e. \nMalaysia  and  Singapore.  The  independent  variables  mainly  proxy  for  supply  side \neffects of exports. Producers Price Index (PPI) captures the impact of wholesale prices \non  exports.  Higher  PPI  means  higher  volumes  of  production  and  therefore  higher \nprobability  for  exports.  However,  PPI  might  affect  exports  negatively  too  because \nhigher domestic prices would stimulate exporters to sell goods within a country rather \nthan  exporting  them.  Several  studies  have  shown  effect  of  external  borrowing \nconditions  on  firm  outputs  and  exports.45 Average  lending  rate  is  assumed  to  capture \nthe effect of the price of bank lending. Ideally, Treasury-Bill rates or Interbank lending \nrates  will  be  better  proxies  for  credit  market  conditions.  However,  not  all  of  the \nexporting countries in the sample report these rates. Therefore, average lending rate, \nwhich is calculated as the average of retail and industry loans\u2019 rate, has been used to \napproximate credit market conditions. \n\nGDP growth is the measure of aggregate output of a country. The higher the output the \nhigher  is  the  probability  of  goods  to  be  exported.  Population  variable  is  the  proxy  for \nemployed  people.  WTI  and  Brent  are  both  oil  prices  and  capture  the  price  effect  on \nexports. Distance to frontier is a comparable measure of Doing Business index. Higher \nvalue of Distance to frontier means improved Doing Business opportunities. This data \nis  obtained from  the  World  Bank  Doing  Business  reports. This  variable  does not vary \nacross  months  but  only  across  years.  Exchange  rate  and  inflation  are  different \nmeasures of macroeconomic factors. \n\nTable 2: Correlation Matrix \n\nExports \n(US$) \n1 \n0.2610 \n0.0035 \n\u20130.0134 \n0.0007 \n\u20130.0134 \n\u20130.0133 \n0.0159 \n0.0144 \n0.0133 \n\u20130.0147 \n0.0065 \n\nln(Exports)  PPI_exporter \n \n \n\n1 \n0.0246 \n0.1652 \n0.0162 \n0.1671 \n0.1674 \n\u20130.1475 \n0.0209 \n0.0187 \n0.1563 \n0.0302 \n\n \n1 \n0.1071 \n\u20130.0710 \n0.1155 \n0.1155 \n\u20130.1008 \n0.2323 \n0.2321 \n0.1061 \n0.2767 \n\nAverage \nLending \nRate \n \n \n \n1 \n0.072 \n0.9948 \n0.9929 \n\u20130.9162 \n\u20130.1074 \n\u20130.1061 \n0.9815 \n0.1112 \n\n \n\nExports (US$) \nln(Exports) \nPPI_exporter \nAverage lending rate \nGDP Growth \nPopulation estimate \nln(Population) \nDistance to Frontier \nBrent \nWTI \nExchange rate \nInflation reporter \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP \nGrowth \n\n \n \n \n \n1 \n0.0766 \n0.0773 \n\u20130.0165 \n0.1822 \n0.2033 \n0.0391 \n0.2023 \n\nPopulation \nEstimate \n\n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n0.9998 \n\u20130.9223 \n\u20130.0558 \n\u20130.0545 \n0.9708 \n0.1096 \n\ncontinued on next page \n\n                                                 \n45  See  for  example,  Chor,  D.  and  Kalina,  M.  2012.

As  it  can  be  observed,  average \nlending  rate  variable  is  highly  correlated  with  many  of  independent  variables.  This \nmight cause a multicollinearity problem; therefore average lending rate is not included \nin  the  models  with  other  highly  correlating  variables.  Exchange  rate  variable  also \nshows  similar  pattern  and  is  not  included  in  empirical  analyses.  Correlations  among \nother variables are significantly low. \n\n4.1.2  Identification Strategy and Empirical Method \n\nAccording  to  the  ASW  website  the  main  objectives  of  the  ASW  is  to  provide  fast  \nand  transparent  business  opportunities  among  participating  countries.  46  Moreover,  \nby  allowing  to  process  information  electronically,  ASW  is  expected  to  reduce \nadministrative costs related to documentation. Consequently, in the long-run the impact \nof  ASW  on  trade  among  participating  countries  is  anticipated  to  be  positive.  At  the \nmoment  ASW  allows  to  process  certificates  of  origin  and  customs  declaration \nelectronically.  As  mentioned  before,  the  processing  of  documents  through  ASW  \nhas started since 30 December 2015.47 Therefore, it is expected to have the effect of \nASW  on  exports  of  the  participating  countries  from  this  date  on.  Since  the  data  that  \nis  exploited  in  this  study  is  a  monthly  data,48 January  2016  is  the  \u201ccut-point\u201d  for  the \ndifference-in-difference analysis. Period after January 2016 is the treatment period and \nexports  from  Malaysia  to  Singapore  and  from  Singapore  to  Malaysia  are  treatment \ngroup  in  the  sample.  Export  to  other  countries  is  the  control  group  for  baseline  \nmodel.  For  robustness  tests  the  following  treatment  and  control  groups  are  also \nanalyzed:  All  ASEAN  countries  vs.  other  countries  and  Malaysia  and  Singapore  vs. \nother ASEAN countries.  \n\nIt  is  important  to  accurately  identify  what  events  have  happened  during  the \nimplementation  of  ASW  and  what  is  meant  by  \u201clive  operations\u201d  on  ASW  reports  and \nwebpage.  The  information  on  these  issues  is  limited;  therefore  assumptions  made  in \nthis paper regarding the implementation of ASW might be not very precise. This paper \noffers  pilot  analysis  of  export  trends  in  ASEAN.

The  observations  after  the  treatment  (ASW)  constitute \napproximately  8%  of  the  sample.  Only  2%  of  all  observations  are  in  treatment  group. \nThe magnitudes of the variables do not vary substantially for before and after treatment \nperiods. Table 4 reports statistical tests of the differences of ln(Exports) before ASW in \ntreatment  and  control  groups.  From  Panel  A  it  can  be  observed  that  exports  to  the \ntreatment  group  have  been  higher  both  before  and  after  the  implementation  of  ASW. \nHowever, the export gap between these groups has declined after the implementation \nof  ASW;  thus  suggesting  that  exports  have  been  diverted  to  control  group  countries \nafter  the  treatment  occurred.  The  difference  between  these  groups  should  not  be \nunderstood  in  absolute  terms,  rather  higher  exports  to  the  treatment  group  means \nqualitative  difference  between  treatment  and  control  groups.  Both,  Malaysia  and \nSingapore, are major trading partners for each other. Therefore, qualitatively, these two \ncountries  trade  with  each  other  more  than  compared  to  other  countries.  Additionally, \nPanel  B  suggests  that  both,  exports  to  treatment  and  exports  to  control  groups  of \ncountries  have  declined  after  the  treatment.  However,  the  decline  is  not  statistically \nsignificant for the treatment group. \n\nTable 4: Comparative Statistics of ln(Exports)  \n\nBefore \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nAfter \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTreatment \n\nControl \n\nDifference \n\nTreatment \n\nControl \n\nDifference \n\nMean \n\nSt.Dev \n\n14.5488 \n\n2.5637 \n\n11.3445 \n\n2.9255 \n\n\u20133.2043 \n\n14.4350 \n\n0.0967 \n\n11.3445 \n\n0.01476 \n\n\u20133.1239 \n\nBefore \n\nAfter \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nBefore \n\nAfter \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTreatment \n\nTreatment \n\nDifference \n\nMean \n\nSt.Dev \n\n14.5488 \n\n2.5637 \n\n14.4350 \n\n2.6408 \n\n0.1138 \n\nControl \n\n11.3445 \n\n2.9255 \n\nControl \n\nDifference \n\n11.3111 \n\n2.8459 \n\n0.0334 \n\nt-stat \n(p-value) \n\n\u201329.7246 \n\n(0.0000) \n\nt-statistic \n(p-value) \n\n2.1018 \n\n(0.0356) \n\n \n\n \n\nPanel A \n\n(ii) \n\nt-stat \n(p-value) \n\n\u201397.6456 \n\n(0.0000) \n\nPanel B \n\nt-statistic \n(p-value) \n\n1.1571 \n\n(0.2473) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1.3  Exports During Sample Period \n\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate export trends from Malaysia and Singapore during the \nsample period. As it can be observed from Figure 1 exports have been falling between \nJanuary  2012  and  mid-2016  in  both  countries.  Singapore  exports  show  significantly \nhigher  fall  from  US$40  billion  in  2012  to  US$  27  billion  in  2016.  Moreover,  there  is  a \nsevere fall in Singaporean exports between October 2012 and April 2013. Exports from \nMalaysia have been steady through the sample period and show moderate fall. There \nhas  been  16%  decrease  in  Malaysian  exports  compared  to  the  January  2012  figures \n(fall from US$ 17.5 billion to US$ 15 billion).  \n\nFigure  2  illustrates  both  countries\u2019  exports  to  each  other  and  to  the  rest  of  the  world. \nMalaysian exports to Singapore have been stable over the observed period. However, \nSingaporean exports show significant fall, both to Malaysia and to the rest of the world. \nDashed  line  shows  the  time  when  ASW  implementation  has  started.  Trends  of  the \nexports  of  Malaysia  and  Singapore  after  this  period  do  not  show  obvious  patterns  of \nimprovement, neither to each other nor to the rest of the world. \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nFigure 1: Aggregate Exports from Malaysia and Singapore \n\nFigure 2: Comparative Graph of Exports to the Treatment and Control Groups \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1.4  Results \n\n4.1.4.1 Main Findings \n\nTable 5 reports the results of baseline model.

The coefficients of Treat suggest that \non  average  exports  to  restricted  ASEAN  countries52 are  2.6-3%  higher  compared  to \nother  countries.  Jan2016  variable  captures  the  ceteris-paribus  effect  of  ASW  on \nexports generally. The coefficients suggest that the implication of ASW did not affect all \nexports  in  our  restricted  ASEAN  sample,  i.e.  it  is  statistically  equal  to  zero.  The  third \nvariable,  Treat*Period,  captures  the  effect  of  ASW  on  the  trade  between  participating \ncountries (this is the main variable of interest). In contrast to what was anticipated from \nthe  implication  of  ASW,  the  results  suggest  that  exports  between  Malaysia  and \nSingapore have fallen after the ASW has been in force. However, one should take into \naccount  that  the  period  analyzed  in  this  study  is  significantly  short.  Therefore,  this \neffect should be interpreted as a short-run effect of ASW on exports. As it was argued \nin  the  previous  section,  the  negative  effect  should  not  be  interpreted  as  ASW  direct \neffect on exports. Since it is not clear what operations have been carried out during the \nimplementation  of  ASW  after  December  2015,  the  results  do  not  imply  an  aggregate \nnegative effect of ASW. \n\nTable 5: Main Results \n\n(2) \n2.6598*** \n(0.2482) \n0.3329 \n(0.2991) \n\u20130.5865* \n(0.3384) \n0.6782* \n(0.3936) \n\u20130.0098*** \n(0.0028) \n0.4611*** \n(0.0168) \n0.0026 \n(0.0098) \n0.0180*** \n(0.0036) \n0.0021*** \n(0.0004) \n \n \n2.6624*** \n(0.6219) \n422,850 \n0.411 \n\n(3) \n2.6735*** \n(0.2482) \n0.3008 \n(0.2987) \n\u20130.5609* \n(0.3383) \n0.3529 \n(0.3940) \n\u20130.0123*** \n(0.0028) \n \n \n\u20130.0049 \n(0.0097) \n \n \n0.0034*** \n(0.0004) \n0.5825*** \n(0.0057) \n8.0341*** \n(0.2416) \n422,850 \n0.411 \n\nDependent Variable: ln(Exports) \nTreat (MY SG) \n \nPeriod \n \nTreat*Period (Jan2016) \n \nGDP Growth \n \nPPI_exporter \n \nln(Population) \n \nInflation reporter \n \nDistance to Frontier \n \nWTI \n \nAverage lending rate \n \nConstant \n \nObservations \nR-squared \n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses. \n\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. \n\n                                                 \n52  Malaysia and Singapore. \n\n(1) \n3.0143*** \n(0.2659) \n0.2378 \n(0.3112) \n\u20130.6921** \n(0.3502) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11.8555*** \n(0.2536) \n422,850 \n0.395 \n\n16 \n \n\nDestination Country-Year, Industry-Year, Destination Country-Industry fixed effects are included. \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nThis  result  can  be  explained  from  different  perspectives.  Firstly,  ASW  might  affect \nexports negatively because exporters might want to postpone their operations to make \nuse of ASW opportunities. Thus, in order take the advantage of trading through Single \nWindow exporters might delay sales in the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. This \nmight affect exports between Malaysia and Singapore in the short-run. Secondly, it is \npossible that the processing through SW is not as fast as it was expected. Moreover, \nnot all exporters might be able to fully utilize the SW application because they are not \nwell prepared (or trained). Finally, the uncertainty about how the SW application would \nwork  might  also  affect  the  negative  impact  of  its  implication.  Thus,  uninformed \nexporters might be willing to wait and observe how new application works. \n\nOne  should  notice  that  the  negative  impact  of  ASW  is  valid  only  for  short  period. \nTherefore,  one  should  interpret  these  results  as  short-run  effect  of  ASW.  Moreover, \nthere might be another common economic factor driving the results, which might have \nhappened  at  the  same  time  with  ASW.  Further  improvement  of  this  study  should  be \ndone through exploiting more data for longer time frame. Additionally, main identifying \nassumptions shall be improved as more information about the implementation of ASW \nis obtained.  \n\nThe  analysis  of  control  variables  shows  that,  GDP  growth,  population,  Distance  to \nFrontier  and  oil  prices  are  positively  associated  with  exports.  GDP  growth  proxies \naggregate output or exportable goods and population is a proxy for workforce. These \ntwo  are  important  factors  of  production  and  therefore  factors  of  exports.  Distance  to \nFrontier is a proxy for technology within a country. The better is the index, the more is \nthe probability that new businesses will emerge within a country. Moreover, new ideas \nand  new  technologies can  be  developed.  WTI  variable  shows  that  the  oil  price  has  a \npositive effect on the exports of both countries. PPI index, which is the price of goods, \nis negatively associated with exports. The negative effect might be due to better prices \noffered  for  goods  in  the  domestic  markets.  Thus,  producers  might  abstain  from \nexporting  and  selling  within  a  country  when  the  prices  for  their  goods  increase  in  the \ncountry. Average lending rate is positively associated with exports. This implies that as \nborrowing  from  banks  for  consumers  become  expensive  the  demand  for  goods  fall \nwithin  a  country.  Therefore,  producers  seek  for  foreign  buyers  to  sell  their  goods.  All \nthese control variables proxy for demand effect of exports. \n\nExport trends around ASW. In order to further analyze the variation in exports across \ngroups before and after the treatment, the effect of time trends have been examined. \nFor this purpose, exports are estimated with time trend variable which is a continuous \nvariable taking values from 1 to n for the year-month periods from January 2012 until \nMay  2016.  This  is  referred  to  as  a  general  trend  variable  and  is  reported  under  the \ncolumns  2012M1\u20132016M5  in  Table  6.  The  second  trend  variable  (reported  under \n2016M1\u20132016M5 in Table 6) starts from the implementation of ASW and ends in May \n2016. The difference of the coefficients of the trend variables shows the impact of ASW \non exports. \n\nThe  results  from  Table  6  confirm  (statistically)  the  decrease  of  exports  during  the \nsample  period;  which  can  also  be  observed  from  Figures  1  and  2.  General  trend \nvariable  is  negatively  correlated  with  exports  and  all  of  the  coefficients  are  highly \nstatistically  significant.  In  column  2  ASW  trend  variable  is  positively  associated  with \nexports  suggesting  a  positive  impact  of  ASW  on  the  exports.  However,  when  other \nfactors  of  exports  are  controlled,  ASW  trend  variable  becomes  negative  and  highly \nstatistically significant in column 6. Difference of the coefficients from column 5 and 6 is \nstatistically  significant  suggesting  ASW  trend  is  different  from  general  trend.

Thus, in these estimations it is assumed that as if ASW \nhas  been  implemented  in  all  ASEAN  countries  from  January  2016.  In  columns  (4)  to \n(6),  treatment  group  is  Malaysia  and  Singapore  and  control  group  is  other  ASEAN \ncountries.

Treat*Period variable suggests that ASW \nhas no impact on all ASEAN countries. Thus, in our restricted sample it has impact only \non those countries where it has been implemented from January 2016. The coefficients \nfrom  column  (4)  to  (6)  confirm  the  findings  of  baseline  model.

However, the expected benefits of the ASW will be \nfor both governments and business. For example, the pre-arrival information received \nwill  enable  expedited  movement  of  goods  that  would  benefit  traders.  It  will  also  allow \nthe  border  authorities  to  apply  risk  management  procedures  more  efficiently.  Most \nimportantly,  ASW  has  the  potential  to  harmonise  and  streamline  national  procedures \nthat will be beneficial for businesses. \n\nCurrently,  there  are  several  challenges  for  a  fuller  implementation  of  ASW  both  from \nparticipation  and  functional  perspectives.  The  first  challenge  is  that  ASEAN  Member \nStates are at different levels of economic development. Some of the Member States do \nnot  have  a  single  window  yet  which  can  be  integrated  into  the  ASW  environment. \nImplementing a single window at the national level is a matter of resources, expertise \nand national priority and political will.  \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nThe  second  challenge  is  that  the  ASEAN  Member  States  have  their  own  customs \nregimes and laws governing issues relevant for their respective NSW. This can pose a \nchallenge for interoperability and legal certainty. The notion of legal certainty has been \nin demand since centuries with respect to the commercial transactions. The quest for \ninduction  of  the  ubi  commercium,  ibi  ius  has  been  the  propelling  force  towards \nemergence of commercial customs and emergence of institutions for the settlement of \ncommercial  disputes. 53 In  other  words,  the  Latin  adage  reflects  the  insight  that  the \nefficiency  of  markets  and  trade  depend  on  legal  certainty.  In  the  context  of  the  ASW, \nthe  notion  of  legal  certainty  is  related  to  the  ability  of  the  businesses  to  predict  and \nascertain the meaning and effect of the legal framework. The hope is that a predictable \nrule oriented framework of the ASW will reduce risk associated with cross-border trade \nprocesses for businesses. In the same context, the success of the ASW will depend on \nhow legal regimes of ASEAN Member States interoperate, especially to support cross-\nborder transactions. In addition, some other legal issues crucial for providing the legal \nframework such as functional equivalence of paper and electronic documents, mutual \nrecognition of digital signatures, etc. still need to be addressed.  \n\nFor  the  future  of  ASW  some  interesting  suggestions  have  been  put  forward.  The  first \nand  foremost  concerns  the  enlargement  of  scope  of  regional  transactions  for  cross-\nborder  exchange  of  data  within  ASEAN  and  also  between  ASEAN  and  its  dialogue \npartners.  Other  suggestions  made  in  the  same  report  are  implementing  the  ASEAN \nCustoms  Transit  System  for  the  exchange  of  data  in  a  single  transit  declaration \ndirected to facilitate free movement of goods within the region; and launching a central \ntrade repository for trade related information that can be accessed by traders. 54  \n\nAn  important  aspect  that  merits  consideration  with  respect  to  the  ASW  is  the \nidentification of key stakeholders. The identification is important because it will help in \ndeveloping  a  business  model  for  that  can  support  the  architecture\u2019s  operation  and \nmaintenance.  UN/CEFACT  Recommendation  and  Guidelines  on  Single  Window \nInteroperability No. 36 also highlights the importance of identification of stakeholders.55 \nThe  draft  Recommendation  indicates  that  it  is  crucial  to  identify  what  stakeholders \nrequire  from  interoperability  for  the  assessment  of  feasibility.  In  such  a  case \nstakeholders\u2019 needs become the key drivers of the system. Identification of the role and \nbenefits  of  stakeholders  of  the  ASW  is  crucial  for  its  success.  Once  the  stakeholders \nand  their  needs  are  identified,  a  suitable  business  process 56  can  be  built  for  the \noperation and maintenance of the ASW.  \n\n                                                 \n53  Petersmann,  E.U.2006.

INTEGRATION OF COMMERCIAL REQUIREMENTS \n\nThe  discussion  on  stakeholders  brings  us  to  the  consideration  about  the  scope  of \nISWE.  The  question  that  arises  is:  whether  the  ISWE  environment  should  focus \nprimarily on trade regulatory issues? This question is of tremendous important because \nthe  arguable  merit  of  implementing  an  ISWE  is  for  creating  an  information  channel \nwhich  would  address  the  entire  supply  chain.  However,  the  ISWE  which  is  primarily \ndriven by has trade regulatory processes and data would entail the flow of G2G, B2G \ndata which is not inclusive of the entire supply chain operations. It is submitted that the \nfull  potential  of  ISWE  can  be  realized  through  integration  of  G2G,  B2G  and  B2B \ninformation which is possible through the interoperability between single windows that \ninclude  transport  and  commercial  requirements.  It  is  further  submitted  that  the \ncommercial aspects of international trade when enmeshed with transport requirements \nin the single windows at the country level will form the building block for an ISWE which \nwill  encompass  G2G,  B2G  and  B2B  interactions.  The  single  windows  thus  proposed \nshould function as an interface between trade, customs and transport stakeholders by \ndeveloping  extensive  inter-linkages  to  share  information.  Such  integration  will  allow \nflow  of  real-time  data  that  can  offer  numerous  possibilities  to  enhance  the  visibility  \nof  international  supply  chains.  The  inclusion  of  the  commercial  and  transport \nrequirements  in  the  ISWE  will  entail  the  participation  of  transport  stakeholders  such  \nas  carriers,  shippers,  ports,  transport  authorities,  insurance  providers,  etc.  The \nparticipation  of  such  stakeholders  is  necessary  to  make  the  integration  of  G2G,  B2G \nand B2B information possible.  \n\nRegulatory  aspects  of  transport  requirements  have  already  been  included  in  certain \nnational  single  window  systems  to  fulfil  reporting  and/or  customs  requirements.  \nFor  example,  the  EU  Maritime  Single  Window  initiative  simplifies  and  harmonizes  \nthe  administrative  procedures  applied  to  maritime  transport  by  making  electronic \ntransmission of information standard and also rationalizes ship-reporting formalities.57 It \nis noteworthy that the commercial and financial aspects of international trade which are \nenmeshed with transport are not captured through the existing transport oriented single \nwindow  initiatives.  The  question  arises  how  can  commercial  and  financial  aspects  of \ninternational  trade  connected  with  transport  be  included  alongside  the  regulatory \ntransport  requirements  in  the  ISWE.  In  the  above  context  it  is  submitted  that  the \nemergence  of  federated  cloud  computing  and  distributed  ledger  technology  has \nopened  up \nthe  complex \narrangements  of  stakeholders  in  the  transport  industry.  However,  the  enabling  legal \nframework  that  is  required  to  implement  such  technologies  for  single  windows  still \nremains  fragmented  and  incomplete  across  jurisdictions.  For  this  purpose,  the \nremainder of the paper will focus on evaluating selected issues relevant to the issue of \nintegration  of  transport  and  commercial  issue  in  the  single  window  environment  such \nas dematerialization of trade documents. It is one of the important elements connected \nto the implementation of ISWE.  \n\ntechnical  solutions \n\nthe  possibilities \n\nfor  creating \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n57  The  Reporting  Formalities  Directive  2010/65/EU requires  all  EU  Member  States  to  establish  National \nSingle  Windows  (NSW)  to  enable  ships  to  report  formalities  when  arriving  in  and/or  departing  from  \nEU ports. \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nThe  exclusion  of  the  commercial  aspects  in  existing  transport  single  windows  is \nunderstandable  as  addition  of  various  transport  stakeholders  into  the  single  window \nsystem would require complex coordination that can capture the prevalent relationships \nbetween  carrier  interests,  shipper  interests,  ports,  transport  authorities,  insurance \nproviders,  etc.,  from  legal  and  technical  perspectives.  Although  emergence  of  new \ntechnology  has  opened  up  the  possibilities  for  creating  technical  solutions  for  such \ncomplex  arrangements,  the  lack  of  enabling  national  laws  on  transport  and  e-\ncommerce in most jurisdictions pose a challenge. \n\n5.1  Electronic Bill of Lading \n\nTo illustrate the legal complexity from transport law and e-commerce law perspectives, \nthe  situation  to  develop  electronic  bills  of  lading  is  briefly  examined.  A  bill  of  lading \nperforms three functions, namely, it serves as evidence of the contract of carriage, acts \nas  receipt  for  the  goods,  and  is  a  document  of  title.  The  first  two  functions  are  easily \nreplicated  electronically  as  they  essentially  relate  to  transfer  of  information.  The \nchallenge lies in replicating the document of title function. Bills of lading embodied with \nthe  title  function  have  served  various  essential  practical  purposes  in  the  commercial \nworld for several centuries. Traditionally, bills of lading acquired their powers to transfer \nrights represented in them through mercantile usage. This usage transcended national \nbarriers. The use of such documents achieved the same result in different jurisdictions \nacross the world, which was necessary if cross-border trade was to proceed smoothly. \nThe advent of a bill of lading responded precisely to the requirements of the business \ncommunity,  and became a tool that the domestic laws of various countries eventually \ncame to recognise to achieve the effects that the lex mercatoria attributed to it.58 \n\n5.1.1  Title Function \n\nThe  title  function  denotes  three  uses  of  a  bill  of  lading.  First,  possession  of  the \ndocument constitutes constructive possession and control over the goods. Second, the \ndocument  may  be  used  to  transfer  title  to  the  goods.  Third,  the  document  is  used  to \nprovide  security  in  the  goods  to  financial  institutions  involved  in  providing  credit  to \ninternational sale transactions.59 \n\nThe above discussion clarifies that the bill of lading, in addition to being the transport \ndocument issued by the carrier to the shipper, serves essential trade functions for the \nconsignor, consignee and banks. Therefore, the questions that arise are - How can the \nlegal  concept  of  a  bill  of  lading  be  dematerialised?  How  can  the  dematerialised \ninformation  be  channelized  to  fulfil  the  trade  functions  in  an  electronic  business \nenvironment?  \n\n5.1.2  BPO and SCF \n\nThe banking industry has made attempts to answer the above two questions for a while \nand developed contractual mechanisms to create electronic bill of lading platforms that \nalso  offer  trade  finance  services  to  international  traders.60 One  such  service  is  called \n                                                 \n58  For a detailed discussion see Basu Bal, A. 2014.

It has now grown into a cloud-based platform  which  optimizes \ncomplex international trade chains by providing a multi-bank solution for trade finance processes.

However, BPO has mostly benefitted rated multinational corporations \nand  not  SMEs.63 It  can  be  gleaned  from  the  above  illustration  that  a  pure  contractual \napproach  to  form  a  club  may  be  less  complicated  when  implementing  evolving \ntechnology  but  may  result  in  a  non-inclusive  environment. 64 Therefore,  a  governing \nlegal framework for electronic bill of lading is necessary and in its absence SMEs are \ndenied a level playing field in global supply chains.  \n\n5.1.3  Rotterdam Rules \n\nInternational institutions have made attempts to create a governing legal framework for \nuse  of  electronic  bills  of  lading  in  international  trade.  In  2008,  the  United  Nations \nGeneral  Assembly  adopted  the  \u201cUnited  Nations  Convention  on  Contracts  for  the \nInternational Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea,\u201d65 otherwise referred to as the \n\u201cRotterdam  Rules.\u201d  One  of  the  objectives  of  the  Rotterdam  Rules  is  to  facilitate  \ne-commerce  by  establishing  a  legal  framework  for  electronic  bills  of  lading. 66  The \nprovisions on electronic transport records in chapters 3 and 8 of the Rotterdam Rules \nare  specifically  designed  to  fill  the  gap  in  the  area  of  carriage  of  goods  in  relation  to  \ne-commerce.  The  Rules  also  contain  three  separate  chapters  dealing with  delivery  of \nthe goods, the rights of a controlling party, and the transfer of rights,67 which may also \n\n                                                 \n61  The  BPO  is  a  standardized  interbank  instrument,  which  is  based  on  electronic  information.  Unlike  a \nletter of credit, which requires that physical trade documents are manually examined, the BPO requires \naccess  to  electronic  trade  data.  This  data  is  controlled,  verified  and  matched  over  time  in  a  highly \nautomated process as new electronic trade data are submitted about progress of the underlying trade \ntransaction.  For  a  brief  discussion  on  BPO  see  Senechai  T.,  and  Casterman,  A.,  Bank  Payment \nInternational  Chamber  of  Commerce  http://icc.tobb.org.tr/docs/Bank%20Payment \nObligation, \n%20Obligation.pdf (accessed 14 April 2017) \n\n62  SCF  is  defined  as  the  inter-company  optimisation  of  financing  as  well  as  the  integration  of  financing \nprocesses  with  customers,  suppliers,  and  service  providers  in  order  to  increase  the  value  of  all \nparticipating  companies\u201d.

The  creation  of  the  Rotterdam  Rules  \nwas  initiated  by  the  Comit\u00e9  Maritime  International  (CMI)  and  was  subsequently  passed  on  to  the \nUNCITRAL  Working  Group  III  (Transport  Law).  The  principal  goal  underlying  the  development  of  the \nRules  is  the  creation  of  a  modern  and  uniform  law  concerning  the  international  carriage  of  goods  by \nsea,  in  order  to  reduce  transaction  costs,  increase  predictability  and  stability,  and  engender  greater \ncommercial  confidence  in  international  maritime  commerce.  The  Rotterdam  Rules  have  so  far  \nreceived  25  signatures  and  3  ratifications,  by  a  mix  of  developing  and  developed  countries,  including \nstrong  seafaring  and  trading  nations,  as  well  as  traditional  carrier  and  shipper  nations.  See  \nthe  Rotterdam  Rules\u201d  http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/transport_goods/ \n\u201cStatus  of \nrotterdam_status.html  (accessed  14  April  2017).  Pursuant  to  article  94,  the  Convention  requires \nratification or accession by at least 20 states to enter into force.  \n\n66  The Rotterdam Rules uses the term \u201cnegotiable transport documents\u201d to refer to bills of lading and the \nterm \u201cnon-negotiable transport documents\u201d to refer to sea waybills. The Rules uses the term \u201celectronic \ntransport records\u201d to refer to the electronic equivalent of bills of lading.  \n\n67  Chapters 9, 10 and 11 of the Rotterdam Rules. \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nserve  as  a  way  to  solve  the  problem  of  how  to  provide  for  negotiable  electronic \ntransport records.68  \n\n5.1.4  Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records \n\nIn  order  to  benefit  the  promotion  of  electronic  communications  in  international  trade, \nUNCITRAL Working Group IV on Electronic Commerce in November 2016 finalized the \nModel  Law  on  Electronic  Transferable  Records. 69 This  Model  Law  aims  to  facilitate \ndematerialization  of  all  paper-based  transferable  documents  or  instruments  that  allow \nto claim the payment of a sum or the delivery of goods.70 One of the difficult issues that \nthis  Model  Law  will  resolve  relate  to  the  requirement  of  physical  possession  of  the \npaper document. Article 10 of the Model Law provides a functional equivalence rule for \nthe  possession  of  a  transferable  document  or  instrument.  Functional  equivalence  of \npossession is achieved when a reliable method is employed to establish control of that \nrecord  by  a  person  and  to  identify  the  person  in  control.  The  notion  of  control  when \nused  as  a  substitute  for  possession  requires  a  reliable  method  for  identifying  the \ncurrent  party  in  control  of  a  specific  electronic  record  as  the  said  notion  typically \nfocuses  on  the  identity  of  the  person  entitled  to  enforce  the  rights  embodied  in  the \nelectronic  transferable  record. 71 The  method  of  identification  may  be  accomplished \nthrough  a  closed  system72,  or  through  an  open  system73.  Under  the  draft  model  law, \nthe  notion  of  original  and  uniqueness  has  been  connected  to  control.  Emphasis  has \nbeen  given  to  reliably  ensure  that  the  claim  may  be  presented  to  the  debtor  only \nonce.74 \n\n5.2  SMEs Still Use Paper and are Excluded from SCF  \n\nfunctional  equivalence  and \n\nThe Rotterdam Rules and the Model Law follows the principles of non-discrimination of \nthe \nelectronic  means, \ninstruments  may  be  applied  to  electronic  bills  of  lading  once  States  implement  them. \nSo far, leading maritime nations have not ratified the Rotterdam Rules. The Model Law \nwould be ready for use by States to draft their national legislation once the UNCITRAL \nCommission adopts it next year. It is submitted that certain maritime stakeholders have \nshown  limited  enthusiasm  in  accepting  the  Rotterdam  Rules,  which  has  attributed  to \nlarge  trading  nations  such  as  United  States  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  not \n\ntechnology  neutrality.

A block chain ledger displays the addresses in which tokens are kept, the \naddresses  are  cryptographic  identities  (pseudonyms),  and  the  private  keys  corresponding  to  the \naddresses  are  secret.  See Takahashi,  K.  2016.  Blockchain Technology  and  Electronic  Bills  of  Lading. \nJournal of International Maritime Law 22: 209. \n\n74  See draft Article 11, A/CN.9/WG.IV/WP.139/Add.1, note 28 above. \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 744 \n \n\nBal, Rajput, and Alizada \n\nratifying  the  Rules.75 Also,  during  the  negotiation  and  drafting  of  the  Model  Law,  the \ntransport  and  banking  industry  had  low-level  of  participation  in  the  Working  Group  IV \nsessions. 76  Most  of  the  discussions  were  based  on  theoretical  considerations  of \nexisting paper-based rules. At any rate, the answer to the first question of how can the \nlegal concept of a bill of lading be dematerialised can be found in the Rotterdam Rules \nand the Model Law.  \n\nThe  answer  to  the  second  question  -  how  can  the  dematerialised  information  be \nchannelized  to  fulfil  the  trade  functions  in  an  electronic  business  environment  -  still \nremains  to  be  answered.  Policymakers  alone  cannot  answer  this  question.  But,  the \ncrucial question that policymakers should ask with respect to the Rotterdam Rules and \nthe  Model  Law  is  whether  they  can  create  the  momentum  for  SMEs  as  the  lack  of  a \ngoverning legal framework is affecting them the most.  \n\nLarge enterprises see value in using electronic data interchange (EDI) provide by large \nlogistics  service  providers,  such  as  DHL  or  UPS.  These  large  logistics  service \nproviders  have  their  enterprise  resource  planning  (ERP),  transport  management  and \nlogistics  systems  that  are  connected  to  the  ERP  system  of  the  large  enterprise  at  \none  end  and  with  customs  and  port  authorities  interface  on  the  other  end.  Generally, \nSMEs do not have advanced internal ERP systems and do not use the services of such \nlarge  logistics  service  providers.  They  continue  to  use  a  mix  of  electronic  and  paper \nbased  information  and  documentary  exchange,  which  puts  them  at  a  competitive \ndisadvantage  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  large  enterprises.  Moreover,  as  discussed  above  the \nbenefits of new financing techniques such as SCF are not efficiently extended to SMEs \nas they are outside the range of electronic visibility. BPO in its present form is suited for \nlarge  enterprises  that  have  a  high  volume  or  value  of  trade  with  established \ncounterparties.  The  small  suppliers  who  feed  into  the  supply  chains  of  such  large \nenterprises generally do not participate in SCF.77 \n\n5.3  ISWE May Help SMEs  \n\nThis  paper  has  argued  earlier  that  the  merit  of  implementing  ISWE  is  to  create  an \ninformation interaction infrastructure that would facilitate the entire supply chain. Also, it \nhas  been  pointed  out  that  the  regulatory  aspects  of  transport  requirements  have \nalready  been  included  in  certain  national  single  window  systems  to  fulfil  reporting \n\n                                                 \n75  One of the authors of this paper attended the sessions of UNCITRAL Working Group III (Transport Law) \nthat deliberated on the Rotterdam Rules and UNCITRAL Working Group IV (Electronic Commerce) that \ndeliberated  on  the  Model  Law  on  Electronic  Transferable  Records  as  an  accredited  observer.  The \nopinions expressed in this article are entirely those of him and are not attributable to any institution or \norganization with which he may be associated in any capacity. He is also part of a research project on \nelectronic transport records at the School of Business, Economics and Law, University of Gothenburg, \nwhich is currently investigating the role of logistics service providers in enhancing supply chain finance. \nWhile conducting research for the project he has interviewed several members of the maritime industry \nin the United States.  \n\n76  UNCITRAL  Working  Groups  are  composed  of  delegates  from  States,  international  governmental \norganizations and invited international non-governmental organizations. Generally, industry participation \nis  facilitated  through  observers  from  international  non-governmental  organizations  who  represent  the \nviews of their organizations on matters where the organization concerned has expertise or international \nexperience so as to facilitate the deliberations. \n\n77  One  empirical  study  in  India  has  shown  that  small  suppliers  face  several  challenges  which  relate  to \nhuman  resource;  technology  and  information  technology;  finance;  inter  and  intra-firm  coordination; \ncollaboration  and  alliance;  organizational  policy,  strategies  and  practices;  and  macro-institutional.  \nSee  More,  D.  and  Basu,  P.  2013.

However,  the  commercial  and  financial  aspects  of \ninternational trade that are enmeshed with transport remain excluded in such transport \noriented  single  window  initiatives.  To  include  such  aspects  of  international  trade  in \nISWE,  it  has  to  be  ensured  that  there  exists  legally  significant  trusted  transboundary \nelectronic interaction.78  \n\ntransboundary  electronic \n\nTrusted  transboundary  electronic  interaction  is  possible  if  interoperability  is  agreed  at \npolitical, legal, organizational, semantic and technical levels. As explained above, large \nenterprises  have  already  achieved \ninteraction \ntrusted \ncontractually.  However,  to  be  able  to  include  SMEs  in  such  interactions,  the  issue  of \nlegal  interoperability  of  trust  has  to  be  aligned  through  a  legal  framework  so  that \nexchanged data is accorded proper legal weight across jurisdictions. UNCITRAL  may \nserve  as  a  forum  to  create  such  legal  framework  for  establishing  necessary  level  of \ntrust  between  the  participants  of  the  trusted  infrastructure  that  will  ensure  legal \nsignificance  of \nin  different \njurisdictions.  Also,  organizational  interoperability  and  semantic  interoperability  will \nrequire  preparation  of  recommendations  that  can  be  agreed  and  understood  by  all \nparties. UN/CEFACT may take a leading role to prepare recommendations on how to \nbuild  and  manage  national  trust  infrastructures  in  a  best  way  so  they  would  be \ninteroperable with each other for trade facilitation.  \n\ntransboundary  electronic  exchange  of  data \n\nissued \n\nIn  2015,  several  proposals  were  submitted  to  UNCITRAL  recommending  that  it \nundertake a project to develop a basic legal framework covering identity management \nand trust services as well as of cloud computing to facilitate international cross-border \ninteroperability.79 Working Group IV has now been tasked to move forward with such a \nproject.80  \n\nAnother  effort  worth  noting  is  the  Framework  Agreement  on  Facilitation  of  Cross-\nBorder  Paperless  Trade  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,81 which  was  adopted  by  UN/ESCAP \nand is open for signature from 1 October 2016. Article 1 of the Agreement states that \nthe  objective  is  to  facilitate  cross-border  paperless  trade  by  enabling  data  exchange \nand mutual recognition of electronic trade data among willing ESCAP member States \nthrough  dedicated  intergovernmental  framework  to  develop  legal  and  technical \nsolutions.  This  Agreement  provide  ESCAP  member  States  with  a  digital  complement \nfor  better  implementation  of  the  WTO  TFA  as  well  as  on-going  bilateral  and  sub-\nregional initiatives, such as the ASW. Article 5 of the Agreement sets out the general \nprinciples  to  facilitate  interoperability  between  paperless  trade  systems  and  to  ensure \nthat  solutions  developed  under  the  agreement  lead  both  to  higher  levels  of  trade \nfacilitation and regulatory compliance.

CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nThis  paper  considered  only  a  sampling  of  the  work  currently  being  done  on  single \nwindows  and  associated  issues.  There  are  several  initiatives  focused  on  single \nwindow,  paperless  trade  and  e-commerce  issues  carried  out  in  various  parts  of  the \nworld. What may be found in all such initiatives are a number of interwoven commercial \nand trade law issues that may need to be addressed. The entry into force of the TFA \nmay  serve  as  impetus  to  engage  in  the  preparation  of  a  multilateral  Framework \nAgreement to provide the legal basis for ISWE. UNCITRAL has recently started work \non  identity  management  and  trust  services  as  well  as  cloud  computing  to  facilitate \ncross-border  interoperability.  In  the  coming  years  this  effort  may  ensure  legally \nsignificant  trusted  transboundary  electronic  interaction  to  include  the  commercial  and \ntransport aspects in ISWE. \n\nInternational  and  regional  institutions  are  increasingly  cooperating  to  work  for  global \ntrade in the digital economy. In this context the interaction between law and institutions \nshould be explored in transformative contexts. The transformation may be the manner \nin which the functions of institutions may change over time; how institutions may act as \nagents  of  transformation;  and  how  institutions  themselves  can  be  subjected  to \ntransformation. If WTO decides to take up the work for creating ISWE, then it would be \ntransformation  of  an  institution  engaged  in  reducing  tariff  barriers  to  an  institution \ninvolved  in  reducing  information  barriers  in  international  trade.  If  UNCITRAL  has  to \ntransform as an institution engaged in the modernization and harmonization of rules on \ninternational business, it has to lay emphasis on equality of opportunities for business \nactors  participating  in  international  trade.  Working  Group  I  of  UNCITRAL,  which  is \ncurrently engaged in creating rules that would simplify incorporation and develop good \npractices  in  business  registration  of  micro,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(MSMEs) has stepped in that direction. It is hoped that in the future all other Working \nGroups  of  UNCITRAL,  in  addition  to  what  they  do,  will  also  explore  whether  the \nharmonized rules in their respective domain of work promote equality of opportunities \nfor businesses.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n82  See note 80 in p. 49. \n\n28 \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Abhinayan  Basu  Bal  and  Trisha  Rajput  are  assistant  professors  at  the  Department  of \nLaw  and  Parviz  Alizada  is  a  doctoral  candidate  at  the  Department  of  Business \nAdministration in the School of Business, Economics and Law, University of Gothenburg, \nSweden. \n", "The  views  expressed  in  this  paper  are  the  views  of  the  author  and  do  not  necessarily \nreflect  the  views  or  policies  of  ADBI,  ADB,  its  Board  of  Directors,  or  the  governments \nthey represent.

The purpose \nof this paper is to review the legal framework necessary for implementing international single \nwindow environment (ISWE) and, in that context, examine particular economic and financial \naspects of the current developments. The discussion shows that ISWE is desirable as it may \ncontribute  towards  creating  a  level  playing  field  for  SMEs  participating  in  global  supply \nchains.  \n \nThe  paper  discusses  ASEAN  Single  Window  to  identify  prospects  and  challenges,  and \nhighlight  the  legal  and  economic  viability  of  interoperability.  ASW  is  examined  from \ntransaction  cost  and  information  asymmetry  theory  perspectives  to  provide  a  methodology \nfor  conducting  empirical  analysis  at  country-level.  Based  on  the  findings  the  paper  argues \nthat  full  potential  of  ISWE  can  be  realised  through  integration  of  transport  and  commercial \nrequirements  thereby  improving  G2G,  B2G  and  B2B  information  flows.  Nevertheless,  such \nintegration  would  require  the  ability  to  capture  the  complex  relationships  between  various \ntransport actors from legal and technical standpoints.  \n \nTo  illustrate  this  legal  complexity  from  transport  and  e-commerce  law  angle,  the \ndisadvantageous  position  of  SMEs  vis-\u00e0-vis  use  of  electronic  bills  of  lading  and  access  to \nsupply chain finance is examined. A critical analysis of selected legal texts is made through \nthe  lens  of  recent  developments  such  as  distributed  ledger  and  cloud  technologies  to \nsuggest  solutions  for  SMEs.  The  conclusion  highlights  that  transport  and  commercial \nrequirements  in  the  ISWE  has  to  be  incorporated  through  laws  made  for  e-commerce  and \nnot  through  a  piecemeal  approach  that  replicate  the  functions  of  paper  documents  in  an \nelectronic environment. \n \nKeywords: single window, SME, ASEAN single window, transport single window, supply \nchain finance, electronic bill of lading, international single window environment \n \nJEL Classification: F13, P45 \n \n", " \n"]}
