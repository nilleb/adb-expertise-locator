The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  alone  accounts  for  about  30%  of  the \nelectricity  generated  for  the  entire  region,  and  six  countries\u2014Australia,  the  PRC,  India,  Japan,  the \nRepublic  of  Korea,  and  the  Russian  Federation\u2014account  for  87%  of  generated  electricity.  When \nanalyzed as per capita figures, houses in New Zealand or Australia consume 100 times more electricity \nthan those in Bangladesh and Myanmar.  The region is also home to small island developing states like \nFiji and Vanuatu that are extremely difficult to supply with modern energy services. These countries, \nheavily  dependent  on  diesel  imports  with  exceptionally  small  electricity  grids  and  low  levels  of \naffordable  access,  are  spread  across  about  a  third  of  the  earth\u2019s  surface  but  are  home  to  less  than  a \nthousandth  of  the  world\u2019s  population.  What  sorts  of  energy  technologies  can  provide  access  and \naddress  these  concerns?  Moreover,  what  case  studies  of  success  exist  for  Asian  countries  to  learn \nfrom? \n\n \nTo  provide  some  answers,  this  working  paper  assesses  the  positive  cobenefits  of  promoting \ngreen  and  clean  energy  in  Asia.  It  first  defines  what  is  meant  by  \u201cclean\u201d  energy  across  the  four \ntechnological systems of cooking, renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and urban transport. Then, \ndrawn  from  a  synthesis  of  peer-reviewed  articles,  it  summarizes  at  least  four  cobenefits\u2014defined  as \npositive,  social,  or  economic  spillovers  that  occur  in  addition  to  merely  the  provision  of  energy\u2014to \ninvesting in these types of systems. These include (i) diversification and enhanced energy security, (ii) \njobs  and  green  growth,  (iii)  displaced  pollution  and  associated  cost  savings,  and  (iv)  enhanced \nresilience  and  adaptive  capacity  to  things  like  climate  change  and  natural  disasters.  The  paper  also \noffers some insight into possible challenges and trade-offs that must be managed when attempting to \ncapture  cobenefits.  The  paper  then  focuses  on  four  case  studies  of  cobenefits  delivered  in  practice: \nliquefied  petroleum  gas  stoves  in  Indonesia,  renewable  electricity  generation  in  the  PRC,  energy \nefficiency in Japan, and mass transit in Singapore. Table 1 offers an overview of the historical period, a \ndescription,  and  results  of  these  cases.  The  paper  concludes  with  insights  for  energy  analysts  and \npolicy makers.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nTopic Area \nCooking \n\nCase \nStudy \nIndonesia   \n\nPeriod \n2007\u2013\n2012 \n\nTable 1: Programmatic Summary of Exemplary Asian Case Studies \n \n\nDescription \n\nUnder the leadership of Vice-President \nJusuf Kalla, the Indonesian LPG \nMegaproject offered households the right \nto receive a free \u201cinitial package\u201d \nconsisting of a 3-kilogram LPG cylinder, a \nfirst free gas fill, one burner stove, a hose, \nand a regulator. The government, in \ntandem, also started repealing kerosene \nsubsidies (increasing its price) and \nconstructing new refrigerated LPG \nterminals to act as national distribution \nhubs. \nThe Twelfth Five-Year Plan (FYP), \nadopted by the PRC government in \nMarch 2011, has continued the country\u2019s \nsupport for renewable energy and further \nbrought environmental and climate-\noriented concerns to the forefront of \nnational policy. New renewable energy \nproduction has been driven by the \nemergence of carbon trading platforms \nand international treaties such as the \nKyoto Protocol. \nThe \u201cTop Runner\u201d program sets energy \nefficiency standards for 19 different \nproducts and within a time period \nmandated by the government requires \nefficiency performance to improve across \ncovered products.

Though  the  term  \u201cimproved\u201d  is  subjective,  modern  stoves  take  a  variety  of \nforms.  Sanchez  (2010)  argues  that  an  \u201cimproved\u201d  cooking  source  is  one  that  requires  less  than  4- \nperson hours per week per household to collect fuel, has a conversion efficiency above 25%, and meets \nWorld  Health  Organization  guidelines  for  air  quality.  Improved  or  clean  stoves  therefore  frequently \nrequire a switch away from charcoal or polluted wood to \u201chealthier\u201d fuels such as soft biomass, crop \nresidues,  and  firewood;  they  have  a  grate  and  an  improved  combustion  chamber;  and  they  almost \nalways have a chimney. They utilize higher temperature ceramics, fire-resistant material, longer-lasting \nmetals, and possess more insulation and a better frame that guides hot gases closer to cooking pots. \nThey can cook more food at once and many have coils around the combustion chamber to heat water \nwhile cooking is in process. Some improved stoves are connected to radiators or space heaters so that \nheat  could  be  recycled  and/or  vented  to  other  rooms,  and  some  stoves  send  heat  through  pipes \ndirectly into a brick platform that occupants sleep on at night (Brown and Sovacool 2011).  \n \nB.  \n \nRenewable  electricity  is  dependent  on  nondepletable  fuels  that  can  be  utilized  through  a  variety  of \nsources, approaches, systems, and technologies; in each case, renewing at a rate faster than they are \nconsumed.1  Plants and algae can capture sunlight for photosynthesis before they convert it to biofuels \nor  biopower.  Hydropower  capitalizes  on  the  rain  and  snowfall  resulting  from  water  evaporation  and \ntranspiration. Wind generates electricity directly by turning a turbine or indirectly in the form of ocean \nwaves, but the wind itself is driven by the sun. Tides go up and down due to the gravitational attraction \nbetween the oceans and the moon. The heat trapped in the earth itself can be put to productive use \nthrough geothermal applications. \n \n\nRenewable Electricity \n\nOperators and analysts generally categorize electricity systems according to their fuel sources, \nas shown in Table 2: wind turbines (onshore and offshore); solar energy (including solar photovoltaic \npanels,  solar  thermal  systems,  and  concentrated  solar  power);  geothermal  (conventional  and \nadvanced); biomass (including landfill gas, agricultural waste, refuse, energy crops, as well as biofuels \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel); hydroelectricity (large and small); and ocean power. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   While often characterized as relying on renewal through natural processes, some renewables in fact can rely upon or be \nenhanced by human assistance to natural processes. An example would be multi-species reforestation to offset a wood-\nfired electricity generating system.  \n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nTable 2: Renewable Electricity Technologies and Associated Fuel Cycles \n \n\nSource  \nOnshore wind   Wind turbines capture the kinetic energy of the air and convert it into \n\nDescription\n\nelectricity via a turbine and generator. \n\nOffshore wind  \n\nOffshore wind turbines operate in the same manner as onshore systems but \nare moored or stabilized to the ocean floor.  \n\nFuel\n\nWind  \n\nWind  \n\nSolar \nphotovoltaic \n(PV)  \nSolar thermal  \n\nSolar photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electrical energy through the use \nof semiconductor wafers.  \n\nSunlight  \n\nSolar thermal systems use mirrors and other reflective surfaces to concentrate \nsolar radiation, utilizing the resulting high temperatures to produce steam that \ndirectly powers a turbine The three most common generation technologies are \nparabolic troughs, power towers, and dish-engine systems.  \n\nSunlight  \n\nGeothermal \n(conventional)  \n\nAn electrical-grade geothermal system is one that can generate electricity by \nmeans of driving a turbine with geothermal fluids heated by the earth\u2019s crust.  \n\nGeothermal (ad-\nvanced)  \n\nDeep geothermal generators utilize engineered reservoirs that have been \ncreated to extract heat from water while it comes into contact with hot rock \nand returns to the surface through production wells.  \n\nBiomass  \n(combustion)  \n\nBiomass generators combust to biological material to produce electricity, \nsometimes gasifying it prior to combustion to increase efficiency  \n\nBiomass  \n(digestion)  \n\nBiomass \n(biofuels) \n\nBiomass plants generate electricity from landfill gas and anaerobic digestion.  \n\nLiquid fuels manufactured from various feedstocks \n\nHydrothermal fluids \nheated by the earth\u2019s \ncrust  \nHydrothermal fluids \nheated by the earth\u2019s \ncrust  \n\nAgricultural residues, \nwood chips, forest \nwaste, and energy \ncrops  \nMunicipal  \nand industrial wastes \nand trash  \n\nCorn, sugarcane, \nvegetable oil, and other \ncellulosic material  \n\nHydroelectric  \n\nHydroelectric dams impede the flow of water and regulate its flow to \ngeneration electricity.  \n\nWater  \n  \n\nOcean  \npower  \n\nOcean, tidal, wave, and thermal power systems utilize the movement of ocean \ncurrents and heat of ocean waters to produce electricity.  \n\nSaline water\n  \n\nEnergy Efficiency \n\nSource: Modified from Sovacool, Benjamin K. 2008. The Dirty Energy Dilemma. Westport, CT: Praegar. \n \nC.  \n \nEnergy  efficiency  refers  to  the  long-term  reduction  in  electricity  consumption  as  a  result  of  the \nincreased deployment or  improved performance of energy-efficient equipment (Brown, Southworth, \nand Stovall 2005). By reducing electricity consumption, energy efficiency is a low-cost contributor to \nsystem  adequacy\u2014the  ability  of  the  electric  system  to  supply  the  aggregate  energy  demand  at  all \ntimes\u2014because  it  reduces  the  baseload  as  well  as  the  peak  power  demand.  This  reduction  in  peak \npower  requirements  can  also  contribute  to  system  security\u2014the  ability  of  the  system  to  withstand \nsudden  disturbances\u2014by  reducing  the  load  and  stress  at  various  points  in  the  power  distribution \nsystem,  thereby  decreasing  the  likelihood  of  failures.  As  one  influential  report  on  efficiency  put  it, \n\u201c\u2026 energy-efficiency  opportunities  are  typically  physical,  long-lasting  changes  to  buildings  and \nequipment  that  result  in  decreased  energy  use  while  maintaining  constant  levels  of  energy  service\u201d \n(Rufo and Coito 2002, 1-1). \n \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   5 \n\nA close corollary of energy efficiency, demand side management, refers to programs that allow \nutilities  to  better  match  their  demand  with  their  generating  capacity.  By  changing  the  load  curve  for \nutilities,  system  reliability  can  be  enhanced  and  new  power  plant  construction  can  be  avoided  or \ndelayed. Current programs tend to aim at limiting peak electricity loads, shifting peak loads to off-peak \nhours,  or  encouraging  consumers  to  change  demand  in  response  to  changes  in  the  utilities\u2019  cost  of \nproviding power (Gillingham, Newell, and Palmer 2004). \n\n \nAnother variant is demand response, which refers to curtailment or other immediate steps that \nare aimed at reducing the peak megawattage of load (Brown and Sovacool 2008). Real-time demand\u2013\nresponse programs allow  consumers to respond to electricity prices directly, offering mechanisms to \nhelp  manage  the  electricity  load  in  times  of  peak  electricity  demand  to  improve  market  efficiency, \nincrease  reliability,  and  relieve  grid  congestion.  Significant  consumer  benefits  also  accrue  from  real-\ntime demand\u2013response programs, chiefly in the form of cost savings because of lower peak electricity \nprices,  less  opportunity  for  market  manipulation  by  electricity  providers,  and  additional  financial \nincentives to induce their participation in these programs (Goldman et al. 2005). \n\n \nLow-Carbon Transit and Mobility  \n\nD.  \n \nDue to its complexity, transport planners generally argue that \u201clow-carbon\u201d  or \u201csustainable\u201d involves \none of four tracks (Woodcock et al. 2007): One is improving the energy efficiency of transport modes \nand technologies, either through accelerated innovation or radical component substitution (e.g., hybrid \nelectric  vehicles,  fuel  cell  vehicles,  and  biofuel  for  transport).  Some  of  this  can  focus  on  existing \ntechnologies rather than entirely new or novel ones. Although most major automobile manufacturers \nhave  released  electric  vehicles  (EVs),  they  also  market  an  array  of  increasingly  fuel-efficient  models \npropelled  by  blended  fuels  or  hybrid  technology.  Given  the  difficulty  of  transforming  infrastructure \nsystems,  EV  critics  argue  that  similar  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  reductions  can  be  gained  by  improving \nconventional  internal  combustion  engine  (ICE)  technology  and  shifting  to  flex  fuels.  A  number  of \nemerging  technologies  are  expected  to  significantly  improve  ICE  vehicle  efficiency  over  the  next  2 \ndecades (Bandivadekar et al. 2008). In addition, reductions in vehicle weight, improved aerodynamics, \nand  size  decreases  could  improve  fuel  efficiency.  It  has  been  estimated  that  a  20%  vehicle  weight \nreduction  in  an  average  vehicle  is  possible  over  the  next  25  years,  producing  a  further  12%\u201320% \nreduction in fuel consumption. \n \n\nA second is reducing car use through a modal shift, especially to things like \u201cactive transport\u201d \nand bicycling. Active transport holds significant potential to both improve health and lower transport-\nenergy  use. Advocates  of  a  new  transport  paradigm  suggest  that  far  better transport  strategies  exist, \nones that promote human fitness and better transport efficiency, and include a mix of walking, cycling, \nand  public  buses  and  trains.  Figure  1  quantifies  the  enhanced  transport  efficiencies  and  reduced \nemissions associated with various modes of transport including walking, cycling, electronic bikes, and \nlight rail.   \n \n\nAnother  is  reducing  trip  lengths  through  (nontransport)  innovations  such  as  compact  cities \nand  smart  cities.  These  studies  suggest  that  urban  form  and  infrastructure  is  key  to  transport \nsustainability.  Higher-density  land  use  is  inherently  more  energy-efficient  because  distances  are \nshorter. Combined with developments in public transport, higher density enables a more frequent and \nhigher-occupancy  public  transport  with  lower  emissions  per  passenger.  Mixed-use  developments, \nbetter  housing  location  and  building  design,  and  support  for  local  services  that  can  reduce  travel \ndistances to employment, education, health services, and shops are all part of this strategy (Woodcock \net al. 2007). \n\n \n\n\f6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nFigure 1: Energy and Carbon Intensity of Transportation \nModes \n \n\n10,000\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n0\n\ne-bike\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nEfficiency (BTUs/passenger mile)\n\nEmissions (grams CO2e/passenger km)\n\n \nBTU = British thermal unit, CO2e = carbon dioxide equivalent, EV = electric vehicle, \nkm = kilometer, US = United States. \nSource: Modified from Cleveland, Cutler J., and Christopher G.

Such studies tend to suggest that avoiding vehicle trips can be met through things \nlike  information  and  communication  technology  (e.g.,  teleconferencing)  that  can  replace  physical \ntravel with electronic communication.  \n\n \n \n\nIII.  \n\nACADEMIC LITERATURE ON COBENEFITS AND TRADE-OFFS \n\n \nThe  four  technologies\u2014cleaner  cooking  stoves,  renewable  electricity,  efficiency,  and  transport\u2014not \nonly provide energy or mobility, but also have an array of \u201ccobenefits.\u201d  This refers to the positive side \neffects, secondary benefits, collateral benefits, or associated benefits from a particular green policy or \nclean  energy  system  (Miyatsuka  and  Zusman  2010).  Cobenefits  can  be  direct  or  indirect,  as  well  as \nmonetary or nonmonetary. A useful classification of cobenefits is provided by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB  and  ADBI  2013,  chapter  4),  which  notes  that  \u201cLevel  1\u201d  cobenefits  can  refer  to \ncircumstances where cobenefits are roughly proportional to the amount of investment, such as jobs or \nimprovements  to  health.  \u201cLevel  2\u201d  cobenefits  are  more  abstract  and  need  not  always  be  tied  to  the \nscale of  investment, but are required to reach a particular  level, such as achieving energy security or \nindependence  from  particular  imports.  \u201cLevel  3\u201d  cobenefits  can  refer  to  multiplier  benefits  that  are \ninterlinked with many causal factors and are not easy to quantify, such as enhancements to national \ncompetitiveness or innovation.  \n \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   7 \n\nDespite these differing levels and types of cobenefits, the idea is that investments in clean and \ngreen energy produce benefits beyond the energy system and can include reductions in emissions, cost \nsavings,  jobs,  improvements  to  health,  and  a  reduced  risk  of  climate  change  (Reinhardt  1999).  As \nPresident of the United States Barack Obama put it, \u201ca transition to clean energy is good for business\u201d \n(Lewis 2014). Similarly, World Bank Group President Jim Yong  Kim argues that there is no trade-off \nwhen it comes to transitioning to clean technology: \u201cwe believe it\u2019s possible to reduce emissions and \ndeliver jobs and economic opportunity, while also cutting health care and energy costs.\u201d2 Although the \ncobenefits offered by clean energy systems are diverse and difficult to value and monetize, we briefly \nsurvey  them  across  four  categories:  energy  security,  green  growth,  environmental  pollution  such  as \nclimate  change  and  the  degradation  of  air  quality,  and  resilience.  Cobenefits  also  have  some \ncomplexities discussed in section III.E. To be sure, these cobenefits are not the only ones; others that \nmay deserve exploration in future research include:  \n\nfuel availability and/or stability and predictability of prices, \nenergy payback ratios or energy returns on investment \n\n \n\u2022  preservation of land use and wildlife, \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  modularity and quicker construction times, \n\u2022 \nlearning curves and rates of improvement, \n\u2022 \nenhanced reliability and the avoidance of blackouts,  \n\u2022  minimal water consumption or usage,  \n\u2022  mitigation of hazardous on-site accidents, and \n\u2022 \n \nDiversification and Energy Security \n\nreductions in poverty or empowerment of vulnerable groups. \n\nA.  \n \nOne  benefit  to  clean  energy  is  diversification  away  from  conventional  fossil  fuels  or  incumbent \ninfrastructure systems. This diversification can encompass at least three dimensions (Sovacool 2010): \nSource diversification requires utilizing a mix of different energy sources, fuels, types, and fuel cycles \n(i.e., relying not just on nuclear power or natural gas but also coal, oil, wind, biomass, geothermal, etc.). \nSupplier  diversification  refers  to  developing  multiple  points  of  energy  production  so  that  no  single \ncompany or provider has control over the market (i.e., purchasing natural gas from not just one or two \ncompanies but a diversified mix of dozens of energy firms). Spatial diversification means spreading out \nthe locations of individual facilities so that they are not disrupted by single attack, event, malfunction, \nor  failure  (i.e.,  spreading  refineries  across  the  country  instead  of  placing  all  of  them  along  the  same \ncoast).  Typically,  an  \u201coptimized\u201d  level  of  diversification  is  achieved  when  all  three  dimensions  are \npromoted  at  once,  or  certain  portfolios  of  energy  systems  are  arranged  to  explicitly  minimize  risk \nacross the entire sector at the lowest cost. For instance, many renewable electricity systems can bring \nmultiple,  positive  cobenefits,  ranging  from  hedging  against  fossil  fuel  price  volatility  and  reduced \ngreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  to  improved  stakeholder  relations  and  the  revitalization  of  rural \nareas, as Table 3 indicates (Pater 2006). \n \n\nIndeed,  many  studies  have  suggested  that  a  diversified  energy  mix  encourages  technological \ncompetition between energy platforms, ensuring that progressive innovation takes place and that costs \nare minimized (Helm 2002). A diverse portfolio of technologies also helps attenuate load imbalances \ncaused  by  stochastic  power  flows  and  ensures  that  unexpected  increases  in  factor  prices  associated \nwith  any  given  technology  do  not  significantly  impact  the  economics  of  the  entire  energy  system \n(Valentine 2011). Portfolio diversification allows nations to weather unexpected disruptions to energy \n                                                 \n2   Quoted in Suzuki (2014).  \n\n \n\n\f8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nsupply  whether  it  is  caused  by  economic  shocks,  natural  disasters,  terrorism,  or  geopolitical \ndevelopments (Sovacool and Mukherjee 2011). A diversity of technologies allows different regions of a \nnation  to  exploit  any  geographic  or  technical  competencies  by  supporting  renewable  energy \ntechnologies  that  fit  the  community  context  (Awerbuch  2006).  Spreading  out  the  supply  of  energy \nacross a number of technological platforms minimizes the damage that can be caused by sole reliance \non one technology that for whatever reason suffers a competitive or technological setback (Li 2005). \nJapan\u2019s nuclear power program comes to mind in this regard. \n \n\nTable 3: Positive Cobenefits to Renewable Sources of Electricity \n\n \nRisk \nManagement \nHedge against \nfuel price volatility \n\nHedge against \nfuture \nenvironmental \nregulations \nHedge against \nfuture carbon tax \n\nMinimization of \nreliance on \nfutures markets \n\nReduced \ninsurance \npremiums \n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironmental \nPerformance \nEmissions credits \n\nInvestment \nProduction tax \ncredit \n\nReduced Resource \nUse \nReduced water use\n\nReduced emissions \nfees \n\nAccelerated \ndepreciation \n\nLower production \ncosts \n\nImproved \nPublic Image \nImproved \nrelations with \nstakeholders \nCorporate \nsocial \nresponsibility \n\nAvoided \nremediation and \npollution \nabatement costs \n\nLocal tax base \nimprovements \n\nReduced energy \nuse and wear and \ntear on \ntransmission and \ndistribution grid \n\n \n\n \n\nEconomic \nSpillover Benefits \nRural revitalization \n\nJobs and \nemployment \n\nEconomic \ndevelopment  \n\nAvoided \nenvironmental \ncosts of fuel \nextraction and \ntransport  \n \n\nJobs and Green Growth \n\nSource: Pater, J.

Nuclear  power  and  fossil-derived  electricity  are  the  most  capital  intense  and  create  net \nreductions  in  regional  employment  as  ratepayers  must  reduce  expenditures  on  other  goods  and \nservices  to  finance  construction.  Renewable  energy  technologies  such  as  wind  and  solar  as  well  as \ndistributed  sources  of  energy  such  as  efficiency,  however,  generate  3\u201310  times  as  many  jobs  per \nmegawatt  of  installed  capacity  as  fossil  fuel\u2014or  nuclear-based  generation  (UNEP  2000;  Kammen, \nKapadia,  and  Fripp  2004).  Renewable  power  sources  also  contribute  to  local  economic  growth  and, \naccording to some, provide better jobs. The manufacturing of renewable power technologies involves a \nhighly  skilled  workforce  and  a  modernizing  of  the  local  industry  base.  The  use  of  renewable  energy \nmakes local businesses less dependent on imports from other regions, frees up capital for investments \noutside  the  energy  sector,  and  serves  as  an  important  financial  hedge  against  future  energy  price \nspikes. In some regions of the United States, such as the Southeast, electric utilities expend $8.4 billion \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   9 \n\nper  year  importing  the  coal  and  uranium  needed  to  fuel  conventional  power  plants.  Investments  in \nthose  power  plants  send  money  out  of  the  economy  whereas  investments  in  renewable  power  keep \nmoney in the economy. About 50 cents for every dollar expended on conventional electricity leaves \nthe  local  economy  (and  in  some  areas  80%\u201395%  of  the  cost  of  energy  leaves  local  economies), \nwhereas every dollar invested in renewable electricity can produce $1.40 of gross economic gain.3   \n\n \nStudies of the employment effects of specific mitigation measures in Asian countries seem to \nvalidate  many  of  these  findings,  and  have  also  illustrated  a  substantial  scope  for  more  green  job \ncreation  across  not  only  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  but  also  agriculture  and  forestry \nactivities as well as green transport and public works. Overall, ADB and ADBI (2013) estimate that the \npotential gross green job creation in Asia is significant, on average at least of the order of 1% or 2% of \nthe  labor  force.  In  addition,  the  potential  for  green  jobs  tends  to  be  larger  in  poorer  Asian  countries \nbecause of the greater need to improve the environment and because of higher unemployment rates. \nFigure 2, for instance, depicts the green jobs potential across many major Asian economies.  \n\nFigure 2: Green Jobs Potential of Selected Asian \nEconomies \n \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nJapan\n\nIndia\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nPhilippines\n\nTaipei,China\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nGreen job postings\nGreen labor availability\n\nGreen market potential\nGreen job policies\n\n4\n\n \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute. 2013. \nLow-Carbon Green Growth in Asia: Policies and Practices.

The National Research Council reviewed 17 major energy efficiency programs funded by \nthe United States Department of Energy from 1978 to 2000, covering residential energy consumption \nefficiency  such  as  the  development  of  advanced  refrigerators  or  compact  fluorescent  lights, \ncommercial  improvements  such  as  electronic  ballasts,  and  industrial  improvements  such  as  oxygen-\nfueled glass furnaces and lost foam casting for steel making (Committee on Benefits of DOE R&D on \nEnergy Efficiency and Fossil Energy et al. 2001). They estimated that the total net realized economic \nsavings from these programs amounted to $30 billion (in 1999 dollars), while the programs cost only \n\n                                                 \n3   These figures come from two studies in California and Arizona, along with a survey conducted by Lovins and Lovins (1982, \n306). See Stoddard, Abiecunas, and O\u2019Connell (2006) and Arizona Department of Commerce Energy Office (2004). \n\n\f10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\n$7  billion  in  total  to  fund.  Another  assessment  of  the  Warm  Front  scheme  in  the  United  Kingdom, \nwhich  provided  energy  audits  and  grants  for  low-income  housing  investments  in  energy  efficiency, \nconcluded  that  over  its  lifetime  the  scheme  cost  \u00a32.4  billion  but  will  yield  \u00a387.2  billion  in  savings \n(Sovacool 2013). \n \nThere  is  also  substantial  evidence  that  energy  efficiency  is  the  best  way  to  mitigate  GHG \nemissions while also meeting the growing requirements for energy services that accompany expanding \neconomic  growth  (Brown  and  Sovacool  2011).  A  comprehensive  report  from  the  independent \nconsulting  firm  McKinsey  &  Company  (2010)  concluded  that  a  host  of  residential  and  industrial \nenergy efficiency options were far more cost effective than building power plants, even those running \non natural gas or renewable fuels. For the United States, McKinsey (2009, 12) calculated that: \n\n \nA holistic approach would yield gross energy savings worth more than $1.2 trillion, well \nabove  the  $520  billion  needed  through  2020  for  upfront  investment  in  efficiency \nmeasures (not including program costs). Such a program is estimated to reduce end-\nuse  energy  consumption  in  2020  by  9.1  quadrillion  BTUs,  roughly  23  percent  of \nprojected demand, potentially abating up to 1.1 gigatons of greenhouse gases annually. \n \nSimilarly,  one  peer-reviewed  evaluation  of  the  Energy  Star  program  in  the  United  States \ndetermined that from 1992 to 2006, it saved 4.8 exajoules of primary energy, circumvented 82 million \ntons  of  carbon-equivalent  emissions,  and  would  subsequently  prevent  a  further  203  million  tons  of \nemissions  from  2007  to  2015  (Sanchez  et  al.  2008).  A  separate  study  examined  the  cumulative \nprimary  energy  savings  from  the  Energy  Star  program  and  determined  that  it  would  save  $70  billion \nworth  of  cumulative  energy  over  that  decade,  even  though  managing  the  program  cost  only  a  small \nfraction of that amount (Brown, Webber, and Koomey 2002). \n\n \nAdvocates  further  argue  that  investments  in  efficiency  tend  to  generate  opportunities  in \nindustries  such  as  construction  that  are  more  labor  intensive  than  average,  meaning  they  produce \nmore net jobs per dollar invested (ACEEE 2011). One study conducted by the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy, a pro-efficiency think tank, calculated that investments in efficiency from \n1992 to 2010 would generate 1.1 million net jobs compared to business as usual (Geller, DeCicco, and \nLaitner 1992). The International Energy Agency found that consumers and businesses \u201crespend\u201d their \nenergy bill savings from efficiency improvements in areas of the economy that are more labor intensive \nand  productive  than  energy  purchases.  They  calculated  that  reducing  energy  consumption  by  15% \nduring  1995\u20132010  resulted  in  770,000  additional  jobs,  equivalent  to  a  0.44%  increase  in  overall \nemployment  rate,  and  $14  billion  in  additional  wages  and  salary  incomes  per  year  (Geller  and  Attali \n2005).  California\u2019s  comparative  advantage  in  energy  efficiency,  for  instance,  generated  about  $56 \nbillion  in  net  economic  benefits  since  1972,  yielding  an  employment  dividend  of  1.5  million  jobs \n(Cavanagh 2009).  \n\n \nDisplaced Pollution and Cost Savings from Improved Public Health \n\nC.  \n \nA  third  major  cobenefit  to  clean  and  green  energy\u2014especially  cookstoves,  renewables,  and \nefficiency\u2014is improved public health and corresponding cost savings. The most salient example here \nrelates to cooking. Burning firewood, dung, charcoal, and other fuels has severe health consequences. \nAs the World Health Organization (WHO 2006, 8) explains:  \n \n\nThe inefficient burning of solid fuels on an open fire or traditional stove indoors creates \na  dangerous  cocktail  of  not  only  hundreds  of  pollutants,  primarily  carbon  monoxide \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   11 \n\nand  small  particles,  but  also  nitrogen  oxides,  benzene,  butadiene,  formaldehyde, \npolyaromatic hydrocarbons and many other health-damaging chemicals. \n \nThere  is  both  a  damaging  spatial  and  temporal  dimension  to  such  pollution.  Spatially,  it  is \nconcentrated  in  small  rooms  and  kitchens  rather  than  outdoors,  meaning  that  many  homes  have \nexposure levels to harmful pollutants  60 times the rate acceptable outdoors in city centers in North \nAmerica and Europe (WHO 2006,  8). Temporally, this pollution from  stoves is  released at precisely \nthe same times when people are present cooking, eating, or sleeping, with women typically spending 3\u2013\n7 hours a day in the kitchen (Masud, Sharan, and Lohani 2007).  \n \n\nEven when these homes have a chimney and a cleaner burning stove (and most do not), such \ncombustion  can  result  in  acute  respiratory  infections,  tuberculosis,  chronic  respiratory  diseases,  lung \ncancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, low birth weights, diseases of the eye, and adverse pregnancy \noutcomes; as well as outdoor pollution in dense urban slums that can make air unbreathable and water \nundrinkable  (Jin  2006).  Table  4  shows  the  most  common  and  well-established  health  impacts  of \nindoor air pollution.  \n\n \n\nHealth Outcome \nAcute infections of the \nlower respiratory tract \nChronic obstructive \npulmonary disease \nLung cancer \n\nAsthma \n\nCataracts  \nTuberculosis \n\nEvidence\nStrong \n\nStrong \nModerate\nStrong \nModerate\nSpecified \nSpecified \nSpecified \nSpecified \n\nTable 4: Health Impacts of Cookstove Pollution \n \n\nPopulation\n\nChildren aged 0\u20134 years\n\nRelative Risk\n2.3 \n\nWomen aged more than 30 years\nMen aged more than 30 years\nWomen aged more than 30 years\nMen aged more than 30 years\nChildren aged 5\u201314 years\nAdults aged more than 15 years\nAdults aged more than 15 years\nAdults aged more than 15 years\n\n3.2 \n1.8 \n1.9 \n1.5 \n1.6 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.5 \n\nNote: \u201cStrong\u201d evidence means many studies of solid fuel use in developing countries supported with data from studies of active \nand passive smoking, urban air pollution, and biochemical and laboratory studies. \u201cModerate\u201d evidence means at least three \nstudies of solid fuel use supported by evidence from studies on active smoking and on animals. \u201cSpecified\u201d means strong \nevidence for specific age or groups. \u201cRelative risk\u201d indicates how many times more likely the disease is to occur in people exposed \nto indoor air pollution than in unexposed people. \nSource: World Health Organization. 2006.

This  places  it  well \nahead  of  physical  inactivity  and  obesity,  drug  use,  and  unsafe  sex.  In  March  2014,  WHO  (2014) \nprojected that 4.3 million people die annually from household air pollution due to the use of biomass \nand coal as cooking fuels. Smith et al. (2014a) project that cookstove smoke is responsible for 4.8% of \nlost healthy life years, making it \u201cthe highest\u201d among environmental risk factors. Figure 3, based on data \nfrom Subramanian (2014), breaks down these specific figures by type of disease and region.  \n\n \nThis means that cleaner forms of cooking have immense health benefits and massive value in \navoided  health-care  costs.  Indeed,  the  cost  of  the  burden  to  national  health-care  systems  from \ncooking,  not  reflected in the price of fuelwood or  energy, is  $212 billion to  $1.1 trillion (UNEP 2000; \nfigures  have  been  updated  to  2010  dollars).  WHO  (2014)  also  estimates  that  if  half  of  the  global \nhouseholds that still use traditional fuels and stoves switched to cleaner cooking  sources, over a 10-\n\n \n\n\f12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nyear period, families would save $34 billion per year and generate an economic return of $105 billion \nper year. \n \n\nFigure 3: Causes of Death from Household Indoor Air \nPollution, 2012 \n \n\n6%\nLung cancer\n\n22%\nChronic\nobstructive\npulmonary\ndisease\n\n26%\nIschaemic\nheart disease\n\nTotal deaths\nfrom HAP\n4.3 million\n\n12%\nAcute lower\nrespiratory\ninfections\n\n34%\nStroke\n\nTotal deaths attributable to HAP in 2012, by region\n\nAfrica\n\n581,300\n\nThe Americas\n\n81,300\n\nEastern\nMediterranean\n\n200,800\n\nEurope\n\n117,200\n\nSoutheast\nAsia\nWestern\nPaci\ufb01c\n\n1,691,600\n\n1,620,100\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1.4\nNumber of deaths (millions)\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n \n\n \nHAP = hazardous air pollutants. \nSource:  Subramanian,  Meera.  2014.

As  the  National \nAcademy  of  Sciences  has  noted  (America's  Energy  Future  Energy  Efficiency  Technologies \nSubcommittee et al. 2010, ix\u2013x):  \n\n \nEnergy  efficiency  requires  none  of  the  environmental  disruption  seen  in  extracting \ncoal, petroleum, natural gas, or uranium; depends on no wind turbines or hydroelectric \ndams or thermal power plants; emits no greenhouse gases or other pollutants; and can \nmitigate energy security risks associated with imported oil. \n\n \n\ndebate on global climate change. \n\nIts ability to reduce GHG emissions has propelled  efficiency into a leadership position in the \n\n \nFinally,  there  are  health  benefits  to  renewable  electricity  and  low-carbon  transport.

One study from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) analyzed the \ncobenefits  of  pursuing  a  global  mitigation  strategy  to  keep  temperatures  at  2\u00b0C  by  enacting  policy \ninitiatives in the PRC, the European Union, India, and the United States (Rajaf et al. 2013). The IIASA \nteam found that under a strong deployment of clean and green energy (an aggressive GHG emission \nmitigation  strategy),  expenditures  on  air  pollution  control  would  fall  by  \u20ac250 billion  in  2050. \nMoreover,  the  study  highlighted  significant \nlife \nexpectancy as a result of these policy initiatives. In the PRC alone, a mitigation strategy was projected \nto reduce concentrations of particulate matter by 50% and improve average national life expectancy \nby  20  months.  Decreases  in  ozone  concentrations  would  also  prevent  nearly  20,000  cases  of \npremature death. The study concluded by identifying a number of other indirect benefits arising from \nGHG emission reduction policies such as reduced acidification of forests, improved water quality, and \nenhanced watershed health. The International Monetary Fund similarly estimated in 2015 the cost of \nair pollution and associated health and economic damage that can be used to illustrate \u201cavoided costs\u201d \nwhen  fossil  fuels  are  replaced  by  clean  energy.  The  amount  monetized  was  staggering  (Coady  et  al. \n2015):  $5.3  trillion,  or  6.5%  of  global  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  with  the  largest  subsidies  in \nabsolute terms in the PRC ($2.3 trillion), the United States ($699 billion), and the Russian Federation \n($335 billion). \n \nEnhanced Resilience to Disasters and Climate Change Vulnerabilities \n\nD.  \n \nA  final  significant  cobenefit  to  clean  energy  is  minimizing  the  eventual,  severe  impacts  of  climate \nchange as well as improvements in  resilience and adaptive capacity to natural disasters. The primary \nclimatic  benefits  of  clean  energy  stem  from  the  fact  that  immediate  efforts  can  stop  the  buildup  of \nGHGs  in  our  atmosphere.  As  climate  scientist  James  Hansen  et  al.  (2008)  argue,  mitigation  is \nhumanity\u2019s  best  path  for  \u201cpreserving  a  planet  similar  to  that  on  which  civilization  depended  and  to \nwhich life on Earth is adapted\u201d (Hansen et al. 2008). Immediate GHG emission reductions are needed \nto keep concentrations of these gases to within a 500\u2013550 parts per million (ppm) range. As the IPCC \n(2014) implied in their latest global assessment, delaying invites disaster. \n\n \nAnother argument found in the literature is that clean energy and transport investments  can \nenhance adaptation and resilience, making it easier for physical or natural systems to cope with climate \nchange. Reducing the energy intensity of agriculture through better irrigation and less fertilization can \nalso create farming techniques that are more resilient to drought (The Economist 2010). More efficient \nspace  cooling  and  heating  can  reduce  electricity  consumption  while  also  making  cooling  more \naffordable  for  lower  income  groups  (Sovacool  and  Brown  2009).  Displacing  the  need  for  the \nexploration and drilling of offshore oil can prevent GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion while \ndiminishing the risk of oil spills and consequent stress on ecosystems (adaptation). Energy efficiency \nprograms  can  reduce  energy  use  and  cut  consumers\u2019  energy  bills,  translating  into  greater  financial \nresilience to future shocks (Moser and Boykoff 2013). \n\n \nSome investments, such as energy efficiency, can improve resilience in other ways. It has been \nestimated that, for instance, every dollar invested in energy efficiency mitigates uncertainty associated \nwith  reduced  load,  wear,  and  maintenance  needs  of  the  entire  fossil  fuel  chain,  even  in  hours  when \nreliability problems were not anticipated by system managers. This is because efficiency gains depress \nthe costs of locally used fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas, and reduced demand in peak hours, the \nmost expensive times to produce power. Efficiency gains also lessened costly pollutants and emissions \nimproved  the  reliability  of  existing  generators,  and  moderated  transmission \nfrom  generators, \n\n \n\n\f14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nTrade-Offs and Complexities \n\ncongestion problems. Furthermore, these initiatives, once put in place, were always at hand\u2014available \nwithout  delay  or  the  needed  intervention  by  system  operators  (Cowart  2001).  The  New  York \nIndependent  Systems  Operator,  for  example,  sets  a  reserve  criterion  of  18%  during  times  of  peak \ndemand to ensure overall system reliability. Accordingly, each megawatt-hour (MWh) of peak demand \nthat  customers  avoid  through  energy  efficiency  means  that  utilities  can  subtract  1.18  MWh  of  total \ncapacity needed. Quite literally, every single kilowatt-hour avoided through energy efficiency equates \nto 1.18 kWh of avoided supply (Komanoff 2002).  \n \nE.  \n \nThis is not to say that cleaner stoves, renewable sources of electricity, efficiency and clean transport \nare  without  challenges  or  trade-offs.  One  study  investigated  five  distinct  strategic  approaches \ndesigned to lessen a country\u2019s dependence on imported fuels, provide energy services at the cheapest \nprice possible, enable universal access to electricity grids, mitigate GHG emissions, and foster energy \nsystems that can operate under conditions of water stress and scarcity (Sovacool and Saunders 2014). \nThe study concluded that each of the five strategies were, more often than not, in conflict with each \nother.  A  group  that  supports  climate  change  mitigation  might  support  a  ramped-up  presence  for \nnuclear power, whereas a group supporting water security might seek to phase out nuclear power. No \nsingle strategy optimized all energy security criteria. \n\n \nThus,  one  pertinent  aspect  of  progressive  energy  and  transport  policy  appears  to  be  that \nvarious  components  have  the  potential  to  trade  off  with  each  other.  Encouraging  demand-side \nmanagement  and  energy  efficiency  can  reduce  peak  congestion  on  electric  power  grids  but  would \ndirectly cut into the profitability of building natural gas peaking plants (Sovacool 2008). Energy taxes \ncan  promote  efficiency  and  minimize  waste,  but  also  disfavor  energy  producers,  especially  Western \nand Gulf producers of oil and gas and global suppliers of coal (Kalicki and Goldwyn 2005).  \n\n \nRapid changes in fuel efficiency and fuel economy requirements can lower dependence on oil \nbut \nimpose  costs  on  automobile  manufacturers  that  can  reduce  employment  and  hurt \ncompetitiveness.  Creating  a  more  efficient  network  of  roads  could  lower  congestion  and  improve \nautomobile  fuel  economy  in  Indonesia,  but  would  also  only  make  it  easier  to  extract  and  distribute \ncoal, accelerating coal depletion and coal-related GHG emissions. Shifting from one reliable electricity \nsource  (such  as  hydroelectricity)  to  wind  energy  (intermittent  and  distributed)  and  coal  (prone  to \nvolatile  prices  and  GHG  emission)  would  increase  diversification,  but  could  worsen  overall  system \ndependability.  Diversification  from  historically  cheap  sources  such  as  coal  and  hydro  to  more \nexpensive ones such as wind and solar can improve availability but conflict with affordability and can \nalso  exacerbate  dependence  on  foreign  technologies  that  local  planners  may  not  own  (Sovacool \n2010). \n\n \nThis  litany  of  trade-offs  is  emblematic  of  how  improving  some  aspects  of  energy  policy,  or \ncapturing  cobenefits,  can  inherently  conflict  with  other  meaningful  dimensions.  We  see  such  trade-\noffs in each of the four case studies explored in the next section.  \n\n \n \n\nIV.  \n\nEXEMPLARY CASE STUDIES FROM ASIA \n\n \nThis section of the paper focuses on how to capture cobenefits in practice, concentrating its analysis \non  four  case  studies  that  span  different  sectors  (cooking,  electricity,  efficiency,  and  transport), \ncountries (Indonesia, the PRC, Japan, and Singapore), and time frames. Despite this heterogeneity of \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   15 \n\nCookstoves in Indonesia, 2007\u20132012 \n\ncases, each follows the same structure. It begins by briefly summarizing a historical description of the \ncase  examined  before  moving  to  discuss  its  cobenefits  and  finally  challenges  and  trade-offs \nencountered.  \n \nA.  \n \nIndonesia ran a large rural energy household program focusing on the conversion from kerosene stoves \nto liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves (Budya and Arofat 2011). In 2007, planners initiated a massive \nenergy  program  to  convert  primary  household  cooking  fuels  from  kerosene  to  LPG  in  more  than \n40 million households in less than 5 years. When it ended in 2012, the program had been implemented \nin 23 provinces throughout Indonesia, with 43.9 million conversion packages provided to citizens as of \n2012.  Thirteen  provinces  were  designated  as  \u201cclosed  and  dry,\u201d  meaning  that  distribution  of  the  \ufb01rst \npackages  was  completed  and  all  subsidized  kerosene  was  withdrawn.  The  program  enabled  the \nnational  gas  company  Pertamina  to  withdraw  8.2  million  kiloliters  of  kerosene  in  2012  and  replace  it \nwith 3.2 million tons of LPG. This household \u201cmegaproject\u201d provided an improved household cooking \nfuel, with its associated bene\ufb01ts in user costs, cleanliness, convenience, and environment, and reduced \nthe government\u2019s huge subsidy for petroleum fuels. \n \n\nThe  two  most  direct  benefits  have  been  reduced  subsidies  for  kerosene  and  cost  savings  for \nhouseholds. In 2012, the Government of Indonesia reported that they were able to reduce the state\u2019s \ngross subsidy for kerosene by $6.9 billion due to the success of the LPG program (Bakar and Hashim \n2011).  Moreover,  several  surveys  of  LPG  consumers  have  confirmed  their  overall  satisfaction\u2014and \ncost savings\u2014under the program. A large majority of the recipients of conversion packages said that \nthey  can  cook  faster,  have  a  cleaner  kitchen,  and,  most  importantly,  reduce  their  expenditure  for \ncooking fuel by approximately 30% (Pertamina Indonesia and WLPGA 2013). \n\n \nPerhaps  the  most  significant  indirect  benefit  has  been  jobs  and  economic  development \nthrough the creation of new industrial facilities. Most notable among these include the construction of \n8 new LPG terminals, 53 LPG cylinder factories, 31 stove factories, 14 regulator producers, and 22 \ufb01lling \nstations. In 2009, program evaluations estimated that the program generated $1.7 billion of investment \nacross these types of facilities along with 28,000 new jobs (Budya and Arofat 2011). A second indirect \nbenefit  has  been  displaced  emissions\u2014with  government  audits  suggesting  that  the  program  has \nreduced kerosene consumption by 6 million kiloliters pear year, equivalent to 8.4 million tons of carbon \ndioxide saved annually.  \n\n \nAchieving  these  cobenefits,  of  course,  has  not  come  without  challenges.  Some  women  have \nexpressed a concern that the new stoves cook food too quickly; that is, they had grown accustomed to \nthe fuel amounts and timing associated with an older stove and became quickly frustrated when the \nnew stove \u201cruined\u201d their meals (Sovacool and Drupady 2012). Moreover, the new stoves may not meet \na family\u2019s entire cooking needs\u2014families may wish to boil, bake, and broil with other cooking devices\u2014\nand they still depend primarily on fuelwood in some locations, meaning they contribute to some of the \nburdens associated with its collection  and use (Masera, Saatkamp, and Kammen 2000). In addition, \nthe use of LGP, a fossil fuel, does conflict in a way with the stated goals of environmental sustainability \nand  social  well-being  (Smith  and  Dutta  2011).  Lastly,  by  focusing  only  on  cooking,  an  admittedly \nlaudable goal, the program did not enable other types of energy services such as electricity, productive \nand mechanical energy, or mobility needed to achieve modern lifestyles and levels of access (Sovacool \net al. 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nRenewable Electricity in the People\u2019s Republic of China, 1988\u20132015 \n\nB.  \n \nOur  second  case  study  deals  with  renewable  electricity  in  the  PRC.  The  PRC  arguably  began  to \npromote  renewable  electricity  seriously  as  early  as  1988,  when  the  central  government  first  gave  the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  responsibility  for  coordinating  official  positions  in \nthen-upcoming international climate talks. More recently, the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (FYP), adopted \nby  the  Government  of  the  PRC  in  March  2011,  has  brought  environmental  and  climate-oriented \nconcerns to  the forefront of national  policy. Its targets included decreasing carbon intensity (carbon \nemissions per unit GDP) by 17% by 2015, increasing share of nonfossil energy in total energy mix from \ncurrent  8.3%  to  11.4%  by  2015,  and  increasing  research  and  development  (R&D)  expenditures  on \ncleaner  forms  of  energy  supply  from  1.8%  GDP  to  2.2%  GDP  (Xinghua  News  Service  2011).4    New \nrenewable energy production has also been driven by international trends such as the global market for \ncarbon credits. As of 2010, roughly half of the certified emission reductions (CERs) in circulation under \nthe Kyoto Protocol were produced by projects in the PRC, with roughly a third of the PRC\u2019s CERs being \nproduced  by  wind  projects  (Fogarty  2011).  In  particular,  on  27  February  2012,  the  PRC\u2019s  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission announced a plan to develop a national quota regime intended \nto  encourage  renewable  energy  development  (China  Daily  2012).  This  system  will  define  a  required \nmix of renewable and conventional electricity sources to be applied on a region-by-region basis (Wang \n2012). \n\n \nSuch targets do seem to be catalyzing the growth and acceptance of low-carbon technologies. \nIn 2013, the PRC led the world in the largest amount of renewable energy capacity installed that year, \nand it ranked first in six different categories of renewable energy. It was home to approximately a fifth \nof the world\u2019s renewable power capacity, with an estimated 229,000 MW of hydropower capacity in \naddition  to  about  90,000  MW  of  other  renewables  (mostly  wind)  (REN21  2013;  reporting  data  for \n2012). Renewables, including hydro, met 27.5% of the country\u2019s electricity supply, a share almost twice \nthat  of  the  United  States.  In  the  PRC,  for  the  first  time  ever,  wind  power  generation  increased  more \nthan  generation  from  coal  and  surpassed  and  exceeded  the  output  of  nuclear  power  plants  (REN21 \n2013).  Behind  the  United  States  and  Brazil,  the  PRC  is  also  currently  the  third-largest  producer  of \nbiofuels in the world. Table 5 presents slightly more updated data that show the PRC leading the world \nin  annual  investments  in  hydropower,  solar  photovoltaic,  wind  power,  and  solar  water  heating,  in \naddition to leading the world for total renewable power installed including and excluding hydropower \nas well as total wind energy capacity (REN21 2015). \n\n \nTaken  collectively,  these  policies  and  trends  are  meaningfully  altering  the  trajectory  of  the \nPRC\u2019s  energy  sector.  Bloomberg  New  Energy  Finance  predicted  in  2013  that  the  PRC  will  add  an \nadditional  1,583  gigawatts  (GW)  of  new  electricity  capacity  to  its  grid  by  2030,  and  that  renewable \npower  will  represent  more  than  half  of  these  new additions,  meaning  that  renewable  energy  reaches \n\u201cthe same capacity level\u201d as coal in 2030. That report forecast that \u201ccoal-fired power generation will \ndecrease  from  67%  in  2012  to  44%  in  2030,  or  25  GW  annually,  while  renewable  generation  will \nincrease from 27% in 2012 to 44% in 2030, at 47 GW per year\u201d (Bayar 2013). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4   See also Finamore (2011).  \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   17 \n\nTable 5: Global Trends in Annual Renewable Electricity Investment and Capacity, 2014 \n \n\n(a)  Annual Investment (2014) \n \n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 \n\nPRC\n\nUnited States\n\nJapan \n\nHonduras \nIndonesia \nCanada \n\nUnited States \n\n\u2013\n\nUnited States \n\nBrazil \n\nGermany \n\nPRC \n\n \n\n \n\nInvestment in renewable power \nand fuels (not including hydro > \n50 MW) \nInvestment in renewable \npower and fuels per unit GDP \n\nBurundi\nKenya  \nPRC \n\nUnited States\n\nGeothermal power capacity \nHydropower capacity \nSolar photovoltaic (PV)  capacity PRC\n\nConcentrating solar thermal \npower (CSP) capacity \nWind power capacity \n\nSolar water heating capacity\n\nPRC\n\nPRC\n\nKenya \nTurkey \nBrazil \n\nJapan\n\nIndia\n\nGermany\n\nTurkey\n\nBiodiesel production \n\nFuel ethanol production \n\nUnited States\n\nUnited States\n\nBrazil\n\nBrazil\n\n(b) Total Installed Capacity \n\nRenewable power (incl. hydro) \nRenewable power (not incl. hydro) \nRenewable power capacity per \ncapita (among top 20, not including \nhydro) \n\n \n \n\nPRC\nPRC \nDenmark \n\nBiopower generation \nGeothermal power capacity\n\nUnited States \nUnited States\n\nGermany \nPhilippines\n\nHydropower capacity \n\nHydropower generation\nCSP \n\n4\n\n \n\nSolar PV capacity \n\nSolar PV capacity per capita\n\nWind power capacity \n\nPRC\n\nPRC\n\nSpain\n\nGermany\n\nGermany\n\nPRC\n\n2\n\nUnited States \nUnited States \nGermany \n\n3 \n\nBrazil  \nGermany \nSweden \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nPRC \nIndonesia \n\nUnited States \n\nCanada \n\nIndia \n\nJapan \n\nBelgium \n\nBrazil\n\nBrazil\n\nPRC\n\nItaly\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited States\n\nGermany \n\nWind power capacity per capita Denmark\n\nSweden\n\nGermany \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, MW = megawatt, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.  \nSource: Modified from REN21. 2015. Renewables Global Status Report. Paris; reporting data for 2014. \n\nThis rapid increase in renewable electricity adoption has faced some difficulties, however. One \nof  them  is  a  continued  reliance  on  fossil  fuels  as  well.  The  PRC  government  has  been  building  new, \ndirty power plants at a frantic pace to keep up with demand. In the electricity sector, more than three-\nquarters  of  all  coal-fired  power  plants  worldwide  were  built  in  the  PRC  in  2010,  enabling  coal  to \ncontribute  to  about  80%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity  generation.  The  PRC  coal  sector  employs \n7.8 million people and produces about 40% of the world\u2019s coal (WWF 2007). The resultant increase in \nGHG emissions from the coal plants added to the PRC grid in the last 5 years has already offset all of \nthe gains made by the Kyoto Protocol and collective voluntary efforts around the world over the same \nperiod (The Energy Collective 2012). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n1\n\n \n\n\f18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nAs  such,  for  the  first  half  of  2013  the  PRC  government  reported  that  ambient  airborne \nparticulate  concentrations  in  74  of  the  PRC\u2019s  largest  cities  are  three  times  the  level  considered  safe \nunder  WHO  guidelines  (Bloomberg  2013).  The  World  Bank  similarly  estimated  that  the  economic \nburden  of  premature  mortality  associated  with  air  pollution  amounted  to  at  least  $63  billion\u2013\n$272 billion  in  damages  or  as  much  as  3.3%\u20137.0%  of  national  GDP  (Deng  2006;  McMichael  2007). \nConsequently,  WHO  (2007)  estimates  that  275,600  people  die  annually  because  of  outdoor  air \npollution in the PRC. About 30% of river water is so polluted that it is considered unfit for agricultural, \nindustrial,  and  electrical  purposes  (Carmody  et  al.  2010).  Two-thirds  of  the  PRC\u2019s  660  largest  cities \nsuffer  from  water  shortages  with  110  facing  \u201csevere\u201d  shortages,  and  water  pollution  throughout  the \ncountry sickens at least 190 million people and causes 60,000 premature deaths every year (Economy \n2007). \n\n \nEnergy Efficiency in Japan, 1999\u20132012 \n\nC.  \n \nJapan\u2019s  Top  Runner  Program  shows  how  adept  and  nimble  government  interventions  can  be  at \npromoting the widespread use of best practices in energy efficiency (across industrial manufacturing \nand  household  use)  by  closely  monitoring  technological  advances  (Komiyama  and  Marnay  2008; \nSiderius and Nakagami 2012).5 Japan established the Top Runner Program in 1999 as a means of tying \nenergy  efficiency  standards,  by  category,  to  19  different  products,  ranging  from  automobiles  and \nrefrigerators to computers and DVD players, shown in Figure 4. Then, within a time period mandated \nby the government, the average of the weighted sales of each manufacturer and distributor must meet \nthat new energy standard.  \n \n\nAs  Figure  4  also  indicates,  these  savings  reach  as  high  as  a  67.8%  improvement  for  air \nconditioners, 78% for fluorescent lights, and 99.1% for computers over time. The program\u2019s goals are \nalso strengthened by the Japanese concern for corporate image: \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d companies for \nfailing to meet standards is a highly effective tool used by the government. The program is expected to \ndeliver $3 billion in benefits in markets for lighting, vehicles, and appliances. \n\n \nPerhaps  the  biggest  single  challenge  facing  the  program,  however,  is  the  risk  of  a  \u201crebound \neffect\u201d where consumers increase consumption to accommodate more efficient (and often cheaper) \nenergy use. Energy efficiency efforts such as Top Runner can decrease the marginal price for an energy \nservice, increasing demand of that service as consumers reinvest the gains in additional consumption \n(Owen 2010). A variant of this thinking is known as the Jevons paradox, and it argues that efficiently \nusing energy causes the overall cost of using energy to decrease. This, in essence, liberates resources \nfor people to use, often in activities that consume more net energy (Alcott 2005). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n5   See also Kimura (2012).  \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   19 \n\nFigure 4: \u2018Top Runner\u2019 Energy Efficiency Standards and Achievements in Japan\n \n(a) Standards Applicable in 2012 \n \n\n1999\n\n2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 ...\n\n2015\n\nPassenger vehicles\n\n2010 Standards\nestablished\n\nFreight vehicles\n\n2010 Standards\n\nTo be enacted\nin 2010\n\n2015 Standards\n\n2015 Standards\n\nRoom air \nconditioners\n\n2004 Standards\n\n2010 Standards\n\nFluorescent lights\n\n2005 Standards\n\n2012 Standards (in review)\n\nTV sets\n\n2003 Standards\n\n2008 Standards\n\nCopying machines\n\n2006 Standards\n\n2012 Standards (in review)\n\n2011 Standards (in review)\n\n2005 Standards\n\n2007 Standards\n\n2003 Standards\n\n2008 Standards\n\n2004 Standards\n\n2010 Standards\n\n2006 Standards\n\n2008 Standards\n\nComputers and\nHard disk drives\n\nVideo cassette\nrecorders\n\nRefrigerators\nFreezers\n\nSpace heaters\n\nGas cooking\nappliances\n\nGas water heaters\n\nOil water heaters\n\nElectric toilet seats\n\nVending machines\n\nElectric\ntransformers\n\nMicrowave ovens\n\nElectic rice\ncookers\n\nDVD recorders\n\n \n\n \n\n2008 Standards\n\n2006 Standards\n\n2006 Standards\n\n2006 Standards\n\n2005 Standards\n\n2006 Standards\n\n2006 Standards\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n2012 Standards (in review)\n\n2012 Standards\n\n2008 Standards\n\n2008 Standards\n\n2008 Standards\n\n2010 Standards\n\n \n\ncontinued on next page \n\n\f20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nFigure 4   continued \n\n(b) Selected Efficiency Savings, Various Years\n \n\nProduct\n\nEstimated Improvement\nwith Top Runner Standards*\n\nRoom air conditioners\n\n66.1% increase in COP\n\n(FY 1997 vs 2004 freezing year)\n\nRefrigerators\n\n30.5% decrease in kWh/year\n\nTV receivers\n\n16.4% decrease in kWh/year\n\nComputers\n\n83.0% decrease in kWh/year\n\nFluorescent lights\n\n16.6% increase in lm/W\n\n(FY 1998 vs FY 2004)\n\n(FY 1997 vs FY 2003)\n\n(FY 1997 vs FY 2005)\n\n(FY 1997 vs FY 2005)\n\nVending machines\n\n33.9% decrease in kWh/year\n\n(FY 2000 vs FY 2005)\n\nResults\n\n67.8%\n\n55.2%\n\n25.7%\n\n99.1%\n\n78.0%\n\n37.3%\n\n22.8%\n\nGasoline passenger\nvehicles\n\n22.8% increase in km/L\n\n(FY 1995 vs FY 2010)\n\n(FY 1995 vs FY 2005)\n\n \n\n \nCOP = coefficient of performance, FY = fiscal year, km/L = kilometer per liter, kWh = kilowatt-hour, lm/W = lumens per watt.  \nNote: The starting and ending points of an arrow indicate the year of enactment for a particular standard.  \nSource: Modified from Kimura, Osamu. 2012.

The  indirect  effect  occurs  when  the  extra  income  is  used  to  consume  other  appliances \nmore, leading to increased energy consumption (Greening, Greene, and Difiglio 2000).

Deeply \nshaped  by  the  geography  of  Singapore  and  its  limited  resources  of  land,  the  project  resulted  in  a \nconcept  plan  in  1971  that  provided  the  framework  for  spatial  and  urban  development  oriented  to \ncreating a city center and road corridors (the plan has since been updated in 1991 and 2001) (Barter \n2008). The project highlighted that patterns of driving and vehicle ownership were rapidly becoming \nunsustainable  with  the  available  land  within  Singapore  and  brought  the  matter  of  transport  to  the \nattention of senior government officials (Barter 2008). Officials responded by implementing a number \nof mechanisms to restrict the supply of, and curb demand for, private vehicles. The most influential of \nthese mechanisms are presented in Table 7.  \n\nThese innovative mechanisms would not have been nearly as successful if they had not been \ncoupled to rigorous investments in  public transit. Efforts began in 1973 with improvements of buses, \nincluding  the  forced  mergers  of  bus  companies,  followed  by  the  imposition  of  a  professional  unified \nbus  company  in  1973,  the  reorganization  and  streamlining  of  bus  routes,  the  banning  of  pirate  or \nindependent taxis, and the creation of bus lanes in major corridors (Barter 2008; Santos et al. 2004). A \n$10  billion  mass  rapid  transit  (MRT)  rail  system  opened  in  1987  to  support  the  already  extensive \n12,600  buses  and  20,000  taxis  in  the  city  and  light  rapid  transit.  A  fully  automated  rail  system \nequivalent to the \u201cPeople Movers\u201d found in the United States was added in 1999.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\nTable 7: Major Measures Introduced to Curb Road Congestion in Singapore, 1972\u20132009 \n \n\nYear \n1972 \n\n1975 \n\n1987 \n\n1990 \n\n1994 \n\n1995 \n\nMeasure \n\nAdditional \nRegistration Fee \n(ARF) \nArea Licensing \nScheme (ALS) \n\nMass Rapid \nTransit  (MRT) \n\nVehicle Quota \nSystem (VQS) \n\nOff-Peak Car \n(OPC) Scheme \n\nRoad Pricing \nScheme (RPS) \n\nConcise Description of Measures/Systems\nExtra levy imposed on new vehicle, priced at \n5%\u2013140% of the vehicle\u2019s capacity and \nfunction.  \nRestrict access to central business district \n(CBD) from 7:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on \nSaturdays through purchase of supplementary \nlicenses.  \nServes heavy passenger transit corridors. \n\nCertificate of Entitlement (COE) is \nintroduced, i.e., new car population allowed to \ngrow at 3% in tandem with road capacity \ngrowth.

Sovacool. 2011. Climate Change and Global Energy Security: Technology and Policy Options. \nCambridge, MA: MIT Press. \n \n\nThe  collective  benefits  from  Singapore's  urban  transport  policies  can  be  divided  into  four \nareas. First, Singapore has lower private vehicle ownership than other European and North American \ncities of similar size, economic activity, and income. While the fleet of vehicles in aggregate has more \nthan  doubled  from  the  1970s  to  today,  its  expansion  has  barely  outpaced  population  growth,  with \nabout  100  cars  per  1,000  people  in  1970  and  only  130  cars  per  1,000  people  in  2008,  not  counting \nforeigners and expatriates. \n\n \nSecond,  Singapore's  efforts  have  improved  traffic  flow  and  reduced  congestion.  The  Area \nLicensing  Scheme  (ALS)  system  led  to  an  almost  immediate  reduction  in  traffic  by  50%  and  travel \nspeeds increased from an average of 17.7 kilometers per hour (km/h) to 33.8 km/h during the first year \nit operated. The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system has also reduced traffic volume into the central \nbusiness district by about 10%\u201315% during peak operation hours as compared to the ALS (Brown and \nSovacool  2011),  and  it  has  shifted  driving  habits  so  that  morning  peak  traffic  is  down  7.2%,  midday \ntraffic  down  7.6%,  and  off-peak  traffic  up  28%  (Brown  and  Sovacool  2011).  More  than  95%  of \nexpressways,  roads  in  the  central  business  district,  and  arterial  roads  were  \u201ccongestion  free\u201d  during \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   23 \n\npeak periods from 2006 to 2008.6 Congestion pricing and information schemes are estimated to have \nincreased traffic throughput at intersections and expressways with a net cost savings of $30 million per \nyear due to shorter delays and less time spent in traffic jams; less congestion also serves to lubricate \ncommerce  and  increase  productivity.  This  means  that  the  entire  Singaporean  transport  network  is \nmore efficient, with motorized passenger travel in Singapore consuming about 12,000 megajoules per \ncapita (MJ/cap) compared to 30,000 MJ/cap for a typical Australian city (Barter 2008). \n\n \nThird, taxes, fees, and programs such as the Vehicle Quota System (VQS) and ERP provide the \ngovernment  with  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  of  revenue.  Fixed  vehicle  taxes,  purchase  and \nownership fees, and the Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) account for about a fifth of all government \nrevenue,  creating  funds  that  are  then  invested  back  into  transportation  infrastructure  along  with \nhousing,  education,  health  care,  and  other  socially  desirable  programs.  While  the  implementation  of \nthe ERP system cost about $1.4 billion, annual revenue from the program was initially $350 million and \noperating  costs  only  $7 million,  meaning  the  system  paid  for  itself  in  5  years  (Brown  and  Sovacool \n2011). Currently, the ERP costs $20  million\u2013$25  million to operate but produces annual revenues of \n$100 million.  \n \nFourth, many components of the transport system are cheaper than other major metropolitan \nareas.  The  average  price  of  an  MRT  ride  in  Singapore  is  $0.91  compared  to  $1.15  for  New  York  and \nTokyo; $1.40 for Hong Kong, China; and $2.45 for London; the average price of a bus ride is $0.67 for \nSingapore but $0.87 for New York; $0.96 for London; $1.11 for Hong Kong, China; and $1.38 for Tokyo. \nMostly because of improved traffic flow, the average peak taxi fare for a 9-kilometer drive in Singapore \nis $9.39 compared to $12.35 in Hong Kong, China; $14.62 for New York; and $24.56 for London (Land \nTransport Authority 2008). \n\n \nNonetheless, Singapore continues to face a host of transport-related challenges. First comes \nincreasing  demand  for  travel  and  aspirations  for  the  ownership  of  private  automobiles.  The \nSingaporean  Land  Transport  Authority  expects  private  travel  demand  to  increase  from  8.9  million \njourneys a day in 2008 to about 14.3 million journeys a day by 2020 (Land Transport Authority 2008). \nOver the period between 1997 and 2004, however, the share of public transport during morning peak \nhours dropped from 67% to 63%. Less than 15% of people commuted to work by car in 1980, but about \na quarter did in 2000 (Brown and Sovacool 2011), and the total vehicle population grew from 670,000 \nin  1996  to  850,000  in  2007  (Land  Transport  Authority  2008).  The  number  of  vehicular  trips  has \ngrown by more than a factor of three, from 2.7 million trips in 1981 to 7.8 million trips in 2005 (Brown \nand Sovacool 2011). At the same time, Singapore is running out of space for cars, with 12% of its land \narea already occupied by roads and little physical space for growth. Even the VQS, which now restricts \ncar ownership to a growth rate of 1.5% per year, still permits ownership to grow substantially over time.  \n\n \nWith  rising  levels  of  affluence  and  changing  demographics,  the  expectations  for  many \nSingaporeans  have  been  realigned  to  value  the  increased  mobility  and  luxury  offered  by  private \nautomobiles. In absolute terms, the number of vehicles (and associated GHG emissions with operating \nthem)  continues  to  increase.  The  falling  cost  of  cars  due  to  increased  competition  from  overseas \nsuppliers and the availability of cheaper models only adds to this challenge, with a new Toyota Corolla \ncosting about $66,000 (inclusive of all taxes and fees) in the 1990s but only $40,000 today, and even \nless expensive automobiles from the PRC and the Republic of Korea running for less than $30,000, all \n\n                                                 \n6   \u201cPercentage  congestion  free\u201d  is  defined  as  the  percentage  of  expressways  with  average  speed  above  45  km/h  or \n\npercentage of CBD and/or arterial roads with average speed above 20 km/h. \n\n \n\n\f24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n\ninclusive. These falling costs may motivate people to purchase the maximum number of cars permitted \nunder the VQS. \n \nFurthermore, many of Singapore\u2019s policies have been technology and/or capital intensive. The \nERP,  for  example,  employs  a  combination  of  complex  radio  frequencies,  imaging,  and  smart  card \ntechnologies,  optical  detection,  cameras,  and  computers  working  simultaneously.  The  system \nnecessitated  10  years  of  planning,  testing,  and  preparation  including  a  pilot  program  that  involved \nfitting 250 vehicles with vehicle transponders and 4.8 million transactions (Brown and Sovacool 2011). \nBefore the ERP began operation, the government managed a free program to outfit 97% of all vehicles \nin  Singapore  with  transponders.  Foreign  cars  visiting  Singapore  must  pay  to  rent  a  battery-powered \ndevice so they can travel on ERP roads. Each of  these policies required substantial amounts of time, \nhuman resources, and money to implement. \n\n \nLastly,  the  urban  transport  policies  in  Singapore,  while  they  have  helped  curb  traffic  and \ncongestion,  have  still  heavily  favored  motorized  forms  of  transport.  That  is,  they  have  given  a  high \npriority  to  maintaining  traffic  flow  for  automobiles,  buses,  and  taxis,  and  incentivizing  commuters  to \nuse the MRT. This trend may be counterintuitive to attempts to improve the safety of nonmotorized \nforms  of  transport  (such  as  walking,  jogging,  running,  skating,  or  bicycling),  and  eliminating  the \ncongestion  of  private  automobiles  also  removes  the  speed  advantages  for  mass  transit  (Brown  and \nSovacool  2011).  Plans  for  the  future  also  reflect  this  bias,  with  much  discussion  of  community  car-\nowning schemes, an expansion of the off-peak program, and a transition to electric vehicles, but less \neffort to encourage walking and biking. \n\n \n \n\nV.  \n\nCONCLUSIONS AND POLICY INSIGHTS \n\n \nAt least four distinct conclusions and  policy  implications can be derived from the data in this paper. \nFirst,  low-carbon  forms  of  energy  supply  and  infrastructure  have  immense  positive  and  admittedly \ndifficult-to-monetize cobenefits. Cleaner forms of cooking have immense health benefits and massive \nvalue  in  reduced  morbidity  and  mortality  and  corresponding  avoided  health-care  costs  that  could \nreach into the trillions of dollars each year. Renewable sources of electricity not only provide electrons \nand  kilowatt-hours,  they  do  so  in  ways  that  generate  more  jobs  per  unit  of  energy  delivered  and \nenhance  diversification  and  energy  security.  Investments  in  energy  efficiency  have  been  shown  to \nenhance  innovation  and  economic  competitiveness,  generate  economic  returns,  improve  resilience, \nand  displace  GHG  emissions  and  other  forms  of  pollution  at  the  same  time.  Low-carbon  urban \ntransport infrastructure has been demonstrated to reduce traffic congestion, minimize GHG emissions \nand  pollution,  and  create  an  affordable,  popular  platform  for  transit  simultaneously.  These  benefits, \nmoreover,  are  proportional  to  the  amount  invested  in  a  particular  policy  or  the  volumes  and  scale \neconomies achieved by particular forms of technological diffusion. Simply put, the more invested, the \nexponentially greater degree of cobenefits gained.  \n \n\nSecond,  achieving  these  benefits  required  strong  government  commitment  in  each  case,  as \nwell  as  a  progression  of  policy  instruments  implemented  consistently  over  time.  Indonesia\u2019s  LGP \nproject  was  steered  at  the  executive  level  by  the  country\u2019s  Vice-President  and  worked  only  by \nstimulating  cookstove  adoption  while  also  disincentivizing  the  use  of  kerosene  through  the  repeal  of \nsubsidies. The PRC\u2019s promotion of renewable electricity has depended on strong state support in the \nform of binding national targets, adherence to the Kyoto Protocol and the global carbon credit market, \nand (most recently) discussions of emissions trading. Energy efficiency in Japan depended on state-led \ntargets  enforced  through  strict  financial  penalties  as  well  as  publicly  \u201cshaming\u201d  poor  industrial \n\n\fCobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   25 \n\nperformers. Singapore has pursued a synergetic approach to urban transport policy that involves both \n\u201csupply-side\u201d  and  \u201cdemand-side\u201d  elements  as  well  as  \u201ccarrots\u201d  and  \u201csticks\u201d  (Brown  and  Sovacool \n2011).  Aspects  have  included  restraint  of  vehicle  ownership  and  vehicle  moratoriums,  steady \nimprovement of public mass transit, road pricing schemes, and the provision of real-time information \nto  drivers.  \u201cSupply-side\u201d  components  have  invested  in  train  and  bus  infrastructure  and  constructed \nelectronic  road  pricing  schemes,  whereas  \u201cdemand-side\u201d  components  attempt  to  alter  behavior  in \nfavor  of public mass transit by restricting the  number of private vehicles through quota systems and \nhigher  vehicle  fees.  Stable,  consistent,  and  strong  government  support  is  a  common  theme  in  all  of \nthese cases; governments did not let markets or other actors lead. Put another way, markets will not \ncapture cobenefits on their own; the examples from Indonesia, the PRC, Japan, and Singapore are not \nnecessarily \u201ccost-effective\u201d in markets where fossil fuels are free and/or no price for externalities such \nas carbon exists. Correcting market and policy failures is not always costly in economic terms (use of \nresources and other inputs), but reform initiatives must confront a serious array of challenges including \npolitical difficulties, distributional consequences, social barriers, and analytical difficulties. \n\n \nThird, and drawing from this point about difficulty, more research is needed and considerable \ngaps exist. More specific recommendations on how to deal with the trade-offs in each country\u2014and \nothers  not  listed\u2014would  be  useful,  as  would  creating  a  typology  of  possible  policy  pathways  for \nidentifying  and  maximizing  cobenefits.  Efforts,  for  instance,  could  center  on  a  mix  of  technology \nprogress  (e.g.,  sharp  decline  in  solar  and  wind  power  costs),  removing  subsidies  on  fossil  fuels, \ndeveloping local manufacturing capacity for clean solutions, and good business models. Shorter-term \nor easier to achieve research objectives could include: \n\n \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nranking projects by cobenefit returns, \ncreating more credible fiscal frameworks, \nhighlighting the benefits of opportunistic investment in green and clean projects (the \nwinners and the positive distributional aspects), and \nmanaging fiscal policy in a timely fashion. \n\nLonger-term or more difficult to achieve objectives could include: \n\nconcentrating on correcting market and policy failures that could impede the growth of \nrapidly expanding green and energy sectors; \nconsidering past path dependence, need for scale, and the role of domestic \nendowments; \npricing energy and reforming subsidies; and \nmanufacturing credible policies that are \u201clong, loud, and legal.\u201d \n\nIn addition, a well-designed business engagement process could improve upscaling efforts. \n\nFigure 5 offers a sketch of how such a platform may look.

To be sure, each \ncountry  is  unique  and  each  program  had  to  confront  challenges.  Indonesia  saw  user  resistance  to \ncleaner and faster cooking devices by some households; the PRC\u2019s scramble for energy has forced it to \npush  for  both  renewable  and  fossil-fueled  electricity  at  the  same  time;  Japan\u2019s  energy  efficiency \nsavings may be offset by partial rebound effects; and Singapore continues to see the rise of private cars \ndespite  strong  disincentives.  Nevertheless,  these  cases  also  serve  as  empirical  success\u2014living \nlaboratories, so to speak\u2014where aggressive clean energy and climate policies have overcome the usual \nobstacles to successfully meet targets and reach impressive milestones. They deserve credit for serving \nas innovation policy laboratories that many other communities could learn from. \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAlcott, Blake. 2005. \u201cJevons\u2019 Paradox.\u201d Ecological Economics 54 (1): 9\u201321. \n \nAmerican Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). 2011.

It first defines what \nis meant by \u201cclean\u201d energy across the four technological systems of cooking, renewable electricity, energy \nefficiency, and urban transport. It summarizes at least four general types of cobenefits to investing in these \nsystems: (i) diversification and enhanced energy security, (ii) jobs and green growth, (iii) displaced pollution \nand associated cost savings, and (iv) enhanced resilience and adaptive capacity to things like climate change \nand natural disasters. The next part focuses on four case studies of where cobenefits have been delivered \nin practice: liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia, renewable electricity generation in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, energy efficiency in Japan, and mass transit in Singapore. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\nCOBENEfiTs AND TrADE-Offs \n\nOf GrEEN AND ClEAN ENErGy: \n\nEviDENCE frOm ThE ACADEmiC \n\nliTErATurE AND AsiAN CAsE \n\nsTuDiEs\n\nBenjamin K.
