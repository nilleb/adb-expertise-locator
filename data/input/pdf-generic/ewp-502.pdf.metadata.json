INTRODUCTION \n \nAsian countries have made remarkable efforts at increasing their electrification rate, yet energy access \noscillates noticeably. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) alone accounts for about 30% of the \nelectricity generated for the entire region, and six countries\u2014Australia, the PRC, India, Japan, the \nRepublic of Korea, and the Russian Federation\u2014account for 87% of generated electricity. When \nanalyzed as per capita figures, houses in New Zealand or Australia consume 100 times more electricity \nthan those in Bangladesh and Myanmar.  The region is also home to small island developing states like \nFiji and Vanuatu that are extremely difficult to supply with modern energy services. These countries, \nheavily  dependent  on  diesel  imports  with  exceptionally  small  electricity  grids  and  low  levels  of \naffordable access, are spread across about a third of the earth\u2019s surface but are home to less than a \nthousandth of the world\u2019s population. What sorts of energy technologies can provide access and \naddress these concerns? Moreover, what case studies of success exist for Asian countries to learn \nfrom? \n \nTo provide some answers, this working paper assesses the positive cobenefits of promoting \ngreen and clean energy in Asia. It first defines what is meant by \u201cclean\u201d energy across the four \ntechnological systems of cooking, renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and urban transport. Then, \ndrawn from a synthesis of peer-reviewed articles, it summarizes at least four cobenefits\u2014defined as \npositive, social, or economic spillovers that occur in addition to merely the provision of energy\u2014to \ninvesting in these types of systems. These include (i) diversification and enhanced energy security, (ii) \njobs  and  green  growth,  (iii)  displaced  pollution  and  associated  cost  savings,  and  (iv)  enhanced \nresilience and adaptive capacity to things like climate change and natural disasters. The paper also \noffers some insight into possible challenges and trade-offs that must be managed when attempting to \ncapture cobenefits. The paper then focuses on four case studies of cobenefits delivered in practice: \nliquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia, renewable electricity generation in the PRC, energy \nefficiency in Japan, and mass transit in Singapore.

", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   3 \nII.   CONCEPTUALIZING FOUR GREEN AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES \n \nThe paper begins by laying out its assumptions of what it considers \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cclean\u201d technologies, \nproviding definitions for clean or improved cookstoves, renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and \nlow-carbon urban transport.  \n \nA.   Clean and Improved Cookstoves \n \nThe potential for cleaner and improved forms of cooking is truly gargantuan, with roughly 2.7 billion \nnew customers for cooking fuels and technologies  entering  the marketplace (38% of the global \npopulation) (IEA 2015). Though the term \u201cimproved\u201d is subjective, modern stoves take a variety of \nforms. Sanchez (2010) argues that an \u201cimproved\u201d cooking source is one that requires less than 4- \nperson hours per week per household to collect fuel, has a conversion efficiency above 25%, and meets \nWorld Health Organization guidelines for air quality. Improved or clean stoves therefore frequently \nrequire a switch away from charcoal or polluted wood to \u201chealthier\u201d fuels such as soft biomass, crop \nresidues, and firewood; they have a grate and an improved combustion chamber; and they almost \nalways have a chimney. They utilize higher temperature ceramics, fire-resistant material, longer-lasting \nmetals, and possess more insulation and a better frame that guides hot gases closer to cooking pots. \nThey can cook more food at once and many have coils around the combustion chamber to heat water \nwhile cooking is in process. Some improved stoves are connected to radiators or space heaters so that \nheat could be recycled and/or vented to other rooms, and some stoves send heat through pipes \ndirectly into a brick platform that occupants sleep on at night (Brown and Sovacool 2011).  \n \nB.   Renewable Electricity \n \nRenewable electricity is dependent on nondepletable fuels that can be utilized through a variety of \nsources, approaches, systems, and technologies; in each case, renewing at a rate faster than they are \nconsumed.1  Plants and algae can capture sunlight for photosynthesis before they convert it to biofuels \nor biopower. Hydropower capitalizes on the rain and snowfall resulting from water evaporation and \ntranspiration. Wind generates electricity directly by turning a turbine or indirectly in the form of ocean \nwaves, but the wind itself is driven by the sun. Tides go up and down due to the gravitational attraction \nbetween the oceans and the moon. The heat trapped in the earth itself can be put to productive use \nthrough geothermal applications. \n \nOperators and analysts generally categorize electricity systems according to their fuel sources, \nas shown in Table 2: wind turbines (onshore and offshore); solar energy (including solar photovoltaic \npanels,  solar  thermal  systems,  and  concentrated  solar  power);  geothermal  (conventional  and \nadvanced); biomass (including landfill gas, agricultural waste, refuse, energy crops, as well as biofuels \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel); hydroelectricity (large and small); and ocean power. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1   While often characterized as relying on renewal through natural processes, some renewables in fact can rely upon or be \nenhanced by human assistance to natural processes. An example would be multi-species reforestation to offset a wood-\nfired electricity generating system.

The Dirty Energy Dilemma. Westport, CT: Praegar. \n \nC.   Energy Efficiency \n \nEnergy efficiency refers to the long-term reduction in electricity consumption as a result of the \nincreased deployment or improved performance of energy-efficient equipment (Brown, Southworth, \nand Stovall 2005). By reducing electricity consumption, energy efficiency is a low-cost contributor to \nsystem adequacy\u2014the ability of the electric system to supply the aggregate energy demand at all \ntimes\u2014because it reduces the baseload as well as the peak power demand. This reduction in peak \npower requirements can also contribute to system security\u2014the ability of the system to withstand \nsudden disturbances\u2014by reducing the load and stress at various points in the power distribution \nsystem, thereby decreasing the likelihood of failures. As one influential report on efficiency put it, \n\u201c\u2026 energy-efficiency  opportunities  are  typically  physical,  long-lasting  changes  to  buildings  and \nequipment that result in decreased energy use while maintaining constant levels of energy service\u201d \n(Rufo and Coito 2002, 1-1). \n ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   5 \nA close corollary of energy efficiency, demand side management, refers to programs that allow \nutilities to better match their demand with their generating capacity. By changing the load curve for \nutilities, system reliability can be enhanced and new power plant construction can be avoided or \ndelayed. Current programs tend to aim at limiting peak electricity loads, shifting peak loads to off-peak \nhours, or encouraging consumers to change demand in response to changes in the utilities\u2019 cost of \nproviding power (Gillingham, Newell, and Palmer 2004). \n \nAnother variant is demand response, which refers to curtailment or other immediate steps that \nare aimed at reducing the peak megawattage of load (Brown and Sovacool 2008). Real-time demand\u2013\nresponse programs allow consumers to respond to electricity prices directly, offering mechanisms to \nhelp manage the electricity load in times of peak electricity demand to improve market efficiency, \nincrease reliability, and relieve grid congestion. Significant consumer benefits also accrue from real-\ntime demand\u2013response programs, chiefly in the form of cost savings because of lower peak electricity \nprices,  less  opportunity  for  market  manipulation  by  electricity  providers,  and  additional  financial \nincentives to induce their participation in these programs (Goldman et al. 2005). \n \nD.   Low-Carbon Transit and Mobility  \n \nDue to its complexity, transport planners generally argue that \u201clow-carbon\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d involves \none of four tracks (Woodcock et al. 2007): One is improving the energy efficiency of transport modes \nand technologies, either through accelerated innovation or radical component substitution (e.g., hybrid \nelectric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, and biofuel for transport). Some of this can focus on existing \ntechnologies rather than entirely new or novel ones. Although most major automobile manufacturers \nhave released electric vehicles (EVs), they also market an array of increasingly fuel-efficient models \npropelled by blended fuels or hybrid technology. Given the difficulty of transforming infrastructure \nsystems, EV critics argue that similar carbon dioxide (CO ) reductions can be gained by improving \n2\nconventional internal combustion engine (ICE) technology and shifting to flex fuels. A number of \nemerging technologies are expected to significantly improve ICE vehicle efficiency over the next 2 \ndecades (Bandivadekar et al. 2008). In addition, reductions in vehicle weight, improved aerodynamics, \nand size decreases could improve fuel efficiency. It has been estimated that a 20% vehicle weight \nreduction in an average vehicle is possible over the next 25 years, producing a further 12%\u201320% \nreduction in fuel consumption. \n \nA second is reducing car use through a modal shift, especially to things like \u201cactive transport\u201d \nand bicycling. Active transport holds significant potential to both improve health and lower transport-\nenergy use. Advocates of a new transport paradigm suggest that far better transport strategies exist, \nones that promote human fitness and better transport efficiency, and include a mix of walking, cycling, \nand public buses and trains. Figure 1 quantifies the enhanced transport efficiencies and reduced \nemissions associated with various modes of transport including walking, cycling, electronic bikes, and \nlight rail.   \n \nAnother is reducing trip lengths through (nontransport) innovations such as compact cities \nand  smart  cities.  These  studies  suggest  that  urban  form  and  infrastructure  is  key  to  transport \nsustainability.  Higher-density  land  use  is  inherently  more  energy-efficient  because  distances  are \nshorter. Combined with developments in public transport, higher density enables a more frequent and \nhigher-occupancy public transport with lower emissions per passenger. Mixed-use developments, \nbetter housing location and building design, and support for local services that can reduce travel \ndistances to employment, education, health services, and shops are all part of this strategy (Woodcock \net al. 2007). \n ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \nFigure 1: Energy and Carbon Intensity of Transportation \nModes \n \n900\n10,000 800\n700\n8,000\n600\n6,000 500\n400\n4,000\n300\n200\n2,000\n100\n0 0\ne\nbik\ne-\nEfficiency (BTUs/passenger mile) Emissions (grams CO2e/passenger km)\n \nBTU = British thermal unit, COe = carbon dioxide equivalent, EV = electric vehicle, \n2\nkm = kilometer, US = United States. \nSource: Modified from Cleveland, Cutler J., and Christopher G.

Such studies tend to suggest that avoiding vehicle trips can be met through things \nlike information and communication technology (e.g., teleconferencing) that can replace physical \ntravel with electronic communication.  \n \n \nIII.   ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON COBENEFITS AND TRADE-OFFS \n \nThe four technologies\u2014cleaner cooking stoves, renewable electricity, efficiency, and transport\u2014not \nonly provide energy or mobility, but also have an array of \u201ccobenefits.\u201d  This refers to the positive side \neffects, secondary benefits, collateral benefits, or associated benefits from a particular green policy or \nclean energy system (Miyatsuka and Zusman 2010). Cobenefits can be direct or indirect, as well as \nmonetary or nonmonetary. A useful classification of cobenefits is provided by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB  and  ADBI  2013,  chapter  4),  which  notes  that  \u201cLevel  1\u201d  cobenefits  can  refer  to \ncircumstances where cobenefits are roughly proportional to the amount of investment, such as jobs or \nimprovements to health. \u201cLevel 2\u201d cobenefits are more abstract and need not always be tied to the \nscale of investment, but are required to reach a particular level, such as achieving energy security or \nindependence from particular imports. \u201cLevel 3\u201d cobenefits can refer to multiplier benefits that are \ninterlinked with many causal factors and are not easy to quantify, such as enhancements to national \ncompetitiveness or innovation.  \n ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   7 \nDespite these differing levels and types of cobenefits, the idea is that investments in clean and \ngreen energy produce benefits beyond the energy system and can include reductions in emissions, cost \nsavings, jobs, improvements to health, and a reduced risk of climate change (Reinhardt 1999). As \nPresident of the United States Barack Obama put it, \u201ca transition to clean energy is good for business\u201d \n(Lewis 2014). Similarly, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim argues that there is no trade-off \nwhen it comes to transitioning to clean technology: \u201cwe believe it\u2019s possible to reduce emissions and \ndeliver jobs and economic opportunity, while also cutting health care and energy costs.\u201d2 Although the \ncobenefits offered by clean energy systems are diverse and difficult to value and monetize, we briefly \nsurvey them across four categories: energy security, green growth, environmental pollution such as \nclimate  change  and  the  degradation  of  air  quality,  and  resilience.  Cobenefits  also  have  some \ncomplexities discussed in section III.E. To be sure, these cobenefits are not the only ones; others that \nmay deserve exploration in future research include:  \n \n\u2022  preservation of land use and wildlife, \n\u2022  fuel availability and/or stability and predictability of prices, \n\u2022  energy payback ratios or energy returns on investment \n\u2022  modularity and quicker construction times, \n\u2022  learning curves and rates of improvement, \n\u2022  enhanced reliability and the avoidance of blackouts,  \n\u2022  minimal water consumption or usage,  \n\u2022  mitigation of hazardous on-site accidents, and \n\u2022  reductions in poverty or empowerment of vulnerable groups. \n \nA.   Diversification and Energy Security \n \nOne  benefit  to  clean  energy  is  diversification  away  from  conventional  fossil  fuels  or  incumbent \ninfrastructure systems. This diversification can encompass at least three dimensions (Sovacool 2010): \nSource diversification requires utilizing a mix of different energy sources, fuels, types, and fuel cycles \n(i.e., relying not just on nuclear power or natural gas but also coal, oil, wind, biomass, geothermal, etc.). \nSupplier diversification refers to developing multiple points of energy production so that no single \ncompany or provider has control over the market (i.e., purchasing natural gas from not just one or two \ncompanies but a diversified mix of dozens of energy firms). Spatial diversification means spreading out \nthe locations of individual facilities so that they are not disrupted by single attack, event, malfunction, \nor failure (i.e., spreading refineries across the country instead of placing all of them along the same \ncoast). Typically, an \u201coptimized\u201d level of diversification is achieved when all three dimensions are \npromoted at once, or certain portfolios of energy systems are arranged to explicitly minimize risk \nacross the entire sector at the lowest cost. For instance, many renewable electricity systems can bring \nmultiple, positive cobenefits, ranging from hedging against fossil fuel price volatility and reduced \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to improved stakeholder relations and the revitalization of rural \nareas, as Table 3 indicates (Pater 2006). \n \nIndeed, many studies have suggested that a diversified energy mix encourages technological \ncompetition between energy platforms, ensuring that progressive innovation takes place and that costs \nare minimized (Helm 2002). A diverse portfolio of technologies also helps attenuate load imbalances \ncaused by stochastic power flows and ensures that unexpected increases in factor prices associated \nwith any given technology do not significantly impact the economics of the entire energy system \n(Valentine 2011). Portfolio diversification allows nations to weather unexpected disruptions to energy \n                                                 \n2   Quoted in Suzuki (2014).  \n ", "8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \nsupply  whether  it  is  caused  by  economic  shocks,  natural  disasters,  terrorism,  or  geopolitical \ndevelopments (Sovacool and Mukherjee 2011). A diversity of technologies allows different regions of a \nnation  to  exploit  any  geographic  or  technical  competencies  by  supporting  renewable  energy \ntechnologies that fit the community context (Awerbuch 2006). Spreading out the supply of energy \nacross a number of technological platforms minimizes the damage that can be caused by sole reliance \non one technology that for whatever reason suffers a competitive or technological setback (Li 2005). \nJapan\u2019s nuclear power program comes to mind in this regard. \n \nTable 3: Positive Cobenefits to Renewable Sources of Electricity \n \nRisk  Environmental  Reduced Resource  Improved  Economic \nManagement  Performance  Investment  Use  Public Image  Spillover Benefits \nHedge against  Emissions credits  Production tax  Reduced water use Improved  Rural revitalization \nfuel price volatility  credit  relations with \nstakeholders \nHedge against  Reduced emissions  Accelerated  Lower production  Corporate  Jobs and \nfuture  fees  depreciation  costs  social  employment \nenvironmental  responsibility \nregulations \nHedge against  Avoided  Local tax base  Reduced energy  Economic \nfuture carbon tax  remediation and  improvements  use and wear and  development  \npollution  tear on \nabatement costs  transmission and \ndistribution grid \nMinimization of      Avoided \nreliance on  environmental \nfutures markets  costs of fuel \nextraction and \ntransport  \nReduced       \ninsurance \npremiums \nSource: Pater, J.

Golden, CO: National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  \n \nB.   Jobs and Green Growth \n \nA second cobenefit is perhaps more straightforward and easier to measure\u2014jobs and green growth\u2014\nthough most of the literature focuses on countries in Europe or the United States.  \n \nThe more capital intensive an energy technology or infrastructure system is, the less embodied \nlabor it has. Nuclear power and fossil-derived electricity are the most capital intense and create net \nreductions in regional employment as ratepayers must reduce expenditures on other goods and \nservices to finance construction. Renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar as well as \ndistributed sources of energy such as efficiency, however, generate 3\u201310 times as many jobs per \nmegawatt of installed capacity as fossil fuel\u2014or nuclear-based generation (UNEP 2000; Kammen, \nKapadia, and Fripp 2004). Renewable power sources also contribute to local economic growth and, \naccording to some, provide better jobs. The manufacturing of renewable power technologies involves a \nhighly skilled workforce and a modernizing of the local industry base. The use of renewable energy \nmakes local businesses less dependent on imports from other regions, frees up capital for investments \noutside the energy sector, and serves as an important financial hedge against future energy price \nspikes. In some regions of the United States, such as the Southeast, electric utilities expend $8.4 billion ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   9 \nper year importing the coal and uranium needed to fuel conventional power plants. Investments in \nthose power plants send money out of the economy whereas investments in renewable power keep \nmoney in the economy. About 50 cents for every dollar expended on conventional electricity leaves \nthe local economy (and in some areas 80%\u201395% of the cost of energy leaves local economies), \nwhereas every dollar invested in renewable electricity can produce $1.40 of gross economic gain.3   \n \nStudies of the employment effects of specific mitigation measures in Asian countries seem to \nvalidate many of these findings, and have also illustrated a substantial scope for more green job \ncreation across not only renewable energy and energy efficiency but also agriculture and forestry \nactivities as well as green transport and public works. Overall, ADB and ADBI (2013) estimate that the \npotential gross green job creation in Asia is significant, on average at least of the order of 1% or 2% of \nthe labor force. In addition, the potential for green jobs tends to be larger in poorer Asian countries \nbecause of the greater need to improve the environment and because of higher unemployment rates. \nFigure 2, for instance, depicts the green jobs potential across many major Asian economies.  \n \nFigure 2: Green Jobs Potential of Selected Asian \nEconomies \n \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nJapan\nIndia\nRepublic of Korea\nSingapore\nHong Kong, China\nPhilippines\nTaipei,China\nMalaysia\nIndonesia\nThailand\nViet Nam\nSaudi Arabia\n0 1 2 3 4\nGreen job postings Green market potential\nGreen labor availability Green job policies  \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute. 2013. \nLow-Carbon Green Growth in Asia: Policies and Practices. Manila: ADB. \n \nSimilarly,  investments  in  energy  efficiency  have  been  shown  to  enhance  industrial \ncompetitiveness, generate economic returns, and displace emissions at the same time (Niederberger \net al. 2005). The National Research Council reviewed 17 major energy efficiency programs funded by \nthe United States Department of Energy from 1978 to 2000, covering residential energy consumption \nefficiency  such  as  the  development  of  advanced  refrigerators  or  compact  fluorescent  lights, \ncommercial improvements such as electronic ballasts, and industrial improvements such as oxygen-\nfueled glass furnaces and lost foam casting for steel making (Committee on Benefits of DOE R&D on \nEnergy Efficiency and Fossil Energy et al. 2001). They estimated that the total net realized economic \nsavings from these programs amounted to $30 billion (in 1999 dollars), while the programs cost only \n                                                 \n3   These figures come from two studies in California and Arizona, along with a survey conducted by Lovins and Lovins (1982, \n306). See Stoddard, Abiecunas, and O\u2019Connell (2006) and Arizona Department of Commerce Energy Office (2004). \n ", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \n$7 billion in total to fund. Another assessment of the Warm Front scheme in the United Kingdom, \nwhich provided energy audits and grants for low-income housing investments in energy efficiency, \nconcluded that over its lifetime the scheme cost \u00a32.4 billion but will yield \u00a387.2 billion in savings \n(Sovacool 2013). \n \nThere is also substantial evidence that energy efficiency is the best way to mitigate GHG \nemissions while also meeting the growing requirements for energy services that accompany expanding \neconomic  growth  (Brown  and  Sovacool  2011).  A  comprehensive  report  from  the  independent \nconsulting firm McKinsey & Company (2010) concluded that a host of residential and industrial \nenergy efficiency options were far more cost effective than building power plants, even those running \non natural gas or renewable fuels. For the United States, McKinsey (2009, 12) calculated that: \n \nA holistic approach would yield gross energy savings worth more than $1.2 trillion, well \nabove the $520 billion needed through 2020 for upfront investment in efficiency \nmeasures (not including program costs). Such a program is estimated to reduce end-\nuse energy  consumption in 2020 by 9.1 quadrillion BTUs, roughly 23 percent of \nprojected demand, potentially abating up to 1.1 gigatons of greenhouse gases annually. \n \nSimilarly, one peer-reviewed evaluation of the Energy Star program in the United States \ndetermined that from 1992 to 2006, it saved 4.8 exajoules of primary energy, circumvented 82 million \ntons of carbon-equivalent emissions, and would subsequently prevent a further 203 million tons of \nemissions from 2007 to 2015 (Sanchez et al. 2008). A separate study examined the cumulative \nprimary energy savings from the Energy Star program and determined that it would save $70 billion \nworth of cumulative energy over that decade, even though managing the program cost only a small \nfraction of that amount (Brown, Webber, and Koomey 2002). \n \nAdvocates further argue that investments in efficiency tend to generate opportunities in \nindustries such as construction that are more labor intensive than average, meaning they produce \nmore net jobs per dollar invested (ACEEE 2011). One study conducted by the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy, a pro-efficiency think tank, calculated that investments in efficiency from \n1992 to 2010 would generate 1.1 million net jobs compared to business as usual (Geller, DeCicco, and \nLaitner 1992). The International Energy Agency found that consumers and businesses \u201crespend\u201d their \nenergy bill savings from efficiency improvements in areas of the economy that are more labor intensive \nand productive than energy purchases. They calculated that reducing energy consumption by 15% \nduring 1995\u20132010 resulted in 770,000 additional jobs, equivalent to a 0.44% increase in overall \nemployment rate, and $14 billion in additional wages and salary incomes per year (Geller and Attali \n2005). California\u2019s comparative advantage in energy efficiency, for instance, generated about $56 \nbillion in net economic benefits since 1972, yielding an employment dividend of 1.5 million jobs \n(Cavanagh 2009).  \n \nC.   Displaced Pollution and Cost Savings from Improved Public Health \n \nA  third  major  cobenefit  to  clean  and  green  energy\u2014especially  cookstoves,  renewables,  and \nefficiency\u2014is improved public health and corresponding cost savings. The most salient example here \nrelates to cooking. Burning firewood, dung, charcoal, and other fuels has severe health consequences. \nAs the World Health Organization (WHO 2006, 8) explains:  \n \nThe inefficient burning of solid fuels on an open fire or traditional stove indoors creates \na dangerous cocktail of not only hundreds of pollutants, primarily carbon monoxide ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   11 \nand  small  particles,  but  also  nitrogen  oxides,  benzene,  butadiene,  formaldehyde, \npolyaromatic hydrocarbons and many other health-damaging chemicals. \n \nThere is both a damaging spatial and temporal dimension to such pollution. Spatially, it is \nconcentrated in small rooms and kitchens rather than outdoors, meaning that many homes have \nexposure levels to harmful pollutants 60 times the rate acceptable outdoors in city centers in North \nAmerica and Europe (WHO 2006, 8). Temporally, this pollution from stoves is released at precisely \nthe same times when people are present cooking, eating, or sleeping, with women typically spending 3\u2013\n7 hours a day in the kitchen (Masud, Sharan, and Lohani 2007).  \n \nEven when these homes have a chimney and a cleaner burning stove (and most do not), such \ncombustion can result in acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis, chronic respiratory diseases, lung \ncancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, low birth weights, diseases of the eye, and adverse pregnancy \noutcomes; as well as outdoor pollution in dense urban slums that can make air unbreathable and water \nundrinkable (Jin 2006). Table 4 shows the most common and well-established health impacts of \nindoor air pollution.  \n \nTable 4: Health Impacts of Cookstove Pollution \n \nHealth Outcome  Evidence Population Relative Risk\nAcute infections of the  Strong  Children aged 0\u20134 years 2.3 \nlower respiratory tract \nChronic obstructive  Strong  Women aged more than 30 years 3.2 \npulmonary disease  Moderate Men aged more than 30 years 1.8 \nLung cancer  Strong  Women aged more than 30 years 1.9 \nModerate Men aged more than 30 years 1.5 \nAsthma  Specified  Children aged 5\u201314 years 1.6 \nSpecified  Adults aged more than 15 years 1.2 \nCataracts   Specified  Adults aged more than 15 years 1.3 \nTuberculosis  Specified  Adults aged more than 15 years 1.5 \nNote: \u201cStrong\u201d evidence means many studies of solid fuel use in developing countries supported with data from studies of active \nand passive smoking, urban air pollution, and biochemical and laboratory studies. \u201cModerate\u201d evidence means at least three \nstudies of solid fuel use supported by evidence from studies on active smoking and on animals. \u201cSpecified\u201d means strong \nevidence for specific age or groups. \u201cRelative risk\u201d indicates how many times more likely the disease is to occur in people exposed \nto indoor air pollution than in unexposed people. \nSource: World Health Organization. 2006. Fuel for Life. Geneva.  \n \nStrikingly, in 2012, indoor air pollution was ranked fourth on the global burden of disease risk \nfactors at almost 5%, coming after only high blood pressure (almost 8%), tobacco smoking and \nsecond-hand smoke (about 7%), and alcohol use (about 6%) (Lim et al. 2012). This places it well \nahead of physical inactivity and obesity, drug use, and unsafe sex. In March 2014, WHO (2014) \nprojected that 4.3 million people die annually from household air pollution due to the use of biomass \nand coal as cooking fuels. Smith et al. (2014a) project that cookstove smoke is responsible for 4.8% of \nlost healthy life years, making it \u201cthe highest\u201d among environmental risk factors. Figure 3, based on data \nfrom Subramanian (2014), breaks down these specific figures by type of disease and region.  \n \nThis means that cleaner forms of cooking have immense health benefits and massive value in \navoided health-care costs. Indeed, the cost of the burden to national health-care systems from \ncooking, not reflected in the price of fuelwood or energy, is $212 billion to $1.1 trillion (UNEP 2000; \nfigures have been updated to 2010 dollars). WHO (2014) also estimates that if half of the global \nhouseholds that still use traditional fuels and stoves switched to cleaner cooking sources, over a 10-\n ", "12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \nyear period, families would save $34 billion per year and generate an economic return of $105 billion \nper year. \n \nFigure 3: Causes of Death from Household Indoor Air \nPollution, 2012 \n \n6%\nLung cancer 12%\nAcute lower\nrespiratory\ninfections\n22%\nChronic Total deaths\nobstructive from HAP\npulmonary 4.3 million\ndisease\n34%\nStroke\n26%\nIschaemic\nheart disease\nTotal deaths attributable to HAP in 2012, by region\nAfrica 581,300\nThe Americas 81,300\nEastern\n200,800\nMediterranean\nEurope 117,200\nSoutheast\n1,691,600\nAsia\nWestern\n1,620,100\nPaci\ufb01c\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\nNumber of deaths (millions)  \n \nHAP = hazardous air pollutants. \nSource: Subramanian, Meera. 2014. Global Health: Deadly Dinners. Nature 509 \n(7502): 548\u201351. \n \nEnergy efficiency practices can also greatly displace and minimize pollution. As the National \nAcademy  of  Sciences  has  noted  (America's  Energy  Future  Energy  Efficiency  Technologies \nSubcommittee et al. 2010, ix\u2013x):  \n \nEnergy efficiency requires none of the environmental disruption seen in extracting \ncoal, petroleum, natural gas, or uranium; depends on no wind turbines or hydroelectric \ndams or thermal power plants; emits no greenhouse gases or other pollutants; and can \nmitigate energy security risks associated with imported oil. \n \nIts ability to reduce GHG emissions has propelled efficiency into a leadership position in the \ndebate on global climate change. \n \nFinally,  there  are  health  benefits  to  renewable  electricity  and  low-carbon  transport.  The \nIntergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  argues  that  the  health  cobenefits  from  low-carbon \ninfrastructure include fewer deaths from heat waves and forest fires to better food security and ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   13 \nimproved curtailment of disease epidemics (Smith et al. 2014b). These can be roughly quantified into \n$40\u2013$198 of positive health value per metric ton of carbon dioxide mitigated by 2020 (Balbus et al. \n2014). One study from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) analyzed the \ncobenefits of pursuing a global mitigation strategy to keep temperatures at 2\u00b0C by enacting policy \ninitiatives in the PRC, the European Union, India, and the United States (Rajaf et al. 2013). The IIASA \nteam found that under a strong deployment of clean and green energy (an aggressive GHG emission \nmitigation  strategy),  expenditures  on  air  pollution  control  would  fall  by  \u20ac250 billion  in  2050. \nMoreover,  the  study  highlighted  significant  improvements  in  human  health  and  average  life \nexpectancy as a result of these policy initiatives. In the PRC alone, a mitigation strategy was projected \nto reduce concentrations of particulate matter by 50% and improve average national life expectancy \nby  20  months.  Decreases  in  ozone  concentrations  would  also  prevent  nearly  20,000  cases  of \npremature death. The study concluded by identifying a number of other indirect benefits arising from \nGHG emission reduction policies such as reduced acidification of forests, improved water quality, and \nenhanced watershed health. The International Monetary Fund similarly estimated in 2015 the cost of \nair pollution and associated health and economic damage that can be used to illustrate \u201cavoided costs\u201d \nwhen fossil fuels are replaced by clean energy. The amount monetized was staggering (Coady et al. \n2015): $5.3 trillion, or 6.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), with the largest subsidies in \nabsolute terms in the PRC ($2.3 trillion), the United States ($699 billion), and the Russian Federation \n($335 billion). \n \nD.   Enhanced Resilience to Disasters and Climate Change Vulnerabilities \n \nA final significant cobenefit to clean energy is minimizing the eventual, severe impacts of climate \nchange as well as improvements in resilience and adaptive capacity to natural disasters. The primary \nclimatic benefits of clean energy stem from the fact that immediate efforts can stop the buildup of \nGHGs  in  our  atmosphere.  As  climate  scientist  James  Hansen  et  al.  (2008)  argue,  mitigation  is \nhumanity\u2019s best path for \u201cpreserving a planet similar to that on which civilization depended and to \nwhich life on Earth is adapted\u201d (Hansen et al. 2008). Immediate GHG emission reductions are needed \nto keep concentrations of these gases to within a 500\u2013550 parts per million (ppm) range. As the IPCC \n(2014) implied in their latest global assessment, delaying invites disaster. \n \nAnother argument found in the literature is that clean energy and transport investments can \nenhance adaptation and resilience, making it easier for physical or natural systems to cope with climate \nchange. Reducing the energy intensity of agriculture through better irrigation and less fertilization can \nalso create farming techniques that are more resilient to drought (The Economist 2010). More efficient \nspace  cooling  and  heating  can  reduce  electricity  consumption  while  also  making  cooling  more \naffordable  for  lower  income  groups  (Sovacool  and  Brown  2009).  Displacing  the  need  for  the \nexploration and drilling of offshore oil can prevent GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion while \ndiminishing the risk of oil spills and consequent stress on ecosystems (adaptation). Energy efficiency \nprograms can reduce energy use and cut consumers\u2019 energy bills, translating into greater financial \nresilience to future shocks (Moser and Boykoff 2013). \n \nSome investments, such as energy efficiency, can improve resilience in other ways. It has been \nestimated that, for instance, every dollar invested in energy efficiency mitigates uncertainty associated \nwith reduced load, wear, and maintenance needs of the entire fossil fuel chain, even in hours when \nreliability problems were not anticipated by system managers. This is because efficiency gains depress \nthe costs of locally used fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas, and reduced demand in peak hours, the \nmost expensive times to produce power. Efficiency gains also lessened costly pollutants and emissions \nfrom  generators,  improved  the  reliability  of  existing  generators,  and  moderated  transmission \n ", "14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \ncongestion problems. Furthermore, these initiatives, once put in place, were always at hand\u2014available \nwithout  delay  or  the  needed  intervention  by  system  operators  (Cowart  2001).  The  New  York \nIndependent Systems Operator, for example, sets a reserve criterion of 18% during times of peak \ndemand to ensure overall system reliability. Accordingly, each megawatt-hour (MWh) of peak demand \nthat customers avoid through energy efficiency means that utilities can subtract 1.18 MWh of total \ncapacity needed. Quite literally, every single kilowatt-hour avoided through energy efficiency equates \nto 1.18 kWh of avoided supply (Komanoff 2002).  \n \nE.   Trade-Offs and Complexities \n \nThis is not to say that cleaner stoves, renewable sources of electricity, efficiency and clean transport \nare  without  challenges  or  trade-offs.  One  study  investigated  five  distinct  strategic  approaches \ndesigned to lessen a country\u2019s dependence on imported fuels, provide energy services at the cheapest \nprice possible, enable universal access to electricity grids, mitigate GHG emissions, and foster energy \nsystems that can operate under conditions of water stress and scarcity (Sovacool and Saunders 2014). \nThe study concluded that each of the five strategies were, more often than not, in conflict with each \nother. A group that supports climate change mitigation might support a ramped-up presence for \nnuclear power, whereas a group supporting water security might seek to phase out nuclear power. No \nsingle strategy optimized all energy security criteria. \n \nThus, one pertinent aspect of progressive energy and transport policy appears to be that \nvarious  components  have  the  potential  to  trade  off  with  each  other.  Encouraging  demand-side \nmanagement and energy efficiency can reduce peak congestion on electric power grids but would \ndirectly cut into the profitability of building natural gas peaking plants (Sovacool 2008). Energy taxes \ncan promote efficiency and minimize waste, but also disfavor energy producers, especially Western \nand Gulf producers of oil and gas and global suppliers of coal (Kalicki and Goldwyn 2005).  \n \nRapid changes in fuel efficiency and fuel economy requirements can lower dependence on oil \nbut  impose  costs  on  automobile  manufacturers  that  can  reduce  employment  and  hurt \ncompetitiveness. Creating a more efficient network of roads could lower congestion and improve \nautomobile fuel economy in Indonesia, but would also only make it easier to extract and distribute \ncoal, accelerating coal depletion and coal-related GHG emissions. Shifting from one reliable electricity \nsource (such as hydroelectricity) to wind energy (intermittent and distributed) and coal (prone to \nvolatile prices and GHG emission) would increase diversification, but could worsen overall system \ndependability.  Diversification  from  historically  cheap  sources  such  as  coal  and  hydro  to  more \nexpensive ones such as wind and solar can improve availability but conflict with affordability and can \nalso exacerbate dependence on foreign technologies that local planners may not own (Sovacool \n2010). \n \nThis litany of trade-offs is emblematic of how improving some aspects of energy policy, or \ncapturing cobenefits, can inherently conflict with other meaningful dimensions. We see such trade-\noffs in each of the four case studies explored in the next section.  \n \n \nIV.   EXEMPLARY CASE STUDIES FROM ASIA \n \nThis section of the paper focuses on how to capture cobenefits in practice, concentrating its analysis \non  four  case  studies  that  span  different  sectors  (cooking,  electricity,  efficiency,  and  transport), \ncountries (Indonesia, the PRC, Japan, and Singapore), and time frames. Despite this heterogeneity of ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   15 \ncases, each follows the same structure. It begins by briefly summarizing a historical description of the \ncase  examined  before  moving  to  discuss  its  cobenefits  and  finally  challenges  and  trade-offs \nencountered.  \n \nA.   Cookstoves in Indonesia, 2007\u20132012 \n \nIndonesia ran a large rural energy household program focusing on the conversion from kerosene stoves \nto liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves (Budya and Arofat 2011). In 2007, planners initiated a massive \nenergy program to convert primary household cooking fuels from kerosene to LPG in more than \n40 million households in less than 5 years. When it ended in 2012, the program had been implemented \nin 23 provinces throughout Indonesia, with 43.9 million conversion packages provided to citizens as of \n2012. Thirteen provinces were designated as \u201cclosed and dry,\u201d meaning that distribution of the \ufb01rst \npackages  was  completed  and  all  subsidized  kerosene  was  withdrawn.  The  program  enabled  the \nnational gas company Pertamina to withdraw 8.2 million kiloliters of kerosene in 2012 and replace it \nwith 3.2 million tons of LPG. This household \u201cmegaproject\u201d provided an improved household cooking \nfuel, with its associated bene\ufb01ts in user costs, cleanliness, convenience, and environment, and reduced \nthe government\u2019s huge subsidy for petroleum fuels. \n \nThe two most direct benefits have been reduced subsidies for kerosene and cost savings for \nhouseholds. In 2012, the Government of Indonesia reported that they were able to reduce the state\u2019s \ngross subsidy for kerosene by $6.9 billion due to the success of the LPG program (Bakar and Hashim \n2011). Moreover, several surveys of LPG consumers have confirmed their overall satisfaction\u2014and \ncost savings\u2014under the program. A large majority of the recipients of conversion packages said that \nthey can cook faster, have a cleaner kitchen, and, most importantly, reduce their expenditure for \ncooking fuel by approximately 30% (Pertamina Indonesia and WLPGA 2013). \n \nPerhaps  the  most  significant  indirect  benefit  has  been  jobs  and  economic  development \nthrough the creation of new industrial facilities. Most notable among these include the construction of \n8 new LPG terminals, 53 LPG cylinder factories, 31 stove factories, 14 regulator producers, and 22 \ufb01lling \nstations. In 2009, program evaluations estimated that the program generated $1.7 billion of investment \nacross these types of facilities along with 28,000 new jobs (Budya and Arofat 2011). A second indirect \nbenefit  has  been  displaced  emissions\u2014with  government  audits  suggesting  that  the  program  has \nreduced kerosene consumption by 6 million kiloliters pear year, equivalent to 8.4 million tons of carbon \ndioxide saved annually.  \n \nAchieving these cobenefits, of course, has not come without challenges. Some women have \nexpressed a concern that the new stoves cook food too quickly; that is, they had grown accustomed to \nthe fuel amounts and timing associated with an older stove and became quickly frustrated when the \nnew stove \u201cruined\u201d their meals (Sovacool and Drupady 2012). Moreover, the new stoves may not meet \na family\u2019s entire cooking needs\u2014families may wish to boil, bake, and broil with other cooking devices\u2014\nand they still depend primarily on fuelwood in some locations, meaning they contribute to some of the \nburdens associated with its collection and use (Masera, Saatkamp, and Kammen 2000). In addition, \nthe use of LGP, a fossil fuel, does conflict in a way with the stated goals of environmental sustainability \nand social well-being (Smith and Dutta 2011). Lastly, by focusing only on cooking, an admittedly \nlaudable goal, the program did not enable other types of energy services such as electricity, productive \nand mechanical energy, or mobility needed to achieve modern lifestyles and levels of access (Sovacool \net al. 2012). \n \n ", "16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \nB.   Renewable Electricity in the People\u2019s Republic of China, 1988\u20132015 \n \nOur second case study deals with renewable electricity in the PRC. The PRC arguably began to \npromote renewable electricity seriously as early as 1988, when the central government first gave the \nNational Development and Reform Commission responsibility for coordinating official positions in \nthen-upcoming international climate talks. More recently, the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (FYP), adopted \nby the Government of the PRC in March 2011, has brought environmental and climate-oriented \nconcerns to the forefront of national policy. Its targets included decreasing carbon intensity (carbon \nemissions per unit GDP) by 17% by 2015, increasing share of nonfossil energy in total energy mix from \ncurrent 8.3% to 11.4% by 2015, and increasing research and development (R&D) expenditures on \ncleaner forms of energy supply from 1.8% GDP to 2.2% GDP (Xinghua News Service 2011).4  New \nrenewable energy production has also been driven by international trends such as the global market for \ncarbon credits. As of 2010, roughly half of the certified emission reductions (CERs) in circulation under \nthe Kyoto Protocol were produced by projects in the PRC, with roughly a third of the PRC\u2019s CERs being \nproduced by wind projects (Fogarty 2011). In particular, on 27 February 2012, the PRC\u2019s National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission announced a plan to develop a national quota regime intended \nto encourage renewable energy development (China Daily 2012). This system will define a required \nmix of renewable and conventional electricity sources to be applied on a region-by-region basis (Wang \n2012). \n \nSuch targets do seem to be catalyzing the growth and acceptance of low-carbon technologies. \nIn 2013, the PRC led the world in the largest amount of renewable energy capacity installed that year, \nand it ranked first in six different categories of renewable energy. It was home to approximately a fifth \nof the world\u2019s renewable power capacity, with an estimated 229,000 MW of hydropower capacity in \naddition to about 90,000 MW of other renewables (mostly wind) (REN21 2013; reporting data for \n2012). Renewables, including hydro, met 27.5% of the country\u2019s electricity supply, a share almost twice \nthat of the United States. In the PRC, for the first time ever, wind power generation increased more \nthan generation from coal and surpassed and exceeded the output of nuclear power plants (REN21 \n2013). Behind the United States and Brazil, the PRC is also currently the third-largest producer of \nbiofuels in the world. Table 5 presents slightly more updated data that show the PRC leading the world \nin annual investments in hydropower, solar photovoltaic, wind power, and solar water heating, in \naddition to leading the world for total renewable power installed including and excluding hydropower \nas well as total wind energy capacity (REN21 2015). \n \nTaken collectively, these policies and trends are meaningfully altering the trajectory of the \nPRC\u2019s energy sector. Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicted in 2013 that the PRC will add an \nadditional 1,583 gigawatts (GW) of new electricity capacity to its grid by 2030, and that renewable \npower will represent more than half of these new additions, meaning that renewable energy reaches \n\u201cthe same capacity level\u201d as coal in 2030. That report forecast that \u201ccoal-fired power generation will \ndecrease from 67% in 2012 to 44% in 2030, or 25 GW annually, while renewable generation will \nincrease from 27% in 2012 to 44% in 2030, at 47 GW per year\u201d (Bayar 2013). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4   See also Finamore (2011).

Renewables Global Status Report. Paris; reporting data for 2014. \n \nThis rapid increase in renewable electricity adoption has faced some difficulties, however. One \nof them is a continued reliance on fossil fuels as well. The PRC government has been building new, \ndirty power plants at a frantic pace to keep up with demand. In the electricity sector, more than three-\nquarters of all coal-fired power plants worldwide were built in the PRC in 2010, enabling coal to \ncontribute  to  about  80%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity  generation.  The  PRC  coal  sector  employs \n7.8 million people and produces about 40% of the world\u2019s coal (WWF 2007). The resultant increase in \nGHG emissions from the coal plants added to the PRC grid in the last 5 years has already offset all of \nthe gains made by the Kyoto Protocol and collective voluntary efforts around the world over the same \nperiod (The Energy Collective 2012). \n \n \n ", "18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \nAs  such,  for  the  first  half  of  2013  the  PRC  government  reported  that  ambient  airborne \nparticulate concentrations in 74 of the PRC\u2019s largest cities are three times the level considered safe \nunder WHO guidelines (Bloomberg 2013). The World Bank similarly estimated that the economic \nburden  of  premature  mortality  associated  with  air  pollution  amounted  to  at  least  $63  billion\u2013\n$272 billion in damages or as much as 3.3%\u20137.0% of national GDP (Deng 2006; McMichael 2007). \nConsequently, WHO (2007) estimates that 275,600 people die annually because of outdoor air \npollution in the PRC. About 30% of river water is so polluted that it is considered unfit for agricultural, \nindustrial, and electrical purposes (Carmody et al. 2010). Two-thirds of the PRC\u2019s 660 largest cities \nsuffer from water shortages with 110 facing \u201csevere\u201d shortages, and water pollution throughout the \ncountry sickens at least 190 million people and causes 60,000 premature deaths every year (Economy \n2007). \n \nC.   Energy Efficiency in Japan, 1999\u20132012 \n \nJapan\u2019s Top Runner Program shows how adept and nimble government interventions can be at \npromoting the widespread use of best practices in energy efficiency (across industrial manufacturing \nand household use) by closely monitoring technological advances (Komiyama and Marnay 2008; \nSiderius and Nakagami 2012).5 Japan established the Top Runner Program in 1999 as a means of tying \nenergy efficiency standards, by category, to 19 different products, ranging from automobiles and \nrefrigerators to computers and DVD players, shown in Figure 4. Then, within a time period mandated \nby the government, the average of the weighted sales of each manufacturer and distributor must meet \nthat new energy standard.  \n \nAs  Figure  4  also  indicates,  these  savings  reach  as  high  as  a  67.8%  improvement  for  air \nconditioners, 78% for fluorescent lights, and 99.1% for computers over time. The program\u2019s goals are \nalso strengthened by the Japanese concern for corporate image: \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d companies for \nfailing to meet standards is a highly effective tool used by the government. The program is expected to \ndeliver $3 billion in benefits in markets for lighting, vehicles, and appliances. \n \nPerhaps the biggest single challenge facing the program, however, is the risk of a \u201crebound \neffect\u201d where consumers increase consumption to accommodate more efficient (and often cheaper) \nenergy use. Energy efficiency efforts such as Top Runner can decrease the marginal price for an energy \nservice, increasing demand of that service as consumers reinvest the gains in additional consumption \n(Owen 2010). A variant of this thinking is known as the Jevons paradox, and it argues that efficiently \nusing energy causes the overall cost of using energy to decrease. This, in essence, liberates resources \nfor people to use, often in activities that consume more net energy (Alcott 2005). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5   See also Kimura (2012).

The indirect effect occurs when the extra income is used to consume other appliances \nmore, leading to increased energy consumption (Greening, Greene, and Difiglio 2000). Though they \ndid not find a meaningful rebound effect (above 15%) in their own study, nor has it been applied \ndirectly to the Top Runner program, Chitnis et al. (2013) did survey the recent literature on the topic \nand present their findings\u2014across a broad array of areas including food, heating, electricity, and \ntransport\u2014in Table 6.

Mass Transit in Singapore, 1971\u20132009 \n \nSingapore relies on a mix of incentives and disincentives to promote more sustainable transport \ncentered on minimizing the use of private cars and maximizing the use of mass public transit. So-called \n\u201csticks\u201d raise the costs of driving a private automobile through purchase taxes and usage fees, whereas \n\u201ccarrots: encourage public transport and more efficient driving practices (Brown and Sovacool 2011). \nAs a sign of its success, the Singaporean Ministry of Transport estimates that almost 5 million trips ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   21 \n(about 60%) occur per day using mass rapid transit, light rail transit, and buses\u2014impressive figures \ngiven that the country has a population of less than 5 million people.  \n \nTable 6: Estimates of Direct and Indirect Rebound Effects for Households \n \nNumber of \nCommodity  Estimated \nGroups  Abatement  Effects  Rebound \nStudied  Action  Area  Measure  Captured  Energy/Emissions  Effect (%) \n150  Efficiency and  Food;  Greenhouse  Income Direct and indirect  45\u2013123\nsufficiency  heating  gases \n300  Sufficiency  Food;  Carbon Income Direct and indirect  7\u2013300\ntravel; \nutilities \n13  Efficiency  Transport;  Carbon Income and  Direct and indirect  120\u2013175\nutilities  substitution \n13  Efficiency  Transport;  Energy Income and  Direct and indirect  12\u201338\nutilities  substitution \n6  Efficiency  Transport;  Energy Income and  Direct only  37\u201386\nheating;  substitution \nelectricity \n16  Sufficiency  Transport;  Greenhouse  Income Direct and indirect  7\u201351\nheating;  gases \nfood \n74  Efficiency  Transport;  Greenhouse  Income Direct and indirect  7\u201325\nelectricity  gases \n36  Efficiency and  Transport;  Greenhouse  Income Direct and indirect  5\u201340\nsufficiency   lighting  gases \nSource: Modified from Chitnis, Mona, Steve Sorrell, Angela Druckman, Steven K.

Deeply \nshaped by the geography of Singapore and its limited resources of land, the project resulted in a \nconcept plan in 1971 that provided the framework for spatial and urban development oriented to \ncreating a city center and road corridors (the plan has since been updated in 1991 and 2001) (Barter \n2008). The project highlighted that patterns of driving and vehicle ownership were rapidly becoming \nunsustainable with the available land within Singapore and brought the matter of transport to the \nattention of senior government officials (Barter 2008). Officials responded by implementing a number \nof mechanisms to restrict the supply of, and curb demand for, private vehicles. The most influential of \nthese mechanisms are presented in Table 7.  \n \nThese innovative mechanisms would not have been nearly as successful if they had not been \ncoupled to rigorous investments in public transit. Efforts began in 1973 with improvements of buses, \nincluding the forced mergers of bus companies, followed by the imposition of a professional unified \nbus company in 1973, the reorganization and streamlining of bus routes, the banning of pirate or \nindependent taxis, and the creation of bus lanes in major corridors (Barter 2008; Santos et al. 2004). A \n$10 billion mass rapid transit (MRT) rail system opened in 1987 to support the already extensive \n12,600 buses and 20,000 taxis in the city and light rapid transit. A fully automated rail system \nequivalent to the \u201cPeople Movers\u201d found in the United States was added in 1999.  \n \n ", "22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \nTable 7: Major Measures Introduced to Curb Road Congestion in Singapore, 1972\u20132009 \n \nYear  Measure  Concise Description of Measures/Systems Success Rate \n1972  Additional  Extra levy imposed on new vehicle, priced at  Only initially.

Sovacool. 2011. Climate Change and Global Energy Security: Technology and Policy Options. \nCambridge, MA: MIT Press. \n \nThe collective benefits from Singapore's urban transport policies can be divided into four \nareas. First, Singapore has lower private vehicle ownership than other European and North American \ncities of similar size, economic activity, and income. While the fleet of vehicles in aggregate has more \nthan doubled from the 1970s to today, its expansion has barely outpaced population growth, with \nabout 100 cars per 1,000 people in 1970 and only 130 cars per 1,000 people in 2008, not counting \nforeigners and expatriates. \n \nSecond, Singapore's efforts have improved traffic flow and reduced congestion. The Area \nLicensing Scheme (ALS) system led to an almost immediate reduction in traffic by 50% and travel \nspeeds increased from an average of 17.7 kilometers per hour (km/h) to 33.8 km/h during the first year \nit operated. The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system has also reduced traffic volume into the central \nbusiness district by about 10%\u201315% during peak operation hours as compared to the ALS (Brown and \nSovacool 2011), and it has shifted driving habits so that morning peak traffic is down 7.2%, midday \ntraffic down 7.6%, and off-peak traffic up 28%  (Brown and Sovacool 2011). More than  95%  of \nexpressways, roads in the central business district, and arterial roads were \u201ccongestion free\u201d during ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   23 \npeak periods from 2006 to 2008.6 Congestion pricing and information schemes are estimated to have \nincreased traffic throughput at intersections and expressways with a net cost savings of $30 million per \nyear due to shorter delays and less time spent in traffic jams; less congestion also serves to lubricate \ncommerce and increase productivity. This means that the entire Singaporean transport network is \nmore efficient, with motorized passenger travel in Singapore consuming about 12,000 megajoules per \ncapita (MJ/cap) compared to 30,000 MJ/cap for a typical Australian city (Barter 2008). \n \nThird, taxes, fees, and programs such as the Vehicle Quota System (VQS) and ERP provide the \ngovernment  with  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  of  revenue.  Fixed  vehicle  taxes,  purchase  and \nownership fees, and the Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) account for about a fifth of all government \nrevenue, creating funds that are then invested back into transportation infrastructure along with \nhousing, education, health care, and other socially desirable programs. While the implementation of \nthe ERP system cost about $1.4 billion, annual revenue from the program was initially $350 million and \noperating costs only $7 million, meaning the system paid for itself in 5 years (Brown and Sovacool \n2011). Currently, the ERP costs $20 million\u2013$25 million to operate but produces annual revenues of \n$100 million.  \n \nFourth, many components of the transport system are cheaper than other major metropolitan \nareas. The average price of an MRT ride in Singapore is $0.91 compared to $1.15 for New York and \nTokyo; $1.40 for Hong Kong, China; and $2.45 for London; the average price of a bus ride is $0.67 for \nSingapore but $0.87 for New York; $0.96 for London; $1.11 for Hong Kong, China; and $1.38 for Tokyo. \nMostly because of improved traffic flow, the average peak taxi fare for a 9-kilometer drive in Singapore \nis $9.39 compared to $12.35 in Hong Kong, China; $14.62 for New York; and $24.56 for London (Land \nTransport Authority 2008). \n \nNonetheless, Singapore continues to face a host of transport-related challenges. First comes \nincreasing  demand  for  travel  and  aspirations  for  the  ownership  of  private  automobiles.  The \nSingaporean Land Transport Authority expects private travel demand to increase from 8.9 million \njourneys a day in 2008 to about 14.3 million journeys a day by 2020 (Land Transport Authority 2008). \nOver the period between 1997 and 2004, however, the share of public transport during morning peak \nhours dropped from 67% to 63%. Less than 15% of people commuted to work by car in 1980, but about \na quarter did in 2000 (Brown and Sovacool 2011), and the total vehicle population grew from 670,000 \nin 1996 to 850,000 in 2007 (Land Transport Authority 2008). The number of vehicular trips has \ngrown by more than a factor of three, from 2.7 million trips in 1981 to 7.8 million trips in 2005 (Brown \nand Sovacool 2011). At the same time, Singapore is running out of space for cars, with 12% of its land \narea already occupied by roads and little physical space for growth. Even the VQS, which now restricts \ncar ownership to a growth rate of 1.5% per year, still permits ownership to grow substantially over time.  \n \nWith  rising  levels  of  affluence  and  changing  demographics,  the  expectations  for  many \nSingaporeans have been realigned to value the increased mobility and luxury offered by private \nautomobiles. In absolute terms, the number of vehicles (and associated GHG emissions with operating \nthem) continues to increase. The falling cost of cars due to increased competition from overseas \nsuppliers and the availability of cheaper models only adds to this challenge, with a new Toyota Corolla \ncosting about $66,000 (inclusive of all taxes and fees) in the 1990s but only $40,000 today, and even \nless expensive automobiles from the PRC and the Republic of Korea running for less than $30,000, all \n                                                 \n6   \u201cPercentage congestion free\u201d is defined as the percentage of expressways with average speed above 45 km/h or \npercentage of CBD and/or arterial roads with average speed above 20 km/h. \n ", "24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 502 \ninclusive. These falling costs may motivate people to purchase the maximum number of cars permitted \nunder the VQS. \n \nFurthermore, many of Singapore\u2019s policies have been technology and/or capital intensive. The \nERP, for example, employs a combination of complex radio frequencies, imaging, and smart card \ntechnologies,  optical  detection,  cameras,  and  computers  working  simultaneously.  The  system \nnecessitated 10 years of planning, testing, and preparation including a pilot program that involved \nfitting 250 vehicles with vehicle transponders and 4.8 million transactions (Brown and Sovacool 2011). \nBefore the ERP began operation, the government managed a free program to outfit 97% of all vehicles \nin Singapore with transponders. Foreign cars visiting Singapore must pay to rent a battery-powered \ndevice so they can travel on ERP roads. Each of these policies required substantial amounts of time, \nhuman resources, and money to implement. \n \nLastly, the urban transport policies in Singapore, while they have helped curb traffic and \ncongestion, have still heavily favored motorized forms of transport. That is, they have given a high \npriority to maintaining traffic flow for automobiles, buses, and taxis, and incentivizing commuters to \nuse the MRT. This trend may be counterintuitive to attempts to improve the safety of nonmotorized \nforms  of  transport  (such  as  walking,  jogging,  running,  skating,  or  bicycling),  and  eliminating  the \ncongestion of private automobiles also removes the speed advantages for mass transit (Brown and \nSovacool 2011). Plans for the future also reflect this bias, with much discussion of community car-\nowning schemes, an expansion of the off-peak program, and a transition to electric vehicles, but less \neffort to encourage walking and biking. \n \n \nV.   CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY INSIGHTS \n \nAt least four distinct conclusions and policy implications can be derived from the data in this paper. \nFirst, low-carbon forms of energy supply and infrastructure have immense positive and admittedly \ndifficult-to-monetize cobenefits. Cleaner forms of cooking have immense health benefits and massive \nvalue in reduced morbidity and mortality and corresponding avoided health-care costs that could \nreach into the trillions of dollars each year. Renewable sources of electricity not only provide electrons \nand kilowatt-hours, they do so in ways that generate more jobs per unit of energy delivered and \nenhance diversification and energy security. Investments in energy efficiency have been shown to \nenhance innovation and economic competitiveness, generate economic returns, improve resilience, \nand displace GHG emissions and other forms of pollution at the same time. Low-carbon urban \ntransport infrastructure has been demonstrated to reduce traffic congestion, minimize GHG emissions \nand pollution, and create an affordable, popular platform for transit simultaneously. These benefits, \nmoreover, are proportional to the amount invested in a particular policy or the volumes and scale \neconomies achieved by particular forms of technological diffusion. Simply put, the more invested, the \nexponentially greater degree of cobenefits gained.  \n \nSecond, achieving these benefits required strong government commitment in each case, as \nwell as a progression of policy instruments implemented consistently over time. Indonesia\u2019s LGP \nproject  was  steered  at  the  executive  level  by  the  country\u2019s  Vice-President  and  worked  only  by \nstimulating cookstove adoption while also disincentivizing the use of kerosene through the repeal of \nsubsidies. The PRC\u2019s promotion of renewable electricity has depended on strong state support in the \nform of binding national targets, adherence to the Kyoto Protocol and the global carbon credit market, \nand (most recently) discussions of emissions trading. Energy efficiency in Japan depended on state-led \ntargets  enforced  through  strict  financial  penalties  as  well  as  publicly  \u201cshaming\u201d  poor  industrial ", "Cobenefits and Trade-Offs of Green and Clean Energy   |   25 \nperformers. Singapore has pursued a synergetic approach to urban transport policy that involves both \n\u201csupply-side\u201d and \u201cdemand-side\u201d elements as well as \u201ccarrots\u201d and \u201csticks\u201d (Brown and Sovacool \n2011).  Aspects  have  included  restraint  of  vehicle  ownership  and  vehicle  moratoriums,  steady \nimprovement of public mass transit, road pricing schemes, and the provision of real-time information \nto drivers. \u201cSupply-side\u201d components have invested in train and bus infrastructure and constructed \nelectronic road pricing schemes, whereas \u201cdemand-side\u201d components attempt to alter behavior in \nfavor of public mass transit by restricting the number of private vehicles through quota systems and \nhigher vehicle fees. Stable, consistent, and strong government support is a common theme in all of \nthese cases; governments did not let markets or other actors lead. Put another way, markets will not \ncapture cobenefits on their own; the examples from Indonesia, the PRC, Japan, and Singapore are not \nnecessarily \u201ccost-effective\u201d in markets where fossil fuels are free and/or no price for externalities such \nas carbon exists. Correcting market and policy failures is not always costly in economic terms (use of \nresources and other inputs), but reform initiatives must confront a serious array of challenges including \npolitical difficulties, distributional consequences, social barriers, and analytical difficulties. \n \nThird, and drawing from this point about difficulty, more research is needed and considerable \ngaps exist. More specific recommendations on how to deal with the trade-offs in each country\u2014and \nothers not listed\u2014would be useful, as would creating a typology of possible policy pathways for \nidentifying and maximizing cobenefits. Efforts, for instance, could center on a mix of technology \nprogress  (e.g.,  sharp  decline  in  solar  and  wind  power  costs),  removing  subsidies  on  fossil  fuels, \ndeveloping local manufacturing capacity for clean solutions, and good business models. Shorter-term \nor easier to achieve research objectives could include: \n \n\uf0b7  ranking projects by cobenefit returns, \n\uf0b7  creating more credible fiscal frameworks, \n\uf0b7  highlighting the benefits of opportunistic investment in green and clean projects (the \nwinners and the positive distributional aspects), and \n\uf0b7  managing fiscal policy in a timely fashion. \n \nLonger-term or more difficult to achieve objectives could include: \n \n\uf0b7  concentrating on correcting market and policy failures that could impede the growth of \nrapidly expanding green and energy sectors; \n\uf0b7  considering past path dependence, need for scale, and the role of domestic \nendowments; \n\uf0b7  pricing energy and reforming subsidies; and \n\uf0b7  manufacturing credible policies that are \u201clong, loud, and legal.\u201d \n \nIn addition, a well-designed business engagement process could improve upscaling efforts. \nFigure 5 offers a sketch of how such a platform may look.

To be sure, each \ncountry is unique and each program had to confront challenges. Indonesia saw user resistance to \ncleaner and faster cooking devices by some households; the PRC\u2019s scramble for energy has forced it to \npush for both renewable and fossil-fueled electricity at the same time; Japan\u2019s energy efficiency \nsavings may be offset by partial rebound effects; and Singapore continues to see the rise of private cars \ndespite  strong  disincentives.  Nevertheless,  these  cases  also  serve  as  empirical  success\u2014living \nlaboratories, so to speak\u2014where aggressive clean energy and climate policies have overcome the usual \nobstacles to successfully meet targets and reach impressive milestones.

It first defines what \nis meant by \u201cclean\u201d energy across the four technological systems of cooking, renewable electricity, energy \nefficiency, and urban transport. It summarizes at least four general types of cobenefits to investing in these \nsystems: (i) diversification and enhanced energy security, (ii) jobs and green growth, (iii) displaced pollution \nand associated cost savings, and (iv) enhanced resilience and adaptive capacity to things like climate change \nand natural disasters. The next part focuses on four case studies of where cobenefits have been delivered \nin practice: liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia, renewable electricity generation in the People\u2019s \nCOBENEfiTs AND TrADE-Offs \nRepublic of China, energy efficiency in Japan, and mass transit in Singapore. \nOf GrEEN AND ClEAN ENErGy: \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nEviDENCE frOm ThE ACADEmiC \nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \nliTErATurE AND AsiAN CAsE \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
