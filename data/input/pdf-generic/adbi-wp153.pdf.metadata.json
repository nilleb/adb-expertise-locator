The  severe  collapse  of  industrial  production  that \nfollowed  was  no  doubt  attributable  to  a  confluence  of  factors,  but  the  paper  highlights  the \nimpact that came from the contractionary effect of global deleveraging on the real economy. \nIn this environment, Japan was particularly vulnerable because of the structural changes that \nhad  taken  place  over  the  past  decade  in  its  trade  and  industrial  structures.  Vector \nautoregression  analysis  confirms  that,  as  a  result  of  these  structural  changes,  Japanese \noutput  became  much  more  responsive  to  output  shocks  in  the  advanced  markets  of  the \nUnited States and Western Europe. \n\nThe structural changes had two components. First, over 90% of Japan\u2019s exports consisted of \nhighly  income-elastic  industrial  supplies,  capital  goods,  and  consumer  durables.  Though \nemerging  Asia  is  Japan\u2019s  largest  export  market,  its  imports  from  Japan  largely  consist  of \nintermediate goods used in the production of final goods destined for the US and  Western \nEurope.  Second,  Japan\u2019s  trade  dependence  had  increased  since  the  early  2000s,  as \nevidenced  by  a  rising  export  to  gross  domestic  product  ratio  and  a  declining  share  for  the \nnon-tradable  sector.  Though  increasing  trade  openness  is  a  natural  part  of  economic \nglobalization and regional integration, the manner in which this process had played out made \nJapan particularly vulnerable to a negative demand shock coming from outside.  \n\nTo make Japan more resilient to external shocks, policymakers could promote the export of \nfinished  goods  to  emerging  Asia  by  establishing  a  region-wide  free  trade  arrangement.  To \npromote domestic demand, the social protection system needs to be strengthened so as to \nreduce households\u2019 uncertainty for the future; a more liberal immigration policy should help \ninvigorate  private  investment  in  an  aging  society.  To  facilitate  a  better  allocation  of \nresources,  further  deregulatory  measures  in  the  more  regulated  non-tradable  goods  sector \nare  called  for;  a  substantial  lifting  of  restrictions  in  agriculture,  especially  regarding  the \ncorporatization  of  production,  would  be  especially  helpful.  With  little  available  fiscal  space, \nthese measures will help create a climate in which private investment can flourish, driven by \nfinal domestic demand. \n\n \n \nJEL Classification: F40, F41 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\nContents \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nIntroduction .................................................................................................................. 1 \n\nWhat Happened? ........................................................................................................ 3 \n\nWhy It Happened ......................................................................................................... 6 \n\n3.1 \n3.2 \n\nJapan\u2019s Trade Structure .................................................................................. 6 \nJapan\u2019s Industrial Structure ............................................................................. 7 \n\nQuantifying the Nature of the Structural Change ....................................................... 10 \n\nConclusion ................................................................................................................. 13 \n\nReferences ............................................................................................................................ 15 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nJapan  was  hit  hard  by  the  global  financial  crisis  of  2008-2009;  it  was  the  only  major \nadvanced  economy  that  experienced  negative  economic  growth  in  2008  and  continues  to \ncontract sharply in 2009 (Figure 1). Although most advanced countries are now in recession, \naccording to the latest World Economic Outlook (IMF, 2009a), the economic contraction that \nJapan will likely experience in 2009 (-6.2%) is forecast to surpass the projected contractions \nfor the United States (US) (-2.8%), the Euro Area (-4.2%),1 and the United Kingdom (-4.1%), \nwhere the financial crisis for the most part originated. Among the major economies, Japan is \nonly  surpassed  by  Singapore  (-10.0%)  and  Taipei,China  (-7.5%)  in  the  severity  of  the  real \nimpact of the global financial crisis. \n\nFigure 1: Economic Growth for Selected Countries in 2008 and 2009  \n(in %, annual change) \n\n10\n\n%\n\n0\n\n-10\n\nn\na\np\na\nJ\n\nS\nU\n\nK\nU\n\n \n\na\ne\nr\nA\no\nr\nu\nE\n\n,\n\n \n\ng\nn\no\nK\ng\nn\no\nH\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\na\ne\nr\no\nK\n\ne\nr\no\np\na\ng\nn\nS\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\n,\ni\ne\np\ni\na\nT\n\nC\nR\nP\n\na\ni\nd\nn\n\nI\n\na\ni\ns\ne\nn\no\nd\nn\n\nI\n\na\ni\ns\ny\na\nl\na\nM\n\nd\nn\na\nl\ni\na\nh\nT\n\nGrowth for 2008\n\nGrowth forecast for 2009\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2009a). \n\nWhen  the  US  subprime  loan  problem  came  to  the  surface  in  the  summer  of  2007,  many \nobservers thought that Japan was immune to the subsequent global deleveraging, given its \nlimited  exposure  to  \u201ctoxic\u201d  assets.  Indeed,  various  indicators  suggested  that  the  direct \nfinancial impact of the global financial crisis on Japan was relatively small. In fact, Japan\u2019s \nbanking  sector  in  particular  was  hardly  affected  directly,  as  was  evident  in  the  small \nestimated value of write-downs and the limited cost of public sector support which were only \na fraction of the corresponding amount in the US and Europe (Table 1). \n\n                                                 \n1 The  Euro  area  includes  16  countries:  Austria,  Belgium,  Cyprus,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Ireland, \n\nItaly, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nTable 1: The Direct Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on the US, Europe, and Japan \n\nCredit-related write-downs in the banking \nsector (in billions of US dollars) a \n\nPublic outlays for the banking \nsector (in billions of euro) b \n\n2,712\n1,193\n149\n\n825\n1,116\n3\n\n \n\nUS \nEurope c \nJapan \n\nNotes: \n\na IMF Estimates for 2007-10, as of April 2009. \n\n b The magnitude of government actions taken up to 10 June 2009, to intervene in the banking sector.  \n\nc Europe means France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. \n\nSources: International Monetary Fund (2009b), Table 1.3; Bank for International Settlements (2009), Table 1.2. \n\nWhen the US and much of Europe went into recession in early 2008 (Bosworth and Flaaen \n2009;  Wyplosz  2009),  Japan\u2019s  real  economy  did  not  seem  to  be  affected  materially. \nHowever, Japan was adversely affected by the large negative terms of trade shock in 2008, \nwith a sharp increase in energy and other commodity prices, but it still maintained positive \ngrowth  in  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  private  fixed  investment  through  the \nsecond quarter; export growth was steady through the third quarter (Figure 2). It was only in \nthe fourth quarter that the evidence of a severe economic contraction was apparent, with a \n12.5% (year-on-year) fall in exports. This was followed by a 36.8% fall in the first quarter of \n2009.  Similarly,  industrial  production  also  contracted  sharply;  it  declined  by  15.0%,  34.0% \nand 27.6% (year-on-year) in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first and second quarters of \n2009,  respectively.  This  decline  was  one  of  the  worst  among  the  major  developed \ncountries\u2014in  Europe  and  North  America\u2014and  Asian  economies.  When  Japan  was  finally \nhit, the impact was indeed very severe. \n\nFigure 2: Growth Rates of GDP and Its Components \n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\n%\n \n\n(\n\ny\no\ny\n\n2006Q1\n\n2007Q1\n\n2008Q1\n\n2009Q1\n\n) Exports\n\nPrivate fixed investment\n\nPrivate consumtion\n\nReal GDP\n\nSource: Japan Cabinet Office (available: www.esri.cao.jp/jpsna). \n\nWhy  was  Japan  hit  so  hard  by  the  global  financial  crisis  when  its  financial  system  was \nconsidered  much  more  robust  than  those  in  other  developed  countries?  The  rest  of  this \npaper attempts to offer an explanation in the following sequence. Section 2 describes what \nhappened in terms of manufacturing production and exports. Section 3 argues that the sharp \ncontraction of economic activity occurred largely as a result of the structural changes in the \nJapanese  economy  that  had  taken  place  over  the  past  decade.  Section  4  quantifies  the \nimpact  of  the  structural  changes  on  the  responsiveness  of  Japanese  output  to  global \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\ndemand  shocks  by  using  a  vector  autoregression  (VAR)  model  of  the  world  economy. \nFinally, Section 5 offers concluding remarks. \n\n2.  WHAT HAPPENED? \n\nJapanese stock prices reached a recent peak in the summer of 2007 and, with the outbreak \nof  the  US  subprime  loan  crisis,  began  a  gradual  but  substantial  decline  through  the  fall  of \n2008. The decline in stock prices placed a strain on the balance sheet and capital adequacy \nratios of commercial banks and, as a result, limited their willingness to lend by the summer \nof 2008. The Lehman Brothers shock in September 2008 further depressed the stock market \nand aggravated the strains on Japanese commercial banks. Bank of Japan data indicate that \nnew  loans  for  equipment  funds  declined  by  9%  (year-on-year)  in  the  third  quarter  of  2008, \nfollowed by a 10% decline in the fourth quarter. This, coupled with the lagged impact of the \nnegative terms of trade shock (arising from the sharp rise in oil and other commodity prices \nuntil the summer of 2008), may to some extent explain the sluggishness of industrial activity \nin some sectors starting from the summer of 2008 (see below). \n\nEven  so,  overall  manufacturing  production  held  up  through  September  and  October  2008 \n(Figure  3).  Notable  exceptions  were  electronic  parts  and  devices  as  well  as  transportation \nequipment,  the  production  of  which  had  shown  earlier  signs  of  softening.  In  November, \nhowever, manufacturing production collapsed precipitously in all major sectors (from 100 in \nOctober to 93, seasonally adjusted). Overall manufacturing production continued to fall and \nreached  70  in  February  2009  before  recovering  somewhat.  The  collapse  was  even  more \nspectacular  for  transportation  equipment  (52  in  February  2009  compared  with  110  in \nSeptember 2008) and general machinery (59 compared with 99). The production of general \nmachinery remained depressed even after production began to pick up in other sectors from \nthe spring of 2009. \n\nFigure 3: Japanese Industrial Production (2005=100) \n\n150\n\n130\n\n110\n\n90\n\n70\n\n50\n\n7\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n7\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n8\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n8\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n9\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n9\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n9\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\nTotal manufacturing\nElectrical machinery\nTransportation equipment\n\nGeneral machinery\nElectronic parts and devices\n\nSource: Ministry of Economy and Industry (available: www.meti.go.jp/statistics/tyo/iip). \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nThe downward movement of industrial production closely followed the downward movement \nof exports. Although the major factor behind the collapse of Japanese exports was a world-\nwide shrinkage of demand and trade following the Lehman shock, the sharp appreciation of \nthe yen was an additional blow to Japan\u2019s export-oriented firms.2 The total value of exports, \nwhich stood at 7,360 billion yen (\u00a5) in September 2008, declined moderately to \u00a56,915 billion \nin  October  and  collapsed  thereafter.  Exports  in  January  2009,  at  \u00a53,480  billion,  were  less \nthan 50% of the previous peak in September 2008. The decline was across the board, but \nmost  pronounced  in  the  export  of  industrial  supplies,  capital  equipment,  and  consumer \ndurables, Japan\u2019s three main categories of export products (which together account for over \n90% of Japan\u2019s total exports). The decline was also registered not only for exports to the US \nand Western Europe (which together account for over 40% of Japan\u2019s total exports), where \nthe financial crisis originated, but also for exports to emerging and developing Asia, Japan\u2019s \nlargest export market now accounting for over 50% of total exports (Figures 4\u20136). \n\nFigure 4: Japanese Exports to Emerging Asia by Product Category \n\nn\ne\ny\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nB\n\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n0\n\n7\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n7\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n8\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n8\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n9\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\nIndustrial supplies Capital equipment Consumer durables\n\nSources: Japan Tariff Association (2007, 2008, and 2009) (available: kanzei.or.jp/English/index.htm). \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2 The  nominal  value  of  the  yen  appreciated  by  17%  against  the  US  dollar  and  by  27%  against  the  euro,  from \n\nSeptember 2008 to January 2009. \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nFigure 5: Japanese Exports to the US by Product Category \n\n7\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n7\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n8\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n8\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n9\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\nIndustrial supplies Capital equipment Consumer durables\n\nSources: Japan Tariff Association (2007, 2008, and 2009) (available: kanzei.or.jp/English/index.htm). \n\nFigure 6: Japanese Exports to Western Europe by \n\nProduct\n\nn\ne\ny\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nB\n\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\nn\ne\ny\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nB\n\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\n7\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n7\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n8\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n8\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n9\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\nIndustrial supplies Capital equipment Consumer durables\n\nSources: Japan Tariff Association (2007, 2008, and 2009) (available: kanzei.or.jp/English/index.htm). \n\nOf the decline in exports of \u00a53,880 billion from September 2008 to January 2009, emerging \n(and developing) Asia accounted for over 51%, which is roughly the share of emerging Asia \nin  Japan\u2019s  total  exports.  This  implies  that  Japanese  exports  collapsed  almost  uniformly \nacross  destination  markets.  The  composition  of  export  declines,  however,  differed  across \nregions,  reflecting  the  different  content  of  trade.  Within  emerging  Asia,  86%  of  the  decline \nwas  in  industrial  supplies  and  capital  goods,  whereas  this  share  for  the  US  and  Western \nEurope was smaller at 60%. On the other hand, only 6% of the export decline for emerging \nAsia was consumer durables, while the share for the advanced markets was larger at 36%.3 \nThis is a reflection of the fact that, though emerging Asia is the largest export market, it is not \n                                                 \n3 US  imports,  on  a  customs  basis,  declined  by  more  than  30%  from  July  to  December  2008;  the  import  of \n\ntransportation equipment showed an even sharper decline of about 40%. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nthe  dominant  market  for  consumer  durables;  more  consumer  durables  are  shipped  to  the \nadvanced markets of the US and Western Europe. \n\nEssentially,  the  export  of  industrial  supplies  and  capital  goods  to  emerging  Asia  was  most \nseverely  affected  as  the  region\u2019s  demand  for  Japanese  parts,  components,  and  capital \ngoods\u2014all  critical  inputs  for  the  production  of  final  consumer  products\u2014declined  steeply. \nJapan was affected by the shrinkage of \u201ctriangular trade\u201d where Japan and the Asian newly \nindustrialized  economies  (the  Republic  of  Korea  (hereafter  Korea),  Singapore,  and \nTaipei,China)  export  parts  and  components  to  the  PRC  and  other  emerging  Asian \neconomies, which in turn assemble them to produce final products for the US and European \nmarkets. Thus, Japanese exports collapsed because both the export of consumer durables \nto the advanced markets and the export of industrial supplies and capital goods to emerging \nAsia  fell  sharply,  as  a  consequence  of  the  contraction  of  private  consumption  and  the \nsoftening of investment spending in the US and Europe. \n\n3.  WHY IT HAPPENED \n\nThere are two aspects to the mechanism whereby Japan\u2019s output was so much affected by \nthe collapse of exports in late 2008 and early 2009, Japan\u2019s trade structure and its industrial \nstructure. We will examine each of these. \n\n3.1  Japan\u2019s Trade Structure \n\nAs  noted  in  the  previous  section,  over  90%  of  Japanese  exports  consist  of  highly  income-\nelastic  industrial  supplies,  capital  goods,  and  consumer  durables.  Hence  a  collapse  of  the \nUS and European markets exerted a severe negative influence on Japanese exports. Japan \nwas  not  alone  in  this.  Sommer  (2009)  shows  that  economies  with  a  greater  share  of \nadvanced manufacturing in GDP tended to experience sharper output declines than others, \nwith  Singapore  and  Taipei,China  belonging  to  this  group  of  economies.  In  Japan,  as \ndiscussed  above,  both  the  export  of  consumer  durables  to  the  advanced  markets \n(accounting  for  less  than  15%  of  total  exports)  and  the  export  of  industrial  supplies  and \ncapital goods to emerging Asia (constituting over 40% of total exports) were adversely and \nseverely  affected  by  the  financial  crisis.  In  particular,  the  export  of  industrial  supplies  and \ncapital goods declined along with the softening of investment demand throughout the world. \n\nMuch has been said about the recent growth of intra-regional trade within Asia (see Kawai \nand Urata 2004; Takagi and Kozuru 2009). For example, within the member countries of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the PRC, Japan, and Korea (ASEAN+3), \nthe  share  of  intra-regional  trade  rose  from  around  30%  during  1980-1990  to  over  38%  in \n2006; with Hong Kong, China and Taipei,China included, the share was almost 55%. Closely \nrelated  to  intra-regional  trade  is  intra-regional  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI),  which  has \nrecently  accounted  for  as  much  as half  of the  region\u2019s  total  FDI.  Direct  investment  in  plant \nand  equipment  has  created  production  networks  and  supply  chains  in  industries  such  as \nelectronics, automobiles, and other machinery products, that cut across national borders\u2014a \nflipside  of  the  growing  intra-regional  trade.  Japan  has  been  the  center  of  this  increasing \nintra-regional trade, mainly in parts, components, and capital equipment.

(Available: \nkanzei.or.jp/English/index.htm.) \n\n \n\n3.2  Japan\u2019s Industrial Structure \n\nThe  industrial  structure  of  Japan  has  undergone  significant  changes  over  the  past  twenty \nyears. In particular it changed since around 2005 as the real effective exchange rate of the \nyen finally returned to a level more consistent with the long-run average (Figure 8). The yen, \nwhich  had  begun  to  appreciate  in  real  effective  terms  in  early  1985,  peaked  in  1995  when \nthe level was some 80% higher than in 1980. Then the yen began to decline as a trend until \n2007, except for the brief 1999-2001 period when the value rose temporarily.5 \n\n                                                 \n5 When the yen began to appreciate sharply following the Plaza Accord, there was a contraction of manufacturing \nactivity. The Japanese policymakers reacted by expanding both fiscal and monetary policies. Coupled with the \nfavorable terms of trade changes (caused by a fall in energy and commodity prices) at the time, these policy \nactions allowed economic growth to pick up from the fall of 1987 but subsequently led to the emergence of a \nbubble  economy,  with  sharp  rises  in  stock,  real  estate  and  other  asset  prices.  Monetary  policy  then  was \nreversed. \n\nWith  a  bursting  of  the  bubble  economy  in  1991,  the  Japanese  economy  decelerated  and,  in  1992,  entered  a \nprolonged period of stagnation. Annual growth over the next decade averaged less than 1% , compared with \nover 4% during the previous decade. Growth appeared to pick up in 1995-1996, only to fall back. In 1998, in \nthe  midst  of  a  systemic  banking  crisis,  a  severe  recession  set  in  and  the  economy  contracted  in  1998  and \n1999.  The  stagnation  was  compounded  by  sustained  deflationary  pressure;  annual  Consumer  Price  Index \ninflation averaged less than 1% over the \u201clost decade.\u201d Although annual economic growth finally exceeded 2% \nin 2003 and 2004, this moderate recovery did not end the deflation. The corporate goods price level was 13 % \nlower in 2003 than in 1991. \n\nDuring the prolonged period of stagnation, the authorities eased both fiscal and monetary policies substantially to \nsupport domestic demand and to fend off deflationary pressure. The general government balance, which was \nin small surpluses in the early 1990s, deteriorated sharply; it has been in deficit every year since 1993\u2014with \ndeficits exceeding 7% of GDP in virtually every year from 1999 to 2003. As a result, the balance of gross public \ndebt rose from about 70% of GDP in the early 1990s to  over 180% in 2005. As to monetary policy, the BOJ \nlowered the discount rate in several steps from 4.5% in December 1991 to 0.5% in September 1995. With no \nadditional room left to maneuver, in February 1999, it reduced the overnight call rate to virtually zero, a policy it \ncontinued to follow until March 2006, except for the brief period of August 2000\u2013March 2001. A new framework \nof \u201cquantitative easing\u201d\u2014with the de facto \u201czero\u201d policy rate\u2014was adopted in March 2001. \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nFigure 8: Alternative Measures of the Real Effective Exchange Rate of the Yen to the \nUS$ (1980=100) \n\n190\n\n180\n\n170\n\n160\n\n150\n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\nIMF index\n\nBIS index\n\nBOJ index\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics online database; Bank for International Settlements \n\nonline database (available: www.bis.org/statistics/eer); and Bank of Japan online database (available: \n\nwww.boj.or.jp.theme/research/stat/market/forex). \n\nDuring  the  period  of  the  \u201clost  decade,\u201d  the  share  of  the  non-tradable  goods  sector  in  the \nJapanese economy expanded, in a way consistent with the real exchange rate level that was \nhigher than the historical average. From theoretical perspectives, a high real value of the yen \nincreases  the  relative  price  of  non-tradable  goods,  thus  encouraging  their  production; \nresources  therefore  should  shift  away  from  the  production  of  tradable  goods.  This  relative \nprice change, moreover, should reduce the price competitiveness of manufacturing firms that \nproduce  tradable  goods,  so  that  it  also  encourages  them  to  shift  their  production  activities \nabroad through FDI. Indeed, this is what we observed. \n\nFigure 9 depicts the production of non-tradable goods relative to tradable goods from 1980 \nto  2007  in  terms  of  both  nominal  and  real  outputs;  the  two  solid  lines  represent  the \nrespective  trend  lines  (for  our  purposes  here  the  non-tradable  goods  sectors  include \nconstruction, electricity, gas, water, wholesale and retail trade, banking and insurance, real \nestate, transportation, telecommunication, and services; the tradable goods sector includes \nmanufacturing). The figure clearly indicates that the share of the non-tradable goods sector \nrose steadily over this period in terms of nominal value, although the rise in the share of non-\ntradable  goods  was  not  pronounced  when  measured  in  terms  of  real  value  (reflecting  the \nrelatively more rapid growth of non-tradable goods prices). An important point is that, during \nthe period of a strong yen, i.e., 1993\u20132002, the production of non-tradable goods relative to \ntradable goods exceeded the trend, regardless of whether it is measured in nominal or real \nvalue. \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nFigure 9: Production of Nontradable Goods Relative to Tradable Goods (%; 1980=100) \n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\nIn t erms of nominal out put s\nTrend line\n\nIn t erms of real out put s\nTrend line\n\nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates based on Cabinet Office, National Income Accounts. \n\nWhat is more important to observe for our purpose is that, the share of non-tradable goods \nbegan to decline from a peak achieved in 2002. When Japan began slowly to emerge out of \nthe prolonged recession, it relied on the export sector as an engine of growth as the yen fell \nin real effective terms, especially given the limited space for expansionary fiscal policy. As a \nresult,  not  only  did  the  GDP  share  of  exports  increase,  but  also  Japan\u2019s  overall  openness \nrose  from  the  early  2000s  to  2008  when  the  country  was  hit  by  the  global  financial  crisis \n(Table 2). For instance, Japan\u2019s export to GDP ratio, which was 11% in 2000, rose to over \n17% in 2008. Over the same period, trade openness increased from about 20% of GDP to \nalmost 35%. \n\nTable 2: Japan\u2019s Exports, Imports, Net Exports, and Trade Openness (in % of GDP) \n\nExports \n\nImports \n\nNet exports \n\nTrade opennessa \n\n \n1995 \n1996 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n\n9.1 \n9.8 \n10.9 \n10.9 \n10.3 \n11.0 \n10.6 \n11.4 \n12.0 \n13.3 \n14.3 \n16.1 \n17.6 \n17.4 \nNote: a Defined as (exports+imports)/GDP. \n\n7.7\n9.3\n9.8\n9.0\n8.7\n9.5\n9.9\n10.1\n10.4\n11.4\n12.9\n14.9\n15.9\n17.3\n\n1.4\n0.5\n1.1\n1.9\n1.6\n1.5\n0.6\n1.3\n1.6\n1.9\n1.4\n1.3\n1.7\n0.1\n\n16.8\n19.2\n20.6\n19.9\n19.0\n20.5\n20.5\n21.4\n22.4\n24.7\n27.3\n31.0\n33.5\n34.7\n\nSource: Cabinet Office, Government of Japan (available: www.esri.cao.go.jp/jp/sna). \n\nAlthough  net  exports  did  not  show  an  upward  trend  during  this  period,  they  positively \ncontributed to economic growth when there was a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus from 2003 to \n2006 (Table 3). Undoubtedly, the export-led recovery and growth was made possible by the \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nexpansion of the global economy, particularly that of the US economy that followed the post-\nIT  bubble  recession.  The  restructuring  of  the  banking  sector  and  the  resolution  of  bank \nnonperforming  loans  also  likely  supported  the  recovery  process  in  Japan.  This  export-led \ngrowth,  however,  became  increasingly  vulnerable  to  US  economic  turbulence  because  the \nexport  expansion  was  being  fueled  by  an  unsustainable  increase  in  US  personal \nconsumption  backed  by  the  housing  price  bubble,  a  bubble  that  eventually  burst  in  the \nsummer of 2006 and led to the subsequent eruption of the global financial crisis. \n\nTable 3: Contribution to Real GDP Growth (in % annual growth rate) \n\n \n\nReal GDP growth \n\nDomestic demand \n\nNet exports \n\n1995 \n1996 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n\n1.5 \n2.3 \n1.3 \n-2.1 \n-0.3 \n2.7 \n0.2 \n0.3 \n1.7 \n3.1 \n2.3 \n1.8 \n3.5 \n\nPrivate sector \n1.5 \n2.0 \n0.9 \n-2.3 \n-1.2 \n2.3 \n0.7 \n-0.5 \n1.3 \n2.4 \n2.4 \n1.5 \n2.2 \n\nPublic sector \n0.6 \n0.8 \n-0.5 \n-0.1 \n1.1 \n-0.0 \n0.3 \n0.1 \n-0.2 \n-0.1 \n-0.2 \n-0.2 \n0.1 \n\n-0.6 \n-0.5 \n1.0 \n0.3 \n-0.1 \n0.4 \n-0.8 \n0.7 \n0.6 \n0.8 \n0.1 \n0.6 \n1.2 \n\nSource: Cabinet Office, Government of Japan (Available: www.esri.cao.go.jp/jp/sna). \n\n4.  QUANTIFYING THE NATURE OF THE STRUCTURAL \n\nCHANGE \n\nHow  these  changes  in  Japan\u2019s  trade  and  industrial  structures  may  have  affected  the \nresponse of the Japanese economy to global demand shocks can be analyzed by a vector \nautoregression (VAR) technique. VAR is a standard statistical procedure to investigate how \nshocks  are  transmitted  from  one  entity  to  another.  Using  this  statistical  technique,  we \nexamined  the  impact  of  a  shock  that  originates  within  Japan  (a  Japan  shock),  within \nemerging  Asia  (an  emerging  Asia  shock),  and  in  the  rest  of  the  world  (a  global  shock),  in \norder to see how changes in Japan\u2019s economic structure over the past decade or so affected \nthe responsiveness of its GDP to supply or demand shocks originating abroad.6 \n\nFor convenience, we used the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 to divide the sample. We \nthen  used  two  measures  of  the  responsiveness  of  Japanese  GDP  to  global  and  Asian \nshocks.  The  first  measure  is  the  response  to  a  one-standard  deviation  shock  to  the  global \nand  regional  outputs.  The  second  measure  is  the  extent  to  which  the  total  variance  is \nexplained  by  the  variance  of  respective  shocks.  In  order  to  quantify  the  nature  of  the \nstructural change that may have taken place in Japan over the past decade, we compared \nthese  measures  obtained  from  the  pre-crisis  and  post-crisis  samples.  It  should  be  noted, \nhowever,  that  VAR  only  helps  uncover  temporal  statistical  relationships  among  several \nvariables but gives no indication of how and why they affect each other. \n\nConsider  the  following  moving  average  (MA)  representation  of  the  VAR  model,  which \nconsists of three equations representing global, Japanese, and emerging Asian outputs: \n\n                                                 \n6  Takagi  and  Kozuru  (2009)  used  the  same  methodology  and  data  set  to  analyze  the  macroeconomic \n\ninterdependence of Asia. \n\n10 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nXt = \u03a3\u03c61j ut-j  + \u03a3\u03c62j vt-j  + \u03a3\u03c63j wt-j  \n\nYt = \u03a3\u03bb1j ut-j  + \u03a3\u03bb2jvt-j   + \u03a3\u03bb3jwt-j  \n\nZt = \u03a3\u03b71jut-j   + \u03a3\u03b72jvt-j   + \u03a3\u03b73jwt-j   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\nwhere Xt is real GDP in the US and Europe (henceforth referred to as \u201cglobal\u201d), Yt real GDP \nin Japan, and Zt real GDP in emerging Asia, all expressed as indices in order to remove the \ninfluence of nominal exchange rate changes; u, v and w are, respectively, a shock to global \nGDP (a global shock), a shock to Japanese GDP (a Japan shock), and a shock to emerging \nAsia\u2019s  GDP  (an  emerging  Asia  shock).  We  are  particularly  interested  in  examining  the \npattern  of  response  of  Japanese  GDP  (Y)  to  the  past  global  and  emerging  Asia  shocks, \nbefore and after the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. \n\nThe  simplified  setup  of  equations  (1)\u2013(3)  is  dictated  by  the  small  number  of  observations, \nespecially  when  the  data  are  divided  into  the  pre-Asian  crisis  and  the  post-Asian  crisis \nperiod. Even with this simple setup, various data limitations have restricted the coverage of \ncountries  as  well  as  the  choice  of  sample.7  The  results  reported  below  are  based  on  the \nassumptions  that  in  the  long  run  global  GDP  affects  both  Japanese  and  emerging  Asian \nGDPs; Japanese GDP affects only emerging Asian GDP; and emerging Asian GDP affects \nneither. In the short run, all the GDPs affect each other. We have verified, however, that the \nsubstantive  results  are  robust  to  the  choice  of  ordering.  Lag  length  is  determined  by  the \nAkaike  Information  Criterion  (AIC).  The  pre-crisis  period  refers  to  Q1:1988\u2013Q4:1996,  while \nthe post-crisis period covers Q1:1999\u2013Q4:2006. \n\nFigure  10  shows  the  responses  of  Japanese  GDP  to  a  one-standard  deviation  shock  to \nglobal, Japan, and emerging Asia GDP. Before the Asian financial crisis of 1997, Japanese \nGDP  did  not  respond  significantly  to  a  global  shock  (in  each  graph,  the  red  dotted  lines \nindicate  a  confidence  interval).  In  the  post-  crisis  period,  however,  Japan\u2019s  output  became \nsignificantly  responsive  to  a  global  shock,  while  the  response  to  its  own  shock  declined \nsignificantly.  There  was  little  change  in  the  responsiveness  to  an  emerging  Asia  shock \nacross the two samples. \n\n                                                 \n7 The  sample  countries  include:  (i)  for  Asia,  in  addition  to  Japan;  PRC;  Hong  Kong,  China;  India;  Indonesia; \nKorea; Malaysia, Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand; and (ii) for the rest of the world, Belgium, \nFrance, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the US, and the United Kingdom. Global and regional GDPs \n(or prices) are the weighted averages of the individual country GDPs (or prices) in the respective regions, with \n2000  US$-GDPs  used  as  the  weights.

Before  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of \n1997-1998,  virtually  100%  of  the  variance  of  Japanese  GDP  was  explained  by  a  Japan \nshock  alone.  Global  and  emerging  Asia  shocks  had  no  role.  In  the  post-crisis  period, \nhowever,  the  portion  explainable  by  a  global  shock  increased  significantly  (to  about  40% \nafter  a  few  quarters),  with  little  change  observed  for  the  emerging  Asia  shock.  Consistent \nwith the impulse response analysis reported above, global GDP shocks tend to have a much \nmore  significant  impact  on  Japanese  GDP  in  recent  years.  As  a  result,  the  variance  of \nJapanese GDP can be explained almost equally by Japan and global shocks. \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nFigure 11: Variance Decomposition of Japanese GDP: \nComparing the Pre- and Post-Asian Financial Crisis Periods \n\nGlobal Shock\n\nAsia Shock\n\nVariance Decomposition of Japan GDP\n\npre-crisis\n\nJapan Shock\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14 16\n\n18\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12 14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10 12\n\n14 16 18\n\nGlobal Shock\n\nAsia Shock\n\npost-crisis\n\nJapan Shock\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10 12\n\n14 16\n\n18\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12 14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10 12\n\n14 16 18\n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n5.  CONCLUSION \n\nJapan was hit hard by the global financial crisis even though its relatively resilient financial \nsystem  initially  limited  the  direct  impact.  The  severe  collapse  of  industrial  production  that \nfollowed  was  no  doubt  attributable  to  a  confluence  of  factors,  including  the  stock  price \ndeclines that eroded the capital base of commercial banks and thus limited their willingness \nto lend as well as the lagged impact of the sharp rise in oil and other commodity prices in the \nsummer  of  2008.  As  a  primary  cause  of  the  severe  recession,  however,  this  paper  has \nhighlighted the impact that came from the contractionary effect of global deleveraging on the \nreal  economy.  In  this  environment,  Japan  was  particularly  vulnerable  because  of  the \nstructural  changes  that  had  taken  place  over  the  past  decade  in  its  trade  and  industrial \nstructures.  VAR  analysis  has  confirmed  that,  as  a  result  of  these  structural  changes, \nJapanese output became much more responsive to output shocks in the advanced markets \nof the US and Western Europe. \n\nJapan\u2019s  structural  changes  had  two  components.  First,  over  90%  of  Japan\u2019s  exports \nconsisted of highly income-elastic industrial supplies, capital goods, and consumer durables. \nThough  emerging  Asia  is  Japan\u2019s  largest  export  market,  the  region\u2019s  imports  from  Japan \nlargely consist of industrial supplies and capital goods that are necessary at least in part for \nthe  production  of  final  consumer  goods  destined  for  the  advanced  markets  of  the  US  and \nWestern  Europe.  Asia\u2019s  intra-regional  trade  had  expanded  rapidly  until  the  outbreak  of  the \nglobal financial crisis, with Japan as the most important supplier of foreign direct investment \nand  technology  intensive  products,  but  much  of  it  had  been  in  the  trade  of  parts, \ncomponents, and capital equipment. With final demand coming from the developed markets \noutside  the  region,  the  demand  contraction  in  these  developed  economies  due  to  global \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\ndeleveraging  had  direct  and  secondary  impacts  on  Japan\u2014and  other  similar  emerging \neconomies like Korea, Singapore and Taipei,China. \n\nSecond, Japan\u2019s trade dependence had increased since the early 2000s, as evidenced by a \nrising export to GDP ratio and a declining share of the non-tradable sector. This was induced \nby  the  return  of  the  real  effective  exchange  rate  of  the  yen  to  a  level more  in  line  with  the \nlong-run  average,  allowing  the  Japanese  economy  to  finally  come  out  of  a  decade-long \nstagnation. Fundamentally, increasing trade openness can be thought of as a natural part of \nthe  process  of  economic  globalization  and  regional  integration  that  has  been  advancing \nthroughout the world and especially in Asia. But the manner in which this process played out \nmade Japan particularly vulnerable to a large output shock coming from outside.  \n\nIn  looking  to  the  future,  one  must  make  a  distinction  between  the  outcome  of  the  natural \nprocess of economic globalization and integration, of which Japan has been a part, and the \nneed to manage that process. As Japan continues to integrate with the regional and global \neconomies, as it should, a rise in the ratio of exports to GDP is likely to continue; a share of \nemerging  Asia  in  Japan\u2019s  total  exports  may  well  continue  to  increase,  especially  as  the \nregion\u2019s income levels rise. What matters is the geographical and product diversification of \nthe  likely  increases  in  exports.  To  make  Japan  more  resilient  to  external  shocks, \npolicymakers could create enabling environments to stimulate the export of finished goods to \nemerging  Asia,  for  example,  through  the  establishment  of  a  region-wide  free  trade \narrangement. In this context, it is instructive to note the experience of Germany during the \ncurrent  crisis.  Although  Japan  and  Germany  share  similar  industrial  structures,  German \nindustrial production did not decline as much despite the fact that its export dependence was \neven greater than that of Japan.8 \n\nDomestically, there is no rational ground where one can advocate a policy of reducing trade \nopenness  just  to  minimize  vulnerability  to  external  shocks.  Japan,  as  a  relatively  large \neconomy,  however,  cannot  rely  on  external  demand  alone  to  sustain  its  economic  growth \nover  the  medium-term.  To  the  extent  that  there  are  impediments  that  may  inhibit  the \nvigorous expansion of domestic demand or the non-tradable goods sector, policy needs to \naddress  them.  To  promote  domestic  demand,  the  social  sector  protection  system  (for \neducation, health, unemployment, and pensions) needs to be substantially reformed so as to \nreduce  households\u2019  uncertainty  for  the  future.  To  promote  a  better  allocation  of  resources \nbetween the more regulated non-tradable goods sector (such as medical, health, and young- \nand  old-age  caretaking)  and  the  less  regulated  tradable  goods  sector,  further  deregulatory \nmeasures  are  called  for.  A  substantial  lifting  of  restrictions  in  agriculture,  especially  the \nliberal \ncorporatization  of  agricultural  production,  would  be  especially  helpful.  More \nimmigration  policy  should  help  invigorate  private  investment  in  an  aging  society.  With  little \navailable fiscal space, these and other measures will help create a climate in which private \ninvestment can flourish, driven by final domestic demand. \n\n                                                 \n8 German  industrial  production  did  not  decline  noticeably  during  the  last  quarter  of  2008;  even  during  the  first \nquarter of 2009, the decline was around 20% from a year earlier\u2014significantly less than Japan\u2019s decline(IMF, \nInternational Financial Statistics online database). \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 153 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nKawai and Takagi \n\nBank for International Settlements (BIS). 2009.

The  severe  collapse  of  industrial  production  that \nfollowed  was  no  doubt  attributable  to  a  confluence  of  factors,  but  the  paper  highlights  the \nimpact that came from the contractionary effect of global deleveraging on the real economy. \nIn this environment, Japan was particularly vulnerable because of the structural changes that \nhad  taken  place  over  the  past  decade  in  its  trade  and  industrial  structures.  Vector \nautoregression  analysis  confirms  that,  as  a  result  of  these  structural  changes,  Japanese \noutput  became  much  more  responsive  to  output  shocks  in  the  advanced  markets  of  the \nUnited States and Western Europe. \n", "The structural changes had two components.
