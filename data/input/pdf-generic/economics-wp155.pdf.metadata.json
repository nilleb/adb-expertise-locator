However, the process of identifying the \ncombination of questions that could distinguish between formal and informal \nworkers was hampered by data inconsistencies that were probably brought about \nby limitations in data processing and validation. Because 3 years have already \npassed since data processing was done, the most workable approach was to \ndetermine which workers are under formal employment, and to assume that the \nremaining workers are engaged informally. \nResults show that 87.71% of the workers in Bangladesh are under informal \nemployment. The highest concentration of informal workers is found in the rural \nareas (92%). Workers engaged in informal employment are mostly in agriculture; \nhunting and forestry; wholesale and retail trade; manufacturing; and transport, \nstorage, and communications sectors. On the other hand, formal workers are \nprimarily employed by the government. Women (91.3%) are most likely to be \nengaged in informal employment than men (86.6%); and women are generally \nunpaid family workers and in the private household sector. Workers under formal \nemployment are paid better than those under informal arrangements. For each \nsector, wage differentials between formal and informal workers are significant. \nInformal workers are found to have significantly less benefits than those with \nformal employment, except for free meals and free lodging. In particular, self-\nemployed and unpaid workers comprise a little over 20 million of informal \nworkers, although less than 2 million of them enjoy benefits.", "", "I. Introduction\nEven though there has been significant poverty reduction in Asia, the 2008 International \nLabour Organization (ILO) Employment Trends indirectly estimated, using modeling \ntechniques and available survey data from countries, some 487 million workers, 300 \nmillion of whom live in Asia, who do not earn enough to lift themselves and their families \nabove the US$1/day poverty line (ILO 2008). This ILO report also determined that five out \nof 10 people in the world are in vulnerable employment, being either contributing family \nworkers or own-account workers with a higher risk of being unprotected. These statistics \npresented a compelling reason for the inclusion of another target in the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals just 7 years before the target year\u2014achieving full and productive \nemployment and decent work for all, including women and young people. To achieve \nthis target, countries have to consider a shift to a worker-centered approach to poverty \nreduction and economic development.\nEmployment is still considered the most reliable vehicle to take the poor out of poverty. \nHowever, the very little available evidence from surveys across the world suggests that \nmost of the working poor are engaged in informal employment, which does not usually \noffer adequate wages, good working conditions, and social protection. Available evidence \nsuggests that only the informal employers who hire others can rise above the poverty \nthreshold (Chen 2006). It is therefore necessary that efforts to alleviate poverty must be \nfocused on the needs and constraints faced by the poor who are engaged in informal \nemployment.\nHow can governments and the development community help the working poor in the \ninformal sector to move out of poverty? Decent work for the working poor should be \npromoted as a mechanism to reduce poverty. More and better employment opportunities \nmust be created and efforts to influence the informal enterprises to register and extend \nbenefits to their workers must be amplified.\nSuch reorientation of economic policies may not be possible, however, unless data on \nthose engaged in the informal sector and in informal employment outside the informal \nsector are available for economic analysis. More information on wage differentials, ", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 155\nworking conditions, social protection, and other issues are needed by policymakers and \nthe development community to make well-informed decisions.  \nAt present, very few countries in Asia regularly collect data on informal employment and \nthe informal sector, which ironically is perceived to be prevalent in many developing \ncountries in Asia. In Bangladesh, for example, the informal sector is roughly estimated to \ncontribute about 64% of total gross domestic product (GDP). This rough approximation \nwas arrived at by applying many assumptions on the composition of various national \naccounts sectors on existing survey data. The surveys that were used, however, were \nnot really conducted for purposes of studying the informal sector, hence the difficulty of \nmaking the standard definitions of informal sector and informal employment operational.\nThis analyzes informal employment in Bangladesh by utilizing the most recent Labor \nForce Survey (LFS) that was conducted in 2005. Although this survey was not designed \nto collect data on informal employment, it included questions that can be used to \ndetermine whether workers are engaged in formal or informal employment. However, \nfor those own-account workers and self-employed that can be considered household \nunincorporated enterprises with at least some market production (HUEMs), there are \nno questions in LFS that would provide more insights on the HUEM\u2019s expenditure, \nproduction, capital, and other infrastructure characteristics. Hence, the study was limited \nonly to the comparative analysis of wages, working conditions, and benefits between \nworkers engaged in formal and informal employment. In so doing, the study also explored \npossible ways in which the LFS questionnaire can be improved and expanded for future \nsurvey rounds so that it could be effectively utilized in analyzing the links between \nemployment and poverty and also in the construction of a sampling frame for HUEM \nsurveys.1\nII. Analytical Framework\nIn studying informal employment, it is important to understand the official international \nstandard definition first. In 1993, the International Conference of Labour Statisticians \n(ICLS) adopted an international statistical definition of the \u201cinformal sector\u201d to refer to \nemployment and production that takes place in small and/or unregistered enterprises. In \n2003, the 17th ICLS broadened the definition to include certain types of informal wage \nemployment, employment outside informal enterprises. This larger concept is referred \nto as informal employment. According to the 17th ICLS, \u201cemployees are considered to \nhave informal jobs if their employment relationship is, in law or in practice, not subject to \nlabour legislation, income taxation, social protection or entitlement to certain employment \n\u0004  This is the most cost effective approach for collecting data on the informal sector  since it does not require a more \ncomprehensive listing operation of all informal sector production units, which are very difficult to identify in the \nfield and hence, also very costly to construct.", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 3\nbenefits (advance notice of dismissal, severances of pay, paid annual or sick leave, etc.)\u201d. \nNote that this definition is made on the job level and not at the individual level because a \nperson can simultaneously have two or more jobs.  \nInformal employment can be classified into two: informal self employment and informal \nwage employment. Under informal self employment are employers in informal enterprises; \nown-account workers in informal enterprises; unpaid family workers, and members of \ninformal producers\u2019 cooperatives (Chen 2006). Informal wage employment includes \nemployees without formal contracts, worker benefits, or social protection and are \nemployed either in formal or informal enterprises.2\nThe dichotomy discussed above suggests that informal employment cuts across \nall employment status categories: employers, employees, own-account workers, \nunpaid family workers, and members of producers\u2019 cooperatives (Hussmanns 2004).  \nEmployment status is critical in understanding the link between informality and poverty.  \nThe United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the global network \nWomen in Informal Economy: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) came up with \nmeasurement techniques for measuring the risk of poverty among employed persons \nin different employment statuses. These studies found that informal agricultural workers \nhave the highest risk of poverty while informal employers are the least susceptible to \npoverty among nonagricultural workers. These results suggest that the link between \ninformal employment and poverty is discernible only when informal workers are classified \nby employment status and industry/trade (or national accounts) sectors.  \nThe country studies discussed above also support the segmentation of informal \nemployment, as shown in Figure 1. The segmented \u201ciceberg\u201d in Figure 1 (Chen 2004) \nrepresents the hierarchy of the classes of workers in informal employment according to \ntheir relative visibility. The employers, who are the most visible among workers in the \ninformal sector, are at the tip and those home workers who are usually neglected in policy \nmaking and monitoring are at the bottom. A modification of this iceberg will be introduced \nin the succeeding section such that the iceberg will also represent the hierarchy \nof average earnings across the different segments with the height of the segment \nrepresenting the mean wage or earnings. The employers at the top of the visibility iceberg \nalso have the highest earnings. On the other hand, the home workers at the base of the \npyramid have the lowest average wages. Self-employed or own-account workers and \nother types of workers are placed in between.  \n2  Informal enterprises are household enterprises engaged in the production of goods or services with the primary \nobjective of generating employment and incomes to the persons concerned; which typically operate at a low \nlevel of organization, with little or no division between labor and capital as factors of production, and on a small \nscale. Labor relations\u2014where they exist\u2014are based mostly on casual employment, kinship, or personal and social \nrelations rather than contractual arrangements with formal guarantees.

However, the average wages across employment status \nand by industry/trade could be analyzed to explore the links of informality and poverty. \nOther studies also suggest that there are more women workers in the informal sector \nwho are poor (ILO 2002). There is also a significant gap in wages between men and \nwomen as reflected in prior research. This result can be verified by comparing the wage \ndifferentials of men and women across national accounts sector and employment status.\nWorkers, whether those in the formal or informal sector, encounter the same family/\npersonal issues that often undermine their well-being and livelihood: illness, property loss, \ndisability, old age, and death. But because of the very nature of informal employment, \ninformal workers do not enjoy the same social protection mechanisms that come with \nformal employment. Also, in general, informal workers do not have job security and \nreceived very little benefits from employers. To validate these perceptions, comparative \nanalysis of wages, benefits, and working conditions between formal/informal workers \nby employment status can be undertaken. These results will be informative on the risks \nfaced by informal workers and could also become the basis for designing appropriate \nsocial and legal protections for the informal workforce.\nThe analysis described above is performed on Bangladesh\u2019s 2005 LFS, although the \nquestionnaire itself (see Appendix 1) and sample questionnaire were not designed to \ncapture informal employment or informal sector data. In particular, the set of questions \nas recommended by the United Nations Interregional Cooperation on the Measurement ", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 5\nof Informal Sector and Informal Employment3 (see Appendix 2) to screen for informal \nemployment or any other equivalent set was not applied. However, there are some \nquestions that were not specifically formulated for this purpose but could be used for \nidentifying informal workers. Hence, the internationally accepted concepts of informal \nemployment and employment status are applied despite these limitations. This process \nwill identify the pitfalls in the current questionnaire design that should be minimized in the \nnext LFS round. The pitfalls are documented and resolution of which are formulated as \ninputs to the questionnaire design for the next LFS. Moreover, as an additional output of \nthe data analysis, the issues that were encountered in analyzing the data, such as out of \ncategory responses and other data validation issues, are identified and utilized. \nIII. Methodology\nThe first step in the implementing the analytical framework described above on the \n2005 LFS was to identify the employed and unemployed population by applying the ILO \ndefinition. The questions from the LFS questionnaire that could be used to apply the \nILO concept of employment were used to filter the appropriate respondents and properly \nclassify them. It is critical to correctly distinguish those included and not included in the \nlabor force, since the survey included all adult respondents in the sample household. \nMoreover, these estimates will be the basis of further examination of the dataset, thus, \nshould coincide with the estimates published by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics \n(BBS). \nThe queries used to determine the labor force are the ones pertaining to having work/job \nand those concerned about the actions taken to look for a job, specifically, Questions (Q) \n4.1, 4.2, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5 (see Appendix 1). The decision matrix in classifying whether \none is employed or unemployed is presented in Table 1. \n\u0004  The Interregional Cooperation on the Measurement of Informal Sector and Informal Employment is a multiyear \nand multilateral development account project of the United Nations, with the Economic and Social Commission \nfor the Asia and Pacific as the lead agency, whose main objectives are to increase the availability of data on the \ninformal sector and informal employment, and to improve the calculation of the contribution of informal sector to \nemployment and to gross domestic product.", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 155\nTable 1: Decision Matrix for Identifying the Employed and Unemployed Persons\nEmployment  Combination of Answers to Identify Employed and Unemployed Persons\nStatus \nQ4.1 Any  Q4.2 Any  Q8.2 Tried to  Q8.3 Step taken  Q8.5 Reasons \neconomic  economic  find a job during  to get a job for not looking \nactivity during  activity?  the last week? for a job\nthe last week?

Using the 15th  and 17th ICLS definitions of the informal sector and informal \nemployment, respectively, as the standard concepts, the 2005 LFS questionnaire was \nexamined to identify the questions that may be used for determining informal employment \ninside and outside the informal sector.

To resolve this incompatibility, \nthe first two or three digits of the code in the data file were interpreted using the codes \nin the data dictionary. Using this methodology, cross tabulations of Q4.6 against Q4.12 \nand Q4.13 were performed. The results, however, revealed mixed generalizations, some \nacceptable, others questionable. \nTo illustrate, the respondents classified as legislators and senior officials (using the 3-\ndigit codes are identified as legislators, senior government officials, traditional chiefs and \nheads of villages, senior officials of special interest) only answered government, private \nformal sector, and others, as their sectors of employments. There were no respondents \nfrom the personal household and personal establishments sectors. Moreover, among the \n10 selections of employment status, only two were chosen by these respondents, namely, \nregular paid employee and self-employed. These outcomes are reasonable, thus verifying \nthe notion that the process implemented was acceptable. Still, further analysis resulted to \nsome debatable conclusions such as:\n(i)  Physical and engineering science associate, Life science and health associate \nprofessionals, Teaching associate professionals, and the like, classified as unpaid \nfamily worker and domestic worker (maid servant)\n(ii)  Teaching professionals and Office clerks falling under the day labor (agriculture)                              \nemployment status", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 9\n(iii)  Subsistence agricultural and fishery workers and Agricultural, fishery, and related \nlaborers identified as working in the government sector.\nThe risk of incorrectly classifying the respondents by main task consequently led to \nthe decision of dropping Q4.6 from the questions considered.

The former could arise because questions and response choices \nmay not have been properly formulated on the basis of standard definitions/concepts.  \nFor example, in Q4.12 (Status of Employment), there is a choice item that corresponds to \n\u201cpaid/unpaid apprentices\u201d, a compound choice that is difficult to decompose. It is difficult \nto assess this type of worker since it can be interpreted as a paid (by wage) assistant, \nunpaid on the job training assistant without allowance, or unpaid intern with allowance. \nBasically, the \u201cpaid\u201d and \u201cunpaid\u201d workers are deemed to belong in different categories, \nand should not be classified together. However, it is also possible that the \u201cpaid\u201d and \n\u201cunpaid\u201d terms refer to \u201callowances\u201d and not to wage payment, thus, this particular \ngrouping. This ambiguity, with a more than one possible interpretation for the particular \noption, can confuse the respondent and introduce uncertainty in the analysis.\nAnother example would be choice number \u201c2\u201d in Q 4.13 (Sector of Work) corresponding \nto private formal sector. It is unclear how the private formal sector is defined, since \nwhen cross tabulated with Q4.21 (Registration/Recommendation) and Q4.22 (Written \nAccounts), the outcomes are contradictory. From the term \u201cformal\u201d sector in the choice \ntitle, it is expected that the responses of those who identified themselves working in this \nsector would be \u201cyes\u201d in both questions. However, of the number4 who answered, 41% \n(based on unweighted number of respondents), replied \u201cno\u201d to Q4.21, while 44% (based \non unweighted number of respondents) said that the establishment they work for do not \nkeep written accounts of its transactions. Therefore, either the private formal sector does \nnot coincide with the ILO description of the formal sector, meaning, it is defined differently \nin the Bangladesh LFS, or the term \u201cformal\u201d in this case was inappropriately applied to \nchoice 2. \nOn the other hand, there could also be inconsistencies arising from the enumeration \nprocess, when skipping patterns were not properly observed.  As described in Table \n5, even though Q4.15 to Q4.20 (six items) were identified in the questionnaire to be \nqueries for Paid/Salary Based workers only, there were still some employers, self-\nemployed, and unpaid family workers who answered one or more of the six questions. \nSimilarly, while Q4.21 and Q4.22 were exclusive to self-employed, employers, and unpaid \nfamily members, there were regular paid workers, irregular paid workers, day laborers \n(agriculture and nonagriculture), domestic workers, and paid/unpaid apprentices who \nreplied to the queries. Moreover, a number of unpaid family workers provided information \non the amount of wage they received (Q4.18 and Q4.19) and the manner  \n(Q4.17) by which they were paid. These results are also indicative of a survey preparation \ntraining and data validation system that still have a large room for improvement. \n4  The nonresponse is not considered.", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 11\nIn light of these inconsistencies and data limitations, identifying the informal workers \nbecame a difficult procedure. For example, there were respondents that said they \nare unpaid family workers or domestic workers but then they also either work in the \ngovernment, or are paid monthly/weekly, or are working in establishments with written \naccounts and are registered with the proper authorities (see Table 5). Also, with the \nexistence of the vague choice selections, a substantial number of missing data was \nrecorded in the dataset. This situation resulted to inconclusive classification of workers, \nsince respondents would fall under neither the formal nor informal categories because \nsome conditions were not satisfied. Most of these respondents were regular paid \nemployees who provided no answers on the mode of payment and those employers \nand/or self-employed who neither answered \u201cyes\u201d nor \u201cno\u201d to the questions on availability \nof written accounts of business and/or registration of establishments. These respondents \nare distributed across all sectors of employment. Lastly, because of the option \u201cothers\u201d in \nQ4.12 and Q4.13, two of the key questions used to determine the type of employment, \na clear-cut description of some workers became impossible. Hence, with the available \nLFS dataset and through a series of analysis, the process of setting criteria for identifying \nformal employment was deemed more practical than determining informal employment \nbased on the informal employment definition and criteria. A mix of enterprise and \nemployment-based criteria were used. Results of the cross tabulations on the listed \n(eight) queries showed that the items significant or useful for identifying formal sector \nemployment using the 2005 LFS are the following: \n(i)  employment status (Q4.12)\n(ii)  sector of work (Q4.13)\n(iii)  mode of payment (Q4.17)\n(iv)  registration of business (Q4.21)\n(v)  availability of written accounts of business (Q4.22) \nThe conditions set in identifying formal employment are presented in Table 6.", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 155\nTable 6: Decision Matrix for Identifying Formal Sector Employment\nCriteria Q4.12 Employment  Q4.13 Sector of  Q4.17 Mode  Q4.22  Q4.21 \nStatus Employment of Payment Written  Registration\nAccounts\nFormal  \u0004 - Regular paid  \u0004 - Government   & 2 - Weekly     \nEmployment employee                 & 2 - Private formal sector \u0004 - Monthly\n2 - Employer            & \u0004 - Government   & \u0004 - yes\n2 - Private formal sector\n\u0004 - Self-employed    & \u0004 - Government   & \u0004 - yes\n2 - Private formal sector\n\u00040 - Other                & \u0004 - Government   & \u0004 - yes\n2 - Private formal sector\n2 - Employer            & 4 - Personal establishment   & \u0004 - yes & \u0004 - yes\n5 - Other\n\u0004 - Self-employed    & 4 - Personal establishment    & \u0004 - yes & \u0004 - yes\n5 - Other\n\u00040 - Other                & 4 - Personal establishment    & \u0004 - yes & \u0004 - yes\n5 - Other\nIn this matrix, the chief factors considered in defining formal workers are:\n(i)  For regular paid employees: Their sector of employment and the mode of payment \nby which wages are received.\n(ii)  For employers and self employed workers, as well as those that fall under the \n\u201cothers\u201d category, working in either the government or private formal sector: The \nexistence of written accounts of their businesses and/or whether the business is \nregistered with the proper authorities.\n(iii)  For employers and self employed workers, as well as those that fall under the \n\u201cothers\u201d category, working in either private establishments or \u201cother\u201d sector: The \nexistence of written accounts of their businesses and/or whether the business is \nregistered with the proper authorities. \nThe respondents who were not able to satisfy these conditions were classified as informal \nworkers. With this approach, the informal workers were surmised to be: \n(i)  All those who identified themselves to be unpaid family workers, irregular paid \nworkers, day laborers in agriculture, day laborers in nonagriculture, domestic \nworkers, and paid/unpaid apprentices\n(ii)  All workers employed in the personal household sector\n(iii)  Paid employees working in the government or private formal sector and are NOT \npaid weekly or monthly", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 13\n(iv)  Paid employees working in personal establishments and \u201cothers\u201d sectors \n(v)  Employers, self employed workers, and \u201cother\u201d workers employed in businesses \nwith NO written accounts and/or are NOT registered with the proper authorities\nUsing this classification, estimates of formal and informal employment in Bangladesh \nbased on the 2005 LFS are summarized in Table 7 below.\nTable 7: Formal and Informal Employment Estimates, 2005\u20132006\nVariable Estimate\nFormal Employment 5,8\u00048,582\nInformal Employment 4\u0004,5\u00048,009\nTotal Employment 47,\u000456,59\u0004\nAs defined in Section II, there are five categories of employment status, namely:  \n(i) own-account workers; (ii) employers; (iii) unpaid family workers; (iv) employees; and  \n(v) members of producers\u2019 cooperatives (Hussmanns 2004). Meanwhile Chen et al. \n(2006) have noted that there are both formal and informal employees as well as informal \nwage workers. Informal employees and wage workers do not have formal contracts, \nworker benefits, or social protection and may be employed by formal or informal \nenterprises/employers or by households. With the data limitations described above, these \ncategories were applied to the 2005 LFS with the following resulting employment classes:\n(i)  Employees: composed of regular paid employees\n(ii)  Employers: composed of employers\n(iii)  Own-account workers: composed of self-employed\n(iv)  Unpaid workers: composed of unpaid family workers\n(v)  Wage workers: composed of irregular paid workers, day laborers in agriculture, \nday laborers in nonagriculture, domestic workers, and paid/unpaid apprentices\nHence, in addition to the analysis of Bangladesh\u2019s employed population by sector in the \nnational accounts, the study also investigated the formal and informal employment by this \nrevised employment status classification. These classifications and analysis approach is \nthen used to examine the wage differentials between the formal and informal workers.  \nIn computing for the wage differentials, Q4.18 and Q4.19 of the 2005\u201306 LFS \nquestionnaire were considered, i.e., by combining the responses in the two questions, the \ntotal wage per respondent was estimated. Meanwhile, analysis of wage differentials was ", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 155\nconducted by computing for the mean wage of formal and informal workers by class of \nworker and by industry as classified in the national accounts. \nHowever, it must be mentioned that Q4.18 and Q4.19 are applied only to those \nrespondents who identified themselves to be paid or salary workers or, by class of \nworker, those categorized as employees and wage workers. But, as in other cases, the \nskipping pattern for this set of questions was also not followed; employers and own \naccount workers also provided answers. Working on this type of dataset, one needs \nto make adjustments in data analysis and maximize the use of information available. \nThus, though the earnings data of the employers and own account workers may just be \nproducts of nonimplementation of (or wrong) skipping patterns, these were still utilized \nfor the wage analysis as no other questions pertaining to income were inquired from the \nworkers who are not paid/salary based. \nHowever, before this decision was reached, various hypotheses on the reasons behind \nthese wage results were presented and discussed. To reiterate, the primary assumption \nis that the skipping pattern was not followed. Another notion is that the questions \nthemselves were placed in the wrong section and they were intended for all types of \nworkers, hence, they were answered by all possible respondents. Justification for this \nassumption is the use of the term \u201cearn\u201d in the questions, instead of \u201cwage\u201d or \u201csalary\u201d, \nwhich may be applicable to all types of workers. Moreover, of the total employer \nrespondents, 40% or 57 out of the total 184 (unweighted), answered the question. On \nthe other hand, a lower 5.5% (1,576 unweighted) of the total self-employed respondents \nprovided responses on their earnings, which still produced usable data. With the lack of \ninformation, however, no definite conclusion may be reached; and due to the significant \nneed for wage/earnings analysis, the total earnings of the employers and own account \nworkers were also gathered from Q4.18 and Q4.19. \nIn connection to the preceding discussion and in line with the irregularities observed in \nthe dataset, the unpaid family workers also provided answers to questions pertaining to \nwage/earnings. Aside from the fact that no monetary payments should be received by this \nclass by virtue of its definition as unpaid, respondents answered Q4.18 and Q4.19 which, \nas mentioned before, are questions intended for the paid/salary workers. The noticeable \nnumber of these respondents\u2014185,826 (weighted) and 253 (unweighted) or 1.8% of \ntotal unpaid workers\u2014warranted more investigation of the wage data and the associated \nerrors. A possible justification for this case is that estimates were computed from the total \nmonetary value of the \u201cin kind\u201d payment. This idea, however, did not hold much ground \nsince only one respondent, in each of the questions, provided answers for the \u201cin kind\u201d \nanswer choice. In effect, the data shows that all respondents supplied answers to the \u201cin \ncash\u201d item. On the other hand, the notion cannot be completely excluded because given \nthe data inconsistencies, it is plausible that misinterpretation of answer choices might \nhave also occurred. Unfortunately, we are only confined to make speculations because of \nour limited ability to confirm or validate most of the assumptions.  ", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 15\nResults like these imply problems from data gathering to validation until data processing. \nHowever, due to lack of data and because of the conspicuous number of respondents \nanswering questions, it is difficult to ignore these results. Therefore, some of these wage \ninformation, though dubiously collected, were still incorporated in the analysis. \nIt should also be noted that the 2005 LFS utilized a two-stage stratified cluster sampling \ndesign called the Integrated Multi Purpose Sample (IMPS) in selecting the sample \nhouseholds and individuals. Clusters of about 200 households each were formed as \nenumeration blocks for each zila (municipality) on the basis of the 2001 Census of \nPopulation. These enumeration blocks served as the primary sampling units (PSUs) \nin IMPS and were classified as urban, rural, and statistical metropolitan areas (SMA).  \nFurther geographical stratification was also introduced by classifying the zila according \nto six divisions: Barisabal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet.  In all, there \nwere 129 strata formed: 64 strata corresponding to 64 rural zila; 61 strata classified under \nurban with the other three, Gazipur, Narayanganj, and Khulna taken together to form one \nstratum under SMA; and three other SMA strata formed from urban areas with very large \npopulation, namely Dhaka, Chittagong, and Rajshahi. \nThe correct survey weights are critical in getting unbiased estimates from the probability \nsample survey.  However, Maligalig and Barcenas (2008) found that the survey weights \nin this LFS round was derived as the ratio of total households in the strata (updated \nas of April 2006) to the sample households instead of the product of the base weight \n(the inverse of the selection probability) and the adjustments for nonresponse and \nnoncoverage. Because measure of sizes and selection probabilities that were used \nwhen the sample households were selected are not available anymore, the comparative \nanalyses performed and reported in the next section were based on the survey weights \nspecified in IMPS.  As shown in Maligalig and Barcenas, the use of these incorrect \nweights would usually lead to biased estimates.  However, since the correct survey \nweights could not be constructed anymore, the only available recourse had to be taken.\nIn addition to incorrect survey weights, Maligalig and Barcenas (2008) also identified the \nfollowing issues that were critical to the successful implementation of the LFS survey \ndesign: \n(i)  The domain was not specified in IMPS and as a consequence, the sample size \nwas not determined following the standard practice. The results, therefore, of the \n2005 LFS were limited to the national level and big groups of the population.  \n(ii)  The number of PSUs and the number of households to be sampled within a \nPSU were determined subjectively without the benefit of analysis. Selecting 40 \nhouseholds from a PSU with an average size of 200 is not usually practiced since \nhouseholds in a cluster are likely to have similar socioeconomic characteristics.", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 155\n(iii)  Sample allocation across strata was subjectively implemented causing inequitable \nallocation. Stratification measures and sample allocation across strata have to be \nreviewed to improve the efficiency of estimates.  \nTo make the comparative analysis of wages received by the formal and informal workers \nmore critical and informative, the mean wages of workers were examined in the following \nmanner:\n(i)  by formal and informal categories (all employed workers) to establish the general \nidea of the wage discrepancy between the two sectors\n(ii)  by class5 of workers to identify which class receives the lowest and the highest \naverage wages, and to measure the wage gap between the formal and informal \nworkers\n(iii)  by national accounts industry classification to determine which sector provides the \nlowest and highest mean wages, as well as to identify which industry posts the \nwidest formal\u2013informal wage differential\nIt was mentioned earlier that workers in informal employment have very limited assurance \nof regular work while receiving very few benefits. To verify this notion, the estimated \nformal and informal workers, by class of workers, were cross tabulated with Q4.20, \n\u201c What benefits are provided other than wages and salaries by employer?\u201d This item \nprovides 12 choices namely: (1) paid holdings or paid leave (including wages and \nsalaries); (2) paid sick leave; (3) bonus; (4) working dress (free of cost); (5) free meals; \n(6) subsidized meals; (7) free transport; (8) telephone facilities; (9) free lodging; (10) \nsubsidized lodging; (11) others; and (12) no facility is given. The respondents were \nallowed more than one answer, up to a maximum of six. \nLike in the preceding cases of ambiguity in choice selection (i.e., choice 9 in Q4.12) \noption 12 in this item seems to provide variety of interpretations. One may assume that \nit means that the worker receives no benefits, or that no particular facility related to work \nsuch as telephones, lodging, or transportation is provided, but not necessarily no benefits \nat all. To clarify this issue, additional procedures were performed, particularly verifying if \nthe first understanding is valid. Thus, the investigation centered on identifying whether the \nrespondents who chose \u201c12 = no facility given\u201d no longer provided other answers to the \nitem. Results showed that of the total 12,280 respondents who answered \u201c12 = no facility \ngiven\u201d to Q4.20, only 54 respondents supplied additional responses. Provided that almost \nall, 99.6%, gave a single answer, it was therefore concluded that the 54 cases were \nproducts of error in data processing and that choice \u201c12\u201d signifies \u201cno benefits provided\u201d.     \n5  Class of workers refers to the devised grouping, a combination of Hussmann (2004) and Chen\u2019s (2006) employment \nclassifications presented in the Section II. Class of worker is comprised of the following: employees, employers, \nown-account workers, unpaid workers, and wage workers.  ", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 17\nThus, working on this assumption, the frequency distribution of formal and informal \nworkers with benefits was computed, together with their corresponding ratios per type \nof benefit. This analysis showed the discrepancy in the amount of benefits received by \nformal and informal workers, as well as identified the kinds of benefits usually provided to \neach kind.\nIV. Informal Employment Profile\nBased on the 2005 LFS, the unemployment rate in Bangladesh is about 4%.

The figure further \nemphasizes the differences between the formal and informal employment structures: \nemployees chiefly compose the formal (79.5%), while self-employed workers dominate \nthe informal structure (45.0%). Moreover, the formal employment can generally be divided \ninto two classes, the employees and the self-employed. On the other hand, informal \nemployment has at least four distinct groupings.

For instance, (refer to Table 5) some \nrespondents identified themselves to be either self-employed or unpaid family workers \nin Q4.12 (status of employment), but also replied to be working in the government \nin Q4.13 (sector of employment) when the two questions were cross-tabulated. This \nis questionable since the logical answer for the same respondent should have been \npersonal household, personal establishment, or others. Inconsistencies of this sort are \ndiscussed in full in the preceding section. It is mentioned here for emphasis.\nOf the 47.36 million employed, 41.54 million are informal workers (87.71%), while only \n5.82 million are engaged in formal employment.  With these numbers, it is not surprising \nthat half of the employed population works in the personal household sector, and almost \na quarter, in the personal establishment.

In general, being employed in \nthe formal sector is more desirable because of better wages, working conditions, and \nbenefits. While analysis between the informal and formal sector is not possible in this \npaper due to data limitations, the succeeding analysis investigates if these results also \napply to informal workers.  It looks into the differences of wages and benefits of those \nunder informal and formal employment and whether there is reason to support the notion \nthat women are more vulnerable than men in terms of wages and benefits and type of \nemployment (informal/formal).\nA.   Wage Differentials\nAcross industries, Table 13 shows that workers in formal employment are paid better \nthan workers in informal employment. In terms of average weekly wage, the industry \ngroups with the widest wage gaps in absolute number of workers are construction \n(6,336 taka [Tk]); EGW (Tk5,995); health and social work (Tk4,950); and mining and \nquarrying (Tk4,599). Conversely, the smallest wage discrepancies are recorded in private \nhouseholds (with employed persons) at Tk1,137; followed by fishing, Tk1,645; and \neducation, Tk2,055. \nMeanwhile, formal workers in the Others category received 10 times more wages than \nthe informal workers in the same industry. Other industries with high formal\u2013informal \nwage ratios are construction, with a ratio of 8:1; mining and quarrying, 5:1; and TSC and \nagriculture, hunting, and forestry, which both registered 4:1 ratios. The lowest formal\u2013\ninformal wage ratio, on the other hand, was recorded by the education industry, at 1.5: 1. \nThe following industries posted a 2:1 ratio each: (i) financial intermediation; (ii) public \nadministration, defense, and social security; (iii) real estate, renting, and other business \nactivities; (iv) other community, social, and personal services; and (v) health and social \nwork.\nThe difference in average weekly wages between the informal and formal workers was \nalso tested for statistical significance. These results supported the conclusion of other \nstudies cited in the analytical framework, that workers engaged in formal employment \nreceive better wages on the average. Wage differential testing was also done across \nindustries, the results of which are presented in Table 13.

A p-value of .05, for example, indicates that there is only a 5% chance of \ngetting the same or more extreme test statistic if the null hypothesis is true; hence we say that the test statistic is less likely to \nhave come from the population(s) in which the null hypothesis\u2014which in this case is that there are no differences between the \nmean wages of formal and informal workers\u2014is true, and therefore, we have to reject the null hypothesis.  In statistical parlance, \nthe result is highly significant if the p-value of the test is < 0.0\u0004, and significant if the p-value is <0.05.  If the p-value is more \nthan 0.05, the null hypothesis is usually accepted and the appropriate conclusion is that there are no significant differences of \nthe mean wages in this case.  However, in the social sciences, where measurement issues abound regarding the data, these \nthresholds are usually lower. \nWorkers in informal employment receive the highest mean weekly wages in financial \nintermediation (Tk6047.35), education (Tk4196.04), and public administration \n(Tk3997.15). These industries, however, have marginal informal employment, with only \n1.3% informal workers or just a little over 500,000 out of 41.5 million workers. Apart from \n\u201cOthers\u201d, informal workers earned the least in agriculture (Tk652.93), fishing (Tk890.68), \nand construction (Tk942.31), which comprise 24.1 million informal workers.     \nFor those with formal employment, the top three highest mean weekly wages are given \nin the sectors on financial intermediation (Tk9693.27); EGW (Tk8,467.92); and health \nand social work (Tk8302.99). Note however, that these three industries account only for \na mere 11.6% of formal workers. The bottom three sectors with the lowest mean weekly \nwages are private households with employed persons (Tk2109.16); fishing (Tk2535.27); \nand agriculture, hunting, and forestry (Tk2737.64); accounting for only 2.3% of formal \nworkers. ", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 25\nThe minimum monthly wage for garment workers was adjusted to Tk1,662  in 2006, \nfrom Tk950 since 1994 (The Associated Press 2006). Compared with the mean weekly \nwages for the manufacturing sector, Tk3,882 (formal) and Tk1,419 (informal), the cited \nminimum monthly wage translating to a weekly wage of Tk416 is really low, considering \nas well that data for wages were taken in 2005\u20132006. It should be noted, however, that \ndata for manufacturing showed a range of wages as little as Tk20 to as high as Tk42,000 \na week. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is the diverse composition of the \nrespondents in manufacturing in terms of job positions, such that managers, supervisors, \nand other executive level workers comprised the high wage levels, while less skilled or \nspecialized workers supplied the data on low salary rates. Another possible reason is \nthe variation in subsectors of manufacturing itself; those working in steel, fuel and oil, \nor cement production, are perceived to receive more than the garment workers. Other \npossible explanations are the seasonality of informal sector work in the garments industry \nor possible errors in coding or enumeration.  On the former, the survey may have been \nconducted when the garment industry was not very active.  On the latter, since the \npublished minimum monthly wage is way below the computed mean wage data from LFS, \nthere is a strong possibility that responses to wages were provided in terms of monthly, \nrather than weekly, rates that have been specified in the questionnaire. This conjecture \ncould have been validated in the data processing stage if data ranges were specified in \nconsistency checking. Suspect data could have been verified in the field.  However, this \ntype of verification is not possible anymore since the 2005 LFS has long been completed. \nFor the following, the wage/earnings of the unpaid family workers were included. \nDiscussion on this set of data was presented in the earlier sections, including the \nrationalization for using the results for analysis. \nAn attempt to apply the model of Chen (2004), as presented in Figure 1 in the section on \nthe analytical framework where the segmentation of the informal economy is represented \nby an iceberg, is shown in Figure 5. However, the model has been modified to show the \nrelative sizes of the different segments, in addition to their relative visibility and earnings. \nFrom top to bottom, Chen\u2019s model holds true in terms of the mean wage. The most \nvisible or the best known segment, the employers, is at the top of the iceberg, and at the \nbase lies the least visible segment, the wage workers. The diagram also shows similar \nfindings as Chen et al. (2006), that in the informal economy, the self-employed earn less \nthan employees but more than casual wage workers. \nBut since this modified version also includes representation of relative sizes of the \nsegments instead of a solid triangle base, the diagram illustrates broken lines at the \nbottom layer of the iceberg. The broken lines represent the relative size of the wage \nworkers as compared to the other segments. If the broken lines were followed, the \nmodel would take on the shape of a one-dimensional diamond cut instead of a triangle \nor an iceberg. Interpreting the modified model in the case of Bangladesh: (i) the higher \nthe visibility of the segment, the higher is its relative wage/earnings; and (ii) in general, ", "\u0018\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 155\nthe higher the relative wage/earnings, the lesser is the relative size of the segment. It \nwould be interesting to see if the \u201ccut\u201d (broken lines) in segments would also appear in \nother informal economies, and at which segment the cut would apply. The second finding \nmay be expounded and tested if the following interpretation will hold merit\u2014that in the \nformal economy, as a segment becomes more visible, the greater is the requirement for \nspecialization, which also translates to a fewer number or size of the segment and higher \nwages received.\nFigure 5: Segmentation of the Informal Economy of Bangladesh\nEmployer\n(n=118,056)\nTk 5,716.03\nEmployee\n(n=1,939,067)\nTk 3,301.62\nUnpaid worker\n(n=10,267,496)\nTk 2,234.14\nSelf-employed\n(n=18,677,635)\nTk 1,613.41\nWage worker\n(n=10,535,754)\nTk 745.55\nB.

Benefits\nAs expected, more workers with formal employment have paid leaves and bonuses. The \nonly benefit that more informal sector workers enjoy than workers in formal employment \nare free meals and free lodging. Not shown in the figure below are the workers who do \nnot receive any form of benefit, numbering close to 9 million, 95% of which have informal \nemployment. Indeed, this figure illustrates that workers in informal employment have \nlesser benefits than those in formal employment.\nTable 18 shows the employment benefits received by class of worker under formal and \ninformal employment. The bonuses, paid sick leave, and paid holdings are the top types \nof benefits enjoyed by both formal and informal employees. In fact, there are narrow \npercentage differences between the formal and informal employees who answered these \nchoices. On the other hand, there is a steep discrepancy between formal, at 4.4%, and \ninformal employees, at 19.1%, who did not receive any benefits. \nAmong formal own-account workers, the most common benefits received are bonuses, \nfree lodging, and paid sick leaves, while the informal own-account workers\u2019 top choice \nanswers are bonuses, paid holdings, and paid sick leaves. Like in the case of employees, \nthere is also a wide percentage difference among formal and informal own-account \nworkers who did not receive any benefits, at 17.0% and 51.1%, respectively.

It can also be observed that the percentage of \nunpaid family workers with no benefits received, at 27.7%, is relatively lower than the \nown-account workers and wage workers.

Since a respondent may answer more than once to this question, Q4.20, a respondent is likely to be counted \nmore than once in the computation of the total. However, a respondent is limited by its class of worker and nature of \nemployment, thus analysis by these set of conditions is possible.  \nIt is assumed that those respondents who answered \u201cno benefits\u201d are counted only once. \nVI. Conclusions and Recommendations\nThis study was able to develop a methodology for classifying workers under formal \nor informal employment, making measurement and analysis of informal employment \npossible using a questionnaire that was not designed for such purpose, and given the \nmany unresolved problems in data processing and validation. The application of the \ninternationally accepted definition of informal employment on the 2005 LFS proved to be \ndifficult because of issues that could not be tackled after the 2005 LFS was conducted \nand processed. Hence, for analysis to be performed, the formal employment was first \nidentified with the assumption that its complement is all informal employment. With this \nworkable definition, it was found that informal employment dominates Bangladesh\u2019s labor \nmarket, with 87.71% of the total employed working under informal circumstances. The \nbiggest concentration of informal workers is in the rural areas, with 92%, and the least \ndense at the SMA level, where 67.2% of the workers are informal.  \nWorkers in informal employment are mostly in the agriculture, hunting and forestry, \nwholesale and retail trade; manufacturing; and transport, storage and communications \nsectors. The Government of Bangladesh employs most of the workers under formal \nemployment. As expected, workers with formal employment are consistently better \npaid than those with informal employment. The mean wages for informal and formal ", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 33\nemployees are significantly different by each sector but they are markedly different \nin construction; in EGW; in mining; and in transport, storage and communication.  \nAgriculture informal workers are paid the least while those under financial intermediation \nreceive the highest wages among informal workers.\nIn the informal economy, employers have the highest earnings and wage workers, the \nlowest but those self-employed constitute the biggest segment. Most women are informal \nworkers and they are paid less than men of similar class and industry, except for in the \nmining and quarrying; EGW; and others. Male informal workers dominate all industries \nexcept for personal households.\nInformal workers are found to have significantly less benefits than those with formal \nemployment, except for free meals and free lodging. In particular, self-employed and \nunpaid workers comprise a little over 20 million of informal workers, but less than 2 \nmillion of them enjoy benefits.  \nThese results were derived from survey data that are beset with consistency issues \nand design problems (Maligalig and Barcenas 2008) that cannot be resolved because \nof the almost 3 years that had elapsed from the conduct and processing of the survey.  \nIf this survey had just been processed and the inconsistencies properly identified then \nsupervisors and enumerators could have gone back to respondents to verify suspect \ndata. It is rather unfortunate, however, that this process of verification cannot be done \nanymore. Moreover, correct selection probabilities cannot be specified because the \nselection processes were not properly documented. Because of these, the results of this \nsurvey will be continuously questioned, discounting the value of the results that were \nobtained from the survey.\nTo ensure that surveys, which are usually very expensive to conduct, are utilized to their \nfullest, surveys should be designed, conducted, and processed following standards that \nhave been tested and accepted. In this case, if analysis of informal employment is one \nof the objectives of the survey, the questions that have been tested to screen for informal \nemployment should be incorporated. Examples of such questions are in Appendix 2.  \nIn general, the questionnaire should be designed to fulfill the objectives of the survey.  \nQuestions and response choices should be formulated within the analytical framework of \nthe study. These questions and choices should add clarity and not confuse data users.  \nSkipping patterns can be properly introduced to reduce the response time. To ensure that \nthe questionnaire has comprehensive coverage of the objectives of the survey, this should \nbe tested in the field, and the results should also be processed. This pretest can also be \na time and motion study that will give survey managers an indication of how much time \nan enumerator needs to administer a questionnaire and what steps should be done by \nsupervisors to ensure the proper administration of the survey questionnaire.", "3\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 155\nManuals for enumerators and supervisors should be developed to anticipate and address \nissues that may occur in the field such as clarification of concepts and terminology, \nrefusal to provide answers, incomplete answers, etc. The manuals should include \nclear definitions of all concepts and terminologies that are used in the questionnaire, \nprobing questions that have tested to elicit responses, procedures for replacing sample \nhouseholds that cannot be located, among others. These manuals are necessary survey \ninstruments for reducing data issues such as those identified in the methodology section \nand consequently, for controlling nonsampling errors that occur in the field.\nAnother measure that can reduce suspect data is a good training program for \nenumerators and supervisors in which all facets of the questionnaire and procedures for \nmanual edits and completeness checks are clearly explained.\nIf some errors are not identified in the field, they can also be screened during the data \nvalidation stage, when usually data have been entered into an electronic file that can \nautomatically be reviewed against preset business rules. In this stage, various types of \ndata checks are applied. For questions with a clear set of choice answers, then checks \ncan be applied on acceptable answer codes. Otherwise, acceptable data range (for \nweekly wage for example) can also be set. Known relationships of questions/responses \ncan also be reviewed. For example, unpaid workers should not have wages. This \nbusiness rule can easily be built into the data validation stage. Those responses that \nare suspect can be checked against the questionnaires and if needed, enumerators can \nreturn to the respondents for verification.\nCare must be given to the survey sampling design and estimation procedures. The \nformer, if done correctly, guarantees that conclusions drawn from the survey will also \napply to the whole population. Sampling errors of major characteristics or indicators must \nbe derived to give an indication of the reliability of the survey. Correct survey weights \nmust be used to ensure unbiased estimates.", "Informal Employment in Bangladesh  | 35\nAppendix 1: Annual Labor Force Survey, 2005\u201306 \nQuestionnaire\nTeam: Govt. of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh Confidential\nBangladesh Bureau of Statistics (Personally given data will not be discolsed)\nQuarter: Industry and Labour Wing\nParisankhyan Bhaban\nRound: E-27/A, Agargaon, Dhaka-\u0004207.

Results from the 2005 Bangladesh Labor Force Survey show that 87.71% of the \nemployed in Bangladesh are engaged in informal employment, and that wage differentials \nbetween the formal and informal workers are significant in all industry sectors. Workers \nengaged in informal employment are mostly in agriculture; hunting and forestry; wholesale \nand retail trade; manufacturing; and transport, storage, and communications sectors. \nWomen are most likely to be engaged in informal employment than men. \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No.: \nPrinted in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Dalisay S.
