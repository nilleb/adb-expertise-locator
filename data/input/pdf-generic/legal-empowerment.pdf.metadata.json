It gives people the knowledge, skills, and confidence to \nparticipate in development projects. It promotes inclusive growth, which reduces poverty by building people\u2019s \ncapacity to improve their lives. Inclusive growth is a goal of Strategy 2020, which guides the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in its mission to promote gender equality, empower women, and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nThe report presents the findings of a project funded by ADB, carried out by The Asia Foundation, and conducted \n\nin Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan. The project aimed to identify and test legal empowerment strategies that \nincrease access to basic social services, productive resources, and opportunities by women and other disadvantaged \ngroups and to incorporate legal empowerment initiatives into mainstream development projects.\n\nAbout The Asia Foundation \n\nThe Asia Foundation is a non-profit, non-governmental organization committed to the development of a peaceful, \nprosperous, just, and open Asia-Pacific region. The Foundation supports programs in Asia that help improve \ngovernance, law, and civil society; women's empowerment; economic reform and development; and international \nrelations. Drawing on more than 50 years of experience in Asia, the Foundation collaborates with private and public \npartners to support leadership and institutional development, exchanges, and policy research.\n\nWith a network of 17 offices throughout Asia, an office in Washington, DC, and its headquarters in San Francisco, \n\nthe Foundation addresses these issues on both a country and regional level. In 2007, the Foundation provided more \nthan $68 million in program support and distributed 974,000 books and educational materials valued at $33 million \nthroughout Asia.\n\nThe Asia Foundation is not an endowed organization, and depends solely on monetary contributions from donors \n\nto accomplish its work.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries \nsubstantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region's many successes, it \nremains home to two thirds of the world's poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million \nstruggling on less than $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its \n\ndeveloping member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical \nassistance.\n\nL\ne\ng\na\nl\n \nE\nm\np\no\nw\ne\nr\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \nf\no\nr\n \n\n \n\nW\no\nm\ne\nn\n \na\nn\nd\nD\ni\ns\na\nd\nv\na\nn\nt\na\ng\ne\nd\nG\nr\no\nu\np\ns\n\n \n\nThe Asia Foundation\n465 California Street, 9th Floor \nSan Francisco, California, USA 94104 \n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444\nFax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\ninformation@adb.org\n\nISBN 978-971-561-759-8\nPSN BBK219708\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nLegal \nEmpowerment \nfor Women and \nDisadvantaged \nGroups\n\n\fLegal Empowerment for Women  \nand Disadvantaged Groups\n\nFINAL REPORT\n\n\fAsian Development Bank.\n \nMandaluyong City, Phil.: Asian Development Bank, 2009.\n\nLegal empowerment for women and disadvantaged groups.\n\n1.

Under its long-term strategic framework \n2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), ADB will follow strategic \nagendas in helping its member countries reduce poverty \nand improve their people\u2019s quality of life, including fos-\ntering inclusive growth. Inclusive growth seeks to reduce \npoverty by building people\u2019s capacity to improve their \nlives. It supports coherent social integration and seeks \nto promote gender equality and empower women. It is \na fundamental component of ADB\u2019s mission to reduce \npoverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \nLegal empowerment employs a range of initiatives to \nbuild  people\u2019s  knowledge,  skills,  and  confidence.  It \nspecifically works toward building equality and empow-\nering people and therefore complements ADB\u2019s mission \nof reducing poverty.\n\nIn developing nations, women and disadvantaged \ngroups are frequently the most oppressed and poorly \neducated. ADB has implemented many development \nsector programs designed to improve the lives of wom-\nen and the disadvantaged. However, it can be difficult \nto ensure that project benefits actually reach women \nand the disadvantaged. They can be too disempowered \nto claim their entitlements or may lack the education \nand understanding that they have entitlements under \na project. This presents a significant challenge for ADB \ndevelopment specialists.\n\nLegal empowerment initiatives aim to give women \nand disadvantaged groups confidence, information, \ntraining,  and  assistance.  It  is  intended  that  women \nand  disadvantaged  groups  will  apply  these  skills  in \nprotecting  their  legal  rights  and  claiming  benefits \nunder development programs. The initiatives can also \nbe used to empower public officials. Throughout the \ncourse of this legal empowerment project, the proj-\nect team found that it was also useful to give public \nofficials  information  and  practical  guidance  so  that \nthey could actively participate in running development \nprograms. \n\nBy giving vulnerable groups skills and confidence, \nlegal  empowerment  initiatives  empower  people  to \nactively participate in and work with project staff in sec-\ntor development projects, meaning that development \nprojects have better prospects of delivering on project \nobjectives. This is why legal empowerment is such a \npowerful tool for ADB development specialists.\n\nBecause legal empowerment is such a useful tool \nfor  the  development  community,  it  is  important  to \nexplain  its  concepts  and  strategies.  Therefore,  this \nreport seeks to explain\n\n(i) \n\nwhat is legal empowerment,\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nhow  legal  empowerment  is  relevant  to  the  \ndevelopment community, and\n\nhow  the  development  community  can  incor-\nporate legal empowerment initiatives into their \ndevelopment programs.\n\nOverview of ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance for Legal Empowerment\n\nChapter  2  explores  ADB\u2019s  rationale  for  funding-\nTAF  to  engage  in  legal  empowerment  strategies  in \nthree  developing  Asian  countries:  Bangladesh,  In-\ndonesia, and Pakistan. In particular, ADB wanted to  \n(i)  identify  what  legal  empowerment  strategies  give \nwomen and disadvantaged groups the greatest access  \nto  basic  social  services,  productive  resources,  and \ngrowth opportunities; and (ii) assess the most efficient \nway  of  incorporating  legal  empowerment  initiatives \ninto  mainstream  development  projects.  Using  the \nbenefit of earlier research, ADB and TAF incorporated \ntwo  new  and  innovative  features  into  the  project: \n(i) the integration of legal empowerment in existing  \nsocioeconomic development projects; and (ii) before and \nafter surveys in areas subjected to legal empowerment  \n\n\fviii\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\ninitiatives and those without initiatives to assess wheth-\ner the initiatives had resulted in any change. Chapter 2 \nprovides an overview of how the project team selected \nsuitable development projects into which they could \nweave  legal  empowerment  initiatives  and  considers \nthe lessons learned under the project.\n\nDefining and Measuring the Impact \nof Legal Empowerment\n\nBefore designing the legal empowerment activities, the \nproject team needed to define \u201clegal empowerment\u201d \nfor the purposes of the project. The project team ad-\nopted a new definition for legal empowerment that is \ndifferent to previous definitions: \u201cthe ability of women \nand disadvantaged groups to use legal and administra-\ntive processes and structures to access resources, ser-\nvices, and opportunities.\u201d In adopting this definition, \nthe project team sought to place greater emphasis on \nthe importance of providing project beneficiaries with \npractical skills and confidence to empower themselves \nin the future. This technique differed to previous notions  \nof legal empowerment, which tended to focus on pro-\nviding information on legal rights or legal assistance. \nBy giving women and disadvantaged groups specific \nknowledge and skills, it is hoped that they will become \nmore confident about voicing their expectations and \ndemand responsible action from public officials and \nagencies. When large groups of people push for policy \nchange at the grassroots level, they have better pros-\npects of influencing governance and decision making \nand improving their lives. \n\nOnce the definition of legal empowerment was \nsettled,  the  project  team  determined  the  project  \nobjectives  and  designed  activities.  The  project  team \nalso  considered  how  they  could  best  monitor  and \nevaluate  their  progress  with  achieving  the  intended \noutcomes. The solution was to develop a questionnaire \nthat  could  directly  survey  the  project\u2019s  beneficiaries \nand therefore monitor and evaluate the success of the \nproject\u2019s activities. The survey represents a significant \nstep forward in legal empowerment activities. It is an \nimportant tool for assessing whether the legal empow-\nerment activities are working and how they might be \nimproved. Chapter 3 provides an analysis of how the \nproject team developed the survey instrument and the \nchallenges they faced in ensuring that the survey data \n\ncollected was an accurate reflection of the project\u2019s \nprogress. The survey instrument is also included in the \nreport at Appendix 4.\n\nPilot Projects\n\nThe  project  is  ADB\u2019s  second  formal  focus  on  legal \nempowerment  and  its  broader  implications  for  de-\nvelopment programs. To that extent, legal empower-\nment is still in a growth phase, making it important \nto  demonstrate  the  potential  positive  outcomes  of \nlegal empowerment. To ensure the project\u2019s success, \nthe project team focused on identifying development \nprojects  that  would  successfully  lend  themselves  to \nintegrating legal empowerment activities. Chapter 4 \nof the report discusses how the project team identi-\nfied suitable projects. It also provides an analysis of \nthe (i) objectives of the pilot projects, (ii) local partner \norganizations involved in the pilot projects, (iii) legal \nempowerment  activities  undertaken  under  the  pilot \nprojects, and (iv) achievements and challenges of the \ndifferent pilot projects.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nChapter 5 highlights the major findings of the project \nwith respect to ensuring the success of legal empower-\nment activities. These are:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProject specialists must concentrate on investing \nin pilot project activities and developing special-\nized monitoring and evaluation methodologies \nto  assess  the  impact  of  legal  empowerment \nprograms. This should  give development spe-\ncialists  the  empirical  evidence  they  need  to \nconvince sector project managers and resource \nmanagers of the value of legal empowerment \nto their projects.\n\nIt is essential to develop strong and coopera-\ntive working relationships between the design-\ners  and  implementers  of  legal  empowerment  \nactivities and their ADB and government coun-\nterparts. As the different parties may have differ-\nent backgrounds, it is fundamental to develop \na  common  terminology  that  describes  legal \n\n\fExecutive Summary\n\nix\n\nempowerment concepts and records experience \nin  practical  terms  that  are  readily  understood \nby all involved. \n\nbe  included  from  the  outset  of  an  ADB  host \nproject.\n\n(iii) \n\nLegal empowerment work relies upon developing \ncomplex and mutually reinforcing working rela-\ntionships between varying parties. This is essential \nfor encouraging public officials and agencies to \nassume a sense of ownership in the work.\n\n(iv)  Great care and consideration must be taken in \nselecting the project location. In some cases, an \nideal pilot project location is one in which the \nADB host project has been working for a rea-\nsonable period and reached certain milestones \nin  the  sequence  of  implementation,  while  in \nother cases a legal empowerment activity may \n\n(v) \n\nIt is important to appreciate that legal empower-\nment is a long-term process and that the best \nresults are achieved over time.\n\nAs the pilot projects were undertaken over a short \ntime period, it is difficult to assess whether the project \nled to long-term behavioral modification. Nevertheless, \nthe  project  generated  sufficient  data  to  affirm  that \nlegal  empowerment  measures  can  advance  gover-\nnance reform and poverty reduction and support the \nachievement of development project goals. ADB and \nother international agencies are encouraged to invest \nin projects that will advance the integration of legal \nempowerment in development projects.\n\n\f\fIntroduction\n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  conducted  a \ntechnical assistance (TA) project that promoted legal \nempowerment  in  three  developing  Asian  countries: \nBangladesh,  Indonesia,  and  Pakistan.  The  project  \nexplored  the  potential  for  legal  empowerment  to \nreduce  poverty,  improve  governance,  and  promote \nmore inclusive development\u2014particularly for women. \nThe  project  included  preliminary  country  situation \nanalysis, pilot legal empowerment projects that were \nintegrated into host ADB loans, and a rigorous evalu-\nation  methodology.  It  aimed  to  (i)  identify  and  test \nlegal  empowerment  strategies  that  increase  access \nto  basic  social  services,  productive  resources,  and \nopportunities  by  women  and  other  disadvantaged \ngroups;  and  (ii)  promote  increased  incorporation  of \nlegal  empowerment  initiatives  within  mainstream \ndevelopment projects. The project was funded under \nADB TA 6248-REG\u2014Legal Empowerment for Women \nand  Disadvantaged  Groups.  ADB  engaged  TAF  to \nundertake activities under the project.\n\nThis  report  presents  the  findings  of  the  project \nand  incorporates  feedback  provided  by  participants \nin the Regional Conference on Legal Empowerment \nfor Women and Disadvantaged Groups held at ADB \nin Manila on 13\u201314 December 2007. The conference \nmarked the project\u2019s completion and presented project \nfindings and recommendations. \n\nThere  are  six  chapters  in  this  report.  Chapter  2 \n(Overview  of  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  for  Legal \nEmpowerment)  summarizes  the  evolution  of  ADB\u2019s \nperspective on the nexus between legal empowerment \nand development, describes ADB\u2019s previous support \nfor  legal  empowerment  initiatives,  and  provides  an \noverview of the project. Chapter 3 (Defining the Frame-\nwork of Legal Empowerment Initiatives and Measuring  \nTheir  Impact)  discusses  the  challenges  involved  in \n\ndefining and measuring legal empowerment and pres-\nents the definition of legal empowerment and evalu-\nation  tools  developed  under  this  project.  Chapter  4  \n(Pilot Projects) provides a detailed description of the \nlegal  empowerment  pilot  projects  developed  and \nimplemented in each of the three project countries. \nChapter 5 (Conclusions and Recommendations) pres-\nents the overall results of the project and its ensuing \nrecommendations. \n\nAdditionally,  the  report  contains  a  series  of \nsupplementary appendixes that provide more detailed  \ninformation  on  specific  elements  of  the  project.  \nAppendix 1 (Overview of Legal Empowerment) pres-\nents the conceptual framework of legal empowerment \nthat influenced the project design and implementa-\ntion.

Legal Empowerment: Advancing Good Gover\u00ad\nnance and Poverty Reduction in Law and Policy Reform at \nADB, pp. 7\u2013164. \n\n\fOverview of ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance for Legal \nEmpowerment\n\nADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy has shifted away from \nusing income levels as the sole indicator of poverty. ADB \nnow  adopts  a  broader  definition  that  encompasses \nequality of rights; protection against harmful or illegal \npractices; and access to existing resources, services, and \nopportunities. Development assistance is undermined \nwhen citizens face systemic obstacles preventing them \nfrom  enforcing  their  rights  and  accessing  productive \nresources,  economic  opportunities,  and  public  ser-\nvices. The connection among poverty, governance, and  \nempowerment is reflected in ADB\u2019s 1999 policy paper, \nFighting  Poverty  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific:  The  Poverty \nReduction  Strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank. \nThe paper asserts that:\n\n[I]n ADB\u2019s view, poverty is a deprivation of \nessential assets and opportunities to which \nevery human is entitled. Beyond income and \nbasic services, individuals and societies are \nalso poor\u2014and tend to remain so\u2014if they \nare not empowered to participate in making \nthe decisions that shape their lives.2\n\nIn view of poverty\u2019s tendency to self perpetuate, \nADB views legal empowerment as a way of enhancing \nthe effectiveness of development assistance in helping \nimprove the lives of disadvantaged groups. Providing \nlegal empowerment in conjunction with ongoing deve-\nlopment efforts helps citizens engage with legal and \nadministrative institutions so they may address critical \n\n2  ADB. 1999. Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The \n\nPoverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n(R179\u00ad99), p. 5.\n\nThe 2001 ADB legal empowerment study found that \nlegal  empowerment  is  most  effective  when  used  as \na tool to improve people\u2019s daily lives, such as access \nto water, sanitation, or health care. It also found that \nengaging civil society organizations to work with local \ncommunities as well as government agencies and of-\nficials was an effective tool. In addition, it found that \nlegal empowerment helps strengthen socioeconomic \ndevelopment  efforts  in  a  variety  of  areas,  including \nnatural  resource  management  and  conservation, \nrural  development,  land  tenure,  decentralization, \nand women\u2019s health. Also, prospects of certain sec-\ntor  development  initiatives  achieving  their  intended \ngoals  actually  increase  where  a  legal  empowerment \ncomponent is incorporated.\n\n\f\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nimpediments that prevent them from participating in \nand benefiting from development assistance. \n\nPrevious ADB Work on  \nLegal Empowerment\n\nIn 2001, ADB engaged TAF to conduct a seven-coun-\ntry  study  that  examined  the  present  and  prospective \nrole  of  legal  empowerment  in  advancing  good  gov-\nernance  and  poverty  reduction.3  The  study  examined \nthe key constraints preventing disadvantaged groups \nfrom accessing legal, administrative, and governance \nmechanisms and, consequently, limiting the success of \npoverty  reduction  efforts.  It  also  analyzed  successful \nlegal  empowerment  projects  and  identified  in  those \nprojects  common  features  and  effective  strategies  \nfor  overcoming  challenging  conditions.  The  study \nprovides concrete guidance and recommendations on \nhow to design, implement, and assess the impact of \neffective legal empowerment projects.\n\nThe Foundation tested the 2001 ADB legal em-\npowerment study\u2019s recommendations under a variety \nof  pilot  program  initiatives.  One  such  initiative  was \nthe  Indonesia  Irrigation  Sector  Legal  Empowerment \nStudy (2001\u20132003), which the Foundation undertook \nin conjunction with ADB. The Government of the Neth-\nerlands  also  provided  financial  support.  This  project \nemployed a legal empowerment approach to promote \ngreater citizen participation in the context of a national \nintegrated water management project. It featured a \nseries of  pilot projects that demonstrated that  legal \nempowerment activities helped advance the goals of \nthe host water sector projects. While previous research \nhas indicated that legal empowerment can contribute \nto poverty reduction and improved governance stan-\ndards, it has also questioned the causal nature of these \nconnections, as well as the most effective modalities \nfor achieving these desired outcomes, particularly in \nthe context of large-scale development projects. \n\nInnovative Features of the Project\n\nBuilding on the recommendations of the 2001 ADB  \nlegal  empowerment  study  and  its  call  for  further  \n \n\n3 \n\nFootnote 1.\n\nresearch, the project aimed to refine understanding of \nlegal empowerment and test its potential to result in \nmore inclusive development. Under the project, pilot \nlegal empowerment initiatives were implemented in  \nBangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan. These pilot projects  \naimed  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  socioeco-\nnomic development projects in reaching their target \nbeneficiaries,  including  women  and  disadvantaged \ngroups.\n\nThe project advanced legal empowerment work \nto  date  with  two  innovative  features:  (i) integrating \nlegal  empowerment  in  socioeconomic  development \nprojects, and (ii) implementing a rigorous evaluation \nmethodology  that  compared  results  in  geographic \nareas where pilot legal empowerment activities were \nundertaken  with  control  areas  (or  control  sites)  in \nwhich no legal empowerment work was undertaken. \nThese features are summarized below and presented \nin greater detail later in the report. \n\nIntegrating Legal Empowerment  \nand Mainstream Development\n\nOne of the project\u2019s key questions was: can adding a \nlegal  empowerment  component  enhance  the  impact \nof  development  assistance  by  helping  to  ensure  that \nwomen and disadvantaged groups can use legal and \nadministrative  processes  and  structures  to  access  \nresources, services, and opportunities?\n\nOften  there  is  a  gap  between  the  objectives  of \nsocioeconomic  development  projects  and  their  re-\nsults. This may be, in part, because of the fact that \ntheir success relies on the active engagement of key \nstakeholders,  including  both  citizens  and  local-level \nofficials. It is often the case that these individuals lack \nthe  knowledge,  skills,  confidence,  or  motivation  to \nparticipate in ways that are envisioned in the project \ndocuments. Legal empowerment can help bridge this \ngap by providing vulnerable groups with the informa-\ntion,  training,  assistance,  and  confidence  that  they \nneed to enforce their legal rights and harness existing \nand new opportunities presented through mainstream \ndevelopment initiatives, while providing public officials \nwith information and practical guidance that will help \nthem to better fulfill their roles and responsibilities in \nadministering development programs. \n\nThe project examined the legal and administrative \nrequirements for citizens to access the benefits pro-\nvided under ADB loans in the three project countries. \n\n\fOverview of ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance for Legal Empowerment\n\n\u0018\n\nA  common  research  instrument  was  developed  to \ncapture and track indicators of legal empowerment, \nincluding levels of knowledge and confidence, strate-\ngies employed by vulnerable groups to enforce their \nrights,  and  outcomes  achieved.  The  instrument  was \nindigenized to capture unique features of each of the \nthree pilot projects in terms of country context, ADB \nhost project, and legal empowerment interventions. \nWhile  previous  studies  have  noted  correlations  bet-\nween legal empowerment and indicators of improved \ngovernance  and  reduced  poverty,  the  methodology \ndeveloped  for  the  project  aimed  to  examine  causal  \nrelationships.  It  asked:  can  changes  observed  be  \nattributed to legal empowerment interventions? \n\nIn this context, legal requirements refer to conditions \nor requirements that are prescribed by law, while ad-\nministrative requirements refer to the procedural steps \nto be followed by prospective or target beneficiaries \nunder the administrative structure of an ADB loan or \nassociated  government  rules  and  regulations.  Legal \nempowerment  pilot  initiatives  were  then  developed \nto  address  potential  obstacles  to  participation  by \nstrengthening the capacity of women and disadvan-\ntaged groups to navigate relevant legal and adminis-\ntrative processes. \n\nResearch Methodology\n\nA distinctive feature of the project was the develop-\nment  of  a  rigorous  evaluation  methodology,  which \nemployed  empirical  tools  to  measure  the  impact  of \nlegal  empowerment.  The  research  methodology, \nwhich was implemented in both project and control \nlocations,  sought  to  establish  an  empirical  basis  for \nunderstanding if and when legal empowerment would \nlead to an improved quality of life for women and other \ndisadvantaged groups. A more detailed description of \nthe research methodology and key findings is provided \nin Chapter 4.\n\nOverview of the Project\n\nThe  sections  below  provide  a  brief  summary  of  the \nproject\u2019s various phases.\n\nCountry Situation Analysis Reports\n\nThe project involved an initial research phase, during \nwhich sociolegal consultants in each of the three coun-\ntries were engaged to undertake CSAs and document \ntheir findings in reports. The reports were intended to \nenhance the knowledge base of the country program \nenvironments  for  legal  empowerment  and  guide  the \nselection, design, and implementation of the three pilot \nlegal empowerment initiatives. The CSA reports identi-\nfied the range of public and private agencies involved \nin legal empowerment activities, assessed their relative \nstrengths and weaknesses, and influenced the design of \npilot projects implemented through the project. Draft \nversions of these reports were disseminated to relevant \ngovernment and civil society stakeholders for comments \nand feedback, which were then incorporated into the \nfinal versions. Appendix 2 provides summaries of the \nCSA reports. \n\nCountry Consultations\n\nIn  June  and  August  2007,  the  project  team  held \nworkshops  in  Dhaka,  Jakarta,  and  Islamabad.  They \npresented background on the project and the findings \nand recommendations of the CSA reports. Participants \nincluded legal empowerment practitioners, academic \nspecialists, government officials, and representatives of \ndonor agencies. The CSA reports were revised on the \nbasis of participant inputs, while the design and imple-\nmentation of the pilot legal empowerment projects\u2014 \ndescribed  as  follows\u2014also  took  account  of  the  \nworkshop proceedings.\n\nIdentifying Appropriate  \nADB Host Projects \n\nThe second phase of the project involved designing pilot \nlegal empowerment projects. The first step in designing \npilot legal empowerment initiatives required reviewing \ncurrent  ADB  country  project  portfolios  for  the  three \ncountries to assess the potential for legal empowerment \nto enhance project performance. The basic criteria for \ndetermining whether to initiate a legal empowerment \ncomponent included reviewing the laws, regulations, \nand  procedures  governing  access  to  resources,  basic \nsocial services, and opportunities. Some questions that \nwere considered included: \n\n\f\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\n(i) \n\nDoes the mainstream development project touch \non any administrative or legal process that might \npose obstacles to intended beneficiaries?\n\nPilot Projects\n\n(ii)  Must  beneficiaries  apply  through  formal  pro-\ncedures to gain access to the resources, basic \nsocial  services,  and  opportunities  provided  by \nthe project? \n\n(iii) \n\nIf  the  implementing  agency  is  a  government \nentity, what sort of administrative procedures \nor  legal  documentation  are  required  to  gain \naccess  to  resources,  basic  social  services,  and \nopportunities?\n\nLegal  empowerment  can  be  especially  useful  if \naccessing benefits that a project is intended to confer \ninvolves  navigating  complex  legal  and  procedural  \nrequirements. It is not only women and disadvantaged \ngroups that find these processes daunting; in many \ncases, even the local officials responsible for admin-\nistering  a  project  are  not  completely  comfortable \nwith charting a course through the maze of laws and \nprocedures, and will benefit from practical guidance. \nIn selecting ADB projects for legal empowerment proj-\nects, the following criteria were taken into account:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  strategic  value  of  specific  sector  areas  of \nfocus in each country,\n\nthe legal framework and institutions in which \nactivities are undertaken,\n\n(iii) \n\ngovernment agencies involved,\n\n(iv) \n\nintended beneficiaries,\n\n(v) \n\npotential  partnerships  between  government \nagencies and civil society organizations,\n\n(vi) \n\nanticipated impacts on women and disadvan-\ntaged groups,\n\n(vii)  practical operating modalities for the legal em-\n\npowerment pilot initiatives, and \n\n(viii) \n\nrelevant  experiences  of  other  development \npartners.\n\nBased on the project team\u2019s analysis of these criteria, \nand  extensive  consultation  with  ADB  counterparts  in \nManila, Dhaka, Jakarta, and Islamabad, legal empower-\nment pilot projects were initiated in the context of the \nfollowing ADB sector development projects: the Second \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Proj-\nect (SSSWRDSP) in Bangladesh; the Neighborhood Up-\ngrading and Shelter Sector Project (NUSSP) in Indonesia; \nand the Sindh Devolved Social Services Program (DSSP) \nin Pakistan. Further information on each of these ADB \nloans and the complementary pilot legal empowerment \ninitiatives is provided in Chapter 5.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe  monitoring  and  evaluation  effort  aimed  to  shed \nlight on the connections (or lack thereof) between legal \nempowerment and improved governance and poverty \nalleviation. Standard research instruments and protocols \nwere developed and implemented in conjunction with \nthe  three  pilot  projects.  The  monitoring  and  evalua-\ntion effort required an initial training phase to ensure \nthat the researchers had the understanding, skills, and \nsensitivity  to  implement  the  research  methodology  \neffectively. It also involved conducting baseline and end-\nof-project research in two project sites and one control \nsite in each of the three project countries, together with \nsupplementary qualitative interviews, where necessary, \nto  expand  the  finer  points  of  the  quantitative  data. \nChapter 3 and Appendix 3 provide a more detailed des-\ncription of the research methodology and findings. \n\nSupplementary ADB Portfolio Review\n\nIn addition to the individual country portfolio reviews \nthat guided the selection of the pilot project, the regional  \ntechnical assistance included a supplementary ADB port-\nfolio review that was conducted during the final phase \nof  implementation.  The  supplementary  review  in  the \nthree focal countries aimed to identify project activities \nholding the greatest potential for incorporating legal \nempowerment pilot program components that could \nserve as demonstration models for future replication and \nexpansion. A portfolio review consultant interacted with \nmembers of the project team, ADB\u2019s project manager, \nand program staff of ADB headquarters and resident \n\n\fOverview of ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance for Legal Empowerment\n\n\u0018\n\nmissions, and reviewed ADB\u2019s portfolio of projects4 in \nthe three focal countries to identify opportunities for \nincorporating  legal  empowerment  components  into \nmainstream and sector-specific development projects. \nThe review identified criteria that could be used \nto select those activities with the greatest potential to \nact as models for future replication. It also developed \nstrategies  for  integrating  legal  empowerment  com-\nponents. In recommending ADB activities, the review \ntook  account  of  the  intended  beneficiaries,  with  a \nspecial  focus  on  those  projects  with  the  potential \nto  reach  large  beneficiary  populations  of  women, \nespecially poor and vulnerable and/or at-risk women;  \npotential  partnerships,  including  women\u2019s  groups \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs) promoting \ngender equality, women\u2019s departments or ministries, \nor  other  relevant  organizations  and  agencies;  legal \nframework and institutions in which activities will be \nundertaken; government agencies involved; anticipated \nimpacts on vulnerable groups (in particular, the impact \non gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment); stra-\ntegic value of separate sector areas of focus in each of \nthe three countries versus a single target area of focus;  \npractical  operating  gender  inclusive  modalities \nfor  the  legal  empowerment  pilot  initiatives;  and  \nrelevant experience of other multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment agencies, including the United Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP),  World  Bank,  and \nother agencies. \n\nRegional Conference\n\nThe Regional Conference on Legal Empowerment for \nWomen and Disadvantaged Groups was held at ADB \nin Manila on 13\u201314 December 2007. The conference \naimed to enhance understanding of legal empower-\nment,  regional  and  international  practices  in  legal \nempowerment, and challenges and opportunities in  \ndesigning  and  implementing  legal  empowerment \nprojects. The conference was attended by ADB staff, \nmembers of the project team, government officials, \npartner  NGOs,  academics,  and  legal  empowerment \npractitioners from the region and the broader inter-\nnational community. Sessions included presentations; \n\n4  The portfolio of projects refers to current projects in the \n\nearly phase of implementation and those in the pipeline with \npotential interest.\n\nopen discussions; and participatory exercises to facili-\ntate thinking about the design, implementation, and \nassessment of the impact of effective legal empower-\nment  initiatives.  Conference  participants\u2019  feedback \nwas very useful and has shaped this report and other \nproject deliverables. \n\nCapturing Project Lessons  \nin Practical Terms\n\nTo  encourage  local  organizations  and  development \npartners in the focal countries to use legal empower-\nment strategies effectively, it is critical to document and \ndisseminate the project\u2019s key findings in clear, nonlegal \nlanguage.  By  avoiding  the  use  of  legal  terminology, \nADB aims to make it easier for nonlawyers working for \ndomestic legal service providers, development organiza-\ntions, ADB, and other development partners to imple-\nment and integrate the findings and recommendations \nin their future work. \n\nThe  project\u2019s  keys  experiences  are  documented \nin this report as well as a practical handbook, Good \nPractices Guide for Incorporating Legal Empowerment \ninto Operations.\n\nThis  practical  handbook  aims  to  provide  an  \nenhanced understanding of legal empowerment issues \nand practical strategies for developing, implementing, \nand monitoring legal empowerment projects, and to \nthereby advance the goals and impact of sector develop-\nment projects. The handbook begins with a background \nand conceptual framework on legal empowerment that  \n(i)  describes  the  importance  of  legal  empowerment \nand its potential role in advancing the broader devel-\nopment goals of ADB operations; (ii) summarizes the \nconstraints  facing  women  and  other  disadvantaged \ngroups  that  affect  the  quality  of  their  participation \nin development initiatives and the benefits that they \nderive  from  them;  and  (iii)  describes  different  levels \nof  legal  empowerment  interventions  and  ensuing \nbenefits, and the role of legal empowerment in sec-\ntor development initiatives. The handbook then dis-\ncusses the strategic factors for consideration and the  \napproach to follow in designing and implementing a \nlegal empowerment component in a sector develop-\nment project. It uses tables and flow charts to sum-\nmarize the steps to be followed, and provides guidance \non developing and applying rigorous empirical tools to \nmonitor and assess the impact of legal empowerment \n\n\f\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nactivities. Appendixes targeting the specific needs of \nNGOs are attached.\n\nNGOs  undertaking  (or  considering  undertaking) \nlegal empowerment work can use this handbook to \nimprove their understanding of what legal empower-\nment is and how to implement legal empowerment \nstrategies. The handbook focuses on providing prac-\ntical  strategies  for  developing,  implementing,  and \nmonitoring legal empowerment projects. The strate-\n\ngies will help NGOs to advance the goals and impact \nof  sector  development  projects.  The  handbook  also \naims  to  make  it  easier  for  ADB  program  staff  and \ntheir counterparts to work together. It cross-references \nthe factors applied by different organizations in their \nlegal empowerment work, helping to forge effective \nworking  partnerships  and  advancing  the  goals  and \noutcomes of legal empowerment interventions in sec-\ntor development work.\n\n\fDefining the Framework \nof Legal Empowerment \nInitiatives and Measuring \nTheir Impact\n\nThe Challenge of Defining Legal \nEmpowerment \n\nIn  the  last  5  years,  the  development  community  has \nfocused increasing attention on legal empowerment, \na  concept  originating  in  the  specialized  field  of  law. \nThe development community has adopted the concept \ninto  the  broader  development  parlance.  Despite  this \nincreased  attention,  there  is  insufficient  consistency, \nprecision, and clarity about what it means, even among \nnongovernment organization providers of legal empow-\nerment services. \n\nWhile  these  descriptive  features  offer  a  rough \nsketch for understanding the concept of legal empow-\nerment, they do not amount to a concrete definition. \nThe phrase, \u201cI know it when I see it,\u201d famously penned \nby  Justice  Potter  Stewart  of  the  Supreme  Court  of \nthe  United  States  when  considering  whether  some-\nthing was obscene language,5 may aptly describe the \nprocess of finding an appropriate definition for legal \nempowerment.  The  2001  ADB  legal  empowerment \nstudy defined legal empowerment as \u201cthe use of law \nto increase the control that disadvantaged populations \nexercise over their lives.\u201d6 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\nJacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184 (1964). This case, decided in \n1964, held that \u201cnational\u201d standards for obscenity determined \n\u201ccommunity\u201d standards. A Cleveland Heights, Ohio theater \nhad shown a foreign film with an explicit sex scene.\nFootnote 1, p. 7.\n\nThere is general agreement that legal empowerment \nis  broader  than  legal  aid;  it  goes  beyond  individual \ndisputes to address issues at a community level. Legal \nempowerment  often  involves  educating  vulnerable \ngroups about legal rights and processes for accessing \nlegal and administrative remedies. At the same time, \nlegal  empowerment  practitioners  acknowledge  that \neducation alone is not sufficient; legal empowerment \nshould involve opportunities for vulnerable groups to \napply the knowledge and skills imparted to advance \ntheir interests. Finally, the very term \u201clegal empower-\nment\u201d implies that it includes the use of the law, but \nlegal  empowerment  initiatives  frequently  include \nactivities that are not inherently law-oriented, such as \ncommunity organizing or livelihood development. \n\n\f10\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nDuring  the  inception  meeting  for  this  regional \ntechnical  assistance,  the  project  team  determined \nthat  the  2001  definition  would  not  suffice  for  the \npurpose of the project, particularly because this project \ninvolves a rigorous effort to assess the impact of legal \nempowerment initiatives. The team considered that a \nworkable definition needed to be sufficiently concrete \nto provide a solid basis for determining whether the \nproject interventions achieve the desired outcome of \nlegal empowerment. In reviewing the previous defini-\ntion, the project team found the concept of \u201cincreased \ncontrol\u201d particularly troubling for a variety of reasons. \nHaving a sense of control over one\u2019s life is a very subjec-\ntive psychological experience that may be attributed to \na wide range of factors. For example, some people may \nexperience an increased sense of control even if their \nexternal situation has not changed, while others may \nbecome materially better off without an accompanying \nincreased sense of control. Given these ambiguities, the \nproject team was compelled to develop a more tan-\ngible and precise definition that is more closely linked \nto the work of ADB and other international agencies \nand their government counterparts. \n\nThe project defined legal empowerment as \u201cthe \nability  of  women  and  disadvantaged  groups  to  use \nlegal and administrative processes and structures to \naccess  resources,  services,  and  opportunities.\u201d  This \ndefinition  reflected  an  instrumental  view  of  legal \nempowerment, emphasizing its potential to promote \nincreased access to concrete outcomes. During con-\nsultation, some stakeholders expressed concern that \nthis definition was too narrow and might not capture \nall  legal  empowerment-related  issues.  For  example, \nit  was  argued  that  the  current  definition  does  not \ninclude  the  private  sphere  and  therefore  does  not \nextend to domestic violence-related issues. This was a \nvalid concern; however, the definition was developed \nspecifically to monitor and evaluate legal empower-\nment  initiatives  under  ADB  development  projects. \nThe definition may not be all-inclusive and generally \napplicable. But, it serves a particular purpose for this \nproject. Specifically, it provides a basis for measuring \noutcomes to evaluate whether pilot legal empower-\nment  interventions  can  effectively  improve  people\u2019s \nlives in concrete, measurable ways. \n\nThe  monitoring  and  evaluation  methodology  was \ndesigned to measure the impact of the legal empow-\nerment  pilot  initiatives.  There  was  a  particular  \nemphasis on examining whether, in what circumstanc-\nes, and how legal empowerment projects contribute \nto the skills, confidence, and strategies that might be \nexpected  to  improve  governance  and  help  alleviate \npoverty. The evaluation strategy aimed to reach beyond \nthe usual quantifiable measures (such as the number \nof beneficiaries served or cases filed) to examine what, \nif anything, these results added up to in terms of sus-\ntained, concrete improvements in ways people tried to \nengage existing governance standards or improve their \naccess to resources, services, and opportunities.\n\nMeasuring the Impact of  \nLegal Empowerment \n\nAn important feature of the project was the design and \nimplementation of a tailored monitoring and evalua-\ntion (M&E) methodology to compare results between \nsites that received legal empowerment interventions \nand those that did not. \n\nThe  project\u2019s  definition  of  legal  empower-\nment  guided  the  design  of  the  pilot  interventions \nand  provided  the  basis  for  the  M&E  methodol-\nogy.  This  methodology  examined  the  links  bet-\nween  four  mutually-reinforcing  components  of  \nlegal empowerment: confidence, knowledge, strate-\ngies,  and  outcomes.  A  detailed  M&E  protocol  was \ndeveloped to measure the effectiveness of the legal \nempowerment interventions in these four areas. The \nresearch protocol was designed to function in all three \ncountries, while providing enough flexibility to allow \nfor country-specific variations. The challenge was to \nallow for a certain amount of comparability without \nsacrificing the sort of precise analysis that would illumi-\nnate something about the causal connections between \nlegal empowerment and poverty reduction in a particu-\nlar place. To strike a more effective balance between \ncomparability, on the one hand, and causality, on the \nother, a standard survey instrument was developed that \n\n\fDefining the Framework of Legal Empowerment Initiatives and Measuring Their Impact\n\n11\n\ncould be indigenized to capture the unique features of \nthe particular host projects and country contexts. The \nsurvey instrument was also supplemented by in-depth \ninterviews to give a more nuanced picture of how and \nwhy change does or does not occur. \n\nThe M&E protocol allowed for baseline and end-\nof-project data collections.7 This enabled project staff \nto  measure  the  impact  of  the  legal  empowerment \ninterventions over the life of the pilot interventions. It \naimed to understand how respondents change over \ntime, by asking:\n\n(i) \n\nAre respondents aware of the resources, basic \nsocial services, and opportunities available under \nthe ADB loan?\n\n(ii) \n\nAre  respondents  able  to  navigate  the  system \nenvisioned in the ADB loan?\n\n(iii)  Did the pilot project lead respondents to try new \n\nstrategies?\n\n(iv)  Did the respondents\u2019 efforts succeed?\n\nIn each of the three countries, the monitoring and \nevaluation research was conducted in two project sites \nand one comparable control site. The intervention and \ncontrol  sites  were  eligible  to  receive  benefits  under \nthe larger ADB development initiative. But, only the \nintervention  sites  received  the  complementary  legal \nempowerment  activities.  By  comparing  the  survey \nresults  between  project  and  control  locations,  the \nproject team could assess the impact of various legal \nempowerment strategies. \n\nDeveloping the Research Instrument\n\nAfter specifying the basic demographic indicators rela-\nted to gender, education, and household expenditure,  \n\n7 \n\nInitially, a midpoint survey was also scheduled. However, in \nlight of various delays associated with engaging relevant ADB \nproject-specific staff in each country, the midpoint survey was \nskipped (given the overall time frame for the project) in favor \nof a two-stage (beginning and end) design.\n\nthe project team developed the research instrument \nin three basic steps. \n\nStep One\nA series of core questions were drafted to measure: \n(i)  respondent  confidence  (and  the  possibility  of  a \nchange  in  existing  levels  of  confidence  over  time);  \n(ii) respondent strategies (and, again, the possibility of \nchange over time); and (iii) local outcomes\u2014defined \nin terms of a respondent\u2019s access to local services (and \nthe possibility of a change in his/her level of access to \nservices over time). Initially, these core questions were \nframed in general terms to allow for a great deal of \n\u201capplicability\u201d across all three countries. However, after \nconstructing these general questions, the phraseology \nwithin each questionnaire was made more specific to \nenhance the validity of these core questions in each \ncountry context.\n\nStep Two\nEach  country  team  was  asked  to  supply  four  to  six \nquestions focused on specific issues addressed in the \nADB loan documents pertaining to the loan selected \nin  their  country.  These  loan-specific  questions  were \ndesigned  to  assess  whether  local  respondents  had \ncertain types of knowledge about the rights, respon-\nsibilities, obligations, and opportunities outlined in the \nloan document itself. In particular, the project team \nwanted  to  assess  whether  the  legal  empowerment \ninterventions  under  each  pilot  project  succeeded  in \nincreasing the loan-specific knowledge of the target \ncommunity over time.\n\nStep Three\nAn  effort  was  made  to  pair  the  quantitative  survey \ninstrument  with  some  supplementary  qualitative \ninterviews. The project team was particularly keen to \nshow that, even when the survey instrument was used \neffectively, the bare statistics would not necessarily re-\nport on some of the more illuminating information that \nwas collected. For instance, the project team wanted \nto show that when a particular respondent selected \nresponse code 3 in response to question 14, certain \ntypes of explanations and/or justifications may have \nbeen offered to explain why response code 3 seemed \n\n\f1\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nlike  the  best  response.  These  explanations  and/or \njustifications  helped  the  project  team  understand \nexactly what response code 3 meant to the respon-\ndent. Supplementary qualitative interviews sought to \ncapture some of this missing qualitative data in some \ninstances.\n\nValidating the Research Instrument  \nand Training the Interviewers\nRigorous  evaluations  are  not  ordinarily  conducted \nin  conjunction  with  legal  empowerment  initiatives. \nCapacity to design and implement sophisticated M&E \nprotocols  is  usually  limited.  Prior  to  conducting  the \nbaseline surveys, training workshops were held in all \nthree countries. \n\nSessions focused on (i) surveyors\u2019 understanding \nof the questionnaires; (ii) appropriate behavior when \nconducting a survey (for example, explaining that there \nis no right answer and/or ensuring that interviewers \nsimply ask about local views, opinions, and experiences \n\nwithout any preconceived notions about what those \nviews,  opinions,  or  experiences  should  be);  (iii) the \nimportance  of  demonstrating  respect  toward  inter-\nviewees (especially interviewees who might otherwise \nbe  inclined  to  see  themselves  as  subordinates);  and  \n(iv) the need to be sensitive during interviews. \n\nResearch consultants conducted interview simula-\ntions and tested questionnaires for possible misunder-\nstandings, unclear questions, validity gaps (owing to \ncross-national context), and ambiguous terms.\n\nImplementing the Monitoring  \nand Evaluation Methodology\n\nAppendix 3 presents the findings of the M&E meth-\nodology in an M&E report. The report documents the \ndata collection process, challenges encountered and \nhow they were addressed, findings and results, and \nrecommendations for the design and implementation \nof future M&E methodologies.\n\n\fPilot Projects\n\nIn each of the three project countries, the project team \ndeveloped and implemented a pilot legal empowerment \ninitiative  under  an  existing  ADB  sector  development \nproject.  The  legal  empowerment  interventions  were \nspecifically  designed  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of \nthe larger development projects, particularly in terms \nof  their  positive  impact  on  the  lives  of  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups. Each one of the pilot projects \nwas implemented in partnership with a local nongov-\nernment organization (NGO), which coordinated with \nrelevant  stakeholders,  including  local-level  officials, \ncommunity members, and ADB project staff. \n\nThe sections below provide detailed descriptions \nof  the  legal  empowerment  initiatives  implemented \nin Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan. The descrip-\ntions provide an overview of the ADB host projects, \nobjectives  of  the  legal  empowerment  interventions, \nimplementing  partner  organizations,  range  of  legal \nempowerment activities, achievements, and challenges \nencountered.\n\nBangladesh\n\nADB Host Project Overview\n\nThe  Second  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Develop-\nment Sector Project (SSSWRDSP)8 was selected as the \nhost  project  for  the  legal  empowerment  pilot  initia-\ntive  in  Bangladesh.  The  SSSWRDSP\u2019s  overall  goal  is \nto  support  the  Government  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  poverty \nreduction  efforts  by  increasing  sustainable  agricul-\nture  and  fishery  production.  The  SSSWRDSP  aims  to \ndevelop  sustainable,  stakeholder-driven,  small-scale \n\n8  ADB. 2001b.

To \nfurther  this  objective,  the  SSSWRDSP  undertakes  the \nfollowing activities: (i) mobilizing beneficiary participa-\ntion;  (ii)  developing  community-based  infrastructure \n(flood  management,  drainage  improvement,  water \nconservation,  and  command  area  development);  \n(iii) developing support programs for water resources; \n(iv) implementing monitoring and quality control sys-\ntems and procedures; and (v) institutional strengthening \nof the small-scale water resources sector. The SSSWRDSP \noperates in 61 out of Bangladesh\u2019s 64 districts. \n\nObjectives of the Legal Empowerment \nInterventions\n\nThe Asia Foundation\u2019s project team and ADB counter-\nparts identified the SSSWRDSP as a suitable host project \nin which a legal empowerment pilot component could \nbe integrated because of its special focus on vulnerable \ncommunities,  including  women  and  disadvantaged \ngroups.  These  groups  are  expected  to  participate  in \nestablishing  sustainable,  stakeholder-driven  water \nresource management systems. However, this has pre-\nsented a challenge, given that these groups have limited \n\n\f1\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\ncapacity to understand their rights and to access institu-\ntional mechanisms. The limitations are attributed mainly \nto violence against women and disadvantaged groups, \nas  well  as  their  lack  of  participation  in  organizations  \nfocused on sustainable infrastructure management. Legal \nempowerment could potentially enhance SSSWRDSP\u2019s  \neffectiveness  in  reaching  targeted  beneficiaries  by  \naddressing  relevant  constraints,  including  limitations \non women\u2019s rights, low stakeholder participation, and \nweak governance mechanisms.\n\nLocal Partnerships\n\nAin O Shalish Kendra (ASK) was the principal imple-\nmenting partner for the legal empowerment pilot proj-\nect. Since 1986, ASK has been a key service provider \nand human rights activist in Bangladesh. It provides \nfree legal aid to the disenfranchised and takes on class- \naction cases in defense of human rights. ASK advocates \na nonpartisan approach to human rights. Its programs \nseek to promote community activism, access to jus-\ntice, accountability, and good governance. Although \na number of development partners provide financial \nsupport for ASK\u2019s programs, ASK is working toward \nindependent program sustainability through a variety \nof  strategies,  including  training  programs,  publica-\ntion  sales,  and  the  provision  of  expert  services.  The \nthematic program priorities of ASK are to (i) promote \ncommunity activism for gender, social justice, and hu-\nman rights; (ii) increase access to justice; (iii) ensure \naccountability  and  good  governance;  (iv) monitor \nthe  human  rights  situation;  and  (v) ensure  effective \nprogram management. \n\nThe stakeholder organization selected as the main \nbeneficiary of the legal empowerment pilot interven-\ntions was the Water Management Cooperative Associa-\ntion (WMCA). The WMCA is responsible for managing  \nthe water infrastructure constructed by the host proj-\nect.  Members  are  appointed  when  the  SSSWRDSP \nestablishes  a  presence  in  a  community  and  receive \nsome degree of training from the host project. After \nsome time, formal elections are held, and an elected \ncommittee is established for a fixed term of service. \nThe WMCA serves as a link between the SSSWRDSP \nand  the  broader  community  of  beneficiaries,  and  is \nintended to serve as a focal point for community inputs \nin project implementation.\n\nLegal Empowerment Activities\n\nThe pilot project was implemented in the Mymensingh \nDistrict,  with  a  particular  focus  on  three  SSSWRDSP \nsites.  Baseline  data  collection  and  project  activities \nwere conducted in two local project sites that take their \nname  from  the  local  water  system:  Veki  Beel,  Sadar \nand Govia Beel, Iswargonj. A third project site served \nas a control area in which baseline and follow-up data \ncollections were taken, but no program activities were \nimplemented. A baseline survey undertaken at the be-\nginning of the project found that there was insufficient \nknowledge among the WMCA members regarding their \ngeneral rights as citizens and their rights and respon-\nsibilities as WMCA members. This was a key constraint \nto the pilot project. To address this, the pilot project \nran training, legal awareness forums, and issue-based \ndrama presentations. The pilot project also conducted \nfollow-up visits and coordinated meetings. \n\nTraining\nThe training programs focused on human rights, gen-\nder,  family  law,  combating  violence  against  women, \nmediation,  and  the  operation  of  village  courts.  The \nvillage court is a legal dispute resolution forum run by \na chairperson and members of the union parishad, the \nlowest tier of elected local government in Bangladesh. \nThe  main  objectives  of  the  training  sessions  were  to  \n(i)  provide  basic  information,  (ii)  enhance  the  par-\nticipants\u2019 capacity to disseminate information to other \nmembers of the WMCA, (iii) promote a gender-sensitive \napproach to implementing the WMCA\u2019s activities, and \n(iv) integrate  the  training  materials  into  the  WMCA\u2019s \ncore activities. The training ran for 4 days, and 25 par-\nticipants  attended  each  session,  with  equal  numbers \nof men and women attending. The training program \nprimarily targeted managing committee members and \nother senior members of the WMCA. It was expected \nthat participants would share their experience with the \nbroader membership of the WMCA and the community \nat large with follow-up interaction. Training was also \nprovided on WMCA rules, regulations, leadership, and \nmanagement.  Refresher  training  sessions  provided \nmore  in-depth  information  on  all  topics  and  were \nheld  for  those  managing  committee  members  who \nexhibited leadership qualities. At the end of the pilot \nproject, a train-the-trainers program was organized to \n\n\fsustain the project activities in the project intervention \nareas.  Twenty-five  participants  (12  from  Govia  and  \n13 from Veki Beel) were handpicked for the 4-day train- \nthe-trainers session.\n\nLegal Awareness Forum\nMere training is insufficient to ensure that people fully \nappreciate and accept their legal rights and therefore \nenforce them. For this reason, the project team created \nlegal  awareness  forums  to  generate  more  in-depth \nskills  development.  The  forums  focused  on  increas-\ning  participants\u2019  awareness  about  the  procedures \nand  available  resources  for  accessing  justice.  Twelve \nlegal awareness forums were conducted in the project  \nintervention areas\u2014each WMCA area had six forums. A \nmember from the relevant district court bar association \nwas invited to attend each forum and act as a resource \nperson. In a typical session, members of the WMCA and \nbroader community discussed their respective problems. \nThe  lawyer  provided  free  advice  and  explained  the \nprocedure for accessing justice. Information was also \nprovided on local NGOs offering legal aid clinics as well \nas the Government of Bangladesh\u2013supported Legal Aid \nFund, which has been underutilized\u2014probably because \npeople do not properly understand its function. \n\nIssue-Based Drama Presentation\nIssue-based  drama  presentations  were  conducted \nin  the  project  implementation  areas  to  increase  the \ngeneral  population\u2019s  rights\u2019  awareness.  Popular  the-\nater is a useful tool for making issues accessible and \nengaging  the  audience  in  a  participatory  dialogue \non  the  direction  of  the  story  line.  The  presentations \nwere intended to increase awareness by providing an \nopen  forum  for  community  members  to  discuss  and \ndebate important issues. The presentations addressed \na  diverse  range  of  issues,  including  rights  violations, \nunlawful  shalish9  (mediation),  wife  beating,  oral  di-\nvorce, illegal water management, and early marriage. \n\nPilot Projects\n\n1\u0018\n\nThey also integrated concepts such as the rights and \nobligations  of  the  WMCA  members,  participatory  \ndecision  making,  and  democratic  governance.  Six \npresentations  were  held  in  each  of  the  two  project \nintervention areas. Thousands of people attended the \npresentations,  and  while  the  majority  of  participants \nwere men, women constituted 30\u201340% of attendees. \nIt was significant that so many women attended the \npresentations because the project implementation areas \nwere  mostly  located  in  rural  areas,  where  traditional \nvalues  tend  to  limit  women\u2019s  participation  in  public \nevents. The high female participation rate also reflects \nthe goodwill that ASK program staff have established in \nthe community and shows that they have been success-\nful in their efforts to encourage women to participate \nin the community. It also indicates that male household \nheads are prepared to allow women to participate in \nthe presentations and other program activities.\n\nFollow-Up Visits\nOne month after the training sessions were completed, \nproject staff conducted follow-up visits in both of the \nWMCA  locations  targeted.  The  project  organizer  or \ntrainer met with and interviewed workshop participants \nto gauge how much information they had retained and \nwhat initiatives they had undertaken. These sessions also \nprovided ongoing support to training participants. \n\nCoordination Meetings\nTwo coordination meetings were held in the working \nareas. The meetings were attended by local elites, local \ngovernment representatives, general members of the \nWMCAs,  managing  committee  members,  local  NGO \nrepresentatives,  and  representatives  from  the  Local \nGovernment  Engineering  Department.  The  meetings \nwere designed to educate participants about the WMCA \nand its activities, and develop cooperative relationships \nbetween the WMCA and other participants. \n\nAchievements and Challenges\n\n9 \n\nThe term \u201cshalish\u201d refers to a community-based, largely informal \nBangladeshi process through which small panels of influential \nlocal figures help resolve community members\u2019 disputes and/or \nimpose of sanctions on them: Golub, S. 2003. Non\u00adState Justice \nSystems in Bangladesh and the Philippines. Paper prepared for \nthe United Kingdom Department for International Development. \nAvailable: http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTJUSFORPOOR/\nResources/GolubNonStateJusticeSystems.pdf\n\nInitial Observations\nAlthough it is difficult to assess the long-term impact \nof  this  short  pilot  project,  there  are  indications  that \nsome  progress  was  made  in  meeting  the  intended \nobjectives. In the pilot project sites, there was a notice-\nable increase in the number of people attending the \n\n\f1\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nWMCAs\u2019 meetings and forums, particularly women. In \nproject intervention areas, the project increased people\u2019s \nconfidence  to  approach  the  WMCA  management \ncommittees independently, especially among women. \nThere  was  also  a  large  reduction  in  the  percentage \nof women who had previously found it impossible to  \napproach the WMCAs\u2014exactly the opposite is observed \nin control areas. \n\nThe  program  interventions  improved  people\u2019s \nunderstanding about their legal rights. For example, \npeople  in  the  program  intervention  villages  demon-\nstrated a far better understanding of their eligibility to \njoin the local WMCA compared with those villagers in \nthe control districts. People in the program intervention \nvillages also had an improved understanding of the \nmaintenance costs related to specific types of water \ninfrastructure. Although people in the control villages \nhad a reasonable knowledge about water infrastruc-\nture maintenance costs, the project surveys revealed \ngaps in that knowledge\u2014the villagers answered \u201cdon\u2019t \nknow\u201d more frequently in the project surveys. This sug-\ngests that program intervention villages significantly \nbenefited from the pilot-project training sessions. \n\nThere were better rates of loan recovery (micro-\ncredit) because more members repaid their loans. In \nthe past, its general members overwhelmingly viewed \nthe  WMCA  as  mere  vehicles  of  credit  delivery,  but \nthe  members  now  have  a  deeper  understanding  of \nthe  WMCA\u2019s  multiple  functions.  As  they  developed \nan understanding of the WMCA\u2019s multiple functions, \ngeneral  members  started  asking  questions  about \nits  operations.  By  the  end  of  the  pilot  project,  even  \nissues like financial management, which the managing \ncommittees  rarely  discussed  with  general  members, \nwere  discussed  in  the  meetings.  These  discussions \nhelped  to  allay  the  general  members\u2019  doubts  and \nsuspicions about the WMCA. In addition, the general \nmembers and the managing committee of the local \nWMCAs collaborated to develop a work plan for future \nactivities. \n\nThe  pilot  project  also  contributed  to  improved \nknowledge and protection of women\u2019s rights. In the \nprogram  intervention  areas,  the  WMCAs\u2019  general \nmembers  commenced  documenting  the  number  of \ncomplaints made about rights violations. This suggests \nthat the female general members had a growing under-\nstanding of their rights and how to deal with rights vio-\nlations. In program intervention areas, there was also a \n\nlarge increase in the percentage of people who thought \nthat the WMCAs were the first court of appeal regarding \nwater-related problems. In control areas, there was a \nsignificantly smaller increase in people\u2019s understanding \nof the importance of the WMCAs and their rights in \nrelation  to  them.  In  particular,  the  survey  instrument \nindicated that women in control areas demonstrated a \nlower understanding of their rights or the potential for \nthem to use their WMCA to vent grievances.\n\nAt  their  own  initiative,  the  members  created  \nhuman rights violation prevention committees to deal \nwith  rights  violations.  These  committees  also  took \nthe initiative to use mediation to deal with conflict. \nASK received regular feedback on the activities of the  \nhuman  rights  violation  prevention  committees,  \ntogether with appeals for assistance. \n\nChallenges\nStaffing presented a significant challenge to the legal \nempowerment pilot project. There were limited num-\nbers of staff members allocated for project implemen-\ntation.  Staffing  was  also  logistically  difficult  because \nof the project\u2019s short duration and the geographically \nremote  location  of  the  WMCAs  participating  in  the \npilot initiative. \n\nThere  were  some  gaps  in  understanding  levels \nbetween the stakeholders involved, probably caused \nby  difficulties  experienced  in  coordinating  activities \nbetween  the  host  project  and  pilot  legal  empower-\nment  initiative.  The  coordination  difficulties  may  be \nattributed to the different operating styles of the host \nproject (implemented by a government agency) and \nthe legal empowerment pilot initiative (implemented \nby  the  partner  NGO,  ASK).  This  difficulty  highlights \nthe need for regular consultation between the legal \nempowerment implementing agency and host project \nprincipals  at  headquarters  and  in  the  field.  Regular \ncommunication between the NGO legal service part-\nner and its government counterparts facilitates better \nunderstanding and trust between representatives of \ntwo sectors that have historically tended to operate \nindependently of one another\u2014an essential first step \nin forging effective public\u2013private partnerships. ADB \nhost  project  personnel  played  an  important  role  in \nfacilitating dialogue between ASK and its government \ncounterparts.\n\nConflict  arises  during  most  projects,  particu-\nlarly between community members and government \n\n\fPilot Projects\n\n1\u0018\n\nagencies.  In  the  pilot  project,  the  WMCAs\u2019  general \nmembers gained a clearer understanding of the rel-\nevant  administrative  procedures  and  expectations \nconcerning  their  rights  as  members  and/or  broader \nbeneficiaries.  Consequently,  by  the  end  of  the  pilot \nproject,  the  general  members  began  asking  ques-\ntions  about  the  WMCAs\u2019  operations.  However,  the \nmanaging committees tended to see these questions \nas an interference with their right to manage the af-\nfairs of the WMCAs. This conflict represents tension \nbetween ordinary citizens and local elites, who typi-\ncally occupy seats on local management or community  \ndecision-making bodies by virtue of their status and \ninfluence in the community. It is important to manage \nthis power dynamic in legal empowerment projects. \nFuture  legal  empowerment  activities  must  carefully \nconsider these local power dynamics when reviewing \nthe  project  environment,  defining  challenges,  and \nassessing the impact of program interventions. Other-\nwise, legal empowerment projects risk being hindered \nby sour relationships between local elites, in their rep-\nresentative or local decision-making capacity, and the \nbroader community of project beneficiaries. This might \nbe the case even if the activities strengthen relations \nbetween  local  committees  and  other  representative \nbodies and government counterparts.\n\nIndonesia\n\nADB Host Project Overview \n\nThe  Neighborhood  Upgrading  and  Shelter  Sector \nProject (NUSSP)10 was selected as the host project for \nthe  legal  empowerment  pilot  initiative  in  Indonesia. \nThe  NUSSP  loan  stresses  the  importance  of  ensuring \nthat  neighborhood  committees  are  formed  and  par-\nticipate in documenting and channeling local demand \nfor household and neighborhood improvements. The \nNUSSP  works  toward  providing  affordable  housing \nand  serviced  land  to  the  poor.  To  accomplish  this \nobjective, NUSSP focuses on (i) improving low-income \nurban  families\u2019  access  to  tenure  and  serviced  plots;  \n\n(ii) improving low-income urban families\u2019 opportunities to  \nupgrade  existing  housing  and  acquire  new  housing;  \n(iii)  providing  appropriate  financing  for  shelter  and \nother services; and (iv) arranging for low-income com-\nmunities, local governments, the National Land Agency, \nfinancing  institutions,  and  the  Executing  Agency  to \nparticipate in a pro-poor shelter provision and financ-\ning system. \n\nThe  NUSSP  is  extensive  in  scope.  It  has  project \nsites  located  in  a  total  of  32  local  governments  in \nSulawesi (15), Java (9), Kalimantan (1), and Sumatra \n(7). Its ultimate goal is to promote the development \nof a favorable policy, institutional, and regulatory en-\nvironment that meets the pressing housing needs of \nvulnerable citizens. Thus, the NUSSP works to allevi-\nate poverty, promote good governance, and improve \nhealth  through  better  living  conditions  for  targeted \nbeneficiaries.\n\nObjectives of the Legal Empowerment \nIntervention \n\nThe project team and ADB counterparts jointly identi-\nfied  NUSSP  as  a  suitable  project  for  a  supplemental \nlegal empowerment component because to access the \nproject\u2019s  benefits,11  beneficiaries  must  navigate\u2014i.e. \na range of administrative institutions and procedures. \nThe  project\u2019s  success  depends  on  local  committees, \ngovernmental officials, and ordinary citizens having the \nknowledge, skills, capacity, and confidence to partici-\npate effectively in the project\u2019s overarching structures \nand regulations. \n\nThe legal empowerment pilot project focused on \nstrengthening the capacity of low-income communi-\nties to understand the procedures and requirements \nfor  accessing  benefits  available  under  the  NUSSP. \nLegal  empowerment  interventions  concentrated  on \ntraining.  Some  training  sessions  aimed  at  enhanc-\ning the effectiveness of community-driven planning. \nOther courses examined the rights, responsibilities, and  \nopportunities frequently contained in loan documents, \nwith a special emphasis placed on land entitlements \nand reallocation requirements. \n\n10  ADB. 2003b. Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the Republic of \nIndonesia for the Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector \nProject. \n\n11  The NUSSP\u2019s benefits include, for example, funds to upgrade \nhousing and neighborhood infrastructure, such as access \nroads.\n\n\f1\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nThe legal empowerment pilot project was imple-\nmented  in  two  poor  urban  neighborhoods  in  the \ncity of Makassar in South Sulawesi: Pattingaloan and \nRappokaling. A third control area was designated for \nthe baseline and post pilot project research, but no \nproject interventions.\n\nLocal Partnerships\n\nThe main partner for the NUSSP legal empowerment \ninitiative was the Indonesian Women\u2019s Association for \nJustice  (APIK).  Established  in  August  1995,  APIK  has \nplayed a prominent role in the fight for gender justice \nin  Indonesia.  Arguably,  APIK  pioneered  the  concept \nof  gender  and  transformative  legal  aid  in  Indonesia. \nAPIK provides legal aid to women who are victimized \nby violence and discrimination, and it actively engages \nin legal advocacy, training, and research projects. APIK \nhas established a robust network with other women\u2019s \norganizations and has created its own legal self-help \ngroups for female survivors of violence. \n\nThe  success  of  the  current  legal  empowerment \ninitiative  was  largely  because  of  APIK\u2019s  efforts  to \nestablish  a  supportive,  mutually  beneficial  relation-\nship  with  NUSSP  staff,  especially  oversight  commit-\ntee  members.  For  example,  training  materials  were \ndeveloped  through  a  close  collaboration  between \nAPIK and NUSSP, and NUSSP staff attended all train-\ning sessions.\n\nLegal Empowerment Activities\n\nThe overarching objective of the legal empowerment \ninitiative  was  to  empower  community-based  organi-\nzations to use legal and administrative procedures to \nadvance  their  rights,  both  under  the  NUSSP  and  the \nbroader  community.  The  legal  empowerment  pilot \nproject  sought  to  increase  disadvantaged  communi-\nties\u2019 knowledge of their rights relating to the NUSSP\u2019s \nbenefits, such as land entitlement. More importantly, \nhowever,  the  legal  empowerment  activities  aimed  to \ngive beneficiaries the skills, confidence, and knowledge \nnecessary to protect their rights. \n\nAPIK implemented the legal empowerment pilot \nproject via its local chapter in Makassar, APIK Makas-\nsar. For the pilot initiative, APIK focused on two key \nissues: land certificates, an important element of the \nNUSSP  host  project;  and  domestic  violence,  which \n\nwas an issue experienced by women in the neighbor-\nhoods served by NUSSP that could affect the quality \nof  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  project  and  other \ncommunity development initiatives. Members of local  \nneighborhood improvement committees (BKMs)12 in \nRappokaling  and  Pattingaloan  identified  domestic \nviolence  as  a  gender  issue  of  particular  concern  to \ntheir  neighborhoods.  In  fact,  BKM  officers  played  a \ncombination of community support roles beyond their \nofficial scope of work as specified by NUSSP, by virtue \nof the stature and respect that they enjoyed in their \ncommunities. In this capacity, they were periodically \nrequested to resolve domestic violence problems and \nother community issues, but they lacked a thorough \nunderstanding of legal protections and support mech-\nanism to which they could refer women victims from \ntheir communities. In addition, while the intended pilot \nproject beneficiaries were women and disadvantaged \ngroups, it became apparent to the APIK team that BKM \nmembers  did  not  fully  understand  how  to  navigate \nthe  project\u2019s  administrative  requirements.  Accord-\ningly, project activities were modified to target both \nBKM members and the community at large, meaning \nthat the pilot project\u2019s public campaigns component \nreached  almost  all  community  members  in  the  two \nneighborhoods. The considerable range and scope of \nADB\u2019s  and  APIK\u2019s  legal  empowerment  activities  are \nhighlighted below.\n\nBriefings and Trainings\nAs  part  of  legal  empowerment  pilot  project,  APIK \nconducted  a  series  of  initial  meetings  with  various \nstakeholders. It coordinated with the NUSSP local imple-\nmentation office of Makassar and informed the local \ngovernment of Makassar about their work. APIK met \nwith the sub-district and neighborhood heads to secure \npermission to conduct the pilot project. As a result of \nthese meetings, APIK secured the necessary permits to \nconduct legal empowerment trainings for BKM officers, \nsocial mapping, and baseline and post-project assess-\nment  surveys  in  both  neighborhoods.  The  meetings \nprovided the APIK team with detailed information on \nthe implementation of NUSSP and an understanding of \nthe legal and gender related problems that could have \nan impact on NUSSP, including land disputes, incidents \n\n12  BKMs were established to serve as a link between the NUSSP \n\nand the local communities.\n\n\fof land seizure, domestic violence, lack of community \nknowledge of support mechanisms for dispute resolu-\ntion and domestic violence prevention, and inadequate \nknowledge of the steps to be followed in arranging land \nownership certificates.\n\nTraining for Community Committee Members.  APIK \ndeveloped training materials and organized three train-\ning sessions on major legal empowerment issues for \nBKM members. The BKM training sessions addressed \na  variety  of  issues,  including  (i)  the  role  of  gender \nsensitivity  and  gender  issues  in  community  develop-\nment projects, conducted on 26\u201327 May 2007; (ii) an \noverview and explanation of BKM and NUSSP regula-\ntions,  conducted  on  12\u201313  June  2007;  and  (iii)  the \nvalue  of  critical  legal  thinking,  conducted  on  22\u201323 \nSeptember  2007.  The  third  theme  encouraged  par-\nticipants to reflect on their understanding of relevant \nlaws  and  their  relationship  with  the  legal  system.  It \nalso encouraged participants to consider whether they \nwere able to enforce their legal rights or gain access \nto benefits in a manner that was consistent with the \nlaw\u2019s  intended  purpose.  BKM  training  on  gender  is-\nsues and critical legal thinking covered gender-based \nviolence,  including  domestic  violence.  The  training \naimed to raise understanding that domestic violence \nis a human rights violation, that the laws of Indonesia \nprohibit domestic violence, and that APIK and other \ncivil  society  organizations  can  be  called  on  to  assist \nvictims of domestic violence.\n\nCommunity  Meetings  for  Members  of  Commu-\nnity Committees.  After the training sessions for BKM \nmembers, APIK organized bimonthly meetings at the \ncommunity\u2019s BKM office to ensure that training materi-\nals were clear and applicable to their daily activities. \n\nMedia Campaigns\nThe  pilot  project  undertook  a  knowledge  campaign \nthat  encompassed  both  print  and  broadcast  media \ncomponents. APIK hosted six radio programs between \nJuly  and  September  2007,  which  provided  crucial \ninformation  to  disadvantaged  groups,  people  living \nin  remote  areas,  and  illiterate  individuals.  APIK  also \nprinted  leaflets  for  distribution  after  Friday  prayers \nand in women\u2019s group meetings. These materials ad-\ndressed a range of issues, including property rights, \ngender equality, child protection laws, anti-domestic \n\nPilot Projects\n\n19\n\nviolence law, participation and active citizenship, and \nthe environment. \n\nVisit to City of Makassar National  \nLand Agency Office\nThe pilot project arranged for a group to visit the City \nof Makassar Land Agency Office (BPN). The delegation \nincluded  members  from  the  subdistrict  administra-\ntions and BKM officers. The exercise aimed to provide \nparticipants with (i) greater confidence when dealing \nwith BPN in the future; (ii) a better understanding of \nBPN\u2019s  procedures,  which  are  generally  regarded  as  \nintimidating for the uninitiated; and (iii) new strategies \nfor dealing with problems. During the visit, participants \nraised  concerns  about  (i)  the  length  of  time  needed \nto arrange certificates; (ii) problems with various BPN \nstaff, who are irresponsible when handling certificate \napplications; (iii) BPN\u2019s highly bureaucratic procedure; \n(iv) residents\u2019 poor understanding about obtaining land \ncertificates; and (v) the lack of clarity regarding fees. \nBPN acknowledged these concerns and discussed the \nprocess for obtaining a certificate. \n\nBPN  showed  the  delegation  the  various  stages \ninvolved in the certificate handling process and what \nwindows to approach for collecting forms. Delegates \nwere warned to check that the person who was pro-\nviding  services  at  each  window  was  the  designated \nofficer. BPN lists the name of the designated officer on \na nameplate above each window. By checking these \ndetails, residents can prevent files from being taken \nby someone who is not the designated officer. This is \nimportant because if the person providing the services \nis not the designated officer, the resident is responsible \nfor the possible loss of the files or other mishaps. \n\nBPN  will  follow  up  on  complaints  made  by  the \ndelegation regarding certain BPN personnel who had \nmishandled certificates. \n\nSocial Mapping Exercise\nThe  pilot  project  team  undertook  a  social  mapping \nexercise to collect data to help with designing solutions \naimed at giving poor residents access to resources avail-\nable under the NUSSP and other social programs, such \nas obtaining low-cost land certificates. \n\nTwo  community  meetings  were  held  in  each  of \nthe two project neighborhoods to discuss the forma-\ntion  of  social  mapping  teams  and  clarify  roles  and \nresponsibilities in carrying out the mapping exercise. \n\n\f\u00180\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nThe  mapping  exercise  collected  the  following  data \nabout households: \n\n(i) \n\nname of the head of household;\n\n(ii) \n\nhousehold address;\n\n(iii) \n\nneighborhood/citizen association;\n\n(iv) \n\ngender of household members;\n\n(v) \n\nnumber of family members;\n\n(vi) \n\nlegal source of land occupation, that is, whether \nthe  household  occupies  the  land  by  way  of \ngrant, purchase, inheritance, etc.;\n\n(vii) \n\nland ownership status (deed of sale, ownership \ntitle certificate, right to use certificate, etc.);\n\n(viii) \n\nland area; and\n\n(ix) \n\nhousehold income.\n\nThe  mapping  teams  also  held  several  meeting \nwith  subdistrict  administrators  and  representatives \nfrom the land agency, who undertook to ensure that \nthe data would be used to promote the interests of \npoor residents. In particular, the administrative head \nof Tallo District guaranteed to use the mapping data to \nprepare a proposal for a free or low-cost certification \nprogram  designed  to  cover  poor  residents  who  are \nnot currently being covered for home repairs through \nthe NUSSP.\n\nAchievements and Challenges\n\nWhile it is too early to tell whether local stakehold-\ners will continue their work beyond the term of the \npilot project, the initial results are positive. Following \neach  training  session,  APIK  collated  comments  and \npost-training survey data to assess participants\u2019 under-\nstanding of the publicity campaigns. The signs were \nencouraging,  suggesting  that  legal  empowerment \nassistance generated significant outputs. Participants \nfrequently  praised  the  legal  empowerment  pilot  for \nproviding relevant information that could be imme-\ndiately used. \n\nGiven time and resource constraints, the pilot legal \nempowerment project place primary emphasis on BKM \nofficers as key interlocutors, complemented by broader \noutreach  to  NUSSP  communities  through  media \ncampaigns. BKM officers clearly benefitted from the \nknowledge acquired through the training programs, \nand can be counted on to draw on this knowledge in \nsupporting community members that face domestic \nviolence and other forms of gender-based violence and \nin resolving legal problems that can affect the benefits \nthat citizens draw from NUSSP and other development \ninitiatives. Future legal empowerment projects should \nideally  combine  similar  training  of  key  interlocutors \nand direct community engagement on a greater scale \nthrough information campaigns, community meetings, \nand other outreach activities.\n\nFinally, the project significantly enhanced APIK\u2019s \ncapacity to undertake future legal empowerment pro-\ngrams of this kind to complement work specific devel-\nopment sectors. As a result of the legal empowerment \npilot project, APIK Makassar now has the capacity to \nconduct surveys for accurate data collection. APIK has \nalso increased its access to poor urban communities \nand  strengthened  its  communication  and  outreach \nnetwork, which has been expanded to include local \ngovernment officials. \n\nThe pilot project\u2019s main challenges were logistical. \nThe  project  involved  a  wide  range  of  parties  across \na  number  of  geographic  locations.  Thus,  the  team \nneeded  to  coordinate  the  various  parties  involved \nin  the  project.  The  Foundation\u2019s  Indonesia  Office \nserved a facilitative role by liaising with local NUSSP \nstaff.  However,  future  projects  could  be  strength-\nened  by  increased  collaboration  with  national-level  \nNUSSP staff. \n\nThe  ongoing  design  of  the  NUSSP  could  be \nimproved by providing more employment opportuni-\nties for urban poor communities, particularly for the \ndevelopment of neighborhood infrastructure. Urban \npoor communities generally provided voluntary labor, \nwhile official contractors were paid by the project. The \nNUSSP would have a greater impact on the lives of \nvulnerable groups if it could provide partial payment \nto local communities for their labor contributions. \n\nADB\u2019s core objective for the NUSSP pilot project \nwas  to  ensure  that  its  planning  and  execution  was \nas participatory as possible. Nevertheless, the project \ncould be strengthened by developing materials specifi-\n\n\fPilot Projects\n\n\u00181\n\ncally tailored to helping urban poor communities, tak-\ning account of their particular needs and constraints. \nFor example, poor education standards are a pervasive \nproblem  that  requires  special  strategies  for  sharing \ninformation  in  ways  that  are  easily  understood  and \napplied.  Women\u2019s  participation  in  the  project  was \nextremely low. To combat this, the project could set a \nminimum participation level for minority groups and \nwomen (toward an optimal target of 50%, with initial \ntargets in the range of 25\u201335%). The minimum partici-\npation level could be determined in consultation with \nleaders of these two critical target groups. This would \nensure genuine participation by all groups and avoid \nthe token participation that has occurred in the past. \n\nPakistan\n\nADB Host Project Overview \n\nThe  Sindh  Devolved  Social  Services  Program  (DSSP)13 \nwas selected as Pakistan\u2019s host project. The DSSP aims \nto increase access to basic social services, particularly for \nwomen and other disadvantaged groups. It helps local \ngovernments improve their delivery of social services in \nthe areas of education, health, water, and sanitation. \nThe overarching goal of the DSSP is to reduce poverty \nand gender inequality. \n\nObjectives of the Legal Empowerment \nIntervention\n\nWhile the DSSP project covers a broad range of issues \nand  geographic  locations,  the  legal  empowerment \ninitiative focused on the issue of basic health care. The \npilot  project  was  conducted  in  Union  Council  6  and \nMirwah in the Mirpurkhas District, Sindh, using Union \nCouncil Kherao as a control site.\n\nThe DSSP loan documents outline a process un-\nder which local health monitoring committees play a \nkey role in monitoring the work of local health care \nproviders and ensuring the availability of medical pro-\nfessionals and supplies. These and other social sector \n\nmonitoring  committees  were  formed  in  accordance \nwith  the  Sindh  Local  Government  Ordinance,  with \nmembership from the Zila Council in the case of dis-\ntricts. The functions of the committees combine, inter \nalia, reporting on district target achievements, respon-\nsiveness to difficulties faced by citizens, efficiency in \nservice delivery, and transparent functioning. Although \nhealth monitoring committees have been formally es-\ntablished in the Mirpurkhas District at the district and \nunion  level,  they  have  not  proactively  improved  the \npoor state of health care in the region. In fact, many \nrespondents interviewed were completely unaware of \nthe health monitoring committees\u2019 existence. \n\nIn  conjunction  with  the  Aurat  Publication  and  \nInformation  Service  Foundation  (Aurat  Foundation), \nADB  sought  to  strengthen  the  health  monitoring \ncommittees\u2019 capacity to monitor state-provided health \nservices. The Aurat Foundation developed strategies \nby which the health monitoring committees could im-\nprove their interaction with local government officials \nat the union council level, and provide better quality \nbasic  health  services  to  women  and  disadvantaged \ngroups. The aim was to ensure that women and dis-\nadvantaged groups realized the full benefits intended \nfor them under the project. By supporting the health \nmonitoring committees and educating them on their \nrole, obligations, and opportunities, it was anticipated \nthat target populations would enjoy increased access \nto local decision makers and effective avenues by which \nto assert their rights under the project. \n\nAccountability  for  service  delivery  was  a  major \ntheme of the pilot project because the baseline survey \nthat  was  conducted  in  Pakistan  revealed  that  basic \nhealth units\u2014the only units available to women and \ndisadvantaged groups\u2014would benefit from improve-\nments, the success of which would rely on the com-\nmitment of responsible local officials. For example, by \ninforming community members about their rights to \nsocial services and serving as mechanisms to advocate \nfor women and disadvantaged groups at the union \ncouncil level, the health monitoring committees could \nserve as a bridge between community needs and local \ngovernment obligations. \n\n13  ADB. 2003a. Report and Recommendation of the President \n\nto the Board of Directors on Proposed Program and Technical \nAssistance Loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the \nSindh Devolved Social Services Program. \n\nLocal Partnerships\n\nThe  project  team  selected  the  Aurat  Foundation  as \nthe NGO legal service partner to implement the legal \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nempowerment pilot project. For the last 21 years, the \nAurat Foundation has emerged as a leading institu-\ntion for enhancing women\u2019s economic and political \nstatus and promoting social change in Pakistan. Over \nthe years, the Aurat Foundation has developed con-\nstructive and collaborative relationships with various \ngovernment  departments  as  well  as  women  within \nlocal communities.\n\nThe Aurat Foundation is based in all of Pakistan\u2019s \n110 districts, making it one of the country\u2019s largest \ndistrict-level networks of voluntary citizens\u2019 groups and \norganizations. This network enables the Aurat Founda-\ntion to advocate effectively for its causes nationwide \nand to help women solve their immediate problems \nat the district level. \n\nThe  Aurat  Foundation  was  the  ideal  NGO  for \nimplementing  the  legal  empowerment  pilot  project \nactivities because of its extensive experience and na-\ntionwide  reach,  and  excellent  working  relationships \nwith TAF and ADB. It has a network of information \nfocal points for women in rural and urban communities \nacross Pakistan. Prior to the legal empowerment pilot, \nthe  Aurat  Foundation  in  Karachi  already  had  good \nrelationships with local government and civil society in \nthe legal empowerment project district (Mirpurkhas). \nIts staff members were also well-trained in community \noutreach and mobilization. \n\nLegal Empowerment Activities\n\nTogether with TAF and ADB, the Aurat Foundation im-\nplemented a range of legal empowerment activities.\n\nPublic Meetings and Seminars\nAccording to the UNDP human development index,14 \nRural Sindh has the lowest development indicators in \nPakistan.15 A large portion of the community is illiter-\nate; lacks confidence; and has a poor understanding \nof the role of local government, the health monitoring \ncommittees, and the concept of legal empowerment. \n\n14  The UNDP publishes a human development index, which \n\nprovides a composite measure of three dimensions of human \ndevelopment: (i) living a long and healthy life (measured \nby life expectancy); (ii) being educated (measured by adult \nliteracy and enrollment at the primary, secondary, and tertiary \nlevels); and (iii) having a decent standard of living (measured \nby purchasing power parity income).\n\nEducation, health, and other key indicators for women \nand religious minorities are particularly weak. \n\nTo  properly  inform  stakeholders  about  the  pilot \nproject\u2019s aims and maximize citizen outreach, 10 semi-\nnars were held in different neighborhoods of the two \npilot union councils. Each seminar had 100\u2013120 partici-\npants. The seminars distributed vital information about \nlegal  empowerment,  health  monitoring  committees, \nand the ADB loan. \n\nConsultations\nTwo consultations were held (one in each of the pilot \nunion  councils)  to  get  to  know  different  stakehold-\ners,  develop  a  consensus  on  health  sector  social  \nreforms issues, and build a platform on which citizens \nand government officials could work together for an \nimproved local government system, particularly in the \nhealth sector. The consultation process helped bridge \nthe  gap  between  officials  and  citizens  by  educating \ncitizens and other civil society actors about local health-\nrelated  projects  in  the  context  of  the  ADB  loan.  The \nprocess created a platform for all stakeholders to help \nmake the local health department more transparent, \naccountable, and effective. \n\nOrientation Sessions\nSecuring  the  cooperation  of  the  two  important  local \ngovernment functionaries was crucial for achieving the \nproject\u2019s objectives. Thus, orientation sessions were held \nto familiarize the district nazim (chairperson of the local \ngovernment) and the executive district officer for health \nabout the pilot project, DSSP, and the ADB loan. The na-\nzim and executive district officer received information and \ninformation materials that increased their understanding \nof the pilot project and enhanced their capacity to assist \ntargeted beneficiaries\u2014as reported by the nazim, execu-\ntive district officer, and community members.16 \n\nAwareness-Raising Sessions\nFour awareness-raising sessions were held in each of \nthe project union councils. The sessions\u2019 participants \nrepresented a broad cross section of society, including \nunion councils, citizens, media persons, community-\nbased organization representatives, and government \nfunctionaries,  particularly  employees  of  the  health \n\n15  UNDP. 2006. Human Development Report 2006. \n\nfeedback directly to the pilot project team members.\n\n16  The nazim and executive district officer for health provided this \n\n\fdepartment. These sessions aimed to promote greater \nawareness of health service delivery mechanisms, pro-\ncedures, and eligibility for services within local com-\nmunities. They also helped build a network of citizens \nto  work  with  and  monitor  the  activities  of  various \nhealth departments, including basic health units, rural \nhealth centers, the National Health Workers\u2019 Program, \nhospitals, and dispensaries. \n\nExposure Visits\nLearning from the experiences of other organizations \nand sharing best practices can have a notably positive \neffect on project results and the prospect of creating \nsustainable change. For this reason, health monitoring  \ncommittee  members  in  Mirpurkhas  District  visited \na  neighboring  district  in  which  a  health  monitoring \ncommittee had achieved some impressive results. The \n1-day exposure visit included meetings between the \nhealth monitoring committee, executive district officer \nfor health, and other district officials. It is anticipated \nthat as a result of this visit, the health monitoring com-\nmittees\u2019 will maintain contact so that they can share \nsuccessful approaches. \n\nFlyer Publication\nThe  Aurat  Foundation  published  20,000  flyers  con-\ntaining  information  about  the  health  monitoring \ncommittees, their roles and responsibilities, and how \ncitizens can access them. Flyers were disseminated via \nseminars,  newspaper  hawkers,  health  workers,  and \nstaff working on campaigns to raise awareness about \nhealth issues, such as the polio vaccination. The flyer \nwas published both in Sindhi and Urdu.\n\nKey Achievements\n\nBeneficiaries  of  the  pilot  legal  empowerment  project \nincluded  health  monitoring  committee  members, \nelected  representatives,  health  department  of-\nficials,  NGOs,  media  persons,  and  citizens  (includ-\ning  religious  minorities  and  women).  Project  ac-\ntivities  focused  on  end-users  of  health  services  and \nthose  responsible  for  service  delivery.  The  project\u2019s  \nactivities significantly increased interaction among vari-\nous stakeholders, including doctors, elected representa-\ntives, health monitoring committees, and citizens. The \npilot project formed a network of nazims, councilors, \nfemale health workers, doctors, media persons, and so-\n\nPilot Projects\n\n\u00183\n\ncial activists. This network has remained active on local \nhealth issues even after formal programming ended. \n\nThe media, government officials, and communities \nreported that, before the project, there had been no \nprecedent for disseminating critical information directly \nto communities about local government, the right to \nbasic health, or an ADB (or any development) project. \nIt is expected that participants will continue to play a \nproactive role in promoting better service delivery. \n\nAnecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  the  pilot \nproject  has  proven  to  be  a  valuable  addition  to \nthe  DSSP.  Staff  at  the  basic  health  units  and  mem-\nbers  of  the  community  report  enhanced  service \ndelivery  because  of  increased  health  monitoring \ncommittees  activity.  Given  that  this  was  a  pilot \nproject  of  short  duration,  the  achievements  were  \nsignificant. The delivery systems have been initiated, \nand  the  foundation  has  been  established  for  a  suc-\ncessful long-term intervention. \n\nHighlights of key project achievements include \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nan informed group of 60 influential community \nleaders  was  formed,  mobilized,  and  trained, \nincluding elected representatives, government \nofficials, NGOs representatives, media persons, \nand citizens; \n\nhealth facilities in the two union councils were \nimproved,  as  demonstrated  by  the  increased \nnumber of patients treated in the basic health \nunits;  regular  presence  and  punctuality  of \ndoctors and other paramedics in the hospitals \nincreased  significantly;  and  the  availability  of \nmedical supplies also improved;\n\nhundreds,  perhaps  thousands,  of  community \nmembers learned about the health monitoring \ncommittees roles and responsibilities, and com-\nmunity members now have a better understand-\ning of local government\u2019s role in delivering social \nservices; \n\n(iv) \n\n20,000 flyers on the role of health monitoring \ncommittees were printed and disseminated; \n\n(v) \n\nlocal media became an active advocate for im-\nproving service delivery, as a local cable television \nchannel broadcast a short film that advertised \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nthe health monitoring committees\u2019 roles and re-\nsponsibilities (The Asia Foundation and the Aurat \nFoundation did not cover any of the film\u2019s costs \nand a local media person appeared in the film \nfor free) and project activities were covered by \na local newspaper, Jurat, and a national private \nnews television channel, ARY One World; and\n\n(vi)  most  importantly,  marginalized  populations, \nwomen,  religious  minorities,  and  the  poor \nlearned about their legal right to basic health \ncare and how to make that right a reality. Elected \nrepresentatives  learned  about  critical  issues, \nsuch  as  the  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  health \npolicy,  gender  discrimination,  and  problems \nfaced by religious minorities. \n\nShortcomings and Challenges \n\nThe  pilot  project  focused  on  building  the  capacity \nof  health  monitoring  committee  members,  media \npersons, NGOs, and elected representatives to deliver \nbetter services. In contrast, in the three-phased sur-\nvey, the targeted interviewees were ordinary citizens \nand community members. As the interventions that \ntargeted the community at large were quite modest, \nthe survey data do not necessarily reflect the impact \nof pilot activities. \n\nThe pilot project\u2019s strategy involved a multipronged \nintervention for improved service delivery, including (i) \nbuilding the capacity of the health monitoring committees;  \n(ii)  disseminating  information  to  community  mem-\nbers, elected representatives, media and government \nofficials; and (iii) undertaking advocacy and lobbying \nlocal government officials and the health department. \nThe pilot was an ambitious initiative for an 11-month \nproject, and achieving sustainability is an even more \ndifficult  prospect.  While  initial  signs  are  positive,  it \nremains to be seen if the catalysts continue to work \nin advocating and monitoring the health department \nover the long term. \n\nAt the outset of the pilot project, the union coun-\ncils\u2019 chairpersons and the executive district officer for \nhealth  were  reluctant  to  cooperate  with  the  Aurat \nFoundation. They seemed to be uncertain about the \nAurat Foundation\u2019s motivations and were concerned \nthat its program staff might be openly critical of their \nrole or work. Fortunately, these issues of concern were \nresolved  through  consistent  engagement  and  com-\nmunity mobilization. \n\nAnother  project  obstacle  was  the  lack  of  trust \nbetween  stakeholders.  The  community  placed  little \nconfidence in elected representatives and government \ndepartments,  while  the  elected  representatives  did \nnot trust government departments. Likewise, govern-\nment officials were generally noncooperative with the \nelected representatives. Bringing all of the stakehold-\ners into discussions was a major challenge. Although \nthe situation improved over the course of the project, \nrelations could still be improved. \n\nGiven the pilot project\u2019s results, any future legal \nempowerment programming in the project site should \ninclude the district and tehsil (subdistrict) administra-\ntions. There is also a need for further training sessions \ntargeting health monitoring committees at all three \ntiers of the local government system: union council, \ntehsil, and district. An important finding of the pilot \nproject was that local government officials lacked legal \nempowerment. Legal empowerment initiatives often \nassume that the state is more legally empowered than \nlocal citizens. But this assumption may be incorrect. \nThe  pilot  project  was  focused  almost  exclusively  on \nempowering  individual  citizens  and,  in  this  context, \nthe project team learned a great deal about how this \nparticular level of empowerment actually works on the \nground. The project team concluded that the future \nlegal empowerment projects of this kind should aim \nto  ensure  that  incoming  elected  and  administrative \nofficials  at  all  relevant  levels  are  thoroughly  briefed \non DSSP, including the role of monitoring committees \nand committee procedures, so that they can more ef-\nfectively discharge their monitoring functions.\n\n\fTable 1:  Pilot Legal Empowerment Projects\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndonesia\n\nPakistan\n\nAsian Development \nBank Host Project\n\nSecond Small-Scale Water  \nResources Development Sector \nProject (SSSWRDSP)\n\nNeighborhood Upgrading \nand Shelter Project (NUSSP)\n\nSindh Devolved Social Services  \nProgram (DSSP)\n\nObjectives of the \nLegal Empowerment \nIntervention\n\nIncrease the capacity of \nwomen and disadvantaged \ngroups to participate in the \nestablishment of sustainable, \nstakeholder-driven water  \nresource management systems\n\nIncrease the capacity of low-\nincome communities to  \nunderstand the procedures \nand requirements for access-\ning benefits available through \nthe project\n\nLocal Partner\n\nAin O Shalish Kendra (ASK)\n\nIndonesian Women\u2019s Associa-\ntion for Justice (APIK)\n\nLegal Empowerment \nActivities\n\n\u2022\n\nTraining\n\n\u2022\n\nBriefings and trainings\n\n\u2022\n\nPublic meetings and seminars\n\nTraining for community \ncommittee members\n\n\u2022\n\nConsultations\n\n\u2022\n\nLegal awareness forum\n\n\u2022\n\nIssue-based drama  \npresentations\n\n\u2022\n\nFollow-up visits\n\n\u2022\n\nCoordination meetings\n\n\u2022\n\nMedia campaigns\n\nPilot Projects\n\n\u0018\u0018\n\nIncrease the capacity of health \nmonitoring committees to improve \ntheir effectiveness in interacting \nwith local government officials, \nbasic health unit staff, and women \nand disadvantaged groups to en-\nsure that the latter can harness the \nfull benefits envisioned for them in \nthe project design\n\nAurat Publication and Information \nService Foundation (Aurat  \nFoundation)\n\n\u2022\n\nOrientation sessions\n\n\u2022\n\nAwareness-raising sessions\n\n\u2022\n\nExposure visits\n\n\u2022\n\nFlyer publication\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nIncreased interaction among \nvarious stakeholders, including \ndoctors, elected representa-\ntives, health management \ncommittees, and citizens\n\nFormation of a network of \nnazims, councilors, female \nhealth workers, doctors, media \npersons, and social activists\n\nEnhanced service delivery in \nbasic health units\n\nIncreased understanding of \nhow to access basic health care \namong women, minorities, and \nthe poor\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nCommunity meetings for \nmembers of community \ncommittees\n\nVisit to City of Makassar \nLand Agency Office\n\nSocial mapping exercise\n\nIncreased knowledge and \nunderstanding of the \nNUSSP mechanism, the \nrole and duties of BKM, \nrelations between BKM \nand NUSSP/LCO, and \nhow to resolve problems \nthat arise in the NUSSP \nprogram.\n\nImproved understanding \nof gender issues and the \nimpact of gender-based \nviolence in NUSSP com-\nmunities.\n\nThe chief government of-\nficial of Tallo District com-\nmitted to use the output \nof the mapping exercise \nto justify a free/ low-cost \ncertification program in \nthe District and Makassar \nCity Musrenbang. \n\nAchievements\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nIncrease in participation \nin meetings and forums \nof the water management \ncooperative associations \n(WMCAs), particularly by \nwomen\n\nBroader view of the role \nof the WMCAs among the \ngeneral public\n\nCreation of human rights \nviolation prevention  \ncommittees\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndonesia\n\nPakistan\n\nChallenges\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nEnhanced understand-\ning of the importance of \ninvolving women in pro-\ngram implementation and \nBKM decision making.\n\nGiven time and resource \nconstraints, the pilot \nplaced primary emphasis \non work with BKM of-\nficers, with limited scope \nfor broader community \noutreach.

It is hoped \nthat the lessons learned and experience gained under \nthe project will encourage the incorporation of legal \nempowerment components within ADB loans and the \nactivities of other development partner organizations. \nIn  particular,  the  design  and  testing  of  specialized \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  tools  may  prove \nuseful in future ADB loans.\n\nAdvancement of Knowledge and \nPractical Experience\n\nThe project has contributed to ADB, other bilateral and \nmultilateral  development  agencies,  and  other  devel-\nopment  professionals  in  Bangladesh,  Indonesia,  and \nPakistan  by  advancing  their  knowledge  and  practical \nexperience  in  this  field.  The  project  is  ADB\u2019s  second \nformal  focus  on  legal  empowerment  and  builds  on \nits  2001  legal  empowerment  study.  It  is  significant \nthat since 2001, legal empowerment as a concept has \nachieved  a  higher  profile  in  the  development  sector, \naccompanied by the substantial expansion of practical  \nexperience  reflected  in  the  three  country  situation \nanalysis (CSA) reports. \n\nKeen Domestic, Regional, and \nInternational Interest in the Project\n\nThe project team was especially struck by the interest \ntaken in the project by legal scholars, practitioners, and \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\ndonor agencies in the three countries. The project team \nreceived numerous inquiries from around the world by \nindividuals and agencies seeking more information on \nthe project. Additionally, the December 2007 regional \nconference was attended by representatives from nu-\nmerous countries other than the three focal countries, \nshowing broader regional and international interest and \nparticipation in the legal empowerment concept. The \nproject experience affirms the increasing significance of \nlegal empowerment and the more sophisticated con-\nceptual framework and depth of practical experience \non which it rests in 2008 compared to 2001. \n\nMore Sophisticated Analysis and \nUnderstanding of Legal Empowerment\n\nOne of the most encouraging aspects of the growing \ninterest  in  legal  empowerment  is  the  movement  of \nanalysis along the same vertical band or ascending scale \ndescribed  in  the  conceptual  framework  included  as  \nAppendix 1. Increasing emphasis is placed and attention \ndevoted to understanding the higher order elements of \nlegal empowerment that move beyond basic awareness \nraising and individual legal problems to focus on com-\nmunity capacity and confidence building. \n\nThere  was  variation  in  the  three  focal  countries \nregarding issues encountered and insights drawn in \nconducting research, implementing pilot projects, and \napplying a rigorous M&E methodology. However, some \ncommon  threads  of  experience  and  lessons  learned \nemerged.\n\nLessons Learned from the Pilot \nLegal Empowerment Projects  \nand Specialized Monitoring  \nand Evaluation Methodology\n\nMilestone Investment in Pilot Legal \nEmpowerment Projects and a Specially \nDesigned Monitoring and Evaluation \nMethodology\n\nThere  are  two  distinguishing  features  of  the  project:  \n(i) the allocation of resources and technical support for \npilot projects that integrated legal empowerment com-\nponents in three ADB loans; and (ii) the development of \n\na specialized M&E methodology that compared impact \nin pilot project intervention areas and nonintervention \ncontrol  areas.  These  features  were  recognized  and \nappreciated in each country. The post-CSA consultative \nworkshops were well-attended, and many of those who \njoined the consultative dialogue from government, civil \nsociety, and academia stayed in touch with the country \ntechnical assistance teams over the course of the project. \nWhile the three pilot projects shine relatively modest \nlight in a broader universe of development activities, \nthey  marked  the  first  time  that  legal  empowerment \nactivities (guided by unified design and M&E protocols) \nwere implemented concurrently in three countries in the \ncontext of ADB loan facilities. The project team believes \nthat the most significant contributions to this project are \nthe M&E protocols, and the lessons that can be drawn \nfrom the challenges faced in applying the methodol-\nogy in three countries. These are reported in detail in \nAppendix 3, as well as in the Good Practices Guide for \nIncorporating Legal Empowerment into Operations.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation Methodologies \nHave Not Kept Pace with Program \nDevelopments in Legal Empowerment\n\nThe CSA exercise gathered valuable information on legal \nempowerment  developments  in  the  three  countries. \nThe  CSAs  noted  that  aspects  of  the  country  context \nand program environment had changed relatively little \nin the 5 years since the 2001 ADB legal empowerment \nstudy.  In  particular,  it  was  found  that  M&E  strate-\ngies had evolved relatively little. Most methodologies \ncontinued  to  count  basic  outputs  rather  than  seek-\ning to understand the impact of legal empowerment \nactivities  on  governance  reform  and  poverty  reduc-\ntion\u2014that  is,  how  legal  empowerment  affects  qual-\nity  of  life  beyond  the  individuals  served.  Appendix  3  \ncontains  information  on  further  lessons  learned  and \nrecommendations.\n\nRecommendations\n\nNeed for Ongoing Investment in \nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe M&E methodology was specifically designed to \nmeasure the impact of legal empowerment projects \n\n\fThis  report\u2019s  overarching  recommendation  for  legal \nempowerment  work  is  that  ADB  and  other  interna-\ntional agencies place less emphasis on general situa-\ntion analysis and greater emphasis on pilot program \nactivities  and  specialized  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystems.  In  particular,  it  encourages  concentrated \ninvestment in pilot program activities and developing \nspecialized monitoring and evaluation methodologies \nthat are specifically designed to assess the higher-order \nimpact of legal empowerment programs. This is espe-\ncially important in the context of legal empowerment \ninterventions that are integrated in the sector program \nwork  of  ADB  and  other  international  agencies.  This \nis  because  in  sector-program  work,  managers  and \nresource  managers  frequently  insist  on  convincing \nempirical  evidence  of  the  value  of  legal  empower-\nment  in  advancing  sector  development  goals  that \nare constrained by rights and access to justice issues \nthat  prevent  program  beneficiaries  from  accessing \nresources, services, and opportunities.\n\nin  advancing  the  goals  of  the  host  ADB  loans.  The \nproject  team  believes  this  was  the  first  methodol-\nogy of its kind developed to measure the impact of \nlegal empowerment activities that are integrated in \nsector  development  programs.  As  such,  while  the \nmethodology is a significant first step, further effort \nis needed to develop and test M&E methodologies in \nthe future, learning from project experience described \nin Appendix 3. This recommendation is naturally pre-\nmised on the broader recommendation that ADB and \nother development partners continue to support the \nintegration of legal empowerment activities in their \nsector program work. \n\nOne of the key features of the project\u2019s M&E strat-\negy was to move away from the conventional practice \nof counting basic outputs. Instead, the project team \nfocused  on  understanding  the  higher-order  impact \nof legal empowerment in advancing the governance \nreform and poverty reduction goals of ADB loans. It is \nalso important that practitioners treat this kind of work \nas a learning experience and report candidly on the \npositive results achieved and challenges faced in imple-\nmenting legal empowerment activities. A key question \nposed regarding applying the specialized M&E meth-\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\n\u00189\n\nodology  under  the  three  pilot  legal  empowerment \nprojects was: can changes observed be attributed to \nlegal empowerment interventions? Care must be taken \nto modestly draw conclusions from the work under-\ntaken given the narrow confines of the pilot projects of  \n1 year or less in duration. However, it seems clear that \ncertain positive changes observed in the experience of \nwomen and disadvantaged groups in the pilot project \nintervention areas are linked to the legal empowerment \ninterventions. The connection was particularly signifi-\ncant in the case of changes in the strategies followed \nby  women  and  disadvantaged  groups  in  advancing \ntheir rights and interests.\n\nIt is essential that those involved in legal empow-\nerment  activities  share  information  and  learning, \nparticularly those pioneering the integration of legal \nempowerment in sector development programs. Com-\nmitting to exchanging information in good faith will \nensure that others can benefit from individual efforts. \nIt will also help legal empowerment practitioners, gov-\nernment counterparts, legal and development scholars, \nand international agencies collectively develop a com-\nmon base of knowledge that can be shared, discussed, \nand enhanced as legal empowerment activities expand \nin Asia and internationally.\n\nImportance of Cooperative Working \nRelations among All Stakeholders\n\nThe pilot-project experience yields important lessons \nfor future work of this kind. It is essential to develop \nstrong and cooperative working relationships between \nthe designers and implementers of legal empowerment \nactivities and their ADB and government counterparts. \nThe legal service NGO partners that implemented the  \npilot  projects  generally  received  strong  and  timely \nsupport from ADB counterparts, particularly in taking \naccount of how busy ADB sector-program managers \nare and their lack of experience in the specialized field \nof  law  and  development.  It  is  also  fundamental  to \ndevelop a common terminology that describes legal \nempowerment  concepts  and  documents  experience \nin  practical  terms  that  are  readily  understood  by  all \ninvolved. To encourage the continued incorporation \nof legal empowerment in sector development work, \nteams must share their experiences in ways that under-\nline the value of legal empowerment in contributing \nto such projects. \n\n\f30\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nThe quality of working relationships with govern-\nment counterparts varied from country to country and \ncontext to context. The project team noted that certain \nchallenges were frequently encountered when working \nwith government counterparts on legal empowerment \nprojects.17 In particular, the very term \u201clegal empower-\nment\u201d tends to cause concerns among government \ncounterparts,  who  worry  that  legal  empowerment \ninterventions may affect the traditional power advan-\ntages that government officials and elites have over \nmarginalized populations. \n\nGovernment  counterparts  may  be  wary  of  the  \nnotion of empowerment, concerned that it will require \nthat they surrender traditional power advantages, be \nsubject  to  legal  pressures  from  legal  empowerment \npractitioners,  face  criticism,  or  otherwise  be  com-\npelled  to  relinquish  benefits  or  privileges  that  they \nhave enjoyed as a result of their traditional role and \nrelationship with disadvantaged populations. In some \ninstances,  their  concerns  are  actually  well-founded. \nThe challenge lies in convincing hesitant government \nofficials that, while their traditional power advantages \nmay indeed need to change or be reevaluated in cer-\ntain ways, there are other incentives from which their \nreputations stand to benefit if they are supportive of \nlegal empowerment initiatives. \n\nValue of Information Sharing\n\nLegal  empowerment  work  relies  upon  developing \ncomplex  and  mutually  reinforcing  working  relation-\nships between varying parties. If the work is to evolve, \nit  is  essential  that  legal  empowerment  practitioners \nwork in a transparent manner, meeting regularly with \ngovernment  counterparts  to  share  information,  and \nencourage  public  officials  and  agencies  to  develop  a \nsense  of  ownership  in  the  work.  A  positive  working \nrelationship of this kind is critical to the success of legal \nempowerment initiatives, with program implementation \nshaped by a combination of goals and considerations \n\n17  The Asia Foundation. 2002. Indonesia Irrigation Sector Legal \nEmpowerment Study\u2014Program Strategy and Implementation \nPlan for the Integration of a Legal Empowerment Component \nIn the Participatory Irrigation Sector Project. San Francisco. The \nteam made these observations based on its experience work-\ning on the pilot projects under the project and also from the \nFoundation\u2019s earlier experience with the Indonesia Irrigation \nSector Legal Empowerment Study (2001\u20132003). \n\nof importance to all stakeholders. A positive attitude on \nthe part of government counterparts will also encourage \nwomen and other disadvantaged groups that are inten-\nded to benefit from a legal empowerment activity to \nparticipate in project activities. For legal empowerment \nto be effective, effective and functioning government \ninstitutions are required. Even the most confident and \nknowledgeable person is unlikely to enforce their rights \nif they have no confidence in the institutions charged \nwith protecting those rights.\n\nSelection of Pilot Project Sites\n\nThe pilot-project experience further affirms that great \ncare and consideration must be taken in selecting the \nproject  location.  In  Bangladesh,  the  pilot-project  site \nwas  selected  because  of  a  combination  of  factors, \nincluding the choice of a geographic area in which the \nlegal  service  NGO  partner  had  an  operating  base.  In \nretrospect, an ideal pilot-project location would have \nbeen one in which the ADB host project had been work-\ning for a longer period and reached certain milestones \nin the sequence of implementation.\n\nLegal Empowerment is a Long-Term \nProcess That Warrants Extended \nInvestment\n\nIt is important to appreciate that legal empowerment is a \nlong-term process and that the best results are achieved \nover time. It was understood by ADB counterparts and \nthe team from the outset of the project that the time \nand resources available for the pilot projects were quite \nmodest and that expectations for measurable impact \nin the short term should be kept similarly modest. ADB \ncounterparts were extremely generous in extending ad-\nditional time for the pilot projects when the selection \nand preparatory start up process required more time \nthan originally anticipated. Moreover, as described in  \nAppendix 3, some striking results were, in fact, achieved \nin  a  relatively  short  period  of  time.  But  these  results \nmostly  hint  at,  rather  than  conclusively  affirm,  the \nimpact of legal empowerment in the context of sector \ndevelopment programs. Future resource allocations by \nADB and other international agencies should provide \nample time to design, implement, monitor, and assess \nthe impact of pilot legal empowerment projects, and \nideally afford opportunities to implement pilot activi-\n\n\fties  in  a  variety  of  contexts  so  that  comparisons  can \nbe drawn among activities implemented in a variety of \ncircumstances.\n\nLegal Empowerment Advances Sector \nDevelopment Goals\n\nTogether with the 2001 ADB legal empowerment study, \nthe project affirms the value of legal empowerment in \nadvancing governance reform and poverty reduction, \nand in supporting the achievement of sector program \ngoals. This latter area holds the greatest potential as \nthe new frontier of legal empowerment, and ADB and \nother international agencies are encouraged to invest \nin  projects  that  will  advance  the  integration  of  legal \nempowerment in sector development programs.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe project provided ADB with a unique opportunity to \nselect NGO legal service partners and core stakeholders \nto  pilot  test  legal  empowerment  projects  and  assess \ntheir  impact  using  a  specially  designed  M&E  meth-\nodology.  While  the  pilot  projects  are  a  modest  step \nimplemented within a narrow time period, their results \nsupport the further integration of legal empowerment \nin the program operations of ADB and other develop-\nment partner agencies. The Good Practices Guide for \nIncorporating  Legal  Empowerment  Components  into \nADB Operations provides further background and prac-\ntical guidance for future legal empowerment work. It is \nhoped that this handbook will serve as a resource that \nis regularly updated through inputs by ADB program \nspecialists, NGO practitioners, and other users to take \naccount of the experience and lessons learned of those \nwho use them.\n\nADB also conducted an internal portfolio review \nas part of the background to this report. The review \napplied a series of criteria in identifying potential ADB \nhost projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan, \nincluding existing projects and those in pipeline deve-\nlopment.  While  the  review  was  concerned  primarily \nwith the three focal countries under the project, the \nbasic criteria extended to ADB operations throughout \nAsia. The portfolio review also considered the key find-\nings and recommendations of working groups formed \nduring the December 2007 regional conference. The \n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\n31\n\ngroups recommended applying the project findings, \ndraft guide, and handbook in designing legal empow-\nerment activities based on the context of two pending \nADB loans in Bangladesh and the Philippines.\n\nSet  out  below  are  the  key  findings  and  recom-\n\nmendations of the portfolio review.\n\nKey Findings of the Portfolio Review\n\nWhile  some  good  practices  have  been  established  in \nthe  design  and  implementation  of  gender  and  legal \nempowerment activities in particular projects, there is \nno coherent approach to legal empowerment in ADB \ncountry portfolios. While country gender assessments \nprovide an analysis of gender and legal empowerment \nissues and strategies, they are not systematically inte-\ngrated  into  the  country  partnership  strategies.  This \nfirst finding is in no way a criticism of ADB, but simply \nidentifies an area of opportunity for future planning as \nADB places increasing emphasis on the importance of \nlegal empowerment.\n\nProgram  loans  can  and  do  play  an  important \nrole in creating an enabling environment for gender \nand  legal  empowerment  interventions.  Although \nlegal  empowerment  activities  may  be  specified  in \nthe gender action plan, main body of the report and \nrecommendation  to  the  President,  or  in  the  project \ndesign for certain ADB activities, these activities tend \nnot  to  be  consistently  incorporated  into  the  design \nand monitoring framework or the project performance \nmanagement  system.  The  implication  is  that  legal  \nempowerment  opportunities  that  could  have  a  sig-\nnificant impact on loan performance and outreach to \nwomen and disadvantaged groups may go unfulfilled \nor fall short of potential. \n\nThe quality of knowledge of legal empowerment \n\u2014including  concepts,  framework,  and  the  type  of \nactivities that constitute legal empowerment\u2014tends \nto vary among ADB project specialists and staff. This \nis natural given that ADB officers are busy with other \nproject responsibilities and in most cases have no for-\nmal legal background or exposure to legal empower-\nment work. But, there is an urgent need for project \nofficers and team leaders to understand and be aware \nof the relevance of legal empowerment activities to \ntheir projects so that they can design and implement \ngender and legal empowerment activities effectively. \nWhere the project officer and/or team leader agree that \n\n\f3\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nlegal empowerment is an important consideration for \neffective project implementation, the next challenge is \nfinding the expertise and resources to implement it.\n\nThe  following  sectors  and  subsectors  provide  a \nsignificant number of opportunities and entry points to \nincorporate gender and legal empowerment activities: \nhealth,  education,  water  and  sanitation,  agriculture \nand  natural  resource  development,  and  small-scale \nurban  infrastructure  development.  These  particular \nsectors and subsectors tend to be especially important \nto women and other marginalized groups, and tend \nto feature administrative and other decision-making \nmechanisms  in  which  women  and  disadvantaged \ngroups  have  traditionally  been  unable  to  assume  a \nsignificant role. At the same time, all sectors potentially \nhold opportunities for the incorporation of gender and \nlegal empowerment activities.\n\nProjects with mainstream gender considerations \nprovide  more  effective  strategies  for  women\u2019s  and \ncommunity empowerment and are, therefore, more \nconducive to incorporating legal empowerment ele-\nments. Conversely, incorporating legal empowerment \nactivities as an element of broader gender strategies \nenhances women\u2019s empowerment.\n\nWhere  gender  and  legal  empowerment  com-\nponents and activities are incorporated into existing \nprojects, there is a tendency to focus on those activi-\nties that raise men\u2019s and women\u2019s awareness about \ntheir rights, and access to services and other benefits. \nThis is an important first step in a long-term process. \nHowever, legal empowerment is concerned with raising \nawareness and increasing the capacity and confidence \nof  the  entire  community\u2014women  and  men\u2014to  \nbetter  advance  their  rights  and  entitlements  to  \nresources, services, and opportunities. \n\nThe  ways  in  which  these  activities  impact  on \nwomen  and  men  in  the  community  can  only  be  \nestablished over time. For example, training govern-\nment agencies on gender and development policy does \nnot  automatically  lead  to  women\u2019s  legal  empower-\nment;  neither  does  fostering  women\u2019s  representa-\ntion  in  water  user  associations,  school  committees, \nand  other  local  structures.  But,  if  these  activities \nare  sustained  over  time,  and  combined  with  other \nactivities that challenge traditional views on the role \nand  capacity  of  women  and  disadvantaged  groups \nto  participate  in  community  development,  they  are \nmore likely to achieve a positive impact on increasing \n\nwomen\u2019s empowerment. While ADB projects are evalu-\nated after completion, impact assessment of emerging \nlegal empowerment activities is not systematically and \ncomprehensively undertaken.\n\nProjects that have a strong focus on good gover-\nnance provide greater opportunities for incorporating \nlegal  empowerment  activities.  Strengthening  gover-\nnance to ensure that it is gender-sensitive, transparent, \nand participatory is a key component of an effective \nlegal empowerment strategy. Integrating good gov-\nernance as a strong crosscutting theme into all sector \ninvestments contributes to enhancing the legal empow-\nerment of women and men in the community.\n\nBased  on  the  portfolio  review  and  the  project\u2019s \npilot-project  experiences,  ADB  considers  that  lo-\ncal  government  structures  are  not  necessarily  more \nconducive  to  gender  and  legal  empowerment  op-\nportunities. They too can be dominated by powerful \nparties with vested interests that block and undermine \ncommunity  empowerment.  However,  making  these \nlocal  structures  more  transparent  and  accountable \nis  a  necessary  precondition  for  community  empow-\nerment.  National  policy  reform  plays  a  significant \nrole  in  fostering  an  enabling  environment  that  can \nprovide  community  members  with  the  leverage  \nrequired  to  engage  and  reform  local  governance \nstructures. Projects with incorporated gender-inclusive,  \ncommunity-based,  participatory  approaches  provide \ngreater scope for legal empowerment activities.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe  portfolio  review  affirmed  that  the  present  ADB \nportfolio  and  pipeline  project  plans  hold  significant \npotential for integrating legal empowerment activities. \nWhile some ADB projects have a more specific focus on \nwomen and disadvantaged groups, virtually every ADB \nproject  includes  women  and  disadvantaged  groups \namong broader beneficiary populations. ADB has made \nsignificant progress toward subjecting every new project \nto rigorous gender analysis. This analysis may be drawn \non to inform the design of integrated or associated legal \nempowerment projects.\n\nThe need and opportunities for legal empower-\nment can be affirmed by the portfolio review. Then, the \nlegal empowerment\u2019s project design and implementa-\ntion can draw on (i) the findings and recommenda-\ntions of the project, including the core findings and \n\n\frecommendations reported in Chapter 5 of the main \nreport;  (ii)  pilot  legal  empowerment  project  experi-\nence documented in Chapter 4 and Appendix 3; and  \n(iii) practical suggestions provided in Good Practices \nGuide  for  Incorporating  Legal  Empowerment  into \nOperations.\n\nMany  factors  can  affect  the  success  of  a  legal \nempowerment project. But, the prospect of success \nis enhanced by thoughtful planning, sound empirical \nresearch, strong partnerships, good communication, \nand investment in rigorous monitoring and evaluation \nmethodologies. \n\nThoughtful Planning\nLegal  empowerment  projects  need  careful  planning \nand  resource  allocation  regardless  of  whether  they \nare integrated into an existing or planned ADB proj-\nect.  Although  the  pilot-project  experience  affirms \nthat a legal empowerment activity can be added to \nan ongoing project, it is better to incorporate a legal \nempowerment strategy as part of the original program \ndesign. Ideally, the strategic planning process should \ntake  careful  account  of  (i)  the  host  project\u2019s  goals;  \n(ii) the legal, administrative, and other challenges that \nwomen and other disadvantaged groups are likely to \nface in accessing project benefits; (iii) any resistance \nthat is likely to be encountered from counterparts in \ngovernment  or  other  sectors;  (iv)  strategies  to  ad-\ndress resistance to the project; and (v) the steps to be \nfollowed  in  implementing  the  legal  empowerment \ncomponent. The last factor needs to address whether \nlegal  empowerment  activities  will  be  introduced  on \nan incremental basis and extended to different project \nareas over a period of months or years.\n\nSound Empirical Research\nThe project experience affirms the importance of bas-\ning  legal  empowerment  project  design  and  strategic \nconsiderations  on  sound  empirical  research.  Qualita-\ntive and quantitative research are needed to develop a \nproper understanding of (i) the issues to be addressed; \n(ii)  the  experience  and  views  of  different  stakeholder \ngroups  (including  project  beneficiaries,  government \nagencies and officials, and local elites and other per-\nsons  of  influence);  and  (iii)  a  baseline  of  conditions, \nstakeholder status, and experiences as they exist at the \nstart of the project from which to assess changes and \nresults over time.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\n33\n\nStrong Partnerships\nSuccessful legal empowerment strategies depend on \nthe joint efforts of different stakeholder groups. Civil \nsociety organizations have tended to play a pioneer-\ning  role  in  legal  empowerment  activities.  But,  the \nimportance of government officials and agencies to \nthe success and sustainability of legal empowerment \nwork is  increasingly  recognized. An  integrated  legal \nempowerment  project  should  aim  to  engage  the \nplanning,  implementation,  and  impact  assessment \ninputs of multiple stakeholders. It also needs strong \ngovernment involvement and practical representation \nin planning and decision making.\n\nGood Communication\nGood  communication  lies  at  the  heart  of  strong \npartnerships  in  legal  empowerment  project  design \nand  implementation.  Stakeholders  typically  come \nto  a  cooperative  working  relationship  with  certain \nexperience,  understanding,  and  expectations,  some \nof  which  reflect  actual  circumstances  while  others \nreflect  simple  misunderstanding  or  lack  of  exposure. \nLegal  empowerment  depends  on  the  cooperative  \nefforts of civil society, government officials, beneficiary \nor local partner communities, and ADB program staff, \nand  good  relationships  will  strengthen  this  process. \nThis is one of the key lessons learned in the pilot legal \nempowerment projects\u2014in several cases, the progress \nand potential impact of activities was hindered by poor \ncommunications between the NGO legal service orga-\nnizations and their government counterparts. \n\nThe  need  for  developing  good  communica-\ntion processes also extends to ADB operations. ADB \nprogram personnel need to understand the benefits \nof  legal empowerment and its  potential  to  improve \nsector program outcomes. To do this, legal empow-\nerment strategies must be made more agreeable to \nADB  sector  project  managers  by  distilling  the  com-\nplex concepts into practical terms that can be readily  \nunderstood. By doing this, ADB sector project manag-\ners who have no experience with legal empowerment \nand limited time to engage outside of their specific \nprofessional areas of focus are more likely to incorpo-\nrate legal empowerment strategies in their projects.\n\nRigorous Monitoring and Evaluation\nLegal empowerment initiatives will probably be held \nto a high standard of performance and scrutiny. This \n\n\f3\u0018\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nis because the initiatives propose that they can lead \nto (i) women and other marginalized groups having \nadvanced  rights  and  other  economic  opportunities,  \n(ii)  governance  reform,  and  (iii)  poverty  reduction. \nThese are significant aspirations. \n\nPreviously, legal empowerment practitioners have \ntended to count basic outputs rather than designing \nM&E  strategies  aimed  at  understanding  the  impact \nof legal empowerment in the context of higher-order \n\ngovernance  reform  or  poverty  reduction.  The  pilot  \nlegal empowerment projects adopted a new approach. \nThe project team designed M&E strategies specifically \naimed  at  measuring  the  impact  of  project  activities \non the performance of the host ADB loan. Given the \nsuccess of this approach, it is recommended that this \nrigorous model be followed in future legal empower-\nment activities that are integrated in host ADB sector \nprogram activities.\n\n\fAppendix 1 \nOverview of Legal Empowerment\n\nThe Constraints Faced by Women \nand Other Disadvantaged Groups\n\nTo fully grasp the practical application of legal empow-\nerment initiatives, it helps to understand the kinds of \nlegal- and law-related administrative and governance \nconstraints that affect women and other disadvantaged \ngroups in developing nations. In developing nations, it \nis common for legal and related governance constraints \nto affect the general circumstances of disadvantaged \npopulations.  Such  constraints  can  affect  the  pace, \nprogress,  and  outcomes  of  sector  development  pro-\ngrams that the Asian Development Bank (ADB), other \ninternational agencies, and government counterparts \nundertake in a variety of development sectors.\n\nWomen and disadvantaged groups face a combi-\nnation of obstacles that affect their social, economic, \nand political status and circumstances. These obstacles \ninclude  (i)  basic  constraints  affecting  physical  and \neconomic security, ownership of property and other \neconomic  assets,  and  one\u2019s  voice  in  public  affairs;  \n(ii) intermediate constraints affecting access to legal \nand other public institutions and support mechanisms; \nand (iii) high-end policy constraints and systemic chal-\nlenges that continue to pose barriers to the broader \nadvancement of disadvantaged populations notwith-\nstanding  the  fact  that  individuals  are  better  served \nby practical support mechanisms. This information is \nsummarized in the table at page 49. \n\nBasic Constraints\n\nformal rights or entitlements that the law may prescribe. \nIn many conservative societies women are confined to a \nmarginal role. For example, a woman might be confined \nto the family compound at the insistence of her husband \nor male relatives, denied an equal share of property on \nthe death of a husband or father, barred from a post- \nelementary education, refused access to clinical health \ncare,  denied  employment  opportunities  outside  the \nhome, refused participation in public decision making, \nand  deprived  of  basic  security  to  move  freely  in  the \ncommunity without threat of violence or intimidation. \nIn  many  societies,  the  poor  and  other  marginalized \ngroups  are  treated  as  second-class  citizens.  Persons \nof political or social rank and economic means justify \nthis suppression on the grounds that they are better \npositioned to judge what is good for the lower ranks \nof  society  than  the  disadvantaged.  Alternatively,  in  a \nsociety  dominated  by  patriarchy,  patron\u2013client,\u0004  and \nother inequitable power relations, marginalized popu-\nlations face a barrage of pressure, threats and actual \nviolence,  land  grabbing,  intimidation  by  police  and \npolitically-sponsored  thugs,  corruption,  and  acts  of \nimpunity by various actors that command significant \npower advantages over the poor.\n\nLack of Knowledge among Citizens  \nand Public Officials\nIn  developing  countries,  citizens\u2019  inadequate  under-\nstanding of the laws and the rights and obligations that \nthose laws confer, poses a fundamental constraint to \n\nTraditional Religious, Cultural, and Social Norms\nIndividuals  and  communities  living  on  the  fringe  of \ndeveloping society tend to live according to traditional \nreligious or cultural norms and values. These norms and \nvalues define their existence and have little regard to any \n\n\u0004  This concept may be defined as a mutually obligatory arrange-\nment between an individual who has authority, social status, \nwealth, or some other personal resource (the patron) and \nanother person who benefits from his or her support or influ-\nence (the client).\n\n\f36\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\ncitizens accessing justice. Low literacy rates and other \nconsequences of weak or exclusive education systems \ndeprive  marginalized  groups  of  the  information  that \nthey need to protect their legal rights. This is the case \neven where a country\u2019s laws provide for fair and equi-\ntable protection of all citizens\u2019 rights. If citizens do not \nunderstand that they have rights that they can protect, \nor if they do not have enough money to enforce those \nrights, they will not be able to use the legal system to \ntheir advantage. This situation has particular implica-\ntions for women, given gender inequalities in literacy \nrates in many countries. \n\nIn a multilingual country, legal policy, laws, and \nlegal judgments may be published in only one of the \ncountry\u2019s official languages. In such countries, court \ncases will also only be run in the language in which the \nlaws are published. Where the legal system operates in \na language used only by a country\u2019s wealthy minority, \nthe country\u2019s poor majority will not understand that \nlegal system and will have a poor grasp of their legal \nrights and entitlements. \n\nTo  ensure  that  citizens  can  access  justice,  the \nsystem must be readily accessible and useable. Legal \ninformation  must  be  publicly  and  readily  available. \nIt must be published in plain, easily understood lan-\nguage. Steps must also be taken to ensure that illiter-\nate members of society can access information on their \nrights and how to access justice. Where a government \ntakes no steps to disseminate information on new or \namended laws, changes in administrative procedures, \nor other matters of interest, citizens have little hope \nof understanding and acting on important informa-\ntion. It is important to recognize that knowledge con-\nstraints are not limited to citizens. Public officials and \nagencies frequently have inadequate knowledge and \nresources. This is problematic where a public official \nis responsible for making formal decisions or having \nto exercise discretion when making a judgment that \naffects the rights of disadvantaged communities. The \npublic official may not have a proper understanding of \nthe steps to be followed or the legal or administrative \nprinciples  to  apply  in  making  the  decision  and  this \nwill affect the quality of his or her decision making. \nSteps  taken  to  raise  citizen  knowledge  will  only  be \nsuccessful if concurrent efforts are taken to educate \nand empower public officials.\n\nEven where individuals have a basic understanding \nof their legal rights and obligations, they still may not \n\nunderstand what the law requires of them and how \nthey can enforce those rights. For example, a woman \nmay vaguely know that she is entitled to inherit prop-\nerty. But, she may not understand what the legal and \nadministrative  processes  are  for  her  to  enforce  that \nright. Therefore, while she might have the strongest \nclaim to inherit property, someone else might actually \ninherit it. Without higher-order knowledge of this kind, \ndisadvantaged groups may, for practical purposes, be \npowerless to access the legal system, seek the advice \nof a legal professional or support agency, or even think \nof asserting their rights. \n\nLack of Economic Independence\nLack  of  economic  independence  places  broad  con-\nstraints  on  citizens\u2019  access  to  justice  and  critical  re-\nsources, and participation in administrative and other \npublic decision-making processes. \n\nAlthough  disadvantaged  populations  face  a \nvariety  of  legal  problems,  they  most  frequently  en-\ncounter family law and property disputes. The fam-\nily law disputes affect women\u2019s rights, security, and \n\nPeople  who  depend  on  husbands,  employers, \nlandlords,  local  elite  power  brokers,  or  others \nwith whom they stand in an unequal power re-\nlationship are bound to be constrained in exercis-\ning their rights or in asking public authorities to \nmake equitable decisions on matters of interest \nto them. Even where all other factors are support-\nive, poverty may ultimately determine the way in \nwhich disadvantaged populations experience jus-\ntice, governance, and resource allocation, as well \nas the leverage that they can exert in pursuing \ntheir interests. In this context, no combination of \nsound laws, competent lawyers and judges, strict \nand consistent principles of legal enforcement, or \nsupport mechanisms will suffice to safeguard the \nrights of a destitute woman, victim of domestic \nviolence, or an abandoned wife if she is too poor \nto hire a lawyer or to travel to a district town to \nseek the support of a legal services nongovern-\nment  organization.  Gender  disparities  in  eco-\nnomic decision making and wages are especially \nproblematic in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, \nand other developing countries.\n\n\flegal entitlements, while the property disputes arise \nbetween neighbors and family members. Those with \nsufficient  money,  stature,  and  connections  may  be \nin  positions  to  access  legal  support  services,  which \nmight include the formal court system; administrative \nmechanisms that facilitate licenses, permits, and other \nlegal  requirements  or  community-based  alternative \ndispute  resolution  (ADR)  mechanisms,  such  as  the \ntraditional  shalish  in  Bangladesh.  In  contrast,  those \nwithout money and social leverage must depend on \na more limited range of options. They are also more \nsusceptible  to  manipulation  or  abuse  when  access-\ning available support mechanisms. The extreme poor \nlack the time and resources to travel long distances \nto resolve legal problems through formal or informal \nmechanisms. To improve the disadvantaged groups\u2019 \naccess to law and governance structures, legal services \nmust reach out to them.\n\nIntermediate Constraints\n\nThose who overcome the basic impediments to access-\ning justice then face a second, middle-order tier of con-\nstraints that are more complex that those encountered at \nthe lowest tier. The middle-order constraints are equally \ncapable of frustrating a person\u2019s quest for justice or voice \nin administrative governance. They include (i) the maze \nof entrenched patron\u2013client and other power relations \nencountered on a daily basis, (ii) political interference \nin public security and decision making, (iii) standards of \nperformance and integrity in judicial and administrative \ndecision making,\u0004 (iv) the quality of equitable standards \nof  the  informal  justice  sector,  (v)  corruption,  (vi)  the \nquality of laws and lawmaking, and (vii) inconsistencies \nbetween formal law and traditional values.\n\nComplex Power Relationships\nComplex power relationships and social dynamics are \nby no means unique to developing nations. However, in \n\n\u0004  Administrative law is the body of law governing the admin-\nistrative functions of government agencies. Administrative \ndecision making refers to a decision made in relation to an \nadministrative power, for example whether to grant a water \nlicense. If a person disagrees with an administrative decision, \nhe or she can ask an administrative body to review the admin-\nistrative decision. Administrative procedures typically involve a \nperson appearing before a decision maker and asking him or \nher to make a decision on a claim. In this regard, they operate \nsimilarly to courts of law.\n\nAppendix 1\n\n37\n\nthe focus countries, there are a number of factors that \nintensify the difficulties that women, the poor, religious \nand ethnic minorities, and other marginalized groups \nexperience when dealing with legal and administrative \nauthorities and decision-making bodies. Such factors \ninclude economic development challenges; hierarchical \nsocial structures; patron\u2013client relations that place one \nparty in a position of greater influence or authority over \nthe other, with an ability to make decisions or take ac-\ntions on a one-off basis that confers no benefit to simi-\nlarly placed individuals; corruption; and encroachment \nof political and other powerful actors on independent \nauthorities and decision-making bodies. \n\nAmong these factors, patron\u2013client relations are \nparticularly  problematic  because  they  may  result  in \ndisputes being resolved on an ad hoc and consequently \ninconsistent  basis.  For  example,  two  individuals  that \nface the identical problem of security of title to property \nmay experience very different results. One may keep her \nproperty, while the other woman loses hers. The only \ndifference between the women is their relationship with \npolitical actors or other decision-making authorities that \nare positioned to make arbitrary decisions that favor \none contestant or applicant over another.\n\nQuality of Formal Legal and Institutional Decision \nMaking and/or Legal Services\nIn some cases, problems affecting the efficiency and/or \nintegrity of the courts, administrative tribunals, licensing \nagencies, or other decision-making bodies affect disad-\nvantaged groups in the same way that they affect the \ncommunity at large. Their poor standard of performance \nsupersedes any specific biases that affect women, the \npoor,  or  others  more  particularly.  Examples  include:  \n(i) in many countries, including Bangladesh, there is back-\nlog of cases choking the lower and higher courts; and  \n(ii) when judges lack adequate professional training or \nthe government fails to publish information on appellate \ncases that set new precedents for the lower courts, it \nis more likely there will be unjust and inequitable deci-\nsions made. Similar problems affect the performance \nof  administrative  tribunals  or  other  decision-making \nbodies. They may fail to follow consistent standards, or \naccept or demand bribes to secure a particular result \nor expedite proceedings that could otherwise drag on \nfor months. \n\nPoor financial resources expose disadvantaged peo-\nple to incompetent or dishonest legal representation  \n\n\f38\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nbecause they cannot afford good quality legal repre-\nsentation. In other cases, legal professionals\u2019 attitudes \nand perspectives can further constrain access to justice. \nFor example, the majority of lawyers have minimal con-\ntact with disadvantaged populations. In some cases, \nthis reflects basic economic reality\u2014lawyers tend to \nwork for clients who can afford to pay standard market \nrates. In other contexts, personal beliefs may influence \nwhat cases a lawyer is prepared to work on. If a lawyer \nis a traditionalist, they may be motivated to focus on \nand  preserve  traditional  legal  norms.  This  becomes \nproblematic where the client needs to challenge the \ntraditional legal norms. Some of the difficulties stem \nfrom the culture of legal education in developing coun-\ntries. Formal legal education programs tend to focus \non students developing a technical understanding of \nthe laws only.\u0004 Law students are not encouraged to \ncritically review the law or consider whether the laws \nare just and equitable, particularly in relation to the \npoor  and  whether  the  law  advances  their  interests. \nFortunately, with the growing interest in clinical legal \neducation and students\u2019 internships with civil society \norganizations, there is scope for students to develop \na broader appreciation of the operation of law and \njustice.\n\nQuality of Informal Justice Alternatives\nIn  Bangladesh,  Indonesia,  Pakistan,  and  other  devel-\noping  Asian  countries,  the  informal  justice  system \nhas far greater relevance to the economic means and \nother  circumstances  of  disadvantaged  groups.  While \ngovernment  agencies  have  assumed  a  role  in  some \ncountries\u2014for example, by promoting court-annexed \nmediation to encourage parties to a formal case to reach \nan amicable out-of-court settlement that reduces the \nadministrative  burden  on  the  court  system\u2014in  most \ndeveloping  countries,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) lead the way in facilitating public access to the \ninformal justice sector. ADR is one of the most popular \ninformal mechanisms for resolving legal problems in a \ntime- and cost-efficient manner.\n\nWhen compared to the formal legal and adminis-\ntrative systems, the most positive features of ADR are \ntime and cost efficiency. ADR mediation sessions can \nalso have broader social sanction benefits, especially \nif they are open to an audience of onlookers as some \n\n\u0004  This observation is based on the project team\u2019s experience in \n\nworking in the focus countries.\n\nare in the focus countries. In such cases, the sessions \nreinforce the importance of values of fairness, com-\npromise, and gender equality. Notwithstanding these \npositive factors, experience across Asia and other parts \nof the world has demonstrated that the quality and \nintegrity of justice rendered by ADR can be compro-\nmised by a combination of factors. The process and \nfacilitators are susceptible to the negative influences \nthat arise where different sets of rules and different \ntypes of individuals are involved in conducting differ-\nent ADR procedures. \n\nBased on recent research by The Asia Foundation in  \nBangladesh,  certain  factors  emerged  as  potentially \nnegative  influences  on  the  ADR  process,  which  are \nconsistent  with  similar  challenges  in  Indonesia  and \nPakistan.4 First, there is a tendency for ADR sessions to \nassume the dynamic of arbitration rather than media-\ntion. In a mediation, the mediator tries to get the par-\nties to settle the matter but does not make a decision \nor impose terms of settlement. In an arbitration, the \narbitrator may impose terms of settlement on either or \nboth parties. This increases the likelihood that the parties \nwill view the settlement terms as unjust or inequitable, \nor not observe them in the long term. Second, there \nis a lack of adherence to legal norms or other practical \nconsiderations,  increasing  the  risk  that  traditional  or \nconservative values will take precedence over the law \nor common sense solutions. Many community legal ser-\nvice NGOs that specialize in ADR advocate for applying \nlegal norms to the ADR process to replace traditional \nnorms that disadvantage women and the poor. In this \ncontext,  mediations  can  become  constrained.  Rather \nthan focusing on negotiating in good faith and reaching \na compromise so that the parties can move on from a \ndispute, some NGOs have rigidly applied legal principles \nand advised their clients not to settle matters. The Foun-\ndation has found that some NGOs tend to compromise \non certain issues, such as the amount of dower to be \npaid by a husband to his wife. In most cases, the amount \nis settled by mutual compromise based on ability to pay \nrather than the amount originally specified in a marriage \ncontract. The Foundation has also observed that political \nbiases and interests and gender bias have tainted the \nconduct and/or judgment of mediators.\n\n4  The Asia Foundation. \u0004007. Promoting Improved Access to \nJustice: Community Legal Service Delivery in Bangladesh. \nCommissioned by the United Kingdom Department for Inter-\nnational Development (DFID).\n\n\fIf an ADR settlement is not honored, the parties \nhave a variety of options. Broadly speaking, these fall \ninto two major categories: social pressure and legal \nsanction. Some ADR approaches are more effective at \nharnessing community opinion and therefore exert a \nweight of authority sufficient to compel the long-term \ncompliance with settlement terms. ADR approaches \nthat  involve  local  members  of  the  community,  and \nthat have earned a reputation as trusted community \ninstitutions, hold more weight and there is more social \npressure or community sanction to ensure that a settle-\nment is complied with. Other processes are easier to \nuphold via legal means, including requests for police \ninvolvement. ADR mechanisms, such as village courts \nand  certain  NGO  ADR  processes,  involve  the  com-\nmunity to a far lesser degree but have easier access to \nenforcement measures based in law, including court \norders and police action.\n\nFinally, ADR processes can and do have an impact \non the culture of the communities in which they op-\nerate.  Returning  to  the  example  of  Bangladesh,  the \npotential for various ADR approaches to replace and/or \nimprove upon traditional shalish panels, and thus to be \nsustainable in the long term, depends in large part on \ntheir acceptance by the community. Certain ADR ap-\nproaches are better positioned to effect social change \nat the local level, and these same changes in values \nwill make it more likely that community members will \ncontinue to conduct ADR on their own, accept ADR \nsettlements,  and/or  enforce  compliance  with  these \nsettlements  after  donor-funded  NGO  assistance  has \nended. ADR approaches may be assessed according to \nthe likelihood of (i) female participation on mediation \npanels, (ii) the prospect of wider community participa-\ntion on the panels, and (iii) their potential for instilling \nhuman rights values or to secure gradual changes in \ntraditional societal norms and values more broadly.\n\nIn  some  cases,  the  challenges  associated  with \ninformal justice are much simpler than those just dis-\ncussed. Even if NGOs and other facilitators of access \nto the informal justice system have developed systems \nthat minimize the risk of gender bias or power imbal-\nances  among  disputants,  the  outreach  of  services \nmay not be sufficient to serve the entire population. \nBangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan have developed \nstrong systems of informal justice and mechanisms to \nfacilitate access, yet remote corners of each country are \ninadequately served by community legal service NGOs \nor other support mechanisms.\n\nAppendix 1\n\n3939\n\nPoorly Drafted Laws and Regulations\nAn additional constraint of a more technical nature is \nthe prevalence of unclear, inconsistent, and outdated \nlaws that may be a century or more old and no longer \nrelevant to the circumstances of women and other dis-\nadvantaged groups. A combination of factors fuel this \nproblem, including education standards, professional \ncompetency, and international pressure to adopt new \nlaws that are modeled on laws from other legal systems. \nEach of the focus countries also has a complex legal sys-\ntem that fuses together laws dating from their colonial, \ncommon-law pasts with Islamic laws and a civil code. \nThis creates another layer of complexity. Administrative \nlaws that regulate private and governmental relations \nare especially subject to conflicts and inconsistency, in-\ncluding overlapping responsibilities among different ex-\necutive agencies. In addition, the national legal systems \ncan be inconsistent with indigenous laws and therefore \noverride them, meaning that indigenous communities \nmay misunderstand their rights and entitlements. For \nexample, there may be a conflict between indigenous \nnotions of common property or community stewardship \nof land and the national legal system\u2019s protection of \nproperty ownership following formal land registration, \nwhich creates a right to exclusive use and possession \nby the landowner. \n\nInconsistency between Formal Law  \nand Traditional Values\nAccess to justice and citizen participation in public de-\ncision making by disadvantaged populations is further \nimpeded  by  traditional  community  norms  and  other \ndeeply ingrained attitudes. For example, a female victim \nof domestic violence may be discouraged from seeking \nlegal protection from an abusive husband because she is \nintimidated by fierce public norms that relegate women \nto a subservient place in society. Similarly, the police may \nbe hesitant to intervene in domestic violence matters, \nbelieving  instead  that  domestic  tensions  or  violence \nare personal matters to which formal legal protections \ndo not extend. \n\nFailure to Implement Sound Laws and Regulations \nor to Follow Prescribed Procedural Standards\nOne  of  the  most  common  constraints  to  just  legal \noutcomes and sound governance standards in devel-\noping countries is the failure on the part of judges, \nadministrative  actors,  and  other  decision  makers  to \ncorrectly apply the requirements of sound laws, regu-\n\n\f40\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nlations,  or  procedural  standards.  While  the  laws  of \nBangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and other countries \nare, for most part, well-conceived and clear in their \ndirection, they are routinely ignored by those tasked \nwith applying them, or manipulated to yield different \nresults in different cases, with no consistency of prac-\ntice and outcomes among those whose circumstances \nare identical. \n\nHighest-Order Constraints\n\nThe  highest  level  of  constraints  transcends  individual \nproblems and solutions and affects women and other \ndisadvantaged groups as underclasses of society. These \nconstraints  mean  that  even  if  a  poor  woman  from \nrural  Pakistan  overcomes  the  low-  and  middle-order \nconstraints,  her  quest  for  justice  may  ultimately  be \nthwarted by factors lying beyond her personal control \nand that of her legal representatives. The highest-order \nconstraints lie in traditions of patronage, cronyism, or \nelite indifference, and policy issues that generate legal \nproblems or administrative barriers that affect disadvan-\ntaged populations on a large scale faster than support \nmechanisms can resolve individual cases.\n\nIt  is  common  for  public  officials  that  exercise \nlegal  or  administrative  decision-making  authority  to \noperate with indifference to the needs of marginal-\nized populations. Unless a poor woman has personal \nlinks to the government agency or official overseeing \nher case or application, she may be unable to obtain \nthe information or result that she seeks. This extreme \ncronyism plays a powerful role in developing countries, \nwhere close personal relations have a pervasive influ-\nence on decision making, resource allocation, rights \nand privileges of access, and the pace and outcomes \nof legal and administrative procedures. Judges and ad-\nministrative officials may exercise their decision-making \nauthority on basis of kinship, friendship, associations \nfrom student days, or common regional backgrounds. \nSuch relationships can yield positive results for a dis-\nadvantaged individual who has a relationship with a \nperson of relative stature and authority in her com-\nmunity, where they grant her special favor. But, that \npositive result is wholly arbitrary because another dis-\nadvantaged person in identical circumstances, but who \nlacks the personal relationship, is unlikely to achieve \nthe same result. Where judges or other officials owe \ntheir positions to political leaders or other persons of \ninfluence as a result of a personal favor, they are bound \n\nto exercise their decision-making authority in a manner \nthat protects the interests of the person who granted \nthem their position.\n\nLegal and Administrative Constraints \nAffecting Sector Development Programs\n\nThe preceding section discussed the three-tiered hier-\narchy  of  constraints  that  women  and  disadvantaged \ngroups face in accessing justice. However, women and \ndisadvantaged  groups  also  face  these  types  of  con-\nstraints when trying to access national development ini-\ntiatives and their ensuing benefits. Therefore, attention \nnow turns to the kinds of practical program activities or \ninterventions that are undertaken to facilitate the legal \nempowerment of the disadvantaged.\n\nLegal Empowerment Interventions\n\nWhile the activities are discussed as separate interven-\ntions, it is important to note that in practice these tools \nare  seldom  applied  as  stand-alone  interventions.  As \nsuch,  a  well-conceived  legal  empowerment  strategy \nwill  typically  include  a  multipronged  combination  of \nconcurrent interventions. \n\nIn light of the ascending hierarchy of constraints \nto access justice, it is useful to think of legal empow-\nerment program interventions on an ascending scale \nof sophistication. The scale (i) begins with the most \nbasic  interventions,  (ii)  continues  through  middle-\norder  interventions  that  focus  on  problems  faced \nby individuals and use a combination of formal and \ninformal support mechanisms, and (iii) ends with the \nhighest-order strategies that focus on the policy con-\nstraints that persist irrespective of progress in resolving \nindividual cases. The legal empowerment activities may \nbe characterized as basic awareness raising; formal and \ninformal support activities that benefit individuals, but \nnot necessarily classes of similarly placed individuals; \nand activities that aim to change entire communities\u2019 \nrelationship  with  the  law  and  broader  structures  of \nadministrative governance. \n\nThe third category of activities is the new and most \npromising frontier of legal empowerment initiatives. \nThese program interventions are not well studied or \ndocumented. They aim to equip entire classes or dis-\nadvantaged communities with the capacity to use legal \nand administrative remedies creatively, confidently, and \nindependently. The initiatives also aim to address the \n\n\fpolicy or other constraints that spawn new challenges \nas  fast  as  individual  problems  are  resolved  through \nmiddle-tier interventions. \n\nFirst-Order Strategies and \nInterventions\u2014Basic Awareness Raising\n\nThere  has  been  a  shift  in  the  approach  toward  legal \nempowerment  initiatives,  and  this  is  reflected  in  the \ndevelopment  of  new  terminology.  The  term  \u201clegal \nempowerment\u201d  has  replaced  \u201clegal  literacy\u201d  as  the \npreferred term. Legal empowerment is used to describe \nthe process of equipping disadvantaged groups with \nthe capacity to use the law and broader structures of \nadministrative  governance,  resource  allocation,  and \ndecision making to advance their social, economic, and \npolitical circumstances. Legal empowerment is an excit-\ning tool that gives a measure of power to disadvantaged \ngroups to protect their rights. It goes beyond the old \nconcept of legal literacy, which was merely to educate \nthe population about their legal rights. However, legal \nliteracy remains an excellent term to describe the first \ntier  of  program  interventions,  which  aim  to  educate \nthe  public  about  (i)  its  legal  rights  and  obligations;  \n(ii) the institutional structure and procedures of the legal \nsystem; and (iii) the mechanisms that women, the poor, \nand other marginalized groups can use to advance their \nrights and interests. \n\nThis  first  category  of  interventions  is  discussed \n\nbelow. \n\nUsing Print and Broadcast Media\nThe  community  legal  service  and  development  orga-\nnizations that pioneered legal literacy work aimed to \nprovide  disadvantaged  populations  with  a  general \nunderstanding of their rights under the law in Bangla-\ndesh,  Indonesia,  Pakistan,  and  other  Asian  countries \nby using print media as their primary tool for dissemi-\nnating information. Pamphlets, posters, comic books, \nnewspapers, and other publications serve as practical, \ncost-efficient media for sharing basic legal information \ntargeting general audiences. For example, Bangladeshi \nNGOs  posted  anti-domestic  violence  posters  on  the \nwalls  of  community  centers,  teahouses,  and  market \nstalls.  Print  media  can  also  be  easily  tailored  to  the \ncircumstances  of  different  target  audiences.  For  ex-\nample, cartoon images can replace conventional text in \nconveying messages to communities with poor literacy. \nGeneral messages may be developed in the principal \n\nAppendix 1\n\n41\n\nnational language and then adapted to the language \nof  indigenous  populations.  In  Bangladesh  and  other \ncountries, newspapers have started devoting a weekly \nsection or column to legal issues, with feature articles, \ninvestigative  reports,  and  frequently  asked  questions \non topical legal issues.\n\nTapping Television and Radio Outreach\nTelevision (TV) and radio serve as increasingly important \nmedia for national information dissemination. For ex-\nample, for many years Bangladesh only had one, state-\noperated TV network but now has more than a dozen \nprivate  TV  channels  that  reach  secondary  cities  and \nadjacent areas. At one time, the geographic outreach \nand  broadcast  hours  of  radio  exceeded  those  of  TV. \nToday, TV has achieved the largest geographic footprint \nof media outreach and is recognized as the preferred \nmedia for information sharing through public service \nannouncements and dedicated programming on spe-\ncific legal or governance issues. While the TV and radio \nmarket has yet to reach every household in developing \ncountries,  TVs  and  radios  are  now  common  fixtures \nin village community centers, tea shops, bazaars, and \nother public gathering places. People assemble in these \nplaces in their leisure hours to watch TV, listen to radio \nprograms,  and  discuss  the  content  of  public  service \nannouncements and talk shows.\n\nA principal advantage of TV and radio is that they \nappeal  to  a  broad  audience  and  serve  a  combined \nentertainment and educational function. Those who \nmight easily tire of formal training programs are more \ncontent to receive information through public service \nannouncements,  docudramas,  and  other  broadcast \nmedia  formats.  While  the  sophistication  of  TV  and \nradio messages must be adjusted for different audi-\nences,  they  are  more  effective  than  print  media  at \ndelivering  messages  to  rural  communities  with  low \nliteracy levels. \n\nPopular Culture\nMusical performances, karaoke combinations of popular \nmelodies and serious messages, stand-up comedy, street \ntheater,  poster  art  competitions,  and  other  forms  of \npopular culture serve as proven media for legal infor-\nmation dissemination across Asia. The combination of \nentertainment  and  serious  messages  captures  viewer \nand  listener  attention.  Experience  has  demonstrated \nthat some degree of follow-up by NGOs or other fa-\ncilitators may be necessary to ensure that messages are \n\n\f42\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nclearly  understood  and  that  beneficiaries  receive  the \nadditional details necessary to act successfully on the \ninformation provided. For example, in rural Cambodia, \na  popular  traveling  musical  comedy  performance  on \ndomestic violence issues supported by The Asia Foun-\ndation  in  \u0004998  was  adjusted  to  include  a  facilitated \ndiscussion and information booth at the end of each \nsession.\u0004 This provided follow-up support to members of  \nthe  audience  needing  NGO  support  to  address  the \nproblem of domestic violence in local communities. \n\nInternet and Other Electronic Media\nIn  the  last  few  years,  legal  empowerment  practi-\ntioners  have  harnessed  the  power  of  the  internet, \nmobile  telephone  messaging,  and  other  informa-\ntion  and  communications  technology  tools  to  share \ninformation.  For  example,  Indonesia\u2019s  hukumonline.\ncom\u0004  has  created  a  niche  as  an  online  clearing-\nhouse  providing  information  on  legal  reform  issues, \njudicial  decisions,  and  legislation.  In  Bangladesh,  \nmobile telephone providers are supporting the Bangla-\ndesh Election Commission\u2019s efforts to establish a new \nnational electoral role. They are using mobile telephone \nmessaging technology to share information on registra-\ntion centers with mobile subscribers. \n\nSecond-Order Strategies and \nInterventions\u2014Resolving Individual \nProblems through Formal and Informal \nJustice Systems\n\nSecond-tier  legal  empowerment  interventions  are \nlargely  focused  on  resolving  the  legal  problems  and \nadministrative challenges faced by women and other \ndisadvantaged  groups.  Program  interventions  of  this \nkind are primarily in the domain of community legal \nservice  organizations  that  provide  legal  information, \nlegal  aid  services,  facilitate  ADR,  and  provide  other \ninformal justice services. Some NGOs also provide legal \nsupport services as an integrated component of their \nbroader community development work. These organi-\nzations range from large, national-level organizations \nsuch as Yayasan Lembaga Bantuan Hukum Indonesia, \nthe Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, and the \nAurat Publication and Information Service Foundation \n\n\u0004  The Asia Foundation. Undated. Combating Domestic Violence \n\nin Cambodia: Public Education through Street Theater. \n\n\u0004  Hukum Online. www.hukumonline.com.\n\nin Pakistan, to smaller community-based organizations. \nWithin the second tier of legal empowerment activities, \nprogram activities are concentrated in the informal or \nformal justice sectors, or combinations of both. \n\nCommunity-Based Training\nCommunity-based legal training takes information of \nthe kind imparted through mass print and broadcast \nmedia and adapts it for targeted delivery and engage-\nment  with  citizens  at  the  community  level.  It  tends \nto be more intensive, hands-on, and interactive than \nmedia-based  interventions.  Community-based  train-\ning  targets  the  specific  needs  of  select  communities \nand  allows  legal  empowerment  providers  to  work \nclosely  with  particular  beneficiary  groups.  This,  in \nturn,  enables  providers  to  understand  the  problems \nfaced by beneficiaries better and to design and imple-\nment strategies to assist them. In some countries, law \nschools  offer  students  opportunities  to  participate  in  \ncommunity-based  training  as  a  component  of  clini-\ncal  legal  education  programs.  While  some  training \ninitiatives  promote  general  legal  awareness,  they  are \nespecially relevant to development projects that focus \non the legal problems of specific beneficiary groups and \non the role of government officials in solving problems \nof this kind.\n\nCommunity Counseling\nIn  some  cases,  community-based  training  extends  to \ninclude basic legal counseling services, marking the first \nstep in the transition from basic information sharing to \nhands-on support services. Some legal service provid-\ners refer to these periodic legal counseling sessions as \n\u201clegal aid camps.\u201d They typically involve a small team \nof lawyers setting up a booth in a community hall or \nmarket  center  following  an  introductory  information \nsession, for which citizens queue up to seek professional \nadvice on particular problems. The advice or guidance \nprovided is generally a one-off interaction, as opposed \nto the establishment of an ongoing professional ser-\nvice  relationship  of  the  kind  created  through  formal \nlegal aid mechanisms (see below). The advice typically \nprovides an overview of the legal principles that apply \nto the particular problem faced\u2014for example, a prop-\nerty dispute between neighbors\u2014and a referral to the \nnearest community legal service organization that the \nindividual can approach for long-term action or sup-\nport.  While  this  one-off  interaction  and  information \nexchange is a modest first step toward more long-term, \n\n\fAppendix 1\n\n43\n\nsupport-oriented legal empowerment interventions, the \nbrief exchange provides clients with more information \nthan they would otherwise have received through basic \ninformation sharing.\n\ncommunity legal service delivery advance to paralegal \nroles  if  they  are  moved  by  the  experience  and  feel \ninspired to contribute.\n\nParalegal Services\nIn the ascending scale of legal empowerment interven-\ntions, paralegals have an important role in establishing \nthe first permanent legal support capacity in a disad-\nvantaged community. A paralegal is a layperson who is \nselected by a legal service organization and given (i) a \nspecialized program of training that typically includes \na general introduction to law and human rights; (ii) a \nmeasure of specialty training in particular areas such \nas family law, inheritance, or property; and (iii) guid-\nance on how to provide effective counseling support \nservices to community members. Since paralegals must \nestablish  relationships  of  trust  with  the  community \nmembers they serve, they are ideally drawn from com-\nmunities of teachers and NGO workers whose vocation \ndepends on effective relationship building, networking, \nand information sharing. They are typically assigned to \ncommunities in which they live and work, which helps \nthem to understand the local dynamics of power, con-\nflict, and decision making, and establish trust relations \nwith  community  members.  Paralegals  are  sometimes \ndrawn  from  the  beneficiaries  of  earlier  legal  support \nactivities. For example, a woman who previously ben-\nefited from the support of a legal service NGO seeks an \nopportunity to contribute in a manner similar to those \nwho helped her.\n\nParalegals are cost-effective alternatives to lawyers. \nIn some cases, they play a purely intermediary role in \nrepresenting a citizen\u2019s interests in formal or informal \nlegal proceedings. In other cases, they train community \nmembers on how to directly engage in administrative \nand  other  decision-making  procedures.  Paralegals \nmay work in a voluntary or professional capacity. Their \nareas of focus may include (i) reducing the incidence \nof domestic violence in their community through edu-\ncation, advocacy, and engagement in specific cases;  \n(ii) advising landowners on registration procedures and \nresolution of disputes regarding property boundaries; \nor (iii) facilitating license applications or other admin-\nistrative  procedures.  Professional  paralegals  tend  to \nfocus on more specialized support activities that may \ninvolve guiding community members through complex \nadministrative procedures or assuming a lead advocacy \nrole on behalf of their clients. Some beneficiaries of \n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution\nThe poor performance and prohibitive cost of courts \nand  other  formal  justice  sector  institutions  in  many \ndeveloping countries have led disadvantaged popula-\ntions  to  seek  faster,  simpler,  and  more  cost-effective  \nalternatives. ADR is more time- and cost-efficient than \nthe formal court system. It also has the potential to ren-\nder results that reflect a compromise of interests by both \nparties to the dispute as opposed to an outright victory \nof one party over the other. ADR encompasses a broad \nrange of processes designed to settle disputes outside \nthe  formal  court  setting.  The  Bangladesh  experience \nillustrates the typical scope of ADR, which includes a \nrange of traditional to quasi-governmental mechanisms. \nAlthough most of the larger community legal service \nNGOs that support ADR have gradually adopted models \nthat involve mediation sessions chaired or administered \nby panels of respected community members, variations \nexist among approaches that seem quite similar on their \nface.  For  example,  the  legal  awareness  and  training \nactivities undertaken by different NGOs vary. Similarly, \nthere is variation in the rules governing the composi-\ntion  and  chairing  of  the  ADR  panels  and  the  degree \nof  administrative  assistance  and  legal  guidance  that \ncommunity  legal  service  NGOs  (or  the  smaller  NGOs \npartnering  with  the  larger  organizations)  are  able  to \nprovide. There is little evidence that these variations in \ncommunity-based ADR processes lead to widely varying \noutcomes, although every community legal service orga-\nnization can offer a cogent rationale for the particular \napproach that it follows.\n\nContinuing  with  the  Bangladesh  example,  the \nseveral NGO models of ADR can be categorized more \nbroadly in terms of how mediation sessions are con-\nducted\u2014whether by mediators who are employees of \n(or otherwise engaged by) a community legal service \nNGO,  or  by  citizen  members  of  community-based \norganizations. Although NGOs develop and facilitate \ncommunity-based  organization  mediation  panels  in \nways that vary from one organization to the next, the \nvariations among community panels are less important \nto their effectiveness and sustainability than the fact \nthat they are not processes mediated by NGO employ-\nees. To these two categories are added two additional \nalternatives: traditional shalish and village courts.\n\n\f44\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nWhen community ADR models are examined as \na group and compared with other ADR approaches, \nmore  substantive  differences  emerge.  For  example, \nin Bangladesh, traditional shalish is the oldest estab-\nlished form of community-based dispute resolution. \nThe parties to a dispute and their family members are \nsummoned to assemble in the presence of a panel of \nvillage elders and interested observers to discuss the \nproblem  and  reach  a  conclusion.  The  shalish  panel \nmay  include  union  parishad  (municipality)  chairper-\nsons and members, as well as religious leaders or other \ncommunity leaders of influence\u2014although, in recent \nyears,  religious  leaders  are  less  likely  to  participate \nin traditional shalish. Local elites with political party \naffiliations  are  increasingly  active  in  shalish  panels, \nwhich may reflect a shift in the power balance in rural \nsociety  to  those  whose  political  connections  allows \nthem to deliver results or services. A shalish session is \nnot always completed in a single day; rather, it may \nextend  over  a  number  of  public  sessions,  and  may \ninclude  private  negotiations  between  parties  that \ntypically involve other family members. The conflicts \nreferred to ADR usually involve family matters, land \nissues between neighbors, insults or other incidents \nthat dishonor a party to the dispute, or petty theft. \nIn some cases, serious criminal cases that should be \nprosecuted through the formal court system are re-\nferred to mediation, such as rape or other crimes of \nviolence against women.\n\nThe concept of community mediation may invoke \nan  image  of  calm  and  quiet  deliberation.  In  reality, \ncommunity  ADR  sessions,  like  the  Bangladesh  sha-\nlish,  are  typically  held  in  crowded  village  commons \nor  meeting  places.  The  parties,  their  relatives,  and \nonlookers joining shalish dars (members of the panel \nthat hears the dispute) tend to offer their views and \nobservations in a cacophony of inputs. It is not unusual \nfor \u000400 or more persons to observe a shalish session. \nWhere the dispute involves a female party, she may \nbe confined to the home or a distant vantage point \nwhile her father, brother, or other male relative appears \non her behalf in the session. Whether the conduct of \na  particular  shalish  session  is  best  characterized  as \nmediation, arbitration, or a fusion of the two hinges \non the nature of the particular dispute and the par-\nties involved. Community mores and the opinions of \npowerful leaders often exert such a strong influence \n\nthat outcomes are literally imposed on a party to the \ndispute in a court-like manner that may be contrary \nto his or her wishes. \n\nCommunity  dispute  resolution  is  often  the  first \nand  only  option  available  to  poor  and  marginal-\nized citizens who lack the resources and social and \nadministrative connections to pursue formal dispute \nresolution mechanisms. It is affordable, comprehen-\nsible, convenient, and efficient, even in contrast with \na well-functioning judicial system. It also has a par-\nticipatory dimension that confers a degree of social \nsanction to decisions reached by the mediation panel. \nIn  recent  years,  court-annexed  mediation  has  been \nintroduced in an effort to reduce the administrative \nburden on the courts.\n\nLegal Aid\nThe middle-order mechanisms discussed in the preced-\ning sections are primarily based in the informal justice \nsector. Pro-bono legal aid services by lawyers shift legal \nempowerment from the informal justice sector to the \nformal sector. Free or subsidized legal aid services lower \na major economic barrier to the formal justice system, \nand make it possible to bring justiciable issues to court \nthat would otherwise not find their way through the \nnet of prohibitive costs, chronic delays, and requisite \nenabling connections. Certain categories of cases, such \nas crimes of violence against women, are sometimes \nreferred to mediation that should properly be  adju-\ndicated before the courts. Legal aid is most effective \nin resolving justiciable issues that should properly be \nplaced before the courts. While legal aid occupies an \nimportant niche that has been well-served by organiza-\ntions like Yayasan Lembaga Bantuan Hukum Indonesia \nand the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, and \nby  government  mechanisms  such  as  the  National \nLegal Aid Foundation in Bangladesh, a combination \nof factors can limit its impact. These include limits in \nthe number of lawyers that are prepared to give up a \nportion of their practice to undertake legal aid work \nor  to  forego  better  income-earning  prospects  and \npursue a full-time career in legal aid; inconsistencies \nin  the  professional  competence  and  quality  of  ser-\nvices rendered by legal aid lawyers; and the broader \nfactors affecting the quality of judicial decision mak-\ning  that  affect  legal  aid  cases  together  with  others \nbefore the courts, including corruption, poor judicial \n\n\fadministration,  and  variations  in  the  professional  \nstandards and competence of judges. \n\nHighest-Order Strategies  \nand Interventions\n\nThe basic and second-order categories of legal empow-\nerment interventions described in the preceding section \nspan basic legal awareness raising without reference to \nindividual  circumstances,  and  specific  client-focused \nsupport activities in the formal and informal sectors that \naim to resolve the legal or administrative problems of \nindividuals. Both areas of focus play an important role \nin  changing  the  relationship  between  disadvantaged \npopulations and the law, and bring important benefits \nto the individuals served. At the same time, they are \nnot designed to have an impact on the highest-level \npolicy constraints and systemic factors that shape the \ncircumstances in which legal problems arise. They also \ndo not affect the persisting inequitable power relations \nof the kind that undermine the interests of disadvan-\ntaged groups. \n\nThe third and highest tier of legal empowerment \ninterventions focus on these higher-order challenges. \nIn so doing, they focus on advocacy, law reform initia-\ntives, and legal mechanisms that aim to benefit entire \nclasses of disadvantaged groups. They also challenge \nand reshape traditional social, religious, and cultural \nnorms and practices that relegate women, the poor, \nand other disadvantaged groups to an inferior status \nin  law,  decision  making,  resource  allocation,  and \ngovernance.\n\nPublic Interest Litigation\nPublic interest litigation aims to serve or represent large \ncategories  of  persons,  to  the  benefit  of  society  as  a \nwhole. In ruling on a public interest case, a court may \nset a precedent that guides the way in which courts will \ndetermine cases involving similar situations in the future. \nEven where such a decision is not binding, as in civil law \ncountries, it may have a de facto value as a precedent \nby virtue of the publicity it receives and the information \nthat it conveys to the general public and the judiciary. \nPublic interest litigation is typically used to address issues \nthat threaten the rights or quality of life of entire classes \nor communities of women and disadvantaged groups, \nsuch as the health risks that result from the discharge \n\nAppendix 1\n\n45\n\nof toxic industrial waste. Among Asian countries, pub-\nlic interest litigation is most widely practiced in India, \nwhere it is known as \u201csocial action litigation.\u201d A series \nof public interest cases on behalf of communities af-\nfected by the failure of Government of India agencies \nto enforce environmental laws have resulted in several \nmilestone  decisions  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  India.7 \nThese decisions recognize citizens\u2019 fundamental right to \na healthy environment. The Bangladesh Environmental \nLawyers Association and the Bangladesh Legal Aid and \nServices Trust have also initiated public interest cases \non a variety of issues.8 As their experience proves, the \nthreat of litigation is sometimes sufficient to compel a \nrecalcitrant government agency or private party to agree \nto amicably settle a dispute. However, for the threat to \ncarry weight, NGOs must only back credible claims and \nthey must be prepared to go to court if necessary. Oth-\nerwise, government agencies will dismiss their claims \nas unmeritorious attempts to harass. \n\nAdministrative Advocacy\nAs a variation on support for court cases, civil society \norganizations also assist disadvantaged communities to \npursue their interests and resolve disputes by helping \nthem to make applications to administrative tribunals. \nParties can ask the administrative tribunal to review a \ndecision made by a government department on issues \nsuch as state approval of licenses or permits. \n\nLegal Reform Advocacy and Legislative Drafting\nViolation  of  the  rights  and  security  of  women  and \nother disadvantaged groups persists in certain instances \nbecause the law fails to provide them with adequate \nprotection. Legislators may fail to respond to the rising \nincidence  of  domestic  violence,  land  grabbing,  envi-\nronmental degradation, or other issues that affect the \ndisadvantaged more than the community at large. In \n\n7  See, for example, Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v. \n\nUnion of India (\u000499\u0004) \u0004 SCC 77. Farmers who were affected \nby the pollution of the river in Andhra Pradesh, their only \nsource of irrigation, sought compensation.

Water, Law \nand The Commons. \n\n8  Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association. \u0004004.  \n\nBangladesh Enters into a New Era of Public Interest Litigation. \n\n\f46\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nsuch circumstances, it falls to civil society organizations \nto draft model legislation for the protection of women \nvictims. Civil society groups also often undertake large-\nscale public advocacy activities to raise public awareness \nof the problem; stimulate a public call for legal action; \nand support legislators in drafting and passing laws by \nproviding technical assistance, mobilization of media \ncoverage, and other support. \n\nPioneering Public\u2013Private Partnerships\nThe  sequenced  legal  empowerment  interventions \ndescribed in the preceding sections tend to be under-\ntaken primarily by community legal service, advocacy, \nand  other  civil  society  organizations.  Implicit  in  this \nundertaking are the typical dynamics of engagement \nbetween  civil  society  organizations  and  government \nagencies and officials. Historically, these relationships \nhave been marked by reciprocal tensions and mistrust \nthat affect the prospect of compromise. Despite these \nchallenges,  examples  have  emerged  in  recent  years \nof  cooperative working relations  between NGOs and \ngovernment agencies in working toward judicial reform \nin  Indonesia,  establishing  community-oriented  polic-\ning programs in Bangladesh, and formulating a joint \nresponse to disaster victims in Pakistan. \n\nAs noted previously, legal empowerment interven-\ntions are also relevant to public officials and agencies. \nLegal empowerment goals are enhanced by reducing \nor eliminating tensions and promoting opportunities \nfor government, civil society, and other stakeholder \ngroups to cooperate. Where tensions are reduced, \nthere is greater prospect of compromise, and where \nall stakeholders are prepared to yield some ground for \nthe sake of compromise, the prospect of productive \npublic\u2013private partnerships between government and \ncivil society increases. Until recently, there have been \nrelatively few examples of public\u2013private partnership \nin advancing legal empowerment goals in Bangladesh,  \nIndonesia, and Pakistan. The situation reflected his-\ntorical tensions between government agencies and \nofficials and civil society actors. In recent years, some \nencouraging examples of public\u2013private partnership \nhave  emerged  where  prospective  partners  were \nwilling to set traditional tensions aside and advance \ncommon interests. One example is the cooperation \nbetween  public  agencies  and  civil  society  groups \nin  Indonesia  in  undertaking  a  governance  audit  of \nthe Supreme Court of Indonesia and in developing \n\nregulations  for  the  introduction  of  court-annexed \nmediation.9\n\nBenefits of Legal Empowerment\n\nA growing body of empirical evidence joins a wealth \nof  anecdotal  findings  in  demonstrating  that  legal \nempowerment  helps  to  advance  good  governance, \npoverty reduction, and other benefits of importance to \nADB and like-minded development partners. The legal \nempowerment process helps to overcome the crucial \nconstraints to access to justice and encourages citizens \nto  participate  in  lobbying  for  change  in  governance \nprinciples  that  undermine  poverty  reduction  efforts \nin Asia and other parts of the world. In this context, \npoverty reduction must be understood as being more \nthan merely increasing income or materially improving \nthe circumstances of the poor. It also encompasses the \ninformed participation by the poor and other marginal-\nized populations in decisions that affect their lives, and \ntheir improved access to resources and opportunities. \nWhen legal empowerment effects citizen or community \nparticipation  in  public  decision-making  processes,  it \ncontributes to good governance. As noted above, the \nimpact of legal empowerment ranges in sophistication \nand scope from imparting basic knowledge of law and \nrights, through the resolution of individual legal prob-\nlems and governance constraints, to raising the capacity \nof disadvantaged populations to confidently apply the \nskills and knowledge acquired to engage in legal and \nother public decision-making processes.\n\nBasic Impact \n\nIncreased General Awareness of Rights  \nand Legal Protection\nAt a most basic level, legal empowerment helps women \nand  other  disadvantaged  groups  to  appreciate  that \nthey have rights and obligations under the law\u2014even \n\n9  The Indonesian Institute for Independent Judiciary was es-\n\ntablished in \u0004999 by human rights lawyers and has continu-\nally pressured the Government of Indonesia to establish a \nconcrete agenda for law reform. The Asia Foundation has also \nsupported the Indonesian Institute for Independent Judiciary \nto conduct an institutional audit of the Supreme Court in \ncollaboration with the court. The aim of the audit has been to \nidentify priority institutional and procedural reforms.\n\n\fif they have only the most general sense of what these \nare. This basic awareness is different than the specific \nlegal  knowledge  discussed  below,  although  the  two \nconcepts may overlap in practice. The difference is that \ndisadvantaged  populations  can  learn  that  they  have \nrights even if they do not fully understand the nature \nand implications of those rights. \n\nIncreased Knowledge of Specific Legal Rights  \nand Issues\nTransferring legal knowledge to the disadvantaged is a \nvery basic contribution of legal empowerment. It can in-\nvolve educating people about specific laws, regulations, \nconstitutional provisions, and even milestone court rul-\nings that have a direct bearing on their status or rights \nas citizens. It is not necessary to educate citizens to the \npoint that they can cite the terms of particular laws or \nrights. It may be enough that a daughter can confidently \nstate that she is legally entitled to inherit a portion of her \ndeceased parents\u2019 land, or that a woman understands \nthat she must register her marriage to secure her legal \nrights if her marriage later breaks down.\n\nIntermediate Impact \n\nImproved Access to the Formal and Informal Legal \nSystem and Public Decision-Making Processes\nOrganization, education, and access to legal services \npsychologically and politically empower marginalized \ngroups  in  ways  that  translate  into  confident  action. \nBehavioral change of this kind is a central goal of many \nlegal empowerment efforts. Where physical, political, or \neconomic factors are too strong for individuals to chal-\nlenge, legal work combines with allied efforts such as \ncommunity organizing to encourage and equip disad-\nvantaged groups to act on what they have learned. The \nvery fact that people assemble in a group is a potentially \nimportant  advance  in  behavior.  For  example,  when \ncitizens  collectively  and  cohesively  assert  themselves \nthrough  the  medium  of  local  microcredit  groups  or \nother informal associations, it increases their political \nclout\u2014making it more difficult for those who oppose \ntheir views to dismiss or ignore them.\n\nEnhanced  citizen  participation  in  development \nplanning  and  project  implementation  brings  positive \nbenefits. For example, citizen monitoring helps to ensure \nthat (i) development efforts stay on course, (ii) projects \ndo not prove counterproductive, (iii) the government \n\nAppendix 1\n\n47\n\npersonnel involved in projects remain accountable and \nresponsive, and (iv) beneficiaries stay committed to ini-\ntiatives that require their sustained engagement. More \nbroadly,  understanding  relevant  laws  and  processes \nhelps secure effective participation in all stages of de-\nvelopment project cycles. It also can check the downside \nof development, such as environmental damage, and \ncontribute to accountability on the part of both govern-\nment parties and influential private actors.\n\nThe  value  of  participation  in  law  reform  efforts \ndoes  not  lie  purely  in  the  actual  achievement  of \nchanges  in  laws  or  regulations,  as  discussed  below. \nThere is equal value in the very process of engagement \nand the public debate that flows from it. Although law \nreform efforts are not always successful, the strategic \nengagement  involved  in  pursuing  changes  in  the \nlaw  can  have  an  important  empowering  effect.  For \nexample,  reform  initiatives  can  bring  otherwise  dis-\nparate groups together in the context of coalitions or \nother joint efforts through which they articulate their \ndemands, table draft legislation, or establish a sound \nbasis for future cooperation.\n\nEnhancement of Practical Legal Skills\nLegal  empowerment  helps  to  impart  the  basic  legal \nskills that the disadvantaged need to apply their legal \nknowledge. It is one thing to know one\u2019s legal rights but \nquite another to know how and where to assert them. \nAlthough disadvantaged persons may have a general \nawareness or specific knowledge of the law, they still \nmay not know how to effectively use it. For example, a \nman may know that he has a right to appeal a decision \nto  reject  his  application  for  a  national  identity  card. \nDespite this, he may have no idea what government \noffice to approach to launch his appeal, how to docu-\nment his claim, or what steps to follow in pursuing it. \nSimilarly,  a  woman  may  understand  that  registering \nher marriage with the government can benefit her if an \nabusive husband later orders her and their children to \nleave the family home. But, if neither she nor someone \nshe  knows  is  familiar  with  the  marriage  registration \nprocess, her basic knowledge has little value. \n\nAlthough understanding the basic processes rep-\nresents skills acquisition, it does not amount to under-\nstanding the substance of laws (although knowledge \nof  laws  may  be  a  precursor  to  skills  development). \nSome  skills  are  very  basic,  such  as  knowing  what \ngovernment  agency  to  approach  and  whom  to  talk \n\n\f48\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nto  there. However, there are many legal procedures \nthat  involve  more  sophisticated  tasks  that  require  a \ngreater  degree  of  competency  than  just  having  the \nbasic  skills,  such  as  preparing  affidavits  and  formal \npleadings, gathering evidence to support the claim, \ndealing with police or other government officials, or \nnegotiating legal disputes with private parties. \n\nGiven the level of sophistication involved, it is often \nmore efficient for paralegals to develop specialty legal \nskills than for large numbers of disadvantaged citizens \nto invest time in acquiring them. Accordingly, from a \nstrategic program perspective, it can be more practical \nand cost-effective to invest in the intensive training of \nparalegals as opposed to entire communities. Improved \npublic  access  to  the  legal  system  can  be  facilitated \nthrough the work of paralegals, as they guide or assist \ncitizens through complex legal procedures. \n\nHighest-Order Impact \n\nIncreased Confidence and Higher Expectations\nBuilding general legal awareness contributes to behavior \nchange, which in turn renders the disadvantaged more \ndisposed  to  acquiring  specific  knowledge  and  skills, \nmore confident in their ability to apply the knowledge \nand skills that they acquire, and more likely to voice their \nexpectations in demanding responsible action by public \nofficials and agencies. The distinction drawn between \nlegal awareness and behavior change sometimes breaks \ndown in practice\u2014that is, the realization that one has \nrights can be one and the same process as assuming a \nwillingness to assert them.\n\nSuccessful Participation in Legal Implementation \nand Public Decision Making\nLegal empowerment plays an important role in improv-\ning  the  implementation of  laws.  This  typically  results \nfrom  informed  participation  by  affected  populations \nin  legal  and  governmental  processes  and  decisions. \nGroup  mobilization,  in  particular,  helps  to  secure \nimplementation.  Where  relations  among  NGOs,  the \ncommunities that they serve, and government officials \nare open and collaborative, such mobilization helps to \nadvance state\u2013civil sector cooperation, or bring public \npressure to bear on officials to do their jobs responsi-\nbly. The outcome need not be a national-level political \ndecision  framed  in  legal  terms.  Improvements  in  the \nperformance  and  accessibility  of  local  government \nagencies and procedures can have an equally significant \n\nimpact on the quality of life of disadvantaged citizens. \nThis  is  particularly  so  in  Indonesia,  where  a  national \npolicy  commitment  to  decentralization  makes  local \ngovernment increasingly relevant to day-to-day public \nexperience. Legal empowerment programs can also help \ndisadvantaged communities to inform local government \ndecision making in resource allocation and other actions \nof interest to citizens.\n\nParticipation in Law, Regulatory,  \nand Budgetary Reform\nLegal  empowerment  mobilizes  the  disadvantaged  to \nhelp shape legislation and resource allocation. This in-\nvolves enabling people to identify problems with existing \nlaws, rather than simply accepting them regardless of \nquality. In some societies, including Pakistan, decisions \nof  this  kind  occur  at  the  state  or  provincial  level  in \naddition to the national level. Where decentralization \nhas  taken  place,  decision-making  authority  on  legal, \nregulatory,  and  budgetary  decisions  devolves  to  the \ncommunity  level.  While  legal  empowerment  work  is \ntypically undertaken at the community level, it may also \ntake the form of national policy advocacy, particularly \nwith regard to national law and regulatory reform. The \ndisadvantaged  are  not  necessarily  the  lead  actors  in \nthese efforts. Instead, their priorities may be articulated \nby  partner  NGOs  and  pursued  in  collaboration  with \nmiddle  class  and  elite  actors.  Where  representatives \nof disadvantaged populations participate in policy ad-\nvocacy, and their allies take account of their priorities \nand perspectives, it can be said that the disadvantaged \nstand in a different relationship with the law and legal \nsystem,  and  genuinely  participate  in  decisions  that \nshape their lives. \n\nImprovements in Material Circumstances\nLegal  empowerment  contributes  to  improvements  in \nthe material circumstances of those who benefit from \nsocioeconomic development efforts, particularly in the \ncontext  of  poverty  reduction.  Such  impact  can  take \na  variety  of  forms.  Learning  about  the  law  may  help \nwomen reduce the incidence of domestic violence in \ntheir communities. Likewise, it can help farmers take \nadvantage of agrarian reform laws in ways that increase \ntheir income. Similarly, it can help citizens understand \nthat the enforcement of laws and regulations banning \ncertain environmentally harmful practices will enhance \nquality of life and livelihood in their communities, and \nprompt them to take appropriate action.\n\n\fAppendix 1\n\n49\n\nTable A1.1: Summary of Constraints and Legal Empowerment Interventions \n\nConstraints Facing \nWomen and Other Disadvantaged \nGroups\n\nBasic Constraints\n\nLegal \nEmpowerment \nInterventions\n\nBenefits \nof Legal\nEmpowerment\n\nFirst-Order Strategies and Interven-\ntions\u2014Basic Awareness Raising\n\nBasic Impact\n\nTraditional religious, cultural, and \nsocial norms\n\n\u2022\n\nUsing print and broadcast media\n\n\u2022\n\n\u0007Tapping television and radio outreach\n\n\u0007Lack of knowledge among citizens \nand public officials\n\n\u2022\n\nPopular culture\n\nIncreased general awareness of rights \nand legal protection\n\nIncreased knowledge of specific legal \nrights and issues\n\n\u2022\n\nLack of economic independence\n\n\u2022\n\nInternet and other electronic media\n\nIntermediate-Level Constraints\n\nIntermediate-Level Impact\n\nSecond-Order Strategies and Interven-\ntions\u2014Resolving Individual Problems \nthrough Formal and Informal Justice \nSystems\n\n\u2022\n\nComplex power relationships\n\n\u2022\n\nCommunity-based training \n\nQuality of formal legal and institu-\ntional decision making and/or legal \nservices\n\n\u2022\n\nCommunity counseling\n\n\u2022\n\nParalegal services\n\n\u2022\n\nEnhancement of practical legal skills\n\n\u2022\n\nImproved access to the formal and \ninformal legal system and public \ndecision-making processes\n\nQuality of informal justice alterna-\ntives\n\n\u2022\n\nAlternative dispute resolution\n\n\u2022\n\n\u0007Poorly drafted laws and regulations\n\n\u2022\n\nLegal aid\n\n\u0007Inconsistency between formal law \nand traditional values\n\n\u0007Failure to implement sound laws and \nregulations or to follow prescribed \nprocedural standards\n\nHighest-Order Constraints\n\nHighest-Order Strategies and Interven-\ntions\n\nHighest-Order Impact\n\nLegal and administrative constraints \naffecting sector development pro-\ngrams\n\n\u2022\n\nPublic interest litigation\n\n\u2022\n\nAdministrative advocacy\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nLegal reform advocacy and legislative \ndrafting\n\nPioneering public\u2013private partner-\nships\n\nIncreased confidence and higher \nexpectations\n\nSuccessful participation in legal imple-\nmentation and public decision making\n\n\u0007Participation in law, regulatory, and \nbudgetary reform\n\n\u2022\n\n\u0007Improvements in material circumstances\n\nGreater sensitivity, responsiveness, and \naccountability on the part of govern-\nment officials\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\f50\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nGreater Sensitivity, Responsiveness, and \nAccountability on the Part of Government Officials\nFrequently, the objective of legal empowerment is not \nsimply to raise the knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and \nother  capacities  of  citizens,  but  also  to  impart  similar \nknowledge  and  capacity  among  government  officials. \nIncreased capacity and improved performance of public \nofficials  affects  legal  implementation,  as  well  as  the \nmaterial  circumstances  of  disadvantaged  populations \nand the quality of their participation in governance. The \nmore responsive and accountable officials are, the greater \nthe likelihood that these other types of impact will be \nachieved. Training is a direct way of trying to sensitize of-\nficials to their duties, citizens\u2019 rights, and the importance \nof being more responsive to public interests. Other ap-\nproaches can have an even greater empowering effect on \nthe disadvantaged. For example, citizen-focused efforts \ncan have a significant impact on public officials when \nsuch efforts equip disadvantaged citizens or communities \nto lobby, cooperate with, or in other ways interact more \neffectively with government personnel.\n\nContexts in Which Legal \nEmpowerment Interventions  \nare Most Successful \n\nLegal Empowerment is Best Advanced \nthrough Integrated Strategies\n\nOne  of  the  key  lessons  learned  from  the  \u000400\u0004  ADB \nlegal empowerment study,\u00040 and borne out by practi-\ncal program experience since then, is the significance \nof integrated legal empowerment activities. Examples \ndrawn from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and other \ncountries suggest that legal empowerment activities are \nespecially effective when they are included as compo-\nnents of mainstream development initiatives in public \nhealth, resource management, local governance reform, \nand other areas. There is always scope and a need for \norganizations  that  focus  specifically  on  legal  service \ndelivery  and  provide  important  technical  support  to \norganizations that follow an integrated approach. But, \nit is the integration model that is more likely to secure \n\n\u00040  ADB. \u000400\u0004a.

Integrated  strategies \nconsistently show the best success in advancing legal \nempowerment because they are flexible in adopting \nvarious  activities  that  reinforce  each  other.  Notable \nsuccesses have been achieved through an integrated \napproach that pairs legal education and support ser-\nvices  with  mainstream  development  work  in  public \nhealth,  education,  natural  resource  management \nand  environmental  conservation,  local  governance, \nor other sectors. \n\nPractical Examples from Bangladesh and Nepal\nIn  the  early  \u0004990s,  The  Asia  Foundation  supported \nfour specialist health and family planning Bangladeshi \nNGOs to introduce a community legal service program \nassessing whether health and family planning interven-\ntions  were  complementary  with  legal  empowerment \ninterventions. A \u000499\u0004 study of the pilot project found \nthat community management efforts by family planning \nNGOs in Bangladesh were strengthened by integrating \nthem with legal service interventions and vice versa.\u0004\u0004 \nNGO staff received legal training that they gave to their \npartner populations. They also coordinated community \nmediation  sessions  and  other  law-oriented  services. \nThe  project  was  far  more  successful  than  those  that \nwere introduced as stand-alone activities by dedicated \n\n\u0004\u0004  The Indonesia Irrigation Sector Legal Empowerment Study \n(\u000400\u0004\u2013\u000400\u0004) is a good example. Its ensuing pilot program \ninterventions focused on national irrigation management \ninitiatives in the context of the Government of Indonesia\u2019s \npolicy commitment to decentralization. The study examined \nthe challenges faced by farmers, water user associations, and \nlocal government officials tasked with new administrative \nand resource management responsibilities for irrigation and \nrelated utilization of water resources. Pilot program activities \ndemonstrated the positive impact of legal empowerment for \nfarmers and local officials and guided plans for integrating \nlegal empowerment components in a new national irrigation \nmanagement project.

This was because communities \nwere already familiar with family planning NGOs and \ntherefore more readily accepted new concepts under \nan integrated project. The new legal service providers \nexperienced difficulties with introducing the sensitive \ntopic of women\u2019s legal rights\u2014the communities reacted \nsimilarly  to  how  they  reacted  a  decade  earlier  when \nNGOs first introduced notions of family planning and \nthe woman\u2019s right to exercise reproductive rights. Family \nplanning NGOs were able to draw on the goodwill they \nhad established through years of contact with commu-\nnity members to stimulate community acceptance of \nwomen\u2019s legal rights and the need for greater gender \nequality in traditional shalish proceedings. Ultimately, \nwomen  who  became  aware  of  their  rights  achieved \ngreater  leverage  in  asserting  their  autonomy  in  per-\nsonal reproductive health decisions. These findings are \nconsistent with those of two similar studies in Nepal. \nThese studies indicated that \u201cliteracy is a key element \nin fostering women\u2019s empowerment and is especially \npowerful when women are given the opportunity for \npost-basic literacy study combined with other critical \ninterventions.\u201d\u0004\u0004 \n\nKnowledge Alone is Insufficient\n\nAs is previously noted, the first step in legal empower-\nment initiatives is providing knowledge training. How-\never, for the reasons discussed above, basic knowledge \ntraining alone is insufficient to ensure that people have \nthe capacity to protect their legal rights. For women \nand disadvantaged groups harness the power of that \nknowledge and demand more from the public institu-\ntions, they must also be given strategies, practical skills, \nand/or support mechanisms for enforcing their rights. \n\nOrganization is Power\n\nLegal empowerment has a greater chance of success \nwhen  it  is  undertaken  by  like-minded  stakeholder \ngroups working in a collective and coordinated manner. \nWhile the disadvantaged may understand their rights \nvery precisely and count on basic support interventions \n\n\u0004\u0004  Thomas, Gwen, and Ava Shrestha. \u0004998.

Village membership groups co-\nordinating microcredit, health education, or livelihood \ndevelopment, and community water-user associations \ncoordinating local resource management measures can \nbe excellent vehicles for legal empowerment because \nthey already are adept at program delivery. Collective \naction  tends  to  carry  greater  weight  than  individual \nefforts. It also lends greater momentum to advocacy \nefforts lobbying for the removal of traditional power \nadvantages and the economic and political benefits that \nthis power ensures.\n\nCivil Society Plays an Important Role  \nin Legal Empowerment\n\nThe  examples  cited  in  previous  sections  underline \nthe  point  that  civil  society  organizations  possess  an \nideal combination of capacity, initiative, flexibility, and \ndogged  determination  to  assist  the  disadvantaged \nto learn about and exercise their rights. NGOs, com-\nmunity-based  organizations,  media  associations,  and \nuniversity-based research or clinical legal education have \na proven capacity to facilitate local community efforts \nthrough work at the grassroots and national-level advo-\ncacy initiatives or network facilitation. This reflects the \nfact that NGOs attract committed young lawyers and \ndevelopment professionals; understand the complexity \nof local culture, politics, and power relations and enjoy \nthe trust of community members. Accordingly, national \nNGOs can be excellent partners for ADB and other in-\nternational agencies in designing, implementing, and \nmonitoring legal empowerment activities.\n\nComplementary Role of Government\n\nAlthough  civil  society  organizations  have  tended  to \ndemonstrate greater initiative in the leadership of legal \nempowerment initiatives, public agencies and officials \nhave  an  equally  important  role  that  for  many  years \nfailed  to  receive  due  attention.  Legal  empowerment \nhas traditionally been thought of as belonging in the \ndomain  of  civil  society  organizations.  However,  this \noverlooks  the  capacity  and  commitment  of  reform-\n\n\f52\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nminded public officials that operate in a very challenging \nenvironment and will have a better chance of securing \nleverage if they work in cooperation with civil society \npartners. Government plays an important role in legal \nempowerment  initiatives.  Many  government  officials \nact as decision makers, and their decisions affect the \nrights  and  economic  status  of  marginalized  groups. \nTherefore,  it  is  fundamental  that  public  officials  are \ngiven appropriate skills training. \n\nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships in  \nLegal Empowerment \n\nWhen civil society organizations and government agen-\ncies  work  together,  they  have  a  greater  capacity  to \ndesign and implement legal empowerment initiatives. \nExamples of effective public\u2013private partnerships have in \nfact emerged across Asia and other parts of the world. \nAlthough there are challenges to be faced in drawing \ntogether  civil  society  organizations  and  government \nagencies  on  projects,  the  potential  benefits  are  too \ncompelling  to  ignore.  The  national  voter  registration \ninitiative in Bangladesh serves as an excellent example. \nThe initiative was launched by the Bangladesh Election \nCommission (BEC) in August \u0004007, with support from \nthe armed forces. While civil society organizations had \nbeen involved in voter and civic education activities for \nmany years, they had never worked in close cooperation \nwith the BEC or the armed forces. There were challenges \nat the outset as all stakeholders adjusted to this unprec-\nedented working relationship and learned more about \neach other\u2019s respective capacities. However, after a few \nweeks, all stakeholders acknowledged the value of the \ncooperative working relations. In examples drawn from \nthe sphere of access to justice interventions, civil society-\nled legal empowerment initiatives focus on overcoming \nthe inequitable power relations between disadvantaged \ncommunities and the legal and administrative agencies \nwhose decision-making authority affects the rights and \neconomic circumstances of marginalized communities. \nWhen  the  quality  of  public\u2013private  relationships  are \ncentral to a legal empowerment strategy of any kind, \napproaches  that  involve  good  faith  dialogue,  coop-\neration, and compromise between stakeholder groups \nhave  greater  potential  than  those  pressed  solely  by \ncivil society organizations without benefit of common \nunderstanding and negotiation. \n\nLegal Implementation is Crucial to the \nBroader Impact of Legal Empowerment\n\nWhile  legal  empowerment  holds  great  potential  to \nchange the relationship between disadvantaged com-\nmunities  and  the  law  and  legal  and  administrative \ndecision-making mechanisms, it by no means can re-\nsolve every issue that affects the status and security of \nwomen, the poor, and other marginalized groups. Legal \nempowerment plays an important role in ensuring that \nsound laws are implemented fairly and consistently. But, \nthe burden of legal implementation must ultimately be \nborne by a variety of legal reform and capacity build-\ning initiatives and stakeholder groups, and not by the \ncommunity of legal empowerment practitioners in civil \nsociety and champions in government alone. \n\nHow is Legal Empowerment \nRelevant to Sector Development \nInitiatives?\n\nThe abovementioned constraints faced by women and \nother disadvantaged groups also affect sector develop-\nment programs run by ADB, multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment  institutions,  and  partner  government \nagencies.  Therefore,  legal  empowerment  equips  the \ndisadvantaged with the knowledge and skills to improve \ntheir position, thereby heightening the effectiveness of \nactivities undertaken by the ADB and other international \norganizations.\n\nA Natural Extension of Proven Integrated \nApproaches\nIn the past, the typical response to the legal problems \nof women and other disadvantaged populations has \nbeen to provide legal aid. However, decades of expe-\nrience  suggest  that  legal  counseling  and  assistance \nbarely  make  a  dent  in  the  broader  needs  of  target \npopulations.  In  most  cases,  these  projects  miss  op-\nportunities to address the underlying legal, administra-\ntive, and governance constraints that prevent women \nand  other  disadvantaged  groups  from  enjoying  the \nbenefits of sector development initiatives in a variety \nof areas. \n\nIn addition, while conventional legal aid interven-\ntions clearly benefit individuals, they do not necessarily \n\n\fAppendix 1\n\n53\n\nmanifestly reduce widespread poverty and/or improve \ngovernance. This is because they only serve one benefi-\nciary at a time. The exceptions to this are class-action \nlawsuits and public interest litigation. In such matters, \nthe circumstances of an individual beneficiary are rep-\nresentative of the interests of a broader community \nof beneficiaries. However, although legal aid aims to \nprovide immediate legal assistance to individuals by \nensuring the principles of equality before the law and \ndue process, in its highest form legal empowerment \nis intended to equip entire communities to use legal \nand administrative processes and structures to access \nservices and opportunities. In this way, legal empow-\nerment  aims  to  facilitate  long-term  and  sustainable \nchange that benefits entire communities and directly \nbenefits women and disadvantaged groups.\n\nUnderstanding that Certain Sector Program \nConstraints Reflect Underlying Legal and \nGovernance Issues\nIn  some  instances  the  actors  involved  in  mainstream \ndevelopment initiatives may not fully appreciate the un-\nderlying legal dimensions of their projects. For example, \nbeneficiary  populations  may  not  be  aware  that  the \nadministrative framework of a development assistance \n\nproject creates rights for the citizens to participate in \nproject design and implementation or their entitlement \nto  the  resulting  benefits.  The  situation  is  especially \ndifficult for the poor, women, and other marginalized \npopulations whose legal rights are routinely subject to \nmanipulation and abuse.\n\nIs Legal Empowerment a \nUniversally Supported Public Good? \n\nLegal empowerment initiatives have exciting and wide-\nreaching potential. Despite this, they represent a new \nand  relatively  experimental  concept  in  project  loans. \nThey will not necessarily be automatically and widely \nembraced.  Some  of  the  harshest  critics  are  likely  to \ncome from certain groups with an interest in keeping \ndisadvantaged groups on the margins of society. These \nhostile groups have an interest in retaining the power \nadvantages that they currently hold over women, ethnic \nand religious minority communities, and other disad-\nvantaged groups. One of the most significant challenges \nfor legal empowerment initiatives will be to convince \nthose in positions of power and influence to surrender \nto a level-playing field.\n\n\fAppendix 2 \nSummary Country Situation Analysis \nReports\n\nBangladesh\n\nKey Issues\n\nProgram  \nEnvironment\n\nIssues Affecting \nthe Rights and \nInterests of \nWomen and  \nDisadvantaged \nGroups\n\nSummary: Bangladesh\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nSince  independence  in  \u000497\u0004,  Bangladesh  has  struggled  to  achieve  democracy,  public  freedom,  rule  of  law, \nequality, and justice.\n\nDeficiencies  in  food,  shelter,  health  care,  education,  employment,  judicial  services,  and  security  result  from \nweak governance. In particular, gender disparities are prevalent in income levels, infant mortality rates, and \nchild malnutrition.\n\nRelations between nongovernment organizations (NGOs), civil society actors, and the Government of Bangladesh \nhave been characterized by mistrust.\n\nAchieved steady economic growth throughout the \u0004990s, and has reduced infant mortality rates, increased \nprimary school enrollment, and narrowed the gender gap.a\n\nThe political environment in Bangladesh is characterized by corruption, nepotism, and a lack of transparency \nand accountability among public officials.\n\nPolitical parties are often linked with criminal activities, and the police are used extensively in furthering corrupt \npractices.\n\nAccess to basic services is determined on the basis of power relations within the social hierarchy, not entitle-\nment and need.\n\nWomen\u2019s independence, ability to exert rights, and mobility is constrained by a patriarchal social structure, \nnotions of womanhood and honor, and religious bans on female leadership. This effectively blocks women\u2019s \naccess to the political process.\n\nResources for health and education are allocated in favor of male children, resulting in discrimination against \ngirls.\n\nSocial and some Islamic religious customs reinforce patriarchal domination. Difficulties have arisen where some \nreligious leaders have opposed legal empowerment programming on the grounds that NGOs seek to convert \nrural populations away from Islam.\n\nMost laws are written in English and therefore cannot be understood by disadvantaged and uneducated in-\ndividuals. \n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n55\n\nKey Issues\n\nSummary: Bangladesh\n\nThe  laws  tend  to  institutionalize  male  dominance,  especially  in  the  areas  of  marriage,  divorce,  inheritance, \nguardianship, and immigration. For example, there are no specific laws prohibiting domestic violence, leaving \nwomen vulnerable to aggression.\n\nThe legal system is characterized by complex processes, high court costs, delays, bias, corruption, and defective \nlaws. There is also scant available information to explain legal processes to the poor and uneducated. \n\nThe general nonresponsiveness of public institutions to common people\u2019s needs has contributed to a loss of \nfaith in the system. People perceive all levels of government as being inequitable, repressive, overly political, \nand biased.\n\nThe NGO community lacks the necessary skills, capacity, and funding to operate legal empowerment programs \nefficiently and accountably in the long run. In addition, many NGOs have only limited geographical reach, leav-\ning communities outside key locations without services. \n\nLegal  \nEmpowerment  \nActivities\n\n\u2022\n\nAwareness raising\n\n\u2022\n\nCommunity legal services\n\n\u2022\n\nAdvocacy and legal reform\n\n\u2022\n\nParticipatory legal or regulatory drafting\n\n\u2022\n\nUse of information and communications technology \n\nKey Actors in  \nLegal  \nEmpowerment  \nActivities\n\nCombination of high-level interventions\n\nLegal and development NGOs\n\n\u2022\n\nCommunity-based organizations\n\n\u2022\n\nPrint and electronic media\n\n\u2022\n\nNational and local government agencies\n\n\u2022\n\nLegal professionals \n\nMembers of the academic community\n\nGood Practice \nHighlights\n\nNijera Kori is an organization that is working toward empowering economically, politically, and socially disen-\nfranchised groups. It employs a strategy of collective strength and social mobilization among disadvantaged \ncommunities. In one case, to combat a local school district from charging unauthorized fees and thus making \neducation prohibitively expensive for the poor, Nijera Kori helped organize a mass gathering in a local market \nto educate the public on the unauthorized fees and apply pressure to local officials. \n\nBangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) is one of the country\u2019s largest legal aid organizations. It acted on \nbehalf of the Jalodas community, a highly marginalized Hindu group that survives on coastal fishing, by gaining \na stay of eviction after the local government sought to move the group for road construction. The Bangladesh \nLegal Aid and Services Trust also operates programs designed to alter the power relations in decision-making \nprocesses that often work against the disadvantaged. \n\nThe Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee is a large development organization providing credit.

The Supreme Court agreed that the document was discriminatory and mandated that female and male \nrepresentatives be treated equally.\n\nNGOs initially considered that the most important first step was to ensure that women and disadvantaged \ngroups have a basic understand of legal concepts. \n\nNGOs now understand that disseminating information is insufficient to achieve ongoing social transformation. \nNGOs have realized that disadvantaged groups need broader development of their capacities so that they can \nassert their rights in meaningful ways. NGOs have began developing integrated strategies combining legal aid \nservices with other efforts, such as social mobilization and the development of livelihood opportunities.\n\nThe current general perception about legal empowerment appears to be rooted in conventional law-oriented \nactivities. However, it is acknowledged that legal empowerment is more about power and freedom than it is \nabout law. As such, some services go further and build communities\u2019 capacities to use those laws and processes \nthemselves.\n\nMonitoring techniques remain fairly simple and are not capable of capturing and measuring the long-term \nimpact of empowerment programming. \n\nNGOs and the Government of Bangladesh tend to use conventional quantified assessments of initiatives, such \nas counting the number of (i) training sessions, workshops, and meetings organized; (ii) disputes mediated on \nspecific issues; and (iii) cases handled. Organizations providing legal aid services also conduct periodic follow-up \nactivities for a specific term during their project cycle. \n\nThere are secondary changes that occur as a result of legal empowerment activities that need to be measured. \nFor example, indications of shifting power relations and resource allocation may be demonstrated in practices \nregarding payment of dower and maintenance, reductions in arbitrary divorce and wife abuse, increased collec-\ntive bargaining for fair wages, and increased membership of disadvantaged groups in local government bodies. \nThe monitoring and assessment practices in Bangladesh can thus be strengthened by adding such metrics to \nlegal empowerment program evaluations. \n\n\u2022\n\nThere is a poor history of communication between the various organizations implementing legal empowerment \nactivities. As such, they miss the opportunity to learn new techniques or share lessons with each other.\n\nSummary: Indonesia\n\nSince \u0004998, Indonesia has been undergoing a process of decentralization, meaning that local authorities have \nmore control over affairs within their territorial jurisdiction. Although communities now have more opportunities \nto exert greater control over their lives, it also increases the power of local elites. \n\nThe Government of Indonesia has ratified the major international conventions that uphold the principles of \ngender equality and the empowerment of women. These include the: (i) United Nations Convention on the Politi-\ncal Rights of Women,b (ii) United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen (CEDAW),c (iii) Optional Protocol to CEDAW,d and (iv) International Labour Organization Convention \non Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value.e \n\n\fKey Issues\n\nSummary: Indonesia\n\nAppendix 2\n\n57\n\nThe Government of Indonesia has also indicated its intention to effect social change that is consistent with  \n(i) the \u0004994 Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development, (ii) \u000499\u0004 Cairo International Conference on Popula-\ntion and Development, (iii) \u000499\u0004 Beijing Platform for Action, (iv) \u0004000 United Nations Millennium Declaration, \nand (v) Millennium Development Goals.f\n\nThe Government of Indonesia has also adopted a set of policies and introduced a series of national develop-\nment programs aimed at advancing the social  and economic empowerment of  women and disadvantaged \ngroups, including \n\n(i) \n\nthe \u0004\u0004-Year Development Plan (\u0004994\u2013\u00040\u00049); \n\n(ii)  Repelita or Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun (Sixth Five-Year Development Plan [\u0004994\u2013\u0004999]), which \nintroduces  four  major  cross-sector  development  challenges:  (a)  enhancement  of  the  quality  of  human \nresources, (b) equality and poverty alleviation, (c) urban and rural environmental planning, and (d) land \nuse; and\n\n(iii)  Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah (Medium-Term Development Plan [\u0004004\u2013\u0004009]) which outlines \nthe Government of Indonesia\u2019s \u0004-year strategic development policy framework and identifies key policy \npriorities and charts strategic directions under three key areas: (a) the creation of an Indonesia that is safe \nand peaceful, (b) the establishment of an Indonesia that is just and democratic, and (c) the enhancement \nof the people\u2019s welfare; and \n\n(iv)  \u000400\u0004 Development Work Plan, which breaks down the Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah into \n\nannual work plans.\n\nEven though the Government of Indonesia is committed to reducing poverty and gender inequality, close to \n49% of Indonesians lived on less than $\u0004 per day in \u000400\u0004.g \n\nThe Indonesian legal system is a complex fusion of three distinct systems of civil, adat (customary), and religious \nlaws. The legislation and legal procedures are drafted in complicated legal language, making them unintelligible \nto nonlawyers. There are also many cases that demonstrate that the state often uses law as a tool to ensure the \nlegality of government authority rather than as means of protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens.\n\nMore cooperation is needed between civil society and government agencies. While collaborative efforts between \ngovernment reformers and civil society actors are gradually increasing, as evidenced by the successful passage of \nLaw No. \u0004\u0004/\u0004004 on the Elimination of Domestic Violence (enacted in September \u0004004), civil society organizations \nstill undertake the majority of legal empowerment initiatives. There remains a strong need for the Government \nof Indonesia and NGOs to coordinate and broaden their cooperation on legal empowerment initiatives.\n\nIssues Affecting \nthe Rights and \nInterests of \nWomen and \nDisadvantaged \nGroups\n\nWomen\u2019s rights remain largely unequal to men, especially in rural areas, where women\u2019s roles and contribu-\ntions  in  public  life  are  neither  acknowledged  nor  appreciated.  Indonesia\u2019s  existing  social  organization  and \nreligious  customs  identify  women\u2019s  key  roles  as  reproduction;  household  management;  and  ensuring  the \nphysical, social, and emotional well-being of family members. These gender-based stereotypes rob women of \nthe ambition and motivation to pursue their basic rights; enter into male-dominated areas of public life; or \nestablish financial autonomy by owning land and dwellings, accessing finance, or pursuing other avenues of \neconomic independence.\n\nGovernment agencies are not proactive in promoting women\u2019s participation in decision making or sensitivity \nabout gender equality, particularly among national and local-level legislators and policy makers. Consequently, \nthe needs of women and disadvantaged groups are frequently overlooked when governments budget for edu-\ncation, health, transport, water and sanitation, housing, and employment. While democratization has effected \npositive changes\u2014including the requirement that political parties are comprised of \u00040% women\u2014the level of \npolitical representation has yet to be realized in a consistent manner. \n\nPoor education hinders women and disadvantaged groups from winning jobs in the formal sector. Women find \nit increasingly difficult to win jobs in the formal labor market, especially those from rural areas who have only \ncompleted primary education. Women\u2019s ability to gain higher-paid jobs is hindered by gender stereotyping that \nsuggests that women should stick to traditional women\u2019s work. Such work tends to be lower paid and is lower\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\f58\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nKey Issues\n\nSummary: Indonesia\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\ndown the chain of responsibility, meaning that women find it difficult to advance to positions of higher respon-\nsibility that earn more money.h \n\nIndonesia\u2019s law lags behind in protecting women\u2019s rights. In particular, laws about marriage and divorce, prop-\nerty, inheritance, finance, general and reproductive health, labor and social protection, violence against women, \nmigration, and human trafficking do not ensure women\u2019s rights are equal with men\u2019s rights. \n\nThe overlapping legal systems also erode women\u2019s rights. Under decentralized government, there is scope for \nlocal governments to advance public policies based on religious law, which might erode women\u2019s rights. The \nchallenge for women will be to press for a gender-sensitive interpretation of religious law.i \n\nViolence against women is prevalent in Indonesia. Data collected by the National Commission on the Elimina-\ntion of Violence against Women indicate that in \u0004004 there were almost double the number of reported cases \nthan there were in \u000400\u0004. In \u000400\u0004, there were \u00040,\u00049\u0004 cases reported, which represented a \u00049% increase from \n\u0004004. Also, 80% of cases of violence result from domestic violence, and \u0004\u0004% of women in Indonesia experience \nviolence in the course of their lives.j\n\nCorruption, cronyism, and poor governance are widespread in Indonesia, and have a particularly devastating \nimpact on women and other disadvantaged groups. Corruption has led to cases of illegal charging of rent; \naccepting bribes in relation to local land use decisions; and profiteering in relation to development projects, \nwhich leads to local populations being ignored or oppressed. \n\nDecentralization  of  government  power  has  not  increased  women\u2019s  participation  in  governance.  A  number \nof challenges affect the quality of women\u2019s access and participation in local governance, including a lack of \nadequate women\u2019s representation in formal consultations convened by local legislatures, a revival of conserva-\ntive religious interpretations of gender roles, and a revival of gender insensitive or discriminatory religious or \ntraditional laws. \n\nBasic awareness-raising or legal literacy activities using: (i) print media (newspapers, posters, and pamphlets); \n(ii) electronic media (radio and television); and (iii) popular cultural performances such as music, street theater, \nand mobile cinemas.\n\nProviding legal services to individual clients to help them with formal legal claims and informal dispute resolu-\ntion procedures.\n\nPursuing national legal reform by engaging in advocacy on government policy, including petitioning for the \ncreation of a legal services ombudsman, participating in legal or regulatory drafting at the national and local \nlevels, engaging in public interest litigation, undertaking media and advocacy campaigns, and lobbying law \nschools to run courses on clinical legal education and women and the law.\n\n\u2022\n\nHelping establish active support services such as community counseling, shelters, community-based legal train-\ning, legal aid, and alternative dispute resolution (ADR). \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Activities\n\nIn \u000400\u0004\u2013\u000400\u0004, The Asia Foundation undertook the Indonesia Irrigation Sector Legal Empowerment Study with \nfinancial support from the Government of the Netherlands. The study aimed to develop a strategy and imple-\nmentation plan for a legal empowerment project to be included as a component of the planned Participatory \nIrrigation Sector Project. The study concluded that a legal empowerment component should operate at the \ncommunity, district, provincial, and central levels, and should place special emphasis on community needs. The \nstudy also found that legal empowerment work in the irrigation sector should respond to the specific needs \nand interests of local partners.\n\nLegal \nEmpowerment \nActivities\n\nGeneral Activities\n\n\fKey Issues\n\nSummary: Indonesia\n\nAppendix 2\n\n59\n\nKey Actors\n\n\u2022\n\nGood Practice \nHighlights\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe study conducted four pilot legal empowerment projects. The pilot projects aimed to examine the types of \nissues and activities that civil society organizations face when assisting water user associations and their local \ncommunities, particularly when interacting with local officials and participating in legal and other public deci-\nsion-making processes. The following common elements were reflected in each pilot project: (i) a grassroots \napproach,(ii) core focus on irrigation needs and priorities, (iii) attention to other community needs and priorities, \n(iv) attention to gender concerns, and (v) addressing common community concerns. Most beneficiaries in the \npilot-project sites reported that the legal empowerment methodologies and approaches had strengthened the \ncapacity of water user associations and their communities.\n\nThe Association for Community and Ecologically-Based Law Reform promotes human rights, justice, cultural \npluralism, and sustainable resource management. It advocates for policy reform and collaborates with partner \ninstitutions, academics, grassroots-level community organizations, and other stakeholders. It builds and main-\ntains support networks at the community level, trains NGOs and activists, holds legal consultation sessions, \nfacilitates legal drafting, and documents local and regional regulations affecting natural resource management \nand conservation.\n\nIndonesian Women\u2019s Association for Justice (APIK) has \u0004\u0004 chapters in \u0004\u0004 cities throughout Indonesia. Its focuses \non gender justice and women\u2019s access to the legal system. APIK\u2019s main activities consist of providing legal ser-\nvices to women victims of domestic and public violence; legal counseling for domestic and public workers and \nsexually exploited girls; and empowering women to access justice by running training sessions, running public \noutreach sessions, and participating in policy and legal reform.\n\nConvention Watch Working Group undertakes research to support the formulation of policies and legislation, \nparticularly those directly affecting the lives of women. It also aims to empower law enforcement officials such \nas police, prosecutors, judges, and lawyers. It also conducts workshops at various public and private universi-\nties to encourage them to make their curricula sensitive to gender issues. Convention Watch also monitors the \nimplementation of the CEDAW. It has initiated programs aimed at increasing understanding and awareness of \nthe need and the obligation of the Government of Indonesia to fully implement the CEDAW. Working closely \nwith law schools, Convention Watch has conducted training workshops and lectures on gender and law for \nlegal professionals, as well as training programs for communities on the drafting of local regulations concerning \nwomen and children, migrant workers, and human trafficking. \n\nThe Center for Indonesian Law and Policy Studies publishes reports on legislative processes and conducts work-\nshops for political parties. It is currently preparing a blueprint for the establishment of the Human Rights Court \nand a manual on anticorruption initiatives in court administration.\n\nThe Indonesian Institute for Independent Judiciary focuses on supreme court reform. It designs proposals for \nreforming the structure of the Supreme Court (including its system of information), monitors and analyzes ver-\ndicts, monitors the recruitment and election of judges and other legal officials, scrutinizes the performance of \njudicial officers and administrators, assesses the integrity of nominees for appointment to the Supreme Court, and \ninvestigates the wealth of incumbent judicial officers and those nominated for appointment to the bench.\n\nHukum Online is an online clearing house publishing in Bahasa information on legal reform, legislation, court \ndecisions, and legal reform issues.\n\nThe World Bank Justice for the Poor Program aims to help poor communities by improving their knowledge of \nthe law and enabling them to access ADR procedures. The program integrates research and operational activi-\nties, and encourages successful partnerships and knowledge sharing. It aims to contribute to the Government \nof Indonesia\u2019s first National Strategy on Access to Justice, which will be included in \u00040\u00040\u2013\u00040\u00044 Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan. Program activities also contribute to a national program to build the capacity of community \nservice organizations to help people access justice by providing legal aid and paralegal programs at the grassroots \nlevel\u2014this is known as \u201cparalegalism\u201d in Indonesia. \n\nThe Asia Foundation and other organizations have developed programs to support women to assume leadership \nroles in public affairs and enhance the skills of women involved in political affairs, including elected parliamen-\ntarians. The programs have trained women parliamentarians about the legislative process; helped develop skills \nof  local  women  leaders  from  various  political  parties;  and  stressed  the  importance  of  women\u2019s  substantive \nparticipation in politics, parliaments, and political parties.\n\n\f60\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nKey Issues\n\nSummary: Indonesia\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe Center for Electoral Reform, North Sumatra Women\u2019s Movement, Reform in Surakarta, and Anging Mamiri \nran training programs for \u000440 out of a total of \u0004\u0004\u0004 provincial-level female politicians. This program provided the \nfirst-ever training session for female members of parliaments providing training on basic skills in legal drafting \nand understanding gender issues in the local context. It also helped establish key networks of women politi-\ncians, NGOs, academics, and the media. \n\nLimpapeh (a West Sumatra-based organization) worked through a traditional institution called Bundo Kanduang, \nan organization of respected community women, to increase women\u2019s participation in local policy making. \nLimpapeh\u2019s work helped to increase women\u2019s participation in local policy making and strengthen the capacity \nof Bundo Kanduang members to participate in local governance at the village level.\n\nFollowing sustained advocacy efforts by women\u2019s organizations and the establishment of the National Com-\nmission on Violence against Women, violence against women has been acknowledged as a public issue and a \nviolation of human rights. The commission and several local women\u2019s organization have publicly reported to \nthe international community the problem of violence against women in Indonesia. \n\nThe Women\u2019s Crisis Centre Bengkulu drafted a set of operating procedures for use by NGOs, hospitals, psy-\nchologists, crisis centers, the police, attorneys, social agencies and the Women\u2019s Empowerment Bureau when \ndealing with female victims of violence. \n\nThe Women\u2019s Network For National Legislation Program has supported civil society advocacy and policy dia-\nlogues on the anti-trafficking bill and provided technical assistance for parliamentary discussions of the anti-\ntrafficking bill. \n\nNGOs, academics, the media, reform-minded local authorities, and donor agencies have played a key role in \nadvocating for the adoption of laws that require local governments and mining and forestry companies to \nobtain the free and prior informed consent of communities before harvesting natural resources. These reform \nefforts followed the \u0004999 Regional Autonomy Act, under which regional legislatures are free to enact their \nown provisions.\n\nAPIK Jakarta has conducted legal empowerment initiatives at the national and grassroots levels. Women who \nhave received legal assistance from APIK have formed taskforces through which they provide legal services to \nother members of their communities. \n\nIn \u0004000, Convention Watch Working Group supported a group of \u00044 flight attendants who filed a complaint \nagainst Garuda Indonesia Airlines regarding its requirement that women retire \u00040 years earlier than their male \ncounterparts. Convention Watch launched a media campaign highlighting the flight attendants\u2019 rights as women \nunder international law and their treatment as employees of Garuda. After \u0004 years of dispute with Garuda\u2019s \nBoard of Directors, the women brought the issue to the attention of the Minister of Women Empowerment, \nthe Minister of Manpower, the Minister of National Enterprises, and the National Parliament. The complaint \nwas settled in July \u000400\u0004, with the women being reinstated.\n\nADB has found that most civil society groups in Indonesia adhere to legal empowerment strategies in spirit, if \nnot in strict terms.\n\nFor example, Huma (a Jakarta-based organization) defines legal empowerment differently to ADB. It considers \nlegal empowerment is making the society understand adat law, and the best ways to use their local and cus-\ntomary laws in their daily lives. Huma regards its beneficiaries as partners and not as passive recipients of legal \nassistance. It strives to build the capacity of communities so that they do not depend on outside organizations \nin resolving their legal issues. \n\nAPIK defines legal empowerment as a process involving promoting and providing practical avenues through \nwhich women, and to a lesser extent other vulnerable groups, can operate effectively to achieve social gains. \nAPIK believes that its efforts are not geared toward promoting justice to women only, but rather to all members \nof the society.\n\nUnderstanding \nof Legal \nEmpowerment \nand Whether \nthat \nUnderstanding \nCorrelates to \nthe Study\u2019s \nDefinition \nof Legal \nEmpowerment\n\n\fKey Issues\n\nMonitoring, \nAssessment, \nand \nEvaluation\n\nPakistan\n\nKey Issues\n\nProgram  \nEnvironment\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nAppendix 2\n\n61\n\nSummary: Indonesia\n\nMonitoring and evaluation methods and assessment of legal empowerment activities are for the most part \nconventional.  Most  of  the  activities  are  rooted  in  the  quantified  assessment  of  initiatives  carried  out  under \ngiven projects. \n\nAmong smaller, community-based implementing organizations, monitoring and evaluation tools tend to be basic \nand primarily involve the quantification of basic services and outputs. Smaller and less sophisticated organizations \nfrequently lack the necessary training and resources to follow up on activities and outcomes in a systematic way. \nWhile the basic monitoring and evaluation systems and procedures followed by smaller providers are adequate \nfor generating quantitative reports on the number and nature of disputes that they handle, they typically lack \ndeeper bases of inquiry and analysis. Moreover, the basic systems and procedures followed offer little scope for \nfollow-up to ascertain whether agreements are honored.\n\nLarger and better established organizations tend to have the greatest capacity to design and implement sophisti-\ncated monitoring and evaluation systems. Several legal empowerment organizations have begun to place greater \nemphasis on the quality and sophistication of their monitoring and evaluation tools. Some organizations have \ninvested in empirical baseline studies that serve as a basis for monitoring impact over time and/or help them \nidentify and refine program activities that target the needs and interests of beneficiary populations. \n\nMore sophisticated monitoring and evaluation measurements are needed to assess whether there have been \nadvances in the (i) collective strength and solidarity among members of beneficiary communities, (ii) confidence \nand self-esteem levels of women beneficiaries or minority populations, (iii) role and treatment of women in \ncommunity justice and decision making.\n\nThere is a greater need for better monitoring and evaluation measurements because the Government of Indo-\nnesia, civil society organizations, and donor agencies are now focusing more on implementing the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, national poverty reduction strategy, and pro-poor growth concepts. All parties need moni-\ntoring and evaluation systems that enable efficient information sharing, minimize their administrative burdens, \nand standardize key output and impact measures across projects and parties. The methodologies need to move \ntoward more sophisticated bases of inquiry that explore the relationship between legal empowerment, improved \ngovernance, and poverty reduction. \n\nImplementing organizations are investing greater time, energy, and resources in developing better monitoring \nand evaluation methodologies. However, busy schedules and competing demands on their time provide few \nopportunities for them to share experiences and learn from one another, while donors in turn have few op-\nportunities to coordinate and share experiences and lessons learned.\n\nSummary: Pakistan\n\nPakistan\u2019s political and economic power is highly centralized and held tightly by the feudal, industrial, bureau-\ncratic, and military elite. These groups fight among each other to protect their own interests, meaning that the \npolitical process progresses unevenly. The resulting uncertainty has impeded the growth of democratic norms \nand the rule of law. \n\nAbout \u0004\u0004% of the population lives below the poverty line, while almost \u00040% of the population lacks access to \nbasic needs and services such as clean water and health care. The education system is undeveloped. Women, \nminorities, the rural and urban poor, and other disadvantaged groups all lack social and economic safety nets \nand face severe social exclusion.k\n\nThe Government of Pakistan has prepared numerous policy documents promoting the rights of women and \ndisadvantaged citizens, including (i) the Medium-Term Development Framework \u000400\u0004\u2013\u00040\u00040, (ii) \u000400\u0004 Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper, (iii) \u000400\u0004 National Policy On Women, and (iv) \u0004997 National Plan of Action for Women. \nPakistan is also a party to treaties such as (i) CEDAW, (ii) United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, \nand (iii) International Labour Organization Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent \nCountries. Pakistan is obligated under these treaties to take measures necessary to ensure the protection and \npromotion of its citizens\u2019 rights. \n\n\f62\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nKey Issues\n\nSummary: Pakistan\n\nIssues \nAffecting the \nRights and \nInterests of \nWomen and \nDisadvantaged \nGroups\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nPakistan is an amalgamation of various linguistic, ethnic, and cultural groups. Factors such as wealth, class, \nreligion, caste, tribe, and clan affect people\u2019s access to services and rights, and exclude large sections of the \npopulation from political and economic power. Women, minorities, and the urban and rural poor are particu-\nlarly disadvantaged. Generally, minority populations belong to the poorest sections of society and are further \ndisadvantaged  by  social  biases,  outdated  laws,  and\u2014for  almost  two  decades\u2014an  apartheid-like  separate \nelectorate system. \n\nWhile  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  improved  legal  rights,  women  remain  disempowered  across  all  classes.l  \nPakistan  is  characterized  by  a  rigid  social  system  combined  with  entrenched  patriarchal  norms  that  violate \nwomen\u2019s basic human rights and deny them the right to an independent existence. About \u0004\u0004% of the female \nlabor force works in the informal sector and is consequently cut off from the minimal protection provided by \nlabor law. Affirmative action, however, has bolstered women\u2019s political representation, causing an increased \nfemale presence in all legislative assemblies.m \n\nA weak judicial system is unable to provide effective access to justice to large sections of the population. More-\nover, traditional customs and practices commonly override statutory law and Islamic injunctions alike. \n\nThe cost of living has risen sharply, and the Pakistan rupee has devalued significantly. Such factors have further \nmarginalized disadvantaged groups, causing them to lose faith in the system. These factors have also contributed \nto growing intolerance, increased crime, sectarian and ethnic conflict, and the emergence and strengthening \nof militant religious groups and parties.\n\nDaily life and the political area are dominated by corruption, nepotism, and oligarchy. Consequently, government \ninstitutions have been largely ineffective and unresponsive to the needs of a diverse population. \n\nPeople have a poor understanding of their legal rights, and the judicial system does not actively protect the \nrights of the poor, weak, women, or marginalized. \n\nMany of the country\u2019s laws still discriminate against women and minorities. Many of these laws were enacted \nbetween \u0004977 and \u0004988. There are also serious gaps in labor laws, meaning that a large portion of workers \nhave no enforceable rights. Entrenched authoritarian  patriarchal norms and structures prevent women and \nmarginalized communities from accessing legal rights, services, and resources. \n\nPeople do not understand how to take action to protect their legal rights and have little faith in the system. \nAdditionally, there are very few avenues for formally protecting legal rights in rural areas, contributing to the \nongoing stronghold of informal dispute resolution forums. \n\nThe legal system is in need of urgent overhaul. Legal proceedings are plagued with (i) delay; (ii) a low ratio of \njudges to the population; (iii) a high number of frivolous claims; (iv) overcrowded, chaotic, and poorly maintained \njudicial facilities; (v) high costs; (vi) incompetent legal representation; and (vii) instances of maladministration \nin the courts. \n\nServices and resources are not distributed equally between Pakistan\u2019s four provinces. About \u00040% of Pakistan\u2019s \npopulation lives in Punjab, which is the most urbanized of the provinces and has the best range of services. \nOutside of Punjab, service delivery and infrastructure is poor. There are frequent armed skirmishes in many rural \nareas. Local elites govern according to traditional norms that tend to suppress people\u2019s legal rights and main-\ntain unequal social structures. These structures maintain the status quo of inequitable ranks and the continued \nexclusion of vulnerable groups. The weaker elements of society thus have limited opportunity or space to effect \nchange and generally remain powerless. Weak state structures and the unwillingness of successive governments \nto change the status quo have created an environment of decay, exemplified by poor service delivery, nonre-\nsponsiveness, and the virtual nonperformance of different government institutions. \n\n\u2022\n\nMen and those from majority or dominant tribes and higher castes have the best access to rights. Also, male \nheads of household, young men, male children, and older men and women commonly have more rights and \nentitlements at the household and community level than young women and female children. People from minority \nor less powerful ethnic groups and women are often deprived of even their most basic rights.\n\n\fKey Issues\n\nLegal  \nEmpowerment  \nActivities\n\nKey Actors\n\n\u2022\n\nRozan is a civil society group working on issues of violence against women and sexual abuse.\n\nAppendix 2\n\n63\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nSummary: Pakistan\n\nSeveral  groups  in  Pakistan  provide  specific  skills  training  on  mediation,  the  transfer  of  knowledge,  account \nkeeping, and report writing. \n\nMany groups produce a range of publications, such as newsletters and posters, that address a variety of sub-\njects. Groups are increasingly using theater productions to raise awareness on issues. The groups then provide \ninformation on resource groups that can assist with the different issues. \n\nThere is a trend toward running legal empowerment initiatives at the grassroots level. Several initiatives seek \nto create new public spaces by linking the political and civic arenas. An example of this trend is the use of local \ncitizens\u2019 action committees and peoples\u2019 assemblies as alternative forums for discussing issues, raising aware-\nness, and devising collective strategies to bring together political actors and citizens. \n\nMany organizations are doing excellent work to provide people with information on how to access government \ninstitutions and programs. However, more work is needed to improve people\u2019s ability to access government \nservices and resources independently. Therefore, much of the current work cannot really be characterized as \nlegal empowerment activity. \n\nMany government agencies also fail to qualify as legal empowerment initiatives. More programs are needed to \nprovide disadvantaged groups with support mechanisms (including legal assistance), enhance political repre-\nsentation, and improve governance and access to justice. \n\nThe Interactive Resource Centre builds advocacy skills and consciousness about rights among marginalized sec-\ntions of society through the use of interactive theater. Apart from its own performances, it catalyses community \ngroups through rigorous training and backup. \n\nThe Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research was established in \u000498\u0004 by individuals from trade unions, \nacademia, and other professions to alleviate the powerlessness faced by workers. It conducts educational and \ntraining courses for workers from all over the country, including special programs for women workers. It also \nadvocates for workers\u2019 rights, holds seminars, facilitates dialogue, and promotes an understanding of rights \nand laws within the wider national and international context. Factory workers are also taught practical skills to \naid them in asserting and protecting their rights. \n\nThe Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation addresses the issues of women\u2019s lower status at the \nlegal, political, economic, and social levels. Its programs seek to overcome women\u2019s minimal participation in \ndecision-making processes and their lack of access to knowledge, resources, and institutions while simultane-\nously addressing the air of insensitivity regarding women\u2019s issues.\n\nThe Shirkat Gah\u2014Women\u2019s Resource Centre works to increase women\u2019s autonomy, promote gender equality, \nand actively cultivate democratic norms.\n\nThe Pirbhat Women Development Society seeks to address negative attitudes and practices toward women, \nspecifically attending to women\u2019s lack of education. \n\nRozan runs the Rabta Police Training Project in conjunction with the National Police Training Academy. The \nproject seeks to address the growing trend of police violence. Also, modifying police behavior can have a sig-\nnificant impact on police treatment of women\u2019s complaints of abuse and violence. The project provides training \non self-growth, interpersonal communication skills, stress and anger management, attitudes and behaviors, \nviolence against women and children, and human rights. So far, 70 workshops have trained \u0004,\u000400 police from \nall of Pakistan\u2019s provinces. Evaluations and assessments conducted over a period of time demonstrated that \nwithin \u0004 months after completing training, police reverted to previous behavior. To combat this, Rozan altered \nits training program. The \u00040 days of training are now spread over a period of months. In January and February \n\u000400\u0004, Rozan ran a train-the-trainers session for \u0004\u0004 trainers and instructors from police schools and colleges \nthroughout Pakistan. This was designed to institutionalize learning and integrate their module into the regular \npolice education curriculum. \n\nGood Practice \nHighlights\n\nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships\n\n\f64\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nKey Issues\n\nSummary: Pakistan\n\nTransformative Theatre \n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe Interactive Resource Centre uses interactive theater to build advocacy skills and consciousness about rights \namong marginalized sections of society. By creating specific scenarios that resonate with the audience, interactive \ntheater enables people to relate dramatized scenes with their own experiences. These plays proactively invite \nthe audience to analyze the issues (which are presented from different angles), identify underlying causes and \npower dynamics, and formulate alternative solutions. The center has started airing its plays on cable television. \nIn Sheikhupura, the center used television to address access to water issues faced by the local community. It \nsurveyed the problem, videotaped separate discussions with the community and the local administration, and \nproduced a \u00040-minute video segment. This video segment was then shown to both the community and the \nadministration, allowing each side to view the issue from both perspectives. This enabled a meaningful dialogue \nto occur and eventually led to better maintenance of the water supply. The center had the video segment aired \non cable television, followed by a panel discussion. \n\nPolitical Education \n\nThe Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation has created a number of programs that are achieving \ngood results. Its Legislative Watch Program monitors the legislative and policy-making process and undertakes \nadvocacy interventions for legal and policy reform. Its Political Education Program aims to increase the knowledge \nbase of catalyst groups and women within political parties. The program places emphasis on constitutional \nrights, the legal framework, economic development, and the impact of policies on women. \n\nIts Advocacy and Action Program works with citizen action committees to provide support structures for women\u2019s \nempowerment at the district level. As the Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation\u2019s programs are \nintegrated and linked across sectors, citizen action committee members are able to establish information network \ncenters as part of the Advocacy and Action Program. These centers now serve as gathering places for women \nto address common issues. The Advocacy and Action Program also supports groups to undertake advocacy \nand action on women\u2019s political and economic empowerment and violence against women. The program led \nto citizen action committees tackling a variety of issues. For example, the Kalat Citizen Action Committee in \nBalochistan vigorously resisted the tribal chiefs\u2019 decision to prohibit women from voting in the \u0004998 local elec-\ntion. Their campaign resulted in the chiefs reversing their decision, thereby enabling women voters to actively \nparticipate in the electoral process. \n\nStrengthening Workers\n\nThe Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research conducts educational and training courses for workers \nfrom all over the country. After unsuccessful attempts to jointly train men and women in \u0004999, it introduced \nspecial courses for women in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar. The modules for the women\u2019s courses have been \ntailored to address their particular needs and to motivate them to push for greater involvement in organizational \nactivities. Training participants include nurses, teachers, and members of other workers\u2019 associations, as well as \nsome workers from the informal sector. The program has trained nearly \u000400 women. \n\nThese training sessions have inspired a number of participants to form independent bodies, which attests to \nthe training program\u2019s success. Garment workers in Naushehro Feroze (Sindh) formed a body and organized \na week-long training course. In Quetta, Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research trainees formed \na society and organized a \u0004-day orientation with local resource persons. Training participants from Peshawar \nformed the Workers Education, Research, and Welfare Society. It has since organized several training seminars \nfor workers on national issues. It initially conducted the seminars with financial and technical support from the \nPakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research, and is now supported by the International Labour Organiza-\ntion. The society also ran a special \u0004-week workshop for \u0004\u0004 women workers dealing with the status of women \nand their problems, discriminatory laws, labor laws, and the women\u2019s movement.\n\nPromoting Legal Consciousness \n\nThe Shirkat Gah\u2014Women\u2019s Resource Centre runs the Women, Law, and Status Program that focuses on building \nthe capacity of community-based organizations. The program conducts a series of \u0004- or \u0004-day legal awareness \nworkshops. The sessions review local customs and practices and examine how the practices can discriminate\nagainst women and how they differ from women\u2019s enshrined legal rights. Under the program, Shirkat Gah \nruns  a  4\u0004-day  intensive  paralegal  training  workshop.  It  also  works  with  community-based  organizations  to \nshow them how they can build their capacity and strengthen their processes. It also educates trainers on how \nto communicate ideas. While the program has a small legal aid component, the main purpose of the training \nsessions is to show people how to assert their rights. Shirkat Gah also encourages paralegals to resolve matters \nthrough mediation and community-level intervention geared at addressing specific problems. \n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n65\n\nKey Issues\n\nSummary: Pakistan\n\nGrassroots Empowerment \n\nUnderstanding \nof Legal \nEmpowerment \nand Whether \nthat \nUnderstanding \nCorrelates to \nthe Study\u2019s \nDefinition \nof Legal \nEmpowerment\n\nMonitoring, \nAssessment, \nand \nEvaluation\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nPirbhat Women Development Society regularly conducts workshops and seminars to sensitize the police and \nlegal practitioners about women\u2019s issues and concerns, and engages with the media to promote a better under-\nstanding of women\u2019s issues. Policy dialogues are held with members of both the Sindh Provincial Assembly and \nthe National Assembly. The sessions are well attended and highlight the society\u2019s political connectedness and \nstrong relationships with local governments and local communities. The group has started extending paralegal \ntraining locally and hopes to replicate Shirkat Gah\u2019s legal outreach program.\n\nCivil society groups have undertaken a significant number of initiatives to increase \u201cthe ability of women and \ndisadvantaged groups to use legal and administrative processes to access resources, services, and opportunities.\u201d \nSome have a single focus such as a specific group of people or sector, while others are broader. \n\nMany legal empowerment initiatives are networked both in general coalitions and on issue-specific alliances, \nsuch  as  water,  dams,  forests,  women,  or  reproductive  health.  This  strategy  helps  to  collectively  undertake \nadvocacy, including public interest litigation, for which the coalitions and alliances can pool resources persons \nand materials.\n\nMonitoring, assessment, and evaluation remain poorly developed in Pakistan. Reporting is still largely seen as a \nrequirement for funding rather than a learning process, and only some legal empowerment initiatives establish \nbaseline  surveys  and  systematic  documentation.  There  is  a  tendency  to  carry  out  results-based  assessments \nrather than process-oriented monitoring and evaluation. \n\nA number of legal empowerment groups periodically review their own strategies and impact, leading to course \ncorrections through new activities, priorities, or areas of engagement. Some groups also periodically carry out \nstrategic planning exercises. \n\nVirtually all of the legal empowerment initiatives monitor the legal and political environment for threats as well \nas opportunities\u2014which is indeed necessary to remain effective\u2014and for some, this is a major, if not principal, \nactivity. Nevertheless, most of these initiatives are not carried out in a structured and documented manner and \ntherefore are not easily replicated.\n\na  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). \u000400\u0004.

This section, which briefly describes \nthese challenges, will help situate and inform the next \nsection, which provides an overview of the findings. \n\nChallenge One\n\nThe time frame for this project was short. Even during \nthe planning phase, much discussion was devoted to \nthe fact that even under ideal conditions legal empow-\nerment is a long-term process. The project team and \nADB counterparts were particularly concerned that the \nrelatively short time frame for the pilot-project initiatives \n(less than a year in each case) would affect the results.\nThis short time frame made it difficult for the pilot \nprojects to achieve measurable differences in the four \nkey areas of impact associated with legal empower-\nment: (i) confidence, (ii) knowledge, (iii) strategies, and \n(iv) outcomes. Even at the inception phase, the team \nexpected that, in the space of only a few months, it \nmight be reasonable to see a small increase in confi-\ndence and, ideally, a small boost in local patterns of \nfamiliarity with specific legal provisions and specific ad-\nministrative rights (i.e., knowledge). At the same time, \nit was understood that measurable changes in the spe-\ncific nature of local dispute resolution strategies would \nbe  very  difficult  to  achieve.  Moreover,  measurable \nchanges in the nature of local outcomes\u2014particularly \nin terms of local access to economic resources\u2014would \nbe extremely unlikely.\n\nAs  the  following  section  on  findings  reveals, \nthese expectations were clearly articulated in the data, \ndrawing special attention to the relationship between  \n(i) time frame and (ii) results. Indeed, those in the plan-\nning phase of legal empowerment initiatives should be \nwell aware of this relationship and plan accordingly. \nIn the field of legal empowerment, change takes time. \nThis was not a surprising discovery, but it was arguably \none of the most important.\n\n\fChallenge Two\n\nThe project needed to measure the impact of specific le-\ngal empowerment interventions at the community level. \nIt needed to demonstrate that the project could benefit \nmore people than only those who directly participated \nin or were specifically targeted by the project interven-\ntions. Here, the challenge was quite straightforward: \nhow could a random sample within the community test \nthe impact of a short-term project that involved a very \nspecific group of pilot-project participants?\n\nThis was, in many ways, a challenge on two lev-\nels. First, it was a challenge related to the question of \ntime frame mentioned previously. It was understood \nthat, in a few short months, it would be very difficult \nto demonstrate that the benefits of the outreach and \ntraining initiatives actually succeeded in reaching be-\nyond a very specific circle of project participants. Over \nthe course of \u00048 months or \u00044 months, it would be \nreasonable to expect some degree of transferal from \nindividual participants to the community as a whole. \nIn the space of only a few months, it would be a sig-\nnificant achievement just to reach direct participants, \nraise their awareness, train them, refresh their train-\ning, and reinforce what they had learned. To expect a \nwider impact on the community as a whole\u2014one that \nmight be measurable with a random sample drawn \nfrom that community\u2014would be extremely ambitious. \nThe full effect of this challenge emerged in the data. \nAfter only a few months, it was found that focusing \non a random sample within the community generated \nlimited results.\n\nThe challenges associated with a random sample \nwere  also  related  to  the  fact  that  the  project  team \nengaged specific participants in each pilot project and \nthen attempted to test the impact of those projects \nwithin  the  community  as  a  whole.  Here,  again,  the \nproject team asked a very simple question: is it better to \nevaluate the impact of these (targeted) pilot initiatives \non the participants themselves or on the community \nas a whole? \n\nIf one evaluates the impact of the project on the \nparticipants  themselves,  there  is  some  risk  that  the \nM&E protocol will guide the pilot-project itself. In other \nwords, the pilot-project activities will simply \u201cteach to \nthe test.\u201d This approach carries a certain risk of bias. \nOn the other hand, if one evaluates the impact of the \nproject on the community as a whole (as the project \nteam did), there is a risk that the evaluation protocol \n\nAppendix 3\n\n67\n\nwill reveal a very limited impact, or even no impact, \nwhen, in fact, the impact for some members of the \ncommunity was actually quite significant.\n\nThere is no easy solution for this challenge. The \nbest response would be to allow as much time as pos-\nsible for the project to unfold, so that the increased \nconfidence and knowledge of individual participants \nmight spill over into the community as a whole. This \ntrickle-down effect might in turn lead other members \nof  the  community  to  employ  new  strategies  and  to \nachieve new outcomes, even if they were not them-\nselves participants in the project. If this type of trans-\nference occurs, as is possible, the benefits of taking a \nrandom sample could be availed to great effect.\n\nChallenge Three\n\nThe  project  team  needed  to  develop  a  detailed  un-\nderstanding  of  the  communities  within  which  the \nlegal  empowerment  interventions  were  undertaken. \nIn Bangladesh, for example, the project team quickly \ndiscovered  that,  among  the  three  main  study  areas \n(two  intervention  areas  and  one  control  area),  there \nwas considerable variation in people\u2019s levels of political \nawareness  and  administrative  engagement.  This  was \ntrue  even  before  the  pilot  projects  began.  And,  this \nwas  true  despite  the  fact  that  all  three  of  the  study \nareas were located fairly close together and exhibited \nbroadly  similar  demographic  characteristics.  In  fact, \npeople within the control area were significantly more \npolitically  astute  and  administratively  engaged  than \nthose in the intervention areas. In this particular area, a \nhistory of energetic involvement in local politics (spurred \nat least in part by an unusually active nongovernment \norganization [NGO] community) had led to much higher \nlevels of awareness and confidence, as well as a more \ndemanding community than in the other two areas in \nthe sample.\n\nThis was significant because it affected the mean-\ning of an empowerment improvement when it came \nto  evaluating  the  data.  A  cursory  look  at  the  data, \nfor example, might show a broadly similar trajectory \nwithin both the intervention districts and the control \ndistrict\u2014with both, for example, moving in roughly \nthe same pro-empowerment direction. This might lead \none to conclude that the interventions had no separate \nor  significant  impact;  after  all,  the  control  district  \u201c \nimproved\u201d in more or less the same way as the inter-\nvention districts. A closer look, however, clearly reveals \n\n\f68\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nthat the magnitude of the change in the intervention \ndistricts  was  much  larger  than  the  magnitude  of \nchange  in  the  control  district.  This  is  the  case  even \nthough, in the end, the intervention districts achieved \nresults that could be described as only half as strong \nas the result in the control district. Here again, one \nmight conclude that the legal empowerment interven-\ntions were somewhat ineffective because, of course, \nthe  results  in  the  intervention  districts  were  weaker \nthan the results in the control district. A deeper un-\nderstanding of the very different (preexisting) contexts \nin which the work was undertaken, however, allowed \nthe project team to interpret the data more accurately \nand conclude that the interventions did have a posi-\ntive impact. For example, in the context of the sample, \nempowerment improvements generally boiled down \nto a pattern of change in which the intervention dis-\ntricts finally began to catch up to already existing high \nlevels of empowerment in the control district. It bears \nrepeating that context specific knowledge can be very \nhelpful when it comes to interpreting the impact of \nspecific project interventions\u2014particularly in a broadly \ncomparative context.\n\nChallenge Four\n\nThere was a lack of progress on certain features of \nthe main development projects, which the legal em-\npowerment initiatives were intended to enhance. This \nchallenge was particularly acute in Bangladesh. The \naim  was  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  legal  empower-\nment  interventions  in  communities  benefiting  from \nan  ADB  loan  that  was  designed  to  support  water-\nspecific infrastructure like sluice gates and reinforced \nembankments. In particular, the project team sought \nto evaluate the impact of legal empowerment initia-\ntives that were designed to improve the management \nof that infrastructure, its maintenance, and the allo-\ncation/distribution of various user rights, including a \nvariety of employment opportunities relating to the \nconstruction, operation, and repair of the infrastruc-\nture itself. \n\nShortly after the pilot project was launched, how-\never, the project team discovered that the construc-\ntion phase of the various water-specific infrastructure \nprojects had not been completed. In other words, a \nsignificant component of the ADB initiative that the \nproject team had intended would engage with spe-\ncific legal empowerment interventions existed only on \n\npaper. This affected the results in a number of ways. \nIn particular, the project team found that the water \nmanagement associations that were set up to provide \nfor community-based participation in water manage-\nment  were  regarded,  not  as  a  water  management \nassociations per se, but rather as an important new \noutlet for local microcredit opportunities. When the \nproject team asked people how confident they were \nabout approaching the water management association \nfor  help  with  resolving  water-related  disputes  (both \nin the baseline study and in the final study), they felt \nthat the questions were somewhat irrelevant. In addi-\ntion, the project team found that people\u2019s knowledge \nof specific rights and responsibilities associated with \nthe proposed new infrastructure was limited by the \nfact that this infrastructure was not yet a part of their \npractical experience.\n\nThe project team could have restructured the M&E \nprotocol to address the facts on the ground. However, \nthis would have distanced the team from the primary \ngoal,  which  was  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  specific \nlegal empowerment initiatives with specific reference \nto the terms of an ADB loan. Even beyond this, major \ncontext specific adjustments in the research protocol \nwould have diminished or destroyed the ability to draw \nuseful  comparative  conclusions  across  Bangladesh, \nPakistan, and Indonesia.\n\nChallenge Five\n\nIn Pakistan, the project team had to deal with missing \ninstitutions. The project team wanted to evaluate the \nimpact of legal empowerment interventions in rural \nSindh, where ADB was involved in supporting a major \ngovernance reform initiative designed to devolve re-\nsponsibility for social service delivery to local commu-\nnities. Special attention was paid to the health sector \nand, more specifically, to the role of community-based \nhealth-monitoring committees charged with providing \nadministrative and financial oversight for physicians, \npharmacists, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and other \nfacilities. Very early on in the pilot projects, the project \nteam found that although local physicians, hospitals, \nand dispensaries were in place, they functioned very \npoorly. More importantly, the institutional lynchpin of \nthe devolution program, the health monitoring com-\nmittees, did not exist at all. Even the most vigorous and \nempowered citizens could not interface with important \naspects of the terms outlined in the ADB loan docu-\n\n\fAppendix 3\n\n69\n\nment because the institutional interface mentioned in \nthat document was not present.\n\nThis  was  an  important  discovery  that  posed  a \nnumber of unexpected challenges for the task at hand. \nIn fact, the challenge that the project team faced in \nPakistan was akin to evaluating the impact of a formal \nlegal aid initiative in a community with no concept of \na court or a judge. In addition, the pilot project was \nundertaken during the summer of \u0004007, when Pakistan \nwas embroiled in what many have described as the \nmost significant  assault  on  the Pakistani judiciary in \nmore than \u00040 years. This was followed by mass-based \npolitical protests. This unexpected turn of events led \nto a number of unexpected twists in the data. During \nthe  course  of  the  project,  the  intervention  districts \nin  Bangladesh  and  Indonesia  tended  to  move  away \nfrom the notion that noisy protests produce faster and \nbetter results. In Pakistan, the project team observed \na trend moving in exactly the opposite direction. The \nteam found that, even for those with health-related \nconcerns,  noisy  protests  were  expected  to  produce \nresults that were both faster and better. \n\nthe  baseline  data  provide  an  ADB-specific  baseline? \nTo what extent did evidence of improvement in the \ncontext of the baseline and the final survey point to \na  pattern  of  improvement  within  the  terms  of  the \nADB-specific pilot project? To what extent did improve-\nments  associated  with  the  World  Bank  project  turn \nup in the data? These questions were nearly impos-\nsible to answer without asking a series of additional \n(Indonesia-specific) survey questions\u2014questions that \nthe standardized three-country M&E survey protocol \ndid not anticipate.\n\nEven  single-country  studies  involving  multiple \nresearch locations require a very carefully coordinated \nplan to design, harmonize, test, and employ suitable \nsurvey instruments. As noted above, the potential for \nvariation  across  sites  is  not  limited  to  cross-country \nvariation. Even sector- and community-specific patterns \nof variation must be considered. Legal empowerment \nM&E  is  not  an  experimental  science  with  carefully \ncontrolled laboratory conditions. The challenges men-\ntioned above were selected to illustrate a range of is-\nsues that others are likely to encounter in the future. \n\nChallenge Six\n\nThis  challenge  emerged  in  Indonesia.  The  project \nteam  sought  to  assess  the  impact  of  specific  legal \nempowerment  interventions  in  communities  that \nADB  intended  to  support  through  activities  focused \non  urban  renewal,  small-scale  urban  infrastructure, \nand  private  shelter  upgrading.  Although  the  funds \nto finance these loans had been distributed and the \ninstitutions created for the purpose of evaluating ap-\nplications and distributing money, no loans had been \nmade. In other words, the project had not yet begun \nto affect the lives of local community members in ways \nthat might lend themselves to specific improvements \nvia legal empowerment. \n\nSerious difficulties were experienced in collating \nthe  baseline  data.  While  conducting  the  survey,  the \nproject  team  discovered  that  people  in  the  project \nareas had confused ADB\u2019s project with an overlapping \nsmall-scale urban poverty elimination project under-\ntaken  by  the  World  Bank\u2014Proyek  Penanggulangan \nKemiskinan Perkotaan. Consequently, in answering the \nsurvey,  respondents  inadvertently  referred  to  World \nBank\u2019s project rather than ADB\u2019s project. This caused \nthe  project  team  significant  difficulties  in  trying  to \ninterpret the results. For example, to what extent did \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n(Findings): Part A \n\nThe third section discusses the findings of the M&E \nefforts  in  greater  detail.  This  section  draws  par-\nticular  attention  to  the  fact  that  during  the  short \nimplementation  phase  of  this  legal  empowerment  \npilot project (less than \u0004 year, and in some cases as \nshort  as  8  months  of  intensive  program  activities) \nstronger results were generally encountered in terms of \n\u201craising legal awareness\u201d and \u201cincreasing confidence\u201d \nversus weaker results when it came to \u201cadopting new \nstrategies\u201d and \u201cachieving new outcomes.\u201d Additional \nattention is paid to the positive impact associated with \nkey pilot project partners in each country. \n\nNotwithstanding  the  numerous  challenges,  the \ndata  that  the  project  team  collected  produced  a \nnumber of important findings. This section highlights \nsix  important  findings  that  emerged  from  the  pilot \nprojects  in  all  three  project  countries  (Bangladesh, \nIndonesia, and Pakistan). The next section, focusing on \na set of tables disaggregated by income/expenditure, \neducation,  and  gender,  will  focus,  more  specifically, \non some of the results that the project team collected \nin Bangladesh.\n\n\f70\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nKey Finding One\n\nThe  most  fundamental  improvement  noted  by  the \nproject team was the change in people\u2019s attitude or con-\nfidence levels\u2014notably in Bangladesh and Indonesia.  \nThis change occurred despite the relatively short time \nframe within which the project was launched, under-\ntaken, and completed.\n\nThroughout the project, the team avoided placing \nany special emphasis on the value of legal empower-\nment training because it wanted to avoid any sugges-\ntion that such training might be \u201clearning for learning\u2019s \nsake.\u201d Instead, the team sought to stress the instrumen-\ntal value of that training\u2014in effect, \u201clearning to achieve \nX\u201d (where \u201cX\u201d is defined in terms of specific strategies \nand, ultimately, gender- and poverty-based outcomes). \nThe project\u2019s very short time frame made this goal par-\nticularly difficult to achieve. However, those engaged in \nvarious types of legal empowerment initiatives should \nnot  be  too  quick  to  discount  the  value  of  increased \nlevels of confidence alone. Several aspects of the survey \nindicated noticeable improvements in confidence levels \nduring the course of the pilot projects.\n\nTherefore, if increased confidence levels improve \npeople\u2019s capacity to participate in dispute resolution, \nit may be worthwhile to include confidence-building \ninitiatives in future projects.\n\nConfidence in Participating in the Water \nManagement Cooperative Associations\u2019 (WMCA) \nDecision-Making Process\nAt the project\u2019s commencement, the team expected to \nfind that nonpoor members of society, or those with sec-\nondary or higher levels of education, would dominate the  \ndecision-making processes of the WMCAs. As women \nand the poor tend to have lower levels of education, the \nproject team expected that women and the poor would \nexert little influence over the WMCAs\u2019 decision-making \nprocesses. The baseline survey showed that there was \nwidespread poverty in the surveyed areas. About 70% \nof people in the project and control areas were poor, \nwith  an  average  monthly  household  expenditure  of \nless than Tk4,000.\u0004 Also, 40% of people in project and \ncontrol areas were illiterate and another \u00049% of people \nin project intervention areas had not completed primary \neducation\u2014this figure was \u0004\u0004% in control areas. \n\n\u0004  This is equivalent to $\u00049 as of July \u0004008.\n\nThe baseline survey also assessed people\u2019s views \nabout whether they were exerting any influence over \nWMCA decisions. About 4\u0004% of WMCA members in \nproject intervention areas and \u00040% of the members in \ncontrol areas believed that they had a say in the WMCAs\u2019  \ndecision-making  processes  (Table  A\u0004.\u0004).\u0004  More  than \n\u0004\u0004%  of  males  and  \u0004\u0004%  of  females  in  project  inter-\nvention areas believed they had a say in their WMCA, \ncompared to \u00040% of both males and females in control \nareas. The preponderance of poverty in the subproject \nareas and the sheer weight of representation of women \nand the poor in the WMCAs seemed to indicate that \nthose among the poor who were alert and outspoken \nwould indeed be able to assert themselves and ensure \nthat their rights were protected to the extent that they \nwere actually aware of those rights. The final survey \nshows that this expectation was indeed somewhat real-\nized\u2014\u00049% of WMCA members in project intervention \nareas and \u0004\u0004% in control areas believed that they have \na say in WMCAs\u2019 decision-making processes. \n\nConfidence in Approaching the WMCA and/or \nLocal Neighborhood Improvement Committees \n(BKMs)\nThe  project  team  wanted  to  assess  how  confident \npeople  were  in  approaching  their  WMCA.  At  the \ncommencement of the pilot projects, \u0004\u0004% of people \nin the project intervention areas and \u0004\u0004% of people \nin  the  control  areas  felt  that  they  could  approach \nthe  WMCA  management  committee  on  their  own  \n(Table A\u0004.\u0004). The final survey showed that more than \n\u00040% of people in the project intervention areas (4\u0004% \nin control areas) held the same belief. The fact that \npeople  had  increased  confidence  with  approaching \ntheir  WMCAs  in  both  areas  suggests  that  the  pilot \nproject had some degree of success. This conclusion \nis supported by the fact that only 4% of people in the \nproject intervention areas believed it was impossible \nto approach the management committee. In contrast, \n\u00040% of the control population believed it was impos-\n\n\u0004  The large percentage of respondents who did not know how \nto answer this question can be explained by the fact that the \nWMCAs in the two subproject areas were newly formed, and \nthe subprojects themselves were not completed. Once the \nsubproject-created infrastructure becomes fully operational, the \nissue of user rights and responsibilities will come into focus. It \nis then that more members will be able to comment less specu-\nlatively on how much of a say they have in WMCA decisions.\n\n\fTable A3.1: Bangladesh\u2014Do WMCA members think they have any say in its decision-making processes?\n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nAppendix 3\n\n71\n\nWMCA = water management cooperative association, % = percent of respondents.\n\nTable A3.2:  Survey results regarding confidence in approaching the WMCA (Bangladesh) \n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nYes\n\nNo \n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nTotal\n\n \n\n \n\nI approached/can approach the  \nmanagement committee on my own\n\nI required/may require help, support, \nor assistance from others\n\nIt was/may be impossible to approach \nthe WMCA management committee\n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nTotal\n\n40.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.4 \n\n\u00047.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u00049.\u0004 \n\n\u00047.\u0004 \n\n8.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004\n\n100.0 \n\n\u00040.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.7 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.4 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004.4 \n\n\u00047.0\n\n100.0 \n\n\u00049.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.8 \n\n9.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u00040.\u0004 \n\n\u00047.8 \n\n4.\u0004 \n\n\u00047.8\n\n100.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u00044.\u0004 \n\n\u0004.8 \n\n100.0 \n\n4\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.8 \n\n\u00049.\u0004 \n\n\u00047.\u0004\n\n100.0 \n\nWMCA = water management cooperative association, % = percent of respondents.\n\nsible. If the poor feel excluded because traditionally \nthey have been excluded, legal empowerment training \ncan indeed be considered as having helped them to \nbe  more  confident.  This  is  particularly  so  if  it  helps \nthem approach the WMCA management committees \nabout relevant matters.\n\nThe  project  team  also  saw  positive  results  in \nIndonesia,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  legal \nawareness  training.  Relative  to  the  baseline,  there \nwas a large increase in the project intervention areas \nin the percentage of people who believed that they \ncould approach the BKM management committees \non their own. Conversely, there was a fall in control \nareas  (Table  A\u0004.\u0004).  Moreover,  the  percentage  of \npeople  who  responded  \u201cdon\u2019t  know\u201d  was  much \nhigher in control areas than in project intervention \nareas. This indicates that people had distinct opinions \nin project intervention areas, but were less certain in \ncontrol areas. \n\nConfidence in Approaching a Government Office\nRespondents were asked if they were confident in their \nability  to  follow  typical  instructions  given  to  them  by \ngovernment  offices  when  they  approached  these  of-\nfices for receiving some public service. Instructions could \nrelate to completing various forms, visiting some other \noffice, phoning some number, or doing other functions. \nThe baseline survey showed that \u0004\u0004% of respondents in \nboth the project and control areas were extremely unsure \nabout their ability to follow official instructions (Table 4). \nAbout \u00040% of the respondents in the project intervention \nareas (\u00040% in control areas) said they were somewhat, \nor extremely, confident. The final survey showed that in \nthe project intervention areas there was no noticeable \nchange in the percentage of people who were somewhat, \nor extremely confident, while there was a sharp decline \nin the percentage in control areas. In control areas, there \nwas also a sharp increase in the percentage of people \nwho were unsure about what to say in this respect. \n\n\f72\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nTable A3.3: Indonesia\u2014If you approached or were to approach the BKM, would you feel confident to \napproach this organization on your own or would you require assistance from others?\n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\n7\u0004.\u0004 \n\n4\u0004.0 \n\nI approached/can approach the  \nmanagement committee on my own\n\nI required/may require help, support, \nor assistance from others\n\nIt was/may be impossible to approach \nthe BKM management committee\n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nTotal\n\n \n\n \n\nExtremely confident about your  \nability to follow these instructions\n\nSomewhat confident about your  \nability to follow these instructions\n\nExtremely  unsure  about  your  ability \nto follow these instructions\n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nTotal\n\n% = percent of respondents.\n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u00047.\u0004 \n\n\u00040.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u00047.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u00040.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.0 \n\n\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u00047.\u0004 \n\n4\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u00047.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\n8.8 \n\n\u0004.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.8 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.4 \n\n\u0004\u0004.0 \n\n\u00048.8 \n\n\u0004\u0004.7 \n\n100.0 \n\n7.\u0004 \n\n7.\u0004 \n\n40.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.7 \n\n\u00049.4 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\nBKM = local neighborhood improvement committee, % = percent of respondents.\n\nTable A3.4: Bangladesh\u2014Confidence in ability to follow official instructions when approaching a \ngovernment office for some service\n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nParticipation in Local Decision Making\nThe  respondents  were  asked  whether,  during  the \nlast year, they had seen any change in their ability to \nparticipate in local decision-making processes concern-\ning  water  for  agriculture  or  fishing  purposes.  They \nwere also asked whether, if they had not participated \ndirectly, they felt they could quite easily participate if \nthey wanted. In the baseline survey, respondents were \ndivided in their answers to this question (Table A\u0004.\u0004). \nIt is likely that the respondents based their answers on \ntheir actual degree of participation in their WMCAs, \n\nand at the time of the baseline survey that was very \nlimited. \n\nThe respondents were also asked whether the legal \nempowerment training had resulted in them chang-\ning any of their views. In the baseline survey, about \n\u0004\u0004% of respondents in both project and control areas \nstated that they could participate easily. However, these \npercentages increased to 4\u0004% in project intervention \nareas and to \u00049% in control areas. Moreover, those \nwho said they could not participate easily decreased \nin project intervention areas and increased in control \n\n\fAppendix 3\n\n73\n\nTable A3.5:  Bangladesh\u2014Do respondents feel that, during the last year, they could participate (quite \neasily) if they wanted to in local decision-making processes concerning water for agriculture or fishing \npurposes?\n\n \n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nYes, I feel that I could participate  \n(easily) if I wanted to \n\nNo, I do not feel that I could participate \n(easily) if I wanted to\n\nI don\u2019t know\n\nTotal \n\n% = percent of respondents.\n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u00040.\u0004 \n\n\u00048.8 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u0004\u0004.7 \n\n\u0004\u0004.7 \n\n\u00044.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\n4\u0004.8 \n\n\u0004\u0004.7 \n\n\u00040.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\n\u00049.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n100.0 \n\nareas.  While  the  differences  may  not  be  significant, \nthey suggest that there was improvement in the project \nintervention areas. Realistically, it is too early to predict \nwhether there will be long-term changes.\n\nOne implication of these findings is that commu-\nnity members now complain more easily given their \nincreased levels of confidence. This was apparent in the \nfact that the baseline and final surveys often indicated \na difference in the number of respondents willing to \nsay that \u201cyes, [water, health, or shelter] problems exist \nin my area,\u201d even if their responses to later questions \nindicated that they were not yet prepared to adopt new \nstrategies to cope with or address those problems.\n\nIndeed,  increasing  levels  of  confidence  may  be \nrelated,  in  the  first  instance,  to  increasing  levels  of \nawareness  coupled  with  frustration.  Of  course,  this \nfrustration  may  be  an  essential  bridging  concept \nbetween new levels of confidence and new forms of \naction. Again, the time frame did not provide sufficient \ntime to examine the extent to which this hypothesis \nmight be borne out by the evidence. But, in the fu-\nture, those responsible for constructing robust M&E \nframeworks for long-term legal empowerment projects \nmay wish to investigate this issue through a targeted \nmid-program review.\n\nKey Finding Two\n\nThe second key finding is closely related to the first. The \ndata showed no change in existing outcomes defined \nin  terms  of  poverty  reduction  or  tangible,  practical, \n\nobservable expressions of gender equality. This lack of \nobservable change in existing outcomes must be read \nin light of the pilot projects\u2019 time frame constraints. It \nis simply too soon to tell whether increasing levels of \nconfidence  leading  to  increasing  levels  of  frustration \nmight lead to new dispute resolution strategies that, \nin turn, produce new outcomes.\n\nNote that in the sixth and final finding below, some \nattention will be paid to a growing sense that men \nand women enjoy equal access to particular dispute \nresolution  forums;  however,  this  growing  sense  of \ngender neutral access does not represent an empirical \nchange in existing outcomes, but rather an intangible \nor theoretical belief in equal access.\n\nKey Finding Three\n\nDuring the course of each pilot-project initiative, many \nmeasurable improvements were observed in the context \nof specific intervention areas. However, in most cases \nthe same improvements were observed in the control \nareas as well. \n\nFor example, in Bangladesh and Indonesia, respon-\ndents from pilot-project intervention areas demonstrated \na greater willingness to engage official procedures at the \nend of the pilot-project period (Table A\u0004.\u0004). However, \nthis willingness was observed regardless of whether they \npersonally  participated  in  local  trainings,  workshops, \nand information sessions designed to familiarize them \nwith various features of the relevant ADB loan initia-\ntive. In other words, respondents reported that, if they \n\n\f74\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nwere  confronted  with  a  water  problem  (Bangladesh) \nor a shelter problem (Indonesia), they would be more \ninclined to engage official procedures.\n\nIn response to a closely related set of questions, the \nsame group appeared to change their previously held \nviews about the value of noisy protest action, noting at \nthe end of the pilot-project period that individuals facing \nwater or shelter problems would be better served by an \neffort to engage existing formal rules and procedures \n(Table  A\u0004.\u0004).  In  other  words,  official  procedures  ap-\npeared to become more attractive and accessible over \nthe course of the pilot-project intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, these same results were observed in \nthe control areas, making it impossible to attribute this \nimprovement to the legal empowerment interventions \nundertaken in the context of the pilot projects alone.\n\nKey Finding Four\n\nThe fourth implication that may be drawn from the \nfindings  relates  to  dispute  resolution  strategies.  The \ndominant  dispute  resolution  strategies  tend  to  vary \nwithin countries as much as they vary between them. \nThe  qualitative  data  revealed  a  higher  level  of  com-\nfort with dispute resolution patterns tied to existing \n\nadministrative structures in Bangladesh, for example, \nthan the project team found in either Pakistan or In-\ndonesia (Tables A\u0004.8, A\u0004.8a, and A\u0004.8b). In Pakistan, \nthe team found a much stronger tendency to pursue \ndispute resolution strategies tied to local family and/or \nlocal  kinship  structures.  In  Indonesia,  the  team  en-\ncountered a pattern in which local community-based \npolitical  actors  (including  elected  politicians)  played \na larger role. \n\nIt  is  important  to  appreciate  that  variations  in \nthe  legal  empowerment  baseline  for  each  country \nmay not mean the same thing. For example, the sig-\nnificant increase in the percentage of people seeking \nhelp  from  family  members  for  dispute  resolution  in \nPakistan may result from a rather modest increase in \nconfidence levels in more formal mechanisms such as \nthe health-monitoring committee or mediation by local \npoliticians. Therefore, a modest change in local dispute \nresolution strategies may result in significant changes. \nIn Bangladesh, an increased approach to the WMCAs \nfor dispute resolution marks a significant change in the \nevolution of dispute resolution mechanisms. Even in \nthe context of a significant cross-country comparative \nresearch project, the interpretation of results must be \ndeeply contextualized.\n\nTable A3.6: Are Better and Faster Responses Obtained if People Avoid Noisy Protests and \u201cFollow the Rules?\u201d \n\nBangladesh\n\nPakistan\n\nIndonesia\n\nBaseline %\n\nFinal %\n\nBaseline %\n\nFinal %\n\nBaseline %\n\nFinal %\n\nProgram \nArea\n\nControl \nArea\n\nProgram \nArea\n\nControl \nArea\n\nProgram \nArea\n\nControl \nArea\n\nProgram \nArea\n\nControl \nArea\n\nProgram \nArea\n\nControl \nArea\n\nProgram \nArea\n\nControl \nArea\n\n\u00040 \n\n\u00048\n\n7\u0004\n\n\u00049 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u00048\n\n4\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u00040 \n\n\u00047 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n8 \n\n\u0004\n\n\u0004 \n\n\u00040\n\n\u00040\n\n\u00044 \n\n8 \n\n9\n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\nThe response is \nboth better and \nfaster \n\nThe response is \nfaster only (i.e., \nnot necessarily \nbetter)\n\nThe response is \nbetter only (i.e., \nnot necessarily \nfaster) \n\nThe response is \nneither better \nnor faster \n\n8\n\n8\n\n0\n\n\u0004\n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u00049 \n\n\u00044 \n\n\u00040 \n\n\u0004\u0004\n\n\u00044 \n\n44 \n\n\u0004\u0004\n\n\u00048 \n\n\u00040 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u00047 \n\n\u00047 \n\n0 \n\n\u0004\u0004\n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n8 \n\n\u00040 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nTotal\n\n\u00044 \n\n100 \n\n\u0004\u0004 \n\n100 \n\n\u0004\u0004\n\n4\u0004 \n\n100\n\n4\u0004 \n\n100\n\n\u0004\u0004\n\n100\n\n\u00048 \n\n100\n\n8\n\n100 \n\n\u00040 \n\n100\n\n\u0004 \n\n0 \n\n100\n\n100\n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n% = percent of respondents.\n\n\fAppendix 3\n\n75\n\nIn Bangladesh, one of the villages in the project in-\ntervention area struggled with the problem of too much \nwater.

This data point suggests that \nin a legal empowerment context, the first challenge in \nIndonesia does not lay in providing residents with the \nconfidence,  knowledge,  and  strategies  for  obtaining \nmodest ADB-funded home improvement loans. Rather, \nthe first step is in drawing attention to the fact that many \nlocal residents are simply unaware of the extent to which \naccess  to  home  improvement  loans  follows  from  the \n\nexistence of a formal title. This data point also suggests \nthat project designers need a better understanding of the \nvarious types of semiformal or informal land certificates \nthat are traditionally used in Indonesia. \n\nKey Finding Five\n\nThe fifth factor to be drawn from the data relates to \nthe  findings  regarding  knowledge.  The  project  team \nencountered particular improvements in the knowledge \nbase of those living in the project intervention areas tar-\ngeted by specific pilot-project initiatives. Four examples \nfrom  Bangladesh,  each  drawing  attention  to  specific \nprovisions within the ADB loan document, should serve \n\n\fAppendix 3\n\n77\n\nto illustrate this point. The first example concerns the \neligibility rules for joining the local WMCA. The project \nteam found that respondents in the intervention villages \ndemonstrated  increasing  knowledge  of  their  eligibility \nto join their local WMCA, whereas those in the control \ndistricts  appeared  to  move  in  the  opposite  direction \n(Table A\u0004.8).\n\nThe second example concerns the issue of mainte-\nnance costs related to specific types of water infrastruc-\nture, such as sluice gates. The project team found that \nrespondents in the intervention villages improved their \nknowledge about who was responsible for maintain-\ning water infrastructure in the wake of targeted pilot \nproject training sessions (Table A\u0004.9). The project team \nalso found that villagers in the control districts had a \nbetter understanding of this issue. However, the differ-\nentiating factor between the intervention and control \n\nvillages was that in the control villages, a significantly \nlarger number of villagers did not know who was re-\nsponsible for maintaining water infrastructure. In the \nproject  intervention  villages,  the  number  of  people \nwho did not know this issue shrank significantly. The \nproject team considered this demonstrated that the \ninterventions were successful.\n\nThe third example concerns the legal ownership \nof the WMCA buildings. Here again, the project team \nfound that there were larger numbers of respondents \nwho were getting close to the correct answer. However, \nthere  was  an  opposite  trend  in  the  control  districts \n(Table A\u0004.\u00040).\n\nThe fourth and final example concerns knowledge \nregarding the maintenance and repair of the WMCA \nbuildings.  As  in  the  second  example,  the  project \nteam  encountered  two  important  pieces  of  data.  \n\nTable A3.9: Bangladesh\u2014Who is expected to pay for the maintenance of the sluice gate, etc. constructed \nunder the subproject?\n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\n \n\n \n\nLGED \n\nWMCA\n\nGovernment \n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nTotal\n\nLGED \n\nWMCA \n\nGovernment \n\nPrivate Donor \n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nTotal\n\nLGED = Local Government Engineering Department, WMCA = water management cooperative association, % = percent of respondents.\n\n 100.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\nTable A3.10: Bangladesh\u2014Who owns the WMCA office building?\n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\n 8.7 \n\n \u0004\u0004.0 \n\n 8.7 \n\n \u00040.\u0004 \n\n \u0004.9 \n\n 49.\u0004 \n\n \u0004.9 \n\n \u0004.0 \n\n 4\u0004.7 \n\n 100.0 \n\n \u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n \u00047.\u0004 \n\n 9.\u0004 \n\n \u0004\u0004.9 \n\n 7.7 \n\n \u0004\u0004.9 \n\n \u0004.8 \n\n \u2013 \n\n \u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n 100.0 \n\n \u0004\u0004.9 \n\n \u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n \u0004.7 \n\n \u00048.8 \n\n \u0004.\u0004 \n\n \u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n \u0004.4 \n\n \u2013\n\n \u00048.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\n 9.8 \n\n \u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n \u2013 \n\n \u00044.9 \n\n 100.0 \n\n \u0004.0 \n\n 4\u0004.\u0004 \n\n \u2013\n\n \u0004.9 \n\n \u0004\u0004.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\nLGED = Local Government Engineering Department, WMCA = water management cooperative association, % = percent of respondents.\n\n\f78\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nTable A3.11: Bangladesh\u2014Who will pay for repair and maintenance of the WMCA building?\n\n \n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nWMCA \n\nLGED/Government \n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nTotal\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\n 40.8 \n\n \u0004\u0004.\u0004 \n\n 4\u0004.\u0004 \n\n \u0004\u0004.9 \n\n \u0004\u0004.0 \n\n 48.\u0004 \n\n \u00049.\u0004 \n\n \u0004.7 \n\n \u00048.8 \n\n 4\u0004.\u0004 \n\n \u0004.0 \n\n \u0004\u0004.9 \n\n 100.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\nLGED = Local Government Engineering Department, WMCA = water management cooperative association, % = percent of respondents.\n\nTable A3.12: Do men and women have \u201cequal access\u201d to the WMCA/HMC/BKM?\n\nBangladesh\n\nPakistan\n\nIndonesia\n\nDo men and women have \u201cequal \naccess\u201d to the WMCA management \ncommittee?

In contrast, there \nwas a modest increase in the number of people who \ndid not know the answer to this question in the control \nvillages (Table A\u0004.\u0004\u0004).\n\nKey Finding Six\n\nThis is perhaps the most important of the findings. The \nproject team encountered a common trend in all three \ncountries with respondents living in specifically targeted \n\nproject intervention areas. There was a consistent pat-\ntern of improvement in the extent to which both men \nand women (in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan) \nand poor and nonpoor residents (in Bangladesh and \nIndonesia) were believed to enjoy equal access to the \nformal legal and administrative forums associated with \ntheir respective ADB loans (Tables A\u0004.\u0004\u0004 and A\u0004.\u0004\u0004). \n\nIn  some  cases,  a  very  similar  trend  in  favor  of \nincreasing  equal  access  can  be  seen  in  the  control \nareas. However, in every case, the magnitude of this \nchange in the project intervention areas is noticeably \nlarger.\n\nOne final point must be highlighted. The project \nteam repeatedly found that those living in targeted \nproject  intervention  areas  gained  both  confidence \n\n\fAppendix 3\n\n79\n\nTable A3.13: Bangladesh\u2014Do you think that poor and nonpoor households have equal access to the \nWMCA management committee?\n\n \n\nBaseline (%)\n\nFinal (%)\n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nTotal\n\nDon\u2019t know\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\nProgram Area\n\nControl Area\n\n 48.\u0004 \n\n \u00044.\u0004 \n\n \u0004\u0004.9 \n\n \u00049.\u0004 \n\n 0.0 \n\n \u00040.8 \n\n 78.0 \n\n \u0004.4 \n\n \u00048.\u0004 \n\n \u00044.9 \n\n \u0004.0 \n\n 4\u0004.\u0004 \n\n 100.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\nWMCA = water management cooperative association, % = percent of respondents.\n\nand  knowledge  in  the  wake  of  carefully  targeted \nlegal  empowerment  interventions.  Despite  this, \nthese respondents did not always seek to carve out \nnew approaches to existing resources, services, and \nopportunities  in  the  context  of  particular  legal  and \nadministrative procedures. In other words, many of \nthe  respondents  did  not  develop  new  strategies  to \naddress their water-, health-, or shelter-related prob-\nlems  by  approaching  relevant  government  offices \ndirectly for mandated services or dispute resolution, \nparticularly when those offices were at a higher level \nof government. \n\nInstead of creating new strategies, the villagers \nused their new knowledge and confidence to pressure \ntheir local intermediaries to help them (the villages) in \nnew\u2014but also quite familiar\u2014ways. In Bangladesh, \nfor  example,  respondents  living  in  the  intervention \ndistricts did not always use their new knowledge and \nhigher  levels  of  confidence  to  approach  the  Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED) directly \nto address their water problems. Instead, they tended \nto use their newfound confidence to pressure local \nmembers of the WMCA to approach the department \non their behalf. \n\nIn Indonesia, those living in the intervention dis-\ntricts tended to use their newly acquired knowledge to \npress their shelter-related demands within the offices \nassociated with existing local headmen. However, they \ndid not attempt to approach the land registration of-\nfice on their own. \n\nIn  fact,  what  the  project  team  found  in  both \ncountries was a pattern in which legal empowerment \ninterventions did not transform existing networks of \n\ncommunity-based affinity and support. Instead, they \nsimply  enhanced  these  relationships\u2014turning  them \never so slightly in the direction of new forms of en-\ngagement with existing rules, existing regulations, and \nexisting formal rights.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n(Findings): Part B\n\nThis section focuses on results collected in Bangladesh, \nilluminated through a set of tables disaggregated by \ngender, education, and income/expenditure.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Background\n\nGender\nAt the end of project survey, about \u0004\u0004% of the respon-\ndents in project and control areas were male.\n\nEducation Level\nData from the final survey show that the incidence of  \nilliteracy  was  high  in  both  project  and  control  areas \n(Table  A\u0004.\u00044).

There was a \ncorresponding decrease in the percentage of people \nwho thought they would still need assistance or sup-\nport from others (Table A\u0004.\u0004\u0004). \n\nThe  project  team  observed  that  recipients  of \neducation sessions in project intervention areas were \nmore confident with approaching the WMCAs on their \nown. This included respondents who were illiterate, \ndid not complete primary school education, or were \n\n\ffrom  poorer  households.  This  was  also  observed  in \ncontrol areas. \n\nLikewise, women were observed to have benefited \nfrom  the  legal  empowerment  trainings.  In  project \nintervention areas, women were more confident with \napproaching  the  WMCA  management  committees \non their own, and there was a large reduction in the \npercentage of women who find it impossible to ap-\nproach the WMCA (Table A\u0004.\u0004\u0004a). Exactly the opposite \nis observed in control areas, where more than \u0004\u0004% of \nwomen  thought  it  was  impossible  to  approach  the \nWMCA. This is up from less than \u00040% in the baseline \nfigures.\n\nMeasuring Strategies and Actions\n\nOfficial Procedures, Informal Connections, or Both?\nWhen people are faced with problems regarding water \nfor agriculture or fishing purposes (for example, water \nsharing  or  local  water  rates),  they  generally  look  for \nhelp. Sometimes, they try official procedures such as \napproaching  the  WMCA,  the  union  parishad  4office, \nor LGED. If this does not work, they may turn to in-\nformal connections to get through to the responsible \nauthorities. Sometimes they try both at the same time. \nIt is instructive to know if, as a result of the legal em-\npowerment trainings, people are trying to use official \nprocedures more frequently. \n\nThe baseline results indicated that a large major-\nity of people had never resorted to official procedures \nto resolve water problems, as intimated by the large \npercentage of people who answered \u201cno response\u201d \n(Table A\u0004.\u00047). It must be remembered that the proj-\nect infrastructure was not yet complete in the pilot- \nproject intervention areas at the time of the baseline \nsurvey,  although  both  the  WMCA  and  LGED  were \noperational.  As  a  result,  people  may  not  have  been \naware that their water problems were resulting from \ninfrastructure problems. Once water problems could \nbe  causally  linked  to  formal  infrastructure  (or  lack \nthereof), it seemed likely that respondents would be \nmore willing and able to seek solutions to their water \nproblems through formal mechanisms. For example, \nthey might approach their WMCA, which is respon-\nsible  for  operating  the  completed  infrastructure.  As  \n\n4  The union parishad is the lowest tier of local elected govern-\n\nment in Bangladesh.\n\nAppendix 3\n\n81\n\nTable A\u0004.\u00047 shows, this seems to have happened. In \nthe final survey, about 40% of the respondents said \nthat they were always using official procedures. This \nmeans that the percentage of people who said that \nthey  never  used  official  procedures  or  responded \n\u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d shrank from about 80% of respondents \nto about 44%. While a similar change occurred in con-\ntrol areas, the number of people who answered \u201cno \nresponse\u201d to this issue increased to more than \u00040%. \nThis suggests that the majority of the population still \nhas doubts about using official procedures. \n\nWhile  both  the  education  groups  have  been \nimpacted,  those  who  completed  class  V  and  above \nshowed a much greater shift to using official proce-\ndures. If the sample size were large enough to permit \nmore  education  groupings,  it  would  be  likely  that \nhigher education levels would be seen to be strongly \nassociated with higher rates of adoption of use of of-\nficial procedures to mitigate water problems. \n\nLooking  at  it  from  a  gender  perspective,  it  is \nobserved that both men and women in both project \nand control areas are taking recourse to using official \nprocedures  more  frequently;  however,  men  were \nmuch more inclined to this option (Table A\u0004.\u00048). The \npercentage of women who gave no response to this \nquestion  declined  in  project  intervention  areas  but \nincreased in control areas. This suggests that women \nwere more adept at using official procedures in project \nintervention areas\u2014quite a reversal from the baseline \nsituation.  This  could  be  attributed  to  the  intensive \nconfidence building of women by the legal empower-\nment initiatives.\n\nAs a follow-up to the above question, respondents \nwere asked about where they seek help from if faced \nwith a problem involving water for agriculture or fish-\ning purposes and they believe that the problem involves \nanother citizen in their community. In the baseline situ-\nation, a majority of respondents gave no response to \nthis question. It is likely they had not previously faced \nsuch  a  situation,  or  even  if  they  had,  they  did  not \nconsider it significant enough to seek help elsewhere. \nAgain, it must be kept in mind that until infrastructure \nis fully operational, people may be unable to blame their \nproblems on any person or group. Once the structures \nare fully in place and a recognizable person or group \nis responsible for their operation, it is more likely that \npeople will begin to frame their problems in terms of \ninvolving other people in the community. \n\n\fProgram Area\n\nI approached, or can \napproach, the WMCA \nmanagement commit-\ntee on my own\n\nI required, or may \nrequire, help, support, \nor

\nfirst recourse was taking advice from family members \n(Table  A\u0004.\u00049).  This  increased  to  \u00049%  in  program \nintervention  areas  in  the  final  survey,  but  remained \nabout the same in control areas. True WMCA activi-\nties with respect to management of water supply had \nnot properly begun during the baseline survey, and \npeople did not consider it as an important court of \nappeal  when  faced  with  conflicts  related  to  water \navailability.  The  final  survey  revealed  that  this  had \nchanged.  Thirty-eight  percent  of  respondents  in \nproject intervention areas mentioned that the WMCA \nwas their first point of contact for help, while only \n\u0004\u0004% thought this in control areas. The percentage of \nrespondents not responding to the question declined \nfrom 4\u0004% to \u0004\u0004% in project intervention areas, but \nremained about the same in control areas, at about \n\u0004\u0004% of respondents, signifying that in control areas \nmany people were yet to view the WMCAs as arbiters \nfor water-related disputes.\n\nDoes  Education  Level  Make  a  Difference  to \nWhether People are More Likely to Use Official \nProcedures to Resolve Disputes?\nThe final survey revealed an increase in the percentage \nof illiterate or less educated people who approached \nfamily  members  for  help  when  faced  with  water- \nrelated disputes. It also showed a fall in the percent-\nage  of  more  educated  people  who  sought  family  \nassistance.  However,  this  change  was  more  pro-\nnounced  in  project  intervention  areas.  Clearly,  in \nthese areas, the WMCAs have emerged as important \ninstitutions for voicing grievances and seeking redress, \nparticularly  so  for  people  in  the  higher  education \ngroup, who exhibited a more dramatic shift toward \nusing  their  WMCA.  While  the  same  shift  seems  to \nhave occurred in control areas, the magnitude of the \nchange was lower, implying that in control areas, the \nWMCAs have not yet fully emerged as an important \navenue for dispute resolution. Interestingly, the control \narea appeared to be more politically engaged than the \nproject intervention areas, especially when it came to \napproaching the union parishad. \n\nIf  the  data  are  broken  down  by  gender,  similar \nresults are seen. In project intervention areas, both men \nand women made a dramatic switch toward using their \nWMCA as their first means of resolving water-related \n\nAppendix 3\n\n85\n\nproblems  (Table  A\u0004.\u00040).  Family  members  remained \nimportant  as  an  avenue  for  venting  grievances  and \nseeking  advice,  especially  for  women.  There  was  a \nlarge fall in the number of \u201cno responses\u201d from both \nmen and women, implying greater certainty on their \npart as to where they could seek redress. In control \nareas, there was a much less spectacular increase in \nthe importance of the WMCA in this respect, and the \nimportance  of  family  members  remained  about  the \nsame as it did in the baseline. The union parishad also \nretained  its  position  as  an  arbiter.  The  no-response \nrate  in  the  control  areas  remained  large,  especially \nfor women who still had no well-marked avenue for \nventing grievances.\n\nProtesting as a Strategy\nWhen the people in a community face a problem, they \nmay resort to noisy protests as a strategy to attract \nattention  and  ultimately  force  a  positive  response. \nAlternatively, they may just try to follow the rules and \nhope that the system will provide a positive response. \nThe respondents were surveyed on their attitude to-\nward these respective strategies. \n\nThe baseline survey revealed that, in project inter-\nvention areas, \u00040% of the respondents believed that \nnoisy protests neither attracted attention nor evoked \na positive response (Table A\u0004.\u0004\u0004). The final survey re-\nsults indicated that this percentage increased sharply \nfor respondents in both education groups. Also, the \npercentage of respondents who believed that protests \nattracted attention, whether with a positive response \nor without, fell sharply for the educated group from \n\u00040%  to  less  than  \u0004%  of  respondents.\u0004  Control  area \nresidents,  particularly  those  with  some  education, \nalso believed that protests had little power to produce \nresults, and it is difficult to say whether legal empower-\nment training has anything to do with this belief. \n\nAn  overwhelming  majority  of  both  men  and \nwomen believed that protests did not attract attention \nor elicit a positive response (Table A\u0004.\u0004\u0004). However, this \nbelief was held by about 90% of the female respon-\ndents in the project intervention areas and by only \u0004\u0004% \nin the control areas. Also, about \u0004\u0004% of the women \nin  the  control  areas  gave  no  response  compared  to \nless than \u00040% in the project intervention areas. These \n\n\u0004  A similar result is observed if respondents are disaggregated \n\nby poor and nonpoor groups.\n\n\f86\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nTable A3.19: Where

be attributed to the success of the legal \nempowerment training.\n\nFollowing Rules as a Strategy\nOn the other hand, opinion was much more divided \non the question of speed and quality of response when \nnoisy protests are avoided and people chose to follow \nthe rules. The baseline survey showed that about \u00040% \nof  the  members  in  project  intervention  areas  (over \n40% in control areas) thought that the response was \nusually better and faster if rules were followed; this \nincreased to about 70% in both project and control \nareas at the time of the final survey (Table A\u0004.\u0004\u0004). The \nincrease is much greater in project intervention areas, \nand  can  be  attributed  to  the  legal  empowerment \ntraining,  par-ticularly  as  it  influenced  the  illiterate \nand less-educated respondents. Supporting this is the \nfact that the nonresponse rate for the less educated-\ngroup declined from \u0004\u0004% to less than \u00040% in project \nintervention areas while it actually increased in control \nareas. The less-educated respondents could obviously \narticulate their beliefs more strongly at the end of the \nlegal empowerment project than at the beginning. \n\nThe survey results can be further broken down into \npoor and nonpoor groups. About 70% of respondents \nin both groups in both project and control areas be-\nlieved that they achieved a better and faster response \nto their problems by following rules. This compares \nwith \u00047% and \u00040% of poor and nonpoor (respectively) \nin  the  baseline  survey  in  project  intervention  areas, \nand  \u00040%  and  \u00040%  in  control  areas  (respectively)  \n(Table A\u0004.\u00044). Obviously, the change in perception was \nstronger in project intervention areas and particularly \nstrong  for  the  poor.  Since  the  legal  empowerment \ntraining  paid  particular  attention  to  disadvantaged \ngroups\u2014women and the poor\u2014the efficacy of that \ntraining is attested by the results. \n\nIn both areas, there was a large increase in the \npercentage of women who believed in following the \nrules\u2014from \u0004\u0004% to \u0004\u0004% in the project intervention \nareas, and \u0004\u0004% to \u00047% in control areas (Table A\u0004.\u0004\u0004). \nClearly, the change was greater in project intervention \nareas  and  attests  again  to  the  success  of  the  legal \nempowerment initiative.\n\n\fTable A3.23: Are Better and Faster Responses Obtained if People Avoid Noisy Protests and \u201cFollow the \nRules\u201d?\u2014by Education Groups (%)\n\nProgram Area\n\nAppendix

for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n(Recommendations)\n\nAs noted above, this section seeks to move beyond the \ndata  that  the  project  team  collected  in  Bangladesh,  \nIndonesia, and Pakistan to provide a set of more specific \nrecommendations for those who wish to design legal \nempowerment monitoring and evaluation initiatives in \nthe future. \n\nOf  paramount  importance,  particular  attention \nshould be paid to the significance of valid legal em-\npowerment indicators and the challenges associated \nwith the construction of such indicators across a wide \nrange of sector, community, and country contexts.\n\nMany legal empowerment monitoring and evalu-\nation initiatives begin with an emphasis on measuring \nthings like (i) increasing levels of satisfaction with a \nparticular  set  of  outcomes,  (ii) decreasing  levels  of \ndiscriminatory  decision  making  on  the  part  of  par-\nticular courts or tribunals, and (iii) increasing efforts \nto adopt humane sanctions on the part of particular \nadministrative and adjudicative agencies. In each case, \nimportant questions arise when it comes to interpret-\ning specific terms, such as satisfaction, discriminatory, \nand humane. While the normative underpinnings of \nthese terms may tend to be reasonably consistent in \nthe usage of major international agencies and donors, \nthe meaning and understanding of these terms will \nvary from context to context, depending on the inter-\npretive frameworks employed by local respondents. A \nsound and valid evaluation protocol must both define \nthese terms very precisely (within the context of the \nprotocol itself) and make each definition  known  to \nlocal respondents in a language that is, in some ways, \nalready their own.\n\nThose engaged in legal empowerment activities \nmust  remember  that  the  terms  of  empowerment \noften  vary  from  one  legal  context  to  the  next,  even \nwithin the same country. In Indonesia, for example, \nlegal empowerment initiatives routinely run up against \nthe  overlapping  terms  of  several  different  legal  sys-\n\ntems\u2014formal state laws, shari\u2019a (Islamic laws), adat \n(customary laws), and other examples\u2014each with its \nown legal terminology. For this reason, programming \nfocused on the question of legal empowerment must \nbe prepared to define its domain very carefully, always \nkeeping in mind that a case of empowerment in one \nlegal or quasi-legal domain may be seen as a case of \ndisempowerment in another.\n\nSo, when the project team asks whether a legal \nempowerment intervention has succeeded in enhanc-\ning a particular beneficiary\u2019s ability to claim or promote \ncertain rights, it must also be prepared to ask: what \nrights?\n\nThroughout  this  project,  the  focus  was  to  le-\ngally empower individual citizens, especially individual \nwomen and the poor. In light of the project\u2019s achieve-\nments, this aim was understandable and appropriate. \nAs the work drew to an end, however, the team be-\ncame increasingly aware of the fact that effective legal \nempowerment interventions that target local citizens \nmay in fact also rely on a prior set of legal empower-\nment  interventions  that  target  specific  members  of \nthe state. \n\nIn  fact,  the  project  team  repeatedly  found  that \nknowledgeable, confident, and ostensibly empowered \ncitizens (even elite citizens) were stopped short by inse-\ncure, defensive, and dismissive bureaucrats. Although \nthe citizens came to know about their rights during \nthe course of the pilot projects, the bureaucrats were \neither  completely\u2014and  genuinely\u2014unaware  of  the \nrights enjoyed by individual citizens or they stubbornly \npretended to be.\n\nThose with an interest in promoting the inclusion \nof  legal  empowerment  interventions  in  multilateral \ndevelopment  bank  loans  may  need  to  consider  ex-\npanding the scope of legal empowerment measures. \nThey may need to negotiate with local governments \nto  strike  a  more  effective  balance  between  (i) legal \nempowerment for local citizens, and, perhaps just as \nimportantly, (ii) legal empowerment for the functionar-\nies of the state itself. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \nStandard Survey Instrument\n\nThe following survey instrument was developed by the \nproject team for application in each of the three focal \ncountries, with adjustments required to indigenize the \nsurvey to the particular country and the Asian Develop-\nment Bank (ADB) host project\u2014Legal Empowerment for \nWomen and Disadvantaged Groups (6248\u2013REG). .\n\nSelection of Interviewees\n\nIn each pilot project location, the research team will in-\nterview 40\u2013\u00040 individuals selected at random. However, \nwithin  this  \u201crandom\u201d  sample,  the  team  will  work  to \nbalance the sample across three categories: (i) gender, \n(ii) income, and (iii) education. \n\nThese three categories should be addressed in the fol-\nlowing manner.\n\nIdeally, a \u00040/\u00040 male\u2013female split will emerge. However, \nin Pakistan and perhaps in Bangladesh, this may be very \ndifficult to achieve. To proceed with some consistency, \ntherefore, field researchers should try to interview \u0004\u0004% \nwomen in each field site (there are three field sites per \ncountry).\n\nGender\n\nIncome\n\nImagine a household income scale with six categories \n(a\u2013f).

These five interviews should include \nnot more than: \u0004 BKM members, \u0004 kalurahan member, \n\u0004 research team member, and \u0004 other.\n\nIn Bangladesh, these five interviews should include \nnot  more  than:  \u0004  male  WMCA  member,  \u0004  female \nWMCA  member,  \u0004  Union  Parishad  member,  and  \u0004 \nothers.\n\nIn Pakistan, these five interviews should include \nnot  more  than:  \u0004  HMC  members,  \u0004  union  council \nnazim,  \u0004  executive  district  officer  for  health,  and  \u0004 \nother.\n\nRecording Responses\n\nEach in-depth data recording sheet (each sheet is de-\nvoted to one of the five respondents) should include a \nquestion followed by three sets of blank spaces\u2014one \nfor the beginning stage of the research and one for the \nend. This will allow us to see how local strategies for \ntackling certain issues have changed over time.\n\nFor  example,  the  data  recording  sheet  for  the \nin-depth interviews conducted in Indonesia will look \nlike this:\n\nIndonesia/Kampung A/In-Depth Interviewee \n= (for example, BKM Member 1)\n\nQuestion 1: \nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response (June/July \u0004007):\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nQuestion 2, etc.: ________________________________\n_______________________________________________\n_______________________________________________\n\nGeneral Guidelines\nIn  general,  we  want  to  know  how  our  respondents \nchange over time. In particular, we want to know if, \nduring  the  course  of  the  pilot  project  (baseline/end), \nthey  become  \u201cempowered\u201d  in  terms  of  their  ability \nto  avail  themselves  of  the  rules,  regulations,  rights, \nresponsibilities, and opportunities associated with the \nADB loan. \n\nPractically  speaking,  this  involves  asking  them \nwhether (or not) they can navigate \u201cthe system\u201d envi-\nsioned in the ADB loan document. Are they inclined to \ntry to navigate this system? Did their inclination/urge \nto try grow over time? And, if they have tried (at any \npoint), what exactly did they do? Did the pilot project \nlead them to try any new things/strategies? And, finally, \ndid their efforts succeed?\n\nWith these basic questions in mind, the interview-\ners should remember that we are looking for specific \nempirical (interview-based) information regarding four \ndifferent  legal  empowerment  issues:  confidence, \nknowledge, actions/strategies, and outcomes. \n\nNOTE: These four legal empowerment issues are \nfeatured in the questionnaire (above) as well, so inter-\nviewers should always try to keep the basic concerns of \nthe questionnaire in mind. (In fact, the questionnaires \nand the \u201cethnographies\u201d are designed to probe similar \nquestions, \u2026 but the latter are designed to probe these \nquestions more deeply/within more detail\u2014for example, \nwith reference to specific examples, personal experienc-\nes, and anecdotes that provide a deeper understanding \nof topics addressed in the questionnaire).\n\nAs a general rule, it is acceptable to let your in-\ndepth conversations wander a bit. You want to provide \nthe interviewee with a chance to express himself/herself. \nHaving said this, however, the research team should \nalways feel free to push the interviewee for clarifica-\ntion\u2014especially when it comes to various contradic-\ntions. And of course, research team members should \nalways  try  to  keep  the  conversation  moving  along, \nrelatively smoothly, from one topic to the next.\n\nWhen contradictions arise, research team mem-\nbers  should  simply  indicate  that  \u201ctheir  own  under-\nstanding  (that  is,  the  researcher\u2019s  understanding) \nis  not  yet  complete.\u201d  In  other  words,  researchers \n\n\f108\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nshould humbly explain that \u201cthe interviewee has said \nsomething very interesting, but it\u2019s not yet clear what \nhe/she means. So, please, if the interviewee wouldn\u2019t \nmind,  could  he/she  please  explain  the  link  between \nStatement A and [contradictory] Statement B, so that \n[the  interviewer]  can  understand  exactly  what  the \ninterviewee really wants to say?\u201d\n\nThe in-depth interviews will proceed in three basic \nsteps. Below some preliminary ideas are provided to \nhelp the researchers frame their questions. \n\npressure? Is it related to the local administration\u2019s lack \nof responsiveness in the past? Does the weight of lo-\ncal tradition tie them down? Do they face resistance \nfrom  local  leaders\u2014for  example,  political  leaders  or \nreligious leaders?\u201d \n\n\u201cPlease tell me why many people lack the confi-\ndence to apply for changes, and please  provide me \nwith specific examples. Do you know anyone who feels \nthis type of hesitation or lack of confidence? Do you \nfeel this way yourself?\u201d\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe introduction should sound quite a lot like the intro-\nduction to the questionnaire. In addition, however, the \nresearchers should say a few words about the objectives \nof the ADB project. \n\nFor example:\n\n\u201cThe Asian Development Bank has started a project \nfocusing  on  [shelter/water/health].  And,  in  conjunc-\ntion with this, ADB wants to get a better idea of how \nlocal  people  think  about  local  problems  regarding \n[shelter/water/health], so that, in the future, ADB can \nbe  match  local  ideas  and  implement  their  projects \nmore effectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith  this  in  mind,  I\u2019d  like  to  ask  you  some \nquestions about local concerns involving [shelter/wa-\nter/health].  Remember,  there  are  no  right  or  wrong \nanswers.\u201d\n\nFollowing  this  brief  introduction,  the  research \nteam will carry on with specific questions. These could \nbe framed in the following manner.\n\nMeasuring Confidence\n\u201cSometimes,  people  face  problems,  or  they  want  to \nimprove something in their community, but they lack \nthe confidence to move forward. For example, they want \nto do or have X (NOTE: here, X involves an example \nclosely related to the concerns of the ADB project). But, \nsometimes, they feel that their ideas about X will not be \nappreciated, or perhaps they fear that they will simply \nwaste their time trying to participate in the process of \nmaking changes.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe  question  is:  Why  do  they  feel  this  type  of \nhesitation?  Why  do  they  feel  defeated  even  before \nthey begin? Is their lack of confidence a result of social \n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\n\u201cOkay. Thanks very much. That\u2019s very interesting. \n\u201cOf  course,  it\u2019s  also  true  that  some  people  do \nhave confidence. Some people do take action\u2014and \nnot only the rich and powerful, but also poor people \nand women. \n\n\u201cPlease  tell  me  about  your  community.  Do  you \nknow  about  any  exceptional  people  like  this?  Most \npeople can think of one or two examples. \n\n\u201cMy  questions  are:  Why  do  these  exceptional \npeople have more confidence? Do they have special \nconnections  that  give  them  confidence?  Is  their \nconfidence related to their education? Is it only men \nwho overcome these confidence barriers, or women \nalso?\n\n\u201cAgain, please tell me about your community. Do \nyou know anyone who has overcome these confidence \nbarriers? Perhaps you have overcome some of these \nbarriers  yourself.  Please  tell  me  about  some  specific \nexamples.\u201d\n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\n\fAppendix 4\n\n109\n\nMeasuring Strategies/Action\n\u201cThanks very much. That\u2019s very helpful.\u201d\n\nMeasuring Knowledge\n\u201cGreat. Thanks very much.\n\n\u201cWhen  people  want  to  get  things  done,  they \noften have two options. One option involves follow-\ning official rules. This strategy usually involves various \ntypes of forms and a certain amount of paperwork. \nThe other strategy is less bureaucratic; this strategy in-\nvolves using various friends\u2014various connections\u2014to \nget things done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI simply want to know how these two strategies \nwork in the context of your community\u2019s [shelter/wa-\nter/health] situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs  one  strategy  more  common  in  your  com-\nmunity? Is one strategy more common for men and \nanother strategy more common for women? Maybe \none strategy is more common for the poor and one \nis more common for the rich. Maybe both strategies \nsimply work together.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease give me one or two examples about these \nstrategies  in  the  context  of  [shelter/water/health]. \nWhich procedures do people follow? Which connec-\ntions do they use?\u201d\n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\n\u201cThanks. That\u2019s very interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow  imagine  a  situation  in  which  these  two \nstrategies are not working. In other words, after trying \nthem, the underlying problem remains unchanged.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do people usually respond? Do they quit or \ngive up? Do they protest? Do they call on local thugs \nor use threats? Do they file cases in court? Do they call \nfor negotiation/shalish, etc.? What do they do?\u201d\n\nAgain, please provide me with specific examples.\u201d \n\n\u201cHave  you  heard  about  the  project  that  I  men-\ntioned  at  the  beginning  of  this  interview\u2014the  one \nstarted  by  ADB  to  help  people  with  [shelter/water/\nhealth]?\n\nIf \u201cno, I have not heard about that project\u201d: Can \nyou tell me about some of the [shelter/water/health] \nproblems in this area and, maybe, how the situation \nhas grown better/worse during the last \u0004 years? \nAgain, do you have specific examples?\u201d\n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nIf \u201cyes, I have heard about the ADB project\u201d: \u201cDo you \nknow who is responsible for implementing this project \nin your area?\u201d (Hopefully, the respondent will men-\ntion the BKM/WMCA/HMC!)\n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\n\u201cDo you feel like you can participate in this project? Do \nyou feel like you have a role to play in this project? And, \nif so, what is your role?\u201d\n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\n\u201cDo you know about X (NOTE: Here, X should be some-\nthing  closely  related  to  the  rules,  regulations,  rights, \nresponsibilities, and opportunities that partner NGOs \n\n\f110\n\nLegal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\n\nwill be stressing in their workshops, outreach activities, \nand trainings)?\n\nIn the case of Indonesia, for example, the ques-\ntion could read: \u201cDo you know about the loans that \nthis project tries to make available for various home \nimprovements? (And, if so, do you know who is eligible \nfor these loans and how they get them?) Do you know \nanyone who has tried to obtain one of these loans? \n(And, if so, what happened when they tried?)\u201d\n\nIn the case of Bangladesh, the question could \nread: \u201cDo you know about the selection of construction \nlaborers for the local water system projects? (And, if \nso, do you know how the laborers are selected?) Do \nyou know anyone who has tried to get involved? (And, \nif so, what happened when they tried?)\u201d\n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\n\u201cDo  you  know  about  Y  (NOTE:  Here,  Y  is  similar  to \nX\u2014an  example  closely  related  to  the  project-specific \nrules and regulations that partner NGOs will be stressing \nin their workshops, outreach activities, and trainings)?\n\nBaseline Response: \n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Stage Response:\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n\n\fBibliography\n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \u0004999.

It gives people the knowledge, skills, and confidence to \nparticipate in development projects. It promotes inclusive growth, which reduces poverty by building people\u2019s \ncapacity to improve their lives. Inclusive growth is a goal of Strategy 2020, which guides the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in its mission to promote gender equality, empower women, and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nThe report presents the findings of a project funded by ADB, carried out by The Asia Foundation, and conducted \n\nin Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan. The project aimed to identify and test legal empowerment strategies that \nincrease access to basic social services, productive resources, and opportunities by women and other disadvantaged \ngroups and to incorporate legal empowerment initiatives into mainstream development projects.\n\nAbout The Asia Foundation \n\nThe Asia Foundation is a non-profit, non-governmental organization committed to the development of a peaceful, \nprosperous, just, and open Asia-Pacific region. The Foundation supports programs in Asia that help improve \ngovernance, law, and civil society; women's empowerment; economic reform and development; and international \nrelations. Drawing on more than 50 years of experience in Asia, the Foundation collaborates with private and public \npartners to support leadership and institutional development, exchanges, and policy research.\n\nWith a network of 17 offices throughout Asia, an office in Washington, DC, and its headquarters in San Francisco, \n\nthe Foundation addresses these issues on both a country and regional level. In 2007, the Foundation provided more \nthan $68 million in program support and distributed 974,000 books and educational materials valued at $33 million \nthroughout Asia.\n\nThe Asia Foundation is not an endowed organization, and depends solely on monetary contributions from donors \n\nto accomplish its work.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries \nsubstantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region's many successes, it \nremains home to two thirds of the world's poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million \nstruggling on less than $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its \n\ndeveloping member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical \nassistance.\n\nL\ne\ng\na\nl\n \nE\nm\np\no\nw\ne\nr\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \nf\no\nr\n \n\n \n\nW\no\nm\ne\nn\n \na\nn\nd\nD\ni\ns\na\nd\nv\na\nn\nt\na\ng\ne\nd\nG\nr\no\nu\np\ns\n\n \n\nThe Asia Foundation\n465 California Street, 9th Floor \nSan Francisco, California, USA 94104 \n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444\nFax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\ninformation@adb.org\n\nISBN 978-971-561-759-8\nPSN BBK219708\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nLegal \nEmpowerment \nfor Women and \nDisadvantaged \nGroups\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Legal Empowerment for Women  \nand Disadvantaged Groups\n", "FINAL REPORT\n", "Asian Development Bank.\n \nMandaluyong City, Phil.: Asian Development Bank, 2009.\n", "Legal empowerment for women and disadvantaged groups.\n", "1.
