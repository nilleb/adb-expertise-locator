The legislation and legal procedures are drafted in complicated legal language, making them unintelligible \nto nonlawyers. There are also many cases that demonstrate that the state often uses law as a tool to ensure the \nlegality of government authority rather than as means of protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens.\n\u2022 More cooperation is needed between civil society and government agencies. While collaborative efforts between \ngovernment reformers and civil society actors are gradually increasing, as evidenced by the successful passage of \nLaw No. \u0004\u0004/\u0004004 on the Elimination of Domestic Violence (enacted in September \u0004004), civil society organizations \nstill undertake the majority of legal empowerment initiatives.

In particular, laws about marriage and divorce, prop-\nerty, inheritance, finance, general and reproductive health, labor and social protection, violence against women, \nmigration, and human trafficking do not ensure women\u2019s rights are equal with men\u2019s rights. \n\u2022 The overlapping legal systems also erode women\u2019s rights. Under decentralized government, there is scope for \nlocal governments to advance public policies based on religious law, which might erode women\u2019s rights. The \nchallenge for women will be to press for a gender-sensitive interpretation of religious law.i \n\u2022 Violence against women is prevalent in Indonesia. Data collected by the National Commission on the Elimina-\ntion of Violence against Women indicate that in \u0004004 there were almost double the number of reported cases \nthan there were in \u000400\u0004. In \u000400\u0004, there were \u00040,\u00049\u0004 cases reported, which represented a \u00049% increase from \n\u0004004. Also, 80% of cases of violence result from domestic violence, and \u0004\u0004% of women in Indonesia experience \nviolence in the course of their lives.j\n\u2022 Corruption, cronyism, and poor governance are widespread in Indonesia, and have a particularly devastating \nimpact on women and other disadvantaged groups. Corruption has led to cases of illegal charging of rent; \naccepting bribes in relation to local land use decisions; and profiteering in relation to development projects, \nwhich leads to local populations being ignored or oppressed. \n\u2022 Decentralization of government power has not increased women\u2019s participation in governance. A number \nof challenges affect the quality of women\u2019s access and participation in local governance, including a lack of \nadequate women\u2019s representation in formal consultations convened by local legislatures, a revival of conserva-\ntive religious interpretations of gender roles, and a revival of gender insensitive or discriminatory religious or \ntraditional laws. \nLegal  General Activities\nEmpowerment \nActivities \u2022 Basic awareness-raising or legal literacy activities using: (i) print media (newspapers, posters, and pamphlets); \n(ii) electronic media (radio and television); and (iii) popular cultural performances such as music, street theater, \nand mobile cinemas.\n\u2022 Providing legal services to individual clients to help them with formal legal claims and informal dispute resolu-\ntion procedures.\n\u2022 Pursuing national legal reform by engaging in advocacy on government policy, including petitioning for the \ncreation of a legal services ombudsman, participating in legal or regulatory drafting at the national and local \nlevels, engaging in public interest litigation, undertaking media and advocacy campaigns, and lobbying law \nschools to run courses on clinical legal education and women and the law.\n\u2022 Helping establish active support services such as community counseling, shelters, community-based legal train-\ning, legal aid, and alternative dispute resolution (ADR). \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Activities\n\u2022 In \u000400\u0004\u2013\u000400\u0004, The Asia Foundation undertook the Indonesia Irrigation Sector Legal Empowerment Study with \nfinancial support from the Government of the Netherlands. The study aimed to develop a strategy and imple-\nmentation plan for a legal empowerment project to be included as a component of the planned Participatory \nIrrigation Sector Project.

The following common elements were reflected in each pilot project: (i) a grassroots \napproach,(ii) core focus on irrigation needs and priorities, (iii) attention to other community needs and priorities, \n(iv) attention to gender concerns, and (v) addressing common community concerns.

The commission and several local women\u2019s organization have publicly reported to \nthe international community the problem of violence against women in Indonesia. \n\u2022 The Women\u2019s Crisis Centre Bengkulu drafted a set of operating procedures for use by NGOs, hospitals, psy-\nchologists, crisis centers, the police, attorneys, social agencies and the Women\u2019s Empowerment Bureau when \ndealing with female victims of violence. \n\u2022 The Women\u2019s Network For National Legislation Program has supported civil society advocacy and policy dia-\nlogues on the anti-trafficking bill and provided technical assistance for parliamentary discussions of the anti-\ntrafficking bill. \n\u2022 NGOs, academics, the media, reform-minded local authorities, and donor agencies have played a key role in \nadvocating for the adoption of laws that require local governments and mining and forestry companies to \nobtain the free and prior informed consent of communities before harvesting natural resources. These reform \nefforts followed the \u0004999 Regional Autonomy Act, under which regional legislatures are free to enact their \nown provisions.\n\u2022 APIK Jakarta has conducted legal empowerment initiatives at the national and grassroots levels. Women who \nhave received legal assistance from APIK have formed taskforces through which they provide legal services to \nother members of their communities. \n\u2022 In \u0004000, Convention Watch Working Group supported a group of \u00044 flight attendants who filed a complaint \nagainst Garuda Indonesia Airlines regarding its requirement that women retire \u00040 years earlier than their male \ncounterparts. Convention Watch launched a media campaign highlighting the flight attendants\u2019 rights as women \nunder international law and their treatment as employees of Garuda. After \u0004 years of dispute with Garuda\u2019s \nBoard of Directors, the women brought the issue to the attention of the Minister of Women Empowerment, \nthe Minister of Manpower, the Minister of National Enterprises, and the National Parliament. The complaint \nwas settled in July \u000400\u0004, with the women being reinstated.\nUnderstanding  \u2022 ADB has found that most civil society groups in Indonesia adhere to legal empowerment strategies in spirit, if \nof Legal  not in strict terms.\nEmpowerment \nand Whether  \u2022 For example, Huma (a Jakarta-based organization) defines legal empowerment differently to ADB.

Most of the activities are rooted in the quantified assessment of initiatives carried out under \nand  given projects. \nEvaluation\n\u2022 Among smaller, community-based implementing organizations, monitoring and evaluation tools tend to be basic \nand primarily involve the quantification of basic services and outputs. Smaller and less sophisticated organizations \nfrequently lack the necessary training and resources to follow up on activities and outcomes in a systematic way. \nWhile the basic monitoring and evaluation systems and procedures followed by smaller providers are adequate \nfor generating quantitative reports on the number and nature of disputes that they handle, they typically lack \ndeeper bases of inquiry and analysis. Moreover, the basic systems and procedures followed offer little scope for \nfollow-up to ascertain whether agreements are honored.\n\u2022 Larger and better established organizations tend to have the greatest capacity to design and implement sophisti-\ncated monitoring and evaluation systems. Several legal empowerment organizations have begun to place greater \nemphasis on the quality and sophistication of their monitoring and evaluation tools. Some organizations have \ninvested in empirical baseline studies that serve as a basis for monitoring impact over time and/or help them \nidentify and refine program activities that target the needs and interests of beneficiary populations. \n\u2022 More sophisticated monitoring and evaluation measurements are needed to assess whether there have been \nadvances in the (i) collective strength and solidarity among members of beneficiary communities, (ii) confidence \nand self-esteem levels of women beneficiaries or minority populations, (iii) role and treatment of women in \ncommunity justice and decision making.\n\u2022 There is a greater need for better monitoring and evaluation measurements because the Government of Indo-\nnesia, civil society organizations, and donor agencies are now focusing more on implementing the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, national poverty reduction strategy, and pro-poor growth concepts. All parties need moni-\ntoring and evaluation systems that enable efficient information sharing, minimize their administrative burdens, \nand standardize key output and impact measures across projects and parties. The methodologies need to move \ntoward more sophisticated bases of inquiry that explore the relationship between legal empowerment, improved \ngovernance, and poverty reduction. \n\u2022 Implementing organizations are investing greater time, energy, and resources in developing better monitoring \nand evaluation methodologies. However, busy schedules and competing demands on their time provide few \nopportunities for them to share experiences and learn from one another, while donors in turn have few op-\nportunities to coordinate and share experiences and lessons learned.\nPakistan\nKey Issues Summary: Pakistan\nProgram   \u2022 Pakistan\u2019s political and economic power is highly centralized and held tightly by the feudal, industrial, bureau-\nEnvironment cratic, and military elite. These groups fight among each other to protect their own interests, meaning that the \npolitical process progresses unevenly. The resulting uncertainty has impeded the growth of democratic norms \nand the rule of law. \n\u2022 About \u0004\u0004% of the population lives below the poverty line, while almost \u00040% of the population lacks access to \nbasic needs and services such as clean water and health care. The education system is undeveloped. Women, \nminorities, the rural and urban poor, and other disadvantaged groups all lack social and economic safety nets \nand face severe social exclusion.k\n\u2022 The Government of Pakistan has prepared numerous policy documents promoting the rights of women and \ndisadvantaged citizens, including (i) the Medium-Term Development Framework \u000400\u0004\u2013\u00040\u00040, (ii) \u000400\u0004 Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper, (iii) \u000400\u0004 National Policy On Women, and (iv) \u0004997 National Plan of Action for Women. \nPakistan is also a party to treaties such as (i) CEDAW, (ii) United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, \nand (iii) International Labour Organization Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent \nCountries. Pakistan is obligated under these treaties to take measures necessary to ensure the protection and \npromotion of its citizens\u2019 rights. ", "62 Legal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\nKey Issues Summary: Pakistan\n\u2022 Pakistan is an amalgamation of various linguistic, ethnic, and cultural groups. Factors such as wealth, class, \nreligion, caste, tribe, and clan affect people\u2019s access to services and rights, and exclude large sections of the \npopulation from political and economic power. Women, minorities, and the urban and rural poor are particu-\nlarly disadvantaged. Generally, minority populations belong to the poorest sections of society and are further \ndisadvantaged by social biases, outdated laws, and\u2014for almost two decades\u2014an apartheid-like separate \nelectorate system. \n\u2022 While the Government of Pakistan has improved legal rights, women remain disempowered across all classes.l  \nPakistan is characterized by a rigid social system combined with entrenched patriarchal norms that violate \nwomen\u2019s basic human rights and deny them the right to an independent existence. About \u0004\u0004% of the female \nlabor force works in the informal sector and is consequently cut off from the minimal protection provided by \nlabor law. Affirmative action, however, has bolstered women\u2019s political representation, causing an increased \nfemale presence in all legislative assemblies.m \n\u2022 A weak judicial system is unable to provide effective access to justice to large sections of the population. More-\nover, traditional customs and practices commonly override statutory law and Islamic injunctions alike. \n\u2022 The cost of living has risen sharply, and the Pakistan rupee has devalued significantly. Such factors have further \nmarginalized disadvantaged groups, causing them to lose faith in the system. These factors have also contributed \nto growing intolerance, increased crime, sectarian and ethnic conflict, and the emergence and strengthening \nof militant religious groups and parties.\nIssues  \u2022 Daily life and the political area are dominated by corruption, nepotism, and oligarchy. Consequently, government \nAffecting the  institutions have been largely ineffective and unresponsive to the needs of a diverse population. \nRights and \nInterests of  \u2022 People have a poor understanding of their legal rights, and the judicial system does not actively protect the \nWomen and  rights of the poor, weak, women, or marginalized. \nDisadvantaged \nGroups \u2022 Many of the country\u2019s laws still discriminate against women and minorities. Many of these laws were enacted \nbetween \u0004977 and \u0004988. There are also serious gaps in labor laws, meaning that a large portion of workers \nhave no enforceable rights. Entrenched authoritarian patriarchal norms and structures prevent women and \nmarginalized communities from accessing legal rights, services, and resources. \n\u2022 People do not understand how to take action to protect their legal rights and have little faith in the system. \nAdditionally, there are very few avenues for formally protecting legal rights in rural areas, contributing to the \nongoing stronghold of informal dispute resolution forums. \n\u2022 The legal system is in need of urgent overhaul. Legal proceedings are plagued with (i) delay; (ii) a low ratio of \njudges to the population; (iii) a high number of frivolous claims; (iv) overcrowded, chaotic, and poorly maintained \njudicial facilities; (v) high costs; (vi) incompetent legal representation; and (vii) instances of maladministration \nin the courts. \n\u2022 Services and resources are not distributed equally between Pakistan\u2019s four provinces. About \u00040% of Pakistan\u2019s \npopulation lives in Punjab, which is the most urbanized of the provinces and has the best range of services. \nOutside of Punjab, service delivery and infrastructure is poor. There are frequent armed skirmishes in many rural \nareas. Local elites govern according to traditional norms that tend to suppress people\u2019s legal rights and main-\ntain unequal social structures. These structures maintain the status quo of inequitable ranks and the continued \nexclusion of vulnerable groups. The weaker elements of society thus have limited opportunity or space to effect \nchange and generally remain powerless. Weak state structures and the unwillingness of successive governments \nto change the status quo have created an environment of decay, exemplified by poor service delivery, nonre-\nsponsiveness, and the virtual nonperformance of different government institutions. \n\u2022 Men and those from majority or dominant tribes and higher castes have the best access to rights. Also, male \nheads of household, young men, male children, and older men and women commonly have more rights and \nentitlements at the household and community level than young women and female children. People from minority \nor less powerful ethnic groups and women are often deprived of even their most basic rights.", "Appendix 2 63\nKey Issues Summary: Pakistan\nLegal   \u2022 Several groups in Pakistan provide specific skills training on mediation, the transfer of knowledge, account \nEmpowerment   keeping, and report writing. \nActivities\n\u2022 Many groups produce a range of publications, such as newsletters and posters, that address a variety of sub-\njects. Groups are increasingly using theater productions to raise awareness on issues. The groups then provide \ninformation on resource groups that can assist with the different issues. \n\u2022 There is a trend toward running legal empowerment initiatives at the grassroots level. Several initiatives seek \nto create new public spaces by linking the political and civic arenas. An example of this trend is the use of local \ncitizens\u2019 action committees and peoples\u2019 assemblies as alternative forums for discussing issues, raising aware-\nness, and devising collective strategies to bring together political actors and citizens. \n\u2022 Many organizations are doing excellent work to provide people with information on how to access government \ninstitutions and programs. However, more work is needed to improve people\u2019s ability to access government \nservices and resources independently. Therefore, much of the current work cannot really be characterized as \nlegal empowerment activity. \n\u2022 Many government agencies also fail to qualify as legal empowerment initiatives. More programs are needed to \nprovide disadvantaged groups with support mechanisms (including legal assistance), enhance political repre-\nsentation, and improve governance and access to justice. \nKey Actors \u2022 Rozan is a civil society group working on issues of violence against women and sexual abuse.\n\u2022 The Interactive Resource Centre builds advocacy skills and consciousness about rights among marginalized sec-\ntions of society through the use of interactive theater. Apart from its own performances, it catalyses community \ngroups through rigorous training and backup. \n\u2022 The Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research was established in \u000498\u0004 by individuals from trade unions, \nacademia, and other professions to alleviate the powerlessness faced by workers. It conducts educational and \ntraining courses for workers from all over the country, including special programs for women workers. It also \nadvocates for workers\u2019 rights, holds seminars, facilitates dialogue, and promotes an understanding of rights \nand laws within the wider national and international context. Factory workers are also taught practical skills to \naid them in asserting and protecting their rights. \n\u2022 The Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation addresses the issues of women\u2019s lower status at the \nlegal, political, economic, and social levels. Its programs seek to overcome women\u2019s minimal participation in \ndecision-making processes and their lack of access to knowledge, resources, and institutions while simultane-\nously addressing the air of insensitivity regarding women\u2019s issues.\n\u2022 The Shirkat Gah\u2014Women\u2019s Resource Centre works to increase women\u2019s autonomy, promote gender equality, \nand actively cultivate democratic norms.\n\u2022 The Pirbhat Women Development Society seeks to address negative attitudes and practices toward women, \nspecifically attending to women\u2019s lack of education. \nGood Practice  Public\u2013Private Partnerships\nHighlights\n\u2022 Rozan runs the Rabta Police Training Project in conjunction with the National Police Training Academy. The \nproject seeks to address the growing trend of police violence. Also, modifying police behavior can have a sig-\nnificant impact on police treatment of women\u2019s complaints of abuse and violence. The project provides training \non self-growth, interpersonal communication skills, stress and anger management, attitudes and behaviors, \nviolence against women and children, and human rights. So far, 70 workshops have trained \u0004,\u000400 police from \nall of Pakistan\u2019s provinces. Evaluations and assessments conducted over a period of time demonstrated that \nwithin \u0004 months after completing training, police reverted to previous behavior. To combat this, Rozan altered \nits training program. The \u00040 days of training are now spread over a period of months. In January and February \n\u000400\u0004, Rozan ran a train-the-trainers session for \u0004\u0004 trainers and instructors from police schools and colleges \nthroughout Pakistan. This was designed to institutionalize learning and integrate their module into the regular \npolice education curriculum. ", "64 Legal Empowerment for Women and Disadvantaged Groups\nKey Issues Summary: Pakistan\nTransformative Theatre \n\u2022 The Interactive Resource Centre uses interactive theater to build advocacy skills and consciousness about rights \namong marginalized sections of society. By creating specific scenarios that resonate with the audience, interactive \ntheater enables people to relate dramatized scenes with their own experiences. These plays proactively invite \nthe audience to analyze the issues (which are presented from different angles), identify underlying causes and \npower dynamics, and formulate alternative solutions. The center has started airing its plays on cable television. \nIn Sheikhupura, the center used television to address access to water issues faced by the local community. It \nsurveyed the problem, videotaped separate discussions with the community and the local administration, and \nproduced a \u00040-minute video segment. This video segment was then shown to both the community and the \nadministration, allowing each side to view the issue from both perspectives. This enabled a meaningful dialogue \nto occur and eventually led to better maintenance of the water supply. The center had the video segment aired \non cable television, followed by a panel discussion. \nPolitical Education \n\u2022 The Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation has created a number of programs that are achieving \ngood results. Its Legislative Watch Program monitors the legislative and policy-making process and undertakes \nadvocacy interventions for legal and policy reform. Its Political Education Program aims to increase the knowledge \nbase of catalyst groups and women within political parties. The program places emphasis on constitutional \nrights, the legal framework, economic development, and the impact of policies on women. \n\u2022 Its Advocacy and Action Program works with citizen action committees to provide support structures for women\u2019s \nempowerment at the district level. As the Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation\u2019s programs are \nintegrated and linked across sectors, citizen action committee members are able to establish information network \ncenters as part of the Advocacy and Action Program. These centers now serve as gathering places for women \nto address common issues. The Advocacy and Action Program also supports groups to undertake advocacy \nand action on women\u2019s political and economic empowerment and violence against women. The program led \nto citizen action committees tackling a variety of issues. For example, the Kalat Citizen Action Committee in \nBalochistan vigorously resisted the tribal chiefs\u2019 decision to prohibit women from voting in the \u0004998 local elec-\ntion. Their campaign resulted in the chiefs reversing their decision, thereby enabling women voters to actively \nparticipate in the electoral process. \nStrengthening Workers\n\u2022 The Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research conducts educational and training courses for workers \nfrom all over the country. After unsuccessful attempts to jointly train men and women in \u0004999, it introduced \nspecial courses for women in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar. The modules for the women\u2019s courses have been \ntailored to address their particular needs and to motivate them to push for greater involvement in organizational \nactivities. Training participants include nurses, teachers, and members of other workers\u2019 associations, as well as \nsome workers from the informal sector. The program has trained nearly \u000400 women. \n\u2022 These training sessions have inspired a number of participants to form independent bodies, which attests to \nthe training program\u2019s success. Garment workers in Naushehro Feroze (Sindh) formed a body and organized \na week-long training course. In Quetta, Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research trainees formed \na society and organized a \u0004-day orientation with local resource persons. Training participants from Peshawar \nformed the Workers Education, Research, and Welfare Society. It has since organized several training seminars \nfor workers on national issues. It initially conducted the seminars with financial and technical support from the \nPakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research, and is now supported by the International Labour Organiza-\ntion. The society also ran a special \u0004-week workshop for \u0004\u0004 women workers dealing with the status of women \nand their problems, discriminatory laws, labor laws, and the women\u2019s movement.\nPromoting Legal Consciousness \n\u2022 The Shirkat Gah\u2014Women\u2019s Resource Centre runs the Women, Law, and Status Program that focuses on building \nthe capacity of community-based organizations. The program conducts a series of \u0004- or \u0004-day legal awareness \nworkshops. The sessions review local customs and practices and examine how the practices can discriminate\nagainst women and how they differ from women\u2019s enshrined legal rights. Under the program, Shirkat Gah \nruns a 4\u0004-day intensive paralegal training workshop. It also works with community-based organizations to \nshow them how they can build their capacity and strengthen their processes. It also educates trainers on how \nto communicate ideas. While the program has a small legal aid component, the main purpose of the training \nsessions is to show people how to assert their rights. Shirkat Gah also encourages paralegals to resolve matters \nthrough mediation and community-level intervention geared at addressing specific problems. ", "Appendix 2 65\nKey Issues Summary: Pakistan\nGrassroots Empowerment \n\u2022 Pirbhat Women Development Society regularly conducts workshops and seminars to sensitize the police and \nlegal practitioners about women\u2019s issues and concerns, and engages with the media to promote a better under-\nstanding of women\u2019s issues. Policy dialogues are held with members of both the Sindh Provincial Assembly and \nthe National Assembly. The sessions are well attended and highlight the society\u2019s political connectedness and \nstrong relationships with local governments and local communities. The group has started extending paralegal \ntraining locally and hopes to replicate Shirkat Gah\u2019s legal outreach program.\nUnderstanding  \u2022 Civil society groups have undertaken a significant number of initiatives to increase \u201cthe ability of women and \nof Legal  disadvantaged groups to use legal and administrative processes to access resources, services, and opportunities.\u201d \nEmpowerment  Some have a single focus such as a specific group of people or sector, while others are broader. \nand Whether \nthat  \u2022 Many legal empowerment initiatives are networked both in general coalitions and on issue-specific alliances, \nUnderstanding  such as water, dams, forests, women, or reproductive health.

There is a tendency to carry out results-based assessments \nEvaluation rather than process-oriented monitoring and evaluation. \n\u2022 A number of legal empowerment groups periodically review their own strategies and impact, leading to course \ncorrections through new activities, priorities, or areas of engagement. Some groups also periodically carry out \nstrategic planning exercises. \n\u2022 Virtually all of the legal empowerment initiatives monitor the legal and political environment for threats as well \nas opportunities\u2014which is indeed necessary to remain effective\u2014and for some, this is a major, if not principal, \nactivity.
