The  new  nature  of  the  crisis  calls  for  policy\nresponses entirely different from the conventional ones.\nThe  traditional  current-account  crisis  is  caused  by  the  deterioration  of\ndomestic macroeconomic performance, such as price inflation, fiscal deficits and low\nsaving rates.  For this type of crisis, conventional policies such as tight money, fiscal\nconsolidation,  structural  reforms,  and  output-  and  expenditure-switching  exchange\nrate policy are appropriate. However, economic performance of pre-crisis developing\nAsia  was  quite  good  as  measured  by  conventional  macroeconomic  variables.  The\ncritical question is: what consequences will result if the policy prescriptions for the\ntraditional current-account crisis are adopted against the Asian-type capital-account\ncrisis which hits even economies without serious macroeconomic imbalances.

Mounting non-performing\nloans and abrupt financial disintermediation play key roles in this process.

Introduction\nAsia\u2019s crisis that began with the floating of the Thai baht in July 1997 has\nbeen surprisingly harsh and persistent. What started as a typical currency crisis in a\nmedium-sized developing country continued to deepen as it spread to other countries\nand regions with extremely adverse real-sector consequences. Even as the initial shock\nwaves subsided and some financial and external indicators\u2014such as the exchange rate,\ninterest rates, net exports and inflation\u2014began to improve, declines in output and\nemployment continued in the crisis-ridden economies particularly in 1998. Countries\nthat were spared from the first round of contagion remained ever vulnerable. The crisis\nhas led to a call for a redesign of global financial architecture, as well as a need for the\nstrengthening of domestic financial markets.\nAs the World Bank report on private capital flows to developing countries\n(written before the eruption of the Asian crisis) clearly demonstrates, currency crises\nare not historically uncommon (World Bank 1997). However, the Asian crisis is unique\nin its severity, duration and contagion. Unlike other currency crises with only limited\nimpacts, it now threatens the stability of the international financial system. A large\nbulk of the literature on the Asian crisis is directed toward explaining its cause; but an\nequally intense inquiry should be made into why it developed into a major economic\ndisaster of this magnitude after it began.\nThe dimension of the Asian crisis cannot be gauged properly by the first-\ngeneration models of currency crisis that point to bad conventional macroeconomic\nfundamentals (say, unsustainable fiscal deficits) of individual countries as the main\ncause. Moreover, even though the second-generation models of currency crisis, which\nhighlight multiple equilibria, self-fulfilling attacks and herd behavior, may (partly)\nexplain its cause and contagion, they do not address the whole mechanism of this crisis\nincluding  its  depth  and  duration  (for  a  summary  of  first-  and  second-generation\nmodels, see the appendix).  Instead, we argue that a new theoretical perspective is\nneeded to diagnose, manage and prevent this type of systemic currency crisis.\n                                                  \n*We would like to thank the Monetary Policy Department and the Tokyo Office of the Bank of Korea for\nproviding us with valuable information, Stephen Parker and Kanit Sangsubhan for advising us on related\nissues, papers and conferences, and Kazuko Shirono for efficient research assistance. We are also grateful\nto Teerana Bhongmakapat and other participants at the ADB Institute seminar at the ADB headquarters\nin Manila, April 1999, for useful comments on the first draft of this paper.\n7", "The malignancy of the Asian crisis comes from its characteristics as twin\nfinancial crises. Externally, it is a \u201ccapital-account crisis\u201d (Yoshitomi 1998) driven by\nexcessive net private capital inflows relative to underlying current-account deficits,\nand further worsened by their composition dominated by short-term, foreign currency-\ndenominated loans. After a few to several years, the unsustainable lending boom comes\nto  an  end  as  asset  bubbles  burst,  excess  capacity  emerges  and  capital  flows  are\nreversed, leading to currency attacks which impose wrenching adjustments on the\nmacroeconomy (World Bank 1997). Internally, it is a banking crisis and associated\nsevere  credit  contraction.  Exacerbated  by  inappropriate  policy  responses,  initial\ncurrency and banking crises turn into an even more abrupt financial disintermediation\nin the banking sector, bringing production and investment to a halt. The two financial\nshocks reinforce each other as confidence plummets.1\nWhile  capital-account  crisis  and  credit  contraction  separately  are  by  no\nmeans new, their interaction on a regional scale was unheard of prior to the Asian\ncrisis. Even today, not all currency crises are of the Asian type. The Russian crisis in\nmid-1998  and  the  Brazilian  crisis  in  early  1999\u2014although  triggered  by  unstable\nmarket psychology in the aftermath of the Asian crisis\u2014belong to the traditional type,\ncaused mainly by unsustainable fiscal deficits. Even the 1994 Mexican crisis, which\nwas a \u201ccapital-account crisis\u201d by our definition, did not develop into a full-fledged\ndomestic credit contraction and was relatively short-lived.\nThis paper analyzes the twin financial crises that hit developing Asia in\n1997. Against the complications from a capital-account crisis and banking crisis-cum-\ncredit  contraction,  the  usual  prescription  for  fighting  a  budget-  or  inflation-driven\n\u201ccurrent-account  crisis\u201d,  consisting  of  macroeconomic  austerity  and  structural\nadjustments, is highly counterproductive as it worsens and perpetuates the crisis. In\nshort, the different nature of the crisis requires different policy responses. We propose\na new set of policies to cope with the new Asian-type systemic currency crisis.\nII. Capital-account Crisis\na. Definition and cause\nWe define the capital-account crisis as a series of severe macroeconomic\nadjustments forced, initially, by large inflows of private capital relative to underlying\ncurrent-account deficits dominated by short-term loans, then followed by their sudden\nand massive reversal. In terms of the balance-of-payments identity, such an adverse\nswing in private capital (which has its own dynamics\u2014see below) must be financed by\ninternational  aid,  a  change  in  foreign  reserves  or  an  improvement  in  the  current\naccount. In this type of crisis, it is the (private) capital account that drives the current\naccount and not vice versa. In the pre-crisis period, current-account deficits increased\n                                                  \n1 These situations (both capital-account crisis and credit contraction) are often described as a \u201cliquidity\ncrisis\u201d or \u201cfinancial panic\u201d with ambiguous and multiple meanings. For example, one official in an\ninternational body has used the term \u201cliquidity\u201d loosely and interchangeably as international reserves,\nmoney supply and domestic credit. Separately, the debate as to whether the Asian crisis contagion was\ndue to fundamental linkage or \u201cfinancial panic\u201d  does  not  address  the  interaction  between  external\ncurrency crisis and internal banking crisis, the main topic of this paper. Thus we prefer not to use either\nterm in defining the twin financial crises in order to avoid confusion.\n8", "as a result of excess capital-account surpluses. After the reversal, current-account\nsurpluses are generated by import contraction, which in turn is caused by financial\ndisintermediation and collapsing output (see below). Consequences on the real sector\nare very serious indeed.\nIn  addition  to  sheer  size,  the  composition  of  capital  inflows  contributed\nsignificantly to the ensuing difficulty in developing Asia, as already mentioned. The\naccelerated capital inflows into the region in the first half of the 1990s were not mainly\nin the traditional forms of official development aid, foreign direct investment or long-\nterm syndicated bank loans which are unlikely to reverse quickly. But rather, short-\nterm  bank  borrowing  constituted  the  largest  part  of  the  great  financial  boom,\nsupplemented  by  increased  investment  in  securities  markets.  Significantly,  these\nshort-term bank loans denominated mainly in US dollars were then converted into\nlocal currencies for long-term investment in real estate and manufacturing.  Not only\nare short-term lendings foot-loose, negotiations for their rollover or rescheduling are\ntechnically more difficult. Moreover, incurred foreign-currency denominated debt was\nlargely  unhedged.  This  double  mismatch\u2014i.e.,  mismatches  in  both  maturity  and\ncurrency\u2014made  the  balance  sheets  of  local  financial  institutions  and  enterprises\nextremely vulnerable to external shocks, including currency devaluation, a refusal of\nrollover by foreign investors and shortage of international reserves.\nReckless overborrowing by the private sectors of developing Asia in the pre-\ncrisis period is well corroborated by data (see below), yet the underlying cause of the\noverborrowing is still hotly debated. Even if we confine ourselves to financial aspects,\nthere is a view that points to policy mismanagement of the crisis-countries themselves,\nespecially the simultaneous maintenance of a fixed exchange rate and substantial\ninternational interest differentials. However, pre-crisis Asia was not on a rigid dollar\npeg as most countries in fact adjusted their dollar rates from time to time. Statistically,\nthere is no correlation between pre-crisis rigidity or overvaluation of the domestic\ncurrency and the severity of subsequent currency attacks (Ohno 1999).2\nDeveloping and transitional economies often face capital-account crises in\nthe process of global financial integration. Especially in the post-Cold War period, the\nvirtues of economic liberalization and external financial opening has been preached to\nlatecomer  countries  with  increasing  pressure.  The  policymakers  in  these  countries\nhave  been  strongly  advised  by  an  international  financial  institution  consensus  to\nquickly import \u201cinternational best practices\u201d and integrate with the global economy.\nBut institutional reforms for transparency, accountability, corporate governance and so\non take time, while major exchange rates and international financial markets remain\nhighly  volatile.  Premature  and  mismanaged  financial  integration  will  lead  to\noverborrowing  with  unwarranted  exuberance  until  the  bubble  crashes  inevitably,\nbringing real and financial disasters (Stiglitz 1999, World Bank 1997). This points to\nthe critical issue of sequencing among domestic financial liberalization, institutional\nbuilding and reforms, and capital-account convertibility. Furthermore, some find more\nfault with the overall design of the international financial system, rather than policies\nand institutions of individual countries, whose improvements are welcome but do not\nnecessarily guarantee immunity from future crises.3\n                                                  \n2 Only Thailand, where the crisis started, might be \"duly blamed\" for purposely attracting foreign bank\nloans through \u201coff-shore\u201d financial markets. But subsequent contagion into the rest of Asia and the world\ncannot be explained by this line of logic.\n3 As Stiglitz (1999) puts it graphically: \u201cIf there were a single accident on a road, it is reasonable to blame\n9", "Superimposed  on  this  debate  is  the  question  of  \u201cmoral  hazard\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nexcessive risk taking prompted by the existence of an insurance mechanism\u2014that\naggravates overborrowing. Despite its theoretical appeal, however, practical relevance\nof moral hazard as the primary cause of currency crises is yet to be demonstrated\nempirically. In Thailand, for example, the government\u2019s decision to close one big bank\nand  several  non-banks  in  the  early  1980s  did  not  prevent  the  emergence  of\noverborrowing a decade later.4\nHowever, the cause of initial overborrowing will not be discussed further in\nthis paper. As our primary objective is to show how the Asian crisis got worse after it\nstarted.\nb. Distinguishing capital-account crisis from current-account crisis\nLet us denote the balance of payments identity as follows:\n(1)  CA + KA  + KA  + EO =\u00c4 IR\np o\nwhere\nCA : current account\nKA  : private capital account\np\nKA  : official capital account\no\nEO : errors and omissions (which contain unrecorded private financial flows)\n\u00c4 IR : change in international reserves\nThis can be rewritten as\n(2) CA = - KA  -  KA  +\u00c4 IR -  EO\np o\nor, alternatively,\n(3) KA  = - CA -  KA  +\u00c4 IR -  EO\np o\nAn identity by itself does not prove causality. But using the identity, we can\nclarify the difference between the capital-account crisis and the traditional current-\naccount crisis. In each of equations (2) and (3), the left-hand side variable is assumed to\nchange  first  while  the  right-hand  side  variables  adjust  in  order  to  finance  this\n\u201cautonomous\u201d  shock  (let  us  ignore  EO  which  is  not  important  in  our  theoretical\ndiscussion and can be considered as part of KA  for practical purposes).\np\nLet us begin with the traditional current-account crisis, which is simpler.\nUsing equation (2), the problem can be described as follows. Due to macroeconomic\n                                                                                                                                                           \nthe driver. If however, there were dozens of accidents at the same curve in the road, one should at least\nask whether the road needs to be redesigned.\u201d (p.6)\n4 Another important question is whose moral hazard? The problem can occur on many levels, for example:\n(i) governments lose policy discipline because of rescues headed by the IMF; (ii) international private\ninvestors overlend for the same reason; (iii) bank managers become careless due to government protection;\n(iv) borrowing enterprises similarly misbehave; and (v) depositors become risk-insensitive because of a\ndeposit insurance system. For meaningful discussions, relative importance of each type of moral hazard\nmust be identified.\n10", "policy slippage (i.e., large budget deficits and high inflation), the domestic economy\noverspends its income. The amount of overspending in excess of domestic production is\nequal to \u2013CA by the well-known national income identity. This can be financed if\nprivate capital inflows (KA ) are strong, but that is unlikely in an economy with weak\np\npolicy  discipline.  As  usable  international  reserves  (IR)  dwindle,  the  balance  of\npayments looks increasingly unsustainable. The country faced with the prospect of\ndefault rushes to the International Monetary Fund. The Fund\u2014sometimes with other\nbilateral  and  multilateral  donors\u2014provides  emergency  funds  in  return  for  the\nimplementation  of  corrective  measures.  These  include  macroeconomic  stabilization\naimed at restraining domestic expenditure, as well as expenditure- and production-\nswitching policy and structural adjustment designed to strengthen supply capacity.\nExchange rate devaluation may be needed to enhance these adjustments. While details\ncan be mismanaged and other important factors can be missed, overall, the Fund\u2019s\npolicy prescription is correct and necessary for this type of crisis.\nc. Four stages of the capital-account crisis\nBy contrast, the capital-account crisis is driven in equation (3) by an increase\nin KA  which subsequently collapses. As it does so, the impact is absorbed by (i)\np\ncurrent account, (ii) official capital inflows, (iii) changes in international reserves\u2014or a\ncombination thereof. More concretely, the typical Asian crisis story ran as follows\n(Table 1).\nStage  1:  Overborrowing  begins:  as  an  economy  is  opened  up  financially,\ninvestors\u2019 herd behavior, possibly aggravated by the moral hazard problem, causes\nprivate capital to flow in excessively. As a result of too much capital inflow exceeding\nthe underlying current-account deficit, a surplus in the overall balance of payments\nemerges. This causes international reserves to accumulate,5 expands monetary and\ndomestic  credit  aggregates,  and  ignites  a  domestic  economic  boom.  Due  to  the\nincreased domestic absorption compared with domestic production, the current account\nbegins to deteriorate (but not necessarily to the extent of fully offsetting the incoming\ncapital, i.e., KA  > - CA > 0).\np\nStage 2: Increasing vulnerability: while the current-account deficit widens\nincreasingly to match the capital-account surplus, continued overborrowing and over-\nabsorption reach their limits. Excess capacity and asset bubbles in stock and real\nestate become apparently inconsistent with the underlying fundamentals, raising the\nprobability of a crash (oftentimes the bubbles burst prior to currency attacks, as in\nThailand in 1995-96). Furthermore, the ballooning current-account deficit raises doubt\nabout its sustainability and concern for the loss of competitiveness.6 These are the\n                                                  \n5 In theory, if the domestic currency is on a pure float without government intervention, capital inflows\ncause appreciation rather than accumulation of reserves. That would partially or fully offset the incipient\neconomic boom. But in reality, very few developing economies can adopt a pure float because of possible\nvolatility of the exchange rate and the shallowness of the domestic financial market. Those in Asia all\nmanaged their currencies to varying degrees. Thus, the sequence of events described in the text reflects\nreality.\n6 In the capital-account crisis, deterioration of the current account in the pre-crisis period is the result of\nexcessive capital inflows, and not the cause of the crisis. However, market observers often mistake it for\nthe sign of weak fiscal discipline or a loss of international competitiveness. Although their inference is\nincorrect, this perception nonetheless contributes to the decline of overall confidence. In the most seriously\naffected Asian economies, fiscal imbalance was not a problem, and there is also no evidence of significant\nexchange rate overvaluation (Ohno 1999).\n11", "trigger  mechanisms  for  twin  financial  crises  (i.e.,  currency  and  banking  crises).\nCurrency and maturity mismatches make the balance sheets of domestic financial\ninstitutions and enterprises highly vulnerable to the combined effect of deterioration of\nthe assets, depreciation of exchange rate, and a refusal of rollover by foreign creditors\n(see above; also McKinnon 1999). Seeing all this, foreigners begin to repatriate their\ninvestments and residents begin to shift their savings abroad. The capital-account\nsurplus starts to decline and then turns into deficit, resulting in an overall-balance-of-\npayments deficit, given the increased current-account deficit. The country is forced to\ndefend the exchange rate by intervention, but leading to the loss of international\nreserves.\nStage 3: Reversal: after probing attacks or as a result of crisis contagion,\nmarket psychology collectively turns negative and a currency attack finally succeeds.\nCountries differ as to how long they hold on to their exchange rates (and how much\nreserves they are prepared to lose) before they let them float. As the exchange rate\ndepreciates, the balance sheets of financial institutions and enterprises with unhedged\nforeign-currency debt are seriously damaged; currency and banking crisis reinforce\neach other through this balance-sheet effect. As confidence evaporates, panic spreads\nand  real-sector  activities\u2014such  as  international  trade,  merchandise  distribution,\nproduction and investment\u2014are impeded.  Real GDP begins to decline and domestic\nfinancial crisis deepens.\nStage 4: International rescue: where the international community led by the\nIMF provides emergency financing and simultaneously imposes policy conditionality.\nWhile new private lending is hardly available, bilateral and multilateral official inflows\n(whose disbursements were rather slow in Asia) as well as private debt workouts\npartly ameliorate the balance-of-payments pressure, permitting the rebuilding of lost\ninternational  reserves.  Because  of  the  suddenness  and  massiveness  of  the  capital\nreversal, the amount of money required to replenish international reserves under the\ncapital-account crisis is far greater than in the case of the traditional current-account\ncrisis (which can usually be financed within the prescribed limits of IMF lending for\neach member country). At the same time, domestic financial crisis reduces business\ninvestment and shakes consumer confidence, resulting in a sharp decline in domestic\ndemand. Credit risks rise drastically due to increasing defaults. Thus, the capital-\naccount crisis simultaneously causes domestic financial crisis, defaults, and contraction\nof  domestic  absorption.  Under  such  circumstances,  adoption  of  macroeconomic\nausterity and bold financial and enterprise restructuring designed for the traditional\ncurrent-account crisis will further aggravate both domestic financial crisis and demand\ncontraction.  Their  adverse  impacts  on  credit  contraction  and  output  implosion  are\nlikely to persist long after calm is restored in the currency market (see section III). The\nresulting collapse in imports and improvement in the current account should not be\nmisconstrued as a positive development, as they are signaling a complete breakdown of\nthe financial and real sectors of that economy.\nThis sequence of events is highly stylized and gives only a rough picture of\nthe crisis which unfolded in developing Asia in recent years. To make it more precise,\npeculiarities of individual countries must be added or subtracted. But we believe that\nthis broad view more appropriately captures the essence of what has happened than\nthe  alternative  views  emphasizing  macroeconomic  policy  mistakes  of  individual\ncountries, exchange-rate misalignments, large current-account deficits, weak financial\ninstitutions  and  monitoring,  or  even  the  recent  literature  on  crisis  contagion  and\n12", "financial panic (which does not recognize the double financial nature of the present\ncrisis).\nMost observers including the IMF (1999)\u2014see section IV\u2014now recognize this\nprivate capital-driven nature of the Asian crisis, although some may prefer different\nnames for what we call the capital-account crisis (say, the \u201c21st century-type\u201d crisis).\nBut the central problem is that this recognition is still not reflected in the design of\npolicy prescription and conditionality. Macroeconomic belt-tightening and \u201cstructural\nadjustments\u201d  which  are  good  only  for  traditional  current-account  crises  are\nrecommended  to  the  economies  mired  in  capital-account  crises.  This  gap  between\ndiagnosis and prescription is baffling. This important point will be revisited in the\nsubsequent sections of this paper.\nd. Balance-of-payments development\nTable 2 shows the combined annual balance of payments of the five Asian\ncrisis  economies  (Thailand,  Korea,  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  the  Philippines).\nAggregation  cancels  out  idiosyncrasies  and  thus  is  more  suitable  for  proving  our\ngeneral point.7 During 1994-96 corresponding to stages 1 and 2 above, private capital\ninflows accelerated from 40.5 billion dollars in 1994 to 103.2 billion dollars in 1996.\nCommercial  banks  and  nonbanks  were  mainly  responsible  for  the  large  inflows\nalthough equity investment also increased. Consolidated current-account deficits were\nalso on the rise, from 24.6 billion dollars in 1994 to 54.6 billion dollars in 1996, but\nthey were smaller than the private capital inflows. As a result of stronger inflows and\nupward pressure on the domestic currencies, international reserves were built up at an\nincreasing speed.\nBut the tide turned in mid 1997 (stage 3). Annual data are too crude to closely\ntrace the unfolding process of the crisis, and at any rate currency collapses were not\nsimultaneous  across  the  five  economies.  Nonetheless,  from  1996  to  1997,  private\ncapital flows plummeted from 103.2 to minus 1.1, or by 104.3 billion dollars. This\nviolent reversal amounted to 9.2 percent of their combined GDP.8 It was financed in\n1997 by reserve losses of 51.8 billion dollars (50 percent of total change), an increase in\nofficial inflows by 32.5 billion dollars (31 percent) and a reduction of current-account\ndeficits by 28.3 billion dollars (27 percent)\u2014these figures are calculated relative to\n1996. The rest is accounted for by a small change in errors and omissions.\nHowever, that is not the end of the story (stage 4). In 1998 foreign reserves\nwere greatly increased due to international help as well as contraction of net imports.\nAlthough private capital continued to leave the region, it was almost completely offset\nby  official  inflows  so  that  the  capital  account  was  balanced.  Unfortunately,  this\n                                                  \n7 The Institute for International Finance\u2019s capital-account data for individual countries are confidential\nand cannot be disclosed here, but each of the five shows the pattern of capital-account crisis described in\nthe text and Table 1 with only minor deviations. For example, the peaking of private capital inflow into\nThailand occurred in 1995 rather than 1996. In Malaysia, reserve increase was recorded in 1996 but not in\n1994 or 1995. But otherwise, the sequence of aggregated events is also true for individual economies.\n8 Individually, between 1996 and 1997 the reversal in private capital flows in percentage of 1996 GDP was\nas follows: Korea (10.5 percent), Thailand (7.9 percent), Indonesia (5.4 percent), Malaysia (11.3 percent),\nPhilippines (10.4 percent). However, the reversal was much larger if country-specific periods from peak to\nbottom are chosen: for example, Thailand (16.7 percent from 1995 to 1998) and Indonesia (13.4 percent\nfrom 1996 to 1998). These are calculated as inflow in 1998 minus that in 1995 (or 1996), in percent of 1996\nGDP.\n13", "situation  was  achieved  by  an  enormous  \u201cimprovement\u201d  in  the  combined  current\naccount from a deficit of 26.3 billion dollars in 1997 to a surplus of 58.5 billion dollars\nin 1998, or by 84.8 billion dollars. This did not happen through export expansion\nsupported by increased competitiveness and market access; rather, import compression\nwhich outpaced declining exports9 was the cause. Imports were compressed initially by\na sudden withdrawal of letter-of-credit facilities due to immediate impact of domestic\nfinancial  crisis.  Later,  import  contraction  continued  due  to  collapsing  domestic\ndemand.\nGiven the speed and magnitude of the reversal of capital flows, the real\nsector cannot adjust so quickly through the normal price mechanism. Evaporation of\ntrade credits and collapsing domestic demand were the quantitative mechanisms to\nbrutally force the needed change in the current account. This is hardly a desirable\nadjustment; in fact it is an entirely new and very serious problem. According to the IIF\nforecast, basically the same situation appears to prevail in 1999.\nIII. Credit Contraction\na. Old cures that kill patients suffering from new disease\nThe recognition of the present Asian difficulty as a capital-account crisis goes\na long way to explain its severity. But unlike the 1994 Mexican crisis, the Asian crisis\nhas been further aggravated and prolonged by the very policies that were supposed to\nend it. As argued above, the vital mistake was made when policy prescriptions for\ncurrent-account crisis was applied to this capital-account crisis. At that point, the\ncapital-account crisis became a full-fledged domestic financial and real economic crisis.\nAs capital controls were lifted without a proper monitoring or regulatory\nmechanism, free-wheeling overseas borrowing by domestic enterprises and financial\ninstitutions  in  the  region  ensued  (assisted  by  equally  eager  lenders  and  investors\nabroad), which made them highly indebted in short-term, hard-currency denominated\ndebt. However, their assets were largely long-term and domestic currency-denominated\ninvestments in local factories, real estate and the like (often of dubious quality). As\nmentioned earlier, these currency and maturity mismatches made them extremely\nvulnerable to external financial shocks.\nCompared  with  other  regions,  high-performing  Asian  economies  were\ncharacterized by heavy reliance on indirect finance and high debt-to-equity ratios in\nenterprise finance (Wade 1998a&b). As steep depreciations of the Asian currencies\nbegan in 1997, balance sheets of enterprises and financial institutions were eroded\nimmediately.  This  alone  was  enough  to  seriously  impair  the  capacity  of  domestic\nfinancial institutions to provide credit for production, investment and international\ntrade. Furthermore, the bursting of bubbles and excess capacity were rapidly eroding\nthe asset side of their balance sheets. But given such inherent credit contraction and\ndomestic demand decline caused by the twin financial crises, the situation was made\nmuch worse by the conventional policies adopted by the governments (often nudged by\nthe IMF and international creditors), as argued above. In a state of financial turmoil,\nthe following measures contributed to the acceleration of financial disintermediation\n                                                  \n9 In developing Asia export receipt declined mainly because of lower prices even though the quantity of\nexports was robust.\n14", "and credit contraction (also see Wade 1998a&b, Werner 1998):\n(i)  fiscal and monetary tightening which lowered aggregate demand;\n(ii)  high interest rate policy intended to stop the falling currency, which however\nfurther aggravated domestic financial crises by damaging the capital positions\nof highly indebted enterprises and financial institutions;\n(iii)  requiring banks to achieve capital adequacy standards in the atmosphere of\ncrisis, which prompted them to further cut back on enterprise loans;\n(iv)  sudden closure of bad financial institutions without protecting depositors and\nborrowing enterprises; and\n(v)  inability to stem the free fall of currencies for an extended period, which let\nthe  twin  financial  crises  to  deteriorate  further  through  the  balance-sheet\neffect.\nWith regard to point (ii) above, it is often argued that high interest rates are\nnecessary\u2014at least temporarily\u2014to attract back scared domestic and foreign investors\nand that there is no other effective way to stop a falling currency (IMF 1999). However,\nas Ito (1999) and Wade (1998b) point out, there have been no convincing models or\nevidence  to  support  this  crucial  claim.  True,  together  with  foreign  exchange\nintervention, raising interest rates is a standard measure to defend a currency from\nspeculative attacks. But after the attack succeeds and the currency begins to fall,\nwould it also be an effective measure to restore confidence in an economy with heavy\nreliance on bank loans and high debt-to-equity ratios? If external loss of confidence is\nintricately linked with domestic bad debt and financial disintermediation (as in the\ncase of Asia\u2019s crisis countries\u2014see below), high interest rates which hurt the balance\nsheets further are more likely to keep potential investors away.\nMore generally, there are two goals to be pursued under twin financial crises,\ni.e., mitigating currency crisis (external) and financial crisis (internal). For this, at\nleast two sets of policy instruments are required. For international liquidity crisis,\nspecial provision of usable funds, maintenance of exposure by foreign investors, etc. are\nneeded. For domestic financial crisis, provision of domestic liquidity is appropriate (for\nmore concrete proposals, see section V). Just one policy instrument\u2014interest rates\u2014\ncannot be assigned to both targets.\nb. The case of Korea10\nIt should be underlined that credit contraction and associated real-sector\ndifficulties  emerged  with  a  vengeance  after  foreign  exchange  markets  began  to\nstabilize,  around  early  1998.  For  example,  an  acute  investor  panic  over  Korea\u2019s\ninternational \u201cliquidity\u201d crisis came more or less to an end on December 24, 1997 when\nthe IMF and G7 countries requested foreign private creditors to accept a rollover. The\nnewly-elected  president,  Kim  Dae  Jung,  also  made  it  clear  that  necessary  reform\nmeasures would be implemented with resolve. However, the real Korean crisis\u2014in\nterms of output and employment losses\u2014started to unfold in the spring of 1998.\nIn the early stage of the currency crisis, the Bank of Korea employed a high\n                                                  \n10 Credit contraction is also reported widely in Thailand and Indonesia. For example, in Thailand\noutstanding commercial bank lending declined 12.2 percent between January 1998 and January 1999.\nUnlike  Korea,  however,  the  authors  are  so  far  unable  to  collect  statistical  data  on  bank  loans\ndisaggregated by use, industry, region, etc. in these countries.\n15", "interest rate policy under the agreement with the IMF in order to quickly stabilize the\nexchange rate amid the country\u2019s crumbling credibility. But this policy caused some\nsignificant side effects, including severe credit crunch. The combination of high interest\nrates and the Bank for International Settlements capital adequacy requirement made\nKorean banks more reluctant than ever to extend loans.11\nFigure 1 shows the production trends of manufacturing in Korea. A large dip\nin  January  1998  corresponds  to  the  initial  currency  crisis  but  the  index  failed  to\nrecover for many subsequent months. As for small-scale manufacturing, the downward\ntrend continued throughout 1998. While data for credit allocation by enterprise size do\nnot exist, given this output trend it is likely that small- and medium-sized enterprises\nwere  the  main  target  for  credit  withdrawal.  Amid  the  credit  crunch,  large\ncorporations\u2014especially  the  five  largest  chaebols\u2014could  raise  funds  by  issuing\ncommercial  paper  and  corporate  bonds,  but  smaller  enterprises  which  had  relied\nmainly  on  bank  financing  suffered  greatly.  This,  together  with  labor-shedding  at\nvirtually all enterprises regardless of size, contributed to an unemployment rate which\nshot up to an historical high of 7.6 percent in July 1998 and remained high thereafter\n(Figure 2).\nAs is clear from Figure 3, severe credit contraction began in the spring of\n1998. Financial institutions curtailed loans for the normal operation of enterprises\n(which  account  for  the  bulk  of  bank  and  nonbank  loans)  rather  than  for  capital\ninvestment. This move was accompanied by a marked reduction in the loan-to-deposit\nratio which continued up to October 1998 (Figure 4).\nHowever, words of caution are in order in interpreting Figure 3. Part of the\ndecline  in  bank  loans  for  business  operation  in  1998  was  due  to  redemption  of\noverdrafts by large corporations in their effort to compress debt-equity ratios. Thus not\nall  decline  can  be  attributed  to  involuntary  credit  contraction  imposed  on  small\nenterprises. On the other hand, bank loans for investment remained flat during 1998,\nbut this includes new policy loans in the amount of 3.4 trillion won extended by the\nKorea Long Term Credit Bank (KLTCB). If this is excluded, bank loans for investment\nactually decreased during the year.12\nFigure 5 shows the impact of financial disintermediation by industry from\nSeptember 1997 to September 1998. The average credit contraction was 9.3 percent.\nConstruction, trade, mining, manufacturing and household loans were most seriously\nhit. Within manufacturing, Figure 6 shows the distribution of impact across different\nindustries. Similarly, Figure 7 shows its regional distribution. It should be noted that\nmajor cities located in the northwest-southeast industrial corridor, such as Pusan,\nDaejeon, Ulsan and Daegu, suffered severely. The situation in Seoul and its vicinity\nwas close to the national average. By contrast, less industrialized regions were spared\nfrom the direct impact of credit contraction. It should be noted, however, that these\nregional differences do not necessarily translate into micro-level conditions. Depending\non industry and size, even enterprises in lightly-hit areas were experiencing systemic\nfinancial difficulties.\n                                                  \n11 This paragraph reflects information provided by the Monetary Policy Department of the Bank of Korea.\n12 Information in this paragraph is supplied by the Monetary Policy Department of the Bank of Korea. The\nKLTCB, a development bank, was merged into Kookmin Bank in December 1998. Since then, it has been\nre-classified as a deposit money bank.\n16", "In addition to the KLTCB loans mentioned above, the Korean authorities\nhave  responded  to  the  situation  in  the  following  ways.  First,  interest  rates  were\nlowered gradually in 1998 insofar as this did not conflict with maintaining stability in\nthe foreign exchange market. Second, in an attempt to encourage banks to extend loans\nto small- and medium-sized enterprises, the aggregate credit ceiling was raised and\nlending  rates  were  reduced.  Third,  the  Credit  Guarantee  Fund  was  replenished\nthrough the budget. Fourth, public money was injected into banks to help raise their\ncapital ratios. As a result of these policies, the Bank of Korea believes the worst credit\ncrunch was over by early 1999; loans picked up in most regions during the fourth\nquarter of 1998 and this trend is expected to continue in 1999.13\nc. Credit crunch controversy\nUp to now, credit contraction has been a relatively neglected area of research\nboth theoretically and empirically, and even basic questions remain unanswered.\nForemost among such questions is an empirical one: is (was) there a credit\ncrunch  in  the  Asian  crisis-countries?  Recent  enterprise  surveys  conducted  by  the\ngovernments of the five Asian crisis countries in collaboration with the World Bank\ngive us a glimpse of the problem of identification (see Waiquamdee et al. (1999) for\nsummary; also see reports on individual countries). These surveys were conducted\nbetween November 1998 and February 1999 and covered 3,710 firms of various sizes\nand foreign market access in five manufacturing industries. Inadequate liquidity was\nreported by 37.9 percent of the respondents (see Table 3). Thailand reported the largest\nproportion of firms in short liquidity (56.8 percent) followed by Korea (48.2 percent)\nand Indonesia (34.8 percent). In addition, high interest rates were perceived to have\ncontributed to the decline in capacity utilization by 48.9 percent of the firms, with\nthose in the Philippines (55.5 percent), Thailand (53.7 percent) and Indonesia (51.3\npercent) reporting the highest ratios.\nWe  consider  this  as  a  rather  clean  prima  facie  evidence  that  credit\ncontraction is a very serious problem. Curiously, however, from this the authors of the\nsummary report (Waiquamdee et al. 1999) conclude that firms experiencing illiquidity\n\u201csurprisingly amounted to only 37.9 percent of all firms\u201d (p.8); \u201cinadequate liquidity\nwas not generally perceived to be a major problem\u201d and \u201cit cannot be confirmed that\nthere was technically a credit crunch\u201d (p.20). They cite weak domestic demand as the\nprimary  cause  of  the  present  difficulty  (67.9  percent  of  the  respondents  say  it  is\nsignificant).\nAside from possible sampling biases noted by the conference attendees in\nBangkok,14 interpretation of the results by these authors is highly problematic. Unlike\ninflation or weak demand which have more general impacts, credit contraction is an\nuneven phenomenon. It cannot be considered minor because only a fraction of firms are\naffected (would an unemployment rate of 20 percent be insignificant since a majority of\nworkers are on the payroll?). Moreover, weak domestic demand may be a (lingering)\nconsequence of credit crunch which depresses demand through financial linkages and\n                                                  \n13 Based on information by the Bank of Korea as of April 7, 1999.\n14 Selection of a limited number of manufacturing industries may have missed the hardships faced by\nother industries such as construction, trade and services. Also, a rather late survey date means that (i) the\nworst was already over; (ii) only surviving firms were surveyed (\u201cwinners bias\u201d); and (iii) policy loans\nsignificantly offset the shortage of private credit.\n17", "consumer and investor psychology. Moreover, to be useful, an indicator of credit crunch\nrequires time dimension (as in our Figures 1-7) since some firms may have been\nwithout  bank  access  even  before  the  crisis;  static  cross-country  observations  are\ndifficult to interpret or compare.\nOur view (as of May 1999) is that credit contraction in the crisis countries\nwas particularly severe in 1998, hitting different sectors of the economy differently.\nAmong the three hardest-hit countries, Thailand and Korea are now seeing the signs of\nrecovery in real activity and financial intermediation, but the situation in Indonesia\nremains very fragile. Another important question is: if a credit crunch exists, is it the\ncause or the result of weak demand? We would like to examine micro and sectoral data\nto answer this question more fully in the future, but our impression from fragmentary\ninformation is that causality from credit crunch to weak demand cannot be rejected in\nKorea (and indeed Japan).\nd. Accidental non-performing loans\nThe Asian crisis has turned out to be much nastier than originally thought\nbecause the two financial crises were allowed to reinforce each other. At the heart of\nthis  vicious  circle  lies  the  problem  of  non-performing  loans  (NPLs)  of  domestic\nenterprises and financial institutions.\nApart from the well-known problems of lack of transparency and ambiguous\nclassification of loans into different risk categories, there is a more fundamental reason\nwhy NPLs cannot be easily identified. In a crisis-ridden economy, the amount of bad\ndebt is not a fixed sum but a moving target. It is a function of key macroeconomic\nvariables, such as business conditions, exchange rate, interest rates, real estate and\nstock markets, financial disintermediation, and regional and global demand. Under\nnormal circumstances, NPLs are concentrated in enterprises and financial institutions\nwith weak management\u2014and, as such, is a microeconomic problem. But in a crisis,\neven potentially viable firms and banks face default risks due to forces beyond their\ncontrol. Inevitable, hopeless NPLs arising from micro-level mismanagement should be\ndistinguished from accidental NPLs created by macroeconomic instability. Admittedly,\nthis distinction is often blurred in rapidly changing circumstances; yet conceptually,\nrecognition of these two types of NPLs is essential for designing a good crisis-response.\nIn the context of the Asian economies with heavy exposure to short-term\nbank loans and foreign-currency borrowing, accidental NPLs are created by the initial\nbalance-sheet  effect  of  a  large  depreciation  or  high  interest  rates  (or  both).  Once\npermitted to develop, accidental NPLs will multiply by igniting bankruptcies, credit\ncontraction, stoppage of account settlements and letter-of-credit opening, down-grading\nof credit rating, increases in interest premia, asset deflation and domestic business\nslump\u2014all of which undermine confidence of overseas (and domestic) investors. This in\nturn causes further depreciation and an increased need to raise interest rates (if higher\ninterest rates are incorrectly believed to prevent the currency fall) which makes NPLs\neven greater. The economy is trapped\u2014and the currency falls in total disregard of\npurchasing power parity. How to terminate this destructive chain reaction is the key\nquestion to be addressed.\nIn Thailand, it is reported that NPLs were 15 percent of total outstanding\nloans when the baht crisis broke out in the summer of 1997. The ratio rose to 25\n18", "percent by the end of 1997 and further climbed to 30 percent in mid 1998 and to 43\npercent at end 1998. Unattended, it may even reach 50 percent by mid 1999. As of\nFebruary 1999, it is estimated that the required bank recapitalization would amount to\n20 percent of GDP. Financial intermediation and account settlements through banks\nare paralyzed and the economy has regressed back to barter and cash transactions. 80\npercent  of  enterprises  are  without  bank  access  and  inter-firm  lending  has  also\ndeclined. As a result, the operation ratio of manufacturing industry has plummeted to\na mere 50 percent.15\nThe situation in which half of the bank loans are bad is daunting indeed. Yet,\na large part of the Thai NPLs is not the result of a sudden loss of management\ncapability among Thai businesses between 1997 and 1999. Rather, it was caused by\nmacroeconomic deterioration for which individual enterprise managers can hardly be\nblamed. Bad debt statistics and banks\u2019 recapitalization requirements are artificially\ninflated during an acute crisis, and they will be reduced to less intimidating (although\nstill high) levels if proper policy measures reflecting the new nature of the crisis are\nimplemented.\nIV. Actual Policy Responses\na. The critical initial months\nCircumstances  surrounding  the  three  hardest-hit  countries\u2014Thailand,\nIndonesia and Korea\u2014are discussed widely (for example, see Shirai (1999)), and we\nhave no intention to contend with that literature. But a brief review of policy sequences\nin the critical initial months of the crisis is nonetheless useful for evaluating the\nappropriateness of the conventional and other policies adopted to counter the crisis in\nlight of the arguments presented in this paper. The following accounts are summarized\nfrom IMF (1999).\nThailand: the August 20, 1997 stand-by agreement was aimed at restoring\nconfidence,  bringing  about  an  orderly  reduction  in  the  current-account  deficit,\nreconstituting foreign exchange reserves, and limiting the rise in inflation to the one-\noff  effects  of  the  depreciation.  Key  elements  of  the  policy  package  were  financial\nrestructuring (including closure of insolvent financial institutions), fiscal tightening,\ncontrol of domestic credit, and indicative ranges for interest rates. Thailand drew 4\nbillion dollars (of which 1.2 billion dollars was from the IMF) upon approval of the\nprogram.\nFollowing the program initiation, the baht continued to slide and the loss of\noutput turned out to be greater than anticipated. At the first quarterly review in\nDecember 1997, the program was strengthened with additional fiscal measures, lower\nmonetary  and  credit  targets,  and  higher  interest  rates.  A  specific  timetable  for\nfinancial sector restructuring was announced.\nAfter this, the baht bottomed out but output continued to fall. In subsequent\nprogram  reviews  (March,  June,  and  September  1998),  fiscal  policy  became  more\n                                                  \n15 This paragraph is based on information provided by Virabongsa Ramangkura, former deputy prime\nminister of Thailand, at the 6th Symposium of the Institute for International Monetary Affairs, Tokyo,\nFebruary 2, 1999.\n19", "expansionary,  but  the  revisions  of  monetary  and  interest  rate  policies  were  more\ncautious, conditional on the movement of the exchange rate.\nIndonesia:  the  November  5,  1997  stand-by  agreement  was  intended  to\nrestore market confidence, bring about an orderly adjustment in the current account,\nlimit the unavoidable decline in output growth, and contain the inflationary impact of\nexchange  rate  depreciation.  The  policy  package  included  tight  monetary  policy,\nexchange rate intervention (see footnote 18), fiscal restraint, a plan to close non-viable\nfinancial institutions, and corporate sector reforms. At this time, the IMF disbursed 3\nbillion dollars.\nFollowing  this,  the  program  was  not  implemented  adequately  and,  with\nadditional political instability, the Indonesian rupiah  fell  precipitously  and  capital\noutflows increased. A strengthened Fund program was announced on January 15, 1998\nfeaturing tight monetary policy and acceleration of structural reforms, especially bank\nrestructuring. However, market response was skeptical and the Indonesian economy\nwas on the verge of a vicious circle of depreciation and inflation.\nThe first program review of May 4, 1998 permitted more expansionary fiscal\npolicy to counter output decline, but strengthened other elements of the program.\nMonetary policy targets were tightened with sharply higher interest rates and strict\ncontrol over central bank net domestic assets. Also included were an expanded set of\nfar-reaching structural reforms (privatization and dismantling of monopolies and price\ncontrols) as well as restructuring of corporate sector obligations and rollover of short-\nterm bank debt.\nKorea: with a high level of short-term debt and only moderate international\nreserves, Korea began to face difficulty in rolling over its short-term foreign liabilities\nin  October  1997.  To  restore  market  confidence,  the  December  4,  1997  stand-by\nagreement was aimed to bring about an orderly adjustment in the current account,\nbuild up foreign exchange reserves, and contain inflation through monetary and fiscal\nmeasures. In addition, the program included a range of structural reforms in the\nfinancial and corporate sectors. The Fund disbursed 5.5 billion dollars upon program\napproval.\nImmediately after this, with usable international reserves nearly exhausted\nand the won in free fall, confidence was further undermined. But the acute \u201cliquidity\u201d\ncrisis came to an end as an agreement was reached on December 24, 1997 with private\nbank creditors to maintain exposure. Voluntary rescheduling of short-term debt was\nagreed on January 28, 1998. The Fund also accelerated disbursements in return for\nfaster financial reforms and higher interest rates.\nAgainst  the  background  of  an  improving  exchange  market  situation  and\ngrowing signs of a pronounced decline in economic activity, the first quarterly review of\nFebruary 17, 1998 permitted a more expansionary fiscal policy but monetary policy\nwas  to  remain  tight  as  long  as  the  exchange  market  situation  remained  fragile.\nStructural reform agenda were further specified and broadened.\nb. Right diagnosis, wrong medicine\nFrom  these  rough  sketches,  the  distinctive  characteristics  of  the  Fund-\n20", "supported programs implemented in the Asian crisis countries can be distilled. First,\nthe strategy was based on macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment, the\ntwo traditional policy pillars to cope with the current-account crisis. Second, as the\nmain problem shifted from exchange rate depreciation to output collapse, fiscal policy\nwas adjusted to be more expansionary but monetary and structural policies remained\ntight or were sometimes further strengthened. Third, the IMF (1999) understood that\nexternal  confidence  crisis  and  domestic  credit  contraction  were  the  two  important\nfeatures of the Asian crisis, but proposed to deal with the former by high interest rates,\ntight budget and credit\u2014paying much less attention to the costs incurred on the latter.\nThese  features  are  in  sharp  contrast  to  our  policy  recommendations\npresented below (section V). Traditional macroeconomic stabilization coupled with fast\nand far-reaching structural reforms wreak havoc on economies trapped in currency and\nbanking crises, resulting in unexpected severity and duration of the Asian crisis. The\nAsian crisis began just like the 1994 Mexican crisis, with overborrowing followed by a\ncapital reversal and currency attacks. Up to this point, the two crises were similar. But\nafter the initial shocks, the Asian crisis developed into something more serious, with\ncontinued free falls of currencies, sharp increases in bad debt, paralysis of financial\nsystems,  collapsing  demand,  shrinking  output  and  employment,  and  regional  and\nglobal contagion. This suggests that new policy prescriptions are badly needed because\nof the particular characteristics of the Asian-type crisis.16\nThe IMF seems to recognize the double nature of the present financial crisis,\nbut has nonetheless insisted on coping with the this type of crisis with traditional\n\u201ccurrent-account crisis\u201d medicine and justifies it even to this date (IMF 1999). The gap\nbetween diagnosis and prescription remains inexplicable.17\nV. Managing Capital-account Crisis and Credit Contraction\na. Basic principles\nAs mentioned earlier, policies required to combat the capital-account crisis\nare quite different from the traditional ones. Moreover, to cope with the twin financial\ncrises, the timing and sequencing of policy measures is critically important. Unlike the\ntraditional  current-account  crisis  for  which  policy  responses  (macroeconomic  belt-\ntightening and supply-side \u201cstructural adjustments\u201d) are straightforward and basically\ntime-invariant,  the  crisis  we  are  discussing  is  much  more  complex.  Right  policies\n                                                  \n16 It is also necessary to examine in detail the validity of key supporting claims of the current approach\nsuch as: (i) high interest rates caused the eventual stabilization of exchange markets; (ii) merits of high\ninterest rates in calming exchange markets outweigh demerits they bring in worsening domestic crisis;\n(iii) fiscal policy was not too tight (cyclical factors must be purged in evaluating the size of the budget\ndeficit); and (iv) fiscal surpluses were needed to prepare for bank recapitalization. Some of these issues\nwere discussed in the text, but full studies are beyond the scope of this paper.\n17 The IMF correctly emphasizes the need \u201cto help break a self-reinforcing cycle of capital outflows,\nexchange rate depreciation, and financial sector weakness\u201d (IMF 1999, p.15). However, it continues\nimmediately: \u201cBut more than in previous Fund programs, structural reforms, particularly in the financial\nsector and related areas, took a central role\u2014indeed, it was structural reforms that were needed to\naddress the root causes of the crises, restore market confidence, and set the stage for a sustainable\nresumption of growth.\u201d This argument is superficial and unconvincing; in particular, it does not address\nthe delicate problem of timing and sequencing which is so crucial in financial rescue and restructuring\n(section V).\n21", "implemented in the wrong sequence can kill the patient instead of curing him.\nMost  importantly,  currency  or  international  liquidity  crisis  should  be\nprevented  from  getting  worse.  In  addition,  domestic  banking  crisis  and  credit\ncontraction should be stopped and reversed. These should be the top policy priorities of\neconomies beset with twin financial crises. In the following subsections, we propose\nnine  measures  to  calm  the  markets  and  restore  confidence  in  the  atmosphere  of\ncurrency and banking crises.\nReflecting the double nature of the crisis, policy prescriptions are divided\ninto two broad categories: those coping with external problems\u2014falling currencies,\ninternational liquidity crisis, contagion, regional coordination, etc.\u2014on the one hand\nand those addressing domestic problems\u2014macroeconomic policies, systemic financial\ncrisis, credit contraction, structural reforms of banks and financial markets, etc.\u2014on\nthe  other.  In  the  past,  financial  crises  have  typically  been  managed  by  national\ngovernments and central banks. But the financial crises in developing Asia are not\ncontained within national borders nor can they be stopped by the efforts of individual\ncountries  alone.  Thus  involvement  of  both  the  international  community  and  the\naffected countries is needed. By combining the following measures on a case-by-case\nbasis (not all need to be implemented depending on the severity of the situation),\nimmediate  financial  difficulties,  both  external  and  internal,  should  be  greatly\nameliorated. Needless to say, once chosen, measures should be implemented as rapidly\nas practically possible.\nb. International policy prescriptions: how outsiders can help\nDonor countries and regional and international financial institutions can\nimplement the following policies.\n(i)  Emergency  financing:  most  importantly,  timely  provision  of  ample\nfinancial  resources,  with  few  strings  attached,  is  essential  to  containing  the\ninternational liquidity crisis in its early stage (surely, policies for restructuring bad\nbanks and strengthening financial markets must be implemented later, but not at this\npoint\u2014see  below).  It  cannot  be  emphasized  too  much  that  an  impressive  sum\ncommitted up-front makes an enormous difference to market psychology, which in turn\nthwarts the crisis and minimizes the amount that needs to be actually withdrawn.\nFinancial aid can take the forms of bilateral and multilateral loans for balance-of-\npayments purposes, accelerated disbursements of existing commitments, rescheduling,\nloan guarantees, export insurance, new trade credits, additional funds for structural\nreforms and social safety nets, and so on. All of these are already in place in Asia, but\nimprovements are possible in terms of size, speed and scope.\nIn this connection, it should be recalled that the Mexican currency crisis of\nDecember 20, 1994 was followed by a credible international rescue package of 50 billion\ndollars  by  January  31,  1995.  In  that  crisis  \u201cthe  response  was  swift,  large,  and\npractically  unconditional,\u201d  unlike  the  Asian  programs  which  \u201cwere  not  large  and\nheavily conditional\u201d (Montes 1998). Moreover, in Asia, actual disbursements which\ncame in phased tranches were much smaller than apparent pledges. In late 1997, the\nidea of the Asian Monetary Fund was immediately turned down\u2014partly for fear of\npossible inconsistency between two sets of conditionalities required by the IMF and the\nproposed AMF.  Agreeing to a long conditionality list was made a prerequisite for the\n22", "Asian programs, but in the Mexican crisis the government\u2019s full reform program was\nannounced only in March 1995, a few months after the panic and contagion subsided.\nHad similarly prompt and generous treatment been offered to Thailand and other\nAsian countries, it is likely that the crisis could have been much milder and shorter in\nduration.\n(ii) Compulsory rollover of short-term foreign private debt: foreign creditors\nwanting to pull out from the countries affected by a systemic crisis should be told\ncollectively to wait and maintain exposure. In the process variously called as \u201crollover,\u201d\n\u201cstandstill,\u201d \u201cbailing-in,\u201d or \u201cmoratorium,\u201d short-term debt can be converted to equity or\nlonger-term  debt.  This  operation  is  essential  to  stop  an  unnecessary  run  on  the\ncountry, prevent free riders among foreign investors, and allocate the costs fairly and\norderly. Korea\u2019s \u201cliquidity\u201d crisis was ended successfully in December 1997 by such an\nagreement, but it would have been even better if it had come a few to several weeks\nsooner. Clearly, individual countries in crisis cannot make private creditors line up\nneatly. An international body such as the G7 or IMF should set up a formal mechanism\nwith appropriate rules, monitoring, enforcement, etc. available to all eligible countries\nwithout  delay  (as  the  Paris  Club  successfully  reschedules  long-term  public  debt\naccording to a predetermined procedure). To the extent that this forced rollover on\nprivate debt is effective, the amount of official money required in (i) above, and the\nneed to support exchange rates in (iii) below, will be accordingly reduced.\n(iii)  Correcting  excessive  undervaluation:  each  country  can  defend  its\ncurrency by market intervention or high interest rates. But once the attack succeeds\nand contagion begins to spread regionally, stronger collective measures are needed to\nrestore systemic currency stability. Specifically, a statement by the G7 or IMF to the\neffect  that  depreciations  are  excessive,  presentation  of  realistic  and  mutually\nconsistent exchange rate targets, exchange stabilization funds, credit-line agreements\namong  central  banks,  and  so  on,  can  be  used.  Furthermore,  the  G7  and  regional\ncountries can participate in coordinated market interventions to directly push up the\nundervalued currencies. Since foreign exchange markets of developing countries are\nthin, a relatively small amount can have a large impact if the intervention is well\norchestrated.18 As noted earlier, raising interest rates is an inappropriate way to cope\nwith a currency crisis accompanied by balance-sheet erosion and credit contraction.\nExcessive undervaluations must be corrected by other means in this type of crisis (also\nsee footnote 20 below).\n(iv)  Coordinated  demand  expansion:  if  only  one  country  experiences  a\ndepreciation,  that  country  can  count  on  rising  exports  thanks  to  improved  price\ncompetitiveness. However, in a regional currency crisis, it is more difficult to export\nyour way out of recession since your competitors also gained competitiveness while\nregional  demand  is  depressed.  Further  competitive  devaluations  will  only  lead  to\nshrinkage of total trade. A better alternative is for each country to expand domestic\ndemand in the early stages of the crisis with positive spillover effects on its neighbors.\nA  regional  or  international  body  can  provide  necessary  coordination  of  fiscal  and\nmonetary policies. However, in countries where expansionary policies have already\n                                                  \n18 Actually, there was a partially successful joint intervention by Japan, Singapore and Indonesia in\nsupport of the Indonesian rupiah in November 1997 (Ito 1999). But from the viewpoint of systemic\ncurrency crisis, this intervention was too small, temporary and ad hoc, and targeting only one currency. To\nmaximize the favorable signal effect of joint intervention, careful preparation, timely execution, and\nappropriate supporting statements are needed.\n23", "been  mobilized  to  the  limit  and  additional  stimuli  are  considered  ineffective  or\nunsustainable,  this  policy  option  is  closed.19  Good  judgment  should  be  used  to\ndistinguish countries with different macroeconomic constraints.\nc. Domestic policy prescriptions: what the government should do\nAs  to  the  government  of  a  crisis  country,  the  following  measures  are\nproposed.\n(v)  No  need  for  tighter  monetary  policy  and  fiscal  consolidation:  this  is\nbecause of the inherent weakness of domestic demand under the capital-account crisis.\n\u201cCyclical\u201d  fiscal  deficits  should  be  allowed  while  monetary  policy  can  remain  just\nneutral (unless the situation worsens and rule (vi) below is triggered).\n(vi) Unlimited and unconditional provision of domestic liquidity: this is the\nwell-known \u201clender of last resort\u201d function of the central bank, which is absolutely\nessential to calm domestic financial institutions and markets seized by runs, illiquidity\nor prohibitive risk premia. During the critical few days or weeks of such financial\npanic,  the  monetary  authority  should  concentrate  on  this  task  while  temporarily\nsuspending monetary policy targets designed for normal times. If this is not done, the\ncrisis will spread irreversibly.20\n(vii)  Compulsory  bank  recapitalization:  in  twin  financial  crises  with\naccidental  NPLs,  banks\u2019  capital  needs  to  be  replenished  so  that  they  can  resume\nnormal lending. Banks should be classified into those which are sound, those requiring\nofficial  help  to  return  to  viability,  and  those  which  are  definitely  insolvent.\nRecapitalization should be directed towards the second type, but obviously not the first\nor third. Once procedure and criteria are set up, recapitalization must be compulsory\nand linked with subsequent restructuring (see below). Otherwise the dithering of bank\nmanagers will delay the rescue process and spread the crisis. Distinguishing three\ntypes of banks is difficult and somewhat arbitrary in a crisis situation, but it must be\ndone  as  pragmatically  as  possible  based  on  the  most  recent  balance  sheets.21  If\nessential  information  is  missing,  the  government  should  directly  audit  the  books.\nInternational assistance may be solicited for this effort.\n(viii)  Temporary  suspension  of  capital  adequacy  standards:  requiring\ninternational capital adequacy standards may be a good idea in normal times, but it\nbrings disaster at a time of credit contraction. Systemic bank failure should be dealt\nwith  very  differently  from  isolated  bank  failure.  In  credit  contraction,  banks  are\n                                                  \n19 For instance, by early 1999, Japan seems to have come to the end of the line as far as aggregate demand\npolicies are concerned. Large and repeated fiscal stimuli in much of the 1990s did not produce robust\neconomic recovery and a further issuance of government bonds now threatens to raise long-term interest\nrates and appreciate the yen, both of which hurt the domestic economy. Monetary policies are also\nimpotent as the entire term structure of interest rates is suppressed to the near-zero level in a situation\nanalogous to the liquidity trap (McKinnon and Ohno 1997).\n20 Walter Bagehot, the 19th century British political economist, advised the government of the day to\nsupply liquidity unlimitedly against a domestic financial crisis and to raise interest rates against an\nexternal one. But the Bagehot rule cannot be applied if the two crises occur simultaneously, as in Asia.\nOur proposal is to adopt the first part of his advice but introduce measures other than high interest rates\n((i) to (iv) above) to cope with the external crisis.\n21 Banks should not be classified according to future balance sheets. If such a policy is adopted, bank\nmanagers have an incentive to reduce lending (denominator) in order to maintain the required capital\nadequacy ratio, aggravating the credit contraction (Yoshitomi 1998).\n24", "constrained by capital ratios rather than the usual reserve ratios as the textbook has\nit. In a fallacy of composition, tightening these standards in crisis may result in lower\nbank capital ratios, not higher. As Stiglitz explains,\nIf capital adequacy standards are rigidly enforced so that when a crisis hits\ncountries  are  at  their  limit,  then  as  defaults  rise  and  bank  net  worth\ndeclines,  either  new  capital  sources  have  to  be  found  or  lending  must\ndecrease. But the midst of crisis is hardly an ideal time for raising new\ncapital, and as a result, lending typically contracts. This naturally further\nweakens the economy, leading to more bankruptcies, and lower net worth,\nand perhaps an even greater shortfall in capital adequacy. (Stiglitz 1999,\np.7)\nA temporary easing or even suspension of capital adequacy standards is called for until\nsuch  time  when  these  requirements  can  be  enforced  without  causing  unintended\nmacroeconomic distress.\n(ix) Providing credit through non-market channels:  financial  mobilization\nshould shift from government to market in the long run, but non-market measures\nshould be actively used to speed up recovery when the market itself is paralyzed.\nLending by public policy banks, such as development and long-term credit banks and\nfinancial institutions for small- and medium-sized enterprises, should obviously be\nboosted, and additional credit schemes and institutions can be established if necessary.\nAdministrative guidance to encourage bank lending can be activated. New credit lines\nor guarantees may be extended with international assistance. In this regard, measures\nintroduced by the Korean authorities in 1998, including new loans by the KLTCB, in\nsection III above should be recalled.\nd. Restructuring phase\nThis  paper  does  not  intend  to  present  an  operational  guideline  for\nrestructuring banks: a subject too important to be treated except in another full paper\nor a book (one of the present authors plans to visit this issue in the future). Here, it\nsuffices to emphasize the importance of distinguishing the two phases, namely bank\nrescue and bank restructuring, and a few issues associated with the latter process.\nIf a proper combination of the above measures are taken, queues outside\nbanks will disappear, domestic bank loans will recover, and the country can rejoin\ninternational financial markets without prohibitive risk premia\u2014in short, the panic\nwould be over. The next important step is to streamline, merge or close bad financial\ninstitutions with vigor and determination. If this is not done, problems are simply\npostponed, and an even larger crisis is likely to occur in the future.\nBut to re-emphasize, only when the twin financial crises are overcome, it is\nsafe  to  move  resolutely  to  the  merger  and  closure  of  bad  financial  institutions\n(preparation  and  announcements  can  be  made  in  advance,  but  not  actual\nimplementation). If strong restructuring measures (which are desirable in the long\nrun) are taken in the middle of credit contraction, it will make the restructuring even\nharder as accidental NPLs accumulate. The key is to move quickly from the rescue\nphase to the restructuring phase by careful choice of policies so as not to derail the\nrecovery process.\n25", "Four additional points deserve mention. First, until normalcy returns in the\nfinancial markets, necessary measures must be implemented on a compulsory, rather\nthan a voluntary, basis. If left to their own judgment, managers of bad banks will take\na  wait-and-see  attitude  hoping  that  the  macroeconomy  will  improve  or  they  will\notherwise be bailed out; but they fear that accepting official assistance early will later\nlead to their having to take responsibility and resign. Such delay tactics can forestall\nthe entire rescue and restructuring process.\nSecond, when a bank is rescued or restructured, negligent or fraudulent\nbank managers should be held accountable, but depositors and borrowing enterprises\nin good standing should always be duly protected. This distinction is crucial. If bank\nclosure is ordered hastily without regard to the integrity of deposits or continued\navailability  of  loans  to  healthy  firms,  it  will  fan  credit  contraction.  Similarly,  the\ngovernment should unambiguously announce that taxpayers\u2019 money will be used\u2014if it\nis to be used\u2014to protect depositors and borrowing enterprises only, not the managers\nor owners of failed banks. Through merger or transfer to another sound bank or a\nspecial  institution,  loans  in  good  standing  should  be  protected,  while  NPLs  are\nrescheduled, liquidated, collected or written off.\nThird,  in  parliamentary  democracies,  political  pressure  from  the  public,\nmedia and opposition parties are often very strong. Typically, they oppose the use of\npublic money to \u201cbail out\u201d large banks and enterprises, and require disclosure of all\navailable information on NPLs (but, as argued above, the amount of NPLs depends on\nmacroeconomic conditions). These may be politically legitimate demands, but from the\nviewpoint of avoiding financial meltdown, they tend to cause unnecessary delays and\nuncertainty.  In this political context, it is important to clearly differentiate between,\nand concentrate upon, the more defensible bailing out of the system as a whole, rather\nthan  bailing  out  management  and  shareholders  of  insolvent  and  weak  financial\ninstitutions.\nFourth, enforcement may be a legitimate problem since \u201cmoney first, reform\nlater\u201d implied in the proposed sequence is the reverse of the procedure required by the\nIMF-supported program. Bank managers may simply grab the money and run. In order\nto minimize this risk, we have emphasized that financial rescue and restructuring\nshould be an integrated process and conducted on a compulsory basis. An international\nfinancial institution can and should develop an operational procedure for linking bank\nrescue and restructuring, which is made available to all eligible member countries.\nVI. Concluding Remarks\nThis paper has argued that the severity and duration of the Asian crisis can\nbe explained by viewing it as a capital-account crisis combined with internal credit\ncontraction.  Due  to  high  interest  rates,  reduced  demand,  capital  adequacy\nrequirements and premature bank closures, the crisis economies were trapped in a\nvicious circle with serious credit contraction, collapsing output and mounting bad debt,\nfrom  which  they  are  only  slowly  recovering.  Given  the  new  nature  of  the  crisis,\ninadequacy of the initial policy responses may be partially forgiven, but the same\nmistake  should  not  be  repeated  in  the  future.  In  particular,  the  international\ncommunity  should  not  impose  policy  conditionalities  designed  for  the  traditional\n26", "current-account  crisis  in  these  new  circumstances.  Instead,  a  new  set  of  properly\nsequenced  measures,  proposed  in  section  V  above,  should  be  considered  and\nintroduced.\nIt is hoped that the proposals contained in this paper will be a useful input to\nthe redesign of global financial architecture under discussion today. In particular, they\nshould help improve policy responses once systemic currency crises occur. But clearly,\nglobal financial architecture needs to include many other new and improved aspects\n(some  of  which  are  being  studied  by  our  Institute).  They  include,  for  example,\ninternational  monetary  system  and  exchange  rate  policies  of  individual  countries,\ncapital controls and monitoring, currency-crisis early warning system, modus operandi\nof  capital-account  liberalization,  data  transparency  and  dissemination,  corporate\ngovernance,  bank  supervision  and  prudential  regulation,  accounting  standards,\nmacroeconomic  policies  to  deflate  unsustainable  lending  booms,  and  the  general\nquestion of how to reconcile \u201cglobal\u201d or market standards with unique local or regional\npractices.  Improvements  in  these  areas\u2014of  which  nuanced  crisis  response  is  an\nintegral part\u2014must proceed in tandem in order to minimize the size and frequency of\nthe new financial crises that have become all too common in this decade.\n27", "Appendix\nFirst- and Second-Generation Models of Currency Crisis\nTo explain why currency attacks occur, there have been two sequential lines\nof research in the last two decades. This appendix summarizes them in their simplest\nforms based on the review by Flood and Marion (1998).\nFirst-generation models attribute currency crisis to economic fundamentals\nwhich evolve inconsistently with the commitment of a fixed exchange rate (Krugman\n1979, Flood and Garber 1984). Specifically, excessive monetary expansion will lead\ninevitably to a breakdown of the fixed parity. With wrong fundamentals, occurrence of\na currency attack is certain. In this type of model, the only analytically interesting\nquestion is when the attack will happen.\nLet money market equilibrium be\n(A1) m \u2013 p = \u2013\u00e1 (i),  \u00e1 > 0\nwhere m is the domestic supply of high-powered money, p is the domestic price level\n(both in logs), and i is the domestic interest rate. In the central bank\u2019s balance sheet,\nhigh-powered money is backed by domestic credit (d) and international reserves (r):22\n(A2) m = d + r\nThe price level is determined by purchasing power parity:\n(A3) p = p* + s\nwhere,  in  logs,  p*  is  the  foreign  price  level  and  s  is  the  exchange  rate  (domestic\ncurrency/foreign currency). The interest rate is governed by uncovered interest parity:\n(A4) i = i* + s\nwhere i* is the foreign interest rate and the dot signifies actual and expected change.\nFor simplicity, let us assume that p* and i* are constant.\nDuring the pre-crisis fixed-rate period (when s = 0), p and i are externally\ngiven via (A3) and (A4). Thus m is also given by (A1). Suppose domestic credit, d, grows\nat the rate of \u00ec   (say, due to deficit financing). With a fixed m, (A2) will determine the\ncomposition of high-powered money: as d increases, r will fall by the same amount. If\nthe situation continues, the country will eventually run out of international reserves.\nBut when?\nLet us define the shadow exchange rate as the hypothetical floating rate s\nthat would prevail if a currency attack occurs at that time\u2014the rate that equilibrates\nthe money market after international reserves are exhausted by an attack. From (A1),\n                                                  \n22 For simplicity, m, d and r are expressed in logs. Equation (A2) can be considered as a log-linearized\nversion of the original identity.\n28", "we have d \u2013 s = \u2013\u00e1 (s). Thus, the shadow exchange rate is:\n(A5) s =\u00e1 \u00ec   + d\nAs domestic credit expands, the shadow exchange rate depreciates (rises). If the actual\nfixed rate s is above the shadow rate, an attack will not occur because that would lead\nto  the  appreciation  of  the  domestic  currency  imposing  losses  on  speculators.  In\ncontrast, it is profitable to attack if the shadow rate is above the actual. Competition\namong speculators ensures that the attack\u2014which is foreseen\u2014will occur exactly when\nthe two exchange rates coincide, at point A in Figure A1. At that time, high-powered\nmoney  drops  by  the  amount  of  the  attack  and  the  interest  rate  jumps  upward.\nSubsequently, the exchange rate will depreciate at the same rate as the expansion of\ndomestic credit.\nSecond-generation  models  differ  from  the  first  in  that  they  can  explain\ncurrency  attacks  even  without  an  obvious  worsening  of  economic  fundamentals.\nTechnically, this can be shown by introducing nonlinearity in government behavior.\nThere are many ways to achieve this, for example, (i) by assuming different growth\nrates of domestic credit before and after an attack; or (ii) when government faces a\ntrade-off  between  the  fixed  exchange  rate  policy  and  other  policy  goals\u2014such  as\nconcerns  for  unemployment,  NPLs,  public  debt  burden  or  upcoming  elections.\nAssumptions of policy nonlinearity generally lead to multiple equilibria\u2014both attack\nand no-attack solutions are possible\u2014and the attendant phenomena of self-fulfilling\nspeculation, information cascades, herd behavior and the like.\nAs one of such models, consider Obstfeld (1994) as simplified by Flood and\nMarion (1998). The government\u2019s optimizing behavior is described as:\n(A6) min L = \u00e4 2 / 2  + (\u00e4 \u2013 E\u00e4 \u2013 u \u2013 k )2 / 2\nwhere L is the social loss function, \u00e4  is the rate of currency depreciation, E\u00e4  is the\nexpected  rate  of  currency  depreciation,  u  is  a  disturbance  with  zero-mean  and\nvariance\u00f3 2 , and k is a measure of distortion. Two modes of policymaking\u2014a rule or\ndiscretion\u2014are available. The rule requires the government to set policy regardless of\nthe current shock (u) while discretion allows the government to respond to the current\nstate including u and E\u00e4 . This formulation presents the problem of time inconsistent\npolicymaking; the government is tempted each period to exploit predetermined private\nexpectations  to  expand  the  economy  and  overcome  the  distortion.  Meanwhile,  the\nprivate sector understands the nature of the temptation that the government faces.\nIf the government adopts a rule, namely, fixed exchange rate policy with\u00e4  =\n0, we have E\u00e4 = 0 so that the expected value of the loss function is computed to be:\n(A7) ELR = (\u00f3 2 + k2 ) / 2\nOn the other hand, if the government follows discretion, the private sector knows this\npolicy and forms E\u00e4 D = k, then the expected value of the loss function is:\n(A8) ELD =\u00f3 2 /4  + k2\nIf there is no shock hitting the economy (\u00f3 2 = 0 ), the rule is clearly superior because\n29", "ELR < ELD. But in the presence of shocks, the two policies cannot be ranked so easily.\nSuppose the government pursues a mixed strategy with an escape clause: it follows the\nrule  (fixed  exchange  rate  policy)  most  of  the  time  but  switches  to  discretion\n(devaluation) when the shock is sufficiently large.\nThe policymaker\u2019s problem is to decide the size of disturbance u that triggers\nthe escape clause. That threshold value is u where u satisfies:\n(A9) LR(u) = LD(u) + C\nwhere C is the cost of policy switch (say, the loss of credibility or capital gain forgone by\nthe monetary authority). This equation is nonlinear partly because of the nature of\nexpectation formation as a probability-weighted average of no change and devaluation,\nand its solution depends on the shape of the shock distribution.\nAs an example, Figure A2 depicts one possible situation following Obstfeld\u2019s\nparameterization with uniform shock distribution. The curved line plots a function of\nLR \u2013 LD and the horizontal line represents a function of C. The two lines intersect\ntwice. If the private sector adopts u  as its belief about the level of disturbance at\nH\nwhich the government will abandon fixed exchange rate policy, then the government\nfinds that accepting this value also solves the government\u2019s optimization problem. By\ncontrast, if the private sector adopts u , it is optimal for the government to accept this\nL\nvalue  instead.  Thus  there  are  two  possible  solutions:  the  one  in  which  the  fixed\nexchange rate is defended against most shocks and the other in which it is abandoned\nwhen even a small shock hits and therefore currency attacks are more frequent.\n30", "References\nFlood, Robert, and Peter Garber [1984] \u201cCollapsing Exchange-Rate Regimes: Some\nLinear Examples,\u201d Journal of International Economics vol.17, pp.90-107.\nFlood, Robert, and Nancy Marion [1998] \u201cPerspectives on the Recent Currency Crisis\nLiterature,\u201d NBER Working Paper 6380 (January).\nInternational Monetary Fund [1999] IMF-Supported Programs in Indonesia, Korea,\nand Thailand: A Preliminary Assessment (January).\nIto, Takatoshi [1999] \u201cAjia Tsuka Kiki to IMF\u201d (The Asian Currency Crisis and the\nIMF), Keizai Kenkyu 50:1, 68-94 (January).\nKrugman, Paul [1979] \u201cA Model of Balance-of-Payments Crises,\u201d Journal of Money,\nCredit, and Banking 11, pp.311-325.\nMcKinnon,  Ronald  I.
