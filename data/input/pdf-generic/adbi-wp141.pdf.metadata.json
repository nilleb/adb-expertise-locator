INTRODUCTION \nThe current economic crisis has heightened concerns about poverty across the world. One \noutcome  of  the  recent  Group  of  Twenty  (G-20)  meeting  in  London  was  a  call  for  all \ndeveloped countries to fulfill their commitments on providing aid and continued development \nassistance to the developing world. Indeed, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recently \nreceived a 200% General Capital Increase, while announcing a US$3 billion counter-cyclical \nsupport facility for the region.  \nThe extent to which these measures will offset the major economic slowdown in the region \nremains unclear. The full extent of the slowdown\u2019s impacts on the poor is also as yet \nunknown, but ADB is projecting an additional 131 million poor in 2010 (ADB 2009).  \nWhile poverty reduction remains a major pillar in the development agendas of multilateral \ndevelopment banks, the current economic situation has placed increased stress on available \nresources. Not only are donor countries experiencing pressure at home to prop up their own \neconomies,  traditional  aid  agencies  and  domestic  governments  alike  are  also  facing \nincreasing, and increasingly diverse, demands for funds. Rarely has the need to maximize \nvalue for every public dollar spent been more important. \nDespite the significant inroads made in the region, poverty is still a major challenge in Asia. \nWhile cases of extreme poverty (i.e. those living on US$1/day or less) have fallen, the \nnumber of those living at or near the poverty line of US$2/day remains high. Along with the \nrise in the number of \u2018working poor\u2019 has come a rise in income inequality. Indeed, studies \nhave shown increasing levels of income inequality over the last ten years in Asia (Ali 2008).   \nThese trends have not been lost on policymakers. \u201cEquitable growth\u201d and \u201cholistic growth\u201d \nhave become the new catchwords in development policy formulation. Large economies such \nas India and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) have instituted a number of policies to \naddress  the  potentially  destabilizing  effects  of  the  over-concentration  of  benefits  within \nparticular groups in society (Ganguly 2009). \nThe ultimate distribution of benefits from policy or public spending is pivotal for a number of \nreasons. First, from a strictly economic sense, as the number of consumers grows, so do \nopportunities for market expansion and competition. This allows companies to reap the \nbenefits of economies of scale and scope. Economies that support competitive markets \nenjoy greater innovation and increase consumer utility by widening product choice and \nservice provision. Second, from a social policy perspective, a policy that has limited impacts \non income can lead to uneven income growth. This, in turn, can lead to social unrest and the \ndevelopment  of  a  permanent  underclass.  Aside  from  raising  moral  dilemmas,  these \noutcomes represent real burdens on government budgets. Expanding the potential gains \nfrom any development project can ease such pressures on government budgets, while \nsimultaneously expanding the tax base. Thus, it is imperative that policymakers understand \nand anticipate the potential income effects of public spending or policy initiatives, and plan \naccordingly. \nThis paper outlines one way of measuring the impact of policy initiatives on the poor. The \nuse of the poverty headcount to measure poverty impact is well established (Bourguignon \n2003; Ravallion and Dat 1999; Ravallion and Chen 1997). However, this approach usually \nmeasures the impact of policy on the poor in general, and not on specific groups. The \nconsequences of policy reforms vary widely among various household segments, depending \non their primary source of income, endowment, and consumption patterns. Therefore, it is \nimportant to stratify households according to income source and decompose their factor \nearnings, when attempting to determine the actual impact of policy measures. This can be \ndone by calculating the effects of changes in the factor earnings on poverty headcount \nacross strata (Hertel et al. 2007a).  \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 141    Komoto and Stone \n \nIn order to measure the impacts of various transport policy initiatives in Cambodia and Lao \nPDR,  households  were  stratified  according  to  primary  income  source.  Five  groups  of \nhouseholds that rely almost solely (95% or more) on one source of income were identified. \nThe households that rely on several sources of income (less than 95% on each source) were \nclassified as diversified, and further broken down into rural and urban households. In total, \nthere  are  seven  strata:  self  employed  agriculture  based,  self-employed  non-agriculture \nbased, rural and urban wage earners, transfer-based, and rural and urban diversified (Hertel \net al. 2007a).  \nIncome  earned  by  households  in  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR  was  taken  from  household \nsurveys  and  categorized  into  ten  factor  income  sources:  Land,  Agriculture-Unskilled \n(AgUnskl);  Agriculture-  Skilled  (AgSkl);  Non-agriculture-Unskilled  (NagUnskl);  Non-\nAgriculture-Skilled (NagSkl); Wage-Unskilled (WgUnskl); Wage-Skilled (WgSkl); Agriculture \nCapital (Agcap); Non-Agriculture-Capital (Nagcap); and Transfers. AgUnskl and AgSkl are \nimputed  returns  to  self-employed  agriculture  labor.  NagUnskl  and  NagSkl  are  imputed \nreturns to self-employed non-agriculture labor. WgUnskl and WgSkl are labor wages that \nwere reported directly in the survey as wage earnings. Land and Agcap are split from the \nresidual of agriculture profits and determined by alpha (as derived from the Global Trade \nAnalysis Project [GTAP] database). Nagcap is the residual of non-agriculture profits. Finally, \ntransfers include both public and private transfers (Hertel et al. 2007a).  \nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II outlines the data cleaning \nprocedure; Section III describes how the Cambodia and Lao PDR household data were \nlinked to the GTAP data; and Section IV briefly discusses the methodology\u2019s strengths and \nweaknesses.  The  succeeding  sections  illustrate  the  structure  of  poverty  around  the \nneighborhood of the poverty line, and provide some policy implications. The last section \nconcludes.   \n2.  \u201cCLEANING\u201d THE HOUSEHOLD DATASETS \nThis paper uses the Cambodia Household Socio-Economic Survey from 2003 to 2004 and \nthe Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS III) from 2002 to 2003. The Cambodia \nsurvey  includes  all  24  provinces,  from  which  900  villages  (6.3%)  were  selected,  with \nprobability  proportional  to  size.  The  Cambodia  survey  covers  household  socio- \ndemographics  such  as  age,  educational  attainment,  occupation,  industry,  sector,  and \npossession of durable goods. It also contains household income, household consumption, \ncrop production, and household expenditure, time use, as well as social indicators such as \nhealth, fertility, HIV/AIDS,1 migration, and victims of violence. LECS III\u2019s sampling frame \ncomprises all 18 provinces, from which 540 villages (5%) were sampled with probability \nproportional to size (i.e., number of villages per province). LECS includes the following \nvariables: age, educational attainment, industry, sector, possession of durable goods, time \nuse,  household  income,  household  consumption,  crop  production,  and  household \nexpenditure, as well as social indicators such as health and infrastructure.2 \nBoth datasets were \u201ccleaned\u201d using the following procedure:  \na.  Observations with missing socio-demographic variables and household \nincome were deleted, as there were no relevant information on which to \nbase the imputation of values. The Cambodia dataset initially consisted \nof 14,984 households, but 11 households were deleted; therefore, only \n14,973 households were used. As for Lao PDR, only one respondent \nwas deleted, leaving 7,998 households for analysis. \n                                                 \n1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome \n2 Details of the Cambodian survey are included as Appendix 1 and those for Lao PDR as Appendix 2. \n2 ", "ADBI Working Paper 141    Komoto and Stone \n \nb.  Units of analysis across these spreadsheets were standardized at the \nhousehold level. Some variables reported by all household members\u2014\nsuch as wage, outputs, expenses, profits, property rents, dividends, and \ntransfers\u2014were thus aggregated into a single value representing the \nwhole household.  \nc.  Wages were imputed to self-employed income using the mean wage of \nrespondents  with  the  same  set  of  characteristics  (including  age, \neducation, skill, and industry of employment). For observations that did \nnot  match,  education  and  industry  were  aggregated  into  larger \nclassifications (Tables A1.3, A1.4, and A2.2). To illustrate, wages of \nemployed respondents who were reported as 18 years old, seventh \ngrader, unskilled, and farmers could not be used to impute wages for \nself-employed  respondents  who  had  similar  characteristics\u2014i.e.,  18 \nyears old, unskilled and farmer, but were eighth graders. To remedy this, \nall respondents who finished sixth to eighth grade were collapsed into \none category called lower secondary; this allowed a match between self \nemployed respondents and wage earners who possessed a similar set \nof characteristics: 18 years old, unskilled, farmers, and lower secondary \n(that is, either sixth, seventh, or eighth graders). This procedure greatly \nincreased the number of matched respondents. \nd.  Some missing industry data were filled using the information or clues \nprovided by occupation. For example, for some respondents whose \noccupations were salespersons or security guards, it was assumed that \nthe corresponding industry is services.  \ne.  One concern about the Lao PDR dataset was that respondents were \nclassified  into  agriculture  and  non-agriculture workers,  but  were  not \ncategorized as employed or self-employed. To separate the employed \nfrom  the  self  employed  among  the  non-agriculture  workers,  the \nfollowing  approach  was  taken:  based  on  the  responses  of  the \nhousehold-head  to  questions  about  family  business,  if  a  household \nowned a non-agriculture business, then he or she was self-employed. \nAlso, if the other household members worked in the same industry as \nthe household head, then they were assumed to be working in the \nfamily business, and classified as self-employed. Among the agriculture \nworkers,  based  on  the  household  heads\u2019  responses  to  agriculture \nbusiness-related  questions  in  the  questionnaire,  if  a  household \noperated its own agriculture business, then he or she was considered \nself-employed. Households that did not run their own farm business \nwere assumed to be employed by other people who ran an agricultural \nbusiness.  \nf.  For Cambodia, occupation was used to determine the skill level for \neach income category. However, the Lao PDR dataset did not report \noccupation. Thus, education (Table A2.2) was used as proxy indicator \nfor skill in the Lao PDR data, since studies have shown that workers\u2019 \nproductivity or skill depends both on years of education and what is \nlearned at school (Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd 1995; Murnane, \nWillett, and Levy 1995 in Fasih 2008). Ninth graders and above were \nconsidered skilled, and the rest were categorized as unskilled.  \ng.  Finally, for the Lao PDR dataset, 90% of crop price data were taken \nfrom  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  Statistics  (FAOSTAT) \ndatabase.  \n3 ", "ADBI Working Paper 141    Komoto and Stone \n \n3.  LINKING REPORTED INCOME TO THE GTAP PRIMARY \nFACTORS \nHousehold income was linked to the GTAP factors following the methodology in Ivanic \n(2004): \nAssumption 1, Wage labor: Wages are received by employed household members, not by \nemployers,  or  the  self-employed.  These  include  cash  and  in  kind  (with  reported  cost \nestimates provided in the respective questionnaire). \nAssumption  2,  Skilled  labor:  Reported  and  imputed  wages  were  classified  based  on  a \nperson\u2019s  skill  level  as either  skilled  or  unskilled.  For  Cambodia,  GTAP\u2019s  definition  was \nfollowed:  all  professional  workers  and  managers  were  classified  as  skilled;  unskilled \notherwise. For Lao PDR, education was used as proxy (as described above). \nAssumption 3, Transfers: Transfers include both government and private transfers. \nAssumption  4,  Property  rents:  Property  rents  are  either  agriculture  or  non-agriculture \nproperty  rents.  Agricultural  property  rents  include  rental  payments  for  land,  farming \nequipment, and other agricultural instruments. Non-agricultural property rents include rental \npayments for buildings, houses, non-agricultural equipment, and non-agricultural dividends. \nIn the Cambodia dataset, agricultural property rents include rental payments for land and \nponds, while non-agricultural property rents include dividends and rental payments for house \nand building space. In the Lao dataset, agricultural property rents include rental payments \nfor land, while non-agricultural property rents include dividends and rental payments for \nhouse and building space.  \nAssumption 5, Agriculture vs. non-agriculture: Based on the definition in the Cambodia and \nLao PDR questionnaires, farming, livestock, fishing, and forestry are considered agricultural, \nwhile mining, services, and manufacturing are non-agricultural. \nAssumption 6, Imputation of capital: The value of capital is the residual of the reported \nbusiness income less the estimated return to labor. This applies to both agriculture and non-\nagriculture sector. \nAssumption  7,  Estimated  returns to  labor:  The  imputed  labor income  for  all household \nmembers involved in the business. The imputed labor income for a household member was \ndetermined as the average wage of all workers in the survey dataset that: (i) earned wage \nincome  only;  and  (ii)  possessed  an  identical  set  of  personal  characteristics,  i.e.,  age, \neducation level, skill level, and industry of employment.  \nAssumption 8, Returns to Land: The value of returns to land is the GTAP-determined fixed \nratio of capital returns in agriculture. Returns to land and capital were split from the sum of \nagricultural property rents and the residual of reported business income and imputed wage, \nusing the factor payment shares from the GTAP database derived from econometric studies \nof cost shares in agriculture (Hertel, Ivanic, and Cranfield. 2004). For Asia, alpha is .88 \n(Table 1). \nAssumption 9: Following the definition of business income in Ivanic (2004), agricultural \nbusiness income includes imputed agricultural wage, returns to capital, and returns to land, \nwhile  non-agricultural  business  income  contains  imputed  non-agricultural  wage,  non-\nagricultural capital, and non-agricultural property income. Total household income includes \nall sources of household income; that is, the sum of all factor income: Agskl, AgUskl, Nagskl, \nNagUskl, Wgeskl, WgeUskl, Agcap, Land, Nagcap, and Transfers.  \n4 ", "ADBI Working Paper 141    Komoto and Stone \n \nTable 1: Definition of Factor Income \nFactor return  Definition \nAgri Skilled labor  Imputed agri skilled labor \nAgri Unskilled labor  Imputed agri unskilled labor \nNon-Agri Skilled labor  Imputed non-agri skilled labor \nNon-Agri Unskilled labor  Imputed non-agri unskilled labor \nWage Skilled labor  skilled labor wages \nWage Unskilled labor  Unskilled labor wages \nAgri capital  Max(0,(1-\u03b1)((b -w )+p )) \na  a a\nNon-agri capital  Max(0,((b -w )+p ) \nn  n n\nLand  Max(0,(\u03b1( (b -w )+p )) \na  a a\nTransfers  Private transfers + public transfers \n\u03b1 w\n*  = 88%; b =agricultural business income; b =non-agricultural business income;  =imputed agriculture labor; \na n a\nw\n=imputed non-agriculture labor; p = agricultural property rent; p = non-agricultural property rent.  \nn a n\nTable 2 is a revised version of the example in Ivanic (2004) of how business income is \nbroken down, following the formulas in Table 1. For example, if a household reported a total \nof US$100 of agricultural business income, of which US$60 is imputed labor income from \nagricultural activities, profit is equal to US$100 less imputed wage; that is, US$40. The \ncombined return to land and capital is equal to the profit plus reported property income. To \nobtain the returns to land, multiply this figure (US$70) with the GTAP determined alpha, \n88%. In the non-agricultural business, the return to capital would be zero, as the imputed \nwage is equal to reported business income.  \nTable 2: Breakdown of Business Income \n  Agricultural business  Non-agricultural business \nincome  income \na) Reported business  60 +40 =100  60+0=60 \nincome \nb) imputed wage  60  60 \nc) residual (a-b)  100-60 =40  60-60=0 \nd) reported property income  30  30 \ne) land +capital (c+d)  30+ 40  0 \nf) returns to land  70\u03b1  0 \ng) returns to capital  70(1-\u03b1)  0 \n4.  STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES \nWhile other poverty impact analysis methodologies like cross-section regressions show the \nimpact of policy reforms on general poverty, their results hide the specific gainers and losers \nof such reforms. Applying this paper\u2019s method, GTAP can utilize multi-poverty elasticities \nwhich capture the shape of income distribution for specific subgroups from the survey data, \nand thus determine the mobility and distributional welfare of these subgroups in different \nsimulations (Hertel, Keeney, and Winters 2007b).  \nCompared to national accounts data, survey data better reflect labor force classification \nwithout significant sampling bias. However, the real size of economic activities may be \nunderstated; some households may underreport their incomes, and it is likely that the richest \nhouseholds are underrepresented. To address this issue, Ivanic (2004) added the residual of \nthe GTAP totals and the survey factor returns to the survey data. It is important that surveys \nare properly designed in order to minimize the discrepancy.  \n5 ", "ADBI Working Paper 141    Komoto and Stone \n \nImputation of labor income to self-employed individuals decreases the variance, as values in \nthis variable tend to lump together towards the mean. In order to better capture the true \nvariability across labor income values, future household surveys can include questions on \nthe actual income of household members who participate in the household business. Also, \nthis methodology can be improved by utilizing surveys that have better coverage than the \nCambodia (6.3%) and Lao PDR (5%) surveys. In sum, the methodology can be readily \nextended to other developing countries\u2019 survey data, provided that they have representative \ncoverage, sound sampling design, good quality, and timely data.  \n5.  STRUCTURE OF POVERTY \nThe entire population was characterized from poorest to richest. Applying the World Bank\u2019s \nUS$1 and US$2 poverty headcounts, 33.8% (ADB 2007) and 77.7% (WDI 2007) of the \nCambodian households are below the US$1/day and US$2/day poverty lines, respectively. \nAs for Lao PDR, 28% of the population is below the US$1 poverty line (ADB 2003); while \n74% is below the US$2 poverty line (WDI 2007). These poverty lines apply to all subsequent \nprocedures in this paper. \nThe poverty income levels were taken back into the household strata to give an estimate of \nthe headcount by stratum. Cross-tabulation of the variables strata and households obtained \npoverty rate per stratum, poverty headcount share in total poverty, and poverty headcount \nshare in total population. Table 3 shows that in Cambodia, poverty is largely concentrated in \nthe rural diversified followed by the agriculture sectors; in Lao PDR, the poorest are in \nagriculture, followed by the rural diversified sectors. The frequency tables for occupation and \nindustry  in the  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR  datasets  (Tables  A1.5  and  A2.3,  respectively) \nsubstantiate these figures. \nTable 3: Structure of Poverty Headcount by Earnings-Based Stratum and country \n(percent) \nNon- Urban   Rural   Urban   Rural  \nIndicator  Agriculture  Transfers  Total \nAgriculture  Labor  Labor  Diversified  Diversified \nCambodia: US$1/day \nPoverty rate in \n48.5  16.3  26.6  34.2  76.3  17.8  31.8  33.8 \nstratum \nShare in total \n39.3  3.2  2.0  2.1  1.1  6.3  46.1  100.0 \npoverty  \nShare in total \n13.3  1.1  0.7  0.7  0.4  2.1  15.6  33.8 \npopulation \nLao PDR: US$1/day \nPoverty rate in \n34.81  23.94  20.74  28.00  85.71  15.06  14.84  28.0 \nstratum \nShare in total \n77.03  4.02  1.25  0.31  0.80  5.36  11.22  100.0 \npoverty  \nShare in total \n21.56  1.13  0.35  0.09  0.23  1.50  3.14  28.0 \npopulation \nCambodia: US$2/day \nPoverty rate in \n90.7  59.9  59.4  72.6  86.8  57.3  78.8  77.7 \nstratum \nShare in total \n32.0  5.1  1.9  1.9  0.6  8.8  49.8  100.0 \npoverty  \nShare in total \n24.9  4.0  1.5  1.5  0.4  6.8  38.7  77.7 \npopulation \nLao PDR: US$2/day \nPoverty rate in \n82.76  50.53  71.85  64.00  90.48  54.20  62.92  74.0 \nstratum \nShare in total \n69.27  3.21  1.64  0.27  0.32  7.30  17.98  100.0 \npoverty  \nShare in total \n51.25  2.38  1.21  0.20  0.24  5.40  13.30  74.0 \npopulation \n6 ", "ADBI Working Paper 141    Komoto and Stone \n \n5.1  Earnings Share at the Poverty Line \nSimilarly, poverty income levels were taken back into the strata to estimate  the average \nfactor income shares in total household income, in the neighborhood of the poverty line.

The trends in Table 4 show that households depend highly on \n(imputed) unskilled labor income.  \n \nTable 4: Average Factor Income Shares Using 10% of Stratum HH around the Poverty \nLine, per Stratum and Country \nAg  Nag  Nag  Wg  Wg  Ag  Nag \nStrata  AgSkl  Land  Transfer  Total \nUnskl  Skl  Unskl  Skl  Unskl  Cap  Cap \nCambodia: US$1/day \nAgriculture  0.00  0.72  0.00  0.04  0.00  0.03  0.02  0.16  0.01  0.01  1.00 \nNon-\n0.00  0.00  0.00  0.85  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.02  0.12  0.02  1.00 \nAgriculture \nUrban Labor  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.52  0.46  0.00  0.01  0.00  0.01  1.00 \nRural Labor  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.46  0.50  0.00  0.01  0.01  0.01  1.00 \nTransfers  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.02  0.00  0.97  1.00 \nUrban \n0.00  0.19  0.07  0.19  0.18  0.20  0.01  0.04  0.04  0.08  1.00 \nDiversified \nRural \n0.00  0.27  0.05  0.19  0.18  0.17  0.01  0.05  0.03  0.05  1.00 \nDiversified \nLao PDR: US$1/day \nAgriculture  0.23  0.58  0.00  0.02  0.02  0.02  0.01  0.09  0.02  0.01  1.00 \nNon-\n0.00  0.01  0.33  0.32  0.00  0.02  0.00  0.00  0.32  0.00  1.00 \nAgriculture \nUrban Labor  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.49  0.51  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  1.00 \nRural Labor  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.61  0.39  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  1.00 \nTransfers  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  1.00  1.00 \nUrban \n0.09  0.16  0.15  0.16  0.15  0.13  0.00  0.02  0.08  0.07  1.00 \nDiversified \nRural \n0.12  0.21  0.11  0.14  0.14  0.09  0.01  0.04  0.10  0.06  1.00 \nDiversified \nCambodia: US$2/day \nAgriculture  0.00  0.50  0.00  0.04  0.02  0.03  0.05  0.34  0.01  0.01  1.00 \nNon-\n0.00  0.03  0.22  0.62  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.01  0.11  0.01  1.00 \nAgriculture \nUrban Labor  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.43  0.54  0.00  0.00  0.01  0.01  1.00 \nRural Labor  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.31  0.67  0.00  0.01  0.00  0.00  1.00 \nTransfers  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.05  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.95  1.00 \nUrban \n0.00  0.14  0.09  0.23  0.15  0.17  0.01  0.06  0.05  0.10  1.00 \nDiversified \nRural \n0.00  0.17  0.13  0.20  0.10  0.18  0.01  0.10  0.05  0.05  1.00 \nDiversified \nLao PDR: US$2/day \nAgriculture  0.21  0.54  0.00  0.01  0.02  0.01  0.02  0.15  0.01  0.01  1.00 \nNon-\n0.00  0.02  0.26  0.38  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.34  0.01  1.00 \nAgriculture \nUrban Labor  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.03  0.55  0.42  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  1.00 \nRural Labor  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.67  0.33  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  1.00 \nTransfers  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  1.00  1.00 \nUrban \n0.08  0.12  0.11  0.18  0.18  0.14  0.00  0.02  0.15  0.02  1.00 \nDiversified \nRural \n0.12  0.23  0.00  0.16  0.14  0.11  0.01  0.06  0.10  0.08  1.00 \nDiversified \n5.2  Poverty Arc Elasticity \nPoverty elasticity is usually computed by shocking income by one percent and calculating \nthe change in poverty. However, if there is a gap between income levels at the poverty line \nand the households\u2019 income below such a level, then such an approach may understate \n7 ", "ADBI Working Paper 141    Komoto and Stone \n \nactual poverty impacts. Taking the arc elasticity solves this problem by focusing on the \nchanges in the neighborhood of the poverty line, and increasing the range over which \nimpacts can be measured. Arc elasticity is obtained by computing the change in poverty \nheadcount with respect to the change in the real income of households around the poverty \nline; this can be approximated by the following formula:  \ndF (yp)/dyp\nE = \u2212 cs c cs  \ncs F (yp)/ yp\ncs c cs\nwhere F (yp)is the cumulative distribution function that computes poverty headcount ratio \ncs s\nwhen ypis the poverty income level in country c.  \nc\nLining up the stratum population from poorest to richest, poverty arc elasticities can be \ncomputed directly off the slope of the cumulative distribution function in the neighborhood of \nthe poverty line (Hertel ,et.al, 2007a). For example, 48% of the population in the Agriculture \nstratum in Cambodia falls within 5% (above and below) of the US$1/day poverty level. A \n32% change in income results in a 21% decrease in the poverty headcount, implying a \npoverty elasticity of -0.64 (Table 5). The table also shows that, as expected, elasticities \ndiminish from US$1/day to US$2/day as the density of poor households around the poverty \nline increases. This trend is more prevalent in Cambodia than in Lao PDR. \nTable 5: Poverty Elasticities Using the 10% of Stratum Population,  \nper stratum and country \nPoverty count  Poverty count  Percent change  Percent \nPoverty arc \nStrata  below poverty  above poverty  in poverty  change in \nelasticity \nline  line  headcount  income \nCambodia: US$1/day \nAgriculture  0.53  0.43  -0.21  0.32   -0.64  \nNon-Agriculture  0.21  0.11  -0.61  0.86   -0.71  \nUrban Labor  0.31  0.22  -0.38  0.61   -0.62  \nRural Labor  0.39  0.29  -0.29  0.53   -0.54  \nTransfers  0.82  0.71  -0.14  0.42   -0.33  \nUrban Diversified  0.23  0.13  -0.56  0.82   -0.68  \nRural Diversified  0.37  0.27  -0.31  0.49   -0.64  \nLao PDR: US$1/day \nAgriculture  0.40  0.30  -0.29  0.50   -0.58  \nNon-Agriculture  0.29  0.19  -0.42  0.92   -0.46  \nUrban Labor  0.26  0.16  -0.50  0.84   -0.59  \nRural Labor  0.32  0.20  -0.46  0.74   -0.62  \nTransfers  0.90  0.81  -0.11  0.61   -0.18  \nUrban Diversified  0.20  0.10  -0.67  0.96   -0.70  \nRural Diversified  0.20  0.10  -0.67  0.94   -0.72  \nCambodia: US$2/day \nAgriculture  0.96  0.86  -0.11  0.26   -0.42  \nNon-Agriculture  0.65  0.55  -0.16  0.29   -0.57  \nUrban Labor  0.64  0.54  -0.17  0.35   -0.48  \nRural Labor  0.78  0.68  -0.13  0.30   -0.45  \nTransfers  0.92  0.82  -0.12  0.58   -0.21  \nUrban Diversified  0.62  0.52  -0.17  0.32   -0.55  \nRural Diversified  0.84  0.74  -0.13  0.26   -0.49  \nLao PDR: US$2/day \nAgriculture  0.87  0.79  -0.10  0.23   -0.44  \nNon-Agriculture  0.53  0.48  -0.11  0.25   -0.43  \nUrban Labor  0.76  0.68  -0.10  0.20   -0.52  \nRural Labor  0.68  0.60  -0.13  0.36   -0.34  \nTransfers  0.95  0.86  -0.11  0.78   -0.13  \nUrban Diversified  0.57  0.51  -0.10  0.18   -0.54  \nRural Diversified  0.66  0.60  -0.10  0.18   -0.55  \n \n8 ", "ADBI Working Paper 141    Komoto and Stone \n \n6.  POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nKnowing the number of people who actually move out of poverty is helpful for any policy \ninitiative. However, it is the variation among the different income groups that informs the \nentire policy process, and can most effectively assist in designing programs that seek  to \npermanently alleviate poverty. This information can also highlight which groups need special \nattention, and provide guidance on what kind of assistance may be most appropriate. \nAs Table 5 shows, different income groups exhibit varying levels of sensitivity to changes in \nincome. For instance, Cambodia\u2019s non-agricultural workers and Lao PDR\u2019s rural diversified \nworkers earning US$1/day or less show the highest sensitivity to income changes. This is to \nbe expected, as these groups are often made up of casual and/or seasonal workers. Policies \naimed at permanent reductions in poverty may be directed at providing more stable market \nconditions to create more permanent work opportunities. In contrast, and not surprisingly, all \ngroups receiving transfer payments have the least sensitivity to income changes, showing \nthat there has been an historical reliance on this source of income. It also implies that, given \nthe recent decline in remittances, households that rely heavily on transfer payments may \nexperience greater perceptions of hardship,  if they lose this dependable flow of funds; \nmoving this particular group out of poverty may not be easy. \nLooking across these groups (US$1/day versus US$2/day) it is the rural workers in Lao PDR \nand the agricultural workers in Cambodia that  experience the largest changes. In Lao PDR, \nfor instance, for every 1% increase in income at the US$1/day level, there is a 0.62% decline \nin the number of rural laborers in poverty. However, at US$2/day, the number is almost half \nthat amount, at 0.34%. Thus, policies that impact on the income of the very poor may be \nmore effective for rural laborers in terms of absolute numbers moved out of poverty than, \nsay, for non-agriculture workers. The number of rural laborers at the US$2/day level is going \nto be more difficult to change. This implies the need  for long term support for this group, and \na mechanism to provide for lasting change.  \nIn Cambodia, the differences in elasticity across the US$1/day and US$2/day level are larger \nacross the board, with rural workers in general (laborers and diversified) seeing the biggest \ndifference. Thus, the impacts of changes in income between these two groups are more \nsevere in Cambodia, implying the possibility of having a larger, more entrenched group of \nworking poor. \n7.  CONCLUSIONS \nThe paper has shown that by using household survey data, more precise measures of the \npoverty impacts of various programs can be obtained. This methodology allows information \nfrom the Lao People\u2019s Democratic republic (PDR) and Cambodian household surveys to be \nmade  consistent  with  the  outputs  of  the  GTAP  general  equilibrium  model,  providing  a \nconsistent platform for translating policy changes to changes in poverty headcount across \nincome  strata.  Thus,  changes  in  sector  outcomes  arising  from  policy  reforms  or  major \ninvestments  (such  as  infrastructure  projects)  can  be  traced  through  changes  in  factor \nincomes. From there, a connection can be drawn between improvements in sector-specific \noutcomes and movements of people in and out of poverty. Governments need to understand \nthat different segments of the poor require specific programs, if the goal is to permanently \nmove people out of poverty. Governments must be in a position to anticipate the differential \nimpacts  of  any  given  policy,  and  respond  accordingly.  Given  the  constraints  on  fiscal \nbudgets, the information outlined in this paper should provide much needed guidance and \nfeedback for more effective policy design. \n9 ", "ADBI Working Paper
