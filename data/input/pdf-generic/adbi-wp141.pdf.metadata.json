However, policy changes may have varying consequences \nacross  different  segments  of  the  poor.  To  more  accurately  determine  the  poverty \nimplications  of  policy  initiatives,  it  is  important  to  stratify  households  according  to  income \nsource and decompose their factor earnings.  \n\nThis paper applies a method that builds consistency between information in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (PDR)  and  Cambodian  household  surveys,  and  the  outputs  of  the \ngeneral equilibrium model developed at the Global Trade Analysis Project, or GTAP model. \nThis  allows  for  a  consistent  platform  for  translating  policy  changes  to  changes  in  poverty \nheadcount  across  income  strata.  Thus,  changes  in  sector  outcomes  arising  from  policy \nreforms  or  major  investments  (such  as  infrastructure  projects)  can  be  traced  through \nchanges in factor incomes. From there, a connection can be drawn between improvements \nin  sector-specific  outcomes  and  movements  of  people  in  and  out  of  poverty.  As  such,  this \nmethod will help ensure effective policy design when the objective is poverty reduction. This \nmethod can be readily extended to other developing countries\u2019 survey data. \n\n \n \nJEL Classification: I32, O2 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\nIntroduction .................................................................................................................. 1 \n\n\u201cCleaning\u201d the Household Datasets ............................................................................ 2 \n\nLinking Reported Income to the GTAP Primary Factors ............................................. 4 \n\nStrengths and Weaknesses ........................................................................................ 5 \n\nStructure of Poverty ..................................................................................................... 6 \n\n5.1 \n5.2 \n\nEarnings Share at the Poverty Line ................................................................. 7 \nPoverty Arc Elasticity ....................................................................................... 7 \n\nPolicy Implications ....................................................................................................... 9 \n\nConclusions ................................................................................................................. 9 \n\nAppendix 1: Codes in the Cambodia dataset ........................................................................ 10 \n\nAppendix 2: Codes in Lao PDR Dataset ............................................................................... 16 \n\nReferences ............................................................................................................................ 21 \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\nThe current economic crisis has heightened concerns about poverty across the world. One \noutcome  of  the  recent  Group  of  Twenty  (G-20)  meeting  in  London  was  a  call  for  all \ndeveloped countries to fulfill their commitments on providing aid and continued development \nassistance  to  the  developing  world.  Indeed,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  recently \nreceived a 200% General Capital Increase, while announcing a US$3 billion counter-cyclical \nsupport facility for the region.  \n\nThe extent to which these measures will offset the major economic slowdown in the region \nremains  unclear.  The  full  extent  of  the  slowdown\u2019s  impacts  on  the  poor  is  also  as  yet \nunknown, but ADB is projecting an additional 131 million poor in 2010 (ADB 2009).  \n\nWhile  poverty  reduction  remains  a  major  pillar  in  the  development  agendas  of  multilateral \ndevelopment banks, the current economic situation has placed increased stress on available \nresources. Not only are donor countries experiencing pressure at home to prop up their own \neconomies,  traditional  aid  agencies  and  domestic  governments  alike  are  also  facing \nincreasing, and  increasingly  diverse,  demands  for  funds.  Rarely  has  the  need  to maximize \nvalue for every public dollar spent been more important. \n\nDespite the significant inroads made in the region, poverty is still a major challenge in Asia. \nWhile  cases  of  extreme  poverty  (i.e.  those  living  on  US$1/day  or  less)  have  fallen,  the \nnumber of those living at or near the poverty line of US$2/day remains high. Along with the \nrise  in  the  number  of  \u2018working  poor\u2019  has  come  a  rise  in  income  inequality.  Indeed,  studies \nhave shown increasing levels of income inequality over the last ten years in Asia (Ali 2008).   \n\nThese  trends  have  not  been  lost  on  policymakers.  \u201cEquitable  growth\u201d  and  \u201cholistic  growth\u201d \nhave become the new catchwords in development policy formulation. Large economies such \nas  India  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  have  instituted  a number  of  policies  to \naddress  the  potentially  destabilizing  effects  of  the  over-concentration  of  benefits  within \nparticular groups in society (Ganguly 2009). \n\nThe ultimate distribution of benefits from policy or public spending is pivotal for a number of \nreasons.  First,  from  a  strictly  economic  sense,  as  the  number  of  consumers  grows,  so  do \nopportunities  for  market  expansion  and  competition.  This  allows  companies  to  reap  the \nbenefits  of  economies  of  scale  and  scope.  Economies  that  support  competitive  markets \nenjoy  greater  innovation  and  increase  consumer  utility  by  widening  product  choice  and \nservice provision. Second, from a social policy perspective, a policy that has limited impacts \non income can lead to uneven income growth. This, in turn, can lead to social unrest and the \ndevelopment  of  a  permanent  underclass.  Aside  from  raising  moral  dilemmas,  these \noutcomes  represent  real  burdens  on  government  budgets.  Expanding  the  potential  gains \nfrom  any  development  project  can  ease  such  pressures  on  government  budgets,  while \nsimultaneously expanding the tax base. Thus, it is imperative that policymakers understand \nand anticipate the potential income effects of public spending or policy initiatives, and plan \naccordingly. \n\nThis  paper  outlines  one  way  of  measuring  the  impact  of  policy  initiatives  on  the  poor.  The \nuse  of  the  poverty  headcount  to  measure  poverty  impact  is  well  established  (Bourguignon \n2003;  Ravallion  and  Dat  1999;  Ravallion  and  Chen  1997).  However,  this  approach  usually \nmeasures  the  impact  of  policy  on  the  poor  in  general,  and  not  on  specific  groups.  The \nconsequences of policy reforms vary widely among various household segments, depending \non  their  primary  source  of  income,  endowment,  and  consumption  patterns.  Therefore,  it  is \nimportant  to  stratify  households  according  to  income  source  and  decompose  their  factor \nearnings, when attempting to determine the actual impact of policy measures. This can be \ndone  by  calculating  the  effects  of  changes  in  the  factor  earnings  on  poverty  headcount \nacross strata (Hertel et al. 2007a).  \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\n \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\nIn order to measure the impacts of various transport policy initiatives in Cambodia and Lao \nPDR,  households  were  stratified  according  to  primary  income  source.  Five  groups  of \nhouseholds that rely almost solely (95% or more) on one source of income were identified. \nThe households that rely on several sources of income (less than 95% on each source) were \nclassified as diversified, and further broken down into rural and urban households. In total, \nthere  are  seven  strata:  self  employed  agriculture  based,  self-employed  non-agriculture \nbased, rural and urban wage earners, transfer-based, and rural and urban diversified (Hertel \net al. 2007a).  \n\n(AgSkl);  Non-agriculture-Unskilled \n\nIncome  earned  by  households  in  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR  was  taken  from  household \nsurveys  and  categorized  into  ten  factor  income  sources:  Land,  Agriculture-Unskilled \n(AgUnskl);  Agriculture-  Skilled \n(NagUnskl);  Non-\nAgriculture-Skilled  (NagSkl);  Wage-Unskilled  (WgUnskl);  Wage-Skilled  (WgSkl);  Agriculture \nCapital  (Agcap);  Non-Agriculture-Capital  (Nagcap);  and  Transfers.  AgUnskl  and  AgSkl  are \nimputed  returns  to  self-employed  agriculture  labor.  NagUnskl  and  NagSkl  are  imputed \nreturns  to  self-employed  non-agriculture  labor.  WgUnskl  and  WgSkl  are  labor  wages  that \nwere  reported  directly  in  the  survey  as  wage  earnings.  Land  and  Agcap  are  split  from  the \nresidual  of  agriculture  profits  and  determined  by  alpha  (as  derived  from  the  Global  Trade \nAnalysis Project [GTAP] database). Nagcap is the residual of non-agriculture profits. Finally, \ntransfers include both public and private transfers (Hertel et al. 2007a).  \n\nThe  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  II  outlines  the  data  cleaning \nprocedure;  Section  III  describes  how  the  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR  household  data  were \nlinked to the GTAP data; and Section IV briefly discusses the methodology\u2019s strengths and \nweaknesses.  The  succeeding  sections  illustrate  the  structure  of  poverty  around  the \nneighborhood  of  the  poverty  line,  and  provide  some  policy  implications.  The  last  section \nconcludes.   \n\n2.  \u201cCLEANING\u201d THE HOUSEHOLD DATASETS \n\nThis paper uses the Cambodia Household Socio-Economic Survey from 2003 to 2004 and \nthe Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS III) from 2002 to 2003. The Cambodia \nsurvey  includes  all  24  provinces,  from  which  900  villages  (6.3%)  were  selected,  with \nprobability  proportional \nto  size.  The  Cambodia  survey  covers  household  socio- \ndemographics  such  as  age,  educational  attainment,  occupation,  industry,  sector,  and \npossession  of  durable  goods.  It  also  contains  household  income,  household  consumption, \ncrop production, and household expenditure, time use, as well as social indicators such as \nhealth,  fertility,  HIV/AIDS, 1   migration,  and  victims  of  violence.  LECS  III\u2019s  sampling  frame \ncomprises  all  18  provinces,  from  which  540  villages  (5%)  were  sampled  with  probability \nproportional  to  size  (i.e.,  number  of  villages  per  province).  LECS  includes  the  following \nvariables:  age,  educational  attainment,  industry,  sector,  possession  of  durable  goods,  time \nuse,  household \nincome,  household  consumption,  crop  production,  and  household \nexpenditure, as well as social indicators such as health and infrastructure.2 \n\nBoth datasets were \u201ccleaned\u201d using the following procedure:  \n\na.  Observations with missing socio-demographic variables and household \nincome were deleted, as there were no relevant information on which to \nbase the imputation of values. The Cambodia dataset initially consisted \nof 14,984 households, but 11 households were deleted; therefore, only \n14,973  households  were  used.  As  for  Lao  PDR,  only  one  respondent \nwas deleted, leaving 7,998 households for analysis. \n\n                                                 \n1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome \n2 Details of the Cambodian survey are included as Appendix 1 and those for Lao PDR as Appendix 2. \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\n \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\nb.  Units  of  analysis  across  these  spreadsheets  were  standardized  at  the \nhousehold level. Some variables reported by all household members\u2014\nsuch as wage, outputs, expenses, profits, property rents, dividends, and \ntransfers\u2014were  thus  aggregated  into  a  single  value  representing  the \nwhole household.  \n\nc.  Wages were imputed to self-employed income using the mean wage of \nrespondents  with  the  same  set  of  characteristics  (including  age, \neducation, skill, and industry of employment). For observations that did \nnot  match,  education  and  industry  were  aggregated  into  larger \nclassifications  (Tables  A1.3,  A1.4,  and  A2.2).  To  illustrate,  wages  of \nemployed  respondents  who  were  reported  as  18  years  old,  seventh \ngrader,  unskilled,  and  farmers  could  not  be  used  to  impute  wages  for \nself-employed  respondents  who  had  similar  characteristics\u2014i.e.,  18 \nyears old, unskilled and farmer, but were eighth graders. To remedy this, \nall  respondents  who  finished  sixth  to  eighth  grade  were  collapsed  into \none category called lower secondary; this allowed a match between self \nemployed respondents and wage earners who possessed a similar set \nof characteristics: 18 years old, unskilled, farmers, and lower secondary \n(that is, either sixth, seventh, or eighth graders). This procedure greatly \nincreased the number of matched respondents. \n\nd.  Some  missing  industry  data  were  filled  using  the  information  or  clues \nprovided  by  occupation.  For  example,  for  some  respondents  whose \noccupations were salespersons or security guards, it was assumed that \nthe corresponding industry is services.  \n\ne.  One  concern  about  the  Lao  PDR  dataset  was  that  respondents  were \nclassified  into  agriculture  and  non-agriculture  workers,  but  were  not \ncategorized  as  employed  or  self-employed.  To  separate  the  employed \nfrom  the  self  employed  among  the  non-agriculture  workers,  the \nfollowing  approach  was  taken:  based  on  the  responses  of  the \nhousehold-head  to  questions  about  family  business,  if  a  household \nowned  a  non-agriculture  business,  then  he  or  she  was  self-employed. \nAlso,  if  the  other  household  members  worked  in  the  same  industry  as \nthe  household  head,  then  they  were  assumed  to  be  working  in  the \nfamily business, and classified as self-employed. Among the agriculture \nworkers,  based  on  the  household  heads\u2019  responses  to  agriculture \nbusiness-related  questions \nif  a  household \noperated  its  own  agriculture  business,  then  he  or  she  was  considered \nself-employed.  Households  that  did  not  run  their  own  farm  business \nwere assumed to be employed by other people who ran an agricultural \nbusiness.  \n\nthe  questionnaire, \n\nin \n\nf.  For  Cambodia,  occupation  was  used  to  determine  the  skill  level  for \neach  income  category.  However,  the  Lao  PDR  dataset  did  not  report \noccupation.  Thus,  education  (Table  A2.2)  was  used  as  proxy  indicator \nfor  skill  in  the  Lao  PDR  data,  since  studies  have  shown  that  workers\u2019 \nproductivity  or  skill  depends  both  on  years  of  education  and  what  is \nlearned  at  school  (Heckman,  Layne-Farrar,  and  Todd  1995;  Murnane, \nWillett,  and  Levy  1995  in  Fasih  2008).  Ninth  graders  and  above  were \nconsidered skilled, and the rest were categorized as unskilled.  \n\ng.  Finally,  for  the  Lao  PDR  dataset,  90%  of  crop  price  data  were  taken \nfrom  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  Statistics  (FAOSTAT) \ndatabase.  \n\n3 \n\n\f \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\n3.  LINKING REPORTED INCOME TO THE GTAP PRIMARY \n\nADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\nFACTORS \n\nHousehold  income  was  linked  to  the  GTAP  factors  following  the  methodology  in  Ivanic \n(2004): \n\nAssumption  1,  Wage  labor:  Wages  are  received  by  employed  household  members,  not  by \nemployers,  or  the  self-employed.  These  include  cash  and  in  kind  (with  reported  cost \nestimates provided in the respective questionnaire). \n\nAssumption  2,  Skilled  labor:  Reported  and  imputed  wages  were  classified  based  on  a \nperson\u2019s  skill  level  as  either  skilled  or  unskilled.  For  Cambodia,  GTAP\u2019s  definition  was \nfollowed:  all  professional  workers  and  managers  were  classified  as  skilled;  unskilled \notherwise. For Lao PDR, education was used as proxy (as described above). \n\nAssumption 3, Transfers: Transfers include both government and private transfers. \n\nAssumption  4,  Property  rents:  Property  rents  are  either  agriculture  or  non-agriculture \nproperty  rents.  Agricultural  property  rents  include  rental  payments  for  land,  farming \nequipment, and other agricultural instruments. Non-agricultural property rents include rental \npayments for buildings, houses, non-agricultural equipment, and non-agricultural dividends. \nIn  the  Cambodia  dataset,  agricultural  property  rents  include  rental  payments  for  land  and \nponds, while non-agricultural property rents include dividends and rental payments for house \nand  building  space.  In  the  Lao  dataset,  agricultural  property  rents  include  rental  payments \nfor  land,  while  non-agricultural  property  rents  include  dividends  and  rental  payments  for \nhouse and building space.  \n\nAssumption 5, Agriculture vs. non-agriculture: Based on the definition in the Cambodia and \nLao PDR questionnaires, farming, livestock, fishing, and forestry are considered agricultural, \nwhile mining, services, and manufacturing are non-agricultural. \n\nAssumption  6,  Imputation  of  capital:  The  value  of  capital  is  the  residual  of  the  reported \nbusiness income less the estimated return to labor. This applies to both agriculture and non-\nagriculture sector. \n\nAssumption  7,  Estimated  returns  to  labor:  The  imputed  labor  income  for  all  household \nmembers involved in the business. The imputed labor income for a household member was \ndetermined as the average wage of all workers in the survey dataset that: (i) earned wage \nincome  only;  and  (ii)  possessed  an  identical  set  of  personal  characteristics,  i.e.,  age, \neducation level, skill level, and industry of employment.  \n\nAssumption 8, Returns to Land: The value of returns to land is the GTAP-determined fixed \nratio of capital returns in agriculture. Returns to land and capital were split from the sum of \nagricultural property rents and the residual of reported business income and imputed wage, \nusing the factor payment shares from the GTAP database derived from econometric studies \nof  cost  shares  in  agriculture  (Hertel,  Ivanic,  and  Cranfield.  2004).  For  Asia,  alpha  is  .88 \n(Table 1). \n\nAssumption  9:  Following  the  definition  of  business  income  in  Ivanic  (2004),  agricultural \nbusiness income includes imputed agricultural wage, returns to capital, and returns to land, \nwhile  non-agricultural  business  income  contains  imputed  non-agricultural  wage,  non-\nagricultural  capital,  and  non-agricultural  property  income.  Total  household  income  includes \nall sources of household income; that is, the sum of all factor income: Agskl, AgUskl, Nagskl, \nNagUskl, Wgeskl, WgeUskl, Agcap, Land, Nagcap, and Transfers.  \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\n \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\nTable 1: Definition of Factor Income \n\nFactor return \n\nAgri Skilled labor \nAgri Unskilled labor \nNon-Agri Skilled labor \nNon-Agri Unskilled labor \nWage Skilled labor \nWage Unskilled labor \nAgri capital \n\nNon-agri capital \n\nLand \n\nTransfers \n\nDefinition \n\nImputed agri skilled labor \nImputed agri unskilled labor \nImputed non-agri skilled labor \nImputed non-agri unskilled labor \nskilled labor wages \nUnskilled labor wages \nMax(0,(1-\u03b1)((ba -\n\naw )+pa)) \n\nnw )+pn) \n\nMax(0,((bn -\nMax(0,(\u03b1( (ba -\nPrivate transfers + public transfers \n\naw )+pa)) \n\n* \u03b1= 88%; ba =agricultural business income; bn =non-agricultural business income; \nnw =imputed non-agriculture labor; pa = agricultural property rent; pn = non-agricultural property rent.  \n\naw =imputed agriculture labor; \n\nTable  2  is  a  revised  version  of  the  example  in  Ivanic  (2004)  of  how  business  income  is \nbroken down, following the formulas in Table 1. For example, if a household reported a total \nof  US$100  of  agricultural  business  income,  of  which  US$60  is  imputed  labor  income  from \nagricultural  activities,  profit  is  equal  to  US$100  less  imputed  wage;  that  is,  US$40.  The \ncombined return to land and capital is equal to the profit plus reported property income. To \nobtain  the  returns  to  land,  multiply  this  figure  (US$70)  with  the  GTAP  determined  alpha, \n88%.  In  the  non-agricultural  business,  the  return  to  capital  would  be  zero,  as  the  imputed \nwage is equal to reported business income.  \n\nTable 2: Breakdown of Business Income \n\nAgricultural business \nincome \n60 +40 =100 \n\nNon-agricultural business \nincome \n60+0=60 \n\n \n\na) Reported business \nincome \nb) imputed wage \nc) residual (a-b) \nd) reported property income  30 \ne) land +capital (c+d) \nf) returns to land \ng) returns to capital \n\n30+ 40 \n70\u03b1 \n70(1-\u03b1) \n\n60 \n100-60 =40 \n\n60 \n60-60=0 \n30 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n4.  STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES \n\nWhile other poverty impact analysis methodologies like cross-section regressions show the \nimpact of policy reforms on general poverty, their results hide the specific gainers and losers \nof  such  reforms.  Applying  this  paper\u2019s  method,  GTAP  can  utilize  multi-poverty  elasticities \nwhich capture the shape of income distribution for specific subgroups from the survey data, \nand  thus  determine  the  mobility  and  distributional  welfare  of  these  subgroups  in  different \nsimulations (Hertel, Keeney, and Winters 2007b).  \n\nCompared  to  national  accounts  data,  survey  data  better  reflect  labor  force  classification \nwithout  significant  sampling  bias.  However,  the  real  size  of  economic  activities  may  be \nunderstated; some households may underreport their incomes, and it is likely that the richest \nhouseholds are underrepresented. To address this issue, Ivanic (2004) added the residual of \nthe GTAP totals and the survey factor returns to the survey data. It is important that surveys \nare properly designed in order to minimize the discrepancy.  \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\n \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\nImputation of labor income to self-employed individuals decreases the variance, as values in \nthis  variable  tend  to  lump  together  towards  the  mean.  In  order  to  better  capture  the  true \nvariability  across  labor  income  values,  future  household  surveys  can  include  questions  on \nthe actual income of household members who participate in the household business. Also, \nthis  methodology  can  be  improved  by  utilizing  surveys  that  have  better  coverage  than  the \nCambodia  (6.3%)  and  Lao  PDR  (5%)  surveys.  In  sum,  the  methodology  can  be  readily \nextended to other developing countries\u2019 survey data, provided that they have representative \ncoverage, sound sampling design, good quality, and timely data.  \n\n5.  STRUCTURE OF POVERTY \n\nThe entire population was characterized from poorest to richest. Applying the World Bank\u2019s \nUS$1  and  US$2  poverty  headcounts,  33.8%  (ADB  2007)  and  77.7%  (WDI  2007)  of  the \nCambodian households are below the US$1/day  and US$2/day poverty lines, respectively. \nAs  for  Lao  PDR,  28%  of  the  population  is  below  the  US$1  poverty  line  (ADB  2003);  while \n74% is below the US$2 poverty line (WDI 2007). These poverty lines apply to all subsequent \nprocedures in this paper. \n\nThe poverty income levels were taken back into the household strata to give an estimate of \nthe headcount by stratum. Cross-tabulation of the variables strata and households obtained \npoverty  rate  per  stratum,  poverty  headcount  share  in  total  poverty,  and  poverty  headcount \nshare in total population. Table 3 shows that in Cambodia, poverty is largely concentrated in \nthe  rural  diversified  followed  by  the  agriculture  sectors;  in  Lao  PDR,  the  poorest  are  in \nagriculture, followed by the rural diversified sectors. The frequency tables for occupation and \nindustry  in  the  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR  datasets  (Tables  A1.5  and  A2.3,  respectively) \nsubstantiate these figures. \n\nTable 3: Structure of Poverty Headcount by Earnings-Based Stratum and country \n(percent) \n\nIndicator \n\nAgriculture \n\nNon-\nAgriculture \n\nUrban  \nLabor \n\nRural  \nLabor \n\nTransfers \n\nUrban  \nDiversified \n\nRural  \nDiversified \n\nTotal \n\nCambodia: US$1/day \nPoverty rate in \nstratum \nShare in total \npoverty  \nShare in total \npopulation \nLao PDR: US$1/day \nPoverty rate in \nstratum \nShare in total \npoverty  \nShare in total \npopulation \nCambodia: US$2/day \nPoverty rate in \nstratum \nShare in total \npoverty  \nShare in total \npopulation \nLao PDR: US$2/day \nPoverty rate in \nstratum \nShare in total \npoverty  \nShare in total \npopulation \n\n48.5 \n\n39.3 \n\n13.3 \n\n34.81 \n\n77.03 \n\n21.56 \n\n90.7 \n\n32.0 \n\n24.9 \n\n82.76 \n\n69.27 \n\n51.25 \n\n23.94 \n\n20.74 \n\n28.00 \n\n85.71 \n\n15.06 \n\n14.84 \n\n28.0 \n\n16.3 \n\n26.6 \n\n34.2 \n\n76.3 \n\n17.8 \n\n3.2 \n\n1.1 \n\n2.0 \n\n0.7 \n\n2.1 \n\n0.7 \n\n1.1 \n\n0.4 \n\n4.02 \n\n1.13 \n\n1.25 \n\n0.31 \n\n0.35 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.80 \n\n0.23 \n\n59.9 \n\n59.4 \n\n72.6 \n\n86.8 \n\n57.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n4.0 \n\n1.9 \n\n1.5 \n\n1.9 \n\n1.5 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.4 \n\n31.8 \n\n46.1 \n\n15.6 \n\n33.8 \n\n100.0 \n\n33.8 \n\n11.22 \n\n100.0 \n\n3.14 \n\n28.0 \n\n78.8 \n\n49.8 \n\n38.7 \n\n77.7 \n\n100.0 \n\n77.7 \n\n50.53 \n\n71.85 \n\n64.00 \n\n90.48 \n\n54.20 \n\n62.92 \n\n74.0 \n\n3.21 \n\n2.38 \n\n1.64 \n\n0.27 \n\n1.21 \n\n0.20 \n\n0.32 \n\n0.24 \n\n17.98 \n\n100.0 \n\n13.30 \n\n74.0 \n\n6.3 \n\n2.1 \n\n5.36 \n\n1.50 \n\n8.8 \n\n6.8 \n\n7.30 \n\n5.40 \n\n6 \n\n\f0.27 \n\n0.05 \n\n0.19 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.17 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.05 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.05 \n\n1.00 \n\nADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\n \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\n5.1  Earnings Share at the Poverty Line \n\nSimilarly,  poverty  income  levels  were  taken  back  into  the  strata  to  estimate    the  average \nfactor income shares in total household income, in the neighborhood of the poverty line. This \nwas done by taking 10% of the population around the poverty line\u20145% below and 5% above \nthe poverty line\u2014for each stratum, and computing the average factor earnings shares in the \ntotal household income. To illustrate, 72% of the total income of the agriculture households \naround the US$1/day poverty line comes from unskilled agricultural labor, while for Lao PDR \nthe number is closer to 58%. The trends in Table 4 show that households depend highly on \n(imputed) unskilled labor income.  \n\nTable 4: Average Factor Income Shares Using 10% of Stratum HH around the Poverty \nLine, per Stratum and Country \n\nAg \nUnskl \n\nNag \nSkl \n\nNag \nUnskl \n\nLand \n\nTransfer \n\nTotal \n\nWg \nUnskl \n\n0.03 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.46 \n0.50 \n0.00 \n\n0.20 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.51 \n0.39 \n0.00 \n\n0.13 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.54 \n0.67 \n0.05 \n\n0.17 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.42 \n0.33 \n0.00 \n\n0.14 \n\nAg \nCap \n\n0.02 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.05 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.02 \n\n0.04 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.34 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.00 \n0.01 \n0.00 \n\n0.06 \n\n0.15 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.02 \n\nNag \nCap \n\n0.01 \n\n0.12 \n\n0.00 \n0.01 \n0.00 \n\n0.04 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.32 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.08 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.11 \n\n0.01 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.05 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.34 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.15 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.97 \n\n0.08 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n1.00 \n\n0.07 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.01 \n0.00 \n0.95 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n1.00 \n\n0.02 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n0.21 \n\n0.11 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.04 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.06 \n\n1.00 \n\n0.17 \n\n0.13 \n\n0.20 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.05 \n\n0.05 \n\n1.00 \n\nStrata \n\nAgSkl \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\nCambodia: US$1/day \nAgriculture \n0.00 \nNon-\nAgriculture \nUrban Labor \nRural Labor \nTransfers \nUrban \nDiversified \nRural \nDiversified \nLao PDR: US$1/day \nAgriculture \n0.23 \nNon-\nAgriculture \nUrban Labor \nRural Labor \nTransfers \nUrban \nDiversified \nRural \nDiversified \nCambodia: US$2/day \nAgriculture \n0.00 \nNon-\nAgriculture \nUrban Labor \nRural Labor \nTransfers \nUrban \nDiversified \nRural \nDiversified \nLao PDR: US$2/day \nAgriculture \n0.21 \nNon-\nAgriculture \nUrban Labor \nRural Labor \nTransfers \nUrban \nDiversified \nRural \nDiversified \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.08 \n\n0.12 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.12 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.72 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.19 \n\n0.07 \n\n0.58 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.33 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.15 \n\n0.50 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.54 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.12 \n\n0.11 \n\n0.04 \n\n0.85 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.19 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.32 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.04 \n\n0.62 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.23 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.38 \n\n0.03 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n0.18 \n\n5.2  Poverty Arc Elasticity \n\n0.23 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.11 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.06 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.08 \n\n1.00 \n\nPoverty  elasticity  is  usually  computed  by  shocking  income  by  one  percent  and  calculating \nthe change in poverty.

Taking  the  arc  elasticity  solves  this  problem  by  focusing  on  the \nchanges  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  poverty  line,  and  increasing  the  range  over  which \nimpacts  can  be  measured.  Arc  elasticity  is  obtained  by  computing  the  change  in  poverty \nheadcount with respect to the change in the real income of households around the poverty \nline; this can be approximated by the following formula:  \n\nE\n\ncs\n\n\u2212=\n\n(\ndF\ny\ncs\nyF\n(\ncs\n\np\nc\np\nc\n\n/)\n/)\n\ndy\np\ny\ncs\n\np\ncs\n\n \n\nwhere \n\nwhen \n\np\ns\n\n)\n\ncs yF\n(\np\ncy is the poverty income level in country c.  \n\nis the cumulative distribution function that computes poverty headcount ratio \n\nLining  up  the  stratum  population  from  poorest  to  richest,  poverty  arc  elasticities  can  be \ncomputed directly off the slope of the cumulative distribution function in the neighborhood of \nthe poverty line (Hertel ,et.al, 2007a). For example, 48% of the population in the Agriculture \nstratum  in  Cambodia  falls  within  5%  (above  and  below)  of  the  US$1/day  poverty  level.  A \n32%  change  in  income  results  in  a  21%  decrease  in  the  poverty  headcount,  implying  a \npoverty  elasticity  of  -0.64  (Table  5).  The  table  also  shows  that,  as  expected,  elasticities \ndiminish from US$1/day to US$2/day as the density of poor households around the poverty \nline increases. This trend is more prevalent in Cambodia than in Lao PDR. \n\nTable 5: Poverty Elasticities Using the 10% of Stratum Population,  \nper stratum and country \n\nPoverty count \nbelow poverty \nline \n\nPoverty count \nabove poverty \nline \n\nPercent change \nin poverty \nheadcount \n\nPercent \nchange in \nincome \n\nPoverty arc \nelasticity \n\nStrata \n\nCambodia: US$1/day \nAgriculture \nNon-Agriculture \nUrban Labor \nRural Labor \nTransfers \nUrban Diversified \nRural Diversified \nLao PDR: US$1/day \nAgriculture \nNon-Agriculture \nUrban Labor \nRural Labor \nTransfers \nUrban Diversified \nRural Diversified \nCambodia: US$2/day \nAgriculture \nNon-Agriculture \nUrban Labor \nRural Labor \nTransfers \nUrban Diversified \nRural Diversified \nLao PDR: US$2/day \nAgriculture \nNon-Agriculture \nUrban Labor \nRural Labor \nTransfers \nUrban Diversified \nRural Diversified \n\n0.53 \n0.21 \n0.31 \n0.39 \n0.82 \n0.23 \n0.37 \n\n0.40 \n0.29 \n0.26 \n0.32 \n0.90 \n0.20 \n0.20 \n\n0.96 \n0.65 \n0.64 \n0.78 \n0.92 \n0.62 \n0.84 \n\n0.87 \n0.53 \n0.76 \n0.68 \n0.95 \n0.57 \n0.66 \n\n \n\n-0.21 \n-0.61 \n-0.38 \n-0.29 \n-0.14 \n-0.56 \n-0.31 \n\n-0.29 \n-0.42 \n-0.50 \n-0.46 \n-0.11 \n-0.67 \n-0.67 \n\n-0.11 \n-0.16 \n-0.17 \n-0.13 \n-0.12 \n-0.17 \n-0.13 \n\n-0.10 \n-0.11 \n-0.10 \n-0.13 \n-0.11 \n-0.10 \n-0.10 \n\n0.32  \n0.86  \n0.61  \n0.53  \n0.42  \n0.82  \n0.49  \n\n0.50  \n0.92  \n0.84  \n0.74  \n0.61  \n0.96  \n0.94  \n\n0.26  \n0.29  \n0.35  \n0.30  \n0.58  \n0.32  \n0.26  \n\n0.23  \n0.25  \n0.20  \n0.36  \n0.78  \n0.18  \n0.18  \n\n-0.64  \n-0.71  \n-0.62  \n-0.54  \n-0.33  \n-0.68  \n-0.64  \n\n-0.58  \n-0.46  \n-0.59  \n-0.62  \n-0.18  \n-0.70  \n-0.72  \n\n-0.42  \n-0.57  \n-0.48  \n-0.45  \n-0.21  \n-0.55  \n-0.49  \n\n-0.44  \n-0.43  \n-0.52  \n-0.34  \n-0.13  \n-0.54  \n-0.55  \n\n0.43 \n0.11 \n0.22 \n0.29 \n0.71 \n0.13 \n0.27 \n\n0.30 \n0.19 \n0.16 \n0.20 \n0.81 \n0.10 \n0.10 \n\n0.86 \n0.55 \n0.54 \n0.68 \n0.82 \n0.52 \n0.74 \n\n0.79 \n0.48 \n0.68 \n0.60 \n0.86 \n0.51 \n0.60 \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 141 \n \n\n \n\nKomoto and Stone \n\n6.  POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nKnowing  the  number  of  people  who  actually  move  out  of  poverty  is  helpful  for  any  policy \ninitiative.  However,  it  is  the  variation  among  the  different  income  groups  that  informs  the \nentire  policy  process,  and  can  most  effectively  assist  in  designing  programs  that  seek    to \npermanently alleviate poverty. This information can also highlight which groups need special \nattention, and provide guidance on what kind of assistance may be most appropriate. \n\nAs Table 5 shows, different income groups exhibit varying levels of sensitivity to changes in \nincome. For instance, Cambodia\u2019s non-agricultural workers and Lao PDR\u2019s rural diversified \nworkers earning US$1/day or less show the highest sensitivity to income changes. This is to \nbe expected, as these groups are often made up of casual and/or seasonal workers. Policies \naimed at permanent reductions in poverty may be directed at providing more stable market \nconditions to create more permanent work opportunities. In contrast, and not surprisingly, all \ngroups  receiving  transfer  payments  have  the  least  sensitivity  to  income  changes,  showing \nthat there has been an historical reliance on this source of income. It also implies that, given \nthe  recent  decline  in  remittances,  households  that  rely  heavily  on  transfer  payments  may \nexperience  greater  perceptions  of  hardship,  if  they  lose  this  dependable  flow  of  funds; \nmoving this particular group out of poverty may not be easy. \n\nLooking across these groups (US$1/day versus US$2/day) it is the rural workers in Lao PDR \nand the agricultural workers in Cambodia that  experience the largest changes. In Lao PDR, \nfor instance, for every 1% increase in income at the US$1/day level, there is a 0.62% decline \nin the number of rural laborers in poverty. However, at US$2/day, the number is almost half \nthat  amount,  at  0.34%.  Thus,  policies  that  impact  on  the  income  of  the  very  poor  may  be \nmore  effective  for  rural  laborers  in  terms  of  absolute  numbers  moved  out  of  poverty  than, \nsay, for non-agriculture workers. The number of rural laborers at the US$2/day level is going \nto be more difficult to change. This implies the need  for long term support for this group, and \na mechanism to provide for lasting change.  \n\nIn Cambodia, the differences in elasticity across the US$1/day and US$2/day level are larger \nacross the board, with rural workers in general (laborers and diversified) seeing the biggest \ndifference.  Thus,  the  impacts  of  changes  in  income  between  these  two  groups  are  more \nsevere  in  Cambodia,  implying  the  possibility  of  having  a  larger,  more  entrenched  group  of \nworking poor. \n\n7.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe paper has shown that by using household survey data, more precise measures of the \npoverty impacts of various programs can be obtained. This methodology allows information \nfrom the Lao People\u2019s Democratic republic (PDR) and Cambodian household surveys to be \nmade  consistent  with  the  outputs  of  the  GTAP  general  equilibrium  model,  providing  a \nconsistent  platform  for  translating  policy  changes  to  changes  in  poverty  headcount  across \nincome  strata.  Thus,  changes  in  sector  outcomes  arising  from  policy  reforms  or  major \ninvestments  (such  as  infrastructure  projects)  can  be  traced  through  changes  in  factor \nincomes. From there, a connection can be drawn between improvements in sector-specific \noutcomes and movements of people in and out of poverty. Governments need to understand \nthat  different  segments  of  the  poor  require  specific  programs,  if  the  goal  is  to  permanently \nmove people out of poverty. Governments must be in a position to anticipate the differential \nimpacts  of  any  given  policy,  and  respond  accordingly.  Given  the  constraints  on  fiscal \nbudgets,  the  information  outlined  in  this  paper  should  provide  much  needed  guidance  and \nfeedback for more effective policy design. \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI

However, policy changes may have varying consequences \nacross  different  segments  of  the  poor.  To  more  accurately  determine  the  poverty \nimplications  of  policy  initiatives,  it  is  important  to  stratify  households  according  to  income \nsource and decompose their factor earnings.  \n", "This paper applies a method that builds consistency between information in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (PDR)  and  Cambodian  household  surveys,  and  the  outputs  of  the \ngeneral equilibrium model developed at the Global Trade Analysis Project, or GTAP model. \nThis  allows  for  a  consistent  platform  for  translating  policy  changes  to  changes  in  poverty \nheadcount  across  income  strata.  Thus,  changes  in  sector  outcomes  arising  from  policy \nreforms  or  major  investments  (such  as  infrastructure  projects)  can  be  traced  through \nchanges in factor incomes. From there, a connection can be drawn between improvements \nin  sector-specific  outcomes  and  movements  of  people  in  and  out  of  poverty.  As  such,  this \nmethod will help ensure effective policy design when the objective is poverty reduction. This \nmethod can be readily extended to other developing countries\u2019 survey data. \n", " \n \nJEL Classification: I32, O2 \n", " \n"]}
