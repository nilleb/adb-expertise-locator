In  the  model,  where  the  price  of  a  bitcoin  is  based  on  marginal \nproduction costs, successive positive demand shocks result in a rapidly increasing price path \nthat  may  be  mistaken  for  a  bubble.

And while it is a\n\ndigital currency, it cannot assume a value as do \u00d6at currencies, because no government has\n\ndeclared it to be legal tender. Bitcoin is most analogous to a commodity such as co\u00a7ee,\n\nwhich is produced by \u00ebsmall\u00ed farmers who are uncoordinated in their production decisions.\n\nWhile miners use electricity to produce bitcoins (instead of sunshine), the analogy is not\n\nfar-fetched, as evidenced by the fact that miners demonstrate a strong preference for joining\n\nmining pools,2 which are similar in structure to co\u00a7ee cooperatives since they are designed\n\nto share the risk among their members.3 Also, co\u00a7ee farmers once bene\u00d6ted from the now\n\ndefunct International Co\u00a7ee Agreement (ICA), which was a system of quotas that resulted\n\nin high and stable prices by organizing the supply of farmers worldwide.4 Encoded in the\n\nBitcoin protocol is a similar system of supply management that the Bitcoin network sustains\n\nby its near-perfect monitoring of the rate of block formation (and thus the quantity of bitcoins\n\nsupplied) and enforces by regular adjustments in the level of di\u00a2culty of mining a bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, however, has the additional feature of being a medium of exchange and a tradable\n\n1I follow the convention of capitalizing the word \u00ebbitcoin\u00ed when referring to the protocol or network and\n\nwriting it in lowercase when referring to the unit of currency.\n\n2According to hashrate distribution statistics provided by BTC.com, more than 95% of the Bitcoin\n\nnetwork hashrate for 2018 can be attributed to mining pools. See https://btc.com/stats/pool\n\n3Mining pools enable miners to decrease the variance of their returns by sharing their processing power\nover a network and splitting the reward according to the amount of work that each has contributed to the\nprobability of \u00d6nding a block.\n\n4The ICA was a quota system that was in operation between 1962 and 1989. The system was suspended\nbecause of failure to agree on the quota distribution and the increasing volume of co\u00a7ee traded with non-\nmember importing countries at lower prices. See Talbot (2004).\n\n2\n\n\fasset with numerous well-developed market exchanges, resulting in a unique class of asset\n\nwith characteristics that have never before been seen. I show that bitcoin\u00eds volatile price\n\npath and ine\u00a2ciency are related, as they both result from the protocol\u00eds system of supply\n\nmanagement.\n\nBitcoin, the \u00d6rst cryptocurrency, was invented by an unknown individual who imple-\n\nmented the software as open-source code. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are electronic\n\npayment systems that permit transactions to be made with pseudo-anonymity5 and without\n\nmiddlemen like banks. Bitcoin was launched on January 3, 2009. Until July 2010, the price\n\nof a bitcoin was less than 0.01 USD. By the beginning of 2017, the price had risen astound-\n\ningly to a stable 1,000 USD and it reached a peak value of 19,783 USD in December 2017.\n\nThe price has been generally falling since that time, with the exception of a few resurgences.\n\nBitcoin\u00eds price path is notoriously volatile and has evinced a multitude of boom-and-bust\n\ncycles over its 10-year lifespan. While there are numerous historical examples of bubbles,\n\nstarting as far back as the Dutch tulipmania (1634\u00f17),6 one is hard-pressed to identify an\n\nasset price or an episode of market exuberance that exempli\u00d6es the ceaseless de\u00e1ations and\n\nre-in\u00e1ations that are apparent in the price path of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.7\n\nIt is challenging to identify bubbles in market data because one needs to know an asset\u00eds\n\nfundamental value in order to identify a divergence between it and the asset\u00eds price. More-\n\nover, econometric tests of asset price bubbles do not do a good job of di\u00a7erentiating between\n\nmisspeci\u00d6ed fundamentals and bubbles (Gurkaynak, 2005).\n\nMining is the process by which bitcoins are created. Bitcoin miners use electricity to solve\n\ncomplex mathematical puzzles in order to verify the transactions added to the blockchain.\n\n5Bitcoin addresses are not tied to the identity of their users but since all transactions over the Bitcoin\nnetwork are completely transparent and traceable, multiple Bitcoin addresses can be clustered together and\nthen associated with a particular user. See Meiklejohn et al. (2013).\n\n6See Garber (1989; 1990) and Brunnermeier (2008) for a discussion of the history of price bubbles.\n7It is theoretically possible, however, for rational bubbles to periodically collapse to a small nonzero value\n\nand then to continue to increase. See Evans (1991).\n\n3\n\n\fSolving this \u00ebproof of work\u00ed (PoW) problem requires tremendous computational power and\n\nthe \u00d6rst miner to succeed (\u00d6nd a correct hash) is rewarded with new bitcoins.8 The Bitcoin\n\nprotocol speci\u00d6es a target that a correct hash must fall below, which implies a level of\n\ndi\u00a2culty for the computational problem. A lower target corresponds to a greater level of\n\ndi\u00a2culty because it is less likely that a hash will fall within the correct range. Changes\n\nin the target and hence the level of di\u00a2culty a\u00a7ect the rate of block formation because an\n\nincrease (decrease) in di\u00a2culty decreases (increases) the probability that a miner will \u00d6nd\n\na correct hash. Since the production of a block increases the supply of bitcoins according\n\nto the block reward,9 changes in the level of di\u00a2culty also determine the growth rate of the\n\nsupply of bitcoins over time.\n\nAlthough the Bitcoin network is managed by peer-to-peer technology without a central\n\nauthority, it uses the level of di\u00a2culty as an instrument to enforce an in\u00e1exible system of\n\nsupply management. The protocol regulates the quantity of bitcoins that are mined by\n\nadjusting the level of di\u00a2culty every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks). There\n\nis an interval of time between adjustments in the level of di\u00a2culty, so that the network can\n\naccurately estimate the waiting time to \u00d6nd a block. If the network detects that the time\n\nrequired to \u00d6nd the last 2016 blocks di\u00a7ers from 20,160 minutes, then the network uses the\n\nestimated mining rate to adjust the level of di\u00a2culty proportionally in order to target a\n\nten-minute interval between successive blocks mined. Only when the mining rate is equal to\n\nits target will the level of di\u00a2culty be unchanged.\n\nTo ascertain the value of a bitcoin, in Section 2 of the paper, I model the competitive\n\nbitcoin mining industry with free entry of miners in response to pro\u00d6ts that are created in\n\naccordance with the Bitcoin protocol. For simplicity, there is no secondary market for the\n\nbitcoin and all input markets are held constant. I de\u00d6ne the fundamental value of the bitcoin\n\n8The current block reward is 12.5 bitcoins.\n9The block reward decreases by one-half only every 210,000 blocks, or approximately four years. See\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply.\n\n4\n\n\fto be the marginal cost of producing a bitcoin when the mining rate is equal to its target.\n\nThis is a natural de\u00d6nition since the value of a bitcoin is governed by the protocol\u00eds system\n\nof supply management, and it is the unique price that is consistent with its rules. The\n\nmodel reveals that the fundamental value of a bitcoin is equal to the miners\u00ed equipment and\n\nelectricity costs, relative to their expected revenue (block reward and fees, multiplied by the\n\nexpected number of blocks mined). Also, the fundamental value of the bitcoin appreciates\n\nby an amount that is equal to the rate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty and, assuming a\n\nconstant-elasticity demand curve for bitcoin, the return on bitcoin is proportional to the rate\n\nof increase in the level of di\u00a2culty. I establish how adjustments of the level of di\u00a2culty in\n\nresponse to demand shocks result in exaggerated price movements that may be mistaken for\n\na bubble. The supply of bitcoins is upward sloping since a higher price of a bitcoin results\n\nin a greater number of entrants (miners), which increases the network hashrate and thus\n\nthe number of blocks mined per day. If a positive demand shock results in a mining rate\n\nthat exceeds its target, then the Bitcoin protocol will stipulate an increase in the level of\n\ndi\u00a2culty. I show that an increase in di\u00a2culty decreases the supply of bitcoins (it rotates\n\nthe supply curve upward) since it results in greater marginal electricity costs for the miners.\n\nThis causes an exaggerated upward price movement since the initial price increase caused\n\nby the demand shock is ampli\u00d6ed by the decrease in supply. Since the protocol aims at\n\nmaintaining a constant supply of bitcoins per day, prices are largely demand driven and thus\n\nvariations in demand are transformed by the process of adjusting the level of di\u00a2culty into\n\nprice volatility.\n\nInterestingly, if the increase in demand is due to the optimistic beliefs of investors regard-\n\ning the future price of bitcoins, the subsequent increase in di\u00a2culty will work to validate\n\ninvestor\u00eds beliefs, encouraging another round of optimism. While I do not model beliefs\n\nin this paper, it is intuitively clear how the protocol can interplay with investor\u00eds beliefs,\n\nresulting in the momentum of price movements over time: a greater demand for bitcoins\n\n5\n\n\fcauses higher bitcoin prices, which causes more miners to enter the industry, which results\n\nin a mining rate that exceeds its target, which leads to intervention by the protocol and a\n\nhigher level of di\u00a2culty, which causes greater than laissez-faire prices, which leads to greater\n\ndemand for bitcoins by investors... and so on, until an exogenous event breaks the cycle. The\n\nresulting sequence of positive demand shocks ampli\u00d6ed by increases in the level of di\u00a2culty\n\ncan result in an explosive price path that may be mistaken for a bubble despite being based\n\non marginal costs. The analysis of a negative demand shock is analogous: a series of negative\n\ndemand shocks may be mistaken for a bursting bubble since the equilibrium price will fall\n\nrapidly as the di\u00a2culty decreases. It follows that the economic functioning of the Bitcoin\n\nprotocol can result in boom-and-bust cycles in the price of the bitcoin. Unlike a bubble,\n\nhowever, the price is equal to marginal cost all the while.\n\nNext, I show that because the protocol intervenes in the market to control the supply of\n\nbitcoins, welfare losses must occur as a result. An increase in di\u00a2culty works analogously\n\nto a government\u00eds placing an ad valorem tax on the price of the bitcoin since the supply\n\nprice increases in proportion to the di\u00a2culty adjustment. Instead of accruing tax revenue,\n\nhowever, the increase in di\u00a2culty imposes additional electricity costs on the miners. While\n\na higher price for the bitcoin is obtained, the rents that would have arisen from limiting the\n\nsupply are wasted as they neither bene\u00d6t a government nor the miners. A decrease in the\n\nlevel of di\u00a2culty works analogously to a government that provides an ad valorem subsidy (a\n\nnegative tax) to the miners, but I show that the welfare e\u00a7ects of an increase in di\u00a2culty\n\nare not o\u00a7set by a decrease in di\u00a2culty by the same proportion since the absolute change\n\nin electricity costs is greater under the increase, and a distortion loss must be experienced\n\nunder either.\n\nIronically, while the bitcoin is esteemed for its nongovernmental design, it\n\nfollows that its system of supply management is far less e\u00a2cient than if a government were\n\nto regulate the quantity of bitcoins by imposing a tax on its price.\n\nBitcoin is a particularly advantageous choice of asset for studying price behavior since\n\n6\n\n\fthe protocol\u00eds rules are clearly stated and thus the functioning of the overall system is fully\n\ntransparent. Also, the entire population of data pertaining to the supply of bitcoins and\n\nhow the Bitcoin protocol is implemented over time are readily available from its blockchain\n\nledger.10\n\nI parse the Bitcoin blockchain to obtain time series data for the network level\n\nof di\u00a2culty, the number of blocks mined per day, the block reward and fees, and describe\n\nthe data in Section 3 along with data pertaining to bitcoin mining equipment speci\u00d6cations\n\nand costs, and the average USD market price of the bitcoin across major bitcoin exchanges.\n\nI examine model diagnostics and show that the data is largely consistent with the model\n\ndeveloped in Section 2.\n\nSince prices are typically well approximated by a random walk in the absence of bubbles\n\nbut are characterized by an explosive path during periods of bubbles, recent econometric\n\ntechniques identify rational speculative bubbles by testing for a mildly explosive departure\n\nfrom a random walk.11;12 Such tests were originally proposed by Phillips et al. (2011) and\n\nfurther developed by Phillips and Yu (2011), Homm and Breitung (2012), and Phillips et al.\n\n(2015a; 2015b). In Section 4, I outline the generalized version of the supremum augmented\n\nDickey\u00f1Fuller (GSADF) test based on Phillips et al. (2015a; 2015b), which delivers a con-\n\nsistent date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles, and\n\napply it to determine whether the boom-and-bust cycles evident in bitcoin price data can\n\nbe explained by the fundamentals derived in Section 2. I also apply the model developed in\n\nSection 2 to estimate the welfare losses that are due to adjustments in the level of di\u00a2culty\n\nthroughout the sample period. Since estimating welfare losses requires an estimate of the\n\nprice elasticity of demand for bitcoins, I exploit the timing of adjustments in the di\u00a2culty to\n\nisolate periods that are characterized by large supply shocks in order to identify the demand\n\n10The blockchain ledger also records all transactions between users with the exception of \u00ebo\u00a7-chain\u00ed trans-\n\nactions such as those occurring on bitcoin exchanges.\n\n11These tests can detect rational bubbles as well as other bubble-generating mechanisms, such as intrinsic\n\nbubbles, herd behavior and time-varying discount factor fundamentals.\n\n12For a survey of the literature on bubbles see Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2012).\n\n7\n\n\fcurve.\n\nI present the results in Section 5. I \u00d6nd that while the raw bitcoin price data demonstrates\n\nevidence of bubble formation, the residuals after \u00d6tting the price to the fundamental value as\n\nde\u00d6ned by the model do not. This provides strong evidence that the model can explain the\n\napparent bubbles since, after accounting for the protocol\u00eds di\u00a2culty adjustment mechanism,\n\nthe price path reverts to a random walk. I obtain an estimate for the total welfare losses\n\nfrom 17 March 2014 to 13 January 2019 of 323.82 million USD, which is about 9.3% of the\n\ntotal electricity costs to power the Bitcoin network during this time.\n\nSection 6 presents the conclusions.\n\nThere is a small but rapidly growing economics literature on the topic of Bitcoin and\n\ncryptocurrencies. The comprehensive empirical analysis conducted in Liu and Tsyvinski\n\n(2018) using price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple demonstrates that the mean and\n\nstandard deviation of returns for cryptocurrencies are an order of magnitude higher than\n\nthose for traditional asset classes. Also, with the exception of the exposure of Ethereum to\n\ngold, cryptocurrencies have no exposure to most common stock market and macroeconomic\n\nfactors, and their returns can be best predicted by two factors speci\u00d6c to their markets: mo-\n\nmentum and investor attention. Bianchi (2018) uses a large panel of prices, traded volumes,\n\nand market capitalization on 14 actively quoted cryptocurrencies to empirically investigate\n\ntheir relation with standard asset classes. The main empirical results suggest that, except\n\nfor a mild correlation with gold and crude oil, there is no signi\u00d6cant relation between returns\n\non cryptocurrencies and more traditional asset classes. Dong et al. (2018) \u00d6nd that bitcoin\n\nprice dynamics are signi\u00d6cantly sensitive to investor sentiment. The authors use sentiment\n\ndata to show that stricter regulations for Bitcoin predict a decrease in future returns and an\n\nincrease in the probability of a future price collapse, and that market sentiment positively\n\ncomoves with bitcoin prices.\n\nThese empirical studies characterize features of Bitcoin returns that are consistent with\n\n8\n\n\fthe main premise of this paper: the bitcoin is a tradable commodity whose supply is managed\n\nby the Bitcoin protocol, which creates an asset that is radically di\u00a7erent from those belonging\n\nto traditional asset classes. As discussed above, since the protocol uses a di\u00a2culty adjustment\n\nmechanism to target a constant supply of bitcoins per day, prices are in excess of their\n\nlaissez-faire counterparts and are demand driven. As such, it is intuitive that bitcoin returns\n\nare supernormal and volatile, and that prices are highly sensitive to investor attention and\n\nsentiment. Also, since the di\u00a2culty adjustment mechanism works to validate investor\u00eds\n\nbeliefs regarding future price movements, it is natural that the bitcoin price path would\n\ndemonstrate momentum. While Dong et al. (2018) attribute the price responses to bubbles,\n\nin this paper I show that it is the fundamental value of Bitcoin that manifests volatile and\n\npotentially explosive behavior due to the e\u00a7ect of di\u00a2culty adjustments on the miners\u00ed costs.\n\nThe papers most closely related to the present paper are Pagnotta and Buraschi (2018)\n\nand Easley et al. (2017). Pagnotta and Buraschi (2018) study the general equilibrium of a\n\ndecentralized \u00d6nancial network and derive closed-form solutions linking the bitcoin price to\n\nmarket fundamentals. The authors develop a theoretical model where the Bitcoin network\u00eds\n\nvalue is driven by the number of users and miners who provide computing resources that\n\na\u00a7ect the network\u00eds trustworthiness. They \u00d6nd that, counterintuitively, the price of the\n\nbitcoin decreases whenever the marginal cost of mining increases since it will induce miners\n\nto provide a lower hashrate, which reduces network trust and ultimately the equilibrium\n\nprice. Easley et al. (2017) develop a game theoretic model to explain the strategic behavior\n\nof miners and users, and demonstrate that equilibrium in the bitcoin blockchain is a complex\n\nbalancing of user and miner participation. The authors \u00d6nd that transaction fees play a\n\ncrucial role in in\u00e1uencing the stability of the blockchain and that higher transaction fees are\n\ndriven by the queuing problems facing users, rather than by reductions in block rewards.\n\nIn contrast with Pagnotta and Buraschi (2018), the present paper considers a relatively\n\nunstructured demand side of the bitcoin market, focusing instead on the supply-side e\u00a7ect\n\n9\n\n\fof the protocol. I treat network quality and security, in addition to speci\u00d6c use cases that\n\nare mostly unobservable, as exogenous factors that may drive the demand for bitcoins. The\n\nmodel in this paper predicts a positive relation between the rate of increase in the price of a\n\nbitcoin and the rate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty, a key determinant of the marginal cost\n\nof mining, and I show that this prediction is strongly supported by the data. While Easley et\n\nal. (2017) study how the Bitcoin protocol a\u00a7ects the interaction between miners and users,\n\nand thus the determination of fees, the present paper treats fees as exogenous and studies\n\nhow the protocol a\u00a7ects the interaction between the miners and the purchasers of bitcoins\n\n(who may either hold it or use it to make transactions), and thus the determination of the\n\nprice of the bitcoin in the market. By leveraging an understanding of the microeconomics of\n\nbitcoin production, the model sheds light on the sources of \u00e1uctuations in the price of the\n\nbitcoin.\n\n2 The model\n\nA miner must collect new transactions into a block and then hash the block header to form a\n\n256-bit block hash value. If the value is below a target set by the protocol, which corresponds\n\nto a given level of di\u00a2culty !, then other miners will con\u00d6rm the solution and agree that\n\nthe block can be added to the blockchain. Because the header contains a 32-bit nonce \u00d6eld\n\nwhose value is adjusted by the miners in an attempt to \u00d6nd an acceptable solution, the\n\nexpected number of hashes per second needed to \u00d6nd a solution is !232: It follows that the\n\nexpected waiting time for a miner to \u00d6nd a block (in seconds) is \"232\n\n#109 , where # is the hashrate\nemployed by the miner measured in gigahashes per second.13 When a miner \u00ebsolves a block,\u00ed\n\nthe miner earns the block reward !

It adjusts the di\u00a2culty in such a way that the current network hashrate\n\nresults in a ten-minute block interval.14 If the network detects that the time required to \u00d6nd\n\nthe last 2016 blocks di\u00a7ers from 20,160 minutes, which is a daily mining rate that di\u00a7ers\n\nfrom 144 blocks per day, then the level of di\u00a2culty will be adjusted as follows:\n\n!2\n!1\n\n=\n\n20; 160 minutes\nActual time of last 2016 blocks in minutes\n\n=\n\ndaily mining rate\n144\n\n(1)\n\nwhere !2 is the new level of di\u00a2culty and !1 is the previous level of di\u00a2culty.15\n\nIf, for\n\ninstance, the actual time of the last 2016 blocks was only 10,080 minutes (7 days), then since\n\nthe daily mining rate is 2016\n\n7 = 288; the network hashrate is such that twice as many blocks\n\nare mined per day relative to the objective of 144 blocks, so that !2 will be set twice as high\n\nas !1. Only when the average number of blocks discovered per day is equal to 144 will the\n\ndi\u00a2culty remain unchanged.\n\nI assume that there are identical potential entrants (miners) to the bitcoin mining in-\n\ndustry. Each miner is risk neutral, knows the rules of the Bitcoin protocol that govern the\n\nnetwork, and must pay a \u00d6xed cost F (thereafter sunk) to purchase mining equipment in\n\norder to enter.

It follows from (2) and (3) that a miner\u00eds\n\noperating pro\u00d6t is linear in )i and if the dollar price of a bitcoin (the exchange rate) pb >\n\n\"232(pe\n(!+f )(1000)602109 !\n\npb; then it is optimal the miner to set )i = 24 and 0 otherwise.\n\nSince hashing power scales linearly (doubling the number of miners doubles the network\n\nhashrate), the total hashpower of the Bitcoin network is #M; where M is the total number\n\nof miners who enter the industry. It follows that gross of investment costs, miners\u00ed aggregate\n\nexpected daily pro\u00d6ts are given by\n\npb (! + f ) 602109\n!232\n\n*pe\n1000\n\n\"\n\n* =\n\n!\n\n24#M\n\n\"\n\nwhere I assume pb > pb: Since\n\n1\n\"232 is the probability that a miner will \u00d6nd a correct hash,\n\nit is clear from (4) that mining is akin to a lottery: the payo\u00a7 from playing is uncertain\n\nwhile the cost of playing is not. Because an increase in the number of miners M increases\n\nthe network hashrate proportionally, each miner has the same expected pro\u00d6t +\n\nM regardless\n\nof the number of entrants. Every 2016 blocks, however, the level of di\u00a2culty ! is adjusted\n\nso that the average waiting time to \u00d6nd a block on the network is approximately 10 minutes\n\n(600 seconds), so that\n\n\"232\n#M 109 = 600 or\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n! =\n\n600#M 109\n232\n\n:\n\n12\n\n\fSince the target waiting time to \u00d6nd a block on the network in (5) is encoded in the protocol\n\nand known to the potential entrants, it pins down the number of miners M: From (4) and\n\n(5) it follows that the expected daily pro\u00d6t for a miner is\n\n. =\n\n/F\n\n*\nM \"\npb (! + f ) 602\n\n=\n\n!\n\n600#M \"\n\n*pe\n1000\n\n\"\n\n24#\n\n/F\n\n\"\n\nwhere / is the daily depreciation rate of the miner\u00eds equipment. Since there is free entry\n\nto the bitcoin mining industry, miners have zero expected pro\u00d6ts and hence the number of\n\nminers per day is given by . = 0 or\n\nFrom (7) it is clear that the number of miners is equal to the total size of the \u00ebpie\u00ed shared\n\namong the miners each day (the dollar value of the block reward and fees, for each of the\n\n144 possible blocks mined), divided by each miner\u00eds daily equipment and electricity costs\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nWhile the number of entrants adjusts immediately to changes in the price of a bitcoin pb;\n\nthe level of di\u00a2culty adjusts only approximately every two weeks while the network learns\n\nthe network hashrate #M ! from observing the average number of blocks mined per day (the\n\ndaily mining rate).

From (9) it follows that the supply curve is linear, because hashing power scales\n\nlinearly. Also, since the quantity supplied increases proportionally to the price, the price\n\nelasticity of supply is unity.\n\n16To demonstrate that XS is equal to the block reward multiplied by the daily mining rate, we can express\n\nXS of (9) as XS = !\n\n2016\n2016\n\n!232\n\"M ! 109 !\n\n1\n(24)602\n\n!\n\n= !\n\n2016 blocks\nActual tim e of last 2016 blocks in days :\n\n17It follows from (8) and (9) that, for a given price of a bitcoin pb, an increase in the miners\u00ed hashrate %\nresults in an increase in the daily electricity costs $%\n1000 (24) pe; which works to decrease the supply of bitcoins\nXS. Since an increase in % also increases the expected number of blocks solved per day on the network\n(24)602%109\n\u2019232\n\n; however, the net e\u00a7ect of an increase in % is to increase the supply of bitcoins XS:\n\n14\n\n\fSince the network\u00eds choice of the level of di\u00a2culty depends on the network hashrate #M !;\n\nthe equilibrium level of di\u00a2culty !! will depend on M !. Hence it follows from substituting\n\n(7) into (5) that the equilibrium level of di\u00a2culty is\n\n!! =\n\npb (! + f )\nh\n/F + #(\n\n(24)602#109\n232\n\n1000 (24) pe\n\n:\n\ni\n\n(10)\n\nFrom (10) it is clear that, for a given price of a bitcoin pb; the di\u00a2culty will increase in\n\nresponse to an increase in the hashrate of miners\u00ed equipment #; an improvement in the energy\n\ne\u00a2ciency of the miners\u00ed equipment (a decrease in *), a decrease in the price of electricity pe;\n\nor an increase in the Bitcoin block reward ! or fees f . It follows from (9) and (10) that we\n\ncan write XS = \"!\n\n\" X and hence XS = X if and only if ! = !!: In other words, in the interim\n\nbetween adjustments of the level of di\u00a2culty, the quantity of bitcoins supplied will not equal\n\nits target. Once the di\u00a2culty is adjusted according to (10), however, the protocol will be in\n\nequilibrium.18\n\nI assume that the daily demand for bitcoins by individuals who buy bitcoins in the market\n\nis given by the constant elasticity demand curve\n\nXD = 1p\"\nb\n\n\"\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the elasticity of demand is \" > 0: For simplicity, I assume that all bitcoins that have\n\nbeen previously purchased are either held or transferred to another user. While miners may\n\nalso hold or transfer the bitcoins they obtain from mining rather than selling them in the\n\nmarket, the market price establishes their opportunity cost of doing so.\n\nI de\u00d6ne a comprehensive equilibrium to be a four-tuple (X !; p!b; !!; M !) ; where the \u00d6rst\n\nelement is the equilibrium quantity of bitcoins supplied per day, the second element is the\n\n18As we will see in Section 3, Figure 8 shows that the number of blocks mined per day frequently di\u00a7ers\n\nfrom its target.\n\n15\n\n\fequilibrium price, the third element is the equilibrium level of di\u00a2culty and the fourth\n\nelement is the equilibrium number of miners per day, which determines the equilibrium\n\nhash rate. A comprehensive equilibrium is the unique solution to the system of equations\n\ndetermined by the zero pro\u00d6t condition obtained from setting (4) equal to miners\u00ed \u00d6xed\n\ncosts, the Bitcoin protocol\u00eds speci\u00d6ed waiting time to \u00d6nd a block of (5), the supply curve\n\nof (9) and the demand curve of (11).19 In a comprehensive equilibrium, since XS (p!b; !!) =\n\nXD (p!b) = X ! and XS = X if and only if ! = !!; it follows that X ! = X: We have seen\n\nthat since the level of di\u00a2culty ! is adjusted only at intervals, an equilibrium in the market\n\n(XS (p!b; !) = XD (p!b) = X !) may not happen at the same time as an equilibrium in the\n\nprotocol (! = !!; M = M !).\n\nFigure 1 depicts the aggregate daily supply of bitcoins by miners and the aggregate\n\ndaily demand for bitcoins by individuals. Starting from an initial comprehensive equilibrium\n\nlabeled 1 with price pb1; a level of output X1 = X; a mass of entrants M1, and a level\n\nof di\u00a2culty !1, an increase in demand from XD to X 0D leads to an increase in the price\n\nof a bitcoin to pb2 and a movement along the supply curve consistent with an increase\n\nin the number of entrants to M2. Because the probability of successfully mining a block\n\nis determined by !1 and more hashpower #M2 is directed at the network, the quantity of\n\nbitcoins supplied increases to X2 = XS (pb2; !1) per day in the market equilibrium labeled 2a.\n\nThe new equilibrium will be short-lived, however, since the mining rate exceeds the Bitcoin\n\nprotocol\u00eds target mining rate of 144 blocks per day.\n\nI assume that equilibrium 2a is representative of the daily mining rate during a 2016-block\n\nperiod. As such, the Bitcoin protocol will choose the new level of di\u00a2culty !2 = !! (pb2) : It\n\nfollows from XS of (9) and !! of (10) that the protocol will choose the new level of di\u00a2culty\n\n19See the preliminaries of the Appendix for a proof of the existence and uniqueness of a comprehensive\n\nequilibrium.\n\n16\n\n\f!2 in accordance with (1) since\n\n!2 =\n\npb2 (! + f )\nh\n/F + #(\n\n(24)602#109\n232\n\n1000 (24) pe\n\n= !1\n\ni\n\nXS (pb2; !1)\nX\n\n(12)\n\nand the daily mining and target mining rates are given by XS (pb2;\"1)\n\nand X\n\n!\n\n! = 144; respectively.\n\nIt follows from XS of (9) that the increase in the level of di\u00a2culty from !1 to !2 results\n\nin an upward rotation of the supply curve. Referring to Figure 1, the supply curve rotates\n\nupward until XS = X at the price pb2; since pb2 gives rise to the network hashrate #M2:\n\nThe marginal cost of mining has increased because the greater di\u00a2culty causes miners to\n\nexpend more resources on electricity to mine a given number of blocks. Since the price pb2\n\nis unchanged, it follows from (7) that an increase in di\u00a2culty does not result in an exit of\n\nminers from the industry.20 At the point labeled 2b, the protocol is in equilibrium since\n\nthe mining rate is equal to its target given the network hashrate #M2; and the network has\n\nno further incentive to change the level of di\u00a2culty. Since the protocol has no knowledge\n\nof the demand curve, however, 2b is not, in general, a market equilibrium. At 2b there is\n\nexcess demand, which causes the price of a bitcoin to rise to pb3 and the number of miners to\n\nincrease to M3: At the market equilibrium labeled 3 with price pb3, the demand X 0D is equal\n\nto the supply of bitcoins given the new level of di\u00a2culty !2: While the protocol is no longer\n\nin equilibrium, the mining rate is closer to its target than before the increase in di\u00a2culty.\n\nMore pertinently, however, since pb3 exceeds pb2; it is clear from Figure 1 that the decrease\n\nin supply due to the greater di\u00a2culty results in an exaggerated price response relative to the\n\nprice that would have prevailed had the di\u00a2culty not been adjusted. The resulting price,\n\nhowever, is fully supported by marginal costs since the price is equal to the marginal cost in\n\n20Recall that the number of miners adjusts immediately to changes in the price of a bitcoin pb; and then\n\nthe di\u00a2culty adjusts in turn.\n\n17\n\n\fthe new equilibrium labeled 3.\n\nFigure 1. Bitcoin price adjustment.\n\nFigure 2 depicts successive positive demand shocks and demonstrates that they result\n\nin a rapidly increasing price path that may be mistaken for a bubble despite being based\n\non marginal costs. While the increase in demand may be due to the optimistic beliefs of\n\ninvestors regarding the future price of bitcoins, the protocol will work to increase the level\n\nof di\u00a2culty correspondingly, validating investors\u00ed beliefs, and encouraging another round of\n\noptimism! The analysis of a negative demand shock is analogous and a series of negative\n\ndemand shocks may be mistaken for a bursting bubble since the equilibrium price will fall\n\nrapidly as the level of di\u00a2culty decreases.\n\nIt follows that the interaction of the Bitcoin\n\nprotocol with investors\u00ed beliefs can manifest as momentum and boom-and-bust cycles in the\n\n18\n\n\fprice of bitcoins. Unlike a bubble, however, price is equal to marginal cost all the while.\n\nFigure 2. Successive positive demand shocks.\n\nI de\u00d6ne the fundamental value pf\n\nb to be that price such that the protocol is in equilibrium.\n\nWhile the fundamental value is not necessarily equal to the market price of a bitcoin, it\n\nprovides an appropriate theoretical benchmark since it is the protocol that governs its value.\n\nFurthermore, as shown in Figure 3, if a demand shock is permanent, the market price will\n\napproach the fundamental value since successive adjustments of the di\u00a2culty will occur\n\nuntil the mining rate is equal to its target in the limiting comprehensive equilibrium. Given\n\nthat the market is competitive, the protocol is constantly maneuvering the market price\n\ntoward pf\n\nb ; a process that is only temporarily disrupted by shocks to demand. Since the\n\nfundamental value depends on the level of di\u00a2culty, it follows that the di\u00a7erence between\n\nthe market price and the fundamental value at a given point in time can be represented by a\n\nshift in demand that originated from a comprehensive equilibrium, along a constant supply\n\n19\n\n\fcurve. For instance, referring to Figure 1, the di\u00a7erence between the market price pb2 and\n\nthe fundamental value pb1 while ! = !1, is due to the demand shock while holding the supply\n\ncurve XS (!1) constant.\n\nFigure 3. Limiting bitcoin price adjustment.\n\nThe following proposition characterizes the bitcoin\u00eds fundamental value and uses it as a\n\nbenchmark to relate the return on bitcoins to the rate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty.\n\nProposition 1 (i) The fundamental value of a bitcoin pf\n\nb is equal to the miners\u00ed costs relative\n\nto their expected block reward and fees, and appreciates by an amount which is equal to the\n\nrate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty !. (ii) The market price of a bitcoin pb appreciates\n\nby an amount which is equal to 1\n\n1+\" times the rate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty !.\n\nProof. See the Appendix.\n\n20\n\n\fFrom the supply curve XS of (9), it follows that the marginal cost of producing X bitcoins\n\nat a given level of di\u00a2culty ! is\n\npf\nb !\n\npb\n\nX; !\n\n=\n\n%\n\n&\n\n/F + (#\n\n1000 (24) pe\n\nM !\n\n(! + f )\n\u2019\n\n(24)602#M !109\n\"232\n\n(\n\nh\n\ni\n\n(13)\n\nwhere pb (XS; !) is the inverse supply curve. Proposition 1 demonstrates that since the\n\nfundamental value is found at the intersection of the supply curve XS of (9) with the vertical\n\nline X = X; an increase in di\u00a2culty causes the fundamental value to appreciate at a rate\n\nthat is equal to the rate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty. Referring to Figure 1, an increase\n\nin di\u00a2culty from !1 to !2 results in an increase in the fundamental value of a bitcoin from\n\npb1 = pb\n\nX; !1\n\nto pb2 = pb\n\nX; !2\n\n; where\n\n: An increase in di\u00a2culty causes\n\npb(X;\"2)\npb(X;\"1)\n\n= \"2\n\"1\n\nthe market price of bitcoins to appreciate at a rate that is less than the rate of increase in\n\n%\n\n&\n\n%\n\n&\n\nthe level of di\u00a2culty, however, because the market price is found at the intersection of the\n\nsupply curve XS of (9) with the demand curve XD of (11), and hence an upward rotation of\n\nthe supply curve results in an increase in the market price that is less than the proportional\n\nincrease in di\u00a2culty.21 This divergence is even greater for higher elasticities of demand.\n\nReferring again to Figure 1, an increase in the level of di\u00a2culty from !1 to !2 results in an\n\nincrease in the market price from pb2 to pb3; which corresponds to a movement along the\n\ndemand curve from point 2a to point 3. Since pb(X2;\"2)\n\npb(X2;\"1) = \"2\n\n\"1\n\n; it is clear from Figure 1 that\n\npb3\npb2\n\n< \"2\n\"1\n\n:\n\nIn summary, we have established that the supply of bitcoins is linear and upward sloping\n\nthrough the origin. An increase (decrease) in the level of di\u00a2culty results in an upward\n\n(downward) rotation of the supply curve. After 2016 blocks have been mined, if the Bitcoin\n\nnetwork detects that the mining rate di\u00a7ers from the target of 144 blocks per day, the protocol\n\n21As we will see in Section 3, Figure 13 depicts the relation between the market price of bitcoins and the\n\nlevel of di\u00a2culty as predicted by Proposition 1(ii).\n\n21\n\n\fwill adjust the di\u00a2culty in such a way that the existing network hashrate will result in a\n\n10-minute interval between successive blocks mined. The protocol\u00eds enforcement of a \u00d6xed\n\nquantity of bitcoins supplied over time results in exaggerated price responses and successive\n\npositive demand shocks result in a rapidly increasing price path that may be mistaken for a\n\nbubble despite being based on marginal costs. Proposition 1 characterizes the fundamental\n\nvalue of a bitcoin and establishes that the return on bitcoins is proportional to the rate of\n\nincrease in the level of di\u00a2culty.\n\n2.1 E\u00a2ciency\n\nWe have seen that the Bitcoin protocol uses the level of di\u00a2culty as an instrument to\n\nmaintain a mining rate of 144 blocks per day. In this section we will see that an increase\n\nin di\u00a2culty works in e\u00a7ect like a government\u00eds placing an ad valorem tax on the price of a\n\ncommodity. Hence, whenever the protocol increases the di\u00a2culty, a distortion loss results\n\nbecause too few bitcoins are produced relative to the equilibrium quantity that would exist\n\nin the absence of an intervention. Instead of accruing tax revenue, however, the increase\n\nin di\u00a2culty imposes additional electricity costs on miners. Although a higher price for the\n\nbitcoin is obtained, the rents that would have arisen from limiting the supply are wasted as\n\nthey neither bene\u00d6t a government nor the miners. An analogous scenario obtains whenever\n\nthe protocol decreases the level of di\u00a2culty.\n\nRecall that an increase in the level of di\u00a2culty rotates the supply curve upward so that,\n\nfor a given quantity of bitcoins supplied, the supply price under the new level of di\u00a2culty\n\nis proportional to the supply price under the previous level of di\u00a2culty. When the protocol\n\nincreases the di\u00a2culty from !1 to !2; it follows from XS of (9) that\n\npb (XS; !2)\npb (XS; !1)\n\n=\n\n!2\n!1 !\n\n1 +  \n\n(14)\n\n22\n\n\fand hence an increase in di\u00a2culty is equivalent to a government\u00eds imposing an ad valorem\n\ntax on the price of bitcoins equal to the percentage increase in the level of di\u00a2culty   > 0:\n\nFigure 4a extends Figure 1 to assess, employing a partial equilibrium framework, the\n\ne\u00a7ect on social welfare of an increase in di\u00a2culty. As shown in Figure 4a, after the increase\n\nin di\u00a2culty, the price of a bitcoin rises to pb3 and the quantity of bitcoins produced per day\n\nfalls to X3. There is a wedge between the price consumers pay pb3 under the higher di\u00a2culty\n\nlevel and the price miners receive p0b3; where pb3 = (1 +  ) p0b3; since a total of  p0b3 for each of\n\nthe X3 bitcoins that are produced per day is dissipated as additional electricity costs. Since\n\nX2\n\nX3 bitcoins are no longer traded in the market, the consumer and producer surplus that\n\noccurs in market equilibrium 2 is reduced by the distortion or \u00ebdeadweight\u00ed loss depicted by\n\nthe dotted triangular area. The consumer and producer surplus that occurred in equilibrium\n\n2 is also reduced by the additional electricity costs depicted by the large hatched rectangular\n\n\"\n\narea.\n\nIt follows that both consumers and miners that participate in equilibrium 2 are adversely\n\na\u00a7ected by the increase in di\u00a2culty,22 and that an increase in di\u00a2culty is far less e\u00a2cient\n\nthan if a government were to impose an equivalent ad valorem tax on miners that would\n\nyield the same equilibrium price pb3 and quantity X3. While the tax would result in the\n\nsame distortion loss as the di\u00a2culty adjustment, it would provide government revenue while\n\nthe rents that go toward the additional electricity costs under the di\u00a2culty adjustment are\n\n22The relative proportion of losses depends on the relative elasticities of supply and demand.\n\n23\n\n\fsimply wasted.\n\nFigure 4a.

See the Appendix.\n\nIf instead there is a negative demand shock that leads to a mining rate that is less than\n\n144 blocks per day, the operation of the Bitcoin protocol is symmetric in the sense that the\n\nlevel of di\u00a2culty will decrease. Analogously to Proposition 2, we can express the welfare\n\ngain due to a percentage decrease in di\u00a2culty given by ' = \"2\n\n< 0 as approximately\n\n\"1\n\n\"\n\"1\n\n. (') =\n\n'pb (X3; !1) X3\n\n\"\n\n1\n2\n\n\"\n1 + \"\n\n\"\n\npb2X2'2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \" is the elasticity of demand, pb2 and X2 are the equilibrium price and quantity before\n\nthe decrease in di\u00a2culty from !1 to !2, and X3 is the equilibrium quantity after the decrease\n\nin di\u00a2culty. Figure 4b depicts an initial comprehensive equilibrium labeled 1, with price pb1;\n\nquantity X and level of di\u00a2culty !1; and a negative demand shock that leads to a decrease\n\nin the market price to pb2: Because some miners will exit the industry in response to the\n\nlower price of bitcoins, in the subsequent equilibrium labeled 2, the mining rate is less than\n\n144 blocks per day. Consequently, the protocol will decrease the level of di\u00a2culty from !1 to\n\n!2: The supply curve rotates downward until the mining rate is equal to the target X given\n\nthe network hashrate associated with pb2: Consequently, the price falls to pb3 and the mining\n\nrate increases to X3 in the equilibrium labeled 3. It follows from (14) that a decrease in\n\ndi\u00a2culty is equivalent to a government\u00eds providing an ad valorem subsidy to miners equal to\n\nthe percentage decrease in the level of di\u00a2culty (i.e., when ' < 0). There is a wedge between\n\nthe price consumers pay pb3 under the lower level of di\u00a2culty !2 and the price that miners\n\nreceive p0b3, where pb3 = (1 + ') p0b3; since a total of\n\n'p0b3 for each of the X3 bitcoins that\n\n\"\n\nare produced per day is gifted by the protocol as lower electricity costs. As shown in Figure\n\n4b, the reduction in costs results in a level of output X3 that is too large for consumers\n\nand producers to capture the full bene\u00d6t, since the hatched rectangular area is reduced by a\n\ndistortion loss depicted by the dotted triangular area. A decrease in di\u00a2culty, however, is far\n\n25\n\n\fmore e\u00a2cient than the equivalent ad valorem subsidy to the miners since it would result in\n\nthe same distortion loss but there is no cost to the government due to providing the subsidy.\n\nFigure 4b. A decrease in the level of di\u00a2culty.\n\nThe following proposition compares the loss due to an increase in the level of di\u00a2culty\n\nwith the gain that is due to an equivalent percentage decrease in the di\u00a2culty. It demon-\n\nstrates that the welfare cost of an increase in di\u00a2culty is larger than the welfare bene\u00d6t of\n\nan equivalent proportional decrease in the di\u00a2culty.\n\nProposition 3 The welfare loss due to a percentage   increase in di\u00a2culty is greater in\n\nabsolute value than the gain in welfare due to a percentage decrease in the di\u00a2culty by the\n\nsame percentage.\n\nProof. See the Appendix.\n\nFigure 4c depicts a decrease in di\u00a2culty and an increase in di\u00a2culty by the same pro-\n\nportion. Since an increase in the di\u00a2culty occurs whenever the equilibrium quantity prior to\n\n26\n\n\fthe change in di\u00a2culty is greater than the target supply of bitcoins X, whereas a decrease in\n\nthe di\u00a2culty occurs whenever the equilibrium quantity is lower than X; the wedge between\n\nthe price consumers pay under the new level of di\u00a2culty and the price that miners receive is\n\nlarger under the di\u00a2culty increase. While the proportional change is the same, it is, under\n\nthe increase in di\u00a2culty, applied to a higher price, and over a greater quantity. Hence, as\n\nshown in Figure 4c, because the supply curve is upward sloping, increases in di\u00a2culty are\n\nnot o\u00a7set by commensurate proportional decreases in di\u00a2culty since their welfare e\u00a7ects do\n\nnot have the same size. Moreover, the distortion losses that amass each time the level of\n\ndi\u00a2culty is changed reduce the welfare bene\u00d6ts and further increase the welfare costs.\n\nFigure 4c. An equivalent proportional increase and decrease in di\u00a2culty.\n\nIn this section we have established that while Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer\n\npayment network with no central authority, its protocol regularly intervenes in the market\n\nby using the level of di\u00a2culty as an instrument to maintain a constant supply of bitcoins over\n\ntime. Consequently, demand shocks give rise to volatile prices and the price path may exhibit\n\n27\n\n\fmomentum and boom-and-bust cycles. Proposition 1 establishes that the fundamental value\n\nof the bitcoin is characterized by miners\u00ed equipment and electricity costs relative to their\n\nexpected block reward and fees. Using it as a benchmark, it follows that the market price of\n\nbitcoins appreciates in proportion to the rate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty. While the\n\nmarket is allocatively e\u00a2cient, since price is equal to marginal cost (and hence the bitcoin\n\nis an e\u00a2cient store of value for the electricity costs used in its production), Proposition 2\n\nestablishes that losses are incurred by contemporaneous consumers and producers (miners)\n\nof bitcoins whenever the level of di\u00a2culty rises. Moreover, Proposition 3 demonstrates that\n\nthe welfare costs that arise because of increases in the level of di\u00a2culty are not o\u00a7set by\n\nequivalent proportional decreases in the level of di\u00a2culty, and hence the protocol imposes\n\nwelfare losses on society that accumulate over time. While the bitcoin is esteemed for its\n\nnongovernmental design, its system of supply management is far less e\u00a2cient than if a\n\ngovernment were to regulate the number of bitcoins by imposing a tax on its price.\n\n3 Data description\n\nIn this section I describe the data and perform model diagnostics to assess how well the\n\ntheoretical model set out in Section 2 \u00d6ts the data.\n\nThe data was acquired from several sources. The daily average USD price of the bitcoin\n\nacross major bitcoin exchanges, daily data on the Bitcoin di\u00a2culty level, the Bitcoin block\n\nreward and fee, and the number of blocks mined per day, were acquired by using Blocksci,\n\nan open-source software platform for blockchain analysis.23;24 Daily USD price data for new\n\n(unused) Antminer mining rigs (models S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S7, S9 and S11) sold on Amazon\n\nMarketplace by third party sellers, which is accessible from Amazon.com, was acquired by\n\n23See Kalodner et al. (2017) and https://github.com/citp/BlockSci.\n24Note that Blocksci utilizes an API for coindesk.com to provide the end of day price of a bitcoin.\n\n28\n\n\fusing an API for the Amazon price tracker Keepa.com.25 The reported price is the lowest\n\nof the prices available from the sellers and does not include shipping costs; missing data\n\ncorrespond to periods of time when all sellers are out of stock. The mining rig speci\u00d6ca-\n\ntions regarding the hash rate and energy e\u00a2ciency were obtained directly from Amazon.com\n\nand are provided in Table 1. Since several Antminer models may be sold in the Amazon\n\nMarketplace at a given point in time, I constructed the daily average USD price by aver-\n\naging over the prices of all Antminer models that were available for sale on a given day.\n\nSimilarly, to obtain the daily average hashrate and the daily average energy e\u00a2ciency of\n\nthe Antminer rigs, I averaged over the gigahashes per second (GHash/s) and the joules per\n\ngigahash (Joules/GHash) of all Antminer models that were available for sale on the given\n\nday, respectively.\n\nThe sample period is 17 March 2014 to 13 January 2019. Although the \u00d6rst Antminer rig\n\n(model S1) was available to the public from Amazon Marketplace on 30 December 2013, as\n\nshown in Table 1, 17 March 2014 was the \u00d6rst day that price information on the Antminer\n\nS1 rig was tracked by Keepa.com. While there are numerous brands of bitcoin mining rigs\n\navailable on the market (and it is possible for miners to build their own rig), Antminer rigs,\n\nwhich are produced by the Chinese company Bitmain, are on the technological frontier in\n\nterms of their power and energy e\u00a2ciency. Bitmain sells its hardware to the general public\n\nand its market share is estimated to be 70%\u00f180%.26\n\nMining typically takes place in countries where there is cheap electricity, such as the\n\nPeople\u00eds Republic of China, the Czech Republic, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Georgia,\n\nRussian Federation, Sweden, and the United States. However, by far the most mining takes\n\n25The Amazon standard identi\u00d6cation numbers (ASIN) that identify the models are: B00I0F4IMI,\nB00KH9339O, B00NZDBWKG, B00NWHT18A, B00RCTIY4G, B014OGCP6W, B01MCZVPFE, and\nB07KPF2DJJ.\n\n26See https://coincentral.com/how-antminer-became-the-best-bitcoin-mining-hardware-in-less-than-two-\n\nyears/.\n\n29\n\n\fplace in the People\u00eds Republic of China.27 Bitmain, which owns one of the world\u00eds largest\n\nbitcoin mines, in Inner Mongolia, was known to be paying just 4 cents per kWh of electricity\n\n(DeVries, 2018). Consequently, I conservatively estimate the average price of electricity used\n\nin mining to be 0.05 USD per kWh. Also, I estimate the expected lifespan of a mining rig\n\nto be two years, so that the daily depreciation rate is 1/730.\n\nFigure 5 depicts the bitcoin price path over the sample period in both levels and logs.\n\nWhile the price has an exponential growth, since the logarithm of the price is approximately\n\nlinear, numerous boom-and-bust cycles are also evident, with the largest boom occurring in\n\nlate 2017. On 16 December 2017, bitcoin reached its maximum price of 19,343.04 USD,28\n\nand the price has predominantly decreased since that time up to the end of the sample\n\nperiod. Figure 6 depicts the daily level of di\u00a2culty over the sample period in both levels\n\nand logs. It is clear that the level of di\u00a2culty has been increasing exponentially until 17\n\nOctober 2018, which is about 10 months beyond the point at which the price of a bitcoin\n\nbegan to fall. After 17 October 2018, the di\u00a2culty has predominantly decreased (4 of the\n\n6 remaining di\u00a2culty adjustments were decreases). Over the sample period, the level of\n\ndi\u00a2culty was adjusted downward only 21 times, which is 15.9% of all di\u00a2culty adjustments.\n\nFigure 7 depicts the sum of the Bitcoin block reward and fees over the sample period. It\n\nis clear that the block reward was halved from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins on 9 July 2016\n\nand that fees were much more prevalent throughout 2017, probably due to congestion in\n\nthe Bitcoin blockchain. Figure 8 presents a standard plot and a boxplot of the number of\n\nblocks mined per day (the daily mining rate), where a horizontal line is drawn at the target\n\nmining rate of 144 blocks. It is clear that the mining rate frequently di\u00a7ers from its target,\n\nreaching a minimum of 80 blocks per day (on 11 and 12 November 2017) and a maximum of\n\n27It is estimated that Chinese mining pools control more than 70% of the Bitcoin network\u00eds collective\n\nhashrate. See https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/.\n\n28Recall that the price data is an average over the major bitcoin exchanges. As stated in the Introduction,\n\nthe highest price reached by Bitcoin on a single exchange was 19,783.21 USD.\n\n30\n\n\f216 blocks per day (on 10 December 2015) during the sample period. The mean and median\n\nblocks mined per day are 151.6 and 151, respectively, indicating that the daily mining rate\n\ntypically exceeds the target during the sample period.\n\nFigure 9 depicts the Antminer rig speci\u00d6cations over the sample period. We can see\n\nthat, on average, Antminer rigs have become more powerful over time, since their hashrate\n\nis increasing. While the energy e\u00a2ciency of the rigs is improving, as the rate of joules per\n\ngigahash is decreasing over time, their greater power is large enough to result in greater\n\nenergy use since the number of watts used (joules per second) is increasing over time. Note\n\nthat the gaps in the Antminer rig speci\u00d6cation data from 12 October 2017 to 17 October\n\n2017, from 19 October 2017 to 26 October 2017, from 13 November 2017 to 17 November\n\n2017, from 24 November 2017 to 5 December 2017, from 9 December 2017 to 10 December\n\n2017, and from 3 January 2018 to 4 January 2018 correspond to periods of time when none of\n\nthe sellers in the Amazon Marketplace had any of the Antminer rigs listed in Table 1 in stock.\n\nThis demonstrates that there was probably excess demand for mining equipment during this\n\ntime period, which was when the price of the bitcoin was quite high (approximately 5,500\n\nUSD) and rising rapidly. Figure 10 depicts the average price of Antminer rigs over the\n\nsample period and their average price per gigahash per second. We can see that mining\n\nequipment costs have generally increased in tandem with the market price of the bitcoin\n\n(the correlation between the bitcoin\u00eds price and the average price of Antminer rigs is .59).\n\nThe average price of Antminer rigs relative to their average gigahash per second, however,\n\nhas been steadily decreasing over time and reached a low of 0.03 USD by the end of the\n\nsample period. Figure 11 depicts the miners\u00ed daily average equipment and electricity costs\n\nas de\u00d6ned in (8) and the proportion of electricity in their daily costs over time.29 With\n\nthe exception of late 2017, when mining equipment was extraordinarily costly due to the\n\n29Which, from (8), is\n\n\"$\n1000 (24)pe\n\n)F + \"$\n\n1000 (24)pe\n\n:\n\n31\n\n\fplausible excess demand, electricity costs were growing as a share of the miners\u00ed daily costs.\n\nElectricity costs approached 80.2% of daily costs by the end of the sample period due to the\n\nincreasing energy usage of the mining equipment evident in Figure 9 and the falling price of\n\nmining rigs evident in Figure 10.\n\n3.1 Model diagnostics\n\nFigure 12 assesses whether the Bitcoin network adjusts the di\u00a2culty according to Eq. (12).\n\nThe diagram plots the ratio of the new level of di\u00a2culty relative to the previous one against\n\nthe mining rate divided by the target mining rate of 144, where the mining rate is the average\n\nnumber of blocks mined per day during the interval between di\u00a2culty adjustments. It is\n\nclear that the data are consistent with (12) since the points line up on the 45 degree line\n\nand the two variables have a correlation of .99.\n\nTo check Proposition 1, which states that the bitcoin\u00eds market price pb appreciates at a\n\nrate of\n\n1\n1+\" times the rate of increase of the level of di\u00a2culty !, Figure 13 plots the log of\n\nthe bitcoin\u00eds market price against the log of the level of di\u00a2culty, where the price data have\n\nbeen aggregated by taking the mean over the interval between adjustments of the level of\n\ndi\u00a2culty. We can see that the relation between the price and di\u00a2culty is remarkably strong\n\nand, as predicted by the model, log-linear. Using least squares provides an estimate of the\n\nslope equal to 0.58, where the regression line is drawn in Figure 13 along with the 45 degree\n\nline. (The regression results are provided in Table 2.) In accordance with Proposition 1, the\n\nrate of increase in the market price is estimated to be less than the rate of increase in the\n\nlevel of di\u00a2culty. Also, it follows from Proposition 1 that we can then estimate the elasticity\n\nof demand \" to be equal to .72,30 which is close to the estimate of \" I obtain directly through\n\nidenti\u00d6cation of the demand curve in Section 5.2 below.31\n\n30We have that\n31We will see in Section 5.2 that I obtain an estimate of the price elasticity of demand equal to :73:\n\n1\n1+\" = :58 or, equivalently, \" = :72:\n\n32\n\n\fNext, I use the data to simulate the fundamental value of the bitcoin de\u00d6ned in (13)\n\nand compare it with the market price of the bitcoin. As we have seen in Section 2, the\n\nfundamental value is not necessarily equal to the market price. While the fundamental value\n\nis independent of the demand parameters 1 and \", one can argue that the level of di\u00a2culty\n\n! is a su\u00a2cient statistic for them, since, as described in Section 2, adjustments in di\u00a2culty\n\ndepend on the equilibrium mining rate detected by the network, which depends on both the\n\nsupply and demand for bitcoins. Figure 14 depicts the simulated fundamental value and the\n\nactual price of the bitcoin in both levels and logs. The fundamental value tracks variations\n\nin the market price quite well since the correlation between them is .79. We can see that\n\nthe fundamental value rose sharply in July 2016 when the block reward was halved, since a\n\ndecrease in the block reward decreases the miners\u00ed expected block reward. It also fell sharply\n\nin July 2017 because of the introduction of the powerful Antminer S9,32 since an increase in\n\nthe hashpower of the miners\u00ed equipment increases the miners\u00ed expected block reward. It is\n\nplausible that the market price of a bitcoin does not exhibit such sharp adjustments because\n\nboth of these events could have been anticipated by participants in the bitcoin market. From\n\nFigure 14 it is clear that the fundamental value follows the general shape of the bitcoin price\n\npath since it exhibits an exponential upward trend and a large boom and bust phase that\n\nstarted in late 2017, albeit with a lag. As such, Figure 14 presents evidence that adjustments\n\nin the level of di\u00a2culty by the protocol are in response to the level of market prices prior\n\nto the new level of di\u00a2culty, during the interim between di\u00a2culty adjustments, as they\n\nincentivize the network hashrate in accordance with the model set out in Section 2.33 Figure\n\n15 plots the di\u00a7erence between the actual bitcoin price and the simulated fundamental value,\n\nin both levels and logs. We can see that the market price was in line with the fundamental\n\n32We can see from Figure 9 that the Antminer S9 became the dominant Antminer rig in the market in\n\nJuly 2017 since the average hashpower of the Antminer rigs approaches 14,000 GHash/s.\n\n33From Figure 1 it is clear that after the di\u00a2culty adjustment to (2; the fundamental value is equal to\npb2, which is the price that incentivized the network hashrate during the interim between the di\u00a2culty\nadjustments (1 and (2:\n\n33\n\n\fvalue well up to late 2017, after which the actual price exceeded the fundamental value by\n\n100% to 185% until early 2018. After 17 August 2018, the price exceeded the fundamental\n\nvalue by less than 35% in absolute value and was again in line with the fundamental value.\n\nTo better understand the discrepancy between the market price and the fundamental\n\nvalue between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2017, it is informative to compare the network\n\nhashrate #M ! inferred from (7) as a function of the market price pb and the network hashrate\n\ndetermined by solving for the target waiting time to \u00d6nd a block of (5) for #M as a function\n\nof the level of di\u00a2culty !. The former network hashrate presumes the instantaneous free\n\nentry of miners in response to expected pro\u00d6ts driven by the market price of bitcoin. Given\n\nthe network\u00eds choice of di\u00a2culty, the latter network hashrate yields a ten-minute interval\n\nbetween successive blocks mined. If the free entry of miners is an accurate assumption, then\n\nboth approaches must yield the same network hashrate when the level of di\u00a2culty is adjusted\n\nsince whenever M = M !; from (5) it follows that ! = !!: As shown in Figure 16, however,\n\nthe network hashrate predicted by (7) was signi\u00d6cantly larger in late 2017 than the network\n\nhashrate that yields a ten-minute block time of (5), indicating that there were probably\n\nbarriers to entry during this time period. Despite the soaring price of the bitcoin, it is clear\n\nfrom Figure 8 that the average number of blocks mined per day (the mining rate) reached\n\nits lowest values in the sample period during late 2017 and it is clear from Figure 6 that the\n\nnetwork decreased the level of di\u00a2culty four times between 1 July 2017 and 31 December\n\n2017,34 which are consistent with insu\u00a2cient mining. It is plausible that entry was unable to\n\nkeep step with rapidly increasing prices due to a shortage of mining equipment, exacerbated\n\nby the obsolescence of the mining equipment that was already in operation. As noted above,\n\nduring this six-month period, there were occasions when none of the sellers in the Amazon\n\nMarketplace had an Antminer rig in their inventory, indicating that state-of-the-art rigs were\n\n34This represents 19% of the total number of decreases in di\u00a2culty that were granted by the network in\n\na six-month period, during the almost \u00d6ve-year sample period.\n\n34\n\n\fgenerally di\u00a2cult to acquire.35 Also, the introduction of the Antminer S9, whose hash power\n\nis nearly three times that of the S7 and more than seven times that of the S5, could have\n\nforced the exit of miners whose equipment was no longer pro\u00d6table. Moreover, signi\u00d6cant\n\ntime lags between higher bitcoin prices and the adoption of new equipment could have been\n\ncaused by requisite learning costs for miners. It follows that the anomalous 10 month period\n\nbetween December 2017 and October 2018, during which the di\u00a2culty was increasing while\n\nthe price of a bitcoin was decreasing, could have occurred because the rate of mining was\n\ncatching up to the rate that was consistent with the incentives provided by market prices,\n\ngiven the hashpower of the latest equipment.36\n\nIn summary, we have seen that the data is largely consistent with the model formulated\n\nin Section 2. While there was a large discrepancy between the market price of the bitcoin\n\nand its fundamental value in late 2017, this probably resulted from barriers to entry that are\n\nnot wholly captured by the model. It remains to test whether \u00e1uctuations in the price path\n\nthat are not explained by the model can be attributed to price bubbles caused by investor\n\nbehavior.\n\n4 Econometric model\n\n4.1 Testing for multiple bubbles\n\nIn this section I apply the bubble detection method developed in Phillips et al. (2015a; 2015b)\n\nto determine whether deviations of the market price of the bitcoin from its fundamental value\n\n35Massive demand for mining equipment is not unprecedented. For instance, the rise of bitcoin mining\nwas responsible for creating a global shortage of graphics cards, which were initially a pro\u00d6table way to mine\nfor bitcoins prior to the invention of application speci\u00d6c integrated circuits (ASICs).\n\n36For a discussion of this anomalous time period, see the article in The Economist, available at\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/02/07/will-bitcoins-price-crash-cut-into-its-energy-use.\n\n35\n\n\fas de\u00d6ned in Section 2 demonstrate evidence of explosive behavior.37 Phillips et al. (2015a;\n\n2015b) extend Phillips et al. (2011), which develops a supremum augmented Dickey\u00f1Fuller\n\n(SADF) test for the presence of a bubble based on a sequence of forward recursive right-tailed\n\nADF unit root tests, and a dating strategy that identi\u00d6es points of origin and termination\n\nof a bubble based on a backward regression technique. The generalized supremum ADF\n\n(GSADF) method developed in Phillips et al. (2015a; 2015b) also relies on recursive right-\n\ntailed ADF tests but uses \u00e1exible window widths in its implementation. Instead of \u00d6xing the\n\nstarting point of the recursion at the \u00d6rst observation, the GSADF test extends the sample\n\ncoverage by changing both the starting point and the endpoint of the recursion over a feasible\n\nrange of \u00e1exible windows. This enhanced approach is designed to outperform previous bubble\n\ndetection methods in detecting explosive behavior whenever multiple bubble episodes occur\n\nin the data, since it covers more subsamples of the data and has greater window \u00e1exibility.\n\nIt also delivers a consistent dating mechanism whenever multiple bubbles occur.\n\nSpeci\u00d6cally, for a times series yt that has size T; the ADF test for a unit root against the\n\nalternative of an explosive root (right-tailed) is undertaken by using least squares to estimate\n\nthe following autoregressive speci\u00d6cation\n\n/yt = 1r1;r2 + 8r1;r2yt\n\"\n\n1 +\n\n i\n\nr1;r2/yt\n\"\n\ni + 9t; 9t\n\nN ID\n\n0; =2\n\nr1;r2\n\n#\n\n(17)\n\n%\n\n&\n\nk\n\ni=1\nX\n\nfor a given lag order k, where N ID denotes independent and normally distributed.

(2011) is a special case of the backward supremum\n\nADF test with r1 = 0.) The estimated origination date of a bubble is de\u00d6ned as the\n\n\u00d6rst observation whose backward supremum ADF statistic exceeds its corresponding critical\n\nvalue, which is based on r2T observations. The estimated termination date of a bubble is the\n\nsubsequent observation (that exceeds a speci\u00d6ed period of time) whose backward supremum\n\nADF statistic falls below its corresponding critical value. The date-stamping strategy may\n\nbe used as an ex ante real-time dating procedure, whereas the GSADF test is an ex post\n\nstatistic used for analyzing a given data set for bubble behavior.\n\nAs shown in the Appendix,38 from XS of (9) and XD of (11) it follows that the relation\n\n38See the proof of Proposition 1.\n\n37\n\n\fbetween the market price of a bitcoin pb and its fundamental value pf\n\nb is log-linear:\n\nlog (pb) =\n\nlog (1)\n\nlog\n\nX\n\n+\n\n1\n1 + \"\n\n1\n1 + \"\n\n\"\n\n1\n1 + \"\n\nlog\n\npf\nb\n\n:\n\n*\n\n+\n\n%\n\n&\n\nTreating demand shocks 1 as random, I use ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the\n\nrelation between the price of a bitcoin and its fundamental value\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nlog pbt = 10 + 11 log pf\n\nbt + 9t\n\nfor daily observations indexed by t.\n\nThe estimates obtained for 10 and 11 are reliable because serial correlation in the errors\n\nwill not a\u00a7ect the unbiasedness or consistency of OLS estimators.39 Any departures of the\n\nprice of bitcoin from the marginal cost of mining must be evident in the residuals from the\n\nregression\n\n9t = log pbt\n\n10\n\n11 log pf\n\nbt: For this reason, I apply the SADF and GSADF tests\n\nto the residuals to determine if there is any empirical evidence of explosive behavior to infer\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\nb\n\nc\n\nc\n\nthe existence of bubbles.40 While this approach is consistent with the model of Section 2, as a\n\nrobustness check, I also test whether there is evidence of explosive behavior in the di\u00a7erence\n\nlog pbt\n\nlog pf\n\n\"\n\nbt; which does not rely on performing least squares. Measuring the price of the\n\nbitcoin relative to its fundamental value amounts to holding the supply curve constant for a\n\ngiven level of di\u00a2culty, which isolates changes in the price of a bitcoin that are due to shifts\n\nin the demand curve during the interim between adjustments of the di\u00a2culty, and removes\n\nthe e\u00a7ects of the di\u00a2culty adjustment mechanism on the price.\n\n39Serial correlation in the errors will a\u00a7ect the e\u00a2ciency of the estimates, however, and with positive serial\ncorrelation, the OLS estimates of the standard errors will be smaller than the true standard errors. See\nPindyck and Rubinfeld (1997).\n\n40I undertake both tests for the sake of completeness and to provide the reader with as much evidence as\n\npossible.\n\n38\n\n\f4.2 Estimating e\u00a2ciency losses\n\nIn order to estimate the e\u00a2ciency losses net of gains established in (15) and (16), I \u00d6rst es-\n\ntimate the elasticity of demand \" for bitcoins. The model set out in Section 2 indicates that\n\nshort intervals of time surrounding adjustments in the Bitcoin di\u00a2culty level will be charac-\n\nterized by large supply shocks that are likely to swamp any shocks to demand, permitting\n\nidenti\u00d6cation of the demand curve.\n\ndemand equations are given by\n\nAfter log linearizing XS of (9) and XD of (11), it follows that the structural supply and\n\nXD = \"pb + 9d\n\n(20)\n\nXS = D1pb + D2z + 9s\n\nwhere \" is the parameter of interest and the exogenous supply shifters included in z (the\n\nlevel of di\u00a2culty, block reward and fees, mining hashrate, energy e\u00a2ciency, and equipment\n\ncosts), enter only the supply equation and not the demand equation. The asymptotic bias\n\nin the least squares estimate of \" depends on the correlation of pb with the demand shocks\n\n9d since\n\nplim\n\n\"OLS = \" +\n\ncov (9d; pb)\nvar (pb)\n\n:\n\nIt follows that if least squares is used to estimate \" during a period in which supply shocks\n\nb\n\nare large relative to demand shocks, there will be large supply-induced changes in pb with\n\nonly small changes in 9d: Least squares will not be very biased since the numerator of the\n\nbias term will be small while the denominator will be large.\n\nTo distinguish periods of time in which di\u00a2culty adjustments have large e\u00a7ects on the\n\nsupply, I choose intervals of sizes 7, 9, 11 and 13 days centered at the time of the di\u00a2culty\n\nadjustment. This procedure uses about 50% to 93% of the data, since there are approximately\n\n14 days between di\u00a2culty adjustments. The size of the interval trades o\u00a7 the need to have\n\n39\n\n\fenough data to estimate the demand curve accurately with the need to hone in on a period\n\nof time in which there is relatively more variation in supply than demand. After \u00d6xing the\n\nlength of the time interval, I use least squares to estimate Eq. (20) for each interval that\n\noccurs during the sample period, and keep only those estimates of \" that are signi\u00d6cant at\n\na 5% (or better) level. For each length of time interval (7, 9, 11 and 13 days), I obtain an\n\nestimate of \" by averaging over the retained estimates for that time interval, yielding an\n\nestimate that has a lower variance than any estimate obtained from an interval around a\n\nsingle di\u00a2culty adjustment. Since this procedure provides an estimate of \" for each interval\n\nlength, the robustness of the method is indicated by the stability of the estimate over the\n\nfour window sizes. Finally, I derive a single estimate for \" by averaging over these estimates,\n\nproviding a further reduction in variance.\n\nNext, I estimate - of (15) and . of (16) for each interval between di\u00a2culty adjustments,\n\nto \u00d6nd the total e\u00a2ciency losses over the sample period.41 For each interval between di\u00a2culty\n\nadjustments, I \u00d6nd the average number of blocks mined per day (the daily mining rate) to\n\ndetermine the average quantity of bitcoins supplied per day X2 and then, holding the initial\n\nlevel of di\u00a2culty !1 constant, use the inverse supply curve derived from (9) to estimate the\n\ncorresponding price pb2. I use the approximation for X3 provided in Proposition 2 to \u00d6nd\n\nthe average quantity of bitcoins supplied after the di\u00a2culty adjustment and then obtain\n\nthe corresponding price pb (X3; !1) from the inverse supply curve derived from (9). The\n\npercentage change in the level of di\u00a2culty   is obtained by subtracting 1 from the ratio of\n\nthe level of di\u00a2culty at the end of the interval !2 to the level of di\u00a2culty at the beginning\n\nof the interval !1 according to Eq. (14). I use the estimate of the elasticity of demand \"\n\nobtained from the procedure described above. Finally, if the percentage change in the level of\n\ndi\u00a2culty is positive, I calculate the average loss according to - of (15) and if it is negative,\n\n41Note that in order to include all intervals, gaps in the Antminer rig speci\u00d6cation and price data during\n\nlate 2017 were \u00d6lled by replacing each missing value with the most recent present value prior to it.\n\n40\n\n\fI calculate the average bene\u00d6t according to . of (16). I estimate the total net e\u00a2ciency\n\nloss due to adjustments in the Bitcoin di\u00a2culty level by multiplying each average loss or\n\nbene\u00d6t by the length of the interval (the number of days between the respective di\u00a2culty\n\nadjustments) and then aggregate the total losses net of the total bene\u00d6ts throughout the\n\nsample period.\n\n5 Results\n\n5.1 Testing for bubbles\n\nI \u00d6rst estimate Eq. (19) to obtain the regression residuals. The regression results are reported\n\nin Table 3 and Figure 17 depicts the scatter plot of the log price of bitcoin versus the log of\n\nits fundamental value, and plots the regression line in addition to the 45 degree line. It is\n\nclear from Figure 17 that there is a strong, positive log-linear relation between the market\n\nprice of the bitcoin and its fundamental value. Also, the slope of the regression line is less\n\nthan 1, which, as shown in (18), is in accordance with the model.\n\nI apply the summary SADF and GSADF tests to the log bitcoin price data, the OLS\n\nresiduals from the regression of the log bitcoin price on the log fundamental value, and\n\ndi\u00a7erence between the log bitcoin price and the log fundamental value. Table 4 presents\n\nthe test statistics and the \u00d6nite sample critical values of the two tests obtained from Monte\n\nCarlo simulations with 2,000 replications of 1764 observations.\n\nIn performing the ADF\n\nregressions and calculating the critical values, the smallest window contains 93 observations\n\nof the sample, based on the rule r0 = :01 + 1:8=p1764:\n\nIn regard to the log price data series, from Table 4, the SADF and GSADF statistics are\n\n3.7 and 3.9, which both exceed their 1% right-tailed critical values (3:7 > 2:2 and 3:9 > 2:9),\n\nproviding strong evidence of explosive subperiods in the raw bitcoin price data. Figure 18\n\n41\n\n\fdepicts the backward ADF sequence (based on the SADF test) and the corresponding 95%\n\nand 99% ADF critical values obtained from Monte Carlo simulations with 2,000 replications\n\nfor each observation of interest, for the log price data series (and, for the sake of completeness,\n\neach time series in question). Figure 19 depicts the analogous information for the backward\n\nSADF sequence (based on the GSADF test). From Figure 18 it is clear that there is one\n\nidenti\u00d6ed period of explosive behavior for the log price time series, when the recursive ADF\n\nstatistic exceeds the 95% critical value sequence, that is at least one week long. This is\n\n2017-05-01 to 2018-11-15. The recursive ADF statistic continues to exceed the 99% critical\n\nvalue sequence for two subsets of this time period. These are 2017-05-20 to 2018-03-30; and\n\n2018-04-08 to 2018-05-25. From Figure 19, there are seven identi\u00d6ed periods of explosive\n\nbehavior for the log price time series, when the recursive SADF statistic exceeds the 95%\n\ncritical value sequence, that are at least one week long. These are 2014-09-28 to 2014-10-08;\n\n2015-01-13 to 2015-01-20; 2015-11-02 to 2015-11-09; 2016-05-28 to 2016-06-21; 2016-12-22 to\n\n2017-01-05; 2017-03-01 to 2018-05-22; and 2018-11-19 to 2018-12-16. The recursive SADF\n\nstatistic continues to exceed the 99% critical value sequence for four subsets of these time\n\nperiods. These are 2016-06-03 to 2016-06-20; 2016-12-23 to 2017-01-04; 2017-05-19 to 2018-\n\n03-06; and 2018-11-20 to 2018-12-08. It is clear from comparing Figures 18 and 19 that the\n\nstrategy based on the recursive SADF test statistic is more sensitive since, at the 5% level of\n\nsigni\u00d6cance, it identi\u00d6es periods of explosive behavior that are not detected by the strategy\n\nbased on the recursive ADF test statistic.\n\nOnce we take into account the fundamental value of the bitcoin, however, it is clear\n\nfrom Table 4 that the SADF and GSADF statistics for the OLS residuals and the di\u00a7erence\n\nbetween the log price and the log fundamental value are well below their 10% right-tailed\n\ncritical values. There is no overwhelming evidence of bubbles in the price of the bitcoin since\n\nwe cannot reject the null hypothesis of no bubbles at even the 10% signi\u00d6cance level. It fol-\n\nlows that once we take into account the Bitcoin protocol\u00eds di\u00a2culty adjustment mechanism,\n\n42\n\n\fthe explosive behavior that is apparent in the bitcoin price path is explained.\n\n5.2 Estimating e\u00a2ciency losses\n\nFor each length of the intervals (7, 9, 11 and 13 days), centered at the time of the di\u00a2culty\n\nadjustment, the estimates of the elasticity of demand \" are 0:112; 1:16; 0:847; and 0:818,\n\nrespectively. The average estimate, then, is :73, which demonstrates that there is a fairly\n\ninelastic demand for the bitcoin. Using this estimate for the elasticity of demand, I estimate\n\nthe total net e\u00a2ciency losses from 17 March 2014 to 13 January 2019 to be 323.82 million\n\nUSD.42 Table 5 shows the breakdown of the net losses for each year in the sample period\n\nand Figure 20 presents a plot of the net e\u00a2ciency losses for each year along with the unique\n\nlevels of di\u00a2culty over time.43 While the total net losses imply an average annual net loss\n\nof approximately 66.39 million USD, as shown in Figure 20, the average is misleading as\n\na measure of the annual costs since the net e\u00a2ciency losses were increasing exponentially\n\nthroughout the majority of the sample period. Since, from - of (15), the losses are an\n\nincreasing function of the change in the level of di\u00a2culty !, this is due to the fact that the\n\nlevel of di\u00a2culty was increasing exponentially during that time. To put these losses into\n\nperspective, I estimate the total electricity used by the Bitcoin network in terawatt hours\n\n(TWh), which is provided in the third column of Table 5.44 Assuming an electricity cost\n\nof 0.05 USD per kWh, the net e\u00a2ciency losses due to adjustments in the level of di\u00a2culty\n\nas a percentage of the total cost of electricity used to power the Bitcoin network are shown\n\nin the fourth column of Table 5. Since the electricity used by the Bitcoin network also\n\n42I estimate the total e\u00a2ciency losses to be 390.73 million USD and the total e\u00a2ciency bene\u00d6ts to be 66.91\nmillion USD. The large magnitude of losses relative to gains is in accordance with Proposition 3 and because\nonly 15.9% of the di\u00a2culty adjustments during the sample period were downward.\n\n43Note that the \u00d6rst year is only approximately 10 months long due to the length of the sample period.\n44Since the network hashrate is %M ! gigahashes per second, the terawatt hours used by the network can\nbe estimated as %M !* 24\n1012 per day, where M ! is given in (7). While using M ! to estimate the hashrate\npresumes the free entry of miners, it is consistent with the estimate of e\u00a2ciency losses , of (15) and bene\u00d6ts\n- of (16), which also presume free entry.\n\n43\n\n\fhas been increasing exponentially due to the fact that the level of di\u00a2culty was increasing\n\nexponentially over the majority of the sample period, the e\u00a2ciency losses as a percentage of\n\ntotal electricity costs have been fairly stable and are, on average, 9.3% of the total electricity\n\ncosts.\n\nIn this section we have seen that while both the SADF and GSADF tests provide ev-\n\nidence of explosiveness in the bitcoin price path, applying the same tests after specifying\n\nfundamentals in accordance with the model does not. While there was a signi\u00d6cant di\u00a7er-\n\nence between the fundamental value of the bitcoin and its price during late 2017 (as shown in\n\nFigure 15), the discrepancy does not provide evidence for explosive behavior and hence, even\n\nduring this time period, there is no evidence of bubble formation. As discussed in Section\n\n3.1, this discrepancy is probably due to entry barriers not taken into account by the model.\n\nIt follows that the model is su\u00a2cient to explain any explosive behavior in bitcoin prices.\n\nThis result provides strong evidence that the boom and bust cycles apparent in the bitcoin\n\nprice data are not bubbles caused by investor behavior but rather are a consequence of the\n\neconomic functioning of the Bitcoin protocol. We have also seen that in order to maintain\n\na constant supply of bitcoins in the market, the protocol imposes e\u00a2ciency losses (bene\u00d6ts)\n\non contemporaneous consumers and miners of bitcoin whenever the level of di\u00a2culty rises\n\n(falls). On average, net costs were about 9.3% of the total electricity costs to run the Bitcoin\n\nnetwork during the sample period.\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nThis paper has developed a microeconomic model to analyze the economic functioning of\n\nthe Bitcoin protocol. The model established that the fundamental value of a bitcoin is\n\nequal to the miners\u00ed equipment and electricity costs relative to their expected block reward\n\nand fees. While Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer network with no central authority,\n\n44\n\n\fthe mechanism for adjusting the level of di\u00a2culty encoded in its protocol amounts to an\n\nin\u00e1exible system of supply management. Hence, demand shocks have an exaggerated e\u00a7ect\n\non the price of the bitcoin and each adjustment in the level of di\u00a2culty of mining a bitcoin\n\nresults in social welfare losses. We have seen that once we specify the fundamentals, which\n\ninclude the miners\u00ed costs and their expected block reward and fees, there is no evidence of\n\nthe formation of bubbles in the price of the bitcoin. Also, we have seen that the social welfare\n\nlosses imposed by the protocol\u00eds intervention in the market add up to over 320 million USD\n\nfrom March 2014 to January 2019. While these costs were incurred by the contemporaneous\n\nconsumers and miners, it is the eventual holders of bitcoins who bene\u00d6t over time since\n\nthe price of the bitcoin appreciates by an amount proportional to the rate of increase in\n\nthe Bitcoin di\u00a2culty level. To the extent that bitcoin mining is not powered by renewable\n\nresources, we should further take into consideration the external costs of bitcoin production,\n\nsince electricity generation is one of the leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions. I leave\n\na thorough analysis of this important issue for future research.\n\n45\n\n\fReferences\n\nbastopol, CA: O\u00edReilly.\n\nWorking paper.\n\n[1] Antonopoulos, A.

I view the bitcoin as a tradable commodity that is produced by \nminers  and  whose  supply  is  managed  by  the  protocol.  The  findings  show  that  bitcoin\u2019s \nvolatile  price  path  and  inefficiency  are  related,  and  that  both  are  a  consequence  of  the \nprotocol\u2019s system of supply management. I characterize the fundamental value of a bitcoin \nand demonstrate that the return on bitcoin appreciates proportionally to the rate of increase \nin  the  level  of  difficulty.  In  the  model,  where  the  price  of  a  bitcoin  is  based  on  marginal \nproduction costs, successive positive demand shocks result in a rapidly increasing price path \nthat  may  be  mistaken  for  a  bubble.  The  generalized  supremum  augmented  Dickey-Fuller \n(GSADF)  test  is  used  to  demonstrate  that  the  model  is  able  to  account  for  the  explosive \nbehavior  in  the  bitcoin  price  path,  providing  strong  evidence  that  bitcoin  is  not  a  bubble.  I \nalso show that the difficulty adjustment mechanism results in social welfare losses from 17 \nMarch 2014 to 13 January 2019 of $323.8 million, which is about 9.3% of the miners\u2019 total \nelectricity costs during this time period. \n \nKeywords: bitcoin, digital coins, Bitcoin protocol, cryptocurrency, bitcoin bubble \n \nJEL Classification: F30, G00, G11 \n \n \n", " \n \n"]}
