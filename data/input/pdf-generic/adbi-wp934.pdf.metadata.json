I view the bitcoin as a tradable commodity that is produced by \nminers and whose supply is managed by the protocol. The findings show that bitcoin\u2019s \nvolatile price path and inefficiency are related, and that both are a consequence of the \nprotocol\u2019s system of supply management. I characterize the fundamental value of a bitcoin \nand demonstrate that the return on bitcoin appreciates proportionally to the rate of increase \nin the level of difficulty. In the model, where the price of a bitcoin is based on marginal \nproduction costs, successive positive demand shocks result in a rapidly increasing price path \nthat may be mistaken for a bubble. The generalized supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller \n(GSADF) test is used to demonstrate that the model is able to account for the explosive \nbehavior in the bitcoin price path, providing strong evidence that bitcoin is not a bubble.

And while it is a\ndigital currency, it cannot assume a value as do \u00d6at currencies, because no government has\ndeclared it to be legal tender. Bitcoin is most analogous to a commodity such as co\u00a7ee,\nwhich is produced by \u00ebsmall\u00ed farmers who are uncoordinated in their production decisions.\nWhile miners use electricity to produce bitcoins (instead of sunshine), the analogy is not\nfar-fetched, as evidenced by the fact that miners demonstrate a strong preference for joining\nmining pools,2 which are similar in structure to co\u00a7ee cooperatives since they are designed\nto share the risk among their members.3 Also, co\u00a7ee farmers once bene\u00d6ted from the now\ndefunct International Co\u00a7ee Agreement (ICA), which was a system of quotas that resulted\nin high and stable prices by organizing the supply of farmers worldwide.4 Encoded in the\nBitcoin protocol is a similar system of supply management that the Bitcoin network sustains\nbyitsnear-perfectmonitoringoftherateofblockformation(andthusthequantityofbitcoins\nsupplied) and enforces by regular adjustments in the level of di\u00a2culty of mining a bitcoin.\nBitcoin, however, has the additional feature of being a medium of exchange and a tradable\n1I follow the convention of capitalizing the word \u00ebbitcoin\u00ed when referring to the protocol or network and\nwriting it in lowercase when referring to the unit of currency.\n2According to hashrate distribution statistics provided by BTC.com, more than 95% of the Bitcoin\nnetwork hashrate for 2018 can be attributed to mining pools. See https://btc.com/stats/pool\n3Mining pools enable miners to decrease the variance of their returns by sharing their processing power\nover a network and splitting the reward according to the amount of work that each has contributed to the\nprobability of \u00d6nding a block.\n4The ICA was a quota system that was in operation between 1962 and 1989. The system was suspended\nbecause of failure to agree on the quota distribution and the increasing volume of co\u00a7ee traded with non-\nmember importing countries at lower prices. See Talbot (2004).\n2", "asset with numerous well-developed market exchanges, resulting in a unique class of asset\nwith characteristics that have never before been seen. I show that bitcoin\u00eds volatile price\npath and ine\u00a2ciency are related, as they both result from the protocol\u00eds system of supply\nmanagement.\nBitcoin, the \u00d6rst cryptocurrency, was invented by an unknown individual who imple-\nmented the software as open-source code. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are electronic\npayment systems that permit transactions to be made with pseudo-anonymity5 and without\nmiddlemen like banks. Bitcoin was launched on January 3, 2009. Until July 2010, the price\nof a bitcoin was less than 0.01 USD. By the beginning of 2017, the price had risen astound-\ningly to a stable 1,000 USD and it reached a peak value of 19,783 USD in December 2017.\nThe price has been generally falling since that time, with the exception of a few resurgences.\nBitcoin\u00eds price path is notoriously volatile and has evinced a multitude of boom-and-bust\ncycles over its 10-year lifespan. While there are numerous historical examples of bubbles,\nstarting as far back as the Dutch tulipmania (1634\u00f17),6 one is hard-pressed to identify an\nasset price or an episode of market exuberance that exempli\u00d6es the ceaseless de\u00e1ations and\nre-in\u00e1ations that are apparent in the price path of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.7\nIt is challenging to identify bubbles in market data because one needs to know an asset\u00eds\nfundamental value in order to identify a divergence between it and the asset\u00eds price. More-\nover, econometric tests of asset price bubbles do not do a good job of di\u00a7erentiating between\nmisspeci\u00d6ed fundamentals and bubbles (Gurkaynak, 2005).\nMiningistheprocessbywhichbitcoinsarecreated. Bitcoinminersuseelectricitytosolve\ncomplex mathematical puzzles in order to verify the transactions added to the blockchain.\n5Bitcoin addresses are not tied to the identity of their users but since all transactions over the Bitcoin\nnetwork are completely transparent and traceable, multiple Bitcoin addresses can be clustered together and\nthen associated with a particular user. See Meiklejohn et al. (2013).\n6See Garber (1989; 1990) and Brunnermeier (2008) for a discussion of the history of price bubbles.\n7Itistheoreticallypossible,however,forrationalbubblestoperiodicallycollapsetoasmallnonzerovalue\nand then to continue to increase. See Evans (1991).\n3", "Solving this \u00ebproof of work\u00ed (PoW) problem requires tremendous computational power and\nthe \u00d6rst miner to succeed (\u00d6nd a correct hash) is rewarded with new bitcoins.8 The Bitcoin\nprotocol speci\u00d6es a target that a correct hash must fall below, which implies a level of\ndi\u00a2culty for the computational problem. A lower target corresponds to a greater level of\ndi\u00a2culty because it is less likely that a hash will fall within the correct range. Changes\nin the target and hence the level of di\u00a2culty a\u00a7ect the rate of block formation because an\nincrease (decrease) in di\u00a2culty decreases (increases) the probability that a miner will \u00d6nd\na correct hash. Since the production of a block increases the supply of bitcoins according\nto the block reward,9 changes in the level of di\u00a2culty also determine the growth rate of the\nsupply of bitcoins over time.\nAlthough the Bitcoin network is managed by peer-to-peer technology without a central\nauthority, it uses the level of di\u00a2culty as an instrument to enforce an in\u00e1exible system of\nsupply management. The protocol regulates the quantity of bitcoins that are mined by\nadjusting the level of di\u00a2culty every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks). There\nis an interval of time between adjustments in the level of di\u00a2culty, so that the network can\naccurately estimate the waiting time to \u00d6nd a block. If the network detects that the time\nrequired to \u00d6nd the last 2016 blocks di\u00a7ers from 20,160 minutes, then the network uses the\nestimated mining rate to adjust the level of di\u00a2culty proportionally in order to target a\nten-minute interval between successive blocks mined. Only when the mining rate is equal to\nits target will the level of di\u00a2culty be unchanged.\nTo ascertain the value of a bitcoin, in Section 2 of the paper, I model the competitive\nbitcoin mining industry with free entry of miners in response to pro\u00d6ts that are created in\naccordance with the Bitcoin protocol. For simplicity, there is no secondary market for the\nbitcoin and all input markets are held constant. I de\u00d6ne the fundamental value of the bitcoin\n8The current block reward is 12.5 bitcoins.\n9The block reward decreases by one-half only every 210,000 blocks, or approximately four years. See\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply.\n4", "to be the marginal cost of producing a bitcoin when the mining rate is equal to its target.\nThis is a natural de\u00d6nition since the value of a bitcoin is governed by the protocol\u00eds system\nof supply management, and it is the unique price that is consistent with its rules. The\nmodel reveals that the fundamental value of a bitcoin is equal to the miners\u00ed equipment and\nelectricity costs, relative to their expected revenue (block reward and fees, multiplied by the\nexpected number of blocks mined). Also, the fundamental value of the bitcoin appreciates\nby an amount that is equal to the rate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty and, assuming a\nconstant-elasticity demand curve for bitcoin, the return on bitcoin is proportional to the rate\nof increase in the level of di\u00a2culty. I establish how adjustments of the level of di\u00a2culty in\nresponse to demand shocks result in exaggerated price movements that may be mistaken for\na bubble. The supply of bitcoins is upward sloping since a higher price of a bitcoin results\nin a greater number of entrants (miners), which increases the network hashrate and thus\nthe number of blocks mined per day. If a positive demand shock results in a mining rate\nthat exceeds its target, then the Bitcoin protocol will stipulate an increase in the level of\ndi\u00a2culty. I show that an increase in di\u00a2culty decreases the supply of bitcoins (it rotates\nthe supply curve upward) since it results in greater marginal electricity costs for the miners.\nThis causes an exaggerated upward price movement since the initial price increase caused\nby the demand shock is ampli\u00d6ed by the decrease in supply. Since the protocol aims at\nmaintaining a constant supply of bitcoins per day, prices are largely demand driven and thus\nvariations in demand are transformed by the process of adjusting the level of di\u00a2culty into\nprice volatility.\nInterestingly, if the increase in demand is due to the optimistic beliefs of investors regard-\ning the future price of bitcoins, the subsequent increase in di\u00a2culty will work to validate\ninvestor\u00eds beliefs, encouraging another round of optimism. While I do not model beliefs\nin this paper, it is intuitively clear how the protocol can interplay with investor\u00eds beliefs,\nresulting in the momentum of price movements over time: a greater demand for bitcoins\n5", "causes higher bitcoin prices, which causes more miners to enter the industry, which results\nin a mining rate that exceeds its target, which leads to intervention by the protocol and a\nhigher level of di\u00a2culty, which causes greater than laissez-faire prices, which leads to greater\ndemandforbitcoinsbyinvestors... andsoon, untilanexogenouseventbreaksthecycle. The\nresulting sequence of positive demand shocks ampli\u00d6ed by increases in the level of di\u00a2culty\ncan result in an explosive price path that may be mistaken for a bubble despite being based\non marginal costs. The analysis of a negative demand shock is analogous: a series of negative\ndemand shocks may be mistaken for a bursting bubble since the equilibrium price will fall\nrapidly as the di\u00a2culty decreases. It follows that the economic functioning of the Bitcoin\nprotocol can result in boom-and-bust cycles in the price of the bitcoin. Unlike a bubble,\nhowever, the price is equal to marginal cost all the while.\nNext, I show that because the protocol intervenes in the market to control the supply of\nbitcoins, welfare losses must occur as a result. An increase in di\u00a2culty works analogously\nto a government\u00eds placing an ad valorem tax on the price of the bitcoin since the supply\nprice increases in proportion to the di\u00a2culty adjustment. Instead of accruing tax revenue,\nhowever, the increase in di\u00a2culty imposes additional electricity costs on the miners. While\na higher price for the bitcoin is obtained, the rents that would have arisen from limiting the\nsupply are wasted as they neither bene\u00d6t a government nor the miners. A decrease in the\nlevel of di\u00a2culty works analogously to a government that provides an ad valorem subsidy (a\nnegative tax) to the miners, but I show that the welfare e\u00a7ects of an increase in di\u00a2culty\nare not o\u00a7set by a decrease in di\u00a2culty by the same proportion since the absolute change\nin electricity costs is greater under the increase, and a distortion loss must be experienced\nunder either. Ironically, while the bitcoin is esteemed for its nongovernmental design, it\nfollows that its system of supply management is far less e\u00a2cient than if a government were\nto regulate the quantity of bitcoins by imposing a tax on its price.\nBitcoin is a particularly advantageous choice of asset for studying price behavior since\n6", "the protocol\u00eds rules are clearly stated and thus the functioning of the overall system is fully\ntransparent. Also, the entire population of data pertaining to the supply of bitcoins and\nhow the Bitcoin protocol is implemented over time are readily available from its blockchain\nledger.10 I parse the Bitcoin blockchain to obtain time series data for the network level\nof di\u00a2culty, the number of blocks mined per day, the block reward and fees, and describe\nthe data in Section 3 along with data pertaining to bitcoin mining equipment speci\u00d6cations\nand costs, and the average USD market price of the bitcoin across major bitcoin exchanges.\nI examine model diagnostics and show that the data is largely consistent with the model\ndeveloped in Section 2.\nSince prices are typically well approximated by a random walk in the absence of bubbles\nbut are characterized by an explosive path during periods of bubbles, recent econometric\ntechniques identify rational speculative bubbles by testing for a mildly explosive departure\nfrom a random walk.11;12 Such tests were originally proposed by Phillips et al. (2011) and\nfurther developed by Phillips and Yu (2011), Homm and Breitung (2012), and Phillips et al.\n(2015a; 2015b). In Section 4, I outline the generalized version of the supremum augmented\nDickey\u00f1Fuller (GSADF) test based on Phillips et al. (2015a; 2015b), which delivers a con-\nsistent date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles, and\napply it to determine whether the boom-and-bust cycles evident in bitcoin price data can\nbe explained by the fundamentals derived in Section 2. I also apply the model developed in\nSection 2 to estimate the welfare losses that are due to adjustments in the level of di\u00a2culty\nthroughout the sample period. Since estimating welfare losses requires an estimate of the\nprice elasticity of demand for bitcoins, I exploit the timing of adjustments in the di\u00a2culty to\nisolate periods that are characterized by large supply shocks in order to identify the demand\n10The blockchain ledger also records all transactions between users with the exception of \u00ebo\u00a7-chain\u00ed trans-\nactions such as those occurring on bitcoin exchanges.\n11These tests can detect rational bubbles as well as other bubble-generating mechanisms, such as intrinsic\nbubbles, herd behavior and time-varying discount factor fundamentals.\n12For a survey of the literature on bubbles see Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2012).\n7", "curve.\nIpresenttheresultsinSection5. I\u00d6ndthatwhiletherawbitcoinpricedatademonstrates\nevidence of bubble formation, the residuals after \u00d6tting the price to the fundamental value as\nde\u00d6ned by the model do not. This provides strong evidence that the model can explain the\napparent bubbles since, after accounting for the protocol\u00eds di\u00a2culty adjustment mechanism,\nthe price path reverts to a random walk. I obtain an estimate for the total welfare losses\nfrom 17 March 2014 to 13 January 2019 of 323.82 million USD, which is about 9.3% of the\ntotal electricity costs to power the Bitcoin network during this time.\nSection 6 presents the conclusions.\nThere is a small but rapidly growing economics literature on the topic of Bitcoin and\ncryptocurrencies. The comprehensive empirical analysis conducted in Liu and Tsyvinski\n(2018) using price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple demonstrates that the mean and\nstandard deviation of returns for cryptocurrencies are an order of magnitude higher than\nthose for traditional asset classes. Also, with the exception of the exposure of Ethereum to\ngold, cryptocurrencies have no exposure to most common stock market and macroeconomic\nfactors, and their returns can be best predicted by two factors speci\u00d6c to their markets: mo-\nmentum and investor attention. Bianchi (2018) uses a large panel of prices, traded volumes,\nand market capitalization on 14 actively quoted cryptocurrencies to empirically investigate\ntheir relation with standard asset classes. The main empirical results suggest that, except\nfor a mild correlation with gold and crude oil, there is no signi\u00d6cant relation between returns\non cryptocurrencies and more traditional asset classes. Dong et al. (2018) \u00d6nd that bitcoin\nprice dynamics are signi\u00d6cantly sensitive to investor sentiment. The authors use sentiment\ndata to show that stricter regulations for Bitcoin predict a decrease in future returns and an\nincrease in the probability of a future price collapse, and that market sentiment positively\ncomoves with bitcoin prices.\nThese empirical studies characterize features of Bitcoin returns that are consistent with\n8", "themainpremiseofthispaper: thebitcoinisatradablecommoditywhosesupplyismanaged\nbytheBitcoinprotocol, whichcreatesanassetthatisradicallydi\u00a7erentfromthosebelonging\ntotraditionalassetclasses. Asdiscussedabove,sincetheprotocolusesadi\u00a2cultyadjustment\nmechanism to target a constant supply of bitcoins per day, prices are in excess of their\nlaissez-faire counterparts and are demand driven. As such, it is intuitive that bitcoin returns\nare supernormal and volatile, and that prices are highly sensitive to investor attention and\nsentiment. Also, since the di\u00a2culty adjustment mechanism works to validate investor\u00eds\nbeliefs regarding future price movements, it is natural that the bitcoin price path would\ndemonstrate momentum. While Dong et al. (2018) attribute the price responses to bubbles,\nin this paper I show that it is the fundamental value of Bitcoin that manifests volatile and\npotentially explosive behavior due to the e\u00a7ect of di\u00a2culty adjustments on the miners\u00ed costs.\nThe papers most closely related to the present paper are Pagnotta and Buraschi (2018)\nand Easley et al. (2017). Pagnotta and Buraschi (2018) study the general equilibrium of a\ndecentralized \u00d6nancial network and derive closed-form solutions linking the bitcoin price to\nmarket fundamentals. The authors develop a theoretical model where the Bitcoin network\u00eds\nvalue is driven by the number of users and miners who provide computing resources that\na\u00a7ect the network\u00eds trustworthiness. They \u00d6nd that, counterintuitively, the price of the\nbitcoin decreases whenever the marginal cost of mining increases since it will induce miners\nto provide a lower hashrate, which reduces network trust and ultimately the equilibrium\nprice. Easley et al. (2017) develop a game theoretic model to explain the strategic behavior\nof miners and users, and demonstrate that equilibrium in the bitcoin blockchain is a complex\nbalancing of user and miner participation. The authors \u00d6nd that transaction fees play a\ncrucial role in in\u00e1uencing the stability of the blockchain and that higher transaction fees are\ndriven by the queuing problems facing users, rather than by reductions in block rewards.\nIn contrast with Pagnotta and Buraschi (2018), the present paper considers a relatively\nunstructured demand side of the bitcoin market, focusing instead on the supply-side e\u00a7ect\n9", "of the protocol. I treat network quality and security, in addition to speci\u00d6c use cases that\nare mostly unobservable, as exogenous factors that may drive the demand for bitcoins. The\nmodel in this paper predicts a positive relation between the rate of increase in the price of a\nbitcoinandtherateofincreaseinthelevelofdi\u00a2culty,akeydeterminantofthemarginalcost\nof mining, and I showthat this prediction is strongly supported by the data. While Easley et\nal. (2017) study how the Bitcoin protocol a\u00a7ects the interaction between miners and users,\nand thus the determination of fees, the present paper treats fees as exogenous and studies\nhow the protocol a\u00a7ects the interaction between the miners and the purchasers of bitcoins\n(who may either hold it or use it to make transactions), and thus the determination of the\nprice of the bitcoin in the market. By leveraging an understanding of the microeconomics of\nbitcoin production, the model sheds light on the sources of \u00e1uctuations in the price of the\nbitcoin.\n2 The model\nA miner must collect new transactions into a block and then hash the block header to form a\n256-bitblockhashvalue.

It adjusts the di\u00a2culty in such a way that the current network hashrate\nresults in a ten-minute block interval.14 If the network detects that the time required to \u00d6nd\nthe last 2016 blocks di\u00a7ers from 20,160 minutes, which is a daily mining rate that di\u00a7ers\nfrom 144 blocks per day, then the level of di\u00a2culty will be adjusted as follows:\n! 20;160 minutes daily mining rate\n2\n= = (1)\n!

Since the price p\nb2\nis unchanged, it follows from (7) that an increase in di\u00a2culty does not result in an exit of\nminers from the industry.20 At the point labeled 2b, the protocol is in equilibrium since\nthe mining rate is equal to its target given the network hashrate #M ; and the network has\n2\nno further incentive to change the level of di\u00a2culty. Since the protocol has no knowledge\nof the demand curve, however, 2b is not, in general, a market equilibrium. At 2b there is\nexcess demand, which causes the price of a bitcoin to rise to p and the number of miners to\nb3\nincrease to M : At the market equilibrium labeled 3 with price p , the demand X is equal\n3 b3 D0\nto the supply of bitcoins given the new level of di\u00a2culty ! : While the protocol is no longer\n2\nin equilibrium, the mining rate is closer to its target than before the increase in di\u00a2culty.\nMorepertinently, however, sincep exceedsp ;itisclearfromFigure1thatthedecrease\nb3 b2\nin supply due to the greater di\u00a2culty results in an exaggerated price response relative to the\nprice that would have prevailed had the di\u00a2culty not been adjusted.

While the increase in demand may be due to the optimistic beliefs of\ninvestors regarding the future price of bitcoins, the protocol will work to increase the level\nof di\u00a2culty correspondingly, validating investors\u00ed beliefs, and encouraging another round of\noptimism! The analysis of a negative demand shock is analogous and a series of negative\ndemand shocks may be mistaken for a bursting bubble since the equilibrium price will fall\nrapidly as the level of di\u00a2culty decreases. It follows that the interaction of the Bitcoin\nprotocol with investors\u00ed beliefs can manifest as momentum and boom-and-bust cycles in the\n18", "price of bitcoins. Unlike a bubble, however, price is equal to marginal cost all the while.\nFigure 2. Successive positive demand shocks.\nIde\u00d6nethefundamentalvaluepf tobethatpricesuchthattheprotocolisinequilibrium.\nb\nWhile the fundamental value is not necessarily equal to the market price of a bitcoin, it\nprovides an appropriate theoretical benchmark since it is the protocol that governs its value.\nFurthermore, as shown in Figure 3, if a demand shock is permanent, the market price will\napproach the fundamental value since successive adjustments of the di\u00a2culty will occur\nuntil the mining rate is equal to its target in the limiting comprehensive equilibrium. Given\nthat the market is competitive, the protocol is constantly maneuvering the market price\ntoward pf; a process that is only temporarily disrupted by shocks to demand. Since the\nb\nfundamental value depends on the level of di\u00a2culty, it follows that the di\u00a7erence between\nthe market price and the fundamental value at a given point in time can be represented by a\nshift in demand that originated from a comprehensive equilibrium, along a constant supply\n19", "curve. For instance, referring to Figure 1, the di\u00a7erence between the market price p and\nb2\nthe fundamental value p while ! = ! , is due to the demand shock while holding the supply\nb1 1\ncurve X (! ) constant.\nS 1\nFigure 3.

Since pb(X2;\"2) = \"2; it is clear from Figure 1 that\npb(X2;\"1) \"1\npb3 < \"2:\npb2 \"1\nIn summary, we have established that the supply of bitcoins is linear and upward sloping\nthrough the origin. An increase (decrease) in the level of di\u00a2culty results in an upward\n(downward) rotation of the supply curve. After 2016 blocks have been mined, if the Bitcoin\nnetworkdetectsthattheminingratedi\u00a7ersfromthetargetof144blocksperday,theprotocol\n21As we will see in Section 3, Figure 13 depicts the relation between the market price of bitcoins and the\nlevel of di\u00a2culty as predicted by Proposition 1(ii).\n21", "will adjust the di\u00a2culty in such a way that the existing network hashrate will result in a\n10-minute interval between successive blocks mined. The protocol\u00eds enforcement of a \u00d6xed\nquantity of bitcoins supplied over time results in exaggerated price responses and successive\npositive demand shocks result in a rapidly increasing price path that may be mistaken for a\nbubble despite being based on marginal costs. Proposition 1 characterizes the fundamental\nvalue of a bitcoin and establishes that the return on bitcoins is proportional to the rate of\nincrease in the level of di\u00a2culty.\n2.1 E\u00a2ciency\nWe have seen that the Bitcoin protocol uses the level of di\u00a2culty as an instrument to\nmaintain a mining rate of 144 blocks per day. In this section we will see that an increase\nin di\u00a2culty works in e\u00a7ect like a government\u00eds placing an ad valorem tax on the price of a\ncommodity. Hence, whenever the protocol increases the di\u00a2culty, a distortion loss results\nbecause too few bitcoins are produced relative to the equilibrium quantity that would exist\nin the absence of an intervention. Instead of accruing tax revenue, however, the increase\nin di\u00a2culty imposes additional electricity costs on miners. Although a higher price for the\nbitcoin is obtained, the rents that would have arisen from limiting the supply are wasted as\nthey neither bene\u00d6t a government nor the miners. An analogous scenario obtains whenever\nthe protocol decreases the level of di\u00a2culty.\nRecall that an increase in the level of di\u00a2culty rotates the supply curve upward so that,\nfor a given quantity of bitcoins supplied, the supply price under the new level of di\u00a2culty\nis proportional to the supply price under the previous level of di\u00a2culty. When the protocol\nincreases the di\u00a2culty from ! to ! ; it follows from X of (9) that\n1 2 S\np (X ;! ) !\nb S 2 2\n= 1+  (14)\np (X ;! ) ! !\nb S 1 1\n22", "and hence an increase in di\u00a2culty is equivalent to a government\u00eds imposing an ad valorem\ntax on the price of bitcoins equal to the percentage increase in the level of di\u00a2culty   > 0:\nFigure 4a extends Figure 1 to assess, employing a partial equilibrium framework, the\ne\u00a7ect on social welfare of an increase in di\u00a2culty. As shown in Figure 4a, after the increase\nin di\u00a2culty, the price of a bitcoin rises to p and the quantity of bitcoins produced per day\nb3\nfalls to X . There is a wedge between the price consumers pay p under the higher di\u00a2culty\n3 b3\nlevel and the price miners receive p ; where p = (1+ )p ; since a total of  p for each of\n0b3 b3 0b3 0b3\nthe X bitcoins that are produced per day is dissipated as additional electricity costs.

The consumer and producer surplus that occurred in equilibrium\n2 is also reduced by the additional electricity costs depicted by the large hatched rectangular\narea.\nIt follows that both consumers and miners that participate in equilibrium 2 are adversely\na\u00a7ected by the increase in di\u00a2culty,22 and that an increase in di\u00a2culty is far less e\u00a2cient\nthan if a government were to impose an equivalent ad valorem tax on miners that would\nyield the same equilibrium price p and quantity X . While the tax would result in the\nb3 3\nsame distortion loss as the di\u00a2culty adjustment, it would provide government revenue while\nthe rents that go toward the additional electricity costs under the di\u00a2culty adjustment are\n22The relative proportion of losses depends on the relative elasticities of supply and demand.\n23", "simply wasted.\nFigure 4a.

See the Appendix.\nIf instead there is a negative demand shock that leads to a mining rate that is less than\n144 blocks per day, the operation of the Bitcoin protocol is symmetric in the sense that the\nlevel of di\u00a2culty will decrease. Analogously to Proposition 2, we can express the welfare\ngain due to a percentage decrease in di\u00a2culty given by ' = \"2 \"1 < 0 as approximately\n\"\"1\n1 \"\n.(') = 'p (X ;! )X p X '2 (16)\nb 3 1 3 b2 2\n\" \" 21+\"\nwhere \" is the elasticity of demand, p and X are the equilibrium price and quantity before\nb2 2\nthe decrease in di\u00a2culty from ! to ! , and X is the equilibrium quantity after the decrease\n1 2 3\nin di\u00a2culty. Figure 4b depicts an initial comprehensive equilibrium labeled 1, with price p ;\nb1\nquantity X and level of di\u00a2culty ! ; and a negative demand shock that leads to a decrease\n1\nin the market price to p : Because some miners will exit the industry in response to the\nb2\nlower price of bitcoins, in the subsequent equilibrium labeled 2, the mining rate is less than\n144 blocks per day. Consequently, the protocol will decrease the level of di\u00a2culty from ! to\n1\n! : The supply curve rotates downward until the mining rate is equal to the target X given\n2\nthe network hashrate associated with p : Consequently, the price falls to p and the mining\nb2 b3\nrate increases to X in the equilibrium labeled 3. It follows from (14) that a decrease in\n3\ndi\u00a2culty is equivalent to a government\u00eds providing an ad valorem subsidy to miners equal to\nthe percentage decrease in the level of di\u00a2culty (i.e., when ' < 0). There is a wedge between\nthe price consumers pay p under the lower level of di\u00a2culty ! and the price that miners\nb3 2\nreceive p , where p = (1+')p ; since a total of 'p for each of the X bitcoins that\n0b3 b3 0b3 \" 0b3 3\nare produced per day is gifted by the protocol as lower electricity costs. As shown in Figure\n4b, the reduction in costs results in a level of output X that is too large for consumers\n3\nand producers to capture the full bene\u00d6t, since the hatched rectangular area is reduced by a\ndistortion loss depicted by the dotted triangular area. Adecrease in di\u00a2culty, however, is far\n25", "more e\u00a2cient than the equivalent ad valorem subsidy to the miners since it would result in\nthe same distortion loss but there is no cost to the government due to providing the subsidy.\nFigure 4b. A decrease in the level of di\u00a2culty.\nThe following proposition compares the loss due to an increase in the level of di\u00a2culty\nwith the gain that is due to an equivalent percentage decrease in the di\u00a2culty. It demon-\nstrates that the welfare cost of an increase in di\u00a2culty is larger than the welfare bene\u00d6t of\nan equivalent proportional decrease in the di\u00a2culty.\nProposition 3 The welfare loss due to a percentage   increase in di\u00a2culty is greater in\nabsolute value than the gain in welfare due to a percentage decrease in the di\u00a2culty by the\nsame percentage.\nProof. See the Appendix.\nFigure 4c depicts a decrease in di\u00a2culty and an increase in di\u00a2culty by the same pro-\nportion. Since an increase in the di\u00a2culty occurs whenever the equilibrium quantity prior to\n26", "the change in di\u00a2culty is greater than the target supply of bitcoins X, whereas a decrease in\nthe di\u00a2culty occurs whenever the equilibrium quantity is lower than X; the wedge between\nthe price consumers pay under the new level of di\u00a2culty and the price that miners receive is\nlarger under the di\u00a2culty increase. While the proportional change is the same, it is, under\nthe increase in di\u00a2culty, applied to a higher price, and over a greater quantity. Hence, as\nshown in Figure 4c, because the supply curve is upward sloping, increases in di\u00a2culty are\nnot o\u00a7set by commensurate proportional decreases in di\u00a2culty since their welfare e\u00a7ects do\nnot have the same size. Moreover, the distortion losses that amass each time the level of\ndi\u00a2culty is changed reduce the welfare bene\u00d6ts and further increase the welfare costs.\nFigure 4c. An equivalent proportional increase and decrease in di\u00a2culty.\nIn this section we have established that while Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer\npayment network with no central authority, its protocol regularly intervenes in the market\nbyusingthelevelofdi\u00a2cultyasaninstrumenttomaintainaconstantsupplyofbitcoinsover\ntime. Consequently, demandshocksgiverisetovolatilepricesandthepricepathmayexhibit\n27", "momentum and boom-and-bust cycles. Proposition 1 establishes that the fundamental value\nof the bitcoin is characterized by miners\u00ed equipment and electricity costs relative to their\nexpected block reward and fees. Using it as a benchmark, it follows that the market price of\nbitcoins appreciates in proportion to the rate of increase in the level of di\u00a2culty. While the\nmarket is allocatively e\u00a2cient, since price is equal to marginal cost (and hence the bitcoin\nis an e\u00a2cient store of value for the electricity costs used in its production), Proposition 2\nestablishes that losses are incurred by contemporaneous consumers and producers (miners)\nof bitcoins whenever the level of di\u00a2culty rises. Moreover, Proposition 3 demonstrates that\nthe welfare costs that arise because of increases in the level of di\u00a2culty are not o\u00a7set by\nequivalent proportional decreases in the level of di\u00a2culty, and hence the protocol imposes\nwelfare losses on society that accumulate over time. While the bitcoin is esteemed for its\nnongovernmental design, its system of supply management is far less e\u00a2cient than if a\ngovernment were to regulate the number of bitcoins by imposing a tax on its price.\n3 Data description\nIn this section I describe the data and perform model diagnostics to assess how well the\ntheoretical model set out in Section 2 \u00d6ts the data.\nThe data was acquired from several sources.

Since several Antminer models may be sold in the Amazon\nMarketplace at a given point in time, I constructed the daily average USD price by aver-\naging over the prices of all Antminer models that were available for sale on a given day.\nSimilarly, to obtain the daily average hashrate and the daily average energy e\u00a2ciency of\nthe Antminer rigs, I averaged over the gigahashes per second (GHash/s) and the joules per\ngigahash (Joules/GHash) of all Antminer models that were available for sale on the given\nday, respectively.\nThe sample period is 17 March 2014 to 13 January 2019. Although the \u00d6rst Antminer rig\n(model S1) was available to the public from Amazon Marketplace on 30 December 2013, as\nshown in Table 1, 17 March 2014 was the \u00d6rst day that price information on the Antminer\nS1 rig was tracked by Keepa.com. While there are numerous brands of bitcoin mining rigs\navailable on the market (and it is possible for miners to build their own rig), Antminer rigs,\nwhich are produced by the Chinese company Bitmain, are on the technological frontier in\nterms of their power and energy e\u00a2ciency. Bitmain sells its hardware to the general public\nand its market share is estimated to be 70%\u00f180%.26\nMining typically takes place in countries where there is cheap electricity, such as the\nPeople\u00eds Republic of China, the Czech Republic, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Georgia,\nRussian Federation, Sweden, and the United States.

Consequently, I conservatively estimate the average price of electricity used\nin mining to be 0.05 USD per kWh. Also, I estimate the expected lifespan of a mining rig\nto be two years, so that the daily depreciation rate is 1/730.\nFigure 5 depicts the bitcoin price path over the sample period in both levels and logs.\nWhile the price has an exponential growth, since the logarithm of the price is approximately\nlinear, numerous boom-and-bust cycles are also evident, with the largest boom occurring in\nlate 2017. On 16 December 2017, bitcoin reached its maximum price of 19,343.04 USD,28\nand the price has predominantly decreased since that time up to the end of the sample\nperiod. Figure 6 depicts the daily level of di\u00a2culty over the sample period in both levels\nand logs. It is clear that the level of di\u00a2culty has been increasing exponentially until 17\nOctober 2018, which is about 10 months beyond the point at which the price of a bitcoin\nbegan to fall. After 17 October 2018, the di\u00a2culty has predominantly decreased (4 of the\n6 remaining di\u00a2culty adjustments were decreases). Over the sample period, the level of\ndi\u00a2culty was adjusted downward only 21 times, which is 15.9% of all di\u00a2culty adjustments.\nFigure 7 depicts the sum of the Bitcoin block reward and fees over the sample period. It\nis clear that the block reward was halved from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins on 9 July 2016\nand that fees were much more prevalent throughout 2017, probably due to congestion in\nthe Bitcoin blockchain. Figure 8 presents a standard plot and a boxplot of the number of\nblocks mined per day (the daily mining rate), where a horizontal line is drawn at the target\nmining rate of 144 blocks. It is clear that the mining rate frequently di\u00a7ers from its target,\nreaching a minimum of 80 blocks per day (on 11 and 12 November 2017) and a maximum of\n27It is estimated that Chinese mining pools control more than 70% of the Bitcoin network\u00eds collective\nhashrate.

The mean and median\nblocks mined per day are 151.6 and 151, respectively, indicating that the daily mining rate\ntypically exceeds the target during the sample period.\nFigure 9 depicts the Antminer rig speci\u00d6cations over the sample period. We can see\nthat, on average, Antminer rigs have become more powerful over time, since their hashrate\nis increasing. While the energy e\u00a2ciency of the rigs is improving, as the rate of joules per\ngigahash is decreasing over time, their greater power is large enough to result in greater\nenergy use since the number of watts used (joules per second) is increasing over time. Note\nthat the gaps in the Antminer rig speci\u00d6cation data from 12 October 2017 to 17 October\n2017, from 19 October 2017 to 26 October 2017, from 13 November 2017 to 17 November\n2017, from 24 November 2017 to 5 December 2017, from 9 December 2017 to 10 December\n2017, andfrom3January2018to4January2018correspondtoperiodsoftimewhennoneof\nthesellersintheAmazonMarketplacehadanyoftheAntminerrigslistedinTable1instock.\nThis demonstrates that there was probably excess demand for mining equipment during this\ntime period, which was when the price of the bitcoin was quite high (approximately 5,500\nUSD) and rising rapidly. Figure 10 depicts the average price of Antminer rigs over the\nsample period and their average price per gigahash per second. We can see that mining\nequipment costs have generally increased in tandem with the market price of the bitcoin\n(the correlation between the bitcoin\u00eds price and the average price of Antminer rigs is .59).\nThe average price of Antminer rigs relative to their average gigahash per second, however,\nhas been steadily decreasing over time and reached a low of 0.03 USD by the end of the\nsample period. Figure 11 depicts the miners\u00ed daily average equipment and electricity costs\nas de\u00d6ned in (8) and the proportion of electricity in their daily costs over time.29 With\nthe exception of late 2017, when mining equipment was extraordinarily costly due to the\n29Which, from (8), is 1\"00$0(24)pe :\n)F+1\"00$0(24)pe\n31", "plausible excess demand, electricity costs were growing as a share of the miners\u00ed daily costs.\nElectricity costs approached 80.2% of daily costs by the end of the sample period due to the\nincreasing energy usage of the mining equipment evident in Figure 9 and the falling price of\nmining rigs evident in Figure 10.\n3.1 Model diagnostics\nFigure 12 assesses whether the Bitcoin network adjusts the di\u00a2culty according to Eq. (12).\nThe diagram plots the ratio of the new level of di\u00a2culty relative to the previous one against\ntheminingratedividedbythetargetminingrateof144, wheretheminingrateistheaverage\nnumber of blocks mined per day during the interval between di\u00a2culty adjustments. It is\nclear that the data are consistent with (12) since the points line up on the 45 degree line\nand the two variables have a correlation of .99.\nTo check Proposition 1, which states that the bitcoin\u00eds market price p appreciates at a\nb\nrate of 1 times the rate of increase of the level of di\u00a2culty !, Figure 13 plots the log of\n1+\"\nthe bitcoin\u00eds market price against the log of the level of di\u00a2culty, where the price data have\nbeen aggregated by taking the mean over the interval between adjustments of the level of\ndi\u00a2culty. We can see that the relation between the price and di\u00a2culty is remarkably strong\nand, as predicted by the model, log-linear. Using least squares provides an estimate of the\nslope equal to 0.58, where the regression line is drawn in Figure 13 along with the 45 degree\nline. (The regression results are provided in Table 2.) In accordance with Proposition 1, the\nrate of increase in the market price is estimated to be less than the rate of increase in the\nlevel of di\u00a2culty. Also, it follows from Proposition 1 that we can then estimate the elasticity\nof demand \" to be equal to .72,30 which is close to the estimate of \" I obtain directly through\nidenti\u00d6cation of the demand curve in Section 5.2 below.31\n30We have that 1 =:58 or, equivalently, \"=:72:\n1+\"\n31We will see in Section 5.2 that I obtain an estimate of the price elasticity of demand equal to :73:\n32", "Next, I use the data to simulate the fundamental value of the bitcoin de\u00d6ned in (13)\nand compare it with the market price of the bitcoin. As we have seen in Section 2, the\nfundamental value is not necessarily equal to the market price. While the fundamental value\nis independent of the demand parameters 1 and \", one can argue that the level of di\u00a2culty\n! is a su\u00a2cient statistic for them, since, as described in Section 2, adjustments in di\u00a2culty\ndepend on the equilibrium mining rate detected by the network, which depends on both the\nsupply and demand for bitcoins. Figure 14 depicts the simulated fundamental value and the\nactual price of the bitcoin in both levels and logs. The fundamental value tracks variations\nin the market price quite well since the correlation between them is .79. We can see that\nthe fundamental value rose sharply in July 2016 when the block reward was halved, since a\ndecrease in the block reward decreases the miners\u00ed expected block reward. It also fell sharply\nin July 2017 because of the introduction of the powerful Antminer S9,32 since an increase in\nthe hashpower of the miners\u00ed equipment increases the miners\u00ed expected block reward. It is\nplausible that the market price of a bitcoin does not exhibit such sharp adjustments because\nboth of these events could have been anticipated by participants in the bitcoin market. From\nFigure 14 it is clear that the fundamental value follows the general shape of the bitcoin price\npath since it exhibits an exponential upward trend and a large boom and bust phase that\nstarted in late 2017, albeit with a lag. As such, Figure 14 presents evidence that adjustments\nin the level of di\u00a2culty by the protocol are in response to the level of market prices prior\nto the new level of di\u00a2culty, during the interim between di\u00a2culty adjustments, as they\nincentivize the network hashrate in accordance with the model set out in Section 2.33 Figure\n15 plots the di\u00a7erence betweenthe actual bitcoin price and the simulated fundamental value,\nin both levels and logs. We can see that the market price was in line with the fundamental\n32We can see from Figure 9 that the Antminer S9 became the dominant Antminer rig in the market in\nJuly 2017 since the average hashpower of the Antminer rigs approaches 14,000 GHash/s.\n33From Figure 1 it is clear that after the di\u00a2culty adjustment to ( ; the fundamental value is equal to\n2\np , which is the price that incentivized the network hashrate during the interim between the di\u00a2culty\nb2\nadjustments ( and ( :\n1 2\n33", "value well up to late 2017, after which the actual price exceeded the fundamental value by\n100% to 185% until early 2018. After 17 August 2018, the price exceeded the fundamental\nvalue by less than 35% in absolute value and was again in line with the fundamental value.\nTo better understand the discrepancy between the market price and the fundamental\nvalue between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2017, it is informative to compare the network\nhashrate#M inferredfrom(7)asafunctionofthemarketpricep andthenetworkhashrate\n! b\ndetermined by solving for the target waiting time to \u00d6nd a block of (5) for #M as a function\nof the level of di\u00a2culty !. The former network hashrate presumes the instantaneous free\nentry of miners in response to expected pro\u00d6ts driven by the market price of bitcoin. Given\nthe network\u00eds choice of di\u00a2culty, the latter network hashrate yields a ten-minute interval\nbetween successive blocks mined. If the free entry of miners is an accurate assumption, then\nbothapproachesmustyieldthesamenetworkhashratewhenthelevelofdi\u00a2cultyisadjusted\nsince whenever M = M ; from (5) it follows that ! = ! : As shown in Figure 16, however,\n! !\nthe network hashrate predicted by (7) was signi\u00d6cantly larger in late 2017 than the network\nhashrate that yields a ten-minute block time of (5), indicating that there were probably\nbarriers to entry during this time period. Despite the soaring price of the bitcoin, it is clear\nfrom Figure 8 that the average number of blocks mined per day (the mining rate) reached\nits lowest values in the sample period during late 2017 and it is clear from Figure 6 that the\nnetwork decreased the level of di\u00a2culty four times between 1 July 2017 and 31 December\n2017,34 which are consistent with insu\u00a2cient mining. It is plausible that entry was unable to\nkeep step with rapidly increasing prices due to a shortage of mining equipment, exacerbated\nby the obsolescence of the mining equipment that was already in operation. As noted above,\nduring this six-month period, there were occasions when none of the sellers in the Amazon\nMarketplacehadanAntminerrigintheirinventory, indicatingthatstate-of-the-artrigswere\n34This represents 19% of the total number of decreases in di\u00a2culty that were granted by the network in\na six-month period, during the almost \u00d6ve-year sample period.\n34", "generally di\u00a2cult to acquire.35 Also, the introduction of the Antminer S9, whose hash power\nis nearly three times that of the S7 and more than seven times that of the S5, could have\nforced the exit of miners whose equipment was no longer pro\u00d6table. Moreover, signi\u00d6cant\ntime lags between higher bitcoin prices and the adoption of new equipment could have been\ncaused by requisite learning costs for miners. It follows that the anomalous 10 month period\nbetween December 2017 and October 2018, during which the di\u00a2culty was increasing while\nthe price of a bitcoin was decreasing, could have occurred because the rate of mining was\ncatching up to the rate that was consistent with the incentives provided by market prices,\ngiven the hashpower of the latest equipment.36\nIn summary, we have seen that the data is largely consistent with the model formulated\nin Section 2. While there was a large discrepancy between the market price of the bitcoin\nand its fundamental value in late 2017, this probably resulted from barriers to entry that are\nnot wholly captured by the model. It remains to test whether \u00e1uctuations in the price path\nthat are not explained by the model can be attributed to price bubbles caused by investor\nbehavior.\n4 Econometric model\n4.1 Testing for multiple bubbles\nInthissectionIapplythebubbledetectionmethoddevelopedinPhillipsetal.

The model set out in Section 2 indicates that\nshort intervals of time surrounding adjustments in the Bitcoin di\u00a2culty level will be charac-\nterized by large supply shocks that are likely to swamp any shocks to demand, permitting\nidenti\u00d6cation of the demand curve.\nAfter log linearizing X of (9) and X of (11), it follows that the structural supply and\nS D\ndemand equations are given by\nX = \"p +9 (20)\nD b d\nX = D p +D z +9\nS 1 b 2 s\nwhere \" is the parameter of interest and the exogenous supply shifters included in z (the\nlevel of di\u00a2culty, block reward and fees, mining hashrate, energy e\u00a2ciency, and equipment\ncosts), enter only the supply equation and not the demand equation. The asymptotic bias\nin the least squares estimate of \" depends on the correlation of p with the demand shocks\nb\n9 since\nd\ncov(9 ;p )\nd b\nplim \" = \"+ :\nOLS\nvar(p )\nb\nIt follows that if least squares is usedbto estimate \" during a period in which supply shocks\nare large relative to demand shocks, there will be large supply-induced changes in p with\nb\nonly small changes in 9 : Least squares will not be very biased since the numerator of the\nd\nbias term will be small while the denominator will be large.\nTo distinguish periods of time in which di\u00a2culty adjustments have large e\u00a7ects on the\nsupply, I choose intervals of sizes 7, 9, 11 and 13 days centered at the time of the di\u00a2culty\nadjustment. Thisprocedureusesabout50%to93%ofthedata,sincethereareapproximately\n14 days between di\u00a2culty adjustments. The size of the interval trades o\u00a7 the need to have\n39", "enough data to estimate the demand curve accurately with the need to hone in on a period\nof time in which there is relatively more variation in supply than demand.

For each length of time interval (7, 9, 11 and 13 days), I obtain an\nestimate of \" by averaging over the retained estimates for that time interval, yielding an\nestimate that has a lower variance than any estimate obtained from an interval around a\nsingle di\u00a2culty adjustment. Since this procedure provides an estimate of \" for each interval\nlength, the robustness of the method is indicated by the stability of the estimate over the\nfour window sizes. Finally, I derive a single estimate for \" by averaging over these estimates,\nproviding a further reduction in variance.\nNext, I estimate - of (15) and . of (16) for each interval between di\u00a2culty adjustments,\nto\u00d6ndthetotale\u00a2ciencylossesoverthesampleperiod.41 Foreachintervalbetweendi\u00a2culty\nadjustments, I \u00d6nd the average number of blocks mined per day (the daily mining rate) to\ndetermine the average quantity of bitcoins supplied per day X and then, holding the initial\n2\nlevel of di\u00a2culty ! constant, use the inverse supply curve derived from (9) to estimate the\n1\ncorresponding price p .

From Figure 18 it is clear that there is one\nidenti\u00d6ed period of explosive behavior for the log price time series, when the recursive ADF\nstatistic exceeds the 95% critical value sequence, that is at least one week long. This is\n2017-05-01 to 2018-11-15. The recursive ADF statistic continues to exceed the 99% critical\nvalue sequence for two subsets of this time period. These are 2017-05-20 to 2018-03-30; and\n2018-04-08 to 2018-05-25. From Figure 19, there are seven identi\u00d6ed periods of explosive\nbehavior for the log price time series, when the recursive SADF statistic exceeds the 95%\ncritical value sequence, that are at least one week long. These are 2014-09-28 to 2014-10-08;\n2015-01-13 to 2015-01-20; 2015-11-02 to 2015-11-09; 2016-05-28 to 2016-06-21; 2016-12-22 to\n2017-01-05; 2017-03-01 to 2018-05-22; and 2018-11-19 to 2018-12-16. The recursive SADF\nstatistic continues to exceed the 99% critical value sequence for four subsets of these time\nperiods. These are 2016-06-03 to 2016-06-20; 2016-12-23 to 2017-01-04; 2017-05-19 to 2018-\n03-06; and 2018-11-20 to 2018-12-08. It is clear from comparing Figures 18 and 19 that the\nstrategy based on the recursive SADF test statistic is more sensitive since, at the 5% level of\nsigni\u00d6cance, it identi\u00d6es periods of explosive behavior that are not detected by the strategy\nbased on the recursive ADF test statistic.\nOnce we take into account the fundamental value of the bitcoin, however, it is clear\nfrom Table 4 that the SADF and GSADF statistics for the OLS residuals and the di\u00a7erence\nbetween the log price and the log fundamental value are well below their 10% right-tailed\ncritical values. There is no overwhelming evidence of bubbles in the price of the bitcoin since\nwe cannot reject the null hypothesis of no bubbles at even the 10% signi\u00d6cance level. It fol-\nlows that once we take into account the Bitcoin protocol\u00eds di\u00a2culty adjustment mechanism,\n42", "the explosive behavior that is apparent in the bitcoin price path is explained.\n5.2 Estimating e\u00a2ciency losses\nFor each length of the intervals (7, 9, 11 and 13 days), centered at the time of the di\u00a2culty\nadjustment, the estimates of the elasticity of demand \" are 0:112; 1:16; 0:847; and 0:818,\nrespectively. The average estimate, then, is :73, which demonstrates that there is a fairly\ninelastic demand for the bitcoin. Using this estimate for the elasticity of demand, I estimate\nthe total net e\u00a2ciency losses from 17 March 2014 to 13 January 2019 to be 323.82 million\nUSD.42 Table 5 shows the breakdown of the net losses for each year in the sample period\nand Figure 20 presents a plot of the net e\u00a2ciency losses for each year along with the unique\nlevels of di\u00a2culty over time.43 While the total net losses imply an average annual net loss\nof approximately 66.39 million USD, as shown in Figure 20, the average is misleading as\na measure of the annual costs since the net e\u00a2ciency losses were increasing exponentially\nthroughout the majority of the sample period. Since, from - of (15), the losses are an\nincreasing function of the change in the level of di\u00a2culty !, this is due to the fact that the\nlevel of di\u00a2culty was increasing exponentially during that time. To put these losses into\nperspective, I estimate the total electricity used by the Bitcoin network in terawatt hours\n(TWh), which is provided in the third column of Table 5.44 Assuming an electricity cost\nof 0.05 USD per kWh, the net e\u00a2ciency losses due to adjustments in the level of di\u00a2culty\nas a percentage of the total cost of electricity used to power the Bitcoin network are shown\nin the fourth column of Table 5. Since the electricity used by the Bitcoin network also\n42Iestimatethetotale\u00a2ciencylossestobe390.73millionUSDandthetotale\u00a2ciencybene\u00d6tstobe66.91\nmillionUSD.ThelargemagnitudeoflossesrelativetogainsisinaccordancewithProposition3andbecause\nonly 15.9% of the di\u00a2culty adjustments during the sample period were downward.\n43Note that the \u00d6rst year is only approximately 10 months long due to the length of the sample period.\n44Since the network hashrate is %M gigahashes per second, the terawatt hours used by the network can\n!\nbe estimated as %M * 24 per day, where M is given in (7). While using M to estimate the hashrate\n! 1012 ! !\npresumesthefreeentryofminers, itisconsistentwiththeestimateofe\u00a2ciencylosses,of(15)andbene\u00d6ts\n- of (16), which also presume free entry.\n43", "has been increasing exponentially due to the fact that the level of di\u00a2culty was increasing\nexponentially over the majority of the sample period, the e\u00a2ciency losses as a percentage of\ntotal electricity costs have been fairly stable and are, on average, 9.3% of the total electricity\ncosts.\nIn this section we have seen that while both the SADF and GSADF tests provide ev-\nidence of explosiveness in the bitcoin price path, applying the same tests after specifying\nfundamentals in accordance with the model does not. While there was a signi\u00d6cant di\u00a7er-\nence betweenthe fundamental value of the bitcoinandits price duringlate 2017(as shownin\nFigure 15), the discrepancy does not provide evidence for explosive behavior and hence, even\nduring this time period, there is no evidence of bubble formation. As discussed in Section\n3.1, this discrepancy is probably due to entry barriers not taken into account by the model.\nIt follows that the model is su\u00a2cient to explain any explosive behavior in bitcoin prices.\nThis result provides strong evidence that the boom and bust cycles apparent in the bitcoin\nprice data are not bubbles caused by investor behavior but rather are a consequence of the\neconomic functioning of the Bitcoin protocol. We have also seen that in order to maintain\na constant supply of bitcoins in the market, the protocol imposes e\u00a2ciency losses (bene\u00d6ts)\non contemporaneous consumers and miners of bitcoin whenever the level of di\u00a2culty rises\n(falls). On average, net costs were about 9.3% of the total electricity costs to run the Bitcoin\nnetwork during the sample period.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper has developed a microeconomic model to analyze the economic functioning of\nthe Bitcoin protocol. The model established that the fundamental value of a bitcoin is\nequal to the miners\u00ed equipment and electricity costs relative to their expected block reward\nand fees. While Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer network with no central authority,\n44", "the mechanism for adjusting the level of di\u00a2culty encoded in its protocol amounts to an\nin\u00e1exible system of supply management. Hence, demand shocks have an exaggerated e\u00a7ect\non the price of the bitcoin and each adjustment in the level of di\u00a2culty of mining a bitcoin\nresults in social welfare losses. We have seen that once we specify the fundamentals, which\ninclude the miners\u00ed costs and their expected block reward and fees, there is no evidence of\ntheformationofbubblesinthepriceofthebitcoin. Also, wehaveseenthatthesocialwelfare\nlosses imposed by the protocol\u00eds intervention in the market add up to over 320 million USD\nfrom March 2014 to January 2019. While these costs were incurred by the contemporaneous\nconsumers and miners, it is the eventual holders of bitcoins who bene\u00d6t over time since\nthe price of the bitcoin appreciates by an amount proportional to the rate of increase in\nthe Bitcoin di\u00a2culty level. To the extent that bitcoin mining is not powered by renewable\nresources, we should further take into consideration the external costs of bitcoin production,\nsince electricity generation is one of the leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions. I leave\na thorough analysis of this important issue for future research.\n45", "References\n[1] Antonopoulos, A. (2017): Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain.

economic effects of the Bitcoin protocol. I view the bitcoin as a tradable commodity that is produced by miners and whose supply is managed by the protocol. The findings show that bitcoin\u2019s volatile price path and inefficiency are related, and that both are a consequence of the protocol\u2019s system of supply management. I characterize the fundamental value of a bitcoin and demonstrate that the return on bitcoin appreciates proportionally to the rate of increase in the level of difficulty. In the model, where the price of a bitcoin is based on marginal production costs, successive positive demand shocks result in a rapidly increasing price path that may be mistaken for a bubble. The generalized supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test is used to demonstrate that the model is able to account for the explosive behavior in the bitcoin price path, providing strong evidence that bitcoin is not a bubble. I also show that the difficulty adjustment mechanism results in social welfare losses from 17 March 2014 to 13 January 2019 of $323.8 million, which is about 9.3% of the miners\u2019 total electricity costs during this time period.", "Title": "Bursting the Bitcoin Bubble: Assessing the Fundamental Value and Social Costs of Bitcoin"}}
