The results of all this investment have been mixed \nat best. Most PDMCs are just as heavily reliant today on externally financed technical assistance \nand training and other means to build capacity as they have ever been. \n\nA review, entitled Governance in the Pacific: Focus for Action 2005\u20132009, funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), concluded that \u201cinadequate capacity building, coupled with the loss \nof senior staff who have management and technical skills, is common in many Pacific DMCs.\u201d \nThe ADB review noted that \u201cthe failure of most Pacific DMCs to train and retain many of their \nmost skilled and motivated people, especially in Polynesia but increasingly in other countries, \nis  a  long-standing  contributor  to  concerns  over  the  quality  of  governance  and  institutions.\u201d \nFurthermore, according to ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy for 2005\u20132009, \u201ctoo often, capacity building \nhas been related to the objectives of the project rather than to those of the host organization, or \ncapacity building requirements have been insufficiently analyzed, planned, or coordinated.\u201d\n\nThe continuing need to build domestic capacity remains important for three key result areas of \nADB\u2019s Pacific strategy: (i) establishing an effective institutional framework for developing skills \nin response to labor market demands; (ii) managing and delivering quality basic social services; \nand (iii) strengthening capacity of PDMC governments, civil society, and private sector groups \nto plan and manage for development results.\n\nDespite the historical challenges and shortcomings, public sector capacity has been successfully \nbuilt and sustained in each of the PDMCs. Central government departments, for example, have \nbuilt and sustained their capacity to supply improved health and education services. In some \nPDMCs, state-owned  enterprises have strengthened and maintained  their capacity to provide \nefficient and effective services to the public, while independent authorities have been established \nand have successfully maintained their ability to deliver services. In addition, civil society groups \nin  the  region  have  enhanced  their  capacity  to  mobilize  communities,  advocate  reforms,  and \ndeliver services to Pacific island communities. \n\nAs noted in the cases  described in this study, the \u201csuccesses\u201d can be attributed to a number \nof  factors,  such  as  strong  leadership,  effective  community  participation  or  demand,  solid \nunderstanding  of  the  programming  context,  getting  the  incentives  right,  or  effective  use  of \ntechnical  advisors.  However,  our  understanding  of  the  reasons  for  success  has  tended  to  be \nproject  or  program  specific,  or  anecdotal,  and  after  decades  of  external  assistance  to  build \ncapacity in the Pacific, it is time that the Pacific stakeholders and their development partners \nbetter  understand  how  capacity  can  be  successfully  built  and  sustained.  This  study  seeks  to \ncontribute to that objective.\n\nForeword  vii\n\n\fCapacity development has long been a challenge for PDMCs and something of an enigma for \nexternal assistance agencies. A basic problem is, as the author of this report, Joe Bolger, observes, \nthat capacity development in the Pacific can be seen as \u201ca prism-like phenomenon that yields \ndifferent images depending on how you look at it.\u201d To capture all perspectives of this prism, the \nstudy contracted a series of 20 case studies from 11 countries across the region, prepared primarily \nby consultants from the Pacific islands. They cover a range of programming experiences\u2014from \neconomic planning, to infrastructure development, health and legal sector reform, civil society \nenhancement, fisheries, and one regional initiative. The cases include programming funded by \nvarious bilateral and multilateral donors.\n\nThe study contains analyses and recommendations on the approaches to capacity development \nthat work best and the conditions that have been conducive to their success, the unique challenges \nfaced by PDMCs in addressing capacity constraints, and the implications for future interventions \nat both the strategic and operational levels.\n\nA separate report, entitled A Framework for Capacity Development in the Pacific Islands, by \nMichael Heppell, explores the capacity needs and prerequisites for capacity development of critical \ngovernment agencies in PDMCs. It includes a framework to establish appropriate conditions for \nfuture capacity development interventions, and a regional action plan.\n\nI hope that the findings and recommendations contained in these two reports will help guide \nfuture capacity building efforts in the Pacific. \n\nFinally,  I  would  like  to  express  my  gratitude  to  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment for cofinancing this initiative and offering valuable technical advice. I would also \nbe remiss if I did not express sincere appreciation for the collaboration of participating PDMCs \nand other donor agencies without whose cooperation this study would not have been possible. \n\nSultan Hafeez Rahman\nDirector General\nPacific Department\n\n viii \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fACKnowleDgeMent\n\nThe author would like to thank the following people for their support during the research phase \nand in the preparation of this report.  First of all, a nod of gratitude to Steve Pollard, the ADB \ntask manager for this initiative, whose support and guidance throughout was always coupled \nwith a dose of good humor. Thanks also to Melissa Dayrit, , Ophelia Iriberri and Tara Mehretab of \nADB\u2019s Pacific department (PARD) for pulling together documentation, organizing meetings and \nworkshops, and otherwise helping to move the process forward. Alexander Pascual for excellent \nlayout. ADB consultant Pete Malvicini\u2019s facilitation of the Sydney writeshop and the Manila \nretreat also helped to animate the process and keep us on target.\n\nAdditional  thanks  to  Mike  Heppell  for  his  feedback  on  the  final  draft  report,  to  the  other \nconsultants  who  reviewed  the  individual  case  studies,  Patricia  Lyon  of  AusAID  for  her  wise \ncounsel, and Heather Baser for reviewing a draft report and contributing, in particular, to the \ncontent on technical assistance. And a special thanks to Jay Maclean for his patient editing of \nthe final document.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, a special note of appreciation to my Pacific colleagues for their \nwisdom,  insights,  hospitality,  and  friendship.  Without  them,  none  of  this  would  have  been \npossible. \n\nAs always, any shortcomings or errors are solely the responsibility of the author.  \n\nAcknowledgement \n\nix\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank \n\n\fexeCutIVe SuMMARy\n\nIn 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors adopted capacity development \n(CD) as a thematic priority. ADB staff since developed a medium-term framework and action plan \nfor strengthening assistance for CD in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). The action \nplan  calls  for  ADB-sponsored  CD  efforts  to  be  more  efficient,  effective,  and  demand-driven. \nMore effective CD interventions should contribute to better and more sustainable results by DMC \norganizations and groups, and ultimately to improved quality and coverage of public services, \nas well as reduced poverty in the region. \n\nTo advance this agenda and better understand CD in the Pacific region, ADB\u2019s Pacific department \ncommissioned a regional study in the latter part of 2006. The study is based on 20 case studies \nfrom 11 countries across the region, prepared by Pacific island consultants. This report includes \nfindings and recommendations that have benefited from inputs from an August 2007 capacity \ndevelopment retreat at ADB headquarters. ADB intends to use the findings and recommendations \nof the study to guide future capacity-building efforts in the Pacific. \n\nThe cases chosen for the study represent a cross section of experiences in the region by sector, \nthematic  area,  and  source  of  funding.  They  cover  programming  experiences  from  economic \nplanning, to infrastructure development, health and legal sector reform, civil society enhancement, \nfisheries,  and  one  regional  initiative.  The  study  also  explored  approaches  to  CD  relying  on \ndifferent modalities. While the research was intended to reflect a wide range of experiences, \nrelatively greater weight was given to initiatives considered by stakeholders to be \u201dsuccessful.\u201d \nInitiatives that were contemporary, including some that would help to deepen understanding of \nemerging practices in the region, were also emphasized. \n\nCapacity Development: the Concept \n\nIncreased  interest  in  CD  in  the  1980s  onward  has  largely  been  a  response  to  acknowledged \nshortcomings  in  development  assistance,  in  particular,  concerns  about  the  effectiveness  of \ntechnical assistance and the sustainability of capacity gains. Over the years, the concept has \nevolved with increased attention to capacity of larger systems,\u201csoft capacities,\u201d and recognition \nthat CD is strongly context and situation specific. The discussion of CD in this report is guided \nby the definition developed by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and adopted by ADB:\n\n\u201cCapacity development is the process whereby people, organizations, and society as a whole \nunleash, strengthen, create, adapt and maintain capacity over time.\u201d\n\nExecutive Summary  xi\n\n\foverview of Findings \n\nMost  of  the  case  studies  reflected  a  tendency, \nnot  unique  to  the  Pacific  region,  to  think  of \ncapacity primarily  in  terms  of individual skills \nor  organizational  competencies.  \u201dCapacity \ndevelopment\u201d  is,  thus,  frequently  equated \nwith  training  or  support  for  some  type  of \norganizational  development  process.  Few  of \nthe  cases  demonstrated  a  systematic  approach \nto  analyzing  or  addressing  capacity  issues \nduring  the  planning  and  design  stages  or  in \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  However,  some  of \nthe  experiences  highlighted  movement  toward \na broader sense of CD, that is, to more attention \nto  capacity  \u201dsystems,\u201d  interorganizational \nconcerns,  or  enabling  conditions,  even  if  not \nalways articulated in CD terms. \n\nThe study identifies different approaches to, or \nentry points for CD in the Pacific, including those \nfocusing on individual skills and competencies, \norganizational  capacity,  interorganizational \ncollaboration, effective use of existing capacity, \ngap filling, and policy and institutional reform. \nThe  study  also  examines  several  examples  of \nincreasing  Pacific  island  capacity  to  further \ndevelop its own capacity. Such CD efforts focused \non empowering community groups, including use \nof innovative financing mechanisms for capacity \nstrengthening, as well as one regional approach \nto CD. One case study looked at a community-\nbased CD initiative that involved no donors.  \n\nSeveral key factors influencing \u201dsuccess\u201d in the \ncase studies were found, including participation \nand ownership, leadership and vision, capacity \nto demand, relevance, readiness and receptivity, \ninvesting in understanding, getting the incentives \nright, an enabling environment, flexibility and \n\n xii \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\u201c\u2026the ultimate goal of capacity \ndevelopment programs is to support \nthe development of better skilled and \noriented individuals, more responsive \nand effective institutions and a better \npolicy environment for pursuing \ndevelopment objectives. A key message \nis the importance of going beyond mere \nskills transfer towards supporting country \nleadership and strategic decision-making, \naccountability systems, and a culture \nof learning and innovation. ... Capacity \ndevelopment is as much about skills and \nsystems as it is about incentives and \nbehavior; much more than a technical \nexercise, capacity development is rooted \nin the political economy of a country\u2026\u201d\n\nOperational Task  Force  on  Capacity  Development  in  Africa \n(World  Bank),  \u201dEffective  States  and  Engaged  Societies: \nCapacity  Development  for  Growth,  Service  Delivery, \nEmpowerment and Security in Africa,\u201d 4 April 2005.\n\n\u201cLong-term development should be a \nnationally led and managed process that \nbuilds upon existing capacity in designing \nand implementing effective strategies \nto further boost capacity development. \nOur approach in nurturing MDG-based \nnational development strategies integrates \ncapacity diagnostics and strategies \ninto the heart of that process. Capacity \ndevelopment must be taken into the core \nof development planning, policy and \nfinancing if it is not to be an ineffective \nadd-on or after-thought.

These include: significant gaps in \ncapacity in strategically important areas\u2014such as trade and telecommunications\u2014regular outflows \nof  human  capital  (for  some  PDMCs),  weak  undiversified  economies,  relatively  young  states \noften struggling with issues of legitimacy, ongoing tensions between modern and traditional \ninstitutions, and limited capacity for effective demand. However, the region exhibits a multitude \nof diverse conditions, even within individual countries. In addition, there are particular capacity \nchallenges in fragile and post-conflict states in the region.  \n\nFour themes emerge from the study: the importance of (i) understanding the context; (ii) thinking \nstrategically  about  capacity\u2014the  dynamics  of  the  capacity  system,  soft  capacities  (such  as \nleadership, legitimacy,  trust, motivations, and values), the relationship between capacity and \nperformance, and the role to be played by the external intervener; (iii) programming strategically \nfor sustainable capacity; and (iv) learning from experience.\n\nImplications for ADB\n\nA number of possible implications for ADB, bilateral donors, and DMCs arise from the study in \nterms of their approach to CD. Three areas are seen to be of particular significance to ADB: \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nInstitutionalizing  a  CD  approach  in  ADB\u2019s  country  programs,  for  example,  by \nstrengthening  mechanisms  to  ensure  a  better  understanding  of  the  programming \ncontext as a basis for the country partnership strategy; \n\nEnhancing capacity development programming, such as through demand-driven pilots, \nfostering new approaches, and increased reliance on local capacity-building options; \nand\n\nUpdating ADB\u2019s business processes and internal support systems. This would include \nstrengthening  internal  capacity  for  CD  and  modifying  consultant  selection  and \nrecruitment processes. A number of the options for moving forward draw on the work \nof ADB\u2019s capacity development working group and recent ADB reviews of technical \nassistance effectiveness and programming in weakly performing countries. \n\nExecutive Summary  xiii\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank \n\n\fExecutive Summary  xv\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank \n\n\fI. \n\n  \n\nIntRoDuCtIon\n\nWhat  are  the  three  most  important  things?

Background \n\nThe  idea  of  capacity  development  (CD)  has  gained  increasing \nprominence in the international development community over \nthe  past  two  decades.  In  1993,  World  Bank  Vice  President \nEdward  (Kim)  Jaycox  declared  CD  to  be  \u201cthe  missing  link  in \nAfrican  development.\u201d  In  1997,  the  Development  Assistance \nCommittee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD) issued the document Shaping the 21st \nCentury [ 1 ],  which  described  a  new  approach  to  development \ncooperation, including greater emphasis on CD within \u201ceffective \npartnerships.\u201d In 2004, Francis Fukuyama [ 2 ] declared that donors \nshould define capacity as the primary objective of all development \nassistance, rather than  focusing  on services, infrastructure, or \nother results. \n\n  OECD-DAC, Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Cooperation, Paris, May, \n1996.\n Fukuyama 2004. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\nIntroduction  1\n\n\fIn  2005,  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness  affirmed \nthe  importance  of  CD,  as  well  as  ownership,  harmonization, \nalignment,  results,  and  mutual  accountability.  The  Paris \nDeclaration  specifically  described  \u201ccapacity  to  plan,  manage, \nimplement and account for results of policies and programmes \n(as) critical for achieving development objectives from analysis \nand  dialogue  through  implementation,  monitoring  and \nevaluation.\u201d These references to CD were embraced under the \nPacific Principles for Effective Aid. [ 3 ]\n\nIn 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted CD as a \nthematic priority and viewed strengthening developing-country \ncapacity not only as a means to enhance performance but also \nas a goal in its own right. ADB has since developed a medium-\nterm framework and action plan [ 4 ] for strengthening assistance \nfor CD in developing member countries (DMCs). ADB\u2019s action \nplan calls for ADB-sponsored CD efforts to be more efficient, \neffective, and demand-driven. More effective CD interventions \nwith  DMC  partners  are  expected  to  contribute  to  better  and \nmore sustainable results by DMC organizations and groups that \nwill help them realize intermediate outcomes, such as improved \nservice delivery and better legal and regulatory enforcement. \nThe anticipated long-term impact is better quality and expanded \ncoverage of public services, and ultimately reduced poverty in \nthe region. The action plan also reaffirms ADB\u2019s commitment, \narticulated  in  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness,  to \nincrease  the  \u201calignment  of  their  aid  with  partner  countries\u2019 \npriorities,  systems  and  procedures  and  helping  to  strengthen \ntheir capacities.\u201d\n\nThe objectives outlined in ADB\u2019s medium-term framework and \naction plan are highly relevant to the Pacific region, given the \nnumber of weakly performing countries. Many countries in the \nPacific are constrained by policy and institutional weaknesses \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n Two of the Pacific aid effectiveness principles refer specifically to capacity development (the \ncorresponding Paris Declaration Principles are noted in parentheses): Principle 5: Strengthened \ninstitutional mechanisms and capacity in countries to enable increased use of local systems by \ndevelopment partners. (Paris Declaration 17, 21, 22-24, 31; Indicator 4, 6, 8). Principle 6: (i) \nProvision of technical assistance (TA), including in aid coordination/management, in such a \nway that ensures that capacity is built with tangible benefits to the country to support national \nownership. Provision of an appropriate level of counterpart resources through established \nprocedures and mechanisms. (ii) Short-term TA, that addresses local skills gaps to conduct \nstudies, is culturally sensitive. (Paris Declaration 22\u201324; Indicator 4).\nADB 2006g.\n\n 2 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fand  limited  organizational  or  individual  capacity,  while  some \ncountries have been badly affected by conflict in recent years, \nwith its attendant capacity implications. \n\nADB\u2019s Pacific department (PARD) commissioned a regional study \nin  2006  to  better  understand  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and \napproaches of Pacific governments and development partners, \nincluding  civil  society  actors,  in  CD.  ADB  intends  to  use  the \nfindings and recommendations to guide future capacity-building \nefforts in the Pacific. The study was based on a series of 20 case \nstudies from 11 countries across the region, prepared mainly by \nPacific island consultants (see Appendix 1 for a list of cases and \nresearchers).  A  questionnaire  was  provided  to  the  consultants \nas the basis for developing  each  case study (Appendix 2). An \ninterim report was presented at a workshop at ADB headquarters \nin August 2007. The report was modified based on feedback from \nworkshop participants. \n\nThe study, and associated dialogue with regional partners, also \nsupports ADB\u2019s objective of \u201cforming successful partnerships in \nthe Pacific islands to build public sector capacity as a means to \nguiding more effective CD interventions in the future.\u201d \n\nB. \n\n Scope of Study and the Process\n\nThis  study  had  three  phases.  During  the  first  phase,  the  team \nleader  met  ADB  and  other  donor  agency  representatives  in \nAustralia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines to (i) establish \nkey  issues  from  donor  experience;  (ii)  produce  a  long  list  of \npossible  case  studies;  (iii)  validate  the  proposed  focus  of  the \nstudy; and (iv) suggest a process for further Pacific island country \nreviews and for further donor discussions, while preparing an \ninitial framework for the case studies. \n\nThe second phase entailed identification and hiring of consultant \nresearchers from the Pacific Islands and preparation of the first \ngroup of case studies to affirm key issues and themes. These case \nstudies were presented by the researchers at an ADB-sponsored \n\u201dwriteshop\u201d in Sydney in April 2007. Based on feedback from \nwriteshop participants (i.e., the other researchers, plus selected \nresource  persons  and  donor  representatives),  the  researchers \n\n \n\n \n\nIntroduction  3\n\n\ffinalized their reports with the support of resource persons [ 5 ]\nand the team leader. \n\nAt the writeshop, Pacific islanders suggested follow-up on this \ninitiative in the region. Toward that end, Vaine Wichman, the \ncase researcher from the Cook Islands, made a presentation on \nthe study at the July 2007 Forum Economic Ministers Meeting \n(FEMM) in Palau. \n\nThe  August  2007  workshop  in  Manila  was  part  of  the  third \nphase  of  the  study.  It  provided  an  opportunity  to  present  the \ninterim  findings  and  to  reflect  on  options  for  moving  the  CD \nagenda  forward  in  PARD.  Participants  included  PARD  staff, \nselected  Pacific  island  consultants,  resource  persons,  donor \nrepresentatives, and the team leader. The workshop was followed \nby  a  session  with  donors  on  20\u201321  August,  at  which  ADB \nreported the study findings. \n\nThe cases chosen for the study represent a cross section of experiences \nin the region by sector and thematic area, as well as source of funding. \nMost of the cases were ADB-funded initiatives, with others being \nsupported by the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID),  New  Zealand\u2019s  International  Aid  and  Development \nAgency (NZAID), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), \nand the World Bank. The cases covered programming experiences \nfrom economic planning to infrastructure development, health and \nlegal sector reform, civil society enhancement, fisheries, and one \nregional initiative. The study also explored the different approaches \nto CD (including bilateral projects, advisory support, sector reforms, \nand TA facilities) and different country experiences, including post-\nconflict countries. The distribution of the studies is shown below.\n\nSector or thematic Area\n\nPublic Sector Reform\nEconomic Sector\nSocial Sector \nCivil Society Enhancement\nTechnical Assistance Management\nHarmonization \nCountry Strategy Development\nTrust Funds\nRegional \n\nnumber of Cases\n\n7\n3\n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n5 \n\n Resource persons have included Tony Hughes (Solomon Islands), Lynn Pieper (Timor-\nLeste), Tim O\u2019Meara (Samoa), and Steve Pollard (Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, \nNauru, Tuvalu).

It  also  examines  country-specific  issues  and \ngives some details of capacity challenges in the Pacific region, \nas well as in fragile or post-conflict states.\n\nThe  conclusions  section  draws  out  key  themes  and  issues \nemerging from the research, such as the importance of context, \nthinking  strategically  about  capacity,  and  the  sustainability \nchallenge.\n\n \n\n \n\nIntroduction  5\n\n\fThe final sections of the report outline some of the implications \nfor ADB arising from the research. These include considerations \nrelating to development of country strategies, CD programming \n(including use of technical advisors), and ADB\u2019s internal systems \nand business processes.\n\nD. \n\n limitations\n\nSome limitations should be noted. First, the preliminary scoping \nstudy by the team leader was not as extensive as planned, due \nto cancellation of a visit to meet various stakeholders in Fiji as \na result of the coup there in December 2006. \n\nSecond, the Pacific island consultants tasked with preparing the \ncase studies were given a challenging task. They had to immerse \nthemselves  in  the  complexities  of  CD  over  a  relatively  short \ntime and were asked to prepare the cases using a story-telling \napproach.  Ultimately,  the  case  studies  reflect  our  collective, \nongoing learning about what CD actually means in the Pacific \nin the early days of the 21st century, while hopefully being true \nto Pacific story-telling traditions.  \n\n 6 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fII.\n\nCAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\nA.   why Capacity Development? origins \n\nand evolution of the Concept \n\nIncreased  interest  in  CD  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  was  largely \na  response  to  acknowledged  shortcomings  in  development \nassistance over the preceding 40 years, in particular, concerns \nabout the effectiveness of technical assistance (TA) and limited \napparent success in realizing sustainable capacity gains. This led \nincreasingly to calls for more systematic and holistic approaches, \nand with greater emphasis on country ownership and sustainable \nresults. \n\nSince  CD  came  to  the  fore  in  the  1990s,  numerous  reports, \nstudies, papers, and official donor documents have reflected an \nincreasingly  sophisticated  perspective  on  the  concept.  Recent \ntrends in thinking about CD include the following: [ 6 ]\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nMovement  away  from  thinking  exclusively  about \nindividual and organizational capacity to capacity of \nnetworks and larger systems.\nGreater  recognition  of  the  importance  of  \u201csoft \ncapacities,\u201d such as leadership, relationships, legitimacy, \nincentives, motivations, and culture.\nRecognition that CD is a dynamic process and strongly \ncontext and situation specific\u2014no \u201cone size fits all.\u201d \nCD cannot be \u201crolled out from the top;\u201d it is a process \nof \u201cdecentralized social learning.\u201d\nCD  is  not  necessarily  neutral;  it  can  change,  or  can \nbe affected by social, political, cultural, and economic \nrelations. \n\n6 \n\n  Ubels et al. 2005. \n\nCapacity Development  7\n\n\fwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\fB.  what Do we Mean by \n\nCapacity Development?\n\nThis discussion of CD is guided by the definition developed by \nthe DAC and adopted by ADB, among other agencies:\n\n\u201cCapacity development is the process whereby people, \norganizations,  and  society  as  a  whole  unleash, \nstrengthen, create, adapt, and maintain capacity over \ntime.\u201d\n\nThis  definition  highlights  several  important  considerations: \nthe  idea  of  CD  as  a  multidimensional  phenomenon  (i.e., \ninvolving  people,  organizations,  and  society  as  a  whole)  that \nis  country-owned,  open  to  the  lessons  of  experience  and  the \nflexibility to modify approaches, while maintaining a focus on \nsustainability.\n\nHowever,  as  Morgan, [  7  ]  among  others,  noted,  numerous \nframeworks have been developed to improve analysis of capacity \nissues, each of which reflects a different theory of change or view \nof human behavior. The various CD frameworks or perspectives \ndraw on different disciplines or bodies of knowledge, including \norganizational  development,  political  economy,  institutional \neconomics,  strategic  management,  and  systems  thinking  or \ncomplexity theory. \n\nThis report acknowledges the value of all of these perspectives, \neach of which was represented in varying degrees in the case \nstudies. Some cases, for example, emphasized systems thinking as \na way of understanding and responding to capacity challenges. \nThis  reflected  the  reality  observed  in  many  of  the  cases  that \ninvolved  complex  change  processes  involving  multiple  actors \noperating within and across diverse systems. Other cases focused \nmore  on  political  economy  issues,  strategic  management,  or \napplication of organizational development principles.\n\nBeyond the diverse views on capacity development alluded to \nhere, there is general agreement on certain underlying principles \nand  orientations  that  collectively  distinguish  CD  from  other \napproaches to, or perspectives on, development. The principles \nare that CD is based on\n\n\u2022\t\n\nbroad-based participation and a locally driven \nagenda,\n\n7 Morgan 2006.  \n\nCapacity Development  9\n\n\f\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\nunderstanding of the context,\nbuilding on local capacities, \nongoing learning and adaptation,\nlong-term investments,\nintegration of activities at various levels to address \ncomplex problems.\n\nC.   the \u201cHow to\u201d of Capacity Development \n\nThe  strategies  or  \u201dhow  to\u201d  of  CD  embraced  by  practitioners, \nmanagers,  or  analysts  usually  reflect  the  school  of  thought \nto  which  they  subscribe.  Nongovernment  organizations,  for \nexample, tend to follow an organizational development model, \ndrawing  occasionally  on  political  economy  analyses.  Private \nsector  organizational  specialists  tend  to  think  in  terms  of \ninstitutional  economics\u2014supply  and  demand  and  incentives \nthat drive behavior. Some donors, such as the United Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  draw  on  a \npolitical economy perspective emphasizing power and \u201ddrivers of \nchange.\u201d Most other donor agencies tend to take an instrumental \nview of capacity issues, relying on strategic management tools \nand results-based management, with a particular emphasis on \ntechnical  and  managerial  capacities  required  for  performance \nimprovement, often to the relative exclusion of social, political, \nor cultural dimensions that might influence behavior.\n\nOperational strategies for CD [ 8 ] include\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\neliminating old or inappropriate capacity,\nreducing demand on existing capacity,\nmaking better use of existing capacity and strengthening \nit,\nproviding  space  for  innovation  or  creative  use  of \ncapacities, and\ncreating new capacity.\n\nExperience  suggests  that  project  or  program  planners  often \ngravitate  instinctively  toward  strengthening  capacity  or \ncreating new capacity (through training or by focusing on new \norganizational structures) in response to development problems. \n\n 10 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n8 Morgan 1998. \n\n\fHowever, this has frequently proven to be inadequate, particularly \nwhen  dealing  with  deeply  rooted  political  or  socioeconomic \nproblems. \n\nThe  tendency  toward  \u201ddeveloping\u201d  new  capacity  has  also  led \nmany observers to suggest that other options, such as making \nbetter use of existing capacity, should be considered first in the \ninterest of sustainability and local ownership. The latter might \ninvolve,  for  example,  reviewing  an  organization\u2019s  incentive \nsystems (e.g., benefits, incentives, opportunities for professional \nadvancement) before committing to a significant investment in \ntraining. Similarly, promoting collaboration among organizations \n(e.g., a coalition of health agencies) may lead to better use of \nexisting capacity and be more effective than seeking to redress \ncapacity gaps in each organization.\n\nD.   ADB\u2019s Approach to Capacity \n\nDevelopment\n\nAs noted above, ADB has endorsed the DAC\u2019s definition of CD. \nHowever,  ADB  also  recognizes  the  multiplicity  of  definitions \nand  that  different  stakeholders  have  their  own  definition  or \ncharacterization of capacity and CD. ADB\u2019s framework and action \nplan rely on a template that draws on common features from \nvarious definitions but allows the Pacific countries to determine \ntheir  own  definition  or  concept  of  CD.  ADB\u2019s  perspective  on \nCD is rooted in an assumption that public sector agencies will \nremain the key entry points for ADB\u2019s CD operations, but that \nother key organizations and groups, such as the private sector \nand civil society, also have significant roles to play. \n\nADB\u2019s  CD  framework  is  based  on  a  systems  perspective  with \nthree  main  dimensions:  (i)  organizations,  (ii)  institutions, and \n(iii)  interorganizational  and/or  group  relations.  As  illustrated \nin Figure 1, entry points for CD can be at the organizational, \ninstitutional, or network/partnership level. The framework also \nacknowledges the possibility of interventions that cut across the \nsystem,  dealing  simultaneously  or  sequentially  with  capacity \nissues at different levels.\n\nCapacity Development  11\n\n\fFigure 1: Framework for Capacity Development\n\nPlanning and Implementation\nPoverty Reduction Strategic \nPublic Financial Management\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\noRg1\n\nS u b n atio n al/Local \nG overn a nce\nA nticorru ptio n\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\nInstitutional \nContext\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\nAdministrative and \nLegislative Reform\nLegal and Judicial Reform\n\n\u0083\n\n \n\nP\n\na\nr\n\nS\n\no\n\nci\n\ntici\n\np\n\nD\n\ne\n\ncisi\n\no\n\ne\nt\ny i\nn\n \nP\n\na\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nn\n\nu\n\n o\nf C\ni\nv\nil \n\nb\n\nlic \n\noRg4\n\nnetwork/Partnership\nCommunications and interactions \nWith clients, networks, and partners \n\norganization, group\n\norganization Mandate and objective\n \u0083\nPolicies and performance targets\n\nInternal Management Dimensions\n \u0083\n Clarity of mandate/leadership\n \u0083\nAbility to plan, monitor, and learn\n \u0083\nSystems orientation (internal and \nexternal)\nAdequate structures and processes\nFinancial and Human resources\nTechnology & infrastructure\n\n \u0083\n \u0083\n \u0083\n\noRg3\n\noRg2\n\nImpact\n \u0083\n \u0083\n \u0083\n\nEffectiveness\nEfficiency\nSustainability\n\nCD intervention point\n\nSource: ADB capacity development working group discussions\n\nADB\u2019s  medium-term  framework  and  action  plan  distinguish \nbetween  capacity  development  and  governance,  noting: \n\u201cGovernance and CD differ insofar as governance is a normative \nconcept that identifies certain standards, such as transparency \nand accountability, and measures country circumstances against \nthese standards. In contrast, CD places emphasis on achieving \nobjectives identified by DMC organizations and other relevant \nstakeholders. CD is instrumental to achieve governance objectives \nas it is to achieve environment, gender or sector objectives.\u201d [ 9 ] \nThe  action  plan  also  notes  that  governance  and  capacity \ndevelopment  are  mutually  supportive,  because  realization  of \ngovernance objectives, such as improved accountability, often \nrequires an investment in capacity just as strengthening capacity \nfrequently depends on adequate governance conditions. \n\nFinally, it is worth reiterating that ADB has endorsed the Paris \nDeclaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness,  with  its  commitments  to \nincreased  country  ownership,  harmonization,  alignment,  and \ncapacity development.\n\n 12 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n9 \n\nADB 2006g. p. 15. \n\n\fIII.\n\ntHe StuDy - oVeRVIew \noF FInDIngS\n\nData for this review came from various sources, including the \ncase studies, articles, papers, reviews, and evaluations relating \nto  CD  and  aid  effectiveness  (See  references  and  additional \nsource material). Information on ADB initiatives also came from \nevaluations and technical assistance completion reports prepared \nby ADB staff. It should be noted that while ADB has recently \nintroduced a classification system for CD, it is only beginning to \nreport on CD systematically. At this stage, most of the focus in \nCD reporting is on \u201dquality-at-entry\u201d considerations. \n\nAusAID  staff  and  consultants  also  provided  material  for  this \nreview,  including  evaluation  reports  and  lessons-learned \ndocuments that capture AusAID\u2019s experience in CD in a range \nof sectors and thematic areas. \n\nA.  Conceptualization and Planning of \n\nCapacity Development Programming\n\n1. \n\nArticulation of Capacity Issues\n\nOne aspect of this study was to learn how PDMC stakeholders \nthink about \u201ccapacity\u201d and what \u201ccapacity development\u201d means \nto them\u2014conceptually and operationally. Most of the cases, as \nwell as the material reviewed for the study, reflect a tendency, not \nunique to the Pacific region, to think of \u201ccapacity\u201d primarily in \nterms of individual skills or organizational competencies. Thus, \n\u201ccapacity development\u201d is frequently equated with training or \nsupport for some type of organizational development process. \n\nThis perspective is reflected in Esekia Solofa\u2019s case study on the \nSamoa Public Sector Improvement Facility which notes: \u201cEver \nsince the start of the New Zealand scholarship scheme for Samoa \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  13\n\n\f(which predated Samoa\u2019s independence by several years), Samoa \nhas always understood the capacity building and development \npurpose  behind  aid,  although  in  its  narrow  sense  of  human \nresource development (HRD).\u201d [ 10 ]\n\nHowever, some cases highlight movement toward an emerging \ninternational  \u201cconsensus\u201d  on  CD,  with  increased  attention  to \ncapacity systems, interorganizational relationships and enabling \nconditions, even if they are not always articulated in CD terms. \n\nThe way capacity and CD are conceived in the Pacific region was \nseen as worthy of attention because much of the literature, guides, \ntool boxes, etc., on CD has emerged from the donor community; \nand  CD  is  consistently  referred  to  in  those  documents  as  an \nendogenous or locally-driven process. The question that arises \nis whose view or concept prevails. Is it the definition adopted by \ndonors through the DAC, which sees CD as endogenous process, \nbased on a notion of levels and a systemic approach, [ 11 ] or is \nit a conceptualization that focuses largely on human resource \ndevelopment and the capabilities  of  individual organizations? \nOr are we seeing a convergence of views over time? The cases \nsuggest there is some convergence, although the language and \npractices between donors and developing-country partners still \ndiffer.\n\n2. \n\nCapacity Assessment Processes\n\nConsistent  with  the  perspectives  on  CD  noted  above,  few  of \nthe  cases  revealed  a  systematic  approach  to  analyzing  or \naddressing  capacity  issues  during  the  planning  and  design \nstages.  To  the  extent  that  it  was  done,  there  was  a  tendency \nto  focus  on  \u201ccapacity  gaps\u201d  or  deficiencies,  but  with  limited \nsystematic  attention  to  capacity  systems,  e.g.,  the  capacity  of \norganizations to work together, or the potentially constraining \nimpact  of  \u201ccapacity-negative\u201d  policies  or  institutional  rules. \nThe cases also demonstrated little attention specifically to soft \ncapacities, such as leadership, legitimacy, values, or identity as \n\n10 \n11 \n\n Solofa 2007a. p. 14.\n  DAC uses the term \u201dsystemic approach\u201d to refer to the interaction \nbetween capacity levels (individual, organizational, and enabling \nenvironment). This language is used interchangeably throughout this \nreport with the idea of a systems approach or systems thinking, with \na recognition that the latter is backed up by a much more complex \nbody of theory, which we do not endeavor to unbundle.\n\n 14 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fpart of the assessment process. This does not necessarily mean \nthat stakeholders were not attentive to such issues, rather, that \nthey simply were not part of the formal assessment process. \n\nAmong the exceptions was the Tuvalu Trust Fund case, which \nincorporated a more purposeful approach to capacity issues from \nthe  start.  The  Government  requested  technical  assistance  (TA) \nfrom ADB to develop the idea of a trust fund into a project. It was \nagreed that the approach would, among other things: \u201cDetermine \nthe critical success factors for capacity development at the island \nlevel  and  develop  a  model  that  could  be  applied,  building  on \nstrengths  and  supporting  weaknesses.\u201d [ 12 ]  The  TA  focused  on \nstrengthening the capacity of central and local governments in \nplanning, managing, and implementing development projects.\n\nSimilarly,  the  Provincial  Performance  Improvement  Initiative \n(PPII), an AusAID-funded project in Papua New Guinea (PNG), \nhas  built  on  an  extensive  diagnosis  of  service  delivery  in  the \ncountry while its own feasibility study examined key institutional \nconstraints.  The  latter  was  followed  in  PPII\u2019s  first  phase  by  a \n\u201csystematic analysis of the capacities of the provincial, district \nand local level government administration in relation to service \ndelivery.\u201d [ 13 ] This led in turn to provincial corporate plans and \nprovided  a  basis  for  supporting  CD  plans  for  participating \nprovinces. \n\nThe  designs  of  other  cases  were  clearly  responsive  to  shifts \nwithin broader capacity systems that often opened up space to \nadvance new policies or ways of using or strengthening domestic \ncapacity. However, they were not usually informed by detailed \ncapacity analyses leading to specific CD plans, as in PPII. \n\n3.  Role of PDMC Stakeholders\n\nThe extent to which  PDMC stakeholders were involved in  the \nplanning and design of CD interventions varied among the case \nstudies. Most of the countries in the study are considered fragile \nstates or weakly performing countries, which means that they \noften have limited capacity to engage in assessment and design \nprocesses.  ADB\u2019s  2007  report  on  weakly  performing  countries \n\n12  Bell 2007. p. 2.\n13  Saldanha 2007. p. 3.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  15\n\n\faddresses  this  issue  and  the  associated  challenges,  including \nhow to promote ownership when capacity is weak and national \ninstitutions are fragile. [ 14 ]\n\nNevertheless, a great deal of the success in the case studies can \nbe attributed to the engagement of local stakeholders, whether \nthrough consultative processes, participatory designs, or outright \nleadership in identification, planning, and design. The pattern for \nengagement varied significantly from clear local identification of \nthe issue(s) to be addressed to reliance on external change agents \nto identify options for reform, which were picked up by local \npartners. These variations raise questions about how we define \nownership,  particularly  in  fragile  states  with  serious  capacity \nconstraints\u2014 an issue touched on later in this report.\n \nIn the Tonga health management case study, author Kaveinga \nTu\u2019itahi speaks of the ministry staff defining the key directions \nfor  the  project.  He  quotes  one  of  the  senior  managers  in  the \nGovernment  as  follows:  \u201cI  can  say  that  effectively  all  they \n(AusAID)  did  was  ask  us  what  we  needed,  then  they  just \ncoached us along and facilitated our journey in this project.\u201d [ 15 ]\nADB\u2019s Implementation of the Urban Planning and Management \nStrategy (TA No. 3860), 2002\u20132004, in Samoa also underlined \nthe significance of participatory processes and broad stakeholder \nsupport,  including  in  the  TA  design.  Government  agencies \nand  the  TA  steering  committee  actively  participated,  and  the \nGovernment  demonstrated  its  ongoing  commitment.  In  other \ncase  studies,  including  Samson  Rihuoha\u2019s  examination  of \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  Solomon  Islands  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure Development, local leadership in setting directions \nwas less evident (although not totally absent), given the severe \ncapacity constraints the ministry was facing in the aftermath of \nthat country\u2019s ethnic conflict.   \n\n4.  Defining Capacity objectives \n\nAs  suggested  above,  capacity  objectives  were  rarely  defined \nexplicitly  in  the  cases.  In  fact,  in  most  cases,  objectives  were \n\n14 \n\n ADB 2007a. This report contains ADB\u2019s approach to engaging with weakly performing \ncountries. According to the report, ADB has modified its own processes to reflect the realities \non the ground in weakly performing countries.\n\n 16 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n15  Tu\u2019itahi 2007a. p. 8.\n\n\fwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\nwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\fdefined in terms of expected performance improvements, with \nimproved capacity almost an implicit feature of the design. \n\nIt was even rarer for a project to incorporate a \u201dgrand design\u201d \nfor  CD.  When  capacity  objectives  were  spelled  out,  it  was \nusually in relation to specific perceived shortcomings in local \nskills, competencies, or organizational capacities that were seen \nas key to addressing a specific performance deficiency, such as \npoor water and sanitation or health services. There were some \nexceptions, particularly in some of the larger reform programs, \nfor example, the PPII and the Capacity Building Service Centre, \nboth  in  PNG,  where  capacity  objectives  have  been  defined \nmore  explicitly  and  in  more  holistic  terms  than  elsewhere.  In \nthese  cases,  the  project  designers  made  clear  links  between \nindividual competencies, organizational capacity, policies, and \ninstitutional conditions required to support and sustain capacity \nimprovements.  \n\nSome cases focused specifically on higher-level capacity issues, \nsuch as linking different or complementary capacities through \nnetworking, or seeking to create more enabling conditions for \ncapacity utilization via policy reform. Again, these were rarely, \nif at all, described as \u201dcapacity\u201d strategies, or even acknowledged \nas  strategies  that  could  have  a  capacity  benefit,  for  example, \nunleashing capacity, removing binding constraints to capacity, \nor  institutionalizing  incentives  for  more  effective  capacity \nutilization. \n\nThe  experiences  described  above  raise  some  questions  about \nhow capacity and CD are conceived and factored into the design \nof development projects or programs. In some  cases, capacity \nissues were dealt with explicitly, but more often they were not. \nSome of the cases highlight CD as a planned process with inputs \nsequenced in a \u201dbuilding block\u201d approach, whereas in others, the \napproach was emergent, in many respects informal, although at \ntimes informed by reasonably systematic processes of reflection \nand learning. And finally, while some cases embraced a holistic \napproach  to  capacity  issues,  others  focused  on  \u201dpieces  of  the \npuzzle\u201d  that  were  well  (or  less  well)  connected  to  the  larger \nwhole.   \n\nWhile acknowledging that most interventions lacked an explicit \nor detailed capacity strategy, many were actually guided by what \n\n 18 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fmay  be  described  as  a  mental  model  or  view  of  how  change \nwould unfold. This is consistent with the findings from some of \nthe case studies in the European Centre for Development Policy \nManagement  study  on  capacity,  change  and  performance, [ 16 ]\nwhich noted: \n\n\u201c\u2026everybody  in  the  cases,  be  they  analysts  or \npractitioners, who dealt with capacity issues had tacit \nmental  models  or  \u2018frames\u2019  of  change  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  They  subscribed  to  certain  principles \nand  assumptions  about  what  motivated  people \nand  organizations.  They  operated  on  the  basis  of \nassumptions  about  what  caused  what  and  what  led \nto  what.  Or  what  made  people  and  systems  become \neffective.  Or  what  issues  mattered  more  than  others. \nTheir perspectives led to views about where to start a \nprocess of capacity development and what to do and in \nwhat order. Each way of thinking, in practice, reflected \ndifferent theories of change and different perspectives \non human nature.\u201d [ 17 ]\n\nIn some of the cases from the Pacific, the \u201dmental model\u201d was \nclearly based on principles of organizational development. Others, \nas suggested above, drew on aspects of systems thinking, while \nthose seeking to strengthen civil society and local communities \nrelied more on mental models rooted in notions of participation, \nengagement, and empowerment. Donors drew on these various \nmental models in their designs to varying degrees, usually with \nan overlay of bureaucratic planning, emphasizing results-based \nmanagement  and  performance  improvements.  These  diverse \nrealities reinforce a view of CD as a prism-like phenomenon that \nyields different images depending on how you look at it. \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n The European Centre for Development Policy Management study (GOVNET 2005) has been \ncarried out under the aegis of GOVNET, the working group on governance and capacity \ndevelopment of the DAC of the OECD. It includes 18 case studies and various theme papers. \n  Morgan, Baser and Land 2007.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  19\n\n\fB.\n\nImplementation \n\n1.  Different Approaches to Capacity Development\n\nAs the sections above imply, there  are  various ways to frame \na discussion about approaches to CD. For example, one could \ndraw  on  the  different  conceptualizations  of  CD\u2014institutional \neconomics (supply and demand, incentives), drivers of change \n(power),  organizational  development,  systems  or  complexity \ntheory, demand-driven approach, instrumental approach (plan \nand  control),  iterative  or  emergent\u2014as  a  way  of  analyzing  or \ndrawing  out  lessons  about  strategies  or  approaches.  Another \nway of framing the analysis  would  be to focus on the nature \nof the inputs. Appendix 4, for example, outlines a range of CD \nintervention  options,  from  provision  of  advisors  to  training, \ninfrastructure  support,  and  financing  of  programming  for  CD \nprocesses. A third option would be to examine how \u201dcapacity \nstrategies,\u201d explicit or otherwise, played themselves out in the \nvarious cases, in relation to the level of intervention (individual, \norganizational,  sectoral).  The  next  section  provides  a  blended \napproach, looking partly at CD approaches by intervention level, \nwhile also focusing on different mechanisms or strategies that \nwarranted particular attention. \n\na.  enhancing Individual Skills and Competencies \n\nIn  the  early  days  of  development  assistance  in  the  Pacific, \nconsiderable emphasis was placed on development of individual \nskills  and  competencies  through  scholarship  programs,  work \nplacements, study tours, and other means. As noted in one of the \ncase studies: \u201cSamoa has been generously supported for human \nresources development by the New Zealand scholarship scheme, \nwhich has been operating non-stop since it started some sixty \nyears ago, and by the Australian scholarship scheme which is \nnow approaching 30 years\u2019 continuous operation.\u201d [ 18 ]\n\nThe Samoa case goes on to note that human resources development \nhas remained \u201ca core driver for public agency involvement with \naid-funded development schemes,\u201d providing opportunities that \nhave directly benefited individual public servants. \n\n 20 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n18\n\nSolofa 2007b. p. 14.\n\n\fwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\fCommitment  to  human  resources  development  is  reflected  in \nseveral of the cases, with some being more successful than others \nin  ensuring  that  benefits  accrue  not  only  to  the  individuals \ninvolved but their home organization as well.  \n\nThe  case  study,  Revamping  the  Cook  Islands  Public  Sector: \nRightsizing,  Enhancing  Skills  and  Changing  Attitudes [  19  ], \nexamines  attempts  to  enhance  individual  skills  through \ntraining, although within a broader economic and governance \nreform  process.  As  the  title  suggests,  the  case  focuses  on  CD \ninterventions linked to the rightsizing [ 20 ] component of the Cook \nIslands\u2019 economic reform program, which was undertaken in the \n1990s.  The  interventions  included  training  and  skill  upgrades \nto facilitate a shift for individuals either to the reformed public \nsector or the private sector.\n\n The Cook Islands case highlighted some of the opportunities as \nwell as risks of CD programming that focuses on the needs of \nindividuals. On the positive side, it underscored the potential for a \nwell-targeted training program to contribute to a broader reform \nagenda. It did this by focusing on specific skills required under \nthe  public  service  reform  process,  such  as  performance-based \nmanagement, and by engaging a critical mass of mid- to senior-\nlevel  staff  in  a  well-regarded  training  program  (the  executive \ndevelopment program of New Zealand\u2019s Massey University). As \nimportant as the new skills though, was the shift that it effected \nin the \u201dculture of governance\u201d in the Cook Islands administration. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  case  demonstrated  how  the  benefits  of \nsuch programs risk fading over time as \u201dreform fatigue\u201d sets in, \nkey leaders move on, and the conditions that drove the initial \nreforms slip down the government agenda\u2014in other words, the \nchallenge of sustaining the capacity transformation. \n\nThe case also raised questions about the extent to which the human \nresource focus should have been on individual competencies or \nstrengthening  local  institutional  capacity  to  provide  relevant \ntraining to Cook Islanders on an ongoing basis. As noted in the \ncase,  while  the  initial  focus  was  on  key  individuals  from  the \nCook Islands Government, there was recognition over time of the \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n Wichman, 2007b.

This was done \neventually through an arrangement with the University of the \nSouth Pacific.  \n\nThe case study on legal sector reform process in Vanuatu also \nhad a strong, although not exclusive, focus on individual skills \nrequired  within  the  sector  to  support  a  broader  sector  reform \nprocess. Once again, the case underlined some of the advantages \nof situating human resource efforts in a broader reform process, \nbut also showed how capacity gains can be limited by institutional \nconstraints, including difficulties, in Vanuatu\u2019s case, in retaining \nprofessional staff. \n\nBox 1: Does training work?\n\nMark Nelson of the World Bank Institute explores this question \nin a 2006 Capacity Development Brief, which examines donor-\nsponsored training programs. As Nelsons notes, \u201cthe dominant \nfinding of most evaluations of training in a development context \nis that it has proved less effective than expected. Donors have \noften supported training programs as a way of addressing a variety \nof institutional, organizational, and individual skills weaknesses \nthat  they  assume  training  of  key  individuals  can  correct  or \nimprove. These expectations are seldom met.\u201d However, not all \nis bleak. As Nelson declares, \u201cprograms can be effective when \ndone under favourable conditions and when country demand, \nmotivation, and ownership are high.\u201d He concludes with a number \nof recommendations for improving training outcomes, urging that \ntraining should be\n \n\n \u0083\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\ndesigned and financed by the employer; \nfocused on specific organizational outputs and \noutcomes;\ntake place in a results-based organizational \nenvironment; and\noperate within a favorable institutional, legal, \neconomic, and political environment with \ndemonstrable demand. \n\nSource: Nelson, Mark. 2006.

[ 21 ] This issue is discussed in subsequent \nsections. \n\nA  related  issue  in  several  cases  was  the  appropriateness  of \ntraining  in  the  given  context.  In  some  instances,  the  focus \nwas ensuring that training materials were relevant to the local \ncontext. The Cook Islands case offered a positive example; case \nstudy material for the program with Massey University was based \non local experiences identified by Cook Islands participants. In \nother cases, the focus was the relationship between the level of \nthe training materials and the capabilities or knowledge base of \nparticipants.  The  latter  was  noted  in  several  cases  of  training \nprovided  for  local  leaders.  As  a  local  consultant  cautioned  in \nthe Tuvalu Trust Fund case: \u201cinternational agencies need to step \nback from international best practice and pitch advice at a level \nappropriate to the recipients.\u201d [ 22 ]\n\nb.  Strategies for effective use of existing Capacity\n\nRather than relying on training, some cases revealed strategies \naimed at unlocking or making better use of existing capacity, \nusually  relying  on  human  resource  management  tools  and \nstrategies.  As  with  the  training  examples  above,  these  cases \nhighlighted the possibilities as well as the limitations of addressing \ncapacity constraints or leakage through such means. \n\nPay reform was one option employed in several cases to try to \nensure staff would not leave government for \u201dgreener pastures,\u201d \nincluding staff who had already been trained through government \nand/or donor-funded programs. This strategy worked to varying \ndegrees, depending on the specific incentives the government was \nable to offer and how they compared to opportunities outside the \npublic sector. In some cases, there seemed to be an expectation \nthat loss of public servants was all but inevitable, and that those \nwho  left  would  simply  be  replaced  by  the  next  generation  of \ngraduates, who would gain quality, entry-level work experience \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n The United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development publication (DFID 2006), \nHow to Provide Technical Cooperation Personnel, distinguishes between initiatives that are \ntransactional in nature, e.g., \u201cto help a state or private sector organisation to establish new \nsystems and technology, and deliver specific outputs\u201d and others that are \u201cmore ambitious \nand transformational \u2013 to support the organisation\u2019s sustainable capacity to deliver its main \noutputs in the future.\u201d\n  Bell 2007. p. 12.\n\n 24 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fthat  would,  in  turn,  be  followed  by  their  departure  from  the \npublic service. \n\nIn the Tongan health management case, the author described how \nthe project harnessed the ministry\u2019s capacity through effective \nuse of workshops, on-site discussions, interactive meetings, and \nuse of committees and working groups with staff from relevant \nareas. This was referred to as \u201ddeveloping Tongan solutions to \nTongan problems\u201d [ 23 ] and was seen as one means of trying to \nmotivate and make better use of existing staff.\n\nOther  cases,  described  further  below,  displayed  how  a  strong \nsense  of  ownership  or  commitment  to  a  cause  (for  example, \nimproved  water  and  sanitation)  among  local  stakeholders,  or \nthe creation of a more positive work environment by employers, \ncreated better conditions to retain and use local capacity.  \n\nThe  few  examples  described  above,  along  with  the  training \ncases, illustrate two important points. First is that training and \nstrategies to make better use of existing capacity, such as pay \nreform, are necessary but usually insufficient by themselves to \naddress  broader  capacity  challenges.  Second,  the  experiences \nunderline  how  institutional  disincentives  and  weaknesses  in \nhuman resource planning and management capacity\u2014including \nhow to assess needs, use TA effectively, and link human resource \ninterventions to broader reform processes\u2014can further limit the \ncontribution of training or human resource reforms to sustainable \ncapacity changes.   \n\nc.  gap Filling \n\nAbsolute gaps in specific capacity areas are an ongoing challenge \nfor some Pacific island countries, given weaknesses in education \nsystems and sometimes mobile populations, such as in the Cook \nIslands  and  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands.  These  countries \nare vulnerable, in capacity terms, quite often in areas of high \nstrategic importance, such as trade negotiations, anticorruption \nand  money  laundering,  and  telecommunications.  In  these \ncircumstances, evidence suggests that \u201dtraditional\u201d CD strategies, \nsuch as training public servants, may not be the optimal strategy, \nor may need to be combined with other approaches.  \n\n23 \n\n See Tonga Health Sector Planning & Management Project - Phase II - Project Design Document \n- AusAID & Government of Tonga, March 2001. p. 9.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  25\n\n\fRather than allowing these gaps to shut down a whole system, \ngap filling is often used to ensure continuity in the system. A \n2005 review of the Commonwealth Secretariat\u2019s Strategic Gap \nFilling Program [ 24 ] noted the different approaches\u2014each of which \nwas  seen  as  having  merit  in  light  of  the  prevailing  capacity \nsituation\u2014taken by long-term advisors under that program. They \nincluded \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\noperational  gap  filling  (sometimes  with  secondary \nresponsibilities  for  skills  transfer  or  systems \ndevelopment);\nassuming an advisory role (e.g., on strategic policy or \nprogramming priorities); and\nmentoring and/or skills transfer role (time limited from \na centralized or regional base), including \u201cin and out\u201d \nmentoring. \n\nGap  filling  in  this  sense  is  different  from  the  often  criticized \nscenario where expatriates assume roles that could otherwise be \nfilled by national actors. Nevertheless, gap filling is still criticized \nfor not responding sufficiently to long-term capacity needs or \ndoing enough to break cycles of dependency on external expertise. \nThe Commonwealth Secretariat review found that the gap-filling \nassignments were not always clear on counterpart arrangements, \nor where they belonged in broader capacity-building strategies. \nHowever, the report also found that if properly designed, gap-\nfilling TA can contribute to CD, particularly if it is tailored to the \nparticular needs of the beneficiary country. And by responding \nto strategic priorities at key junctures, it can reduce a country\u2019s \nvulnerability  and  provide  a  stronger  base  for  use  of  existing \ncapacity in the country. [ 25 ]\n\nThe  need  for  ongoing  gap  filling  in  the  Pacific  reflects  the \nreality that many countries in the region are not able to either \ndevelop  or  retain  the  skills  they  require,  the  net  result  being \nthat they either have to buy the skills on international markets, \n\n24 \n\n The review was undertaken by the European Centre for Development Policy Management and \nincluded a review of the Commonwealth Secretariat\u2019s program in the Pacific.\n\n25   Examples of this include a \u201dgap-filling\u201d trade policy adviser enhancing the potential for small \nto medium-size entrepreneurs to function effectively under a new trade regime, or advisors \nto national law offices increasing the capacity of local officers to address money laundering \nissues. \n\n 26 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\frely on technical assistance provided by donor agencies, or do \nwithout. Gap filling, as a phenomenon, also reflects increasing \nglobalization,  with  skills  being  transferred  regularly  across \ninternational borders. In that sense, all countries, industrialized \nor other, engage in gap filling. \n\nThe term gap filling was not used in any of the cases covered in \nthis study. However, some of the TA interventions were consistent \nwith  the  description  above.  For  example,  as  detailed  further \nbelow, the advisor to the ADB-sponsored Republic of Marshall \nIslands (RMI) fisheries project became involved in marketing of \nRMI as a destination for investment on behalf of the Government \nand took part in negotiations on the Government\u2019s behalf. These \nactivities were beyond his terms of reference but reflected the \nacknowledged and strategically important weaknesses in the RMI \nGovernment. This \u201dgap filling\u201d provided an opportunity for the \nGovernment to address issues that would lead to more effective \nuse of capacity in the country\u2019s private sector. In the Solomon \nIslands infrastructure development case, the consultants provided \ntraining and advisory support, but also took an active role in \nimplementation, partly due to capacity gaps in the ministry in \nthe  aftermath  of  the  recent  conflict.  The  implications  of  this \napproach in a post-conflict scenario, such as Solomon Islands, \nare discussed further below. [ 26 ]\n\nd.  Supporting organizational Capacity Development\n\nThe  Tonga  health  management case  is  an  example  of  a  TA \nproject focused primarily on organizational-level capacity issues, \nspecifically in the country\u2019s Ministry of Health (MoH). The case \nstudy  describes  how  pressures  on  the  health  care  system  had \nintensified over years leading to the determination that the \u201dcore \nproblem\u201d was a need for improved planning, management, and \ncoordination in the MoH. It was anticipated that the proposed \nchanges  would  strengthen  the  ministry\u2019s  planning,  human \nresource  management,  training,  and  communications,  as  well \nas work practices, procedures, performance measurement, and \nmonitoring. The last mentioned, in turn, would help to identify \nsolutions to difficulties faced in specific areas, such as medical \nrecords  and  procedures  for  patient  admission,  transfer,  and \ndischarge. \n\n26 For more on gap filling and other approaches to TA, see Land 2007.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  27\n\n\fThe  project  had  three  phases.  The  first  involved  intensive \ndiagnosis of capacity issues in MoH and assessment of MoH\u2019s \nabsorptive capacity for changes proposed for the next phase. The \nsecond phase built on activities from the first phase, extending \nthem  to  the  division  and  section  levels,  and  the  third  phase \nfocused on consolidation of achievements and development of \na model that other government agencies could use. \n\nAccording  to  the  case  study  author,  Kaveinga  Tu\u2019itahi,  the \npositive achievements could be attributed, in large measure, to \nthe management team and the conditions they provided for the \nchange process. The case speaks to \u201ctheir vigilance in addressing \nthe various challenges and taking a clear visionary and focused \nstrategic approach to the tasks they face.\u201d [ 27 ] Much of the credit \nwas  given  to  the  minister  who  was  described  as  \u201cyoung  and \nopen to meaningful change\u201d and who put \u201cthe full weight of his \noffice\u201d behind the initiative. The importance of leadership, vision, \nand  senior-level  support  to  organizational  change  processes, \nincluding efforts to address capacity issues, is a theme that also \nemerged in other cases and is addressed further in the section \non key success factors. \n\nThe aforementioned Solomon Islands case study on Reconstruction \nof a Fragile State examines efforts to reestablish the capacity \nof  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  after  the \nethnic conflict in that country. Once the country was secure, the \nGovernment drew up a medium-term development strategy to \ncontribute to the stabilization and restoration of the economy. The \nplan\u2019s fifth key strategic area was revitalization of the productive \nsector and rebuilding of supporting infrastructure. However, as \nthe case notes, \u201cMID officials believed that before SI\u2019s [Solomon \nIslands\u2019] medium and long term reconstruction issues could be \naddressed effectively, MID\u2019s internal capacity would have to be \nstrengthened.\u201d [ 28 ]  This  led  to  a  request  to  the  ADB  for  TA  to \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  MID  to  plan,  manage,  and  finance \ninfrastructure development \u201cin a sustainable manner.\u201d Besides \ntraining professional staff, the TA helped the Government prepare \na national transport plan, and establish a transport policy and \nplanning unit, as well as a national transport fund.\n\n27 \n28 \n\n Tu\u2019itahi 2007a. p. 4.\n Rihuoha 2007. p. 4.\n\n 28 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fThe Solomon Islands initiative was seen as a success in terms of \nmeeting its expected deliverables, but this could be attributed, at \nleast in part, to the significant role played by the advisors, such \nas  in  developing  the  plans  and  designing  new  organizational \nstructures. However, the case also shows the challenges of taking \non a complex organizational CD initiative in the early recovery \nstage following a conflict. An evaluation of the project noted \nthat  while  skills  were  effectively  transferred  in  such  areas  as \nproject management, the project was less successful in sustaining \nskills in areas where local staff had limited prior experience. The \nevaluation went on to state that \u201cNo evidence can be found that \nany training, either formal or on the job training, was provided \nin the creation of new  institutional structures and procedures \nwithin  MID\u201d [ 29 ]\u2014something  which  would  seem  to  be  key  to \nsustainability.\n\nSome  of  the  perceived  shortcomings  in  the  Solomon  Islands \nproject  were  attributed  to  an  inaccurate  assessment  of  MID\u2019s \ncapacity  (including  its  ability  to  absorb  training)  and  lack  of \ntime  provided  for  follow-up  support.  The  evaluation  also \nnoted that the many vacant positions in the ministry after the \nconflict affected efforts to improve MID\u2019s internal capacity, as \ndid the Government\u2019s slowness in recruiting new staff due to a \nrecruitment freeze. \n\nIn brief, the two cases described above highlight the importance \nof leadership, senior-level support, and enabling conditions to \neffective organizational change. The Solomon Islands case, in \nparticular, also shows the need to assess capacity accurately in \nadvance  and  to  calibrate  expectations  accordingly,  especially \nwhen  dealing  with  post-conflict  situations.  These  themes  and \nthe  Solomon  Islands  case  are  discussed  further  in  subsequent \nsections.\n\ne.  enhancing Capacity for Sector Reforms\n\nSector  reforms  lend  themselves  to  a  systems  approach  to  CD, \ngiven  the  need  for  coordination  and  collaboration  across \ngovernment  systems,  and  with  nongovernment  actors.  This \nwas the case in the AusAID-funded legal sector strengthening \n\n29 ADB 2006b. p. 13.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  29\n\n\fprogram in Vanuatu, which tackled issues in the legal sector\u2014\nstaff development, relationship building, administrative reform, \nreview  of  existing  laws  and  structures,  and  improvements  in \naccommodation for justice sector offices. The program was also \naligned  with  Vanuatu\u2019s  ADB-financed  comprehensive  reform \nprogram, which included a broader reform agenda covering such \nareas  as  governance,  public  sector  reform,  and  private  sector \ndevelopment. \n\nSector reforms, such as sector-wide approaches and CD processes, \nare expected to reinforce or build on host country ownership, \nworking  through  local  institutional  structures.  However,  the \nexperience with the Vanuatu legal sector strengthening program \nand  other  sector  reforms  also  demonstrates  how  they  can  be \n\u201dcapacity-demanding\u201d because of the need for the lead ministry to \nadvance policy and institutional reforms, enhance collaboration \nwith domestic partners, and harmonize with external actors\u2014all \nareas requiring significant capacity that is often in short supply. \nThe ability of the lead ministry to advance reforms can also be \ncompromised  by  factors  in  other  parts  of  the  system,  such  as \nremuneration packages for lawyers in the case of legal sector \nstrengthening, which were not seen as competitive enough to \nsustain legal careers in Vanuatu\u2019s public sector. \n\nIn both RMI case studies (fisheries and youth services), author \nBen Graham noted how ADB collaborated with the Government \nto  address  capacity  issues.  The  key  stakeholders  recognized \nthe  need  to  address  a  spectrum  of  issues  in  an  integrated \nmanner\u2014simultaneously  or  sequentially\u2014in  order  to  realize \nthe expected objectives. In the RMI fisheries case, there was an \nexplicit  recognition  of  the  need  to  deal  with  both  policy  and \norganizational issues in the sector, reported as \u201ca rethinking of \nfisheries development\u201d that could only be supported by a broad-\nbased, multiyear reform program to deal with the fisheries sector \nas a whole system.\n     \nThe youth project, while not strictly a sector reform program, had \ntwo streams, one of which focused on developing the enabling \nenvironment (policies, strengthening the responsible ministry as \nwell as nonstate actors, and enhancing collaboration among the \ndiverse  actors  involved).  The  other  focused  on  \u201dDevelopment \nof  Youth,\u201d  addressing  issues  from  improved  school  retention \nrates  to  enhanced  service  delivery  capacity  and  engagement \n\n 30 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fof youth in civic affairs. Similar to the Vanuatu case, a lesson \narising was that while a broad approach to problem analysis and \nintervention design is appropriate, it does not necessarily lead \nto the expected results at the broader systems level, particularly \nif a binding constraint intervenes, such as a capacity gap, a lack \nof commitment, poor relationships among relevant stakeholders, \na  disabling  policy  environment,  or  any  combination  of  such \nfactors.\n\nThe  difficulties  described  briefly  above  reflect  the  inherent \nchallenges  in  reforms  that  involve  diverse  stakeholders  in  an \nextended capacity system. They point to the need to invest in \nunderstanding the \u201dsystem,\u201d to identify strategic entry points [ 30 ]\nand appropriate sequencing of inputs, and the need for flexibility \nand capacity to adjust to changing contextual realities\u2014in other \nwords,  a  clear  strategy  for  CD,  including  how  such  inputs  as \nTA are used to support it. Providing sufficient time is another \nimportant consideration for sector reforms, discussed further in \nthe section on key success factors.  \n\nf.  Policy and Institutional Reform \n\nSome case studies had an explicit focus on policy or institutional \nreforms, usually as part of a broader reform process. The Vanuatu \nlegal  sector  reforms  discussed  above,  for  example,  involved \nsupport  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key  sector  institutions \nand to review existing laws to identify priorities for legislative \naction. The latter led to drafting, amending, or passage of key \nlegislation, such as the legal profession bill, criminal procedure \ncode, and penal code. \n\nIn the Kiribati case study on water and sanitation, there was a \nrecognized need to deal with several issues\u2014community health, \neducation,  water  supply,  sanitation,  appropriate  technology, \ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  management  aspects\u2014in  a \ncoordinated approach, including  the development of \u201csuitable \nstrategies and policies for addressing the issues.\u201d [ 31 ]\n\nBoth RMI cases also recognized the need to update or develop new \npolicies to provide an enabling environment for planned reforms. \n\n30 \n31 \n\n For example, the RMI youth services case referred to \u201cfollowing the energy\u201d in the system.\n Mackenzie 2007. p. 2.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  31\n\n\fwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\fIn the youth services case, this was combined with interventions \nto  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs \n(including  the  Youth  Bureau)  and  the  Marshall  Islands  Youth \nCongress, and to increase cross-sector collaboration. \n\nIn  none  of  the  cases  was  support  for  policy  and  institutional \nreform  described  specifically  as  a  \u201dcapacity  development\u201d \ninitiative, although in some cases external advisors worked with \nPacific islanders to strengthen policy development skills, usually \nin a learning-by-doing mode. Nevertheless, the experiences point \nto the potential for relying on policy and institutional reform as \na  \u201dcapacity  strategy\u201d  that  can  provide  space  for  effective  use \nof  capacity  in  the  local  or  national  context,  for  example,  by \nremoving such constraints as disabling policies, or by reforming \ninstitutions that might otherwise limit reform processes. \n \ng.  Strengthening Interorganizational Collaboration \n\nThe  AusAID-funded  Provincial  Performance  Improvement \nInitiative (PPII) is a PNG Government initiative (started in 2004) \nled  by  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government \nAffairs  (DPLGA)  in  partnership  with  Department  of  National \nPlanning and Monitoring. For AusAID, support to PPII represents \npart of their subnational strategy. The objective of the initiative \nis to improve public administration at the subnational level, but \nit also includes support for national initiatives that affect lower \nlevels  of  government,  such  as  intergovernmental  financing, \nlegal  structures,  coordination  with  provinces,  and  local \ngovernments. \n\nGiven the nature of the intended reforms, there is a real need to \nstrengthen capacity for interorganizational collaboration at the \nprovincial level, but also in terms of federal-provincial relations. \nIn  fact,  one  of  the  objectives  during  the  pilot  phases  was  to \n\u201cStrengthen  national  agency  linkages  with  provincial/district/\nLocal Level Government administrations.\u201d This has led to specific \ninterventions linking national agencies to the provinces working \non service improvement, including consultative forums. AusAID \nsupports this process, in part, by \u201dco-locating\u201d Australia-based \nand locally engaged AusAID staff in key national government \ndepartments and provincial administrations. \n\nThe PPII is still underway at the time of writing and is likely to \nyield interesting lessons over time, including how to engender \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  33\n\n\for  strengthen  capacity  to  collaborate\u2014a  particular  challenge \nin a context like PNG, with its significant capacity constraints \n(especially  at  the  decentralized  level),  where  the  approach  to \ndecentralization  remains  controversial  and  where  incentives \nhave not always favored collaboration. \n\nIn the RMI youth services case, as noted above, project stakeholders \nrecognized the need  for  interorganizational  collaboration, but \nalso  saw  weaknesses  in  government  capacity  as  a  potential \nobstacle. A decision was made to designate the National Training \nCouncil (NTC) as lead agency for the reforms. This required an \noverhaul of NTC, including updating legislation, formulating a \nnew strategic plan, hiring a new director, identifying new board \nmembers, and providing organizational strengthening  support \nfrom  ADB.  This  was  done  with  an  understanding  that  NTC \nwould continue to operate under the direction of the Ministry \nof Internal Affairs. However, as the case revealed, the Ministry \nof Internal Affairs was not up to the challenge given leadership, \nhuman resource, and other capacity shortcomings. A conclusion \nfrom  the  case  study  was  that  some  of  the  recommendations \nfrom the ADB TA were unlikely to ever be implemented given \nvarious constraints, including the challenge of coordinating the \nagencies required to support improvement of youth services in \nthe country.  \n\nThe  Tonga  health  management  case  offers  a  somewhat  more \noptimistic  example  of  interorganizational  collaboration. \nThe  Tongan  Ministry  of  Health  secured  the  support  of  other \nagencies in government, including Ministry of Finance, Central \nPlanning Department, and other key public service agencies, to \nadvance their reforms. Collaboration also relied on policy and \nexecutive committees, as well as human resource training and \ndevelopment committees. As the case study noted, \u201cThis ensured \na wider network for mutual support and essential and effective \nnetworking.\u201d The other Tongan case study, which examined an \nADB TA aimed at enhanced integrated strategic planning, offered \na similar picture; it brought \u201cthe strategic planning process in \nharmony  with  fiscal  planning  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance,\u201d [ 32 ]\nby  enhancing  collaboration  between  the  Central  Planning \nDepartment and the Ministry of Finance. \n\n 34 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n32 Tu\u2019itahi 2007b. p. 5. \n\n\fh.  Regional Strategies for Capacity Development\n\nThe  vision  statement  in  the  Pacific  regional  plan  recognizes \nthe \u201climited capacity and fragile and vulnerable environment\u201d \nof  the  region\u2019s  small  island  states,  leading  to  a  call  for  more \n\u201cregional  approaches  to  overcoming  capacity  limitations  in \nservice  delivery  at  a  national  level,  and  increasing  economic \nopportunities through market integration.\u201d [ 33 ] Toward that end, \none  of  the  strategic  objectives  of  the  plan  is  \u201cthe  building  of \nstrong partnerships with national and regional stakeholders\u2026. \n(including)  regional  volunteer  schemes  and  other  forms  of \nregional exchanges for capacity building.\u201d \n\nOne case study, The Role of USPNet in Capacity Development in \nthe  South  Pacific  Region [ 34 ], was chosen specifically to garner \ninsights on the role of regional institutions in CD in the Pacific. \nAs  authors  Ron  Duncan  and  James  McMaster  note,  the  case \nstudy \u201ctells the complex story of how a regional university has \nchanged its delivery systems for teaching and learning to serve \nthe growing needs for tertiary education of students living on \nthousands of small islands in the Pacific Ocean (including) the \ndevelopment and use of its communications technology system \ncalled USPNet.\u201d [ 35 ]\n\nThe  University  of  the  South  Pacific  (USP)  distance  education \nprogram in the region started in 1970, focusing mainly on in-\nservice teachers. By 1976, USP had a total of 90 distance education \nstudents enrolled in 16 courses through four university centers \nand  four  education  departments.  By  2006,  there  were  more \nthan 10,000 distance education students (almost half of USP\u2019s \ntotal student population) enrolled in over 200 courses. Initially, \nUSPNet only had voice capacity, but with recent upgrades now \noffers instruction using a multimedia format that has increased \nthe quality of the educational experience for students and helped \nreduce attrition rates. \nThe case study describes how USPNet has contributed to capacity \nat  various  levels  in  the  region:  at  USP  headquarters,  through \n\n33  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2006. The Pacific Plan includes 21 references to the word \n\ncapacity, showing its importance. \n\n34  Duncan, Ron, and James McMaster. 2007.

The case also \nsuggests that USPNet still has considerable untapped potential \nto contribute to strengthening capacity in the public and private \nsector, and to civil society in the region.\n\nFrom a CD perspective, the case offers interesting insights on \nboth the opportunities and challenges associated with relying on \nregional institutions to address capacity issues. To begin with, \nit reflects what would appear to be an increasing interest in the \nPacific, and elsewhere, in regional or \u201dnetwork-like\u201d responses \nto capacity challenges. Such responses include the South Pacific \nForum,  South  Pacific  Regional  Environmental  Programme, \nand Forum Fisheries Agency. As suggested in the development \nliterature, [ 36 ] networks, coalitions, and other types of partnership \narrangements  are  increasingly  being  relied  on  to  respond  to \nsuch complex issues as environmental management, economic \ncooperation, and HIV/AIDS. They also reflect a desire to bring \ncapacity together to respond more efficiently and effectively to \nrapidly  changing  conditions,  something  that  has  been  greatly \nhelped  by  advances  in  information  and  communications \ntechnology, including reduced costs. \nThe  USPNet  case  draws  attention  to  some  of  the  capacities \nor  capabilities  required  to  make  networks  work  effectively: \nleadership  (more  \u201ddistributed\u201d  than  in  other  organizational \nforms); legitimacy and collective identity; technical capacity; and \ncapacity to manage or serve the network, including facilitating \nparticipatory  approaches,  knowledge  management,  and \nadaptability. It also shows the potential for relying on regional \nmechanisms, knowledge networks, communities of practice, and \nprofessional associations as networks of, or facilitators of, CD. \nThis type of collaborative capacity is particularly important in \nPacific island countries given their weak (or nonexistent) local \ninstitutions, limited skills base, and often mobile populations. \n\n 36 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n36\n\nSee, for example, Taschereau and Bolger 2007. \n\n\fi. \n\nenhancing Domestic Capacity to Develop Capacity\n\nThe  research  team  selected  several  cases  intended  to  bring  to \nthe fore issues relating to the use of TA facilities. One of these, \nSamoa\u2019s Public Sector Improvement Facility, has been completed, \nbut the others (Advisory Support Facility and Capacity Building \nService Centre, both in PNG) had to be put aside as the consultant \nidentified was not able to undertake the work. Nevertheless, some \ncomments are offered below on the two PNG initiatives based on \nreview of relevant material. Examining experiences in the region \nwith TA facilities was seen as important for several reasons: (i) \nTA remains at the core of much CD work in the Pacific; (ii) the \nuse and management of TA, particularly in pursuit of sustainable \ncapacity,  continues  to  be  controversial;  and  (iii)  TA  facilities \nrepresent an alternative approach to TA, with increased emphasis \non  local  management  and  control  of  TA,  including  ensuring \nresponsiveness to domestic priorities.  \n\nAccording to the AusAID design document, the Samoa Public \nSector Improvement Facility was based on a desire to \u201cdesign \na  facility  appropriate  to  Samoa\u2019s  social  and  cultural  context, \nenvironment and economy that will support the Government of \nSamoa to build the capacity of its public service to implement \nits national development priorities. (It will) \u2026. address priority \nsmall-scale needs in support of economic and public sector reform \nwithin the key GoS public sector agencies.\u201d [ 37 ] The mechanism \nis  managed  by  a  facility  management  unit  in  the  Ministry  of \nthe  Prime  Minister  and  is  supported  by  a  contracted  support \nteam.  An  overarching  strategy  is  to  strengthen  cooperation \namong public sector agencies involved in public sector reform \nand  between  those  actors  and  civil  society  and  private  sector \ninterests. The facility has been operating for several years. Like \nPNG\u2019s Capacity Building Service Centre (CBSC), discussed below, \nthe start-up years are seen as a transition period that will involve \nenhancing the capacity of the government team to assume full \nmanagement responsibility for the facility over time. \n\nThe experience to date with the Samoan facility highlights some \nof  the  challenges  associated  with  establishing  such  a  locally-\nmanaged  mechanism.  As  the  case  study  notes,  \u201cthe  story  of \nthe  Facility  so  far  is  entirely  about  building  (practically  from \n\n37 AusAID 2004c. p. iv.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  37\n\n\fscratch) the capacity of the Samoa government to manage the \nFacility.\u201d [ 38 ]  Part  of  this  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the \nfacility is only a few years old. However, the author provides \nother reasons: incorrect assumptions about the capacity of the \nGovernment to run such a facility, lack of skilled and innovative \nleaders and an organizational culture amenable to supporting \nsuch  a  facility,  and  emigration,  which  has  drawn  away  some \nof Samoa\u2019s best and brightest to overseas destinations, such as \nAustralia and New Zealand. \n \nThe  CBSC  in  PNG\u2019s  health  sector  was  established  in  2005  to \n\u201cimprove the health of all Papua New Guineans by developing \ncompetencies and capabilities of individual, organizations and \nsystems in the PNG health sector.\u201d [ 39 ] It represents a relatively new \nmodality for AusAID: the partnering approach. This  approach \nentails joint participation by the Government, AusAID, and the \nCBSC  contractor  in  a  charter  board  and  management  group \nintended  to  allow  the  three  parties  to  share  responsibility  for \nthe direction and performance of the center, while providing the \nflexibility to adjust its operations to address emerging needs.\n\nThe  CBSC  takes  a  fairly  comprehensive  approach  to  capacity \nissues in PNG\u2019s health system, addressing sector-specific needs \n(technical  and  managerial)  at  various  levels  and  governance \nand  administrative  arrangements  affecting  the  sector,  while \nsupporting learning about CD innovations. It has also invested in \nprofessionalizing the procedures for recruitment and selection of \nTA personnel, as well as performance measurement of advisors. \nThe establishment of the CBSC itself is also noteworthy, like the \nSamoa facility, as a donor-funded mechanism, supported by a \ncontracting agency that, over the longer-term, is intended to be \nintegrated into the national government. \n\nAs of 2007, the PNG Advisory Support Facility (ASF) had over 50 \nadvisors working in 22 government departments and agencies or \nsupporting specific initiatives in the country, including the Public \nSector Workforce Development Initiative (PSWDI), Department \nof Provincial and Local Government Affairs, National Economic \nFiscal  Commission,  National  AIDS  Council,  and  Treasury \nDepartment. One difference between the CBSC and ASF is that \n\n38  Solofa 2007a. p. 13.\n39  Statement taken from Capacity Building Service Centre Charter between AusAID, Papua New \n\nGuinea Government, and the Australian managing contractor. \n\n 38 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fASF is more of a \u201dfree standing\u201d facility that responds to demand \nin many government departments and agencies rather than being \ndedicated or limited to a specific sector. A mid-term review of \nthe ASF noted the following key success factors: \n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\nactive, involved board of management;\na  strategic  plan  linked  to  government  priorities  for \npublic sector reform;\nprofessional recruitment and government selection of \nadvisors;\ncomprehensive induction and ongoing support; and\nincentives  for  quality  of  advice  provided  versus \noutputs. \n\nThe  facilities  described  above  are  attempts  to  address  the \nimportant issue of TA management, and use of TA for effective \nCD, with local stakeholders in the driver\u2019s seat, from identification \nof need to recruitment, selection, and assessment of performance. \nWhile these facilities show promise\u2014including ensuring greater \nflexibility, responsiveness, and ownership\u2014they also have their \nown  capacity  issues,  as  the  Samoa  case  highlights.  Questions \nworthy of further exploration as these facilities progress include \nhow effective they have actually been in localizing management \nof TA, reducing dependency on external advisors, and increasing \nthe overall quality of CD processes. \n\nOther issues that merit further exploration include the different \ngovernance and/or management arrangements and approaches \nused  by  the  facilities,  the  effectiveness  of  the  \u201dcounterpart \nsystem,\u201d  incentives  for  various  stakeholders,  and  how  impact \non  the  host  agency\u2019s  capacity  is  measured.    Finally,  it  will \nbe  important  to  learn  more  about  how  \u201ddemand\u201d  for  TA  and \nCD  support  is  managed,  how  requests  from  local  partners  are \nreconciled with sector priorities, and how capacity is used for \nsustainable  benefit. [  40  ]  Positive  findings  on  these  and  other \nconsiderations  would  improve  the  prospects  for  increasing \nreliance on such facilities for addressing capacity issues in other \nsettings.  \n\n40  For example, it would be worthwhile to establish a clearer sense of the so-called \u201dfree good\u201d \nsyndrome and whether facilities encourage more critical consideration of the costs and benefits \nof different technical assistance options.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  39\n\n\fVillage meeting at Serki, South Fly (Source: Ok Tedi Mine CMCA Review - www.wanbelistap.com)\n\n\fj. \n\nVoice, empowerment, and Accountability \n\nPNG\u2019s law and justice sector program (LJSP) supports the country\u2019s \nnational strategy for  law and justice. The overall objective of \nthis AusAID-funded program is to increase the responsiveness \nof the justice system to community needs, including improved \ndelivery of legal and judicial services and law enforcement. Key \nprinciples underlying the program are working through national \nsystems  to  ensure  PNG  ownership;  building  linkages  between \nthe informal and formal systems of justice; acknowledging the \nstrong social and cultural context of law and justice in PNG; and \nworking with communities to resolve disputes and achieve good \norder, peace, and harmony. [ 41 ] \n\nThe  case  study  on  this  program  focuses  on  the  community \njustice  liaison  unit  (CJLU),  which  was  established  under  LJSP \nto enhance the capacity of PNG civil society and to facilitate its \ninvolvement in policy development and delivery of services in \nthe justice sector. The CJLU emerged from consultations in 2003 \non how to engage civil society and community representatives \nmore effectively in sector planning and implementation. It now \nhas a mandate to facilitate partnerships between formal law and \njustice agencies and civil society.

The case is also noteworthy \n\n41 McQueen (undated).\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  41\n\n\ffor demonstrating the potential for external agents to tap into \nand  support  traditional  institutions\u2014such  as  PNG  approaches \nto mediation and restorative justice\u2014 while encouraging links \nbetween the formal and informal aspects of the justice system. \nNevertheless,  PNG  stakeholders  acknowledge  that  challenges \nremain, including how to institutionalize the capacity that has \nbeen built up in PNG civil society in a manner that will allow \ncivil  society  actors  to  continue  to  deliver  services  and  hold \ngovernment accountable on justice sector issues. An associated, \npractical challenge will be how to diminish reliance over time \non donor funding and government support. \n\nThe Nauru case study, Nauru National Sustainable Development \nStrategy: Building Capacity through Participation [ 42 ], examines \na  joint  effort  of  the  Government,  ADB,  AusAID,  and  Pacific \nIslands  Forum  Secretariat.  The  project,  which  took  place  in \n2005, assisted the Government and people of Nauru to determine \nand  prioritize  long-term  development  options.  While  the  key \noutcome of the project was to be a new development plan and \nimplementation  strategy,  the  project  team  saw  the  process  as \nan  opportunity  to  develop  domestic  capacity,  consistent  with \nthe OECD\u2019s statement that a national sustainable development \nstrategy  is  \u201ca  strategic  and  participatory  process  of  analysis, \ndebate,  capacity  strengthening,  planning  and  action  towards \nsustainable development.\u201d [ 43 ]\n\nAs the author of the Nauru case noted: \n\n\u201cThe participatory planning approaches had particular \npower  in  building  capacity  because  they  presumed \nevery  citizen\u2019s  experience  has  \u2018gold\u2019  to  offer  and \nsought  to  actively  \u2018mine\u2019,  process  and  celebrate  this \nresource.  Because  people\u2019s  experience  and  thinking \nwas  recognized  and  valued,  they  are  more  likely  to \nfeel a sense of engagement and ownership.

In several cases described above, \ninterventions helped to strengthen capacity of local stakeholders \nto advocate or support reforms. However, in some instances this \nwas not matched by capacity or commitment on the supply side \nto respond with equal force. From a programming perspective, \nthis raises questions about how to ensure a reasonable balance \nbetween supply and demand, or how interventions encouraging \nboth  can  be  synchronized  or  sequenced  most  effectively.  The \ncases also raise the question of demand from whom\u2014demand in \nsome cases came primarily from local leaders or elites, while in \nothers it clearly emerged from the community. Each of these is \nlikely to have different consequences in terms of the \u201dlegitimacy\u201d \nof the demands and how, or if, support for them will be sustained. \nIt also raises questions about whose capacity for enhanced voice \nor demand is being developed.\n\nk.  Financing Mechanisms for Capacity \nStrengthening and utilization \n\nOne  case  study,  on  Tuvalu\u2019s  Falekaupule [ 48 ]  trust  fund  (FTF), \nlooked specifically  at use of a  funding mechanism to support \nCD.  The  FTF  was  conceived  in  the  1990s  as  a  mechanism  to \nhelp build capacity for outer island development, building on \nthe  experience  of  the  Tuvalu  trust  fund,  which  had  already \ndemonstrated its worth since 1987.  \n\nThe FTF was seen as a response to difficulties experienced with \nother development programming modalities. As the case study \nauthor Brian Bell noted: \n\n\u201cHaving just observed the difficulties of implementing \nprojects  under  existing  modalities  it  was  clear  a \ndifferent  approach  was  needed.

The difficulties obtaining spare parts in a timely \nand  cost  effective  way,  the  lack  of  key  skills,  and \naccess to practical advice when needed seemed to be \noverwhelming.\u201d [ 49 ]\n\nAs  Bell  noted,  there  was  also  very  little  by  way  of  resources \nand  capacity  to  \u201cbalance  up  the  negatives.\u201d  This  led  to  the \nidea of a fund that would \u201cput the power in the hands of the \ncommunity members, where  they could decide which projects \nwere funded, and where there was access to skills and advice at \ncritical times to lift the participation and sustainability level.\u201d [ 50 ]\nCommunities  invested  their  savings  in  the  fund  (matched  by \ngovernment  funds), [ 51 ]  which  provided  a  significant  incentive \nfor local contributions, resulting in a strong sense of ownership \nin fund-related development activities.\n\nOne lesson from the FTF case was the importance of widespread \neducation programs to ensure understanding of and broad-based \ncommitment to the fund. However, the case also recognized that \nFTF, and other similar funds, are likely to require ongoing TA, \ngiven the significant capacity constraints faced by micro states, \nsuch as Tuvalu. Among the constraints noted was the absence of \ncounterpart staff from the executing agency, some of whom were \naway on long-term training during the project period. Looking \nto the future, the case also identified the difficulties faced by the \nresponsible ministry in retaining staff because of its \u201cperceived \nlack of prestige,\u201d another capacity constraint. \n\nNevertheless,  according  to  the  case  author  and  ADB\u2019s  own \nassessment, the program was successful. \u201cThe technical assistance \nachieved its outputs. Capacity has been built in the Ministry of \n\n49 \n50 \n51 \n\n  Bell 2007. p. 1.\n  Bell 2007. p. 2.\n  Matching was initially on a dollar-for-dollar basis but eventually was capped. \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  45\n\n\fHome Affairs and Rural Development and the establishment of \nthe FTF has provided a source of development revenue for island \ncommunities. Recent poor performance on financial markets has \naffected  returns  from  the  FTF,  but  the  fund  should  provide  a \nsustainable source of revenue over the long-term.\u201d [ 52 ]\n\nl.  Doing it without Donors\n\nOne of the case studies chosen for this research was selected, at \nleast in part, because it has not involved any support from an \nexternal donor agency. The Star Mountain Investment Holding \nLimited (SMIHL) is a PNG landowner holding company operating \nin Western Province of PNG, in the shadows of the huge Ok Tedi \nmine. The case tells the story of how SMIHL and its constituent \nparts mobilized themselves and enhanced their collective capacity \nas  agents  for  sustainable  economic  development,  drawing  on \nthe Lamin Trust, the Future Generation Fund for the mine area \ncommunity.    \n\nThe  initiative  evolved  out  of  years  of  frustration  with  wasted \nopportunities  for  economic  development  in  the  mine  area, \ndespite massive generation of wealth by Ok Tedi. The case study \nattributed  these  missed  opportunities  to  such  factors  as  lack \nof  organizational  and  economic  development  capacity  in  the \nmine  community,  capture  of  benefits  by  local  elites,  and  the \nlack  of  consensus  on  how  to  address  the  community\u2019s  long-\nterm interests. The mismanagement of economic opportunities \nwas  discussed  with  local  communities  using  a  bilum  (string \nbag)  analogy. [ 53 ] As  case  author  Paulina  Siop  indicated:  \u201cThe \ncommunity was told that \u2018there were many holes in their benefits \n- bilum - so there was a need to patch up all the holes so food \ndoes not drop from the holes.\u2019\u201d  [ 54 ]\n\nSMIHL came into existence following an extensive community \nconsultation process, facilitated by Papua New Guineans, which \ndrew in the three generations of mine stakeholders. Soon after \nits establishment, SMIHL bid on and won a contract; the Tabubil \nSuper Store business became Star Mountain\u2019s first investment. \nAccording to the case study, SMIHL has progressed well since \n\n52  Bell 2007. p. 18.\n53  A bilum is a traditional string bag used in Papua New Guinea to carry various items, from food \n\nto babies.  \n54  Siop 2007. p. 8. \n\n 46 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fOk Tedi mine    (Source: Ok Tedi Mine CMCA Review - www.wanbelistap.com)\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  47\n\n\fwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n 48 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fthen, displaying \u201csolid performances over the last three years.\u201d \nJust a few years after start up, the company is worth \u201cover K7 \nmillion [  55  ]  with  three  subsidiary  companies,  and  a  property \ndevelopment  and  transport  business  divisions.  SMIHL  also \nhas a management development program to support the local \nbusinesses of the community and the company employs up to \nthirty persons in its operation. The future growth potential for \nthe  company  is  enormous.  It  is  currently  negotiating  a  joint \nventure arrangement with an Australian company for a major \ncontract with Ok Tedi Mining Limited on a mine waste disposal \nproject.\u201d [ 56 ]\n\nAmong  other  things,  the  case  highlights  the  value  of  locally-\nled and facilitated change processes, with all the concomitant \nunderstanding of local  cultural dynamics and capacity issues. \nCommunity  consultation  was  also  seen  as  key  because  it \n\u201cpaved  the  way  for  community  acceptance  and  cooperation \nwith  the  program.  In  a  community  that  had  no  savings  and \ninvestment culture and that had developed a general distrust for \nlocal businesses, the consultation approach had to be carefully \nplanned. The community needed to have a sense of ownership \ntoward the program but most importantly take proactive steps \nto change its savings and investment behavior.\u201d [ 57 ] So far that \nobjective seems to have been realized. \n\n2. \n\nKey Factors Influencing \u201cSuccess\u201d\n\nThe case studies and the literature reviewed for this report point \nto a number of factors that appear to be common to the more \n\u201dsuccessful\u201d  examples  of  CD.  Many  of  these  reflect  the  \u201daid \neffectiveness\u201d agenda (Paris Declaration and Pacific Principles \nfor  Effective  Aid).  These  are  explored  below,  with  particular \nattention to how they relate specifically to CD.  \n\na.  Participation and ownership\n\nThe  case  studies  and  other  initiatives  covered  in  this  review \ndisplayed  a  relatively  high  level  of  developing-country \nownership  at  various  levels,  including  key  stakeholders  and \n\n55  1 kina = US$0.35.\n56  Siop 2007. p. 11.\n57  Siop 2007. p. 8.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  49\n\n\fopinion leaders. This sense of ownership was usually associated \nwith  a  common  vision  (often  emerging  from  participatory \napproaches) and coordination among key actors\u2014not just within \nsingle departments or agencies, but across governments and with \ncivil society.  \n\nAusAID\u2019s institutional strengthening project (ISP) with Vanuatu\u2019s \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management  (not  a  case \nstudy), for example, was described as being based on a \u201cstrong \nsense from individuals of what they wanted.\u201d The fact that the \nproject was based out of the treasury department, rather than \nbeing run through a project implementation unit contributed to \nthis sense of ownership. A similar sentiment was conveyed in the \nPPII case study, which showed an intent under that program to \n\u201dsupport existing systems and processes and to build on them,\u201d \npartly out of a recognition that introducing new systems would \n\u201cinevitably create dissonances.\u201d  \n\nThe  treasury  institutional  strengthening  project  in  Samoa \n(AusAID),  also  not  a  case  study,  but  linked  to  other  reforms \nbeing  studied  by  case  researchers,  underlined  the  importance \nof  government  capacity  to  mobilize  and  coordinate  donor \nresources,  another  important  aspect  of  ownership.  According \nto  a  review  of  the  project,  the  project  also  reflected  a  \u201cdeep \ncommitment  to  organizational  capacity  building\u201d  on  the  part \nof the Government of Samoa and a participatory approach to \norganizational reforms. \n\nAn advisory group review of the Tonga health sector planning and \nmanagement project (AusAID) noted the strong and committed \nleadership from the minister and director (as having) \u201chelped to \nbring about significant change in the management, culture and \nwork practices of the Ministry.\u201d The report also referred to the \n\u201cparallel development of a number of wider public sector reforms \nthat reinforce, and are reinforced by, the project.\u201d \n\nThe Tongan and Samoan cases described above are both examples \nof the convergence of clear local ownership (from the highest \nlevels), based on a shared vision and sense of ownership and a \npurposeful approach to capacity issues, including recognition of \nthe importance of management and organizational issues and \ninterorganizational collaboration to sector performance (i.e., a \nsystems approach).\n\n 50 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fSeveral  other  examples  from  a  desk  review  of  ADB  TA  also \nhighlighted the importance of local ownership and broad-based \nparticipation.  Under  the  improving  corporate  management  in \ngovernment services TA (Cook Islands), ADB helped government \nministries,  agencies,  and  outer  island  councils  establish  an \napproach  to  strategy  development  and  business  planning. \nThe  commitment  and  ownership  of  various  stakeholders, \neffective counterpart teams, and the regular convening of the \nsteering  committee  were  seen  as  centrally  important  in  this \ninitiative. Lessons from the project included the importance of \nparticipation from the beginning, sharing ideas, testing ideas in \na nonthreatening environment, and peer reviews. \n\nIn  the  strengthening  capacity  for  macroeconomic  analysis, \nplanning  and  policy  formation  ADB-sponsored  TA  (Samoa), \nthe  Government  insisted  on  a  leadership  role  (the  deputy \nsecretary  served  as  team  leader),  which  led  to  or  reinforced \nthe  sense  of  commitment  or  ownership  by  local  stakeholders. \nThrough  this  TA,  the  capacity  of  the  treasury  department  to \nundertake macroeconomic analysis and policy formulation was \n\u201csignificantly enhanced,\u201d according to the completion report.\n\nHarmonization  is  supposed  to  enhance  local  ownership  in \ndevelopment cooperation processes. As the Cooks Islands case \nstudy  on  aid  harmonization  notes:  \u201cThe  Aid  Management \nDivision  (AMD)  has,  in  fact,  increased  its  capacity  to  ensure \nthat the key executing agencies in the Cook Islands are aware \nof  their  responsibilities  vis  \u00e0  vis  the  harmonized  program\u2026\n(The) capacity to manage implementation of the harmonized aid \nprogram does not rest solely with the AMD only, but needs to \nbe assumed as well by all implementing agencies\u2014government, \nprivate  sector,  or  NGO.  AMD  has  fostered  this  broader  sense \nof  ownership  in  the  aid  harmonization  process,  working  with \nthe  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  (OPM)  to  support  the  NSDP \n[National  Sustainable  Development  Plan],  and  the  national \nM&E [monitoring and evaluation] system that the OPM\u2019s Policy \nDivision is designing.\u201d [ 58 ]\n\nThe PPII also displays a high level of ownership. According to \nthe case study, this has been aided by corporate strengthening \nsupport  under  the  program  to  DPLGA,  which  allowed  it  to \n\n58 Wichman 2007. p. 14. \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  51\n\n\f\u201creinvent itself\u201d and take on \u201centhusiastic leadership\u201d of PPII. \nThis has led to increased support for DPLGA from PNG\u2019s central \nagencies, including higher budget allocations, which is key to \nsustainability of the program. PPII has also displayed a high level \nof local ownership in the approach to CD; PNG stakeholders have \nplayed a central role in the diagnosis of capacity weaknesses and \nthe preparation of CD plans, with the provincial administration \nteam taking the lead in determining what capacity issues are to \nbe addressed and how, in their province.  \n\nThe  significance  of  developing-country  ownership  has  been \nechoed  in  many  reviews  and  evaluations,  including  the  2005 \nInternational Monetary Fund evaluation of technical assistance, \nwhich found, among other things, a strong correlation between \nthe level of ownership and involvement of local authorities in \npreparation of terms of reference. [ 59 ] In the RMI youth services \ncase,  Marie  Madison,  who  served  with  the  largest  women\u2019s \nnongovernment organization in the country at the time of the \ninitiative, noted that \u201cOne of the good points about the TA project \nwas the consultative exchanges with the youth and community \nmembers. Problem assessment techniques and planning exercises \nprovided for real people (particularly youth) participation.\u201d [ 60 ]\n\nThe case study on development of Nauru\u2019s national sustainable \ndevelopment  strategy  described  how  a  Nauruan  social \ndevelopment  analyst  was  included  on  the  contract  team  and \ntwo government officials were appointed to the project out of \nrecognition  of  the  need  for  local  ownership  and  with  a  view \nto  strengthening  internal  capacity  through  the  initiative. \nDesignation of the Ministry of Finance as the executing agency \nalso reinforced the sense of ownership, and gave the project team \nhigh-level policy and decision-making access.\n\nIn the Tuvalu trust fund case, devolving responsibility to manage \nouter island development was seen as key, particularly in light \nof the shortcomings in previous centrally-driven approaches. It \nwas anticipated that such a shift would enhance ownership of \ninitiatives arising from the new trust fund, but as the planners \nrecognized,  it  would  have  to  be  accompanied  by  a  process \nto  increase  local  capacity.  Under  the  fund  arrangements,  as \n\nInternational Monetary Fund, Independent Evaluation Office 2005. \n\n59 \n60  Graham 2007b. p. 7.\n\n 52 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fnoted,  communities  invested  their  savings  in  fund-sponsored \ndevelopment initiatives, which further enhanced their sense of \nownership in the fund and associated development activities. \n\nWhile ownership is uniformly recognized as being central to CD \nefforts, it can also be illusory in the absence of capacity, or where \ncapacity is weak. Despite the generally positive examples cited \nabove, this remains a challenge throughout the Pacific, given the \nfragility of state institutions and, in many instances, the limited \ninvolvement  of  communities  in  development  processes.  In \nrecognition of that, ADB\u2019s 2006 Capacity Development Thematic \nReport [ 61 ] noted a need for ADB to strengthen local ownership \nand leadership and to facilitate change management processes \nmore effectively than it already does. \n\nThe  graphic  below  offers  a  simple  characterization  of  the \nrelationship between ownership and effectiveness, with some of \nthe capacity implications cited in Box 3. \n\nD\n\nC\n\nHigh \nownership, \nlow \neffectiveness\n\nHigh \nownership, \nhigh \neffectiveness\n\nLow \nownership, \nlow \neffectiveness\n\nLow \nownership, \nhigh \neffectiveness\n\nownership\n\nHigh\n\nA\n\nB\n\nLow\n\neffectiveness\n\nLow\n\n61  ADB 2006h. \n\nHigh\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  53\n\n\fBox 3: Capacity Development ownership versus effectiveness\n\nQuadrant A:  High ownership, low effectiveness \u2013 This can be \nthe case at the outset of an initiative when developing-country \npartners have taken a strong interest or leadership role, but do not \nhave sufficient capacity at that stage to translate clear intentions \ninto  effective  performance.  Nevertheless,  potential  is  there  to \nfacilitate transition to \u2018D\u2019. \n\nQuadrant B: Low ownership, low effectiveness \u2013 This is typical of \ninitiatives driven by external stakeholders. They get \u201dstuck\u201d in this \nquadrant and fail to move beyond it because local stakeholders \ndo not commit resources (human, financial, physical) to support \nsustainable change. \n\nQuadrant C: Low ownership, high effectiveness \u2013 This quadrant is \ncharacteristic of initiatives run by project implementation units. \nThey may be efficient and effective in terms of delivering services \nor providing support, but are not likely to lead to sustainable \ncapacity changes because they are not imbedded in local systems; \nthus, they are considered low in terms of ownership. \n\nQuadrant D: High ownership, high effectiveness \u2013 This is the ideal, \nbut may not be realized in the short to medium term due to either \ncapacity shortcomings or constraints in the enabling environment. \nInterventions should focus on facilitating movement towards this \nquadrant.\n\nb.  leadership and Vision \n\nVarious  case  studies\u2014including  the  Tonga  health  sector \nplanning  and  management  project,  and  the  ADB-funded \nstrengthening capacity for macroeconomic analysis, planning, \nand policy formation in Samoa\u2014underlined the importance of \nlocal leadership to the success of reform processes, including \nthose  focused  on  CD.  In  the  various  cases,  local  champions \nprovided  the  space,  leadership,  and  legitimacy  for  processes \nthat  led  to  effective  utilization  of  local  capacity  or  ensured \nthat capacity deficiencies could be addressed in an open and \nsystematic  manner.  While  leaders  or  champions  often  came \nfrom the ranks of politicians or senior bureaucrats, they also \ncame  from  civil  society,  e.g.,  nongovernment  organizations, \nchurch, or youth leaders whose drive, energy, or vision opened \nup possibilities for addressing capacity issues for the benefit of \ntheir fellow citizens. \n\nThe  Cook  Islands  donor  harmonization  case  cited  above \nillustrates the importance of leadership capacity. In this case, \n\n 54 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fthe  leadership  provided  by  the  Aid  Management  Division \n(AMD) contributed to a new vision and development plan for \nthe  country,  which  also  positioned  that  division  to  assume \nmore of a leadership role in development cooperation issues, \nan important consideration in light of the Cook Islands\u2019 move \ntoward  increased  harmonization.  AMD\u2019s  leadership  not  only \nled the aid reforms but also recognized the necessity of dealing \nexplicitly with internal capacity issues, specifically enhancing \nthe size and capabilities of the AMD for planning and so that \nthey could offer better support to other government units. In the \nprocess, AMD\u2019s leadership set out to \u201cinstitutionalize\u201d their new \nresponsibilities. This example highlights a distinction between \n\u201dleadership of a cause\u201d\u2014an important role\u2014and leadership that \nis reflective on and able to address capacity issues effectively. \nOften  one  occurs  without  the  other,  but  in  this  case,  it  was \nthe combination of these two leadership qualities that helped \nexplain AMD\u2019s ability to progress as it did. \n\nIn the RMI youth services case, government leadership was seen \nas necessary, given the holistic nature of the interventions and \nthe need to engage a range of actors, including nongovernment \norganizations and other nonstate actors. In this case though, \nlack of leadership and political support ultimately diminished \nthe  impact  of  the  interventions,  despite  well-laid  plans  and \nstrategies. \n\nLeadership  manifested  itself  in  different  ways.  In  PPII,  the \ncapacity  building  division  of  DPLGA  serves  as  \u201dstrategic \nmanager,\u201d  while  PPII\u2019s  steering  committee  \u201dled\u201d  by  bringing \ntogether  national  agencies  and  provinces.  PPII  also  actively \nencourages  provincial  leadership  through  the  provincial \nmanagement  teams.  Several  other  cases  highlighted  how  a \ngenerational  change  in  leadership  opened  the  door  to  new \nideas  and  thinking  in  the  country,  creating  a  more  enabling \nenvironment for change.\n\nSome case studies also highlighted the importance of domestic \ncapacity to develop a clear and shared vision to effectiveness of \nCD efforts. The Cook Islands case on Harmonizing Aid Delivery \nin the Cook Islands, Making things simpler? [ 62 ] tells that story \n\n62 \n\n Wichman, V. 2007a.

(Draft)\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  55\n\n\ffrom the perspective of Garth Henderson, director of AMD. As \ndescribed in the case: \n\n\u201cThe organizational landscape in the AMD was fairly \nrugged at the time. For one thing, Garth had to come \nto  terms  with  the  fact  that  the  Division  was  poorly \nresourced, in terms of staffing, equipment and technical \nsupport. There was also a low sense of ownership of \nthe aid programs in  the  country;  limited capacity in \nnational  and  sector  planning,  and  project  analysis \nand  implementation;  no  shared  national  vision  due \nto repeated changes of government, poor integration \nwith  other  agencies  of  government  involved  in \nimplementing  aid  projects;  political  interventions \nat  inappropriate  stages  that  influenced  delivery  of \nprojects;  and  under  expenditure  throughout  the  aid \nprograms.\u201d \u2026 \u201cTo develop this capacity within the AMD, \nand  with  partner  agencies,  he  believed  it  important \nthat a national vision and shared sense of direction be \ndeveloped by all stakeholders\u201d\u2026\u201cThis realization led to \nthe National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP), a \ndocument that \u201clays out the country\u2019s overall direction \nand priorities for development (and, therefore, national \nand aid funding).\u201d  Garth saw  this  plan as \u201ca step in \nthe right direction that will dramatically improve the \nextent to which we plan and implement development in \nthe future. As he stated, \u2018We cannot effectively engage \nwith donors unless we know where we are going. NSDP \nis a start\u2019\u201d. [ 63 ]\n\n \nc. \n\nCapacity to Demand \n\nThis  section  explores  the  role  of  developing-country  actors \nin  articulating  and  shaping  demand  for  change.  Of  particular \ninterest  are  (i)  cases  in  which  CD  initiatives  came  about  as  a \nresult  of  \u201ddemands\u201d  of  local  stakeholders,  and  (ii)  initiatives \nthat focused explicitly on enhancing local capacity for demand, \nsuch  as  through  support  for  nongovernment  organizations  or \ncommunity-based groups. \n\nThe  community  justice  liaison  unit  (CJLU)  in  PNG,  as  noted \nabove,  is  still  in  its  early  stages,  but  offers  some  insights  on \n\n 56 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n63 Wichman 2007a. p. 6, 7, 10. \n\n\fthe possibilities of increasing civil society capacity for demand, \nservice  delivery,  and  advocacy,  especially  in  the  context  of \nbroadly-based ownership of a reform process and shared interests \namong civil society and government actors. \n\nSeveral of the ADB TAs reviewed for this study yielded other \ninsights on the potential for externally-funded TA to enhance \ndomestic  capacity  for  demand.  The  ADB  TA  for  Kiribati  - \ncommunity  development  and  sustainable  participation,  2002\u2013\n2005,  for  example,  was  complementary  to  an  ongoing  ADB \nloan to support improvements in sanitation, public health, and \nenvironment.  The  TA  concentrated  on  mobilizing  community \nsupport and is described in the case study from Kiribati \u2013 A Tale \nof Two CDs [ 64 ], which notes that the first generation of water and \nsanitation (WATSAN) reforms in the country\u2014which had focused \nmainly on hardware\u2014had fallen short of expectations. However, \nthe next generation of interventions, which are covered in the \ncase study, brought in the community participation component \nthat the Government of Kiribati had come to recognize as key \nto  sustainability.  The  second  generation  of  interventions  was \nsupported  by  ADB-sponsored  TA  projects,  which  sought  to \ninstitutionalize community participation in Kiribati\u2019s WATSAN \nefforts.  The  interventions  involved  consultations  with  75 \ncommunity  groups  and  improving  their  capacity  to  address \ncommunity  issues  and  to  influence  attitudes  and  behavior \nregarding WATSAN issues.  \n\nIn RMI, the ADB-funded TA, preparing the youth social services \nproject, 2004\u20132005, assisted the Government to refocus policies \nand  expenditures  on  priority  issues  affecting  youth.  It  also \nactively encouraged demand for youth-specific services, through \nparticipatory workshops and use of the media to raise awareness \nof  relevant  issues.  The  TA  completion  report  highlighted  the \nimportance  of  participatory  processes  and  the  provision  of \nkey  staff  by  government.  The  initiative  was  described  as  \u201can \nexample for the region\u201d and the case study highlighted how the \nTA intervention helped civil society actors and youth articulate \ntheir interests and demands for change. \n\nThe desk review identified an example in PNG that highlights \nthe  experience  of  a  national  affiliate  of  an  international \n\n64 \n\n Mackenzie, Ueantabo. 2007.

With support from the \nEuropean Union, WWF PNG has supported local communities \ninterested  in  setting  up  wildlife  management  areas  (WMAs). \nIn the PNG context, landowners need to secure the permission \nof  the  Minister  of  Environment  and  Conservation  to  set  up  a \nWMA. WWF is authorized to work with communities that have \nexpressed an interest to do so, and once the WMA is gazetted, \nWWF  actively  supports  the  community\u2019s  efforts  to  protect \nwildlife  and  to  support  environmentally  sensitive  economic \ndevelopment activities.\n\nThe interesting aspect of the WMA process from a CD perspective \nis the \u201c10 Steps for Landowners.\u201d Through a 10-step process, the \nwhole community chooses the  type of conservation area they \nwant.  They  establish  an  agreement  among  themselves,  decide \non rules and sanctions and a wildlife management committee, \nbefore asking the government to declare a WMA. The process is \none of community empowerment; WWF supports the process of \ndecision making, disengaging as appropriate when communities \nneed to make decisions on their own, and then re-entering when \nthe communities have decided on the type of support they want \nfrom WWF. WWF\u2019s role is recognized by the Government and the \nWMA is sanctioned under national legislation, giving legitimacy \nto the process.    \n\nd.  Relevance, Readiness, and Receptivity \n\nSome  cases  highlight  how  \u201dsuccess\u201d  was  more  likely  when \nexternal CD interventions were linked to processes and priorities \nseen as highly relevant by local stakeholders. For example, the \n2005 AusAID technical advisory group review of the Tonga health \nsector planning and management project (1999\u20132007) underlined \nthe  importance  of  its  project  design,  which  focused  on  \u201cthe \nneeds identified by the Ministry of Health staff themselves.\u201d The \nTuvalu trust fund and the Kiribati revenue equalization reserve \nfund were also seen as relevant by local stakeholders because \nthey  helped  to  secure  much  needed  long-term  public  sector \nfinance. Similarly, CD in the Nauru case study was aligned with \ndevelopment of their national sustainable development strategy, \na centrally important planning document for the country. While \nidentifying  \u201drelevance\u201d  as  an  important  success  factor  may \nseem  self  evident,  the  apparent  lack  of  commitment  by  local \n\n 58 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\nwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\fstakeholders  in  some  initiatives  suggests  that  relevance  needs \nto be validated, for example, through participatory consultative \nprocesses, rather than assumed. \n\n\u201dAppropriateness\u201d is another success factor that may seem self \nevident, i.e., making sure that CD inputs match development and \ncapacity needs, whether it be technical advisors, institutional or \npolicy support, linkages, or twinning arrangements. What the \ncases show, as does the CD literature, is that interventions need \nto be appropriate in the given country or community context. \nIn  other  words,  context  (in  all  its  meanings)  matters  greatly. \nConsequently, there can be no blueprint for CD, no \u201done size fits \nall.\u201d This means that the key features of the programming context \n(such as policy environment, relationships among stakeholders, \ncapacity  strengths  and  shortcomings,  and  political  economy \nfactors)  need  to  be  captured  during  assessment  processes. \nNevertheless, designs for CD interventions are still often overly \nambitious and assumptions about capacity or the project context \nare wrong, resulting in few sustainable achievements. Even many \nof the \u201dsuccesses\u201d reviewed for this study highlighted concerns \nabout sustaining capacity gains realized during the course of the \ninvestment, in part due to inadequate initial analysis of relevant \nfactors.  \n\nThe  case  studies  also  point  to  the  importance  of  readiness  or \nreceptivity  as  a  precondition  or  enabling  factor  for  effective \nCD. Much of this relates to, or is rooted in, some of the points \ndiscussed above\u2014ownership, the existence of local champions, \nor  effective  demand.  In  Vanuatu\u2019s  institutional  strengthening \nproject with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management, \nthe  emphasis  in  the  initial  stage  on  stakeholders\u2019  becoming \nfamiliar with each other enhanced organizational readiness to \nchange. The combination of organizational readiness, enabling \nfactors (e.g., the existence of appropriate legislation), ensuring \nsufficient time for the initiative to unfold, and provision of valued \ninputs in this case led to an upward virtuous cycle of change \nthat included increased confidence in the Government among \nexternal stakeholders and resulted in direct budgetary support \nand funding through the Millennium Challenge Account.\n\nIn several cases, readiness or receptivity to change was increased, \nor even provoked, by the onset of a crisis (political, economic, \nor climate-related). In these cases, the crises appeared to open \n\n 60 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fup  space  for  thinking  about  things  differently.  In  the  Cook \nIslands,  for  example,  the  Government  was  headed  toward  an \neconomic crisis in the mid-1990s, which provided the impetus \nfor the economic reform program that followed. However, the \ncase writer invoked a biblical story, cautioning that \u201cthe seed \nthat falls on rocky ground will not grow properly,\u201d suggesting \nthat while the crisis provided the opportunity, it did not really \nconstitute ideal circumstances for enduring benefits. \n\nThe RMI fishery reforms were also borne out of a crisis in the \nsector that led to sector stakeholders recognizing that fundamental \nchanges were required. This led to the changes described in the \ncase study, but in this instance, the reforms have largely been \nsustained due to the real and measurable improvements in the \nsector, and leadership capacity that has driven the process over \nan extended period of time. \n\nCrisis  or  not,  the  cases  suggest  that  relevance,  readiness,  and \nreceptivity to change are important factors meriting attention \nat  the  outset,  particularly  in  fragile  states  with  limited \nplanning,  management,  and  technical  capacity,  significant \ninstitutional  constraints,  political  tensions,  civil  unrest,  and \nweak economies. \n\ne. \n\nInvesting in understanding\n\nThe case studies provided substantial evidence on the importance \nof understanding the programming context\u2014a constant theme \nin the CD literature. This point was brought home in the RMI \nyouth social services case: \u201cA large part of the TA was spent up \nfront on the situation analysis. This analysis brought together a \nsubstantial amount of information which related to youth issues \nand the research was enhanced by information collected through \nthe participatory workshops.\u201d [ 65 ]\n\nSimilarly, the development of the Nauru Sustainable Development \nStrategy was grounded in a broadly participatory process that \nimproved  understanding  of  community  aspirations,  while \nstrengthening  their  capacity  to  be  active  participants  in  such \nprocesses. \n\n65 Graham 2007b. p. 7.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  61\n\n\fAs  suggested  earlier,  investing  specifically  in  understanding \ncapacity issues was less apparent in the cases, being a significant \nfeature only in those initiatives with a clear CD mandate, as in \nPPII and the TA facilities in PNG.  \n\nf.   getting the Incentives Right\n\nIncentives and motivations played a significant part in several \ncase studies. Incentives generally refer to such measures as salaries \nor indirect benefits (scholarships, access to training programs, \nsubsidized  housing,  etc.),  but  can  also  include  less  tangible \nbenefits,  such  as  recognition  for  performance  or  provision \nof  a  positive,  affirming,  and  professionally  rewarding  work \nenvironment. Individuals in some case studies were also motivated \nby less self-interested considerations, including commitment to \nan organizational goal or broader community interests. The cases \nalso demonstrated the influence of negative motivators, such as \nthe debilitating influence of unstable environments, the absence \nof  rule  of  law,  or  lack  of  engagement  of  civil  society,  any  of \nwhich can undermine capacity or drive it away. \n\nAs  reported  in  the  PPII  case,  progressive  demoralization  and \ndisillusionment of provincial administrative staff were significant \ncapacity weaknesses and a risk that had to be addressed. One \nway PPII has addressed the incentives issue at the institutional \nlevel is to make \u201dgraduation\u201d from one phase of the program \nto the next contingent on provincial teams\u2019 meeting specified \ncapacity criteria, such as completion of a capacity building plan, \nor  improvement  in  public  administration  systems.  Incentives \nprovided in the program include  up to K250,000 per year for \ncapacity  building  programs  (Phase  I)  and  K0.5  million\u20131.0 \nmillion per annum for infrastructure support (Phase II). \n\nIn the Kiribati water and sanitation case, stakeholders relied on a \ncombination of public education and mobilization and legislative \nchanges to induce changes in behavior\u2014positive and negative \nmotivators. In this case, the approach chosen was based on a \nrecognition that mobilizing or educating people to \u201ddo the right \nthing\u201d may not always be enough and may need to be combined \nwith sanctions for behavior that goes against public interest\u2014in \nthis case, amendments to the penal code to increase penalties for \npeople who vandalized water and sanitation facilities. \n\n 62 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fThe  Tonga  health  management  case  highlighted  the  potential \nlimitations  of  more  altruistic  motivations.  As  noted:  \u201cOn \nentry  into  the  service,  doctors  were  slotted  into  departments \nwhere  it  was  assumed  that  tending  to  the  needs  of  patients \nwould be sufficient incentive for them to perform and to stay \nengaged. However\u2026frustration or thirst for further knowledge \nor  experiences  usually  drove  them  to  leave  the  service  either \nthrough retirement, resignation, or migration.\u201d [ 66 ] The  Tongan \nGovernment recognized the need to respond or see its medical \ncapacity  diminish.  According  to  the  case,  the  Government \nsucceeded  by  providing  refresher  courses  and  rotating  young \ndoctors to different locations, which not only exposed them to a \nbroad range of experiences, but also gave them an opportunity \nto acquire valuable management experience. \n\nOther examples from the cases that have, explicitly or otherwise, \nrelied on incentives or tapped into individual or organizational \nmotivations include using locally-managed development funds; \nproviding  local  personnel  space  to  use  and  further  develop \nor  consolidate  their  own  capacity  in  the  absence  of  external \nadvisors; encouraging and rewarding local innovation; respecting \nlocal knowledge and traditions; bringing civil society actors into \nthe policy and programming mainstream; and aligning donor \nsystems with those of the Pacific island countries.\n\nFinally on the issue of incentives, Peter Morgan reminds us of \nthe  potential  for  a  disconnection  between  donors,  with  their \ntraditional  focus  on  outputs  and  outcomes,  and  developing-\ncountry partners that do not necessarily reward or sanction on \nthe  basis  of  predicted,  measured  results. [ 67 ]  Such  differences, \nwhich  reflect  different  institutional  incentives,  can  affect \ncollaboration  and  shared  sense  of  responsibility  for  results, \nincluding those aimed at enhancing capacity, between donors \nand recipient countries.  \n\ng.  enabling environment \n\nAccording to various CD definitions, the \u201denabling environment\u201d \nrefers  to  the  policies,  institutional  arrangements,  attitudes, \nvalues,  and  other  factors  in  the  project  or  program  context \n\n66 \n67 \n\n Tu\u2019itahi 2007a. p. 3.\n Morgan 2007. p. 4. \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  63\n\n\fthat can potentially support or detract from CD processes. The \nADB  CD  framework  refers  specifically  to  the  \u201dpublic  sector \ninstitutional framework\u201d as an important aspect of the broader \nenabling environment. For ADB, this includes poverty reduction \nstrategies and plans, public financial management, subnational \ngovernance,  administrative  and  legislative  reforms,  and  civil \nsociety  participation,  among  other  dimensions.  The  \u201dsuccess\u201d \nof some cases in this study can be attributed, to a considerable \ndegree, to factors in the enabling environment that enabled the \ninitiatives to proceed better than might otherwise have been the \ncase. Many of these factors have already been referred to in the \nsections  above  and  include  committed  leadership,  appropriate \npolicies, organizational readiness, and broad societal consensus \nrooted in participatory processes.  \n\nInterestingly,  the  European  Centre  for  Development  Policy \nManagement  (ECDPM)  study  on  capacity,  change,  and \nperformance, which included two cases studies from the Pacific \nregion, pointed out that: \n\n\u201cIt is not always true, as conventional wisdom would \nsuggest,  that  the  \u2018enabling  environment\u2019,  needed \nto  be  positive.  Organizations  in  seemingly  adverse \nconditions went from strength to strength while those \nin  overtly  much  more  favourable  circumstances  did \nless well.\u201d [ 68 ]\n\nThis  somewhat  counterintuitive  finding  was  attributed  in  the \nECDPM  cases  to  inspired  leadership,  shared  values  among \nstakeholders,  strong  relationships,  and  incentive  systems  that \ncontributed to the flourishing of capacity and performance in \nadverse circumstances. The study noted, however, that contexts \nare  dynamic  and  can  change,  so  the  relationship  between \ncontext,  capacity,  and  performance  likewise  can  be  fluid  and \nunpredictable. Some ECDPM cases also reflected on the capacity \nof stakeholders to manage or influence the context in which they \noperate and the implications of that for CD efforts. \n\nThis  \u201dcapacity  to  manage  the  environment\u201d  was  evident  in \nseveral  Pacific  cases,  examples  of  which  are  described  above. \nOther  cases  benefited  from  a  broad  reform  environment  that \n\n 64 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n68\n\nZinke 2006. p. 4.\n\n\fwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\nwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\f 66 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fprovided the enabling conditions for sector- or organizational-\nlevel reforms to proceed, including dealing with capacity issues, \nfor example, RMI\u2019s fishery reforms and Tonga\u2019s health reforms. \nThe Nauru case study also noted the importance of the enabling \nenvironment, which, the author remarked, included institutional, \npolitical, and informal leadership that \u201chelps to give permission \nto  the  new  approach,  legitimizes  the  outputs  from  the  new \napproach, and affirms the outcomes.\u201d [ 69 ]\n\nh.  Flexibility and Adaptivity \n\nWhile it may be intuitive to think that \u201dsuccessful\u201d CD efforts \nneed be rooted in clearly structured, systematic approaches, [ 70 ]\nexperience  suggests  it  is  not  necessarily  so.  One  factor  is  the \ncomplexity of the issue(s) being addressed\u2014the implication being \nthat change involving a broad set of actors or capacity levels \nis  likely  to  require  a  more  coordinated,  systematic  approach. \nAnother factor is the stability of the programming environment. \nMost initiatives reviewed for this study  could be described as \nsystematic in their approach, although many were also flexible, \nadapting  to  changing  demands  and  contextual  realities  as \nrequired.   \n\nADB\u2019s  support  for  the  Marshall  Islands  fisheries  development\nplan  used  a  systematic  approach  based  on  up-front  analysis, \nsequencing  of  inputs,  and  attention  to  sustainability  and  the \nsocial dimensions required to ensure broad-based ownership. The \ninitial support was a US$600,000 TA grant for the development \nof  the  national  plan,  including  an  in-depth  review  of  the \nfisheries\u2014institutional  analysis,  legislation,  policies,  marine \nresources, and environmental management. The review looked \nin particular at the role of the private sector, commercialization, \nand  potential  for  privatization.  The  purpose  of  the  follow-up \nTA was to \u201cconvert policy into practice,\u201d such as private sector \nmanagement practices, institutional reform, and a trust fund to \nspread the benefits of the expanding tuna fishery. ADB\u2019s future \nassistance was intended to strengthen public sector governance \nand productivity, increase community participation, and improve \nbasic services. \n\n69 \n70 \n\n Balm 2007. p. 20. \n By systematic is meant methodical, well-thought out plans and implementation strategies. \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  67\n\n\fPNG\u2019s PPII, discussed above, has also taken a systematic approach, \nbuilding  on  diagnoses  carried  out  during  the  pilot  phase  and \nmoving sequentially from one phase to the next based on agreed \ncriteria for advancement. Other initiatives examined as part of \nthis study, including Kiribati\u2019s water and sanitation project, also \nrecognized the value of sequencing capacity interventions and \ndovetailing activities, for example, public education programs \nand infrastructure development. \n\nWhile  the  above  examples  point  to  the  value  of  systematic \nor  structured  approaches  to  CD,  other  examples  from  the \ninternational literature [ 71 ] suggest that effective CD is not always \na product of tightly scripted designs. Rather it can be emergent \nand responsive to shifting local dynamics, as well as ongoing \nlearning  and  adaptation.  PNG\u2019s  PPII,  for  example,  which \nwas  described  above  as  a  relatively  structured  or  systematic \nintervention, also emphasizes moving at an \u201cappropriate pace\u201d \n(phased  approach),  providing  \u201dspace\u201d  for  PNG  colleagues  to \nwork  out  issues  on  their  own,  and  supporting  competency \ndevelopment and systemic issues simultaneously, suggesting a \nrecognition of the need to balance structure\u2014including a clear \nvision\u2014and flexibility. \n\ni. \n\neffective use of technical Advisors \n\nExtensive reliance on international technical advisors has been \nwidely criticized in the development literature, with critics often \ncharacterizing  it  as  ineffective  and  expensive. [ 72 ]  However,  a \n2006 OECD report suggested that \u201c\u2026although heavily criticized, \ntechnical co-operation is not \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 \u2013 it depends on \nhow it is used \u2026\u201d [ 73 ]\n\nVarious  approaches  to  the  use  of  TA  advisors  were  revealed \nin the case studies. These included long-term advisors, short-\nterm  advisors,  intermittent  advisors,  locally  based  resident \ninternational  advisors,  regionally  based  advisors,  and  local \nadvisors.  Some  \u201dadvised,\u201d  while  others  trained,  mentored,  or \nfacilitated; some served as change agents or controllers; some \nfocused on systems development or policy reform, or assumed \nimplementing roles. Some shared international best practices, \n\n71 \n72 \n73 \n\n See, for example, Morgan, Land, and Baser 2005. \n See, for example, Berg 1993.\n OECD 2006b. p. 3.\n\n 68 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fwhile others worked carefully within local systems to facilitate \nindigenous solutions while helping to improve local capacity. \nIn many cases, it was a combination of roles and approaches \n(see Appendix 4 for a list of different approaches to TA). \n\nThe  international  consultants  in  the  RMI  fisheries  case,  for \nexample, were engaged as advisors but over time moved beyond \nthat  role.  They  supported  the  Government\u2019s  privatization \nefforts  and  negotiation  of  fishery  access  agreements;  they \nsupported implementation of national policies and strategies, \nand  participated  in  public  hearings,  and  industry  and \nregional  meetings.  The  consultants  also  became  involved  in \nmarketing  RMI  as  a  destination  for  onshore  investments  in \nfisheries,  including  through  overseas  visits  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment\u2014initiatives  that  were  seen  as  opportunities  to \nbuild local capacity for marketing. In addition, the consultants \ninitiated  a  stock  taking  of  the  relevant  ministry\u2019s  strengths \nand weaknesses, an exercise which was institutionalized as an \nongoing board-level activity. According to the case study, this \nbroadening  of  the  advisor\u2019s  role  was  possible  because  of  the \n\u201cstrong  level  of  trust\u201d  that  had  been  developed  between  the \nministry and lead consultant. \n\nIn  the  Tongan  strategic  planning  case,  among  others,  the \nadvisors  served  as  change  agents  or  facilitators  as  much  as \ntechnical advisors, exposing local stakeholders to options for \nmoving  beyond  deeply  ingrained  practices,  such  as  highly \ncentralized  and  controlled  planning  processes,  to  more  open \nand participatory approaches. \n\nThe  Tuvalu  case  study  also  talks  about  the  value  of  relying \non local consultants. Referring to a 2000 UNDP evaluation, it \nindicates: \u201cThe fact that a Tuvaluan carried out the review was \nextremely important as it allowed access to views, information, \nand insights that are extremely difficult to obtain by an ex-pat \nconsultant.\u201d [ 74 ]\n\nThe literature on technical assistance and CD has a great deal \nto say about the importance of getting the right advisor\u2014the \nright mix of technical capabilities, personal attributes, cultural \n\n74 Bell 2007. p. 5. \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  69\n\n\fsensitivity, and openness to learning. As one source noted in \nthis review: \n\n\u201cConsultants or advisors  need  to  be culturally sensitive, good \nlisteners, and effective at facilitating change. You do not always \nneed the most highly \u2018qualified\u2019 expert.\u201d \n\nThis sentiment was echoed in the completion report for ADB\u2019s \nimplementation of state owned enterprise reforms TA in Samoa, \nwhich  suggested  that  technical  assistance  personnel  provided \nfor such interventions must be \u201capt communicators and capacity \nbuilders.\u201d\n\nOther  successes  identified  in  this  study  also  highlighted  the \nimportance of such factors as good personal relationships with \nlocal colleagues, solid knowledge of the local or national context, \nability to speak the local language, long-term engagement, and \nan ability to function in an advisory capacity and transfer skills \nwhile  leaving  space  for  local  colleagues  to  \u201cget  on  with  their \njobs.\u201d\n\nLong-term  engagement  of  advisors  was  noted  as  a  success \nfactor  in  ADB\u2019s  capacity  building  of  the  legal  sector  TA  in \nVanuatu,  2001\u20132002.  The  completion  report  noted  that  this \nintervention \u201csignificantly improved capacity\u201d in the state law \noffice and helped cultural change in the legal system. The report \nattributed this to the continuity and quality of the TA provided \n(a retired Queen\u2019s counsel); the fact that the advisor was based \nin-country;  and  the  mentoring  approach,  which  was  seen  as \nbuilding the confidence of local counterparts. Other interviewees \nalso commented on the value of \u201ccontinuous, ongoing support\u201d \n(versus fly-in, fly-out advisors). \n\nWhile continuity of advisors was clearly a positive factor in some \ncases, others demonstrated the value of short-term, intermittent \nengagement. In the ADB-funded Kiribati water and sanitation \ncase, for example, neither the team leader nor the specialists on \nthe international consultant team were residents in Kiribati for \nthe full duration of the project. This presented some challenges, \nparticularly  given  difficulties  in  communications,  but  it  gave \nthe  national  coordinator  and  other  local  staff  space  to  carry \nout their work with a degree of independence based on agreed \nwork plans. The case study on this initiative also referred to the \nimportance of the relationship between the advisors and the local \npartners, describing it as \u201ccordial and collaborative.\u201d Similarly, \n\n 70 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fthe Nauru case study refers to the intermittent presence of the \nteam leader and development economist, which provided local \nmembers of the project team \u201cspace and opportunity to assume \nresponsibility.\u201d  \n\nAs  various  examples  above  suggest,  the  effectiveness  of  TA \ndepends to a large extent on human dynamics. This is shaped, to \na considerable degree, by the personal and professional qualities \nof the advisor. However, much of it also hinges on the extent to \nwhich the process allows indigenous partners to use their own \ncapacity (existing or  emergent) to  find their own solutions to \ntheir particular challenges. This issue is addressed in Box 4.\n\nBox 4:   Helping People Help themselves \n\nFormer Word Bank official David Ellerman, in his book Helping \nPeople  Help  Themselves,  discusses  what  he  calls  the  \u201chelping \nconundrum\u201d:  \u201chow can an outside party (\u2019helper\u2019) assist those \nwho are undertaking autonomous activities (the \u2019doers\u2018) without \noverriding or undercutting their autonomy?\u201d Ellerman draws on \neight thinkers from different fields (including Dewey, Rogers, \nFreire, and Schumacher) highlighting points of commonality using \na framework of \u201chelpers\u201d trying to provide \u201cautonomy-compatible \nassistance\u201d to \u201cdoers.\u201d The points of commonality he identifies are \nas follows: \n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\nhelp must start from the present situation of the \ndoers\u2014not from a \u201dblank slate\u201d,\nhelpers must see the situation through the eyes of the \ndoers\u2014not just through their own eyes,\nhelp cannot be imposed upon the doers\u2014as that \ndirectly violates their autonomy, \nnor can doers receive help as a benevolent gift\u2014 as \nthat creates dependency, and\ndoers must be \u201cin the driver\u2019s seat\u201d\u2014which is the basic \nidea of autonomous self-direction.\n\nSource:  Ellerman,  David.  2005.

Ann  Arbor:  University  of \nMichigan Press.\n\nGiven the diversity of roles described above, and in Appendix \n4, it is clear that there is no \u201done size fits all\u201d for TA advisors. \nNevertheless,  the  cases  suggest,  consistent  with  the  Paris \nDeclaration  and  the  Pacific  Principles,  that  emphasis  in  TA \nassignments should clearly be on improving local capacity, or \nfinding ways to make more effective use of it, with a clear view \nto what lasts rather than simply what might work in the short \nterm. \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  71\n\n\fwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\fj. \n\nensuring Sufficient time\n\nA 1993 assessment by an AusAID team suggested that the water \nand sanitation problem in South Tarawa, Kiribati, was \u201ccritical \nand that it should be addressed in as comprehensive a manner \nas  possible  if  sustainable  and  effective  development  is  to  be \nachieved.\u201d [ 75 ] The team recommended a multidisciplinary, 10-year \nprogram to deal with the various dimensions in a coordinated \nmanner.  The  need  for  a  long-term  commitment  was  reflected \nin the design document which recognized that \u201cattitudinal and \nbehavioural change cannot occur overnight.\u201d\n\nThe PPII is another example of an initiative with a long-term \nperspective,  a  projected  time  frame  of  15\u201320  years.  The  PPII \ndesign also recognized the need to proceed at a pace consistent \nwith the capabilities and absorptive capacity of the provinces and \ndistricts involved. As indicated in the case study: \u201cThe focus and \npace of the CD process in each province is completely dictated \nand  controlled  by  each  provincial  administration.\u201d [  76  ]  The \ncapacity building service centre in PNG has also taken a long-\nterm view with respect to building capacity of the Department \nof Health and other sector actors. \n\nHowever, most of the cases reviewed were based on short time \nframes, with expectations for \u201ddeliverable results,\u201d in anywhere \nfrom 6 months to 4 years. In some instances, the time frames \nwere  insufficient  to  address  relevant  capacity  concerns  and, \nin  the  absence  of  follow-up  support,  local  stakeholders  were \nconcerned about sliding back to pre-project conditions.    \n\nk.  taking a Systems Approach \n\nAs  suggested  earlier,  the  idea  of  systems  thinking  has  gained \ncurrency  in  the  discourse  on  CD.  A  systems  approach  can \nbe  contrasted  with  what  may  be  described  as  more  linear  or \nreductionist  perspectives  on  capacity,  i.e.,  input  \u2018a\u2019  leads  to \noutput or outcome \u2018b,\u2019 which leads to change in performance \u2018c\u2019. \nAccording to systems thinking, rather than reducing capacity to \nits constituent parts and dealing with them as isolated entities, \n\n75 \n76 \n\n  Mackenzie 2007. p. 2.\n  Saldanha 2007. p. 8.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  73\n\n\fcapacity  is  seen  as  emerging  from  and  being  influenced  by  a \nbroader capacity system. Advocates of this perspective suggest \nthat  interventions  should  be  sensitive  to  capacity  in  different \nparts of the system, including how it evolves over time and, most \nimportantly, the relationships among capacity components. \n\nADB\u2019s CD framework, for example, is described as \u201ca system\u201d \nwith  three  main  dimensions:  organizations,  institutions, and \ninterorganization  and/or  group  relations.  As  noted  in  ADB\u2019s \nmedium-term framework and action plan, \u201cThe third dimension \nemphasizes  systems\u2026the  need  for  various  government  and \nnongovernment organizations and groups to act in partnership \nto  achieve  agreed  objectives.  It  focuses  on\u2026a  system  of \norganizations and groups in DMCs that are primarily responsible \nfor achieving certain development objectives.\u201d [ 77 ] The enhanced \nattention  to  capacity  systems  parallels  an  increasing  reliance \non  broader,  more  comprehensive  approaches  to  development, \nsuch as sector-wide approaches and program-based approaches. \nIts value is in trying to explain complex systems with multiple \nactors, operating in sometimes unpredictable contexts. \n\nA number of initiatives reviewed for this study reflect aspects of \na systems approach. Health sector reforms in PNG, for example, \nhave  increasingly  sought  to  address  governance  challenges, \nincluding those relating to decentralization, which are seen as \npotentially constraining sector reforms. This has required active \ncollaboration  among  health  sector  actors,  central  agencies, \nand  provincial  authorities,  and  has  led  to  legislative  changes \nand the introduction of administrative mechanisms to improve \nPNG\u2019s  decentralized  system.  These  system-wide  interventions \nhave been done in parallel with individual and organizational \ncapacity-building initiatives with actors within the sector. \n  \nThe UNDP provincial capacity building project in PNG seeks to \nstrengthen  national  and  provincial  financial  management.  As \nwith the health reforms mentioned above, the UNDP project has \nassisted provincial governments with their requirements under \nthe  1995  Organic  Law  on  Provincial  Governments  and  Local \nLevel  Governments  (OLPGLLG)\u2014PNG\u2019s  key  decentralization \nlegislation.  Thus,  the  project  is  intended  to  be  responsive  to \ninstitutional  and  policy  challenges  affecting  performance  at \n\n 74 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n77\n\nADB 2006g. p. 14.\n\n\fprovincial and district levels, in particular those associated with \nthe OLPGLLG. \n\nExperiences  with  a  systems  approach  described  in  this  paper \nunderline  the  need  to  invest  in  understanding  the  \u201dsystem,\u201d \nincluding  an  appreciation  of  the  dynamics  of  the  capacity \nsystem, possible strategic entry points, and a sense of how inputs \nmight be sequenced.  \n\nFinally,  experience  suggests  that  in  embracing  a  systems \napproach,  actors  may  have  to  make  choices  about  trade-offs \nbetween the potential for gaining access to new capacities, such \nas through formalizing structures, and the potential for loss of \nownership and flexibility. In other words, the incentives do not \nalways favor such approaches. Program-based approaches, for \nexample, that require collaboration among many actors (sector \nministries,  central  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations, \nprivate  sector  service  providers,  etc.),  have  to  deal  with  this \nchallenge on an ongoing basis. Ultimately, the extent to which \nthe program-based approach succeeds may depend as much on \nincentives, leadership,  or  the  quality of personal relationships \nwithin  the  system  as  on  the  formal  structures  or  mechanisms \nthat seek to hold the broader program together.  \n\nl.   Harmonization, Coordination, and Partnership   \n\nThe  Cook  Islands  harmonization  story  tells  how  government \ncapacity  (mainly  the  Aid  Management  Division  [AMD])  was \nenhanced  to  support  harmonization  and  alignment  with  New \nZealand and Australia. As indicated in Box 5, the agreements \nsigned by the three parties had five primary objectives. While the \nCook Islands\u2019 harmonization objectives were not explicit on the \n\nBox 5:   Cook Islands Harmonization objectives\n\n \u0083\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\nReduce workloads of all parties involved. \nRefine each government\u2019s focus within the aid management \ndelivery process.\nRecognize and implement the aligning of donor policies \nwith Cook Islands\u2019 development priorities.\nContribute to efficiency gains in policy consultation, and \nincrease the scale and flexibility with a larger program.\nIncrease resources and access to a wider (and more relevant) \nrange of technical assistance.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  75\n\n\fissue of capacity, it was anticipated that harmonization would \nhave positive capacity impacts, including reducing demands on \nthe Government\u2019s administrative capacity and helping to make \nmore efficient use of existing capacity. In fact, the case study \nshows that demands on government capacity increased in the \nearly days, which was partly what drove the AMD to push for \nincreased staffing to address the new harmonization agenda.\n\nUnder the harmonization arrangement, the assistance programs \nwere aligned with national priorities, and both donors adhered \nto  the  Government\u2019s  tendering,  contracting,  and  procurement \narrangements. However, the case study suggests that the partners \nmay have entered into the agreement with different assumptions \nabout  collaboration  and  alignment  of  systems.  As  the  author \ncommented:  \u201cThe  environment  at  the  time  was  flavored  by \ndonor  concerns  about\u2026their  own  reporting  obligations  and \naccountabilities to their agencies and parliaments.\u201d [ 78 ] Ultimately, \nthis  meant  that  introducing  the  new  initiative  as  a  pilot  was \na  good  idea  because  it  allowed  the  parties  to  learn  from  the \nexperience and adapt over time. \n\nFrom a capacity perspective, the aid harmonization pilot provided \nthe impetus for the Government and, in particular, the AMD to \ninnovate and to gain the knowledge and wherewithal to \u201cturn \nthings around in an agency that had been reactive rather than \nproactive, and to enhance its capacity so that it could take on \na  leadership  role  in  aid  management  and  coordination  issues \nin the country.\u201d [ 79 ] The case concludes: \u201cIn the process, AMD\u2019s \ncapacity to lead reforms in the area of development cooperation \nhas  been  enhanced.  Whether  they  can  be  sustained  will  be  a \nstory for another day.\u201d [ 80 ]\n\nThe  AusAID-funded  Fiji  health  sector  improvement  program \n(FHSIP)  (not  one  of  the  cases  for  this  study)  highlights  the \npotential for different ways of collaborating with developing-\ncountry partners under AusAID\u2019s partnering arrangement. The \nexpectation articulated in FHSIP\u2019s request for tender (RFT) was \nthat the program would be developed following the Ministry of \nHealth (MoH) plans and relying on MoH leadership. As stated \nin  the  RFT:  \u201cAs  far  as  possible,  the  structure  and  function  of \n\n78  Wichman 2007. p. 15.\n79  Wichman 2007. p. 15.\n80  Wichman 2007. p. 15. \n\n 76 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fProgram arrangements will follow the Fiji management structures \nand organizational relationships\u201d. [ 81 ] Consistent with this intent, \nthe current program director is a Fijian who was selected jointly \nby the various program partners and who is permanently based \nin  the  MoH  head  office.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the \nPacific Aid Effectiveness Principles, specifically a call for \u201cuse \nof local systems\u201d and reliance on TA that \u201censures that capacity \nis built with tangible benefits to the country to support national \nownership.\u201d \n\nThe  Kiribati  water  and  sanitation  case  offers  an  example  of \ncountry-level cooperation and its potential for harnessing the \ncapacity of actors with shared interests. The case study describes \nhow  various  water,  waste  management,  and  community \ndevelopment projects worked closely together, eventually forming \nthe Kiribati Te Boboto (Make Kiribati Beautiful) Coalition: \u201cThe \ncombined  efforts  of  these  various  projects  have  contributed \nto  building  the  capacity  of  individuals  and  households  to \nbetter understand and manage their wastes\u2026.The result of the \ncombined  efforts  has  (also)  been  very  visible  in  the  general \ncleanliness  of  South  Tarawa  and  the  virtual  disappearance  of \nrecyclable  cans.\u201d [ 82 ]  One  of  the  local  stakeholders  noted  that: \n\u201cCDSP (the ADB-funded intervention) was very good at being \nopen to working with others in the community working in the \nsame issues area. Many projects can be insular, protecting their \nown turf, but the monthly meetings of the stakeholders provided \na good place for wider input (which) resulted in a much greater \ncollective output than otherwise.\u201d [ 83 ]\n\nVarious  capacity  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  the  preceding \nexamples.

Political economy Considerations\n\nFor some analysts, political economy considerations are central \nto explaining the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of development \ninterventions  in  low-income  countries.  Political  economy \nfactors  include  social  and  political  structures  and  behaviors, \nsuch  as  clientelism,  patronage,  and  \u201dstate  capture\u201d  by  local \nelites.  These  practices  are  often  deeply  entrenched  and  can \nseriously circumscribe reform efforts or attempts to develop or \nuse capacity. Political economy considerations were a factor to \nvarying  degrees  in  the  case  studies  prepared  for  this  broader \nstudy,  such  as  clientelism  and  the  wantok  system [ 84 ]  in  PNG, \nfaaSamoa (Samoan culture and way of seeing the world), and \nthe matai system, which is Samoa\u2019s political tradition whereby \npolitical leadership is vested in community elders.  \n\nAs  the  preceding  description  suggests,  political  economy \nconsiderations  are  often  linked  to  traditional  power  systems \nor attempts to adapt them in a \u201dmodern\u201d context. As Turnbull \nnotes: \n\n\u201cIt  is  not  the  structure  of  the  state  that  is  the  main \nimpediment preventing it (from) improving the living \nstandards  of  ordinary  Solomon  Islanders.  It  is  the \nway  that  practices  based  on  the  power  relationships \nand  means  of  social  control  practiced  in  traditional \nsocieties  pervade  the  state  today.  Solutions  need  to \nbe found to several problems. There needs to be ways \nof 1. avoiding the unchecked self-interest within the \nstate at all levels; 2. reducing the time and energy that \nindividuals spend on ensuring their political survival \nrather than on implementing policies for development; \nand 3. establishing a pattern of long-term cooperation \nbetween  the  state  and  various  communities  so  that \nthey can work towards mutual development\u201d. [ 85 ]\n\nPartly  because  many  Pacific  island  states  are  still  relatively \nyoung, they are faced with the challenge of managing tensions \nbetween  modern  state  institutions  and  traditional  customs \nand  institutional  arrangements\u2014the  latter  frequently  having \n\n84  Wantok literally means \u201done language\u201d in pidgin, but more generally refers to the set of \n\ntraditional customs and obligations associated with being a member of a social group.\n\n85  Turnbull 2002. p. 200.\n\n 78 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fgreater  legitimacy  and  influence.  As  suggested  in  a  number \nof  the  cases,  this  has  implications  for  the  functioning  of  the \nstate in these countries and efforts to strengthen their capacity. \nIt  also  underlines,  once  again,  the  importance  of  investing  in \nunderstanding  the  context  before  engaging  in  CD  processes. \nThis  includes  understanding  traditional  culture  and  informal \npower arrangements, as well as their relationship to more formal \nstructures and processes in society.    \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Challenges in the \nPacific \u2013 what is Different?\n\nBefore  focusing  on  what  is  different  about  the  Pacific,  it  is \nworth acknowledging the capacity challenges that Pacific island \nstates  share  with  other  developing  countries.  These  include \nweak  institutions,  uneven  policies,  and  limited  availability  of \nhighly  skilled  and  economically  productive  human  resources. \nCollectively, these are represented in the largest, outer portion \nof the diagram below (Figure 2). \n\nFigure 2: Capacity Issues: universal to Pacific-specific\n\nPacific-specific \nCapacity Issues  \n\nCapacity Issues \nSpecific to Small Island \nDeveloping States \n\nCapacity Issues Generally \nAffecting Developing \nCountries \n\nAside from these shared challenges that are, more or less, common \nto developing countries at large,  are the particular challenges \nusually associated with small island developing states:   \n\n\u2022\t\n\nsmall populations, with correspondingly limited skills \nbase and specialized expertise,\n\n\u2022\t\n\ngeographic isolation,\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  79\n\n\f\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\npoor access to markets,\n\nlimited economic diversification, \n\ndis-economies of scale,\n\nvulnerability (economically, environmentally, \nculturally), \n\nloss of capacity through emigration, and\n\nlimited capacity to be represented effectively in \nglobal forums.\n\nAt the next level are those challenges unique to, or present to a \ngreater extent in, Pacific island states. These include\n\ngaps in capacity in strategically important areas, \nwhich contribute to vulnerability and dependency;\n\nrelatively young states, frequently struggling with \nissues of legitimacy;\n\nongoing tensions between modern and traditional \ninstitutions;\n\ninternal divisions (including active conflicts) that \ndiminish capacity, discourage citizens, and undermine \nstate institutions;\n\nlimited broad-based consensus on national priorities;\n\nlimited capacity for effective demand, or to hold \ngovernments accountable\u2014strong leaders are often \nunchecked in the absence of a sizeable and capable \nmiddle class; \n\nlimited capacity for effective regional collaboration;\n\nsignificant aid dependency, coupled with limited \ncapacity to manage it effectively; and\n\nchallenges of leaders juggling multiple \nresponsibilities. \n\nThe cases also highlight various features of Pacific island states \nthat could be described as \u201dcapacity positive\u201d:\n\nstrong social capital, including legitimacy of \ntraditional institutions that can play an effective role \nin development or use of local capacity, if supported \nproperly;\n\n 80 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\f\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nsmall communities and local organizations that can \nbe mobilized relatively quickly for change processes \nif effective leadership is in place; and\n\nsystems of engagement for the common good (such \nas the wantok system). \n\nThe smaller shapes within the Pacific-specific oblong in Figure \n2  represent  the  diversity  of  the  region  and  are  included  to \nunderline the fact that capacity challenges vary depending on \nwhether one is referring to an isolated micro state, a medium-\nsize  island  state  with  higher  level  of  economic  diversity  and \nstrong institutions, or a state with weak institutions emerging \nfrom conflict. Capacity challenges are also situation-specific; \nthe challenges facing Cook Islanders 10 years ago, for example, \nmay  be  quite  different  from  the  ones  they  are  dealing  with \ntoday. Similarly, the challenges facing residents of the capital \nisland,  Rarotonga,  are  quite  likely  to  be  different  than  those \nfacing residents of the outer islands. \n\nFurther,  on  the  issue  of  Pacific  capacity  challenges,  a  2004 \nADB-funded review of governance in the Pacific suggested that \n\u201cinadequate capacity building, coupled with the loss of senior \nstaff who have management and technical skills, is common in \nmany PDMCs.\u201d [ 86 ] This failure to train and retain many of the \nmost skilled people was seen as \u201ca long-standing contributor \nto concerns over the quality of governance and institutions,\u201d [ 87 ]\nparticularly  in  Polynesia,  but  increasingly  in  other  countries \nin the region. \n\nWhile not a uniquely Pacific concern, ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy \nalso notes that \u201ctoo often, capacity building (in the region) has \nbeen related to the objectives of the project rather than to those \nof the host organization, or capacity building requirements have \nbeen insufficiently analyzed, planned, or coordinated.\u201d [ 88 ]\n\nDespite these challenges, there are, as identified in the case \nstudies  included  in  this  review,  examples  of  successful  CD \nin central Government departments, state-owned enterprises, \nand civil society groups in the region. The challenge flowing \nfrom this is to understand better the relevant success factors, \n\n ADB 2004a. \n86 \n87  See footnote 2.\n88  ADB 2005a. \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  81\n\n\fparticularly  those  especially  applicable  in  the  Pacific, \nwhether  strong  leadership,  effective  engagement  of  citizens \nand  nonstate  actors,  organizational  legitimacy,  or  social \nstability.\n\na.   Country-specific Issues\n\nWhile  people  often  talk  in  general  terms  about  the  \u201dPacific \nregion,\u201d  the  region,  as  the  diagram  and  text  above  suggest, \nrepresents  a  multitude  of  cultural,  environmental,  political, \nand social conditions. Many countries in the region do share \ncommon cultural characteristics, even histories, but each is also \nunique  in  various  respects\u2014size,  the  nature  of  the  economy, \nsocial  institutions,  and  governance  arrangements.  The  Cook \nIslands,  for  example,  operates  under  a  \u201cfree  association\u201d \narrangement  negotiated  with  New  Zealand  in  1965.  Under \nthis  special  relationship,  Cook  Islanders  hold  New  Zealand \ncitizenship and are able to travel freely to New Zealand. The \nlevels of migration fluctuate over time, but during periods of \neconomic downturn on the islands, rates tend to increase. \u201cIn \n1974, for example, when the international airport opened on \nthe main island of Rarotonga, an exodus of over 5,000 people \nwas recorded over the next five years. The next major exodus \nwas a result of the economic downturn in 1995\u201396, when over \n1,000  people  left.\u201d [ 89 ]  Given  Cook  Islands  small  population \n(approximately  18,000),  shifts  of  this  magnitude  can  have  a \nsignificant impact on the country, including loss of important \nskills. \n\nThe  RMI  is  a  sovereign  nation  linked  to  the  United  States \n(US)  through  a  Compact  of  Free  Association  that  entered \ninto  force  on  21  October  1986.  Under  the  arrangement,  the \nUS  is  responsible  for  RMI\u2019s  security  and  defense.  The  US  is \nalso  obliged  to  provide  the  RMI  at  least  US$57  million  per \nyear until 2023, including contributions to a jointly managed \ntrust  fund.  This  relationship  is  important  to  RMI  in  terms \nof  the  revenues  it  brings  in;  it  also  influences  decisions  on \ndevelopment investments in the country and affects the flow \nof human capacity out of the country. \n\n 82 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n89 Wichman 2007. p. 12.\n\n\fTuvalu  is  the  fourth  smallest  country  in  the  world,  with  an \nestimated population in 2005 of 10,440. As noted in the case \nstudy on the trust fund, Tuvalu is a \u201csmall, isolated, resource-\npoor country made up of nine low lying coral atolls about two \nhours flying time north of Fiji. \u2026. Having virtually no physical \nexports, the main sources of foreign exchange generated locally \nare royalties from distant-water fishing nations for access to \nTuvalu\u2019s exclusive economic zone and remittances sent home \nby  maritime  workers  on  foreign  merchant  vessels.  The  once \nflourishing philatelic bureau revenue has dwindled to almost \nnothing.  International  development  assistance  from  bilateral \nand  multilateral  sources  supports  the  standard  of  living  by \nproviding  essential  infrastructure,  operational  supplies,  and \ntechnical assistance.\u201d [ 90 ] The country also has a chronic budget \ndeficit and has minimal infrastructure left over from colonial \ndays. These were among the challenges that led the Government \nto pursue the idea of a trust fund as an alternative mechanism \nfor  development,  with  the  objective  that  it  would  increase \neconomic self reliance. \n\nPNG  is  the  largest  PDMC,  with  a  population  of  just  under \n6  million  spread  across  18  provinces.  The  country  is \nincredibly  diverse  geographically  and  culturally;  it  is  home \nto approximately 800 different language groups (more than a \nquarter of the languages in the world). PNG also has significant \nresource wealth, although it has struggled to use that wealth \neffectively for broad-based development. The country has been \nindependent since 1976 but has a significant ongoing bilateral \nrelationship  with  Australia,  including  a  large  development \nassistance program. Governance and security issues continue \nto plague the country and serve as a brake on development.\n\nAs important as the geographic and environmental characteristics \nof Pacific island countries is their culture and how it defines \nthe uniqueness of each country and the communities therein. \nTraditions  relating  to  decision  making,  power  sharing,  and \nrole  of  women  are  often  deeply  rooted  and  can  significantly \ninfluence  domestic  change  processes,  including  those  aimed \nat  developing  domestic  capacity.  All  of  these  are  reasons  to \nlook  beyond  the  capacity  characteristics  of  the  region  to  the \nparticulars  of  the  individual  country  or  community  when \n\n90 Bell 2007. p. 3.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  83\n\n\fcontemplating investments in change processes.

This table, while incomplete, reflects the \nresults of that exercise.\n\nb.  Capacity Challenges of Fragile or Post-conflict States \n\nMost of the approaches to CD described in this report would be \napplicable in most developing countries. However, fragile, weakly \nperforming  and  post-conflict  states  face  additional  capacity \nchallenges. Furthermore, those challenges vary by fragile state, \nwhether  the  country  is  in  decline,  emerging  from  conflict,  or \nchronically weak. Post-conflict states, in particular, are usually \nunder  pressure  to  quickly  restore  security,  services,  and  state \ninstitutions at a time when capacity is weak and infrastructure \nmay have been destroyed, while public institutions are barely \nfunctioning, are without staff, and may lack legitimacy in the \neyes of citizens.   \n\nThe ADB\u2019s April 2007 report on weakly performing countries [ 91 ]\noutlines  key  points  about  operating  in  weakly  performing \ncountries. It suggests  that  no  single  or standardized approach \napplies and that it is important to \u201cre-examine local conditions \nto find ways to work effectively.\u201d That entails, in part, ensuring \na clear understanding of the reasons for the fragility of the state. \nIn conflict, or post-conflict situations, this includes gaining an \nunderstanding  of  the  reasons  for  the  conflict.  However,  as  a \n\n91 ADB 2007a.\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  85\n\n\frecent AusAID report on Timor-Leste indicated, \u201csome advisors \nappear to be conflict blind \u2026. waiting for things to \u2018return to \nnormal,\u2019\u201d [ 92 ] which leads to the suggestion that conflict analysis \nneed be undertaken to ensure that interventions avoid a \u201dbusiness \nas usual\u201d approach. \n\nDerick  Brinkerhoff [ 93 ]  has  identified  four  scenarios,  shown  in \nFigure 3 below, that can help to frame thinking about capacity \nissues  in  fragile  states  and  how  to  engage  governments  on \nreforms: \n\nFigure 3:   Fragile States: Capacity and willingness\n\nwillingness\n\nWeak\n\nStrong\n\nWeak\n\nAt risk or failed\n\nWeak but willing\n\ny\nt\ni\nc\na\np\na\nC\n\nStrong\n\nStrong but \nunresponsive\n\nGood performer\n\nSource: Brinkerhoff, adapted from Department for International Development (DFID). 2006.

[ 94 ]\n\nAs  Brinkerhoff  notes,  all  but  the  \u201cgood  performers\u201d  in  Figure \n3 are considered fragile states, either because of weak capacity \nor  weak  willingness,  or  both.  Brinkerhoff  cautions,  however, \nthat fragile states are not static; they evolve and shift over time \ndepending on a myriad of factors that can influence the capacity \nof the state and the commitment of key stakeholders to reforms. \nThe two conflict-related cases reviewed for this study\u2014Solomon \nIslands and Timor-Leste\u2014can probably be described as having \nweak capacity and weak to strong willingness or commitment. \n\nThe case study on Solomon Islands\u2019 Ministry of Infrastructure \nDevelopment (MID) describes how MID went through a significant \nchange process, with ADB support, following the conflict in that \ncountry. Solomon Islands was at the time of the project in an \n\n92 \n93 \n94 \n\n AusAID 2007. p. 8.\n Brinkerhoff 2007. \n Brinkerhoff 2007. p. 1.

TA \nprovided by ADB sought to help MID develop new policies and \nprocedures to support infrastructure development in the country, \nessentially shifting the ministry\u2019s role from being a provider of \nservices to a regulator. The project evaluation noted successes in \nsome but not all areas, in part due to the weakness of government \ninstitutions and miscalculations as to what could be achieved in \nlight of prevailing circumstances and the relatively short time \nframe for the project. It was not apparent from the case the extent \nto which the TA design was informed by an understanding of \nthe dynamics of the conflict, or thinking about how to address \ncapacity issues in the early stages following a conflict. \n\nThe Timor-Leste case describes UNDP support to the Government \nto strengthen its capacity during the post-conflict transition. The \nsupport was broad-based, using a three-pillar model: skills and \nknowledge, systems and processes, and attitudes and behaviors \n(Figure  4).  In  support  of  these  three  pillars,  advisors  offered \nsupport in training, policy, legislative frameworks, development \nof manuals, and strengthening of operating systems.\n\nFigure 4:   Spheres of Advisors\u2019 Accomplishments in Capacity Development\n\nSPHeReS oF ADVISoR\u2019S ACCoMPlISHMentS\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\nOn the job\nStructured courses (in-house)\nTraining of trainers\nProfessional or formal training\n\ntraining\n\nlegislative \nFrameworks\n\nPolicy \nFrameworks\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nAssistance \nwith policy \nframeworks in \nall areas\nFrameworks \nthat allow \nfor coherent \nplanning\nAnual Action \nPlans and SIPS\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nAssistance with \ndevelopment \nof primary and \nsupplementary \nlegislation for \nState institutions\nHelping to ensure \ncoordination of \nlegislative process\nProvision of \nregular legal \nadvice to senior \nTimorese managers\n\noperating\nSystems\n\nManuals\n\n\u2022\t\n\nInternal operating systems \nhave helped to establish \nStandard Operating \nProcedures for many key tasks\n\n\u2022\t\n\nManuals/guidelines \ncovering training, \nprocedural and ethical \nmatters\n\nSource: Civilian Support Group - CSG and UNDP\n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  87\n\n\fThe intervention was seen as a success because of the application \nof \u201ccomplementary policy and capacity building interventions\u201d, \nincluding\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\npreparation of a national poverty assessment report \n(which provided necessary statistical data and \nbaseline information),\n\nhuman resources needs assessment,\n\nestablishment of capacity development coordination \nunit,\n\ncompletion of first national development plan, and\n\ndevelopment of a capacity development program for \nthe National Planning and Development Agency. [ 95 ]   \n\nProcess factors contributing to success included a learning-by-\ndoing  approach,  responsiveness  of  the  project,  participatory \nplanning processes, and being complementary to other initiatives, \nwhich helped to foster a climate of trust and collaboration.\n\nUNDP concluded that the three-pillar model was a \u201cgood model\u201d, \nbut  that  it  focused  too  much  on  skills  and  knowledge  (at  the \nexpense of systems issues), and that there was a need to \u201cbetter \ncapture local realities and dynamics.\u201d UNDP also saw the advisor \nmodel as being of \u201cdoubtful\u201d effectiveness, given the limitations \nof  a  one-to-one  approach,  and  felt  that  use  of  nonresident \ncoaches and mentors had been overlooked in favor of resident \nassignments. [ 96 ]\n\n4.   Monitoring and evaluation of \nCapacity Development\n\na.   what is being Measured?\n\nMonitoring and evaluation (M&E) in most of the cases did not \nhave an explicit focus on capacity issues. This is not inconsistent \nwith  findings  in  other  CD  studies,  which  have  found  that,  by \nand large, M&E of development projects and programs tend to \nfocus on changes in performance (primarily output and outcome \n\n95  Based on brief paper entitled Planning for a Society in Transition: Creating Institutions and \n\nBuilding Capacity (Timor-Leste) (case study is incomplete).\n AusAID 2007. p. 14\u201315. \n\n96 \n\n 88 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\flevel). There are various reasons  for  this: changes in capacity \nare often difficult to measure, especially soft capacities, such as \nleadership, or the collective capacity of multiple organizations \nworking together. It is also difficult to measure change in capacity \nsystems  (as  compared  to  individual  or  organizational-level \nchange). Furthermore, donor incentive systems and monitoring \nframeworks  are  still  geared  predominantly  toward  measuring \nand being accountable for \u201dperformance results.\u201d \n\nThere are several exceptions in the cases studied. In the Cook \nIslands  harmonization  case,  the  M&E  framework  focused,  in \npart, on the capacity of the AMD. The participatory monitoring \nand  evaluation  surveys  referred  to  in  the  Tuvalu  trust  fund \ncase included awareness and participation in decision-making \nprocesses,  which  can  be  considered  measures  of  community \nempowerment or capacity.  \n\nThe  PNG  TA  facilities  and  the  PPII,  given  their  mandate  and \norientation, have taken a more focused approach to monitoring \ncapacity changes. They also  rely  on  different approaches. For \nexample, monitoring of the Capacity Building Service Centre\u2019s \nmanaging contractor in PNG\u2019s health sector emphasizes \u201dquality \nof inputs,\u201d as opposed to outputs realized. This is due to several \nfactors: the clear emphasis on capacity building in the advisor\u2019s \nrole, recognition by AusAID and the managing contractor of the \nimportance of quality of inputs and the nature of the advisor \nengagement  vis  \u00e0  vis  realization  of  capacity  objectives,  and \nrecognition that many factors (often beyond the control of the \nadvisor) are likely to affect outputs or outcomes. \n\nSimilarly,  under  the  AusAID-funded  Fiji  health  sector \nimprovement program (FHSIP), long-term advisors are subject to \nannual performance assessments that measure progress against \ntheir capacity building plans, their work plans, and performance \ncompetencies. The last mentioned includes such considerations \nas ability to share ideas and information with others, ability to \nadjust capacity-building plans, and appropriateness of behavior. \nThe  performance  assessment  process  is  based  on  feedback \nfrom  the  advisor,  his  or  her  counterpart,  the  FHSIP  program \ndirector, and/or a representative from the Australian managing \ncontractor.  \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  89\n\n\fIn  the  PPII,  participants  are  monitoring  capacity  results  (it  is \ntoo  early  to  demonstrate  results  in  service  delivery  or  sector \nperformance).  Capacity  changes  being  measured  include \nthe  extent  to  which  initiatives  have  strengthened  provincial \nmanagement, budget, and human resource systems; coordination \nbetween provinces and districts; and links between the national \nand provincial governments.      \n\nIncreasing attention is being given to monitoring capacity, given \nits stated centrality as a development priority. [ 97 ] This includes \nexploring ways of assessing changes in hard and soft capacities, \nand relying on more qualitative measures, including those that \ncan incorporate intermediate capacity changes while not losing \nsight  of  longer-term  capacity  results.  Part  of  the  challenge  is \nin reconciling long-term capacity interests with donors\u2019 usual \ncommitment to \u201dobjectively verifiable indicators\u201d of change in \ntime frames of 4\u20135 years or less. Despite recent experimentation \nand increased attention to M&E of capacity, as in the initiatives \nabove, it remains a work in progress. \n\nb.   who is Measuring? For what Purpose?\n\nAs with other projects covered in the case studies, the Kiribati water \nand  sanitation  case  noted  how  the  government  implementing \nagency for the TA project had no formal mechanism to assess \nthe TA, including its impact. This led the case authors to suggest \nthat too often there is an over-dependence on donors for M&E \nof projects.\n\nThis is consistent with findings from other reviews, which have \ncharacterized  M&E  as  a  largely  extractive  process,  with  data \nmainly being mined by donors for their accountability purposes \nwith modest engagement by local stakeholders. The exceptions, \nonce  again,  appear  to  be  the  PNG  TA  facilities  and  the  PPII, \nwhich  have  encouraged  PNG  leadership  in  defining  capacity \nobjectives and measuring corresponding results. \n\nc.   Are there lessons and Are they being learned? \n\nFrom the observations above, it would be safe to conclude that, \nwith several exceptions, the cases studied yielded few examples of \n\n 90 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n97 See, for example, Engel, Land, and Keizer 2006. \n\n\fsystematic learning about CD through formal M&E frameworks. \nThis means limited systematic learning about design processes \nfor CD interventions, about implementation strategies, or about \nthe  effectiveness  of  advisors  in  contributing  to  sustainable \nchanges in PDMC capacity.  \n  \nNevertheless,  the  more  \u201dsuccessful\u201d  projects  among  the  cases \nreviewed  had  an  above-average  ability  to  learn  and  adapt  as \nthey proceeded. This adaptive capacity [ 98 ] is seen as an important \ncharacteristic  of  vibrant,  well  functioning  organizations  or \nsystems  and  includes  the  ability  to  learn  from  experience, \nreflect, and shift directions in response to learning or changing \nconditions in the programming context. The challenge is how \nto  foster  that  capacity  and  use  it  to  improve  analysis  and \nunderstanding of CD processes.  \n\n98\n\nSee Sorgenfrei and Wrigley (2005) for more on the concept of adaptive capacity. \n\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  91\n\n\fwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\nwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n 92 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fIV.\n\nConCluSIonS  \u2013 \nKey tHeMeS\n\nBased on the study findings, four main themes appear to be key \nto advancing the CD agenda within ADB\u2019s Pacific department: \nthe  importance  of  context  and  capacity  systems,  thinking \nstrategically  about  capacity,  programming  strategically  for \nsustainable  capacity,  and  learning  from  experience.  These  are \ndiscussed below.\n\nA.   the Importance of Context \nand Capacity Systems\n\nOne  theme  reflected  in  the  case  studies,  and  a  constant  in \nthe  literature  on  CD,  is  the  importance  of  the  programming \ncontext  in  influencing  opportunities  for  and  the  shape  of  CD \nprocesses. The \u201dstronger\u201d projects in this study were those that \nunderstood  the  context,  either  through  extensive  consultative \nand participatory processes, by building on locally articulated \npolicies or priorities, or by relying on advisors who had a solid \nunderstanding  of  the  local  context.  As  Simon  Tiller,  the  lead \nconsultant on the ADB-sponsored RMI fisheries project noted: \u201cIt \nis absolutely imperative to get under the skin of the environment \nyou are working in. That was happening towards the end of the \nfirst TA and it was a major part of why we were able to move so \nquickly with the second TA.\u201d [ 99 ] Case writer Ben Graham noted \nthat before arriving  at  a key  turning point in the project, the \nlead consultant: \u201chad not yet fully recognized the less obvious \ninformal  decision-making  processes  that  exist  beneath  the \nmore  formal  government  processes  and  procedures.  As  Tiller \ncommented, these connections  \u2019were not on any organization \n\n99 Graham 2007a, p. 5.\n\nConclusions  \u2013 Key Themes  93\n\n\fchart.\u2019 Tiller added, \u2018For the first time I felt we were partners and \nfrom that point on we began to make real progress.\u2019\u201d [ 100 ]\n\nWith Tuvalu\u2019s Falekaupule trust fund, stakeholders made a clear \ndecision to proceed \u201cfrom an understanding of what works at \nthe island level (and) develop processes that build on traditions \nand integrate these into internationally recognized development \nprocesses.\u201d [  101  ]  This  example  highlights,  as  do  others,  the \nimportance of understanding local traditions and culture as well \nas power dynamics and informal relationships. \n\nAside  from  the  fairly  local  contexts  above  are  the  national \ncontexts in the Pacific discussed earlier. Each includes factors \nthat  influence,  one  way  or  the  other,  attempts  to  strengthen \nor utilize capacity. The Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste case \nstudies,  for  example,  highlight  the  significant  effect  of  the \nconflicts  in  those  countries  on  efforts  to  restore  or  otherwise \naddress capacity concerns. Other projects reviewed point to the \ninfluence of political economy or sociocultural issues, the wantok \nsystem in PNG, or the role of the kingdoms in Polynesia. \n \nPolitical, economic, aid, and associational links among PDMCs \nand  with  larger  regional  countries,  can  also  be  important \ncontextual factors, such as the Cook Islands historical link with \nNew Zealand, RMI\u2019s free association arrangement with the US, \nPNG\u2019s sizeable development assistance program with Australia, \nand the various regional arrangements that link Pacific island \ncountries.  In  addition,  new  donors,  particularly  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  and  Taipei,China,    are  influencing  parts  of \nthe region and have begun to influence the overall landscape of \nexternal assistance and approaches to \u201ddevelopment\u201d activities.\n\nThus,  mechanisms  are  needed  for  external  stakeholders,  in \nparticular, to develop a solid understanding of the programming \ncontext (regional, national, and local), including capacity issues \ntherein, before programming decisions are made. Several reviews \nhave noted this as an area where ADB could be strengthened, \nincluding recommendations for \u201cmore joint analytical work\u201d and \n\u201cpolitical economy analysis.\u201d [ 102 ] The emphasis in the analysis \nis  likely  to  vary  by  circumstance  but,  based  on  prominent \nissues  in  this  review,  would  probably  include  institutional, \n\n100   Graham 2007a, p. 5.\n101   Bell 2007, p. 3.\n102   See, for example, ADB 2007a. \n\n 94 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fpolicy,  political,  or  security  issues;  stakeholder  relationships; \ninterorganizational  issues;  organizational  culture;  leadership; \ntechnical and managerial capacity; incentives; informal rules; \nlegitimacy; and demand-side capacity. \n\nMechanisms  or  processes  likely  to  be  effective  in  that  respect \ninclude\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\nlocally-based, participatory consultative processes;\nsurveys;\ncontextual analyses;\ncapacity mapping;\ninstitutional assessments;\nSWOT  (strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and \nthreats) analyses;\nstakeholder analysis;\nsector assessments;\ncapacity and vulnerability analyses; and\npolicy environment mapping.\n\nB.  thinking Strategically about Capacity \n\nOnce  a  reasonably  clear  understanding  of  the  programming \ncontext has been established, the next step is to think strategically \nabout  capacity  opportunities  and  constraints  in  that  context. \nThe  findings  from  the  case  studies  and  other  reviews  offer \nsome  guidance  on  this.  First  is  the  importance  of  thinking  in \nterms  of  capacity  systems,  specifically  ensuring  that  analyses \nand programming strategies are based on an understanding of \nthe dynamics of the broader capacity system and relationships \nwithin it. \n\nThe conceptual framework in Figure 5 offers a way of thinking \nabout the relationships among the different capacity levels. [ 103 ]\nThe framework suggests that the various levels are linked, and \nthat  changes  planned  in  one  level  are  likely  to  be  influenced \nby factors in other parts of the system. For example, efforts to \nenhance organizational capacity or performance are likely to be \nshaped as much by forces in the enabling environment (such as \nlaws, regulations, attitudes,  and values)  as by factors internal \nto  the  organization,  (skills,  systems,  leadership,  relationships, \n\n103   This framework is a variation of the ADB framework shown earlier in this report. Among other \n\nthings, it adds reference to individuals and the enabling environment.\n\nConclusions  \u2013 Key Themes  95\n\n\fetc.).  Similarly,  the  success  of  a  training  program  is  likely \nto  be  contingent  as  much  on  conditions  in  the  participating \norganization\u2014such  as  incentives,  supportive  management,  or \nfinances\u2014as the quality of the training inputs. \n\nFigure 5: Conceptual Framework: Capacity levels \n\nenabling environment\n\nPublic Sector \nInstitutional Context\n\nSector / network\n\norganization, group\n\noRg1\n\nIndividual\n\noRg4\n\noRg3\n\noRg2\n\nZoom In\n\nZoom out\n\nThe small lines in Figure 5 represent the links between the various \ncapacity dimensions or levels. The larger arrows underline the \nimportance of \u201dzooming in and out,\u201d to use UNDP\u2019s language, in \nthe analysis of the capacity challenge and in the search for possible \nsolutions. By zooming in and out, planners and practitioners are \nable  to  assess  opportunities  and  constraints  at  various  levels, \ntheir potential impact on one another, and determine the most \nappropriate level(s) or type(s) of intervention. \n\nInterventions, for example, may zoom in on an organizational \nchange process, or alternately seek to address an issue(s) across \nseveral levels. Decisions about specific programming interventions \nare likely to be based on several variables, including the nature \nof the development problem, existing programs, current capacity \nstrengths or weaknesses in the various levels, and opportunities \n\n 96 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\for inhibitors in the enabling environment. In sum, the framework \ncalls  for  systematic  analysis  of  opportunities  and  constraints, \nidentification  of  windows  of  opportunity,  strategic  entry \npoints, and promotion of integrated responses. This perspective \nrepresents, arguably, the most important contribution of CD\u2014a \nsystematic  recognition  of  the  importance  of  thinking  about \nindividuals, organizations, programs, and policies as part of a \ngreater whole.\n\nIt  is  important  to  note,  as  does  the  World  Bank\u2019s  study  on \neffective states and engaged societies [ 104 ], that interventions that \nare \u201csystemic\u201d do not necessarily need to be comprehensive in \nscope. In fact, the scope and timing of an intervention should \nbe  sensitive  to  the  absorptive  capacity  of  local  partners  and \ntheir readiness to implement change. This may lead to \u201cstrategic \nincrementalism\u201d which itself needs to be built on an understanding \nof the dynamics of the capacity system and a sense of how inputs \nmight be sequenced to maximize effectiveness.  \n\nTable  1  highlights  specific  capacity  issues  to  consider  in  the \nvarious levels of the CD framework in Figure 5.\n\ntable 1: Strategic Capacity-related Issues to Consider\n\nEnabling \nEnvironment \n\nPublic Sector \nInstitutional \nContext \n\nCapacity-related Issues (a sampling) \n\n \u0083\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n \u0083\n \u0083\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n \u0083\n \u0083\n \u0083\n \u0083\n \u0083\n \u0083\n\nMacroeconomic situation \nGovernment policies, legal and/or \nadministrative environment \nRegulatory environment \nSociocultural environment\nViews of prospective stakeholders \nPolitical will, including historical and \ncontemporary explanations\nPower structures and formal and \ninformal institutions\nIncentives\n\nPoverty reduction strategies and plans\nPublic financial management\nSubnational governance\nAdministrative and legislative reforms\nCivil society participation\nLegitimacy and credibility of state \ninstitutions \n\n104   World Bank, 2005a.

Hard capacities usually refer to \nindividual  or  organizational  competencies,  such  as  financial \nplanning, engineering, or resource management. Soft capacities \ninclude  leadership;  legitimacy;  trust;  and  ability  to  facilitate, \nmotivate,  or  strengthen  identity,  values,  or  a  shared  sense  of \nmission.  Soft  capacities  also  include  the  notion  of  adaptive \ncapacity,  as  well  as  the  capacity  to  collaborate,  network,  or \notherwise strengthen partnerships. Various reviews and analyses \nsuggest that CD efforts often fail, or fall short of expectations, \ndue to a lack of attention to these less tangible, \u201csoft\u201d capacity \nissues. Part of the reason is that it is usually easier to address hard \ncapacities, which are more likely to yield objectively measurable \nresults in the short to medium term. \n\nThe Cook Islands aid coordination case exemplified the importance \nof \u201dsoft\u201d capacities\u2014leadership, diplomacy, and negotiation skills \nto deal with misunderstandings as they arose. These capacities \nwere not necessarily cultivated through the project but already \nexisted to a sufficient extent to allow the initiative to progress \nsuccessfully,  including  dealing  with  hard  capacities,  such  as \nmanagement capability in AMD. The RMI youth services case \nalso underlined the importance of leadership, although in this \n\n 98 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fcase,  it  was  the  lack  of  leadership  that  ultimately  limited  its \nsuccess, despite significant investments in policy development \nand delivery systems.  \n\nThe Nauru case study on its national sustainable development \nstrategy  offered  a  lesson  on  the  issue  of  legitimacy  as  a  soft \ncapacity.  The  case  study  describes  how  limited  trust  and \nconfidence  in  state  institutions  led  to  a  more  purposeful \nengagement of civil society (\u201ca new kind of participation\u201d) to \nensure that the national sustainable development strategy would \nhave legitimacy in the eyes of the public. \n\nA third strategic consideration to take into account at the planning \nstage is the relationship between capacity and performance. The \nEuropean Centre for Development Policy Management study on \ncapacity, change, and performance has addressed this issue. The \nstudy\u2019s interim report highlighted several key issues:\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nThe relationship between capacity and performance \nis complex, particularly given the multitude of \nintervening variables at play within a capacity \nsystem at any point in time.\n\nMost discussions about capacity are really about \nperformance and how to improve it.\n\nShort-term gains in performance are often important \nto sustain momentum in long-term CD programs \nbut can be mistaken for sustainable changes in local \ncapacity.\n\nThere are few incentives or rewards for focusing on \nlong-term capacity in a context where pressures to \nimprove performance are intense. This is particularly \nso in highly destabilized (such as post-conflict) or \npoliticized environments.

Among the exceptions were the TA facilities in PNG, \nwhich have a more clearly defined commitment to capacity\u2014of \nindividuals, organizations, and whole systems\u2014in their mandates. \nA fundamental question for program planners is how they frame \ntheir  investments:  as  long-term  CD  efforts  or  as  initiatives \nthat  seek  primarily  to  increase  performance  over  the  short  to \nmedium term. Or is there a way to support short- to medium-\nterm  performance  improvement  while  also  encouraging,  or  at \nleast not undermining, longer-term capacity interests? \n\nA  fourth  strategic  consideration,  based  on  the  findings  from \nthe  case  studies,  is  the  role  of  the  external  intervener.  CD \nspecialist Peter Morgan has suggested that there are broadly four \n\n 100 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fapproaches to external interventions in development projects; \nthey can be plotted along a continuum as follows: \n\n1) \n\n2) \n\n3) \n\n4) \n\nExternal  interveners  doing  the  work  and  hoping \nthat capacity will be developed through modeling or \nexposure (country systems tend to be bypassed).\nExternal interveners design and control the approach, \nbut  try  to  engage  local  counterparts  through \nconsultation,  participation,  on-the-job  training,  and \nother measures (the \u201ddirect\u201d approach).\nExternal interveners work within developing-country \nprocesses, building on local motivations and facilitating \nchange (accompaniment or the \u201cindirect\u201d approach). \nProviding payments for demonstrated progress (\u201dhands-\noff\u201d approach)  [ 106 ]\n\nThe implication is that the third approach is most consistent with \nCD and aid effectiveness principles, unless PDMCs are positioned \nto benefit from direct financial support without other external \ninputs as per option 4. \n\nA final strategic capacity consideration to address early in any \nCD  initiative  is  the  sustainability  challenge:  how  to  ensure  a \nfocus on what lasts versus  simply \u201dwhat works now.\u201d This is, \nof course, linked to the previous points, including the relative \nemphasis to be placed, and over what period of time, on capacity \nversus performance results. \n\nThe case studies did not yield a great deal of hard evidence on \nthe issue of sustainability, partly because some of the projects \nand  programs  reviewed  were  still  ongoing.  Nevertheless, \nconcerns  were  expressed  in  some  cases  with  respect  to  the \nlikelihood  of  sustaining  results,  whether  they  be  performance \nor capacity results. The Cook Islands public sector reform case, \nfor example, illustrated the challenge of maintaining capacity \nreforms  over  a  decade  with  changing  leadership  and  shifting \ngovernment priorities. This and other similar experiences beg the \nquestion: what combination of inputs and enabling conditions \nis most likely to ensure sustainable capacity results? Expressed \ndifferently, how does one turn a series of capacity transactions, \nand  under  what  types  of  conditions,  into  durable  capacity \ntransformations?\n\n106 Based on correspondence with Peter Morgan.\n\nConclusions  \u2013 Key Themes  101\n\n\fC.  Programming Strategically \nfor Sustainable Capacity \n\nAs  the  preceding  sections  suggest,  the  overall  focus  in  any \nCD  intervention  should  be  on  ensuring  sustainable  changes \nin  capacity.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  recognized  that  there  can \nbe  tensions  to  be  managed  between  the  desire  for  short-term \nresults (on the part of various stakeholders) and the longer-term \nprocess of CD. This is particularly true in fragile states anxious \nto improve services or strengthen the role of state institutions. \nThus, there must be agreement among stakeholders on strategies, \ntime  frames,  and  processes  for  monitoring,  learning,  and \nadjusting approaches. Based on the experiences from the cases \nand CD principles adopted by donor agencies, implementation \nof CD projects and programs should be guided by the following \nconsiderations:\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nLocal  ownership  and  leadership  are  of  paramount \nimportance.\n\nProjects  and  programs  should  build  on  existing \ndeveloping-country capacities, using external resources \nonly when value is clearly added.\n\nParticipatory  approaches  are  necessary  to  reinforce \nownership, ensure legitimacy, and strengthen capacity \nof local stakeholders\u2014follow the local lead.\n\nPriority  should  be  given  to  supporting  developing-\ncountry programs.\n\nThe  primary  role  of  the  external  partner  should  be \nfacilitative and supportive.\n\nDonor  coordination  should  be  encouraged  to  ensure \ncoherent  approaches  and  to  minimize  demands  on \ndeveloping-country partners.\n\nInvestments should be geared to the long term.\n\nExpectations should be realistic, i.e., based on capacity \nassessments and agreed targets.\n\nDonors  should  be  flexible  in  their  approaches  and \nrequirements.\n\n 102 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\f\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nProjects  and  programs  should  rely  on  iterative \napproaches,  ongoing  learning,  and  adaptation; \nthis  implies  less  distinction  between  design  and \nimplementation.\n\nProjects and programs should be managed for results \nand avoid excessive focus on management of inputs.\n\nExpected results should be seen as strategic directions \nthat will change over time as a result of learning. \n\nDecisions also have to be made about the overarching capacity \nstrategy,  which  may  or  may  not  involve  \u201ddevelopment\u201d  of \ncapacity. As mentioned earlier in the report, options include\n\neliminating old or inappropriate capacity,\n\nreducing demand on existing capacity,\n\nmaking better use of existing capacity,\n\nstrengthening existing capacity,\n\nproviding space for innovation or creative use of \ncapacities,\n\ncreating new capacity, or\n\ncreating more enabling conditions for CD or  capacity \nuse.\n\nD.   learning from experience\n\nThe fourth key theme for advancing the CD agenda in PARD is \nlearning. As noted earlier, not a great deal of systematic learning \nfrom experience was noted in the case studies, specifically on the \nissue of CD. This is a reflection of the orientation of the projects; \nonce  again,  the  projects  most  likely  to  yield  capacity  lessons \nare those with a clear focus on CD in their design. The charter \nagreement  for  the  Capacity  Building  Service  Centre  in  PNG, \nfor example, commits all partners to \u201cinnovation, outstanding \nperformance, best practice and dissemination of lessons learned \nto continuously improve the performance of the Service Centre.\u201d \nThe charter also provides for the establishment of a learning and \ninnovation panel, which was intended to, among other things, \n\u201cenable the Service Centre to develop and synthesize knowledge, \nskills, lessons learned, and techniques to continuously improve \ncapacity building within PNG.\u201d \n\n 104 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fAs noted previously, many of the cases reviewed did display a \ncapacity to learn and adapt in response to emerging opportunities \nor changes in the programming environment, but lessons were \nrarely captured in capacity terms. Consistent with the description \nin the last few sections, learning on CD could include\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nanalysis  of  changes  in  the  enabling  environment, \nsuch as policies, institutional rules, and their impact \non  capacity  utilization,  participation  of  citizen  or \ncommunity groups, and awareness raising; \nanalysis  of  organizational  change  processes  to \nassess their impact on strategic leadership capability, \nplanning  or  service  delivery,  financial  management, \nand collaboration;  \ntracking  of  individual  capacity  enhancement  to \ndetermine  effects  on  organizational  capacity  and \nperformance; and\nanalysis  of  incentive  systems  and  their  impact  on \ncapacity strengthening and retention.\n\nEncouraging organizations to focus on monitoring and learning \ncan  be,  in  and  of  itself,  a  valuable  capacity-strengthening \nexercise with potential to contribute to long-term organizational \nwell-being and improved performance.\n\nThe main conclusion on this issue is that if development planners \nand practitioners are to strengthen CD efforts, greater emphasis \nneeds  to  be  placed  on  documenting  experiences  and  lessons, \nsharing them through various means, and incorporating lessons \nin project and program designs. This is discussed further in the \nnext chapter. \n\nConclusions  \u2013 Key Themes  105\n\n\fwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\nwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n\n\fV.\n\nIMPlICAtIonS FoR ADB\n\nThe findings and observations in this report have implications \nfor ADB, bilateral donors, and DMCs in their approach to CD. \nThese implications are addressed in the sections below. \n\nFirst, several projects reviewed for this study have stressed the \nvalue of working from a clear initial understanding of capacity \nissues,  as  well  as  the  social,  economic,  cultural,  and  political \nfactors  that  can  affect  CD  processes.  From  the  perspective  of \nexternal interveners, the \u201csuccesses\u201d reviewed highlight the value \nof highly participatory planning and design processes, as well as \nthe usefulness of looking beyond technical issues in assessment \nprocesses  to  factors  in  the  various  capacity  levels  (including \n\u201csoft\u201d capacities) that could have a bearing on implementation. \nIn  addition,  the  experiences  show  the  value  of  encouraging \n\u201ddemand\u201d  as  one  way  of  ensuring  local  ownership  of  change \nprocesses while enhancing the capacity of citizens to function \neffectively in democratic states. \n\nConsistent  with  this study\u2019s  findings,  ADB\u2019s  first  CD  thematic \nreport  (December  2006)  noted  the  importance  of  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) [ 107 ] to strengthening demand \norientation and effectiveness of CD. It acknowledges that ADB \nis endeavoring to integrate CD into CPS priorities and to take a \nmore strategic approach, but suggests that CD still needs to be \nmainstreamed in sector development. The report also indicates \nthat there is potential to expand capacity assessments and that \nfurther  work  needs  to  be  done  to  mainstream  participatory \napproaches. It also calls for better support for local ownership \nand leadership, better change management processes, and better \ndiagnostics.\n\nSeveral of the cases have underscored the particular challenges \nin  dealing  effectively  with  capacity  issues  in  post-conflict \n\n107  The CPS replaced ADB\u2019s country strategy and program in 2006 to reflect an enhanced emphasis \n\non partnership-based approaches. \n\n \n\n \n\nImplications for ADB  107\n\n\fcountries. At core is the dilemma of how to respond to demands \nfor restoration of peace, security, and government services while \nremaining focused on long-term capacity issues. The conflict-\nrelated cases reviewed in this study, and the broader literature, \nsuggest particular requirements at the planning and design stage \nas highlighted earlier. \n\nThe findings from the various case studies also have implications \nfor capacity programming, including a need to be responsive to \ncontextual factors, to be careful to build on what exists, to pay \nattention to broader systems issues, and to recognize the need \nfor adequate time to progress at an appropriate pace. \n\nAs this study has shown, M&E can be challenging at the best of \ntimes. This is due, in part, to the ambiguous nature of \u201dcapacity\u201d \nand the corresponding difficulty in measuring change in capacity \nover time. It is also challenged by a general tendency to focus \nM&E on performance results as opposed to capacity results.\n\nIn the ADB context, the 2006 CD thematic report notes that only \n21% of ADB-sponsored TA is presently classified as CD, which \nsuggests that 79% of TA is still not monitored or evaluated in \nrelation to its impact on capacity.\n\nSome  of  the  initiatives  reviewed  attempted  to  take  a  more \nsystematic approach to assessing the impact of inputs on domestic \ncapacity. Closer examination of these and similar experiences \nprovides an opportunity for ADB to learn and adopt methods for \nimproving M&E of CD initiatives. [ 108 ] The case studies have also \nprovided an opportunity to consider the incentives for M&E of \nCD, and the relatively limited feedback on this suggests that it \nis strongly driven by donor requirements rather than demands \nof local stakeholders.\n\n108 Starting points for information on monitoring and evaluation of capacity development \ninclude (i) MandE News, http://www.mande.co.uk/ and (ii) Watson, D. 2005.

Of particular note is the work of the capacity \ndevelopment working group (CDWG), which was responsible for \nthe November 2006 document: Integrating Capacity Development \ninto Country Programs and Operations, Proposed Medium-Term \nFramework and Action Plan. [ 109 ] ADB has recently also produced \nvarious reports evaluating TA effectiveness and how to achieve \ndevelopment effectiveness in weakly performing countries.  \n\nThis section draws on those sources, as well as the findings of \nthe Pacific CD study and the results of ADB\u2019s August 2007 Pacific \ncapacity development retreat to offer some thoughts about how \nto move the CD agenda forward in PARD. \n\n1. \n\nInstitutionalizing a CD Approach \nin Country Programs \n\nAccording to the CDWG November 2006 report, \u201c\u2026 there is general \nagreement that in the past sector road maps have been generally \nweak. Road maps are often not based on a good understanding \nof  country  capacities  and  CD  priorities,  and  it  is  not  always \nclear  to  what  extent  ADB\u2019s  program  contributes  to  the  larger \nreform agenda within a sector or theme. The understanding of \nthe political economy context is often weak. It also appears that \nthe  rationale  for  sector  or  thematic  prioritization  often  does \nnot  reflect  a  discussion  among  country  teams  of  the  relative \ncapacities of key crosscutting and sector agencies. Assessments of \nbasic change management issues, such as leadership, ownership, \nand stakeholder buy-in, are frequently not reflected in CSPs. In \nview of the required greater reliance on country systems, there \nis  a  need  for  a  more  effective  strategic  prioritization  of  such \ncritical country capacities as public financial management and \nresults-based management and for a clearer integration of ADB \nsector support into DMC sector strategies. CPS review processes \nneed to build on endogenous CD progress reviews at crosscutting \nthematic, sector, and local government levels.\u201d [ 110 ] \n\n109   ADB 2006g. \n110   ADB 2006g. \n \n \n\nImplications for ADB  109\n\n\fThe  CDWG  recommended  that  ADB  respond  to  these \nshortcomings  by  (i)  working  with  country  teams  to  identify \npriority organizations in DMCs to work with on CD initiatives, \n(ii)  determine  which  institutional  elements  of  the  enabling \nenvironment should be assisted as part of the CPS, (iii) determine \nkey stakeholders and partnerships or systems to be supported, \nand  (iv)  determine  how  these  initiatives  will  fit  into  sector \nplans  in  the  country  partnership  strategy.  Box  7  summarizes \nthese points. Specific expected results and associated activities \nidentified in the CDWG\u2019s final report relating to country strategy \nand  programs  and  how  to  institutionalize  a  CD  approach  are \noutlined in Appendix 5. \n\nBox 7: \n\nSummary  of  Implications  for  ADB  on  Institutionalizing  a  CD \nApproach\n\nThe findings from this study, Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncapacity development working group (CDWG) report, and 2007 CD \nretreat suggest that ADB needs to \n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\nstrengthen mechanisms to enhance understanding of the \nprogramming context, including capacity issues, as a basis \nfor country partnership strategies (CPSs), including political \neconomy issues, leadership, ownership, commitment, and \ncapacities associated with key cross-cutting and sector \nissues. Political economy analyses should be done with \nlocal stakeholders and analyses carried out by other donors \nshould be used where possible; \ndraw on this enhanced understanding to secure agreement \nwith Pacific developing member countries on CD priorities \nand strategies to be reflected in the CPS as well as sector \nstrategies and plans;\nsee the country CD strategy process as an ongoing, country-\nled process guided by participatory methods; and\nthrough consultations on the CPS, ensure a better fit \nbetween ADB programming strategies (including CD \nstrategies), Pacific country programming and CD priorities, \nand the broader reform agenda in the country.\n\nOther suggestions raised by retreat participants relating to CD \nand country programs included the following: \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nMainstream  CD  in  country  partnership  strategy \nformulation.\nAssist  countries  to  analyze  political  economy  issues \n(drivers of change).\nInvolve more players, beyond government, at the CPS \nstage. \n\n 110 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\f\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nUse  country  processes  and  the  right  local  people  to \nassess capacity. \nDo  consultation  and  participation,  as  they  are \n\u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d\nHire people who know and understand the area. \nAvoid multiple donor-led CD plans.\nDo not just focus on \u201dtechnical fixes.\u201d \nFocus on the country strategy but approve allocations \nannually.\nDo  not  focus  solely  on  money;  look  into  other \nsolutions.\nImprove incentives for staff.\n\nRetreat participants recognized the challenge of understanding \nthe  drivers  of  change  as  well  as  capacities  of  communities\u2014a \nprocess that is made more difficult by the limited time allocated \nfor  community  engagement  and  strategy  development.  A \npossible  solution  identified  for  ADB  was  to  partner  with  an \norganization that has comparative advantage, has been doing \npolitical economy, and is \u201dliving\u201d in partner countries, such as \nUNDP\u2014which  also  has  a  set  of  default  principles  for  capacity \ndevelopment (Appendix 6). \n\nOther issues for ADB consideration include \n\nthe  nature  of  the  consultation  and  participation \nprocesses required to ensure CD issues are addressed \nadequately in the CPS; \nhow to frame capacity issues in the CPS, including how \nto address them from a systems perspective; \nrole of ADB\u2019s resident missions in the CPS process;\nroles  for  CD  specialist  or  advisor  in  supporting \ndevelopment of the CPS, including integration of CD \nprinciples and strategies; \nspecial  needs  and  requirements  of  small  PDMCs\u2014do \nthey require different assessment processes?; \nhow  to  monitor  capacity  results  linked  to  the  CPS; \nand\nthe  particular  challenges  of  fragile  or  post-conflict \nstates\u2014how do these affect the CPS process? \n\nADB\u2019s  April  2007  report  on  weakly  performing  countries \naddresses the last point, indicating that ADB\u2019s response has been \n\n \n\n \n\nImplications for ADB  111\n\n\fto modify its own processes to reflect conditions on the ground. \nRecommendations  from  the  report  could  provide  a  reference \npoint  for  determining  how  to  deal  with  such  countries  in  the \nCPS process. \n\n2. \n\nCapacity Development Programming \n\nIn  considering  how  to  move  forward  with  new  programming \napproaches,  the  Pacific  department  will  have  to  determine \nwhether  it  views  CD  as  an  \u201dadd-on\u201d  or  as  something  to  be \nmainstreamed into its operations. The case studies offered a mix \nof experiences in this respect, but with the majority treating CD \nas  an  add-on  to  support  other  project  objectives.  The  CDWG \nhas  suggested  piloting  activities  leading  over  time  to  a  more \nmainstreamed approach. \n\nSpecifically,  the  CDWG  report  recommends  \u201cusing  the  new \nconceptual framework and principles on a pilot basis (selecting \none  or  two  key  executing  agencies  per  developing  member \ncountry) and in sectors in which ADB has a substantial presence, \nsuch  as  transport,  energy,  or  education.\u201d [ 111 ]  The  report  also \nrecommends  a  demand-driven  approach  in  the  selection  of \nkey executing agencies (to ensure ownership), sharing lessons \nfrom  the  pilots,  and  supporting  a  gradual  shift  in  approaches \n(such as by facilitating stakeholder analyses, organizational and \ninstitutional analyses, and establishing performance benchmarks \nand  databases).  In  addition,  the  report  calls  for  \u201cdisciplined \nanalysis\u201d of executing agency capacity and the roles of other \nstakeholders,  including  consideration  of  soft  capacities  and \nenabling  factors.

However, \nparticipants  highlighted  different  options  that  could  increase \nPacific developing member countries\u2019 role in recruitment without \nplacing new administrative burdens on them. \n\nThe discussion on TA also noted the ongoing need for capacity \nsubstitution in the region, given gaps in Pacific labor markets. \nIt  was  suggested  that  capacity  substitution  is  required  when \nno local person with technical or professional competency, or \nspecialization, is available, or when there is such a person but \nwho has no experience (for example, a new law graduate who \nmay  be  considered  as  director  for  public  prosecutions).  Some \nparticipants  underlined  the  importance  of  thinking  in  terms \nof \u201dstrategic gap filling\u201d within a long-term capacity strategy. \nSpecific strategies such as \u201ctwo-in-a-box,\u201d were also considered\u2014\ntwo people filling one position but dividing responsibilities with \nemphasis on technology or skills transfer and an exit strategy. \nFinally, as one participant noted, it is important to be clear on \nthe reasons for existing gaps, particularly in countries with a \nlong history of externally funded training programs. \n\nRetreat  participants  offered  the  following  \u201drules  of  thumb\u201d \nwith respect to capacity substitution or gap filling for weakly \nperforming states, post-conflict states, or micro states: \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nDetermine whether the need is real or perceived (Pacific \ndeveloping member country perspective).\nConsider  gap  filling  strategically  (including  whether \nthe contribution can be sustained).\nUnderstand  the  reasons  for  the  gap  (e.g.,  political \neconomy  issues)  rather  than  filling  it  without \nquestion.\nFocus on gap filling within an appropriate institutional \nframework (avoid tactical responses).\nFill gaps within a long-term CD strategy and long-term \npolitical and socioeconomic growth strategy.\nAvoid approaches that are potentially capacity negative \nor foster dependency. \nRecognize capacity substitution as a valid public policy \noption.\nSupport longer-term interventions.\n\n \n\n \n\nImplications for ADB  115\n\n\f\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nConsider volunteers as an option, especially in small \ncommunities. \n\nAgree on an exit strategy for long-term TA.\n\nEncourage pooled regional capacity, where \nappropriate, for national needs.\n\nBe selective about which sector to support.\n\nFavor \u201cessential\u201d sectors (e.g., education and health).\n\nRequire full beneficiary \u201cbuy-in,\u201d including dedicated \ncounterpart support.\n\nOther issues relating to the role of advisors touched on at the \nretreat or in the case studies include \n\nhow to ensure clear, locally owned terms of reference, \nincluding who drafts them, and who approves them;\n\nhow to link work plans of advisors not only to key \nperformance indicators but also mutually agreed key \ncapacity indicators; \n\nnaming  the  role\u2014advising,  training  or  mentoring, \nsystems  development,  or  gap  filling.  As  indicated \nin  AusAID\u2019s  recent  discussion  paper  on  technical \nassistance  and  capacity  building  in  Timor-Leste, \n\u201cnaming  the  role  matters.\u201d  Many  advisors  end \nup  performing  in-line  functions,  either  because \na  counterpart  is  not  available,  or  simply  to  fill  an \nexisting  gap  that  may  have  been  the  unspoken \nintent.  The  AusAID  paper  concludes:  \u201cBeing  clear \nabout  the  purpose  enables  more  accurate  terms  of \nreference, better matching of potential candidates to \nthe role, and helps establish transparent performance \nexpectations;\u201d [ 112 ]\n\nhow to recruit and select effective advisors, with the \nright combination of technical skills, experience, local \nknowledge, ability to facilitate, transfer skills, etc.; \n\nvalue of long-term versus short-term TA. Long-term \nTA is frequently seen as a preferred option, given the \nimportance of understanding the context, developing \nrelationships with local stakeholders, and the greater \npotential  for  focusing  on  long-term  capacity  needs. \n\n 116  \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n112 AusAID 2007b. p. 5.\n\n\fSome  cases  demonstrated  a  preference  for  short-\nterm and/or intermittent TA because it allowed local \npartners  to  benefit  from  specialized  expertise  while \nensuring local ownership of the process;\n\nhow  use  of  local  consultants  can  be  enhanced  to \nincrease  ownership,  strengthen  local  consultancy \ncapacity, and ensure better understanding of the local \ncontext  (e.g.,  culture,  traditions,  power  dynamics, \ninformal  systems,  reasons  for  capacity  problems); \nand \n\nmonitoring advisors\u2019 inputs, results, or performance. \nThis requires enhanced attention to monitoring and \nevaluation, including developing domestic capacity; \nit can also provide a boost to local accountability. \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nBox 8 summarizes the study\u2019s implications on CD planning.\n\nBox 8:   Summary of Implications for the Asian Development Bank on \n\nCapacity Development Programming\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\nSelect \u201ddemand-driven\u201d pilots in key Asian Development \nBank sectors or thematic areas in the countries to provide \na basis for initiating new capacity development (CD) \napproaches.  \n\nProvide inputs to encourage new approaches, such as \nstakeholder analysis, capacity assessments. \n\nStrengthen participatory approaches to enhance ownership \nand effectiveness of capacity development programming.\n\nEnsure programming decisions are based on strategic \nanalysis of capacity options (e.g., best entry points, \nmodalities, sustainability and an exit strategy).\n\nEnsure programming in conflict-affected communities is \ninformed by proper analyses. \n\nIncrease emphasis on capacity for demand and local \naccountability.\n\nExplore possibilities for increasing reliance on local \ncapacity-building options, such as facilities, exchanges, and \nuse of local consultants.\n\nAs noted, special consideration is needed for CD interventions \nin conflict or post-conflict situations.

Many of these agencies \nhave high technical capacity (such as in engineering, health, or \neconomic management) but often less capacity in facilitation, \nskills  transfer,  or  design  of  consultative  and  participatory \nprocesses. \n\nThe  CDWG\u2019s  final  report  and  other  ADB  documents  have \nhighlighted areas for improving ADB\u2019s business processes and \ninternal support systems. The recent report on improving ADB\u2019s \nTA program, for example, notes various procedural areas requiring \nattention including \u201capparent lack of focus for parts of the TA \nprogram;  internal  procedures,  which  can  be  time  consuming \nwhile adding limited value  to project design; an emphasis on \nprocessing until approval rather than implementation; the risk of \na supply-driven approach with insufficient ownership by DMCs \nand  executing  agencies;  and  constraints  in  ADB  internal  TA \nmanagement.\u201d [ 113 ] Priorities from the CDWG report are outlined \nin Appendix 5.\n\nThe  CD  retreat  identified  areas  where  ADB  and  other  donor \nagencies could improve business processes and support systems \nfor  CD.  For  example,  participants  indicated  a  need  for  donor \norganizations to help staff become specialists on the Pacific, as \nwell as on participatory methods. Others spoke of the need for \nADB to emphasize its role as a development institution, beyond \nthe banking side of its mandate. \n\nSpecific suggestions from the CD retreat on this topic included \nthe following: \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nCommit  more  resources  to  TA  design  and  TA \nimplementation.\n\nUse  a  more  selective  approach  in  application  of \nresources.\n\nDesign  CD  TA  in  Pacific  countries,  not  in  ADB \nheadquarters in Manila. \n\n113   ADB 2007b. p. i.\n\n \n\n \n\nImplications for ADB  119\n\n\f\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nEncourage joint donor approaches.\n\nRecognize  and  give  importance  to  CD  in  ADB \ndepartments\u2019 work plans. \n\nRely on staff with Pacific and CD experience.\n\nEncourage  application  of  innovative  tools  for \nmobilization  of  consultants  (e.g.,  framework  or \nindefinite delivery contracts).\n\nStreamline access to funds.\n\nUse flexible and adaptive designs that allow changes \nthrough the implementation phase.\n\nDo not lose sight of the value of small, flexible, rapid \nTA to respond to urgent capacity needs. \n\nStrengthen  national  consulting  capacity  in  the \nPacific. \n\nRe-examine  internal  incentives;  accountability  and \nrewards should be for outcomes, not loan designs or \nprogramming. \n\nSeek  board  and  management  approval  (exception) \nto fund Pacific country strategies rather than TA for \nweakly performing Pacific countries.\n\nBox  9  provides  a  summary  of  the  capacity  development \nimplications for ADB\u2019s businesses processes and internal support \nsystems.\n\nBox 9:   Summary  of  Implications  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n\nBusiness Processes and Internal Support Systems\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\n \u00bb\n\nStrengthen internal capacity for capacity development \nprogramming in relevant areas, such as results-based \nmanagement systems, staff skills and incentives, human \nresource management, accountability and reporting, \nknowledge management, and demand orientation. \n\nExamine options for modifying consultant recruitment and \nselection, including increasing the role of Pacific country \npartners. \n\nConsider options for Pacific island consultant rosters and \nreliance on framework agreements.\n\n 120 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fReFeRenCeS AnD ADDItIonAl \nSouRCe MAteRIAl\n\nAsian Development Bank. 2002.

The broader study will include a series \nof case studies of capacity development highlighting a range of experiences by sector, theme, \nregion, and source of external support. Particular attention will be given in the studies to more \n\u201csuccessful\u201d examples of CD while at the same time highlighting less successful initiatives and \nthe reasons for them.\n\nSelection of the cases for research has been based on, among other things, the extent to which \nthey are likely to yield lessons on\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nimportance of Pacific developing member country (PDMC) leadership or ownership in \ncapacity development initiatives (from identification through to implementation),\n\nstrategic attention to capacity issues (e.g., in national or sector strategies and plans, \nproject design, use of innovative mechanisms), \n\n\u201chard\u201d as well as \u201csoft\u201d capacity issues, and\n\neffective use of external resources for capacity development or utilization. \n\nThe research will place relatively greater emphasis on newer projects, programs, mechanisms, \nand modalities so as to draw out lessons from emerging practices. This will also help to ensure \nready access to relevant materials and stakeholders for the researcher(s). \n\nAs the points above suggest, the cases selected (notably the more successful ones) will reflect \nsituations where developing-country partners have given systematic attention to capacity issues \nand  have  demonstrated  a  clear  sense  of  leadership  or  ownership.    The  cases  will  also  look \nbeyond the usual \u201chard\u201d capacity issues (e.g., skills, organizational structures, etc.) and draw \nout the significance of \u201csoft\u201d capacities (e.g., leadership, strength of community organization, \nrelationships, legitimacy) to success.\n\n114   ADB defines capacity development as \u201cthe process whereby people, organizations, and society as a whole, unleash, strengthen, create, adapt, \n\nand maintain capacity over time.\u201d\n\n 130 \n\nLEARNING FROM SUCCESS\n\n\fThe field work for the case studies will be guided by a series of questions (see Appendix 2). In \nan overall sense though, the research will test this basic hypothesis: \n\n \nProspects for developing or effectively utilizing domestic capacity are enhanced when a) \ncapacity issues (individual, organizational and institutional) are addressed systematically \nand on an ongoing basis, and b) the approach to CD is rooted in host country vision and leadership.  \n \n\nThe findings from the various case studies (e.g., what makes for \u201cgood practice\u201d, the reasons \nfor success) will be distilled in a final report with a view to providing guidance to ADB and all \ndevelopment partners to improve future assistance for capacity development in the region.\n\nThe consultants will be hired for a period of up to six weeks, on an intermittent basis, commencing \nas soon as possible, with a completion date of 18 May 2007. S/he will be expected to undertake a \nreview of the relevant documentation, followed by interviews and other field work in the relevant \ncountry after which s/he will submit a draft report and participate in a \u201cwriteshop\u201d tentatively \nscheduled to be held in Manila during the second half of April. A final report will be prepared \nsubsequent to the writeshop and provision of feedback from ADB and the team leader for the \nstudy. The field work will require a period of up to 1 month. (The precise number of days required \nwill be determined, in part, by the number of cases involved). The remaining time in the contract \nwill be for a) attendance at the writeshop, and b) follow up work subsequent to the writeshop on \nissues requiring further investigation. \n\nThe team leader for the broader ADB initiative is Joe Bolger, a Canadian-based ADB-funded \nconsultant with considerable experience in the South Pacific (e-mail: jbolger@videotron.ca tel/\nfax:(613) 446-1080). He will oversee and support the work of the Pacific Islands consultants \nengaged to prepare the case studies. The task manager is Stephen J. Pollard, principal economist, \nADB (e-mail: spollard@adb.org, tel (632) 632-5784). A panel of other international consultants \nwill also support the work.\n \n The consultant will undertake the following specific tasks:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nReview relevant documentation pertaining to CD in the country being studied. This \nwill include PDMC national and sectoral plans, strategies, evaluations, and reviews. \n\nReview relevant ADB corporate documents relating to CD and technical assistance \n(TA). \n\n(iii) \n\nReview other relevant development partner CD documentation (e.g., research studies, \nevaluations) pertaining to the country in question. \n\n(iv) \n\nIdentify key principal(s) responsible for helping develop capacity in the example to \nbe studied.\n\n(v) \n\nConduct a field study on CD in sector x in country y based on the questionnaire \nand framework developed for this study (see Appendix 2). The field study will \ninclude interviews and focus groups (as appropriate) with relevant stakeholders \nand key informants; e.g., government partners, private sector interests, civil society \n\nAppendix 3  131\n\n\forganizations, academics, development partners. The researcher will also endeavor \nto secure personal reflections from key practitioners who have been involved in CD \ninitiatives.\n\n(vi) \n\nPrepare a paper (20\u201325 pages) which will include a background section describing, \namong other things, the origins of the initiative(s) studied and the context in which \nthey were implemented, as well as a detailed analysis of key issues and lessons \nlearned with respect to capacity development. Consistent with the emphasis in the \nstudy noted above, particular attention will be given to PDMC strategies for CD, the \ninfluence of local ownership, leadership, participation, and demand on the initiative. \nIn addition, the paper will identify themes, practices, and principles that might guide \nfuture CD in the Pacific. (Note: additional information will be provided to guide the \nresearch, including ADB\u2019s CD framework and other relevant literature on capacity \ndevelopment from the international development community.) \n\noutput, Report Requirements\n\nA draft report will be submitted to ADB by early to mid-March, and will be finalized by 30 April \n2007, reflecting feedback from ADB, including the team leader, the task manager, CD panelists, \nand writeshop participants. \n\nPlaces of Assignment\n\nThe documentation review will primarily be conducted at home office. Initial briefings by the \nteam leader will be by telephone and via e-mail exchanges.

Rather than accepting \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approaches, the partners \nat country level can customize their rules of engagement for capacity development.\n\n1.   Do not rush. Capacity development is a long-term process. It is not amenable to delivery \npressures, quick fixes and short-term results seeking. Engagement for capacity development \nneeds to have a long-term horizon and be reliable.\n\n2. \n\n3.  \n\n4.  \n\n5 \n\n6.  \n\n7.  \n\nRespect  the  value  systems  and  foster  self-esteem. The imposition of alien values can \nundermine confidence. Capacity development requires respect. Self-esteem is at the root \nof capacity and empowerment.\n\nScan locally and globally; reinvent locally. There are no blueprints. Capacity development \nmeans learning. Learning is a voluntary process that requires genuine commitment and \ninterest. Knowledge transfer is no longer seen as the relevant modality. Knowledge needs \nto be acquired.\n\nChallenge mindsets and power differentials. Capacity development is not power neutral \nand  challenging  vested  interest  is  difficult.  Frank  dialogue  and  moving  from  closed \ncurtains to a collective culture of transparency is essential to promote a positive dynamic \nfor overcoming them.\n\nThink  and  act  in  terms  of  sustainable  capacity  outcomes.  Capacity  is  at  the  core  of \ndevelopment. Any course of action needs to promote this end. Responsible leaders can \ninspire their institutions and societies to effectively work towards capacity development.\n\nEstablish positive incentives. Distortions in public sector employment are major obstacles \nto capacity development. Ulterior motives and perverse incentives need to be aligned with \nthe  objective  of  capacity  development.  Governance  systems  respectful  of  fundamental \nrights are a powerful incentive.\n\nIntegrate external inputs into national priorities, processes and systems. External inputs \nneed  to  correspond  to  real  demand  and  need  to  be  flexible  to  respond  effectively  to \nnational needs and possibilities. Where such systems are not strong enough they need to \nbe reformed and strengthened, not bypassed.\n\nAppendix 6  141\n\n\f8. \n\n9.  \n\nBuild  on  existing  capacities  rather  than  creating  new  ones.  This  implies  the  use  of \nnational expertise as prime option, resuscitation and strengthening of national institutions, \nand protecting social and cultural capital.\n\nStay  engaged  under  difficult  circumstances.  The  weaker  the  capacity,  the  greater  the \nneed. Weak capacities are not an argument for withdrawal or for driving external agendas. \nPeople should not be hostage to irresponsible governance.\n\n10.   Remain  accountable  to  ultimate  beneficiaries.  Even  where  national  governments  are \nnot  responding  to  the  needs  of  their  people,  external  partners  need  to  be  accountable \nto beneficiaries and contribute to the responsibilization of national authorities. Sensible \napproaches in concrete situations need to be openly discussed and negotiated with national \nstakeholders.\n\nSource: UNDP. 2003. Ownership, Leadership and Transformation.
