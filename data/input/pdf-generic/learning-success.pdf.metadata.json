The results of all this investment have been mixed \nat best. Most PDMCs are just as heavily reliant today on externally financed technical assistance \nand training and other means to build capacity as they have ever been. \nA review, entitled Governance in the Pacific: Focus for Action 2005\u20132009, funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), concluded that \u201cinadequate capacity building, coupled with the loss \nof senior staff who have management and technical skills, is common in many Pacific DMCs.\u201d \nThe ADB review noted that \u201cthe failure of most Pacific DMCs to train and retain many of their \nmost skilled and motivated people, especially in Polynesia but increasingly in other countries, \nis a long-standing contributor to concerns over the quality of governance and institutions.\u201d \nFurthermore, according to ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy for 2005\u20132009, \u201ctoo often, capacity building \nhas been related to the objectives of the project rather than to those of the host organization, or \ncapacity building requirements have been insufficiently analyzed, planned, or coordinated.\u201d\nThe continuing need to build domestic capacity remains important for three key result areas of \nADB\u2019s Pacific strategy: (i) establishing an effective institutional framework for developing skills \nin response to labor market demands; (ii) managing and delivering quality basic social services; \nand (iii) strengthening capacity of PDMC governments, civil society, and private sector groups \nto plan and manage for development results.\nDespite the historical challenges and shortcomings, public sector capacity has been successfully \nbuilt and sustained in each of the PDMCs. Central government departments, for example, have \nbuilt and sustained their capacity to supply improved health and education services. In some \nPDMCs, state-owned enterprises have strengthened and maintained their capacity to provide \nefficient and effective services to the public, while independent authorities have been established \nand have successfully maintained their ability to deliver services. In addition, civil society groups \nin the region have enhanced their capacity to mobilize communities, advocate reforms, and \ndeliver services to Pacific island communities. \nAs noted in the cases described in this study, the \u201csuccesses\u201d can be attributed to a number \nof factors, such as strong leadership, effective community participation or demand, solid \nunderstanding of the programming context, getting the incentives right, or effective use of \ntechnical advisors. However, our understanding of the reasons for success has tended to be \nproject or program specific, or anecdotal, and after decades of external assistance to build \ncapacity in the Pacific, it is time that the Pacific stakeholders and their development partners \nbetter understand how capacity can be successfully built and sustained. This study seeks to \ncontribute to that objective.\nForeword  vii", "Capacity development has long been a challenge for PDMCs and something of an enigma for \nexternal assistance agencies. A basic problem is, as the author of this report, Joe Bolger, observes, \nthat capacity development in the Pacific can be seen as \u201ca prism-like phenomenon that yields \ndifferent images depending on how you look at it.\u201d To capture all perspectives of this prism, the \nstudy contracted a series of 20 case studies from 11 countries across the region, prepared primarily \nby consultants from the Pacific islands. They cover a range of programming experiences\u2014from \neconomic planning, to infrastructure development, health and legal sector reform, civil society \nenhancement, fisheries, and one regional initiative. The cases include programming funded by \nvarious bilateral and multilateral donors.\nThe study contains analyses and recommendations on the approaches to capacity development \nthat work best and the conditions that have been conducive to their success, the unique challenges \nfaced by PDMCs in addressing capacity constraints, and the implications for future interventions \nat both the strategic and operational levels.\nA separate report, entitled A Framework for Capacity Development in the Pacific Islands, by \nMichael Heppell, explores the capacity needs and prerequisites for capacity development of critical \ngovernment agencies in PDMCs. It includes a framework to establish appropriate conditions for \nfuture capacity development interventions, and a regional action plan.\nI hope that the findings and recommendations contained in these two reports will help guide \nfuture capacity building efforts in the Pacific. \nFinally, I would like to express my gratitude to the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment for cofinancing this initiative and offering valuable technical advice. I would also \nbe remiss if I did not express sincere appreciation for the collaboration of participating PDMCs \nand other donor agencies without whose cooperation this study would not have been possible. \nSultan Hafeez Rahman\nDirector General\nPacific Department\n viii  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "ACKnowleDgeMent\nThe author would like to thank the following people for their support during the research phase \nand in the preparation of this report.

ADB staff since developed a medium-term framework and action plan \nfor strengthening assistance for CD in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). The action \nplan calls for ADB-sponsored CD efforts to be more efficient, effective, and demand-driven. \nMore effective CD interventions should contribute to better and more sustainable results by DMC \norganizations and groups, and ultimately to improved quality and coverage of public services, \nas well as reduced poverty in the region. \nTo advance this agenda and better understand CD in the Pacific region, ADB\u2019s Pacific department \ncommissioned a regional study in the latter part of 2006. The study is based on 20 case studies \nfrom 11 countries across the region, prepared by Pacific island consultants. This report includes \nfindings and recommendations that have benefited from inputs from an August 2007 capacity \ndevelopment retreat at ADB headquarters. ADB intends to use the findings and recommendations \nof the study to guide future capacity-building efforts in the Pacific. \nThe cases chosen for the study represent a cross section of experiences in the region by sector, \nthematic area, and source of funding. They cover programming experiences from economic \nplanning, to infrastructure development, health and legal sector reform, civil society enhancement, \nfisheries, and one regional initiative. The study also explored approaches to CD relying on \ndifferent modalities. While the research was intended to reflect a wide range of experiences, \nrelatively greater weight was given to initiatives considered by stakeholders to be \u201dsuccessful.\u201d \nInitiatives that were contemporary, including some that would help to deepen understanding of \nemerging practices in the region, were also emphasized. \nCapacity Development: the Concept \nIncreased interest in CD in the 1980s onward has largely been a response to acknowledged \nshortcomings in development assistance, in particular, concerns about the effectiveness of \ntechnical assistance and the sustainability of capacity gains. Over the years, the concept has \nevolved with increased attention to capacity of larger systems,\u201csoft capacities,\u201d and recognition \nthat CD is strongly context and situation specific. The discussion of CD in this report is guided \nby the definition developed by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and adopted by ADB:\n\u201cCapacity development is the process whereby people, organizations, and society as a whole \nunleash, strengthen, create, adapt and maintain capacity over time.\u201d\nExecutive Summary  xi", "overview of Findings \nMost of the case studies reflected a tendency, \nnot unique to the Pacific region, to think of  \u201c\u2026the ultimate goal of capacity \ndevelopment programs is to support \ncapacity primarily in terms of individual skills \nthe development of better skilled and \nor  organizational  competencies.  \u201dCapacity  oriented individuals, more responsive \ndevelopment\u201d  is,  thus,  frequently  equated  and effective institutions and a better \npolicy environment for pursuing \nwith training or support for some type of \ndevelopment objectives.

Background \nThe idea of capacity development (CD) has gained increasing \nprominence in the international development community over \nthe past two decades. In 1993, World Bank Vice President \nEdward (Kim) Jaycox declared CD to be \u201cthe missing link in \nAfrican development.\u201d In 1997, the Development Assistance \nCommittee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD) issued the document Shaping the 21st \nCentury [ 1 ], which described a new approach to development \ncooperation, including greater emphasis on CD within \u201ceffective \npartnerships.\u201d In 2004, Francis Fukuyama [ 2 ] declared that donors \nshould define capacity as the primary objective of all development \nassistance, rather than focusing on services, infrastructure, or \nother results. \n1    OECD-DAC, Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Cooperation, Paris, May, \n1996.\n2   Fukuyama 2004. \n    Introduction  1", "In 2005, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness affirmed \nthe importance of CD, as well as ownership, harmonization, \nalignment, results, and mutual accountability. The Paris \nDeclaration specifically described \u201ccapacity to plan, manage, \nimplement and account for results of policies and programmes \n(as) critical for achieving development objectives from analysis \nand  dialogue  through  implementation,  monitoring  and \nevaluation.\u201d These references to CD were embraced under the \nPacific Principles for Effective Aid. [ 3 ]\nIn 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted CD as a \nthematic priority and viewed strengthening developing-country \ncapacity not only as a means to enhance performance but also \nas a goal in its own right. ADB has since developed a medium-\nterm framework and action plan [ 4 ] for strengthening assistance \nfor CD in developing member countries (DMCs). ADB\u2019s action \nplan calls for ADB-sponsored CD efforts to be more efficient, \neffective, and demand-driven. More effective CD interventions \nwith DMC partners are expected to contribute to better and \nmore sustainable results by DMC organizations and groups that \nwill help them realize intermediate outcomes, such as improved \nservice delivery and better legal and regulatory enforcement. \nThe anticipated long-term impact is better quality and expanded \ncoverage of public services, and ultimately reduced poverty in \nthe region. The action plan also reaffirms ADB\u2019s commitment, \narticulated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, to \nincrease the \u201calignment of their aid with partner countries\u2019 \npriorities, systems and procedures and helping to strengthen \ntheir capacities.\u201d\nThe objectives outlined in ADB\u2019s medium-term framework and \naction plan are highly relevant to the Pacific region, given the \nnumber of weakly performing countries. Many countries in the \nPacific are constrained by policy and institutional weaknesses \n3   Two of the Pacific aid effectiveness principles refer specifically to capacity development (the \ncorresponding Paris Declaration Principles are noted in parentheses): Principle 5: Strengthened \ninstitutional mechanisms and capacity in countries to enable increased use of local systems by \ndevelopment partners. (Paris Declaration 17, 21, 22-24, 31; Indicator 4, 6, 8). Principle 6: (i) \nProvision of technical assistance (TA), including in aid coordination/management, in such a \nway that ensures that capacity is built with tangible benefits to the country to support national \nownership. Provision of an appropriate level of counterpart resources through established \nprocedures and mechanisms. (ii) Short-term TA, that addresses local skills gaps to conduct \nstudies, is culturally sensitive.

ADB intends to use the \nfindings and recommendations to guide future capacity-building \nefforts in the Pacific. The study was based on a series of 20 case \nstudies from 11 countries across the region, prepared mainly by \nPacific island consultants (see Appendix 1 for a list of cases and \nresearchers). A questionnaire was provided to the consultants \nas the basis for developing each case study (Appendix 2). An \ninterim report was presented at a workshop at ADB headquarters \nin August 2007. The report was modified based on feedback from \nworkshop participants. \nThe study, and associated dialogue with regional partners, also \nsupports ADB\u2019s objective of \u201cforming successful partnerships in \nthe Pacific islands to build public sector capacity as a means to \nguiding more effective CD interventions in the future.\u201d \nB.   Scope of Study and the Process\nThis study had three phases. During the first phase, the team \nleader met ADB and other donor agency representatives in \nAustralia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines to (i) establish \nkey issues from donor experience; (ii) produce a long list of \npossible case studies; (iii) validate the proposed focus of the \nstudy; and (iv) suggest a process for further Pacific island country \nreviews and for further donor discussions, while preparing an \ninitial framework for the case studies. \nThe second phase entailed identification and hiring of consultant \nresearchers from the Pacific Islands and preparation of the first \ngroup of case studies to affirm key issues and themes. These case \nstudies were presented by the researchers at an ADB-sponsored \n\u201dwriteshop\u201d in Sydney in April 2007. Based on feedback from \nwriteshop participants (i.e., the other researchers, plus selected \nresource persons and donor representatives), the researchers \n    Introduction  3", "finalized their reports with the support of resource persons [ 5 ]\nand the team leader. \nAt the writeshop, Pacific islanders suggested follow-up on this \ninitiative in the region. Toward that end, Vaine Wichman, the \ncase researcher from the Cook Islands, made a presentation on \nthe study at the July 2007 Forum Economic Ministers Meeting \n(FEMM) in Palau. \nThe August 2007 workshop in Manila was part of the third \nphase of the study. It provided an opportunity to present the \ninterim findings and to reflect on options for moving the CD \nagenda forward in PARD. Participants included PARD staff, \nselected Pacific island consultants, resource persons, donor \nrepresentatives, and the team leader. The workshop was followed \nby a session with donors on 20\u201321 August, at which ADB \nreported the study findings. \nThe cases chosen for the study represent a cross section of experiences \nin the region by sector and thematic area, as well as source of funding. \nMost of the cases were ADB-funded initiatives, with others being \nsupported by the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID), New Zealand\u2019s International Aid and Development \nAgency (NZAID), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), \nand the World Bank. The cases covered programming experiences \nfrom economic planning to infrastructure development, health and \nlegal sector reform, civil society enhancement, fisheries, and one \nregional initiative.

They had to immerse \nthemselves in the complexities of CD over a relatively short \ntime and were asked to prepare the cases using a story-telling \napproach. Ultimately, the case studies reflect our collective, \nongoing learning about what CD actually means in the Pacific \nin the early days of the 21st century, while hopefully being true \nto Pacific story-telling traditions.  \n 6  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "II. CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\nA.   why Capacity Development? origins \nand evolution of the Concept \nIncreased interest in CD in the 1980s and 1990s was largely \na response to acknowledged shortcomings in development \nassistance over the preceding 40 years, in particular, concerns \nabout the effectiveness of technical assistance (TA) and limited \napparent success in realizing sustainable capacity gains. This led \nincreasingly to calls for more systematic and holistic approaches, \nand with greater emphasis on country ownership and sustainable \nresults. \nSince CD came to the fore in the 1990s, numerous reports, \nstudies, papers, and official donor documents have reflected an \nincreasingly sophisticated perspective on the concept. Recent \ntrends in thinking about CD include the following: [ 6 ]\n\u2022\t Movement away from thinking exclusively about \nindividual and organizational capacity to capacity of \nnetworks and larger systems.\n\u2022\t Greater  recognition  of  the  importance  of  \u201csoft \ncapacities,\u201d such as leadership, relationships, legitimacy, \nincentives, motivations, and culture.\n\u2022\t Recognition that CD is a dynamic process and strongly \ncontext and situation specific\u2014no \u201cone size fits all.\u201d \n\u2022\t CD cannot be \u201crolled out from the top;\u201d it is a process \nof \u201cdecentralized social learning.\u201d\n\u2022\t CD is not necessarily neutral; it can change, or can \nbe affected by social, political, cultural, and economic \nrelations. \n6    Ubels et al. 2005. \nCapacity Development  7", "wItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent", "B.  what Do we Mean by \nCapacity Development?\nThis discussion of CD is guided by the definition developed by \nthe DAC and adopted by ADB, among other agencies:\n\u201cCapacity development is the process whereby people, \norganizations,  and  society  as  a  whole  unleash, \nstrengthen, create, adapt, and maintain capacity over \ntime.\u201d\nThis definition highlights several important considerations: \nthe idea of CD as a multidimensional phenomenon (i.e., \ninvolving people, organizations, and society as a whole) that \nis country-owned, open to the lessons of experience and the \nflexibility to modify approaches, while maintaining a focus on \nsustainability.\nHowever,  as  Morgan, [ 7 ]  among  others,  noted,  numerous \nframeworks have been developed to improve analysis of capacity \nissues, each of which reflects a different theory of change or view \nof human behavior. The various CD frameworks or perspectives \ndraw on different disciplines or bodies of knowledge, including \norganizational development, political economy, institutional \neconomics, strategic management, and systems thinking or \ncomplexity theory. \nThis report acknowledges the value of all of these perspectives, \neach of which was represented in varying degrees in the case \nstudies. Some cases, for example, emphasized systems thinking as \na way of understanding and responding to capacity challenges. \nThis reflected the reality observed in many of the cases that \ninvolved complex change processes involving multiple actors \noperating within and across diverse systems. Other cases focused \nmore on political economy issues, strategic management, or \napplication of organizational development principles.\nBeyond the diverse views on capacity development alluded to \nhere, there is general agreement on certain underlying principles \nand orientations that collectively distinguish CD from other \napproaches to, or perspectives on, development. The principles \nare that CD is based on\n\u2022\t broad-based participation and a locally driven \nagenda,\n7 Morgan 2006.  \nCapacity Development  9", "\u2022\t understanding of the context,\n\u2022\t building on local capacities, \n\u2022\t ongoing learning and adaptation,\n\u2022\t long-term investments,\n\u2022\t integration of activities at various levels to address \ncomplex problems.\nC.   the \u201cHow to\u201d of Capacity Development \nThe strategies or \u201dhow to\u201d of CD embraced by practitioners, \nmanagers, or analysts usually reflect the school of thought \nto which they subscribe. Nongovernment organizations, for \nexample, tend to follow an organizational development model, \ndrawing occasionally on political economy analyses. Private \nsector organizational specialists tend to think in terms of \ninstitutional economics\u2014supply and demand and incentives \nthat drive behavior. Some donors, such as the United Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) draw on a \npolitical economy perspective emphasizing power and \u201ddrivers of \nchange.\u201d Most other donor agencies tend to take an instrumental \nview of capacity issues, relying on strategic management tools \nand results-based management, with a particular emphasis on \ntechnical and managerial capacities required for performance \nimprovement, often to the relative exclusion of social, political, \nor cultural dimensions that might influence behavior.\nOperational strategies for CD [ 8 ] include\n\u2022\t eliminating old or inappropriate capacity,\n\u2022\t reducing demand on existing capacity,\n\u2022\t making better use of existing capacity and strengthening \nit,\n\u2022\t providing space for innovation or creative use of \ncapacities, and\n\u2022\t creating new capacity.\nExperience suggests that project or program planners often \ngravitate  instinctively  toward  strengthening  capacity  or \ncreating new capacity (through training or by focusing on new \norganizational structures) in response to development problems. \n8 Morgan 1998. \n 10  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "However, this has frequently proven to be inadequate, particularly \nwhen dealing with deeply rooted political or socioeconomic \nproblems. \nThe tendency toward \u201ddeveloping\u201d new capacity has also led \nmany observers to suggest that other options, such as making \nbetter use of existing capacity, should be considered first in the \ninterest of sustainability and local ownership. The latter might \ninvolve, for example, reviewing an organization\u2019s incentive \nsystems (e.g., benefits, incentives, opportunities for professional \nadvancement) before committing to a significant investment in \ntraining. Similarly, promoting collaboration among organizations \n(e.g., a coalition of health agencies) may lead to better use of \nexisting capacity and be more effective than seeking to redress \ncapacity gaps in each organization.\nD.   ADB\u2019s Approach to Capacity \nDevelopment\nAs noted above, ADB has endorsed the DAC\u2019s definition of CD. \nHowever, ADB also recognizes the multiplicity of definitions \nand that different stakeholders have their own definition or \ncharacterization of capacity and CD. ADB\u2019s framework and action \nplan rely on a template that draws on common features from \nvarious definitions but allows the Pacific countries to determine \ntheir own definition or concept of CD. ADB\u2019s perspective on \nCD is rooted in an assumption that public sector agencies will \nremain the key entry points for ADB\u2019s CD operations, but that \nother key organizations and groups, such as the private sector \nand civil society, also have significant roles to play. \nADB\u2019s CD framework is based on a systems perspective with \nthree main dimensions: (i) organizations, (ii) institutions,and \n(iii) interorganizational and/or group relations. As illustrated \nin Figure 1, entry points for CD can be at the organizational, \ninstitutional, or network/partnership level. The framework also \nacknowledges the possibility of interventions that cut across the \nsystem, dealing simultaneously or sequentially with capacity \nissues at different levels.\nCapacity Development  11", "Figure 1: Framework for Capacity Development\n\u0083 Poverty PRleadnunictnigoP nua bnSltidr c IaFtimenpglaiecn cimael ntMatainoangement\u0083  S\u0083 ubGnovaAtenirtoincnaoanrlrc/Lueoptcialo\u0083 \u0083on  rgaWCPononiomtilzhiercma gictetIluwasiineon annsoniCnctti raosdzMik,tt a nipnauo/tetePnntiretsodafiw oxoaanrrotnnttm,rdenk aga  siaeln,nr  narctoeesndur hd taoap icp\u0083rbptga ijoeretntcLns\u0083sete  giLrvaeslgeA  aidsnlmadt iJinvuieds tiRrcaeiatfoilv Rreme afonordm RgDe4cisiSo\u0083onc ietPya irnt iPciupbaltiico n of Civil \n\u0083  Internal Management Dimensions\noRg1 \u0083   Clarity of mandate/leadership Impact\n\u0083  Ability to plan, monitor, and learn \u0083  Effectiveness\n\u0083  Systems orientation (internal and  \u0083  Efficiency\nexternal) \u0083  Sustainability\n\u0083  Adequate structures and processes\n\u0083  Financial and Human resources\n\u0083  Technology & infrastructure\noRg\n3\noRg\n2\nCD intervention point\nSource: ADB capacity development working group discussions\nADB\u2019s medium-term framework and action plan distinguish \nbetween  capacity  development  and  governance,  noting: \n\u201cGovernance and CD differ insofar as governance is a normative \nconcept that identifies certain standards, such as transparency \nand accountability, and measures country circumstances against \nthese standards. In contrast, CD places emphasis on achieving \nobjectives identified by DMC organizations and other relevant \nstakeholders. CD is instrumental to achieve governance objectives \nas it is to achieve environment, gender or sector objectives.\u201d [ 9 ] \nThe action plan also notes that governance and capacity \ndevelopment are mutually supportive, because realization of \ngovernance objectives, such as improved accountability, often \nrequires an investment in capacity just as strengthening capacity \nfrequently depends on adequate governance conditions. \nFinally, it is worth reiterating that ADB has endorsed the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness, with its commitments to \nincreased country ownership, harmonization, alignment, and \ncapacity development.\n9  ADB 2006g. p. 15. \n 12  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "III. tHe StuDy - oVeRVIew \noF FInDIngS\nData for this review came from various sources, including the \ncase studies, articles, papers, reviews, and evaluations relating \nto CD and aid effectiveness (See references and additional \nsource material). Information on ADB initiatives also came from \nevaluations and technical assistance completion reports prepared \nby ADB staff. It should be noted that while ADB has recently \nintroduced a classification system for CD, it is only beginning to \nreport on CD systematically. At this stage, most of the focus in \nCD reporting is on \u201dquality-at-entry\u201d considerations. \nAusAID staff and consultants also provided material for this \nreview,  including  evaluation  reports  and  lessons-learned \ndocuments that capture AusAID\u2019s experience in CD in a range \nof sectors and thematic areas. \nA.  Conceptualization and Planning of \nCapacity Development Programming\n1.  Articulation of Capacity Issues\nOne aspect of this study was to learn how PDMC stakeholders \nthink about \u201ccapacity\u201d and what \u201ccapacity development\u201d means \nto them\u2014conceptually and operationally. Most of the cases, as \nwell as the material reviewed for the study, reflect a tendency, not \nunique to the Pacific region, to think of \u201ccapacity\u201d primarily in \nterms of individual skills or organizational competencies. Thus, \n\u201ccapacity development\u201d is frequently equated with training or \nsupport for some type of organizational development process. \nThis perspective is reflected in Esekia Solofa\u2019s case study on the \nSamoa Public Sector Improvement Facility which notes: \u201cEver \nsince the start of the New Zealand scholarship scheme for Samoa \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  13", "(which predated Samoa\u2019s independence by several years), Samoa \nhas always understood the capacity building and development \npurpose behind aid, although in its narrow sense of human \nresource development (HRD).\u201d [ 10 ]\nHowever, some cases highlight movement toward an emerging \ninternational \u201cconsensus\u201d on CD, with increased attention to \ncapacity systems, interorganizational relationships and enabling \nconditions, even if they are not always articulated in CD terms. \nThe way capacity and CD are conceived in the Pacific region was \nseen as worthy of attention because much of the literature, guides, \ntool boxes, etc., on CD has emerged from the donor community; \nand CD is consistently referred to in those documents as an \nendogenous or locally-driven process. The question that arises \nis whose view or concept prevails. Is it the definition adopted by \ndonors through the DAC, which sees CD as endogenous process, \nbased on a notion of levels and a systemic approach, [ 11 ] or is \nit a conceptualization that focuses largely on human resource \ndevelopment and the capabilities of individual organizations? \nOr are we seeing a convergence of views over time? The cases \nsuggest there is some convergence, although the language and \npractices between donors and developing-country partners still \ndiffer.\n2.  Capacity Assessment Processes\nConsistent with the perspectives on CD noted above, few of \nthe cases revealed a systematic approach to analyzing or \naddressing capacity issues during the planning and design \nstages. To the extent that it was done, there was a tendency \nto focus on \u201ccapacity gaps\u201d or deficiencies, but with limited \nsystematic attention to capacity systems, e.g., the capacity of \norganizations to work together, or the potentially constraining \nimpact of \u201ccapacity-negative\u201d policies or institutional rules. \nThe cases also demonstrated little attention specifically to soft \ncapacities, such as leadership, legitimacy, values, or identity as \n10   Solofa 2007a. p. 14.\n11    DAC uses the term \u201dsystemic approach\u201d to refer to the interaction \nbetween capacity levels (individual, organizational, and enabling \nenvironment). This language is used interchangeably throughout this \nreport with the idea of a systems approach or systems thinking, with \na recognition that the latter is backed up by a much more complex \nbody of theory, which we do not endeavor to unbundle.\n 14  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "part of the assessment process. This does not necessarily mean \nthat stakeholders were not attentive to such issues, rather, that \nthey simply were not part of the formal assessment process. \nAmong the exceptions was the Tuvalu Trust Fund case, which \nincorporated a more purposeful approach to capacity issues from \nthe start. The Government requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom ADB to develop the idea of a trust fund into a project. It was \nagreed that the approach would, among other things: \u201cDetermine \nthe critical success factors for capacity development at the island \nlevel and develop a model that could be applied, building on \nstrengths and supporting weaknesses.\u201d [ 12 ] The TA focused on \nstrengthening the capacity of central and local governments in \nplanning, managing, and implementing development projects.\nSimilarly, the Provincial Performance Improvement Initiative \n(PPII), an AusAID-funded project in Papua New Guinea (PNG), \nhas built on an extensive diagnosis of service delivery in the \ncountry while its own feasibility study examined key institutional \nconstraints. The latter was followed in PPII\u2019s first phase by a \n\u201csystematic analysis of the capacities of the provincial, district \nand local level government administration in relation to service \ndelivery.\u201d [ 13 ] This led in turn to provincial corporate plans and \nprovided a basis for supporting CD plans for participating \nprovinces. \nThe designs of other cases were clearly responsive to shifts \nwithin broader capacity systems that often opened up space to \nadvance new policies or ways of using or strengthening domestic \ncapacity. However, they were not usually informed by detailed \ncapacity analyses leading to specific CD plans, as in PPII. \n3.  Role of PDMC Stakeholders\nThe extent to which PDMC stakeholders were involved in the \nplanning and design of CD interventions varied among the case \nstudies. Most of the countries in the study are considered fragile \nstates or weakly performing countries, which means that they \noften have limited capacity to engage in assessment and design \nprocesses. ADB\u2019s 2007 report on weakly performing countries \n12  Bell 2007. p. 2.\n13  Saldanha 2007. p. 3.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  15", "addresses this issue and the associated challenges, including \nhow to promote ownership when capacity is weak and national \ninstitutions are fragile. [ 14 ]\nNevertheless, a great deal of the success in the case studies can \nbe attributed to the engagement of local stakeholders, whether \nthrough consultative processes, participatory designs, or outright \nleadership in identification, planning, and design. The pattern for \nengagement varied significantly from clear local identification of \nthe issue(s) to be addressed to reliance on external change agents \nto identify options for reform, which were picked up by local \npartners. These variations raise questions about how we define \nownership, particularly in fragile states with serious capacity \nconstraints\u2014 an issue touched on later in this report.\n \nIn the Tonga health management case study, author Kaveinga \nTu\u2019itahi speaks of the ministry staff defining the key directions \nfor the project. He quotes one of the senior managers in the \nGovernment as follows: \u201cI can say that effectively all they \n(AusAID) did was ask us what we needed, then they just \ncoached us along and facilitated our journey in this project.\u201d [ 15 ]\nADB\u2019s Implementation of the Urban Planning and Management \nStrategy (TA No. 3860), 2002\u20132004, in Samoa also underlined \nthe significance of participatory processes and broad stakeholder \nsupport, including in the TA design. Government agencies \nand the TA steering committee actively participated, and the \nGovernment demonstrated its ongoing commitment. In other \ncase studies, including Samson Rihuoha\u2019s examination of \ninstitutional strengthening of Solomon Islands Ministry of \nInfrastructure Development, local leadership in setting directions \nwas less evident (although not totally absent), given the severe \ncapacity constraints the ministry was facing in the aftermath of \nthat country\u2019s ethnic conflict.   \n4.  Defining Capacity objectives \nAs suggested above, capacity objectives were rarely defined \nexplicitly in the cases. In fact, in most cases, objectives were \n14   ADB 2007a. This report contains ADB\u2019s approach to engaging with weakly performing \ncountries. According to the report, ADB has modified its own processes to reflect the realities \non the ground in weakly performing countries.\n15  Tu\u2019itahi 2007a. p. 8.\n 16  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "wItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\nwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent", "defined in terms of expected performance improvements, with \nimproved capacity almost an implicit feature of the design. \nIt was even rarer for a project to incorporate a \u201dgrand design\u201d \nfor CD. When capacity objectives were spelled out, it was \nusually in relation to specific perceived shortcomings in local \nskills, competencies, or organizational capacities that were seen \nas key to addressing a specific performance deficiency, such as \npoor water and sanitation or health services. There were some \nexceptions, particularly in some of the larger reform programs, \nfor example, the PPII and the Capacity Building Service Centre, \nboth in PNG, where capacity objectives have been defined \nmore explicitly and in more holistic terms than elsewhere. In \nthese cases, the project designers made clear links between \nindividual competencies, organizational capacity, policies, and \ninstitutional conditions required to support and sustain capacity \nimprovements.  \nSome cases focused specifically on higher-level capacity issues, \nsuch as linking different or complementary capacities through \nnetworking, or seeking to create more enabling conditions for \ncapacity utilization via policy reform. Again, these were rarely, \nif at all, described as \u201dcapacity\u201d strategies, or even acknowledged \nas strategies that could have a capacity benefit, for example, \nunleashing capacity, removing binding constraints to capacity, \nor institutionalizing incentives for more effective capacity \nutilization. \nThe experiences described above raise some questions about \nhow capacity and CD are conceived and factored into the design \nof development projects or programs. In some cases, capacity \nissues were dealt with explicitly, but more often they were not. \nSome of the cases highlight CD as a planned process with inputs \nsequenced in a \u201dbuilding block\u201d approach, whereas in others, the \napproach was emergent, in many respects informal, although at \ntimes informed by reasonably systematic processes of reflection \nand learning. And finally, while some cases embraced a holistic \napproach to capacity issues, others focused on \u201dpieces of the \npuzzle\u201d that were well (or less well) connected to the larger \nwhole.   \nWhile acknowledging that most interventions lacked an explicit \nor detailed capacity strategy, many were actually guided by what \n 18  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "may be described as a mental model or view of how change \nwould unfold. This is consistent with the findings from some of \nthe case studies in the European Centre for Development Policy \nManagement study on capacity, change and performance, [ 16 ]\nwhich noted: \n\u201c\u2026everybody  in  the  cases,  be  they  analysts  or \npractitioners, who dealt with capacity issues had tacit \nmental models or \u2018frames\u2019 of change and capacity \ndevelopment. They subscribed to certain principles \nand  assumptions  about  what  motivated  people \nand organizations. They operated on the basis of \nassumptions about what caused what and what led \nto what. Or what made people and systems become \neffective. Or what issues mattered more than others. \nTheir perspectives led to views about where to start a \nprocess of capacity development and what to do and in \nwhat order. Each way of thinking, in practice, reflected \ndifferent theories of change and different perspectives \non human nature.\u201d [ 17 ]\nIn some of the cases from the Pacific, the \u201dmental model\u201d was \nclearly based on principles of organizational development. Others, \nas suggested above, drew on aspects of systems thinking, while \nthose seeking to strengthen civil society and local communities \nrelied more on mental models rooted in notions of participation, \nengagement, and empowerment. Donors drew on these various \nmental models in their designs to varying degrees, usually with \nan overlay of bureaucratic planning, emphasizing results-based \nmanagement and performance improvements. These diverse \nrealities reinforce a view of CD as a prism-like phenomenon that \nyields different images depending on how you look at it. \n16   The European Centre for Development Policy Management study (GOVNET 2005) has been \ncarried out under the aegis of GOVNET, the working group on governance and capacity \ndevelopment of the DAC of the OECD. It includes 18 case studies and various theme papers. \n17    Morgan, Baser and Land 2007.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  19", "B. Implementation \n1.  Different Approaches to Capacity Development\nAs the sections above imply, there are various ways to frame \na discussion about approaches to CD. For example, one could \ndraw on the different conceptualizations of CD\u2014institutional \neconomics (supply and demand, incentives), drivers of change \n(power), organizational development, systems or complexity \ntheory, demand-driven approach, instrumental approach (plan \nand control), iterative or emergent\u2014as a way of analyzing or \ndrawing out lessons about strategies or approaches. Another \nway of framing the analysis would be to focus on the nature \nof the inputs. Appendix 4, for example, outlines a range of CD \nintervention options, from provision of advisors to training, \ninfrastructure support, and financing of programming for CD \nprocesses. A third option would be to examine how \u201dcapacity \nstrategies,\u201d explicit or otherwise, played themselves out in the \nvarious cases, in relation to the level of intervention (individual, \norganizational, sectoral). The next section provides a blended \napproach, looking partly at CD approaches by intervention level, \nwhile also focusing on different mechanisms or strategies that \nwarranted particular attention. \na.  enhancing Individual Skills and Competencies \nIn the early days of development assistance in the Pacific, \nconsiderable emphasis was placed on development of individual \nskills and competencies through scholarship programs, work \nplacements, study tours, and other means. As noted in one of the \ncase studies: \u201cSamoa has been generously supported for human \nresources development by the New Zealand scholarship scheme, \nwhich has been operating non-stop since it started some sixty \nyears ago, and by the Australian scholarship scheme which is \nnow approaching 30 years\u2019 continuous operation.\u201d [ 18 ]\nThe Samoa case goes on to note that human resources development \nhas remained \u201ca core driver for public agency involvement with \naid-funded development schemes,\u201d providing opportunities that \nhave directly benefited individual public servants. \n18 Solofa 2007b. p. 14.\n 20  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "wItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent", "Commitment to human resources development is reflected in \nseveral of the cases, with some being more successful than others \nin ensuring that benefits accrue not only to the individuals \ninvolved but their home organization as well.  \nThe case study, Revamping the Cook Islands Public Sector: \nRightsizing,  Enhancing  Skills  and  Changing  Attitudes [ 19 ], \nexamines  attempts  to  enhance  individual  skills  through \ntraining, although within a broader economic and governance \nreform process. As the title suggests, the case focuses on CD \ninterventions linked to the rightsizing [ 20 ] component of the Cook \nIslands\u2019 economic reform program, which was undertaken in the \n1990s. The interventions included training and skill upgrades \nto facilitate a shift for individuals either to the reformed public \nsector or the private sector.\n The Cook Islands case highlighted some of the opportunities as \nwell as risks of CD programming that focuses on the needs of \nindividuals. On the positive side, it underscored the potential for a \nwell-targeted training program to contribute to a broader reform \nagenda. It did this by focusing on specific skills required under \nthe public service reform process, such as performance-based \nmanagement, and by engaging a critical mass of mid- to senior-\nlevel staff in a well-regarded training program (the executive \ndevelopment program of New Zealand\u2019s Massey University). As \nimportant as the new skills though, was the shift that it effected \nin the \u201dculture of governance\u201d in the Cook Islands administration. \nAt the same time, the case demonstrated how the benefits of \nsuch programs risk fading over time as \u201dreform fatigue\u201d sets in, \nkey leaders move on, and the conditions that drove the initial \nreforms slip down the government agenda\u2014in other words, the \nchallenge of sustaining the capacity transformation. \nThe case also raised questions about the extent to which the human \nresource focus should have been on individual competencies or \nstrengthening local institutional capacity to provide relevant \ntraining to Cook Islanders on an ongoing basis. As noted in the \ncase, while the initial focus was on key individuals from the \nCook Islands Government, there was recognition over time of the \n19   Wichman, 2007b.

This was done \neventually through an arrangement with the University of the \nSouth Pacific.  \nThe case study on legal sector reform process in Vanuatu also \nhad a strong, although not exclusive, focus on individual skills \nrequired within the sector to support a broader sector reform \nprocess. Once again, the case underlined some of the advantages \nof situating human resource efforts in a broader reform process, \nbut also showed how capacity gains can be limited by institutional \nconstraints, including difficulties, in Vanuatu\u2019s case, in retaining \nprofessional staff. \nBox 1: Does training work?\nMark Nelson of the World Bank Institute explores this question \nin a 2006 Capacity Development Brief, which examines donor-\nsponsored training programs. As Nelsons notes, \u201cthe dominant \nfinding of most evaluations of training in a development context \nis that it has proved less effective than expected.

February.\nSamoan case writer Esekia Solofa acknowledged the need for \nongoing human resource development in Pacific countries, such \nas Samoa, but the challenge according to him is how to turn such \nindividual capacity transactions into sustainable organizational \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  23", "capacity transformations. [ 21 ] This issue is discussed in subsequent \nsections. \nA related issue in several cases was the appropriateness of \ntraining in the given context. In some instances, the focus \nwas ensuring that training materials were relevant to the local \ncontext. The Cook Islands case offered a positive example; case \nstudy material for the program with Massey University was based \non local experiences identified by Cook Islands participants. In \nother cases, the focus was the relationship between the level of \nthe training materials and the capabilities or knowledge base of \nparticipants. The latter was noted in several cases of training \nprovided for local leaders. As a local consultant cautioned in \nthe Tuvalu Trust Fund case: \u201cinternational agencies need to step \nback from international best practice and pitch advice at a level \nappropriate to the recipients.\u201d [ 22 ]\nb.  Strategies for effective use of existing Capacity\nRather than relying on training, some cases revealed strategies \naimed at unlocking or making better use of existing capacity, \nusually relying on human resource management tools and \nstrategies. As with the training examples above, these cases \nhighlighted the possibilities as well as the limitations of addressing \ncapacity constraints or leakage through such means. \nPay reform was one option employed in several cases to try to \nensure staff would not leave government for \u201dgreener pastures,\u201d \nincluding staff who had already been trained through government \nand/or donor-funded programs. This strategy worked to varying \ndegrees, depending on the specific incentives the government was \nable to offer and how they compared to opportunities outside the \npublic sector. In some cases, there seemed to be an expectation \nthat loss of public servants was all but inevitable, and that those \nwho left would simply be replaced by the next generation of \ngraduates, who would gain quality, entry-level work experience \n21   The United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development publication (DFID 2006), \nHow to Provide Technical Cooperation Personnel, distinguishes between initiatives that are \ntransactional in nature, e.g., \u201cto help a state or private sector organisation to establish new \nsystems and technology, and deliver specific outputs\u201d and others that are \u201cmore ambitious \nand transformational \u2013 to support the organisation\u2019s sustainable capacity to deliver its main \noutputs in the future.\u201d\n22    Bell 2007. p. 12.\n 24  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "that would, in turn, be followed by their departure from the \npublic service. \nIn the Tongan health management case, the author described how \nthe project harnessed the ministry\u2019s capacity through effective \nuse of workshops, on-site discussions, interactive meetings, and \nuse of committees and working groups with staff from relevant \nareas. This was referred to as \u201ddeveloping Tongan solutions to \nTongan problems\u201d [ 23 ] and was seen as one means of trying to \nmotivate and make better use of existing staff.\nOther cases, described further below, displayed how a strong \nsense of ownership or commitment to a cause (for example, \nimproved water and sanitation) among local stakeholders, or \nthe creation of a more positive work environment by employers, \ncreated better conditions to retain and use local capacity.  \nThe few examples described above, along with the training \ncases, illustrate two important points. First is that training and \nstrategies to make better use of existing capacity, such as pay \nreform, are necessary but usually insufficient by themselves to \naddress broader capacity challenges. Second, the experiences \nunderline how institutional disincentives and weaknesses in \nhuman resource planning and management capacity\u2014including \nhow to assess needs, use TA effectively, and link human resource \ninterventions to broader reform processes\u2014can further limit the \ncontribution of training or human resource reforms to sustainable \ncapacity changes.   \nc.  gap Filling \nAbsolute gaps in specific capacity areas are an ongoing challenge \nfor some Pacific island countries, given weaknesses in education \nsystems and sometimes mobile populations, such as in the Cook \nIslands and Republic of the Marshall Islands. These countries \nare vulnerable, in capacity terms, quite often in areas of high \nstrategic importance, such as trade negotiations, anticorruption \nand money laundering, and telecommunications. In these \ncircumstances, evidence suggests that \u201dtraditional\u201d CD strategies, \nsuch as training public servants, may not be the optimal strategy, \nor may need to be combined with other approaches.  \n23   See Tonga Health Sector Planning & Management Project - Phase II - Project Design Document \n- AusAID & Government of Tonga, March 2001. p. 9.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  25", "Rather than allowing these gaps to shut down a whole system, \ngap filling is often used to ensure continuity in the system. A \n2005 review of the Commonwealth Secretariat\u2019s Strategic Gap \nFilling Program [ 24 ] noted the different approaches\u2014each of which \nwas seen as having merit in light of the prevailing capacity \nsituation\u2014taken by long-term advisors under that program. They \nincluded \n\u2022\t operational gap filling (sometimes with secondary \nresponsibilities  for  skills  transfer  or  systems \ndevelopment);\n\u2022\t assuming an advisory role (e.g., on strategic policy or \nprogramming priorities); and\n\u2022\t mentoring and/or skills transfer role (time limited from \na centralized or regional base), including \u201cin and out\u201d \nmentoring. \nGap filling in this sense is different from the often criticized \nscenario where expatriates assume roles that could otherwise be \nfilled by national actors. Nevertheless, gap filling is still criticized \nfor not responding sufficiently to long-term capacity needs or \ndoing enough to break cycles of dependency on external expertise. \nThe Commonwealth Secretariat review found that the gap-filling \nassignments were not always clear on counterpart arrangements, \nor where they belonged in broader capacity-building strategies. \nHowever, the report also found that if properly designed, gap-\nfilling TA can contribute to CD, particularly if it is tailored to the \nparticular needs of the beneficiary country. And by responding \nto strategic priorities at key junctures, it can reduce a country\u2019s \nvulnerability and provide a stronger base for use of existing \ncapacity in the country. [ 25 ]\nThe need for ongoing gap filling in the Pacific reflects the \nreality that many countries in the region are not able to either \ndevelop or retain the skills they require, the net result being \nthat they either have to buy the skills on international markets, \n24   The review was undertaken by the European Centre for Development Policy Management and \nincluded a review of the Commonwealth Secretariat\u2019s program in the Pacific.\n25  Examples of this include a \u201dgap-filling\u201d trade policy adviser enhancing the potential for small \nto medium-size entrepreneurs to function effectively under a new trade regime, or advisors \nto national law offices increasing the capacity of local officers to address money laundering \nissues. \n 26  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "rely on technical assistance provided by donor agencies, or do \nwithout. Gap filling, as a phenomenon, also reflects increasing \nglobalization, with skills being transferred regularly across \ninternational borders. In that sense, all countries, industrialized \nor other, engage in gap filling. \nThe term gap filling was not used in any of the cases covered in \nthis study. However, some of the TA interventions were consistent \nwith the description above. For example, as detailed further \nbelow, the advisor to the ADB-sponsored Republic of Marshall \nIslands (RMI) fisheries project became involved in marketing of \nRMI as a destination for investment on behalf of the Government \nand took part in negotiations on the Government\u2019s behalf. These \nactivities were beyond his terms of reference but reflected the \nacknowledged and strategically important weaknesses in the RMI \nGovernment. This \u201dgap filling\u201d provided an opportunity for the \nGovernment to address issues that would lead to more effective \nuse of capacity in the country\u2019s private sector. In the Solomon \nIslands infrastructure development case, the consultants provided \ntraining and advisory support, but also took an active role in \nimplementation, partly due to capacity gaps in the ministry in \nthe aftermath of the recent conflict. The implications of this \napproach in a post-conflict scenario, such as Solomon Islands, \nare discussed further below. [ 26 ]\nd.  Supporting organizational Capacity Development\nThe Tonga health management case is an example of a TA \nproject focused primarily on organizational-level capacity issues, \nspecifically in the country\u2019s Ministry of Health (MoH). The case \nstudy describes how pressures on the health care system had \nintensified over years leading to the determination that the \u201dcore \nproblem\u201d was a need for improved planning, management, and \ncoordination in the MoH. It was anticipated that the proposed \nchanges would strengthen the ministry\u2019s planning, human \nresource management, training, and communications, as well \nas work practices, procedures, performance measurement, and \nmonitoring. The last mentioned, in turn, would help to identify \nsolutions to difficulties faced in specific areas, such as medical \nrecords and procedures for patient admission, transfer, and \ndischarge. \n26 For more on gap filling and other approaches to TA, see Land 2007.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  27", "The project had three phases. The first involved intensive \ndiagnosis of capacity issues in MoH and assessment of MoH\u2019s \nabsorptive capacity for changes proposed for the next phase. The \nsecond phase built on activities from the first phase, extending \nthem to the division and section levels, and the third phase \nfocused on consolidation of achievements and development of \na model that other government agencies could use. \nAccording to the case study author, Kaveinga Tu\u2019itahi, the \npositive achievements could be attributed, in large measure, to \nthe management team and the conditions they provided for the \nchange process. The case speaks to \u201ctheir vigilance in addressing \nthe various challenges and taking a clear visionary and focused \nstrategic approach to the tasks they face.\u201d [ 27 ] Much of the credit \nwas given to the minister who was described as \u201cyoung and \nopen to meaningful change\u201d and who put \u201cthe full weight of his \noffice\u201d behind the initiative. The importance of leadership, vision, \nand senior-level support to organizational change processes, \nincluding efforts to address capacity issues, is a theme that also \nemerged in other cases and is addressed further in the section \non key success factors. \nThe aforementioned Solomon Islands case study on Reconstruction \nof a Fragile State examines efforts to reestablish the capacity \nof the Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID) after the \nethnic conflict in that country. Once the country was secure, the \nGovernment drew up a medium-term development strategy to \ncontribute to the stabilization and restoration of the economy. The \nplan\u2019s fifth key strategic area was revitalization of the productive \nsector and rebuilding of supporting infrastructure. However, as \nthe case notes, \u201cMID officials believed that before SI\u2019s [Solomon \nIslands\u2019] medium and long term reconstruction issues could be \naddressed effectively, MID\u2019s internal capacity would have to be \nstrengthened.\u201d [ 28 ] This led to a request to the ADB for TA to \nstrengthen the capacity of MID to plan, manage, and finance \ninfrastructure development \u201cin a sustainable manner.\u201d Besides \ntraining professional staff, the TA helped the Government prepare \na national transport plan, and establish a transport policy and \nplanning unit, as well as a national transport fund.\n27  Tu\u2019itahi 2007a. p. 4.\n28  Rihuoha 2007. p. 4.\n 28  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "The Solomon Islands initiative was seen as a success in terms of \nmeeting its expected deliverables, but this could be attributed, at \nleast in part, to the significant role played by the advisors, such \nas in developing the plans and designing new organizational \nstructures. However, the case also shows the challenges of taking \non a complex organizational CD initiative in the early recovery \nstage following a conflict. An evaluation of the project noted \nthat while skills were effectively transferred in such areas as \nproject management, the project was less successful in sustaining \nskills in areas where local staff had limited prior experience. The \nevaluation went on to state that \u201cNo evidence can be found that \nany training, either formal or on the job training, was provided \nin the creation of new institutional structures and procedures \nwithin MID\u201d [ 29 ]\u2014something which would seem to be key to \nsustainability.\nSome of the perceived shortcomings in the Solomon Islands \nproject were attributed to an inaccurate assessment of MID\u2019s \ncapacity (including its ability to absorb training) and lack of \ntime provided for follow-up support. The evaluation also \nnoted that the many vacant positions in the ministry after the \nconflict affected efforts to improve MID\u2019s internal capacity, as \ndid the Government\u2019s slowness in recruiting new staff due to a \nrecruitment freeze. \nIn brief, the two cases described above highlight the importance \nof leadership, senior-level support, and enabling conditions to \neffective organizational change. The Solomon Islands case, in \nparticular, also shows the need to assess capacity accurately in \nadvance and to calibrate expectations accordingly, especially \nwhen dealing with post-conflict situations. These themes and \nthe Solomon Islands case are discussed further in subsequent \nsections.\ne.  enhancing Capacity for Sector Reforms\nSector reforms lend themselves to a systems approach to CD, \ngiven the need for coordination and collaboration across \ngovernment systems, and with nongovernment actors. This \nwas the case in the AusAID-funded legal sector strengthening \n29 ADB 2006b. p. 13.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  29", "program in Vanuatu, which tackled issues in the legal sector\u2014\nstaff development, relationship building, administrative reform, \nreview of existing laws and structures, and improvements in \naccommodation for justice sector offices. The program was also \naligned with Vanuatu\u2019s ADB-financed comprehensive reform \nprogram, which included a broader reform agenda covering such \nareas as governance, public sector reform, and private sector \ndevelopment. \nSector reforms, such as sector-wide approaches and CD processes, \nare expected to reinforce or build on host country ownership, \nworking through local institutional structures. However, the \nexperience with the Vanuatu legal sector strengthening program \nand other sector reforms also demonstrates how they can be \n\u201dcapacity-demanding\u201d because of the need for the lead ministry to \nadvance policy and institutional reforms, enhance collaboration \nwith domestic partners, and harmonize with external actors\u2014all \nareas requiring significant capacity that is often in short supply. \nThe ability of the lead ministry to advance reforms can also be \ncompromised by factors in other parts of the system, such as \nremuneration packages for lawyers in the case of legal sector \nstrengthening, which were not seen as competitive enough to \nsustain legal careers in Vanuatu\u2019s public sector. \nIn both RMI case studies (fisheries and youth services), author \nBen Graham noted how ADB collaborated with the Government \nto address capacity issues. The key stakeholders recognized \nthe need to address a spectrum of issues in an integrated \nmanner\u2014simultaneously or sequentially\u2014in order to realize \nthe expected objectives. In the RMI fisheries case, there was an \nexplicit recognition of the need to deal with both policy and \norganizational issues in the sector, reported as \u201ca rethinking of \nfisheries development\u201d that could only be supported by a broad-\nbased, multiyear reform program to deal with the fisheries sector \nas a whole system.\n     \nThe youth project, while not strictly a sector reform program, had \ntwo streams, one of which focused on developing the enabling \nenvironment (policies, strengthening the responsible ministry as \nwell as nonstate actors, and enhancing collaboration among the \ndiverse actors involved). The other focused on \u201dDevelopment \nof Youth,\u201d addressing issues from improved school retention \nrates to enhanced service delivery capacity and engagement \n 30  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "of youth in civic affairs. Similar to the Vanuatu case, a lesson \narising was that while a broad approach to problem analysis and \nintervention design is appropriate, it does not necessarily lead \nto the expected results at the broader systems level, particularly \nif a binding constraint intervenes, such as a capacity gap, a lack \nof commitment, poor relationships among relevant stakeholders, \na disabling policy environment, or any combination of such \nfactors.\nThe difficulties described briefly above reflect the inherent \nchallenges in reforms that involve diverse stakeholders in an \nextended capacity system. They point to the need to invest in \nunderstanding the \u201dsystem,\u201d to identify strategic entry points [ 30 ]\nand appropriate sequencing of inputs, and the need for flexibility \nand capacity to adjust to changing contextual realities\u2014in other \nwords, a clear strategy for CD, including how such inputs as \nTA are used to support it. Providing sufficient time is another \nimportant consideration for sector reforms, discussed further in \nthe section on key success factors.  \nf.  Policy and Institutional Reform \nSome case studies had an explicit focus on policy or institutional \nreforms, usually as part of a broader reform process. The Vanuatu \nlegal sector reforms discussed above, for example, involved \nsupport to strengthen the capacity of key sector institutions \nand to review existing laws to identify priorities for legislative \naction. The latter led to drafting, amending, or passage of key \nlegislation, such as the legal profession bill, criminal procedure \ncode, and penal code. \nIn the Kiribati case study on water and sanitation, there was a \nrecognized need to deal with several issues\u2014community health, \neducation, water supply, sanitation, appropriate technology, \ninstitutional strengthening, and management aspects\u2014in a \ncoordinated approach, including the development of \u201csuitable \nstrategies and policies for addressing the issues.\u201d [ 31 ]\nBoth RMI cases also recognized the need to update or develop new \npolicies to provide an enabling environment for planned reforms. \n30   For example, the RMI youth services case referred to \u201cfollowing the energy\u201d in the system.\n31   Mackenzie 2007. p. 2.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  31", "wItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent", "In the youth services case, this was combined with interventions \nto strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs \n(including the Youth Bureau) and the Marshall Islands Youth \nCongress, and to increase cross-sector collaboration. \nIn none of the cases was support for policy and institutional \nreform described specifically as a \u201dcapacity development\u201d \ninitiative, although in some cases external advisors worked with \nPacific islanders to strengthen policy development skills, usually \nin a learning-by-doing mode. Nevertheless, the experiences point \nto the potential for relying on policy and institutional reform as \na \u201dcapacity strategy\u201d that can provide space for effective use \nof capacity in the local or national context, for example, by \nremoving such constraints as disabling policies, or by reforming \ninstitutions that might otherwise limit reform processes. \n \ng.  Strengthening Interorganizational Collaboration \nThe  AusAID-funded  Provincial  Performance  Improvement \nInitiative (PPII) is a PNG Government initiative (started in 2004) \nled by the Department of Provincial and Local Government \nAffairs (DPLGA) in partnership with Department of National \nPlanning and Monitoring. For AusAID, support to PPII represents \npart of their subnational strategy. The objective of the initiative \nis to improve public administration at the subnational level, but \nit also includes support for national initiatives that affect lower \nlevels of government, such as intergovernmental financing, \nlegal  structures,  coordination  with  provinces,  and  local \ngovernments. \nGiven the nature of the intended reforms, there is a real need to \nstrengthen capacity for interorganizational collaboration at the \nprovincial level, but also in terms of federal-provincial relations. \nIn fact, one of the objectives during the pilot phases was to \n\u201cStrengthen national agency linkages with provincial/district/\nLocal Level Government administrations.\u201d This has led to specific \ninterventions linking national agencies to the provinces working \non service improvement, including consultative forums. AusAID \nsupports this process, in part, by \u201dco-locating\u201d Australia-based \nand locally engaged AusAID staff in key national government \ndepartments and provincial administrations. \nThe PPII is still underway at the time of writing and is likely to \nyield interesting lessons over time, including how to engender \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  33", "or strengthen capacity to collaborate\u2014a particular challenge \nin a context like PNG, with its significant capacity constraints \n(especially at the decentralized level), where the approach to \ndecentralization remains controversial and where incentives \nhave not always favored collaboration. \nIn the RMI youth services case, as noted above, project stakeholders \nrecognized the need for interorganizational collaboration, but \nalso saw weaknesses in government capacity as a potential \nobstacle. A decision was made to designate the National Training \nCouncil (NTC) as lead agency for the reforms. This required an \noverhaul of NTC, including updating legislation, formulating a \nnew strategic plan, hiring a new director, identifying new board \nmembers, and providing organizational strengthening support \nfrom ADB. This was done with an understanding that NTC \nwould continue to operate under the direction of the Ministry \nof Internal Affairs. However, as the case revealed, the Ministry \nof Internal Affairs was not up to the challenge given leadership, \nhuman resource, and other capacity shortcomings. A conclusion \nfrom the case study was that some of the recommendations \nfrom the ADB TA were unlikely to ever be implemented given \nvarious constraints, including the challenge of coordinating the \nagencies required to support improvement of youth services in \nthe country.  \nThe Tonga health management case offers a somewhat more \noptimistic  example  of  interorganizational  collaboration. \nThe Tongan Ministry of Health secured the support of other \nagencies in government, including Ministry of Finance, Central \nPlanning Department, and other key public service agencies, to \nadvance their reforms. Collaboration also relied on policy and \nexecutive committees, as well as human resource training and \ndevelopment committees. As the case study noted, \u201cThis ensured \na wider network for mutual support and essential and effective \nnetworking.\u201d The other Tongan case study, which examined an \nADB TA aimed at enhanced integrated strategic planning, offered \na similar picture; it brought \u201cthe strategic planning process in \nharmony with fiscal planning in the Ministry of Finance,\u201d [ 32 ]\nby enhancing collaboration between the Central Planning \nDepartment and the Ministry of Finance. \n32 Tu\u2019itahi 2007b. p. 5. \n 34  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "h.  Regional Strategies for Capacity Development\nThe vision statement in the Pacific regional plan recognizes \nthe \u201climited capacity and fragile and vulnerable environment\u201d \nof the region\u2019s small island states, leading to a call for more \n\u201cregional approaches to overcoming capacity limitations in \nservice delivery at a national level, and increasing economic \nopportunities through market integration.\u201d [ 33 ] Toward that end, \none of the strategic objectives of the plan is \u201cthe building of \nstrong partnerships with national and regional stakeholders\u2026. \n(including) regional volunteer schemes and other forms of \nregional exchanges for capacity building.\u201d \nOne case study, The Role of USPNet in Capacity Development in \nthe South Pacific Region [ 34 ], was chosen specifically to garner \ninsights on the role of regional institutions in CD in the Pacific. \nAs authors Ron Duncan and James McMaster note, the case \nstudy \u201ctells the complex story of how a regional university has \nchanged its delivery systems for teaching and learning to serve \nthe growing needs for tertiary education of students living on \nthousands of small islands in the Pacific Ocean (including) the \ndevelopment and use of its communications technology system \ncalled USPNet.\u201d [ 35 ]\nThe University of the South Pacific (USP) distance education \nprogram in the region started in 1970, focusing mainly on in-\nservice teachers. By 1976, USP had a total of 90 distance education \nstudents enrolled in 16 courses through four university centers \nand four education departments. By 2006, there were more \nthan 10,000 distance education students (almost half of USP\u2019s \ntotal student population) enrolled in over 200 courses. Initially, \nUSPNet only had voice capacity, but with recent upgrades now \noffers instruction using a multimedia format that has increased \nthe quality of the educational experience for students and helped \nreduce attrition rates. \nThe case study describes how USPNet has contributed to capacity \nat various levels in the region: at USP headquarters, through \n33  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2006. The Pacific Plan includes 21 references to the word \ncapacity, showing its importance. \n34  Duncan, Ron, and James McMaster. 2007.

The case also \nsuggests that USPNet still has considerable untapped potential \nto contribute to strengthening capacity in the public and private \nsector, and to civil society in the region.\nFrom a CD perspective, the case offers interesting insights on \nboth the opportunities and challenges associated with relying on \nregional institutions to address capacity issues. To begin with, \nit reflects what would appear to be an increasing interest in the \nPacific, and elsewhere, in regional or \u201dnetwork-like\u201d responses \nto capacity challenges. Such responses include the South Pacific \nForum, South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme, \nand Forum Fisheries Agency. As suggested in the development \nliterature, [ 36 ] networks, coalitions, and other types of partnership \narrangements are increasingly being relied on to respond to \nsuch complex issues as environmental management, economic \ncooperation, and HIV/AIDS. They also reflect a desire to bring \ncapacity together to respond more efficiently and effectively to \nrapidly changing conditions, something that has been greatly \nhelped  by  advances  in  information  and  communications \ntechnology, including reduced costs. \nThe USPNet case draws attention to some of the capacities \nor capabilities required to make networks work effectively: \nleadership (more \u201ddistributed\u201d than in other organizational \nforms); legitimacy and collective identity; technical capacity; and \ncapacity to manage or serve the network, including facilitating \nparticipatory  approaches,  knowledge  management,  and \nadaptability. It also shows the potential for relying on regional \nmechanisms, knowledge networks, communities of practice, and \nprofessional associations as networks of, or facilitators of, CD. \nThis type of collaborative capacity is particularly important in \nPacific island countries given their weak (or nonexistent) local \ninstitutions, limited skills base, and often mobile populations. \n36 See, for example, Taschereau and Bolger 2007. \n 36  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "i.  enhancing Domestic Capacity to Develop Capacity\nThe research team selected several cases intended to bring to \nthe fore issues relating to the use of TA facilities. One of these, \nSamoa\u2019s Public Sector Improvement Facility, has been completed, \nbut the others (Advisory Support Facility and Capacity Building \nService Centre, both in PNG) had to be put aside as the consultant \nidentified was not able to undertake the work. Nevertheless, some \ncomments are offered below on the two PNG initiatives based on \nreview of relevant material. Examining experiences in the region \nwith TA facilities was seen as important for several reasons: (i) \nTA remains at the core of much CD work in the Pacific; (ii) the \nuse and management of TA, particularly in pursuit of sustainable \ncapacity, continues to be controversial; and (iii) TA facilities \nrepresent an alternative approach to TA, with increased emphasis \non local management and control of TA, including ensuring \nresponsiveness to domestic priorities.  \nAccording to the AusAID design document, the Samoa Public \nSector Improvement Facility was based on a desire to \u201cdesign \na facility appropriate to Samoa\u2019s social and cultural context, \nenvironment and economy that will support the Government of \nSamoa to build the capacity of its public service to implement \nits national development priorities. (It will) \u2026. address priority \nsmall-scale needs in support of economic and public sector reform \nwithin the key GoS public sector agencies.\u201d [ 37 ] The mechanism \nis managed by a facility management unit in the Ministry of \nthe Prime Minister and is supported by a contracted support \nteam. An overarching strategy is to strengthen cooperation \namong public sector agencies involved in public sector reform \nand between those actors and civil society and private sector \ninterests. The facility has been operating for several years. Like \nPNG\u2019s Capacity Building Service Centre (CBSC), discussed below, \nthe start-up years are seen as a transition period that will involve \nenhancing the capacity of the government team to assume full \nmanagement responsibility for the facility over time. \nThe experience to date with the Samoan facility highlights some \nof the challenges associated with establishing such a locally-\nmanaged mechanism. As the case study notes, \u201cthe story of \nthe Facility so far is entirely about building (practically from \n37 AusAID 2004c. p. iv.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  37", "scratch) the capacity of the Samoa government to manage the \nFacility.\u201d [ 38 ] Part of this can be attributed to the fact that the \nfacility is only a few years old. However, the author provides \nother reasons: incorrect assumptions about the capacity of the \nGovernment to run such a facility, lack of skilled and innovative \nleaders and an organizational culture amenable to supporting \nsuch a facility, and emigration, which has drawn away some \nof Samoa\u2019s best and brightest to overseas destinations, such as \nAustralia and New Zealand. \n \nThe CBSC in PNG\u2019s health sector was established in 2005 to \n\u201cimprove the health of all Papua New Guineans by developing \ncompetencies and capabilities of individual, organizations and \nsystems in the PNG health sector.\u201d [ 39 ] It represents a relatively new \nmodality for AusAID: the partnering approach. This approach \nentails joint participation by the Government, AusAID, and the \nCBSC contractor in a charter board and management group \nintended to allow the three parties to share responsibility for \nthe direction and performance of the center, while providing the \nflexibility to adjust its operations to address emerging needs.\nThe CBSC takes a fairly comprehensive approach to capacity \nissues in PNG\u2019s health system, addressing sector-specific needs \n(technical and managerial) at various levels and governance \nand administrative arrangements affecting the sector, while \nsupporting learning about CD innovations. It has also invested in \nprofessionalizing the procedures for recruitment and selection of \nTA personnel, as well as performance measurement of advisors. \nThe establishment of the CBSC itself is also noteworthy, like the \nSamoa facility, as a donor-funded mechanism, supported by a \ncontracting agency that, over the longer-term, is intended to be \nintegrated into the national government. \nAs of 2007, the PNG Advisory Support Facility (ASF) had over 50 \nadvisors working in 22 government departments and agencies or \nsupporting specific initiatives in the country, including the Public \nSector Workforce Development Initiative (PSWDI), Department \nof Provincial and Local Government Affairs, National Economic \nFiscal Commission, National AIDS Council, and Treasury \nDepartment. One difference between the CBSC and ASF is that \n38  Solofa 2007a. p. 13.\n39  Statement taken from Capacity Building Service Centre Charter between AusAID, Papua New \nGuinea Government, and the Australian managing contractor. \n 38  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "ASF is more of a \u201dfree standing\u201d facility that responds to demand \nin many government departments and agencies rather than being \ndedicated or limited to a specific sector. A mid-term review of \nthe ASF noted the following key success factors: \n\u2022\t active, involved board of management;\n\u2022\t a strategic plan linked to government priorities for \npublic sector reform;\n\u2022\t professional recruitment and government selection of \nadvisors;\n\u2022\t comprehensive induction and ongoing support; and\n\u2022\t incentives for quality of advice provided versus \noutputs. \nThe facilities described above are attempts to address the \nimportant issue of TA management, and use of TA for effective \nCD, with local stakeholders in the driver\u2019s seat, from identification \nof need to recruitment, selection, and assessment of performance. \nWhile these facilities show promise\u2014including ensuring greater \nflexibility, responsiveness, and ownership\u2014they also have their \nown capacity issues, as the Samoa case highlights. Questions \nworthy of further exploration as these facilities progress include \nhow effective they have actually been in localizing management \nof TA, reducing dependency on external advisors, and increasing \nthe overall quality of CD processes. \nOther issues that merit further exploration include the different \ngovernance and/or management arrangements and approaches \nused by the facilities, the effectiveness of the \u201dcounterpart \nsystem,\u201d incentives for various stakeholders, and how impact \non the host agency\u2019s capacity is measured.  Finally, it will \nbe important to learn more about how \u201ddemand\u201d for TA and \nCD support is managed, how requests from local partners are \nreconciled with sector priorities, and how capacity is used for \nsustainable benefit. [ 40 ] Positive findings on these and other \nconsiderations would improve the prospects for increasing \nreliance on such facilities for addressing capacity issues in other \nsettings.  \n40  For example, it would be worthwhile to establish a clearer sense of the so-called \u201dfree good\u201d \nsyndrome and whether facilities encourage more critical consideration of the costs and benefits \nof different technical assistance options.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  39", "Village meeting at Serki, South Fly (Source: Ok Tedi Mine CMCA Review - www.wanbelistap.com)", "j.

The overall objective of \nthis AusAID-funded program is to increase the responsiveness \nof the justice system to community needs, including improved \ndelivery of legal and judicial services and law enforcement.

[ 41 ] \nThe case study on this program focuses on the community \njustice liaison unit (CJLU), which was established under LJSP \nto enhance the capacity of PNG civil society and to facilitate its \ninvolvement in policy development and delivery of services in \nthe justice sector. The CJLU emerged from consultations in 2003 \non how to engage civil society and community representatives \nmore effectively in sector planning and implementation.

The project, which took place in \n2005, assisted the Government and people of Nauru to determine \nand prioritize long-term development options. While the key \noutcome of the project was to be a new development plan and \nimplementation strategy, the project team saw the process as \nan opportunity to develop domestic capacity, consistent with \nthe OECD\u2019s statement that a national sustainable development \nstrategy is \u201ca strategic and participatory process of analysis, \ndebate, capacity strengthening, planning and action towards \nsustainable development.\u201d [ 43 ]\nAs the author of the Nauru case noted: \n\u201cThe participatory planning approaches had particular \npower in building capacity because they presumed \nevery citizen\u2019s experience has \u2018gold\u2019 to offer and \nsought to actively \u2018mine\u2019, process and celebrate this \nresource.

In several cases described above, \ninterventions helped to strengthen capacity of local stakeholders \nto advocate or support reforms. However, in some instances this \nwas not matched by capacity or commitment on the supply side \nto respond with equal force.

Each of these is \nlikely to have different consequences in terms of the \u201dlegitimacy\u201d \nof the demands and how, or if, support for them will be sustained. \nIt also raises questions about whose capacity for enhanced voice \nor demand is being developed.\nk.  Financing Mechanisms for Capacity \nStrengthening and utilization \nOne case study, on Tuvalu\u2019s Falekaupule [ 48 ] trust fund (FTF), \nlooked specifically at use of a funding mechanism to support \nCD. The FTF was conceived in the 1990s as a mechanism to \nhelp build capacity for outer island development, building on \nthe experience of the Tuvalu trust fund, which had already \ndemonstrated its worth since 1987.  \nThe FTF was seen as a response to difficulties experienced with \nother development programming modalities. As the case study \nauthor Brian Bell noted: \n\u201cHaving just observed the difficulties of implementing \nprojects under existing modalities it was clear a \ndifferent approach was needed. Donors or central \ngovernment drove the development process. Very few \n47   Balm 2007. p. 6.\n48    Falekaupule: the traditional assembly on the islands.\n 44  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "projects really seemed to take root and be sustainable \nwith the island communities. The usual outcome was \nan initial burst of enthusiasm followed by a gradual \nspiral down of effort and impact once the expatriate \nadvisor had left, central government support faded \naway and the practical difficulties of implementing \nsmall projects in remote, resource poor conditions \ntook effect. People from outside always seem to know \nbetter than those living with the daily issues of island \nlife. The difficulties obtaining spare parts in a timely \nand cost effective way, the lack of key skills, and \naccess to practical advice when needed seemed to be \noverwhelming.\u201d [ 49 ]\nAs Bell noted, there was also very little by way of resources \nand capacity to \u201cbalance up the negatives.\u201d This led to the \nidea of a fund that would \u201cput the power in the hands of the \ncommunity members, where they could decide which projects \nwere funded, and where there was access to skills and advice at \ncritical times to lift the participation and sustainability level.\u201d [ 50 ]\nCommunities invested their savings in the fund (matched by \ngovernment funds), [ 51 ] which provided a significant incentive \nfor local contributions, resulting in a strong sense of ownership \nin fund-related development activities.\nOne lesson from the FTF case was the importance of widespread \neducation programs to ensure understanding of and broad-based \ncommitment to the fund. However, the case also recognized that \nFTF, and other similar funds, are likely to require ongoing TA, \ngiven the significant capacity constraints faced by micro states, \nsuch as Tuvalu. Among the constraints noted was the absence of \ncounterpart staff from the executing agency, some of whom were \naway on long-term training during the project period. Looking \nto the future, the case also identified the difficulties faced by the \nresponsible ministry in retaining staff because of its \u201cperceived \nlack of prestige,\u201d another capacity constraint. \nNevertheless, according to the case author and ADB\u2019s own \nassessment, the program was successful. \u201cThe technical assistance \nachieved its outputs.

Doing it without Donors\nOne of the case studies chosen for this research was selected, at \nleast in part, because it has not involved any support from an \nexternal donor agency. The Star Mountain Investment Holding \nLimited (SMIHL) is a PNG landowner holding company operating \nin Western Province of PNG, in the shadows of the huge Ok Tedi \nmine. The case tells the story of how SMIHL and its constituent \nparts mobilized themselves and enhanced their collective capacity \nas agents for sustainable economic development, drawing on \nthe Lamin Trust, the Future Generation Fund for the mine area \ncommunity.    \nThe initiative evolved out of years of frustration with wasted \nopportunities for economic development in the mine area, \ndespite massive generation of wealth by Ok Tedi. The case study \nattributed these missed opportunities to such factors as lack \nof organizational and economic development capacity in the \nmine community, capture of benefits by local elites, and the \nlack of consensus on how to address the community\u2019s long-\nterm interests. The mismanagement of economic opportunities \nwas discussed with local communities using a bilum (string \nbag) analogy. [ 53 ] As case author Paulina Siop indicated: \u201cThe \ncommunity was told that \u2018there were many holes in their benefits \n- bilum - so there was a need to patch up all the holes so food \ndoes not drop from the holes.\u2019\u201d  [ 54 ]\nSMIHL came into existence following an extensive community \nconsultation process, facilitated by Papua New Guineans, which \ndrew in the three generations of mine stakeholders. Soon after \nits establishment, SMIHL bid on and won a contract; the Tabubil \nSuper Store business became Star Mountain\u2019s first investment. \nAccording to the case study, SMIHL has progressed well since \n52  Bell 2007. p. 18.\n53  A bilum is a traditional string bag used in Papua New Guinea to carry various items, from food \nto babies.  \n54  Siop 2007. p. 8. \n 46  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "Ok Tedi mine    (Source: Ok Tedi Mine CMCA Review - www.wanbelistap.com)\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  47", "wItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n 48  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "then, displaying \u201csolid performances over the last three years.\u201d \nJust a few years after start up, the company is worth \u201cover K7 \nmillion [ 55 ] with three subsidiary companies, and a property \ndevelopment and transport business divisions.

In a community that had no savings and \ninvestment culture and that had developed a general distrust for \nlocal businesses, the consultation approach had to be carefully \nplanned. The community needed to have a sense of ownership \ntoward the program but most importantly take proactive steps \nto change its savings and investment behavior.\u201d [ 57 ] So far that \nobjective seems to have been realized. \n2.  Key Factors Influencing \u201cSuccess\u201d\nThe case studies and the literature reviewed for this report point \nto a number of factors that appear to be common to the more \n\u201dsuccessful\u201d examples of CD. Many of these reflect the \u201daid \neffectiveness\u201d agenda (Paris Declaration and Pacific Principles \nfor Effective Aid). These are explored below, with particular \nattention to how they relate specifically to CD.  \na.  Participation and ownership\nThe case studies and other initiatives covered in this review \ndisplayed  a  relatively  high  level  of  developing-country \nownership at various levels, including key stakeholders and \n55  1 kina = US$0.35.\n56  Siop 2007. p. 11.\n57  Siop 2007. p. 8.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  49", "opinion leaders. This sense of ownership was usually associated \nwith a common vision (often emerging from participatory \napproaches) and coordination among key actors\u2014not just within \nsingle departments or agencies, but across governments and with \ncivil society.  \nAusAID\u2019s institutional strengthening project (ISP) with Vanuatu\u2019s \nMinistry of Finance and Economic Management (not a case \nstudy), for example, was described as being based on a \u201cstrong \nsense from individuals of what they wanted.\u201d The fact that the \nproject was based out of the treasury department, rather than \nbeing run through a project implementation unit contributed to \nthis sense of ownership. A similar sentiment was conveyed in the \nPPII case study, which showed an intent under that program to \n\u201dsupport existing systems and processes and to build on them,\u201d \npartly out of a recognition that introducing new systems would \n\u201cinevitably create dissonances.\u201d  \nThe treasury institutional strengthening project in Samoa \n(AusAID), also not a case study, but linked to other reforms \nbeing studied by case researchers, underlined the importance \nof government capacity to mobilize and coordinate donor \nresources, another important aspect of ownership. According \nto a review of the project, the project also reflected a \u201cdeep \ncommitment to organizational capacity building\u201d on the part \nof the Government of Samoa and a participatory approach to \norganizational reforms. \nAn advisory group review of the Tonga health sector planning and \nmanagement project (AusAID) noted the strong and committed \nleadership from the minister and director (as having) \u201chelped to \nbring about significant change in the management, culture and \nwork practices of the Ministry.\u201d The report also referred to the \n\u201cparallel development of a number of wider public sector reforms \nthat reinforce, and are reinforced by, the project.\u201d \nThe Tongan and Samoan cases described above are both examples \nof the convergence of clear local ownership (from the highest \nlevels), based on a shared vision and sense of ownership and a \npurposeful approach to capacity issues, including recognition of \nthe importance of management and organizational issues and \ninterorganizational collaboration to sector performance (i.e., a \nsystems approach).\n 50  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "Several other examples from a desk review of ADB TA also \nhighlighted the importance of local ownership and broad-based \nparticipation. Under the improving corporate management in \ngovernment services TA (Cook Islands), ADB helped government \nministries, agencies, and outer island councils establish an \napproach to strategy development and business planning. \nThe  commitment  and  ownership  of  various  stakeholders, \neffective counterpart teams, and the regular convening of the \nsteering committee were seen as centrally important in this \ninitiative. Lessons from the project included the importance of \nparticipation from the beginning, sharing ideas, testing ideas in \na nonthreatening environment, and peer reviews. \nIn the strengthening capacity for macroeconomic analysis, \nplanning and policy formation ADB-sponsored TA (Samoa), \nthe Government insisted on a leadership role (the deputy \nsecretary served as team leader), which led to or reinforced \nthe sense of commitment or ownership by local stakeholders. \nThrough this TA, the capacity of the treasury department to \nundertake macroeconomic analysis and policy formulation was \n\u201csignificantly enhanced,\u201d according to the completion report.\nHarmonization is supposed to enhance local ownership in \ndevelopment cooperation processes. As the Cooks Islands case \nstudy on aid harmonization notes: \u201cThe Aid Management \nDivision (AMD) has, in fact, increased its capacity to ensure \nthat the key executing agencies in the Cook Islands are aware \nof their responsibilities vis \u00e0 vis the harmonized program\u2026\n(The) capacity to manage implementation of the harmonized aid \nprogram does not rest solely with the AMD only, but needs to \nbe assumed as well by all implementing agencies\u2014government, \nprivate sector, or NGO. AMD has fostered this broader sense \nof ownership in the aid harmonization process, working with \nthe Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) to support the NSDP \n[National Sustainable Development Plan], and the national \nM&E [monitoring and evaluation] system that the OPM\u2019s Policy \nDivision is designing.\u201d [ 58 ]\nThe PPII also displays a high level of ownership. According to \nthe case study, this has been aided by corporate strengthening \nsupport under the program to DPLGA, which allowed it to \n58 Wichman 2007. p. 14. \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  51", "\u201creinvent itself\u201d and take on \u201centhusiastic leadership\u201d of PPII. \nThis has led to increased support for DPLGA from PNG\u2019s central \nagencies, including higher budget allocations, which is key to \nsustainability of the program. PPII has also displayed a high level \nof local ownership in the approach to CD; PNG stakeholders have \nplayed a central role in the diagnosis of capacity weaknesses and \nthe preparation of CD plans, with the provincial administration \nteam taking the lead in determining what capacity issues are to \nbe addressed and how, in their province.  \nThe significance of developing-country ownership has been \nechoed in many reviews and evaluations, including the 2005 \nInternational Monetary Fund evaluation of technical assistance, \nwhich found, among other things, a strong correlation between \nthe level of ownership and involvement of local authorities in \npreparation of terms of reference. [ 59 ] In the RMI youth services \ncase, Marie Madison, who served with the largest women\u2019s \nnongovernment organization in the country at the time of the \ninitiative, noted that \u201cOne of the good points about the TA project \nwas the consultative exchanges with the youth and community \nmembers. Problem assessment techniques and planning exercises \nprovided for real people (particularly youth) participation.\u201d [ 60 ]\nThe case study on development of Nauru\u2019s national sustainable \ndevelopment  strategy  described  how  a  Nauruan  social \ndevelopment analyst was included on the contract team and \ntwo government officials were appointed to the project out of \nrecognition of the need for local ownership and with a view \nto strengthening internal capacity through the initiative. \nDesignation of the Ministry of Finance as the executing agency \nalso reinforced the sense of ownership, and gave the project team \nhigh-level policy and decision-making access.\nIn the Tuvalu trust fund case, devolving responsibility to manage \nouter island development was seen as key, particularly in light \nof the shortcomings in previous centrally-driven approaches. It \nwas anticipated that such a shift would enhance ownership of \ninitiatives arising from the new trust fund, but as the planners \nrecognized, it would have to be accompanied by a process \nto increase local capacity. Under the fund arrangements, as \n59  International Monetary Fund, Independent Evaluation Office 2005. \n60  Graham 2007b. p. 7.\n 52  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "noted, communities invested their savings in fund-sponsored \ndevelopment initiatives, which further enhanced their sense of \nownership in the fund and associated development activities. \nWhile ownership is uniformly recognized as being central to CD \nefforts, it can also be illusory in the absence of capacity, or where \ncapacity is weak. Despite the generally positive examples cited \nabove, this remains a challenge throughout the Pacific, given the \nfragility of state institutions and, in many instances, the limited \ninvolvement of communities in development processes. In \nrecognition of that, ADB\u2019s 2006 Capacity Development Thematic \nReport [ 61 ] noted a need for ADB to strengthen local ownership \nand leadership and to facilitate change management processes \nmore effectively than it already does. \nThe graphic below offers a simple characterization of the \nrelationship between ownership and effectiveness, with some of \nthe capacity implications cited in Box 3. \nownership\nHigh\nA D\nHigh  High \nownership,  ownership, \nlow  high \neffectiveness effectiveness\nB C\nLow  Low \nownership,  ownership, \nlow  high \neffectiveness effectiveness\nLow\neffectiveness\nLow High\n61  ADB 2006h. \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  53", "Box 3: Capacity Development ownership versus effectiveness\nQuadrant A: High ownership, low effectiveness \u2013 This can be \nthe case at the outset of an initiative when developing-country \npartners have taken a strong interest or leadership role, but do not \nhave sufficient capacity at that stage to translate clear intentions \ninto effective performance.

In the various cases, local champions \nprovided the space, leadership, and legitimacy for processes \nthat led to effective utilization of local capacity or ensured \nthat capacity deficiencies could be addressed in an open and \nsystematic manner. While leaders or champions often came \nfrom the ranks of politicians or senior bureaucrats, they also \ncame from civil society, e.g., nongovernment organizations, \nchurch, or youth leaders whose drive, energy, or vision opened \nup possibilities for addressing capacity issues for the benefit of \ntheir fellow citizens. \nThe Cook Islands donor harmonization case cited above \nillustrates the importance of leadership capacity. In this case, \n 54  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "the leadership provided by the Aid Management Division \n(AMD) contributed to a new vision and development plan for \nthe country, which also positioned that division to assume \nmore of a leadership role in development cooperation issues, \nan important consideration in light of the Cook Islands\u2019 move \ntoward increased harmonization. AMD\u2019s leadership not only \nled the aid reforms but also recognized the necessity of dealing \nexplicitly with internal capacity issues, specifically enhancing \nthe size and capabilities of the AMD for planning and so that \nthey could offer better support to other government units.

This example highlights a distinction between \n\u201dleadership of a cause\u201d\u2014an important role\u2014and leadership that \nis reflective on and able to address capacity issues effectively. \nOften one occurs without the other, but in this case, it was \nthe combination of these two leadership qualities that helped \nexplain AMD\u2019s ability to progress as it did. \nIn the RMI youth services case, government leadership was seen \nas necessary, given the holistic nature of the interventions and \nthe need to engage a range of actors, including nongovernment \norganizations and other nonstate actors. In this case though, \nlack of leadership and political support ultimately diminished \nthe impact of the interventions, despite well-laid plans and \nstrategies. \nLeadership manifested itself in different ways. In PPII, the \ncapacity building division of DPLGA serves as \u201dstrategic \nmanager,\u201d while PPII\u2019s steering committee \u201dled\u201d by bringing \ntogether national agencies and provinces. PPII also actively \nencourages  provincial  leadership  through  the  provincial \nmanagement teams. Several other cases highlighted how a \ngenerational change in leadership opened the door to new \nideas and thinking in the country, creating a more enabling \nenvironment for change.\nSome case studies also highlighted the importance of domestic \ncapacity to develop a clear and shared vision to effectiveness of \nCD efforts. The Cook Islands case on Harmonizing Aid Delivery \nin the Cook Islands, Making things simpler? [ 62 ] tells that story \n62   Wichman, V. 2007a. Harmonizing Aid Delivery in the Cook Islands, Making things simpler? \nManila: Asian Development Bank. (Draft)\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  55", "from the perspective of Garth Henderson, director of AMD. As \ndescribed in the case: \n\u201cThe organizational landscape in the AMD was fairly \nrugged at the time. For one thing, Garth had to come \nto terms with the fact that the Division was poorly \nresourced, in terms of staffing, equipment and technical \nsupport. There was also a low sense of ownership of \nthe aid programs in the country; limited capacity in \nnational and sector planning, and project analysis \nand implementation; no shared national vision due \nto repeated changes of government, poor integration \nwith  other  agencies  of  government  involved  in \nimplementing aid projects; political interventions \nat inappropriate stages that influenced delivery of \nprojects; and under expenditure throughout the aid \nprograms.\u201d \u2026 \u201cTo develop this capacity within the AMD, \nand with partner agencies, he believed it important \nthat a national vision and shared sense of direction be \ndeveloped by all stakeholders\u201d\u2026\u201cThis realization led to \nthe National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP), a \ndocument that \u201clays out the country\u2019s overall direction \nand priorities for development (and, therefore, national \nand aid funding).\u201d Garth saw this plan as \u201ca step in \nthe right direction that will dramatically improve the \nextent to which we plan and implement development in \nthe future. As he stated, \u2018We cannot effectively engage \nwith donors unless we know where we are going. NSDP \nis a start\u2019\u201d. [ 63 ]\n \nc.  Capacity to Demand \nThis section explores the role of developing-country actors \nin articulating and shaping demand for change. Of particular \ninterest are (i) cases in which CD initiatives came about as a \nresult of \u201ddemands\u201d of local stakeholders, and (ii) initiatives \nthat focused explicitly on enhancing local capacity for demand, \nsuch as through support for nongovernment organizations or \ncommunity-based groups. \nThe community justice liaison unit (CJLU) in PNG, as noted \nabove, is still in its early stages, but offers some insights on \n63 Wichman 2007a. p. 6, 7, 10. \n 56  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "the possibilities of increasing civil society capacity for demand, \nservice delivery, and advocacy, especially in the context of \nbroadly-based ownership of a reform process and shared interests \namong civil society and government actors. \nSeveral of the ADB TAs reviewed for this study yielded other \ninsights on the potential for externally-funded TA to enhance \ndomestic capacity for demand. The ADB TA for Kiribati - \ncommunity development and sustainable participation, 2002\u2013\n2005, for example, was complementary to an ongoing ADB \nloan to support improvements in sanitation, public health, and \nenvironment. The TA concentrated on mobilizing community \nsupport and is described in the case study from Kiribati \u2013 A Tale \nof Two CDs [ 64 ], which notes that the first generation of water and \nsanitation (WATSAN) reforms in the country\u2014which had focused \nmainly on hardware\u2014had fallen short of expectations. However, \nthe next generation of interventions, which are covered in the \ncase study, brought in the community participation component \nthat the Government of Kiribati had come to recognize as key \nto sustainability. The second generation of interventions was \nsupported by ADB-sponsored TA projects, which sought to \ninstitutionalize community participation in Kiribati\u2019s WATSAN \nefforts. The interventions involved consultations with 75 \ncommunity groups and improving their capacity to address \ncommunity issues and to influence attitudes and behavior \nregarding WATSAN issues.  \nIn RMI, the ADB-funded TA, preparing the youth social services \nproject, 2004\u20132005, assisted the Government to refocus policies \nand expenditures on priority issues affecting youth. It also \nactively encouraged demand for youth-specific services, through \nparticipatory workshops and use of the media to raise awareness \nof relevant issues. The TA completion report highlighted the \nimportance of participatory processes and the provision of \nkey staff by government. The initiative was described as \u201can \nexample for the region\u201d and the case study highlighted how the \nTA intervention helped civil society actors and youth articulate \ntheir interests and demands for change. \nThe desk review identified an example in PNG that highlights \nthe experience of a national affiliate of an international \n64   Mackenzie, Ueantabo. 2007.

With support from the \nEuropean Union, WWF PNG has supported local communities \ninterested in setting up wildlife management areas (WMAs). \nIn the PNG context, landowners need to secure the permission \nof the Minister of Environment and Conservation to set up a \nWMA. WWF is authorized to work with communities that have \nexpressed an interest to do so, and once the WMA is gazetted, \nWWF actively supports the community\u2019s efforts to protect \nwildlife and to support environmentally sensitive economic \ndevelopment activities.\nThe interesting aspect of the WMA process from a CD perspective \nis the \u201c10 Steps for Landowners.\u201d Through a 10-step process, the \nwhole community chooses the type of conservation area they \nwant. They establish an agreement among themselves, decide \non rules and sanctions and a wildlife management committee, \nbefore asking the government to declare a WMA. The process is \none of community empowerment; WWF supports the process of \ndecision making, disengaging as appropriate when communities \nneed to make decisions on their own, and then re-entering when \nthe communities have decided on the type of support they want \nfrom WWF. WWF\u2019s role is recognized by the Government and the \nWMA is sanctioned under national legislation, giving legitimacy \nto the process.    \nd.  Relevance, Readiness, and Receptivity \nSome cases highlight how \u201dsuccess\u201d was more likely when \nexternal CD interventions were linked to processes and priorities \nseen as highly relevant by local stakeholders. For example, the \n2005 AusAID technical advisory group review of the Tonga health \nsector planning and management project (1999\u20132007) underlined \nthe importance of its project design, which focused on \u201cthe \nneeds identified by the Ministry of Health staff themselves.\u201d The \nTuvalu trust fund and the Kiribati revenue equalization reserve \nfund were also seen as relevant by local stakeholders because \nthey helped to secure much needed long-term public sector \nfinance. Similarly, CD in the Nauru case study was aligned with \ndevelopment of their national sustainable development strategy, \na centrally important planning document for the country. While \nidentifying \u201drelevance\u201d as an important success factor may \nseem self evident, the apparent lack of commitment by local \n 58  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "wItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\nwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent", "stakeholders in some initiatives suggests that relevance needs \nto be validated, for example, through participatory consultative \nprocesses, rather than assumed. \n\u201dAppropriateness\u201d is another success factor that may seem self \nevident, i.e., making sure that CD inputs match development and \ncapacity needs, whether it be technical advisors, institutional or \npolicy support, linkages, or twinning arrangements. What the \ncases show, as does the CD literature, is that interventions need \nto be appropriate in the given country or community context. \nIn other words, context (in all its meanings) matters greatly. \nConsequently, there can be no blueprint for CD, no \u201done size fits \nall.\u201d This means that the key features of the programming context \n(such as policy environment, relationships among stakeholders, \ncapacity strengths and shortcomings, and political economy \nfactors) need to be captured during assessment processes. \nNevertheless, designs for CD interventions are still often overly \nambitious and assumptions about capacity or the project context \nare wrong, resulting in few sustainable achievements. Even many \nof the \u201dsuccesses\u201d reviewed for this study highlighted concerns \nabout sustaining capacity gains realized during the course of the \ninvestment, in part due to inadequate initial analysis of relevant \nfactors.  \nThe case studies also point to the importance of readiness or \nreceptivity as a precondition or enabling factor for effective \nCD. Much of this relates to, or is rooted in, some of the points \ndiscussed above\u2014ownership, the existence of local champions, \nor effective demand. In Vanuatu\u2019s institutional strengthening \nproject with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management, \nthe emphasis in the initial stage on stakeholders\u2019 becoming \nfamiliar with each other enhanced organizational readiness to \nchange. The combination of organizational readiness, enabling \nfactors (e.g., the existence of appropriate legislation), ensuring \nsufficient time for the initiative to unfold, and provision of valued \ninputs in this case led to an upward virtuous cycle of change \nthat included increased confidence in the Government among \nexternal stakeholders and resulted in direct budgetary support \nand funding through the Millennium Challenge Account.\nIn several cases, readiness or receptivity to change was increased, \nor even provoked, by the onset of a crisis (political, economic, \nor climate-related). In these cases, the crises appeared to open \n 60  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "up space for thinking about things differently. In the Cook \nIslands, for example, the Government was headed toward an \neconomic crisis in the mid-1990s, which provided the impetus \nfor the economic reform program that followed. However, the \ncase writer invoked a biblical story, cautioning that \u201cthe seed \nthat falls on rocky ground will not grow properly,\u201d suggesting \nthat while the crisis provided the opportunity, it did not really \nconstitute ideal circumstances for enduring benefits. \nThe RMI fishery reforms were also borne out of a crisis in the \nsector that led to sector stakeholders recognizing that fundamental \nchanges were required. This led to the changes described in the \ncase study, but in this instance, the reforms have largely been \nsustained due to the real and measurable improvements in the \nsector, and leadership capacity that has driven the process over \nan extended period of time. \nCrisis or not, the cases suggest that relevance, readiness, and \nreceptivity to change are important factors meriting attention \nat  the  outset,  particularly  in  fragile  states  with  limited \nplanning, management, and technical capacity, significant \ninstitutional constraints, political tensions, civil unrest, and \nweak economies. \ne.  Investing in understanding\nThe case studies provided substantial evidence on the importance \nof understanding the programming context\u2014a constant theme \nin the CD literature. This point was brought home in the RMI \nyouth social services case: \u201cA large part of the TA was spent up \nfront on the situation analysis. This analysis brought together a \nsubstantial amount of information which related to youth issues \nand the research was enhanced by information collected through \nthe participatory workshops.\u201d [ 65 ]\nSimilarly, the development of the Nauru Sustainable Development \nStrategy was grounded in a broadly participatory process that \nimproved understanding of community aspirations, while \nstrengthening their capacity to be active participants in such \nprocesses. \n65 Graham 2007b. p. 7.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  61", "As suggested earlier, investing specifically in understanding \ncapacity issues was less apparent in the cases, being a significant \nfeature only in those initiatives with a clear CD mandate, as in \nPPII and the TA facilities in PNG.  \nf.   getting the Incentives Right\nIncentives and motivations played a significant part in several \ncase studies. Incentives generally refer to such measures as salaries \nor indirect benefits (scholarships, access to training programs, \nsubsidized housing, etc.), but can also include less tangible \nbenefits, such as recognition for performance or provision \nof a positive, affirming, and professionally rewarding work \nenvironment. Individuals in some case studies were also motivated \nby less self-interested considerations, including commitment to \nan organizational goal or broader community interests. The cases \nalso demonstrated the influence of negative motivators, such as \nthe debilitating influence of unstable environments, the absence \nof rule of law, or lack of engagement of civil society, any of \nwhich can undermine capacity or drive it away. \nAs reported in the PPII case, progressive demoralization and \ndisillusionment of provincial administrative staff were significant \ncapacity weaknesses and a risk that had to be addressed. One \nway PPII has addressed the incentives issue at the institutional \nlevel is to make \u201dgraduation\u201d from one phase of the program \nto the next contingent on provincial teams\u2019 meeting specified \ncapacity criteria, such as completion of a capacity building plan, \nor improvement in public administration systems. Incentives \nprovided in the program include up to K250,000 per year for \ncapacity building programs (Phase I) and K0.5 million\u20131.0 \nmillion per annum for infrastructure support (Phase II). \nIn the Kiribati water and sanitation case, stakeholders relied on a \ncombination of public education and mobilization and legislative \nchanges to induce changes in behavior\u2014positive and negative \nmotivators. In this case, the approach chosen was based on a \nrecognition that mobilizing or educating people to \u201ddo the right \nthing\u201d may not always be enough and may need to be combined \nwith sanctions for behavior that goes against public interest\u2014in \nthis case, amendments to the penal code to increase penalties for \npeople who vandalized water and sanitation facilities. \n 62  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "The Tonga health management case highlighted the potential \nlimitations of more altruistic motivations. As noted: \u201cOn \nentry into the service, doctors were slotted into departments \nwhere it was assumed that tending to the needs of patients \nwould be sufficient incentive for them to perform and to stay \nengaged. However\u2026frustration or thirst for further knowledge \nor experiences usually drove them to leave the service either \nthrough retirement, resignation, or migration.\u201d [ 66 ] The Tongan \nGovernment recognized the need to respond or see its medical \ncapacity diminish. According to the case, the Government \nsucceeded by providing refresher courses and rotating young \ndoctors to different locations, which not only exposed them to a \nbroad range of experiences, but also gave them an opportunity \nto acquire valuable management experience. \nOther examples from the cases that have, explicitly or otherwise, \nrelied on incentives or tapped into individual or organizational \nmotivations include using locally-managed development funds; \nproviding local personnel space to use and further develop \nor consolidate their own capacity in the absence of external \nadvisors; encouraging and rewarding local innovation; respecting \nlocal knowledge and traditions; bringing civil society actors into \nthe policy and programming mainstream; and aligning donor \nsystems with those of the Pacific island countries.\nFinally on the issue of incentives, Peter Morgan reminds us of \nthe potential for a disconnection between donors, with their \ntraditional focus on outputs and outcomes, and developing-\ncountry partners that do not necessarily reward or sanction on \nthe basis of predicted, measured results. [ 67 ] Such differences, \nwhich reflect different institutional incentives, can affect \ncollaboration and shared sense of responsibility for results, \nincluding those aimed at enhancing capacity, between donors \nand recipient countries.  \ng.  enabling environment \nAccording to various CD definitions, the \u201denabling environment\u201d \nrefers to the policies, institutional arrangements, attitudes, \nvalues, and other factors in the project or program context \n66   Tu\u2019itahi 2007a. p. 3.\n67   Morgan 2007. p. 4. \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  63", "that can potentially support or detract from CD processes. The \nADB CD framework refers specifically to the \u201dpublic sector \ninstitutional framework\u201d as an important aspect of the broader \nenabling environment. For ADB, this includes poverty reduction \nstrategies and plans, public financial management, subnational \ngovernance, administrative and legislative reforms, and civil \nsociety participation, among other dimensions. The \u201dsuccess\u201d \nof some cases in this study can be attributed, to a considerable \ndegree, to factors in the enabling environment that enabled the \ninitiatives to proceed better than might otherwise have been the \ncase. Many of these factors have already been referred to in the \nsections above and include committed leadership, appropriate \npolicies, organizational readiness, and broad societal consensus \nrooted in participatory processes.  \nInterestingly, the European Centre for Development Policy \nManagement  (ECDPM)  study  on  capacity,  change,  and \nperformance, which included two cases studies from the Pacific \nregion, pointed out that: \n\u201cIt is not always true, as conventional wisdom would \nsuggest, that the \u2018enabling environment\u2019, needed \nto be positive. Organizations in seemingly adverse \nconditions went from strength to strength while those \nin overtly much more favourable circumstances did \nless well.\u201d [ 68 ]\nThis somewhat counterintuitive finding was attributed in the \nECDPM cases to inspired leadership, shared values among \nstakeholders, strong relationships, and incentive systems that \ncontributed to the flourishing of capacity and performance in \nadverse circumstances. The study noted, however, that contexts \nare dynamic and can change, so the relationship between \ncontext, capacity, and performance likewise can be fluid and \nunpredictable. Some ECDPM cases also reflected on the capacity \nof stakeholders to manage or influence the context in which they \noperate and the implications of that for CD efforts. \nThis \u201dcapacity to manage the environment\u201d was evident in \nseveral Pacific cases, examples of which are described above. \nOther cases benefited from a broad reform environment that \n68 Zinke 2006. p. 4.\n 64  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "wItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\nwItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent", " 66  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "provided the enabling conditions for sector- or organizational-\nlevel reforms to proceed, including dealing with capacity issues, \nfor example, RMI\u2019s fishery reforms and Tonga\u2019s health reforms. \nThe Nauru case study also noted the importance of the enabling \nenvironment, which, the author remarked, included institutional, \npolitical, and informal leadership that \u201chelps to give permission \nto the new approach, legitimizes the outputs from the new \napproach, and affirms the outcomes.\u201d [ 69 ]\nh.  Flexibility and Adaptivity \nWhile it may be intuitive to think that \u201dsuccessful\u201d CD efforts \nneed be rooted in clearly structured, systematic approaches, [ 70 ]\nexperience suggests it is not necessarily so. One factor is the \ncomplexity of the issue(s) being addressed\u2014the implication being \nthat change involving a broad set of actors or capacity levels \nis likely to require a more coordinated, systematic approach. \nAnother factor is the stability of the programming environment. \nMost initiatives reviewed for this study could be described as \nsystematic in their approach, although many were also flexible, \nadapting to changing demands and contextual realities as \nrequired.   \nADB\u2019s support for the Marshall Islands fisheries development\nplan used a systematic approach based on up-front analysis, \nsequencing of inputs, and attention to sustainability and the \nsocial dimensions required to ensure broad-based ownership. The \ninitial support was a US$600,000 TA grant for the development \nof the national plan, including an in-depth review of the \nfisheries\u2014institutional analysis, legislation, policies, marine \nresources, and environmental management. The review looked \nin particular at the role of the private sector, commercialization, \nand potential for privatization. The purpose of the follow-up \nTA was to \u201cconvert policy into practice,\u201d such as private sector \nmanagement practices, institutional reform, and a trust fund to \nspread the benefits of the expanding tuna fishery. ADB\u2019s future \nassistance was intended to strengthen public sector governance \nand productivity, increase community participation, and improve \nbasic services. \n69   Balm 2007. p. 20. \n70   By systematic is meant methodical, well-thought out plans and implementation strategies. \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  67", "PNG\u2019s PPII, discussed above, has also taken a systematic approach, \nbuilding on diagnoses carried out during the pilot phase and \nmoving sequentially from one phase to the next based on agreed \ncriteria for advancement. Other initiatives examined as part of \nthis study, including Kiribati\u2019s water and sanitation project, also \nrecognized the value of sequencing capacity interventions and \ndovetailing activities, for example, public education programs \nand infrastructure development. \nWhile the above examples point to the value of systematic \nor structured approaches to CD, other examples from the \ninternational literature [ 71 ] suggest that effective CD is not always \na product of tightly scripted designs. Rather it can be emergent \nand responsive to shifting local dynamics, as well as ongoing \nlearning and adaptation. PNG\u2019s PPII, for example, which \nwas described above as a relatively structured or systematic \nintervention, also emphasizes moving at an \u201cappropriate pace\u201d \n(phased approach), providing \u201dspace\u201d for PNG colleagues to \nwork out issues on their own, and supporting competency \ndevelopment and systemic issues simultaneously, suggesting a \nrecognition of the need to balance structure\u2014including a clear \nvision\u2014and flexibility. \ni.  effective use of technical Advisors \nExtensive reliance on international technical advisors has been \nwidely criticized in the development literature, with critics often \ncharacterizing it as ineffective and expensive. [ 72 ] However, a \n2006 OECD report suggested that \u201c\u2026although heavily criticized, \ntechnical co-operation is not \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 \u2013 it depends on \nhow it is used \u2026\u201d [ 73 ]\nVarious approaches to the use of TA advisors were revealed \nin the case studies. These included long-term advisors, short-\nterm advisors, intermittent advisors, locally based resident \ninternational advisors, regionally based advisors, and local \nadvisors. Some \u201dadvised,\u201d while others trained, mentored, or \nfacilitated; some served as change agents or controllers; some \nfocused on systems development or policy reform, or assumed \nimplementing roles. Some shared international best practices, \n71   See, for example, Morgan, Land, and Baser 2005. \n72   See, for example, Berg 1993.\n73   OECD 2006b. p. 3.\n 68  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "while others worked carefully within local systems to facilitate \nindigenous solutions while helping to improve local capacity. \nIn many cases, it was a combination of roles and approaches \n(see Appendix 4 for a list of different approaches to TA). \nThe international consultants in the RMI fisheries case, for \nexample, were engaged as advisors but over time moved beyond \nthat role. They supported the Government\u2019s privatization \nefforts and negotiation of fishery access agreements; they \nsupported implementation of national policies and strategies, \nand  participated  in  public  hearings,  and  industry  and \nregional meetings. The consultants also became involved in \nmarketing RMI as a destination for onshore investments in \nfisheries, including through overseas visits on behalf of the \nGovernment\u2014initiatives that were seen as opportunities to \nbuild local capacity for marketing. In addition, the consultants \ninitiated a stock taking of the relevant ministry\u2019s strengths \nand weaknesses, an exercise which was institutionalized as an \nongoing board-level activity. According to the case study, this \nbroadening of the advisor\u2019s role was possible because of the \n\u201cstrong level of trust\u201d that had been developed between the \nministry and lead consultant. \nIn the Tongan strategic planning case, among others, the \nadvisors served as change agents or facilitators as much as \ntechnical advisors, exposing local stakeholders to options for \nmoving beyond deeply ingrained practices, such as highly \ncentralized and controlled planning processes, to more open \nand participatory approaches. \nThe Tuvalu case study also talks about the value of relying \non local consultants. Referring to a 2000 UNDP evaluation, it \nindicates: \u201cThe fact that a Tuvaluan carried out the review was \nextremely important as it allowed access to views, information, \nand insights that are extremely difficult to obtain by an ex-pat \nconsultant.\u201d [ 74 ]\nThe literature on technical assistance and CD has a great deal \nto say about the importance of getting the right advisor\u2014the \nright mix of technical capabilities, personal attributes, cultural \n74 Bell 2007. p. 5. \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  69", "sensitivity, and openness to learning. As one source noted in \nthis review: \n\u201cConsultants or advisors need to be culturally sensitive, good \nlisteners, and effective at facilitating change. You do not always \nneed the most highly \u2018qualified\u2019 expert.\u201d \nThis sentiment was echoed in the completion report for ADB\u2019s \nimplementation of state owned enterprise reforms TA in Samoa, \nwhich suggested that technical assistance personnel provided \nfor such interventions must be \u201capt communicators and capacity \nbuilders.\u201d\nOther successes identified in this study also highlighted the \nimportance of such factors as good personal relationships with \nlocal colleagues, solid knowledge of the local or national context, \nability to speak the local language, long-term engagement, and \nan ability to function in an advisory capacity and transfer skills \nwhile leaving space for local colleagues to \u201cget on with their \njobs.\u201d\nLong-term engagement of advisors was noted as a success \nfactor in ADB\u2019s capacity building of the legal sector TA in \nVanuatu, 2001\u20132002. The completion report noted that this \nintervention \u201csignificantly improved capacity\u201d in the state law \noffice and helped cultural change in the legal system. The report \nattributed this to the continuity and quality of the TA provided \n(a retired Queen\u2019s counsel); the fact that the advisor was based \nin-country; and the mentoring approach, which was seen as \nbuilding the confidence of local counterparts. Other interviewees \nalso commented on the value of \u201ccontinuous, ongoing support\u201d \n(versus fly-in, fly-out advisors). \nWhile continuity of advisors was clearly a positive factor in some \ncases, others demonstrated the value of short-term, intermittent \nengagement. In the ADB-funded Kiribati water and sanitation \ncase, for example, neither the team leader nor the specialists on \nthe international consultant team were residents in Kiribati for \nthe full duration of the project. This presented some challenges, \nparticularly given difficulties in communications, but it gave \nthe national coordinator and other local staff space to carry \nout their work with a degree of independence based on agreed \nwork plans. The case study on this initiative also referred to the \nimportance of the relationship between the advisors and the local \npartners, describing it as \u201ccordial and collaborative.\u201d Similarly, \n 70  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "the Nauru case study refers to the intermittent presence of the \nteam leader and development economist, which provided local \nmembers of the project team \u201cspace and opportunity to assume \nresponsibility.\u201d  \nAs various examples above suggest, the effectiveness of TA \ndepends to a large extent on human dynamics. This is shaped, to \na considerable degree, by the personal and professional qualities \nof the advisor. However, much of it also hinges on the extent to \nwhich the process allows indigenous partners to use their own \ncapacity (existing or emergent) to find their own solutions to \ntheir particular challenges. This issue is addressed in Box 4.\nBox 4:   Helping People Help themselves \nFormer Word Bank official David Ellerman, in his book Helping \nPeople Help Themselves, discusses what he calls the \u201chelping \nconundrum\u201d:  \u201chow can an outside party (\u2019helper\u2019) assist those \nwho are undertaking autonomous activities (the \u2019doers\u2018) without \noverriding or undercutting their autonomy?\u201d Ellerman draws on \neight thinkers from different fields (including Dewey, Rogers, \nFreire, and Schumacher) highlighting points of commonality using \na framework of \u201chelpers\u201d trying to provide \u201cautonomy-compatible \nassistance\u201d to \u201cdoers.\u201d The points of commonality he identifies are \nas follows: \n\u0083  help must start from the present situation of the \ndoers\u2014not from a \u201dblank slate\u201d,\n\u0083  helpers must see the situation through the eyes of the \ndoers\u2014not just through their own eyes,\n\u0083  help cannot be imposed upon the doers\u2014as that \ndirectly violates their autonomy, \n\u0083  nor can doers receive help as a benevolent gift\u2014 as \nthat creates dependency, and\n\u0083  doers must be \u201cin the driver\u2019s seat\u201d\u2014which is the basic \nidea of autonomous self-direction.\nSource: Ellerman, David. 2005.

The need for a long-term commitment was reflected \nin the design document which recognized that \u201cattitudinal and \nbehavioural change cannot occur overnight.\u201d\nThe PPII is another example of an initiative with a long-term \nperspective, a projected time frame of 15\u201320 years. The PPII \ndesign also recognized the need to proceed at a pace consistent \nwith the capabilities and absorptive capacity of the provinces and \ndistricts involved. As indicated in the case study: \u201cThe focus and \npace of the CD process in each province is completely dictated \nand controlled by each provincial administration.\u201d [ 76 ] The \ncapacity building service centre in PNG has also taken a long-\nterm view with respect to building capacity of the Department \nof Health and other sector actors. \nHowever, most of the cases reviewed were based on short time \nframes, with expectations for \u201ddeliverable results,\u201d in anywhere \nfrom 6 months to 4 years. In some instances, the time frames \nwere insufficient to address relevant capacity concerns and, \nin the absence of follow-up support, local stakeholders were \nconcerned about sliding back to pre-project conditions.    \nk.  taking a Systems Approach \nAs suggested earlier, the idea of systems thinking has gained \ncurrency in the discourse on CD. A systems approach can \nbe contrasted with what may be described as more linear or \nreductionist perspectives on capacity, i.e., input \u2018a\u2019 leads to \noutput or outcome \u2018b,\u2019 which leads to change in performance \u2018c\u2019. \nAccording to systems thinking, rather than reducing capacity to \nits constituent parts and dealing with them as isolated entities, \n75    Mackenzie 2007. p. 2.\n76    Saldanha 2007. p. 8.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  73", "capacity is seen as emerging from and being influenced by a \nbroader capacity system. Advocates of this perspective suggest \nthat interventions should be sensitive to capacity in different \nparts of the system, including how it evolves over time and, most \nimportantly, the relationships among capacity components. \nADB\u2019s CD framework, for example, is described as \u201ca system\u201d \nwith three main dimensions: organizations, institutions,and \ninterorganization and/or group relations. As noted in ADB\u2019s \nmedium-term framework and action plan, \u201cThe third dimension \nemphasizes systems\u2026the need for various government and \nnongovernment organizations and groups to act in partnership \nto achieve agreed objectives. It focuses on\u2026a system of \norganizations and groups in DMCs that are primarily responsible \nfor achieving certain development objectives.\u201d [ 77 ] The enhanced \nattention to capacity systems parallels an increasing reliance \non broader, more comprehensive approaches to development, \nsuch as sector-wide approaches and program-based approaches. \nIts value is in trying to explain complex systems with multiple \nactors, operating in sometimes unpredictable contexts. \nA number of initiatives reviewed for this study reflect aspects of \na systems approach. Health sector reforms in PNG, for example, \nhave increasingly sought to address governance challenges, \nincluding those relating to decentralization, which are seen as \npotentially constraining sector reforms. This has required active \ncollaboration among health sector actors, central agencies, \nand provincial authorities, and has led to legislative changes \nand the introduction of administrative mechanisms to improve \nPNG\u2019s decentralized system. These system-wide interventions \nhave been done in parallel with individual and organizational \ncapacity-building initiatives with actors within the sector. \n  \nThe UNDP provincial capacity building project in PNG seeks to \nstrengthen national and provincial financial management. As \nwith the health reforms mentioned above, the UNDP project has \nassisted provincial governments with their requirements under \nthe 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local \nLevel Governments (OLPGLLG)\u2014PNG\u2019s key decentralization \nlegislation. Thus, the project is intended to be responsive to \ninstitutional and policy challenges affecting performance at \n77 ADB 2006g. p. 14.\n 74  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "provincial and district levels, in particular those associated with \nthe OLPGLLG. \nExperiences with a systems approach described in this paper \nunderline the need to invest in understanding the \u201dsystem,\u201d \nincluding an appreciation of the dynamics of the capacity \nsystem, possible strategic entry points, and a sense of how inputs \nmight be sequenced.  \nFinally, experience suggests that in embracing a systems \napproach, actors may have to make choices about trade-offs \nbetween the potential for gaining access to new capacities, such \nas through formalizing structures, and the potential for loss of \nownership and flexibility. In other words, the incentives do not \nalways favor such approaches. Program-based approaches, for \nexample, that require collaboration among many actors (sector \nministries, central agencies, nongovernment organizations, \nprivate sector service providers, etc.), have to deal with this \nchallenge on an ongoing basis. Ultimately, the extent to which \nthe program-based approach succeeds may depend as much on \nincentives, leadership, or the quality of personal relationships \nwithin the system as on the formal structures or mechanisms \nthat seek to hold the broader program together.  \nl.   Harmonization, Coordination, and Partnership   \nThe Cook Islands harmonization story tells how government \ncapacity (mainly the Aid Management Division [AMD]) was \nenhanced to support harmonization and alignment with New \nZealand and Australia. As indicated in Box 5, the agreements \nsigned by the three parties had five primary objectives. While the \nCook Islands\u2019 harmonization objectives were not explicit on the \nBox 5:   Cook Islands Harmonization objectives\n\u0083  Reduce workloads of all parties involved. \n\u0083  Refine each government\u2019s focus within the aid management \ndelivery process.\n\u0083  Recognize and implement the aligning of donor policies \nwith Cook Islands\u2019 development priorities.\n\u0083  Contribute to efficiency gains in policy consultation, and \nincrease the scale and flexibility with a larger program.\n\u0083  Increase resources and access to a wider (and more relevant) \nrange of technical assistance.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  75", "issue of capacity, it was anticipated that harmonization would \nhave positive capacity impacts, including reducing demands on \nthe Government\u2019s administrative capacity and helping to make \nmore efficient use of existing capacity. In fact, the case study \nshows that demands on government capacity increased in the \nearly days, which was partly what drove the AMD to push for \nincreased staffing to address the new harmonization agenda.\nUnder the harmonization arrangement, the assistance programs \nwere aligned with national priorities, and both donors adhered \nto the Government\u2019s tendering, contracting, and procurement \narrangements. However, the case study suggests that the partners \nmay have entered into the agreement with different assumptions \nabout collaboration and alignment of systems. As the author \ncommented: \u201cThe environment at the time was flavored by \ndonor concerns about\u2026their own reporting obligations and \naccountabilities to their agencies and parliaments.\u201d [ 78 ] Ultimately, \nthis meant that introducing the new initiative as a pilot was \na good idea because it allowed the parties to learn from the \nexperience and adapt over time. \nFrom a capacity perspective, the aid harmonization pilot provided \nthe impetus for the Government and, in particular, the AMD to \ninnovate and to gain the knowledge and wherewithal to \u201cturn \nthings around in an agency that had been reactive rather than \nproactive, and to enhance its capacity so that it could take on \na leadership role in aid management and coordination issues \nin the country.\u201d [ 79 ] The case concludes: \u201cIn the process, AMD\u2019s \ncapacity to lead reforms in the area of development cooperation \nhas been enhanced. Whether they can be sustained will be a \nstory for another day.\u201d [ 80 ]\nThe AusAID-funded Fiji health sector improvement program \n(FHSIP) (not one of the cases for this study) highlights the \npotential for different ways of collaborating with developing-\ncountry partners under AusAID\u2019s partnering arrangement. The \nexpectation articulated in FHSIP\u2019s request for tender (RFT) was \nthat the program would be developed following the Ministry of \nHealth (MoH) plans and relying on MoH leadership. As stated \nin the RFT: \u201cAs far as possible, the structure and function of \n78  Wichman 2007. p. 15.\n79  Wichman 2007. p. 15.\n80  Wichman 2007. p. 15. \n 76  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "Program arrangements will follow the Fiji management structures \nand organizational relationships\u201d. [ 81 ] Consistent with this intent, \nthe current program director is a Fijian who was selected jointly \nby the various program partners and who is permanently based \nin the MoH head office. This approach is consistent with the \nPacific Aid Effectiveness Principles, specifically a call for \u201cuse \nof local systems\u201d and reliance on TA that \u201censures that capacity \nis built with tangible benefits to the country to support national \nownership.\u201d \nThe Kiribati water and sanitation case offers an example of \ncountry-level cooperation and its potential for harnessing the \ncapacity of actors with shared interests. The case study describes \nhow  various  water,  waste  management,  and  community \ndevelopment projects worked closely together, eventually forming \nthe Kiribati Te Boboto (Make Kiribati Beautiful) Coalition: \u201cThe \ncombined efforts of these various projects have contributed \nto building the capacity of individuals and households to \nbetter understand and manage their wastes\u2026.The result of the \ncombined efforts has (also) been very visible in the general \ncleanliness of South Tarawa and the virtual disappearance of \nrecyclable cans.\u201d [ 82 ] One of the local stakeholders noted that: \n\u201cCDSP (the ADB-funded intervention) was very good at being \nopen to working with others in the community working in the \nsame issues area. Many projects can be insular, protecting their \nown turf, but the monthly meetings of the stakeholders provided \na good place for wider input (which) resulted in a much greater \ncollective output than otherwise.\u201d [ 83 ]\nVarious capacity lessons can be drawn from the preceding \nexamples. By coming together through different types of \ncollaborative mechanisms, the initiatives were able to \n\u2022\t minimize competition and duplication, and optimize \nuse of available capacity; \n\u2022\t share experiences, knowledge, and resources; and\n\u2022\t build up collective capacity to affect change.\n81   JTA International 2005. p. 3.\n82  Mackenzie 2007. p. 6.\n83  Mackenzie 2007. p. 6\u20137.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  77", "m.   Political economy Considerations\nFor some analysts, political economy considerations are central \nto explaining the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of development \ninterventions in low-income countries. Political economy \nfactors include social and political structures and behaviors, \nsuch as clientelism, patronage, and \u201dstate capture\u201d by local \nelites. These practices are often deeply entrenched and can \nseriously circumscribe reform efforts or attempts to develop or \nuse capacity. Political economy considerations were a factor to \nvarying degrees in the case studies prepared for this broader \nstudy, such as clientelism and the wantok system [ 84 ] in PNG, \nfaaSamoa (Samoan culture and way of seeing the world), and \nthe matai system, which is Samoa\u2019s political tradition whereby \npolitical leadership is vested in community elders.  \nAs the preceding description suggests, political economy \nconsiderations are often linked to traditional power systems \nor attempts to adapt them in a \u201dmodern\u201d context. As Turnbull \nnotes: \n\u201cIt is not the structure of the state that is the main \nimpediment preventing it (from) improving the living \nstandards of ordinary Solomon Islanders. It is the \nway that practices based on the power relationships \nand means of social control practiced in traditional \nsocieties pervade the state today. Solutions need to \nbe found to several problems. There needs to be ways \nof 1. avoiding the unchecked self-interest within the \nstate at all levels; 2. reducing the time and energy that \nindividuals spend on ensuring their political survival \nrather than on implementing policies for development; \nand 3. establishing a pattern of long-term cooperation \nbetween the state and various communities so that \nthey can work towards mutual development\u201d. [ 85 ]\nPartly because many Pacific island states are still relatively \nyoung, they are faced with the challenge of managing tensions \nbetween modern state institutions and traditional customs \nand institutional arrangements\u2014the latter frequently having \n84  Wantok literally means \u201done language\u201d in pidgin, but more generally refers to the set of \ntraditional customs and obligations associated with being a member of a social group.\n85  Turnbull 2002. p. 200.\n 78  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "greater legitimacy and influence. As suggested in a number \nof the cases, this has implications for the functioning of the \nstate in these countries and efforts to strengthen their capacity. \nIt also underlines, once again, the importance of investing in \nunderstanding the context before engaging in CD processes. \nThis includes understanding traditional culture and informal \npower arrangements, as well as their relationship to more formal \nstructures and processes in society.    \n3.  Capacity Challenges in the \nPacific \u2013 what is Different?\nBefore focusing on what is different about the Pacific, it is \nworth acknowledging the capacity challenges that Pacific island \nstates share with other developing countries. These include \nweak institutions, uneven policies, and limited availability of \nhighly skilled and economically productive human resources. \nCollectively, these are represented in the largest, outer portion \nof the diagram below (Figure 2). \nFigure 2: Capacity Issues: universal to Pacific-specific\nPacific-specific \nCapacity Issues  \nCapacity Issues \nSpecific to Small Island \nDeveloping States \nCapacity Issues Generally \nAffecting Developing \nCountries \nAside from these shared challenges that are, more or less, common \nto developing countries at large, are the particular challenges \nusually associated with small island developing states:   \n\u2022\t small populations, with correspondingly limited skills \nbase and specialized expertise,\n\u2022\t geographic isolation,\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  79", "\u2022\t poor access to markets,\n\u2022\t limited economic diversification, \n\u2022\t dis-economies of scale,\n\u2022\t vulnerability (economically, environmentally, \nculturally), \n\u2022\t loss of capacity through emigration, and\n\u2022\t limited capacity to be represented effectively in \nglobal forums.\nAt the next level are those challenges unique to, or present to a \ngreater extent in, Pacific island states. These include\n\u2022\t gaps in capacity in strategically important areas, \nwhich contribute to vulnerability and dependency;\n\u2022\t relatively young states, frequently struggling with \nissues of legitimacy;\n\u2022\t ongoing tensions between modern and traditional \ninstitutions;\n\u2022\t internal divisions (including active conflicts) that \ndiminish capacity, discourage citizens, and undermine \nstate institutions;\n\u2022\t limited broad-based consensus on national priorities;\n\u2022\t limited capacity for effective demand, or to hold \ngovernments accountable\u2014strong leaders are often \nunchecked in the absence of a sizeable and capable \nmiddle class; \n\u2022\t limited capacity for effective regional collaboration;\n\u2022\t significant aid dependency, coupled with limited \ncapacity to manage it effectively; and\n\u2022\t challenges of leaders juggling multiple \nresponsibilities. \nThe cases also highlight various features of Pacific island states \nthat could be described as \u201dcapacity positive\u201d:\n\u2022\t strong social capital, including legitimacy of \ntraditional institutions that can play an effective role \nin development or use of local capacity, if supported \nproperly;\n 80  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "\u2022\t small communities and local organizations that can \nbe mobilized relatively quickly for change processes \nif effective leadership is in place; and\n\u2022\t systems of engagement for the common good (such \nas the wantok system). \nThe smaller shapes within the Pacific-specific oblong in Figure \n2 represent the diversity of the region and are included to \nunderline the fact that capacity challenges vary depending on \nwhether one is referring to an isolated micro state, a medium-\nsize island state with higher level of economic diversity and \nstrong institutions, or a state with weak institutions emerging \nfrom conflict. Capacity challenges are also situation-specific; \nthe challenges facing Cook Islanders 10 years ago, for example, \nmay be quite different from the ones they are dealing with \ntoday. Similarly, the challenges facing residents of the capital \nisland, Rarotonga, are quite likely to be different than those \nfacing residents of the outer islands. \nFurther, on the issue of Pacific capacity challenges, a 2004 \nADB-funded review of governance in the Pacific suggested that \n\u201cinadequate capacity building, coupled with the loss of senior \nstaff who have management and technical skills, is common in \nmany PDMCs.\u201d [ 86 ] This failure to train and retain many of the \nmost skilled people was seen as \u201ca long-standing contributor \nto concerns over the quality of governance and institutions,\u201d [ 87 ]\nparticularly in Polynesia, but increasingly in other countries \nin the region. \nWhile not a uniquely Pacific concern, ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy \nalso notes that \u201ctoo often, capacity building (in the region) has \nbeen related to the objectives of the project rather than to those \nof the host organization, or capacity building requirements have \nbeen insufficiently analyzed, planned, or coordinated.\u201d [ 88 ]\nDespite these challenges, there are, as identified in the case \nstudies included in this review, examples of successful CD \nin central Government departments, state-owned enterprises, \nand civil society groups in the region. The challenge flowing \nfrom this is to understand better the relevant success factors, \n86   ADB 2004a. \n87  See footnote 2.\n88  ADB 2005a. \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  81", "particularly  those  especially  applicable  in  the  Pacific, \nwhether strong leadership, effective engagement of citizens \nand nonstate actors, organizational legitimacy, or social \nstability.\na.   Country-specific Issues\nWhile people often talk in general terms about the \u201dPacific \nregion,\u201d the region, as the diagram and text above suggest, \nrepresents a multitude of cultural, environmental, political, \nand social conditions. Many countries in the region do share \ncommon cultural characteristics, even histories, but each is also \nunique in various respects\u2014size, the nature of the economy, \nsocial institutions, and governance arrangements. The Cook \nIslands, for example, operates under a \u201cfree association\u201d \narrangement negotiated with New Zealand in 1965. Under \nthis special relationship, Cook Islanders hold New Zealand \ncitizenship and are able to travel freely to New Zealand. The \nlevels of migration fluctuate over time, but during periods of \neconomic downturn on the islands, rates tend to increase. \u201cIn \n1974, for example, when the international airport opened on \nthe main island of Rarotonga, an exodus of over 5,000 people \nwas recorded over the next five years. The next major exodus \nwas a result of the economic downturn in 1995\u201396, when over \n1,000 people left.\u201d [ 89 ] Given Cook Islands small population \n(approximately 18,000), shifts of this magnitude can have a \nsignificant impact on the country, including loss of important \nskills. \nThe RMI is a sovereign nation linked to the United States \n(US) through a Compact of Free Association that entered \ninto force on 21 October 1986. Under the arrangement, the \nUS is responsible for RMI\u2019s security and defense. The US is \nalso obliged to provide the RMI at least US$57 million per \nyear until 2023, including contributions to a jointly managed \ntrust fund. This relationship is important to RMI in terms \nof the revenues it brings in; it also influences decisions on \ndevelopment investments in the country and affects the flow \nof human capacity out of the country. \n89 Wichman 2007. p. 12.\n 82  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world, with an \nestimated population in 2005 of 10,440. As noted in the case \nstudy on the trust fund, Tuvalu is a \u201csmall, isolated, resource-\npoor country made up of nine low lying coral atolls about two \nhours flying time north of Fiji. \u2026. Having virtually no physical \nexports, the main sources of foreign exchange generated locally \nare royalties from distant-water fishing nations for access to \nTuvalu\u2019s exclusive economic zone and remittances sent home \nby maritime workers on foreign merchant vessels. The once \nflourishing philatelic bureau revenue has dwindled to almost \nnothing. International development assistance from bilateral \nand multilateral sources supports the standard of living by \nproviding essential infrastructure, operational supplies, and \ntechnical assistance.\u201d [ 90 ] The country also has a chronic budget \ndeficit and has minimal infrastructure left over from colonial \ndays. These were among the challenges that led the Government \nto pursue the idea of a trust fund as an alternative mechanism \nfor development, with the objective that it would increase \neconomic self reliance. \nPNG is the largest PDMC, with a population of just under \n6  million  spread  across  18  provinces.  The  country  is \nincredibly diverse geographically and culturally; it is home \nto approximately 800 different language groups (more than a \nquarter of the languages in the world). PNG also has significant \nresource wealth, although it has struggled to use that wealth \neffectively for broad-based development. The country has been \nindependent since 1976 but has a significant ongoing bilateral \nrelationship with Australia, including a large development \nassistance program. Governance and security issues continue \nto plague the country and serve as a brake on development.\nAs important as the geographic and environmental characteristics \nof Pacific island countries is their culture and how it defines \nthe uniqueness of each country and the communities therein. \nTraditions relating to decision making, power sharing, and \nrole of women are often deeply rooted and can significantly \ninfluence domestic change processes, including those aimed \nat developing domestic capacity.

This table, while incomplete, reflects the \nresults of that exercise.\nb.  Capacity Challenges of Fragile or Post-conflict States \nMost of the approaches to CD described in this report would be \napplicable in most developing countries. However, fragile, weakly \nperforming and post-conflict states face additional capacity \nchallenges. Furthermore, those challenges vary by fragile state, \nwhether the country is in decline, emerging from conflict, or \nchronically weak. Post-conflict states, in particular, are usually \nunder pressure to quickly restore security, services, and state \ninstitutions at a time when capacity is weak and infrastructure \nmay have been destroyed, while public institutions are barely \nfunctioning, are without staff, and may lack legitimacy in the \neyes of citizens.   \nThe ADB\u2019s April 2007 report on weakly performing countries [ 91 ]\noutlines key points about operating in weakly performing \ncountries. It suggests that no single or standardized approach \napplies and that it is important to \u201cre-examine local conditions \nto find ways to work effectively.\u201d That entails, in part, ensuring \na clear understanding of the reasons for the fragility of the state. \nIn conflict, or post-conflict situations, this includes gaining an \nunderstanding of the reasons for the conflict. However, as a \n91 ADB 2007a.\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  85", "recent AusAID report on Timor-Leste indicated, \u201csome advisors \nappear to be conflict blind \u2026. waiting for things to \u2018return to \nnormal,\u2019\u201d [ 92 ] which leads to the suggestion that conflict analysis \nneed be undertaken to ensure that interventions avoid a \u201dbusiness \nas usual\u201d approach. \nDerick Brinkerhoff [ 93 ] has identified four scenarios, shown in \nFigure 3 below, that can help to frame thinking about capacity \nissues in fragile states and how to engage governments on \nreforms: \nFigure 3:   Fragile States: Capacity and willingness\nwillingness\nWeak Strong\nWeak At risk or failed Weak but willing\ny\nt\nci\na\np\na\nC Strong but \nStrong Good performer\nunresponsive\nSource: Brinkerhoff, adapted from Department for International Development (DFID). 2006.

[ 94 ]\nAs Brinkerhoff notes, all but the \u201cgood performers\u201d in Figure \n3 are considered fragile states, either because of weak capacity \nor weak willingness, or both. Brinkerhoff cautions, however, \nthat fragile states are not static; they evolve and shift over time \ndepending on a myriad of factors that can influence the capacity \nof the state and the commitment of key stakeholders to reforms. \nThe two conflict-related cases reviewed for this study\u2014Solomon \nIslands and Timor-Leste\u2014can probably be described as having \nweak capacity and weak to strong willingness or commitment. \nThe case study on Solomon Islands\u2019 Ministry of Infrastructure \nDevelopment (MID) describes how MID went through a significant \nchange process, with ADB support, following the conflict in that \ncountry. Solomon Islands was at the time of the project in an \n92   AusAID 2007. p. 8.\n93   Brinkerhoff 2007. \n94   Brinkerhoff 2007. p. 1. Under the broader category of failed state, the study describes PNG as \n\u201ddeteriorating\u201d and Solomon Islands as being in \u201dearly recovery.\u201d  \n 86  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "\u201dearly recovery stage,\u201d which is often associated with modest or \nuneven results due to such factors as lack of strong leadership to \nsupport reforms, or inadequate capacity to implement them. TA \nprovided by ADB sought to help MID develop new policies and \nprocedures to support infrastructure development in the country, \nessentially shifting the ministry\u2019s role from being a provider of \nservices to a regulator. The project evaluation noted successes in \nsome but not all areas, in part due to the weakness of government \ninstitutions and miscalculations as to what could be achieved in \nlight of prevailing circumstances and the relatively short time \nframe for the project. It was not apparent from the case the extent \nto which the TA design was informed by an understanding of \nthe dynamics of the conflict, or thinking about how to address \ncapacity issues in the early stages following a conflict. \nThe Timor-Leste case describes UNDP support to the Government \nto strengthen its capacity during the post-conflict transition. The \nsupport was broad-based, using a three-pillar model: skills and \nknowledge, systems and processes, and attitudes and behaviors \n(Figure 4). In support of these three pillars, advisors offered \nsupport in training, policy, legislative frameworks, development \nof manuals, and strengthening of operating systems.\nFigure 4:   Spheres of Advisors\u2019 Accomplishments in Capacity Development\nSPHeReS oF ADVISoR\u2019S ACCoMPlISHMentS\n\u2022\tOn the job\n\u2022\tStructured courses (in-house)\n\u2022\tTraining of trainers\n\u2022\tProfessional or formal training\n\u2022\tAssistance with \ndevelopment  training\nof primary and  \u2022\tAssistance \nsupplementary  with policy \nlegislation for  frameworks in \nState institutions all areas\n\u2022\tHelping to ensure  legislative  Policy  \u2022\tFrameworks \ncoordination of  Frameworks Frameworks that allow \nlegislative process for coherent \n\u2022\tProvision of  planning\nregular legal  \u2022\tAnual Action \nadvice to senior  Plans and SIPS\noperating Manuals\nTimorese managers\nSystems\n\u2022\tInternal operating systems  \u2022\tManuals/guidelines \nhave helped to establish  covering training, \nStandard Operating  procedural and ethical \nProcedures for many key tasks matters\nSource: Civilian Support Group - CSG and UNDP\nThe Study - Overview of Findings  87", "The intervention was seen as a success because of the application \nof \u201ccomplementary policy and capacity building interventions\u201d, \nincluding\n\u2022\t preparation of a national poverty assessment report \n(which provided necessary statistical data and \nbaseline information),\n\u2022\t human resources needs assessment,\n\u2022\t establishment of capacity development coordination \nunit,\n\u2022\t completion of first national development plan, and\n\u2022\t development of a capacity development program for \nthe National Planning and Development Agency.

[ 96 ]\n4.   Monitoring and evaluation of \nCapacity Development\na.   what is being Measured?\nMonitoring and evaluation (M&E) in most of the cases did not \nhave an explicit focus on capacity issues. This is not inconsistent \nwith findings in other CD studies, which have found that, by \nand large, M&E of development projects and programs tend to \nfocus on changes in performance (primarily output and outcome \n95  Based on brief paper entitled Planning for a Society in Transition: Creating Institutions and \nBuilding Capacity (Timor-Leste) (case study is incomplete).\n96   AusAID 2007. p. 14\u201315. \n 88  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "level). There are various reasons for this: changes in capacity \nare often difficult to measure, especially soft capacities, such as \nleadership, or the collective capacity of multiple organizations \nworking together. It is also difficult to measure change in capacity \nsystems (as compared to individual or organizational-level \nchange). Furthermore, donor incentive systems and monitoring \nframeworks are still geared predominantly toward measuring \nand being accountable for \u201dperformance results.\u201d \nThere are several exceptions in the cases studied. In the Cook \nIslands harmonization case, the M&E framework focused, in \npart, on the capacity of the AMD. The participatory monitoring \nand evaluation surveys referred to in the Tuvalu trust fund \ncase included awareness and participation in decision-making \nprocesses, which can be considered measures of community \nempowerment or capacity.  \nThe PNG TA facilities and the PPII, given their mandate and \norientation, have taken a more focused approach to monitoring \ncapacity changes. They also rely on different approaches. For \nexample, monitoring of the Capacity Building Service Centre\u2019s \nmanaging contractor in PNG\u2019s health sector emphasizes \u201dquality \nof inputs,\u201d as opposed to outputs realized. This is due to several \nfactors: the clear emphasis on capacity building in the advisor\u2019s \nrole, recognition by AusAID and the managing contractor of the \nimportance of quality of inputs and the nature of the advisor \nengagement vis \u00e0 vis realization of capacity objectives, and \nrecognition that many factors (often beyond the control of the \nadvisor) are likely to affect outputs or outcomes. \nSimilarly,  under  the  AusAID-funded  Fiji  health  sector \nimprovement program (FHSIP), long-term advisors are subject to \nannual performance assessments that measure progress against \ntheir capacity building plans, their work plans, and performance \ncompetencies. The last mentioned includes such considerations \nas ability to share ideas and information with others, ability to \nadjust capacity-building plans, and appropriateness of behavior. \nThe performance assessment process is based on feedback \nfrom the advisor, his or her counterpart, the FHSIP program \ndirector, and/or a representative from the Australian managing \ncontractor.  \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  89", "In the PPII, participants are monitoring capacity results (it is \ntoo early to demonstrate results in service delivery or sector \nperformance).  Capacity  changes  being  measured  include \nthe extent to which initiatives have strengthened provincial \nmanagement, budget, and human resource systems; coordination \nbetween provinces and districts; and links between the national \nand provincial governments.      \nIncreasing attention is being given to monitoring capacity, given \nits stated centrality as a development priority. [ 97 ] This includes \nexploring ways of assessing changes in hard and soft capacities, \nand relying on more qualitative measures, including those that \ncan incorporate intermediate capacity changes while not losing \nsight of longer-term capacity results. Part of the challenge is \nin reconciling long-term capacity interests with donors\u2019 usual \ncommitment to \u201dobjectively verifiable indicators\u201d of change in \ntime frames of 4\u20135 years or less. Despite recent experimentation \nand increased attention to M&E of capacity, as in the initiatives \nabove, it remains a work in progress. \nb.   who is Measuring? For what Purpose?\nAs with other projects covered in the case studies, theKiribati water \nand sanitation case noted how the government implementing \nagency for the TA project had no formal mechanism to assess \nthe TA, including its impact. This led the case authors to suggest \nthat too often there is an over-dependence on donors for M&E \nof projects.\nThis is consistent with findings from other reviews, which have \ncharacterized M&E as a largely extractive process, with data \nmainly being mined by donors for their accountability purposes \nwith modest engagement by local stakeholders. The exceptions, \nonce again, appear to be the PNG TA facilities and the PPII, \nwhich have encouraged PNG leadership in defining capacity \nobjectives and measuring corresponding results. \nc.   Are there lessons and Are they being learned? \nFrom the observations above, it would be safe to conclude that, \nwith several exceptions, the cases studied yielded few examples of \n97 See, for example, Engel, Land, and Keizer 2006. \n 90  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "systematic learning about CD through formal M&E frameworks. \nThis means limited systematic learning about design processes \nfor CD interventions, about implementation strategies, or about \nthe effectiveness of advisors in contributing to sustainable \nchanges in PDMC capacity.  \n  \nNevertheless, the more \u201dsuccessful\u201d projects among the cases \nreviewed had an above-average ability to learn and adapt as \nthey proceeded. This adaptive capacity [ 98 ] is seen as an important \ncharacteristic of vibrant, well functioning organizations or \nsystems and includes the ability to learn from experience, \nreflect, and shift directions in response to learning or changing \nconditions in the programming context. The challenge is how \nto foster that capacity and use it to improve analysis and \nunderstanding of CD processes.  \n98 See Sorgenfrei and Wrigley (2005) for more on the concept of adaptive capacity. \nThe Study - Overview of Findings  91", "wItHout CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\nwItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent\n 92  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "IV. ConCluSIonS  \u2013 \nKey tHeMeS\nBased on the study findings, four main themes appear to be key \nto advancing the CD agenda within ADB\u2019s Pacific department: \nthe importance of context and capacity systems, thinking \nstrategically about capacity, programming strategically for \nsustainable capacity, and learning from experience. These are \ndiscussed below.\nA.   the Importance of Context \nand Capacity Systems\nOne theme reflected in the case studies, and a constant in \nthe literature on CD, is the importance of the programming \ncontext in influencing opportunities for and the shape of CD \nprocesses. The \u201dstronger\u201d projects in this study were those that \nunderstood the context, either through extensive consultative \nand participatory processes, by building on locally articulated \npolicies or priorities, or by relying on advisors who had a solid \nunderstanding of the local context. As Simon Tiller, the lead \nconsultant on the ADB-sponsored RMI fisheries project noted: \u201cIt \nis absolutely imperative to get under the skin of the environment \nyou are working in. That was happening towards the end of the \nfirst TA and it was a major part of why we were able to move so \nquickly with the second TA.\u201d [ 99 ] Case writer Ben Graham noted \nthat before arriving at a key turning point in the project, the \nlead consultant: \u201chad not yet fully recognized the less obvious \ninformal decision-making processes that exist beneath the \nmore formal government processes and procedures. As Tiller \ncommented, these connections \u2019were not on any organization \n99 Graham 2007a, p. 5.\nConclusions  \u2013 Key Themes  93", "chart.\u2019 Tiller added, \u2018For the first time I felt we were partners and \nfrom that point on we began to make real progress.\u2019\u201d [ 100 ]\nWith Tuvalu\u2019s Falekaupule trust fund, stakeholders made a clear \ndecision to proceed \u201cfrom an understanding of what works at \nthe island level (and) develop processes that build on traditions \nand integrate these into internationally recognized development \nprocesses.\u201d [ 101 ] This example highlights, as do others, the \nimportance of understanding local traditions and culture as well \nas power dynamics and informal relationships. \nAside from the fairly local contexts above are the national \ncontexts in the Pacific discussed earlier. Each includes factors \nthat influence, one way or the other, attempts to strengthen \nor utilize capacity. The Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste case \nstudies, for example, highlight the significant effect of the \nconflicts in those countries on efforts to restore or otherwise \naddress capacity concerns. Other projects reviewed point to the \ninfluence of political economy or sociocultural issues, the wantok \nsystem in PNG, or the role of the kingdoms in Polynesia. \n \nPolitical, economic, aid, and associational links among PDMCs \nand with larger regional countries, can also be important \ncontextual factors, such as the Cook Islands historical link with \nNew Zealand, RMI\u2019s free association arrangement with the US, \nPNG\u2019s sizeable development assistance program with Australia, \nand the various regional arrangements that link Pacific island \ncountries. In addition, new donors, particularly the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and Taipei,China,  are influencing parts of \nthe region and have begun to influence the overall landscape of \nexternal assistance and approaches to \u201ddevelopment\u201d activities.\nThus, mechanisms are needed for external stakeholders, in \nparticular, to develop a solid understanding of the programming \ncontext (regional, national, and local), including capacity issues \ntherein, before programming decisions are made. Several reviews \nhave noted this as an area where ADB could be strengthened, \nincluding recommendations for \u201cmore joint analytical work\u201d and \n\u201cpolitical economy analysis.\u201d [ 102 ] The emphasis in the analysis \nis likely to vary by circumstance but, based on prominent \nissues in this review, would probably include institutional, \n100  Graham 2007a, p. 5.\n101  Bell 2007, p. 3.\n102  See, for example, ADB 2007a. \n 94  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "policy, political, or security issues; stakeholder relationships; \ninterorganizational issues; organizational culture; leadership; \ntechnical and managerial capacity; incentives; informal rules; \nlegitimacy; and demand-side capacity. \nMechanisms or processes likely to be effective in that respect \ninclude\n\u2022\t locally-based, participatory consultative processes;\n\u2022\t surveys;\n\u2022\t contextual analyses;\n\u2022\t capacity mapping;\n\u2022\t institutional assessments;\n\u2022\t SWOT  (strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and \nthreats) analyses;\n\u2022\t stakeholder analysis;\n\u2022\t sector assessments;\n\u2022\t capacity and vulnerability analyses; and\n\u2022\t policy environment mapping.\nB.  thinking Strategically about Capacity \nOnce a reasonably clear understanding of the programming \ncontext has been established, the next step is to think strategically \nabout capacity opportunities and constraints in that context. \nThe findings from the case studies and other reviews offer \nsome guidance on this. First is the importance of thinking in \nterms of capacity systems, specifically ensuring that analyses \nand programming strategies are based on an understanding of \nthe dynamics of the broader capacity system and relationships \nwithin it. \nThe conceptual framework in Figure 5 offers a way of thinking \nabout the relationships among the different capacity levels. [ 103 ]\nThe framework suggests that the various levels are linked, and \nthat changes planned in one level are likely to be influenced \nby factors in other parts of the system. For example, efforts to \nenhance organizational capacity or performance are likely to be \nshaped as much by forces in the enabling environment (such as \nlaws, regulations, attitudes, and values) as by factors internal \nto the organization, (skills, systems, leadership, relationships, \n103  This framework is a variation of the ADB framework shown earlier in this report. Among other \nthings, it adds reference to individuals and the enabling environment.\nConclusions  \u2013 Key Themes  95", "etc.). Similarly, the success of a training program is likely \nto be contingent as much on conditions in the participating \norganization\u2014such as incentives, supportive management, or \nfinances\u2014as the quality of the training inputs. \nFigure 5: Conceptual Framework: Capacity levels \nenabling environment\nPublic Sector \nInstitutional Context\nSector / network\norganization, group\noRg\n4\noRg\n1 Individual\noRg\n3\noRg\n2\nZoom In Zoom out\nThe small lines in Figure 5 represent the links between the various \ncapacity dimensions or levels. The larger arrows underline the \nimportance of \u201dzooming in and out,\u201d to use UNDP\u2019s language, in \nthe analysis of the capacity challenge and in the search for possible \nsolutions. By zooming in and out, planners and practitioners are \nable to assess opportunities and constraints at various levels, \ntheir potential impact on one another, and determine the most \nappropriate level(s) or type(s) of intervention. \nInterventions, for example, may zoom in on an organizational \nchange process, or alternately seek to address an issue(s) across \nseveral levels. Decisions about specific programming interventions \nare likely to be based on several variables, including the nature \nof the development problem, existing programs, current capacity \nstrengths or weaknesses in the various levels, and opportunities \n 96  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "or inhibitors in the enabling environment. In sum, the framework \ncalls for systematic analysis of opportunities and constraints, \nidentification  of  windows  of  opportunity,  strategic  entry \npoints, and promotion of integrated responses. This perspective \nrepresents, arguably, the most important contribution of CD\u2014a \nsystematic recognition of the importance of thinking about \nindividuals, organizations, programs, and policies as part of a \ngreater whole.\nIt is important to note, as does the World Bank\u2019s study on \neffective states and engaged societies [ 104 ], that interventions that \nare \u201csystemic\u201d do not necessarily need to be comprehensive in \nscope. In fact, the scope and timing of an intervention should \nbe sensitive to the absorptive capacity of local partners and \ntheir readiness to implement change. This may lead to \u201cstrategic \nincrementalism\u201d which itself needs to be built on an understanding \nof the dynamics of the capacity system and a sense of how inputs \nmight be sequenced to maximize effectiveness.  \nTable 1 highlights specific capacity issues to consider in the \nvarious levels of the CD framework in Figure 5.\ntable 1: Strategic Capacity-related Issues to Consider\nCapacity-related Issues (a sampling) \nEnabling  \u0083  Macroeconomic situation \nEnvironment  \u0083  Government policies, legal and/or \nadministrative environment \n\u0083  Regulatory environment \n\u0083  Sociocultural environment\n\u0083  Views of prospective stakeholders \n\u0083  Political will, including historical and \ncontemporary explanations\n\u0083  Power structures and formal and \ninformal institutions\n\u0083  Incentives\nPublic Sector  \u0083  Poverty reduction strategies and plans\nInstitutional  \u0083  Public financial management\nContext  \u0083  Subnational governance\n\u0083  Administrative and legislative reforms\n\u0083  Civil society participation\n\u0083  Legitimacy and credibility of state \ninstitutions \n104  World Bank, 2005a.

Hard capacities usually refer to \nindividual or organizational competencies, such as financial \nplanning, engineering, or resource management. Soft capacities \ninclude leadership; legitimacy; trust; and ability to facilitate, \nmotivate, or strengthen identity, values, or a shared sense of \nmission. Soft capacities also include the notion of adaptive \ncapacity, as well as the capacity to collaborate, network, or \notherwise strengthen partnerships. Various reviews and analyses \nsuggest that CD efforts often fail, or fall short of expectations, \ndue to a lack of attention to these less tangible, \u201csoft\u201d capacity \nissues. Part of the reason is that it is usually easier to address hard \ncapacities, which are more likely to yield objectively measurable \nresults in the short to medium term. \nThe Cook Islands aid coordination case exemplified the importance \nof \u201dsoft\u201d capacities\u2014leadership, diplomacy, and negotiation skills \nto deal with misunderstandings as they arose. These capacities \nwere not necessarily cultivated through the project but already \nexisted to a sufficient extent to allow the initiative to progress \nsuccessfully, including dealing with hard capacities, such as \nmanagement capability in AMD. The RMI youth services case \nalso underlined the importance of leadership, although in this \n 98  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "case, it was the lack of leadership that ultimately limited its \nsuccess, despite significant investments in policy development \nand delivery systems.  \nThe Nauru case study on its national sustainable development \nstrategy offered a lesson on the issue of legitimacy as a soft \ncapacity. The case study describes how limited trust and \nconfidence in state institutions led to a more purposeful \nengagement of civil society (\u201ca new kind of participation\u201d) to \nensure that the national sustainable development strategy would \nhave legitimacy in the eyes of the public. \nA third strategic consideration to take into account at the planning \nstage is the relationship between capacity and performance. The \nEuropean Centre for Development Policy Management study on \ncapacity, change, and performance has addressed this issue. The \nstudy\u2019s interim report highlighted several key issues:\n\u2022\t The relationship between capacity and performance \nis complex, particularly given the multitude of \nintervening variables at play within a capacity \nsystem at any point in time.\n\u2022\t Most discussions about capacity are really about \nperformance and how to improve it.\n\u2022\t Short-term gains in performance are often important \nto sustain momentum in long-term CD programs \nbut can be mistaken for sustainable changes in local \ncapacity.\n\u2022\t There are few incentives or rewards for focusing on \nlong-term capacity in a context where pressures to \nimprove performance are intense. This is particularly \nso in highly destabilized (such as post-conflict) or \npoliticized environments. [ 105 ]      \nTable 2 highlights some of the differences between a focus on \ndevelopment performance or results and developing capacity. \n105  European Centre for Development Policy Management 2005a. p. 17\u201318. \nConclusions  \u2013 Key Themes  99", "table 2: Development Performance and Capacity Development\nCapacity \nAspects of Change   Performance (results) \nDevelopment \nPurpose  maximizing  developing \nApproach to  development results  capacity \ncapacity issues  seen as secondary  seen as an end \nLeadership means in support of  in itself \nMain focus  performance ends    more \nPlanning  more directed and top  participatory and \napplication  down  inclusive \nTangibles and  structure and systems,  individual and \nintangibles  incentives, demand  collective skills, \nMotivation  pressures  culture, and \nEmphasis on  systematic and solution- mindset \nlearning and  driven  emergent \nexperimentation  standardized and  and more \nMonitoring and  uniform incremental \nevaluation  more emphasis on the  responsive and \ntangibles  varied \nincentives lead  more emphasis \nmodest  on the \nfocus on results  intangibles \nincentives lag \ncritical \nfocus on \ncapacity \nUse of external  intensive and focused  less intensive \ntechnical  on task achievement  and focused \nassistance  on process and \nfacilitation \nSource: Morgan, Baser, and Land 2007.\nMost of the Pacific case studies had a fairly explicit emphasis on \nperformance improvement (consistent with the middle column \nin Table 2), as opposed to a strategic focus on capacity, that is, \nhow to develop, strengthen, or discover ways to use it more \neffectively. Among the exceptions were the TA facilities in PNG, \nwhich have a more clearly defined commitment to capacity\u2014of \nindividuals, organizations, and whole systems\u2014in their mandates. \nA fundamental question for program planners is how they frame \ntheir investments: as long-term CD efforts or as initiatives \nthat seek primarily to increase performance over the short to \nmedium term. Or is there a way to support short- to medium-\nterm performance improvement while also encouraging, or at \nleast not undermining, longer-term capacity interests? \nA fourth strategic consideration, based on the findings from \nthe case studies, is the role of the external intervener. CD \nspecialist Peter Morgan has suggested that there are broadly four \n 100  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "approaches to external interventions in development projects; \nthey can be plotted along a continuum as follows: \n1)  External interveners doing the work and hoping \nthat capacity will be developed through modeling or \nexposure (country systems tend to be bypassed).\n2)  External interveners design and control the approach, \nbut  try  to  engage  local  counterparts  through \nconsultation, participation, on-the-job training, and \nother measures (the \u201ddirect\u201d approach).\n3)  External interveners work within developing-country \nprocesses, building on local motivations and facilitating \nchange (accompaniment or the \u201cindirect\u201d approach). \n4)  Providing payments for demonstrated progress (\u201dhands-\noff\u201d approach) [ 106 ]\nThe implication is that the third approach is most consistent with \nCD and aid effectiveness principles, unless PDMCs are positioned \nto benefit from direct financial support without other external \ninputs as per option 4. \nA final strategic capacity consideration to address early in any \nCD initiative is the sustainability challenge: how to ensure a \nfocus on what lasts versus simply \u201dwhat works now.\u201d This is, \nof course, linked to the previous points, including the relative \nemphasis to be placed, and over what period of time, on capacity \nversus performance results. \nThe case studies did not yield a great deal of hard evidence on \nthe issue of sustainability, partly because some of the projects \nand  programs  reviewed  were  still  ongoing.  Nevertheless, \nconcerns were expressed in some cases with respect to the \nlikelihood of sustaining results, whether they be performance \nor capacity results. The Cook Islands public sector reform case, \nfor example, illustrated the challenge of maintaining capacity \nreforms over a decade with changing leadership and shifting \ngovernment priorities. This and other similar experiences beg the \nquestion: what combination of inputs and enabling conditions \nis most likely to ensure sustainable capacity results? Expressed \ndifferently, how does one turn a series of capacity transactions, \nand under what types of conditions, into durable capacity \ntransformations?\n106 Based on correspondence with Peter Morgan.\nConclusions  \u2013 Key Themes  101", "C.  Programming Strategically \nfor Sustainable Capacity \nAs the preceding sections suggest, the overall focus in any \nCD intervention should be on ensuring sustainable changes \nin capacity. At the same time, it is recognized that there can \nbe tensions to be managed between the desire for short-term \nresults (on the part of various stakeholders) and the longer-term \nprocess of CD. This is particularly true in fragile states anxious \nto improve services or strengthen the role of state institutions. \nThus, there must be agreement among stakeholders on strategies, \ntime frames, and processes for monitoring, learning, and \nadjusting approaches. Based on the experiences from the cases \nand CD principles adopted by donor agencies, implementation \nof CD projects and programs should be guided by the following \nconsiderations:\n\u2022\t Local ownership and leadership are of paramount \nimportance.\n\u2022\t Projects  and  programs  should  build  on  existing \ndeveloping-country capacities, using external resources \nonly when value is clearly added.\n\u2022\t Participatory approaches are necessary to reinforce \nownership, ensure legitimacy, and strengthen capacity \nof local stakeholders\u2014follow the local lead.\n\u2022\t Priority should be given to supporting developing-\ncountry programs.\n\u2022\t The primary role of the external partner should be \nfacilitative and supportive.\n\u2022\t Donor coordination should be encouraged to ensure \ncoherent approaches and to minimize demands on \ndeveloping-country partners.\n\u2022\t Investments should be geared to the long term.\n\u2022\t Expectations should be realistic, i.e., based on capacity \nassessments and agreed targets.\n\u2022\t Donors should be flexible in their approaches and \nrequirements.\n 102  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "wItH CAPACIty DeVeloPMent", "\u2022\t Projects  and  programs  should  rely  on  iterative \napproaches,  ongoing  learning,  and  adaptation; \nthis implies less distinction between design and \nimplementation.\n\u2022\t Projects and programs should be managed for results \nand avoid excessive focus on management of inputs.\n\u2022\t Expected results should be seen as strategic directions \nthat will change over time as a result of learning. \nDecisions also have to be made about the overarching capacity \nstrategy, which may or may not involve \u201ddevelopment\u201d of \ncapacity.

As noted earlier, not a great deal of systematic learning \nfrom experience was noted in the case studies, specifically on the \nissue of CD. This is a reflection of the orientation of the projects; \nonce again, the projects most likely to yield capacity lessons \nare those with a clear focus on CD in their design. The charter \nagreement for the Capacity Building Service Centre in PNG, \nfor example, commits all partners to \u201cinnovation, outstanding \nperformance, best practice and dissemination of lessons learned \nto continuously improve the performance of the Service Centre.\u201d \nThe charter also provides for the establishment of a learning and \ninnovation panel, which was intended to, among other things, \n\u201cenable the Service Centre to develop and synthesize knowledge, \nskills, lessons learned, and techniques to continuously improve \ncapacity building within PNG.\u201d \n 104  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "As noted previously, many of the cases reviewed did display a \ncapacity to learn and adapt in response to emerging opportunities \nor changes in the programming environment, but lessons were \nrarely captured in capacity terms. Consistent with the description \nin the last few sections, learning on CD could include\n\u2022\t analysis of changes in the enabling environment, \nsuch as policies, institutional rules, and their impact \non capacity utilization, participation of citizen or \ncommunity groups, and awareness raising; \n\u2022\t analysis  of  organizational  change  processes  to \nassess their impact on strategic leadership capability, \nplanning or service delivery, financial management, \nand collaboration;  \n\u2022\t tracking  of  individual  capacity  enhancement  to \ndetermine effects on organizational capacity and \nperformance; and\n\u2022\t analysis of incentive systems and their impact on \ncapacity strengthening and retention.\nEncouraging organizations to focus on monitoring and learning \ncan be, in and of itself, a valuable capacity-strengthening \nexercise with potential to contribute to long-term organizational \nwell-being and improved performance.\nThe main conclusion on this issue is that if development planners \nand practitioners are to strengthen CD efforts, greater emphasis \nneeds to be placed on documenting experiences and lessons, \nsharing them through various means, and incorporating lessons \nin project and program designs.

IMPlICAtIonS FoR ADB\nThe findings and observations in this report have implications \nfor ADB, bilateral donors, and DMCs in their approach to CD. \nThese implications are addressed in the sections below. \nFirst, several projects reviewed for this study have stressed the \nvalue of working from a clear initial understanding of capacity \nissues, as well as the social, economic, cultural, and political \nfactors that can affect CD processes. From the perspective of \nexternal interveners, the \u201csuccesses\u201d reviewed highlight the value \nof highly participatory planning and design processes, as well as \nthe usefulness of looking beyond technical issues in assessment \nprocesses to factors in the various capacity levels (including \n\u201csoft\u201d capacities) that could have a bearing on implementation. \nIn addition, the experiences show the value of encouraging \n\u201ddemand\u201d as one way of ensuring local ownership of change \nprocesses while enhancing the capacity of citizens to function \neffectively in democratic states. \nConsistent with this study\u2019s findings, ADB\u2019s first CD thematic \nreport  (December  2006)  noted  the  importance  of  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) [ 107 ] to strengthening demand \norientation and effectiveness of CD. It acknowledges that ADB \nis endeavoring to integrate CD into CPS priorities and to take a \nmore strategic approach, but suggests that CD still needs to be \nmainstreamed in sector development. The report also indicates \nthat there is potential to expand capacity assessments and that \nfurther work needs to be done to mainstream participatory \napproaches. It also calls for better support for local ownership \nand leadership, better change management processes, and better \ndiagnostics.\nSeveral of the cases have underscored the particular challenges \nin dealing effectively with capacity issues in post-conflict \n107 The CPS replaced ADB\u2019s country strategy and program in 2006 to reflect an enhanced emphasis \non partnership-based approaches. \n    Implications for ADB  107", "countries. At core is the dilemma of how to respond to demands \nfor restoration of peace, security, and government services while \nremaining focused on long-term capacity issues. The conflict-\nrelated cases reviewed in this study, and the broader literature, \nsuggest particular requirements at the planning and design stage \nas highlighted earlier. \nThe findings from the various case studies also have implications \nfor capacity programming, including a need to be responsive to \ncontextual factors, to be careful to build on what exists, to pay \nattention to broader systems issues, and to recognize the need \nfor adequate time to progress at an appropriate pace. \nAs this study has shown, M&E can be challenging at the best of \ntimes. This is due, in part, to the ambiguous nature of \u201dcapacity\u201d \nand the corresponding difficulty in measuring change in capacity \nover time. It is also challenged by a general tendency to focus \nM&E on performance results as opposed to capacity results.\nIn the ADB context, the 2006 CD thematic report notes that only \n21% of ADB-sponsored TA is presently classified as CD, which \nsuggests that 79% of TA is still not monitored or evaluated in \nrelation to its impact on capacity.\nSome of the initiatives reviewed attempted to take a more \nsystematic approach to assessing the impact of inputs on domestic \ncapacity. Closer examination of these and similar experiences \nprovides an opportunity for ADB to learn and adopt methods for \nimproving M&E of CD initiatives. [ 108 ] The case studies have also \nprovided an opportunity to consider the incentives for M&E of \nCD, and the relatively limited feedback on this suggests that it \nis strongly driven by donor requirements rather than demands \nof local stakeholders.\n108Starting points for information on monitoring and evaluation of capacity development \ninclude (i) MandE News, http://www.mande.co.uk/ and (ii) Watson, D. 2005.

Of particular note is the work of the capacity \ndevelopment working group (CDWG), which was responsible for \nthe November 2006 document: Integrating Capacity Development \ninto Country Programs and Operations, Proposed Medium-Term \nFramework and Action Plan. [ 109 ] ADB has recently also produced \nvarious reports evaluating TA effectiveness and how to achieve \ndevelopment effectiveness in weakly performing countries.  \nThis section draws on those sources, as well as the findings of \nthe Pacific CD study and the results of ADB\u2019s August 2007 Pacific \ncapacity development retreat to offer some thoughts about how \nto move the CD agenda forward in PARD. \n1.  Institutionalizing a CD Approach \nin Country Programs \nAccording to the CDWG November 2006 report, \u201c\u2026 there is general \nagreement that in the past sector road maps have been generally \nweak. Road maps are often not based on a good understanding \nof country capacities and CD priorities, and it is not always \nclear to what extent ADB\u2019s program contributes to the larger \nreform agenda within a sector or theme. The understanding of \nthe political economy context is often weak. It also appears that \nthe rationale for sector or thematic prioritization often does \nnot reflect a discussion among country teams of the relative \ncapacities of key crosscutting and sector agencies. Assessments of \nbasic change management issues, such as leadership, ownership, \nand stakeholder buy-in, are frequently not reflected in CSPs. In \nview of the required greater reliance on country systems, there \nis a need for a more effective strategic prioritization of such \ncritical country capacities as public financial management and \nresults-based management and for a clearer integration of ADB \nsector support into DMC sector strategies. CPS review processes \nneed to build on endogenous CD progress reviews at crosscutting \nthematic, sector, and local government levels.\u201d [ 110 ] \n109  ADB 2006g. \n110  ADB 2006g. \n    Implications for ADB  109", "The  CDWG  recommended  that  ADB  respond  to  these \nshortcomings by (i) working with country teams to identify \npriority organizations in DMCs to work with on CD initiatives, \n(ii) determine which institutional elements of the enabling \nenvironment should be assisted as part of the CPS, (iii) determine \nkey stakeholders and partnerships or systems to be supported, \nand (iv) determine how these initiatives will fit into sector \nplans in the country partnership strategy. Box 7 summarizes \nthese points. Specific expected results and associated activities \nidentified in the CDWG\u2019s final report relating to country strategy \nand programs and how to institutionalize a CD approach are \noutlined in Appendix 5. \nBox 7:  Summary of Implications for ADB on Institutionalizing a CD \nApproach\nThe findings from this study, Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncapacity development working group (CDWG) report, and 2007 CD \nretreat suggest that ADB needs to \n\u00bb  strengthen mechanisms to enhance understanding of the \nprogramming context, including capacity issues, as a basis \nfor country partnership strategies (CPSs), including political \neconomy issues, leadership, ownership, commitment, and \ncapacities associated with key cross-cutting and sector \nissues. Political economy analyses should be done with \nlocal stakeholders and analyses carried out by other donors \nshould be used where possible; \n\u00bb  draw on this enhanced understanding to secure agreement \nwith Pacific developing member countries on CD priorities \nand strategies to be reflected in the CPS as well as sector \nstrategies and plans;\n\u00bb  see the country CD strategy process as an ongoing, country-\nled process guided by participatory methods; and\n\u00bb  through consultations on the CPS, ensure a better fit \nbetween ADB programming strategies (including CD \nstrategies), Pacific country programming and CD priorities, \nand the broader reform agenda in the country.\nOther suggestions raised by retreat participants relating to CD \nand country programs included the following: \n\u2022\t Mainstream  CD  in  country  partnership  strategy \nformulation.\n\u2022\t Assist countries to analyze political economy issues \n(drivers of change).\n\u2022\t Involve more players, beyond government, at the CPS \nstage. \n 110  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "\u2022\t Use country processes and the right local people to \nassess capacity. \n\u2022\t Do  consultation  and  participation,  as  they  are \n\u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d\n\u2022\t Hire people who know and understand the area. \n\u2022\t Avoid multiple donor-led CD plans.\n\u2022\t Do not just focus on \u201dtechnical fixes.\u201d \n\u2022\t Focus on the country strategy but approve allocations \nannually.\n\u2022\t Do not focus solely on money; look into other \nsolutions.\n\u2022\t Improve incentives for staff.\nRetreat participants recognized the challenge of understanding \nthe drivers of change as well as capacities of communities\u2014a \nprocess that is made more difficult by the limited time allocated \nfor community engagement and strategy development. A \npossible solution identified for ADB was to partner with an \norganization that has comparative advantage, has been doing \npolitical economy, and is \u201dliving\u201d in partner countries, such as \nUNDP\u2014which also has a set of default principles for capacity \ndevelopment (Appendix 6). \nOther issues for ADB consideration include \n\u2022\t the nature of the consultation and participation \nprocesses required to ensure CD issues are addressed \nadequately in the CPS; \n\u2022\t how to frame capacity issues in the CPS, including how \nto address them from a systems perspective; \n\u2022\t role of ADB\u2019s resident missions in the CPS process;\n\u2022\t roles for CD specialist or advisor in supporting \ndevelopment of the CPS, including integration of CD \nprinciples and strategies; \n\u2022\t special needs and requirements of small PDMCs\u2014do \nthey require different assessment processes?; \n\u2022\t how to monitor capacity results linked to the CPS; \nand\n\u2022\t the particular challenges of fragile or post-conflict \nstates\u2014how do these affect the CPS process? \nADB\u2019s April 2007 report on weakly performing countries \naddresses the last point, indicating that ADB\u2019s response has been \n    Implications for ADB  111", "to modify its own processes to reflect conditions on the ground. \nRecommendations from the report could provide a reference \npoint for determining how to deal with such countries in the \nCPS process. \n2.  Capacity Development Programming \nIn considering how to move forward with new programming \napproaches, the Pacific department will have to determine \nwhether it views CD as an \u201dadd-on\u201d or as something to be \nmainstreamed into its operations. The case studies offered a mix \nof experiences in this respect, but with the majority treating CD \nas an add-on to support other project objectives. The CDWG \nhas suggested piloting activities leading over time to a more \nmainstreamed approach. \nSpecifically, the CDWG report recommends \u201cusing the new \nconceptual framework and principles on a pilot basis (selecting \none or two key executing agencies per developing member \ncountry) and in sectors in which ADB has a substantial presence, \nsuch as transport, energy, or education.\u201d [ 111 ] The report also \nrecommends a demand-driven approach in the selection of \nkey executing agencies (to ensure ownership), sharing lessons \nfrom the pilots, and supporting a gradual shift in approaches \n(such as by facilitating stakeholder analyses, organizational and \ninstitutional analyses, and establishing performance benchmarks \nand databases). In addition, the report calls for \u201cdisciplined \nanalysis\u201d of executing agency capacity and the roles of other \nstakeholders, including consideration of soft capacities and \nenabling factors. See Appendix 5 for outputs and activities \nspecified in the CDWG report.\nAt ADB\u2019s CD retreat, participants were asked what needs to be \ndone differently to integrate CD more offer effectively in Pacific \noperations.

Others spoke of the need for \nADB to emphasize its role as a development institution, beyond \nthe banking side of its mandate. \nSpecific suggestions from the CD retreat on this topic included \nthe following: \n\u2022\t Commit  more  resources  to  TA  design  and  TA \nimplementation.\n\u2022\t Use a more selective approach in application of \nresources.\n\u2022\t Design CD TA in Pacific countries, not in ADB \nheadquarters in Manila. \n113  ADB 2007b. p. i.\n    Implications for ADB  119", "\u2022\t Encourage joint donor approaches.\n\u2022\t Recognize  and  give  importance  to  CD  in  ADB \ndepartments\u2019 work plans. \n\u2022\t Rely on staff with Pacific and CD experience.\n\u2022\t Encourage  application  of  innovative  tools  for \nmobilization  of  consultants  (e.g.,  framework  or \nindefinite delivery contracts).\n\u2022\t Streamline access to funds.\n\u2022\t Use flexible and adaptive designs that allow changes \nthrough the implementation phase.\n\u2022\t Do not lose sight of the value of small, flexible, rapid \nTA to respond to urgent capacity needs. \n\u2022\t Strengthen  national  consulting  capacity  in  the \nPacific. \n\u2022\t Re-examine internal incentives; accountability and \nrewards should be for outcomes, not loan designs or \nprogramming. \n\u2022\t Seek board and management approval (exception) \nto fund Pacific country strategies rather than TA for \nweakly performing Pacific countries.\nBox 9 provides a summary of the capacity development \nimplications for ADB\u2019s businesses processes and internal support \nsystems.\nBox 9:   Summary of Implications for the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \nBusiness Processes and Internal Support Systems\n\u00bb  Strengthen internal capacity for capacity development \nprogramming in relevant areas, such as results-based \nmanagement systems, staff skills and incentives, human \nresource management, accountability and reporting, \nknowledge management, and demand orientation. \n\u00bb  Examine options for modifying consultant recruitment and \nselection, including increasing the role of Pacific country \npartners. \n\u00bb  Consider options for Pacific island consultant rosters and \nreliance on framework agreements.\n 120  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "ReFeRenCeS AnD ADDItIonAl \nSouRCe MAteRIAl\nAsian Development Bank. 2002.

This will also help to ensure \nready access to relevant materials and stakeholders for the researcher(s). \nAs the points above suggest, the cases selected (notably the more successful ones) will reflect \nsituations where developing-country partners have given systematic attention to capacity issues \nand have demonstrated a clear sense of leadership or ownership.  The cases will also look \nbeyond the usual \u201chard\u201d capacity issues (e.g., skills, organizational structures, etc.) and draw \nout the significance of \u201csoft\u201d capacities (e.g., leadership, strength of community organization, \nrelationships, legitimacy) to success.\n114  ADB defines capacity development as \u201cthe process whereby people, organizations, and society as a whole, unleash, strengthen, create, adapt, \nand maintain capacity over time.\u201d\n 130  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "The field work for the case studies will be guided by a series of questions (see Appendix 2). In \nan overall sense though, the research will test this basic hypothesis: \n \nProspects for developing or effectively utilizing domestic capacity are enhanced when a) \ncapacity issues (individual, organizational and institutional) are addressed systematically \nand on an ongoing basis, and b) the approach to CD is rooted in host country vision and leadership.  \n \nThe findings from the various case studies (e.g., what makes for \u201cgood practice\u201d, the reasons \nfor success) will be distilled in a final report with a view to providing guidance to ADB and all \ndevelopment partners to improve future assistance for capacity development in the region.\nThe consultants will be hired for a period of up to six weeks, on an intermittent basis, commencing \nas soon as possible, with a completion date of 18 May 2007. S/he will be expected to undertake a \nreview of the relevant documentation, followed by interviews and other field work in the relevant \ncountry after which s/he will submit a draft report and participate in a \u201cwriteshop\u201d tentatively \nscheduled to be held in Manila during the second half of April. A final report will be prepared \nsubsequent to the writeshop and provision of feedback from ADB and the team leader for the \nstudy. The field work will require a period of up to 1 month. (The precise number of days required \nwill be determined, in part, by the number of cases involved). The remaining time in the contract \nwill be for a) attendance at the writeshop, and b) follow up work subsequent to the writeshop on \nissues requiring further investigation. \nThe team leader for the broader ADB initiative is Joe Bolger, a Canadian-based ADB-funded \nconsultant with considerable experience in the South Pacific (e-mail: jbolger@videotron.ca tel/\nfax:(613) 446-1080). He will oversee and support the work of the Pacific Islands consultants \nengaged to prepare the case studies. The task manager is Stephen J. Pollard, principal economist, \nADB (e-mail: spollard@adb.org, tel (632) 632-5784). A panel of other international consultants \nwill also support the work.\n \n The consultant will undertake the following specific tasks:\n(i)  Review relevant documentation pertaining to CD in the country being studied. This \nwill include PDMC national and sectoral plans, strategies, evaluations, and reviews. \n(ii)  Review relevant ADB corporate documents relating to CD and technical assistance \n(TA). \n(iii) Review other relevant development partner CD documentation (e.g., research studies, \nevaluations) pertaining to the country in question. \n(iv)  Identify key principal(s) responsible for helping develop capacity in the example to \nbe studied.\n(v)  Conduct a field study on CD in sector x in country y based on the questionnaire \nand framework developed for this study (see Appendix 2). The field study will \ninclude interviews and focus groups (as appropriate) with relevant stakeholders \nand key informants; e.g., government partners, private sector interests, civil society \nAppendix 3  131", "organizations, academics, development partners. The researcher will also endeavor \nto secure personal reflections from key practitioners who have been involved in CD \ninitiatives.\n(vi)  Prepare a paper (20\u201325 pages) which will include a background section describing, \namong other things, the origins of the initiative(s) studied and the context in which \nthey were implemented, as well as a detailed analysis of key issues and lessons \nlearned with respect to capacity development. Consistent with the emphasis in the \nstudy noted above, particular attention will be given to PDMC strategies for CD, the \ninfluence of local ownership, leadership, participation, and demand on the initiative. \nIn addition, the paper will identify themes, practices, and principles that might guide \nfuture CD in the Pacific. (Note: additional information will be provided to guide the \nresearch, including ADB\u2019s CD framework and other relevant literature on capacity \ndevelopment from the international development community.) \noutput, Report Requirements\nA draft report will be submitted to ADB by early to mid-March, and will be finalized by 30 April \n2007, reflecting feedback from ADB, including the team leader, the task manager, CD panelists, \nand writeshop participants. \nPlaces of Assignment\nThe documentation review will primarily be conducted at home office. Initial briefings by the \nteam leader will be by telephone and via e-mail exchanges. The consultant will either work in \nor visit the relevant country in February-April 2007 and complete preparation of the report at \nhome office. \nNote: These terms of reference may be amended either before or during the study based on \nanticipated feedback from development partners, CD panelists, and Pacific specialists.\n 132  LEARNING FROM SUCCESS", "APPenDIx 4\nCAPACIty DeVeloPMent \u2013 PoSSIBle APPRoACHeS [ 115 ]\nPros Cons / Risks\nA.    technical \nAssistance \n(expert \nAdvisors)\n\u0083  Long-term international  \u2013  provides continuity, enhances prospects of  \u2013  risks increasing dependency\nadvisor (resident in  building solid relationships and understanding  \u2013  may be question of accountability to whom \u2013 \ncountry) \u2013 advisory role  the local context contractor?
