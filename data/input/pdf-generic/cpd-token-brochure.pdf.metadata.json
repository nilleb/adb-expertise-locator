Use of the token \nsigni\ufb01es that you have read, \nunderstood, and accepted the \nTerms and Conditions.\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n\nKeep your token secure. Write down \nyour token details and keep it in a \nsafe place to avoid unauthorized \nuse. \n\nDo not share your PIN with anyone.\n\nImmediately report a lost or \ndefective token.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ5\n\nWhy do I need a security token?\nThe security token will serve as your digital \nsignature for approving WAs online. The security \ntoken electronically authenticates the \nWA Approver\u2019s identity.\n\nWhat is a One-Time PIN (OTP)?\nAn OTP is an authentication code generated by the \ntoken that is valid for only one transaction or session. \nThe authentication code expires after 2 minutes.\n\nWhat happens if the OTP expires or if \nI entered an incorrect OTP?\nThe WA Approver will need to reauthenticate \nor generate another code to proceed with the \ntransaction.\n\nDoes my security token require an\nInternet connection? \nNo. The device generates an authentication \ncode even without an Internet connection.\n\nWill the battery run out on the \nsecurity token?\nYes. The token has a 5-year battery life. If it runs \nout of power, do not attempt to replace the \nbattery. Instead, report it as a defective token and \nrequest replacement. \n\nFor more information, e-mail\nadbcpd@adb.org\nor call CPD help desk\n+63 2 632 4422\n\nController\u2019s Department\n\n  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n\n\u00a9 2016 ADB.
