Establishment of Cross-border Settlement \nInfrastructure Forum (CSIF) was endorsed at the meeting of Finance Ministers and Central \nBank Governors of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) held in Delhi in May 2013 \nto facilitate discussion on the improvement of cross-border bond and cash settlement \ninfrastructure in the region, including the possibility of establishing an RSI. The CSIF aims \nto: (a) enhance dialogue among policy makers and operators of bond and cash settlement \ninfrastructure in the region; (b) assess the existing settlement infrastructure and identify \ncomprehensive issues and requirements to facilitate cross-border bond and cash settlement \ninfrastructure in the region; (c) develop common basic principles for cross-border bond and \ncash settlement infrastructure with a medium- and long-term perspective; and (d) discuss \nprospective models, overall roadmap and implementation plan for establishment of cross-\nborder bond and cash settlement infrastructure in the region. Central Banks and national \nCentral Securities Depositories (CSD) participate in the CSIF on a voluntary basis. The CSIF \nreports to the ABMI (TF4).\nThe feasibility of two RSI models, i.e., \u201cAsian ICSD and \u201cCSD Linkage,\u201d were analyzed by the \nGOE in previous studies and discussed by the TF4. The Asian ICSD is intended to operate \nsecurities and multicurrency cash accounts as an independent institution with a banking \nfunction. In the CSD Linkage model, national CSDs are linked to enable access to local \nbonds, in which cash is settled through correspondent banks. Many members of the CSIF \nstressed the difficulties and cost issues of establishing the Asian ICSD as a new institution. \nMost members considered that linking existing infrastructure in a flexible way would be an \nachievable model for cross-border settlement infrastructure in the short and medium term. \nA third, new model, \u201cCSD-RTGS Linkage\u201d was proposed, which connects national CSDs \nand real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems operated by Central Banks. This enables the \nlocal bonds to be settled in Delivery versus Payment (DVP) via central bank money, which \nensures safety of settlement and is compliant with the international standards as well as \nbeing cost\u00a0efficient.\nvi", "Executive Summary\u2003vii\nThe three models are illustrated here.\nAsian ICSD CSD Linkage CSD-RTGS Linkage\nCountry A Country A Country A\nCorrespondent\nCSD\nBank\nCSD\nCustodian Bank CSD RTGS\nICSD\nCorrespondent Correspondent RTGS RTGS\nBank Bank\nCustodian Bank CSD CSD\nCSD CSD\nCSD CSD\nCountry C Country B Country C Country B Country C Country B\nCross-border access to local bonds Cross-border access to local bonds Cross-border access to local bonds\nThroughD tVhP ein  dpriisvcatue sbsaniok nm oonney RSI options, the CSIF identified the following basic prDiVnPc iinp cleenstr ainl b ank money\nplanning and designing the RSI for the region. \nPrinciple 1:   Domesticity and cost efficiency: Maximize utilization of existing cash and \nbond settlement infrastructure. \nPrinciple 2:   Safety:  As  recommended  in  the  \u201cPrinciples  for  financial  market \ninfrastructures,\u201d cash settlement should use central bank money where \npractical and available.\nPrinciple 3:   Flexibility: Allow newcomers to join when market is reasonably developed \nand ready.\nPrinciple 4:  A  ccessibility:  Structure  that  small-  and  medium-size  local  financial \ninstitutions can benefit (not just for major and global players). \nPrinciple 5:   Gradual  integration:  Start  from  bilateral  links.

Therefore, cooperation and coordinating efforts will be undertaken to \nensure that initiatives under the CSIF are aligned with other initiatives in the region, including \nthose of the WC-PSS. \nRecommendations and Next Steps:\n(i)  Based on the analysis, the CSIF recommends the following.\n(a)   Each economy in the region is encouraged to establish cross-border bilateral \nlinkages of national CSDs and RTGS systems when respective markets are \nsufficiently developed, infrastructures are ready to link each other and the \nlinkages will bring significant benefits to the home economies.\n(b)  In establishing the bilateral linkages, each economy in the region should apply \nthe Basic Principles on establishing RSI.\n(c)   Through, and in parallel with, works to establish the bilateral linkages, each \neconomy should continue efforts to facilitate standardization, harmonization of \nrule and regulation as appropriate which would increase transactions and cost-\nefficiency of cross-border bonds transactions in the region.\n(d)  As long-term perspective, practical integrated solution should also be considered \nassuming that the number of bilateral linkages would increase to the extent that \nintegrated model is viable.\n(ii)   In order to facilitate relevant works in accordance with the recommendation above, \nthe CSIF shall develop implementation plan in the next step. As way forward, the \nCSIF should conduct comprehensive analysis to identify necessary requirements \nof the gateway and of others for CSD-RTGS linkages. In doing this, desktop study \nof bilateral CSD-RTGS linkage covering legal, technical and operational aspect by \nvolunteering members could be efficient to check viability and feasibility of the model. \nA basic guideline for CSD-RTGS linkages could be developed based on identified \nrequirements by the comprehensive analysis.\n(iii)  Along with the study above, the CSIF shall develop implementation roadmap of \nCSD-RTGS linkages as short-term and medium-term goal (by 2018) and integrated \nsolution in accordance with the eight principles as long-term goal (around 2020).\n(iv)  In  order  to  implement  the  cross-border  settlement  facility,  standardization  of \nmessage flows and items is essential. The ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF), \nSubforum 2 (SF2) has been conducting extensive study on standardization of bond \ntransaction to facilitate cross-border STP in the region. Although target area to be \nstandardized between the ABMF SF2 and the CSIF is different, close communication \nand collaboration among the two forums is desirable to achieve wider-range of \nstandardization and further efficiency.

In April 2010, the Group \nof Experts (GOE) published a report that analyzed the legal and business feasibility \nof the RSI models. \nSince that time, the GOE has made a reassessment of the business feasibility of RSI models, \nwhich it completed at the end of 2012. In Delhi in May 2013, the Finance Ministers and \nCentral Bank Governors of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) agreed to set up \na Cross-border Settlement Infrastructure Forum (CSIF) to discuss detailed work plans and \nrelated processes for improvement of cross-border settlement in the region, which included \nthe possibility of establishing an RSI.

The CSD Linkage is modeled after the Link Up Markets.1 The \nmain operational specifications are shown as follows:\n(i)   CSD  linkage  infrastructure  acts  as  communication  and  information  platform \nconnecting CSDs, routing and converting messages.\n(ii)  Foreign CSDs are allowed to open accounts at domestic CSD.\n(iii)  Core settlement services include securities and cash processing in DVP in issuer \nmarket, following existing local DVP process of issuer CSD. \n(iv) Require cash leg in commercial bank money provided by cash respondent bank.\n(v)   All currencies of issuer CSD markets are available, provided those currencies are fully \nconvertible.\n1  The Link Up Markets were launched by multiple European CSDs in 2008. ", "Overview of RSI Models\u20035\nCSD-RTGS Linkage Model \nThe CSD-RTGS Linkage is based on three key features\u2014efficiency, safety, and compatibility. \nThe first, \u201cefficiency,\u201d is achieved by utilizing national CSDs. Many Asian economies already \nhave developed online-based national payment and settlement infrastructure. National \nCSDs that have a large potential investor base could provide expanded opportunities for \ncross-border  investment  to  small-  or  medium-sized  financial  institutions  in  the  local \nlanguage. As such, the use of national CSDs would have the potential to be a cost-effective \nsolution for cross-border securities settlement for a wider range of investors. \nFigure 4.\u2003Efficiency of Utilizing National CSDs\nCountry A Country B\nIssuer ICSD Mainly \nGlobal Custodian Large FI\nCSD Wide\nRange of\nInvestor Small/Medium  Investors\nCSD FI\nExpanded opportunity to \ninvest foreign bonds\nSecondly, \u201csafety\u201d of settlement can be secured by using central bank money. Principle 9 \nof the \u201cPrinciples for financial market infrastructures\u201d of the Committee on Payment and \nSettlement Systems and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of \nSecurities Commissions articulates that \u201can FMI should conduct its money settlements \nin central bank money where practical and available. If central bank money is not used, an \nFMI should minimize and strictly control the credit and liquidity risk arising from the use \nof commercial bank money.\u201d2 While private institutions (ICSDs/ custodians/ correspondent \nbanks) continue to improve their services for cross-border settlement, considering stressed \nsituations, it would be necessary to explore a safer substituted system which maintains \nfunctioning even in crisis. If local currencies of ASEAN+3 are involved in cross-border \nsettlement, providing market participants with an option to use central bank money (central \nbank RTGS systems) would contribute to create further robust financial system in the region.\nThirdly, a model that demonstrates \u201ccompatibility\u201d could be the most suitable solution for \nAsian economies with different stages of market development. Given the diversity among \nthe financial markets of the region, and the many differences regarding currency, market \nopenness, legal aspects, local practices, infrastructure, etc., there cannot really be a \u201cone-size-\nfits-all\u201d solution for establishing a cross-border settlement infrastructure/system. Therefore, \na rather flexible and practical solution would be ideal that gives options to each ASEAN+3 \neconomy, firstly, to participate in a regional framework at its own appropriate timing, taking \ninto account its progress of domestic market reform and secondly, to continue to use existing \n2  http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss101a.pdf", "6\u2003Basic Principles on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and Next Steps Forward\ninfrastructure/systems, which could be co-existing with the regional framework. This solution \nwould facilitate a broader harmonization among relevant parties aiming for middle-/long-\nterm goal of the region. \nThe CSD-RTGS Linkage model is based on a bilateral connection between two markets. By \nconnecting national CSDs and RTGS systems operated by Central Banks, the CSD-RTGS \nLinkage will facilitate:\n(i)  funding of foreign currency using local bonds as collateral (e.g., cross-currency repo),\n(ii)  issuance of Eurobond (e.g., Dim sum bond, Shogun bond), and\n(iii) cross-border investment in local bonds.\nFigure 5.\u2003CSD-RTGS Linkage Model\nCross-border link\nCountry A CountryB\nParticipant Central Bank  PVP Central Bank  Participant\nRTGS (A) RTGS (B)\nCross-\nDVP currency DVP\nDVP \nParticipant CSD (A) CSD Link CSD (B) Participant\nCSD-RTGS Linkage adopts a \u201cflexible implementation\u201d approach.

A GW is network equipment (a small device) with functions such as network \nconnection and message conversion. The general concept of a GW is as follows:\n(i)  \u201cequal footing\u201d linkage for all countries, with no central hub; and\n(ii)  \u201cflexibility\u201d in the number of GWs in a country (e.g., free option for each country).", "Overview of RSI Models\u20037\nFigure 7.\u2003CSD-RTGS Gateway Function\nCountry A Country B\nParticipant Central  Central  Participant\nBank  Bank \nParticipant RTGS RTGS Participant\nGW GW\nParticipant Participant\nCSD CSD\nParticipant Participant\nParticipant\nA small device for GW CSD\n\u2022 network connection Participant\n\u2022 message conversion\nStandardization of \nGW GW\nmessage format is key \nCountry C\nfor low initial cost  Participant Central  Participant\nCSD Bank \nof GW\nParticipant RTGS Participant\nStandardization of the message format is key in maintaining a low initial cost for the GW. \nStandardization of settlement flow is also an important element to minimize information \ntechnology (IT) cost for GW development. One possible example of such standardization \nof settlement flow is to adopt the widely used DVP mechanism (e.g., holding/earmarking/\nblocking securities before funds transfer) for the cross-border/cross-currency DVP link. The \ncross-border/cross-currency DVP link for settlement flow is illustrated in Attachment 2.", "Salient Points of Discussion on RSI\nGeneral Shared Views\nCircumstances surrounding bond market infrastructure were shared by members. Authorities, \noperators of financial market infrastructure and market participants of bond markets in the \nregion have been undertaking a variety of measures to reduce risk and increase efficiency \nby introducing dematerialization (or immobilization) of securities, RTGS, DVP, PVP and \nso on. However, there remains room for improvement in terms of safety and efficiency for \ncross-border securities settlement. There are also increasing demands for reliable collateral \nand financing of local currencies for nonresidents utilizing fixed income instruments; this is \na reflection of both the recent global financial crisis and regulatory reforms, as well as the \ngood potential for growth within the ASEAN+3 economies. With regard to IT developments, \nthere is some trend to migrate the message standard in many economies to be compatible \nwith international standards, in particular ISO 20022, in order to promote, or in view of the \nneed for, cross-border infrastructure linkages. Members also mentioned the importance of \nreducing the high transaction costs of using European ICSDs and global custodians as well \nas mitigating credit and foreign exchange settlement risks by establishing safer and more \nefficient cross-border settlement facilities in the region. \nDiscussions on RSI Options\nSharing the general views above, members also exchanged thoughts on RSI options. The \ndiscussions mainly focused on the comparison between the Asian ICSD and CSD-RTGS \nLinkage models; the CSD Linkage model was considered to have challenges regarding cash \nsettlement and liquidity that could be better addressed by the CSD-RTGS Linkage model.\nMany members opined on the challenges of establishing the Asian ICSD as a new institution. \nThese included challenges in ensuring the safety of settlements, such as access to central \nbank credit/liquidity facilities in jurisdictions other than the location of the Asian ICSD. \nIn addition, many economies restrict settlement of their local currencies outside their \neconomies for the purpose of capital control. Even in the jurisdiction where the Asian ICSD \nwould obtain a banking license, access to central bank credit/liquidity facilities might be \nlimited to the currency of that jurisdiction. Another issue is cost: the Asian ICSD should be \nable to satisfy high levels of capital requirements as a banking entity and would also involve \nhigh IT development costs, both of which were viewed as not practical to the region. \nMost  members  viewed  the  CSD-RTGS  Linkage  as  a  prospective  model  for  the  RSI. \nFirstly, linking existing infrastructure in a flexible way was perceived as an achievable and \nefficient model for cross-border infrastructure of the region from short and medium term \n8", "Salient Points of Discussion on RSI\u20039\nperspective. Secondly, the CSD-RTGS Linkage model enables cross-border/cross-currency \nbond settlement in DVP with central bank money, which would mitigate settlement risks \nand ensure the safety of settlement. Safety of settlement would in turn encourage cross-\nborder bond transactions and investments within the region. In this connection, some \nmembers addressed the importance of local currency settled domestically. Thirdly, the \nCSD-RTGS Linkage model would be consistent with other regional initiatives. The ASEAN \nWorking Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (WC-PSS) has set infrastructure \nlinkages between the member countries as a long-term goal beyond 2015 in the roadmap \ntoward ASEAN Financial Integration. Finally, standardization and harmonization of rules and \nregulations are identified as important elements to establish an RSI and foster cross-border \nbond transactions. CSD-RTGS Linkage was found to be the model that, overall, could take \nall of these various elements into account in establishing an RSI from its concept of GW to \nmake bilateral linkage possible.\nBasic Principles on Establishing an RSI \nThrough the discussions on RSI options, the CSIF identified the following basic principles in \nplanning and designing the RSI for the region. \nPrinciple 1:   Domesticity and cost efficiency: Maximize utilization of existing cash and \nbond settlement infrastructure. \nPrinciple 2:   Safety:  As  recommended  in  the  \u201cPrinciples  for  financial  market \ninfrastructures,\u201d cash settlement should use central bank money where \npractical and available.\nPrinciple 3:   Flexibility: Allow newcomers to join when market is reasonably developed \nand ready.\nPrinciple 4:  A  ccessibility:  Structure  that  small-  and  medium-sized  local  financial \ninstitutions can benefit (not just for major and global players). \nPrinciple 5:   Gradual  integration:  Start  from  bilateral  links.  Explore  possibility  of \ncentralized integration as long-term goal.\nPrinciple 6:   Consistency  and  collaboration  with  other  initiatives:  Explore  greater \nbenefit by maintaining consistency and collaboration with other initiatives of \nthe region. \nPrinciple 7:   Standardization: Standardize market practices and technical aspects among \nmembers as much as possible to minimize costs.\nPrinciple 8:   Harmonization of rules and regulations: Harmonize rules and regulations \nas much as practical which hinder cross-border transaction. Regulations that \nrequire holistic policy considerations such as capital control, taxation, etc., \nare taken as given.\nThe CSIF considered that the CSD-RTGS Linkage model best fits with and could follow the \nbasic principles identified above. A comparison of the RSI options with the basic principles \nis summarized in Attachment 3.", "10\u2003Basic Principles on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and Next Steps Forward\nThe majority of the CSIF member countries are involved in the ASEAN WC-PSS, which aims \nto facilitate more efficient access to issuers and investors to tap the ASEAN capital markets \nfor equities and government and corporate bonds. Therefore, cooperation and coordinating \nefforts will be undertaken to ensure that initiatives under the CSIF are aligned with other \ninitiatives in the region, including those of the WC-PSS. ", "Recommendations and Next Steps\nRecommendations\nBased on the discussions, the CSIF recommends the following.\n(i)   Each economy in the region is encouraged to establish cross-border bilateral linkages \nof  national  CSDs  and  RTGS  systems  when  respective  markets  are  sufficiently \ndeveloped, infrastructures are ready to link each other and the linkages will bring \nsignificant benefits to the home economies.\n(ii)   In establishing the bilateral linkages, each economy in the region should apply the \nBasic Principles on establishing RSI.\n(iii)  Through, and in parallel with, works to establish the bilateral linkages, each economy \nshould continue efforts to facilitate standardization, harmonization of rule and \nregulation as appropriate which would increase transactions and cost-efficiency of \ncross-border bonds transactions in the region.\n(iv) A  s long-term perspective, practical integrated solution should also be considered \nassuming that the number of bilateral linkages would increase to the extent that \nintegrated model is viable. \nNext Steps\nIn order to facilitate relevant works in accordance with the recommendations above, the CSIF \nshall develop implementation plan. As way forward, the CSIF should conduct comprehensive \nanalysis to identify necessary requirements of the gateway and of others for CSD-RTGS \nlinkages. In doing this, desktop study of bilateral CSD-RTGS linkage covering legal, technical \nand operational aspect by volunteering members could be efficient to check viability and \nfeasibility of the model. A basic guideline for CSD-RTGS linkages could be developed based \non identified requirements by the comprehensive analysis.\nAlong with the study above, the CSIF shall develop  implementation roadmap of CSD-\nRTGS linkages as short-term and medium-term goal (by 2018) and integrated solution in \naccordance with the eight principles as long-term goal (around 2020).\nIn order to implement the above cross-border settlement facility, standardization of message \nflows and items is essential. The ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF), Subforum 2 (SF2) \nhas been conducting extensive study on standardization of bond transaction to facilitate \ncross-border STP in the region. Although target area to be standardized between the ABMF \nSF2 and the CSIF is different, close communication and collaboration among the two forums \nis desirable to achieve wider-range of standardization and further efficiency. \n11", "Attachments\nAttachment 1:\u2002Members, Observers, and Secretariat\nCountry Institution Name\nEddie Mardini\nNurhuaida Fakhriah Damit\nBRU Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam  Noor Aznah Nayan\nLim Shaw Fhen\nKasiani Kassim\nCheng Shigang \nThe People\u2019s Bank of China\nWeihua Zhang\nPRC\nRuixing Fan\nChina Central Depository and Clearing \nJun Cao\nShu-pui Li\nHKG Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFlora Wong\nAnton Daryono\nINO Bank Indonesia Jultarda Hutagalung\nHimawan Kusprianto\nJunichi Suzuki\nHiroyuki Nishizawa\nBank of Japan\nMegumi Takei\nJPN Takahito Yamada\nHiroshi Ikegami\nJapan Securities Depository Center\nYuji Sato\nMinistry of Finance, Japan Kazuo Kobayashi\nJisung Ko\nBank of Korea\nLee Byoung Mok\nJong-hyung Lee\nByong Kil Choi\nYoung Ho Park\nKOR Euin Jin Kwon\nKorea Securities Depository The Whan Lim\nSo Yeon Kim\nYou Na Im\nByoungkook Kim\nYe Ji Shin\ncontinued on next page\n12", "Attachments\u200313\nCountry Institution Name\nJi-Young Choi\nKOR Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Korea SangYong Lee\nHohyun Jang\nMinistry of Finance, Lao People\u2019s Democratic  Boualith Khounsy\nLAO Republic\nChanpasith Sengphaathith\nMAL Bank Negara Malaysia Aden Nadia Jabbari\nBella S.
