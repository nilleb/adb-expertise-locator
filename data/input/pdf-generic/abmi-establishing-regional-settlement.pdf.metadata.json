Establishment  of  Cross-border  Settlement \nInfrastructure Forum (CSIF) was endorsed at the meeting of Finance Ministers and Central \nBank  Governors  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) held in Delhi in May 2013 \nto  facilitate  discussion  on  the  improvement  of  cross-border  bond  and  cash  settlement \ninfrastructure in the region, including the possibility of establishing an RSI. The CSIF aims \nto: (a) enhance dialogue among policy makers and operators of bond and cash settlement \ninfrastructure  in  the  region;  (b)  assess  the  existing  settlement  infrastructure  and  identify \ncomprehensive issues and requirements to facilitate cross-border bond and cash settlement \ninfrastructure in the region; (c) develop common basic principles for cross-border bond and \ncash settlement infrastructure with a medium- and long-term perspective; and (d) discuss \nprospective models, overall roadmap and implementation plan for establishment of cross-\nborder  bond  and  cash  settlement  infrastructure  in  the  region.  Central  Banks  and  national \nCentral Securities Depositories (CSD) participate in the CSIF on a voluntary basis. The CSIF \nreports to the ABMI (TF4).\n\nThe feasibility of two RSI models, i.e., \u201cAsian ICSD and \u201cCSD Linkage,\u201d were analyzed by the \nGOE in previous studies and discussed by the TF4. The Asian ICSD is intended to operate \nsecurities  and  multicurrency  cash  accounts  as  an  independent  institution  with  a  banking \nfunction.  In  the  CSD  Linkage  model,  national  CSDs  are  linked  to  enable  access  to  local \nbonds, in which cash is settled through correspondent banks. Many members of the CSIF \nstressed the difficulties and cost issues of establishing the Asian ICSD as a new institution. \n\nMost members considered that linking existing infrastructure in a flexible way would be an \nachievable model for cross-border settlement infrastructure in the short and medium term. \nA  third,  new  model,  \u201cCSD-RTGS  Linkage\u201d  was  proposed,  which  connects  national  CSDs \nand real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems operated by Central Banks. This enables the \nlocal bonds to be settled in Delivery versus Payment (DVP) via central bank money, which \nensures  safety  of  settlement  and  is  compliant  with  the  international  standards  as  well  as \nbeing cost\u00a0efficient.\n\nvi\n\n\fExecutive Summary\u2003vii\n\nThe three models are illustrated here.\n\nAsian ICSD\nCountry A\n\nCSD Linkage\nCountry A\n\nCSD-RTGS Linkage\nCountry A\n\nCorrespondent\nBank\n\nCSD\n\nCustodian Bank\n\nICSD\n\nCorrespondent\nBank\n\nCustodian Bank\n\nCorrespondent\nBank\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nRTGS\n\nRTGS\n\nRTGS\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCountry C\n\nCountry B\n\nCountry C\n\nCountry B\n\nCountry C\n\nCountry B\n\nCross-border access to local bonds\n\nCross-border access to local bonds\n\nCross-border access to local bonds\n\nDVP in private bank money\n\nThrough the discussion on RSI options, the CSIF identified the following basic principles in \nplanning and designing the RSI for the region. \n\nDVP in central bank money\n\nPrinciple 1: \n\n Domesticity and cost efficiency: Maximize utilization of existing cash and \nbond settlement infrastructure. \n\nPrinciple 2:   Safety:  As \n\nrecommended \n\nfor  financial  market \ninfrastructures,\u201d  cash  settlement  should  use  central  bank  money  where \npractical and available.\n\nin  the  \u201cPrinciples \n\nPrinciple 3: \n\n Flexibility: Allow newcomers to join when market is reasonably developed \nand ready.\n\nPrinciple 4:   Accessibility:  Structure  that  small-  and  medium-size \n\nlocal  financial \n\ninstitutions can benefit (not just for major and global players). \n\nPrinciple 5: \n\n Gradual  integration:  Start  from  bilateral \ncentralized integration as long-term goal.\n\nlinks.  Explore  possibility  of \n\nPrinciple 6:   Consistency  and  collaboration  with  other  initiatives:  Explore  greater \nbenefit by maintaining consistency and collaboration with other initiatives of \nthe region. \n\nPrinciple 7: \n\n Standardization: Standardize market practices and technical aspects among \nmembers as much as possible to minimize costs.\n\nPrinciple 8:   Harmonization of rules and regulations: Harmonize rules and regulations \nas much as practical which hinder cross-border transaction. Regulations that \nrequire holistic policy considerations  such as capital  control, taxation, etc., \nare taken as given.\n\nThe CSIF considered that the CSD-RTGS Linkage best fits with these principles and would \nbe the possible option to pursue further in the next step.\n\n\fviii\u2003Executive Summary\n\nThe majority of the CSIF member countries are involved in the ASEAN Working Committee \non  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems  (WC-PSS),  which  aims  to  facilitate  more  efficient \naccess to issuers and investors to tap the ASEAN capital markets for equities and government \nand corporate bonds. Therefore, cooperation and coordinating efforts will be undertaken to \nensure that initiatives under the CSIF are aligned with other initiatives in the region, including \nthose of the WC-PSS. \n\nRecommendations and Next Steps:\n\n(i)  Based on the analysis, the CSIF recommends the following.\n\n(a)   Each  economy  in  the  region  is  encouraged  to  establish  cross-border  bilateral \nlinkages  of  national  CSDs  and  RTGS  systems  when  respective  markets  are \nsufficiently  developed,  infrastructures  are  ready  to  link  each  other  and  the \nlinkages will bring significant benefits to the home economies.\n\n(b)   In establishing the bilateral linkages, each economy in the region should apply \n\nthe Basic Principles on establishing RSI.\n\n(c)   Through,  and  in  parallel  with,  works  to  establish  the  bilateral  linkages,  each \neconomy should continue efforts to facilitate standardization, harmonization of \nrule and regulation as appropriate which would increase transactions and cost-\nefficiency of cross-border bonds transactions in the region.\n\n(d)   As long-term perspective, practical integrated solution should also be considered \nassuming that the number of bilateral linkages would increase to the extent that \nintegrated model is viable.\n\n(ii)   In order to facilitate relevant works in accordance with the recommendation above, \nthe  CSIF  shall  develop  implementation  plan  in  the  next  step.  As  way  forward,  the \nCSIF  should  conduct  comprehensive  analysis  to  identify  necessary  requirements \nof  the  gateway  and  of  others  for  CSD-RTGS  linkages.  In  doing  this,  desktop  study \nof  bilateral  CSD-RTGS  linkage  covering  legal,  technical  and  operational  aspect  by \nvolunteering members could be efficient to check viability and feasibility of the model. \nA  basic  guideline  for  CSD-RTGS  linkages  could  be  developed  based  on  identified \nrequirements by the comprehensive analysis.\n\n(iii)   Along  with  the  study  above,  the  CSIF  shall  develop  implementation  roadmap  of \nCSD-RTGS linkages as short-term and medium-term goal (by 2018) and integrated \nsolution in accordance with the eight principles as long-term goal (around 2020).\n\n(iv)  In  order  to  implement  the  cross-border  settlement  facility,  standardization  of \nmessage flows and items is essential. The ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF), \nSubforum 2 (SF2) has been conducting extensive study on standardization of bond \ntransaction to facilitate cross-border STP in the region. Although target area to be \nstandardized between the ABMF SF2 and the CSIF is different, close communication \nand  collaboration  among  the  two  forums  is  desirable  to  achieve  wider-range  of \nstandardization and further efficiency. \n\n\fAbbreviations\n\nABMF \n\nASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum\n\nABMI \n\nAsian Bond Markets Initiative\n\nASEAN \n\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations\n\nCentral Securities Depository\n\nCross-border Settlement Infrastructure Forum\n\nCSD \n\nCSIF \n\nDVP \n\nGOE \n\nGW \n\nIT \n\nRSI \n\nSF \n\nTF \n\nDelivery versus Payment\n\nGroup of Experts\n\nGateway\n\nICSD \n\nInternational Central Securities Depository\n\nInformation Technology\n\nRegional Settlement Intermediary\n\nRTGS \n\nReal Time Gross Settlement\n\nSubforum\n\nTask Force\n\nWC-PSS  Working Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems\n\nix\n\n\f\fIntroduction\n\nThe establishment of a Regional Settlement Intermediary (RSI) has been an issue since \n\nthe inception of the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI). In April 2010, the Group \nof Experts (GOE) published a report that analyzed the legal and business feasibility \n\nof the RSI models. \n\nSince that time, the GOE has made a reassessment of the business feasibility of RSI models, \nwhich  it  completed  at  the  end  of  2012.  In  Delhi  in  May  2013,  the  Finance  Ministers  and \nCentral  Bank  Governors  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) agreed to set up \na Cross-border Settlement Infrastructure Forum (CSIF) to discuss detailed work plans and \nrelated processes for improvement of cross-border settlement in the region, which included \nthe possibility of establishing an RSI. CSIF meetings have been held in Tokyo (Japan, July \n2013), Jeju (Korea, November 2013), and Manila (Philippines, March 2014).\n\n\u201cWe  welcomed  the  completion  of  the  business  feasibility  reassessment  for  the \nestablishment of the Regional Settlement Intermediary (RSI). We agreed to set up a \nCross-border Settlement Infrastructure Forum, which will be based on the voluntary \nparticipation of member countries, to discuss detailed work plans and related process \nfor  the  improvement  of  the  cross-border  settlement  in  the  region  including  the \npossibility of establishing the RSI.\u201d\n\nThe Joint Statement of the 16th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors\u2019 \nMeeting, 3 May 2013, Delhi, India\n\nPurpose and Function of the CSIF\n\nFacilitating  the  establishment  of  an  RSI  is  one  of  nine  priorities  identified  in  the  \u201cNew \nRoadmap+\u201d of the ABMI. More specifically, the CSIF is expected to be a key instrument to \nsupport Task Force 4 (TF4) of the ABMI in facilitating discussion on the improvement of \ncross-border bond and cash settlement infrastructure in the region.\n\nThe CSIF aims to: \n\n(i) \n\n enhance dialogue among policy makers and operators of bond and cash settlement \ninfrastructure in the region; \n\n(ii)   assess the existing settlement infrastructure and identify comprehensive issues and \nrequirements  to  facilitate  cross-border  bond  and  cash  settlement  infrastructure  in \nthe region;\n\n(iii)   develop  common  basic  principles  for  cross-border  bond  and  cash  settlement \n\ninfrastructure with medium- and long-term perspectives; and \n\n1\n\n\f2\u2003Basic Principles on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and Next Steps Forward\n\n(iv)  discuss  prospective  models,  overall  roadmap  and \n\nimplementation  plan  for \nestablishment of cross-border bond and cash settlement infrastructure in the region. \n\nThe CSIF is expected to submit periodic progress reports, a work plan and recommendations \nfor establishment of cross-border bond and cash settlement infrastructure to the ABMI TF4.\n\nMembership and Structure of the CSIF\n\nCentral  Banks  and  national  Central  Securities  Depositories  (CSD)  participate  in  the  CSIF \non a voluntary basis.

The Asian ICSD and \nCSD Linkage are the models that had been previously studied by the GOE. The CSD-\nRTGS Linkage is a model that was proposed by a member as an additional RSI option, and all \nother members supported the conduct of further analysis of this model at the first meeting \nof the\u00a0CSIF. \n\nFigure 2.\u2003RSI Models\n\nAsian ICSD\nCountry A\n\nCSD Linkage\nCountry A\n\nCSD-RTGS Linkage\nCountry A\n\nCorrespondent\nBank\n\nCSD\n\nCustodian Bank\n\nICSD\n\nCorrespondent\nBank\n\nCustodian Bank\n\nCorrespondent\nBank\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nRTGS\n\nRTGS\n\nRTGS\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCSD\n\nCountry C\n\nCountry B\n\nCountry C\n\nCountry B\n\nCountry C\n\nCountry B\n\nCross-border access to local bonds\n\nCross-border access to local bonds\n\nCross-border access to local bonds\n\nDVP in private bank money\n\nDVP in central bank money\n\nAsian ICSD Model\n\nThe  Asian  ICSD  is  intended  to  operate  securities  and  multicurrency  cash  accounts  as  an \nindependent  institution  with  a  banking  function,  modeled  after  other  ICSDs.  The  main \noperational specifications (see Figure 3) are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n delivery versus Payment (DVP) through book-entry settlement of both securities and \ncash within the Asian ICSD, although settlement risk using commercial bank money \nremains;\n\n(ii)   external settlement for securities received from, or delivered to, local markets through \n\ndirect access to local CSD or local custodian bank;\n\n3\n\n\f4\u2003Basic Principles on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and Next Steps Forward\n\nFigure 3.\u2003Asian ICSD Model\n\nInvestor\n\nCustodian\n\nTrade\n\nInvestor\n\nCustodian\n\nSettlement \nInstruction\n\nAsian  ICSD\n\nSettlement \nInstruction\n\nDepending on  \nModel\n\nLocal\ncustodian\n\nLocal\nclearing system\n\nDeposit of Securities\n\nIssuer\n\n(iii)   multicurrency settlement facility through integrated foreign exchange service books \n\nof Asian ICSD;\n\n(iv) operation of credit/liquidity facilities and securities lending/borrowing program;\n\n(v)  operation of collateral management services; and\n\n(vi) operation of principal custodial services.\n\nCSD Linkage Model\n\nIn this model, national CSD are linked to enable access to local bonds, in which cash is settled \nthrough correspondent banks. The CSD Linkage is modeled after the Link Up Markets.1 The \nmain operational specifications are shown as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n CSD  linkage  infrastructure  acts  as  communication  and  information  platform \nconnecting CSDs, routing and converting messages.\n\n(ii)  Foreign CSDs are allowed to open accounts at domestic CSD.\n\n(iii)   Core  settlement  services  include  securities  and  cash  processing  in  DVP  in  issuer \n\nmarket, following existing local DVP process of issuer CSD. \n\n(iv) Require cash leg in commercial bank money provided by cash respondent bank.\n\n(v)   All currencies of issuer CSD markets are available, provided those currencies are fully \n\nconvertible.\n\n1 \n\nThe Link Up Markets were launched by multiple European CSDs in 2008. \n\n\fOverview of RSI Models\u20035\n\nCSD-RTGS Linkage Model \n\nThe CSD-RTGS Linkage is based on three key features\u2014efficiency, safety, and compatibility. \nThe first, \u201cefficiency,\u201d is achieved by utilizing national CSDs. Many Asian economies already \nhave  developed  online-based  national  payment  and  settlement  infrastructure.  National \nCSDs  that  have  a  large  potential  investor  base  could  provide  expanded  opportunities  for \ncross-border  investment  to  small-  or  medium-sized  financial  institutions  in  the  local \nlanguage. As such, the use of national CSDs would have the potential to be a cost-effective \nsolution for cross-border securities settlement for a wider range of investors. \n\nFigure 4.\u2003Efficiency of Utilizing National CSDs\n\nCountry A\n\nIssuer\nCSD\n\nICSD\nGlobal Custodian\n\nCountry B\n\nMainly \nLarge FI\n\nInvestor\nCSD\n\nSmall/Medium \nFI\n\nWide\nRange of\nInvestors\n\nExpanded opportunity to \ninvest foreign bonds\n\nSecondly,  \u201csafety\u201d  of  settlement  can  be  secured  by  using  central  bank  money.  Principle  9 \nof  the  \u201cPrinciples  for  financial  market  infrastructures\u201d  of  the  Committee  on  Payment  and \nSettlement  Systems  and  the  Technical  Committee  of  the  International  Organization  of \nSecurities  Commissions  articulates  that  \u201can  FMI  should  conduct  its  money  settlements \nin central bank money where practical and available. If central bank money is not used, an \nFMI  should  minimize  and  strictly  control  the  credit  and  liquidity  risk  arising  from  the  use \nof commercial bank money.\u201d2 While private institutions (ICSDs/ custodians/ correspondent \nbanks) continue to improve their services for cross-border settlement, considering stressed \nsituations,  it  would  be  necessary  to  explore  a  safer  substituted  system  which  maintains \nfunctioning  even  in  crisis.  If  local  currencies  of  ASEAN+3  are  involved  in  cross-border \nsettlement, providing market participants with an option to use central bank money (central \nbank RTGS systems) would contribute to create further robust financial system in the region.\n\nThirdly, a model that demonstrates \u201ccompatibility\u201d could be the most suitable solution for \nAsian economies with different stages of market development. Given the diversity among \nthe  financial  markets  of  the  region,  and  the  many  differences  regarding  currency,  market \nopenness, legal aspects, local practices, infrastructure, etc., there cannot really be a \u201cone-size-\nfits-all\u201d solution for establishing a cross-border settlement infrastructure/system. Therefore, \na rather flexible and practical solution would be ideal that gives options to each ASEAN+3 \neconomy, firstly, to participate in a regional framework at its own appropriate timing, taking \ninto account its progress of domestic market reform and secondly, to continue to use existing \n\n2 \n\nhttp://www.bis.org/publ/cpss101a.pdf\n\n\f6\u2003Basic Principles on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and Next Steps Forward\n\ninfrastructure/systems, which could be co-existing with the regional framework. This solution \nwould facilitate a broader harmonization  among relevant  parties  aiming for  middle-/long-\nterm goal of the region. \n\nThe CSD-RTGS Linkage model is based on a bilateral connection between two markets.

A  GW  is  network  equipment  (a  small  device)  with  functions  such  as  network \nconnection and message conversion. The general concept of a GW is as follows:\n\n(i)  \u201cequal footing\u201d linkage for all countries, with no central hub; and\n\n(ii)  \u201cflexibility\u201d in the number of GWs in a country (e.g., free option for each country).\n\n\fFigure 7.\u2003CSD-RTGS Gateway Function\n\nCountry A\n\nCountry B\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nCentral \nBank \nRTGS\n\nCSD\n\nGW\n\nA small device for\n\u2022 network connection\n\u2022 message conversion\n\nOverview of RSI Models\u20037\n\nCentral \nBank \nRTGS\n\nCSD\n\nGW\n\nGW\n\nCSD\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nStandardization of \nmessage format is key \nfor low initial cost \nof GW\n\nGW\n\nCSD\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nGW\n\nCentral \nBank \nRTGS\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nCountry C\n\nStandardization of the message format is key in maintaining a low initial cost for the GW. \nStandardization  of  settlement  flow  is  also  an  important  element  to  minimize  information \ntechnology (IT) cost for GW development. One possible example of such standardization \nof settlement flow is to adopt the widely used DVP mechanism (e.g., holding/earmarking/\nblocking securities before funds transfer) for the cross-border/cross-currency DVP link. The \ncross-border/cross-currency DVP link for settlement flow is illustrated in Attachment 2.\n\n\fSalient Points of Discussion on RSI\n\nGeneral Shared Views\n\nCircumstances surrounding bond market infrastructure were shared by members. Authorities, \noperators of financial market infrastructure and market participants of bond markets in the \nregion have been undertaking a variety of measures to reduce risk and increase efficiency \nby  introducing  dematerialization  (or  immobilization)  of  securities,  RTGS,  DVP,  PVP  and \nso on. However, there remains room for improvement in terms of safety and efficiency for \ncross-border securities settlement. There are also increasing demands for reliable collateral \nand financing of local currencies for nonresidents utilizing fixed income instruments; this is \na reflection of both the recent global financial crisis and regulatory reforms, as well as the \ngood potential for growth within the ASEAN+3 economies. With regard to IT developments, \nthere is some trend to migrate the message standard in many economies to be compatible \nwith international standards, in particular ISO 20022, in order to promote, or in view of the \nneed for, cross-border infrastructure linkages. Members also mentioned the importance of \nreducing the high transaction costs of using European ICSDs and global custodians as well \nas  mitigating  credit  and  foreign  exchange  settlement  risks  by  establishing  safer  and  more \nefficient cross-border settlement facilities in the region. \n\nDiscussions on RSI Options\n\nSharing  the  general  views  above,  members  also  exchanged  thoughts  on  RSI  options.  The \ndiscussions  mainly  focused  on  the  comparison  between  the  Asian  ICSD  and  CSD-RTGS \nLinkage models; the CSD Linkage model was considered to have challenges regarding cash \nsettlement and liquidity that could be better addressed by the CSD-RTGS Linkage model.\n\nMany members opined on the challenges of establishing the Asian ICSD as a new institution. \nThese included challenges in ensuring the safety of settlements, such as access to central \nbank  credit/liquidity  facilities  in  jurisdictions  other  than  the  location  of  the  Asian  ICSD. \nIn  addition,  many  economies  restrict  settlement  of  their  local  currencies  outside  their \neconomies for the purpose of capital control. Even in the jurisdiction where the Asian ICSD \nwould  obtain  a  banking  license,  access  to  central  bank  credit/liquidity  facilities  might  be \nlimited to the currency of that jurisdiction. Another issue is cost: the Asian ICSD should be \nable to satisfy high levels of capital requirements as a banking entity and would also involve \nhigh IT development costs, both of which were viewed as not practical to the region. \n\nMost  members  viewed  the  CSD-RTGS  Linkage  as  a  prospective  model  for  the  RSI. \nFirstly,  linking  existing  infrastructure  in  a  flexible  way  was  perceived  as  an  achievable  and \nefficient model for cross-border infrastructure of the region from short and medium term \n\n8\n\n\fSalient Points of Discussion on RSI\u20039\n\nperspective. Secondly, the CSD-RTGS Linkage model enables cross-border/cross-currency \nbond  settlement  in  DVP  with  central  bank  money,  which  would  mitigate  settlement  risks \nand  ensure  the  safety  of  settlement.  Safety  of  settlement  would  in  turn  encourage  cross-\nborder  bond  transactions  and  investments  within  the  region.  In  this  connection,  some \nmembers  addressed  the  importance  of  local  currency  settled  domestically.  Thirdly,  the \nCSD-RTGS Linkage model would be consistent with other regional initiatives. The ASEAN \nWorking Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (WC-PSS) has set infrastructure \nlinkages between the member countries as a long-term goal beyond 2015 in the roadmap \ntoward ASEAN Financial Integration. Finally, standardization and harmonization of rules and \nregulations are identified as important elements to establish an RSI and foster cross-border \nbond transactions. CSD-RTGS Linkage was found to be the model that, overall, could take \nall of these various elements into account in establishing an RSI from its concept of GW to \nmake bilateral linkage possible.\n\nBasic Principles on Establishing an RSI \n\nThrough the discussions on RSI options, the CSIF identified the following basic principles in \nplanning and designing the RSI for the region. \n\nPrinciple 1: \n\n Domesticity and cost efficiency: Maximize utilization of existing cash and \nbond settlement infrastructure. \n\nPrinciple 2:   Safety:  As \n\nrecommended \n\nfor  financial  market \ninfrastructures,\u201d  cash  settlement  should  use  central  bank  money  where \npractical and available.\n\nin  the  \u201cPrinciples \n\nPrinciple 3: \n\n Flexibility: Allow newcomers to join when market is reasonably developed \nand ready.\n\nPrinciple 4:   Accessibility:  Structure  that  small-  and  medium-sized  local  financial \ninstitutions can benefit (not just for major and global players). \n\nPrinciple 5: \n\n Gradual  integration:  Start  from  bilateral \ncentralized integration as long-term goal.\n\nlinks.  Explore  possibility  of \n\nPrinciple 6:   Consistency  and  collaboration  with  other  initiatives:  Explore  greater \nbenefit by maintaining consistency and collaboration with other initiatives of \nthe region. \n\nPrinciple 7: \n\n Standardization: Standardize market practices and technical aspects among \nmembers as much as possible to minimize costs.\n\nPrinciple 8:   Harmonization of rules and regulations: Harmonize rules and regulations \nas much as practical which hinder cross-border transaction. Regulations that \nrequire holistic policy considerations  such as capital  control, taxation, etc., \nare taken as given.\n\nThe CSIF considered that the CSD-RTGS Linkage model best fits with and could follow the \nbasic principles identified above. A comparison of the RSI options with the basic principles \nis summarized in Attachment 3.\n\n\f10\u2003Basic Principles on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and Next Steps Forward\n\nThe majority of the CSIF member countries are involved in the ASEAN WC-PSS, which aims \nto facilitate more efficient access to issuers and investors to tap the ASEAN capital markets \nfor equities and government and corporate bonds. Therefore, cooperation and coordinating \nefforts  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  initiatives  under  the  CSIF  are  aligned  with  other \ninitiatives in the region, including those of the WC-PSS. \n\n\fRecommendations and Next Steps\n\nRecommendations\n\nBased on the discussions, the CSIF recommends the following.\n\n(i) \n\n Each economy in the region is encouraged to establish cross-border bilateral linkages \nof  national  CSDs  and  RTGS  systems  when  respective  markets  are  sufficiently \ndeveloped,  infrastructures  are  ready  to  link  each  other  and  the  linkages  will  bring \nsignificant benefits to the home economies.\n\n(ii)   In  establishing  the  bilateral  linkages,  each  economy  in  the  region  should  apply  the \n\nBasic Principles on establishing RSI.\n\n(iii)   Through, and in parallel with, works to establish the bilateral linkages, each economy \nshould  continue  efforts  to  facilitate  standardization,  harmonization  of  rule  and \nregulation as appropriate which would increase transactions and cost-efficiency of \ncross-border bonds transactions in the region.\n\n(iv)  As  long-term  perspective,  practical  integrated  solution  should  also  be  considered \nassuming  that  the  number  of  bilateral  linkages  would  increase  to  the  extent  that \nintegrated model is viable. \n\nNext Steps\n\nIn order to facilitate relevant works in accordance with the recommendations above, the CSIF \nshall develop implementation plan. As way forward, the CSIF should conduct comprehensive \nanalysis  to  identify  necessary  requirements  of  the  gateway  and  of  others  for  CSD-RTGS \nlinkages. In doing this, desktop study of bilateral CSD-RTGS linkage covering legal, technical \nand  operational  aspect  by  volunteering  members  could  be  efficient  to  check  viability  and \nfeasibility of the model. A basic guideline for CSD-RTGS linkages could be developed based \non identified requirements by the comprehensive analysis.\n\nAlong  with  the  study  above,  the  CSIF  shall  develop    implementation  roadmap  of  CSD-\nRTGS linkages as short-term and medium-term goal (by 2018) and integrated solution in \naccordance with the eight principles as long-term goal (around 2020).\n\nIn order to implement the above cross-border settlement facility, standardization of message \nflows and items is essential. The ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF), Subforum 2 (SF2) \nhas  been  conducting  extensive  study  on  standardization  of  bond  transaction  to  facilitate \ncross-border STP in the region. Although target area to be standardized between the ABMF \nSF2 and the CSIF is different, close communication and collaboration among the two forums \nis desirable to achieve wider-range of standardization and further efficiency. \n\n11\n\n\fAttachments\n\nAttachment 1:\u2002Members, Observers, and Secretariat\n\nCountry\n\nInstitution\n\nName\n\nEddie Mardini\n\nNurhuaida Fakhriah Damit\n\nBRU\n\nAutoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam \n\nNoor Aznah Nayan\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China\n\nPRC\n\nChina Central Depository and Clearing \n\nHKG\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nINO\n\nBank Indonesia\n\nBank of Japan\n\nJPN\n\nJapan Securities Depository Center\n\nMinistry of Finance, Japan\n\nBank of Korea\n\nKOR\n\nKorea Securities Depository\n\nLim Shaw Fhen\n\nKasiani Kassim\n\nCheng Shigang \n\nWeihua Zhang\n\nRuixing Fan\n\nJun Cao\n\nShu-pui Li\n\nFlora Wong\n\nAnton Daryono\n\nJultarda Hutagalung\n\nHimawan Kusprianto\n\nJunichi Suzuki\n\nHiroyuki Nishizawa\n\nMegumi Takei\n\nTakahito Yamada\n\nHiroshi Ikegami\n\nYuji Sato\n\nKazuo Kobayashi\n\nJisung Ko\n\nLee Byoung Mok\n\nJong-hyung Lee\n\nByong Kil Choi\n\nYoung Ho Park\n\nEuin Jin Kwon\n\nThe Whan Lim\n\nSo Yeon Kim\n\nYou Na Im\n\nByoungkook Kim\n\nYe Ji Shin\n\n12\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\fAttachments\u200313\n\nCountry\n\nInstitution\n\nName\n\nKOR\n\nMinistry of Strategy and Finance, Korea\n\nLAO\n\nMinistry of Finance, Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic\n\nMAL\n\nBank Negara Malaysia\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\n\nPHI\n\nPhilippines Dealing System Holdings\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nSIN\n\nMonetary Authority of Singapore\n\nBank of Thailand\n\nTHA\n\nThailand Securities Depository \n\nMinistry of Finance, Thailand (Public Debt \nManagement Office)\n\nVIE\n\nMinistry of Finance of Viet Nam\n\nJi-Young Choi\n\nSangYong Lee\n\nHohyun Jang\n\nBoualith Khounsy\n\nChanpasith Sengphaathith\n\nAden Nadia Jabbari\n\nBella S.

Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.6 billion people who live on less than\n$2 a day, with 733 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments \nfor helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees,\ngrants, and technical assistance.\n\nBASIC PRINCIPLES ON \nESTABLISHING A REGIONAL \nSETTLEMENT INTERMEDIARY \nAND NEXT STEPS FORWARD\nCROSS-BORDER SETTLEMENT \nINFRASTRUCTURE FORUM\n\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City \n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["BASIC PRINCIPLES ON  \nESTABLISHING A REGIONAL  \nSETTLEMENT INTERMEDIARY  \nAND NEXT STEPS FORWARD\n", "CROSS-BORDER SETTLEMENT  \nINFRASTRUCTURE FORUM\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "\u00a9 2014 Asian Development Bank\n", "All rights reserved.
