Further, the \nexperience of the newly industrialized economies suggests that human capital investments will be a vital \ningredient  of  the  transition  from  middle  income  to  high  income.  Those  investments  can  also  affect \nequity and public finances. In this paper, we use data from the National Transfer Accounts to empirically \nanalyze the effect of human capital investment in Asian countries on economic growth, inequality, and \nfiscal balance. Our empirical evidence suggests that human capital investments have a positive effect \non  labor  productivity  and,  hence,  output.  The  positive  effect  is  stronger  for  poorer  households  and, \nhence, beneficial for equity. We also find that such investments can generate sufficient tax revenues to \nimprove the fiscal balance. Overall, our evidence points to a positive effect of human capital on growth, \nequity, and fiscal balance in Asia. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: Asia, fiscal balance, growth, human capital, inequality \n \nJEL codes: J24, H52, I24, I25 \n \n \n\n\f\u00a0\n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nOne  major  consequence  of  Asia\u2019s  sustained  rapid  growth  is  the  region\u2019s  transformation  from  a  low-\nincome region to a middle-income region in a short span of time. As recently as 1992, more than 90% of \nAsia\u2019s population lived in low-income countries, but by 2014, more than 95% of its population lived in \nmiddle-income countries (ADB 2017). The challenge now facing the region is to keep up the growth \nmomentum,  and  make  the  next  transition  from  middle  income  to  high  income.  By  and  large,  the \ntransition from middle to high income is challenging. This explains why many middle-income countries \nin Latin America and in Asia remain in middle income for a long time, a tendency widely known as the \nmiddle-income trap. \n\n \nOne  group  of  middle-income  economies  that  successfully  graduated  to  high  income  are  the \nnewly industrialized economies: Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. \nExceptionally rapid growth enabled the newly industrialized economies to transition from middle to high \nincome in a relatively short period, less than 25 years in the Republic of Korea\u2019s case. A large number of \nempirical  and  theoretical  analyses  of  possible  drivers  of  this  phenomenon  almost  invariably  finds  a \ncentral role of human capital on economic growth (Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992; Barro 2001; and \nAghion and Howitt 2009). Further, these studies indicate that government policies played an important \nrole in accumulating human capital and allocating human capital to productive uses.  Recent studies find \nthat knowledge capital can also help explain the rapid growth of the East Asian economies (Hanushek \nand Woessmann 2016). \n\n \nThe rapid aging of Asia\u2019s population further strengthens the case for human capital accumulation, \nand  spotlights  its  potential  contribution  to  economic  growth.  Intuitively,  more  productive  workers  can \noffset the adverse effect of fewer workers. The share of the elderly population is rising across the entire \nregion, although the current status of population aging still varies a lot across the region. For instance, India \nand  the  Philippines  are  still  relatively  young,  while  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Thailand  have \nsignificantly  older  populations.  The  Republic  of  Korea  and  Singapore  are  at  an  advanced  stage  of \ndemographic  transition.  Despite  such  heterogeneity,  there  is  a  clear  regionwide  trend  toward  older \npopulations  and,  even  in  younger  Asian  countries,  the  demographic  dividends  associated  with  large \nworking-age  populations  are  set  to  dwindle  in  the  foreseeable  future  (ADB  2011).  The  pace  of \ndemographic transition is taking place at a very rapid rate in some Asian economies, especially in East Asia. \nBetween 2000 and 2050, the old-age dependency ratio will increase by a factor of six in the Republic of \nKorea, while it will quadruple in the People\u2019s Republic of China. In the absence of significant human capital \ninvestments, many aging middle-income Asian economies may see their growth fall sharply.  \n\n \nA  shift  in  population  age  structure  can  have  two  effects  on  growth.  The  first  demographic \ndividend is a very direct effect on income and consumption due to a decline in fertility. Over the second \nhalf  of  the  20th  century  and  early  21st  century,  a  secular  fertility  decline  has  caused  radical  and \nimportant changes in the population age distribution in Asia and the rest of the world. In the medium \nterm,  countries  in  the  early  stage  of  demographic  transition  have  gained  from  a  rising  share  of  the \nworking-age  population  relative  to  the  young  and  elderly  (Bloom  and  Williamson  1998,  Kelley  and \nSchmidt 2001, Mason 2001, and Mason and Lee 2007). The same demographic forces have improved \nfiscal health in developing Asia in the short run (Lee, Kim, and Park 2016).1 The second demographic \ndividend stems from a scaling up of human capital investment and is associated with three main effects: \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1 \n\nIn the longer term, however, populations being increasingly concentrated at older ages will put significant strain on the fiscal \nsystem in Asia, not only in countries with especially generous public support systems for the elderly, but also in countries \nthat rely heavily on labor income taxes to finance public consumption. \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 529 \n\nhigher consumption growth, greater physical capital  per worker, and better and more human capital. \nMason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) estimate these effects and find that human capital is a highly significant \nchannel of this demographic dividend.  Both Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) and Lee and Mason (2010) \nfind that fertility decline that is accompanied by an increase in human capital investment in children can \nsubstantially boost economic growth. \n\n \nIn addition to its effect on economic growth, human capital investment can influence income \ninequality  and  fiscal  balance.  While  sustained  rapid  growth  has  enabled  developing  Asia  to  reduce \npoverty  on  an  unprecedented  scale,  the  region  faces  the  challenge  of  rising  inequality  (ADB  2012). \nIndeed, the widening income gap between the rich and the poor is a global problem. Lack of education \nis a major cause of poverty and a deterrent to upward socioeconomic mobility. By strengthening the \nskills and knowledge of the poor, education can enhance their human capital and earning power, and \nthus  lower  inequality.  The  public  sector  still  provides  much  of  education  in  most  countries.  Public \neducation  contributes  to  a  country\u2019s  stock  of  human  capital  and  enhances  the  productivity  of  its \nworkers.  Higher  labor  productivity  increases  output,  and  hence  taxable  income  and  government \nrevenues.  On the other hand, education provision is costly, which explains why education tends to take \nup a substantial share of the government budget. Therefore, an increase in public sector investment in \nhuman capital can either improve or worsen the fiscal balance. \n\n \nThe  central  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  empirically  examine  the  effect  of  human  capital \ninvestment on labor productivity, inequality, and fiscal balance in middle-income Asia. To do so, we use \ndata from the National Transfer Accounts (NTA). \n\n \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the empirical framework, i.e., \ndata and model, used for our analysis. Section III reports and discusses a simple case study that simulates \nthe impact of human capital spending on different population groups of the Philippines. The case study \nallows us to analyze the distributional effects of targeted human capital spending. Section IV reports the \nsimulation results of applying our model to 12 Asian countries. The results suggest that human capital \ninvestment not only increases labor productivity and hence output, but also reduces income inequality \nand improves the government\u2019s fiscal balance. Section V concludes the paper. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nEMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK \n\nData \n\n \nIn this section, we describe the data and model we use for our empirical analysis. \n \nA. \n \nOur  major  source  of  data  is  the  NTA  (www.ntaccounts.org),  an  accounting  framework  which \ndocuments economic flows across populations of different ages in a manner consistent with the United \nNations System of National Accounts (UN DESA 2013). NTA has been estimated for more than 60 \ncountries  by  an  international  network  of  academics,  researchers,  and  government  statisticians \ncollaborating under the NTA project. The economic lifecycles are estimated from household surveys \nand government administrative data, and are scaled to match aggregate controls compiled based on the \nUnited Nations System of National Accounts. NTA provides a detailed measure on how much people \nconsume and produce at different ages, and how the gap in their consumption and production is funded \nthrough other sources, namely transfers and asset-based reallocations. Except for labor income, NTA \ndistinguish between flows mediated by the private and public sectors. Some early cross-country studies \nbased on NTA include Lee, Lee, and Mason (2008); Mason et al. (2009); and Lee and Mason (2011). \n\n\fHuman Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   3 \n\nNTA estimates in current local currency units were  converted  to constant  2011 United Sates dollars \nusing purchasing power parity factors (World Bank 2016). \n\n \nData on human capital spending and labor income are based on NTA lifecycle estimates in 12 \nAsian  economies;  namely,  Bangladesh,  Cambodia,  India,  Indonesia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia, \nMongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. These economies range from \nlow  income  to  high  income,  but  are  predominantly  middle  income.    We  measure  human  capital \ninvestments based on NTA estimates of public and private expenditures on education and health at \neach age. The NTA measure of human capital expenditure might contain some useful information about \nquality of human capital, an important dimension of human capital. It also allows us to consider both \npublic and private human capital investment separately.  \n\n \nFollowing Lee and Mason (2010), we include education expenditure for ages 0\u201326. We only \nconsider  health  care  expenditure  for  ages  0\u201317  to  exclude  health  spending  related  to  reproductive \nhealth. It is important to note that NTA estimate of human capital spending only captures goods and \nservices available from the market, and does not include the opportunity cost of time of students or the \nvalue of services provided by parents and other family members who contribute to human capital. \n\n \nAnalyzing fiscal effects necessarily requires estimates of tax profiles. NTA distinguishes public \ntransfer flows to and from households by purpose, e.g., education, health, and pension, and by source, \ne.g.,  labor  income  tax,  consumption  tax,  and  social  security  contributions.  These  estimates  are  not \navailable for some Asian countries in our sample. As an alternative, we use country-specific personal \nincome tax rates and NTA labor income age profile estimates to construct country tax profiles. \n\n \nModel \n\n \n\nB. \n \nThe analysis builds on recent research by Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) simulating the impact of the \ndemographic transition on the aggregate economy through greater investments on children, specifically \non  their  human  capital.  We  focus  on  the  impact  of  expanding  human  capital  investments  on  both \nproductivity  and  inequality  in  developing  Asia  countries.  We  also  look  into  how  various  targeted \ngovernment interventions to raise human capital may affect fiscal sustainability. \n\n \nFollowing Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016), we specify that the aggregate economy is governed by \n\na production function similar to that proposed by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) \n\n(cid:1851)(cid:3047) (cid:3404) (cid:1837)(cid:3047)\n\n(cid:3080)(cid:1834)(cid:3047)\n\n(cid:3081)(cid:1838)(cid:3047)\n\n(cid:873)(cid:2879)(cid:3080)(cid:2879)(cid:3081) \n\n \nwhere (cid:1851)(cid:3047) is aggregate output at period (cid:1872), (cid:1837) is capital, (cid:1834) is human capital, and (cid:1838) is raw labor.

Instead, it must be \ncombined  with  the  effective  labor  supply.  The  returns  to  investing  on  the  human  capital  of  children \ntherefore are not realized until later when children mature, join the labor force, and begin working. \n\n \nWe  further  assume  that  the  production  of  human  capital  is  governed  by  the  following \n\nproduction function: \n \n\n(cid:3082)\n(cid:1860)(cid:3047)(cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:2015)(cid:3036)(cid:3427)(cid:2038)(cid:3034)(cid:1864)(cid:3034)(cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667) (cid:3397) (cid:2038)(cid:3033)(cid:1864)(cid:3033)(cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667)(cid:1857) (cid:3053)(cid:3431)\n\n(cid:3397) (cid:4666)(cid:873) (cid:3398) (cid:2012)(cid:4667)(cid:1860)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:873)(cid:4666)(cid:1876) (cid:3398) (cid:873)(cid:4667) \n\n(6)\n\n \nwhere (cid:1864)(cid:3034)(cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667)  and (cid:1864)(cid:3033)(cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667) are human capital investments by government and households, respectively, and \n(cid:2011) \u2208 (cid:4666)(cid:872),(cid:873)(cid:4667) is the output elasticity. The human capital stock law of motion in this equation indicates that a \nunit investment in human capital does not necessarily translate to a unit of human capital.

To  simplify  our  estimation,  we  limit  the \nparameter space we are estimating by setting the production elasticities (cid:2009) and (cid:2010) to be both equal to \none-third, based on earlier estimates by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992), and following Mason, Lee, \nand Jiang (2016). For our baseline estimates, we follow the assumption of Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) \nthat  public  and  private  human  capital  spending  are  equally  effective  by  setting  (cid:2038)(cid:3034) (cid:3404) (cid:2038)(cid:3033) (cid:3404) (cid:873),  and  we \nshow  how  the  results  vary  when  we  increase  the  efficiency  of  publicly  provided  human  capital \ninvestment. Finally, we assume (cid:2012) to be 0.02.  \n\n \nEstimation of the rest of the parameters are done in two stages. First, we estimate (cid:2011) and (cid:2015) using \nNTA estimates of labor income, and public and private human capital spending per capita age profiles \nfor 58 economies estimated for a recent year. For  each economy in our sample, we simulate 10,000 \nindividuals by drawing a series of random shocks for equation (6) from a standard normal distribution, \nwhich are held constant throughout the estimation. The random shocks are then used to calculate the \nmoments implied in equations (7), (8), (9), and (10). These simulated moments are stacked to form the \nvector (cid:1842)(cid:3014)(cid:4666)(cid:2011), (cid:2015)(cid:4667). Next, we calculate the analogues of (cid:1842)(cid:3014)(cid:4666)(cid:2011), (cid:2015)(cid:4667) from the data in the vector (cid:1842)(cid:3005). Following \nMeghir and Pistaferri (2004), we estimate (cid:4666)(cid:2011), (cid:2015)(cid:4667) by minimizing the objective function: \n\n(cid:1843)(cid:4666)(cid:2011), (cid:2015)(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:4670)(cid:1842)(cid:3014)(cid:4666)(cid:2011), (cid:2015)(cid:4667) (cid:3398) (cid:1842)(cid:3005)(cid:4671)\u2032(cid:4670)(cid:1842)(cid:3014)(cid:4666)(cid:2011), (cid:2015)(cid:4667) (cid:3398) (cid:1842)(cid:3005)(cid:4671)\n\n(11)\n\n \nNote that (cid:2011) and (cid:2015) may be seen as average estimates for all economies in our sample. Also, the \ndistribution of private human capital investment shocks is the same for all countries. To provide country-\nspecific estimates of (cid:2015) and (cid:2026), we repeat the above procedure for each economy separately, but this time \nholding (cid:2011), in addition to (cid:2012), (cid:2009), (cid:2010),\t(cid:2038)(cid:3034), and (cid:2038)(cid:3033), fixed. We modify the moment conditions in (11) by including \nan additional restriction to allow us to estimate (cid:2026) for each economy. More specifically, we match the \nsimulated labor income Gini coefficient from the model with the observed income Gini coefficient in \neach of the economies in our sample. The estimated parameters are then used to simulate the impact \nof raising human capital spending on labor productivity, income inequality, and fiscal balance.  \n\n \nIn addition to the above model, we also employ a heuristic model using the Philippines as a case \nstudy. The model is based on subnational NTA estimates. Let (cid:1864)(cid:3034)(cid:4666)(cid:1876), (cid:1862)(cid:4667), (cid:1864)(cid:3033)(cid:4666)(cid:1876), (cid:1862)(cid:4667), and (cid:1877)(cid:3039)(cid:4666)(cid:1876), (cid:1862)(cid:4667) be the average \npublic  and  private  human  capital  investments,  and  labor  income,  respectively,  at  each  age  (cid:1876)  for  an \nindividual from some class (cid:1862).  In this na\u00efve simulation, we assume that the labor income age profile is \ndirectly  linked  to  the  schedule  of  human  capital  investments,  such  that  increasing  human  capital \nspending in some class (cid:1863)\tto match the higher spending in some class (cid:1864) leads to class (cid:1863) individuals earning \nlabor income at the same schedule as class (cid:1864) workers. We apply this model using recent subnational \nPhilippines NTA estimates calculated for terciles of household income by residence location (Abrigo et \nal. 2016). This application takes advantage of the increasing availability of subnational NTA estimates, \nand  is  in  line  with  recent  work  which  simulates  the  economic  impact  of  counterfactual  economic \nlifecycle  schedules  on  specific  subpopulations  (Mejia-Guevara  2014;  and  Miller,  Saad,  and  Martinez \n2016). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 529 \n\nIII. \n\nEMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE PHILIPPINES CASE STUDY \n\n \nIn this section, we report and discuss the empirical results from a case study based on subnational data \nfrom the Philippines. Average labor incomes by age, socioeconomic class, and residence are presented \nin Figure 1. The labor income age profiles include earnings and benefits of employees, both those working \nlocally  and  abroad,  and  self-employment  labor  income,  as  well  as  imputed  wages  of  unpaid  family \nworkers. This measure captures age variations in labor force participation, hours worked, productivity, \nand other factors that influence labor supply decisions. Typical of labor income age profiles, it starts from \nzero when young, increases in adulthood, peaks at prime age, and then declines as people retire from the \nlabor market. \n\nFigure 1: Labor Income by Age, Income Group, and Residence: Philippines, 2011\n \n\nUrban: Low income\n\nUrban: Middle income\n\nUrban: High income\n\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n80\n\n40\nAge\n\nRural: Low income\n\nRural: Middle income\n\nRural: High income\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40\nAge\n\n40\n\nAge\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n40\nAge\n\n40\nAge\n\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n80\n\n40\nAge\n\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n80\n\nSelf-employment\n\nEarnings, domestic\n\nEarnings, overseas\n\n \n\nSource: Abrigo et al.

For  instance,  at  peak \nproductive ages, the average labor incomes of workers from rich households are about quadruple those \nfrom low-income households in both rural and urban areas. As workers move up the socioeconomic \nladder, we see labor income to be increasingly compressed toward a narrower age band, reflecting the \nincreasing importance of paid employment in the formal economy in labor income. This trend may also \nreflect the degree of availability of different support systems accessible to populations at either end of \nthe economic lifecycle. For example, schooling keeps the young from working, but poverty may induce \nchildren  to  leave  school  and  work  for  pay.  Insufficient  pension  income  may  induce  the  elderly  to \ncontinue working to support their consumption. \n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n\fHuman Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   7 \n\nAmong poorer households, self-employment labor income is an important source of support, \naccounting for as much as 36% of total labor income among low-income rural households, and as much \nas 18% for low-income urban households. The share of self-employment in total labor income declines \nprogressively with socioeconomic status as more workers enter formal labor markets, including those \noverseas. Among rich households, earnings from overseas employment account for about a third of total \nlabor  income  in  both  rural  and  urban  households.  This  share  declines  as  one  moves  down  the \nsocioeconomic ladder, although it remains substantial. Among low-income rural households, earnings \nfrom temporary international migration accounts for about 29% of all labor income, while the figure is \n23% for low-income urban households. It is noteworthy that the age profile of overseas labor income \npeaks  at  younger  ages  relative  to  the  age  profile  of  local  labor  income,  indicating  the  age-based \nselectivity of international labor migration. \n\n \nThese differences in labor income profiles across subgroups are likely to persist into the future \nwhen we consider current human capital spending patterns. Figure 2 presents the age profile of average \nhuman capital spending by socioeconomic status and residence. Public and private spending on health \nand education are separated to compare and contrast differences across subpopulations. Similar to the \nlabor income age profiles, there is large disparity in human capital spending across groups, with per capita \nspending by age increasing with socioeconomic status, and between rural and urban households.  \n\nFigure 2: Human Capital Spending by Age, Income Group, and Residence: Philippines, 2011\n \n\nUrban: Low income\n\nUrban: Middle income\n\nUrban: High income\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\n\n \n\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nAge\n\nAge\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nAge\n\nRural: Low income\n\nRural: Middle income\n\nRural: High income\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nAge\n\nAge\n\n15\nAge\n\nEducation, Private\n\nEducation, Public\n\nHealth, Private\n\nHealth, Public\n\n \n\nSource: Abrigo et al.

Among low-income \nrural households, for instance, 10% of total consumption is human capital spending. The share ranges \nbetween  6%  and  8%  in  other  socioeconomic  groups.  Among  poorer  households,  public  provision  of \nhealth and education is an important aspect of investment in children, accounting for about 71% of total \nhuman capital spending among low-income urban households, and about 82% among low-income rural \nhouseholds. Among richer households, public provision plays only a secondary role, with about 92% of \nhuman capital spending on children in rich urban households and about 73% in rich rural households \ndone privately. \n \nIn terms of type of spending, education accounts for over half of human capital investments, \nalthough a significant uptick in health spending on infants and children is evident from the human capital \nspending  age  profiles  of  rich  households.  Public  spending  is  largely  skewed  toward  basic  education, \nwhich partly reflects high public school participation rates, and partly reflects the government budget \nallocated to each education level. Private education spending, on the other hand, is more concentrated \nin postsecondary education. \n\n \nThe observed differences in human capital investments across subgroups, to some degree, may \nreflect their demographic conditions. Lee and Mason (2010), for instance, using cross-sectional NTA \ndata of human capital spending and fertility, estimate that a 1% drop in fertility is related to about a 1% \nincrease in lifetime human capital spending. This negative relationship between number of children and \nhuman capital spending can also be observed in the Philippines, not only in the cross-section data but \nalso in time series data.  \n\n \nFigure 3 shows a plot of human capital spending per capita summed over the relevant ages by \nsocioeconomic status and residence. The synthetic cohort estimates of human capital spending spans \n2 decades. The right-most estimates for each group are for 1991 and the left-most estimates are for 2011. \nWe use the ratio of young dependents ages 0\u201324 to adults ages 25 or higher as proxy for fertility. The \nnumber of young dependents per adult has declined over the years covered. At the same time, human \ncapital spending has increased, although the increase has been more rapid among richer households, \nwho coincidentally have lower young dependency ratio. While the plot does not indicate the direction \nof causation between the number of children and human capital investments, it does reflect a strong \nrelationship between the quantity and the quality of children. \n\nHow can targeted human capital spending interventions alleviate the current disparity in human \ncapital across the population? We experiment with alternative scenarios where average human capital \nspending and labor income age schedules of lower-income households are replaced by spending and \nincome patterns of higher-income households. This allows us to evaluate the possible impact of targeted \ninterventions to raise human capital spending in lower-income households. The profiles are all based on \n2011 Philippines subnational NTA estimates. We assume that the increase in human capital spending is \nborne entirely by the government.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fHuman Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   9 \n\nFigure 3: Human Capital Spending and Number of \nChildren: Philippines, 1991, 1999, and 2011 \n \n\n \n\n \n\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\n \nr\ne\np\ng\nn\nd\nn\ne\np\ns\n \nl\n\ni\n\n \n\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\nn\na\nm\nu\nH\n\n \n\n)\no\ns\ne\np\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nt\n(\n\n \n\n)\n6\n2\n\u2013\n0\ne\ng\na\n \nt\nr\no\nh\no\nc\nc\ni\nt\ne\nh\nt\nn\ny\ns\n(\n\n \n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n1.25\n\n1.50\n\n1.75\n\n2.00\n\n2.25\n\n2.50\n\nPopulation age 0\u201324/Population age 25+\n\nRural: Low income\nRural: High income\nUrban:  Middle income\n\nRural: Middle income\nUrban:  Low income\nUrban:  High income\n\n \n\n \nNote: The right-most estimate for each group refers to the 1991 estimate, the \nmiddle to the 1999 estimate, and the left-most to the 2011 estimate. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on data from Abrigo et al. (2016). \n\n \nWe consider three scenarios. In the first scenario, average human capital spending and labor \nincome age schedules of rural households are replaced by those of urban households. In the second \nscenario,  the  age  profiles  of  lower-income  populations  are  replaced  by  the  age  profiles  of  the  next \nhigher-income class in our analysis, i.e., low-income profiles are replaced by middle-income profiles, and \nmiddle-income profiles are replaced by high-income profiles. In the last scenario, age profiles of low-\nincome urban households and of low-income and middle-income rural households are replaced by the \nage profiles of middle-income urban households. We then compare how the resulting distribution of \nhuman  capital  spending  would  change  relative  to  a  baseline  scenario  of  no  change  in  human  capital \nspending. \n\n \nFigure  4  presents  concentration  curves  of  human  capital  spending  under  our  four  different \npolicy scenarios. The concentration curve plots the cumulative distribution of human capital spending, \nrepresenting  benefits,  on  the  vertical  axis,  and  the  cumulative  distribution  of  population  age  26  and \nbelow  sorted  by  socioeconomic  status,  representing  benefit  recipients,  on  the  horizontal  axis.  A \nconcentration curve above the 45-degree diagonal line indicates that the distribution of human capital \nspending is progressive, where spending on poorer households is larger than their share of the recipient \npopulation. A curve below the 45-degree line indicates that richer households receive a higher share of \nthe total human capital spending.  \n\n \n\nPanel A presents the observed benefit incidence of human capital spending in 2011. The plot \nindicates that total human capital spending is regressive. When disaggregated by source, we see that the \ndisparity  is  largely  due  to  private  spending,  which  is  highly  skewed  toward  richer  households.

(2016). \n\n \nIn panels B, C, and D, we show the corresponding change in concentration curves under our \nspecified  alternative  scenarios.  The  concentration  curves  for  private  spending  do  not  change  across \nscenarios since we assume that the additional spending is borne by the government. Overall, the plots \nindicate  that  targeted  spending  alleviates  inequalities  in  human  capital  investments  as  a  result  of \npropoor public human capital spending. However, there are some qualitative differences. Results from \nour simulation show that the urban-to-rural (panel B) and the low-to-middle/middle-to-high (panel C) \ntargeted human capital spending scenarios are likely to benefit middle-income households more than \nlow-income households. Setting a minimum level of human capital spending age schedule (panel D), \nwhich here we peg at the spending level of middle-income urban households, will benefit the poorest \nthe most. \n\n \nThe concentration curves in Figure 4 are summarized in Table 1 by calculating the implied Suits \nindex. The index ranges from \u20131 to 1, where a value of \u20131 indicates that all human capital spending goes \n\n\fHuman Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   11 \n\nto the poorest person in the economy, while a value of 1 signifies that all spending goes to the richest \nperson. At baseline, combined public and private human capital spending\u2019s Suits index is at 0.19. This is \ncomparable with the 0.24 estimated by Mesa (2007) using years of schooling in 2000. \n\n \nThe estimated Suits index confirms our earlier observation, based on concentration curves, that \ntargeted spending interventions reduce human capital inequality. Depending on the scenario, the Suits \nindex for total human capital spending drops by 2\u20135  percentage points. This is due to public human \ncapital spending becoming more progressive, with the Suits index ranging from \u20130.01 to \u20130.05 from a \nbaseline  value  of  0.01.  Because  of  the  higher  spending  among  lower-income  households,  average \nlifetime human capital spending per person is projected to increase between 9% and 58% of the baseline \nlevel, with the government funding 45%\u201362% of the total spending from the baseline 40%. \n\n \nTable 1: Human Capital Spending and Inequality: Observed and Simulated \n \n\nSimulation Scenario \nBaseline (status quo) \nRural\u2013urban scenario \nLow\u2013middle/Middle\u2013high scenario \nUrban\u2013middle scenario \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nHuman Capital Spending\nPublic\n(% of total) \n40.0\n44.9\n62.1\n53.3\n\nCombined\n(% of baseline) \n100.0\n108.9\n158.4\n128.3\n\nSuits Coefficient\n\nCombined \nSpending \n0.19 \n0.17 \n0.15 \n0.14 \n\nPublic \nSpending \n0.01\n\u20130.01\n\u20130.05\n\u20130.05\n\nThe increased human capital spending is projected to boost labor income by about 30%\u201350% \nof the baseline value.

Figure 5 plots \nlifetime  public  and  private  human  capital  investments  in  Asia  and  in  other  countries  where  NTA \nestimates  are  available.  For  cross-country  comparability,  we  normalized  the  values  relative  to  the \naverage  labor  income  of  persons  ages  30\u201349.  This  allows  us  to  control  cross-country  differences, \nincluding  labor  costs,  which  are  important  in  the production  of  education  services  (Mason,  Lee,  and \nJiang 2016). Estimates below (above) the 45-degree line indicate greater share of the private (public) \nsector in financing human capital spending.  Estimates that are closer to (more distant from) the origin \nsignify smaller (greater) human capital spending in total. \n\nFigure 5: Public versus Private Human Capital Spending \nin Developing Asia \n \n\n6.0\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\n \n\ni\n\ng\nn\nd\nn\ne\np\ns\n \nl\n\n \n\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\nn\na\nm\nu\nh\nc\n\n \n\ni\nl\n\nb\nu\nP\n\ne\nm\no\nc\nn\n\ni\n \nr\no\nb\na\n\nl\n \n\n \n\ne\ng\na\nr\ne\nv\na\n \nf\no\nn\no\ni\nt\nr\no\np\no\nr\np\n(\n\n)\n9\n4\n\u2013\n0\n3\ne\ng\na\n \nf\no\n\n \n\nTHA\n\nKOR\n\nMAL\n\nTIM\n\nIND\n\nNEP\n\nBAN\n\n0\n\n0 \n\nINO\n\nVIE\n\n2.0 \n\nPHI\n\nCAM\n\nMON\n\nPrivate human capital spending\n(proportion of average labor income of age 30\u201349)\n\n4.0 \n\n6.0\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nRest of the world\n\n \n\n \nBAN = Bangladesh, CAM = Cambodia, IND = India, INO = Indonesia,  \nKOR = Republic of Korea, MAL = Malaysia, MON = Mongolia, NEP = Nepal,  \nPHI = Philippines, THA = Thailand, TIM = Timor-Leste, VIE = Viet Nam. \nNotes: Lifetime public and private human capital spending is based on a synthetic \ncohort measure of health and education spending based on National Transfer \nAccounts data for a recent year.

Thailand, for instance, invests on average about 5 years of prime-age labor income on \nhuman capital for each person. In Bangladesh, on the other hand, the average lifetime human capital \nspending per person is only 1.4 years of prime-age labor income. Viet Nam and Timor-Leste spend about \n2.3 years of labor income on human capital per person, but Viet Nam relies largely on private spending \nrather than on government. The variations in human capital spending are, to some extent, related to \neach country\u2019s level of economic development. \n\n \n \n\n\fHuman Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   13 \n\nFigure 6 plots each country\u2019s average lifetime human capital spending against its per capita gross \nnational  income.  Two  observations  are  self-evident.  First,  higher-income  countries  invest  more  on \nhuman capital per person (panel A). That investing in human capital is important in promoting economic \ngrowth has been well emphasized in the literature. While the majority of Asian countries in our sample \nare investing around the average level of their income group, if not more, there are some countries like \nMalaysia, the Philippines, and Timor-Leste that invest substantially below the average.  \n\nFigure 6: Human Capital Spending and Gross National Income per Capita \n \n\n \n\n(a) Total human capital spending \n\n(b) Public share of human capital spending \n\nKOR\n\nTHA\n\nMAL\n\n6.0\n\n4.0\n\nn\no\ns\nr\ne\np\n \nr\ne\np\ng\nn\nd\nn\ne\np\ns\n \nl\n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\nn\na\nm\nu\nh\ne\ng\na\nr\ne\nv\nA\n\n \n\n \n\ne\nm\no\nc\nn\n\ni\n \nr\no\nb\na\n\nl\n \n\n \n\ne\ng\na\nr\ne\nv\na\n \nf\no\nn\no\ni\nt\nr\no\np\no\nr\np\n(\n\n)\n9\n4\n\u2013\n0\n3\n\n \n \n\ne\ng\na\n \nf\no\n\nINO\n\nMON\n\nVIE\n\nCAM\n\n2.0\n\nIND\n\nTIM\n\nPHI\n\nBAN\n\nNEP\n\n0\n\nn\no\ns\nr\ne\np\n \nr\ne\np\ng\nn\nd\nn\ne\np\ns\n \nl\n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\nn\na\nm\nu\nh\nc\n\n \n\ni\nl\n\nb\nu\nP\n\n)\nn\no\ns\nr\ne\np\n \nr\ne\np\n\n \nl\n\n \n\na\nt\no\nt\n \nf\no\nn\no\ni\nt\nr\no\np\no\nr\np\n(\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nTIM\n\nTHA\n\nMAL\n\nINO\n\nPHI\n\nMON\n\nIND\n\nNEP\n\nCAM\n\nVIE\n\nBAN\n\nKOR\n\n0\n\n10,000\n\n20,000\n\n30,000\n\n40,000\n\n50,000\n\n0 \n\n10,000 \n\n20,000  30,000  40,000  50,000\n\nPer capita GNI (2011 PPP$)\n\nPer capita GNI (2011 PPP$)\n\nDeveloping Asia\n \n\nRest of the world\n\n \n\nBAN = Bangladesh, CAM = Cambodia, GNI = gross national income, IND = India, INO = Indonesia, KOR = Republic of Korea,  \nMAL = Malaysia, MON = Mongolia, NEP = Nepal, PHI = Philippines, PPP = purchasing power parity, THA = Thailand, TIM = Timor-Leste, \nVIE = Viet Nam.  \nNotes: Lifetime public and private human capital spending is based on a synthetic cohort measure of health and education spending \nbased on National Transfer Accounts data.

While there is wide variation in the government\u2019s share in human capital spending \namong developing countries, there is a clear upward trend as per capita gross national income increases. \nThis shift toward an increasing role by governments in financing human capital investments has also \nbeen  observed  recently  in  health  spending  (Fan  and  Savedoff  2014),  and  much  earlier  in  financing \nconsumption in general (Peacock and Wiseman 1961).  \n\n \nWhat could be the potential impacts of increasing human capital spending?

Lower-income countries are \nlikely  to  benefit  more  from  increased  human  capital  spending.  Labor  productivity  in  lower-income \ncountries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Nepal is projected to increase by 2%\u20133.5% as a result of a 20% \nexpansion  of  human  capital  spending  per  person.  In  more  developed  countries,  like  Malaysia  and \nThailand, the projected impact is more modest. It is quite interesting that, among countries with similar \neconomic levels, for instance, Bangladesh and India, the projected impact of human capital spending on \nlabor  productivity  can  differ  quite  substantially,  reflecting  their  different  population  age  profiles  of \nproductivity. The simulated impact on productivity growth in the Republic of Korea and Nepal is about \nthe same despite the huge disparity in income level, suggesting that human capital spending may still \nbenefit higher-income countries despite the general reduction in impact as per capita income rises. \n\n \nIn addition, human capital spending has a significant impact on reducing inequality. Again, the \nimpact is greatest among lower-income countries than in more-developed economies. In Bangladesh, \nCambodia, Nepal, and Viet Nam, for instance, increased human capital spending is projected to bring \ndown income Gini coefficients by 3%\u20135% relative to baseline values. In more developed Thailand and \nMalaysia, the impact is more modest, ranging from 1% to 2% drop. \n\n \nThe welfare impact of human capital spending may be traced to its greater impact on poorer \nhouseholds, especially in lower-income countries (Table 3). In Bangladesh and Cambodia, for instance, \nlabor productivity among the poorest income quintile households is projected to increase by about 7%\u2013\n8%. The impact on higher-income households is also substantial, but smaller. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\fHuman Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   15 \n\nTable 3: Simulated Impact of Human Capital Spending on Productivity Growth and Inequality \n \n\nCountry \nBangladesh \nCambodia \nIndia \nIndonesia \nRepublic of Korea \nMalaysia \nMongolia \nNepal \nPhilippines \nThailand \nTimor-Leste \nViet Nam \n\nQ = Income quintile. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\n \n\n \n\n% Change in Inequality \nHuman \nCapital \n\u20136.7 \n\u20137.2 \n\u20133.7 \n\u20132.3 \n\u20135.1 \n\u20130.3 \n\u20135.8 \n\u20135.1 \n\u20134.3 \n\u20132.9 \n\u20134.5 \n\u20134.1 \n\nLabor \nIncome \n\u20134.1\n\u20134.5\n\u20132.1\n\u20131.3\n\u20133.1\n\u20130.2\n\u20133.5\n\u20133.1\n\u20132.6\n\u20131.7\n\u20132.4\n\u20132.5\n\nQ1 \n(poorest) \n7.5\n7.4\n3.4\n2.3\n4.9\n0.3\n5.7\n4.7\n4.7\n2.6\n3.5\n4.7\n\n \n\nProductivity Growth Rate (%) \nby Income Quintile \n\nQ2 \n5.7\n6.1\n3.3\n2.2\n4.3\n0.3\n4.9\n4.3\n4.2\n2.6\n3.5\n3.9\n\nQ3 \n4.0\n4.6\n2.8\n1.9\n3.5\n0.3\n3.9\n3.5\n3.3\n2.5\n3.3\n2.9\n\nQ5 \n(richest) \n0.6 \n0.8 \n0.3 \n0.2 \n0.5 \n0.0 \n0.6 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n0.3 \n0.6 \n0.3 \n\nAll \nGroups \n2.7\n3.1\n1.6\n1.0\n2.1\n0.1\n2.4\n2.2\n1.9\n1.3\n2.0\n1.7\n\nQ4 \n2.4 \n2.8 \n2.0 \n1.3 \n2.3 \n0.2 \n2.5 \n2.4 \n2.1 \n1.9 \n2.8 \n1.7 \n\nThe increase in worker productivity is expected to benefit the government as well. The fiscal \neffect  of  greater  human  capital  spending  depends  on  each  country\u2019s  tax  structure  inasmuch  as  it \ndepends  on  the  government\u2019s  role  in  the  increase  in  human  capital  spending  and  the  effect  of  such \nspending  on  labor  productivity.  Personal  income  tax  per  capita  in  Cambodia  and  Timor-Leste,  for \ninstance, is projected to increase by at least 3% (Table 4, panel A). In other countries, the projected \nimpact on government revenues are economically insignificant despite large gains in labor productivity.  \n\n \nThere  are  many  different  ways  governments  can  intervene  to  increase  human  capital  spending \nbesides  a  universal  increase  in  spending.  For  instance,  governments  may  target  human  capital  spending \nexpansion only on vulnerable groups, while keeping current levels of spending on other groups. An alternative \nstrategy could be to increase the efficiency of public spending without increasing the level of spending. These \nstrategies are not mutually exclusive, and may be combined to create more targeted strategies. \n\n \nFor  further  analysis,  we  consider  three  types  of  targeted  strategies.  In  the  first  strategy,  we \nassume  governments  increase  its  spending  per  person  by  20%  of  the  average  total  human  capital \nspending  by  age.  We  assume  that  there  is  no  change  in  the  government\u2019s  efficiency  in  this  scenario \n(strategy 1). In the second strategy, we assume a 20% increase in public efficiency in translating inputs \nto  human  capital,  but  we  hold  public  spending  at  its  baseline  values  (strategy  2).  Finally,  in  the  last \nscenario, we combine the two strategies, so there is a 20% increase in both human capital spending and \nhuman capital production efficiency (strategy 3). We then combine these three scenarios with three \ndifferent government targeting schemes; namely, a universal program where every household benefits \nfrom  public  human  capital  interventions,  and  targeted  programs  that  are  available  only  to  either  the \npoorest 40% or poorest 60% of households. Table 4 summarizes the projected effects of different public \nhuman capital interventions on Asia. \n\n \nIn all of the strategies considered, government revenues are projected to increase, with labor \nincome per capita growing by as much as 3%\u20135% in some scenarios in some countries. Increasing both \npublic efficiency and public provision of human capital spending seems to result in greater increase in \ntax  collection  per  capita,  relative  to  the  combined  impact  of  separately  pursuing  each  intervention. \nThere is a modest negative change, if at all, in effective tax rates, indicating that household labor income \nwill grow faster than the amount collected from them in taxes by the government.  \n\n\f16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 529 \n\nTable 4: Simulated Fiscal Impacts of Universal and Targeted Human Capital Interventions \n \n\nCountry \n\nChange in Effective Tax Tate \n(percentage point difference) \nLower 40 \n\nUniversal \n\nLower 60 \n\n  \n\n  \n\nGrowth in Personal (Labor) Income \nTax Per Capita (%) \nLower 40 \n\nUniversal \n\nLower 60 \n\n  \n\n  \n\nChange in Gross Fiscal Rate of Return \n(percentage point difference) \nLower 40 \n\nLower 60 \n\nUniversal \n\nA.

In \ngeneral, strategies that increase production efficiency without increasing inputs have little positive to no \neffect on the overall fiscal rate of return from public human capital spending (panel B). Increasing public \nspending is projected to decrease the overall fiscal rate of return (panels A and C), although the rates \nremain positive in all scenarios. \n\nV. \n\nCONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS \n\n \nIn  this  paper,  we  empirically  examine  the  effect  of  human  capital  spending  on  economic  growth, \nincome  inequality, and fiscal balance in  Asia.  To do  so,  we perform  a  case study  of  the Philippines \nusing subnational data and simulate the impact of human capital spending on growth, inequality, and \nfiscal  balance  in  12  Asian  economies.  Asia\u2019s  rapid  population  aging  and  its  transformation  into  a \nmiddle-income region portend a bigger role for human capital in the region\u2019s future growth. The main \nchannel  through  which  human  capital  affects  growth  and  inequality  is  through  its  effect  on  labor \nincome.  Improved  labor  productivity  boosts  output  and  income  and,  to  the  extent  that  the  poor \nexperience a larger improvement, it also helps to reduce income inequality. Although human capital \nspending  is  costly  for  governments,  its  positive  impact  on  income  expands  the  tax  base  and,  thus, \ngovernment revenues. \n \n\nOur major source of data is the NTA database, which consists of household data that document \neconomic flows across populations of different ages. The results of our empirical analysis indicate that \nhuman  capital  investment  promotes  both  output  growth  and  income  equality  in  Asia,  and  thus \ncontributes  to  more  inclusive  growth  in  the  region.  Poorer  households  experience  a  relatively  larger \nincrease in their labor income, which enables them to narrow the income gap with richer households. \nFurther, the growth impact is larger for poorer Asian countries than for richer countries.  We also find \nthat public investment is more beneficial for equity than private investment.  All in all, our evidence is \nconsistent with the conventional wisdom that public spending on human capital fosters greater equality \nof opportunity. Further, our evidence suggests that the expansion of tax base and fiscal revenues more \nthan offsets the cost of such spending. Overall, our evidence points to a positive effect of human capital \non growth, equity, and fiscal balance in Asia. \n\n \nIt  should  be  pointed  out  that  our  benign  simulated  outcomes  are  not  a  guarantee  of  benign \nactual  outcomes.  The  extent  to  which  human  capital  investment  benefits  economic  growth,  income \ninequality,  and  fiscal  balance  will  depend  in  part  on  how  human  capital  spending  is  transformed  to \nproductive labor. Thus, other government policies and the overall economic environment also come into \nplay. For example, a more flexible labor market will facilitate the transformation of human capital into \nproductive employment. We also looked at three different modes of government intervention on human \ncapital;  namely, a universal increase in human capital spending, a targeted increase in human capital \nspending only for vulnerable groups, and an increase in the efficiency of human capital spending. Again, \nit  should  be  noted  that  these  strategies  are  not  mutually  exclusive,  and  there  is  plenty  of  scope  for \ncombining  them  with  each  other  to  create  better  targeted  strategies.  The  important  issue  of \neffectiveness  of  private  versus  public  human  capital  spending  on  productivity  growth  is  not  much  in \ndetail here, and is left for future studies. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f\u00a0\n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAbrigo, Michael R.

They find that human capital has \na significant effect on labor productivity and, hence, output. The effect is more pronounced for poorer \nhouseholds, pointing to a positive link between human capital and inclusive growth in Asia.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
