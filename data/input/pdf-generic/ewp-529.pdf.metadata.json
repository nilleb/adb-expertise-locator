Further, the \nexperience of the newly industrialized economies suggests that human capital investments will be a vital \ningredient of the transition from middle income to high income. Those investments can also affect \nequity and public finances. In this paper, we use data from the National Transfer Accounts to empirically \nanalyze the effect of human capital investment in Asian countries on economic growth, inequality, and \nfiscal balance. Our empirical evidence suggests that human capital investments have a positive effect \non labor productivity and, hence, output. The positive effect is stronger for poorer households and, \nhence, beneficial for equity. We also find that such investments can generate sufficient tax revenues to \nimprove the fiscal balance. Overall, our evidence points to a positive effect of human capital on growth, \nequity, and fiscal balance in Asia. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: Asia, fiscal balance, growth, human capital, inequality \n \nJEL codes: J24, H52, I24, I25 \n \n ", "\u00a0\nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nOne major consequence of Asia\u2019s sustained rapid growth is the region\u2019s transformation from a low-\nincome region to a middle-income region in a short span of time. As recently as 1992, more than 90% of \nAsia\u2019s population lived in low-income countries, but by 2014, more than 95% of its population lived in \nmiddle-income countries (ADB 2017). The challenge now facing the region is to keep up the growth \nmomentum, and make the next transition from middle income to high income. By and large, the \ntransition from middle to high income is challenging. This explains why many middle-income countries \nin Latin America and in Asia remain in middle income for a long time, a tendency widely known as the \nmiddle-income trap. \n \nOne group of middle-income economies that successfully graduated to high income are the \nnewly industrialized economies: Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. \nExceptionally rapid growth enabled the newly industrialized economies to transition from middle to high \nincome in a relatively short period, less than 25 years in the Republic of Korea\u2019s case. A large number of \nempirical and theoretical analyses of possible drivers of this phenomenon almost invariably finds a \ncentral role of human capital on economic growth (Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992; Barro 2001; and \nAghion and Howitt 2009). Further, these studies indicate that government policies played an important \nrole in accumulating human capital and allocating human capital to productive uses.  Recent studies find \nthat knowledge capital can also help explain the rapid growth of the East Asian economies (Hanushek \nand Woessmann 2016). \n \nThe rapid aging of Asia\u2019s population further strengthens the case for human capital accumulation, \nand spotlights its potential contribution to economic growth. Intuitively, more productive workers can \noffset the adverse effect of fewer workers. The share of the elderly population is rising across the entire \nregion, although the current status of population aging still varies a lot across the region. For instance, India \nand the Philippines are still relatively young, while the People\u2019s Republic of China and Thailand have \nsignificantly older populations. The Republic of Korea and Singapore are at an advanced stage of \ndemographic transition. Despite such heterogeneity, there is a clear regionwide trend toward older \npopulations and, even in younger Asian countries, the demographic dividends associated with large \nworking-age  populations  are  set  to  dwindle  in  the  foreseeable  future  (ADB  2011).  The  pace  of \ndemographic transition is taking place at a very rapid rate in some Asian economies, especially in East Asia. \nBetween 2000 and 2050, the old-age dependency ratio will increase by a factor of six in the Republic of \nKorea, while it will quadruple in the People\u2019s Republic of China. In the absence of significant human capital \ninvestments, many aging middle-income Asian economies may see their growth fall sharply.  \n \nA shift in population age structure can have two effects on growth. The first demographic \ndividend is a very direct effect on income and consumption due to a decline in fertility. Over the second \nhalf of the 20th century and early 21st century, a secular fertility decline has caused radical and \nimportant changes in the population age distribution in Asia and the rest of the world. In the medium \nterm, countries in the early stage of demographic transition have gained from a rising share of the \nworking-age population relative to the young and elderly (Bloom and Williamson 1998, Kelley and \nSchmidt 2001, Mason 2001, and Mason and Lee 2007). The same demographic forces have improved \nfiscal health in developing Asia in the short run (Lee, Kim, and Park 2016).1 The second demographic \ndividend stems from a scaling up of human capital investment and is associated with three main effects: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1  In the longer term, however, populations being increasingly concentrated at older ages will put significant strain on the fiscal \nsystem in Asia, not only in countries with especially generous public support systems for the elderly, but also in countries \nthat rely heavily on labor income taxes to finance public consumption. ", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 529 \nhigher consumption growth, greater physical capital per worker, and better and more human capital. \nMason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) estimate these effects and find that human capital is a highly significant \nchannel of this demographic dividend.  Both Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) and Lee and Mason (2010) \nfind that fertility decline that is accompanied by an increase in human capital investment in children can \nsubstantially boost economic growth. \n \nIn addition to its effect on economic growth, human capital investment can influence income \ninequality and fiscal balance. While sustained rapid growth has enabled developing Asia to reduce \npoverty on an unprecedented scale, the region faces the challenge of rising inequality (ADB 2012). \nIndeed, the widening income gap between the rich and the poor is a global problem. Lack of education \nis a major cause of poverty and a deterrent to upward socioeconomic mobility. By strengthening the \nskills and knowledge of the poor, education can enhance their human capital and earning power, and \nthus lower inequality. The public sector still provides much of education in most countries. Public \neducation contributes to a country\u2019s stock of human capital and enhances the productivity of its \nworkers.  Higher  labor  productivity  increases  output,  and  hence taxable  income  and  government \nrevenues.  On the other hand, education provision is costly, which explains why education tends to take \nup a substantial share of the government budget. Therefore, an increase in public sector investment in \nhuman capital can either improve or worsen the fiscal balance. \n \nThe central objective of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of human capital \ninvestment on labor productivity, inequality, and fiscal balance in middle-income Asia. To do so, we use \ndata from the National Transfer Accounts (NTA). \n \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the empirical framework, i.e., \ndata and model, used for our analysis. Section III reports and discusses a simple case study that simulates \nthe impact of human capital spending on different population groups of the Philippines. The case study \nallows us to analyze the distributional effects of targeted human capital spending. Section IV reports the \nsimulation results of applying our model to 12 Asian countries. The results suggest that human capital \ninvestment not only increases labor productivity and hence output, but also reduces income inequality \nand improves the government\u2019s fiscal balance. Section V concludes the paper. \n \n \nII.  EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK \n \nIn this section, we describe the data and model we use for our empirical analysis. \n \nA.  Data \n \nOur  major  source  of  data  is  the  NTA  (www.ntaccounts.org),  an  accounting  framework  which \ndocuments economic flows across populations of different ages in a manner consistent with the United \nNations System of National Accounts (UN DESA 2013). NTA has been estimated for more than 60 \ncountries  by  an  international  network  of  academics,  researchers,  and  government  statisticians \ncollaborating under the NTA project. The economic lifecycles are estimated from household surveys \nand government administrative data, and are scaled to match aggregate controls compiled based on the \nUnited Nations System of National Accounts. NTA provides a detailed measure on how much people \nconsume and produce at different ages, and how the gap in their consumption and production is funded \nthrough other sources, namely transfers and asset-based reallocations. Except for labor income, NTA \ndistinguish between flows mediated by the private and public sectors. Some early cross-country studies \nbased on NTA include Lee, Lee, and Mason (2008); Mason et al. (2009); and Lee and Mason (2011). ", "Human Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   3 \nNTA estimates in current local currency units were converted to constant 2011 United Sates dollars \nusing purchasing power parity factors (World Bank 2016). \n \nData on human capital spending and labor income are based on NTA lifecycle estimates in 12 \nAsian economies; namely, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, \nMongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. These economies range from \nlow income to high income, but are predominantly middle income.  We measure human capital \ninvestments based on NTA estimates of public and private expenditures on education and health at \neach age. The NTA measure of human capital expenditure might contain some useful information about \nquality of human capital, an important dimension of human capital. It also allows us to consider both \npublic and private human capital investment separately.  \n \nFollowing Lee and Mason (2010), we include education expenditure for ages 0\u201326. We only \nconsider health care expenditure for ages 0\u201317 to exclude health spending related to reproductive \nhealth. It is important to note that NTA estimate of human capital spending only captures goods and \nservices available from the market, and does not include the opportunity cost of time of students or the \nvalue of services provided by parents and other family members who contribute to human capital. \n \nAnalyzing fiscal effects necessarily requires estimates of tax profiles. NTA distinguishes public \ntransfer flows to and from households by purpose, e.g., education, health, and pension, and by source, \ne.g., labor income tax, consumption tax, and social security contributions. These estimates are not \navailable for some Asian countries in our sample. As an alternative, we use country-specific personal \nincome tax rates and NTA labor income age profile estimates to construct country tax profiles. \n \nB.  Model \n \nThe analysis builds on recent research by Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) simulating the impact of the \ndemographic transition on the aggregate economy through greater investments on children, specifically \non their human capital. We focus on the impact of expanding human capital investments on both \nproductivity and inequality in developing Asia countries. We also look into how various targeted \ngovernment interventions to raise human capital may affect fiscal sustainability. \n \nFollowing Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016), we specify that the aggregate economy is governed by \na production function similar to that proposed by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) \n \n(cid:1851) (cid:3404) (cid:1837)(cid:3080)(cid:1834)(cid:3081)(cid:1838)(cid:873)(cid:2879)(cid:3080)(cid:2879)(cid:3081)  (1)\n(cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)\n \nwhere (cid:1851) is aggregate output at period (cid:1872), (cid:1837) is capital, (cid:1834) is human capital, and (cid:1838) is raw labor.

Instead, it must be \ncombined with the effective labor supply. The returns to investing on the human capital of children \ntherefore are not realized until later when children mature, join the labor force, and begin working. \n \nWe  further  assume  that  the  production  of  human  capital  is  governed  by  the  following \nproduction function: \n \n(cid:1860) (cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:2015) (cid:3427)(cid:2038) (cid:1864) (cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667)(cid:3397)(cid:2038) (cid:1864) (cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667)(cid:1857)(cid:3053)(cid:3431)(cid:3082) (cid:3397)(cid:4666)(cid:873)(cid:3398)(cid:2012)(cid:4667)(cid:1860) (cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:3398)(cid:873)(cid:4667)  (6)\n(cid:3047) (cid:3036) (cid:3034) (cid:3034) (cid:3033) (cid:3033) (cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:873)\n \nwhere (cid:1864) (cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667)  and (cid:1864) (cid:4666)(cid:1876)(cid:4667) are human capital investments by government and households, respectively, and \n(cid:3034) (cid:3033)\n(cid:2011) \u2208 (cid:4666)(cid:872),(cid:873)(cid:4667) is the output elasticity. The human capital stock law of motion in this equation indicates that a \nunit investment in human capital does not necessarily translate to a unit of human capital. The factor-\naugmenting technologies (cid:2038) (cid:3410) (cid:872) and (cid:2038) (cid:3410) (cid:872) characterize the efficiency of the public and private \n(cid:3034) (cid:3033)\nsectors, respectively, in transforming inputs of human capital investments into units of human capital. \nFurther, similar to physical capital, we allow human capital stock to depreciate at the rate (cid:2012) per year.

To simplify our estimation, we limit the \nparameter space we are estimating by setting the production elasticities (cid:2009) and (cid:2010) to be both equal to \none-third, based on earlier estimates by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992), and following Mason, Lee, \nand Jiang (2016). For our baseline estimates, we follow the assumption of Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) \nthat public and private human capital spending are equally effective by setting (cid:2038) (cid:3404) (cid:2038) (cid:3404) (cid:873), and we \n(cid:3034) (cid:3033)\nshow  how  the  results  vary  when  we  increase  the  efficiency  of  publicly  provided  human  capital \ninvestment. Finally, we assume (cid:2012) to be 0.02.  \n \nEstimation of the rest of the parameters are done in two stages. First, we estimate (cid:2011) and (cid:2015) using \nNTA estimates of labor income, and public and private human capital spending per capita age profiles \nfor 58 economies estimated for a recent year. For each economy in our sample, we simulate 10,000 \nindividuals by drawing a series of random shocks for equation (6) from a standard normal distribution, \nwhich are held constant throughout the estimation. The random shocks are then used to calculate the \nmoments implied in equations (7), (8), (9), and (10). These simulated moments are stacked to form the \nvector (cid:1842)(cid:3014)(cid:4666)(cid:2011),(cid:2015)(cid:4667). Next, we calculate the analogues of (cid:1842)(cid:3014)(cid:4666)(cid:2011),(cid:2015)(cid:4667) from the data in the vector (cid:1842)(cid:3005). Following \nMeghir and Pistaferri (2004), we estimate (cid:4666)(cid:2011),(cid:2015)(cid:4667) by minimizing the objective function: \n \n(cid:1843)(cid:4666)(cid:2011),(cid:2015)(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:4670)(cid:1842)(cid:3014)(cid:4666)(cid:2011),(cid:2015)(cid:4667)(cid:3398)(cid:1842)(cid:3005)(cid:4671)\u2032(cid:4670)(cid:1842)(cid:3014)(cid:4666)(cid:2011),(cid:2015)(cid:4667)(cid:3398)(cid:1842)(cid:3005)(cid:4671) (11)\n \nNote that (cid:2011) and (cid:2015) may be seen as average estimates for all economies in our sample. Also, the \ndistribution of private human capital investment shocks is the same for all countries. To provide country-\nspecific estimates of (cid:2015) and (cid:2026), we repeat the above procedure for each economy separately, but this time \nholding (cid:2011), in addition to (cid:2012), (cid:2009), (cid:2010),\t(cid:2038) , and (cid:2038) , fixed. We modify the moment conditions in (11) by including \n(cid:3034) (cid:3033)\nan additional restriction to allow us to estimate (cid:2026) for each economy. More specifically, we match the \nsimulated labor income Gini coefficient from the model with the observed income Gini coefficient in \neach of the economies in our sample. The estimated parameters are then used to simulate the impact \nof raising human capital spending on labor productivity, income inequality, and fiscal balance.  \n \nIn addition to the above model, we also employ a heuristic model using the Philippines as a case \nstudy. The model is based on subnational NTA estimates. Let (cid:1864) (cid:4666)(cid:1876),(cid:1862)(cid:4667), (cid:1864) (cid:4666)(cid:1876),(cid:1862)(cid:4667), and (cid:1877) (cid:4666)(cid:1876),(cid:1862)(cid:4667) be the average \n(cid:3034) (cid:3033) (cid:3039)\npublic and private human capital investments, and labor income, respectively, at each age (cid:1876) for an \nindividual from some class (cid:1862).  In this na\u00efve simulation, we assume that the labor income age profile is \ndirectly linked to the schedule of human capital investments, such that increasing human capital \nspending in some class (cid:1863)\tto match the higher spending in some class (cid:1864) leads to class (cid:1863) individuals earning \nlabor income at the same schedule as class (cid:1864) workers. We apply this model using recent subnational \nPhilippines NTA estimates calculated for terciles of household income by residence location (Abrigo et \nal. 2016). This application takes advantage of the increasing availability of subnational NTA estimates, \nand is in line with recent work which simulates the economic impact of counterfactual economic \nlifecycle schedules on specific subpopulations (Mejia-Guevara 2014; and Miller, Saad, and Martinez \n2016). \n ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 529 \nIII.  EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE PHILIPPINES CASE STUDY \n \nIn this section, we report and discuss the empirical results from a case study based on subnational data \nfrom the Philippines. Average labor incomes by age, socioeconomic class, and residence are presented \nin Figure 1. The labor income age profiles include earnings and benefits of employees, both those working \nlocally and abroad, and self-employment labor income, as well as imputed wages of unpaid family \nworkers. This measure captures age variations in labor force participation, hours worked, productivity, \nand other factors that influence labor supply decisions. Typical of labor income age profiles, it starts from \nzero when young, increases in adulthood, peaks at prime age, and then declines as people retire from the \nlabor market. \n \nFigure 1: Labor Income by Age, Income Group, and Residence: Philippines, 2011\n \nUrban: Low income Urban: Middle income Urban: High income\n500 500 500\n0 0 0\n01400 01400 01400\n2 2 2\no,  o,  o, \nes300 es300 es 300\np p p\nd  d  d \nn200 n200 n200\na a a\nus us us\nho 100 ho100 ho 100\nT T T\n0 0 0\n0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80\nAge Age Age\nRural: Low income Rural: Middle income Rural: High income\n500 500 500\n0 0 0\n01 400 01 400 01400\nThousand peso, 2 231000000 Thousand peso, 2 231000000 Thousand peso, 2231000000\n0 0 0\n0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80\nAge Age Age\nSelf-employment Earnings, domestic Earnings, overseas  \n \nSource: Abrigo et al. (2016). \n \nThe figure highlights not just stark differences in overall levels of income, but also important \ndifferences in labor income sources, and timing of labor force entry and exit. For instance, at peak \nproductive ages, the average labor incomes of workers from rich households are about quadruple those \nfrom low-income households in both rural and urban areas. As workers move up the socioeconomic \nladder, we see labor income to be increasingly compressed toward a narrower age band, reflecting the \nincreasing importance of paid employment in the formal economy in labor income. This trend may also \nreflect the degree of availability of different support systems accessible to populations at either end of \nthe economic lifecycle. For example, schooling keeps the young from working, but poverty may induce \nchildren to leave school and work for pay. Insufficient pension income may induce the elderly to \ncontinue working to support their consumption. ", "Human Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   7 \nAmong poorer households, self-employment labor income is an important source of support, \naccounting for as much as 36% of total labor income among low-income rural households, and as much \nas 18% for low-income urban households. The share of self-employment in total labor income declines \nprogressively with socioeconomic status as more workers enter formal labor markets, including those \noverseas. Among rich households, earnings from overseas employment account for about a third of total \nlabor  income  in  both  rural  and  urban  households.  This  share  declines  as  one  moves  down  the \nsocioeconomic ladder, although it remains substantial. Among low-income rural households, earnings \nfrom temporary international migration accounts for about 29% of all labor income, while the figure is \n23% for low-income urban households. It is noteworthy that the age profile of overseas labor income \npeaks at younger ages relative to the age profile of local labor income, indicating the age-based \nselectivity of international labor migration. \n \nThese differences in labor income profiles across subgroups are likely to persist into the future \nwhen we consider current human capital spending patterns. Figure 2 presents the age profile of average \nhuman capital spending by socioeconomic status and residence. Public and private spending on health \nand education are separated to compare and contrast differences across subpopulations. Similar to the \nlabor income age profiles, there is large disparity in human capital spending across groups, with per capita \nspending by age increasing with socioeconomic status, and between rural and urban households.  \n \nFigure 2: Human Capital Spending by Age, Income Group, and Residence: Philippines, 2011\n \nUrban: Low income Urban: Middle income Urban: High income\n60 60 60\nThousand peso, 20104200 Thousand peso, 20104200 Thousand peso, 20104200\n0 0 0\n0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25\nAge Age Age\nRural: Low income Rural: Middle income Rural: High income\n60 60 60\n0 0 0\n01 01 01\n2 2 2\neso, 40 eso, 40 eso, 40\np p p\nd  d  d \nn n n\nusa 20 usa 20 usa 20\no o o\nh h h\nT T T\n0 0 0\n0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25\nAge Age Age\nEducation, Private Education, Public Health, Private Health, Public  \n \nSource: Abrigo et al.

Among low-income \nrural households, for instance, 10% of total consumption is human capital spending. The share ranges \nbetween 6% and 8% in other socioeconomic groups. Among poorer households, public provision of \nhealth and education is an important aspect of investment in children, accounting for about 71% of total \nhuman capital spending among low-income urban households, and about 82% among low-income rural \nhouseholds. Among richer households, public provision plays only a secondary role, with about 92% of \nhuman capital spending on children in rich urban households and about 73% in rich rural households \ndone privately. \n \nIn terms of type of spending, education accounts for over half of human capital investments, \nalthough a significant uptick in health spending on infants and children is evident from the human capital \nspending age profiles of rich households. Public spending is largely skewed toward basic education, \nwhich partly reflects high public school participation rates, and partly reflects the government budget \nallocated to each education level. Private education spending, on the other hand, is more concentrated \nin postsecondary education. \n \nThe observed differences in human capital investments across subgroups, to some degree, may \nreflect their demographic conditions. Lee and Mason (2010), for instance, using cross-sectional NTA \ndata of human capital spending and fertility, estimate that a 1% drop in fertility is related to about a 1% \nincrease in lifetime human capital spending. This negative relationship between number of children and \nhuman capital spending can also be observed in the Philippines, not only in the cross-section data but \nalso in time series data.  \n \nFigure 3 shows a plot of human capital spending per capita summed over the relevant ages by \nsocioeconomic status and residence. The synthetic cohort estimates of human capital spending spans \n2 decades. The right-most estimates for each group are for 1991 and the left-most estimates are for 2011. \nWe use the ratio of young dependents ages 0\u201324 to adults ages 25 or higher as proxy for fertility. The \nnumber of young dependents per adult has declined over the years covered. At the same time, human \ncapital spending has increased, although the increase has been more rapid among richer households, \nwho coincidentally have lower young dependency ratio. While the plot does not indicate the direction \nof causation between the number of children and human capital investments, it does reflect a strong \nrelationship between the quantity and the quality of children. \n \nHow can targeted human capital spending interventions alleviate the current disparity in human \ncapital across the population? We experiment with alternative scenarios where average human capital \nspending and labor income age schedules of lower-income households are replaced by spending and \nincome patterns of higher-income households. This allows us to evaluate the possible impact of targeted \ninterventions to raise human capital spending in lower-income households. The profiles are all based on \n2011 Philippines subnational NTA estimates. We assume that the increase in human capital spending is \nborne entirely by the government.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Human Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   9 \nFigure 3: Human Capital Spending and Number of \nChildren: Philippines, 1991, 1999, and 2011 \n \n800\na \npit\nn capital spending per ca(thousand peso)nthetic cohort age 0\u201326) 642000000\na y\nm (s\nu\nH\n0\n0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50\nPopulation age 0\u201324/Population age 25+\nRural: Low income Rural: Middle income\nRural: High income Urban:  Low income\nUrban:  Middle income Urban:  High income  \n \nNote: The right-most estimate for each group refers to the 1991 estimate, the \nmiddle to the 1999 estimate, and the left-most to the 2011 estimate. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation based on data from Abrigo et al.

In the second \nscenario, the age profiles of lower-income populations are replaced by the age profiles of the next \nhigher-income class in our analysis, i.e., low-income profiles are replaced by middle-income profiles, and \nmiddle-income profiles are replaced by high-income profiles. In the last scenario, age profiles of low-\nincome urban households and of low-income and middle-income rural households are replaced by the \nage profiles of middle-income urban households. We then compare how the resulting distribution of \nhuman capital spending would change relative to a baseline scenario of no change in human capital \nspending. \n \nFigure 4 presents concentration curves of human capital spending under our four different \npolicy scenarios. The concentration curve plots the cumulative distribution of human capital spending, \nrepresenting benefits, on the vertical axis, and the cumulative distribution of population age 26 and \nbelow sorted by socioeconomic status, representing benefit recipients, on the horizontal axis. A \nconcentration curve above the 45-degree diagonal line indicates that the distribution of human capital \nspending is progressive, where spending on poorer households is larger than their share of the recipient \npopulation. A curve below the 45-degree line indicates that richer households receive a higher share of \nthe total human capital spending.  \n \nPanel A presents the observed benefit incidence of human capital spending in 2011. The plot \nindicates that total human capital spending is regressive. When disaggregated by source, we see that the \ndisparity is largely due to private spending, which is highly skewed toward richer households. Total \nhuman capital spending by government appears to be neutral. However, there are some nuances when \nthe distribution of public human capital spending is further disaggregated. When broken down by age, ", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 529 \npublic human capital spending is more progressive for younger children, i.e., those in basic education, \nand  slightly  regressive  for  older  children,  i.e.,  those  in  higher  education.

The concentration curves for private spending do not change across \nscenarios since we assume that the additional spending is borne by the government. Overall, the plots \nindicate that targeted spending alleviates inequalities in human capital investments as a result of \npropoor public human capital spending. However, there are some qualitative differences. Results from \nour simulation show that the urban-to-rural (panel B) and the low-to-middle/middle-to-high (panel C) \ntargeted human capital spending scenarios are likely to benefit middle-income households more than \nlow-income households. Setting a minimum level of human capital spending age schedule (panel D), \nwhich here we peg at the spending level of middle-income urban households, will benefit the poorest \nthe most. \n \nThe concentration curves in Figure 4 are summarized in Table 1 by calculating the implied Suits \nindex. The index ranges from \u20131 to 1, where a value of \u20131 indicates that all human capital spending goes ", "Human Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   11 \nto the poorest person in the economy, while a value of 1 signifies that all spending goes to the richest \nperson. At baseline, combined public and private human capital spending\u2019s Suits index is at 0.19. This is \ncomparable with the 0.24 estimated by Mesa (2007) using years of schooling in 2000. \n \nThe estimated Suits index confirms our earlier observation, based on concentration curves, that \ntargeted spending interventions reduce human capital inequality. Depending on the scenario, the Suits \nindex for total human capital spending drops by 2\u20135 percentage points. This is due to public human \ncapital spending becoming more progressive, with the Suits index ranging from \u20130.01 to \u20130.05 from a \nbaseline value of 0.01. Because of the higher spending among lower-income households, average \nlifetime human capital spending per person is projected to increase between 9% and 58% of the baseline \nlevel, with the government funding 45%\u201362% of the total spending from the baseline 40%. \n \nTable 1: Human Capital Spending and Inequality: Observed and Simulated \n \nHuman Capital Spending Suits Coefficient\nCombined Public Combined  Public \nSimulation Scenario  (% of baseline)  (% of total)  Spending  Spending \nBaseline (status quo)  100.0 40.0 0.19  0.01\nRural\u2013urban scenario  108.9 44.9 0.17  \u20130.01\nLow\u2013middle/Middle\u2013high scenario  158.4 62.1 0.15  \u20130.05\nUrban\u2013middle scenario  128.3 53.3 0.14  \u20130.05\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n \nThe increased human capital spending is projected to boost labor income by about 30%\u201350% \nof the baseline value.

Estimates that are closer to (more distant from) the origin \nsignify smaller (greater) human capital spending in total. \n \nFigure 5: Public versus Private Human Capital Spending \nin Developing Asia \n \n6.0\ne\nm\ng o\nnc\nendior in\nn capital spaverage labge 30\u201349) 4.0 MAL THA INO KOR\numan of of a 2.0 TIM\nPublic h(proportio 0 NEINPDBAPNHICAM VIE MON\n0  2.0  4.0  6.0\nPrivate human capital spending\n(proportion of average labor income of age 30\u201349)\nDeveloping Asia Rest of the world  \n \nBAN = Bangladesh, CAM = Cambodia, IND = India, INO = Indonesia,  \nKOR = Republic of Korea, MAL = Malaysia, MON = Mongolia, NEP = Nepal,  \nPHI = Philippines, THA = Thailand, TIM = Timor-Leste, VIE = Viet Nam. \nNotes: Lifetime public and private human capital spending is based on a synthetic \ncohort measure of health and education spending based on National Transfer \nAccounts data for a recent year.

In Bangladesh, on the other hand, the average lifetime human capital \nspending per person is only 1.4 years of prime-age labor income. Viet Nam and Timor-Leste spend about \n2.3 years of labor income on human capital per person, but Viet Nam relies largely on private spending \nrather than on government.

While the majority of Asian countries in our sample \nare investing around the average level of their income group, if not more, there are some countries like \nMalaysia, the Philippines, and Timor-Leste that invest substantially below the average.  \n \nFigure 6: Human Capital Spending and Gross National Income per Capita \n \n  (a) Total human capital spending  (b) Public share of human capital spending \n1.0\nKOR\nverage human capital spending per person(proportion of average labor income of age  30\u201349) 642...000CANMVEIEPINBINOAMDNPOTHINMI THA MAL Public human capital spending per person(proportion of total per person) 0000....6842 CNIABNEMADPVNIPETHIIIMNMOTOHNA MAL KOR\nA\n0 0\n0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 0  10,000  20,000  30,000  40,000  50,000\nPer capita GNI (2011 PPP$)   Per capita GNI (2011 PPP$)\nDeveloping Asia Rest of the world  \n \nBAN = Bangladesh, CAM = Cambodia, GNI = gross national income, IND = India, INO = Indonesia, KOR = Republic of Korea,  \nMAL = Malaysia, MON = Mongolia, NEP = Nepal, PHI = Philippines, PPP = purchasing power parity, THA = Thailand, TIM = Timor-Leste, \nVIE = Viet Nam.  \nNotes: Lifetime public and private human capital spending is based on a synthetic cohort measure of health and education spending \nbased on National Transfer Accounts data.

Lower-income countries are \nlikely to benefit more from increased human capital spending. Labor productivity in lower-income \ncountries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Nepal is projected to increase by 2%\u20133.5% as a result of a 20% \nexpansion of human capital spending per person. In more developed countries, like Malaysia and \nThailand, the projected impact is more modest. It is quite interesting that, among countries with similar \neconomic levels, for instance, Bangladesh and India, the projected impact of human capital spending on \nlabor productivity can differ quite substantially, reflecting their different population age profiles of \nproductivity. The simulated impact on productivity growth in the Republic of Korea and Nepal is about \nthe same despite the huge disparity in income level, suggesting that human capital spending may still \nbenefit higher-income countries despite the general reduction in impact as per capita income rises. \n \nIn addition, human capital spending has a significant impact on reducing inequality. Again, the \nimpact is greatest among lower-income countries than in more-developed economies. In Bangladesh, \nCambodia, Nepal, and Viet Nam, for instance, increased human capital spending is projected to bring \ndown income Gini coefficients by 3%\u20135% relative to baseline values. In more developed Thailand and \nMalaysia, the impact is more modest, ranging from 1% to 2% drop. \n \nThe welfare impact of human capital spending may be traced to its greater impact on poorer \nhouseholds, especially in lower-income countries (Table 3). In Bangladesh and Cambodia, for instance, \nlabor productivity among the poorest income quintile households is projected to increase by about 7%\u2013\n8%. The impact on higher-income households is also substantial, but smaller. \n \n \n \n ", "Human Capital Spending, Inequality, and Growth in Middle-Income Asia   |   15 \nTable 3: Simulated Impact of Human Capital Spending on Productivity Growth and Inequality \n \nProductivity Growth Rate (%) \n% Change in Inequality    by Income Quintile \nHuman  Labor  Q1  Q5  All \nCountry  Capital  Income    (poorest)  Q2  Q3  Q4  (richest)  Groups \nBangladesh  \u20136.7  \u20134.1 7.5 5.7 4.0 2.4  0.6  2.7\nCambodia  \u20137.2  \u20134.5 7.4 6.1 4.6 2.8  0.8  3.1\nIndia  \u20133.7  \u20132.1 3.4 3.3 2.8 2.0  0.3  1.6\nIndonesia  \u20132.3  \u20131.3 2.3 2.2 1.9 1.3  0.2  1.0\nRepublic of Korea  \u20135.1  \u20133.1 4.9 4.3 3.5 2.3  0.5  2.1\nMalaysia  \u20130.3  \u20130.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2  0.0  0.1\nMongolia  \u20135.8  \u20133.5 5.7 4.9 3.9 2.5  0.6  2.4\nNepal  \u20135.1  \u20133.1 4.7 4.3 3.5 2.4  0.5  2.2\nPhilippines  \u20134.3  \u20132.6 4.7 4.2 3.3 2.1  0.4  1.9\nThailand  \u20132.9  \u20131.7 2.6 2.6 2.5 1.9  0.3  1.3\nTimor-Leste  \u20134.5  \u20132.4 3.5 3.5 3.3 2.8  0.6  2.0\nViet Nam  \u20134.1  \u20132.5 4.7 3.9 2.9 1.7  0.3  1.7\nQ = Income quintile. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n \nThe increase in worker productivity is expected to benefit the government as well. The fiscal \neffect of greater human capital spending depends on each country\u2019s tax structure inasmuch as it \ndepends on the government\u2019s role in the increase in human capital spending and the effect of such \nspending on labor productivity. Personal income tax per capita in Cambodia and Timor-Leste, for \ninstance, is projected to increase by at least 3% (Table 4, panel A). In other countries, the projected \nimpact on government revenues are economically insignificant despite large gains in labor productivity.  \n \nThere are many different ways governments can intervene to increase human capital spending \nbesides a universal increase in spending. For instance, governments may target human capital spending \nexpansion only on vulnerable groups, while keeping current levels of spending on other groups. An alternative \nstrategy could be to increase the efficiency of public spending without increasing the level of spending. These \nstrategies are not mutually exclusive, and may be combined to create more targeted strategies. \n \nFor further analysis, we consider three types of targeted strategies. In the first strategy, we \nassume governments increase its spending per person by 20% of the average total human capital \nspending by age. We assume that there is no change in the government\u2019s efficiency in this scenario \n(strategy 1). In the second strategy, we assume a 20% increase in public efficiency in translating inputs \nto human capital, but we hold public spending at its baseline values (strategy 2). Finally, in the last \nscenario, we combine the two strategies, so there is a 20% increase in both human capital spending and \nhuman capital production efficiency (strategy 3). We then combine these three scenarios with three \ndifferent government targeting schemes; namely, a universal program where every household benefits \nfrom public human capital interventions, and targeted programs that are available only to either the \npoorest 40% or poorest 60% of households. Table 4 summarizes the projected effects of different public \nhuman capital interventions on Asia. \n \nIn all of the strategies considered, government revenues are projected to increase, with labor \nincome per capita growing by as much as 3%\u20135% in some scenarios in some countries. Increasing both \npublic efficiency and public provision of human capital spending seems to result in greater increase in \ntax collection per capita, relative to the combined impact of separately pursuing each intervention. \nThere is a modest negative change, if at all, in effective tax rates, indicating that household labor income \nwill grow faster than the amount collected from them in taxes by the government.

In \ngeneral, strategies that increase production efficiency without increasing inputs have little positive to no \neffect on the overall fiscal rate of return from public human capital spending (panel B). Increasing public \nspending is projected to decrease the overall fiscal rate of return (panels A and C), although the rates \nremain positive in all scenarios. \n \n \nV.  CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS \n \nIn this paper, we empirically examine the effect of human capital spending on economic growth, \nincome inequality, and fiscal balance in Asia. To do so, we perform a case study of the Philippines \nusing subnational data and simulate the impact of human capital spending on growth, inequality, and \nfiscal balance in 12 Asian economies. Asia\u2019s rapid population aging and its transformation into a \nmiddle-income region portend a bigger role for human capital in the region\u2019s future growth. The main \nchannel through which human capital affects growth and inequality is through its effect on labor \nincome. Improved labor productivity boosts output and income and, to the extent that the poor \nexperience a larger improvement, it also helps to reduce income inequality. Although human capital \nspending is costly for governments, its positive impact on income expands the tax base and, thus, \ngovernment revenues. \n \nOur major source of data is the NTA database, which consists of household data that document \neconomic flows across populations of different ages. The results of our empirical analysis indicate that \nhuman  capital  investment  promotes  both  output  growth  and  income  equality  in  Asia,  and  thus \ncontributes to more inclusive growth in the region. Poorer households experience a relatively larger \nincrease in their labor income, which enables them to narrow the income gap with richer households. \nFurther, the growth impact is larger for poorer Asian countries than for richer countries.  We also find \nthat public investment is more beneficial for equity than private investment.  All in all, our evidence is \nconsistent with the conventional wisdom that public spending on human capital fosters greater equality \nof opportunity. Further, our evidence suggests that the expansion of tax base and fiscal revenues more \nthan offsets the cost of such spending. Overall, our evidence points to a positive effect of human capital \non growth, equity, and fiscal balance in Asia. \n \nIt should be pointed out that our benign simulated outcomes are not a guarantee of benign \nactual outcomes. The extent to which human capital investment benefits economic growth, income \ninequality, and fiscal balance will depend in part on how human capital spending is transformed to \nproductive labor. Thus, other government policies and the overall economic environment also come into \nplay. For example, a more flexible labor market will facilitate the transformation of human capital into \nproductive employment. We also looked at three different modes of government intervention on human \ncapital; namely, a universal increase in human capital spending, a targeted increase in human capital \nspending only for vulnerable groups, and an increase in the efficiency of human capital spending. Again, \nit should be noted that these strategies are not mutually exclusive, and there is plenty of scope for \ncombining  them  with  each  other  to  create  better  targeted  strategies.  The  important  issue  of \neffectiveness of private versus public human capital spending on productivity growth is not much in \ndetail here, and is left for future studies. \n ", "\u00a0\nREFERENCES \n \nAbrigo, Michael R.
