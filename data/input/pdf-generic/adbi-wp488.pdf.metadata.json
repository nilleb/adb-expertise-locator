INTRODUCTION \nA key lesson of the 2007\u20132009 global financial crisis (GFC) was the importance of \ncontaining systemic financial risk and maintaining financial stability. At the same time, \ndeveloping economies are seeking to promote financial inclusion, i.e., greater access \nto financial services for low-income households and small firms, as part of their overall \nstrategies for economic and financial development. This raises the question of whether \nfinancial  stability  and  financial  inclusion  are,  broadly  speaking,  substitutes  or \ncomplements. In other words, does the move toward greater financial inclusion tend to \nincrease or decrease financial stability? A number of studies have suggested both \npositive and negative ways in which financial inclusion could affect financial stability, \nbut very few empirical studies have been made of the relationship. This partly reflects \nthe scarcity and relative newness of data on financial inclusion. This study contributes \nto  the  literature  on  this  subject  by  estimating  the  effects  of  various  measures  of \nfinancial inclusion (together with some control variables) on some measures of financial \nstability. We find some evidence that an increased share of lending to small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  aids  financial  stability,  mainly  by  reducing  the \nnumber of non-performing loans (NPLs) and lowering the probability of default by \nfinancial institutions. \nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the definitions of financial \nstability  and  financial  inclusion,  and  describes  possible  channels  for  interactions \nbetween the two. Section 3 describes the available data on financial stability and \nfinancial inclusion, including limitations imposed by the relative scarcity of the latter. \nSection 4 presents stylized facts of the relationship between financial stability and \nfinancial inclusion. Section 5 surveys the previous literature in this area. Section 6 \ndescribes  the  model  used  in  this  paper  and  the  econometric  results.  Section  7 \nconcludes the paper. \n2.  FINANCIAL STABILITY AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION \nThis section provides some definitions of financial stability and financial inclusion, and \ndiscusses the channels by which increases in financial inclusion might affect financial \nstability. \n2.1  Financial Stability \nThe  GFC  has  heightened  awareness  of  financial  stability  and  the  need  for  a \nmacroprudential dimension to financial surveillance and regulation. Nonetheless, there \nis no generally agreed definition of financial stability, because financial systems are \ncomplex with multiple dimensions, institutions, products, and markets. Indeed, it is \nperhaps easier to describe financial instability than stability. The European Central \nBank website defines financial stability as: \n\u201c\u2026 a condition in which the financial system\u2014comprising of financial intermediaries, \nmarkets  and  market  infrastructures\u2014is  capable  of  withstanding  shocks,  thereby \nreducing the likelihood of disruptions in the financial intermediation process which are \nsevere enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable investment \nopportunities.\u201d (ECB 2012)  \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \nFurther, the ECB defines three particular conditions associated with financial stability: \n1.  The  financial  system  should  be  able  to  efficiently  and  smoothly  transfer \nresources from savers to investors.  \n2. Financial risks should be assessed and priced reasonably accurately and should \nalso be relatively well managed.  \n3. The financial system should be in such a condition that it can comfortably \nabsorb financial and real economic surprises and shocks. (ECB 2012) \nPerhaps the third condition is the most important, because the inability to absorb \nshocks  can  lead  to  a  downward  spiral  whereby  they  are  propagated  through  the \nsystem and become self-reinforcing, leading to a general financial crisis and broadly \ndisrupting the financial intermediation mechanism. \nSchinasi (2004:8) proposes, at a more theoretical level: \n\u201cA financial system is in a range of stability whenever it is capable of facilitating (rather \nthan impeding) the performance of an economy, and of dissipating financial imbalances \nthat arise endogenously or as a result of significant adverse and unanticipated events.\u201d \nAgain, the emphasis is on resilience to shocks and a continued ability to effectively \nperform the basic function of mediating savings and investment (and consumption) in \nthe real economy. \nIn a similar vein, threats to financial stability are considered to pose systemic risks. The \nCommittee on Global Financial Stability (CGFS 2010:2) defines systemic risk as \u201ca risk \nof disruption to financial services that is caused by an impairment of all or parts of the \nfinancial system and has the potential to have serious negative consequences for the \nreal economy.\u201d \nBorio  (2011) classifies financial  system  risk  into  two  dimensions\u2014time  and cross-\nsectional. The first involves dealing with how aggregate risk in the financial system \nevolves over time. This is known as the tendency toward procyclicality of the financial \nsystem as a result of positive feedback between the economy and the financial system, \nthe  so-called  macro-financial  channel.  These  feedback  loops  can  emerge  from  a \nnumber of different channels, including the following: \n(i)  Bank capital/lending. A decline in bank capital forces it to cut back on lending, \nbut in the aggregate this can negatively affect the economy, leading to further \nlosses of capital, etc. \n(ii) Asset value/bank lending. A decline in values of assets such as real estate \nused for collateral means banks can lend less, but reduced bank lending may \ncause asset values to fall further, etc. \n(iii) Exchange  rate/balance  sheet  interactions  (currency  mismatches).  A \ndecline in the exchange rate leads to a deterioration of net assets if firms have \nborrowed in foreign currencies, but such deterioration can weaken economic \ngrowth, leading to further currency depreciation, etc. \n(iv) Liquidity\u2014interbank  and  other  money  markets  (maturity  mismatches). \nLoss of confidence in the banking sector can lead to \u201cruns\u201d on deposits or other \nshort-term financing, further decreasing confidence, etc. \n(v) Leverage. Weak economic growth may lead to capital losses that increase \nleverage, leading to reduced bank lending and further economic weakness, etc. \n(vi) Interest rate/credit risk. Rising interest rates may reduce the ability of firms to \nrepay debt, leading to higher risk premiums reflected in higher interest rates, \netc. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \nThe cross-sectional dimension involves dealing with how risk is allocated within the \nfinancial system at a point in time as a result of common exposures and interlinkages in \nthe financial system. These linkages may include: \n(i)  common  exposures  to  similar  asset  classes,  such  as  mortgage  loans  or \nsecuritized financial products; \n(ii) indirect exposures through counterparty risks; \n(iii) ownership structure; \n(iv) exposure to systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs); \n(v) infrastructure-based risks that may arise in payment or settlement systems, \nsuch as centralized clearing parties; and \n(vi) the level of financial development. \n2.2  Financial Inclusion \nFinancial  inclusion  is  more  straightforward  to  define  and  recognize.  Lower-income \ncountries tend to see a large portion of their population and firms not having access to \nformal financial services for a number of reasons, including: limited branch networks of \nbanks and other financial institutions; limited availability of automatic teller machines \n(ATMs); the relatively high costs of servicing small deposits and loans; limitations on \nsatisfactory personal identification; and limitations on collaterizable assets and credit \ninformation. Two definitions are: \n\u201cFinancial inclusion aims at drawing the \u201cunbanked\u201d population into the formal financial \nsystem so that they have the opportunity to access financial services ranging from \nsavings, payments, and transfers to credit and insurance.\u201d (Hannig and Jansen 2010) \n\u201c\u2026 the process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit \nwhere needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low income groups \nat an affordable cost. It primarily represents access to a bank account backed by \ndeposit insurance, access to affordable credit and the payments system.\u201d (Khan 2011) \nFinancial inclusion is most commonly thought of in terms of access to credit from a \nformal financial institution, but the concept has more dimensions. Formal accounts \ninclude both loans and deposits, and can be considered from the point of view of their \nfrequency of use, mode of access, and the purposes of the accounts. There may also \nbe alternatives to formal accounts, such as mobile money via mobile telephones. The \nmain other financial service besides banking is insurance, especially for health and \nagriculture (Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper 2012). \n2.3  Interactions between Financial Inclusion and Financial \nStability \nIn this paper we focus on the train of causality from financial inclusion to financial \nstability. In other words, does an increase in financial inclusion tend to enhance or \nworsen financial stability? This is because scholars have suggested both positive and \nnegative ways that rising financial inclusion could affect financial stability. Alternatively, \none could ask if an increase in financial stability leads to an increase in financial \ninclusion. However, this direction seems less interesting, as it seems unlikely that an \nincrease in financial stability would lead to a decrease in financial inclusion.  \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \nKhan  (2011)  suggests  three  main  ways  in  which  greater  financial  inclusion  can \ncontribute positively to financial stability. First, greater diversification of bank assets as \na result of increased lending to smaller firms could reduce the overall riskiness of a \nbank\u2019s loan portfolio. This would both reduce the relative size of any single borrower in \nthe overall portfolio and reduce its volatility. According to the scheme described in the \nprevious section, this would reduce the \u201cinter-connectedness\u201d risks of the financial \nsystem. Second, increasing the number of small savers would increase both the size \nand stability of the deposit base, reducing banks\u2019 dependence on \u201cnon-core\u201d financing, \nwhich tends to be more volatile during a crisis. This corresponds to a reduction of \nprocyclicality risk. Third, greater financial inclusion could also contribute to a better \ntransmission of monetary policy, also contributing to greater financial stability. \nHannig and Jansen (2010) argue that low-income groups are relatively immune to \neconomic cycles, so that including them in the financial sector will tend to raise the \nstability of the deposit and loan bases. They note anecdotal evidence that suggests \nthat financial institutions catering to the lower end tend to weather macro-crises well \nand help sustain local economic activity. Prasad (2010) also observes that lack of \nadequate  access  to  credit  for  small  and  medium-size  enterprises  and  small-scale \nentrepreneurs  has  adverse  effects  on  overall  employment  growth  since  these \nenterprises tend to be much more labor intensive in their operations. \nKhan (2011) also cites a number of ways in which increased financial inclusion could \ncontribute negatively to financial stability. The most obvious example is if an attempt to \nexpand the pool of borrowers results in a reduction in lending standards. This was a \nmajor contributor to the severity of the \u201csub-prime\u201d crisis in the United States. Second, \nbanks could increase their reputational risk if they outsource various functions such as \ncredit  assessment  in  order  to  reach  smaller  borrowers.  Finally,  if  microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) are not properly regulated, an increase in lending by that group \ncould  dilute  the  overall  effectiveness  of  regulation  in  the  economy  and  increase \nfinancial system risks. \n3.  DATA ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND FINANCIAL \nSTABILITY \nThe single most important cross-country database in this area is the World Bank\u2019s \n1\nGlobal  Financial  Development  database  (GFDD).  It  includes  a  large  number  of \nvariables related to financial inclusion, together with macroeconomic variables and \nsome variables related to financial development and financial stability. The database \ncovers 164 economies, and has data series for as long as 52 years (since 1960), \nalthough  the  time  series  for  the  variables  of  greatest  interest  are  much  shorter. \nExamples  of  variables  related  to  financial  inclusion  include  the  number  of  bank \nbranches per 100,000 people, the number of bank accounts per 1,000 people, the \npercentage of firms with a line of credit to total firms, the percentage of adults either \nsaving at or borrowing from a financial institution in the past year, and the percentage \nof adults with at least one account at a formal financial institution. The GFDD includes \nextensive survey data on financial access from the World Bank\u2019s Global Financial \nInclusion Database (Global Findex), which provides statistics on financial inclusion for \n                                                \n1 The GFDD database is available at: \nhttp://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTGLOBALFINREPORT/0,,contentMDK:23\n269602~pagePK:64168182~piPK:64168060~theSitePK:8816097,00.html. A description of the database \ncan be found in Chapter 1 of World Bank (2013) and also in Cih\u00e1k et al. (2012).  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \n148 economies, including indicators on how people save, borrow, make payments, and \n2\nmanage risk.   \nIn the GFDD, data on the number of bank branches are typically available for about 8 \nyears (2004\u20132011), but many economies have some missing data. Data from the \nGlobal Findex database, however, are available only for 2011, including the percent of \nadults with at least one account (or loan) at a formal financial institution, which is \narguably the single best measure of inclusion, at least for households. This means that \nthis variable can be used only in cross-section analysis, not panel data, which severely \nlimits the number of potential observations that can be used. The situation is only \nmarginally better for data on the percentage of firms having a line of credit, for either \ntotal firms or SMEs. In this case, economies for which data are available generally \nshow one or two observations, but again, many economies have no values. Thus, data \navailability  for  financial  inclusion  variables  is  a  major  problem  that  confronts \nresearchers in this area. \nExamples of data on financial stability in the GFDD include bank Z-scores (an indicator \nof  the  probability  of  default  of  the  country\u2019s  banking  system),  the  ratio  of  non-\nperforming loans (NPLs), the ratio of bank credit to bank deposits, the ratio of bank \nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets, and the ratio of bank liquid assets to deposits \nand short-term funding. Data on these items typically are available for at least 10 years, \nand in some cases considerably longer, although, again, there are many gaps in \ncountry coverage. Therefore scarcity of data related to financial stability is less of an \nissue than for data related to financial inclusion. \nThe  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  (IMF)  Financial  Access  Survey  (FAS)  provides \nadditional useful data, including inclusion data for non-bank financial institutions such \nas credit unions, insurance companies, and MFIs, as well as the availability of ATMs \n3\nand  the  amount  of  commercial  bank  loans  and  deposits  to  SMEs.  Since  it  also \nincludes total commercial loans and deposits, the data can be used to calculate the \nshare of SMEs in total commercial bank loans and deposits, an important measure of \ninclusion. The database covers 193 economies and has time series for up to 9 years \n(2004\u20132012), although again there are many missing values, so the effective size of \nthe database is much smaller.  \nAdditional measures of financial stability include the identification of periods of financial \ncrises. Reinhart and Rogoff (2009, 2010) compiled an exhaustive global list of periods \nof financial crises of various types dating back to 1800. Another database by Laeven \nand Valencia (2008) identifies 124 systemic banking crises over the period 1970\u20132007. \nHowever, Laeven and Valencia (2008) only identify the year associated with the onset \nof a banking crisis, while Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) identify the entire period of a \ncrisis, so the latter database is more useful for quantifying the severity of a crisis. \n4.  STYLIZED FACTS OF FINANCIAL STABILITY AND \nFINANCIAL INCLUSION \nThis section provides some simple comparisons of the relationship between measures \nof financial inclusion and financial stability obtained from the databases described in \n                                                \n2 The Global Findex database is available at:  \nhttp://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/variableselection/selectvariables.aspx?source=global-findex-\n(global-financial-inclusion-database). Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper (2012) provides a detailed discussion \nof how the data were obtained. \n3 The IMF FAS database can be accessed at http://fas.imf.org/. \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \nthe previous section. The first point is that financial inclusion increases along with per \ncapita GDP (Figure 1). The chart indicates that financial access tends to be less than \n20% when per capita income is below $1,000, and exceeds 80% when per capita \nincome exceeds $30,000. \nFigure 1: Share of Adults with an Account at One or More Formal Financial \nInstitution versus per Capita GDP \n100\nal \nm 80\nr\no\nf\nat n \nnt tio60\nuu\nwith accocial instit40\ns an\ndultfin20\na\nf \no\n%  0\n5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nLog of GDP per capita \n   \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: World Bank Global Financial Inclusion Database (2012), 2011 data. \nHowever, there is little correlation between adult access to formal financial accounts \nand financial stability measures. For example, Figure 2 shows that the plot of NPLs \nversus the share of adults with an account at at least one formal financial institution is \nvirtually flat. The chart for banks\u2019 Z-scores versus adult account access looks very \nsimilar. \nFigure 2: Share of Adults with an Account at One or More Formal Financial \nInstitution versus Bank NPLs \n35\n30\ntal 25\no\nt\nf \n% o20\ns, \nL15\nP\nN\nk  10\nn\na\nB\n5\n0\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nAdults with account at formal financial institution, % of \ntotal \n \nGDP = gross domestic product, NPL = non-performing loan. \nSource: World Bank Global Financial Inclusion Database (2012), 2011 data. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \nResults are somewhat more promising when looking at firms\u2019 access to financing. \nFigure 3 shows that there is some correlation between the share of SMEs obtaining \nfinance and bank NPLs. The downward sloping line implies that increasing access of \nSMEs to finance tends to reduce the share of bank NPLs, which is in line with the \npositive factor identified in Section 3. However, the number of data points is small and \nthe degree of dispersion is fairly wide, so these results have to be taken with caution. \nFigure 3: Bank NPLs and the Share of SMEs in Total Commercial Bank Loans \n30\n25\nal \nt\no20\nt\nf \no\n% \ns, 15\nL\nP\nN\nk 10\nn\na\nB\n5\n0\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nSME outstanding loans, % of total \n \nNPL = non-performing loan, SME = small and medium-sized enterprise. \nSource: IMF Global Financial Access Survey (2013), 2001\u20132011 average. \nIn summary, the link between per capita income and financial inclusion is fairly clear, \nbut the link between financial inclusion and financial stability is less clear. Section 6 \npresents  our  analytical model  and  econometric  results for  some measures  of this \nrelationship.  \n5.  SURVEY OF EARLIER STUDIES \nAs mentioned above, empirical work in this area is scarce. In a study of Chilean banks, \nAdasme, Majnoni, and Uribe (2006) found that the NPLs of small firms have quasi-\nnormal loss distributions, while those of large firms have fat-tailed distributions. They \nnote that the quasi-normality of small loans\u2019 loss curves means that the occurrence of \nlarge and infrequent losses is a major concern, and therefore lending processes to this \nclass can be greatly simplified. This implies that the systemic risk of the former group is \nless than that of the latter, so increased loans to SMEs should reduce the overall \nriskiness of banks\u2019 lending portfolios, i.e., it should be positive for financial stability, in \nline with our preliminary finding in the previous section.  \nHan  and  Melecky  (2013)  analyzed  the  World  Bank  data  described  above.  They \nhypothesized that a greater share of people with bank deposits would increase banks\u2019 \nshares of stable funding (deposits), and tend to reduce volatility of total bank deposits \nduring economic downturns, thereby contributing to financial stability by reducing the \nprocyclical effect of economic downturns on bank liquidity. Their dependent variable \nwas  the  maximum  drop  in  bank  deposit  growth  between  2006  and  2010.  For \nindependent variables, they used two different measures of financial inclusion\u2014an \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \nindex of Honohan (2008) measuring access to bank deposits before the 2008 crisis \nperiod and the Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper (2012) measure of the share of people that \nwere  using  banking  deposits  in  2011,  cited  previously,  plus  a  number  of  control \nvariables. They found that a 10% increase in the share of people that have access to \nbank deposits can reduce the deposit growth drops (or deposit withdrawal rates) by 3\u2013\n8 percentage points, which supports the case that financial inclusion is positive for \nfinancial stability. \n6.  MODEL, DATA, AND RESULTS \nTo formally verify the link between financial stability and financial inclusion, we estimate \nthe following dynamic-panel equation: \n  finstab  = \u03b1(fininclusion  )+ \u03b2X  + \u03b5 ,       (1) \ni,t  i,t i,t i,t \nwhere finstab is the measure of financial stability; fininclusion is the measure of \ni,t  i,t \nfinancial inclusion; X is a vector of controls (logarithm of GDP per capita [lgdp ], private \ni,t\ncredit by deposit money banks and other financial institutions to GDP [cgdp ], liquid \ni,t\nassets to deposits and short-term funding [liq ], non-FDI capital flow to GDP [nfdi ] and \ni,t i,t\nfinancial openness [opns ]); \u03b2 are a set of nuisance parameters; \u03b5 is an error term; i = \ni,t i,t \n1, \u2026, N represents the country; and t = 1, \u2026, T represents time. Finally, \u03b1 is the \ncoefficient of interest to us, which measures the effect of financial inclusion on financial \nstability.   \nTo estimate equation (1), this study employs panel data for the period 2005\u20132011, the \nperiod for which data on the two measures of financial inclusion employed in this \nsection are made available from the World Bank\u2019s GFDD and the IMF\u2019s FAS. The two \nmeasures of financial inclusion used in the analysis are SME outstanding loans as a \nproportion of total outstanding loans of commercial banks (smel ), and the number of \ni,t\nSME borrowers as a proportion of the total number of borrowers from commercial \nbanks (semb ). We also used two measures of financial stability in the regressions, \ni,t\nnamely, bank Z-score (bzs ) (defined as the sum of capital to assets and return on \ni,t\nassets divided by the standard deviation of return on assets) and  bank NPLs as a \nproportion of gross loans by banks (npl ). Both measures of financial stability were also \ni,t\nobtained from the GFDD. The data on GDP per capita and the capital flow data used to \ngenerate the ratio of non-FDI capital flow to GDP were obtained from the World Bank\u2019s \nWorld  Development  Indicators  database.  The  data  used  to  generate  the  financial \nopenness  variable  were  obtained from  the  Lane  and  Milesi-Ferretti  (2007) foreign \nassets and foreign liabilities database. Finally, the ratio of private credit by deposit \nmoney banks and other financial institutions to GDP and the ratio of liquid assets to \ndeposits and short-term funding were obtained from the GFDD. \nTables 1 and 2 report the descriptive statistics and the correlations, respectively, of the \nvariables used in the empirical analysis that follows. One important caveat from Table 1 \nis that, while most of the variables have at least 1,000 available observations, the \nnumber of available observations for the two measures of financial inclusion is quite \nproblematic, with smel  and semb  having only 266 and 161 available observations, \ni,t i,t\nrespectively. The correlations in Table 2 are quite low, particularly those among the \nright-hand side variables, which suggests that multicollinearity is not likely to be an \nissue in our empirical analysis.    \n   \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics \nVariable  Obs  Mean  Std Dev  Min  Max \nbzs  1888  15.08  9.98  -6.17  70.51 \nnpl  1034  6.67  7.20  0.10  74.10 \nsmel  266  0.27  0.20  0.00  0.85 \nsemb  161  0.17  0.27  0.00  0.96 \nlgdp  1975  8.72  1.30  5.47  11.39 \ncgdp  1820  49.88  50.07  0.55  434.09 \nliq  1809  38.75  20.71  0.32  146.23 \nnfdi  1141  6.37  27.28  -137.92  314.08 \nopns  1975  381.60  1612.61  27.20  24143.10 \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \nTable 2: Correlations of the Variables \nVariable  bzs  npl  smel  semb  lgdp  cgdp  liq  nfdi  opns \nbzs  1 \n               \nnpl  0.2846  1 \n             \nsmel  0.042  0.6784  1 \n           \nsemb  -0.0807  0.1081  -0.1113  1 \n         \nlgdp  0.0923  -0.1351  -0.0708  0.0193  1 \n       \ncgdp  -0.375  0.2112  0.3305  0.1689  0.3389  1 \n     \nliq  0.4688  -0.0626  0.1827  -0.1593  0.1707  -0.207  1 \n   \nnfdi  -0.1117  -0.1634  -0.3901  -0.1541  -0.1867  0.2191  -0.2629  1 \n \nopns  -0.1793  -0.2067  -0.0934  -0.1408  0.7219  0.4878  0.1164  0.0994  1 \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \nWe estimate equation (1) above using the system-GMM dynamic panel estimator of \nBlundell and Bond (1998). System-GMM is based on a system composed of first-\ndifferences instrumented on lagged levels, and of levels instrumented on lagged first-\ndifferences. In addition to providing a rigorous remedy for endogeneity bias, dynamic \npanel  GMM  estimation  holds  two  further  attractions.  First,  it  is  more  robust  to \nmeasurement error than cross-sectional regressions. Second, dynamic panel GMM \nremains consistent even if the explanatory variables are endogenous in the sense that \nE[X\u03b5] \u2260 0 for s \u2264 t, if the instrumental variables are sufficiently lagged.      \nt s\nWe employ the two-step estimator, and correct the standard errors of the two-step \nestimator for small-sample bias by applying the correction suggested by Windmeijier \n(2005). The maximum number of lags of the instrument sets is constrained in some \nspecifications to avoid over-fitting. We report Hansen tests to test for over-identifying \nrestrictions (Blundell and Bond 1998).

In three (columns \n[1]\u2013[3]) of our four regressions, income as measured by lgdp  significantly affects \ni,t\nfinancial stability, that is, high-income countries are less prone to financial instability. In \nline with the previous literature (e.g., Drehmann et al [2011]; Gourinchas and Obstfeld \n[2012]; Drehmann and Juselius [2013]), we also find in three (columns [1]\u2013[3]) of our \nfour regressions that higher private sector credit relative to GDP (cgdp ) leads to a \ni,t\nhigher likelihood of financial instability. Following on from Han and Melecky (2013), in \ntwo (columns [1] and [2]) of our four regressions, we find that greater liquidity by banks \n(liq ) leads to greater financial stability via a lower probability of default by financial \ni,t\ninstitutions. At the same time, though, we also obtain evidence that greater liquidity by \nbanks (liq ) leads to higher bank NPLs (column 3). In line with the previous result \ni,t\nobtained by Calderon and Serven (2011), in three of the four GMM regressions, we find \nthat the ratio of non-FDI capital flows to GDP (nfdi ) does not have a significant effect \ni,t\non financial stability, whereas, in one of the regressions we find a counter-intuitive \nresult that short-term capital flows lead to lower bank NPLs. Finally, in line with the \nresult obtained by Frankel and Saravelos (2012), we find in only one (though it was \nweakly significant) of the four regressions that financial openness (opns ) can lead to \ni,t\ngreater financial stability. \nThe standard diagnostic tests of the four regressions presented in Table 3 suggest no \nmisspecification problems, with the AR2 test failing to reject the null hypothesis of no \nsecond-order  residual  autocorrelation,  while  the  Hansen  test  for  over-identifying \n4\nrestrictions also fails to reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are valid.            \n7.  CONCLUSIONS \nThis  paper  has  examined  the  relationship  between  financial  stability  and  financial \ninclusion  to  examine  whether  they  are  mutually  reinforcing,  or  whether  there  are \nsubstantial  trade-offs  between  them.  The  literature  suggests  that  greater  financial \ninclusion could be either positive or negative for financial stability. Positive effects \ninclude:  diversification  of  bank  assets,  thereby  reducing  their  riskiness;  increased \nstability of their deposit base, reducing liquidity risks; and improved transmission of \nmonetary policy. Negative effects include the erosion of credit standards (e.g., sub-\nprime), bank reputational risk, and inadequate regulation of MFIs. \nFinancial inclusion data are problematic because of their short time span and limited \navailability.  Some  variables  only  have  1  year  of  observation,  and  others  only  2. \nHowever, working with panel data, in spite of the relatively small size, we are able to \ncontrol for the more serious issue of endogeneity through the use of the system-GMM \ndynamic panel estimator. \nPrevious studies tended to find positive effects of greater financial inclusion on financial \nstability,  i.e.,  that  the  two  are  complementary  rather  than  there  being  a  trade-off \nbetween them. Our estimation work also supports this. Specifically, we find evidence \nthat an increased share of lending to SMEs in total bank lending aids financial stability, \nmainly by a reduction of NPLs and a lower probability of default by financial institutions. \nThis suggests that policy measures to increase financial inclusion, at least by SMEs, \nwould have the side benefit of contributing to financial stability as well. We also find \nthat higher per capita GDP tends to increase financial stability, while a higher ratio of \n                                                \n4 Though the p-value of 1.0 of the Hansen test in column (2) suggests over-fitting, this is probably due to \nthe relatively small sample size in our regressions.  \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 488                       Morgan and Pontines \n \nprivate bank credit to GDP reduces financial stability.
