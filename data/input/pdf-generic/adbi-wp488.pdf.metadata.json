INTRODUCTION \n\nA  key  lesson  of  the  2007\u20132009  global  financial  crisis  (GFC)  was  the  importance  of \ncontaining systemic financial risk and maintaining financial stability. At the same time, \ndeveloping  economies  are  seeking  to  promote  financial  inclusion,  i.e.,  greater  access \nto financial services for low-income households and small firms, as part of their overall \nstrategies for economic and financial development. This raises the question of whether \nfinancial  stability  and  financial \ninclusion  are,  broadly  speaking,  substitutes  or \ncomplements. In other words, does the move toward greater financial inclusion tend to \nincrease  or  decrease  financial  stability?  A  number  of  studies  have  suggested  both \npositive  and  negative  ways  in  which  financial  inclusion  could  affect  financial  stability, \nbut very few empirical studies have been made of the relationship. This partly reflects \nthe scarcity and relative newness of data on financial inclusion. This study contributes \nto  the  literature  on  this  subject  by  estimating  the  effects  of  various  measures  of \nfinancial inclusion (together with some control variables) on some measures of financial \nstability.  We  find  some  evidence  that  an  increased  share  of  lending  to  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  aids  financial  stability,  mainly  by  reducing  the \nnumber  of  non-performing  loans  (NPLs)  and  lowering  the  probability  of  default  by \nfinancial institutions. \n\nThe  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  examines  the  definitions  of  financial \nstability  and  financial  inclusion,  and  describes  possible  channels  for  interactions \nbetween  the  two.  Section  3  describes  the  available  data  on  financial  stability  and \nfinancial  inclusion,  including  limitations  imposed  by  the  relative  scarcity  of  the  latter. \nSection  4  presents  stylized  facts  of  the  relationship  between  financial  stability  and \nfinancial  inclusion.  Section  5  surveys  the  previous  literature  in  this  area.  Section  6 \ndescribes  the  model  used  in  this  paper  and  the  econometric  results.  Section  7 \nconcludes the paper. \n\n2.  FINANCIAL STABILITY AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION \n\nThis section provides some definitions of financial stability and financial inclusion, and \ndiscusses the  channels by  which  increases  in financial  inclusion  might affect financial \nstability. \n\n2.1  Financial Stability \n\nThe  GFC  has  heightened  awareness  of  financial  stability  and  the  need  for  a \nmacroprudential dimension to financial surveillance and regulation. Nonetheless, there \nis  no  generally  agreed  definition  of  financial  stability,  because  financial  systems  are \ncomplex  with  multiple  dimensions,  institutions,  products,  and  markets.  Indeed,  it  is \nperhaps  easier  to  describe  financial  instability  than  stability.  The  European  Central \nBank website defines financial stability as: \n\n\u201c\u2026  a  condition  in  which  the  financial  system\u2014comprising  of  financial  intermediaries, \nmarkets  and  market  infrastructures\u2014is  capable  of  withstanding  shocks,  thereby \nreducing the likelihood of disruptions in the financial intermediation process which are \nsevere enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable investment \nopportunities.\u201d (ECB 2012)  \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nFurther, the ECB defines three particular conditions associated with financial stability: \n\n1.  The  financial  system  should  be  able  to  efficiently  and  smoothly  transfer \nresources from savers to investors.  \n\n2. Financial risks should be assessed and priced reasonably accurately and should \nalso be relatively well managed.  \n\n3.  The  financial  system  should  be  in  such  a  condition  that  it  can  comfortably \nabsorb financial and real economic surprises and shocks. (ECB 2012) \n\nPerhaps  the  third  condition  is  the  most  important,  because  the  inability  to  absorb \nshocks  can  lead  to  a  downward  spiral  whereby  they  are  propagated  through  the \nsystem  and  become  self-reinforcing,  leading  to  a  general  financial  crisis  and  broadly \ndisrupting the financial intermediation mechanism. \n\nSchinasi (2004:8) proposes, at a more theoretical level: \n\n\u201cA financial system is in a range of stability whenever it is capable of facilitating (rather \nthan impeding) the performance of an economy, and of dissipating financial imbalances \nthat arise endogenously or as a result of significant adverse and unanticipated events.\u201d \n\nAgain,  the  emphasis  is  on  resilience  to  shocks  and  a  continued  ability  to  effectively \nperform  the  basic function  of mediating savings  and  investment (and  consumption)  in \nthe real economy. \n\nIn a similar vein, threats to financial stability are considered to pose systemic risks. The \nCommittee on Global Financial Stability (CGFS 2010:2) defines systemic risk as \u201ca risk \nof disruption to financial services that is caused by an impairment of all or parts of the \nfinancial system and has the potential to have serious negative consequences for the \nreal economy.\u201d \n\nBorio  (2011)  classifies  financial  system  risk  into  two  dimensions\u2014time  and  cross-\nsectional.  The  first  involves  dealing  with  how  aggregate  risk  in  the  financial  system \nevolves over time. This is known as the tendency toward procyclicality of the financial \nsystem as a result of positive feedback between the economy and the financial system, \nthe  so-called  macro-financial  channel.  These  feedback  loops  can  emerge  from  a \nnumber of different channels, including the following: \n\n(i)  Bank capital/lending. A decline in bank capital forces it to cut back on lending, \nbut  in  the  aggregate  this  can  negatively  affect  the  economy,  leading  to  further \nlosses of capital, etc. \n\n(ii)  Asset  value/bank  lending.  A  decline  in  values  of  assets  such  as  real  estate \nused for  collateral means  banks  can  lend  less, but  reduced  bank  lending may \ncause asset values to fall further, etc. \n\n(iii) Exchange  rate/balance  sheet \n\ninteractions  (currency  mismatches).  A \ndecline in the exchange rate leads to a deterioration of net assets if firms have \nborrowed  in  foreign  currencies,  but  such  deterioration  can  weaken  economic \ngrowth, leading to further currency depreciation, etc. \n\n(iv) Liquidity\u2014interbank  and  other  money  markets  (maturity  mismatches). \nLoss of confidence in the banking sector can lead to \u201cruns\u201d on deposits or other \nshort-term financing, further decreasing confidence, etc. \n\n(v)  Leverage.  Weak  economic  growth  may  lead  to  capital  losses  that  increase \nleverage, leading to reduced bank lending and further economic weakness, etc. \n(vi) Interest rate/credit risk. Rising interest rates may reduce the ability of firms to \nrepay  debt,  leading  to  higher  risk  premiums  reflected  in  higher  interest  rates, \netc. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nThe  cross-sectional  dimension  involves  dealing  with  how  risk  is  allocated  within  the \nfinancial system at a point in time as a result of common exposures and interlinkages in \nthe financial system. These linkages may include: \n\n(i)  common  exposures  to  similar  asset  classes,  such  as  mortgage  loans  or \n\nsecuritized financial products; \n\n(ii)  indirect exposures through counterparty risks; \n\n(iii) ownership structure; \n\n(iv) exposure to systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs); \n\n(v)  infrastructure-based  risks  that  may  arise  in  payment  or  settlement  systems, \n\nsuch as centralized clearing parties; and \n\n(vi) the level of financial development. \n\n2.2  Financial Inclusion \n\nFinancial  inclusion  is  more  straightforward  to  define  and  recognize.  Lower-income \ncountries tend to see a large portion of their population and firms not having access to \nformal financial services for a number of reasons, including: limited branch networks of \nbanks  and  other  financial  institutions;  limited  availability  of  automatic  teller  machines \n(ATMs);  the  relatively  high  costs  of  servicing  small  deposits  and  loans;  limitations  on \nsatisfactory  personal  identification;  and  limitations  on  collaterizable  assets  and  credit \ninformation. Two definitions are: \n\n\u201cFinancial inclusion aims at drawing the \u201cunbanked\u201d population into the formal financial \nsystem  so  that  they  have  the  opportunity  to  access  financial  services  ranging  from \nsavings, payments, and transfers to credit and insurance.\u201d (Hannig and Jansen 2010) \n\n\u201c\u2026 the process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit \nwhere needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low income groups \nat  an  affordable  cost.  It  primarily  represents  access  to  a  bank  account  backed  by \ndeposit insurance, access to affordable credit and the payments system.\u201d (Khan 2011) \n\nFinancial  inclusion  is  most  commonly  thought  of  in  terms  of  access  to  credit  from  a \nformal  financial  institution,  but  the  concept  has  more  dimensions.  Formal  accounts \ninclude both loans and deposits, and can be considered from the point of view of their \nfrequency of use, mode of access, and the purposes of the accounts. There may also \nbe alternatives to formal accounts, such as mobile money via mobile telephones. The \nmain  other  financial  service  besides  banking  is  insurance,  especially  for  health  and \nagriculture (Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper 2012). \n\n2.3  Interactions between Financial Inclusion and Financial \n\nStability \n\nIn  this  paper  we  focus  on  the  train  of  causality  from  financial  inclusion  to  financial \nstability.  In  other  words,  does  an  increase  in  financial  inclusion  tend  to  enhance  or \nworsen financial stability? This is because scholars have suggested both positive and \nnegative ways that rising financial inclusion could affect financial stability. Alternatively, \none  could  ask  if  an  increase  in  financial  stability  leads  to  an  increase  in  financial \ninclusion.  However,  this  direction  seems  less  interesting,  as  it  seems  unlikely  that  an \nincrease in financial stability would lead to a decrease in financial inclusion.  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nKhan  (2011)  suggests  three  main  ways  in  which  greater  financial  inclusion  can \ncontribute positively to financial stability. First, greater diversification of bank assets as \na  result  of  increased  lending  to  smaller  firms  could  reduce  the  overall  riskiness  of  a \nbank\u2019s loan portfolio. This would both reduce the relative size of any single borrower in \nthe overall portfolio and reduce its volatility. According to the scheme described in the \nprevious  section,  this  would  reduce  the  \u201cinter-connectedness\u201d  risks  of  the  financial \nsystem.  Second,  increasing  the  number  of  small  savers  would  increase  both  the  size \nand stability of the deposit base, reducing banks\u2019 dependence on \u201cnon-core\u201d financing, \nwhich  tends  to  be  more  volatile  during  a  crisis.  This  corresponds  to  a  reduction  of \nprocyclicality  risk.  Third,  greater  financial  inclusion  could  also  contribute  to  a  better \ntransmission of monetary policy, also contributing to greater financial stability. \n\nHannig  and  Jansen  (2010)  argue  that  low-income  groups  are  relatively  immune  to \neconomic  cycles,  so  that  including  them  in  the  financial  sector  will  tend  to  raise  the \nstability  of  the  deposit  and  loan  bases.  They  note  anecdotal  evidence  that  suggests \nthat  financial  institutions  catering  to  the  lower  end  tend  to  weather  macro-crises  well \nand  help  sustain  local  economic  activity.  Prasad  (2010)  also  observes  that  lack  of \nadequate  access  to  credit  for  small  and  medium-size  enterprises  and  small-scale \nentrepreneurs  has  adverse  effects  on  overall  employment  growth  since  these \nenterprises tend to be much more labor intensive in their operations. \n\nKhan  (2011)  also  cites a  number of  ways  in  which  increased financial  inclusion  could \ncontribute negatively to financial stability. The most obvious example is if an attempt to \nexpand  the  pool  of  borrowers  results  in  a  reduction  in  lending  standards.  This  was  a \nmajor contributor to the severity of the \u201csub-prime\u201d crisis in the United States. Second, \nbanks could increase their reputational risk if they outsource various functions such as \ncredit  assessment  in  order  to  reach  smaller  borrowers.  Finally,  if  microfinance \ninstitutions  (MFIs)  are  not  properly  regulated,  an  increase  in  lending  by  that  group \ncould  dilute  the  overall  effectiveness  of  regulation  in  the  economy  and  increase \nfinancial system risks. \n\n3.  DATA ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND FINANCIAL \n\nSTABILITY \n\nThe  single  most  important  cross-country  database  in  this  area  is  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nGlobal  Financial  Development  database  (GFDD). 1  It  includes  a  large  number  of \nvariables  related  to  financial  inclusion,  together  with  macroeconomic  variables  and \nsome  variables  related  to  financial  development  and  financial  stability.  The  database \ncovers  164  economies,  and  has  data  series  for  as  long  as  52  years  (since  1960), \nalthough  the  time  series  for  the  variables  of  greatest  interest  are  much  shorter. \nExamples  of  variables  related  to  financial  inclusion  include  the  number  of  bank \nbranches  per  100,000  people,  the  number  of  bank  accounts  per  1,000  people,  the \npercentage  of  firms  with  a  line  of  credit  to  total  firms,  the  percentage  of  adults  either \nsaving at or borrowing from a financial institution in the past year, and the percentage \nof adults with at least one account at a formal financial institution. The GFDD includes \nextensive  survey  data  on  financial  access  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Global  Financial \nInclusion Database (Global Findex), which provides statistics on financial inclusion for \n\n                                                \n1 The GFDD database is available at: \n\nhttp://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTGLOBALFINREPORT/0,,contentMDK:23\n269602~pagePK:64168182~piPK:64168060~theSitePK:8816097,00.html. A description of the database \ncan be found in Chapter 1 of World Bank (2013) and also in Cih\u00e1k et al. (2012).  \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\n148 economies, including indicators on how people save, borrow, make payments, and \nmanage risk.2  \n\nIn the GFDD, data on the number of bank branches are typically available for about 8 \nyears  (2004\u20132011),  but  many  economies  have  some  missing  data.  Data  from  the \nGlobal Findex database, however, are available only for 2011, including the percent of \nadults  with  at  least  one  account  (or  loan)  at  a  formal  financial  institution,  which  is \narguably the single best measure of inclusion, at least for households. This means that \nthis variable can be used only in cross-section analysis, not panel data, which severely \nlimits  the  number  of  potential  observations  that  can  be  used.  The  situation  is  only \nmarginally  better for  data  on the  percentage  of firms  having  a  line  of  credit, for  either \ntotal  firms  or  SMEs.  In  this  case,  economies  for  which  data  are  available  generally \nshow one or two observations, but again, many economies have no values. Thus, data \navailability  for  financial  inclusion  variables  is  a  major  problem  that  confronts \nresearchers in this area. \n\nExamples of data on financial stability in the GFDD include bank Z-scores (an indicator \nof  the  probability  of  default  of  the  country\u2019s  banking  system),  the  ratio  of  non-\nperforming  loans  (NPLs),  the  ratio  of  bank  credit  to  bank  deposits,  the  ratio  of  bank \nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets, and the ratio of bank liquid assets to deposits \nand short-term funding. Data on these items typically are available for at least 10 years, \nand  in  some  cases  considerably  longer,  although,  again,  there  are  many  gaps  in \ncountry  coverage.  Therefore  scarcity  of  data  related  to  financial  stability  is  less  of  an \nissue than for data related to financial inclusion. \n\nThe  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  (IMF)  Financial  Access  Survey  (FAS)  provides \nadditional  useful  data,  including  inclusion  data  for  non-bank  financial  institutions  such \nas  credit  unions,  insurance  companies,  and  MFIs,  as  well  as  the  availability  of  ATMs \nand  the  amount  of  commercial  bank  loans  and  deposits  to  SMEs. 3  Since  it  also \nincludes  total  commercial  loans  and  deposits,  the  data  can  be  used  to  calculate  the \nshare of SMEs in total commercial bank loans and deposits, an important measure of \ninclusion.  The  database covers  193  economies  and  has time  series for  up  to  9  years \n(2004\u20132012),  although  again  there  are  many  missing  values,  so  the  effective  size  of \nthe database is much smaller.  \n\nAdditional measures of financial stability include the identification of periods of financial \ncrises. Reinhart and Rogoff (2009, 2010) compiled an exhaustive global list of periods \nof  financial  crises  of  various  types  dating  back  to  1800.  Another  database  by  Laeven \nand Valencia (2008) identifies 124 systemic banking crises over the period 1970\u20132007. \nHowever, Laeven and Valencia (2008) only identify the year associated with the onset \nof  a  banking  crisis,  while  Reinhart  and  Rogoff  (2009)  identify  the  entire  period  of  a \ncrisis, so the latter database is more useful for quantifying the severity of a crisis. \n\n4.  STYLIZED FACTS OF FINANCIAL STABILITY AND \n\nFINANCIAL INCLUSION \n\nThis section provides some simple comparisons of the relationship between measures \nof  financial  inclusion  and  financial  stability  obtained  from  the  databases  described  in \n                                                \n2 The Global Findex database is available at:  \n\nhttp://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/variableselection/selectvariables.aspx?source=global-findex-\n(global-financial-inclusion-database).

The first point is that financial inclusion increases along with per \ncapita GDP (Figure 1). The chart indicates that financial access tends to be less than \n20%  when  per  capita  income  is  below  $1,000,  and  exceeds  80%  when  per  capita \nincome exceeds $30,000. \n\nFigure 1: Share of Adults with an Account at One or More Formal Financial \nInstitution versus per Capita GDP \n\n0\n\n5\n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nLog of GDP per capita \n\nSource: World Bank Global Financial Inclusion Database (2012), 2011 data. \n\nHowever,  there  is  little  correlation  between  adult  access  to  formal  financial  accounts \nand  financial  stability  measures.  For  example,  Figure  2  shows  that  the  plot  of  NPLs \nversus the share of adults with an account at at least one formal financial institution is \nvirtually  flat.  The  chart  for  banks\u2019  Z-scores  versus  adult  account  access  looks  very \nsimilar. \n\nFigure 2: Share of Adults with an Account at One or More Formal Financial \nInstitution versus Bank NPLs \n\n100\n\n80\n\n \n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nt\ni\nt\ns\nn\n\ni\n \nl\n\na\n\ni\n\nc\nn\na\nn\ni\nf\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n \nl\n\na\nm\nr\no\nf\n \nt\na\n \nt\nn\nu\no\nc\nc\na\nh\nt\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nw\ns\nt\nl\nu\nd\na\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n \nl\na\nt\no\nt\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n \n,\ns\nL\nP\nN\n\n \n \nk\nn\na\nB\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nAdults with account at formal financial institution, % of \ntotal \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, NPL = non-performing loan. \n\nSource: World Bank Global Financial Inclusion Database (2012), 2011 data. \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nResults  are  somewhat  more  promising  when  looking  at  firms\u2019  access  to  financing. \nFigure  3  shows  that  there  is  some  correlation  between  the  share  of  SMEs  obtaining \nfinance  and  bank  NPLs.  The  downward  sloping  line  implies  that  increasing  access  of \nSMEs  to  finance  tends  to  reduce  the  share  of  bank  NPLs,  which  is  in  line  with  the \npositive factor identified in Section 3. However, the number of data points is small and \nthe degree of dispersion is fairly wide, so these results have to be taken with caution. \n\nFigure 3: Bank NPLs and the Share of SMEs in Total Commercial Bank Loans \n\n \nl\n\na\nt\no\nt\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n \n,\n\ns\nL\nP\nN\nk\nn\na\nB\n\n \n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nSME outstanding loans, % of total \n\n \n\nNPL = non-performing loan, SME = small and medium-sized enterprise. \n\nSource: IMF Global Financial Access Survey (2013), 2001\u20132011 average. \n\nIn  summary,  the  link  between  per  capita  income  and financial  inclusion  is fairly  clear, \nbut  the  link  between  financial  inclusion  and  financial  stability  is  less  clear.  Section  6 \npresents  our  analytical  model  and  econometric  results  for  some  measures  of  this \nrelationship.  \n\n5.  SURVEY OF EARLIER STUDIES \n\nAs mentioned above, empirical work in this area is scarce. In a study of Chilean banks, \nAdasme,  Majnoni,  and  Uribe  (2006)  found  that  the  NPLs  of  small  firms  have  quasi-\nnormal  loss  distributions,  while  those  of  large  firms  have  fat-tailed  distributions.  They \nnote that the quasi-normality of small loans\u2019 loss curves means that the occurrence of \nlarge and infrequent losses is a major concern, and therefore lending processes to this \nclass can be greatly simplified. This implies that the systemic risk of the former group is \nless  than  that  of  the  latter,  so  increased  loans  to  SMEs  should  reduce  the  overall \nriskiness of banks\u2019 lending portfolios, i.e., it should be positive for financial stability, in \nline with our preliminary finding in the previous section.  \n\nHan  and  Melecky  (2013)  analyzed  the  World  Bank  data  described  above.  They \nhypothesized that a greater share of people with bank deposits would increase banks\u2019 \nshares of stable funding (deposits), and tend to reduce volatility of total bank deposits \nduring  economic  downturns,  thereby  contributing  to  financial  stability  by  reducing  the \nprocyclical  effect  of  economic  downturns  on  bank  liquidity.  Their  dependent  variable \nwas  the  maximum  drop  in  bank  deposit  growth  between  2006  and  2010.  For \nindependent  variables,  they  used  two  different  measures  of  financial  inclusion\u2014an \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nindex  of  Honohan  (2008)  measuring  access  to  bank  deposits  before  the  2008  crisis \nperiod and the Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper (2012) measure of the share of people that \nwere  using  banking  deposits  in  2011,  cited  previously,  plus  a  number  of  control \nvariables. They found that a 10% increase in the share of people that have access to \nbank deposits can reduce the deposit growth drops (or deposit withdrawal rates) by 3\u2013\n8  percentage  points,  which  supports  the  case  that  financial  inclusion  is  positive  for \nfinancial stability. \n\n6.  MODEL, DATA, AND RESULTS \n\nTo formally verify the link between financial stability and financial inclusion, we estimate \nthe following dynamic-panel equation: \n\n \n\nfinstabi,t  = \u03b1(fininclusioni,t )+ \u03b2Xi,t + \u03b5i,t ,  \n\n \n\n \n\n(1) \n\nwhere  finstabi,t  is  the  measure  of  financial  stability;  fininclusioni,t  is  the  measure  of \nfinancial inclusion; X is a vector of controls (logarithm of GDP per capita [lgdpi,t], private \ncredit  by  deposit  money  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  to  GDP  [cgdpi,t],  liquid \nassets to deposits and short-term funding [liqi,t], non-FDI capital flow to GDP [nfdii,t] and \nfinancial openness [opnsi,t]); \u03b2 are a set of nuisance parameters; \u03b5i,t is an error term; i = \n1,  \u2026,  N  represents  the  country;  and  t  =  1,  \u2026,  T  represents  time.  Finally,  \u03b1  is  the \ncoefficient of interest to us, which measures the effect of financial inclusion on financial \nstability.   \n\nTo estimate equation (1), this study employs panel data for the period 2005\u20132011, the \nperiod  for  which  data  on  the  two  measures  of  financial  inclusion  employed  in  this \nsection are made available from the World Bank\u2019s GFDD and the IMF\u2019s FAS. The two \nmeasures  of  financial  inclusion  used  in  the  analysis  are  SME  outstanding  loans  as  a \nproportion of total outstanding loans of commercial banks (smeli,t), and the number of \nSME  borrowers  as  a  proportion  of  the  total  number  of  borrowers  from  commercial \nbanks  (sembi,t).  We  also  used  two  measures  of  financial  stability  in  the  regressions, \nnamely,  bank  Z-score  (bzsi,t)  (defined  as  the  sum  of  capital  to  assets  and  return  on \nassets  divided  by  the  standard  deviation  of  return  on  assets)  and    bank  NPLs  as  a \nproportion of gross loans by banks (npli,t). Both measures of financial stability were also \nobtained from the GFDD. The data on GDP per capita and the capital flow data used to \ngenerate the ratio of non-FDI capital flow to GDP were obtained from the World Bank\u2019s \nWorld  Development  Indicators  database.  The  data  used  to  generate  the  financial \nopenness  variable  were  obtained  from  the  Lane  and  Milesi-Ferretti  (2007)  foreign \nassets  and  foreign  liabilities  database.  Finally,  the  ratio  of  private  credit  by  deposit \nmoney  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  to  GDP  and  the  ratio  of  liquid  assets  to \ndeposits and short-term funding were obtained from the GFDD. \n\nTables 1 and 2 report the descriptive statistics and the correlations, respectively, of the \nvariables used in the empirical analysis that follows. One important caveat from Table 1 \nis  that,  while  most  of  the  variables  have  at  least  1,000  available  observations,  the \nnumber  of  available  observations  for  the  two  measures  of  financial  inclusion  is  quite \nproblematic,  with  smeli,t  and  sembi,t  having  only  266  and  161  available  observations, \nrespectively.  The  correlations  in  Table  2  are  quite  low,  particularly  those  among  the \nright-hand  side  variables,  which  suggests  that  multicollinearity  is  not  likely  to  be  an \nissue in our empirical analysis.    \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics \n\nVariable \n\nStd Dev \n\nObs \n\n1888 \n\n1034 \n\n266 \n\n161 \n\n1975 \n\n1820 \n\n1809 \n\n1141 \n\n1975 \n\nMean \n\n15.08 \n\n6.67 \n\n0.27 \n\n0.17 \n\n8.72 \n\n49.88 \n\n38.75 \n\n6.37 \n\nMin \n\n-6.17 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n5.47 \n\n0.55 \n\n0.32 \n\n-137.92 \n\n9.98 \n\n7.20 \n\n0.20 \n\n0.27 \n\n1.30 \n\n50.07 \n\n20.71 \n\n27.28 \n\nMax \n\n70.51 \n\n74.10 \n\n0.85 \n\n0.96 \n\n11.39 \n\n434.09 \n\n146.23 \n\n314.08 \n\n381.60 \n\n1612.61 \n\n27.20  24143.10 \n\nbzs \n\nnpl \n\nsmel \n\nsemb \n\nlgdp \n\ncgdp \n\nliq \n\nnfdi \n\nopns \n\nbzs \n\n1 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\nTable 2: Correlations of the Variables \n\nVariable \n\nnpl \n\nsmel \n\nsemb \n\nlgdp \n\ncgdp \n\nliq \n\nnfdi \n\nopns \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1 \n\nbzs \n\nnpl \n\nsmel \n\nsemb \n\nlgdp \n\ncgdp \n\nliq \n\nnfdi \n\n0.2846 \n\n \n1 \n\n0.042 \n\n0.6784 \n\n \n\n \n1 \n\n-0.0807  0.1081 \n\n-0.1113 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1 \n\n0.0923 \n\n-0.1351 \n\n-0.0708 \n\n0.0193 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1 \n\n-0.375 \n\n0.2112 \n\n0.3305 \n\n0.1689 \n\n0.3389 \n\n0.4688 \n\n-0.0626 \n\n0.1827 \n\n-0.1593  0.1707 \n\n-0.207 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1 \n\n-0.1117 \n\n-0.1634 \n\n-0.3901 \n\n-0.1541 \n\n-0.1867  0.2191 \n\n-0.2629 \n\nopns \n\n-0.1793 \n\n-0.2067 \n\n-0.0934 \n\n-0.1408  0.7219 \n\n0.4878 \n\n0.1164  0.0994 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\nWe  estimate  equation  (1)  above  using  the  system-GMM  dynamic  panel  estimator  of \nBlundell  and  Bond  (1998).  System-GMM  is  based  on  a  system  composed  of  first-\ndifferences  instrumented  on  lagged  levels,  and  of  levels  instrumented  on  lagged first-\ndifferences.  In  addition  to  providing  a  rigorous  remedy  for  endogeneity  bias,  dynamic \npanel  GMM  estimation  holds  two  further  attractions.  First,  it  is  more  robust  to \nmeasurement  error  than  cross-sectional  regressions.  Second,  dynamic  panel  GMM \nremains consistent even if the explanatory variables are endogenous in the sense that \nE[Xt\u03b5s] \u2260 0 for s \u2264 t, if the instrumental variables are sufficiently lagged.      \n\nWe employ the two-step estimator, and correct the standard errors of the two-step \nestimator for small-sample bias by applying the correction suggested by Windmeijier \n(2005). The maximum number of lags of the instrument sets is constrained in some \nspecifications to avoid over-fitting. We report Hansen tests to test for over-identifying \nrestrictions (Blundell and Bond 1998).

In  column  (3),  we  obtain  a  consistent  finding,  in  which \nsmeli,t  enters  negatively,  that  is,  greater  lending  to  SMEs  leads  to  lower  bank  NPLs \n(npli,t),  though  this  result  is  only  weakly  significant  at  the  10%  significance  level.  The \nresults  on  the  effect  of  financial  inclusion  on  financial  stability  using  our  second \nmeasure of financial inclusion (sembi,t) are reported in columns (2) and (4) of Table 3. \nIn column (2), we find sembi,t to be positive and significant, that is, a greater number of \nSME borrowers leads to a lower probability of default by financial institutions. In column \n(4),  we  find  sembi,t  to  be  negative  and  significant,  that  is,  a  greater  number  of  SME \nborrowers leads to lower bank NPLs.  \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nIn terms of our conditioning variables, we obtain the following results. In three (columns \n[1]\u2013[3])  of  our  four  regressions,  income  as  measured  by  lgdpi,t  significantly  affects \nfinancial stability, that is, high-income countries are less prone to financial instability. In \nline with the previous literature (e.g., Drehmann et al [2011]; Gourinchas and Obstfeld \n[2012];  Drehmann  and  Juselius  [2013]),  we  also  find  in  three  (columns  [1]\u2013[3])  of  our \nfour  regressions  that  higher  private  sector  credit  relative  to  GDP  (cgdpi,t)  leads  to  a \nhigher likelihood of financial instability. Following on from Han and Melecky (2013), in \ntwo (columns [1] and [2]) of our four regressions, we find that greater liquidity by banks \n(liqi,t)  leads  to  greater  financial  stability  via  a  lower  probability  of  default  by  financial \ninstitutions. At the same time, though, we also obtain evidence that greater liquidity by \nbanks  (liqi,t)  leads  to  higher  bank  NPLs  (column  3).  In  line  with  the  previous  result \nobtained by Calderon and Serven (2011), in three of the four GMM regressions, we find \nthat the ratio of non-FDI capital flows to GDP (nfdii,t) does not have a significant effect \non  financial  stability,  whereas,  in  one  of  the  regressions  we  find  a  counter-intuitive \nresult  that  short-term  capital  flows  lead  to  lower  bank  NPLs.  Finally,  in  line  with  the \nresult  obtained  by  Frankel  and  Saravelos  (2012),  we  find  in  only  one  (though  it  was \nweakly significant) of the four regressions that financial openness (opnsi,t) can lead to \ngreater financial stability. \n\nThe standard diagnostic tests of the four regressions presented in Table 3 suggest no \nmisspecification  problems,  with  the  AR2  test failing to reject the  null  hypothesis  of  no \nsecond-order  residual  autocorrelation,  while  the  Hansen  test  for  over-identifying \nrestrictions also fails to reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are valid.4           \n\n7.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nThis  paper  has  examined  the  relationship  between  financial  stability  and  financial \ninclusion  to  examine  whether  they  are  mutually  reinforcing,  or  whether  there  are \nsubstantial  trade-offs  between  them.  The  literature  suggests  that  greater  financial \ninclusion  could  be  either  positive  or  negative  for  financial  stability.  Positive  effects \ninclude:  diversification  of  bank  assets,  thereby  reducing  their  riskiness;  increased \nstability  of  their  deposit  base,  reducing  liquidity  risks;  and  improved  transmission  of \nmonetary  policy.  Negative  effects  include  the  erosion  of  credit  standards  (e.g.,  sub-\nprime), bank reputational risk, and inadequate regulation of MFIs. \n\nFinancial  inclusion  data  are  problematic  because  of  their  short  time  span  and  limited \navailability.  Some  variables  only  have  1  year  of  observation,  and  others  only  2. \nHowever,  working  with  panel  data,  in  spite  of  the  relatively  small  size,  we  are  able  to \ncontrol for the more serious issue of endogeneity through the use of the system-GMM \ndynamic panel estimator. \n\nPrevious studies tended to find positive effects of greater financial inclusion on financial \nstability,  i.e.,  that  the  two  are  complementary  rather  than  there  being  a  trade-off \nbetween  them.  Our  estimation  work  also  supports  this.  Specifically,  we  find  evidence \nthat an increased share of lending to SMEs in total bank lending aids financial stability, \nmainly by a reduction of NPLs and a lower probability of default by financial institutions. \nThis  suggests  that  policy  measures  to  increase  financial  inclusion,  at  least  by  SMEs, \nwould  have  the  side  benefit  of  contributing  to  financial  stability  as  well.  We  also  find \nthat  higher  per  capita GDP  tends to  increase financial  stability,  while  a  higher ratio  of \n\n                                                \n4 Though the p-value of 1.0 of the Hansen test in column (2) suggests over-fitting, this is probably due to \n\nthe relatively small sample size in our regressions.  \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nprivate bank credit to GDP reduces financial stability. These results are consistent for \nboth measures of financial stability used in the study. \n\nFuture work could consider the effects of measures of household inclusion, such as the \npercentage of adults with deposits or loans at a formal financial institution, on financial \nstability  measures. We  could  also  examine  other  measures  of  financial  stability,  such \nas the volatility of GDP growth, bank loans, bank deposits, or the presence of financial \ncrises. \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\f        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    Morgan and Pontines \n\nADBI Working Paper 488 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAdasme, O., G.

This  raises  the  question  of  whether  financial  stability \nand  financial  inclusion  are,  broadly  speaking,  substitutes  or  complements.  In  other  words, \ndoes  the  move  toward  greater  financial  inclusion  tend  to  increase  or  decrease  financial \nstability?  A  number  of  studies  have  suggested  both  positive  and  negative  ways  in  which \nfinancial  inclusion  could  affect  financial  stability,  but  very  few  empirical  studies  have  been \nmade  of  their  relationship. This  partly  reflects the  scarcity  and  relative  newness  of  data  on \nfinancial  inclusion.  This  study  contributes  to  the  literature  on  this  subject  by  estimating  the \neffects  of  various  measures  of financial  inclusion  (together  with  some  control  variables)  on \nsome  measures  of  financial  stability,  including  bank  non-performing  loans  and  bank \nZ-scores.  We  find  some  evidence  that  an  increased  share  of  lending  to  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) aids financial stability, mainly by reducing non-performing \nloans (NPLs) and the probability of default by financial institutions. This suggests that policy \nmeasures  to  increase  financial  inclusion,  at  least  by  SMEs,  would  have  the  side-benefit  of \ncontributing to financial stability as well. \n", " \n", "JEL Codes: G21, G28, O16 \n \n \n \n", " \n"]}
