INTRODUCTION \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nGiven  the  relationship  between  inequality  and  growth  (Lewis  1955;  Kuznets  1955; \nWilliamson  1965;  Huw  and  Bernhardt  2000)  and  the  well-recognized  link  between \ngrowth  and  structural  change  (Laitner  1999;  Echevarria  1997;  Fan,  Zhang,  and \nRobinson 2003), it is natural to ask if and how structural transformation affects income \ndistribution.  The  special  significance  of  exploring  the  structural  change\u2013inequality \nnexus  lies  in  that  structural  transformation  is  almost  indispensable  to  long-run \neconomic  growth  in  both  developing  and  developed  economies.  Therefore,  inequality \nchanges  that  are  attributable  to  structural  transformation,  if  existent,  form  part  of  \nthe  growth  regularity  and  are  inevitable.  On  the  other  hand,  structural  transformation  \nis  a  transitional  process.  Consequently,  any  inequality  change  associated  with \nstructural  transformation  is  expected  to  disappear  once  the  latter  is  complete.  It  \nfollows that policy interventions to contain or curb this component of inequality changes \nare unnecessary. \n\nDespite  its  theoretical  and  empirical  significance,  little  research  attention  has  been \nfocused  on  the  inequality\u2013structural  change  nexus,  although  there  are  many  studies  \non  income  distribution  or  structural  transformation  separately.  For  the  case  of  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  see  Wan  (2008a,  2008b)  and  Wang,  Wan,  and \nYang (2014) on income distribution and Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2011) on structural \ntransformation.  The  classic  works  of  Kuznets  (1955)  and  Lewis  (1955)  focus  on  the \nrelationship  between  growth  (not  structural  change  per  se)  and  inequality,  which  is \nlargely  applicable  to  developing  economies  only.  Structural  change,  however,  is  a \ncommon feature of all economies. \n\nThis  paper  contributes  to  the  literature  by  developing  a  general  equilibrium  model, \ndemonstrating  a  relationship  of  inverted  U  shape  between  inequality  and  structural \nchange.  Decomposition  frameworks  are  then  derived  that  can  be  used  to  identify \n(i) sectoral contributions to total inequality and (ii) the changes in inequality attributable \nto  structural  transformation  (the  structural  component)  and  to  concentration  or  spatial \nagglomeration  (the  concentration  component).  Finally,  we  apply  the  decomposition \nframeworks to data from the PRC. \n\nThe  PRC  offers  an  excellent  opportunity  for  investigating  the  structural  change\u2013\ninequality  nexus.  Policy  shocks  initiated  in  late  1978  and  a  series  of  reforms \nimplemented in the following years led to significant structural transformation, meaning \nlarge-scale resource flows across locations and sectors. In particular, the huge number \nof rural-to-urban migrants in the PRC, now estimated in the order of 270 million, would \nhave been unemployed or underemployed in the absence of such structural changes. \nHolding  everything  else  constant,  such  structural  transformation  is  expected  to  help \nreduce inequality, as those migrants who were most likely to be under- or unemployed \nnow  earn  decent  income.  Of  course,  in  reality  little  can  be  held  constant.  In  fact, \ninequality in the PRC has risen rapidly, leading to serious and multiple socioeconomic \nproblems.  Clearly,  identifying  and  quantifying  the  impacts  of  structural  change  on \ninequality  will  help  provide  valuable  policy  implications  for  the  PRC  government  and \npossibly other institutions. \n\nIn  addition  to  confirming  the  relationship  of  inverted  U  shape  predicted  by  our \ntheoretical  model,  other  major  empirical  findings  of  this  paper  include:  (i) Regional \ninequality in pre-reform PRC was broadly trendless while a rising trend emerged after \nreforms \ntransformation  was  \nthe  main  driver  of  regional  inequality  before  2004  but  spatial  concentration  or \nagglomeration  became  the  dominant  component  after  2006.  (iii)  The  structural  and \n\n(ii)  Structural \n\nthat  began \n\nlate  1978. \n\nin \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nconcentration  components  tended  to  reinforce  each  other  until  1972  and  offset  each \nother  during  1973\u20131985.  They  seem  uncorrelated  in  other  years.  (iv)  The  agriculture \nsector  had  been  always  inequality-reducing  while  the  service  sector  almost  always  \ndis-equalizing. The manufacturing sector accounted for more than half of total regional \ninequality before the mid-1990s, but this role was taken over by the service sector after \nthe  mid-2000s.  (v)  The  service  industry  has  been  spatially  diverging  since  the  early \n1980s.  By  the  mid-2000s,  it  overtook  the  secondary  industry  as  the  most  important \ncontributor  to  regional  inequality.  From  1994  to  2003,  all  increases  in  total  regional \ninequality came from the tertiary sector. \n\nBefore  proceeding  further,  it  is  useful  to  mention  the  study  by  Caselli  and  Coleman \n(2001),  which  may  appear  to  be  closely  related  to  this  study.  However,  our  paper \ndiffers from theirs in several aspects: (i) We consider only one economy, and model the \nentire process of inequality evolution due to structural change caused by technological \nor other shocks, while they consider multiple regional economies of the United States \n(US)  and  focus  on  income  convergence  (not  the  entire  process  of  inequality  change) \ndriven by reductions in education cost. (ii) We focus on divergence and convergence in \ninter-sector  gaps  while  they  focus  on  convergence  in  total  income  across  regions. \nThus,  the  steady  state  or  completion  of  structural  transformation  in  our  paper  implies \ndisappearance  of  inter-sector gaps,  not  necessarily  convergence  in  total  income.  The \nsteady state in their papers means disappearance of gaps in total income, inter-sector \nincome,  and  economic  structure  across  regions.  (iii)  As  far  as  empirical  application  is \nconcerned,  we  account  for  the  level  as  well  as  changes  in  regional  inequality  in  the \nPRC,  while  they  explain  the  declining  gaps  in  income  level  and  economic  structure \nacross regions in the US.  \n\nThe  plan  of  our  paper  is  as  follows.  Section  2  presents  graphical  illustrations  and  a \ntheoretical  model  demonstrating  how \ntechnology  shocks  cause  structural  \nchange  that,  in  turn,  induces  an  inverted  U  shape  of  inequality.  Section  3  proposes \ndecomposition  techniques  for  identifying  and  measuring  sector  contributions  to  total \ninequality  and  the  contribution  of  structural  transformation  to  a  change  in  inequality, \nwhere inequality is indicated by the popular Gini coefficient. In Section 4, the proposed \ndecomposition techniques are applied to provincial gross domestic product (GDP) data \nfrom  the  PRC,  confirming  the  inverted  U  shape  and  providing  several  fresh  and \ninsightful empirical findings. Section 5 concludes. \n\n2.  THE STRUCTURAL CHANGE\u2013INEQUALITY NEXUS \n\nStructural change can occur in any economy at any stage of its development. Broadly \nspeaking,  it  often  refers  to  the  process  of  industrialization  or  rising  dominance  of  the \nservice sector. But structural transformation can and increasingly does take place at a \nmore  disaggregated  level  of  industry  classification.  For  example,  the  information \ntechnology  shock  not  only  led  to  the  creation  of  the  information  and  communication \ntechnology  industry  but  also  has  exerted  tremendous  impacts  on  many  other  sectors \nsuch as telecommunication and banking services. It has certainly caused disequilibria \nin  the  labor  markets  for  many  years  and  generated  significant  wage  premiums  for \ninformation and communication technology professionals in the early days. Those who \nstepped into this sector early enjoyed higher remuneration, leading to significant inter-\nsector wage gaps. As another example, the policy shocks initiated in the late 1970s of \nthe  PRC  (see  section  4  of  this  paper  for  more  discussion)  led  to  significant  structural \nchanges,  affecting  urban\u2013rural  income  disparity  and  possibly  increasing  inequalities \nwithin rural and urban areas, too. \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nBeneath  any  structural  transformation  are  the  flows  of  resources,  such  as  labor  and \ncapital, across industries and locations. For example, as nonfarming sectors boom and \nthe primary sector shrinks in the PRC, hundreds of millions of laborers have migrated \nfrom  rural  areas  to  the  cities,  from  agriculture  to  jobs  in  the  manufacturing  and  \nservice  sectors,  and  from  inland  to  coastal  regions.  Such  large-scale  migration, \nunprecedented  in  human  history,  is  largely  driven  by  disequilibria  in  factor  markets \namid  structural  transformations.  As  a  stylized  fact,  surplus  rural  labor  and  rising \ndemand  of  nonagriculture  sectors  for  low-skilled  labor  coexist  in  almost  all  emerging \neconomies, implying that both rural and urban labor markets can be in disequilibrium.  \n\nTo illustrate, assume an economy with two sectors (sectors i and j). Figure 1(a) shows \nthe  economy  at  the  initial  equilibrium  with  labor  inputs  Li*  and  Lj*,  as  determined  by \nlabor demand D and supply S, appropriately indexed. Both sectors pay the same wage \nW* and there is no inequality. \n\nFigure 1(a): Structural Change and Inequality: Initial Equilibrium \n\nSource: Authors' adaptation. \n\n \n\n \n\nNow  there  comes  a  technological,  cultural,  institutional,  or  policy  shock,  which  shifts \nlabor demand in sector i upward from Di1 to Di2 in Figure 1(b). This, in the short run, will \nlead to an increase of wage in sector i to W1, because labor supply cannot adjust to the \ndemand  change  due  to  skill  mismatch,  job  transfer  or  adjustment  costs,  and  so  on. \nWage or income inequality thus emerges. The wage difference, of course, will induce \nlabor flows from sector j to sector i, as indicated by the arrows under the horizontal axis \nin Figure 1(b).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nFigure 1(b): Structural Change and Inequality: Disequilibrium \n\nSource: Authors' adaptation. \n\n \n\nThis labor flow, likely to be a gradual process, will eventually lead to a new equilibrium, \nwith same wage W** in both sectors, as shown in Figure 1(b). Contrasting Figures 1(a) \nand  1(b),  output  and  input(s)  in  sector  i  grow  but  they  decline  in  sector  j,  implying \nstructural change. Figure 1(c) shows the entire process. \n\nFigure 1(c): Structural Change and Inequality: The Transition Process \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors' adaptation. \n\nThe above depicts a relationship of inverted U shape between inequality and structural \nchange,  holding  everything  else  constant.  At  the  onset  of  a  structural  change \n(disequilibrium),  inequality  rises  but  then  decreases  as  structural  transformation \napproaches  completion.  Of  course, \ninequality  often  persists  since  structural \ntransformation  could  last  for  a  long  time,  particularly  when  markets  are  fragmented,  \nas  in the  PRC.  It  is  useful  to reiterate  that  this  inverted  U  shape  is  applicable  to  both \nindustrialized  and  developing  economies  provided  structural  changes  of  any  kind  \ntake place. Such a pattern between inequality and structural transformation is different \nfrom,  although  related  to,  the  Kuznets  hypothesis,  which  intends  to  establish  a  \ngrowth\u2013inequality  relationship.  The  mechanism  underlying  the  Kuznets  hypothesis  \nis  also  different.  As  Lewis  (1955)  pointed  out,  growth  usually  does  not  take  place \neverywhere  and  not  everyone  is  positioned  to  gain  from  growth  at  the  same  rate.  As  \na  consequence,  growth  often  comes  with  rising  inequality.  Kuznets  (1955)  offered \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nanecdotal  evidence  on  and  discussed  why  the  growth\u2013inequality  relationship  may \nexhibit an inverted U shape.  \n\nThe  graphical  illustration  is  informative  but  unrealistic.  In  reality,  it  is  rare  to  have \ncomplete equilibrium to begin with. That is, the initial inequality is unlikely to be nil. In \naddition,  for  many  developing  economies,  the  urban\u2013rural  gap  is  typically  large  and \nsurplus  labor  exists  in  relatively  lagging  rural  areas  with  an  almost  horizontal  labor \nsupply curve. In this case, flows of labor from rural to urban sectors will help raise rural \nincome (e.g., via remittances and increased resources per unit of labor in rural areas) \nwhile keeping urban wages from rising. Even in mature economies, inter-industry wage \ngaps persist. \n\nTo formalize the structural change\u2013inequality nexus, without the unrealistic assumption \nof initial wage equality and other limitations of the graphical illustration, we begin with a \nsimple  variant  of  the  standard  two-sector  dynamic  equilibrium  model.  For  easy \nexposition, we will call these sectors a traditional and a modern sector. The economy is \npopulated by overlapping generations of two-period-lived agents. All agents only work \nfor  one  period  in  a  sector  of  their  choice.  Moving  from  one  sector  to  another  incurs \nmigration costs. \n\nProduction \n\nThe traditional sector is labor intensive and uses labor as the only input. The modern \nsector  uses  both  capital  and  labor  for  production  and  is  subject  to  shocks  such  as \ntechnological  advances  or  institutional  reforms.  The  products  of  both  sectors  can  be \neither consumed or saved for future capital formation. \n\nLet t index time, r index the traditional sector, Y denote value of output, and L denote \nlabor input.

They  make  labor  transfer  or  migration  decisions  based  on \nutility  differences  between  the  two  sectors.  By  manipulating  (2.10),  we  can  show  that \nsuch  utility  differences  are  simply  their  wage  differences.  Therefore,  labor  transfer  \nwill  occur  as  long  as\n.  As  argued  by  Harris  and  Todaro  (1970)  and  \nChau  (1997),  however,  labor  transfer  is  not  cost-free.  Nonmonetary  costs  such  as  \nloss  of  social  capital,  psychological  obstacles,  and  adaption  to  new  job  and  living \nenvironments are inevitable. In this paper, the costs of labor transfer are considered as \na reduction in the utility of agents, denoted by D. Thus, in equilibrium, we have: \n\n \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f = 1\n\nCombined (2.8) and (2.12), we can solve for the labor market equilibrium as: \n\n\u2212 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\n\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\n\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\n= \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\n\nwhere \n\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf0f\n\n.

Any  positive  shock  will  bring  in  a \ntemporary  wage  increase  to  the  relevant  sector,  leading  to  changes  in  inequality  or \nwage  gaps,  which  induce  labor  transfers.  Such  transfers  will  help  gradually  restore \nequilibriums  in  the  labor  markets  of  all  sectors.  Consequently,  the  wage  gaps  will \nnarrow  over  time.  When  the  structural  change  comes  to  completion,  its  impact  on \ninequality change disappears.  \n\n3.  ACCOUNTING FOR INEQUALITY AND ITS CHANGES: \n\nTHE ROLES OF ECONOMIC STRUCTURE AND \nSTRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION \n\nIt is important to point out that structural changes may be accompanied by changes in \ninequality  within  sectors  and  that  inequality  could  be  driven  by  forces  other  than \nstructural  transformation.  These  forces  determine  the  levels  of  inequality  before  the \nonset,  as  well  as  after  the  completion,  of  a  structural  change.  Thus,  the  structural \ntransformation\u2013inequality  relationship  is  complex  and  may  vary  over  time  and  from \neconomy  to  economy.  The  analytical  challenge  lies  in  how  to  disentangle  the \ncontribution of structural transformation to an overall change in total inequality, an issue \nto be addressed in this section. \n\nConsistent  with  the  theoretical  model  in  section  2,  inequality  will  be  measured  by  the \npopular  Gini  coefficient.  A  particular  advantage  of  the  Gini  coefficient  was  shown  by \nDagnum  (1990),  who  proved  that  the  social  welfare  function  underlying  the  Gini \ncoefficient  is  an  increasing function  of the  mean  income  and  a  decreasing function of \nincome  inequality.  In  contrast,  other  inequality  measures,  including  the  generalized \nentropy  family  and  Atkinson  measures,  generally  imply  decreases  in  social  welfare \nfollowing a drop in income of an economic unit irrespective of what might happen to the \noverall income distribution. \n\nOne way of computing the Gini coefficient is to follow Silber (1989): \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n(3.1) \n\n(3.2) \n\n(3.3) \n\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\n\nwhere Gd denotes the Gini estimate, P is a row vector containing the shares of income-\nreceiving units, and I is a column vector containing the corresponding income shares. \nBoth  are  ranked  by  increasing  values  of  per  capita  income  of  the  income-receiving \nunits. Finally, Q is a square matrix with appropriate dimensions with qij = 0 if i = j, qij = 1 \nif i < j, and qij = \u20131 if i > j. \n\nNow, suppose total income Y is composed of K sources or components, i.e., Y = Y1 + \nY2  +  ...  +  YK. When  equation  (3.1)  is  applied  to  a  particular  source  of  income  Yk,  the \ncorresponding Gini  ratio,  denoted  by  Gk,  indicates  inequality  in  the  k-th factor  income \nand can be computed using the following equation: \n\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\nwhere Pk is a row vector of shares of income-receiving units who receive Yk, and Ik is a \ncolumn vector of income shares computed using data on the k-th component income. \nBoth  are  ranked  by  increasing  values  of  per  capita  component  income  Yk  (not  per \ncapita total income Y). When the Pk and Ik vectors are ranked by increasing values of \nper capita total income Y instead of Yk, one obtains the concentration index Ck: \n\n\u2217\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n* and  Ik\n\n\u2217\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n* contain  the  same  elements  as  Pk  and  Ik  do,  but  these  elements  are \nwhere  Pk\nnow ranked by increasing values of per capita total income Y, not component income \nYk.  Thus,  Ck  =  Gk  if  and  only  if  the  ordering  of  the  total  income  and  that  of  the  k-th \ncomponent  income  are  the  same.  While  any  Gini  ratio  Gk  or  Gd  takes  value  in  the \ninterval (0, 1), Ck lies between \u2013Gk and Gk (Kakawin 1977, p. 721).  \n\nIt  is  useful  to  note  that  Ck  <  0  means  that  source  income  k  is  negatively  correlated  \nwith total income. In this case, the poor receive more Yk than the rich. And an increase \nin  the  k-th  source  income,  holding  its  distribution  unchanged,  will  help  moderate  \ntotal  inequality.  In  fact,  Ck  <  0  overstates  the  condition  for  the  k-th  income  to  be \ninequality-reducing. The k-th income is inequality-reducing as long as Ck < Gd (Podder \nand Chatterjee 2002). The contrary is true when Ck > Gd. \n\nLet u and uk  denote the mean of the total income and the mean of the k-th component \nincome, and Gd can be expressed as (Kakwani 1977: 724): \n\n  \n\n(3.4) \n\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 = \u2211 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\u2044 = \u2211 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\nwhere  Sk =  uk/u  denotes  the  share  of  the  k-th  income  in  total  income.  Thus,  the  Gini \ncoefficient can be interpreted as a weighted average of K concentration indices, using \nthe income shares as weights.  \n\nEquation  (3.4)  can  be  used  to  explore  the  composition  of  a  Gini  estimate,  providing \ninsights  on  which  income  source  deserves  more  consideration  in  the  fight  against \ninequality. It follows that SkCk/Gd represents the percentage contribution of component \nincome k to the overall income inequality. \n\nHowever, a dominant contributor in terms of inequality composition may not be a major \ncontributor  to  a  change  in  inequality.  An  analogous  case  is  the  distinction  between \nsources  of  economic  growth  and  the  composition  of  an  economy.

Equation (3.9) indicates that a change in inequality can be attributed to \ntwo  components:  (i)  changes  in the  income  shares,  i.e., \n;  and  (ii)  changes  in \n.  In  the  context  of  regional  inequality,  the \nthe  concentration  indices,  i.e., \n\u2206\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\nsecond  component  can  be  interpreted  as  the  contribution  arising  from  changes  in \nspatial  agglomeration.  Clearly,  each  of  these  two  components  can  be  further  broken \ndown into K finer components.  \n\n\u2217\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\u2211 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\n\u2217\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\u2211 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\n\u2206\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\nIt  is  important  to  point  out  that  in  reality  changes  in  the  income  shares  can  be \nindependent  of  changes  in  the  distributions  of  individual  income  components.  For \nexample,  suppose  there  was  an  increase  in  the  k-th  component  income  by  x  percent \nfor  everyone.  Clearly,  this  does  not  affect  the  inequality  of  any  component  income \nincluding  that  of  the  k-th  income  as  long  as  relative  inequality  measures  are  used. \nHowever, Sk is now greater and all other income shares will alter. If the k-th income is \nmore equally distributed than the total income, the overall inequality following such an \nincrease  should  drop,  and  vice  versa.  This  change  in  the  overall  income  inequality  is \nsolely and completely attributable to variations in the income shares.  \n\n(3.5) \n\n(3.6) \n\n (3.7) \n\n(3.8) \n\n \n\n  \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nSo far, equations (3.4)\u2013(3.9) are expressed or derived using Sk as income shares. Let \nN denote national population, since Sk = uk/u = N uk/N u and when income sources are \ncategorized by economic sectors, Sk then represents sector share in the national GDP. \nConsequently, equation (3.4) can be used to explore sector contributions to the overall \ninequality  and  equation  (3.9)  can  be  used  to  quantify  the  contributions  of  structural \ntransformation  to  inequality  changes.  As  a  consequence,  the  first  term  of  (3.9), \n, \n,  can  be  called  the  structural  effects  and  the  second  term,\nconcentration  or  agglomeration  effects.  As  previously  discussed, the structural effects \n\u2217\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n \u2211 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ncan appear even if within-sector inequalities do not change at all. \n\n\u2217\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n \u2211 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\n\u2206\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\n\u2206\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n\nIt  is  useful  to  reiterate  the  significance  of  equation  (3.9):  policy  options  to  deal  with \nstructural  effects  could  differ  fundamentally  from  those  to  deal  with  concentration  or \nagglomeration  effects.  In  most  developing  countries  such  as  the  PRC,  increases  in \ninequality  due  to  structural  transformation  (relative  decline  in  agriculture  is  commonly \nobserved  in  less  developed  countries)  are  inevitable  as  urbanization,  industrialization, \nand  service  sector  development  take  place.  In  other  words,  less  developed  countries \nand  transitional  economies  almost  certainly  have  to  experience  this  kind  of  inequality \nincreases  led  by  structural  transformation,  sooner  or  later.  Under  this  circumstance, \nany  interventions  to  curb  inequality  rise  induced  by  the  structure  change  are \ninappropriate.  On  the  other  hand,  the  structural  effects  will  diminish  and  finally \ndisappear  as  an  economy  approaches  its  completion  of  structural  adjustment,  as \npredicted  by  our  theoretical  model  of  section  2,  and  confirmed  by  the  empirical \nevidence presented in the next section. \n\n \n\n4.  STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND REGIONAL \nINEQUALITY IN CHINA: AN EMPIRICAL \nAPPLICATION \n\nSection  3  of  this  paper  proposes  a  decomposition  framework  that  can  be  used  to \nidentify  and  measure  sector  contributions  to  total  inequality  as  well  as  the  impacts  of \nstructural  transformation  on  inequality  changes.  Combining  the  theoretical  result  of \nsection  2  with  the  Kuznets  hypothesis,  three  empirical  regularities  can  be  postulated: \n(i) Sector  contributions  to  total  inequality  depend  on  their  development  status;  that  is, \nan  emerging  industry  such  as  the  tertiary  sector  in  the  PRC  is  expected  to  be \ninequality-increasing while a sunset industry such as the primary sector is predicted to \nplay an equalizing role. Manufacturing\u2019s contribution to inequality will increase first, and \nthen decrease. (ii) As far as the structural effects of inequality changes are concerned, \nthe manufacturing sector is expected to be the dominant driver, followed by the service \nsector  and  finally  the  primary  industry.  But  in  recent  years,  the  tertiary  sector  has \nbecome  the  dominant  determinant.  (iii)  The  structural  effect  is  a  quadratic  function  of \neconomic  structures\u2014the  inverted  U  shape.  In  particular,  the  structural  effect  is \nexpected to converge to zero as industrialization approaches completion in the PRC. \n\nTo  verify  these  regularities,  the  profiles  of  structural  change  and  regional  inequality  \nin  the  PRC  are  provided  in  section  4.1.  Section  4.2  explores  sector  contributions  to  \nthe  level  of  total  regional  inequality.  This  is  followed  by  section  4.3,  which  analyzes \nchanges  in  regional  inequality,  focusing  on  the  structural  effect.  Section  4.4  models  \nthe  overall  and  sector  structural  effects  to  test  the  second  and  third  regularities;  and \nfinally,  as  a  digression,  we  briefly  discuss  the  recent  declines  in  the  total  inequality \nin section 4.5. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\n4.1  Structural Transformation and Regional Inequality Profiles \n\nThe  PRC\u2019s  recent  economic  takeoff  began  with  the  official  introduction  of  the \nagricultural  production  responsibility  system  in  late  1978,  which  significantly  raised \nincomes  of  farmers.  Rural  income  growth  stimulated  demand  for  nonagricultural \ncommodities,  which  provided  the  necessary  condition  for  expanding  the  nonfarm \nsectors. By the mid-1980s, reforms were extended into cities and towns. These reforms \nplus  the  open-door  strategy  provided  sufficient  conditions  for  the  expansion  of  the \nnonfarm  sectors,  particularly  the  manufacturing  industry,  including  the  enterprises  in \ntowns  and  villages.  Industrial  growth,  in  turn,  generated  employment  opportunities  for \nsurplus labor in rural PRC, which led to further increases in the income and demand of \nrural households. The virtuous circle then sets in, reinforced by a series of reforms and \nfurther  opening-up  policies  to  take  advantage  of  the  global  market  and  foreign  direct \ninvestment. Thus, the so-called PRC miracle has emerged. \n\nAccompanying  the  PRC  miracle  is  swift  structural  transformation  (Figure  3a).  At  the \nnational  level,  the  GDP share  of  the  primary  industry  decreased from  54.6%  in  1952,  \nto 29.5% in 1977, and to 10.0% in 2012, while the corresponding share of the service \nsector  increased  from  22.6%  to  28.2%  and  further  to  46.1%.  Meanwhile,  the  GDP \nshare  of  the  secondary  industry  grew  from  22.8%  in  1952  to  50.0%  in  1977  and  has \nsince  fluctuated  between  40%  and  52%.  Looking  forward,  there  is  limited  room  for \nsignificant  declines  of  the  primary  industry,  especially  given  the  commitments  of  the \ncurrent  leadership  to  food  security  and  rural  development.  But  the  prominence  of  the \nservice sector will continue to grow at the expense of the manufacturing sector.  \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nFigure 3: Economic Structure (GDP Composition) of the PRC  \nand Representative Provinces \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nFigure 3 continued \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nFigure 3 continued \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nAt  the  subnational  level,  the  initial  state  of  economic  structure  and  the  pace  of \nstructural transformation  differed  significantly  from  province  to  province. For  example, \nin  1952  the  primary  sector  occupied  more  than  75%  of  the  provincial  economy  \nin  Anhui,  Ningxia,  and  Tibet  but  only  around  20%  in  Liaoning,  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and \nShanghai.  Figures  3b\u20133d  depict  structural  changes  of  representative  provinces. \nRepresented by Beijing and Shanghai, more developed provinces have completed the \nindustrialization  process  and  are  entering  the  service-dominant  stage  of  development \n(Figure 3b). Other provinces, as represented by Guizhou, Gansu, Yunnan, and Hainan, \nsaw  little  change  in  the  share  of  the  secondary  industry,  implying  that  these  lagging \nprovinces  are  yet to  experience  industrialization  (Figure  3c). The remaining  provinces \ndisplayed  an  increasing  trend  or  a  U-shaped  pattern  in terms  of  the  industry  share  in \nGDP,  as  represented  by  Jiangxi  and  Hubei  (Figure  3d).  The  disastrous  effects  of  the \nGreat Leap Forward (1958\u20131960) can be seen in all provinces. \n\nAs  discussed  above,  structural  changes  are  usually  associated  with  resource  flows.  \nIn  particular,  the  much-publicized  labor  migration  in  the  PRC  has  been  gaining \nmomentum  since  the  mid-1990s,  with  migration  mainly  from  agriculture  to  the \nmanufacturing  sector,  from  rural  areas  to  cities,  from  small  cities  to  large  ones,  and \nfrom  inland  areas  to  the  coast.  This  unprecedented  migration,  now  in  the  order  of  \n270  million  or  more,  must  be  driven  by  the  high  urban\u2013rural  average  income  ratio  \nand  significant  wage  gaps  across  industries  and  locations  in  the  PRC.  It  is  thus  not \nsurprising  to  witness,  amid  such  resource  flows  and  structural  transformation, \nsignificant  changes  in  income  distribution  along  all  dimensions  in  the  PRC  (Wang, \nWan, and Yang 2014; Gustafsson, Li, and Sicular 2010; Wan 2008a and 2008b). \n\nOne  particular  dimension  of  the  PRC\u2019s  income  distribution  that  has  received \nconsiderable attention is regional inequality (Wan 2006 and 2007; Wan, Lu, and Chen \n2007). Since different regions possess different endowments of resources, which also \ngenerate  different  returns  in  different  sectors  or  locations,  increases  in  regional \ninequality  are  not  unexpected,  as  confirmed  by  Wan  (2004  and  2007)  among  others. \nFigure  4  plots  regional  inequalities  in  per  capita  total  GDP,  as  well  as  in  sector  per \ncapita GDP, using the Gini coefficient as the measure of inequality. \n\nFigure 4: Gini Estimates of per Capita Total GDP and Sector GDPs \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nSeparating  into  pre-  and  post-reform  periods  (before  and  after  1978),  overall  regional \ninequality  seems  to  have  exhibited  trendless  fluctuations  in  the  pre-reform  period  if  \nthe spike around 1960 is excluded. The spike in the 3 disastrous years of 1958\u20131960 \ncan be attributed to the Great Leap Forward campaign, coupled with natural disasters. \nThe infamous campaign aimed at \u201csurpassing Britain and the United States\u201d in terms of \nindustrialization, which led to the sharp rise in the share of the secondary industry from \n31.3% in 1957 to 39.9% in 1958, and 46.3% and 51.8% respectively in 1959 and 1960 \nbefore  dropping  back  to  37.8%  in  1961.  Meanwhile,  the  natural  disasters  negatively \nimpacted  on  the  farming  sector  with  GDP  share  of  the  primary  industry  dropping  \nfrom  43.2%  in  1957  to  36.8%,  29.7%,  and  24.5%  in  1958\u20131960  before  recovering  to  \n35.0%  in  1961  (cf.  Figure  3).  These  structural  changes  are  most  dramatic  over  \nthe  entire  sample  period,  causing  the  largest  changes  in  regional  inequality  in  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  era  (see  Figure  7  and  related  discussions).  In  passing,  it  is  noted \nthat the spike mainly came from the contribution of the secondary industry (Figure 6). \nLeaving the spike aside, pre-reform regional inequality fluctuated within a small interval \nof  (0.21,  0.26).  The  next  pre-reform  peak  occurred  in  1974,  with  a  Gini  value  almost \nidentical to those in 1953 and 1954. The pre-reform trough occurred in 1967 with a Gini \nvalue of 0.21. \n\nThe post-reform period saw a generally rising trend in regional inequality until recently. \nIts  early  decline  from  1978  to  the  mid-1980s  can  be  attributed  to  the  household \nproduction  responsibility  system  and  increases  in  the  procurement  prices  for  grains, \nwhich helped narrow the urban\u2013rural gap, which constitutes no less than 50% of total \nregional inequality in the PRC (Wan 2007). When reform focus was shifted to the urban \nsector  in  the  mid-1980s,  regional  inequality  began  to  rise,  again  due  largely  to  the \nrising  urban\u2013rural  gap.  The  sudden  dip  in  1990  could  be  partly  attributable  to  the \nausterity policies implemented over 1989\u20131990. As Wan (2001) discovered, inequality \nin the PRC tends to drop during economic downturns, which may have also contributed \nto the inequality decline in recent years. The sharp increases in the mid-1990s followed \nthe major taxation system reform of 1994, which provides rich (poor) regions with more \n(less) revenues for local redistribution and spending. The recent reductions since 2004 \nhave  been  encouraging.  But  it  is  not  clear  whether  these  declines  represent  a  short-\nterm  fluctuation  like  that  in  the  early  1980s  or  a  long-term  trend  as  predicted  by  the \nKuznets hypothesis (see the end of section 4.3 for more discussion).  \n\nThe  empirical  results  of  this  subsection  help  confirm  the  theoretical  prediction  of \nsection  2  in  the  sense  that  structural  change  in  the  PRC  characterized  by \nindustrialization was found to be accompanied by rising inequality until the early 2000s. \nAs the PRC completes its industrialization process, inequality has begun to decline.  \n\n4.2  Economic Structure and Regional Inequality  \n\nNext, we discuss sector contributions to total inequality and identify which sector drives \nincome  distribution.  Figure  4  indicates  that  the  primary  sector  (sector  1)  is  the  most \nevenly  distributed  across  regions,  especially  from  the  mid-1960s  to  the  early  1980s. \nUnlike  in  the  primary  industry,  which  has  shown  a  linearly  rising  trend  since  2003, \ninequality  in  the  service  sector  (sector  3)  had  been  growing  continuously  until  2007, \nwhen it began to drop. The secondary industry has always been converging over time, \nparticularly  since  2003.  Manufacturing  (sector  2)  had  been  the  most  unequal  sector \nuntil 2005, when the service industry became the most dispersed sector. \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nFurther examination of Figure 4 reveals that total inequality closely correlated with that \nof the secondary industry until the mid-1980s. Since then, manufacturing inequality as \nindicated  by  its  Gini  coefficient  has  continued  to  decline  against  the  rising  trend  of \noverall inequality. On the other hand, service sector inequality exhibited a trend that is \nremarkably similar to that of overall inequality except for the unusual 3-disastrous-years \nperiod.  This  co-movement  is  a  little  surprising  as  the  PRC  economy  has  been \ndominated by manufacturing for a long time. Note that the service sector\u2019s share of the \neconomy  will  increase  further  largely  at  the  expense  of  the  secondary  industry.  In \naddition, while the secondary industry has always been converging, the service sector \nhas  been  diverging  since  the  early  1980s  and  the  rate  of  increase  in  the  divergence \nonly moderated a little in recent years. \n\nThe above findings provide evidence to support the first regularity we postulated at the \nbeginning  of  this  section  that  the  inequality  of  a  sector  is  related  to  its  growth  status. \nFor  example,  the  correlation  between  manufacturing  inequality  and  total  inequality  is \nhigh initially but gradually declines over time. Meanwhile, the service sector begins to \nplay an increasingly dominant role in driving total inequality. If such correlations imply \nany causal mechanism, further rise in regional inequality may be under way once the \nconvergence of the secondary sector reaches its stable state. These findings point to a \ncautious inequality scenario for the PRC as future growth will inevitably come with the \nexpansion of the service sector, as indicated in Figure 3a. \n\nNow,  attention  is  turned  to  examining  whether  the  manufacturing  sector  is  inequality-\nincreasing  first  and  then  inequality-decreasing.  As  discussed  earlier,  whenever  a  \nsector concentration index is greater than the total GDP Gini, it is inequality-increasing, \nand vice versa. Figure 5 plots the sector concentration indices along with the total GDP \nGini  estimates.  All  estimates  of  the  concentration  indices  are  positive  except  those  \nfor the  primary  industry  in  2007\u20132012. In  other words,  with  a  few  exceptions  all  GDP \ncomponents are positively correlated with total per capita GDP, thus richer regions tend \nto possess higher per capita GDP in all sectors. \n\nConforming to the first regularity, the primary industry is found to be always equalizing. \nConcentration  of the  primary  sector  has  been  low  and  declining  over time. Its  decline \nhas  accelerated  since  the  mid-1990s,  with  the  concentration  index  dropping  below \n0 from 2007. This is likely to have been caused by the abolition of agriculture taxes in \n2006,  for  the  first  time  in  the  PRC\u2019s  long  history.  Increasing  government  support  \nto  grain  producers  who  are  more  likely  to  be  poor  may  have  also  played  a  role.  Also \nconforming  to  the  first  regularity,  the  tertiary  industry  (sector  3)  has  always  been  \ndis-equalizing, with the only exception of the 3-disastrous-years period of 1959\u20131961. \nUnlike  the  other  two  sectors,  the  service  industry  has  been  diverging  since  the  \nearly  1980s  (Figures  4  and  5).  This  divergence,  reinforced  by  the  industry\u2019s  rising  \nGDP  share,  completely  accounted  for  the  increases  in  regional  inequality  from  the  \nmid-1990s to the mid-2000s (see Figure 6 and related discussions below).  \n\nMore interestingly, the manufacturing sector had been inequality-increasing until 2009. \nBut  there  is  a  declining  trend  in  both  its  Gini  (Figure  4)  and  its  concentration  indices \n(Figure 5), particularly from 2003 onward. This, once again, confirms the first regularity \ndiscussed  above.  The  causes  of  such  a  convergence  in  the  secondary  industry  are \nworth  future  research.  One  possibility  lies  in  industrial  relocation,  driven  by  improved \ninfrastructure  and  a  rapid  rise  in  production  costs  in  coastal  areas.  If  this  is  the  \ncase,  the  recently  emerging  equalizing  effect  of  the  secondary  industry  is  expected  \nto continue into the future. However, Lu and Xiang (2014) argued that the convergence \nmay be a result of government interventions and thus may not be sustainable.  \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nFigure 5: Sector Concentration Indices and the Total GDP Gini \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n\n \n\nContrasting  Figures  4  and  5  reveals  that  for  the  service  or  the  secondary  industry,  \nits  Gini  and  concentration  indices  share  a  similar  trend,  even  with  similar  values.  \nThe  correlation  coefficients  between  these  two  indices  are  as  high  as  0.997  for  \nthe  manufacturing  sector  and  0.978  for  the  service  sector.  These  imply  that  richer \nprovinces  have  higher  per  capita  GDPs  from  the  nonfarming  sectors.  The  primary \nindustry\u2019s  Gini  and  concentration  indexes  resembled  each  other  until  the  late  1990s, \nbut  their  trends  have  diverged  in  the  last  10  years  or  so.  The  two  indexes  were \npositively  correlated  only  until  1994,  with  a  correlation  coefficient  0.942.  Adding  the \nremaining  later  observations,  the  correlation  coefficient  drops  to  0.198.  For  the  latest \nperiod  of  1995\u20132012, the  correlation  coefficient becomes  \u20130.869. These  results  imply \nthat per capita agriculture GDP has been higher in poorer regions only in recent years.  \n\nTo obtain sector contributions to total inequality, equation (3.4) is applied to provincial \npopulation and sector GDP data2, available from National Bureau of Statistics (various \nyears). The results  are shown  in  Figure  6.  Figure  6  demonstrates  that throughout  the \nsample  period,  the  secondary  industry  has  played  a  dominant  role  in  constituting \nregional inequality. Until the early 1990s, more than half of total regional inequality can \nbe accounted for by the uneven development of the secondary industry. This is in line \nwith  popular  perception.  But  what  is  unknown  to  many  is  the  finding  that  the  tertiary \nsector\u2019s  contribution  has  been  rising  since  the  early  1980s,  particularly  after  the  mid-\n1990s. By the mid-2000s, rather surprisingly, it overtook the secondary industry as the \nmost  important  contributor to  regional  inequality.  In fact,  all  increases  in total regional \ninequality from 1994 until 2003 came from the tertiary sector. On the other hand, most \nof  the  decreases  in  total  regional  inequality  after  2004  came  from  the  secondary,  not \nthe tertiary, industry. These empirical findings corroborate well with the two regularities \nand prediction of our theoretical model. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n2   Inequality is usually measured in terms of per capita income or consumption. However, only GDP data \npermit breakdowns into sector components for analyzing the structural effects. Income data by sectors \nor  industries  are  not  available.  In  any  case,  regional  inequality  based  on  GDP  data  shares  the  same \ntrend as those based on income or consumption data (Wang, Wan, and Yang 2014).  \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nAs the concentration index of the service sector remains high (Figure 5), and its GDP \nshare is expected to continue to rise, uneven development of the tertiary industry must \nreceive priority consideration in the fight against regional inequality. On the other hand, \nthe  concentration  index  of  the  primary  industry  GDP  has  consistently  been  small  and \nmoved into negative territory as of 2007 (Figure 5) and its GDP share has been below \n10%  since  2009  (Figure  3a).  Therefore,  the  contribution  of  the  primary  industry  to \nregional  inequality  must  be  small  and  becoming  negligible  over  time,  as  confirmed  \nby Figure 6. \n\nFigure 6: Sector Contributions to Regional Inequality \n\nNote: On the y-axis, the Gini coefficient is shown. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3  Accounting for Changes in Regional Inequality: The Role  \n\nof Structural Transformation \n\nTo  account  for  inequality  changes,  equation  (3.9)  is  applied  to  the  PRC  data.  The \ndecomposition results, as shown in Figure 7, demonstrate that the secondary industry \nhas  dominated  not  only  the  contributions  to  the  level  of  total  regional  inequality,  but \nalso the contributions to changes in total inequality. In particular, the spike in the Great \nLeap Forward period is clearly attributable to the secondary industry. The contributions \nof  the  primary  sector  to  inequality  changes  were  visible  in  the  pre-reform  period  but \ndiminished over time and largely disappeared after 1990. The role of the service sector \nin  driving  inequality  changes  became  more  visible  from  the  mid-1980s.  However,  this \nrole lost significance in the last 7 years when total inequality declined, despite its rising \nand dominant contributions to total inequality (cf. Figure 6). \n\nIt  is  commonly  accepted  that  year-to-year  changes  in  inequality  are  typically  small. \nHowever,  our  results  demonstrate  that  small  changes  can  accumulate  rather  quickly. \nThere are four major peaks in total regional inequality in the PRC, appearing in 1960, \n1974,  1994,  and  2003.  The  first  three  were  formed  by  only  2\u20133  years  of  successive \nsmall rises. The 2003 peak was preceded by 7 years of even smaller increases. More \ninterestingly,  the  significant  decline  in  regional  inequality  since  2004  is  caused  by \n7 years of consecutive small decreases. \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nFigure 7: Sector Contributions to Changes in Regional Inequality \n\nNote: On the y-axis, the Gini coefficient is shown. \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n\nthe \n\nfinding  confirms \n\ninequality-increasing.  This \n\nFigure  8  shows  the  structural  and  concentration  effects.  It  is  interesting  to  observe  \nthe  following:  (i)  Out  of  a  total  of  60  years,  49  years  saw  positive  structural  effects, \nmeaning \ntheoretical  postulation \ndiscussed in section 2 of this paper: structural change brings about inequality, making \nsome  people  gain  more  while  others  gain  less  or  even  lose.  (ii)  Out  of  a  total  of \n60 years, 34 years saw negative concentration effects. During 1968\u20131971, 1975\u20131981, \nand 2004\u20132012, they were successively negative and during 1991\u20131994 successively \npositive.  No  systematic  pattern  can  be  detected  in  other  years.  (iii)  Prior  to  2004, \nstructural  effects  mostly  co-moved  with  changes  in  total  regional  inequality,  implying \nthat  regional  inequality  can  be  largely  attributable  to  structural  effects.  For  example, \n1983  marks  the  year  of  division  between  decreasing  and  then  increasing  total \ninequality. And in the same year, we saw the negative and then positive values of the \nstructural  effects.  (iv)  There  is  a  clear  converging  trend  in  the  structural  effects\u2014the \nfluctuations  becoming  smaller  over  time,  corresponding  well  with  gradual  movement \ntoward  completion  of  the  industrialization  process.  This  is  better  seen  in  Figure  9, \nwhich plots the cumulative structural and concentration effects. \n\nFigure 8: Structural Effects and Concentration Effects of Inequality Changes \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: On the y-axis, the Gini coefficient is shown. \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nUntil  1972,  the  structural  and  concentration  effects  seemed  to  reinforce  each  other, \nwith  a  1-year  lag  or  lead  sometimes.  They  became  offsetting  to  each  other  during \n1973\u20131985. From 1985 to 2003, they were weakly but positively correlated. No obvious \ncorrelation can be found in the post-2003 period, when structural effects diminished to \n0 while the concentration effects turned negative with a declining trend. \n\nFigure  9  plots  the  cumulate  structural  and  concentration  effects,  confirming  that  the \nstructural  effects  were  mostly  positive.  Up  to  the  period  of  the  Great  Leap  Forward, \ntheir absolute values were larger than those of the concentration effects. From 1961 to \n1994, structural effects took alternate signs and their magnitude became small, smaller \nthan  the  corresponding  concentration  effects  in  a  majority  of  years,  particularly  after \n1985.  Since  1994,  the  structural  effects  have  always  been  positive  with  only  one \nexception,  but  their  values  have  gradually  converged  to  zero.  During  2007\u20132012, \nstructural effects can be hardly seen at all (Figure 8). But, in contrast to the diminishing \nstructural  effects  over  time,  the  concentration  effects  were  relatively  large  from  \nabout  1982  onward  and  became  dominant  after  2006.  These  results  help  verify  our \ntheoretical model. \n\nFigure 9: Cumulative Structural and Concentration Effects \n\nNote: On the y-axis, the Gini coefficient is shown. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n\n \n\nWhich  effects,  the  structural  or  concentration  effects,  are  more  important?  Figure  8 \nindicates  that  the  concentration  effects  in  absolute  terms  are  larger  most  of  the  time. \nFurther,  Figure  9  shows  that  in  more  recent  years,  they  drove  the  decline  in  total \nregional  inequality  (section  4.4).  Thus,  it  can  be  concluded  that  concentration  effects \nbasically dominated the regional inequality profile in the PRC. As mentioned previously, \nstructural  effects,  by  definition,  are  indispensable  to  growth  and  they  form  part  of  the \ngrowth regularity. Fortunately, the structural effects are converging to 0, corroborating \nthe  observation  that  the  industrialization  phase  of  structural  transformation  is \napproaching  completion  in  the  PRC.  This  is  consistent  with  the  very  hypothesis  that \nmotivated this paper. \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n\f(4.1) \n\n(4.2) \n\n(4.3) \n\n(4.4) \n\nADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\n4.4  Modeling the Structural Effects \n\nTo  formally  verify  regularities  2  and  3,  we  conduct  regression  analysis  in  this \nsubsection.

This \ndecline also appears when household or individual data are used. It thus makes sense \nto shed some light on this important trend. To provide more insight, the structural and \nconcentration  effects  are  disaggregated  by  sectors.  The  results  are  tabulated  in \nTable 3  (with  percentage  contributions  adding  up  to  100).  It  is  clear  that  the  declines \nare basically driven by significant reductions in industry concentrations, particularly that  \nof  the  secondary  industry  and  to  some  extent  that  of  the  service  industry.  If  one  \nadds up these two reductions, the combined contribution accounts for at least 85% of \neach of the declines in regional inequality over the period 2006\u20132012. Conversely, the \nstructural  effects  are  mostly  inequality-increasing  but  they  are  all  quite  small.  What \ndrives the convergences in industry concentration is a question worth further research, \nbut  industry  relocation  and  increasing  flows  of  foreign  direct  investment  to  the  inland \nprovinces over the last few years are part of the explanation. \n\nTable 3: Recent Declines in Regional Inequality: Decomposition Results (%) \n\nFrom \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n\nTo \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n\nConcentration Effects \n\nStructural Effects \n\nSector 1  Sector 2  Sector 3  Sector 1  Sector 2  Sector 3  Sum \n\u2013100 \n\u201327.57 \n\u2013100 \n\u201317.44 \n\u2013100 \n\u20138.00 \n\u2013100 \n9.71 \n\u2013100 \n\u20135.43 \n\u2013100 \n\u20134.14 \n\u2013100 \n0.72 \n\n\u2013206.57 \n\u201383.98 \n\u201383.77 \n\u201393.12 \n\u201398.12 \n\u201370.40 \n\u201360.39 \n\n85.84 \n\u20134.15 \n12.53 \n\u201341.66 \n20.16 \n3.26 \n\u201324.28 \n\n38.02 \n\u20134.54 \n\u201311.51 \n\u201346.32 \n\u20130.24 \n\u201328.15 \n\u201351.09 \n\n15.37 \n10.18 \n\u20139.35 \n70.83 \n\u201316.63 \n\u20130.76 \n35.00 \n\n\u20135.09 \n\u20130.09 \n0.10 \n0.57 \n0.26 \n0.20 \n0.04 \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\n5.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION \n\nThis  paper  postulates  that  structural  changes  triggered  by  technological  (e.g., \nemergences  of  information  and  communication  technology  and  e-commerce),  cultural \n(e.g., rising demand for health food), institutional (e.g., the PRC\u2019s reform and opening \nup),  or  policy  (e.g.,  a  privatization  move)  shocks  bring  about  resource  reallocation \nacross  sectors  and  locations,  leading  to  disequilibriums  in  factor  demand  and  supply \nand  thus  causing  changes  in  income  inequality.  As  structural  transformation  slows \ndown  or  approaches  its  completion,  equilibriums  tend  to  be  restored  and  inequality \ntends  to  decline.  We  construct  a  model  to  characterize  this  process,  demonstrating \nrelationship of inverted U shape between inequality and structural transformation. Our \ntheoretical  model  is  different  from  the  famous  Kuznets  hypothesis  as  Kuznets  (1955) \nfocused  on  the  growth\u2013inequality  relationship,  which  was  not  formalized  either.  It  is \nalso  different  from  the  convergence  or  catch-up  literature,  including  Caselli  and \nColeman (2001). \n\nDecomposition  frameworks  are  then  developed  to  account  for  the  level  of  inequality \nand for the changes in the level of inequality. A change in inequality can be attributed \nto  structural  transformation  (called  structural  effect)  and  variation  in  concentration \nindexes (called concentration effect). According to our theoretical model, the structural \neffects are expected to be positively correlated with structural transformation and tend \nto disappear when the latter approaches completion. These theoretical predictions are \nconfirmed by empirical evidence from the PRC. \n\nApplying  the  decomposition  technique  to  PRC  data  yields  several  fresh,  interesting, \nand important findings. First of all, the structural effects mostly co-moved with changes \nin total regional equality before 2004. But it has recently converged to 0, confirming our \ntheoretical postulation that motivated this paper. Conversely, the concentration effects \nbecame relatively large after 1982 and became dominant after 2006. \n\nSecond,  the  primary  industry  has  always  been  equalizing  while  the  tertiary  industry  \nhas  always  been  dis-equalizing  except  the  unusual  3-year  period  of  1959\u20131961.  The \nmanufacturing sector had accounted for more than half of the total regional inequality \nuntil the early 1990s and had been dis-equalizing until 2009. It also dominated sectoral \ncontributions  to  inequality  changes.  But  this  important  sector  has  always  been \nconverging spatially, particularly after 2003. \n\nThird,  the  service  industry  has  been  spatially  diverging  since  the  early  1980s.  By  the \nmid-2000s,  it  overtook  the  secondary  industry  as  the  most  important  contributor  to \nregional inequality. In fact, all increases in total regional inequality from 1994 until 2003 \ncame from the tertiary sector. In addition, total regional inequality has closely co-moved \nwith  that  of  the  service  sector  since  1966.  Because  its  GDP  share  will  rise  further, \ncoupled  with  a  high  concentration  index,  uneven  development  of  the  tertiary  industry \nmust receive priority consideration in the fight against regional inequality in the future, \nespecially when the secondary sector converges to its stable state.  \n\nFinally, the structural and concentration effects are found to reinforce each other until \n1972.  They  became  offsetting  to  each  other  during  1973\u20131985.  From  1985  to  2003, \nthey  are  weakly  but  positively  correlated.  Little  correlation  can  be  found  after  2003 \nwhen structural effects diminished to 0 while the concentration effects turned negative \nwith a declining trend. \n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nThese  findings  have  profound  implications  for  the  PRC.  Fast-rising  inequality  in  the \nPRC  has  largely  been  driven  by  structural  transformation,  which  is  indispensable  to \ngrowth and forms part of the growth regularity. But the structural effects have basically \ndisappeared  and  the  concentration  effects  are  becoming  dominant.  Looking  forward, \nthe  poorer  inland  areas  in  the  PRC  possess  comparative  advantages  in  producing \nagricultural  and  mining  products.  As  the  share  of  the  equalizing  primary  industry \ndiminishes (see Figure 4 and its related discussion), regional inequality is likely to rise. \nOn  the  other  hand,  services  are  less  tradable  than  commodities,  thus  the  location \nadvantage  of  coastal  regions  in  manufactured  exports  is  expected  to  decline  as  the \nGDP share of the tertiary sector rises. Consequently, regional inequality may decrease \nor  increase  as  the  PRC  continues  to  transform  from  a  manufacturing-dominant  to  a \nservice-dominant economy, partly depending on the emerging structural effects that will \nbe  driven  by  the  increasing  dominance  of  the  service  sector.  Thus,  it  is  important  to \nsupport the development of the tertiary sector in the lagging areas so as to alleviate the \npotentially rising concentration effects. \n\n \n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 608 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nWan, Wang, and Zhang \n\nCaselli, F., and W.
