INTRODUCTION \nGiven the relationship between inequality and growth (Lewis 1955; Kuznets 1955; \nWilliamson 1965; Huw and Bernhardt 2000) and the well-recognized link between \ngrowth  and  structural  change  (Laitner  1999;  Echevarria  1997;  Fan,  Zhang,  and \nRobinson 2003), it is natural to ask if and how structural transformation affects income \ndistribution.  The  special  significance  of  exploring  the  structural  change\u2013inequality \nnexus  lies  in  that  structural  transformation  is  almost  indispensable  to  long-run \neconomic growth in both developing and developed economies. Therefore, inequality \nchanges  that  are  attributable  to  structural  transformation,  if  existent,  form  part  of  \nthe growth regularity and are inevitable. On the other hand, structural transformation  \nis  a  transitional  process.  Consequently,  any  inequality  change  associated  with \nstructural  transformation  is  expected  to  disappear  once  the  latter  is  complete.  It  \nfollows that policy interventions to contain or curb this component of inequality changes \nare unnecessary. \nDespite its theoretical and empirical significance, little research attention has been \nfocused on the inequality\u2013structural change nexus, although there are many studies  \non income distribution or structural transformation separately. For the case of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), see Wan (2008a, 2008b) and Wang, Wan, and \nYang (2014) on income distribution and Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2011) on structural \ntransformation. The classic works of Kuznets (1955) and Lewis (1955) focus on the \nrelationship between growth (not structural change per se) and inequality, which is \nlargely applicable to developing economies only. Structural change, however, is a \ncommon feature of all economies. \nThis paper contributes to the literature by developing a general equilibrium model, \ndemonstrating a relationship of inverted U shape between inequality and structural \nchange.  Decomposition frameworks  are then derived  that  can  be  used  to  identify \n(i) sectoral contributions to total inequality and (ii) the changes in inequality attributable \nto structural transformation (the structural component) and to concentration or spatial \nagglomeration  (the  concentration  component). Finally,  we  apply  the  decomposition \nframeworks to data from the PRC. \nThe  PRC  offers  an  excellent  opportunity  for  investigating  the  structural  change\u2013\ninequality  nexus.  Policy  shocks  initiated  in  late  1978  and  a  series  of  reforms \nimplemented in the following years led to significant structural transformation, meaning \nlarge-scale resource flows across locations and sectors. In particular, the huge number \nof rural-to-urban migrants in the PRC, now estimated in the order of 270 million, would \nhave been unemployed or underemployed in the absence of such structural changes. \nHolding everything else constant, such structural transformation is expected to help \nreduce inequality, as those migrants who were most likely to be under- or unemployed \nnow earn decent income. Of course, in reality little can be held constant. In fact, \ninequality in the PRC has risen rapidly, leading to serious and multiple socioeconomic \nproblems.  Clearly,  identifying  and  quantifying  the  impacts  of  structural  change  on \ninequality will help provide valuable policy implications for the PRC government and \npossibly other institutions. \nIn  addition  to  confirming  the  relationship  of  inverted  U  shape  predicted  by  our \ntheoretical model, other major empirical findings of this paper include: (i) Regional \ninequality in pre-reform PRC was broadly trendless while a rising trend emerged after \nreforms  that  began  in  late  1978.  (ii)  Structural  transformation  was  \nthe  main  driver  of  regional  inequality  before  2004  but  spatial  concentration  or \nagglomeration became the dominant component after 2006. (iii) The structural and \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nconcentration components tended to reinforce each other until 1972 and offset each \nother during 1973\u20131985. They seem uncorrelated in other years. (iv) The agriculture \nsector had been always inequality-reducing while the service sector almost always  \ndis-equalizing. The manufacturing sector accounted for more than half of total regional \ninequality before the mid-1990s, but this role was taken over by the service sector after \nthe mid-2000s. (v) The service industry has been spatially diverging since the early \n1980s. By the mid-2000s, it overtook the secondary industry as the most important \ncontributor to regional inequality. From 1994 to 2003, all increases in total regional \ninequality came from the tertiary sector. \nBefore proceeding further, it is useful to mention the study by Caselli and Coleman \n(2001), which may appear to be closely related to this study. However, our paper \ndiffers from theirs in several aspects: (i) We consider only one economy, and model the \nentire process of inequality evolution due to structural change caused by technological \nor other shocks, while they consider multiple regional economies of the United States \n(US) and focus on income convergence (not the entire process of inequality change) \ndriven by reductions in education cost. (ii) We focus on divergence and convergence in \ninter-sector gaps while they focus on convergence in total income across regions. \nThus, the steady state or completion of structural transformation in our paper implies \ndisappearance of inter-sector gaps, not necessarily convergence in total income. The \nsteady state in their papers means disappearance of gaps in total income, inter-sector \nincome, and economic structure across regions. (iii) As far as empirical application is \nconcerned, we account for the level as well as changes in regional inequality in the \nPRC, while they explain the declining gaps in income level and economic structure \nacross regions in the US.  \nThe plan of our paper is as follows. Section 2 presents graphical illustrations and a \ntheoretical  model  demonstrating  how  technology  shocks  cause  structural  \nchange that, in turn, induces an inverted U shape of inequality. Section 3 proposes \ndecomposition techniques for identifying and measuring sector contributions to total \ninequality and the contribution of structural transformation to a change in inequality, \nwhere inequality is indicated by the popular Gini coefficient. In Section 4, the proposed \ndecomposition techniques are applied to provincial gross domestic product (GDP) data \nfrom  the  PRC,  confirming  the  inverted  U  shape  and  providing  several  fresh  and \ninsightful empirical findings. Section 5 concludes. \n2.  THE STRUCTURAL CHANGE\u2013INEQUALITY NEXUS \nStructural change can occur in any economy at any stage of its development. Broadly \nspeaking, it often refers to the process of industrialization or rising dominance of the \nservice sector. But structural transformation can and increasingly does take place at a \nmore  disaggregated  level  of  industry  classification.  For  example,  the  information \ntechnology shock not only led to the creation of the information and communication \ntechnology industry but also has exerted tremendous impacts on many other sectors \nsuch as telecommunication and banking services. It has certainly caused disequilibria \nin the labor markets for many years and generated significant wage premiums for \ninformation and communication technology professionals in the early days. Those who \nstepped into this sector early enjoyed higher remuneration, leading to significant inter-\nsector wage gaps. As another example, the policy shocks initiated in the late 1970s of \nthe PRC (see section 4 of this paper for more discussion) led to significant structural \nchanges, affecting urban\u2013rural income disparity and possibly increasing inequalities \nwithin rural and urban areas, too. \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \n \nBeneath any structural transformation are the flows of resources, such as labor and \ncapital, across industries and locations. For example, as nonfarming sectors boom and \nthe primary sector shrinks in the PRC, hundreds of millions of laborers have migrated \nfrom  rural  areas  to  the  cities,  from  agriculture  to  jobs  in  the  manufacturing  and  \nservice  sectors,  and  from  inland  to  coastal  regions.  Such  large-scale  migration, \nunprecedented in human history, is largely driven by disequilibria in factor markets \namid  structural  transformations.  As  a  stylized  fact,  surplus  rural  labor  and  rising \ndemand of nonagriculture sectors for low-skilled labor coexist in almost all emerging \neconomies, implying that both rural and urban labor markets can be in disequilibrium.  \nTo illustrate, assume an economy with two sectors (sectors i and j). Figure 1(a) shows \nthe economy at the initial equilibrium with labor inputs L* and L*, as determined by \ni j\nlabor demand D and supply S, appropriately indexed. Both sectors pay the same wage \nW* and there is no inequality. \nFigure 1(a): Structural Change and Inequality: Initial Equilibrium \n \nSource: Authors' adaptation. \n \nNow there comes a technological, cultural, institutional, or policy shock, which shifts \nlabor demand in sector i upward from D  to D in Figure 1(b). This, in the short run, will \ni1 i2 \nlead to an increase of wage in sector i to W, because labor supply cannot adjust to the \n1\ndemand change due to skill mismatch, job transfer or adjustment costs, and so on. \nWage or income inequality thus emerges. The wage difference, of course, will induce \nlabor flows from sector j to sector i, as indicated by the arrows under the horizontal axis \nin Figure 1(b).  \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nFigure 1(b): Structural Change and Inequality: Disequilibrium \n \nSource: Authors' adaptation. \n \nThis labor flow, likely to be a gradual process, will eventually lead to a new equilibrium, \nwith same wage W** in both sectors, as shown in Figure 1(b). Contrasting Figures 1(a) \nand 1(b), output and input(s) in sector i grow but they decline in sector j, implying \nstructural change. Figure 1(c) shows the entire process. \nFigure 1(c): Structural Change and Inequality: The Transition Process \n \nSource: Authors' adaptation. \nThe above depicts a relationship of inverted U shape between inequality and structural \nchange,  holding  everything  else  constant.  At  the  onset  of  a  structural  change \n(disequilibrium),  inequality  rises  but  then  decreases  as  structural  transformation \napproaches  completion.  Of  course,  inequality  often  persists  since  structural \ntransformation could last for a long time, particularly when markets are fragmented,  \nas in the PRC. It is useful to reiterate that this inverted U shape is applicable to both \nindustrialized  and  developing  economies  provided  structural  changes  of  any  kind  \ntake place. Such a pattern between inequality and structural transformation is different \nfrom,  although  related  to,  the  Kuznets  hypothesis,  which  intends  to  establish  a  \ngrowth\u2013inequality  relationship.  The  mechanism  underlying  the  Kuznets  hypothesis  \nis also different. As Lewis (1955) pointed out, growth usually does not take place \neverywhere and not everyone is positioned to gain from growth at the same rate. As  \na consequence, growth often comes with rising inequality. Kuznets (1955) offered \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nanecdotal  evidence  on  and  discussed  why  the  growth\u2013inequality  relationship  may \nexhibit an inverted U shape.  \nThe graphical illustration is informative but unrealistic. In reality, it is rare to have \ncomplete equilibrium to begin with. That is, the initial inequality is unlikely to be nil. In \naddition, for many developing economies, the urban\u2013rural gap is typically large and \nsurplus labor exists in relatively lagging rural areas with an almost horizontal labor \nsupply curve. In this case, flows of labor from rural to urban sectors will help raise rural \nincome (e.g., via remittances and increased resources per unit of labor in rural areas) \nwhile keeping urban wages from rising. Even in mature economies, inter-industry wage \ngaps persist. \nTo formalize the structural change\u2013inequality nexus, without the unrealistic assumption \nof initial wage equality and other limitations of the graphical illustration, we begin with a \nsimple  variant  of  the  standard  two-sector  dynamic  equilibrium  model.  For  easy \nexposition, we will call these sectors a traditional and a modern sector. The economy is \npopulated by overlapping generations of two-period-lived agents. All agents only work \nfor one period in a sector of their choice. Moving from one sector to another incurs \nmigration costs. \nProduction \nThe traditional sector is labor intensive and uses labor as the only input. The modern \nsector uses both capital and labor for production and is subject to shocks such as \ntechnological advances or institutional reforms. The products of both sectors can be \neither consumed or saved for future capital formation. \nLet t index time, r index the traditional sector, Y denote value of output, and L denote \nlabor input. The production function of the traditional sector takes a simple form where \none unit of labor produces one unit of output (Gollin et al. 2002; Yang and Zhu 2013): \n   (2.1) \nThe lab\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4co\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5fr\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f i=s p\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5fa\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5fid its value of marginal product, thus the wage of the traditional sector \ncan be expressed as: \n   (2.2) \nThe  m\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64od\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5fer=n 1sector  is  characterized  by  the  standard  Cobb\u2013Douglas  production \nfunction: \n  (2.3) \n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc 1\u2212\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\nwhere m\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a i\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5fn=de\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34xe\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3es\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3fth\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5ae\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f modern sector,   denotes the capital share, and   denotes total \nfactor productivity.

Any positive shock will bring in a \ntemporary wage increase to the relevant sector, leading to changes in inequality or \nwage gaps, which induce labor transfers. Such transfers will help gradually restore \nequilibriums in the labor markets of all sectors. Consequently, the wage gaps will \nnarrow over time. When the structural change comes to completion, its impact on \ninequality change disappears.  \n3.  ACCOUNTING FOR INEQUALITY AND ITS CHANGES: \nTHE ROLES OF ECONOMIC STRUCTURE AND \nSTRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION \nIt is important to point out that structural changes may be accompanied by changes in \ninequality  within  sectors  and  that  inequality  could  be  driven  by  forces  other  than \nstructural transformation. These forces determine the levels of inequality before the \nonset, as well as after the completion, of a structural change. Thus, the structural \ntransformation\u2013inequality relationship is complex and may vary over time and from \neconomy  to  economy.  The  analytical  challenge  lies  in  how  to  disentangle  the \ncontribution of structural transformation to an overall change in total inequality, an issue \nto be addressed in this section. \nConsistent with the theoretical model in section 2, inequality will be measured by the \npopular Gini coefficient. A particular advantage of the Gini coefficient was shown by \nDagnum  (1990),  who  proved  that  the  social  welfare  function  underlying  the  Gini \ncoefficient is an increasing function of the mean income and a decreasing function of \nincome inequality. In contrast, other inequality measures, including the generalized \nentropy family and Atkinson measures, generally imply decreases in social welfare \nfollowing a drop in income of an economic unit irrespective of what might happen to the \noverall income distribution. \nOne way of computing the Gini coefficient is to follow Silber (1989): \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \n   (3.1) \nwhere G\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51d=en\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43o\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43te\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43s the Gini estimate, P is a row vector containing the shares of income-\nd \nreceiving units, and I is a column vector containing the corresponding income shares. \nBoth are ranked by increasing values of per capita income of the income-receiving \nunits. Finally, Q is a square matrix with appropriate dimensions with q  = 0 if i = j, q  = 1 \nij ij\nif i < j, and q = \u20131 if i > j. \nij\nNow, suppose total income Y is composed of K sources or components, i.e., Y = Y + \n1 \nY  + ... + Y . When equation (3.1) is applied to a particular source of income Y , the \n2 K k\ncorresponding Gini ratio, denoted by G , indicates inequality in the k-th factor income \nk\nand can be computed using the following equation: \n  (3.2) \nwhere P\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58is= a\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 r\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58o\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43w\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58vector of shares of income-receiving units who receive Y , and I  is a \nk  k k\ncolumn vector of income shares computed using data on the k-th component income. \nBoth are ranked by increasing values of per capita component income Y  (not per \nk\ncapita total income Y). When the P  and I  vectors are ranked by increasing values of \nk k\nper capita total income Y instead of Y , one obtains the concentration index C : \nk k\n  (3.3) \n\u2217 \u2217\nwhere P\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58* a=n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43d\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 I\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43*\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 c\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58ontain the same elements as P  and I  do, but these elements are \nk k k k\nnow ranked by increasing values of per capita total income Y, not component income \nY . Thus, C = G  and only if the ordering of the total income and that of the k-th \nk k  k if\ncomponent income are the same. While any Gini ratio G or G  takes value in the \nk  d\ninterval (0, 1), C lies between \u2013G and G (Kakawin 1977, p. 721).  \nk  k  k \nIt is useful to note that C  < 0 means that source income k is negatively correlated  \nk\nwith total income. In this case, the poor receive more Y  than the rich. And an increase \nk\nin  the  k-th  source  income,  holding  its  distribution  unchanged,  will  help  moderate  \ntotal inequality. In fact, C  < 0 overstates the condition for the k-th income to be \nk\ninequality-reducing. The k-th income is inequality-reducing as long as C  < G (Podder \nk d \nand Chatterjee 2002). The contrary is true when C  > G . \nk d\nLet u and u denote the mean of the total income and the mean of the k-th component \nk  \nincome, and G  can be expressed as (Kakwani 1977: 724): \nd\n   (3.4) \nwhere S\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51== u\u2211/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58u \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36d\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58o\u2044t\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62es= t\u2211he\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46s\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58h\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36a\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58re of the k-th income in total income. Thus, the Gini \nk  k\ncoefficient can be interpreted as a weighted average of K concentration indices, using \nthe income shares as weights.  \nEquation (3.4) can be used to explore the composition of a Gini estimate, providing \ninsights on which income source deserves more consideration in the fight against \ninequality. It follows that S C /G  represents the percentage contribution of component \nk k d\nincome k to the overall income inequality. \nHowever, a dominant contributor in terms of inequality composition may not be a major \ncontributor to a change in inequality. An analogous case is the distinction between \nsources  of  economic  growth  and  the  composition  of  an  economy.  For  example, \nagriculture may represent a major component of a developing economy, but economic \ngrowth  could  come  largely  from  nonagriculture  sectors.  Similarly,  the  unequal \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \ndistribution or spatial concentration of the manufacturing industry may dominate the \noverall regional inequality in the PRC, but it might be a small contributor to changes in \nregional inequality.  \nTo disentangle the contribution of various income sources to an inequality change, let \nG  = G  \u2013 G  and similarly defining  S  and  C .

For \nexample, suppose there was an increase in the k-th component income by x percent \nfor everyone. Clearly, this does not affect the inequality of any component income \nincluding that of the k-th income as long as relative inequality measures are used. \nHowever, S is now greater and all other income shares will alter. If the k-th income is \nk \nmore equally distributed than the total income, the overall inequality following such an \nincrease should drop, and vice versa. This change in the overall income inequality is \nsolely and completely attributable to variations in the income shares.  \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nSo far, equations (3.4)\u2013(3.9) are expressed or derived using S  as income shares. Let \nk\nN denote national population, since S  = u /u = N u /N u and when income sources are \nk k k\ncategorized by economic sectors, S  then represents sector share in the national GDP. \nk\nConsequently, equation (3.4) can be used to explore sector contributions to the overall \ninequality and equation (3.9) can be used to quantify the contributions of structural \ntransformation  to  inequality  changes.

In most developing countries such as the PRC, increases in \ninequality due to structural transformation (relative decline in agriculture is commonly \nobserved in less developed countries) are inevitable as urbanization, industrialization, \nand service sector development take place. In other words, less developed countries \nand transitional economies almost certainly have to experience this kind of inequality \nincreases led by structural transformation, sooner or later. Under this circumstance, \nany  interventions  to  curb  inequality  rise  induced  by  the  structure  change  are \ninappropriate.  On  the  other  hand,  the  structural  effects  will  diminish  and  finally \ndisappear  as  an  economy  approaches  its  completion  of  structural  adjustment,  as \npredicted  by  our  theoretical  model  of  section  2,  and  confirmed  by  the  empirical \nevidence presented in the next section. \n \n4.  STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND REGIONAL \nINEQUALITY IN CHINA: AN EMPIRICAL \nAPPLICATION \nSection 3 of this paper proposes a decomposition framework that can be used to \nidentify and measure sector contributions to total inequality as well as the impacts of \nstructural transformation on inequality changes. Combining the theoretical result of \nsection 2 with the Kuznets hypothesis, three empirical regularities can be postulated: \n(i) Sector contributions to total inequality depend on their development status; that is, \nan  emerging  industry  such  as  the  tertiary  sector  in  the  PRC  is  expected  to  be \ninequality-increasing while a sunset industry such as the primary sector is predicted to \nplay an equalizing role. Manufacturing\u2019s contribution to inequality will increase first, and \nthen decrease. (ii) As far as the structural effects of inequality changes are concerned, \nthe manufacturing sector is expected to be the dominant driver, followed by the service \nsector and finally the primary industry. But in recent years, the tertiary sector has \nbecome the dominant determinant. (iii) The structural effect is a quadratic function of \neconomic  structures\u2014the  inverted  U  shape.  In  particular,  the  structural  effect  is \nexpected to converge to zero as industrialization approaches completion in the PRC. \nTo verify these regularities, the profiles of structural change and regional inequality  \nin the PRC are provided in section 4.1. Section 4.2 explores sector contributions to  \nthe level of total regional inequality. This is followed by section 4.3, which analyzes \nchanges in regional inequality, focusing on the structural effect. Section 4.4 models  \nthe overall and sector structural effects to test the second and third regularities; and \nfinally, as a digression, we briefly discuss the recent declines in the total inequality \nin section 4.5. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \n4.1  Structural Transformation and Regional Inequality Profiles \nThe  PRC\u2019s  recent  economic  takeoff  began  with  the  official  introduction  of  the \nagricultural production responsibility system in late 1978, which significantly raised \nincomes  of  farmers.  Rural  income  growth  stimulated  demand  for  nonagricultural \ncommodities,  which  provided  the  necessary  condition  for  expanding  the  nonfarm \nsectors. By the mid-1980s, reforms were extended into cities and towns. These reforms \nplus the open-door strategy provided sufficient conditions for the expansion of the \nnonfarm sectors, particularly the manufacturing industry, including the enterprises in \ntowns and villages. Industrial growth, in turn, generated employment opportunities for \nsurplus labor in rural PRC, which led to further increases in the income and demand of \nrural households. The virtuous circle then sets in, reinforced by a series of reforms and \nfurther opening-up policies to take advantage of the global market and foreign direct \ninvestment. Thus, the so-called PRC miracle has emerged. \nAccompanying the PRC miracle is swift structural transformation (Figure 3a). At the \nnational level, the GDP share of the primary industry decreased from 54.6% in 1952,  \nto 29.5% in 1977, and to 10.0% in 2012, while the corresponding share of the service \nsector increased from 22.6% to 28.2% and further to 46.1%. Meanwhile, the GDP \nshare of the secondary industry grew from 22.8% in 1952 to 50.0% in 1977 and has \nsince fluctuated between 40% and 52%. Looking forward, there is limited room for \nsignificant declines of the primary industry, especially given the commitments of the \ncurrent leadership to food security and rural development. But the prominence of the \nservice sector will continue to grow at the expense of the manufacturing sector.  \n   \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nFigure 3: Economic Structure (GDP Composition) of the PRC  \nand Representative Provinces \n \n   \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nFigure 3 continued \n \n   \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nFigure 3 continued \n \nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n   \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nAt  the  subnational  level,  the  initial  state  of  economic  structure  and  the  pace  of \nstructural transformation differed significantly from province to province.

The remaining provinces \ndisplayed an increasing trend or a U-shaped pattern in terms of the industry share in \nGDP, as represented by Jiangxi and Hubei (Figure 3d). The disastrous effects of the \nGreat Leap Forward (1958\u20131960) can be seen in all provinces. \nAs discussed above, structural changes are usually associated with resource flows.  \nIn  particular,  the  much-publicized  labor  migration  in  the  PRC  has  been  gaining \nmomentum  since  the  mid-1990s,  with  migration  mainly  from  agriculture  to  the \nmanufacturing sector, from rural areas to cities, from small cities to large ones, and \nfrom inland areas to the coast. This unprecedented migration, now in the order of  \n270 million or more, must be driven by the high urban\u2013rural average income ratio  \nand significant wage gaps across industries and locations in the PRC. It is thus not \nsurprising  to  witness,  amid  such  resource  flows  and  structural  transformation, \nsignificant changes in income distribution along all dimensions in the PRC (Wang, \nWan, and Yang 2014; Gustafsson, Li, and Sicular 2010; Wan 2008a and 2008b). \nOne  particular  dimension  of  the  PRC\u2019s  income  distribution  that  has  received \nconsiderable attention is regional inequality (Wan 2006 and 2007; Wan, Lu, and Chen \n2007). Since different regions possess different endowments of resources, which also \ngenerate  different  returns  in  different  sectors  or  locations,  increases  in  regional \ninequality are not unexpected, as confirmed by Wan (2004 and 2007) among others. \nFigure 4 plots regional inequalities in per capita total GDP, as well as in sector per \ncapita GDP, using the Gini coefficient as the measure of inequality. \nFigure 4: Gini Estimates of per Capita Total GDP and Sector GDPs \n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n   \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nSeparating into pre- and post-reform periods (before and after 1978), overall regional \ninequality seems to have exhibited trendless fluctuations in the pre-reform period if  \nthe spike around 1960 is excluded. The spike in the 3 disastrous years of 1958\u20131960 \ncan be attributed to the Great Leap Forward campaign, coupled with natural disasters. \nThe infamous campaign aimed at \u201csurpassing Britain and the United States\u201d in terms of \nindustrialization, which led to the sharp rise in the share of the secondary industry from \n31.3% in 1957 to 39.9% in 1958, and 46.3% and 51.8% respectively in 1959 and 1960 \nbefore dropping back to 37.8% in 1961. Meanwhile, the natural disasters negatively \nimpacted  on the farming  sector  with  GDP  share  of the  primary  industry  dropping  \nfrom 43.2% in 1957 to 36.8%, 29.7%, and 24.5% in 1958\u20131960 before recovering to  \n35.0%  in  1961  (cf.  Figure  3).  These  structural  changes  are  most  dramatic  over  \nthe entire sample period, causing the largest changes in regional inequality in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic era (see Figure 7 and related discussions). In passing, it is noted \nthat the spike mainly came from the contribution of the secondary industry (Figure 6). \nLeaving the spike aside, pre-reform regional inequality fluctuated within a small interval \nof (0.21, 0.26). The next pre-reform peak occurred in 1974, with a Gini value almost \nidentical to those in 1953 and 1954. The pre-reform trough occurred in 1967 with a Gini \nvalue of 0.21. \nThe post-reform period saw a generally rising trend in regional inequality until recently. \nIts  early  decline  from  1978  to  the  mid-1980s  can  be  attributed  to  the  household \nproduction responsibility system and increases in the procurement prices for grains, \nwhich helped narrow the urban\u2013rural gap, which constitutes no less than 50% of total \nregional inequality in the PRC (Wan 2007). When reform focus was shifted to the urban \nsector in the mid-1980s, regional inequality began to rise, again due largely to the \nrising urban\u2013rural gap. The sudden dip in 1990 could be partly attributable to the \nausterity policies implemented over 1989\u20131990. As Wan (2001) discovered, inequality \nin the PRC tends to drop during economic downturns, which may have also contributed \nto the inequality decline in recent years. The sharp increases in the mid-1990s followed \nthe major taxation system reform of 1994, which provides rich (poor) regions with more \n(less) revenues for local redistribution and spending. The recent reductions since 2004 \nhave been encouraging. But it is not clear whether these declines represent a short-\nterm fluctuation like that in the early 1980s or a long-term trend as predicted by the \nKuznets hypothesis (see the end of section 4.3 for more discussion).  \nThe  empirical  results  of  this  subsection  help  confirm  the  theoretical  prediction  of \nsection  2  in  the  sense  that  structural  change  in  the  PRC  characterized  by \nindustrialization was found to be accompanied by rising inequality until the early 2000s. \nAs the PRC completes its industrialization process, inequality has begun to decline.  \n4.2  Economic Structure and Regional Inequality  \nNext, we discuss sector contributions to total inequality and identify which sector drives \nincome distribution. Figure 4 indicates that the primary sector (sector 1) is the most \nevenly distributed across regions, especially from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s. \nUnlike in the primary industry, which has shown a linearly rising trend since 2003, \ninequality in the service sector (sector 3) had been growing continuously until 2007, \nwhen it began to drop. The secondary industry has always been converging over time, \nparticularly since 2003. Manufacturing (sector 2) had been the most unequal sector \nuntil 2005, when the service industry became the most dispersed sector. \n   \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nFurther examination of Figure 4 reveals that total inequality closely correlated with that \nof the secondary industry until the mid-1980s. Since then, manufacturing inequality as \nindicated by its Gini coefficient has continued to decline against the rising trend of \noverall inequality. On the other hand, service sector inequality exhibited a trend that is \nremarkably similar to that of overall inequality except for the unusual 3-disastrous-years \nperiod.  This  co-movement  is  a  little  surprising  as  the  PRC  economy  has  been \ndominated by manufacturing for a long time. Note that the service sector\u2019s share of the \neconomy will increase further largely at the expense of the secondary industry. In \naddition, while the secondary industry has always been converging, the service sector \nhas been diverging since the early 1980s and the rate of increase in the divergence \nonly moderated a little in recent years. \nThe above findings provide evidence to support the first regularity we postulated at the \nbeginning of this section that the inequality of a sector is related to its growth status. \nFor example, the correlation between manufacturing inequality and total inequality is \nhigh initially but gradually declines over time. Meanwhile, the service sector begins to \nplay an increasingly dominant role in driving total inequality. If such correlations imply \nany causal mechanism, further rise in regional inequality may be under way once the \nconvergence of the secondary sector reaches its stable state. These findings point to a \ncautious inequality scenario for the PRC as future growth will inevitably come with the \nexpansion of the service sector, as indicated in Figure 3a. \nNow, attention is turned to examining whether the manufacturing sector is inequality-\nincreasing  first  and  then  inequality-decreasing.  As  discussed  earlier,  whenever  a  \nsector concentration index is greater than the total GDP Gini, it is inequality-increasing, \nand vice versa. Figure 5 plots the sector concentration indices along with the total GDP \nGini estimates. All estimates of the concentration indices are positive except those  \nfor the primary industry in 2007\u20132012. In other words, with a few exceptions all GDP \ncomponents are positively correlated with total per capita GDP, thus richer regions tend \nto possess higher per capita GDP in all sectors. \nConforming to the first regularity, the primary industry is found to be always equalizing. \nConcentration of the primary sector has been low and declining over time. Its decline \nhas accelerated since the mid-1990s, with the concentration index dropping below \n0 from 2007. This is likely to have been caused by the abolition of agriculture taxes in \n2006,  for  the  first  time  in  the  PRC\u2019s  long  history.  Increasing  government  support  \nto grain producers who are more likely to be poor may have also played a role. Also \nconforming  to  the  first  regularity,  the  tertiary  industry  (sector  3)  has  always  been  \ndis-equalizing, with the only exception of the 3-disastrous-years period of 1959\u20131961. \nUnlike  the  other  two  sectors,  the  service  industry  has  been  diverging  since  the  \nearly 1980s (Figures 4 and 5). This divergence, reinforced by the industry\u2019s rising  \nGDP share, completely accounted for the increases in regional inequality from the  \nmid-1990s to the mid-2000s (see Figure 6 and related discussions below).  \nMore interestingly, the manufacturing sector had been inequality-increasing until 2009. \nBut there is a declining trend in both its Gini (Figure 4) and its concentration indices \n(Figure 5), particularly from 2003 onward. This, once again, confirms the first regularity \ndiscussed above. The causes of such a convergence in the secondary industry are \nworth future research. One possibility lies in industrial relocation, driven by improved \ninfrastructure  and  a  rapid  rise  in  production  costs  in  coastal  areas.  If  this  is  the  \ncase, the recently emerging equalizing effect of the secondary industry is expected  \nto continue into the future. However, Lu and Xiang (2014) argued that the convergence \nmay be a result of government interventions and thus may not be sustainable.  \n   \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nFigure 5: Sector Concentration Indices and the Total GDP Gini \n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \nContrasting Figures 4 and 5 reveals that for the service or the secondary industry,  \nits Gini  and  concentration  indices  share  a  similar  trend,  even  with  similar  values.  \nThe  correlation  coefficients  between  these  two  indices  are  as  high  as  0.997  for  \nthe manufacturing sector and 0.978 for the service sector. These imply that richer \nprovinces have higher per capita GDPs from the nonfarming sectors. The primary \nindustry\u2019s Gini and concentration indexes resembled each other until the late 1990s, \nbut their trends have diverged in the last 10 years or so. The two indexes  were \npositively correlated only until 1994, with a correlation coefficient 0.942. Adding the \nremaining later observations, the correlation coefficient drops to 0.198. For the latest \nperiod of 1995\u20132012, the correlation coefficient becomes \u20130.869. These results imply \nthat per capita agriculture GDP has been higher in poorer regions only in recent years.  \nTo obtain sector contributions to total inequality, equation (3.4) is applied to provincial \npopulation and sector GDP data2, available from National Bureau of Statistics (various \nyears). The results are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6 demonstrates that throughout the \nsample  period,  the  secondary  industry  has  played  a  dominant  role  in  constituting \nregional inequality. Until the early 1990s, more than half of total regional inequality can \nbe accounted for by the uneven development of the secondary industry. This is in line \nwith popular perception. But what is unknown to many is the finding that the tertiary \nsector\u2019s contribution has been rising since the early 1980s, particularly after the mid-\n1990s. By the mid-2000s, rather surprisingly, it overtook the secondary industry as the \nmost important contributor to regional inequality. In fact, all increases in total regional \ninequality from 1994 until 2003 came from the tertiary sector. On the other hand, most \nof the decreases in total regional inequality after 2004 came from the secondary, not \nthe tertiary, industry. These empirical findings corroborate well with the two regularities \nand prediction of our theoretical model. \n   \n                                                \n2  Inequality is usually measured in terms of per capita income or consumption. However, only GDP data \npermit breakdowns into sector components for analyzing the structural effects. Income data by sectors \nor industries are not available. In any case, regional inequality based on GDP data shares the same \ntrend as those based on income or consumption data (Wang, Wan, and Yang 2014).  \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nAs the concentration index of the service sector remains high (Figure 5), and its GDP \nshare is expected to continue to rise, uneven development of the tertiary industry must \nreceive priority consideration in the fight against regional inequality. On the other hand, \nthe concentration index of the primary industry GDP has consistently been small and \nmoved into negative territory as of 2007 (Figure 5) and its GDP share has been below \n10% since 2009 (Figure 3a). Therefore, the contribution of the primary industry to \nregional inequality must be small and becoming negligible over time, as confirmed  \nby Figure 6. \nFigure 6: Sector Contributions to Regional Inequality \n \nNote: On the y-axis, the Gini coefficient is shown. \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n \n4.3  Accounting for Changes in Regional Inequality: The Role  \nof Structural Transformation \nTo account for inequality changes, equation (3.9) is applied to the PRC data. The \ndecomposition results, as shown in Figure 7, demonstrate that the secondary industry \nhas dominated not only the contributions to the level of total regional inequality, but \nalso the contributions to changes in total inequality. In particular, the spike in the Great \nLeap Forward period is clearly attributable to the secondary industry. The contributions \nof the primary sector to inequality changes were visible in the pre-reform period but \ndiminished over time and largely disappeared after 1990. The role of the service sector \nin driving inequality changes became more visible from the mid-1980s. However, this \nrole lost significance in the last 7 years when total inequality declined, despite its rising \nand dominant contributions to total inequality (cf. Figure 6). \nIt is commonly accepted that year-to-year changes in inequality are typically small. \nHowever, our results demonstrate that small changes can accumulate rather quickly. \nThere are four major peaks in total regional inequality in the PRC, appearing in 1960, \n1974, 1994, and 2003. The first three were formed by only 2\u20133 years of successive \nsmall rises. The 2003 peak was preceded by 7 years of even smaller increases. More \ninterestingly, the significant decline in regional inequality since 2004 is caused by \n7 years of consecutive small decreases. \n   \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nFigure 7: Sector Contributions to Changes in Regional Inequality \n \nNote: On the y-axis, the Gini coefficient is shown. \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \nFigure 8 shows the structural and concentration effects. It is interesting to observe  \nthe following: (i) Out of a total of 60 years, 49 years saw positive structural effects, \nmeaning  inequality-increasing.  This  finding  confirms  the  theoretical  postulation \ndiscussed in section 2 of this paper: structural change brings about inequality, making \nsome people gain more while others gain less or even lose. (ii) Out of a total of \n60 years, 34 years saw negative concentration effects. During 1968\u20131971, 1975\u20131981, \nand 2004\u20132012, they were successively negative and during 1991\u20131994 successively \npositive. No systematic pattern can be detected in other years. (iii) Prior to 2004, \nstructural effects mostly co-moved with changes in total regional inequality, implying \nthat regional inequality can be largely attributable to structural effects. For example, \n1983  marks  the  year  of  division  between  decreasing  and  then  increasing  total \ninequality. And in the same year, we saw the negative and then positive values of the \nstructural effects. (iv) There is a clear converging trend in the structural effects\u2014the \nfluctuations becoming smaller over time, corresponding well with gradual movement \ntoward completion of the industrialization process. This is better seen in Figure 9, \nwhich plots the cumulative structural and concentration effects. \nFigure 8: Structural Effects and Concentration Effects of Inequality Changes \n \nNote: On the y-axis, the Gini coefficient is shown. \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nUntil 1972, the structural and concentration effects seemed to reinforce each other, \nwith a 1-year lag or lead sometimes. They became offsetting to each other during \n1973\u20131985. From 1985 to 2003, they were weakly but positively correlated. No obvious \ncorrelation can be found in the post-2003 period, when structural effects diminished to \n0 while the concentration effects turned negative with a declining trend. \nFigure 9 plots the cumulate structural and concentration effects, confirming that the \nstructural effects were mostly positive. Up to the period of the Great Leap Forward, \ntheir absolute values were larger than those of the concentration effects. From 1961 to \n1994, structural effects took alternate signs and their magnitude became small, smaller \nthan the corresponding concentration effects in a majority of years, particularly after \n1985.  Since  1994,  the structural  effects  have always  been  positive  with  only  one \nexception,  but  their  values  have  gradually  converged  to  zero.  During  2007\u20132012, \nstructural effects can be hardly seen at all (Figure 8). But, in contrast to the diminishing \nstructural  effects  over  time,  the  concentration  effects  were  relatively  large  from  \nabout 1982 onward and became dominant after 2006. These results help verify our \ntheoretical model. \nFigure 9: Cumulative Structural and Concentration Effects \n \nNote: On the y-axis, the Gini coefficient is shown. \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \nWhich effects, the structural or concentration effects, are more important? Figure 8 \nindicates that the concentration effects in absolute terms are larger most of the time. \nFurther, Figure 9 shows that in more recent years, they drove the decline in total \nregional inequality (section 4.4). Thus, it can be concluded that concentration effects \nbasically dominated the regional inequality profile in the PRC. As mentioned previously, \nstructural effects, by definition, are indispensable to growth and they form part of the \ngrowth regularity. Fortunately, the structural effects are converging to 0, corroborating \nthe  observation  that  the  industrialization  phase  of  structural  transformation  is \napproaching completion in the PRC. This is consistent with the very hypothesis that \nmotivated this paper. \n   \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \n4.4  Modeling the Structural Effects \nTo  formally  verify  regularities  2  and  3,  we  conduct  regression  analysis  in  this \nsubsection.

To provide more insight, the structural and \nconcentration  effects  are  disaggregated  by  sectors.  The  results  are  tabulated  in \nTable 3 (with percentage contributions adding up to 100). It is clear that the declines \nare basically driven by significant reductions in industry concentrations, particularly that  \nof the secondary industry and to some extent that of the service industry. If one  \nadds up these two reductions, the combined contribution accounts for at least 85% of \neach of the declines in regional inequality over the period 2006\u20132012. Conversely, the \nstructural effects are mostly inequality-increasing but they are all quite small. What \ndrives the convergences in industry concentration is a question worth further research, \nbut industry relocation and increasing flows of foreign direct investment to the inland \nprovinces over the last few years are part of the explanation. \nTable 3: Recent Declines in Regional Inequality: Decomposition Results (%) \nConcentration Effects  Structural Effects \n \nFrom  To  Sector 1  Sector 2  Sector 3  Sector 1  Sector 2  Sector 3  Sum \n2005  2006  \u201327.57  \u2013206.57  38.02  \u20135.09  85.84  15.37  \u2013100 \n2006  2007  \u201317.44  \u201383.98  \u20134.54  \u20130.09  \u20134.15  10.18  \u2013100 \n2007  2008  \u20138.00  \u201383.77  \u201311.51  0.10  12.53  \u20139.35  \u2013100 \n2008  2009  9.71  \u201393.12  \u201346.32  0.57  \u201341.66  70.83  \u2013100 \n2009  2010  \u20135.43  \u201398.12  \u20130.24  0.26  20.16  \u201316.63  \u2013100 \n2010  2011  \u20134.14  \u201370.40  \u201328.15  0.20  3.26  \u20130.76  \u2013100 \n2011  2012  0.72  \u201360.39  \u201351.09  0.04  \u201324.28  35.00  \u2013100 \nSource: Authors\u2019 computation based on National Bureau of Statistics (various years). \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \n5.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION \nThis  paper  postulates  that  structural  changes  triggered  by  technological  (e.g., \nemergences of information and communication technology and e-commerce), cultural \n(e.g., rising demand for health food), institutional (e.g., the PRC\u2019s reform and opening \nup), or policy (e.g., a privatization move) shocks bring about resource reallocation \nacross sectors and locations, leading to disequilibriums in factor demand and supply \nand thus causing changes in income inequality. As structural transformation slows \ndown or approaches its completion, equilibriums tend to be restored and inequality \ntends to decline. We construct a model to characterize this process, demonstrating \nrelationship of inverted U shape between inequality and structural transformation. Our \ntheoretical model is different from the famous Kuznets hypothesis as Kuznets (1955) \nfocused on the growth\u2013inequality relationship, which was not formalized either. It is \nalso  different  from  the  convergence  or  catch-up  literature,  including  Caselli  and \nColeman (2001). \nDecomposition frameworks are then developed to account for the level of inequality \nand for the changes in the level of inequality. A change in inequality can be attributed \nto  structural  transformation  (called  structural  effect)  and  variation  in  concentration \nindexes (called concentration effect). According to our theoretical model, the structural \neffects are expected to be positively correlated with structural transformation and tend \nto disappear when the latter approaches completion. These theoretical predictions are \nconfirmed by empirical evidence from the PRC. \nApplying the decomposition technique to PRC data yields several fresh, interesting, \nand important findings. First of all, the structural effects mostly co-moved with changes \nin total regional equality before 2004. But it has recently converged to 0, confirming our \ntheoretical postulation that motivated this paper. Conversely, the concentration effects \nbecame relatively large after 1982 and became dominant after 2006. \nSecond, the primary industry has always been equalizing while the tertiary industry  \nhas always been dis-equalizing except the unusual 3-year period of 1959\u20131961. The \nmanufacturing sector had accounted for more than half of the total regional inequality \nuntil the early 1990s and had been dis-equalizing until 2009. It also dominated sectoral \ncontributions  to  inequality  changes.  But  this  important  sector  has  always  been \nconverging spatially, particularly after 2003. \nThird, the service industry has been spatially diverging since the early 1980s. By the \nmid-2000s, it overtook the secondary industry as the most important contributor to \nregional inequality. In fact, all increases in total regional inequality from 1994 until 2003 \ncame from the tertiary sector. In addition, total regional inequality has closely co-moved \nwith that of the service sector since 1966. Because its GDP share will rise further, \ncoupled with a high concentration index, uneven development of the tertiary industry \nmust receive priority consideration in the fight against regional inequality in the future, \nespecially when the secondary sector converges to its stable state.  \nFinally, the structural and concentration effects are found to reinforce each other until \n1972. They became offsetting to each other during 1973\u20131985. From 1985 to 2003, \nthey are weakly but positively correlated. Little correlation can be found after 2003 \nwhen structural effects diminished to 0 while the concentration effects turned negative \nwith a declining trend. \n   \n26 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nThese findings have profound implications for the PRC. Fast-rising inequality in the \nPRC has largely been driven by structural transformation, which is indispensable to \ngrowth and forms part of the growth regularity. But the structural effects have basically \ndisappeared and the concentration effects are becoming dominant. Looking forward, \nthe poorer inland areas in the PRC possess comparative advantages in producing \nagricultural  and  mining  products.  As  the  share  of  the  equalizing  primary  industry \ndiminishes (see Figure 4 and its related discussion), regional inequality is likely to rise. \nOn the other hand, services are less tradable than commodities, thus the location \nadvantage of coastal regions in manufactured exports is expected to decline as the \nGDP share of the tertiary sector rises. Consequently, regional inequality may decrease \nor increase as the PRC continues to transform from a manufacturing-dominant to a \nservice-dominant economy, partly depending on the emerging structural effects that will \nbe driven by the increasing dominance of the service sector. Thus, it is important to \nsupport the development of the tertiary sector in the lagging areas so as to alleviate the \npotentially rising concentration effects. \n   \n27 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 608  Wan, Wang, and Zhang \n \nREFERENCES \nCaselli, F., and W.
