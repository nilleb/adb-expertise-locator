In\naddition, there are large intercountry differences in the extent to which social ser-\nvices, especially health and education, reach the poor. There is no simple explana-\ntion for these disparities. However, they do demonstrate that poverty is the out-\ncome not only of economic phenomena but also of social and political processes and\nhow  these  interact  with  each  other.  Mediating  these  interactions  is  a  variety  of\ninstitutions that are important to understanding poverty and  devising needed poli-\ncies. Institutions affect poverty both directly and indirectly via a number of mediat-\ning  factors.  Institutions  influence  government  policies,  which  in  turn  influence\ngrowth and distributional outcomes, which then affect the pace of poverty reduc-\ntion. In addition, institutions directly influence the pace and quality of economic\ngrowth. Then, of course, government policies affect institutions as well.  The impact\nof  institutions\u2014whether  political,  social,  cultural  or  administrative\u2014on  poverty\nreduction is thus pervasive. This paper examines the effects of institutions on pov-\nerty reduction and the pathways through which these effects operate.\n\n71\n\n\fI. Introduction\n\nA main feature of Asia\u2019s success story is the remarkable social transformation and poverty\n\nreduction that have accompanied the region\u2019s rapid economic growth.  Some three decades\nago, more than half the region was poor, just two of five adults were literate, and the\naverage person could hope to live only 48 years.  At present, the proportion of poor people is down\nto one third, 70 percent of adults are literate, and life expectancy is up to 68 years.  And while\nthe region\u2019s population has increased from 1.8 billion to 3.0 billion, the number of poor people\nhas dropped from more than 1 billion to below 900 million.\n\nHowever, because Asia is so vast and diverse, its success story is not equally applicable to\nall  economies.  There  are  large  disparities  in  economic  and  social  progress  between  and  within\ncountries in the region. The contrast between the economies in South Asia and those in East and\nSoutheast Asia is sharp. Even the more dynamic East and Southeast Asia have suffered some\nsetbacks, including increases in transient poverty in the countries hardest hit by the recent Asian\nfinancial crisis.\n\nSome countries have, wittingly or unwittingly, adopted more pro-poor economic growth\nstrategies than others, and with remarkable success. What the key policy ingredients are of such\ngrowth, and what factors apart from economic growth differences account for the differential progress\nin social development and poverty reduction across Asian developing countries, remain challeng-\ning questions.\n\nA.\n\nPoverty Reduction in Asia\n\nThe extent and seriousness of poverty vary markedly across Asian developing countries\n(ADCs). For example, using national definitions, poverty incidence ranges from a low of 6 percent\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to a high of 53 percent in Bangladesh (Table 1); or using\nthe international definition of a dollar a day, poverty varies from less than 2 percent in Thailand\nand Kazakhstan to as high as 50.3 percent in Nepal (David et al. 1999). Likewise, the extent to\nwhich poverty has fallen over time also varies substantially across Asia. In South Asia, for in-\nstance, poverty incidence barely changed between 1987 and 1996, falling from 44.9 to 42.3 percent.\nIn contrast, the incidence of poverty in East Asia fell from 26.6 percent in 1987 to 14.9 percent in\n1996 (World Bank 2000a).\n\n1\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nIn addition, there are large intercountry differences in the extent to which social services,\nespecially health and education, reach the poor. For example, some countries, such as Sri Lanka,\nhave been much more successful than other countries, such as Pakistan, in targeting social ser-\nvices and subsidies to the poor (Streeten 1995).\n\nThere is no single explanation for these disparities. Some speculate that the diversity of\nexperience stems from cross-country variations in geographical characteristics, natural resource\nendowments, demographic trends, and urbanization rates (UN-ESCAP 1998, ADB 1999b, World\nBank 1997). However, these demonstrate that poverty is the outcome not only of economic pro-\ncesses but also of social and political phenomena and how these interact with each other. Mediat-\ning these interactions is a variety of institutions that are important to understanding poverty and\nto devising needed policies. Thus, while economic growth is widely recognized to be the principal\nengine that promotes poverty reduction and improvements in people\u2019s living standards, it alone\ncannot fully explain the intercountry differences in achievements made in poverty reduction. In\naddition, of course, the adoption of policies that promote rapid economic growth is itself influenced\nby social, political, and institutional processes.\n\nAccelerating the progress in poverty reduction requires a strategy that, in addition to pro-\nmoting rapid economic growth, will address the other determinants as well, including institutions\nand other factors. For instance, removing institutional and policy constraints can make economic\ngrowth pro-poor. The new poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopts\na comprehensive approach and recognizes this concern: \u201cSince poverty causes and characteristics\ndiffer from country to country, the starting point must be a comprehensive examination of the\nconstraints and opportunities for poverty reduction in each country. This will require understand-\ning the nature, intensity, and spread of poverty; the distributional effects of macroeconomic poli-\ncies; the focus and efficiency of public expenditures; and the effectiveness of government programs\nand institutions\u201d (ADB 1999a, 15).\n\nB.\n\nWhat are Institutions?\n\nThis paper adopts a somewhat broad definition of institutions as \u201c\u2026 the humanly-devised\nconstraints that structure political, economic and social interactions\u201d (North 1991, 97). Institu-\ntions include social networks, gender roles, legal system, politico-administrative system, and the\nstate more generally\u2014all of which interact with each other. Institutions are either state or nonstate.\nState institutions cover many aspects, such as the public provision of basic education and health\nservices, public order and safety, and infrastructure. The nature of governance will determine the\navailability  and  quality  of  these  public  services  and,  hence,  the  extent  to  which  the  poor  have\naccess to them.\n\nNonstate institutions are social institutions, values, and norms. A key social institution is\nsocial capital, which consists of informal norms or established relationships that enable people to\npursue objectives and act in concert for common benefit. Social capital is particularly important for\nthe poor. Ethnicity and gender roles, which remain pronounced in Asia and lead to discrimination\nagainst minorities and females, are other institutions that underlie poverty and inequality.\n\n2\n\n\fSection I\nIntroduction\n\nThus, apart from economic growth, various institutions and sociocultural factors can ex-\nplain why some countries have reduced poverty and inequality faster than others, or why in par-\nticular circumstances poverty and inequality are so difficult to tackle. Institutions and policies\ninfluence  all  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy:  pro-poor,  sustainable  economic\ngrowth; social development; and governance. Analyzing the nature of these institutions and poli-\ncies will contribute to a deeper understanding of poverty and pro-poor growth and the formulation\nof more effective country poverty reduction strategies.\n\nThe objective of this paper is to identify and discuss the main institutions that have an\nimpact on poverty reduction, either directly or indirectly via their impact on economic growth. In\naddition, the paper explores the various pathways through which institutions may inhibit or pro-\nmote poverty reduction efforts in a country and examines the impact of institutional policies and\nreforms on poverty reduction.  Some of the questions it tries to address are: to what extent have\ninstitutional constraints inhibited some ADCs from being able to reduce poverty rates as rapidly\nas other ADCs? How can one explain vast intercountry differences in social, cultural, and political\ninstitutions?  Are these differences exogenous, or can they be changed by policy interventions?\nWhat types of institutional reforms can improve the poverty reduction efforts of countries?\n\nC.\n\nContext and Structure of the Paper\n\nThis paper is based on research  that covered six ADCs: Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Pakistan,\nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam; and included two newly industralized economies in Asia,\nRepublic  of  Korea  (Korea)  and  Taipei,China.  The  research  undertook  extensive  reviews  of  the\nliterature; field interviews with key persons from government, academia, and nongovernment or-\nganizations (NGOs); and country case studies (Korea; Philippines; Taipei,China; and Thailand).\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the various analytical approaches to\npoverty  reduction  that  have  evolved  over  the  years,  particularly  the  relative  roles  of  economic\ngrowth, direct poverty alleviation policies, social service provision, institutions, and governance in\noverall poverty reduction.1  Section III is concerned with the political economy of poverty reduc-\ntion. It discusses the importance of political will and commitment to poverty reduction and how\nsuch political will is shaped by interest groups and dominant coalitions. Section IV deals with the\nrole of social and cultural institutions\u2014such as social exclusion, social capital, and civil society\u2014in\npoverty reduction. The fifth section discusses how reform involving public institutions (adminis-\ntrative reforms, decentralization, citizen participation in governance, and improved legal frame-\nwork) can reduce poverty. Section VI concludes with a discussion of policy lessons and implica-\ntions.\n\n1 Throughout  this  paper,  the  terms  \u201cpoverty  reduction\u201d,  \u201cpoverty  alleviation\u201d,  and  \u201cantipoverty\u201d  are  used\n\ninterchangeably.\n\n3\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nTable 1.

Analytical Approaches to Poverty Reduction\n\nA.\n\nThe Evolution of Poverty Strategies\n\nThe policy concern with poverty and income distribution among multilateral organizations\ngoes back as far back as 1970, when the United Nation\u2019s Committee for Development Planning, in\npreparing for the United Nation\u2019s Second Development Decade, declared that \u201c\u2026the efforts needed\nare best characterized by what is sometimes called the necessary \u2018war on poverty\u2019\u201d (United Na-\ntions 1970, 6). The Committee declared poverty reduction through accelerated development, im-\nproved income distribution, and other social changes (including employment, education, health,\nand housing) as the paramount objective of an appropriate international development strategy.\n\nIn  1974,  the  World  Bank  published  a  seminal  volume  on  Redistribution  with  Growth\n(Chenery et al. 1974), which emphasized that policies of wealth redistribution were not only con-\n\n4\n\n\fSection II\nAnalytical Approaches to Poverty Reduction\n\nsistent  with,  but  actually  conducive  to,  growth-promoting  policies.  The  idea  that  there  was  no\ntrade-off between economic growth and the fight against inequality and poverty was relatively\ninnovative, but quickly won acceptance in policy circles.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the International Labor Office (ILO) launched the World Employment\nProgram (WEP), under which a number of studies on income distribution and poverty were under-\ntaken.  Many  of  Sen\u2019s  early  writings  on  the  entitlement-capability  approach  (Sen  1981),  for  in-\nstance, were published under the ILO WEP program.\n\nThe World Bank (1990) took this concern with poverty further by focusing its World Devel-\nopment Report on poverty, which declared that a successful attack on poverty needed to be mounted\nsimultaneously on three fronts: (i) broad-based (labor-intensive) economic growth that generates\nemployment and incomes for the poor; (ii) development of human resources (education, health, and\nnutrition) of the poor, which allows them to better exploit the opportunities created by economic\ngrowth; and (iii) establishment of a social safety net for those among the poor who are unable to\nbenefit from growth and human development opportunities owing to physical and mental disabili-\nties, natural disasters, civil conflict, and physical isolation.\n\nThe ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, although broadly similar, differs from the World\nBank\u2019s in that it explicitly considers the importance of governance. According to the ADB (1999a),\nthe three pillars of a poverty reduction strategy are: (i) pro-poor, sustainable economic growth; (ii)\nsocial development comprising human capital development, social capital, improving the status of\nwomen, and social protection; and (iii) sound macroeconomic management and good governance,\nwhich would be required for successful achievement of the first two pillars.\n\nIn addition, the ADB approach emphasizes the importance of understanding the nexus\nbetween poverty and the environment. Two of the major environmental issues are (i) air and water\npollution in megacities that affects the poor disproportionately (Pernia 1994); and (ii) deforesta-\ntion, natural resource depletion, and land degradation that can deepen poverty (Quibria 1993).\n\nMost  recently,  the  World  Development  Report  2000  has  come  up  with  a  new  analytical\nframework to attack poverty that is built on three pillars: empowerment, security, and opportu-\nnity (World Bank 2000b). Empowerment is the process of enhancing the capacity of poor people to\ninfluence the state institutions that affect their lives, by strengthening their participation in po-\nlitical processes and local decision making. Security is the protection of the poor against adverse\nshocks, both via better management of macroeconomic shocks as well more comprehensive safety\nnets. Opportunity is the process of increasing the access of the poor to physical and human capital\nand increasing the rates of return to these assets.\n\nDespite their superficial differences, the various approaches to poverty alleviation are ac-\ntually very similar. All the approaches emphasize the importance of broad-based, labor-intensive,\nand inclusive growth; good governance and accountability; human and social development; and\nsocial protection and special poverty alleviation policies.\n\nIn recent years, the issue of globalization and poverty has been brought to the forefront.\nProponents of globalization assert that globalization offers enormous opportunities to developing\ncountries through easier access to the world\u2019s knowledge, better technologies for delivering prod-\n\n5\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nucts and services, and expanded markets. Opponents insist that by requiring developing countries\nto lower tariffs and other trade barriers, globalization destroys domestic industries, traditional\ncrafts, and threatens the food security of poor families. A recent review by the Department for\nInternational Development (DFID 2001) points to a few serious concerns, including the fact that\nalthough globalization has an important role in promoting economic prosperity, it has not influ-\nenced the lives of the poor living in remote or inaccessible areas so far. In addition, globalization\nhas also exposed developing countries to systemic risks, as illustrated by the Asian crisis of 1997.\nBut the damaging effects of such crises could be averted through a sound macroeconomic position,\nadequate domestic regulation, and transparency in relationships between companies and banks.\nIn other words, the potential benefits of market reforms and globalization cannot be realized in the\nabsence of an appropriate regulatory framework, and this means that the poor are often subjected\nto acute hardships during the process of liberalization.\n\nMore specific concerns in the context of rural poverty alleviation emerge from the Report\non Rural Poverty by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD 2001). Trade\nliberalization, for example, influences the rural poor in diverse ways. Removing or reducing biases\nagainst farm prices may help food sellers among the rural poor but harm net food buyers. How-\never, access to competitive market channels matters too. If, for example, monopsonistic marketing\nboards are replaced by a private monopsonist, the gains from trade liberalization to smallholders\nmay remain limited. Moreover, supply responses are conditional upon infrastructural support (e.g.,\nroads and communication networks). Finally, trade liberalization is associated with not just higher\nfood crop prices but also higher variances of these prices, especially rice. So, even if smallholders\nbenefit under certain conditions from higher prices, they are also exposed to greater variability of\nfarm incomes.2  Worries over food security add to the already high levels of tension among the poor.\n\nB.\n\nAnalytical Framework\n\nWhat is the nature of the linkages between economic growth, policies, institutions, and\npoverty reduction?  Figure 1 below illustrates how these factors are related to each other, with\nrespect to poverty reduction outcome. Institutions affect poverty both directly and indirectly via a\nnumber of mediating factors.\n\nWhile this paper is basically  concerned with all of the linkages between institutions and\npoverty reduction shown in the above diagram, it gives relatively greater emphasis to the direct,\nrather than the indirect, effects of institutions and institutional policies on poverty.  The reason for\nthis is that there is already a large, three decades-old literature on how political, social, cultural\nand administrative institutions affect economic growth and income distribution in a country via its\nchoice of macroeconomic and trade policies, such as outward orientation, financial liberalization,\nexchange rate flexibility, macroeconomic stability, and labor market flexibility (see, for example,\nLittle et al. 1970).\n\n2 For illustrations, see Lustig and Stern (2000) and Gaiha (2000a).\n\n6\n\n\fSection II\nAnalytical Approaches to Poverty Reduction\n\nFigure 1. The Relationship between Institutions, Economic Growth,\nand Poverty Reduction\n\nInstitutions\n\nPolicies\n\nEconomic\nGrowth\n\nDistribution\n\nPro-poor\nGrowth\n\nPoverty\nReduction\n\nC.\n\nPro-poor Growth\n\nIn the last few years, there has been increasing interest on the question of whether the\npoor relative to other segments of society, share the benefits of growth proportionally. One strand\nof  literature  analyzes  the  cross-country  relationship  between  economic  growth  and    per  capita\nincome of individuals in the first quintile of the distribution (i.e., the relative poor). Using essen-\ntially the same data and similar econometric techniques, Roemer and Gugerty (1997), Gallup et al.\n(1999), and Dollar and Kraay (2000) estimate the growth elasticity of per capita incomes of the\n\u201cpoor\u201d to be practically one, implying that growth in average income leads to a one-for-one increase\nin the incomes of the poor. However, Timmer (1997) obtains an elasticity of around 0.8, indicating\nless-than-proportionate gains for the poor from economic growth.\n\nThe second strand of literature has examined the effect of economic growth on absolute\npoverty. Ravallion (2000), Ravallion and Chen (1997), and Bruno et al. (1998) find that the elastic-\nity of the poverty headcount ratio is typically greater than two, viz., that when average income\nincreases by 10 percent, the proportion of poor declines by more than 20 percent. Other studies\nsuch as Morley (2000), De Janvry and Sadoulet (2000), and Smolensky et al. (1994) report a smaller\nelasticity of around one percent, but these are obtained from a smaller sample of countries. Ravallion\nand Chen (1997) also use poverty lines that combine an absolute and a relative component, but\ntheir elasticities are highly sensitive to where the poverty line is located. They estimate an elastic-\n\n7\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nity of poverty ranging from -2.6 to -0.7, depending on whether the threshold is established at 50 or\n100 percent of the average income observed at the initial period of observation.\n\nThe above discussion ignores the fact that the relationship between growth and poverty is\nhighly country-specific; the \u201caverage\u201d elasticity estimated by various studies is unlikely to capture\nthe wide range of country experiences. In some countries, economic growth has been associated\nwith  rapid  poverty  reduction,  while  in  others  it  has  not.  Even  in  a  given  country,  growth  can\nsharply reduce poverty at one point in time and can have a much smaller effect on poverty reduc-\ntion during another time period.3\n\nIt is in this context that the term \u201cpro-poor growth\u201d is often used. Pro-poor growth, which\ncan be distinguished from \u201ctrickle-down\u201d growth, is economic growth that is explicitly biased in\nfavor of the poor so that they benefit more than proportionately relative to the nonpoor. Obviously,\npro-poor growth is possible only under an enabling environment in which poor households can\nrapidly increase their production, income, and earnings. Since the most important asset\u2014often\nthe only asset\u2014that the poor possess is their own labor, labor-intensive development projects tend\nto be pro-poor.\n\nKakwani and Pernia (2001) define a pro-poor growth index that compares the actual reduc-\ntion  in  poverty  due  to  growth  with  the  reduction  in  poverty  that  might  have  occurred  with  no\nchange in inequality. Using this definition, they find that during the 1990s, growth in Korea was\nsignificantly more pro-poor than growth in Thailand and Lao PDR. However, growth in Thailand\nbecame progressively more pro-poor over time. Further, growth in rural areas is more pro-poor\nthan growth in urban areas.4\n\nD.\n\nRole of Direct Poverty Alleviation Policies\n\nObviously, no one would argue that growth is all that is needed to improve the lives of the\npoor. Many developing and developed countries have supplemented macroeconomic growth with\ndirect antipoverty interventions. Such interventions include land reforms, micro credit, and public\nemployment schemes. Land reforms are critically important in less industrialized countries, as\naccess to land is an important source of livelihood in the rural areas. Moreover, to the extent that\nmany  empirical  studies  have  shown  smallholders  to  be  more  efficient  users  of  land  than  large\nlandholders, and sharecropping to be inefficient vis-\u00e0-vis owner-operated cultivation (Shaban 1987,\nBinswanger et al. 1995, Otsuka 2000, Ravallion and Sen 1994), implementation of land reforms\n\n3 Further, economic growth, like antipoverty interventions, can benefit the higher strata among the poor, but\n\nhave little impact on the poorest of the poor.\n\n4 Timmer (1997) also touches upon this issue.  He finds that in countries in which the income gap between the\npoor and the rich is relatively small, growth of labor productivity in agriculture has larger positive effects on\nthe incomes of each quintile than the growth of nonagricultural productivity.  But in countries with large income\ngaps, growth in agricultural productivity is no more effective than nonagricultural productivity in alleviating\npoverty.  Not surprisingly, the rich in these countries benefit substantially from agricultural growth, presumably\nbecause of highly skewed land distribution.\n\n8\n\n\fSection II\nAnalytical Approaches to Poverty Reduction\n\nmay pose no trade-offs between equity and efficiency.5   Land reform is also said to give a \u201cvoice\u201d to\nlandless workers and sharecropping tenants (who tend to be the poorest groups in most countries)\nthrough greater participation in local institutions.6\n\nSpecial  employment  schemes  have  also  figured  prominently  in  poverty  alleviation  pro-\ngrams of many Asian ADCs. The two most common types are self-employment creation schemes\nand wage-employment schemes.\n\nMost self-employment creation schemes seek to place income-generating assets, such as\nmilk cows, power looms, small retail stores, or street-hawking equipment, in the hands of the poor,\ntypically by providing them with access to credit and other forms of marketing assistance. A good\nexample is India\u2019s Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP), that offers subsidized credit to\nthe poor for purchase of income-generating assets. Dubbed as one of the largest self-employment\nschemes in the world, the IRDP benefits nearly one third of all rural poor households in India\n(Bandopadhyaya  1985).  Indonesia  has  also  had  two  similar  schemes  with  very  wide  coverage,\nKupedes and Badan Kredit Kecamatan (BKK). The BKK serves more than 35 percent of Java\u2019s\n8,500  villages  (World  Bank  1990).  Another  well-known  self-employment  creation  (microcredit)\nscheme is the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh (Khandker 1998).\n\nWage employment schemes provide wage labor opportunities, typically on public works\nprojects, to the poor. These schemes have long been used in many developing countries in emer-\ngency situations, such as during periods of famine and drought and, more recently, during periods\nof macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment, when there is large-scale, transitory unemploy-\nment and underemployment in the rural sector. However, in recent times, many developing coun-\ntries have incorporated such schemes as regular elements of an antipoverty strategy. In South\nAsia particularly, wage employment schemes in the form of rural works have formed the core of\ngovernment  antipoverty  strategies.  For  instance,  the  Government  of  India  operates  a  national\nwage employment scheme based on public works projects, the National Rural Employment Pro-\ngram (NREP). Another well-known scheme is the Employment Guarantee Scheme in the Indian\nstate of Maharashtra. In the Philippines, in the mid-1960s, a pump-priming program that cen-\ntered around construction of roads and other infrastructure was implemented to generate employ-\nment in the countryside. Again, in 1986, the Aquino government launched the Community Em-\nployment Development Program, which also focused on building farm-to-market roads and other\nsimilar infrastructure as part of the rural job creation scheme.\n\n5 In a somewhat qualified endorsement of land redistribution, Banerjee (2000) does not dispute the efficiency\nand equity gains. However, given that all forms of redistribution cost money as well as bureaucratic and political\ncapital, it is unclear whether redistributing land is the best way to redress inequality.\n\n6 From the perspective of broadening the constituency for antipoverty interventions, Herring (2000, 31) observes,\n\u201cWhether policy promotes more or less state intervention, agrarian reform remains a means of restructuring\nthe field of power to which state functionaries respond, and therefore enables more possibilities for building\nan effective and responsive state, without which all other antipoverty options including growth are reduced\nin efficacy.\u201d\n\n9\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nWhich of the three sets of policies\u2014land reform, micro credit, or public employment pro-\ngrams\u2014is  likely  to  be  most  effective  in  reducing  poverty?    A  combination  of  all  three  policies\ntypically will be more effective than any single policy, as each addresses different aspects of pov-\nerty (e.g., chronic versus transitory poverty). However, it is important to note that direct poverty\nalleviation policies alone are unlikely to result in sustained poverty decline. What is needed is a\ncombination of pro-poor economic growth and direct poverty interventions.\n\nA study that compared the distribution of beneficiaries in two antipoverty programs in the\nIndian  state  of  Maharashtra,  namely  a  credit  scheme  (viz.,  the  Integrated  Rural  Development\nProgram) and a workfare scheme (the Employment Guarantee Scheme) found that the workfare\nscheme was well-targeted to the poor. Participation in the scheme declined with economic status\n(Ravallion and Datt 1995). In contrast, participation in the credit scheme had virtually no relation-\nship with the economic status of beneficiaries (Figure 2). This may be because a large number of\nindividuals misrepresented their incomes to qualify for subsidized loans, or there was widespread\ncorruption in program administration.\n\nA few studies have drawn attention to the disincentive effects of direct antipoverty inter-\nventions. In the context of rural public works, for instance, it has been argued that it may discour-\nage job search and investment in income-augmenting skills (Besley and Coate 1992). Food subsi-\ndies in Sri Lanka have been associated with a reduction in labor supply and work effort (Sahn and\nAlderman 1995). Another study for South Africa found that public pension support provided to\nparents of migrant workers significantly decreased the remittances from migrant children (Jensen\n1998). If these effects are confirmed through detailed empirical analyses, their implications for the\ncost-effectiveness of antipoverty interventions can be serious. An important issue then is whether\nincentive-compatible designs of such interventions are feasible.\n\nFigure 2.

Not only are basic levels of\nhealth and education a right of the poor, they are also important in accelerating poverty reduction,\nas they allow the poor to take advantage of the opportunities created by economic growth.7   But in\nmany countries, the poor have less physical (geographical) and economic access to education and\nhealth services than the nonpoor, resulting in lower rates of utilization and hence worse health\nand literacy outcomes. There is thus a vicious circle of poverty leading to ill health, malnutrition,\nand illiteracy, which in turn perpetuate poverty.\n\nThe physical remoteness of the poor from public facilities, such as hospitals, health centers\nand  schools,  can  often  get  exacerbated  with  community  financing  of  public  schools  and  health\ncenters. Since richer communities are better able to raise matching funds for public investments,\nthey are more likely to receive public facilities. Studies in such countries as Viet Nam and Cambo-\ndia have shown that average distances to secondary schools and higher-level health care (viz.,\npolyclinics and hospitals) are significantly greater for the poor than for the nonpoor (Pradhan and\nPrescott 1998, World Bank 1999).\n\nEven  if  geographical  access  to  social  services  were  the  same  for  both  the  poor  and  the\nnonpoor, as in urban areas, the high cost of obtaining these services would serve as a significant\ndeterrent to their use by the poor. Although many publicly provided services, such as health care\nand schooling, are supposedly available free of charge to the poor, the fact is that these services are\nrarely obtained without some form of payment. There are typically charges for drugs, textbooks,\nand supplies. In addition, public providers frequently extract informal payments to provide such\n\u201cfree\u201d public services.\n\nF.\n\nInstitutional Factors and Governance\n\nSocial, cultural and institutional factors are pervasive in their influence on poverty reduc-\ntion\u2014both directly as well as via their influence on growth, direct poverty alleviation policies, and\nprovision of basic social services. For example, political exclusion can result in some groups not\nperceived to be politically important being denied access to publicly provided social services and\npoverty reduction programs. Agricultural growth can be less pro-poor because of the institutional\nproblems of legislating and implementing effective land reform. In addition, sociocultural taboos\nand beliefs can result in some groups deliberately excluding themselves from participating in pub-\nlic antipoverty programs. These issues are discussed in detail in the following sections.\n\n7 There is a large literature on the pecuniary and nonpecuniary returns to schooling in developing countries\n(Pscharapolous and Woodhall 1985, Schultz 1988).  In addition, several econometric studies have demonstrated\nthe large productivity gains from improved health and nutrition (Strauss 1986, Deolalikar 1988, Sahn and\nAlderman 1989).\n\n11\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nLikewise, there has been growing recognition of the fact that good governance is an impor-\ntant factor that contributes to poverty reduction not only directly but also via its effect on economic\ngrowth, direct poverty alleviation policies, basic social service provision, and democratic space for\npublic participation. Good governance includes transparency and accountability in public decision\nmaking, greater participation of citizens and civil society in administrative decision making, and\ndevolution of administrative and fiscal powers to local governments and communities. One major\nintervention to bring about good governance is the continuing attempt to introduce wide-ranging\nreforms in the public sector.\n\nIII.  The Role of Political Institutions and Political Economy\n\nA primary prerequisite for poverty reduction is political will and commitment. If govern-\nments do not have the political will or commitment to reduce poverty, poverty reduction will either\nnot occur or will occur very slowly. All the factors that cause poverty to decline, such as pro-poor\ngrowth, social development, and good governance, are dependent on political will and commit-\nment. But how can political will for poverty alleviation be engendered?\n\nA.\n\nDemocracy, Political Will, and Poverty Reduction\n\nThere is an emerging literature that argues about the importance of democracy to poverty\nalleviation. The argument is that basic civil liberties, such as freedom of expression and dissen-\nsion, hold governments accountable for their actions, thereby improving performance. The most\nfamous proponents of this hypothesis are Sen (1982) and Dr\u00e8ze and Sen (1989), who have argued\nthat no country with a free press has ever experienced a major famine. They hypothesize that the\nfear of the media focusing on the government\u2019s failure forces governments into prompt famine-\navoidance action. However, as Sen (1982, 214) himself has noted, a free press does not necessarily\neliminate persistent hunger since \u201cthe quiet persistence of regular hunger and non-extreme depri-\nvation are not [newsworthy].\u201d   The case of India is pertinent in this regard; while India has been\nable to avoid large-scale starvation and famine because of its free press, it has been much less\nsuccessful than other countries, such as the PRC and Sri Lanka, in eliminating malnutrition.\n\nLikewise, a cross-country study of 1,488 World Bank-financed government projects in de-\nveloping  countries  over  the  period  1974-1987  finds  that  the  performance  of  these  projects  was\nbetter in countries having greater civil liberties (Isham et al. 1997).8   The effect of civil liberties on\n\n8 A very large number of indicators of civil liberties were used, including (but not limited to) media free of\ncensorship, open public discussion, freedom of assembly and demonstration, freedom of political organization,\nand nondiscriminatory rule of law in politically relevant cases.\n\n12\n\n\fSection III\nThe Role of Political Institutions and Political Economy\n\nproject performance continued to be strong and positive even after controlling for other political\nand economic variables.9\n\nHowever,  it  is  simplistic  to  think  that  democracy  or  civil  liberties  alone  can  guarantee\npoverty reduction. After all, only until recently was it widely believed that a strong and autocratic\nleadership was an essential factor common to all the ADCs that had experienced rapid economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction, such as Korea and Taipei,China in the 1960s and 1970s; Thailand\nin the 1970s and 1980s; and Indonesia in the 1980s and early 1990s. Some scholars have credited\nthe success of Korea and Taipei,China in implementing far-reaching land reform to their \u201denlight-\nened dictatorships\u201d (e.g., Haggard 1996). At the same time, poverty reduction in one of Asia\u2019s most\ndemocratic countries, India, had proceeded at one of the slowest rates in the region, at least until\nthe 1990s.10\n\nIn a review of antipoverty programs in India, Kohli (1987) argued that there are differ-\nences in regime types even within a democratic setting, and that these differences matter signifi-\ncantly to poverty reduction. Three important elements of a pro-poor political regime in a demo-\ncratic setting are: (i) coherent and stable leadership, (ii) clear pro-lower class ideology, and  (iii)\nstrong grassroots-level organization.\n\nNaturally, the next question is why regimes differ in the extent to which they possess these\nthree attributes. In other words, what determines the \u201cpro-poor\u201d bias of the political regime at the\nnational and subnational levels?\n\nB.\n\nInterest Groups and Dominant Coalitions\n\nA modern theory of the state is that governments are rarely monolithic and impervious to\nsocial and political pressure from interest groups.11   Indeed, politicians, bureaucrats, businesses,\nand consumers frequently use the authority of government to distort economic transactions for\ntheir own benefit. Citizens use political influence to obtain access to benefits allocated by the state;\npoliticians use public resources to retain power; businesses seek special favors (such as protection\n\n9 Rather surprisingly, the authors also found a positive association between civil unrest in a country (e.g., protest\ndemonstrations and strikes) and project performance.  This, according to the authors, \u201c\u2026 suggests that some\ndegree of civil tension reflects a citizen\u2019s ability to agitate and influence government\u2019s behavior without negative\nrepercussions\u2014a  mechanism  that  plausibly  leads  to  greater  accountability  and  hence  better  choice  and\nimplementation of projects\u2026 [Thus] basic civil liberties\u2014such as the freedom of individual expression, a pluralistic\nand free media, the ability of groups to organize, and freedom of dissent and criticism\u2014facilitate citizen voice\nand hence more effective government action\u201d (Isham et al. 1997, 235-6).\n\n10 There is some evidence to suggest that, during the 1990s, absolute poverty has declined significantly in India,\n\ncoinciding with the period of economic liberalization and reform.\n\n11 Indeed, what distinguishes \u201cstrong states\u201d from \u201cweak states\u201d is the extent to which social control is vested\nin a large number of local-level social organizations that continually try to extract contracts, jobs, goods, services,\nand authority through the bureaucratic networks of the state.  Such states end up being \u201cweak states\u201d that\nare unable to govern effectively because their leaders are too busy brokering conflicting demands from various\nconstituencies, often for their own survival, to pursue broad social and political agendas (Migdal 1988).\n\n13\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nfrom competition) from the government; and bureaucrats offer access to government benefits for\npersonal reward. The result then is an inefficient and often inequitable allocation of resources.\n\nLobbying by special-interest groups is thus critical to understanding government actions.\nWithin this framework according to de Janvry et al. (1992), the political feasibility of antipoverty\ninterventions depends greatly on the distribution of benefits from the antipoverty intervention,\nwhich in turn depends on the prevailing configuration of pressure groups in the country (e.g., labor\nunions, landlords, peasant movements, consumer groups, women\u2019s groups). Thus, poverty (or, more\ngenerally, development) outcomes will be a function of dominant coalitions prevailing in the coun-\ntry (Bardhan 1984).\n\nThe prospects for poverty alleviation in a country are better the stronger the coalitions are\nof the poor. In turn the relative strength of coalitions of the poor depends on several factors, such\nas whether they are aware of potential gains from collective action, whether they cooperate with\nother groups, and whether they are politicized. There are many mechanisms through which coali-\ntions of the poor can influence the state: via periodic consultations, lobbying through mass media,\nstreet protests, and other forms of activism and conflict.\n\nTo these traditional interest groups must be added another one that has become important\nof late, international institutions.  Developing countries act within the context of the global eco-\nnomic system largely dominated by international institutions such as the International Monetary\nFund, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and World Trade Organization.  These institutions\noften have an important say in influencing a developing country\u2019s choice of poverty-related poli-\ncies.  For example, labor market flexibility may be required of a country like Korea as a precondi-\ntion for joining the OECD.  A country like Cambodia or Viet Nam may be required by multilateral\ninstitutions to have a clear and donor-approved poverty reduction strategy in place to continue\nreceiving preferential-rate loans (such as the Asian Development Fund or International Develop-\nment Association credits).  Thus, external actors can be regarded as another pressure or interest\ngroup influencing government action.\n\n1.\n\nLand Reform\n\nNowhere is the importance of dominant coalitions and interest groups in bringing about\npoverty reduction more evident than in the case of land reform. It is widely recognized that effec-\ntive land reform is a sine qua non of agricultural and economic development.12   Even more impor-\n\n12 The manner in which land is owned and organized affects (i) the incentive framework within which the farmer\nmakes his production and investment decisions, (ii) the sharing of cropping risk between the tenant and the\nlandlord, and (iii) the need for supervision in farming.  There is a great deal of evidence from around the world\nthat owner-cultivators have greater incentives than tenants to increase their work effort, to make longer-term\nproductivity-enhancing  investments  in  their  land,  and  to  adopt  new  and  more  appropriate  agricultural\n\n14\n\n\fSection III\nThe Role of Political Institutions and Political Economy\n\ntantly, land reform is critical to poverty reduction, as landlessness is a root cause of poverty in\nrural Asia (ILO 1977, Khan and Lee 1984, Breman and Mundle 1991). Countries that have under-\ntaken effective land reform not only have had more robust agricultural growth and productivity,13\nthey also have enjoyed a better distribution of income and lower rates of poverty. In addition, an\noften underemphasized by-product of land reform is that \u201c\u2026 by changing the local political struc-\nture in the village, [it] gives more voice to the poor and induces them to become involved in local\nself-governing institutions and the management of local public goods\u201d (Bardhan 1997, 60).\n\nThere is ample evidence that land reform was critical in bringing about agricultural devel-\nopment, poverty reduction, and even industrial growth in Korea and Taipei,China. The sweeping\nland reforms enacted by Korea in 1948-1950 and by Taipei,China in 1949-1953 redistributed be-\ntween one quarter and one half of all available land (Haggard 1990, Ho 1978). Korea, which had\none of the most unequal distributions of land in the world in 1945 (with 3 percent of the rural\npopulation  owning  60  percent  of  the  land  and  a  vast  80  percent  of  the  rural  population  being\nlandless tenants or semitenants), transformed itself into a country with one of the world\u2019s most\nfavorable land distributions. In 1970, Korea\u2019s Gini coefficient of land inequality was merely 0.37\u2014\na great deal lower than Brazil (0.83) or Mexico (0.77) (Shin 1998). This reversal was entirely the\nresult of sweeping land reforms, first by the American military government in 1948 and followed\nby the Korean government in 1950.\n\nIt  is  often  believed  that  the  occupying  American  occupation  forces  were  responsible  for\nimplementing land reform in Korea. However, the real impetus for land reform came from social\nconflict in the form of agrarian struggles that began under Japanese colonial rule in the 1920s\n(Shin 1998). There were widespread tenancy disputes in the 1920s, which resulted in the colonial\n(Japanese) government abandoning its earlier landlord-based policy and its reluctance to inter-\nvene  in  land  disputes.  The  Tenant  Arbitration  Ordinance  was  enacted  in  1932,  which  enabled\nlandlords or tenants to submit claims to nonbinding arbitration by local representatives of county\ntenancy offices. This was followed in 1934 with more land laws that further constrained landlord\n\ntechnologies, because they know that the resulting economic gains are largely theirs. Also, when farm workers\nown their land, there is less need for supervision of labor.  Thus, the shift of a large number of tenants to owner-\ncultivators can have a significant positive impact on agricultural productivity, and rising productivity is necessary\nbefore resources, such as capital and labor, can be transferred successfully out of agriculture to the rest of\nthe economy.\n\n13 However, it has been argued that while there may exist a marked inequality in terms of land ownership in\nmany agrarian economies in Asia, there is much less inequality in terms of operational holdings (Otsuka 1993).\nThe inequality in the distribution of land is further reduced when adjustments are made for soil quality differences\nacross farm sizes, since, in most ADCs, small farms typically are located on superior quality soil than large\nfarms.  These facts tend to weaken the equity argument in favor of land reform.  Moreover, in many poor countries\n(such as Bangladesh), the large size of the population and the small amount of land makes further redistribution\neconomically infeasible.  In these countries, the main plank of antipoverty policies in rural areas would have\nto be based on enhancing land productivity through new seed-fertilizer and irrigation innovations, and not\nthrough further redistribution (Pernia and Quibria 1999).\n\n15\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nrights.14  The power of the landlords was additionally circumscribed with the end of Japanese rule,\nas many of them were branded as collaborators with the colonial forces. It was against this back-\ndrop that many grassroots organizations that dominated local politics in 1945, such as peasant\nunions and people\u2019s committees, proposed sweeping land reform to redress inequity and unfair-\nness in rural society. Far from supporting land reform, the US occupation forces suppressed many\nof these organizations as communist and restored the Japanese colonial framework. This bred\nfrustration and discontent among peasantswhich led to a major agrarian rebellion in the country\nin 1946. While the US military government made some concessions and distributed some Japa-\nnese-owned lands to peasants in 1948, real land reform did not take place until 1950, when the\nNational Assembly passed a sweeping land reform bill (Shin 1998).15\n\nThus, a coalition of tenants and a reform-minded government, provoked by social conflict\nand agrarian unrest, was instrumental in forcing the Korean state to undertake land reforms. It is\ndoubtful  whether  land  reform  would  have  occurred  in  Korea  without  the  tenant  activism  that\nspanned the colonial, liberation, and war periods (Shin 1998).\n\nLand reform in Taipei,China took place under a different set of circumstances. It was car-\nried out in three stages between 1949 and 1953: the compulsory reduction of land rent; the sale of\npublic land to actual tillers; and the \u201cLand-to-the-Tiller Program,\u201d which imposed a limit on the\namount of land that could be held by landlords.16  Land reform was initiated just about the time\nthat the Chinese Communists were about to completely take over the Chinese mainland and pose\na looming threat to the island\u2019s internal security. It was against this background that the Nation-\nalist Party began implementing land reform in Taipei,China, both as a means of gaining political\n\n14 The 1934 Agricultural Lands Ordinance guaranteed contract lengths of at least three years, allowed tenants\nto propose reduction or remission of rent upon crop failure, made contracts renewable unless violated by tenants,\nand forbade agreements in which the tenant waived certain rights (Cho 1979).\n\n15 Interestingly, under the Korean land reform, landlords whose plots were expropriated were compensated for\ntheir land loss with land bonds or financial assets that could be reinvested elsewhere.  The government encouraged\nthe use of these land bonds for industrial capital formation through the purchase of vested nonagricultural\nenterprises.  The land bonds constituted an important vehicle of the capital formation that was needed for\nKorean industrialization, and many landlords, especially the largest ones, profitably used land bonds to become\nindustrial capitalists (Shin 1998).\n\n16 The rent reduction program, initiated in 1949, limited farm rents to a maximum of 37.5 percent of the annual\nyield of the main crops.  Rent reduction was followed by the sale of public land (mostly land owned previously\nby Japanese colonists and confiscated after the war) to tenants, with the price set at 2.5 times the annual yield,\nwhich was well below the market price. Under the land-to-the-tiller program initiated in 1953 and the final\nstep in the land reform process, land owned by landlords in excess of approximately three hectares of medium-\nquality paddy field, or its equivalent, was compulsorily purchased by the government and resold to the tenants\nat 2.5 times the land\u2019s annual yield. The government paid for the land in commodity bonds (70 percent) and\nin shares of stock in four government enterprises (30 percent).  In turn, the tenants paid for the land-in rice\nfor paddy land and in sweet potatoes (converted to cash) for dry land in 20 installments over a period of 10\nyears (Ho 1987).\n\n16\n\n\fSection III\nThe Role of Political Institutions and Political Economy\n\nlegitimacy and preventing Communist penetration into the rural areas (Tai 1973).17   In addition, it\nhelped that the Nationalist Party leaders, coming from the mainland, did not include any repre-\nsentatives of the local landed gentry. Taipei,China was thus conveniently sheltered from the pro-\ntests of indigenous landlords against land redistribution. Likewise, the bureaucracy that had ac-\ncompanied Chiang Kai-shek from the mainland had no indigenous connections and was thus more\nunrestrained in implementing land reform legislation. Thus, a coalition of a nonindigenous ruling\nparty interested in seeking political legitimacy, and a bureaucracy with no connections to indig-\nenous landlords,which were united by a common interest to avert Communist rebellion, were in-\nstrumental in bringing about comprehensive land reforms in Taipei,China.18\n\nUnfortunately,  Korea  and  Taipei,China  are  atypical  among  Asian  developing  countries\n(ADCs) in terms of the success of their land reform programs. Many ADCs have had a difficult time\nenacting and implementing meaningful land reform. In Pakistan, rates of landlessness have actu-\nally increased over time (Irfan and Amjad 1984), and this has been a significant factor in the rising\nrates of rural poverty. An important reason for the lack of progress on land reform in Pakistan has\nbeen the continued dominance of landlords in ruling party coalitions.19   Since Independence, the\nactivists in the Muslim League developed political clout on the basis of their wealth, mainly land\nownership. Landlord families extended and perpetuated their power by entering politics and get-\nting themselves elected to influential positions in village, provincial, and national governments.\nBut even if they do not hold elective office, landlords are still able to exert considerable influence in\ngovernment decision-making (Irfan and Amjad 1984, Stern 2001). Thus, with political clout cap-\ntured, the landlord lobby has been able to thwart efforts to pass and implement meaningful land\nreform. The resulting feudalism in Pakistan has been blamed for the lack of progress on several\nfronts, including agricultural development, industrialization, and eradication of illiteracy.\n\nAnother ADC with an uneven history of success in implementing land reform is the Philip-\npines.  Initial  attempts  at  land  reform  were  motivated  by  a  rebellion  by  Communist  guerrillas\n(known as the Huks) during the 1940s. Under the leadership of President Ramon Magsaysay, a\nnumber  of  reform  laws  were  enacted  during  the  1950s  to  avert  forceful  change  of  the  existing\npolitical order. Since these reforms were not implemented effectively, there was a need for another\nset of reforms, as embodied in the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963 (Tai 1972). Indeed, the\nPhilippines has a long history of land reform legislation that has only been implemented half-\n\n17 In India, too, land reform was used as a means of gaining legitimacy for a new regime.  The Congress Party\ntook up the goal of abolishing the zamindari (sharecropping tenancy) system in 1935 as a way of widening\nits base beyond a small group of intellectuals, becoming a mass independence movement (Tai 1973).\n\n18 On the other hand, land reform in Thailand only marginally affected the farmers, yet agriculture has performed\n\nwell (Rashid and Quibria 1995).\n\n19 Naseem (1977) notes that only 5 percent of farming families were favorably affected by the two major land\nreforms implemented in Pakistan in 1959 and 1972.  Neither of the two land reforms measures directly improved\nthe lot of the landless laborers.\n\n17\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nheartedly. President Marcos launched the Operation Land Transfer program in 1972,20  which was\nfollowed in 1988 by yet another land reform, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law under the\nleadership of President Aquino. Weak implementation found as many as 72 percent of rural fami-\nlies still landless at the end of her term (Putzel 1992). Not surprisingly, agricultural growth has\nbeen poor in the Philippines relative to other countries in Asia. Rice yields in 1991 were less than\nhalf those obtained in PRC, Japan, and Korea.\n\nWith a former NGO leader designated in 1992 as Secretary of the Department of Agrarian\nReform, substantial progress was achieved during the Ramos administration through the transfer\nof public land to cultivators and private land voluntarily sold by their owners to the tenants. Newly\ncreated Agrarian Reform Communities, composed of the new owner-beneficiaries, received tar-\ngeted support services for increased production. Nonetheless, the political will needed to sustain\nthis  momentum  declined  from  1998  onwards,  owing  to  insufficient  funds  allocated  to  the  land\nacquisition  process  coupled  with  mounting  resistance  from  the  large  private  landed  elites  and\nplantation owners. The targeted number of hectares for land transfer has been reduced, while\nprospects for an accelerated program appear unlikely to come from the landlord-dominated legis-\nlature.\n\nCountries that have delayed implementation of land reform find themselves in a quandary,\nsince land reform becomes increasingly more difficult to implement the longer it has been delayed.\nExtensive delays in implementation of land reform not only lead to uncertainty among farmers,\nbut also undermine land markets by allowing landowners to convert their lands to other uses to\ncircumvent the law.\n\nC.\n\nMobilizing Action for Poverty Reduction\n\nGiven the nature of the modern state, how can action for poverty eradication be mobilized\nwithin the often chaotic, free-for-all power grab by various special-interest groups?  Surprisingly,\nvery little thought has been given in the development economics literature (although it abounds in\nNGO literature) to issues of how to build constituencies for poverty eradication; how to form coali-\ntions and alliances that can bring about meaningful land reform; and how to rally and organize\nsupport for rational social policies that benefit everyone in the long run.\n\n1.\n\nCoalitions of the Poor\n\nObviously, poverty reduction is not something that governments, NGOs, or development\ninstitutions can do by themselves for the poor. Ultimately, it is the poor who can extricate them-\n\n20 As Putzel (1992, 374) puts it, \u201c\u2026since the colonial period, landowning interests have shackled the [Filipino]\nbureaucracy and blocked every attempt at comprehensive land registration\u2026. The Marcos years proved that\nan authoritarian form of government has no special proclivity toward reform implementation.\u201d\n\n18\n\n\fSection III\nThe Role of Political Institutions and Political Economy\n\nselves out of poverty. But to be effective, the poor need to build coalitions with other groups, such\nas governments and NGOs. As the IFAD report on rural poverty puts it:\n\n\u2026 it is misguided bureaucratic centralism to plan for the poor; partnerships for\npoverty reduction, wherever possible, start with the agency of the poor themselves,\nwith their preferences and potentials. But it is na\u00efve to suppose that the poor can\nmake bricks without straw; technologies, information, schools and skills have to\nbe built in conjunction with outsiders\u2026. This requires putting the poor at the center\nof the [development] process, as full partners in determining the priorities and the\ndirections of change, emancipating them from the constraints that trap them in\npoverty, empowering them (IFAD 2001, 214).\n\nFor example, in countries such as Korea, it took coalitions of tenants and grassroots orga-\nnizations, such as peasant unions and people\u2019s committees, to pressure the government to enact\nand implement land reform. More recently, coalitions of the rural poor and civil society organiza-\ntions have managed to move poverty to the top of the government\u2019s agenda in Thailand. During\nthe period of rapid growth of the Thai economy during the 1980s and up until the mid-1990s, the\nincidence of poverty in Thailand fell dramatically, and the government had little interest or need\nin focusing much attention on poverty reduction programs. There were a number of poverty alle-\nviation programs on paper, but they amounted to very little.21   However, with the onset of the\nAsian  financial  crisis  in  1997,  the  decade-long  decline  in  poverty  quickly  came  to  an  end,  and\npoverty  rates  increased  sharply.22   As the situation of the poor continued to deteriorate, rural\nunrest began rising in Thailand. In 2000, thousands of villagers took to the streets of Bangkok to\nclamor for action against rural poverty. In addition, there were widespread protests in Bangkok by\nthe rural poor against the impact on their livelihoods of the Pak Moon dam, a hydroelectric facility\nrun by the state utility in northeastern Ubon Ratchathani province. The street protests and other\ndemonstrations received organizational and other support from NGOs, such as the Forum of the\nPoor, a grassroots movement for change in Thailand.23\n\n21 For instance, a World Bank poverty assessment noted: \u201c... The principal conclusion of this evaluation of targeted\nanti-poverty programs in Thailand is that, despite impressions to the contrary, the level of government spending\non these programs is small, and what money is being spent appears to be having little impact on the lives of\nthe poor.  Therefore, effectiveness of these programs in reducing the incidence and severity of poverty is limited.\nThe widespread perception within Thailand that a lot of public spending is devoted to poverty alleviation efforts\nis not borne out by the reality.  Rather, this impression probably reflects the number and variety of publicly-\nfunded programs that are aimed directly or, in most cases, tangentially at helping the poor\u201d (World Bank 1996,\n49-50).\n\n22 The headcount ratio of poverty in Thailand increased from 11.4 percent in 1996 to 13 percent in 1998 and\n15.9 percent in 1999.  This meant that an additional one million persons became poor in 1998, with 1999 seeing\nanother 2 million persons added to this number (World Bank 2001).\n\n23 Forum of the Poor is also referred to sometimes as Assembly of the Poor.  In addition to compensation for\nloss of land and means of livelihood due to dam construction, another issue put on the front-burner by the\ncoalition of NGOs and the poor is the eviction of farmers from forest areas.\n\n19\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nThe coalition of the poor and other civil society support has brought about concrete gains\nfor the poor at the negotiation table. In 1997, the National Assembly passed a new constitution\nthat, for the first time in Thai history, guarantees community rights to self-determination. There\nis also growing consensus in the country on the need for an alternative development model and the\nimportance of developing sustainable communities in which people, especially the poor, have the\npower to manage their own resources in an equitable manner. The Thai Rak Thai party, which ran\non a strong rural poverty alleviation platform, won the national elections in early 2001. Already\nthe new government has gone about implementing major antipoverty projects, such as a Village-\nbased Fund for poor villages and debt relief for farmers.  Poverty alleviation has quite abruptly\nbecome the overriding objective of the new government.\n\nThere are numerous examples of successful coalitions of the poor and civil society organiza-\ntions throughout Asia. One such example is the Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA) in\nthe Indian state of Gujarat. SEWA grew out of the long history of organizing textile workers in the\ncity of Ahmedabad, but adapted those lessons to organizing self-employed women in the informal\nsector. Starting from an urban base in Gujarat, it has now expanded to organizing in the rural\nareas. SEWA is both a trade union and a grassroots movement for the empowerment of the poorest\nwomen in Indian society. Case studies in Carr et al. (1996) indicate that, despite initial skepticism\namong the members, the organization has not only led to more \u2013than moderate income gains for\nthe members on a regular basis, but the experience of managing producer groups has also im-\nparted to the women members greater self-confidence, security, and independence both within\nand outside the household. There is a sense of solidarity among them. Caste divisions have weak-\nened. Women now advise their husbands on cropping decisions. Their advice is also sought on\ncommunity matters (e.g., sanitation). Greater political awareness has led to more active participa-\ntion in local elections (Carr et al. 1996).\n\nIn the Philippines, the Congress for People\u2019s Agrarian Reform (CPAR), a coalition of 22\nNGOs working with 14 large peasant alliances that represent 1.5 million small farmers, peasant\nwomen, landless cultivators, agricultural workers and fisherfolk, lobbied in the late 1980s for the\nincorporation of the People\u2019s Declaration of Principles on Agrarian Reform into a new agrarian\nreform law. With thousands of farmers and civil society members throughout the country march-\ning, protesting, lobbying inside the legislature, and camped day after day at a tent city outside it,\nCongress and the Senate ultimately passed the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) in\n1991. Although weaker than its proponents had envisioned, CARL was more progressive than any\nprevious agrarian reform law passed. Moreover, had not the massive peasant lobbying effort been\nmounted, the Law would have been even more emasculated.\n\nCPAR had a profound impact on society. It gave national and local peasant leaders the\nexperience of attempting to unify the organized peasantry, and some idea of the issues that di-\nvided them. They learned how to build consensus and democratic management, and got to know\nbetter the leaders of other ideological persuasions. These personal friendships undoubtedly kept\nthe largest coalition in Philippine history going much longer than anyone would have predicted.\n\n20\n\n\fSection III\nThe Role of Political Institutions and Political Economy\n\nFisherfolk  issues  surfaced  separately  from  those  of  farmers;  peasant  participation  in  Congres-\nsional debates was institutionalized; and government\u2019s interest in managing dissent rather than\nresponding to peasant demands emerged clearly. Peasants and their NGO supporters learned how\norganizationally strong they had to be to counter the power of entrenched elites (Go\u00f1o 1996).\n\nAlthough other ADCs may not currently have the strong NGOs and peasant organizations\nthat are present in, say, the Philippines or India, it may only be a matter of time before they also\nemerge. At the same time, it should be realized that forming coalitions of the poor may not always\nbe easy, given that they are not homogeneous and have different ideologies. It is possible that\nvarious coalitions of the poor with different ideologies and agenda could actually work at cross\npurposes, undermining each other\u2019s positive efforts.\n\n2.\n\nObtaining Support from the Nonpoor\n\nSometimes, antipoverty programs find little support or even outright rejection because the\ndominant coalition of the nonpoor perceives that it would lose from such programs. However, in\nsuch cases, the political support of some nonpoor groups can be enlisted if they also gain from the\npro-poor policies. For instance, when the incomes of the poor increase, they will buy more goods\nand services produced by the nonpoor, and this multiplier effect will mean that the nonpoor will be\nmore likely to provide political support to policies that increase the productivity and incomes of the\npoor  (Streeten  1995).  However,  these  multiplier  effects  from  antipoverty  programs  need  to  be\npublicized to the nonpoor, especially the middle class. In turn, this suggests that the success of\npoverty alleviation programs may well depend upon how the programs are \u201cpackaged\u201d and \u201csold\u201d\nto the nontargeted population.\n\nLikewise, to overcome political opposition to pro-poor policies, especially in times of finan-\ncial crises, (nonpecuniary) compensation may have to be paid to the nonpoor, even though this may\nseem  inequitable  (Streeten  1995,  IFAD  2001).24   Streeten (1995) cites the case of urban wage\nearners who are often the losers in periods of structural adjustment. Although these groups are\ngenerally better-off than farmers, some redeployment payments or retraining schemes to these\nvocal and powerful groups may be necessary, if only to \u201cbuy\u201d their support for pro-poor, progres-\nsive reform. As Streeten (1995, 13) puts it, \u201c\u2026 the objective of benefiting all the poor and only the\npoor is [politically] impossible to achieve; excess coverage is preferable to deficient coverage, both\nfor political and administrative reasons.\u201d  This idea  of not strictly limiting the benefits of antipov-\nerty programs to the poor has been gaining ground in recent years (Gelbach and Pritchett 1995,\nLanjouw and Ravallion 1998, van de Walle 1998).\n\n24 For example, the IFAD report on poverty argues that \u201c\u2026 in some cases, the poor may benefit by uniting with\nsome of the rich in a coalition\u2026.  Many non-poor, for whatever reason, often support forms of insurance or\nuniversal coverage amounting to pro-poor redistribution: for example, to provide basic health care or social\nsafety nets\u201d (IFAD 2001).\n\n21\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nA difficulty, however, with this argument is that leakages of antipoverty program benefits\nto the nonpoor are not self-limiting, and the risk of the nonpoor capturing the dominant share of\npublic resources, and crowding out the poor completely from government benefits, is a real one\n(Bardhan 1984). This is especially likely to be the case when resources for antipoverty programs\nare limited, as in most developing countries. It is not clear at what point a government should\ndraw the line.\n\nD.\n\nTiming of Program Capture\n\nAnother important issue in the political economy of (antipoverty) program capture is that\nof timing. It is often the case that the nonpoor capture the benefits of an antipoverty program in\nthe initial stages of program implementation, even when the program in question is ostensibly\ntargeted only to the poor. This may be due to imperfect targeting, lack of information, or incentive\nincompatibility. However, as the antipoverty program expands over time, the incremental benefits\nderived by the poor from the program increase.\n\nWhat this means is that average participation rates of the poor in antipoverty programs\nwill understate their marginal participation rate. Using household survey data from the Indian\nNational Sample Survey, Lanjouw and Ravallion (1998) test this hypothesis, and find that the\nmarginal benefits to the poorest quintile of households from the three main antipoverty programs\nin India, namely, public works, the Integrated Rural Development Program, and the Public Distri-\nbution System (a food subsidy program), are significantly greater than both the average benefits\nas well the marginal benefits derived by the richest quintile. In addition, they find that although\naverage primary school enrollment rates are lower for children in the poorest quintile than in the\nrichest quintile, the marginal odds of primary school enrollment are significantly greater for the\npoorest quintile. These empirical findings support the early capture theory, i.e., that the nonpoor\nbenefit  from  public  programs  early  in  the  program  cycle,  while  the  benefits  to  the  poor  accrue\nlater.\n\nAn example of the early-capture model is the social security program in Thailand. In late\n1998, as a response to the financial crisis that hit Thailand and other countries in East Asia in\n1997, the Thai government implemented a far-reaching change to the social security system that\nhad been in place in the early 1990s. The change included the establishment of pension and child\nallowance schemes for private-sector employees. The idea behind the change in coverage benefits\nwas to offer social protection to the poor affected by the Asian financial crisis.\n\nHowever, as of 1999, only 15 percent of Thai workers reported coverage under the Social\nSecurity  Act  (SSA),  with  wide  variations  across  different  types  of  workers  (World  Bank  2000).\nSince  enrollment  in  the  SSA  is  mandatory  for  employees  of  large  private-sector  firms  and  for\npublic  employees,  social  security  coverage  is  strongly  biased  toward  the  better-off  (high-wage)\nworkers. This is seen in Figure 3, which shows 82 percent of private-sector wage employees earn-\ning more than Baht 15,000 per month, but only 14 percent of those earning Baht 3,001-4,000 per\n\n22\n\n\fSection III\nThe Role of Political Institutions and Political Economy\n\nmonth had SSA coverage as of August 1999. Indeed, according to the SSA rules, only workers who\nwere paid more than the minimum wage were eligible for social security coverage, which meant\nthat the lowest-paid workers were automatically excluded from program participation.\n\nThis bias toward high-wage employees is not a failure of the Thai social security program\nper se. The program is relatively new in Thailand. The history of social security programs in more\ndeveloped countries suggests that initial coverage rates are typically low and are biased toward\nformal-sector employees who tend to be better-off than informal-sector and own-account employ-\nees.  The  relatively  higher  incomes  and  salaries  of  formal-sector  employees,  in  fact,  makes  the\nsocial security program financially viable and sustainable. Over time, however, population cover-\nage  of  the  program  expands  and  reaches  the  low-income  and  informal-sector  groups,  with  the\nbetter-off  salaried  employees  often  cross-subsidizing  the  lower-paid  informal-sector  and  own-\naccount employees.\n\nThe Thai government has definite plans to expand the social security program rapidly over\nthe next few years to cover employees of companies with 10 or fewer employees. Workers set to\nbenefit from the program\u2019s expansion include those working in garages, restaurants, beauty par-\nlors, and all independent ventures. By some accounts, domestic helpers will also be covered by the\nsocial security program. Thus, the poor, who did not benefit from the program in its early stages,\nwill eventually obtain social protection from this program.\n\nFigure 3.

The Role of Social and Cultural Institutions\n\nA.\n\nExclusion and Poverty\n\nExclusion can be defined as an involuntary inability to participate in social and commercial\ninteractions, in the institutions of society, and in the market because of factors beyond an individual\u2019s\nor group\u2019s control (Barry 1998, Narayan 2000b, Sindzingre 1999). Individuals or entire groups can\nbe excluded from labor, land, and capital markets; from sharing in mainstream cultural, social,\nand community processes and activities; from social services such as schooling, medical services,\nand safe drinking water; from politics, participatory processes, and voicing their demands; and\nfrom participation in public programs and policy interventions.\n\nExclusion and income-poverty are not identical concepts. It is entirely possible for an indi-\nvidual or group to be excluded and yet not be poor (in the sense of having an income that affords\nthem a minimum standard of living), as in the case of some indigenous peoples and materially\nwell-off widows. Likewise, an individual or group can be poor without being excluded. Indeed, in\nmost developing countries, the vast majority of the poor are fully integrated in social and commu-\nnity networks of mutual assistance. Their poverty may be related to their lack of physical assets\nand their low productivity, not due to their exclusion. However, even in cases where exclusion does\nnot lead to greater income-poverty, it is always linked to exclusion from institutions of society. It\ntherefore has a profound negative impact on the quality of life of the excluded and leads to a poorer\nsense of well-being (Narayan 2000b).\n\nIn general, however, there is a close correlation between exclusion and poverty. Exclusion\ngreatly increases the risk of poverty, as excluded individuals and groups are less likely to find\nways to benefit from economic growth and from formal safety net programs. At the same time,\nsevere poverty and deprivation can lead individuals or groups to exclude themselves from society\nout of a sense of shame and humiliation. In this sense, poverty and exclusion form a vicious circle,\nwith exclusion increasing the risk of poverty and impoverishment, in turn reinforcing exclusion.\nFor this reason, exclusion is often identified as a facet of poverty and poverty as a facet of exclu-\nsion. Indeed, within a distributive justice-based definition of poverty, the absence of dignity and\nparticipation in social life are included as poverty indicators (Rawls 1971, Sen 1992).\n\nThere are various dimensions of exclusion. Among the most observed is economic exclu-\nsion, which means exclusion from access to factors of production (such as land, labor, capital, and\ninfrastructure), thus resulting in low productivity, low incomes, and poverty. Additionally, certain\nindividuals and groups might be excluded from information, which is also an important factor of\nproduction and income generation.\n\nAnother dimension of exclusion is political exclusion, which can be the result of peculiar\ncircumstances or of government policies. Individuals and groups may be excluded because they are\ntoo few in number to attract government attention, too weak to lobby effectively for their rights\nand interests, or too unimportant as voters or taxpayers in the eyes of government. In some cases,\n\n24\n\n\fSection IV\nThe Role of Social and Cultural Institutions\n\nespecially when governments have been brought to power not by election but by a particular inter-\nest or ethnic group, the government would have a strong interest in continuing the political exclu-\nsion of other ethnic or interest groups in the country. Even in many democratic regimes, especially\nin countries marked by high levels of illiteracy, the political machinery of patronage effectively\nshuts out some groups from any governmental decision making.\n\nA third and final dimension of exclusion is social exclusion. According to Sindzingre (1999),\nsocial exclusion has two features. The first is that of social capital, in which an individual is de-\nprived of relations, networks, and social support. In this case, poverty is the result of a lack of\nconnection to social assistance networks for reasons of demography, poor health, or migration.\n\nThe second feature of social exclusion is discrimination based on systems of norms and\nrules. The discrimination can be permanent and due to circumstances of birth, such as discrimina-\ntion against women, low castes, and ethnic or religious minorities, or it can be acquired and tran-\nsitory, such as discrimination against certain occupations, single mothers, the elderly or orphans.\n\nB.\n\nExcluded Groups in Asia\n\nIn the rural areas, the groups that are socially, economically, or politically excluded are\nlargely the landless, small and marginal tenant cultivators, and indigenous peoples (often ethnic\nminorities). In the urban areas, it is often recent rural migrants; women (especially widows and\nthose heading households); and children (especially street children, child workers, and orphans).\nIn addition, there are entire regions of countries that have been traditionally excluded from social\nand  economic  institutions,  either  because  of  their  geographical  isolation  or  because  they  have\nlarge proportions of excluded groups, such as indigenous peoples.\n\n1.\n\nLandless\n\nMany of the ADCs that are the subject of this study have a large class of landless and near-\nlandless households. Sharecropping is also widespread, especially among the South Asian coun-\ntries. It is estimated that 31-35 percent of the agricultural labor force in India is landless. The\nestimates for Bangladesh are even higher (37 percent). In virtually all of the South Asian coun-\ntries, including Pakistan, the proportion of the landless rural population has been steadily increas-\ning over time, in part due to rapid population growth but largely due to unequal distribution of\nland.25\n\nIn countries where the number of landless and land-poor is large, many of the rural poor\nwork as tenants and sharecroppers. In Asia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Philippines, a relatively\n\n25 The Gini index of land inequality was 0.55 in Bangladesh in 1981-1990 and 0.51 in the Philippines and Pakistan\nin 1971-1980.  Thailand and Korea have relatively lower land Gini coefficients at 0.37 (in 1981-1990) and 0.35\n(in 1971-1980), respectively (IFAD 2001).  Taipei,China has the most favorable distribution of land, with a\nland Gini coefficient of 0.32 in 1976 (Jomo 2000).\n\n25\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nhigh incidence of sharecropping. The relationship between landlords and tenants is often highly\nunequal (Okidebe 2001). Since land is the most important collateral for credit and since land and\ncredit markets are often interlocked, these individuals and groups are effectively excluded from\ncredit markets and have fewer opportunities to smooth consumption in the face of an uncertain\nenvironment and fluctuating incomes.\n\n2.\n\nSmall and Marginal Tenant-cultivators\n\nSmall and marginal farmers, whether tenants or owner-operators, are often among the\npoorest and most excluded segments of Asian societies. Data from Thailand offer a powerful illus-\ntration of how small and marginal owner-operators have been more or less completely excluded\nfrom the benefits of economic development during the 1990s. Figure 4 shows a higher incidence of\npoverty among small- and medium-size farmers. 26   Note also that the incidence of poverty among\nsmall landholders increased from 1994 to 1996, even as the Thai economy and Thai agriculture\nwere experiencing robust growth and medium and large landholders were experiencing declines in\npoverty. With the onset of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the incidence of poverty among small\nlandholders continued to increase into 1999, surpassing even the incidence of poverty recorded in\n1992.  While  medium-size  farmers  (those  owning  5-19  rais  of  land)  fared  somewhat  better,  the\nincidence of poverty among them did not change much between 1992 and 1999 either.\n\nFigure 4.

If corrections were made for land quality, it is likely\nthat the relationship between size of owned land and poverty would be even stronger than shown in Figure\n23, as a large fraction of land in the Northeast of Thailand is hilly or otherwise of low quality.\n\n26\n\n\fSection IV\nThe Role of Social and Cultural Institutions\n\n3.\n\nUrban Slum Dwellers\n\nUrban slum dwellers now constitute some 30 percent of Asia\u2019s poor. Although urban pov-\nerty ratios were declining until 1997, the Asian crisis stalled this process. As residents of squalid\nurban settlements, informal settlers (\u201csquatters\u201d) depend on the low-productivity informal economy\nfor their livelihood, have malnourished children, live in miserable housing, and have little or no\naccess  to  basic  social  services  like  clean  water,  sanitation,  health  clinics,  and  schools.  Chronic\ninsecurity stems from the constant threat of eviction.\n\n4.\n\nWomen\n\nWomen suffer exclusion by virtue of cultural norms that ascribe differential roles, rights,\nand values to women and men in the household, the economy, and the society at large. Lack of\nadequate health care is reflected in high maternal mortality rates, listed at 551 per 100,000 live\nbirths in South Asia, compared to the world average of 437 per 100,000. Notable exceptions are Sri\nLanka  and  Kerala,  India.  Women  comprise  the  majority  of  illiterates  in  Asia,  most  of  them  in\nBangladesh, Pakistan, and Lao PDR. However, primary enrollment rates in Bangladesh and Lao\nPDR are now at 69 and 70 percent, suggesting the next generation of women will be decidedly\nbetter educated than their mothers.  In contrast, female adult literacy rates in Southeast Asia are\nclose to 95 percent, with primary enrollment rates reaching 100 percent.\n\n5.\n\nChildren\n\nChildren from poor families represent an especially vulnerable group. Like their parents,\nthe poorest among them face daily deprivation of food, health care, education, and shelter; abuse\nin the home; as well as being subjected to child labor in dangerous work settings. Increasing num-\nbers are being led into drug trafficking or sold into prostitution and pornography. Again, larger\nnumbers of South Asian more than East or Southeast Asian children suffer from exclusion.\n\n6.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nIndigenous  peoples,  often  referred  to  as  tribals,  hill  tribes,  scheduled  tribes,  aboriginal\npeople, backward tribes, hill or mountain people, indigenous cultural communities, or ethnic mi-\nnorities, are another commonly excluded group throughout Asia. It is estimated that Asia is home\nto about 200 million out of the total 300 million indigenous peoples in the world (UN Department\nof Public Information 1992). These include the Jumma peoples of Bangladesh; the Tai-Kadai, Mon-\nKhmer, Hmong-Mien, and Tibeto-Burmese in Lao PDR; the Baluchi, Pathan, and Kalash in Paki-\nstan; the Aeta, Igorot, Mangyan, Tagbanwa in the Philippines; the Aborigines of Taipei,China; the\nMons,  Karen,  and  Akha  Hill  Tribe  in  Thailand;  and  the  Kinh,  Tay,  and  Hmong  in  Viet  Nam.\nDespite their diversity, they share common experiences of exclusion and oppression.\n\n27\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nIndigenous peoples typically have least access to social services, having been driven by\ncolonization attempts in the past to remote areas like forests and mountains. In Viet Nam, the\nenrollment rate of indigenous children is far below the national average, and this is especially\npronounced  for  indigenous  girls  who  are  traditionally  kept  at  home  (UNICEF  n.d.).  Moreover,\nindigenous peoples in Viet Nam suffer problems of land use, food production, income diversifica-\ntion, poor health resulting from lack of clean water and unsanitary conditions, and unaffordable\nmedical treatment costs (Viet Nam Development Report 2000, 2001).\n\nOnly half (52 percent) of the aborigines of Taipei,China receive elementary education (US\nDepartment of State 1995). In Lao PDR, there are approximately 4,000 villages in mountainous\nethnic areas without primary schools (ADB 2000b). In the Philippines in 1994, some of the prov-\ninces of the Cordillera Autonomous Region, where the Kalinga and Ifugao dwell, were among the\n10 provinces with the lowest functional literacy levels. Furthermore, the Cordillera Autonomous\nRegion in 1997 had one of the lowest life expectancy rates at 63 years (HDN and UNDP 2000).\n\n6.\n\nRegional Exclusion\n\nRegional exclusion is often due to historical circumstances, geographic isolation, or a large\ndensity of indigenous peoples. An example of such a region is the Northeast Thailand, which has\nhistorically been the poorest region in the country. Figure 5, which shows the incidence of income-\npoverty in the five regions of Thailand over a 12-year period, shows that the Northeast has consis-\ntently been the poorest region in the country: in 1988, through the boom years of the early 1990s,\nand again during the period of the Asian financial crisis (1997-1999). In fact, while poverty de-\n\nFigure 5.

While Viet Nam has relatively low infant mortality\nrelative to other countries at its level of per capita income, there are large variations in infant\nmortality across geographical regions. The Northern Uplands and Central Highlands,  home to the\nlargest concentration of ethnic minorities in the country, have among the highest infant mortality\nrates in the country, reflecting both the low living standards and generally poor access to health\nservices in these regions. Infant mortality rates in these two regions actually increased between\nthe 1989 Census and the 1994 Intercensal Demographic Survey, even though the average infant\nmortality rate for the country did not change (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Infant Mortality Decline by Region, 1989-1993\n\n1989\nPopulation\nCensus\n\n45.4\n37.0\n46.5\n47.5\n56.4\n33.9\n44.1\n45.0\n\nInfant Mortality Rates\n1994 ICDS\n\nPercent\nchange\n\n37.0\n-4.6\n-18.9\n-21.7\n27.0\n-8.0\n9.3\n0.2\n\n62.2\n35.3\n37.7\n37.2\n71.6\n31.2\n48.2\n45.1\n\nNorthern Uplands\nRed River Delta\nNorth Central\nCentral Coast\nCentral Highlands\nSoutheast\nMekong River Delta\nViet Nam\n\nSources: GSO (1990, 1995).\n\nC.\n\nSocial Capital and Poverty Reduction\n\nThe  impact  of  social  exclusion  can  be  mitigated  by  access  to  social  capital\u2014norms  and\nsocial relations embedded in social structures of society that enable people to coordinate action\nand achieve desired goals (Narayan 1999). Social capital is created when people form social con-\nnections  and  networks  based  on  principles  of  mutual  trust,  reciprocity,  and  norms  for  actions\n(Racelis 1999). The relationships and connections can either be egalitarian (or horizontal) or char-\nacterized by unequal power relationships (hierarchical), so long as they facilitate harmonization\nand interpersonal cooperation for mutual benefit. In addition, there are macro-institutions and\nstructures (e.g., government, political regime, legal system, civil and political liberties) that affect\nthe rate and pattern of economic and social development. All these forms of social capital co-exist\nin society to maximize its impact on economic and social outcomes. For example, macro-institu-\ntions, such as the government, can provide an enabling environment for local associations and\nfamilies to develop and flourish. In turn, local associations can help sustain regional and national\ninstitutions.\n\n29\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nThe ability of the poor to survive adverse conditions and be resilient largely depends on\ntheir access to either bonding social capital (i.e., relationships among themselves) and/or bridging\nsocial capital (i.e., links to groups with access to influence and resources). The main sources of\nsocial capital include the family, community, and civil society.\n\nThe first building block in the creation of social capital for the larger society is the family.\nThis is the most reliable source of bonding social capital. Through the cooperation of all household\nmembers, resiliency mechanisms are devised and negotiated to maximize the abilities of the house-\nhold to cope with adversity.\n\nThe community augments the family as a source of social capital. In Asia, social networks\nabound in urban and rural communities, with many examples of neighbors, friends, and members\nof local associations coming to one another\u2019s assistance for overcoming survival, safety, and social\nproblems. For instance, people lend cash or food to friends and relatives, and contribute to their\nwedding  and  funeral  expenses.  Rotating  savings  and  credit  associations,  and  informal  savings\nclubs are commonplace, as are instances of communities working together to upgrade their alleys\nand pathways (Viet Nam-Sweden Mountain Rural Development Program, ActionAid, Save the\nChildren Fund (UK) and Oxfam (GB) 1999). In the Philippines, the sense of volunteerism and\nmutual support is perhaps best embodied in the traditional practice of bayanihan, where commu-\nnity members help a neighbor transfer residence by lifting the hut on bamboo poles, and carrying\nit  all  the  way  to  its  new  location.  In  Pakistan,  a  system  of  community-level  food  security  and\nwelfare can be found in the zakat system, a tax levied on the wealthy for the benefit of the poor and\nneedy.  Redistribution  occurs  through  the  mosque.  Those  eligible  to  receive  zakat,  called  the\n\nFigure 6.

There are currently 1.5 million mustahiqeen in Pakistan who are targeted by the\nzakat system (Social Policy and Development Centre 2000).\n\nIn Korea, a movement of various social, religious, labor, and management groups contrib-\nuted immensely to relief operations for the poor and unemployed most affected by the Asian finan-\ncial crisis. Voluntary donations for the poor rose in terms of both the total amount (by 8 percent)\nand the number of contributors (by 28 percent) (Moon et al. 1999). Likewise, in the aftermath of\nthe Asian financial crisis, there was an increase in the number of village savings groups created\nand in community membership in these groups (World Bank 2000c).\n\nIt is, of course, possible for social capital to be destroyed. For instance, social capital helped\nbuffer the initial impact of the Asian financial currency crisis on the poor in countries such as\nThailand. Individuals who lost their jobs and became unemployed were taken in and supported by\ntheir families and communities. However, as the economic shock spread and persisted over time,\nsocial capital started giving way. Signs of the destruction of social capital included rising rates of\nprostitution, drug use, abandonment of orphans, and suicides (Figure 6) (World Bank 2000c).27\n\nGiven that social capital is such a critical source of resiliency for the poor, it is important\nfor government poverty reduction initiatives not to supplant or undermine these networks but\ninstead to build on them.\n\nD.\n\nCivil Society as an Institutional Mechanism for Poverty Reduction\n\nIn addition to the family and the community, civil society forms an important source of\nsocial capital. Civil society consists of both formal and informal organizations that operate outside\nof  the  state  and  market  to  promote  various  interests  in  society.  These  include,  among  others,\nNGOs, community associations, labor unions, cooperatives, religious groups, professional associa-\ntions, student organizations, media, and academic institutions.\n\nMost of these organizations fall into three major categories: community-based organiza-\ntions (CBOs), civic or professional organizations, and NGOs. CBOs feature a mostly poor grassroots\nmembership operating on a voluntary basis through associations, unions, or cooperatives. Civic/\n\n27 What is perhaps not so obvious is that economic expansion may also destroy some forms of social capital.  When\nemployment opportunities outside a village improve, people with weak ties, for example, young men, are likely\nto take advantage of them and make a break with customary obligations or social norms.  Those with stronger\nattachments may anticipate this and perceive that the benefits from complying with agreements are now lower.\nEither way, the norms of reciprocity could break down, leaving some sections (e.g., the women and the old)\nworse off.  This illustrates a general possibility in which growth of markets elsewhere has adverse effects on\nthe functioning of a local, nonmarket institution (Dasgupta 2000). In a study of 48 water users\u2019 organizations\nin Tamil Nadu (an Indian state), for example, Bardhan (2000 b) reports that expanded market linkage resulted\nin greater violations of water allocation rules.\n\n31\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nprofessional organizations are mostly voluntary and revolve around the interests of the members,\nwho fall into the better-off socioeconomic category. NGOs represent intermediary organizations\nwith salaried professional organizers and development workers who strengthen poor people\u2019s ca-\npacities and participation while promoting needed reforms in the government and business sector.\nTogether, NGOs and CBOs all over Asia are at the forefront of advocacy efforts to bring\njustice, peace, and equity to poor people (Racelis 2000b). They have been instrumental in helping\ncommunities  draw  on  and  expand  their  social  capital.  However,  it  must  be  acknowledged  that\nalthough NGOs have reached significant numbers of poor people in ways that the government has\nnot, there have been shortcomings. In terms of their antipoverty roles, NGOs are now realizing\nthat their approaches have indeed benefited the poor\u2014but not the poorest. This poses a challenge.\nOne of the best examples of a CBO that has improved the lives of millions of the poorest people in\nBangladesh is the Grameen Bank, an innovative banking system drawing upon and adding to the\nsocial capital elements of mutual trust, accountability, participation, and creativity. The Grameen\nBank, which began in 1976, targets and mobilizes the poor, and creates social and financial condi-\ntions for them to receive credit on reasonable terms. Reversing conventional banking practice, it\nlends small amounts without physical collateral to groups of poor borrowers, mostly women. The\nscheme relies on group responsibility, where individual access to credit by a group member de-\npends  on  the  entire  group\u2019s  repayment  behavior.  On  the  problem  of  monitoring  and  enforcing\ncontracts, peer pressure is utilized and helps screen good borrowers from bad ones (World Bank\n1998, Khandker 1994).\n\nAnother example of a CBO that has worked is the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) in Pakistan.\nThe OPP has demonstrated how urban informal settlers can bring dramatic improvements to their\ncommunities when they unite to contribute their own funds and labor to a local project (Hasan\n1996, Racelis 2000a). The OPP has successfully organized the poor informal-sector settlers in one\nof Karachi\u2019s largest slums to build themselves a model low-cost sewerage system. In addition, its\npartnership with urban slum dwellers has produced model programs in basic health and family\nplanning, housing technology, education support services, credit and income generation, and so-\ncial forestry (UN-ESCAP 2001, HSD-AIT 1999).\n\nYet another illustration comes from the Philippines. In 1992, after many years of advocacy\nand pressure from civil society groups, the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA) was\npassed by the legislature. This Act gave the urban poor many new entitlements, including satisfac-\ntory resettlement sites in the event that poor communities had to vacate their informal settle-\nments. Certain prescriptions guaranteeing people\u2019s rights in the eviction process were developed,\nsuch as sufficient notice and identification of the eviction authorities.\n\nThe processes aimed at poverty eradication through people\u2019s empowerment are very differ-\nent from traditional government projects that \u201c\u2026serve the bureaucracy of the aid system rather\nthan the micro- or macro tasks [linked to people\u2019s development]\u2026. They [government projects] are\nmost suitable when development means building physical infrastructure, and least appropriate for\ncomplex change involving human beings (Fowler 1997, 17).\n\n32\n\n\fSection IV\nThe Role of Social and Cultural Institutions\n\nE.\n\nNGOs as Poverty Reduction Intermediaries\n\nIn Asia, civil society movements are generally equated with nongovernmental organiza-\ntions, most of which are composed of middle-class social activists. This stems in part from NGOs\nhaving consistently been in the front line of democratization in developing societies for the last 30\nyears or so. They may be classified in terms of their dominant orientations as: service providers,\ndevelopment, and empowerment.\n\nService-provider NGOs initiate livelihood, credit and health projects, and training and edu-\ncation activities, among others. Empowerment NGOs aim to transform the socioeconomic system\nby addressing the structural causes of poverty thereby enabling people to obtain power through\norganization. Development NGOs endeavor to do both: meet short- and medium-term poverty re-\nduction goals, while confronting the structural causes of poverty.\n\nIn attacking poverty, NGOs have taken on the following roles (San Juan 1996): (i) socioeco-\nnomic empowerment of poor communities through holistic sectoral and community organizing and\ndifferent levels of socioeconomic education and training (e.g., skills training in enterprise develop-\nment and in business management); (ii) delivery of services needed for enterprise and cooperative\ndevelopment (e.g., technology, credit); (iii) development of models and technologies in enterprise\ndevelopment for poor communities; (iv) advocacy against environmentally destructive and waste-\nful business/industry practices; (v) advocacy for pro-people economic strategies and approaches\n(e.g., agrarian reform); and (vi) checking unsustainable and inequitable economic development\nstrategies.\n\nIn Asia, the NGO sector has shown steady growth in numbers. Bangladesh and the Philip-\npines are each listed as having more than 40,000 NGOs. In contrast, there are very few local NGOs\nin Lao PDR and Viet Nam, although their numbers are increasing. At the same time, mass organi-\nzations of farmers, women, and youth in these two countries have, under political party leader-\nship, taken on many of the service, organizational, and advocacy functions of NGOs.\n\nDespite the energy expended by NGOs in supporting people\u2019s development, some kind of\nworkable  relationship  is  needed  with  the  state  if  the  results  are  to  make  a  difference  for  poor\npeople. It is noteworthy, for example, that even in Bangladesh, which holds the Asian record for\nthe number of NGOs relative to the population, all the NGOs taken together do not reach more\nthan 20 percent of the rural poor. Accordingly, government-NGO collaboration in addressing pov-\nerty on a comprehensive, countrywide basis is necessary.\n\nThe heterogeneity of experiences is evident. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam, international NGOs\nplay an important community development role in partnership with the government. They work in\nremote areas that the government often cannot reach. Besides international NGOs, mass organi-\nzations  exist  in  Lao  PDR  and  function  to  some  extent  like  local  NGOs.  These  include  the  Lao\nWomen\u2019s Union (LWU), Lao Youth Organization (LYO), Lao Patriotic Front for Reconstruction\n(LPFR), and Lao Trade Union. The Lao PDR government recognizes them as contributing to na-\ntional development and social mobilization, and hence partly finances their operations. Over the\n\n33\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nyears, these mass organizations have transformed from centrally controlled, public opinion mak-\ning mechanisms into institutions promoting economic and social development.\n\nIn Viet Nam as well, there are several strong mass organizations that are equivalent to\nlocal NGOs in other countries. These organizations were formed in the 1930s to mobilize support\nfor the defense of the country. Called Social NGOs (SNGOs), these include the Viet Nam Women\u2019s\nUnion (VWU), Viet Nam Youth Organization (VYO), Viet Nam Farmers Association (VFA), and\nViet Nam War Veterans Association (VWVA). Many government officials and retired army offi-\ncials hold part-time positions in the local organizations of these SNGOs, in as much as the develop-\nment of these SNGOs occurred under the auspices of the Communist Party and the central govern-\nment.\n\nThese  mass  organizations  thus  cannot  strictly  be  part  of  civil  society,  since  they  share\nmany of the characteristics of state organizations. They are not expected to be critical of govern-\nment or its policies. This said, their broad network of organizations extending from central to local\nlevels, and their large membership (over 11 million VWU members and around four million VYO\nmembers), allow them to play a crucial role in the successful implementation of government poli-\ncies (Riska n.d., United Nations in Viet Nam 1999).\n\nBangladesh and Pakistan have similar histories and approaches taken by government vis-\n\u00e0-vis NGOs. Pakistani NGOs now number between 25,000 and 30,000 (ADB 1999c). They can be\nclassified  according  to  the  focus  of  their  work:  (i)  advocacy  and  lobbying;  (ii)  policy  issues  and\ndebates; (iii) emergency, rehabilitation, and relief organizations; and (iv) implementation of devel-\nopment projects and programs, including service delivery groups and community-based organiza-\ntions. Most NGOs in Pakistan, however, engage in emergency, rehabilitation, and relief work (ADB\n1999d). Only about 100 NGOs are considered to be actively involved in assisting in development\nwork, i.e., capable of implementing community-based projects with the appropriate skills, cover-\nage, linkages, delivery mechanisms, and documentation systems. Others tackle income genera-\ntion, poverty reduction, vocational training, nutrition and food security, and maternal and child\nhealth, and reproductive health (ADB 1999d).\n\nIn Bangladesh, an estimated 20,000 registered NGOs working in 78 percent of the villages\nare said to benefit some 24 million people (ADB 1999g). Bangladesh is one of the leaders of the\ndeveloping  world  in  the  number,  scope  of  work,  and  impact  of  its  NGOs  in  poverty  alleviation\n(Sobhan  1998).  Their  efforts  have  focused  on  microcredit;  employment  and  income  generation;\nformal and nonformal education of children and adults; health, nutrition, and family planning;\nestablishment of effective democratic processes at the grassroots level; women\u2019s rights; environ-\nment; poultry and livestock; water supply and sanitation; and human rights and legal aid. Fur-\nther, Bangladeshi NGOs are becoming increasingly active in public policy advocacy roles, on issues\nsuch as drug policy, breast feeding, reproductive rights, land reform, indigenous people\u2019s rights,\nprimary education, and flood action (ADB 1999c). Their campaigns have had substantial effects on\npublic policy (ADB 1999e). Some of the developing world\u2019s most successful NGOs, such as BRAC,\nGrameen Bank, and PROSHIKA are based in Bangladesh.\n\n34\n\n\fSection IV\nThe Role of Social and Cultural Institutions\n\nIn Thailand, NGOs have taken on strong advocacy and community support roles toward\npro-people and pro-poor strategies and approaches. They openly criticize government and private-\nsector entities that undermine or resist these approaches and have no hesitation to take to the\nstreet in protest together with their grassroots partners. For example, one of the most important\nroles assumed by Thai NGOs has been to challenge Bangkok-centric anti-environmental develop-\nment trends. The government allowed advocacy groups to operate in 1992, and today, these groups\nhave proven instrumental in protecting natural resources and the environment, especially by ex-\nposing harmful industrial practices. The construction of the Nam Choam Dam, for example, was\nchallenged by a well-organized NGO alliance in cooperation with the media. They succeeded in\nthwarting the government\u2019s plans to build this major dam in Thailand\u2019s most valuable western\nborder forests. In the South, the Yad Fon Foundation works effectively with provincial govern-\nments and local villagers to protect coastal mangroves and fishing against the destructive practice\nof prawn farm cultivation and trawl fishing. The government has generally supported NGO contri-\nbutions to national development, especially in social service delivery and resource management,\nbut more cautiously in advocacy roles.\n\nNGOs in the Philippines have likewise assumed strong advocacy roles over the years. This\nis due to their origins in 20th century social movements of various peasant, worker, and urban\npoor groups protesting their continuing marginalization and disaffection with incompetent, cor-\nrupt, and authoritarian government administrations (Silliman and Noble 1998). NGOs in the Phil-\nippines operate in wide-ranging development areas\u2014from agrarian reform to food security, health,\nemployment, biotechnology, micro-credit, housing, livelihood, information technology for people\u2019s\norganizations (POs), and other issues. They have challenged the development paradigms of the\nvarious governments as insufficiently geared to equity and poverty elimination. When former Presi-\ndent  Estrada  appeared  to  be  devoting  more  attention  to  the  pursuit  of  personal  gain  through\nfraudulent means rather than ensuring effective pro-poor governance, his initial NGO and PO\nsupporters were among the first to bring him to account.\n\nAn interesting development since 1996 has been the increasing incorporation of NGO lead-\ners into government at the Cabinet level as well as in high positions in the bureaucracy. Further,\na number of NGO and PO leaders have run for local office in an attempt to incorporate the prin-\nciples of NGO work into government. Others were elected to Congress through the party list sys-\ntem, allowing unrepresented groups to organize their own political parties catering to their par-\nticular interests. The ADB (1999e) has ranked the Philippines as having \u201cthe most advanced state\nof GO/NGO relations in the region.\u201d\n\nNongovernment organizations and CBOs have many advantages over government agen-\ncies. Being relatively unencumbered by bureaucratic rules and regulations, they possess a flexibil-\nity that government agencies often lack. They work in remote areas (which typically have large\nconcentrations of the poor) that the government often cannot reach. They also stress participatory\nand integrated approaches, encouraging the poor to contribute their views and involvement at\nevery stage, from planning to implementation and to monitoring and evaluation. Even the oft-\nstated shortcoming of NGOs, viz, that they operate at a relatively small scale and therefore cannot\n\n35\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nmake a difference, is misleading, since an important function of NGOs is to innovate and set up\nmodels for emulation.\n\nAdvocacy has been another important activity of NGOs. They have used their experiences\nand  clout  to  influence  governmental  policies  on  poverty  reduction.  NGOs  have  also  sometimes\nappointed themselves to be \u201cwatchdogs\u201d over government actions, devising community-friendly\nsystems for exacting transparency and accountability.\n\nAt the same time, government officials have reason to be critical of NGOs and their activi-\nties. Quick to criticize, some NGOs often do so ignorant of the technical, legal and administrative\nframeworks that guide government decisions. Municipal administrators cite NGO demands for\nimmediate  financial  allocations  covering  housing  schemes  for  the  poor,  for  example,  when  the\nmunicipal budget had been finalized months before. NGOs are often viewed as \u201ctrouble-makers\u201d in\ninciting community based organizations to protest government delays, which are often due to stan-\ndard auditing procedures in the process of implementing pro-poor programs. NGO \u201carrogance\u201d in\ndemanding action and the tendency of some to speak for poor people rather than enable the latter\nto speak for themselves are also criticized.\n\nGovernment officials complain further that NGOs sometimes develop parallel programs in\nhealth or family planning, for example, which unnecessarily duplicate government services and\ncause confusion when the NGOs ask government to take over these services due to funding prob-\nlems.  Moreover, some self-serving individuals (sometimes retired or retrenched government bu-\nreaucrats) have created pseudo-NGOs as mechanisms for tapping into government or donor funds,\nwith no real intention of helping needy people. NGOs have generally taken these criticisms to\nheart and begun collaborating more closely with those government officials who seem to be genu-\ninely interested in pursuing common concerns.\n\nV.  Reforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\nPolitico-administrative institutions\u2014 including policies, structures and processes, both for-\nmal and nonformal\u2014play a fundamental role in the implementation of poverty reduction efforts in\nADCs. How such institutions are designed, developed and reformed, and how administrative ca-\npacities are built and strengthened\u2014the very elements of good governance28\u2014can thus have an\nimportant impact on a country\u2019s poverty reduction efforts.\n\n28 The standard and widely accepted definition of governance is offered by the UNDP (1997) as  \u201c\u2026 the exercise\nof political, economic and administrative authority to manage a nation\u2019s affairs. It is the complex mechanisms,\nprocesses, relationships and institutions through which citizens and groups articulate their interests, exercise\ntheir rights and obligations and mediate their differences.\u201d Four types of governance are identified: economic\ngovernance, political governance, administrative governance, and systemic governance. The concern of public\nsector reform as discussed in this paper is on political governance and mostly on administrative governance.\n\n36\n\n\fSection V\nReforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\nThere are four major areas of reform involving public institutions, namely:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nAdministrative reforms, including reform of the bureaucracy and civil service, that\nimprove the internal rules and restraint mechanisms that promote public-sector effi-\nciency.\nDecentralization that empowers local communities through their local or subnational\ngovernments and provides them opportunities to be heard and to participate in public\ndecision-making institutions and processes.\n\n(iii) Wider citizen participation through the opening of public institutions to the communi-\nties by providing them access to policymaking and service delivery, and enabling their\nparticipation in oversight and accountability mechanisms.\nImproved legal framework for policies and institutions that are primarily committed\nto poverty reduction, including maintenance of law and order.\n\n(iv)\n\nA.\n\nAdministrative Reforms for Poverty Reduction\n\nPublic sector reforms are usually associated with comprehensive changes in the institu-\ntions, organization and processes in the bureaucratic machinery of the state. These changes may\nbe brought about through comprehensive reorganization plans that may include streamlining the\nbureaucracy;  improving  coordination  among  agencies  with  overlapping  functions;  downsizing,\nrightsizing and redeploying personnel;29  improving the salary structures of those working in the\ncivil service; introducing performance management and appraisal; and deregulation, privatization,\nand decentralization of selected bureaucratic functions.\n\nThe implementation of public sector reform is central to improving the processes of gover-\nnance. Administrative reforms can foster economic growth and sustained poverty reduction by\nreducing obstacles to private-sector development that the poorly performing public sector often\ncreates. Such reforms can also increase public resources for priority spending by containing salary\nexpenditures (achieved via cost cutting and bureaucracy downsizing). And finally, administrative\nreforms can contribute to poverty reduction through reduced corruption and increased account-\nability to the poor.\n\nMany  ADCs  have  implemented  administrative  reform  over  the  years,  with  Korea  and\nTaipei,China introducing some of the earliest civil service reforms (Table 3). As would be expected,\nthe  experience  with  administrative  reform  has  been  uneven  across  countries.  The  Republic  of\nKorea launched large-scale administrative reforms in 1961 to orient the bureaucracy to the goal of\n\n29 The three main approaches that can be used to correct the excessive size of bureaucracies and make them more\naccountable are: (a) reconstruction of the internal working of the bureaucracy via competition or by quasi-profit\nincentives to bureaucrats to maximize the surplus of budgets over costs; (b) development of market alternatives\nto government agencies; and (c) political reorganization to make bureaucracies more sensitive to the ultimate\nconsumer and to public opinion (Niskanen 1973).\n\n37\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\neconomic development and poverty reduction. As is well known, Korean development was highly\ninterventionist,  with  the  state  taking  the  primary  responsibility  of  capital  formation,  resource\nallocation, and project selection. This meant that the bureaucracy and civil service had to be heavily\ninvolved in implementing various projects and programs at the micro level. Even in the agricul-\ntural  sector,  for  instance,  there  was  widespread  intervention  by  the  state  in  credit,  education,\ntransportation,  and  even  recreation  (Aqua  1981).  Saemaul undong  was  a  comprehensive  rural\ndevelopment program that the government in cooperation with NGOs began in 1970 to raise the\nrural standard of living. The program, which espoused \u201cdiligence, self-help, and cooperation\u201d as its\nmotto, was designed to increase farm incomes by improving agricultural infrastructure and seed\nvarieties and applying new farming techniques. Increased farm productivity served as the main\nengine for rural income growth. The Korean state used the bureaucracy to successfully penetrate\ntraditional rural power structures and communal networks in the countryside. Pressure was ex-\nerted on local administrators by the central government to ensure the achievement of saemaul\nundong goals. The result was the transformation of the local bureaucracy from a control-oriented\ninstitution to an action-oriented instrument of developmental change (Brandt and Lee 1981). The\nmain workload of local officials consisted of encouraging and persuading farmers into greater coop-\nerative self-help efforts, rather than enforcing bureaucratic regulations and promoting their own\ninterests. It is estimated that even today, most local officials spend half or more of their time away\nfrom their desks talking to villagers and guiding or inspecting projects (Han 1997).\n\nLike Korea, Taipei,China has reduced poverty dramatically over the past three decades\n(Tsai 2001). Since the mid-1930s, Taipei,China has launched a series of comprehensive adminis-\ntrative reform programs, beginning with the Committee for Studying Administrative Efficiency in\n1934. These were followed by other administrative reform measures initiated by Chiang Kai-Shek\nin the early 1940s called \u201cThree Connected States of Administration\u201d that demonstrated the ad-\nministrative process into the planning, implementation, and evaluation stages. Perhaps the key to\nthe success of the administrative reform initiatives has been good implementation (Sun and Gargan\n1996, Tsai 2001). For instance, toward the late 1950s, a report was made on the number of recom-\nmendations implemented by the various administrative reform committees. A study showed that\n75 of the 88 recommendations for administrative reform were actually implemented. As in Korea,\nthe civil service reforms sought to integrate the civil service firmly into the implementation and\nsuccess of poverty reduction strategies, such as the highly successful Well-To-Do-Program. The\nTaipei,China land reform initiative was another example of a bureaucracy oriented firmly toward\nagricultural development.\n\nOne reason for the success of the Korean and Taipei,China bureaucracies in singlemindedly\npursuing development outcomes has been the insulation of the technocratic elite in charge of policy\nmaking and implementation from the \u201cravages of short-run pork-barrel politics\u201d (Bardhan 2001).30\nDespite their best intentions, other ADCs have found it difficult to bring about such insulation.\n\n30 Of course, as Bardhan (2001) notes, insulation of the technocratic elite can also result in inefficiencies, as it\nmakes \u201c\u2026it difficult to attain flexibility in dealing with changes in technical and market conditions and also\nin correcting wrong decisions.\u201d\n\n38\n\n\fSection V\nReforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\nBangladesh\n\nKorea\n\nLaos\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nTable 3: Administrative Reforms in Selected ADCs\n\nAdministrative Services Reform Committee and the National Pay Commission (1972-1975)\nCommittee on Administrative Reform and the National Pay Commission II (1975-1981)\nMartial Law Committee for Examining Organizational Set-Up 1982\nCommittee for Administrative/Reorganization/Reform 1982\nPublic Administration Efficiency Study, November 1989\nPublic Administration Sector Study in Bangladesh, July 1993\nTowards Better Government in Bangladesh, September 1993\nAdministrative Reorganizing (Nurun Nabi) Committee 1993-1996\nPublic Administration Reform Commission 1997\n\nNational Civil Service Act of 1947\nSupreme Council for National Reconstruction 1961\n\nCommittee for Organization and Personnel 1991\nDepartment of Public Administration 1991\nCommittee for Government Organization Improvement 2000\n\nHaffeez Pasha Report 1997\nCommission on Administrative Restructuring 1999\n\nGovernment Survey and Reorganization Commission 1954-56\nIntegrated Reorganization Plan of 1972\nPresidential Commission of Government Reorganization 1986\nReengineering the Bureaucracy 1992\nPresidential Commission on Effective Governance 1999\n\nTaipei,China\n\nCommittee for Studying Administrative Efficiency 1934\nCommittee for Improvement of Administrative Efficiency 1937\nThree Connected States of Administration 1940\nRegulation for the Structure of Position Classification Planning Committee 1956\nPushing Forth Administrative Reform and Establishing Clean and Efficient Government 2001\n\nThailand\n\nCivil Service Act of 1928\nCivil Service Act of 1975\nCivil Service Act of 1992\n\nViet Nam\n\nDoi Moi 1986 (that included governance reforms)\nPublic Administration Review 2000\n\nSources:  Constructed  from  data  obtained  from  Shelley  (2000),  Ahmed  and  Khan  (1990),  Aminuzzaman  (1992),\n\nThamrongthanyavong (1998), Joong-Yand and Kyung-Bae (1994), Carino (1992), Sun and Gargan (1996), ADB (1999), World\n\nIn Bangladesh, even though various governments have instituted many different adminis-\ntrative reforms and committees over the years (e.g., nearly six different sets of reforms between\n1971 and 1985), there has been little noticeable change in the civil service (Ahmed and Khan 1990,\nSiddiqi 1995, Shelley 2000). Among the major recommendations that were repeatedly made by the\nvarious reform committees were improvement in the pay scale of civil servants and decentraliza-\ntion of administration.31  In most cases, however, the key recommendations of the various bodies\n\n31 The  issue  of  decentralization  of  administration  in  Bangladesh  is  further  discussed  in  the  section  on\n\nDecentralization for Poverty Reduction.\n\n39\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nwere either rejected or implemented in radically modified forms (Shelley 2000, Barenstein 1994).\nCentralization, politicization and patronage continue to be important characteristics of public ad-\nministration in Bangladesh (as in many other ADCs).\n\nThe new government of Pakistan has recently embarked on a large effort to reform and re-\nshape the civil service in that country (ADB 2001). It has enhanced the powers of the Federal\nPublic Service Commission and launched a frontal attack on corruption that has included: dis-\nmissal of more than 1,000 civil servants; a comprehensive scheme of interprovincial transfer of\ncivil servants, especially among the District Management Group and the Police; downsizing the\nbureaucracy, including consolidation and merging of ministries, divisions, and departments; full\nreview of civil servant salary structures; and new training and career planning of civil servants,\nincluding performance-based promotions.\n\nViet Nam\u2019s administrative reforms have been part of the overall reform process of doi moi\nthat transformed the Viet Namese economy from a centrally planned system to a market-based\none (UNDP/UNICEF 1996). The government\u2019s strategy has focused on good governance, viz., trans-\nparency and accountability, as an important mechanism to attain stability, economic growth, and\nequity. Among the administrative reforms implemented in Viet Nam are: new provisions requiring\npublic comments on draft laws and regulations before promulgation; new provisions that laws and\nother official instruments will take effect only after being published in the Official Gazette; replac-\ning discretionary licensing with registration and making information on registrations public; pro-\nviding for codification and indexing of all laws and other official instruments; requiring compul-\nsory publication of court judgments; forming a clear distinction between the roles, responsibilities\nand finances of different government agencies (including the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, line minis-\ntries, sectoral ministries, People\u2019s Councils, People\u2019s Committees, and state-owned enterprises);\nprofessionalizing the civil service, including rationalizing salaries, training, with recruitment and\npromotion grounded on merit; and wide-ranging financial management reforms at both national\nand subnational levels of government (World Bank et al.  2000).\n\nWhile it is clear that doi moi as a whole has been very successful in promoting economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction in Viet Nam, it is not clear how much of this success is the result of\nadministrative reforms that have accompanied doi moi and how much is the result of the opening-\nup of the Viet Namese economy. In reality, the two features of doi moi are interrelated, and it is\ndifficult to isolate the effects of each on growth, equity, and poverty reduction. There is little doubt,\nhowever, that administrative reforms have introduced an element of transparency and account-\nability in the workings of the government at all levels. Nevertheless, the problem in Viet Nam, as\nin Lao PDR, is the continued politicization of the civil service, which may serve as an obstacle to\nmeaningful reform. It is difficult for civil servants to be \u201cprofessional\u201d and nonpoliticized within\nthe context of a politico-administrative system dominated by the ruling party (Klaus 1997).\n\n40\n\n\fSection V\nReforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\nB.\n\nDecentralization and Poverty Reduction\n\nDecentralization is a reform relating to the institutions of governance. Broadly speaking, it\nincludes several policy reforms that are designed to transfer rights and responsibilities from cen-\ntral government agencies to local institutions and communities. The reforms include privatization\nand deconcentration or devolution of political, administrative, and fiscal powers.32\n\nA great deal of decentralization around the world has been based on the assumption that\nthe quality of administration and service delivery will improve by shifting decision making and\naccountability closer to communities. Decentralization involves redistributing power from central\nbureaucrats to communities and households, who presumably have a greater stake in the content\nand quality of administration and social services. Proponents of decentralization believe that the\ngranting of power and authority to these stakeholders will make the government more responsive\nto the needs of local communities, and will more fully exploit the knowledge, creativity, and initia-\ntive of agents at the community level.\n\nWhether or not and in what ways decentralization has helped the poor in Asia are impor-\ntant questions. Although decentralization has been experimented with in several Asian countries,\nthe extent, forms and outcomes vary considerably. In several cases, the political dimension has\nbeen a dominant one, and changing political circumstances have shaped the process of decentrali-\nzation. Economic conditions have not been so crucial in decisions. Nor has decentralization been a\nresponse to mass pressure from the grassroots level. It has been usually a top-down process, guided\nmostly by the narrow self-interest of political leaders seeking legitimacy and mass support.33  As a\nresult, devolution has tended to be patchy or has sometimes been reversed. In conditions of ex-\ntreme inequality, it has been unusual for local self-governing institutions to be captured by the\nelite. But, at the same time, there has been a few cases that benefited the poor.\n\n1.\n\nThe Political Economy of Decentralization\n\nDecentralization essentially involves distribution of power and resources, both among dif-\nferent levels of the state and among different interests in their relationship to ruling elites, locally\n\n32 Deconcentration refers to the dispersal of agents of higher levels of government into lower levels of decision\nmaking.  Decentralization, on the other hand, involves devolution of political, administrative, and fiscal powers.\nDevolution of all these powers may not occur simultaneously or may occur in varying degrees.\n\n33 Manor (1999) is emphatic that \u201cno set of economic conditions has been a particularly important cause of decisions\nto decentralize.\u201d  Instead, these have been more decisively influenced by the \u201chard-nosed calculations of self-\ninterest\u201d of political leaders.  Moreover, \u201cmost decentralizers have conceived and implemented these reforms\nfrom above, on their own initiative, relatively free of pressure from below.\u201d  Smoke (1999), however, has a broader\nand more persuasive view.  In the Asian context, he notes, in some cases, international donor pressure without\nnational commitment has been a key factor, while, in other cases, internal political and/or economic crises have\nplayed an important role, sometimes resulting in \u201cquick-fix\u201d decentralization programs that are neither carefully\ndesigned nor sustainable.\n\n41\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nas well as nationally (Crook and Sverrison 1999). The nature of the politics of central-local rela-\ntions is therefore critical to decentralization. There are two key elements: (i) configuration of the\nlocal power structure and (ii) sources of the power bases of the national ruling elite.\n\nAn issue connected with the first element is whether capture of local governments by the\nlocal elites is inevitable, given an antagonistic relationship between them and the dominated groups\n(i.e., the poor and vulnerable). Some evidence from the Indian state of West Bengal points to a\ncomplex relationship (Echeverri-Gent 1993). In a competitive political system, the ruling Commu-\nnist Party consolidated its position by forming a broad-based alliance of the poor, middle peasants\nand salariat, and in the process supplanted the old landlord class.34\n\nThe role of the second key element, the interrelationships between national and local elites,\nis no less complex. Three distinct scenarios are: (i) the ruling elite or central authority seeks to\nbuild its power bases through an alliance with regional/local elites that are supportive of its inter-\nests and enjoy some autonomy; (ii) the central elite challenges or circumvents locally powerful\ngroups; and (iii) the ruling elite consolidates its position in a society where local elites do not have\nsignificant autonomous power (Crook and Sverrisson 1999). In the first scenario, there is bargain-\ning and cooptation, and devolution of power and allocation of resources. Pro-poor outcomes are\nunlikely in this case. Many military regimes have sought to legitimize themselves in this way (e.g.,\nGhana in 1989-1992, Chile from 1975), as have established party regimes aiming to consolidate\nsupport (e.g., Colombia during the 1980s). In the second scenario, there is ideological rivalry, class\nand ethnic conflict, and deep distrust between elites at different levels of government. The chal-\nlenge to entrenched regional/provincial elites may follow a popular revolution (as in post-Marcos\nPhilippines) or the coming to power of social democratic or communist parties (as in the Indian\nstates of West Bengal or Kerala). Poverty reduction in this case might typically be achieved by a\ncentrally funded antipoverty strategy, with the implementation assigned to decentralized bodies\nin a tightly controlled framework. In the third scenario, decentralization is predominantly of the\ndeconcentration type, indicative of the power and effectiveness of the regime down to the local\nlevel. While pro-poor outcomes are not ruled out under this scenario, there is a danger of consoli-\ndating a system of corrupt patronage-based linkages (as in Bangladesh in the late 1980s and early\n1990s).\n\n2.\n\nDecentralization, Poverty Reduction, and Nature of the Political Regime\n\nThe nature of the political regime in a country matters greatly to the success or failure of\ndecentralization in bringing about pro-poor outcomes (Kohli 1987). A good illustration of this is the\ncase  of  the  Indian  state  of  West  Bengal.  In  1978,  a  leftist  coalition,  the  Left  Front,  led  by  the\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), came to power in West Bengal. In order to challenge\n\n34 This is termed as the \u201cpolitical patronage hypothesis\u201d by Echeverri-Gent (1993), according to which representative\ndemocratic participation generally results in the growth of organizations that capture the resources available\nto them, and are pushed by electoral logic to mediate the interests of the poor within a broader support base.\n\n42\n\n\fSection V\nReforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\nthe power of the Congress party and the landlord classes in the rural areas, the Left Front sought\nto  create  a  strong  base  by  devolving  the  implementation  of  development  programs  to  village\npanchayats (councils) and by mobilizing the poor to participate in them. Empowerment of poor and\nlandless peasants was meant to give mass support to the CPI-M\u2019s radical agrarian reform pro-\ngram. This program was designed to restructure the semifeudal basis of rural society via redistri-\nbution and protection of sharecroppers.\n\nSeveral indicators confirm pro-poor aspects of the devolution. In Birbhum District, for ex-\nample, the proportion of village panchayat members belonging to \u201cScheduled Castes and Sched-\nuled Tribes\u201d (SC/ST) (i.e., backward castes and tribes) rose from 34 percent in 1977 to 41.5 percent\nin 1988. In 1988, nearly 45 percent of all village panchayat members were either small peasants,\nsharecroppers, or agricultural laborers, or a combination of these (Lieten 1988). Female participa-\ntion, however, remained low.\n\nHigher representation of the poor did not, however, imply greater participation in panchayat\nmeetings. SC/ST members seldom spoke, and when they did they were ignored (Westergaard 1986).\nBut there were other changes that compensated the poor or the disadvantaged, such as an expan-\nsion of employment opportunities and higher agricultural wage rates. A survey revealed that a\nvast majority (78 percent) of landless men attributed significant changes to the panchayat system,\nas  did  a  larger  majority  (84  percent)  of  SC/ST  respondents.  The  female  respondents  were  less\nappreciative (Webster 1992).\n\nA counter-example is provided by the experience of Bangladesh. Decentralization intro-\nduced by President H. M. Ershad in 1985 was designed to legitimize his military regime and to\nbuild  support  for  a  newly  created  party,  the  Jatiya  Party  (Crook  and  Manor  1998,  Crook  and\nSverrisson 1999). Rural landed elites and power brokers were co-opted to build a political power\nbase, with limited power sharing. Two tiers of elected local councils were created. The first tier\ncomprised the directly elected Union Councils with populations of around 20,000. Above them in\nthe second tier were the Sub-district (upazila) Councils with an average population of 245,000.35\nThe new system thus combined elements of deconcentration and devolution. The Councils were\nlargely dependent on central funds as they lacked revenue-raising powers.\n\nThere were no reservations or quotas for the poor or the disadvantaged.36  As a result, both\nthe Union and Sub-district Councils were dominated by the affluent landed classes, and the land-\nless were excluded. Most of the affluent Sub-district Chairmen spent much of their time in Dhaka,\nnetworking with influential politicians and civil servants. Soon after they were elected, 55 percent\nof the Chairmen joined the Jatiya Party.\n\n35 The  subdistrict  councils  included  indirectly  elected  Union  Chairmen,  various  appointees,  heads  of  newly\n\ndeconcentrated ministries at the subdistrict level, and a directly elected Chairman.\n\n36 There was, however, provision for the appointment of three women at the subdistrict level, but without any\nvoting rights. In a total of 4,401 council persons, six women served as Union Chairwomen, with their husbands\nexercising the real authority.\n\n43\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nA survey of rural residents revealed that a majority of them knew little about the upazila,\nand very few had attended any council meetings (Ingham and Kalam 1992). Another survey found\nthat 64 percent of village residents were \u201cnot at all satisfied\u201d with either the Union or the upazila\ncouncils, largely because of the corrupt and dictatorial behavior of their political leaders (Crook\nand Manor 1998). In the Ingham and Kalam survey, 75 percent of the elite respondents felt that\nNGOs and voluntary associations had performed better than local governments, and 90 percent\nclaimed to have had personal experience of corruption. Much of the funding of the councils was\ndevoted to patronage-related activities that did not benefit the poor. But in some cases, especially\nthose  involving  infrastructure,  projects  chosen  by  the  Councils  were  congruent  with  expressed\nneeds of village respondents (Crook and Manor 1998).\n\nWhatever the gains to the Ershad regime of co-opting the local elites and power brokers\nthrough decentralization, these did not last long. In the 1990 elections, 90 percent of the upazila\nchairmen were rejected by the electorate, and a year later the regime itself collapsed. 37\n\nA third illustration of how political regimes matter to the poverty outcomes of decentraliza-\ntion is offered by the experience of the Philippines. Decentralization was ushered in the Philip-\npines with the passage of the landmark Local Government Code in 1992 (LGC 1992) in accordance\nwith the 1987 Constitution. It curtailed the policy-making authority of both the President and the\nlegislators in important ways. The salient features of the Code (Brillantes 1998, Eaton 2001) were:\n\n(i) Devolving responsibility for the providing basic services (such as health, social welfare,\nenvironment, education, agricultural research and extension, and public works) and\nthe corresponding expenditures to local governments;\n\n(ii) Devolving  certain  regulatory  functions  such  as  reclassification  of  agricultural  land,\ninspection of food products, implementation of laws relating to environment and building\ncodes;\n\n(iii) Providing representation for NGOs and People\u2019s Organizations in local special bodies\n\nsuch as local development councils, local health boards, and local school boards;\n\n(iv) Enhancing financial resources available to local governments through (a) automatic\nrevenue sharing procedures in place of the previous system of negotiated transfers; (b)\ngiving local governments more autonomy in deciding how to use the additional revenues;\n(c) broadening of their powers to levy taxes and fees; (d) increased internal revenue\nallotments from 11 to 40 percent; and (d) sharing of national wealth (e.g., mines, forestry\nand fisheries) in their respective areas; and\n\n(v) Fostering  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  of  local  government  units  by  enabling  them  to\nborrow  in  the  market  (by  floating  bonds),  to  enter  into  build-operate-transfer\narrangements with the private sector, and in general to adopt a competitive business\noutlook.\n\n37 For a review of why more recent attempts at decentralization did not serve the poor better, see Westergard\n\nand Alam (1995) and Khan (1999).\n\n44\n\n\fSection V\nReforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\nThe LGC transferred significant powers, authority, and resources (including financial) to\nthousands of local governments throughout the country. After a decade of implementation, most\nobservers agree that the Code has indeed unleashed the potentials in the countryside long held\nhostage by a highly centralized government. It has empowered many local communities to build\nlocal infrastructure such as public housing, address environmental concerns, make health and\neducation  services  more  accessible,  and  enhance  opportunities  for  people  to  participate  in\ngovernance. Whether all this has measurably brought down poverty is not very clear yet, however.\n\n3.\n\nFiscal Decentralization\n\nAn important consideration in devolving taxation power to local authorities is to encourage\ngreater fiscal responsibility and a stake in the cost-effectiveness of public expenditure. Some\npotential effects of such devolution may, however, cause inefficiencies and inequities. If there is\na great deal of mobility between local jurisdictions, differences in taxes could misallocate the mobile\nfactors. Inequities, on the other hand, may arise due to differences in fiscal capacities and preferences\nfor redistribution. There is thus need for central control to harmonize the tax system, achieve a\nfairer redistribution, and reduce tax collection costs. For these reasons, central governments in\ndeveloping countries tend to retain control over direct taxes that apply to mobile factors (e.g.,\ncapital) and which redistribute wealth (e.g., progressive taxation of income, wealth, and gifts).\nSome taxes are collected centrally, partly because of lower collection costs, but shared with lower\nlevels of government.38 ,39  When there is a myriad array of subnational taxes (a case in point being\ndifferent sales taxes at the state level in India), there may be large efficiency gains from harmonizing\nthe taxes.40\n\nIn contrast, expenditure assignments are more decentralized than revenue collection. How-\never, there is often a vertical fiscal imbalance. As a result of economies of scale in tax collection by\ncentral governments and geographic concentration of economic activities, few local governments\nhave  access  to  elastic  sources  of  tax  revenue.  They  are  thus  perpetually  dependent  on  central\ngovernments for transfers and grants, and this restricts their financial autonomy. Transfers and\ngrants are designed to correct fiscal imbalances, reflect externalities (i.e., the interests that resi-\ndents of other localities have in the spending decisions of a particular authority, e.g., in road build-\ning), and help equalize across different localities. Specific forms of transfers and grants include\nconditional or matching grants, unconditional grants, and earmarking.\n\n38 On the general principles of tax assignments, see Bird (1999) and Oates (1999).\n39 Until recently, the PRC differed from other developing countries in so far as local governments collected most\n\nof the revenues and \u201cshared up\u201d (Bardhan 1997).\n\n40 For a detailed exposition of this and the preceding issues, see Bardhan (1997).\n\n45\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nThe case of Viet Nam offers an important example in the area of fiscal decentralization.\nBefore 1997, the fiscal system was centralized and rigid, with hardly any provision for local initia-\ntive in providing public services. Delivery of public services to the poorer districts and communes\nwas unsatisfactory, as the provinces made subprovincial allocations. Inevitably, therefore, these\nservices were financed by contributions from the local community, resulting in a regressive sys-\ntem.\n\nIn 1997, a New Budget Law, which provided a legal framework for the budgetary process\nand  defined  the  functions  and  sources  of  revenue  of  different  government  agencies,  went  into\neffect. The budgetary process integrated revenues and expenditures at all levels of government\u2014\na change from the past when the state budget included only those expenditures of the communes\nthat were financed from the revenues devolved by the provinces or districts. The Law brought a\nmeasure of fiscal stability by implementing a system of assignments and transfers that were to\nremain unchanged for 3-5 years. While the revenue from tax assignments would automatically\nadjust to changes in prices and GDP, cash transfers were to be adjusted in accordance with prices\nand GDP every year. In addition, the Law linked the revenue assignment at each level of govern-\nment  to  the  expenditure  responsibilities,  and  formalized  levy  of  charges,  fees,  surcharges,  and\ncollection of voluntary contributions by local governments.\n\nThere is some evidence that suggests that disparities in government expenditure, espe-\ncially on social services like health and education, have widened across poor and rich provinces in\nrecent  years  (World  Bank  2000d).  However,  it  is  not  clear  whether  this  has  been  due  to  fiscal\ndecentralization per se or due to the general process of liberalization and deregulation of the Viet\nNamese economy. Likewise, national household survey data over two time periods suggest that\n\nFigure 7.

While there may be several factors respon-\nsible for this, fiscal decentralization had probably something to do with this trend.\n\nThe PRC\u2019s experience with fiscal decentralization was very different than Viet Nam\u2019s. Dur-\ning the 1980s, the Chinese fiscal system underwent significant changes. A unitary system, in which\nthe central government had absolute control over revenue collection and budget appropriation,\nwas converted into a decentralized arrangement in which the revenues were shared by the central\nand provincial governments. Under this arrangement, most of the provincial governments were\nrequired to remit a portion of their budget revenues to the central government. The provinces that\nwere unable to cover the unspecified expenditures received subsidies. Similar fiscal arrangements\nwere made between successive tiers of governments at lower levels.\n\nA major change occurred in 1985.41  Although revenues were still divided into three catego-\nries\u2014central fixed, local fixed, and shared42\u2014the criteria for division changed. While the previous\ndivisions were based primarily on the ownership of state enterprises, the new divisions reflected\ntax categories.43  In this arrangement, central and local fixed revenues accounted for a relatively\nsmall part of the total government budget, and the shared revenue for a substantially larger part.\nThis meant that the central government now relied on local governments to mobilize more rev-\nenues. Since the latter could retain a share, it was in their interest to raise more revenues. An\neconometric  analysis  confirms  a  significant  effect  of  fiscal  decentralization  on  per  capita  GDP\ngrowth.44  Specifically, the growth rate rose by 3.6 percentage points in response to a fiscal reform\nthat raised the marginal retention rate of budgetary revenue from 0 to 100 percent. This finding is\nconfirmed in alternative specifications, involving different lags between growth rates and fiscal\ndecentralization, reverse causality, and inclusion/exclusion of subsidies. It appears that fiscal de-\n\n41 Five types of sharing schemes were enacted in 1988, compared with four during 1985-1987. For details, see\n\nLin and Liu (2000).\n\n42 Under an initial revenue-sharing arrangement enacted in 1980, revenues were classified into central fixed\nrevenues (e.g., customs duties, revenues remitted by centrally owned state enterprises); local fixed revenues\n(e.g., agricultural taxes, revenues remitted by locally owned state enterprises, etc.), and central-local shared\nrevenues (e.g., profits of large-scale enterprises under dual leadership of central and local governments).  Subsidies\nwere provided for the poor and remote regions.\n\n43 The changes in the fiscal system were driven by three factors. One was the emergence of nonstate-owned\nenterprises (township and village enterprises, joint ventures, private firms) with substantial revenue-generating\npotential.  Since state enterprises had become a drain on the fiscal system, the central government was forced\nto turn to alternative sources of revenue such as nonstate-owned enterprises. Another was the greater local\nautonomy as a consequence of economic liberalization. It was thus natural for subnational governments to\ndemand fiscal decentralization commensurate with their greater political autonomy. The third factor was\nessentially economic. Unless incentives are combined with local autonomy, local resource mobilization is likely\nto be sluggish.\n\n44 Using a production function approach, a two-way fixed effects error component model is estimated. The estimation\nis based on panel data from 28 of the 30 provinces in the PRC for the period 1970-1993. A distinctive feature\nof this analysis is the use of a marginal retention rate as a measure of decentralization, as opposed to the\naverage share of government budgetary revenue retained by a province. For other details of the econometric\nanalysis, see Lin and Liu (2000).\n\n47\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\ncentralization contributed to growth through an improvement in resource allocation efficiency and\nnot so much by inducing more investment. To the extent that growth of income is associated with\npoverty reduction, it follows that the impact of fiscal decentralization on poverty was not insignifi-\ncant.45  But there is some evidence in the PRC as well that points to a growing disparity in provi-\nsion of social and economic services at the local level between rich and poor regions.\n\n4.\n\nIncentives, Accountability, and Capture\n\nIncentive-compatible organizational structures contribute greatly to the smooth and effec-\ntive functioning of local governments. The decentralization experiences of different Indian states\nhighlight this issue well. India introduced the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1993 to revi-\ntalize  the  panchayats  with  a  key  role  in  rural  development.  This  amendment  is  an  important\nlandmark, as it provides for a uniform three-tier structure of panchayats at district, block, and\nvillage levels; mandatory elections every five years; proportional representation of backward castes\nand tribes; a quota for women; periodic auditing of accounts; and specification of areas of responsi-\nbility of the panchayats at the three levels. As these are broad guidelines, each state was required\nto modify its existing Acts accordingly, with some discretionary elements.46  The village or gram\npanchayat has a major role in implementing two antipoverty programs, the Integrated Rural De-\nvelopment Program or IRDP (a credit subsidy program) and Jawahar Rozgar Yojana or JRY (a\nrural public works program).47  As the new structure was implemented, serious aberrations came\nto light, based on a review of state conformity Acts and their implementation in the three states of\nUttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.48\n\na.\n\nIncentives\n\nA somewhat glaring weakness of the panchayat system in India is the absence of incentives\nfor the bureaucracy to serve the interests of elected panchayat members. Given unsettled political\nconditions, the bureaucracy took full advantage of its privileged position to divest village panchayats\nof virtually all their major responsibilities in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Out of all areas assigned to the\npanchayats in the UP Act, only rural sanitation was assigned to them. That the bureaucracy could\noverextend its domain in violation of the state Act had a lot to do with an unstable party coalition\n(between the Samajwadi Janta Party and Bhartiya Janta Party) and unsettled conditions in the\n\n45 For an exposition of why the range of the elasticities is so large, see Gaiha (2001a).\n46 A broad specification of areas of responsibility at different levels of the panchayats is given in the 11th Schedule\n\nof the Indian Constitution, added following the 73rd (amendment) Act.\n\n47 While the gram panchayats are assigned a key role in implementing the JRY, especially the wage employment\n\ncomponent, their role in the context of the IRDP is limited to identification of beneficiaries.\n\n48 For details, see Gaiha et al. (2000).\n\n48\n\n\fSection V\nReforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\nhill areas. More generally, this points to a limitation of the Crook-Sverrisson framework (1999) in\nwhich a distinct role for the bureaucracy is not identified.\n\nIn another state, Karnataka, the absence of incentives for different levels of the panchayats\nto  function  in  a  coordinated  manner  allowed  higher  levels  of  panchayats  to  reassign  all  major\nresponsibilities between them, reducing village panchayats to a nearly inconsequential role.\n\nWeak accountability of village panchayats  contributed to their capture by a few function-\naries of panchayats and local administration, through a tight control over information relating to\nantipoverty and other development programs. In sharp contrast, an incentive structure designed\nfor the competitive and profitable functioning of town and village enterprises (TVEs) in the PRC in\nthe 1980s and early 1990s produced spectacular results. Partly to curb rural-urban migration, the\ncentral government sought to promote rural industrialization by allowing local communities to\norganize their own enterprises. Through their interaction with the administration, community\nleaders were able to obtain information on profitable opportunities and access credit and other\nresources for promoting the TVEs. In the process, local governments in successful coastal prov-\ninces became self-reliant and fiscally prudent (Bardhan 1996).\n\nAnother example of an imaginative use of incentives is the Korean irrigation system that\nrelies  on  locally  recruited  patrollers  who  are  also  the  end-users  themselves.  They  thus  have  a\nstrong  incentive  to  perform  well  and  to  prevent  water  theft  and  regulate  its  use  (Wade  1994).\nLikewise, Taipei,China\u2019s irrigation systems are among the best in the world, with much of their\nefficiency arising from the institutional arrangement that ensures a high degree of cooperation\nand coordination between irrigation officials and farmers (Law 1996).\n\nb.\n\nAccountability\n\nAlthough there is some overlap between incentives and accountability mechanisms, the\nlatter are a subset of the former and may even be mandatory. Accountability of the panchayats\ncould be viewed from two perspectives: that of the funding and higher authorities and that of the\nlocal community. In either case, accountability has financial and administrative aspects. Here, the\nfocus is on the financial aspects.\n\nThe state Acts emphasize financial accountability of the panchayats to the funding author-\nity and not so much to the community. This is reflected in the importance given to financial report-\ning, preparation of budgets, and auditing of accounts at each level of the panchayat. The concern is\nnot limited to the balancing of the revenue and expenditure but extends to compliance of expendi-\nture with the guidelines/norms prescribed by higher authorities for various schemes. For example,\nthe distribution of expenditure on the JRY between wages and material costs must be 60:40. It is,\nhowever, debatable whether adherence to such rigid norms has any economic justification. Fur-\nther, as a consequence, the limited autonomy panchayats are permitted tends to delay implemen-\ntation. Serious doubts persist about the accountability of the village panchayat to the village sabha,\ndespite the key role assigned to the latter and specification of its power and functions.\n\n49\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nc.\n\nCapture\n\nA survey of three districts in UP that focused on the implementation of two major antipoverty\nprograms (the JRY and IRDP) in 1997 points to the pervasiveness of rent-seeking behavior in all\nthe village panchayats (Gaiha et al. 1998, 2000). There were large-scale diversions of resources by\nthe chairpersons, panchayat secretaries, and village-level workers for personal gain. As a result,\nthe benefits of the JRY, IRDP, and other rural development programs to the poor were minimal.\nFor example, instead of the village assembly identifying the beneficiaries for the IRDP, the\nchairpersons selected them, often in exchange for bribes. Lack of awareness of various antipoverty\nprojects, weak accountability mechanisms in the village community, and a local power structure in\nwhich the upper castes (especially Brahmins and Thakurs) were dominant and the poor lacked\norganization, were all responsible for the status quo being maintained. Excessive pessimism and\nfear of violence among the poor and other vulnerable sections virtually eliminated any prospect of\norganized protest or resistance. It is ironic that large segments of the rural population continue to\nbe at the mercy of a few powerful groups despite a drastic overhaul of the panchayats, following\nthe  73rd  Constitutional  Amendment  Act,  which  was  designed  principally  to  ensure  greater\nparticipation of the weak and powerless, such as members of the backward castes and tribes.\n\n5.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nA major problem faced by decentralization efforts is that in most ADCs newly formed local\ngovernments have very weak capacities of governance. This can sometimes be dangerous and lead\nto misuse when substantial spending decisions are devolved from the central to the local level. It is\nimperative therefore for capacity to be built at the local government level before or concurrently\nwith devolution of fiscal and administrative powers to the local level.\n\nThe Japanese experience in decentralization is instructive in this regard. The Ministry of\nHome Affairs (MoHA) of Japan has played a key role in managing a process of \u201dcontrolled decen-\ntralization\u201d in Japan since the end of the Second World War (Akizuki 2001). The MoHA adminis-\nters the local allocation tax, which is a revenue-sharing scheme that covers about 20 percent of all\nrevenues of local governments. This allows it to keep an eye on local governments and quickly\ndetect excessive spending and mismanagement. The MoHA is empowered to monitor, direct, and\nsanction local governments for that purpose, and puts pressure on local governments to balance\ntheir budgets.\n\nBut the most interesting feature of Japanese decentralization relates to the intergovern-\nmental  exchange  of  personnel.  Civil  servants  in  the  MoHA  are  expected  to  go  through  unique\ncareer paths that involve stints in both the MoHA central ministry as well as the local prefectural\ngovernments. Upon return to the MoHA, many are transformed into advocates of the causes of\nlocal governments. Personnel exchanges between various levels of government provide a powerful\nmeans of communication, oversight, and capacity building (Akizuki 2001, Inoki 2001, Inatsugo\n2001).\n\n50\n\n\fSection V\nReforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\nC.\n\nParticipatory Governance\n\nParticipation is defined as \u201c\u2026a process through which stakeholders influence and share\ncontrol over development initiatives and the decisions and resources that affect their lives\u201d (Fowler\n1997). The participation of citizens in the different phases of poverty reduction programs\u2014be it at\nthe conceptualization, design, implementation, or evaluation stages\u2014can lead to the choice of ap-\npropriate projects and make efforts at decentralization effective (Sen 2001, Narayan et al. 2000,\nWorld Bank 1996). While decentralization in principle should lead to greater citizen and commu-\nnity participation, in practice this has not always been the case.\n\nParticipation can be operationalized through various mechanisms. This could include con-\nsultations (direct or indirect) and partnerships with the citizens in various phases of the project\ncycle, from project identification, to design, implementation, and to evaluation.\n\nAn illuminating example of citizen participation for good governance is Governance Score\nCard project pioneered by the Public Affairs Center in the Indian city of Bangalore (Paul 1997,\nWorld Bank 2001a). The project, instituted by the city in partnership with several local commu-\nnity-based organizations, seeks to assess the efficiency and adequacy of government services from\nthe recipients\u2019 point of view. Users of municipal services are asked to evaluate and provide feed-\nback on the quality of delivery of basic services, including general urban services, health, and the\npublic distribution system (i.e., food subsidies). The score card approach has introduced a measure\nof accountability, transparency, and competition in the municipal bureaucracy in Bangalore, and\nhas been generally regarded as a successful initiative. It is being replicated in several other Indian\ncities.\n\nAnother example of citizen participation in governance for poverty reduction is the Saemaul\nUndong movement in Korea.49  Mobilized by the spirit of self-help and voluntary labor among the\npoor, millions of rural people in Korea have participated in the movement since the early 1970s\nresulting in the construction of thousands of hectares of rural roads, rural houses, roads and irri-\ngation systems. After initially being a government-driven movement in the 1970s, the Saemaul\nUndong was eventually privatized in the 1980s and has continued to enhance resident participa-\ntion in regional and social development programs. Consequently, it has provided the context and\nbasis for decentralization and local autonomy (Kee-Ok 1993).\n\nA comparative analysis of community involvement in the delivery of primary education in\ntwo Indian and Chinese villages\u2014the village of Palanpur in Uttar Pradesh and the village of She\nTan in Zhejiang province\u2014is provided by Dreze and Saran (1995). Palanpur has no effective vil-\nlage council or village government that could perform a supervisory function for the local school,\nand act as an intermediary between the district administration and the village community. The\ncaste-based fragmentary politics at the village level also prevents collective action or the develop-\nment of responsive institutions. As a result, education in Palanpur has been neglected over several\n\n49 Sae means \u201cnew\u201d and suggests innovativeness; maul means \u201cvillages.\u201d\n\n51\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\ngenerations, and the female literacy rate has increased from 6 percent in 1981 to only 8 percent in\n1991.50  In She Tan, in contrast, there is a village government and a party organization that re-\nspond to the community\u2019s concerns and needs. In fact, they have been effective in improving the\nschool\u2019s functioning and disciplining of wayward teachers. In contrast to Palanpur, She Tan has\nachieved impressive literacy rates in 1978, with little bias against female education. Despite a\nresource crunch following the introduction of the household responsibility system, school enroll-\nment rates in 1993, as in 1978, were maintained at close to 100 percent.51  Community participa-\ntion in basic education can explain a large portion of the difference in educational outcomes across\nthe two villages.52\n\nD.\n\nLegal Framework and Poverty Alleviation\n\nAnother element of good governance is the rule of law. The legal framework affects poverty\nalleviation indirectly via its effect on economic growth. There is a wealth of evidence showing that\ninvestment and economic growth rates across countries are positively correlated with the effec-\ntiveness of the legal system (Barro 1994, Knack and Keefer 1994, Mauro 1995, Sachs and Warner\n1995). However, the legal system, which includes both the type of laws in place and  the enforce-\nment of these laws, also directly affects poverty reduction. A case in point is land reform, one of the\nmost important policy tools for asset redistribution and poverty reduction. While there are many\nfactors determining the success of land reform, the existence of an appropriate legal framework for\nland reform and land redistribution is essential to successful implementation. Given that land\nrights held by the poor are often very insecure, the legal system can enhance the ability of the poor\nto utilize and invest in land that they cultivate by giving them clearly defined land (title) rights,\nresolving land disputes expeditiously and fairly, and protecting them against \u201cland grabbing.\u201d\n\nAnother example of laws relevant to the poor are affirmative action laws and laws against\ndiscrimination. Many of the poor\u2014women, ethnic and religious minorities, low castes, orphans,\nand the elderly\u2014frequently face discrimination in the labor, land, and housing markets and in\neducational opportunities. Indeed, in some countries, the traditional legal system explicitly con-\nstrains women from owning land, inheriting parental assets, and bequeathing assets to their chil-\ndren. Obviously, such laws perpetuate discrimination and poverty. A reformed legal system that\nprotects the rights of disadvantaged groups and ensures the full participation of every citizen in\neconomic and social activity can be a powerful means of helping the poor. In some cases, the legal\nsystem (via affirmative action laws) can even attempt to compensate disadvantaged groups for\n\n50 The male literacy rate did not increase much either, from 28 percent in 1981 to 33 percent in 1991 (Dreze and\n\nSharan 1995).\n\n51 Under the household responsibility system, incomes derived from production are earned by households and\nnot by the collective. Also, there are stringent limits to the village government\u2019s power to tax. As a result, the\nfinancial basis of social services at the village level has weakened considerably (Dreze and Sharan 1995).\n52 The resources available for basic education, as well as the value systems of households toward education, also\n\ndiffer significantly across the two villages (Dreze and Sharan 1995).\n\n52\n\n\fSection V\nReforming Public Institutions for Poverty Reduction\n\npast injustices by entitling them to special quotas in, say, government hiring and university ad-\nmissions.\n\nIn some countries, such as India, the executive and legislative systems have vested citizens\nwith substantive legal rights, including the right to a work place, the right to housing, and even (in\nthe state of Maharashtra) the right to employment. Residents of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh\nhave the right to a primary school in their village or community. The elevation of social rights to\nlegally defensible private property rights, combined with the right of citizens to take the state to\ncourt over these rights,53  has empowered the ordinary citizen, especially the poor. Of course, it has\nalso led to a substantial increase in litigation in Indian courts, which in turn has meant long delays\nand reduced access by the poor to legal recourse (Pistor and Wellons 1999).\n\nHow  legal  impediments  can  thwart  beneficiary  participation  in  both  the  operation  and\nmanagement of elementary schools is strikingly illustrated in a case from Pakistan (SPDC 2001).\nFollowing the implementation of the Social Action Program (SAP), school management commit-\ntees (SMCs) were set up in the province of Punjab. These consisted of nine members, of whom\nthree were nominated teachers, three were locally influential persons or social workers, and three\nwere elected parents.54   Fearing domination by outsiders, the SMCs were restricted to teachers\nand parents in a ratio of 1:3. The parents\u2019 representatives were elected. The mandate of the SMCs\nincluded improvements in the quality of school education, checking absenteeism of teachers, main-\ntenance of school buildings, and raising of funds. Each SMC had its own bank account. To ensure\ntransparency, the president of the committee and one elected parent managed the accounts. Moni-\ntoring of teacher performance and attendance led to some improvement in the quality of teaching.\nFunds were mobilized to expand the school facilities and to carry out some improvements in the\nphysical infrastructure of the schools. However, following an attempt to empower SMCs to debit\npay based on performance, the Punjab Teachers\u2019 Association filed a lawsuit to have SMCs declared\nillegal entities. The courts upheld the petition, and the SMCs ceased to function. Thus, an impor-\ntant vehicle of educational decentralization and stakeholder participation in schools was rendered\nnull and void because of the absence of a legal framework.\n\nIn addition to a legal framework, the simple maintenance of law and order is critical for the\npoor (as it is for the nonpoor). When public safety, law and order decline, the incidence of crime\nincreases, and this in turn leads to reduced investments and increase in poverty. The poor in both\nrural and urban areas are particularly vulnerable to crime and the least able to recover from it. As\nsuch, they are the hardest hit by deteriorating law and order and absence of the rule of law.\n\n53 Of course, the vast majority of the poor are probably not even aware of these rights, given the low levels of\n\nliteracy among the poor and their restricted access to information.\n\n54 Initially, there were 12 members. After a year, the number was reduced to nine (SPDC 2001).\n\n53\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\nVI.  Conclusion and Policy Implications\n\nThere is little question that economic growth is critically important to poverty reduction.\nCross-country  differences  in  growth  explain  a  great  deal  of  the  variation  in  poverty  reduction\nperformance of countries. However, growth is not sufficient for poverty reduction. Institutional\nand other factors also matter, as borne out by country studies at the subnational level.\n\nA.\n\nPolitical Will and Commitment\n\nThe primary prerequisite for poverty reduction is political will and commitment on the\npart of the government. The government is the key actor with whom other groups, such as civil\nsociety and international organizations, can cooperate in the fight against poverty. Even in coun-\ntries having a strong and rich tradition of civil society groups and NGOs committed to poverty\nreduction, the reach of these groups to the poor is limited.\n\nBut how is this political will or commitment to be formed? There are no simple answers to\nthis question. Neither democracy nor authoritarianism ensures that the government in power will\nbe  committed  to  poverty  reduction.  What  is  more  critical  is  the  nature  of  interest  groups  and\ndominant coalitions that \u201ccapture\u201d public decision making. Where coalitions of the poor have a\nsignificant influence on policy, a strong political will to eradicate poverty is likely to evolve.\n\nHowever, forming coalitions of the poor may not always be easy, given that they are not\nhomogeneous and have different ideologies. It is possible that various coalitions of the poor with\ndifferent ideologies and agendas could actually work at cross purposes, undermining each other\u2019s\npositive efforts.\n\nProgress can be made on poverty reduction when coalitions of the nonpoor are dominant in\na country.  The government can gain the political support of nonpoor groups by emphasizing the\nbenefits to the nonpoor and society as a whole of poverty reduction policies and programs. Fortu-\nnately, there is increasing awareness of the positive externalities of poverty reduction.\n\nB.\n\nSocial and Cultural Institutions\n\nAll over Asia, there are a number of groups that have been socially, economically, or politi-\ncally excluded from mainstream development for several decades or generations. These include,\ninter alia, the landless, small and marginal tenant cultivators, and indigenous peoples (often eth-\nnic minorities) in the rural areas; likewise, the rural migrants, women (especially widows and\nthose heading households), and children (especially street children, child workers, and orphans) in\nthe urban areas. In addition, there are entire regions or provinces in countries that have been\ntraditionally excluded from social and economic institutions, either because of their geographical\nisolation or because they have large proportions of excluded groups, such as indigenous peoples.\nExclusion is often associated with poverty and has a profound negative impact on the quality of life\nof the excluded.\n\n54\n\n\fSection VI\nConclusion and Policy Implications\n\nGovernments can make special efforts to provide access to land, credit, employment, and\neducational opportunities, as well as access to basic social services, to historically disadvantaged\nand excluded groups. The use of affirmative action policies such as policies that set aside quotas for\nminorities in education, job, or political opportunities may also be called for to reverse decades or\ncenturies of discrimination and exclusion of certain groups.\n\nInformal networks and social relations embedded in the social structures of society or so-\ncial capital are critical for the survival of the poor and demonstrate their resilience in the face of\ndaunting challenges. They can mitigate the impact of social exclusion through mutual helping\nbehavior, and can create a sense of identity and solidarity. The state has an important role to play\nin sustaining people\u2019s social capital as well as in expanding the framework for creative and inclu-\nsive forms of assistance that have a lasting impact on poverty. Specifically, government poverty\nreduction initiatives should not supplant and undermine social and mutual assistance networks\nbut instead build on them.\n\nC.\n\nAdministrative Reform\n\nAdministrative reforms can foster faster economic growth and sustain poverty reduction\nby removing the obstacles to private sector development, increasing public resources for priority\nspending, reducing corruption, and increasing the accountability of the public sector.\n\nWhile many ADCs have undertaken civil service reforms, the implementation leaves much\nto be desired. In general, the civil service remains bloated, slow, and unresponsive to the needs of\nthe poor. In fact, in some situations, the bureaucracy is an impediment to change and poverty\nreduction. This does not mean, of course, that such reforms should not even be attempted; it sim-\nply suggests that civil-service reform will not be easy. Reforms must address the roots of the prob-\nlem, ranging from archaic rules and procedures and stubborn mindsets compounded by generally\nlow salaries in the bureaucracy.\n\nD.\n\nDecentralization\n\nThe  process  of  decentralization  has  been  slow,  uneven,  and  uncertain  in  Asia.  In  most\ncases, it has been a top-down initiative, while in a few cases it has been motivated by a concern for\npolitical legitimacy by nondemocratic regimes. In general, decentralization in Asia has not ben-\nefited the poor except in a few cases. However, its potential for poverty alleviation remains signifi-\ncant, and its failure to help the poor is largely the result of poor design and implementation.\n\nThere are several lessons to be learned from the Asian experiences in decentralization.\nFirst, decentralization is a complex political process as it tends to disrupt the power and privileges\nof influential groups. There is a strong motivation for these groups to capture local government\nagencies for their personal gain, thereby rendering the decentralization process antipoor. Weak-\nening the resistance of the influential groups is therefore essential. This could be achieved through\n\n55\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 10\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING ASIA\n\ngradual decentralization, public discussion, and mass campaigns to highlight the merits of decen-\ntralization.\n\nSecond, to ensure that the poor are included in local governments, it may be necessary to\nset membership quotas for women and other disadvantaged groups in local bodies, to strengthen\nlocal and state-level organizations of the poor, and to facilitate access to information. The latter\nwould also result in greater transparency of local governments and help curb corruption.\n\nThird, administrative decentralization without fiscal devolution is meaningless. At the same\ntime, greater fiscal autonomy to local governments requires (i) a higher share of transfers from\ncentral to local governments as untied grants, (ii) converting these grants into a share of state\nrevenues, (iii) defining through state legislation an equalization formula to allocate grants to local\ngovernments,  and  (iv)  increasing  the  sources  of  local  revenues  through  local  taxation  and  im-\nproved tax collection. Local governments should be also allowed to access capital markets directly\nso that they can mobilize their own resources. Equally important in the context of poverty allevia-\ntion is the need for greater flexibility in designing and implementing centrally sponsored schemes\n(such as rural public works) at the local level. However, there must be periodic audits combined\nwith accountability of outcomes to the local community.\n\nFourth, capacity needs to be built at the local government level. Few local governments\nhave the capacity to identify demand, contract for delivery of services, and target the poor. Local\ncapacity is a must before significant fiscal and administrative powers can be devolved.\n\nE.\n\nParticipatory Governance\n\nParticipatory  governance  has  been  shown  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  services  and\npublic administration, and is likely to help orient institutions toward development and poverty\nreduction. While there are a few innovative examples of a participatory approach to poverty reduc-\ntion in a few ADCs, notably Bangladesh, Philippines, and Thailand, citizen and community partici-\npation in governance are still generally rare in much of Asia.\n\nF.\n\nLegal Framework\n\nA strong legal framework can be a catalyst for innovative and comprehensive poverty re-\nduction  initiatives.  For  instance,  meaningful  progress  on  land  reform    cannot  take  place  until\nthere is such a framework for land redistribution, land title rights, land disputes, and protection\nagainst \u201cland grabbing.\u201d Likewise, a strong legal system is needed to guard against discrimination\nand to protect the rights of the poor.\n\nG.\n\nRole of International Development Organizations\n\nWhat can multilateral agencies, such as the ADB and the World Bank, do to address the\ninstitutional limitations to poverty reduction? Many of the policy options discussed in this paper\n\n56\n\n\fReferences\n\napply not only to governments but also to international organizations. Some of these options are\nalready  being  pursued,  but  more  could  be  done.  For  instance,  there  needs  to  be  much  greater\ninvolvement  of  beneficiaries  and  the  community  in  the  selection,  design,  implementation,  and\nmonitoring of projects. Likewise, partnerships with civil society groups, such as NGOs and CBOs,\ncould be further strengthened. International organizations can also increasingly work with decen-\ntralized local government agencies instead of working solely with central government agencies.\nFurther, it may be useful to move away from narrowly defined project approaches and reorient\nlarger shares of financial and technical assistance to supporting programs of decentralized and\nparticipatory governance, programs that seek to build coalitions of the poor, and programs that\ncombat social exclusion (e.g., affirmative-action programs).\n\n References\n\nADB, 1998.
