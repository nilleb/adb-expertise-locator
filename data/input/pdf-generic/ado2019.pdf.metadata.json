Global trade and economic activity weakened toward the end of\u00a02018, \nslowing growth in many economies in the region. The outlook is cloudy with risks that tilt to the downside. \nA drawn-out trade conflict could undermine trade and investment in the region, and US fiscal policy \nand the consequences of a disorderly Brexit could weigh on growth in the advanced economies and the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China. Though the risk of sharp increases in US interest rates has subsided, policy\u00a0makers \nmust stay vigilant.\nDisasters are shaped by natural hazards and the dynamics of the economy, society, and environment in which \nthey occur. They pose a growing threat to development and prosperity in the region, their consequences \ndisproportionately severe in developing countries, especially for the poor and marginalized. As developing\u00a0Asia \nis home to more than four-fifths of the people affected by disasters globally in the past 2 decades, the \nregion must strengthen its disaster resilience. This means integrating disaster risk reduction into national  SA\ndevelopment and investment plans, spending more on prevention for a better balance with spending on  trengSIA\nrescue and recovery, and pooling risk through insurance and reinsurance. thN\nen D\ningE\n DV\nisaEL\nAbout the Asian Development Bank ster ROPM\ne\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific,   silieEN ASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nncT\nwhile sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

seems to be on a path of moderating growth as a recovery in global \ntrade and economic activity that began in 2017 loses steam. Estimated regional \ngrowth remains robust but slowed in 2018 to 5.9% and is expected to slow further to \n5.7% this year and 5.6% in 2020. Minus the newly industrialized economies, regional \nexpansion at 6.4% in 2018 is envisaged softening to 6.2% this year and 6.1% in 2020. \nAlthough regional inflation crept up slightly to 2.5% last year on rising oil prices and \ncurrency depreciation, it remains well below the 10-year historical average of 3.2%. \nHeadline inflation is forecast to remain at 2.5% in the next 2 years. \nPersistent trade tensions continue to weigh on the region and pose the \nbiggest risk to the forecast. Uncertainty over trade can deter consumption \nand investment. Other potential shocks that could buffet the region include a \nsharper slowdown in the advanced economies or the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nFortunately, policy\u00a0makers in the region are vigilant and ready to respond to shocks. \nWhen\u00a0problems in Argentina and Turkey threw some emerging market currency \nexchanges into turmoil last year, many countries in the region gave their exchange \nrates room to move while tightening policy rates as guardrails against large and \ndisruptive currency movements. As a result, currency adjustments were orderly, \nexchange rates eventually stabilized, and many currencies have since recovered. \nThis\u00a0kind of flexibility with vigilance is the necessary response to avoid disaster in \nan uncertain economic environment.\nAnother kind of disaster that nations must prepare for are those posed by natural \nhazards like cyclones and earthquakes. As documented in the theme chapter from \nwhich this report takes its name, developing Asia suffered from, 2000 to 2018, an \nannual average of nearly 38,000 disaster fatalities. As development patterns and \nclimate change intensify the risks posed by natural hazards, their effects can spread \nacross borders through migration and supply chain links. As a region that routinely \nlives with natural hazards\u2014the home to more than four-fifths of the people affected \nby disasters globally in the past 2 decades\u2014Asia must prioritize strengthening \nits disaster resilience. This can be done in various ways: integrating disaster risk \nreduction into national development and investment plans, spending more on \nprevention for a better balance with spending on response, and pooling risk through \ninsurance and reinsurance, among other strategies.\nAsian Development Outlook 2019 proudly marks 30 years as a publication \nproviding Asian Development Bank economic analysis, forecasts, and policy advice \ntailored to its developing member countries. We in ADB hope to continue influencing \nthe global discourse toward finding lasting solutions to the challenges we share and \nbuilding resilience that will benefit us all.\nTAKEHIKO NAKAO \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank", "Acknowledgments\nAsian Development Outlook 2019 was prepared by staff of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in the Central and West Asia Department, East Asia Department, \nPacific\u00a0Department, South Asia Department, Southeast Asia Department, \nand Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, as well as in \nADB\u00a0resident missions.

Growth in the region is projected to soften \nto 5.7% in 2019 and 5.6% in 2020. Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income newly \nindustrialized economies, growth is expected to slip from 6.4% in 2018 to 6.2% \nin 2019 and 6.1% in 2020.\nAs oil prices rose and Asian currencies depreciated, inflation edged up last year \nbut remained low by historical standards. In light of stable commodity prices, \ninflation is anticipated to remain subdued at 2.5% in both 2019 and 2020.\nRisks remain tilted to the downside. A drawn-out or deteriorating trade \nconflict between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the United States \ncould undermine investment and growth in developing Asia. With various \nuncertainties stemming from US fiscal policy and a possible disorderly Brexit, \ngrowth in the advanced economies could turn out slower than expected, \nundermining the outlook for the People\u2019s Republic of China and other \neconomies in the region. Though abrupt increases in US interest rates appear \nto have ceased for the time being, policy makers must remain vigilant in these \nuncertain times.\nDisaster risk from natural hazards is a growing threat to the development and \nprosperity in the region, and the consequences tend to be more severe in \ndeveloping countries, affecting poor and marginalized people disproportionally. \nHome to more than four-fifths of the people affected by disasters globally in \nthe past 2 decades, developing Asia must prioritize strengthening its disaster \nresilience. Governments should integrate disaster risk reduction into national \ndevelopment and investment plans. Spending more on prevention would bring \na better balance with spending on response and provide better protection to \npeople at risk. Pooling risk through insurance and reinsurance promises to be \ncost-efficient.\nYasuyuki Sawada\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank", "xii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nChallenges from rising headwinds\nGrowth softens as trade tensions persist\n(cid:31) Developing Asia posted strong but moderating growth in 2018. Despite \nrising headwinds, growth in aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) slowed only \nslightly from 6.2% in 2017 to 5.9% in 2018 as global trade and economic activity \ndecelerated at the end of the year, affecting many economies in the region. \nWith\u00a0growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) continuing to moderate, \nregional growth will soften further to 5.7% in 2019 and to 5.6% in\u00a02020. \nExcluding the newly industrialized economies, growth will slow from 6.4% in \n2018 to 6.2% in 2019 and to 6.1% in 2020.\n\u00bb  A slowdown from late 2018 will continue in the advanced economies. \nAggregate growth in the three major advanced economies\u2014the United\u00a0States, \nthe euro area, and Japan\u2014slowed from 2.3% in 2017 to 2.2% in 2018. \nThe slowing trend will likely reach 1.9% in 2019 and 1.6% in 2020 under \nless accommodative fiscal and monetary policies in the US, uncertainty \nsurrounding Brexit in the United Kingdom and the European Union, and the \ntrade conflict between the PRC and US.\n\u00bb  PRC moderation reflects structural factors and financial tightening. \nWith\u00a0the economy maturing, growth in the PRC slowed from 6.8% in 2017 to \n6.6% in 2018 as the government sought to reduce corporate leveraging and \ncontrol financial risks. Growth will moderate further to 6.3% in 2019 and 6.1% \nin 2020 as restrictions on housing markets and shadow banking continue and \nas the trade conflict with the US weakens exports.\n\u00bb  India is set to see growth pick up as consumption strengthens. \nGrowth\u00a0slowed from 7.2% in fiscal 2017 to 7.0% in 2018, with weaker \nagricultural output and consumption growth curtailed by higher global oil \nprices and lower government expenditure. Growth is expected to rebound \nto 7.2% in 2019 and 7.3% in 2020 as policy rates are cut and farmers receive \nincome support, bolstering domestic demand. \n\u00bb  Southeast Asia will sustain growth at close to 5% this year and\u00a0next. \nStrengthening domestic demand will offset weaker export growth. \nStrong\u00a0consumption\u2014spurred by rising incomes, subdued inflation, and \nrobust remittances\u2014should boost economic activity in the subregion. \nExport\u00a0demand, on the other hand, is likely to soften in 2019 in line with the \nweaker global environment and a muted forecast for semiconductor exports, \nbefore picking up slightly in 2020. \n\u00bb  Growth will recover in the Pacific but moderate in Central Asia. Growth\u00a0in \nthe Pacific is set to rebound from a meager 0.9% in 2018 to 3.5% in 2019 \nas liquefied natural gas production in Papua New Guinea, the subregion\u2019s \ndominant economy, returns to full capacity following an earthquake in 2018. \nMeanwhile, lower oil prices and slower growth in the Russian Federation will ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xiii\nweigh on economies in Central Asia. Growth in the subregion is projected to \ndecelerate to 4.2% in both 2019 and 2020 as slowdowns in Kazakhstan and \nTurkmenistan more than offset higher growth elsewhere.\n(cid:31)  Financial conditions in Asia tightened in 2018, but have since improved. \nJitters over emerging markets sparked by Argentina and Turkey in 2018 caused \nregional currencies to depreciate against the US dollar, with the Indian rupee, \nIndonesian rupiah, and Philippine peso most sharply hit. Partly in response, many \ncentral banks in the region hiked their policy rates during the year. Then a pause \nin the tightening of US monetary policy, and some dissipation of concern about \nAsian emerging markets, allowed many regional currencies and equity markets to \nrecover. Capital flows have stabilized. \n(cid:31)  Inflation edged up in 2018 but remains low by historical standards. On the \nheels of rising oil prices and currency depreciation, inflation in developing Asia \npicked up slightly from 2.2% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2018. Despite the increase, \ninflation remains well below the 10-year historical average of 3.2% for the region. \nIt is expected to remain subdued in the coming years. With stable commodity \nprices, headline inflation is forecast unchanged at 2.5% in 2019 and 2020.\n(cid:31)  In a cloudy outlook, risks remain tilted to the downside. The primary risks still \ncenter on the US\u2013PRC trade conflict. Uncertainty is heightened by protracted \nnegotiations and disagreements, which could curtail investment and growth in \nthe region. A possible upside risk to the outlook is that negotiations readily bring \nagreement and lower trade barriers. Beyond the trade conflict, growth in the \nadvanced economies and the PRC may slow by more than expected if Brexit is \ndisorderly, for example, or fiscal policy uncertainty persists in the US. On the \nother hand, the risk from the US abruptly raising the policy rate has subsided \ncompared with 2018, but the risk of financial volatility remains.\nExchange rates affect domestic financial conditions \nthrough financial and trade channels\n(cid:31) Exchange rate uncertainty may bear on regional financial conditions. \nLocal currency depreciation and heightened exchange rate volatility in 2018 \ncould affect borrowing costs for economies in the region. High reliance on \nfunding denominated in US dollars renders countries vulnerable to changing \nglobal financial conditions. Changes to the exchange rate and the sovereign \nbond spread, a measure of domestic financial conditions, closely correlated in \nemerging Asia in 2018. The exchange rate influences financial conditions in \nemerging markets through two competing effects: As a currency depreciates, \nthe trade channel tends to loosen domestic financial conditions by improving \nexternal competitiveness, while the financial channel tends to tighten financial \nconditions by worsening the economy\u2019s balance sheet.\n(cid:31)  Trade and financial channels both affect domestic financial conditions. \nEmpirical analysis of selected economies in emerging Asia shows that changes in \nexchange rates affect sovereign credit risk premiums, which can further influence ", "xiv(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nfinancial conditions through domestic lending rates. Changes to bilateral \nexchange rates against the US dollar affect financial conditions largely through \nthe financial channel, while movements in nominal effective exchange rates act \nvia the trade channel. However, the relative dominance of these two effects \ndepends on circumstances specific to each economy, so policy prescriptions \nshould be tailored individually. \n(cid:31)  Domestic financial resilience can mitigate adverse external influences. \nAn\u00a0appropriate policy mix and regional policy dialogue can strengthen domestic \nfinancial resilience and limit the impact of shocks from external funding \nconditions. Ensuring domestic financial stability is a challenge when external \nfunding conditions are unfavorable. Monetary and macroprudential policies need \nto consider the effects the exchange rate has through both financial and trade \nchannels. More broadly, it is important to cultivate an investor base at home and \ndeepen capital markets in the region, in particular by further developing local \ncurrency bond markets. These policies should go hand in hand with strengthened \npolicy dialogue across borders to monitor macro-financial conditions. Further, \ncapital flow management measures must be considered to mitigate disruptive \nspillover in an increasingly interconnected global financial system. ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xv\nOutlook by subregion\n(cid:31) Growth will moderate in 2019 across most of developing Asia. Only\u00a020\u00a0of \n45 individual economies are projected to see growth accelerate in\u00a02019. \nBy\u00a0subregion, aggregate growth rates in Central Asia, East Asia, and \nSoutheast\u00a0Asia are expected to decelerate, while South Asia and the Pacific \nwill\u00a0bounce back from slowdown in 2018. South and Southeast Asia will grow \nmore quickly in 2020 than in 2019. \n(cid:31)  East Asia slows as the global economy and trade weaken. Economic growth in \nEast Asia decelerated by 0.2 percentage points to 6.0% in 2018, weighed down \nby weakening external trade and moderating investment in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) but sustained by resilient domestic consumption. Growth \nmoderated to 6.6% in the PRC as policies to control risk in the financial sector \nand housing market dampened investment. Unique in the subregion, growth in \nMongolia accelerated to 6.9% on large mining investment. Expansion in the PRC \nshould moderate to 6.3% in 2019 and 6.1% in 2020 as global growth slows and \neconomic policy targets a more sustainable growth trajectory. Growth will slow \nin the rest of the subregion as well in tandem with slower expansion in exports. \nEconomic growth in the whole subregion will thus slide to 5.7% in 2019 and \n5.5% in 2020. Inflation edged up last year as food prices and rents rose in most \nsubregional economies. It will trend down from 2.0% in 2018 to 1.8% in 2019 \nand\u00a02020 as oil prices moderate and rents and food prices stabilize.\n(cid:31)  South Asia bucks the trend of slowing growth in Asia. Growth is expected to \nedge up by 0.1 percentage point, from 6.7% in 2018 to 6.8% in 2019 and again \nto 6.9% in 2020. Subregional averages in South Asia reflect heavy weighting for \nIndia, where growth slipped from 7.2% in 2017 to 7.0% in 2018 as agriculture \nand government expenditure both experienced slower growth and as global \noil prices rose. Growth in India is forecast to pick up a bit to 7.2% in 2019 and \n7.3% in 2020 on recovery in agriculture and stronger domestic demand, with \nreform having strengthened the health of banks and corporations, and as the \nimplementation of a value-added tax makes domestic firms and products more \ncompetitive. Most other countries in South Asia are expected to maintain or \nslightly improve on their high growth rates, with Bangladesh expected to achieve \n8.0% growth in 2019 and 2020. Pakistan and Sri Lanka, however, are currently \nreining in fiscal and external imbalances by implementing a broad range of \neconomic reforms. Inflation in South Asia was stable at 3.7% in 2018 with \nbenign food inflation and despite higher global oil prices. Subregional inflation is \nexpected rise to 4.7% in 2019 and 4.9% in 2020 under pressure from currency \ndepreciation and India\u2019s upward adjustment of some agricultural procurement \nprices to cover higher input costs.\n(cid:31)  Southeast Asia holds steady with some growth moderation. Subregional \ngrowth was marginally lower at 5.1% last year as strong domestic demand \ncountered slowing exports. With weakening global growth, slowing trade, \nand softer commodity prices, export prospects dim further for these highly \ntrade-engaged economies. Continued strength in domestic demand should ", "xvi(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nnevertheless support growth at 4.9% this year and 5.0% next year. In half \nof the 10 subregional economies, growth is forecast to slow this year, while \nIndonesia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic will be unchanged, and \nBrunei Darussalam, Myanmar, and the Philippines will post higher growth. \nStrong consumption, spurred by rising incomes, stable inflation, and robust \nremittances, is underpinning growth in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand, as is foreign investment in Cambodia and Viet\u00a0Nam \nand large infrastructure projects elsewhere. Inflation in the subregion will dip \nmarginally this year before returning to last year\u2019s 2.7%, broadly held in check by \nslowing growth and lower international oil prices, even as some countries hike \nadministered prices. \n(cid:31)  Central Asia will slow again after growth picked up in 2018. Average growth \nin the subregion rose from 4.2% in 2017 to 4.4% last year as higher oil prices \nrestored growth to Azerbaijan and expansion accelerated in Tajikistan and \nUzbekistan, the latter reflecting the authorities\u2019 revision of statistics in prior \nyears. Growth remained unchanged in Georgia and Kazakhstan and slowed \nin Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Turkmenistan, the last reflecting fiscal \ntightening. Growth in the subregion is forecast to slow to 4.2% in both 2019 \nand 2020 with lower average oil prices trimming expansion in Kazakhstan, \nand despite improvement in Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nUzbekistan. With tight monetary policy reducing inflation in Kazakhstan and \nparticularly in Azerbaijan, where the exchange rate stabilized, average inflation \nin the subregion fell from 9.0% in 2017 to 7.9%, despite acceleration in Armenia, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Inflation is projected to slow further to 7.8% in \n2019 and 7.2% in 2020 with further tightening of fiscal policy in Turkmenistan \nand monetary policy in Kazakhstan, as well as slower credit growth in Uzbekistan. \n(cid:31)  The Pacific continues to lag behind other subregions. Low growth at 0.9% in \n2018 once again reflected developments in Papua New Guinea, the predominant \neconomy in the subregion, which grew by a mere 0.2% following an earthquake \nin February that hit output of gold and liquefied natural gas. Timor-Leste, the \nthird largest economy in the subregion, contracted for a second successive year \nas political uncertainty continued to hamper government spending. Nauru also \ncontracted because of downsizing at the Regional Processing Centre for asylum \nseekers. With recovery in Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste and continued \ngrowth in the other economies, subregional growth is forecast at 3.5% in 2019 \nand 3.2% in 2020, still the lowest in developing Asia. Inflation eased slightly \nto 4.0% in 2018 as slower price rises in Papua New Guinea and Tonga, the \neconomies with the highest inflation, outweighed significant increases reflecting \nin large part higher fuel prices in several of the remaining economies, notably \nTimor-Leste and Fiji, the second largest economy in the subregion. Inflation \nis expected to slow to 3.7% in 2019 and then bounce back to 4.0% in 2020, \nprimarily reflecting movements in international fuel and food prices.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xvii\nStrengthening disaster resilience\nSummary\n\uf076  Disaster risk and costs are rising, and Asia is particularly vulnerable.\n\uf074  Rapid socioeconomic development is converging with worsening threats \nfrom natural hazards to pose unprecedented risk from catastrophes in \ndeveloping Asia. \n\uf074  While the direct, immediate impacts of disasters tend to be local and short \nterm, new evidence presented in this report shows how these effects can \nspill over to other places and last for a lifetime.\n\uf074  Suitable policy interventions are required to keep disaster losses from \nspiraling into the future and across the region.\n\uf076  Disaster risk management has improved, but gaps remain.\n\uf074  Governments should continue to integrate disaster risk reduction \ninto broader development policies and public investment strategies. \nThey\u00a0can\u00a0build resilience from the ground up by facilitating climate \nchange adaptation through enhanced disaster-resilient infrastructure, \nsupporting the development of market mechanisms, and investing directly \nin communities. \n\uf074  Asia has led progress on these fronts in recent years, but positive trends \nneed reinforcement. Spending on disaster prevention continues to lag far \nbehind disaster response. Access to credit, insurance, and remittances \nremains sparse and uneven, limiting the coping strategies available to \nhouseholds affected by disasters. Immediate humanitarian response \ncould be better coordinated with subsequent interventions for long-term \nrecovery.\n\uf076  Managing disaster risk can enhance equity, resilience, and sustainability. \nA greater focus on strengthening disaster resilience and preparing for \nrecovery can ensure that rebuilding in the wake of disasters\u2014building back \nbetter\u2014emphasizes safety, timeliness, social equity, and the full realization of \neconomic potential.\nNatural hazards putting Asia\u2019s prosperity at risk\n(cid:31) Disasters are worse when vulnerable populations are exposed to hazards.\nThe upshot is harm to people and their physical assets such as property and \ninfrastructure. Hazards can be natural, like hurricanes and earthquakes, or \nman-made, like industrial accidents and nuclear meltdowns. This report focuses \non disasters that emerge from natural hazards, including severe weather events, \ngeophysical disturbances, and epidemics. They can occur suddenly with little \nor no warning, or they can build slowly over the span of days, weeks, months, \nor\u00a0years.", "xviii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n(cid:31) Development and climate change alter disaster risk. On the one hand, rising \nincomes enable communities to cope with disasters. On the other, rapidly \nexpanding coastal megacities, for example, create greater exposure to natural \nhazards. As the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events worsen \nbecause of climate change and associated sea level rise, coastal areas and island \nstates across Asia face increasingly dire threats. \n(cid:31)  More than four in five people affected by natural hazards live in Asia. \nFrom\u00a02000 to 2018, developing Asia was home to 84% of the 206 million \npeople affected by disasters globally on average each year. With nearly 38,000 \ndisaster fatalities annually in that period, the region accounted for almost 55% \nof 60,000 disaster fatalities worldwide, and it suffered 26% of the $128 billion \nin economic damage. In Asia, 82% of disasters ensued from extreme weather \nevents such as floods, storms, and droughts.\n(cid:31)  Those who suffer most are poor, marginalized, and isolated. Surveys after \nsevere flooding in Indian cities found that poor and migrant families were the \nworst affected, with some losing more than they earned in a year. Many small \nbusinesses fell into financial distress, some having to sell their assets and close \ndown. Further, surveys of communities heavily exposed to flooding across five \nAsian countries found that, among rural households surveyed, 90% had suffered \nin the past decade either loss of life or significant damage to assets from floods, \nand their financial recovery took more than three times longer than for urban \nhouseholds. Pacific island economies are especially vulnerable to severe hazards, \nreflecting their isolation, limited economic diversification, and extreme exposure.\nDisaster impacts and how they propagate\n(cid:31) Immediate impacts on local economic activity can be substantial. New \nevidence on the economic impacts of tropical storms in the Philippines shows \nthat each of these events reduced local economic activity in that year by 1.7% \non average but by as much as 23% after the most severe storms. More extreme \nevents can have much larger impacts. Cyclone Pam in 2015\u2014the second most \nintense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the South Pacific\u2014caused damage \nin Vanuatu equal to 64% of annual GDP. Events that fall short of catastrophic \ntypically affect economic activity for a year or less, allowing households that \ntemporarily migrate away in the aftermath of a disaster to return to their land \nand livelihoods.\n(cid:31)  Beyond immediate loss of life and wealth, effects can persist over time. \nMore than a decade after the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan, for example, \nincome per capita in Hyogo Prefecture was 12% lower than it otherwise would \nhave been. Case studies of flooding in Indian cities show that, in the absence \nof social protection, disaster-hit families deplete their savings or borrow at \nhigh interest rates from informal sources, pushing them into indebtedness \nand poverty traps. Recent research reveals that disasters can affect victims for \ndecades as reduced household spending on food, medicine, and education, \nfor\u00a0example, stunts a child\u2019s potential well into adulthood. ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xix\n(cid:31) Effects can spread and link up with epidemics, conflict, and other risks.\nDisruption to supply chains, as occurred in 2011 after floods in Thailand and \nthe Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, can transmit disaster impacts to \nfirms and customers not directly hit by the event. Spatial transmission of impacts \nhappens as well when people are forced to leave a stricken area, creating a \ndisplaced population. East, Southeast, and South Asia accounted for over 60% \nof the estimated 19 million people displaced by disasters in 2017\u2014some briefly, \nothers for much longer. The number of internal climate migrants is projected to \nincrease rapidly. Disaster-induced migration can expose migrants to flooding, \nlandslides, heat stress, and other hazards. It may also facilitate the spread of \ndisease and even spark social disorder in urban areas, as suggested by new \nevidence on flood-induced migration.\nInvesting in development with disaster resilience\n(cid:31) Asia has achieved substantial mainstreaming of disaster risk management. \nMany countries in the region are adapting the Sendai Framework for Disaster \nRisk Reduction, 2015\u20132030 for national needs and thereby effecting a notable \npolicy shift in disaster response from reactive to proactive. Escalating losses from \ndisasters suggest that these positive trends require reinforcement to translate \nplans into actions and to address the causes of social vulnerability and the \ndrivers of disaster risk.\n(cid:31)  Greenfield investment is a natural entry point for disaster resilience. \nDeveloping Asia is estimated to need $26 trillion in infrastructure \ninvestment\u00a0from 2016 to 2030, or $1.7 trillion per year. Planning for and \ninvesting in climate-friendly and disaster-resilient infrastructure from the start \ncan help avoid locking\u00a0in further exposure to disaster risk and is a particularly \ncost-effective way to reduce future losses from disasters. \n(cid:31)  Spending on prevention needs to catch up with spending on response. \nGlobally, governments in developing countries receive seven times more \nassistance for responding to disasters after they occur than for preparing \nin advance for rapid recovery and, where possible, taking measures to \nkeep hazards from developing into disasters. In Asia, this spending gap has \nnarrowed slightly over the past few years but remains large. Further closing \nthe gap will yield multiple dividends, especially when investments have \ndevelopment benefits aside from reducing disaster risk. Examples include \nstable water resource management that integrates flood risk considerations, \nthe construction of cyclone-safe multipurpose evacuation centers that serve \ndaily as classrooms or community centers, the reestablishment of sustainable \nmangrove forests to absorb storm impacts and prevent coastal erosion, or \nhydroponic projects that diversify incomes in normal times and safeguard food \nsecurity when disaster strikes.\n(cid:31)  Risk shared through commercial credit or insurance is manageable risk. \nAcross Asia including Japan, just over 8% of catastrophe losses since 1980 were \ncovered by insurance. Recent years have seen an increase in programs that offer \ninsurance coverage, especially across developing Asia. New studies show that ", "xx(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\ntwo-thirds of them offer micro-insurance to cover agriculture losses, and over \n80% depend on subsidies or other financial support. The benefits of insurance \nare clear: pooling risk to preserve human welfare, facilitating investment \nby containing risk, and making post-disaster support more predictable. \nWhile\u00a0traditional indemnity insurance models are difficult to scale down to the \nneeds of individual households in poor communities, more innovative insurance \nmodels such as index-based risk-transfer products (such as drought insurance \nlinked to rainfall) offer potential, and government and international support for \nreinsurance allows broader pooling of risk. \n(cid:31)  Hiring victims can help, as can informal support networks and remittances. \nLabor market interventions can gainfully employ some disaster-affected people \nin reconstruction after disasters. Informal risk-sharing arrangements such as \nthrough private transfers within communities can effectively cope with shocks \nto individual households but not with shocks to whole communities from \nlarge disasters. Public transfers can help, as can remittances from outside the \naffected\u00a0area. In the Philippines, for example, remittances compensated for \nnearly 65% of income lost in shocks caused by rainfall deviation. The poorest of \nthe poor, however, often lack the social and financial networks necessary to allow \nfamily members to migrate and remit.\n(cid:31)  Community action must complement national efforts. Communities are \nthemselves the first responders to disasters, often with little or no immediate \nexternal support, and are key to ensuring sustained recovery and reconstruction. \nNew evidence from flood resilience surveys across 88 communities in Asia \nshows that community investments can build resilience while delivering \nbroader development benefits, such as better education, transportation, and \nfood supply. Proper waste management, for example, can prevent the spread \nof disease and keep rivers and drains clear to carry away floodwaters, while \nbenefiting communities more broadly day to day. Recent experience after major \nearthquakes and tropical cyclones in Asia highlights the role of local communities \nas custodians of local knowledge and experience that enables the dissemination \nof early warning messages and timely evacuation, and that can guide the \neffective delivery of humanitarian response and recovery assistance.\n(cid:31)  Development agencies support disaster resilience in many ways. Countries \nhave received concessional loans and grants from development agencies to \nstrengthen disaster resilience. Multilateral and regional lenders support the \nestablishment of disaster-contingent financing arrangements designed for \nquick disbursement. An ADB $6 million contingent financing loan to Tonga, \nfor\u00a0example, was fully disbursed in just 3 days after that Pacific island country \nwas struck by Tropical Cyclone Gita in February 2018. Other multilateral \nassistance from ADB has designed and piloted innovative insurance programs, \nnotably a disaster insurance pool for city governments in the Philippines that \nwas a world first. Meanwhile, international efforts continue to provide to poor \ncountries access to finance through more traditional emergency assistance loans \nand grants offered in response to disasters.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xxi\n(cid:31) Enhanced financial arrangements enable better disaster management.\nDelayed or insufficient financing for relief, early recovery, or reconstruction \nexacerbates the economic and social consequences of direct physical damage, \nextending the time required to rebuild infrastructure, render it fully functional, \nand deliver the services that depend on it. Such shortcomings stymie efforts \nto build back better. Governments increasingly recognize this and work to \nenhance both sovereign and nonsovereign financing instruments with support \nfrom development partners. The Government of the Philippines became the \nfirst to position these instruments in a wider framework by establishing in 2015 \na national financing strategy for disaster risk to promote a comprehensive \napproach. The Government of Indonesia launched a similar strategy in 2018, and \nsuch strategies are currently under development in Myanmar and Pakistan. \nPrepared to build back better after a disaster\n(cid:31) Humanitarian response is a prelude to recovery and reconstruction.\nSustainable recovery must overcome operational challenges and bridge the \ngap between urgent humanitarian response and longer-term recovery and \nreconstruction. The efficient and equitable allocation of private and public \nresources in response to disasters is often challenged by deficiencies in \ngovernance. Even after finances are secured, reconstruction projects face local \nimplementation challenges such as a lack of skilled personnel, unclear land \ntenure, transportation bottlenecks, and sudden increases in wage rates and \nprices for construction materials. Case studies of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal \nand Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu the same year indicate that successful long-term \nrecovery requires broad collaboration involving central and local governments, \ncivil society, and affected communities. The roles and responsibilities of all \nstakeholders must be clear, and responsible parties must have the experiential \nknowledge and capacity necessary to absorb and effectively apply the large \ninfluxes of resources that materialize after disasters.\n(cid:31)  Build back better to equitably realize social and economic potential. \nBuilding back better means ensuring that recovery is not only complete but \nsuperior to the status quo before the disaster. While building back fast often \ntakes precedence in the immediate aftermath, it must be balanced against other \nobjectives. Strengthening resilience under future hazards should be central to \nrecovery and reconstruction. Crucially, this entails integrating measures that \nmitigate disaster risk when restoring infrastructure and social capital, as well as \nensuring that reconstruction restores and renews economic opportunity and \ndynamism. Finally, public planning for recovery and building back better must be \ninclusive and fair to vulnerable segments of society.", "xxii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nGDP growth rate and inflation, % per year\nGDP growth Inflation\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2017 2018 2019 2020\nCentral Asia 4.2 4.4 4.2 4.2 9.0 7.9 7.8 7.2\nArmenia 7.5 5.2 4.3 4.5 1.0 2.5 3.5 3.2\nAzerbaijan 0.1 1.4 2.5 2.7 12.9 2.3 4.0 5.0\nGeorgia 4.8 4.8 5.0 4.9 6.0 2.6 3.2 3.0\nKazakhstan 4.1 4.1 3.5 3.3 7.4 6.0 6.0 5.5\nKyrgyz Republic 4.7 3.5 4.0 4.4 3.2 1.5 3.0 3.5\nTajikistan 7.1 7.3 7.0 6.5 6.7 5.4 7.5 7.0\nTurkmenistan 6.5 6.2 6.0 5.8 8.0 9.4 9.0 8.2\nUzbekistan 4.5 5.1 5.2 5.5 13.7 17.9 16.0 14.0\nEast Asia 6.2 6.0 5.7 5.5 1.6 2.0 1.8 1.8\nHong Kong, China 3.8 3.0 2.5 2.5 1.5 2.4 2.3 2.3\nMongolia 5.3 6.9 6.7 6.3 4.3 6.8 8.5 7.5\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China 6.8 6.6 6.3 6.1 1.6 2.1 1.9 1.8\nRepublic of Korea 3.1 2.7 2.5 2.5 1.9 1.5 1.4 1.4\nTaipei,China 3.1 2.6 2.2 2.0 0.6 1.3 1.1 1.2\nSouth Asia 6.9 6.7 6.8 6.9 3.9 3.7 4.7 4.9\nAfghanistan 2.7 2.2 2.5 3.0 5.0 0.6 3.0 4.5\nBangladesh 7.3 7.9 8.0 8.0 5.4 5.8 5.5 5.8\nBhutan 6.3 5.5 5.7 6.0 4.3 3.6 3.8 4.0\nIndia 7.2 7.0 7.2 7.3 3.6 3.5 4.3 4.6\nMaldives 6.9 7.6 6.5 6.3 2.8 \u20130.1 1.0 1.5\nNepal 7.9 6.3 6.2 6.3 4.5 4.2 4.4 5.1\nPakistan 5.4 5.2 3.9 3.6 4.2 3.9 7.5 7.0\nSri Lanka 3.4 3.2 3.6 3.8 7.7 2.1 3.5 4.0\nSoutheast Asia 5.3 5.1 4.9 5.0 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.7\nBrunei Darussalam 1.3 \u20131.0 1.0 1.5 \u20130.2 0.1 0.2 0.2\nCambodia 7.0 7.3 7.0 6.8 2.9 2.5 2.5 2.5\nIndonesia 5.1 5.2 5.2 5.3 3.8 3.2 3.2 3.3\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

However, heterogeneity in country \nestimates presented in Box\u00a01.2.2 suggests that applying a \none-size-fits-all approach for policy prescriptions may not be \nappropriate, calling instead for country-specific action.\nWhat can the region do?\nDespite heterogeneity by country, there are still some \ngeneral approaches to policy that can be adopted to limit \nthe influence of adverse external conditions on domestic \nfinancial systems. Ensuring domestic financial stability is a \nchallenge, especially when external funding conditions are \nclouded with uncertainty. Experience from past crises like \nthe Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 and the global financial \ncrisis of 2008\u20132009 repeatedly highlights the importance of \nstrengthening domestic financial resilience to mitigate negative \nspillover from changes in global funding conditions. \nThe analysis here points to the role of smoothing \nexchange rate fluctuations to reduce uncertainty regarding \ndomestic financial conditions. To this end, both monetary and \nmacroprudential policies need to take into consideration the \neffects exchange rate movements have on domestic financial \nconditions through both the financial channel and the trade \nchannel. As such, domestic policies should be coordinated to \nensure that they are effective, avoiding potential conflict and \nundesirable outcomes.\nMore broadly, further developing and deepening capital \nmarkets in the region can provide a better environment \nfor maintaining healthy domestic financial conditions. \nExpanding\u00a0the investor base at home and further developing \nlocal currency bond markets can dampen unwanted effects \nfrom the global financial environment. \nTo promote better domestic financial resilience and \ndampen the impact of external funding conditions on domestic \nfinancial markets, all these policies should go together with \nstrengthened policy dialogue across borders to monitor \nmacrofinancial conditions, identify systemic risks, and improve \nregional financing arrangements.

As such, comprehensively understanding the impact of \ndisasters requires understanding their complexity.\nThe context in which disasters occur tends to be highly \ndynamic.

They\u00a0may be \ninfluenced by market mechanisms that operate through insurance \nor supply chains; government action in the form of infrastructure \ninvestment, early warning systems, and recovery assistance; \nand the actions of individuals as they relocate and migrate; \nor of communities as they reinforce social networks and build \nsocial\u00a0capital. \nLooking on the bright side in the aftermath of a disaster, \nthe\u00a0recovery phase is often a window of opportunity to learn \nfrom experience, mitigate future vulnerability and exposure, and \nenhance resilience.

However, the differing composition of damage to assets, \nand of fatalities and the number of people affected, associated with \ndifferent disaster types may be attributable as well to differing \nfrequency and predictability. \nWeather-related hazards are fairly predictable, facilitating \npreparation and effective early warning. Riverine floods, for \nexample the 2011 flood in Thailand, can be predicted well in \nadvance, sometimes by more than a month, and landfall for a \ntropical cyclone is usually known days before it happens. In these \ncases, lives can be saved by evacuating people out of harm\u2019s way \nand using specially constructed shelters. The\u00a0construction of \ncyclone shelters and the introduction of early warning systems in \nBangladesh, for example, has dramatically reduced the number of \ncasualties in these events (Haque et al. 2012). In principle, deaths \nin weather-related hazards should be almost fully preventable. \nThose\u00a0that\u00a0occur\u00a0are appropriately perceived as revealing a policy \nfailure, especially as the costs of prevention are not prohibitive. \nIn\u00a0many cases, early warning systems have the added benefit of \nreducing asset damage by enabling people to defend some assets or \nmove them out of harm\u2019s way.\nDisasters triggered by geophysical hazards are relatively rare, \nso populations and governments may tend to underappreciate \nthem and underprepare for them. Volcanic eruptions are becoming \nincreasingly predictable, albeit only by several days but enough to \nallow the authorities to issue evacuation orders before they occur. \nEarthquakes, by contrast, are essentially unpredictable, even as \nthe general seismic risk profiles of particular geographical regions \nbecome known. As such, mortality and damage from earthquakes \nis largely preventable only to the extent that construction \nstandards are made robust enough for buildings and other \ninfrastructure to withstand ground movement. This is a costly and \nchallenging\u00a0undertaking.\nEarly warning systems for tsunamis are feasible, but how much \nin advance warnings can be sounded depends on the distance of \nthreatened areas from the epicenter of the geophysical event that \ngenerated the tsunami. More generally, warnings are conditional \non scientists\u2019 limited ability to predict tsunamis precisely. \nThe\u00a0three deadly disasters in Indonesia in\u00a02018\u00a0(Box\u00a02.1.2) hit \nthe coast without any advance warning despite the introduction, \nafter the catastrophic 2004 tsunami in Aceh, of an early \nwarning system in the Indian Ocean. While technically more \nchallenging and more costly than early warning systems for \nweather events, tsunami alert systems date back to 1949, when the ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)65\nPacific\u00a0Tsunami\u00a0Warning Center was founded in Hawaii and \nbegan providing alerts throughout the Pacific\u00a0Ocean. \nEarly warning is best done through a collective approach. \nRegional neighbors establish and maintain an integrated \nwarning system as a regional public good that reduces cost \nwhile boosting efficacy.

A 50-year historical record, \nfor example, may very well not include an earthquake that \noccurs only once in 400 years. An alternative way of expressing \ndisaster impacts, rather than isolating losses from a particular \nevent or summing up the measured losses over a particular \nperiod, is through average annual losses (AALs). These are \ntotal expected losses annualized over a projected time frame \nof up to thousands of years. AALs are therefore the predicted \namount that countries would have to set aside each year to \ncover the cost of future disasters, assuming they received \nno international support. Another way to put it is that AALs \napproximate the actuarially fair annual cost of insuring against \nthese disasters. \nAs with other metrics for measuring disaster impacts, \nAALs expressed in absolute terms concentrate in larger \nand higher-income economies that are exposed to hazards. \nHowever, expressed as a percentage of exposed assets, they \nare significantly higher for smaller and low-income countries. \nAALs are estimated at around 0.8% of exposed assets for \nlow-income countries in developing Asia, compared with \n0.2% for those with lower-middle incomes, 0.1% for those \nwith upper-middle incomes, and 0.2% for high-income \ncountries.

More\u00a0than \n45% of global disaster mortality since 1990 has been \nconcentrated in just six events. However, the United Nations \nOffice for Disaster Risk Reduction has argued that mortality \nassociated with what is referred to as \u201cextensive disaster risk\u201d \nis almost unmeasured but also on the rise (UNISDR\u00a02013). \nEvents that pose extensive risk are not very dramatic or \nsevere but happen frequently: mainly flash floods, landslides, \nurban flooding, storms, and other localized weather events. \nElectrical\u00a0storms and lightning are notable for increasingly \ncausing losses from extensive risk, by sparking wildfires \n(UNISDR 2015).\nGlobal risk modeling rarely captures extensive risk. \nThe losses incurred from extensive risk are rarely reported \ninternationally but simply absorbed locally by low-income \nhouseholds, small businesses, and municipal governments \n(UNISDR 2009). Yet\u00a0deaths and economic losses from extensive \nrisks are mounting in low- and middle-income countries, \nas\u00a0measured on the database of the United Nations Office for \nDisaster Risk Reduction. In the past decade, losses to extensive \nrisk in 85 countries and territories came to $94\u00a0billion. \nExtensive disaster risk typically worsens inequality \nand poverty by slowly eroding development assets such\u00a0as \nhouses, schools, health facilities, roads, and other local \ninfrastructure (Gall, Borden, and Cutter 2009). As is intensive \nrisk, it is made worse by the usual adjuncts of inequality and \npoverty: weak governance, badly planned and managed urban \ndevelopment, and rural livelihoods made even more vulnerable \nby environmental degradation. As extensive risk rises, \nit\u00a0undermines efforts to reduce poverty and to achieve many \nof the Sustainable Development Goals, while the accumulating \nlosses associated with extensive disaster risk highlight that \nunderstanding and practicing disaster risk reduction has not \nbeen effective at avoiding risk generation and accumulation \n(UNISDR 2015).\nEvidence is mounting about the social and economic \ncosts of widespread, high-frequency natural hazards such \nas changing rainfall patterns and temperature fluctuations. \nThey\u00a0constrain human mobility (Barrios, Bertinelli, and \nStrobl\u00a02006; Henderson, Storeygard, and Deichmann 2014) and \nhuman capital accumulation (Maccini and Yang 2009, Hyland \nand Russ 2019), and can even cause conflict (see literature cited \nin Dell,\u00a0Jones, and Olken\u00a02014). ", "70(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nThese different types of disaster risk call for different \nresponse strategies that follow a \u201crisk layering\u201d approach. \nFor\u00a0example, financing response to disaster risk through \ninsurance may be the most viable mechanism for large residual \nrisks that cannot be reduced or managed otherwise. In the \ncase of extensive risk, the most effective responses may be \ninvestment in improved and disaster-resilient infrastructure, \neducation and social strengthening to build community \nresilience, and improved access for vulnerable groups to market \nmechanisms such as finance and remittances. Generally, \ndisaster risk reduction is the most effective first action to \ntackle disaster risk, both extensive and intensive. These are \ncentral themes in the remainder of this chapter. \nEscalating risk of disaster losses\nAcross developing Asia, losses from disasters are substantial \nand continue to impede development. They would seem to \nindicate that rising incomes and efforts toward adaptation \nand disaster risk reduction have been insufficient to balance \nthe worsening of hazards and greater community exposure \nto\u00a0them. \nExposure to disaster risk in developing Asia is rising \nrapidly. This is partly just a function of population and \neconomic growth, as there are more people and built \nstructures in harm\u2019s way, but it is also a function of trends \nthat concentrate population and assets in high-risk locations, \nsuch\u00a0as the spread of coastal megacities. Some of these trends \nare particularly pronounced in developing Asia. \nThe most striking recent illustration of such trends and \ntheir consequences was flooding in the second half of 2011 \nthat hit Thailand, specifically Greater Bangkok. According to \nEM-DAT, this was the costliest flood ever recorded globally. \nWorld Bank (2012) estimated that there were 800 fatalities \nand $46.5 billion in losses. The direct loss of property and \ninfrastructure to the flood was estimated to equal nearly \n13% of the annual GDP of Thailand. The flood affected many \nprovinces, including commercial and industrial districts \noutside of Bangkok. It started with very heavy rains in late \nJuly and early August. Flooding started in the north of the \ncountry, causing the south-flowing Chao Phraya, the main \nriver bisecting Greater Bangkok, to overflow its banks. \nMost\u00a0of the flood impact was experienced in the last quarter \nof 2011, with the high water bulge reaching Greater Bangkok \nin early November. While the wet monsoon of 2011 was \nindeed exceptional, a lot of the damage was traceable to the \nrecent construction of many industrial estates in flood-prone \nareas on the edges of Bangkok and the consequent lack of \nflood-water retention areas (known in Thai as kaem ling or \nmonkey\u2019s\u00a0cheeks).", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)71\nIn addition to rising exposure, worsening disaster risk \ncan be traced to the effects of climate change and the rise in \nsea level that is threatening coastal cities and island states \nacross Asia and the Pacific. Many coastal cities in the region \nare experiencing increased flood risk from other causes \nas well, notably from land subsidence, in part a result of \nuncontrolled\u00a0water abstraction; upriver deforestation, which \nreduces the capacity of the soil to hold water; and the paving of \nonce-permeable surfaces in urban areas.\nMany studies project large increases in economic damage \nfrom disasters in the near future. Some studies project annual \nglobal damage from floods to increase ninefold from $6 billion \nin 2005 to $52 billion by 2050, this increase arising from \nprojected socioeconomic change alone (Hallegatte et al. 2013). \nRecent research into the effects of future sea-level rise on \ncoastal cities highlights the potential economic and population \nlosses for global megacities. One dramatic prediction for \nHo\u00a0Chi Minh City is that it will lose 41% of its area, 22% of its \npopulation, and 22% of its real gross regional product (Desmet, \nNagy, and Rossi-Hansberg 2018). Other metropolitan areas that \nstand to lose an important share of their population include \nBangkok, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Similarly, studies of future \ndamage to coastal cities around the world from storm surges \npredict very large losses in absolute terms, concentrated in \nlarge Asian megacities. Many Asian cities risk losses equal to \n2% or more of their GDP from events that threaten each city \nwith a 5% probability of occurring by 2030 (Abadie, Galarraga, \nand de Murieta 2017). \nProjections of future global losses from tropical storms \nindicate large increases in economic damage caused\u00a0mainly \nby increased exposure arising from socioeconomic \ntrends. In\u00a0some\u00a0cases, higher intensity comes from higher \ntemperatures in the ocean. Economic damage from tropical \ncyclones in countries that are not wealthy members of the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD) is forecast to be doubled or trebled by 2100 by \nsocioeconomic change alone, soaring from the current \n$6.7\u00a0billion per year to $13\u00a0billion\u2013$18\u00a0billion by 2100. \nThe\u00a0projected increase reflects the estimated historical \npositive elasticity of cyclone damage with respect to incomes \n(Bakkensen and Mendelsohn 2019).\nFactoring in the effects of climate change increases the \nprojection for cyclone damage in non-OECD countries by a \nfurther 8% on average. By contrast, fatalities from cyclones \nare projected to decline by as much as three-quarters \nwith socioeconomic change, dropping from 8,000 per year \ncurrently in non-OECD countries to just over 2,000 per year \nby 2100. The\u00a0decline reflects the estimated historical trend \ntoward fewer cyclone fatalities with rising income, as well as \nsignificant improvements in early warning systems. ", "72(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nDisaster impacts and \nhow\u00a0they propagate\nLocal eff ects\nSome large, geographically widespread disasters are particularly \nmemorable. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan swept from the Federated \nStates of Micronesia through Palau, the Philippines, Viet Nam, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, and Taipei,China. More often, \nthough, disasters ar e localized events with economic impacts \nlargely concentrated in the affected area. Studies that rely on \nregional or national indicators to estimate the economic impacts \nof disasters are therefore often prone to underestimate the true \nlocal impact in the localities hardest hit.\nThe immediate impacts of disasters on local economic \nactivity can be significant. New analysis of the local economic \nimpacts of tropical cyclones in the Philippines showed that the \nlocal effects of these storms could be substantial\u00a0(Box\u00a02.2.1). \n2.2.1\u2002The local economic impacts of tropical cyclones in the Philippines\nMuch of the existing literature on the impact  1\u2002Night light intensity in the Philippines in 2013\nof tropical cyclones has tended to focus on \nnational or regional effects. While insightful, \nthese macroeconomic studies provide little useful \ninformation for formulating policies to build resilience \nlocally. More specifically, tropical cyclones are, like \nmost natural hazards, inherently local in nature, but \nlocal impact becomes diluted if averaged out over a \nlarge regional unit of analysis. A number of recent \npapers investigated this aggregation problem when \nmeasuring the impact of tropical storms and found \nthat aggregate data tended to underestimate the \ntrue impact of these extreme weather phenomena \non local\u00a0economies (Strobl 2011, Elliott, Strobl, and \nSun\u00a02015).\nStrobl (forthcoming) used nightlight intensity \nderived from satellite images, illustrated in \nbox\u00a0figure\u00a01, as a proxy for economic activity \n(Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil 2012) and combined \nit with actual storm tracks and a wind field model to \ninvestigate the local economic impact of typhoons in \nthe Philippines. The Philippines is one of the most \nstorm-prone countries of the world, with an average of \n7.5 typhoons having made landfall annually since 1970 \n(Blanc and Strobl 2016). \nResults from this analysis show that exposure \nto tropical cyclones significantly disrupts economic \nactivity in the Philippines.

The\u00a0cumulative \nimpact of these events in the Philippines since\u00a01992 is estimated \nto\u00a0have exceeded $11.6\u00a0billion.\nThese findings on the Philippines correspond to other recent \nevidence on the local economic impacts of flooding, which found \nthat large floods in urban areas reduced local GDP by 2%\u20138% \nin the year of the event (Kocornik-Mina et\u00a0al. forthcoming). \nAs\u00a0is\u00a0observed with cyclones, GDP in affected cities appears to \nbe\u00a0fully restored in the year following the flood. \nIt is important to note that GDP, even when measured \nlocally, is itself an aggregation and may therefore obscure \nimpacts on particular groups or individuals. This is especially \nproblematic if the impact is not distributed evenly across \nvarious groups and affects specific groups more intensely. ", "74(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nFurther,\u00a0by\u00a0focusing\u00a0on\u00a0measures of economic activity, this \nanalysis omits any social, cultural, or environmental impacts \nthat do not materially affect the economy. \nThe relatively quick restoration of economic activity \nobserved in these studies may partly reflect that, in many \ncases, households that temporarily migrate away in the \naftermath of disasters subsequently return to their land and \nlivelihoods. Of course, this rapid restoration of population \nand economic activity to affected areas may or may not be \ninterpreted as a sign of disaster resilience. In particular, if \ndisasters tend to reoccur, hitting the same locations with high \nfrequency\u2014as for example with monsoonal flooding\u2014then \nrestoring activity to these vulnerable locations may simply put \npeople and economic assets back in harm\u2019s way. \nThese concerns are reinforced by the anticipated effects \nof climate change on the risk of extreme weather events. \nClimate change will increase natural hazard risk for particular \nlocations. An important part of adaptation to climate change, \nat least in the long run, may involve moving people away from \nlocations with worsening hazards, with consequent reductions \nin productivity (Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg 2015, Desmet, \nNagy, and Rossi-Hansberg 2018). \nThe evidence available to date indicates that such \nadjustment is likely to be slow because current and future \npatterns of spatial development tend to follow paths laid down \nby earlier development, and it is costly to deviate from them \n(Bleakly and Lin 2012, Michaels and Rauch 2018). Cities in \nparticular have been found to persist even in the aftermath \nof devastating shocks, including wartime devastation (Davis \nand Weinstein 2002, Miguel and Roland 2011) and large-scale \nflooding (Kocornik-Mina et al., forthcoming). \nPersistent effects of disasters\nEmpirical evidence of the effects of disasters on growth \nis strongest in relation to small island developing states, \nwhere major events can wipe out a large part of the economy \nand destroy critical infrastructure such as airports and \nharbors (Heger, Julca, and Paddison 2008, Lee, Zhang, and \nNguyen\u00a02018, Dagli and Ferrarini, forthcoming). However, the \nbroader empirical literature on disasters and economic growth \nis far from conclusive. \nWhile most disaster impacts on economic activity appear to \nbe short-lived, in some cases the effects may persist for a long \ntime. (Recent empirical evidence on the short- and long-run \nimpacts of disasters in developing countries is reviewed in \nSawada and Takasaki [2017].) For example, a decade on from \nthe 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan, local income per capita \nin Hyogo Prefecture was still depressed by 12% because of \nlost\u00a0employment opportunities. This reflected a regional shift ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)75\nfrom manufacturing to services that was directly attributable \nto the earthquake. A significant share of heavily damaged \nfactories failed to resume operations in Kobe, and there was a \nshift in employment from Kobe to nearby Osaka. As\u00a0a\u00a0result, \nthe earthquake caused a permanent loss of economic \nopportunity (duPont et al. 2015, Cole et al. 2018).\nThere is also evidence that poor countries can experience \nprolonged, slow, and incomplete recovery in the aftermath \nof severe disasters. In particular, small island states are the \nmost vulnerable because of their diminutive size relative \nto the hazards\u2019 footprint, their geographic isolation, and \ntheir lack of economic diversity. These factors mean not \nonly higher aggregate damage but less hope of recovery in \nthe short or long\u00a0term (ADB 2018c). The 2010 earthquake in \nHaiti, for example, was so catastrophic that it was found to \nhave undermined the long-term development prospects of the \nHaitian economy (Best\u00a0and Burke 2017). \nMacro impacts through market prices \nDisaster effects can spread across time because of permanent \nshifts in market forces. They can, for example, cause lasting \ndistortions through market concentration and collusive price \nhikes. Recent research on the impact of the 2011 Thailand flood \non the hard disk drive industry, for instance, suggests that the \ndisaster enticed market-distorting collusion in certain segments \nof the industry (Box 2.2.2). \nDisasters may affect\u00a0location choices for households and \nbusinesses, thus influencing real estate prices. In efficient real \nestate markets, prices provide market signals about property \nvalue and its many determinants.\u00a0However, there\u00a0is substantial \nevidence that real estate\u00a0markets are far from efficient in \nreflecting disaster risk\u00a0in their prices. A\u00a0large number of \nempirical investigations in several countries demonstrated how \npast\u00a0experience of\u00a0floods\u00a0and flood risk affected house prices \nrelatively little and not for long. Meta-analysis established \nprice effects ranging from \u20137% to +1% (Beltr\u00e1n, Maddison, and \nElliott\u00a02018).\nThe weak sensitivity of real estate markets to disaster risk \nhas been attributed to\u00a0their lack of liquidity,\u00a0which limits price \nmovements. This and other frictions in land and real estate \nmarkets kept commercial and residential land prices from \ndeclining despite substantial damage from the 2011 flood in \nThailand (Sawada et al.\u00a02018, Wong 2008).\nBy contrast, there is ample evidence that, where market \nfrictions are small, real estate rental and asset prices may \nreflect disaster risk well. Research on earthquake risk \naversion in the Tokyo metropolitan area, for example, found \nthat housing rents were substantially lower in risky areas \nthan in safer ones (Nakagawa, Saito, and Yamaga\u00a02007).

Land prices in unflooded areas increased relative \nto those in flooded areas, but this was driven mainly by \nnew entrants choosing less risky locations. While industrial \nland prices were affected, there was no evidence of effects \nfrom flooding on residential or commercial land values. ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)77\nOther\u00a0studies found similar\u00a0short-term\u00a0moderate price declines \nfor\u00a0houses\u00a0that were associated with earthquake risk (Hidano, \nHoshino, and Sugiura 2015, Timar, Grimes, and Fabling 2018a).\nReal estate markets may fail to reflect disaster risk\u00a0for a \nnumber of reasons. One is incomplete information on\u00a0existing\u00a0risk, \nas suggested by studies showing sharpened risk perceptions \nfollowing extreme events. For example, Gallagher\u00a0(2014) found \nthat insurance take-up in the US spiked the year after heavy \nfloods and steadily declined thereafter. Another is the moral \nhazard associated with government interventions to provide \nprotective infrastructure and disaster recovery. A typical trade-off \ninvolves public money spent to reduce risk to people living in \nflood-prone areas, which makes them more reluctant to relocate \naway from risky areas (Kocornik-Mina et al., forthcoming).\nIt is notable that, despite limited liquidity and other frictions \nin the real estate market, once the government intervenes to \nclearly define\u00a0and constrain\u00a0the risk, the impact on real estate \nprices can be significant. For example, prices for buildings \nin Wellington, New Zealand, fell by an average of 45% after \nthey were officially declared earthquake-prone and in need of \nremediation to meet earthquake safety standards (Timar, Grimes, \nand Fabling 2018b).\nMacro impacts through small businesses\nDisasters can disrupt businesses by, for example, increasing \ncosts for their inputs. Smaller firms in particular will struggle \nto cope with direct damage to their buildings, equipment, and \ninventory and with other interruptions to their operations. \nIn\u00a0the aftermath of flooding in Mumbai in 2005, for example, a \nsurvey was carried\u00a0out on a randomly selected group of 627 retail \noutlets in six flood-prone wards. Only 2% of surveyed businesses \nfiled insurance claims for flood-related losses, and the average \ncompensation received by those that did was only about \u20b935,000. \nInsurance claims compensated for no more than one-third of the \nlosses on average, and only for the small minority of businesses \nthat filed insurance claims (Patankar, forthcoming).\nFurther evidence from surveys and interviews with flood-\naffected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in \nChennai found that the businesses worst affected were those \nwith annual turnover of less than \u20b9100 million (Idicheria \nand Neelakantan\u00a02016). Most of the losses incurred by \nthese businesses were damage to fixed assets like physical \ninfrastructure, with manufacturers the worst affected. \nMany lost\u00a0as well important business documents, including \nelectronically stored documents along with the electronic \nequipment. Business services were disrupted by flood damage \nto infrastructure. On average, firms made do without electricity \nfor 13 days and without water supply for 12 days. Solid waste and \nsewage issues persisted for more than 15 days. ", "78(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nThe flood exposed how very much smaller businesses rely \non informal financing channels like friends and unlicensed \nmoneylenders. Most smaller businesses had invested their \nown money or borrowed from private sources to set up their \nenterprises. They typically had slim profit margins and limited \ncredit. Losses to the flood were amplified for such businesses \nby their lack of access to emergency funds or additional finance \nthrough official lending institutions. Although some had \ninsurance, the payouts were very low and in some cases were not \npaid for months. With production shut down, perhaps for lack \nof inputs and clients, many firms suffered significant financial \ndistress. Many could not repay their loans and were forced to \nshut down and sell their assets (Patankar, forthcoming).\nLow insurance penetration is a problem not only for firms \nin developing countries. Disaster insurance uptake by firms \nis low even in developed countries like Japan, where the \nparticipation rate for disaster insurance is only 47% for SMEs \n(Sawada\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02017). \n2.2.1\u2002F inancial recovery time from last severe flood\nMicro impacts on households and health\nRural 27 weeks\nThe direct effects of disasters disproportionately hit poorer \nhouseholds and the more vulnerable members of society, \nas is well recognized.

Considering drought, for example, rainfall in \nthe year and location of birth significantly correlated with \nadult outcomes for Indonesian women born in 1953\u20131974, with \nmore bountiful rainfall in infancy associated with better health \nand higher educational attainment and household wealth \nin adulthood (Maccini and Yang 2009). In the Philippines, \ntyphoons were linked to higher infant mortality for baby \ngirls up to 2 years after a typhoon (Hsiang and Anttila-\nHughes 2013). Hurricane risk appeared to have a significantly \nnegative impact on educational achievement in the Caribbean \n(Spencer, Polachek, and Strobl 2016). Among children who \nlost parents in Indonesia to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, \nthe older ones subsequently\u00a0completed fewer years of school, \neither because they had to assume parental responsibilities or \nbecause of trauma associated with the loss (Cas et al. 2014). \nYounger\u00a0children were less\u00a0affected. \nEven more troubling are findings from studies on the \npotential for intergenerational transmission of adverse disaster \nimpacts. Research showed that women who were exposed \nin utero to a catastrophic Peruvian earthquake in 1970 \nbore children decades later who suffered lower educational \nattainment than their peers whose mothers had not been \nsimilarly exposed (Caruso and Miller 2015). \nAnother recent study found that women in sub-Saharan \nAfrica who were exposed to drought in rural areas during their \nearly childhood received fewer years of formal education, were \nsignificantly less wealthy as adults, and, if the drought was \nextreme, grew to be shorter in stature (Hyland and Russ\u00a02019). \nMoreover, evidence in this study suggested again that effects \nmight be transmitted to the women\u2019s offspring, with the \nchildren of affected women more likely to be born with low \nbirth weight.\nAs can be seen from these examples from Peru and \nsub-Saharan Africa, the vulnerability of the poor is compounded \nby marginalization along various dimensions, including gender. \nExisting patterns of discrimination against women can be \nexacerbated by climate stress transmitted through income \nshocks (Miguel 2005, Sekhri and Storeygard\u00a02014).\nNatural hazards can stymie the formation of human capital \nthrough their effects on health. Extremes of both flooding and \ndrought have been associated with higher incidence of malaria \nand with outbreaks of other vector-borne diseases such as \nplague, Lyme disease, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, \nas well as outbreaks of various waterborne diseases including \ncholera, typhoid, and other diarrheal diseases (Hales, Edwards, \nand Kovats 2003). ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)81\nEpidemics in particular arise from complex interaction \nbetween physical, ecological, and social mechanisms. \nThe\u00a0trigger can be an extreme weather event that leaves in its \nwake deficient or contaminated water supplies, malnutrition \nbecause of disrupted food supply, human displacement, \nincreased pressure on local infrastructure and health care \nfacilities, or physical conditions favorable for pathogens and \ntheir carriers to breed. \nReported health impacts affecting households surveyed in \nthe aftermath of severe flooding in India included a notable \nrise in reported cases of diseases such as gastroenteritis and \nleptospirosis, as well as increased incidence of malaria, dengue, \nand typhoid. These impacts came immediately following the \nflood, measurably exceeding their already high prevalence \nduring a normal monsoon season (Patankar, forthcoming). \nThus, while disasters may usually appear to deliver \ntransient shocks at the macroeconomic scale, their effects at \nthe micro scale may persist over the long term, with potential \nto disrupt markets, push poorer households into debt and \npoverty, and diminish educational attainment, future earning \npotential, and long-term health outcomes.\nImpact on institutions, governance, and con\ufb02ict \nDisasters may similarly have indirect effects on longer-term \ndevelopment trajectories through their effects on institutions, \ngovernance, and conflict, though the evidence is difficult to \nestablish and suggests heterogenous effects (Castells-Quintana, \nLopez-Uribe, and McDermott 2017). In some cases, disasters \ncan actually improve institutions and governance by generating \ndissatisfaction with the status quo. \nThere is a growing literature on the relationship between \nweather shocks and conflict. It generally finds that weather \nshocks\u2014particularly droughts, extremely high temperatures, \nand deviation in rainfall patterns\u2014can make conflict more \nlikely and, when it occurs, more intense (Dell, Jones, and Olken \n2014). Most of the studies linking climate and conflict focus \non the effect of weather shocks on rural incomes. A drought, \nfor example, that removes jobs and hurts rural incomes may \nincrease the supply of willing combatants. \nIt has been suggested as well that disaster shocks can \ncreate windows of opportunity for democratic development \nas affected populations become more motivated to contest \npower (Burke and Leigh 2010, Br\u00fcckner and Ciccone 2011). \nSome historical accounts suggest that the Meiji Restoration in \nJapan, for example, was triggered by a series of devastating \nearthquakes in 1854\u20131855 (Clancey 2006). However, disaster \nshocks are also associated with a higher likelihood of irregular \nor extralegal leadership transitions, including military coups, \nsetting back democratic development and economic growth ", "82(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n(Dell, Jones, and Olken 2012). The Islamic revolution in Iran, \nwhich caused a dramatic decline in incomes, may have been \ntriggered by the devastating 1978 earthquake in the southern \ncity of Tabas (Cavallo et al. 2013).\nThe findings from the literature remain controversial \nbecause the determinants of conflict are highly complex, \nand the potential effects of weather shocks or disasters on \ninstitutions, for better or worse, appear to depend heavily on \nthe socioeconomic, political, and institutional characteristics \nof the affected country (Waldinger 2016, Castells-Quintana, \nLopez-Uribe, and McDermott 2017).\nPervasive effects of disasters\nDisaster effects can spread across wide geographic areas \nthrough, for example, damage to market mechanisms, \nsuch as disruption to supply chains, and the movements of \nemployers, employees, or affected populations more generally. \nWhen\u00a0disaster strikes and impacts propagate through \nproduction networks or supply chains, the shock is felt not only \nby companies in the affected region, but also by those outside it \nand sometimes very far away. This happened in the aftermath \nof the Tohoku earthquake in March 2011, for example, and \nthe Thailand flood later that year. Both events imposed severe \nshortages on firms in the US and Europe that used inputs \nfrom the affected regions in their production processes. \nThe\u00a0customers of the Japanese and Thai firms directly hit by \nthe disaster had to slow or even stop their own production for \nlack of parts and components. \nNegative spillover through supply chains \nRecent empirical literature has found strong evidence of these \nsupply-chain ripple effects, using data on firms in Japan and \nthe US and on multinational companies in global supply chains. \nFor example, research on idiosyncratic shocks from disasters \nto firms in the US since the mid-1980s found that affected \nsuppliers imposed heavy output losses on downstream users, \nespecially when they produced unique inputs (Barrot and \nSauvagnat 2016). This then translated into significant losses \nthat spilled over to other suppliers within production networks. \nSimilarly, studies on the upstream and downstream impacts \nof the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami on suppliers and \nconsumers found that the transmission of the shock through \ninput\u2013output linkages caused a 1.2% decline in Japan\u2019s gross \noutput in the year after the earthquake (Carvalho et al. 2016).\nSupply-chain interdependencies, especially if coupled with \ncost-effective just-in-time delivery of components, potentially \ncreate greater indirect exposure to natural hazards for \nfirms not directly exposed or even located in hazard zones. ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)83\nMoreover, the propagation of impacts can occur quickly and \nwidely in modern supply chain networks (Inoue and\u00a0Todo\u00a02018). \nBut\u00a0the\u00a0role of supply chains in either propagating or mitigating \nbusiness disruptions from disasters appears to depend on the \ncharacteristics of the supply chain. Specifically, the propagation \neffect is larger when inputs are more specific and cannot be \neasily substituted (Barrot and Sauvagnat 2016).\nSome research looking at international spillover found \nthat these supply chain effects were typically confined \nwithin the affected country. Several studies observed neither \ndownstream nor upstream propagation beyond national borders. \nFor\u00a0instance, using firm-level and supply-chain data on more \nthan 100,000 major firms around the world, Kashiwagi, Todo, \nand Matous\u00a0(2018) found the propagation effect on US firms to \nbe smaller for larger firms and for those linked into international \nsupply chains. International firms can find substitutes for \ndamaged suppliers and customers more easily than can firms \nwith purely domestic supply chains, which may explain why the \ninternational propagation of shocks is less\u00a0likely. \nOther studies, however, do find evidence that the interruption \nof supply chains can reverberate internationally. Philippine \nimports of automobiles and parts from Thailand, for example, \nwere observed to decline by more than 35% from January 2011 to \nNovember 2011, after floods disrupted supply chains in Thailand, \nthan in the same period in 2010, when there was no such \ndisruption (Haraguchi and Lall 2014). Sales\u00a0of\u00a0new\u00a0automobiles \nin the Philippines in the period consequently decreased by up to \n140,000 units, a 4.0% decline from the first 11 months of 2010.\nThe interconnected nature of supply chain networks \nhints at the potential for government responses to disasters\u2014\ntargeted, for example, at affected firms\u2014to prevent spillover \non unaffected firms and regions. Governments can leverage \nmarket mechanisms to minimize disruption to supply chains \nby facilitating and supporting the reconstruction of damaged \nproduction facilities, particularly those of smaller enterprises, \nand by fostering greater cooperation among firms and \nredundancies in their supply chains.\nA role for targeted subsidies? \nFirms have incentives to prepare business continuity plans \nand to cooperate with each other to find substitutes for \ndamaged suppliers after a major disaster, but room still \nexists to actively encourage and facilitate such cooperation. \nGovernment\u00a0intervention can mitigate the propagation of \ndisaster shocks by, for example, organizing emergency trade fairs \nto ease supply chain disruptions in both affected and unaffected \nareas. Similarly, governments may choose to subsidize damaged \nfirms\u2019 recovery of key capital goods if those firms are crucial \nnodes in production supply chains.", "84(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nOne prominent example of this was a policy intervention by \nwhich the Japanese authorities funded 75% of costs to repair \nor reinstall the damaged capital goods and facilities of groups \nof SMEs after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. For greater \nimpact, the subsidy was provided only to groups of firms linked \nthrough supply chains and located in the same industrial or \ncommercial area. Group subsidy disbursements started within \n6 months of the disaster. By 2018, \u00a5504\u00a0billion had been \ngranted through this program to 705 company groups. \nKashigawi and Todo (forthcoming) evaluated the impact \nof this subsidy and how it filtered through supply chains. \nThe study found that group subsidies particularly benefitted \nsmall recipient firms\u2014manufacturers with no more than 20 \nemployees or service providers with no more than 5 employees, \nin both cases counting employees after the disaster.

Nowadays, one in three migrants \ncomes from Asia, and the countries with the highest ratio of \noutward migrants are the hazard-exposed Pacific economies \n(ADB 2018d). Both international and internal rural\u2013urban \nmigration is often driven by economic pressures and the \nsearch for more opportunity. Every year, millions of people \naround the world are forced to leave their homes after \ndisasters render them unable to sustain themselves in their \nhomes. These\u00a0pressures are particularly pronounced in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia.\nIn 2017, more than 18.8 million people were displaced \ninternally (many only temporarily) by sudden-onset \ndisasters worldwide, with East and South Asia accounting ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)85\nfor 11.4\u00a0million, or over 60% of the total (Figure 2.2.3)  2.2.3\u2002 New internal displacement  \n(IDMC\u00a02018).

Migrants\u00a0often\u00a0remain closely \ntied to the home region, for example through remittances. \nPopulation movements in response to disasters similarly span \na spectrum from forced displacement to voluntary migration, \nand from temporary and local to permanent and long distance \n(Figure 2.2.4). For this reason, numbers can be contentious, \nbut it is clear that large numbers of people move in response to \ndisasters. Regardless of the precise numbers, it is who moves \nand on what terms that is more important in determining the \nconsequences of disaster-related movement. \n2.2.4\u2002 The spectrum of human mobility and immobility\nMOBILITY IMMOBILITY\nMigration Relocation Displacement Stay Trapped\nPeople choose People People People choose People\nto migrate permanently evacuate a to stay. cannot move.\npermanently relocate with devastated area\nto a distant government and may choose\nlocation, maybe assistance to to go back.\nabroad. what is hoped is a\nless risky area.\nSource: Adapted from Ober (forthcoming), originally from Rigaud et al. 2018.\nThe benefits of migration arise from its use as a mechanism \nto diversify and smooth household income. In the aggregate, \nmigration can raise average labor productivity\u2014and \nconsequently incomes\u2014when people move to locations where \nproductivity is higher than at home. This is typically so in \ncities, which are generally more productive than rural\u00a0areas. \nIn\u00a0this context, migration more generally has been shown \nto offer potentially large welfare gains to migrants and \ntheir families, as in Gr\u00f6ger and Zylberberg (2016), studying \nhouseholds hit by typhoons in Viet Nam.", "86(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nDisasters usually motivate internal, localized, and \nshort-term movement. During sudden-onset disasters, \npeople often make decisions quickly and under duress. \nThe\u00a0decisions\u00a0whether to move\u2014and who moves, how, when, \nand to where\u2014are determined by the exposure, vulnerability, \nand resilience of each household, as well as by the assets they \nown and can use to finance such decisions. Unfortunately, \nthe\u00a0people who end up displaced by disasters are often among \nthe most\u00a0disadvantaged.\nOn average, the poor are more likely to migrate than other \ngroups when hit by disaster. However, the poorest of the poor \nmay be unable to migrate because they lack the necessary \nsocial connections or the resources including credit necessary \nto finance such a move. They thus becoming trapped and even \nmore vulnerable to future disasters (Black et al. 2011). Droughts \nin rural Bangladesh, for example, mobilized many households \nthat were not directly affected, while the worst affected were \nless likely to migrate because their already meager financial \nresources had been further decimated (Gray and Mueller\u00a02012). \nThe most severe disasters tend to inhibit mobility, as the \ncapacity to move is reduced by the adverse shock to income, \ncredit, and wealth (Robalino, Jimenez, and Chacon 2015). \nOther factors may stifle the desire to migrate in response to \nadverse environmental pressures, such as the decision of people \nin Tuvalu to stay put and advocate change (Noy 2017).\nIn sum, migration can benefit resilience, and when \nmigration does not happen, the barriers to migration may \nfurther victimize those who are unable to move. Support \nfor greater voluntary mobility\u2014specifically to empower \nindividuals and households to move on their own terms\u2014thus \nconstitutes an important but largely neglected policy response \nto disaster\u00a0risk.\nRisk of unplanned migration and forced displacement \nDisasters often displace populations and destroy physical \ncapital including buildings and other infrastructure, \nheightening vulnerability to the next disaster and creating \nexposure to other risks. When disasters cause people to \nmigrate to urban areas, for example, they may face additional \nexposure to flooding, heat stress, and epidemics, particularly \nin marginal and suburban shantytowns where basic shelter, \ninfrastructure, and sanitation were lacking even before the \nmigrants arrived. \nGlobally, the observed increase in disaster-exposed \npopulations is being driven, at least in part, by high migration \nto areas at risk, particularly urban areas in flood-prone coastal \nzones. Moreover, evidence suggests that migrant families \nnewly arrived in urban areas are particularly vulnerable to \nhazards. When severe flooding hit the Indian city of Chennai, ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)87\nthe houses of poor and migrant families were damaged or \neven washed away, yet migrant families were denied shelter \nand compensation for lack of official documentation. Some of \nthe affected migrant families had resettled from other areas \nvulnerable to hazards (Box 2.2.3). This suggests a role for \ngovernment in planning and directing voluntary migration \ntoward areas with lower disaster risk, even if only by providing \ninformation to migrants on the relative risk at various locations \n(Waldinger 2016). \nDisasters that push migrants to urban areas can create \nadditional problems in the receiving localities if, for example, \ncongestion worsens or competition intensifies in labor \nmarkets or for basic amenities, potentially sparking social \ndisorder (Bhavnani and Lacina 2015, Castells-Quintana and \nMcDermott,\u00a0forthcoming). \nDisasters can have diverse impacts on social cohesion. \nEspecially where deep schisms already exist in a society, \ndisasters and migration pressures generated by them can \nperpetuate these schisms or exacerbate them (Aldrich 2010). \nSometimes, though, disasters can improve social relations. \nExamples of these dynamics are much more prevalent than of \nworsening schisms, the most notable example in recent times \nin Aceh, Indonesia. A peace accord between the Government of \nIndonesia and the Free Aceh Movement in 2005, after 30 years \nof conflict, came as a direct consequence of the destruction in \nAceh wrought by the tsunami of December 2004.\nThe importance of \nappropriate\u00a0policy\u00a0support \nPolicy support can make migration more inclusively available \nas a mechanism for coping with risk. It can minimize the \npotential for negative spillover caused by displacement. \nIn\u00a0particular, information on the potential costs and benefits \nof migration, and on job opportunities at destinations, can \nhelp individuals make more informed choices and improve the \noutcomes of migration (Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak\u00a02014, \nMunshi 2003). Lowering other barriers\u2014including credit \nconstraints and institutional issues related, for example, \nto land tenure security\u2014can help potential migrants make \nbetter decisions that are more likely to improve their welfare \n(Deininger and Jin 2006). \nPolicy intervention is required to mitigate any negative \nimpacts in both the sending and the receiving region. \nIn\u00a0urban areas, additional strains on urban labor markets \nand infrastructure can alarm local residents when a rapid \nincrease in population occurs, particularly if it is caused \nby a large number of migrants appearing suddenly, as can \nhappen, for example, when drought hits a nearby rural area.

Disaster risk cannot be eliminated entirely, though, \nand unavoidable disasters can place signi\ufb01cant budgetary pressure \non governments, businesses, and individual households. Mindful of \nthe social and economic costs imposed by the disasters discussed \nabove, this section turns to the roles that governments and their \ninternational partners can play in building disaster resilience. \nTackling the underlying drivers of disaster risk and \nvulnerability requires a shift in approach toward disaster risk \nmanagement strategies that emphasize preventative and systemic \ninvestments. Resilience is a useful concept in the \ufb01eld because it has \nthe potential to facilitate a shift in perspective and practice toward \nmore forward-looking, comprehensive, and integrated approaches.\nIn addition to a conceptual shift toward resilience, a parallel \nneed is to explore risk management options available for local \ncommunities and individuals. After all, it is within communities \nthat disaster impacts are felt most strongly and a lot of detailed \nknowledge resides. Therefore, community action to tackle growing \ndisaster risk and mitigate impacts can be very effective.\nMuch progress has been made on these fronts in recent \nyears, with developing Asia leading the way. Governments should \ncontinue to integrate disaster risk reduction (DRR) into broader \ndevelopment policies and public investment strategies. They\u00a0can \nseek to build resilience from the ground up by supporting the \ndevelopment of market mechanisms such as insurance and \ncredit facilities, by investing directly in communities, and by \nemphasizing climate-change adaptation and disaster resilience in \ninfrastructure\u00a0development.\nProgress in dealing with disaster risk\nAsia has made substantial progress in mainstreaming disaster risk \ninto development plans.

In practice this \nhas meant that donor institutions are embedding disaster and \nclimate risks into development projects and programs.\nExamples of investments with multiple dividends are \nbecoming more commonplace, and international development \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) have taken up this \nagenda. NGOs that participate in the Flood Resilience Alliance, \nfor example, have reported engaging in various community-led \nprojects across Asia that generate additional dividends in \naddition to reducing \ufb02ood risk. One example integrates into early \nwarning systems weather boards that improve preparedness for \nextreme weather but also generate more routine bene\ufb01ts from \nbetter weather forecasting, including improved crop-sowing \ndecisions. Other examples are water resource management that \nintegrates \ufb02ood risk considerations, the construction of disaster- \nresilient multipurpose evacuation and community centers, the \nreestablishment of mangrove forests against storms and coastal \nerosion, and hydroponics projects that stabilize incomes in \nnormal times and safeguard food security when disaster strikes.\nLittle detailed information is available about national \nprojects designed to have synergistic multiple dividends. \nThe\u00a0few\u00a0countries that release such information rarely take it \nbeyond the \ufb01rst risk reduction dividend. Donors and some NGOs \nhave reported synergistic spending on DRR integrated with \nclimate and development concerns, and countries should follow \nsuit. Some evidence on national spending can be evinced from a \nrecent review of national DRR expenditure in the Lao\u00a0People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet\u00a0Nam in the 4\u00a0years \nto 2014.

needs in developing Asia are estimated \nat $26 trillion from 2016 to 2030, or $1.7 trillion per year \nincluding necessary investments in climate-change mitigation \nand adaptation (ADB 2017, ADB 2019b). These\u00a0investments need \nto take into account disaster risk for two reasons. First,\u00a0some \nof the projects are themselves likely to be subject to disaster \nrisk, which affects their expected return on investment. ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)95\nSecond,\u00a0infrastructure investments can in\ufb02uence future exposure \nto disaster risk by, for\u00a0example, altering spatial development \npatterns, especially with the construction of new roads, ports, or \nother transport infrastructure (Dietz, Dixon, and Ward\u00a02016). \nThe large scale of anticipated investment needs underscores \nthe potential for these investments to in\ufb02uence future \nexposure and vulnerability to disaster risk in developing Asia. \nMany\u00a0infrastructure projects are irreversible to a greater or lesser \nextent. This is clearly the case with major physical infrastructure \nprojects designed for long use and bearing a large initial price \ntag, making them costly to reverse. But\u00a0it\u00a0may be true as well \nfor other investments that in\ufb02uence long-term development \npatterns by creating path dependencies. This\u00a0is often the case, \nfor example, with urban planning and development, making \nsuch investments\u00a0very expensive to undo (Dietz, Dixon, and \nWard\u00a02016, Kocornik-Mina et al., forthcoming). \nGreen\ufb01eld infrastructure investments are natural entry \npoints for including disaster resilience in the planning process \nfrom the outset. With such investments, accounting for the likely \neffects of future exposure to disaster risk promises to be highly \ncost-effective. A recent study of road investments in Viet\u00a0Nam, \nfor example, showed that the tendency to favor already densely \ndeveloped coastal areas had signi\ufb01cant costs (Balboni 2018). \nWhile the returns on coastal road investments from 2000 to 2010 \nwere positive, a greater concentration of investment inland would \nhave offered higher returns. The\u00a0risk posed by future sea-level \nrise further underscored the inefficiency of coastal investments. \nWelfare gains of some 72% could have been achieved\u00a0by \ninvestment that avoided the most vulnerable regions. \nThe types of infrastructure investments for which disaster \nand climate risk assessment is most relevant can be identi\ufb01ed \nusing a simple framework that considers the following: the \nscale of the project; the extent to which the investment can \nbe expected to affect disaster and climate risk by worsening \ncommunity exposure and vulnerability, either directly or through \nits outputs; the time horizon of the investment, as longer-term \ninvestments require greater scrutiny; and the extent to which the \ninvestment is considered irreversible (Ranger and Garbett-Shiels \n2012). The\u00a0framework should also take into account the expected \nimpact of an investment that attracts further development \ninvestment into a hazard-prone area. Examples of investment \nprojects that most urgently require consideration of disaster \nand climate risk include energy generation, urban green\ufb01eld \ndevelopments, water supply and irrigation systems, and transport \ninfrastructure.\nWhile returns on infrastructure investments are \nsubstantial, especially in developing Asia, public investment \nin infrastructure projects generally raises the thorny issue of \ndecision-making rendered deeply uncertain by climate change.

Uncertainty about \nthe effects of climate change on future disaster risk generally \nshifts the balance of DRM portfolios toward these soft \ninvestments, which are less uncertain (see e.g., McDermott \n2016, Watkiss\u00a02016).\nFinancial management of disasters\nDelays and \ufb01nancing shortfalls can considerably exacerbate \nthe economic and social consequences of direct physical \ndamage from disasters, extending the time required to bring \ninfrastructure back into use and restart service delivery, \nas\u00a0well\u00a0as stymieing efforts to rebuild for greater disaster \nresilience and to revitalize livelihoods and the economy\u2014\nthat is, to \u201cbuild back better,\u201d as the literature discusses \nit.

In some \ncases, governments purchase indemnity insurance to cover a \nportion of public assets (the second layer). Such arrangements \nhave proved to be far from adequate when a major disaster \nstrikes, inevitably requiring unplanned budget reallocations. \nSuch reallocations can take time to secure, particularly if \nbudget realignment can be considered only during scheduled \nmidterm budget reviews and annual budget formulations. \nAd hoc arrangements for disaster risk \ufb01nancing, and related \nuncertainties regarding budget availability, hinder post-disaster \nplanning and the effective use of resources.\nRecognizing these limitations, governments have begun to \nstrengthen options for both risk retention (\ufb01rst layer) and risk \ntransfer (second layer) to enhance their \ufb01nancial preparedness. \nThe Sendai Framework speci\ufb01cally calls for the promotion \nof \u201cmechanisms for disaster risk transfer and insurance, risk \nsharing and retention and \ufb01nancial protection, as appropriate, \nfor both public and private investment in order to reduce the \n\ufb01nancial impact of disasters on governments and societies, \nin\u00a0urban and rural areas\u201d (UN 2015).\nThese efforts have included the increased uptake of \ncontingent \ufb01nancing arrangements, under which pre-negotiated \nlines of \ufb01nancing can be rapidly disbursed in the aftermath \nof a disaster (Box 2.3.4).

Problems\u00a0the poor face in accessing \ufb01nancial services \nimpede their adoption of efficient risk coping strategies, with \nimplications for poverty reduction and development more \ngenerally, as well as for vulnerability to natural hazards.\nWhile many advance risk management strategies, such\u00a0as \ninvestment in disaster-proof housing or disaster insurance, \nare\u00a0cost-effective ways to contain disaster losses (World Bank \nand United Nations 2010), these mechanisms are often absent \nin developing countries, or they are available only to people \nwho are better off. ", "100(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nWhere advance protection is unavailable, households \nattempt to smooth consumption following disasters, using a \nrange of coping responses dependent on their own resources \nand those of their community (Sawada and Shimizutani 2008, \nSawada 2007). Self-reliance can mean reducing nonessential \nconsumption expenditure, spending previously accumulated \nsavings, selling physical assets, taking any additional work that \nis available, using informal credit, obtaining emergency public \ntransfers, and receiving private transfers and credits from the \nextended family network, friends, and neighbors.\nInformal, community-based coping mechanisms are often \nwell developed in poorer communities (Collier, Conway, and \nVenables 2008, Ligon 2008). These informal risk-coping \nmechanisms have been shown to be effective in dealing \nwith isolated shocks to individuals, as evidenced by data on \nhouseholds in Viet Nam (Sawada, Nakata, and Kotera 2017). \nSimilarly, remittances can allow consumption smoothing \nand \ufb01nance home reconstruction. In general, remittances are \ntransferred more rapidly and efficiently than formal\u00a0relief \nefforts, allowing households to recover more quickly, as \nillustrated in a number of case studies, including in Pakistan \nafter an earthquake in 2005, in Samoa after a tsunami in\u00a02009, \nand in Sri Lanka after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Some\u00a0of \nthese gains can be substantial, with one study \ufb01nding that \n\ufb01nancial remittances compensated for nearly 65% of income \nlost to rainfall shocks in the Philippines (Yang and Choi 2007). \nHowever, informal coping mechanisms tend to fail in the \nface of the relatively widespread destruction caused by larger \ndisasters. This is especially true if the coping mechanism relies \non neighbors or other households who were similarly hit by the \ndisaster. Some studies found that remittances often reinforced \nexisting inequality, as most remittances reached those in the \ncommunity who were already better off (Le D\u00e9 et al. 2015). \nStudies in India, Pakistan, and Thailand showed that \n\ufb01nancially constrained households employed various coping \nstrategies after disasters struck, some of which were inefficient, \nsuch as selling productive assets (Dercon 2002), providing \nmore paid labor only to force down wages (Kochar 1999), \nsending children to work rather than to school (Jacoby and \nSkou\ufb01as\u00a01997, Sawada and Lokshin 2009), or borrowing at \nhigh interest from informal lenders (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2011). \nThese risk management strategies undermined investment \nand growth and aggravated poverty (Elbers, Gunning, and \nKinsey\u00a02007).\nIn addition to challenges poorer households face in coping \nwith risk, disasters can affect individual risk perceptions \nand risk aversion, with consequent effects for long-term \ndevelopment. A number of studies have shown how disaster-hit \npopulations became more risk averse following, for example, \nthe direct experience of a \ufb02ood or earthquake in Indonesia ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)101\n(Cameron and Shah 2015) and the 2004 tsunami in Thailand \n(Cassar, Healy, and von Kessler 2017). Similarly, studies using \ndata from diverse locations and situations\u2014a village in the \nPhilippines that was hit by \ufb02ooding in 2012 and a city in Japan \nfollowing the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami\u2014found \nthat being hit by disaster made individuals signi\ufb01cantly more \nfocused on the present than were those unaffected by the \ndisaster, favoring payoffs that came sooner out of doubt for the \nfuture (Sawada and Kuroishi 2015a, 2015b). \nThe effects of disasters on individual preferences suggest \nthat one-off shocks can have long-lasting consequences for \ndevelopment and poverty (Sawada 2017). Relaxing credit and \n\ufb01nancial constraints on the poor could therefore do more than \nhelp them cope better with risk, encouraging them to take on \nriskier investments that have potential to be more productive \n(Castells-Quintana, Lopez-Uribe, and McDermott 2018). \nThese\u00a0\ufb01ndings underline the scope for policy intervention to \nimprove access to \ufb01nancial services and to support temporary \nlabor migration, toward distributing more widely the bene\ufb01ts \nof these effective market mechanisms.\nDisaster insurance to manage disaster risk\nInsurance against disasters arising from natural hazards is \na useful tool to manage climate risk and could, if carefully \nimplemented, make poor and vulnerable communities more \nresilient. However, access to commercial insurance against \ndisasters is limited and unevenly distributed for several \nreasons, including the technical challenge of designing \ninsurance products that are affordable and suitable.\nIn low-income countries, more than 95% of all losses from \nweather and climate hazards were uninsured (Golnaraghi, \nSurminski, and Schanz 2016). Just 6% of losses in \ufb02oods in \nKerala in 2018 were insured, for example, while payouts after \nthe 2018 earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi were reported \nas negligible despite substantial damage (Aon Ben\ufb01eld 2019). \nSimilarly, more than 90% of the affected families surveyed \nafter \ufb02oods in Mumbai, Chennai, and Puri did not have any \nform of insurance, and those who did suffered long delays for \npaltry settlements (Patankar, forthcoming).\nThe bene\ufb01ts of insurance are clear: pooling and \ntransferring risks to \ufb01nancial markets, enabling fairly risk-free \ninvestment, providing incentives for risk reduction, preventing \nhardship, and making post-disaster support more predictable. \nThese features of insurance can alleviate the immediate \nwelfare impacts caused by disasters and contain disruption to \nstate budgets (Hallegatte 2014, Clarke and Dercon 2016). ", "102(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nRecent years have seen the introduction of new insurance \ndesigns, especially across developing Asia, and a shift from \ntraditional indemnity-based policies toward indexed insurance \n(Box\u00a02.3.5). Microinsurance and the bundling of insurance with \ncredit can confer additional advantages, as they not only enable \nbetter risk management but also render individuals more \ncreditworthy and promote investment in productive assets that \nmay otherwise be too risky. \nAt the same time, advances in disaster risk modeling \nfacilitate more accurate pricing of risk transfer instruments. \nAs\u00a0margins of uncertainty built into insurance premiums \nbecome narrower, premiums become more affordable. \nInnovations in parametric insurance\u2014which pays \ncompensation following the tripping of agreed triggers that are \nreadily measured, such as maximum wind speed or millimeters \nof precipitation, rather than for actual loss\u2014mean lower costs \nfor damage assessment and therefore further reductions in \npremium prices, as well as quicker settlements.\nProgress is being made in establishing regional parametric \ninsurance pools, which offer opportunities to reduce premiums \nthrough a number of mechanisms (ADB 2018e):\n(i) Diversifying risk reduces volatility in losses \nexperienced by the group. \n(ii) Absorbing the \ufb01rst layer of loss from pool reserves \nreduces the cost of the reinsurance required to \nprotect the pool, as does collective bargaining when \nnegotiating reinsurance. \n(iii) Shared administrative costs make the creation and \nmanagement of the pool more affordable. \nA regional sovereign disaster insurance pool was launched \nunder the second phase of the Paci\ufb01c Catastrophe Risk \nAssessment and Financing Initiative in 2017. A pool is planned \nfor several countries under the Southeast Asia Disaster\u00a0Risk \nInsurance Facility. A city disaster insurance pool is currently \nunder development in the Philippines with support from\u00a0ADB. \nSome subnational governments have entered into contracts \ndirectly with insurance companies, an example of which is \nSwiss\u00a0Reinsurance Company Limited parametric insurance \nissued to PRC provincial governments in Guangdong and \nHeilongjiang.\nA range of nonsovereign products is also being piloted \nand launched. The PRC, which has subsidized agricultural \ninsurance since the 1980s, is now one of the world\u2019s largest \nagricultural insurance markets, and a substantial subsidized \nagricultural insurance market exists in India as well. In \nIndonesia, insurance companies\u2019 compulsory cession of \nearthquake risk to a specialist earthquake reinsurer has been \nin force since 2004.", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)103\nRemaining challenges to greater \ndisaster\u00a0insurance penetration\nWhile observed trends indicate a growing role for insurance \nas part of broader DRM strategies, a number of challenges \nremain. Most straightforward are the standard concerns \nof traditional indemnity insurers over moral hazard and \nadverse selection. For example, Adachi et al. (2016) found that \ncommercial property insurance subscription before the 2011 \nThailand \ufb02ood was systematically higher among \ufb01rms located \nin the areas directly affected by the \ufb02ood than elsewhere, \nindicating adverse selection. Moreover, the study showed \nthat insured \ufb01rms and those receiving business interruption \npayouts had lower production and employment after the \ufb02ood, \nsuggesting a moral hazard. Concerns about adverse selection \nand moral hazard may be particularly pronounced when \ncoverage for small policyholders, such as farmers and smaller \nbusinesses, makes observing mitigation efforts and assessing \nlosses expensive. \nIndexed insurance, under which claim payments are \ntriggered by an indexed event such as precipitation below \nsome prede\ufb01ned threshold for drought insurance, offers an \nalternative as it overcomes concerns about moral hazard \nwhile reducing monitoring costs (Clarke and Grenham 2013). \nIndexed\u00a0coverage can also facilitate accelerated claim payment, \nwhich is important especially for poor households. \nIndexed insurance is bene\ufb01cial, though, only if the index \ncorrelates closely with actual damage. Basis risk\u2014a mismatch \nbetween the triggering index and actual damage\u2014can be \nsigni\ufb01cant, making insurance more like a lottery than a \nmechanism to transfer risk. \nAn especially problematic situation is when indexed \nmicroinsurance for vulnerable households leaves them \nuncompensated for damage and disappointed, because the \nindex did not trigger a payment. Signi\ufb01cant basis risk of this \nkind can erode trust in insurance companies and suppress \ndemand for their insurance products.\nAs disaster insurance takes on large regional risks rather \nthan smaller individual ones, risk can be spread, or reinsured, \nacross wide geographical areas with varying disaster risk \npro\ufb01les. One suggested solution is to combine indemnity and \nindexed insurance. Community mutual insurance groups \ncould provide indemnity insurance against individual shocks, \nthe system backed by indexed insurance for the community, \noffering protection against aggregate shocks by transferring the \nrisk to reinsurers (Clarke and Grenham 2013).

These aspirations may sound utopian, but they are \nnonetheless achievable, even if only rarely so far. To turn\u00a0utopia \ninto policy, operationalize BBB. \nGovernance challenges\nBeyond a better definition of BBB, and before any attempt to define \nthe path leading to BBB, it is necessary to address the governance \nchallenges that are typically posed in the aftermath of a disaster. \nThe recovery phase can be a very fluid time with opportunities \npoised against the many barriers and obstacles that seem \nto dominate the landscape. A demand surge for specialized \nconstruction services after an earthquake, for example, can \nnurture the emergence of a thriving seismic engineering \nknowledge industry that can become a future service export when \nthis knowledge is required elsewhere. However, many of these \npotential benefits require active policy decisions and mechanisms \nthat facilitate useful developments. Without them, such nascent \nopportunities will be missed. More\u00a0fundamentally, overcoming \nthe many barriers and obstacles that are always present in \npost-disaster recovery equally demands active management of \nthese\u00a0challenges.\nOften, post-disaster financing is at the forefront of planning \nfor reconstruction and recovery. However, such a focus does not \nadequately address the implementation challenges associated with \npost-disaster operations. Past experience amply demonstrates that \na lack of access to finance is not the only barrier to a swift return \nto normality (Hallegatte, Rentschler, and Walsh 2018, Mochizuki, \nHallwright, and Handmer, forthcoming). Even with financing \navailable, governments, firms, and households often struggle to \nreconstruct and recover. \nThe efficient and productive use of disaster risk finance, \nwhen it is available, is frequently stymied by the complex \ngovernance landscape of post-disaster operations and its multiple \nactors. Even when agreements clearly define responsibilities, \nlocal administrative capacity may be overwhelmed by the due \ndiligence and reporting requirements of a highly fragmented \nresponse\u00a0community. \nOvercoming these obstacles requires comprehensive disaster \nrisk financing strategies. They should go beyond developing \ndisaster risk financing instruments by also enhancing budget \nexecution capacity so that financing can be used promptly and \neffectively. Adequate procedures for appropriating, disbursing, \nand monitoring the use of post-disaster funding, and capacity to \nimplement them, are essential for successful mobilization and \nrecovery. Adequate emergency procurement regulations and \ncapacity, including advance contracting arrangements, are also key. ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)113\nIn other cases, partly because of failure to consult \nwith local entities, stakeholders, and the people directly \naffected, governments may underestimate the obstacles and \nopportunities in the post-disaster environment. Population \nmovements, skills bottlenecks, and inflation in a construction \nboom can all delay procurement and rebuilding. \nIn general, it helps tremendously to have the roles and \nresponsibilities of external and internal actors clearly codified \nin formal frameworks and policy guidelines. That said, without \nexperiential knowledge gained from past recovery processes, \nand without mutual trust, any predetermined plan for \nreconstruction and recovery is prone to implementation failure \nin the chaos of post-disaster operations. If no such plan exists, \nand the actors lack experience, the governance challenges \nposed by this process are immense.\nOne crucial need for building experiential knowledge is \nto institutionalize lessons from previous events. Disasters \nare opportunities to develop this knowledge toward better \nmanaging the next disaster. Quantitative evidence shows that \ncountries that have experienced frequent smaller disasters are \nbetter able to handle large ones. \nPreparing for recovery funding \nOvercoming all these governance challenges requires enablers \nthat are both explicit and tacit. Explicit enablers facilitate \nsetting up appropriate institutions, getting access to recovery \nfinancing, and establishing with clarity participants\u2019 roles and \nresponsibilities by drafting pre-disaster plans and frameworks. \nTacit enablers provide opportunities for building trust, gaining \nexperiential knowledge through joint simulation exercises, \nand fostering the operational knowledge and capacity local \nstaff need to handle the complex administrative demands of \nthe post-disaster period. Explicit and tacit enablers are equally \nimportant to the success of BBB.\nGoverning post-disaster operations is a complex \nundertaking in under-resourced environments. This is partly \nbecause the availability of sufficient external assistance is \nunpredictable, but also because multiple external and domestic \nactors must be mobilized and coordinated despite varying and \npotentially conflicting recovery priorities and disagreements \nover them. \nWhile immediate humanitarian needs are fulfilled through \na large variety of funding sources, formal channels for the \nfunds necessary for long-term recovery and reconstruction \nare typically the product of a post-disaster needs assessment \nand conferences called in response to requests for external \nassistance and support from the national government. ", "114(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nImmediate humanitarian relief is typically coordinated \nnationally and supported internationally through an \nestablished protocol using a cluster approach, as was \ndone in Nepal through the National Disaster Response \nFramework (Box 2.4.2). In\u00a0contrast, long-term recovery and \nreconstruction is primarily led by national, subnational, and \nlocal governments.

Defining governance arrangements \nand codifying them through legislative action before a disaster \nstrikes is particularly important. While the details will always \nbe specific to particular disasters, the main framework for \ngoverning the recovery process should be decided ahead of\u00a0time.\nAfter a disaster, the assessment of needs has conventionally \nbeen implemented as a technical exercise using information \non economic damage and the country\u2019s access to domestic and \nexternal resources. Yet more can be achieved toward facilitating \nthe implementation of post-disaster BBB if, in the needs-\nassessment phase, a plan for BBB is already incorporated into the \ndecision-making process. \nGovernments and domestic stakeholders should ensure \nthat roles and responsibilities are clearly defined in all phases \nof post-disaster operations. In particular, though, they should \nplan in advance for the recovery and reconstruction phases \nof the disaster cycle. Emphasis should be placed on setting \nclear mandates within the ministries of national governments \nregarding the coordination of financing, operations, and \nmonitoring of disaster response, recovery, and reconstruction. \nPre-disaster training and simulations should clarify roles and \nresponsibilities across government departments, as well as units\u2019 \nrelationships with international and domestic partners in the \nprivate sector and civil society. \nOften missing in contingency planning are procedures \nfor a transition from emergency response to recovery and \nreconstruction over the medium and long term. Setting up \nexplicit rules and systems is only part of what is required, but a \npart that often plagues post-disaster reconstruction. Local staff \nand partners should have sufficient training and knowledge \nbefore the disaster to effectively follow plans and procedures \nwhen pressed for time in the post-disaster phase. Capacity-\nbuilding programs should therefore target international, \nnational, and local actors alike, including the government, \nprivate firms, and civil society, and should elaborate the details \nof operational processes and any requirements related to \nexternal disaster risk financing and ways of preparing domestic \nfinancial, accounting, and accountability systems to scale up \ntheir operations as necessary after a disaster strikes.\nTo summarize, the United Nations International Strategy \nfor Disaster Reduction notes that national governments \nwould benefit greatly by creating a functional and productive \nenvironment where stakeholders appreciate the importance \nof a build-back-better mindset after disasters (UNISDR 2017). ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)117\nThis\u00a0should ideally be supported by national laws and equitably \nenforced, with all necessary resources\u2014human, financial, and \notherwise\u2013made readily available. Able leadership and good \ngovernance are essential to provide the support mechanisms \nneeded for such a strategy. \nExternal bene\ufb01ts of post-disaster \nreconstruction and recovery\nSupporting evidence for \u201ccreative destruction\u201d dynamics \nthat arise organically in post-disaster reconstruction appears \nto be limited to several cases, such as the 2008 Wenchuan \nearthquake in the PRC (Box 2.4.3). Nevertheless these few \ncases point to what a government can do to improve outcomes. \nOne is to offer generous funding to build resilience. After\u00a0the \n2008 earthquake, the Government of the PRC spent a very \nlarge amount of money to build more seismically robust \ninfrastructure. \nAnother way that recovery can engender favorable BBB \noutcomes, even if not deliberately, is for reconstruction to \ncreate positive externalities that enable development to speed \nup, bringing benefits that would have come only later, if at \nall, without reconstruction as a trigger. One vintage example \ncan be found in an analysis of the Great Boston Fire of 1872 \n(Hornbeck and Keniston 2017). The study found that the \nreconstruction of individual properties rendered benefits to \nnearby properties that facilitated their development as well. \nThe fire and the resulting need to reconstruct destroyed \nbuildings, it seems, accelerated urban renewal that otherwise \nwould have taken much longer.\nProgress through technological leap-frogging is another \npossibility, though infrequently realized. Hornbeck and \nNaidu (2014) found that the Great Mississippi Flood\u00a0of\u00a01927 \naccelerated the modernization of agriculture in the \narea through mechanization that was forced in part by \nlabor shortages occasioned by the outward migration of \nsharecroppers. According to the study, it was this shortage of \nlabor created by the flood that drove farmers to adopt new \ntechnologies. \nHowever, evidence exists that, even in a strong post-\ndisaster recovery enjoying generous financing from domestic \nand international sources, such as insurance and development \nassistance, the outcome can be a worsening of structural social \ninequality. This may happen because households with more \nincome are better able to withstand disasters and to benefit \nfrom long-term changes in the post-disaster environment \n(De\u00a0Alwis and Noy, forthcoming).

An example from Viet Nam is instructive. \nRural households in Viet\u00a0Nam cope with disasters mainly \nby sending family members into urban areas (Gr\u00f6ger and \nZylberberg 2016). As is common in lower-income countries, \nonly selected members of households are able migrate away \nfrom disaster-affected areas. Often, those displaced by a storm \nopt not to return. While the migrants\u2019 households benefit \nfrom remittances, the affected region ends up with a lower \npopulation and therefore less economic activity. \nConversely, disasters can motivate migration into the \naffected region. They may be attracted by spending on \nreconstruction, by the structural changes brought about by \nthe recovery spending, or even by risk reduction achieved \nafter the disaster. Such dynamics were evident in population \nincreases seen in areas in the Netherlands affected by the \nNorth Sea Flood in 1953, for instance, as these places benefited \nfrom a large public works program aiming to strengthen flood \nprotection in flood-prone areas (Husby et al. 2014). In-migration \ncan also reflect a surge in job opportunities, particularly in the \nbuilding industry, that may be only temporary. ", "120(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nVoluntary migration into and out of affected areas can \ntherefore, under certain circumstances, enhance resilience and \nimprove well-being. Governments sometimes try to convince \ninhabitants of affected areas to relocate away from the most \nhazard-prone area by, for example, banning home construction \nwithin a certain distance of the shoreline. \nMuch better data is required on the length of post-disaster \nmigration in and out of affected areas to really grasp its drivers \nand implications. Only then will it be possible to develop \nappropriate policies and measures to manage migration well and \nencourage optimal flows of people.\nPolicy aims of building back better\n\u201cBuild back safer\u201d may be a better tagline than build back better \nbecause \u201cbetter\u201d can mean many things, some of which may \nactually worsen risk by, for example, increasing population \ndensity. \u201cSafer\u201d provides a clearer goal to focus on during \nrecovery, especially with respect to reconstructing residential \nand commercial buildings. The thinking behind this emphasis is \nthat safety should trump all other aspirations for post-disaster \nrecovery (Kennedy et al. 2008). \nIn many cases, however, there are other aims that \nresidents and policy makers hope to achieve with recovery and \nreconstruction. These aims can impose trade-offs that need to be \ncarefully balanced to avoid jeopardizing the goal of maintaining \nor strengthening safety. Important questions need to be asked \nwhen following BBB principles after a disaster (Kennedy et al. \n2008): Will recovery ensure safety and security? What will be \nthe impact on the affected community? Is it fair and equitable, \nand does it tackle the root causes of vulnerability?\nFollowing this logic, the World Bank has suggested three \nseparate components to building back better: stronger, faster, \nand more inclusive (Hallegatte, Rentschler, and Walsh 2018). \nIn line with this approach, it has been argued that building \nback stronger may have a different connotation than, say, \nbuilding back safer. This would be the case if, for example, \nsafety standards called for construction methods and standards \nthat could reasonably ensure that lives would not be lost as a \nconsequence of a disaster but not necessarily that the buildings \nwould be stronger and continue to be habitable after the disaster. \nHowever, even these goals can impose trade-offs that ought to \nbe carefully considered during reconstruction and recovery, \nespecially considering that, ultimately and most fundamentally, \nthe process should end with resilience enhanced enough for the \ncommunity to survive future disasters and more generally thrive \nin future circumstances. The\u00a0number of BBB components can \nthus be extended to four: safety, speed, fairness and inclusivity, \nand future social and economic potential. ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)121\nBuilding back a safer environment\nReducing the risk of mortality and morbidity in future events is \nan uncontroversial goal of recovery and reconstruction in the \naftermath of any adverse event. One important observation is \nthat, unlike a lot of the other impacts of disasters, mortality and \nmorbidity are irreversible. As such, it is clear why preventing \nthem should be the overriding goal of reconstruction and \nrecovery policies. All things considered, preventing mortality and \nmorbidity is always likely to be the most important goal guiding \ngovernment policy after a disaster. It seems indisputable that \nsafety should be prioritized because the consequences of unsafe\u2014\nor less safe\u2014reconstruction would affect harmed individuals and \ntheir families for a very long\u00a0time. \nHallegatte, Rentschler, and Walsh (2018) used the term \n\u201cstronger\u201d instead of \u201csafer.\u201d This implied reconstructing houses, \npublic buildings, and transportation and other infrastructure \nin ways that make them more able to resist the onslaught of an \nextreme disaster. If the hazard is an earthquake, for example, this \nsuggests rebuilding with more robust construction methods so \nthat buildings will not collapse when shaken. Safety can also be \nachieved, however, through softer defenses\u2014the classic example \nof which is mangrove forests to counter risks from storm surges\u2014\nor by retreating from dangerous locations altogether (Hino et al. \n2017). Improved safety post-disaster can be achieved by other \npolicies as well, ones that do not entail strong, hard, or soft \nengineering solutions. \nEven further from bricks-and-mortar concerns but \nmaybe no less important is the strengthening of social ties \nwithin communities. This was found to be important in \npreventing mortality in the 2011 tsunami in Japan (Aldrich and \nSawada\u00a02015). Safety under tsunami risk depends on timely \nwarnings and the ability to evacuate. Social ties allow the timely \nevacuation of people, such as the elderly, who would find it \ndifficult to evacuate independently. Therefore, one can build back \na safer community by establishing mechanisms that strengthen \nsocial\u00a0ties. This\u00a0can\u00a0be achieved in many ways, for example \nthrough the spatial planning of residential neighborhoods. \nBuilding back faster for well-being\nRebuilding at a faster pace is also a fairly obvious and \nuncontroversial goal of public policy. All things being equal, \na faster recovery is always better than a slower one. Speed is \noften motivated as well by political and electoral pressures. \nSurprisingly, though, governments sometimes do not realize \nthat speeding up recovery is achievable and should be seen \nas an explicit policy goal. For example, many post-disaster \nsituations give rise to complicated legal questions that need to be \nresolved in court, such as on property rights, insurance liability, \nand the role of the various branches of government versus ", "122(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nthe private\u00a0sector. Governments should make every effort to \nspeed this up and purposely remove any bottleneck that delays \nreconstruction and recovery. \nIn Sichuan, the government made a conscious and concerted \neffort to speed up recovery even as it benefited greatly from the \nabundant resources made available to finance reconstruction. \nIn\u00a0many cases, lack of funding is a stubborn bottleneck \nimpeding reconstruction. Indeed, recovery in Sichuan was much \nfaster than in other disaster-affected areas\u2014in Myanmar, for \nexample, in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Nargis in 2008, \nor even in high-income Japan during reconstruction following \nthe 2011\u00a0earthquake and tsunami. There are other barriers \nand hurdles to the process, however, so funding cannot be \nconsidered a guarantee of rapid reconstruction. \nThe more difficult problem is when the desire to speed\u00a0up \nrecovery conflicts with other explicit aims of the BBB \nframework. There may even be a trade-off between speed and \nsafety. If, for example, the disaster uncovered vulnerability \nor exposure that was not recognized before\u2014perhaps with \nthe discovery of a previously unknown seismic fault line\u2014\nit\u00a0may take some time to investigate and determine the best \ncorrective action, which may be an appropriate engineering \nsolution. In\u00a0such cases, building back safer may require a more \ndeliberative process.\nThe desire for speed clearly conflicts with the desire \nto consult with the affected local community and seek its \nparticipation, and it typically conflicts as well with the desire \nto carefully consider all plausible development, planning, and \nreconstruction paths. Many of these alternative paths entail \nsignificant planning effort and require reallocating property \nrights for certain assets, the most difficult of which is almost \nalways land. Alternative paths are challenging to implement \nin the best of times, and this is clearly one reason why speed \ndoes not seem to be a priority in many reconstruction projects. \nThe\u00a0existence of a trade-off between speed and a carefully \nconsidered reconstruction path is undeniable, but, all things \nbeing equal, speed should be prioritized. A slow recovery makes \nachieving a build-back-better recovery more difficult.\nBuilding back inclusively for a fairer community \nRecovery should aim to be fair and inclusive in both process \nand outcome. If recovery does not include consultations with \ncommunities and other stakeholders that were affected by the \nevent and will be affected by reconstruction, it is not inclusive \nin process. While there may be a lot of advantages to having \nrecovery guided by an authority tied to the central government \nand funded by it, the need to continuously consult with those \nthat are directly affected is not diminished and may even be \nstrengthened. ", "Strengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)123\nWithout adequate consultation, there will be no buy-in from \nthe local community and no assurance that the right decisions \nwill be made and supported. It is not unusual for recovery to \nbe derailed or delayed when disagreements or tensions arise \nbetween\u00a0affected communities and the authority guiding recovery. \nThe\u00a0aim\u00a0of bringing all community stakeholders into the decision-\nmaking process is to ensure both that the recovery trajectory \nis in the right direction and will achieve its stated build-back-\nbetter aims, and that community participation will smooth and \nspeed up the process by preventing misunderstandings and \nmiscommunication.\nIt is well known that affected communities are themselves \nthe first responders in disasters, often with little or no \nimmediate external support. Often overlooked is that local \ncommunities are also the key to ensuring sustained recovery and \nreconstruction. New evidence from flood resilience surveys across \n88\u00a0communities in Asia shows that community investments can \nbuild resilience while delivering broader development benefits, \nsuch as better education, transportation, and food supply. \nWithout\u00a0close community participation, these shared benefits \nwill not be recognized (Box 2.3.6). Recent\u00a0experience from major \nearthquakes and tropical cyclones in Asia emphasizes also the \nimportance of local communities and actors as custodians of local \nknowledge and experience that can be pivotal to the effective \ndelivery of humanitarian response and recovery efforts.\nToward maintaining a fair and inclusive process, it must \nbe monitored carefully to see who might be excluded from it. \nThe benefits of the build-back-better process must be received \nby all segments of society, especially the most disadvantaged. \nNoteworthy in this context are the many research projects that \nhave observed recoveries frequently excluding the poorest and \nmost vulnerable (Karim and Noy 2016, Hallegatte et\u00a0al.\u00a02016b, and \nPatankar, forthcoming). Given the overwhelming evidence of how \nrecovery often fails to reach the disadvantaged, it\u00a0is apparent that \nplanning for building back better needs to incorporate ways to \nensure that the weakest segments of society are included and are \nempowered during post-disaster reconstruction.\nBuilding back social and economic potential \nPost-disaster recovery should aim to generate potential for \nimproved social well-being and expanded economic opportunity. \nWithout improvement, the quality of life will eventually \ndeteriorate (Sen 2000, Friedman 2006). A\u00a0fair,\u00a0fast,\u00a0and safe \nrecovery does not necessarily mean that the reconstructed city \nor community will have more social and economic potential \nor opportunities than it did before. Yet without that social and \neconomic potential, the build-back strategy will fail. ", "124(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\nPolicy should therefore focus not only on the goals of safety, \nspeed, and fairness but also strive to create conditions that will \nensure gainful employment and stronger social ties toward \nimproving community well-being. A cautionary tale might be \nKobe, Japan, where reconstruction after an earthquake in 1995 \nwas fast, safe, and most likely fair, but nevertheless brought a \nreduction in economic opportunity (duPont et al. 2015). \nPolicy makers at all levels should strive for a reconstruction \nframework that not only preserves previously available \nsocial amenities and economic activity, but aims to move the \ncommunity toward livelihoods that are sustainable over the \nlong term and toward social relationships that can support the \ncommunity for many years to come. In many cases, preserving \nthe economic opportunities and social ties that were there \nbefore the disaster might not even be feasible any more. \nIn\u00a0these cases, it is even more important for the authorities \nto be proactive in identifying and generating conditions that \nwill foster long-term social strength and economic prosperity. \nUltimately, without renewed social and economic potential, \na\u00a0sustainable build-back-better recovery is not possible.\nMuch accomplished, much more to do\nThe risks posed by the heightened impact of disasters in \nAsia, especially in the lower-income countries of the region, \nare manifestly real. Damage and losses can propagate across \ntime and space, causing widespread and prolonged adverse \nimpacts on society and the economy. However, citizens, firms, \ncivil\u00a0society, governments, and multilateral institutions can do \na great deal to mitigate the dangers posed by disasters, avert \ntheir consequences, and manage the aftermath. The growing \nseriousness of problem indicates commensurate room for \nimprovement on all fronts. \nLow-hanging fruit is ready to be picked: better early \nwarning systems for disasters; greater investment in \nprotection\u00a0by, for example, building cyclone or tsunami \nshelters; contingency funds made automatically available after \ntheir triggering events; and more policy attention to planning \nrecovery in advance, rather than having to scramble in the \nemergency phase.\nPlenty more can and should be done to initiate change in the \nability of societies to pursue the aims of the Sendai Framework \nAgreement, which focuses on four priorities for action:\nPriority 1. Understanding disaster risk.\nPriority 2. Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage \ndisaster risk.\nPriority 3. Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience.\nPriority 4.

Remittances and exports of commodities \nmay fuel growth, but they are vulnerable to external shocks. \nArmenia has responded by diversifying its export base, yet \nexports of goods with high value added remain small. To address \nthese problems and ensure stable and more inclusive growth, \nArmenia\u2019s capacity for innovation must be strengthened.", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia  Armenia\u2002\u2002147\nIn its Global Competitiveness Report 2018, the World Economic \nForum ranked innovation capacity in Armenia at 60 out of \n135 economies and 14 out of 34 peers in the upper-middle-\nincome category. While Armenia scores well on international \nco-invention, patent applications, and buyer sophistication, \nit compares less favorably on workforce diversity, research \nand development (R&D) spending, the quality of its research \ninstitutions, and its use of cluster development. Addressing these \nissues and promoting a knowledge-based economy depends on the \nsuccessful implementation of comprehensive education, science, \ntechnology, and innovation policies. Among key government \nobjectives are upgrading Armenia\u2019s scientific infrastructure, \nensuring a steady rise in the number of highly skilled workers, \nstrengthening innovation, and internationalizing science and \ninnovation. Specific targets for certain objectives appear in an \ninnovation concept paper the government approved in 2011 and \nin other documents, notably Strategy on Development of Science \n2011\u20132020 and Science and Technology Priorities 2015\u20132029. \nSuccessful policy implementation requires an enabling \nenvironment, support for human capital development, aid for \nR&D and innovation in private firms, and more integrated \ninnovation systems. As human capital is especially important, \ninnovation capacity depends crucially on the quality of education, \nparticularly in science and technology, and the availability of \nworkers with the necessary technical skills. Armenia has made \nconsiderable progress, and IT-related services now provide more \nthan 11% of service exports, 16% of all services, and 5% of GDP. \nContinued rapid expansion in IT depends on enhanced education \nto meet the industry\u2019s growing demand for highly skilled workers. \nIn particular, the quality of science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics education must be improved by modernizing \nteaching and learning materials and by going beyond existing \ninitiatives and projects to develop and promote techno-parks, \ninnovation incubators, R&D centers opened and operated by \nglobal\u00a0companies, IT classes, school engineering labs, and after-\nschool learning platforms.\nThough Armenia\u2019s skills base is evolving, R&D capacity \nand efforts still lag. R&D spending equaled only 0.3% of GDP \nin 2018, or barely one-six of the 1.8% average in upper-middle-\nincome economies. Measures to support innovation must be \ncomprehensively inventoried before they can be streamlined \nand reoriented. Flexible financing arrangements that include \nincentives and other cost-effective support could allow firms to \nimprove their performance and become more willing to undertake \nthe risks inherent in developing new products and services. \nThe government is providing R&D and physical facilities for \ntechnology-based firms through a program called Engineering \nCity and Engineering Cluster, designed to help firms and \nuniversities combine their efforts to commercialize research \nproducts and catalyze the growth of high-tech companies.", "Azerbaijan\nGDP growth strengthened in 2018 as expansion in services and agriculture continued, \nand as industry contracted less.

While this was a step in the right direction, other \nanomalies remain. First, pension contribution rates are set by \neach province and vary from 14% in Zhejiang and Guangdong \nto 19%\u201320% in most other provinces (though capped at 16% \nfrom May 2019, following the recent decision). Moreover, these \ncontributions are pooled within provinces. These features limit \nthe transferability of pensions nationwide and probably hinder \nlabor mobility. According to the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, \n2016\u20132020, pension contributions should be pooled nationwide \nby 2020. Attaining this goal may prove challenging. Pooling has \nbeen hampered by slow progress in standardizing contribution \nrates and because richer provinces see national pooling as \nredistribution. Yet addressing the problems of underreporting \nand nationwide pooling are essential to enhance efficiency and \ncreate room to lower nominal contribution rates.

The average contribution \nrate for employees is 11%, similar to the average in the same \ncomparator group. Though an employee\u2019s salary in the previous \nyear serves as the basis for SSCs, those employees earning \nbelow a threshold must pay a fixed minimum amount, and \nthose earning above a threshold pay a fixed maximum amount. \nThe lower threshold is generally set at 60% of the previous \nyear\u2019s average local wage, and the top threshold at 300%. \nTo reduce their contributions, companies often underreport \nemployee salaries to the social security administration, which \ncannot check the reports because it has no access to tax data. \nAccording to a 2018 white paper on social security, only 27% \nof surveyed enterprises paid the full SSC based on employees\u2019 \nactual salaries. Others either based payments on underreported \nemployee salaries or paid the minimum contribution per \nemployee. These practices suppress the effective rate of SSCs, \nincluding for pensions. To consolidate the SSC base before \nlowering the contribution rate, the government decided to \ntransfer authority for SSC collection from the Ministry of \nHuman Resources and Social Security to the State Taxation \nAdministration, to which salaries are reported for tax\u00a0purposes. \nThis promised to make systematic underreporting more \ndifficult. However, the transfer, which was to occur on \n1\u00a0January 2019, was postponed in response to resistance from \nemployers that feared having to pay higher contributions as a \nresult. Despite\u00a0such resistance, the transfer of authority should \nbe pursued and speeded up to streamline the collection of SSCs. \nFinally, the government should pay legacy costs that arise \nfrom obligations to retirees who became eligible for state \npensions when the pension system was modified in\u00a01997. \nTo\u00a0raise pension fund revenues toward financing these \npayments, the government should implement its plans to raise \nboth the share of state-owned enterprise equity transferred \nto the pension fund, which currently stands at 10%, and the \ndividends state-owned enterprises pay out to their shareholders.", "Republic of Korea\nDespite  strong  consumption  and  net  exports,  growth  slowed  in  2018.

Considered together with a \nrapidly aging population, this trend raises concern over the \nprospects for economic growth in the long term. However, \ndemographic change aside, the ROK retains an abundance of \nyouthful energy. As recent research by Edward Lazear shows, \nyouthful countries tend to be entrepreneurial. Fostering youth \nentrepreneurship is therefore key to catalyzing growth and to \nreducing youth unemployment, which has emerged in recent \nyears as a major economic and social issue. \nAccording to surveys by the Korea Institute of Startup & \nEntrepreneurship Development, entrepreneurship among those \n29 years old and under is anemic. While the number of startups ", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia  Republic of Korea\u2002\u2002207\nin the ROK rose by 6.4% in 2013\u20132015, youth startups plunged  3.12.10\u2002 Total early stage entrepreneurial \nby 40.5%, and their share of the total dropped from 3.0% to  activity, 2016\n0.9%. The rate at which youth startups survive is significantly  18\u201324 years old\n25\u201330 years old\nlower than the overall rate. Further, according to the Global \nEntrepreneurship Monitor, youth entrepreneurship in the ROK \n%\nas a share of all startups nationally substantially lags behind  20\nother innovative economies such as Israel, the PRC, and the US  16\n(Figure 3.12.10). The Hyundai Research Institute reports that  12\nyouth entrepreneurship in the ROK tends to be skewed toward  8\nwholesale and retail trade, accommodation, and restaurants,  4\nwhere entry barriers such as technological knowhow  0\nrequirements are low but the potential to create high-quality  ROK GER FIN ISR PRC US\nISR = Israel, FIN = Finland, GER = Germany, \njobs is limited.

It\u00a0has taken other steps to create an environment \nthat encourages private firms and financial institutions to \ndiscover, nurture, and invest in or acquire promising startups. \nThese\u00a0steps facilitated an increase by more than 10% per year \nin new private venture capital investments from 2011 to 2015, \nenabling more startups. Going forward, any initiatives and \nfiscal incentives that the government offers should be directed, \nto the extent possible, to the more innovative industries and \nactivities, and to those that promise to create the most jobs. \nExcessive regulation remains another major impediment \nto innovative entrepreneurship. In stark contrast with the US \nand the PRC, which enforce negative lists of activities and \ntechnologies closed to startups, the ROK has a more restrictive \npositive list that specifies only a few business activities and \nareas open to them. Without a fundamental overhaul of this \nstifling regulatory framework, innovative entrepreneurship is \nunlikely to put down roots in the ROK. \nRegulations could be relaxed to allow, in particular, \nthe establishment of \u201csandbox zones,\u201d in which youth \nentrepreneurs are free to develop new products and services \nand to experiment with fresh ideas, constrained by only \nminimal regulation. Policy support can be extended for \nyouth entrepreneurs to venture abroad at an early stage of \ntheir enterprise development to get a sense of the global \nmarketplace. Meanwhile, the successful transformation of \nscience and technology universities in the US into vibrant \ncradles of youth entrepreneurship, such as the Martin Trust \nCenter for Entrepreneurship at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, can provide models for enhancing education in \nthe\u00a0ROK.", "Taipei,China\nSofter external demand tamped down growth in 2018, and inflation remained low even \nas it doubled with higher food and transportation prices.

According to the Afghanistan \nLiving Conditions Survey, conducted in 2016 and 2017, only 36% \nof the population has access to safe drinking water nationally, \nincluding 75% of urban households but only 25% of rural households. \nOnly 31% of the population is connected to the electric grid, the \nprimary source of electrical power in urban areas with penetration \nat 92%, but reaching only 13% in rural areas.

Similarly, underdeveloped road and rail \ntransport infrastructure impedes connectivity between ports \nand production centers, slowing production and making it more \nexpensive. While India has substantially improved the quality \nof its roads, according to the Global Competitiveness Index, \nthe quality of its electricity supply trails that of other emerging \nmarkets. Sectors like electrical and optical equipment, \ntransport equipment and chemicals, and rubber and plastics \nhave the potential to be further integrated into GVCs if these \nimpediments are resolved.\nLimitations on the finance available for infrastructure \nargue for concentrating investments in industrial zones. \nInfrastructure can be developed within such zones with \ncosts shared by the firms present in them, reducing the \ninfrastructure investment required of individual firms. \nThese\u00a0zones can be strategically located near transport hubs \nand linked with ports and airports that have better road and \nrail infrastructure.\nFinally, skills development can help countries enhance \ntheir productivity gains from participation in GVCs. It allows \ncountries and industries to specialize in higher and medium \ntechnology production and in complex business services like \nchemicals, electrical and optical equipment, and finance and \ninsurance with potential to foster innovation and productivity \ngrowth. India faces a formidable challenge in this area, as \nonly an estimated 4.7% of its workforce has received formal \ntraining, much lower than in other large economies of Asia: \nJapan at 80%, the PRC at 24%, and the Republic of Korea at \n96%. To close this gap, policies on skills development need to \nbe designed to meet the requirements of both low- and high-\ntechnology manufacturing and complex services. It would be \nprudent to design policies that improve skills across different \nsegments of industries and not focus on too narrow a selection, \nto avoid misallocation.

Third is to keep tourism environmentally friendly and \nsustainable.\nTourism is constrained in the South Pacific \neconomies by underdeveloped infrastructure, which \nconfines and concentrates these industries in accessible \nareas.

The Cook Islands has not had a major disaster \nrecently, but Samoa struggled to expand its tourism industry \nafter the 2009 tsunami, which pushed earnings to as low as \nthe equivalent of 16.6% of GDP in the years that followed. \nThis highlights the country\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters \nand the need for tourism to remain sustainable over the long \nrun.

The economies are grouped into five subregions: Central Asia, \nEast\u00a0Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Most of the tables \ncontain historical data from 2014 to 2018; some have forecasts for 2019 \nand\u00a02020.\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in \nstatistical methodology, definitions, coverage, and practices make full \ncomparability impossible. The national income accounts section is based \non the United\u00a0Nations System of National Accounts, while the data on \nbalance of payments use International Monetary Fund (IMF) accounting \nstandards. Historical data were obtained from official sources, statistical \npublications, and databases, as well as the documents of ADB, the IMF, and \nthe World\u00a0Bank. For some economies, data for 2018 were estimated from \nthe latest available information.

The table shows annual \ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, or \nbasic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of value added \nby all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes less \nsubsidies on imports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar taxes. \nConstant\u00a0factor cost measures differ from market price measures in \nthat they exclude taxes on production and include subsidies. Basic\u00a0price \nvaluation is the factor cost plus some taxes on production, such as \nproperty and payroll taxes, and less some subsidies, such as for labor but \nnot for products. Most economies use constant market price valuation. \nPakistan\u00a0use constant factor costs, while Fiji and Maldives use basic prices.\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is defined as \nGDP at constant prices divided by the population. Data on per capita \ngross national income in US dollar terms (Atlas method) for 2017 are also \nshown, sourced from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators \nonline.

For Kazakhstan, revenue includes transfers from the \nnational fund. Grants are excluded in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Malaysia, \nand Thailand; revenue from disinvestment is included for India; and only \ncurrent revenue is included for Bangladesh.\nTable A9: Central government expenditure (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment expenditure comprises all nonrepayable payments to both \ncurrent and capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts are computed \nas a share of GDP at current prices.

The difference is computed as a share of GDP at current \nprices. Data variation may arise from statistical discrepancy when, \nfor\u00a0example, balancing items for both central and local governments, and \nfrom differences in the concept used in the individual computations of \nrevenue and expenditure as compared with the calculation of the fiscal \nbalance. For\u00a0Fiji, the fiscal balance excludes loan repayment. For\u00a0Georgia, \nfiscal balance is calculated according to the Government Finance \nStatistics Manual 2001 of the IMF.

Global trade and economic activity weakened toward the end of\u00a02018, \nslowing growth in many economies in the region. The outlook is cloudy with risks that tilt to the downside. \nA drawn-out trade conflict could undermine trade and investment in the region, and US fiscal policy \nand the consequences of a disorderly Brexit could weigh on growth in the advanced economies and the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China. Though the risk of sharp increases in US interest rates has subsided, policy\u00a0makers \nmust stay vigilant.\nDisasters are shaped by natural hazards and the dynamics of the economy, society, and environment in which \nthey occur. They pose a growing threat to development and prosperity in the region, their consequences \ndisproportionately severe in developing countries, especially for the poor and marginalized. As developing\u00a0Asia \nis home to more than four-fifths of the people affected by disasters globally in the past 2 decades, the \nregion must strengthen its disaster resilience. This means integrating disaster risk reduction into national  SA\ndevelopment and investment plans, spending more on prevention for a better balance with spending on  trengSIA\nrescue and recovery, and pooling risk through insurance and reinsurance. thN\nen D\ningE\n DV\nisaEL\nAbout the Asian Development Bank ster ROPM\ne\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific,   silieEN ASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nncT\nwhile sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.
