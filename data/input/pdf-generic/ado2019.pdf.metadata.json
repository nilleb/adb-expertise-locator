Global trade and economic activity weakened toward the end of\u00a02018, \nslowing growth in many economies in the region. The outlook is cloudy with risks that tilt to the downside. \nA drawn-out trade conflict could undermine trade and investment in the region, and US fiscal policy \nand the consequences of a disorderly Brexit could weigh on growth in the advanced economies and the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China. Though the risk of sharp increases in US interest rates has subsided, policy\u00a0makers \nmust stay vigilant.\n\nDisasters are shaped by natural hazards and the dynamics of the economy, society, and environment in which \nthey occur. They pose a growing threat to development and prosperity in the region, their consequences \ndisproportionately severe in developing countries, especially for the poor and marginalized. As developing\u00a0Asia \nis home to more than four-fifths of the people affected by disasters globally in the past 2 decades, the \nregion must strengthen its disaster resilience. This means integrating disaster risk reduction into national \ndevelopment and investment plans, spending more on prevention for a better balance with spending on \nrescue and recovery, and pooling risk through insurance and reinsurance.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific,  \nwhile sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

Asia seems to be on a path of moderating growth as a recovery in global \ntrade and economic activity that began in 2017 loses steam. Estimated regional \ngrowth remains robust but slowed in 2018 to 5.9% and is expected to slow further to \n5.7% this year and 5.6% in 2020. Minus the newly industrialized economies, regional \nexpansion at 6.4% in 2018 is envisaged softening to 6.2% this year and 6.1% in 2020. \nAlthough regional inflation crept up slightly to 2.5% last year on rising oil prices and \ncurrency depreciation, it remains well below the 10-year historical average of 3.2%. \nHeadline inflation is forecast to remain at 2.5% in the next 2 years. \n\nPersistent trade tensions continue to weigh on the region and pose the \nbiggest risk to the forecast. Uncertainty over trade can deter consumption \nand investment. Other potential shocks that could buffet the region include a \nsharper slowdown in the advanced economies or the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nFortunately, policy\u00a0makers in the region are vigilant and ready to respond to shocks. \nWhen\u00a0problems in Argentina and Turkey threw some emerging market currency \nexchanges into turmoil last year, many countries in the region gave their exchange \nrates room to move while tightening policy rates as guardrails against large and \ndisruptive currency movements. As a result, currency adjustments were orderly, \nexchange rates eventually stabilized, and many currencies have since recovered. \nThis\u00a0kind of flexibility with vigilance is the necessary response to avoid disaster in \nan uncertain economic environment.\n\nAnother kind of disaster that nations must prepare for are those posed by natural \n\nhazards like cyclones and earthquakes. As documented in the theme chapter from \nwhich this report takes its name, developing Asia suffered from, 2000 to 2018, an \nannual average of nearly 38,000 disaster fatalities. As development patterns and \nclimate change intensify the risks posed by natural hazards, their effects can spread \nacross borders through migration and supply chain links. As a region that routinely \nlives with natural hazards\u2014the home to more than four-fifths of the people affected \nby disasters globally in the past 2 decades\u2014Asia must prioritize strengthening \nits disaster resilience. This can be done in various ways: integrating disaster risk \nreduction into national development and investment plans, spending more on \nprevention for a better balance with spending on response, and pooling risk through \ninsurance and reinsurance, among other strategies.\n\nAsian Development Outlook 2019 proudly marks 30 years as a publication \n\nproviding Asian Development Bank economic analysis, forecasts, and policy advice \ntailored to its developing member countries. We in ADB hope to continue influencing \nthe global discourse toward finding lasting solutions to the challenges we share and \nbuilding resilience that will benefit us all.\n\nTAKEHIKO NAKAO \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nAsian Development Outlook 2019 was prepared by staff of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in the Central and West Asia Department, East Asia Department, \nPacific\u00a0Department, South Asia Department, Southeast Asia Department, \nand Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, as well as in \nADB\u00a0resident missions.

Growth in the region is projected to soften \nto 5.7% in 2019 and 5.6% in 2020. Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income newly \nindustrialized economies, growth is expected to slip from 6.4% in 2018 to 6.2% \nin 2019 and 6.1% in 2020.\n\nAs oil prices rose and Asian currencies depreciated, inflation edged up last year \nbut remained low by historical standards. In light of stable commodity prices, \ninflation is anticipated to remain subdued at 2.5% in both 2019 and 2020.\n\nRisks remain tilted to the downside. A drawn-out or deteriorating trade \nconflict between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the United States \ncould undermine investment and growth in developing Asia. With various \nuncertainties stemming from US fiscal policy and a possible disorderly Brexit, \ngrowth in the advanced economies could turn out slower than expected, \nundermining the outlook for the People\u2019s Republic of China and other \neconomies in the region. Though abrupt increases in US interest rates appear \nto have ceased for the time being, policy makers must remain vigilant in these \nuncertain times.\n\nDisaster risk from natural hazards is a growing threat to the development and \nprosperity in the region, and the consequences tend to be more severe in \ndeveloping countries, affecting poor and marginalized people disproportionally. \nHome to more than four-fifths of the people affected by disasters globally in \nthe past 2 decades, developing Asia must prioritize strengthening its disaster \nresilience. Governments should integrate disaster risk reduction into national \ndevelopment and investment plans. Spending more on prevention would bring \na better balance with spending on response and provide better protection to \npeople at risk. Pooling risk through insurance and reinsurance promises to be \ncost-efficient.\n\nYasuyuki Sawada\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fxii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nChallenges from rising headwinds\n\nGrowth softens as trade tensions persist\n\n(cid:31) Developing Asia posted strong but moderating growth in 2018. Despite \n\nrising headwinds, growth in aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) slowed only \nslightly from 6.2% in 2017 to 5.9% in 2018 as global trade and economic activity \ndecelerated at the end of the year, affecting many economies in the region. \nWith\u00a0growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) continuing to moderate, \nregional growth will soften further to 5.7% in 2019 and to 5.6% in\u00a02020. \nExcluding the newly industrialized economies, growth will slow from 6.4% in \n2018 to 6.2% in 2019 and to 6.1% in 2020.\n\n \u00bb A slowdown from late 2018 will continue in the advanced economies. \n\nAggregate growth in the three major advanced economies\u2014the United\u00a0States, \nthe euro area, and Japan\u2014slowed from 2.3% in 2017 to 2.2% in 2018. \nThe slowing trend will likely reach 1.9% in 2019 and 1.6% in 2020 under \nless accommodative fiscal and monetary policies in the US, uncertainty \nsurrounding Brexit in the United Kingdom and the European Union, and the \ntrade conflict between the PRC and US.\n\n \u00bb PRC moderation reflects structural factors and financial tightening. \n\nWith\u00a0the economy maturing, growth in the PRC slowed from 6.8% in 2017 to \n6.6% in 2018 as the government sought to reduce corporate leveraging and \ncontrol financial risks. Growth will moderate further to 6.3% in 2019 and 6.1% \nin 2020 as restrictions on housing markets and shadow banking continue and \nas the trade conflict with the US weakens exports.\n\n \u00bb India is set to see growth pick up as consumption strengthens. \n\nGrowth\u00a0slowed from 7.2% in fiscal 2017 to 7.0% in 2018, with weaker \nagricultural output and consumption growth curtailed by higher global oil \nprices and lower government expenditure. Growth is expected to rebound \nto 7.2% in 2019 and 7.3% in 2020 as policy rates are cut and farmers receive \nincome support, bolstering domestic demand. \n\n \u00bb Southeast Asia will sustain growth at close to 5% this year and\u00a0next. \n\nStrengthening domestic demand will offset weaker export growth. \nStrong\u00a0consumption\u2014spurred by rising incomes, subdued inflation, and \nrobust remittances\u2014should boost economic activity in the subregion. \nExport\u00a0demand, on the other hand, is likely to soften in 2019 in line with the \nweaker global environment and a muted forecast for semiconductor exports, \nbefore picking up slightly in 2020. \n\n \u00bb Growth will recover in the Pacific but moderate in Central Asia. Growth\u00a0in \nthe Pacific is set to rebound from a meager 0.9% in 2018 to 3.5% in 2019 \nas liquefied natural gas production in Papua New Guinea, the subregion\u2019s \ndominant economy, returns to full capacity following an earthquake in 2018. \nMeanwhile, lower oil prices and slower growth in the Russian Federation will \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xiii\n\nweigh on economies in Central Asia. Growth in the subregion is projected to \ndecelerate to 4.2% in both 2019 and 2020 as slowdowns in Kazakhstan and \nTurkmenistan more than offset higher growth elsewhere.\n\n (cid:31) Financial conditions in Asia tightened in 2018, but have since improved. \n\nJitters over emerging markets sparked by Argentina and Turkey in 2018 caused \nregional currencies to depreciate against the US dollar, with the Indian rupee, \nIndonesian rupiah, and Philippine peso most sharply hit. Partly in response, many \ncentral banks in the region hiked their policy rates during the year. Then a pause \nin the tightening of US monetary policy, and some dissipation of concern about \nAsian emerging markets, allowed many regional currencies and equity markets to \nrecover. Capital flows have stabilized. \n\n (cid:31) Inflation edged up in 2018 but remains low by historical standards. On the \nheels of rising oil prices and currency depreciation, inflation in developing Asia \npicked up slightly from 2.2% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2018. Despite the increase, \ninflation remains well below the 10-year historical average of 3.2% for the region. \nIt is expected to remain subdued in the coming years. With stable commodity \nprices, headline inflation is forecast unchanged at 2.5% in 2019 and 2020.\n\n (cid:31) In a cloudy outlook, risks remain tilted to the downside. The primary risks still \ncenter on the US\u2013PRC trade conflict. Uncertainty is heightened by protracted \nnegotiations and disagreements, which could curtail investment and growth in \nthe region. A possible upside risk to the outlook is that negotiations readily bring \nagreement and lower trade barriers. Beyond the trade conflict, growth in the \nadvanced economies and the PRC may slow by more than expected if Brexit is \ndisorderly, for example, or fiscal policy uncertainty persists in the US. On the \nother hand, the risk from the US abruptly raising the policy rate has subsided \ncompared with 2018, but the risk of financial volatility remains.\n\nExchange rates affect domestic financial conditions \nthrough financial and trade channels\n\n(cid:31) Exchange rate uncertainty may bear on regional financial conditions. \n\nLocal currency depreciation and heightened exchange rate volatility in 2018 \ncould affect borrowing costs for economies in the region. High reliance on \nfunding denominated in US dollars renders countries vulnerable to changing \nglobal financial conditions. Changes to the exchange rate and the sovereign \nbond spread, a measure of domestic financial conditions, closely correlated in \nemerging Asia in 2018. The exchange rate influences financial conditions in \nemerging markets through two competing effects: As a currency depreciates, \nthe trade channel tends to loosen domestic financial conditions by improving \nexternal competitiveness, while the financial channel tends to tighten financial \nconditions by worsening the economy\u2019s balance sheet.\n\n (cid:31) Trade and financial channels both affect domestic financial conditions. \n\nEmpirical analysis of selected economies in emerging Asia shows that changes in \nexchange rates affect sovereign credit risk premiums, which can further influence \n\n\fxiv(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nfinancial conditions through domestic lending rates. Changes to bilateral \nexchange rates against the US dollar affect financial conditions largely through \nthe financial channel, while movements in nominal effective exchange rates act \nvia the trade channel. However, the relative dominance of these two effects \ndepends on circumstances specific to each economy, so policy prescriptions \nshould be tailored individually. \n\n (cid:31) Domestic financial resilience can mitigate adverse external influences. \n\nAn\u00a0appropriate policy mix and regional policy dialogue can strengthen domestic \nfinancial resilience and limit the impact of shocks from external funding \nconditions. Ensuring domestic financial stability is a challenge when external \nfunding conditions are unfavorable. Monetary and macroprudential policies need \nto consider the effects the exchange rate has through both financial and trade \nchannels. More broadly, it is important to cultivate an investor base at home and \ndeepen capital markets in the region, in particular by further developing local \ncurrency bond markets. These policies should go hand in hand with strengthened \npolicy dialogue across borders to monitor macro-financial conditions. Further, \ncapital flow management measures must be considered to mitigate disruptive \nspillover in an increasingly interconnected global financial system. \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xv\n\nOutlook by subregion\n\n(cid:31) Growth will moderate in 2019 across most of developing Asia. Only\u00a020\u00a0of \n45 individual economies are projected to see growth accelerate in\u00a02019. \nBy\u00a0subregion, aggregate growth rates in Central Asia, East Asia, and \nSoutheast\u00a0Asia are expected to decelerate, while South Asia and the Pacific \nwill\u00a0bounce back from slowdown in 2018. South and Southeast Asia will grow \nmore quickly in 2020 than in 2019. \n\n (cid:31) East Asia slows as the global economy and trade weaken. Economic growth in \nEast Asia decelerated by 0.2 percentage points to 6.0% in 2018, weighed down \nby weakening external trade and moderating investment in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) but sustained by resilient domestic consumption. Growth \nmoderated to 6.6% in the PRC as policies to control risk in the financial sector \nand housing market dampened investment. Unique in the subregion, growth in \nMongolia accelerated to 6.9% on large mining investment. Expansion in the PRC \nshould moderate to 6.3% in 2019 and 6.1% in 2020 as global growth slows and \neconomic policy targets a more sustainable growth trajectory. Growth will slow \nin the rest of the subregion as well in tandem with slower expansion in exports. \nEconomic growth in the whole subregion will thus slide to 5.7% in 2019 and \n5.5% in 2020. Inflation edged up last year as food prices and rents rose in most \nsubregional economies. It will trend down from 2.0% in 2018 to 1.8% in 2019 \nand\u00a02020 as oil prices moderate and rents and food prices stabilize.\n\n (cid:31) South Asia bucks the trend of slowing growth in Asia. Growth is expected to \nedge up by 0.1 percentage point, from 6.7% in 2018 to 6.8% in 2019 and again \nto 6.9% in 2020. Subregional averages in South Asia reflect heavy weighting for \nIndia, where growth slipped from 7.2% in 2017 to 7.0% in 2018 as agriculture \nand government expenditure both experienced slower growth and as global \noil prices rose. Growth in India is forecast to pick up a bit to 7.2% in 2019 and \n7.3% in 2020 on recovery in agriculture and stronger domestic demand, with \nreform having strengthened the health of banks and corporations, and as the \nimplementation of a value-added tax makes domestic firms and products more \ncompetitive. Most other countries in South Asia are expected to maintain or \nslightly improve on their high growth rates, with Bangladesh expected to achieve \n8.0% growth in 2019 and 2020. Pakistan and Sri Lanka, however, are currently \nreining in fiscal and external imbalances by implementing a broad range of \neconomic reforms. Inflation in South Asia was stable at 3.7% in 2018 with \nbenign food inflation and despite higher global oil prices. Subregional inflation is \nexpected rise to 4.7% in 2019 and 4.9% in 2020 under pressure from currency \ndepreciation and India\u2019s upward adjustment of some agricultural procurement \nprices to cover higher input costs.\n\n (cid:31) Southeast Asia holds steady with some growth moderation. Subregional \ngrowth was marginally lower at 5.1% last year as strong domestic demand \ncountered slowing exports. With weakening global growth, slowing trade, \nand softer commodity prices, export prospects dim further for these highly \ntrade-engaged economies. Continued strength in domestic demand should \n\n\fxvi(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nnevertheless support growth at 4.9% this year and 5.0% next year. In half \nof the 10 subregional economies, growth is forecast to slow this year, while \nIndonesia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic will be unchanged, and \nBrunei Darussalam, Myanmar, and the Philippines will post higher growth. \nStrong consumption, spurred by rising incomes, stable inflation, and robust \nremittances, is underpinning growth in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand, as is foreign investment in Cambodia and Viet\u00a0Nam \nand large infrastructure projects elsewhere. Inflation in the subregion will dip \nmarginally this year before returning to last year\u2019s 2.7%, broadly held in check by \nslowing growth and lower international oil prices, even as some countries hike \nadministered prices. \n\n (cid:31) Central Asia will slow again after growth picked up in 2018. Average growth \nin the subregion rose from 4.2% in 2017 to 4.4% last year as higher oil prices \nrestored growth to Azerbaijan and expansion accelerated in Tajikistan and \nUzbekistan, the latter reflecting the authorities\u2019 revision of statistics in prior \nyears. Growth remained unchanged in Georgia and Kazakhstan and slowed \nin Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Turkmenistan, the last reflecting fiscal \ntightening. Growth in the subregion is forecast to slow to 4.2% in both 2019 \nand 2020 with lower average oil prices trimming expansion in Kazakhstan, \nand despite improvement in Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nUzbekistan. With tight monetary policy reducing inflation in Kazakhstan and \nparticularly in Azerbaijan, where the exchange rate stabilized, average inflation \nin the subregion fell from 9.0% in 2017 to 7.9%, despite acceleration in Armenia, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Inflation is projected to slow further to 7.8% in \n2019 and 7.2% in 2020 with further tightening of fiscal policy in Turkmenistan \nand monetary policy in Kazakhstan, as well as slower credit growth in Uzbekistan. \n\n (cid:31) The Pacific continues to lag behind other subregions. Low growth at 0.9% in \n\n2018 once again reflected developments in Papua New Guinea, the predominant \neconomy in the subregion, which grew by a mere 0.2% following an earthquake \nin February that hit output of gold and liquefied natural gas. Timor-Leste, the \nthird largest economy in the subregion, contracted for a second successive year \nas political uncertainty continued to hamper government spending. Nauru also \ncontracted because of downsizing at the Regional Processing Centre for asylum \nseekers. With recovery in Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste and continued \ngrowth in the other economies, subregional growth is forecast at 3.5% in 2019 \nand 3.2% in 2020, still the lowest in developing Asia. Inflation eased slightly \nto 4.0% in 2018 as slower price rises in Papua New Guinea and Tonga, the \neconomies with the highest inflation, outweighed significant increases reflecting \nin large part higher fuel prices in several of the remaining economies, notably \nTimor-Leste and Fiji, the second largest economy in the subregion. Inflation \nis expected to slow to 3.7% in 2019 and then bounce back to 4.0% in 2020, \nprimarily reflecting movements in international fuel and food prices.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xvii\n\nStrengthening disaster resilience\n\nSummary\n\n\uf076  Disaster risk and costs are rising, and Asia is particularly vulnerable.\n\n\uf074  Rapid socioeconomic development is converging with worsening threats \nfrom natural hazards to pose unprecedented risk from catastrophes in \ndeveloping Asia. \n\n\uf074  While the direct, immediate impacts of disasters tend to be local and short \nterm, new evidence presented in this report shows how these effects can \nspill over to other places and last for a lifetime.\n\n\uf074  Suitable policy interventions are required to keep disaster losses from \n\nspiraling into the future and across the region.\n\n\uf076  Disaster risk management has improved, but gaps remain.\n\n\uf074  Governments should continue to integrate disaster risk reduction \n\ninto broader development policies and public investment strategies. \nThey\u00a0can\u00a0build resilience from the ground up by facilitating climate \nchange adaptation through enhanced disaster-resilient infrastructure, \nsupporting the development of market mechanisms, and investing directly \nin communities. \n\n\uf074  Asia has led progress on these fronts in recent years, but positive trends \nneed reinforcement. Spending on disaster prevention continues to lag far \nbehind disaster response. Access to credit, insurance, and remittances \nremains sparse and uneven, limiting the coping strategies available to \nhouseholds affected by disasters. Immediate humanitarian response \ncould be better coordinated with subsequent interventions for long-term \nrecovery.\n\n\uf076  Managing disaster risk can enhance equity, resilience, and sustainability. \n\nA greater focus on strengthening disaster resilience and preparing for \nrecovery can ensure that rebuilding in the wake of disasters\u2014building back \nbetter\u2014emphasizes safety, timeliness, social equity, and the full realization of \neconomic potential.\n\nNatural hazards putting Asia\u2019s prosperity at risk\n\n(cid:31) Disasters are worse when vulnerable populations are exposed to hazards.\nThe upshot is harm to people and their physical assets such as property and \ninfrastructure. Hazards can be natural, like hurricanes and earthquakes, or \nman-made, like industrial accidents and nuclear meltdowns. This report focuses \non disasters that emerge from natural hazards, including severe weather events, \ngeophysical disturbances, and epidemics. They can occur suddenly with little \nor no warning, or they can build slowly over the span of days, weeks, months, \nor\u00a0years.\n\n\fxviii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n(cid:31) Development and climate change alter disaster risk. On the one hand, rising \nincomes enable communities to cope with disasters. On the other, rapidly \nexpanding coastal megacities, for example, create greater exposure to natural \nhazards. As the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events worsen \nbecause of climate change and associated sea level rise, coastal areas and island \nstates across Asia face increasingly dire threats. \n\n (cid:31) More than four in five people affected by natural hazards live in Asia. \nFrom\u00a02000 to 2018, developing Asia was home to 84% of the 206 million \npeople affected by disasters globally on average each year. With nearly 38,000 \ndisaster fatalities annually in that period, the region accounted for almost 55% \nof 60,000 disaster fatalities worldwide, and it suffered 26% of the $128 billion \nin economic damage. In Asia, 82% of disasters ensued from extreme weather \nevents such as floods, storms, and droughts.\n\n (cid:31) Those who suffer most are poor, marginalized, and isolated. Surveys after \nsevere flooding in Indian cities found that poor and migrant families were the \nworst affected, with some losing more than they earned in a year. Many small \nbusinesses fell into financial distress, some having to sell their assets and close \ndown. Further, surveys of communities heavily exposed to flooding across five \nAsian countries found that, among rural households surveyed, 90% had suffered \nin the past decade either loss of life or significant damage to assets from floods, \nand their financial recovery took more than three times longer than for urban \nhouseholds. Pacific island economies are especially vulnerable to severe hazards, \nreflecting their isolation, limited economic diversification, and extreme exposure.\n\nDisaster impacts and how they propagate\n\n(cid:31) Immediate impacts on local economic activity can be substantial. New \n\nevidence on the economic impacts of tropical storms in the Philippines shows \nthat each of these events reduced local economic activity in that year by 1.7% \non average but by as much as 23% after the most severe storms. More extreme \nevents can have much larger impacts. Cyclone Pam in 2015\u2014the second most \nintense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the South Pacific\u2014caused damage \nin Vanuatu equal to 64% of annual GDP. Events that fall short of catastrophic \ntypically affect economic activity for a year or less, allowing households that \ntemporarily migrate away in the aftermath of a disaster to return to their land \nand livelihoods.\n\n (cid:31) Beyond immediate loss of life and wealth, effects can persist over time. \nMore than a decade after the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan, for example, \nincome per capita in Hyogo Prefecture was 12% lower than it otherwise would \nhave been. Case studies of flooding in Indian cities show that, in the absence \nof social protection, disaster-hit families deplete their savings or borrow at \nhigh interest rates from informal sources, pushing them into indebtedness \nand poverty traps. Recent research reveals that disasters can affect victims for \ndecades as reduced household spending on food, medicine, and education, \nfor\u00a0example, stunts a child\u2019s potential well into adulthood. \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xix\n\n(cid:31) Effects can spread and link up with epidemics, conflict, and other risks.\nDisruption to supply chains, as occurred in 2011 after floods in Thailand and \nthe Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, can transmit disaster impacts to \nfirms and customers not directly hit by the event. Spatial transmission of impacts \nhappens as well when people are forced to leave a stricken area, creating a \ndisplaced population. East, Southeast, and South Asia accounted for over 60% \nof the estimated 19 million people displaced by disasters in 2017\u2014some briefly, \nothers for much longer. The number of internal climate migrants is projected to \nincrease rapidly. Disaster-induced migration can expose migrants to flooding, \nlandslides, heat stress, and other hazards. It may also facilitate the spread of \ndisease and even spark social disorder in urban areas, as suggested by new \nevidence on flood-induced migration.\n\nInvesting in development with disaster resilience\n\n(cid:31) Asia has achieved substantial mainstreaming of disaster risk management. \nMany countries in the region are adapting the Sendai Framework for Disaster \nRisk Reduction, 2015\u20132030 for national needs and thereby effecting a notable \npolicy shift in disaster response from reactive to proactive. Escalating losses from \ndisasters suggest that these positive trends require reinforcement to translate \nplans into actions and to address the causes of social vulnerability and the \ndrivers of disaster risk.\n\n (cid:31) Greenfield investment is a natural entry point for disaster resilience. \n\nDeveloping Asia is estimated to need $26 trillion in infrastructure \ninvestment\u00a0from 2016 to 2030, or $1.7 trillion per year. Planning for and \ninvesting in climate-friendly and disaster-resilient infrastructure from the start \ncan help avoid locking\u00a0in further exposure to disaster risk and is a particularly \ncost-effective way to reduce future losses from disasters. \n\n (cid:31) Spending on prevention needs to catch up with spending on response. \nGlobally, governments in developing countries receive seven times more \nassistance for responding to disasters after they occur than for preparing \nin advance for rapid recovery and, where possible, taking measures to \nkeep hazards from developing into disasters. In Asia, this spending gap has \nnarrowed slightly over the past few years but remains large. Further closing \nthe gap will yield multiple dividends, especially when investments have \ndevelopment benefits aside from reducing disaster risk. Examples include \nstable water resource management that integrates flood risk considerations, \nthe construction of cyclone-safe multipurpose evacuation centers that serve \ndaily as classrooms or community centers, the reestablishment of sustainable \nmangrove forests to absorb storm impacts and prevent coastal erosion, or \nhydroponic projects that diversify incomes in normal times and safeguard food \nsecurity when disaster strikes.\n\n (cid:31) Risk shared through commercial credit or insurance is manageable risk. \n\nAcross Asia including Japan, just over 8% of catastrophe losses since 1980 were \ncovered by insurance. Recent years have seen an increase in programs that offer \ninsurance coverage, especially across developing Asia. New studies show that \n\n\fxx(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\ntwo-thirds of them offer micro-insurance to cover agriculture losses, and over \n80% depend on subsidies or other financial support. The benefits of insurance \nare clear: pooling risk to preserve human welfare, facilitating investment \nby containing risk, and making post-disaster support more predictable. \nWhile\u00a0traditional indemnity insurance models are difficult to scale down to the \nneeds of individual households in poor communities, more innovative insurance \nmodels such as index-based risk-transfer products (such as drought insurance \nlinked to rainfall) offer potential, and government and international support for \nreinsurance allows broader pooling of risk. \n\n (cid:31) Hiring victims can help, as can informal support networks and remittances. \nLabor market interventions can gainfully employ some disaster-affected people \nin reconstruction after disasters. Informal risk-sharing arrangements such as \nthrough private transfers within communities can effectively cope with shocks \nto individual households but not with shocks to whole communities from \nlarge disasters. Public transfers can help, as can remittances from outside the \naffected\u00a0area. In the Philippines, for example, remittances compensated for \nnearly 65% of income lost in shocks caused by rainfall deviation. The poorest of \nthe poor, however, often lack the social and financial networks necessary to allow \nfamily members to migrate and remit.\n\n (cid:31) Community action must complement national efforts. Communities are \n\nthemselves the first responders to disasters, often with little or no immediate \nexternal support, and are key to ensuring sustained recovery and reconstruction. \nNew evidence from flood resilience surveys across 88 communities in Asia \nshows that community investments can build resilience while delivering \nbroader development benefits, such as better education, transportation, and \nfood supply. Proper waste management, for example, can prevent the spread \nof disease and keep rivers and drains clear to carry away floodwaters, while \nbenefiting communities more broadly day to day. Recent experience after major \nearthquakes and tropical cyclones in Asia highlights the role of local communities \nas custodians of local knowledge and experience that enables the dissemination \nof early warning messages and timely evacuation, and that can guide the \neffective delivery of humanitarian response and recovery assistance.\n\n (cid:31) Development agencies support disaster resilience in many ways. Countries \nhave received concessional loans and grants from development agencies to \nstrengthen disaster resilience. Multilateral and regional lenders support the \nestablishment of disaster-contingent financing arrangements designed for \nquick disbursement. An ADB $6 million contingent financing loan to Tonga, \nfor\u00a0example, was fully disbursed in just 3 days after that Pacific island country \nwas struck by Tropical Cyclone Gita in February 2018. Other multilateral \nassistance from ADB has designed and piloted innovative insurance programs, \nnotably a disaster insurance pool for city governments in the Philippines that \nwas a world first. Meanwhile, international efforts continue to provide to poor \ncountries access to finance through more traditional emergency assistance loans \nand grants offered in response to disasters.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xxi\n\n(cid:31) Enhanced financial arrangements enable better disaster management.\nDelayed or insufficient financing for relief, early recovery, or reconstruction \nexacerbates the economic and social consequences of direct physical damage, \nextending the time required to rebuild infrastructure, render it fully functional, \nand deliver the services that depend on it. Such shortcomings stymie efforts \nto build back better. Governments increasingly recognize this and work to \nenhance both sovereign and nonsovereign financing instruments with support \nfrom development partners. The Government of the Philippines became the \nfirst to position these instruments in a wider framework by establishing in 2015 \na national financing strategy for disaster risk to promote a comprehensive \napproach. The Government of Indonesia launched a similar strategy in 2018, and \nsuch strategies are currently under development in Myanmar and Pakistan. \n\nPrepared to build back better after a disaster\n\n(cid:31) Humanitarian response is a prelude to recovery and reconstruction.\n\nSustainable recovery must overcome operational challenges and bridge the \ngap between urgent humanitarian response and longer-term recovery and \nreconstruction. The efficient and equitable allocation of private and public \nresources in response to disasters is often challenged by deficiencies in \ngovernance. Even after finances are secured, reconstruction projects face local \nimplementation challenges such as a lack of skilled personnel, unclear land \ntenure, transportation bottlenecks, and sudden increases in wage rates and \nprices for construction materials. Case studies of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal \nand Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu the same year indicate that successful long-term \nrecovery requires broad collaboration involving central and local governments, \ncivil society, and affected communities. The roles and responsibilities of all \nstakeholders must be clear, and responsible parties must have the experiential \nknowledge and capacity necessary to absorb and effectively apply the large \ninfluxes of resources that materialize after disasters.\n\n (cid:31) Build back better to equitably realize social and economic potential. \n\nBuilding back better means ensuring that recovery is not only complete but \nsuperior to the status quo before the disaster. While building back fast often \ntakes precedence in the immediate aftermath, it must be balanced against other \nobjectives. Strengthening resilience under future hazards should be central to \nrecovery and reconstruction. Crucially, this entails integrating measures that \nmitigate disaster risk when restoring infrastructure and social capital, as well as \nensuring that reconstruction restores and renews economic opportunity and \ndynamism. Finally, public planning for recovery and building back better must be \ninclusive and fair to vulnerable segments of society.\n\n\fxxii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nGDP growth rate and inflation, % per year\n\nCentral Asia\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz Republic\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEast Asia\nHong Kong, China\nMongolia\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRepublic of Korea\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nBrunei Darussalam\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

The region\u2019s two largest economies, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India, both saw growth \ndip slightly to still-robust rates thanks to strong consumption \ngrowth. Inflation in the region edged up from 2.2% in 2017 \nto 2.5% on rising food and oil prices but remained low by \nhistorical norms. Trade growth remained strong in the first \nhalf of 2018 but slowed toward year-end as global economic \nactivity softened and trade tensions between the United States \nand the PRC escalated (Figure\u00a01.0.1). \n\nThe outlook for developing Asia is for continued \n\ndeceleration. The region is expected to grow by 5.7% in 2019 \nand 5.6% in 2020 (Figure 1.0.2). Growth in the PRC is expected \nto continue moderating to 6.3% in 2019 and 6.1% in 2020 as \nthe economy matures and as measures to control financial \nrisks are maintained. In India, growth is expected to pick up \nto 7.2% and 7.3% in response to more accommodative policies. \nFor\u00a0most\u00a0subregions except the Pacific, growth is expected to \nstay flat or decline slightly.\n\nThe main risk to the outlook is still the ongoing trade \n\nconflict, as heightened trade policy uncertainty can \nnegatively affect investment and manufacturing activity. \nA\u00a0sharper slowdown in the advanced economies or the PRC \nis another\u00a0risk. A rapid hike in the US policy rate is now less \nlikely. But\u00a0the risk of financial volatility remains, and this \ncan affect domestic financial conditions. In sum, persistent \nheadwinds that slowed growth in 2018 will continue to shape \nthe region\u2019s economic performance in 2019 and 2020.\n\n1.0.1\u2002Global activity indicators\n\nWorld trade weakened in 2018 as global economic activity slowed \nand trade tensions between the US and the PRC escalated. \n\nGlobal composite PMI, sa\nGlobal manufacturing PMI, sa\n\nWorld trade volume\n\nPoint difference from 50 \n\n% change year on year\n\nTrade tensions\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\nJul \n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nPMI = purchasing managers\u2019 index, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, \nsa = seasonally adjusted, US = United States.\nSources: CEIC Data Company; CPB\u00a0Netherlands Bureau for \nEconomic Policy Analysis. https://www.cpb.nl/en/worldtrademonitor \n(both\u00a0accessed 8\u00a0March 2019).\n\n1.0.2\u2002GDP growth outlook in developing Asia\n\nThe growth outlook for the next 2 years is continued \ndeceleration, with\u00a0the PRC moderating to a more sustainable \ngrowth rate while growth in India picks up in the next 2 years. \n\nDeveloping Asia\nDeveloping Asia\nexcluding NIEs\n\nIndia\nPRC\nMajor industrial economies\n\n6.8\n\n6.4\n\n6.6\n\n6.0\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n6.6\n\n6.2\n\n6.4\n\n5.9\n\n6.2\n\n5.7\n\n6.1\n\n5.6\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\nJan\n2016\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nThis chapter was written by Valerie Mercer-Blackman, Sameer Khatiwada, \nAbdul Abiad, Shiela Camingue-Romance, Junkyu Lee, Arief Ramayandi, \nPeter Rosenkranz, Benno Ferrarini, Madhavi Pundit, Nedelyn Magtibay-\nRamos, Pilipinas Quising, Dennis Sorino, Michael Timbang, and \nPriscille\u00a0Villanueva of the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.

This slowdown occurred in tandem \nwith a slowdown in the major industrial economies of the \nUS, the euro area, and Japan, where composite growth \nmoderated slightly from 2.3% in 2017 to 2.2%. Expansion in \nthe two largest economies in developing Asia decelerated, \nwith growth in the PRC declining from 6.8% in 2017 to \n6.6% in 2018 and in India from 7.2% to 7.0%. Excluding the \nnewly industrialized economies (NIEs), GDP growth in 2018 \nwas down from 6.6% in 2017 to 6.4%. Growth decelerated \nin 28\u00a0economies in the region, or 62% of them, and \naccelerated in\u00a014, or 31%, with Bangladesh leading the pack \nas growth at 7.3% in 2017 accelerated to 7.9%. Solid growth \nmomentum in the first 3 quarters of 2018 started to fade in \nthe last few months, the weakness most evident in exports \n(Figure\u00a01.1.1A). This trend was clearest in the PRC, the NIEs, \nand five larger economies in the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN-5). Growth in industrial production \nalso showed some signs of weakening (Figure 1.1.1B).\n\nKey drivers of growth \nMuch of the impetus for growth in 2018 on the demand\u00a0side \ncame from consumption, while export growth slowed. \nOn\u00a0average, the consumption contribution to growth rose \nfrom 3.4\u00a0percentage points in 2017 to 3.7 points in 2018 \n(Figure 1.1.2). Net exports subtracted from GDP growth in \n7\u00a0of the 11\u00a0larger economies in the sample, reflecting slowing \nexport growth as the external environment weakened, \nas\u00a0well as rising imports with higher oil prices.\n\nInvestment spurred growth in some economies but \ndragged on growth in others. In 2018, the contribution \nof investment to growth picked up in Indonesia; the \nPhilippines; Taipei,China; and Thailand (Figure\u00a01.1.3). \nThis\u00a0reflected increased public investment as \ngovernments launched initiatives for infrastructure and \nnew technology, as well as private investment funded \nby foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in \nIndonesia and Thailand (Section 1.1.6). Meanwhile, the \ncontribution to growth from investment declined notably \nin Malaysia, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Singapore. \n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201330\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\nJan\n2015\n\n1.1.1\u2002 Growth in exports and industrial production, \n\nselected economies\n\nExport growth in developing Asia was strong in 2017 and \nmost\u00a0of 2018 but lost momentum in the last months of 2018\u2026\n\nA.

Consumer confidence \ndeclined through most of 2018 in the PRC, the ROK, and \nTaipei,China (Figure 1.1.4A).

Small and medium-sized \nenterprises, which account for a large part of this sector, may \nhave struggled to comply with new regulations under the goods \nand services tax (GST), undermining the sector\u2019s performance. \nIn\u00a0contrast, growth in industry sharply increased to 7.7% in \nFY2018, owing to strong manufacturing, construction, and utilities. \n\nOn the demand side, private consumption was the main \ndriver of India\u2019s growth in FY2018. It grew by 8.3%, the highest \nrate in 7 years, despite rural consumption remaining sluggish \nunder subdued crop prices, slow growth in rural wages, and \nstress on nonbank lenders. Consumption is likely to have \nreceived impetus from reduced GST rates across a wide range of \ncommodities during the year and a cut in key monetary policy \nrates. Government consumption slowed, as expected, because of \ntightened finances. Gross fixed capital formation grew by a robust \n10% in FY2018, sustained by 20.3% growth in central government \ncapital expenditure as investment in roads, railways, and urban \ninfrastructure remained strong. Private\u00a0investment is estimated \nto have increased a bit, reflecting a pickup in lending to industry, \nan uptick in capacity utilization, and increased production of \ncapital\u00a0goods.\n\nThe PRC saw growth slow from 6.8% in 2017 to 6.6% in 2018, \n\nin line with the government\u2019s growth target of around 6.5%. \nGrowth moderation is partly structural as the PRC\u00a0economy \nmatures.

But the contribution \nof investment to growth slipped, as local governments tightly \ncontrolled expenditure, both on budget and off budget, in the \nfirst 9 months of 2018. Growth in infrastructure investment \nplummeted from 19.0% in 2017 to 3.8% in 2018. Exports\u00a0rose \nin the PRC partly because shipments were frontloaded ahead \nof the imposition of tariffs, but growth in merchandise \nimports accelerated even more, so that net exports subtracted \n0.6\u00a0percentage points from growth. \n\nIndia\nPRC\n\nIndex\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\nOn the supply side, services remained the main driver \nof PRC growth, despite slowing from 7.9% growth in 2017 \nto 7.6% last year. Growth was strong in transport, in leasing \nand commercial services, and in information technology \nservices, while financial and real estate services remained \nweak. Growth of industry including construction and \nmining moderated marginally from 5.9% in 2017 to 5.8% in \n2018. Strong increases in consumer, high-tech, and export-oriented \nmanufacturing partly offset deceleration in mining and raw \nmaterials, where retrenchment targets reined in production.\n\nThe PMI, which is a forward-looking indicator of health in \nmanufacturing, suggests the trajectories of the two\u00a0economies may \nbe diverging (Figure 1.1.7). The most recent data for India indicate \nthat India\u2019s PMI surged to a 14-month high of 54.3 in February \n2019, distinguishing it from the rest of developing\u00a0Asia (Table 1.1.1). \nIn\u00a0the PRC, by contrast, the PMI declined for much of 2018, as \nexport growth slowed, to reach its lowest reading in 34 months, \nthough still averaging 50.7 in the whole of 2018, slightly above \nthe\u00a0threshold at\u00a050\u00a0indicating expansion. \n\nTighter monetary policy in response \nto\u00a0currency depreciation \nMany currencies in developing Asia depreciated against the US \ndollar in 2018. This reflected a steady increase in the federal funds \nrate set by the US Federal Reserve and jitters in emerging markets \ncaused by problems in Argentina and Turkey. Currencies that \nexperienced especially deep depreciation against the US dollar \nwere the Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah, and Philippine peso \n(Figure\u00a01.1.8).

The instability, \ndriven by the US Federal Reserve\u2019s repeated interest \nrate hikes, raised concerns about broader risk aversion \ntoward emerging markets. In recent months, a measure \nof stability has returned to emerging markets, but it \nremains unclear how long the calm will last.\n\nEmerging market currencies on the rebound\nThe Turkish lira and Argentine peso have both \nstabilized since the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2018. \nForceful interest rate hikes by the Central Bank of \nTurkey seem to have restored investor confidence \nin that economy. In Argentina, expansion and \nacceleration of an International Monetary Fund \nloan package and the government\u2019s commitment to \nfiscal consolidation arrested the peso\u2019s fall. Despite \nclear improvement in investor sentiment toward \nboth economies, they still suffer under substantial \nmacroeconomic imbalances and remain vulnerable to \nshocks.\u00a0In line with the stabilization of the lira and \npeso, the currencies of emerging markets as a whole \nhave performed noticeably better since Q4 of 2018 \n(box figure 1). Broadly speaking, emerging market \ncurrencies fell sharply during Q2 of 2018, bottomed \nout in Q3, and rebounded in Q4. To a\u00a0large\u00a0extent, \naccording to the International Institute of Finance, \ndepreciation reflected correction of exchange \nrate misalignment that prevailed at the beginning \nof the\u00a0year. Since misalignment has been largely \ncorrected, emerging market currencies are now \nshowing greater\u00a0stability.\n\n1\u2002 MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index\n\nIndex\n\n1,750\n\n1,700\n\n1,650\n\n1,600\n\n1,550\n\nJan\n2018\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n2019\n\nMar\n\nMSCI = Morgan Stanley Capital International.\nNotes: MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index measures the total return of 25 \nemerging market currencies relative to the US dollar where the weight of each \ncurrency is equal to its country weight in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. \nData are from 1 January 2018 to 1 March 2019.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 2 March 2019).\n\n2\u2002 Indian rupee and\u00a0Indonesian rupiah versus the US dollar\n\nIndonesian rupiah\n\nIndian rupee\n\n\u20b9/$\n\n80\n\n76\n\n72\n\n68\n\n64\n\n60\n\nJan\n2018\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n2019\n\nMar\n\nNote: Data are from 1 January 2018 to 1 March 2019.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 2 March 2019).\n\nEmerging Asian currencies recover as well\nRelatively strong fundamentals are giving a fillip \nto emerging market currencies. Emerging Asian \neconomies in particular enjoy relatively healthy \nfundamentals and are thus well positioned to \nwithstand shocks. For example, inflation is below \n4% in the two major Asian markets that came under \nthe most pressure during emerging market currency \nturmoil in 2018: India and Indonesia. The same two \neconomies also suffered the most volatility during \nthe \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d of 2013. In line with broader \nrecovery of emerging market currencies, both the \nIndian rupee and Indonesian rupiah rebounded \nsince Q4 of 2018 (box figure 2). Although India and \nIndonesia are still burdened with twin deficits in their \nfiscal and current accounts, the magnitude of these \ndeficits is manageable. In addition to relatively strong \nfundamentals, the two economies have benefited from \ndecisive policy action to stabilize financial markets. \nThe Reserve Bank of India and Bank Indonesia each \naggressively hiked their benchmark interest rates in \nQ2\u00a0and Q3 of 2018 to defend their currencies and \nstave\u00a0off inflationary pressures. \n\nFragile but improving outlook for  \nfinancial stability in developing Asia\nNotwithstanding a notable trend toward more \nstable emerging market exchange rates since Q4 of \n2018, global financial markets remain febrile and \nvulnerable to shocks. Global trade tensions, especially \ntensions between the PRC and the US, the world\u2019s \ntwo biggest economies, have not yet been resolved, \ncasting a shadow over the global economic outlook \n\ncontinued next page\n\n\f450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n1.1.1\u2002Continued\n\nand financial\u00a0stability. Although the effects of trade \ntensions seem to be limited so far, their persistence \ncreates uncertainty and thus may yet harm economic \ngrowth. Uncertainty over trade and more generally \nglobal growth prospects contributed to severe volatility \nin the US stock market in December. Risk aversion \ntoward emerging markets is therefore likely to \nremain elevated. As noted above, the most vulnerable \nemerging markets still suffer from imbalances. \nLingering vulnerability helps explain why emerging \nmarket credit spreads remain elevated even though \nthey are trending down (box figure 3).\n\nTherefore, in light of the heightened uncertainty \nsurrounding global growth prospects partly because \nof the unsettled status of the US\u2013PRC trade conflict, \nand considering the unsettling effect this is having \non global financial markets, it is premature to say \nthat emerging markets are completely out of the \nwoods. Furthermore, going forward, there is a great \ndeal of uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of \nUS\u00a0monetary policy, which may destabilize emerging-\nmarket exchange rates (Box 1.1.5). Nevertheless, on \nbalance, the foreign exchange markets of emerging \neconomies, including those in Asia, are unlikely to be \nas volatile in 2019 as they were in 2018. One reason for \nconfidence is that the most vulnerable economies have \nimplemented various measures to promote financial \nstability, including fiscal consolidation and monetary \ntightening. The stabilizing effects of such confidence-\nbuilding measures will persist into the near future. \n\nChallenges from rising headwinds(cid:30)(cid:30)13\n\n3\u2002Emerging markets sovereign bond spreads\n\nEMBIG spread, basis points\n\nJan\n2018\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n2019\n\nMar\n\nEMBIG = Emerging Markets Bond Index Global.\nNotes: EMBIG is JP Morgan\u2019s index of US dollar-denominated sovereign \nbonds.

Despite\u00a0their\u00a0high trade \ndependence, many East and Southeast Asian countries have \nreached a stage of development where household consumption \ncan be a stable and leading driver of growth (Figure 1.1.2).\nMuch of the expected slowdown in regional growth \n\nin\u00a02019 reflects growth moderation in the PRC. The downward \ntrend in GDP growth is expected to persist as uncertainties \npertaining to trade tensions with the US continue to weigh on \nconsumption, investment, and trade. Growth in the PRC should \nslow to 6.3% in 2019 and moderate further to a more sustainable \n6.1% in 2020, reflecting ongoing efforts to contain risks in \nthe financial sector. Fiscal policy should remain supportive \nthrough greater social expenditure, targeted programs to \nsupport employment, and lower value-added tax rates for \nmanufacturers, transportation firms, and utilities, among \nothers. On the demand side, private consumption will remain \nthe main driver of growth, but less so as growth in household \nincome slows. Relaxed real estate restrictions expected \nin\u00a02019, and continued industrial upgrading, should help keep \ninvestment in manufacturing growing but at a slower pace, \nowing to declining profits in manufacturing and less dynamic \nexternal trade. Accommodative\u00a0PRC monetary policy so far \nin\u00a02019 will continue, aiming to prevent any sharp deceleration \nin growth, even if the tradeoff is a lower growth rate than \nin\u00a02018. While\u00a0restrictions on shadow bank financing\u2014the \nmain alternative financing vehicle for small and medium-sized \nenterprises\u2014are expected to continue through 2019 and 2020, \nthey may be relaxed to allow a more gradual reduction in the \nvolume of outstanding shadow credit. \n\n\fChallenges from rising headwinds(cid:30)(cid:30)19\n\nIn India, growth is poised to pick up over the outlook \nperiod, as South Asia\u2019s largest economy is less exposed than \nother Asian economies to the slowdown in manufacturing trade. \nGrowth\u00a0is projected to step up from 7.0% in 2018 to 7.2% in 2019 \nand 7.3% in 2020, with domestic demand still the main driver. \nRural income and consumption will enjoy policy boosts from \nenhanced income support to farmers and hikes in procurement \nprices for food grains, while interest rate cuts and soft food and \nfuel prices will bolster consumption in urban areas. Consumer \nsentiment will remain strong, and private sector investment \nwill likely grow at a healthy pace, as business surveys indicate \nupbeat trends in confidence and credit availability. Net exports \nare expected to drag less on growth as lower oil and commodity \nprices restrain import growth and a more competitive exchange \nrate helps exports. \n\nGrowth in the higher-income economies of East Asia and \nlarge Southeast Asian economies will slow in 2019 in tandem \nwith slower growth in the PRC and lower trade in manufactures. \nSemiconductor producers and users with large high-tech \nmanufacturing bases\u2014such as Malaysia; the ROK; Singapore; \nTaipei,China; and Viet Nam\u2014already saw exports drop in late \n2018 and early 2019 after some frontloading of sales ahead of \ntariff increases in 2018. All these countries are fully engaged \nin electronics value chains and are large suppliers to high-tech \ncompanies in both the PRC and the US. Private\u00a0investment is \nalso in a lull as firms await the resolution of trade negotiations \nthat directly affect their exports. Growth\u00a0in East Asia including \nthe PRC will step down from 6.0% in 2018 to 5.7% in 2019 and \n5.5% in 2020. \n\nIn Southeast Asia as a whole, growth is expected to \n\nmoderate slightly as external demand falls a little more quickly \nthan domestic demand grows. Some economies will pick\u00a0up in \n2020, while others see continued growth moderation. Growth\u00a0is \nprojected to dip from 5.1% in 2018 to 4.9% in 2019, recovering to \n5.0% in 2020. A downturn in the global electronics trade cycle, \nand a slowdown in world trade more generally, will dampen the \ninvestment and export prospects of this highly open subregion \nin 2019\u2014though investment approvals and FDI figures in late \n2018 in Malaysia and Viet\u00a0Nam suggest that investment will \npick up later in the outlook period as uncertainty is resolved. \nBusiness surveys show plans heavily affected by uncertainty, \nboth domestic and external, while purchasing managers\u2019 indexes \nin the main ASEAN economies have been generally falling since \nmid-2018 (Table\u00a01.1.1). Even\u00a0as\u00a0external demand softens, strength \nin domestic demand should provide some cushion to subregional \ngrowth both this year and\u00a0next. \n\nAccelerating domestic investment and buoyant consumption \n\nwill boost growth in the Philippines in 2019 and in Indonesia \nboth this year and next. Growth will strengthen on improved \nprospects for tourism and FDI in Myanmar and as oil refineries \n\n\f20(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\ncome back online in Brunei Darussalam. Viet Nam and Thailand \nshould see growth stabilize in 2020, and Malaysia should see \na pickup as investment and resulting exports regain strength \nwith intermediate trade redirected from the tariff-affected PRC \nand US, as well as from continued strong domestic demand. \nIn Singapore, a more mature economy, growth in private \nconsumption may have already reached its peak. The remaining \nsmaller Southeast Asian economies will continue to grow at rates \nof 6%\u20137% in 2019 and 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, growth will rebound in South Asia and the \nPacific and, with lower external demand, moderate only slightly \nin Central Asia. South Asia will remain the fastest-growing \nsubregion in the world, projected to grow by 6.8% in 2019 \nand 6.9% in 2020, led by Bangladesh at 8.0% in both years. \nIn\u00a0contrast, Pakistan\u2019s outlook is for a sharp drop in growth as, \nfollowing a pronounced widening of its balance of payments \ndeficit in 2018, it likely embarks on austerity measures supported \nby the International Monetary Fund. Some\u00a0oil-exporting \nCentral Asian countries will see a small drop in growth from \n4.4% in 2018 to 4.2% in 2019 and 2020 as oil prices moderate. \nSluggish growth in the Russian Federation will limit the rise in \nincome from remittances in the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, \nand Uzbekistan. Country-specific factors will have effects, \nwith higher natural gas production boosting growth slightly in \nAzerbaijan and a recovery in gold production doing the same in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, offsetting slowing factors in Uzbekistan. \nCurrency woes in\u00a02018 in neighboring Turkey spilled over into \nCentral\u00a0Asia, particularly Azerbaijan and Georgia, where strong \neconomic links with the troubled regional power are calculated \nto have shaved about\u00a00.6\u00a0percentage points off GDP (Box\u00a01.1.2). \nBy\u00a0contrast,\u00a0growth in the Pacific is expected to recover\u00a0from \nnear stagnation at 0.9% in 2018 to 3.5% growth in 2019. This is \nlargely the result of liquefied natural gas facilities coming back \nonline in Papua New Guinea after suffering earthquake damage in \n2018. Growth in the Pacific is forecast to ease to 3.2% in 2020.\n\nIn\ufb02ation will remain low and stable\nHeadline inflation in developing Asia is forecast unchanged at \n2.5% in 2019 and 2020, assuming that commodity prices stabilize. \nBrent crude oil prices are projected to fall from an average of \n$71/barrel in 2018 to $62/barrel in 2019 and\u00a02020. This will \nkeep energy-related inflation under control. Moreover, fuel \nsubsidies in many larger economies will dampen pass-through \neffects. Price changes for other commodities in developing\u00a0Asia\u2014\nsuch\u00a0as copper, steel, natural gas, timber, and palm oil\u2014are \nexported mainly to markets outside of developing\u00a0Asia, so they \ngenerally have little impact on inflation in the region, but they \nhave important direct effects on export growth in exporting \ncountries.

Turkey\u2019s \neconomic presence is felt in the Balkans, the \nMiddle\u00a0East, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and other \nregions. Among ADB developing member countries, \nthe three Caucasus republics and the five Central \nAsian republics enjoy the closest historical, cultural, \nand economic links with Turkey.

It is an especially \nimportant export market for Azerbaijan, receiving \n12% of its exports, and for Tajikistan, receiving 30%. \nMeanwhile, Georgia has the highest share of imports \nfrom Turkey, valued at the equivalent of 9% of GDP, \nand relies heavily on Turkey for machinery, chemicals, \nand metals. Azerbaijan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nTurkmenistan also import substantially from Turkey, \namounts equal to about 3% of their GDP. Since 2003, \nabout 37% of Turkish FDI in Central Asia went to \nAzerbaijan, while another 54% went to Georgia, \nKazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. Azerbaijan is the main \nCentral Asian investor in Turkey, providing 95% of FDI \nfrom the subregion into Turkey since 2003. \n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n\u201360\n\n\u201390\n\nChallenges from rising headwinds(cid:30)(cid:30)21\n\nTurkey has served in the past as an engine of \ngrowth for most countries in Central Asia. However, \nin recent years, growth in Turkey has slowed. \nFurther,\u00a0in 2018, Turkey suffered severe financial \nstress from country-specific factors and from interest \nrate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. At one point, \nthe Turkish lira lost more than half its value against \nthe US dollar, and inflation reached 25%, its highest \nin 15 years. Although\u00a0decisive monetary tightening \nby the Central Bank of Turkey restored a measure \nof financial stability in Q4 of 2018, growth remains \nsubdued. It\u00a0slowed sharply from 7.4% in 2017 to \nonly 2.6% in 2018 because of monetary tightening, \nfiscal consolidation, and weak domestic demand. \nAlthough\u00a0Turkey\u2019s financial markets have stabilized \nsomewhat, they remain fragile and vulnerable \nto shocks. The\u00a0World\u00a0Economic Outlook Update, \nJanuary\u00a02019 of the International\u00a0Monetary\u00a0Fund \nprojects a large economic contraction in Turkey \nin\u00a02019 because of monetary policy tightening and \nunfavorable external financing\u00a0conditions, followed by \na slow recovery in\u00a02020.\n\nThe lira\u2019s steep depreciation made Turkish goods \ncheaper in Central Asia but, at the same time, made \nCentral Asian goods more expensive in Turkey. \nSlower\u00a0economic growth also reduces Turkish demand \nfor imports, including imports from Central Asia. \nIn\u00a0the first 11 months of 2018, growth in Central Asian \nexports to Turkey slowed from the same period in 2017 \nfor all the economies except Georgia (box figure\u00a02). \n\n2\u2002 Growth of exports from Central Asia to Turkey\n\nJanuary\u2013November 2017\nJanuary\u2013November 2018\n\n% change year on year\n\nARM AZE\n\nGEO\n\nKAZ\n\nKGZ\n\nTAJ\n\nTKM UZB\n\nARM = Armenia, AZE = Azerbaijan, GEO = Georgia, KAZ = Kazakhstan, \nKGZ\u00a0=\u00a0Kyrgyz Republic, TAJ = Tajikistan, TKM = Turkmenistan, \nUZB\u00a0=\u00a0Uzbekistan.\nNote: Using mirrored imports data from Turkey.\nSources: IMF Direction of Trade Statistics; Haver Analytics; ADB estimates.\n\ncontinued next page\n\n\f22(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n1.1.2\u2002Continued\n\nBy contrast, imports from Turkey into Central Asia \nincreased for all the economies except Kazakhstan and \nTurkmenistan.\n\nIn 2018, FDI flows from Turkey markedly \n\ncontracted from 2017, by 76% to Azerbaijan and by \n86% to Kazakhstan, though they picked up to Georgia. \nFurther, remittances sent from Turkey to Georgia have \nbeen falling since August 2018. Azerbaijan\u2019s financial \nexposure to Turkey can become a concern in the event \nof default by Turkish borrowers because Azerbaijan \nhad $4 billion of its sovereign wealth fund deposited \nin Turkish banks in 2017 and more than $2 billion \nin outstanding private sector loans to financial and \nnonfinancial borrowers in Turkey in 2018. \n\nTo more formally assess spillover from Turkey\u2019s \n\ngrowth slowdown on Central Asia, the impact of \nTurkey\u2019s growth on Central Asian economies was \nseparately estimated using a vector autoregression \nanalysis for Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and \nTajikistan.

Reduced financial stress in \nrecent months provides some grounds for optimism \nabout Turkey\u2019s growth prospects beyond the very \nshort term.

Trade growth will be much \nlower than it has been lately, and some global supply chain \nreallocations will occur in response to the trade conflict. \nThe outlook assumes that some headway is made on \nremoving technology restrictions, but also that some sticking \npoints, such as digital trade issues and technology transfer \nmodalities, will continue to affect investment decisions in \nthe first half of 2019. \n\nbalance will continue into 2019 and 2020 (Figure 1.1.17). \nIn\u00a02018, it dropped to the equivalent of 0.8% of GDP in \n2018, the lowest it has been since the Asian financial crisis \nof 1997\u20131998. This largely reflects a new focus in the PRC \non its domestic economy, as well as lower global demand \nand muted export activity spurred by the trade conflict. \nThe\u00a0current account surplus for the region will narrow \nfurther to 0.4% in 2019 and 0.3% in\u00a02020, reflecting \nsignificantly narrower gaps in the PRC, and in some other \nlarger economies in East and Southeast\u00a0Asia.

In\u00a0Southeast Asia, aside from trade policy \nuncertainty, softer global fuel prices will exert downward \npressure on commodity exports despite likely higher volumes \nshipped, while higher imports for intermediate and capital \ngoods to supply manufacturers and public projects will likely \nbalance some of the gains the Philippines and Viet\u00a0Nam garner \nin higher\u00a0exports. \n\nThe deterioration of developing Asia\u2019s current account \n\n10-year average (2009\u20132018): 3.2%\n\n2.1\n\n2.4\n\n2.2\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n\f24(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n1.1.17\u2002Current account balance, developing Asia \n\n1.1.18\u2002World current account balance\n\nMost subregions will see current account balances \nnarrow in 2019 and 2020 \u2026\n\n\u2026shrinking the regional surplus with the rest of the world to the \nequivalent of 0.1% of global GDP in 2019, even as the US de\ufb01 cit widens.\n\n2018\n2019\n2020\n\n% of GDP\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20133\n\nUnited States\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRest of developing Asia\nOther industrial countries\nRest of the world\nWorld\n\n% of GDP\n\n% of world GDP\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\nCentral Asia East Asia\n\nSouth Asia Southeast\n\nThe Paci\ufb01c\n(right scale)\n\nDeveloping\nAsia\n\nAsia\n\n2010\u20132015\nAverage\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nForecast\n\nGDP = gross domestic product.\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nGDP = gross domestic product.\nSources: Haver Analytics (accessed 16 March 2019); Asian Development \nOutlook database.\n\nWith declining global growth tempering export demand \n\nand a service deficit persisting, the PRC current account \nsurplus is forecast to disappear in 2019 and become a thin \ndeficit in\u00a02020. The surpluses of the other economies in \nEast\u00a0Asia are expected to weaken further to the forecast \nhorizon as the impact of frontloading of exports across \nthe region during mid-2018 reverses, and as trade policy \nuncertainty continues to hamper external demand. \n\nInter- and intraregional trade patterns in developing \nAsia look likely to shift more quickly than usual in 2019 \nand 2020 as global production relocates in response to the \ntrade conflict. Some relocation will reflect a long-term \ntrend toward greater reliance on domestic demand, \ngiven large structural changes in the past 2 decades, \nparticularly in the\u00a0PRC. And some will reflect new trade \nagreements such\u00a0as the Comprehensive and Progressive \nAgreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership signing in early \n2019. Slower\u00a0trade this year and next should narrow the \nregional current account surplus with the rest of the world \n(Figure 1.1.18). With the reallocation within the region of \nproduction for some US\u2013PRC trade, the pattern of trade \nis likely to show an increased share of trade within\u00a0Asia. \nIn\u00a0addition, demand in the PRC and the US for imports from \nthe rest of developing\u00a0Asia will rise, slightly widening the \nUS\u00a0trade deficit with developing Asia excluding the PRC \n(Figure\u00a01.1.19). \n\nExports\nImports\nTrade de\ufb01cit\n\n$ billion\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n1.1.19\u2002 US trade deficit with developing Asia, \n\nexcluding the PRC\n\nTrade redirection in response to the US\u2013PRC trade con\ufb02 ict \nshould increase demand in US for imports from the rest of \ndeveloping Asia.\n\n2012 to 2017\nAverage\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nForecast\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from Haver Analytics; \nADB\u00a0Multi-regional Input\u2013Output Table (MRIOT) Database, \nand\u00a0updates from Abiad et al.

Without\u00a0a\u00a0clear end \ndate for the negotiations, estimates of the effects of foregone trade \nare difficult to calculate, and they provide only one aspect of the \nfar-reaching impact of the trade conflict. The\u00a0baseline scenario \nassumes that tariffs remain at current levels throughout 2019 and \n2020, with additional tariffs avoided by some agreement\u2014perhaps \nrequiring the PRC to wind back some regulatory restrictions \non high-tech investment, for example, or to ease some financial \nrestrictions. A\u00a0step in this direction is a new investment law the \nPRC passed on 15\u00a0March 2019 that addresses priority issues for \nforeign investors regarding the protection of intellectual property \nrights. This scenario would have a relatively benign impact over \nthe medium term, much of which may already have been priced in \nby global markets. \n\nThe outcome of the negotiations is likely to influence \nbroad areas of developing Asia\u2019s economy beyond its effects \non tariffs and trade. As discussed in Asian Development \nOutlook 2018 Update last September, the tariffs enacted \nlast year will likely suppress and redirect trade, affecting \nemployment. Estimates of these effects have since been \nupdated to reflect the assumed continuation of existing \ntariff rates into 2019 and\u00a02020. Relative to there being \nno trade conflict (the\u00a0situation in December\u00a02017), global \nGDP is estimated to be 0.05% lower by the end of 2020. \nThe PRC comes out as worst hit, with GDP 0.25% lower \nthan in a no-conflict scenario, but the US also suffers a \nnet loss of 0.13% of GDP. On the other hand, the NIEs \nmay see a net gain of 0.06% of aggregate GDP, and the \nASEAN-5 a gain of 0.04%, if trade redirection materializes \n(Figure\u00a01.1.20). These are very small percentages; for the \nNIEs, falling external demand more than offsets this effect, \ncausing growth in the outlook period to underperform \n2018. Taipei,China, for example, will see growth drop from \n2.6% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2019 and 2.0% in 2020 as business \nconfidence suffers heavily under both the trade conflict and \nthe slowdown in external demand.\n\nEmployment in key areas of the protagonists\u2019 economies \n\n1.1.20\u2002 GDP impact of the trade conflict \n\nby\u00a0economic region, current\u00a0scenario\n\nThe impact of tariffs imposed so far is small but hits the\u00a0PRC \nand the US the hardest with both countries losing small \npercentages of GDP. \n\nTrade redirection effects\nDirect and indirect effects\nNet impact with partial redirection\n\n% of GDP\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.1\n\n\u20130.2\n\n\u20130.3\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.01\n\n\u20130.05\n\n\u20130.13\n\n\u20130.25\nPRC\n\nWorld\n\nUS\n\nNIEs ASEAN-5 Rest\nof Asia\n\nASEAN-5 = five large economies in the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, the\u00a0Philippines, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam), GDP = gross domestic product, NIEs = newly \nindustrialized economies (Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; \nSingapore; and Taipei,China), PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, \nRest of Asia = Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, \nFiji, India, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, \nMongolia, Pakistan, and Sri\u00a0Lanka, US = United States.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from ADB\u00a0Multi-regional  \nInput\u2013Output Table (MRIOT) database and Abiad et al.

With lower \nexports and lower imports, the US\u2013PRC trade imbalance \nwill narrow over the outlook period very marginally from its \nrecord gap of $419.2\u00a0billion in 2018 (Figure\u00a01.1.21).\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) flow patterns between \n\nthe PRC and the US suggest that the trade conflict can \naffect production links (Figure 1.1.22). Current investment \nflows provide some clues about trade and growth patterns \n1\u20132 years from now. For 2018 as a whole, US FDI outflows \nto the PRC surged, particularly toward the end of 2018, and \nespecially into auto components and chemical products. \nThese goods are subject to US import tariffs, suggesting that \nsome investment may have been motivated by the desire \nto circumvent tariffs on future exports or in expectation \nof future investment restrictions. Still, the PRC receives \non average only about 12% of total FDI from the US. In \ncontrast, FDI flows from the PRC to the US barely rose, \nand now constitute only 7% of the PRC\u2019s total FDI flows \ncompared to 11% on average in 2011\u20132017. All flows of FDI \ninto the PRC slowed sharply in Q4 after having increased in \nthe first 3 quarters of 2018, owing mainly to the unresolved \ntrade\u00a0conflict. \n\nThe PRC has been tightening its investment links with the rest \n\nof developing Asia in recent years, but the trend seems to have \naccelerated under the trade conflict in 2018, just as intraregional \ntrade links strengthened. This trend is expected to continue to \nthe forecast horizon (Figure 1.1.23). Greenfield\u00a0FDI from the \nPRC to the rest of developing Asia soared by 198% in 2018, with \nthe region\u2019s share climbing from 40% of the PRC total in the \nprevious 8 years to 60%. Investment went to diverse sectors, \nsuch as renewable energy in Indonesia; oil, gas, and metals in the \nPhilippines; software and electronics in Singapore; real estate in \nHong Kong, China; leisure and entertainment in the ROK; and \neven high-tech textile production in Kazakhstan. Investment \napproval data indicate that FDI into machinery and electronic \ncomponents is poised to grow in Malaysia and Viet Nam, though \nactual investment has been slow so far in 2019. FDI from the US \nto developing Asia excluding the PRC also rose, by 71% in 2018 to \nreach its highest since the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, \nthough it is still less than 20% of all US outbound FDI. \n\nGoing forward, the outcome of the negotiations has the \n\npotential to shape FDI flows into high-tech over the medium\u00a0term. \nThe FDI index of regulatory restrictions sheds light on this \nissue (Figure 1.1.24). The most protected areas are not high-tech \nand typically involve non-traded services other than air travel. \nNevertheless, taking into account restrictions in all areas, the PRC \nis generally more restrictive than most of the advanced economies. \nMoreover, according to data available for 13 economies in \ndeveloping Asia that together account for 87% of regional income, \nthe PRC is the second-most-restrictive economy in the region, after \nthe Philippines. It is particularly restrictive in high-tech services. \n\n\fChallenges from rising headwinds(cid:30)(cid:30)27\n\n1.1.22\u2002 PRC and US outbound greenfield investment \n\n1.1.23\u2002 Greenfield investments to developing Asia  \n\nby\u00a0host\u00a0region\n\nby source\n\nGreen\ufb01eld investment\u2014de\ufb01ned as equity investment into \nnew\u00a0projects\u2014from the PRC and the US rose in\u00a02018 despite \nsome\u00a0tightening of restrictions at the end of 2018\u2026 \n\n\u2026 but there was an even sharper pickup of investment into \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia from all regions, particularly\u00a0the PRC.\n\nRest of the world\nEuro area and Japan\nUS\nPRC\nRest of developing Asia\n\nEuro area and Japan\nUnited States\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRest of the world\nWorld\n\n$ billion\n\nFrom the PRC to:\n\n$ billion\n\nFrom the US to:\n\n$ billion\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2011\u20132017\naverage\n\n2018\nPreliminary\n\n2011\u20132017\naverage\n\n2018\nPreliminary\n\n2005\u20132014\naverage\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from Financial Times, fDi Markets. https://www.fdimarkets.com/ (accessed 16 March 2019).  \nSee https://aric.adb.org/pdf/AEIR_FDI_Database.pdf for data description and methodology.\n\n1.1.24\u2002 FDI regulatory restrictiveness, 2017\n\n1.1.25\u2002 Outward greenfield investment to key technology \n\nThe index of FDI regulatory restrictiveness\u2014indicating more restrictions\u2014is high \nin developing Asia, especially in the telecommunications\u00a0sector in the PRC...\n\nUnited States\nOECD excluding the US and the Republic of Korea\nRest of developing Asia\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nsectors by\u00a0destination, 2014\u20132018\n\n... but FDI between the PRC and the US is small in the sectors targeted by \nUS\u00a0negotiators: aerospace equipment, energy, biotechnology, engineering \nservices, the internet of things, and defense. \n\nEuro area\nUnited States\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nRest of developing Asia\nRest of the world\nTotal\n\n$2.5\n(3.3% share of\nall outward FDI)\n\n$ billion\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n$26.5\n(18.6% share of\nall outward FDI)\n\n$ billion\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nUnited States\n\nFDI = foreign direct investment.\nNote: The\u00a0key technology sectors affected by negotiations are aerospace, \nbiotechnology, industrial machinery and equipment, software and \ninformation technology services, semiconductors, and space and defense.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from Financial Times, fDi Markets. \nhttps://www.fdimarkets.com/ (accessed 16 March 2019).

These\u00a0areas do not loom particularly large in their \nshare of FDI flows, as they are mostly between the US and other \nadvanced economies. Over the 5 years to 2018, these sectors \naccounted for 18.6% of all FDI inflows from the US, and the \namount of those sectors bound for PRC was only 1.6% of all US \noutward FDI; and 3.3% of total outbound FDI from the PRC was \nin those sectors, but only 0.6% bound to the\u00a0US\u00a0(Figure\u00a01.1.25). \nNevertheless, one potential casualty of new restrictions would \nbe the semiconductor industry. At the end of 2018, the industry \nwas forecast to grow by a meager 2.6% in 2019, following 2 \nyears of double-digit growth. Now estimates are for sales to \ncontract by 3.0% this year (Figure 1.1.26). Production may \nbe thwarted because of the national security concerns of \nEuropean Union, PRC, and US governments that geopolitical \nrivals may inappropriately use semiconductors in high-tech \ndefense applications. However, semiconductors are also used \nin mass consumer goods. Semiconductor production for mass \napplications is thus likely to be lower as well (Figure 1.1.27). \nSmall\u00a0businesses\u00a0in\u00a0high-tech sectors globally\u2014which tend to be \nhighly innovative but rely on open source technologies\u2014could \nsuffer disproportionately if protracted negotiations continue to \naffect semiconductors. \n\n1.1.26\u2002 Semiconductor trends and forecast\n\n1.1.27\u2002Semiconductor revenue, by type\n\nSemiconductor sales are expected to disappoint\u2026\n\n\u2026aff  ecting their use in many other commercial and consumer applications, \npossibly\u00a0thwarting innovation.\n\nSEAJ manufacturing equipment billings\nSEAJ manufacturing equipment billings (January 2019 forecast)\nWSTS revenue\nWSTS revenue (February 2019 forecast)\n\n% change, 3-month moving average\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\nDiscrete semiconductors\nOptoelectronics\nSensors\nIntegrated circuits\nTotal\n\n$ billion\n\n$412.2\n(21.6% change\nyear on year)\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nSEAJ = Semiconductor Equipment Association of Japan, WSTS = World \nSemiconductor Trade Statistics.\nSources: Semiconductor Equipment Association of Japan. http://www.seaj.or.jp/; \nWSTS news release, February 2019. https://www.wsts.org/.\n\nForecast\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: World Semiconductor Trade Statistics News Release February 2019. \nhttps://www.wsts.org/.\n\n$468.8\n(13.7% change\nyear on year)\n\n$454.5\n(\u20133.0% change\nyear on year)\n\n\fChallenges from rising headwinds(cid:30)(cid:30)29\n\nThe outlook cloudy, the risks tilting \nto the downside \nThe greatest risks to the outlook arise from the US\u2013PRC trade \nconflict. Tariff hikes that were originally scheduled to take \neffect in January were postponed as negotiations continued. \nThis\u00a0development suggests that the risk of tariff escalation \nhas subsided somewhat since the September publication of \nAsian\u00a0Development Outlook 2018 Update. But the risks still tilt to the \ndownside. The sluggish pace of negotiations, and fluctuating views \nabout whether a resolution is on the horizon or not, have expanded \nthe cloud of uncertainty for businesses, particularly those engaged \nin trade. With the possibility of protracted negotiations and periodic \nannouncements of tightening regulations governing high-tech \ninvestment, uncertainty could deepen and spread to other sectors of \nthe economy beyond those directly affected. A\u00a0news-based indicator \nof trade policy uncertainty finds investor perceptions of trade policy \nuncertainty\u00a0at an all-time high\u00a0(Box\u00a01.1.3). Uncertainty\u00a0is\u00a0particularly \ndamaging to investment, which depends heavily on investors\u2019 view \nof the future. Greater uncertainty can cause investors to delay \ncostly and irreversible investment. Box\u00a01.1.3\u00a0provides evidence that \nspikes in trade policy uncertainty like the current one can reduce \nPRC investment by about 1%. A\u00a0possible upside risk, though, is that \nnegotiations will quickly bring an agreement that lowers existing \ntariffs. Recent announcements can be read as gestures of good faith \non both sides, raising the possibility of an agreement being reached, \nat which time trade and investment barriers may be reduced. \n\n1.1.3\u2002Trade policy uncertainty: trends and impact\n\nAnalysis in the September Asian Development \nOutlook 2018 Update showed how economies and \ntheir sectors in developing Asia would be affected \nby tariffs already imposed and under various \nscenarios of escalated tariffs. A potentially important \nand distinct concern is uncertainty about trade \npolicy. Trade policy uncertainty (TPU) may cause \nfirms to postpone investment decisions until the \nuncertainty is resolved. The\u00a0literature has found \nthat investment can sometimes pick up in periods \nof TPU, when, for example, the uncertainty is over \na country\u2019s negotiations to join a trade agreement \n(Hlatshwayo\u00a0forthcoming). This analysis provides new \nmeasures of TPU pertinent to Asia, documents trends \nin these measures, and provides initial evidence of \nuncertainty\u2019s impact on investment.\n\nTo measure TPU, a useful resource is the \n\nnews-based index developed in Baker, Bloom, and \nDavis\u00a0(2016). The indicator utilizes the number \nof news articles that mention TPU and captures \nthe degree of uncertainty that the public perceives \n\nabout trade policy actions and their consequences. \nBox\u00a0figure\u00a01 plots the measure of US TPU using the \nindex. Readings peaked in the early 1990s during \nnegotiations on the North American Free\u00a0Trade \nAgreement but have been rising again over the past\u00a02 \nyears. Box figure 2 plots a newly constructed\u00a0variant of \nthis index that captures US TPU vis-\u00e0-vis\u00a0Asia. This is \nat an all-time high. \n\nTPU indicators can also be constructed \n\nfor individual economies in the region. \nBox\u00a0figure\u00a03\u00a0plots\u00a0the TPU indicator for the PRC, \nconstructed in Hlatshwayo (forthcoming), from \nJanuary 1995 to January\u00a02019.

Triggers for such a scenario include \nheightened fiscal uncertainty deepening the slowdown of economic \nactivity in the US, or a disorderly exit of the United Kingdom from \nthe European Union causing a sharper slowdown there. The direct \neffects of Brexit on developing Asia through trade channels are likely \nto be small. Even for countries like Sri Lanka\u2014for which the United \nKingdom is an important trade partner, and which benefits from \ntariff-free entry of its products into that market\u2014the forecast effects \nof Brexit are small (Box\u00a01.1.4). But a disorderly Brexit might roil \nglobal financial markets, worsen uncertainty, and raise risk aversion, \nwhich would affect developing Asia more broadly. Within\u00a0the\u00a0region, \nwhile the PRC is working both to support growth and to reduce \nfinancial risks, various external or internal shocks could still \nmaterialize, making it a challenge for the authorities to continue to \nengineer controlled growth moderation. \n\n1.1.4\u2002How might Brexit affect developing Asia? Evidence from Sri Lanka\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK), a member of the \nEuropean\u00a0Union (EU) since 1973, held a referendum \non 23\u00a0June 2016 on whether to withdraw from the \nEU. The\u00a0decision to leave the EU, or Brexit, passed by \na narrow margin. On 29 March 2017, the UK invoked \nArticle 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which provides 2 years \nto negotiate an exit from the EU. As\u00a0Asian Development \nOutlook 2019 goes to press, the deadline to close \nnegotiations looms large, and UK\u00a0parliamentary \ndeliberations are in full swing to either approve a plan \nalready agreed with the EU, extend the negotiations, \nor institute measures to manage a \u201chard Brexit.\u201d \nUncertainty over the fate of the negotiations poses \na downside risk to the economy of the UK and \nthe EU, and the global economy at large, including \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia. There are many channels through \nwhich Brexit could have an economic impact on the \nrest of the world, including confidence channels that \nare difficult to anticipate and quantify. This analysis \nsheds light on the economic impact of Brexit by \nexamining the trade channel closely, using Sri Lanka to \nillustrate.\n\nOne of the special bilateral trade arrangements \nthat some developing economies have with the EU is \nthe Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+), \na preferential tariff system that grants full tariff \nremoval on more than two-thirds of EU tariff lines.a \nWith Brexit, the UK will no longer be covered by \nGSP+. Sri\u00a0Lanka and other exporters can be directly \naffected by Brexit because they lose access to the \nUK market through the EU\u00a0GSP+ program, and what \nreplaces GSP+ is still unclear. Currently, the UK is \nSri\u00a0Lanka\u2019s second-largest trading partner, taking 8.3% \nof Sri\u00a0Lanka\u2019s exports.b\n\nAnalysis of the economic impact of Brexit employs \n\ntwo scenarios, both of which influence trade flows \nthrough changes in tariffs. The first scenario is no-deal \nBrexit, which assumes that trade between the UK and \nthe EU will be reduced by higher tariffs post-Brexit. \nThe second scenario is tariff escalation between \nSri\u00a0Lanka and the UK, which extends the analysis \nto explore potential impacts if Sri Lanka\u2019s exports to \nthe UK become subject to a tariff when the UK is no \nlonger party to the GSP+. In both scenarios, the tariff \nchange from the baseline is assumed to be equal to \nthe average most-favored nation rate of 5.62% imposed \nby the UK and the EU on manufactured goods.c \nAssuming\u00a0that the UK reaches the Brexit date without \na deal with the EU or other countries, trade between \nthe UK and the EU, as well as bilateral trade between \nSri\u00a0Lanka and the UK, will then be subject to tariff \nrates charged by the EU in its common customs tariff \nor the most-favored nation rates.\n\nThe effects on Sri Lanka\u2019s economy through the \ntrade channel are small (box\u00a0figure). There\u00a0are no \ndirect effects from increased tariffs between the UK \nand the EU, and indirect effects through international \nsupply chains shave 0.06% off Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP. \nThe\u00a0adverse indirect effects may even be offset by a \npotential gain of 0.08% of GDP if trade redirection \nto accommodate new tariffs between the UK and EU \nallowed Sri Lanka to provide more agricultural and \nindustrial exports. If\u00a0these gains from trade redirection \nmaterialized\u2014and it should be stressed that they are \nneither automatic nor assured\u2014the net impact would \nbe small but positive at 0.01%. If Sri Lanka faced \nhigher tariffs when the UK exits the EU and its GSP+ \nprogram, the direct effects of those tariffs would be \n\ncontinued next page\n\n\f32(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n1.1.4\u2002Continued\n\nImpact of Brexit on Sri Lanka\n\nDirect and indirect effects\nTrade redirection effects\nNet impact\n\nA.

Trade redirection would potentially \noffset 0.07% of the loss. \n\nUnder both scenarios, industry appears to be \nthe sector most affected, with certain segments like \ntextiles and garments suffering significant losses. \nThe\u00a0combined effects of higher tariffs and disrupted \nsupply links could hit industry gross value added \nby as much as 0.08%\u20130.28%, though this could be \noffset by trade redirection. The effects on agriculture \nand services are smaller. In a scenario where tariffs \nescalate between Sri Lanka and the UK, textiles would \nbe hurt the most. The direct and indirect effects would \nreduce textile and garment exports to the UK by 7.7%, \nand textiles and garments gross value added by 0.85%. \nTrade redirection would attenuate but not completely \noffset these losses. \n\nIn sum, the economy-wide effects of Brexit \nthrough trade channels are small even for Sri \nLanka, which has strong trade ties with the UK and \nrisks losing a preferential trade arrangement if the \nUK leaves the EU. This suggests that the effects \nthrough trade channels on developing\u00a0Asia more \nbroadly are likely to be small as well. This\u00a0updated \nassessment is consistent with analysis in the \nJuly\u00a02016 Asian\u00a0Development Outlook Supplement, \n\nwhich assessed the impact on developing\u00a0Asia to\u00a0be \nsmall. An\u00a0important\u00a0caveat\u00a0is\u00a0that a disorderly \nBrexit could significantly affect growth prospects \nin the EU, as highlighted in the main text of this \nchapter, as well as rattle global financial markets. \nThese\u00a0channels\u00a0are\u00a0harder to quantify and could have \nmore significant implications for developing Asia.\n\na  GSP+ provides tariff exemptions to vulnerable developing \ncountries from the more general rules of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) on exports to the EU. The European \nCommission states that it has three main objectives: \nto contribute to poverty reduction by expanding \nexports from poorer countries, to promote sustainable \ndevelopment and good governance, and to ensure that EU \nfinancial and economic interests are safeguarded.\nb  Other ADB member countries covered by GSP+ are \n\nArmenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and \nthe Philippines.\n\nc  Under most favored nation (MFN) rule of the WTO, the \nUK cannot decrease tariffs for any country unless a trade \ndeal has been agreed with it. In 2018, the UK submitted \nWTO schedules of goods tariffs following its withdrawal \nfrom the EU, which is pending approval by the WTO. \nIn the absence of this information, a no-deal scenario is \nassumed wherein the UK applies rates close to the MFN \nrates to avoid damaging trade effects. Therefore, this \nstudy applies the average MFN rate of 5.62%.\n\n\fChallenges from rising headwinds(cid:30)(cid:30)33\n\nOne risk that has subsided since the publication of \nAsian\u00a0Development Outlook 2018 Update is the possibility of \ninterest rates rising faster than anticipated. Weakening global \nand US economic activity in late 2018 and early 2019 motivated \nthe US Federal Reserve to bring to a pause its monetary \ntightening, and the previous view that the Fed would hike rates \nthree or four times in 2019 no longer holds. Despite this, the \nrisk of financial volatility remains. There is now also greater \nuncertainty regarding US monetary policy, and estimates show \nthat this is associated with greater exchange rate volatility \nfor Asian currencies (Box\u00a01.1.5). And, while the jitters evident \nin emerging markets in 2018 have abated for now, this could \nreemerge, with consequences for domestic financial conditions. \n\n1.1.5\u2002 Impact of US monetary policy uncertainty on Asian exchange rates\n\nAnalysis here examines the impact of uncertainty \nabout US monetary policy on the exchange rates of \nAsian countries. Currency turmoil in mid-2018\u2014during \nwhich Turkey and Argentina suffered large currency \ndepreciation in the wake of the US Federal\u00a0Reserve \nsteadily raising its interest rates since 2017\u2014\nunderlined the role US monetary policy can play in \nshaping exchange rate behavior in emerging markets. \nRegional\u00a0currencies, including the Indian rupee \nand Indonesian rupiah, have recovered fairly well \nsince Q4\u00a0of 2018. In light of slowing US and global \ngrowth, the future trajectory of US monetary policy \nis increasingly uncertain. The Fed is now expected \nto take a more cautious and gradual approach to \nmonetary policy normalization, but how cautious and \nhow gradual is the subject of much debate. \n\nUncertainty about US interest rates may affect \nexchange rates in emerging markets independently \nof what the rates actually are. Systematic analysis \nof news reports confirms that the public is \nbecoming increasingly unclear about the exact \ntrajectory of US\u00a0monetary policy. Recent research \nfinds that searching for relevant text can deliver \nuseful\u00a0information on uncertainty about economic \npolicy. Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) constructed a \nnews-based index of US monetary policy uncertainty \n(MPU) that attempts to capture the degree of \nuncertainty that the public perceives about the Fed\u2019s \nactions and their effects. The\u00a0MPU index for the US \nremains elevated, most likely reflecting the uncertain \neffect of global\u00a0trade tensions and global growth \nslowdown on the Fed\u2019s policy calculus.\n\nThe box figure plots data on monetary \npolicy uncertainty based on Baker, Bloom, and \nDavis\u00a0(2016) from January 1985 to January 2019. \nIt\u00a0shows large spikes occurred around times of \n\nuncertainty: Black\u00a0Monday in October 1987, the \n11\u00a0September attacks, the\u00a0March 2003 invasion of \nIraq, the\u00a0Lehman\u00a0Brothers collapse in September \n2008, prior to the October 2015 Federal Open \nMarket Committee meetings to discuss interest rate \nliftoff from the zero lower bound, Brexit, and the \nNovember\u00a02016 election in the US. Another spike \nseems to be brewing recently, presumably in response \nto the issues surrounding trade uncertainty and \nUS\u00a0federal government shutdown.\n\nPark, Qureshi, Tian, and Villaruel (forthcoming) \n\nexamined the effect of uncertainty about US Fed \nmonetary policy on exchange rate fluctuations in \n10\u00a0Asian economies using monthly data from 2006 to \n2019. The study combined the news-based measure of \nmonetary policy uncertainty with a measure of actual \nexchange rates and the interest rate spread using a \ncountry-specific model of exchange rate returns and \nvolatility called the GARCH model (Bollerslev\u00a01986). \nThis framework enabled the capture not only of \ntime variance in the exchange rate market but also \nextracted the impacts of MPU on both exchange rate \nvalues and variance of return.\n\nMonthly data on the US federal funds rate, \nexchange rates against the US dollar, and policy \ninterest rates in the selected Asian economies were \ncollected from Bloomberg. Data availability limited \nthe sample period to February 2006\u2013January 2019 \nin India; Indonesia; Japan; Malaysia; the PRC; \nthe Philippines; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; \nTaipei,China; and Thailand. In the analysis, the \nmonthly percentage change in MPU and exchange \nrates are constructed using log difference between \nlevels in the current and previous month. The interest \nrate spread was defined as the difference between \neach Asian economy\u2019s policy interest rate and the \n\ncontinued next page\n\n\f34(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n1.1.5\u2002Continued\n\nMonetary policy uncertainty index for the United States\n\nIndex\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n1985\n\nBlack Monday,\nOctober 1987\n\nJapanese asset\nprice bubble\n\n11 September attacks\n\nInvasion of Iraq,\nMarch 2003\n\nCollapse of Lehman Brothers,\nSeptember 2008\n\n1998 \ufb01nancial crisis in the\nRussian Federation\n\nLiftoff uncertainty,\nOctober 2015\n\nBrexit, \nJune 2016\n\n1987\n\n1989\n\n1991\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2019\n\nNote: The figure plots data on monetary policy uncertainty based on Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016).\nSources: ADB estimates; Economic Policy Uncertainty. www.policyuncertainty.com (accessed 1 March 2019).\n\nUS federal\u00a0fund rate. The econometric analysis then \nexamined how US monetary policy uncertainty would \naffect return patterns in exchange rates in Asian \neconomies, in terms of both values and variances. \n\nThe empirical results indicated that uncertainty \n\nabout US monetary policy affected exchange rate \nvariability but not the exchange rate levels of Asian \ncountries. The box table reports the estimated effect \nof uncertainty about US monetary policy on the \nvariance of exchange rate in the 10 Asian economies. \nThe effect was uniformly positive. It appeared that \ngreater uncertainty about the path of US interest rates \ngenerated greater diversity of belief about exchange \nrates among participants in foreign exchange markets. \nMore diverse beliefs meant more diverse trading and \nhence more volatile exchange rates. The magnitudes \nvaried across economies. For example, during the \nsample period, the average monthly increase in MPU \nwas 0.59%, which was associated with an increase \nin exchange rate return variance of 0.02 in the \nPhilippines. When the MPU rose sharply in 2018 by \n14%, variance increased by 0.50. Similarly, exchange \n\nrate return variance rose by approximately 0.30 in \nIndonesia in 2018.\n\nAnalysis suggested that periods of heightened \nuncertainty about US monetary policy tended to be \nperiods of heightened volatility in Asian exchange \nrates. This strengthens the case for more closely \nmonitoring exchange rates when there is less clarity \nabout the Fed\u2019s course of action. Although heightened \nvolatility strengthens the case for measures to stabilize \nexchange rates, a great deal of caution is advised \nbecause US monetary policy uncertainty is just one of \nmany factors that affect exchange rates.\n\nReferences:\nBaker, S.

This resulted from a confluence of factors \nincluding a steady rise in US policy rates that caused a shift \nin market sentiment away from riskier assets in the region. \nThose factors, woven with trade tensions, led investors to \nreevaluate their emerging market portfolios more generally. \nIndeed, some regional currencies depreciated significantly \nagainst the US dollar in 2018.\n\nBy late 2018, most regional currencies had stabilized, \nand since then several have appreciated. As Box 1.1.1 makes \nclear, however, regional exchange rates are not out of \nthe woods; local currency depreciation and challenging \nfinancial market conditions could recur. With the recent \nsubsiding of the earlier risk that the US Federal Reserve \nwould raise its rates more quickly than expected, the path \nfor normalizing monetary policy in the US has become \nless certain. And, as analysis in Box 1.1.5 shows, periods of \nheightened US monetary policy uncertainty are associated \nwith greater volatility in bilateral exchange rates vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe US\u00a0dollar. \n\nAs the present analysis documents, exchange rate \n\nfluctuations can have significant effects on domestic financial \nconditions in many open economies. These effects can work \nthrough two distinct channels with opposing effects: the \ntrade channel and the financial channel, as described in more \ndetail below. Recent years have seen more analysis of these \neffects, most notably in a Bank of International Settlements \nstudy (Hoffman, Shim, and Shin 2017). The present analysis \nexplores these issues in the context of ADB developing \nmember countries. It provides quantitative estimates of the \nrelative strength of the trade and financial channels\u2019 effects \non domestic financial conditions, examines whether the \nstrength of these channels varies across selected economies in \ndeveloping Asia, and discusses how exchange rate fluctuations \nin 2018 affected domestic financial conditions in the region. \nIt\u00a0considers the role of the US dollar in global liquidity \nconditions and illustrates how exchange rate changes can have \nsignificant impacts on sovereign credit risk premiums.\n\n\f36(cid:15)(cid:15)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n75\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\nExchange rates and the transmission \nof\u00a0global \ufb01nancial conditions\nOne of the main causes of the Asian financial crisis of \n1997\u20131998 was currency and maturity mismatches in the \ndebt held in many economies in the region. Large amounts \nof short-term debt denominated in foreign currency were \nused to finance long-term investments that yielded revenue \nin local currency. Deteriorating values of local currencies \nin\u00a01997, despite closely managed exchange rates in the region \nat the time, triggered the crisis by inflating external debt to \nunsustainable levels and prompting large capital outflows.\n\nToday, financial systems in the region have generally \nbecome more resilient, thanks to a wide range of reforms \nimplemented after the Asian financial crisis. However, \nthe US dollar remains the major funding currency for the \nregion\u2019s growing external debt. In recent years, the value \nof outstanding US dollar-denominated international debt \nsecurities has increased as a percentage of total external \ndebt in a number of Asian economies (Figure\u00a01.2.2). \nThe\u00a0concentration of foreign borrowing in a single currency \nleaves the region\u2019s financial systems vulnerable to external \nshocks through unexpected changes in global currency \nliquidity conditions and related capital flow reversals, \nwith significant implications for domestic financial and \nmacroeconomic conditions. \n\nIn this regard, the bilateral US dollar exchange \nrate can transmit global dollar funding conditions into \nemerging economies. Recent data suggest that exchange \nrates movements\u2014both the bilateral US dollar exchange \nrate (BER) and the trade-weighted nominal effective \nexchange rate (NEER)\u2014correlated throughout 2018 in most \neconomies in emerging Asia with changes in sovereign bond \nspreads (Table 1.2.1). The bond spreads are measures of \ndomestic financing conditions relative to global conditions, \nas they show the yield premium between domestic and \nforeign\u00a0bonds. \n\nIn 2018, the correlation between changes in the spread \nand exchange rates was highest in Malaysia and lowest in \nthe Republic of Korea. Meaningful correlation was observed \nin other economies. Positive correlation indicates that \ncurrency depreciation tended to come in tandem with a \nwidening spread, or a tightening of domestic financing \nconditions, and currency appreciation with a loosening \nof domestic financing conditions as the spread narrowed. \nCorrelation coefficients tended to be higher and more \nconsistent for the BER than for the NEER, as the sign of the \nlatter\u2019s coefficient tended to vary more across economies.\n\n1.2.2\u2002 US dollar-denominated international debt \nsecurities as a percentage of external debt\n\nIndia\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nPhilippines\nRepublic of Korea\nSingapore\nThailand\n\n% of external debt\n\n1996\n\n2000\n\n2004\n\n2008\n\n2012\n\n2016 2018\n\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Bank for \nInternational\u00a0Settlements and CEIC Data Company \n(accessed\u00a020\u00a0December 2018).\n\n1.2.1\u2002 Correlation between changes in sovereign \nbond spreads and exchange rates in 2018\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nCountry\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nBER\n\n\u20020.35\n\n\u20020.38\n\n\u20020.67\n\n\u20130.02\n\n\u20020.85\n\n\u20020.24\n\n\u20020.40\n\n\u20020.69\n\nNEER\n\n\u20020.40\n\n\u20020.35\n\n\u20020.20\n\n\u20130.11\n\n\u20020.70\n\n\u20130.02\n\n\u20130.16\n\n\u20020.10\n\nBER = bilateral exchange rate, NEER = nominal effective \nexchange rate.\nNote: Positive signs indicate a positive correlation between \ncurrency depreciation and changes in the sovereign bond \nspread, the latter defined as the change month on month \nin the difference between the 5-year local currency \nsovereign yield and the 5-year US Treasury yield, following \nthe definition used in Hofmann, Shim, and Shin (2017).\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n\fChallenges from rising headwinds(cid:15)(cid:15)37\n\nThese observations suggest that the exchange rate may play \na role as a transmission channel influencing domestic financial \nconditions in emerging markets. Variation in the correlation \nsign, however, raises the possibility of contrasting channels \nthrough which exchange rates affect domestic financial \nconditions. In theory, the exchange rate may affect domestic \nfinancial conditions positively through the trade channel and \nnegatively through the financial channel.1 In the trade channel, \ncurrency depreciation improves international competitiveness, \nwhich boosts net exports and eventually improves the current \naccount, which loosens domestic financial conditions. However, \ncurrency depreciation can also work through the financial \nchannel by inflating the size of foreign currency-denominated \ndebt, thereby tightening domestic financial conditions and \nworsening the economy\u2019s balance sheet. Depending on which \nof the two channels dominates, the effect of exchange rates on \ndomestic financial conditions can vary across economies. \n\nEvidence from the region\nThe trade and the financial channels both seem to influence \ndomestic financing conditions in the region. Empirical findings \nfrom Lee, Rosenkranz, and Pham (forthcoming), summarized \nin Box\u00a01.2.1, showed that changes in exchange rates affected \nsovereign credit risk premiums, which could then influence \ndomestic financial conditions. Changes to BERs against the \nUS dollar affected financial conditions largely through the \nfinancial channel, as depreciation worsened the balance \nsheets of indebted economies and hence tightened their \nfinancial conditions. In contrast, movements in NEERs \nacted more through the trade channel, as depreciation \nimproved competitiveness and therefore improved financial \nconditions. On average, the analysis found that 1% bilateral \ndepreciation against the US dollar tended to widen sovereign \nbond spreads2 by approximately 4.2 basis points, while \n1% depreciation in NEER terms tended to narrow local \ncurrency spreads by approximately 7.2 basis points.\n\nTo illustrate, the following paragraphs decompose the \n\nfactors behind the actual changes in the sovereign bond \nspread in 2018, based on the estimates reported in Box\u00a01.2.1. \nFigure\u00a01.2.3 shows the decomposition of the average \nmonthly changes to the sovereign bond spread in 2018 in \neight emerging market economies in Asia: India, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, the PRC, the Republic of Korea, \nSingapore, and Thailand.

(2018) found evidence that a stronger \ndollar was associated with lower growth in dollar-\ndenominated cross-border bank flows and lower real \ninvestment in emerging market economies. These \nfindings support the view that a stronger US\u00a0dollar \ncan have real macroeconomic effects in the opposite \ndirection to effects from the standard trade\u00a0channel.\n\nFocusing more on evidence from emerging \neconomies in Asia, Lee, Rosenkranz, and Pham \n(forthcoming) estimated a dynamic panel model for \neight such economies\u2014India, Indonesia, Malaysia, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, the Philippines, the \nRepublic of Korea, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014with \nmonthly data from December 2006 to August 2018. \nThe\u00a0following equation was estimated using Anderson-\nHsiao\u2019s instrumental variable estimation (Anderson \nand\u00a0Hsiao\u00a01982), which also addressed possible \nendogeneity problems.\n\n\u03b7\n1\u0394\n2\u0394\n\n(1)\u00a5\n\nyi,t =  \u03b1 + \n\u03b3\n\n\u0394\n\nyi,t\nCPIi,t\n\u03b4\u0394\nCPIUSt\n\n\u20131\n\n + \u03b3\n\u20131\n\n + \u03b2\n\nBERi,t\nIPi,t\n1\u0394\n + \u03b7\n2\u0394\n\n + \u03b3\n\u20131\nIPUSt\n\n + \u03b2\nri,t\n2\u0394\n + \u03b7\n3\u0394\n\n\u20131\n\nNEERi,t\n + \u03b7\nMMUSt\n1\u0394\n\n\u20131\n\n + \nVIXt\n\n\u20131\n\n + \n + \u03b5i,t\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\n\n4\u0394\n\nThe dependent variable was defined as the change \n\n3\u0394\nmonth on month in local currency sovereign bond \nspread,a whereby an increase indicated tightening \ndomestic financial conditions.

In India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, currencies \ndepreciated in both BER and NEER terms on average throughout \nthe year. As a result, the two opposing channels for the exchange \nrate effects on the spread were in play, with a tightening effect \nfrom the BER and a loosening effect from the NEER. In contrast, \nthe PRC and Singapore saw their BERs and NEERs move in \ndifferent directions in 2018, with the BER showing currency \ndepreciation and the NEER appreciation. Therefore, instead \nof causing contrasting effects, the two channels worked in the \nsame direction, tightening domestic financial conditions.\n\nIn addition to changes in exchange rates, other factors, both \ndomestic and external, were in play driving the actual direction \nof the changes in sovereign bond spreads, as captured by \nthe gray portion of the bars. However, for explaining the \ndifferences in spread movements across economies, what \nmatters are the country-specific drivers of the spreads, \nwhich included a wide range of variables from domestic \nmacroeconomic indicators\u2014such as prices, production \nactivity, and lending rates\u2014and other factors that might \naffect investors\u2019 and consumers\u2019 confidence domestically, \nsuch as political uncertainty and disasters. These other \nfactors were generally in play to explain the dynamics of \nspread movements in most regional economies in\u00a02018. \n\nThe relative importance of exchange rate movements \n\nin explaining changes in sovereign bond spreads also \nvaried depending on the conditions experienced within \na\u00a0year. The\u00a0monthly decomposition of the region\u2019s average \nspreads in 2018 showed that, within the year, exchange rate \nchanges tended to dictate the movements in sovereign bonds \nspread, especially in Q3 of 2018, when regional currencies \nwere under pressure to depreciate against the US dollar \n(Figure\u00a01.2.4). Similar observations on the opposing channels \nof the exchange rate effects on domestic financial conditions \nappeared in the months when the average changes in both \nBER and NEER were pointing at the same direction.\n\nFigure 1.2.3 highlights heterogeneity in the relative \n\nimportance of factors explaining the spreads across \neconomies\u2014and therefore cautions against drawing general \nconclusions. A\u00a0closer look at individual country analyses \nexplained in Box\u00a01.2.2 further supports this observation. \nThe\u00a0role of exchange\u00a0rates in explaining variations in \nsovereign\u00a0bond spreads differed across economies. For\u00a0example, \neffects on economies\u2019 country risk premiums associated with a \nstronger US\u00a0dollar were found to be prominent in the Philippines \nbut less\u00a0so in India. Effects\u00a0from depreciation in NEER terms \ntended to be heterogeneous across economies but with a \ngeneral\u00a0tendency to loosen domestic financial conditions.\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201330\n\n\f40(cid:15)(cid:15)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nAnalysis in Box 1.2.2 further suggests the important \npositive link between the sovereign bond spread and the \ndomestic lending rate, which highlights the connection \nbetween the spreads and domestic financial conditions. \nIn\u00a0general, widening spreads translates into a tightening of \ndomestic credit conditions. However, heterogeneity in country \nestimates presented in Box\u00a01.2.2 suggests that applying a \none-size-fits-all approach for policy prescriptions may not be \nappropriate, calling instead for country-specific action.\n\nWhat can the region do?\nDespite heterogeneity by country, there are still some \ngeneral approaches to policy that can be adopted to limit \nthe influence of adverse external conditions on domestic \nfinancial systems. Ensuring domestic financial stability is a \nchallenge, especially when external funding conditions are \nclouded with uncertainty. Experience from past crises like \nthe Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 and the global financial \ncrisis of 2008\u20132009 repeatedly highlights the importance of \nstrengthening domestic financial resilience to mitigate negative \nspillover from changes in global funding conditions. \nThe analysis here points to the role of smoothing \n\nexchange rate fluctuations to reduce uncertainty regarding \ndomestic financial conditions. To this end, both monetary and \nmacroprudential policies need to take into consideration the \neffects exchange rate movements have on domestic financial \nconditions through both the financial channel and the trade \nchannel. As such, domestic policies should be coordinated to \nensure that they are effective, avoiding potential conflict and \nundesirable outcomes.\n\nMore broadly, further developing and deepening capital \n\nmarkets in the region can provide a better environment \nfor maintaining healthy domestic financial conditions. \nExpanding\u00a0the investor base at home and further developing \nlocal currency bond markets can dampen unwanted effects \nfrom the global financial environment. \n\nTo promote better domestic financial resilience and \n\ndampen the impact of external funding conditions on domestic \nfinancial markets, all these policies should go together with \nstrengthened policy dialogue across borders to monitor \nmacrofinancial conditions, identify systemic risks, and improve \nregional financing arrangements. Capital flow management \nmeasures should also be considered to mitigate disruptive \nspillover of capital flows in an increasingly interconnected \nglobal financial system.\n\n\fChallenges from rising headwinds(cid:15)(cid:15)41\n\n1.2.2\u2002Checking for a feedback effect from sovereign bond spreads\n\nThe results from Lee, Rosenkranz, and Pham \n(forthcoming) reported in Box 1.2.1 was based on a \nsingle equation estimation that explained how changes \nin exchange rates affected sovereign bond spreads. \nThe\u00a0estimation considered the potential for solving \nthe endogeneity problem and dealt with it through \nan instrumental variables approach. Therefore, while \nthe analysis reflected how exchange rates affected \nsovereign bond spreads, it dealt only implicitly with \nfeedback loops to other variables considered in the \nestimation. \n\nTo uncover the feedback to other variables, \nthe\u00a0present analysis extended the approach in Lee, \nRosenkranz, and Pham (forthcoming) by estimating \nthe following vector autoregression with exogenous \nvariables (VAR-X), which is specified exactly according \nto the logic of equation (1) in Box 1.2.1:\n\nYt\n\nA\n\nL\n\nYt\n\n+\n\nBXt\n\n+\n\nCut\n\n \n\n \n\n(\n\n)\n\n = \n\n \nYt is a vector of domestic endogenous variables \n\n \nthat include the change month on month in the \nlocal currency sovereign bond spread, the change \nmonth on month in the BER against the US dollar, \nthe change month on month in the NEER, consumer \nprice inflation year on year, growth year on year in \nindustrial production, and changes month on month in \nthe domestic lending rate. Xt is a vector of exogenous \nexternal indicators used in equation (1) of Box 1.2.1, \nand ut is a vector of six residuals that represent \nrelevant shocks to Yt. The VAR-X is estimated for each \n\nof the eight emerging Asian economies considered \nin Box\u00a01.2.1, and the impulse responses to shocks \nthat alter the exchange rates are identified based on \nCholesky decomposition approach, which in this case \nis insensitive to variable ordering.\n\nOn average, an exogenous shock that depreciated \n\nthe local currency in BER terms by 1% tended to \ntighten financial conditions by widening sovereign \nbond spreads by 3.5 basis points in a following month \n(box figure 1). By contrast, an exogenous\u00a0shock \nthat depreciated the local currency in NEER terms \nby\u00a01% was followed by a spread narrowing by 2.0 \nbasis points and a consequent loosening of domestic \nfinancial conditions (box figure\u00a02). Qualitatively, this \nconfirmed the results reported in Box 1.2.1, which \nsaid that the BER effects on spreads in emerging Asia \nwere dominated by the financial channel, and those \nof the NEER were dominated by the trade channel. \nBox\u00a0figures\u00a01 and\u00a02 highlight, however, differences \nin the magnitude of effects in different economies. \nFirst, effects on sovereign bond spreads following a \nshock to the US\u00a0dollar exchange rate tended to be \nmore uniform across economies, with the Philippines \nhaving the most pronounced effect. Second, effects \nresulting in shocks on the NEER appeared to be more \nheterogeneous across economies. On average, however, \nresults aligned with the single equation estimation. \nVector autoregression analysis also highlighted that \nan exogenous increase in sovereign bond spreads \ntightened domestic lending conditions by increasing \nlending rates.\n\n1\u2002 Change in the spread between local currency \n\n2\u2002 Change in the spread between local currency \n\nand\u00a0US\u00a0bonds following a shock to  \nbilateral exchange rate\n\nand\u00a0US\u00a0bonds following a shock to  \nnominal effective exchange\u00a0rate\n\nAverage\nIndia\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nPhilippines\nRepublic of Korea\nSingapore\nThailand\n\nBasis points\n\nBasis points\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20138\n\n\u201312\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nMonths\n\nMonths\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n\f42(cid:15)(cid:15)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\nTraditional analysis of the mechanisms underlying \nexchange rate movements points to the positive effect of \ncurrency depreciation making exports more competitive \nand encouraging their growth, thereby positively affecting \nthe current account and thus improving domestic financial \nconditions (Fleming 1962, Mundell 1963).

Growth is set to continue slowing to the \nforecast horizon, to 1.9% in 2019 and further to 1.6% in 2020, \nas less accommodative monetary policy in the US, uncertainty \nsurrounding Brexit, and continued trade tensions weigh on \ngrowth.

All components of domestic demand in the \nUS contributed positively to growth, with consumption \ncontributing 1.8 percentage points, investment 1.1 points, and \ngovernment spending 0.3 points. Thus, domestic demand \noverwhelmed a slight drag on growth by 0.3 points from net \nexports. GDP growth in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2018 was \nstill healthy at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate (saar) of \n2.6% but slowed from even higher expansion at 3.4% saar in \nQ3 (Figure A1.1). \n\nSupporting this strong economic performance, \nconsumption held up well throughout 2018. After \ndisappointing 0.5% expansion in Q1, it jumped by 3.8% in \nQ2 and 3.5% in Q3, before slowing to 2.8% in Q4. The\u00a0trend \nin consumer con\ufb01dence also turned positive during the \nyear, particularly in the second half, when in October it \nreached 133.4, its highest reading since September 2000 \n(Figure\u00a0A1.2). Retail sales also rose through much of the \nyear, with the index hovering above 130.0.\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\nPrivate investment growth slowed in Q4 with slower \nexpansion in private inventories. Fixed investment expanded \nfurther, as nonresidential \ufb01xed investment increased by 6.2% in \nreal terms in Q4 on high growth in equipment and double-digit \ngrowth in intellectual property products. The purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index (PMI) echoed strong investment \ufb01gures \nthroughout the year with values well above 50, indicating \ncontinued expansion in manufacturing (Figure A1.2). \nIn\u00a0addition, the industrial production index shows a positive \ntrend and continues to hover above readings recorded \nin\u00a02007.\n\nHowever, economic activity tended to decelerate toward \n\nthe end of 2018. PMI readings declined from as high as \nabout 60 in September\u2013November to 57.6 in December. \nThe\u00a0decline continued further to 56.7 in January 2019, \nbut the PMI bounced back to 59.1 in February, putting \ninto question the belief of many that production growth \nwas starting to slow in the US. A similar pattern was \nobserved on the consumption side. Retail sales slowed \nin December\u00a02018 in tandem with declining consumer \ncon\ufb01dence. The\u00a0consumer con\ufb01dence index continued to \ndecline to 117.7 in January 2019 but sharply reversed to 127.1 \nin February. The PMI and consumer con\ufb01dence \ufb01gures still \nsuggest, therefore, continuing expansion of private spending in \nthe US, at least to Q1 of 2019, particularly in view of a relatively \nstrong recent outturn in the labor market.\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\nA1.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth,  \n\nUnited States\n\nPrivate expenditure\nPrivate investment\nGovernment expenditure & investment\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ = quarter.\nSources: US Department of Commerce.

A rapid increase in labor \nforce participation beginning in December 2018 took \nunemployment to 4.0% in January 2019, but the rate \neased back to 3.8% in February. The average duration of \nunemployment remained at 20\u201322 weeks in the 3 months \nto February 2019, an improvement from 23\u201324 weeks a \nyear earlier (Figure A1.3). Average worker earnings also \nrose steadily in the \ufb01rst 2 months of 2019. All in all, current \ntrends suggest that continuing income growth will lend \nsupport to further expansion in domestic spending.\n\nIn\ufb02ation continued to ease as lower energy prices \n\n%\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nbrought headline in\ufb02ation down from 1.9% in December\u00a02018 \nto 1.6% in January 2019. Meanwhile, core in\ufb02ation has \nremained above 2.0% (Figure A1.4). Headline in\ufb02ation may \npick\u00a0up with dissipation of the effects of lower oil prices, though, \nand somewhat higher core in\ufb02ation may persist given current \nlow unemployment and rising wages. That said, the in\ufb02ation rate \nis not seen rising signi\ufb01cantly in the near future, especially\u00a0as \nslowing global growth may sap some momentum in the\u00a0US.\nIn this situation, the Federal Reserve is seen to have \nless appetite for raising its benchmark policy interest rate, \nsuggesting a more gradual increase this year than last. \nThe already higher interest rate will, with the waning of \n\ufb01scal stimulus and slower growth prospects for the global \neconomy, at least tap the brakes on US growth in the months \nahead. However, continuing strong consumer con\ufb01dence, \nwage increases, and further expansion in production as \nsuggested by the PMI support a growth forecast of 2.4% \nin\u00a02019\u2014still strong but considerably down from 2018, \nperhaps partly re\ufb02ecting the 35-day partial government \nshutdown from 22 December 2018. Growth is projected to \nslow further to 1.9% in 2020. This suggests more moderate \nin\ufb02ation to the forecast horizon, projected to average\u00a02.2% \nin 2019 and 2.1% in 2020. Risks to growth projections are \nmostly\u00a0on the downside.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\nEuro area\nAfter growth slowed to 0.9% saar in Q4, full-year data con\ufb01rm \nthat growth in the euro area slowed from 2.5% in 2017 to 1.8% \nin 2018. The slowdown re\ufb02ects a broad decline in most GDP \ncomponents. Fixed investment was the exception as supportive \n\ufb01nancing conditions propelled its growth from 2.9% in 2017 \nto 3.1% in 2018, when it contributed 0.6 percentage points \nto growth. Growth in private spending weakened from 1.8% \nin 2017 to 1.3%, restrained by cautious consumer sentiment, \nbut it still contributed 0.7 percentage points to growth. \n\n\f46\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nGrowth\u00a0in\u00a0government consumption also softened, from \n1.2% to 1.0%, for a contribution of 0.2 percentage points. \nExternally, a \ufb01rm euro and slower global trade in the past \nyear weighed on growth in net exports, which dropped \nfrom 22.4% in 2017 to 4.7% in 2018, also contributing \n0.2\u00a0percentage points to GDP growth (Figure A1.5).\n\nConsistent with the weaker outturn for the whole \neuro area, economic growth is marked down for several \neconomies within it. In Germany, GDP growth dropped \nfrom 2.5% in 2017 to 1.5% in 2018 under drag imposed by the \nexternal sector. In Italy, growth softened from 1.7% in 2017 \nto 0.8% in 2018, mainly because of weak domestic demand \nand higher borrowing costs. In France, economic expansion \nslowed from 2.3% in 2017 to 1.5% against a difficult political \nbackdrop. Other economies in the region also slowed as both \nSpain and the Netherlands shaved half a percentage point off \ntheir 2017 growth rates to expand by 2.5% in 2018. Economic \ngrowth weakened in Portugal from 2.8% to 2.1%, and in \nBelgium from 1.7% to 1.4%. \n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\nThe growth forecast for the euro area as a whole is \ndowngraded to 1.5% in both 2019 and 2020, weighed down \nby weakening economic sentiment, less favorable external \ndevelopments, and sluggish growth in key trade partners. \nDomestic demand looks set to support continued growth, albeit \nat a lower rate than in 2018. Consumer spending will go some \nway toward sustaining activity, shored up by a tighter labor \nmarket and a more positive jobs outlook. Investment is also \nset to drive growth, buoyed by favorable \ufb01nancing conditions. \nContinuing accommodative monetary policy and expansionary \n\ufb01scal measures\u2014notably in France and Germany\u2014will help \nbuttress economic activity in the European currency bloc. \nEarly indicators suggest the euro area entered 2019 on \na sour note. The downbeat data observed in the past year \nhas persisted into 2019, signaling a slower growth path for \nthe region. Surveys of economic sentiment remained in \npositive territory but deteriorated notably throughout 2018, \nending the year at 107.4 in December and weakening further \nto 106.3 in January and to 106.1 in February. The PMI \nimproved slightly from 50.7 in January, the lowest reading \nsince July 2013, to 51.4 in February (Figure A1.6). After its \nsharpest plunge in over 2\u00a0years in November 2018, industrial \nproduction rebounded slightly in December but continues to \nindicate contraction. And, indeed, broad-based contraction \nwas observed in November in 11 euro economies, including \nthe 4 largest (Figure\u00a0A1.7).\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\nA tightening labor market is providing some lift to \n\naggregate demand in the euro area. The unemployment rate \nfell to 7.8% in January, the lowest since the global \ufb01nancial \ncrisis of 2008\u20132009. Unemployment rates fell in France, \nGermany, and Spain but inched up in Italy and Portugal. \n\nA1.5\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth, \n\neuro\u00a0area\n\nNet exports\nGovernment consumption\nPrivate consumption\nTotal investment\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\nA1.6\u2002 Selected economic indicators, euro area\n\nIndustrial production\n\nRetail trade\n\n% change month on month\n\n% change month on month\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n\fRisks to the outlook tilt to the downside.

Core in\ufb02ation \ninched up from 1.1% year on year in December to 1.2% in \nJanuary. Consumer price in\ufb02ation averaged 1.7% in 2018, \nwell within the European Central Bank target of below \n2.0%. The\u00a0central bank left interest rates unchanged in \nJanuary and reiterated guidance that it will keep rates \nat current levels until the end of summer in Q3 of 2019. \nEven\u00a0so, in\ufb02ation is seen to pick up only gradually as the \nyear progresses, not enough to raise the in\ufb02ation forecast for \n2019 and 2020 above this year\u2019s rate of 1.7%. \n\nIndex\n\n65\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\nprospects in the region are muted by trade policy uncertainty \nand weakening sentiment in \ufb01nancial markets. The threat of \nnew tariffs remains a possibility that could make net exports an \neven heavier drag on growth in the euro area. Disruption from a \nno-deal Brexit, or prolonged uncertainty if the matter is further \ndelayed, became more likely as British lawmakers voted down \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s proposals for a withdrawal agreement three \ntimes in January and March. The specter of a populist surge \nin May 2019 elections for the European Parliament raises the \npossibility of a Europe disunited over some members\u2019 quest for \nradical changes to institute more \ufb02exible rules.\n\nJapan\nA growth streak continued, however modestly, at 0.8% in \n2018. The year ended on a positive note on the back of a \nrecovery in domestic demand, but output contractions in \nQ1 and Q3 dragged annual growth down from the 1.9% \nrate recorded in 2017 (Figure A1.8). The performance \nwas enfeebled by weakness in the all-important external \nsector, with net exports weighing on growth in the last 3 \nquarters, and by natural disasters that disrupted activity \nin Q3. Private consumption and investment were choppy \nas slumps in 2 quarters alternated with rebounds in the \nothers. While government consumption boosted growth \nto a limited\u00a0extent, public investment dragged it down \nthroughout the\u00a0year.\n\nOther recent indicators suggest that a recovery in \n\ndomestic demand is fragile, particularly in business \ninvestment. Industrial production fell for a third consecutive \nmonth in January 2019, by a steep 3.7% (Figure A1.9). \nFurther, the Nikkei manufacturing PMI fell sharply from \n50.3 in January to 48.9 in February. This sends the index \nbelow the 50-point threshold that indicates contraction in \nmanufacturing and is the lowest reading since July 2016. \n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\nChallenges from rising headwinds\u200247\n\nA1.7\u2002 Economic sentiment and purchasing \n\nmanagers\u2019 indexes, euro area\n\nComposite purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index\n\nEconomic sentiment\n\nLong-term average = 100,\nseasonally adjusted\n\n130\n\n115\n\n100\n\n85\n\n70\n\nEconomic sentiment threshold\n\nPurchasing managers\u2019 index composite threshold\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nA1.8\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth, Japan\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nPrivate investment\nPublic investment\nNet exports\nResidual\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Economics and Social Research Institute, \nCabinet\u00a0Office, Government of Japan. http://www.esri.cao.go.jp \n(accessed\u00a08\u00a0March\u00a02019).\n\n\f48\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nContraction in January in core machinery orders, considered \na leading indicator for capital expenditure over a couple of \nquarters, similarly suggests that recent gains in investment \nmay be slipping away.\n\nOn the consumption side, seasonally adjusted retail \n\nsales declined in January by a sharp 2.3% month on \nmonth, reversing a 0.9% increase in the previous month. \nThe\u00a0consumer con\ufb01dence index, having shown a weakening \ntrend since the start of 2018, fell further in February to a \n2-year low of 40.9 on a scale of 0\u2013100 measuring consumers\u2019 \nexpectations for their living standards over the next 6 \nmonths. Sluggish spending and a pessimistic outlook \ncould re\ufb02ect concerns about job prospects, as the January \nunemployment rate edged up slightly to 2.5%. While sales \nmay surge ahead of a planned sales tax hike in October, \nand may enjoy additional support from expenditure related \nto the 2020 Olympics, prevailing consumer thrift could be \nexacerbated by the end of the year as consumers cut back on \npurchases after the higher sales tax takes effect.\n\nDespite a tight labor market, wage gains have \n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\nbeen lackluster, and price pressures have built only slowly. \nConsumer\u00a0price in\ufb02ation was steady at 0.2% year on year \nin January 2019, while core in\ufb02ation excluding energy and \nfresh\u00a0food crept up in the same month from 0.1% in December to \n0.3% in January. With\u00a0in\ufb02ation remaining well below the\u00a0target \nof 2.0%, the Bank\u00a0of Japan decided at its last meeting to continue \nexpanding\u00a0the monetary base and keep its policy\u00a0rates low, \nwith the short-term rate at \u20130.1% and the yield of the 10-year \ngovernment bond within a narrow band around\u00a0zero.\n\nMerchandise exports declined in January 2019 for a \nthird consecutive month, by 6.9% year on year, the sharpest \ndecline in 36 months (Figure A1.10). This re\ufb02ected low \ndemand for machinery and transport equipment in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Import growth also \nweakened in the same month, to 1.0%, and the trade \nde\ufb01cit ballooned from $496 million in December 2018 to \n$13.0\u00a0billion.\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\nThe Japanese economy having headed into 2019 with a \nslow start amid concerns over a global slowdown, full-year \ngrowth is expected to moderate. Consumption demand in \nearly 2019 may improve ahead of the upcoming tax hike \nfrom 8% to 10% in October, but the impact is expected to be \nsmaller than from a hike in April 2014, which was by a full \n3 percentage points. The government plans to implement \nmeasures to counter the negative impact of the hike and to \nbolster spending in 2020, which may avoid a sharp plunge as was \nseen after the 2014 hike.

The\u00a0seasonally adjusted unemployment \nrate improved from an average of 5.6% in 2017 to 5.3% \nin 2018. The Australian Industry Group\u2019s manufacturing \nperformance index ended 2018 at the threshold of 50 that \nseparates expansion in manufacturing from contraction, \nbut\u00a0it\u00a0climbed in the next 2 months to 54 in February. \n\nIn\ufb02ation declined steadily from 2.1% in Q2 to 1.8% in\u00a0Q4, \n\nmoving below the target range of 2.0%\u20133.0% set by the \nReserve\u00a0Bank of Australia, the central bank. In its 5 March \n2019 monetary policy meeting, the board of the central bank \ndecided to leave the cash rate unchanged at a low 1.50% \nto continue to support the economy. With income tax cuts \napproved by the Senate in mid-June, positive consumer \nsentiment, and a signi\ufb01cant increase in employment sustaining \nprivate spending, consumption is expected to continue as \nthe main driver of economic growth. Indications of stable \neconomic growth include expansion in manufacturing, \nmeasures of business con\ufb01dence re\ufb02ecting optimism about \nfuture economic conditions, and a robust labor market. \nFocusEconomics panelists predict GDP to expand by 2.7% in \n2019 and 2.6% in 2020, bolstered by robust commodity exports \nand favorable \ufb01nancing conditions to support stronger business \ninvestment outside of the large mining industry. \n\nNew Zealand\nEconomic expansion slowed from 4.4% saar in Q2 of 2018 to \n1.9% in Q3 with weaker exports and contraction in government \nconsumption and \ufb01xed capital formation.

The seasonally adjusted \nperformance of manufacturing index slipped from 54.8 in \nDecember 2018 to 53.1 in January 2019 but still indicated \nexpansion by staying above the threshold of 50.

The\u00a0seasonally \nadjusted unemployment rate rose from 4.0% in Q3 of \n2018 to 4.3% in Q4. On 13 February 2019, the central bank \nannounced that the official cash rate would remain at a \nrecord low of 1.75%. Consumer optimism, a low policy \ninterest rate, and only moderate in\ufb02ation continue to boost \nprivate consumption, as shown by increasing retail sales. \nPotential dampening factors are the rise in unemployment \nand a projected slowdown in \ufb01xed investment under tighter \n\ufb01nancial conditions and imminent changes to bank capital \nrequirements.

On\u00a014\u00a0December \n2018, the Central Bank of the Russian\u00a0Federation raised its key \npolicy rate from 7.50% to 7.75% on the expectation that prices \ncould spike in the wake of ruble depreciation and a 2019 hike in \nthe value-added tax. In\u00a08\u00a0February 2019, the central bank decided \nto keep the key rate unchanged as the balance of risks remained \ntipped toward in\ufb02ation. FocusEconomics panelists expect growth \nto moderate to 1.4% in 2019 with constrained oil production, the \nvalue-added tax hike, tight \ufb01nancial conditions, and uncertainty \nover economic sanctions. The panels predict growth recovering to \n1.7% in 2020.\n\nCommodity prices\nAverage commodity prices continued to rise in 2018, albeit \nat a much slower pace than in the previous year. Economic \nand geopolitical developments caused wide \ufb02uctuations in oil \nprices in 2018, taking them to 4-year highs in early October \nbefore they started declining again in November. Oil prices are \nforecast to remain below $70/barrel as upward price pressure \nstemming from reduced output by members of the Organization \nof the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is tempered by \ndownward pressure from higher output outside of OPEC and \nby global growth concerns. The food price index is expected to \nbe little changed in 2019 and to rise by just under 2% in 2020, \nowing\u00a0mainly to lower energy costs and adequate\u00a0supply.\n\nOil price movements and prospects\nBrent crude \ufb01nished 2018 at $53/barrel, or almost $14/barrel \nlower than at the end of 2017 (Figure A1.14). The US decision \nto allow eight countries to continue purchasing Iranian oil \nafter its implementation of sanctions on 4 November 2018 \nsent oil prices into a downward spiral. At the same time, the \nworld\u2019s top three oil producers\u2014Saudi Arabia, the Russian \nFederation, and the US\u2014pumped volumes close to all-time \nhighs, placing further downward pressure on prices. On the \ndemand side, concern over anemic growth prospects in the \neuro area, Japan, and the PRC weighed on prices. \n\nAfter brief respite toward the end of last year, crude oil \nprices increased throughout January and February and into \nMarch as global oil stocks shrank. Brent crude oil breached \nthe $60/barrel mark in mid-January and has stayed above \nit since then. The Brent crude average in the year to the \n\ufb01rst week of March was $61.90/barrel. According\u00a0to the \nInternational\u00a0Energy Agency, oil price increases are not yet \nalarming because the market is still getting rid of surpluses \nbuilt up in the second half of 2018, when global supply\u00a0exceeded \ndemand by an estimated 1.3 million barrels/day (mbd).\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\nA1.14\u2002 Price of Brent crude\n\nSpot\nAnnual average\n\n$/barrel\n\n146\n\n115\n\n86\n\n67\n\n26\n\n55\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\nSources: Bloomberg; World Bank.

As in the previous year, the US \naccounted for most of the increase as its crude oil production \ngrew by 1.6 mbd (with rounding) from 9.4 mbd in 2017 to \n10.9 mbd in 2018, while supply from OPEC fell by 0.1 mbd. \nMeanwhile, growth in world oil demand slowed by a quarter, \nfrom a 1.6 mbd increase in 2017 to 1.2 mbd in 2018. With oil \nsupply increasing faster than demand, global oil inventories \nincreased by 0.8 mbd in 2018, reversing year\u2019s inventory \ndrawdown.\n\nThe International Energy Agency report Oil 2019 \npredicted a gradual rebalancing of the oil market in 2019. \nGrowth in global oil demand is forecast to be 1.4 mbd in \n2019, or 0.1 mbd higher than estimated growth in 2018. \nFor world oil supply, the swing factor will still be US \nproduction. The US Energy Information Agency forecasts \nUS crude oil production to average 12.4 mbd in 2019 and \n13.2 mbd in 2020. According to the agency, growth in \ndomestic production will offset forecast decreases in OPEC \nproduction to the forecast horizon. Meanwhile, OPEC \ncontinues its efforts to drain the global oil glut and support \nprices. OPEC\u2019s oil output fell in February to a 4-year low as \nmember countries, especially Saudi Arabia, overdelivered \non the group\u2019s cutback agreement. Meanwhile, output \nfrom Venezuela and Iraq continued to decline, and 0.3 \nmbd remained offline in Libya because of a shutdown at El \nSharara, the country\u2019s largest oil\ufb01eld. \n\nOpposing factors will keep Brent crude oil prices\u00a0volatile. \n\nSupport for oil prices will come from the forecast increase \nin global oil demand, agreed oil production cuts, and \neconomic and geopolitical tensions that impinge on oil \nproduction and trade. Upward price pressure will come as \nwell from the implementation of the International Maritime \nOrganization\u2019s 0.50% global sulfur cap for marine fuels \non 1 January 2020, especially for Brent and West Texas \nintermediate crude, which have relatively low sulfur content. \nUpward pressure on Brent\u00a0crude prices will be tempered, \nhowever, by concerns about slowing global economic growth, \nfurther strengthening\u00a0of the US dollar, the resumption of oil \nproduction in Libya from El Sharara, and higher US crude oil \nproduction. The\u00a0futures\u00a0market shows Brent crude trading \nabove $60/barrel to the forecast horizon (Figure A1.15). \nBarring major supply disruptions, the price of Brent crude is \nforecast to average $62/barrel in both 2019 and 2020. \n\nFood price movements and prospects\nFood prices, as measured by the World Bank food price index, \nincreased by 0.3% in 2018 (Figure A1.16). Apart from grain, \nthe other two indexes used to calculate the index\u00a0fell\u00a0in\u00a02018. \n\n\fChallenges from rising headwinds\u200253\n\nA1.16\u2002 Food commodity price indexes\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: World Bank.

Similarly, the \u201cother food\u201d \ncategory fell by 3.2% in 2018 with a continued glut-driven \ndecline in the price of sugar, the commodity with the \nhighest weight in the index, and an easing of meat prices \nbecause of increased production. \n\nMeanwhile, grain prices increased by 10.2% last year. \n\nThe grain index trended upward in 2018, with wheat \nand maize prices higher in Q4. Wheat prices bene\ufb01ted \nfrom weather disturbances, especially in Australia, the \nRussian\u00a0Federation, and Ukraine, as did maize prices \nfrom robust demand. By contrast, rice prices dropped in \nthe second half of 2018 as bountiful harvests, competition \namong exporters, and currency movements weighed on them. \nThese\u00a0price movements have continued into 2019, pushing \nthe food price index down by 5.0% year on year in the \n\ufb01rst\u00a02\u00a0months of the year. \n\nThe latest forecasts in a March 2019 report from the \nUS\u00a0Department of Agriculture show global grain production \nreaching 2,606.5 million tons in the current 2018/19 crop \nseason, which is lower than the previous crop year estimate \nbut still higher than the 5-year average. The outlook for edible \noil remains favorable, with the US Department of Agriculture \nforecasting higher production and exports in 2018/19 and \nhigher stocks at the end of the year. \n\nAccording to a 26 February update from the \n\nWorld\u00a0Meteorological Organization, there is a 50%\u201360% \nchance that El Ni\u00f1o will recur by May 2019, though it is \nexpected to be not as strong as in 2015 and 2016. In any\u00a0case, \nit\u00a0is notable that current and past El Ni\u00f1o weather disturbances \nshow only a weak link with global food prices, as reported \nin ADO 2016: Food prices \ufb01rst dropped by 16.6% in 2015 \nbefore rising by 1.3% in 2016. With ample supplies of major \nagricultural commodities and energy prices low, the forecast \nEl\u00a0Ni\u00f1o is unlikely to cause global food prices to spike. \nIn\u00a0view\u00a0of recent deep declines in food commodity prices, and \nof mostly subdued oil prices, the food commodity price index \nis forecast to remain unchanged in 2019 before rising by 1.5% \nin\u00a02020. \n\nThere are several risks to the forecasts, key among them \n\nmore adverse weather, oil price volatility, worsening trade \nfrictions, domestic support policies, and further currency \ndepreciation hitting commodity exporters.\n\n\f\f2\n\nSTRENGTHENING \nDISASTER \nRESILIENCE\n\n\f\fStrengthening \ndisaster resilience\n\nOver the past half century, developing Asia has transformed \nfrom one of the world\u2019s poorest regions to its center of \neconomic gravity. Almost all Asian economies are now at least \nmiddle\u00a0income, yet they are also among the most heavily affected \nby natural hazards that become disasters and the most exposed \nto the consequences of climate change. More than four in five \npeople affected by such disasters from 2000 to 2018 lived in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia.\n\nAlthough advanced and developing countries alike are exposed \nto various types of disaster risk, the consequences tend to be more \nsevere in developing countries, where disasters disproportionally \naffect the poor and marginalized. Understanding and addressing \ndisaster risk in developing Asia, where it has become a growing \nthreat to development and prosperity, has thus become a critical \nchallenge in research, policy, and practice. \n\nThe causes and consequences of disasters do not exist in \nisolation, however, but are bound up instead in the ongoing \ndynamics of the economy, society, and environment in which they \noccur. As such, comprehensively understanding the impact of \ndisasters requires understanding their complexity.\n\nThe context in which disasters occur tends to be highly \ndynamic. Disasters are the result of the complex interactions \nbetween human actions and natural hazards. Many of the drivers \nof vulnerability and exposure to natural hazards can be found \nin underlying socioeconomic attributes and trends: poverty \nand inequality, demographic change, urbanization, governance \nstructures, infrastructure investments, and the unsustainable use \nof natural resources and ecosystems. Climate change and climate \nvariability intensify disaster risk by changing the frequency, \nintensity, and timing of extreme events, as well as the size of the \narea affected (IPCC 2012). \n\nThis chapter was written by Benno Ferrarini of the Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila; Thomas McDermott of the \nNational University of Ireland\u2013Galway; and Ilan Noy of Victoria University of \nWellington. It draws on the background papers listed at the end of the chapter. \nThe contribution from Charlotte Benson of the Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department is gratefully acknowledged. Other contributions \nare listed in the Acknowledgments section.\n\n\f58(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nThe impacts of disasters are highly diverse. They affect \ndifferent individuals and social groups in different ways, and \nthey may extend well beyond the here and now. When\u00a0disaster \nimpacts spill across space and time, they may be either restrained \nor amplified through social and economic networks, migration, \nremittances, and production supply chains. They\u00a0may be \ninfluenced by market mechanisms that operate through insurance \nor supply chains; government action in the form of infrastructure \ninvestment, early warning systems, and recovery assistance; \nand the actions of individuals as they relocate and migrate; \nor of communities as they reinforce social networks and build \nsocial\u00a0capital. \n\nLooking on the bright side in the aftermath of a disaster, \nthe\u00a0recovery phase is often a window of opportunity to learn \nfrom experience, mitigate future vulnerability and exposure, and \nenhance resilience. It is important, in a world where extreme \nweather events are expected to become more frequent and \nsevere, that policy makers and affected communities resolve \nto \u201cbuild back better.\u201d As this chapter shows, a new\u00a0approach \nto opportunity in the wake of a disaster distinguishes four \nmain objectives: building back for a safer community, building \nback faster to sustain individual and community well-being, \nbuilding\u00a0back more inclusively for a fairer society, and building \nback for more social and economic potential in the future. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)59\n\nNatural hazards putting \nAsia\u2019s\u00a0prosperity at risk\n\nDeveloping economies across Asia are among the most dynamic \nin the world. However, they are also among the most vulnerable \nto natural hazards, such as storms, floods, droughts, tsunamis, \nand earthquakes, and to the impacts of climate change, such as \nsea-level rise, coastal erosion, and extreme temperatures.\n\nThe impacts of disasters\u2014either direct effects that cause \n\nfatalities, render people homeless or displaced, and wreak \neconomic damage, or indirect effects that hamper economic \ngrowth, development, and poverty reduction\u2014all exhibit distinct \nrelationships with the underlying drivers of disaster risk: \nhazard\u00a0types, the exposure of population and assets, vulnerability, \nand socioeconomic resilience (Box 2.1.1).\n\n2.1.1\u2002Disasters are hazards combined with a society\u2019s exposure and vulnerability\n\nA disaster occurs when a hazard interacts with an \nexposed and vulnerable population, harming people \nand damaging physical assets such as property and \ninfrastructure (box figure). Hazards can be natural, \nsuch as tropical storms and earthquakes, or man-made, \nsuch as industrial failures and nuclear accidents. \nThis chapter focuses on disasters that are triggered \nby natural hazards. They can occur with little or no \nwarning, or they can occur slowly over a span of \ndays, weeks, months, or years. A hazard by itself need \nnot constitute a disaster, as it must combine with \na society\u2019s exposure and vulnerability to turn into \na\u00a0disaster. As such, no disaster is purely natural. \n\nTypes of disaster impact\n\nHazard\n\nExposure\n\nVulnerability\n\nMortality\n\nMorbidity\n\nDisplacement\n\nAsset damage\n\nDisaster impacts can be direct and indirect. \nDirect impacts include damage to fixed assets and \ncapital, including inventories; lost raw materials, \ncrops, and natural resources; and death, injury, and \ndisease. Indirect impacts are lost economic activity, \nin\u00a0particular the production of new goods and \nservices that will not take place following a disaster. \nLosses\u00a0can\u00a0be further divided between the short\u00a0term, \nfrom a few months up to several years, and the \nlong\u00a0term, until reconstruction and recovery are \ncomplete.\n\nImmediate\n\nShort term\n\nLong term\n\nIndirect losses\n\nLoss to well-being\n\nNotes: Hazard refers to the physical phenomena that can trigger disasters, including such weather-related phenomena as temperatures, rainfall, wind speed, and \nstorm surges, or such geophysical phenomena as seismic activity. Exposure refers to the population and economic, social, cultural, and environmental assets \nlocated in areas that experience these physical hazards. Vulnerability refers to the outcomes experienced in terms of human, social, and economic impacts from \na\u00a0given hazard and degree of exposure to hazards. Higher vulnerability permits a more adverse outcome for the same intensity of hazard and exposure.\nSource: Noy, Ferrarini, and Park, forthcoming, based on Noy 2016a.\n\n\f60(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n2.1.2\u2002Indonesia\u2019s three large disasters in 2018\n\nIn July and August 2018, the island of Lombok \nin West\u00a0Nusa Tenggara Province of Indonesia \nexperienced weeks of tremors before suffering a \nseries of devastating earthquakes. Hundreds of \npeople died, and thousands more were injured and \ndisplaced. In September, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake in \na different part of Indonesia triggered a tsunami that \nstruck the coast of Central Sulawesi. The earthquake \ntriggered landslides and soil liquefaction in several \ndensely populated districts, burying entire villages. \nIn December, Anak Karakatoa, a small volcano in the \nSunda Strait, erupted and generated a sudden tsunami \nthat hit the densely populated coasts of Java and \nSumatra on either side of the strait. \n\nIn these three events, more than 3,000 people \n\nwere confirmed dead and more than 700,000 \npeople were injured or displaced (box table). \nHomes,\u00a0schools, hospitals, irrigation systems, and \nhundreds of\u00a0kilometers of roads suffered extensive \ndamage. Along the coasts of Central Sulawesi, Java, \nand Sumatra, tsunamis destroyed fishing vessels, \nports, warehouses, and refrigeration facilities. \nInitial damage reports from the National Disaster \nManagement\u00a0Agency indicate damage and losses of \n$950 million for Central Sulawesi and $1.3 billion \nfor West Nusa Tenggara. Damage in the Sunda Strait \ndisaster was estimated at $22.7 million by Maipark \nIndonesia Reinsurance Data, a reinsurance company.\nInitial estimates suggest that growth in Central \n\nSulawesi\u2019s 2018 gross regional product slowed by \n3.6\u00a0percentage points, cutting growth by half. In\u00a0West \nNusa Tenggara, the effects of the earthquakes are \nestimated to have cut the gross regional product \ngrowth rate by 1.6 percentage points (box figure, left \npanel). In both cases, the local economies are expected \nto take several years to recover to pre-disaster trends.\nThe incidence of poverty is expected to increase in \nboth areas, to 16.4% in Central Sulawesi and 16.8% in \nWest Nusa Tenggara, reversing the trend toward lower \npoverty incidence in the affected provinces before the \ndisasters (box figure, right panel).

In Central Sulawesi, the number of jobs in \nagriculture, fisheries, and mining shrank, driving more \nworkers into the informal economy. Primary irrigation \nchannels were damaged, with immediate consequences \nfor farmers. Wide stretches of coastline were rendered \nunusable for aquaculture, and marine life will be \nslow to recover. The Lombok earthquakes had major \nadverse effects on tourism and the people employed in \nthe industry either formally and informally. \n\nFiscal adjustments will be required nationally and \nlocally to meet disaster recovery needs.

However, higher incomes and better-\nquality institutions tend to reduce vulnerability (Fankhauser and \nMcDermott 2014), with the benefits of higher income particularly \npronounced in reduced mortality (Kahn\u00a02005).\n\nWhile advanced and developing countries alike are exposed to \n\nvarious types of disaster risks, the consequences\u2014particularly in \nterms of fatalities and economic impacts\u2014tend to be much more \nsevere in developing countries, affecting poor and marginalized \npeople disproportionately. This was borne out most recently through \nthe experience of three Indonesian disasters in 2018 (Box\u00a02.1.2). \nThese general observations are reflected in the data from \nthe Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) on recent disaster \nimpacts across developing Asia, which is by far the world region \nmost heavily affected by disasters in terms of human impact \n(Box\u00a02.1.3). From 2000 to 2018, developing\u00a0Asia was home to 84% \nof the 206 million people affected by disasters globally on average \neach year. It also accounted for almost 55% of 60,000 disaster \nfatalities worldwide. The\u00a0most catastrophic disasters since 1990 \nhave caused fatalities in almost every corner of Asia, but especially \nin East and South\u00a0Asia\u00a0(Figure\u00a02.1.1). Even in global aggregates, \ncatastrophes in Bangladesh in 1991, Indonesia in 2004, Pakistan \nin 2005, Myanmar\u00a0in 2008, and the People\u2019s Republic of China \nin 2008 account for a disproportionate share of total mortality \n(Figure\u00a02.1.2). Asia also suffers 26% of the $128\u00a0billion in economic \ndamage recorded annually on average. \n\n2.1.3\u2002The Emergency Events Database\n\nThe Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), compiled \nby the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of \nDisasters, provides comprehensive information about \nthe frequency, type, and intensity of disasters in terms \nof human and material losses, with nearly global \ncoverage. EM-DAT records the number of people \nkilled by a disaster, the number of people affected, \nand\u00a0the amount of direct damage to property, crops, \nand livestock. \u201cAffected\u201d is broadly defined in the \ndatabase as encompassing everything from severe \nphysical injury to a temporary need to relocate \nbecause of periodic flooding that otherwise does \nlittle damage. However, data can be scant, especially \non damage, being available for less than 40% of the \ndisasters\u00a0reported in developing Asia since\u00a01980. \nMore\u00a0generally, disaster records before 2000 are \npresumed not to be very reliable, especially in \ndeveloping countries, because the reporting of events \nand damage is incomplete and inconsistent across \ncountries and time.\n\nEM-DAT defines \u201cdisasters\u201d as situations or events \n\nfor which at least one of the following criteria holds \ntrue: 10 or more people are killed, 100 or more people \nare reported affected, a state of emergency is declared, \nor international assistance is requested. Data users are \ncautioned that these thresholds are the same whether \nan event reaches a threshold in a territory as vast as \nIndia or as tiny as the Marshall Islands. As a result, \nevents of significance to a small country may fall \nthrough the cracks and go unreported (Noy 2015).\nIncluded in EM-DAT are disasters triggered by \n\nweather-related hazards such as floods, storms, \nextreme temperatures, droughts, and wildfires; \ngeophysical hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic \neruptions; and biological hazards such as epidemics \nand insect infestations. Also included, but not featured \nin this report, are wholly man-made disasters such as \nindustrial and transport accidents. \n\nEM-DAT data and a full description can be \n\nobtained at https://www.emdat.be.\n\n\f62(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n2.1.1\u2002Death toll from the most devastating disasters in Asia since 1990\n\nepal\n\nC\n\nC\n\nC\n\nC\n\nEarthquake\n\nEarthquake\n\nEarthquake\n\nFlood\n\nFlood\n\nfghanistan, India, Pakistan\n\nEarthquake\n\n: Bangladesh\n\nCyclones: Akash, Sidr\n\nCyclone Gorky\n\nEarthquake\n\nCyclone Haiyan\n\napan\nEarthquake and tsunami\n\napan\n\nEarthquake\n\nCyclone Thelma\n\n2018: Indonesia\nEarthquake and tsunami\n3,989 deaths\n\nndonesia\n\napua New Guinea\n\nEarthquake\n\nEarthquake and tsunami\n\nndian Ocean\n\nTsunami\nOv\n\n,\n\nyanmar\n\nCyclone Nargis\n\nThis map was produced by the cartography unit of the Asian Development Bank. \nPRC - PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nThe boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on this \nThis map was produced by the cartography unit of the Asian Development Bank. \nmap do not imply, on the part of the Asian Development Bank, any judgment on the \nThe boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on this \nlegal status of any territory, or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries, \nmap do not imply, on the part of the Asian Development Bank, any judgment on the \nlegal status of any territory, or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries, \ncolors, denominations, or information. \ncolors, denominations, or information. \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSources: Based on ADB. 2019.

However, the differing composition of damage to assets, \nand of fatalities and the number of people affected, associated with \ndifferent disaster types may be attributable as well to differing \nfrequency and predictability. \n\nWeather-related hazards are fairly predictable, facilitating \n\npreparation and effective early warning. Riverine floods, for \nexample the 2011 flood in Thailand, can be predicted well in \nadvance, sometimes by more than a month, and landfall for a \ntropical cyclone is usually known days before it happens. In these \ncases, lives can be saved by evacuating people out of harm\u2019s way \nand using specially constructed shelters. The\u00a0construction of \ncyclone shelters and the introduction of early warning systems in \nBangladesh, for example, has dramatically reduced the number of \ncasualties in these events (Haque et al. 2012). In principle, deaths \nin weather-related hazards should be almost fully preventable. \nThose\u00a0that\u00a0occur\u00a0are appropriately perceived as revealing a policy \nfailure, especially as the costs of prevention are not prohibitive. \nIn\u00a0many cases, early warning systems have the added benefit of \nreducing asset damage by enabling people to defend some assets or \nmove them out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nDisasters triggered by geophysical hazards are relatively rare, \n\nso populations and governments may tend to underappreciate \nthem and underprepare for them. Volcanic eruptions are becoming \nincreasingly predictable, albeit only by several days but enough to \nallow the authorities to issue evacuation orders before they occur. \nEarthquakes, by contrast, are essentially unpredictable, even as \nthe general seismic risk profiles of particular geographical regions \nbecome known. As such, mortality and damage from earthquakes \nis largely preventable only to the extent that construction \nstandards are made robust enough for buildings and other \ninfrastructure to withstand ground movement. This is a costly and \nchallenging\u00a0undertaking.\n\nEarly warning systems for tsunamis are feasible, but how much \n\nin advance warnings can be sounded depends on the distance of \nthreatened areas from the epicenter of the geophysical event that \ngenerated the tsunami. More generally, warnings are conditional \non scientists\u2019 limited ability to predict tsunamis precisely. \nThe\u00a0three deadly disasters in Indonesia in\u00a02018\u00a0(Box\u00a02.1.2) hit \nthe coast without any advance warning despite the introduction, \nafter the catastrophic 2004 tsunami in Aceh, of an early \nwarning system in the Indian Ocean. While technically more \nchallenging and more costly than early warning systems for \nweather events, tsunami alert systems date back to 1949, when the \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)65\n\n2.1.5\u2002 Disaster impacts normalized by \n\nGDP\u00a0and\u00a0population, 2000\u20132018\n\nDamage as % of gross domestic product\nTotal affected population as % of the whole\n\nThe Paci\ufb01c\n\nEast Asia\n\nSoutheast Asia Central Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\nNote: In EM-DAT, \u201ctotal affected\u2019 is the sum of those\u00a0injured, \nleft\u00a0homeless, or otherwise affected after a disaster. \n\u201cAffected\u201d\u00a0refers to people requiring immediate assistance during \nan emergency, either urgent medical assistance and other basic \nsurvival needs such as food, water, shelter, and sanitation.\nSources: ADB estimates using Centre for Research on the \nEpidemiology of Disasters.

An integrated system can avoid \nduplication of components and enable\u00a0effective coordination \nin the deployment of detection equipment, while participating \ncountries\u2019 interdependence and mutual oversight provide \nincentives to maintain the system.\n\nBigger impact on smaller economies \nEven for larger weather events, their geographic scale is \ntypically smaller than most countries they hit, and their direct \nimpacts in terms of human and economic losses are dwarfed \nby the population, territory, and gross domestic product (GDP) \nof affected countries. Partly for this reason, the impacts of \ndisasters tend to be more eye-opening in smaller economies, \nsuch as those in the Pacific, when expressed relative to national \npopulation or GDP. From\u00a02000\u00a0to 2018, 11% of the residents \nof Pacific island economies were affected by disasters, and \neconomic losses equaled 7% of GDP. Economic damage to \ncountries in other subregions of Asia ranges from 1% to 6% \nof GDP (Figure\u00a02.1.5).\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nThe 15 developing member countries of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the Pacific, with a combined \npopulation of 12.5 million people, are located in one of \nthe most disaster-prone regions on earth. Many of these \ncountries are exposed to tropical cyclones, frequent seismic \nand volcanic activity, and recurrent floods and droughts. \nIn addition, they face growing threats from climate change \nas rising sea levels and deteriorating coral reef ecosystems \nexacerbate their vulnerability to tropical cyclones and storm \nsurges. Disaster impacts are further compounded by these \neconomies being small, remote, and undiversified.\n\nSince 2000, disasters have affected 5.6 million people \nin Pacific developing member countries of ADB, causing \nclose to 1,500 reported deaths. They have cost these \ncountries $1.9\u00a0billion in reported damage (EM-DAT). \nA\u00a0global\u00a0estimate of life-years lost per capita to disasters \nfrom 1980 to 2012 found Tuvalu and the Cook Islands \nmost\u00a0badly affected, followed in order by Samoa, \nTonga, Vanuatu, and Fiji (Noy\u00a02016b). Less exposed in \nper\u00a0capita terms, but nevertheless still very exposed, were \nPapua\u00a0New\u00a0Guinea and the island states in the North Pacific. \nTonga, Vanuatu, and several other countries in the Pacific \ntop the World\u00a0Risk\u00a0Index, which assesses exposure to natural \nhazards, structural vulnerability, and coping and adaptation \ncapacity (Heintze\u00a0et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\f66(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n2.1.4\u2002Vanuatu and Cyclone Pam\n\nIn March 2015, Tropical Cyclone Pam left a trail of \ndestruction through the South Pacific. The effects of \nthe category 5 cyclone left Kiribati, Solomon Islands, \nand Tuvalu with significant damage, even though it \npassed far to the side from them. The worst impact \nwas in Vanuatu, where the cyclone made landfall in \nthe evening of 13 March 2015. Sustained wind speeds \nwere recorded as high as 270 kilometers per hour, with \na reported maximum gust reaching 320 kilometers \nper\u00a0hour (Handmer and Iveson 2017). \n\nEleven people were killed during the storm, \nwhich was fewer than predicted given the storm\u2019s \nferocity, in\u00a0part because of timely and accurate hazard \nwarnings and community responses (Handmer and \nIveson 2017). As the cyclone approached, the Vanuatu \nMeteorology and Geohazards Department sent \nwarnings by text message, direct phone call, shortwave \nradio, and the internet. Damage was most widespread \non the larger islands of Efate, Erromango, and Tanna. \nApproximately 65,000 people were displaced from \ntheir homes. Estimates were that 17,000 buildings had \nbeen damaged or destroyed, including houses, schools, \npublic health clinics, and other medical facilities. \nThe\u00a0tropical cyclone destroyed the vast majority of \ncrops and compromised the livelihoods of at least 80% \nof Vanuatu\u2019s rural population. The tourism industry \nwas badly affected. Arrivals by air from March to June \ndropped by 26% below the previous year, and cruise \nship arrivals by 52%, though arrivals swiftly recovered \nin the second half of the year (ADB 2016).\n\nEstimated damage and losses to the Vanuatu \neconomy exceeded the equivalent of 64% of GDP \n(ADB\u00a02016). GDP growth fell from 2.3% in 2014 to \n\n0.2% in 2015, rebounding to 3.5% in both 2016 and \n2017 (ADB 2016, 2018b). GDP was initially projected to \ndecline by more, but the large influx of external grants \nand loans, and accompanying post-disaster operations, \nsoftened the impact on the economy, allowing evidence \nof a significant economic recovery to emerge in less \nthan a year (Mohan and Strobl 2017). The trade deficit \nin goods and services widened by almost half from \nthe equivalent of 25% of GDP in 2014 to 36%, driven \nup by cyclone damage to export facilities and higher \nimports to compensate for domestic shortages and to \nsupply post-disaster operations. The budget recorded \na surplus equal to 1.4% of GDP because the bulk of the \ncyclone reconstruction was financed by development \npartners, allowing fiscal expenditure to rise only \nslightly. \n\nInsurance from the Pacific Catastrophic Risk \nAssessment and Financing Initiative, which pools \nsovereign disaster risks across several Pacific island \neconomies, paid the national government $1.9 million \nwithin 10 days of the cyclone. Subsequent financing \nand international support, however, was far more \nsubstantial. External grants rose to $75 million in \n2015, and overall financial support from development \npartners\u2014including ADB, the International Monetary \nFund, the World Bank, and bilateral partners\u2014\nexceeded $147 million. Recovery financing went \npredominantly to large infrastructure projects, \nnotably to rebuild airports and roads. As the economy \nrebounded, recovery and reconstruction projects \ncontinued, with many communities still feeling the \nimpact of the cyclone almost 4 years later.\n\nThe most severe events can have catastrophic implications for \nsmall\u00a0island countries. For example, Cyclone Pam in 2015, one of the \nmost intense tropical cyclones ever experienced in the South\u00a0Pacific, \ncaused damage and losses in Vanuatu equal to 64% of that country\u2019s \nannual GDP (Box 2.1.4). More\u00a0broadly, cross-country growth regressions \nsuggest that severe disasters slowed annual rates of economic growth \nin the Pacific by 1.4\u00a0percentage points on average from 1980 to\u00a02017. \nLittle\u00a0or\u00a0no\u00a0comparable evidence is found for developing\u00a0Asia as a whole \nor its other subregions (Dagli\u00a0and Ferrarini, forthcoming).\n\nSevere disasters can affect the fiscal and external balance sheets \n\nof affected countries. Consumption-smoothing in the aftermath of \ndisasters can generate temporary current account deficits. Similarly, \ndisasters often temporarily reduce output growth even as they spur \nincreased public investment for reconstruction and higher public \nexpenditure as well for disaster relief (Obstfeld and Rogoff 1996, \nFelbermayr and Gr\u00f6schl 2013). \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)67\n\nSamoa experienced a catastrophic tsunami in \n\nSeptember\u00a02009 that killed 147 people and affected 5,585 \nothers. International partners provided $26.7 million for \ntsunami reconstruction, and Samoa managed to raise \n$20.5\u00a0million from its own fiscal resources for disaster \nresponse. This equaled 9% of all government expenditure in \nfiscal year 2014 and left a large funding gap. As a report by the \nGovernment of Samoa noted, the recovery plan, spread over \n3\u00a0years, would cost over $100 million (Noy and Edmonds 2019).\nWith sufficient funding, recovery efforts are likely to \n\nbe successful. This is illustrated by Vanuatu\u2019s recovery \nfrom devastation caused by Cyclone Pam, which triggered \nsubstantial international financial support. The disaster \nproved timely, as it occurred just as the Sendai Framework \nfor Disaster\u00a0Risk Reduction was being signed in March 2015 \nby most United Nations member countries in a conference in \nSendai, Japan.\n\nAverage annual losses view \ndisaster costs over time\nThe historical record of disaster losses is limited and can fail \nto capture extremely rare events. A 50-year historical record, \nfor example, may very well not include an earthquake that \noccurs only once in 400 years. An alternative way of expressing \ndisaster impacts, rather than isolating losses from a particular \nevent or summing up the measured losses over a particular \nperiod, is through average annual losses (AALs). These are \ntotal expected losses annualized over a projected time frame \nof up to thousands of years. AALs are therefore the predicted \namount that countries would have to set aside each year to \ncover the cost of future disasters, assuming they received \nno international support. Another way to put it is that AALs \napproximate the actuarially fair annual cost of insuring against \nthese disasters. \n\nAs with other metrics for measuring disaster impacts, \n\nAALs expressed in absolute terms concentrate in larger \nand higher-income economies that are exposed to hazards. \nHowever, expressed as a percentage of exposed assets, they \nare significantly higher for smaller and low-income countries. \nAALs are estimated at around 0.8% of exposed assets for \nlow-income countries in developing Asia, compared with \n0.2% for those with lower-middle incomes, 0.1% for those \nwith upper-middle incomes, and 0.2% for high-income \ncountries. In\u00a0terms of regional distribution, ratios of AALs \nto exposed assets in the Pacific subregion are, at over 0.6%, \nmore than twice as high as those for any other subregion in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia (Figure 2.1.6). \n\n\f68(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n2.1.6\u2002 Average annual losses in developing Asia, by income group and subregion\n\n% of exposed assets\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nLow income\n\nLower-middle\nincome\n\nUpper-middle\nincome\n\nHigh income\n\nThe Paci\ufb01c\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\nCentral Asia\n\nEast Asia\n\nLow income: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Tajikistan.

More\u00a0than \n45% of global disaster mortality since 1990 has been \nconcentrated in just six events. However, the United Nations \nOffice for Disaster Risk Reduction has argued that mortality \nassociated with what is referred to as \u201cextensive disaster risk\u201d \nis almost unmeasured but also on the rise (UNISDR\u00a02013). \nEvents that pose extensive risk are not very dramatic or \nsevere but happen frequently: mainly flash floods, landslides, \nurban flooding, storms, and other localized weather events. \nElectrical\u00a0storms and lightning are notable for increasingly \ncausing losses from extensive risk, by sparking wildfires \n(UNISDR 2015).\n\nGlobal risk modeling rarely captures extensive risk. \nThe losses incurred from extensive risk are rarely reported \ninternationally but simply absorbed locally by low-income \nhouseholds, small businesses, and municipal governments \n(UNISDR 2009). Yet\u00a0deaths and economic losses from extensive \nrisks are mounting in low- and middle-income countries, \nas\u00a0measured on the database of the United Nations Office for \nDisaster Risk Reduction. In the past decade, losses to extensive \nrisk in 85 countries and territories came to $94\u00a0billion. \nExtensive disaster risk typically worsens inequality \nand poverty by slowly eroding development assets such\u00a0as \nhouses, schools, health facilities, roads, and other local \ninfrastructure (Gall, Borden, and Cutter 2009). As is intensive \nrisk, it is made worse by the usual adjuncts of inequality and \npoverty: weak governance, badly planned and managed urban \ndevelopment, and rural livelihoods made even more vulnerable \nby environmental degradation. As extensive risk rises, \nit\u00a0undermines efforts to reduce poverty and to achieve many \nof the Sustainable Development Goals, while the accumulating \nlosses associated with extensive disaster risk highlight that \nunderstanding and practicing disaster risk reduction has not \nbeen effective at avoiding risk generation and accumulation \n(UNISDR 2015).\n\nEvidence is mounting about the social and economic \ncosts of widespread, high-frequency natural hazards such \nas changing rainfall patterns and temperature fluctuations. \nThey\u00a0constrain human mobility (Barrios, Bertinelli, and \nStrobl\u00a02006; Henderson, Storeygard, and Deichmann 2014) and \nhuman capital accumulation (Maccini and Yang 2009, Hyland \nand Russ 2019), and can even cause conflict (see literature cited \nin Dell,\u00a0Jones, and Olken\u00a02014). \n\n\f70(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nThese different types of disaster risk call for different \nresponse strategies that follow a \u201crisk layering\u201d approach. \nFor\u00a0example, financing response to disaster risk through \ninsurance may be the most viable mechanism for large residual \nrisks that cannot be reduced or managed otherwise. In the \ncase of extensive risk, the most effective responses may be \ninvestment in improved and disaster-resilient infrastructure, \neducation and social strengthening to build community \nresilience, and improved access for vulnerable groups to market \nmechanisms such as finance and remittances. Generally, \ndisaster risk reduction is the most effective first action to \ntackle disaster risk, both extensive and intensive. These are \ncentral themes in the remainder of this chapter. \n\nEscalating risk of disaster losses\nAcross developing Asia, losses from disasters are substantial \nand continue to impede development. They would seem to \nindicate that rising incomes and efforts toward adaptation \nand disaster risk reduction have been insufficient to balance \nthe worsening of hazards and greater community exposure \nto\u00a0them. \n\nExposure to disaster risk in developing Asia is rising \n\nrapidly. This is partly just a function of population and \neconomic growth, as there are more people and built \nstructures in harm\u2019s way, but it is also a function of trends \nthat concentrate population and assets in high-risk locations, \nsuch\u00a0as the spread of coastal megacities. Some of these trends \nare particularly pronounced in developing Asia. \n\nThe most striking recent illustration of such trends and \ntheir consequences was flooding in the second half of 2011 \nthat hit Thailand, specifically Greater Bangkok. According to \nEM-DAT, this was the costliest flood ever recorded globally. \nWorld Bank (2012) estimated that there were 800 fatalities \nand $46.5 billion in losses. The direct loss of property and \ninfrastructure to the flood was estimated to equal nearly \n13% of the annual GDP of Thailand. The flood affected many \nprovinces, including commercial and industrial districts \noutside of Bangkok. It started with very heavy rains in late \nJuly and early August. Flooding started in the north of the \ncountry, causing the south-flowing Chao Phraya, the main \nriver bisecting Greater Bangkok, to overflow its banks. \nMost\u00a0of the flood impact was experienced in the last quarter \nof 2011, with the high water bulge reaching Greater Bangkok \nin early November. While the wet monsoon of 2011 was \nindeed exceptional, a lot of the damage was traceable to the \nrecent construction of many industrial estates in flood-prone \nareas on the edges of Bangkok and the consequent lack of \nflood-water retention areas (known in Thai as kaem ling or \nmonkey\u2019s\u00a0cheeks).\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)71\n\nIn addition to rising exposure, worsening disaster risk \ncan be traced to the effects of climate change and the rise in \nsea level that is threatening coastal cities and island states \nacross Asia and the Pacific. Many coastal cities in the region \nare experiencing increased flood risk from other causes \nas well, notably from land subsidence, in part a result of \nuncontrolled\u00a0water abstraction; upriver deforestation, which \nreduces the capacity of the soil to hold water; and the paving of \nonce-permeable surfaces in urban areas.\n\nMany studies project large increases in economic damage \nfrom disasters in the near future. Some studies project annual \nglobal damage from floods to increase ninefold from $6 billion \nin 2005 to $52 billion by 2050, this increase arising from \nprojected socioeconomic change alone (Hallegatte et al. 2013). \nRecent research into the effects of future sea-level rise on \ncoastal cities highlights the potential economic and population \nlosses for global megacities. One dramatic prediction for \nHo\u00a0Chi Minh City is that it will lose 41% of its area, 22% of its \npopulation, and 22% of its real gross regional product (Desmet, \nNagy, and Rossi-Hansberg 2018). Other metropolitan areas that \nstand to lose an important share of their population include \nBangkok, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Similarly, studies of future \ndamage to coastal cities around the world from storm surges \npredict very large losses in absolute terms, concentrated in \nlarge Asian megacities. Many Asian cities risk losses equal to \n2% or more of their GDP from events that threaten each city \nwith a 5% probability of occurring by 2030 (Abadie, Galarraga, \nand de Murieta 2017). \n\nProjections of future global losses from tropical storms \nindicate large increases in economic damage caused\u00a0mainly \nby increased exposure arising from socioeconomic \ntrends. In\u00a0some\u00a0cases, higher intensity comes from higher \ntemperatures in the ocean. Economic damage from tropical \ncyclones in countries that are not wealthy members of the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD) is forecast to be doubled or trebled by 2100 by \nsocioeconomic change alone, soaring from the current \n$6.7\u00a0billion per year to $13\u00a0billion\u2013$18\u00a0billion by 2100. \nThe\u00a0projected increase reflects the estimated historical \npositive elasticity of cyclone damage with respect to incomes \n(Bakkensen and Mendelsohn 2019).\n\nFactoring in the effects of climate change increases the \nprojection for cyclone damage in non-OECD countries by a \nfurther 8% on average. By contrast, fatalities from cyclones \nare projected to decline by as much as three-quarters \nwith socioeconomic change, dropping from 8,000 per year \ncurrently in non-OECD countries to just over 2,000 per year \nby 2100. The\u00a0decline reflects the estimated historical trend \ntoward fewer cyclone fatalities with rising income, as well as \nsignificant improvements in early warning systems. \n\n\f72(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nDisaster impacts and \nhow\u00a0they propagate\n\nLocal eff  ects\nSome large, geographically widespread disasters are particularly \nmemorable. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan swept from the Federated \nStates of Micronesia through Palau, the Philippines, Viet Nam, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, and Taipei,China. More often, \nthough, disasters ar e localized events with economic impacts \nlargely concentrated in the affected area. Studies that rely on \nregional or national indicators to estimate the economic impacts \nof disasters are therefore often prone to underestimate the true \nlocal impact in the localities hardest hit.\n\nThe immediate impacts of disasters on local economic \nactivity can be significant. New analysis of the local economic \nimpacts of tropical cyclones in the Philippines showed that the \nlocal effects of these storms could be substantial\u00a0(Box\u00a02.2.1). \n\nMuch of the existing literature on the impact \nof tropical cyclones has tended to focus on \nnational or regional effects. While insightful, \nthese macroeconomic studies provide little useful \ninformation for formulating policies to build resilience \nlocally. More specifically, tropical cyclones are, like \nmost natural hazards, inherently local in nature, but \nlocal impact becomes diluted if averaged out over a \nlarge regional unit of analysis. A number of recent \npapers investigated this aggregation problem when \nmeasuring the impact of tropical storms and found \nthat aggregate data tended to underestimate the \ntrue impact of these extreme weather phenomena \non local\u00a0economies (Strobl 2011, Elliott, Strobl, and \nSun\u00a02015).\n\nStrobl (forthcoming) used nightlight intensity \n\nderived from satellite images, illustrated in \nbox\u00a0figure\u00a01, as a proxy for economic activity \n(Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil 2012) and combined \nit with actual storm tracks and a wind field model to \ninvestigate the local economic impact of typhoons in \nthe Philippines. The Philippines is one of the most \nstorm-prone countries of the world, with an average of \n7.5 typhoons having made landfall annually since 1970 \n(Blanc and Strobl 2016). \n\nResults from this analysis show that exposure \nto tropical cyclones significantly disrupts economic \nactivity in the Philippines. After a storm of average \nintensity in the sample, local economic activity was \n\n2.2.1\u2002The local economic impacts of tropical cyclones in the Philippines\n\n1\u2002Night light intensity in the Philippines in 2013\n\nSource: Strobl, forthcoming.\n\ncontinued next page\n\n\f3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n2.2.1\u2002Continued\n\nreduced by 2%. After\u00a0the\u00a0most severe storm in the \nsample, local economic activity was reduced by 23%. \nOn average, these effects on local economic activity \nappeared not to persist beyond the year of the storm. \n\nThe findings can be used to construct a distribution \n\nof losses using the full set of storms hitting the \nPhilippines from 1950 to 2013. This enables an \nestimate of expected damage from typhoon intensities \nwith different return periods, or from storms occurring \nwith different probabilities. The results of this exercise \nare illustrated in box figure 2 for national losses.\n\nRelatively frequent storms, those with a 5-year \nreturn period, should be expected to produce losses \nequal to about 1% of national economic activity. \nThis rises as one considers less frequent events. \nFor\u00a0example, a storm with a 50-year return period is \nexpected to cause a reduction of national economic \nactivity exceeding 2% in the year of the storm. \nAt a regional level, the expected losses vary \nsubstantially. For instance, in Region VIII on the \nsouthern island of Mindanao, typhoons with 50-year \nreturn periods caused losses in economic activity \nexceeding 20%. In contrast, losses were relatively \nmodest in the National Capital Region and northern \nLuzon. For the capital, a storm with a 20-year return \nperiod is not likely to cause more than a 1% reduction \nin economic activity. The regional analysis, and the \nvariation of results across regions, underlines the need \nto take into account the local and regional impacts \nof disasters in disaster risk management and disaster \npreparedness, to identify hot spots for expected \ndamage and stress-test response and recovery plans \nagainst more extreme scenarios. \n\nStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)73\n\n2\u2002N-year return period national losses\n\n 95% con\ufb01dence interval\nImpact\n\nImpact (percentage points)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nReturn period (years)\n\nSource: Strobl, forthcoming.\n\nThese estimates illustrate the magnitude of losses \nthat should be expected from tropical storms occurring \nin the Philippines, both nationally and regionally. \nHowever, the expected losses estimated here are based \non historical observations. The impacts of tropical \nstorms may be expected to increase in the future \nas storms likely become more severe under climate \nchange and as communities become more exposed. \nMoreover, approximating GDP using nightlight \nintensity reflects only some forms of economic \nactivity, such as services and manufacturing, and \nlikely underrepresents other activities, particularly \nagriculture, which is very vulnerable to weather. \n\nAfter a storm of average intensity in the sample, local\u00a0economic \nactivity was reduced by 2%; after a storm of the highest intensity, \nlocal economic activity was reduced by 23%. The\u00a0cumulative \nimpact of these events in the Philippines since\u00a01992 is estimated \nto\u00a0have exceeded $11.6\u00a0billion.\n\nThese findings on the Philippines correspond to other recent \nevidence on the local economic impacts of flooding, which found \nthat large floods in urban areas reduced local GDP by 2%\u20138% \nin the year of the event (Kocornik-Mina et\u00a0al. forthcoming). \nAs\u00a0is\u00a0observed with cyclones, GDP in affected cities appears to \nbe\u00a0fully restored in the year following the flood. \n\nIt is important to note that GDP, even when measured \nlocally, is itself an aggregation and may therefore obscure \nimpacts on particular groups or individuals. This is especially \nproblematic if the impact is not distributed evenly across \nvarious groups and affects specific groups more intensely. \n\n\f74(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nFurther,\u00a0by\u00a0focusing\u00a0on\u00a0measures of economic activity, this \nanalysis omits any social, cultural, or environmental impacts \nthat do not materially affect the economy. \n\nThe relatively quick restoration of economic activity \nobserved in these studies may partly reflect that, in many \ncases, households that temporarily migrate away in the \naftermath of disasters subsequently return to their land and \nlivelihoods. Of course, this rapid restoration of population \nand economic activity to affected areas may or may not be \ninterpreted as a sign of disaster resilience. In particular, if \ndisasters tend to reoccur, hitting the same locations with high \nfrequency\u2014as for example with monsoonal flooding\u2014then \nrestoring activity to these vulnerable locations may simply put \npeople and economic assets back in harm\u2019s way. \n\nThese concerns are reinforced by the anticipated effects \n\nof climate change on the risk of extreme weather events. \nClimate change will increase natural hazard risk for particular \nlocations. An important part of adaptation to climate change, \nat least in the long run, may involve moving people away from \nlocations with worsening hazards, with consequent reductions \nin productivity (Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg 2015, Desmet, \nNagy, and Rossi-Hansberg 2018). \n\nThe evidence available to date indicates that such \nadjustment is likely to be slow because current and future \npatterns of spatial development tend to follow paths laid down \nby earlier development, and it is costly to deviate from them \n(Bleakly and Lin 2012, Michaels and Rauch 2018). Cities in \nparticular have been found to persist even in the aftermath \nof devastating shocks, including wartime devastation (Davis \nand Weinstein 2002, Miguel and Roland 2011) and large-scale \nflooding (Kocornik-Mina et al., forthcoming). \n\nPersistent effects of disasters\nEmpirical evidence of the effects of disasters on growth \nis strongest in relation to small island developing states, \nwhere major events can wipe out a large part of the economy \nand destroy critical infrastructure such as airports and \nharbors (Heger, Julca, and Paddison 2008, Lee, Zhang, and \nNguyen\u00a02018, Dagli and Ferrarini, forthcoming). However, the \nbroader empirical literature on disasters and economic growth \nis far from conclusive. \n\nWhile most disaster impacts on economic activity appear to \n\nbe short-lived, in some cases the effects may persist for a long \ntime. (Recent empirical evidence on the short- and long-run \nimpacts of disasters in developing countries is reviewed in \nSawada and Takasaki [2017].) For example, a decade on from \nthe 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan, local income per capita \nin Hyogo Prefecture was still depressed by 12% because of \nlost\u00a0employment opportunities. This reflected a regional shift \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)75\n\nfrom manufacturing to services that was directly attributable \nto the earthquake. A significant share of heavily damaged \nfactories failed to resume operations in Kobe, and there was a \nshift in employment from Kobe to nearby Osaka. As\u00a0a\u00a0result, \nthe earthquake caused a permanent loss of economic \nopportunity (duPont et al. 2015, Cole et al. 2018).\n\nThere is also evidence that poor countries can experience \n\nprolonged, slow, and incomplete recovery in the aftermath \nof severe disasters. In particular, small island states are the \nmost vulnerable because of their diminutive size relative \nto the hazards\u2019 footprint, their geographic isolation, and \ntheir lack of economic diversity. These factors mean not \nonly higher aggregate damage but less hope of recovery in \nthe short or long\u00a0term (ADB 2018c). The 2010 earthquake in \nHaiti, for example, was so catastrophic that it was found to \nhave undermined the long-term development prospects of the \nHaitian economy (Best\u00a0and Burke 2017). \n\nMacro impacts through market prices \nDisaster effects can spread across time because of permanent \nshifts in market forces. They can, for example, cause lasting \ndistortions through market concentration and collusive price \nhikes. Recent research on the impact of the 2011 Thailand flood \non the hard disk drive industry, for instance, suggests that the \ndisaster enticed market-distorting collusion in certain segments \nof the industry (Box 2.2.2). \n\nDisasters may affect\u00a0location choices for households and \nbusinesses, thus influencing real estate prices. In efficient real \nestate markets, prices provide market signals about property \nvalue and its many determinants.\u00a0However, there\u00a0is substantial \nevidence that real estate\u00a0markets are far from efficient in \nreflecting disaster risk\u00a0in their prices. A\u00a0large number of \nempirical investigations in several countries demonstrated how \npast\u00a0experience of\u00a0floods\u00a0and flood risk affected house prices \nrelatively little and not for long. Meta-analysis established \nprice effects ranging from \u20137% to +1% (Beltr\u00e1n, Maddison, and \nElliott\u00a02018).\n\nThe weak sensitivity of real estate markets to disaster risk \nhas been attributed to\u00a0their lack of liquidity,\u00a0which limits price \nmovements. This and other frictions in land and real estate \nmarkets kept commercial and residential land prices from \ndeclining despite substantial damage from the 2011 flood in \nThailand (Sawada et al.\u00a02018, Wong 2008).\n\nBy contrast, there is ample evidence that, where market \n\nfrictions are small, real estate rental and asset prices may \nreflect disaster risk well. Research on earthquake risk \naversion in the Tokyo metropolitan area, for example, found \nthat housing rents were substantially lower in risky areas \nthan in safer ones (Nakagawa, Saito, and Yamaga\u00a02007). \n\n\f76(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n2.2.2\u2002Impact of the 2011 Thailand flood on the hard-disk drive industry\n\nTo examine the impacts of the 2011 Thailand flood on \nthe\u00a0hard disk drive (HDD) industry, Nakata, Sawada, \nand Wakamori (2019) analyzed the quarterly data of \nindividual firms on HDD shipments and the average \nprices for the nine market segments of the HDD \nindustry from the first quarter of 2006 to the fourth \nquarter of 2015. In relation to the consumer 2.5-inch \nsegment, it found evidence that the three biggest \nmanufacturers colluded after the floods. The evidence \nwas higher shipments after the production plunge \ncaused by the floods (box figure 1a). Meanwhile, \nthe average price declined by only a limited extent \nand remained higher than it was before the flood \n(box\u00a0figure 1b).\n\nBy contrast, shipments of the desktop 3.5-inch \nsegment did not recover from the large drop triggered \nby the floods, and the average price returned to \nits previous level. Even in this segment, the study \ncould not preclude that HDD manufacturers \nbecame more collusive after the flood by collectively \ncontrolling\u00a0shipments. \n\nThe 2011 Thailand flood was thus found to have \nhad an impact on the HDD market structure against \nthe interests of consumers. This evidence illustrates \nthe need for public policy intervention to keep firms \nfrom unduly benefiting from disasters and thereby \nrestore their incentive to invest in risk prevention.\n\nHard disk drives shipments and average price\n\nConsumer 2.5-inch drive\nDesktop 3.5-inch drive\n\nMillion units\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n$\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\nA.

Land prices in unflooded areas increased relative \nto those in flooded areas, but this was driven mainly by \nnew entrants choosing less risky locations. While industrial \nland prices were affected, there was no evidence of effects \nfrom flooding on residential or commercial land values. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)77\n\nOther\u00a0studies found similar\u00a0short-term\u00a0moderate price declines \nfor\u00a0houses\u00a0that were associated with earthquake risk (Hidano, \nHoshino, and Sugiura 2015, Timar, Grimes, and Fabling 2018a).\nReal estate markets may fail to reflect disaster risk\u00a0for a \n\nnumber of reasons. One is incomplete information on\u00a0existing\u00a0risk, \nas suggested by studies showing sharpened risk perceptions \nfollowing extreme events. For example, Gallagher\u00a0(2014) found \nthat insurance take-up in the US spiked the year after heavy \nfloods and steadily declined thereafter. Another is the moral \nhazard associated with government interventions to provide \nprotective infrastructure and disaster recovery. A typical trade-off \ninvolves public money spent to reduce risk to people living in \nflood-prone areas, which makes them more reluctant to relocate \naway from risky areas (Kocornik-Mina et al., forthcoming).\n\nIt is notable that, despite limited liquidity and other frictions \n\nin the real estate market, once the government intervenes to \nclearly define\u00a0and constrain\u00a0the risk, the impact on real estate \nprices can be significant. For example, prices for buildings \nin Wellington, New Zealand, fell by an average of 45% after \nthey were officially declared earthquake-prone and in need of \nremediation to meet earthquake safety standards (Timar, Grimes, \nand Fabling 2018b).\n\nMacro impacts through small businesses\nDisasters can disrupt businesses by, for example, increasing \ncosts for their inputs. Smaller firms in particular will struggle \nto cope with direct damage to their buildings, equipment, and \ninventory and with other interruptions to their operations. \nIn\u00a0the aftermath of flooding in Mumbai in 2005, for example, a \nsurvey was carried\u00a0out on a randomly selected group of 627 retail \noutlets in six flood-prone wards. Only 2% of surveyed businesses \nfiled insurance claims for flood-related losses, and the average \ncompensation received by those that did was only about \u20b935,000. \nInsurance claims compensated for no more than one-third of the \nlosses on average, and only for the small minority of businesses \nthat filed insurance claims (Patankar, forthcoming).\n\nFurther evidence from surveys and interviews with flood-\n\naffected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in \nChennai found that the businesses worst affected were those \nwith annual turnover of less than \u20b9100 million (Idicheria \nand Neelakantan\u00a02016). Most of the losses incurred by \nthese businesses were damage to fixed assets like physical \ninfrastructure, with manufacturers the worst affected. \nMany lost\u00a0as well important business documents, including \nelectronically stored documents along with the electronic \nequipment. Business services were disrupted by flood damage \nto infrastructure. On average, firms made do without electricity \nfor 13 days and without water supply for 12 days. Solid waste and \nsewage issues persisted for more than 15 days. \n\n\f78(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nThe flood exposed how very much smaller businesses rely \n\non informal financing channels like friends and unlicensed \nmoneylenders. Most smaller businesses had invested their \nown money or borrowed from private sources to set up their \nenterprises. They typically had slim profit margins and limited \ncredit. Losses to the flood were amplified for such businesses \nby their lack of access to emergency funds or additional finance \nthrough official lending institutions. Although some had \ninsurance, the payouts were very low and in some cases were not \npaid for months. With production shut down, perhaps for lack \nof inputs and clients, many firms suffered significant financial \ndistress. Many could not repay their loans and were forced to \nshut down and sell their assets (Patankar, forthcoming).\n\nLow insurance penetration is a problem not only for firms \n\nin developing countries. Disaster insurance uptake by firms \nis low even in developed countries like Japan, where the \nparticipation rate for disaster insurance is only 47% for SMEs \n(Sawada\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02017). \n\nMicro impacts on households and health\nThe direct effects of disasters disproportionately hit poorer \nhouseholds and the more vulnerable members of society, \nas is well recognized. Particularly in rural areas, disasters \ncan trap households in poverty, rendering them unable to \ntake advantage of opportunities for growth. In many cases, \npoorer households are forced to migrate to cities in the \nhope of escaping an adverse economic shock. Responding \nto community surveys conducted in areas vulnerable to \nflooding across five Asian countries, 90% of rural households \nsurveyed reported that they had suffered loss of life or \nsignificant damage to assets from flooding within the past \ndecade. These rural households took more than three times \nlonger than urban households to recover financially from \ndamage caused by flooding, 27 weeks versus 7\u20138 for urban \nhouseholds (Figure\u00a02.2.1) (Laurien and Keating, forthcoming).\n\nHousehold surveys following severe flooding in Indian cities \n\nshowed that, in the absence of social protection, disaster-hit \nfamilies used up savings or borrowed at high interest rates from \ninformal lenders, pushing them further into indebtedness and \npoverty. Poor\u00a0households were disproportionately affected by \ndisasters in that they are more likely to be hit by a disaster than \nwealthier households and, when\u00a0hit, suffered greater losses \nrelative to their income (Box\u00a02.2.3) (Patankar, forthcoming; \nsee\u00a0also Winsemius et\u00a0al. 2018, Hallegatte et al. 2016a and 2017, \nSakai et al. 2017). Compounding these vulnerabilities, poorer \nhouseholds had difficulty accessing the mechanisms that were \ntypically used to cope with income shocks, notably financial \nservices such as insurance and credit (Castells-Quintana, Lopez-\nUribe, and McDermott 2018). \n\n2.2.1\u2002 Financial recovery time from last severe flood\n\nRural\n\n27 weeks\n\nPeri-urban\n\n18 weeks\n\nUrban\n\n7\u20138 weeks\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nSource: Laurien and Keating, forthcoming. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)79\n\n1\u2002 Cost of asset repair and replacement  \n\nafter flooding in\u00a0Mumbai\n\nDamage cost\n\n\u20b9 thousand\n\nDamage\u00a0cost\n\n% of average monthly income\n\n1,600\n\n1,400\n\n1,200\n\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2.2.3\u2002The impact of floods on households\u2014evidence from India\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nMumbai\nIn a case study of severe flooding in the Indian city \nof Mumbai in 2005, the administrative wards worst \naffected by flooding featured high population density, \nat 4\u20135 times the city average of 27,150 per square \nkilometer, and many households in tenements, slums, \nand other poor living conditions. The percentage \nof slum-dwelling households in these wards was \n21%\u201346%. Of the households randomly selected \nin affected\u00a0wards for inclusion in the survey, 71% \nwere classified as poor and 16% as living below the \npoverty line. Most households surveyed lived in badly \nconstructed dwellings. \n\nPoorer households reported higher intensity of \n\nflood impacts, and the losses they reported were \nmore substantial relative to income (box\u00a0figure\u00a01). \nFamilies\u00a0below the poverty line suffered losses \nexceeding a year\u2019s income from damage to assets \nthey owned, while the losses of households classified \nas poor equaled about 5 months of their income. \nOthers\u00a0reported the cost of repairing or replacing \ndamaged assets equal to 1\u20132 months of income. \nAlmost\u00a0all surveyed families covered losses out of their \nown pockets.\n\nIn the absence of adequate support mechanisms \n\nsuch as social protection or insurance coverage, \ndisasters have the potential to push poor families into \ndebt traps and chronic poverty. Reported indirect \nimpacts suggest potential knock-on effects from the \ndisaster on household welfare, health, and ability to \naccess basic services. For example, many households \nsurveyed in the aftermath of the flooding reported \nfuel shortages, garbage inside their homes, problems \ngetting electricity and clean water, food shortages, \nprice rises, and a lack of transport (box\u00a0figure 2). \nCompensation for damage from flooding came \nthrough government relief in what it called gratuitous \nrelief assistance, amounting to \u20b95,000 for affected \nfamilies to cover such immediate requirements as \nfood and clothing. The amount was uncorrelated with \nactual losses reported by families, and it covered only a \nsmall proportion of losses: 13.5% for families below the \npoverty line and 10.4% for poor families. In fact, the \ngovernment carried out no needs assessment after the \ndisaster to capture information about losses suffered \nby families. Compensation per capita was slightly \nlower for the poorest households than for others \nbecause they tended to have larger families.\n\nChennai and Puri\nWhen Chennai and Puri suffered severe flooding \nin late 2015, the houses of many poor and migrant \nfamilies were washed away or partly damaged. \nMost\u00a0families reported work losses ranging from \n15\u00a0to\u00a045 workdays and an average loss in wages at \n\nBPL\n\nPoor\n\nLIG\n\nMIG\n\nHigher MIG\n\nBPL = below poverty line of \u20b95,000, Poor = \u20b95,000\u2013\u20b915,000, LIG = lower-\nincome group earning \u20b915,000\u2013\u20b930,000, MIG = middle-income group earning \n\u20b930,000\u2013\u20b945,000, Higher MIG = earning more than \u20b945,000. \nSource: Patankar, forthcoming (calculations based on primary data).\n\n2\u2002Indirect impacts of floods (% of\u00a0households)\n\nNo power supply\n\nGarbage inside house\n\nNo clean water\n\nNo transport\n\nPrice rises\n\nFood shortages\n\nService disruption\n\n96.8\n\n94.3\n\n89.2\n\n87.6\n\n72.3\n\n71.3\n\n68.1\n\nFuel shortages\n\n58.0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n% of households reporting\n\nSource: Patankar, forthcoming (calculations based on primary data). \n\n\u20b9250\u2013\u20b9500 per day.

Considering drought, for example, rainfall in \nthe year and location of birth significantly correlated with \nadult outcomes for Indonesian women born in 1953\u20131974, with \nmore bountiful rainfall in infancy associated with better health \nand higher educational attainment and household wealth \nin adulthood (Maccini and Yang 2009). In the Philippines, \ntyphoons were linked to higher infant mortality for baby \ngirls up to 2 years after a typhoon (Hsiang and Anttila-\nHughes 2013). Hurricane risk appeared to have a significantly \nnegative impact on educational achievement in the Caribbean \n(Spencer, Polachek, and Strobl 2016). Among children who \nlost parents in Indonesia to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, \nthe older ones subsequently\u00a0completed fewer years of school, \neither because they had to assume parental responsibilities or \nbecause of trauma associated with the loss (Cas et al. 2014). \nYounger\u00a0children were less\u00a0affected. \n\nEven more troubling are findings from studies on the \n\npotential for intergenerational transmission of adverse disaster \nimpacts. Research showed that women who were exposed \nin utero to a catastrophic Peruvian earthquake in 1970 \nbore children decades later who suffered lower educational \nattainment than their peers whose mothers had not been \nsimilarly exposed (Caruso and Miller 2015). \n\nAnother recent study found that women in sub-Saharan \nAfrica who were exposed to drought in rural areas during their \nearly childhood received fewer years of formal education, were \nsignificantly less wealthy as adults, and, if the drought was \nextreme, grew to be shorter in stature (Hyland and Russ\u00a02019). \nMoreover, evidence in this study suggested again that effects \nmight be transmitted to the women\u2019s offspring, with the \nchildren of affected women more likely to be born with low \nbirth weight.\n\nAs can be seen from these examples from Peru and \n\nsub-Saharan Africa, the vulnerability of the poor is compounded \nby marginalization along various dimensions, including gender. \nExisting patterns of discrimination against women can be \nexacerbated by climate stress transmitted through income \nshocks (Miguel 2005, Sekhri and Storeygard\u00a02014).\n\nNatural hazards can stymie the formation of human capital \nthrough their effects on health. Extremes of both flooding and \ndrought have been associated with higher incidence of malaria \nand with outbreaks of other vector-borne diseases such as \nplague, Lyme disease, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, \nas well as outbreaks of various waterborne diseases including \ncholera, typhoid, and other diarrheal diseases (Hales, Edwards, \nand Kovats 2003). \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)81\n\nEpidemics in particular arise from complex interaction \n\nbetween physical, ecological, and social mechanisms. \nThe\u00a0trigger can be an extreme weather event that leaves in its \nwake deficient or contaminated water supplies, malnutrition \nbecause of disrupted food supply, human displacement, \nincreased pressure on local infrastructure and health care \nfacilities, or physical conditions favorable for pathogens and \ntheir carriers to breed. \n\nReported health impacts affecting households surveyed in \n\nthe aftermath of severe flooding in India included a notable \nrise in reported cases of diseases such as gastroenteritis and \nleptospirosis, as well as increased incidence of malaria, dengue, \nand typhoid. These impacts came immediately following the \nflood, measurably exceeding their already high prevalence \nduring a normal monsoon season (Patankar, forthcoming). \nThus, while disasters may usually appear to deliver \ntransient shocks at the macroeconomic scale, their effects at \nthe micro scale may persist over the long term, with potential \nto disrupt markets, push poorer households into debt and \npoverty, and diminish educational attainment, future earning \npotential, and long-term health outcomes.\n\nImpact on institutions, governance, and con\ufb02ict \nDisasters may similarly have indirect effects on longer-term \ndevelopment trajectories through their effects on institutions, \ngovernance, and conflict, though the evidence is difficult to \nestablish and suggests heterogenous effects (Castells-Quintana, \nLopez-Uribe, and McDermott 2017). In some cases, disasters \ncan actually improve institutions and governance by generating \ndissatisfaction with the status quo. \n\nThere is a growing literature on the relationship between \n\nweather shocks and conflict. It generally finds that weather \nshocks\u2014particularly droughts, extremely high temperatures, \nand deviation in rainfall patterns\u2014can make conflict more \nlikely and, when it occurs, more intense (Dell, Jones, and Olken \n2014). Most of the studies linking climate and conflict focus \non the effect of weather shocks on rural incomes. A drought, \nfor example, that removes jobs and hurts rural incomes may \nincrease the supply of willing combatants. \n\nIt has been suggested as well that disaster shocks can \ncreate windows of opportunity for democratic development \nas affected populations become more motivated to contest \npower (Burke and Leigh 2010, Br\u00fcckner and Ciccone 2011). \nSome historical accounts suggest that the Meiji Restoration in \nJapan, for example, was triggered by a series of devastating \nearthquakes in 1854\u20131855 (Clancey 2006). However, disaster \nshocks are also associated with a higher likelihood of irregular \nor extralegal leadership transitions, including military coups, \nsetting back democratic development and economic growth \n\n\f82(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n(Dell, Jones, and Olken 2012). The Islamic revolution in Iran, \nwhich caused a dramatic decline in incomes, may have been \ntriggered by the devastating 1978 earthquake in the southern \ncity of Tabas (Cavallo et al. 2013).\n\nThe findings from the literature remain controversial \nbecause the determinants of conflict are highly complex, \nand the potential effects of weather shocks or disasters on \ninstitutions, for better or worse, appear to depend heavily on \nthe socioeconomic, political, and institutional characteristics \nof the affected country (Waldinger 2016, Castells-Quintana, \nLopez-Uribe, and McDermott 2017).\n\nPervasive effects of disasters\nDisaster effects can spread across wide geographic areas \nthrough, for example, damage to market mechanisms, \nsuch as disruption to supply chains, and the movements of \nemployers, employees, or affected populations more generally. \nWhen\u00a0disaster strikes and impacts propagate through \nproduction networks or supply chains, the shock is felt not only \nby companies in the affected region, but also by those outside it \nand sometimes very far away. This happened in the aftermath \nof the Tohoku earthquake in March 2011, for example, and \nthe Thailand flood later that year. Both events imposed severe \nshortages on firms in the US and Europe that used inputs \nfrom the affected regions in their production processes. \nThe\u00a0customers of the Japanese and Thai firms directly hit by \nthe disaster had to slow or even stop their own production for \nlack of parts and components. \n\nNegative spillover through supply chains \nRecent empirical literature has found strong evidence of these \nsupply-chain ripple effects, using data on firms in Japan and \nthe US and on multinational companies in global supply chains. \nFor example, research on idiosyncratic shocks from disasters \nto firms in the US since the mid-1980s found that affected \nsuppliers imposed heavy output losses on downstream users, \nespecially when they produced unique inputs (Barrot and \nSauvagnat 2016). This then translated into significant losses \nthat spilled over to other suppliers within production networks. \nSimilarly, studies on the upstream and downstream impacts \nof the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami on suppliers and \nconsumers found that the transmission of the shock through \ninput\u2013output linkages caused a 1.2% decline in Japan\u2019s gross \noutput in the year after the earthquake (Carvalho et al. 2016).\n\nSupply-chain interdependencies, especially if coupled with \ncost-effective just-in-time delivery of components, potentially \ncreate greater indirect exposure to natural hazards for \nfirms not directly exposed or even located in hazard zones. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)83\n\nMoreover, the propagation of impacts can occur quickly and \nwidely in modern supply chain networks (Inoue and\u00a0Todo\u00a02018). \nBut\u00a0the\u00a0role of supply chains in either propagating or mitigating \nbusiness disruptions from disasters appears to depend on the \ncharacteristics of the supply chain. Specifically, the propagation \neffect is larger when inputs are more specific and cannot be \neasily substituted (Barrot and Sauvagnat 2016).\n\nSome research looking at international spillover found \n\nthat these supply chain effects were typically confined \nwithin the affected country. Several studies observed neither \ndownstream nor upstream propagation beyond national borders. \nFor\u00a0instance, using firm-level and supply-chain data on more \nthan 100,000 major firms around the world, Kashiwagi, Todo, \nand Matous\u00a0(2018) found the propagation effect on US firms to \nbe smaller for larger firms and for those linked into international \nsupply chains. International firms can find substitutes for \ndamaged suppliers and customers more easily than can firms \nwith purely domestic supply chains, which may explain why the \ninternational propagation of shocks is less\u00a0likely. \n\nOther studies, however, do find evidence that the interruption \n\nof supply chains can reverberate internationally. Philippine \nimports of automobiles and parts from Thailand, for example, \nwere observed to decline by more than 35% from January 2011 to \nNovember 2011, after floods disrupted supply chains in Thailand, \nthan in the same period in 2010, when there was no such \ndisruption (Haraguchi and Lall 2014). Sales\u00a0of\u00a0new\u00a0automobiles \nin the Philippines in the period consequently decreased by up to \n140,000 units, a 4.0% decline from the first 11 months of 2010.\nThe interconnected nature of supply chain networks \nhints at the potential for government responses to disasters\u2014\ntargeted, for example, at affected firms\u2014to prevent spillover \non unaffected firms and regions. Governments can leverage \nmarket mechanisms to minimize disruption to supply chains \nby facilitating and supporting the reconstruction of damaged \nproduction facilities, particularly those of smaller enterprises, \nand by fostering greater cooperation among firms and \nredundancies in their supply chains.\n\nA role for targeted subsidies? \nFirms have incentives to prepare business continuity plans \nand to cooperate with each other to find substitutes for \ndamaged suppliers after a major disaster, but room still \nexists to actively encourage and facilitate such cooperation. \nGovernment\u00a0intervention can mitigate the propagation of \ndisaster shocks by, for example, organizing emergency trade fairs \nto ease supply chain disruptions in both affected and unaffected \nareas. Similarly, governments may choose to subsidize damaged \nfirms\u2019 recovery of key capital goods if those firms are crucial \nnodes in production supply chains.\n\n\f84(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nOne prominent example of this was a policy intervention by \n\nwhich the Japanese authorities funded 75% of costs to repair \nor reinstall the damaged capital goods and facilities of groups \nof SMEs after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. For greater \nimpact, the subsidy was provided only to groups of firms linked \nthrough supply chains and located in the same industrial or \ncommercial area. Group subsidy disbursements started within \n6 months of the disaster. By 2018, \u00a5504\u00a0billion had been \ngranted through this program to 705 company groups. \n\nKashigawi and Todo (forthcoming) evaluated the impact \n\nof this subsidy and how it filtered through supply chains. \nThe study found that group subsidies particularly benefitted \nsmall recipient firms\u2014manufacturers with no more than 20 \nemployees or service providers with no more than 5 employees, \nin both cases counting employees after the disaster. Crucially, \nresearch found that, within the four disaster-hit prefectures, \nthe subsidies also benefitted firms that received no subsidy \nbut had supply chain connections to recipient firms. \nBy\u00a0contrast, no impact was found for larger recipients, \npossibly because these medium-sized firms benefited more \nfrom the support of stronger industrial, financial, and \ncommercial networks. Nor\u00a0did the study find indirect supply \nchain effects beyond the disaster-hit prefectures, possibly \nbecause those links entailed support from a larger network \nof partners. \n\nA simple cost\u2013benefit analysis for this subsidy \n\nprogram, for small firms only, estimated total benefits in \nexcess of \u00a5299\u00a0billion against a total cost of \u00a531.8 billion. \nConsidering\u00a0that \u00a5217 billion in benefits accrued indirectly \nto the suppliers of inputs to firms that received the subsidy, \nthese results seem to highlight the need for policy makers \nto incorporate supply chain considerations when devising \ndisaster recovery policies (Figure 2.2.2). \n\nMigration as an effective coping strategy \nFrom the dawn of humanity, people have coped with risk by \nmigrating away from it. Nowadays, one in three migrants \ncomes from Asia, and the countries with the highest ratio of \noutward migrants are the hazard-exposed Pacific economies \n(ADB 2018d). Both international and internal rural\u2013urban \nmigration is often driven by economic pressures and the \nsearch for more opportunity. Every year, millions of people \naround the world are forced to leave their homes after \ndisasters render them unable to sustain themselves in their \nhomes. These\u00a0pressures are particularly pronounced in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia.\n\nIn 2017, more than 18.8 million people were displaced \n\ninternally (many only temporarily) by sudden-onset \ndisasters worldwide, with East and South Asia accounting \n\n2.2.2\u2002 Cost and benefits of the subsidy program\n\n\u00a5 billion\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nDirect\n\u00a582 billion\n\nIndirect\n\u00a5217 billion\n\nBene\ufb01ts\n\nCost\n\nSource: Kashiwagi and Todo, forthcoming.\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)85\n\n2.2.3\u2002 New internal displacement  \nfrom disasters, in 2017\n\nOther regions\n7.4 million\n\nSource: IDMC 2018.\n\nEast Asia and\nSouth Asia\n11.4 million\n\nfor 11.4\u00a0million, or over 60% of the total (Figure 2.2.3) \n(IDMC\u00a02018). At the same time, concern is rising over slow-\nonset disasters, especially as they relate to climate change. \nThe\u00a0World Bank has predicted that there will be by 2050 \nsome 140\u00a0million internal climate migrants, 60\u00a0million \nof them in South Asia alone, fleeing water scarcity, crop \nfailure, sea-level rise, and more frequent storm surges \n(Rigaud et al. 2018). IDMC (2019) estimated that the cost of \ninternal displacement associated with Typhoon Haiyan in \nthe 6 months following the storm was $816 million in the \nPhilippines, where Haiyan was named Yolanda. \n\nNot always a stay-or-go dichotomy, migration is often \ntemporary or seasonal, and it is an integral part of household \nstrategies for coping with risk. Migrants\u00a0often\u00a0remain closely \ntied to the home region, for example through remittances. \nPopulation movements in response to disasters similarly span \na spectrum from forced displacement to voluntary migration, \nand from temporary and local to permanent and long distance \n(Figure 2.2.4). For this reason, numbers can be contentious, \nbut it is clear that large numbers of people move in response to \ndisasters. Regardless of the precise numbers, it is who moves \nand on what terms that is more important in determining the \nconsequences of disaster-related movement. \n\n2.2.4\u2002 The spectrum of human mobility and immobility\n\nMOBILITY\n\nIMMOBILITY\n\nMigration\n\nRelocation\n\nDisplacement\n\nStay\n\nTrapped\n\nPeople choose\nto stay.\n\nPeople\ncannot move.\n\nPeople choose\nto migrate\npermanently\nto a distant\nlocation, maybe\nabroad.\n\nPeople\npermanently\nrelocate with\ngovernment\nassistance to\nwhat is hoped is a\nless risky area.\n\nPeople\nevacuate a\ndevastated area\nand may choose\nto go back.\n\nSource: Adapted from Ober (forthcoming), originally from Rigaud et al. 2018.\n\nThe benefits of migration arise from its use as a mechanism \n\nto diversify and smooth household income. In the aggregate, \nmigration can raise average labor productivity\u2014and \nconsequently incomes\u2014when people move to locations where \nproductivity is higher than at home. This is typically so in \ncities, which are generally more productive than rural\u00a0areas. \nIn\u00a0this context, migration more generally has been shown \nto offer potentially large welfare gains to migrants and \ntheir families, as in Gr\u00f6ger and Zylberberg (2016), studying \nhouseholds hit by typhoons in Viet Nam.\n\n\f86(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nDisasters usually motivate internal, localized, and \nshort-term movement. During sudden-onset disasters, \npeople often make decisions quickly and under duress. \nThe\u00a0decisions\u00a0whether to move\u2014and who moves, how, when, \nand to where\u2014are determined by the exposure, vulnerability, \nand resilience of each household, as well as by the assets they \nown and can use to finance such decisions. Unfortunately, \nthe\u00a0people who end up displaced by disasters are often among \nthe most\u00a0disadvantaged.\n\nOn average, the poor are more likely to migrate than other \ngroups when hit by disaster. However, the poorest of the poor \nmay be unable to migrate because they lack the necessary \nsocial connections or the resources including credit necessary \nto finance such a move. They thus becoming trapped and even \nmore vulnerable to future disasters (Black et al. 2011). Droughts \nin rural Bangladesh, for example, mobilized many households \nthat were not directly affected, while the worst affected were \nless likely to migrate because their already meager financial \nresources had been further decimated (Gray and Mueller\u00a02012). \nThe most severe disasters tend to inhibit mobility, as the \ncapacity to move is reduced by the adverse shock to income, \ncredit, and wealth (Robalino, Jimenez, and Chacon 2015). \nOther factors may stifle the desire to migrate in response to \nadverse environmental pressures, such as the decision of people \nin Tuvalu to stay put and advocate change (Noy 2017).\nIn sum, migration can benefit resilience, and when \nmigration does not happen, the barriers to migration may \nfurther victimize those who are unable to move. Support \nfor greater voluntary mobility\u2014specifically to empower \nindividuals and households to move on their own terms\u2014thus \nconstitutes an important but largely neglected policy response \nto disaster\u00a0risk.\n\nRisk of unplanned migration and forced displacement \nDisasters often displace populations and destroy physical \ncapital including buildings and other infrastructure, \nheightening vulnerability to the next disaster and creating \nexposure to other risks. When disasters cause people to \nmigrate to urban areas, for example, they may face additional \nexposure to flooding, heat stress, and epidemics, particularly \nin marginal and suburban shantytowns where basic shelter, \ninfrastructure, and sanitation were lacking even before the \nmigrants arrived. \n\nGlobally, the observed increase in disaster-exposed \n\npopulations is being driven, at least in part, by high migration \nto areas at risk, particularly urban areas in flood-prone coastal \nzones. Moreover, evidence suggests that migrant families \nnewly arrived in urban areas are particularly vulnerable to \nhazards. When severe flooding hit the Indian city of Chennai, \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)87\n\nthe houses of poor and migrant families were damaged or \neven washed away, yet migrant families were denied shelter \nand compensation for lack of official documentation. Some of \nthe affected migrant families had resettled from other areas \nvulnerable to hazards (Box 2.2.3). This suggests a role for \ngovernment in planning and directing voluntary migration \ntoward areas with lower disaster risk, even if only by providing \ninformation to migrants on the relative risk at various locations \n(Waldinger 2016). \n\nDisasters that push migrants to urban areas can create \nadditional problems in the receiving localities if, for example, \ncongestion worsens or competition intensifies in labor \nmarkets or for basic amenities, potentially sparking social \ndisorder (Bhavnani and Lacina 2015, Castells-Quintana and \nMcDermott,\u00a0forthcoming). \n\nDisasters can have diverse impacts on social cohesion. \n\nEspecially where deep schisms already exist in a society, \ndisasters and migration pressures generated by them can \nperpetuate these schisms or exacerbate them (Aldrich 2010). \nSometimes, though, disasters can improve social relations. \nExamples of these dynamics are much more prevalent than of \nworsening schisms, the most notable example in recent times \nin Aceh, Indonesia. A peace accord between the Government of \nIndonesia and the Free Aceh Movement in 2005, after 30 years \nof conflict, came as a direct consequence of the destruction in \nAceh wrought by the tsunami of December 2004.\n\nThe importance of \nappropriate\u00a0policy\u00a0support \nPolicy support can make migration more inclusively available \nas a mechanism for coping with risk. It can minimize the \npotential for negative spillover caused by displacement. \nIn\u00a0particular, information on the potential costs and benefits \nof migration, and on job opportunities at destinations, can \nhelp individuals make more informed choices and improve the \noutcomes of migration (Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak\u00a02014, \nMunshi 2003). Lowering other barriers\u2014including credit \nconstraints and institutional issues related, for example, \nto land tenure security\u2014can help potential migrants make \nbetter decisions that are more likely to improve their welfare \n(Deininger and Jin 2006). \n\nPolicy intervention is required to mitigate any negative \n\nimpacts in both the sending and the receiving region. \nIn\u00a0urban areas, additional strains on urban labor markets \nand infrastructure can alarm local residents when a rapid \nincrease in population occurs, particularly if it is caused \nby a large number of migrants appearing suddenly, as can \nhappen, for example, when drought hits a nearby rural area. \n\n\f88(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nWhere arriving migrants have difficulty accessing labor \nmarkets, public services, accommodation, and other amenities, \neconomic and social problems can ensue (Castells-Quintana \nand McDermott, forthcoming). Government policies that aim \nto manage the flow of displaced people and strengthening \nabsorptive capacity at migrant destinations can help ensure \nthat migration is a risk coping strategy that broadly enhances \nthe welfare of all concerned. \n\nMore fundamentally, policy responses that build disaster \nresilience promise to reduce the extent of forced displacement \nand enable individuals and households to make choices about \nmigration that are informed and voluntary\u2014choices that \nimprove outcomes in terms of livelihoods and well-being today \nand that strengthen disaster resilience in the future.\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)89\n\nInvesting in development \nwith disaster resilience\n\nResilience begins with risk reduction, which alleviates \nvulnerability and exposure to natural hazards that threaten \nto become disasters, ranging from localized events to major \ncatastrophes. Disaster risk cannot be eliminated entirely, though, \nand unavoidable disasters can place signi\ufb01cant budgetary pressure \non governments, businesses, and individual households. Mindful of \nthe social and economic costs imposed by the disasters discussed \nabove, this section turns to the roles that governments and their \ninternational partners can play in building disaster resilience. \n\nTackling the underlying drivers of disaster risk and \n\nvulnerability requires a shift in approach toward disaster risk \nmanagement strategies that emphasize preventative and systemic \ninvestments. Resilience is a useful concept in the \ufb01eld because it has \nthe potential to facilitate a shift in perspective and practice toward \nmore forward-looking, comprehensive, and integrated approaches.\nIn addition to a conceptual shift toward resilience, a parallel \n\nneed is to explore risk management options available for local \ncommunities and individuals. After all, it is within communities \nthat disaster impacts are felt most strongly and a lot of detailed \nknowledge resides. Therefore, community action to tackle growing \ndisaster risk and mitigate impacts can be very effective.\n\nMuch progress has been made on these fronts in recent \n\nyears, with developing Asia leading the way. Governments should \ncontinue to integrate disaster risk reduction (DRR) into broader \ndevelopment policies and public investment strategies. They\u00a0can \nseek to build resilience from the ground up by supporting the \ndevelopment of market mechanisms such as insurance and \ncredit facilities, by investing directly in communities, and by \nemphasizing climate-change adaptation and disaster resilience in \ninfrastructure\u00a0development.\n\nProgress in dealing with disaster risk\nAsia has made substantial progress in mainstreaming disaster risk \ninto development plans. Over the past few decades, governments, \npopulations, and the international community have increasingly \nrecognized the need to reduce risk and enhance \ufb01nancial \npreparedness for disasters in countries across developing Asia. \nThe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 \narticulates this need and sets out key goals to this end. It identi\ufb01es \nits four priority areas for action as (i) understanding disaster risk, \n(ii) strengthening disaster risk governance, (iii) investing in DRR, \nand (iv)\u00a0enhancing disaster preparedness.\n\n\f90(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n2.3.1\u2002Asian Development Fund financing of disaster risk reduction\n\nGrowing international awareness of the need for DRR \nis illustrated by the establishment of a DRR financing \nmechanism under the 12th replenishment of the \nAsian Development Fund (ADF), covering 2017\u20132020. \nThe\u00a0ADF is the fund from which ADB provides grants \nto its 18 lower-income developing member countries.\nThe DRR financing mechanism was established \n\nto strengthen disaster resilience and help spur \nfurther investment in DRR by enhancing awareness \nof disaster risk and opportunities to address it. \nADF\u00a0donors agreed to allocate up to $200 million \nfor this mechanism under the 12th replenishment \nof the ADF, including grants for lower-income \ncountries normally eligible only for concessional\u00a0loans. \n\nAdditional\u00a0concessional loans have been made \navailable for DDR with the requirement that recipients \nprovide matching funds, to encourage countries to \ninvest in and mainstream DRR into their broader \nexpenditure. The DRR funds are used to support \nstandalone DRR projects with disaster resilience as \ntheir primary objective, DRR components of other \ngrant and loan projects, and the incremental cost \nin strengthening the disaster resilience of other \ndevelopment infrastructure.\n\nSource:\nAsian Development Bank 2019a.\n\nImproved data availability and risk analysis provide \nthe modern knowledge base from which to design effective \nsolutions and inform practical action both to address \nunderlying risk and to enhance \ufb01nancial preparedness. \nEfforts to address underlying disaster risk center on better \nmainstreaming of disaster resilience measures into broader \ndevelopment investments (Box 2.3.1). For example, from\u00a02010 \nto 2018, ADB approved 240 new development projects \nincorporating measures to strengthen disaster resilience.\nDespite recent progress, a large difference remains \nin disaster spending between ex-post crisis response and \nex-ante investment. Globally, assistance to governments \nin developing countries is about seven times larger for \nresponding to disasters after they occur than for preparing \nin advance to prevent them from happening (Kellett and \nCaravani 2013). In Asia, spending on disaster prevention and \npreparedness has risen in recent years, but the gap is still \nlarge between this and spending on emergency response \nand reconstruction relief and rehabilitation. While data \non disaster risk reduction is sparsely available, a rising \ntrend of preventive spending can be observed in relation \nto humanitarian aid, especially to Southeast Asia and the \nPaci\ufb01c (Figure\u00a02.3.1). Further closing this gap will yield \nmultiple dividends, especially when investments have \ndevelopment bene\ufb01ts beyond disaster risk\u00a0reduction. \n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n750\n\n500\n\n250\n\n0\n\n2.3.1\u2002Humanitarian aid to developing Asia\n\nReconstruction relief and rehabilitation\nDisaster prevention and preparedness\nEmergency response\n\n$ billion, 2016 prices\n\nFor disaster prevention,\nemergency response,\nand reconstruction\n\n2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\n\nCentral Asia\nEast Asia\nSouth Asia\n\n$ million, 2016 prices\n\nSoutheast Asia\nThe Paci\ufb01c\n\nFor disaster prevention and\npreparedness by subregion \n\nDisaster resilience and development\nWhile substantial funds are spent on dealing with disasters, \nthe burden imposed by these events remains heavy in many \nplaces, particularly in Asia.

In practice this \nhas meant that donor institutions are embedding disaster and \nclimate risks into development projects and programs.\n\nExamples of investments with multiple dividends are \nbecoming more commonplace, and international development \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) have taken up this \nagenda. NGOs that participate in the Flood Resilience Alliance, \nfor example, have reported engaging in various community-led \nprojects across Asia that generate additional dividends in \naddition to reducing \ufb02ood risk. One example integrates into early \nwarning systems weather boards that improve preparedness for \nextreme weather but also generate more routine bene\ufb01ts from \nbetter weather forecasting, including improved crop-sowing \ndecisions. Other examples are water resource management that \nintegrates \ufb02ood risk considerations, the construction of disaster- \nresilient multipurpose evacuation and community centers, the \nreestablishment of mangrove forests against storms and coastal \nerosion, and hydroponics projects that stabilize incomes in \nnormal times and safeguard food security when disaster strikes.\n\nLittle detailed information is available about national \nprojects designed to have synergistic multiple dividends. \nThe\u00a0few\u00a0countries that release such information rarely take it \nbeyond the \ufb01rst risk reduction dividend. Donors and some NGOs \nhave reported synergistic spending on DRR integrated with \nclimate and development concerns, and countries should follow \nsuit. Some evidence on national spending can be evinced from a \nrecent review of national DRR expenditure in the Lao\u00a0People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet\u00a0Nam in the 4\u00a0years \nto 2014. It found that average DRR-relevant expenditure in \nthe three countries\u00a0ranged from the equivalent of 0.2% of \nGDP to 1.7%, and from 4.6% to 8.9% of central government \ntotal\u00a0expenditure (Abbott 2018). \n\nFigure 2.3.3 demonstrates nascent reporting practices by \nanalyzing the reporting done through the Sendai Monitor and \nas required by all signatories to the Sendai Framework for \nDRR. Reporting covers only 2017 and the \ufb01rst half\u00a0of\u00a02018. \nCountries\u00a0are required to measure their progress against \na benchmark established using 2005\u20132014 aggregates. \nMost\u00a0countries in Asia have yet to establish this benchmark.\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)93\n\n2.3.2\u2002Assessing returns on ex-ante investment into disaster risk management\n\nMechler and Hochrainer-Stigler (forthcoming) \nreviewed the findings of a global database of 65 \ncost\u2013benefit analyses of DRR investments, of which \n15\u00a0studies (11 on Asia) can be considered to have taken \na multiple resilience dividend approach, though only \none explicitly builds on the triple resilience dividend \nframework. The dividends, presented as cost\u2013benefit \nratios, appear substantial and in line with estimates \nof benefits across other studies that do not consider \nbenefits beyond the first dividend (with cost\u2013benefit \nratios of 2\u20135:1 on average for various hazards). \nHowever, the quantification of benefits in these studies \ntends to be unreliable, which undermines confidence \nin their estimates of the multiple resilience dividend. \n\nA focus beyond the first dividend, for which \n\nprobability-based risk calculations are required, often \ninspires broader-brush estimates in response to the \nneed to gauge benefits across a number of risk and \ndevelopment variables and to aggregate them. Further, \nmultiple dividend approaches require assessments of \ninterventions with indirect or intangible outcomes, \nsuch as recreational, ecological, and social benefits, \nfor which a quantitative cost\u2013benefit analysis (CBA) \nmay be less suitable. The second resilience dividend, \nindirect economic co-benefits through unlocked \ndevelopment potential, has not been assessed as \nfrequently because data on development processes \nare collected over longer periods of time, requiring \nadditional effort and resources that are only \nrarely\u00a0available.\n\nCBA remains attractive as a tool for deciding \ntechnical points in well-defined DRR interventions, \nsuch as how high to build flood embankments. Indeed, \npotential exists to integrate the decision tool with the \nmultiple-dividend logic. IPCC (2012) differentiated \nbetween \u201chard infrastructure-based responses and \nsoft solutions such as individual and institutional \ncapacity building and ecosystem-based responses.\u201d \nSoft investments are even more difficult to assess, \nespecially using CBA. Other tools for specialists, such \nas cost-effectiveness analysis, and robust decision-\nmaking approaches may help with the challenge of \nmonetizing intangible benefits.\n\nRising demand for \u201csofter\u201d DRM investments \nhas brought to the fore decision support tools with \nstronger participatory assessments and more inclusive \nprocesses for decision-making. Approaches that \nmeasure resilience may be used to support actions \nand decisions at every stage of the project cycle, \nin contrast with decision-support tools limited to \nevaluating and selecting options. These approaches \nfocus on capacity, not outcome. Such capacity \nassessments can serve as decision support for \norganizations working in local communities to scope \nout the interactions between development and disaster \nrisk, fostering their understanding of the strengths \nand weaknesses of existing resilience before actual \nevents, helping them gauge resilience after events, \nand facilitating affected\u00a0communities\u2019

First,\u00a0some \nof the projects are themselves likely to be subject to disaster \nrisk, which affects their expected return on investment. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)95\n\nSecond,\u00a0infrastructure investments can in\ufb02uence future exposure \nto disaster risk by, for\u00a0example, altering spatial development \npatterns, especially with the construction of new roads, ports, or \nother transport infrastructure (Dietz, Dixon, and Ward\u00a02016). \n\nThe large scale of anticipated investment needs underscores \n\nthe potential for these investments to in\ufb02uence future \nexposure and vulnerability to disaster risk in developing Asia. \nMany\u00a0infrastructure projects are irreversible to a greater or lesser \nextent. This is clearly the case with major physical infrastructure \nprojects designed for long use and bearing a large initial price \ntag, making them costly to reverse. But\u00a0it\u00a0may be true as well \nfor other investments that in\ufb02uence long-term development \npatterns by creating path dependencies. This\u00a0is often the case, \nfor example, with urban planning and development, making \nsuch investments\u00a0very expensive to undo (Dietz, Dixon, and \nWard\u00a02016, Kocornik-Mina et al., forthcoming). \n\nGreen\ufb01eld infrastructure investments are natural entry \npoints for including disaster resilience in the planning process \nfrom the outset. With such investments, accounting for the likely \neffects of future exposure to disaster risk promises to be highly \ncost-effective. A recent study of road investments in Viet\u00a0Nam, \nfor example, showed that the tendency to favor already densely \ndeveloped coastal areas had signi\ufb01cant costs (Balboni 2018). \nWhile the returns on coastal road investments from 2000 to 2010 \nwere positive, a greater concentration of investment inland would \nhave offered higher returns. The\u00a0risk posed by future sea-level \nrise further underscored the inefficiency of coastal investments. \nWelfare gains of some 72% could have been achieved\u00a0by \ninvestment that avoided the most vulnerable regions. \n\nThe types of infrastructure investments for which disaster \nand climate risk assessment is most relevant can be identi\ufb01ed \nusing a simple framework that considers the following: the \nscale of the project; the extent to which the investment can \nbe expected to affect disaster and climate risk by worsening \ncommunity exposure and vulnerability, either directly or through \nits outputs; the time horizon of the investment, as longer-term \ninvestments require greater scrutiny; and the extent to which the \ninvestment is considered irreversible (Ranger and Garbett-Shiels \n2012). The\u00a0framework should also take into account the expected \nimpact of an investment that attracts further development \ninvestment into a hazard-prone area. Examples of investment \nprojects that most urgently require consideration of disaster \nand climate risk include energy generation, urban green\ufb01eld \ndevelopments, water supply and irrigation systems, and transport \ninfrastructure.\n\nWhile returns on infrastructure investments are \n\nsubstantial, especially in developing Asia, public investment \nin infrastructure projects generally raises the thorny issue of \ndecision-making rendered deeply uncertain by climate change. \n\n\f96(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nSuch uncertainty\u00a0presents an additional motivation for policy \nmakers to prioritize building adaptive capacity into human \nresources that is likely to strengthen disaster resilience under \na wide range of future climate scenarios. Uncertainty about \nthe effects of climate change on future disaster risk generally \nshifts the balance of DRM portfolios toward these soft \ninvestments, which are less uncertain (see e.g., McDermott \n2016, Watkiss\u00a02016).\n\nFinancial management of disasters\nDelays and \ufb01nancing shortfalls can considerably exacerbate \nthe economic and social consequences of direct physical \ndamage from disasters, extending the time required to bring \ninfrastructure back into use and restart service delivery, \nas\u00a0well\u00a0as stymieing efforts to rebuild for greater disaster \nresilience and to revitalize livelihoods and the economy\u2014\nthat is, to \u201cbuild back better,\u201d as the literature discusses \nit. Spending plans and goals can go awry when delayed \nrecovery and reconstruction combine with deteriorating \nbalance sheets caused by unplanned spending on \ndisaster relief, with adverse consequences for long-term \ndevelopment.\n\nGovernments are therefore working to enhance \ufb01nancial \n\nplanning for disasters, seeking to ensure that sufficient \n\ufb01nancing is available to support timely relief, early recovery \nefforts, and reconstruction, as well as to promote enhanced \n\ufb01nancial preparedness in the private sector and the \npopulation at\u00a0large.\n\nGovernments can draw on an array of instruments to \nenhance \ufb01nancial preparedness. A risk-layered approach to \ndisaster risk \ufb01nancing is widely advocated, breaking disaster \nrisk down according to hazards\u2019 frequency, or probability \nof occurrence, and the magnitude of associated losses to \nidentify the most appropriate instruments for each layer of risk \n(Figure\u00a02.3.4).\n\nThese begin with risk retention instruments for more \n\nfrequent but less damaging events, including annual \ncontingency budget allocations, disaster reserves, and \ncontingent \ufb01nancing arrangements, all of which are established \nbefore disasters strike (Benson 2016). In the aftermath of a \ndisaster, governments can reallocate budget lines or increase \ntheir borrowing to provide additional\u00a0resources.\n\nRisk transfer solutions are typically more cost-efficient \n\nsources of \ufb01nancing for medium-range risks generating \nrelatively large but less frequent losses. These instruments \ninclude insurance and insurance-linked securities, such \nas catastrophe and resilience bonds, and are taken out in \nanticipation of potential disasters. In the event of a major \ndisaster, though, risk transfer instruments are rarely sufficient, \n\n2.3.4\u2002Layered approach to disaster risk financing\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nInternational assistance\n\nRisk transfer: ex-ante insurance,\nreinsurance, and insurance-linked securities\n\nRisk retention: ex-ante lines in annual\ncontingency budgets, reserves, and\ncontingent \ufb01nancing; ex-post budget\nreallocations, borrowing, tax increases\n\nt\nc\na\np\nm\n\n \n\ni\n \nf\no\ny\nt\ni\nr\ne\nv\ne\nS\n\ny\nc\nn\ne\nu\nq\ne\nr\nf\n \nd\nr\na\nz\na\nH\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nSource: ADB.\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)97\n\nleaving governments to turn to the international community \nfor assistance. For these solutions to be effective, they need \nto be accompanied by strong and effective recovery planning \nand post-disaster budget execution, to ensure that available \nresources can be mobilized quickly and effectively. \n\nFinally, it is essential that disaster risk \ufb01nancing strategies \n\nbe designed within a broader context of disaster resilience, \nplacing primary emphasis on risk reduction to stem the \ntrend of rising disaster losses. If not, the cost of post-disaster \nresponse will place mounting pressure on government budgets, \nand disaster risk could ultimately become neither insurable \nnor transferable. In line with this, opportunities should\u00a0be \nexploited to design insurance and other instruments to \nencourage investments in risk reduction (Box 2.3.3). \n\n2.3.3\u2002Steps to developing a comprehensive disaster risk financing strategy\n\nSteps to enhance financial preparedness begin with \ndisaster risk modeling to quantify the scale of the \ndisaster risk and express it in monetary terms (see\u00a0e.g., \nStrobl, forthcoming; Box 2.2.1). Historical records of \npast disasters provide a starting point but typically \nextend back over just a few decades and therefore \noffer no instances of infrequent events not experienced \nrecently. Hazard models overcome these shortcomings, \ncombining the latest scientific knowledge on natural \nhazards with the historical record to generate catalogs \nof potential events over many years. These\u00a0catalogs \nare then combined with data on the assets and \ninfrastructure exposed to the hazards, and on their \nvulnerability, to generate loss curves expressed in \nmonetary terms. These loss curves plot probable \nmaximum losses for hazards with varying return \nperiods, ranging from annual events to rare extreme \nevents that occur perhaps only once in 500 years and \ntherefore have a very small probability of 0.2% in \nany given year. The box figure depicts a typhoon loss \nfrequency curve for the city of Hue in Viet Nam.\n\nLoss frequency curve for typhoon risk in Hue, Viet Nam\n\nTotal ground up aggregate loss (D billion)\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSource: ADB 2015.\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1,000\n\nMean return period (years)\n\nWith this loss frequency information, governments \n\ncan determine their associated explicit and implicit \ncontingent liabilities. These liabilities include the \nrepair and reconstruction of public assets and the \nfulfillment of public guarantees to provide, for \ninstance, financial backing for insurance programs \nor for lending institutions that are in danger of \nfailing because of disaster-induced defaults. Further, \ngovernments sometimes act in the aftermath of \na disaster to alleviate poverty, provide housing, \nor stimulate economic recovery. Predicting and \nquantifying all these liabilities provides to the \ngovernment a full account of them and enables it to \nadequately plan for them. \n\nThe most appropriate bundle of instruments \nfor\u00a0each country and risk profile depends on a range \nof\u00a0factors:\n\u2022  the scale of resources required at each layer of loss; \n\u2022  the required speed of disbursement; \n\u2022  the costs and tradeoffs of different financing \ninstruments for particular layers of loss; \n\n\u2022  associated incentives or disincentives to address \n\nunderlying risk and accept residual risk;\n\u2022  government appetite for risk and expected \n\ngoals and priorities after a disaster, such as to \nchannel additional resources through social \nprotection programs or to support the recovery of \nsmall\u00a0businesses;\nindividual country circumstances, such as \nindebtedness;\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  broader government economic and fiscal goals \n\nand\u00a0objectives; \n\n\u2022  access to global credit markets; and \n\u2022  the market cost of borrowing.\n\n\f98(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nFinancial preparedness nationally \nIn terms of \ufb01nancial preparedness, governments typically make \nonly limited use of disaster risk \ufb01nancing instruments set up \nin advance for disaster response, beyond practical limits on \nregular budgetary provision for relief and early recovery and \nfor other unforeseen events (for the \ufb01rst risk layer). In some \ncases, governments purchase indemnity insurance to cover a \nportion of public assets (the second layer). Such arrangements \nhave proved to be far from adequate when a major disaster \nstrikes, inevitably requiring unplanned budget reallocations. \nSuch reallocations can take time to secure, particularly if \nbudget realignment can be considered only during scheduled \nmidterm budget reviews and annual budget formulations. \nAd hoc arrangements for disaster risk \ufb01nancing, and related \nuncertainties regarding budget availability, hinder post-disaster \nplanning and the effective use of resources.\n\nRecognizing these limitations, governments have begun to \nstrengthen options for both risk retention (\ufb01rst layer) and risk \ntransfer (second layer) to enhance their \ufb01nancial preparedness. \nThe Sendai Framework speci\ufb01cally calls for the promotion \nof \u201cmechanisms for disaster risk transfer and insurance, risk \nsharing and retention and \ufb01nancial protection, as appropriate, \nfor both public and private investment in order to reduce the \n\ufb01nancial impact of disasters on governments and societies, \nin\u00a0urban and rural areas\u201d (UN 2015).\n\nThese efforts have included the increased uptake of \n\ncontingent \ufb01nancing arrangements, under which pre-negotiated \nlines of \ufb01nancing can be rapidly disbursed in the aftermath \nof a disaster (Box 2.3.4). Contingent \ufb01nancing arrangements \ntarget in particular the layer of disaster risk beyond which a \ngovernment\u2019s own contingency budget lines and reserves are \nexhausted but before insurance become cost-efficient. The use \nof sovereign and nonsovereign insurance mechanisms is also \ngrowing, though they remain relatively limited.\n\nGovernments increasingly recognize the importance of \npositioning the various initiatives and instruments in a broader \nstrategy for disaster risk \ufb01nancing. In developing\u00a0Asia, the \nGovernment of the Philippines was the \ufb01rst to establish its \nDRM \ufb01nancing strategy, in 2015. This strategy recognizes \nthat local governments and individuals, as well as the \nnational government, require sound disaster risk \ufb01nancing \narrangements. The Government of Indonesia also launched a \ndisaster risk \ufb01nancing strategy, in 2018, and such strategies \nare under development in Myanmar and Pakistan, both with \nsupport from ADB.\n\nIt is important to note that disaster risk \ufb01nancing is not \na responsibility only for the government. Toward developing \na comprehensive \ufb01nancing strategy, action needs to be \nconsidered to stimulate commercial insurance markets, \nincluding for homeowners, businesses, and agriculture. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)99\n\n2.3.4\u2002Contingent disaster financing and other financing instruments\n\nContingent disaster financing establishes preapproved \nlines of credit and grants that can be disbursed in the \nimmediate aftermath of a disaster to provide timely \nbudget support and alleviate fiscal pressures. They \ncome conditional on monitorable actions to enhance \nlong-term disaster resilience, thereby ensuring that \nunderlying disaster risk is addressed. The achievement \nof required prior actions enables disbursement. \nHowever, funds are disbursed in part or in full only \nin the event of an agreed trigger event, typically the \ndeclaration of a state of disaster in accordance with \nnational legislation. Funds can then be spent through \nthe national budget. \n\nADB has supported the establishment of disaster \n\ncontingent financing arrangements through policy-\nbased instruments in five island countries in the Pacific \nto date, with coverage for another four countries \nexpected by the end of 2019. Tonga\u2019s\u00a0$6\u00a0million \ndisaster contingent financing from ADB, disbursed \nin full just 3 days after the country was struck by \nTropical Cyclone Gita in February 2018, demonstrated \nthe rapid-disbursement feature of this instrument. \nThe\u00a0World Bank has supported the establishment of \nsimilar arrangements in the Philippines, Samoa, and \nSri Lanka. Along similar lines, the World\u00a0Bank has \nintroduced in a number of its projects contingency \nemergency response components into which \n\nuncommitted project funds can be reallocated \nto finance urgent needs in the event of a crisis \nor emergency, including a disaster triggered by a \nnatural\u00a0hazard.\n\nDevelopment partners have formulated financing \ninstruments to make more resources available for more \ntraditional emergency assistance loans and grants \noffered in the aftermath of disaster. In Asia\u00a0and the \nPacific, ADB piloted the Disaster Response Facility \nunder the eleventh replenishment of the Asian \nDevelopment Fund, 2013\u20132016 and regularized it \nunder the twelfth replenishment. It provides countries \neligible for only concessional assistance up to twice \ntheir annual country allocation for use in response to \ndisasters triggered by natural hazards. The World\u00a0Bank \noffers similar support, including in response to \ndisasters, to the same set of countries through its crisis \nresponse window. The International Monetary Fund \noffers support to the balance of payments, including \nafter a disaster, to all its member countries through its \nrapid financing instrument and its corresponding rapid \ncredit facility for low-income countries.\n\nSources:\nAsian Development Bank 2019a; IMF 2018, 2019; and \n\nWorld\u00a0Bank 2017.\n\nThis\u00a0can be achieved through legislative and regulatory \nmeasures, improved supervision, \ufb01nancial literacy campaigns, \nand in some cases direct subsidies. Also useful is support for \nunderlying disaster risk modeling and for technical structuring \nof insurance products.\n\nEnhancing \ufb01nancial capacity in poorer households\nAccess to formal \ufb01nancial services remains limited in \nmany economies in developing Asia, especially for the \npoor. Problems\u00a0the poor face in accessing \ufb01nancial services \nimpede their adoption of efficient risk coping strategies, with \nimplications for poverty reduction and development more \ngenerally, as well as for vulnerability to natural hazards.\n\nWhile many advance risk management strategies, such\u00a0as \n\ninvestment in disaster-proof housing or disaster insurance, \nare\u00a0cost-effective ways to contain disaster losses (World Bank \nand United Nations 2010), these mechanisms are often absent \nin developing countries, or they are available only to people \nwho are better off. \n\n\f100(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nWhere advance protection is unavailable, households \nattempt to smooth consumption following disasters, using a \nrange of coping responses dependent on their own resources \nand those of their community (Sawada and Shimizutani 2008, \nSawada 2007). Self-reliance can mean reducing nonessential \nconsumption expenditure, spending previously accumulated \nsavings, selling physical assets, taking any additional work that \nis available, using informal credit, obtaining emergency public \ntransfers, and receiving private transfers and credits from the \nextended family network, friends, and neighbors.\n\nInformal, community-based coping mechanisms are often \n\nwell developed in poorer communities (Collier, Conway, and \nVenables 2008, Ligon 2008). These informal risk-coping \nmechanisms have been shown to be effective in dealing \nwith isolated shocks to individuals, as evidenced by data on \nhouseholds in Viet Nam (Sawada, Nakata, and Kotera 2017). \nSimilarly, remittances can allow consumption smoothing \nand \ufb01nance home reconstruction. In general, remittances are \ntransferred more rapidly and efficiently than formal\u00a0relief \nefforts, allowing households to recover more quickly, as \nillustrated in a number of case studies, including in Pakistan \nafter an earthquake in 2005, in Samoa after a tsunami in\u00a02009, \nand in Sri Lanka after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Some\u00a0of \nthese gains can be substantial, with one study \ufb01nding that \n\ufb01nancial remittances compensated for nearly 65% of income \nlost to rainfall shocks in the Philippines (Yang and Choi 2007). \nHowever, informal coping mechanisms tend to fail in the \nface of the relatively widespread destruction caused by larger \ndisasters. This is especially true if the coping mechanism relies \non neighbors or other households who were similarly hit by the \ndisaster. Some studies found that remittances often reinforced \nexisting inequality, as most remittances reached those in the \ncommunity who were already better off (Le D\u00e9 et al. 2015). \nStudies in India, Pakistan, and Thailand showed that \n\ufb01nancially constrained households employed various coping \nstrategies after disasters struck, some of which were inefficient, \nsuch as selling productive assets (Dercon 2002), providing \nmore paid labor only to force down wages (Kochar 1999), \nsending children to work rather than to school (Jacoby and \nSkou\ufb01as\u00a01997, Sawada and Lokshin 2009), or borrowing at \nhigh interest from informal lenders (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2011). \nThese risk management strategies undermined investment \nand growth and aggravated poverty (Elbers, Gunning, and \nKinsey\u00a02007).\n\nIn addition to challenges poorer households face in coping \n\nwith risk, disasters can affect individual risk perceptions \nand risk aversion, with consequent effects for long-term \ndevelopment. A number of studies have shown how disaster-hit \npopulations became more risk averse following, for example, \nthe direct experience of a \ufb02ood or earthquake in Indonesia \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)101\n\n(Cameron and Shah 2015) and the 2004 tsunami in Thailand \n(Cassar, Healy, and von Kessler 2017). Similarly, studies using \ndata from diverse locations and situations\u2014a village in the \nPhilippines that was hit by \ufb02ooding in 2012 and a city in Japan \nfollowing the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami\u2014found \nthat being hit by disaster made individuals signi\ufb01cantly more \nfocused on the present than were those unaffected by the \ndisaster, favoring payoffs that came sooner out of doubt for the \nfuture (Sawada and Kuroishi 2015a, 2015b). \n\nThe effects of disasters on individual preferences suggest \n\nthat one-off shocks can have long-lasting consequences for \ndevelopment and poverty (Sawada 2017). Relaxing credit and \n\ufb01nancial constraints on the poor could therefore do more than \nhelp them cope better with risk, encouraging them to take on \nriskier investments that have potential to be more productive \n(Castells-Quintana, Lopez-Uribe, and McDermott 2018). \nThese\u00a0\ufb01ndings underline the scope for policy intervention to \nimprove access to \ufb01nancial services and to support temporary \nlabor migration, toward distributing more widely the bene\ufb01ts \nof these effective market mechanisms.\n\nDisaster insurance to manage disaster risk\nInsurance against disasters arising from natural hazards is \na useful tool to manage climate risk and could, if carefully \nimplemented, make poor and vulnerable communities more \nresilient. However, access to commercial insurance against \ndisasters is limited and unevenly distributed for several \nreasons, including the technical challenge of designing \ninsurance products that are affordable and suitable.\n\nIn low-income countries, more than 95% of all losses from \n\nweather and climate hazards were uninsured (Golnaraghi, \nSurminski, and Schanz 2016). Just 6% of losses in \ufb02oods in \nKerala in 2018 were insured, for example, while payouts after \nthe 2018 earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi were reported \nas negligible despite substantial damage (Aon Ben\ufb01eld 2019). \nSimilarly, more than 90% of the affected families surveyed \nafter \ufb02oods in Mumbai, Chennai, and Puri did not have any \nform of insurance, and those who did suffered long delays for \npaltry settlements (Patankar, forthcoming).\n\nThe bene\ufb01ts of insurance are clear: pooling and \n\ntransferring risks to \ufb01nancial markets, enabling fairly risk-free \ninvestment, providing incentives for risk reduction, preventing \nhardship, and making post-disaster support more predictable. \nThese features of insurance can alleviate the immediate \nwelfare impacts caused by disasters and contain disruption to \nstate budgets (Hallegatte 2014, Clarke and Dercon 2016). \n\n\f102(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nRecent years have seen the introduction of new insurance \n\ndesigns, especially across developing Asia, and a shift from \ntraditional indemnity-based policies toward indexed insurance \n(Box\u00a02.3.5). Microinsurance and the bundling of insurance with \ncredit can confer additional advantages, as they not only enable \nbetter risk management but also render individuals more \ncreditworthy and promote investment in productive assets that \nmay otherwise be too risky. \n\nAt the same time, advances in disaster risk modeling \nfacilitate more accurate pricing of risk transfer instruments. \nAs\u00a0margins of uncertainty built into insurance premiums \nbecome narrower, premiums become more affordable. \nInnovations in parametric insurance\u2014which pays \ncompensation following the tripping of agreed triggers that are \nreadily measured, such as maximum wind speed or millimeters \nof precipitation, rather than for actual loss\u2014mean lower costs \nfor damage assessment and therefore further reductions in \npremium prices, as well as quicker settlements.\n\nProgress is being made in establishing regional parametric \ninsurance pools, which offer opportunities to reduce premiums \nthrough a number of mechanisms (ADB 2018e):\n\n(i) Diversifying risk reduces volatility in losses \n\nexperienced by the group. \n\n(ii) Absorbing the \ufb01rst layer of loss from pool reserves \nreduces the cost of the reinsurance required to \nprotect the pool, as does collective bargaining when \nnegotiating reinsurance. \n\n(iii) Shared administrative costs make the creation and \n\nmanagement of the pool more affordable. \n\nA regional sovereign disaster insurance pool was launched \n\nunder the second phase of the Paci\ufb01c Catastrophe Risk \nAssessment and Financing Initiative in 2017. A pool is planned \nfor several countries under the Southeast Asia Disaster\u00a0Risk \nInsurance Facility. A city disaster insurance pool is currently \nunder development in the Philippines with support from\u00a0ADB. \nSome subnational governments have entered into contracts \ndirectly with insurance companies, an example of which is \nSwiss\u00a0Reinsurance Company Limited parametric insurance \nissued to PRC provincial governments in Guangdong and \nHeilongjiang.\n\nA range of nonsovereign products is also being piloted \nand launched. The PRC, which has subsidized agricultural \ninsurance since the 1980s, is now one of the world\u2019s largest \nagricultural insurance markets, and a substantial subsidized \nagricultural insurance market exists in India as well. In \nIndonesia, insurance companies\u2019 compulsory cession of \nearthquake risk to a specialist earthquake reinsurer has been \nin force since 2004.\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)103\n\nRemaining challenges to greater \ndisaster\u00a0insurance penetration\nWhile observed trends indicate a growing role for insurance \nas part of broader DRM strategies, a number of challenges \nremain. Most straightforward are the standard concerns \nof traditional indemnity insurers over moral hazard and \nadverse selection. For example, Adachi et al. (2016) found that \ncommercial property insurance subscription before the 2011 \nThailand \ufb02ood was systematically higher among \ufb01rms located \nin the areas directly affected by the \ufb02ood than elsewhere, \nindicating adverse selection. Moreover, the study showed \nthat insured \ufb01rms and those receiving business interruption \npayouts had lower production and employment after the \ufb02ood, \nsuggesting a moral hazard. Concerns about adverse selection \nand moral hazard may be particularly pronounced when \ncoverage for small policyholders, such as farmers and smaller \nbusinesses, makes observing mitigation efforts and assessing \nlosses expensive. \n\nIndexed insurance, under which claim payments are \ntriggered by an indexed event such as precipitation below \nsome prede\ufb01ned threshold for drought insurance, offers an \nalternative as it overcomes concerns about moral hazard \nwhile reducing monitoring costs (Clarke and Grenham 2013). \nIndexed\u00a0coverage can also facilitate accelerated claim payment, \nwhich is important especially for poor households. \n\nIndexed insurance is bene\ufb01cial, though, only if the index \ncorrelates closely with actual damage. Basis risk\u2014a mismatch \nbetween the triggering index and actual damage\u2014can be \nsigni\ufb01cant, making insurance more like a lottery than a \nmechanism to transfer risk. \n\nAn especially problematic situation is when indexed \n\nmicroinsurance for vulnerable households leaves them \nuncompensated for damage and disappointed, because the \nindex did not trigger a payment. Signi\ufb01cant basis risk of this \nkind can erode trust in insurance companies and suppress \ndemand for their insurance products.\n\nAs disaster insurance takes on large regional risks rather \n\nthan smaller individual ones, risk can be spread, or reinsured, \nacross wide geographical areas with varying disaster risk \npro\ufb01les. One suggested solution is to combine indemnity and \nindexed insurance. Community mutual insurance groups \ncould provide indemnity insurance against individual shocks, \nthe system backed by indexed insurance for the community, \noffering protection against aggregate shocks by transferring the \nrisk to reinsurers (Clarke and Grenham 2013). \n\n\f1\u2002 Number of active risk transfer schemes in 2012 and 2018, \n\nby subregion\n\n2012\n2018\n\nSouth Asia Southeast Asia\n\nEast Asia\n\nThe Paci\ufb01c Central Asia\n\nNote: The Paci\ufb01c Catastrophic Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative in the \nCook Islands, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu is the scheme \nfor the Paci\ufb01c.

Each entry in this database was referred to as a \n\u201cscheme,\u201d and each scheme was defined by two key \nproperties: the transfer of risk away from entities in \nlow- or middle-income countries, and the use of one or \nmore ex-ante market-based risk transfer instruments. \nCommercial insurance was sold and purchased, \nbut most schemes in the database included some \ngovernment involvement. \n\nThere were 35 schemes actively transferring risk in \n\n2012, since expanded to 53 schemes operating today. \nIncreases have been notable in Southeast Asia and \nthe Pacific in this period, rising from 8 schemes in \n2012 to 22 in 2018 (box figure 1). Many countries in \ndeveloping Asia now boast multiple disaster insurance \nschemes, including 15 in India, 8 in the PRC, 8 in the \nPhilippines, 6 in Bangladesh, and 5 in Indonesia. \n\n30\n\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\nFrom the demand side, reaching poorer household with \ngreater\u00a0insurance penetration is a notable challenge because of \nsome tough constraints: such households\u2019 limited perception of \nrisk and willingness to disregard it, particularly risk for events \nwith low probability; the budget constraints that deter poorer \nhouseholds from purchasing insurance; and the tendency among \nthe poor to view insurance as an investment rather than a hedge \nagainst risk, encouraging underinsurance. Relatively\u00a0low take-up \nfor novel indexed insurance by smallholder farmers in particular \nhas been highlighted, for\u00a0example in Carter et al. (2017) and \nSurminski, Panda, and Lambert (forthcoming). \n\nIn theory, demand for formal insurance may be crowded out \nby the informal community risk-sharing mechanisms prevalent \nin many developing countries, for example among groups of \nsmallholder farmers. However, it has been shown that informal \nrisk-sharing can complement formal indexed insurance, with the \ninformal network protecting households from basis risk\u2014which is, \nas noted above, the mismatch between actual losses and payouts \nfrom indexed policies (Mobarak and Rosensweig 2013). \n\nSuccessful disaster insurance programs implemented to date \n\nhave tended to rely on some form of public subsidy (Box\u00a02.3.5). \nDevelopment partners have participated in a number of \ufb01nancing \nsolutions for disaster risk, seeking to provide associated \npublic goods such as data collection and helping to cover \ufb01xed \nestablishment costs. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)105\n\n2.3.5\u2002Continued\n\nOf the active schemes, 70% offer microinsurance \n\n(box figure 2), and 12% are larger sovereign risk \narrangements. The coverage of the schemes ranges \nfrom a single country, such as earthquake insurance \nbonds issued by the Government of the PRC, to \nregional schemes such as the Pacific Catastrophe Risk \nAssessment and Financing Initiative, which pools \nsovereign disaster risks in five Pacific island countries.\nMost of the schemes included in the database are \ndelivered by private entities, with international public \nentities providing 11%, national public entities 30%, \nand NGOs 5%. Over 80% of the schemes include \nsubsidies or other financial support, and 13% are fully \nsubsidized and free for those covered. \n\nMost active schemes, or 62%, cover agricultural \nlosses. Among these, 74% are indexed, with the risk \ntransfer determined by weather indexes or other \nindexes such as average crop yield. \n\nA third of the insurance schemes are bundled \nwith credit and compulsory, with loans disbursed \nonly in combination with insurance. The major \nbenefit of credit-linked insurance is the reduced \npossibility of debtor default as debtors are insuring \nagainst\u00a0catastrophic shocks. In the Philippines, the \nthree most prominent microinsurance schemes are all \ncredit-linked. \n\n2\u2002 Number of disaster insurance schemes,  \n\n3\u2002 Schemes with government financial support,  \n\nby subregion and type\n\nby scheme type\n\nPartly subsidized\nFully subsidized\nNone\n\n%\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\nMicro\nMeso\nSME\nSovereign\n\n1\n\n%\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n22\n\n3\n\n1\n\n3\n\n13\n\n13\n\n5\n\n24\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nCentral Asia\n\nEast Asia\n\nThe Paci\ufb01c\n\nSouth Asia Southeast Asia\n\nMicro\n\nSME\n\nMeso\n\nSovereign\n\nSME = small and medium-sized enterprise.\nNotes: Micro schemes facilitate access to disaster insurance for individuals, often to protect the livelihoods of the poor against extreme events. SME schemes \nare for homeowners, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and public entities. Meso schemes provide cover for risk aggregators such as banks, micro\ufb01nance \ninstitutions, agribusinesses, and municipal actors such as water authorities. Sovereign schemes aim to increase the \ufb01nancial response of governments in the \naftermath of disasters while protecting their long-term \ufb01scal balances through risk transfer instruments including insurance. Six\u00a0schemes span two insurance types, \nsuch as microinsurance and meso insurance for farmers and micro\ufb01nance institutes, and are thus double counted. \nSource: Surminski, Panda, and Lambert, forthcoming.\n\nDevelopment partners have provided technical inputs and \n\n\ufb01nancing for designing products, developing the underlying \ndisaster risk models, capitalizing insurance pools, and, in some \ncases, granting subsidies for premiums. The challenge for \ngovernment is to create new insurance markets, rather than \nsimply\u00a0replace insurance previously sold by private providers.\nFinally, disaster insurance can be designed to encourage \nrisk\u00a0reduction in addition to its primary goal of transferring\u00a0risk. \n\n\f106(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nProviding incentives for risk reduction is possible when insurance \npremiums can be linked accurately to risk, so that premium \ndiscounts motivate risk reduction. Measuring the effects of \ninsurance on resilience and risk outcomes remains difficult \n(Surminski, Panda, and Lambert, forthcoming). Some examples \nindicated resilience bene\ufb01ts, however, such\u00a0as indexed livestock \ninsurance in Mongolia, which subsidized insurance for herders \nand was found to have improved survival\u00a0rates for the livestock of \npolicy-holding herders (Bertram-Huemmer and Kati 2015).\n\nStrengthening disaster resilience is increasingly important \nas exposure to natural hazard risk rises, and as climate change \ncontinues to alter risk pro\ufb01les. Risk reduction is necessary to keep \nsome insurance programs viable in the future (Surminski, Panda, \nand Lambert, forthcoming). Without risk reduction, unviable \ninsurance programs may impose, when they fail, explicit or implicit \nliabilities on governments. Today, more and more providers of \ndisaster insurance recognize this and include risk reduction targets \nand objectives. Surminski, Panda, and Lambert (forthcoming) \nfound that explicit support for risk reduction has become more \nwidespread, offered by only one-third of providers in 2012 but by \ntwo-thirds in 2018. \n\nA comprehensive approach to disaster risk \nDisaster insurance generally requires public backing to provide both \n\ufb01nancial support and risk modeling. The longer-term sustainability \nof programs and their success in reaching the poorest and most \nvulnerable requires coordination with broader risk management and \ndevelopment policies to limit any worsening of exposure to disaster \nrisk and to improve access to credit and \ufb01nancial services. \n\nAn integrated approach includes investing directly in disaster \nresilience within communities, because local residents are the \ufb01rst \nresponders in disasters, often with little or no external support, and \nare key to ensuring sustained recovery and reconstruction. Thus, \nstrengthening communities\u2019 resilience goes some way toward the \nultimate goal of strengthening societal resilience.\n\nQuanti\ufb01able measures of social and community resilience \nare critical for multiple reasons: They allow community progress \nto be tracked over time in a standardized way. They enable \nthe prioritization of measures most needed by the community. \nAnd\u00a0they generate evidence for identifying what characteristics \ncontribute most to community disaster resilience before an event \nstrikes, and what can be done after it\u00a0strikes.\n\nNew evidence from \ufb02ood resilience surveys shows that \ncommunity investments can build resilience while delivering \nbroader development bene\ufb01ts, such as better education, \ntransportation, and food supply (Box 2.3.6). Proper waste \nmanagement, for example, keeps rivers and drains unclogged \nand\u00a0reduces the spread of disease after a \ufb02ood, while bene\ufb01ting \na community more broadly by improving public health and well-\nbeing in normal times.\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)107\n\n2.3.6\u2002Measuring community resilience\u2014what gets measured gets managed\n\nNew evidence from Flood Resilience Measurement for \nCommunities, a conceptual framework and assessment \ntool developed by the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance, \nis beginning to shed light on the factors that contribute \nto disaster resilience in communities while facilitating \nthe design of innovative DRM strategies. \n\nIn developing Asia, this tool has been applied \nin Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, and \nTimor-Leste by five NGOs in seven country programs. \nCommunities were selected based on their flood risk \nand such socioeconomic indicators as poverty and \nvulnerability, prioritizing poor or otherwise vulnerable \ncommunities perceived to be at high risk of flooding. \nBaseline studies were conducted in 88 communities \nin 2016\u20132017, directly involving more than 4,000 \nhouseholds and indirectly 220,000.\n\nThe data show socioeconomic factors such as \neducational attainment and the type and diversity \nof livelihood strategies closely correlated with flood \nresilience. Approximately 20% of sources of flood \nresilience studied in the framework overlap with \nsources of community development, the other 80% \nbeing more flood-specific. This overlap between \ncommunity flood resilience and general community \ndevelopment indicators\u2014such as education, \ntransportation, and food supply systems\u2014suggests \nsignificant potential for investment with significant \ncollateral benefits.\n\nThe survey further found that rural households \nface greater resilience challenges, with 90% of those \nsurveyed having suffered loss of life or significant \ndamage to assets from flooding in the past decade. \nRural households took longer to recover financially \nfrom floods than their urban counterparts. \nThe\u00a0assessment of resilience indicators, aggregated \nby community type, suggests greater room for \nimprovement in rural areas (box figure 1). Coping \nstrategies appear to be significantly stronger in \nurban communities, in part because urban residents \nin the sample are on average wealthier and are less \ndependent on the local environment, both natural \nand social, for their livelihoods as a result of higher \nlivelihood diversification.\n\nAcross all communities, the factor contributing \nto flood resilience with the highest grade is often \nhuman capital, while financial capital is graded very \nlow. Education, transportation, and water supply are \ntypically among the greatest strengths identified. \nThis may be because NGOs see these services as \neasy wins and useful entry points for building \ncommunity flood resilience. It may also be because \nthese services are traditional targets for community \ndevelopment\u00a0investment. \n\n1\u2002Distribution of flood resilience scores, by settlement type\n\nSigni\ufb01cantly below good standard, potential for imminent loss\nDe\ufb01ciencies, evident room for improvement\nGood resilience standard, no immediate need for improvement\nBest practice in community resilience\n\nRural\n\nPeri-urban\n\nUrban\n\nTotal\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nSource: Laurien and Keating, forthcoming. \n\n%\n\nAnother common strength, identified across \nthe communities in the sample, is knowledge and \nawareness of flood-exposed areas. In fact, this is one of \nthe highest-graded sources of resilience: tenth in urban \ncommunities, first in peri-urban, and second in rural \ncommunities. It is encouraging to note that efforts by \nlocal authorities, community organizations, and NGOs \nto increase knowledge and awareness of flood risk are \nfound to have enjoyed some success.\n\nA number of significant gaps in flood resilience are \nalso identified, with differences seen across community \ntypes. These differences were highlighted in two \ncase studies, one on urban communities in Semarang, \nIndonesia, and the other on rural communities in \nthe Yawan District in Afghanistan (box\u00a0figure 2). \nBoth\u00a0communities showed improvement across \nall resilience categories over time. Comparing \ncommunities, capacity improvement was assessed \nas stronger across all five types of capital in urban \ncommunities in Indonesia than in rural communities \nin Afghanistan. Financial capital appeared to be the \nworst weakness in rural Afghan communities, while \nweak social and natural capital were larger areas of \nconcern in urban Indonesian communities.\n\nThese types of findings can inform decisions \nfor DRM, resilience, and well-being by helping to \nprioritize intervention investments into community or \nregional programs that, for example, leverage human \ncapital or prioritize financial coping strategies. \n\ncontinued next page\n\n\fSimilarly, in Yawan District in Afghanistan, surveys \n\nhighlighted vulnerability to transitory disaster-\ninduced food and water insecurity when fuel became \nunavailable for cooking and boiling water. In response, \nsolar cookers were distributed to the poorest and most \nvulnerable households in the communities studied. \nWhile supporting food and water security, the cookers \noffered additional benefits by promoting gender \nequality and environmental sustainability.\n\n108(cid:17)(cid:17)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n2.3.6\u2002Continued\n\nThe utility of this kind of study is illustrated by \nthe innovative disaster resilience initiatives it has \nfacilitated and by the old adage \u201cwhat gets measured \ngets managed.\u201d For example, the performance of \nwaste management systems in the event of a disaster, \nhighlighted in Semarang City, and the need to engage \nin prospective risk reduction were not previously \nwell understood as important by NGOs working in \ncommunity development and disaster resilience, but \nbecame better understood through the use of the tool \nFlood Resilience Measurement for Communities.\n\n2\u2002Distribution of grades of resilience\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nRural Afghanistan\n\nUrban Indonesia\n\nBL\nEL\nFinancial\n\nBL\nEL\nHuman\n\nBL\nEL\nNatural\n\nBL\nEL\nPhysical\n\nBL\n\nEL\nSocial\n\nBL\nEL\nFinancial\n\nBL\n\nEL\nHuman\n\nBL\nEL\nNatural\n\nBL\nEL\nPhysical\n\nBL\n\nEL\n\nSocial\n\nA = best practice in community resilience, B = good resilience standard, no immediate need for improvement, BL = baseline, C = de\ufb01ciencies, evident room for \nimprovement, D = signi\ufb01cantly below good standard, potential for imminent loss, EL = end line.\nSource: Laurien and Keating, forthcoming. \n\nThe value of local indigenous knowledge\nRecent experience after major earthquakes and tropical cyclones \nin Asia further demonstrates the role of local communities \nand indigenous groups as custodians of local knowledge and \nexperience relevant to effective DRM. In\u00a0particular, indigenous \ngroups, with their long history in their home locations, possess \nbetter information about severe but very low-frequency events, \ncatastrophes that are all but invisible to modern modeling \ntechniques and observations using short time periods. The most \nstriking recent example of this is from the Indian Ocean tsunami \nof\u00a02004 and is described in McAdoo\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0(2006).\n\nExamples abound of the ways in which indigenous knowledge \n\nand practice was, is, or can be used proactively in DRM. \nFor\u00a0example, Kelman, Mercer, and Gaillard (2012) identi\ufb01ed in \ncommunities in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea several \nways in which indigenous knowledge pointed to vulnerabilities that \nwere not recognized through more modern scienti\ufb01c knowledge. \nAnother\u00a0example is traditional building techniques, such as those \nused to build hazard-resilient vernacular housing in Nepal.\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:17)(cid:17)109\n\nknowledge: \n(i)\n\nThree observations pertain to indigenous or traditional \n\nContext is important, and this knowledge is only \nsometimes transferable. \n\n(ii) Building on knowledge already accepted within an \n\nindigenous community helps to align actions with the \nthings that the community values and understands, \nempowering them to recognize what they can do \nfor\u00a0themselves. \n\n(iii) Even indigenous communities are rarely homogeneous, \nand neither is their body of knowledge. As such, \nno nugget of knowledge necessarily applies to all \nmembers of a community. In any case, even indigenous \ncommunities with traditional knowledge may have \nonly\u00a0limited experience of recovering from catastrophic \nevents over the long term.\n\nThese challenges notwithstanding, harnessing indigenous \n\nknowledge can help to mainstream disaster risk reduction \npolicies and practice, as well as contribute to their integration \nwith all disaster-related policies and processes, from prevention \nto recovery.\n\n\f110(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nPrepared to build back\u00a0better \nafter a disaster\n\nAlmost all measurement and discussion of disaster risk focuses \non the immediate impact of disasters and the emergency phase. \nResearchers and practitioners alike pay little attention to the \nlonger-term consequences of these events: how they affect \nlong-term economic trajectories; the longer-term political, \ncultural, and social perspectives; and their impacts on public \nhealth and the environment. In line with the dearth of research \non long-term outcomes, policy frameworks and implementation \nplans almost always emphasize only the short-term and expend \nless effort planning for the long-term.\n\nIn contrast with these gaps in detailed policy research and \nimplementation discussions, the literature is full of aspirational \nplans to \u201cbuild back better\u201d and to facilitate recovery from \ndisaster that is more than complete, adding improvements that \ngo beyond the situation before the disaster. The United\u00a0Nations \nGeneral Assembly adopted in 2016 a definition of build back \nbetter (BBB) that was developed by an intergovernmental \nexpert working group convened by the United Nations Office \nfor Disaster Risk Reduction (Box 2.4.1). In this definition, BBB \naims to strengthen resilience in nations and communities and to \nrevitalize livelihoods, economies, and the environment (UN\u00a02016). \nAs Oscar Wilde observed: \u201cA map of the world that does not \ninclude Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the \none country at which Humanity is always landing. And when \nHumanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, \nsets sail. Progress is the realization of Utopias\u201d (Wilde\u00a02009). \n\n2.4.1\u2002What is \u2018build back better\u2019?\n\nThe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \nwas signed in 2015 and endorsed by all ADB members \nin the Ulaanbaatar Declaration of 2018. Priority 4b.4 \nin the Sendai Framework calls on its signatories to \n\u201cinstitute or strengthen policies, laws, and programs \nthat promote (incentivize), guide (ensure), and support \nBuild Back Better (BBB) in Recovery, Rehabilitation, \nand Reconstruction.\u201d \n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Expert \n\nWorking Group on Indicators and Terminology \nwas tasked with clarifying the central concepts \nthat guide the Sendai Framework priorities. \n\nThe\u00a0working\u00a0group\u00a0defined build back better \nas \u201cthe\u00a0use of the recovery, rehabilitation, and \nreconstruction phases after a disaster to increase \nthe resilience of nations and communities through \nintegrating disaster risk reduction measures into the \nrestoration of physical infrastructure and societal \nsystems, and into the revitalization of livelihoods, \neconomies, and the environment.\u201d \n\nIn this definition, agreed after wide consultation, \nthere are four goals for building back better: increased \nresilience, revitalization of livelihoods, revitalization of \neconomies, and revitalization of the environment. \n\ncontinued next page\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)111\n\n2.4.1\u2002Continued\n\nResilience\u2014maybe the thorniest term of all\u2014is \ndefined by the same working group as \u201cthe ability \nof a system, community, or society exposed to \nhazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, \ntransform, and recover from the effects of a hazard \nin a timely and efficient manner, including through \nthe preservation and restoration of its essential basic \nstructures and functions through risk management.\u201d \nAs such, resilience focuses on what happens over time \nto a system, community, or society after it has been \nexposed to a hazard.\n\nThe build-back-better paradigm first achieved some \n\nprominence after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami \nand was frequently mentioned in recovery planning \nafter that catastrophe. The former US president Bill \nClinton was the UN secretary general\u2019s special envoy \nfor tsunami recovery, a position he later held in Haiti \nduring and after the earthquake there in 2010. The \nspecial envoy outlined 10 Key Propositions for Building \nBack Better (Clinton 2006). Based on the definition \nfrom the UN working group and the special envoy\u2019s \npropositions, the concept of build back better can \nbe operationalized through four easily identifiable \nand distinct aims: safety, speed, inclusiveness, and \nopportunity (box figure).\n\nThe build-back-better paradigm\n\nBUILD BACK BETTER\n\nSafety\n\nSpeed\n\nInclusiveness\n\nOpportunity\n\nUN working\ngroup\n\nGoal A\n\nGoal B\n\nGoal C\n\nGoal B\n\nGoal B\n\nGoal C\n\nIncreased resilience\n\nRevitalization\nof livelihoods\n\nRevitalization\nof economies\n\nRevitalization of livelihoods\n\nRevitalization\nof livelihoods\n\nRevitalization\nof economies\n\nPROPOSITION 3\nGovernments must enhance\npreparedness for future\ndisasters.\n\nPROPOSITION 5\nGood recovery planning \nand effective coordination\ndepend on good information.\n\nSpecial envoy\npropositions\n\nPROPOSITION 10\nGood recovery must leave\ncommunities safer by \nreducing risks and building \nresilience.\n\nPROPOSITION 6\nThe UN, the World Bank, and \nother multilateral agencies \nmust clarify their roles and \nrelationships, especially in\naddressing the early stage of a\nrecovery process.\n\nPROPOSITION 7\nThe expanding role of \nNGOs and the Red Cross/\nRed Crescent Movement\ncarries greater responsibilities\nfor quality in recovery efforts.\n\nNGO = nongovernment organization, UN = United Nations.\nSource: Authors.\n\nPROPOSITION 8\nFrom the start of recovery\noperations, governments and\naid agencies must create the\nconditions for entrepreneurs\nto \ufb02ourish.\n\nPROPOSITION 1\nGovernments, donors, and\naid agencies must recognize\nthat families and communities\ndrive their own recovery.\n\nPROPOSITION 2\nRecovery must promote\nfairness and equity.\n\nPROPOSITION 4\nLocal governments must be\nempowered to manage\nrecovery efforts, and donors\nmust devote greater resources\nto strengthening government\nrecovery institutions, \nespecially at locally.\n\nPROPOSITION 7\nThe expanding role of \nNGOs and the\nRed Cross/Red Crescent\nMovement carries greater\nresponsibilities for quality in\nrecovery efforts.\n\nPROPOSITION 9\nBene\ufb01ciaries deserve the \nkind of agency partnerships\nthat move beyond rivalry and\nunhealthy competition.\n\n\f112(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nWhile\u00a0the previous section focused on what is being done, and \nwhat more can be done, to reduce the cost of disasters and \ntheir immediate aftermath, here the focus is on the aspirations \nbehind BBB. These aspirations may sound utopian, but they are \nnonetheless achievable, even if only rarely so far. To turn\u00a0utopia \ninto policy, operationalize BBB. \n\nGovernance challenges\nBeyond a better definition of BBB, and before any attempt to define \nthe path leading to BBB, it is necessary to address the governance \nchallenges that are typically posed in the aftermath of a disaster. \n\nThe recovery phase can be a very fluid time with opportunities \n\npoised against the many barriers and obstacles that seem \nto dominate the landscape. A demand surge for specialized \nconstruction services after an earthquake, for example, can \nnurture the emergence of a thriving seismic engineering \nknowledge industry that can become a future service export when \nthis knowledge is required elsewhere. However, many of these \npotential benefits require active policy decisions and mechanisms \nthat facilitate useful developments. Without them, such nascent \nopportunities will be missed. More\u00a0fundamentally, overcoming \nthe many barriers and obstacles that are always present in \npost-disaster recovery equally demands active management of \nthese\u00a0challenges.\n\nOften, post-disaster financing is at the forefront of planning \nfor reconstruction and recovery. However, such a focus does not \nadequately address the implementation challenges associated with \npost-disaster operations. Past experience amply demonstrates that \na lack of access to finance is not the only barrier to a swift return \nto normality (Hallegatte, Rentschler, and Walsh 2018, Mochizuki, \nHallwright, and Handmer, forthcoming). Even with financing \navailable, governments, firms, and households often struggle to \nreconstruct and recover. \n\nThe efficient and productive use of disaster risk finance, \n\nwhen it is available, is frequently stymied by the complex \ngovernance landscape of post-disaster operations and its multiple \nactors. Even when agreements clearly define responsibilities, \nlocal administrative capacity may be overwhelmed by the due \ndiligence and reporting requirements of a highly fragmented \nresponse\u00a0community. \n\nOvercoming these obstacles requires comprehensive disaster \n\nrisk financing strategies. They should go beyond developing \ndisaster risk financing instruments by also enhancing budget \nexecution capacity so that financing can be used promptly and \neffectively. Adequate procedures for appropriating, disbursing, \nand monitoring the use of post-disaster funding, and capacity to \nimplement them, are essential for successful mobilization and \nrecovery. Adequate emergency procurement regulations and \ncapacity, including advance contracting arrangements, are also key. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)113\n\nIn other cases, partly because of failure to consult \nwith local entities, stakeholders, and the people directly \naffected, governments may underestimate the obstacles and \nopportunities in the post-disaster environment. Population \nmovements, skills bottlenecks, and inflation in a construction \nboom can all delay procurement and rebuilding. \n\nIn general, it helps tremendously to have the roles and \nresponsibilities of external and internal actors clearly codified \nin formal frameworks and policy guidelines. That said, without \nexperiential knowledge gained from past recovery processes, \nand without mutual trust, any predetermined plan for \nreconstruction and recovery is prone to implementation failure \nin the chaos of post-disaster operations. If no such plan exists, \nand the actors lack experience, the governance challenges \nposed by this process are immense.\n\nOne crucial need for building experiential knowledge is \n\nto institutionalize lessons from previous events. Disasters \nare opportunities to develop this knowledge toward better \nmanaging the next disaster. Quantitative evidence shows that \ncountries that have experienced frequent smaller disasters are \nbetter able to handle large ones. \n\nPreparing for recovery funding \nOvercoming all these governance challenges requires enablers \nthat are both explicit and tacit. Explicit enablers facilitate \nsetting up appropriate institutions, getting access to recovery \nfinancing, and establishing with clarity participants\u2019 roles and \nresponsibilities by drafting pre-disaster plans and frameworks. \nTacit enablers provide opportunities for building trust, gaining \nexperiential knowledge through joint simulation exercises, \nand fostering the operational knowledge and capacity local \nstaff need to handle the complex administrative demands of \nthe post-disaster period. Explicit and tacit enablers are equally \nimportant to the success of BBB.\n\nGoverning post-disaster operations is a complex \n\nundertaking in under-resourced environments. This is partly \nbecause the availability of sufficient external assistance is \nunpredictable, but also because multiple external and domestic \nactors must be mobilized and coordinated despite varying and \npotentially conflicting recovery priorities and disagreements \nover them. \n\nWhile immediate humanitarian needs are fulfilled through \n\na large variety of funding sources, formal channels for the \nfunds necessary for long-term recovery and reconstruction \nare typically the product of a post-disaster needs assessment \nand conferences called in response to requests for external \nassistance and support from the national government. \n\n\f114(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nImmediate humanitarian relief is typically coordinated \n\nnationally and supported internationally through an \nestablished protocol using a cluster approach, as was \ndone in Nepal through the National Disaster Response \nFramework (Box 2.4.2). In\u00a0contrast, long-term recovery and \nreconstruction is primarily led by national, subnational, and \nlocal governments. These bodies typically operate in a less \ncoordinated fashion, reflecting their limited capacity and \nexperience in designing and implementing complex rebuilding \nprojects (Lloyd-Jones 2006). Clarifying the respective roles \nof the various government entities, with clear demarcation \nof responsibilities and decision-making roles, is key to their \nsuccessful collaboration.\n\n2.4.2\u2002The 2015 earthquake in Nepal\u2014challenges to rebuilding homes and livelihoods\n\nThe 2015 earthquake in Nepal, striking on 25 April \nwith an initial shock of magnitude 7.8, caused \nover 8,790 deaths and 22,300 injuries. It displaced \n2.8\u00a0million, and the 8 million people who were affected \nin one way or another amounted to a third of the \ncountry\u2019s population (Government of Nepal 2015). \nFourteen of Nepal\u2019s 75 districts were classified as \n\u201ccrisis hit\u201d and received targeted support for rescue \nand relief (IMF 2015). \n\nStrong international support\nOn 29 April, a UN flash appeal launched by 78 \nparticipating organizations made an initial request \nfor $422 million to use in the following 3 months. \nA\u00a0post-disaster needs assessment released 2 months \nafter the initial earthquake estimated that damages \nand other losses could add up to some $7 billion, equal \nto a third of Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product. Half of \nthe damage was to private homes (Government of \nNepal 2015). In the months following the earthquake, \nthe value of remittances increased by 20%\u201335% \n(UNOCHA 2015). The International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) forecast that higher remittances would be \noffset by lost income from tourism and higher imports \nneeded to supply recovery efforts and reconstruction. \nThe IMF subsequently approved the disbursement \nof $49.7 million in direct budgetary support under its \nRapid Credit Facility (IMF 2015). Within 2 months \nof the initial shock, ADB approved $200 million in \nemergency assistance to rebuild and restore schools, \nroads, and public buildings.\n\nIn June, the Government of Nepal hosted an \ninternational conference on Nepal\u2019s reconstruction. \nThe international community pledged $4.4 billion in \ngrants and loans to support the country\u2019s recovery \nand reconstruction (IMF 2015). This was more than \ntwice the amount requested in the government\u2019s initial \n\ncall for support, but actual disbursement would prove \nto be much lower and delayed. To facilitate home \nreconstruction in the hardest hit 14 rural districts, the \nNepal Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Program \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund was established with support \nfrom the international community. \n\nIn May 2016, the government published a 5-year \n\npost-disaster recovery framework outlining five \nstrategic focuses: restore and improve disaster-\nresilient buildings, strengthen the disaster resilience \nof communities and individuals and foster social \ncohesion, restore and improve access to services, \nrestore and develop livelihoods, and build the state\u2019s \ncapacity to respond to future disasters (NRA 2016). \n\nNeed for better coordination \nThe National Disaster Response Framework, created \nin 2013, was tasked with aligning the international \nhumanitarian cluster coordination structure with \nnational line ministries, designating each national \nministry as cluster lead and an international \nhumanitarian agency as the co-lead of a streamlined \nstructure with 11 clusters. The framework further \nprovided a detailed timeline and assignment of \nresponsibilities for 62 actions to be taken immediately \nfollowing a disaster. Surveys conducted after the \nearthquake revealed that 30 of 62 mandatory \nemergency operations were performed in accordance \nwith the framework (Bisri and Beniya 2016). \n\nWhile these pre-disaster activities have certainly \n\nhelped coordinate immediate response, a number \nof concerns were raised, one pertaining to a rapid \nsurge of new actors in the cluster system. The shelter \ncluster, for example, had 10 agencies that regularly \nparticipated in it before the earthquake, but the cluster \nnow had 120 agencies that needed to be coordinated \n(IASC 2016). Another concern was the very limited \n\ncontinued next page\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)115\n\n2.4.2\u2002Continued\n\ninclusion of national NGOs and local actors in the \nofficial coordination mechanisms. Of $422 million \nin the consolidated humanitarian appeal made by 78 \norganizations, only 0.8% of the funds were directed to \nNepali organizations. Further, the National Disaster \nResponse Framework did not address coordinating \nwith the needs of national NGOs and local actors, \nleaving smaller organizations to continue to work \noutside of the formal cluster system. \n\nOn the ground, relief efforts were hampered by \nother factors such as a dearth of local knowledge; a \nlack of local leadership to convey needs from locals and \nsupport from international participants; administrative \ninefficiency; sporadic implementation of national \npolicies that were considered irrelevant in particular \nlocal contexts; border tensions, which increased \nprices for fuel and other goods; and discrimination by \nsocial caste. In many instances, isolated by complex \ntopography and bedeviled by implementation \nchallenges, participants had to learn to help themselves \n(Auerbach 2015, Cook, Shrestha, and Bo 2016, Dahal \n2016, Grunewald and Burlat 2016, Hall et al. 2017). \n\nFunding challenges\nDespite generous pledges from the international \ncommunity, Nepal\u2019s reconstruction faced numerous \nfunding challenges. As of April 2018, almost 3 years \nafter the earthquake, only 16% of reconstruction \npledges had actually been disbursed. Against the \nofficial goal of rebuilding 400,000 homes by the end \nof fiscal 2018 in mid-June of last year, only a quarter \nhad been completed. As is quite typical in post-disaster \nrecovery in many countries, including wealthy ones, \nthe 3-year mark was when frustration with delays \nstarted to boil over and trust in the authorities started \nto erode.\n\nEven when funding was secured nationally, \nreconstruction projects faced local implementation \nchallenges: a lack of skilled personnel, skills mismatch \nin labor markets, disputes over eligibility for \nreconstruction grants, price increases for construction \nmaterials and transportation, unclear land tenure, \ndelays in channeling funds through providers of \nfinancial services, and even the absence of bank \naccounts to facilitate transactions. \n\nTwo years after the earthquake, more than 60% \nof people in severely affected districts still lived in \ntemporary shelters. These challenges persisted despite \nprogress in streamlining reconstruction and the \npublication of guidelines for settlement development, \nsubsidy distribution, and training and deploying \npersonnel, as well as the provision of a design \ncatalogue for earthquake-resistant building prototypes.\n\nThe Nepal case study illustrates the common \n\ngovernance challenges of financing and implementing \npost-disaster operations. According to official statistics \npublished on 2 May 2018, Nepal had achieved mixed \nprogress on reconstruction and recovery: Of\u00a0379\u00a0public \nbuildings to be rebuilt, 220 had been rebuilt and \nanother 147 were under construction. Of\u00a07,553 \neducational facilities to be rebuilt, 3,613 had been \ncompleted and another 1,719 were under construction, \nwhile the rest were still in planning stages. \n\nMeanwhile, of 753 cultural heritage structures \nto be rebuilt, 100 had been completed and another \n329 were under construction. Similarly, many health \ninstitutions and drinking water systems still had to \nbe rebuilt, with 581 completed and 795 still under \nconstruction (NRA\u00a02018). This illustrates how the \nvictims\u2019 full recovery of livelihoods remains elusive for \nmany, especially those living in remote areas or still in \ntemporary shelters. \n\nIn addition to the different levels of government, community \n\nmembers providing mutual support, and families receiving \nremittances, voluntary organizations funded by contributions \nfrom private individuals and philanthropic organizations occupy \ntheir corner of the reconstruction and recovery ecosystem, as do \ninternational NGOs. Coordinating these diverse entities presents \nconsiderable challenges to governments and their partners. \nAn\u00a0important role for the entity in charge of reconstruction, \ntypically an office of the national government, is therefore to \nwork\u00a0together with funders, local government, the private\u00a0sector, \nand civil society. Part of the job is naturally to define the aims \nof post-disaster recovery and coordinate the assemblage and \ndistribution of resources during the design and implementation \nphases of the recovery process.\n\n\f116(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nPlanning and training as \nkey elements of recovery\nContingency planning for recovery, backed by pre-financing \narrangements, can be a useful vehicle to clarify expectations \nbefore a disaster hits, and to facilitate setting recovery on a \nBBB track after it does. Defining governance arrangements \nand codifying them through legislative action before a disaster \nstrikes is particularly important. While the details will always \nbe specific to particular disasters, the main framework for \ngoverning the recovery process should be decided ahead of\u00a0time.\nAfter a disaster, the assessment of needs has conventionally \n\nbeen implemented as a technical exercise using information \non economic damage and the country\u2019s access to domestic and \nexternal resources. Yet more can be achieved toward facilitating \nthe implementation of post-disaster BBB if, in the needs-\nassessment phase, a plan for BBB is already incorporated into the \ndecision-making process. \n\nGovernments and domestic stakeholders should ensure \nthat roles and responsibilities are clearly defined in all phases \nof post-disaster operations. In particular, though, they should \nplan in advance for the recovery and reconstruction phases \nof the disaster cycle. Emphasis should be placed on setting \nclear mandates within the ministries of national governments \nregarding the coordination of financing, operations, and \nmonitoring of disaster response, recovery, and reconstruction. \nPre-disaster training and simulations should clarify roles and \nresponsibilities across government departments, as well as units\u2019 \nrelationships with international and domestic partners in the \nprivate sector and civil society. \n\nOften missing in contingency planning are procedures \nfor a transition from emergency response to recovery and \nreconstruction over the medium and long term. Setting up \nexplicit rules and systems is only part of what is required, but a \npart that often plagues post-disaster reconstruction. Local staff \nand partners should have sufficient training and knowledge \nbefore the disaster to effectively follow plans and procedures \nwhen pressed for time in the post-disaster phase. Capacity-\nbuilding programs should therefore target international, \nnational, and local actors alike, including the government, \nprivate firms, and civil society, and should elaborate the details \nof operational processes and any requirements related to \nexternal disaster risk financing and ways of preparing domestic \nfinancial, accounting, and accountability systems to scale up \ntheir operations as necessary after a disaster strikes.\n\nTo summarize, the United Nations International Strategy \n\nfor Disaster Reduction notes that national governments \nwould benefit greatly by creating a functional and productive \nenvironment where stakeholders appreciate the importance \nof a build-back-better mindset after disasters (UNISDR 2017). \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)117\n\nThis\u00a0should ideally be supported by national laws and equitably \nenforced, with all necessary resources\u2014human, financial, and \notherwise\u2013made readily available. Able leadership and good \ngovernance are essential to provide the support mechanisms \nneeded for such a strategy. \n\nExternal bene\ufb01ts of post-disaster \nreconstruction and recovery\nSupporting evidence for \u201ccreative destruction\u201d dynamics \nthat arise organically in post-disaster reconstruction appears \nto be limited to several cases, such as the 2008 Wenchuan \nearthquake in the PRC (Box 2.4.3). Nevertheless these few \ncases point to what a government can do to improve outcomes. \nOne is to offer generous funding to build resilience. After\u00a0the \n2008 earthquake, the Government of the PRC spent a very \nlarge amount of money to build more seismically robust \ninfrastructure. \n\nAnother way that recovery can engender favorable BBB \n\noutcomes, even if not deliberately, is for reconstruction to \ncreate positive externalities that enable development to speed \nup, bringing benefits that would have come only later, if at \nall, without reconstruction as a trigger. One vintage example \ncan be found in an analysis of the Great Boston Fire of 1872 \n(Hornbeck and Keniston 2017). The study found that the \nreconstruction of individual properties rendered benefits to \nnearby properties that facilitated their development as well. \nThe fire and the resulting need to reconstruct destroyed \nbuildings, it seems, accelerated urban renewal that otherwise \nwould have taken much longer.\n\nProgress through technological leap-frogging is another \n\npossibility, though infrequently realized. Hornbeck and \nNaidu (2014) found that the Great Mississippi Flood\u00a0of\u00a01927 \naccelerated the modernization of agriculture in the \narea through mechanization that was forced in part by \nlabor shortages occasioned by the outward migration of \nsharecroppers. According to the study, it was this shortage of \nlabor created by the flood that drove farmers to adopt new \ntechnologies. \n\nHowever, evidence exists that, even in a strong post-\ndisaster recovery enjoying generous financing from domestic \nand international sources, such as insurance and development \nassistance, the outcome can be a worsening of structural social \ninequality. This may happen because households with more \nincome are better able to withstand disasters and to benefit \nfrom long-term changes in the post-disaster environment \n(De\u00a0Alwis and Noy, forthcoming). This is clearly one aspect of \nthe BBB strategy that must be appropriately addressed.\n\n\f118(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n2.4.3\u2002The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake\n\nOn 12 May 2008, a massive earthquake measuring \n8.0 on the Richter scale struck Wenchuan County, \n92 kilometers northwest of Chengdu, the capital of \nSichuan Province in the PRC.

The \nstudy found that asset and income losses for surveyed \nhouseholds were substantial, especially in the most \nseverely damaged areas. It described \u201can overwhelming \ngovernment response to the disaster,\u201d with subsidies \nprovided to households in 2008 that were so large that \nmedian income per capita was 17.5% higher in 2008 \nthan in 2007 and the poverty rate declined from 34% \nto 19%. The extent of government support for victims \nof the Wenchuan earthquake was unprecedented.\n\nPerhaps reflecting this massive infusion of funding \nto the affected region, the trajectory of the provincial \npopulation seems to have shifted for the better after \nrecovery investment started to bear fruit (box figure\u00a02). \nThe earthquake in Wenchuan is a clear example of \na build-back-better recovery, premised on a massive \ninvestment in recovery through funding received from \nboth the Government of the PRC and the governments \nof several provinces.\n\n84\n\n83\n\n82\n\n81\n\n80\n\n79\n\nMigration after a disaster\nOutmigration is sometimes perceived as a failure of BBB, \nbut it can be a boon to those who choose to migrate and for \ntheir families. An example from Viet Nam is instructive. \nRural households in Viet\u00a0Nam cope with disasters mainly \nby sending family members into urban areas (Gr\u00f6ger and \nZylberberg 2016). As is common in lower-income countries, \nonly selected members of households are able migrate away \nfrom disaster-affected areas. Often, those displaced by a storm \nopt not to return. While the migrants\u2019 households benefit \nfrom remittances, the affected region ends up with a lower \npopulation and therefore less economic activity. \n\nConversely, disasters can motivate migration into the \n\naffected region. They may be attracted by spending on \nreconstruction, by the structural changes brought about by \nthe recovery spending, or even by risk reduction achieved \nafter the disaster. Such dynamics were evident in population \nincreases seen in areas in the Netherlands affected by the \nNorth Sea Flood in 1953, for instance, as these places benefited \nfrom a large public works program aiming to strengthen flood \nprotection in flood-prone areas (Husby et al. 2014). In-migration \ncan also reflect a surge in job opportunities, particularly in the \nbuilding industry, that may be only temporary. \n\n\f120(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nVoluntary migration into and out of affected areas can \ntherefore, under certain circumstances, enhance resilience and \nimprove well-being. Governments sometimes try to convince \ninhabitants of affected areas to relocate away from the most \nhazard-prone area by, for example, banning home construction \nwithin a certain distance of the shoreline. \n\nMuch better data is required on the length of post-disaster \nmigration in and out of affected areas to really grasp its drivers \nand implications. Only then will it be possible to develop \nappropriate policies and measures to manage migration well and \nencourage optimal flows of people.\n\nPolicy aims of building back better\n\u201cBuild back safer\u201d may be a better tagline than build back better \nbecause \u201cbetter\u201d can mean many things, some of which may \nactually worsen risk by, for example, increasing population \ndensity. \u201cSafer\u201d provides a clearer goal to focus on during \nrecovery, especially with respect to reconstructing residential \nand commercial buildings. The thinking behind this emphasis is \nthat safety should trump all other aspirations for post-disaster \nrecovery (Kennedy et al. 2008). \n\nIn many cases, however, there are other aims that \n\nresidents and policy makers hope to achieve with recovery and \nreconstruction. These aims can impose trade-offs that need to be \ncarefully balanced to avoid jeopardizing the goal of maintaining \nor strengthening safety. Important questions need to be asked \nwhen following BBB principles after a disaster (Kennedy et al. \n2008): Will recovery ensure safety and security? What will be \nthe impact on the affected community? Is it fair and equitable, \nand does it tackle the root causes of vulnerability?\n\nFollowing this logic, the World Bank has suggested three \nseparate components to building back better: stronger, faster, \nand more inclusive (Hallegatte, Rentschler, and Walsh 2018). \nIn line with this approach, it has been argued that building \nback stronger may have a different connotation than, say, \nbuilding back safer. This would be the case if, for example, \nsafety standards called for construction methods and standards \nthat could reasonably ensure that lives would not be lost as a \nconsequence of a disaster but not necessarily that the buildings \nwould be stronger and continue to be habitable after the disaster. \nHowever, even these goals can impose trade-offs that ought to \nbe carefully considered during reconstruction and recovery, \nespecially considering that, ultimately and most fundamentally, \nthe process should end with resilience enhanced enough for the \ncommunity to survive future disasters and more generally thrive \nin future circumstances. The\u00a0number of BBB components can \nthus be extended to four: safety, speed, fairness and inclusivity, \nand future social and economic potential. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)121\n\nBuilding back a safer environment\nReducing the risk of mortality and morbidity in future events is \nan uncontroversial goal of recovery and reconstruction in the \naftermath of any adverse event. One important observation is \nthat, unlike a lot of the other impacts of disasters, mortality and \nmorbidity are irreversible. As such, it is clear why preventing \nthem should be the overriding goal of reconstruction and \nrecovery policies. All things considered, preventing mortality and \nmorbidity is always likely to be the most important goal guiding \ngovernment policy after a disaster. It seems indisputable that \nsafety should be prioritized because the consequences of unsafe\u2014\nor less safe\u2014reconstruction would affect harmed individuals and \ntheir families for a very long\u00a0time. \n\nHallegatte, Rentschler, and Walsh (2018) used the term \n\n\u201cstronger\u201d instead of \u201csafer.\u201d This implied reconstructing houses, \npublic buildings, and transportation and other infrastructure \nin ways that make them more able to resist the onslaught of an \nextreme disaster. If the hazard is an earthquake, for example, this \nsuggests rebuilding with more robust construction methods so \nthat buildings will not collapse when shaken. Safety can also be \nachieved, however, through softer defenses\u2014the classic example \nof which is mangrove forests to counter risks from storm surges\u2014\nor by retreating from dangerous locations altogether (Hino et al. \n2017). Improved safety post-disaster can be achieved by other \npolicies as well, ones that do not entail strong, hard, or soft \nengineering solutions. \n\nEven further from bricks-and-mortar concerns but \nmaybe no less important is the strengthening of social ties \nwithin communities. This was found to be important in \npreventing mortality in the 2011 tsunami in Japan (Aldrich and \nSawada\u00a02015). Safety under tsunami risk depends on timely \nwarnings and the ability to evacuate. Social ties allow the timely \nevacuation of people, such as the elderly, who would find it \ndifficult to evacuate independently. Therefore, one can build back \na safer community by establishing mechanisms that strengthen \nsocial\u00a0ties. This\u00a0can\u00a0be achieved in many ways, for example \nthrough the spatial planning of residential neighborhoods. \n\nBuilding back faster for well-being\nRebuilding at a faster pace is also a fairly obvious and \nuncontroversial goal of public policy. All things being equal, \na faster recovery is always better than a slower one. Speed is \noften motivated as well by political and electoral pressures. \nSurprisingly, though, governments sometimes do not realize \nthat speeding up recovery is achievable and should be seen \nas an explicit policy goal. For example, many post-disaster \nsituations give rise to complicated legal questions that need to be \nresolved in court, such as on property rights, insurance liability, \nand the role of the various branches of government versus \n\n\f122(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nthe private\u00a0sector. Governments should make every effort to \nspeed this up and purposely remove any bottleneck that delays \nreconstruction and recovery. \n\nIn Sichuan, the government made a conscious and concerted \neffort to speed up recovery even as it benefited greatly from the \nabundant resources made available to finance reconstruction. \nIn\u00a0many cases, lack of funding is a stubborn bottleneck \nimpeding reconstruction. Indeed, recovery in Sichuan was much \nfaster than in other disaster-affected areas\u2014in Myanmar, for \nexample, in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Nargis in 2008, \nor even in high-income Japan during reconstruction following \nthe 2011\u00a0earthquake and tsunami. There are other barriers \nand hurdles to the process, however, so funding cannot be \nconsidered a guarantee of rapid reconstruction. \n\nThe more difficult problem is when the desire to speed\u00a0up \n\nrecovery conflicts with other explicit aims of the BBB \nframework. There may even be a trade-off between speed and \nsafety. If, for example, the disaster uncovered vulnerability \nor exposure that was not recognized before\u2014perhaps with \nthe discovery of a previously unknown seismic fault line\u2014\nit\u00a0may take some time to investigate and determine the best \ncorrective action, which may be an appropriate engineering \nsolution. In\u00a0such cases, building back safer may require a more \ndeliberative process.\n\nThe desire for speed clearly conflicts with the desire \nto consult with the affected local community and seek its \nparticipation, and it typically conflicts as well with the desire \nto carefully consider all plausible development, planning, and \nreconstruction paths. Many of these alternative paths entail \nsignificant planning effort and require reallocating property \nrights for certain assets, the most difficult of which is almost \nalways land. Alternative paths are challenging to implement \nin the best of times, and this is clearly one reason why speed \ndoes not seem to be a priority in many reconstruction projects. \nThe\u00a0existence of a trade-off between speed and a carefully \nconsidered reconstruction path is undeniable, but, all things \nbeing equal, speed should be prioritized. A slow recovery makes \nachieving a build-back-better recovery more difficult.\n\nBuilding back inclusively for a fairer community \nRecovery should aim to be fair and inclusive in both process \nand outcome. If recovery does not include consultations with \ncommunities and other stakeholders that were affected by the \nevent and will be affected by reconstruction, it is not inclusive \nin process. While there may be a lot of advantages to having \nrecovery guided by an authority tied to the central government \nand funded by it, the need to continuously consult with those \nthat are directly affected is not diminished and may even be \nstrengthened. \n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)123\n\nWithout adequate consultation, there will be no buy-in from \n\nthe local community and no assurance that the right decisions \nwill be made and supported. It is not unusual for recovery to \nbe derailed or delayed when disagreements or tensions arise \nbetween\u00a0affected communities and the authority guiding recovery. \nThe\u00a0aim\u00a0of bringing all community stakeholders into the decision-\nmaking process is to ensure both that the recovery trajectory \nis in the right direction and will achieve its stated build-back-\nbetter aims, and that community participation will smooth and \nspeed up the process by preventing misunderstandings and \nmiscommunication.\n\nIt is well known that affected communities are themselves \n\nthe first responders in disasters, often with little or no \nimmediate external support. Often overlooked is that local \ncommunities are also the key to ensuring sustained recovery and \nreconstruction. New evidence from flood resilience surveys across \n88\u00a0communities in Asia shows that community investments can \nbuild resilience while delivering broader development benefits, \nsuch as better education, transportation, and food supply. \nWithout\u00a0close community participation, these shared benefits \nwill not be recognized (Box 2.3.6). Recent\u00a0experience from major \nearthquakes and tropical cyclones in Asia emphasizes also the \nimportance of local communities and actors as custodians of local \nknowledge and experience that can be pivotal to the effective \ndelivery of humanitarian response and recovery efforts.\n\nToward maintaining a fair and inclusive process, it must \nbe monitored carefully to see who might be excluded from it. \nThe benefits of the build-back-better process must be received \nby all segments of society, especially the most disadvantaged. \nNoteworthy in this context are the many research projects that \nhave observed recoveries frequently excluding the poorest and \nmost vulnerable (Karim and Noy 2016, Hallegatte et\u00a0al.\u00a02016b, and \nPatankar, forthcoming). Given the overwhelming evidence of how \nrecovery often fails to reach the disadvantaged, it\u00a0is apparent that \nplanning for building back better needs to incorporate ways to \nensure that the weakest segments of society are included and are \nempowered during post-disaster reconstruction.\n\nBuilding back social and economic potential \nPost-disaster recovery should aim to generate potential for \nimproved social well-being and expanded economic opportunity. \nWithout improvement, the quality of life will eventually \ndeteriorate (Sen 2000, Friedman 2006). A\u00a0fair,\u00a0fast,\u00a0and safe \nrecovery does not necessarily mean that the reconstructed city \nor community will have more social and economic potential \nor opportunities than it did before. Yet without that social and \neconomic potential, the build-back strategy will fail. \n\n\f124(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nPolicy should therefore focus not only on the goals of safety, \nspeed, and fairness but also strive to create conditions that will \nensure gainful employment and stronger social ties toward \nimproving community well-being. A cautionary tale might be \nKobe, Japan, where reconstruction after an earthquake in 1995 \nwas fast, safe, and most likely fair, but nevertheless brought a \nreduction in economic opportunity (duPont et al. 2015). \n\nPolicy makers at all levels should strive for a reconstruction \n\nframework that not only preserves previously available \nsocial amenities and economic activity, but aims to move the \ncommunity toward livelihoods that are sustainable over the \nlong term and toward social relationships that can support the \ncommunity for many years to come. In many cases, preserving \nthe economic opportunities and social ties that were there \nbefore the disaster might not even be feasible any more. \nIn\u00a0these cases, it is even more important for the authorities \nto be proactive in identifying and generating conditions that \nwill foster long-term social strength and economic prosperity. \nUltimately, without renewed social and economic potential, \na\u00a0sustainable build-back-better recovery is not possible.\n\nMuch accomplished, much more to do\nThe risks posed by the heightened impact of disasters in \nAsia, especially in the lower-income countries of the region, \nare manifestly real. Damage and losses can propagate across \ntime and space, causing widespread and prolonged adverse \nimpacts on society and the economy. However, citizens, firms, \ncivil\u00a0society, governments, and multilateral institutions can do \na great deal to mitigate the dangers posed by disasters, avert \ntheir consequences, and manage the aftermath. The growing \nseriousness of problem indicates commensurate room for \nimprovement on all fronts. \n\nLow-hanging fruit is ready to be picked: better early \n\nwarning systems for disasters; greater investment in \nprotection\u00a0by, for example, building cyclone or tsunami \nshelters; contingency funds made automatically available after \ntheir triggering events; and more policy attention to planning \nrecovery in advance, rather than having to scramble in the \nemergency phase.\n\nPlenty more can and should be done to initiate change in the \n\nability of societies to pursue the aims of the Sendai Framework \nAgreement, which focuses on four priorities for action:\nPriority 1. Understanding disaster risk.\nPriority 2. Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage \n\ndisaster risk.\n\nPriority 3. Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience.\nPriority 4. Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective \n\nresponse and to build back better during recovery, \nrehabilitation, and reconstruction.\n\n\fStrengthening disaster resilience(cid:29)(cid:29)125\n\nIncreasing attention has been paid to priorities 1 and 2: \nunderstanding disaster risk in developing Asia and dealing \nwith the governance issues that abound in disaster risk \nmanagement. While this is certainly a welcome development \nin the region, and though more needs to be done, other aspects \nof disaster resilience also need to be addressed. As\u00a0this\u00a0chapter \nargues, more attention must now be paid to all four priorities, \nincluding 3 and 4: strengthening countries\u2019 disaster resilience, \nimproving disaster preparedness, and promoting a more \ncomprehensive strategy for reconstruction. Only then can \ncountries ensure a safer, faster, and more inclusive post-\ndisaster recovery\u2014a recovery that can realize economic and \nsocial potential. \n\n\f126(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nBackground papers\nAbrigo, M. and A.

Inflation \naccelerated  somewhat,  and  a  larger  trade  deficit  and  lower  remittances  widened  the \ncurrent  account  deficit.  Continued  fiscal  consolidation  will  mean  slower  growth  in  2019 \nand  2020.  Higher  import  duties  and  excise  taxes  will  bring  more  inflation.  A  wider  trade \ndeficit is expected to keep the current account deficit sizable despite gains in income and \nservice  exports.  Innovation  is  critical  to  ensure  growth. \n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth slowed from an exceptionally strong 7.5% in 2017 to \n5.2% in 2018. On the supply side, services and industry drove \ngrowth as agriculture contracted. Services, providing more \nthan half of output, expanded by 9.6% on improvements in \ntrade, finance, insurance, recreation, transportation, and \nhealth care, though growth was less than the 12.1% rise in \n2017. Growth in industry excluding construction slackened \nfrom 6.6% in 2017 to 4.1% as mining and quarrying output \nplunged by 14.1% because of low international prices for copper, \nuncertainties surrounding a gold mining project, and the \nclosure of Armenia\u2019s second largest copper and molybdenum \nmine. However, growth in manufacturing almost doubled from \n5.9% to 10.1%, supported by strong gains in processed foods, \nbeverages, tobacco, textiles, and nonferrous metal products. \nGrowth in construction slowed from 2.5% in 2017 to 1.6% \nas private construction slumped. Adverse weather caused \nagriculture to contract by 8.5%, compounding a 5.3% drop in \n2017 (Figure 3.1.1).\n\nwere the main sources of growth. Private consumption slowed \nfrom 8.9% in 2017 but still expanded by 5.7%, benefiting from \nlow inflation, increased consumer lending, and a government \ninitiative in July 2018 to write off fines and penalties on overdue \npersonal loans. Public consumption declined by 6.4%, reversing \n13.1% growth in 2017. Despite lower public investment, total \ninvestment expanded by 28.5% on much higher inventories, \nwhich were likely motivated by disruptions and business \nuncertainty stemming from political events in 2018, and on a \n5.0% rise in gross fixed capital formation. The deficit in net \nexports widened further as imports grew faster than exports.\n\nThis chapter was written by Grigor Gyurjyan of the Armenia Resident Mission, \nADB, Yerevan.\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20138\n\n3.1.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nConstruction\nIndustry excluding construction\nServices including indirect taxes\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.5\n\n5.2\n\n3.6\n\n3.2\n\n0.2\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Statistical Committee of Armenia.  \nhttp://www.armstat.am (accessed 25 February 2019).\n\nOverall\nFood\nOther goods\nServices\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nSource: Statistical Committee of Armenia.  \nhttp://www.armstat.am (accessed 25 February 2019).\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption and investment \n\n3.1.2\u2002Inflation\n\n\f144(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nAverage annual inflation rose from 1.0% in 2017 to 2.5% \nin 2018, reflecting higher excise taxes on fuel, liquefied gas, \nbeverages, and cigarettes, as well as increased customs duties \nsince January 2018 for about 200 items under the Customs \nCode of the Eurasian Economic Union. Prices increased by \n2.5% for food, 4.5% for other goods, and 1.2% for services. \nInflation at 1.8% year on year in December 2018 was still well \nbelow the target band of 2.5%\u20135.5% set by the Central Bank of \nArmenia (Figure 3.1.2).\n\nMonetary policy remained steady throughout the year, with \n\nthe policy rate unchanged at 6.00% from February 2017 to the \nend of 2018. As inflation, while rising, stayed moderate, the \ncentral bank trimmed the policy rate to 5.75% in January 2019. \nMonetary expansion slowed sharply from 18.5% in 2017 to \n7.4% last year as net foreign assets tumbled by three-quarters, \nand despite a 12.0% rise in net domestic assets. Credit to the \nprivate sector rose significantly, pushing total credit higher \nby more than 17% in 2018, including an increase of 45.3% for \nconsumers.\n\nIn a 2018 assessment, the International Monetary Fund \nfound Armenia\u2019s financial system stable and noted significant \nprogress in strengthening oversight of the sector, with \nimproved regulation and supervision contributing to financial \ndeepening along with additional capital from shareholders \nand several mergers. Despite improved financial soundness \nindicators, vulnerabilities remain. A high 47.1% of loans and \n60.4% of bank deposits were in foreign currency at the end \nof 2018, and liquidity cushions were inadequate, with foreign \ncurrency loans four times higher than deposits. \n\nFiscal policy remained consistent with the government\u2019s \nmedium-term consolidation objectives of reducing the deficit \nand the high ratio of public debt to GDP. The budget deficit \nnarrowed sharply from 4.8% of GDP in 2017 to 1.8% in 2018, \ngreatly outperforming the budget\u2019s 2.7% target (Figure 3.1.3). \nDomestic sources provided two-thirds of budget financing. \nRevenue rose by 8.3% to equal 22.3% of GDP, reflecting \nbetter tax collection, a new tax code with higher excise taxes \nand customs duties, and increased nontax revenue. Outlays \ndeclined by 3.9 percentage points to equal 24.1% of GDP as \ncapital spending fell 12.2% short of the budget target.

Remittances, measured as net inflow of private \nnoncommercial transfers through banks, fell by 22.1% to $600 \nmillion in 2018. Ruble depreciation cut remittances from the \nRussian Federation by 16.1%, and remittances from other \ncountries plunged even further (Figure 3.1.6). \n\nGross international reserves slumped by 2.8% to $2.2 billion \n\nat the end of 2018, estimated to cover 4.3 months of imports. \nThe Armenian dram remained relatively stable in real effective \nterms but appreciated by 6.0% in nominal effective terms \n(Figure 3.1.7).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is projected to slow to 4.3% in 2019 then recover \nslightly to 4.5% in 2020 (Figure 3.1.8).\n\nRisks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Growth could \n\nstrengthen with improved political stability, following an \neventful 2018, and as a new government pledges to promote \ncompetition, combat corruption, enhance public services, and \nencourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Major downside \nrisks stem from any growth slowdown in 2019 in the Russian \nFederation, Armenia\u2019s main trade partner and destination for \nmigrant workers; weaker mining output and diminished exports \nfrom lower prices for nonferrous metals; and preparations to \nrepay a $500 million eurobond coming due in September 2020.\nOn the supply side, services should be the main driver of \n\nexpansion, with lesser support from agriculture, industry, \nand construction. Services are projected to grow by 6.0% \nin 2019 and 5.5% in 2020, reflecting gains in wholesale and \nretail trade, finance, insurance, recreation, and transport and \ncommunications. Agriculture is projected to rebound by 2.5% in \n2019 and 3.3% in 2020, assuming more normal weather but also \ncontinued government-subsidized loans to farmers for hail nets, \ndrip irrigation, intensive gardening, and leasing, as well as the \nsuccess of a pilot agricultural insurance program that promises \nto encourage planting. Expansion in industry excluding \nconstruction will likely slow to 2.9% in 2019 before recovering \nto 3.6% in 2020. While low international copper prices and \nproblems in mining will again weigh on the output and export \nof minerals, growth could benefit from higher demand for \nprocessed foods, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and footwear from \nEurasian Economic Union partners and the Middle East. Tepid \ncapital spending will likely keep growth in construction modest. \nOn the demand side, growth is expected to slow further for \nboth investment and consumption. Fiscal consolidation including \nlow capital outlays will likely limit gains in public consumption \nand investment, though private consumption and investment \nshould find support in expected increases in remittances and \ntax changes to be implemented in 2019: the introduction of a \n\n3.1.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n\u20024.3\n\n\u20023.5\n\n\u20136.9\n\n\u20024.5\n\n\u20023.2\n\n\u20136.1\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.1.6\u2002Remittances by source\n\nRussian Federation\nUnited States\nRest of the world\n\nGrowth\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nSource: Central Bank of Armenia. http://www.cba.am \n(accessed 25 February 2019).\n\n3.1.7\u2002Reserves and effective exchange rates \n\nGross international reserves\n\nNominal effective\nReal effective\n\n$ billion \n\nIndex, 2010 = 100\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nSources: Central Bank of Armenia. http://www.cba.am; \nInternational Monetary Fund.

The deficit in net exports is expected to widen further as \nexports grow more slowly than imports.\n\nMonetary policy will aim to support economic growth \nwhile curbing inflation. Despite slower growth, average annual \ninflation is projected to accelerate to 3.5% in 2019, boosted \nby higher customs duties for about 560 items imported from \ncountries outside the Eurasian Economic Union, a 10% price \nrise for imported gas beginning in January 2019, and expected \nincreases in excise taxes for fuel, beverages, and cigarettes in \nthe second half of 2019. Inflation is seen moderating to 3.2% in \n2020 as the effects of these factors abate.\n\nFiscal policy will remain tight under fiscal consolidation \n\nthat includes planned government restructuring and \nthe rationalization of some agencies that will likely trim \nemployment in several ministries. The 2019 budget projects a \nfiscal deficit equal to 2.2% of GDP as revenue rises by 14.4% and \nexpenditure by only 12.5%. Planned revisions to the tax code \nin the second half of the year should boost revenue collection \nby strengthening tax administration and enlarging the tax \nbase, but preparations to repay the $500\u00a0million eurobond in \nSeptember 2020 will pose a serious fiscal challenge. In addition, \npublic debt engaged in 2018 but drawn\u00a0down in 2019 will likely \nraise total public debt to about 58% of GDP.\n\nThe current account deficit is projected to widen slightly \nto 6.9% of GDP in 2019 before narrowing to 6.1% in 2020 as \nhigher income and service exports offset continued expansion \nof the trade deficit (Figure 3.1.9). Export growth is projected to \nslip further to 6.0% in 2019 and then recover to 8.5% in 2020 \non higher exports of agricultural products, textiles, precious \nstones, and metal products, even as mineral earnings remain \nweak. Import growth will likely moderate to 8.2% in 2019 \nand 6.5% in 2020 but continue to outpace growth in exports \nas demand grows for consumer and capital goods. Gains in \ntourism and information technology (IT) will buoy net service \ninflows, while rising remittances are expected to boost net \nincome and current transfers.

Remittances and exports of commodities \nmay fuel growth, but they are vulnerable to external shocks. \nArmenia has responded by diversifying its export base, yet \nexports of goods with high value added remain small.

While Armenia scores well on international \nco-invention, patent applications, and buyer sophistication, \nit compares less favorably on workforce diversity, research \nand development (R&D) spending, the quality of its research \ninstitutions, and its use of cluster development. Addressing these \nissues and promoting a knowledge-based economy depends on the \nsuccessful implementation of comprehensive education, science, \ntechnology, and innovation policies. Among key government \nobjectives are upgrading Armenia\u2019s scientific infrastructure, \nensuring a steady rise in the number of highly skilled workers, \nstrengthening innovation, and internationalizing science and \ninnovation. Specific targets for certain objectives appear in an \ninnovation concept paper the government approved in 2011 and \nin other documents, notably Strategy on Development of Science \n2011\u20132020 and Science and Technology Priorities 2015\u20132029. \nSuccessful policy implementation requires an enabling \nenvironment, support for human capital development, aid for \nR&D and innovation in private firms, and more integrated \ninnovation systems. As human capital is especially important, \ninnovation capacity depends crucially on the quality of education, \nparticularly in science and technology, and the availability of \nworkers with the necessary technical skills. Armenia has made \nconsiderable progress, and IT-related services now provide more \nthan 11% of service exports, 16% of all services, and 5% of GDP. \nContinued rapid expansion in IT depends on enhanced education \nto meet the industry\u2019s growing demand for highly skilled workers. \nIn particular, the quality of science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics education must be improved by modernizing \nteaching and learning materials and by going beyond existing \ninitiatives and projects to develop and promote techno-parks, \ninnovation incubators, R&D centers opened and operated by \nglobal\u00a0companies, IT classes, school engineering labs, and after-\nschool learning platforms.\n\nThough Armenia\u2019s skills base is evolving, R&D capacity \nand efforts still lag. R&D spending equaled only 0.3% of GDP \nin 2018, or barely one-six of the 1.8% average in upper-middle-\nincome economies. Measures to support innovation must be \ncomprehensively inventoried before they can be streamlined \nand reoriented. Flexible financing arrangements that include \nincentives and other cost-effective support could allow firms to \nimprove their performance and become more willing to undertake \nthe risks inherent in developing new products and services. \nThe government is providing R&D and physical facilities for \ntechnology-based firms through a program called Engineering \nCity and Engineering Cluster, designed to help firms and \nuniversities combine their efforts to commercialize research \nproducts and catalyze the growth of high-tech companies.\n\n\fAzerbaijan\n\nGDP  growth  strengthened  in  2018  as  expansion  in  services  and  agriculture  continued, \nand  as  industry  contracted  less.  Exchange  rate  stability  tamed  inflation,  and  higher  oil \nprices widened the current account surplus. Growth is forecast to inch higher in 2019 and \n2020  on  expanded  public  spending,  gas  production,  and  output  aside  from  petroleum, \nwith inflation rebounding slightly in both years and higher gas exports further widening the \ncurrent  account  surplus.  Improving  infrastructure  is  a  priority.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth accelerated from a negligible 0.1% in 2017 to 1.4% on \ngains of 0.6% in the dominant petroleum sector and 1.8% in the \nrest of the economy (Figure 3.2.1).\n\nOn the supply side, industry contracted by 0.4%, improving \n\nconsiderably on 3.6% decline in 2017 with recovery in \nmining and 7.9% growth in manufacturing largely offsetting \na steep drop in construction. Mining expanded by 0.4%, \nreversing 4.6% decline in 2017, as the beginning of supply \nfrom Shah\u00a0Deniz\u00a02\u00a0field boosted gas production by 7.1%. \nLower\u00a0capital outlays with the completion of major public \ninvestment projects deepened contraction in construction from \n1.5% in 2017 to 9.0%. Agriculture expanded from 4.2% in 2017 \nto 4.6%, reflecting government support to farmers, particularly \nfor crop production, which rose by 6.8%. Growth in services \nremained at 3.5% with gains in tourism and transportation. \nOn the demand side, 9 months\u2019 data show a 12.0% rise \n\nin consumption, including 13.0% expansion in private \nconsumption as household incomes increased. Total investment \ncontracted by 0.2%\u2014though an estimate for the full year \nshows total investment rising. Net exports tripled as exports \noutgrew\u00a0imports.\n\nAverage annual inflation plunged from 12.9% in 2017 to \n2.3%, and core inflation to 1.8%, thanks to higher prices for oil \nexports and tightened control over the amount of currency in \ncirculation to stabilize the exchange rate (Figure 3.2.2). With\u00a0a \ndecline in more expensive imported food, price rises for food \nslowed from 16.4% in 2017 to 1.7%, for other goods from 11.6% \nto 2.6%, and for services from 9.3% to 2.7% (Figure\u00a03.2.3). \n\nExpansionary fiscal policy saw expenditure increase from \n\nthe equivalent of 25.1% of GDP in 2017 to 28.5%, mainly for \ninvestment (Figure 3.2.4). Revenue rose from 23.5% of GDP \n\nThis chapter was written by Nail Valiyev of the Azerbaijan Resident Mission, \nADB, Baku.\n\n3.2.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n2.8\n\n1.1\n\n0.1\n\n1.4\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n\u20133.1\n2016\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the \nRepublic\u00a0of\u00a0Azerbaijan. \n\n3.2.2\u2002Inflation and exchange rate\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nMonthly average\nexchange rate\n\n% change year on year\n\nManat/$\n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2.4\n\n1.8\n\n1.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the  \nRepublic of Azerbaijan. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nAzerbaijan\u2002\u2002149\n\nin\u00a02017 to 28.1% on an 80% rise in transfers from the State Oil \nFund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), the sovereign wealth fund, and \non reform to tax and customs administration that improved tax \nrevenue by 13.3%. Higher revenue trimmed the budget deficit \nalmost to zero, from 1.6% of GDP in 2017 to 0.4%. However, the \ndeficit excluding SOFAZ transfers remained substantial, rising \nfrom 10.3% of GDP in 2017 to 14.1%. Debt service payments of \nboth interest and principal soared by 47.0% as the government \nopted to prepay a portion of more expensive external debt. \nExternal public and publicly guaranteed debt consequently fell \nfrom the equivalent of 22.8% of GDP at the end of 2017 to 19.0% \na year later, partly reflecting a new strategy adopted in 2018 to \nrein in public debt. \n\nMonetary policy continued to prioritize price stability. \n\nSuccess in reducing inflation nevertheless allowed the \nCentral\u00a0Bank of Azerbaijan to cut the policy rate from 15.00% \nto 9.75% in four rounds during 2018 and to 9.25% in January \n2019. Broad money growth slowed from 9.0% in 2017 to 5.7% \n(Figure\u00a03.2.5). Banks continued to face challenges as the \npercentage of nonperforming loans remained high at 12.2%, \nthough efforts to address the problem brought a reduction \nfrom 13.8% a year earlier. Confidence in the Azerbaijan manat \ncontinued to firm, as indicated by the share of local currency \ndeposits rising from 27.6% at the end of 2017 to 34.6% a year \nlater, and the share of local currency loans rising from 59.1% to \n62.0%. With greater exchange rate stability and more consumer \nconfidence, the supply of credit grew by 10.7%, reversing 28.5% \ncontraction in 2017.\n\nThe current account surplus was estimated to have \nnearly doubled from the equivalent of 3.6% of GDP in the \nfirst 9\u00a0months of 2017 to 6.9% in the same period of 2018. \nHigher\u00a0oil prices raised the full-year trade surplus to 16.0% \nof GDP and doubled export growth from 17.9% in 2017 to \n35.9% as hydrocarbons continued to account for more than \n90% of all exports, with other exports expanding as well. \nImport growth jumped from 1.6% in 2017 to 32.1%. With the \ncompletion of hydrocarbon construction projects, the deficit \nin services fell from $3.4 billion in 2017 to $1.3 billion, even \nas profit transfers by foreign petroleum investors widened \nthe income deficit from $1.2 billion in 2017 to $1.5 billion. \nGrowth in neighboring countries, particularly the Russian \nFederation, buoyed remittances by 10.7% to $600 million. \nNet\u00a0foreign direct investment in the first 9 months of 2018 was \n$1.0 billion, up\u00a0from $800 million in the same period of 2017. \nForeign\u00a0exchange reserves rose by $300 million to $5.6\u00a0billion \nat the end of 2018, which was cover for an estimated \n3.8\u00a0months of imported goods and services.

Construction is expected to expand \nby 3.0% in 2019 to accommodate additional government \nprograms for agriculture and housing and by 2.0% in 2020 \nwith the implementation of regional development programs. \nAgriculture is projected to expand by 3.0% in 2019 and by 4.0% \nin 2020 as farmers\u2019 access to finance improves. Growth in \nservices is projected at 3.0% in both 2019 and 2020 on gains in \ntransportation, tourism, and retail trade.\n\nOn the demand side, a higher government salary bill will \nboost public consumption, while higher effective household \nincome from growth should fuel private consumption, \nespecially as inflation stays fairly moderate. A stable exchange \nrate and the implementation of economic reform to improve the \nbusiness climate are projected to boost private investment, and \nmore expansionary fiscal policy will raise public investment. \nNet exports will rise on higher hydrocarbon exports and lower \nimports, particularly in 2019 as higher customs duties suppress \nimports of machinery and automobiles, which together \naccounted for 36% of all imports in 2017.\n\nInflation is projected to accelerate to 4.0% in 2019 in line \n\nwith higher salaries and, as faster growth boosts domestic \ndemand, reach 5.0% in 2020 (Figure 3.2.8). A relatively stable \nexchange rate should prevent high inflation.\n\nOver the next 2 years, the central bank is expected to \nfocus on two objectives: maintaining exchange rate stability \nand limiting inflation to 5.0%. The authorities will therefore \nclosely monitor import demand, foreign exchange movements, \nand capital flows. A stable exchange rate is expected to boost \nlending to the private sector. If the inflation target is attained, \nthe central bank can be expected to ease the policy interest \nrate further.\n\nFiscal policy is expected to become more expansionary, \nwith the state budget deficit including SOFAZ transfers rising \nnotably to 2.8% of GDP in 2019 before narrowing again to \n2.0% in 2020. Deficit financing will come from privatization \nproceeds, domestic and external borrowing, and unused \nbalances in Treasury accounts. The deficit excluding SOFAZ \ntransfers will equal 18.6% of GDP in 2019 and 16.9% in 2020. \nRevenue is forecast to reach the equivalent of 32.2% of GDP \nin 2019 and 33.2% in 2020 as higher gas shipments boost \nhydrocarbon revenue and increased customs tariffs and other \ntax changes raise revenue from the rest of the economy. \n\n3.2.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20024.0\n\n13.6\n\n\u20022.7\n\n\u20025.0\n\n10.8\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.2.6\u2002 State oil fund assets and \ncentral bank reserves\n\nCentral bank reserves\nState Oil Fund of Azerbaijan assets\nTotal\n\n$ billion\n\n50.9\n\n38.6\n\n37.1\n\n41.1\n\n44.2\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nState\u00a0Oil Fund of Azerbaijan. http://www.oilfund.az \n(accessed 11 March 2019).\n\n3.2.7\u2002 GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2014 2015 2016\n\n2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n%\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nAzerbaijan\u2002\u2002151\n\nExpenditure is forecast to equal 35.0% of GDP in 2019 and \n35.2% in 2020, reflecting a 38% rise in the minimum wage \nand minimum pension, general pay increases in 2019, and a \nnew regional development program in 2020 that will expand \ncurrent and capital outlays alike.

Imports are seen recovering by 11.1% in 2020 to meet \nrising domestic demand as the impact of these tariffs wanes. \nThe\u00a0deficit in services is projected to narrow further by 6.7% \nin 2019 and 7.1% in 2020 as construction on Shah Deniz 2 ends. \nHowever, the income deficit may widen further in 2019 and \n2020 as foreign investors repatriate more of their hydrocarbon \nearnings.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014improving infrastructure\nAzerbaijan\u2019s oil wealth has fostered considerable social and \neconomic development. While enabling rapid economic \ngrowth, hydrocarbon earnings have created an economy overly \ndependent on the petroleum industry. Toward diversifying the \neconomy, the government has used much of the hydrocarbon \nearnings, including SOFAZ transfers, to rebuild and modernize \nSoviet-era infrastructure. From 2003 to 2017, investment \nin public infrastructure excluding oil and gas averaged the \nequivalent of 6.6% of non-hydrocarbon GDP. Maintaining and \nexpanding this infrastructure is a continuing challenge.\n\nCapital investments have so far focused on reconstructing \nand expanding road and railway networks, ports, and electric \npower plants. Most investment has gone into improving the \ncountry\u2019s east\u2013west and north\u2013south transport corridors \ntoward fashioning Azerbaijan as a major transit and trade \nhub. Despite the creation of good transport and electric power \nnetworks, along with massive investments in other public \nutilities, critical gaps in infrastructure remain. Investment \nis still needed to replace and upgrade infrastructure for \nagriculture, rail transport, tourism, and information \ntechnology, among other needs. The government has estimated \nthat investment of nearly $7 billion, equal to 4.7% of GDP, \nis\u00a0required during 2017\u20132020 for these purposes.\n\n3.2.8\u2002Inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving\naverage\n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n3.2.9\u2002 Current account balance\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n% of GDP\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n\fAs state-owned enterprises have limited financial capacity, \n\n3.2.10\u2002 Budget transfers and \n\ncapital\u00a0expenditure\n\nState Oil Fund of Azerbaijan transfers\nCapital expenditure\n\n% of GDP\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance.

However, public investment \nspending generally tracks hydrocarbon revenue. Capital\u00a0outlays \nin the central budget declined from the equivalent of 12% \nof GDP in 2015 to 7% in 2016 as prices for hydrocarbons \nfell. They\u00a0remained near 7% of GDP in 2017 but rose to 11% \nin 2018 with much higher SOFAZ transfers (Figure 3.2.10). \nThe\u00a0long-term sustainability of existing assets is a concern, \nand\u00a0utility tariffs set by the government should be adjusted to \ncover operating costs.\n\nThe government needs to establish a robust system for \nmanaging public investment that will individually appraise \nthe economic and financial viability of proposed projects, \nstrengthen project implementation capacity, improve project \nmonitoring and evaluation, and adopt a framework for \ncomprehensively assessing project results. It has adopted a \nmedium-term expenditure framework to ensure that adequate \nfunds are allocated to maintain infrastructure once it is built. \nHowever, due attention will be needed to link the investment \nprogram with that framework to ensure that resources are \nprovided in a timely fashion for infrastructure operation and \nmaintenance. \n\nTo facilitate private investment in public infrastructure, \n\nThe National Assembly adopted in 2016 a law on special \nfinancing for infrastructure investment projects that promotes \nthe build\u2013operate\u2013transfer model, in which private firms \nconstruct infrastructure projects, operate them for a specified \nperiod to recoup their investment, and then hand them over \nto the government. An adequate legal framework is still \nneeded, as is the acquisition of appropriate skills, to develop \nfeasible\u00a0projects for private financing and management. \nWhile\u00a0state-financed infrastructure projects will remain \ndominant, private\u00a0participation in selected areas can make \nservice provision more efficient and competitive.\n\nEnhanced skills will be important as well for maintaining \n\ninfrastructure. Infrastructure expansion and the mastery \nof new technology will require better training facilities, \ncurriculum, methods, and certification programs. \nStakeholders,\u00a0especially in agriculture and information \ntechnology, will need to adopt technology and comply \nwith quality standards and certification requirements. \nStrengthened\u00a0skills can help maintain existing infrastructure \nand promote investment in worthwhile new projects. \n\n\fGeorgia\n\nRising  external  demand  in  2018  kept  growth  unchanged  despite  lower  fiscal  spending. \nInflation fell by more than half, and rapid tourism and export growth narrowed the current \naccount  deficit.  Growth  is  projected  to  rise  in  2019  with  higher  investment  spending, \nthen  moderate  slightly  in  2020.  Inflation  will  be  slightly  higher.  Workforce  skills  must  be \nimproved  to  attract  investment  into  more  diverse  and  remunerative  activities.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth continued at 4.8% in 2018 thanks to rising exports \nand tourism and despite slower expansion in infrastructure \nprojects and worsening regional volatility, notably in \nneighboring Turkey. On the supply side, growth in industry \nslowed sharply from 6.4% in 2017 to 2.3% as a 2.5% decline in \nconstruction from lower capital spending offset gains of 4.1% \nin manufacturing and 10.8% in mining. Meanwhile, growth \nin services accelerated from 5.1% in 2017 to 5.9% on strong \ngains of 4.5% in trade, 17.9% in finance, and 9.8% in real estate. \nAgriculture rebounded from 3.8% contraction in 2017 to 0.4% \ngrowth as crop production improved with better weather \n(Figure 3.3.1). \n\nOn the demand side, estimated growth in consumption \nnearly tripled from 0.5% in 2017 to 1.4% as higher incomes \nincreased private consumption by 2.5%, while public \nconsumption fell by 2.5%. Growth in investment is estimated \nto have risen from 3.8% to 4.8% despite a slowdown in public \ninvestment. However, the estimated rise in net exports, \nwhile high, slowed from 20.1% to 17.8% as growth in exports \ndiminished and expansion in imports accelerated. \n\nAverage inflation fell by more than half from 6.0% in 2017 \n\nto 2.6% as the impact of higher excise taxes implemented \nin\u00a02017 waned and the Georgian lari appreciated against the \nTurkish lira, easing prices for imported goods, in particular \nclothing and footwear. Inflation slowed for food from 6.8% \nin 2017 to 2.2%, for other goods from 5.0% to 1.3%, and for \nservices from 4.7% to 2.4%. Some prices rose more quickly: for \nhealth care by 4.8% and, following electricity and water tariff \nincreases in January 2018, for utilities by 4.3% (Figure 3.3.2). \nCore inflation excluding food and energy slowed from 4.0% in \n2017 to 1.7%. \n\n3.3.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n4.6\n\n2.9\n\n2.8\n\n4.8\n\n4.8\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: National Statistics Office of Georgia.  \nhttp://www.geostat.ge (accessed 22 February 2019).\n\n3.3.2\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nHeadline\nFood\nOther goods\nServices\n\n% change year on year\n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: National Statistics Office of Georgia.  \nhttp://www.geostat.ge (accessed 7 March 2019).\n\nThis chapter was written by George Luarsabishvili of the Georgia Resident Mission, \nADB, Tbilisi.\n\n\f154(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nPrudent fiscal policy in 2018 helped narrow the deficit from \n\n3.3.3\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nthe equivalent of 0.9% of GDP in 2017 to 0.8% (Figure 3.3.3). \nTax collections were limited by accelerated refunds to firms \nof value-added tax estimated to equal 1.3% of GDP, causing \ntax revenue to fall from 25.8% of GDP to 25.4%\u2014a smaller \ndecline than expected\u2014and trimming total revenue from 28.9% \nof GDP to 28.6%.

Total expenditure declined from 29.7% of \nGDP in 2017 to 29.4%.

The National Bank of Georgia, \nthe central bank, reduced its policy rate by 0.25 percentage \npoints in July 2018 to 7.0% and further to 6.75% in January \n2019 as economic activity slowed, demand pressures on \ninflation abated, and the lari strengthened in nominal effective \nterms faster than expected with currency depreciation in \nthe Russian Federation and Turkey. Tighter restrictions on \nlending contained borrowing, keeping credit growth broadly \nstable at 22.7% and slowing broad money growth marginally \nto 14.7% (Figure 3.3.4). Measures launched in 2017 to reverse \ndollarization held the share of loans in foreign currency at \n56.1%, down from 56.3% in 2017.\n\nBanks remained well capitalized, liquid, and profitable with \n\na capital adequacy ratio of 18.4%, return on equity of 23.3%, \nand return on assets at 3.0%. Nonperforming loans declined \nslightly from 2.8% of all credit in 2017 to 2.7%. Interest rates \non Treasury securities decreased to 7.2%. Corporate debt was \nstable at 27.9% of GDP in 2018, but household debt continued to \nclimb, reaching 33.7% (Figure 3.3.5). \n\nRapid export growth narrowed the current account deficit \n\nfrom the equivalent of 8.8% of GDP in 2017 to 8.0% despite \nhigher profit repatriation. Exports of goods and services \njumped by 18.5%, with receipts from tourism up by 18.4%, as \ndemand increased from markets other than Turkey, where an \neconomic crisis cut into Georgia\u2019s receipts from trade, tourism, \nand remittances. Imports expanded by 14.6% on rising oil \nprices earlier in the year.

A rebound in construction is projected to boost \ngrowth in industry to 5.9% this year, easing to 5.4% next year. \nHigher investment should accelerate growth in agriculture to \n2.6% and then 2.8% with favorable weather. \n\nInflation is projected to accelerate somewhat to 3.2% \nin 2019 before slowing again to 3.0% in 2020 (Figure 3.3.8). \nFurther tightening of credit standards should cut credit growth \nto 13.0% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2020. Bread price increases \nbeginning in December 2018 and higher excise taxes on \ntobacco may add to inflationary pressures. Inflation could also \nbe higher if economic growth or prices for petroleum or food \nexceed expectations, or if the lari depreciates further because \nof monetary tightening in the US or Europe. \n\nWith little change in growth and less imported inflation \n\nas global expansion slows, a gradual transition to an \naccommodative monetary policy is expected.

Net exports also increased as exports of \ngoods and services rose by 8.9% and imports by only 3.7%. \nDespite significant local currency depreciation in the \nsecond half of 2018 and heightened inflationary expectations, \naverage inflation slowed from 7.4% in 2017 to 6.0% as the \nNational Bank of Kazakhstan, the central bank, issued state-\nbacked securities to absorb liquidity and bring inflation within \nits target range of 5%\u20137%. Price increases for food slowed from \n8.6% in 2017 to 5.1%, and for other goods from 8.4% to 7.8%, \nthough increases for services edged up from 5.1% to 5.3%. \nIn\u00a0December 2018, inflation was 5.3% year on year, near the \nlower bound of the central bank\u2019s target range (Figure 3.4.2). \n\nThis chapter was written by Genadiy Rau of the Kazakhstan Resident Mission, \nADB, Astana.\n\n3.4.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nServices\nIndustry\nConstruction\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n4.2\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Republic of Kazakhstan.

After currency \ndepreciation resumed, however, the central bank sold \nforeign exchange worth $520.6 million in September, its first \nintervention since 2017, and increased the policy rate to 9.25% \nin October. Despite these moves, the tenge depreciated by \nnearly 16% against the US dollar in 2018 to reach an all-time \nlow of T384.2 per dollar at the end of the year. During\u00a0this \nperiod, the tenge moved in line with the ruble and the \ncurrencies of neighboring economies, which depreciated in \nresponse to worsening geopolitical tensions and rising US \ninterest rates. \n\nBroad money (M3) expanded by 7.0% as deposits grew by \n\n16.1% and credit by 3.1%, reversing 1.7% contraction in 2017, \nwhen deposits fell by 3.0% and credit by 0.2% (Figure\u00a03.4.3). \nCredit to households rose by 16.8% in 2018, but loans to firms \ndeclined by 4.6%. Currency fluctuation helped raise the \nshare of foreign currency deposits from 47.7% of all deposits \nin December 2017 to 48.4% a year later, though the share \nof foreign currency loans dropped from 26.3% of the loan \nportfolio to 22.9% (Figure 3.4.4). \n\nThe state budget recorded a deficit equal to 1.4% of GDP, \n\ndown from 2.7% in 2017 (Figure 3.4.5). Higher petroleum \nearnings and improved tax administration boosted tax revenue \nby 15.8% to equal 13.4% of GDP, and total revenue to 18.4% of \nGDP, well above projections. Expenditure fell by 9.1% to equal \n19.3% of GDP as government outlays for bank recapitalization \ndeclined from 4.0% of GDP in 2017 to 1.7%. The non-oil state \nbudget deficit narrowed from 10.4% of GDP in 2017 to 9.0%. \nGovernment and government-guaranteed debt rose from 26.3% \nof GDP at the end of 2017 to 27.3%. Meanwhile, state-owned \nenterprises cut their debt from 27.0% of GDP in 2017 to an \nestimated 22.1% as oil and gas enterprises made major debt \nrepayments during the year. \n\nThe current account recorded a surplus, equal to 0.5% \nof GDP, for the first time since 2014, reversing a 3.3% deficit \nin 2017. Rising oil prices and volumes boosted merchandise \nexports by 25.2% from the equivalent of 30.3% of GDP in 2017 \nto 36.3%, while imports rose by 7.5%, climbing from 19.7% of \nGDP in 2017 to 20.2% as private consumption rose and demand \nincreased for capital goods to supply oil and gas projects and \nstate development programs. The service balance improved \nslightly, but primary income deteriorated as profit repatriation \nby foreign investors rose by 29.6% to $20.2 billion. Net foreign \ndirect investment, mainly into oil and mining, rose by 9.8% to \n$4.1\u00a0billion, while net outflows of portfolio investment reached \n$5.8\u00a0billion, reflecting repayment of eurobonds by resident oil \nand gas companies. \n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n%\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n28\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n\u20137\n\n3.4.3\u2002Growth in broad money\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n3.4.4\u2002Dollarization in the banking system\n\nShare of deposits\nShare of loans\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n3.4.5\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nRevenue\nExpenditure\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance; Ministry of National Economy.\n\n\f160(cid:1)(cid:1)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nWith net central bank sales of $520.6 million in foreign \n\nexchange in September 2018 to support the tenge, gross \ninternational reserves declined by $70 million during the \nyear to $30.9 billion, or cover for 8.1 months of imports \n(Figure 3.4.6). Assets in the National Fund of the Republic \nof Kazakhstan (NFRK), the sovereign wealth fund, declined \nby 1.1% to $57.7 billion, and external debt\u201463.4% of which \nis private intercompany debt\u2014eased from the equivalent of \n102.7% of GDP at the end of 2017 to an estimated 94.7% a year \nlater (Figure 3.4.7). In November, investors bought \u20ac1.05 billion \nin euro-denominated Kazakh bonds, half paying 1.550% over \n5 years and half paying 2.375% over 10 years. Demand for the \nbonds was three times the amount offered. \n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is forecast to slow to 3.5% in 2019 and 3.3% in 2020, \nreflecting mainly lower oil prices and slower growth in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation \n(Figure\u00a03.4.8). State investment is expected to become a key \nsource of growth aside from oil in the coming years.\n\nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to expand by \n4.3% in 2019 and 4.4% in 2020 as state-led investment in \nmanufacturing and utilities partly offsets slower gains in \noil production. Oil production will likely decline in the \nfirst half of 2019 to meet Kazakhstan\u2019s commitments under \nproduction constraints agreed with the Organization of the \nPetroleum Exporting Countries, and to accommodate planned \nmaintenance on the country\u2019s three major oilfields, then \nrecover in the second half and expand in 2020 despite lower \naverage oil prices. \n\nGovernment housing and infrastructure modernization \n\nprograms will support construction, which is forecast to \nexpand by 3.4% in 2019 and 3.5% in 2020. Services are \nprojected to grow by 3.2% and then 2.7%, buoyed by a 50% \nrise in the minimum wage in January 2019 that should boost \nhousehold income in 2019 but have limited effect in 2020. \nAgriculture is forecast to expand by 3.0% in 2019 and 2.5% \nin 2020 on strong state support for livestock expansion, crop \ndiversification, and measures to boost agricultural productivity \nand exports, with substantial nonperforming loans (NPLs) in \nagriculture limiting further expansion. In 2018, Kazakhstan\u2019s \nUnified Pension Savings Fund bought $1.2 billion in NPLs \nfrom KazAgro, the state agency that promotes agricultural \ndevelopment. \n\nOn the demand side, growth in consumption is projected \nto slow to 1.3% this year and 1.0% next as continued\u00a0declines \nin public consumption more than offset gains in private \nconsumption spurred by higher household income. \n\n3.4.6\u2002 Foreign currency reserves \nand oil fund  assets\n\nGross international reserves\nAssets of the national oil fund\nTotal international assets\n\n$ billion\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n% of GDP\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n%\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n3.4.7\u2002External debt\n\nExternal debt\nDebt excluding \nintercompany loans\n\nExchange rate\n\nT/$\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: National Bank of Kazakhstan; ADB estimates.\n\n3.4.8\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nKazakhstan\u2002\u2002161\n\nExpansion\u00a0in investment is similarly projected to slow, to 1.8% \nin\u00a02019 and 1.6% in 2020, as further reductions in transfers \nfrom the NFRK constrain government capital spending. \nNet exports are forecast to rise gradually, by 1.0% in 2019 \nand 2.0% in\u00a02020, as moderate increases in oil production \nbeginning in the second half of 2019 outpace rising imports for \nindustrialization programs and higher household purchases of \nimported\u00a0services.\n\nAverage inflation is projected to remain in 2019 at 6.0%, \nthe upper end of the central bank\u2019s target range for the year, \nthen moderate to 5.5% in 2020 (Figure 3.4.9). The central \nbank will likely raise the policy rate and maintain measures \nto absorb excess liquidity to counter inflationary pressures \nimposed by higher import prices as the tenge depreciates. \nFood price inflation is projected to slow from 5.2% in 2019 \nto 5.0% in 2020 as the government promotes domestic food \nproduction, institutes stabilization funds for critical foodstuffs, \nand imposes selective price controls. A review of utility \nprices ordered by the President in November 2018 prompted \nconsiderable reductions in 2019 utility charges. Further \ngovernment intervention in utilities, and in the gasoline \nmarket, should trim inflation for goods other than food to 7.3% \nin 2019 and 6.5% in 2020. Price rises for services will slow from \n5.8% in 2019 to 5.2% in 2020.\n\nFiscal policy is expected to remain slightly expansionary \n\nin the next 2 years. State budget deficits are projected to \nequal 1.5% of GDP in 2019 and 1.3% in 2020, with the non-oil \ndeficit narrowing to 7.0% of GDP in 2019 and 6.5% in 2020 \n(Figure\u00a03.4.10). Revenue is projected to fall to 17.0% of GDP \nin 2019 and 17.7% in 2020. This reflects a policy to reduce \nNFRK transfers to the budget to $6.7 billion in 2019 and \n$6.0 billion in 2020, as well as a tax amnesty for small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) intended to get more firms \nto start reporting income. A separate effort aims to improve \ntax administration. Expenditure is forecast to fall to 18.5% \nof GDP in 2019 and then recover to 19.0% in 2020 on modest \ncivil service pay increases as programs continue to support \nindustrialization, infrastructure, housing, and agriculture. \nEconomic growth will trim government and government-\nguaranteed debt to 26.0% of GDP in 2019 and 25.0% in 2020. \n\nBroad money is projected to increase by only 5.0% annually \nin 2019 and 2020 as the central bank continues to drain excess \nliquidity. A relatively high NPL rate, officially 7.9% at the \nend of 2018 but possibly higher because of underreporting, \nwill constrain credit growth despite efforts to resolve NPLs \nthrough mergers and closures of problem banks. Although \nKazakhstan has a floating exchange rate, the central bank may \nintervene in the market to smooth exchange rate volatility and \nlimit opportunities for cross-currency arbitrage with the ruble, \nwhich historically has been closely linked with the tenge.\n\n%\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20133\n\n3.4.9\u2002Inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n3.4.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n\u20023.5\n\n\u20026.0\n\n\u20130.8\n\n\u20023.3\n\n\u20025.5\n\n\u20131.2\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.4.10\u2002Fiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n\f162(cid:1)(cid:1)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nThe current account is forecast to revert to a deficit \nin\u00a02019, equal to 0.8% of GDP and then 1.2% in 2020, with \nlower global petroleum prices and higher profit repatriation \nby foreign investors (Figure 3.4.11). Despite a slowdown in the \nfirst half of the year, exports are projected to grow by 6.0% \nin 2019 and 7.0% in 2020 after oilfield modernization boosts \nproduction. Growth in imports will slow to 5.0% in 2019 \nand\u00a02020, reflecting measures to promote import substitution \nand, as the tenge depreciates, weaker domestic purchasing \npower. Currency depreciation will also trim the service deficit \nin\u00a02019 and 2020 by reducing demand for imported services \nand facilitating service exports, especially after the completion \nof major road construction projects intended to strengthen \nKazakhstan\u2019s position as a transport and logistics hub.\n\nInternational reserves are projected to turn around and \nreach $31.5 billion this year and then $32.4 billion, or cover \nfor 10 months of imports. With smaller transfers to the budget \nand a reasonable projection for commodity exports, NFRK \nassets are forecast to rise to $59.5 billion at the end of 2019 and \n$60.7\u00a0billion a year later, with external debt at the equivalent of \n98.0% of GDP at the end of 2019 and 95.0% a year\u00a0later.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014addressing \nnonperforming loans\nA healthy banking system is a prerequisite for expanding \nprivate enterprise and ensuring sustainable economic \ndevelopment in Kazakhstan. Before the global financial crisis, \nwhen the economy was expanding rapidly, the bank sector \nwas considered an engine of dynamism, innovation, and \neconomic growth. A decade later, numerous bank failures and \na proliferation of mainly underreported NPLs have left the \nsector\u2019s survival dependent on state support and continuous \ninjections of liquidity. \n\nKazakhstan\u2019s massive NPL problem stems largely \nfrom fraud and loans to connected parties. The leading \ncase in the past decade saw the prosecution of senior and \nmiddle management at Bank Turan Alem, then the largest \ndomestic bank. It was nationalized in 2009 and sold to \nKazkommertsbank in 2014, with net government support \nestimated at $10 billion. In mid-2018, that bank was merged \nwith Halyk Bank, a deal made possible by additional \ngovernment capitalization of $7 billion. In addition, the \nProblem Loans Fund purchased $1.3 billion in troubled \nassets from Tsesnabank in September 2018 and an additional \n$1.6\u00a0billion in agricultural loans in February 2019.\n\nA policy to limit NPLs to 10% of the commercial banks\u2019 \ntotal loan portfolios may have contributed to underreporting. \n\n3.4.11\u2002Current account balance\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n% of GDP\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\n\u20139\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n3.4.12\u2002 Lending portfolio and share of \n\nnonperforming loans\n\nLoans\n\nNonperforming loans\n\n$ billion\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSource: National Bank of Kazakhstan.\n\n%\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nKazakhstan\u2002\u2002163\n\n3.4.13\u2002 Shares of SME and consumer credit \n\nin the lending portfolio\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises\nConsumer credit\n\n%\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises.\nSource: National Bank of Kazakhstan.\n\nIn May 2018, the central bank acknowledged that NPLs in 2017 \nwere actually 23% of the loan total, two and a half times the \nofficially reported 9.3% (Figure 3.4.12). The underreporting \nof NPLs appears to have continued in 2018. For example, the \ncentral bank reported Eximbank NPLs at 3.6% in April 2018, \nbut only 5 months later determined that they were 53.7% and \nrevoked Eximbank\u2019s license. \n\nExtensive NPLs, along with the restructuring of loan \nportfolios and the closure of several banks, have severely \nlimited lending to firms, especially SMEs, despite substantial \nstate support to banks, hindering private investment. \nLoans\u00a0to\u00a0SMEs fell by 12.2% in 2018, following a 1.1% decline \nin 2017, while the share of loans to SMEs declined to 33.6% in \nDecember 2018, well below the average of 44.0% in member \ncountries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (Figure 3.4.13). This happened despite \ngovernment subsidies of up to 50% on interest for business \nloans made within the framework of the Business Road Map \napproved in 2010. The central bank\u2019s tight monetary policy, \nwhich kept average rates for business loans at 12.5% in 2018, \nhas also hindered new lending. The National Chamber of \nEntrepreneurs (Atameken) estimates that only 20% of the \ncountry\u2019s 1.2 million or more entrepreneurs use credit.\n\nIn January 2019, the government acknowledged that the \nlack of an efficient bankruptcy procedure and lax supervision \nhave exacerbated difficulties among commercial banks. \nThe central bank and the government aim to streamline \nthe bankruptcy law, and the central bank to adopt a risk-\nbased approach to bank regulation. However, inadequate \ntransparency, accountability, and integrity remain fundamental \nproblems that need to be addressed. Resolving them \nwill require a comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory \nframework, not least to limit the influence of insiders and \nconnected interests, and a rethinking of loan subsidies. \nFurther,\u00a0constraints impeding the work of the Problem Loans \nFund should be addressed.\n\nIndependent portfolio reviews and bank stress tests are \nalso critical. In April 2018, a deputy central bank chairman \ndeclared that large discrepancies had been identified between \naudited statements and central bank assessments of bank \nassets for fiscal year 2017. Because the underreporting of NPLs \nundermines the credibility of official statistics and confidence \nin bank regulation, the central bank needs to strengthen \nmacroprudential policies to ensure that commercial banks \ncomply with rules and standards. In addition, it needs to take \nsteps to level the playing field for SME access to credit. \n\n\fKyrgyz Republic\n\nGrowth slowed in 2018 in tandem with smaller gains in mining and manufacturing. Inflation \ndecelerated  by  half,  and  the  current  account  deficit  widened  sharply.  Growth  is  projected \nto  recover  in  2019  and  continue  accelerating  in  2020  on  recovery  in  gold  production  and \nslower but continued growth in the region. Inflation will be higher and the current account \ndeficit  wider.  Reducing  risks  from  flooding  and  associated  disasters  has  become  urgent \nwith  climate  change.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth declined from 4.7% in 2017 to 3.5% in 2018 as slower \ngrowth in the large gold mining industry outweighed gains in \ntextiles and apparel. \n\nOn the supply side, growth in industry slowed from 8.6% \nin 2017 to 6.2% as expansion in mining plunged from 58.4% \nto 8.1% and that of manufacturing fell less dramatically from \n6.7% to 5.0% (Figure 3.5.1). Gold production in the first half \nof 2018 was 40% lower than in the same period a year earlier \nbecause of the poor quality of ore, but it recovered substantially \nin the second half of the year as ore quality improved. \nConstruction\u00a0expanded by 7.8%, decelerating marginally from \n7.9% in 2017 as slower growth in investment into mining, \nenergy generation, and transport offset acceleration elsewhere. \nGrowth in agriculture rose from 2.2% in 2017 to 2.7% on gains \nin horticulture and animal husbandry. Growth in services \nslowed from 3.3% in 2017 to 2.1% as expansion in retail and \nwholesale trade diminished from 7.1% to 5.1%. \n\nOn the demand side, growth found support from higher \npublic investment into energy and transport infrastructure \nprojects, and from higher public and private consumption, the \nlatter reflecting a 5.5% rise in remittances, with all remittances \nequal to a quarter of GDP (Figure 3.5.2).\n\nAverage annual inflation slowed from 3.2% in 2017 to 1.5% \n\nlast year as a good harvest and substantial imports of food \nfrom Uzbekistan cut food prices by 2.6%. Prices rose by 1.1% \nfor goods other than food and by 4.1% for services. Inflation \nin December 2018 year on year was only 0.5%, down sharply \nfrom 3.7% a year earlier (Figure 3.5.3).

Dollarization remained \nextensive, with the share of loans in foreign currency at the \nend of 2018 unchanged at 38.0% and the share of deposits at \n44.5%, down from 48.7% at the end of 2017.\n\nThe current account deficit is estimated to have widened \nby half from the equivalent of 6.5% of GDP in 2017 to 10.0%. \nTrade increased by 6.6%, with exports stagnant, as gains in \ncement, metals, cotton, and textiles could not offset lower gold \nshipments, and with imports rising by 9.2% on increases for \noil products, construction materials, textiles, and consumer \ngoods. Growth in remittances was estimated at 5.5%, down \nsharply from 24.3% in 2017. International reserves remained at \n$2.2\u00a0billion at the end of 2018, providing cover for 3.8 months \nof imports. External debt, including government-guaranteed \nand private debt, is estimated to have fallen from the equivalent \nof 92.4% of GDP at the end of 2017 to 83.9% at the end of the \nthird quarter of 2018 (Figure 3.5.5).

In view of the expected rise in inflation, \nmonetary policy will likely remain focused on maintaining \nprice stability. The central bank aims to establish a policy of \ninflation targeting over the medium term, using an inflation \ntarget of 5%\u20137%. \n\nGDP in 2019 on higher current and capital spending. As the \ngovernment aims to restrain expenditure on low-priority \nitems while improving tax policy and administration, the \nfiscal deficit is seen easing to 1.2% in 2020 (Figure 3.5.8). \nFiscal\u00a0consolidation remains a major concern, the goal being \nto rebuild fiscal space for later accommodation as needed \nand to ensure debt sustainability. Consolidation efforts will \nfocus on rationalizing expenditure by reforming public wages, \ncutting subsidies, and improving the targeting of social \nbenefits. The\u00a0government intends to raise revenue as well by \nbroadening the tax base and strengthening tax and customs \nadministration. The aim is to keep external public debt below \n50% at least to the end of 2020.\n\nThe current account deficit is expected to widen to 12.0% \n\nin both 2019 and 2020 (Figure 3.5.9).

The country\u2019s vulnerability to harm from climate \nchange is ranked at 68 of 181 countries in the Notre Dame \nGlobal Adaptation Index in 2017. Moreover, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic is located in a seismically active mountainous \nregion prone to earthquakes, floods, mudslides, avalanches, \nsnowstorms, and mountain lake spills. Disasters from natural \nhazards such as floods and earthquakes occur frequently \nand are estimated to cost the equivalent of 1.0%\u20131.5% of \nGDP annually. Water resources are particularly vulnerable, \nparticularly in the southwestern districts, where droughts, \nlandslides, flooding, and other water-related disasters are \nfrequent. Landslides comprise a quarter of all disasters and \ncause half of disaster-related fatalities. Risk is heightened \nby a lack of investment in preventive works, inadequate \nrisk management, and the limited amount of state and local \ngovernment resources available to address risks.\n\nEfforts to strengthen resilience under climate change \nand extreme weather events are guided by the government\u2019s \nnational development, climate change, and sector strategies. \nThe national development program for 2018\u20132022 includes \nproactive management of disaster and climate change risks and \nprioritizes building and rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure \nto achieve greater water-use efficiency. A comprehensive \nstrategy introduced in 2018 for protecting the land and its \npeople in emergencies to 2030 seeks to reduce disaster losses \nthrough, among other measures, improved monitoring and \nforecasting and the construction of protective structures. \nThe\u00a0strategy will require funding from 2018 to 2022 equal to \n1.8% of annual GDP. A state program to develop irrigation from \n2017 to 2026 seeks to use water resources more productively \nby constructing and modernizing infrastructure and by \nintroducing improved technology. It requires funding equal to \n10% of annual GDP.\n\nDevelopment partners support government efforts through \n\nprojects that emphasize modernizing irrigation systems and \nthat target optimized and resilient agricultural production, \nas\u00a0well\u00a0as improved water productivity.

Inflation slowed, but the current account slipped back into deficit as exports \nshrank  and  imports  grew.  Economic  expansion  is  projected  to  slow  in  2019  and  again \nin  2020  as  capital  spending  moderates.  Inflation  may  accelerate  under  more  exchange \nrate  flexibility,  but  rising  electricity  exports  should  narrow  the  current  account  deficit. \nDiversifying  exports  could  improve  incomes  and  economic  resilience. \n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth increased marginally from 7.1% in 2017 to 7.3% as \nlarge\u00a0public investment projects continued, remittances \nremained high, and relations improved with Uzbekistan, \nboosting bilateral trade. Improvement came despite weak \nprivate investment and persistent problems in banking. \n\nOn the supply side, growth in industry fell by almost half \nfrom 21.3% in 2017 to 11.8% as aluminum production plunged \nby 7.1% because of delays in importing ore and ongoing \nrenovation of production facilities\u2014and despite gains of 16.3% \nin mining, 12.5% in manufacturing, and 7.8% in electricity \ngeneration (Figure 3.6.1). Gold production rose by 16.9% to \na new record. Growth in agriculture slowed from 6.8% in \n2017 to 4.0% as drought cut cotton production by 22.3%. \nDespite\u00a0fruit and vegetable production higher by more than \n10%, agriculture\u2019s share in GDP slipped from 21.1% in 2017 \nto 18.7% (Figure 3.6.2). Growth in services accelerated from \n1.8% to 2.1% as an 11.0% rise in disposable income from higher \nremittances and government salaries boosted retail trade \nby\u00a09.8%. Expansion in construction, fueled by infrastructure \nand private building, rose from 4.1% in 2017 to 7.8%.\n\nOn the demand side, growth in investment accelerated \nfrom 4.1% in 2017 to 7.8% on higher public outlays. Despite \nimproved trade with Uzbekistan, net exports plunged by 40.2% \nas continued heavy infrastructure spending drove a 13.5% rise \nin imports, in particular of capital goods, and weak demand for \nminerals cut exports by 10.4% even as electricity exports rose. \n\nInflation decelerated from 6.7% in 2017 to 5.4% \n\n(Figure\u00a03.6.3).

The National Bank of Tajikistan, the central \nbank, continued moving toward an inflation target of 5%\u20139% \nby expanding sales of Treasury bills and central bank securities \nto slow monetary expansion even as it extended significant \ncredit to the government budget. Growth in broad money \ntumbled from 21.8% in 2017 to 5.1%, though private credit \nreversed a 1.3% decline in 2017 to rise by 6.5% (Figure 3.6.6). \nReserve\u00a0money growth slowed sharply from 21.0% to 7.0%. \nWith less inflation, the central bank cut the refinancing rate \nfrom 16.00% to 14.75% in January 2018 and further to 14.00% \nin March, but returned the rate to 14.75% in February 2019 \nto cool the economy. Tightened foreign exchange controls \nand other efforts to combat dollarization trimmed the share \nof foreign currency deposits from 60.3% at the end of 2017 to \n53.2% a year later, and of loans in foreign currency from 61.0% \nto 57.2%. \n\nHigher remittances and more careful screening of new \nborrowers helped cut the rate of nonperforming loans from \n36.5% of all lending at the end of 2017 to 31.1% a year later. \nThe\u00a0return on bank assets improved from 0.5% in 2017 to 1.9%, \nand on bank equity from 1.7% to 7.0% (Figure 3.6.7).

To reduce its \nvulnerability, Tajikistan needs to diversify its economy and in \nparticular its export base. \n\nWork on the Rogun hydropower project, the second \ngenerator of which is due to come online in April 2019, \nhas diversified the economy both directly and indirectly. \n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n3.6.10\u2002Remittances and GDP growth\n\nTajikistan GDP growth\nRussian Federation\nGDP growth\n\nPersonal remittances\nreceived\n\n% of GDP\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSources: World Bank.

However, more could be done to promote \ndiversification. \n\ninformation technology to provide better commercial support \nservices. This would require education and training to enhance \ncomputer skills in the population while making internet access \ncheaper and better. In December 2018, the Speedtest Global \nIndex ranked Tajikistan the worst in the world for mobile \ninternet speed and at 113 of 177 countries for the quality of its \nfixed broadband. Tajikistan could reap significant economic \ndividends by strengthening its information technology \ninfrastructure\u2014improving internet connections and \nencouraging private investment in data and voice services, both \ndomestic and international\u2014and by training a cohort of young \ndevelopers in programming and technology applications. \n\nSecond, Tajikistan should explore opportunities to export \n\nproducts for which it likely enjoys a comparative advantage, \nsuch as high-value agricultural products. With appropriate \nbranding and marketing, it could sell in nearby countries and \npotentially beyond. Yet agriculture remains largely subsistence, \naccording to a 2014 survey by the World Bank, with only \none-third of crop producers selling their output and more than \nhalf of this group doing so at the farm gate. Giving\u00a0farmers \ntechnical support in marketing, and establishing marketing \nassociations to attain economies of scale and reduce \ntransaction costs, could help boost production, sales, and \nultimately exports, which would raise rural incomes.\n\nThird, Tajikistan should address other shortcomings in its \n\ninvestment climate. In Doing Business 2019, the World Bank \nranked Tajikistan at 148 of 189 countries in cross-border trade, \na deficiency it could address by improving customs, transport, \nand logistics procedures and by upgrading its rail and road \nconnections with neighboring countries. Tajikistan similarly \nranks at 136 of 189 countries in tax policy and collection. \nIts\u00a0effective tax rate on company profit is, at 67.3%, more than \ndouble the 32.3% national average in Europe and Central\u00a0Asia. \nLower tax rates could be made feasible by reviewing tax policy \nto see whether some of the corporate tax burden could be \nshifted to other sources and by eliminating tax exemptions \nthat fail to promote investment and innovation while distorting \nmarkets. Simplifying procedures for starting a business could \npotentially expand the tax base. Finally, Tajikistan could \nexplore how to improve access to credit, another area where \nit ranks low, at 124 of 189 countries. Reducing the rate of \nnonperforming loans would help, as would creating more \nequitable access to loans for private firms.\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Tajikistan State Statistical Agency; ADB estimates.\n\n3.6.12\u2002Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\nSources: National Bank of Tajikistan; ADB estimates.\n\n\fTurkmenistan\n\nGrowth  reportedly  moderated  as  expansion  apart  from  hydrocarbons  slowed  with  fiscal \nconsolidation.  Inflation  accelerated,  and  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed.  Continued \nfiscal consolidation will slow growth further in 2019 and 2020. Inflation will likely ease but \nremain near double digits, and higher hydrocarbon export volumes will further narrow the \ncurrent account deficit. The government needs to evaluate and mitigate the social impact \nof  subsidy  reform. \n\nEconomic performance \nThe government reported GDP growth at 6.2% in 2018, down \nfrom 6.5% a year earlier (Figure 3.7.1). On the supply side, the \nhydrocarbon industry expanded by 6.0%, well up from 1.7% in \n2017. However, growth in the larger non-hydrocarbon economy \nslowed from 7.5% in 2017 to 6.2% last year. \n\nFrom preliminary estimates, industry growth accelerated \nfrom 5.4% in 2017 to 6.0%. Gains in hydrocarbons were partly \noffset by slower expansion in construction. Growth in services \nslowed from 7.9% to 6.8% with less expansion in construction \nand despite strong performances in trade, transport, and \ncommunications. Agriculture growth is estimated to have \nslowed from 5.9% in 2017 to 4.8% as adverse weather affected \nharvests of strategic crops, notably cotton and wheat. \n\nOn the demand side, investment continued to drive \n\ngrowth despite a cut in government capital spending. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated gross \ninvestment in\u00a02018 down from the equivalent of 41.0% of GDP \nin 2017 to\u00a037.0%, of which 3.4 percentage points was foreign \ndirect investment (FDI), mainly for gas, oil, and chemical \nprocessing (Figure\u00a03.7.2). Growth in consumption weakened, \nespecially private consumption, as inflation and a widening gap \nbetween the official and parallel market exchange rates eroded \nreal household incomes despite a nominal 10.0% rise in public \nsector salaries, pensions, and stipends in January 2018. \n\nNo official estimate is available for inflation in 2018, but in \n\nNovember 2018 the IMF estimated inflation at 9.4%, up from \n8.0% in 2017 (Figure 3.7.3).

To stem even larger increases, the government \ninstituted price controls for selected foods and services. \n\nMonetary policy focused on containing inflation as the \nCentral Bank of Turkmenistan kept strict control of cash in \ncirculation, promoted noncash payments instead, and imposed \nrestrictions on foreign exchange transactions. Although credit \ngrowth slowed from 17.0% in 2017 to 12.0%, lending remained \nsizable at the equivalent of 60% of GDP, mostly subsidized \ncredit to state-owned enterprises in priority sectors to facilitate \nimport substitution and promote exports (Figure 3.7.4). \n\nThe state budget deficit is estimated to have narrowed \nfrom the equivalent of 2.8% of GDP in 2017 to 0.9%, reflecting \nfiscal consolidation that reduced capital spending and cut \nsubsidies under major subsidy reform (Figure 3.7.5). Revenue \nwas estimated at 14.4% of GDP, down from 14.9% last year, \nwith expenditure falling from 17.7% of GDP in 2017 to 15.3%. \nBudget financing came mainly from central bank purchases \nof Treasury securities. The government reported that over \n70% of outlays were for social spending and a 10.0% rise in \nsalaries, pensions, and stipends. The non-hydrocarbon fiscal \ndeficit narrowed from 7.7% of GDP in 2017 to 5.5%. Extra-\nbudgetary operations remained large, however, and should \nbe incorporated into the budget to improve transparency and \naccountability in public finance. Public debt incurred by both \nthe government and state enterprises was estimated to equal \n30.9% of GDP at the end of 2018, up from 28.8% a year earlier.\n\nExport revenue rose in 2018 on recovery in global \nhydrocarbon prices and increased demand for gas from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. This and import restrictions \nnarrowed the current account deficit from 11.5% of GDP in \n2017 to an estimated 8.2%. Estimated growth in exports soared \nfrom 6.3% in 2017 to 26.0%, while imports expanded by 9.3% \nfollowing an 18.0% drop in 2017. FDI inflows in 2018 were \nestimated at $1.5 billion, most of them for oil, gas, and chemical \nproduction. Besides FDI, external borrowing remained \nsignificant, risking debt accumulation and the eventual need to \ndraw down the central bank\u2019s international reserves, a concern \nin a period of rising loan repayments and low global energy \nprices.

Banks will \ncontinue to direct their lending to state-owned enterprises in \npriority\u00a0sectors.\n\nThe state budget envisages further cuts to capital spending, \n\ncontinued subsidy reform, and improved tax administration \nto better mobilize revenues. The government plans to develop \na medium-term fiscal framework with technical assistance \nfrom the IMF, which should include a path for annual \nreductions in public investment. The state budget is projected \nto incur deficits equal to 1.3% of GDP in 2019 and 0.9% in \n2020 (Figure\u00a03.7.6). The government aims to continue support \nfor social services, with over 70% of budget expenditure \ngoing for such outlays plus wages, pensions, and stipends. \nTreasury\u00a0bonds in local currency are expected to provide \nbudget financing equal to 4.2% of GDP and allow some existing \ndomestic debt to be refinanced.\n\nContracts for larger gas shipments are forecast to lift \nmerchandise exports by 14.0% in 2019 and 10.0% in 2020, \noutpacing projected merchandise import growth of 6.2% in \n2019 and 0.5% in 2020. With the completion of large projects \nthat require imports of advanced equipment and services, the \ncurrent account deficit is expected to narrow to 5.7% of GDP in \n2019 and 3.4% in 2020 (Figure 3.7.7). As financing other large \ninvestments would require further accumulation of external \ndebt, which is already projected to equal 29.4% of GDP in \n2019 and 31.0% at the end of 2020, a sound debt-management \nstrategy is required, especially given low hydrocarbon prices \nand a sizable external deficit (Figure 3.7.8). \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014assessing and mitigating \nthe social impact of subsidy reform\nIn response to the adverse impact of lower global hydrocarbon \nprices on budget revenue, the government has taken significant \nmeasures to rationalize public spending. Besides trimming \ncapital spending, it has initiated comprehensive subsidy reform. \nSince 1991, generous subsidies have been a key element of \nTurkmenistan\u2019s effort to distribute to citizens benefits from \nthe country\u2019s resource wealth and ensure the well-being of \nlow-income households.

In addition, large subsidies were \ngiven for 17 other types of products: certain foods, medicines, \npublic transportation, housing, telephone, kindergarten, \nand other services. The IMF reports that Turkmenistan \nhas maintained some of the largest energy subsidies in the \nCommonwealth of Independent States. \n\nThe government began to reform subsidies in 2014, \n\nliberalizing prices to various degrees on regulated goods and \nservices. In January 2019, it ended free electricity, gas, and \nwater allotments for households. As the government aims to \nachieve cost recovery in its provision of services, further cuts \nin subsidies are envisaged, with consequent price increases for \nmany products and services. These and future price increases \nwill have important social consequences that need to be \nproperly assessed and addressed.\n\nrising inflation and further cutbacks in social subsidies have \neroded living standards and households\u2019 real purchasing power. \nAs income disparities are large, low-income households may \nhave been affected substantially (Figure 3.7.9). \n\nA comprehensive review of existing social protection \nprograms is needed to inform efforts for their improvement, \ntaking into account households\u2019 real income, purchasing power, \nand rates of unemployment and poverty. Improving data bases \nand strengthening the capacity of state institutions to conduct \nperiodic assessments using best international practices can help \nmaintain adequate social safety nets, to cushion the negative \neffects of subsidy cuts and rising inflation on income and living \nstandards. In tandem with such programs, macroeconomic \npolicies should aim to sustain growth, control inflation, and \ncreate more productive jobs. A gradual and phased-in approach \nto subsidy cuts and price liberalization would provide time to \nstrengthen social safety nets.\n\nApart from enhancing social protection, Turkmenistan \ncould do more to improve other aspects of social development. \nDespite high subsidies and social spending, many health and \neducation indicators lag those of economies with high human \ndevelopment, according to the latest United Nations\u2019 human \ndevelopment report. Thus, savings from subsidy reform should \nbe used to improve the quality of health care and education \nservices, and targeted support for low-income households. \n\nSubsidy reform can be more successful when it is part of \na larger agenda encompassing institutional reform to improve \npublic finances and economic efficiency while maintaining \nadequate living standards. The government thus needs to \nensure that measures to preserve living standards are an \nintegral part of its subsidy reform program.\n\n\fUzbekistan\n\nGrowth reportedly accelerated in 2018, inflation jumped, and the current account slipped \nfrom  surplus  into  a  deep  deficit.  Growth  is  projected  higher  in  2019  and  2020  on \nexpansion  in  industry  and  services.  Tighter  monetary  policy  is  expected  to  slow  inflation \nin  2019  and  2020  despite  upward  adjustments  to  utility  tariffs.  The  current  account \ndeficit  will  persist  but  shrink  slightly  in  2020.  Irrigation  reform  is  essential  to  agricultural \nsustainability  and  climate  proofing. \n\nEconomic performance\nThe government reported that growth accelerated from \n4.5% in 2017 to 5.1% in 2018 on faster expansion in industry, \nconstruction, and investment. The figure for 2017 has been \nrevised down as the government revisited GDP data, including \ngrowth rates, dating back to 2010. \n\nOn the supply side, growth in industry excluding \n\nconstruction doubled from 5.2% in 2017 to 10.6%, driven by \nincreases of 6.4% in manufacturing and 28.2% in mining and \nquarrying (Figure 3.8.1). Construction expanded by 9.9%, \nup from 6.0% in 2017, with gains in housing and production \nfacilities. Growth in services slowed from 6.4% to 5.4% \nlast year, with smaller increases in transport and trade. \nExpansion\u00a0in agriculture dropped from 1.2% in 2017 to 0.2% as \npoor rainfall cut cereal harvests by 12.5% and crop production \nmore broadly by 4.7%. \n\nInvestment was the main driver of growth on the demand \n\nside. Expansion in gross fixed capital formation jumped \nfrom 7.1% in 2017 to 18.1% largely on higher investment in \nmanufacturing, housing, energy, and mining fueled by a 36.6% \nsurge in foreign investment and lending for fixed capital. \nIn\u00a0real terms, public consumption rose by an estimated 4.0%, \nas did private consumption by 3.0% on nominal wage increases \nthat averaged 25.0% (6.4% in real terms) and nominal pension \nincreases that averaged 22.6%.\n\nAverage inflation accelerated from 13.7% in 2017 to \n17.9%, reflecting the continuing impact of foreign exchange \nliberalization in the last quarter of 2017 and the first half \nof 2018 (Figure 3.8.2). Adding to inflation were utility price \nincreases, price liberalization for bread and other basic \ngoods, higher wages and pensions, and rapid credit growth, \nall\u00a0occurring in 2018.

The assets of banks with \nstate ownership expanded by 32.0%, and their lending by\u00a052.2%.\nThe Uzbek sum depreciated by 2.5% against the US\u00a0dollar \n\nin 2018 despite the central bank selling $3.8\u00a0billion in \nUS\u00a0dollars during the year. Demand for foreign exchange \nreached $10.4 billion, mainly for imports to supply \nmanufacturing and construction.\n\nThe current account balance recorded a deficit equal to \n7.0% of GDP, reversing a surplus of 2.9% in 2017 (Figure 3.8.4). \nExports of goods and services grew by 13.6%, with exports \nof services rising by 22.4% and of hydrocarbons by 65.8%. \nImports\u00a0of goods and services jumped by 39.6%, reflecting \na 64.6% increase in imports of machinery and equipment to \nmodernize industry and infrastructure. The resulting trade \ndeficit was $5.3 billion. Remittances in the first 9 months \nof 2018 were $3.8 billion, 80% of which came from the \nRussian\u00a0Federation.\n\nLower foreign investment into hydrocarbons cut foreign \ndirect investment by 14.2% in 2018. Foreign reserves slipped \nfrom $28.1 billion at the end of 2017 to $27.1 billion a year later, \nstill providing cover for 17 months of imports (Figure\u00a03.8.5). \nHigher foreign borrowing hiked external debt from 26.5% of \nGDP in 2017 to 34.7%. This prompted the Ministry of Finance to \nstrengthen its management of external debt.

The main risk \nto macroeconomic stability stems from persistent credit \nexpansion, which could revive inflationary pressure and push \nthe current account further into deficit. \n\nOn the supply side, growth in industry is expected to slow \nto 5.5% in 2019, reflecting slower expansion in the production \nof machinery and petrochemicals for agriculture, and in \nmining and quarrying primarily for export and construction. \nIndustrial sector growth is forecast to recover to 6.0% in \n2020. Construction is forecast to expand by 9.0% each year, \nsustained by government expansion of urban infrastructure \nand services. Periodic increases in wages and pensions, and of \nspending for social assistance, are projected to expand services \nby 5.5% each year by boosting trade and transport. Growth \nin agriculture is forecast to accelerate to 4.0% in 2019, thanks \nto ample rain and structural reform in cotton and wheat, and \n4.5% in\u00a02020. Ongoing farm and agro-processing reform should \nboost\u00a0exports. \n\nOn the demand side, growth will come mainly from \ninvestment as gross fixed capital formation rises on further \nimprovement in the investment climate and government-led \ninvestment to modernize manufacturing, mining, power \ngeneration, transportation, and housing. Private consumption \nis expected to benefit from wage growth. Net exports are \nanticipated to remain a drag on growth in 2019 and 2020.\n\nInflation is projected to decelerate to 16.0% in 2019 and \n\nfurther to 14.0% in 2020 as lending growth under state \nprograms slows and as further streamlining of customs \nprocedures facilitates imports (Figure 3.8.7). Inflationary \npressure will persist, however, from the lagged effects of \na November 2018 rise in energy prices, further hikes to \nelectric power and natural gas prices planned for June 2019, \nconsequent adjustments to wages and pensions, and upward \nrevisions to customs duties on imports. The central bank \nwill pursue a phased transition to inflation targeting, aiming \nto reduce it to single digits by 2021. To contain inflationary \npressure, monetary and fiscal authorities must coordinate \ntheir actions to mitigate the impact of liberalized prices for \nagricultural products and of protracted growth in credit.\n\nGrowth in broad money is forecast to slow to 13.0% in 2019 \n\nand 12.0% in 2020 as growth in credit falls by half to 25.0% \nand then drops to 15.0% (Figure 3.8.8). In 2019, the central \nbank will limit preferential lending under state programs and \nfurther modify capital requirements for commercial banks \nwhen extending credit.

It envisions developing money market \ninstruments such as short-term deposits, swaps, and repo \nauctions\u2014and issuing bonds that pay in 1, 3, 6, and 12 months\u2014\nto manage liquidity in 2019 and 2020 while expanding its \nsterilization of foreign exchange inflows to keep monetary \npolicy tight.\n\nThe consolidated fiscal balance is forecast to remain at \nthe equivalent of 0.5% of GDP in 2019 and 2020 (Figure 3.8.9). \nThe\u00a0augmented fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 2.0% \nof GDP in 2019 and 2020, reflecting the planned reduction in \npolicy-guided lending, in particular on-lending by Uzbekistan \nFund for Reconstruction and Development, to curb inflationary \npressure from credit growth. As a part of tax reform, the \ngovernment adopted in January 2019 a flat 12.0% individual \nincome tax, introduced value-added tax on companies with \nrevenue above SUM1 billion, and reduced the corporate income \ntax rate from 14.0% to 12.0%. Revenue in the consolidated \nbudget is forecast to reach the equivalent of 30.0% of GDP \nin 2019 and 2020 as expenditure, mainly capital spending on \ninfrastructure, remains at 29.5%. The restructuring of state-\nowned enterprises, the major contributors to the state budget, \nwill create challenges for revenue, which the government plans \nto address through tax reform that brings more private firms \ninto the tax base. \n\nThe current account deficit is expected to remain high at \n7.0% of GDP in 2019 before narrowing slightly to 6.5% in 2020 \n(Figure 3.8.10). Exports of goods are forecast to grow by 10.0% \nin 2019 and 12.0% in 2020, reflecting expectations of higher \ngold prices, stable demand for natural gas from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, expanded agricultural exports to the \nRussian Federation and other neighbors including Kazakhstan, \nand further processing of cotton fiber into textiles. Imports\u00a0of \ngoods are projected to rise by 25.0% in 2019 and 20.0% in \n2020 as demand generated by infrastructure projects and the \ncontinued modernization of industry boost imports for these \nsectors. The risk of wider current account deficits persists as \ncredit growth may further encourage imports of capital goods. \nExternal borrowing for state-led development programs is \n\nprojected to push external debt to the equivalent of 35.0% of \nGDP in 2019 and 2020 (Figure 3.8.11).

It provides 27.3% of all jobs and \ncontributes nearly one-third of GDP. Rapid population growth \naveraging 1.9% per year from 2005 to 2019 has put stress on the \ncountry\u2019s limited environmental resources, exacerbating land \ndegradation and water shortages that constrain agricultural \noutput.\n\nA study by the International Food Policy Research \n\nInstitute and the Center for Development Research estimated \nthat over half of cropland suffers soil salinization caused \nby extensive irrigation, and that the resulting ecosystem \nchanges and suppressed agricultural output cost Uzbekistan \nabout 4% of GDP annually. In this arid climate, drought \nand water shortages are a constant threat. Precipitation \nin most areas averages less than 600 millimeters per year, \nand high temperatures can reach 49\u00b0 Celsius in some areas, \nrequiring river-fed irrigation. According to the Ministry of \nWater Resources, available water resources declined from \n64\u00a0billion cubic meters (m3) in 1991 to 59 billion m3 in 2018, and \npopulation growth almost halved per capita availability from \n3,048 m3 to 1,589 m3. In 2018, agriculture received nearly 90% \nof the water supply.\n\nTo address salinization and diminished water resources, \n\nthe government is rehabilitating the irrigation system with \ninvestments worth $350 million last year and this year. It is \nproviding incentives to adopt more water-efficient technologies. \nSuppliers of imported drip and sprinkler irrigation systems are \nexempted from customs duties for 5 years, and farmers that \nadopt them are similarly exempted from land tax. At the end \nof 2018, farmers were applying water-efficient technologies on \nmore than 328,000 hectares. Drip irrigation currently supplies \nonly 43,000 hectares, though, because of the high cost of \nintroducing it. To encourage adoption, the government decided \nthis year to award drip-adopting cotton farmers a one-time \npayment of $950 per hectare.\n\nDespite their benefits, measures implemented in an ad hoc \nfashion allocate resources inefficiently. Over the next 2 years, \nthe government should accelerate the creation of long-term \nstrategies for agriculture and water resource management \nand develop an even broader plan for mitigating and adapting \nto climate change. These strategies should prioritize farmers\u2019 \naccess to extension services and finance for machinery, and \nstrengthen the security of their land tenure, to promote \nmore efficient use of land and water resources. In addition, \nas water resource management cannot be undertaken on a \nnational scale in isolation from the broader regional context, \nUzbekistan should promote water resource management and \nclimate proofing across borders through collaboration with its \nneighbors.\n\n\fEAST ASIA\n\nHONG KONG, CHINA\u2002\u2022\n\nMONGOLIA\u2002\u2022\n\nPEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\u2002\u2022\n\nREPUBLIC OF KOREA\u2002\u2022\n\nTAIPEI,CHINA\u2002\u2022\n\n\f\fHong Kong, China\n\nGrowth  slowed  in  2018  as  the  external  environment  became  more  challenging.

Innovative  policies  are  needed  to  raise  the  rate  of  labor \nforce  participation  among  women  and  older  workers,  toward  alleviating  the  economic \nchallenges  posed  by  a  rapidly  aging  population.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth moderated to 3.0% in 2018 from 3.8% in 2017 \nas downward pressure came from sluggish global trade, \ntightening external financial conditions, and persistent global \ntrade friction (Figure 3.9.1). Domestic demand nevertheless \nremained resilient and served as the source of growth in\u00a02018. \nSpurred by favorable job and income conditions, private \nconsumption expenditure expanded by 5.6% in real terms and \ncontributed 3.8 percentage points to GDP growth. Government \nspending also expanded, by 4.2%, adding 0.4 points to growth. \nMachinery and equipment acquisition picked up significantly, \nbut building and construction saw a marginal decline, dragging \ndown the investment contribution to growth to 0.3 points. \nBoth export and import growth edged down, with net exports \nshaving 1.5 points off growth (Figure 3.9.2). \n\nOn the supply side, services remained the primary \ndriver of economic growth, expanding by 3.4% last year. \nManufacturing grew by 1.3%, while construction deteriorated \nby 0.2%.

Average residential property prices retreated from their \npeak in July but still rose by 1.8% in 2018, while newly let \nresidential rents increased by 3.3%.\n\nThe current account surplus narrowed from the equivalent \n\nof 4.7% of GDP in 2017 to 4.3% in 2018. This reflected a \nhigher goods trade deficit, albeit partly offset by rising net \ninflows of primary income and a higher surplus in services \ntrade. Meanwhile, the overall balance of payments surplus \nnarrowed sharply from 9.4% of GDP in 2017 to 0.3% in 2018 as \nnet capital flows turned negative.

Growth moderation in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) and several other key partners will weigh on \nexports from Hong Kong, China, such that net exports will \nadd little to growth this year and next. Consumption will \nremain the engine of growth, supported by continued stable \nemployment and strong incomes, though recent economic \ndevelopments both at home and abroad have dampened \nconfidence in the economy, reflected in softer asset prices \nand declines in retail sales. Private investment could weaken \nfurther this year, after a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of \n2018, on deteriorating local business sentiment. The composite \npurchasing managers\u2019 index inched up slightly in January but \nremains in contraction territory. Business surveys saw sharp \ndeterioration in sentiment, particularly in import/export \ntrade and wholesale, reflecting the impact of ongoing trade \nconflict, and in real estate, mirroring the recent cooling in the \nproperty\u00a0market.\n\nOn the supply side, services will continue to be the main \ndriver of growth, supported by trade-related and professional \nservices. Business sentiment in the sector fell markedly in \nmid-January, but retail, accommodation, and food services will \nlikely be buttressed by continued strength in inbound tourism.\nInflation is forecast to decelerate slightly to 2.3% in 2019 \nand 2020 (Figure 3.9.8). The rising trend in rents starting early \nlast year will continue to feed through, but recent consolidation \nin property markets will have a mitigating effect on consumer \nprices. Cost increases will be restrained as well by slower \neconomic growth, higher interest rates at home, and the strong \nUS dollar, while soft international commodity prices will keep \nexternal price pressures at bay.\n\nThe FY2019 budget surplus is forecast to dip to the \n\nequivalent of 0.6% of GDP. Budgetary revenue is slated to rise \nby 5.0% on higher expected receipts from land premiums. \nBudgetary expenditure is also projected to increase, \nby\u00a013.0%, on higher outlays for social welfare, education, \nhealth care, family allowances, tourism, and infrastructure, \nas\u00a0well as increased investment in land resource utilization, \nenvironmental protection, and promoting innovative and \ncreative industries.

Further, several trade and investment agreements, \nincluding those signed with the PRC and other key trade \npartners, may come into force this year. On balance, the \ncurrent account surplus is forecast to narrow to 3.5% of GDP \nthis year and further to 3.3% in 2020 (Figure 3.9.9).\n\nThe main risk to the outlook would be spillover from \n\nworsening trade friction. Full-blown escalation of the US\u2013PRC \ntrade conflict seems to mean the imposition by both economies \nof 25% blanket tariffs on all merchandise imports and, between \nthe US and its trade partners globally, additional 25% tariffs on \ntrade in automobiles and their parts and components. If this \nworse-case scenario occurs\u2014and if Hong Kong, China sees half \nof its trade affected by the conflict\u2014export growth is likely to \nfall by 0.2 percentage points, and GDP growth could lose an \nestimated 0.1 percentage points. Further, domestic demand, \nwhile still solid, may eventually succumb to heightened external \nuncertainties and weaker asset markets this year and next.\n\nin US interest rates, which could push up local interest rates. \nTighter local monetary conditions would deepen the fall \nin residential property prices, which is already a downside \ndomestic risk, and add to the debt burden, thus further \nweakening domestic demand. Nevertheless, Hong Kong, China \nremains well positioned to withstand external headwinds \nand counter these risks, buffered by ample fiscal reserves and \nbenefiting from prudent economic management and a sound \nfinancial system.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014sustaining labor supply \nas the population ages\nHong Kong, China has a population that is aging more rapidly \nthan in many other developed economies, including Japan, as \nfertility remains low and life expectancy rises. The Census \nand Statistics Department projects the share of the elderly in \nthe population to nearly double from 17.9% in 2018 to 31.9% \nin 2038, while the shares of those aged 18\u201364 and under 18 \nboth decrease (Figure 3.9.10). According to the International \nMonetary Fund, the rapidly increasing old age dependency \nratio\u2014defined as the ratio of residents drawing retirement \nbenefits to working-age residents\u2014can double public health \nspending, from the equivalent of 2.9% of GDP in 2016 to 6.0% \nin 2050, and spending on pensions, from 1.8% of GDP in 2015 to \n3.9% in 2050. These projections indicate that population aging \nthreatens to lower potential GDP growth by 0.75 percentage \npoints annually, on average, during 2020\u20132050, putting further \npressure on revenue and the fiscal balance.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nHong Kong, China\u2002\u2002189\n\n3.9.10\u2002Population share by age group\n\nBelow 18\n18\u201364\n65 and above\n\n%\n\n75\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n2018\nActual\n\n2028\n\n2038\n\n2058\n\n2066\n\n2048\nProjected\n\nSources: Demographic Statistics Section, Census and \nStatistics Department; Wong, K. and M.

The other main policy instruments available to the \nauthorities for this purpose are to raise the rate of labor \nforce participation and support innovation that keeps the \nelderly healthy and productive. There is certainly scope for \nraising female participation in the labor force, which, at 65% \nfor ages 15\u201364 in 2017, was about 15 percentage points lower \nthan for males. This gap can be narrowed through a range \nof actions: increased support for child care, more affordable \nchild and after-school care, and the promotion of flexible work \narrangements and part-time employment. The government has \nalready embarked on policies that aim to retain older workers \nand thereby slow labor force depletion. As part of this policy, \nthe Labor Department expanded its employment program for \nthe middle aged by providing subsidies to employers that hire \nthe unemployed or retirees aged above 60. In addition, the \nauthorities are studying interventions successfully undertaken \nin Japan and Singapore: employer subsidies, support for \ncreating short-term and flexible jobs, and statutory protection \nagainst age discrimination. \n\nThe government should also consider adaptive technologies \n\nthat help counter the downside effects of an aging workforce. \nSuch technologies allow people to work from home, help make \nthe workplace more ergonomically correct and supportive, and \nfacilitate medical advances that contribute to longevity and \nworking lives that are longer and more productive. Yet\u00a0other \nchannels\u2014through which technology can help seniors adapt \nand build their job skills, allowing them to be retained or \nbrought back into the workforce\u2014are advances in cloud-based \njob matching services and customized interactive training \nservices, such as remote and virtual education and training \nfor the elderly. Training programs should be developed for \nbusinesses to improve their management of age diversity and \nhuman resources. \n\nThe government should actively embrace labor market \ntechnological innovations more broadly and support them \nby funding research and development. The aim should \nbe to develop human capital and resources with better \nskills, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics, especially in industries attuned to the current \ndemographic shifts. With the work dependency ratio in steep \nascent, now is the time to act decisively to accommodate these \ndemographic changes and mitigate their negative impacts on \nthe economy. \n\n\fMongolia\n\nEconomic  recovery  continued  in  2018,  buoyed  by  mining  investment  and  higher  output \nin  services  and  industry.  Growth  should  extend  into  2019  and  2020,  albeit  at  a  declining \nrate,  on  strong  domestic  demand.  Inflation  will  accelerate  in  2019  before  slowing  again  in \n2020,  and  the  current  account  deficit  will  narrow  in  2019  before  widening  in  2020.  The \nuse  of  natural  resource  revenue  can  be  enhanced,  and  sustainable  development  assured, \nthrough  better  financial  management.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth quickened from 5.3% in 2017 to 6.9% in 2018 \non expansion in manufacturing and services and strong \ninvestment in mining (Figure 3.10.1). Benefiting from a 55.8% \nrise in credit and rising demand for transport services to \ncarry mineral exports, services contributed 3.2 percentage \npoints to growth. Industry added 2.8 points, boosted by 15.7% \ngrowth in manufacturing and despite a slump in residential \nconstruction. Growth recovered in mining on stronger gold and \ncoal production but remained moderate. Agriculture recovered \nfrom drought in 2017 to add 0.9 percentage points to growth as \ncrop harvests improved sharply and livestock production rose \nmoderately. \n\nOn the demand side, investment\u2014buoyed by a 29.2% \nincrease in foreign direct investment (FDI), mainly into \nmining\u2014increased by 27.2%, contributing 10.0 percentage \npoints to growth (Figure 3.10.2). Consumption contributed \na more modest 2.3 points, almost entirely derived from an \nincrease in private consumption driven by rising credit. \nExports rose by 15.3% as coal shipments grew despite logistical \nbottlenecks at the border with the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC). However, as imports rose by 21.4%, driven by increased \nFDI-financed mining inputs and a surge in car imports to beat \nanticipated credit tightening in 2019, net exports subtracted \n5.4\u00a0points from growth.\n\nAverage consumer price inflation rose from 4.3% in 2017 to \n6.8%, driven mostly by tight supply (Figure 3.10.3). Food prices \nincreased because drought affected crop production in 2017, \nand meat exports increased substantially despite lower meat \nproduction. Prices for heating coal rose sharply in anticipation \nof a ban on the sale of raw coal in May 2019, and a higher excise \ntax pushed up prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco.\n\nThis chapter was written by Declan Magee of the Mongolia Resident Mission, \nADB, Ulaanbaatar.\n\n3.10.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nServices\nMining\nIndustry other than mining\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.9\n\n5.3\n\n6.9\n\n2.4\n\n1.2\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: National Statistics Office of Mongolia. 2019. \nMonthly Statistical Bulletin.

Public debt \nincluding the foreign liabilities of the Bank of Mongolia, the \ncentral bank, fell from the equivalent of 99.2% of GDP in 2017 \nto 86.2% as fiscal policy tightened and included a freeze on the \nissuance of government domestic bonds (Figure\u00a03.10.5). \n\nBroad money surged by 22.8% in 2018 as credit to households \n\ngrew by 52.6% in anticipation of tighter credit controls in 2019 \nand as interest rates on loans continued to slide along with a \n1.0\u00a0percentage point cut in the central bank base rate in early \n2018, which followed a 2.0-point cut in 2017. In response to \nmounting pressure on the Mongolian togrog, the central bank \nhiked its base rate by 1.0 point in November\u00a02018. Concerns about \nrising household indebtedness further prompted the central bank \nto impose restrictions on the granting of bank loans, effective \nin 2019. The nonperforming loan ratio jumped from 8.5% of all \nloans in December 2017 to 10.4% a year later, bringing the capital \nshortfall in the banking sector to 3.1% of GDP (Figure 3.10.6).\n\nThe current account deficit widened to 14.6% of GDP in\u00a02018 \nas deficits in services and net income\u2014reflecting higher transport \nand insurance costs for imports and dividend payments to \nforeign investors\u2014outweighed the merchandise trade surplus \n(Figure\u00a03.10.7). Gross reserves rose by $500\u00a0million in 2018 to \nequal 5 months of imports, boosted by international bond issues \nand FDI inflows. The togrog depreciated against the US dollar by \n1.1% on average in 2018 and by 8.9% in the year to the end of 2018.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast to slow to 6.7% in 2019 and 6.3% \nin\u00a02020 (Figure 3.10.8). Domestic demand fueled by a more \naccommodative fiscal policy will support growth in 2019. \nAfter\u00a02\u00a0years of fiscal consolidation, government spending will \nincrease by 19.0% under the 2019 budget. FDI into mining will \nremain important, but will not increase as much as last year, \nmaking its contribution to growth statistically less pronounced. \nNet exports will continue to drag on growth but at a declining \nrate as export growth outpaces import growth. Coal exports \nwill benefit from a gradual switch in the PRC away from \nmore expensive processed coal from Australia, while high \ngold\u00a0inventories in Mongolia are expected to encourage higher \nexports in 2019.\n\nOn the supply side, services will be key to growth, with \ntransport expected to gain from growth in mining exports. \nManufacturing will also benefit from mining growth and from \n\nMonthly average\nexchange rate\n\nMNT/$\n\n2,800\n\n2,400\n\n2,000\n\n1,600\n\nCore in\ufb02ation\nIn\ufb02ation\nFood\nOther goods\n\n% change year on year\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: Bank of Mongolia. http://www.mongolbank.mn.\n\n3.10.4\u2002Fiscal balance\n\nBudget \nPrimary \n\n% of GDP\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-12\n\n-18\n\n% of GDP\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance. http://www.mof.gov.mn.\n\n3.10.5\u2002Public debt\n\nDomestic debt\nExternal debt\n\nInterest payments\n\n% of GDP\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Includes Bank of Mongolia foreign liabilities.\nSources: Ministry of Finance. http://www.mof.gov.mn; \nBank of Mongolia. http://www.mongolbank.mn.\n\n\f192(cid:7)(cid:7)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nexpanded processing of meat for export.

These effects \nwill be less pronounced in 2020 as public expenditure eases and \nthe pass-through of depreciation wanes, allowing inflation to \nstabilize at 7.5%.\n\nThe 2019 budget is expected to record a primary surplus equal \n\nto 1.0% of GDP and an overall deficit at 1.4% of GDP because of a \nlarge increase in government capital and election-related spending. \nRevenue growth, which was high in 2017 and 2018, is expected \nto moderate but could benefit from any of the upside risks to the \ngrowth outlook. The budget deficit is likely to shrink in 2020 as \nexpenditure subsides in the aftermath of the elections.\n\nThe current account deficit will narrow to equal 9.6% of \nGDP in 2019 as exports grow, in particular on anticipated large \nincreases in gold shipments, and as car imports slow under tighter \ncredit. The deficit in services will remain elevated in both years. \nThe current account deficit will widen again to 13.0% of GDP in \n2020 as export growth slows and import demand remains steady.\n\nMongolia is vulnerable to exogenous shocks owing to a \ndepleted Fiscal Stability Fund and low official international \nreserves. Slower growth in the PRC caused by trade tensions \nwith the US could squeeze Mongolia\u2019s mineral exports with \nlower prices and perhaps reduced volume. Further, continuing \nlogistical challenges at the PRC border may slow mineral exports. \nDomestically, the 2020 parliamentary elections could apply \npolitical pressure to loosen fiscal and monetary policies, which \nwould weigh on the exchange rate and put the country\u2019s scant \nreserves at risk, though a program agreed with the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) would act as a counterbalance. \nDespite\u00a0progress in bank recapitalization, continuing bank \nfragility poses a risk to economic health.

The Human Development Fund \nwas used for universal social transfers and accumulated large \ndebts. The Law on Government Special Funds was amended in \n2016 and 2017 to allow withdrawals from the Fiscal\u00a0Stability \nFund to cover the budget deficit until 2023. The Fiscal Stability \nLaw, enacted in 2010 to smooth fiscal expenditure and create \nprecautionary savings, has been undermined by 12\u00a0amendments \nto allow larger deficits as off-budget and quasi-fiscal spending \nrose substantially. Further, fiscal expenditure has been \npro-cyclical, fluctuating in line with coal and copper prices, \nrunning up public debt and proliferating public investment \nprojects that are not always viable (Figure\u00a03.10.10).\n\nUnder the program with the IMF, public finances have \nstabilized and growth has recovered. However, the recovery is \nfragile, debt-servicing costs are still high, and Mongolia remains \nvulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices. The\u00a0government \nshould respond to these challenges and set the stage for more \neffective use of mineral resources, not by creating new funds, \nbut by strengthening public financial management more \nbroadly. This will become even more crucial as major mining \ninvestments advance toward their production stage, mineral \nrevenues consequently rise, and debt service payments moderate \nwith the implementation of the IMF stabilization program.\n\nCrucial steps toward better public financial management \n\ninclude bringing all spending on budget and creating a \nstronger fiscal base that reduces dependence on commodity \nprices by, for\u00a0example, amending excise and income taxes. \nThe government should implement the recommendations of \na 2015 World Bank report on public financial management \nperformance, notably requiring all government entities \nto follow budgetary procurement procedures. It should \nalso ensure the effective functioning and independence \nof the new Fiscal\u00a0Stability Council, which is tasked with \nensuring compliance with the Fiscal Stability Law and fiscal \nsustainability rules, by providing security of tenure to its \nmembers, sufficient staff and financing, and the political \nindependence of its members. To enhance accountability, \nrevenue projections should be strengthened and budgetary \ninformation better disseminated to the public.

Growth  will  moderate  further  in  2019  and \n2020  as  global  growth  slows.  Inflation  will  remain  benign  as  the  current  account  edges \ninto  deficit.  Social  security  reform  can  help  rebalance  the  economy  toward  consumption. \n\nEconomic performance\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) saw growth slow from \n6.8% in 2017 to 6.6% in 2018, in line with the government\u2019s \ngrowth target of around 6.5% (Figure 3.11.1). On the demand \nside, consumption confirmed its role as the main driver of \ngrowth by contributing 5.0 percentage points, up from 3.9 \npoints in 2017 (Figure 3.11.2). Consumption found support in a \nrapid increase in government social spending, a cut in personal \nincome tax, and solid growth in household disposable income, \nthough it softened somewhat in the fourth quarter (Q4). \nReal\u00a0growth in household consumption expenditure accelerated \nfrom 5.4% in 2017 to 6.2% in 2018. However, while spending \non services such as tourism and information technology kept \nincreasing rapidly, real growth in retail sales of consumer goods \ndecelerated from 8.5% in 2017 to 6.9% in 2018, owing mostly to a \nslump in car sales, but edged up in early 2019. Rural households\u2019 \nreal income and consumption expenditure increased faster than \nthose of urban residents thanks to growth in online shopping \nin rural areas and the government\u2019s Rural Vitalization Strategy, \nwhich boosts support for agricultural modernization, land \nreform, and financial services (Figure\u00a03.11.3). \n\nThe contribution of investment to growth slipped to 2.1 \npercentage points in 2018 from 2.3 points in 2017 because of \nan infrastructure investment downturn as local governments \ntightly controlled expenditure, both on budget and off budget, \nin the first 9 months of 2018 (Figure 3.11.4). Growth\u00a0in \ninfrastructure investment plummeted from 19.0% in 2017 to \n3.8% in 2018, though its declining trend reversed in Q4 of \n2018, and growth continued in early 2019 as more projects \nwere rolled out, financed mainly by a sharp increase in special \nbond issues by local governments.

Investment in high-tech manufacturing \nsuch as medical, electrical, and communication equipment kept \ngrowing at double-digit rates. Meanwhile, growth in real estate \ninvestment, comprising land purchases and new construction, \nincreased from 7.0% in 2017 to 9.5% in 2018. This trend \npersisted in early 2019 as property sales continued to exceed \nnew\u00a0property completed and as floor space waiting for sale \ndeclined. Net\u00a0exports dragged growth down by 0.6 percentage \npoints in\u00a02018, reversing a 0.6-point contribution in 2017, \nas\u00a0merchandise imports outgrew exports.\n\nOn the supply side, services remained the main driver of \n\ngrowth, despite slowing from 7.9% growth in 2017 to 7.6% \nlast year. Services contributed 3.9 percentage points to GDP \ngrowth, lifting the sector\u2019s share in GDP from 51.9% to 52.2% \n(Figure\u00a03.11.5). Growth was strong in transport, leasing and \ncommercial services, and information technology services, \nwhile financial and real estate services remained weak. \nThe\u00a0contribution to growth of industry including construction \nand mining remained unchanged at 2.4 percentage points as real \ngrowth in the sector moderated marginally from 5.9% in\u00a02017 \nto 5.8% in 2018. Strong increases in consumer, high-tech, and \nexport-oriented manufacturing partly offset deceleration in \nmining and raw materials, where retrenchment targets reined \nin production. Robust service sector growth helped edge down \nthe unemployment rate in cities, determined using a recently \ninstituted survey, from 5.0% in January to 4.9% in December \n2018; as fluctuation continued, unemployment rose again to 5.3% \nin February 2019. At the same time, media reports pointed to a \nweakening job market for fresh graduates and migrant workers \nin line with decelerating growth. A poor grain harvest and the \nspread of pig disease decelerated agriculture growth from 4.0% \nin 2017 to 3.5% in 2018, but the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP \ngrowth remained unchanged at 0.3 percentage points given its \nsmall share in GDP.\n\nIn 2018, consumer price inflation averaged 2.1%, up from \n1.6% in 2017 but softened at the beginning of 2019 (Figure\u00a03.11.6). \nSpikes in food prices, mostly caused by weather, and pricier \nhealth care, education, and rent, were key drivers of inflation. \nCore consumer inflation, excluding food and energy, stayed \nmodest at 1.9%, suggesting a steady underlying trend. Prices\u00a0for \nnewly constructed homes in the 70 largest cities were on average \n7.0% higher than a year earlier as inventories continued to \nshrink, with price increases more pronounced in the second \nand third tiers of this group (Figure 3.11.7). Average housing \nprices accelerated further in early 2019. Producer price inflation \nsoftened significantly to 3.5% from 6.5% in 2017. While this \nreflected a base effect following an index spike in 2017 owing \nto substantial supply-side reform, the decline in the second \nhalf of 2018 derived as well from weaker industrial activity. \nWith\u00a0further moderation in industry, producer prices stayed \nvirtually flat in January and February 2019. \n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n30\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3.11.3\u2002 Real growth in urban and \n\nrural household income and \nconsumption\u00a0expenditure\n\nUrban household income\nRural household income\nUrban household consumption expenditure\nRural household consumption expenditure\n\n% change year on year\n12\n\n  Q1 \n2014\n\nQ3   Q1 \n2015\n\nQ3   Q1 \n2016\n\nQ3   Q1 \n2017\n\nQ3   Q1 \n2018\n\nQ3\n\nQ = quarter.\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\n3.11.4\u2002Growth in fixed asset investment\n\nFixed asset investment\nInfrastructure\nManufacturing\nReal estate\n\n% change year to date\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul Jan\n2016\n\nJul Jan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n3.11.5\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\n\f196(cid:129)(cid:129)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nMonetary policy became more accommodative in mid-2018 \n\n3.11.6\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nto temper and smooth the growth slowdown. Through cuts \nin the reserve requirement ratio and liquidity injections via \nmedium-term lending facilities, the People\u2019s Bank of China, \nthe central bank, lowered interbank interest rates in the \nsecond half of 2018 (Figure 3.11.8), while leaving unchanged \nbenchmark 1-year lending and deposit rates. It eased the reserve \nrequirement in several steps from April 2018 to January 2019, \nlowering it for large banks from 17.0% to 13.5%. Nevertheless, \nbroad money (M2) growth remained at 8.1% in 2018, as in 2017. \nContinued tightening of regulations on shadow banking \ncaused it to contract, while outstanding bank loans were 12.7% \nhigher by the end of 2018. The contraction in shadow bank \nfinancing slowed growth in outstanding social financing\u2014a \nbroad measure of credit that includes elements of shadow \nbanking\u2014from 13.4% in 2017 to 9.8% (Figure 3.11.9). Despite \na rising corporate default rate and declining profits, bond \nissuance recovered in 2018 from a low base in 2017, and the \nvalue of corporate bonds outstanding grew by double digits. \n\nFiscal policy was tight in the first half of 2018 but loosened \n\nin the second half. Besides increases in special bond issues \nin August and September 2018, the government revised the \npersonal income tax law to ease the tax burden on low- and \nmiddle-income earners. This cushioned moderation in private \nconsumption in Q4 of 2018. Expansionary fiscal policy \ncontinued in Q4 as the revised personal income tax law went \ninto effect on 1 October 2018 and the government strongly \nincreased spending on rural infrastructure, employment, social \nsecurity, and environmental protection. Growth in consolidated \ncentral and local government revenue slowed to 1.0% in second \nhalf of 2018, sharply down from 10.6% in the first half, while \ngrowth in consolidated fiscal budget expenditure increased \nfrom 7.8% to 9.5%. The on-budget deficit thus rose from \nthe equivalent of 3.7% of GDP in 2017 to 4.2%, contributing \nto a rise in outstanding government debt (Figure 3.11.10). \nActual\u00a0government support to the economy should have \nbeen recorded as larger, as these figures exclude off-budget \nexpenditure, which has been large in the past and was unlikely \nto have declined substantially in 2018.\n\nExternal trade expanded in 2018. With exports to the \nUS having profited from frontloaded orders in mid-2018, \nand despite some deceleration in both export and \nimport growth in Q4, merchandise exports grew by 9.1% \nin\u00a02018, or 7.1\u00a0percentage points less than import growth. \nThe\u00a0merchandise trade surplus shrank in 2018, and data for \nJanuary\u2013February 2019 signaled further trade deceleration. \nAs the deficit in the service balance widened further in line \nwith the rising trend in outgoing tourism in recent years, the \ncurrent account surplus narrowed to 0.4% of GDP in 2018 from \n1.4% in 2017 (Figure\u00a03.11.11).

Net capital outflows \nexcluding FDI but including errors and omissions are estimated \nto be virtually unchanged because the central bank reintroduced \nregulatory measures to curb them, as described in ADO 2018 \nUpdate. Official gross international reserves fell by $68 billion to \nstand at $3.2 trillion at the end of 2018. \n\nThe renminbi strengthened in 2018 by 1.2% in nominal \neffective terms (against a trade-weighted basket of currencies) \nand by 0.9% in real effective terms (taking inflation into \naccount), while it weakened in nominal terms by 5.0% against \nthe US dollar (Figure 3.11.12). Depreciation had multiple causes, \nincluding lost momentum in the domestic economy, uncertainty \nrelated to the trade conflict, a smaller current account surplus, \nand, as domestic interest rates declined while US rates rose, \na narrower yield spread that had favored PRC bonds over \nUS\u00a0Treasuries. Amid ongoing trade talks, the renminbi rallied \nagainst the dollar in early 2019. \n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n-7\n\n-14\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe downward trend in GDP growth is expected to continue \nin 2019 and 2020 as uncertainty pertaining to trade tensions \nwith the US continues to weigh on domestic consumption and \ninvestment, and as restrictions on shadow banking remain in \nplace. Growth is expected to slow to 6.3% in 2019 and, reflecting \nongoing efforts to contain risk in the financial sector, moderate \na bit further to a more sustainable 6.1% in\u00a02020 (Figure 3.11.13). \nMonetary and fiscal policy are expected to remain supportive, \nbut no major stimulus is expected. The\u00a0policy, which in the \nsecond half of 2018 aimed to prevent a sharp deceleration \nin growth but not to raise the growth rate, should continue. \nAn\u00a0agreement with the US in 2019 would limit adverse effects \nfrom the trade conflict and help revive consumer and investor \nsentiment. However, growth will be lower as ongoing restrictions \non shadow banking continue to limit expansion in credit to the \neconomy, albeit partly compensated by fiscal support. \n\nOn the demand side, consumption will remain the main \ndriver of growth, though consumption growth is expected to \nmoderate slightly in line with slowing growth in household \nincome. Consumer staples are expected to hold up well, but \ndiscretionary consumer spending will likely remain subdued \nin the short run before recovering later in 2019. The expected \ngradual loosening in 2019 of local housing market restrictions \nwill boost property-related consumer spending, supporting \nretail sales in late 2019 and 2020. Growth in disposable income \nwill likely slow because the economic slowdown has started to \naffect the labor market.

Government \nsupport for high technology and continued industrial upgrading \nshould ensure that investment in manufacturing keeps \ngrowing but at a reduced rate as manufacturing profits decline, \ngrowth slows, and external trade loses its luster. Investment \nin real\u00a0estate is expected to hold up well as housing market \nrestrictions gradually loosen. Net exports are projected to \ncontinue to drag on growth in 2019 as the current account \nsurplus wanes and edges into deficit in 2020.\n\nOn the supply side, services are expected to outgrow \n\nindustry. Value added in financial services should grow solidly, \ndriven by solid bank profits from expanded lending, while \nconstruction and services related to real estate will benefit from \nexpected recovery in the housing market. Headwinds will likely \nmoderate manufacturing growth, especially as trade growth \nslows in 2019, though government support will help high-tech \nmanufacturing and innovative industries continue to grow \nrapidly. Mining is expected to suffer under lower commodity \ndemand, given slower domestic and global growth, while \nupstream industries, especially steel and cement, are set to profit \nfrom rising construction of both infrastructure and housing. \nAgriculture is expected to grow steadily as in previous years.\n\nThe outlook for the labor market is less robust. Moderation \n\nin consumption growth and less dynamic foreign trade are \nexpected to dampen demand for low-skilled and blue-collar \nworkers. However, some companies, especially state-owned \nones, may find it difficult to lay off workers, affecting their \nprofitability. This could increase corporate debt in the form \nof bank credit and bond issues, as access to alternative \nfinancing, especially from shadow banks, will remain difficult \n(Figure\u00a03.11.10).\n\na largely stable renminbi against the US dollar, and sharply \nlower producer prices, consumer price inflation will remain \nmoderate, edging down from 2.1% in 2018 to 1.9% in 2019 and \n1.8% in 2020 (Figure 3.11.14). Apart from potentially volatile food \nprices, spending on health remains the main driver of inflation. \nAt the same time, reform to pharmaceutical procurement, \ncurrently planned on a trial basis, may be rolled out on a broader \nscale to contain medical costs. Producer prices may fall a bit \nfurther from their high base and even decline briefly, but they \nwill stabilize as demand for construction materials rises under \ncontinued high infrastructure investment and the pickup in \nhousing construction later in 2019.\n\n$ billion\n\n150\n\n75\n\n0\n\n-75\n\n-150\n\n-225\n\n-300\n\n110\n\n106\n\n102\n\n98\n\n94\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3.11.11\u2002 Balance of payments\n\nCurrent account balance\nNet foreign direct investment flows\nNet non-foreign direct investment flows\nErrors and omissions\n\nQ1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1\n2016\n2015\n2014\n\nQ3 Q1 Q3 Q1\n2018\n\n2017\n\nQ3\n\nQ = quarter.\nSources: State Administration of Foreign Exchange; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n3.11.12\u2002Renminbi exchange rates\n\nUSD/CNY\nReal effective\nNominal effective\n\nJanuary 2017 = 100\n\ndepreciation\n\nJan\n2017\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nOct Jan\n2019\n\nSources: Bank for International Settlements; People\u2019s Bank \nof China; ADB estimates.\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nUnder declining domestic growth, lower global oil prices, \n\n3.11.13\u2002GDP growth\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002199\n\nMonetary policy is expected to become more \n\n3.11.14\u2002Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n3.11.15\u2002 Bank loan and interbank \n\ninterest\u00a0rates\n\nWeighted average bank \nlending rate\n\nShanghai interbank \noffered rate: 3 months\n\nShare of loans priced\nabove benchmark rate\n\n%\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n  Jan\n2013\n\n  Jan\n2014\n\n  Jan\n2015\n\n  Jan\n2016\n\n  Jan\n2017\n\n  Jan\n2018\n\n  Jan\n2019\n\nSources: People\u2019s Bank of China; National Interbank \nFunding Center.\n\n%\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\naccommodative. Data on new bank loans in January\u2013February \n2019 suggest a slight pickup in bank credit. At the same time, the \nmonetary policy transmission mechanism has been undermined \nby banks\u2019 reluctance to lower lending rates as long as deposit \nrates remain unchanged. The central bank will continue to \ncut the reserve requirement ratio to ensure sufficient bank \nliquidity and keep interbank interest rates low, which should \nenable banks to lend on favorable terms to companies. In Q4 \nof 2018, following guidance from the central bank and the \nregulator, fewer loans were priced above the benchmark rate, \ndriving down the weighted average of interest rates charged \nby banks (Figure\u00a03.11.15). However, as long as deposit rates \nremain unchanged, banks will likely shy away from lowering \ntheir lending rates much further, partly because credit demand \nremains high as financing alternatives are drying up and partly \nbecause the risk of corporate default has increased as the \neconomy slowed. Going forward, the central bank has room \nto lower benchmark 1-year lending and deposit rates, thereby \nreducing financing costs for the real economy while preserving \nbanks\u2019 interest margin. Such loosening would benefit in \nparticular highly indebted enterprises by lowering their interest \npayments. \n\nState-owned and other larger companies enjoy better \naccess to bank loans than do private small- and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) because they generally offer better collateral, \nmore transparency, and lower default rates. The central bank \nand financial regulator may therefore find it necessary to lean \non banks to ensure that SMEs obtain credit at a reasonable cost. \nAt\u00a0the same time, while restrictions on shadow banking, the \nmain alternative financing vehicle for SMEs, are expected to \ncontinue through 2019 and 2020, they may be relaxed to allow \nthe volume of outstanding shadow credit to be reduced more \ngradually. While both measures support growth in the short run, \nthey come at the potential cost of continued accumulation of \nrisk pertaining to shadow banks and more nonperforming loans \nfor\u00a0banks.\n\nFiscal policy became more expansionary in the second \nhalf of 2018, especially with increased special bond issues, but \nany large fiscal stimulus remains unlikely as the government \ncontinues to try to stabilize debt. Going forward, some support \nwill come from the government. A cut in the highest value-\nadded tax rate from 16% to 13%, and in the next highest rate \nfrom 10% to 9%, was approved at the National People\u2019s Congress \nin March 2019. The direct effect of the tax cut on growth will \nlikely be modest as only companies in markets with fierce \ncompetition will pass on the lower rates to customers. Further, \ngiven slowing economic growth, most firms are expected to save \nthe extra revenue instead of investing it. However, as growth \nin tax revenue slows along with the economy, these cuts will \n\n\f200(cid:129)(cid:129)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nput additional pressure on the budget, limiting the increase in \npublic spending, especially for local governments, which receive \nhalf of the value-added tax collected but are not allowed to raise \ntaxes or issue public debt without central government approval. \nThe\u00a0deficit in the consolidated budget, at 4.2% in 2018, is \nexpected to be higher in both 2019 and 2020. Local and central \ngovernment debt alike are expected to increase in both years. \n\nTo sustain a revival in infrastructure investment that started \n\nin Q4 of 2018, local governments have been authorized to \ncontinue issuing special bonds to finance infrastructure before \nthe 2019 budget is finalized. The annual special bond quota will \nrise from CNY1.35 trillion in 2018 to CNY2.15 trillion. This quota \nwill likely remain high in 2020 to enable local governments to \nreduce their off-budget financing for infrastructure.\n\nThe current account is forecast to be in balance in 2019. \nMerchandise exports are expected to decelerate in 2019 in the \naftermath of frontloaded exports to the US in mid-2018, and in \nlight of forecast slower growth in Europe, which will weaken \ndemand for PRC exports. At the same time, imports are projected \nto grow much less than in 2018 with decelerating growth in \ndomestic demand, and the widening of the service trade deficit \nis expected to slow in line with lower import growth and only a \nmoderate rise in outbound tourism. In 2020, the current account \nis expected to cross into deficit as declining global growth \nhampers export demand while the service deficit persists.\nNotwithstanding recent government steps to improve \ninvestment opportunities for foreigners, FDI inflows are \nprojected to moderate slightly in the shadow of the trade conflict \nwith the US and as supply chains consequently reorganize \nsomewhat away from the PRC. FDI outflows will also be lower \nowing to tight capital controls and greater scrutiny of FDI \ninflows in the advanced economies. Inflows of capital will pick \nup as foreign investors continue to acquire PRC bonds and \nstocks to diversify their portfolios despite the narrowing spread \nbetween PRC and US bond yields (Figure\u00a03.11.16). These inflows \nwill help compensate for deterioration in the current account, \nwhile unregistered capital outflows are expected to remain \nmoderate under strict capital controls.\n\nThe forecast is subject to external uncertainties and domestic \nrisks. The main downside international risk is any intensification \nof the trade conflict with the US in the absence of a durable \ndeal. This could have spillover effects, damaging investor and \nconsumer sentiment. On the upside, a comprehensive trade deal \nthat covers intellectual property rights protection, technology \ntransfer, market access, and the role of state-owned enterprises, \nthough unlikely, would assuage uncertainty and provide a more \nstable external environment. A domestic downside risk is that \npolicy makers see measures to stabilize growth as insufficient, \nabandon efforts to stabilize lending, and/or loosen restrictions \non shadow banking, thereby allowing nonbank financing to \n\n3.11.16\u2002 Spread between PRC and US treasury \n\nbond and note yields\n\nUS Treasury note yield\n(10 years)\nPRC Treasury bond yield\n(10 years)\n\nSpread PRC/US\n\n% per annum\n\nPercentage points\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States.\nNote: Yields are period average of monthly yields. \nSources: National Interbank Funding Center; \nFederal\u00a0Reserve Board; ADB estimates.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002201\n\n3.11.17\u2002 Real household income growth \n\nand\u00a0real GDP growth\n\nGross domestic product\nHousehold income\n\n% change year on year\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ3 Q1\n2016\n\nQ3 Q1\n2017\n\nQ3 Q1\n2018\n\nQ3\n\nQ = quarter.\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\nreaccelerate and debt to balloon. Such measures would boost \ngrowth in the short run but endanger financial stability over \nthe longer term. Sustaining growth in the PRC depends instead \non continued efforts to control financial leverage and on \naccelerated structural reform.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reforming social security \ncontributions\nSince the PRC shifted its growth model toward higher domestic \nconsumption during the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, \nconsumption has become the main contributor to growth, \nfueled by solid increases in household income (Figure 3.11.17). \nHowever, private consumption is likely to face headwinds as \nthe economy slows, the job market weakens, and wage growth \ndecelerates. The government reinforced its support for private \nconsumption when it introduced personal income tax reform \ncomprising new tax brackets and a higher standard allowance \neffective on 1 October 2018, with more specific additional \ndeductions effective on 1 January 2019. It\u00a0is debatable, though, \nthat such policies can sustainably raise household consumption \nto support growth and bring about economic rebalancing. \nThe\u00a0potential for more consumer spending in the PRC is limited \nby a high savings rate largely necessitated by a social safety net \nthat is much weaker than in the advanced economies. \n\nIn the medium term, enhancing the social security system \n\nremains pivotal to lowering households\u2019 precautionary \nsavings, provided that it is carried out in a manner that \navoids causing unemployment and strengthens job growth. \nHigher\u00a0unemployment would undermine consumption, \nespecially because the social safety net remains weak. \nWith\u00a0this concern in mind, the National People\u2019s Congress \napproved in March\u00a02019 a rate cut for employers\u2019 contributions \nto pension funds, lowering it from 19%\u201320% of the wage bill \nto 16%. While this was a step in the right direction, other \nanomalies remain. First, pension contribution rates are set by \neach province and vary from 14% in Zhejiang and Guangdong \nto 19%\u201320% in most other provinces (though capped at 16% \nfrom May 2019, following the recent decision). Moreover, these \ncontributions are pooled within provinces. These features limit \nthe transferability of pensions nationwide and probably hinder \nlabor mobility. According to the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, \n2016\u20132020, pension contributions should be pooled nationwide \nby 2020. Attaining this goal may prove challenging. Pooling has \nbeen hampered by slow progress in standardizing contribution \nrates and because richer provinces see national pooling as \nredistribution. Yet addressing the problems of underreporting \nand nationwide pooling are essential to enhance efficiency and \ncreate room to lower nominal contribution rates. \n\n\f3.11.18\u2002 Social security contributions  \n\nas a share of GDP\n\nSSCs other than pensions\nPensions\n\nSSC share in GDP\n\nCNY trillion\n\n% of GDP\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\n2009\n\n2012\n\n2015\n\nSSC = social security contribution.\nSources: Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security; \nADB estimates.\n\n202(cid:129)(cid:129)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nA second important step toward improving the social \nsecurity system as a whole would be to address the following \ninefficiencies in the collection of social security contributions \n(SSCs), which include contributions not only to pensions \nbut also to cover medical care, unemployment, maternity, \nand work-related injury (Figure 3.11.18). High statutory SSC \nrates and the way they are determined create incentives \nfor employers to underpay contributions by underreporting \nsalaries. PRC social security law requires both employers \nand employees to make SSCs. Employers, though, bear the \nsignificantly larger share. A flat SSC contribution rate, slightly \ndifferent by province and locality, is applied to employees\u2019 \ngross salaries. With the latest cut to the pension component of \nSSCs, the national average rate for employers has dropped to \n30%\u2014still nearly double the 16% average in the 10 advanced \neconomies in the Group of 20. The average contribution \nrate for employees is 11%, similar to the average in the same \ncomparator group. Though an employee\u2019s salary in the previous \nyear serves as the basis for SSCs, those employees earning \nbelow a threshold must pay a fixed minimum amount, and \nthose earning above a threshold pay a fixed maximum amount. \nThe lower threshold is generally set at 60% of the previous \nyear\u2019s average local wage, and the top threshold at 300%. \n\nTo reduce their contributions, companies often underreport \n\nemployee salaries to the social security administration, which \ncannot check the reports because it has no access to tax data. \nAccording to a 2018 white paper on social security, only 27% \nof surveyed enterprises paid the full SSC based on employees\u2019 \nactual salaries. Others either based payments on underreported \nemployee salaries or paid the minimum contribution per \nemployee. These practices suppress the effective rate of SSCs, \nincluding for pensions. To consolidate the SSC base before \nlowering the contribution rate, the government decided to \ntransfer authority for SSC collection from the Ministry of \nHuman Resources and Social Security to the State Taxation \nAdministration, to which salaries are reported for tax\u00a0purposes. \nThis promised to make systematic underreporting more \ndifficult. However, the transfer, which was to occur on \n1\u00a0January 2019, was postponed in response to resistance from \nemployers that feared having to pay higher contributions as a \nresult. Despite\u00a0such resistance, the transfer of authority should \nbe pursued and speeded up to streamline the collection of SSCs. \nFinally, the government should pay legacy costs that arise \n\nfrom obligations to retirees who became eligible for state \npensions when the pension system was modified in\u00a01997. \nTo\u00a0raise pension fund revenues toward financing these \npayments, the government should implement its plans to raise \nboth the share of state-owned enterprise equity transferred \nto the pension fund, which currently stands at 10%, and the \ndividends state-owned enterprises pay out to their shareholders.\n\n\fRepublic of Korea\n\nDespite  strong  consumption  and  net  exports,  growth  slowed  in  2018.  Contracting \ninvestment and moderating export growth, though countered by significant fiscal stimulus \nto sustain domestic demand and consumption, will pare GDP growth a bit further in 2019 \nand  2020.  Inflation  will  remain  tame,  and  the  current  account  surplus  will  shrink  slightly \nin  both  years  but  remain  sizable.  Invigorating  youth  entrepreneurship  can  address  youth \nemployment  and  spur  broader  economic  dynamism.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP grew by 2.7% in 2018, down from 3.1% a year earlier and \nthe slowest expansion in the past 6 years. Consumption and \nnet exports each contributed 1.4 percentage points to GDP \ngrowth (Figure 3.12.1). Expenditure grew by 5.6%, propping up \ngovernment consumption and providing the biggest impetus to \ngrowth. Private consumption rose by 2.8% as a 16.4% hike in \nthe minimum wage outweighed the impact of a 3.8% increase \nin the unemployment rate as job creation plunged from 316,000 \nin 2017 to 97,000 last year. \n\nExport growth in real terms doubled from 1.9% in 2017 to \n4.0%, backed by strong sales of semiconductors, information \ntechnology products, and petrochemicals. Meanwhile, real \ngrowth in imports slowed from 7.0% in 2017 to 1.5% as demand \nsoftened for manufacturing inputs and as oil prices fell. \nInvestment slumped, subtracting 0.1 percentage points from \ngrowth as the uncertain trade environment weighed on firms\u2019 \ninvestment plans and the government took measures to rein \nin speculative property development. Machinery investment \nplunged from 14.6% growth in 2017 to 1.7%, and construction \ninvestment shrank by 4.0% as capital gains taxes on multiple \nhomes and property taxes were raised, and as plans were \nannounced to establish anti-speculation zones in Seoul. \n\nOn the supply side, services drove economic expansion as \nthe sector growth rate accelerated from 2.2% in 2017 to 2.9% \nand contributed 1.7 percentage points to GDP growth in 2018 \n(Figure 3.12.2). Growth in industrial output slowed sharply \nfrom 4.6% in 2017 to 2.5% as demand softened globally and \nlocally, industries outside of semiconductors such as shipping \nrestructured, input costs rose, and construction slowed. \n\nThis chapter was written by Cindy Castillejos-Petalcorin and Donghyun Park of \nthe Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.12.1\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nInvestment\nNet exports \nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n3.4\n\n2.8\n\n2.8\n\n2.7\n\n3.1\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Bank of Korea, Economics Statistics System.  \nhttp://ecos.bok.or.kr (accessed 5 February 2019).\n\n3.12.2\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nTaxes less subsidies\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Bank of Korea, Economics Statistics System.  \nhttp://ecos.bok.or.kr (accessed 5 February 2019).\n\n\f204(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nThe\u00a0contribution of industry to growth fell to 1.0 percentage \npoint. Agriculture recovered to 1.4% growth with favorable \nweather and higher livestock production.\n\nInflation was subdued by weak domestic demand and \na dismal job market. Reflectingr slower economic activity, \nconsumer price inflation decelerated from 1.9% in 2017 to \n1.5% last year, falling further below the official target of 2.0% \nset by the Bank of Korea, the central bank (Figure 3.12.3). \nInflation\u00a0climbed to 2.0% year on year in September, mainly \non higher food prices, and remained stable in the following \n2\u00a0months, but decelerated again to 1.3% in December as \nfood prices stabilized and housing prices retreated when \npolicies to cool an overheating property market came into \neffect. Core\u00a0inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, \nremained stable at\u00a01.2%.\n\nThe central bank maintained an accommodative monetary \n\nstance in 2018, motivated by tepid inflation and weakening \ndomestic demand. However, it did raise its benchmark interest \nrate once, by 25 basis points to 1.75% on 30 November 2018, \nin response to an increase in the US federal funds rate. \nBroad\u00a0money (M2) growth accelerated from 5.1% in 2017 to \n6.7% even as household credit expansion slowed with the \ncooling of the property market (Figure 3.12.4).\n\nFiscal policy also remained largely accommodative \n\nin\u00a02018. A $3.6 billion supplementary budget was introduced \nthat boosted business subsidies and aimed to reduce youth \nunemployment. Budgetary revenue decreased, however, as a \ntax on car purchases was lowered from 5.0% to 3.5% and as \nfuel taxes were cut by 15% in November. The budget and the \nsupplementary budget together recorded a deficit equal to 0.1% \nof GDP, compared with a deficit of 1.1% in 2017, and sovereign \ndebt rose from the equivalent of 38.2% of GDP in 2017 to 38.6%. \nFollowing a 20-year trend, the current account registered a \nsurplus in 2018, but the surplus fell to 4.6% of GDP from 4.9% \nthe year before as merchandise exports grew less strongly \nthan merchandise imports. Inbound foreign direct investment \nincreased by 14.2% to a record high of $38.9 billion in 2018, \nand the surplus in the overall balance of payments boosted \nofficial foreign reserves to $404.6 billion at the end of the year. \nThe\u00a0won appreciated by 2.6% on average against the US dollar \nin nominal terms and by 1.4% in real effective terms (against a \ntrade-weighted basket of currencies and taking inflation into \naccount).\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth will slow to 2.5% in 2019 and 2020 in line with lower \nexport growth (Figure 3.12.5).

Any positive impact from a renegotiated free trade \nagreement between the US and the Republic of Korea (ROK) is \nsimilarly overshadowed by global trends. \n\nThe strong performance by exports in 2018 will not be \n\nrepeated this year or next because of softening external \ndemand. The global information technology business cycle is \nheading into a slowdown and could undermine semiconductor \nexports, the largest ROK export category, accounting for nearly \n21% of merchandise exports. Shipments of semiconductors \nare already falling, as have new export orders from Germany, \nJapan, and the PRC. Import growth will be lower this year and \nnext, reflecting weaker domestic demand and lower world oil \nprices. However, the deficit in the service account will narrow \non higher tourist arrivals. On balance, the sizeable current \naccount surplus will shrink slightly in the next 2 years to equal \n4.1% of GDP in 2019 and 3.9% in 2020. \n\nGrowth in private consumption, which provides almost \nhalf of GDP, will likely falter under weak employment growth \ncoupled with pessimism regarding economic prospects \nand rising household debt, which equaled 95% of GDP as \nof September 2018 (Figure 3.12.7). On the other hand, the \ngovernment\u2019s target to create 150,000 jobs this year will, \nif\u00a0achieved, improve household incomes. Public consumption \nwill receive a boost from additional spending in the run-up to \ngeneral elections in April 2020. Investment will likely remain \nsubdued this year but recover slightly next year. Construction \ninvestment will continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace, as \nthe government\u2019s efforts to cool the property market constrain \ngrowth. Public spending on the 5G telecommunications \nnetwork and transport infrastructure should spur moderate \ngrowth in fixed investment. \n\nConsumer price inflation remained tepid, rising by \nonly 0.5% year on year in February 2019 as transport and \ncommunications prices declined. Headline inflation is forecast \nto edge down to 1.4% in 2019 and 2020, held down by falling \ninternational oil prices and softening domestic demand.\n\nMonetary policy will remain broadly accommodative in \n2019 and 2020, supporting growth while mitigating risks in \nthe finance and property sectors. As the US Federal Reserve \nis planning interest rate hikes at a slower pace this year \n(with\u00a0only two hikes now expected in 2019, down from three \nhikes projected earlier), and in the absence of any major \nshock, there will be no need for the central bank to increase \ninterest rates. That should be welcomed in the ROK in light \nof the low growth rate forecast and high household debt. \n\n3.12.6\u2002Purchasing managers\u2019 index\n\nThreshold\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nNote: Nikkei, Markit.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 14 March 2019).\n\n3.12.7\u2002Consumer confidence\n\nIndex\n\n53\n\n50\n\n47\n\n44\n\nIndex\n\n125\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nNote: A reading below 100 means that fewer consumers \nanswered positively than negatively.\nSource: Bank of Korea, Economics Statistics System. \nhttp://ecos.bok.or.kr (accessed 14 February 2019).\n\n3.12.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2.5\n\n1.4\n\n4.1\n\n2.5\n\n1.4\n\n3.9\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n\f3.12.8\u2002Fiscal spending, 2008\u20132019\n\nInitial budget\nSupplementary budget\n\nW trillion \n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n%\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2014\n\n2017\n\n2019\nForecast\n\nSource: Ministry of Economy and Finance.\n\n3.12.9\u2002Unemployment rate\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2019\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 February 2019).\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul Oct\n\nApr\n\n206(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nIndeed,\u00a0given\u00a0the sluggish job market, and the expected \ncompletion of the US monetary tightening cycle, monetary \npolicy is likely to become more accommodative toward the end \nof 2019.\n\nIn a renewed effort to revitalize the economy, the 2019 \nbudget authorizes $420 billion in expenditure\u2014equal to 24.8% \nof GDP, 11.6% higher than in the 2018 budget and the biggest \nincrease since 2009\u2014to fund health, welfare, and education \nprograms and lend support to local governments (Figure\u00a03.12.8). \nRevenue will expand by 6.3% with corporate and other tax \nhikes. This will leave budget deficits equal to 1.8% of GDP in \n2019 and 2.3% in 2020, nudging up government debt to the \nequivalent of 40.2% of GDP at the end of next year.\n\nUpside risks to the outlook include growth in the global \neconomy and the PRC that exceeds expectations, a successful \nresolution of the US\u2013PRC trade dispute, and an improving \nrelationship with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \nHowever, most risks are on the downside. Moderating growth \nglobally\u2014and especially the slowdown in the PRC, the largest \ntrade partner of the ROK\u2014will weigh on growth. Worsening \nprotectionism and the unresolved trade dispute between the \nPRC and the US will hurt ROK exports, given their place \nin Asian supply chains. Another risk could be unexpected \nfinancial instability in emerging markets in response to \nmonetary tightening in major economies as central banks \ncontinue to normalize their policies throughout 2019 and 2020. \nThe principal domestic risks to the outlook are high household \ndebt, which may dampen consumption more than forecast, \nand the possibility that with the higher minimum wage and a \nshorter work week, local companies may be unwilling to hire \nnew workers, worsening unemployment from its already high \nrate in January (Figure 3.12.9).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014revitalizing youth \nentrepreneurship\nWeak entrepreneurship is viewed as contributing to the recent \nslowdown of growth in the ROK. Considered together with a \nrapidly aging population, this trend raises concern over the \nprospects for economic growth in the long term. However, \ndemographic change aside, the ROK retains an abundance of \nyouthful energy. As recent research by Edward Lazear shows, \nyouthful countries tend to be entrepreneurial. Fostering youth \nentrepreneurship is therefore key to catalyzing growth and to \nreducing youth unemployment, which has emerged in recent \nyears as a major economic and social issue. \n\nAccording to surveys by the Korea Institute of Startup & \nEntrepreneurship Development, entrepreneurship among those \n29 years old and under is anemic. While the number of startups \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nRepublic of Korea\u2002\u2002207\n\n3.12.10\u2002 Total early stage entrepreneurial \n\nactivity, 2016\n\n18\u201324 years old\n25\u201330 years old\n\n%\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nROK\n\nGER\n\nFIN\n\nISR\n\nPRC\n\nUS\n\nISR = Israel, FIN = Finland, GER = Germany, \nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China, ROK = Republic of \nKorea, US\u00a0=\u00a0United States.\nNote: Total entrepreneurial activity is the percentage of \nmembers of an age group that own or manage a business \nthat is less than 42 months old.\nSource: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2017.\n\nin the ROK rose by 6.4% in 2013\u20132015, youth startups plunged \nby 40.5%, and their share of the total dropped from 3.0% to \n0.9%. The rate at which youth startups survive is significantly \nlower than the overall rate. Further, according to the Global \nEntrepreneurship Monitor, youth entrepreneurship in the ROK \nas a share of all startups nationally substantially lags behind \nother innovative economies such as Israel, the PRC, and the US \n(Figure 3.12.10). The Hyundai Research Institute reports that \nyouth entrepreneurship in the ROK tends to be skewed toward \nwholesale and retail trade, accommodation, and restaurants, \nwhere entry barriers such as technological knowhow \nrequirements are low but the potential to create high-quality \njobs is limited. More broadly, self-employment in the ROK is \ntrending down as a share of all youth employment.\n\nThese surveys reveal that limited access to finance \nremains the biggest challenge to youth entrepreneurship. \nThe government has established various funds, including \npolicy funds for youth entrepreneurship, to facilitate more \naccess. It\u00a0has taken other steps to create an environment \nthat encourages private firms and financial institutions to \ndiscover, nurture, and invest in or acquire promising startups. \nThese\u00a0steps facilitated an increase by more than 10% per year \nin new private venture capital investments from 2011 to 2015, \nenabling more startups. Going forward, any initiatives and \nfiscal incentives that the government offers should be directed, \nto the extent possible, to the more innovative industries and \nactivities, and to those that promise to create the most jobs. \nExcessive regulation remains another major impediment \nto innovative entrepreneurship. In stark contrast with the US \nand the PRC, which enforce negative lists of activities and \ntechnologies closed to startups, the ROK has a more restrictive \npositive list that specifies only a few business activities and \nareas open to them. Without a fundamental overhaul of this \nstifling regulatory framework, innovative entrepreneurship is \nunlikely to put down roots in the ROK. \n\nRegulations could be relaxed to allow, in particular, \n\nthe establishment of \u201csandbox zones,\u201d in which youth \nentrepreneurs are free to develop new products and services \nand to experiment with fresh ideas, constrained by only \nminimal regulation. Policy support can be extended for \nyouth entrepreneurs to venture abroad at an early stage of \ntheir enterprise development to get a sense of the global \nmarketplace. Meanwhile, the successful transformation of \nscience and technology universities in the US into vibrant \ncradles of youth entrepreneurship, such as the Martin Trust \nCenter for Entrepreneurship at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, can provide models for enhancing education in \nthe\u00a0ROK.\n\n\fTaipei,China\n\nSofter  external  demand  tamped  down  growth  in  2018,  and  inflation  remained  low  even \nas it doubled with higher food and transportation prices. Growth is expected to moderate \nfurther in 2019 and 2020 as global growth slows and business sentiment wanes.  Inflation \nshould  trend  down  as  oil  prices  moderate,  and  the  current  account  surplus  will  shrink  as \nexport growth slows. Improving export competitiveness is essential for diversifying exports \nin  terms  of  both  products  and  destinations.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth moderated from 3.1% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018 \nas export growth decelerated with softer external demand. \nGrowth in exports to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nwhich accounted for 28.8% of the total, slowed sharply from \n20.4% in 2017 to 8.8%, while growth in exports to the US, \nthe second biggest market, slowed to 7.5%, dragging total \nexport growth down by more than half to 5.9%. Exports\u00a0of \nmanufactured goods and of machinery and transport \nequipment were especially hit, rising by only a fraction of \ntheir 2017 growth rate. As the decline in import growth was \nmore moderate, from 12.5% in 2017 to 10.6% last year, net \nexports deducted 0.5 percentage points from GDP growth \n(Figure\u00a03.13.1).\n\nDomestic demand, in particular investment, was the engine \n\nof growth. Gross capital formation expanded by 6.1% in 2018, \nreversing a decline in 2017 and adding 1.3 percentage points to \nGDP growth as public infrastructure investment accelerated \nand spurred private investment. Consumption added 1.6 points \nto growth as government consumption recovered from a \ndecline of 0.6% in 2017 to increase by 3.5% on election-related \nspending, but private consumption grew less than in 2017. \nThe\u00a0unemployment rate edged down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.7%.\nOn the supply side, growth in services improved from \n2.5% in 2017 to 2.6%, adding 1.6 percentage points to growth. \nIt was sustained by tourist arrivals that rose by 3.0% in 2018 \nas a decline in arrivals from the PRC was offset by increases \nfrom Southeast Asia, Japan, and the US (Figure 3.13.2). \nIndustry growth slowed as production for export moderated \nbut still added 1.1 points to growth, while the contribution of \nagriculture was minimal.\n\nThis chapter was written by Irfan Qureshi and Nedelyn Magtibay-Ramos of \nthe Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.13.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth\n\n5 -year \n\nImports of goods and services\nExports of goods and services\nInvestment\nGovernment consumption\nPrivate consumption\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n4.0\n\n3.1\n\n2.6\n\n1.5\n\n0.8\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n3.13.2\u2002Growth of tourist arrivals\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n%\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n-25\n\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n\nPRC HKG \n& MAC\n\nJapan ASEAN US\n\nTotal\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \nHKG\u00a0=\u00a0Hong Kong, China, MAC = Macau, China, \nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States.\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nTaipei,China\u2002\u2002209\n\nAverage inflation more than doubled to 1.3% in 2018 on \n\n3.13.3\u2002 Inflation\n\nThe current account surplus narrowed from the equivalent \n\n3.13.4\u2002Exchange rates\n\nNominal\n\nReal effective\n\nNT$/$\n\nIndex, 2010 = 100\n\nOverall\nFood\nWholesale price index\nCore\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n105\n\n100\n\n95\n\n90\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nrising prices for food, transportation, and communication \n(Figure 3.13.3).

Gross foreign exchange reserves grew by \n2.3% in 2018. The local dollar appreciated by 0.9% against the \nUS dollar, by 0.5% in nominal effective terms (against a trade-\nweighted basket of currencies), and by 0.7% in real effective \nterms (taking inflation into account) (Figure 3.13.4).\n\nEconomic prospects \nEconomic expansion is expected to moderate this year and \nnext, reflecting the impact of the global economic slowdown, \ntrade tensions, and deteriorating business sentiment. \nThe\u00a0Nikkei manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index \ntumbled in January\u00a02019 at its fastest pace in more than \n3\u00a0years. GDP\u00a0growth is therefore forecast at 2.2% in 2019 and \n2.0% in\u00a02020. Services\u00a0will make the largest contribution \nto growth this year and next on the growing strength of \ntourism. Planned\u00a0cuts to individual income tax may also boost \nconsumption. Meanwhile, substantial investment growth in \n2018 is expected to become tepid this year and next, though kept \npositive by outlays under the Forward-looking Infrastructure \nDevelopment Program and recent government incentives for \ninvestors, such as income tax credits for 5G mobile networks and \nsmart machinery investments. \n\nExport growth is projected to moderate primarily in response \n\nto weakening global economic conditions and US\u2013PRC trade \ntensions. Exports of semiconductors to the PRC, used as inputs \nfor PRC products exported to the US, are particularly likely \nto be adversely affected. Imports\u00a0of\u00a0capital\u00a0and\u00a0intermediate \n\n\fThe budget deficit is projected to shrink from the \n\n3.13.5\u2002 Main exports destinations, \n\n210(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\ngoods are likely to remain modest, considering weakness in \nexport demand, and overall import growth will slow further. \nOn\u00a0balance, net exports are expected to contribute little to \nGDP growth this year and next. The trade surplus is projected \nto trend downward, narrowing the current account surplus to \nthe equivalent of 6.0% of GDP in 2019 and 2020, despite a likely \nincrease in net receipts from services on continuing strength in \ninbound tourism. \n\nInflation is forecast to slow to 1.1% in 2019 in line with a \ngradual decline in oil prices and then edge up to 1.2% in 2020 \nas the currency weakens along with the current account. \nGiven\u00a0the tame inflation forecast, the central bank will likely \nkeep its policy rate unchanged at least until the end of 2019. \n\nequivalent of 0.3% of GDP in 2018 to a mere 0.03% as revenue \ngrows more than expenditure despite planned income tax \nreform. The outstanding debt of the central government has \ndeclined in recent years and is projected to equal 32.2% of \nGDP at the end of 2019, which is well below the 40.6% ceiling \nmandated by the Public Debt Act. As the debt is entirely \ndomestic, there is little exchange rate risk. \n\nDownside risks to the outlook are external threats, \n\nsuch\u00a0as further worsening of global trade tensions or a deeper \nslowdown in the advanced economies and the PRC, which \nmight reduce demand for exports. Tighter global financial \nconditions, in particular unexpectedly high interest rates \nin the US, could reduce capital flows into Taipei,China. \nPossessing\u00a0ample fiscal reserves, however, Taipei,China is in a \nposition to address threats as they materialize. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014diversifying exports \nby\u00a0raising competitiveness\nRising global trade tensions and the slowdown in the \nmajor industrial economies and the PRC pose significant \nrisks for an export-oriented economy like Taipei,China. \nThese\u00a0vulnerabilities are accentuated by high concentration \nof exports in terms of both products and destinations. Data on \nexport concentration in 1995 and 2017 show more than half of \nexports going to the top three export destinations: the\u00a0PRC \nand then the US and Hong Kong, China (Figure\u00a03.13.5). \nData\u00a0further show that the top five exported goods occupy \na larger portion of total exports than in peer economies \n(Figure 3.13.6). Moreover, the number of products exported \nby Taipei,China has increased only marginally and has yet to \ncatch up with the major industrial economies (Figure 3.13.7). \nTo\u00a0reduce vulnerability to external shocks, the government \nseeks to diversify exports by generating comparative advantage \nin a wider range of products, which should also help to expand \nthe scope of export destinations.\n\n3.13.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2.2\n\n1.1\n\n6.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.2\n\n6.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nTaipei,China\n\nUnited States\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nHong Kong, China\nEuro area\nJapan\nASEAN-5\nOther countries\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1995\n\n2017\n\nASEAN-5 = Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam.\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n3.13.6\u2002Export share of top 5 commodities\n\n2005\n2017\n\nRepublic of\nKorea\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic\nof China\n\nTaipei,China\n\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nTaipei,China\u2002\u2002211\n\nTo diversify export destinations more directly, the \ngovernment has introduced its New Southbound Policy to \ndeepen economic ties with Australia, New Zealand, and \ncountries in Asia. The policy aims to encourage industrial \ncollaboration, conduct outreach sessions, provide strategic \nguidance, and organize trade promotions to gauge demand \nin nascent markets. The government also looks to sign \nmultilateral and bilateral free trade agreements. However, for \nthese initiatives to expand the operations of existing export-\noriented companies and encourage new export industries \nto emerge, exports need to become competitive in overseas \nmarkets. The first steps toward enhancing competitiveness \nare to improve exporters\u2019 emissions footprints and, more \nimportantly, ensure the adequacy of skilled labor supply. \nOwing to reliance on fossil fuels as a primary source \nof energy, a number of products are reportedly unable to \nmeet the emissions standard for world trade, making them \nless competitive. Possible approaches to reducing emissions \ninclude phasing out energy subsidies and offering financial \nincentives to develop low-carbon technology or switch to \nrenewable\u00a0energy.\n\nA shortage of skilled workers in Taipei,China was \ndocumented in a recent manpower survey. Alleviating this \nshortage requires a multipronged approach, which should \ninclude the following: First, planned income tax reform can \nbe amended to improve compensation for skilled workers, \nwhich has not kept pace with inflation even in major export \nindustries and is not internationally competitive. Second, \nfemale workforce participation, which is low at 51%, should be \nraised by offering special pensions, longer working years, and \nflexible parental leave. Third, the government should operate \ntraining\u00a0programs for local labor or extend incentives for \ncompanies to do so.\n\nFinally, overcoming barriers to forging new export \ndestinations requires innovation and entrepreneurship. \nIn 2006 and 2016, Taipei,China lagged behind its peers \nin the number of newly registered firms (Figures 3.13.8). \nThe indicator of new business density, which measures the \nnumber of newly registered firms per 1,000 working-age \npeople per calendar year, also shows Taipei,China lagging \nbehind its peers (Figure 3.13.9). While this shortcoming may \nhave multiple causes, providing a healthier entrepreneurial \necosystem will be an important step toward alleviating it. \nTo\u00a0this end, the government can help by encouraging research \nand development, funding business incubators in colleges and \nuniversities, and relaxing regulations to encourage the launch \nof new industries and products. \n\n3.13.7\u2002Number of export products\n\n2017\n1995\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nGermany\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nJapan\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nTaipei,China\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\n220\n\n230\n250\n240\nNumber of products\n\n260\n\nSource: UNCTADstat. https://unctadstat.unctad.org  \n(accessed 19 January 2019).\n\n3.13.8\u2002 Number of new limited \nliability\u00a0companies\n\nGermany\nHong Kong, China\nRepublic of Korea\nSingapore\nTaipei,China\n\nThousand\n\nThousand\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n700\n\n560\n\n420\n\n280\n\n140\n\n0\n\n2006 2008\n\n2010\n\n2012 2014\n\n2016\n\nSource: World Bank.

The outlook for growth is \nonly modest improvement in light of continuing security concerns, upcoming elections, and \ndeclining foreign assistance. Infrastructure development promises to be the foundation of \neconomic  growth  and  job  creation.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth is estimated to have slowed from 2.7% in 2017 to 2.2% \nin 2018, largely because of a severe drought (Figure 3.14.1). \nOn\u00a0the supply side, growth in agriculture shrank from 3.8% to \n2.0% as drought affected more than half of the country, causing \nwheat production to fall by 71% in rainfed \ufb01elds and by 6% in \nthe much smaller irrigated area. Industry picked up to grow \nby 2.0%, and services expanded by 2.5%, unchanged from the \nprevious year.\n\nAccording to estimates by the United Nations Office on \nDrugs and Crime, opium production decreased by 29% to 6,400 \ntons in 2018 after record-high production the year before, \nre\ufb02ecting decreasing yield because of prolonged drought and \nless area under poppy cultivation due to signi\ufb01cantly lower \nmarket prices following the glut in 2017. The farm gate value of \nopium fell by more than half to $604 million in 2018, equal to \n3% of Afghanistan\u2019s licit GDP.\n\nPublic consumption and investment both increased \nslightly on higher government budget expenditure in 2018. \nPrivate\u00a0consumption is estimated to have contracted as \ncontinued drought squeezed rural incomes, while business \nuncertainty caused private investment to decelerate. \nNet\u00a0exports continued to weigh on growth, probably \naggravated by the reimposition of international sanctions on \nneighboring Iran, one of Afghanistan\u2019s main trade partners.\n\nIn\ufb02ation slowed considerably from 5.0% in 2017 to average \n\n0.6% in 2018 as food in\ufb02ation fell steeply in the course of the \nyear to average 1.0%, and as food imports outweighed the \nshortfall in domestic food production (Figure 3.14.2). Nonfood \nin\ufb02ation was quite moderate at 2.3%, especially considering \nlarge increase in global oil prices during the year and \nsubstantial currency depreciation. \n\nThis chapter was written by Abdul Hares Halimi of the Afghanistan Resident Mission, \nADB, Kabul.\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nEstimate\n\nSources: World Development Indicators, World Bank \n(accessed 22 February 2019); ADB estimates.\n\n3.14.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n%             \n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n3.14.2\u2002Inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\nOther goods\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSource: Central Statistical Office (accessed 12 March 2019).\n\n\f216(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nAmid regional currency pressures, informal out\ufb02 ows of US \n\n3.14.3\u2002Nominal exchange rate\n\ndollars to Iran, and global strengthening of the US\u00a0currency, \nthe afghani depreciated by 8.6% against the US dollar \nin\u00a02018, reaching a record low in November (Figure 3.14.3). \nSharp\u00a0depreciation that started on 11 September was the result \nof speculation on the money market that led Da Afghanistan \nBank, the central bank, to stabilize the currency by boosting \nsales of US dollars in the \ufb01 nal months of the year by some 30% \nabove sales a year earlier.\n\nDomestic revenue is estimated to have reached 11.7% \nof GDP in 2018 thanks to enhanced tax administration and \ncompliance, as well as measures against corruption in the \ncustoms department. Foreign aid comprised 56.3% of budget \nrevenue, or 15.1% of GDP, to bring total revenue and grants \nto the equivalent of 26.4% of GDP. Government expenditure \nincreased to equal 26.8% of GDP, with development \nexpenditure at 7.8% of GDP. The operating budget de\ufb01 cit \nexcluding grants increased to equal 6.1% of GDP because of \nhigher security requirements and spending on pensions and \ncivil service wages.

Most transactions are in cash, \nwith currency in circulation amounting to about 17% of GDP. \nNonperforming loans declined slightly to 12% of total loans. \nDollarization is high, with the share of foreign-denominated \nloans at about 60%. \n\nThe current account surplus including offi  cial grants rose \n\nfrom the equivalent of 5.0% of GDP in 2017 to an estimated \n5.3% as offi  cial grants increased from 38.0% of GDP to an \nestimated 39.7% (Figure 3.14.5).

However, food prices are expected to remain \nlow\u00a0as agriculture recovers.\n\nThe 2019 budget presented a medium-term expenditure \n\nframework that foresees a less expansionary role for \ufb01 scal \npolicy. Domestic revenue is budgeted to increase to the \nequivalent of 12.0%\u00a0of GDP in 2019 and 12.3% in 2020. \nGrants\u00a0are projected to fall to 51.4% of budget revenue in 2019 \nand 45.5% in 2020.

Better \ninfrastructure can strengthen economic growth, enlist improved \nmobility to energize commerce and agriculture, and thereby \nboost government revenue available for development spending. \nAddressing\u00a0infrastructure gaps can improve opportunities for trade \nas well and enhance regional economic cooperation and integration, \nthe better to realize Afghanistan\u2019s potential as a transit hub \nconnecting Central\u00a0Asia with South\u00a0Asia and beyond.\n\nDespite some improvements to infrastructure, Afghanistan \n\nendures a severe infrastructure de\ufb01cit, with disparity between urban \nand rural areas particularly high. According to the Afghanistan \nLiving Conditions Survey, conducted in 2016 and 2017, only 36% \nof the population has access to safe drinking water nationally, \nincluding 75% of urban households but only 25% of rural households. \nOnly 31% of the population is connected to the electric grid, the \nprimary source of electrical power in urban areas with penetration \nat 92%, but reaching only 13% in rural areas. Only 63% of the \nrural\u00a0population lives within 2\u00a0kilometers of an all-season road, \nand road density is estimated at a low 15\u00a0kilometers per 100 square \nkilometers of territory, below densities achieved by Afghanistan\u2019s \nneighbors. Further, the quality of infrastructure is generally poor. \nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index, \nAfghanistan has consistently ranked in the bottom quintile for the \nquality of its infrastructure for trade and transport.\n\nRegulatory and administrative reforms have attempted to \nprovide a safer and more enabling environment for infrastructure \ninvestment. The government should accelerate its implementation \nof ongoing construction projects and upgrade its capacity to \ndesign, implement, and monitor investment projects. Moreover, \nthe\u00a0government should address skills shortages and stimulate \nprivate\u00a0sector investment in infrastructure development.\n\nFinally, the government should seek sustainable infrastructure \n\n\ufb01nancing and look at innovative approaches to increase access to \nfunding. Financing needed for the National Infrastructure Plan, \n2017\u20132021 of about $1 billion annually exceeds available resources \nfrom development partners, and domestic \ufb01scal resources for \nnew investment are limited. High security costs greatly add to \nproject costs. Debt-\ufb01nanced infrastructure investment carries \nrisks and would require adequate monitoring and macroeconomic \nmanagement. Attracting private capital for infrastructure requires \nfurther efforts to create an enabling legal and institutional \nenvironment. Addressing \ufb01scal risks is necessary to develop a \nstrong public\u2013private partnership framework. Finally, closing the \ninfrastructure gap should be pursued in tandem with developing \nstrong institutions and an agenda for regional cooperation.\n\n\fBangladesh\n\nGrowth  accelerated  in  fiscal  2018  on  higher  public  investment  and  stronger  consumption \ndemand  with  a  revival  in  exports.  Inflation  remained  moderate.  The  current  account \ndeficit  widened  with  surging  imports  despite  revived  remittances.  Growth  is  expected \nto  be  slightly  higher  in  both  fiscal  2019  and  2020  on  slowing  in  major  trading  partners. \nThe\u00a0current account deficit is forecast to shrink, and inflation to stay in check. To sustain \nhigher  investment  and  growth,  the  banking  system  requires  strengthening  reform.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth accelerated to 7.9% in fiscal year 2018 (FY2018, \nended 30 June 2018) from 7.3% in the previous year, as rising \ngrowth in total demand found support in higher consumption, \ninvestment, and exports (Figure 3.15.1). Continued political \ncalm, improved power supply, and higher growth in private \nsector credit facilitated the fastest economic expansion in \nBangladesh since 1974.\n\nOn the supply side, growth was lifted by improved \n\nexpansion in industry and agriculture. Industry grew by 12.1% \non strong production in large and medium-sized industries and \nhigher investment. Agriculture grew by 4.2% as quick policy \nresponse to flood-induced crop losses in the summer facilitated \na good winter harvest and buoyant horticulture output. \nGrowth in services moderated to 6.4% as expansion slowed in \ntransport, finance, education, and health care services. \n\nOn the demand side, strong private consumption that \nwas buoyed by a recovery in remittances provided the main \nlift to growth. Public investment also contributed, reflecting \nsubstantial progress in implementing large infrastructure \nprojects, notably the Padma Bridge and Dhaka Metro Rail. \nInvestment increased from the equivalent of 30.5% of GDP in \nFY2017 to 31.2% in FY2018 as public investment rose from 7.4% \nof GDP to 8.0% and private investment increased slightly to \n23.3%. A surge in imports made net exports a larger drag on \ngrowth than a year earlier despite the revival in exports.\n\nAverage inflation edged up from 5.4% in FY2017 to 5.8%. \n\nHeadline inflation year on year decelerated from 5.9% in \nJune 2017 to 5.5% as food inflation eased from 7.5% to 6.0%, \nbenefiting from the good winter harvest and large rice imports \n(Figure 3.15.2).

This was despite strong \ngrowth in private credit at 16.9%, notably for investment and \nimport financing. Net bank credit to the government declined \nby 2.5% as sales of national savings certificates provided much \nof the domestic financing of the budget deficit. \n\nWith declining net foreign assets pressuring bank liquidity, \nBangladesh Bank, the central bank, reduced the required cash \nreserve ratio by 1.0 percentage point to 5.5% and lowered the \nrepo rate by 75 basis points to 6.00% in April. This reduced \npressure on the call money rate and forestalled any marked \nincrease in bank lending rates, thereby supporting private \nsector growth. Banks\u2019 weighted average lending rate was \nnonetheless somewhat higher at 9.9% at the end of June 2018 \nthan a year earlier, when it was 9.4%. The weighted average \ndeposit rate also increased, from 4.7% to 5.5%, slightly \nnarrowing banks\u2019 interest rate spread (Figure 3.15.4). \n\nBudget revenue underperformed its target and declined \nfrom the equivalent of 10.2% of GDP in FY2017 to 9.6% with \nslower growth in value-added tax and supplementary duty \ncollection at the import stage, while nontax revenue collection \nalso underperformed. Government spending was lower than \nbudgeted and declined marginally to the equivalent of 13.5% \nof GDP, curbing current spending from 8.3% of GDP in FY2017 \nto 7.8%. The annual development program and other capital \nspending strengthened from 5.3% of GDP to 5.7% with the \nimplementation of the government\u2019s priority development \nprojects. The fiscal deficit increased from 3.4% of GDP in \nFY2017 to 3.9% in FY2018, well within the budget target of 5% \n(Figure 3.15.5). \n\nExport growth surged from 1.7% in FY2017 to 6.4% as \ngarment exports, accounting for over 80% of the total exports, \nrecovered from only 0.2% growth in FY2017 to 8.8% on \nstronger demand in the euro area. Other exports declined by \n7.0% on lower demand for a number of other manufactured \nproducts. Import payments surged from 9.0% growth in \nFY2017 to 25.2%, reaching $58.9 billion. Imports of capital \ngoods, food grains, and intermediate goods grew strongly. \nRemittances rebounded to grow by 17.3% to $15.0 billion, \nreflecting an increase in the number of workers going abroad \nin the past few years, a more favorable exchange rate, and \nmeasures to foster money transfer through official channels. \nDespite larger remittances, the current account deficit \ngrew abruptly from $1.3 billion in FY2017 to $9.8 billion, equal \nto 3.6% of GDP, as the surge in imports doubled the trade \ndeficit, and deficits in services and primary income widened \n\n3.15.3\u2002Growth of credit and money supply\n\nCredit to the private sector\nBroad money\nNet credit to the government\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan Apr\n2017\n\nJul Oct\n\nJul Oct\n\nJan Apr\n2018\n\nNote: Dotted lines denote ends of fiscal years.\nSource: Bangladesh Bank. 2019.

The government continues to \nprefer concessional external borrowing, especially to finance \ninfrastructure projects, raising external debt from 11.3% of \nGDP to 12.1%. Domestic debt increased only marginally, from \n15.7% of GDP to 15.8%, as the issuance of national savings \ncertificates slowed.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is expected to edge up to 8.0% in FY2019 on \nrobust private consumption aided by continued recovery \nin remittances (Figure 3.15.8). Public investment will \nremain strong as the government continues to expedite the \nimplementation of large infrastructure projects and other \nbig projects receiving overseas support. Private investment is \nexpected to rise, supported by measures to increase private \nsector credit, reform initiatives to improve the ease of doing \nbusiness, and plans to make several hundred industrial \nplots available in special economic zones. Despite a weaker \ngrowth outlook in key exports markets, earnings from apparel \nexports are expected higher as new destinations strengthen. \nTariff tensions between the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nthe US make Bangladesh an attractive alternative source of \nmanufactures.

In FY2020, agriculture is projected to \nedge up as government policy support continues. However, \nwith global growth continuing to slow, growth in industry is \nexpected to moderate slightly, and expansion in services is \nlikely to follow that trend.\n\nInflation is expected to ease from 5.8% last year to a \n\nFY2019 average of 5.5%, contained by a good harvest and lower \nglobal food and oil prices (Figure 3.15.9).

The central \nbank kept the main policy rates unchanged: the repo at 6.00% \nand the reverse repo at 4.75%. It set target ceilings for broad \nmoney growth at 12.0% and domestic credit at 15.9%, which \nis expected to both accommodate the GDP growth target and \ncontain inflation. Government borrowing appears on track \nwhile leaving adequate liquidity for private sector credit to \ngrow within the target ceiling of 16.5%. The central bank will \nregularly monitor bank adherence to guidelines to better align \ntheir lending with deposit mobilization. \n\nExports increased by 13.4% in the first 7 months of \nFY2019, doubling 6.6% growth in the year-earlier period \n(Figure\u00a03.15.10). Growth in readymade garment exports \naccelerated from 7.6% to 14.5%, benefiting from strong new \norders from retailers that are partly attributable to global trade \ntension elsewhere. Given high demand for low-end products \nand acknowledged improvement in factory safety standards, \nexports are expected to increase by 14.0% in FY2019 and a \nfurther 15.0% in FY2020.\n\nIn the first 6 months of FY2019, import growth slowed \nsteeply from the year-earlier rate of 25.2% to 5.7%. Although \nimports of intermediate and capital goods increased strongly \nin this period, imports of food grains and consumer goods \nmarkedly declined in the wake of high inventory building \nand food grain restocking in FY2018. On balance, imports are \nforecast to grow by 10.0% in FY2019 and 12.0% in FY2020.\nRemittance growth moderated from 16.6% in the first \n8 months of FY2018 to 10.0% in the same period this year \nafter the large improvement in FY2018 set a high base \n(Figure\u00a03.15.11). Government efforts have continued to \nreduce the cost of transferring remittances and to sideline \nunauthorized intermediaries.

Total spending \nis set to grow by 25.1% to equal 18.3% of GDP, with current \nspending equal to 9.9% of GDP and the annual development \nprogram and other capital spending at 8.4%. \n\nAttaining these high targets will be challenging in light of \nrecent developments. In the first 6 months of FY2019, growth \nin revenue collection by the National Board of Revenue plunged \nfrom 20.4% in the year-earlier period to 6.1%. Import taxes and \ndomestic indirect taxes have both been lower than expected \nwith import demand weaker. Achieving the high investment \nspending planned in the budget will demand concerted effort, \nconsidering that only 27.4% of the annual development program \nwas implemented in the first half of FY2019. However, as in \nthe past, shortfalls on both sides of the ledger are likely to be \nmanaged to yield a fiscal deficit within the budget target, equal \nto 5.0% of GDP. \n\nThe outlook is subject to downside risks. Failure to boost \nrevenue could crimp expenditure pledged for implementing \npriority projects. Global oil prices rising above expectations \ncould stoke inflationary pressure. Failure to improve \ngovernance, the investment climate, and infrastructure could \nundermine other development achievements. Finally, adverse \nweather is a perennial risk.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014promoting an \nefficient\u00a0banking system\nBanks play a key role in mobilizing and allocating resources \nfor investment, especially as Bangladesh lacks a mature capital \nmarket. As of June 2018, the country had 57 commercial banks \nwith 10,114 branches and combined assets of Tk13.9 trillion, \nequal to 62% of GDP. Loans and advances amount to about \ntwo-thirds of total assets. \n\nBanks fall into four categories: 6 state-owned commercial \nbanks (SCBs), 2 state-owned development financial institutions \n(DFIs), 40 domestic private commercial banks (PCBs), and \n9\u00a0foreign commercial banks (FCBs). They operate under the \nregulation and supervision of the central bank.

The ratio of gross NPLs to total loans \npeaked at 41.1% at the end of 1999\u2014the upshot of loans granted \nafter only weak appraisal, directed lending programs during \n1970s and 1980s, weak follow-up on repayment, and reluctance \nto write off long-standing bad loans because of the poor quality \nof underlying collateral and fear of possible legal complications. \nHowever, the ratio of NPLs steadily decreased to 6.1% at the \nend of 2011 with provisioning, write-offs, and a sharp reduction \nin new bad debt. NPLs rebounded, with some fluctuation, \nto 10.3% at the end of December 2018, partly reflecting a \ntightening of loan classification standards. The NPL ratio at \nSCBs then was about five times that of PCBs and FCBs.\n\nProfitability at SCBs, measured as bank return on assets \nand return on equity, has been negative and below the industry \naverage since 2014 because of higher provision requirements \nand operational inefficiency. The authorities were therefore \nrequired to inject capital into them on several occasions, still \nleaving the SCB capital adequacy ratio at only 2.0% as of \nJune\u00a02018 (Table 3.15.4). It will be a challenge for them to meet \nthe Basel\u00a0III requirement by 2019 of a capital adequacy ratio \nat 12.5% of risk-weighted assets. PCBs and FCBs, by contrast, \nhave maintained stronger capital positions and enjoyed higher \nreturn on equity. \n\nBetter governance is required in the banking sector. \n\nIndications of weak governance are a high ratio of expenditure \nto income, high administrative and operating expenses, lending \nwith scant appraisal, weak credit monitoring, a lack of integrity \nand compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and \ninefficient appointments in management.\n\nTo address banking sector issues, the authorities have \ntaken a number of measures under past reform programs: \nenforcing stronger regulations, introducing a bankruptcy\u00a0law, \nestablishing money loan courts and a credit information \nbureau, corporatizing SCBs, applying a uniform guideline \nfor writing off loans, changing loan classification and \nloan-loss provision, restructuring policy for large loans above \nTk5\u00a0billion, the phased introduction of Basel III, and promoting \na number of measures for good corporate governance. Although \nthese initiatives have brought some improvements, they have \nnot turned around weak performance in the sector. \n\nThe government is planning various measures to impose \ngreater discipline on the financial sector through amendments \nto the Bank Company Act of 1991, Bankruptcy Act of 1997, \nand Money Loan Court Act of 2003. It is planning as well a \nspecial audit for banks to probe irregularities in\u00a0the sector. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nBangladesh\u2002\u2002225\n\n3.15.4\u2002 Indicators of banking sector performance, FY2018 (%)\n\nBank type\n\nShare of assets\n\nGross nonperforming loan ratio\n\nProvision adequacy\n\nRatio of capital to risk-weighted assets\n\nReturn on assets\n\nReturn on equity\n\nNet interest margin\n\nRatio of expenditure to income\n\nSCB\n\n\u200226.1\n\n\u200228.2\n\n\u200264.1\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u2002\u20130.7\n\n\u201312.3\n\n\u2002\u20022.1\n\n\u200283.9\n\nDFI\n\n\u2002\u20022.4\n\n\u200221.7\n\n111.6\n\n\u201331.9\n\n\u2002\u20131.6\n\n\u2002\u20138.4\n\n\u2002\u20020.9\n\n149.9\n\nPCB\n\n\u200267.0\n\n\u2002\u20026.0\n\n103.2\n\n\u200212.2\n\n\u2002\u20020.6\n\n\u2002\u20028.2\n\n\u2002\u20023.5\n\n\u200278.4\n\nFCB\n\n\u2002\u20024.6\n\n\u2002\u20026.7\n\n104.3\n\n\u200223.0\n\n\u2002\u20022.8\n\n13.7\n\n\u2002\u20024.6\n\n44.3\n\nTotal\n\n100.0\n\n\u200210.4\n\n\u200284.9\n\n\u200210.0\n\n\u2002\u20020.3\n\n\u2002\u20024.4\n\n\u2002\u20023.2\n\n\u200280.3\n\nDFI = development financial institution, FCB = foreign commercial bank, PCB = domestic private commercial bank, \nSCB = state-owned commercial bank.\nSource: Bangladesh Bank. 2018.

When revising the \nBankruptcy\u00a0Act, it is important to ensure that it sets time-\nbound procedures for Money Loan Courts to speed up the \nresolution of cases being\u00a0settled.\n\nFurther, to improve governance, appointment to SCB \n\nboards of directors could be limited to competent professionals \nwho possess operational knowledge of banking and finance, \navoiding political appointments. Moreover, SCB management \nshould be given full operational independence to conduct \noperations day to day, with both the board and management \naccountable to the central bank.\n\nThe authorities should ensure strict enforcement of \nexisting\u00a0bank rules and regulations. They might consider \nconsolidation, merger, or divestment for SCBs, or even \nprivatization to reduce their number. Alternatively, \nrestructuring SCBs could be considered before divestment. \nThe authorities could also consider establishing a national \nasset management company to take over NPLs from ailing \nbanks. The government might decide to compensate SCBs \nin some efficient way or provide budgetary support for their \nmandated social services, such\u00a0as providing financial services \nto underserved areas of the economy.\n\n\fBhutan\n\nGrowth  slipped  for  a  second  year  running  as  construction  at  hydropower  projects  slowed \nand  low  water  temporarily  undermined  electric  power  generation.  Inflation  trended \ndownward  with  declines  in  import  prices,  and  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed  on \nstronger  exports.  The  outlook  is  for  growth  to  strengthen  moderately.  With  the  country\u2019s \nexpected  graduation  from  least-developed  status,  the  government  plans  reform  to \nstrengthen  domestic  resources  toward  better  funding  development. \n\nEconomic performance\nProvisional estimates indicate GDP growth in fiscal year \n2018 (FY2018, ended 30 June 2018) slowed further from \n6.3% in FY2017 to 5.5% on weaker performance in industry \n(Figure\u00a03.16.1). Construction remained an important driver of \ngrowth despite decelerating by nearly half from 9.8% expansion \nin FY2017 to 5.0%, mainly because of slower construction on \nhydropower projects. Moreover, hydropower generation, the \nother large component of industry, declined by 2.9% because \nof weak water flows. Services grew at a rapid 8.0% on robust \nexpansion in wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, \nand transportation and communications. Revenue from \ninternational tourism rose by 5.0%. Agriculture expanded \nby 4.5%, partly on greater access to credit under the priority \nsector lending policy adopted by the government in December \n2017, which requires banks to increase the share of credit \ngranted to qualifying loan proposals from cottage and small \nindustries, including agriculture. \n\nOn the demand side, capital formation increased \nonly marginally as construction slowed (Figure 3.16.2). \nGrowth\u00a0in\u00a0consumption expenditure was a major contributor \nto sustaining growth as private consumption markedly revived \nand government current spending remained robust. The trade \nand current account balances, though still in deficit, improved \nmarkedly again in FY2018, keeping net exports an important \ncontributor to growth. \n\nInflation moved lower throughout FY2018, the monthly \n\naverage falling from 4.3% the previous year to 3.6%. \nFood\u00a0inflation was elevated for much of the year as adverse \nweather hurt domestic supply and import restrictions limited \nimports from India, but food prices trended much lower starting \nin March 2018 (Figure 3.16.3).

Although gasoline and \ndiesel were not included in the GST, India waived central \ngovernment excise taxes on these products, which eased food \nand nonfood inflation alike. Improved access to housing loans \ncaused home rents to decline. From\u00a0the beginning of FY2019, \ninflation began to rise as the 1-year impact of the change to a \nGST faded, and it once again tended to track inflation in India \nand developments in domestic demand.\n\nMonetary policy remains oriented to maintaining price \nstability and supporting employment growth by channeling \ncredit to productive sectors of the economy. Broad money growth \nslowed to 10.4% in FY2018 with net foreign assets, a main driver, \ndeclining by 3.2% (Figure 3.16.4). Growth in domestic credit \nreflected mainly a 15.7% increase in credit to the private sector, \nmarginally higher than a year earlier. The\u00a0expansion in credit \nlargely benefited transportation, services, and housing, while \ncredit to manufacturing slowed. Credit to the government was \nslight as its budget deficit shrank to near balance.\n\nGovernment expenditure increased in FY2018 by 17.3% \nto reach 34.0% of GDP, providing a lift to domestic demand \n(Figure\u00a03.16.5). Current expenditure grew by 18.6%, mainly \non account of a higher bill for salaries and allowances, \nincrease in government staff, an electricity subsidy to \nlow-income consumers, and provisions for national elections. \nCapital\u00a0expenditure rose by 16.1% to complete projects under \nthe Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2013\u20132018. Government revenue \nincreased by about 27.8% in FY2018, three times average growth \nover the previous 5 years, driven by a 23.6% rise in tax revenue \non buoyant domestic demand while nontax and other revenue \nwas up by 39.2%. Grants also expanded markedly by 34.2%. \nOn\u00a0balance, the budget deficit declined from 3.4% of GDP in \nFY2017 to only 0.7%.\n\nThe current account deficit, though still high, continued \nto narrow in FY2018, falling by 5.0 percentage points to equal \n18.2% of GDP (Figure 3.16.6). Most of the improvement came \nin the trade account, with the bulk of that coming from a 7.6% \nincrease in exports as larger mineral exports overwhelmed the \nfall in electricity exports. Imports again declined, by 1.2% in \nFY2018 as construction slowed, but remained equal to nearly \n40% of GDP, reflecting the country\u2019s small manufacturing base. \nExternal debt rose from $2.5 billion in FY2017 to $2.6\u00a0billion \n\nas debt unconnected to hydropower rose with the drawing \ndown of about $100 million from a swap line with the Reserve \nBank of India to build up Indian rupee reserves (Figure 3.16.7). \nHydropower debt increased only\u00a0marginally.

Debt\u00a0servicing was less \nthan a quarter of export earnings. \n\nGross international reserves increased slightly by 0.6% \nto $1.1 billion in FY2018, providing cover for 13 months of \nmerchandise imports (Figure 3.16.8). Indian rupee reserves, \nwhich are the working balances for settling about 85% \nof import transactions, declined slightly from cover for \n4.4\u00a0months of imports to 3.3. \n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth will likely accelerate slightly to 5.7% in FY2019 with \nelectricity generation normalized in the rainy winter season \nand production higher at existing plants. Barring further delays \nto the commissioning of the Mangdechhu Hydropower Plant, \na full year of operation in FY2020 will help lift growth to \n6.0% in that year. Private spending is anticipated to strengthen \nfollowing parliamentary elections and the formation of a \nnew government in November 2018. Government spending \nis expected to see a major increase only in FY2020, however, \nafter the new government begins implementing programs \nand projects under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2018\u20132023. \nServices,\u00a0particularly wholesale and retail business and \ntourism, will continue to underpin the economy. After resolving \nexport clearance issues that prevented sales of certain crops \nto India for several months, agriculture is expected to grow \nmoderately with continued improvement in access to credit. \nInflation is forecast to increase to 3.8% in FY2019 and \nedge up further to 4.0% in FY2020 as the initial benefits from \nIndia\u2019s GST change taper and Indian inflation trends higher. \nPrices for export crops, particularly cardamom, will normalize \nfollowing the resolution of the export clearance issue. Lower \ninternational oil prices forecast for 2019 and 2020 will help \nkeep inflation at bay. Planned revisions to civil servant salaries \nand the minimum day wage will, once implemented, generate \nsome inflationary pressure.\n\nFollowing established practice in an election year, the \noutgoing government had Parliament pass an interim budget \nfor FY2019 that covered current expenditure for the year and \ncapital appropriations for ongoing projects but did fund any \nnew projects. As a result, capital expenditure in FY2019 is \nestimated to be about half that of FY2018. Government revenue \nis projected to drop by a third from a year earlier with the \ndiscontinuation of excise tax refunds from India under the \nGST, loss of revenue from a delay in commissioning of the \nMangdechhu plant, and grants expected to be only a third of \nthose a year earlier, mainly to support uncompleted projects. \nWith India\u2019s GST affecting the competitiveness of Bhutan \nexports, India has committed to a Nu4 billion grant over 5\u00a0years \n\n3.16.5\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nDomestic revenue\nRecurrent expenditure\nFiscal balance\nGrants\nCapital expenditure\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nBudget\n\nSource: National Budget Financial Year 2018/19.

Tax revenue, amounting to of 15.6% of GDP \nin FY2018, depends mainly on hydropower sales, which provide \n\n\f3.16.9\u2002Tax revenues, FY2018\n\nOther taxes\n16%\n\nCustoms duty\n3%\n\nGreen tax\n3%\n\nExcise duty\n18%\n\nCorporate\nincome tax\n33%\n\nBusiness \nincome tax\n6%\n\nPersonal\n income tax\n5%\n\nSales tax\n16%\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance, National Revenue Reports. \n\n3.16.10\u2002 Foregone revenue from \nfiscal\u00a0incentives\n\nDirect tax\nIndirect tax\n\nNu billion\n\nForegone taxes\n\n% of tax revenue\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance, National Revenue Reports. \n\n230(cid:4)(cid:4)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nthe bulk of corporate taxes (Figure 3.16.9). The ratio of tax to \nGDP is expected to decline for several years, however, owing to \nmajor delays in commissioning two large hydropower\u00a0projects.\nHydropower development entails large fiscal swings, from \n\nvery heavy expenses during construction to robust revenue \nflows upon commissioning. To accommodate such swings, a \nstabilization fund was established in November 2017 for setting \naside at least 5% of hydropower revenue annually to be used \nduring subsequent periods to smooth budgetary volatility and \nensure more even distribution of expenditure. The completion of \ntwo large hydropower projects after FY2020 promises to sharply \nboost export revenue and contributions to the fund.\n\nToward comprehensive reform of the tax system, a GST \nregime is being planned for adoption in 2020. It will replace all \nindirect taxes with a tax rate that is uniformly applied to goods \nand services, allowing only a limited list of exemptions and items \nbearing higher tax rates. A standard value-added tax system is \nbeing considered, with tax crediting for inputs and mandatory \nbusiness registration based on turnover. Such\u00a0reform\u00a0would \nbe a major step forward for Bhutan, as it is one of only six \neconomies in Asia and the Pacific that has not yet\u00a0adopted a \nvalue-added\u00a0tax. \n\nAlthough fiscal incentives may encourage investors and \n\nstimulate private sector growth, they have been costly for \nthe government. In 2017, foregone revenue amounted to \nabout 17% of\u00a0tax collected, mainly from indirect taxes, in \nparticular on sales\u00a0and from customs duty (Figure 3.16.10). \nThe Fiscal Incentives Act, 2017 removed from the Ministry of \nFinance the authority to grant exemptions and tax holidays, \nmaking them subject instead to parliamentary debate and \napproval. Parliament\u00a0would benefit from the establishment of \na technical\u00a0group to make assessments of requests to evaluate \ntheir net benefit to the country according to prescribed criteria. \nCounsel\u00a0from the group would inform parliamentary debate \nand\u00a0decisions on requests for tax incentives.\n\nThe large number of existing exemptions should be \n\nreduced to enable more revenue to be raised. Steering clear of \ntax holidays would likely be beneficial because, despite their \nease of implementation, they lack transparency and invite tax \navoidance. Removing tax holidays would not deter investors \nwho see solid business opportunities but would discourage the \nentry of footloose opportunists ready to exit the market when \nthe holiday\u00a0ends. Further, the provision and administration of \nincentives should be simplified without compromising investment. \n\nAs a complement to revenue reform, public financial \n\nmanagement needs further strengthening to ensure the proper \ncollection and administration of revenue. A fully electronic \nsystem for government payments is currently being rolled out. \nHowever, room exists to improve the quality of reporting by \nmaking it more frequent and informative. \n\n\fIndia\n\nGrowth  slowed  slightly  in  fiscal  2018  as  expansion  in  agriculture  and  services  slipped, \neven  though  industry  and  investment  strengthened.  The  current  account  deficit  widened \nbut  remained  modest,  while  inflation  continued  to  be  benign.  The  outlook  is  for  growth \nto  edge  up  on  strengthened  domestic  demand  and  bank  and  corporate  fundamentals. \nInflation and the current account deficit should remain tame.

The slowdown reflected subdued agriculture, \nwhich grew by only 2.7%, the lowest in 3 years. Food grain \nproduction was robust but slightly below the harvest in the \nprevious year, mainly with a shortfall in cereals and pulses. \nProduction from livestock rearing, fisheries, and forestry is \nestimated to have grown at a healthy rate.\n\nGrowth in industry sharply increased to 7.7% in FY2018, \n\nowing to strong manufacturing, construction, and utilities. \nManufacturing expanded by 8.1%, helped by strong expansion \nin corporate earnings. The index of industrial production \ngrew solidly, reflecting robust demand for capital equipment, \nconstruction goods, and consumer durables. Construction \nclocked robust growth at 8.9%, aided by government spending \non affordable housing and new infrastructure, especially roads. \nHowever, mining grew by a meager 1.2% as contraction in \ncrude oil and natural gas production offset strong growth in \nthe output of coal.\n\nServices slowed to 7.4%, their lowest growth rate in 7 years. \n\nGrowth in trade, hotels, transportation, and communication \nremained sluggish with only subdued growth in the freight \nand passengers carried by railways, and in cargo handled by \nships. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which account \nfor a large part of this sector, may have struggled to comply \nwith new regulations under the goods and services tax \n(GST), undermining the sector\u2019s performance. An uptick \nin credit and deposit growth helped financial, real estate, \n\nThis chapter was written by Abhijit Sen Gupta of the India Resident Mission, \nADB, New Delhi.\n\n\f232(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nand professional services grow at marginally higher rates \nthan in the previous\u00a0year, though stress on shadow banks \nlikely dented growth somewhat. Government steps to reduce \nGST rates for some real estate activities are thought to have \nprovided a boost to this industry. Finally, a government \nslowdown in current\u00a0spending slowed growth in government \nservices including public administration, defense, and the \n\u201cother\u00a0services\u201d category.\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption was the \nmain driver of growth in FY2018 (Figure 3.17.2). It grew by \n8.3%, the\u00a0highest rate in 7 years, despite rural consumption \nremaining sluggish under subdued crop prices, slow growth \nin rural wages, and stress on nonbank lenders. Consumption \nis likely to have received impetus from reduced GST rates \nacross a wide range of commodities during the year and a cut \nin key monetary policy rates. Government consumption slowed, \nas\u00a0expected, because of tightened finances.\n\nGross fixed capital formation grew by a robust 10% in \n\nFY2018 despite coming off a high base. It was sustained \nby growth in central government capital expenditure by a \nrobust 20.3% as investment in roads, railways, and urban \ninfrastructure remained strong. Private investment is \nestimated to have increased a bit, reflecting a pickup in lending \nto industry, an uptick in capacity utilization, and increased \nproduction of capital goods. \n\nHeadline retail inflation averaged 3.5%, the lowest since \n\na new metric was introduced in 2011. It declined steadily, \nespecially from the second quarter of FY2018 (Figure 3.17.3). \nThe headline number masks, however, a lot of heterogeneity. \nMuch of the decline can be explained by muted food prices, \nwhich occupy 46% of the consumer price basket, as their \naverage annual increase in FY2018 was only 0.7%. Prices for \nvegetables, sugar, and pulses fell significantly during the year \nas robust production created a supply glut, and as prices for \ncereals, fruit, milk products, and edible oil increased only \nmodestly. Slow growth in rural wages squelched purchasing \npower in rural areas, reducing demand for food and pushing \nfood inflation down further. \n\nBy contrast, core inflation remained elevated at 5.6% on \nprice increases for housing, education and recreation services, \nand health care. Fuel inflation also remained strong on account \nof both higher global oil prices and Indian rupee depreciation.\nMuted headline inflation prompted the Reserve Bank of \n\nIndia, the central bank, to reduce key policy rates by 75 basis \npoints in FY2018, taking the repo rate to 6.25% (Figure 3.17.4). \nThe most recent cut, in February 2019, was prompted by a drop \nin household inflation, a reduction in the output gap, and the \ngeneral assumption that fiscal deficit targets would be met. \nThe\u00a0central bank also indicated a change in monetary policy \naway from calibrated tightening, under which policy rates \n\n3.17.2\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nGross capital formation\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n12\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 31 March of the \nnext year. \nSources: Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation. http://www.mospi.nic.in; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 1 March 2019).\n\n3.17.3\u2002Inflation\n\nFood\nOther goods\nCore\nHeadline\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSources: CEIC data company (accessed 13 March 2019); \nADB estimates.\n\n3.17.4\u2002Policy interest rates\n\nReverse repo rate\nRepo rate\nMarginal standing facility rate\nInterbank call money rate\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n%\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSources: Bloomberg; CEIC Data Company \n(accessed\u00a08\u00a0March 2019).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002233\n\ncould be only raised or kept unchanged, to a neutral stance, \nallowing rates to be changed in either direction.\n\nGrowth in bank credit rose from 7.0% in FY2017 to 11.9% in \nFY2018 largely on higher credit to services and personal loans \n(Figure 3.17.5). Within the service sector, credit to nonbank \nfinancial companies enjoyed the biggest increase, aiming to \nrestore liquidity to this troubled business segment. Professional \nservices and wholesale trade also benefited. Credit to industry \ninched up a bit over FY2017. Credit to infrastructure has picked \nup over the past few months, albeit from a low base.\n\nInitial results are heartening, after various steps were taken \n\nto improve the health of the bank sector, including a review \nof stressed assets in 2015, the introduction of new guidelines \nfor resolving insolvency and bankruptcy in 2016, and the \nrecapitalization of selected banks. The share of nonperforming \nloans in all loans declined from 11.5% in March 2018 to \n10.8% in September 2018 (Figure 3.17.6). This first decline in \nnonperforming loans since 2016 was broad-based, with public, \nprivate, and foreign banks all experiencing declines.\n\nThe nonbank financial sector, which has played a vital role \n\nin meeting credit needs, has been under stress since a default \nby a large player. This likely tightened financial conditions, \nraising the cost of capital.\n\nThe government fell marginally short of its fiscal deficit \n\ntarget for FY2018, the deficit finally equaling 3.4% of GDP, \nabove the 3.3% target (Figure 3.17.7). One reason was the \nintroduction of an agricultural income support program under \nwhich small farmers received \u20b96,000 per year. The scheme \nwill be implemented retroactively from December 2018 and is \nexpected to cost the equivalent of 0.1% of GDP in FY2018.\nDirect tax revenue remained buoyant in FY2018 as \n\nimproved compliance boosted the collection of personal income \ntax and healthy earnings bolstered corporate tax collections. \nGST collection fell short of its target, mainly because tax \nrates on various commodities were reduced during the year. \nRevenue\u00a0growth from customs and excise taxes was flat for \ngoods that remain outside of the GST. Central\u00a0government \nrevenue received a fillip from strong growth in dividends \nfrom the central bank and receipts from charges for \ntelecommunication spectrum use. The government\u2019s \ndisinvestment targets are estimated to have been met for a \nsecond year in a row.\n\nCentral government capital expenditure grew by a robust \n\n20.3% in FY2018 on increased outlays for roads, railways, \nand defense. In addition, capital spending by public sector \nenterprises grew by 5.5%. Growth in current expenditure was \nmore modest at 13.9%. Apart from income support to small \nfarmers, other contributors to mounting current expenditure \nwere higher food subsidies, interest payments, and outlay on \npensions. \n\n3.17.5\u2002Bank credit\n\nAgriculture & allied activities\nIndustry\nServices\nPersonal loans\nTotal\n\n% change year on year\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n3.17.6\u2002Stressed loan ratio\n\nRestructured loans\nGross nonperforming loans\n\n% of loans\n\nMar\n2015\n\nMar\n2016\n\nMar\n2017\n\nMar\n2018\n\nSep\n2018\n\nSource: Reserve Bank of India (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n3.17.7\u2002Federal budget indicators\n\nTax\nNontax\nOther revenue\nCurrent expenditure\nCapital expenditure\nDe\ufb01cit\n\n% of GDP\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nRevised\n\n2019\nBudget\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 31 March of the \nnext year.\nSource: Ministry of Finance Union Budget 2016\u20132018. \nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in.\n\n\fAfter rebounding in FY2017, import growth slowed to 9.8% \n\n3.17.8\u2002Trade indicators\n\n234(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nin FY2018, reflecting sluggishness in imports other than oil \n(Figure 3.17.8). Growth in imports of capital goods declined in \nthe second half of FY2018 in line with weakening economic \nactivity. Gold imports contracted from the previous year, \npossibly indicating subdued rural demand. In contrast, higher \noil prices and domestic consumption propelled oil import \ngrowth by more than 32.0%. \n\nExports grew by 8.9%, slightly slower than in the \n\nprevious\u00a0year. Export growth was buoyed by strong growth \nfor refined petroleum exports, aided by the rise in global \nprices. Non-oil exports grew by a meager 6.0% despite a low \nbase. Healthy growth in exports of electronics, chemicals, \npharmaceuticals, machinery, and textiles was countered by \ncontraction in exports of metals and leather products.\n\nThe surplus in services grew by only 3.0% in FY2018 even \n\nthough software exports revived after 3 years of stagnation. \nExports of transportation, travel, and business services \nalso increased, though financial service exports dipped. \nRemittances grew robustly as higher oil prices boosted growth \nprospects in oil-producing countries, where many Indian \nmigrants work.

The central bank\u2019s index of consumer confidence \nreached in December 2018 its highest reading in nearly 2 years \n(Figure\u00a03.17.13).\n\nThe recent pickup in investment growth is expected \n\nto continue, albeit at a slow pace. The improvement in \nnonperforming loans held by banks, and the resulting \neasing of credit restrictions on certain banks, are expected \nto boost lending to industry. The central bank\u2019s industrial \noutlook survey showed business expectations in the last \nquarter of 2018 reaching their highest in more than 4 years \n(Figure\u00a03.17.14). Similarly, the share of respondents expecting \ncapacity utilization to improve in the coming quarters was the \nhighest in 6 years, which is likely to spur private investment. \nPublic sector capital formation is likely to be muted, with \ncapital expenditure by the central government and its public \nenterprises forecast to decline from an estimated 5.1% of GDP \nin FY2018 to 4.5% in FY2019. Any investment revival will be \ndampened a bit by a decline in new project announcements in \nFY2018, even as the number of stalled projects increased.\n\nCurrent weather points to a normal monsoon, suggesting \nhealthy growth in agriculture, helped by a low base in FY2018 \nand steps to improve agricultural productivity. \n\nSurveys provide a mixed outlook for manufacturing. \nThe Nikkei purchasing managers\u2019 index indicates steady \nimprovement in recent months for manufacturing, given strong \ngrowth in new orders (Figure 3.17.15). In contrast, a downward \ntrend in the Nomura composite leading index indicates some \nmoderation in growth outside of agriculture. Manufacturing \nis likely to benefit from lower borrowing costs and rising \ndemand for consumer goods, aided by government measures to \nboost disposable incomes. The purchasing managers\u2019 index for \nservices has inched up since from the middle of 2017, though \ndipping a bit in the most recent months. Moderating growth \nprospects in the advanced economies hurt tradeable services, \nthough this was mitigated by a more competitive currency. \n\nIn sum, growth is forecast to pick up modestly to 7.2% in \nFY2019 on revived rural consumption, continued growth in \nprivate investment in response to improved bank and corporate \nbalance sheets, more competitive domestic firms and products \nunder the GST, and less drag from net exports. Growth in \npublic investment is likely to be modest for lack of funds. \nGrowth is expected to edge up further to 7.3% in FY2020 on \ndividends reaped from recent reforms to improve the business \nclimate, strengthen banks, and alleviate agricultural distress.\n\nThe forecast has some downside risks.

On the domestic front, \ngrowth could suffer if tax revenue falls short or any disruption \naffects the ongoing resolution of the twin problems of bank and \ncorporate balance sheets.\n\nInflation, remaining largely benign in FY2018, is expected \n\nto inch up in FY2019. Food inflation is likely to experience \na mild uptick as some of the increase in procurement prices \npasses on to retail prices. Any increase in input costs such as \nwages and fertilizers could also push up food prices. Mistimed \nor misdirected rainfall could damage harvests and stoke food \ninflation. Average global oil prices are expected to be 13% lower \nin 2019 than last year. However, retail prices for deregulated \nfuels like gasoline and diesel are unlikely to decline by this \nmuch because the government is likely to raise taxes on them \nto boost revenue, as it has done in the past. Core inflation \nis expected to persist at current rates as proposed budget \nmeasures to raise disposable income would bolster aggregate \ndemand. The lagged impact of the recent depreciation of the \nrupee will force up prices for imported goods. In sum, inflation \nis likely to average 4.3% in FY2019, rising to 4.6% in FY2020 as \nmarket prices firm up and domestic demand strengthens.\n\nInflation below expectations in FY2018 opened some space \n\nfor monetary policy stimulus. With inflation expected to \naverage below 4.0% in the first half of FY2019, the central bank \ncould further lower policy rates. However, the extent of any \neasing would be restrained by fiscal concerns and the risk of \nstoking food inflation. \n\nThe central government put fiscal consolidation on hold in \nFY2019 by targeting a deficit equal to 3.4% of GDP, close to the \nFY2018 outcome, and higher than the earlier target of 3.1% of \nGDP. Part of the divergence was on account of the agricultural \nincome support scheme and tax relief to people earning up to \n\u20b9500,000. Central government tax revenue is forecast to grow \nby 14.9%, an ambitious follow-on from high 19.5% growth in \nFY2018. Improved compliance and measures to broaden the \ntax base will help personal income tax to grow, but the 17.2% \ngrowth target may be a bit ambitious given tax concessions \nin the budget. Similarly, the growth target of 18.2% in GST \nrevenue seems a bit optimistic. Nontax revenue is forecast to \ngrow by 11.2%, aided by strong growth in dividends from the \ncentral bank and other financial institutions. Divestiture and \nstrategic sales are expected to raise \u20b9900 billion, equal to 0.4% \nof GDP, which is ambitious but achievable.\n\nCurrent expenditure growth, forecast at 14.3%, is more \nthan growth in capital expenditure, which is budgeted at 6.2%. \nFurther, as in the previous years, a significant part of capital \nexpenditure will be undertaken by public enterprises, though \nas a percentage of GDP it is lower than in the previous year. \nHigher current expenditure is predicated on increased outlays \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002237\n\n3.17.15\u2002Purchasing managers\u2019 indexes\n\nManufacturing\nServices\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nNote: Nikkei, Markit.

Subsidies are budgeted 11.7% higher, \nprimarily to raise the cooking gas subsidy. Interest payments \nare also budgeted higher by 13.2%. \n\nExports of refined petroleum products are expected to \ngrow at a slower rate as oil prices dip and growth slows in the \nindustrial economies and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nPart of this will be offset by improved exports other than oil \nor gold, which will benefit from a more competitive currency. \nOverall merchandise exports in FY2019 are expected to grow \nby 8.0%, slightly slower than in FY2018. Import growth is \nalso expected to slow with lower oil prices and weakening \ncurrency. A revival in rural income could bolster gold imports. \nSimilarly,\u00a0an uptick in investment could draw in more imports \nof capital goods. On balance, import growth is expected to slow \nto 8.0% in FY2019. \n\nThe surplus in services could narrow a bit with weaker \ngrowth in the industrial economies.

On balance, the \ncurrent account deficit is expected to equal 2.4% of GDP in \nFY2019. \n\nRecent gains in the ease of doing business and a healthy \ngrowth outlook are likely to attract strong inflows of foreign \ndirect investment. Portfolio debt flows may weaken a bit \nwith policy rates lowered in FY2019, reducing the interest \nrate differential with industrial economies. Portfolio equity \nflows are expected to remain robust. Overall capital flows \nare expected to finance the current account deficit, though a \nshortfall may require a modest drawdown of reserves.\n\nIn FY2020, export growth is expected to remain modest \nat 7.0% as growth in the industrial economies slows further. \nStable oil prices will help moderate import growth, though \nnon-oil imports are likely to grow at a slightly faster pace as \ngrowth inches up. Overall import growth is projected to be \n8.0%. The current account deficit is forecast to widen slightly \nto the equivalent of 2.5% of GDP in FY2020.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014enhancing participation \nin global value chains\nIndia\u2019s merchandise exports have grown from $35.7 billion in \n2000 to $298 billion in 2017, at an average annual rate of 12.2%, \nnearly double growth in global exports.

Recently, policy\u00a0makers \nhave delineated numerous strategies to improve India\u2019s \nexport performance in strategy documents like Foreign Trade \nPolicy 2015\u201320, Strategy for New India @75, and Unlocking the \nPotential of Micro Small and Medium Enterprise\u00a0Exports.\n\nIndia could improve its export performance by enhancing \nits participation in global value chains (GVC), as GVC exports \naccount for more than 70% of global exports over the past 8 \nyears. India\u2019s GVC exports in 2017 came to only $241\u00a0billion \n(62.7% of overall exports), significantly below $1,314 billion \nfor the PRC, $577 billion for Japan, $533 billion for the \nRepublic\u00a0of Korea, $329 billion for Singapore, and $318 billion \nfor Taipei,China (Figure 3.17.16). Sectors that dominate \nIndia\u2019s GVC exports include coke and petroleum, chemicals, \nbasic\u00a0and fabricated metals, textiles, and electrical and \noptical\u00a0equipment.\n\nEconomies that have the highest increase in GVC \n\nparticipation, measured as the ratio of GVC exports \nto all exports, also experience the sharpest rise in all \nexports measured as a percentage of GDP (Figure 3.17.17). \nEnhanced\u00a0GVC participation is similarly associated with other \ndevelopment goals for India: a higher share for manufacturing \nin GDP, faster job creation, and faster economic growth.\nGVC participation benefits from low trade barriers. \nAs\u00a0GVCs depend on goods crossing international borders \nmultiple times, high trade costs from high tariffs or nontariff \nbarriers are passed on to the downstream firms, raising \nthe cost of the finished goods. This affects the production \nand investment decisions of firms involved in GVCs. \nAccording\u00a0to the Global Competitiveness Index compiled by \nthe World\u00a0Economic Forum, India\u2019s tariffs remain significantly \nhigher than average in emerging markets. Lowering them \nwould improve GVC participation. International trade costs \ndepend as well on the time and cost involved in complying \nwith customs and border procedures. Although India has \nmade substantial progress in this regard, as evidenced by a \nsharp improvement in recent years in its World Bank rank for \ntrading across borders, its rank at 80 out of 190 in 2018 shows \nthat there is still scope for improvement. Improvement in trade \nacross borders was one of the factors that helped India jump \n23\u00a0places to 77th position in overall ease of doing business.\n\nA country\u2019s ability to connect with GVCs depends crucially \n\non the quality of its infrastructure. One of the main reasons \nfor geographic fragmentation of production under GVCs is to \ntake advantage of varying production costs across countries \nand produce each component at its cheapest location. \nFirms\u2019 production costs depend crucially on the quality of \ninfrastructure. Poor electricity supply and frequent outages \nforce a firm to restart the assembly line to restore production, \nclean up and repair damage to facilities, and dispose of faulty \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002239\n\nproducts, all of which substantially raise costs and undermine \ncompetitiveness. Similarly, underdeveloped road and rail \ntransport infrastructure impedes connectivity between ports \nand production centers, slowing production and making it more \nexpensive. While India has substantially improved the quality \nof its roads, according to the Global Competitiveness Index, \nthe quality of its electricity supply trails that of other emerging \nmarkets. Sectors like electrical and optical equipment, \ntransport equipment and chemicals, and rubber and plastics \nhave the potential to be further integrated into GVCs if these \nimpediments are resolved.\n\nLimitations on the finance available for infrastructure \n\nargue for concentrating investments in industrial zones. \nInfrastructure can be developed within such zones with \ncosts shared by the firms present in them, reducing the \ninfrastructure investment required of individual firms. \nThese\u00a0zones can be strategically located near transport hubs \nand linked with ports and airports that have better road and \nrail infrastructure.\n\nFinally, skills development can help countries enhance \ntheir productivity gains from participation in GVCs. It allows \ncountries and industries to specialize in higher and medium \ntechnology production and in complex business services like \nchemicals, electrical and optical equipment, and finance and \ninsurance with potential to foster innovation and productivity \ngrowth. India faces a formidable challenge in this area, as \nonly an estimated 4.7% of its workforce has received formal \ntraining, much lower than in other large economies of Asia: \nJapan at 80%, the PRC at 24%, and the Republic of Korea at \n96%. To close this gap, policies on skills development need to \nbe designed to meet the requirements of both low- and high-\ntechnology manufacturing and complex services. It would be \nprudent to design policies that improve skills across different \nsegments of industries and not focus on too narrow a selection, \nto avoid misallocation. \n\n\fMaldives\n\nDespite  slippage  in  tourist  arrivals,  growth  strengthened  in  2018  on  higher  construction \nand services underpinned by greater government expenditure. The current account deficit \nremained large, and inflation trended sharply lower as food subsidies resumed. With slower \ngrowth in tourism markets, the outlook is for growth to moderate and the current account \ndeficit  to  stay  large.  A  rapid  buildup  of  government  debt  calls  for  careful  management  to \nkeep  the  economy  on  a  sustainable  growth  track. \n\nEconomic performance \nExpansion in tourism, construction, and supporting services \nboosted growth from 6.9% in 2017 to an estimated 7.6% in 2018, \ndespite bouts of political unrest that ended in September with \nthe election of a new president and government administration \n(Figure 3.18.1). \n\nGrowth in tourist arrivals slowed from 8.0% in 2017 to \n6.8% in 2018, reaching almost 1.5 million. Fewer scheduled \nflights from Asian markets were offset by new flights and \nhigher frequencies from Europe, bringing growth in arrivals \nfrom Europe to 12.4%, with that market accounting for 84.5% \nof the increase in arrivals and maintaining the largest market \nshare at 48.9%. Arrivals from Asia, the second largest market, \nfell by 1.0%, to a 39.2% market share, as arrivals from the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China declined by 7.6%, continuing a \npersistent trend as the market share of this single largest \nnational market fell from 30.2% in 2014 to 19.1% in 2018. \nMeanwhile, the share of all other Asian countries increased \nonly moderately over this period, from 17.0% to 20.1%. \n\ngrew by 10.3% as the average stay lengthened to 6.4 days \n(Figure 3.18.2). Moreover, growth in collections of goods and \nservices taxes on tourists accelerated to 11.4%, reflecting \nstrong\u00a0growth in income not only for the government but also \nfor resorts. \n\nConstruction growth remained robust in 2018, underpinned \n\nby credit growth and rising demand from infrastructure \nprojects both public and private. The Public Sector Investment \nProgram (PSIP) increased, with spending 20.3% higher than \nin 2017.

Notably, growth in \nimports of construction materials markedly accelerated from \n24.2% in 2017 to 37.7%.\n\nFish exports contracted by 10.2% on weak demand and \nlower global prices for skipjack and yellowfin tuna, the main \nexport species. Growth remained strong in other sectors \nsuch\u00a0as financial services, transportation and communications, \nand wholesale and retail trade.\n\nAverage inflation fell from 2.8% to 0.1% deflation in 2018 \n(Figure 3.18.3). This reflected government efforts starting in \nthe second quarter of 2017 to reduce food prices, which had \nballooned earlier after subsidies on staples were removed. \nThe measures included imposing price cuts and controls on \nmajor staples, cutting import duties on fuel to counter higher \nglobal prices, and setting lower prices for electricity and \ntransportation. In April 2018, the government harmonized \nutility rates across the country to the lower urban rate and \nfully reversed its earlier policy to remove subsidies, which \nessentially restored 2016 food prices. \n\nWith inflationary pressure low, the Maldives Monetary \nAuthority has maintained the accommodative policy in force \nsince it lowered the indicative monetary policy rate in 2014 and \nagain in 2015. In 2018, credit to the private sector increased \nby\u00a011.2%, mainly through large loans for tourism, construction, \nand real estate. \n\nSpending reprioritization helped to bring the budget deficit \ndown to 3.0% of GDP in 2017 from 9.9% in 2016 (Figure 3.18.4). \nFiscal policy for 2018 turned expansive with reacceleration of \nthe PSIP, which raised capital expenditure by 16.0%, and with \na new pay structure for civil servants that swelled recurrent \nspending by 14.8%. Total expenditure thus rose from 30.1% \nof GDP in 2017 to 31.3%. Revenue rose by 5.3% to equal 25.8% \nof GDP, though this reflected a weaker tax performance than \nin 2017 as collections of goods and services tax slumped and \ncapital revenue declined. Accordingly, the estimated budget \ndeficit climbed from 3.0% of GDP in 2017 to 5.5% in 2018, with \nfinancial data indicating a rather higher deficit in 2018 at 9.3% \nof GDP.\n\nGovernment external debt, including Rf10.5 billion in state \n\nloan guarantees, nearly doubled to Rf30.8 billion in 2018, or \nthe equivalent of 37.4% of GDP (Figure 3.18.5). State-owned \nenterprises\u2019 use of guarantees was the main factor pushing \ndebt higher. Government external debt increased, by 21.9% \nof GDP, mainly from the private placement in May 2018 of \na $100 million sovereign bond with a 5-year maturity and \na 5.5% coupon, and a $130 million increase in commercial \nbuyers credits.

Imports rose by 25.6% on increased demand for \nconstruction goods, machinery, and electrical equipment, while \nexports rose by only 0.1%, with fuel reexports offsetting the \ndrop in fish exports (Figure 3.18.6). The current account deficit \nwas amply financed by large net financial inflows of direct and \nportfolio investment, including the $100 million government \nbond placement, and a marked increase in inflows of other \ninvestment liabilities facilitated by state guarantees. \n\nA $100 million currency swap facility between the Maldives \n\nMonetary Authority and the Reserve Bank of India helped \ngross international reserves climb from $586.1 million in 2017 \nto $757.8 million.

The new government plans an aggressive \napproach to developing tourism that targets 2.5 million arrivals \nin 2023, or 1.0 million more than in 2018. An augmented \npromotional budget of $10 million for 2019 will fund intensified \nmarketing campaigns to further enhance Maldives\u2019 exposure \nin foreign markets. To extend tourism beyond several \nselected atolls to the whole country, the government plans to \ndevelop tourist destinations on each atoll and to prioritize the \ndevelopment of guesthouses.\n\nThe outlook for construction is positive. The new \ngovernment has pledged to continue the infrastructure \nprojects initiated by the previous administration and to start \nnew capital projects throughout the country. Although the \nPSIP allocation in the approved budget for 2019 is 2.0% lower \nthan a year ago, the budget targets larger PSIP financing \nin succeeding years. Toward increasing private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure projects, the government plans \nto set up the Government Fund Management Corporation, \nwhich will extend funding to facilitate national development \nprojects initiated by private firms.\n\nFiscal policy is slated to be slightly less expansionary \n\nin\u00a02019 as the government aims to increase revenue by \nabout 10% on higher tax collections and hold expenditure \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nMaldives\u2002\u2002243\n\n3.18.7\u2002Gross international reserves\n\nTotal\nUsable\n\n$ million\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\nTotal reserves\nimport cover\n\nUsable reserves\nimport cover\n\nMonths of imports\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2019. \nMonthly\u00a0Statistics.

The\u00a0deficit\u00a0is set to narrow to 4.4% of GDP in 2019, \nthough it could reach 5.5% with higher capital investment and \npressure to deliver on election pledges such as lower domestic \nairfares, lower electricity prices, and tuition-free higher \neducation in Maldives to the first degree earned.\n\nFisheries will get much-needed policy attention \n\nintended to increase output and earnings by developing fish \nproducts with high value added for premium markets and \nexpanding the capacity of Maldives Industrial Fisheries \nCompany, a state-owned processer and exporter of fish \nproducts. The\u00a0government\u00a0intends to explore the potential of \nmariculture,\u00a0aquaculture, and reef fishing.\n\nDespite good prospects domestically, signs of a global \n\neconomic slowdown in the next 2 years, especially in Maldives\u2019 \nmain tourist markets in Europe and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, will weigh on tourism and the economy. GDP growth is \nthus projected to moderate to 6.5% in 2019 and further to 6.3% \nin 2020.\n\nForecasts of subdued global prices for oil and food should \nkeep average inflation low. Also holding down price pressures \nwill be government policies to contain the prices of basic \ncommodities and several newly announced policies, notably \nremoving duty on farming and fishing equipment, tuition free \neducation, lower airfares and electricity prices, and harmonizing \nstaple food prices across the country by April\u00a02019. On balance, \ninflation is forecast at 1.0% in 2019, rising to 1.5% in 2020. \n\nThe high trade deficit will shrink slightly as large imports \n\nrequired to supply construction ease a bit on the projected \nmarginal cut in the infrastructure program, and as investments \nto lift fishing capacity enable fish exports to recover. Sustained \ngrowth in tourism will maintain the service surplus. On balance, \nthe current account deficit is expected to narrow to 21.8% of \nGDP in 2019 before widening again slightly to 22.0% in 2020 as \ncapital expenditure picks up. \n\nThreats to the outlook include the government\u2019s continuing \n\nunstable finances and the country\u2019s high ratio of debt to GDP \nand low foreign exchange reserves.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014managing the buildup  \nof public debt\nMaldives has increased its borrowing over the past few years to \nsupport a massive program to scale up infrastructure, and this \nhas fueled a rapid buildup in public debt.

Moreover, the introduction of a sovereign \nguarantee scheme in 2017 has bound the government to \nadditional debt obligations. Under the scheme, state-owned \nenterprises and private parties are both eligible for sovereign \nguarantees on projects that the government chooses to support, \nthough so far only one private party has received a guarantee.\nIn 2018, public debt including government-guaranteed \ndebt increased markedly by 30.4% to Rf59.5 billion, equal to \n72.1% of GDP (Figure 3.18.8). According to an International \nMonetary Fund Article IV mission statement in 2019, Maldives \nis at high risk of debt distress. A challenge to the country is \nto balance infrastructure development with long-term debt \nsustainability in light of limited repayment capacity. To remain \neligible for grants under the International Development \nAssociation, Maldives must comply with its Non-Concessional \nBorrowing Policy (NCBP). However, non-concessional loans \nto Maldives signed from 2015 to 2017 prompted the NCBP \ncommittee to find it in breach of this policy because a number \nof the loans did not meet the 35% minimum required for the \ngrant component. This prompted a change starting in 2018 \nfor allocations to Maldives to be half grant, half International \nDevelopment Association credit.\n\nThe new government intends to borrow on more \nconcessional terms in the future and has recently secured \n$1\u00a0billion in concessional financing from the Government \nof India, of which $50 million is grants, $150 million is \nconcessional budgetary assistance, and $800 million is a line \nof credit with the Export-Import Bank of India. Moreover, \nthe government plans to refinance high-cost debt with more \nconcessional financing and is currently looking for options to \ndo so. It has expressed its intention to renegotiate unfavorable \nloan and project agreements signed in recent years, and it is \nstrengthening the process it uses to issue sovereign guarantees. \nTo create a sufficient reserve buffer toward paying off external \ndebt, the government will continue building up its Sovereign \nDevelopment Fund. Meanwhile, it is requesting a waiver on \nthe NCBP change in its funding allocation as it seeks to comply \nwith the NCBP going forward.\n\nFiscal consolidation and proper debt management of \ngovernment and government-guaranteed debt are critical to \nlong-term fiscal and debt sustainability. This requires Maldives \nto prioritize capital expenditure in line with its National \nDevelopment Strategy, improve public finance management, \nand reform state-owned enterprises. Further, the government \nneeds to be mindful of the implications of it pledges and find \nways to restrain the fiscal deficit in the near term. External \npressures would be lower under more manageable fiscal \ndeficits in the near term than are projected in the baseline \nscenario of the fiscal framework.\n\n\fNepal\n\nThe  economy  remained  healthy  in  fiscal  2018,  though  growth  moderated.  The  outlook \nis  for  stable  growth  fueled  by  buoyant  domestic  demand  as  the  government  improves \ninfrastructure  and  the  investment  climate.  The  current  account  deficit  will  widen  on  an \nexpected increase in imports coupled with weak export competitiveness, building pressure \non external stability. The authorities can smooth the transition to federalism by developing \ninstitutional capacity, clarifying legislation, and ensuring sufficient resources to subnational \ngovernments. \n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth moderated to an estimated 6.3% in fiscal year \n2018 (FY2018, ended 16 July 2018) as economic activity \nrecovered and normalized after earlier devastating earthquakes \nand trade disruptions (Figure 3.19.1). A continued expansive \nfiscal policy underpinned robust domestic demand. This\u00a0kept \nindustry growth high at 8.8% as construction expanded \nby 10.6%, bolstered by government capital spending and \naccelerated earthquake reconstruction, and manufacturing \nexpanded by 8.0%, benefiting from more and better electricity \nsupply. Services, the largest sector, grew by 6.6% as tourism \nincreased and economic activity normalized. Floods early in \nthe year crimped rice production to limit growth in agriculture \nto only 2.8%. \n\nOn the demand side, high consumption expenditure \ninduced by faster growth in remittances dominated spending \nin FY2018. Fixed investment soared by 15.7% on higher private \ninvestment in manufacturing, energy, and tourism, to provide \nnearly one-third of GDP. Strong growth in construction \nspurred higher imports of building materials and capital goods, \nwidening the trade deficit and making net exports a drag on \ngrowth.\n\nInflation eased from 4.5% in FY2017 to average 4.2% in \nFY2018, mainly tracking subdued inflation in India, the main \nsource of supplies and to whose currency the Nepalese rupee \nis pegged (Figure 3.19.2). Despite a spike in domestic oil prices, \nthe supply of goods improved, inflation for health care and \neducation services moderated, and prices for clothing and \nfootwear and housing and utilities remained subdued.\n\n3.19.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nIndirect taxes less subsidies\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.9\n\n6.0\n\n6.3\n\n6.2\n\n6.3\n\n3.3\n\n0.6\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\n Forecast\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending in mid-July of that year.\nSources: Central Bureau of Statistics. 2018. \nNational\u00a0Accounts of Nepal 2017/18. http://cbs.gov.np/; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n3.19.2\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nOverall\nFood & beverages\nOther goods & services\n\n% change year on year\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\nThis chapter was written by Manbar Singh Khadka and Neelina Nakarmi \nof\u00a0the Nepal Resident Mission, ADB, Kathmandu.\n\nJul\n2015\n\nJul\n2016\n\nJul\n2017\n\nJul\n2018\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: Nepal Rastra Bank. 2019.

The fiscal deficit doubled \nfrom the equivalent of 3.2% of GDP in FY2017 to 6.7% in \nFY2018 (Figure 3.19.3). Capital expenditure rose by 28.0% with \nreform to budget implementation, and recurrent expenditure \nclimbed by 34.3% on transfers to subnational governments \n(SNGs) equal to about 8.0% of GDP, as well as election \nexpenses. Reflecting buoyant tax revenue from high import \ngrowth, revenue increased by 19.1% to equal 24.2% of GDP. \nBroad money (M2) supply increased by 19.4% in FY2018 \nas rising net domestic assets pushed growth in supply above \n15.5% in the previous year (Figure 3.19.4). Credit to the \nprivate sector grew by 22.3%, with a significant share going to \nwholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, and construction. \nNepal Rastra Bank, the central bank, sought to tighten credit \nby forcing banks to maintain their ratio of loans to core capital \nplus deposits at 80% and lowering the ratio of mortgages and \nconsumer loans to purchase value, which moderated lending \nfor real estate and vehicle purchases. \n\nContinued rapid growth in imports, particularly of \nconstruction materials and capital goods, reached 27.5% in \nFY2018, pushing the trade deficit to $10.9 billion and taking \nit as a percentage of GDP from 34.5% in FY2017 to 37.7%. \nDespite\u00a0healthy remittance growth at 10.5%, the current \naccount deficit ballooned from $95.4 million in FY2017 to \n$2.3\u00a0billion, equal to 8.2% of GDP (Figure 3.19.5). The deficit \nwas partly financed by government borrowing.\n\nFinancial inflows could not fully offset this deficit, so gross \n\nforeign exchange reserves fell slightly to $10.1 billion, still \nproviding 9.4 months of cover for imports of goods and services \n(Figure 3.19.6). The Nepalese rupee depreciated by 6.0% against \nthe US dollar in FY2018, in line with Indian rupee depreciation. \nIn real effective terms, the currency has been appreciating in \nrecent years, indicating erosion of export competitiveness, but \nthe trend reversed in FY2018 with slight depreciation.\n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic growth is anticipated marginally down in FY2019 \nat\u00a06.2%. A normal monsoon is expected to boost rice \nproduction to 5.5 million tons, for an 8.4% rise from a year \nearlier. The production of maize, the other important summer \ncrop, is projected to rise by only 1.8%. Winter rainfall has been \ntimely and will likely boost the production of cash crops like \npotatoes, vegetables, and fruit to boost agriculture growth \noverall to 4.5%.\n\nIndustry will likely grow by 7.1% in FY2019, buoyed by \n\nhigher expectations for political stability. With no major \nelectric power cuts since May 2018, more manufacturing \nfirms have launched operations, and capacity utilization has \n\n3.19.3\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nFiscal balance\nCapital expenditure\nRecurrent expenditure\nGrants\nDomestic revenue\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nBudget\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending in mid-July of that year.\nSource: Ministry of Finance.

Construction gained momentum \nin the first half of FY2019, to mid-January 2019, and will \ncontinue to do so in the whole year in light of development \nneeds, larger budget allocations made to SNGs, and accelerated \nreconstruction. Growth in services will edge up to 6.4% on \nexpansion in wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, \nand finance. \n\nGrowth in FY2019 will find support in private investment, \n\npublic infrastructure spending, and buoyant government \nrecurrent spending. Data for the first half of FY2019 show \ncapital expenditure up by 14.7% over the year-earlier period. \nSNG spending will similarly stimulate growth in FY2019. The \nbudget for the year envisages a deficit equal to 8.0% of GDP, \nbut it will likely be lower as capital expenditure underperforms \nallocation. Private consumption will likely remain strong with \nrobust growth in remittances (Figure 3.19.7). \n\nThe trade deficit will widen further in FY2019 as domestic \n\ndemand pushes up imports of oil and other products, and as \nthe economy continues to struggle with its low manufacturing \nbase and weak export competitiveness. The current account \ndeficit is projected to deepen from 8.2% in FY2018 to 9.3% with \nincreased imports of capital and consumer goods and services, \nand despite lower oil prices and healthy growth in remittances.\nAverage annual inflation will edge up from 4.2% in FY2018 \nto 4.4% in FY2019, having averaged 4.2% in the first 6 months \nof FY2019. Inflationary pressure will be kept largely in check \nby increased crop production, better supplies of goods and \nelectricity, subdued oil prices, and expected moderation of \ninflation in India.\n\nGDP growth is envisaged at 6.3% in FY2020, assuming \na normal monsoon and no untoward circumstances such as \nfloods devastating crops. Support for growth will come from \nthe ongoing mechanization of agriculture, efforts to accelerate \nthe implementation of large infrastructure projects, and the \nlikely implementation of proposed legal reform to promote \ninvestment. \n\nAverage annual inflation will stay moderate at 5.1% in \nFY2020, assuming a better harvest, subdued oil prices, and \nonly modestly higher inflation in India. The current account \ndeficit is expected to narrow to the equivalent of 8.1% of \nGDP as import growth moderates thanks to fuel imports \nfor generators replaced by better hydroelectricity supply. \nRemittances will continue to grow robustly. \n\nDownside risks to the FY2020 outlook center on the \nchallenges pertaining to the smooth implementation of fiscal \nfederalism.

The first year \nof the implementation of federalism yielded mixed results, full \nof challenges and learning experiences. While the Constitution \nbroadly specifies the rights and responsibilities of the three \ntiers, the smooth implementation of federalism stumbled over \nambiguities in enabling legislation and a lack of capacity and \nappropriate human resources and capacity in SNGs. \n\nThe central government found it a challenge to quickly \n\nrealign the existing national civil service with a federal \nsystem. A lack of requisite staff, both technical and \nadministrative, affected the delivery of services and project \nexecution. However, legislation passed in early 2019 set \nfavorable\u00a0promotion and pay grades for staffers who meet \nspecified criteria, encouraging thousands of civil servants \nto apply for transfer to SNG positions. Additional legislation \nnow in the works addresses other administrative staffing \nconstraints on SNGs.\n\nunits in four modes: fiscal equalization grants, conditional \ngrants, complementary grants, and special grants (Table 3.19.2). \nSNG budget execution in the first 6 months of FY2019 was low, \nmainly owing to a lack of staff capacity to carry out programs \nand project implementation.\n\nResponsibility for expenditure has been decentralized \n(Figure 3.19.8). However, revenue mobilization remains with \nthe national government, which collects the major revenue \nstreams like income tax, value-added tax, and customs and \nexcise duties to fund intergovernmental transfers to SNGs to \ncover their spending. Alternatively, though, local constituencies \nwould have more choice in prioritizing local government \nservices, and spending efficiency would likely improve, if SNGs \nhad their own clearly defined sources of revenue. \n\nEnsuring greater coordination among the tiers of \ngovernment is key to effective service delivery and project \nexecution, as are legislation and directives to further clarify \nthe mandates and responsibilities of the different tiers of \ngovernment. \n\nTo make expenditure more efficient, SNGs should augment \ntheir own revenue collection by improving taxpayer databases \nand accountability. The success of federalism hinges on \nmaintaining cooperation, transparency, accountability, and \nfiscal discipline at all three tiers of government.

Expansionary  fiscal  policy \nmarkedly  widened  the  budget  and  current  account  deficits  and  drained  foreign  exchange. \nUntil  macroeconomic  imbalances  are  alleviated,  the  outlook  is  for  slower  growth,  higher \ninflation,  pressure  on  the  currency,  and  heavy  external  financing  needed  to  maintain \neven  a  minimal  cushion  of  foreign  exchange  reserves.  Recurrent  crises  in  the  balance  of \npayments  require  that  firms  become  more  export  competitive. \n\nEconomic performance\nFor fiscal year 2018 (FY2018, ended 30 June 2018), the \nestimated GDP growth rate has been revised downward from \nearlier 5.8% to 5.2%. Growth therefore slowed from 5.4% a year \nearlier, with revisions indicating slowdowns in industry and \nservices (Figure 3.20.1). Lower growth in industry mirrored \nweaker growth in large-scale manufacturing, which is almost \nhalf of the sector, from 5.4% in FY2017 to 5.0%, as well as a \nslowdown in construction despite a strong revival in mining \nand quarrying. Growth in services decelerated from 6.5% in \nFY2017 to 5.8% last year. Growth in agriculture accelerated, \nby contrast, from 2.1% in FY2017 to 3.7% on an uptick in minor \ncrops and cotton ginning.\n\nOn the demand side, growth in private consumption\u2014which \nprovides on average 81% of GDP and was the largest contributor \nto growth in FY2018\u2014found support in low inflation and \ninterest rates. Fixed investment in FY2018 reflected higher \npublic investment in infrastructure and energy, especially \nunder the China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor\u00a0(CPEC) \nproject, including electric power projects. Meanwhile, private \ninvestment declined slightly despite low interest rates. \nNet\u00a0exports weighed on growth as imports grew considerably \nfaster than exports to meet rising demand for oil and capital \nproducts, notably to support infrastructure projects.\n\nAverage consumer price inflation decelerated from 4.2% \nin FY2017 to 3.9% as food inflation fell from 3.8% to 1.8%, and \ndespite other inflation accelerating from 4.4% to 5.4% on strong \ndomestic demand, rising global commodity prices, and a lagged \neffect of exchange rate adjustment (Figure 3.20.2). To counter \nrising inflation expectations, the State Bank of Pakistan, \nthe\u00a0central bank, gradually raised from January to May 2018 its \npolicy rate by 75 basis points to 6.50%. \n\nThis chapter was written by Guntur Sugiyarto and Farzana Noshab of the \nPakistan Resident Mission, ADB, Islamabad.\n\n3.20.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product at basic prices\n\nPercentage points\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.6\n\n5.4\n\n5.2\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: Ministry of Finance.

Revenue declined slightly \nfrom 15.4% of GDP in FY2017 to 15.2% last year, despite tax \nrevenues rising to equal 13.0% of GDP. Nontax revenues fell \nby 0.8 percentage points to 2.2% of GDP in FY2018 as receipts \nfrom the Coalition Support Fund declined and despite higher \ncentral\u00a0bank profits. Expenditure rose from 21.3% of GDP in \nFY2017 to 21.8% on higher interest payments, defense spending, \nand federal government subsidies, as well as a sizable increase \nin provincial current expenditure, which was expected \nin an election year. To contain the rising budget deficit, \ndevelopment\u00a0expenditure, equal to 5.3% of GDP in FY2017, \nwas\u00a0cut to 4.6%.\n\nGross public debt rose from the equivalent of 67.0% of \nGDP at the end of FY2017 to 72.5% a year later, above the 60% \nthreshold stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt \nLimitation Act (Figure 3.20.4). The fiscal deficit was financed \nlargely by borrowing from the central bank and external \nsources. Domestic borrowing for budgetary support was, \nat\u00a04.2% of GDP in FY2018, twice the amount borrowed from \nexternal sources. External financing comprised multilateral \nand bilateral loans, as well as inflows from the issuance of a \n$2.5\u00a0billion eurobond in November 2017. External public debt \nincluding liabilities increased by $9.2 billion to $75.4 billion in \nFY2018, rising from 21.7% of GDP in FY2017 to 26.6%. \n\nPrivate sector credit expanded by PRs775.5 billion, or\u00a014.9% \n\nin FY2018, as lower government borrowing from commercial \nbanks left more liquidity available to the private\u00a0sector \n(Figure\u00a03.20.5). This was despite credit to state-owned \nenterprises sustained at PRs254.7 billion, slightly above the \nFY2017 amount, reflecting their weak finances and need for \ncontinued government support.\n\nA large trade deficit drove the current account deficit to \n$19 billion, equal to 6.1% of GDP in FY2018 and significantly \nabove the 4.1% deficit a year earlier (Figure\u00a03.20.6). \nExports\u00a0rebounded from near stagnation at only 0.1% \ngrowth in FY2017 to 12.8% in FY2018 on rising exports of \ntextiles, chemicals, leather, and food\u2014and are benefiting \nfrom currency depreciation. Import growth slowed from \nthe equivalent of 18% of GDP in FY2017 but, at 15% in \nFY2018, still outpaced export growth on higher imports \nof metal, vehicles, machinery, and petroleum, Pakistan\u2019s \nmajor imported commodities.

In response to intensifying \ninflationary pressures, the central bank gradually raised, \nin\u00a0four rounds from July 2018 to January 2019, its policy rate \nby 375 basis points to 10.25%. Despite tighter monetary policy \nand lower international oil prices, inflation is expected to rise \nsharply to average 7.5% in FY2019, driven up by continued \nheavy government borrowing from the central bank, hikes \nto domestic gas and electricity tariffs, further increases in \nregulatory duties on luxury imports, and the lagged impact \nof currency depreciation by more than 10.7% since July 2018. \nInflation will remain elevated at 7.0% in FY2020.\n\nA supplementary consolidated government budget for \nFY2019, adopted in September 2018, envisages a decline in the \nbudget deficit to 5.1% of GDP in FY2019, mainly by cutting \ndevelopment expenditure excluding CPEC projects, but it also \nincluded measures to enhance revenue and extend relief to \nthe poor. Growth in tax collection weakened from a robust \n16.4% in the first half of FY2018 to only 2.7% a year later. \nThe\u00a0Federal Board of Revenue targets tax collection equal to \nonly 11.6% of GDP in FY2019, taking into account reduced sales \ntaxes on major petroleum products, drag on the collection of \nwithholding tax from contracts, contraction in general sales \ntax revenue as imports slow, and the overall slowdown in the \neconomy. Including nontax revenue, total revenue declined by \nnearly 2.4% in the first half of FY2019.\n\nBudget expenditure increased by 5.5% in the first half of \nFY2019 over the same period a year earlier as current spending \nrose for interest payments and defense. Lower revenue \ncollection and higher current expenditure pushed the budget \ndeficit from the equivalent of 2.3% of GDP in the first half \nof FY2018 to 2.7% a year later. This situation will make it a \nchallenge for the government to achieve the reduction in the \nbudget deficit it targets for FY2019. A second supplementary \nbudget, adopted on 6 March 2019 without information on \nthe projected deficit, focuses on an economic reform package \nenvisaging incentives and measures to encourage investment \nand exports, enhance the ease of doing business, and \nstrengthen export-oriented activities.\n\nIn the first 8 months of FY2019, the government borrowed \n\nmore from the central bank and less from commercial banks, \nfreeing up liquidity with which commercial banks boosted \ncredit to the private sector by 18.9% over the same period of \nFY2018. This sharply increased net domestic assets and nearly \ndoubled broad money growth to 2.8%.\n\nThe current account deficit is expected to ease in FY2019 \nbut will remain high at the equivalent of 5.0% of GDP because \nof the large trade deficit. It will narrow further to 3.0% in \nFY2020 with easing macroeconomic pressures on the external \naccounts. Export growth plunged from double digits in the \nfirst 7 months of FY2018 to 1.6% in the same period of FY2019. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nPakistan\u2002\u2002253\n\n3.20.10\u2002 Pakistan vs. South Asia:  \nGCI Scores 2018\n\n1: Institutions\n\n12: Innovation\n\n2: Infrastructure\n\nPakistan\nSouth Asia\n\n11: Business\nsophistication\n\n10: Market size\n\n9: Technological\nreadiness\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n3: Macroeconomic\nenvironment\n\n4: Health & primary \neducation\n\n5: Higher education\nand training\n\n8: Financial market\ndevelopment\n\n6: Goods market\nefficiency\n\n7: Labor market\nefficiency\n\nSource: Global Competitiveness Index 2017\u20132018, \nWorld\u00a0Economic Forum.\n\n3.20.11\u2002Share in total world exports\n\n2005\n2017\n\n%\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1.7\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndia\n\nViet Nam Pakistan\n\nSource: WTO Annual Reports. http://www.wto.org.\n\nIt\u00a0is expected, however, to strengthen in the remaining \nmonths of this fiscal year and further in FY2020 as the lagged \nimpact of currency depreciation kicks in, along with the \nincentive package for export-oriented industries announced \nin January\u00a02019. Imports fell by 0.8% in the first 7 months of \nFY2019 from the same period of FY2018, with imports other \nthan oil 5.7% lower because of slower domestic economic \nactivity, currency depreciation, and an increase in import \nduties for nonessential items.

It is classified as inhabiting the \nfirst stage of development among 35 factor-driven economies\u2014\nthat is, economies heavily reliant on unskilled labor and natural \nresources. The country\u2019s persistently low score and ranking on \nthe index is reflected in its companies\u2019 struggles to compete in \ninternational markets and in weak export opportunities, which \nspark recurring crises in the balance of payment. \n\nPakistan lags behind the South Asia regional average \n\non most index indicators (Figure 3.20.10). Business \ncompetitiveness in Pakistan suffers under a challenging \nmacroeconomic environment and adverse terms of trade, \nsignificantly eroding production and exports. Pakistan\u2019s \nexports, such as they are, remain largely primary products \nwhose lack of sophistication and diversification condemn \nthem to declining shares in world markets (Figure 3.20.11). \nAgricultural commodities, textiles, and other manufactures \nwith little value added comprise over 80% of exports.\n\n\f254(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nThe high cost of doing business is a key factor limiting \n\nfirms\u2019 ability to compete. Access to affordable capital is \nconstrained by a shallow and underdeveloped capital market. \nManufacturing firms face high corporate tax rates, taxes on \ndividends and retained earnings, cascading taxes levied on \nintercorporate dividends, and a super tax levied on retained \nreserves. The effective corporate tax rate of up to 49% is \nsignificantly higher than taxes on international competitors. \nHigh custom duties on machinery imports raise the cost of \ninvestment, and high tariffs on raw materials and intermediate \ninputs erode the price competitiveness of both exporters and \ndomestic industries facing stiff competition from imports. \nSimilarly, high tariffs and undependable electric power add to \nproduction costs.\n\nPakistan\u2019s cumbersome customs and clearance procedures, \nand the poor quality of its logistics and infrastructure, remain \nconstraints on its capacity for just-in-time supply chain \nmanagement. Investing in infrastructure and improving \ntrade facilitation could boost participation in world markets, \nbut the absence of industry-wide facilities to test and certify \ncompliance would still leave many exporters disadvantaged.\n\nMacroeconomic stability is needed to create an \n\nenvironment that inspires business confidence and is conducive \nto investment and trade. Facing twin deficits in fiscal and \ncurrent accounts, the government has long been bedeviled \nby difficult policy choices that pit improved tax revenues \nagainst enhanced competitiveness. Moreover, with an anti-\nexport bias in tax and exchange rate policies, and high \ngovernment borrowing that crowds out private investment, \nfirm competitiveness erodes even though recent currency \ndepreciation supports exports.\n\nThe government is currently preparing its 5-year Strategic \n\nTrade Policy Framework with the objective of boosting \nexport competitiveness. All elements of a competitiveness \nframework are under consideration, including measures \ntaken at the border and others behind it. The framework will \naddress issues that hinder not only export competitiveness \nbut also the creation of a more competitive domestic industry. \nAs\u00a0a\u00a0first\u00a0step, the Prime Minister announced in March\u00a02019 \na more liberal e-visa policy for foreign visitors from 175 \ncountries. \n\n\fSri Lanka\n\nDespite  recovery  in  agriculture  and  improved  services  performance,  growth  remained \nsubdued  in  2018  as  industry  slowed.  Inflation  softened  as  food  inflation  eased,  but  core \ninflation picked up. Fiscal and structural reforms continued and remain critical to averting \nrepeated  macroeconomic  stress.  Growth  is  projected  to  recover  moderately  in  2019  and \n2020,  but  with  a  downside  risk  stemming  from  upcoming  elections.

Political \nuncertainties in 2018 weighed on economic sentiment \nand worsened in the last quarter, affecting Sri Lanka\u2019s \nrisk perception and prompting all three major agencies to \ndowngrade its rating.\n\nOn the supply side, a turnaround in agriculture and a \npickup in services supported growth. However, growth was \nheld back by a slowdown in industry with contraction in \nconstruction and weaker manufacturing.\n\nAgriculture grew by 4.8% in 2018 as rice production \nincreased by 33.9%, reversing sharp contraction in 2017, and \nproduction expanded as well for a number of other crops. \nHowever, a dip in tea production by 0.8% following excessive \nrain and lackluster performance of fisheries, both sizeable \ncontributors to agriculture, slowed the sector\u2019s recovery. \nAs growth in fixed investment slipped lower in 2018, \nconstruction shrank by 2.1%, pulling down industry growth \nfrom 4.1% in 2017 to 0.9%. Manufacturing growth remained \nmoderate at 3.0% despite a turnaround in food and beverages, \nthe largest category. Other important areas such as garments, \nrubber products, basic metals, and nonmetallic mineral \nproducts slowed, while some others contracted. Services grew \nby 4.7%, with finance expanding by 11.8% and wholesale and \nretail trade up by 5.0%. Transportation, the largest service \nindustry, continued to be weak, growing by only 2.8%. \nPublic\u00a0administration shrank by 0.6%.\n\nOn the demand side, consumption expenditure remained \n\nsubdued and dropped to 1.6% growth as government \nconsumption contracted for the second straight year. \nPrivate\u00a0consumption growth slowed to 2.3% from 2.5% in 2017. \n\nThis chapter was written by Nimali Hasitha Wickremasinghe and Savindi\u00a0Jayakody \nof\u00a0the Sri Lanka Resident Mission, ADB, Colombo.\n\n\f256(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nGross\u00a0fixed capital formation experienced a marginal decline in \nthe face of fiscal consolidation and political uncertainty, while \n29.6% expansion in inventories meant growth in gross capital \nformation (Figure 3.21.2).\n\nHeadline inflation, driven by food price deflation with \nrecovery in agriculture, trended lower in 2018 to average 2.1% \nfor the year (Figure 3.21.3). Headline inflation decelerated \nduring 2018 from 5.4% year on year in January 2018 to 0.1% \nin October and then picked up to 2.4% in February 2019. \nAverage\u00a0food prices fell by 0.2% in 2018, while nonfood inflation \naveraged 4.1%. Nonfood inflation trended higher from 2.5% year \non year in January 2018 to 6.7% in February\u00a02019, while core \ninflation was broadly stable in the first half of 2018 but picked \nup in the second half and reached 5.5% year on year in February \n2019. These movements reflect currency depreciation and the \npass-through of fuel prices to production\u00a0costs. \n\nRevenue collection, mostly of domestic indirect taxes, \n\nimproved by 4.8% in 2018 over 2017, but the ratio of \nrevenue to GDP still declined, to 13.4% (Figure 3.21.4). \nExpenditure\u00a0increased by 4.7% on higher current expenditure, \nwith interest payments increasing by 15.8%, while public \ninvestments declined by 4.9%. A primary surplus, equal to 0.6% \nof GDP, was recorded for a second consecutive year in 2018 as \nfiscal adjustment continued under an International Monetary \nFund (IMF) program, but the budget deficit for 2018, estimated \nat 5.3% of GDP, missed the 4.8% target. As the Sri Lanka \nrupee sharply depreciated, the ratio of central government \ndebt to GDP spiked, from an estimated 76.9% in 2017 to a \nprovisional 84.0% in 2018, illustrating the need to sustain \nfiscal\u00a0consolidation (Figure 3.21.5). \n\nAs inflation eased and growth slowed, the Central Bank of \nSri Lanka lowered its standing lending facility rate by 25 basis \npoints in April 2018 to 8.50%, leaving the standing deposit \nfacility rate unchanged at 7.25% (Figure 3.21.6). In response \nto liquidity constraints, and with call rates hovering near the \nupper end of the policy rate corridor, the central bank reduced \nthe statutory reserve ratio in November 2018 by 1.5 percentage \npoints to 6.0% to bolster liquidity, and at the same time it \nincreased the standing deposit facility rate by 75 basis points to \n8.0% and the standing lending facility rate by 50 basis points to \n9.0% to neutralize any potential effect on inflation from excess \nliquidity. Despite increased lending rates, credit to the private \nsector accelerated marginally after September (Figure 3.21.7). \nThe central bank further lowered the statutory reserve ratio \nto 5.0% in February 2019 to address liquidity deficits, while \nleaving policy rates unchanged.\n\nExport earnings expanded by 4.7% in 2018 as industrial \nexports grew by 8.4% and agricultural exports fell by 6.8% \nwith declines across all major agriculture export categories. \nGarment export growth accelerated moderately from 3.0% \n\n3.21.2\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nConsumption\nFixed investment\nChange in stocks\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka. \nhttp://www.statistics.gov.lk (accessed 19 March 2019); \nADB estimates.\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n3.21.3\u2002Inflation\n\nFood\nOther goods\nHeadline\nCore\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nFeb\n2019\n\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka. \nhttp://www.statistics.gov.lk (accessed 19 March 2019).\n\n3.21.4\u2002Government finance\n\nRevenue including grants\nRecurrent expenditure\nPublic investment\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nBudget\n\nNote: Figures exclude revenue and expenditure transfers \nto provincial councils.\nSources: Central Bank Annual Report various years, \nMinistry of Finance; ADB estimates.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nSri Lanka\u2002\u2002257\n\nin 2017 to 4.7%, while tea exports reversed 20.5% growth in \n2017 to contract by 6.6% with both lower volume and lower \nprices. Imports expanded by 6.0%, driven by large increases \nfor vehicles, fertilizer, and fuel, causing the trade deficit to \nwiden even as rice imports shrank on recovery in agriculture \nand gold imports declined following the imposition of customs \nduty. Motor vehicle imports increased sharply in the first 9 \nmonths but showed declines month on month in the last 2 \nmonths of 2018. This followed the imposition of import controls \nin September 2018 that included a 200% cash margin on letters \nof credit for motor vehicles, suspension of vehicle imports by \nall state institutions for 1 year, and disallowing government \nemployees concessionary duty rates on car imports for 6\u00a0months.\n\nA decline in outmigration since 2015 meant a second \n\nconsecutive year of lower worker remittances, falling by 2.1% in \n2018 (Figure 3.21.8). Earnings from tourism increased by 11.6% in \n2018 to reach $4.4 billion as tourist arrivals increased by 10.3% to \nreach 2.3 million. With service account and income net outflows, \nthe current account deficit widened from the equivalent of 2.6% \nof GDP in 2017 to an estimated 3.0% in 2018 (Figure\u00a03.21.9).\nCapital outflows brought the rupee under significant \n\npressure in 2018, causing it to depreciate against the \nUS\u00a0dollar by 19.6% year on year to the end of December\u00a02018 \n(Figure\u00a03.21.10).

However, \nin\u00a0Sri\u00a0Lanka, the pressure on the currency continued as a \npolitical\u00a0crisis unfolded in the last quarter.\n\nForeign currency reserves rose from $8.0 billion at the \nend of December 2017, or cover for 4.6 months of imports, \nto an all-time high of $9.9 billion in April 2018 as Sri Lanka \nsuccessfully raised $2.5 billion in international markets. \nBy the\u00a0end of December 2018, reserves had fallen again \nto $6.9\u00a0billion, or 3.7 months of imports (Figure 3.21.11). \nA\u00a0month\u00a0later, reserves had fallen further to $6.2 billion after \nthe government repaid debt using $1.0 billion from its reserves. \nAs\u00a0the political crisis reached resolution and discussions with \nthe IMF restarted, pressure on the rupee eased. \n\nThe government continued a raft of reforms in 2018: \n\nopening the Single Window Investment Facilitation Taskforce, \na web portal to streamline and fast-track investment approval; \nsetting\u00a0up as a one-stop shop and portal with trade information \nfor exporters and importers; and simplifying business procedures \nto obtain online construction permits, as well as property \nregistration and other information.

Having normalized in 2018, agriculture is expected \nto continue to grow at about the same rate in the next 2 years, \nassuming normal weather. Tea and marine fishing, both large \ncontributors to agriculture, will turn around in 2019 from \nthe dip experienced in 2018. Industry will pick up gradually \nover the 2-year period, reversing the slowdown in 2018. \nConstruction\u00a0is expected to reverse contraction last year with \nmarginal growth this year thanks to a base effect but also a \nhigher budget for public investment. Services will continue \nmoderate growth at 4.6% in 2019, picking up marginally to \n4.8% in 2020 with support from trade and financial services, \nas\u00a0well\u00a0as from accommodation and food and beverage services, \nwhich will benefit from continued expansion in tourism. \n\nOn the demand side, the 2019 budget includes proposals to \n\nincrease public sector salaries and allowances and to address \npension anomalies. This will support private expenditure and \nthereby growth. The government continues to consolidate \nits finances, but the primary surplus target of 1.5% in 2019 \nis downgraded from the original target of 2.0%. This may \nprovide an impetus to public investment as the 2019 budget \nincludes several capital expenditure projects. Uncertainties \nsurrounding an upcoming election will affect private investor \nsentiment. The Colombo Port City Project is expected to bring \nin new investment, but the pace may depend on the passage of \nsupporting laws.\n\nHeadline inflation is expected to be higher coming off a \nlow base in 2018 and fueled by rising economic activity in 2019 \nand\u00a02020. Food inflation, which slowed throughout 2018 and was \nnegative toward the end of 2018, will pick up from the low\u00a0base. \nA weak currency will exert upward pressure on prices and may \noffset anticipated lower fuel prices. Inflation\u00a0is\u00a0expected to edge \nup to 3.5% in 2019 and then reach 4.0% in 2020.\n\nAgriculture exports will turn around from contraction in \n2018 with improved performance from tea exports.

Expenditure \nis budgeted to increase marginally to equal 19.5% of GDP with \npublic investment increasing to 4.8% of GDP. The budget deficit \nis projected to fall to 3.5% of GDP in 2020. The primary surplus \nis targeted to increase progressively to 1.5% of GDP in 2019 and \n2.4% in 2020. From an election year perspective, the budget \nwas a positive development, signaling commitment to restoring \nfiscal order. To support export growth, the budget announced \naccelerated reduction in the cess on intermediate goods used in \nkey sectors. To encourage women to participate in the labor force, \ncorporate tax deductions were announced for companies that \ngrant 3\u20134 months of maternity leave.\n\nIn February 2019, the IMF completed its fifth review of the \nprogram, and a staff-level agreement was reached to extend the \nprogram for an additional year until June 2020. This will allow \nmore time for the government to complete the economic reform \nagenda.\n\ndebt may affect market sentiment and exert pressure on \nthe rupee. In January 2019, Sri Lanka entered into a swap \narrangement worth $400 million with India through the \nSouth\u00a0Asian Association for Regional Cooperation swap \nfacility. Soon after the conclusion of the IMF review and the \npresentation of the 2019 budget, Sri Lanka issued a 5-year \n$1.0\u00a0billion bond and a 10-year $1.4 billion bond, both of which \nwere oversubscribed. Together, these measures promise to \nshore\u00a0up reserves and support the currency.\n\nDownside risks to the forecast emanate from political \ndevelopments connected to elections and the ensuing policy \ndirection, as well as weather uncertainties.

With\u00a0two \n\nrice cultivation cycles disrupted since 2016, agricultural GDP \ncontracted by 3.7% in 2016 and 0.4% in 2017, domestic food \nprices surged by 14.4% in December 2017, and food imports \nincreased in 2017 by about 13%, or $214 million, to equal \n0.2% of GDP. The extended dry spell in 2016 affected large \nswathes of land across the country, reducing yields and causing \nother crop losses. The\u00a0drought forced power generation to \nshift from hydro to more expensive thermal production, \nraising oil imports by 40%, or $950\u00a0million, equal to 1.1% \nof\u00a0GDP. Government spending to repair the damage wrought \nby disasters amounted to 3% of government expenditure in \n2016, or 0.4% of GDP, and 2% of expenditure in 2017, or 0.5% \nof GDP. The cost of damage caused by disasters in 2016 and \n2017 was more than twice as high in rupee terms as the worst \ndisaster years in the past (Figure\u00a03.21.12). Disasters were felt \ndisproportionately by the poor, upending the livelihoods of \nmore than 2 million people. Rising food prices and falling \nproduction can deny food to the most vulnerable households, \naggravating the malnutrition prevalent in hazard-prone areas \nas the poor limit the number and size of meals they consume \neach day. They may cope by prioritizing feeding their children, \nlimiting expenditures on education and health care. Financial \ninstruments to mitigate the impact of weather-related hazards, \nsuch as insurance, are not readily available for the vulnerable, \nincluding women.\n\nQuick government action through higher imports, \n\npublic\u00a0food distribution, and increased fiscal spending on an \nexpanded social safety net mitigated the hardship inflicted on \nthe disaster-struck poor.

It is important to prevent \ndisasters and mitigate the consequences of those that occur \nthrough risk-informed investment planning and effective risk \nmanagement enabled by timely financing. \n\nThe economic consequences of recent disasters would \n\nnot have been as bad as they were if the economy had been \nrobust in general and more diversified in terms of employment. \nRecurrent weather-related disasters may threaten significant \ngains in poverty reduction made over the past 20 years. Further \nefforts to reduce poverty will be sustainable over the longer \nterm only if they successfully incorporate disaster risk reduction \nand climate change adaptation into development planning. \n\nThe focus needs to shift to areas prone to disaster and to \ndetermining how to make people, assets, and infrastructure \nmore resilient. Measures to mitigate disasters include \nformulating risk management action plans and early warning \nsystems, especially localized warnings to vulnerable \ncommunities, through community-based disaster risk \nmanagement, holding community education sessions and \nemergency drills, and assembling evacuation plans and kits. \nReliable risk profiles and timely hydrometeorological data and \ninformation on disasters are core inputs for many disaster \nrisk management initiatives. This requires effective capacity \nbuilding in data-generating agencies and a comprehensive \nmechanism for sharing data and information among all users.\n\nMajor efforts need to be mounted to mobilize funds for risk \nreduction and adaptation, establish correct policy frameworks, \nand build institutional capacity. Beyond the near term is a need \nto develop a comprehensive disaster risk financing strategy \nthat is consistent with debt sustainability. It should use a \nrisk-layering approach to promote the use of instruments to \nretain and transfer risk, as well as build up infrastructure and \nimplementation capacity.\n\n\f\fSOUTHEAST ASIA\n\nBRUNEI DARUSSALAM\u2002\u2022\n\nLAO PEOPLE\u2019S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\u2002\u2022\n\nCAMBODIA\u2002\u2022\n\nINDONESIA\u2002\u2022\n\nMALAYSIA\u2002\u2022\n\nMYANMAR\u2002\u2022\n\nPHILIPPINES\u2002\u2022\n\nSINGAPORE\u2002\u2022\n\nTHAILAND\u2002\u2022\n\nVIET NAM\u2002\u2022\n\n\f\fBrunei Darussalam\n\nEven  as  oil  prices  rose  in  2018,  this  energy  exporter  saw  oil  and  gas  production  decline \nbecause  of  unplanned  repairs  and  maintenance.

With  global \ndemand for energy increasingly favoring renewables, this hydrocarbon-dependent economy \nshould  exploit  its  solar  potential.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP is estimated to have contracted by 1.0% in 2018, reversing \n1.3% growth in the previous year (Figure 3.22.1). Oil and \ngas output, accounting for close to two-thirds of GDP, likely \ncontracted. Crude oil production fell by 1.5%, while the \nproduction of natural gas and liquefied natural gas each shrank \nby more than 3.0%. The rest of the economy contracted as well, \nby 0.8%, in the 3 quarters of 2018 for which data are available. \n\nOn the demand side, lower exports and domestic \n\nconsumption drove down GDP growth, more than offsetting a \nstrong rise in domestic investment (Figure 3.22.2). The decline \nin oil and gas production dragged volume growth in exports of \ngoods and services to less than 1.0% in the first 3 quarters of \n2018. Domestic consumption contracted by 0.4% as government \nconsumption declined by 1.3%. Meanwhile, domestic \ninvestment rose by a whopping 23.1%, largely reflecting \ncontinued work on the Hengyi refinery, the Temburong Bridge, \nand a fertilizer plant for Brunei Fertilizer Industries. \n\nEven as GDP contracted, the deflationary trend of the \nprevious 4 years reversed because of higher global commodity \nprices and depreciation of the Brunei dollar against the \nUS\u00a0dollar. Consumer prices rose by 0.1% last year, with prices \nfor food and beverages, hotels and restaurants, education and \nhealth care services posting modest increases (Figure 3.22.3). \nThe rise in international oil prices meant that, despite \n\nnear stagnation in the volume of exports, the US dollar \nvalue of merchandise exports rose by a solid 17.8% in 2018 \n(Figure\u00a03.22.4).

Monetary policy \ncontinued to focus on maintaining exchange rate parity with \nthe Singapore dollar. Broad money (M2) grew by 2.8% in \ncalendar 2018, while credit to the private sector contracted \nby\u00a02.9%.\n\nEconomic prospects\nHopes for growth in the near term are tempered by a \nweakening external environment and lower prospects for \ninternational oil prices. A modest boost to energy production \nis likely, though, with the start of downstream production \nat the new Hengyi refinery. Further, construction on the \nBrunei\u00a0Fertilizer Industries plant and the $1.3 billion \nTemburong Bridge is expected to stimulate growth until \nscheduled completion near the end of 2019. The economy \nis thus expected to return to growth, with GDP expansion \nforecast at 1.0% this year and 1.5% in 2020. \n\nNet exports will continue to drag on the economy as an \n\nexpected increase in the volume of exports will be more \nthan offset by higher imports to supply investment projects. \nLast\u00a0year\u2019s decline in domestic consumption may begin to \nreverse, however, and domestic investment may continue \nto grow, especially in construction as various economic \ndiversification projects proceed and as the government \nstreamlines regulations and procedures toward improving the \nbusiness environment (Figure 3.22.5). An anticipated increase \nin oil and gas revenue should enable higher government \nconsumption but will be tempered by government efforts to \nconsolidate its finances. \n\nInflation is expected to edge up as the economy \n\nimproves but only minimally, to 0.2% in both years, as global \ncommodity\u00a0prices stay subdued, the government continues to \nsubsidize consumer needs including fuel, and the Brunei dollar \nremains stable.\n\nExport earnings will be constrained by lower international \n\noil prices even as the import bill keeps rising in tandem with \ndomestic investment that will require higher imports of \nconstruction materials, machinery, and equipment.

A critical domestic risk would be \npossible failure of the government to sustain the timely \nimplementation of domestic investment projects.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014exploiting solar  \nenergy potential\nBrunei Darussalam has substantial reserves of oil and gas that \nwill last for decades (Figure 3.22.6). However, the composition \nof global demand for energy is expected to shift significantly \naway from conventional nonrenewable sources toward \nrenewable ones. The International Energy Agency predicted \nin 2018 that growth in global demand for oil and gas would \nslow as energy users sought other sources. The Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations now aims to source 23% of its \nprimary energy from renewable sources by 2025. For its part, \nBrunei\u00a0Darussalam aims by 2035 to reduce its energy intensity \nby 45% and, by the same deadline, increase the share of \nrenewables in electric power generation to at least 10.0%.\n\nMost electricity in Brunei Darussalam currently comes \nfrom oil and gas. The sole solar energy plant, Tenaga Suria \nBrunei, produces 1,700 megawatt-hours of solar energy \nper\u00a0year, or 0.05% of domestic electricity supply. A recent study \nestimated that from January 2011 to August 2017 the plant \nsaved the government $1.7 million and reduced carbon dioxide \nemissions by 8,000 tons. Given the proven value of solar \nplants such as this and the improving affordability of solar \npanels, solar power has significant potential as an additional \nsource of energy, even in a country as rich in hydrocarbons as \nBrunei\u00a0Darussalam.\n\nIn 2014, the Energy Department\u2014since reorganized as \nthe Ministry of Energy, Manpower, and Industry\u2014published \nits Energy White Paper, which outlines several initiatives \nto develop renewable energy. Progress on these initiatives \nhas been slow, however, with no regulatory framework or \nrenewable energy policy yet formulated. Work is not yet \ncomplete on a program to apply a feed-in tariff, which has \nencouraged the use of solar power globally by allowing users of \nrenewable energy to sell energy back to the electric utility. \nMuch remains to be done toward educating the public \non the benefits of solar power. One way to do this would be \nto introduce small standalone solar systems to replace the \nnoisy, polluting generators used to power lights and fans in \nnight markets. More broadly, the government should support \nresearch and development on ways to reduce the cost of \nsolar\u00a0energy.\n\n\fCambodia\n\nAccelerating  exports,  tourism,  and  investment  fueled  strong  GDP  growth  in  2018. \nInflation  nevertheless  slowed.  The  current  account  deficit  widened,  but  rising  foreign \ndirect  investment  drove  currency  reserves  higher.  A  weaker  external  environment  will \nlikely  soften  growth  this  year  and  next,  with  inflation  remaining  subdued  and  the  current \naccount deficit narrowing. A skills gap must be closed to extend high GDP growth beyond \nCambodia\u2019s  waning  phase  of  cheap  labor  before  its  demographic  dividend  expires.\n\nEconomic performance\nEconomic expansion last year hit 7.3% on a hefty increase in \nexports, buoyant tourism, and continuing strong foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) inflows (Figure 3.23.1). Growth in the dollar \nvalue of exports of goods and services rose from 10.7% in\u00a02017 \nto an estimated 18.3% in 2018. The value of merchandise \nexports alone jumped by the same estimated 18.3%, almost \ndoubling a 9.3% rise in 2017. International tourist arrivals \nrose by 10.7%, with those from the People\u2019s Republic of China \nbuilding on a 45.9% increase in 2017 with a further 70.0% surge \nlast year (Figure 3.23.2). Growth in FDI inflows edged up from \n12.6% in 2017 to an estimated 13.0%. \n\nBy sector, agriculture likely grew by 1.8%, and growth in \nindustry accelerated to an estimated 10.8%, up by more than \na percentage point from 2017 thanks to impressive growth \nin garments and footwear. Construction was also brisk, with \ngrowth rising from 18.0% in 2017 to 19.0%. Services maintained \ngrowth at 6.9%. \n\nEven as growth accelerated, inflation slowed from 2.9% \nin 2017 to 2.5% last year. Stable food prices and government \nmeasures to contain fuel price increases tamped down \ninflation, as did appreciation of the Cambodian riel along with \nthe US dollar, which is widely used in Cambodia for all but the \nsmallest purchases. \n\nStronger growth was accompanied by a widening of \nthe current account deficit as growth in imports outpaced \nthat of exports. Growth in merchandise imports more than \ndoubled in dollar terms from 9.8% in 2017 to an estimated \n20.0% last year, driven largely by rising imports of materials \nand components for export-oriented garment and footwear \nproduction and higher imports of construction materials. \n\nThis chapter was written by Poullang Doung of the Cambodia Resident Mission, \nADB, Phnom Penh.\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3.23.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nTaxes on products less subsidies & FISM\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.1\n\n7.0\n\n6.9\n\n7.0\n\n7.3\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nEstimate\n\nFISIM = financial intermediation services indirectly \nmeasured.\nSources: National Institute of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\n3.23.2\u2002Tourist arrivals by region\n\nAsia\nEurope\nAmericas\nAfrica\nMiddle East\n\nMillion\n\n7.0\n\n6.1\n\n5.0\n\nGrowth\n\n11.8\n\n10.7\n\n%\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: Ministry of Tourism, ADB estimates. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nCambodia\u2002\u2002269\n\n3.23.3\u2002Current account balance\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n3.23.4\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nExpenditure\nRevenue\nDe\ufb01cit\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n-12\n\n-16\n\n% of GDP\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\nTarget\n\nSource: Ministry of Economy and Finance.\n\n3.23.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n\u2002\u20027.0\n\n\u2002\u20022.5\n\n\u201312.7\n\n2020\n\n\u2002\u20026.8\n\n\u2002\u20022.5\n\n\u201311.8\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nThe current\u00a0account\u00a0deficit excluding official transfers likely \nwidened from the equivalent of 10.5% of GDP in 2017 to 13.6% \n(Figure 3.23.3).\n\nContinued strength in FDI inflows more than offset the \ncurrent account deficit, enabling gross foreign exchange reserves \nto rise to about $10 billion at the end of 2018, or cover for \n5.6\u00a0months of imports. Reserves exceeded external public\u00a0debt.\nBased on the government\u2019s table of financial operations, \nthe\u00a02018 budget was expansionary, with a deficit equal to 5.1% \nof GDP, somewhat higher than a 3.1% budget deficit realized \nin\u00a02017 (Figure\u00a03.23.4). Expenditure was budgeted to equal \n22.9% of GDP and revenue 17.8%. By December, though, actual \nrevenue had exceeded the budget target, but expenditure \nseemed\u00a0to have\u00a0lagged. \n\nMonetary policy continued to be anchored on maintaining \na stable exchange rate between the riel and the US dollar and \non ensuring that ample credit availability continued to support \ngrowth. Credit to the private sector grew by 23.2% in 2018, \nnudging up the ratio of private sector credit to GDP to 83.3% \nby\u00a0year-end.\n\nEconomic prospects \nA growth slowdown that is now forecast for the advanced \neconomies and the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2014major destinations \nfor Cambodian exports\u2014will likely soften prospects for growth \nin exports and tourism arrivals. GDP growth is thus seen to \nmoderate to 7.0% this year and 6.8% in\u00a02020 (Figure\u00a03.23.5).\n\nBy sector, industry and construction are expected to feel the \nadverse effects of the weakening external environment the most. \nGrowth in industry is likely to slow to 10.1% in 2019 and 9.4% \nin\u00a02020, and construction to 17.0% this year and 16.0% next year. \nGrowth in services will slow but only marginally to 6.8% in 2019, \nas will growth in agriculture to 1.7%. \n\nWith slowing growth, lower international oil prices, and \nstable food prices, inflation should remain subdued, the average \nstaying at 2.5% both this year and next. \n\nModerating growth and subdued inflation should narrow \nthe country\u2019s current account deficit, as shown in particular \nby imports of raw materials for export production. The current \naccount deficit is seen narrowing to the equivalent of 12.7% \nof GDP this year and 11.8% next year. Robust FDI inflows \nshould more than offset the current account deficit, pushing \ngross international reserves to $12 billion in 2019, or cover for \nabout 6 months of imports\u2014and, again, more than external \ndebt. The\u00a0ratio of external debt to GDP should thus remain at a \nsustainable 30.0%.\n\nWith growth softening, fiscal policy is targeting a \nnarrower budget deficit this year, equal to 4.5% of GDP, \naccording to the government\u2019s table of financial operations. \n\n\f270(cid:1)(cid:1)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n3.23.5\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\nMonetary\u00a0policy\u00a0will\u00a0continue to maintain the value of the riel \nagainst the dollar. The\u00a0government aims to gradually wean \nthe economy of dollarization with greater use of the riel and \nis slowly but steadily pushing banks\u2019 prudential norms toward \ninternational benchmarks.\n\nA key external risk to the outlook would be a global \neconomic slowdown steeper than currently anticipated. \nAnother\u00a0is the European Union carrying through with its \nplan to suspend trade preferences for Cambodia under the \nEverything But Arms program that it extends to least-developed \ncountries.

Reflecting this, the World Bank Human \nCapital Index 2018\u2014a composite measure of enrollment and \ndropout rates, average number of years of schooling, and \nlearning quality while in school\u2014ranks Cambodia just above \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, among \nits peers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \nbut its index score of 0.49 falls far short of Viet Nam\u2019s 0.67 \n(Figure\u00a03.23.6). A\u00a0worsening mismatch between the skills \ndemanded by industry and business and those imparted to \nyouth in school, including in institutions that specialize in \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET), is the \nmost important factor causing this skills gap. Unless it can be \nclosed expeditiously, Cambodia will squander the demographic \ndividend it enjoys in having a young and expanding workforce. \nThe government recognizes the urgency of closing the \nskills gap. It recently announced its National TVET Policy, \n2017\u20132025, which focuses on forging much closer collaboration \nbetween educational institutions and private businesses. \nThis collaboration promises to make education more market \ndriven. Regular information flows between private firms \nand TVET institutions, and collaboration in developing and \noperationalizing TVET curricula, promise to ensure that the \nskills imparted align with those in demand. To help keep \nstudents in school and learning the skills needed for the \ndigital\u00a0age, Cambodia needs more and better teachers and \nfinancial support for poor children and outstanding students.\n\nSIN\n\nVIE\n\nMAL\n\nTHA\n\nPHI\n\nINO\n\nCAM\n\nMYA\n\nLAO\n\n0.88\n\n0.67\n\n0.62\n\n0.60\n\n0.55\n\n0.54\n\n0.49\n\n0.47\n\n0.45\n\nIndex\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nCAM = Cambodia, INO = Indonesia, LAO = Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, MAL = Malaysia, MYA = Myanmar, \nPHI = Philippines, SIN = Singapore, THA = Thailand, \nVIE\u00a0=\u00a0Viet Nam.\nSource: World Bank. https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/\ndataset/human-capital-index (accessed 13 March 2019). \n\n\fIndonesia\n\nGrowth  edged  up  last  year  on  stronger  domestic  investment  and  consumption.  Inflation \nwas  lower,  but  the  current  account  deficit  widened  under  higher  imports  for  large \ninfrastructure projects. As it strengthens further, domestic demand should counter weaker \nexports  to  sustain  growth  in  the  near  term,  with  inflation  and  the  current  account  little \nchanged.  Harnessing  technology,  as  called  for  in  the  recently  announced  Indonesia  4.0 \ndevelopment  strategy,  is  key  to  realizing  national  growth  potential. \n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth accelerated marginally from 5.1% in 2017 to \n5.2% last year. Stronger domestic investment and robust \ndomestic consumption more than offset weaker export \ngrowth, enabling the economy to grow at its fastest pace \nsince\u00a02013 (Figure\u00a03.24.1). While exports of goods and services \nexpanded more slowly than in 2017, down from 8.9% to 6.5% \nlast year, fixed investment increased from 6.2% in 2017 to \n6.7% (Figure\u00a03.24.2). Strong investment was driven largely by \npublic infrastructure projects in transportation and energy. \nPrivate\u00a0investment into plantation agriculture recovered \nsomewhat after slower growth in 2017, in response to the \ngovernment\u2019s Biodiesel 20 program, which requires all diesel \nvehicles and heavy machinery to use blends that are at least \n20% biofuel.\n\nMeanwhile, domestic consumption improved slightly \n\non growth in 2017 at about 5%, helped by higher public \nconsumption, sustained momentum in private spending, \nand low and stable inflation. A continuing rise in household \nincomes thanks to a robust increase in formal employment \nunderpinned growth in private consumption and a decline in \nthe incidence of poverty to single digits, at 9.7% in September. \nLast year saw continued improvement in household welfare, \nas\u00a0evidenced by gains in access to better-quality housing. \nGrowth last year spanned economic sectors. While \nagriculture maintained its 2017 growth rate, industry and \nservices improved upon theirs (Figure 3.24.3). Industry\u00a0growth \naccelerated from 4.1% in 2017 to 4.3%, and services edged up \nfrom 5.7% growth in 2017 to 5.8%. Within industry, mining \noutput rose from 0.7% expansion in 2017 to 2.2% last year as \ngrowth in manufacturing remained steady at 4.3% and growth \nin construction moderated from 6.8% in 2017 to 6.1%.\n\n3.24.1\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nGross \ufb01xed capital formation\nChange in stocks\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n5.0\n\n4.9\n\n5.0\n\n5.1\n\n5.2\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n3.24.2\u2002 Contributions to fixed \n\ninvestment\u00a0growth\n\nBuildings and structures\nMachine and equipment\nVehicles\nCultivated biological resources\nIntellectual property products\nOther equipment\nGross \ufb01xed capital formation\n\nPercentage points\n\n4.4 \n\n5.0 \n\n4.5 \n\n6.2 \n\n6.7 \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\nThis chapter was written by Emma Allen and Priasto Aji of the Indonesia \nResident Mission, ADB, Jakarta.\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n\f272(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nMining benefited from a sustained rise in coal prices along \nwith increases in production quotas and 2017 policies to allow \nmore metal ore exports. Manufacturing growth was buoyed by \nstronger exports of manufactures such as apparel and footwear, \nas well as higher production of food and beverages mostly for \ndomestic consumption. Strong expansion in information and \ncommunication technology\u2014and in transport and storage, \nwhich grew by 7.0%\u2014underpinned expansion in services, the \nsector supplying roughly half of GDP growth last year.\n\nEven as growth edged up, inflation moderated from an \n\naverage of 3.8% in 2017 to 3.2% with ample food supplies \nowing to sustained agricultural production, deft food supply \nmanagement, limited pass-through from currency depreciation, \nand fuel and electricity prices kept stable by government \nsubsidies (Figure 3.24.4). Core inflation remained subdued as \nmonetary policy steadily tightened. Average inflation hovered \naround the lower end of the 2.5%\u20134.5% target range set by \nBank Indonesia, the central bank.\n\nStrong domestic demand saw merchandise imports expand \nlast year by 20.7% in US dollar terms, up from 16.2% growth in \n2017, while growth in the dollar value of merchandise exports \nslowed from 16.9% in 2017 to 7.0%. The trade balance thus \ndeclined from a surplus of $18.8 billion in 2017 to a small deficit \nof $0.4 billion (Figure 3.24.5). Improvement in net service \nexports\u2014driven by rising tourism revenues, telecommunication \nservice receipts, and remittances from workers overseas\u2014\npartly offset the deterioration in the trade balance. The current \naccount deficit rose from the equivalent of 1.6% of GDP in 2017 \nto 3.0% last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the surplus in the financial account narrowed. \n\nAlthough portfolio investment recovered ground in the \nlast quarter of 2018, the year as a whole witnessed higher \noutflows as the US Federal Reserve raised its federal funds \nrate. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) similarly weakened \nas Indonesians invested more abroad. The overall balance \nof payments thus fell into a deficit of $7.1 billion, causing \nforeign exchange reserves to slip from an all-time high of \n$132.0\u00a0billion in January 2018 to $120.7 billion by the end \nof the year (Figure\u00a03.24.6). Reserves were still sufficient to \ncover 6.5\u00a0months of imports and repayment of government \nexternal\u00a0debt. \n\nPressure on the balance of payments and foreign currency \nreserves saw the Indonesian rupiah depreciate by 5.7% in the \ncourse of 2018. It fell to a low of Rp15,253 to the US dollar on \n11\u00a0October and recovered to Rp14,481 by the end of the year \n(Figure 3.24.7). In response to currency depreciation, the \ncentral bank raised its policy interest rate, the 7-day reverse \nrepo rate, five times last year by a total of 175 basis points, \ntaking the rate to 6.00% by the end of the year. \n\n3.24.3\u2002 Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nManufacturing\nServices\nOther industry\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n3.24.4\u2002 Inflation\n\nOverall\nCore\nAdministered goods\nVolatile goods\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n3.24.5\u2002Current account components\n\nMerchandise trade\nService trade\nPrimary income\nSecondary income\nCurrent account balance\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n$ billion\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n-30\n\n-45\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nIndonesia\u2002\u2002273\n\nMeanwhile, the fiscal deficit as a share of GDP narrowed \n\n3.24.6\u2002Balance of payments\n\nCapital and \ufb01nancial account\n\nCurrent account\nNet errors and ommissions\n\nOverall balance\n\nfrom 2.5% in 2017 to an estimated 1.7% last year, the lowest \nsince 2011. Fiscal deficit reduction was achieved last year by \nboth raising revenue and containing expenditure growth. \nRevenue was equal to 13.2% of GDP, surpassing the original \nbudget target, while expenditure was contained at 14.9%. \nRevenue was boosted by previous gains from the tax amnesty \nprogram and higher commodity prices.

GDP growth is thus \nseen being sustained at 5.2% this year and edging up to 5.3% \nin\u00a02020.\n\nWith key public infrastructure projects such as the \nTrans-Java Toll Road now approaching completion, strong \nfoundations are laid for private investment. In addition, \nrecent reforms to improve the business environment, such\u00a0as \nstreamlining tax administration and simplifying business \nlicensing, should give a fillip to private investment. Coupled \nwith these reforms, improved macroeconomic management \nsaw the three major international credit rating agencies \nupgrade Indonesia\u2019s sovereign credit rating to investment \ngrade in 2017 and reaffirm that higher rating last year. Positive \ninvestor sentiment is reflected in steady improvement in the \namount of new capital raised and in the number of companies \nlisted (Figure 3.24.8). Recent initiatives to strengthen \nshareholder protection should further boost private investment. \nPrivate consumption should remain robust in the near term \n\nas formal employment continues to expand, the government \nscales up its social assistance programs, and inflation remains \nmodest. In the first half of 2019, consumption is likely to get \nan additional boost from spending in the run-up to a national \nelection in April. Yet another boost to private consumption \nis likely from sustained improvement in household access to \ncredit, as evidenced by a near quadrupling in the percentage of \nhouseholds that report having business loans from 8.2% in 2014 \nto 28.7% in 2018 (Figure 3.24.9). \n\nGrowth this year and next is likely to span sectors, with \n\nagriculture, industry, and services all forecast to sustain \n2018 growth rates in 2019 and agriculture and industry to \naccelerate in 2020. Continued strength in footwear and apparel \nmanufacturing is expected yield robust industrial growth in \n2019 and 2020.

The service sector is similarly likely to \nmaintain last year\u2019s growth pace, with strong performances \nfrom wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and \ninformation and communications. Transportation and storage \nwill benefit from improved transport logistics, customs \nregulations, and warehousing.\n\nWith growth sustained this year and edging up next year, \ninflation is similarly likely to remain unchanged at 3.2% this \nyear and edge up to 3.3% in 2020, in both years near the middle \nof the central bank target range of 2.5%\u20134.5%. As international \noil prices decline, the government is unlikely to change \nadministered prices of domestic fuel. A new pricing formula for \nunsubsidized fuels is expected to keep prices contained. \n\nMerchandise exports are expected to grow more slowly \nin US dollar terms as economic growth in Indonesia\u2019s trading \npartners weakens and as international commodity prices \nsubside for coal, rubber, and palm oil. At the same time, import \ngrowth will be lower as well as global oil prices soften and \ndemand for capital goods ease with the completion of large \ninfrastructure projects. Growth in imports will likely continue \nto outpace that of exports. Net service receipts should grow \nrobustly, however, as gains from tourism revenue look set \nto continue. The current account deficit is thus expected to \nnarrow to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP both this year and \nnext.\n\nImprovement in portfolio investment seen in the last \nquarter of 2018 is expected to continue. FDI should remain \nrobust with manufacturing again, as last year, receiving a \ndominant share of inflows, followed by trade. In addition, \ninvestors have already provided Indonesian startups with \nfresh capital injections this year. The government recognizes \nthe need to attract more FDI by improving the business \nand investment climate, and thereby improve the balance of \npayments.\n\nFiscal policy is likely to remain supportive. The 2019 \nbudget sets a fiscal deficit equal to 1.8% of GDP, as in 2018. \nPublic infrastructure spending is higher at 17% of total \nexpenditure and is more focused on investments with high \nreturns. Additional allocations have been made for disaster risk \nmanagement and mitigation. The budget prioritizes making \nconditional cash transfers to poor and vulnerable households \nin the countryside more effective. Depending on how the \nmacroeconomic situation unfolds in the near term, the central \nbank may adjust policy to sustain steady growth, keep inflation \nlow, and maintain a stable exchange rate.\n\nRisks to the outlook tilt downwards. Any escalation of \n\ncurrent trade tensions between the US and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China is a major external risk.

Preparing for \ndisruption: Technological Readiness Ranking.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014harnessing new \ntechnologies to accelerate growth \nEstimates of Indonesia\u2019s potential GDP growth rate in \n2020\u20132024 range from 5.5% to 6.3%. For the country to \nbring actual growth more in line with potential growth, \nmanufacturing has to expand to create more and better \njobs. However, any transformation of the manufacturing \nsector in Indonesia faces a key constraint: More than 99% of \nmanufacturing firms are micro and small enterprises (MSEs) \n(Figure 3.24.11). Such firms suffer low productivity and have \nlittle capability to expand and adopt emerging technologies. \nGiven MSE predominance in manufacturing, the sector \n\nmakes very little use of the digital technologies\u2014cloud \ncomputing, big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, \nand the internet of things\u2014that enable manufacturers \nelsewhere to streamline logistics, develop new products \nquickly, and grow. Global technological rankings for 2018\u20132022 \ncompiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit place Indonesia \nnear the bottom among Asian economies for technological \nreadiness, reflecting limited internet access and the low \nquality of digital services (Figure 3.24.12). In a similar vein, \nthe World\u00a0Economic Forum ranks Indonesia behind many \nother countries in the region in its Readiness for the Future of \nProduction Report 2018.\n\nEncouragingly, the government, recognizing the \n\nconstraints that hamper faster adoption of new technologies \nin manufacturing, recently announced a medium- to \nlong-term development strategy called Making Indonesia 4.0. \nAbbreviated as I.4.0, the strategy focuses on technology and \nproductivity upgrades in five manufacturing subsectors: food \nand beverages, textiles and garments, automobiles, electronics, \nand chemicals. To ramp up performance in these subsectors, \n10 priority areas that cut across them are identified: improving \nupstream capabilities, optimizing industrial zones, embracing \nsustainability, empowering small enterprises, building digital \ninfrastructure, improving human capital, adopting technology, \nattracting FDI, establishing an innovation ecosystem, and \nensuring policy coherence. \n\nI.4.0 is an ambitious strategy for faster and more efficient \n\nindustrialization. However, as is common with ambitious \ndevelopment strategies, it announces long-term goals but is \nshort on implementation details. In particular, I.4.0 does not \narticulate how the government will address the intertwined \nproblems of MSE predominance and the low use of new \n\n\f276(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\ntechnologies in manufacturing. For I.4.0 to make headway \nin achieving its goals, it would be useful to develop a policy \nroadmap, in consultation with industry and business to ease \nthese twin constraints.\n\nThe policy roadmap should focus on, among other things, \nhow to help MSEs grow and expand so they can reap benefits \nof scale when adopting new technologies. It needs to pay \nspecial attention to improving MSE access to finance, investing \nin digital infrastructure, and enhancing technology diffusion \nacross firms. One in four manufacturing MSEs in Indonesia \ncites inadequate finance as the main constraint on expansion. \nPolicies to ease this constraint could aim to lower the cost of \nfinance and simplify the cumbersome procedures required of \nbusinesses for obtaining bank loans. \n\nTo enable businesses to take advantage of the opportunities \n\noffered by new technologies, higher investment in digital \ninfrastructure is crucial. Public efforts are needed as well \nto adopt advanced technology offered by foreign firms \nand to foster indigenous innovation. This may require the \nestablishment of knowledge forums at which foreign and local \ncompanies exchange information and experiences, as well as \nforums at which domestic firms raise their awareness of the \nbenefits of the technologies emerging.\n\n\fLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n\nThe economy slowed last year as floods suppressed growth in agriculture and decelerating \ngrowth  in  electricity  generation  dragged  down  industry  growth.  GDP  growth  should  hold \nup this year and next as agriculture and electricity generation recover. Inflation is likely to \naccelerate  a  little  but  remain  modest,  and  the  current  account  deficit  is  forecast  to  ease. \nSubstantial  public  finance  reform  is  needed  to  rein  in  stubborn  fiscal  deficits  and  rapidly \nrising  public  debt. \n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth slowed from 6.9% in 2017 to 6.5% last year \nas severe floods hit agriculture and slower hydropower \ngeneration drove down industrial growth (Figure 3.25.1). \nGrowth\u00a0in\u00a0agriculture and allied activities, comprising 15% of \nthe economy, slowed from 2.9% in 2017 to 2.0% as production \nwas disrupted by floods in August and September 2018.\nEven as construction maintained rapid growth and \n\nmining climbed almost completely out of contraction, \nindustry growth slowed from 11.6% in 2017 to 7.9% last year. \nElectricity generation, accounting for 20% of industrial output, \ndecelerated from a 33.0% rise in 2017 to 8.3% last year as no \nnew power plants were added to enhance existing annual \nproduction capacity (Figure 3.25.2). Meanwhile, buoyed by \nan 8.2% increase in international tourist arrivals, growth in \nservices accelerated from 4.5% in 2017 to 7.4% (Figure 3.25.3).\nEven as GDP growth slowed, higher food prices caused by \n\nweaker farm production and higher international oil prices \npushed average inflation from 0.8% in 2017 to 2.0% last year. \nInflation peaked in July 2018 at 2.4% year on year but fell back \nto 1.5% in December (Figure 3.25.4). \n\nThe steep growth slowdown in electricity generation \nslowed growth in the volume of electricity exports from 19.8% \nin 2017 to 7.2% last year. As a result, growth in merchandise \nexports fell by almost half in US dollar terms from 19.8% in \n2017 to 10.0%. Meanwhile, despite higher international oil \nprices, softening demand for imports held growth in imports to \nless than 3.0% in dollar terms, narrowing the trade deficit from \nthe equivalent of 11.4% of GDP in 2017 to 9.0% last year.\n\n3.25.1\u2002 Supply-side contributions  \n\nto GDP growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nTaxes less subsidies\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.6\n\n7.3\n\n7.0\n\n6.9\n\n6.5\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: Lao Statistics Bureau; Asian Development Outlook \ndatabase.\n\n3.25.2\u2002Electricity generation\n\nTotal generation\nHongsa Lignite Power Plant\n\nThousand gigawatt-hours\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nThis chapter was written by Rattanatay Luanglatbandith and Soulinthone \nLeuangkhamsing of the Lao PDR Resident Mission, ADB, Vientiane.\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Lao PDR Ministry of Energy and Mines.\n\n\f278(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nDespite a strong rise in international tourist arrivals, \nnet service receipts worsened last year. In sum, the current \naccount deficit narrowed from the equivalent of 11.2% of GDP \nin 2017 to 8.6% in 2018. With foreign direct investment rising, \nthe overall balance of payments posted a small surplus, and \ninternational\u00a0reserves edged up from $1.0 billion at the end \nof 2017 to $1.1 billion a year later. Despite this improvement, \nreserves remained perilously low, providing cover for only \n1.5\u00a0months of imports.\n\nThe government\u2019s efforts to consolidate its finances brought \n\nthe fiscal deficit down from the equivalent of 5.6% of GDP in \n2017 to 4.6% last year as public expenditure, equal 21.8% of GDP \nin 2017, was contained at 20.3%. Meanwhile, revenue slipped \nfrom 16.2% of GDP in 2017 to 15.7% last\u00a0year. Monetary policy \naimed to keep the Lao kip\u2013US dollar exchange rate within \na narrow daily trading band of 5% or less, as\u00a0well as contain \ngrowth in credit and the supply of money (Figure\u00a03.25.5). \n\nEconomic prospects\nSlowing growth in the advanced economies\u2014and closer to \nhome in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Thailand, and \nViet Nam\u2014does not augur well for the growth prospects of the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). However, growth \nin agriculture should edge up, and electricity generation should \naccelerate with the expected addition of 1,500 megawatts \nto capacity. The construction of the Vang Vieng\u2013Vientiane \nExpressway and the ramping up of work on a railway linking \nthe PRC and the Lao PDR, to be completed by 2021, should \nboost GDP growth, as should likely continued buoyancy in \ninternational tourist arrivals. GDP growth should thus sustain \nlast year\u2019s pace of 6.5% both this year and next (Figure 3.25.6). \n\nBy sector, growth in industry is forecast to edge up \n\nslightly to 8.1% in 2019 on solid construction and as growth in \nelectricity generation resumes. Agriculture is expected to grow \nby 2.5% both this year and next. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s \npromotion of the PRC and the Lao PDR as twin tourist \ndestinations is seen to help services maintain growth at 6.7%. \nInflation is forecast to remain at 2.0% this year and next, \nwith global oil prices forecast lower and food prices subdued as \nagriculture recovers. \n\nElectricity exports will edge up this year with new \n\ngenerating capacity. Total exports are thus seen rising by 12.0% \nin US dollar terms this year and next. Meanwhile, import \ngrowth will accelerate by 13.5% this year and 12.0% next \nyear on imports of capital goods for hydropower, expressway, \nand rail projects. The current account deficit is thus \nforecast to widen to 9.5% of GDP in 2019 and 10.0% in 2020 \n(Figure\u00a03.25.7). International reserves are forecast to fall to just \nunder $1.0 billion, providing cover for 1.3 months of imports. \n\n3.25.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n\u20026.5\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20139.5\n\n2020\n\n\u2002\u20026.5\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u201310.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.25.3\u2002Tourist arrivals\n\nMillion arrivals\n5\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 19 March 2019).\n\n3.25.4\u2002Inflation\n\n% change year on year\n4\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSources: Bank of Lao; CEIC Data Company (both accessed \n12 March 2019).\n\n3.25.5\u2002Monetary indicators\n\nGrowth of money \nsupply\n\nGrowth of commercial\nbank loans\n\n% change year on year \n\n% change year on year \n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ3 Q1\n2015\n\nQ3 Q1\n2016\n\nQ3 Q1\n2017\n\nQ3 Q1\n2018\n\nQ3\n\nQ = quarter.\nSources: Bank of Lao; CEIC Data Company (both accessed \n12 March 2019).\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n32\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nLao PDR\u2002\u2002279\n\nProgress in consolidating government finances is expected \n\n3.25.6\u2002GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\nto gradually yield better results. The fiscal deficit is likely to \nsubside to the equivalent of 4.3% of GDP this year and 3.7% in \n2020. Expenditure is forecast to equal about 20% of GDP this \nyear and next, while revenue including grants is forecast to \nhover at around 16% of GDP. The government has withheld a \nsalary increase for civil servants and halved the annual intake \nof new civil servants to 1,500 in 2019.\n\nAlthough inflation remains low, monetary policy has little \nroom to ease credit conditions because of constant pressure on \nthe exchange rate and the need to shield the country\u2019s fragile \nbalance of payments, which poses the major domestic risk to \nthe outlook. Another domestic risk is vulnerability to natural \nhazards. An uncertain global trading environment poses the \nmain external risk.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reforming public finances\nStrong economic growth in the Lao PDR over the years has \nbeen shadowed by unsustainable fiscal deficits and rising \npublic debt. Including publicly guaranteed debt, public debt \nnow equals about 65% of GDP (Figure 3.25.8). About 80% of the \npublic debt is in foreign currency. The ratio of debt service to \nGDP has increased in the last 4 years as the government relied \nmore on capital markets and less on concessional bilateral \nsources in recent years.\n\nmacroeconomic and financial stability. A 2018 analysis of debt \nsustainability by the International Monetary Fund places the \nLao PDR at high risk of debt distress. Containing fiscal deficits \nis critical to reaching a more sustainable ratio. This demands \nin turn further containing government expenditure and \nraising\u00a0revenue.\n\nToward strengthening public debt management and \ninstituting tax reform, the government adopted a law on \npublic debt management in 2018 that establishes a ceiling \nfor public debt at 60.0% of GDP. Any public investment \nproject exceeding $50 million must now seek approval from \nthe National Assembly. The government aims to reduce the \nfiscal deficit by more than a third, to less than 3.0% of GDP \nby\u00a02025. The\u00a0government has delayed a salary increase for \ncivil\u00a0servants. Its Public Finance Development Strategy 2025 \nand Vision to 2030 announce reforms that will improve public \ndebt management and medium-term fiscal planning and \nbudgeting. \n\nSuccessful implementation depends on strong political \nwill and leadership in the Ministry of Finance to effectively \ncollaborate and coordinate with other ministries. Only then \nwill the Lao PDR be able to gradually restore fiscal and public \ndebt sustainability. \n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n%\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n-20\n\n-25\n\n75\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n3.25.7\u2002Current account balance forecast\n\n3.25.8\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nPublic debt\n\nFiscal balance \n\n% of GDP\n\n% of GDP\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Fiscal balance is on an inverted axis.\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; \nIMF\u00a0estimates.\n\nContinued high fiscal deficits and high public debt threaten \n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nForecast\n\n\fMalaysia\n\nGrowth slowed last year as external demand softened and global trade tensions mounted. \nInflation  remained  subdued,  and  the  current  account  surplus  widened.  As  demand \ncontinues  to  weaken  this  year,  growth  is  forecast  to  slow  further.  Inflation  will  quicken \nback  to  trend  as  the  effect  of  a  temporary  tax  holiday  fades.  With  the  public  sector  role \nin  investment  shrinking,  policies  and  programs  are  needed  to  boost  private  investment.\n\nEconomic performance\nDespite softer exports and slowing domestic investment \nshaving 1.2 percentage points off the 2017 growth rate, growth \nin 2018 held up at 4.7% (Figure 3.26.1). Growth in exports of \ngoods and services by volume plunged from 9.4% in 2017 to \n1.5% as foreign demand weakened for electronics, palm oil, and \nrefined petroleum products.\n\nDomestic investment reversed 6.4% expansion in 2017 \nto contract by 4.4%. Public investment sank from stagnation \nin 2017 to a 5.2% decline as a new government suspended \nseveral public infrastructure projects that had been approved \nby the previous administration. Growth in private investment \nfell by more than half from 9.3% in 2017 to 4.5% last year \nwith investors uncertain about the new government\u2019s policy \ndirection, concerned about the trade conflict between the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the US, and gloomy at the \noutlook for the global semiconductor market. Investment in \nresidential construction fell as measures to curb the real estate \nmarket included shortened mortgage maturities and lowered \nloan-to-value ratios. \n\nthe slump in investment. Growth in private consumption \nsurged from 7.0% in 2017 to a 6-year high of 8.1% thanks to \nmodestly higher wages and expanded employment in the \nfirst half of the year, a temporary tax holiday, and higher \ngovernment cash transfers to low-income households. \nThe\u00a0abolition of the goods and services tax ahead of the \nimposition of a new sales and services tax created a 3-month \ntax-free window in June\u2013August that consumers and \nbusinesses used to generate substantial increases in retail sales \n(Figure 3.26.2). Growth in public consumption moderated, \nmeanwhile, from 5.4% in 2017 to 3.3%. \n\nThis chapter was written by Thiam Hee Ng of the Southeast Asia Department, \nADB, Manila, and Valerie A.

Agriculture \nreversed 7.2% expansion in 2017 to contract by 0.4% last year, \nlargely because of softening palm oil prices internationally. \nIndustry growth slowed from 4.9% in 2017 to 3.4% as external \ndemand for electronics weakened and pipeline repairs \ndisrupted production and drove down natural gas output. \nConstruction growth slowed from 6.7% in 2017 to 4.2% \nlast\u00a0year as the new government decided to suspend several \ninfrastructure projects. Meanwhile, services, providing more \nthan half of GDP, improved on growth at 6.2% in 2017 with \n6.8% expansion on buoyance in wholesale and retail trade and \nin finance and business services.\n\nAs growth slowed, inflationary pressures eased not only \nbecause of lower aggregate demand, but also reflecting the \npartial reintroduction of fuel subsidies and the windfall from \nthe temporary tax holiday. Inflation thus fell from 3.8% in 2017 \nto 1.0% last year (Figure 3.26.3). \n\nGrowth in merchandise exports slowed in US dollar terms \nfrom 13.3% in 2017 to 10.5% in 2018. Merchandise imports also \nexperienced slower growth, decelerating from 13.8% to 10.4%, \nlargely because the slump in domestic investment cut demand \nfor imports of capital and intermediate goods. On\u00a0balance, \nthe trade surplus rose by 10.8% to $30.1 billion last\u00a0year. \nNet\u00a0service receipts declined, however, as net payments to \nforeign service providers exceeded tourism receipts, and \nas foreign workers boosted their outward remittances. \nThe\u00a0current account surplus thus shrank from the equivalent \nof\u00a03.0% of GDP in 2017 to 2.3% (Figure 3.26.4). \n\nMeanwhile, the financial account registered net inflow \nfor the first time in 7 years, at $4.7 billion. Portfolio capital \nnet outflow of $11.0 billion was more than offset by larger net \ninflow of foreign direct investment and other inflows in the \nsecond half of the year. The overall balance of payments was \nthus a small surplus last year, and by December 2018 foreign \nexchange reserves stood at $99.8 billion, providing cover for \n7.4\u00a0months of imports. \n\nThe budget deficit widened from the equivalent of \n3.0% of GDP in 2017 to 3.7% in 2018, more than the 2.8% \ndeficit originally targeted under the 2018 Budget Report. \nThe\u00a0temporary reintroduction of fuel subsidies and the removal \nof the goods and services tax drained government coffers even \nas oil-related revenues picked up. The government had hoped \nto keep the budget deficit close to target by raising oil-related \nrevenues and cutting nonessential spending, but government \nexpenditure nevertheless grew by 9.6%, more than double \nthe 2017 rate, on higher government transfers, debt service \npayments, and operating expenditure. Meanwhile, Bank Negara \nMalaysia, the central bank, maintained a neutral monetary \npolicy, its overnight policy rate unchanged at 3.25%. \n\n\f282(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nEconomic prospects \nWith slower growth in the advanced economies and \nmoderation in the global electronics trade, export growth is \nexpected to remain weak. Domestic demand will continue \nto slow this year but is expected to pick up in 2020 with a \nrecovery in private investment. GDP growth will likely slow \nthis year to 4.5% and pick up to 4.7% in 2020 (Figure 3.26.5). \nPrivate consumption growth is expected to pull back \nsomewhat from last year\u2019s strong performance. Although \nthe recent introduction of an income tax refund may boost \nconsumption to some extent, the end of the temporary tax \nholiday last year with the introduction of the sales and service \ntax should moderate growth in private consumption to a \nstill robust pace of 6.0% this year and next, underpinned \nas it is by low unemployment and rising wages. Growth in \npublic consumption will continue to slow in both years as the \ngovernment cuts costs. \n\nPublic investment is likely to slow in both years as well, with \n\nthe government continuing to reconsider and reprioritize its \ninvestment program. With several large infrastructure projects \nalready deferred, the government is looking at options to reduce \ncosts on other projects currently in the works. Its renegotiation \nof several large investment projects has unsettled some private \ninvestors, adding to their concerns about weakening export \nprospects. The RAM business confidence index showed sagging \nsentiment in the initial months of 2019 (Figure\u00a03.26.6).\n\nPrivate investment is therefore likely to remain subdued \nthis year. It is poised for recovery next year, though, with the \nimplementation of a large backlog of projects with foreign \ndirect investment. Historical trends show 60%\u201380% of \ninvestment approvals implemented after 2 years (Figure\u00a03.26.7 \nand Table\u00a03.26.2). A giant new refinery and petrochemical \ncomplex at Pengerang, on the southern coast of Peninsular \nMalaysia, is scheduled to become operational by the end of \n2019 with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels of crude \nper day. The complex is expected to attract additional private \ninvestment to the Pengerang area as investors take advantage \nof enhanced feedstock availability and well-developed \ninfrastructure, including a power plant, liquefied natural gas \nterminal, and deepwater port. This should help offset the lull in \nmanufacturing investment.\n\nAgriculture will rebound this year from contraction \n\nlast\u00a0year, but growth will moderate again in 2020 as it returns \nto trend. Industry growth will slow to 3.1% this year, mainly \nbecause of weakness in manufacturing, but is expected to pick \nup to 3.8% in 2020 as private investment recovers. Some of the \nnew investment into manufacturing may start kicking in with \nnew production next year. Construction will stagnate this year \nand next as real estate remains weak and fewer construction \npermits are issued. Growth in services will moderate to 5.8% \n\n3.26.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n4.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.4\n\n4.7\n\n2.7\n\n2.4\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.26.5\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\nPotential growth rate\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n3.26.6\u2002 Consumer and business \nconfidence\u00a0indexes\n\nMIER consumer \nsentiment index\n\nMIER business \ncondition index\n\nRAM business\ncon\ufb01dence index\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ1\n2019\n\nMIER = Malaysia Institute of Economics Research.\nNote: Above 100 indicates improvement in business \nconditions and rising consumer confidence.\nSources: Haver Analytics (accessed 11 March 2019); \nRAM\u00a0Rating Services Berhad.\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nIndex\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nMalaysia\u2002\u2002283\n\nthis year and next, returning to trend after the boost it got \nlast year from temporary exemption from the goods and \nservices\u00a0tax.\n\nInflation is expected to rebound from its dip last year to \n2.0% this year and 2.7% next year, despite slowing growth and \nlower global oil prices, with the fading of last year\u2019s downward \npressure on prices from the tax holiday. In 2020, inflation \nshould return to its medium-term trend (Figure 3.26.8).\n\nExport growth is expected to continue to slow in line with \n\nweaker global economic conditions. Import growth should \nalso remain subdued with slowing economic growth at home. \nAlthough exports may get a small boost from resumed natural \ngas exports after last year\u2019s disruption, as well as some pickup \nfrom the redirection of manufacturing production with the \ntrade conflict between the US and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, export prospects remain muted. As the Pengerang \npetrochemical and refining complex hits full production in \n2020, though, it will likely provide some impetus to exports. \nThe suspension of infrastructure projects will reduce imports \nof construction materials and machinery, though these \nimports may revive in 2020 as private investment recovers. \nOn balance, the current account surplus is forecast to widen \nmarginally to the equivalent of 2.4% of GDP in 2019 and 2020. \nWith foreign direct investment inflows more than offsetting \nportfolio outflows, the financial account is expected to remain \nin surplus. The external payments position should therefore \nremain comfortable. \n\nDespite slowing growth, the government will consolidate \n\nits finances and pursue institutional reform to strengthen \npublic finance and the fiscal management system. In line \nwith consolidation, the government is adopting zero-based \nbudgeting, which requires that all expenses be justified for \neach new period; improving government procurement systems; \nand moving away from cash to accrual accounting, counting \nincome when it is earned and liabilities when they are billed, \nnot when cash changes hands. The government is further \ncommitted to greater transparency in reporting contingent \nliabilities and off-budget investments.\n\nMonetary policy is expected to be accommodative. \nThe\u00a0central bank is unlikely to raise its policy interest rate \nwith inflation not forecast to breach the official target. \nThe\u00a0financial system remains strong, with banks well \ncapitalized and sufficiently liquid to provide ample credit and \nto ride out any financial volatility. The resulting policy space \nallows the central bank to respond quickly and effectively as \nmacroeconomic conditions evolve.\n\nRisks to the outlook tilt downward. Any escalation of \ntrade tensions between the US and People\u2019s Republic of China \ncould derail Malaysia\u2019s highly trade-dependent economy. \nThe\u00a0new government\u2019s continuing reexamination of many large \n\n3.26.7\u2002 High-tech manufacturing FDI \napprovals by country, Q1\u2013Q3 \n2014\u20132018\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nUnited States\nNetherlands\nJapan and the Republic of Korea\n\n$ million\n\n3,000\n\n2,000\n\n1,000\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: High-tech manufacturing includes machinery & \nequipment, electronics and electrical products, transport \nequipment, and scientific and measuring equipment.\nSource: Malaysian Investment Development Authority. \nhttp://www.mida.gov.my/home.\n\n3.26.2\u2002 Investment approvals, 2018\n\nForeign\n(% total \napprovals)\n\nGrowth \n(% year on year)\n\nForeign Domestic \n\n56.0\n\n83.0\n\n14.0\n\n46.0\n\n\u200211.0\n\n\u200224.0\n\n\u201325.0\n\n\u2002\u20137.0\n\n65.1\n\n43.5\n\n10.5\n\n20.7\n\nManufacturing\n\nSector\n\nPrimary\n\nServices\n\nTotal\n\nSource: Malaysian Investment Development \nAuthority. http://www.mida.gov.my/home.\n\n3.26.8\u2002 Inflation\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\u2212year average\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n\f284(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\ninfrastructure projects approved by the previous administration \ncreates uncertainty for foreign and domestic investors alike. \nFinally, persistent oversupply in the housing market could \ntrigger housing price declines and dampen confidence.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014boosting private \ninvestment to take up slack in \npublic\u00a0investment\nMalaysia\u2019s export-led growth model has succeeded in \nestablishing a strong manufacturing base, and its investment \nclimate continues to be one of the most attractive in Asia. \nThe\u00a0model has enabled the country to raise the ratio of \ninvestment to GDP significantly over 25%, which is high by \ninternational standards. Almost half of domestic investment \nin\u00a02000 to 2015 has been public (Figure 3.26.9). \n\nThe new government\u2019s decision to cancel or postpone \ninvestment projects is a tacit admission that the return on \nmany public projects is low and will only add to the nation\u2019s \nindebtedness. It is thus highly likely that public investment will \ncontinue to slow in the coming years. As the government winds \ndown many investment projects, it needs to consider how it can \ncatalyze private investment. \n\nAs policy makers strive to foster a new \u201centrepreneurial \neconomy,\u201d to echo a phrase used in the 2019 budget, they need \nto pay attention to both the scale and the quality of private \ninvestment. This will be best achieved with policy measures that \nimprove the business and investment climate in ways that attract \nprivate investors. This requires concerted action in three areas:\nFirst, the government should minimize policy uncertainty \n\nby better communicating its capital spending priorities and \nenhancing transparency in its fiscal accounts, particularly on \ncontingent liabilities and tax expenditure. The government \nis adopting some of these policies but should broaden their \napplication to the rest of the public sector. \n\nSecond, the government should invest in strengthening \n\nworkforce skills to attract private investment in high \ntechnology. Such investments align with the vision of \nmaking\u00a0Malaysia\u2014as articulated in the Industry 4.0 \ndevelopment strategy unveiled in November 2018\u2014a strategic \npartner in smart manufacturing, a primary destination for \nhigh-technology industries, and a provider of total tech \nsolutions for the region (Figure 3.26.10). \n\nFinally, the government should minimize tax incentives \nfor investors, which studies have shown are costly but tend \nto do little to sustain private investment over the long term. \nRather than undermine fiscal revenue through tax incentives, \nthe government can use the revenue it collects from investors \nfor vocational training and enhancing workforce skills, among \nother priorities.\n\n3.26.9\u2002 Share of investment in GDP \n\nand growth in machinery and \nequipment\u00a0investment\n\nPublic\nPrivate\n\nGrowth of machinery and\nequipment investment\n(constant 2010 prices)\n\nShare of GDP\n\n% change year on year\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2000\u20132015 2016\n\n2017\n\nAverage\n\nH1\n2018\n\nH2\n2018\n\nH = half.\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n3.26.10\u2002 National goals and targets \nunder\u00a0Industry 4.0\n\nIncrease\nproductivity per capita\nin manufacturing\nby 30%\n\n30%\n\nIncrease the\nnumber of\nhigh-skilled workers\nin manufacturing\nfrom 18% to 35%\n\nElevate the absolute\ncontribution of\nmanufacturing to the\nnational economy by\nover 50% to $94 billion\n\nMalaysia\nIndustry 4.0\ntargets for\n2025\n(from 2016\nbaseline\n\ufb01gures)\n\nInnovate: Raise the\ninternational ranking on\nthe Global Innovation\nIndex to 30th from 35th\n\nSource: ADB estimates based on Industry 4WRD: \nNational\u00a0Policy on Industry 4.0.\n\n\fMyanmar\n\nGrowth  slowed  in  the  6-month  transition  to  a  new  fiscal  year.  The  current  account  deficit \nnarrowed, and inflation rose. Growth is projected to pick up in the near term on an expected \nturnaround  in  tourism-related  businesses  and  foreign  direct  investment.  Inflation  will \nease  this  year  and  accelerate  next  year,  and  the  current  account  will  widen  in  both  years. \nExpediting  economic  reform  promises  to  sustain  robust  growth  over  the  medium  term.\n\nEconomic performance \nDespite stronger exports, weaker domestic demand likely \ncaused GDP growth to slow from 6.8% in fiscal year 2017 \n(FY2017, ended 31 March 2018) to 6.2% year on year in the \ntransitional fiscal year 2018 (TFY2018, from 1 April 2018 \nto 30\u00a0September 2018) (Figure 3.27.1). Helped partly by \ndepreciation of the Myanmar kyat, merchandise exports rose \nsharply in US dollar terms from 10.5% growth in FY2017 to \n19.0% year on year in TFY2018.\n\nDomestic consumption was likely weakened by slowing \n\nincome growth and higher inflation. International tourist \narrivals from January to August 2018 rose by about 1% from the \nsame period a year earlier as a steady increase in Asian\u00a0tourists \noffset a drop in visitors from the Americas, Europe, and \nOceania. Domestic investment was sluggish, possibly reflecting \nslower disbursement of government expenditure, weaker \ninvestor sentiment, and a decline in foreign direct investment \n(FDI) approvals. These approvals plunged from $4.1\u00a0billion in \nApril\u2013September 2017 to $1.8 billion in TFY2018. \n\nBy sector, while agriculture posted higher growth with \nfavorable weather in most of TFY2018, growth in industry and \nservices slowed. Agriculture and allied activities, providing \na quarter of GDP, accelerated from 1.3% growth in FY2017 to \n2.0% year on year in TFY2018. Sluggish domestic consumption \nand investment dragged down industry growth to 8.7% year on \nyear and services growth to 6.8% year on year in TFY2018.\n\nEven as growth moderated, higher international oil prices \n\nand kyat depreciation against the US dollar fueled inflation \nat 7.1% year on year in TFY2018, up from 4.0% in FY2017. \nFrom\u00a0April to September 2018, the kyat depreciated from \nMK1,330 to MK1,552 per dollar (Figure 3.27.2), losing 16.7% of\u00a0its \nvalue. Some of this depreciation is attributed to the removal in \nAugust 2018 of a foreign exchange trading band for the currency.\n\nThis chapter was written by Yumiko Tamura of the Myanmar Resident Mission, \nADB, Nay Pyi Taw.\n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\nMK/$\n\n1,600\n\n1,400\n\n1,200\n\n1,000\n\n3.27.1\u2002GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nEstimate\n\nNote: From 2014 to 2017, years are fiscal years ending \n31\u00a0March of next year; 2018 covers April to September.\nSources: Central Statistical Organization; Central Bank of \nMyanmar; ADB estimates.\n\n3.27.2\u2002Exchange rate and inflation rate\n\nExchange rate\n\nIn\ufb02ation rate\n\n%\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\nMar\n2017\n\nAug\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSources: Central Statistical Organization; Central Bank of \nMyanmar; CEIC database (accessed 19 March 2019).\n\n\f286(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nSluggish domestic demand slowed growth in imports in \nUS dollar terms from 9.3% in FY2017 to 5.5% year on year in \nTFY2018, significantly narrowing the trade deficit. Robust \nnet service receipts and the narrowing trade deficit slashed \nthe current account deficit by more than half, from the \nequivalent of 4.7% of GDP in FY2017 to 2.0% in TFY2018. \nIn\u00a0September\u00a02018, international reserves provided cover for \nslightly more than 3 months of imports. \n\nThe government budget for TFY2018 indicated an \nexpansionary fiscal stance through more ambitious public \nspending targets despite no projected improvement in revenue. \nThe budgeted fiscal deficit was equal to 6.2% of GDP, much \nhigher than in previous years. As TFY2018 was only in the wet \nseason, though, when difficult weather interferes with project \nimplementation, the actual fiscal deficit was likely lower, equal \nto about 4.5% of GDP.\n\nMonetary policy continued to focus on instituting a more \nflexible exchange rate regime and improving banks\u2019 compliance \nwith prudential regulations and credit risk management. \nAs\u00a0of\u00a0June 2018, growth in broad money (M2) was 18.2% year \non year and growth in credit to the private sector was 23.7% \nyear on year.\n\nEconomic prospects \nA weakening external environment, notably a continuing \nslowdown in the People\u2019s Republic of China, dims export \nprospects for Myanmar. However, domestic and foreign \ninvestment should improve in response to the opening up to FDI \nof retail and wholesale trade and the insurance business, as well \nas from the continued implementation of the Companies\u00a0Act, \nwhich clarifies procedures for setting up businesses. \nGrowth\u00a0is\u00a0forecast higher at 6.6% year on year in FY2019 \n(a\u00a0full\u00a0year ending 30 September 2019) and 6.8% in FY2020.\n\nFDI approvals already show signs of revival. From October \n\n2018 to January 2019, FDI approvals nearly doubled to about \n$1.5\u00a0billion from $823 million in the same period a year earlier \nas investors from Singapore and elsewhere in Asia took higher \nstakes in manufacturing and services.

Even \nas  the  external  environment  weakens  in  2019  and  2020,  growth  is  expected  to  pick  up \nin  both  years  on  strong  domestic  demand.  Inflation  surged  last  year  but  is  forecast  to  be \nwithin  the  government\u2019s  target  range  this  year  and  next.  The  current  account  deficit  will \npersist  under  investment-led  growth.  Agricultural  reform  to  lift  productivity  and  promote \noff-farm  livelihoods  promises  to  foster  inclusive  growth. \n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth moderated from 6.7% in 2017 to 6.2% in 2018, \nlargely in line with average annual growth of 6.3% since 2010. \nHigher domestic investment and consumption partly offset a \nslowdown in growth of exports of goods and services. \n\nInvestment rose by 13.9% last year, improving on a 9.4% \n\nincrease in 2017 and making in 2018 the largest demand-side \ncontribution to GDP growth (Figure 3.28.1). Growth in public \ninvestment in construction rose from 12.7% in 2017 to 21.2% \nlast year (Figure 3.28.2). Private investment remained robust \nas well, with a 12.9% rise in private construction and higher \npurchases of machinery and equipment. Consequently, fixed \ninvestment rose to equal 27.0% of GDP in 2018, its highest since \nthe mid-1980s (Figure 3.28.3). \n\n Private consumption growth softened from 5.9% in 2017 to \n5.6%, finding support from a relatively low unemployment rate \nof 5.3%, steady remittances from overseas Filipinos, and a cut \nin the personal income tax rate for most workers. Remittances \nrose by 3.0% in 2018 to reach $32.2 billion, equal to 9.7% of \nGDP. Growth in government consumption quickened to 12.8%, \nwith higher spending on social services and a hike in salaries \nfor government employees. Meanwhile, growth in exports of \ngoods and services slowed in real terms from 19.5% in 2017 to \n11.5% last year, while imports rose rapidly in response to higher \ndemand for investment and consumer goods. \n\nBy sector, services and industry were the drivers of \ngrowth, despite slowing a bit from 2017 (Figure 3.28.4). \nGrowth in services reached 6.6% in 2018, only slightly down \nfrom 6.8% in 2017, and generated nearly two-thirds of GDP \ngrowth last\u00a0year.

Inflation was driven \nby constraints on food supply and by higher global oil prices. \nIncreases in excise taxes on fuel, sugar-sweetened beverages, \nand cigarettes in January 2018 added to inflationary pressure \nlast year. To ease food price inflation, the government removed \nadministrative barriers to agricultural imports. Complementing \nthis measure, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central bank, \nraised its policy rate by a cumulative 175 basis points from May \nto November 2018 to address demand-side pressures and quell \ninflation expectations. These measures quickly eased inflation, \nwhich slowed from a peak of 6.7% year on year in October \n2018 to 3.8% in February 2019. Core inflation also slowed, from \na high of 5.1% in November 2018 to 3.9% in February\u00a02019 \n(Figure 3.28.5). The higher policy rate reined in growth in \nbroad money (M3) from 13.0% year on year in January 2018 \nto 7.6% a year later, as well as credit to the private sector from \n17.1% to 13.7% over the same period. \n\nThe current account deficit widened from the equivalent \nof 0.7% of GDP in 2017 to 2.4% in 2018. In response to strong \ndomestic investment, imports of machinery and equipment \nand of construction materials increased sharply. Imports\u00a0thus \nrose by 9.4% in US dollar terms, while export earnings shrank \nby 0.3%, widening the trade deficit. Higher remittances \nand earnings from exports of services partly cushioned the \nmerchandise trade deficit (Figure 3.28.6).\n\nIn the financial account, net inflows of foreign direct \ninvestment moderated from a high of $10.3 billion in 2017 to \n$9.8 billion in 2018, while net outflows of portfolio investment \ndeclined (Figure 3.28.7). The overall balance of payments \ndeficit widened from the equivalent of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 to \n0.7%. Foreign exchange reserves stood at $82.8 billion at the \nend of February 2019, providing cover for 7.3 months of imports \nof goods and services and income payments. The country\u2019s \nexternal payments position improved further as a broad \ndowntrend in external debt brought it from the equivalent of \n59.7% of GDP in 2005 to 23.9% last year.\n\nFiscal policy was expansionary, with the fiscal deficit \nwidening from the equivalent of 2.2% of GDP in 2017 to 3.2% \nlast year. This took the deficit slightly above the government\u2019s \nceiling of 3.0%, reflecting its higher infrastructure and \nsocial investments and also improved budget execution as \n\n3.28.3\u2002Fixed investment\n\n% of GDP\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2018\n\nSources: World Development Indicators online database; \nCEIC Data Company (both accessed 12 March 2019).\n\n3.28.4\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n6.1\n\n6.1\n\n6.9\n\n6.7\n\n6.2\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 12 March 2019).\n\n3.28.5\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nHeadline\nCore\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 12 March 2019).\n\n\f290(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\ngovernment disbursements slightly exceeded the budget \nprogram\u2014a reversal of underspending in the past, by 13% \non average in 2014 and 2015 and by 3% in 2016 and 2017. \nOn\u00a0the\u00a0revenue side, the ratio of tax collection to GDP \nimproved from 14.2% in 2017 to 14.7% in 2018, supported by \nrevenue increments from the Tax Reform for Acceleration \nand Inclusion (TRAIN) Law. Despite the higher fiscal \ndeficit, national government debt stood at 41.9% of GDP in \nDecember 2018, in line with government objectives for fiscal \nsustainability (Figure\u00a03.28.8).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is projected to pick up to 6.4% this year and next \nas strengthening domestic investment and consumption more \nthan offset weakening external demand (Figure 3.28.9). \n Private consumption should pick up with a low \n\nunemployment rate, growth in formal sector employment, \na continued rise in remittances, and lower inflation. \nThe\u00a0unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in January 2019 with the \ncreation of an additional 1.4 million jobs for wage-earners and \nsalaried employees. Also boosting consumption is increased \npublic expenditure on social services. The Universal Health \nCare Law, passed in February 2019, automatically enrolls all \ncitizens in the national health insurance program and thus \npromises to expand health care services, which should give an \nimpetus to consumption. Election-related spending ahead of a \nMay 2019 midterm poll will modestly lift aggregate demand.\n\nPublic investment will drive domestic investment with the \nimplementation of major public infrastructure projects such\u00a0as \nbridges, expressways, ports, and railways. The government \naims to raise public infrastructure outlays from a 2017\u20132018 \naverage equal to 6.3% of GDP to 7% by 2022 under its \nBuild\u00a0Build Build infrastructure program. Efforts to improve \nbudget execution continue with a focus on project preparation \nand implementation including procurement. \n\nProspects for private investment remain favorable. \nImports\u00a0of capital goods and credit to businesses have \ncontinued to grow. Momentum in private construction is \nsustained by continuing strong demand for office and retail \nspace and for housing. Building permit approvals rose by 20.7% \nyear on year in the fourth quarter of 2018. Recent reform, \nsuch as the Ease of Doing Business Act approved in 2018, \nstreamlines procedures for government transactions, including \nfor local governments.

Business \nprocess outsourcing will continue to expand, particularly \noutside Manila. Growth in manufacturing is expected to \nhold up well, supported by domestic demand, with a modest \nexpansion indicated in the February 2019 manufacturing \npurchasing managers\u2019 index. Steady foreign direct investment \ninflows to manufacturing bode well for the sector\u2019s growth \nprospects in the near term. Spurred by public infrastructure \nprojects, construction is forecast to remain buoyant. \n\nmarket, inflation is projected to moderate to 3.8% in 2019 \nand 3.5% in 2020 as global oil prices decline and last year\u2019s \nmonetary tightening continues to be effective (Figure\u00a03.28.10). \nA second round of excise tax rises on fuels in 2019 and a \npossible decline in agricultural output this year may add to \ninflationary pressure, though food supply should improve \nfollowing the approval in February 2019 of a law that replaces \nquantitative restrictions on rice imports with tariffs. \n\nAs prospects for export growth soften, accelerating \n\ndomestic investment and consumption should continue to draw \nin imports, keeping the merchandise trade and current account \nin deficit. However, continued strength in net service exports \nand lower international prices for oil should cushion the deficit \nsomewhat. On balance, the current account deficit is forecast at \n2.3% of GDP in 2019 and 2.4% in 2020. \n\nAs inflation stays within the government\u2019s target range \nof 2%\u20134%, monetary policy is likely to remain unchanged for \nsome time. The fiscal deficit, meanwhile, has a ceiling set at \nthe equivalent of 3.2% of GDP for 2019 and 3.0% for 2020. \nLegislating the government\u2019s proposed tax reform is vital to \nsustaining higher public infrastructure and social investments.\n\nRisks to the growth outlook tilt to the downside. \nExternal\u00a0risks would stem from an unexpectedly deep \nslowdown of economic growth in the advanced economies, \nwhich are major export markets and sources of foreign direct \ninvestment for the Philippines (Figure 3.28.11).

Domestic risks to growth would be severe or \nprolonged El Ni\u00f1o dry spells and a delay in approving the 2019 \nbudget, which could slow the implementation of new large \ninfrastructure projects and social programs this year. \n\nGDP growth prospects for this year and next are supported \n\nby recent government reform to lay the foundation for raising \ngrowth potential in the medium term. Besides a massive \ninfrastructure program, the government has implemented the \nTRAIN Law, the first package of comprehensive reform to \nmake the tax system more equitable and efficient. Other\u00a0recent \nreforms aim to improve the ease of doing business in the \nPhilippines. Social protection reform and universal health \ncare will support human capital development and help narrow \nwide household income disparities. The rollout of a national \nidentification system that unifies all government identification \ncards into one will help facilitate financial inclusion and \nimprove access to social services by the poor.\n\nAnother reform, the Bangsamoro Organic Law in 2018, \ncreates an autonomous area on the large southern island of \nMindanao and could spur development over the long term.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014pursuing agricultural \nreform and off-farm incomes\nThe rapid rise in food price inflation in 2018 reflected, at least \nin part, structural and policy impediments to agriculture \ngrowth. Annualized food price inflation reached a high of 9.7% \nyear on year in September 2018 and averaged 6.8% in 2018. \nGrowth in agriculture value added was essentially stagnant \nin 2018. Indeed, agriculture has been underperforming for \nthe past 2 decades. It grew by an average of 2.9% annually \nfrom 2000 to 2010, then growth slowed by half to 1.5% from \n2011 to 2018. Improvement in labor productivity in Philippine \nagriculture compares poorly with that of its regional peers \n(Figure 3.28.12). \n\nNotwithstanding its lackluster performance, agriculture \n\nremains the livelihood of many rural families. Half of the \npopulation resides in rural areas, and nearly one quarter \nof all employment is in agriculture. Poverty in rural areas \nis higher than the national average and especially high for \nfarm households. According to a 2015 family income and \nexpenditure survey, almost 35% of farmers and fisherfolk \nlive below the national poverty line. As such, both farm and \noff-farm income-generating activities are critical for fostering \ninclusive growth.\n\nWhile typhoons and droughts have played a role in erratic \ngrowth in agriculture and periodic food price instability, policy \nshortcomings have also weighed on the sector\u2019s development. \n\n3.28.11\u2002Merchandise export markets, 2018\n\nOthers\n6.8%\n\nPRC\n12.9%\n\nEU\n13.1%\n\nJapan\n14.0%\n\nEast Asia\nexcluding\nthe PRC\nand Japan\n21.6%\n\nASEAN\n16.0%\n\nUnited States\n15.6%\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \nEU\u00a0=\u00a0European Union, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 12 March 2019).\n\n3.28.12\u2002Labor productivity in agriculture\n\n5 -year \n\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nThailand\nViet Nam\n\nIndex, 2000 = 100\n\n220\n\n180\n\n140\n\n100\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\nNote: Data are based on constant 2010 $.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from World \nDevelopment Indicators online database \n(accessed\u00a015\u00a0March 2019).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nPhilippines\u2002\u2002293\n\nThese include trade restrictions on some agricultural products, \nnotably rice; inadequate extension services to farmers; poor \nwater resource management; and underinvestment in rural \ninfrastructure. \n\nThe implementation of the 2019 law liberalizing the trading \nof rice is a major first step toward improving farm productivity \nand incomes. The law replaces quantitative restrictions \non rice imports with tariffs, which should help stabilize \ndomestic rice prices. It also restructures the National Food \nAuthority, notably by transferring its main functions to other \ngovernment agencies, and establishes the Rice Competitiveness \nEnhancement Fund, financed with revenue from tariffs on rice \nimports. The fund aims to raise farm productivity by, among \nother strategies, financing the modernization of farm practices, \ndeveloping high-quality rice seed, beefing up extension \nservices, and enhancing credit to rice farmers. \n\nThe law and the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund \n\ntogether provide a unique opportunity to lift rural incomes \nby enhancing farm productivity and helping marginal rice \nfarmers to switch to cultivating higher-value crops. But more \ncan be done to enhance productivity. These include increasing \ninvestments in rural infrastructure that connect farm \ncommunities and urban growth centers, better irrigation, crop \ninsurance against typhoons and droughts, and innovation that \nwill engage the support of private sector providers of extension \nservices to farmers in the transition to higher-value crops.\nAt the same time, it is important for the government \n\nto support emerging growth industries in rural areas \nthat generate sustainable off-farm income. Tourism could \nbe a catalyst as it has significant links with agriculture, \nconstruction, and retail services. Such a transition would \nrequire further improvement of rural tourism infrastructure \nand the business climate in rural areas, as well as investment in \nskills development.\n\n\fSingapore\n\nGrowth  decelerated  in  2018  on  softening  demand,  both  external  and  internal.  Further \nmoderation  is  expected  in  2019  and  2020  as  slowdowns  in  major  trade  partners  and \nlingering  trade  tensions  tamp  down  expansion  in  export-oriented  industries  and  erode \nbusiness sentiment. Inflation will pick up slightly but remain tame, and the current account \nsurplus  will  edge  higher  on  rising  net  service  receipts.  The  introduction  of  a  carbon  tax \ndemands  policies  to  keep  affected  companies  competitive.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth moderated from 3.9% in 2017 to 3.2% in 2018 as \nexpansion in manufacturing and services slowed and domestic \ndemand weakened. Services remained the main driver of \neconomic activity, contributing 2.1 percentage points to growth. \nGrowth in manufacturing slowed from 10.4% in 2017 to 7.2% as \ndemand for electronics softened but still contributed 1.3 points \nto growth. Construction contracted by 3.4%, shaving 0.1\u00a0points \nfrom growth, owing to weakness in public construction \n(Figure\u00a03.29.1).\n\nConsumption contributed 1.2 percentage points to growth, \n\nless than in 2017, as private expenditure growth slowed in \nline with spending on transportation, and public expenditure \nalso rose modestly in line with spending on social services. \nInvestment shaved 0.4 points from growth on faltering \npublic and private construction and investment in transport \nequipment. Exports of goods and services grew by 5.2% in \nreal terms, driven largely by higher shipments of machinery \nand transport equipment. Meanwhile, imports of goods and \nservices rose by only 4.5%, leaving net exports to add 2.6 \npercentage points to GDP growth (Figure 3.29.2).\n\nConsumer price inflation eased to 0.4% in 2018 with a \ndecline in accommodation costs as rebates to households \nrose, bus and train transport costs dropped, and car prices \nmoderated. However, core inflation, which excludes \naccommodation and private transportation on land, rose by \n1.7% on steady price increases for food and for education and \nhealth care services (Figure 3.29.3).\n\n3.29.1\u2002 Supply-side contributions to growth, \n\nby industry\n\n2018\n2017\n\nManufacturing\nFinance & insurance\nBusiness services\nWholesale & retail trade\nInformation & communications\nOther services\nOwnership of dwellings\nTransportation & storage\nAccommodation & food services\nAgriculture, \ufb01shing, & quarrying\nUtilities\nConstruction\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n\n0\nPercentage points\n\nSource: Ministry of Trade and Industry.

Loans and \nadvances rose by 3.0%, less than in 2017, and money supply \ngrew by 3.9% (Figure 3.29.5).\n\nMerchandise exports increased by 12.7% in 2018 as prices \n\nfor petroleum product exports increased, though export \nvolume fell. Merchandise imports rose by 14.3%, but the trade \nsurplus still widened. As the deficit in services also narrowed \non higher net receipts from financial services, the current \naccount surplus rose to equal 17.7% of GDP. Nevertheless, \nthe overall balance of payments surplus narrowed from \nthe equivalent of 8.1% of GDP in 2017 to 3.5% as net capital \noutflows widened to $50.3 billion, equal to 13.9% of GDP \n(Figure 3.29.6).\n\nThe budget for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018, ended 31\u00a0March \n2019) recorded a surplus equal to 0.4% of GDP, though a small \ndeficit had been planned. Revenue declined by 0.5%, less than \noriginally budgeted, with lower receipts from vehicle quota \npremiums and stamp duties and reduced contributions from \nstatutory boards. Expenditure including special transfers grew \nby 10.4%, also less than originally planned, on higher transport, \nsecurity, and defense outlays (Figure 3.29.7).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is expected to moderate further to 2.6% in 2019 \nand 2020. Manufacturing and export-oriented services will \ngrow at a slower pace than last year, tamped down by a global \ngrowth slowdown and lingering trade tensions. According \nto a business expectation survey in the first quarter of 2019, \nbusiness conditions are expected to be less favorable in \nthe first half of 2019. The purchasing managers\u2019 index for \nmanufacturing edged down in February 2019, and that for \nelectronics dipped into contraction territory (Figure 3.29.8). \nNevertheless, modern services\u2014which include business \nservices, finance, and information and communication \ntechnology\u2014will continue to drive growth this year and \nnext, buttressed by government support for digitalization. \nConstruction looks likely to recover in 2019, as public sector \ncontracts rose substantially in late 2018.\n\nInvestment growth will accelerate in 2019 on recovery \n\nin construction and plans by the Economic Development \nBoard of Singapore to attract more than S$10 billion in fixed \nasset investment. Low unemployment and tightening supply \nof foreign workers will push up real wages and encourage \nhousehold spending, while government consumption will \n\n3.29.3\u2002 Monthly inflation\n\nHeadline\nCore\nFood\n\n% change year on year\n4\n\nTransportation\n\n% change year on year\n8\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 5 March 2019).\n\n3.29.4\u2002Exchange rates\n\nNominal effective\n\nNominal\n\n1999 = 100\n\nS$/US$\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 5 March 2019).\n\n3.29.5\u2002Financial indicators\n\nLoans\nMoney supply (M2)\n\nSingapore interbank\noffered rate\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2019).\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n128\n\n126\n\n124\n\n122\n\n120\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n%\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\f296(cid:4)(cid:4)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nInflation is projected to edge up to 0.7% in 2019 and 0.9% \n\n3.29.6\u2002 Balance of payments\n\nrise with more spending on social services and security. \nJanuary\u00a02019 data show exports of both oil and other products, \nnotably machinery and transport equipment, declining in real \nterms, though lower exports were cushioned by increased \nre-exports. Imports too are expected to grow at a slower pace \nin 2019, generating a modest rise in net exports.\n\nA budget deficit equal to 0.7% of GDP is planned for \n\nFY2019.

In January 2019, headline inflation eased to 0.4% \nyear on year and core inflation to 1.7% year on year. However, \ninflationary pressure will intensify this year and the\u00a0next. \nA\u00a0higher private residential property price index in the \nfourth quarter of 2018 indicated rising accommodation costs. \nA\u00a0carbon\u00a0tax will come into effect, wages could rise as reliance \non foreign workers becomes more restricted, and education \nand health care costs and license fees on car ownership are \nset to increase. However, with core inflation still within \nthe forecast range of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, \nmonetary policy will likely be unchanged at least for the \nremainder of 2019. \n\nThe trade account is forecast in surplus in both 2019 and \n2020, though imports are expected to grow faster than exports. \nIn January 2019, export growth softened to 1.0% year on year, \nwhile imports grew by 8.0%, but the trade balance remained \nin surplus. The deficit in services is expected to narrow as net \npayments for imports of business and transport services fall, \nand as net receipts from the use of intellectual property and \nfinancial services increase. On balance, the current account \nsurplus is projected to remain stable at the equivalent of 17.8% \nof GDP in 2019 and 2020. \n\n3.29.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n\u20022.6\n\n\u20020.7\n\n17.8\n\n\u20022.6\n\n\u20020.9\n\n17.8\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nCapital and \ufb01nancial account balance\nCurrent account balance\nOverall balance\n\n% of  GDP\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Ministry of Trade and Industry.

To this end, Singapore introduced a carbon tax \non\u00a0carbon dioxide emissions, effective from 2019, making it \nthe\u00a0first economy in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nto do so.\n\nThe carbon tax applies to large emitters and has directly \naffected the businesses, as many as 40 of them, that contribute \nmore than 80% of emissions (Figure 3.29.9). The tax is \nexpected to encourage the transition to energy-efficient \noperations, set the stage for future platforms for emissions \ntrading, and generate revenues estimated at $1 billion in the \nfirst 5 years, which the government intends to use to help \ncompanies innovate and improve their energy efficiency. \nMeanwhile, though, there is a risk that the carbon tax could \nmake affected businesses less competitive than peers that \nare not subject to the tax\u2014a risk exacerbated by volatile oil \nprices. The authorities now face the challenge of balancing \nobjectives for controlling emissions with those for sustaining \ncompetitiveness and economic growth.\n\nto increase gradually, starting at S$5 per ton of carbon \ndioxide\u00a0during the transition phase of 2019\u20132023, then rising \nto S$10\u2013S$15 per ton following an assessment in 2023 of its \nimpact. Gradual implementation and intense competition \namong energy\u00a0supply companies should make it unlikely that \nthe carbon tax will be passed on to consumers through higher \nelectricity prices. \n\nTo ensure that the carbon tax is effective in the subsequent \n\nphase of implementation\u2014when more information on energy \nemissions will be available and more companies will become \nsubject to the tax\u2014a carbon emissions trading system can \nbe introduced. For this purpose, the government should set \ngradually stricter annual ceilings both for aggregate pollution \nfrom all industries and for company-specific emissions. \nCompanies can then be allowed to trade their emissions. \nThis\u00a0will provide more flexibility to larger polluters, as they \nstrive to bring down their emissions in an orderly fashion, \nwhile ensuring that the aggregate emission ceiling is not \nbreached. During this phase, the carbon tax can be extended \nto the transportation industry, which the government forecasts \nwill be second only to industry as a source of carbon pollution \nby 2020.\n\n3.29.8\u2002Purchasing managers\u2019 index\n\nManufacturing\nElectronics\n\nIndex\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2019). \n\nIndustry (energy use)\n\nEnergy and transformation \nindustries\n\nTransport\n\nIndustry\n(fugitive emissions)\n\nCommercial-institutional\n\nResidential\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n% of total energy emissions\n\nSource: National Environment Agency. 2018. \nFourth\u00a0National Communication and Third Biennial \nUpdate Report (accessed 1 March 2019).\n\nReflecting this concern, the carbon tax is scheduled \n\n3.29.9\u2002 Emissions by sector, 2014\n\n\fThailand\n\nHigher  domestic  demand  more  than  offset  moderation  in  exports  to  drive  economic \ngrowth  higher  in  2018.  In  a  weakening  external  environment,  growth  is  likely  to  fall  back \nto  its  2017  rate  this  year  and  a  bit  lower  next  year.  Inflation  will  continue  to  be  benign, \nand  current  account  surpluses  will  remain  substantial  even  as  they  shrink.  Strengthening \nThailand\u2019s  economic  links  with  its  close  neighbors  can  add  impetus  to  growth  in  the \nmedium  term. \n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth rose from 4.0% in 2017 to 4.1% in 2018 on higher \ndomestic demand and despite weaker export growth, as volume \ngrowth in exports of goods and services moderated from \n5.4% in 2017 to 4.2% last year (Figure 3.30.1). Growth in the \nUS dollar value of merchandise exports slipped from 9.8% in \n2017 to 7.7% as external demand softened. While lower prices \ncaused a 23.6% reduction in earnings from rubber exports, a \nslowdown in global electronics trade dragged manufacturing \nexport growth down from 10.2% in 2017 to 8.4%. \n\nOn the domestic front, both consumption and investment \n\npicked up. Buoyed by improved domestic conditions, low \ninflation, and continued government support for low-income \nhouseholds, private consumption grew by 4.6% in 2018, more \nthan half again the 3.0% rise in 2017. Retail sales continued \nto be robust, with the retail sales index rising from 6.3% in \n2017 to 10.8%. Domestic investment rose by a hefty 16.9% on \ntop of a 14.1% increase in 2017. In tandem with a recovery in \nprivate investment that began in 2017 and gathered strength \nlast year, public investment, buoyed by the implementation of \nseveral public infrastructure projects, grew by 3.3%, reversing \na decline in 2017. \n\nExcepting services, growth in 2018 improved on 2017 across \n\nthe board. Favorable weather helped growth in agriculture \nimprove from 3.7% in 2017 to 5.0% (Figure 3.30.2). Industry \ngrowth rose from 2.2% in 2017 to 2.7%, and construction \nstaged a turnaround from 2.8% contraction in 2017 to 2.7% \ngrowth last year on accelerated implementation of public \ninfrastructure projects. Meanwhile, softening international \ntourist arrivals slowed growth in services from 5.8% in 2017 \nto 5.1% in 2018, when the service sector nevertheless provided \nalmost three-fourths of GDP growth.\n\nThis chapter was written by Thiam Hee Ng of the Southeast Asia Department, \nADB, Manila.\n\n3.30.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nInvestment\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n1.0\n\n3.4\n\n4.0\n\n3.1\n\n4.1\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Office of the National Economic and Social \nDevelopment Council. http://www.nesdb.go.th \n(accessed\u00a01\u00a0March 2019).\n\n3.30.2\u2002 Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.5\n\n5.0\n\n2.5\n\n0.0\n\n-2.5\n\n-5.0\n\n4.5\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n\n-1.5\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Office of the National Economic and Social \nDevelopment Council. http://www.nesdb.go.th \n(accessed\u00a01\u00a0March 2019).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand\u2002\u2002299\n\nTourism took some hits in 2018. In July, bad weather \ncaused a ferry carrying tourists from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) to capsize near Phuket, killing all 47 passengers \non board. The World Cup in June and July is blamed for \ndiverting European tourists away from Thailand and to the \nRussian Federation. In any case, tourist arrivals slumped \nin the third quarter, prompting the government to step up \ntourism promotion and grant a temporary waiver, to the end \nof April 2019, on the fee for visa on arrival. International \ntourist arrivals showed signs of recovery in the fourth quarter \nand grew by 7.9% in the whole year to reach 38.3 million \n(Figure\u00a03.30.3).\n\nAs growth picked up and international oil prices rose last \nyear, inflation accelerated from 0.7% in 2017 to 1.1%, though it \nbegan to ease again in the fourth quarter as international oil \nprices softened (Figure 3.30.4). Food price inflation remained \nmuted as higher agriculture growth ensured ample supply. \n\nThe trade surplus narrowed sharply from the equivalent \nof 7.5% of GDP in 2017 to 4.7% (Figure 3.30.5). While growth \nin merchandise exports slowed in US dollar terms from 9.8% \nin 2017 to 7.7%, that of merchandise imports accelerated from \n13.2% to 14.3%, mostly on higher imports of consumer goods to \nmeet demand as private expenditure rose. Net export receipts \nfor services were marginally lower as well. The result was a \nsmaller current account surplus, equal to 7.5% of GDP. \n\nThe financial account recorded a deficit of $21.6 billion, \nreflecting mostly rising investment overseas by investors based \nin Thailand. The surplus in the overall balance of payments \nthus plunged by three-quarters, from the equivalent 5.7% of \nGDP in 2017 to 1.4% last year. International reserves continued \nto climb, reaching $205.6 billion at the end of 2018, which \nwas cover for 8.7 months of imports or 3.3 times the country\u2019s \nshort-term foreign debt. With a still-comfortable balance of \npayments and ample international reserves, the Thai baht \nappreciated by 4.8% against the US dollar in 2018. \n\nThe Bank of Thailand, the central bank, raised its policy \nrate in December 2018, for the first time in 11 years, by 25 basis \npoints to 1.75%. This was primarily a preemptive measure \nto maintain financial stability and to build space in the rate \nfor any reductions needed later if global economic conditions \ndeteriorate. \n\nFiscal policy remained broadly supportive to growth as the \ndeficit for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018, ended 30 September 2018) \nequaled 2.5% of GDP, only slightly down from 2.7% in FY2017 \n(Figure 3.30.6). Actual government expenditure came to 94.5% \nof the budget, while revenue lagged at 82.4% of the budget. \nPublic debt remained sustainable at the equivalent of 41.9% of \nGDP, of which foreign debt accounted for less than 2%. \n\n3.30.3\u2002 Tourism indicators\n\nNumber of tourists\n\nTourist arrival growth\n\nMillion visitors\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th \n(accessed\u00a013 March 2019).\n\n3.30.4\u2002 Inflation and policy interest rate\n\nPolicy interest rate\n\nOverall in\ufb02ation\nCore in\ufb02ation\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSources: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th; \nCEIC\u00a0Data Company (both accessed 13 March 2019).\n\n3.30.5\u2002 Trade indicators\n\n Trade balance\n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n%\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n$ billion\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n%\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th \n(accessed\u00a01\u00a0March 2019).\n\n\f300(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nEconomic prospects \nSlowing global growth and a lingering trade conflict between \nthe PRC and the US will dim export prospects. Following \nbumper harvests in 2018, growth in agriculture and allied \nbusinesses is likely to return to the long-term trend. \nAlthough\u00a0domestic consumption and investment should \nhold\u00a0up, GDP\u00a0growth is expected to revert to 3.9% in 2019 and \nslow a bit more to 3.7% in 2020 (Figure 3.30.7). \n\nDomestic consumption is forecast to stay robust as upbeat \n\nconsumer sentiment endures, as reflected in the consumer \nconfidence index. Low unemployment\u2014at 0.9% most recently, \nin the last quarter of 2018\u2014should buttress consumer spending, \nas will continued government assistance to low-income \nhouseholds. That said, high household debt and a recent \ntightening of macroprudential policy will likely hold consumer \nspending back from significant acceleration. \n\nDomestic investment is projected to sustain last \nyear\u2019s growth rate as the implementation of large public \ninfrastructure projects proceeds. Budgetary capital outlays in \nFY2019 have so far increased by 19.9%. As of February\u00a02019, \n20 public infrastructure investment projects with a combined \nbudget of nearly $23 billion had reached their construction \nphase. With construction in progress, budgetary disbursements \nare expected to smooth out. Moreover, several new \ninfrastructure projects connected to the Eastern Economic \nCorridor\u2014a massive government-led development program \nin the provinces of Chachoengsao, Chonburi, and Rayong\u2014\nhave recently received cabinet approval and could begin \nimplementation by the middle of 2019. \n\nPrivate investment also looks positive, buoyed by broadly \n\nstable business sentiment.

Recent bilateral tariff hikes between the PRC and the US \ncould adversely affect exports from Thailand, given its role as \na major supplier of intermediate goods in global value chains. \nSeparately, the downturn in the global electronics cycle may \nhinder exports of electronics and electrical appliances. \n\nGrowth in merchandise imports is forecast to outpace \nexports as imports rise to support the rollout of the large \ninfrastructure projects. The merchandise trade surplus is thus \nexpected to narrow. Net exports of services should continue in \nsurplus as growth in international tourist arrivals returns to \ntrend following last year\u2019s temporary setback. The net result is \nlikely to be a somewhat narrower current account surplus equal \nto 7.0% of GDP in 2019 and 2020 (Figure 3.30.9). With foreign \ndirect investment and portfolio inflows both remaining stable, \nthe overall balance of payments should remain comfortable, as \nshould international currency reserves. \n\nAs growth slows, fiscal policy is expected to stay \naccommodative this year and next, with spending on \npublic infrastructure continuing to accelerate and project \nimplementation requiring faster budgetary disbursement. \nThe\u00a0budget for FY2019 calls for a fiscal deficit of B450 billion, \nequal to 2.6% of GDP, with a similar fiscal deficit planned for \nFY2020.\n\nWith slower growth, low and stable inflation, and a \ncomfortable balance of payments, monetary policy will \ncontinue to be accommodative. The central bank is unlikely to \nraise rates in 2019. In fact, after the increase in December 2018, \nit has room to ease monetary policy if the economy slows more \nthan expected and deemed tolerable. \n\nThe main external risk to the outlook is any escalation in \nthe trade conflict between the PRC and the US. An unexpected \ndelay in implementing infrastructure investment projects is a \ndomestic risk, as are adverse weather that could affect farm \nproduction and damage the rural economy. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening economic \nlinks with close neighbors\nThailand has long benefited from being an open economy. \nIt\u00a0has prospered as a hub in the regional production network \nand in global value chains, making foreign trade a major \ncontributor historically to its economic growth. Building on \nthis success, Thailand can benefit by further strengthening \nits economic links with its close neighbors through trade, \ninvestment, and technology transfer. This would allow it to \nshift to a higher position in the regional production network \nand in global value chains\u2014an ambition enunciated under the \nThailand 4.0 development strategy. \n\n\f302(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nEncouragingly, Thailand is surrounded by dynamic, fast \ngrowing neighbors: Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. These countries are \nquickly climbing the development ladder, and their demand \nfor consumer goods is likely to accelerate. Thailand is well \nplaced to meet this demand. Already, recent trends reveal the \ngrowing importance of these neighbors as trade partners for \nThailand, with their share of Thai exports nearly quadrupling \nfrom about 3% in 1995 to almost 12% in 2018 (Figure 3.30.10). \nThese\u00a0exports are expected to continue to grow as trade ties \nfurther strengthen. \n\nThese four economies have been destinations not just \n\nfor Thai exports but also for Thai private investment \n(Figure\u00a03.30.11). Such investment has grown quickly, \nconcentrated in energy and transportation infrastructure. \n\nLooking ahead, potential exists for Thailand to invest more \n\nin its neighbors\u2019 manufacturing sectors. Channeling foreign \ndirect investment into its neighbors could be one solution to \nThailand\u2019s worsening shortage of skilled workers at home as \nits population ages, even as investment augments the capital \nsupply and technological knowhow available to its neighbors. \nIn contrast with Thailand\u2019s shrinking pool of young workers \nable and willing to take factories jobs, Thailand\u2019s neighbors \nboast young and growing populations eager to enter the \nworkforce. \n\nThailand can use its long experience in global value chains \nto guide the integration of its neighbors into these production \nnetworks. Improving transport links can further cement \ncloser trade ties and better integrate these economies with \nthe regional production network and global value chains. \nThe main hurdles to further integration are bottlenecks and \ndelays at border crossings. A recent study for the Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development found that \nSoutheast\u00a0Asia could reap large gains by expeditiously \nimplementing trade facilitation. By improving transportation \nlinks and streamlining border formalities, Thailand could \nbetter integrate itself and its neighbors into the regional \nproduction network and global supply chains.\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n%\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3.30.10\u2002 Average annual growth of \nThai\u00a0exports, 2007\u20132018\n\nCAM MYA VIE LAO INO PHI MAL BRU SIN\n\nBRU = Brunei Darussalam, CAM = Cambodia, \nINO\u00a0=\u00a0Indonesia, LAO =Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, MAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia, MYA = Myanmar, \nPHI\u00a0=\u00a0Philippines, THA\u00a0= Singapore, VIE = Viet Nam.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 March 2019).\n\n3.30.11\u2002 Average annual growth in \n\noutward\u00a0FDI stock, 2007\u20132017\n\nLAO INO VIE SIN MAL CAM MYA PHI BRU\n\nBRU = Brunei Darussalam, CAM = Cambodia, \nFDI\u00a0=\u00a0foreign direct investment, INO = Indonesia, \nLAO\u00a0=\u00a0Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nMAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia, MYA\u00a0=\u00a0Myanmar, PHI = Philippines, \nTHA\u00a0= Singapore, VIE\u00a0= Viet\u00a0Nam.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 March 2019).\n\n\fViet Nam\n\nStrong  exports  and  domestic  demand  pushed  GDP  growth  higher  in  2018  than  in  more \nthan  a  decade.

Solid growth in exports of goods and services and \ncontinued strength in domestic demand underpinned last year\u2019s \nexpansion. Private consumption, the largest component of GDP, \naccounted for most of GDP growth last year (Figure 3.31.1).\nAlthough growth in exports of goods and services \n\nmoderated from 16.7% in 2017 to 14.3% last year, net exports \nexpanded by 9.2%. Strong external demand thus gave a \nbig boost to Viet Nam\u2019s highly trade-dependent economy. \nMerchandise exports rose by 13.8%, with exports of telephones \nand accessories, which now account for a fifth of merchandise \nexports, rising by 11.0%. \n\nDomestic demand held up well, though moderating from \n\n7.3% in 2017 to 7.2% last year. Rising incomes and stable \ninflation underpinned a strong rise in private consumption. \nGrowth in gross investment slowed from 9.8% in 2017 to \n8.2%.

Industry and \nconstruction contributed nearly half of GDP growth last year \nwith improved mining output and continued momentum in \nmanufacturing driven by increases in the export-oriented \nsectors: telecommunications, electronics, and textiles. \nGrowth in services moderated from 7.4% in 2017 to 7.0%, with \nwholesale and retail trade the strongest segment, up by 8.5%. \nInternational tourist arrivals rose by a fifth (Figure 3.31.3). \nEncouragingly, stronger growth did not cause much \ninflationary pressure. Inflation averaged 3.5% in 2018, as \nin 2017 and below the official target of 4.0% (Figure 3.31.4). \nCore inflation averaged 1.5%, little changed from the previous \nyear. While higher costs for medical services, education, and \ntransportation contributed to inflationary pressure in the \nfirst 10 months of the year, pressure was eased by a decline in \ninternational oil prices, the government\u2019s decision to postpone \na planned hike in electricity tariffs, and tighter monetary \nconditions. \n\nThe external position strengthened. The current account \ncontinued to post a surplus, up from the equivalent of 2.9% of \nGDP in 2017 to an estimated 3.0%, supported by a $7 billion \ntrade surplus and stable service receipts. Sizeable FDI and \nportfolio capital inflows pushed the estimated surplus in \nthe capital account to the equivalent of 6.0% of GDP. Data \nfrom the General Statistics Office show that registered \nforeign investment reached $35.5 billion in 2018, including an \nestimated $25.5 billion in new FDI commitments. Inflows of \nforeign equity investment reached an estimated $10 billion, \nreflecting positive sentiment among foreign investors. \n\nSurpluses in the current and capital accounts added up to \nan overall balance of payments surplus estimated to equal 5% \nof GDP. The strengthened external position improved foreign \nreserves from a low 2.7 months of import cover at the end of \n2017 to an estimated 3.0 months a year later. \n\nBudgetary expenditure growth was sharply down from \n17.1% in 2017 to an estimated 10.5% last year. Growth in current \nexpenditure slowed from 11.6% in 2017 to 8.7% as discretionary \nspending was contained. Budget revenue growth slowed from \n11.9% in 2017 to 9.6% in 2018. The on-budget fiscal deficit \nexpanded marginally from the equivalent of 3.5% of GDP in \n2017 to an estimated 3.7% (Figure 3.31.5). Strong economic \ngrowth helped the government to contain public debt at the \nequivalent of 61.4% of GDP at the end of 2018, down from its \npeak of 63.7% in 2016 and comfortably below the statutory cap \nof 65.0%.\n\nInflationary pressures eased at year-end, but as they built \nin the first 10 months of 2018, growth in credit and the money \nsupply (M2) was controlled with stricter limits applied on \ncommercial banks\u2019 credit growth and stricter regulations on \nlending in high-risk areas such as real estate and securities. \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n3.31.3\u2002 Tourist arrivals\n\nMillion arrivals\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nSource: General Statistics Office of Viet Nam.\n\n3.31.4\u2002 Monthly inflation\n\n% change year on year\n\n12-month moving average\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSource: General Statistics Office of Viet Nam.\n\n3.31.5\u2002 Fiscal balance \n\nRevenue\nExpenditure\n\nFiscal balance\n\n% change year on year\n\n% of GDP\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Data exclude off-budget spending and on-lending.\nSource: Ministry of Finance.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nViet Nam\u2002\u2002305\n\nEstimated growth in credit was contained at 14.0% and in \nmoney supply at 12.0%, the lowest growth for both since 2015 \n(Figure 3.31.6).

The value of \nall trade to and from Viet Nam is now twice its GDP, and FDI \ninflow in 2018 equaled 8% of GDP. Viet Nam is a signatory \nto 12 free trade agreements that integrate the economy into \nglobal\u00a0value chains (GVCs). However, participation in GVCs \nhas been driven largely by foreign-owned firms. Domestic \nprivate\u00a0firms in Viet Nam are predominantly small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In 2017, more than half a \nmillion domestic SMEs contributed nearly half of GDP, but \nhardly any participated in GVCs (Figure 3.31.11).\n\nThe uneven quality of products and services offered by \ndomestic SMEs is the main constraint on their integration into \nGVCs. This is particularly problematic as international markets \ntighten their technical, quarantine, environmental, and health \nstandards. SMEs have little access to new technologies that \nwould help them overcome these barriers. A World Bank \nEnterprise Survey found that SMEs in Viet Nam approached \nproduct innovation primarily as a way to reduce costs, not to \nimprove product quality. In addition, few SMEs purchase or \nlicense newer technologies developed elsewhere. \n\nIndeed, SMEs in Viet Nam suffer many constraints. \nTheir\u00a0capacity to purchase and adapt newer technologies \nis restricted by limited access to finance and a shortage of \nworkers with the necessary skills. Affordable financing is often \nout of reach because of banks\u2019 stringent collateral requirements \nand complicated procedures, and because capital markets are \ninsufficient, despite the existence of multiple mechanisms \nto provide finance to SMEs: the SME Development Fund, \ncommercial banks, credit guarantee funds, and the Viet\u00a0Nam \nDevelopment Bank, among others. Regarding the shortage \nof skills, a recent survey by ManpowerGroup showed that \nonly 11% of firms in Viet Nam can provide the skills required \nfor GVC participation. Yet the \u201clow cost, low skills\u201d era of \nViet\u00a0Nam\u2019s development is over, and Viet Nam must become a \nhigher-skilled economy. \n\nTo address the underlining causes of uneven product \nquality, policy should encourage and support the adoption of \nnew technology and, eventually, domestic innovation.

Inflation rose, and the current account deficit expanded. Growth \nwill accelerate further in 2019 and 2020 as inflation and the current account deficit ease. \nGovernment  policies  supporting  tourism  growth  need  to  ensure  that  development  is \nappropriate  and  sustainable.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy grew by 3.0% in 2018 with contributions from \nagriculture, forestry, and construction, and particularly with \ncontinued growth in tourist arrivals (Figure 3.32.1). Despite\u00a0two \ncyclones that caused flooding, sugarcane production increased \nto 1.7 million tons, up by 4.0% from 2017, though cane quality \nsuffered and milling efficiency declined. Timber harvested \nfrom pine and mahogany plantations increased substantially \nfor higher forestry output. Gold\u00a0production declined, but food, \nbeverages, tobacco, sawmilling, and the manufacture of wood \nproducts all experienced growth. \n\nPrivate construction grew strongly in 2018 with increased \n\nnew construction augmenting maintenance and repair. \nVisitor\u00a0arrivals grew by 3.3%, bringing tourism earnings to \nthe equivalent of 20% of GDP and boosting employment in the \nindustry (Figure 3.32.2). Japan contributed the most to this \nincrease with the resumption of direct flights. Visitor arrivals \nwere higher as well from Europe, New Zealand, and other parts \nof Asia, notably the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nDespite frequent disasters, economic growth in Fiji has \nbeen uninterrupted since 2010. In 2018, the national statistics \noffice increased its estimate of growth for 2016 but reduced the \nestimate for 2017.\n\nConsumption continued to grow in 2018, with new vehicle \n\nsales up by 7.2%, second-hand vehicle sales up by 11.5%, and \ncollections of value-added tax up by 6.1%. Commercial bank \nlending for consumption grew by 9.2%. \n\nInflation rose to 4.1% in 2018, the largest category increase \nbeing beverages, tobacco, and other intoxicants mainly because of \nhigher duties on alcohol and tobacco but also because production \nof kava declined. Prices for food and nonalcoholic beverage rose \nby 3.4%.

All sectors are \nexpected to grow, with tourism in the lead, but construction \nwill likely contribute substantially, considering high bank \nlending for real estate and the number of projects in progress. \nTourism will continue to drive growth higher to 3.5% in 2020, \nwith other contributors also strong. Growth forecasts assume \nthat public resources will go into productive investments \nin infrastructure, but growth is unlikely to reach the trend \nthat existed before Cyclone\u00a0Winston in 2016 because the \ngovernment plans to ensure that public debt does not exceed \nthe government-set ceiling equal to 50.0% of GDP. \n\nPlanned investments in transportation and in water \n\nsupply and sanitation in the greater Suva area are expected to \ncontribute to growth in construction over the medium term. \nIn addition, public investment in flood control structures in \nurban areas of Nadi should improve confidence in the tourism \nindustry and encourage more investment.\n\nexports with significant domestic value added.

Visitor \narrivals in Fiji have increased from 2010 to 2018 at an average \nannual rate of 5.5%. With tourism earnings now providing a \nfifth of GDP, the business is central to employment, incomes, \nand\u00a0poverty reduction. More\u00a0tourists now insist on authentic \ncultural experiences and pristine nature, which is likely to \ncontinue benefiting Fiji in the future.\n\nAs Fiji\u2019s tourism industry depends crucially on the \nenvironment, any degradation threatens to undermine\u00a0it. \nTourism growth needs to be managed to minimize its \nenvironmental impacts. As the industry matures and moves into \na more complex phase of development, greater coordination of \npolicy and the regulatory environment will become necessary \nto ensure both maximal development impact and continuing \nsustainability. Fijian Tourism 2021, which provides a cohesive \ntourism strategy and plan, is a step in the right direction. \nHowever, the formulation and implementation of a broader \nsustainable development framework is still critically needed, as is \nthe implementation of Fiji\u2019s Green Growth Framework and better \ncompliance with existing environmental laws and policies. \n\nIn addition to public sector efforts to improve planning and \nregulations, Fiji needs an environment conducive to appropriate \nprivate investment and commitment to sustainable tourism \ninitiatives. Finally, public infrastructure must do more than \nfacilitate private investment. It must be able to withstand the \nimpacts of climate change and heightened weather variability.\n\n\fPapua New Guinea\n\nAn  earthquake  disrupted  production  from  major  resource  projects  in  2018,  slowing  growth. \nHowever,  economic  circumstances  improved  with  higher  commodity  prices,  easier  access \nto  foreign  exchange,  and  the  government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  fiscal  consolidation. \nInflation eased, and the current account posted another large surplus. Sustained adoption of \nmarket-orientated policies and ongoing structural reform are needed to attract foreign capital. \n\nEconomic performance\nA large earthquake in February 2018 undermined growth, \nestimated at 0.2%, but the impact was somewhat mitigated \nby higher commodity prices, activity associated with the \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in \nPort Moresby in November 2018, and reconstruction in the \nearthquake-affected zone. Credit to the private sector picked \nup by about\u00a07% in 2018, and employment ceased to decline. \nThe\u00a0availability of foreign currency improved with greater \ninflows, though private businesses continued to be stymied by \ndelays in accessing it.\n\nThe oil and gas industry, which constitutes 20.2% of GDP, \n\n3.33.1\u2002 Contributions to growth\n\ncontracted in 2018 primarily because of damaged facilities \nand lost output caused by the earthquake. Output of liquefied \nnatural gas (LNG), which provides an estimated 14.9% of GDP, \nfell by 8.8% in 2018.

Production from \nthe Lihir mine, which has the third-largest reserves of gold \nin the world, grew by 6.2% in 2018, with total output equal \nto 5.0% of GDP. Production from some medium-sized mines, \nincluding the Kainantu gold mine, was also higher in 2018. \nAn estimated 80,000 small-scale alluvial miners increased \nproduction by over 7% in 2018, earning combined revenues of \nabout $120\u00a0million.\n\nThe economy apart from mining and petroleum is \n\nestimated to have grown by 3.1% in 2018.

Higher government \nspending and the improved availability of foreign exchange \nalso supported growth. \n\nThe agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector, which \nmakes up about 17.0% of GDP, had mixed results in 2018. \nFarm\u00a0production, including vegetables and fruit for the \ndomestic market, continued to expand steadily on increased \ndemand from population growth and with improved access \nto markets thanks to new infrastructure such as roads and \nbridges. Palm oil is the largest agricultural export, providing \n1.3% of GDP, but export volume in 2018 fell below that of 2017 \nbecause of a carryover effect from the 2016 El Ni\u00f1o event. \nCocoa production was lower in 2018, but coffee production \nwas higher. Forest products, largely logs for export, increased \nin\u00a02018. \n\nmore readily available and the money supply contracted \n(Figure\u00a03.33.2). Prices for food, betel nut, and beverages, which \nhad earlier spiked under drought, increased only slightly \nin\u00a02018. However, higher oil prices pushed up transportation \ncosts. Prices for health care increased by 9.0% in 2018, and for \nclothing and footwear by 8.3%. Hotel and restaurant prices \nrose by 8.2%, largely because of the APEC summit.\n\nThe Bank of Papua New Guinea, the central bank, \nmaintained a neutral monetary policy in 2018, with the \nmain policy rate, called the kina facility rate, maintained at \n6.25%, a slight premium over the rate of inflation. There is no \ntransmission of the policy rate to banks\u2019 lending or deposit \nrates because commercial banks can source cheap local \ncurrency deposits. This largely reflects excess liquidity arising \nin part from a tough lending environment. Although there is \nample liquidity in the system, broad money contracted by 8% \nin 2018 as statutory authorities transferred their deposits from \nbanks into government coffers in accordance with revenue \nreform measures.\n\nThe current account posted a large surplus in 2018 equal \nto 26.7% of GDP (Figure 3.33.3). Oil and gas prices lifted the \nsurplus and helped to overcome the effects of the earthquake. \nLNG exports were the largest contributor to the surplus. \nForeign currency reserves increased by 33.6% to $2.3\u00a0billion \nat the end of 2018, providing cover for 11.6 months of imports. \nThe main source was $940 million in new external sovereign \nborrowing.\n\nGovernment revenue increased by 16.3% in 2018, benefiting \n\nfrom improved tax compliance and higher collections of \nmining and petroleum taxes and dividends with the rise in \ncommodity prices (Figure 3.33.4).

In its supplementary budget, the Department of Treasury \nprojected the 2018 fiscal deficit at the equivalent of 2.3% of \nGDP, in line with the government\u2019s strategy to reduce the fiscal \ndeficit, but the final outcome is expected to be slightly higher. \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is projected to rebound in 2019 with a return to a \nfull year of production of gold, LNG, oil, and condensate. \nLNG production is forecast to expand by 9%\u201316% in 2019. \nIf\u00a0production reaches the higher end of this range, the growth \nforecast may need to be revised upward. Condensate and \noil production are similarly expected to rebound in 2019, \nthough oil production is on a declining trend and condensate \nproduction is forecast to start falling by 2020. Gold output \nshould expand in 2019 as the Porgera mine enjoys a full year of \nuninterrupted production.\n\nrebounds to the kind of output achieved in 2017. Fisheries \nare expected to grow steadily, and forestry may also expand, \nthough a proposed ban on log exports may be introduced \nin\u00a02020, causing production to fall. Coffee, cocoa, and copra \nwill continue to experience volatility in production year on \nyear because of weather variation and changes in global \ncommodity prices.\n\nA number of major resource projects are set to drive growth \n\nin the medium term. The Papua LNG project and the PNG \nLNG expansion project together are forecast to attract foreign \ndirect investment in excess of $10 billion, with construction \nexpected to commence in 2020. The forecast period should \nalso see construction start on the $2.8 billion Wafi-Golpu gold \nand copper mine project. A telecommunication fiber optics \ncable connecting Port Moresby with Sydney is scheduled for \ncompletion toward the end of 2019 and has the potential to \nsignificantly increase internet speed and reduce costs, which \nshould facilitate business growth.\n\nInflation is expected to ease slightly in 2019 as foreign \nexchange becomes more available and following the recent \ncontraction in the money supply. In 2020, inflation is expected \nto pick up again with the commencement of new resource \nprojects.\n\nThe current account surplus is expected to shrink \nsomewhat as oil and gas prices sink below those of 2018. \nImports should pick up with the greater availability of foreign \nexchange. In 2020, imports should rise even more rapidly as \nconstruction begins on new projects, further shrinking the \ncurrent account surplus. The new resource projects will attract \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nPapua New Guinea\u2002317\n\nsignificant inflows of foreign exchange, finally ending the era \nof foreign currency shortages.\n\nThe 2019 budget targets a fiscal deficit equal to 2.1% of \nGDP, which aligns with the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation \nstrategy. Targets become progressively lower, with the 2022 \ndeficit intended to equal 1.0% of GDP. Revenue including grants \nis forecast at 16.1% of GDP in the 2019 budget and is seen to \nincrease by 6.5% largely through ongoing reform, including \nthe recent establishment of an office dedicated to handling \nlarge tax payers. Mining and petroleum taxes and dividends, \nwhich are forecast to equal 2.1% of GDP, assume an oil price of \n$68\u00a0per barrel, meaning that a lower average oil price would \ncause revenue to fall below expectations, possibly widening \nthe fiscal deficit or forcing cuts to expenditure, which is \nforecast to equal 18.2% of GDP. The government\u2019s expenditure \nstrategy would reallocate spending from current to capital \nexpenditure, which aligns with the government\u2019s Medium \nTerm Development Plan\u00a03, 2018\u20132022 to increase spending \non infrastructure. The\u00a02019 budget seeks to reduce current \nexpenditure, including the public sector wage bill, but this may \nprove to be challenging.\n\nThe deficit will be financed by external borrowing, \n\nincluding budget support loans from multilateral institutions \nand proceeds from a 2018 sovereign bond. External debt has \nbeen on the rise in recent years, projected by the Department \nof Treasury to reach the equivalent of 13.6% of GDP by\u00a02020, \nwhen it will be 44.8% of total central government debt \n(Figure\u00a03.33.5). \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014resolving foreign \ncurrency shortages\nShortages of foreign currency have been a key constraint on the \nprivate sector in recent years, with importers having to queue \nto receive foreign currency, sometimes for several weeks until \nit becomes available. These circumstances have dragged on the \neconomy. Business surveys found foreign currency shortages to \nbe among the worst impediments to doing business.\n\nFrom January 2010 to June 2012, during the construction \nof PNG LNG and a period of buoyant commodity prices, large \ninflows of foreign currency caused significant appreciation of \nthe kina, by 33% in real terms (Figure 3.33.6). Central bank \nreserves grew accordingly, from $2 billion in 2007 to over \n$4\u00a0billion in 2012.\n\nThis trend reversed in 2012 as PNG LNG construction \n\nended and commodity prices began to slide.

The central bank reported \nthat the waiting time to clear foreign exchange orders was \nshortened in 2018 as pending foreign exchange orders fell \nby 48% from K2.5 billion in January 2018 to K1.3 billion in \nJanuary 2019. \n\nIn 2019, the foreign currency backlog should continue \nto shrink as the central bank injects more foreign exchange \ninto the system at the same rate as in 2018 or higher thanks \nto proceeds from its 2018 sovereign borrowing and up to \n$450 million of new sovereign borrowing planned for 2019 \n(Figure\u00a03.33.7). The central bank has increased its monthly \nallocations to up to $60 million in recent months. Continued \nallocations will allow the rolling up of another backlog, this \none composed of undeclared dividends estimated by market \nparticipants at about $500 million. These are retained \nprofits held by foreign companies operating in PNG and \nheretofore unable to remit currency overseas. In the longer \nterm, observers predict, new plans for large resource projects \nexpected to begin in 2020 will bring significant inflows of \nforeign exchange, helping to restore the market to equilibrium.\n\nWhile a market-determined exchange rate allows \n\nequilibrium that puts an end to foreign exchange shortages \nand removes distortions that can hurt exporters and industries \nthat compete with imports, ongoing structural reform is just \nas critical for attracting foreign capital and helping to build \nan economy that is more diversified and shock resilient. \nMany\u00a0such reforms are outlined in the Medium\u00a0Term \nDevelopment Plan 3, 2018\u20132022, recently released by \nthe government. They include increasing investment in \ninfrastructure to facilitate business and trade, expanding \naccess to investable land, continuing revenue-raising reform, \nand improving the management of public finances. \n\n\fSolomon Islands\n\nDespite  rising  exports  of  timber,  fish,  and  minerals,  growth  decelerated  in  2018  as \ngovernment  spending  slowed  and  cash  crop  yields  declined.  Inflation  rose  on  higher \ntaxes  but  will  ease  this  year  and  next.  Growth  will  likely  slow  in  2019  and  2020  as  new \nconstruction  only  partly  offsets  lower  logging  output.  The  current  account  deficit  is \nexpected  to  return  to  deficit,  reversing  last  year\u2019s  surplus.  A  tax  review  shows  progress, \nbut  broadening  the  revenue  base  remains  a  challenge. \n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic growth is estimated to have slowed slightly to 3.0% \nin 2018 (Figure 3.34.1). Log output continued to outperform \nexpectations and increased by 2.6% in 2018 to a record 2.7 \nmillion cubic meters (Figure 3.34.2). Higher volume and global \nprices sent the value of log exports up by more than 25.0%. \nExports of minerals, notably bauxite and nickel, rose by 29.9%. \nFish exports grew 15.1%, in line with growth in the previous \nyear. However, the export value of most crops declined in 2018, \nwith copra and coconut oil falling the most. The exception \nwas cocoa, which reversed a plunge by 47.5% in 2017 with a \nrebound by 42.7% in 2018.\n\nGrowth in services slowed to 3.5% in 2018. Wholesale \nand retail trade decelerated with lower cash crop output and \nhigher taxes, and as growth in government spending slowed. \nIndustry\u00a0expanded 1.2% in 2018, mainly on higher mining.\n\nThe government made a concerted effort to restore fiscal \n\nstability after several years of widening deficits, which had \nsignificantly reduced its cash reserves, undermining their \nusefulness as a buffer against shocks. The fiscal deficit \nnarrowed from the equivalent of 3.8% of GDP in 2017 to 0.6% \nin 2018 (Figure 3.34.3). Growth in government spending slowed \nwith substantial reductions in development expenditure. \nRevenue rose on higher log export duties, estimated to be \nup from 2017 by more than a fifth, and budget support from \ndevelopment partners. A domestic development bond helped \nto capitalize a new state-owned enterprise to lay an undersea \ntelecommunications cable. \n\nA new price index introduced in 2018 showed inflation \n\naccelerating to 3.3% in 2018, mainly on higher prices for \ndomestic goods; partly reflecting hikes in the goods tax, \nexcises on alcohol and tobacco, and import duties on fuel. \n\nThis chapter was written by Jacqueline Connell of the Pacific Liaison and \nCoordination Office and Prince Cruz, consultant, of the Pacific Department, \nADB, Manila.\n\n3.34.1\u2002 Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points \n\n1.8\n\n2.6\n\n3.4\n\n3.2\n\n3.0\n\n2.4\n\n2.3\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Solomon Islands National Statistics Office; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n3.34.2\u2002 Logging output and exports\n\nOutput\n\nMillion cubic meters \n\nExports\n\nSI$ billion\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nEstimate\n\nSources: Solomon Islands National Statistics Office; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n\f320(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n\u201325\n\n\u201350\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nThe\u00a0new price index lowered the share for food mostly in favor \nof alcohol and tobacco, based on the results of the 2012\u20132013 \nHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey (Figure 3.34.4).\n\nThe current account turned into a surplus equal to 3.9% of \n\nGDP in 2018, mainly on a 21.2% rise in exports of goods that \nexceeded import growth at only 8.8%.

The economic impact is potentially large, given \nthat logging supplied some 72% of exports in 2018 and is the \ncountry\u2019s largest employer after the government. With El Ni\u00f1o \nweather disturbances expected in 2019, the fish catch will \nlikely suffer, and recovery in cash crops may sputter. \n\nGrowth will depend on infrastructure investments in roads, \n\nairports, and the undersea telecommunications cable financed \nby development partners. Construction of the Tina River \nHydropower Project is expected to commence in 2020, after \ndelays in signing the electric power purchase agreement. \n\nThe government aims to balance the budget in 2019 by \n\nfurther cutting government development expenditure by \nabout a third compared with 2018. Partly offsetting this, the \npayroll budget is projected to increase by 15% from 2018 to \naccommodate new staff positions and increased allowances, \nincluding a 3.5% boost to cost-of-living allowances for all \npublic\u00a0servants. A national election scheduled for April 2019 \nmay put additional pressure on government spending and the \nbudget, including an increase for police security. \n\ngovernment revenues in the medium term. The government \nprojects logging export duties to fall in 2019 by 16% from 2018. \nIt hopes to claw back some revenue by raising logging license \nfees and improving compliance, while recent amendments to \nthe withholding tax and the goods tax should also increase \ncollections. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen in 2020 as \ngovernment investment in the Tina River Hydropower Project \nbegins. \n\n3.34.4\u2002 Components of the consumer price \n\nindex basket\n\nHousehold furnishings\nCommunication\nAlcoholic beverages & tobacco\nHousing & utilities\nTransport\nFood & nonalcoholic beverages\nOthers\n\nOld index\n\n(Q4 2005 = 100)\n\nNew index\n(2017 = 100)\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Central Bank of Solomon Islands.\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n\u20022.4\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20131.4\n\n\u20022.3\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20132.6\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nThe Forestry Sustainability Policy is expected to weigh on \n\n3.34.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSolomon Islands\u2002\u2002321\n\n3.34.5\u2002Visitor arrivals by mode of transport\n\nAir\nCruise ship\n\nThousand arrivals\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nEstimate\n\nSources: Solomon Islands National Statistics Office; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n3.34.6\u2002 Domestic revenue\n\nGoods & sales tax\nPersonal & withholding tax\nLogging export duties\nImport duty & excise tax\nCompany tax\nOthers\n\n$ billion\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nEstimate\n\nSources: Solomon Islands Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury budget documents; ADB estimates.\n\nLower inflation is expected as a base effect from higher \ntaxes in 2018 dissipates and as global commodity prices fall, \nin particular for oil. However, the increased cost-of-living \nallowances for public servants threaten to stoke inflation in 2019.\n\nAs logging exports taper and imports for construction \nprojects rise, the current account balance is expected to fall \nback into deficits equal to 1.4% of GDP in 2019 and 2.6% in\u00a02020. \nOn\u00a0the other hand, visitor arrivals by air are expected to \ncontinue to grow, boosting exports of services.\n\nThe reopening of the country\u2019s sole gold mine, Gold Ridge, \n\nposes an upside risk to the forecast. Rehabilitating the mine, \nwhich closed in 2014 following flashfloods, could spur growth. \nThis prospect is a reminder that the government needs to \ncontinue strengthening its regulation and taxation of mining to \nmaximize its benefits and encourage inclusive growth. \n\nAny delays in infrastructure projects, particularly Tina River, \n\nwould weigh on growth. The only domestic bank in Solomon \nIslands provides key services to the logging industry but lost \nits correspondent bank relationship for US dollars in 2018. \nThe\u00a0problem was resolved by year-end, but it highlights the \nchallenge to the economy and government financing posed by \nheavy reliance on revenue from the logging industry.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014sustaining tax reform\nThe current tax structure of Solomon Islands is complex, \noutdated, and expensive to administer. It is heavily biased \ntoward consumption taxes, partly reflecting dependence on \nimports and the relatively small proportion of people in formal \nemployment and business (Figure 3.34.6). By relying on high \nrates applied to a narrow base, the tax system discourages \ncompliance. \n\nGetting the tax system right is important in light of \nexpected\u00a0declines in logging revenue in the medium term. \nIn\u00a0November 2017, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury began \na system review with the aim of making revenue collection more \nefficient, fair, and equitable.\n\nThe first phase of the tax review has focused on tax \nadministration and consumption taxes. The next phase will \naddress income tax with the aim of lowering marginal tax rates \nand expanding the tax base. Currently, the highest marginal tax \nrate is 40% for taxable annual incomes higher than SI$60,000, \nwhich is five times GDP per capita in 2017. In 2016, only 4.6% of \nregistered income tax payers filed an income tax return. \n\nIn 2018, Parliament enacted amendments to the Goods \nTax\u00a0Act that increased excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco and \nchanged procedures for collecting withholding taxes to improve \ncompliance and bring them in line with international practice. \nThese measures will generate more revenue and fiscal space \nwith which to respond to shocks. \n\n\fTimor-Leste\n\nThe  economy  contracted  as  political  uncertainty  disrupted  and  reduced  public  spending. \nInflation  revived,  and  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed.  The  formation  of  a  new \ngovernment  and  approval  of  the  2019  budget  pave  the  way  for  fiscal  stimulus  that  will \ndrive growth in 2019 and 2020. While the government plans to play a more active role in \ndeveloping  onshore  oil  and  gas  processing,  diversification  into  hardwood  forestry  could,  if \nsustainably  managed,  offer  valuable  benefits.\n\nEconomic performance\nReductions in public spending caused GDP excluding the \nlarge offshore petroleum sector (hereafter GDP) to contract \nby 0.5% in 2018 (Figure 3.35.1). Following a sharp decline in \n2017, public expenditure excluding grants from development \npartners, which are off budget, fell by a further 2.8% in 2018 \nto $1.16\u00a0billion. While public capital investment increased \nsignificantly, it was more than offset by lower recurrent \nspending. Payments for salaries and wages fell by 2.2%, \npurchases of goods and services by 9.3%, and transfer \npayments by 23.9%, reflecting lower payments to the Special \nAdministrative Region of Oe-Cusse Ambeno (Figure 3.35.2). \nPublic spending problems reflected political uncertainty \nthat continued through much of 2018. Parliament was dissolved \nin March without approving a budget. This left the government \nto operate in the first part of the year under a duo-decimal \nbudget regime, which allowed monthly budget appropriations \nof up to one-twelfth of the 2017 budget. In September, a budget \nfor the remainder of 2018 was approved. It called for rapidly \nscaling up expenditure, but implementation was constrained by \nits late approval. The resulting decline in public spending was \ncompounded by a reported 10.3% drop in grants from bilateral \nand multilateral development partners to $156.0 million, equal \nto 9.5% of GDP (Figure 3.35.3).\n\nTighter fiscal policy constrained demand for a range of \nconsumption and investment goods. Merchandise imports \ndeclined by 11.5% on lower imports of food, consumer goods, \nconstruction materials, and equipment and machinery. With\u00a0new \nvehicle registrations down by 19.4%, the value of vehicle imports \nfell by 48.1%.

Full execution would \nsee public spending rise by 22.3% over 2018. Planned increases \nare concentrated in recurrent spending, budgeting 6.8% more \nfor salaries and wages, 13.4% more for goods and services, and \n35.6% more for transfer payments. These increases are partly \ndriven by a budgeted 17.8% increase over the 2015\u20132018 average \nallocated for health programs and a 32.1% increase allocated \nfor education (Figure 3.35.6). \n\nThe budget includes $2.0 billion for capital investment \nfrom 2019 to 2023, with 82.9% of it implemented through the \nInfrastructure Fund, an autonomous agency mandated to \ncoordinate the preparation and financing of major projects. \nPublic capital investment is set to increase by 27.6% in 2019 \nand a further 64.5% in 2020. Upgrading roads and bridges \naccounts for 59.4% of capital investment in 2019 and 2020, \nwith investment in the Tasi Mane project accounting for a \nfurther 16.2% (Figure 3.35.7). Several other large investment \nprojects are expected to move forward this year and next with \ngovernment support. Construction on the new Tibar Bay port \nformally commenced in August 2018 and will ramp up in 2019. \nThe initial investment to develop the project is estimated at \n$280 million, of which the government contributed $129.5 \nmillion. Separately, the government has contributed $50 million \nfor equity investment and other support to develop limestone \nmining and cement manufacturing in the Baucau region. \nRising capital investment will stimulate demand for \nconstruction services and boost employment. In agriculture, \ncoffee production is expected to increase in 2019 with favorable \nweather so far, and the government will seek to consolidate \nrecent increases in the area planted with maize and rice. \nProspects for further growth in tourism hinge on a sustained \nreduction in the cost of travel to and from Timor-Leste, which \nrose sharply in 2018.

Sandalwood, which is prized for its fine \nfragrance, was the largest export for much of the colonial \nperiod. However, the overharvesting of wild stocks in the \nyears before independence steadily undermined production, \nprompting a current moratorium on exports. Deforestation \nfrom population growth and the expansion of subsistence \nfarming is an issue and one of the largest emitters of \ngreenhouse gases in the country. \n\nThe government is committed to halting deforestation and \n\ndeveloping new plantation forests. It has begun to establish \nsandalwood plantations in some areas, and many households \nplant small numbers of trees close to their homes. Recent \nanalysis of satellite data found 2,400 hectares of teak growing \nin stands of 0.1 hectares or larger.

Analysis of satellite data has identified \naround 32,500 hectares of suitable land that is not currently \nforested, protected, or used to grow food. Preliminary \nestimates suggest that the development of a 30,000 hectare \nplantation estate could support the production of $100 million \nworth of teak per year, equal to 6.3% of current GDP. The bulk \nof this production would be exported, and the establishment, \nmaintenance, and harvesting of tropical hardwoods could \ncreate employment equal to 2,000 full-time jobs. Potential also \nexists to increase the value of wood generated in and harvested \nfrom natural forests by restocking selected native species \nsuch\u00a0as sandalwood.\n\nDeveloping a successful plantation sector is a long-term \n\nundertaking, requiring first the strengthening of forest \nmanagement. In the short term, the key priorities include \nbuilding human resources, developing an integrated forest \ninformation management system, and establishing long-term \nresearch and trial plots across the main agroecological zones. \nWhile some stakeholders may wish to see tree planting \nincreased very rapidly, doing so without first establishing a \nstrong knowledge base would pose an unnecessary risk that \nnew plantations perform poorly or fail. \n\nNew plantations could be established using various models \n\nfocused on smallholders and communities, or ranging up to \ngovernment-managed planting on state land or larger-scale \nprivate investment. Uncertain land tenure is likely to deter \nprivate investment, but the government should try to leverage \nprivate sector capacity by developing a model for public\u2013private \npartnership or using other mechanisms to mitigate risks and \nincentivize tree planting. \n\n\fVanuatu\n\nStrong growth in construction and tourism sustained economic expansion in 2018 despite \na  disaster-induced  contraction  in  agriculture.  Inflation  slowed,  and  the  current  account \nmoved  into  surplus.  Growth  is  expected  to  remain  stable  in  2019  and  2020  as  tourism \nbenefits  from  the  completion  of  major  infrastructure  projects.  Inflation  will  ease  further, \nand  the  current  account  will  remain  in  surplus.

This\u00a0was \ndown, however, from 4.4% growth in 2017 because of a sharp \ndecline in the large agriculture sector caused by Cyclone\u00a0Hola \nin March 2018 and a volcanic eruption on Ambae\u00a0Island \nin Penama Province (Figure 3.36.2). Low prices for copra \nexacerbated a decline in output.\n\ntourism accelerated. Visitor arrivals rose by 7.8% to 358,000 \nvisitors. This topped the previous record of 357,400 set in 2013. \nArrivals by air rose by 4.7% in 2018, while cruise ship arrivals \nalmost doubled that rate with growth of 9.2% (Figure 3.36.3). \nSlightly more than half of air travelers were from Australia, 13% \nfrom New Caledonia, and 12% from New Zealand. Travel\u00a0and \ntourism are estimated to have contributed 45% of GDP in 2018.\nGrowth in industry remained strong as construction \ncontinued on major infrastructure projects: facilities to \ncomplement newly upgraded wharves in Port Vila and \nLuganville, rehabilitation of the main airport in Port Vila and \nother airports on outer islands, and road projects on multiple \nislands. Government capital expenditure doubled from 2017, \nmost of it financed by development partners. Renewable energy \nprojects and private investment into tourist-oriented facilities \nand other businesses contributed to industry growth. \n\nGovernment recurrent expenditure fell by 2.8% despite \nemployee compensation rising by more than a quarter following \na Government Remuneration Tribunal ruling in favor of higher \npublic service salary scales. Although grants from development \npartners declined by 39.4% with the completion of major \nprojects, total revenue rose by 9.5%. Nontax revenue, derived \nmainly from the sale of secondary passports, rose by 79.5% \n\nThis chapter was written by Jacquelline Connell of the Pacific Liaison and \nCoordination Office, ADB, Sydney, and Prince Cruz, consultant, Pacific \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.\n\n\f328(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\n3.36.2\u2002 Principal exports\n\nKava\nCoconut oil\nCopra\nCocoa\nOthers\n\nVt billion\n\nfrom\u00a02017 and now provides a third of all revenue. Nontax revenue \nhas surpassed the value-added tax (VAT) as the biggest single \nsource of domestic revenue despite a higher VAT following a rate \nincrease in January 2018. Excise taxes and taxes on international \ntrade were also higher (Figure 3.36.4). With expenditure rising \nby only 4.4%, the fiscal surplus expanded from the equivalent of \n5.1% of GDP in 2017 to 6.8%. This allowed for early repayment of \napproximately 6% of government debt at the end of 2018. \n\nThe higher VAT rate notwithstanding, inflation eased from \n\n3.1% in 2017 to 2.2% last year. While food prices rose by 4.1%, \nprices for clothing and for housing and utilities increased by \nless\u00a0than 2.0%. The price index for education fell by 11.1%. \n\nA fall in merchandise exports was offset by higher exports \nof\u00a0services in the form of tourism and lower imports of goods \nand\u00a0services, allowing the current account to climb to a small \nsurplus equal to 0.5% of GDP. Higher exports of kava and cocoa \nonly partly offset large drops in the export value of fish, copra, \nbeef, and timber. Meanwhile, higher fuel imports only partly \noffset lower imports by value of food, basic manufactured \nproducts, and\u00a0machinery and transport equipment. \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is expected to moderate to 3.0% in 2019 and 2.8% in \n2020. Tourism looks set to remain strong, but construction will \nlikely contract with the completion of major infrastructure \nprojects. The performance of agriculture is anticipated highly \nuneven because it will take several years to grow replacements \nfor livestock and damaged coconut trees and other crops.\n\nAfter several years of rapid growth fueled by reconstruction \nand infrastructure upgrading in the aftermath of Cyclone\u00a0Pam, \nconstruction is expected to return to levels prevailing in earlier \nyears. However, this reduction should be partly offset by \nexpansion in retail trade, transportation, and accommodation \nand restaurants as these service areas benefit from higher \ntourist arrivals. Growth in public administration is expected \nto continue as the government implements various projects to \npromote education and tourism, enhance disaster resilience, \nand implement higher wages mandated by the Government \nRemuneration Tribunal.\n\nSpending under the 2019 budget is 40.9% higher than \nactual expenditure in 2018, though realizing expenditure \nin\u00a02019 depends on large grants from development partners. \nThe\u00a0government anticipates a fiscal deficit equal to 6.4% of \nGDP\u00a0in 2019.\n\nInflation is expected to ease slightly to 2.0% in 2019 and 2020 \nas supply constraints caused by the recent disasters are resolved, \nbringing price stability for food and beverages (Figure\u00a03.36.5). \nTransport inflation is also forecast to remain subdued with the \ncompletion of roads and other major infrastructure projects, \n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n\u2013200\n\nVt billion\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nEstimate\n\nSources: Vanuatu National Statistics Office; ADB estimates.\n\n3.36.3\u2002 Visitor arrivals by mode of transport\n\nCruise ship\nAir\n\nCruise ship\nAir\n\nThousand arrivals\n\n% change\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nEstimate\n\nSources: Vanuatu National Statistics Office; ADB estimates.\n\n3.36.4\u2002 Government revenues\n\nValue-added tax\nTrade taxes\nOther taxes\nNontax revenue\nGrants\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Vanuatu Department of Finance and Treasury.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nVanuatu\u2002\u2002329\n\nand as international oil prices remain low.

The\u00a0increase in flights is part of a tourism plan \ncalled Shared Vision 2030, which targets visitor arrivals by air \nreaching 450,000 by 2030, a fourfold increase from 2018. \n\nAs a key generator of employment and income in Vanuatu, \ntourism is pivotal to poverty reduction. However, the industry \nis\u00a0vulnerable to disaster and is currently concentrated in \nPort\u00a0Vila and Luganville. Vanuatu faces a challenge in \nmaximizing the positive benefits of tourism toward creating \njobs\u00a0and supporting inclusive, sustainable growth. \n\nThe government has made some progress in climate \n\nproofing new public infrastructure. This enhances the \nresilience of a tourism industry confronting frequent disasters \nand climate change. Improving facilities for water supply \nand sewage treatment\u00a0outside Port Vila may encourage more \ntourists to venture into new areas, while providing benefits \nto local communities from improved water and sanitation. \nThe expansion\u00a0of technical and vocational training could help \nincrease local employment in better-paid positions in growing \nhospitality and transport industries. Preserving Vanuatu\u2019s \ncultural and environmental assets will be crucial to the \nsustainability of tourism.\n\nThe benefits of tourism could be made more inclusive \nby enhancing links with suppliers in local communities of \nagriculture goods and services. Around 80% of the population \ndepends on agriculture for livelihood, and an established \nnetwork of farmers and traders already exists to provide services \nto hotels and other tourism facilities. The capacity and scope \nof these networks are limited, however, and many hotels and \nrestaurants favor imported produce over local supplies. Ways to \naddress these issues are proposed in the Vanuatu Agritourism \nAction Plan, which the government finalized in 2016. \n\n3.36.5\u2002Inflation\n\nHeadline\nFood\nTransport\nUtilities\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Vanuatu National Statistics Office; ADB estimates.\n\n3.36.6\u2002 Current account balance\n\nTransfers\nIncome\nServices\nTrade\nCurrent account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Reserve Bank of Vanuatu; ADB estimates.\n\n\fNorth Pacific economies\n\nGrowth  last  year  weakened  in  the  storm-hit  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  and  in  the \nMarshall  Islands  as  construction  slowed,  but  Palau  achieved  modest  recovery  on  higher \npublic  and  private  investment.

The Marshall \nIslands grew more slowly as capacity constraints impeded \ninfrastructure construction. In Palau, public and private \ninvestments drove recovery from steep contraction in FY2017.\nIn March 2018, Tropical Depression Jelawat brought \n\nflooding and landslides to Pohnpei State in the FSM, damaging \nroads and other critical infrastructure. A state of emergency \nwas declared, and following a joint damage assessment, the \nUS approved in July disaster funding under its Compact of \nFree\u00a0Association with the FSM.\n\nStimulus from reconstruction partly offset the adverse \n\neconomic impact of the disaster, keeping FY2018 growth \nfairly solid at 2.0%, albeit down from 2.4% in FY2017. \nAdministrative\u00a0support from the US helped to overcome \nsome constraints on implementation capacity. This assistance \nsupplements transitional arrangements that have been in \nplace since July 2017, with the US Army Corps of Engineers \nsupporting compact-funded projects and helping to resolve \nproject implementation issues.\n\nIn the Marshall Islands, growth slowed from 3.6% in FY2017 \n\nto 2.5%, and the economy remains dependent on infrastructure \ninvestment projects funded by development partners and US \ncompact grants. Continuing capacity constraints in the Marshall \nIslands have stifled project implementation. As projects \nnevertheless reach completion, economic stimulus diminishes.\n\nThis chapter was written by Rommel Rabanal and Cara Tinio of the Pacific Department, \nADB, Manila.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nNorth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002331\n\nPalau\u2019s economy recovered to 0.5% growth FY2018, \n\n3.37.2\u2002 Visitor arrivals in Palau by source\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nJapan\nTaipei,China\nRepublic of Korea\nOthers\n\nThousands\n\n180\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 September of \nthat year.\nSource: Palau Bureau of Labor and Immigration.\n\n3.37.3\u2002 Fishing license revenue in the \nFederated States of Micronesia\n\nAmount\n\n% of GDP\n\n% of GDP\n\n65.2\n\n63.4\n\n72.6\n\n65.0\n\n$ million\n\n75\n\n50\n\n47.5\n\n25\n\n0\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 September of that \nyear.\nSources: Federated States of Micronesia Department \nof Finance and Administration and Division of National \nStatistics.\n\nreversing 3.7% contraction in FY2017. Growth would have been \nstronger if a nascent rebound in tourism had not been cut short \nwhen two flight services were discontinued. Visitor arrivals \ngrew by a solid 6.6% in the first half of FY2018 following a \ncumulative 29.9% drop in tourist numbers over the previous 2 \nyears. However, the termination of Delta Airlines flights from \nTokyo in May and the indefinite suspension of Palau Pacific \nAirways charter flights from Hong Kong, China in July drove \nvisitor arrivals sharply down in the second half. For the whole \nyear, tourist arrivals from Palau\u2019s two main sources dropped, \nfrom Japan by 5.4% and from the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) by 9.5% after it restricted tour groups transiting to Palau \nthrough Hong Kong, China. Consequently, total visitor arrivals \nfell by 5.0% in FY2018, the third consecutive year of decline \n(Figure 3.37.2).\n\nRobust construction nevertheless supported economic \ngrowth. Public infrastructure projects funded by development \npartners proceeded in earnest, and some private hotel projects \nwere completed.\n\nFiscal positions continued to weaken across the North \nPacific in FY2018. Preliminary estimates show that the FSM \nconsolidated fiscal surplus eroded from the equivalent of \n15% of GDP in FY2017 to 10%. Revenue from fishing license \nfees fell from their historic high but still equaled 17% of GDP \n(Figure\u00a03.37.3). However, public wages continued to expand \nalong with government expenditure on services it contracts to \nimplement projects funded by development partners. Capital \nexpenditure built on increases recorded in FY2017, when \nseveral project management bottlenecks were cleared. \n\nLikewise, the Marshall Islands is estimated to have realized \na smaller fiscal surplus, equal to 3.0% of GDP. The\u00a04.5%\u00a0surplus \nin FY2017 reflected record fishing license fee revenues\u00a0worth \n19.4% of GDP that came, not from significantly higher \ncollections in the period, but mostly from a large, one-time \nappropriation of receipts previously undisbursed by the agency \nresponsible for collecting them. In FY2018, fishing license \nrevenues plunged by 37.7%, reverting to the norm before \nFY2017 and driving total revenue down by 16.5%.\n\nPalau also saw its fiscal surplus narrow, from 4.8% of GDP \nin FY2017 to 4.3%, as expenditure increased to fund transfers, \nincluding to the civil service pension fund. Steady deterioration \nin the government\u2019s fiscal position also reflected continuing \ndelays in implementing much-needed tax reform that would \nfacilitate higher domestic revenue mobilization. \n\nInflation in the North Pacific is driven largely by import \ncosts. Higher international prices for food and fuel, and their \nspillover on prices for other consumer goods, stirred inflation \nin two of the three economies but were countered by subdued \neconomic activity.

Growth \nis projected to taper slightly to 2.5% in FY2020 as some capital \nprojects near completion. \n\nGrowth in Palau is similarly projected to increase with \nexpectations of some recovery in tourism and further increases \nin capital expenditure thanks to greater financial assistance \nfrom the US. Visitor arrivals last year were already below the \nnumber recorded in FY2012\u2014before the influx of tourists from \nthe PRC gathered momentum\u2014so no further sharp reductions \nare likely.

Although \nmost funds are allocated to Palau\u2019s Compact Trust Fund, \n$20\u00a0million will be available to finance agreed infrastructure \nprojects that could boost annual capital spending by a quarter\u2014\nplus $2 million annually for infrastructure maintenance. \nA\u00a0further $22 million in direct economic assistance promises \nfurther economic stimulus. Growth is thus seen to accelerate to \n3.0% in FY2019 and FY2020.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nNorth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002333\n\nGrowth in the Marshall Islands, by contrast, is projected \n\n3.37.4\u2002 Inflation in the North Pacific \n\nto continue slowing to 2.3% in FY2019 and 2.2% in FY2020 \nas project completion and persistent implementation \nconstraints spell less stimulus from infrastructure investment. \nThe\u00a0outcome of national elections at the end of 2019 will better \nshape economic projections for FY2020 and beyond.\n\nThe Government of the Marshall Islands plans to issue \na cryptocurrency called the sovereign in mid-2019, posing \npotentially significant downside risks to growth: inflationary \npressures if the sovereign causes excessive growth in \nthe money supply, observed volatility in cryptocurrency \nvalues, and the threat of quarantine from the international \nfinancial\u00a0system.\n\nInflation in all three economies is projected to ease \nslightly in FY2019 before reaccelerating in FY2020 in line \nwith international food and fuel price trends (Figure 3.37.4). \nCommodity prices are likewise expected to be reflected in \nimport bills, but other factors are seen to drive divergent trends \nin current account positions in the North Pacific. The\u00a0FSM \ncurrent account surplus will likely narrow further to the \nequivalent of 1.0% of GDP in FY2019 and recover somewhat \nto 1.5% in FY2020, reflecting the effect of El Ni\u00f1o on tuna \nmigration and thus on fishing license revenue. By contrast, the \nMarshall Islands current account surplus is expected to widen \nto 8.0% of GDP in FY2019 as capital equipment imports decline \nwith project completion, and then narrow by half a percentage \npoint in FY2020 with rising commodity import prices. \nIn\u00a0Palau, the current account deficit is projected to narrow \nto 16.3% of GDP in FY2019 and 16.0% in FY2020 as tourism \nreceipts recover from the recent slump.\n\nWith fishing license revenue in the FSM at risk of falling, \nthe fiscal surplus is forecast to narrow to the equivalent of 7.0% \nof GDP in FY2019 before bouncing back to 10.0% in FY2020.\nIn the Marshall Islands, fiscal surpluses are forecast to \nnarrow further to the equivalent of 2% of GDP in FY2019 and \nthen edge back to 3% in FY2020. High recurrent spending, \nincluding subsidies to state-owned enterprises and continued \nsocial security transfers, will remain unchecked if necessary \nreform is not implemented (Figure 3.37.5). Tax reform \nlanguished, stifling domestic revenue collection. \n\nIn Palau, the fiscal surplus is expected to increase to the \nequivalent of 8.9% of GDP in FY2019 with a surge in grants and \nthen fall back to 1.9% in FY2020 as grant inflows ease.\n\nThe parties to the Nauru Agreement, which together \nmanage fishing rights in most of the Pacific, have announced \nplans to expand their vessel day scheme to cover other forms \nof fishing.

To illustrate, growth accelerated from FY2009 \nto FY2011 on a series of airport upgrades, then contracted for \n3\u00a0consecutive years as public investment stagnated. Economic \ngrowth in the Marshall Islands has similarly depended on \npublic investment projects, as well as on grant-supported \ngovernment operations. Fiscal constraints caused by variation \nin grant inflows contributed to contractions in FY2008 and \nFY2009, then the airport upgrade in Majuro drove expansion \nfrom FY2010 until its completion in FY2013. Contractions \nin the next few years reflected delays in implementing new \nprojects, and subsequent recovery accompanied project \nresumption.\n\nIn recent years, fishing license fees have stimulated \nfinances and growth in both the FSM and the Marshall \nIslands. However, ADB analysis has shown volatility driven \nby El Ni\u00f1o weather patterns, as detailed in the December 2017 \nPacific Economic Monitor. In Palau, volatility derives mainly \nfrom tourism peaks and troughs that often mirror global \nfinancial and economic crises or even more localized events, \nsuch as a collapse in arrivals from Taipei,China caused by a \ndownturn there in FY2013, or an influx of tourists from the \nPRC in FY2015 followed by the recent policy-induced decline. \nTrust funds can help minimize economic volatility by \nsmoothing government revenue otherwise subject to large \nfluctuations. Higher revenues earned during peak periods can \nbe stored in these instruments to build fiscal buffers for use \nin subsequent downturns. This allows governments to smooth \ntheir annual expenditure and, given the public sector\u2019s outsize \nimpact on economic activity in the North Pacific, tamp down \nvolatility in GDP growth.\n\nFurther, as disasters and extreme weather can exacerbate \n\nvolatility, disaster risk management and climate change \nadaptation need to be emphasized. Climate-proofing can be \nincorporated into comprehensive strategies to strengthen \npublic investment planning and implementation, yielding more \nsustainable infrastructure development.\n\n\fSouth Pacific economies\n\nThe South Pacific economies of the Cook Islands, Samoa, and Tonga all grew in 2018. The \nCook  Islands  expanded  strongly  on  record  visitor  arrivals.  Samoa  also  saw  strong  growth \nin visitor arrivals but slower GDP growth because of substantial declines in manufacturing \nand  fishing.  Tonga  was  severely  affected  by  Cyclone  Gita  in  February.  South  Pacific \neconomies must keep tourism sustainable to ensure that this remains an important source \nof  growth  into  the  future.\n\n3.38.1\u2002 GDP growth in the  \n\nSouth Pacific economies\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n%\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance & \nEconomic Management; Samoa Bureau of Statistics; \nTonga\u00a0Department of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe Cook Islands economy grew by 7.0% in fiscal year 2018 \n(FY2018, ended 30 June 2018), supported by continued strong \ngrowth in tourism (Figure 3.38.1). Visitor arrivals increased \nby 6.2% with a notable 23.4% increase from Canada and 23.7% \nfrom French Polynesia. Benefiting from expansion in tourism \nwere related sectors: retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and \ntransport and communications. Aside from these sectors, the \nimplementation of projects for renewable energy on outer \nislands and water supply and sanitation pushed growth in \nconstruction to 25.0%. Small declines were recorded in fishing, \nfinance, and health care.\n\nGrowth in Samoa at 0.9% in FY2018 was considerably \nslower as a large manufacturing enterprise closed and fishing \ndeclined. A steep fall in nonfood manufacturing was, however, \noffset by growth in hotels and restaurants, construction, and \ncommunications and business services. Visitor arrivals grew \nby 11.5%, a sixfold improvement on average annual tourism \ngrowth in FY2010\u2013FY2017 at 1.9%. Agriculture, transport, and \nfinance all declined. \n\nThe vulnerability of Tonga to disasters was evident \nfrom damage inflicted on the economy by Cyclone Gita in \nFebruary\u00a02018. The destruction of crops, public infrastructure, \nand buildings limited growth to 0.4% in FY2018, well below \nthe 3.2% average posted from FY2015 to FY2017. Only rapid \nrecovery efforts soon after the cyclone saved the Tongan \neconomy from contraction.\n\nIn the Cook Islands, prices rose in FY2018 by 0.4% as \nincreases for food and transportation more than offset falling \nprices for housing and household operation (Figure 3.38.2). \n\nThis chapter was written by Shiu Raj Singh of the Pacific Subregional Office, ADB, \nSuva; and Noel Del Castillo, consultant, Pacific Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n\f336(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nIn\u00a0Samoa, higher domestic and import prices in FY2018 pushed \ninflation to 3.7%, with substantially higher prices for food and \nnonalcoholic beverages and for education and lesser rises for \nalcoholic beverages and for transport and communications. \nSomewhat offsetting these higher prices were price declines \nfor housing and household operation. Tonga\u2019s inflation \naveraged higher by 5.3% in FY2018, with food prices increasing \nsubstantially as a result of the damage and losses caused by \nCyclone Gita. Contributing to inflation were higher prices for \ntransportation and beverages, including kava, a local relaxant.\nThe Cook Islands\u2019 fiscal surplus shrank by more than half \n\nfrom the equivalent of 9.2% of GDP in FY2017 to 4.1% a year \nlater. Although revenue increased in FY2018, even higher \noperating and capital expenditure narrowed the surplus. \nNet\u00a0public debt, all of it external, fell from the equivalent of \n17.3% of GDP in FY2017 to 16.8% only because of strong GDP \ngrowth, as debt was higher in nominal terms. In any case, debt \nremains comfortably below the government ceiling of 35% of \nGDP. The government maintained a debt-service reserve equal \nto 3.6% of GDP in FY2018 and held additional cash reserves \nequal to 20.6% of GDP.\n\nSamoa had a small fiscal surplus in FY2018, reversing a \ndeficit equal to 1.1% of GDP in FY2017. This first surplus in \n9 years was achieved through rigorous expenditure control \nand higher external grants received after the International \nMonetary Fund assessed Samoa to be at high risk of debt \ndistress because of its exposure to disasters. At the end of \nFY2018, external debt equaled 49.4% of GDP, slightly higher \nthan a year earlier because exchange rate movements were \nunfavorable and contracted loans continued to be disbursed for \nongoing projects. \n\n1.6% of GDP as budget support from development partners, \nand the postponement of investment projects following \nCyclone\u00a0Gita, more than offset higher spending on emergency \nresponse and rehabilitation. External debt increased from \nthe\u00a0equivalent of 39.5% of GDP at the end of FY2017 to 41.8% a \nyear later.\n\nThe Cook Islands updated and substantially revised in \n\nFY2018 data on the balance of payments. The result was \nsharply lower estimates for past current account surpluses, \nwhich followed from revised estimates for tourism inflows. \nThe surplus in FY2017 was revised down from the equivalent \nof 25.5% of GDP to 1.6%, rising in FY2018 to 2.2% on a higher \nsurplus in trade in services. In Samoa, a current account \nsurplus equal to 4.7% of GDP in FY2018 reversed a 1.8% deficit \nin the previous year thanks to strong growth in visitor arrivals \nand a 24.3% increase in remittances. In Tonga, higher imports \noffset huge grant flows from development partners for cyclone \nrelief to narrow the current account surplus to the equivalent \n\n3.38.2\u2002 Inflation\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance & \nEconomic Management; Samoa Bureau of Statistics; \nTonga\u00a0Department of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n% of GDP\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201320\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance & \nEconomic Management; Samoa Bureau of Statistics; \nTonga\u00a0Department of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\nTonga\u2019s fiscal balance ended FY2018 in a surplus equal to \n\n3.38.3\u2002 Current account balance\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSouth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002337\n\n3.38.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nCook Islands\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nSamoa\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nTonga\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n2019\n\n\u2002\u20026.0\n\n\u2002\u20021.0\n\n\u2002\u20022.8\n\n2020\n\n\u2002\u20024.5\n\n\u2002\u20021.5\n\n\u2002\u20023.4\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u2002\u20133.5\n\n\u2002\u20023.0\n\n\u2002\u20021.5\n\n\u2002\u20133.0\n\n\u2002\u20022.1\n\n\u2002\u20025.3\n\n\u201312.2\n\n\u2002\u20021.9\n\n\u2002\u20025.3\n\n\u201311.2\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending in 30 June of \nthat\u00a0year.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nof 1.8% of GDP in FY2018 (Figure 3.38.3). Meanwhile, \nremittances remained robust as Tongans living overseas \nprovided support to their families back home, particularly after \nthe disaster, with inward private transfers rising by 8.9%.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is seen to moderate in the Cook Islands and pick up in \nSamoa and Tonga during the forecast period. \n\nThe Cook Islands economy is projected to grow by 6.0% \n\nin FY2019. Tourism and large infrastructure projects for \nwater supply and sanitation, renewable energy, and improved \ninternet connectivity will continue to contribute significantly \nto economic expansion. Growth is projected to slow further \nin FY2020 as tourism is constrained by low availability of \naccommodation. \n\nIn Samoa, growth is expected to accelerate in FY2019, \ndriven up as higher visitor arrivals boost growth in commerce, \nhotels, transport, and other activities ancillary to tourism. \nGrowth is forecast to increase further to 3.0% in FY2020 on \ncontinued growth in tourism but also strengthening growth in \ncommunications. The 2019 Pacific Games, which Samoa will \nhost in July 2019, are expected to provide further impetus. \n\nFollowing slow growth in FY2018 as a result of losses from \n\nCyclone Gita, Tonga is expected to enjoy higher economic \ngrowth in FY2019 and FY2020 thanks to reconstruction and \ninfrastructure projects in the pipeline. \n\nInflation expectations are mixed across the three \n\neconomies in the forecast period. Prices are seen to grow by \n1.0% in the Cook Islands and 2.0% in Samoa in FY2019, and \ninflation in both will converge at 1.5% in FY2020 as higher \nglobal food prices affect these import-dependent island \neconomies. In Tonga, inflation is expected to continue to \nhover at 5.3% in both FY2019 and FY2020 as the government \nramps\u00a0up construction projects. \n\nThe Government of the Cook Islands projects a fiscal \ndeficit equal to 1.9% of GDP in FY2019 to pay for an ambitious \ninvestment plan for water supply, renewable energy, and \ncommunications (Figure 3.38.4). In FY2020, these projects \nwill have progressed substantially, so a surplus equal to \n1.0% of GDP is projected. With improved tax collection \nand a growing economy, the government does not intend to \nfinance projects with loans except when it needs technical \nassistance for implementation. Continued economic growth \nand available cash balances should keep net public debt below \ntarget. Cash\u00a0reserves are expected to continue rising over the \nforecast\u00a0years.\n\nSamoa\u2019s fiscal deficit is budgeted to equal 3.5% of GDP in \n\nboth FY2019 and FY2020, in line with the government\u2019s fiscal \nstrategy to stimulate the economy with expansionary fiscal and \n\n\f3.38.4\u2002 Fiscal balance\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\n\nTonga\n\n% of GDP\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance & Economic \nManagement; Samoa Ministry of Finance; Tonga Ministry \nof Finance and National Planning.\n\n3.38.5\u2002 Visitor arrivals from Australia and \nNew Zealand to the South Pacific\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\nTotal from all markets\n\nThousand arrivals\n\n% change\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Australian Bureau of Statistics; Statistics \nNew\u00a0Zealand.\n\n338(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nmonetary policies. Meanwhile, it intends to keep its focus on \nrevenue collection through measures to improve compliance. \nTonga is forecast to post a deficit in both FY2019 and \n\nFY2020 on increased spending on infrastructure and \nreconstruction, which are expected to remain substantial \ncomponents of expenditure. Higher projected tax revenue in \nFY2020 is expected to narrow the fiscal deficit slightly.\n\nCook Islands current account surpluses are expected to \nexpand to the equivalent of 2.8% of GDP in FY2019 and 3.4% in \nFY2020. Growing tourism earnings are likely to offset higher \nimports of goods and services for public investment projects \nimplemented during the period. Samoa\u2019s current account is \nexpected to fall into deficit equal to 3.5% of GDP in FY2019, in \npart because of imports for the 2019 Pacific Games, the deficit \neasing to 3.0% in FY2020. Increased imports of goods for \nreconstruction are projected to push Tonga\u2019s current account \ninto deficit in FY2019. The deficit is expected to persist in \nFY2020 with the forecast resurgence in global food prices.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014ensuring sustainable \ngrowth in tourism\nThe South Pacific economies depend on tourism to drive \neconomic growth (Figure 3.38.5). Cook Islands exports of \nservices, largely tourism receipts, provided 49.6% of GDP on \naverage from FY2012 to FY2018. Growth in the Cook Islands \neconomy mirrors visitor arrivals. In Samoa as well, tourism is \ngrowing in importance despite challenges encountered in the \naftermath of a tsunami in September 2009. Tourism earnings \nin Samoa averaged 18.1% of GDP from FY2012 to FY2018, \nthe latter of which was a record year for tourism in Samoa \nwith earnings rising to 20.6% of GDP. The contribution of \ntourism in Tonga has grown steadily, albeit from a small base \nof only 7.0% in FY2010, reaching 11.5% in FY2017. All\u00a0three \neconomies face similar issues in their tourism industries: \nFirst is a need to improve infrastructure to ensure that the \nbenefits of tourism spread across the country. Second is to \nensure that infrastructure for tourism is sufficiently resilient, \nable to withstand the cyclones to which these economies are \nprone. Third is to keep tourism environmentally friendly and \nsustainable.\n\nTourism is constrained in the South Pacific \neconomies by underdeveloped infrastructure, which \nconfines and concentrates these industries in accessible \nareas. Consideration\u00a0should be given to policies that \nuse infrastructure development to encourage industry \ndiversification. Appropriate\u00a0infrastructure development will \ncatalyze private sector investment as it is attracted to new \nlocations around the country. The Cook Islands in particular \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSouth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002339\n\nis in a favorable fiscal position to support infrastructure \ndevelopment to spread tourism to outer islands. Samoa \nand Tonga should incorporate facilitative infrastructure \ninvestments in their longer-term tourism development plans.\nAlthough diversification supports resilience in industry, \nlong-term sustainability across the South Pacific economies \ndemands additional considerations, notably factoring \ndisaster resilience into investments in buildings and other \ninfrastructure. The Cook Islands has not had a major disaster \nrecently, but Samoa struggled to expand its tourism industry \nafter the 2009 tsunami, which pushed earnings to as low as \nthe equivalent of 16.6% of GDP in the years that followed. \nThis highlights the country\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters \nand the need for tourism to remain sustainable over the long \nrun. Tourism was the industry second most affected in Tonga \nafter the onslaught of Cyclone Gita. The government intends \nto adopt the policy in its reconstruction and recovery plan to \n\u201cbuild back better\u201d with the emphasis on resilient physical \ninfrastructure. \n\nThe growing importance of tourism and its expanding \nscale mean that its environmental and social impacts should \nnot be overlooked. Here, too, there is a need to embrace \nopportunities for sustainability. Governments can consider \nenhancing legislation to better address issues that threaten \nthe sustainability of the tourism industry and policies \npromoting sustainable tourism practices. The Vava\u2019u island \ngroup in Tonga, for example, is one of the country\u2019s popular \ndestinations, well known for watching whales and swimming \nwith them. While the government has passed laws regulating \nthese activities, rising demand has greatly increased the \nnumber of whale-watching operators. Industry leaders have \nexpressed concern over the increase in activity as noise \nand other environmental pollutants adversely affect whale \npopulations. \n\n\fSmall island economies\n\nEconomic  performance  in  the  three  small  island  economies  diverged,  with  growth \naccelerating  in  Tuvalu  and  stable  in  Kiribati  as  GDP  contracted  in  Nauru.  Infrastructure \nprojects  will  play  a  dominant  role  in  economic  activity  in  Nauru  and  continued  growth  in \nKiribati and Tuvalu. Inflation is expected to be fairly stable while current accounts weaken, \nwith Tuvalu going into deficit. Improving public service delivery while stemming fiscal drain \nis  necessary  as  reform  to  state-owned  enterprises  continues. \n\n3.39.1\u2002 GDP growth\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n36.5\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are fiscal years ending on 30 June of that year \nin Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year in Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati budget documents; Nauru budget \ndocuments; Tuvalu budget documents; Asian Development \nOutlook database; ADB estimates.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe economy of Kiribati grew by 2.3% in 2018 but at a bit \nless than half the average growth rate of 5.2% from 2015 to \n2017 (Figure 3.39.1). Public spending and projects financed \nby development partners continue to be the main drivers \nof economic growth. And, while growth in fishing revenue \nslowed from 10.0% in 2017 to 0.7% in 2018, fisheries remain an \nimportant source of national revenue, providing 71.7% of total \nrevenue in 2018. \n\nIn Nauru, the economy is estimated to have contracted as \nthe Regional Processing Centre (RPC), an Australian-funded \nfacility for asylum seekers, scaled down and an overseas \nrefugee resettlement program commenced. Meanwhile, \nphosphate exports remained weak. The RPC scale-down was, \nhowever, slower than initially expected. The facility has been \nthe principal source of economic activity in recent years, \ndriving revenue growth, including from visa fees and income \ntaxes paid by expatriate workers, and from consequent demand \nfor local services, as well as infrastructure investment. \n\nGrowth in Tuvalu accelerated to 4.3% in 2018, driven by \nhigher government spending on large infrastructure projects \nand new housing in preparation for hosting the Polynesian \nLeaders Group Summit, which was held in June 2018, and the \nupcoming Pacific Islands Forum, to be held in September\u00a02019. \nIncreased spending was supported by recovery in fishing \nlicense revenue, which posted an 84.8% jump in 2018 with the \nreceipt of a one-off payment from a subregional pooling scheme \nlast year.\n\nInflation rose in Kiribati in 2018 on a pickup in economic \nactivity brought about by sustained public spending and higher \nwages.

Meanwhile, inflation in Nauru continued \nto slow under economic contraction. Inflation in Tuvalu also \ndecelerated to 1.8% in line with global food price movements. \nThe current account surplus in Kiribati narrowed further \n\nas imports rose and fishing revenue moderated. The current \naccount balance of Tuvalu also remained in surplus in 2018. \nHigher inflows of fishing license fees offset increased imports \nof goods to supply government infrastructure investments \n(Figure 3.39.2). \n\nThe fiscal balance in Kiribati posted a deficit in 2018 equal \nto 20.1% of GDP (Figure 3.39.3). Increased spending on wages \nby 33.9% and the acquisition of aircraft for Air Kiribati more \nthan offset higher revenue from fishing licenses and 4.2% \nhigher revenue from taxes, which showed up as a surplus in the \nrecurrent budget.\n\nIn Nauru, total revenues collected in fiscal year 2018 \n(FY2018, ended 30 June 2018) were 1.2% higher than in \nthe previous year, mainly reflecting higher tax and nontax \nrevenue collected from operations associated with the RPC. \nThis contrasted with earlier government projections of \nlower revenue based on the assumed faster scaling-down of \nRPC operations. This income supported higher expenditure, \nincluding capital spending, as well as contributions to the \nNauru Intergenerational Trust Fund. The fiscal surplus \nnevertheless shrank by half from the equivalent of 19.3% of \nGDP in FY2017 to 8.8%, including trust fund contributions. \nBy year-end, the government\u2019s cash buffer was above the \nInternational Monetary Fund recommendation of cover for \n2\u00a0months of spending not associated with the RPC. \n\nhad a fiscal surplus equal to 33.9% of GDP in 2018 thanks to \nstrong recovery in fishing license revenue and lower operating \nexpenditure. \n\nEconomic prospects \nThe pace of growth in Kiribati is expected to be sustained in \nthe next 2 years as continued infrastructure spending offsets \nthe slowdown in fishing revenue. In October 2018, Kiribati \nsecured a grant from development partners that will provide to \nSouth Tarawa, the capital, a seawater desalination plant and a \nsolar photovoltaic plant, as well as rehabilitate and expand the \nwater supply network. \n\nNauru is expected to experience less severe economic \ncontraction in FY2019 than in FY2018, with the Nauru Port \nproject having commenced construction in January 2019 and \nable to cushion the slowdown caused by the continued scaling \ndown of the RPC and resettlement of refugees.

Fiscal discipline will \nbe critical in FY2020 as RPC-derived revenue is uncertain and \nrevenue from fishing license fees is projected to drop from the \nexceptionally elevated receipts in FY2019. \n\nTuvalu\u2019s economy is projected to accelerate in the next \n2 years with the implementation of infrastructure projects \nsupported by development partners. In September 2018, it \nreceived additional grant for an ongoing project to climate-\nproof a harbor in Niutao, a reef island in the north. \n\nInflation is forecast to accelerate in Kiribati in 2019 and \n2020 with expected increases in food prices (Figure 3.39.4). \nIt\u00a0is likewise projected higher in Tuvalu over the next 2 years, \npushed up by increased public sector wages and by ongoing and \nfuture infrastructure projects. In Nauru, inflation is expected \nto continue easing as the economy contracts and global \ncommodity prices, especially for oil, remain low.\n\nThe fiscal deficit in Kiribati is expected to persist, \nequal to 23.2% of GDP in 2019 and 20.8% in 2020, as recent \nunexpected bounty from fishing revenue is expected to \nrevert to slower growth or decline under less favorable \nweather. Further, the government\u2019s commitment to support \nAir\u00a0Kiribati as it establishes its own international operations \nwill incur substantial fiscal costs. Tuvalu will fall into a fiscal \ndeficit equal to 1.1% of GDP in 2019 as spending continues on \ninfrastructure for the regional summit and as fishing revenue \ndeclines significantly, as projected. However, higher tax \nrevenue and lower spending in 2020 are expected to restore \ngovernment finances to a surplus equal to 1.4% of GDP.\n\nThe volatility in fishing license revenues will be significant \n\nfor the current account balance of Kiribati, with the surplus \nshrinking further in 2019 and 2020 (Figure 3.39.5). Similarly \nin Tuvalu, weaker fishing revenue inflows in the next 2 years \nand sustained growth in imports of goods will push the current \naccount into deficit in 2019 and widen the deficit in 2020.\nRisks to the outlook include delays in implementing \ninfrastructure projects. For Nauru, any change in expected \narrangements for the RPC could significantly affect economic \nactivity in either direction. Fiscal sustainability remains a \nchallenge as the main sources of revenues remain narrow and \nare highly volatile. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014pursuing reform \nto state enterprises\nState-owned enterprises (SOEs) provide essential services \nsuch as water supply and energy utilities, especially in remote \nareas.

SOE reform to promote fiscal \nsustainability and responsiveness must ensure the continued \nprovision of essential services while minimizing the fiscal \nburden on the government. \n\nMaintaining fiscal sustainability is a longstanding \n\nchallenge for Kiribati. Part of the recent increase in recurrent \ngovernment expenditure has been to fund higher subsidies \nfor SOEs. The government has made strides in consolidating \nand downsizing SOEs involved in copra production and trade, \nand it managed to sell its telecom SOE, but there is a need to \ncontinue pursuing improvement in the quality and relevance of \nSOE financial reports. Further, the government should lay out \na plan to enhance the sustainability of its SOEs by improving \nSOE governance and also, for example, recalibrating tariffs \nfor water supply and sanitation services. Finally, SOEs should \nnot be exempted from the value-added tax to better level the \nplaying field for the private sector and encourage its growth.\nIn Nauru, SOEs play important roles in the economy and \n\nare significant employers. However, weak SOE governance \nputs at risk the sustainability of the large portion of public \nassets and infrastructure that SOEs manage. Poorly performing \nSOEs can absorb large amounts of scarce capital and divert \ngovernment resources away from critical social investments \ninto health care and education. The government has started \nto tackle these challenges. Reform to the state-owned power \nutility has reduced fiscal costs and made electricity supply \nmore reliable. The cabinet approved an SOE policy in 2018 that \nestablishes a framework for SOE reporting, provides guidelines \non director appointments and community service obligations, \nand calls for the establishment of a central monitoring unit to \noversee SOE performance. Comprehensive SOE legislation is \nplanned. \n\nAlthough Tuvalu\u2019s outlook remains generally optimistic, \n\nthe weak balance sheets of its SOEs pose risks to the fiscal \nbalance because SOEs rely heavily on government subsidies \n(Figure\u00a03.39.6). The latest forecast from the International \nMonetary Fund indicates that fiscal support to SOEs will \nincrease to equal about 4% of GDP in the medium term. \nThis\u00a0makes it imperative that SOEs strengthen their financial \nperformance and so mitigate their drag on the national \nbudget. Specific reforms would require the government to \npay its outstanding obligations to SOEs; introduce differential \nelectricity tariffs for public and commercial entities to increase \nthe revenue of Tuvalu Electricity Corporation, an SOE; adopt a \nmore transparent approach to annual fiscal transfers to SOEs; \nand closely monitor any joint ventures that SOEs join. \n\n3.39.5\u2002 Current account balance\n\nKiribati\nTuvalu\n\n% of GDP\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n3.39.6\u2002 Returns on state-owned electricity \n\nenterprises, 2015\n\nReturn on assets\nReturn on equity\n\n9.4\n\n6.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n-5.9\n\n-13.0\n\nTUV KIR COO SOL\n\nSAM FIJ\n\nTON\n\nCOO = Cook Islands Te Aponga Uira O Tumu-Te \nVarovaro (power authority), FIJ = Fiji Electricity Authority, \nKIR\u00a0=\u00a0Kiribati Public Utilities Board, SAM = Samoa Electric \nPower Corporation, SOL = Solomon Power, TON = Tonga \nPower Limited, TUV = Tuvalu Electricity Corporation. \nNote: The figures for Solomon Islands and Tonga are \n2016\u00a0data.\nSource: Pacific Power Association. 2015 and 2016. \nPacific\u00a0Power Utilities: Power Benchmarking 2015 and \n2016 Fiscal Years.\n\n\f\fSTATISTICAL APPENDIX\n\n\fStatistical notes and tables\n\nThe statistical appendix presents selected economic indicators for the \n45\u00a0developing member economies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin 18 tables. The economies are grouped into five subregions: Central Asia, \nEast\u00a0Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Most of the tables \ncontain historical data from 2014 to 2018; some have forecasts for 2019 \nand\u00a02020.\n\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in \nstatistical methodology, definitions, coverage, and practices make full \ncomparability impossible. The national income accounts section is based \non the United\u00a0Nations System of National Accounts, while the data on \nbalance of payments use International Monetary Fund (IMF) accounting \nstandards. Historical data were obtained from official sources, statistical \npublications, and databases, as well as the documents of ADB, the IMF, and \nthe World\u00a0Bank. For some economies, data for 2018 were estimated from \nthe latest available information. Projections for 2019 and 2020 are generally \nADB estimates made on the bases of available quarterly or monthly data, \nthough some projections are from governments.\n\nMost economies report by calendar year. The following record their \ngovernment finance data by fiscal year: Brunei Darussalam; Fiji; Hong\u00a0Kong, \nChina; the Kyrgyz Republic; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao\u00a0PDR); Singapore; Tajikistan; Thailand; and Uzbekistan. South\u00a0Asian \ncountries (except for Maldives and Sri Lanka), the Cook\u00a0Islands, the \nFederated States of Micronesia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, the Republic\u00a0of \nMarshall Islands, Samoa, and Tonga report all variables by fiscal year. \nIn\u00a0Myanmar, there is a statistical break in 2018 caused by a change \nin the fiscal year, with fiscal 2017 ending 31 March 2017, transitional \nfiscal\u00a0year\u00a02018 lasting only 6 months to 30 September 2018, and fiscal 2019 \nending 30\u00a0September 2019.\n\nRegional and subregional averages or totals are provided for seven \n\ntables (A1, A2, A6, A11, A12, A13, and A14). For tables A1, A2, A6, A11, \nA12, and A14, averages were computed using weights derived from gross \nnational income (GNI) in current US dollars following the World Bank Atlas \nmethod. The GNI data for 2014\u20132017 were obtained from the World Bank\u2019s \nWorld Development Indicators online. Weights for 2017 were carried over \nthrough 2020. The GNI data for the Cook Islands and Taipei,China were \nestimated using the Atlas conversion factor. For Table A13, the regional and \nsubregional totals were computed using a consistent sum, which means that \nif country data were missing for a given year, the sum excluded that country.\n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002347\n\nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. These tables show data on output \n\ngrowth, production, and demand. Changes to the national income \naccounts series for some countries were made to accommodate a change \nin source, methodology, and/or base year. The series for Afghanistan, \nBhutan, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan reflects fiscal year data, rather \nthan calendar year data, while those for Timor-Leste reflect GDP \nexcluding the offshore petroleum sector. In Myanmar, fiscal 2018 growth \nrates were computed in reference to April\u2013September 2017, and growth \nrates for 2019 onward were computed in reference to the full 12 months \npreceding the fiscal year.\n\nTable A1: Growth rate of GDP (% per year). The table shows annual \n\ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, or \nbasic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of value added \nby all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes less \nsubsidies on imports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar taxes. \nConstant\u00a0factor cost measures differ from market price measures in \nthat they exclude taxes on production and include subsidies. Basic\u00a0price \nvaluation is the factor cost plus some taxes on production, such as \nproperty and payroll taxes, and less some subsidies, such as for labor but \nnot for products. Most economies use constant market price valuation. \nPakistan\u00a0use constant factor costs, while Fiji and Maldives use basic prices.\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is defined as \nGDP at constant prices divided by the population. Data on per capita \ngross national income in US dollar terms (Atlas method) for 2017 are also \nshown, sourced from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators \nonline. The\u00a0data\u00a0for the Cook Islands and Taipei,China were estimated \nusing the Atlas conversion factor.\n\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (% per year).\n\nThe\u00a0table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture at \nconstant prices and agriculture\u2019s share of GDP in 2017 at current prices. \nThe\u00a0agriculture sector comprises plant crops, livestock, poultry, fisheries, \nand forestry.\n\nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year).\n\nThe\u00a0table provides the growth rates of value added in industry at constant \nprices and industry\u2019s share of GDP in 2017 at current prices. This\u00a0sector \ncomprises manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and, generally, \nconstruction and utilities.\n\nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (% per year).\nThe\u00a0table gives the growth rates of value added in services at constant \nprices and services\u2019 share of GDP in 2017 at current prices. Subsectors \ngenerally include trade, banking, finance, real estate, and similar \nbusinesses, as well as public administration. For Malaysia, electricity, gas, \nwater supply, and waste management are included under services.\n\nTable A6: Inflation (% per year). Data on inflation rates are period \n\naverages. The inflation rates presented are based on consumer price \nindexes. The consumer price indexes of the following economies are for \na given city only: Cambodia is for Phnom Penh, the Marshall Islands is \nfor Majuro, and Solomon Islands is for Honiara. For Uzbekistan, data \nfrom 2016 onwards reflect the IMF fixed weight method of estimating \n\n\f348(cid:13)(cid:13)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nthe consumer price index, as adopted by the government, which has not \nrevised annual average inflation data for 2014\u20132016; for the earlier period, \nIMF\u00a0average consumer price data are used.\n\nTable A7: Change in money supply (% per year). This table tracks the \n\nannual percentage change in the end-of-period supply of broad\u00a0money \nas represented by M2 for most countries. M2 is defined as the sum of \nM1 and quasi-money, where M1 denotes currency in circulation plus \ndemand deposits, and quasi-money consists of time and savings deposits \nincluding foreign currency deposits. For Georgia and India, broad money is \nrepresented by M3, which adds longer-term time deposits.\n\nTables A8, A9, and A10: Government finance. These tables give \nthe revenue and expenditure transactions and the fiscal balance of the \ncentral government expressed as a percentage of GDP in nominal terms. \nFor\u00a0Cambodia, Georgia, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, and Tajikistan, transactions are those \nreported by the general government.\n\nTable A8: Central government revenue (% of GDP). Central government \n\nrevenue comprises all nonrepayable receipts, both current and capital, \nplus grants. These amounts are computed as a percentage of GDP at \ncurrent prices. For the Republic of Korea, revenue excludes social security \ncontributions. For Singapore, revenue includes the contribution from net \ninvestment returns. For Kazakhstan, revenue includes transfers from the \nnational fund. Grants are excluded in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Malaysia, \nand Thailand; revenue from disinvestment is included for India; and only \ncurrent revenue is included for Bangladesh.\n\nTable A9: Central government expenditure (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment expenditure comprises all nonrepayable payments to both \ncurrent and capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts are computed \nas a share of GDP at current prices. For Thailand, expenditure refers to \nbudgetary expenditure excluding externally financed expenditure and \nborrowing. For Tajikistan, expenditure includes externally financed public \ninvestment programs. One-time expenditures are excluded for\u00a0Pakistan.\n\nTable A10: Fiscal balance of central government (% of GDP). \n\nFiscal\u00a0balance is the difference between central government revenue and \nexpenditure. The difference is computed as a share of GDP at current \nprices. Data variation may arise from statistical discrepancy when, \nfor\u00a0example, balancing items for both central and local governments, and \nfrom differences in the concept used in the individual computations of \nrevenue and expenditure as compared with the calculation of the fiscal \nbalance. For\u00a0Fiji, the fiscal balance excludes loan repayment. For\u00a0Georgia, \nfiscal balance is calculated according to the Government Finance \nStatistics Manual 2001 of the IMF. For Thailand, the fiscal balance is \nthe cash balance of the combined budgetary and nonbudgetary balances. \nFor Uzbekistan, the augmented fiscal balance includes the Fund for \nReconstruction and Development. Some off-budget accounts are included in \nthe computation of the fiscal balance for Turkmenistan.\n\nTables A11, A12, A13, and A14: Balance of payments. These tables show \nannual flows of selected international economic transactions of countries as \nrecorded in the balance of payments.\n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002349\n\nTables A11 and A12: Growth rates of merchandise exports and imports \n\n(% per year). These tables show the annual growth rates of exports and \nimports of goods. Data are in million US dollars, primarily obtained from \nthe balance-of-payments accounts of each economy. Export data are \nreported free on board. Import data are reported free on board except \nfor the following economies, which value them based on cost, insurance, \nand freight: Afghanistan; Bhutan; Hong Kong, China; Georgia; India; the \nLao\u00a0PDR; Myanmar; Singapore; and Thailand.\n\nTable A13: Trade balance ($ million). The trade balance is the \ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. \nFigures\u00a0in this table are based on the export and import amounts used to \ngenerate tables A11 and A12.\n\nTable A14: Current account balance (% of GDP). The current account \n\nbalance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, net trade in \nservices and factor income, and net transfers. The values reported are \ndivided by GDP at current prices in US dollars. For Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nand Viet Nam, official transfers are excluded from the current account \nbalance.\n\nTable A15: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average). Annual \n\naverage exchange rates are quoted as the local currency per US dollar.\n\nTable A16: Gross international reserves ($ million). Gross international \nreserves are defined as the US dollar value of holdings of foreign exchange, \nspecial drawing rights, reserve position in the IMF, and gold at the \nend of a given period. For Taipei,China, this heading refers to foreign \nexchange reserves only. In some economies, the rubric is foreign assets \nand reserves of national monetary authorities and national oil funds, e.g., \nnet\u00a0foreign\u00a0reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan. The data for India are as \nof 10\u00a0March\u00a02019.\n\nTable A17: External debt outstanding ($ million). For most economies, \n\nexternal debt outstanding, public and private, includes short-term debt, \nmedium- and long-term debt, and IMF credit. For Cambodia and the \nLao PDR, only public external debt is reported. Intercompany lending is \nexcluded in Georgia. For the Kyrgyz Republic, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and \nThailand, the figures for 2018 are as of the end of September.\n\nTable A18: Debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and services). \n\nThis\u00a0table generally presents the total debt service payments of each \neconomy, which comprise principal repayments (excluding on short-term \ndebt) and interest payments on outstanding external debt, as a percentage of \nexports of goods and services. For Cambodia and the Lao PDR, debt service \nrefers to external public debt only.

Global trade and economic activity weakened toward the end of\u00a02018, \nslowing growth in many economies in the region. The outlook is cloudy with risks that tilt to the downside. \nA drawn-out trade conflict could undermine trade and investment in the region, and US fiscal policy \nand the consequences of a disorderly Brexit could weigh on growth in the advanced economies and the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China. Though the risk of sharp increases in US interest rates has subsided, policy\u00a0makers \nmust stay vigilant.\n\nDisasters are shaped by natural hazards and the dynamics of the economy, society, and environment in which \nthey occur. They pose a growing threat to development and prosperity in the region, their consequences \ndisproportionately severe in developing countries, especially for the poor and marginalized. As developing\u00a0Asia \nis home to more than four-fifths of the people affected by disasters globally in the past 2 decades, the \nregion must strengthen its disaster resilience. This means integrating disaster risk reduction into national \ndevelopment and investment plans, spending more on prevention for a better balance with spending on \nrescue and recovery, and pooling risk through insurance and reinsurance.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific,  \nwhile sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members \n\u201449 from the region.
