Recent estimates suggest that 40% of all Ni-\nVanuatu and 51% of those living in the rural areas have incomes\nbelow this level.\n\nDisadvantaged Ni-Vanuatu suffer from \u201cpoverty of opportu-\nnity,\u201d in terms of a lack of access to basic services, jobs, and educa-\ntion. To address this, the government is striving to understand the\nnature of hardship in Vanuatu and develop ways to combat it.\n\nIn 2002, the government initiated a \u201cParticipatory Hardship\nAssessment.\u201d Ni-Vanuatu from all walks of life, especially the poor,\nwere asked to describe poverty and hardship from their point of\nview and suggest the most important priority actions to improve\ntheir lives. Interviews were held at the household level, and focus\ngroup discussions and workshops were held with the communities.\nThe Department of Economic and Social Development led\n\nthe effort to consult with traditional and elected officials and\nwomen and youth leaders in 12 village and settlement communi-\nties in Torba, Penama, Shefa, and Tafea Provinces. The sites were\n\nDisadvantaged\n\nNi-Vanuatu\n\nsuffer from\n\n\u201cpoverty of\n\nopportunity\u201d\n\n1\n\n\fselected to represent both rural and urban areas, various levels of\naccess to services, and geographic regions. The assessment was\nfunded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\nThe results of the assessment were consistent with the na-\ntional priorities contained in the Vanuatu Government\u2019s Medium\nTerm Development Framework (MTDF), which are to\nimprove governance and public service delivery,\nimprove the lives of people in the rural areas,\nincrease private sector investment,\n\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 enable greater participation, and\n\u00b7\n\nincrease income equality.\n\nIs Hardship Really a\nProblem in Vanuatu?\nT he existence of hardship in Vanuatu is difficult for some to\n\nunderstand and accept. Communities have always taken\ncare of all their members, sharing food and goods between\nthe richer and poorer people. But this traditional system is strained\nby modernization, especially the growing need for cash, the shift\naway from subsistence farming, a growing population, and move-\nment of people to towns.\n\nThere has been considerable debate about the presence of\n\nThe traditional\n\nsystem is\n\nstrained by\n\nmodernization\n\nHouses  made\nHouses  made\nHouses  made\nHouses  made\nHouses  made\nof  scrap\nof  scrap\nof  scrap\nof  scrap\nof  scrap\nm a t e r i a l s\nm a t e r i a l s\nm a t e r i a l s\nm a t e r i a l s\nm a t e r i a l s\n\nMale Farmer, 49 Years Old\n\n\u201cI was born here in Kweyegmagde vil-\nlage and have lived for most of my life\nhere as a farmer.

Hardship, how-\never, is widely perceived to exist, primarily through lack of, or lim-\nited access to, basic services such as education, health, good roads,\nand safe drinking water.\n\nThe personal stories in this booklet show the desperate situa-\n\ntions some people face. Those who do not have jobs, skills, or any\nway to earn cash are suffering. Their dignity and pride are\nwounded, and some have turned to crime, prostitution, and drugs\nto survive. It is important to listen to their stories and strive to\nunderstand the nature of hardship in Vanuatu. Only then can effec-\ntive strategies be developed to improve the lives of the poor and\ndisadvantaged.\n\nWhat is Hardship?\nThe primary goal of the assessment was to identify the\n\npeople\u2019s perceptions of poverty and hardship by talking to\nkey community leaders (chiefs, elders, church leaders),\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\fselected to represent both rural and urban areas, various levels of\naccess to services, and geographic regions.

Most people consulted defined poverty as a\nstate of \u201chaving nothing\u201d (no gat samting), \u201cbeing hopeless,\u201d and\n\u201cstruggling for survival.\u201d Communities described hardship (Laef I\nhad tumas) as \u201ctemporary and manageable life difficulties.\u201d Hard-\nship was defined as\n\n\u00b7 poor living conditions,\n\u00b7\ninability to get jobs,\n\u00b7 cannot afford prices of goods,\n\u00b7 cannot afford school fees and materials,\n\u00b7\nstruggling to provide for family needs,\n\u00b7 difficulty accessing health services, and\n\u00b7 \u201cworrying about lack of money all the time.\u201d\nNi-Vanuatu mentioned difficult situations such as rebuilding\nafter a cyclone and not being able to afford to buy goods, especially\nwhen the price of copra drops or they lose their jobs. They also cited\nthe difficulty of coping with bad roads and the absence of ships or\nvehicles to transport their produce to the market.\n\nMost communities consulted said that hardship has worsened\nover the last five years, while a smaller number said it has improved\n(see Figure 1). The reasons cited were higher prices of goods and\nservices. Those who perceived that life has improved cited the\ninstallation of much needed power lines, telephone facilities, and\nbetter roads in their communities as reasons for improvement.\nThis was particularly true in Tanna in Tafea Province and South\nAmbae in Penama Province. Women\u2019s situations were seen to be\nslowly improving. This was mainly due to recognition of women\u2019s\ninvolvement and increasing role in community and church activi-\nties as well as improved access to education and, therefore, im-\nproved job opportunities.\n\nFigu re 1.

I am married and have two\nchildren. Our daily living depends on\nthe land we have and the food crops\nthat we grow. Our food gardens are\nlocated a good 1 to 2 hours\u2019 walk from\nthe village. Areas around the village are\ncurrently used for cash cropping with\ncoconuts and cocoa.\n\n\u201cWe do not worry about food too\n\nmuch as we have big food gardens\n(taro, banana, vegetables, etc.) and this\ncan support us for quite some time.\nOur main concern is cash income for\nschool fees, soap, kerosene, clothing,\nand transport costs for bringing goods\nto the village.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have coconut planta-\n\ntions, the money earned from copra\nproduction is low compared to people\nwho are earning money through the\nsale of kava. Some people within this\nvillage do earn income through the sale\nof their food crops, mats, and baskets.\n\n\u201cMy family\u2019s only source of income is\nthe sale of copra. The little money we\nearn is used for what we need at home,\nsome is given to the church, and some\nis set aside for the future or an emer-\ngency such as a sick child.\n\n\u201cThe other problem that we have\nhad in this village for quite some time is\nwater. We currently depend on rainwa-\nter. Long dry spells and shortages of\nwater means we have to walk long\ndistances to get to the nearest creek or\nspring along the sea coast.\n\n\u201cThe rural water supply section of\n\nthe provincial government built a con-\ncrete water tank for this community and\nthat had helped out a bit. Each house-\nhold is also building its own concrete\ntank to reduce the pressure on the com-\nmunity tank. I hope that one day the\nprovincial government and central\ngovernment can come up with a proper\nwater supply system not only for this\ncommunity but other communities\naround this part of the island.\u201d\n\n4\n\nWorse\n\nImproving Same\n\n5\n\n\f\u201cHaving noth-\n\ning,\u201d \u201cbeing\n\nhopeless,\u201d\n\n\u201cstruggling for\n\nsurvival\u201d\n\nwomen, youth, and people who were identified as suffering from\npoverty and hardship.

We\nmoved to a settlement in Port Vila\nwhen I was 8 years old. I went to\nschool in Port Vila but never made it to\nClass 6 due to lack of money to pay for\nmy studies. I was 12 years old when I\nleft school. My parents were struggling\nto raise us, to make sure we had food,\nclothing, and other necessities while\nother families seemed to have very\ncomfortable lives. I was very jealous of\nthese families because I had such a\nhard life.\n\n\u201cI became an obnoxious youth,\ngoing to nightclubs and getting drunk,\nlooking for ways to enjoy my life, but\nsomehow always ending up in fights.\nAs a result, I was thrown into jail fre-\nquently. Soon I became involved in a lot\nof break-ins as well as stealing kava and\n\ngreen snail that I would trade for cash to\nbuy alcohol, cigarettes, and more kava.\nThe police were getting tired of seeing\nme in prison regularly so they asked my\nChief to intervene. I was already ranked\nas one of their worst criminals. The Chief\nsent me to my home island for five years\nwhere the community there saw me as\na threat. When I returned to Port Vila, I\nresumed my activities of stealing and\nstreet fighting.\n\n\u201cThen, I got married and had five\nchildren. Watching them grow up made\nme think about my lifestyle. I don't want\nmy children to follow in my miserable\nfootsteps. I still think, however, that I\nhave a hard life and must fight to sur-\nvive; even if it would mean sending\nsomeone on the streets to the hospital\nfor their wallet. How else can I support\nmy children?\u201d\n\n14\n\ncal skills such as carpentry and auto mechanics, and secretarial,\ncooking, and dressmaking skills would benefit the increasing\nnumber of youth drop outs and \u201cpush-outs\u201d in the villages and\nurban settlements.\n\nRoles\n\nParticipation of the community in development is important to\nensure that all sectors of society have a voice in decision making\nand a stake in the success of the initiatives. By working together to\nagree on priorities, establish roles, and monitor progress, real im-\nprovements can be made in the people\u2019s daily lives. During the\nconsultations, the people suggested that the government adopt a\nprogram to enhance the delivery of information to communities\nand feedback on community issues and priorities.

The people consulted also said they need help in resolving\nland disputes and addressing social issues such as excessive kava\ndrinking.\n\nCapacity Building Needs\n\nPeople said business management, cattle farming, and fund-raising\nskills are needed to develop local entrepreneurs. Information on\nhow to obtain clean drinking water and proper nutrition is needed\nto prevent the spread of illnesses and improve health. Knowledge\nand skills to improve schools was identified as necessary to improve\nthe quality of education for village children. Road maintenance\nskills were seen as crucial for maintaining village access to markets\nand services. Improved knowledge of fishing and farming would\ngenerate more income for rural households. Lastly, access to techni-\n\nHelp is needed\n\nto develop local\n\nentrepreneurs\n\nMale Criminal, 42 Years Old\n\n\u201cI was born in Shefa Province into a\nfamily of 10 boys and 5 girls. We\nmoved to a settlement in Port Vila\nwhen I was 8 years old. I went to\nschool in Port Vila but never made it to\nClass 6 due to lack of money to pay for\nmy studies. I was 12 years old when I\nleft school. My parents were struggling\nto raise us, to make sure we had food,\nclothing, and other necessities while\nother families seemed to have very\ncomfortable lives. I was very jealous of\nthese families because I had such a\nhard life.\n\n\u201cI became an obnoxious youth,\ngoing to nightclubs and getting drunk,\nlooking for ways to enjoy my life, but\nsomehow always ending up in fights.\nAs a result, I was thrown into jail fre-\nquently. Soon I became involved in a lot\nof break-ins as well as stealing kava and\n\ngreen snail that I would trade for cash to\nbuy alcohol, cigarettes, and more kava.\nThe police were getting tired of seeing\nme in prison regularly so they asked my\nChief to intervene. I was already ranked\nas one of their worst criminals. The Chief\nsent me to my home island for five years\nwhere the community there saw me as\na threat. When I returned to Port Vila, I\nresumed my activities of stealing and\nstreet fighting.\n\n\u201cThen, I got married and had five\nchildren. Watching them grow up made\nme think about my lifestyle. I don't want\nmy children to follow in my miserable\nfootsteps. I still think, however, that I\nhave a hard life and must fight to sur-\nvive; even if it would mean sending\nsomeone on the streets to the hospital\nfor their wallet. How else can I support\nmy children?\u201d\n\n14\n\ncal skills such as carpentry and auto mechanics, and secretarial,\ncooking, and dressmaking skills would benefit the increasing\nnumber of youth drop outs and \u201cpush-outs\u201d in the villages and\nurban settlements.\n\nRoles\n\nParticipation of the community in development is important to\nensure that all sectors of society have a voice in decision making\nand a stake in the success of the initiatives. By working together to\nagree on priorities, establish roles, and monitor progress, real im-\nprovements can be made in the people\u2019s daily lives. During the\nconsultations, the people suggested that the government adopt a\nprogram to enhance the delivery of information to communities\nand feedback on community issues and priorities. They also sug-\ngested that the government assist communities to organize them-\nselves, prepare plans, and implement activities to ensure their\nactive participation in future development projects or initiatives,\nperhaps through the provision of leadership skills and project man-\nagement training.\n\nMost people expect the government to provide financial assis-\ntance, equipment, and facilities, as well as for government officials\n\nLivelihood  skills\nLivelihood  skills\nLivelihood  skills\nLivelihood  skills\nLivelihood  skills\nneed  to  be\nneed  to  be\nneed  to  be\nneed  to  be\nneed  to  be\nstrengthened\nstrengthened\nstrengthened\nstrengthened\nstrengthened\n\nEveryone has a\n\nrole to play in\n\nreducing hard-\n\nship\n\n15\n\n\fto be physically present  in their communities.

This can help improve the effectiveness of future\nefforts.\n\nThe most commonly cited community initiatives to address\n\nhardship were\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nrepresentation to provincial governments and members of\nparliament to access needed government services; and,\ncommunity fund-raising activities, for example, selling\nkava and laplap (made from taro, banana, or cassava) to\nraise money for school fees, and organizing youth and\nwomen\u2019s groups.\n\nRegarding government initiatives, most community members\nwere aware of the Rural Economic Development Initiative (REDI)\nPlan to help address poverty and hardship; however, they said they\nare still waiting for its actual delivery. They said the following\ngovernment agencies were providing services to improve the stan-\ndard of living of the communities:  Department of Public Works,\nMinistry of Health, and Ministry of Agriculture, Quarantine, For-\nestry & Fisheries.\n\nDuring crises, community members said they generally do not\n\ndepend upon the government for assistance. Instead, they rely\nmainly on their family and community institutions, such as\nchurches, tribes, women\u2019s and youth organizations, and traditional\nleaders.\n\nPeople depend\n\non their family,\n\nchurch, and\n\ntribe rather\n\nthan the\n\ngovernment\n\n16\n\nContact Information\n\nFor more information about hardship-reduction activities in Vanuatu, contact\n\nDepartment of Economic & Social Development\nMinistry of Finance & Economic Management\nPrivate Mail Bag 008\nRepublic of Vanuatu\nTel (678) 22043/22605, Fax (678) 23087\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nPrincipal Researcher/Writer Ma.
