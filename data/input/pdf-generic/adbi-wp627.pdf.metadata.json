INTRODUCTION \nWhile coeducation is the standard practice in schools in the United States (US) since \nthe 19th century, academic interest is once again renewed on the debated issue of \ngender composition in learning environments. Several recent studies have shown more \ngenerally that gender peer effects in schools affect educational outcomes (Hill 2015; \nHoxby 2000; Lavy and Schlosser 2011).1 Direct evidence on single-sex education also \nlargely confirms the benefits of homogeneous gender peer settings (Eisenkopf et al. \n2015; Jackson 2012; Lee et al. 2014). Moreover, several studies have found that the \ngender composition of siblings also affects educational outcomes, but the evidence  \non gender peer effects of siblings is more mixed (Anelli and Peri 2015; Brunello and  \nDe Paola 2013; Butcher and Case 1994; Hauser and Kuo 1998; Parish and Willis \n1993).  However,  most  of  the  economic  literature  on  sibling  effects  focuses  on \noutcomes at later stages in life, while gender peer effects of siblings may arguably be \nmost pronounced before children make regular contact with other peer groups. \nThis paper studies the effect of opposite sex siblings on cognitive and noncognitive \nskills of children in the US at the onset of formal education. More specifically, we use \ndata on skills of kindergarten and first grade students from the Kindergarten Class of \n1998\u20131999 of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K). Our empirical strategy \nrests on the assumption that the sex composition of the two firstborns in families with at \nleast two children is exogenous, conditional on other covariates including the total \nnumber of siblings in a family. \nWe find that boys with a sister exhibit significantly higher math and reading skills in \nkindergarten, and better learning skills and self-control, than boys with a brother. The \noverall effect on girls is insignificant, which is in line with evidence from other studies \non  gender  peer  effects  (e.g.,  Lee  et  al.  2014). We  also  find  some  indication  for  \na fade-out of the effect for boys. The effects on reading skills, learning skills, and  \nself-control at the end of first grade are significantly below the effects in kindergarten \nand not significantly different from zero. This quick fade-out might be explained by  \nthe gain in importance of other peer groups during formal education such as friends  \nor classmates. \n2.  EMPIRICAL STRATEGY \nWe use data from the ECLS-K, which was administered by the National Center for \nEducation  Statistics  (Tourangeau  et  al.  2002).  The  study  is  representative  of  the \nkindergarten population in 1998\u20131999 and follows children from kindergarten to eighth \ngrade. Children are repeatedly given reading and math tests, and assessments of their \nnoncognitive abilities are made. We analyze the public-use data from the first three \nwaves\u2014fall kindergarten, spring kindergarten, and first grade.2 We restrict our sample \nto the first two children of a family with at least two children. Our final estimation \nsample comprises 9,402 children first surveyed in the fall of their kindergarten year. \n   \n                                                \n1  The evidence on gender peer effects is, however, largely confined to primary and secondary education \nand cannot necessarily be extrapolated to higher education (Oosterbeek and van Ewijk 2014).  \n2  We focus on the early waves because subsequent attrition leads to a sizable reduction in the sample \nsize, and a shift toward children of higher socioeconomic status. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 627  Cyron, Schwerdt, and Viarengo \n \nWe estimate the effect of having a sibling of the opposite sex based on the following \naugmented educational production function: \n  (1) \n\u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\nw\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56h\ud835\udc61e=re\ud835\udefc y+it \ud835\udc5cis\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5dt\ud835\udc5ch\ud835\udc60e\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52s\ud835\udc56ta\ud835\udefd1n\ud835\udc61d+ar(d\ud835\udc5ciz\ud835\udc5de\ud835\udc5dd\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc60l\ud835\udc56e\ud835\udc61v\ud835\udc52e\ud835\udc56l\u00d7 o\ud835\udc53f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5are\ud835\udc4ea\ud835\udc59d\ud835\udc52i\ud835\udc56n)g\ud835\udefd 2s\ud835\udc61c+or\ud835\udc53e\ud835\udc52s\ud835\udc5a, \ud835\udc4em\ud835\udc59a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56th\ud835\udefd 3\ud835\udc61sc+o\ud835\udc4bre\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61s\ud835\udefe, +th\ud835\udeffe\ud835\udc61 +se\ud835\udf00lf\ud835\udc56-\ud835\udc61c,ontrol \nscore, or the approaches to learning score of student i in wave t.3 The dummy variable \nfemale indicates the gender of the child, while opposite indicates whether a child has a \ni\nsibling  of  the  opposite  sex. 4  The  other  right-hand-side  variables  are  child \ncharacteristics and wave indicators.5 \nThe effects of interest are the parameter vectors \u03b2  and \u03b2 . Parameters in \u03b2  capture \n1t 2t 1t\na wave-specific intention-to-treat effect of having an opposite sex sibling for boys,  \nwhile the elements of \u03b2  measure the difference in the effects for girls. We use the first \n2t\nwave as baseline category and estimate Equation (1) by weighted least squares using \nsampling  weights  provided  in  the  ECLS-K  data.  Standard  errors  are  clustered  at  \nthe child level. \nThe parameters are identified under the assumption that the sibling sex composition of \nthe two firstborns in families with at least two children is exogenous, conditional on \n6\nother covariates including the total number of siblings in a family.  Arguably, sex at \nbirth is a random outcome and, overall, it is indeed almost evenly distributed, with a \nslightly larger, naturally occurring, chance of having a boy than a girl. For the cohort of \nchildren being considered in this study, the sex-at-birth ratio lies within the standard \nrange for industrialized countries of 1.03 to 1.07 boys for every girl (Citro et al. 2014).  \nHowever, some endogeneity concerns remain. In particular, one key concern is that \nmodern diagnostics allow the early determination of a child's sex before birth, which \ncould lead to sex-selective abortions. However, existing studies provide little evidence \nof significant sex selection in the US that could confound our estimates. Citro et al. \n(2014)  present  difference-in-difference  results  for  Illinois  and  Pennsylvania,  where  \nsex-selective abortions were banned in the 1980s. They find that the reforms had no \neffect on sex ratios. The sex ratios at birth were within the biological norm 5 years \nbefore and after the ban. Overall, Rodgers and Doughty (2001) confirm that the model \nthat best describes the birth data in the US is one that is unconditional on the sex  \nof  previous  siblings.  Finally,  Almond  and  Edlund  (2007) find that  certain  maternal \ncharacteristics are indeed associated with more sons who are young, married, and \nwell-educated. Nevertheless, the resulting difference in sex ratio remains minor for very \nlarge differences in parental characteristics, all within the norm of the sex ratios. \n                                                \n3  All outcome variables are standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. \n4  opposite is defined so that the variable takes into account only siblings \u00b14 years of the sample child. \nThis was chosen so that when the cohort child enters kindergarten the sibling is past baby age where \nhe/she would require a lot of parental attention, but also so that the sibling is not too far away in age \nsuch  that interactions  are  rare.  The  effect  remains significant as  the  age  gap between  siblings \nincreases, but becomes smaller in magnitude. \n5  Covariates are reported in detail in the notes of Table 1. \n6  We emphasize that our identification assumption holds conditional on the total number of children in a \nfamily, because the sex composition of the first-borns may have an impact on family size (cf. Ichino et al. \n2014) and families may face a trade-off in terms of child quantity and quality (cf. Black et al. 2005). Note, \nhowever, that our results remain virtually unchanged if we do not condition on family size or other family \ncharacteristics (see columns 1 and 4 of Table 1). \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 627  Cyron, Schwerdt, and Viarengo \n \n3.

Effects sizes range from an increase of 6% of a standard \ndeviation in math to 12% in approaches to learning.7 Overall, the coefficients of interest \nare very stable to the inclusion of observable covariates\u2014compare columns (1) to (3), \nand  (4)  to  (6)  in  panels  A  and  B\u2014which  is  in  line  with  the  assumption  that  the \ncomposition of sibling sex of the two firstborns in a family is exogenous. \nOver time, however, the effects appear to fade out. The wave interactions in rows 2 \nand 3 of panels A and B show that the initially positive effect reverts to the opposite \ndirection over time, despite not always being significant. By the end of first grade, the \nlinear combinations of opposite and the wave interactions become insignificant for all \noutcomes.8 A potential explanation for this finding may be that the initial effect fades \nout quickly as children integrate into school and other peer groups, such as friends or \nclassmates, gain in importance. \nWe  complement  the  picture  by  showing  that  no  effects  exist  for  girls.  In  fall-\nkindergarten, the coefficients on the interaction terms in the fourth row of panels A and \nB in Table 1 measure this difference in the effect size on girls from having a sibling of \nthe opposite sex. Despite not always being statistically significant, all coefficients are \nnegative and sizable, which indicates that the effects are substantially lower for girls. \nCombined with the baseline effect reported in the first row, the effect on girls of having \na sibling of the opposite sex is not significantly different from zero in all four domains. \nThe estimates of the interaction terms reported in rows 5 and 6 of panels A and B in \nTable 1 show that this result does not change over time. While it is difficult to pin down \na definite explanation for this effect heterogeneity across gender, the finding that girls \nare less likely to be affected by the gender of their peers is in line with other findings in \nthe literature (e.g., Lee et al. 2014). \n4.  CONCLUSION \nThe economic literature on sibling gender effects in education has focused exclusively \non outcomes measured during secondary education and beyond. We contribute to  \nthis literature by providing a first analysis of gender peer effects of siblings on cognitive \nand noncognitive skills at the entry to education. Our identification strategy rests on the \nassumption that the composition of sibling sex of the two firstborns in a family is \narguably exogenous while we also account for total family size. We find that having a \nsister has a positive impact on the initial achievement levels in math, reading, learning \n                                                \n7  Measured by six items: attentiveness, organization, flexibility, persistence in a task, eagerness to learn, \nand independence in learning (Tourangeau et al. 2002). \n8  Additional analyses, available upon request, show that all estimates of sibling effects are insignificant in \nhigher grades, but these estimates are highly imprecise. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 627  Cyron, Schwerdt, and Viarengo \n \nskills, and self-control of boys at kindergarten entry.

Our identification strategy rests on the assumption that, conditional on covariates, the sibling sex composition of the two firstborn children in a family is arguably exogenous. With regard to cognitive skills, learning skills, and self-control measured in kindergarten, we find that boys benefit from having a sister, while there is no effect for girls. We also find evidence for the effect fading out as early as first grade.", "Title": "The Effect of Opposite Sex Siblings on Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills in Early Childhood"}}
