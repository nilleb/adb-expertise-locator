INTRODUCTION \n\nCyron, Schwerdt, and Viarengo \n\nWhile coeducation is the standard practice in schools in the United States (US) since \nthe  19th  century,  academic  interest  is  once  again  renewed  on  the  debated  issue  of \ngender composition in learning environments. Several recent studies have shown more \ngenerally  that  gender  peer  effects  in  schools  affect  educational  outcomes  (Hill  2015; \nHoxby 2000; Lavy and Schlosser 2011).1 Direct evidence on single-sex education also \nlargely  confirms  the  benefits  of  homogeneous  gender  peer  settings  (Eisenkopf  et  al. \n2015;  Jackson  2012;  Lee  et  al.  2014).  Moreover,  several  studies  have  found  that  the \ngender  composition  of  siblings  also  affects  educational  outcomes,  but  the  evidence  \non  gender  peer  effects  of  siblings  is  more  mixed  (Anelli  and  Peri  2015;  Brunello  and  \nDe  Paola  2013;  Butcher  and  Case  1994;  Hauser  and  Kuo  1998;  Parish  and  Willis \n1993).  However,  most  of  the  economic  literature  on  sibling  effects  focuses  on \noutcomes at later stages in life, while gender peer effects of siblings may arguably be \nmost pronounced before children make regular contact with other peer groups. \n\nThis  paper  studies  the  effect  of  opposite  sex  siblings  on  cognitive  and  noncognitive \nskills of children in the US at the onset of formal education. More specifically, we use \ndata  on  skills  of  kindergarten  and  first  grade  students  from  the  Kindergarten  Class  of \n1998\u20131999 of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K). Our empirical strategy \nrests on the assumption that the sex composition of the two firstborns in families with at \nleast  two  children  is  exogenous,  conditional  on  other  covariates  including  the  total \nnumber of siblings in a family. \n\nWe  find  that  boys  with  a  sister  exhibit  significantly  higher  math  and  reading  skills  in \nkindergarten,  and  better  learning skills  and  self-control, than  boys  with  a  brother. The \noverall  effect  on girls  is  insignificant,  which  is  in  line  with  evidence  from other  studies \non  gender  peer  effects  (e.g.,  Lee  et  al.  2014).  We  also  find  some  indication  for  \na  fade-out  of  the  effect  for  boys.  The  effects  on  reading  skills,  learning  skills,  and  \nself-control  at  the  end  of  first  grade  are  significantly  below  the  effects  in  kindergarten \nand  not  significantly  different  from  zero.  This  quick  fade-out  might  be  explained  by  \nthe  gain  in  importance  of  other  peer  groups  during  formal  education  such  as  friends  \nor classmates. \n\n2.  EMPIRICAL STRATEGY \n\nWe  use  data  from  the  ECLS-K,  which  was  administered  by  the  National  Center  for \nEducation  Statistics  (Tourangeau  et  al.  2002).  The  study  is  representative  of  the \nkindergarten population in 1998\u20131999 and follows children from kindergarten to eighth \ngrade. Children are repeatedly given reading and math tests, and assessments of their \nnoncognitive  abilities  are  made.  We  analyze  the  public-use  data  from  the  first  three \nwaves\u2014fall kindergarten, spring kindergarten, and first grade.2 We restrict our sample \nto  the  first  two  children  of  a  family  with  at  least  two  children.  Our  final  estimation \nsample comprises 9,402 children first surveyed in the fall of their kindergarten year. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n1   The evidence on gender peer effects is, however, largely confined to primary and secondary education \n\nand cannot necessarily be extrapolated to higher education (Oosterbeek and van Ewijk 2014).  \n\n2   We focus on the early waves because subsequent attrition leads to a sizable reduction in the sample \n\nsize, and a shift toward children of higher socioeconomic status. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 627 \n \n\nCyron, Schwerdt, and Viarengo \n\nWe estimate the  effect of  having  a  sibling  of  the  opposite  sex  based  on  the following \naugmented educational production function: \n\n \n\n(1) \n\n\u2032\n\ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc61 + (\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56 \u00d7 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56)\n\n\u2032\nwhere  yit  is  the  standardized  level  of  reading  scores,  math  scores,  the  self-control \n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\nscore, or the approaches to learning score of student i in wave t.3 The dummy variable \nfemalei indicates the gender of the child, while opposite indicates whether a child has a \nthe  opposite  sex. 4  The  other  right-hand-side  variables  are  child \nsibling  of \ncharacteristics and wave indicators.5 \n\n\u2032\n\ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\n\n\u2032\n\ud835\udefd3\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n\n\ud835\udefe + \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61,\n\nThe effects of interest are the parameter vectors \u03b21t and \u03b22t. Parameters in \u03b21t capture \na  wave-specific  intention-to-treat  effect  of  having  an  opposite  sex  sibling  for  boys,  \nwhile the elements of \u03b22t measure the difference in the effects for girls. We use the first \nwave as baseline category and estimate Equation (1) by weighted least squares using \nsampling  weights  provided  in  the  ECLS-K  data.  Standard  errors  are  clustered  at  \nthe child level. \n\nThe parameters are identified under the assumption that the sibling sex composition of \nthe  two  firstborns  in  families  with  at  least  two  children  is  exogenous,  conditional  on \nother  covariates  including  the  total  number  of  siblings  in  a  family.6 Arguably,  sex  at \nbirth  is  a  random  outcome  and,  overall,  it  is  indeed  almost  evenly  distributed,  with  a \nslightly larger, naturally occurring, chance of having a boy than a girl. For the cohort of \nchildren  being  considered  in  this  study,  the  sex-at-birth  ratio  lies  within  the  standard \nrange for industrialized countries of 1.03 to 1.07 boys for every girl (Citro et al. 2014).  \n\nHowever,  some  endogeneity  concerns  remain.  In  particular,  one  key  concern  is  that \nmodern  diagnostics  allow  the  early  determination  of  a  child's  sex  before  birth,  which \ncould lead to sex-selective abortions. However, existing studies provide little evidence \nof  significant  sex  selection  in  the  US  that  could  confound  our  estimates.  Citro  et  al. \n(2014)  present  difference-in-difference  results  for  Illinois  and  Pennsylvania,  where  \nsex-selective  abortions  were  banned  in  the  1980s.  They  find  that  the  reforms  had  no \neffect  on  sex  ratios.  The  sex  ratios  at  birth  were  within  the  biological  norm  5  years \nbefore and after the ban. Overall, Rodgers and Doughty (2001) confirm that the model \nthat  best  describes  the  birth  data  in  the  US  is  one  that  is  unconditional  on  the  sex  \nof  previous  siblings.  Finally,  Almond  and  Edlund  (2007)  find  that  certain  maternal \ncharacteristics  are  indeed  associated  with  more  sons  who  are  young,  married,  and \nwell-educated. Nevertheless, the resulting difference in sex ratio remains minor for very \nlarge differences in parental characteristics, all within the norm of the sex ratios. \n\n                                                \n3   All outcome variables are standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. \n4   opposite  is  defined  so  that  the  variable  takes  into  account  only  siblings  \u00b14  years  of  the  sample  child. \nThis was chosen so that when the cohort child enters kindergarten the sibling is past baby age where \nhe/she would require a lot of parental attention, but also so that the sibling is not too far away in age \nsuch  that  interactions  are  rare.  The  effect  remains  significant  as  the  age  gap  between  siblings \nincreases, but becomes smaller in magnitude. \n\n5   Covariates are reported in detail in the notes of Table 1. \n6\n   We emphasize that our identification assumption holds conditional on the total number of children in a \nfamily, because the sex composition of the first-borns may have an impact on family size (cf. Ichino et al. \n2014) and families may face a trade-off in terms of child quantity and quality (cf. Black et al. 2005). Note, \nhowever, that our results remain virtually unchanged if we do not condition on family size or other family \ncharacteristics (see columns 1 and 4 of Table 1). \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 627 \n \n\n3.

Effects  sizes  range  from  an  increase  of  6%  of  a  standard \ndeviation in math to 12% in approaches to learning.7 Overall, the coefficients of interest \nare very stable to the inclusion of observable covariates\u2014compare columns (1) to (3), \nand  (4)  to  (6)  in  panels  A  and  B\u2014which  is  in  line  with  the  assumption  that  the \ncomposition of sibling sex of the two firstborns in a family is exogenous. \n\nOver  time,  however,  the  effects  appear  to  fade  out.  The  wave  interactions  in  rows  2 \nand  3  of  panels  A  and  B  show  that  the  initially  positive  effect  reverts  to  the  opposite \ndirection over time, despite not always being significant. By the end of first grade, the \nlinear  combinations  of  opposite  and  the  wave  interactions  become  insignificant  for  all \noutcomes.8 A  potential  explanation  for  this  finding  may  be  that  the  initial  effect  fades \nout quickly as children integrate into school and other peer groups, such as friends or \nclassmates, gain in importance. \n\nWe  complement  the  picture  by  showing  that  no  effects  exist  for  girls.  In  fall-\nkindergarten, the coefficients on the interaction terms in the fourth row of panels A and \nB in Table 1 measure this difference in the effect size on girls from having a sibling of \nthe  opposite  sex.  Despite  not  always  being  statistically  significant,  all  coefficients  are \nnegative  and  sizable,  which  indicates  that  the  effects  are  substantially  lower  for  girls. \nCombined with the baseline effect reported in the first row, the effect on girls of having \na sibling of the opposite sex is not significantly different from zero in all four domains. \nThe  estimates  of the  interaction  terms  reported  in  rows  5  and  6  of  panels  A  and  B  in \nTable 1 show that this result does not change over time. While it is difficult to pin down \na definite explanation for this effect heterogeneity across gender, the finding that girls \nare less likely to be affected by the gender of their peers is in line with other findings in \nthe literature (e.g., Lee et al. 2014). \n\n4.  CONCLUSION \n\nThe economic literature on sibling gender effects in education has focused exclusively \non  outcomes  measured  during  secondary  education  and  beyond.  We  contribute  to  \nthis literature by providing a first analysis of gender peer effects of siblings on cognitive \nand noncognitive skills at the entry to education. Our identification strategy rests on the \nassumption  that  the  composition  of  sibling  sex  of  the  two  firstborns  in  a  family  is \narguably exogenous while we also account for total family size. We find that having a \nsister has a positive impact on the initial achievement levels in math, reading, learning \n\n                                                \n7   Measured by six items: attentiveness, organization, flexibility, persistence in a task, eagerness to learn, \n\nand independence in learning (Tourangeau et al. 2002). \n\n8   Additional analyses, available upon request, show that all estimates of sibling effects are insignificant in \n\nhigher grades, but these estimates are highly imprecise. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 627 \n \n\nCyron, Schwerdt, and Viarengo \n\nskills, and self-control of boys at kindergarten entry. In contrast, educational outcomes \nof  girls  are  not  affected  by  the  gender  of  their  siblings.  Furthermore,  while  having  a \nsister  is  beneficial  for  the  school  readiness  of  boys,  the  effect  fades  out  quickly  and \ndisappears  by  the  end  of  first  grade.  We  hypothesize  that  this  fade-out  might  be \nexplained  by  classmates  and  friends  quickly  replacing  siblings  as  the  dominant  peer \ngroup after school entry. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 627 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nCyron, Schwerdt, and Viarengo \n\nAlmond, D., and L.
