For a variety of historical reasons the three provinces of North East China, \nHeilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, also known collectively as Inner Manchuria or Dongbei pose \nquite  different  challenges  for  regional  policy  as  compared  with  the  backward  Western \nprovinces.  \n\nThe  North  East  is  the  old  heavy  industry  centre  of  the  country  and  as  such  retains  a \nstrong SOE presence. In the post war period initially with Soviet aid it became the part of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (henceforth PRC) that most closely resembled the Soviet Union \nin industrial organization and production structure with a focus on heavy industry and mineral \nexploitation. Its share of national industrial output in 1940 was as much as one third. This fell \nto 17% in 1978 at the beginning of the reforms to less than 10% in 2004.  \n\nHistorically  the  region  has  not  been  poor  by  national  standards.  In  terms  of  GDP  per \ncapita  Heilongjiang  and  Liaoning  were  among  the  richest  provinces  in  1978.  This  position \nhas been eroded over time with the fast growth in the coastal provinces, but in 2004 GDP per \ncapita  was  about  a  third  above  the  national  average  and  twice  the  figure  in  the  poorer \nWestern  provinces.  The  disparity  within  the  north-east  can  be  seen  from  the  fact  that  the \nprovince  of Liaoning  has  a  per  capita  income more  than  50%  above  Jilin  and  roughly  20% \nabove Heilonjiang.  \n\nHowever, the SOE sector in the region has been a cause of considerable concern and its \nrestructuring  poses  considerable  challenges.  The  close  links  between  banks  in  the  region \nand  SOEs  has  meant  that  loans  have  been  channelled  to  these  enterprises  to  cover \noperating losses and consequently in 2003 the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio in the region \nwas nearly 50% higher than the national average in Heilongjiang and nearly 20% higher in \nJilin;  it  was  close  to  the  average  in  Liaoning.  This  bank-SOE  relationship  has  hindered  the \nemergence of an effective system of financial intermediation in the region.  \n\nAlthough  the  problems  facing  the  north-east  are  well  known  the  region  also  has  a \nnumber  of  potential  advantages  that  can  be  built  on.  First,  the  transport  infrastructure  is \nbased on trade flows established in the Japanese colonial period, and also the earlier treaty \nperiods dominated by both Japan and Russia. However the economic future of the region will \nbe  determined  to  a  large  extent  by  its  ability  to  redevelop  its  links  to  Japan,  Korea  and \nRussia and with ongoing improvements in infrastructure there are good possibilities for closer \nties. \n\nSecond, while the large SOE sector remains a key problem to be addressed the heavy \nindustrial investment of the past has led to the creation of a skilled technical work force. The \neducation  system  initially  established  by  the  Japanese  to  support  its  colonial  industrial \ndevelopment  continues  to  have  world-class  research  and  teaching.  Education  standards, \nespecially in the urban areas, are among the highest in PRC. Illiteracy rates are the lowest \nnationally other than for Beijing, and the university enrolment rate is well above the national \naverage. Also while it is common to point out the heavy burden that SOEs carry in the form \nof  schools,  hospitals  and  other  social  services,  the  other  side  of  this  coin  is  that  life \nexpectancy  in  the  north-east  is  among  the  highest  in  the  country,  with  access  to  health \nfacilities also among the highest nationally.  \n\nThird, although the borders of Inner Manchuria are still not fully open, they are partially \nopen.  The  amount  of  trade  that  is  taking  place  is  increasing.  As  relations  between  Russia \nand  PRC  improve,  and  as  the  international  status  of  the  Democratic  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nKorea (DPRK) is normalised, the scope for cross-border economic development will increase. \nIn  2002  \u2018regional  trade\u2019  defined  as  trade  with  the  neighboring  countries  of  Russia,  Japan, \nRepublic  of  Korea  and  DPRK  was  over  half  of  total  exports  from  Liaoning  and  Jilin  and \nroughly two-thirds for Heilongjiang and there is scope for further expansion.  \n\nFourth, unemployment is above the national average and this has kept wages relatively \nlow. Heilongjiang and Liaoning have unemployment rates higher than the national average, \n\n\fwhilst that in Jilin is roughly the same as the average rate. This lower  rate reflects the fact \nthat  Jilin  still  has  a  higher  share  of  its  population  in  primary  sector  occupations  (mainly \nagriculture)  than  most  other  provinces\u2014at  nearly  20%  it  is  roughly  double  the  rates  in \nHeilongjiang  and  Liaoning.  The  unemployment  in  Heilongjiang  and  Liaoning  keeps  wages \nrates lower than in most of the country and rates are lower in Jilin too, as surplus labor in the \ncountryside acts as a brake on urban wages.  \n\nFifth,  and  finally,  whilst  there  are  problems  of  resource  depletion  and  environmental \npollution  all  three  provinces  claim  to  have  large  untapped  reserves  of  a  wide  range  of \nminerals. In addition unlike other parts of the country there is no shortage of water and there \nare extensive areas of relatively underdeveloped land, even of prime quality agricultural land.  \nIt is a mistake to think that in policy terms the north-east has been stagnant at a time of \ngreat economic change in the rest of the country. There has been a rapid expansion in the \nprivatization  program  for  the  SOE  sector,  which  broadly  follows  the  national  trend.  Foreign \ndirect  investment  often  seen  as  the  driving  force  for  economic  change  in  PRC  has  been \ncoming  to  the  north-east,  although  new  investments  are  principally  to  Liaoning  (especially \nDalian  and  its  hinterland)  and  Jilin  rather  than  to  Heilongjiang.  Aggregated  over  the  three \nprovinces the share of foreign firms in industrial output is currently slightly above the national \naverage  (although  well  below  the  coastal  areas).  Through  a  Special  Economic  Zone  policy \nand other incentives attempts are being made to induce foreign investors to invest in a range \nof  activities  to  help  diversify  the  region  away  from  old  heavy  industry  and  engineering \nactivities. New initiatives include investments in agro-processing, mineral development and a \nrange of higher technology activities.  \n\nHowever  success  in  any  new  area  requires  overcoming  the  \u2018locational  disadvantage\u2019 \nsuffered  by  three  provinces  that  enterprise-level  analysis  conducted  by  the  ADB  Institute \nseeks to quantify (see below). \n\nWhat explains regional growth in PRC? \nSince the early 1990\u2019s with the \u2018Opening Up\u2019 of trade and foreign investment there has been \nclear  divergence  in  incomes  between  provinces  due  principally  to  the  rapid  growth  of  the \ncoastal provinces in the eastern region. Two key factors have been put forward to explain the \nrapid  growth  of  the  coastal  provinces.  One  is  the  policy  environment,  based  around  the \nSpecial Economic Zones and other related incentives for FDI, and the other is the favoured \ngeography  of  the  coastal  provinces  with  easy  access  to  the  coast  and  thus  international \ntrading  networks.  The  north-east  is  not  particularly  disadvantaged  by  either  criteria  and  in \none well-known index of policy (based on number of zones) relative to the other regions the \nnorth-east has the highest score after the coastal region. \n\nOwnership  of  enterprises  in  a  province  also  appears  to  have  had  an  important  growth \neffect. The share of \u2018foreign invested enterprises\u2019 in economic activity in a province appears \nto  have  had  a  positive  growth  effect  either  directly  through  its  impact  on  efficiency  or \nindirectly  through  externalities.  Conversely  the  share  of  state  owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  in \nprovincial activity appears to exert a negative effect, either due to their own inefficiencies, or \nto  the  requirement  in  the  past  for  banks  to  channel  funds  to  SOEs  at  the  expense  of  new \nforms of non-state enterprise.  \n\nto  be \n\nthe  quality  of  provincial \n\nAn  important  aspect  of  the  investment  climate  that  impacts  on  provincial  growth  has \nbeen  shown \ninfrastructure,  particularly  roads  and \ntelecommunications. Infrastructure activities link provinces with the external sector and are a \nmeans  of  overcoming  geographic  barriers  like  distance  to  a  port.  In  addition  they  link \nprovinces  with  each  other  and  thus  stimulate  inter-province  trade.  Good  infrastructure  can \nalso  be  an  incentive  to  higher  investment.  The  north-east  region  is  not  particularly  poorly \nendowed  with  infrastructure  by  national  standards  with  the  exception  of  village  roads  in \nHeilongjiang, where only roughly half of villages have good highway connections.  \n\n\fIn  general,  what  matters  for  regional  growth  are  policy  on  openness  to  investment  and \ntrade, ownership (the respective shares of state and foreign-owned firms in economic activity) \nand by implication competition, infrastructure and geography.  \n\nEnterprise data \nThe ADB Institute has examined in detail firm-level data on large and medium scale industrial \nenterprises  across  all  provinces  to  establish  how  far  performance  varies  by  province  after \nallowing for all other measurable factors. Data come from on annual survey of the National \nBureau of Statistics, Beijing. The period covered is 1995\u20132002. The sample is large and in \n2002 the enterprises covered accounted for over 40% of the national industrial value-added.  \nIn general the picture is mixed with an overall improvement in recorded profitability over \nthe period, but with two of the three north-east provinces (Jilin and Liaoning) having a higher \nproportion of total assets in loss-making enterprises in 2002 than the national average. Jilin \nand  Heilonjiang,  in  particular,  have  a  higher  proportion  of  enterprises  in  the  profitable \ncategory than the national average, although in the latter case this is influenced strongly by \nthe petroleum sector.  \n\nFor  the  whole  sample  the  north-east  started  the  mid-1990s  with  a  higher  employment \nshare  in  the  SOE  sector.  There  have  been  significant  employment  shifts  due  to  SOE \nrestructuring and privatizations both nationally and in the region, but at the end of the period \nSOEs  still  retained  roughly  two-thirds  of  employment  in  medium  and  large-scale  enterprise \nemployment  in  Jilin  and  Heilongjiang.  The  proportion  in  Liaoning  is  closer  to  the  national \naverage.  \n\nOver  the  period  1995\u20132002  for  the  sample  we  can  measure  privatization  by  the \npercentage point change in the share of SOEs in both employment and fixed assets. In the \ndecline  in  SOE  employment  share  almost  matched  the  national  trend.  Jilin  and  Heilonjiang \nwere behind the national trend. However by the criteria of the fall of SOEs in total assets of \nthe  medium  and  large-scale  sector,  privatization  in  the  region  has  in  each  province  either \nexceeded or matched the national trend. \n\nDespite  these  changes  there  is  a  widespread  perception  that  the  north-east  remains  a \nproblem region. To illustrate this we use two simple performance indicators value-added per \nemployee, as a measure of productivity, and \u2018imputed profits\u2019 to total assets, as a measure of \nreturns  on  investment.  Imputed  profits  are  calculated  as  value  added  minus  the  sum  of \nwages,  financial  charges  and  depreciation.  Indicators  such  as  these  must  be  related  to \nparticular industrial sectors and a direct comparison of these two measures for the north-east \nand the rest of the country by 2-digit industry category shows that in only three sectors (Food \nproduction, Petroleum processing and Non-Metal mining) does the north-east have a higher \naverage  labor  productivity.  Similarly  it  has  a  higher  average  profitability  again  in  only  3 \nsectors  (now  Petroleum  extraction,  Petroleum  processing  and  Furniture).  In  all  other  cases \nperformance  of  firms  in  the  north-east  is  below  that  in  the  rest  of  the  country,  indicating  a \nclear \u2018performance gap\u2019. \n\nA  key  issue  is  how  far  is  this  gap  due  to  factors  like  differences  in  scale,  technology, \nownership,  and  competition  across  regions,  and  how  far  is  it  due  to  the  operating \nenvironment or \u2018investment climate\u2019, which creates a \u2018location disadvantage\u2019 in the north-east. \nThis  issue  is  addressed  by  a  panel  data  regression  model  using  enterprise  data  for  over \n44,000  firms  over  1995\u20132002.  The  analysis  attempts  to  isolate  the  different  effects  on \nperformance,  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  enterprise  itself,  the  characteristics  of  the \nsector in which it operates, time factors and a series of dummy variables including province \nspecific and regional dummies.  \n\nHere  we  highlight  a  few  key  results.  First,  in  terms  of  explaining  both  enterprise \nproductivity  and  profitability  a  single  dummy  for  the  three  north-east  provinces  is  both \nsignificant  and  negative.  If  all  the  other  control  variables  have  the  same  value,  enterprises \nlocated in the north-east are likely to have lower value-added per worker by as much as 44 \npercentage points. For profitability controlling for all other factors the profit to assets ratio in \n\n\fthe north-east is 4 percentage points below that of comparable enterprises in other locations \nin the country. \n\nSecond,  if  we  decompose  the  north-east  by  using  three  single  dummies  for  each \nprovince the provinces perform similarly and have almost the same performance gap with the \nrest of PRC. Lioaning has the largest gap. Its profitability is 4.7 percentage points lower than \nthe  rest  of  the  country,  compared  with  3.3  percentage  points  for  Jilin  and  Heilonjiang.  In \ngeneral  however  there  are  no  significant  \u2018within  north-east\u2019  effects  with  all  three  provinces \nsharing broadly similar locational disadvantages. \n\nThird,  when  we  use  individual  dummies  for  each  province  in  the  country  we  obtain  a \nranking  relative  to  the  province  where  profitability  is  highest  Shandong.  The  negative \ncoefficients for the three north-east provinces show that their productivity and profitability is \nalways  below  Shandong,  after  controlling  for  various  ownership,  scale,  sector,  technology \nand other relevant factors. By profitability Liaoning is 8.1 percentage points below, whilst Jilin \nand Heilongjiang are roughly 6.9 percentage points below. In terms of national ranking out of \nall provinces the three north-east provinces have three out of the bottom four places in value \nadded per worker. By profitability the ranking out of 28 provinces is 21 for Heilongjiang, 22 \nfor  Jilin,  and  27  for  Liaoning.  These  rankings  take  account  of  characteristics  of  enterprises \nand the structure of production in the different provinces.  \n\nThese results imply that even if these provinces brought their situation up to the national \nlevel  in  terms  of  ownership,  industry  structure and  competition,  firms  there  would still  show \nsubstantially lower profitability due to provincial location disadvantages.  \n\nConclusions \nThe  north-east  provinces  are  not  particularly  disadvantaged  geographically  by  national \nstandards  (for  example  using  share  of  the  population  within  100  kms  of  the  coast  as  the \nindicator). Similarly the provinces of the north-east have had a policy of introducing Special \nEconomic  Zones  for  a  number  of  years.  Infrastructure  provision  and  quality  is  no  doubt \nimportant,  but  again  the  north-east  is  not  particularly  disadvantaged  (for  example  by  road \nlength per sq km of land area).  \n\nThis  leaves  the  key  explanation  likely  to  lie  with  the  \u2018investment  climate\u2019  in  the  region. \nLack of \u2018marketization\u2019, defined as the limited spread of market relations in the north-east, is \na widely cited explanation for its relatively poor performance and prospects. Our analysis of \nenterprises  controls  for  these  structural  features  and  shows  that  there  are  other  factors  at \nwork.  Even  allowing  for  a  lower  than  average  role  for  non-state  or  foreign-owned  firms  in \ndifferent sectors, and also for an industrial structure in which traditional heavy industry has a \nrelative high weight, performance is still poor.  \n\nThis leaves as the key explanation more fundamental features of the investment climate \nrelating  to  institutional  quality  via  the  enforcement  of  property  rights,  the  application  of \nregulations  and  the  intervention  by  government  in  the  operation  of  enterprises  and  the \ndevelopment  of  financial  norms  and  institutions.  Reform  in  these  areas  will  be  complex, \nhowever  the  results  leave  little  doubt  that  changes  in  ownership  (for  example  with  more \nprivate and less state ownership) and industrial structure (for example towards more dynamic \ntechnologically sophisticated activities) that are often put forward as solutions for the region\u2019s \nproblems  are  unlikely  to  be  sufficient  to  raise  its  performance  to  national  levels  for \ncomparable activities. \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Introduction \nSince  the  government  announced  the  Revitalise  the  North  East  policy  in  2002  there  has \nbeen a new focus to regional policy following on from the previous, but continuing, Develop \nthe West policy.
