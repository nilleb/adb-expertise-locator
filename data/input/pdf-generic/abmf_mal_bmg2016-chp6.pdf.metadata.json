Some \nexemptions apply. The distinction of the GST in Malaysia is, however, that not all fees and \ncharges are shown to include the GST when displayed in price lists or on websites. Therefore, \nthe final cost to the client or investor may be higher than indicated. \nNonresidents do not pay GST; hence, invoices to foreign issuers and investors for service \nprovisions by domestic bond market institutions do not include GST on such services.\n6.  Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements\nDouble taxation avoidance agreements (DTAAs) are bilateral tax treaties signed by Malaysia \nwith other countries that specify the taxing right of each contracting state, while ensuring \nthe income will only be taxed at one jurisdiction. The scope of Malaysian DTAAs is limited to \ndirect taxes and only covers persons who are residents of the contracting states.\nMalaysia has an extensive network of DTAAs, with 75 DTAAs signed and a few others in the \npipeline.\n7.  Tax Exemption for Nonresident Investors \nTax exemptions for nonresident investors are not applicable, since Malaysia does not apply \ncapital gains and withholding taxes on the income or considerations from debt securities and \nsukuk, respectively. \nThis is notwithstanding specific provisions for preferential tax treatment in prevailing DTAAs. \nIf in doubt, investors are encouraged to seek the advice of professional tax advisors with \nregard to their own specific tax situation.
