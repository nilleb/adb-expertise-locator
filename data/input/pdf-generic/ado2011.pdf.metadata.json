The Asian Development Outlook 2011 shows \nthat the region\u2019s recovery from the recent global economic downturn is \nfirming with growth expected to reach nearly 8% in 2011 and 2012. This \ncontinued high growth follows the 9% expansion from the trough of the \ncrisis.\n\nThe consolidation of the global recovery is, however, uneven. While \n\ndeveloping Asia\u2014and the economies of \u201cthe South\u201d in general\u2014have \nrecouped the ground lost during the global downturn, the major \nindustrial countries are progressing modestly. After the 2.6% rebound last \nyear, the three economies of the United States, eurozone, and Japan are \ncollectively expected to expand by 2.1% in 2011 and 2012. \n\nAlthough the risk of these economies falling back into recession is \nreceding, even this modest industrial-country recovery is fraught with \nrisks. Tensions in the Middle East are pushing up oil prices. Japan is \ncoping with the tragedy of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Labor \nand housing market weaknesses are holding back recovery in the United \nStates. The eurozone has not fully resolved the sovereign debt problems in \nits periphery. \n\nThe Asian Development Outlook 2011 emphasizes two important \nchallenges that developing Asia must resolve to sustain the inclusive \ngrowth that is needed to eliminate poverty in the region. The immediate \nproblem is tackling rising consumer price pressures. Inflation\u2019s insidious \neffects call for preemptive action to contain it before it begins to \naccelerate. The poor are the most vulnerable, particularly from rising food \nprices. \n\nManaging inflation is not easy. Because of the faster recovery, \n\ndemand pressures are more intense in the region than among the major \nindustrial economies. The recent surges in global oil and food prices are \nadding further pressures. Even though steps have been taken to reduce \nprice pressures, inflation in the region is expected to pick up to 5.3% \nthis year. Many countries may already be behind the curve in fighting \ninflation, and some countries are showing signs of overheating. The task \nis complicated because lifting interest rates may induce foreign capital \ninflows, which can add to price pressures. \n\nGetting the policy response right depends on the problem. Where \ncurrent account surpluses persist and exchange rates are misaligned with \nfundamentals, more flexible exchange rates may be the best option. For \nother economies, monetary tightening may be coupled with temporary \ncapital controls, which should be coordinated internationally.\n\nThe second challenge is fostering new sources to sustain the region\u2019s \n\ngrowth into the future. In this regard, the trend of growing trade and \ninvestment with other developing countries\u2014so-called South\u2013South \nlinks\u2014is encouraging. The share of world merchandise trade among \n\n\fcountries in the South has more than doubled in less than two decades, \nfrom 7% in 1990 to 17% in 2009. \n\nMuch of the rise in trade and investment between economies in the \n\nSouth can be accounted for by the rise of \u201cfactory Asia\u201d\u2014where parts \nand components move across borders in the region but the assembled \nfinal goods are exported to major industrial-country markets. Thus while \ndeveloping Asia is at the forefront of the South\u2019s emerging economic \ninfluence, current production arrangements are still, ultimately, highly \ndependent on the North.\n\nAt a time of modest growth in industrial countries, improved \nSouth\u2013South relations can be a potential new driver for global growth. \nFortunately, there is considerable scope to deepen economic links \nwithin the South, but these will not come automatically. To fully tap the \npotential of these markets as new sources of growth, policy makers must \nremove impediments to South\u2013South trade and investment, which are \nstill higher than those with the North; and much work needs to be done \nto reduce barriers within the South to promote global integration.\n\nAs South\u2013South ties evolve, developing Asia can draw on insights \n\nstemming from its success in its own regional cooperation and \nintegration\u2014both for itself and for other regions of the world. These ties \nare supported by the Asian Development Bank as an effective approach to \neliminate poverty.\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThe Asian Development Outlook 2011 was prepared by the staff of the \nAsian Development Bank from the Central and West Asia Department, \nEast Asia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, \nSoutheast Asia Department, Economics and Research Department, as well \nas the resident missions.

The  region  is \nforecast  to  grow  by  7.8%  in  2011  and  7.7%  in  2012. \n\nIt  faces  two  critical  challenges  to  maintain  inclusive  growth  in \nthe  years  ahead.  The  most  immediate  is  responding  to  swelling \ninflation  pressures,  which  can  be  complicated  by  subsequent \ncapital  inflows.  Policy  makers  will  need  to  maintain  a  coherent \npolicy  mix  to  ensure  success  here. \n\nFurther  ahead,  the  region  must  explore  and  then  foster  new \nsources  of  growth.  The  strengthening  of  ties  with  developing \ncountries,  both  in  the  region  and  beyond,  has  much  potential, \nbut  so  far  these  links  have  been  mainly  used  for  final  goods \nexports  to  major  industrial  countries. \n\nTo  fully  tap  the  potential  of  these  developing-country  markets \nas  new  sources  of  growth,  policy  makers  must  remove  barriers \nto  \u201cSouth\u2013South\u201d  trade  and  investment,  which  are  still  higher \nthan  those  with  the  industrial  world.\n\n\fx    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nKey messages\n\u2022\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s recovery is firming. Its high growth is expected to continue \ndespite the modest recovery in the major industrial economies. The region is \nforecast to grow by 7.8% in 2011 and 7.7% in 2012. In order to maintain sustainable \nand inclusive growth, however, Asia must confront two important challenges.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFirst, on the immediate horizon, is coping with rising inflation pressures. \nDeveloping Asia\u2019s swift turnaround from the crisis provided the impetus for rising \nconsumer prices. Tensions in the Middle East and the nuclear anxieties in Japan \nhave further lifted market expectations of higher oil prices. Consumer price \ninflation in the region is forecast to rise to 5.3% in 2011, and some economies are \nshowing signs of potential overheating.\n\nAlthough inflation is generally still low, regional policy makers need to make \npreemptive management of inflation a top priority. Developing Asia is home \nto two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor, and it is they who are the most vulnerable to \nits effects. Maintaining a coherent policy mix is key to success since monetary \ntightening to curb inflation pressures is likely to invite an increase in foreign capital \ninflows, which would compound the problems of managing inflation.\n\nMore flexible exchange rates may be a better policy for countries with persistent \ncurrent account imbalances and misalignment between their exchange rate and \nfundamentals. For countries without such symptoms, relying more on temporary \npolicies, such as capital controls, may be an option if they are carried out in an \ninternationally coordinated manner.\n\nThe second challenge is to find and contribute to new sources of sustainable \nglobal growth. Industrial countries are unlikely to drive global growth any time \nsoon and the economies of the South\u2014developing Asia, Africa, Latin America, and \nthe Middle East\u2014should take up the slack.\n\nIt is encouraging that South\u2013South economic links are strengthening and \ncontributing to the recovery of the world\u2019s economy. South\u2013South trade has \nexpanded fast in the past two decades, from about 7% of nonfuel world merchandise \ntrade in 1990 to 17% in 2009. Foreign direct investment (FDI) links have also increased \nhugely as high-saving Southern economies have become new sources of outward FDI.\n\nThis strengthening does not, however, guarantee sustainable growth for Asia. \nMuch of it was the result of the rise of \u201cfactory Asia,\u201d where developing Asia sourced \nintermediate goods and parts from within Asia to assemble them into final goods to \nbe exported to affluent markets in the North. Hence growing South\u2013South links do \nnot necessarily translate into greater economic independence from the North.\n\nStrengthening South\u2013South links through recycling savings to finance investment \n(rather than holding them in safe assets) could enhance the growth potential of \nthe South and contribute to the stability of the global economy by promoting \nglobal rebalancing. To do that, the South has to work hard to reduce internal trade \nand investment barriers\u2014still higher than those with the North\u2014and continue to \npromote global and regional integration.\n\n\fHighlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xi\n\nMuted Industrial-country Upswing\n\u2022\n\nRecovery is progressing modestly in the major industrial economies.\nthe gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States, eurozone, and Japan \ntogether expanded by a respectable 2.6% (partly due to the effect of the lower \nbase from the downturn). Yet it is still unclear whether private demand can \nsustain growth once authorities start to normalize fiscal and monetary policies. \nConsequently, their GDP is forecast to expand at a somewhat slower pace than \nthe initial rebound: 2.1% in both 2011 and 2012. Despite rising global commodity \nprices and accommodative monetary policy, industrial-country inflation remains \nlow due to their slower growth prospects.\n\n In 2010, \n\n\u2022\n\nGlobal uncertainties pose risks to maintaining their growth momentum, \nhowever.\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\nThe recent surge in oil prices could undermine the global recovery, and \ngeopolitical and other factors have heightened uncertainty about future \nprices. Political instability in the Middle East raises questions about oil \nsupplies, while Japan\u2019s nuclear energy woes have heightened concerns about \nthis alternative energy source. Food prices hit records in February 2011. While \ncore inflation remains low in industrial countries, oil and food price pressures \ncan fuel inflation in developing countries where recovery is well under way.\n\nDespite the mild recovery that is forecast (2.8% in 2011 and 2.6% in 2012), the \nUnited States economy is beset by stubbornly high unemployment and weak \nhousing markets. These undermine the strength of the economy, and thus the \nglobal outlook.\n\nSovereign debt problems in the eurozone periphery still await a fundamental \nresolution, which could jeopardize the 1.6% growth forecast for both 2011 \nand 2012. Further problems may precipitate financial instability within \nthe eurozone\u2014which could even spread globally. Inflation and global \ngeopolitical uncertainty can increase borrowing costs, further aggravating the \nfiscal problems in the single-currency bloc.\n\nJapan\u2019s economy is slowing after its rebound from the recession, and it must \nnow face the challenges arising from one of the most destructive natural \ndisasters in its history. The short-run economic impacts from the supply \ndisruptions and power shortages could be substantial, but the long-run \nprognosis is less dire. Through reconstruction efforts and the return of \nproductive activity, the economy is forecast to grow by 1.5% in 2011 and 1.8% \nin 2012.\n\n\fxii    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s Outlook\n\u2022\n\n The region is projected to grow \n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s recovery is firming.\nby 7.8% in 2011 and 7.7% in 2012. The moderation from 9.0% in 2010 stems \nfrom slower growth of the major industrial economies and world trade \nas well as normalization of fiscal and monetary policy. The exceptional \nperformance of 2010 was partly due to the base effect, as the region \nbounced back from the impact of the global downturn. The moderation \nmarks a welcome return to growth rates that can be sustained without \nstoking inflation.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s robust growth provided timely support during \nthe crisis and recovery. The region\u2019s resilience has contributed to \nthe recovery of both industrial economies and non-Asian developing \ncountries, primarily via the trade channel. Even as global trade collapsed, \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s imports continued to grow. Rapid growth in the region\u2019s \ntwo giants\u2014the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India\u2014will continue \nto lift regional and global growth. The medium-term outlook for both is \ngood, although finance sector risks in the PRC and the fiscal consolidation \nin India need to be addressed.\n\nThe current account surplus is falling and projected to decline further.\nRising commodity prices, especially for oil, and the region\u2019s strong GDP \ngrowth are raising its imports. The current account surplus fell from 4.7% \nof GDP in 2009 to 4.1% in 2010. Under the forecasts for even higher oil \nprices with continued strong growth, the region\u2019s current account balance \nis forecast to fall further to 3.3% of GDP in 2011 and 3.0% in 2012. Yet \nthis should not be interpreted as an unwinding of the structural global \nimbalances.\n\nInflation pressures are building, and preemptive measures may well \nbe needed to avoid overheating. Inflation has risen more sharply in \nthe region than in the major industrial countries. Consumer prices rose \nby 4.4% in 2010, accelerating from 1.2% in 2009, on a combination of \nexternal factors (global oil and food price shocks) and the robust domestic \nrecovery. Although many central banks have already taken action, inflation \nis expected to accelerate further to 5.3% in 2011 before tapering off to 4.6% \nin 2012.\n\nRising oil and food prices could shake developing Asia\u2019s \nmacroeconomic stability. Model simulations show that a 30% increase in \nboth oil and food prices over their 2010 levels could shave 0.7 percentage \npoints from the region\u2019s forecast growth and add 1.7 percentage \npoints to its inflation rate. An oil price shock has the bigger impact on \nmacroeconomic stability, but rising food prices disproportionately affect \nthe poor.\n\n\fHighlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xiii\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe need to take preemptive action on inflation is building in \ndeveloping Asia.\n\nDemand pressure in some Asian economies is more intense than in the \nadvanced countries. Growing demand pressures can put strains on the \nlabor market, potentially inducing a wage\u2013inflation spiral.\n\nInflation undermines the promotion of inclusive growth through its \neffects on poverty and inequality. Its impact, particularly if driven by food \nprices, increases the number of poor since the region\u2019s consumption \nbaskets tend to have larger shares of food than those in the advanced \neconomies. This widens income inequality and could potentially lead to \nsocial tensions.\n\nAuthorities have started responding to inflation, but some may be behind \nthe curve. So far, Asian economies have either allowed their currencies \nto appreciate or have imposed tariff-relief measures to curb imported \ninflation (with varying results). They have also tightened monetary policy \nto manage the growing demand pressures, but some countries are still \nshowing signs of overheating.\n\nManaging inflation pressure is not easy. \ncoherent.\n\nThe policy mix needs to be \n\nIncreasing benchmark policy rates would prompt wider interest \ndifferentials, and so attract more volatile capital inflows.\n\nLetting currencies appreciate more flexibly is one option, but may not be \nappealing for those who favor maintaining international competitiveness. \nIntervening in the foreign exchange markets is not an alternative, \nhowever. The intervention may not be globally acceptable and could be \nself-defeating as it potentially worsens domestic inflation pressures.\n\nImposing selective and carefully designed temporary capital control \nmeasures on inflows might be another option. To be effective, however, \nsuch measures require high degrees of administrative capacity to \nimplement and should only be exercised temporarily.\n\nAppropriate policies to deal with inflation and capital inflows depend on \nthe specific problem. More flexible exchange rates may be a better policy \nfor countries with persistent current account imbalances and misalignment \nbetween the exchange rate and fundamentals. For countries without such \nsymptoms, relying more on temporary policies, such as capital controls, \ncan be an option if executed in an internationally coordinated manner. \nG20\u2019s recent efforts to establish practical indicative guidelines for assessing \ncountries\u2019 current account imbalances and principles for capital controls \ncould provide useful tools.\n\n\fxiv    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nOutlook by Subregion\n\u2022\n\nLed by the PRC, \n\nEast Asia will grow most rapidly in developing Asia. \naggregate subregional GDP growth will moderate somewhat from its 9.6% \nrecovery pace in 2010 to 8.4% in 2011 and 8.1% in 2012. Slower investment \n(from the winding down of policy stimulus) and less-heated export growth \nwill temper GDP expansion in the PRC\u2014from the 10.3% recovery to 9.6% \nin 2011 and 9.2% in 2012. Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and \nTaipei,China will settle back to more sustainable growth of around 5% after \ntheir sharp 2010 rebound. Most East Asian economies are moving toward a \ntighter monetary stance as their production levels reach their potential and \nrising commodity prices add pressure. Inflation in the subregion is forecast to \npick up in 2011 to 4.3% (from 3.1% in 2010) before easing back to 3.9% in 2012.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s expansion will moderate after its exceptionally strong \nrecovery. Growth is expected to step down in light of the higher 2010 \nbase (from 7.8% growth that year), a slowing in export growth, and policy \ntightening by governments. GDP will expand by 5.5% in 2011 and 5.7% in \n2012. This moderation is most notable in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nand Thailand, which grew rapidly during the recovery. The region is also \nplaying its part in rebalancing growth toward private domestic demand, as \nseen in the increased investment rate in Indonesia. Inflation in Southeast \nAsia is accelerating from its moderate rate of 4.0% in 2010 to 5.1% in 2011. \nInflation pressures have been more tenacious in some countries\u2014Viet \nNam, for example, is expected to hit double digits. With appropriate policy \nresponses, Southeast Asia\u2019s average inflation is expected to come down to \n4.2% in 2012.\n\n After growing by 7.9% in 2010 \nSouth Asia\u2019s GDP is expanding steadily.\nin line with the global recovery, growth will continue steadily, at 7.5% in \n2011 and 8.1% in 2012. Leading the subregion, India\u2019s 2010 expansion was \nrobust and broad-based (8.6%)\u2014even in the face of fiscal consolidation and \nsubstantial monetary tightening\u2014and is set to remain strong at 8.2% in \n2011 and 8.8% in 2012. Pakistan\u2019s floods weighed on its growth in 2011, but \nSri Lanka\u2019s peace dividend continues to support its expansion. Food price \npressures in India pushed inflation in South Asia to 9.3% in 2010, although \nthat country\u2019s sharp monetary tightening should help bring the subregional \naverage inflation rate down to 8.7% in 2011 and 7.3% in 2012.\n\n\fHighlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xv\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nCentral Asia is benefiting from higher international commodity prices.\nMuch higher prices for the region\u2019s key exports (oil and gas, metals, cotton, \nand gold) supported the recovery (6.6% in 2010) and will stay important \ndrivers. Growth is set to rise slightly to 6.7% in 2011 and 6.9% in 2012. \nFollowing its V-shaped recovery, Kazakhstan will slow somewhat from the \nhigher base as it winds down its anticrisis measures. The non-oil economies \nstrengthened with the economic revival in the Russian Federation (their main \nsource of remittances, trade, and finance). Inflation across the subregion is \nexpected to average 8.2% in 2011, up from 7.1% in 2010, driven by higher \nfood prices in all countries and higher energy prices in the oil importers. \nModeration in food prices in 2012 will provide some relief, and inflation \nshould ease to 6.6%.\n\n Most of the \n\nResource-rich economies will drive growth in the Pacific.\n6.3% growth forecast in 2011 is attributable to the resource-rich economies \nof Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Solomon Islands, which are \nbenefiting from higher global commodity prices, new investment, and \nhigher government revenue from resources. While income from tourism and \nremittances generally picked up in step with the global recovery, most small \nPacific economies are projected to grow only slowly (2% or less). Growth for \nthe subregion should settle back to 5.4% in 2012. Inflation is also picking up \nalongside global commodity prices as these import-dependent countries \ncope with rising world food and oil prices. Inflation is forecast to rise from its \n2010 rate of 5.9% to hit 6.5% in 2011, before falling to 5.6% in 2012.\n\n\fxvi    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nSpecial Theme: South\u2013South Economic Links\n\nGrowing importance of South\u2013South links\n\u2022\n\nThe share of the South in world GDP rose from about 25% in 1980 to \n45% in 2010, of which developing Asia alone contributed two-thirds.\nThe South has burnished its economic credentials on the world stage by \nleading the way out of the global economic crisis, developing Asia in front. \nConcomitantly, it has raised its profile in international governance. The \nemergence of the G20 summit reflects a belated response to this reality.\n\nConcurrent with high growth, South\u2013South links have proliferated.\nTrade and financial integration in the South have intensified in tandem with \nits rising global economic role. Greater integration allows the economies \nof the South to share experiences and to learn from each other. As there is \nno single model for development, it is imperative for countries to diversify \nsources of knowledge and share development experiences. As well as North\u2013\nSouth knowledge exchanges, South\u2013South knowledge sharing is becoming \na reality.\n\nSouth\u2013South links are creating new potential drivers of aggregate \ndemand. Given their reversals in the recent crisis, industrial economies are \nunlikely to drive demand in the world economy any time soon. With their \nstrong prospects for growth, the economies of the South should take up the \nslack. Potentially, the rising consumption of emerging economies and the \nnew investment flows within the South can be new sources of growth for the \nworld economy\u2014but only if the economies of the South become more open \nto trade and capital flows.\n\nExpanding South\u2013South economic links through trade\n\u2022\n\nSouth\u2013South trade has shot up in the past two decades.\nSouthern countries rose from about 7% of world nonfuel merchandise trade \nin 1990 to 17% in 2009. Developing Asia now accounts for about three-\nquarters of South\u2013South trade, and the PRC alone for roughly 40%.\n\n Trade among \n\nThe rise of factory Asia explains most of the rise of South\u2013South trade. \nIntermediate goods are sourced mainly within the region, including Japan, \nfor assembly in the PRC, the regional hub. Final goods are then exported, \npredominantly to affluent markets in the North.\n\nSouth\u2013South trade has grown rapidly for Latin America, Africa, and the \nMiddle East. Although these regions\u2019 trade with the South is relatively small, \nat roughly one-quarter of South\u2013South trade, it has been quickly expanding, \nparticularly with Asia.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\fHighlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xvii\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nTariff levels and other barriers to trade in the South have tumbled in \nthe past two decades, but are still higher than with the North. As a \n2005\u20132008 average, applied tariffs in the South were 9.3%, compared with \n3.2% in the North. Trade-related infrastructure and logistics performance, as \nmeasured by World Bank surveys, shows that the South lags far behind the \nNorth, although it has been closing the gap.\n\nA gradual removal of these remaining bottlenecks would especially spur \nSouth\u2013South trade, where they tend to hold back trade on both sides.\nSimulation analysis suggests that lowering tariff barriers to South\u2013South \ntrade even to the levels prevailing in South\u2013North trade could bring three-\nquarters of the gains to Southern countries of freeing all countries\u2019 goods \ntrade. South\u2013South trade would expand by 6 percentage points as a result. \nHowever, trade reforms supporting South\u2013South trade must not undermine \ncontinuing global integration. In view of the proliferation of regional trade \nagreements in Asia and elsewhere, it is increasingly important that future \nagreements be made as inclusive as possible and ensure compatibility with \nprovisions of the World Trade Organization.\n\nExpanding South\u2013South economic links through investment\n\u2022\n\nIn developing Asia, FDI is by far the most important source of capital \nfrom abroad. Developing Asia received an average of $187 billion in FDI \neach year during the last two decades, which far exceeded the average \nannual combined flows of $126 billion in portfolio and bank investments. \nThe importance of FDI is even clearer given its resilience to external \nshocks, hence serving as a stable source of financial resources to Southern \neconomies.\n\nSouthern countries became sources of outward FDI in the 2000s.\nFDI is among Northern countries, but the share of the South has grown \nfast. By 2009, about a quarter of global inward FDI stocks and about 13% for \noutward FDI stocks were in the South. Developing Asia accounts for more \nthan 70% of developing countries\u2019 outward FDI stocks.\n\n Most \n\nAs part of the deepening of factory Asia production networks, Asian FDI \nhas become more intraregional. Over half the inflows to developing Asia \nare estimated to be regional. The concentration is especially high in East Asia \nand Southeast Asia, stimulated by regional integration efforts, expansion of \nproduction networks, and relocation of production to lower-cost areas within \nthe region.\n\n\fxviii    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nUpgrading South\u2013South links is key to Asian and global growth\n\u2022\n\nSouth\u2013South links can be a new source of global growth, but to \nmaximize potential, structural weaknesses must be overcome. Growing \nSouth\u2013South relations at a time of modest growth in industrial economies \ncould be a potential new driver of global growth. However, this trend does \nnot guarantee sustainable growth for Asia and the global economy, since \nit stems from the rise of factory Asia. Growing South\u2013South links do not \ntherefore necessarily mean greater economic independence from the North.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n The industrial \n\nThe potential for tighter South\u2013South integration is strong.\nmigration associated with South\u2013South FDI helps to enhance the growth \npotential and productive capacity of host Southern economies by filling \ninvestment gaps. Developing Asia could contribute to this if it were to \nrecycle its saving to finance investment in the South (rather than hold it \nin safe assets). Such a move could contribute to the stability of the global \neconomy by promoting rebalancing. It would also encourage regional \nfinancial-market deepening. But the South has to reduce its trade and \ninvestment barriers, which are still high relative to those with the North, to \npromote global and regional integration.\n\nSigns of progress are positive in international cooperation for South\u2013\nSouth links. Cooperation at the bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels \nis broadening. It includes sharing knowledge on development experiences, \nlabor migration, and macroeconomic policy coordination. Here, the role \nof multilateral development banks is crucial as a source of technical and \nfinancial assistance.\n\n\fHighlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xix\n\n                                         Table 1  Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n\nSubregion/Economy\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\nCentral Asia\nAzerbaijan\nKazakhstan\n\nEast Asia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nBangladesh\nIndia\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nSingapore\nThailand\nViet Nam\n\nThe Pacific \nFiji\nPapua New Guinea\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n2008\n\n6.1\n10.8\n3.3\n\n7.3\n9.6\n2.3\n2.3\n0.7\n\n6.3\n6.2\n6.7\n3.7\n6.0\n\n4.2\n6.0\n4.7\n3.7\n1.5\n2.5\n6.3\n\n5.3\n0.2\n6.6\n\n6.7\n\n3.2\n9.3\n1.2\n\n6.8\n9.2\n-2.7\n0.2\n-1.9\n\n7.1\n5.7\n8.0\n1.2\n3.5\n\n1.2\n4.6\n-1.7\n1.1\n-0.8\n-2.3\n5.3\n\n4.2\n-3.0\n5.5\n\n5.9\n\n6.6\n5.0\n7.0\n\n9.6\n10.3\n6.8\n6.1\n10.8\n\n7.9\n5.8\n8.6\n4.1\n7.6\n\n7.8\n6.1\n7.2\n7.3\n14.5\n7.8\n6.8\n\n5.2\n0.1\n7.1\n\n9.0\n\n6.7\n5.8\n6.5\n\n8.4\n9.6\n5.0\n4.6\n4.8\n\n7.5\n6.3\n8.2\n2.5\n8.0\n\n5.5\n6.4\n5.3\n5.0\n5.5\n4.5\n6.1\n\n6.3\n0.5\n8.5\n\n7.8\n\n6.9\n5.8\n6.8\n\n8.1\n9.2\n4.7\n4.6\n5.0\n\n8.1\n6.7\n8.8\n3.7\n8.0\n\n5.7\n6.7\n5.3\n5.3\n4.8\n4.8\n6.7\n\n5.4\n0.8\n6.5\n\n7.7\n\nNotes: Developing Asia refers to 44 developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank and Brunei \nDarussalam, an unclassified regional member; East Asia comprises the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, \nChina; the Republic of Korea; Mongolia; and Taipei,China; Southeast Asia comprises Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and \nViet Nam; South Asia comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka; \nCentral Asia comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \nand Uzbekistan; and The Pacific comprises the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States \nof Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n\nData for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are recorded on a fiscal-year basis.

The asymmetric \nnature of the crisis\u2014a financial crisis in the United States (US) and \nEurope and a trade shock elsewhere\u2014helps to explain this dual outcome, \nas the output effects of a financial crisis tend to persist.\n\nDeveloping Asia will continue to spearhead the global recovery. \nPrivate demand is sustaining growth even as monetary and fiscal policies \nare normalized. The region\u2019s growth in 2011 will remain vigorous, albeit \nsomewhat slower than in 2010. Inflation pressures are building, however, \nand overheating is an emerging threat in some economies. The resurgence \nin global oil and food prices complicates the challenge of \nmanaging inflation.\n\nIn the medium term, sustaining growth requires the global \n\nimbalances that built before the crisis to be unwound. These \nimbalances narrowed significantly during the crisis and remain \nwell below their peaks (Figure 1.1.1). This positive trend will be \ntemporary, though, unless surplus and deficit countries make \nthe necessary structural adjustments to ensure more balanced \ngrowth.\n\nFor developing Asia, that means exploring and fostering \n\nnew sources of growth. Intensifying efforts toward greater \nregional integration will be an important part of that story. \nYet there is huge potential beyond the region\u2019s boundaries. \nDeveloping countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle \nEast\u2014together with developing Asia, the so-called South\u2014also \nrebounded rapidly from the worst effects of the global slump. \nAt a time of modest growth in industrial countries, improved \nSouth\u2013South relations may well become an important new driver for \nglobal growth.\n\n1.1.1  World current account balance\n\nUnited States\nMiddle East\nRest of developing Asia\n\nPeople's Rep. of China\nJapan\n\nOther industrial countries\nRest of the world\n\nRussian Federation\n\n% of world GDP\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n- 1\n\n- 2\n\n1985\n\n90\n\n95\n\n2000\n\n05\n\n10\n\nNote: 2010 data are estimates.\nSource: International Monetary Fund. 2010.

Gross domestic product (GDP) in the US, \neurozone, and Japan together grew by a respectable 2.6% in 2010. While \nthe risk of another recession is receding, it is unclear whether private \ndemand can sustain itself without continued policy stimulus. As a result, \nthe combined GDP in 2011\u20132012 will expand at a somewhat slower \npace than it did during the initial rebound (Table 1.1.1). Global trade \nwill continue to expand at a healthy pace during this period, although \nsomewhat less strongly than in the postcrisis rebound of 2010. \n\nWhile forecasts indicate that the major industrial economies will \ncontinue to recover from the recent downturn, authorities must carefully \nmaneuver around their own particular obstacles: soft labor and housing \nmarkets in the US, vulnerable sovereign debt positions in the eurozone, \nand the aftermath of natural disaster in Japan pose critical risks to \ngrowth. Upward-trending commodity prices add to the uncertainty.\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s robust growth has provided the major industrial \neconomies\u2014and developing economies outside Asia\u2014some much-needed \nsupport during the downturn and recovery. But it is unclear how far the \nregion can extend this role without a firmer industrial-country recovery. \n\n1.1.1  Baseline assumptions for external conditions\n\nGDP growth (%)\nMajor industrial economies a\n\nUnited States\nEurozone\nJapan\n\nWorld trade (% change)\nMerchandise exports\n\nPrices and inflation\nBrent crude spot prices \n\n(average, US$ per barrel)\nEnergy price index (% change)\nFood and beverage price index (% change)\nInflation (major industrial-economy average, %)\n\nInterest rates\nUnited States Federal funds rate (average, %)\nEuropean Union refinancing rate (average, %)\nJapan interest rate (average, %)\nUS$ Libor b (%)\n\n2009\nActual\n\n2010\nActual\n\n2011\nADO 2011 \nprojection\n\n2012\nADO 2011 \nprojection\n\n-12.2\n\n13.5\n\n-3.8\n-2.6\n-4.1\n-6.3\n\n61.7\n\n-36.8\n-13.1\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n1.3\n0.1\n0.3\n\n2.6\n2.9\n1.7\n3.9\n\n79.6\n\n25.9\n11.8\n1.2\n\n0.2\n1.0\n0.1\n0.3\n\n2.1\n2.8\n1.6\n1.5\n\n7.5\n\n17.8\n15.0\n1.3\n\n0.3\n1.0\n0.2\n0.5\n\n2.1\n2.6\n1.6\n1.8\n\n8.5\n\n5.2\n1.0\n1.8\n\n0.6\n1.0\n0.4\n1.0\n\n104.0\n\n112.0\n\na  Average growth rates are weighted by gross national income, Atlas method (current US dollars).  \nb  Average interbank quotations on 1-month loans.\nSources: US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov; Eurostat, \nhttp://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu; Economic and Social Research Institute of Japan, http://www.esri.cao.\ngo.jp; World Trade Organization, http://www.wto.org; Consensus Forecasts; Bloomberg; International \nMonetary Fund, Primary Commodity Prices, http://www.imf.org; World Bank, Global Commodity Markets, \nhttp://www.worldbank.org; ADB estimates.\n\n\fAsia in the uneven global recovery     5\n\nEven with welcome signs of strength in the global environment, several \nrisks underline the need for the region\u2019s policy makers to stay vigilant.\nOne major global development has been a surge of commodity \n\nprices. High and volatile oil and food prices will in particular reverberate \nthrough the world economy, and they are likely to stay that way in 2011\u2013\n2012. They will thus be a significant source of global inflation, especially \nin developing countries where recovery is firmly under way.\n\nOutlook for industrial countries\n\nUnited States: Soft labor and housing markets\n\nThe rise in economic activity continued apace in the US. Industrial \nproduction has picked up gradually (Figure 1.1.2) from the trough in early \n2009, but remains below its precrisis level. Consumer confidence and \nretail sales have been on the rise, although the occasional wobble reflects \nhousehold uncertainty in the strength of the recovery.\n\nReflecting this increased activity, US GDP expanded in all \n\n4 quarters of 2010, the bulk of this coming from a recovery \nof private consumption and investment (including changes \nin inventories) (Figure 1.1.3). The revival of private demand is \npromising, but it is unclear that private demand can sustain \nitself beyond the recently extended fiscal and monetary \nexpansion. \n\nPrivate consumption in particular will stay weighed \ndown by the sluggish housing market and persistently high \nunemployment rate. Households increasing their saving to \nbolster their net worth (which was hammered by the crisis) will \ndamp consumption in the medium term. Self-sustaining growth \nbased on robust private consumption will require concrete \nprogress in both labor and housing markets, and a rebound in \nhouseholds\u2019 net worth. \n\nThe recent outcomes for private investment suggest that \nbusiness owners are still tentative about the future. Inventory \nrestocking (to replenish recession-depleted stocks) made up \na large part of investment growth, rather than increased \ncorporate spending on new plant and equipment. But even here, \na rundown in inventories in the fourth quarter became a drag \non growth.\n\nExternal demand for US goods picked up in 2010. Exports \ngrew by 11.7%, after declining by 9.5% in 2009. But the export \nrise was more than offset by imports, which grew by 12.6% after \ndeclining the previous 2 years. \n\nGrowth moderated from a high of 5.0% (quarter on quarter) \n\n1.1.2  Business activities and consumer confidence \nindicators, United States\n\nConsumer confidence index\n\nRetail sales \n\nIndustrial production \n\nIndex, 2007 = 100\n\n110\n\n80\n\n50\n\n20\n\n4\n\n0\n\n- 4\n\n- 8\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.1.3  Contributions to GDP growth, United States \n\nGross domestic product\nPersonal consumption\nNet exports\n\nGovernment consumption \nGross fixed capital formation\nChange in inventories\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate \n8\n\nQ1\n2009\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n10\n\nSource: US Department of Commerce.

Unemployment has only crept down \nfrom its peak of 9.8% in April 2010 to 8.9% in February 2011 \n(Figure 1.1.5), and long-term unemployment remains high. \n\nIn the 5 years before the crisis (2003\u20132007), the long-term \n\nunemployed made up about 20% of the total and the median duration of \nunemployment was less than 10 weeks. As of February 2011, the share of \nthe long-term unemployed was 44% while the median duration was just \nunder 21 weeks. The economy needs to grow much faster to \nbring these indicators back to their precrisis levels.\n\nSo, too, with housing. Prices have continued to slip, and \nresidential construction has followed suit (Figure 1.1.6). This \nweakness persists, even with low mortgage rates. The low and \nstill falling median price for housing is heavily affected by \nthe overhang of vacant and foreclosed properties. Concerns \nover possible further declines in home values may have kept \npotential homebuyers from looking for mortgages, despite the \nrecent low borrowing rates.\n\nWith continued low inflation and lingering high \nunemployment, monetary policy is expected to remain \nexpansionary in 2011. The Federal Reserve will likely maintain \nthe policy interest rate\u2014the Federal funds rate\u2014at near-zero \nlevels to midyear as it completes its second round of purchases \nof longer-term Treasury securities (so-called quantitative \neasing). Some move toward less expansionary monetary policy \nmay begin toward the end of the year, depending on the \nstrength of the recovery and consumer price movements. \n\nFiscal policy will also remain expansionary in 2011. The \ntemporary tax cuts enacted in 2001 have been extended through \n2012, and the extended period of eligibility for unemployment \nbenefits will continue through end-2011, which should help \nto support demand. Some tightening of other expenditure, \nthough, is expected. As incomes recover and the labor market \nimproves, revenue will increase and unemployment spending \nwill decline. The fiscal position is expected to become less \nexpansionary in 2012.\n\nGrowth in 2011 will be close to its 2010 level, and may well \n\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\noffer a positive surprise. If the policy stimulus contributes to \nfaster than expected recovery of the labor and housing markets, improved \nbusiness and consumer confidence may lift 2011\u2019s growth above the \ncurrent projection of 2.8%. On the downside, households rebuilding their \nbalance sheets will continue to handicap consumption, particularly if \nhousing and labor markets stay soft. \n\nWhile the fiscal stimulus is a recovery driver, the lack of a credible \nmedium-term plan to bring the fast-rising public debt is a growing risk. \n\n1.1.4  Inflation, United States\n\n%, seasonally adjusted\n\nOverall\n\nCore\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nFeb\n11\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 17 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.1.5  Unemployment, United States\n\nShare of long-term unemployed to total unemployed\nRate of unemployed, marginally attached and working part time\nUnemployment rate\n\nMedian duration of unemployment\n\nNumber of weeks\n30\n\nJan\n06\n\nJan\n2005\n\nJan\n09\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 22 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n07\n\nJan\n10\n\nFeb\n11\n\n1.1.6  Housing indicators, United States\nResidential construction value put in place, \nseasonally adjusted annual rate\nMedian price\n\nIndex, 2007 = 100\n\nMortgage rate\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n%\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\fAsia in the uneven global recovery     7\n\nAs the effects of the stimulus fade and concerns over fiscal sustainability \nmount, the outlook for 2012 becomes more uncertain. Growth is forecast \nto slow somewhat to 2.6%.\n\nEurozone: Sovereign debt vulnerabilities\n\nThe eurozone economy picked up from the third quarter of 2009, but \nafter a strong performance in the first half of 2010 it slowed to 0.3% \nquarter on quarter in both the third and fourth quarters. For the whole of \n2010, growth came in at 1.7%.\n\nUncertainty remains high, however, with many downside risks \nclouding the outlook. Externally they relate to shocks that could dent \nthe current global recovery, while internally most are associated with a \npossible disruption from disorderly debt workouts in one or more of the \neurozone\u2019s peripheral economies. Some internal risks reflect the damping \neffect on growth of fiscal austerity packages (and restrictive \nmonetary policies to stem inflation).\n\nNet exports and, to a lesser extent, private consumption \nwere the main contributors to eurozone growth in the third and \nfourth quarters of 2010 (Figure 1.1.7). They had this role against \nthe backdrop of dwindling government spending (as postcrisis \nsupport measures petered out), a drag on GDP from fixed \ncapital investment and inventories, and an exceptionally harsh \nwinter. Pulled by the global recovery and by growing external \ndemand from, especially, the US, the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), and Brazil, eurozone exports to the rest of the world rose \nby 2.2% in the third quarter and by 1.8% in the fourth (quarter \non quarter). In terms of net exports, the trade surplus rose, \nprimarily with the US, benefiting from the recovery there.\nGermany continued to drive export performance\u2014and \n\noverall eurozone economic expansion. The country further consolidated \nits trade surplus and powered ahead with 4.0% growth (year on year) \nin the last quarter of 2010. Far less impressive fourth-quarter growth \nrates were recorded by France (1.5%) and Italy (1.3%), and particularly \nthe troubled peripheral states, where Spain did best with 0.6% \ngrowth, against Greece\u2019s huge 6.6% contraction.\n\nPrivate consumption remained subdued during the whole of \n2010, although edging up somewhat in the last quarter, spurred \nby the holiday season and firming consumer confidence. Retail \ntrade trended upward by 5% (year on year) on average in the \n6 months from July 2010. Consumer confidence was supported \nby a slight improvement in unemployment, which in January \n2011 fell back to 9.9%, after hovering around 10% throughout \n2010. As with growth, eurozone data mask considerable \ndisparity among its members: Spain\u2019s unemployment is above \n20%, almost five times that in the Netherlands or Austria, and \nmore than three times Germany\u2019s. \n\nIndustrial output (except construction) continued its slow, \nupward postcrisis crawl. It was pulled up by accelerating new \nindustrial orders in the fourth quarter of 2010, largely reflecting external \nexport demand for capital goods (Figure 1.1.8). Continuing impetus \nfrom strong industrial new orders, reflected also in the upward-trending \n\n1.1.7  Contributions to GDP growth, eurozone\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGross fixed capital formation\nNet exports\n\nGovernment consumption\nStatistical discrepancy\nChange in stocks\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate \n\nQ1\n2009\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n10\n\nSource: Eurostat. http://www.ec.europa.eu/eurostat (accessed 4 March 2011).  \nClick here for figure data\n\n1.1.8  Industry and services indicators, eurozone\n\nRetail trade\n\nNew orders\n\nProduction excluding construction\n\nJan\n2005\n\nJan\n06\n\nJan\n07\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nNote: Since May 2010 data are classified in accordance with an updated version \nof the Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE rev2) causing a potential \nbreak in series at this date.\nSource: Eurostat. http://www.ec.europa.eu/eurostat (accessed 23 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n4\n\n0\n\n- 4\n\n- 8\n\n- 12\n\n2005 = 100\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n\f8    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nindustrial confidence indicator (Figure 1.1.9), is expected to drive \nup gross fixed capital investment and domestic demand in the \nfirst half of 2011, from their subdued levels in the fourth quarter \nof 2010. \n\nConsumer price inflation is on the rise. It reached 2.4% \nin February 2011 (Figure 1.1.10), up from 2.3% a month earlier \nand from an average of 1.6% in 2010. The most recent upward \npressures reflect the global rise in energy and commodity prices, \nwhich some parts of the eurozone saw reinforced by their higher \nexposure to the fallout from the unrest in North Africa and the \nMiddle East. Pushed by external factors, inflation is projected \nat 2.3% in 2011, but is expected to fall back to 1.9% in 2012. This \ndeceleration assumes the return of a more favorable external \nenvironment, and reflects still moderate upward pressures \non wages, as the output gap narrows and a more restrictive \nmonetary policy takes effect. \n\nPolicy interest rates are poised to rise. In early March, \nthe European Central Bank hinted for the first time at an \nimminent increase in its reference rates, up from the 1% \nmark it has maintained during the entire postcrisis recovery. \nWorries remain that rate hikes in the months ahead could \nadd to the difficulties not only of the eurozone\u2019s most troubled \ncountries, primarily Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, but also of \nits larger economies, such as Italy and Spain, both of which \nhave embarked on stringent fiscal austerity packages. To avoid \nweakening the eurozone\u2019s already fragile growth prospects, the \ncentral bank is likely to favor a gradual and soft approach rather \nthan aggressive tightening.\n\nThe bloc is expected to continue expanding at about 1.6% \n\nin both 2011 and 2012, supported by the global recovery\u2014\nparticularly in the US and emerging markets\u2014and by vigorous \ndomestic demand on the back of growing consumer and \nmanufacturing confidence. \n\nContinued finance sector recovery and banks\u2019 expanded \n\naccess to money markets will be key to sustaining the momentum. \nWeaknesses remain, however, as banks\u2019 balance sheets are still \nconstrained, and lending to households has been very slow \nto pick up. In sovereign bonds, market confidence improved \ntemporarily in November last year, coinciding with the \n\u20ac67.5 billion bailout of Ireland. Such emergency funding by the \nEuropean Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) to Ireland, and to Greece earlier in 2010, will keep these \ncountries from having to access the markets for 2 or more years. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of soaring 10-year government \nbond credit default swaps for Greece, Ireland, and Portugal \n(Figure 1.1.11), EU leaders agreed to increase the lending capacity \nof the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund at EU summits held on 11 and \n24\u201325 March. The commitments were to increase the fund to \n\u20ac440 billion (up from its current \u20ac250 billion), by increasing \nguarantees or paid-up capital.

In the eurozone, the main manifestations of \ngrowing divergence were the emergence of sizable and \npersistent current account deficits in Greece, Portugal, and \nSpain (and to a lesser extent France and Italy), mirrored \nby high current account surpluses in northern eurozone \ncountries, especially Germany and the Netherlands. Ireland \nshows a persistent trade surplus, but high factor income \npayments abroad had increasingly contributed to a current \naccount deficit (Box figure 1). \n\n1  Current account\n\nGermany\nItaly\n\nGreece\nPortugal\n\nIreland\nSpain\n\n% of GDP\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n03\n\n05\n\n07\n\n09\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\nSource: European Commission, Directorate General for \nEconomic and Financial Affairs, Annual Macro-economic \nDatabase. http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_\nindicators/ameco (accessed 1 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nFurther, the buildup of large current account deficits in \nperipheral countries was accompanied by a steady decline \nin competitiveness, as shown by relative unit labor costs \n(Box figure 2).

The pact aims to \nincrease competitiveness and tighten convergence among \nthe countries of the eurozone. Under the pact, measurable \nyearly targets for key objectives would be enshrined \nin national legislation, to increase peer pressure and \naccountability. The pact also includes an agreement on a \nnumerical debt-reduction benchmark. \n\nWith reform and fiscal discipline commitments by \nits debt-stressed members anchored in this way and the \nEuropean Stability Mechanism coming into place as a \npermanent financial backstop facility, eurozone leaders \nhope to have found a response strong enough to assuage \nfinancial market sentiment now and to avert similar crises \ndown the road. So far, market reactions have been muted. \n\n\f10    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nJapan: Uncertainty compounded by disaster \n\nGDP grew by 3.9% in 2010, after contracting by 6.3% in 2009. Rebounding \nexports, the low 2009 base, and a series of fiscal stimulus packages \nboosted growth. External demand contributed 1.8 percentage points of \nGDP growth, with domestic demand accounting for the rest.\n\nPrivate consumption rose by 1.8% in 2010, largely due to fiscal \nstimulus packages on household appliances and passenger cars, making \na 1.1 percentage point contribution to total growth. After that surge, \nhowever, consumption was flat in the fourth quarter (Figure 1.1.12). \nGrowth in real exports, after a strong rebound in the first half, fell by \n0.8% in the fourth quarter from the third. \n\nA sluggish labor market continues to weigh on private consumption. \n\nUnemployment is high and job offers remain well below precrisis \nlevels. Nominal wages grew strongly in the first half of 2010, \nmainly in manufacturing, before decelerating in the second, and \nwith the labor market expected to improve only gradually, labor \nincome is unlikely to make much headway in 2011.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was generally weak in 2010, but \nhas started to recover in recent months (Figure 1.1.13). Healthy \ncorporate profits will add further momentum but lingering \nexcess capacity will remain a drag. Housing investment has \nalso started to recover. Inventory adjustment, along with lower \nmortgage rates and housing prices, boosted housing sales, \nmainly of owner-occupied houses and condominiums.\n\nPrior to the earthquake and tsunami (Box 1.1.2), the overall \n\noutlook was mixed. The slower growth of global trade, fading \neffects of the fiscal stimulus, and labor market weakness all \npointed to deceleration in the years ahead. The recent tragedy \nfurther clouds the immediate prospects for Japan as well as the \nglobal outlook. \n\nThe one area where the earthquake may have a lasting and \n\nsizable impact is the global energy market. More precisely, to \nthe extent that Japan\u2019s unfolding nuclear crisis raises long-term \nworldwide concerns about the safety of nuclear energy, it may \nprecipitate a structural shift in the global energy mix. \n\nOverall then, aside from energy, the regional and global \nimpact of the Japanese earthquake is hard to quantify but likely \nto be temporary and limited.\n\nIncluding the impact of the earthquake and tsunami, Japan\u2019s \n\nreal GDP is projected to grow at 1.5% in 2011 and 1.8% in 2012 \n(2011 a shade lower than predisaster projections but 2012 a \ntouch higher). This benign baseline scenario assumes no major \naftershocks, extended power shortages, or massive radiation \nleaks from the Fukushima plant.\n\nIn looking over the performance of the major industrial \neconomies, it is clear that\u2014despite the severity of the recent \ncrisis and the lingering uncertainties\u2014they have returned to \ngrowth. Also that developing Asia\u2019s support arrived at a critical time.\n\n1.1.12  Contributions to GDP growth, Japan\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\n\nPrivate investment\nPublic investment\n\nNet exports\nResidual\n\nPercentage points\n\n24\n\n12\n\n0\n\n-12\n\n-24\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\nQ1\n2009\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n10\n\nSource: Economic and Social Research Institute.

This region accounts for around \n6% of Japan\u2019s GDP, 7% of its population, and 7% of the \nprivate sector capital stock.\n\nHow the disaster will affect 2011 GDP growth is hard \n\nto quantify since it is still unfolding. Economic activity \nin the Tohoku region will be severely hit in the short run \ndue to extensive damage to production facilities, transport, \nand other infrastructure. The earthquake has also caused \nsubstantial power shortages related to the shutdown of \nthree nuclear facilities in the area. Nuclear power supplies \na third of Japan\u2019s electricity and power companies have \nalready put into place a program of rolling blackouts. \n\nPossible erosion of consumer and business confidence \n\nis an intangible factor. An improvement of consumer \nconfidence after December 2008 had stalled from May \n2010, reflecting the mixed outlook and overall uncertainty \n(Box figure). One huge short-term influence on confidence \nis how well the authorities contain the radiation leakage \nfrom Fukushima nuclear plant.\n\nConsumer confidence, Japan\n\nJan 2005 = 100\n\nJan\n2006\n\nJan\n07\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\n \n\nFeb\n11\n\nSource: Economic and Social Research Institute.

For \n\nexample, right after the disaster, the stock market \n\nplummeted while the yen rose to a post\u2013Second World \nWar high on expectations that Japanese firms would \nrepatriate profits to bolster domestic balance sheets. G7 \ncoordination has, though, stemmed the currency\u2019s rise, \nwhich would have dented confidence and prospects.\nA rough parallel is the Kobe earthquake, whose \nimpact on growth turned out to be modest. Many local \nmacroeconomic indicators initially fell but quickly reverted \nto their predisaster levels. The recovery was spearheaded \nby government reconstruction spending, which paved the \nway for a robust rebound in private investment. \n\nThe magnitude of both damage and the funding for \nrecovery are likely to be much larger than for Kobe. At \nthat time, the damage to buildings, roads, and other \ninfrastructure amounted to about 2% of GDP, and the \nfiscal outlays for reconstruction totaled little more than \n\u00a53 trillion. Market estimates of the damage from the \nTohoku earthquake are in the range of $150 billion\u2013$200 \nbillion, or 3%\u20134% of GDP. \n\nBeyond the very short term, Japan\u2019s economic prospects \nare less dire, assuming that the nuclear crisis at Fukushima \nis brought under control. Private consumption and \nproduction are now falling but capital-stock rebuilding, \nlargely financed by the government, will exert a positive \neffect in the longer run.\n\nThe one caveat to this optimistic longer-term view is \nthat the fiscal demands of post-earthquake reconstruction \nwill impose new burdens at a time when net public debt is \nover 120% of GDP. The lack of fiscal space may constrain \nthe positive effect of the recovery-related government \nstimulus by requiring higher taxes. In addition, the \nfunding demands of reconstruction may exacerbate \nfinancial market jitters about debt sustainability. Monetary \npolicy, however, can afford to remain expansionary given \nnear-zero inflation before the disaster, which should help \nto contain government borrowing costs. \n\n110\n\n90\n\n70\n\n50\n\nConsumer confidence, Japan\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s role in the global recovery\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s prospects have long depended on the economic health \nof the major industrial countries, the main markets for the region\u2019s \nexports. When Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and other \neconomies were hit by the late 1990s\u2019 Asian financial crisis, demand for \ntheir goods from the US and the rest of the world constituted the primary \ndriver of recovery. Even now, the drop in industrial-country demand \nduring the recent global downturn showed that developing Asia is not \nimmune to a deep recession originating from outside. \n\nBut a notable shift is under way, one that accelerated during the crisis. \n\nThe region itself is now exerting greater impact on the global economy. \nIncreasingly, the region\u2019s own outlook will affect the prospects of the \n\n\f2009\n2000\n1990\n\n1.1.14  Share of exports to Asia-10 in total exports, eight \neconomies\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2009\n\nBrazil\n\nMexico\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nJapan\n\nUnited States\n\nBrazil\n\nMexico\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nJapan\n\nUnited States\n\n12    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nrest of the world, including the major industrial countries. \nThe rising economic influence of developing Asia is a result of \nits change into a major player in the global landscape. In fact, \nwhen developing Asia and Japan are considered together, they \nare one of three main hubs of the global economy, along with \nthe US and EU. And the region is now the world\u2019s largest net \nexporter of capital. \n\nThe crisis in fact marks a significant milestone, proving that \n\nthe region has evolved and can now withstand even a colossal \nexternal shock. When the financial crisis that originated in \nthe US intensified and led to a collapse in output and trade, \nthe region\u2019s surprising resilience had global benefits. When \nexport demand elsewhere was drying up, developing Asia\u2019s \nunexpectedly strong demand provided some much-needed \nrelief\u2014but to what extent? \n\nQuantifying developing Asia\u2019s role in the recovery\n\nThe relative importance of developing Asia and the PRC in \ntrade has grown, pointing to their growing role as importers. \nFor a group of eight countries, Figure 1.1.14 shows the share \nof the region (proxied by 10 developing Asian economies \naccounting for the bulk of the region\u2019s output and trade) in their \nexports, and Figure 1.1.15 the PRC\u2019s share. The eight economies \nare the four largest industrial economies and four of the largest \ndeveloping economies. (South Africa is the biggest economy in \nAfrica; Brazil and Mexico the two largest economies of Latin \nAmerica; and Saudi Arabia the biggest in the Middle East.) \n As a large and growing market for the world\u2019s goods, \ndeveloping Asia contributed to the global recovery through \ntrade\t(Figure\t1.1.16).\tGermany,\tfor\texample,\texported\t$52\tbillion\t\nto\tthe\tPRC\tand\t$103\tbillion\tto\tAsia-10\tin\t2009,\twhen\tBrazil\t\nexported\t$19\tbillion\tto\tthe\tPRC\tand\t$32\tbillion\tto\tAsia-10.\t\nFurther, exports are growing rapidly, even for countries whose \ntrade with the region is relatively limited. For example, South \nAfrica\u2019s\texports\tto\tAsia-10\tshot\tup\tfrom\t$250\tmillion\tin\t1990\tto\t\n$3.1\tbillion\tin\t2000\tand\tfurther\tto\t$12\tbillion\tin\t2009.\t\n\nIn the depth of the crisis and the early recovery, continued \nstrong export growth to developing Asia shows that the region \nwas indeed providing much-needed demand, even while \nmarkets in the rest of the world contracted (Figure 1.1.17). \nFor both the industrial economies and the non-Asian \ndeveloping countries, there is a marked difference between the \ngrowth of exports to Asia-10 and the rest of the world. In fact, \nfor all eight economies, during the crisis the average growth \nrate of exports to Asia-10 exceeded export growth to the rest of \nthe world. For the US, for instance, the average growth rate was \n5.5% for the Asia-10 but a contraction of 0.4% for the rest of the \nworld. Even more strikingly, for Brazil, the figures are 25.4% and \na contraction of 0.9%. \n\nOf particular interest is the role of the PRC.

As with exports to Asia-10, exports to the PRC from \nthe eight economies outpaced exports to the rest of the world \n(Figure 1.1.18). For example, for the US, the average growth \nrate was 10.9% for the PRC but flat for the rest of the world. \nFor Brazil, the corresponding figures are a staggering 34.0% \nand 0.2%.\n\nTo sum up, developing Asia\u2014the PRC in particular\u2014\n\nprovided much-needed support to the global recovery as a major \nmarket for the world\u2019s products around the crisis. Demand in \nthe region had itself been supported by the unprecedented fiscal \nstimulus that authorities rolled out in the face of collapsing \nexternal demand and weak private demand. The PRC\u2019s 11% of \nGDP, 2009\u20132010 stimulus program attracted much attention \nbut across the region governments aggressively boosted public \nspending and cut taxes. Although fiscal expansions were \nmotivated by domestic needs, the demand support in developing \nAsia had positive global spillovers.\n\nAlthough trade was the most important, there were \nother channels. Purchases of US, EU, and Japanese sovereign \nbonds by regional governments provided support during the \nrecovery. Those purchases kept down the cost of borrowing \nfor the industrial-country governments, thus facilitating their \ncountercyclical fiscal expansion, and helping to stave off a \ndeeper recession. This approach will, however, need to be \nunwound as recovery progresses to avoid the reemergence of the \nunsustainable global imbalances that were a contributing factor \nto the recent financial turmoil.\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s strength has been a rare shaft of light in \nan otherwise gloomy environment. And as the major industrial \ncountries face their own internal challenges to recovery, the \nreturn of higher global oil and food prices presents further \ncomplications for the region.\n\nBrazil\nMexico\nSaudi Arabia\nSouth Africa\n\nFrance\nGermany\nJapan\nUnited States\n\nBrazil\nMexico\nSaudi Arabia\nSouth Africa\n\nFrance\nGermany\nJapan\nUnited States\n\nResurgence of global oil and food prices\nThe sharp rises in global commodity prices\u2014before and after the crisis\u2014\nhave substantial repercussions on developing Asia\u2019s economy. Immediately \nbefore\tthe\tglobal\tcrisis,\toil\tprices\tleaped\tto\taround\t$150\tin\tJuly\t2008\t\nand the price of food and other commodities also jumped. As the world \neconomy went into a deep recession and global trade collapsed, global \ncommodity prices also tumbled. \n\nThey subsequently rebounded on the back of the global recovery, \n\naccelerating in the second half of 2010, so much so that nonenergy \ncommodity prices\u2014agricultural products, metals and minerals, and \nraw materials\u2014have reached record highs. Two commodities\u2014oil and \nfood\u2014are especially important for developing Asia. \n\nGlobal oil price trends and prospects \n\nDuring the first 8 months of 2010, oil prices remained relatively stable, \noscillating\twithin\ta\tlimited\trange\tof\t$75\u2013$85\ta\tbarrel.\tDespite\trobust\t\n\n\f14    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nglobal demand growth, particularly in Asia, persistently high \ninventory levels capped price escalation, as did lingering \nuncertainty over the recovery of industrial countries. \n\nSince September, however, prices have shown a sustained \nincrease\t(Figure\t1.1.19).\tBrent\tcrude\tclimbed\tfrom\t$77\ta\tbarrel\t\non\t1\tSeptember\tto\t$96\tat\tend-year\tand\twas\tnearly\t$120\tby\t\nmid-March. \n\nBoth demand- and supply-side factors explain the rise. \nGrowing market perceptions of firmer industrial-country \nrecovery lifted demand, as did the exceptionally cold winter \nin Asia and Europe. Disruption of supply from Libya, which \nnormally exports around 1.3 million barrels per day (mbd) \npushed up prices. The indirect effect from Libya has been much \nbigger, triggering broader geopolitical concerns about Middle \nEast supply.\n\nGlobal oil demand strengthened steadily during 2010, from 86.5 mbd \n\nin the first quarter to 88.9 mbd in the fourth. For the year as a whole, \nglobal demand averaged 87.7 mbd. Year on year, global oil demand rose \nby 3.2% relative to 2009, the strong growth partly reflecting a rebound \nfrom weak demand. Demand from countries in the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) grew by 1.4% and \ndemand from non-OECD economies by 5.2%, reflecting the two-speed \nglobal recovery. Within the non-OECD group, Asian demand climbed by \n5.7%, fueled by the PRC\u2019s oil-demand growth of 12.6%. \n\nGlobal oil demand will remain robust in the short run as the world \n\nrecovery continues. Demand growth is projected at a shade under 2% \nin 2011, mirroring projected global growth and its twin-track \npattern\u2014OECD demand flat in 2011 but non-OECD demand to \nrise by around 4%.\n\nHealthy inventory levels and adequate spare capacity will, \nthough, contain price pressures. Global oil supply is set to rise \nby around 2 mbd in 2011, with members of the Organization \nof the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC \ncountries each contributing about half the projected growth. \nA supply-side development with major longer-term \n\nramifications is the recovery of Iraqi output, which may rise by \nas much as 700,000 barrels in 2011. The restoration of political \nstability and security in Iraq, which has vast reserves, has led \nto a substantial increase in investment and production. Outside \nOPEC, Brazilian output is likely to be ramped up substantially \nin 2011, due to recently developed offshore fields. \n\nThe relatively benign global supply outlook has contributed \nto substantial spare OPEC capacity (Figure 1.1.20). This cushion \nis unlikely to shrink noticeably in the short term and will guard \nagainst sharp price surges. \n\nThe high inventories maintained by OECD countries are \nanother limiter of price spikes (Figure 1.1.21). The inventory \nlevels declined somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2010 and \nthe decline is set to fall further in the first quarter of 2011 \nbut overall supply and demand factors make a sharp fall in \ninventories unlikely.\n\nPrice of Brent crude\n\n1.1.19  Price of Brent crude\n\nJan\n2009\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n10\n\nMar\n11\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 16 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nOPEC effective spare capacity\n\n1.1.20  OPEC effective spare capacity\n\nMillion barrels/day\n\nJan\n07\n\nJan\n2006\n\nJan\n08\nSource: JP Morgan Energy Strategy.\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nSep\n\nOECD oil inventories\n\n1.1.21  OECD oil inventories\n\nBillion barrels\n\nJan\n2010\n\n \n\nApr\n\n \n\nJul\n\n \n\nOct\n\n \n\nDec\n\nSource: JP Morgan Energy Strategy.\nClick here for figure data\n\n$/barrel\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2.9\n\n2.8\n\n2.7\n\n2.6\n\n\fThe civil conflict in Libya, which erupted in February 2011, \nhas the potential to be very disruptive to oil supplies. Libya is an \nOPEC member and ranks among the top 15 exporters. It usually \npumps around 1.6 mbd but output may have fallen by more \nthan half. \n\nPrices will be higher in both 2011 and 2012 due to the Libya \n\nfactor, and there has been a significant increase in market \nexpectations for oil prices since the outbreak of the fighting \nthere (Figure 1.1.22). Those same expectations suggest, however, \nthat the Libya effect will be limited, as evident in the decline \nin medium-term forward prices between 21 February and \n16 March. The broader implication is that market perceptions of \nsupply and demand fundamentals remain unchanged. Libya is \nlikely to be a temporary shock unless instability threatens the \nentire Middle East. \n\nThe baseline medium-term outlook is still grounded on \nadequate spare capacity, bolstered by expansion of global output \nuntil the middle of this decade. The risk in that period of a \nsharp escalation is modest. Japan\u2019s disaster may, however, have \nmedium-term ramifications if it leads to a significant shift of \nglobal energy demand from nuclear power to oil.\n\nGlobal food price trends and prospects\nGlobal food prices are set to remain high in 2011.1 They have \nclimbed sharply since bottoming in early 2009 and accelerated \nfast in the second half of 2010, as part of a broader surge in \ncommodity prices enveloping oil and energy, metals, nonenergy, \nand agriculture (Figure 1.1.23). \n\nThe world witnessed a similar commodity boom \n\nimmediately before the global crisis. After commodity prices \nreverted to their historic trend levels in late 2008 as a result of \nthe global slump, it was widely believed that they would rise \nat a moderate speed in the medium term. The events of the \nlast few months have realigned expectations. In fact, while oil \nremains well below its peak of July 2008, many food and other \nnonenergy commodities have reached new highs. \n\nIn February 2011, for example, the benchmark index for \nfood prices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations reached the highest level (nominal and real) \nsince its inception in January 1990. The index went up by 34.2% \nrelative to a year earlier, driven by cereals, edible oils, and dairy \nproducts (Figure 1.1.24). \n\nFortunately, though, the price of rice\u2014along with wheat \n\none of the two staple cereals produced and consumed in \nAsia\u2014moved up less rapidly in June 2010\u2013February 2011, by \n17% (Figure 1.1.25). A key difference with the food-price crisis \nof 2007\u20132008, this rise was moderate partly because Thailand \nand Viet Nam released ample supplies from their rice stocks \nto mitigate rising price pressures. The price of wheat, however, \nalmost doubled in the same period.\n\nDomestic rice and wheat prices in many developing Asian \n\nAsia in the uneven global recovery     15\n\n01 Jun 2010\n21 Feb 2011\n\n01 Dec 2010\n16 Mar 2011\n\n1.1.22  NYMEX futures price, West Texas Intermediate \n\n16 Mar 2011\n\n21 Feb 2011\n\n01 Dec 2010\n\n01 Jun 2010\n\nSep\n\nMar\n2011\n\nMar\n12\n\nSep\n\nSep\n\nSep\n\nDec\n\nMar\n13\n\nMar\n14\n\nMar\n15\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 16 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.1.23  Commodity price indexes\nMetals and minerals\n\nEnergy\n\nNonenergy\n\nAgriculture\n\n2000 = 100\n\nJan\n2006\n\nJan\n07\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: World Bank.

Domestic \nrice prices went up, for example, by 21.4% in Bangladesh, 21.6% in \nIndonesia, and 36.7% in Viet Nam from June 2010 to February 2011. \nBut while international wheat prices rose by 99.6% in the 8 months to \nFebruary 2011, domestic wheat price increases in the region in local \ncurrency terms generally did not exceed 70%. \n\nThe food price surge was triggered by weather-related production \nshortfalls and reinforced by cyclical factors. In the second half of 2010, \ncrops failed in Australia, Europe, North America, and Argentina. In \naddition, the worst La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern in three decades led to \nwidespread flooding in many food-producing countries. Corn, coffee, rice, \nwheat, and sugar output have all been hit. The strong economic recovery \n(boosting demand for food) and rising oil prices (raising input costs) also \nplayed a role.\n\nStructural factors that are driving long-term demand trends also \n\ncome into play in the current price surge. Such factors include a \ngrowing world population, strong income growth in emerging \neconomies, and changing diets from staple foods toward \nincreased consumption of meats. The supply\u2013demand balance \nin global food markets has tightened, as reflected in a decline in \nstock-to-use ratios for corn, rice, and wheat since around 2000 \n(Figure 1.1.26). \n\nGlobal food prices are likely to remain elevated and volatile \nin the short term. Grain stocks have been falling as production \nhas been unable to meet demand. Production in 2011 will \ntherefore be crucial in determining stability in global markets. \nSupply uncertainties are also rising on weather disturbances. \n\nThe international price of wheat is expected to remain high, \n\nexacerbated by the ongoing drought in the major wheat-producing belt in \nthe PRC and extremely low global inventory stocks. The outlook for rice \nis more uncertain but upward pressures will persist if La Ni\u00f1a weather \nconditions continue to affect production. \n\nRisks to the global outlook\nAlthough the global recovery is showing signs of firming, it is still uneven \nand laden with risks. The risks to the outlook for the major industrial \ncountries differ, but weakness in one could undermine recovery in the \nothers\u2014and have spillover effects globally. Developing countries are more \nsusceptible to instability originating from rising commodity prices, and \nfor those developing countries that have bounced back fastest from the \nrecent downturn, overheating is a growing concern. \n\nPersistent weakness of labor and housing markets in the United States\n\nThe health of the US economy has a strong impact on the global economy. \nThe immediate prospects for the country have brightened somewhat with \nthe support of monetary and fiscal stimulus, but it is still unclear whether \nprivate demand is strong enough to stand on its own. Persistent weakness \nof the labor and housing markets in particular are a drag on private \nconsumption and investment. \n\nDespite unemployment falling to 8.9% in February, without more \n\n1.1.26  Stock-to-use ratios of selected grains\n\nCorn\n\nRice\n\nWheat\n\n%\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1960\n\n70\n\n80\n80\n\n90\n\n2000\n\n02\n\n04\n\n06\n\n08\n\n10\n\nSource: United States Department of Agriculture.

A weak housing market inhibits \nhouseholds from repairing their balance sheets, and may also prevent \nworkers from moving to more promising locations for jobs.\n\nSovereign debt risk in the eurozone\n\nThe sovereign debt problems pose a serious downside risk for \ninternational financial markets. The wide spreads between 10-year \ngovernment-bond yields for Germany and for peripheral countries\u2014\nGreece and Ireland in particular\u2014show that the markets have real \ndoubts about these two countries\u2019 fiscal sustainability. Although the \nEU and IMF averted a crisis in 2010, the risk of disorderly debt crisis \nremains. \n\nThese two economies are small, but crisis in either of them could \njeopardize the financial stability of the eurozone, the EU, and beyond, \ngiven the substantial financial links between them and the eurozone\u2019s \ncore economies. Such disruptions have the potential to spill over into \nglobal financial markets as well.\n\nUncertain aftermath of the disaster in Japan\n\nIt is premature to gauge the full economic impact of the huge \nearthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on 11 March 2011, either for \nJapan or the rest of the world. The effects of such natural disasters \nare typically large in the short run, when production is disrupted and \nprivate consumption suffers. Given the role of Japanese firms in global \nproduction networks, supply-chain disruptions could impede growth \nelsewhere, particularly where suitable replacements are not readily \navailable. In the longer run, government reconstruction programs will \nhelp to revive private investment. \n\nThe benign baseline scenario of quick normalization assumes \nthat there will be no major aftershocks, extended power shortages, or \nwidespread radiation contamination (discussed further in Box 1.2.2 \nbelow).\n\nFiscal risks in industrial economies\n\nFiscal risks manifest themselves differently in the eurozone, US, and \nJapan. Those eurozone peripheral countries facing mounting concerns \nover their sovereign debt are pursuing austerity programs to improve \ntheir public finances. While such programs are necessary to avert default \nand bolster market confidence, they act as a drag on economic activity (as \nseen in Greece\u2019s shocking contraction). The slowdown of growth may then \nhit tax revenue and worsen the fiscal position in the short run. \n\nIn the US and Japan, fiscal risks stem from failure to develop \nmedium-term consolidation plans. Both countries face a dilemma, \nbecause the fragility of their recoveries calls for a continued \naccommodative fiscal stance. In Japan, the dilemma is further heightened \nby the expected fiscal burden of disaster relief and recovery efforts \nstemming from the earthquake and tsunami. Given the escalation of \npublic debt in both countries, such a failure could erode financial market \nconfidence, which would push up borrowing costs, further exacerbating \nthe problem.\n\n\f18    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nHigh and volatile global commodity prices\n\nThe return of global growth, combined with lack of readily available \nspare production capacity, is driving demand for both oil and food. \nThe narrowing of the gap between demand and potential global supply, \nalong with the erratic recovery of the major industrial countries, will \ncause greater price volatility. The probability of a sustained surge of food \nprices in 2011 remains limited, however, because temporary supply factors \nwere largely in play. Still, the short-term outlook for high and volatile \ncommodity prices will add to inflation pressures, especially in high-\ngrowth developing countries.\n\nRisk of overheating in fast-growing developing countries\n\nRobust recovery and growth are giving rise to incipient overheating \nand inflation pressures in some developing countries. Risks here are \nnotably evident in fast-growing developing Asia and are becoming \napparent in other areas, such as parts of Latin America. Capital inflows \nand rising commodity prices may exacerbate asset and consumer price \ninflation. Any failure by policy makers to damp overheating pressures \nwill jeopardize macroeconomic stability and growth. Given the current \ndependence of global growth on developing-country dynamism, this \nwould cloud the global outlook. \n\nThe global recession may have ended, but its aftereffects linger. While \n\nadvanced economies are struggling, the prospects for developing Asia \nare much more positive. Yet even there the risks are tilted toward the \ndownside. \n\n\fAsia in the uneven global recovery     19\n\nFirming recovery in \ndeveloping Asia\n\nDeveloping Asia is on a firm path of recovery. The policies that were \nput in place at the onset of the recent global turmoil set the stage \nfor strong performance last year. Low inflation from the weak global \ndemand allowed policy makers to respond aggressively with fiscal and \nmonetary stimulus. Consequently, 2010 growth for most countries in the \nregion surprised on the high side relative to the forecasts in the Asian \nDevelopment Outlook 2010.\n\nA year ago, the question facing policy makers was how to time the \nnormalization of fiscal and monetary policies to avoid undermining the \nnascent rebound. At that time, the risk of overheating was much lower \nbecause of the soft global demand, hence erring on the side of continued \nstimulus made sense. Now that the region\u2019s growth is on a more solid \nfooting, it is time to reevaluate that approach. Many of the stimulus \nmeasures are being wound down, but the fiscal and monetary stances are \nnot yet back to their precrisis positions.\n\nThe region\u2019s continued rapid growth is far from guaranteed, and as \ndiscussed in the previous section, the global recovery faces many risks. \nThe region\u2019s outlook, however, is for continued strong growth in 2011\u2013\n2012, but with the threat of inflation looming closer. When weighing their \nmacroeconomic policy choices, many of developing Asia\u2019s policy makers \nsee that the balance has tipped toward avoiding overheating.\n\nRecent trends and outlook\nDeveloping Asia bounced back rapidly from the effects of the global \nrecession and will consolidate these gains in the coming years. The \nregion is projected to grow by 7.8% in 2011 and 7.7% in 2012 (Figure 1.2.1). \nGrowth in 2011, as in 2010, will be broad-based, and rest on \nboth domestic and external demand. Private consumption \nand investment are expected to take over as the mainstay of \ndomestic demand. \n\nThe region\u2019s moderation from the rapid 9.0% growth in 2010 \n\nstems from slower growth of the major industrial economies, \nmore measured expansion of world trade, and the unwinding \nof fiscal and monetary stimulus. The exceptional performance \nof 2010 was partly due to the base effect, following the relatively \nslow growth in 2009. The moderation marks a welcome return \nto growth rates that can be sustained without aggravating price \npressures.\n\nAlthough macroeconomic policies are heading back to \n\ntheir precrisis positions, most are still accommodative relative to 2008. \nPrice pressures are building, and some countries may need to act \npreemptively to corral inflation before it accelerates further.

The uptick is being \ndriven by a combination of external factors (global oil and \nfood price shocks) and the robust domestic recovery. Although \nmany central banks have already taken action, inflation is \nexpected to accelerate further to 5.3% in 2011 before tapering \noff to 4.6% in 2012.\n\nAll subregions of developing Asia performed well in 2010. \nThey are expected to continue to do so in the next 2 years, if the \nmajor risks are not realized.\n\nEast Asia rebounded strongly in 2010 (Figure 1.2.2), led by \nthe return of the PRC to double-digit growth. Aggregate GDP \nfor the five economies in this subregion expanded by 9.6%, \nfaster than the rest of developing Asia. Growth in the PRC of \n10.3% was powered by a continuing surge in investment and \nrobust private consumption, and its external trade flows fully \nrecovered from the slowdown in 2009. The recovery in world demand \nfor manufactured goods benefited the subregion\u2019s newly industrialized \neconomies (Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China), \nand rising demand for raw materials boosted Mongolia. East Asia is \nexpected to moderate somewhat, to 8.4% in 2011 and 8.1% in 2012, as \npolicy stimulus measures are withdrawn.\n\nThe PRC\u2019s resilience helped speed the recovery in East and \n\nSoutheast Asia (Box 1.2.1). Even in 2009\u2014the trough of the \nglobal recession\u2014the PRC grew by 9.2% while world output was \nflat and global trade contracted.\n\nInflation in the East Asian economies is forecast to pick \nup in 2011, owing to higher global prices of commodities and \noil, reinforced by robust domestic demand. The subregional \ninflation rate is put at 4.3% in 2011, easing to 3.9% in 2012.\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s exceptionally strong recovery in 2010 \n(Figure 1.2.3) reflected the steep rebounds of the more open \neconomies. Aggregate growth propelled to 7.8% from just 1.2% \nin 2009, largely driven by Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, \nwhose economies had contracted during the global slump of 2009. Other \nmajor economies in this subregion\u2014Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet \nNam\u2014also registered solid growth, after slowdowns in the previous year. \nRecoveries in exports and investment underpinned expansion. Growth is \nexpected to step down in light of the higher 2010 base, a moderation in \nexport growth, and policy tightening by governments. GDP will \nexpand by 5.5% in 2011 and 5.7% 2012.\n\nInflation in Southeast Asia is accelerating. Consumer \nprices in the subregion rose by a moderate 4.0% on average in \n2010, picking up to 5.1% in 2011. However, inflation pressures \nhave been more tenacious in some countries\u2014Viet Nam, for \nexample, is expected to hit double digits. Subregional inflation is \nexpected to come down to 4.2% in 2012, with appropriate policy \nresponses and slower growth in global commodity prices. \nSouth Asia was less affected by the crisis and growth \nremained fairly strong throughout, dipping only slightly when \nthe global recession hit its nadir (Figure 1.2.4).

The PRC\u2019s \nemergence as a global heavyweight is fueling hopes that it \ncan supplement the US as an additional source of demand \nand growth. Those hopes are especially pronounced in \nEast and Southeast Asia, which have close trade links with \nthe PRC. \n\nThe box figure shows quarterly export volumes from the \n\ntwo subregions to the PRC. Their export volumes to the \nPRC decreased by 10%\u201350% during the global downturn but \nin most cases more than fully recovered to starting levels. \nThis suggests a possible link between the robust recovery of \nthe two subregions and their exports to the PRC.\n\nQuarterly export volumes to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\n\nHong Kong, China\nRep. of Korea\nPhilippines\nTaipei,China\n\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nSingapore\nThailand\n\nQ1 2008 = 100\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\nQ1\n2008\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ1\n10\n\nSource: Park and Shin (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\nbetween the PRC\u2019s imports from, for example, Malaysia \nand that country\u2019s output level. \n\nOf particular interest are the relative size of the impact \nof the PRC\u2019s imports on Malaysia\u2019s GDP and the evolution \nof this size over time. An impact that is comparable to \nthe impact of US imports would support the view of the \nemergence of a second engine of growth. Further, an \nimpact that grows over time relative to the US impact \nwould also support a twin-engine paradigm.\n\nWhen this hypothesis is tested econometrically, two key \nfindings emerge. In the short run, the PRC\u2019s imports seem \nto exert an independent, positive impact on its neighbors\u2019 \ngrowth. This impact is especially evident if we include the \nglobal crisis period. For many countries, exports to the \nPRC had a quantitatively similar impact as exports to the \nUS on their output\n\nHowever, in the long run, the positive impact of the \nPRC\u2019s imports on its neighbors\u2019 output largely reflects US \ndemand. That is, US demand for final goods is driving the \nPRC\u2019s demand for components from, say, the Republic of \nKorea. \n\nThe evidence has two interesting implications. One \n\nis that exports to the US still have a big effect on the \nperformance of East and Southeast Asian economies, \ndespite Asia\u2019s growing weight in the world economy. \nThe other is that exports to the PRC contributed to its \nneighbors\u2019 recovery from the global crisis. This provides \nsome grounds for optimism about the PRC\u2019s role as a \nsecond engine of growth.\n\nThe PRC\u2019s support for GDP growth in the rest of the \nregion involves the trade channel. If the PRC is indeed an \nengine of growth, there should be a positive relationship \n\nSource\n\nPark and Shin (forthcoming).\n\ngiant\u2019s recovery to 8.6% growth was both robust and broad-based even in \nthe face of fiscal consolidation and a substantial tightening of monetary \npolicy during the year. This helped to boost subregional growth to 7.9% in \n2010. \n\nIndia\u2019s strong growth will moderate somewhat\u20148.2% in 2011\u2014before \n\npicking up again in 2012 to 8.8%. Consequently, growth in South Asia \nis expected to dip to 7.5% in 2011 and come up again to 8.1% in 2012. Sri \nLanka\u2019s peace dividend continues to support its expansion.\n\nInflation in South Asia averaged 9.3% in 2010, much above the 4.3% \nof a year earlier when decelerating inflation generally prevailed. The high \nsubregional average is almost entirely due to high food inflation in India \nand continued double-digit inflation in Pakistan. South Asia\u2019s inflation is \nexpected to stay high at 8.7% in 2011 and ease to 7.3% in 2012, with global \nfood and oil prices the main culprits.\n\nCentral Asia\u2019s economies benefited from the higher international \ncommodity prices. Much higher prices for the subregion\u2019s key exports \n\n\f22    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\n(oil, metals, cotton, and gold) supported the recovery (6.6% \ngrowth in 2010) and will stay important drivers during the \nforecast period (Figure 1.2.5). \n\nIn Kazakhstan, the largest subregional economy, the \nrecovery was V-shaped, as growth came in at 7.0% on a \nresurgence in external demand (particularly oil) and domestic \nanticrisis measures. The non-oil economies strengthened with \neconomic revival in the Russian Federation, their main source \nof remittances, trade, and finance. Growth in all Central Asia is \nexpected to rise slightly to 6.7% in 2011 and 6.9% in 2012.\nAcross the subregion, inflation tended to accelerate \nthroughout the year, largely due to higher food prices. It \naveraged 7.1% in 2010, up from 5.9% in 2009. Subregional \ninflation is expected to accelerate further to 8.2% in 2011. Higher \nfood prices in all countries and higher energy prices in the oil \nimporters are the main instigators. Moderation in food prices in \n2012 will provide some relief, and inflation should ease to 6.6%.\nGrowth in the Pacific strengthened in 2010 (Figure 1.2.6). \n\nMost of the 5.2% growth is attributable to the resource-rich \neconomies of Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Solomon \nIslands. These economies benefited from higher global prices for \nmineral and agricultural resources, new investment, and higher \ngovernment revenue from resources. \n\nIncome from tourism and remittances generally increased as \nthe global economic performance improved. However, the solid \naggregate growth masked a marginal GDP gain in Fiji (0.1%) \nand zero to slight growth in most of the small Pacific islands. \nGrowth should reach 6.3% in 2011, due in part to the start of a \nlarge natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, before settling \nback to 5.4% in 2012.\n\nInflation\nGDP growth\n\n1.2.5  GDP growth and inflation, Central Asia\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\n2008\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\nInflation\nGDP growth\n\n1.2.6  GDP growth and inflation, the Pacific\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\n2008\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\nPacific inflation is also picking up alongside global commodity prices \nas these import-dependent countries cope with rising world food and oil \nprices. Inflation reached 5.9% in 2010 and is forecast to hit 6.5% in 2011, \nbefore falling back to 5.6% in 2012.\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s overall current account surplus is \nfalling\u2014from 4.7% of GDP in 2009 to 4.1% in 2010\u2014and is \nprojected to decline further (Figure 1.2.7). Rising commodity \nprices, especially for oil, and the region\u2019s strong GDP growth \nare raising its imports. Under the forecasts for even higher oil \nprices with continued strong growth, the balance is projected to \nfall further to 3.3% of GDP in 2011 and 3.0% in 2012. \n\nIt would, however, be premature to interpret this movement \nas an unwinding of the global current account imbalances that \npersisted before the crisis. Lasting rebalancing will require \nkey structural changes in both the current account surplus \ncountries in the region and the US.\n\nThe region is forecast to continue its strong growth in the \ncoming years, with the rate moderating to a more sustainable \npace.

The unfolding effects of the Japanese \nearthquake and tsunami will also need to be monitored carefully \n(Box 1.2.2).\n\nContinued slow industrial-country expansion\n\nThe downside risks to the global outlook apply as well to developing Asia. \nWhile the region has supported industrial-country recovery, it is not clear \nhow well its own growth would hold up if faced with prolonged sluggish \ngrowth in advanced economies. As will be discussed in Part 2, South\u2013\nSouth Economic Links, expanding economic ties outside the region\u2019s \ntraditional markets will be important to sustain future growth and global \nstability, but this shift will not come easily. In the short run, developing \nAsia\u2019s fortunes are still linked with those of the US, eurozone, and Japan.\n\nUncertain regional impacts from the Japanese disaster\n\nThe massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on 11 March 2011 pose \na risk, too, especially if production disruptions persist for some time. In \naddition to the effect on exports in the short term, extended disruptions \nwould affect the regional production networks. The region is also closely \ntied to Japan through foreign direct investment and other financial flows. \n\nBuilding inflation pressures\n\nHigher international oil and food prices are posing a risk for global \ngrowth generally. Developing Asia, as a net importer of commodities, \ncould see the recent price surges undermine its performance, too.\n\nFuel enters the household consumption basket directly, but oil is also \na critical factor of production. Rising oil prices push up production costs \nand hence overall price levels. In contrast, food price effects are limited \nto the direct effects, but they also account for a large share of household \nspending in the region (Table 1.2.1). For example, the share of food is \naround 30% in the PRC and over 45% in India. \n\nModel simulations show that a 30% increase in both oil and food \n\nprices over their 2010 levels can depress the region\u2019s growth by 0.7 \npercentage points and can add 1.7 percentage points to its inflation rate \n(Box 1.2.3). The macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks tend to be \nbigger because of their indirect effects through higher input costs.\n\nAs production levels return to their potential, internal price pressures \n\ncould add to the effects of the external price shocks. Although still \nmanageable, inflation is trending upward, and some economies are \nshowing signs of overheating. Capital inflows from industrial countries, \nwhere the monetary stance remains loose, may add further price \npressures. As the recovery firms, policy makers may need to put a higher \npriority on containing inflation. \n\nAsia in the uneven global recovery     23\n\nTable 1.2.1  Food weights in consumer \nprice index baskets\n\nEconomy\n\nShare (%)\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nBangladesh\nPhilippines\n\nIndia\nSri Lanka\nCambodiaa\nPakistan b\nViet Nam\nIndonesia c\nThailand a\nMalaysia a\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of b\nHong Kong, China\nTaipei,China\nSingapore a\nKorea, Rep. of a\n\nMajor industrial economies\nJapan b\nUnited States b\n\nEurozone\n\na  Includes nonalcoholic beverages.  b  Includes \nbeverages.  c  Includes beverages and tobacco.\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 1 March \n2011); National statistics websites.\n\n58.84\n46.58\n\n46.19\n45.50\n44.78\n40.34\n39.93\n\n36.20\n33.01\n31.40\n30.20\n26.67\n26.08\n\n22.05\n14.04\n\n25.90\n\n14.80\n\n14.00\n\n\f24    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\n1.2.2  Tohoku disaster: Effect on developing Asia\u2019s economies\n\nJapan is the world\u2019s third-largest national economy, and the \nrecent earthquake and tsunami are bound to reverberate on \nthe global and Asian economies through various channels.\nThe main mechanism will be trade. The earthquake will \ntrigger a short-term decline in the exports of Japan\u2019s major \ntrading partners. Japan accounts for a significant share of \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s trade (Box figure 1), especially East and \nSoutheast Asia.\n\n1  Share of Japan in exports and imports, 2009\n\nExports\n\nImports\n\n%\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nPRC\n\nHKG\n\nIND\n\nINO\n\nKOR\n\nMAL\n\nPHI\n\nSIN\n\nTAP\n\nTHA\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Rep. of China; HKG = Hong Kong, China; \nIND = India; INO = Indonesia; KOR = Rep. of Korea; \nMAL = Malaysia; PHI = Philippines; SIN = Singapore; \nTAP = Taipei,China; THA = Thailand.\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2011. Direction \nof Trade Statistics. February; CEIC Data Company (both \naccessed 21 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nIn trade, since Japan plays an important role in global supply \n\nchains and regional production networks, short-run regional \nand global production may be disrupted. As production of \nsemiconductors, auto parts, and optical lens is suspended in \nthe quake-hit Tohoku region, concern about a shortage of \nsupply is growing within and outside Asia. Such disruptions \nare especially significant for East and Southeast Asia, which are \ntightly integrated with Japan in regional production networks. \nThis production network linkage is why, for example, the PRC \nruns a large and persistent trade deficit with Japan.\n\nBeyond the short run, the impact on trade will be mixed \nand differ for different products and different countries. For \nexample, imports of reconstruction materials and energy \nproducts will rise.\n\nFinance is another important channel, as Japan is a major \n\nexporter of capital and a significant source of foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) for countries in the region (and beyond). \nAgain, because of the production network links, Japanese \ninvestment is particularly notable in East and Southeast Asia \n(Box figure 2).

It \nimports, for example, around 4.3 million barrels of oil a day. \nUnsurprisingly, some commodity indexes initially fell heavily \nafter news of the earthquake, though the impact on most \ncommodity prices will wear off quickly. \n\nWhere there may be some lingering effects is in energy \nmarkets. The unfolding nuclear crisis may raise worldwide \nconcerns about the safety of nuclear energy, and may benefit \nenergy exporters such as Kazakhstan and Timor-Leste if those \nconcerns lead to a medium-term shift in the global energy mix.\nOther transmission channels include tourism from Japan \nand remittances of those foreign workers likely to be affected \nin the very short term. But the overall negative impact on \ndeveloping Asia is likely to be limited in both magnitude and \nduration, and concentrated in East and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe disaster shows that even well-prepared advanced \neconomies find it difficult to cope with natural shocks, and \nthus the need to be well prepared. This is even more urgent for \ndeveloping Asia, which accounted for 61% of global fatalities \nand 90% of all people affected by natural disasters in 1970\u2013\n2008. Developing countries are of course more vulnerable to \nnatural disasters because of weaker infrastructure and lack of \nanticipatory measures.\n\nIn developing Asia, earthquakes are the single most \ndestructive disaster, accounting for just over 420,000 deaths \nand $156 billion in damage in 2000\u20132010 (Box table).\n\nA wide range of policies are available for developing Asia \nto reduce its vulnerability.

The \nsimulations help to quantify the short-run effects of changes in \nmacroeconomic variables. \n\nThe model assumes that the region\u2019s monetary authorities \nwill gradually tighten monetary policy over the next 2 years in \nresponse to the inflation impact of higher oil and food prices. \nMonetary adjustment is motivated by inflation concerns, but \nit will have a negative effect on private demand, especially \ninvestment, and hence growth. \n\nTo trace the potential impact of the rise in global oil and \nfood prices on developing Asia in 2011 and 2012, the following \nscenarios were run. To simulate effects of international price \nspikes, global oil prices were increased temporarily by 30% in \n2011 (from the 2010 level) and then allowed to fall back by 3% \nin 2012. This would correspond to a scenario where market \nfears about Middle Eastern supply subside as the Libyan civil \nconflict moves toward some sort of resolution. \n\nSimilarly, global food prices were increased temporarily by \n30% in 2011 (from the 2010 level) and then reduced by 5% in \n2012. This corresponds to a scenario where temporary weather-\nrelated production shortfalls are the immediate catalyst of the \nprice surge.\n\nThe two shocks are examined separately, and as a joint shock. \n\nThere is some relationship between oil and food prices: higher \noil prices raise production costs, such as fertilizers, irrigation, \nand transport. The effects of the shocks are compared with the \nbaseline of oil and food prices remaining at their 2010 levels. \n\nThe model simulations show that oil and food price shocks \ncould dent developing Asia\u2019s growth but do not derail the robust \nmomentum of its recovery. An oil price shock has a visibly \nbigger effect. This is plausible since the region\u2019s dependence \non imported oil is substantially higher than its dependence on \nimported food. An oil price shock cuts the region\u2019s growth by \n0.5 percentage points in 2011 and 0.7 percentage points in 2012. \n\nThe impact of the food price shock retards the region\u2019s \ngrowth by 0.1 percentage points in 2011 and 0.2 percentage \npoints in 2012. \n\nPredictably, combining the oil and food price shocks \n\nmagnifies their impacts. Together they knock off 0.7 percentage \npoints and 0.8 percentage points from growth (Box figure 1). \nSingapore and the Philippines will be most adversely affected in \n2011, India and Malaysia in 2012. \n\nOil and food price shocks add substantially to the region\u2019s \n\ninflation in the short run.

This is \ntrue for both inflation and, particularly, growth. Such results \nstem from the region\u2019s greater dependence on imports for \noil than for food. Also, the two shocks would have a bigger \neffect on inflation than on GDP growth. In light of the region\u2019s \nrobust recovery in 2012 and incipient inflation pressures, the \nresults further strengthen the case for stepping up vigilance on \ninflation.\n\n1.

Figures 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 \ndisplay year-on-year aggregate consumer price inflation in 11 \ndeveloping Asian economies in the last 5 years. In virtually all \ncases, inflation since the global crisis is back on a rising trend, \nand is comparable to its precrisis rate.\n\nAt this stage, inflation in Asia may not yet be a serious \nproblem, though it may become one. Growing uncertainties \nfrom tensions in the Middle East as well as the recent natural \ndisaster in Japan and its consequent nuclear disruption raise \nthe risks for higher prices of oil and commodities. This \ntendency intensifies pressures for further inflation hikes in \nAsia, requiring policy makers to pay greater attention to it. If inflation \nis allowed to accelerate further, it could threaten to derail growth in the \nregion.\n\nJan\n2006\n\nWhy inflation matters for developing Asia\nOne reason why the region should now focus on inflation is the impact \nof rising global commodity prices on domestic prices. The oil price surge \nis a global external shock, largely beyond Asia\u2019s control. Soaring global \noil prices often lead to higher domestic retail fuel prices, and broadly to \nhigher production costs and overall prices. \n\nThe impact of higher global food prices on overall domestic \nprices can be substantial since food accounts for a large share of \nAsia\u2019s consumption basket (Table 1.2.1 above). In some countries, \nfood accounts for at least 30% of the consumer price index. \nFood price inflation in these countries has reached double-digit \nlevels in recent months, driving up general inflation.\n\nA key factor why inflation should be a main priority for the \n\nregion\u2019s policy makers is its impact on poverty and inequality. \nIn the case of high food prices, the poor are especially \nvulnerable since they spend a large portion of their income on \nfood. Inflation, especially food price inflation, can push those \nwho subsist within the margins or just above the poverty line \ninto poverty. Recent estimates indicate that a 10% increase in \ndomestic food prices would raise the number of poor in developing Asia \nby about 65 million, a 7.2% increase in the number of poor (Box 1.3.1). \nHeightened inflation can thus dilute the region\u2019s hard-won gains in \npoverty reduction.\n\nJan\n2006\n\nBy disproportionately harming the poor, inflation not only worsens \npoverty but can exacerbate inequality (Easterly and Fischer, 2001; Romer \nand Romer, 1998). Unlike the rich or the nonpoor, those living in poverty \ntypically lack the financial assets and human capital that can protect \nthem against the effects of inflation.

According to ADB (2011), about one-third \nof an increase in global food prices is transmitted to local \nfood prices in the region. This means that the recent 30% or \nso rise in global prices will raise local prices by about 10%. \nThe same study estimates that a 10% rise in domestic \nfood prices in developing Asia risks creating an additional \n64 million people living on less than $1.25 per day, or \npushing up the percentage of poor by about 2 points \n(Box table). The impact is even larger for a 20% and 30% \nincrease in local food prices. Quite clearly, the impact of \nhigher food prices on the region\u2019s poverty is substantial.\n\nGiven the growing frequency with which global food price \n\nshocks are hitting the region, policy makers should pursue \nshort- and long-term policy responses to strengthen their \nfood and energy security. A wide range of policies would \nbetter prepare developing Asia for a world of high and volatile \nglobal commodity prices. \n\nIn addition to domestic policy responses such as \npromoting agricultural investment and improving the \ndomestic food supply chain, collective action can lessen \n\nImpact of domestic food price increase on poverty for \ndeveloping Asia\n\nPoverty before \nprice increase\n\nPoverty after food \nprices increase by:\n\nProportion of poor (%)\nNumber of poor (million)\nChange in number of poor (%)\n\n27.1\n903\n\n10% 20% 30%\n\n29.0\n968\n7.2\n\n30.9\n1,032\n14.3\n\n32.9\n1,097\n21.4\n\nNotes: Calculations are based on a $1.25-a-day poverty line.

National, regional, and global policy responses \nand coordination will help the region better cope with the \nimpact of food price surges and volatility.\n\nSource\n\nADB (2011). \n\ntheir income is spent on food, rising food prices mean they will have less \nfor spending on other essentials. This limits their opportunities to engage \nin more productive activities. By narrowing economic opportunities, \nespecially among the poor, inflation can undermine efforts to promote \ninclusive growth, which spreads the benefits of growth to the broader \npopulation.\n\nHigh inflation is a direct threat to stable and inclusive growth since \nrising domestic prices can lead to social tensions. Indeed, rapidly soaring \ndomestic prices have triggered social unrest in a raft of countries. For \nexample, in 2008 rising soybean prices triggered riots in Indonesia and \nsoaring rice prices in Bangladesh sparked large protests. More recently, \nin December 2010, India was hit by riots over high onion prices. Outside \nAsia, escalating food prices led to riots in Algeria and Tunisia.\n\nIn the case of the PRC, policy makers recognize high inflation as a \nrisk to building a \u201charmonious society,\u201d a strategic policy shift geared \ntoward spreading the benefits of economic development to maintain \nsocial harmony and stability. The authorities are pushing for more \ninclusive growth against the backdrop of inflation pressures and growing \nsocial problems. Since inflation is a major issue, the country\u2019s Economic \nand Social Development Plan for 2011 will focus on maintaining stable \nprices.\n\nLooking ahead, there is a growing risk that nominal wage inflation \nwill cause a wage\u2013price spiral in developing Asia. The process may begin \nwith workers demanding higher nominal wages to maintain or increase \ntheir real wages in the face of higher prices, which eventually forces firms \nto increase prices to protect their profit margins. A major cyclical driver \nof nominal wage increases is strong aggregate demand due to the region\u2019s \n\n\f28    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nrobust and speedy recovery. A more structural factor is that \ndeveloping Asia, labor abundant until now, may be reaching the \nend of surplus labor. \n\nSurplus labor enables economies to maintain wages at \nrelatively low and stable levels. As the surplus labor dissipates, \nhowever, developing Asia will have to grapple with rising wage \npressures. The shift in Asia\u2019s demographic pattern from high to \nlow fertility rates and population growth point to a gradual loss \nin surplus labor. Such a shift has led to a decline in the growth \nof the working-age population (Figure 1.3.3). \n\nIn the case of the PRC, the turning point is set to arrive \nafter 2015. Between the mid-1980s and the late 1990s, about \n30%\u201340% of the country\u2019s agricultural workers were considered \nsurplus labor. Given demographic shifts and transfer of labor \nfrom agriculture to nonagriculture and from rural to urban \nareas, surplus labor has significantly declined (Cai, 2011). This \ndecline, along with strong demand due to high economic \ngrowth, has increased the pressure for higher wages. Indeed, \ntrends in 2000\u20132008 indicate fast-rising nominal wages in the \nPRC, averaging about 15% a year (Figure 1.3.4). \n\nOn the demand side, robust economic growth throughout \nAsia in 2010 seems to have pushed aggregate demand to catch \nup with, if not exceed, its potential output level by the start \nof 2011. The output gap has recently been positive in many \ncountries, and is increasingly so (Figures 1.3.5 and 1.3.6). This \nsuggests that countries have fully recovered from the recent \ncrisis and are back to prior modes of operation with all their \nchallenges, including labor market tightness (which could push \nwages higher) and domestic inflation pressures.\n\nAs demand pressures are already in play in most Asian \neconomies, normal monetary policy operations are back. Given \nthe mixed nature of Asia\u2019s recent inflation pressures, however, \nrelying solely on monetary policy to curb inflation may have \nlimitations since it will not be very effective to control cost-push \ninflation. \n\nMonetary policy needs to react appropriately to inflation \npressures in the region as it manages not only current inflation \nbut also its expectations. If current inflation pushes up \nexpectations, monetary policy should move immediately, but \nappropriately. This shift is required to signal that the monetary \nauthorities will not be easy on future inflation. The move also \nhas to be credible, and so has to be based on its likely impact on \nthe economy in general. \n\nPolicy responses\nTo cope with international commodity price rises, most Asian \neconomies have shown greater willingness to let their currencies \nappreciate, particularly after June 2010 (Figure 1.3.7). \n\nIn addition, authorities around the region have imposed \n\ntariff-relief measures to reduce the burden on prices for \n\n1.3.3  Working-age population growth \n\nPeople's Rep. of China\nIndonesia\nPhilippines\n\nHong Kong, China\nRep. of Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nTaipei,China\n\nIndia\nMalaysia\nThailand\n\n1970\u221279\n\n1980\u221289\n\n1990\u221299\n\n2000\u221209\n\nNote: Refers to ages 15\u201364.\n500\nSources: CEIC Data Company; World Bank.

The success of these measures, however, \nvaries by country. For example, domestic food price inflation \nstill dominates consumer price inflation in Indonesia and the \nRepublic of Korea, but not the Philippines.\n\nWith food inflation in some countries still high, even after \n\ncurrency appreciation and tariff reductions, there may also \nbe domestic factors propping up the price of food. Therefore, \ndealing with high domestic food inflation by addressing the \nexternal problems may not be enough. Resolving domestic \nhindrances like problems in the domestic supply chain and \ninfrastructure shortfalls may also be required.\n\nResponding to the stronger than expected recovery and \nrecent inflation trends, emerging markets around Asia have \nstarted their monetary tightening cycle, with gradual increases \nin their benchmark interest rates, though at different speeds \n(Figure 1.3.8). Viet Nam, India, and Malaysia were among \nthe first, in the first half of 2010, while Indonesia and the \nPhilippines kept their benchmark rate unchanged, with \nIndonesia beginning to lift it only in February 2011 and the \nPhilippines in March, pointing to a varied sense of urgency \namong monetary authorities.\n\nCountries have also taken other tightening measures to \n\nmanage the growth in aggregate liquidity that was partly \nattributable to the remnants of the massive liquidity expansion \nduring the crisis. The PRC, India, and Indonesia, for example, \nraised their reserve requirements in 2010 to absorb the liquidity \neffect of expansionary monetary policy during the crisis. \nMalaysia and Viet Nam have also indicated their intention to \nfollow suit in 2011 as a preemptive measure to contain excessive \nbuildup of liquidity in the domestic financial system.\n\nThe task of managing high levels of liquidity in Asia is \ncomplicated by a strong domestic credit expansion following \nthe region\u2019s rapid recovery, and huge net private capital inflows chasing \nhigher returns in a region with stronger economic fundamentals and \n\nTable 1.3.1  Actions taken in response to soaring international food prices\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nTariff on flour cut from 4.2% to 2.5% (January\u2013June 2011)\n\nCountry\n\nIndonesia\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSource: ADB staff compilation.\n\nResponse to food price increases\n\nDuties suspended on food-related items: products and materials, raw materials for animal feed and \n\nfertilizers (24 January\u201331 December 2011)\n\nTariffs on corn, soymeal, and 32 other items to be reduced from 1% to 0% (March\u2013December 2011)\n\nTariff-free import limit for pork raised from 50,000 tonnes to 110,000 tonnes; for powdered milk raised from \n\n21,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes (started February 2011, no specific duration)\n\nExports of onions via land banned\n\nTariff lifted on refined sugar; zero tariff on milling wheat (29 January\u201331 December 2010)\n\nTariff on milk powder cut (amount not specified; beginning 24 January 2011)\n\n\f30    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nmore favorable monetary settings than most of the rest of the world. \nSome countries have therefore imposed limited and targeted capital \ncontrols to reduce inflows of short-term capital (Table 1.3.2).\n\nTable 1.3.2  Selected capital control measures in developing Asia\n\nInstrument\n\nStrengths\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRecent examples\n\nTax measures\n\nTargeted measures can be \nmore easily calibrated to \nsize of risks\n\nCalibration can be difficult in \n\npractice\n\nKorea, Rep. of: Reimposition of 14% withholding and 20% capital \ngains taxes on foreign purchases of government bonds (18 \nNovember 2010)\n\nThailand: 15% tax on interest income and capital gains earned \n\nby foreign investors (12 October 2010)\n\nMinimum \n\ninvestment \nperiods\n\nIncrease incentives to invest \n\nReduce but do not eliminate \n\nIndonesia: 1-month minimum holding period for central bank \n\nin longer-term assets\n\nthe flow\n\nmoney market certificates (16 June 2010)\n\nQuantitative limits\n\nCountries can directly \n\ncontrol how much capital \nis let in\n\nAllocation and monitoring of \nallowance can be difficult\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of: Limits on Hong Kong, China banks' \n\nnet open positions and ability to access yuan through the \nmainland\u2019s foreign exchange market (3 January 2011)\n\nIndonesia: Short-term external bank borrowing limited to 30% of \n\ncapital (29 December 2010)\n\nKorea, Rep. of: Cap on banks\u2019 foreign exchange derivatives books \n\n(20 December 2010)\n\nSource: Institute of International Finance (2011).\n\nFigure 1.3.9 illustrates the amount of capital flows in eight developing \n\nAsian economies. Net inflows have been high since the second half of \n2009 largely because since the crisis, most of Asia has been performing \nbetter than industrial economies, promoting greater returns \ndifferentials. Highly expansionary monetary policy stances \nin industrial economies, particularly quantitative easing in \nthe US, has also supported the flow of capital to the region as \nsome of the resultant liquidity is finding its way into emerging \neconomies (Box 1.3.2).\n\nMore liquidity can, of course, buttress economic activity. \nToo much, however, can be damaging, tending to overheat an \neconomy as it pushes demand ahead of what the economy can \npotentially supply. Unless managed appropriately, overabundant \nliquidity can destabilize an economy, and render a country\u2019s \nfinance sector more vulnerable to a crisis. \n\nThe issue becomes thornier if some of the liquidity comes \n\nfrom short-term external flows, which can be volatile. This \ncomponent has been quite significant in the composition \nof recent capital inflows to Asia. Figure 1.3.9 suggests that \nnet inflows, in the form of portfolio and other flows through banking \nchannels, have dominated the net influx of capital in the last 2 years. Not \nonly are they potentially destabilizing for Asia\u2019s finance sector in general, \nbut they can also contribute to speculative asset bubbles and inflation.\n\n1.3.9  Net capital flows, emerging Asia\nPortfolio\n\nForeign direct investment\n\nOthers\n\n$ billion\n225\n\n150\n\n75\n\n0\n\n- 75\n\n- 150\n\nH1\n2007\n\nH2\n\nH1\n08\n\nH2\n\nH1\n09\n\nH2\n\nH1\n10\n\nNote: Based on data for People\u2019s Rep. of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; \nRep. of Korea; Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand.\nSource: ADB estimates based on data from CEIC Data Company (accessed 22 \nMarch 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fAsia in the uneven global recovery     31\n\n1.3.2 Impact of quantitative easing in the United States on Asia\n\nThe adoption of quantitative easing by the United States \n(US) Federal Reserve in early 2009 aroused widespread \nconcern in Asia and elsewhere over its possible impact on \nweakening the US dollar and stimulating capital outflows \nto emerging economies and possibly stimulating inflation \npressures.\n\nQuantitative easing consists in the Federal Reserve\u2019s \n\ntwo major programs of outright purchases of US \nTreasury notes and bonds, as part of its Large-scale Asset \nPurchases program, which includes agency securities and \nmortgage-backed securities. The first block of purchases of \n$300 billion of Treasury coupon securities was announced \non 18 March 2009 and the first operation was conducted \na week later. Purchases continued at a pace of about \n$10 billion a week over the subsequent 5 months, and then \nslowed through the end of October. \n\nThe second tranche of purchases of $600 billion of \nTreasuries was announced on 3 November 2010, and is \nexpected to be completed by end-June 2011.\n\nHow did US capital outflows react during this period? \n\nThe box figure shows that US gross outward portfolio \ninvestment in April\u2013September 2009 returned to a large \noutflow of $280 billion, about double the quarterly \nrate of January\u2013March of $73 billion, and a reversal of \nlarge withdrawals of capital the previous year. Other \n\nprivate assets showed a smaller outflow of $24 billion. \nThis suggests that the liquidity created by the purchase \noperations leaked overseas.\n\nPrivate gross capital outflows, United States\n\nDirect investment \nPortfolio investment \nOther assets\n\n$ billion\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n-200\n\n-400\n\nSep\n\nMar\n2008\n\nMar\n09\n\nSep\n\nSep\n\nMar\n10\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 22 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nThe latest episode of increased US capital outflows \ncorresponds to the return of high net inflows in Asia in \nthe second half of 2009. \n\nAlthough it is difficult to disentangle these flows from \n\nthe general increase in economic optimism at the time, \nat least part of the leakage from quantitative easing does \nseem to have been channeled through to Asia.\n\nPolicy consistency and the dilemma for Asian \npolicy makers\n\nManaging current inflation pressures is not easy for Asian policy makers. \nIncreasing benchmark policy rates to fend off potential demand pressures \non inflation would prompt wider interest rate differentials between \nAsia and industrial nations, hence potentially attracting further volatile \ncapital inflows. Such inflows would compound the difficulties of handling \ndomestic demand pressures by creating greater liquidity in the system. \nThey would also increase risk of capital reversals that could destabilize \nthe finance sector. \n\nThe large inflows of capital to Asia will also increase pressure for \nAsian currencies to appreciate. Allowing the exchange rate to adjust \nwould cushion the economy from the effects of excessive capital inflows. \nIn fact, greater exchange rate flexibility is a sustainable response to \na permanent increase in capital inflows by inducing a fundamental \nrevaluation of domestic assets relative to foreign assets. Such flexibility \nintroduces two-way risks for investors, hence potentially discouraging \nspeculative capital inflows. Appreciation also helps fend off inflation \npressures from increases in international commodity prices by keeping \nthe local currency price of these goods down.\n\nAppreciating their currency, however, may not appeal to policy \n\n\f32    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nmakers who are concerned about the impact it would have on their export \nsector, particularly as the resurgence in exports supported the rapid pace \nof economic recovery in Asia. A unilateral currency appreciation is often \nundesirable since it hurts the export sector immediately by reducing the \neconomy\u2019s international price competitiveness.\n\nAvoiding appreciation in these circumstances requires policy makers \nto intervene in foreign exchange markets, but this raises two immediate \nissues. First, continued interventions could trigger a \u201ccurrency war,\u201d as \ncountries strive to maintain low exchange rates vis-\u00e0-vis their neighbors. \nSecond, interventions to avoid appreciation could be self-defeating. \n\nThey will have an expansionary effect on domestic liquidity, hence \nfurther increase domestic inflation pressures, which would also damage \ninternational competitiveness in the longer run through real exchange \nrate appreciation. \n\nOf course, the authorities may attempt to sterilize the expansionary \ndomestic liquidity effects by reducing the domestic credit component of \ntheir monetary base. Such sterilization is, however, often only effective \nin the short run, difficult to execute, and costly to implement. Foreign \nexchange intervention against nominal appreciation therefore should not \nbe a first-recourse option. \n\nThe nature of capital inflows is also a reason that Asian policy makers \n\nmay hold back from relying only on exchange rate appreciation to deal \nwith current inflows. Exchange rate flexibility may be an effective tool \nagainst a sustained surge of capital inflows. But using only this approach \nif the inflows are temporary may involve side effects to the economy. \nAs the flow of capital reverses, the exchange rate will need to adjust to \nthe opposite direction. With temporary capital flows, this implies high-\nfrequency currency fluctuations, creating more problems since they tend \nto invite more speculative attacks. \n\nImposing selective and carefully designed temporary capital control \n\nmeasures on inflows may therefore be an option. With such measures \nin place, emerging Asian economies may gain room for managing their \ndomestic inflation without exerting too much pressure on exchange rate \nappreciation. The effectiveness of capital control measures themselves, \nhowever, is debatable. Not only do they require a high degree of \nadministrative capacity to implement, but they also should be exercised \ntemporarily, as they tend to lose their effectiveness over time (Kawai and \nTakagi, 2008).\n\nThe above discussions provide possible policy responses to dealing \nwith the problem of large capital inflows that is accompanying the quest \nto curb inflation pressures in Asia. Once a country can identify whether \nits influx of capital is permanent or temporary, it can take appropriate \nsteps more easily. Unfortunately, such identification is difficult, so \ncountries will have to decide on the nature of the problem while taking \nthe necessary actions. \n\nPossible solutions\nThe appropriate policy response for dealing with capital inflows therefore \ndiffers by the specific nature of the problem. The state of a country\u2019s \ncurrent account imbalances and the alignment of its exchange rate with \n\n\fAsia in the uneven global recovery     33\n\nrespect to its economic fundamentals offer a guideline for determining \nthe appropriate steps.\n\nLetting the exchange rate move more flexibly to avoid further \ndisruptive capital inflows may be a better policy for countries that have \nundergone persistent current account imbalances and misalignment \nbetween the exchange rate and fundamentals. It may help these countries \nto realign the exchange rate to be more in line with fundamentals, \nhence promoting sustainable economic growth and stability. In contrast, \ncountries without such symptoms may be better relying more on \ntemporary policies, such as capital controls, that fend off excessive capital \ninflows. This policy, however, should not be used permanently as it will be \nunsustainable over the long run.\n\nHow to measure the extent to which a country falls under each \ncategory is complicated. It is also politically sensitive. No commonly \nagreed measures or guidelines have been developed. This highlights the \nneed for countries to coordinate setting their policies, particularly when \nthey deal with potentially disruptive capital flows. Any unilateral act to \nlet the currency move more flexibly, or even to impose capital controls, \ncan result in an unfavorable situation for the country taking that step, \nhence potentially leading to some kind of \u201cprisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d type of \nsolution.\n\nFortunately, G20 members have recently started efforts to work \non introducing indicative guidelines that can be used to assess a set \nof indicators, including a country\u2019s current account imbalance by \nconsidering exchange rate and other macroeconomic policies and \nindicators. Such guidelines will be useful for differentiating countries. \nThe guidelines will promote adoption of more appropriate policy by \ncountries dealing with capital flows in a more coordinated manner, hence \npotentially being more effective. Asia has many lessons to offer that would \nbe useful in introducing these practical guidelines.\n\nRising inflation pressures coupled with potentially destabilizing \ncapital inflows is an immediate challenge facing policy makers in the \nregion. Another issue, though, is how to maintain regional growth in \nlight of expected sluggishness in the major industrial countries. Looking \nto other developing-country markets may be promising.\n\n\f34    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nSolid rebound in the non-Asian \ndeveloping world\n\nThe world economy is in the midst of a two-speed recovery from the \nrecent global crisis\u2014a recovery in which developing countries are rapidly \nrebounding while industrial countries are still struggling to find their \nfeet. The earlier analysis looked closely at developing Asia, but what about \nAfrica, Latin America, and the Middle East?\n\nIn Africa, growth declined from an average of 5.8% in \n2004\u20132008 to 2.7% in 2009 but bounced back to 4.7% in 2010. \nLatin America suffered a 1.8% contraction of output in 2009, \nfrom an average of 5.1% in 2004\u20132008. The region rebounded \nsharply, however, growing by 5.7% in 2010. In the Middle East, \ngrowth fell sharply from an average of 5.2% in 2004\u20132008 \nto 2.1% in 2009 but recovered strongly to 4.1% in 2010. The \npattern of crisis and recovery is broadly similar across the three \nregions\u2014a sharp deceleration followed by a robust upturn\u2014and \nto that of developing Asia (Figure 1.4.1).\n\nThere have been a number of common factors behind the \n\nrelatively quick recovery of Africa, Latin America, and the \nMiddle East. Above all was the turnaround in the external \nenvironment and normalization of global trade. In particular, \nthe sharp rebound in global commodity prices benefited all three \nregions since many countries in the non-Asian developing world are \nmajor commodity exporters. Another common driver of the recovery \nhas been accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, which supported \ndemand and growth. In some countries, an improved policy environment \nfacilitated the stimulus. For example, many Latin American countries \nhave pursued more prudent fiscal and monetary policies since the late \n1980s.\n\nAt the same time, there were a number of differences across the three \n\nregions. For example, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East differ \nsubstantially in the level of their integration into the global \nfinancial system. This explains why the national financial systems \nof Africa suffered relatively little damage from the crisis, and \nthe region\u2019s financial markets continued to function. In contrast, \nthe crisis had a major impact on the financial stability of Latin \nAmerica due to its high degree of integration into that system. \nThis helps to explain why the region\u2019s output contracted in 2009. \nDespite such differences, the non-Asian developing world \nhas by and large recovered swiftly and robustly from the global \ncrisis. Developing Asia leads the global recovery but the South \nas a whole has outperformed the North since the start of the \ncrisis and is projected to continue to do so in the near future \n(Figure 1.4.2).\n\nThe South has fared better during the crisis primarily because \nthe nature of the crisis was fundamentally different for the two blocs. \n\n1.4.1  Average GDP growth \n2009\u22122010\n\n2004\u22122008\n\nAfrica\n\nLatin\nAmerica\n\nMiddle\nEast \nSource: ADB calculations based on data from International Monetary Fund.

These typically have lingering \nadverse effects. Past experience suggests (IMF, 2009) that recessions \ncaused by financial crises tend to be more severe and protracted than \ncrises arising from other shocks.2 At the same time, recovery from \nfinancial crisis\u2013related recessions tends to be slower because private \nconsumption and investment remain depressed longer as firms and \nhouseholds deleverage and rebuild their balance sheets.\n\nIn contrast, the crisis for the South was largely an external trade \nshock with only temporary effects, primarily on the real economy. For \nsuch a shock, the economy gets back on its feet as soon as external \ndemand recovers. This helps to explain why the South has roared back \nas global trade revived along with the recovery of the world economy. In \nshort, the asymmetric North\u2013South recovery is in part a consequence of \nthe asymmetric nature of the global crisis\u2014financial (North) and trade \n(South).\n\nThe South\u2019s limited financial links with the North and its consequent \n\nrelative immunity to the financial contagion was, however, largely the \nconsequence of its own financial underdevelopment. While this protected \nthe South by chance this time around, it carries serious risks of its own, \nas evident in the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Underdeveloped \ncapital markets may also hinder the allocation of capital to its most \nefficient uses, thus inhibiting long-run growth. More generally, the South \nfaces some serious challenges and risks to its own growth, even in the \nshort term, and its continued robust growth is far from guaranteed.\nBut even with such risks and challenges, the South on balance is \nbetter positioned than the North to sustain growth in the short run for \nthe reasons outlined above. Long-term structural factors such as the law \nof diminishing marginal returns to capital and technological catch-up \nalso strongly favor the South, which still remains far poorer than the \nNorth. \n\nStill, there is nothing automatic about the process: developing Asia \nmust continue pursuing closer trade, investment, and other economic \nlinks with other parts of the South, an issue examined in Part 2. The \nfact that the non-Asian developing world\u2019s improved performance in \nrecent years is partly due to stronger fundamentals and policies further \nreinforces the case for seeking closer ties.\n\nWhile those links are underdeveloped at present, the global \ncrisis highlighted the large potential for mutual benefit. For example, \ndeveloping Asia (including the PRC) is likely to have been a major \nsource of growth in global demand for commodities, a key export for the \nnon-Asian developing world. Broader and deeper South\u2013South links will \nnot only benefit the South, but also the North and the world economy by \nstrengthening the South. \n\n\f36    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nEndnotes\n1 This section is based on ADB (2011).\n\nand Reinhart (1999).\n\n2  The definition of a financial crisis is based on Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Kaminsky \n\nReferences\nAsian Development Bank (ADB). 2011.

And \neven in 2009, a yawning gap in living standards remained: the combined \nper capita GDP of economies in the South\u2014in purchasing power parity \ncurrent\tinternational\tdollars\u2014at\t$5,573,\twas\tnot\teven\ta\tfifth\tof\tthe\tNorth\u2019s\t\n$31,660.\n\nOver the last three decades, however, the South has been gaining \neconomic weight. Growing at an average annual rate of 4.8% during this \nperiod, by 2010 the combined economic output of the South \naccounted for 45% of world GDP, a remarkable achievement \nparticularly when seen that, as late as 1980, the rest of the \nworld\u2019s share was 71% (Figure 2.1.1). \n\nMoreover, given its relatively higher population growth \nrates and rising average incomes, the South offers tremendous \npotential markets for trade and capital investment. As trade and \nnontrade barriers of Southern economies come down further, \nincreased competition is likely to translate into efficiency \ngains in production, and expanded markets are likely to \npresent opportunities for greater specialization to achieve scale \neconomies in companies\u2019 operations\u2014both of which will benefit \nconsumers (in terms of lower prices and access to a wider range \nof goods and services). \n\nAs capital restrictions are relaxed, greater capital investment \nflows with their concomitant technology transfers and spillover \neffects are likely to translate into higher productivity and more \njob opportunities for workers, holding the promise of lifting \nmillions of people out of poverty. As financial markets deepen, \n\nThis chapter was written by Shikha Jha, Benno Ferrarini, and Akiko Terada-Hagiwara \nof the Economics and Research Department, ADB, Manila.

Moreover, in the \naftermath of the global financial crisis, Southern economies \nhave added incentives to enhance mutual economic welfare by \ndiversifying economic and institutional links.\n\nIndeed, given the prolonged slowdown in industrial \ncountries of the North, the onus for taking global growth \nforward has fallen on the South (Figure 2.1.2). After all, the \nvibrant developing Asian region has been quick to recover \nfrom the crisis, with the emerging economies of Africa and the \nMiddle East not far behind.2 And despite being hit hard due \nto its strong links with industrial economies, Latin America \nweathered the crisis well and has recovered strongly.\n\nThe need for developing Asia to look South\nDeveloping Asia has been instrumental in the rise of the South. Between \n1980 and 2010, the region grew at an average annual rate of 7% and in \n2010 accounted for more than 60% of the South\u2019s economic output. The \nstellar performances of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India \nwere major factors in this trend. \n\nThe contribution of the region to world output growth rose \nfrom 27% in 1981 to 51% in 2010 (although this increase is somewhat \nmagnified by the global crisis). But even without the PRC and India, \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s share of world GDP nearly doubled (from 5.1% in 1980 \nto 9.6% in 2010).\n\nFor developing Asia, looking South is becoming increasingly \nimportant for at least three reasons. First, large welfare gains are \nassociated with more closely integrated Southern economies, particularly \nin view of \u201cfactory Asia\u201d (see below) and developing Asia\u2019s emergent \nmiddle class. Second, developing Asia can be a primary resource \nfor knowledge sharing. Third, a Southern hemisphere that is more \neconomically open and diversified in trade relationships and \ninvestment flows can potentially address global imbalances. \n\nWelfare gains\n\nGiven the potential gains, trade in goods and services will \nremain a key engine of growth for Southern economies, \nincluding developing Asia\u2019s. Driven by increasing demand \nfrom economies that have been growing at rates above the \nworld average, by the proliferation of international production \nnetworks, and by the progressive dismantling of trade barriers, \nSouth\u2013South trade has been expanding rapidly. In 1990\u20132009, \nits share in world trade rose by almost one and a half times, \nfrom 7% to 17% (Figure 2.1.3). \n\n2.1.2  GDP growth by region\n\nAfrica\nLatin America \nMajor industrial economies\n\nDeveloping Asia\nMiddle East\nOther North\n\n2000\u22122010\n\n1980\u22121990\n\n1990\u22122000\nNote: Data refer to 10-year averages of regional GDP growth rates weighted by \ngross national income (World Bank Atlas method).\nSources: ADB calculations based on data from International Monetary Fund. \n2010.

With economic \nintegration will come greater access to wider markets and \nresources for firms (which fosters specialization, affords scale \neconomies, and promotes employment), more competitive and \nefficient market environments that benefit consumers, and more \nattractive rates of return on capital investments that encourage \ntechnology-transferring foreign direct investment (FDI)\u2014all of which will \ntranslate into higher growth rates and improved well-being of the trading \npartners\u2019 populations. \n\nPut differently, by combining their varied resources and markets, \n\nSouthern countries will acquire a bigger platform from which to build \nphysical, social, and institutional infrastructure; expand employment \nopportunities; accumulate capital; upgrade technology; diversify \nproduction; and raise income levels. \n\nFor developing Asia, two factors hold the potential of adding to the \nbenefits of economic integration. First, there is the model of factory Asia, \nin which parts and components move through cross-border production \nnetworks with the PRC as the last-stage assembly hub for exporting \nfinal products to countries in the North. This phenomenon opened an \nopportunity for other countries in developing Asia with narrow export \nbases. The competitive position of the PRC and its growing economic \nmuscle, in particular, brought numerous benefits to neighboring countries \nthrough employment creation in ancillary industries with their backward \nand forward links, greater access to regional markets, and higher growth. \nThese production networks are not, however, geared toward producing \n\nfinal goods for the price-sensitive consumers of developing countries\u2014as \nthey were primarily designed to produce high-quality products for \nconsumers in the North. \n\nThere are currently no such networks spanning developing Asia, on \n\nthe one hand, and the other regions of the South, on the other. Thus \nthe concept and technologies of factory Asia can possibly be exported \nto, say, Africa and Latin America with the networks being designed to \nproduce goods for the price-elastic markets in those regions. Not only \nwill developing Asia\u2019s FDI in these new networks enhance employment \nopportunities, raise workers\u2019 incomes, increase domestic demand, and \nenhance growth prospects, it will also address in part global imbalances \nby recycling high savings in developing Asia into investment in the South.\nConsider the prospects for Latin America, in particular. Most Latin \nAmerican countries have attained middle-income status and are oriented \nto domestic expenditure. They are therefore prime markets for factory \nAsia. A problem is the large infrastructure investment needed to improve \nthe links and reduce the costs of trade. If the high savings of developing \nAsia can be channeled to fund these infrastructure projects, however, \n\n\f42    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\ntrade costs may be sufficiently reduced to make the expansion of factory \nAsia to Latin America feasible. \n\nThe second factor is developing Asia\u2019s emerging middle class. These \n\nconsumers are less sensitive to price differentials, and so are driving \ndemand for high-quality products in the region. This group can possibly \nabsorb part of the high-quality exports of Southern economies that used \nto go to the North.\n\nLearning from peers\n\nGreater integration will allow the economies of the South to share \nexperiences and to learn from each other. In an interconnected world of \nmultipolar growth, there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d model of development. \nThis raises the imperative for countries to diversify sources of knowledge \nand share development experiences. Happily, as a consequence of \nrapid improvements in information and communications technology, \nNorth\u2013South and South\u2013South knowledge exchanges are becoming more \nfrequent. Within the South, the specific expertise of Southern countries \ntends to be easier to adapt and use, providing efficient development \nsolutions and complementing the ones available in conventional North\u2013\nSouth cooperation. \n\nIndeed, peer-to-peer learning (the sharing of know-how, good \npractices, and innovation) and technology transfer remain major \nmotivators for South\u2013South cooperation. Arenas include the Africa \nplatform, the Ibero\u2013American Program in Latin America and the \nCaribbean, and the South\u2013South Knowledge Exchange Platform \nsponsored by the World Bank Institute. \n\nExamples of successful partnerships in knowledge exchanges abound, \nespecially between Africa and Asia (as discussed in Wider economic links \nfor development, below). \n\nRebalancing\n\nSouth\u2013South links are creating new drivers of aggregate demand that \nare likely to foster a more resilient and balanced growth of the world \neconomy. Having experienced significant economic setbacks during the \nrecent crisis, industrial economies will take a while to reassume their role \nas the primary source of demand for the global economy. \n\nAt the same time, economies of the South have shown strong promise \n\nto grow rapidly (see Part 1 of this Asian Development Outlook 2011). The \nrising consumption of emerging economies and new investment flows \nwithin the South represent opportunities for more diversified drivers \nof global growth. To make these prospects a reality and to assist in the \nglobal recovery process, however, economies in the South will need to \nbecome more open to trade and capital flows from each other, and their \ndomestic expenditures will have to increase\u2014not just for consumption \nbut also for investment\u2014to help to drive South\u2013South trade and FDI.\n\nImpediments to tapping potential gains\nThat gains from closer economic integration within the South are not \nfully realized suggests that there are problems to be hurdled. These come \nin the form of persistent trade barriers and uncompetitive domestic \n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    43\n\n2.1.5  Average tariff rates\nEast Asia and the Pacific\nMiddle East and North Africa\nUnited States\n\nLatin America \n\nSouth Asia\nSub-Saharan Africa\nEuropean Union\n\n%\n\n45\n\n36\n\n27\n\n18\n\n9\n\n0\n\n1990\n\n95\n\n2000\n\n05\n\n08\n\nNote: Data refer to the simple average of most-favored-nation rates  for all \nproducts.

Average tariff \nrates have declined across the globe over the last two decades \n(Figure 2.1.5), with the reductions more significant for the South. \nWhat has been overlooked, however, is that import duties that \nSouthern countries impose on goods originating from other \nSouthern countries are significantly higher than the rates levied \non goods coming from Northern countries. \n\nIn addition, structural weaknesses (such as poor trade-\nrelated infrastructure and logistics) and nontariff barriers \n(inefficient administrative procedures, for example) continue \nto hinder the expansion of trade among Southern countries by \nadding significantly to transaction costs. Consequently, affluent \nmarkets in the North remain the preferred destination of the \nSouth\u2019s final-goods exports. In 2009, developing Asia\u2019s trade \nwith\tother\tregions\tof\tthe\tSouth\twas\tworth\t$780\tbillion\u2014its\t\ntrade\twith\tthe\tNorth\tcame\tto\t$2,280\tbillion.\t\n\nThe elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers can therefore \n\nsignificantly expand South\u2013South final goods trade and boost the growth \nof Southern economies over the medium term. Policies that lower trade \nbarriers and implement trade-facilitating and customs-harmonizing \ninitiatives will promote trade in final goods across Southern regions. \nIn turn, this expansion in trade across the South will allow many of its \ndeveloping economies to transition from labor-intensive to capital- and \nknowledge-intensive manufacturing, in effect setting them on a higher \ngrowth profile. \n\nWhile expanding factory Asia to other regions in the South may raise \n\nincomes, improve employment opportunities, and increase growth rates \nin the long run, it may be dislocative in the short and medium run. Faced \nwith more intense competition, domestic industries may be unable to \nthrive; undercapitalized, they may be crowded out of markets for scarce \nresources, such as skilled labor and capital equipment. \n\nHence industrial and regulatory policies may need to mitigate the \ninitial ill-effects of opening up the more autarkic economies to trade and \ninvestment. Indeed, this can be a topic for knowledge sharing among \npolicy makers in the South.\n\nImportance of trade and foreign direct investment\nTwo avenues for South\u2013South cooperation should be emphasized: trade \nand FDI. Both are private sector\u2013led and market-oriented initiatives that \npromote economic efficiency. Moreover, as trade volumes and investment \nflows increase among countries, payoffs to maintaining and deepening \nties rise correspondingly. Trade and FDI are usually forerunners of deeper \nand broader sociocultural and political international relations. Finally, \nas discussed above, trade and FDI are drivers of economic growth and \ndevelopment.\n\nWhy focus on South\u2013South trade? For one overriding reason: trade \nwill continue to be an engine of growth for Southern economies, though \n\n\f44    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nthe largest marginal gains are not in North\u2013South trade. As noted \nabove, an issue that has gone under the radar is that South\u2013South trade \nand nontrade barriers are now higher than those facing North\u2013South \nexchange. Thus Southern countries need to lower tariffs on imports from \nother Southern countries, and construct trade-facilitating infrastructure \nto reduce transaction costs and open up more widely South\u2013South trade \nroutes. \n\nAs for capital investment, it is important to highlight South\u2013\nSouth FDI for the following reasons. First, South\u2013South FDI may be \nbetter suited to developing-country conditions. Perhaps introducing \ntechnologies that are not as advanced, capital investment from the South \nmay be more labor intensive and require skill and education levels that \nare well within the capabilities and attributes of the workforce in a \ndeveloping country. \n\nOr the entrepreneurial experience of multinational companies from \nthe South may allow them to better navigate developing-country markets \nand political conditions (Aykut and Goldstein, 2006). In addition, FDI \nfrom the South may be better able to produce products for the South\u2019s \ngenerally lower-income markets (Prahalad, 2004). A case in point: the \n$2,500\t\u201cPeople\u2019s\tCar\u201d\tof\tIndia\u2019s\tTata\tMotors.\n\nSecond, its cyclical fluctuations being different from those of North\u2013\n\nSouth flows, FDI from the South may possibly reduce the volatility of \ntotal financial flows in the South\u2014as observed in Africa, where investors \nfrom the PRC continued to undertake projects even at the height of the \nglobal crisis (Davies, 2010). If so, the more stable financial flows will \npromote greater economic stability in the FDI host countries.\n\nThird, the size of South\u2013South FDI flows is an indicator of the state \n\nof financial integration among the economies of the South. The hope \nis that, with deeper financial markets, closer financial integration, and \nimproved institutions and investment climate, the South will see its \nsavings channeled toward investment opportunities in the South rather \nthan funneled to deficit spending in the North.\n\nAs trade and investment links among Southern countries flourish, \nwider economic links can be expected. Labor markets can become more \nunified, development experiences and technical cooperation initiatives \ncan be more widely shared, and macroeconomic policies can be better \ncoordinated. A more integrated South holds the promise of a sustainable \npath to growth and development.\n\nSouth\u2013South links as a sustainable path to \ngrowth and development\n\nThe region has grown rapidly in the past few decades and, together with \nAfrica, Latin America, and the Middle East, has emerged as the driver of \nglobal growth while recovery in the North struggles. Within the South, \nAsia\u2019s role is becoming more prominent. The rise of developing Asia as a \npotential source of world demand and its growing economic links with \nSouthern countries holds the promise of improving their prospects for \ngrowth and reducing global imbalances. But, can strengthening these \nlinks prove to be a harbinger of sustainable growth in developing Asia?\n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    45\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s links with the rest of the South have grown rapidly. \n\nTrade in goods and services by Southern economies has intensified to \ntake advantage of its potential gains. In contrast to trade integration, \nfinancial integration has not happened as deeply although both inward \nand outward FDI links have grown within the South. These are especially \nevident in developing Asia in comparison with Africa, Latin America, \nand the Middle East. However, while Southern economies have emerged \nas important sources of outward FDI, the majority of global outward FDI \nflows and stocks still originate in the North.\n\nStructural weaknesses in the South perpetuate its dependence on the \nNorth. In the real sector, the global crisis has highlighted the continuing \ndependence of the South on final demand from the North. And although \ntariffs have declined significantly, countries throughout the South still \nface numerous behind-the-border problems exacerbated by structural \nweaknesses and institutional failures. \n\nThe financial markets and regulatory structures in the South also \nremain underdeveloped. The economic crisis brought to the fore the \nSouth\u2019s heavy reliance on the North for parking its surplus savings into \nlow-risk assets there rather than recycling the funds within the region. \nThis, in turn, contributed to the expansion in global imbalances and also \nperpetuated the dearth of funds to finance crucial investment projects in \nthe region. \n\nOne key challenge for policy makers in emerging nations is therefore \nto create a regional and domestic enabling environment that will attract \nfinance to flow into local investments in the region. Even if these \nbottlenecks are eased, South\u2013South cooperation cannot be a panacea for \nall development challenges. The dependence of growth of the economies \nof the South on markets of the industrial world is still high and raises \nconcern about the sustainability of this growth if the North fails to revive \nfrom its slowdown soon.\n\nCloser financial and real integration holds the promise of raising \nconsumption and investment in the South, narrowing global imbalances, \nand sustaining growth in developing Asia. Closer financial market \nintegration would ensure that surplus funds from the South are used to \nfinance productive investments within the South. It would also break \nthe vicious circle of vulnerability to the fortunes of the North. In the \nreal sector, the South must carry on reducing bottlenecks to trade for \nexpanding final goods trade within the region to make up for the slack in \nthe North. \n\nFixing the real and finance sector problems will contribute to a rise \nin domestic expenditures in the South. In the short run, this would lead \nto a narrowing of global imbalances. In the longer term, closer links \namong Southern countries would foster the growth of new markets, \nimprove trade in goods and services, expand investments, provide greater \neconomic opportunities, and contribute significantly to their growth. \nGiven developing Asia\u2019s dominant role in the South, this would put its \ngrowth on a sustainable path. \n\nWith continued high dependence of the South\u2019s economies on markets \n\nof the industrial world, these stronger economic links would build a \nplatform on which the North and the global economy can grow again. \n\n\f46    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nExpanding South\u2013South \neconomic links through trade\n\nSouth\u2013South trade in goods has expanded considerably during the \nlast two decades. Its share of merchandise trade rose by a factor of 2.4, \nfrom about 7% in 1990 to 17% in 2009 (Table 2.2.1).3 To a large extent, \nthis trend was due to the emergence of factory Asia, fragmented-\nproduction networks that have the PRC as the last-stage assembly hub \nof production processes. The intermediate stages of the process are \nfarmed out throughout Asia, including Japan, and the final outputs are \nintended mainly for export to affluent markets in the North (ADB, 2010a), \nparticularly countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD). \n\nAs the PRC rose as a leading exporter and world-trade powerhouse, \n\n2.2.1  The rise of South\u2013South trade (%)\n\nGDP indicatorsa\n\n1990\u201391\n\n2000\u201301\n\n2006\u201307\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\nShare of world GDP held by:\nThe South\nDeveloping Asia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of \nIndia\nTrade indicatorsb\n\nSouth\u2013South trade as share of world trade\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s share of South\u2013South trade\n\nExports\nImports\nTrade\n\n79.8\n71.6\n75.7\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s share of South\u2013South trade\n35.1\n36.9\n36.0\n\nExports\nImports\nTrade\n\n88.2\n86.8\n87.5\n\n35.5\n43.9\n39.7\n\nIndia\u2019s share of South\u2013South trade\n\n1990\u201391\n\n2000\u201301\n\n2006\u201307\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n27.8\n13.1\n3.7\n3.0\n\n7.6\n6.2\n6.9\n\n2.1\n2.3\n2.2\n\n11.8\n13.2\n12.5\n\n33.6\n18.3\n7.3\n3.8\n\n10.2\n9.6\n9.9\n\n3.1\n1.6\n2.4\n\n20.2\n28.4\n24.3\n12.0\n\n47.2\n\n38.4\n22.8\n10.4\n4.7\n\n15.0\n14.1\n14.5\n\n79.8\n69.3\n74.6\n\n40.8\n37.8\n39.3\n\n3.7\n2.4\n3.0\n\n20.2\n30.7\n25.4\n\n39.7\n24.0\n11.5\n4.8\n\n16.3\n15.4\n15.9\n\n78.9\n66.0\n72.5\n\n41.2\n34.4\n37.8\n\n3.9\n4.7\n4.3\n\n21.1\n34.0\n27.5\n\n41.3\n25.7\n12.6\n5.2\n\n17.7\n16.1\n16.9\n\n80.3\n68.5\n74.4\n\n41.6\n38.4\n40.0\n\n4.9\n5.8\n5.4\n\n19.7\n31.5\n25.6\n22.8\n\n25.7\n\nOther South\u2019s share of South\u2013South trade\n\nDeveloping Asia's share of South\u2013\n\nSouth trade (growth, %)c\nOther South's share of South\u2013\nSouth trade (growth, %)c\n\nExports\nImports\nTrade\n\nExports\nImports\nTrade\n\nExports\nImports\nTrade\n\na GDP, purchasing power parity (current international $).  b Nonfuel merchandise trade.  c Average \nannual growth rate in 10 years (1990/91\u20132000/01); in 9 years (2000/01\u20132009). \nSources: Athukorala (forthcoming); ADB calculations using World Bank, World Development Indicators \nonline database (accessed 21 March 2011). \n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    47\n\ndeveloping Asia was transformed into an intricate web of regional \ntrade in parts and components. And as developing Asia consolidated \nits dominant position in the world trade of manufactures, the share of \nSouth\u2013South trade in global merchandise trade increased.\n\nSo dominant is developing Asia\u2019s role in South\u2013South trade that \n\nthe region accounts for about 75% of this commerce with the PRC \nalone taking up about 40%. Obviously, much of the traffic reflects the \nintraregional trade flows of factory Asia. But developing Asia\u2019s trade with \nother Southern regions has been expanding. With its growing appetite for \nprimary commodities, which it needs to fuel its rapid economic expansion, \ndeveloping Asia is driving up global demand for these goods, which come \nmainly from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. In turn, these \nmarkets\u2019 imports of Asian manufactures have been increasing as well.\nThus as several recent studies and reports have suggested\u2014see, \nfor example, Broadman (2007), Goldstein et al. (2006), and Santiso \n(2007)\u2014the \u201cChina factor\u201d (which is construed to include developing \nAsia) has proved to be both a boon and a bane for the rest of the South. \nFor countries with narrow export bases in primary commodities, \nhigher world demand in these goods\u2014including developing Asia\u2019s \nimport needs\u2014has created windfall gains from higher prices. For other \ncountries, factory Asia has been a powerful antagonist in third markets \nfor manufactured goods, crowding out the exports of some countries or \nprecluding entry altogether to industrialization\u2019s laggards. \n\nThe dilemma for the non-Asia South is therefore how to exploit gains \nfrom trade while avoiding the downside of specializing in natural resources.\nDespite this quandary, there is scope for the South to accelerate its \nintegration as a group and with the world economy by gradually clearing \nthe remaining bottlenecks to trade. Indeed, the integration of the South \npresents large potential benefits. Although Southern countries have \nlowered the level of applied tariffs considerably, they are still high by \nstandards of the North. Calculated from 2005\u20132008 data, average applied \ntariffs were 9.3% in the South, compared with 3.2% in the North. \n\nOther trade costs also arise out of developing countries\u2019 weaker \ntrade-related infrastructure and logistics, as well as institutional barriers. \nFor example, in 2010 it took 11 days and fewer than five documents, on \naverage, to export or import a standardized unit of cargo among OECD \neconomies, but it took more than twice as many days for countries in East \nAsia and almost three times as long for those in South Asia, with more \ndocuments involved (World Bank, 2010). \n\nSimilar constraints were found in Latin American and Middle \n\nEastern countries, and were most acute for the low-income economies of \nSub-Saharan Africa. Hence, as may be expected, the industrial countries \ngenerally received the highest marks in infrastructure and logistics \ncompetence per the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index, with \ndeveloping countries ranking much lower, with the notable exceptions of \nHong Kong, China and Singapore, the world\u2019s top-rated trading hubs.\nAssuming continued rapid economic growth in Asia and to a \nlesser extent in other developing countries, simulation analyses (see \nA simulation of South\u2013South trade, below) using a global economy model \nsuggests the following. First, the share of South\u2013South trade in global \ntrade is likely to double within the next two decades. Second, lowering \n\n\f48    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\ntariff barriers on South\u2013South trade to levels on South\u2013North trade \ncould bring as much as three-quarters of the welfare gains to Southern \ncountries as generated by the global elimination of tariff rates: South\u2013\nSouth trade would expand by 23%. Third, regional initiatives, such as \nthe expansion of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nfree trade agreement to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, \ncan potentially bring about substantial gains for developing Asia and \nsignificantly expand South\u2013South trade.\n\nTrade reforms in support of South\u2013South trade, however, must not \n\ncome at the expense of continuing global integration. In view of the \nproliferation of regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere, it is \nbecoming increasingly important for such pacts to be made as broad-\nbased as possible and to be compatible with World Trade Organization \n(WTO) provisions. \n\nA comparison of Asia\u2019s South\u2013South FTAs with their North\u2013\nSouth counterparts in five key areas\u2014tariff liberalization, rules of \norigin, liberalization of trade in services, WTO notification, and deep \nintegration\u2014reveals that the latter are generally more consistent with \nWTO and other global rules. Ensuring comprehensive and compatible \nFTAs in the future and improving existing South\u2013South agreements along \nsimilar lines offer Asia a promising path to follow toward freer trade. \n\n%\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nThe rise of South\u2013South trade\nUntil about two decades ago, South\u2013South trade in goods \nwas but a minor share of world trade. Records based on \nUNCTAD data spanning 1955 to 1985 reveal no discernible trend \n(Figure 2.2.1). By 1985, South\u2013South trade as share of total world \ntrade had increased only marginally, to 7.8%, from 7.1% in 1955, \nand South\u2013South trade still represented less than a third of \ndeveloping countries\u2019 total merchandise exports. \n\nStarting around 1990, a rapid upward trend set in, which has \n\nsince seen the growth of South\u2013South trade outpacing that of \ntotal world trade in both exports and imports. During 2000\u2013\n2009, the average growth of South\u2013South trade accelerated \nto 16% a year, from 14% in 1990\u20131997. By comparison, the \nexpansion of world trade was much slower during both periods, \nat 5.5% and 6%, respectively. Consequently, the share of South\u2013\nSouth trade in world trade rose from 7.4% in 1990 to 10.3% in \n2000 and 15.3% in 2007 (Figure 2.2.2). Due to emerging markets\u2019 \nhigher resilience to the downturn of global trade during the \nrecent crisis, world exports plunged more steeply than did \nSouth\u2013South trade, as a result of which the share of South\u2013\nSouth exports in world trade increased further, to 17.3% in 2009. \nIn parallel with this trend, South\u2013South trade as a share of \n\nSouthern regions\u2019 total trade also increased steadily between \n2000 and 2009 (Figure 2.2.3). \n\nIn the analyses that follow, trade in fuel (oil and gas) is \nexcluded from total merchandise trade. This does not materially \nalter the trends just discussed, since, as seen from Table 2.2.1 \nabove, the trade shares do not change by much.4 Excluding \n\n2.2.1  South\u2013South merchandise trade\nSouth\u2013South trade as share of world trade\nSouth's share of world trade\n\nValue\n\n$ billion\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n%\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n1955\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\nSource: Data taken from Table 1 of Athukorala (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2.2.2  Share of South\u2013South trade in world merchandise \ntrade\n\nExports\n\nImports\n\n95\n\n1990\n\n05\nSource: Data taken from Table 2 of Athukorala (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2000\n\n09\n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    49\n\n2.2.3  Share of South\u2013South trade in total Southern \nmerchandise trade\n\nImports\n\nExports\n\nImports\n\nExports\n\n95\n\n1990\n\n05\nSource: Data taken from Table 2 of Athukorala (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2000\n\n09\n\n2.2.4  Applied tariffs, simple mean\nSouth\n\nNorth\n\n1990\u221294\n\n2000\u221204\n\n1985\u221289\n\n1995\u221299\nNote: Data computed as 5-year averages except in 2005\u201308, which is a 4-year \naverage.\nSource: ADB calculations using UNCTAD\u2018s Trade Analysis and Information System \n(TRAINS) database through the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators \nonline database (accessed 15 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2005\u221208\n\n%\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\ntrade in fuel, however, is standard practice in trade-flow analysis \nfor two reasons. \n\nFirst, it prevents the sharp fluctuations in fuel prices from \naffecting trade ratios and, in turn, their comparability across \nperiods. Second, the incidence of fuel trade varies significantly \namong countries and regions, which tends to further blur \nsecular trends in trade shares. Indeed, commodity-specific price \ndeflators can alleviate this problem only to an extent. \n\nThree factors seem to account for much of the rapid \nexpansion of South\u2013South trade from the early 1990s: strong \neconomic growth in emerging economies, the rates of which \nwere above the world average; the rise of fragmented production \nand trade networks; and the progressive dismantling of trade barriers. \nAs has been well documented, while the global economy expanded \nrapidly during the last 20 years or so, developing countries as a group \ngrew even more impressively. As a result, Southern countries\u2019 share in \nworld GDP, adjusted for purchasing power parity, increased to about 40% \nin the late 2000s, from nearly 28% in the early 1990s (Table 2.2.1 above).\n\nThe expansion of global production sharing opened new opportunities \n\nfor developing countries to partake in international production chains \nand trade networks. In its formative years in the early 1990s, production \nsharing involved moving small fragments of the manufacturing process \nto low-cost countries and importing their component outputs to the host \ncountry for the last-stage fabrication. \n\nLater, production networks became more intricate, with firms in \ndifferent countries having charge of different stages of production, thus \nresulting in product fragments crossing multiple borders prior to final-\nproduct assembly in the host country. More recently, with international \nsupply networks of parts and components now well established, firms \nhave also started setting up final-assembly processes for a broad range \nof consumer durables (such as computers, cameras, televisions, and \nautomobiles) abroad, both to take advantage of cheap labor and to be \ncloser and more responsive to niche markets. \n\nToday, cross-border trade in parts and components has \ndeveloped into a truly global phenomenon, although it plays \na far more important role for developing Asia than for other \ndeveloping regions, given the region\u2019s integration with the world \neconomy (Box 2.2.1). Particularly with the emergence of the PRC \nas the premier final-assembly center of electronics and related \nproducts since the mid-1990s, intraregional flows of both parts \nand components and final goods have recorded phenomenal \ngrowth (see ADB, 2010a). \n\nFinally, developing countries have made considerable \n\nprogress in dismantling their tariff barriers, mainly in \ncompliance with regional and WTO commitments. The WTO \nInformation Technology Agreement of 2006 has been of \nparticular relevance for the production networks of electronics \nand information technology goods of developing Asia. Not only \ndid it free up commerce in this important segment of world \nmerchandise trade, it also stimulated the type of FDI into the PRC that \nhelped consolidate the country\u2019s role as the regional assembly hub. The \n\n\f50    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\n2.2.1  Global production sharing and South\u2013South trade\n\nTwo important structural features have characterized \nthe expansion of South\u2013South trade over the past two \ndecades: its heavy concentration in Asia and the dominance \nof manufactures in Asia. The region\u2019s rapid growth in \nmanufacturing trade has been underpinned by global \nproduction sharing,1 which in turn is reflected in the surge of \ncross-border trade in parts and components (box figure). \n\nParts and components share in manufacturing trade \nAfrica\n\nDeveloping Asia\nLatin America\n\nPeople's Rep. of China\nSouth\n\nExports\n\nDeveloping Asia\nAfrica\n\nPeople's Rep. of China\n\nLatin America\n\nSouth\n\n1996\n\n98\n\n2000\n\n02\n\n04\n\n06\n\n09\n\nImports\n\n33% for exports. These shares are much larger in Asia than \nother regions. Latin America has the second-highest share of \nparts and components trade\u201415% for exports and 32% for \nimports in 2009\u2014reflecting its participation in global value \nchains, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. \n\nComponent trade within global production networks \nnaturally leads to double counting of trade flows, because \nparts and components, which are manufactured in different \ncountries and at different stages of the production process, \ntypically cross borders multiple times before assembly into \nthe final product. This double counting can be avoided by \nnetting out parts and components from total manufacturing \ntrade. \n\nWhen it is, the shares of South\u2013South trade are lower \n\nthan the estimates reported in this section (Athukorala, \nforthcoming). In the case of exports, the difference seems \nsmall. For 2006\u20132007, the (2-year averaged) adjusted South\u2013\nSouth share in total world exports is 13.5%, down from 15%. \nFor imports, however, the adjustment lowers the share to \nbelow 11%, from 16%, which reflects the relative importance \nof parts and components in intra-Asian import trade.\nThus global production sharing seems to introduce \nan upward bias in estimates of the world trade share of \nSouth\u2013South trade and Asia\u2019s share in South\u2013South trade. \nStill, additional analysis (Athukorala, forthcoming) suggests \nthat overall trends in South\u2013South shares are remarkably \ninsensitive to the exclusion of parts and components. In other \nwords, the findings of strong growth in the world trade share \nof South\u2013South trade over the past decade or so and of Asia\u2019s \ndominant position in South\u2013South trade are robust. \n\n%\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1996\n\n98\nSource: Athukorala (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2000\n\n02\n\n04\n\n \n\n06\n\n09\n\nFrom 1996 to 1999, the share of parts and components \n\nin South\u2013South trade jumped from about 13% to nearly \n32% on the side of imports, and from about 14% to nearly \n\n1.

While average \ntariffs applied by the South in 2005\u20132008 came down to about \nhalf their levels of 1990\u20131994, they remain higher than the \nNorth\u2019s (Figure 2.2.4 above). Moreover, Southern exporters \nface higher tariffs when exporting to other countries in the \nSouth (6.1%), compared with shipping to the North (2.5%) \n(Figure 2.2.5).5 And the evidence indicates that, where Southern \nliberalization has occurred, such preferential trade agreements \ntend to have a narrower coverage of goods and take longer to \ncome into full effect than North\u2013South agreements, which are \nalso more compatible with global rules (Box 2.2.2). \n\n2.2.5  Average tariffs faced by the South when exporting to \nthe North and other South regions\n\nExporting to North\n\nExporting to South\n\n6.1\n\n2.5\n\nAverage tariffs faced by South\n\nNote: Derived from GTAP database in reference to year 2004.\nSource: Data taken from Appendix Table A.9 of Anderson and Strutt \n(forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    51\n\n2.2.2  Assessing South\u2013South vs North\u2013South Asian free trade agreements\n\nThe last decade has seen an unprecedented surge in free \ntrade agreements (FTAs) in Asia as part of efforts to deepen \nregionalism by focusing on sophisticated production networks. \nThere are over 60 concluded FTAs today compared with only \nthree in 2000. While the factors driving the proliferation of \nFTAs in Asia have been scrutinized, little attention has been \ndevoted to studying the evolution and anatomy of North\u2013\nSouth and South\u2013South FTAs, or the extent to which they are \ncompatible with global rules and each other.\n\nA structural shift in Asia\u2019s trade toward more South\u2013South \n\ntrade has accompanied the region\u2019s economic development. \nThe proportion of Asia\u2019s South\u2013South FTAs vs North\u2013South \nFTAs (39 vs 22) reflects these evolving trade patterns. But \nquantity does not necessarily equal quality. In five key \nareas under review\u2014tariff liberalization, rules of origin, \nliberalization of trade in services, World Trade Organization \n(WTO) notification, and deep integration\u2014North\u2013South \nFTAs were generally more compatible with WTO and other \nglobal rules. \n\nBeginning with tariff liberalization, the General Agreement \n\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XXIV states that \n\u201cduties are eliminated [on] substantially all trade \u2026 within \na reasonable length of time.\u201d Yet over one-third of all Asian \nSouth\u2013South FTAs have only limited goods coverage, while \nanother 40% eliminate tariffs on substantially all trade over \na period lasting more than 5 years. In contrast, roughly one-\nthird of North\u2013South FTAs eliminate tariffs upon entry into \nforce, while an additional 25% do so within 2\u20135 years.\n\nRules of origin determine the goods that enjoy preferential \n\ntariffs to prevent trade deflection (the entry of imports to a \nlow-tariff member of an FTA, when their ultimate destination \nis a higher tariff member) among FTA members. In practice, \nsuch rules can actually raise transaction costs for firms and \ngenerate confusion over compliance. This is especially the case \nwith rules of origin included in Asian South\u2013South FTAs. \nAccording to data from Kawai and Wignaraja (2011), over 30% \nof firms view rules of origin as an impediment to using South\u2013\nSouth FTAs, compared with only 13% for North\u2013South FTAs.\nConformity with the General Agreement on Trade in \nServices (GATS) Article V requires FTAs not to include \nrestrictions on the liberalization of such key services as \nbusiness and professional, communications, financial, \ntransport, and labor and business persons\u2019 mobility. Nearly \nthree-quarters of Asian North\u2013South FTAs liberalize trade in \nthese five services\u2014less than 20% of South\u2013South FTAs do, \nwhile nearly half exclude services or have limited coverage of \nservices at best. (The notable exceptions among South\u2013South \nagreements are the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n[ASEAN] FTA and other agreements involving Singapore.)\nSome GATT provisions essentially require a member \ncountry to notify and submit details to the WTO with regard \nto FTAs and related interim agreements. The intent is to \nimprove transparency in the global trading environment. \nRoughly two-thirds of South\u2013South FTAs comply with these \n\nnotification requirements, compared with 95% of North\u2013\nSouth FTAs. \n\nA thorny issue in the early days of the WTO Doha Round \n\nnegotiations concerned the depth of economic integration \nas measured by the so-called Singapore issues: investment, \ncompetition policy, government procurement, and trade \nfacilitation. While these issues were later dropped, they \nremain important for future trade policy negotiations. More \nthan 80% of Asian North\u2013South FTAs have at least some \ncoverage of the Singapore issues, compared with only about \n20% of South\u2013South FTAs.\n\nTo address the incompatibilities between North\u2013South and \nSouth\u2013South FTAs, new Asian FTAs should adopt the following \ngood practice guidelines for core areas, with modifications \nmade to existing FTAs where reviews are possible:\n\u2022\t\n\n Eliminate a minimum of 85% of all \n\n Design and administer rules that are \n\nTariff liberalization.\ntariffs within 10 years.\nRules of origin.\nguided by Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) \nprinciples of simplicity and consistency, as well as WTO \nrequirements of transparency and prospective application.\nServices liberalization.\n Incorporate at least five key services \nsectors\u2014business, communications, financial, transport, \nand labor and business persons\u2019 mobility\u2014and pursue \nreform of competition policy.\nWTO notification.\n Include procedural requirements to \npromote greater transparency and improve consistency \nwith global rules.\nDeep integration.\ninvestment and trade facilitation, and then address the \nmore difficult issues of competition policy and government \nprocurement.\nIn addition, the quality of FTAs in Asia can be enhanced \n\n First incorporate good practices on \n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nby setting up a regional advisory center to address limited \ninstitutional and human resource capacities among some \ncountries in the region. This center would engage legal \nadvisors, train officials, and lead studies to help countries \nbetter design, negotiate, and implement WTO-compliant and \nWTO-plus FTAs.  \n\nIn the medium to long term, a regionwide FTA would \n\nbe an important means to better align compatibilities in \nglobal and regional rules among Asia\u2019s North\u2013South and \nSouth\u2013South FTAs. Depending on its scope, the basis for \nsuch a regionwide FTA might be either ASEAN+3 (ASEAN \nplus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic \nof Korea); ASEAN+6 (ASEAN+3 plus Australia, India, and \nNew Zealand); or a Free Trade Agreement of the Asia\u2013Pacific \n(APEC members). A practical first step might be to take \nthe best features from current ASEAN FTAs and design a \ntemplate consistent with global rules. \n\nSource \n\nBased on Wignaraja and Lazaro (2010).\n\n\f2.2.6  South\u2013South trade, regional shares\n\nLatin America\n\nMiddle East\n\nAfrica\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nExports\n\nLatin America\nMiddle East\nAfrica\nDeveloping Asia\n\nImports\n\n1990\n\n95\n\n2000\n\n05\n\n09\n\n%\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n%\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n95\n\n2000\n\n05\n\n09\n\nNote: Merchandise trade, nonfuel.\nSource: Athukorala (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n52    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nThe regional profile of South\u2013South trade\nSouth\u2013South trade is dominated by developing Asia, in \nparticular by its expanding international production networks. \nComplementarities are now emerging among the economies of \nthe South.\n\nFigure 2.2.6 shows just how dominant developing Asia\u2019s shares \n\nof South\u2013South trade are compared with those of Africa, Latin \nAmerica, and the Middle East. In 1990\u20131991 (2-year average), \ndeveloping Asia accounted for about 88% of total South\u2013South \nexports and almost 87% of total South\u2013South imports. \n\nBy 2006\u20132007 (2-year average), however, these shares had \ndeclined to about 80% and 69%, respectively, due to the larger \nfraction taken up by Latin American exports and considerable \nincreases in the proportions of the other regions\u2019 imports. \nExpanding at an average rate of nearly 26% a year in 2000\u2013\n2009, South\u2013South trade in these regions grew faster than in \nAsia, at 23% (Table 2.2.1 above).6\n\nThe asymmetric decline of developing Asia\u2019s export and \nimport shares, however, actually points to the region\u2019s growing \nimportance as a manufacturing assembly center of global \nproduction networks: that PRC\u2019s imports from other Southern \nregions increased rapidly in recent years but not as much as did \nits manufacturing exports to these regions means that non-Asia \nSouth\u2019s exports to the PRC (or the PRC\u2019s imports from the non-Asia \nSouth) are not growing as fast as the PRC\u2019s exports to non-Asia South (or \nnon-Asia South\u2019s imports from the PRC). \n\n1990\n\nIn the case of the shares of South\u2013South trade in total trade, \nFigure 2.2.7 indicates that, for all the regions,7 the proportions were \nhigher for exports than for imports, although the gap narrowed over \n1990\u20132009. In 1990\u20131991 (2-year average), South\u2013South trade accounted \nfor 42% of total exports and nearly 34% of total imports in Asia. By \n2006\u20132007 (2-year average), the proportions had converged to about 50% \nand 49%, respectively. \n\nThis is explained by the higher demand for imports among Southern \n\neconomies as a result of their strong growth performance and the \nemergence of greater trade complementarities between them, as their \nproduction structures became more diversified over time. Particularly \nfor developing Asia, such complementarities have arisen out of the \ninternational division of labor within regional production networks. \n\nThe most striking development in South\u2013South trade has been the \n\nPRC\u2019s rise as the regional hub of international production and trade \nnetworks. Between 1990 and 2009, the PRC\u2019s share of Asia\u2019s South\u2013South \ntrade rose from nearly 40% to almost 52% in the case of exports, and \nfrom 51% to 56% in the case of imports (Figure 2.2.8). \n\nAs a proportion of its total exports, the PRC\u2019s exports to the South \nincreased from 37% in 1990 to almost 50% in 2009, while the comparable \nnumbers for its imports are 46% for 1990 and 51% for 2009. That the \nimport side has a larger Southern share reflects the PRC\u2019s reliance on \nother East Asian countries for parts and components used in final \nassembly as well as its dependence on other Southern countries for \nprimary inputs. \n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    53\n\n2.2.7  Share of South\u2013South trade in total Southern \nmerchandise trade\n\n2.2.8  Share of developing Asia\u2019s South\u2013South trade, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nDeveloping Asia\nLatin America\n\nMiddle East\nSouth\n\nAfrica\n\nExports\n\nShare in  exports \nGeographic composition share\nIntra-Asian share \nShare in  imports \n\nExports\n\n1990\n\nDeveloping Asia\nLatin America\n95\n\nMiddle East\nSouth\n\n2000\n\nAfrica\n\n05\n\n09\n\nImports\n\nShare in  imports \nGeographic composition share\nIntra-Asian share \n\nValue\n\n1990\u221291\n\n2000\u221201\n\n2006\u221207\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\nImports\n\n%\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n%\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n%\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1990\n\n95\n\n2000\n\n05\n\n09\n\nNote: Merchandise trade, nonfuel.\nSource: Athukorala (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n1990\u221291\n\n2000\u221201\n\n2006\u221207\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\nNotes: Merchandise trade, nonfuel.

By 2008\u20132009 (2-year average), these \nshares declined only marginally, to about 77% and 85%, \nrespectively. In comparison, the shares of intraregional trade of \nthe other regions are considerably lower. \n\nAt the level of individual countries (not shown in the \n\ngraphs), intraregional shares are highest among Asian countries, \nparticularly for the high-performing economies of East Asia \nthat are linked to the regional production networks. \n\nDeveloping Asia is the prime destination of other regions\u2019 \n\nexports outside the regions themselves (Figure 2.2.10). In \n2006\u20132007 (2-year average), it absorbed almost 16% of the \nexports of the Middle East and more than 9% of the exports of \nboth Latin America and Africa. In contrast, these regions took \nsmall shares of Asian exports, with the Middle East the highest \nat only 4%. \n\nA similar picture emerges for imports by origin: developing \n\nAsia\u2019s share in other regions\u2019 imports is substantial, ranging \nfrom 18% to 23%, whereas the regions themselves draw but a \n\n2.2.9  Intraregional shares of South\u2013South trade by region\n2009\n\n1990\u221291\n\n2006\u221207\n\n2000\u221201\n\n2008\n\nExports\n\n1990\u221291\n2008\n\n2000\u221201\n2009\n\nDeveloping\nAsia\n\nMiddle\nEast\n\n2006\u221207\n\nAfrica\n\nLatin\nAmerica\n\nImports\n\nDeveloping\nAsia\n\nMiddle\nEast\n\nAfrica\n\nLatin\nAmerica\n\nNotes: Merchandise trade, nonfuel.

The PRC\u2019s share of the region\u2019s \ntotal imports from the South outside Asia increased from \nabout 15% in the early 1990s to about 38% by 2008\u20132009 (2-year \naverage\u2014Figure 2.2.11). \n\nDuring this period, the PRC accounted for almost 80% \n\nof the total increment of developing Asia\u2019s imports from \nthese regions. Indeed, its shares have increased rapidly across \nall three subcategories of imports (fuel, nonfuel primary \ncommodities, and manufactures), with that of nonfuel primary \nproducts showing the sharpest increase (from 33% in the early \n1990s to 61% in 2008-9). \n\nOn the exports side, the PRC\u2019s share of the region\u2019s exports \nto Southern markets outside Asia increased from about 28% in \nthe early 1990s to 48% in 2008\u20132009 (2-year average), driven \npredominantly by the rapid growth of manufacturing exports. \nAs for the PRC\u2019s trade ties with each of Southern regions, it \nturns out that the PRC\u2019s shares in developing Asia\u2019s trade with \nAfrica and Latin America have grown the fastest. By 2008\u2013\n2009, the PRC accounted for 58% and 65% of developing Asia\u2019s \ntotal imports from Africa and Latin America, respectively. On \nthe export side, the PRC accounted for 51% of regional exports \nto Africa, up from about 30% in the early 1990s. For Latin \nAmerica, these flows increased from 34% to 54%, and, for the \nMiddle East, from 22% to 40% (Figure 2.2.12). \n\nIn 2008, total trade between the PRC and Latin America \n\nreached\t$138\tbillion,\tan\tincrease\tof\tabout\t33%\tfrom\ta\tyear\t\nearlier. This was more than three times the increase in Latin \nAmerica\u2019s trade with the United States and Europe over the \nsame period.8 PRC\u2019s trade with Latin America is principally an\nexchange of primary commodities for manufacturing goods (as \nis its trade with Africa). Mining products account for nearly \nhalf of the region\u2019s exports to the PRC, followed by agriculture \ncommodities, with a share of 35%. \n\nApproximately 90% of the region\u2019s exports to the PRC come \n\nfrom just four countries: Brazil (41%), Chile (23%), Argentina \n(16%), and Peru (9%) (IADB, 2010). Although PRC products are \nrapidly penetrating markets in all the Latin American countries, \nthe natural-resource endowment of many countries does not \nallow them to capture a significant share of the PRC\u2019s demand. \nConsequently, some Latin American countries are accumulating \ntrade deficits with the PRC, which in turn are reflected as \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s persistent trade surpluses with Latin America, \nsimilar to Africa\u2019s, though thus far these are relatively mild. \nOnly the Middle East as a region has been accumulating a \nsizeable trade surplus with Asia, mainly due to fuel. \n\n2.2.10  Direction of trade, 2006\u20132007\n\nDeveloping Asia \n\nMiddle East \n\nAfrica\n\nLatin America \n\nExports\n\nDeveloping\nAsia \n\nDeveloping Asia \nMiddle\nAfrica\nEast \n\nMiddle East \nAfrica\nLatin America \n\nLatin\nAmerica \n\nExporting region\n\nImports\n\nDeveloping\n Asia \n\nMiddle\nEast \n\nAfrica\n\nLatin\nAmerica \n\nImporting region\n\nNotes: Merchandise trade, nonfuel.

First, manufactured goods account \nfor the majority of Asia\u2019s exports to the South. Rising steadily \nover the years, this share reached about 83% in 2006\u20132007. \nExport shares of other regions are considerably smaller \n(Figure 2.2.13 top panel). \n\nSecond, manufactures account for the largest share of \nAsian South\u2013South imports\u2014about 64% in 2006\u20132007. Asia\u2019s \nmanufacturing share somewhat resembles that of the South as a \nwhole. But Asia\u2019s imports of manufactures also include trade in \nparts and components for assembly and reexport in relation to \nfactory Asia, while other regions are mostly at the receiving end \nof final goods (Figure 2.2.13 bottom panel). \n\nThird, primary commodities, fuel in particular, constitute \na substantial share of Asia\u2019s imports from the South. Although \nthe share of commodities in Asia\u2019s imports is not very far from \nthe average share of the South, these relative measures mask the \nscale of such imports by Asia. The PRC\u2019s imports of fuel and \nother primary commodities alone increased just over two-fold \nfrom the 2-year average for 1990\u20131991 and 2006\u20132007, from \n$52\tbillion\tto\t$163\tbillion.\t\n\nFourth, new developments are likely to emerge with the \nPRC\u2019s strengthening trade ties with other regions of the South, \nparticularly Africa and Latin America. Driven by its increasing \ndemand for primary resources, the PRC became Africa\u2019s largest \ntrading partner in 2009, surpassing both the European Union and the \nUnited States. The exports of the five oil-rich countries (Angola, Equatorial \nGuinea, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo, and Sudan) represent as much \nas 85% of Africa\u2019s exports to the PRC (Hanson, 2008). Much of the recent \ngrowth in these flows is accounted for by oil imports from Sudan and \nother African nations, although PRC firms also import a significant \namount of non-oil commodities, including timber, copper, and diamonds. \nThe PRC, however, recently began to import minerals, agricultural \nproducts, and some manufactured goods from Africa, such as processed \nfood and household consumer goods. This last development reflects the \nbudding interest of PRC firms in Africa as a growing market, for low-cost \nconsumer goods, in which establishing a commercial presence through \nFDI might prove profitable. And it has been facilitated by the progressive \nopening up of African economies and the privatization of their industries. \nAdditionally, the PRC has invested massively in Africa\u2019s fuel and \nmineral sectors, particularly in Angola, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, \nSudan, and Zambia.

These factors are reflected in the model \nby trade-weighted average most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs and the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index10 (LPI), respectively. \nBased on a worldwide survey of global freight forwarders \n\nand express carriers\u2014and complemented by a number \nof qualitative and quantitative indicators of the trade \nand transport-related infrastructure, institutions, and \nthe performance of supply chains\u2014the LPI measures the \ncomparative performance of countries in various dimensions on \na five-point scale. For the 2010 survey, the LPI scores indicate \nthat countries in the South, on average, continued to score \nconsiderably lower than those in the North, with Africa and the \nlow-income countries having cellar rankings (Figure 2.2.14). \n\nThe rankings, then, confirm the well-known bottlenecks to \ntrade that beset developing countries, in particular the poorest \namong them. In the context of South\u2013South trade, however, \neasing these bottlenecks assumes greater importance in that the \nimpediments exist on both sides of the trading relationship. \n\nIn other words, further tariff reductions and easier access \n\nto Southern markets through improved road and ports \ninfrastructure, efficient logistics, and better customs procedures, \namong other factors, which in turn facilitate closer integration \nand more trade among countries in the South, are likely to \ngenerate benefits beyond those that accrue from the South\u2019s \ncloser integration with the global economy in general.\n\nLong-standing policy efforts at regional and multilateral \n\nlevels\u2014mainly under the auspices of the WTO Doha \nDevelopment Round\u2014have intensified trade facilitation efforts to \nimprove the South\u2019s access to world markets and to lower its trade costs. \nThe initial benefits of these measures, such as improved trade-related \ninfrastructure and more efficient and timely handling of international \nshipments, are already coming through in the 2010 LPI scores. \n\nCompared with 3 years earlier, the South\u2019s score shows a marked \nimprovement, although it remains much below the North\u2019s performance \n(Figure 2.2.14). Continuing efforts at trade facilitation, with trade-related \naid providing critical infrastructure in the poorer Southern countries, \nwill be crucial to furthering the South\u2019s growing involvement in global \ntrade along South\u2013South lines. \n\nA simulation of South\u2013South trade\nTo what extent can trade policy potentially foster integration among \nSouthern markets? Anderson and Strutt (forthcoming) use a global-\neconomywide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model (Box 2.2.3) to \nproject outcomes to 2030 of various trade-reform scenarios and evaluate \nthem against a core baseline setting.\n\nCare must be taken, however, in interpreting the simulation results. \n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    57\n\n2.2.3  South\u2013South trade in 2030: The Global Trade Analysis Project model and core modeling assumptions\n\nThe background study to this section (Anderson and \nStrutt, forthcoming) employs the standard Global Trade \nAnalysis Project (GTAP) model (Hertel, 1997) and \nVersion 7.1 of the GTAP database.\n\nThe GTAP database\u2019s current baseline depicts the world \n\neconomy as of 2004. For the analysis discussed in this \nsection, a new core baseline for 2030 is projected under \nthe assumptions that each country\u2019s stock of agricultural \nland and trade-related policies do not change throughout \nthe 26-year period of analysis, but that national real GDP, \npopulation, unskilled and skilled labor, capital, and other \nnatural resources (such as oil, gas, and coal) grow at \nexogenously set rates (Box table). \n\nThe exogenous growth rates are based on Lee and \n\nHong (2010), OECD, USDA, and World Bank projections, \nalong with those of Tyers and Golley (2010), Valenzuela \nand Anderson (2010), and Walmsley and Strutt (2009), \nplus historical trends in mineral and energy raw material \nreserves from BP (2010) and the US Geological Survey \n(2010). Past annual rates of change in fossil fuel reserves \n\nsince 1990 are assumed to continue for each country over \nthe next two decades. For other minerals, in the absence \nof country-specific data, the unweighted average of the \nannual rate of growth of global reserves for iron ore, \ncopper, lead, nickel, and zinc between 1995 and 2009 (US \nGeological Survey, 2010) is used for all countries. \nGiven those exogenous growth rates, the model \nderives implied rates of total factor productivity (TFP) \nand per capita GDP growth. For any one country, the \nrate of TFP growth is assumed to be the same in each \nof its nonprimary sectors and to be somewhat higher in \nits primary sectors. Higher productivity growth rates for \nprimary activities were characteristic of the latter half \nof the 20th century (Martin and Mitra, 2001) and are \nnecessary in this projection if real international prices of \nprimary products (relative to the aggregate change for all \nproducts) are to follow a relatively flat trend. Once those \nhigher TFP rates for primary sectors are determined, the \nuniform TFP rates for nonprimary sectors are recalculated \nto ensure that targeted GDP levels are obtained. \n\nAverage annual GDP and endowment growth rates, 2004\u20132030\n\nGTAP regional agglomeration\n\nGDP \ngrowth\n\nPopulation \ngrowth\n\nUnskilled \nlabor\n\nSkilled \nlabor\n\nCapital\n\nOil\n\nGas\n\nCoal\n\nWestern Europe\nEastern Europea\nUnited States and Canada\nAustralia and New Zealand\nJapan\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nRest of East Asia\nSoutheast Asia\nSouth Asia\nCentral Asia\nThe Pacific\nLatin America\nMiddle East and Africa\n\nNorth\nSouthb\n\nTotal\n\nOf which: Developing Asia\n\n1.72\n3.52\n2.34\n2.89\n1.04\n6.63\n3.69\n4.60\n6.22\n4.53\n3.61\n3.99\n4.34\n\n1.95\n\n4.83\n\n5.40\n\n2.54\n\n0.12\n-0.34\n0.83\n0.98\n-0.44\n0.29\n0.38\n1.04\n1.27\n0.73\n1.53\n1.01\n2.03\n\n0.15\n\n1.10\n\n0.83\n\n0.91\n\n-0.03\n0.18\n0.77\n0.83\n-0.71\n0.49\n-0.14\n1.06\n1.66\n0.52\n1.98\n1.33\n1.89\n\n0.25\n\n1.03\n\n0.66\n\n0.38\n\n-0.68\n0.66\n-0.20\n-0.17\n-1.38\n2.35\n1.62\n2.82\n3.05\n0.59\n3.54\n2.76\n2.09\n\n-0.51\n\n2.36\n\n2.24\n\n-0.19\n\n1.80\n4.04\n2.54\n3.32\n1.30\n8.00\n4.09\n4.67\n7.41\n4.50\n3.60\n4.11\n4.33\n\n2.08\n\n5.52\n\n6.41\n\n2.97\n\n2.81\n2.64\n1.00\n1.49\n0.00\n-0.40\n0.00\n1.31\n0.24\n2.81\n1.54\n3.29\n1.27\n\n2.07\n\n1.48\n\n0.72\n\n1.67\n\n0.77\n0.12\n-0.14\n6.10\n0.00\n4.85\n0.00\n1.48\n-0.47\n0.77\n1.21\n-0.34\n3.64\n\n0.40\n\n2.24\n\n0.93\n\n1.23\n\n-2.51\n-1.86\n0.19\n3.55\n-9.34\n5.62\n-1.59\n11.71\n4.83\n-2.51\n0.15\n5.15\n1.89\n\n-0.26\n\n5.57\n\n5.93\n\n2.50\n\na Includes the Russian Federation. b South comprises Africa, developing Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

First, the dataset used in the simulations \nis aggregated and calibrated to fit the requirements of the CGE model and \nis not necessarily consistent with the historical time series. \n\nSecond, calibrated to the world economy as of 2004, the dataset does \n\n\f58    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nnot reflect the effects of the recent crisis, particularly the slowdown in \nthe industrial world and its concomitant effects on the relative shares of \nthe North and South in global GDP and trade. To capture the influences \nof these developments at least to a degree, the growth assumptions of \ncountry aggregates are set to be fairly conservative in order to incorporate \nrelative shifts over the long horizon of the simulations. (See the regional \ngrowth assumptions in Box 2.2.3.) \n\nThird, in the simulations, the shares of regional aggregates relative \nto world trade or total South\u2013South trade refer to total trade in goods \nand services. That is, they reflect a far broader category of trade flows \nand have different effects for aggregates of the North and South, where \nservices trade is far smaller. These trade shares are also not directly \ncomparable to those derived from the UN Comtrade database\u2014the basis \nof the descriptive analysis above\u2014which covers only merchandise goods. \nUnfortunately, the two series cannot be reconciled because historical data \non services between pairs of countries are unavailable.\n\nThese caveats notwithstanding, the simulation analyses provide \ninsights to the relative changes in the regions\u2019 GDP and trade shares \nas well as on shifts in bilateral trade shares under alternative sets of \nassumptions concerning the global outlook over a horizon of more than \n20 years. \n\nThe core baseline projection: \nSector and regional shares of GDP and trade\n\nBox 2.2.3 summarized the assumptions on the growth of \nGDP and factor inputs underlying the core projection to \n2030. Together, these assumptions set the parameters for the \nstructures of production, consumption, and trade across sectors \nboth in and between countries. \n\nAs for the outcomes, these may be described as follows. \nIn aggregate, the faster-growing South\u2014developing Asia in \nparticular\u2014accounts for much larger shares of the projected \nglobal economy (Figure 2.2.15). The South\u2019s aggregate share \nof world GDP rises from 20% in 2004 to 35% in 2030. For \ndeveloping Asia, this proportion, when the PRC is included, \ngoes from 11% to 22%, and when the PRC is excluded, from \n4.1% to 10.6%. (In other words, more than half developing Asia\u2019s \nincreasing share of world GDP is due to developing Asia other \nthan the PRC.)\n\nPopulation shares change much less. Over 2004\u20132030, it \nis projected that the South\u2019s share rises from 80% to 84% but \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s falls somewhat, from 55% to 53%. Combined \nwith the GDP growth assumptions, the net effect is that per \ncapita incomes converge significantly: the ratio of the North\u2019s \ncountry average to the South\u2019s falls by almost a half by 2030. \nFor developing Asia, per capita income rises from 20% to 42% of \nthe global average.\n\nThe South\u2019s share of global exports nearly doubles, rising \nfrom 33% in 2004 to 55% in 2030 (Figure 2.2.16).

Similarly, the South\u2019s import share rises, albeit not \nas dramatically. For developing Asia, the ratio increases from \n18% to 29%. Capital flows balance each region\u2019s global export \nand import shares.\n\nServices\n\nThe South\u2019s share of primary-product exports rises slightly, \nwhile its share of manufactures exports soars (doubling in the \ncase of Asia, as does its share of services exports\u2014Figure 2.2.17). \nLikewise, the South\u2019s share of primary-product imports rises \nsubstantially (Figure 2.2.18), due largely to developing Asia\u2019s \nexpected continuing rapid industrialization.11\n\nOther primary\n\nManufactures\n\nAgriculture \n(food)\n\n2004\n\n2030\n\n2004\n\n2030\n\n2004\n\n2030\n\n2004\n\n2030\n\n2.2.17  Sector shares of global exports (baseline to 2030)\nNorth \n\nSouth: Developing Asia\n\nSouth: Other South\n\nIn addition, the South increases its share of world imports \nby 44% and of manufactures imports by 25%. The increase in \nthe latter is due to the ongoing fragmentation of the production \nof manufactured goods with its multi-component supply chain, \neach segment of which can be set up in a footloose fashion. \nIndeed, the simulation analyses do not fully capture the effects of these \nproduction networks because of the high degree of aggregation \nof manufacturing industries in the CGE model used.\n\nThe South\u2019s share of farm-product exports remains virtually \n\nunchanged (Figure 2.2.19). Its share of farm-products import, \nhowever, surges, due mainly to the PRC, but also because of \nIndia. Higher import demand for agriculture and food products \nis projected for these countries despite the fact that their shares \nof agriculture in GDP and of land in factor incomes are also \nexpected to rise slightly, instead of falling in the usual way as \neconomic development proceeds. \n\nFor the sector shares of trade at the country level (not \nshown in the chart), the consequences of continuing Asian \nindustrialization are again evident: primary products are \nless important in the South\u2019s exports and considerably more \nimportant in its imports; conversely, nonprimary products \nfigure more significantly in the South\u2019s exports and less so in \nits imports. Moreover, the increases in primary-product imports and \nnonprimary product exports are largest for developing Asia. \n\nThe opposite is true for the North, reflecting the fact that what one \n\npart of the world imports the remaining part of the world must \nexport to maintain equilibrium. Newly industrializing countries \nare thus poised to become far more dependent on food imports, \nwhich may raise problems of sustainability. \n\nOn bilateral trade patterns, the core projection indicates \nthat South\u2013South trade as a share of global trade will double by \n2030, rising from 12.8% to 26.5% (Figure 2.2.20a-b). Consonant \nwith this trend, the trade share of Asia\u2019s developing countries \nmore than doubles, while that of the rest of the South increases \nby two-fifths. By contrast, the share of North\u2013North trade in \nglobal trade is projected to fall from 51.2% to 30.2%. \n\nFinally, the core projection suggests that the global trade \nshare of the North\u2019s exports to developing Asia will rise slightly \nby 2030, while that of developing Asia\u2019s exports to the North \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nSource: Data taken from Table 4 of Anderson and Strutt (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2.2.18  Sector shares of global imports (baseline to 2030) \n\nSouth: Other South\n\nSouth: Developing Asia\n\nNorth\n\nServices\n\nOther primary\n\nManufactures\n\nAgriculture \n(food)\n\n2004\n\n2030\n\n2004\n\n2030\n\n2004\n\n2030\n\n2004\n\n2030\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nSource: Data taken from Table 4 of Anderson and Strutt (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n%\n\n2.2.19  Shares of world trade in agricultural and food \nproducts (baseline to 2030)\nSouth: Developing Asia\n\nSouth: Other South\n\nNorth\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nExports\n\nImports\n\nExports\n\nImports\n\n2004 base\n\n2030 core base\n\nSource: Data taken from Table 5 of Anderson and Strutt (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f60    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nImporter: North\n2.2.20  Core baseline projections for bilateral trade, by exporting region\nImporter: South - Developing Asia\nImporter: South - Other South\na  Global trade (2004 base)\nImporter: South\n\nb  Global trade (2030 simulation)\n\nImporter: North\nImporter: South - Developing Asia\nImporter: South - Other South\nImporter: South\n\nImporter: North\nImporter: South - Developing Asia\nImporter: South - Other South\nImporter: South\n\nc  ASEAN+6 preferential liberalization (2030 \nsimulation)\n\nImporter: North\n\nImporter: South - Developing Asia\n\nImporter: South - Other South\n\nImporter: South\n\nNorth\n\nImporter: North\nSouth:\nSouth\nImporter: South - Developing Asia\nDeveloping \nAsia\nImporter: South - Other South\nImporter: South\n\nSouth:\nOther \nSouth\n\nd  ASEAN+6 most-favored-nation liberalization \n(2030 simulation)\n\ne  Global most-favored-nation liberalization \n(2030 simulation)\n\nf  Partial South\u2013South trade liberalization \n(2030 simulation)\n\nSouth\n\nNorth\n\nSouth:\nOther \nSouth\n\nSouth:\nDeveloping \nImporter: North\nAsia\nImporter: South - Developing Asia\nImporter: South - Other South\nImporter: South\n\nSouth\n\nNorth\n\nSouth:\nOther \nSouth\n\nSouth\n Developing \nAsia\nImporter: North\nImporter: South - Developing Asia\nImporter: South - Other South\nImporter: South\n\n%\n52\n\n39\n\n26\n\n13\n\n0\n\n%\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n32\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n%\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n%\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nNorth\n\nSouth: \nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nSouth: \nOther \nSouth\n\nSouth\n\nNorth\n\nSouth\n\nSouth:\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nSouth:\nOther \nSouth\n\nNorth\n\nSouth:\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nSouth:\nOther \nSouth\n\nSouth\n\nASEAN+6 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus Australia, People\u2019s Rep. of China, India, Japan, Rep. of Korea, and New Zealand.\nSource: Data taken from Table 8 of Anderson and Strutt (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\nwill nearly double, from 12.2% in 2004 to 21.5% in 2030.

Specifically, the gains to the South \noverall generate three-quarters of the benefits that the South \nobtains from a worldwide regime of zero tariffs (scenario c).\n\nThus each of these reforms raises the share of South\u2013South \n\ntrade above the core projection, albeit in varying degrees. \nUnsurprisingly, ASEAN+6 preferential trade reform (scenario a) \nincreases developing Asia\u2019s intraregional trade share in global \ntrade by almost 3 percentage points (Figure 2.2.20c above), \nand half a percentage point is taken off from this if ASEAN+6 \nlowers tariff rates to zero (scenario b\u2014Figure2.2.20d above). \nBut in both cases, the global trade share of South\u2013South trade \nincreases by 2.3 percentage points. \n\nIf all countries fully liberalize their goods trade (scenario c), \n\nthe share of South\u2013South trade increases by even more\u2014that \nis, 2.9 percentage points (from 26.5% in the core projection to \n29.4%\u2014Figure 2.2.20e above). As may be expected, the highest \nincrease in South\u2013South trade\u2019s global trade share is achieved \nunder broad South\u2013South liberalization (scenario d above), \nwhich boosts the estimate by 6.1 percentage points, or 23%, \nabove that of the core projection (Figure 2.2.20f above). \n\nHow are the other trade flows affected by increases in the \n\nworld trade share of South\u2013South trade? Under all scenarios considered, \nthe share of North\u2013North trade in world trade declines. In contrast, \nthe world trade share of North\u2013South trade increases under scenarios b \nand c, that is, with regional and global MFN liberalization, but decreases \nunder scenarios a and d, that is, with preferential liberalization involving \nASEAN+6 and the South as a whole. Perhaps not surprisingly, the \ndeclines in trade shares are more pronounced under South-wide tariff \nreductions, as a result of which the share of North-to-South exports \nand of South-to-North exports fall by 2.6 and 2.5 percentage points, \nrespectively, relative to the core projection estimates.\n\n\f62    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nStress scenarios: Slower growth in the North and \nthe alleviation of global imbalances\n\nGiven the importance of demand from the North as the ultimate driver \nof factory Asia\u2019s production network and the ramifications this has for \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s intraregional trade, the following question arises: How \ndoes stronger South\u2013South trade hold up against slower growth in the \nNorth? \n\nThe plunge in the industrial economies\u2019 demand for exports from \n\nthe developing world during the recent crisis raised the need for \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s economies to become more self-reliant and to adopt \npolicies that broaden the scope and structure of their openness to \ntrade and capital flows. To gradually shift developing Asia\u2019s supply and \ndemand structures toward Southern and intraregional markets, however, \nfar-reaching structural and macroeconomic adjustments are needed. On \nthe supply side, for example, it has been argued that the value chains of \nPRC-centered international production networks have to overcome issues \nof production and product specificity as well as adjust their physical and \nhuman infrastructure to the new structure of demand (ADB, 2010b). On \nthe demand side, in turn, household consumption has to be stimulated by \ntransferring corporate saving to households and reducing precautionary \nsaving (ADB, 2009). \n\nThe simulation framework adopted here is suitable neither for \n\nexploring these issues in their full complexity nor for drawing \nimplications for developing Asia and the South more broadly. But to \nroughly gauge the implications for South\u2013South trade of a weakening of \ndemand from the North, the following stress scenario is tested: suppose \nthe rates of growth of GDP and capital flows in the North are reduced by \none-third compared with the core projection and, as a consequence, the \nSouth slows down by half the North\u2019s rate.\n\nThe results of the simulation exercise indicate that the South would be \n\nunable to simply rely on its higher growth momentum and, in turn, the \nshare of South\u2013South trade would not expand. Clearly, unless the South \nfully makes up for the lower demand from the North, it is likely that the \ndynamism and viability of factory Asia would come under stress. \n\nA second stress test explores an issue related to the South\u2019s reliance \non the North, namely, the gradual reduction in North\u2013South imbalances. \nTo the extent that South\u2013South trade grows as a share of total trade, some \nof the largest imbalances at the bilateral level along North\u2013South lines \ncan be expected to fall. By the same token, imbalances among Southern \nregions are likely to widen, particularly if the commodity composition of \ninterregional South\u2013South trade remains largely unaltered and demand \nfor Asia\u2019s manufactures exports continues to expand.\n\nAgain, the full implications cannot be explored within the simulation \n\nenvironment employed. To assess the robustness of South\u2013South trade \nagainst global imbalances, the following two assumptions are imposed: \nboth the PRC surplus and United States deficit are eliminated by 2030; \nand global growth rates are unaffected by the trade rebalancing. \n\nLeaving the other assumptions from the core baseline unaltered and \n\naccommodating changes in the trade balance by allowing saving rates \nto decline in the PRC and increase in the United States, the simulation \n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    63\n\nresults suggest that, even under such extreme assumptions of complete \nexpenditure switching in the PRC and a dramatic increase in the saving \nrate in the United States, the overall pattern of the main findings does \nnot change. Most importantly, the South\u2019s share in global trade almost \ndoubles as it did in the core baseline projection. \n\nThree conclusions from the simulation results\n\nFirst, the South has the potential to boost trade within the group. \nLowering barriers to South\u2013South trade, even to the levels prevailing \nin South\u2013North trade, could bring three-quarters of the gains to \nSouthern countries as would flow from a freeing of all countries\u2019 goods \ntrade. The share of South\u2013South trade in world trade would expand by \n6.1 percentage points, or about one-quarter, compared with the core \nprojection.\n\nSecond, to benefit the South as a whole, regional initiatives should be \n\ninclusive and eventually extend market access to other countries on an \nMFN basis. For example, it was shown that if an ASEAN+6 bloc were to \ntrade freely on an MFN basis, this could generate for Asia almost half of \nwhat would accrue to the region if the whole world so liberalized. South\u2013\nSouth trade would rise by 2.3 percentage points, or almost one-tenth, as a \nresult.\n\nThird, growth in the North and demand from that region will \n\ncontinue to play an important role for the South. This is particularly the \ncase for developing Asia and its trade within the region, given that the \nfinal outputs of its production networks are still largely geared toward \nthe North. A progressive shift of supply and demand structures toward \nincreased regional demand will take time for Asia to accomplish, and \nuntil then the viability of factory Asia will continue to be linked to the \nvicissitudes of the North, albeit to a lesser and lesser extent as South\u2013\nSouth economic integration advances. \n\nSummary\nSouth\u2013South trade has expanded rapidly during the past two decades, \nwith its share of merchandise trade rising from about 7% in 1990 to 17% \nin 2009. The main determinants of this trend have been the emerging \neconomies\u2019 strong growth performance and rising share of world \nGDP, the rise of fragmented-production and trade networks, and the \nprogressive dismantling of trade barriers. \n\nAs the leading proponent of international production networks in the \n\nSouth, developing Asia has been the main driver of South\u2013South trade. \nThe region as a whole now accounts for about three-quarters of the trade \namong Southern countries (although by and large the flows are confined \nwithin developing Asia).\n\nThe PRC alone accounts for about 40% of this intra-South traffic \n\nin goods. In large part, this share reflects the PRC\u2019s pivotal role as \nthe last-stage assembly hub of the parts and components production \nnetworks referred to as factory Asia, the final output of which is exported \npredominantly to the affluent markets of the North.\n\nAt roughly one-quarter of South\u2013South trade, the combined share of \nLatin America, Africa, and the Middle East is small. Since 2000, however, \n\n\f64    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nthese regions\u2019 trade with the South has been expanding at an average \nannual rate of 26%\u2014faster than Asia\u2019s 23%.\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s trade with the other regions of the South has \nincreased markedly during the past two decades. Of developing Asia\u2019s \nimports from the South, almost 80% was attributable to the PRC. Mainly \nconsisting of primary commodities, these imports were used to fuel the \ncountry\u2019s economic expansion. In turn, the PRC\u2019s manufactures exports \nwere increasingly absorbed by growing demands from Latin America, \nAfrica, and the Middle East. \n\nAlthough global trade as a whole stands to gain from further \n\nreductions of tariffs and other barriers to trade, which tend to be higher \nin the South, an abiding policy focus on lowering these remaining hurdles \nwill spur South\u2013South trade especially. \n\nAverage tariff levels in the South have come down dramatically \nover the past two decades, but they are still much higher than those \nin the North. Moreover, tariffs faced by exporters from the South are, \non average, higher in the South than they are in the North. Logistics \nperformance of the South, as measured in its various dimensions by the \nWorld Bank, has shown significant improvement since 2007; it is still not \nup to par, though, with the North. \n\nThere is therefore scope for developing Asia and other developing \nregions to deepen trade integration and further increase the volume \nof South\u2013South trade through a gradual clearing of the remaining \nbottlenecks. Simulation analysis suggests that lowering tariff barriers to \nSouth\u2013South trade even to just the levels prevailing in South\u2013North trade \ncould bring three-quarters of the gains to Southern countries as would \nbe generated by the global elimination of tariff barriers, and South\u2013South \ntrade would expand as a result.\n\nHowever, trade reforms in support of South\u2013South trade must not \ncome at the expense of continuing broader global integration. In view of \nthe proliferation of regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere, it is \nincreasingly important that the terms and conditions of future accords be \nmade as broad-based and inclusive as possible, as well as consistent with \nWTO provisions. A comparison of Asia\u2019s North\u2013South FTAs with their \nSouth\u2013South counterparts reveals that the former are generally more \ncompatible with WTO and other global rules (Box 2.2.2). Continuing \nits policy of open regionalism and ensuring that future FTAs are \ncomprehensive and compatible with global rules are two strategies that \noffer Asia a promising path to take toward freer trade.\n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    65\n\nExpanding South\u2013South \neconomic links through \ninvestment\n\nAttracted by the PRC\u2019s opening up to investment in 1978 and, \nin particular, by the establishment of export-processing zones \nin the country\u2019s coastal provinces, FDI spurred the PRC\u2019s rise as \na world trade powerhouse. In turn, this spawned FDI-financed \ninternational production networks (which have the PRC as the \nhub of last-stage assembly of the final product) throughout \ndeveloping Asia. The volume of investment for these networks \nintensified after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s as the \nnetworks expanded and became more intricate and fragmented. \nRecently, interregional FDI flows in the South have become \nmore significant as well, with developing Asia\u2019s emergence as an \nFDI exporter to Latin America and Africa. \n\nA measure of foreign ownership of productive assets (such \n\nas factories, mines, and land), FDI is a far more important \nsource of capital to developing Asia than other types of \nforeign investment. Over the last two decades, FDI inflows to \ndeveloping\tAsia\thave\taveraged\t$187\tbillion\ta\tyear,\twhile\tthe\t\ncombined flows of portfolio and bank investment have averaged only \n$126\tbillion\ta\tyear.\tAmong\tthe\tregions\tof\tthe\tSouth,\tdeveloping\tAsia\t\nreceives the largest inflows of FDI, far exceeding those to Africa, Latin \nAmerica, or the Middle East (Figure 2.3.1).\n\nFor the South as a group, FDI is important as it is a net inflow, \nwhereas portfolio investment, for instance, is a net outflow. Moreover, \nFDI in the South has proved resilient to external shocks. Compared \nwith portfolio and bank investment, both FDI inflows to and \noutflows from the South have tended to be more stable. \n\nIndeed, net FDI inflows have been persistently large and \n\npositive over the last two decades, even with the financial \ncrises that hit the South in the 1990s, the collapse of the IT \nbubble in the early 2000s, and the recent global financial crisis. \nIn contrast, portfolio and bank flows have been much more \nvolatile, their direction switching rapidly in response to shocks \n(Figure 2.3.2).\n\nThese attributes were validated during the global financial \ncrisis. Outward FDI from the South was less affected than that \nfrom the North. In 2008, global outward FDI contracted by \naround 15%, while the PRC\u2019s outward FDI nearly doubled. And \nFDI inflows to developing Asia in 2009 remained relatively \nhigh, even though its rate of growth slowed.\n\nHistorically, FDI flows from the capital-abundant North \n\nhave proved beneficial to their Southern recipients in that \nthey brought advanced technology and filled investment gaps. \n\n2.3.1  Average net capital flows to the South, by type\nPortfolio\n\nForeign direct \nBank \n\nFinancial derivatives\nOther sector investment\n\n$ billion, 1990\u22122009\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nAfrica\n\nLatin \nAmerica\n\nMiddle \nEast\n\nSource: ADB calculations based on data from International Monetary Fund. \nInternational Financial Statistics online database; and Directorate-General of \nBudget, Accounting and Statistics.

There are two reasons for this. Increasingly, \nSouthern-owned multinational corporations are expanding \ntheir areas of operation, seeking efficiency gains and \nmarket opportunities globally, and state-owned enterprises \nand sovereign funds with abundant finance are seeking \nresources abroad. Although the magnitudes of these \ninvestments are still small relative to flows from the North, \ntheir significance and implications for the South cannot be \noverlooked.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, South\u2013South FDI stands out for \n\nthree reasons: being generally less capital intensive than \nthe North\u2019s and more suited to conditions in the South, it \nmay be easier to set up even in low-income countries, thereby \nincreasing employment and income levels. It may also be more \nstable and resilient to economic crisis. And its volume is an \nindicator of financial integration of economies of the South.\n\nStylized facts about South\u2013South links\n\nThe emergence of the South as a source of foreign direct \ninvestment\n\nFDI has seen a dramatic expansion across the globe over the \nlast two decades.  Total stocks of world FDI surged by a factor \nof\talmost\tnine,\tfrom\t$2.1\ttrillion\tin\t1990\tto\t$19\ttrillion\tby\t2009.\t\nThis trend reflects the continuing integration of the world \neconomy, which is facilitating the flow of foreign capital and \nfunds, as well as expediting transfers of technology, skills, and \njob opportunities.\n\nFor Northern economies, the outward FDI stock is far larger \n\nthan its inward stock, while the converse is true for developing \nAsia. This confirms, on the one hand, the North\u2019s role as a net \ncapital exporter and implies, on the other, that developing Asia \npresents attractive investment opportunities (Table 2.3.1).\n\nThe PRC is becoming increasingly important as both a \nrecipient and sender of FDI. Historically, Hong Kong, China \nand Singapore, the two regional financial centers of developing \nAsia, were also its largest players in both inward and outward \nFDI. Since 2006, however, the PRC has received more FDI than \nSingapore. Indeed, in the last 5 years, the PRC\u2019s inward FDI \nstock\taveraged\t$349\tbillion\ta\tyear\u2014an\tamount\tfar\tlarger\tthan\t\nJapan\u2019s as well as those of the 27 countries in the eurozone and \nof the leading economies of Latin America and Africa. And \nwhile the PRC still lags behind Singapore as a sender of FDI, it \nhas now surpassed Brazil in this respect.\n\n2.3.1  Inward and outward FDI stocks, 5-year average, \nselected economies, $ billion\n\nRegion/Country\n\nOutward FDI\n\nInward FDI\n\n1990\u201394 2005\u201309 1990\u201394 2005\u201309\n\nIndia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nASEAN-10\nDeveloping Asia\n\nBrazil\nSouth Africa\n\nJapan\nUnited States\nEU27\n\n0.2\n9.7\n2.7\n5.3\n\n42.3\n17.2\n\n243.3\n9,06.8\n44.6\n\n44.1\n120.8\n34.2\n57.9\n\n129.8\n53.7\n\n560.0\n4,158.0\n300.0\n\n2.3\n43.9\n8.7\n10.8\n\n47.9\n10.7\n\n101.4\n348.6\n58.0\n50.7\n\n280.0\n94.1\n\n14.8\n686.2\n39.3\n\n149.0\n3,076.2\n248.1 \n\nNote: For ASEAN-10, developing Asia, and EU27, values are averages for the \nregion.\nSource: ADB calculations based on data from UNCTADstat. http://www.\nunctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intltemID=1584&lang=1 (accessed \n25 February 2011).\n\n2.3.3  Growth of outward and inward FDI stocks, selected \neconomies\nOutward \n\nInward \n\n%, 2005\u221209 over 1990\u221294 \n6\n\nIndia\n\nPeople's \nRep. of \nChina\n\nASEAN-\n10\n\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nJapan\n\nUnited \nStates\n\nEU27\n\nNote: Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 10 comprises Brunei \nDarussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\nSource: ADB calculations based on data from UNCTADstat. http://www.unctad.\norg (accessed 25 February 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2.3.4  Shares of inward and outward FDI stocks for the South\n\nAfrica\n\nLatin America\n\nMiddle East\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nIn GDP \n(2009)\n\nIn capital\nstock (2007)\n\nIn GDP \n(2009)\n\nIn capital\nstock (2007)\n\n------ Inward FDI stock ------\n\n------ Outward FDI stock ------\n\nNote: Capital stock refers to physical capital stock data constructed using the \nperpetual inventory method, which is based on aggregate investment data in \nthe Penn World Tables 6.3.3.

This is consistent with the \nnotion that developing Asia is increasingly important as an FDI \nsender. \n\nTotal outward FDI flows from developing Asian economies \n\nto all regions generally surpassed outflows from Japan after \n1995. In particular, Hong Kong, China and the PRC have \nemerged as leading sources of foreign investment. Other Asian \neconomies, specifically, Taipei,China; Singapore; and Malaysia \nhave also gained in importance, particularly after the Asian \nfinancial crisis in the late 1990s.\n\nThe significance of developing Asia as a capital exporter \nis not simply due to its rapid economic growth over the last \ndecade. Outward FDI stock normalized by either GDP or the \ncapital stock is much larger for developing Asia than for other \nregions in the South: at 30% of regional GDP, developing Asia\u2019s \noutward FDI is twice as high as those of other Southern regions; \nat 10% of its capital stock, it is three times as large.\n\nIn contrast, developing Asia\u2019s normalized inward FDI \nstock\u2014at 56% of regional GDP and 14% of capital stock\u2014is not \nas impressive. Latin America\u2019s measures are larger at 85% of \nGDP and 14.2% of capital stock. Nonetheless, the inward FDI \nstock measures generally appear to be similar across Southern \nregions (Figure 2.3.4).\n\nLarge variations exist in normalized FDI stocks among the \neconomies in developing Asia (Figure 2.3.5). For inward stocks of \nFDI, the relatively small and open economies in the Pacific stand \nout: their inward-FDI stock estimates at almost 90% of their \nGDP are far above the average for developing Asia and reflect the \neconomies\u2019 reliance on foreign capital. In contrast, many South \nAsian economies have ratios to GDP of around 10%. \n\nFor East and Southeast Asia, the subregions\u2019 averages are \ndriven up by their financial centers\u2014Hong Kong, China and \nSingapore. Its large FDI stocks notwithstanding, the PRC has a \ndisproportionately small inward FDI stock relative to its GDP or \ncapital stock, given the huge size of its economy. \n\nIn the case of outward FDI stock, Taipei,China; Malaysia; \n\nand the Republic of Korea have large stocks relative to the \nsize of their economies. In fact, they are the only economies \nin developing Asia whose outward stocks are larger than their \ninward stocks. (Another notable characteristic of these three net \nFDI exporters is the significant role played by their portfolio \nflows due largely to their deep and open financial systems.) \nExcept for these economies, normalized outward FDI stocks are \nminimal in developing Asia.\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n%\n\nOutward\n\n0\n\n100\n\n300\n\n400\n\n200\n%\n\nAFG = Afghanistan; ARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; BAN = Bangladesh; \nBHU = Bhutan; BRU = Brunei Darussalam; CAM = Cambodia; FIJ = Fiji; \nGEO = Georgia; HKG = Hong Kong, China; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; \nKAZ = Kazakhstan; KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic; KIR = Kiribati; KOR = Rep. of \nKorea; LAO = Lao People\u2019s Dem.

Success has been such that Asian FDI \nflows are no longer dominated by the traditional North\u2013South \nrelationship but are increasingly South\u2013South as well.\nHard data on South\u2013South FDI flows are scarce. \nNonetheless, balance-of-payments measures suggest that \nSouth\u2013South FDI links are particularly strong in developing \nAsia compared with other Southern regions (Box 2.3.1). In 2008, \nboth developing Asia\u2019s outward FDI stock to the South and \nthe South\u2019s inward FDI stock to developing Asia were almost \ndouble the inward FDI stock from the North to developing Asia \n(Figure 2.3.6). \n\nMoreover, the South-to-developing-Asia and the developing-Asia-to-\nthe-South FDI stocks were almost equal, in contrast to the other Southern \nregions where capital exports were not as strong. In fact, outward FDI \nfrom developing Asia of this magnitude was not observed in the 1990s. \nThat it is relatively large in 2008 implies that developing Asia fared well \n\n2.3.6  Inward and outward FDI stocks, South vs North, by \nsource and destination \nInward stock from North\nInward stock from South\n\nOutward stock to North\nOutward stock to South\n\n$ trillion, 2008\n\n$9.1\n\n$9.5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nAfrica\n\nLatin \nAmerica\n\nMiddle \nEast\nSources: ADB calculations based on data from UNCTADstat. http://www.unctad.\norg; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. http://www.\noecd.org (both accessed 25 February 2011); Lee et al.

They are the starting point \nfor estimating the size of South\u2013South FDI and the share \nof South\u2013South FDI in world FDI stocks or flows, even \nthough balance-of-payments financial flows cannot be \ndirectly linked with measures of economic activity and \nthe distinction between direct and portfolio investment is \nblurred in these accounts.\n\nMeasuring FDI based on balance-of-payments data has \nthree serious problems. First, these data magnify the role of \nfinancial centers, which are conduits of financial flows, but \nare not necessarily connected to productive activity. Top \nrecipients of FDI from Hong Kong, China and Singapore \ninclude the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda, while FDI \nfrom the PRC goes to the Cayman Islands as well. \n\nBut these types of FDI flows would almost completely \ndisappear from any measure based on economic activity \nas they often represent bookkeeping entries in corporate \naccounts, rather than \u201creal activity\u201d such as labor \nemployment, goods and services production, or physical-\nasset procurement. \n\nSecond, the distinction between direct and portfolio \ninvestment is blurred with the FDI of sovereign wealth \nfunds (SWFs). While purchases of equity shares of 10% \nor more meet the IMF definition of FDI in terms of \nextent of ownership, SWF investments tend not to be \nmotivated by standard FDI objectives such as exploiting \nthe investing firm\u2019s specific advantages (like managerial \n\nstyle or corporate culture). Rather, SWFs rarely bring \nbenefits beyond large amounts of capital; they generally do \nnot seek control of firms they invest in; and they tend to \nmove in and out of industries in pursuit of higher returns, \nmuch as private equity funds do. FDI by SWFs was a small \npart of FDI from developing countries through 2004, but \nit increased rapidly after that, reaching over $25 billion \nin 2009, or over 10% of all FDI outflows from developing \ncountries (Lipsey and Sj\u00f6holm, forthcoming).\n\nThird, in some developing and transitional economies \nmuch FDI takes the form of transactions known as \u201cround \ntripping\u201d (UNCTAD, 2006), in which domestic agents \nmove capital funds to an offshore location and then remit \nthem back as FDI to their own country. This practice \nis largely motivated by financial incentives intended \nexclusively for foreign investments and by a lack of effective \ninstitutions to intermediate the funds domestically. \n\nFor example, an estimated 25%\u201340% of the PRC\u2019s \ninward FDI comes from domestic firms round tripping \nfunds through these foreign subsidiaries, especially in Hong \nKong, China (Li, forthcoming). For the PRC, however, the \nproblem is expected to become less serious after financial \nincentives for foreign firms were removed in 2008. \n\nNonetheless, round tripping, combined with the balance-\n\nof-payments convention measuring flows and stocks of \nFDI in terms of immediate rather than ultimate beneficial \nownership of FDI assets, distorts the overall picture of the \nsize, trend, and direction of South\u2013South FDI. \n\n\famid the global financial crisis; outward FDI from developing \nAsia did not slow down as much as inward FDI to the region.\nThe factors driving South\u2013South FDI in developing Asia \nare the regional financial centers\u2014Singapore and Hong Kong, \nChina\u2014acting as intermediaries of funds from within and \noutside the region, thus amplifying intra- and interregional \nSouthern relationships. Hong Kong, China is by far the largest \nplayer in the region. \n\nBut South\u2013South links can still be observed even without \nthe large players, albeit to a lesser extent (Figure 2.3.7). In East \nAsia without the PRC and Hong Kong, China, the South lateral \nlinks are seen in the forms of outward FDI from the Republic of \nKorea and Taipei,China. In Southeast Asia excluding Singapore, \nit appears as inward FDI from the South, its magnitude \nexceeding the inward stock from the North.\n\nIn other Southern regions, inward FDI stocks outweigh \n\noutward FDI stocks, with investment from the North \nparticularly dominant in the case of Latin America. As with \ndeveloping Asia, each Southern region has one or two key \nplayers driving both lateral intraregional and vertical FDI flows. \nThese are Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, South Africa in \nAfrica, and Mexico and Brazil in Latin America.\n\nIn the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has the largest FDI stock \n\nfrom the South, which in 2008 consisted of one-third of the \ntotal inward stock from the South to the region (Figure 2.3.8). \nIn contrast, the region\u2019s outward FDI stock to the South in 2008 \nwas less than half of its inward stock from the South, with more \nthan half due to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. \nIn Africa, the South\u2013South link manifests itself in inward \nFDI as the region exports very little capital. Inward FDI stock \nfrom\tthe\tSouth\tamounted\tto\t$340\tbillion\tin\t2008,\twhile\tthe\t\noutward stock was less than a quarter of this. Major FDI \nrecipients were Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa. \nTogether, these countries accounted for almost 60% of total \ninward stock in Africa (Figure 2.3.9).\n\nThe share of Southern countries\u2019 inflows of FDI to \nAfrica rose from 18% in the late 1990s to 21% in 2000\u20132008. \nDeveloping Asia\u2019s share increased even faster, from almost 7% to \n15%. Indeed, developing Asia, the PRC in particular, rather than \nAfrica itself has been the main source of South\u2013South FDI into \nAfrican countries (Table 2.3.2).\n\nIn the case of Latin America, inward FDI stocks from the \n\nNorth, particularly from the United States and Spain, have \ndominated, with Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico receiving \nabout 80% of this stock. On the South lateral link, the pattern \nis similar to Africa\u2019s, except that the stocks are much larger: \nLatin America, excluding offshore financial centers, has mainly \ninward FDI; inward stocks are about 50% higher than, and \noutward stocks more than three times as large as, Africa\u2019s. \nMajor recipients of inward FDI stocks from the South are \nMexico, Brazil, and Chile (Figure 2.3.10). \n\nSouth\u2013South economic links    69\n\n2.3.7  Inward and outward FDI stocks, East and Southeast \nAsia, by source and destination, 2008 \n\nInward stock from North\nInward stock from South\n\nOutward stock to North\nOutward stock to South\n\n$ billion\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nEast Asia excluding \nHong Kong, China and \nPeople\u2019s Rep. of China\n\nSoutheast Asia \nexcluding Singapore\n\nSources: ADB calculations based on data from UNCTADstat. http://www.unctad.\norg; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. http://www.\noecd.org (both accessed 25 February 2011); Lee et al.

First, over half of FDI inflows to developing \nAsia appear to originate in the South and mostly from the region itself \n(UNCTAD, 2006). \n\nIndeed, the flows are concentrated in East and Southeast Asia, \n\nspurred most likely by regional integration efforts, expanding production \nnetworks, and plant relocations to lower-cost areas. Advances in transport \nand logistics as well as information and communications \ntechnologies have also created opportunities to better manage \nintegrated but fragmented production networks in developing \nAsia. Asian FDI has become more intraregional, as production \nnetworks have deepened with the success of the factory Asia \nmodel (Figure 2.3.11).\n\nColombia\n10%\n\nSecond, the FDI flows through offshore financial centers and \n\nfrom unknown sources increased their share of total inward \nFDI from 15% in 1991 to 32% in 2008. Since the North has better \nreporting systems, it seems reasonable that most such FDI flows \ncome from Southern economies. If so, about 70% of inward FDI \nstock in developing Asia can be said to originate within the \nregion (Lipsey, forthcoming). \n\nIn fact, the rise in the share of offshore financial centers and \n\nunknown sources is consistent with the growth of FDI flows \nfrom the PRC to ASEAN member states, which were negligible \nin\t2001\tbut\trose\tto\tabout\t$2.5\tbillion\tin\t2009\t(UN,\t2010).\n\nThird, evidence from seven economies in developing Asia (the \nPRC; Hong Kong, China; India; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; \nTaipei,China; and Thailand), which account for more than 70% \nof the region\u2019s total FDI and have detailed data for 2005\u20132009 \n(only for inward FDI for India and the Republic of Korea), \nsupports the increasing significance of intraregional FDI. About \n40% of outward FDI from these economies flowed to developing \nAsia, while 37% of inward FDI to these countries originated in \ndeveloping Asia (Figure 2.3.12). In contrast, the North\u2019s share of \ninward FDI to these economies was only about 27%.\n\nFourth, when the sources of inward FDI to each of these \nseven countries are considered, it appears that intraregional \nFDI inflows are particularly significant for Hong Kong, China \nand for the PRC (Figure 2.3.13). As for the destinations of \noutward FDI from the five economies (that is, without India \nand the Republic of Korea), the data suggest that, while all \nof them invest substantially within the region, the flows are \nconcentrated in Hong Kong, China, Thailand, and the PRC.\n\nFifth, while the share of FDI from the North has declined \n\nin general, the North still maintains a relatively important \npresence in some economies in developing Asia, such as the \nRepublic of Korea and Taipei,China. This is consistent with the notion \nthat the investments from the North tend to need highly skilled workers \nand to be in more capital-intensive sectors, where these relatively high-\nincome economies in the region have a comparative advantage.\n\nTable 2.3.2  Major Southern investors in \nAfrica, FDI inflows, 2006\u20132008 ($ million)\n\nSouth Africa\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nMalaysia\nIndia\nTaipei,China\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nSource: UN (2010).\n\n2,609\n\n2,528\n611\n332\n48\n45\n\n2.3.10  Latin America\u2013South inward and outward FDI stocks, \nby country, 2008 \n\nLatin America\u2212South\n\nPeru\n4%\n\nOthers \n21%\n\nColombia\n5%\n\nOthers\n6%\n\nArgentina\n10%\n\nChile\n12%\n\nBrazil\n23%\n\nMexico\n30%\n\nChile\n12%\n\nMexico\n13%\n\nBrazil\n54%\n\nInward FDI stock from the South \n($475 billion)\n\nOutward FDI stock to the South\n($259 billion) \n\nSources: ADB calculations based on data from UNCTADstat. http://www.unctad.\norg; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. http://www.\noecd.org (both accessed 25 February 2011); Lee et al.

The literature offers at least three \nhypotheses. First, FDI may be motivated by the search for \nstrategic natural resources. Firms with capital, technology, and \naccess to markets undertake outward FDI to take control of \nimmobile factors in host countries, such as oil and minerals, to \nsecure supplies of raw materials or develop alternative supply \nsources as a hedge against shortages or price increases. \n\nSecond, FDI may be induced by the search for efficiency \n\ngains. Firms seek lower-cost locations or opportunities for \nexploiting scale economies in production. An economy with an \novervalued currency, for instance, may cause firms to consider \nother locations to maintain their international competitiveness. \nThird, FDI may be prompted by the search for markets. \nFirms undertake market-seeking FDI to exploit opportunities \nin host countries, particularly those with large markets and \nhigh incomes. Others do so to optimize returns on new \ntechnologies or marketing techniques that they have developed.\nThe anecdotal evidence is consistent with these motivations. \n\nFDI in natural resources was an early form of North-to-South \ndirect investment. The North had capital, technology, and \naccess to markets that the South host countries lacked. Thus \nthe Netherlands invested in oil in the Middle East and the \nUnited Kingdom invested in tea plantations in Africa and \nSouth Asia. Similarly, the PRC has long invested in oil and \nother commodity industries in many countries\u2014a trend that \nhas intensified lately in Latin America and Africa. And this \nis because the PRC, relative to African host countries, has the \ncapital, technology, and access to markets for these investments.\n\nIn the case of the Republic of Korea\u2019s multinational companies, their \ninvestments throughout developing Asia were apparently undertaken to \ntake advantage of cheap labor (efficiency-enhancing), and to penetrate \nlocal markets (market-seeking). Lee et al. (forthcoming) also argue that \nthese firms have increasingly engaged in outward FDI in part because of \npush factors, such as rapidly rising nominal wages and frequent labor-\nmanagement conflicts at home\u2014in other words, for efficiency gains and \nto maintain competitiveness.\n\nFDI from the North and the South may have somewhat different \nemphases, however. Fung et al. (2002) contend that investments from \nHong Kong, China and Taipei,China are efficiency-seeking, sensitive \nto infrastructure conditions and labor costs, whereas investments from \nJapan are market- and resource-seeking, focused on labor quality (skilled \nlabor is a scarce resource and is a complement to advanced technology). \nIn the same vein, Brooks and Hill (2004) claim that most Singaporean \nfirms investing overseas, including the PRC, are actually high value-\nadded manufacturers or service providers (seeking skilled labor to \ncomplement new technology).\n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    73\n\nA variation on the motivations may explain the investment of \nSouthern firms in the North. South-to-North FDI can be intended to \nacquire brands with established markets and technologies of production, \ndistribution, and advertising that are unavailable in the South.\n\nBut FDI may be influenced by other factors as well. For instance, \nSingaporean investment in East and Southeast Asia was motivated in part \nby personal relations the firms had with local partners and customers. \nIn some host countries, such as the PRC and Malaysia, ethnicity and \nsocial connections played a role for Singaporean investment as well. In \nthe PRC, the drivers of FDI evolved over time as policy and the business \nenvironment became more conducive to foreign investment (Box 2.3.2).\n\nIn addition, other factors, such as the state of financial development, \n\nthe quality of institutions, or the investment climate, can be crucial \ndeterminants of FDI flows. A financially deep market provides firms with \naccess to capital for undertaking cross-border investment. Although it is \nwell recognized that the banking sector is the primary source of funds \nfor investors in developing countries, Brooks and Jongwanich (2010) \nmaintain that financial depth in terms of stock and bond markets has \nbegun to play a role in financing cross-border transactions in developing \nAsia as well.\n\n2.3.2  Factors that influence inward foreign direct investment in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nWhen the PRC opened up to investment in 1978, most \nFDI inflows came from Hong Kong, China. As financial \nintegration progressed in the 1980s, multinational \ncorporations from all over the world started to invest in \nthe PRC\u2014a trend that accelerated in the late 1990s, taking \ninward FDI to $45.5 billion in 1998.\n\nIn the PRC, policies to attract inward FDI were adopted \n\nand conducive conditions promoted. The international \nproduction networks constitute a case in point. The PRC \nestablished export processing zones soon after it liberalized \ninvestment. Within the zones, enterprises could import \nparts and components for assembly without duty\u2014a policy \nthat was later extended to all special economic zones \nin the southeastern provinces. FDI with labor-intensive \ntechnology, particularly in electronics, textiles, and apparel, \ncame in to take advantage of the country\u2019s cheap labor.\nThe PRC\u2019s export and trade surplus grew in tandem \nwith the increasing FDI inflows. Though the employment \nshare of these foreign-invested enterprises is a minuscule \n5% and their contribution to the PRC\u2019s GDP is only \n3%\u20136%, their share of combined imports and exports \nreaches almost 55%.\n\nIn the past, most inward FDI consisted of greenfield \n\ninvestment. Most parent companies also created new \nlong-term jobs locally. However, in the late 1990s to early \n2000s, the share of mergers and acquisitions surged due to \nderegulation of such activity in the PRC and the entry of \n\nmore investors from the North who were less inclined to \nstart from scratch.\n\nThe PRC remains attractive to market-seeking FDI, \nbut the coastal region has become less attractive to labor-\nintensive, efficiency-seeking FDI from Southern economies \nbecause of rising costs of production. Some low-end, \nexport-oriented manufacturing activities have therefore \nshifted from coastal areas to other developing Asian \ncountries. Efficiency-seeking FDI in coastal provinces has \nbeen upgrading to high-end products, and market-seeking \nFDI has been increasingly targeting inland regions. \n\nFrom the mid-2000s, given the abundant liquidity in the \ncountry, doubts about the desirability of foreign investment \nhave been voiced in the PRC. The inward FDI stock in the \nPRC is by no means large relative to the economy\u2019s size \nat about 10% of GDP, or 2% of the capital stock. Yet the \nslowing of inward FDI growth signals a possible policy shift \nto curbing competition from foreign-owned firms.\n\nTo avoid foreign monopoly power in some strategic \n\nsectors and to reduce dependence on inward FDI \nfor economic growth, the FDI policy may be limited \nto investment in areas where the PRC needs foreign \ncapital and associated know-how, such as high-tech and \nenvironmental industries. \n\nSource\n\nLi (forthcoming).\n\n\f74    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nThe micro view\n\nAt the industry or firm level of analysis, the rationale for FDI can \narise from the many possible sources of differences, such as industry \ncomposition, average size, and labor or capital intensity, which affect the \nproductivity and spillover or \u201ctechnology-diffusing\u201d effects of investment. \nTraditionally, microeconomic analysis of FDI focuses on productivity \nimprovements in the host economy, not merely because FDI adds to the \ncapital stock, but more important because it augments human capital, \nenhances productivity, and generates spillovers to local firms.\n\nSpillover effects from foreign investment are hypothesized to be \nmultifaceted. The entry of multinational companies can reduce the \nmonopolistic power of local firms and improve market efficiency. \n\nIt can also improve production efficiency and enhance economic \ngrowth by clearing bottlenecks to investment; introduce new know-how \nby bringing in new products, production and marketing techniques (with \ntheir concomitant demonstration effects, and by training workers who \nlater become employees in local firms); transfer techniques on inventory \nmanagement and quality control; and force local firms to upgrade \nmanagerial quality, intensify managerial effort, or adopt the marketing \ntechniques used by multinational companies, either in domestic markets \nor internationally. \n\nIn turn, the more intense competition between such companies and \nlocal firms, as well as the demonstration and learning-by-doing effects \nof new production methods, lead to higher economywide productivity. \nIndeed, this is precisely why many countries offer special incentives to \nforeign enterprises, including lower income taxes or income tax holidays \nand import duty exemptions.\n\nSpillover effects are not as readily apparent for North\u2013North and \n\nSouth\u2013South (lateral) FDI as they are for North-to-South (vertical) \nflows. Although only a few analyses exist on Southern lateral flows, the \nconsensus is that South\u2013South FDI generates weak spillover effects at best \n(from intermediate-input imports and higher labor employment rates). In \ncontrast, for vertical investment, local firms seem to benefit more from \nNorthern technology (Box 2.3.3).\n\nOutward foreign direct investment from \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nDecomposition of recent FDI flows to and originating from the \nPRC suggests that Hong Kong, China and offshore financial \ncenters are the PRC\u2019s dominant partners for both inward and \noutward FDI, with a combined average share of 61% for inward \nand 76% for outward FDI during 2005\u20132009. Hong Kong, \nChina\u2019s role has steadily increased, while that of the offshore \nfinancial centers has diminished somewhat since the onset \nof the global crisis. Outside these two partners, popular \ndestinations of PRC investment funds include economies in the \nNorth, the rest of developing Asia, and Africa (Figure 2.3.14).\n\n2.3.14  Inward and outward FDI flows, by source and \ndestination, People\u2019s Republic of China \nDeveloping Asia excluding Hong Kong, China\nHong Kong, China\nOffshore financial centers\n\nNorth\nLatin America\n\nOther South\nAfrica\n\n% share, 2005\u221209 average\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nInward\n\nOutward\n\nNote: Offshore financial centers comprise Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, \nCayman Islands, and Panama.\nSources: ADB estimates based on data from CEIC Data Company (accessed \n25 February 2011); Li (forthcoming). \nClick here for figure data\n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    75\n\n2.3.3 How do North\u2013South and South\u2013South foreign direct investment compare in industry distribution, \nproductivity, and spillovers?\n\nA few case studies1 on developing Asia show industry, \nsize, and productivity differences between Southern and \nNorthern plants. FDI from sources in the South tends to \nbe a major presence in textiles and apparel; food; wood \nand paper products; and rubber products. Firms from \nthe North tend to be dominant in chemicals, transport \nequipment, and some types of machinery. \n\nAlthough these are rather wide industry categories, it \nis fairly safe to characterize the second group of industries \nas being more capital-intensive and more technology-\nintensive than those of the first group.\n\nSize characteristics, as measured by output and \n\nemployment per plant, regardless of industry, show that \nplants with Northern owners are much larger than those \nwith Southern owners from, for example, Hong Kong, \nChina; Malaysia; Singapore; and Thailand. Since plant \nsizes differ widely by industry, and clothes factories are \ntypically much smaller than those of auto plants, these \ndifferences reflect the industry distributions mentioned \nabove. Margins are larger for output per plant than for \nemployment per plant, pointing to productivity differences \nin addition to the industry mix. \n\nDo these industry distribution and size differentials \n\npoint to distinct differences in productivity between \nforeign-owned and locally owned plants? \n\nIn an Indonesian case study, labor productivity in plants \n\nrepresenting FDI from the North (Japan) was found to be \nsignificantly higher than in plants representing FDI from \nthe South in a broad set of industries (Box figure). The \nexceptions to this pattern were foods, textiles, and wood/\nfurniture\u2014industries in which FDI from the South were a \nmajor presence.\n\nIn the two cases of Hong Kong, China and Singapore, \n\ncompared with plants owned by Southern firms, those \nowned by Northern firms reported higher productivity of \nclose to 20% (in Hong Kong, China) and of more than half \nfor United States- and European-owned plants and close to \na third for Japanese-owned plants (in Singapore).\n\nAn issue of interest to host FDI countries concerns \n\nthe extent to which FDI technology is absorbed by \nlocal firms, which is a process referred to as spillovers \nand which comes in the form of increased competition; \ncopy-catting of foreign firms\u2019 production techniques, \n\nLabor productivitiy of foreign-owned plants \nin Indonesian manufacturing, 1997\u20132003\n\nNorth (Japan)\n\nSouth (Other Asia)\n\n$, output per worker\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1 = Total manufacturing; 2 = Paper/printing; 3 = Chemicals; \n4 = Nonmetallic minerals; 5 = Fabricated metal and \nmachinery; 6 = Other manufacturing; 7 = Food; 8 = Textiles; \n9 = Wood/furniture.\nSource: Takii (2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nproducts, and ways of doing business; and availability of a \ngreater range of products or of products of better quality. \nResults reported in studies are mixed. Countries and \nfirms differ in their ability to benefit from the presence \nof foreign-owned firms. Insignificant impacts seem to \nbe driven by the fact that Southern lateral investment is \nmainly in labor-intensive industries, which are associated \nwith relatively low productivity. This is consistent with the \nhypothesis that spillovers are larger for North\u2013South FDI \nthan for South\u2013South FDI because Northern-owned firms \nare the original owners of technology in most industries.\n\nIt may, however, be true that the less advanced \n\ntechnologies used by Southern investors are more suited \nto the conditions of the host Southern countries, such \nas labor force or management skills, levels of education, \nor local customs, and might be more easily imitated or \nlearned than those of the Northern firms. \n\nIn general, affiliates from Northern countries tend to be \n\nlarge, and can have many things to teach Southern host-\ncountry firms. But the latter may be too small to use the \ntechnologies suited to such larger affiliates. \n\n1. Such as Ramsetter (2004, 1994) on Thailand; and Takii (2011) on \nIndonesia.\n\nSource\n\nLipsey and Sj\u00f6holm (forthcoming).\n\nThe history of the PRC\u2019s outward FDI may be briefly described as \nfollows. The PRC government deregulated outward FDI in 1976, allowing \nPRC firms to establish joint ventures abroad. These were initially seen \nin Hong Kong, China, and Sudan, where the motivation was trade-\nrelated and resource-seeking. The PRC\u2019s outward FDI did not show real \nincreases, however, until 2003 when its investment in the nonfinance \n\n\f76    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nsector hit $2.9 billion and was followed by years of annual doubling until\nflows\treached\t$59.0\tbillion\tin\t2010.\n\nOutward FDI from the PRC became noticeable in 2003, or about \n3 years earlier than what Dunning\u2019s (1981, 1986) rule of thumb would \nforecast. Were this rule\u2014that a country becomes a FDI exporter only \nafter\tits\tper\tcapita\tgross\tnational\tincome\texceeds\t$2,000\u2014correct,\tonly\t\nin 2006 would the PRC have become a significant source of FDI. That \nit became so earlier is probably due to the role played by state-owned \nenterprises. From 2002 to 2003, outward FDI from the PRC increased \nfrom\t$0.98\tbillion\tto\t$2.85\tbillion,\twith\t73.5%\tof\tthe\tlatter\tamount\tdue\t\nto such enterprises. And in 2003\u20132009, they accounted for more than \n80% of the PRC\u2019s outward FDI stock and flow, with funds coming from \nhuge corporate savings. Investments from state-owned enterprises were \nprimarily resource seeking, going to energy and mining, in both North \nand South (Table 2.3.3). \n\nTable 2.3.3  Outward FDI from the People\u2019s Republic of China, by type\n\nMotivation\n\nIndustry\n\nFirms and characteristics\n\nLocation\n\nResources\n\nEnergy and resources (mining in particular) \n\nCentral state-owned enterprises\n\nWorldwide\n\nleasing and business services\n\nMarket\n\nWholesale and retail trades, \n\ntelecommunications, textiles, shoe-making, \nand car industry (labor intensive)\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises, \nexcept for a few big companies like \nHuawei and ZTE\n\nAsia, Africa, and Latin America for \n\nlocal markets\n\nEfficiency\n\nElectronics, machinery\n\nGreen (air-conditioner maker), Sany \n\nMainly south, such as Latin America \n\n(machinery manufacturer)\n\nStrategic assets\n\nSany, Gily, Lenovo, Haier\n\nEurope\n\nResearch or design center, merger with \nor acquisition of technology-intensive \ncompetitor\n\nSource: Li (forthcoming).\n\nIn contrast, outward FDI of private enterprises tended to come \n\nfrom small- and medium-size enterprises and in manufacturing. \nForeign investments by private enterprises mostly sought to penetrate \nsouthern markets in industries such as telecommunications, textiles, and \nautomobiles. Certain investments in Latin America were intended to reap \nefficiency gains through reductions in transport cost and by using local \nproduction centers as regional bases. Most investments were in labor-\nintensive industries. For example, the PRC\u2019s FDI in the South included \ninvestments in telecommunications, city-bus manufacturing, and \ninfrastructure construction. \n\nAs a result of the surge in outward FDI, the PRC has become an \nimportant source of capital and technology for neighboring, low-income \ncountries, thus promoting industrial migration. \n\nSummary and key policy messages\nThe importance of South\u2013South FDI is rising. While the majority \nof global outward FDI flows and stocks still originate in industrial \neconomies, developing economies are emerging as important sources of \noutward FDI, with their share reaching 20% of the global total. Because of \nits high growth profile and accumulating financial resources, developing \n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    77\n\nAsia is becoming a major player in this trend, accounting for more than \n70% of outward FDI stock from developing countries. Indeed, the region\u2019s \nsignificance was highlighted by the resilience of outflows from developing \ncountries during the global financial crisis, in contrast to those coming \nfrom the North.\n\nOver the past two decades, Asian FDI has become more intraregional \n\nas, driven by the success of factory Asia, international production \nnetworks have deepened. More than half of total FDI inflows to \ndeveloping Asia are estimated to originate in the region. Recent evidence \nfrom seven economies of developing Asia (the PRC; Hong Kong, China; \nIndia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Taipei,China; and Thailand) \nindicates that about 40% of their combined outward FDI (excluding India \nand the Republic of Korea) were directed to the region, while 37% of their \ninward FDI flows originated in the region.\n\nEnterprises invested with foreign capital are known to introduce \nnew products or technology and to enhance the quality of the labor \nforce in the host economy. The evidence that South\u2013South FDI does this, \nhowever, is mixed at best. To maximize the benefits of inward FDI, host \neconomies ought, therefore, to design and adopt investment policies such \nthat positive externalities are generated for both local firms and the labor \nforce. More specifically, continued efforts should be made to improve the \nbusiness environment, upgrade labor skills, foster technology transfer, \nand integrate FDI firms into local economies. In addition, policy makers \nin host economies should periodically scrutinize the effectiveness of trade \npolicy to ensure that industries are not overprotected and that regulations \nare not constraining growth.\n\nDeveloping Asia is playing an increasingly important role in filling \n\nthe investment needs of other countries inside and outside the region \nand, in turn, improving the productive capacity of industries in those \ncountries. Prospectively, outward FDI from the high-saving countries \nof developing Asia can also help to address the global current account \nimbalance to the extent that savings are invested in Southern countries \nrather than in low-risk assets in the North. \n\nNorthern FDI\u2019s strong suits\u2014association with more advanced \n\ntechnologies and more effective management styles\u2014remain \nindispensable. Northern and Southern FDI complement rather than \nsubstitute. Moreover, the low FDI-to-capital-stock ratio of many \neconomies in developing Asia suggests that the quality of the capital \nstock (with implications for technology and other spillovers) can be vastly \nimproved, which can best be addressed by Northern sources of capital.\nCountries in developing Asia should therefore continue to promote \ninvestment-friendly policies to attract more FDI. These strategies include \nimproving the investment climate to attract foreign capital in a broader set \nof industries; developing the finance sector, particularly equity and bond \nmarkets to facilitate flows of funds; and promoting capital-account openness.\n\n\f78    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nWider economic links for \ndevelopment\n\nSouth\u2013South economic links go beyond trade and investment. Labor \nmovement and remittances, knowledge sharing, and macroeconomic \npolicy coordination are other channels through which developing \neconomies are benefiting from closer ties. For knowledge sharing and \npolicy coordination, a wide range of cooperative activities is carried out \neach year, but their extent is unclear as systematic monitoring is lacking.\n\nLabor movement and remittances\nJust as globalization has opened up markets for goods and capital, so it \nhas for labor. Freer cross-border movement of people has allowed labor \nmarkets of different countries to be more closely integrated. People \nare on the move, the streams reflecting divergences in circumstances \nand opportunities, which results in more efficient allocation of global \nresources. Out-migration from labor-surplus economies increases labor \nproductivity; in-migration to labor-scarce countries provides either cheap \nor highly demanded labor. Ultimately, labor movements contribute to \neconomic growth all round.\n\nIndustrial countries of the North remain the most sought-after \ndestinations of migrant workers. But the economic success of the South \nhas created rising demand for both unskilled workers and highly skilled \nprofessionals\u2014the former to produce manufactures cheaply or provide \nlow-skilled services, and the latter to complement new technology. \nLabor flows within the South accelerated in the early 1970s when the \nMiddle East started attracting thousands of workers from Asia for \nconstruction work and domestic service as a result of the oil price \nboom. \n\nIn particular, the workers came from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, \n\nPakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. More recently, \nEast and Southeast Asia have become major destinations for \nAsian workers, with their export-led model of development. \nNotable host countries in these subregions include the newly \nindustrialized economies of Hong Kong, China; the Republic \nof Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China, as well as emerging \neconomies of Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nAmong migrant settlers, North\u2013North migrants constitute \nthe largest group (Figure 2.4.1). This possibly reflects the freer \nlabor movements within Europe and the North in general. \nNorth-to-developing Asia migrants make up the second-\nlargest group. This may well stem from Asia\u2019s rising economic \nimportance. Interestingly, for each region of the South, more \nemigrants relocate to the North than intraregionally. Outside \nthe North, interregional migration from the South seems \ninsubstantial. This trend may be indicative of physical, policy, \n\n2.4.1  Stock estimates of migrants, 2010 \n\nNorth\nLatin America \n\nAfrica\nDeveloping Asia\n\nMiddle East\n\nMillions\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nLatin \nAmerica \n\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nMiddle \nEast\nSource: World Bank.

This is because, \non the one hand, host countries require immigrants to have \nrelevant skills and, on the other, countries of origin want to \nlimit the brain drain, while simultaneously protecting the rights \nof their workers abroad. To ensure that labor movements are \nmutually beneficial, coordinated policies are needed.\n\nGrowing migration has gone hand in hand with rising flows of \nremittances, which contribute to the economic growth of recipient \ncountries and provide an additional source of funds for their receiving \nhouseholds. A majority of the top 10 remittance-receiving countries in the \nworld (India, the PRC, Mexico, the Philippines, Bangladesh, \nand Nigeria) are in the South, with developing Asia accounting \nfor the lion\u2019s share of the total flows. Indeed, the rates of \ngrowth of remittance inflows to developing Asia are higher \nthan those flowing into other parts of the South.\n\nTotal remittance inflows to all developing countries \naveraged\taround\t$315\tbillion\tannually\tin\tthe\t3\tyears\tto\t2010\t\n(Figure 2.4.3). The great bulk of these inflows went to middle-\nincome countries, particularly to developing Asia, which \nreceived\taround\t$170\tbillion\tof\tthese\tflows\ton\tan\tannual\tbasis\t\nin the last few years. As a share of GDP, remittance receipts \nwere especially important in Asia for Tajikistan, Nepal, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, as well as \nfor several Pacific island countries.\n\nAlthough North\u2013South transfers of workers\u2019 remittances account for \n\nclose to 45% of global flows, South\u2013South transfers have also grown in \nimportance. The economic resilience of the South manifested itself in the \nrising share of South\u2013South remittances\u2014from 18% in 2005 to 25% in \n2010 (Figure 2.4.4). \n\nIn contrast, the North\u2013North share declined from about \n\n34% to 29% over the same period. As the major remittance-\nsending countries were hit by the global crisis, the growth in \nremittance flows slowed, but the flows to each Southern region \ngenerally did not decline. Indeed, the flows to developing Asia \nare apparently reverting to a higher trajectory.\n\nCountries have undertaken various cooperative policy \nmeasures to improve the efficiency of remittance procedures. \nIndeed, the cost of making such transfers through formal \nchannels has declined and led to a larger share being remitted \nthrough wire transfers, which are more easily recorded by \ncentral banks. Beyond this, tighter finance sector coordination \nwould facilitate more secure ways of making transfers, while \nimproving the accuracy of statistics on remittance flows.\n\n%\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nAfrica\n$ billion\n200\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n10\nEstimate\n\nSouth\u2013South economic links    79\n\n2.4.2  Stock estimates of migrants \n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSouth\u2013South\n\nSouth\u2013North\n\nNorth\u2013South\n\nNorth\u2013North\n\nSource: World Bank.

New opportunities for global learning across regions and \ncountries are opening up, and the sharing of development experiences \n(including through North\u2013South, South\u2013South, and triangular \ncooperation) to strengthen and broaden sources of knowledge for growth \nand development has expanded. \n\nCommensurate with the economic growth of the South, South\u2013South \n\nknowledge sharing has become an important part of international \nrelations. Indeed, South\u2013South knowledge exchange is one of the nine \npillars of the G20 Development Consensus for effective collaboration \namong developing countries on development solutions. It can be \nenhanced through triangular cooperation arrangements, where a bilateral \nor multilateral donor teams with a more advanced developing country to \nprovide lessons and advice to another developing country.\n\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC, 2008) \n\ngives examples of South\u2013South knowledge sharing. These include \ntechnical cooperation programs of various countries, such as Argentina, \nChile, Egypt, and Tunisia, as well as the PRC, India, the Republic \nof Korea, Singapore, and Thailand. It notes, however, that Southern \nmultilateral institutions play only a limited role in technical cooperation \nand that Southern bilateral development cooperation is driven mainly by \ngeographic proximity, except the PRC\u2019s. \n\nDrawing a distinction between North\u2013South and South\u2013South \ncooperation, ECOSOC observes that projects supported by Northern \ndonors focus more on social sectors, whereas Southern bilateral and \nmultilateral institutions prefer projects in hard-core infrastructure sectors \nsuch as communications, energy, and transport. \n\nFor Asia, Schulz (2010) lists numerous examples of cooperation on \n\nknowledge-sharing spanning a wide range of areas such as poverty \nreduction, sector programs, local administration, microfinance, and aid \nmanagement. The International Poverty Reduction Center, set up in 2005 \nin the PRC, promotes experience sharing with developing countries and \nassists them through training, research, and exchange events. \n\nProspectively, countries in the South can learn from each other on \n\nvarious other issues. Sharing best practices in environment-friendly \nmanagement of solid and hazardous waste, for example, can enhance \neconomic sustainability and reduce health care costs. Similarly, \nknowledge sharing on farming technology and practices that increase \nagricultural productivity, as well as on mitigating the impacts of global \nwarming on agricultural production, can improve food security.\n\nKnowledge-sharing mechanisms have mushroomed at all levels, \nbut they lack harmonization, with communication and coordination \namong the layers limited. Building a strong architecture for South\u2013South \ncooperation calls for systematically sharing these mechanisms.\n\nMacroeconomic cooperation\nCoordinating macroeconomic policies and institutional measures has \nbecome an effective means of economic cooperation. For example, G20\u2019s \nactions during the global crisis helped to synchronize fiscal and monetary \n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    81\n\nstimuli across countries. And following the return to growth of the global \neconomy, it is now focusing on how global imbalances are best addressed.\nThe recovery of the world economy underscored the value of South\u2013\nNorth macroeconomic cooperation. South\u2013South cooperation, however, is \nlikely to figure more prominently in global rebalancing initiatives. Indeed, \nproposed solutions cannot focus on United States\u2013PRC bilateral trade \nbalances alone, because many developing Asian economies also have trade \ndeficits with the PRC. Instead, coordinated exchange rate adjustments can \nmitigate the disruptive effects of, for instance, a unilateral exchange rate \nrealignment on other economies.\n\nTwo other instances of macroeconomic and institutional cooperation \ninvolve countries adopting a common economic policy. Addressing short-\nterm volatility in capital inflows by imposing temporary capital controls \ncan be harmful for a country if it acts unilaterally. But the policy may \nbe feasible if it is executed in an internationally coordinated manner. As \nmentioned in Part 1 of the Asian Development Outlook 2011, G20\u2019s plan to \nestablish practical indicative guidelines for assessing a country\u2019s current \naccount imbalances and set out principles for capital control is a useful \nstart, to which the South, particularly Asia, can provide many lessons.\n\nIn a similar vein, using the South\u2019s savings to fund regional investment \n\nprojects rather than placing them in safe assets in the North can \ncontribute to global rebalancing. But this requires deepening the regional \ncapital markets and adopting coordinated policies for capital market \nliberalization. Fortunately, regional financial institutions in the South \nhave been taking steps to integrate with global markets, develop domestic \ncapital and bond markets, and promote macroeconomic coordination.\nMany efforts at macroeconomic cooperation are under way in the \n\nSouth. In Latin America and the Caribbean, initiatives include the \nproposal to establish a cohesion fund (a structural instrument intended \nto reduce economic and social gaps and to promote regional economic \nstability) for member states of the Central American Common Market, \nand the creation of the Mercosur Structural Convergence Fund (that \nalso promotes competitiveness and social cohesion, particularly among \neconomically smaller members). \n\nIn Asia, ASEAN+3 projects consist of setting up the informal ASEAN \n\nSurveillance Process (to monitor and exchange information on financial \nand economic developments); developing Asian bond markets; adopting \nthe Economic Review and Policy Dialogue process (for exchanging views \non global, regional, and country economic development issues as well \nas on risks affecting regional economies and the options for policy); and \nestablishing\tthe\tmultilateralized\tChiang\tMai\tInitiative\t(a\t$120\tbillion\t\nreserve pool intended to provide short-term liquidity to supplement \nexisting international financial arrangements).\n\nHarnessing South\u2013South cooperation to its full \npotential\n\nSouth\u2013South cooperation initiatives can be a powerful force for \ndevelopment and change. Closer ties will facilitate better sharing of goods \nand services, knowledge and technology, and even labor resources. This \n\n\f82    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nsharing, in turn, will afford more opportunities for countries in the South \nto grow economically. Integration of regional markets through the core \nareas of trade and investment will allow a better distribution of benefits \nfrom the growth process as well. Expansion of economic relations within \ndeveloping Asia and across Southern countries will not only strengthen \nAsia\u2019s role as a driver of global growth, but also give its lagging states a \nchance to catch up with the leading ones.\n\nTo fully realize these benefits, however, the South needs to address \n\nnumerous bottlenecks\u2014including outdated laws, regulations, and \nstandards; barriers to trade; poor investment climates; low-quality \ninfrastructure; and shortages of capital and skilled labor\u2014all of which \nhamper the deepening and expansion of links among its economies. Still, \nthe fact alone that the South recognizes the challenge is a good start to \nbring back its growth to a sustainable path.\n\n\fSouth\u2013South economic links    83\n\nEndnotes\n1 The South refers to Africa, developing Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Middle East covers Bahrain, Egypt, \n\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, \n\nOccupied Palestinian territory, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syrian Arab Republic, and \n\nUnited Arab Emirates. The North is the residual.\n\n2  The impact of recent developments in North Africa and the Middle East, however, is not yet \n\n3  Data for all economies other than Taipei,China are compiled from the UN Comtrade \n\ndatabase, based on Revision 3 of the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC, \n\nRev. 3). Data for Taipei,China are obtained from the trade database of the Council for \n\nEconomic Planning and Development, Taipei,China. The data set spans from 1990 to 2009. \n\nThe reported data refer to merchandise trade, not services trade, for which a comprehensive \n\ndatabase of bilateral flows is not available. To facilitate the comparability of trade shares \n\nacross regions over time in view of sharp price fluctuations, the discussion generally refers \n\nto merchandise trade net of fuel trade (oil and gas, SITC category no. 3), unless otherwise \n\nclear.\n\nspecified.\n\n4  Although this exclusion introduces a downward bias to the share of the oil-exporting \n\nregions, it does not alter the basic conclusion on Asia\u2019s dominant role in South\u2013South trade. \n\nIn 2009, for instance, developing Asia\u2019s share in total South\u2013South merchandise trade was \n\n66% when fuel is included and 74% when fuel is excluded, and the PRC\u2019s corresponding \n\n5  While this is the case for average tariffs applied, it is also true that peak tariffs tend to be \n\nhighest in the North, especially for products of key interest to Southern exports, such as \n\nshares were 37% and 40%. \n\nfood products. \n\n6  The growth rate of non-Asian South\u2013South trade was as high as 47.2% a year on average \n\nfrom 1990\u20131991 to 2000\u20132001, although its base was very small.\n\n7  The exception is Latin America, whose South\u2013South share of exports is below that of \n\nimports. This is explained by the inclusion of Mexico in the regional aggregate. As a \n\nmember of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico sends a large share of its \n\nexports to Canadian and United States markets. When Mexico is excluded, Latin America\u2019s \n\npatterns are consistent with those of the other Southern regions. \n\n8  Based on data sourced from the Latin Business Chronicle, the US Census Bureau, and \n\nEurostat. \n\n9  People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Republic of Korea; \n\nMalaysia; Pakistan; Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam.\n\n\f84    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\n10 For a detailed description of the Logistics Performance Index, see http://info.worldbank.\n\norg/etools/tradesurvey/mode1a.asp.\n\n11 Recall, though, that the model assumes that there are no changes in agricultural trade \n\npolicies over the projection period. Perhaps more realistic scenario, especially for a rapidly \n\ngrowing Asia, is a steady rise in agricultural protection to slow the decline in food self-suffi-\n\nciency\u2014as happened over the past 50 years in the most advanced Asian economies (see, for \n\n12 In reality, some of these agreements have already been partly implemented and others, if \n\nexample, Anderson and Nelgen, 2011).\n\nimplemented, will be staggered over time.\n\n13 Although certainly indicative, the results are based on comparative static analyses that fail \n\nto capture additional dynamic gains from trade reform, which can be substantial. \n\n14 This estimated global welfare gain from freeing all of the world\u2019s merchandise trade turns \n\nout to be small both in absolute terms and compared with the welfare effect of a GDP \n\nslowdown in high-income countries. As the caveats in the next section make clear, however, \n\nthese gains from global trade reform are very much lower-bound estimates. \n\n15 The South\u2013North average tariffs for each commodity are implemented as a ceiling tariff for \n\nSouth\u2013South trade, with any bilateral tariffs already lower than these remaining unaffected \n\n(the exception predominately farm products).\n\nBackground papers\nAnderson, K., and A.

As  the  recovery  takes  hold,  the  authorities  will  need  to  wind  down  their  anticrisis \nmeasures  and  return  to  the  stronger  precrisis  fiscal  position  while  normalizing  monetary  policy.  The \noutlook  is  for  a  gradual  pickup  in  growth  on  the  assumption  that  exports,  foreign  investment,  and \nremittances  continue  to  strengthen.  Structurally,  though,  further  acceleration  of  reforms  is  crucial  for \nimproving  the  business  environment  and  boosting  the  economy\u2019s  competitiveness.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy grew very rapidly in the early years of the decade, \nunderpinned by the large inflows of foreign direct investment and \nremittances. Growth, however, plummeted in late 2008 and in 2009 \nunder the weight of the global crisis. Countercyclical fiscal and monetary \npolicies, as well as improved economic conditions around the world \nand in the Russian Federation particularly, have helped the country to \nstabilize and return to growth. GDP expanded by 2.6% in 2010, despite a \nslump in agriculture (Figure 3.1.1).\n\nAgriculture contracted by 13.4%, reflecting poor weather that \n\nseriously damaged crops across the country. This left industry (excluding \nconstruction) to be the driving force of the recovery, expanding by \n9.5%, much of which was generated by export-oriented mining and \nmetallurgy. Increased volumes of foodstuffs, drinks, and pharmaceuticals \nhelped buttress growth. Construction, which propelled high growth \nin earlier years before its collapse took down the economy by 14.2% in \n2009 (Figure 3.1.2), expanded by 3.7% in 2010, mainly due to government \nanticrisis spending.\n\nThe trade and services sector grew by 4.4%, primarily on increased \n\nservice volumes in such areas as financial, insurance and real estate \nactivities and information and communications technology.\n\nFrom the demand side, private expenditure and investment grew by \n\nan estimated 5%, reflecting the gradual recovery in global activity and \nits impact on the domestic economy.

Average annual inflation was 8.2% for the year. Items \nkeeping food inflation high were dairy, eggs, meat, and grain products, \nin that order, with price increases ranging from 18.7% to 13.1%. The higher \nfood inflation was offset by moderating nonfood inflation, mainly due \nto weakening prices in private cars, medicines, garments and knitwear, \nfootwear, detergents, and beauty items.\n\nAs inflation picked up, the central bank tightened monetary \npolicy and gradually raised its refinancing rate by 225 basis points in \nJanuary\u2013May 2010 to 7.25% and kept it there through December. Despite \nthis tightening and measures to de-dollarize the economy, the share of \nforeign currency loans in banks stayed high, increasing from 51.9% at \nend-2009 to 57.4% 12 months later, while the share of foreign currency \ndeposits fell from 73.4% to 69.0%.\n\nBroad money supply grew by 11.8% in 2010. Credit to the economy \njumped by about 28%, reflecting positive macroeconomic trends and a \nslight decline in interest rates due to allocation of funds attracted by \nbanks. The contribution of net foreign assets to monetary growth was \nnegative, mainly due to the central bank\u2019s interventions, which aimed to \nsmooth large exchange rate movements (Figure 3.1.4).\n\nFiscal policy aimed to continue supporting the recovery while \n\naddressing medium-term fiscal and debt vulnerabilities. A 14.5% increase \nin tax revenue and restrained spending have significantly eased the fiscal \nimbalance. Improvements in tax and customs administration, progress \nin introducing an electronic tax-filing system, and strengthened taxpayer \nservices (such as \u201ctaxpayer service centers\u201d) along with greater economic \nactivity boosted tax receipts. But despite climbing slightly from 16.7% \nin 2009 to 16.9%, the tax-to-GDP ratio is still low internationally. Total \nbudget revenue rose by 10%, but as a share of GDP declined from 22.9% in \n2009 to 22.2% in 2010.\n\nTotal expenditure increased by a mere 0.5% from 2009. A budget \ndeficit of 4.9% of GDP recorded in 2010 was well below the 6% of GDP \nprojected by the government in late 2009 and a sizable 7.6% recorded in \n2009 (Figure 3.1.5). About 60% of the deficit in 2010 was financed through \ndomestic resources.\n\nOutstanding public external debt climbed quickly to nearly \n\n$3.0\tbillion\tin\t2009\tand\trose\tby\tanother\t$300\tmillion\tin\t2010,\treaching\t\nabout 35.1% of GDP (Figure 3.1.6), with about 22.5% coming from central \nbank\tborrowing.\tDomestic\tpublic\tdebt\tedged\tup\tto\t$428\tmillion\tin\t2010,\t\nand is relatively small at 4.5% of GDP. Although the level of total public \ndebt is high, given that most is on concessional terms, debt service is \nmanageable. Debt projections from the International Monetary Fund \nindicate that the total debt ratio will move up to about 50% of GDP in \n2012, reflecting an increase in external borrowing, before declining to \n43.5% of GDP in 2013.\n\nWhile the public finance situation is improving, weaknesses \nremain in the balance of payments.

After tumbling by 25.0% in 2009, imports showed \ngrowth of 19.8% in 2010, boosted by domestic demand that was lifted by \nimproving investment and rebounding remittances.\n\nThe\ttrade\tdeficit\tpushed\tout\tslightly\tto\tan\testimated\t$2.3\tbillion,\tbut\t\nlarger remittances and factor income helped narrow the current account \ndeficit to 14.6% of GDP in 2010 from 16.0% (Figure 3.1.7). The large current \naccount gap was financed primarily by donor inflows and foreign direct \ninvestment.\n\nThe central bank maintains a floating exchange rate regime. Given \nthe large import content of consumption, its interventions in the foreign \nexchange market aimed to prevent steep fluctuations in the value of the \ndram while safeguarding reserves. Over the year, the nominal effective \nexchange rate appreciated by 9.7%, and the real effective exchange rate \nby 11.4%, reflecting higher inflation in Armenia than in its main trading \npartners (Figure 3.1.8).\n\nGross\tinternational\treserves\tcontracted\tby\tabout\t$150\tmillion\tto\t\n$1.8\tbillion\tat\tend-December\t2010,\tequivalent\tto\tabout\t5\tmonths\tof\t\nimport\tcover.\tThree-year\tarrangements\tequivalent\tto\t$395\tmillion\twith\t\nthe International Monetary Fund were approved in June 2010, following \na\t$540\tmillion\tstand-by\tarrangement\tapproved\tin\tMarch\t2009.\tThese\t\narrangements have helped to replenish reserves as the authorities seek to \nstrengthen the external position. Their economic program aims to restore \nfiscal and external sustainability, preserve financial stability, and support \ngrowth and poverty reduction.\n\nEconomic prospects\nContinued growth in Armenia depends heavily on that in the Russian \nFederation. Strong performance there will boost foreign direct investment \ninflows, migrants\u2019 remittances, and demand for exports. As a result of \nimproved external conditions\u2014along with a rebound in agriculture, \nwhich is expected to grow by 10% this year\u2014GDP is projected to expand \nby 4.0% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012.\n\nThe government\u2019s efforts toward diversifying the economy and \nstimulating exports will provide additional impetus to growth and \nshould make it less volatile. Investments in large-scale infrastructure, \nsuch as highways and rural roads, as well as the water-supply system, will \ncontinue to bolster public spending.\n\nFiscal policy is expected to be gradually tightened in 2011 and 2012 \ngiven concerns on the large buildup of external debt. This year\u2019s fiscal \nconsolidation should be achieved through stronger revenue collection, \nstemming from the positive economic outlook and improving tax \nadministration. The 3-year midterm spending program calls for \nsuspension of public sector salary increases up to 2013 and freezing \nspending on purchases of equipment and property. The government \nenvisages reducing the budget deficit to about 4% in 2011. The priority \nareas for expenditure include support for social programs and \ninfrastructure.\n\nDue to strengthening domestic activity and fast-rising global \n\n\f3.1.9  Current account balance\n5-year moving average\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-12\n\n-18\n\n5-year moving average\nCurrent account balance \n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 1 March 2011); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n92    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\ncommodity prices, inflation pressures will persist in 2011, though inflation \nis expected to come down from its 2010 high. Monetary policy is shifting \nto a tighter stance to combat these pressures: in February this year, the \ncentral bank increased the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points, to \n7.75%. Inflation is forecast at 7.5% in 2011 and 5.5% in 2012.\n\nRecovering remittance inflows and transfers as well as the large \ninfrastructure projects are seen boosting domestic demand for imports, \nsuch that they rise by about 12.0% in 2011 and 10.0% in 2012.\n\nGiven the expected growth in major trade partners and expected \n\noutcomes of the government\u2019s export diversification and promotion \nactions, exports are expected to expand by 15.0% in 2011 and by about \n10.0% in 2012. This increase will be backed by strengthening from \nnew investments in chemicals and metallurgy. The trade deficit is seen \nnarrowing moderately. Backed by the robust remittance inflows, the \ncurrent account deficit is forecast to ease to 13.0% of GDP in 2011 and to \n12.3% of GDP in 2012 (Figure 3.1.9).\n\nDevelopment challenges\nThe immediate to midterm macroeconomic challenges include tightening \nthe monetary and fiscal stances, ensuring debt sustainability through \nconcessional financing, and reducing external imbalances.\n\nFiscal consolidation will require action on both the revenue and \nexpenditure sides. The authorities acknowledge the need for a faster pace \nof reforms in the areas of tax and customs administration.\n\nFurther efforts for better governance will likewise be important \nto improve social policy, improve the distribution of resources, and \nreduce poverty. The government is aware of oligopolies in key sectors of \nthe economy that have strong links with entrenched elites. It therefore \nintends to continue its efforts to reduce corruption, enforce competition, \nmodernize public expenditure management, and strengthen the civil \nservice and judiciary.\n\nFor reducing reliance on minerals and metals, which account for the \nbulk of exports, the government needs urgently to take steps to diversify \nthe industrial base. A one-stop shop for business registration is set to \ncome into effect this year, which should reduce barriers to entry for new \nbusinesses.\n\n\fAzerbaijan\n\nAlthough growth in oil output slowed in 2010, higher oil prices led to a large balance-of-payments surplus, \nwhile a revival in the non-oil economy, driven by public expenditure, led to solid but slower overall growth. \nGrowth  and  the  balance  of  payments  are  both  predicted  to  remain  strong  in  2011  and  2012.  Inflation  was \nmoderate but local and external factors will stoke price pressures in 2011. Supporting growth in the non-oil \nsector  and  reducing  dependence  on  oil  revenue  represent  a  significant  long-term  challenge.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth at 5.0% in 2010 was markedly lower than the very high \nrates of the previous few years when large investments rapidly expanded \nAzerbaijan\u2019s oil and gas resources. Growth in the oil economy (defined to \ninclude gas production) is estimated to have slowed to 1.8%. The non-oil \neconomy performed well, growing by 7.9%, as it recovered from the \nheadwinds of the global recession. With oil and gas production growth \nleveling off (oil production in 2010 was at 377.4 million barrels), the \noutlook is for moderate overall growth based largely on non-oil activity \n(Figure 3.2.1).\n\nRobust growth in the non-oil economy in 2010 was driven largely by \n\npublic investment, mainly in infrastructure projects that led to a 20.3% \nexpansion in construction activity (Figure 3.2.2). This was a marked \nrecovery from the 8.3% contraction in investment in 2009, when much \nlower oil prices and global crisis\u2013related uncertainty reined in public and \nprivate investment. Non-oil manufacturing is estimated to have grown \nby about 6.8%, after 2009\u2019s 12.6% contraction. Several public and private \nindustrial plants started operations and SOCAR, the state-owned oil \ncompany, expanded into non-oil manufacturing.\n\nServices growth was robust at 7.2%, driven by the strong expansion in \n\nthe non-oil economy as well as gains in gas transport services and new \ntechnologies in mobile communications and Internet access.\n\nAgriculture performed poorly, contracting by 2.2% in 2010 after 3.5% \ngrowth in 2009. This reflected a 33% drop in grain production that was \ncaused by flooding, a decline in the area cultivated, and falling yields. \nProduction of other agricultural products such as cotton and tobacco \npicked up.\n\nPublic investment, mainly in the non-oil sector, rose to 13% of GDP, \n\naccounting for nearly three-quarters of overall domestic investment. \nAlthough private investment fell slightly as a share of total investment, \nit was well above its low of 2008. Foreign direct investment in oil has \nbeen declining since 2006 with the completion of large investment \n\nThis chapter was written by Nail Valiyev of the Azerbaijan Resident Mission, ADB, Baku.\n\n3.2.1  Oil and non-oil GDP growth\n\nTotal\n\nOil\n\nNon-oil\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n12\n11\nForecast\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan. http://www.azstat.org\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.2.2  Non-oil GDP growth, by production\n\nAgriculture\nServices\n\nConstruction \nManufacturing\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan. http://www.azstat.org\nClick here for figure data\n\n09\n\n10\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n%\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n\f94    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nprojects as well as SOCAR\u2019s self-financing of new projects. Inflows into \nmanufacturing, transport, and communications went up.\n\nInflation crept up steadily during the year, to 5.7% in December 2010 \n\nyear on year from 1.5% in December 2009 (Figure 3.2.3). The upturn \nwas largely driven by rising prices of basic food items, including wheat, \nreflecting both higher import prices and the poor grain harvest. Nonfood \nprices increased moderately over the year. Demand factors, such as a pay \nhike for public servants and a robust expansion in credit to the private \nsector, appear to have put some additional pressure on these supply-side \nfactors.\n\nThe State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), set up to save a part of the \n\nnation\u2019s hydrocarbon earnings, is channeling some of its revenue to the \nbudget for financing public investment projects. Despite large transfers \nof\tthis\tnature\tin\t2010,\tSOFAZ\tassets\tsurged\tby\t52.8%\tto\t$22.8\tbillion\tat\t\nyear-end, buoyed by higher oil prices.\n\nBudget expenditure rose by 11.3% in 2010, though as a share of GDP \nit moderated by about 1 percentage point to 28.3% (Figure 3.2.4). Besides \nthe salary hike, 2010 saw markedly higher social and defense outlays; \npublic investment came in at 13% of GDP. Tax collection increased by only \n4.4% in 2010, as customs revenue contracted because of lower imports of \nmachinery and equipment. Total budget revenue declined by 2 percentage \npoints to 27.4% of GDP. The large gap between budget expenditure and \nrevenue was again bridged by substantial SOFAZ transfers, keeping the \noverall budget deficit small (0.9% of GDP).\n\nWithout the SOFAZ transfers the deficit would have been 15.1% \nof GDP, and these transfers have been rising in absolute terms and \nrelative to GDP in recent years. They now make up over one-half of the \ngovernment resources that finance budget expenditure. To arrest this \ntrend, the government would need to increase revenue from taxes and \nother charges, though a substantial move would stymie policies that seek \nstrong expansion in non-oil economic activity.\n\nThe Central Bank of Azerbaijan adopted an expansionary monetary \n\npolicy in 2009, aiming to counter the impact of the downdraft on \ngrowth from lower oil prices and an uncertain economic outlook. It \nset the refinancing rate at 2.0% and the reserve requirement at 0.5%. \nIt raised the refinancing rate to 3.0% in November 2010 and to 5% in \nMarch 2011, responding to the strengthening in the non-oil economy and \ninflation pressures. It continues, however, to provide long-term loans and \nadditional special financing support to private companies and banks at its \ndiscretion.\n\nEvidence of recovery is seen in a 9.7% rise in credit to the private \nsector and a 24% expansion in the broad money supply (Figure 3.2.5), \nwhich in part reflected a rebound in net foreign assets as the overall \nbalance returned to a large surplus. A sign of financial deepening and \ngreater confidence in the banking system was that the ratio of broad \nmoney to GDP rose from 23.8% in 2009 to 25.3% in 2010.\n\nIn overseeing the commercial banks, the central bank is implementing \n\nBasel standards to improve banking regulation and stability, as well as \nto strengthen public trust in the banking system. Banks have therefore \nboosted their capital position.

Non-oil exports saw a small gain despite agriculture\u2019s \ncontraction. Imports witnessed virtually no upturn despite the revival in \nnon-oil growth.\n\nSimilarly, net services and income payments were little changed from \na year earlier while workers\u2019 remittances, a marginal item in the balance \nof payments but an important source of support for rural households, \ntumbled.

Growth in oil revenue will allow a continued rise in social \nexpenditure and investment in infrastructure that should spur private \nactivity and improve the investment climate.\n\nThe hydrocarbon economy is expected to grow steadily at about \n3%\u20134% in the forecast period as oil and gas development sets the stage for \nfaster expansion in later years. Robust growth of the non-oil economy is \nexpected to stay driven by public sector investment.

Growth of 8% is foreseen in the non-oil sector in 2011 and \n2012. Overall GDP growth is projected at 5.8% in both years.\n\nThe central bank will aim to meet the credit demands of the non-oil \neconomy while keeping consumer price inflation in check, though price \nrises will probably be driven mainly by external factors. The exchange \nrate may come under some upward pressure because of larger surpluses \nin the balance of payments, but the bank will resist a marked appreciation \nas it would retard non-oil export development. Inflation is seen reaching \n7.5% in 2011 as global price pressures increase, gliding down to 7.0% in \n2012 as they moderate.\n\nHigher oil export revenue will outweigh the import growth arising \nfrom strengthening investment and the rising income\u2013related consumer \nspending. The current account surplus is expected to be 27.8% of GDP in \n2011 and 25.0% in 2012, as import demand rises in response to growth of \nincomes and appreciation of the manat, and as growth in oil revenue slows.\n\n\f96    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nDevelopment challenges\nDeveloping the non-oil sector and diversifying the economy is the \ngovernment\u2019s longer-term priority. Agriculture, manufacturing, \ntelecommunications, and tourism all have potential for growth. \nAgriculture is particularly crucial, as 40% of the population still lives \nin rural areas. Although government programs have attempted to \nsupport the sector, the rural population depends largely on remittances. \nFurther steps include rehabilitating and maintaining irrigation and other \ninfrastructure, improving land-management practices, enhancing inputs \nas well as credit and agricultural services, and boosting incentives for \nprivate participation.\n\nImproved physical infrastructure, particularly roads, railways, and \nenergy, is also essential for the non-oil sector. Additionally, medium- and \nlong-term private sector growth will depend on a stable macroeconomic \nenvironment and a better legal and regulatory framework, among other \nmeasures. Azerbaijan is now ranked 54 out of 183 in the World Bank\u2019s \nDoing Business 2011 report, ahead of most countries in the region. This \nranking reflects progress over the past year in providing access to credit \nand simplifying tax payment procedures.\n\nThe report shows that trade facilitation, too, requires work, as \n\nAzerbaijan is one of the 10 hardest countries from which to trade across \nborders. If it is to become a successful exporter, it needs to reduce both \nformal and informal barriers to trade. In addition, the procedures and \npermits required for certain sectors or operations need to be streamlined, \nwhile governance and transparency should be improved to ensure that the \nlarge public investment program provides its maximum potential benefit.\n\n3.2.2  Global rankings on the ease of \ntrading across borders, 2011\n\nNiger\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nBurundi\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nTajikistan\n\nIraq\n\nCongo, Republic of\n\nKazakhstan\n\nCentral African Republic\n\nAfghanistan\n\n174\n\n175\n\n176\n\n177\n\n178\n\n179\n\n180\n\n181\n\n182\n\n183\n\nNote: Out of 183 countries worldwide.\nSource: World Bank. Doing Business 2011. \n\n\fGeorgia\n\nOn  the  back  of  stronger  trade  demand  and  remittances,  as  well  as  a  fiscal  stimulus,  the  economy \nbounced  back  to  solid  growth  in  2010,  though  inflation  also  accelerated,  largely  on  global  price \npressures.  The  outlook  is  for  measured  growth  with  increased  reliance  on  the  private  sector  (including \nremittances  from  abroad)  and  for  continued  inflation  pressures.  Major  risks  relate  to  a  weak  recovery \nin  foreign  investment  and  other  capital  flows. \n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy recovered from the sharp contraction in the second half \nof 2008 and in 2009 to grow at 6.4% in 2010 (Figure 3.3.1). The broad-\nbased recovery was underpinned by a marked pickup in export demand \nand robust remittances, strong government investment, and a rebound \nin credit to the private sector. A striking revival in gross fixed capital \nformation of 22.5%, after a 32.8% drop in 2009, was the main impetus.\nOn the production side, industry and services grew steadily at \nabout the same pace. Industry advanced by 9.7%, led by high growth \nin manufacturing due to the rebound in export demand and to \nstrengthening consumer demand. Services picked up by 7.1% on account \nof high growth in trade, transport, and tourism as Georgia\u2019s west coast \ntourist venues bounced back to a highly successful season. By contrast, \nagriculture contracted marginally. Once a strong exporter, it has become \na low-profit sector as it cannot compete with grain and livestock imports.\nHeadline inflation accelerated from around mid-2010 to 13.7% by \nFebruary 2011 (Figure 3.3.2). The uptick was largely attributable to food \nitems (with a weight of 40.5% in the index), which rose by 28.4% owing \nto mounting global food prices. Price increases in other sectors were \nmoderate, pointing to limited pressures from the demand side.\n\nIn light of the renewed inflation pressures and economic recovery, the \nNational Bank of Georgia switched to monetary tightening in the second \nhalf of 2010, raising the policy rate in steps to 8% by February 2011. It also \ndoubled the reserve requirements to 10% on lari-denominated deposits in \nApril 2010 and on deposits in other currencies to 15% in February 2011.\nDespite these policies, credit to the economy grew by 20.4% in 2010 \n\nowing to rising business and bank confidence.

The upward revision in the policy rate \nhas narrowed its gap with deposit rates, making it less attractive to use \nthe refinancing facility. Increases in reserve requirements have reduced \nexcess bank reserves, as apparently reflected in slowing loan volumes in \nearly 2011, to a level that will make monetary control more effective. \n\nThe main prudential ratio in the financial system is well above the \nminimum requirement: the average risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio \nwas 17.4% at end-2010. Moreover, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total \nloans declined to 11.6% at year-end and banks made an aggregate profit \n(after 2009\u2019s loss).\n\nRecovery in economic activity along with improved tax \n\nadministration brought about a revival in tax receipts and general \ngovernment income (excluding grants). Total revenue increased by 11.4% \nyear on year. On the expenditure side, the government raised social \nspending and salaries, adjusting largely by containing other current \nexpenditure items such as spending on goods and services for public \nadministration. Capital spending and net lending rose somewhat more \nthan planned in the original program. Still, the deficit narrowed to 6.5% \nof GDP in 2010 from 9.2% a year earlier (Figure 3.3.5). \n\nForeign financing was much higher than a year earlier and provided \nmore than 80% of the deficit financing, although Treasury bills remained \nimportant.\n\nExternal public and publicly guaranteed debt increased from 31.4% of \n\nGDP in 2009 to 37.4% in 2010. The debt repayment burden will become \nvery heavy in 2013, when a large Eurobond issue matures and significant \nrepayment obligations to the International Monetary Fund fall due. Rapid \nfiscal consolidation is essential in preparing to make these payments.\nA recovery in global demand and higher prices of ferroalloys and \nnonferrous metals\u2014the country\u2019s leading export commodities\u2014helped to \nboost exports by 23.5%; imports grew by 15.8%. The trade deficit widened \nto\t$2.6\tbillion,\tthough\tthis\twas\tlargely\toffset\tby\tstronger\tnet\tremittances\t\nand services exports. \n\nThe current account deficit amounted to an estimated 11.4% of GDP \n\nin 2010, up from 11.2% in 2009 (Figure 3.3.6). Inflows of foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI), however, were disappointing. They had been expected \nto\tcome\tback\tas\tthe\tmain\tsource\tof\tgrowth,\tbut\tmissed\tthe\t$600\tmillion\t\ntarget.\n\nThe lari depreciated against the US dollar by about 5% in 2010. \n\nWeaker inflows in the first half of the year and banks\u2019 buildup of foreign \nexchange balances led to a larger depreciation in this period, but the \ncurrency subsequently strengthened (Figure 3.3.7) on improved earnings \nand capital inflows.

Hence more modest growth of 5.5% is projected. With \ngreater reliance on the private sector as a driver, growth is forecast to be \nsustained at 5.0% in 2012.\n\nEven though the growth of broad money is seen slowing to 20%\u201325% \nin 2011, the central bank\u2019s monetary program calls for a 15%\u201320% increase \nin credit to the private sector, which it perceives as appropriate for the \ngrowth target. The central bank is committed to a flexible exchange rate \nregime, and is moving to adopt inflation targeting.\n\nInflation is expected to be high in 2011 at 9.5% given the ongoing surge \nin global food and oil prices. It should edge down in 2012 on the view that \nfood price rises will be largely over and that oil and other import prices \nincrease only moderately. \n\nA new tax code that was passed in September 2010 (effective 1 January \n\n2011) should boost government revenue. Its impact, along with the \ngovernment\u2019s continued commitment to containing current spending, is \nseen narrowing the fiscal deficit to 4.0% of GDP in 2011 and to 3.4% in \n2012. Special measures to protect low-income families from high inflation, \nsuch as electricity vouchers introduced in February 2011 and food \nvouchers the following month, will require cuts in budgeted expenditure \nto maintain the 2011 deficit target. Fiscal adjustment, unlike in 2010, will \ninvolve holding back capital spending.\n\nThe current account deficit is expected to widen slightly to 12.6% of \nGDP in 2011 as rising food and oil prices add to the import bill. A steady \nstream of remittances and services surpluses as well as growing export \nrevenue from a sustained global recovery will help to rein in the deficit. \nIt is projected to narrow to 11.4% of GDP in 2012, largely reflecting a \nfurther narrowing of the trade gap. External financing requirements of \nthe current account deficit will increasingly rely on private inflows, such \nas FDI, as official development assistance slows.\n\nExternal risks associated with this outlook include a setback in the \n\nglobal recovery, higher than expected global commodity prices, and \nweaker FDI inflows. On the domestic front, the most significant risk is \nslow fiscal consolidation.\n\n3.3.6  Current account components\n\nCurrent account\n\n% of GDP\n8\n\nExports\nImports\nNet services\nNet income\nNet transfers\n\n$ billion\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n-12\n\nNominal\n\nGEL/$\n\n2.0\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. http://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 17 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.3.7  Exchange rates\n\nReal effective\n\nDec 1995 = 100\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. http://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 17 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n-16\n\n-24\n\n135\n\n125\n\n115\n\n105\n\n95\n\nDevelopment challenges\nA key challenge is to make growth sustainable over the medium term. \nThe country therefore needs to diversify its production structure and \nexports from traditional products.

The  outlook  is  for  steady  moderate  growth  and  a  comfortable  current \naccount  surplus.  Nevertheless,  limited  credit  availability  from  restructured  but  still  weak  banks  and \nrising  inflation  are  headwinds.  To  diversify  the  economy  and  raise  productivity,  the  government  is \nimplementing  an  industrial-innovation  program.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe recovery that started in the last quarter of 2009 continued into \n2010, giving full-year growth of 7.0% (Figure 3.4.1). Improved global \neconomic conditions, a revival in external demand for oil and minerals, \nand mounting oil prices all played a role, as did anticrisis measures put \nin place in 2009. Bank restructuring was also a positive factor, though \nprivate credit to the economy stayed weak.\n\nThis solid growth performance was driven by 9.6% growth of industry. \n\nManufacturing expanded by 18.4% and mining by 5.3%. Construction, \nwhich slowed sharply during 2007\u20132009, gained some momentum and \ngrew at 1.0% in 2010. Agriculture contracted by 11.7% in 2010 as a result of \ndamage that severe summer droughts caused to about 10% of arable land. \nWith overall economic activity picking up, services expanded by 6.0%.\nOn the demand side, after a stagnant 2009 and with the recovery \nbeginning to take hold, private consumption and gross fixed investment \ngrew by 7.5% and 7.0%, respectively, in 2010 (Figure 3.4.2). Credit \nconditions stayed tight, which may have held back further increases in \nprivate consumption and investment. After the slump of 2009, export \nvolume grew by 9.5% in 2010, as demand for oil and other key exports \npicked up. With rising consumption and investment, imports grew by \n6.5% in 2010.\n\nOverall average annual inflation reached 7.1% in 2010, remaining \nwithin the target band of 6%\u20138% of the National Bank of Kazakhstan \n(NBK). In January 2011, year-on-year headline inflation was, however, at \n8.1%, 0.8 percentage points higher than a year earlier. This rise was largely \ndue to the continued increase in prices of food items (Figure 3.4.3). The \nsharp drop in agricultural output as a result of the severe droughts that \nafflicted Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation in 2010 contributed to \nthe food price surge. Inflation for nonfood items and services continued \nto moderate, indicating some slack in the economy.\n\nWith the economy beginning to gain traction but also showing signs \nof weak private sector activity, the NBK kept the refinancing rate at 7.0% \nduring 2010, unchanged since September 2009.

Broad money supply increased by 14.1% in 2010, \nlargely on account of higher net foreign assets (Figure 3.4.4). Credit to \nthe economy grew by 6%, though that to the private sector rose by only \n0.8% in 2010, reflecting both weak private sector activity and risk aversion \namong banks.\n\nAfter the onset of the financial crisis and with falling oil prices, \n\nforeign exchange reserves came under stress.

As a result, current revenue climbed by 28%. \nTotal expenditure increased by 21%: 19% on current items, due \nto higher social spending and wages; 55% on capital items, due to \ninvestments in priority projects. The fiscal deficit narrowed to 2.5% of \nGDP in 2010 from 2.9% a year earlier. Most of the deficit was financed \nthrough domestic sources, although foreign financing increased.\n\nAfter a contraction in 2009, exports jumped by 38.5% in 2010 due \nto the improved global economic environment and higher oil prices. \nImports recovered to grow by 10.3% in 2010.

It \nremoves duties on goods originating in member states \nand enforces a common external tariff for trade with third \ncountries. It also establishes a common customs territory \nin which terminology, a customs code, and customs duties \nwill be unified. \n\nThe union took effect on 1 January 2010 with a unified \n\ncustoms rate. At this first stage, the three countries \nremoved most duties on trade among themselves. \n\nOn 1 July 2010, a customs code was launched between \nKazakhstan and the Russian Federation, coming into force \na few days later in Belarus. This second stage led to the \nadoption of common external tariffs. \n\nIn the third stage, customs clearance and control \nprocedures at the Kazakh\u2013Russian Federation border are \n\nscheduled to be abolished by 1 July 2011. (Such measures \nwere implemented at the Belarus\u2013Russian Federation \nborder in July 2010.) By January 2012, a single economic \nspace will be achieved among the three countries.\n\nThe tariff regime is based heavily on that in the Russian \nFederation, and Kazakhstan had to raise tariffs on around \n45% of all imported items. The average common customs \ntariff rate is 10.6%, whereas previously Kazakhstan\u2019s simple \nmost-favored-nation applied tariff was only 6.16%.\n\nThe value-added tax rate applied to third countries \nis 17%. Import customs duties from goods originating \noutside the union will be distributed among the three \ncountries according to an agreed formula of 87.97% for \nthe Russian Federation, 7.33% for Kazakhstan, and 4.70% \nfor Belarus.\n\ntwo banks and of two other smaller banks had to be restructured, \nresulting\tin\tdebt\trelief\tof\t$11\tbillion.\tOverall,\tthe\tshare\tof\tnonperforming\t\nloans in the total loan portfolio is about 30%, and is a key factor \nhampering lending activity.\n\nIn addition, the restructuring of external debt has affected the \nprivate sector\u2019s access to international markets. The country\u2019s leading \nprivate bank, Kazkommertsbank, postponed its issuance of international \nbonds, citing unfavorable market conditions (although state-owned \nKazMunayGas and Kazakhstan Temir Zholy were readily able to raise \nmoney in international markets in 2010). Continued risk aversion has \naffected credit availability, in turn holding back private consumption and \ninvestment.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe recovery of agriculture after the sharp contraction of 2010, capital \nexpenditure by the government on priority projects in its program for \n2010\u20132014, a sustained global recovery, and an increase in oil demand and \nprices will help run the growth momentum in 2011 and 2012. At the same \ntime, banks\u2019 continued fragility and steep oil and food price rises may \nundermine the global economy and work against Kazakhstan\u2019s growth. \nThe forecast is for GDP to grow by 6.5% in 2011 and 6.8% in 2012.\n\nConstruction will continue to face weaknesses as a result of lack of \ncredit and the inability of the private sector to raise funds in international \nmarkets on attractive terms. Private consumption and total investment \nare expected to see continued growth in 2011 and 2012. Credit availability \nwill be an important factor if higher growth rates are to be achieved. \nHowever, higher oil prices and external demand will help to boost \nconsumption as well as investment in the oil sector.\n\nThe government is considering several programs that will help to \nsupport private consumption and investment over the projection horizon \nand beyond. One of them, Employment 2020, targets the self-employed, \nespecially those in rural areas.

Both social and capital expenditure on priority projects \nwill climb. Overall, the government is likely to achieve its target of \nnarrowing the fiscal deficit to 2.2% in 2011 and 1.7% in 2012.\n\nWith the surge in global food prices and the region still reeling from \nthe effects of the severe droughts, the prices of many food items are likely \nto rise further. In February 2011, the government introduced price ceilings \nfor essential food items. A utility fee increase in January 2011 and a boost \nto consumption from wage increases in the second half of 2011 will add to \ninflation pressures. \n\nSome slack still appears to be in the economy, however\u2014as observed \nfrom moderate prices of nonfood items and services\u2014and this will help \nto contain inflation this year, to 8.5%, as inflation pressures subside later \nin the year. Inflation in 2012 is expected to be 6.0%.\n\nThough the trading band for the exchange rate was widened in \nFebruary 2010, the NBK has intervened to prevent the tenge from \nappreciating sharply. On 28 February 2011, it abolished the corridor for \nthe\ttenge/$\texchange\trate\tand\tintroduced\ta\tmanaged\tfloat\tregime.\tIt\t\nis\tunlikely\tthat\tthe\ttenge\twill\tbe\tallowed\tto\tbreach\tT141/$,\tas\tfurther\t\nappreciation, combined with the inflation differential with the advanced \ncountries, could result in a loss of competitiveness.\n\nThe current account balance is projected to remain positive in 2011 \n\nand 2012, at 3.5% of GDP. Imports will increase on the back of higher \nprivate consumption and investment as banks become more willing to \nlend, and of government investment in a variety of priority projects. \nExports will markedly increase further due to higher oil prices and \nstronger demand for oil. The trade surplus will be offset by the deficit on \nother components of the current account.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nDiversifying the economy\u2019s industrial base, lowering reliance on natural \nresources, and generating more balanced and equitable development \nconstitute the premier development challenges. Another is to increase \ncompetitiveness (Box 3.4.2).\n\n3.4.2 Accelerated Industrial and \nInnovative Development Program\n\nThe primary thrust of the government\u2019s \nindustrialization program (released \nin March 2010) is diversifying the \neconomy and reducing reliance on \noil. The second is increasing national \ncompetitiveness. \n\nThe program lists the following \n(among others) as critical to success: \ndeveloping the priority sectors of \nthe economy (heavy machinery, \ninformation and communications, \neducation, and health care); \nstrengthening the \u201csocial effectiveness\u201d \nof the priority sectors and investment \nprojects; and creating a favorable \nindustrialization environment. \n\nThe strategy identifies four sectors \n\nwhere the efforts of the state will be \nconcentrated:\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nTraditional industries: natural gas \nsector, mining and metallurgy, \natomic energy, and chemical \nindustry.\nHigh domestic demand: machine \nbuilding, pharmaceuticals, \nconstruction, and building \nmaterials.\nPredominantly export oriented: \nagribusiness, light industry, and \ntourism.\nSectors of the future: information \nand communications technology, \nbiotechnology, alternative power \nengineering, nuclear energy, and \nspace.\nState support to the priority \n\nsectors includes provision of physical \ninfrastructure (such as information \nand communications, energy, and \ntransport) and social infrastructure \n(such as skilled human resources).\nSuch support also includes \nmeasures to reduce administrative \nbarriers, guidelines on technical \nregulations, and providing a conducive \nenvironment for foreign direct \ninvestment.\n\n\fKyrgyz Republic\n\nSociopolitical  protests  in  Bishkek  in  April  2010  that  ousted  the  former  president,  followed  by  ethnic \nviolence in the south in June, battered the economy. Disruption was then exacerbated by border closures \nwith Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the main transport conduits for trade. The crisis has put public finances \nunder severe stress, alleviated by a July 2010 $1.1 billion pledge of assistance from donors. The time taken \nto  return  to  normality  will  depend  heavily  on  the  new  government\u2019s  ability  to  bring  about  and  maintain \npolitical  and  social  stability. \n\nEconomic performance\nAfter modest growth of 2.9% in 2009, the country was recovering well \nfrom the global economic crisis as GDP growth bounded to 16.4% \nin the first quarter of 2010. But the closures of international borders \nfollowing the April and June events stopped imports and exports at times, \nintensifying the impact of the internal disruptions on the economy. For \nall 2010, GDP dropped by 1.4% (Figure 3.5.1). \n\nAll sectors contracted in 2010, except for gold and other industrial \n\nproduction, which grew by 8% and 11.3%, respectively. Gold output \nclimbed mainly because of a higher ore yield. Expansion in industrial \nproduction was largely attributable to a low 2009 base, reflecting the \nimpact of global and regional recession. Some subsectors, however, \nshowed strong outturns: garments were up by an estimated 50% and \nelectricity, gas, and water services were together 11% higher. \n\nAgricultural output fell by 2.8% largely due to delays in sowing crops \n\n(a knock-on effect of the disturbances) and an ensuing lower harvest in \npart caused by shortages of imported fuel. Construction output fell by \n22.8%, as unrest and supply disruptions curtailed work, including that on \nlarge investment projects in the hydropower and mining subsectors.\nThe contraction in GDP would have been more severe without \n\nexpanded gold production. Also of help was an estimated 25% increase in \nworkers\u2019 remittances (from the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, the \ncountry\u2019s main economic partners) that boosted a major source of income \nfor the population, helping to ease the downward pressure on aggregate \ndemand (Figure 3.5.2).\n\nThe imposition of duty by the Russian Federation on oil exports to \n\nthe Kyrgyz Republic raised domestic oil-product prices by about 35%. \nThis and increasing imported food prices, combined with lower domestic \nwheat production, have significantly added to inflation pressures. In the \nsecond half of 2010, inflation accelerated steadily and reached 19.2% at \nyear-end, with food prices up by 27% (Figure 3.5.3).

Low \ninflation early in the year kept annual average inflation to 8.0%. \n\nThe April and June 2010 events have significantly increased budgetary \n\nexpenditure on compensation to the families of victims; unplanned \nspending for the constitutional referendum and elections; outlays \nassociated with rehabilitating damaged infrastructure and buildings; \nsecurity expenditure; and subsidies for utility companies due to the tariff-\nhike reversal. On the revenue side, improved tax administration in the \nsecond half of the year helped to offset the negative impact of the crisis \nand border closure on value-added tax and customs collections. \n\nIn 2010, the budget deficit widened to an estimated 6.5% of GDP \n(Figure 3.5.4). Assistance from both bilateral and multilateral donors as \nwell\tas\tuse\tof\tthe\t$300\tmillion\tRussian\tloan\tproceeds\t(received\tin\t2009)\t\ncovered financing needed for the enlarged deficit. Since some of the \nrecent spending increases were one time (for rehabilitation and social \nprotection, resettlement, and reconstruction), they can be unwound as the \nsituation improves in 2011, though much rebuilding will still be needed in \n2012. Reconstruction, alongside the government\u2019s plans to greatly increase \nsalaries of teachers and other social sector workers from May 2011, will \nfurther widen the budget deficit. Government estimates of the budget \ndeficit for 2011 are around 9%. \n\nIn\tJuly\t2010,\tthe\tdonor\tcommunity\tpledged\t$1.1\tbillion\tassistance\tover\t\n\n30 months. External support will be critical in helping the authorities to \ndeal with the consequences of the crisis. External\u2014mainly concessional\u2014\nborrowing increased publicly guaranteed external debt from around 53% \nin 2009 of GDP to an estimated 62% in 2010. The external debt ratio is \nforecast to reach 67% by end-2011. Although the International Monetary \nFund rates the country\u2019s risk of debt distress as moderate, the government \nwill need to follow prudent policies to ensure external debt sustainability.\nIn response to the crisis, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic \n\n(NBKR, the central bank) eased its monetary stance by lowering the \nreserve requirement by 1.5 percentage points to 8.0% in May 2010, and \nadjusted the sale of its notes to changing monetary circumstances. \nNevertheless, credit to the economy increased by only 2.7% due to weak \ndemand and troubled banking conditions. The public\u2019s preference to \nincrease its cash holdings at the expense of deposits surged after the April \nevents, pressuring banking system liquidity and complicating the central \nbank\u2019s monetary operations. Despite the downturn in economic activity \nand banking sector problems, external finance of the fiscal expansion \nincreased monetary aggregates. In 2010, money supply rose by 18.6%, \nprimarily due to increased foreign assets (Figure 3.5.5). \n\nThe crisis shook financial stability. Loan quality has worsened \ndramatically\u2014the ratio of nonperforming loans rose from 7.9% before \nApril to an estimated 16% at year-end. The deterioration in quality has \nbeen mainly concentrated in loans for trade and commerce. The NBKR \nintroduced temporary administration at seven banks (later reduced to \nfour), including Asia Universal Bank\u2014the largest bank with over 20% of \nbank deposits\u2014after it experienced a large nonresident deposit outflow, \nallegedly linked to the previous regime.

Despite difficulties, the banking system remains adequately \nliquid and capitalized.\n\nIn April and May, the NBKR undertook large US dollar sales in \nthe foreign exchange market to meet public demand and prevent an \nexcessive depreciation of the local currency. For much of the rest of \nthe year, it intervened to offset pressures for appreciation stemming \nfrom large donor-funded external budgetary support. Over the year, \nthe som depreciated by around 7% against the dollar (Figure 3.5.6). In \nview of continued large expected inflows of external assistance in 2011, \nthe NBKR plans to intervene to forestall an unwarranted appreciation \nof the exchange rate and reduce excess bank liquidity created by these \noperations. \n\nExporters did not fully benefit from the economic recovery in the \nRussian Federation and Kazakhstan in the wake of internal unrest and \nperiods of closed borders. Further, the introduction of a customs union \namong the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and Belarus in July 2010 \ndecreased the volume of Chinese goods that are reexported, as they now \nface higher duties into the union. Still, increased production of gold, the \ncountry\u2019s main export commodity, and rising gold prices helped to bolster \nexport revenue that is estimated to have increased by 7.0% for the year. \nDespite the border disruptions, imports are estimated to have \n\nincreased by 15.0%. This expansion reflected higher import prices of food \nand fuel, though imports financed by donors and workers\u2019 remittances \nwere also factors. The current account deficit is estimated at 5.0% of GDP \nin 2010, up from 2.4% a year earlier (Figure 3.5.7).\n\nOn the political scene, following the resignation of the former \npresident in April, an interim government assumed power. It drafted a \nnew constitution, which was adopted in a nationwide referendum in June, \nchanging the country\u2019s political system into a parliamentary republic. \n(The country also elected an interim president, whose tenure will last until \n31 December 2011. A presidential election under the new constitutional \narrangement is scheduled for October 2011.) Parliamentary elections were \nheld on 10 October 2010, with five parties winning seats. Following the \ncreation of a majority coalition consisting of three parties in December \n2010, Parliament elected a speaker and formed a government. \n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is expected to pick up with GDP growing at around 5% in \n2011 and 2012. The forecasts rest on expectations of a normal security \nenvironment, continued reconstruction works, full resumption of trade \nand services flows, and improved investor confidence. They also rely \nheavily on construction growing by about 40%, mainly due to large-\nscale reconstruction works in the south. Services and industry are seen \ngrowing by 6% and 4%, respectively. \n\nEconomic expansion of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan will \n\nalso contribute to growth through increased demand for the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s exports and higher remittances from workers in those two \ncountries. \n\nConsiderable fiscal challenges loom over the next 2 years.

It therefore plans to improve \ntax and customs administration and cut nonpriority spending. Around \n73% of the budget deficit will be financed by donors.\n\nThe pickup in economic activity with higher import prices for \nfood and higher remittance spending will exert an upward pressure on \nconsumer prices. The NBKR\u2019s monetary and exchange rate policies will \naim to keep inflation in check by neutralizing the effects of large fiscal \nexpansion yet support the postcrisis recovery. Cancellation of export \nduties on petroleum products by the Russian Federation from 1 January \n2011 will help to mitigate upward pressures on prices. For 2011, average \ninflation is expected to move higher to 13.0% and then moderate to 8.0% \nin 2012 as global price pressures subside. \n\nExtensive reconstruction works and a recovery in domestic demand \nwill raise the import bill in the forecast period. Increases in global food \nand oil prices will also push imports higher. Gold prices are expected to \nrise by 5%\u201310% in 2011 and remain at historically high levels. Remittances \nare forecast to increase moderately, after their strong growth in 2010.\n\nThe current account deficit is projected at 9.0% of GDP in 2011 and \n2012. Foreign direct investment is likely to remain low in the next 2 years \ndue to the uncertain political and security situation, though large inflows \nof official external assistance are expected to finance the large current \naccount deficit.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nThe country faces huge challenges in economic recovery, reconstruction, \nand social reconciliation. Success will not be easy given the considerable \npressure on public financial resources in a weakened economy. Achieving \nsustainable robust economic growth remains the major challenge facing \nthe country. \n\n\fTajikistan\n\nRising remittance inflows and strong industry  and  construction  outturns  revived  growth in 2010, aided \nby  a  favorable  climate  that  supported  year-round  hydropower  output.  The  economy  is  projected  to \nsustain  growth  in  2011\u20132012  despite  risks  from  rising  food  and  fuel  prices,  transport  bottlenecks,  and \na  poor  investment  climate.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP climbed to 6.5% in 2010 from 3.4% in 2009 (Figure 3.6.1). Industry \ngrew by about 10%, as favorable weather allowed higher hydropower \nproduction (which accounts for most of the electricity generated), in turn \nallowing small and medium-sized enterprises to maintain continuous \noperations in winter. Thus industrial growth mainly came from these \nenterprises, particularly in light manufacturing and food processing, \nunlike previous years. \n\nAluminum production suffered due to limited imports of alumina, \ncaused by intermittent disruptions to rail transit through Uzbekistan. \nThese were largely resolved in the second half of the year. Indeed, the two \ncountries have faced several bilateral issues over the years. At present, the \nmain one relates to differences over managing riparian resources.\n\nPublic spending on key infrastructure projects, such as roads, tunnels, \n\nand transmission lines, grew, underpinning growth in construction.\n\nGrowth in agriculture slowed to a still strong 6.8% after an unusually \n\nhigh 10.5% gain in 2009 (due to a reallocation of land to noncotton \nagriculture). Slowing activity in retail trade, as disruption in rail transit \nrestricted imports, held services growth to about 5%.\n\nEconomic recovery in the Russian Federation lifted remittances by \n29%\tto\t$2.4\tbillion\tin\t2010\t(Figure\t3.6.2),\tthe\tequivalent\tof\t40%\tof\tGDP.\t\nThey remained a key factor in economic and social stability in Tajikistan, \nsupporting domestic demand and private consumption.\n\nThe government launched a massive public campaign to collect funds \n\nfor building the Roghun hydropower plant in January 2010. It believes \nthat, if carried out, this project could end perennial winter power deficits \nand allow Tajikistan to become a substantial regional electricity exporter. \nThe\tcampaign\ttargeted\traising\t$1.4\tbillion\tto\tconstruct\tthe\tinitial\tphase\tof\t\nRoghun by selling shares to the public.

Higher global fuel prices and the imposition by that \ncountry (the main supplier of petroleum) of export duty on hydrocarbons \nadded a further supply-side push. Demand-side pressures from increased \nremittance spending also stoked inflation, which averaged 6.4% in 2010.\n\nBanks continued to face tight liquidity conditions and high rates of \n\nnonperforming loans. They are constrained by a low deposit base and \na limited ability to attract capital inflows, while they have significant \nexposure to risky credits in agriculture and a shortage of sound \ninvestment opportunities.\n\nThe\tgovernment\twrote\toff\tabout\t$500\tmillion\tof\tdoubtful\tcotton\t\nsector loans. This move cut banks\u2019 ratio of nonperforming loans from \n28% at end-2009 to about 18% a year later, but as their compensation \nwas in the form of very low yielding T-bills it contributed little to their \nliquidity, income, and ability to take up new lending opportunities. Trade \ndisruption and delayed cargo deliveries hit trade finance, a sizable part of \nbanks\u2019 normal business given that imports are over one-half of GDP.\nAll these factors restrained credit expansion to the private sector. \nTo\tmitigate\tbanks\u2019\tdifficulties,\tthe\tgovernment\tdeposited\t$50\tmillion\t\ncollected during the Roghun campaign at commercial banks to \nstrengthen their reserves and add to lending capacity. \n\nIn response to rising inflation, the central bank lifted its refinancing \n\nrate from 8.0% to 8.25% in November 2010 and to 9.0% in March 2011. \nIn 2010, bank lending rates varied around 25% while deposit rates varied \naround 6.5%, the large spread reflecting both high doubtful loans and \nstructural difficulties.\n\nTajikistan continued to pursue fiscal policy aimed at macroeconomic \n\nstabilization while sustaining pro-poor programs. The government\u2019s \npostcrisis plan, adopted in early 2010, aimed to lift social expenditure \nto 11.5% of GDP in 2010, but could not meet the target. This was mainly \nbecause revenue collection was under stress in the first half of last year \nowing to reduced collection of value-added tax on imports and of customs \nduties, but revenue picked up after the easing of the transit bottleneck. \n\nAlthough government revenue and expenditure did not fully reach \n\nbudgeted levels, the overall deficit (excluding the public investment \nprogram and related grants) kept to the target of 1% of GDP in 2010 \n(Figure 3.6.4).\n\nRecent fiscal deficits have been financed by external support, but \nborrowing capacity is low. The government\u2019s emphasis on completing \ninfrastructure projects financed by external borrowing raised the debt-\nto-GDP ratio slightly to 34.4% of GDP in 2010 (Figure 3.6.5). The latest \ndebt sustainability analysis from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \ncarried out in July 2010, puts Tajikistan at high risk of debt distress. \nThe government is committed to controlling the debt level: its debt \nmanagement strategy limits the ratio to 40% of GDP.\n\nHigher global prices for aluminum and cotton underpinned a 40.9% \nsurge in exports in 2010, a marked turnaround from the prior-year\u2019s 10.7% \ncontraction. In volume terms, exports of aluminum rose moderately but \ncotton fell, as less land had been allocated to production. Imports grew by \nonly 8.2%, mainly because of the rail disruptions. \n\nThe increase in export earnings outpaced the unusually small rise in \nimports and kept the trade deficit largely unchanged from the previous \n\n3.6.3  Inflation\n\nFood\n\nOverall\n\n%\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFood\nOverall\n\nJan\n2006\n\nJan\n07\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: Tajikistan State Statistics Agency. http://www.stat.tj\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.6.4  Fiscal balance\nIncluding PIP\n\nExcluding PIP\n\n% of GDP\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nPIP = public investment program.\nSource: International Monetary Fund. 2010.

But the level of foreign reserves remained \nlow at year-end, equal to only 2.3 months of projected 2011 imports.\n\n% of GDP\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is projected to edge up to 6.8% in 2011 and 7.0% in 2012, fueled by \ncontinued remittance inflows and by increases in aluminum and cotton \nprices in 2011, both of which fall off but stay high in 2012. \n\nRemittances are forecast to grow by about 7% each year, reaching their \n\nprecrisis high in 2012. They will underpin rising private consumption \nexpenditure, boosting imports and so buoying budget revenue. \n\nProduction of aluminum and cotton is projected to rise moderately, \nresponding to higher global prices (as well as reallocation of land back to \ncotton), but limited aluminum production capacity and inefficient cotton \nfinancing will hold back a stronger response. Agricultural processing, light \nindustry, construction, and services will likely continue their strong growth.\n\nInflation in 2011 and 2012 is projected to increase to 10.5% and \n9.5%, reflecting rising global food and fuel prices. The authorities are \ncommitted to maintaining a cautious fiscal and monetary stance under \ntheir economic program with the IMF and have averred that they would \ntighten policies if nonfood price pressures emerge. The central bank has \nalready raised its refinancing rate.\n\nRising remittance-fueled consumption spending and expanding \npublic investment are projected to generate much stronger import growth \nin 2011 and 2012 of about 28% and 10%, assuming normal regional trade \nand cargo transit arrangements. Exports are set to rise, by around 25% \nand 1%, largely reflecting global price movements. The trade deficit will \ndeteriorate, and even with expected higher remittances the current \naccount balance will move to a deficit of 4.3% and 6.4% of GDP.\n\nThese projections are subject to several external and internal risks, \n\nincluding growth in the Russian Federation\u2019s economy; the level of \nprecipitation, essential for agriculture and water accumulation for \nelectricity generation; and political and social stability. \n\nDevelopment challenges\nTajikistan faces interrelated challenges that hinder reduction of \nwidespread poverty and a move to higher and more sustainable \ngrowth.

Doing Business 2011. \n\n\fTurkmenistan\n\nGrowth  recovered  to  near  double-digit  levels  in  2010  with  resumption  of  gas  exports  and  new  gas \npipelines,  alongside  large-scale  public  investments.  The  outlook  is  for  continued  strong  growth  and \nmoderate  inflation.  But  moving  the  economy  from  its  heavy  dependence  on  hydrocarbons  requires  a \ndiversified  base  of  industries  and  services,  as  well  as  a  dynamic  private  sector.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy rebounded in 2010 with government sources estimating \nGDP growth at over 9%, close to the levels seen prior to the global \nrecession (Figure 3.7.1). Much of the growth derived from the resumption \nof natural gas exports to the Russian Federation, which were suspended \nfor much of 2009, and the opening of new gas pipelines to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The strong growth \nalso came from large-scale public investments, a surge in foreign \ndirect investment, and rapid gains in construction, transport and \ncommunications, textiles, and agriculture.\n\nNatural gas remains the mainstay of the economy\u2014hydrocarbon \n\nexports accounted for over 90% of exports in 2010. Moreover, \nhydrocarbon production is the main source of government revenue. Gas \nexports reportedly grew by 34% in 2010 from the previous year.\n\nConsumer price inflation for the end of period was estimated to have \nrisen from 0.1% in 2009 to 4.6% in 2010, giving a 2010 average of 3.9%, a \nswitch from deflation of 2.7% in 2009 (Figure 3.7.2). The inflation partly \nreflects rising international food and grain prices, which went up by about \n12% in 2010. Government controls over certain prices, wages, and pensions \nand a stable exchange rate helped to keep consumer prices in check.\nThe government\u2019s expansionary fiscal policy reduced the budget \n\nsurplus from an estimated 7.8% of GDP in 2009 to 2.8% in 2010 \n(Figure 3.7.3). Much of the spending is guided by the National Program \nof Social and Economic Development, which was updated in mid-2010 to \ncover 2011\u20132030. The program entails large public investment in economic \nand social infrastructure.\n\nThe recovery in gas exports and increased earnings from higher \noil export prices helped to narrow the current account deficit from an \nestimated 16.1% of GDP in 2009 to 4.7% in 2010 (Figure 3.7.4).

The predicted growth \nrates will result from higher volumes of natural gas exports due to new \npipelines with the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Islamic Republic \nof Iran, and continued implementation of the government\u2019s development \npolicies. The global gas supply glut will likely peak in 2011 and gas prices \nwill remain low, but demand by Turkmenistan\u2019s established buyers should \nstay strong.\n\nGrowing gas exports are necessary to finance the government\u2019s \nheavy spending on infrastructure and the social sector. It is expected to \ncontinue its fiscal stimulus, in line with the recently updated National \nProgram. These measures, along with an expected rise in global food and \nother commodity prices, are likely to add to inflation in 2011, nudging it \nup to 5.0% in 2011 and 6.0% in 2012.\n\nTrade with neighbors should receive a boost in 2012 if the \n\nconstruction of the new North\u2013South railway linking Turkmenistan with \nKazakhstan and the Islamic Republic of Iran is completed on schedule. \nTotal exports are seen rising by nearly 24% in 2011, and imports by 4%. A \npotential\ttrade\tsurplus\tof\tover\t$2\tbillion\tin\t2011\tcould\tlead\tto\ta\tcurrent\t\naccount surplus of 3.4% of GDP.\n\nLong-term growth prospects are enhanced by the long-awaited \nagreement signed in December 2010 for the ambitious Turkmenistan\u2013\nAfghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India gas pipeline. While security challenges in two \nof the countries pose risks to construction and operation, the four countries \nhave targeted a gas delivery date by 2015. On completion, the pipeline will \ndeliver 33 billion cubic meters annually and increase Turkmenistan\u2019s total \ngas exports to Asia to over 90 billion cubic meters a year.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nHighly dependent on exports of energy, Turkmenistan faces several \nchallenges in diversifying the economy to high-value-added and \ntechnology-based goods and services. This requires numerous structural \nreforms\u2014administrative, financial, and institutional, for example.\nSuccessful diversification also requires efficient reallocation of \nresource revenue to productive sectors. The government will therefore \nhave to make a thorough cost-benefit analysis and prioritize value-added \ninvestments, and, going beyond gas-related industries, create processing \nand manufacturing industries capable of generating new sources of \nincome. Ongoing large government investment in mining, textiles, food \nprocessing, and tourism are a step in the right direction, but much more \ninvestment is required.\n\nTurkmenistan also needs to develop a dynamic private sector. An \nadequate legal and regulatory framework for private business must be in \nplace, along with an expanded banking sector that can provide financial \ncapital. Additionally, the country needs to develop entrepreneurship and \nexpertise in market principles in the public and private sectors.\n\n3.7.3  General government fiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n12\n\nGeneral government fiscal balance\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund. 2010.

The outlook is for sustained public sector\u2013oriented growth, and continued \nstrong  fiscal  and  external  positions.  The  authorities  need  to  keep  a  close  eye  on  inflation,  though  it  is \nexpected  to  remain  moderate.  Diversification  from  the  commodity  and  energy  sectors,  alongside  private \nsector  development,  would  help  to  generate  broad-based  and  sustained  growth.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy continued to perform well in 2010, supported by the effects \nof a fiscal stimulus, the government\u2019s medium-term investment program, \nand the global economic recovery. Growth was driven mainly by industry \n(including construction) and services (Figure 3.8.1), with estimated annual \ngrowth rates of 8.3% and 11.6%, respectively. \n\nIn industry, growth was led by the chemical, machinery, light, and \nfood industries, which together expanded by 12.0% and accounted for \nalmost half of total industrial output. These industries benefited from \nthe significant public investment and commercial bank lending provided \nunder the government\u2019s 2009\u20132010 anticrisis and industrial modernization \nprograms. The chemical and machinery industries are also attracting \ninvestment from Asia and the Middle East. Construction grew at 8.1%, \nlargely due to government support to rural infrastructure and housing \ndevelopment, as well as greater foreign investment in hydrocarbons. \n\nThe expansion in services mainly reflected increases in government \nsocial spending for health care, especially in rural areas. Favorable weather \nand higher vegetable crop cultivation led to agricultural growth of 6.8%. \nIn 2010, the government continued implementing infrastructure \nprograms aimed at developing rural areas and modernizing industry. \nThe Fund for Reconstruction and Development (FRD) and state-owned \nbanks allocated about $6.0 billion. Lending from commercial banks to the \neconomy increased by one-third in 2010. Gross fixed capital investment \nrose by 9.2%, to the equivalent of around 30% of GDP (Figure 3.8.2). \nAccording to the government, about $3.9 billion, or 25.1%, was foreign. \n\nThe majority of foreign investment goes into fuel, energy, \n\ntelecommunications, and automobile manufacturing. The government \nreported that it plans to attract up to $50 billion in foreign investment \nduring 2011\u20132015. Notable projects include a joint venture with Daimler \non bus assembly and expansion of production lines at GM Uzbekistan (a \njoint venture between General Motors and the state-owned Uzavtosanoat \ncompany). Under government initiatives to encourage use of natural gas \nin vehicles, a new joint venture between Uzbekistan and the Republic of \nKorea will construct gas compressor stations for cars.\n\nIn February and October 2010, the authorities raised utility prices \n\nThis chapter was written by Iskandar Gulamov of the Uzbekistan Resident Mission, \nADB, Tashkent.\n\n3.8.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nNet indirect taxes\n\nPercentage points\n12\n\n9.5\n\n9.0\n\n7.2\n\n8.1\n\n8.5\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSources: State Statistics Committee of Uzbekistan; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n10\n\n09\n\n3.8.2  Structure of GDP (expenditure)\n\nFinal consumption\nFixed capital investment\nNet exports\nOthers\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n07\n\n09\n\n10\n\n2006\n\n08\nNote: Others refer to statistical discrepancy and changes \nin stocks.\nSources: Center for Economic Research.

The increases, with \ndepreciation of the local currency and a 30% annual hike in public wages \nand pensions, put upward pressure on inflation. The central bank sought \nto mitigate this pressure by slowing broad money growth to 34.6% from \nits peak of 43.8% in 2009. The government reported year-end inflation \nof 7.3%. The latest estimate from the International Monetary Fund for \naverage inflation is 10.6% (Figure 3.8.3). \n\nThe local currency depreciated by 8.3% against the dollar in 2010. On \n1 January 2011, the central bank reduced its benchmark refinancing rate \nfrom 14% to 12% to reduce the rates of loans provided under its programs \nfor industrial modernization, rural housing construction, and small and \nmedium-sized enterprises.\n\nThe general government budget is estimated to be in balance in 2010. \n\nTaking into account the FRD, the consolidated budget is estimated to \nhave a surplus of 2.5% of GDP (Figure 3.8.4). The steep wage and pension \nhike, greater support for health care, as well as the rural development \nprogram have lifted budget spending to an estimated 34.6% of GDP. \nThe government also provided tax exemptions for enterprises operating \nunder investment and localization programs, but revenue gains from \ncommodity exports and the utility price adjustments were enough to \noffset the increased expenditure.\n\nIn line with the policy of reducing direct taxation to encourage \neconomic activity, in 2010 the government reduced the rates of both \ncorporate and personal income taxes by 1 percentage point to 9% and 11%, \nrespectively. The fiscal authorities also reduced the rate of the unified tax \npaid by micro and small firms from 8% to 7%. The share of direct taxes in \nGDP decreased from 7.1% in 2008 to an estimated 5.9% in 2010.\n\nReflecting the increased infrastructure development and subsequent \nrise in foreign financing, including government-guaranteed foreign debt, \ntotal external debt is estimated to have risen to 14.9% of GDP, slightly \nabove the 2009 figure of 14.6%.\n\nThe international prices of gas, cotton, and gold, Uzbekistan\u2019s main \nexport commodities, were historically high throughout 2010, leading to \ngoods and services export growth of 10.8%. That growth was also aided \nby recovery in the Russian Federation, with the share of machinery, \nincluding passenger vehicles, in total exports more than doubling in 2010. \nStronger growth in the Commonwealth of Independent States sharply \nboosted foodstuff exports.\n\nby 6.8% in 2010. Imports of machinery and equipment, 44% of the \ntotal, dropped by 27.3%. Official import restrictions reduced imports, \nespecially from countries in the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates. Reflecting a pickup in global food prices as well as stronger \nconsumption demand, the share of foodstuffs in imports climbed from \n10.3% in 2009 to 10.9% in 2010. \n\nRemittances sent to Uzbekistan from the Russian Federation rose by \nan\testimated\t22%\tin\t2010\tto\t$1.4\tbillion\t(to\taround\t3.7%\tof\tGDP),\tgiven\t\nthe economic pickup in that country.

Industry (particularly \nconstruction) and services are expected to be the major contributors. \nIndustrial output will be driven by domestic lending and foreign \ninvestment, while services will expand in line with higher domestic \ndemand. Increasing lending coupled with favorable international prices \nwill stimulate output of energy, machinery, and metals. Agriculture is \nexpected to be driven by higher vegetable and fruit output, while grain \nproduction will improve moderately. \n\nThe share of investment in GDP is expected to climb rapidly in the \n\nforecast period, partly because the government is seen pursuing the \ninfrastructure development programs faster.

It is also seen further reducing the tax burden and strengthening \nrevenue collection. The consolidated budget, including the FRD, is \nforecast to post a surplus of 2.4% in 2011 and 2.0% in 2012.\n\nHigher public sector wages and social payments alongside a gradual \n\nrecovery in remittance inflows will sustain domestic consumption, \nas will government plans to create many jobs through infrastructure. \nHigher import costs, a more accommodative fiscal policy, and further \ndepreciation of the local currency will stoke price pressures in 2011\u20132012. \nTo counter them, the authorities are likely to adopt a monetary policy \nthat slows money supply growth. Inflation is forecast at 8.8% in 2011 and \n8.5% in 2012.\n\nInternational prices for gold and cotton are seen peaking in 2011, \n\nbut staying high. Uzbekistan\u2019s export prices for natural gas, which \nhave approached international levels, are likely to stay at these high \nlevels. Exports are forecast to grow at 14.0% in 2011 and 3.1% in 2012, \nsupplemented by a gradual improvement in remittance inflows. The steep \nrise in public investment will likely offset the slower export growth in \n2012 in terms of contribution to GDP. \n\nGrowth in imports will be driven by expansion of infrastructure \ndevelopment and by increases in global energy and food prices. Since \nmachinery and equipment are the main import items, the post-2011 \ninvestment surge will drive imports even higher. Import growth is \ntherefore put at 11.9% in 2011 and 16.3% in 2012. The current account \nsurplus is projected at 16.3% and 12.6% of GDP.\n\nThe downside external risks to the forecasts are related to the pace \nof economic recovery in Uzbekistan\u2019s main trading partners as well as \nuncertainty in global financial markets. The immediate challenge is to \nmanage rising pressures from fiscal expansion and global food price \nincreases. To prevent unwanted fiscal-led pressure on monetary policy, \nthe authorities are ready to adapt the structure of budget expenditure and \nthe pace of nominal depreciation of the currency. \n\n3.8.1  Development challenges\n\nWith one eye on the long-term goal \nof diversifying the economy, the \ngovernment has designated 2011 as the \nyear of small businesses and private \nentrepreneurs. \n\nAccording to official statements, \nthese two groups contributed more \nthan half of total GDP and employed \nmore than 70% of the total labor force \nin 2010. The central bank reported that \ntotal lending to both groups jumped by \n40% that year to $1.7 billion. As well \nas lowering taxes, the government\u2019s \nprogram for 2011 targets better \naccess to capital for them and simpler \nreporting requirements. \n\nSources of export income, too, need \nto be broadened and natural resources \nprudently managed, as the current \nresource-based approach is susceptible \nto volatility in global commodity prices. \n\nEffective banking supervision \nand improved prudential banking \nrequirements will help to guard against \npotential risks associated with rapid \ncredit growth and greater commercial \nbank lending to state-owned \nenterprises. \n\nImproving access to credit for \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises \nwill widen the range of banking \nassets while benefiting the broader \npopulation through job opportunities.\n\n3.8.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n8.5\n\n8.8\n\n16.3\n\n2012\n\n8.4\n\n8.5\n\n12.6\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\fEAST ASIA\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nHong Kong, China \nRepublic of Korea \nMongolia \nTaipei,China \n\n\f\fPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nStrong  investment,  supported  by  an  expansion  of  private  consumption  and  net  exports,  powered  a \nreturn  to  double-digit  growth.  The  authorities  ended  the  fiscal  stimulus  program  and,  with  inflation \npressures  building,  tightened  monetary  policy.  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  moderate  both  this  year  and \nnext.  Inflation  will  rise  in  2011,  then  likely  decelerate  in  2012.  Going  beyond  the  next  2 years,  the  new \n5-year  plan  puts  more  emphasis  on  consumption  and  services  as  drivers  of  growth  and  on  reducing \nboth  income  inequality  and  pollution. \n\nEconomic performance\nBrighter than expected economic growth in the second half of 2010 \nlifted the full-year rate of expansion in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) to 10.3% in a return to the pre\u2013global recession double-digit pace. \nAll sectors recorded solid growth, led by industry with a 12.2% increase \nthat contributed about two-thirds of total GDP growth. Services \nexpanded by 9.5% and agriculture by 4.3% (the grain harvest was good, \ndespite harsh weather).\n\nFrom the demand side, investment and consumption explained 92% \nof total growth, investment being the main contributor (Figure 3.9.1). Still, \nthe winding back of the aggressive fiscal stimulus put through during the \nglobal recession slowed the growth of fixed asset investment in nominal \nterms from the very high 31.0% seen in 2009 to 24.4% in 2010.\n\nPrivate consumption grew by 11.0% in nominal terms (9.3% in real \nterms), supported by higher incomes. Sales of household appliances and \nfurnishings benefited from heavy investment in housing, while sales of \nautomobiles continued to surge. Despite several years of solid growth in \nprivate consumption, however, it remains low as a share of expenditure-\nbased GDP at 34%.\n\nNet exports contributed positively to GDP growth in 2010 (by \n\n0.8 percentage points), unlike 2009 when net exports fell as global trade \nslumped.\n\nMonetary policy supported growth, even as the authorities reined in \nthe highly expansionary stance taken during the global recession. While \nbroad money supply (M2) growth decelerated to 19.7% in 2010 from 27.7% \nin 2009, it was above the 17.0% target for 2010 of the People\u2019s Bank of \nChina (the central bank). \n\nGrowth in bank credit at CNY8 trillion also exceeded its target, \n\nby CNY0.5 trillion, although it was well below 2009\u2019s outturn \n(Figure 3.9.2).

Yet despite this, the index is still seen as understating inflation \nbecause its composition and weights have not been significantly adjusted \nto reflect the major changes in consumption patterns in the last decade.\n\nMoving to stem inflation, the central bank raised the reserve \nrequirement for banks six times in 2010 and three times in the first \nquarter of 2011 (to 20.0% for large banks). It also lifted the benchmark \ninterest rate twice in 2010 and once in the first quarter of 2011 (by a total \nof 75 basis points to 6.06%\u2014Figure 3.9.4). The government imposed price \ncontrols on some food items and increased subsidies for low-income \nearners.\n\nPrices of residential property in cities rose strongly, propelled by \nrising incomes, investment demand, and the abundant liquidity. Overall \nproperty prices climbed by an average of 10.0% in 70 major cities. Real \nestate investment surged by 33.5% in nominal terms, outpacing overall \ninvestment growth. Government actions to curb house prices included \nraising both mortgage interest rates and down payments as well as \ndirecting banks not to lend for purchases of third (or more) homes. These \nchanges damped the rate of increase during the year (Figure 3.9.5).\n\nFiscal policy was supportive of growth in 2010, although less so than \n\nin 2009 as the massive CNY4 trillion fiscal stimulus program launched \nin late 2008 came to an end. Fiscal revenue and expenditure rose by \n21.3% and 17.4%, respectively, well above the government\u2019s traditionally \nconservative targets. The strong revenue performance was a consequence \nof the robust economic growth and higher prices. The budget deficit \nnarrowed to the equivalent of 2.1% of GDP from 2.9% in 2009.\n\nGlobal recovery in trade last year saw the country\u2019s trade flows soar \nby\tnearly\t35%\tto\tabout\t$3\ttrillion.\tMerchandise\texports\tin\tnominal\tUS\t\ndollar terms rebounded by 31%.

It became Brazil\u2019s top trade partner in 2009 \nwith bilateral trade showing a more than 12-fold increase in value since \n2001. Some 85% of its exports to Brazil are manufactured products, while \nsoybeans and minerals account for two-thirds of its imports.\n\nForeign\tdirect\tinvestment\t(FDI)\treached\t$105.7\tbillion\tin\t2010,\tup\t\nby 12.4% from the previous year.

Large investments in energy-related projects in some Central \nAsian countries have turned the PRC into the second-largest investor \nthere, after the Russian Federation.\n\nThe PRC is also gaining prominence as a lender to developing \ncountries: its lending in the past 2 years exceeded that from the World \nBank (excluding the International Development Association, which makes \ngrants and low-interest loans). These operations included loan-for-oil \ndeals with Brazil, the Russian Federation, and Venezuela; power-related \nprojects in India; and infrastructure investments in Argentina and \nGhana.\n\nThe\tcurrent\taccount\tsurplus\tincreased\tto\t$306.2\tbillion,\tbut\tas\ta\tratio\t\n\nto GDP it declined to 5.2%.

In real \neffective terms the yuan appreciated by 4.2% in 2010. \n\nEfforts to internationalize the currency resulted in much higher levels \nof yuan-denominated trade, estimated at CNY70 billion in 2010 compared \nwith just CNY0.5 billion in 2009.\n\nAbout 11.7 million new jobs were generated in urban areas last year, \n\nabove the official target but fewer than the average 24 million new \njob seekers who enter the labor market each year. Average minimum \nprovincial wages rose by 24%, illustrating government efforts to raise \nliving standards and foster consumption.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015), approved in March 2011, seeks to \nrebalance the pattern of growth. Its targets indicate that the authorities \nare willing to forgo some speed of GDP growth to enhance its \nsustainability (see below). \n\nFixed asset investment is expected to remain the main driver of \ngrowth in 2011 and 2012, decelerating to 22% in 2011 and to 20% in 2012 \n(Figure 3.9.8). The expiration of the fiscal stimulus package in 2010 will \nreduce such investment by CNY2 trillion this year (or 7% of the total \nin 2010). Monetary tightening under way will also damp the high rates \nof investment. Further, the central government is scrutinizing local \ngovernment finances and investment more closely.\n\nFiscal policy will be broadly expansionary, with a higher priority on \neducation, health care, low-cost housing, and research and development. \nThe overall budget deficit is projected to be little changed at about 2% of \nGDP. \n\nInflation pressures are prompting the authorities to tighten monetary \npolicy, but their stance is expected to remain supportive of growth. They \nhave trimmed the target for growth in M2 money supply to 16% for 2011; \na similar rate is assumed for next year. For new lending, the central bank \nhas opted not to provide an annual target ceiling on new bank loans \nfor 2011. It will instead target a new measure of total credit, \u201ctotal social \nfinancing,\u201d which includes loans from trust companies, corporate bonds, \n\n3.9.6  Trade indicators\n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\nTrade balance\n\n$ billion\n90\n\n \n\n Jul\n\n  Jul\n\nJan\n09\n\n \nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n11\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 16 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n10\n\n Jul\n\n \n\n3.9.7  Exchange rates\n\nNominal\n\nCNY/$\n\nReal effective\n\n2005 = 100\n\n \n\n \n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n11\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 16 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\n \n\n \n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\n132\n\n124\n\n116\n\n108\n\n100\n\n%\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n3.9.8  Fixed asset investment growth\n\nFixed asset investment growth\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n12\n11\nForecast\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 20 March 2011); ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fBased on these projections, GDP is forecast to grow by 9.6% in 2011, \n\n3.9.9  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n122    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nand equities of nonfinancial companies.

The increase \nin merchandise exports is forecast to slow to about 20% in nominal terms \nthis year and 18% in 2012, below the near 30% average pace seen in the \n5 years before the global recession.\n\neasing to 9.2% in 2012 (Figure 3.9.9) on expectations that industrial \nproduction and fixed investment will continue to moderate.\n\nIndustrial production is expected to slow over the 2 years owing to \n\nrelatively soft external demand, overcapacity in some manufacturing \nsubsectors, and government efforts to reduce carbon emissions and other \nenvironmental damage. Nevertheless, in the first 2 months of this year, \nindustrial output grew by 14.1%, slightly above the rate in December 2010. \nIn further signs of a solid start to 2011, fixed asset investment rose \nby about 25%, investment in real estate surged by 35%, and retail sales \nincreased by 16% in the first 2 months (all in nominal terms).\n\nInflation is forecast to accelerate to 4.6% on average in 2011 \n(Figure 3.9.10), a result of higher global prices for food and oil, rising \nwages, and robust domestic demand. For the first 2 months of this year it \naveraged 4.9%, exceeding the full-year official target of 4.0%. The pace is \nexpected to ease later in 2011 mainly because of the base effect. \n\nIn 2012, inflation is projected to ebb to 4.2% owing to the anticipated \nleveling off of global oil and commodity prices as well as tighter domestic \nmonetary policy. Although the authorities are tightening to address \ninflation, they face difficulties in controlling bank liquidity and in \nmanaging inflation expectations without a nominal inflation anchor \n(Box 3.9.1).\n\nImports are expected to increase faster than exports during the \nforecast period, largely owing to high prices for imported energy and \ncommodities. The current account surplus is projected to fall to 4.6% of \nGDP this year and 4.2% next, continuing a decline from a recent peak of \n10.6% in 2007 (Figure 3.9.11) brought about mainly by faster growth in the \nvalue of imports than exports.\n\nDownside risks to the economic outlook relate mainly to the fragility \n\nof external demand (exacerbated by the modest recovery in the United \nStates), fiscal and debt concerns in the European Union (the PRC\u2019s largest \ntrading partner), and now Japan. Although data are inadequate at present \nto assess the impact of the massive earthquake and tsunami on the PRC \neconomy, they may have a short-term effect on bilateral trade, to a degree \nbecause Japanese companies in the PRC rely on spare parts and materials \nimported from Japan.\n\nThe rapid increase in local government debt to an estimated \n\nCNY7.6 trillion, stemming from the stimulus program begun in late 2008, \nis likely to lead to some rise in nonperforming loans at banks, given that \nabout one-third of the debt is estimated to be at risk.

Rapid growth over three decades has allowed for transition from \na low- to a middle-income country, but has also generated imbalances \nsuch as heavy reliance on investment, relatively low levels of private \nconsumption, underdeveloped services, widespread environmental \ndamage, and expanding income gaps.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nImplementing the 12th Five-Year Plan will be a major challenge. Its main \npolicy directions include the following: a better balance in the drivers \nof growth among investment, consumption, and exports, with services \nplaying a more important role; a stronger emphasis on improving living \nstandards and narrowing income inequalities; newly designated strategic \nindustries\u2014a modern energy industry, a comprehensive transport \nsystem, information-based industries, and biotechnology\u2014to promote \ninnovation; and plans to combat global warming and reduce carbon \nintensity, including ambitious emission-reduction targets, a carbon tax, \nnew indicators for pollutants, and carbon-trading programs.\n\nThe plan sets quantitative targets on key economic, social, and \nenvironmental indicators. It trims the GDP growth target of 7.0% for \n2011\u20132015 from 7.5% in the previous plan, a move aimed to signal the \ngovernment\u2019s willingness to sacrifice speed of growth for the sake of \nsustainability (actual GDP growth in the previous plan was 11.2%).\n\nCritical among the objectives is changing the growth pattern toward a \nmodel oriented more to services and consumption from the past emphasis \non industry and capital investment. Economic rebalancing was an \nobjective in the previous plan, and indeed some progress was made in, for \nexample, curbing energy consumption and pollutants and expanding the \ncoverage of urban and rural health care. \n\nYet there was limited progress on major rebalancing targets. \n\nConsumption, for instance, substantially lagged investment (with average \ncontributions of 41% and 54% to annual GDP growth in the past 5 years). \nOn the production side, services\u2019 share of GDP is relatively low at about \n43% (Figure 3.9.12).\n\nThe need to transform the pattern of economic growth is stronger \nnow than in 2006 both because the external imbalances have become \nmore pronounced, and because the recent global recession highlighted \nthe risks of the export-led growth paradigm. Moreover, the implications \nof population aging in the PRC threaten the sustainability of growth and \ncomplicate the reform agenda. \n\nRebalancing is, however, unlikely to occur without significant policy \n\nadjustments, including shifting the emphasis of public spending from \ninvestment to public services, liberalizing the finance sector, developing \ncapital markets to help small and medium-sized enterprises and the self-\nemployed to access credit, and facilitating a greater role for private players \nin the economy.\n\n3.9.1  Anchoring inflation \nexpectations\n\nClimbing consumer and asset prices \nin the country risk raising inflation \nexpectations, and so encouraging new \nrounds of price increases that further \nheighten expectations. Such spirals \nhave occurred in the past, leading to \n20% inflation in 1988.\n\nInternational experience suggests \nthat the best way to control inflation \nexpectations is to anchor them, \npreferably with inflation targeting \nrather than monetary targeting. \nInflation targeting allows the \n\nmonetary authorities to use all \navailable information, not just \nmonetary variables, to determine \nmonetary policy settings. \n\nIt is also transparent and readily \nunderstood by the public, increases \ncentral bank accountability (because its \nperformance can be measured against \na clearly defined target), and can help \nfocus the political debate on the main \nrole of the central bank in the long \nrun (controlling inflation instead of \nboosting economic growth). \n\nA central bank\u2019s credibility is \n\nindispensable in inflation targeting, so \nas to keep expectations well anchored.\nIn the People\u2019s Republic of China \nat the moment, accelerating inflation \nand difficulties of managing the \nhigh levels of bank liquidity suggest \nthat some anchoring of expectations \nmight now be appropriate. And \nalthough it would be premature for \nthe central bank to adopt formal \ninflation targeting\u2014given its limited \nindependence and government \ncontrols on interest rates\u2014it could \nconsider some features of an anchoring \nsystem, such as announcing an explicit \ninflation objective or target range, and \ncommitting to achieve it for several \nyears.\n\nTo increase the central bank\u2019s \ncredibility, it would need full control \nover managing its reserves, more \nleeway to liberalize interest rates, \nand greater exchange rate flexibility. \nManaging inflation expectations would \nalso require it to more clearly flag \nits monetary intentions to financial \nmarkets. \n\n\f124    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nAs the new plan reflects these reforms to some degree, the key \nchallenge lies in how to successfully carry them out in a period of \npolitical transition to a new generation of leaders in 2012\u20132013. Moreover \nthe intended reforms, although necessary, are not risk free, and might \ncreate or exacerbate policy-making trade-offs. \n\nFor instance, promoting services as a source of growth and \nemployment may entail short-term side effects such as increased \nunemployment (until the full benefits unfold in the medium to longer \nterm, when excess labor is absorbed through implementation of adequate \nsupportive policy measures, including education and training). \n\nFurther, promoting consumption as a driver of growth would require \n\nlarger salary increases, as supported in the plan, which could generate a \nwage-price spiral in the economy, trapping policy makers in a difficult \nchoice between rebalancing and price stability.\n\nClosing the income gaps is another major challenge. The benefits of \nrapid growth in the PRC have not been evenly distributed among regions, \nresulting in a skewed distribution of income in favor of coastal cities and \nurban citizens. The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality (zero \nindicates perfect equality and 1 absolute inequality) has worsened from \n0.16 in 1978 to the current 0.47. \n\nThe PRC\u2019s rapid development has also come at a significant \nenvironmental cost. Heavy dependency on coal as an energy source \nhas led to high levels of air and water pollution. The additional tens of \nmillions of new automobiles on the roads in the past few years have taken \ncarbon dioxide emissions to alarming levels. Against this background, \ngovernment plans to accelerate urbanization \u2014as stated in the new plan\u2014\nrequire greater efforts to facilitate a sustainable process of urbanization in \nthe framework of a low-carbon economy.\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\n\n3.9.12  Sector shares in current GDP, 2010\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\n\n%\n\n64\n\n48\n\n32\n\n16\n\n0\n\nPRC\n\nIND\n\nKOR\n\nMAL\n\nPHI\n\nTHA\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Rep. of China; IND = India; KOR = Republic \nof Korea; MAL = Malaysia; PHI = Philippines; \nTHA = Thailand.\nNote: Data for India are based on advance estimates.

Low  interest  rates  and \nabundant liquidity have contributed to a property-price spurt that the authorities are trying to damp with \nmacroprudential  measures  and  increased  supply  of  land  for  housing.\n\n3.10.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\n\nInvestment\nNet exports\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.0\n\n6.4\n\n6.8\n\n2.3\n\n-2.7\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSource: Census and Statistics Department. http://www.\ncenstatd.gov.hk (accessed 14 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n09\n\n10\n\nEconomic performance\nThis services-driven economy made a solid comeback in 2010 as it \nrecovered from contraction in 2009. GDP picked up by 6.8%. From the \ndemand side, consumption, investment, and net exports all contributed to \ngrowth (Figure 3.10.1).\n\nPrivate consumption grew by 5.8% and was responsible for more than \nhalf the GDP growth. Consumption spending was supported by a pickup \nin employment and buoyant stock and property markets. Retail sales were \nboosted by a 22% jump in visitor arrivals to 36 million.\n\nGovernment consumption made a small contribution to the \n\nexpansion. Budget spending in FY2010 (ending 31 March 2011) came in \nbelow allocation, while revenue burgeoned alongside the recovery in \neconomic activity and asset prices. The budget was in surplus to the tune \nof an estimated 4% of GDP.\n\nAfter 2 weak years, fixed investment rebounded by 8.1% in 2010, \naccounting for about one-quarter of GDP growth. Private investment in \nmachinery, equipment, and computer software was strong, especially in \nthe first half (reflecting the low base). Several large-scale projects boosted \npublic construction, including the Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong \nexpress rail and the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macao bridge.\n\nWith the revival of global trade, exports of goods bounced back \nto record 17.3% growth in real terms, from a double-digit contraction \na year earlier. Exports to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and \nother major Asian markets (Japan; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; \nand Taipei,China) saw growth of 15%\u201323%. Exports to the United States \nand Europe also rose, but failed to scale 2008\u2019s precrisis peak. Imports \nof goods in real terms rose by 18.1%, reflecting growth in private \nconsumption and the pickup in investment.\n\nServices exports grew by 15.0% in real terms in 2010 as financial and \nprofessional services, trade services, transport, and tourism all benefited \nfrom the recovery in global trade and deepening integration with the \nrapidly growing PRC.\n\nThe important financial and insurance subsector grew by 7.5% \n\nThis chapter was written by Arief Ramayandi and Aleli Rosario of the Economics and \nResearch Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n\f126    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nin 2010. Equity capital raised through initial public offerings rose to \nHK$449.5\tbillion\t(US$57.9\tbillion),\tmaking\tHong\tKong,\tChina\tthe\tworld\u2019s\t\nbiggest center for such capital raising last year. The subsector is benefiting \nfrom wider external use of the yuan. The number of authorized financial \ninstitutions participating in yuan business increased from 61 to 115 and \ntheir total deposits increased almost fivefold. \n\nA resumption of employment gains in 2010 (after net job losses in 2009) \n\nlowered the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to 4.0% in the fourth \nquarter (Figure 3.10.2). But real earnings grew by just 0.1% during the year.\nInflation quickened over the year to 3.1% in December 2010 owing to \n\nrising domestic demand, a softer US dollar, higher prices for imported \nfood, and rising housing costs (Figure 3.10.3). It averaged 2.4% for the year.\nVery low interest rates and abundant liquidity, coupled with strong \n\nunderlying demand for housing, propelled prices of all categories of \nproperty in 2010. Residential property prices rose by 20.4% in the \n12 months to December 2010, following a gain of 28.5% a year earlier. A \nhousing affordability index shows that houses became more expensive in \nrelation to incomes (Figure 3.10.4).\n\nConcerned that the sharp runup in prices was spilling over from the \nhigh-end property sector to the broader residential market, the authorities \ndirected banks to lower their loan-to-value ratios and raised stamp duty \non high-end housing. As prices continued to trend up, the government \nin November 2010 imposed a special stamp duty on residential property \nresold within 24 months of acquisition. To add to the supply of housing \nin the medium term, it increased the land available for residential \nconstruction. By year-end, these measures appeared to damp speculation, \nas reflected in fewer transactions.\n\nIn the external accounts, a sharply wider merchandise trade deficit \nand lower surplus in the income account offset a larger services trade \nsurplus\tin\t2010.\tThe\tcurrent\taccount\tsurplus\tdeclined\tto\tUS$14.8\tbillion\t\n(6.6% of GDP).\n\nEconomic prospects\nIn light of projected slower global trade and moderating PRC growth, \nHong Kong, China will see its expansion ease this year and next.\n\nPrivate consumption is expected to remain healthy in 2011, based \non growth in employment and incomes, and be the main contributor to \ngrowth in the economy. Retail sales in volume terms rose by 23.6% in the \nfirst month of 2011 (Figure 3.10.5) aided by inbound tourism.\n\nBusiness investment will likely expand moderately this year, \nsupported by low interest rates. Major public infrastructure projects \nbegun in the past 2 years will continue contributing to growth in the \nforecast period.\n\nSlower growth in world trade and the ending of the low-base effect on \n2010\u2019s outturn are expected to bring down growth in merchandise exports \nto about 7.5% in nominal terms in 2011 from 22.4% in 2010. Robust growth \nis foreseen for services exports, particularly to the PRC.\n\nThe budget for FY2011 includes an increase in spending of nearly 25%, \nand projects a small budget deficit.

Major infrastructure projects to begin in 2011 include extensions of \nmass transit rail lines.\n\nOn the balance of these factors, GDP growth is forecast at 5.0% in \n\n2011, easing to 4.7% in 2012, as the economy is expected to stabilize \naround its longer-term growth trend. Current account surpluses \nequivalent to 7.2%\u20137.5% of GDP are projected for the forecast period.\n\nInflation this year will be well above the average rate of just over 2% \nof the past 5 years. Hong Kong, China imports most of its food from the \nPRC, where food prices have been rising. Further, the yuan has steadily \nclimbed against the Hong Kong dollar (Figure 3.10.6), raising the cost \nof all purchases from the mainland. Higher global fuel and food prices, \nrising housing costs, and a likely increase in wages add to inflation \npressures. Inflation was 3.7% in February 2011 and is forecast to average \n4.5% for the year.\n\nIn 2012, inflation is seen easing to 3.3% as global food prices decelerate \n\nand the housing market stabilizes, the latter aided by the policies \nintroduced in 2010.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nThe Hong Kong dollar\u2019s link to the US dollar through a currency board \nframework constrains the authorities from using interest rates as a tool \nto curb property booms. Monetary policy is tied to that of the US Federal \nReserve, which is not expected to tighten much during the next 2 years. \nThe government is therefore relying on macroprudential measures to rein \nin speculation and to ensure prudent mortgage lending by banks, while it \nincreases the supply of land for housing.\n\nAcknowledging the risk of a property bubble, the financial secretary \n\nsaid in March 2011 that the government stands ready to take further \naction to calm the housing market.\n\nAs for inflation more broadly, the FY2011 budget provides several \none-time measures aimed at helping the population cope with rising costs \nof living. They include a subsidy for each residential electricity account \ncapped\tat\tHK$1,800,\twaived\trates\t(property\ttaxes)\tup\tto\tHK$6,000,\tand\t\n2 months\u2019 rent exemption for public housing tenants.

Growth  is  expected  to  moderate  to  a \nmore sustainable pace in 2011. The paramount near-term challenge is to contain emerging inflation pressures. \nA key development challenge is to create more job opportunities for those seeking work. \n\nEconomic performance\nEconomic recovery gained traction in 2010 in the Republic of Korea, \nas GDP rose by 6.1%, the sharpest increase since 2002. The exceptional \ngrowth largely reflects a rebound from below-trend growth of 2.3% in \n2008 and 0.2% in 2009. The recovery was broad-based and rested on \nboth external and domestic drivers. Externally, exports surged in tandem \nwith the rebound in the world economy and trade. Domestically, private \ndemand replaced fiscal and monetary policy stimulus pushed through \nduring the global recession. Figure 3.11.1 shows the trajectory of quarterly \ngrowth during 2008\u20132010.\n\nAmong the different sources of growth in 2010, robust investment \nplayed the dominant role, accounting for over two-thirds of the year\u2019s \nexpansion (Figure 3.11.2). Surging exports of manufactured goods drove \nthe sharp rise in investment. Private consumption accounted for the rest \nof GDP growth. Government consumption contributed less than a tenth, \nmirroring the transformation from policy-led recovery to growth based \non private demand. The impact on GDP of the stronger total demand was \npartly offset by a surge in imports of goods and services.\n\nAs global trade volume swung from sharp contraction in 2009 to \n\nexpansion in 2010, it propelled a 29.6% rise in merchandise exports \nin US dollar terms. Export performance was strong throughout the \nyear (Figure 3.11.1). Information technology-related products such as \nsemiconductors and liquid crystal displays performed particularly well. \nExports of autos, auto parts, and general machinery also grew rapidly. In \nterms of export destinations, demand from the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and Southeast Asia drove growth in the first half and held up well \nin the second. Demand from Japan and the United States also picked up \nlast year from 2009.\n\nMirroring the strong recovery of demand, imports rose sharply by \n31.9%.\tThe\tmerchandise\ttrade\tsurplus\trose\tto\tabout\t$42\tbillion,\tbut\tthe\t\ndeficit\tin\tservices\ttrade\tnearly\tdoubled\tto\t$11\tbillion.\tThe\tcurrent\taccount\t\nsurplus fell to 2.8% of GDP, from 3.9% in 2009.\n\nAn outstanding feature of growth in 2010 was the acceleration of \nequipment investment, which soared by 24.5%, though it partly reflects \na base effect from 2009, when such investment fell by 9.1%.

Companies were also spurred \nto expand facilities by a rise in manufacturing capacity utilization from \nan average of 74.6% in 2009 to 81.8% in 2010 (Figure 3.11.3). Further, an \nappreciating won against the US dollar in the second half of the year \nlowered the cost of imported capital goods. Imports of machinery rose \nsharply, although those of transport equipment grew much less quickly. \n\nConstruction investment contracted by 2.3% in 2010, after growing by \n4.4% in 2009 on the back of public works. The weakness in construction \nreflected a sluggish housing market, where the inventory of unsold \nhousing continued to build.\n\nPrivate consumption bounced back (Figure 3.11.4) to grow by 4.1% \n\nin 2010, after feeble growth in 2009, supported by a stronger labor \nmarket. Employment rose by 323,000, even as the government scaled \nback job creation programs. Real wages increased by more than 3%, after \ncontracting by 6% in 2009. Gross domestic income rose by 5.8%, the \nfastest pace in 8 years. An upturn in the stock market and appreciation of \nthe won contributed to stronger consumer sentiment.\n\nThe unemployment rate nudged up to 3.7% from 3.6% in 2009, mainly a \n\nresult of more Koreans looking for work in light of the improved outlook.\nIn terms of economic sectors, manufacturing stood out with a 14.6% \n\nincrease in production last year, fueled by surging export demand. \nServices expanded by a healthy 3.5%. \n\nDespite the strong economic growth, average inflation rose only \nslightly in 2010, to average 2.9%, within the Bank of Korea\u2019s target band \nof 2.0%\u20134.0%. As economic recovery gained traction, the central bank \nstarted to edge up its policy interest rate from the record low 2.0% set \nduring the global recession. From July 2010 to March 2011, the Bank of \nKorea raised the rate in four steps to 3.0%. \n\nEconomic prospects\nExceptionally strong growth in 2010 was based to a large extent on a \none-time base effect due to weak performance of 2009. Consequently, \nthe economy is expected to decelerate this year to more sustainable \nlevels around the potential growth rate, estimated at 4.3%\u20134.9%. A \ngenerally benign global outlook will support exports and healthy private \ninvestment, and consumption will underpin growth. The consolidation of \ngrowth and the emergence of inflation pressures mean that inflation is set \nto replace growth as the priority of policy makers.\n\nMerchandise exports are projected to grow by more than 10% in 2011. \nDemand from industrial economies will likely be subdued, but developing \ncountries are forecast to grow rapidly and provide a more certain source \nof demand. The country has diversified its export markets in recent years, \nwith the PRC in particular providing an important export market during \nthe global recession (Figure 3.11.5). \n\nExports to the PRC have traditionally been dominated by high-tech \n\nparts and components for assembly and reexport to industrialized \ncountries. Increasingly, however, the PRC is becoming a direct consumer \nof final goods, which helps to explain why the the Republic of Korea\u2019s \nexports to that market held up so well in 2009\u20132010.\n\n%\n85\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n%\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\nJan\n2009\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.11.4  Private consumption growth\n\nYear on year\nQuarter on quarter, seasonally adjusted\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2007\n\nQ1\n08\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ1\n10\n\nSource: Bank of Korea.

First, the \ncountry\u2019s exports, especially durables and capital goods, are sensitive to \nthe global business cycle, so the expected easing in world trade growth \nwill act as a drag on exports. After past global downturns, exports \ninitially responded elastically to the recovery of global growth, but lost \nsome momentum as recovery moderated. \n\nOther constraining factors for growth are an expected appreciation \n\nof the won and likely weakness in unit prices of exports. (Foreign \ncompetitors have expanded production capacity for semiconductors, \nliquid crystal displays, and other key items, which sets an upper bound to \ntheir prices.) \n\nOn the domestic front, strong consumer and business confidence will \n\nbuttress growth in private consumption and investment (Figure 3.11.6). \nHigh corporate profits in 2010 and prospective foreign capital inflows \nhave enabled firms to invest. However, as pent-up demand for investment \npostponed during the global slump was largely satisfied in 2010, \nequipment investment is likely to moderate to a more sustainable level of \nabout 8% this year. \n\nConstruction investment will likely grow at the sluggish pace of \nabout 3%. A significant inventory of unsold housing in the Seoul area will \nconstrain construction, as will large debts of private housing companies \nand the government\u2019s Land & Housing Corporation. The corporation\u2019s \ndebts are an example of a more general problem of high and growing debt \nburdens of state-owned firms (Box 3.11.1).\n\nPrivate consumption is projected to expand by 4.0%\u20134.5% in 2011, \nbolstered by growth in incomes. The labor market looks set to remain \nstrong (up to 250,000 jobs will likely be generated, down a bit from last \nyear owing to the expected moderation in growth of exports industries). \nSoftness in export unit prices will weigh on terms of trade and gross \ndomestic income. But gains in corporate profitability in 2010 will pave \nthe way for more robust wage growth. A decline in housing prices \nthat bottomed out in the second half of 2010 should support consumer \nconfidence. \n\nInflation pressures surfaced toward end-2010 and are expected to \nintensify this year. Major price indicators are on the rise (Figure 3.11.7), \nwith inflation breaching the central bank\u2019s target band in January and \nFebruary this year. Inflation in 2011 is forecast at 3.5%. It is expected to \nease a little in 2012, when monetary policy will be tighter and global \nprices for oil and food are expected to decelerate. \n\nCost-push factors such as higher global oil and food prices have \ncontributed to the rise in inflation, though aggregate demand is also \nputting upward pressure on prices. Additionally, as actual output has \nsurpassed potential output since the first quarter of 2010 (Figure 3.11.8), \nit is likely that monetary policy will be tightened further to contain \ninflation.\n\nThe authorities are also using administrative measures to control \nprices of specific items, especially food. Further, in February 2011 the \ngovernment advised that it would minimize increases in public utility \ncharges. \n\nThe fiscal stimulus has been withdrawn as the economic recovery \ngathered pace. The overall fiscal deficit was reined in last year to 2.3% \n\n3.11.6  Confidence indicators\nBusiness composite index\n\nConsumer confidence\n\n2005 = 100\n\n150\n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n11\nNote: Data for January 2008\u2013August 2008 refer to the \nConsumer Expectations Index; values after that were \nderived from the Composite Consumer Sentiment Index.\nSources: CEIC Data Company; Bank of Korea.

Such \ndebts are not part of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s \ndefinition of public debts, but still represent contingent \nliabilities for the government. \n\nAs at end-2009, these firms\u2019 total debt reached \n235.1 trillion won ($201.4 billion), equivalent to 65.4% \nof public debt. Further, their debt grew by an average of \n17.9% a year between 2004 and 2009, significantly faster \nthan the growth in public debt (12.0%) (Box figure 1).\n\n1  State-owned firms\u2019 debts and public debt\n\nState-owned firms' debt\nPublic debt\n\nGrowth in public debt\nGrowth in state-owned firms' debt\n\nWon trillion\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n%\n\n30\n\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\nCritically, the ratio of short-term debt to total debt \namong state-owned firms is relatively low (Box figure 2) \nand the duration of borrowing is relatively long.

The study was based on an \nanalysis of six of the larger firms\u2014in land and housing, \ngas, electricity, railways, highways, and petroleum\u2014which \ntogether account for 87.5% of state-owned firms\u2019 total \nassets and 92.9% of their total debts. As much of their \ngrowth has been financed by borrowing, the weighted \ndebt-to-capital ratio of the six rose from 106.3% in 2004 to \n196.8% in 2009. \n\nA high debt burden is not necessarily a concern, \n\nState-owned firms generally have low profit rates, \nalthough with wide variations. Of the six, the highways \nand petroleum firms have low debt and high profits. \nProfitability of the other four has declined in recent years \ndue to excessive business expansion and restrictions on \npublic utility tariff increases. \n\nWithout a severe shock, the risk of liquidity problems \n\nor bankruptcy among the 21 firms owned by the \ngovernment appears limited in the short run. \n\nIn the long run, however, they should strive to improve \n\nprofitability so as to gradually reduce their debt burdens. \nWhile they are somewhat constrained from raising prices \nby public interest considerations, they should nevertheless \noperate along more commercial lines. (For political reasons \nthe government is unlikely to be able to privatize them.) \n\nhowever, if there is enough liquidity to deal with \nshort-term financial difficulties. Also, if profitability is high \nenough to allow for a gradual reduction of the debt burden, \nthe risk that burden poses to fiscal sustainability is limited.\n\nIt would therefore be helpful if the government allowed \na gradual liberalization of public utility tariffs. Such firms \nshould also become much more transparent about their \nfinancial health. \n\nof GDP, from 5.1% in 2009. The government aims to further narrow the \ndeficit in 2011 and it targets a balanced budget by 2014. \n\nOn the basis of the above factors, GDP growth for 2011 is projected \nto moderate to 4.6% (Figure 3.11.9), slightly exceeding the average of 4.3% \nduring 2003\u20132007.

The outlook \nfor 2012 is expected to be broadly similar to 2011\u2019s.\n\nThe primary source of uncertainty involves monetary policy. The cost \nof keeping interest rates low, in terms of the impact on inflation, is likely \nto be significantly higher than in 2010. The GDP outcome will therefore \npartly depend on how the central bank resolves the trade-off between \ngrowth and inflation. \n\nThe large size and volatility of capital inflows remain a risk, although \n\nmacroprudential measures adopted by the authorities are mitigating it. \nFor example, tax exemptions for foreign investors that were introduced \nin May 2009 to promote bond market development are being rolled \nback, and the government has set a ceiling on foreign exchange\u2013related \nderivatives to limit banks\u2019 short-term foreign borrowing. External risks \ncenter on the trajectory of global commodity prices and recovery of \nindustrialized countries. \n\nThe impact of the Japanese disaster will be limited and temporary. \nWhile exports that compete with Japan, such as autos and electronics, \nmay benefit, disruptions to imports of capital goods will hurt \nmanufacturers. \n\nDevelopment challenges\nA key driver of private consumption growth in 2010 was the strong \nlabor market. Growth of employment and wages is also expected to be a \nmajor positive factor in 2011, but paradoxically many job seekers cannot \nfind work. A broad definition of work seekers includes the unemployed, \nthose who work fewer than 36 hours a week and want to work more, and \npeople who have never been employed or been out of the workforce for \na long time but want to work. Their number shot up by 19.1% in 2009 \nto 1.8 million people, and rose by a further 5.4% in 2010, despite the \neconomic recovery (Figure 3.11.10).\n\nSeveral policy options can be considered. First, specialized skill \ntraining programs at small and medium-sized enterprises could be \npromoted for youths, especially high-school graduates, along with \nretraining for older individuals. This is important because youths and \nolder people together accounted for around one fourth of work seekers in \n2010, according to a study by Hyundai Research Institute. \n\nSecond, an expansion of public child care facilities would enable more \nwomen with children to stay in work (the share of females in work seekers \nrose from 39% in 2009 to 43% in 2010).\n\nThird, given that unemployment became more prevalent among those, \n\nespecially females, with junior college or higher education, education \nmust become better aligned with the needs of employers. Employment \ninformation, too, should be made more widely available at universities \nand colleges. \n\nFourth, efforts should be made to facilitate the employment of those \n\nwork seekers formerly employed by public job-creation programs. \n\nFifth, internship programs in both public and private sectors should \n\nbe expanded as they give valuable work experience to those who have \nnever worked before (individuals unemployed for less than a year \naccounted for the largest share of work seekers). \n\n\fMongolia\n\nRising  global  prices  of  minerals  and  strong  investment  in  mining  contributed  to  a  return  of  economic \ngrowth  in  2010.  These  factors,  coupled  with  a  surge  in  fiscal  spending,  will  spur  higher  GDP  growth  this \nyear,  too.  Inflation  accelerated  to  double-digit-levels  in  2010  and  is  expected  to  be  even  higher  this  year. \nRapidly  rising  prices  and  fiscal  discipline  are  near-term  challenges  for  policy  makers.\n\nEconomic performance\nA 6.1% recovery in GDP in 2010 was driven by growth in the minerals \nsector, high prices for mineral exports (Figure 3.12.1), and support from \ndevelopment partners. The outcome was a turnaround from a 1.3% \ncontraction in the economy in 2009.\n\nMining benefited from a rebound in copper prices, strong external \ndemand for coal and iron ore, and construction at Oyu Tolgoi, which \nwill be one of the world\u2019s biggest copper and gold mines. Copper prices \nreturned\tto\t2008\tlevels\tearly\tlast\tyear\tand\trose\tto\tover\t$9,000\ta\tton\tin\t\nDecember 2010. Copper export volumes in 2010 were little changed from \n2009, but their value jumped by more than 50%; export volumes of coal \nand iron ore more than doubled in 2010. Strong economic growth in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Mongolia\u2019s major trading partner, \nunderpinned the increase in mineral exports.\n\nIndustry as a whole contributed nearly half the growth in GDP in \n2010 (Figure 3.12.2) as construction and manufacturing expanded, along \nwith mining. Services accounted for the rest of GDP growth: wholesale \nand retail trade recovered strongly as the economy bounced back.\n\nAgriculture, however, which directly supports about one-third of the \n\npopulation of 2.8 million, was hit by severe winter conditions (a dzud) \nthat reduced livestock numbers by about a quarter to 32.7 million. The \nsector\u2019s overall output contracted by nearly 17%. An estimated 10,000 \nhouseholds headed by livestock herders lost their livelihood and migrated \nto urban areas. The livestock losses also hurt the cashmere industry, \nreducing production of raw cashmere by 13.2% and output of cashmere \nsweaters by 20%.\n\nEconomic recovery was supported by an SDR 153.3 million (about \n$229\tmillion)\t18-month\tstand-by\tarrangement\twith\tthe\tInternational\t\nMonetary Fund, completed in September 2010.

Higher imports stemmed from the \nneed for equipment in the mining industry, as well as rising prices of oil \nand food.\n\nDeficits in trade in goods and services caused the current account \ngap to widen to 15.3% of GDP in 2010 (Figure 3.12.3).

(Reserves were just \n$637\tmillion\tat\tend-2008.)\n\nInflation accelerated to nearly 13% by end-2010 (Figure 3.12.4), and \naveraged 10.1%. The loss of livestock during the dzud, coupled with an \noutbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease, caused a sharp runup in food prices. \nStrengthening domestic demand was reinforced in October when the \ngovernment raised public sector wages by 30%. M2 money supply surged \nby nearly 63% over the year.\n\nappreciation in the togrog against the US dollar in 2010 (the country has a \nmanaged floating exchange rate). As the economy recovered and inflation \nquickened, the Bank of Mongolia in May 2010 raised its policy interest \nrate from 10.0% to 11.0%.\n\nHigher commodity prices and cash prepayments from the Oyu \nTolgoi mine contributed to a 54.5% surge in government revenue in \n2010. Government spending went up by 31.7%, largely the result of cash \ntransfers and increases in public sector wages and pensions. The budget \nwas roughly in balance (Figure 3.12.5).\n\nEconomic recovery generated jobs and lowered the unemployment \n\nrate, though it was still high at 8.6% at end-2010. Poverty remains \nwidespread, with about one-third of the population living below the \nnational poverty line. There has been progress on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals related to education and health, but achievements on \nthe poverty, malnutrition, and environmental goals are trailing.\n\nImprovements in business optimism and in public trust in banks \nencouraged a recovery in lending and strong gains in togrog deposits. \nNonperforming loans and loans in arrears fell to about 15% of total loans. \nNew banking and central bank laws were approved in February 2010 to \nimprove bank regulation and supervision. A bank-restructuring strategy, \ndrafted by the central bank, awaits approval by Parliament.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is expected to accelerate in 2011 and 2012, supported by high \nglobal mineral prices, development of new mines, and fiscal spending.\nMining is the key driver.

At full capacity, Tavan Tolgoi could produce \n15 million tons of coal a year. A state-owned company is expected to mine \nin one part of Tavan Tolgoi from this year, and international mining \ncompanies are bidding to develop another part.\n\nThe government has ambitious plans for a new rail line linking into \nthe Russian Federation\u2019s rail network and so through to its Pacific ports. \nIt also plans to build an industrial complex, including a copper smelter, \noil refinery, and facilities to process metals and produce construction \nmaterials.

The rail line and industrial complex would, however, \nrequire\tinvestment\tof\tmore\tthan\t$10\tbillion,\tand\ttheir\teconomic\tviability\t\nand financing are uncertain.\n\nFiscal policy is highly expansionary this year. The 2011 budget, with a \ndeficit equivalent to almost 10% of GDP, includes a 35% boost in spending. \nCash allowances through the government\u2019s Human Development Fund \nare budgeted to almost double from 2010. Disbursements include a \nmonthly\tcash\tallowance\tof\tMNT21,000\t(about\t$16)\tfor\tevery\tcitizen\tand\t\npartial tuition support for each college student. Government expenditure \noverall is projected to rise from 37.3% of GDP in 2010 to 52.0% in 2011, \nwhile revenue is set to climb from 37.3% to 42.0%.\n\nAgriculture is expected to recover from the impact of last year\u2019s severe \n\nweather. The government is providing support for farm-based livestock \nhusbandry, attempting to mitigate weather-related risks.\n\nTaking these factors into account, GDP growth is forecast to grow \n\nby a rapid 10% in 2011. High rates of inflation and an increasingly \nnegative real policy interest rate suggest that the central bank will tighten \nmonetary policy. It raised the reserve requirement for banks from 5.0% \nto 9.0% in February 2011. Further tightening is likely to contribute to a \nmoderation in GDP growth in 2012, projected at about 8.0%.\n\nHigh food prices, hikes in government spending (notably the cash \npayments), and the increasing cost of imported fuel are likely to result in \nvery high inflation in 2011, averaging 17%. On the assumption of further \nmonetary tightening this year, inflation should decelerate in 2012, but is \nprojected to remain elevated at 14.0% (Figure 3.12.6).\n\nRobust mineral exports projected for 2011 will be offset by an increase \n\nin imports of supplies and equipment for mining, as well as the rising \ncost of imported food and fuel. The current account deficit is seen at \nabout 15% through the forecast period. Its main sources of financing will \nbe foreign direct investment and public and private sector borrowing \nfrom abroad.\n\nThe togrog could come under further upward pressure, undermining \n\nnonmineral industries, including cashmere and textiles.\n\nParliament last year enacted a fiscal stability law to improve the \nmanagement of volatile revenue inflows from minerals and to help avoid \nthe boom\u2013bust instability that is common in mineral-based economies.\nThe law should foster budget discipline by effectively placing ceilings \n\non spending growth, the fiscal deficit, and public debt. It also requires \ncost estimates for spending proposals to ensure consistency with the \nmedium-term fiscal framework. A fiscal stability fund will be established \nto accumulate revenue saving, to be tapped during economic downturns. \nMost of the fiscal stability law\u2019s measures do not apply until 2013, however.\n\n\f136    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nAs for monetary policy, the new central bank law mandates the \nBank of Mongolia to focus solely on price stability. Inflation targeting, \ncoupled with a flexible exchange rate, should provide an appropriate \nmonetary framework, which will take some time to establish. The \nmonetary authorities have a tentative timetable to introduce inflation \ntargeting in 2012.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nThe direction of fiscal policy is of increasing concern. Very high levels of \ngovernment expenditure planned for 2011 are procyclical and may become \na source of macroeconomic instability by fueling inflation, demand for \nimports, and exchange rate volatility.\n\nPolicies to develop minerals and promote economic diversification \n\nneed to be balanced with sound macroeconomic management and \nprevention of boom\u2013bust cycles. It is important to bring fiscal policy \ninto line with the fiscal stability law and establish a sound medium-term \nbudget framework.\n\nProtecting the poor from the impact of rising prices and enabling \ntheir full inclusion in economic growth through greater employment are \nother objectives. Proposed measures to better target entitlement payments \nwould mitigate the impact of high inflation.\n\nPutting the banking system on a stronger foundation will require \n\nfollow-through on the structural reforms proposed for the sector.\n\nThe \u201cDutch disease\u201d risk common to mineral-based economies is \n\nlikely to remain on the horizon. In this scenario, rapid increases in \nexports of minerals put upward pressure on the exchange rate and \ninflation, draw resources away from nonmineral sectors, and generate a \nstream of government revenue available for subsidies and handouts. The \noutcome can be uncompetitive nonmineral industries and overextended \ngovernment budgets (particularly when global mineral prices turn down).\n\n\fTaipei,China\n\nA  powerful  recovery  last  year  reflected  a  rebound  in  domestic  demand  and  a  surge  in  exports.  Growth \nwill  moderate  this  year,  owing  to  the  high  base  set  in  2010.  Inflation  has  picked  up,  but  is  forecast  at \nrelatively modest levels. The outlook is improved  by tariff  reductions  on  exports  to the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  (PRC)  and  the  opening  of  more  industries  to  investment  from  there.\n\nEconomic performance\nThis trade-dependent economy rebounded vigorously from recession in \n2009. Surging demand for its manufactured exports in 2010 drove a burst \nof investment and supported increased private consumption. The 10.8% \nrise in GDP\u2014the fastest in almost a quarter century\u2014was partly a result \nof the low-base effect from the contraction in the previous year.\n\nPrivate investment soared by nearly 33% in 2010, after contracting \nin 2009, with substantial increases in manufacturing, information and \ncommunications, and construction. Public investment also rose, albeit \nmodestly, as the authorities continued with infrastructure spending, \nincluding reconstruction in areas hit by the severe Typhoon Morakot of \nAugust 2009. Overall, higher gross fixed capital formation contributed \nmost of the boost to GDP in 2010 (6.1 percentage points of the total) \n(Figure 3.13.1).\n\nRebounding exports and manufacturing spurred employment and \nincome growth, in turn buttressing private consumption. Unemployment \ndeclined to 4.7% by end-year, from 5.7% the previous year. Real average \nmonthly earnings in manufacturing rose by 7.5% in 2010, after declines \nin the 2 previous years. The stronger labor market buoyed consumer \nconfidence (Figure 3.13.2). Private consumption grew by 3.7% in 2010 and \nadded 2.1 percentage points to GDP growth.\n\nSectorally, growth was dominated by manufacturing (constituting \n\nabout 84% of industry), which surged by 26.8% and contributed \n7.2 percentage points to GDP growth. Construction increased by 10.9%, \nthough its contribution to GDP was slight, as it is a much smaller \nindustry. Services grew by 4.8%, with wholesale and retail trading the \nmajor contributors to growth in this sector.\n\nStrong global demand for manufactured goods drove growth of nearly \n\n40% in exports of electronic products and chemicals, and increases of \nover 30% in metal products and plastics.

Of greater concern was a surge in residential property \nprices (Figure 3.13.5) caused mainly by speculative buying. The authorities \nmoved to curb bank lending for second homes and directed banks to \nreduce loan-to-valuation ratios for such properties, which helped to damp \nspeculation.\n\nGovernment expenditure fell by 0.8% in 2010 from 2009, as the \nauthorities gradually withdrew 2009\u2019s fiscal stimulus measures.

The population in \nSingapore is aging faster, but an active immigration policy there means \nthat labor is projected to add to its growth in the long term, while the \nreduction in the Taipei,China labor force will lower its growth.\n\nTo address this issue, some local authorities, such as Taipei city, are \nproviding conditional cash transfers to households with pre-school-age \nchildren to encourage women, in particular, not to quit work when they \nhave children.

Inflation  increased  (toward  fiscal \nyear-end), driven largely by import prices. The fiscal position continued to improve but a run on deposits \nat  the  leading  private  bank  revealed  a  significant  macroeconomic  risk.  The  government  presented \nan  Afghan-led  plan  for  development  at  the  Kabul  Conference  of  donors,  but  low  implementation \ncapacity,  weak  public  sector  governance,  and  perceptions  of  widespread  corruption  raise  concerns  over \nimplementation. Sustainable, self-reliant growth requires significant improvements in security, progress in \nthe  Afghan-led  reconciliation  process,  and  a  better  private  sector  environment. \n\nEconomic performance \nGDP continued to grow strongly, at 8.2% estimated for FY2010 (ending 20 \nMarch 2011), following high growth of 20.4% in FY2009 (Figure 3.14.1). \nPrivate consumption remained the economy\u2019s main driver, based on \ncontinued high external assistance inflows and security spending \nthat fueled demand for production of goods and services, including \nconstruction. The wheat harvest was above average, but agricultural \ngrowth was below FY2009\u2019s record. \n\nThe size of the opium economy (not included in the official figures \nfor economic activity) had been declining since 2007 because of crop-\nsubstitution policies, but in 2010 its farm gate price more than doubled, \nowing to plant disease\u2013related lower production levels. This boosted \nfarmers\u2019 opium-sourced income, likely complicating the already slow pace \nof poppy eradication. \n\nIn the early months of FY2010 the price deflation of the previous \nfiscal year continued. Prices began to rise from about May 2010, heavily \ninfluenced by food and then by fuel, reflecting rising import prices. \nAlthough inflation is projected to average 8.2% in FY2010, in February \n2011 prices were 17.9% higher than a year earlier (20.9% food and 13.7% \nnonfood \u2014Figure 3.14.2). \n\nAfghanistan maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime. The \nafghani appreciated by around 10% against the US dollar over the period \nJanuary 2010\u2013February 2011, on high inflows of foreign exchange in the \nform of donor grants and remittances and on increased demand for \ndomestic currency (Figure 3.14.3). This appreciation, alongside inflation \nnow higher than among trade partners, is causing the real effective \nexchange rate to appreciate as well, potentially undermining exports. \n\nTo achieve stability both in domestic prices and the exchange rate, \nDa Afghanistan Bank, the central bank, targets reserve money (bank \nreserves and currency in circulation) as its key monetary tool, relying on \nthe issue of its capital notes and foreign currency auctions to control the \n\nThis chapter was written by Rehman Rahmani and Tia Raappana of the Afghanistan \nResident Mission, ADB, Kabul; and Nina Clare Fenton of the Central and West Asia \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.14.1  GDP growth\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\n\n8.2\n\n14.2\n\n3.4\n\n20.4\n\n8.2\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.14.2  Kabul inflation\n\nOverall\n\nFood\n\nNonfood\n\n%\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n%\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n-25\n\nJun\n\nJun\n\nJun\n\nJun\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\nJan\n09\n11\nSources: Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation & Livestock. \nAgricultural Commodity Price Bulletin. http://mail.gov.af; \nCentral Statistical Office of Afghanistan; Da Afghanistan \nBank.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fNominal exchange rate\n\n144    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nmoney supply. The absence of price pressures at the start of the fiscal year \nallowed it to adopt a relatively expansionary monetary stance for FY2010, \nin order to accommodate an increase in demand for money stemming \nfrom expected economic growth. It targeted reserve money growth in \nFY2010 at 18.9%, 1.8 percentage points higher than in FY2009. \n\nIn view of inflation pressures, however, the central bank is expected \n\nto increase interventions in the market. Gross international reserves \nclimbed\tto\t$5.0\tbillion\tat\tend-March\t2011\t(a\trise\tof\t19%\tfrom\t12\tmonths\t\nearlier), reflecting higher donor inflows. Reserves are sufficient to finance \n14.3 months of imports and can facilitate market intervention to stabilize \nthe economy and currency. \n\nA run on deposits at Kabul Bank, the largest private bank, in the \nsecond half of 2010 raised concerns about financial stability, highlighting \nthe need to strengthen central bank supervision (Box 3.14.1). Although the \ngovernment took steps to stabilize the crisis, the bank\u2019s losses (stemming \nfrom serious weaknesses in its corporate governance and management) \ncould constitute a heavy fiscal burden.\n\nFollowing a surge in domestic revenue collection in FY2009, the \ngovernment continued to improve in this area, and collection is expected \nto reach 9.8% of GDP in FY2010 (Figure 3.14.4). The good performance \nwas driven by improved tax administration, including a levying of \nbusiness receipts tax at borders and other structural reforms. Still, the \nfiscal position (excluding grants) remains among the world\u2019s weakest. \nDevelopment expenditure is almost fully funded by external assistance \nwhile fiscal sustainability\u2014domestic revenue as a share of recurrent \nspending\u2014is expected to decline to around 65% in FY2010 from 72% a \nyear earlier. \n\nThis decline is due to upward pressures on recurrent spending, mainly \n\nfrom the higher wage bill owing to the expansion of the Afghan security \nforces and the rollout of pay and grading reforms for civil servants. \nSteps toward fiscal sustainability are particularly important given plans \nto transit to Afghan-led security, since most International Security \nAssistance Force nations are setting dates for withdrawing their troops.\nAt conferences in London and Kabul in January and July 2010, the \ngovernment presented refinements to its Afghan-led medium-term plan \nfor development and announced results-based national priority programs \nto meet its objectives. It also set out public financial-management reforms. \n\nOnly an estimated 20% of donor funds are channeled, however, \n\nthrough the government budget, and to increase this share (as committed \nat the Kabul Conference), the government needs to greatly improve \nits implementation capacity. It also needs to address broader issues \nof transparency and accountability in the public sector, including \nstrengthening audits on the use of domestic funds. \n\nThe current account deficit (excluding grants) is estimated to have \n\nnarrowed from 43.6% to 37.6% of GDP in FY2010 (Figure 3.14.5). The \nnarrowing trend reflects the fact that grant-related imports (and grant \nfinancing), though increasing in US dollars, are falling relative to nominal \nGDP. Including grants, the current account balance varies only slightly: \nit is expected to run a small surplus of 1.9% of GDP in FY2010, switching \nfrom a deficit of 1.4%.  \n\nDuring the fiscal year imports increased by 3.7%.

Exports (much smaller than imports) rose by \n6.9%; the main items remained dried fruits, carpets, and furs.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth rates for FY2011 and FY2012 are projected at 8.0% and 8.5%, \nrespectively. These estimates assume that substantial development-partner \nfunding continues; agriculture and services perform well; the resolution \nof the Kabul Bank crisis is not disruptive; and industry improves, aided \nby mining-related construction. \n\nIf managed effectively, mining has the potential to grow robustly, \nalthough its contribution to the budget over the next few years is likely to \nbe modest. The World Bank estimates that even in a low-impact scenario \nthe first significant investment, the Aynak copper mine, could generate \nbudget\trevenue\tof\taround\t$155\tmillion\ta\tyear\tin\tthe\tconstruction\tphase\t\n(2011\u20132015),\tincreasing\tto\t$365\tmillion\tfrom\troyalties\tonce\tthe\tmine\t\nis operating. The Hajigak iron ore mine, too, may bring in revenue of \n$89\tmillion\ta\tyear\tafter\tit\tstarts\tconstruction\tin\t2013.\tIn\tthe\tearly\tyears\tof\t\ndevelopment, combined receipts from these two mines could therefore be \nover 1% of GDP, but that amount is contingent on strong management.\nThe government expects in the next few years to make progress on \nrevenue collection, particularly by the possible introduction of a value-\nadded tax, and to increase its fiscal sustainability ratio to above 70%. \nThe tax take should also benefit from increased mining activity, largely \nthrough indirect tax revenue in the construction phase. Meeting the \n70% target will, though, be challenging under continued pressure on \nrecurrent expenditure. Although external assistance is set to gradually \ndecline, it is likely to be needed to cover at least part of such spending \nfor several years. \n\nForeign aid will continue to plug the balance-of-payments gap. The \n\ncurrent account surplus is expected to fall slightly in FY2011, to 1.4% \nof GDP (including official transfers), driven by increased imports as \ninternational commodity prices rise. Excluding official transfers, the \nbalance should continue its gradual improvement to a deficit of 34.4% of \nGDP as development assistance falls relative to the size of the economy \n(though nominally it expands).\n\nInflation is projected to average 9.8% and 9.1% in FY2011 and FY2012, \nassuming that prudent monetary policy is adopted as planned and that it \ncan mitigate the impact of rising international commodity prices. \n\nThe previous program of the International Monetary Fund ended in \nSeptember 2010; the government has therefore requested a new Extended \nCredit Facility, though the Kabul Bank crisis has delayed a board \ndecision. \n\nThe government\u2019s economic program is likely to set out key actions \non resolving Kabul Bank\u2019s position and strengthening broader financial \nsupervision measures, while keeping a focus on macroeconomic stability \nobjectives and measures toward fiscal sustainability. \n\nThis outlook is subject to several risks, such as worsening security \n\nconditions, political instability, weak governance, loss of export \n\n3.14.1  Kabul Bank crisis\n\nFraudulent loans came to light at \nKabul Bank in September 2010, \ntriggering a run on deposits. Despite \nthis huge change to its financial \nposition, the bank still has the largest \ndeposits and branch network in \nthe country, and performs crucial \nfunctions such as paying civil service \nsalaries. \n\nThe central bank initially placed \nKabul Bank under a conservatorship \nuntil the bank could be sold to a \nqualified buyer, or, in the worst case, \nliquidated. \n\nThe government has so far \n\nguaranteed $400 million of the bank\u2019s \ndeposits but it will probably also need \nto finance any remaining unfunded \nliabilities at the time of a sale.\n\nAn alternative option, proposed \n\nby the International Monetary \nFund, would be to place the bank \nin receivership, which could be \nexpected to ensure more transparent, \nlegally secure, and potentially faster \nresolution.\n\nImportantly, any improper \nfinancial and legal interests would \nbe unquestionably resolved and \nany further losses prevented. The \ngovernment\u2019s financial exposure could \nalso be limited to a predetermined \nlevel. In March 2011, the option of \nreceivership was being considered by \nthe Afghan authorities. \n\n3.14.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n8.0\n\n9.8\n\n1.4\n\n8.5\n\n9.1\n\n-0.8\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\f146    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\ncompetitiveness, and new barriers to trade with neighboring countries. \nThe debt relief granted to Afghanistan under the extended heavily \nindebted poor countries initiative in 2010 has relieved the debt burden \nby\t$1.6\tbillion,\ttaking\tit\tto\ta\tsustainable\tlevel\t(around\t8%\tof\tGDP).\tStill,\t\nAfghanistan will stay at high risk of debt distress, particularly if foreign \ngrants (expected to decrease gradually in the medium term) fall heavily.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nIt is important that the government continues to undertake a strong \nreform agenda and implement the commitments made at the Kabul \nConference. A particular focus should be on strengthening governance, \nimplementation capacity, and accountability of public institutions. The \ngovernment\u2019s development plan should help to ensure that the budget is \nclearly focused on key policy objectives. Capacity should be strengthened \nto increase development budget implementation by at least 10%\u201320% \nannually, as committed to at the Kabul Conference. At the same time, \nthe national budget process should build on existing systems to better \nmonitor spending effectiveness. \n\nIf significant progress were made on all these fronts, development \npartners would channel more funds through the government budget, \nhelping to align development priorities and increase aid effectiveness.\n\nExternal assistance is expected to decline over the long term, hence \nthe government needs to focus on the transition to fiscal sustainability. \nIt is expected to continue improving its position by increasing domestic \nrevenue and controlling public expenditure through a robust budget-\nformulation process. \n\nThe government will also want to improve the overall investment \nclimate, so as to encourage private sector growth, promote exports, and \nreduce dependence on external assistance. The country still ranks the \nlowest in the region for ease of doing business, according to the World \nBank\u2019s Doing Business 2011 report, and this needs to change.

Doing Business 2011. \n\n\fBangladesh\n\nA  strong  export  rebound  will  push  up  growth  in  FY2011,  but  a  slowing  remittance  expansion  will \ndamp  domestic  demand.  Next  year  could  see  better  prospects  with  higher  external  demand.  A  major \nchallenge for policy makers will be to balance the needs for taming inflation and for ensuring that credit \nto  the  private  sector  is  not  stifled.  To  harness  the  country\u2019s  medium-term  growth  potential,  removing \ninfrastructure  gaps  will  be  essential,  as  will  enhancing  the  supply  of  skilled  human  resources.\n\nEconomic performance\nAt 5.8% in FY2010 (ended June 2010), GDP growth was marginally higher \nthan the 5.7% of FY2009 (Figure 3.15.1). Helped by favorable weather \nand continued government support, strong performance by the crop \nand horticulture subsector boosted agriculture\u2019s expansion. This offset \na decline in industrial growth due to a fall in external demand and \ncontinued shortages of power, gas, and transport facilities. Services also \ngrew only marginally. \n\nOn the demand side, growth was again driven by private consumption \naided by higher credit flows to the private sector (supporting job creation) \nand by a boost to public sector wages. Total fixed investment, after \nremaining stagnant over the past half a decade, rose from 24.4% of GDP \nin FY2009 to 25.0% in FY2010. The rise in private investment provided the \nmain impetus to performance. \n\nForeign\tdirect\tinvestment\tis\tstagnant\tat\tless\tthan\t$1\tbillion\ta\tyear.\t\nIt could see a notable rise, however, if the government makes progress \nin awarding contracts for gas exploration and in setting up a floating \nliquefied natural gas terminal, as called for in its plans to address growing \npower and gas shortages. Foreign as well as local investment could also be \nlifted by the Special Economic Zone Act that Parliament passed in 2010, \nwhich aims to attract more private capital. \n\nAnnual average inflation edged up to 7.3% in FY2010 from 6.7% in \nFY2009 owing to a rapid rise in food prices in the first part of the year; \nnonfood inflation moderated. In FY2011, year-on-year inflation fell to \n7.3% in July (Figure 3.15.2), from 8.7% in June but subsequently trended \nupward (with some volatility) to reach 9.0% in January 2011. The rise in \nglobal food and commodity prices, a continued rapid expansion in private \ncredit, and depreciation of the taka pushed up prices. \n\nTo help the poor and vulnerable cope with higher food prices, the \ngovernment stepped up food distribution operations, strengthened open-\nmarket sales of its inventories, and introduced a food-ration system for \nthe ultra-poor. \n\nFY2010\u2019s rapid growth in broad money continued into FY2011, \nreaching 21.7% in December 2010 (Figure 3.15.3), significantly above the \n\nThis chapter was written by Mohammad Zahid Hossain, Shamsur Rahman, and \nMd.

Private credit, up by 27.6% \nyear on year in December 2010 (against the target of 16.0%) was the main \ncontributing factor. The central bank\u2019s tightening of policy rates had \nlittle effect on credit expansion. The average lending and deposit rates \nalso remained largely unchanged at 11.2% and 6.0%, respectively, in June\u2013\nDecember 2010. \n\nRevenue collection rose briskly with the revenue-to-GDP ratio \nclimbing to 11.5% in FY2010\u2014meeting the budget target\u2014as domestic \neconomic activity picked up a little and tax administration improved. \nTotal spending jumped from 14.3% of GDP in FY2009 to 16.0% in FY2010 \nas the government adopted an expansionary fiscal stance to offset the \nimpact of the global recession. Spending fell short, however, of the budget \ntarget as the annual development program remained underspent because \nof the lingering weak capacity in key implementing agencies. The fiscal \ndeficit of 4.5% of GDP was well within the target of 5.0%. \n\nAfter declining in the first half of FY2010, exports grew consistently \nyear on year during the second half, posting growth of 4.2% for the full \nyear (but still much lower than the previous year\u2019s 10.1%). Readymade \ngarment exports moved up by only 1.2%, shaving their dominant share \nof total exports by 2 percentage points to 77.1% in FY2010. Exports of jute \ngoods, petroleum by-products, and engineering products rose briskly. \nImports contracted during the first 3 quarters but reversed this \ntrend in the fourth to show full-year growth of 5.4%, as imports of \ncapital machinery picked up. Import bills for rice and for consumer and \nintermediate goods fell from their year-earlier levels. Remittance growth, \nrobust at 22.8% in the first half of the fiscal year, decelerated sharply later, \nposting only 13.4% full-year growth, down from 22.4% the previous year. \nStill, the small expansion in the trade deficit was more than offset by \n\nremittance\tinflows,\tboosting\tthe\tcurrent\taccount\tsurplus\tto\t$3.7\tbillion\t\n(3.7%\tof\tGDP)\tfrom\t$2.4\tbillion\t(2.7%)\tin\tFY2009\t(Figure\t3.15.4).\tThe\t\nimproved position, alongside the lower deficit in the combined capital \nand financial account, pushed the overall balance-of-payments surplus to \n$2.9\tbillion\tand\tforeign\texchange\treserves\tto\t$10.7\tbillion\t(Figure\t3.15.5)\t\nat end-June 2010, raising import cover to about 5 months. In the first half \nof FY2011 foreign exchange reserves showed little increase as the current \naccount surplus largely fell away.\n\nThe nominal taka\u2013dollar exchange rate remained stable in FY2010, \n\nbut depreciated by 2.6% in the first 8 months of FY2011. Nonetheless, \nwith domestic inflation higher than in major trading partners, the real \neffective exchange rate appreciated by 1.8% year on year in January 2011, \nimplying some erosion in export competitiveness. \n\nThe Dhaka Stock Exchange general index more than doubled during \nFY2010 (Figure 3.15.6).

The government will step up initiatives to boost \npower generation (including commissioning rental power plants), \nthereby easing power supply shortages, and will take action to address \ngas shortfalls. A stable political environment and normal weather \nconditions are assumed. \n\nGDP growth in FY2011 is projected to climb to 6.3% from 5.8% the \nprevious year. The strong rebound in exports under way will support \nhigher growth, offsetting the effects on domestic demand of the sharp \nslowdown in remittance growth. The pickup in export-linked domestic \nindustries and tax incentives for domestic industries provided in the \nFY2011 budget are also expected to bolster economic activity. GDP growth \nin FY2012 is seen rising further, to 6.7% (Figure 3.15.7), with a continued \npolicy focus on growth and a pickup in external demand. \n\nAgricultural growth in FY2011 is expected to ease to 4.1% because \n\nof lower acreage sown for the aus (summer crop), shrinkage in acreage \nand inadequate rainfall for the aman (monsoon crop), and the high base \nfollowing the previous year\u2019s growth of 4.7%. In FY2012, the sector\u2019s \ngrowth is expected to strengthen to 4.3%, responding to higher prices \nfollowing a tighter supply situation in FY2011 and continued policy \nsupport.\n\nIndustrial growth is expected to rise to 7.5% in FY2011, reflecting \n\nhigher production for exports and domestic capacity expansion \nafter the previous year\u2019s higher investment. Export performance was \nbuoyant in the first 8 months of the fiscal year, recording 40.3% growth \n(Figure 3.15.8), with all major items growing strongly. Rapid growth in \nimports of raw materials and capital machinery also point to a better \nindustrial performance. An improvement in the power supply and a \nrise in business confidence, too, are likely to boost activity. In FY2012, \nindustry is expected to grow strongly at 7.8%, reflecting a rise in external \ndemand and higher domestic capacity. \n\nIn FY2011, services growth is forecast to rise slightly to 6.7% from \n\n6.4%, mainly on the strength of industrial and trade and transport \nactivity, as the pulse of trade quickens. Sector growth will rise further to \n7.2% in FY2012, reflecting industrial and agricultural strengthening.\n\nThe rise in year-on-year inflation is pushing up the 12-month average. \n\nAlthough the central bank\u2019s January 2011 monetary policy statement \nforecast 7.0% inflation for FY2011, it may well come in at 8.0%, rising \n\nIndex\n9,000\n\n6,000\n\n3,000\n\n0\n\n%\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\nSource: Bangladesh Bank. 2011.

The central bank instructed \ncommercial banks to rein in credit growth and set a deadline for cutting \nthe credit-to-deposit ratio. The marked rise in global commodity prices, \nthe likely further depreciation in the taka, a power tariff increase in \nFebruary 2011, and expected hikes in fuel and compressed natural gas \nprices are all seen exerting upward supply-side pressures. Monetary \npolicies are unlikely to fully counter them. \n\nThe slower growth in remittance inflows that began around February \n2010\tintensified\tin\tFY2011.\tOverseas\tworkers\tremitted\t$7.5\tbillion\tduring\t\nthe first 8 months of FY2011, for growth of only 2.5%\u2014a startling drop \nfrom a 19.0% gain in the year-earlier period. The decline is a concern as \nhealthy remittance growth helps to underpin consumer spending and is a \nkey source of domestic demand. Job placements for Bangladeshi workers, \nwho are mostly low-skilled, declined by 10.9% in the first 8 months of \nFY2011 (Figure 3.15.10), continuing the declines of the previous 2 years. \nRemittances are likely to grow at very modest rates of 3.0% in FY2011 and \n4.0% in FY2012. The latest developments in the Middle East could also \naffect remittances.\n\nThe continued robust performance in export earnings that started \n\nin March 2010 raised the prospect of exceeding the FY2011 annual \nexport\ttarget\tof\t$18.5\tbillion.\tIn\tthe\tfirst\t8\tmonths\tof\tFY2011,\trapid\t\ngrowth in readymade garment exports (woven by 38.0% and knitwear \nby 43.9%), representing over three-fourths of total exports, was partly \ndue to importing countries replenishing their inventories, though it \nalso reflected a sharp rise in wages in some other garment-exporting \ncountries. Although industry\u2019s agreement to raise monthly wages\u2014to \nabout\t$43\u2013$133\tfor\tgarment\tworkers\u2014has\tby\tand\tlarge\tbeen\tpushed\t\nthrough following frequent worker unrest over the past couple of years, it \nhardly dented wage differentials with competitors. \n\nExports of other items such as frozen foods and jute also grew \nstrongly. Very high export growth in the first part of FY2011 is expected \nto moderate as inventory rebuilding comes to an end, pointing to a 21.0% \nexpansion in exports for all FY2011. In FY2012, exports are projected to \ngrow by 22.0%.\n\nExports to the European Union will benefit from relaxed rules of \n\norigin (introduced 1 January 2011) under the Generalized System of \nPreferences. Bangladesh readymade garments are also diversifying their \nexport destinations to countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nSouth Africa, and Turkey. \n\nIn tandem with the rise in exports \u2014a large part of which was based \non imported raw materials\u2014import payments rose by 40.7% in the first \n7 months of FY2011. Imports of food items, industrial raw materials, \nand capital machinery grew rapidly. Growth in overall imports is set to \nmoderate over the rest of the fiscal year as imports of raw materials for \nthe readymade garment industries slow. The import bill for fuel will rise, \nhowever, reflecting volume and price increases. Imports are forecast to \ngrow by 23.0% in FY2011 and 24.0% in FY2012. \n\nThe external current account is seen showing a smaller surplus of \n0.2% of GDP in FY2011, and then turning into a deficit of 0.3% of GDP in \nFY2012 (Figure 3.15.11), reflecting slow remittance growth and a widening \ntrade gap. \n\n3.15.9  Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n5-year moving average\n\nInflation\n\n09\n\n10\n\n08\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n12\n11\nForecast\nSources: Bangladesh Bank. 2011.

The \nprogram is expected to catalyze financing and support policy adjustments \nand reforms conducive to boosting growth, while strengthening the \nexternal position (Box 3.15.1). \n\n3.15.1  The Extended Credit Facility\n\nUnder a proposed program for a SDR640 million (about \n$1 billion) loan from the Extended Credit Facility of the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the government plans to \nundertake major reforms to put Bangladesh on a higher \ngrowth trajectory. \n\nFor raising tax revenue by around 3 percentage points as \na share of GDP, it is expected to deepen tax administration \nreforms, including enacting value-added and income-tax \nlaws. It aims to improve public financial management and \noperationalize the public\u2013private partnership program for \nboosting public and private investment. \n\nReforms under the program are expected to improve \n\nmonetary and foreign exchange operations, strengthen \nthe finance sector and its oversight (focusing on financial \n\nconditions of state-owned commercial banks and the \ncompliance by all banks with new capital-adequacy \nrequirements), and promote the country\u2019s integration into \nthe regional and global economy through a more open \ntrade and investment regime. \n\nFor containing inflation pressure, the central bank is \nseen tightening monetary policy, aided by greater interest- \nand exchange-rate flexibility. It is also likely to work \nclosely with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nensure appropriate actions by commercial banks and their \nsubsidiaries to limit risks from stock market volatility. \nThe operating losses of the larger power and energy \nutilities are expected to be brought on the government \nbudget.\n\nTax collection grew robustly by 28.4% during the first 7 months of \nFY2011 over the year-earlier period\u2014direct taxes and domestic indirect \ntaxes contributed most to the rise in revenue, although import-based \nindirect taxes also improved well. The expansion in domestic economic \nactivity and better tax compliance, aided by reforms, are the main factors. \n\nThe annual development program\u2019s utilization rate in the first \n\n8 months of FY2011 did not improve relative to the previous year, and its \nannual allocation is unlikely to be fully spent, despite recent government \nmeasures such as forming a task force to beef up implementation and \nprogress monitoring. \n\nNor have any of the sizable resources earmarked for the Bangladesh \n\nInfrastructure Finance Fund, set up in the FY2011 budget to finance \nprojects under the public\u2013private partnership mechanism, been drawn \non. Although budgetary allocations for food, fuel, fertilizer, and \nother agricultural inputs will be larger than in FY2010, the chronic \nunderspending of investment allocations is expected to keep the fiscal \ndeficit within its budgeted level of 5.0% of GDP (Figure 3.15.12). \n\nThe 11.0% increase in bulk power tariffs in February 2011 will help \nto cut Bangladesh Power Development Board\u2019s losses. The 5.0% hike in \nretail tariffs will improve the financial performance of power distribution \ncompanies. \n\nThe Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) is nursing sizable losses \n\nas the government made no adjustment in domestic administered prices \nfor fuels, even though global oil prices climbed sharply.

A slackening of \nthe global recovery would likely slow export growth and heavily curtail \nremittances. Higher than projected domestic inflation could affect \nmacroeconomic stability and discourage investment. Finally, inability \nto bring the planned short-term addition to power supply, such as the \ncommissioning of small, private diesel and fuel-oil generators, and \nslippage in addressing gas shortages would also slow growth, mainly \nthrough their impact on industry. \n\nDevelopment challenges\nTwo critical challenges to exploit Bangladesh\u2019s growth potential are to \nupgrade infrastructure and to ensure a large, skilled workforce. \n\nA major step in upgrading infrastructure was taken recently: three \nindependent power producer contracts were awarded for generation. Once \ncompleted, they will add over 1 gigawatt to the grid, helping to relieve \na bottleneck for industrial and employment expansion. Efforts are still \nneeded to take advantage of the public\u2013private partnership mechanism \nto create projects in infrastructure and to make the Bangladesh \nInfrastructure Finance Fund operational. \n\nBangladesh could reap a rich demographic dividend by transforming \n\nits large young population into a productive human resource through \nbetter education and health care. A balanced combination of public and \nprivate sector initiatives in delivering these services is needed. \n\nAnother issue is ensuring the availability of land for public and \nprivate sector projects. The rapidly declining land available per capita, \nexacerbated by poorly maintained land records, is making it increasingly \ndifficult to buy land for infrastructure or industrial and commercial use. \nA linked emerging challenge is urban congestion, in Dhaka and \nChittagong especially, but also in other urban areas. Rapid urbanization \nis stretching too thin cities\u2019 capacity to provide urban services. For \neasing traffic gridlock in cities, one option is to develop mass rapid \ntransit systems and satellite townships near the major urban areas. Rural \nand semi-urban areas need to be made more livable with expanded \nopportunities for better livelihoods. \n\n\fBhutan\n\nThe  economy,  which  has  vast  hydropower  potential,  is  driven  by  the  cycle  of  hydropower  building  and \noutput.  Two  hydropower  stations  are  being  built  and  two  other  projects  started  preconstruction  work  in \nMay  2010,  ensuring  strong  growth  for  the  medium  term.  The  main  challenges  for  the  government  are  to \ntry  and  diversify  the  economy  and  create  job  opportunities.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth is estimated to have accelerated to 7.0% in FY2010 (ended 30 June \n2010) from 5.7% in FY2009 (Figure 3.16.1). Construction revived with \nwork on the Punatsangchhu I (1,200 megawatts [MW]) and Dagachhu \n(114 MW) hydropower stations. Services, accounting for nearly two-fifths \nof GDP, contributed the bulk of the GDP gain, mainly construction \nrelated. Agriculture\u2019s growth was solid. Despite generating only about 16% \nof GDP, it engages over 65% of the labor force. \n\nThe electricity and water sector\u2014nearly a quarter of GDP\u2014did not \ncontribute to the expansion, as no additional generation capacity has been \nadded since Tala hydropower station came online in FY2007. Tourism \nwas also a drag on growth due to the global downturn: visitor arrivals \ndropped by 9.3% and foreign exchange earnings by 12.4%. \n\nAs Bhutan is linked with India through trade (93.5% of exports and \n\n77.7% of imports) and a currency peg, rising consumer prices in India \ntend to spill over. Year-on-year inflation rose to 6.1% in the fourth quarter \nof FY2010 from 3.0% a year earlier (Figure 3.16.2). \n\nWith a pickup in economic activity, growth in broad money \n\naccelerated to 30.1% from 24.6%, as domestic assets expanded. Domestic \ncredit, primarily to the private sector, grew by 38.6% in FY2010 from \n31.1% in the previous year, reflecting surging personal loans and credit \nto manufacturing. The sectorwide distribution of credit remained \nmostly to housing (about one-quarter of the loan portfolio), followed by \nmanufacturing, personal loans, and services (including tourism). \n\nCredit quality improved as nonperforming loans as a share of the total \n\nnarrowed to 10.1% in June 2010 from 18.3% the previous year, reflecting \na fall in such loans in manufacturing, where several export-oriented \nfirms saw an upswing in sales. Banks are well capitalized with a capital-\nadequacy ratio of 17.1% at end-FY2010. \n\nThe budget deficit in FY2010 is estimated at around 6% of GDP, \n\nreflecting revisions that sharply raised capital expenditure despite a fall in \nnontax revenue (Figure 3.16.3). These adjustments stemmed from additional \nconstruction spending, including a monastery and other public buildings. \nNontax revenue declined because of a 1-year gap in dividend receipts. \n(Druk Holding and Investments was set up to own all major state-owned \n\nThis chapter was written by Tadateru Hayashi of the South Asia Department, ADB, \nManila.\n\n3.16.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\nConstruction\nServices\n\nAgriculture\nElectricity\nOther industries\n\nPercentage points\n\n12.6\n\n10.8\n\n7.8\n\n5.7\n\n7.0\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: Royal Monetary Authority. 2011.

The final \nfigure of the fiscal deficit in FY2010, may, however, be substantially lower \ndue to underimplementation of capital investment projects. The fiscal deficit \nin FY2011 is estimated at 4.4% of GDP. A civil service wage hike effective \nJanuary 2011 will increase current spending in FY2011 and FY2012. \n\nThe government has announced tax incentives to stimulate private \n\ninvestment. Foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in FY2010 with \nan\testimated\tinvestment\tof\tNu1.1\tbillion\t(equivalent\tto\t$23.6\tmillion)\t\nincluded an IT park and an agro-industry project. \n\nThe trade deficit is estimated to have worsened to 21.5% of GDP \nin FY2010 from 7.5%, as growth in merchandise imports accelerated \nmarkedly (Figure 3.16.4). Imports climbed by 39.0%, mainly because of \nheavy needs for machinery, transport vehicles, and base metals for the \nhydropower projects and housing. \n\nExports rose by only 5.5% as sales of hydropower to India (about \n\ntwo-fifths of total exports) were pretty flat as capacity production has been \nreached. A jump in budgetary grants, mainly from India, held the current \naccount deficit to 13.5% of GDP in FY2010 from 1.6% the previous year. \n\nThe capital and financial account surplus\u2014about half in capital grants \nand half in borrowing and FDI\u2014nearly offset the current account deficit. \nThe\toverall\tbalance\tof\tpayments\twas\tin\tsurplus\tby\t$94\tmillion,\tgiving\tan\t\nunusually large positive errors and omissions item.

Hydropower construction will \ntherefore fuel GDP growth for the next 5 years, even as additional power \nproduction capacity and exports come online. Indeed, the government \nplans by 2020 to see new power stations increase generation capacity to \n10,000 MW, about seven times the present level. Accordingly, GDP is \nestimated to grow by 7.5% in FY2011 and 8.0% in FY2012.\n\nHigh inflation in India, especially of food, is a concern. Projected higher \n\nglobal commodity price hikes will indirectly affect Bhutan, where inflation \nis expected to reach 8.0% in FY2011 and moderate to 7.5% in FY2012.\n\nThe current account deficit will deteriorate, mainly owing to imports \n\nof construction materials for power stations, as well as higher import \nprices of fuel. Export growth will likely be limited in the next couple \nof years. Expansion will need to come mainly from manufactured and \ncommodity exports, as no additional power generation capacity will come \nonline. \n\nAlthough tourism revenue will grow, soaring imports are expected \nto push the current deficit out to around 20% of GDP in both years. As \nwith past projects, capital inflows from India to finance power plant \nconstruction, combined with development assistance, FDI, and some \nother borrowing, will likely suffice to finance the current account deficit.\n\n3.16.3  Fiscal indicators\n\nTotal revenue (including grants)\nOverall balance\nCapital expenditure\nCurrent expenditure\n\n% of GDP\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSource: Royal Monetary Authority. 2011.

The government\u2019s decision \nto undertake the Thimphu Technology \nPark and Education City projects \nare attempts to foster economic \ndiversification by moving toward a \nknowledge-driven economy.\n\nGenerating jobs is hard, as \nhydropower has small backward \nlinkages and is capital intensive. \nSpeeding up private sector \ndevelopment is therefore crucial to \nexpand job opportunities and diversify \nthe economy. \n\nThe government has announced \nFiscal Incentives 2010\u2014a broad array \nof general and sector-specific tax \nincentives\u2014as well as Foreign Direct \nInvestment Policy 2010, to promote \nprivate sector investment.\n\n\fIndia\n\nThe  Indian  economy  experienced  high  and  broad-based  growth  over  the  past  fiscal  year.  Inflation  has \nbeen  the  main  challenge  for  policy  makers,  with  the  observed  pattern  of  price  increases  highlighting \nthe  need  to  tackle  decisively  weaknesses  along  the  domestic  agricultural  supply  chain.  Weaker  global \ntrade  growth  and  a  necessary  further  tightening  of  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  will  slow  economic \ngrowth  marginally  in  the  new  fiscal  year.  However,  progress  on  fiscal  consolidation  and  success  in \neasing  supply-side  constraints  will  pay  off  the  following  year.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy grew by 8.6% in FY2010 (ending March 2011) according to \nthe government\u2019s advance estimates. Growth has been broad-based and \ndriven by a solid recovery in agriculture and continued good performance \nof industry and services (Figure 3.17.1).\n\nHelped by a good monsoon that boosted the kharif (summer) crop, \nagriculture is estimated to grow by 5.4% in FY2010, after 0.4% in FY2009, \nwhen a deep and widespread drought (and subsequent flooding) held \nback farming. Foodgrain production, estimated at 232 million tonnes in \nFY2010, is 6.4% higher than FY2009\u2019s output (though still lower than the \nrecord 234 million tonnes in FY2008).\n\nWhile industry is estimated to record healthy growth of 8.1% in \nFY2010, the second half saw a moderation of growth. In particular, after \ngrowth of 10.1% in the first half, industrial output growth slowed to \nsingle-digits in the second. \n\nThe main contributors to strong growth in the first half of FY2010 \nwere consumer durables and capital goods. Important infrastructure \nsectors, such as crude oil, petroleum refining, electricity, and steel, also \nperformed well. Apart from the base effect, the deceleration in the second \nhalf has been driven by a slowdown in capital goods production owing \nto a slowdown in investment. While it is difficult to pin down the exact \ncause of the investment slowdown, delays in obtaining environmental \nclearances, difficulties with land acquisition, and the lack of progress on \nsome expected policy reforms may have played a role.\n\nServices are estimated to grow by 9.6% in FY2010, a little lower than \n\nthe 10.1% growth registered in FY2009. Key drivers included the trade; \nhotels; transport and communications; and finance, insurance, real estate, \nand business subsectors. Given the dominance of services, their healthy \nperformance is crucial for high overall growth. This sector accounted for \n64% of overall GDP growth in FY2010, down from 71% in FY2009.\n\nThe drivers of growth from the expenditure side have also been \nbroad-based (Figure 3.17.2), with healthy contributions from private \n\nThis chapter was written by Rana Hasan of the India Resident Mission, ADB, New Delhi.\n\n3.17.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\n9.6\n\n9.3\n\n8.0\n\n8.6\n\n6.8\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation. http://www.mospi.nic.in (accessed \n8 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.17.2  Growth of GDP components\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nGross fixed capital formation\nExports\nImports\n\nServices\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n%\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSources: Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation. http://www.mospi.nic.in (accessed \n8 March 2011); ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f156    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nconsumption, investment, and exports. While total consumption growth \nslowed from 8.7% in FY2009 to 7.3% in FY2010, this stemmed from a \nconcurrent sharp decline in growth of government consumption from \n16.4% to 2.6%; growth in private consumption\u2014which accounts for more \nthan four-fifths of total consumption\u2014rose from 7.3% to 8.2%. \n\nSimilarly, although growth in gross capital formation slowed from \n13.8% to 8.8% over the same period, fixed capital formation edged up from \n7.3% to 8.4%. Nevertheless, the full figure for FY2010 masks a slowdown \nin the second half when fixed capital formation growth dropped from \ndouble digits in the first half to 6% in the third quarter. In contrast, \nexports picked up significantly in the second half, leading net exports to \ncontribute positively to growth for the first time in many years. \n\nWith the onset of global recovery, investment registered a marked \nincrease from 34.5% of GDP in FY2008 to 36.5% in FY2009, driven by \na rise in corporate sector investment of 1.7 percentage points of GDP. \nThe investment rate is estimated by the Economic Advisory Council of \nthe Prime Minister to have increased to 37%. The saving rate recovered \nsomewhat in FY2009 to 33.7% of GDP and appears to have risen \nmarginally to 34% in FY 2010. Both saving and investment remain, \nhowever, below their precrisis highs (Figure 3.17.3). \n\nInflation has been a major concern in FY2010. While monthly year-\non-year rates moderated from the double-digits reached in mid-2010, they \nare estimated to have been 9.2% for the fiscal year. Food inflation has \nbeen an important driver, accounting for between a quarter and a third of \nmonthly wholesale price inflation in FY2010. \n\nMuch of the initial surge in food inflation in FY2010 (Figure 3.17.4) \ncame from the weak FY2009 monsoon\u2019s impact on output and prices of \ncereals, pulses, and sugar. It has later been driven by subcontinent-specific \nweather shocks and demand\u2013supply mismatches, as rising incomes and \nshifting dietary patterns increased demand for vegetables, fruits, and high-\nprotein items. These factors have highlighted the need for dramatically \nimproving production and distribution systems in agriculture. \n\nFinally, as the product-based breakdown of the figure shows, price \n\nincreases in manufactured products have been important and have \ncontributed to worries that inflation expectations are becoming entrenched.\nTackling the problem of high inflation has turned out to be complex. \n\nIn response to rising inflation and a recovering economy, the Reserve \nBank of India (RBI) reversed its accommodative policy stance in March \n2010. The RBI has raised the repo rate (the rate at which banks borrow \nfrom it) eight times by 200 basis points in FY2010, which now stands at \n6.75%; it has also raised the reverse repo rate (the rate at which it borrows \nmoney from banks) over the same period, and that now stands at 5.75% \n(Figure 3.17.5). The central bank also raised the cash-reserve ratio from \n5.5% to 6.0% in April 2010.\n\nThe RBI recognizes that monetary policy may not be the most \n\neffective instrument to deal with supply-side pressures on inflation. But its \nconcern is that the repeated supply shocks that have affected the economy, \nalong with recent petroleum price increases, have generated expectations \nof high inflation and may contribute to future inflation. The increase in \nkey policy rates has been partly carried out to contain such expectations.\n\nLiquidity tightened considerably owing to an increase in credit growth \n\n3.17.3  Saving and investment ratio\n\nInvestment\n\nSaving\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\nSaving\nInvestment\n\n \n\n02\n\n2000\n\n08\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n04\n\n06\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10\n\n3.17.4  Contributions to inflation\n\nAll commodities\n\nManufactured products\nFuel and power\nMinerals\nNonfood articles\nFood articles\n\nPercentage points\n12\n\n%\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\nJan\n2009\n\nApr Jul Oct Jan\n10\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nFeb\n11\n\nSource: Ministry of Industry and Commerce. http://\neaindustry.nic.in (accessed 17 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.17.5  Monetary policy indicators\n\nRepo rate\nReverse repo rate\nCash-reserve ratio\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nMar\n11\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 18 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n%\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia    157\n\nand a fall in the deposit growth rate.

These flows helped the stock market to put on \n30% in May\u2013October 2010, though it has since declined by about 12.7% \n(Figure 3.17.8). In contrast, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows slowed \nnotably,\tfrom\t$35.6\tbillion\tin\tFY2009\tto\t$27.6\tbillion\tin\tFY2010.\tThe\t\ndeceleration can only partly be explained by a still weak global recovery. \nDifficulties in land acquisition and environmental issues and slow \nprogress of liberalization of certain sectors such as retail and insurance \nare likely also to have played a role.\n\nThe excess of capital flows over the current account deficit resulted \nin\taccretion\tto\tforeign\texchange\treserves,\twhich\trose\tby\t$17.8\tbillion\tto\t\nexceed\t$300\tbillion\tin\tMarch\t2011\t(Figure\t3.17.9).\tA\tpart\tof\tthis\trise\twas\t\ndue to valuation change as some of the major currencies appreciated \nagainst the US dollar during the year.\n\nThe rupee has remained quite stable in FY2010. It rose marginally \nagainst the US dollar. Inflation higher than in trading partners has led to a \nmodest rise in the real effective exchange rate (Figure 3.17.10). \n\nBetter than expected revenue from the sale of third-generation \nspectrum for high-speed telephony and broadband services, as well \nas robust GDP growth, helped to reduce the central government\u2019s \nfiscal deficit from 6.4% of GDP in FY2009 to 5.1% in FY2010, thereby \nrestricting the combined deficit of the center and states to around \n8.1% (Figure 3.17.11). The ratio of central government gross tax revenue \n(including states\u2019 share) to GDP increased to 10% in FY2010, improving \nfrom 9.5% in FY2009, but it remains much lower than the 11.9% achieved \nin FY2007. \n\nDespite India\u2019s strong resilience to the crisis and its ability to post robust \ngrowth rates, it has made little progress in some reforms.

Also, some major industrial projects faced difficulties in getting \nthe required clearances from the environment ministry. \n\nFinally and critically, the move toward a unified goods and services \n\ntax (GST), which is an important step for fiscal consolidation, slowed, \nwith the center and states gridlocked in negotiations. The states have been \nconcerned about losing their fiscal autonomy, which would follow from \na loss of power to change tax rates. They also have anxieties that a GST \nwould raise their dependence on central government transfers. The center \nand states are also discussing GST rates, as some states view the proposed \nrevenue-neutral rates as too low. Moreover, they disagree over the taxes to \nbe subsumed under the GST system.\n\nRecent months have, however, seen positive steps on some of these \n\nissues. A renewed effort is under way to allow greater FDI in retail \nand insurance in a phased manner. The environment ministry has \nallowed through (with conditions) some of the projects initially denied \nenvironmental clearance but has asked promoters for some of the others \nto apply afresh. \n\nOn the fiscal front, there is an attempt to move toward direct cash \ntransfers for subsidized fertilizer, liquefied petroleum gas, and kerosene, \nwhich are expected to contain the waste and misdirection of these \ncommodities. Last, the government on 21 March introduced to Parliament \na constitution amendment bill to facilitate implementation of the GST.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe following forecasts for FY2011 and FY2012 make several assumptions, \nin addition to those given in the baseline table 1.1.1 in part 1: the monsoons \nin both 2011 and 2012 will be normal; monetary tightening will continue \nin FY2011; and the government will broadly adhere to the rigorous fiscal \nconsolidation road map suggested by the 13th Finance Commission.\nWhile domestic pressures on inflation are expected to ease on \n\naccount of normal monsoons and payoffs from the government\u2019s efforts at \nimproving the agricultural supply chain, elevated international oil prices \nwill exert upward pressure on prices. On balance, average inflation for \nFY2011 and FY2012 is expected to decline to 7.8% and 6.5%, respectively \n(Figure 3.17.12) on account of a high-base effect and further tightening of \nmonetary policy by the RBI to anchor expectations.\n\nAlong with higher input prices due to rising oil prices, monetary \ntightening will tend to further damp private investment, which was \nslowing toward the end of FY2010. The government\u2019s efforts at fiscal \nconsolidation will, however, help to provide some relief. Especially \nif consolidation proceeds largely as spelled out in the government\u2019s \nbudget for FY2011\u2014spending on subsidies is kept in check and planned \ninfrastructure investment is not compromised\u2014private investment may \nexperience some \u201ccrowding in,\u201d even as the government reins in its \noverall spending. \n\nOf course, elevated oil prices suggest that the government may not be \nable to hit its target for reducing subsidies by 12.5% in FY2011. Even with \nthe move in 2010 to deregulate gasoline (petrol) prices, other fuel prices \nand natural gas remain under administrative control and the government \n\n3.17.12  Annual inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nAnnual inflation\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia    159\n\nis unlikely to raise their prices one-on-one with market conditions. \nNevertheless, some reduction in subsidies should be possible and the \ngovernment\u2019s intended move toward direct cash transfers of fuel-related \nsubsidies could have far-reaching consequences in the medium term.\n\nBased on the assumption of normal rainfall and with higher base, \nagriculture is expected to expand by 3%\u20134% in FY2011 and FY2012. In \naddition, proposed increases in public investment in the sector should \nprovide it with a boost. But industry and services will remain the key \ndrivers of growth. \n\nAt the same time, some large greenfield manufacturing projects have \n\nfaced hurdles in terms of acquiring land and obtaining environmental \nclearance. Although these cases involve complex trade-offs between \ndevelopment, traditional livelihoods, and the environment, policy and \nregulatory clarity on these issues is crucial. \n\nYet the government\u2019s intention of streamlining the regulatory burden \n\non Indian firms, and the expectation that current restrictions on FDI \nin multi-brand retail will be relaxed, augur well for both industry and \nservices, especially by FY2012.\n\nSustaining growth also depends on external demand, which is \nassumed to moderate marginally following a rise in global economic \nrisks. A survey by the HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for \nboth manufacturing and services released in March 2011 shows some \nimprovement, largely due to increase in orders and expansion in new \nbusiness activity (Figure 3.17.13). \n\nBut there are strong downside risks, notably inflation pressure \nfrom rising oil prices. In view of the Asian Development Outlook 2011\u2019s \nassumptions for oil prices, as well as monetary and fiscal tightening, GDP \ngrowth is expected be a little lower in FY2011 than in FY2010 at 8.2%. \nIt should rise to 8.8% in FY2012 as reform efforts and regulatory clarity \nboost investment and economic activity more generally.\n\nThe current account deficit is very likely to widen over the \nnext 2 years\u2014fairly sharply to 3.5% of GDP in FY2011\u2014driven by a \ndeteriorating trade deficit and moderate growth in invisibles. While \nforeign capital inflows have covered this deficit relatively comfortably in \nrecent years, trends in FY2010 flag a cause for concern. \n\nAs is well known, international flows of portfolio capital can \nexhibit considerable volatility and thus the slowdown in inflows of \nFDI to India\u2014in contrast to the pickup observed in other emerging \neconomies\u2014is troubling. The recent budget has relaxed norms for \nforeign institutional investors in order to attract more foreign capital, \nespecially in infrastructure. But these also need to be backed by an \nimprovement in the regulatory environment in which firms\u2014domestic \nand foreign\u2014operate.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nSustaining high growth and ensuring that it is inclusive remains India\u2019s \nforemost development challenge. Even with the tremendous dynamism \nexhibited by services\u2014a sector that has contributed almost two-thirds of \nGDP growth in recent years and now accounts for 55% of GDP and 25% \nof total employment\u2014it is difficult to see how India will be able to sustain \n\n3.17.13  HSBC India manufacturing \npurchasing managers index\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nFeb\n11\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 21 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nHSBC India manufacturing  \npurchasing managers index\n\nIndex\n65\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n3.17.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n8.2\n\n7.8\n\n-3.5\n\n8.8\n\n6.5\n\n-3.3\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\f160    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\ninclusive growth without boosting agricultural productivity and further \nstrengthening manufacturing. The latter is crucial for employing a young \nand growing workforce\u2014including those released from farm work\u2014with \nproductive and well-paying jobs. \n\nAgriculture has suffered a secular decline in public investment \nsince the mid-1990s, as well as a steady increase in input subsidies such \nas those for power and fertilizer. The country is behind comparable \ncountries in investing in new technology, research and development, and \ninfrastructure. For example, it invests only 0.5 % of its agricultural GDP \nin agricultural research, compared with 0.7 % in developing countries as a \nwhole and as much as 2\u20133 % in developed countries.\n\nA silver lining to the high food inflation over the past year is the \nurgency it has generated among policy makers to engineer a second green \nrevolution in India (Box 3.17.1). \n\nThe task of transforming manufacturing also deserves the attention \n\nof policy makers. A defining feature of India\u2019s manufacturing is the \noverwhelming importance of small firms and the informal sector \nin jobs (also known as the unorganized sector). Thus 84% of India\u2019s \nmanufacturing employment is estimated to be in firms with fewer \nthan 50 workers (Figure 3.17.14), whereas the corresponding shares are \n25%\u201347% for economies such as the PRC; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; \nTaipei,China; and Thailand. At small scales of operation, firms can often \nget caught in a vicious circle of reliance on traditional, low-productivity \ntechnologies with limited earnings and few growth prospects.\n\nAt the same time, larger enterprises\u2014those operating in the formal \n\n(or organized) sector where both productivity and wages tend to be \nrelatively high\u2014have often been stymied by infrastructure and regulatory \nbottlenecks from expanding. As a result, although employment in \nthe subsector grew robustly in 2004\u20132008, it still stood at only some \n11 million (around 2.5% of the labor force). \n\nFrom a policy perspective, there are two broad challenges for \ntransforming manufacturing. For the formal subsector, much policy \nreform has already taken place\u2014such as industrial delicensing in the \n1990s and large-scale cutbacks in small-scale sector reservations in the \nearly to mid-2000s. \n\nWhat remains to be tackled are infrastructure bottlenecks, features \nof India\u2019s labor regulation that impinge on the adjustment of labor use \nwithin and across plants and sectors, and difficulties in the acquisition \nof land and environmental clearances for industrial activity. The \ngovernment\u2019s recent announcement on a manufacturing policy that will \ntackle various regulatory issues is an opportunity to make headway on \ndifficult institutional and politically sensitive issues.\n\nFor the informal subsector, and small and medium-sized enterprises \nin the formal sector, imperfections in credit markets and lack of awareness \nand access to markets and technologies add to the infrastructure-related \ndifficulties that these firms face. While the government has in place a \nvariety of interventions for assisting such firms in these areas, the key \nchallenge lies in effectively delivering program services to target enterprises. \nTo make sure that public financing is not wasted, clear benchmarks \nfor success and failure must be adopted, and rigorous monitoring and \nevaluation systems must be built into the government\u2019s programs.\n\n3.17.1  Transforming agriculture\n\nThe government has announced \nhigher funding for a slew of programs \naimed at dealing with production and \ndistribution bottlenecks for fruits, \nvegetables, milk, meat, poultry, and \nfish\u2014items that have been particularly \nsusceptible to large price increases. \n\nEfforts for developing \u201cmega food \nparks\u201d (for reducing wastage of fruit \nand vegetables for lack of storage \nfacilities) and augmenting storage \ncapacity and cold chains through \npublic\u2013private approaches are also \nbeing promoted. The government will \nrecognize cold chains and postharvest \nstorage facilities as an infrastructure \nsubsector in its own right, making it \neligible for any special benefits that \napply. \n\nCareful monitoring and evaluation \n\nof these efforts is needed to ensure \nthat they have the intended effects. \nAt the same time, state governments \nmust review the operation of \nthe Agricultural Produce Market \nCommittee Act. Revamping this \nact would allow, for example, \nagro-processors, private markets, \ncorporations, and exporters to directly \ndeal with farmers and ease restrictions \nthat apply to contract farming and \nthe movement of agricultural produce \nfrom one location to another. \n\n3.17.14  Share of manufacturing employment\n\nMicro and small\n\nMedium\n\nLarge\n\nPeople's Rep. of China\n\n24.8\n\n23.3\n\nMalaysia\n\n27.5\n\n19.7\n\n51.8\n\n52.8\n\nTaipei,China\n\nThailand\n\n38.9\n\n45.7\n\n21.3\n\n39.8\n\n12.7\n\n41.6\n\nRep. of Korea\n\n46.5\n\n23.9\n\n29.6\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nIndia\n\n64.7\n\n69.6\n\n6.3\n\n29.0\n\n7.5\n\n22.8\n\n84.0\n\n5.5\n\n10.5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n%\n\nNotes: Micro and small: 1\u201349 in all countries except Thailand \n(1\u201350 workers); Medium: 50\u2013199 in all countries except \nThailand (51\u2013200 workers); Large: 200 or more workers in all \ncountries except Thailand (more than 200 workers) \nSource: Rana Hasan and Karl Robert Jandoc. 2010.

The  passage  of  new  tax  bills  in \n2010, although it took longer than scheduled, will generate revenue gains in the near term. Nevertheless, \nthe  government  will  need  to  formulate  a  strong  medium-term  adjustment  strategy  in  order  to  get  its \neconomic  program  supported  by  international  financial  institutions. \n\nEconomic performance\nThe government struggled to implement fiscal reforms in 2010. Since \nthe president\u2019s party is in the minority in the Majlis, it faced difficulties \nin  pushing reforms through Parliament. The agenda included a Tourist \nGeneral Service Tax (T-GST) and Business Profit Tax (BPT). As the \npolitical situation worsened from midyear\u2014the cabinet resigned en \nmasse\u2014progress in fiscal reforms has slowed, especially in the area of \nexpenditure reduction. \n\nThe T-GST was, however, passed in August, becoming effective in \nJanuary this year; the BPT was passed in December and takes effect in \nJuly this year. The fiscal gap would have been larger had it not been for \na temporary cut in civil servants\u2019 wages. An improvement in revenue on \nthe back of a rebound in tourist arrivals also helped to narrow the budget \ndeficit for the year.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, GDP growth recovered to 4.8% in 2010 after \n\ncontracting by 2.3% in 2009 (Figure 3.18.1). A key driver was a better \nthan expected upswing in tourism, which accounts for almost a third of \nGDP. Tourist arrivals registered a rebound of 20.7% in 2010. An influx \nof visitors from the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, \nIndia, and other Asian countries outpaced a slower renaissance in \nEuropean arrivals, a market usually accounting for around two-thirds of \ntotal visitors (Figure 3.18.2).

Broad money \nincreased by 16.5%. The interest rate on T-bills declined in the first half of \n2010, but partly came back during the second (Figure 3.18.4).\n\nThe fiscal deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 16.4% of GDP in \n2010 from 30.9% in 2009 (Figure 3.18.5). Although total revenue (excluding \ngrants) is expected to have picked up by 14.6%, reflecting a rebound in \ntourism-related earnings and profits received from the airport concession, \nit was 11% below the original projection after the T-GST and BPT did \nnot materialize in time to boost 2010 revenue as planned. Expenditure \ndropped by 10.2% as the government put through temporary fiscal \nausterity measures, such as wage cuts for public servants.\n\nThe\tRf12.37\tbillion\t($962.6\tmillion)\tbudget\tfor\t2011,\tpassed\tin\t\n\nDecember 2010, sets only a slight reduction in the deficit to 15.3% of the \nGDP. Upfront payments by resort islands for lease extensions, from 25 \nto 50 years, as well as new tax measures, will increase fiscal revenue. But \nthere is so far no clear road map for long-term expenditure saving. \n\nOn the external front, the current account deficit is estimated to have \nslightly narrowed to 31.3% of GDP in 2010 from 31.8% in 2009, as the gain \nin tourism receipts was outweighed by higher imports (Figure 3.18.6). \nWhile reserves declined through most of the year they spiked in \nNovember,\ton\ta\t$74\tmillion\tupfront\tpayment\tby\tthe\tairport\tconcession.\t\nThis transaction helped to push the overall balance of payments into \nsurplus, lifting gross international reserves by about one-third to \n$349.9\tmillion\tin\t2010,\tyielding\t3.3\tmonths\tof\timport\tcover.\tThe\tMaldives\t\nMonetary Authority continued its currency peg to US dollar at a rate of \nRf12.8, though foreign exchange shortages and a parallel market premium \npersisted during the year.\n\nEconomic prospects\nTourism is likely to lead economic growth. Tourist arrivals from Europe \nshould continue recovering, and the number of Asian tourists will \ncontinue growing, as their disposable incomes improve. \n\nThe 2011 budget plans about a 25% increase in total expenditure, and \n\nthe medium-term fiscal framework projects the same level of expenditure \nin 2012, a marked turnaround from the near 12% decline a year earlier. \nAt nearly three-fifths of GDP if fully carried out, these plans represent \na marked expansion in domestic demand. On the basis that planned \nexpenditure is scaled down and tourism makes further gains, GDP is \nexpected to grow by 5.0% in each of the next 2 years.  \n\nOn the assumption that the global oil and food prices rise \nsubstantially in 2011 and moderate in 2012, and budget expenditure \npressures on domestic inflation. It is projected that inflation will rise to \n8.0% or more in 2011, and moderate to 7.0% in 2012.\n\nSteady economic growth, primarily due to the tourism rebound, and \nhigher international commodity prices will buttress merchandise import \ngrowth. Assuming that the currency peg to the US dollar continues, \ngrowth in imports will continue to outpace tourism receipts, the current \naccount deficit is expected to widen to 35% of GDP in 2011 and will \nremain at this level in 2012.\n\n3.18.3  Contributions to inflation\n\nTotal\nFood\nHousing, water, power, and fuel\n\nTransport\nOthers\n\nPercentage points\n10\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJul Oct Jan\n10\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct Dec\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2011.

International financial institutions have \ntherefore been supporting the government\u2019s reform initiatives, including \na stand-by arrangement with the IMF. The lack of a political consensus \nhas prevented agreement on the next steps in the country\u2019s medium-term \nadjustment strategy, though these are expected to be resolved in due \ncourse. \n\nReducing income disparities between Mal\u00e9 and the atolls is \n\nimportant. Private sector development, especially promotion of micro-, \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises outside Mal\u00e9, is therefore critical. \nSuch promotion is also an important mandate of the government through \nits decentralization policy.\n\nWeak institutions and human resources are major constraints. \nPublic sector institutions face capacity constraints, since pay in the civil \nservice lags far behind the private sector, and second jobs among public \nemployees are common. While heavy reliance on expatriate labor has \nallowed the Maldives to grow strongly for many years, the downside is \nthat existing institutions do not have adequate capabilities. \n\nAs one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable nations to sea-level rise, the \n\ngovernment has announced plans to become the first carbon-neutral \ncountry in the world within a decade. It is preparing an investment plan \nalong these lines, and hopes that it will not only serve as a blueprint for \nother nations but also draw world attention to climate change. \n\n3.18.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n5.0\n\n8.0\n\n5.0\n\n7.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nCurrent account balance \n\n-35.0\n\n-35.0\n\n3.18.6  Current account indicators\n\nCurrent account balance\nTransfers\nGoods trade\n\nServices trade\nIncome\n\n% of GDP\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n2005\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2011.

Fiscal prudence continued. Growth will fall below the 5-year average of 4.0% in \nFY2011, primarily reflecting the protracted postconflict transition process, but a modest pickup is foreseen in \nFY2012,  supported  by  tourism  and  more  vibrant  construction  activity.  Key  risks  to  growth  are  further  delay \nto completing the transition,  high  food  and  oil prices,  and  potential  impact of  unrest in the Middle East. \n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth inched up to 4.0% in FY2010 (ended 15 July 2010) from \n3.8% in FY2009 (Figure 3.19.1). The marginal improvement was made \npossible by a turnaround in growth in the relatively small industry sector \n(helped by fewer political strikes), and sustained expansion of services. A \ndeceleration in remittance inflows due to the lagged impact of the global \nfinancial crisis weighed on economic activity, as did slowing agricultural \noutput (for a second year) due to a sparse monsoon. \n\nThe deceleration in remittance growth, alongside commercial banks\u2019 \nexcessive lending to real estate and reduced liquidity in banking, drove \ninterbank borrowing rates to a record high. Inflation stayed close to \ndouble digits owing to high food prices in the first half of FY2010 \n(Figure 3.19.2), which in turn originated in a low domestic crop and \nIndia\u2019s high food-inflation. \n\nExports as a share of GDP have been dwindling in the last few \nyears, because low productivity and infrastructure bottlenecks have \nundermined competitiveness. Conversely, imports as a share of GDP \nhave been showing a trend increase over several years, with growth more \npronounced in FY2010, as gold imports swelled. (Gold was the investment \nof choice, given paucity of attractive alternatives in a correcting real estate \nmarket.) \n\nThe widening trade deficit, coupled with slowing remittances, took \nthe current account deficit to 2.7% of GDP in FY2010 from a surplus of \n4.2%\tof\tGDP\tthe\tyear\tbefore.\tThis\tled\tto\ta\t$113\tmillion\tdecline\tin\tofficial\t\nreserves.\tThe\tauthorities\taccessed\t$42\tmillion\tfrom\tthe\tInternational\t\nMonetary Fund through its Rapid Credit Facility, which provides \nconcessional assistance to low-income countries to tide them over \nexternal shocks. \n\nPrevious years\u2019 fiscal stability was maintained, with the deficit \nnarrowing from 3.3% of GDP in FY2009 to 2.0% of GDP, though this \napparent improvement stems from delayed approval of the FY2010 budget \nand from a continued difficult environment for implementing projects, \nwhich kept capital spending to only 70% of target.

Small fiscal deficits and large grants by multilateral agencies have \nhelped to improve the public debt position in recent years (Figure 3.19.3). \n\nDespite a challenging political environment, the share of the \n\npopulation\tliving\tbelow\tthe\tnational\tpoverty\tline\tof\tabout\t$160\ta\tyear\tis\t\nestimated to have declined to 25% in 2010 from 31% in 2004, largely owing \nto robust remittance inflows, rapid urban growth, a decline in fertility, \nand rising agricultural wages. \n\nStrides have also been made in other Millennium Development Goals, \nsuch as child and maternal mortality, although greater efforts are needed \nto achieve similar progress in areas such as productive employment \nand child malnutrition. Efforts are also needed to reduce inequality\u2014\ncurrently the highest in South Asia, with a Gini coefficient of 0.47. \n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic performance in FY2011 and FY2012 will rest primarily on \nprogress in the postconflict transition process\u2014currently slow as seen \nin the 1-year extension, to May 2011, of the tenure of the Constituent \nAssembly that was elected to draft a new constitution. The political \nvacuum and drift created following the Government\u2019s resignation in \nJune 2010 ended only in February this year. The FY2011 budget was \npromulgated only by ordinance 4 months into the fiscal year. \n\nAll these delays reflect the difficult transition that Nepal is suffering. \nWith little time left for writing the constitution, many of the contentious \nissues, such as army integration and state restructuring, have yet to be \nresolved. \n\nThe protracted transition and the associated political disruptions \n\nhave hit the economy. The delay in announcing the FY2011 budget, \nfor example, has undermined solid progress made recently in revenue \nmobilization, which achieved 25% average annual growth in the last \n4 years (Figure 3.19.4). More important, it has deprived the population \nof a much hoped-for peace dividend, including greater capital spending \n(Figure 3.19.5) and development benefits. \n\nGDP growth is forecast to weaken slightly to 3.8% in FY2011. \nAgriculture is expected to grow by 4.0% in FY2011 (up from 1.3% in \nFY2010), largely due to a weather-induced recovery in the output of key \nsummer crops (Figure 3.19.6). This improvement will not, however, be \nenough to offset the deceleration in nonfarm activities.\n\nPolitical uncertainty, as well as power cuts (lasting as much as \n14 hours a day since mid-February this year) will continue to take a toll \non nonfarm activities. The tightening FY2011 monetary policy of Nepal \nRastra Bank (NRB, the central bank), aimed at stabilizing the real estate \nmarket, will further curtail services expansion, to 4.5% growth in FY2011, \ndown from 6.0% in FY2010. A slowdown in construction activity and \nhigher fuel costs will limit industry\u2019s growth to 1.0% in FY2011, compared \nwith 3.3% a year earlier.\n\nGDP growth is expected to improve modestly to 4.0% in FY2012 \n(assuming continued normal weather conditions).

A modest uptick in construction activity, as \nNRB\u2019s policy is absorbed, should lift industry\u2019s growth to 1.5%. \n\n3.19.6  Change in summer crop output\n\nPaddy\n\nMaize\n\nMillet\n\nYear-on-year inflation reached 11.3% in January, largely reflecting \n\nfood and fuel price increases. A revision of the consumer price \nindex\u2014lowering the weight for food in line with the Fourth Household \nBudget Survey, 2005/06\u2014has pulled calculated inflation down by about \n1 percentage point relative to the previous method. \n\nAverage inflation for FY2011 is expected to be 10.0%. High food and \noil prices and the domestic distortions such as power cuts will continue \nto exert upward pressure, only part of which will be offset by the good \nharvest. With likely moderation in Indian prices (see the chapter on \nIndia) and the government\u2019s measures to prohibit transport syndicates\u2019 \nrestrictive practices (which have contributed to higher prices), 8.0% \naverage inflation is expected in FY2012. \n\nIt is assumed that NRB will not tighten monetary policy further in \nthe rest of FY2011 and FY2012 for two main reasons. First, the current \npolicy stance has already considerably slowed real estate activity. A \nfurther tightening could trigger a disruptive correction in house and land \nprices, worsening the quality of commercial banks\u2019 loan portfolios and \npotentially posing a threat to macroeconomic stability. \n\nSecond, the expected moderation of Indian inflation will probably \n\nobviate any need for monetary tightening. NRB\u2019s attention is likely \nto be focused on establishing confidence in the banking system and \nenhancing its supervision capacity. The vulnerability of the commercial \nbanking system has increased significantly in recent years due to a rapid \nemergence of other financial institutions (Figure 3.19.7). Recurring bank \nliquidity crunches are manifestations of this vulnerability, as deposits \nhave reportedly been shifted from major commercial banks toward \nsmaller financial entities that offer higher deposit rates, are difficult to \nsupervise, and appear to take on riskier lending. \n\nAfter sharply deteriorating in FY2010, the external position has since \n\nrecovered significantly (Figure 3.19.8). Although the oil import bill is \nsoaring because of higher prices, overall import growth has slackened, \nmirroring remittance inflows. \n\nExports have picked up, partly in response to the tax incentives for \nexporters announced in the FY2011 budget. As a result, the merchandise \ntrade\tdeficit\thas\tbeen\tlimited\tto\t$2.0\tbillion\tin\tthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\tFY2011.\t\nRemittances and tourism receipts have offset 90% of this deficit. After an \napproximate 4% fall in FY2010, external reserves recovered this loss in \nthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\tFY2011,\tto\treach\t$2.8\tbillion\tin\tJanuary\t2011,\tworth\tabout\t\n6 months of imports (Figure 3.19.9). \n\nBoth domestic and external factors will challenge any further \n\nstrengthening of the balance of payments in FY2011. Domestic \nmanufacturing is plagued by low productivity and poor infrastructure. \nImport growth will likely accelerate on higher oil prices, although it will \nbe somewhat offset by remittance inflows, which were growing at about \n18% in the first half (Figure 3.19.10). A current account deficit of 0.5% of \nGDP is expected in FY2011 and FY2012, reflecting little change in trends. \nAn escalation in political disruptions, if the peace process bogs \ndown, is the key downside risk to growth prospects. A further risk is \nan abrupt downward correction in the real estate market, which would \n\n%\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n%\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n-25\n\nNumber\n21,000\n\n18,000\n\n15,000\n\n12,000\n\n9,000\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\n11\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. \nClick here for figure data\n\n10\n\n09\n\n3.19.7  Financial institutions\n\nFinance companies\nDevelopment banks\nCommercial banks\n\nCooperatives\n\nNumber\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSource: Nepal Rastra Bank. 2011.

Given the high volume of \ncommercial bank lending for real estate, surging loan defaults would \nrepress normal financial activity. \n\nExternally, the unrest in the Middle East is an emerging risk to the \nsteady remittance inflows as the region is a key destination for Nepalese \nmigrant workers. The recent earthquake in Japan could also hit Japanese \ntourist arrivals and aid flows to Nepal. An additional external risk is the \nsurge in oil prices which could severely strain Nepal\u2019s external position \nand cause a supply shock if domestic prices are not adjusted accordingly. \nNepal also remains vulnerable to high global food prices.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nCreating jobs for the country\u2019s burgeoning young population is a major \nchallenge; unless managed properly, it could put at risk the country\u2019s \neconomic growth prospects. Some 450,000 workers enter the labor \nmarket annually. More than half of them seek\u2014and get\u2014jobs in the \nMiddle East and East Asia, particularly low-end work in construction and \nmanufacturing. But it is Nepal that bears the social costs. \n\nWhile under- and unemployment are widespread in all segments \n\nof the population, the position is particularly depressing for youth. \nTheir nationwide unemployment rate is twice the national average. It is \neven worse in urban areas, where the decade-long conflict, lack of job \nopportunities in rural areas, and the concentration of higher level education \ninstitutions there have contributed to an influx of younger people. \n\nLabor laws in Nepal\u2014the most rigid in South Asia\u2014are a major \n\nblock to job creation, and need to be reformed to facilitate quicker \nrecruitment and release of workers. Moreover, the academic curriculum \nneeds to be modified to reflect labor market needs and to facilitate \nself-entrepreneurship, in part to capitalize on close ties to India and its \nprominence as a business services hub. \n\nProgress toward completing the peace process, thereby leading to \nstronger investor confidence, will be important for faster job creation. \nThe policy agenda should aim to strengthen business security, reduce \nred tape on firms\u2019 entry and exit, and scale up current initiatives, such as \nincentives for entrepreneurs in tourism. \n\nFinally, the authorities should continue to work on developing a \nclear policy for public\u2013private partnerships. It would assist the country \nto unlock the massive hydropower potential, paving the way for large \ninfrastructure projects\u2014their implementation has so far remained elusive. \n\n3.19.9  Foreign exchange reserves\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\nSource: Nepal Rastra Bank. 2011.

Floods  in  summer  2010  hit  agricultural  output  and \ndamaged  transport  and  communication.  Still  high  inflation,  though  recently  falling,  may  well  accelerate. \nFiscal  developments  are  worrisome:  the  rollback  in  recent  oil  price  rises,  a  partial  increase  in  electricity \ntariffs,  delays  in  carrying  out  revenue-increasing  measures,  broad  tax  exemptions  for  residents  of  flood-\naffected  areas,  and  continued  heavy  fiscal  support  to  state-owned  enterprises  add  to  pressures  on  the \nfiscal  deficit.  The  current  account  balance  is  improving,  but  capital  and  financial  inflows  continue  to \ndecline.  Still,  despite  devastation  and  economic  distress,  growth  will  likely  stay  positive.\n\nEconomic performance\nPakistan\u2019s economic performance in FY2010 (ended June 2010) and into \nFY2011 reflects largely the same structural weaknesses that contributed \nto its FY2008 macroeconomic crisis. Energy shortages and security issues \nheld the economic rebound for FY2010 to 4.1% (Figure 3.20.1), slowing \ngrowth for FY2008\u2013FY2010 to an average of only 3%, well below the 8% \nneeded to create jobs for the predominately young population. \n\nLittle recent progress has therefore been made in raising per capita \nincomes or reducing poverty. Delays in implementing policy measures \nand fiscal management practices necessary for macro stability have \nundermined investment in infrastructure and production capacity.\n\nThe modest expansion in FY2010 benefited from fiscal and monetary \n\npolicies in FY2009 that eased macroeconomic imbalances by year-end, \nand from a decline in inflation that improved consumer confidence. \nHigher remittances provided additional support to an expansion of \nprivate consumption, as did improvements in rural income from increases \nin administered commodity prices. Heightened security concerns lifted \npublic consumption, pushing total consumption\u2019s contribution to growth \nto nearly 80%. \n\nFrom the supply side, transitory improvements in large-scale \nmanufacturing partly reversed 2 years of declines and supported a \nrecovery in services, led by wholesale and retail trade. Agriculture \nexpanded by a modest 2%, due to weak performance by major crops.\n\nThe fragility of the recovery was underscored by continued investment \n\ncontractions. Infrastructure shortages and security issues contributed \nto a 5.1% decline of gross private capital formation. Gross fixed capital \nformation contracted by 2.0% in FY2010, coming on the heels of an 11.3% \ndecline the previous year. \n\nFY2010 also saw a third consecutive year of declines in investment \nin large-scale manufacturing (down 15.4%) and electricity and gas (11.0% \nlower). Overall, the steady decline in total gross fixed investment as a \n\nThis chapter was written by Dawn Elizabeth Rehm of the Central and West Asia \nDepartment, ADB, Manila; and Farzana Noshab of the Pakistan Resident Mission, ADB, \nIslamabad.\n\n3.20.1  GDP growth by sector\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\n6.8\n\n5.8\n\n3.7\n\n1.2\n\n4.1\n\nServices\n%\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance.

Private savings have similarly declined, \nowing in part to the failure of key asset rates to keep pace with inflation, \nleading to either negligible or negative real returns.\n\nPakistan\u2019s fiscal balance deteriorated in FY2010, reflecting delays \n\nin putting through planned policy measures to improve revenue \nperformance and limit the burden on the deficit of losses at state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) and of energy-related subsidies. It widened from 5.3% \nof GDP in FY2009 to 6.3% in FY2010 (Figure 3.20.3), well in excess of the \n(revised) target of 5.1%. Revenue targets in the FY2010 budget, too, were \nmissed and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) tax receipts continued to \ndecline as a share of GDP, reaching a 30-year low of 9.0% in FY2010.\nPakistan\u2019s current budget expenditure is relatively rigid, and it is \ndifficult to offset overruns in one category with reductions in another. \nInflexible current expenditure (such as security, interest, and pensions) \nalone absorbed revenue of 7.4% of GDP in FY2010, or about 82% of FBR \ntax receipts. Subsidies amounted to another 1.7% of GDP. \n\nThe government sharply curtailed the federal public sector \n\ndevelopment program (PSDP) to 3.5% of GDP to ease deficit pressure. \nFederal government borrowing from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the \ncentral bank, as well as from commercial banks rose to PRs339.7 billion \n(2.3% of GDP), reflecting a widening deficit and lower external financing. \nEscalating losses from SOEs reached an estimated 1.7% of GDP for \nFY2010, adding to pressures.\n\nInflation fell to 11.7% in FY2010 from 20.8% in FY2009 (Figure 3.20.4). \n\nAs it moderated, the SBP lowered the policy rate in steps from 14% to \n12.5%. Broad money expanded by 12.5%, much faster than the 9.6% of the \nprevious year.\n\nDevelopments in the external balances were mixed (Figure 3.20.5): \nthe current account deficit narrowed, as imports declined by 1.7% with \nweaknesses in key industries (such as steel and oil refining) and a slump \nin investment; exports expanded by a modest 2.9% on higher exports \nof textiles, rice, and pharmaceuticals. Improvements in the service and \nincome accounts contributed.\n\nYet financing the current account deficit became more difficult over \nthe year: the capital and financial accounts fell by almost 13.4%, after a \n26.2% decrease the year before. Foreign direct investment flows continued \ntheir downward path in response to infrastructure and security concerns, \nwith communications, transport, and power accounting for much of the \ndecline. \n\nGross reserves improved, benefiting from International Monetary \nFund\t(IMF)\treleases\tunder\ta\tstand-by\tarrangement,\trising\tto\t$16.8\tbillion\t\nby end-FY2010. The nominal exchange rate depreciated by 6.3%, but \ninflation\u2014high relative to trading partners\u2019\u2014lifted the real exchange rate \nby 1.0%.\n\nPakistan\u2019s public debt (excluding guarantees) as a share of GDP \ncontinued to climb in FY2010 (Figure 3.20.6). Government domestic debt \namounted to 37.0% of GDP, including commodity debt and liabilities \nof SOEs. External debt rose to 31.9% of GDP, including 0.6% of GDP \nin external liabilities of SOEs.

With domestic \nprices higher than international prices, excess inventory was not sold. As \nthis inventory looked as if it would not be sold nor loans repaid, banks\u2019 \nlending rates for government commodity operations rose, to exceed those \nfor the private sector.\n\n3.20.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2.5\n\n16.0\n\n-1.7\n\n3.7\n\n13.0\n\n-2.3\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.20.7  Large scale manufacturing index\n\n1999\u22122000 = 100\n250\n\nWith growth prospects reduced to 2.5% for FY2011 (Figure 3.20.8), \n\n3.20.8  GDP growth\n\nProspects\nSevere floods in July\u2013August 2010 have affected FY2011\u2019s prospects. \nDamage was less severe than initially feared, but agriculture and \ncommunications were hit hard. Total damage is put at more than \n$10\tbillion,\thalf\tin\tagriculture.\tFor\tother\tareas,\tnotably\tpower\tand\t\ntransport, damage was mild but widespread. \n\nInformation for the first 6 months of FY2011 points to a 1.7% \n\ncontraction of large-scale manufacturing centered on textiles, \nfood processing, and petroleum products, bringing the large-scale \nmanufacturing index for September 2010 to its lowest since July 2007 \n(Figure 3.20.7). \n\naverage growth for FY2008\u2013FY2011 is seen falling to 2.9%. Persistent \nenergy shortages and security issues are expected to hold growth to 3.7% \nfor FY2012, providing scant improvement on recent trends.\n\nInflation accelerated after the floods, to 15.7% in September, reflecting \nactual and expected shortages. It remained above 15% through December, \nfalling to 14.2% in January owing to a government-freeze on oil and \nelectricity prices. It is expected to stay high through FY2011, for an \naverage annual 16.0%, and is then expected to recede in FY2012 to 13.0% \n(moderation in international food prices is likely to be at least partly \noffset by electricity price rises).\n\nPakistan began FY2011 with a budget that was based on policy \n\nmeasures that proved difficult to carry out. Revenue targets called for 26% \ngrowth of tax receipts, well over the 5-year average of 14%. Meeting them \nwould have been hard even if a reformed General Sales Tax had come \ninto effect. A reformed tax was initially scheduled for July 2010, but the \nprocess remains politically contentious, and any changes to the tax will \nhave a limited effect on FY2011 receipts. \n\nThis tardiness, combined with the impact of the floods and wide tax \nexemptions for those in flood-affected areas, held FBR tax revenue growth \nto 10.9% in the first 7 months of FY2011, making a further decline in the \ntax-to-GDP ratio likely (Figure 3.20.9). (Total fiscal resources have also \nbeen affected by declines in nontax revenue.)\n\nCurrent expenditure was under pressure due to a 50% wage increase \n\nfor government workers, exacerbated by government failure to budget \nadequately for subsidies needed to cover the gap between notified \nand cost-recovery electricity tariffs.

Part of this gap was to \nbe covered by 2% monthly increases in electricity tariffs to bring them \ninto line with cost recovery. Energy-related circular debt (due to payment \narrears in the sector), which stood at PRs446 billion at end-FY2010, is \nexpected to surge by end-FY2011.\n\nFor a third year, overruns on recurrent spending were met with a \ncompression of the federal PSDP (Figure 3.20.10). For the first half of \nFY2011, only PRs66 billion was made available for PSDP activities, less \nthan 25% of the PRs280 billion earmarked in the FY2011 federal budget, \nwith spending limited to key projects and priority development programs. \nThe federal PSDP for FY2011 faced a further cut of PRs100 billion on \na lack of resources. The government is giving priority to completing \nprojects. The remainder of the PSDP (PRs373 billion) in the combined \nprovincial budgets is also under substantial pressure from resource \nconstraints.\n\nWith a fiscal deficit at 2.9% of GDP in the first half of FY2011, the \nannual fiscal target was also revised to 5.5% under the weight of higher \ninternational food and energy prices, escalating subsidies, and subdued \nrevenue performance. \n\nWith lower foreign funding, deficit financing is expected to rely \n\nheavily on the domestic banking system. After easing in FY2010, \ngovernment borrowing from that source has surged in FY2011, reaching \nPRs379 billion by 12 February, compared with PRs330.4 billion for FY2010 \nas a whole (Figure 3.20.11). Of this, about 34% reflected borrowing from \nthe SBP, consistent with commitments from the government in late \nJanuary to roll back borrowing from the SBP to September 2010 levels.\nCredit to the private sector picked up but remained on the low side \nfor various reasons. Banks expressed a preference for low-risk lending \nto government to offset flood-related increases in nonperforming loans, \nwhile weak postflood economic activity and rising borrowing costs held \nback demand for borrowing.\n\nThe pace of government borrowing from the banking system has \nsupported a rapid expansion of broad money and reserve money: broad \nmoney growth for FY2011 through 26 February 2011 was much higher \n(7.7%) than in the same period of FY2010 (5.7%); the equivalent figures for \nreserve money were 14.9.% and 10.6%. \n\nIn response to the increase in inflation and growing evidence of its \nlikely persistence, the SBP increased the policy rate in three successive \n50 basis point increments from August 2010 to end-November 2010, \nbringing the rate back to 14.0% and reversing the cuts of FY2010 \n(Figure 3.20.12). In January 2011, the SBP left the policy rate unchanged, \npartly on the basis of commitments from the government to limit \nborrowing from the central bank.\n\nFiscal prospects for FY2012 are likely to improve as the political \nenvironment eases sufficiently to implement the revenue-enhancing and \nfiscal-management initiatives. Progress is expected in implementing \nreforms for the energy sector consistent with a move toward financial \nviability with a phased elimination of subsidy requirements, leaving \nenhanced fiscal space for development programs.\n\n3.20.10  Public sector development program\n\nLevel\nPRs billion\n700\n\n525\n\n350\n\n175\n\n0\n \n\nT \nA\nFY2007\n\nT\nA\nFY08\n\nA\nT \nFY09\n\nT\nA\nFY10\n\nT\nFY11\n\nA = Actual; T = Target.\nSource: Ministry of Finance.

Without a \nsufficient increase in 1-year bill rates, most purchases have shifted to \nshorter maturities of 3 and 6 months. In recent auctions, most banks\u2019 bids \nfor bills with a maturity longer than 6 months have not been high enough \nto be accepted. But with an average maturity falling to 1.5 years, the \npossibility of roll-over risk and disorder in the auction market rises. The \nlikely outcome is that, in time, the government will have to pay higher \ninterest rates to fund its borrowing requirements.\n\nPakistan\u2019s\texternal\treserves\treached\ta\trecord\thigh\tof\t$17.4\tbillion\tin\t\nearly February 2011 (Figure 3.20.13), amounting to more than 5 months \nof imports of goods and services.

For the first 7 months of FY2011, exports of textiles \nand rice showed strong growth in value terms, mainly on higher world \nprices. Remittances increased further, broadly in line with inflation, but \nnon-debt-creating inflows continued to decline, with private FDI inflows \nabout 16% below the same period of the previous year (Figure 3.20.14).\n\nThe current account deficit is expected to edge upward in FY2012 to \n2.3% of GDP as projected declines in global food and commodity prices \nare more than offset by the impact of improved growth and increased \ndemand for imports, including for postflood reconstruction.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nThe government recognizes that current subsidy requirements and \nsupport for SOEs are incompatible with creating the fiscal space needed to \nsupport investment in infrastructure and technology for a diversified and \nhigher-value-added export base. The current pattern of lower imports, \nlower development spending, and exploding unproductive current \noutlays undermines domestic and external confidence in the economy\u2019s \nprospects and deters investment. Pakistan therefore needs to develop a \nsystematically transparent revenue policy, and operate it effectively.\nElsewhere, energy shortfalls are lowering real growth by at least \n2 percentage points annually. While the federal government increased \nelectricity tariffs by 37% in FY2010, its decision not to push through with \nincremental monthly step-ups represents a reversal of its efforts to reach \ncost recovery. Again, it will be critical to design and implement policies \nthat bring the sector to financial viability.\n\n\fSri Lanka\n\nThe economy bounced back strongly in 2010, reflecting post\u2013civil war optimism and the global recovery. \nThe  outlook,  too,  is  positive  for  healthy  growth  provided  the  fiscal  consolidation  process  meets  targets \nand  the  burgeoning  inflation  pressures  are  addressed.  The  medium  term  presents  a  need  to  greatly  lift \nprivate  investment,  if  the  country  is  to  reap  the  full  rewards  of  the  peace  dividend.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy rebounded in 2010, with GDP growth estimated at 7.6%, \nafter 3.5% in 2009 (Figure 3.21.1). Continued benefits from the end of the \nlong-running civil conflict in 2009, such as improved business and tourist \nconfidence plus more land available to agriculture, as well as the global \nreturn to growth, underpinned the strong performance. The overall \noptimism was reflected in the stock market\u2019s doubling.\n\nWith the revival of paddy and fisheries production in the former \nconflict areas of Northern and Eastern provinces, agriculture grew at 6.5% \nin 2010. Good weather and fertilizer support by the government helped. \nWith the improved domestic business climate, the upturn in domestic \nand external demand, and gradually improving infrastructure, industry \ngrew by 8.0%. \n\nServices, which account for nearly 60% of GDP, recorded growth \nof 7.6%. This was mainly due to the expansion of wholesale and retail \ntrade, revival in tourism \u2014which contributed to robust performance in \nhotels and restaurants \u2014and the impressive performance of the banking, \ninsurance, and real estate subsector. Tourist arrivals leaped by 46% to \n654,477 in 2010, the highest number on record.\n\nAnnual average inflation as measured by the Colombo Consumer \nPrice Index reached 5.9% in 2010, up from a 25-year low of 3.4% in 2009. \nImport duty reductions and subsidies that maintained stable fuel prices \npartly reined in rising global commodity prices\u2019 impact on domestic \ninflation. Nevertheless, overall inflation increased steadily from midyear \nto reach 7.8% in February 2011, with the rise due to escalating food prices \nthat were 13% higher than a year earlier (Figure 3.21.2). Core inflation \nwas on a downward trend throughout 2010 that continued in the first \n2 months of 2011.\n\nCommercial banks\u2019 average weighted prime lending rate continued to \n\ndecline gradually in 2010 to 9.3% by year-end (Figure 3.21.3). The central \nbank reduced the reverse repurchase rate, the main policy rate, twice \n(and again in January 2011 to 8.5%). As interest rates edged down, growth \nin credit to the private sector came back strongly after 2009\u2019s shrinkage, \n\nThis chapter was written by Nimali Hasitha Wickremasinghe and Savindi Jayakody of \nthe Sri Lanka Resident Mission, ADB, Colombo.\n\n3.21.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP \n\nAgriculture \n\nIndustry \n\nServices \n%\n\n7.6\n\n7.7\n\n6.8\n\n6.0\n\n3.5\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Credit to the \nprivate sector increased by 25.1%, and broad money by 15.8%.\n\nPer plan, the government tightened the budget deficit to 8.0% in 2010 \n\nfrom 9.9% in 2009 (Figure 3.21.4). It took minor steps to expand the \nrevenue base, preferring to focus on simplifying the tax system, including \nreducing customs duty bands from five to four, removing the import \nduty surcharge, revising taxes relating to imports of motor vehicles and \nselected electronic items, and revising cess rates. Domestic revenue as a \nshare of GDP at 14.6% was only marginally above 2009\u2019s. Grants added \n0.4% of GDP to budget revenue.\n\nThe deficit narrowed therefore through current expenditure being cut \nby 1.5 percentage points as a share of GDP. All major categories of current \nexpenditure saw a reduction as a share of GDP, including salaries and \nwages, interest payments, and transfers and subsidies. As a share of GDP, \npublic investment was lower than in 2009, at 6.5%. Total expenditure was \n23% of GDP in 2010.\n\nThe ratio of government debt to GDP fell to an estimated 84% at \nend-2010 from 86% a year earlier but the total stock of government \ndebt increased by 11%. While the debt ratio has fallen in recent years, \nthe structure of debt has adversely changed, as the mix shifted \nfrom concessional external borrowing to higher-cost domestic and \nnonconcessional external borrowing. By August 2010, the share of \nconcessional debt had declined to 68% from 72.2% at end-2009. In \nSeptember 2010, the government issued its third international sovereign \nbond\toffering\tof\t$1\tbillion,\tafter\tissues\tin\t2007\tand\t2009.\tThis\tissue\twas\t\noversubscribed six times, with a yield substantially lower than the two \nprevious issues.\n\nAfter a 12.7% fall in 2009, exports recovered to expand by 17.3% in \n2010. Industrial exports accounted for 74% of export earnings (of which \nmore than half came from textiles and clothing) and agricultural exports \n25%. Exports to major regions increased even though the European Union \nwithdrew concessions under its Generalized System of Preferences Plus \nin August 2010. As the economy recovered in 2010 there was a marked \nincrease in imports (about 32%), though this upsurge in large part \nreflected higher global prices, especially of oil. The steeper rise in imports \nthan exports pushed out the trade deficit to 10.5% of GDP, from 7.5% a \nyear earlier.\n\nThe strong resurgence in tourism as well as freight- and port-related \n\nactivities brought an upturn in the services sector surplus. Growth \nmomentum in remittances continued, reaching 24%. These items helped \nto counterbalance the large trade deficit to hold the current account \ndeficit to 3.8% of GDP (Figure 3.21.5). Supported by healthy capital flows, \nthe balance of payments recorded an estimated overall surplus of about \n1.8% of GDP in 2010. Foreign direct investment strengthened sharply, \nto\tan\testimated\t$500\tmillion\tfrom\t$384\tmillion\tin\t2009,\tthough\tat\tonly\t\nabout 1% of GDP it is very low for an economy of Sri Lanka\u2019s size and \ndevelopment level.\n\nInvestor sentiment was strengthened by the simultaneous approval of \nthe third and fourth tranches of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nstand-by arrangement in June, and the fifth tranche in September, 2010. \nBoth Standard and Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s raised the country\u2019s outlook to \n\n3.21.3  Interest rates\n3-month Treasury bill \nPrime lending\nReverse repo\nRepo\n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n% of GDP\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. http://www.cbsl.lk \n(accessed 2 February 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.21.4  Fiscal indicators\n\nFiscal balance\nRevenue including grants\nExpenditure\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nBudget\n\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Sustaining such \nperformance will require fiscal consolidation, state enterprise and finance \nsector reforms, as well as flexible exchange rate management. \n\nServices and industry will lead growth in 2011; agriculture is likely \n\nto be hampered by heavy rains and consequent flooding that affected \nseveral provinces in January\u2013February 2011. Continued and planned \ninfrastructure- and tourism-related building will support construction \ngrowth, while services, especially hotels and restaurants, will perform \nwell, catering to the likely prolongation of the tourist boom.\n\nRising global food and oil prices and a shortfall in domestic supply \nof agricultural produce due to the flooding will stoke inflation, but only \nup to around 8%. In January 2011, the government reduced customs duty \non gasoline from SLRs15 a liter to SLRs5 to avoid passing through global \nprice rises. As with similar tariff-lowering steps on some imported food \nitems, the fiscal implications are unclear. A recent hike in electricity \nprices will also contribute to upward price pressures this year.\n\nIn a surprise move, the central bank cut policy rates in January even \nthough inflation was on an upward trend, reasoning that the prevailing \neconomic conditions provided the space for monetary relaxation to \nfacilitate greater private investment without creating inflation pressures. \nWith the economy now on a higher growth trajectory and inflation \npressures rising, however, monetary tightening may well be needed later \nin the year.\n\nThe budget deficit is expected to come down to 6.8% of GDP from \n8.0% in 2010, split equally between a 0.6% increase in revenue and a 0.6% \ncut in expenditure. Revenue buoyancy is likely, stemming from budget \nmeasures to simplify the tax system and move from tax concessions as the \nprincipal tool for attracting investment to increased economic activity.\nExpenditure is forecast to rise moderately in nominal terms as the \ngovernment is looking to cap public investments at around the 2010 level \nof 6%\u20137% of GDP. A sharp one-third increase in private investment is \nseen driving growth higher.\n\nThe budgeted fiscal consolidation is prudent, but meeting its target \n\nwill require further measures as the costs of the humanitarian and \nreconstruction expenses related to the flooding in 2011 and the reduction \nin customs duty on gasoline were not provided for in the budget adopted \nin 2010.\n\n\f176    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nThe government expects to move to a 5% of GDP deficit target in 2012. \n\nTo achieve this it would be necessary to look closely at closing loopholes \nin the tax system and to improve efficiency in tax collection, together \nwith further steps to broaden the tax base. Moreover, with infrastructure \ndevelopment a compelling priority, expenditure rationalization would \nhave to focus rigorously on recurrent expenditure.\n\nExport performance will depend on the recovery in Sri Lanka\u2019s major \nmarkets and is likely to grow by, say, 16% in 2011 and 2012. Rising global \nprices, especially of food items and petroleum, as well as high domestic \ndemand, are expected to push up imports by around one-third in 2011 \nand 2012. Higher remittances and net services receipts are expected to \nhold the current account deficit to some 4% in both years.\n\nFDI is projected to increase, supported by policy measures reinforced \n\nin the 2011 budget, including streamlining the role of the Board of \nInvestment and ensuring that incentives to unproductive investments are \ncanceled. The government wants FDI to hit about 3% of GDP this decade. \nThe reserve position is likely to remain strong, supported by capital flows \nand the IMF program.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nInvestment is too low to achieve national development goals, and \nprivate investment in particular needs to be scaled up substantially \n(Figure 3.21.8). But several areas need to improve to secure an \ninvestment climate conducive to large-scale private investments. The \n10-year development plan, the Mahinda Chintana, emphasizes the \nneed to improve the business environment more widely. The World \nBank\u2019s Doing Business 2011 report ranks Sri Lanka at 102 out of 183 \neconomies, suggesting the need to eliminate red tape. It also includes \nstrengthening institutions, building human resources capacity, and \nsimplifying procedures.\n\nThe finance sector requires development, as part of the thrust \n\ntoward macro stability and hence greater investment. Improvements are \nneeded in the legal framework for financial services and commercial \ntransactions, and more generally in strengthening and enforcing \nprudential norms. The challenge for Sri Lanka will be enforcing \ndifferent institutional and regulatory policy reforms in ways that are \neffective but without excessive bureaucracy.\n\nIt is also important to encourage both competition and consolidation \nin various parts of the finance sector to achieve efficiency and economies \nof scale. The capital markets are underdeveloped. Developing the \ncorporate bond market is important to diversify funding sources in order \nto reduce reliance on banks and the equity market.\n\n3.21.8  Fixed investment\n\nPrivate\n\nGovernment\n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2005\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Inflation  remained  subdued.  Growth  in  the  near  term  is  projected  to  return \nto  slightly  higher  than  recent  trend  levels,  in  a  context  of  low  but  rising  inflation.  The  major  challenge \nremains  diversifying  the  sources  of  growth\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy recovered by an estimated 2.0% in 2010, driven by higher \nproduction of oil and natural gas, stronger energy demand from \ntraditional export markets such as Japan and the Republic of Korea, \nexpansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) production, and the opening \nof a new methanol plant in May 2010. Production of hydrocarbons, \nincluding LNG, accounts for nearly half GDP. Nonenergy-related private \nsector activity picked up moderately.\n\nOn the demand side, recovery benefited from estimated rises of \n12% in private consumption and 10% in exports of goods and services. \nInvestment was likely flat.\n\nThe GDP contraction in 2009 was revised to 1.8%. In that year, \n\nproduction of oil and gas fell by 3.4%, and LNG output by 8.0% \n(Figure 3.22.1), largely a consequence of weaker external demand and \nmaintenance-related stoppages. Growth in the nonenergy sector in 2009 \nslowed to 0.9%, reflecting the impact of the global recession on trade, \ntourism, and manufacturing.\n\nContracting economic activity in 2009, with lower global commodity \n\nprices and a broadly stable Brunei dollar, brought inflation down to \n1.0%. Official data for the first 8 months of 2010 indicate that inflation \neased further, but the consumer price index likely picked up after that, in \ntandem with global commodity prices (most commodities are imported). \nAverage inflation for 2010 is estimated at 1.5%.\n\nPreliminary and unadjusted data indicate that the budget recorded \n\na\tdeficit\tof\tUS$192\tmillion\tin\tFY2009\t(ended\t31\tMarch\t2010),\tor\t1.7%\t\nof GDP. This was on the back of sharply lower tax and nontax revenue \n(dividends and royalties) from oil and gas, as well as higher current \nand capital spending.

Oil and gas production is expected \nto rise moderately and the new methanol plant will contribute a full year\u2019s \nproduction to GDP.\n\nPrivate consumption is forecast to rise and investment to pick up \nthis year as a result of construction projects and an improving business \nenvironment. Projects include the Pulau Muara Besar port (scheduled to \nbe completed by end-2012), an upgrade of the international airport, and a \npower transmission line between Brunei and Malaysia.\n\nInflation is seen rising in the forecast period, mainly due to higher \n\nprices for imported food. Still, it should remain relatively low at 1.5%, \ngiven the government\u2019s policy to subsidize many consumer items and the \ncurrency\u2019s peg to the Singapore dollar.\n\nThe current account surplus is likely to return to levels reached before \n\nthe economic contractions of 2008 and 2009\u2014about 50% of GDP\u2014on \nthe back of higher export receipts from oil and gas and a rebound in net \nincome inflows from the recovery in foreign asset prices. Demand from \nJapan for LNG could increase owing to damage to its nuclear industry \nfrom the March 2011 earthquake.\n\nA maritime border agreement reached with Malaysia will encourage \nexploration and foreign investment in oil and gas. Drilling has begun in \ntwo offshore exploration zones and an international company plans to \nbring a new gas discovery into production in about 3 years.\n\n3.22.2  GDP growth\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n 10 \n\n 11 \n\n 12 \n\nForecast\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.22.1  Development challenges\n\nThe long-term challenge is to make \nthe economy less dependent on oil and \ngas. The increase in the global price of \noil this year and next will likely lead to \nmoderately higher levels of production, \nbut could also quicken the depletion of \nhydrocarbon reserves (unless offset by \nnew discoveries).\n\nA gradual transition to more \ndiversified sources of growth will \nrequire progress in fostering a more \nconducive business environment for \nthe private sector, improvements \nin the institutional capacity of the \ngovernment, including service delivery, \nand finance sector development.\nThe authorities seem to have \nmade a start: according to the World \nBank\u2019s Doing Business 2011 report, \nBrunei Darussalam was in the top 10 \ncountries to have improved its business \nenvironment over the previous year. \nThe country climbed 19 places in ease \nof starting a business (to 133 out of \n183 countries)\u2014though this is still a \npoor ranking\u2014and ranks relatively \nwell in ease of paying taxes (22) and \ntrading across borders (52). However, \nthe ranking remains low in investor \nprotection (120), ease of obtaining \ncredit (116), and ease of doing \nbusiness (112).\n\nAs part of finance sector \n\ndevelopment, the government set up a \nBrunei Monetary Authority in January \n2011 to improve regulation and \nsupervision of the financial system.\n\n\fCambodia\n\nBased  on  a  rebound  in  tourism  and  clothing  exports,  recovery  in  2010  was  also  supported  by  a  good \nyear  in  agriculture.  However,  there  are  indications  that  poverty  has  increased  in  recent  years.  The  pace \nof  economic  growth  is  expected  to  pick  up  in  the  forecast  period.  Inflation  will  also  rise.  A  new  effort \nto  promote  rice  production  and  exports  goes  some  way  to  addressing  the  need  to  diversify  sources  of \ngrowth  and  reduce  rural  poverty.\n\nEconomic performance\nA bounceback in tourism and clothing exports, coupled with increased \nproduction of paddy rice, drove a 6.3% recovery in GDP last year \n(Figure 3.23.1) from a sharp slowdown in 2009 caused by the global \neconomic crisis.\n\nThe primary sector, producing about a third of GDP, grew by an \nestimated 4.2% in 2010. Paddy rice output rose by about 5% to 7.9 million \ntons, mainly a result of favorable weather and better access by farmers \nto fertilizers and higher quality seeds. Livestock production increased by \nabout 5.5%, whereas forestry and logging and fisheries output registered \nonly slight growth.\n\nRecovery in global travel saw tourist arrivals rise by about 16% to \n2.5\tmillion,\tand\ttourism\treceipts\tby\t14.5%\tto\t$1.78\tbillion\t(Figure\t3.23.2).\t\nThe sharpest gains were in arrivals from Asia, including Viet Nam (up \n48% to 466,700), the Republic of Korea (up 47% to 289,700), and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC\u2014up 39% to 177,700). This rebound in \ntourism contributed to estimated growth of 4.3% for services.\n\nIndustry was the main contributor to GDP growth in 2010, expanding \n\nby an estimated 11.6% (it had contracted in 2009). External demand for \nCambodian garments, principally from the United States (US) and the \nEuropean Union (EU), rebounded. Data from the US Department of \nCommerce showed that US garment imports from Cambodia rose by 19% \nin US dollar terms in 2010 (Figure 3.23.3). Construction activity remained \nsluggish, reflecting a fall in foreign investment in property during the \nglobal crisis and slow pickup in residential building.\n\nIncreased deposits of foreign currency at banks drove a 20.0% year-\non-year increase in M2 money supply in December 2010. Bank lending to \nthe private sector picked up from 6.5% year on year at end-2009 to 27% \n12 months later, reflecting the economic recovery. The riel appreciated by \n2.4% against the US dollar over 2010.\n\nA less expansionary fiscal stance saw the overall budget deficit \ntrimmed to an estimated 6.0% of GDP, from 6.4% in 2009.

Given that revenue \ncollection is still relatively low, the government aims to raise it by \n0.5 percentage points of GDP a year over the medium term.\n\nGovernment expenditure amounted to an estimated 18.6% of GDP, \nsomewhat above the 17.6% budget target but lower than the 2009 peak of \n20.5%. The higher than target spending was due principally to externally \nfinanced capital works. The deficit was largely financed by grants and \nconcessional loans, with the drawdown of government bank deposits \nestimated at 0.5% of GDP, much lower than the 2009 outturn of 2%.\n\nConsistent with a modest recovery in domestic demand, inflation in \n\n2010 averaged 4.0% (Figure 3.23.4), a turnaround from 2009 when the \nconsumer price index fell slightly in year-average terms.\n\nIn the external accounts, merchandise exports rose by an estimated \n20.8% in US dollar terms, largely reflecting growth in garment exports \nto the US. Imports rose by an estimated 15.9%, mainly on increases in \noil and in raw materials for garments.

Immediate priorities of this strategy \ninvolve the expansion of targeted programs such as free health care for \nthe poor, and the pilot testing of programs including conditional cash \ntransfers and labor-intensive public works.\n\nThe government last year adopted an ambitious plan to increase paddy \n\nrice production and promote the milling of rice for export, which should \nbenefit the 70% of the population that earns a living from rice. Targeting \n1 million tons of milled rice exports by 2015 (compared with just 13,000 \ntons in 2009, according to the official estimate), the plan includes steps to \nexpand irrigation facilities; improve the use of water, seed, fertilizer, and \nequipment; provide credit to farmers; encourage the private sector in rice \nprocessing and export; and reduce transport costs.\n\nLonger-term measures in the rice plan will focus on improving \nfarm yields and export competitiveness, for example by building roads, \nrailways, and ports, and by improving land management.\n\nReflecting the gradual expansion of the private sector, the number \nof licensed enterprises grew to 38,023 at end-2010 from 36,116 in 2009. \nThe government is eager to encourage new firms and new industries, but \n\nUS imports of textile and clothing from Cambodia\n3.23.3  United States imports of textiles and \nclothing from Cambodia\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n$ billion\nSource: US Department of Commerce.\nClick here for figure data\n\n2010\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n2007\n\n2006\n\n3.23.4  Inflation\n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\nInflation\n\nJan\n2009\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: National Institute of Statistics.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.23.5  Gross international reserves and \nimport cover\n\nGross international\nreserves\n\nMonths of imports\nof goods\n\n$ billion\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nMonths\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: National Bank of Cambodia.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nCambodia    183\n\ndeveloping the private sector is constrained by infrastructure deficiencies, \nincluding the high cost of electricity and lack of access to affordable \nfinance, especially for small and domestically focused firms.\n\nThe government adopted an anticorruption law in 2010 which, if \nwell implemented, could significantly reduce the costs of doing business, \nstrengthen the country\u2019s competitiveness, and improve public sector \ngovernance.

Consequently, milled rice exports to that market rose by 228% to \n10,495 tons in the first 2 months of this year from the prior-year period.\nConstruction is projected to expand by a modest 3% this year. \nThe government in 2010 liberalized restrictions on foreign ownership \nof apartments, which is expected to help stimulate some additional \ndemand. Offshore oil and gas production is expected to come on stream \nin late 2012.\n\nGrowth in services looks set to pick up to about 5% this year. \n\nTourist arrivals rose by 18% in January 2011 from the prior-year period, \nwhile trade and transport and communications are likely to continue \nexpanding, as domestic consumption and the business outlook improve. \nAgricultural production is seen increasing by 4.3%, supported by the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to promote rice production and exports.\nGovernment spending is forecast to grow marginally faster than \nrevenue in 2011, owing to increases in capital outlays, and the budget \ndeficit is expected to be 6.2% of GDP. External financing (concessional \nloans and grants from bilateral and multilateral lenders) will cover most \nof the deficit, leaving a shortfall equivalent to 0.9% of GDP (compared \nto an estimated 0.5% of GDP in 2010) to be financed by drawdowns on \ngovernment bank deposits at the central bank.\n\nUpward pressure on prices will be generated by the strengthening \ndomestic demand, generally expansionary fiscal policy, and higher global \nprices for food and fuel. Inflation is forecast to average 5.5% (Figure 3.23.7).\nThe planned increase in domestic financing of the budget, coupled \nwith the quickening of economic growth and inflation, suggests the need \nfor a gradual tightening of monetary policy during the forecast period. \nHowever, the high degree of dollarization of the economy (amounting \nto as much as 95% of currency in circulation) limits the effectiveness of \nmonetary policy.\n\n3.23.6  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\nGDP growth\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.23.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n6.5\n\n5.5\n\n6.8\n\n5.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nCurrent account balance \n\n-10.7\n\n-10.2\n\n3.23.7  Annual inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\nInflation\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n%\n28\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n-7\n\n\f3.23.8  Current account balance\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database\nClick here for figure data\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n184    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nThe trade deficit is expected to remain substantial, in part a result \nof the higher cost of imported oil in 2011. On the positive side, a rise in \ntourism receipts will contribute to a surplus in services trade. The current \naccount deficit (excluding official transfers) is forecast at 10.7% in 2011 and \n10.2% in 2012 (Figure 3.23.8). Gross international reserves are projected to \nrise\tto\t$2.84\tbillion\tin\t2011.\n\nRisks to the forecasts center on external events, such as unexpected \nglobal economic weakness or higher than assumed oil prices, which could \nhurt the prospects for Cambodia\u2019s tourism and clothing exports and push \nup inflation. Tourism could also be affected by any intensified conflict on \nthe border with Thailand or by renewed political strife in Thailand. Lack \nof progress on fiscal consolidation, with low tax revenue and absence of \ngovernment debt securities, may lead to problems in funding the fiscal \ndeficit. The relatively low involvement of Japan in Cambodia\u2019s trade, \ntourism, and foreign investment suggests a modest effect on the economy \nfrom the earthquake in Japan in March 2011. \n\nDevelopment challenges\nThe impact of the global recession on the economy highlighted the need \nfor Cambodia to reduce vulnerability to external shocks by accelerating \neconomic diversification and improving competitiveness of industries.\n\nSources of growth in recent years\u2014garments, tourism, and \nconstruction \u2014were all hit hard by the global downturn. A stronger \nagriculture sector would not only diversify sources of growth but also \nhelp to extend development to rural areas where 90% of the poor live. \nFood exports to Asian markets such as the PRC would reduce the heavy \nreliance on the US and EU clothing markets\u2014hence the government\u2019s \nefforts to promote rice production and milled rice exports.\n\nThe clothing and tourism industries are hampered by high costs \nfor electricity, until Cambodia builds its generation and distribution \ncapacities, and for trade, which involves numerous bureaucratic \nprocedures and unofficial fees. These industries need to raise the quality \nof their products and services and develop skills to support higher-value-\nadded activities.\n\nCooperation is increasing with neighboring countries to enable \nCambodia to tap into growing markets through increased connectivity. \nThe country lies at the heart of the Greater Mekong Subregion southern \neconomic corridor extending from Thailand to Viet Nam through \nhighways and railway links that form part of the Singapore\u2013Kunming rail \nproject. To meet competition in these markets and to strengthen value \nchains in agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, Cambodia needs to \nintensify efforts to reduce transport and logistics costs, especially at ports \nand border crossings.\n\n\fIndonesia\n\nA  welcome  increase  in  investment  and  expansion  of  private  consumption  contributed  to  a  quickening  in \nGDP  growth  in  2010,  as  external  trade  rebounded.  Economic  growth  is  forecast  to  step  up  this  year  and \nnext. Near-term challenges are to  curb inflation and manage surges in capital inflows, while reaching the \ngovernment\u2019s  medium-term  growth  target  requires  higher  levels  of  investment  in  infrastructure.\n\nEconomic performance\nA pickup in economic growth last year was driven by strong private \nconsumption, buoyant investment, and robust recovery in export \ndemand. GDP increased by 6.1%, recovering from a slowdown during the \nglobal recession in 2009 (Figure 3.24.1).\n\nPrivate consumption, supported by a strengthening labor market \nand rising prices for agricultural commodities, increased by 4.6% and \ncontributed 2.7 percentage points of GDP growth. \n\nFixed capital investment grew by 8.5% and contributed 2.0 percentage \n\npoints to GDP growth. Investment in machinery and equipment \nrebounded by 17.1%, from a contraction in 2009, while that in buildings, \nincluding infrastructure, grew by 7.0% in 2011. Investment\u2019s healthy rise \nwas underpinned by improvements in the domestic and global investment \nclimate, an appreciation of the rupiah, and growth in credit. Gross fixed \ncapital formation as a ratio to GDP rose to 32.2% (Figure 3.24.2).\n\nNet exports also contributed to GDP growth, but government \nconsumption did not, as the authorities unwound fiscal stimulus and \nlagged in disbursement of capital spending.\n\nFrom the supply side, services again came in with the strongest \nexpansion, at 8.4%, contributing 3.8 percentage points to GDP growth. \nTransport and communications recorded double-digit strengthening. \nIndustry grew by 4.7%, reflecting a modest recovery in manufacturing, \noffset in part by slower growth in mining and quarrying. Manufacturing \nis still hindered by poor infrastructure and stringent labor regulations, \nwhile mining activity slowed during periods of unusually heavy rain last \nyear.\n\nAgriculture grew by 2.9%, the weakest increase in 5 years, as it, too, \n\nwas set back by heavy rain.\n\nFood supply disruptions caused by the bad weather and by \n\ninfrastructure weaknesses drove inflation up from 2.8% in late 2009 to \n7.0% in December 2010 (Figure 3.24.3). It exceeded the central bank\u2019s \ntarget of 4.0%\u20136.0% in some months (the year-average rate was 5.1%). \nFood price inflation was running at nearly 16% late in 2010.\n\nFaced with rising inflation and a surge of capital from abroad, Bank \n\nThis chapter was written by Edimon Ginting and Priasto Aji of the Indonesia Resident \nMission, ADB, Jakarta.\n\n3.24.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nStatistical discrepancy\n\nInvestment\nNet exports\n\n6.3\n\n5.5\n\n6.0\n\n4.6\n\n6.1\n\nPercentage points\n9\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 21 February 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n35\n\n28\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n3.24.2  Gross fixed capital formation\n\n% of GDP\n\nGross fixed capital formation\n\n01\n\n02\n\n04\n\n03\n\n2000\n\n05\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 21 February 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n09\n\n10\n\n07\n\n08\n\n06\n\n\f186    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nIndonesia left its policy interest rate unchanged at 6.5% for 18 months \n(after cutting it by 300 basis points during October 2008\u2013August 2009). \nOnly in February 2011 did the central bank start to return the policy rate \nto more normal levels, edging it up by 25 basis points.\n\nBank Indonesia did, though, raise the reserve requirement for \ncommercial banks, from 5.0% to 8.0% in November 2010. This measure \nabsorbed an estimated Rp53 trillion of excess liquidity in the banking \nsystem (equal to about 3% of total bank lending). A 4.5% appreciation of \nthe rupiah against the US dollar in 2010 provided some cushion against \nimported inflation.\n\nCommercial banks passed on to borrowers only part of the central \nbank\u2019s policy rate cuts through August 2009. Credit growth was low until \nmid-2010, when it accelerated with economic activity, and was running at \nabout 22% by year-end (Figure 3.24.4). That was still a little below Bank \nIndonesia\u2019s target, in part because lending rates remained relatively high. \nBanks\u2019 gross nonperforming loans fell by 1 percentage point in 2010, to \n3.4% of total loans.\n\nRecovery in world trade and higher commodity prices produced a \n32%\tsurge\tin\tmerchandise\texports\tto\t$158.2\tbillion\tin\t2010\t(Figure\t3.24.5).\t\nExports of natural rubber more than doubled, and exports of palm \noil rebounded by about one-third.

This played a role in bringing back \ninto the formal sector many of the workers who had been laid off from \nthat sector during 2009\u2019s slowdown and had been working informally. \nMost new jobs created were in services.

Central government revenue rose \nby 19.5% from the previous year. Government spending was 6.5% below \nprojection, mainly because capital expenditure fell 20.6% short of budget.\nTotal spending on subsidies reached Rp214.1 trillion (3.4% of GDP), \n\n6.4% more than projected, due to higher electricity subsidies and \nexpansion of a program that provides rice to the poor. As a share of GDP, \ncentral government debt fell to about 26%, less than half its proportion in \n2004 (Figure 3.24.8).\n\nEfforts to improve the investment climate were illustrated by a \nreduction in the corporate income tax rate to 25% in 2010, the opening \nof a few more sectors to foreign investors, and new tax concessions for \ncertain investments. The government launched a new system to reduce \nthe time and costs of importing and exporting by allowing single \nsubmission, processing, and approval of import and export documents.\nRecognizing such improvements (as well as the macroeconomic \n\nperformance) the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report \nupgraded Indonesia\u2019s ranking by 10 places in 2010 to 44. \n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s raised its long-term foreign currency credit rating \n\non the country\u2019s debt from BB- to BB in March 2010, and Moody\u2019s \nupgraded its rating in January 2011 from Ba2 positive to Ba1 stable. Fitch \nraised its BB+ rating outlook from stable to positive in February 2011, \nwhich suggests an upgrade to investment grade within 12 months.\n\nEconomic prospects\nForecasts assume that the government will continue to improve the \ninvestment environment, and that last year\u2019s bad weather (which hurt \nagriculture and mining) is not repeated in 2011.\n\nPrivate consumption is forecast to expand on the back of increases in \nincomes brought about by the stronger labor market and high prices for \nagricultural commodities. Bank Indonesia\u2019s consumer confidence index \nrose sharply in January 2011 (Figure 3.24.9).\n\nPrivate investment is expected to remain robust, given projected \ngrowth in domestic consumption and in external demand for agricultural \nproducts and minerals. Investment is supported by the growth in credit \nand higher levels of confidence in the country. \n\nAs for public investment, the government has budgeted for a near \n30% rise in capital expenditure this year from the 2010 allocation, aimed \nat addressing infrastructure bottlenecks. Given chronic weakness in \nimplementing capital works programs, the budgeted amount is unlikely \nto be fully drawn. To address this issue, the government is simplifying \nbudget execution procedures and strengthening procurement capacity in \nspending agencies. It is also targeting higher overall spending and a wider \nbudget deficit, equivalent to 1.8% of GDP, which should support GDP \ngrowth.\n\n3.24.7  Unemployment rate\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n2005\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n3.24.8  Government debt\nCentral government debt\n\nDebt ratio\n\n% of GDP\n\nRp trillion\n1,800\n\n1,200\n\n600\n\n0\n\n03\n\n04\n\n02\n\n2001\n\n05\nSource: Directorate General of Debt Management. http://\nwww.dmo.or.id (accessed 14 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n08\n\n10\n\n06\n\n07\n\n09\n\nBasis points\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\nConsumer confidence index\n\n3.24.9  Consumer confidence index\n\nJan\n2009\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nNote: The index is constructed from a survey of Bank \nIndonesia among households.

Agriculture and mining are likely to put in better \nperformances than last year on the basis of better weather and high global \nprices for agricultural commodities, energy, and metals.\n\nOn this basis, GDP is forecast to expand by 6.4% in 2011 and 6.7% in \n\n2012 (Figure 3.24.11), stepping up from average growth of 5.6% over the \npast 7 years. The growth forecast for the next 2 years would be the best \nrates achieved since 1996.\n\nMerchandise export growth is forecast to decelerate to about 15% \nthis year, given the high base set by the rebound in 2010. The earthquake \nin Japan will likely have a brief and modest impact on exports (Japan \naccounts for about 12% of exports). Reconstruction there will stimulate \ndemand for Indonesia\u2019s energy and raw materials. Imports are projected \nto increase by about 17%, attributable to robust investment and consumer \ndemand. \n\nThe trade surplus is expected to rise modestly, but deficits in the \nservices and income accounts will widen due to higher freight costs \nassociated with larger trade flows and repatriation of profits and \ndividends. The current account surplus is seen declining to 0.5% of GDP \nin 2011 and 0.1% in 2012. The overall balance of payments is forecast to \nremain in surplus as a result of continued (but moderating) portfolio \ninflows and foreign direct investment.\n\nInflation was about 7% in the first 2 months of 2011 and is likely to \nremain relatively high through the first half of the year before moderating \nin the second half on base effects and an expected improvement in \ndomestic food supplies. For the full year, inflation is forecast to average \n6.3%. It will subside a little in 2012 if global food and commodity prices \ndecelerate as projected (Figure 3.24.12).\n\nDeviations in inflation from Bank Indonesia\u2019s 4.0%\u20136.0% target risk \neroding the credibility of monetary policy, thus entrenching expectations \nof higher inflation. If the current inflation pressure persists, the central \nbank is expected to gradually raise its policy interest rate to more normal \nlevels and is likely to allow the rupiah to appreciate further.\n\nTo address localized food shortages, the government has directed \nits rice procurement agency Bulog to intervene in the market to ensure \nadequate supplies. It has also expanded a program that distributes \n15 kilograms of rice each month to 17.5 million poor households and has \nsuspended import duties on some food items.\n\nBut inflation still poses a risk to the economic outlook. An \n\nunexpected sharp acceleration in prices could cloud the prospects for \ngrowth in private consumption, prompt a faster tightening of monetary \npolicy, and raise fiscal outlays on subsidies, possibly at the expense of \ncapital spending.\n\n3.24.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n6.4\n\n6.3\n\n0.5\n\n6.7\n\n5.8\n\n0.1\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.24.10  Business tendency index\n\nBusiness tendency index\n\nJun\n\nJun\n\nSep\n\nSep\n\nDec\n\nDec\n\nMar\n10\n\nMar\n2009\n\nMar\n11\nNote: An index higher than 100 means that business \nmanagers think that the current quarter will be better than \nthe previous one. \nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.24.11  GDP growth\n\nGDP growth\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n12\n11\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\nIndex\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n%\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nIndonesia    189\n\nWhen combating inflation, the authorities must also manage surging \ncapital inflows that exacerbate inflation and make the economy vulnerable \nto swings in investor sentiment. The focus has been on macroprudential \nregulation to damp short-term inflows. Bank Indonesia last year imposed \na minimum 30-day holding period for central bank certificates (SBIs), \nchanged auctions of these securities to monthly from weekly, issued \nlonger-maturity SBIs, and introduced a new term-deposit facility for \ncommercial banks to reduce the need to issue SBIs. The central bank \nintroduced higher reserve requirements for foreign currency deposits and \nstepped up its monitoring and reporting of foreign exchange transactions \nand capital inflows.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2011, Bank Indonesia limited banks\u2019 short-term \n\nforeign loans to a maximum of 30% of their capital and decided to rely \nmore on 9-month SBIs, further discouraging short-term investments.\nConcerns over the rise in inflation, coupled with international \nfinancial markets jitters in early 2011, resulted in some reversal of short-\nterm capital inflows.\n\nFor its part, the government proposed measures to Parliament to \ncushion the local-currency government bond market from capital flight. \nUnder them, funds from state-owned enterprises and the budget can be \nused to buy bonds in the event of a sudden capital reversal. In addition, \nBank Indonesia can draw on the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and \nbond buyback funds allocated in the 2011 budget to support the bond \nmarket.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nAlthough economic growth averaged 5.2% in the past decade, it remains \nbelow the 7%\u20138% rate recorded before the Asian financial crisis. This \nslowing of growth since the mid-1990s has been accompanied by lower \ngrowth in employment (Figure 3.24.13). The contribution of investment to \ngrowth has declined: the share of gross fixed investment in GDP fell from \n26% in 1991\u20132000 to around 24% in 2001\u20132009 (although it has recently \npicked up to 32.2% in 2010). The contribution of private consumption has \nrisen.\n\nFrom the production side, growth has been driven by the nontradable \n\nsector (Figure 3.24.14), mainly services, while the performance of \ntradables, particularly manufacturing, has been lackluster. Employment \ngeneration in manufacturing has been stagnant, so that a large proportion \nof the labor force works in the informal sector, where wages and \nconditions are usually poor.

Such space in the budget in the past 5 years \nhas been low, at the equivalent of 4%\u20135% of GDP (Figure 3.24.15). \n\nPursuing reforms in tax administration would help generate such \n\nresources. The number of registered taxpayers increased by about \n13 million in 2006\u20132010 and the tax-to-GDP ratio rose from 11.0% in \n2009 to 11.7% in 2010.

Savings could also be made by \nbetter targeting of subsidies and avoidance of duplication across different \nlevels of government.\n\nYet budget resources that were available were not always fully used. \nIndeed, the government has missed its budget deficit target by an average \nof 1% of GDP annually over the past 5 years, mainly because of an \ninability to complete spending programs. Moreover, a large proportion \nof budget spending is pushed through in the last quarter of each year. \nEfforts to improve budget execution by the public sector are getting \ngreater attention from the authorities.\n\n3.24.15  Discretionary expenditure\n\nRevised budget\n\nActual\n\n% of GDP\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n06\n\n2005\n\n09\nSources: Ministry of Finance; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n08\n\n07\n\n10\n\nActual\nRevised budget\n\n\fLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n\nStrong  demand  for  exports  of  metals  and  electricity,  coupled  with  a  recovery  in  tourism,  spurred \nGDP  growth  in  2010.  Similar  factors  are  forecast  to  underpin  a  slightly  higher  expansion  this  year  and \nnext.  But  inflation  has  been  rekindled,  so  far  at  moderate  levels.  A  central  challenge  is  to  preserve \nmacroeconomic  stability  while  pursuing  growth.\n\nEconomic performance\nAfter decelerating a little during the global recession, economic growth \npicked up to 7.5% in 2010 (Figure 3.25.1), returning to the average \nexpansion rate of 2004\u20132008. This prolonged period of growth mainly \nreflects substantial investment in mining and hydropower.\n\nIndustry, representing about one-quarter of GDP, grew by 18.0% in \n2010 and contributed most of the growth. Output of electricity more than \ndoubled as the Nam Theun 2 hydropower plant, the biggest in the country \nat 1,070 megawatts, reached full capacity in April. Some smaller new \nplants, including Xeset 2 and Nam Leuk 1 and 2, also started generating \npower. Most of their output is exported to Thailand (Figure 3.25.2).\n\nMining production rose by 19.0% last year, spurred by higher global \nmetal prices. Output of copper from the two main mines \u2014Phu Bia and \nSepon\u2014rose by 21.0% to 147,500 tons. Gold production rose by 7.0% to \n173,000 ounces and silver by 13.5% to about 500,000 ounces. \n\nConstruction activity benefited from expansionary fiscal and \n\nmonetary policies.\n\nThe global recovery in travel lifted the number of tourists by about \n25% to 2.5 million in 2010, with a strong rebound in tourism from Europe \nand the United States. That supported growth of 6.0% in the hotel and \nrestaurant industry. Other services to grow by at least 6% were financial \nservices, wholesale and retail trading, and transport and communications \n(boosted by the introduction of third-generation mobile telephone and \nInternet services). Services as a whole grew by 5.0%.\n\nAgriculture, in contrast, which accounts for a third of GDP but \nemploys about three-fifths of the workforce, suffered from bad weather \n(droughts followed by floods) as well as from diseases in pigs and cattle. \nProduction of rice, the main crop, increased by about 4% to 3.26 million \ntons and fisheries recorded solid growth of 7.0%. The sector as a whole, \nthough, grew by just 2.0%.\n\nConsumer prices were on an upward trajectory last year, putting \naverage inflation at 6.0%. Higher global oil prices pushed up the cost of \nfuel and transport, and bad weather and animal diseases disrupted food \nsupplies, raising food prices.

Bank credit expanded by 46% last year, moderating from over \n80% in 2008 and 2009. Growth in M2 money supply quickened to 39% in \n2010 from 31% in the previous year (Figure 3.25.3).\n\nMoving to counter inflation pressures, the Bank of the Lao PDR \nin September 2010 raised its policy interest rate, from 4.0% to 5.0% for \nloans of less than 1 week. It phased out direct lending for off-budget \ninfrastructure projects, which had been a cause of high rates of growth in \ncredit. However, disbursement of central bank lending committed in 2009 \ncontinued to feed credit growth.\n\nThe central bank also uses exchange rate policy to address inflation, \n\naiming to limit fluctuations in the Lao kip to 5% a year against major \ncurrencies. In 2010, the kip rose against the US dollar by 3.0% but fell by \n5.0% against the Thai baht (Thailand is a major source of imports).\n\nThe effectiveness of monetary policy is hampered by the widespread \n\nuse of the US dollar. To promote use of the kip, the government has \ndirected most of its revenue departments to accept only that currency \nand has asked wholesalers and retailers to use it for quoting prices. Such \nmeasures have helped to lower the level of dollarization to below 50% in \n2010, from a peak of 79% in 1999.\n\nStrong growth in government revenue, in part a result of high global \nprices for copper and gold, helped to rein in the budget deficit in FY2010 \n(ended 30 September 2010). Growth in spending moderated relative to \nFY2009, when the government had lifted outlays to cushion the impact \nof the global recession. The budget deficit, including grants but excluding \noff-budget spending, narrowed to an estimated 3% of GDP from 5.1% in \nFY2009. Including off-budget spending, it was close to 5%.\n\nHigher metal production and prices, along with the start of exports \nfrom Nam Theun 2, raised the US dollar value of merchandise exports \nby\tan\testimated\t30%\tto\t$1.9\tbillion\tin\t2010.\tMineral\texports\texceeded\t\n$1\tbillion\tfor\tthe\tfirst\ttime\tand\telectricity\texports\trose\tto\t$375\tmillion.\t\nShipments\tof\tclothing\tincreased\tin\tvalue\tby\tabout\t14%\tto\t$184\tmillion,\t\nmainly on better demand from Japan and the Republic of Korea.\n\nMerchandise\timports\trose\tby\tan\testimated\t13.5%\tto\t$2.8\tbillion.\tThe\t\ntrade and current account deficits narrowed, the latter to an estimated \n9% of GDP from 12% in 2009 (Figure 3.25.4).

If this \n5-year rail project starts as planned, it will likely have only a small impact \non GDP this year but a greater contribution from 2012.\n\nServices and construction are expected to maintain solid growth, \n\nbolstered by expansion of domestic demand and of tourism. Export \norders suggest that clothing shipments will increase by about 10% in 2011. \nFurther, agriculture is expected to return to trend growth of about 2%, \nif weather permits, while higher global prices for cassava, corn, and sugar \nare likely to encourage wider planting. Private investment in plantation \nand contract farming is laying the basis for production gains for coffee, \nsugarcane, and some other crops in the years ahead.\n\nTaking these factors into account, GDP growth is forecast to edge \n\nhigher to 7.7% in 2011 and to 7.8% in 2012.\n\nThe government has budgeted to increase spending by 23% in nominal \n\nterms in FY2011, and it expects revenue to rise by about 27% owing to \nprojected high prices for metals and April\u2019s rollout of the value-added \ntax. This would put the budget deficit at about 3% of GDP. On monetary \npolicy, the target is to restrain growth in M2 money supply to 20% and \nin credit to 25% in 2011. The phasing out of central bank lending for \noff-budget projects should facilitate this tightening.\n\nHigher prices for imported oil, coupled with growth in credit and \n\na possible further depreciation of the kip against the Thai baht, will \nmaintain upward pressure on inflation, which is projected at about 6.5% \nin 2011.\n\nMerchandise exports are forecast to rise by about 25% in value this \nyear, reflecting buoyant copper and gold prices and higher exports from \nthe Nam Theun 2 and Nam Ngum 2 power plants. Exports of clothing \nand farm products, too, are projected to increase. Merchandise imports \nwill likely grow at a slower rate than exports this year, but imports of \nmachinery and materials for new projects are expected to pick up in 2012. \nThe current account deficit is forecast to remain at around 9% of GDP in \n2011 before widening in 2012 as imports accelerate.\n\nThe stock of external public debt, most of which is on concessional \nterms,\thas\tincreased\tto\t$3.3\tbillion\tin\tabsolute\tterms,\tbut\tas\ta\tshare\tof\t\nGDP it has declined to 52% from 82% over 5 years, owing to the growth in \nthe economy and the kip\u2019s appreciation.\n\n3.25.1  Development challenges\n\nA central challenge is to pursue growth, \nas called for in the new development \nplan, while preserving macroeconomic \nstability. \n\nA related issue is banking system \nsoundness: high rates of growth in credit \nand a rapid expansion in the number of \nbanks (from 13 to 23 in the 3 years to \n2010) has increased risks for the banking \nsystem, which need to be addressed \nthrough vigilant supervision and a \nrecapitalizing of state-owned banks.\nEnduring challenges involve \nreducing poverty (the incidence was \nabout 27% in 2008) and, related to this \nimperative, diversifying the economy\u2019s \nnarrow base. Mining and hydropower \nhave limited potential for job creation, \nand a heavy reliance on mining leaves \nthe economy and the budget vulnerable \nto the inevitable downswings in global \nmetal prices. \n\nThese twin goals therefore require \ninvestment and reforms in agriculture, \nwhich still supports the majority of the \npopulation, and improvements in the \nbusiness environment to encourage a \nvibrant private sector.\n\nProgress on the latter depends heavily \non reforms in public sector management \n(including state-owned enterprises) and \nin public service delivery, as well as a \nmore transparent and predictable policy \nand legal environment. The country \nis near the bottom (171 out of 183 \ncountries) in the World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness 2011 ranking.\n\nTransparency International places \n\nthe country 154 out of 178 on its \n2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, \npartly because the implementation \nor enforcement of approved laws and \nregulations remains weak. \n\nThe government has strategies to \naddress governance and corruption, \nwhich focus on the public service, \npublic participation, rule of law, and \npublic finance. Their success will, \nthough, depend on commitment from \npolitical leaders to ensure enforcement.\n\n\fMalaysia\n\nA robust recovery  in 2010 was driven by stronger  domestic  demand  and  a  recovery in exports. Domestic \ndemand  is  expected  to  stabilize  and  GDP  growth  will  moderate  in  2011.  Inflation  is  forecast  to  rise  from \nlow  levels,  but  remain  contained.  The  official  goal  to  reach  high-income  country  status  by  2020  rests  on \neffective  implementation  of  a  landmark  but  intricate  structural  reform  program  launched  in  2010. \n\nEconomic performance\nStrong domestic demand and a recovery in merchandise exports drove a \n7.2% rebound in GDP in 2010 (Figure 3.26.1), after the global recession had \npushed the economy into a 1.7% contraction in 2009.\n\nPrivate consumption rose by 6.6% in 2010, buoyed by positive \nconsumer sentiment, favorable labor market conditions, and rising \ncredit to households and businesses. Public consumption was flat, \nreflecting reductions in operational expenditure as part of the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal consolidation efforts, which resumed (after a \nrecession-related hiatus) in 2010.\n\nInvestment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation and \nincluding public investment, surged by 9.4% and contributed most of \nthe total growth in GDP last year. Private investment benefited from an \nexpansion in production of domestically oriented manufacturing. The \nincrease in exports of goods and services (9.8% in real terms) was more \nthan offset by stronger growth of imports of goods and services (14.7%).\nOn the supply side, growth was supported by a relatively strong \nrecovery in manufacturing output (11.4%) and by robust growth in \nservices (6.8%) and construction (5.2%) (Figure 3.26.2). The recovery in \nmanufacturing, which accounts for just over a quarter of total output, \nwas driven by the strong growth in domestically oriented industries, \nnotably those supplying construction and consumers. Export-oriented \nmanufacturing was led by a surge in electrical and rubber products, and a \nmore moderate expansion in chemical products.\n\nServices, which account for 57% of GDP, experienced broad-based \ngrowth. The strongest gains were in real estate and business services, \ntransport and storage, and wholesale and retail trade. Construction \nactivity reflected a recovery in residential building, expansion in office \nand retail spaces, and progress in infrastructure projects. Agriculture, \nhowever, was subdued, as a rise in natural rubber production was largely \noffset by declines in crude palm oil and cocoa, while mining output was \nstagnant largely as a result of a 3.3% decline in crude oil production.\n\nInflation increased to average 1.7% in 2010, mainly owing to higher \nprices of food and drink and nondurable goods. Rising global commodity \nand energy prices lifted inflation to 2.4% year on year in January 2011 \n(Figure 3.26.3).

It raised the overnight policy rate three times during March\u2013July \n2010, by a cumulative 75 basis points, to 2.75%, and kept it there through \nthe rest of the year. The economy\u2019s output was still below its potential and \nthere were no strong signs that rising inflation stemmed from demand \npressures. Moreover, the appreciation of the ringgit against trading partner \ncurrencies, of around 10% in 2010, helped to damp imported inflation.\nLabor market conditions generally mirrored the rebound in \n\ndomestically generated economic activity. While the labor force increased \nby 2.2% in 2010, to 11.7 million, the number of people employed rose by \n2.5%, to 11.3 million.

This outcome was achieved mostly through a \nmodest increase in revenue and restrained operational spending.\n\nBy mid-2010, direct subsidies had risen to nearly 11% of federal \n\ngovernment operating expenditure, with over half going for fuel subsidies. \nMoving to rein in this cost to the budget, three times in 2010 the \ngovernment raised fuel prices (they are still lower than in neighboring \ncountries) and sugar prices by just over 10%.\n\nReflecting the reduction in the federal budget deficit, the ratio of \nfederal government debt to GDP declined from 54.0% in 2009 to 51.3% in \n2010. Only 3.5% of the public debt was external.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe outlook for the forecast period are predicated on two key \nassumptions (in addition to the Asian Development Outlook 2011 baseline \nfor the global economy). First, the surge in mostly short-term capital \ninflows stabilizes and does not generate inflation pressures. Second, the \ngovernment can quickly start carrying out its structural reform program \n(Box 3.26.1), which will require not only effective horizontal coordination \nacross line ministries and agencies but also vertical coordination between \nthe federal and state governments.\n\nOn this basis  \u2014and against the backdrop of slowing growth in \nexternal demand from major industrial countries, continuing domestic \nfiscal consolidation, and dissipating base effects \u2014GDP growth is \nprojected to moderate to 5.3% in 2011. \n\nDomestic demand is likely to be the key driver of growth, reflecting \nbroadly positive consumer and investor sentiment. Net exports are expected \nto exert a continued (though lightening) drag as the rate of growth of \nimports of goods and services stabilizes following the rebound in 2010.\nPrivate consumption is seen staying robust and benefiting from \nrelatively favorable employment, good real wages in manufacturing, \nrising commodity prices, and the accommodative financing environment. \nConsumer sentiment, for example, rose in the fourth quarter of 2010.\nPrivate investment is expected to pick up later in 2011\u2014the \n\nDepartment of Statistics\u2019 leading index rose by 2.7% in December last year \n(Figure 3.26.6). With ample liquidity, private investment is seen gathering \nmomentum as the government starts implementing its structural reforms.\nExports are projected to rise moderately in 2011, by 8.0%, as softer \n\ndemand from Japan and the US is only partly compensated by more \nrobust demand from Asia. Imports are foreseen to rise by 10.0%, reflecting \ncontinued imports of capital equipment and intermediate goods. The \ncurrent account surplus is likely to decline further in 2011, to 10.0% of \nGDP. The capital and financial account deficit is set to shrink, on the \nback of healthy portfolio inflows and FDI, bringing about an increase in \ninternational reserves.\n\nIn 2012, growth is forecast to remain at 5.3%, as the projected modest \n\nrise in export growth is offset by the anticipated adverse impact on \ninflation and domestic demand stemming from increased global food \nprices this year. Also in 2012, higher capital imports associated with \n\n3.26.1  Structural change\n\nThe goal of the structural reform \nprogram launched by the government \nin 2010 is to enable Malaysia to break \nfree of a middle-income trap and reach \nhigh-income country status by 2020.\nThe intended structural sea-\n\nchange is to be achieved by four main \napproaches: \n\u2022\t\n\ngenerating growth that is more \ninclusive and sustainable, through \nthe implementation of eight \n\u201cstrategic reform initiatives\u201d to \nease constraints to higher private \ninvestment; \nimplementing market-friendly \naffirmative action programs \nthat target the bottom 40% of \nhouseholds, many of which are in \nSabah and Sarawak; \nimproving public service delivery \nwhile reducing large and persistent \nfiscal deficits stemming in part \nfrom high subsidies; and \nplacing equal emphasis on \nprotecting the environment and \neconomic growth.\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nAn Economic Transformation \nProgram prepared with private sector \ninput identifies about 130 projects \nthat involve huge, primarily private, \ninvestment over 10 years. Another \n60 projects have been identified for \nsubsequent implementation.\n\nThe success of the structural \ntransformation, the first phase of \nwhich begins under the recently \nendorsed Tenth Malaysia Plan 2011\u2013\n2015, will be measured against set \nobjectives and delivery of impacts over \nthe next decade. \n\nIn the nearer term, the credibility \n\nof the program will be judged on \nhow well strategic reform initiatives \nimprove the investment environment, \nand how effectively the associated \nprojects are implemented, as measured \nby consumer and investor sentiment \nand higher actual investment. \n\n\f3.26.7  Current account balance\n\n5-year moving average\n\n% of GDP\n\nCurrent account balance\n\nEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nMalaysia    197\n\nstronger private investment are likely to outweigh the rise in exports, and \nthe current account surplus is expected to narrow to around 9.0% of GDP \n(Figure 3.26.7).\n\nThe 2011 budget aims for a slight reduction in the federal government \ndeficit to 5.4% of GDP by reducing gross development expenditure by 9% \nin ringgit terms from the 2010 outturn. \n\nInflation is seen rising this year, mainly reflecting global increases \n\nin food and fuel prices and reductions in fuel subsidies domestically. \nAverage inflation is put at 3.0% in 2011 and 2012 (Figure 3.26.8).\n\nWhile the monetary stance remains accommodative, large shifts in \nglobal liquidity\u2014including from potentially volatile portfolio inflows\u2014are \nbuilding liquidity in the domestic financial system. Bank Negara \nMalaysia, in a preemptive bid to help offset the risks of economic and \nfinancial imbalances arising from such a buildup, doubled the statutory \nreserve requirement of commercial banks to 2%, from 1 April this year. It \nhad already indicated in March that it might need to raise interest rates if \ndomestic demand rose and put upward pressure on prices. \n\nThe economy relies heavily on external markets, and the main downside \n\nexternal risk to the forecasts is a lower than expected recovery in demand \nfrom major industrial countries. The competitiveness of manufactured \nexports could be dented by further real appreciation of the ringgit. \nDomestic risks center on any apparent lack of progress by the \n\ngovernment\u2019s structural reform program, which includes steps to quickly \nimprove the investment climate. Such perceptions could drag down \ninvestor sentiment, inhibiting the required increase in private investment.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nOver three decades, Malaysia has largely eradicated poverty, built a \nworld-class infrastructure, and become a major exporter. Yet the country \nis stuck in a middle-income trap\u2014per capita gross national income was \naround\t$7,350\tin\t2009\u2014in\twhich\tthe\tstrategies\tadopted\tto\tattain\tthe\t\ncurrent level are inadequate to take it to the next stage.\n\nThe ratio of private investment to GDP has stagnated at below 25% \n\nof GDP for a decade, compared with rates of over 30% of GDP in the \nmid-1990s, partly because doing business in Malaysia is still too difficult. \nThe country is also losing its attractiveness as an investment destination, \nseen in its falling ranking in the Global Competitiveness Index\u201426 in \n2010 (Figure 3.26.9).\n\nAnother vulnerability is that exports are heavily concentrated in \nelectrical and electronic products\u2014eventually destined for industrial-\ncountry markets where demand is volatile\u2014and primary commodities \n(such as petroleum and palm oil) whose prices are volatile. Both types \nof export generate little value added and employ workers mainly of \nlow-skills on low-wages. And although labor productivity is growing, it \nis doing so slowly, inhibiting creativity and innovation. Socially, the gap \nbetween rich and poor is widening.\n\nIt is in this context that the government has embarked on its \n\nambitious structural reform program (Box 3.26.1). \n\n3.26.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n5.3\n\n3.0\n\n10.0\n\n5.3\n\n3.0\n\n9.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n%\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nRank\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.26.8  Annual inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n09\n\n08\n\n07\n\n10\n\n2006\n\n12\n11\nForecast\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.26.9  Global competitiveness \n\n08\n\n09\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n10\nNote: The Global Competitiveness Index covers 139 \neconomies.\nSource: World Economic Forum.

The \neconomy  is  expected  to  grow  moderately  over  the  forecast  period,  supported  by  foreign  investment  in \nconstruction  and  higher  levels  of  credit  to  agriculture.  The  government  that  took  office  in  March  2011 \nfaces  an  extensive  agenda  of  reforms  if  the  country  is  to  reach  its  potential. \n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth recovered to an estimated 5.1% (Figure 3.27.1) in the fiscal \nyear ended 31 March 2010 (FY2009), after slowing in the previous year \nowing to the impact of Cyclone Nargis and weakness in demand for \nimports from neighboring economies. The recovery in FY2009 was led \nby improved results from agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and the \ntransport and communications subsectors. Living standards remain low, \nhowever.\n\nAgriculture, including fisheries, forestry, and livestock, accounts for \nover half of employment and about 40% of GDP. Production from this \nsector picked up in FY2009 as areas damaged by the cyclone, mainly in \nthe Ayeyarwady and Yangon divisions, were gradually rehabilitated.\nMore recently, economic growth edged up to an estimated 5.3% \n\nin FY2010 (ending 31 March 2011), with a solid contribution from \nconstruction, particularly in Naypyidaw, the new capital, and Mandalay \n(a highway connecting these cities was under construction). Economic \nrecovery in neighboring countries that import goods including food and \nnatural gas from Myanmar supported the lift in growth in FY2010. \n\nAgriculture in FY2010 was sluggish, however, a result of persistent \ndrought in the central region and residual soil salinity in cyclone-affected \nareas.\n\n(Official GDP growth figures, which are considerably higher than \nthese unofficial estimates, are inconsistent with variables that are closely \ncorrelated with economic growth, such as energy use. Economic data are \nnot timely either, making it difficult to assess economic developments.)\n\nThe government has financed part of its fiscal deficit through Treasury \n\nbond issues in the past 3 years, rather than relying completely on money \ncreation to finance the fiscal gap. This approach has contributed to \nlowering inflation from over 20% to single digits in that period. Average \ninflation was estimated at 8.2% in FY2009 and 7.3% in FY2010.\n\nExport income from natural gas continued to support the external \naccounts. Export prices for gas fell by about 20% in FY2009, dragging \ndown\tearnings\tfrom\tthis\tsource,\tbut\treceipts\trecovered\tto\t$2.7\tbillion\tin\t\nFY2010 as demand from Thailand picked up.

Expenditure on \nthe construction of Naypyidaw remained a drain on the budget, while \nrevenue growth was sluggish. The practice of valuing exports of state \nenterprises\tat\tthe\tofficial\texchange\trate\tof\tMK5.5/$1\t(as\topposed\tto\tthe\t\nmarket rate) undervalues revenue available for spending.\n\nHigh administered bank interest rates (17% for lending and 12% paid \non deposits) discourage banks from buying the lower-yielding Treasury \nbonds. Consequently, bond issues funded only about one-third of the \nfiscal deficit in FY2010.\n\nThe government privatized several state assets in 2010, including \nan airline, 243 gasoline stations, public buildings, and rice distribution \noperations. Further asset sales are expected. \n\nEconomic prospects\nForecasts assume both normal weather patterns and a start to gradual \neconomic reforms by the government that took office in March 2011.\n\nA modest increase in rural incomes, owing to increased exports and \n\nprices of cash crops, is expected to underpin private consumption in \nFY2011. \n\nThe Myanmar Agriculture Bank doubled credit to farmers in 2010. \n\nFurther increases are planned in the next 2 years, going some way to \naddressing severe shortages of credit to agriculture. These moves, coupled \nwith the gradual easing of controls on agriculture over recent years, are \nexpected to stimulate production.\n\nInvestment is projected to rise in the forecast period, notably in \nconstruction. Projects planned or under way include new hydropower \nplants, gas fields, and oil and gas pipelines to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, largely financed by foreign investment. A Thai company agreed \nlast year to build a port, power plant, and industrial estate in Dawei in \nsouthern Myanmar starting this year, and a company from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China signed a contract to build an airport at Naypyidaw. \nGas production is projected to be fairly flat in the forecast period, \nbefore new projects come on stream in about 3 years. Gas export prices \nwill likely rise, together with global energy prices and solid demand from \nThailand. (This will have a limited impact on GDP because gas income is \nconverted at the official exchange rate rather than the market rate.)\n\nOn the balance of these factors, GDP is forecast to grow by about 5.5% \n\nin the next 2 years.\n\nInflation is projected at 8.0% in the forecast period (Figure 3.27.4), \nreflecting higher domestic demand and increased global prices of food \n\n3.27.2  International reserves\n\nLevel\n\n$ billion\n\nImport cover\n\nMonths\n9\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.27.3  Fiscal indicators\n\nConsolidated government expenditure \nand net lending\nConsolidated government revenue \nincluding grants\nOverall budget balance\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n% of GDP\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n\n35\n\n28\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n3.27.4  Inflation\n\nInflation\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n 10 \n\n 12 \n 11 \nForecast\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f200    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nand fuel. The domestic price of rice surged in early 2011. A government \ndecision to suspend rice exports in March 2011 is expected to moderate \nprice increases, but much rice is still exported illegally.\n\nThe current account deficit is seen widening to 4.1%\u20134.7% of GDP \n(Figure 3.27.5).

Four new banks and 49 new bank branches \nwere approved in 2010, helping lift private credit significantly. However, \nbanking assets remain low and only about one-third of all private \nfinancing is sourced from the formal sector. Expanding access to formal \nfinance involves allowing state banks to operate on a fully commercial \nbasis, liberalizing interest rates, easing collateral requirements, and \nrelaxing bank deposit-to-capital ratios.\n\nAgricultural credit is inadequate, despite last year\u2019s improvement. \n\nFarmers are often unable to afford sufficient farm inputs and have \nreduced the intensity of land cultivation. Eliminating barriers for private \nbanks to expand in rural areas, introducing crop insurance, and issuing \nland-use certificates to farmers could be useful reforms to expand credit. \nSuch measures could be complemented by public investment in rural \ninfrastructure.\n\nPrivatizing state assets has the potential to encourage private sector \ndevelopment if the outcome leads to greater competition and investment. \nMaking the process more transparent would improve investor confidence \nand asset valuations. Developing the private sector more generally \ndepends on upgrading the regulatory, legal, and policy environment, as \nwell as introducing higher standards of governance.\n\nGas export income adds to foreign exchange reserves, but has little \nimpact on GDP or the budget owing to conversion at the official exchange \nrate. Such income would greatly lift government revenue if it was \nconverted at the market exchange rate, enabling increases in expenditure \non health, education, and infrastructure (social spending as a ratio to \nGDP, at about 1%, is well below that of most developing countries). \n\nFurther in this direction, unifying the multiple exchange rates would \ncreate additional fiscal resources, as would broadening the tax base (with \nfewer tax exemptions), a simplified tax structure, and greater emphasis on \ndirect (rather than indirect) taxes, which are fairer to the poor.\n\n3.27.5  Current account\n\n% of GDP\n8\n\nCurrent account\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n12\n11\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fPhilippines\n\nRobust  private  consumption  alongside  recoveries  in  exports  and  investment  drove  a  vigorous  economic \nrebound in 2010, while inflation remained moderate and the external position strengthened. Yet progress \nremained  slow  in  reducing  poverty  and  generating  jobs.  The  forecast  is  for  solid  economic  growth \nthis  year  and  next,  and  sustained  increases  in  investment  now  appear  achievable\u2014provided  that  the \ngovernment  pushes  through  with  policy  and  governance  reforms.\n\nEconomic performance\nA strong recovery in 2010 lifted GDP by 7.3%, as private consumption \naccelerated and exports and investment rebounded from a slump in \n2009 (Figure 3.28.1). Nearly 60% of total growth came from private \nconsumption, which rose by 5.3%. Remittances from overseas workers \nremained\ta\tkey\tsupport\tto\tconsumption,\tgrowing\tby\t8.2%\tto\t$18.8\tbillion\t\n(the increase in peso terms was 2.4%).\n\nInvestment contributed about 40% of total growth, the highest \nproportion in 10 years. Fixed capital outlays climbed by 17.1%, with \nequipment investment surging by 25.7%. Double-digit growth was \nrecorded for investment in a broad range of equipment, including that \nfor agriculture, construction, mining, metalworking, transport, and \ntelecommunications. Fixed investment as a ratio to GDP edged up to \n15.7%, the strongest rate in 6 years (Figure 3.28.2).\n\nRecovery in exports and robust consumption underpinned this strong \ninvestment, with support from higher corporate earnings and low interest \nrates. Presidential and legislative elections in May 2010 went smoothly, \nand businesses generally were optimistic about the new government\u2019s \ncommitment to improve the business climate. Surveys on business \nexpectations showed steady gains in confidence throughout the year. \nNet exports, which had been a drag on GDP growth during the global \nrecession, also made a positive contribution.\n\nGovernment expenditure rose in the first half, before the new \nadministration reined in some spending in the second half to curb the \nfiscal deficit.\n\nOn the production side, industry was the main contributor to growth \n\n(Figure 3.28.3), overtaking services. Manufacturing output increased \nby 12.3%, after shrinking in 2009. Export-oriented electrical machinery \nmanufacturing shot up by nearly 33%, and industries such as food \nprocessing, petroleum products, and textiles recorded significant output \ngains. Construction activity rose by 10.5%, driven by strong demand for \noffice space, particularly from the business process outsourcing subsector, \nand for housing. Low interest rates also stimulated construction.\n\nThis chapter was written by Teresa Mendoza and Norio Usui of the Philippines Country \nOffice, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.28.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nInvestment\nNet exports\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nStatistical discrepancy\n\n5.3\n\n7.1\n\nPercentage points\n14\n\n1.1\n\n7.3\n\n3.7\n\n09\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; National \nStatistical Coordination Board. http://www.nscb.gov.ph \n(accessed 1 February 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n10\n\n3.28.2  Gross fixed capital formation\n\n7\n\n0\n\n-7\n\n% of GDP\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n03\n\n07\n\n02\n\n01\n\n06\n\n04\n\n2000\n\n05\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; National \nStatistical Coordination Board. http://www.nscb.gov.ph \n(accessed 1 February 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n08\n\n10\n\n09\n\nGross fixed capital formation\n\n\f202    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nServices, still the biggest sector and generating about half GDP and \n\nemployment, grew by 7.1% last year. Much of the growth came from \nretailing, which is bolstered by remittance inflows. Other high-growth \ncomponents were business process outsourcing, finance, and real estate.\nDry weather caused by an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern cut agricultural \noutput, however, by 0.5%, a second consecutive year of weak performance \n(production was flat in 2009 mainly owing to severe tropical storms). \nAgriculture\u2019s share of GDP fell to just under 17%, although the sector still \naccounts for about a third of employment.\n\nThe strong economic rebound did not spark inflation (Figure 3.28.4): \nconsumer prices rose by an average of 3.8%, within the 3.5%\u20135.5% target \nrange set by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central bank. Higher global \noil prices pushed up transport costs (although an appreciating peso \nhelped to damp imported price pressures) and electricity costs rose as \nthe dry weather limited output from hydropower plants. Food price rises \nwere relatively subdued, in part because rice imports countered local \nproduction shortfalls caused by the bad weather.\n\nWith moderate inflation, the central bank kept policy interest rates \nin 2010 at the low levels it set during the global downturn\u2014the overnight \nborrowing rate at 4.0% and the overnight lending rate at 6.0%. Pressures \nto raise rates to more normal levels as the economy rebounded were \nlessened by the appreciation of the exchange rate and the fact that real \npolicy rates remained positive. The central bank did, however, withdraw \nsome of the liquidity-enhancing measures that it took during the \nrecession.

The strong current account and capital \ninflows also drove a 5% appreciation of the peso against the US dollar \nin 2010. To temper gains, the central bank approved higher ceilings on \nforeign exchange purchases such as those for outward investment and \nimport payments, and it encouraged the public and private sectors to \nprepay foreign currency\u2013denominated debt.\n\nSuccessful issuance of sovereign bonds eased concerns about financing \n\nthe fiscal deficit. The government sold its first issue of peso-denominated \nglobal bonds in September 2010, and followed up with another large \nissue\t(equivalent\tto\t$1.25\tbillion\tof\t25-year\tbonds\tpriced\tto\tyield\t6.25%)\tin\t\nJanuary 2011.

These issues \nwere heavily oversubscribed.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe outlook for this year and next assumes that the government follows \nthrough on its commitments to improve the fiscal position, governance, \nand the business environment, and that some of its planned public\u2013\nprivate partnership projects start in the forecast period.\n\nOn fiscal policy, the government pulled back the deficit in 2010 to \n\n3.7% of GDP from 3.9% in 2009. It trimmed noninterest expenditure \nin the second half by 0.4% year on year, after 15.8% growth in the first \nhalf (Figure 3.28.7). It also showed some progress in strengthening tax \ncollection: tax revenue for the year rose by 11%, but was still short of \ntarget.\n\nFiscal policy will likely be less stimulative to the economy in 2011, \n\ngiven that the authorities aim to reduce the deficit to 3.2% of GDP \n(Figure 3.28.8). The budget approved in December 2010 restrains growth in \npublic spending, but also puts greater emphasis on social services such as \nconditional cash transfers to the poor. It reduces infrastructure spending \nas the government looks to the private sector to play a greater role.\nFive initial infrastructure projects (including construction of \n\nexpressways and the privatization of light railway operations in Manila) \nare to be put out for bidding by midyear under public\u2013private partnership \narrangements.\n\nThe forecasts assume that monetary policy will be tightened gradually, \n\ncontinuing the first step made in March 2011 when the central bank \nraised the policy rates by 25 basis points to 4.25% for the overnight \nborrowing rate and to 6.25% for the overnight lending rate. They also \nassume that political uncertainties and natural disasters in countries \nthat host many Filipino workers do not seriously hurt remittance \ninflows (about 16% comes from the Middle East and around 5% from \nJapan\u2014Figure 3.28.9).\n\nSustained business optimism points to further growth in private \ninvestment.

Investment pledges reported by government agencies \nrose by 73% in 2010, mainly for manufacturing, utilities, and real estate. \nCapacity utilization in some manufacturing industries is at high levels, \nwhich is conducive to investment.\n\nUpgrades by credit rating agencies support the investment \nenvironment. Standard & Poor\u2019s raised the Philippines\u2019 long-term \nforeign currency debt rating in November 2010 to BB, or two notches \nbelow investment grade, at par with Fitch\u2019s. Moody\u2019s, which rates the \nPhilippines Ba3, in January 2011 lifted its outlook on the country\u2019s \nforeign- and local-currency bonds to positive, from stable, citing the \nstronger external position, well-managed inflation expectations, and \nimproved prospects of economic reform.\n\nOn the supply side, services will benefit from growth in private \nconsumption and investment. Manufacturing will get support from \nincreased domestic and export demand, though its growth will decelerate \nafter last year\u2019s strong bounce. Private construction is seen remaining \nhealthy because of sustained demand for office space and housing. \nAgriculture is projected to recover from last year\u2019s contraction, but a La \nNi\u00f1a weather pattern evident early in 2011 could bring heavier rainfall \nthan usual for part of this year.\n\nTaking into account these factors and the base effect of the strong \nrecovery in 2010, GDP growth is projected at 5.0% in 2011, quickening to \n5.3% in 2012 (Figure 3.28.11) on the assumption that good progress is made \non starting some public\u2013private projects.\n\nInflation is forecast to rise to 4.9% in 2011 (it was 3.9% in the first \n2 months). This projection reflects, besides higher prices for imported \noil, hikes for utility charges and public transport fares. Higher global \nfood prices will also put upward pressure on inflation, although this is \ncushioned by rice inventories and expectations of an improved harvest. \nOn the basis of a deceleration in global commodity prices, inflation in \n2012 is forecast to ease to 4.3% (Figure 3.28.12).\n\nGrowth in merchandise exports is seen pulling back from last year\u2019s \nlevels to about 11% in the forecast period. Imports will likely grow slightly \nfaster than that on the back of the projected growth in consumer demand \nand investment, as well as higher oil and commodity prices. The trade \ndeficit is set to widen, but the services account will remain in surplus, \nlargely because of growth in business process outsourcing. Remittances \nwill remain a significant contributor to current account surpluses, \nwhich are forecast at about 4% of GDP during the forecast period \n(Figure 3.28.13).\n\nto 55.4% of GDP in 2010) the government has committed to reduce \nthe budget deficit to 2.0% of GDP by 2013 and the debt to 47% of GDP \nby 2016. The focus on the revenue side of the budget is to raise the \ntax-to-GDP ratio from 12.8% in 2010 to 16%\u201318% over several years, \nthrough (at least for now) tighter tax administration and reforms to excise \ntax and investment incentives, rather than increases in tax rates. \n\nFor spending, the plan is to weed out programs that are no longer \n\nrelevant or efficient and to strengthen the finances of government-\ncontrolled corporations. The government is also pushing for a fiscal \nresponsibility law, under which proposals to grant fiscal incentives or \n\n3.28.9  Remittances by region, 2010\n\nUnited States\nEurope\nMiddle East\nOther Americas\n\nOther Asia\nJapan\nOceania\nAfrica\n\n15.8\n\n0.2\n\n7.9\n\n4.7\n\n17.0\n\n1.3\n\n11.3\n\n41.9\n\n%\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.28.10  Business expectations index \n\n04\n\n07\n\n05\n\n02\n\n09\n\n08\n\n03\n\n06\n2001\nNotes: Represents index for the next quarter. 2001 data is \nfor June.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n10\n\n3.28.11  GDP growth\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; National \nStatistical Coordination Board. http://www.nscb.gov.ph \n(accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n12\n11\nForecast\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; National \nStatistical Coordination Board. http://www.nscb.gov.ph \n(accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nIn the context of still high national government debt (equivalent \n\n3.28.12  Inflation\n\nBusiness expectations index\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nPhilippines    205\n\npermanent increases in national government expenditure would require \nsupporting revenue-raising measures or offsetting spending cuts.\n\nRisks to the growth and inflation forecasts on the downside are \nglobal economic growth that is weaker than expected, interruptions to \nremittance inflows, and higher than forecast increases in global oil and \nfood prices. There is a risk that the disruption to supply chains after \nthe Japanese earthquake could dent manufacturing production and \nexports in 2011. Electronics and semiconductors, major export industries \nin the Philippines, depend heavily on components from Japan. Lack \nof progress in the public\u2013private partnership program or in efforts to \nimprove governance and public finances would likely undermine business \nconfidence. A severe La Ni\u00f1a could delay agriculture\u2019s recovery.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nLackluster growth in employment is a chronic problem. Despite strong \neconomic growth last year, the unemployment rate fell only slightly to \n7.3% (Figure 3.28.14). Young people aged 15\u201324 account for about half the \nunemployed. The underemployment rate also remained high at about \n20%. The proportion of workers classified as vulnerable\u2014unpaid family \nmembers and the self-employed, most of whom are in the informal \nsector\u2014has declined since 2006, but remains high at nearly 42%. \nMoreover, the lack of jobs drives large numbers of Filipinos to work \nabroad.\n\nWeak employment generation and low productivity equate with slow \nreductions in poverty. The number of people living in poverty increased \nby 3.3 million to 23.1 million in the 6 years to 2009, when the incidence \nof poverty rose to 26.5% from 24.9%. Progress has been slower than \nhoped for on the Millennium Development Goals relating to poverty, \nmaternal health, and primary education.\n\nMuch remains to be done to improve the business environment so \nthat private investment and employment grow consistently. According \nto the World Economic Forum, the global competitiveness ranking of \nthe Philippines in 2010/11 was 85 (out of 139 countries), compared with \nMalaysia (26), Thailand (38), Indonesia (44), and Viet Nam (59). Investors \ncited concerns such as poor infrastructure and policy instability. \nThe World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2011 report also showed the \nPhilippines below these countries, ranked 148 out of 183, and slipping \nfrom the previous year\u2019s 146. Transparency International\u2019s 2010 \nCorruption Perceptions Index had the Philippines scoring just 2.4 out of \n10 (Figure 3.28.15), where zero represents highly corrupt. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, one key policy challenge is for the \ngovernment to sustain the higher level of investor confidence built \nup last year by pushing ahead with policy and governance reforms. \nAnother is to raise state revenue so as to fund the social development \nand infrastructure programs required to reduce poverty and underpin a \nstronger private sector.\n\n3.28.13  Current account\n\n% of GDP\n6\n\nCurrent account\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nIndex\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; National \nStatistical Coordination Board. http://www.nscb.gov.ph \n(accessed 26 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.28.14  Labor indicators\n\nUnemployment\n\nVulnerable workers\nUnderemployment\n\n%\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.28.15  Transparency International\u2019s \nCorruption Perceptions index \n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n03\n\n05\n\n07\n\n09\n\nNote: The index focuses on corruption in the public sector. \nIt ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 the most corrupt.\nSource: Transparency International. http://www.\ntransparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices\nClick here for figure data\n\nCorruption perception index\n\n\fSingapore\n\nThe economy recovered to grow at a blistering pace in 2010. A rebound in exports revived manufacturing, \ninvestment,  and  private  consumption.  Inflation  increased,  mainly  owing  to  higher  costs  for  transport, \nhousing,  and  food,  and  it  will  quicken  through  the  first  half  of  2011.  GDP  growth  will  moderate  this  year \nand  next.  With  the  strong  rebound  bringing  the  economy  back  to  its  potential  output,  an  immediate \nchallenge  is  to  expand  production  capacity.\n\nEconomic performance\nThis open economy rebounded to the scorching pace of 14.5% in 2010. \nExport-oriented manufacturing and financial services rode the global \nrecovery in trade and investment. Growth was particularly strong in the \nfirst half of 2010, given the low base set by the contraction a year earlier \n(Figure 3.29.1).\n\nExports of goods and services in real terms grew by 19.2%, driven by \nchemicals and electronic components and parts. Imports rose by 16.6%, \nwith sharp increases in imports of raw and intermediate materials and \ncapital goods. Net exports of goods and services rose by 38% to contribute \nthe bulk of total GDP growth (10.5 percentage points).\n\nThe impact of rebounding external trade and manufacturing spilled \n\nover into private consumption and investment. Private consumption \nincreased by 4.2% in 2010, adding 1.6 percentage points to total growth. \nA stronger labor market lifted employment and wages. Visitor arrivals \njumped by 20.2%, helping to fuel a 7.1% rise in retail sales in real terms.\nFixed investment increased by 5.1%, adding 1.4 percentage points \nto GDP growth. That reflected public and private sector investment \nin buildings as well as business investment in machinery, equipment, \nand software. Government consumption rose by 11.0%, accounting for \n1.2 percentage points of the GDP growth, largely on increased social \nspending in education, health, and public housing.\n\nOn the production side, the more export-oriented sectors saw the \n\nfastest growth. Manufacturing accounted for nearly half the GDP \ngrowth, after contracting in 2008\u20132009 (Figure 3.29.2). Precision \nengineering and electronics posted gains of 40% and 35%, respectively, \non the back of revitalized export demand for semiconductor-related \nequipment and consumer electronics. The biggest surge was in biomedical \nmanufacturing, which jumped by 50% owing to higher production of \npharmaceutical ingredients and a more diverse production mix. Growth \nin overall manufacturing peaked at 41.5% in June 2010, on a 6-month \nmoving average basis (Figure 3.29.3).\n\nResumption of growth in consumer spending boosted wholesale and \n\nThis chapter was written by Arief Ramayandi and Aleli Rosario of the Economics and \nResearch Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.29.1  GDP and net export growth\n\nExport growth, year on year  \nGDP growth, year on year \nGDP growth, quarter on quarter \n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2008\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ4\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n3.29.2  Contributions to growth (supply), \nselected sectors\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nManufacturing\n\nWholesale and retail\n\nFinancial services\n\nBusiness services\n\nTransport and storage\n\nConstruction\n\nHotels and restaurants\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nPercentage points\n\nSource: Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry. 2010. \nEconomic Survey of Singapore. http.//www.singstat.gov.sg\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nSingapore    207\n\nretail trading, which grew by 15% and contributed 2.4 percentage points \nto GDP growth. Significant gains were seen in sales of such items as \nhousehold furnishings, clothing, and footwear (Figure 3.29.4). Financial \nservices accelerated by 12.2% in 2010, accounting for 1.5 percentage points \nof GDP growth, because of increased nonbank and business lending and \nexpansion by investment banks.\n\nGrowth in construction moderated to 6.1% in 2010 from 17.0% in the \n\nprevious year, as some major public projects were completed. Private \nconstruction picked up for housing (due to rising house prices) and for \ncommercial and industrial buildings (benefiting from the economic \nrecovery). Construction contracts awarded to private-sector firms doubled \nin\tvalue\tin\t2010,\tto\tUS$14\tbillion.\t\n\nServices, accounting for 70% of total employment, generated nearly \nall the new jobs last year. The number of people employed rose by 112,500 \nto 3.1 million. The overall unemployment rate, including foreign workers, \ndeclined to 2.2% (3.1% for citizens and permanent residents).\n\nThe rapidly expanding domestic and external demand was \n\naccompanied by a rise in inflation to 4.6% by year-end (Figure 3.29.5); \ninflation averaged 2.8% in 2010. Major causes were an increase in the cost \nof automobile certificates of entitlement and rising prices for housing, \nwhich contributed to higher accommodation costs. Food prices also \nstarted to pick up from about April 2010, and by year-end contributed \nabout one-tenth of overall inflation.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) tightened its policy \nstance as recovery took hold and inflation picked up. The MAS sets policy \nby managing the Singapore dollar in a band against a basket of currencies \nby changing the midpoint, slope, or width of the band. In April 2010 it \nrecentered the band, providing more room for the Singapore dollar to \nappreciate. Later in the year, as the labor market tightened and capacity \nutilization rose, the MAS steepened and widened the band, allowing for \nstill further appreciation. During 2010, the currency appreciated by 6.8% \nagainst the US dollar. Liquidity in the economy remained high, and broad \nmoney grew by 8.6%.\n\nIn the external accounts, a 31.1% rise in merchandise exports in 2010 \noutpaced a 27.6% increase in merchandise imports (both in US dollars), \nand\tthe\ttrade\tsurplus\trose\tto\tUS$46.6\tbillion.\tTogether\twith\tthe\texternal\t\nbalances for services and income, the current account surplus climbed to \nthe equivalent of 22.2% of GDP. International reserves rose by about 20% \nto\tUS$225.7\tbillion\t(cover\tfor\t6.6\tmonths\tof\tgoods\tand\tservices\timports).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGlobal economic growth, in particular projected strong expansion in \nmuch of Asia, lays the ground for solid growth in Singapore this year and \nnext. However, growth in net exports will moderate substantially in 2011 \ndue to base effects and higher imports to support investment. \n\nExpected growth of manufacturing suggests that industries, including \n\nelectronics and biomedical, will need to invest in capacity expansion. \nInvestment will remain strong in construction, given solid demand for \nresidential and commercial buildings and extension of the mass transit \nrail system. \n\n3.29.3  Manufacturing growth, 6-month \nmoving average\n\nMonth on month\nExcluding biomedical, \nmonth on month\n\nYear on year\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nOct\n\n Apr\n\n Apr\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\nSource: Singapore Economic Development Board.

Further growth in incomes and the upward trend in visitor \narrivals will continue to stimulate growth in retail sales this year. \n\nMonetary policy is expected to tighten further. Strong recovery in \n2010 put the economy back on, if not above, its potential output, so that \nfurther growth this year is likely to exert pressure on inflation. The \nmonetary authorities will likely consider steepening the slope of the \ncurrency\u2019s trading band, giving more room for it to appreciate. \n\nFiscal policy, in contrast, is likely to have a neutral impact on the \neconomy. Operating expenditure in FY2011 (ending 31 March 2012) has \nbeen increased to support social spending in education, health, and public \nhousing. Growth in development expenditure is budgeted to decelerate, \nsince some transport projects have been completed. The government is \nmaking a cash transfer to citizens this year, but the amount is relatively \nsmall.\n\nOnce these strands are woven, the economy is forecast to grow by \n\n5.5% in 2011, with the potential to surprise on the upside (if a better \nthan expected performance by industrial economies and Asian trading \npartners materializes). In 2012, growth is forecast to moderate further to \n4.8% (Figure 3.29.6) as the economy returns to its long-run trajectory.\n\nInflation quickened to 5.5% in January 2011, driven by rising costs of \n\ntransport and housing (Figure 3.29.7). It is seen staying relatively high \nthrough the first half of 2011 before moderating. Year-average inflation is \nput at 3.2%, easing in 2012 as the rate of cost increases of imported food \nand fuel decelerates.\n\nGrowth in merchandise exports is forecast to slow to 13% in nominal \nterms this year and imports to just below 17%. (Exports increased by 17% \nyear on year in January 2011.) The current account surplus as a share of \nGDP is expected to decline to about 19% in the forecast period, reflecting \nthe impact on trade of higher prices for imported fuel and food, imports \nof capital equipment, and the firmer Singapore dollar.\n\nRisks are both on the down- and upside. As well as the tight domestic \n\nlabor market that could retard expansion in some industries this year, \nhigher than assumed global commodity prices would hurt manufacturing \nindustry, as would weaker than projected global trade. The impact \non supply chains from the March earthquake in Japan is unclear, but \nSingapore\u2019s direct trade with that country is now low (as a proportion of \ntotal trade, exports to Japan averaged 5.8% in the past decade, down from \n7.4% in the 1990s, while imports declined to an average of 10.5% from 18.0%).\nOn the upside, a better performance by industrial economies and \nSingapore\u2019s Asian trading partners would likely have a significant impact \non this open economy.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nExpanding the economy\u2019s capacity is an immediate imperative.

The government\u2019s strategy, laid out in 2010, is to pursue \npolicies that raise productivity by 2%\u20133% a year over the next 10 years, \nmore than double the rate of increase in the past decade. \n\nBy making low-skilled foreign labor more costly\u2014it is increasing \n\nlevies on companies that employ foreign, low-skilled workers\u2014the \ngovernment is encouraging employers to focus on improving productivity.  \nThis year\u2019s budget reiterates the government\u2019s 2010 commitment to \nprovide incentives for firms to automate operations and invest in skills \ndevelopment.\n\nDiscouraging the use of foreign workers in less productive tasks, \nat a time of strong economic growth, has tightened the labor market \nand raised operating costs, particularly for small and medium-sized \nbusinesses that employ cheap foreign labor. But as there will be a lag \nbefore the productivity gains feed through, measures may be needed to \nsoften the policy\u2019s impact on firms during that period.\n\nSingapore\u2019s aging population is another challenge. The old-age \n\nsupport ratio (the number of people 15\u201364 years relative to those 65 years \nand over) has declined from 10.1 in 1999 to 8.3 in 2009. Economic and \nsocial development has been associated with a decline in the fertility rate \nof residents. From 1.5 in 1999\u2014already well below the replacement rate\u2014it \nfell to 1.2 in 2009 (Figure 3.29.8).\n\nTo meet the labor requirements of an expanding economy, in past \n\nyears Singapore turned to immigration and recruitment of foreign \nworkers. Concerns about the increasing number of such workers (now \nat least one-third of the labor force) and the aging population have led \nthe government to seek new ways to encourage population growth. The \nNational Population and Talent Division, created in 2010, has been tasked \nwith formulating policies and overseeing population programs to achieve \na sustainable and integrated population.\n\nSharp increases in prices of housing last year (about 14% for public \nand nearly double that for private housing) prompted the government \nto act several times to curb speculative demand. It introduced a seller\u2019s \nstamp duty, paid if a property is resold within 1 year (as prices continued \nto rise it extended this period to 4 years and raised the rate of stamp \nduty); increased minimum downpayments; and lowered loan-to-value \nratios. On the supply side, it accelerated its release of land for both public \nand private housing. \n\n\fThailand\n\nVigorous  growth  in  private  consumption  and  investment  contributed  to  a  strong  economic  recovery  in \n2010,  though  growth  will  moderate  this  year  and  next,  reflecting  more  subdued  external  demand  and  a \nbase effect. Inflation is forecast to be higher this year, prompting the central bank to maintain a tightening \nmonetary  stance.  In  the  social  arena,  the  government  is  drawing  up  programs  to  address  differences  of \nincome  and  opportunity,  including  a  stronger  social  safety  net  and  investment  in  transport  infrastructure.\n\nEconomic performance\nA strong recovery from a contraction in 2009 propelled GDP growth \nto 7.8% in 2010. Rebounding demand for exports spurred a pickup in \nmanufacturing and bolstered both consumer and business confidence. \nPolitical tensions that led to 7 weeks of violent demonstrations in central \nBangkok during April and May 2010 had a limited and temporary impact \non economic recovery.\n\nThe biggest contributor on the demand side came from a bounce \n\nin investment, which added 5.2 percentage points of GDP growth \n(Figure 3.30.1). Investment had slumped in 2009 and been slack for \nseveral years before that. \n\nPrivate fixed investment grew by 13.8% in 2010, mainly in export-\noriented manufacturing. As export orders picked up, higher capacity \nutilization in industries such as automobiles and electrical machinery \nprompted investment in new equipment, which rose by 14.7% for the year. \nPrivate construction expanded by 10.6%, supported by low interest rates.\nPrivate consumption, which had also declined in 2009, rose by 4.8% \n\nlast year and contributed 2.5 percentage points to GDP growth. Its rise \nwas assisted by a strengthening of the labor market and higher farm \nincomes, owing to increases in prices for agricultural commodities. \nConsumer sentiment weakened in the second quarter when the violence \nbroke out, but it recovered after that.\n\nPublic consumption spending also contributed to economic growth \n\nas the government continued to disburse the fiscal stimulus measures \ninitiated in 2009.\n\nPublic fixed investment in 2010 was slightly below prior-year levels. \nLower investment from the budget and by state-owned companies was \npartly offset by outlays on the Thai Khem Kaeng (Strong Thailand) \ninfrastructure program. This program, involving projects that could \ncost\tmore\tthan\t$40\tbillion\tover\t3\tyears,\tstarted\tin\tOctober\t2009.\tOf\t\nB350\tbillion\t($10.2\tbillion)\tbudgeted\tto\tbe\tspent\ton\tinfrastructure\tlast\t\nyear, about 74% was disbursed, after some delays during the political \nunrest in the first half.\n\nThis chapter was written by Luxmon Attapich of the Thailand Resident Mission, ADB, \nBangkok.\n\n3.30.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nTotal investment\nNet exports\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nStatistical discrepancy\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.8\n\n5.1\n\n5.0\n\n2.5\n\n-2.3\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSource: National Economic and Social Development Board. \nhttp://www.nesdb.go.th (accessed 11 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n09\n\n10\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand    211\n\nOn the supply side, industry generated most of the GDP growth. \n\nManufacturing production surged by about 20% in the first half, then \nmoderated to 8% growth in the second because of a base effect and softer \nglobal demand. Automobile production jumped by about 60% owing \nto a rebound in both domestic and export demand. Manufacturing \ncontributed 5.4 percentage points of GDP growth, and industry as a whole \nadded 6.0 percentage points.\n\nServices contributed about 2 percentage points to total growth. Hotel \n\nand restaurant services expanded by 8.4%, supported by a pickup in \ntourism in the second half (arrivals had fallen during the protests in the \ncapital\u2014Figure 3.30.2). Tourist arrivals for the full year rose by 11.7% from \n2009. Financial services grew by 8%, in line with expansion of business \nand consumer credit.\n\nAgriculture, though, had another bad year because of drought, \nfollowed by floods. The sector contracted by 2.2%. Production fell for \ncassava, corn, fruit, palm oil, sugarcane, and rice.\n\nInterruptions to food supplies caused by the bad weather added to \ninflation pressures induced by rising global prices for commodities and \noil and stronger domestic demand. The consumer price index rose by \n3.2% on average in 2010, after a period of deflation in 2009 (Figure 3.30.3). \nA 9.6% appreciation of the baht against the US dollar last year helped to \ntemper the impact of rising import prices.\n\nAs economic recovery gained traction and the political situation \n\nsettled in the second half of 2010, the Bank of Thailand started to \nnormalize its policy interest rate (it had lowered the rate by 250 basis \npoints to 1.25% during the global crisis). The central bank raised the rate \nfive times between July 2010 and March 2011 (Figure 3.30.4) to 2.5% (still \nbelow the inflation rate).\n\nLending by commercial banks increased by 11.3% in 2010 (it had \n\ncontracted by 1.8% in 2009), as business and consumer confidence \nimproved, banks became more confident about the economy, and interest \nrates remained relatively low.\n\nExternal trade rebounded (Figure 3.30.5). Merchandise exports rose \n\nby\t28.5%\tto\t$193.7\tbillion,\treflecting\tstrong\texternal\tdemand\tfor\tboth\t\nagricultural and manufactured goods. Shipments of manufactured items, \nincluding autos and components, computers, electrical appliances, and \nmachinery, rose by about 31%, agricultural products by 36%.\n\nBy destination, exports to the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and \nSoutheast Asia all jumped by about 35%, while those to major industrial \neconomies (the European Union, Japan, and the United States) together \nrose by nearly 24%.\n\nRecovery in domestic and external demand caused a near 37% \nsurge\tin\timports\tto\t$179.6\tbillion\tin\t2010.\tImports\tof\traw\tmaterials\tand\t\nintermediate goods needed for export-oriented industries shot up by 42%, \nand the recovery in investment drove a 27.7% rise in imports of capital \ngoods.

Reserves were equivalent to 9.5 months of imports of goods \nand services.\n\nThe government trimmed its budget expenditure in FY2010 (ending \n30 September 2010) although total public spending increased, taking into \naccount both on-budget and off-budget spending under the Thai Khem \nKaeng program. Revenue collection was stronger than expected and \nexceeded the target by 10%, reining in the fiscal deficit to 2.1% of GDP \nfrom 4.8% in FY2009.\n\nPublic debt as a ratio to GDP fell to 42.5% at end-2010 from 43.9% in \n\n2009, mainly the result of the larger GDP in 2010.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe government has indicated that national elections will be held in June \n2011. Forecasts assume that the elections go smoothly and there are no \nserious disruptions that affect the economy.\n\nLast year\u2019s strong rebound in GDP came from a low base brought \nabout by the economic contraction in 2009. Consequently, economic \ngrowth will moderate considerably in 2011. Moreover, expected slower \ngrowth in major trading partners\u2014the PRC, Southeast Asian neighbors, \nand major industrial countries\u2014will damp the expansion in Thailand, as \nwill the substantially higher cost of imported oil.\n\nMerchandise exports are projected to increase by about 13% in \n\nnominal terms this year, less than half the rebound pace of 2010.\n\nPrivate fixed investment is seen growing by about 9% in real terms, \nalso below last year\u2019s pace. Capacity utilization rates suggest that some \nmanufacturers will need to expand facilities to accommodate expected \nincreases in domestic and external demand. Appreciation of the exchange \nrate has lowered the cost of imported machinery and equipment. \nAdditionally, relatively low interest rates are conducive for investment.\nAn index of business sentiment in January 2011 indicated that \nbusiness managers were confident about the outlook for orders and \nproduction, although they were concerned about rising costs.\n\nPrivate consumption is forecast to grow by about 4% in real terms, \ndue to growth in incomes. That marks a deceleration from 2010 but would \nstill make a solid contribution to GDP growth. The labor market has \ntightened (businesses complain that they face difficulties in recruiting \nboth skilled and unskilled labor), so that wages will likely increase. \n\nFurther, the government has said that it plans to raise minimum \nwages by 25% over 2 years if reelected, which would be on top of an \nincrease in minimum wages in late 2010. Most government employees \nreceived a 5% wage increase from April 2011. Rural incomes are benefiting \nfrom high prices for many agricultural commodities.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand    213\n\nA new round of concessions for low-income households will also \n\n3.30.6  Confidence indicators\n\nBusiness sentiment\n\nConsumer confidence\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2006\n\nJan\n07\n\nJul\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\n \n\nFeb\n11\n\nNote: A reading of less than 50 for business sentiment \nand less than 100 for consumer confidence denotes a \ndeterioration.\nSources: Center for Economic and Business Forecasting; \nBank of Thailand, http://www.bot.or.th (both accessed \n28 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.30.7  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\nIndex\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n12\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.30.8  Annual inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\nAnnual inflation\n\nGDP growth\n\nsupport consumption. The government unveiled in January 2011 a \npackage of \u201cnew year\u2019s gifts\u201d that included subsidies on cooking gas, \ndiesel fuel, electricity, and public transport. The authorities have extended \nprice controls on a range of food staples and animal feeds and directed \nstate\tbanks\tto\tset\taside\tB5\tbillion\t($166\tmillion)\tfor\tlow-interest\tloans\tto\t\ntaxi drivers and street vendors, who might otherwise find it difficult to \nborrow because they are not salary earners and do not have collateral. \nUnsurprisingly, consumer confidence is buoyant (Figure 3.30.6).\n\nWhile fiscal policy is expected to be mildly expansionary in the \nforecast period, monetary policy seems set to continue tightening. The \ngovernment has budgeted to increase spending in FY2011 by about 22%, \nand widened the deficit target to 4% of GDP. Budget disbursements in \nthe fiscal first quarter exceeded the target for that period. The rest of the \nThai Khem Kaeng program will be funded through the budget, rather \nthan mainly by off-budget expenditure as was the case last fiscal year. The \nfiscal deficit is expected to narrow to 3.2% in FY2012.\n\nThe Bank of Thailand is likely to gradually raise interest rates \nfurther during the forecast period and it will probably allow a gradual \nappreciation of the baht to help keep imported inflation in check.\n\nTaking into account the outlook for domestic and external demand, \nthe base effect, and the policy stance, GDP is forecast to grow by 4.5% in \n2011 and 4.8% in 2012 (Figure 3.30.7).\n\nInflation was 3.0% in the first 2 months of 2011. Domestic food prices \n\nclimbed, partly a result of bad weather. Higher global food and oil \nprices are adding to price pressures, but the subsidies and price controls \nshould alleviate the impact of inflation on low-income households. For \nall 2011, inflation is forecast at 3.5% (Figure 3.30.8). It will ease next year, \nif global food and oil prices decelerate and the policy stance tightens as \nanticipated.\n\nVolatile capital inflows are expected to ease this year. To manage the \n\nflows the central bank is likely to focus on relaxing rules for overseas \ninvestment and hedging by domestic businesses, rather than on controls \non inflows.\n\nHigher prices for imported commodities and oil will likely mean \nthat merchandise imports outpace exports in the forecast period. The \ntrade surplus will decline slightly and the current account surplus is seen \nsubsiding to about 2.0% of GDP in 2011 and 1.0% in 2012. Tourism, an \nimportant contributor to the surplus in services trade, got off to a good \nstart in January 2011, when arrivals rose by 11.6% from the prior-year \nperiod.\n\nDomestic risks to the outlook center on political uncertainty, which \ncan have an impact on business and consumer confidence, and further \nbouts of bad weather (the south of the country saw extensive flooding in \nMarch 2011), which may reduce economic growth.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nPolitical unrest over recent years, culminating in last year\u2019s violent \ndemonstrations, has brought into focus gaps in incomes and \nopportunities in Thailand. The richest 20% of households account for \n\n\f214    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nnearly half of total household incomes and the Gini coefficient, a measure \nof income inequality, for the country is high at 0.51 (where 0 is perfect \nequality and 1 is absolute inequality).\n\nTackling regional inequality, the government is ramping up \ninvestment in transport infrastructure (roads, rail, and ports), which \nshould encourage businesses to expand and generate employment outside \nthe Bangkok area in the longer term. Faster decentralization should be \nused alongside this investment boost, giving local governments greater \nauthority to make decisions over infrastructure and services to attract \ndevelopment to their areas as well as the fiscal resources to support \nthis responsibility. (A decentralization act was passed in 1999, but \nimplementation has lagged.)\n\nAnother government approach to mitigating inequality is to build a \nstronger social safety net. The draft 11th National Plan (2012\u20132016), to be \nfinalized this year, includes a strategy to create a more equitable society. \nBased on this strategy, the government is setting up a voluntary pension \nfund for the informal sector and expanding social security benefits to \npeople in that sector. The challenge is to design and operate programs \nthat are well targeted and fiscally sustainable.\n\nThe cabinet has approved in principle the establishment of a Post \nBank, using the post office network to provide low-interest loans of up to \nB10,000\t($330).\tOther\tmicrofinance\tarrangements\tare\tunder\tconsideration\t\nto assist low-income households.\n\nAdditionally, the government plans to distribute community land-title \n\ndeeds to more than 200,000 landless people and farmers living on plots \nowned by the state.\n\n\fViet Nam\n\nGDP growth quickened in 2010, supported by recovery in exports and an accommodative monetary policy. \nInflation  hit  double-digit  rates  by  year-end,  and  the  currency  slid.  Moving  to  restore  macroeconomic \nstability,  the  authorities  in  February  2011  unveiled  comprehensive  measures  including  tightened  fiscal \nand  monetary  policies.  Partly  as  a  consequence,  economic  growth  is  forecast  to  moderate  this  year,  then \npick up next year. Inflation is seen subsiding late in 2011 and further in 2012. The immediate challenge is \nto  follow  through  on  the  policy  tightening;  the  longer-term  one  is  to  reinvigorate  structural  reforms.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth picked up to 6.8% in 2010 (Figure 3.31.1), supported by recovery \nin the global economy, the residual impact of domestic fiscal stimulus \nin 2009, and an accommodative monetary policy. Strong consumption \ngrowth of 9.7% stimulated private sector investment.\n\nBy sector, industry expanded by 7.7% and contributed 3.2 percentage \n\npoints of total GDP growth. Stronger external demand spurred 8.4% \ngrowth in manufacturing, and public infrastructure investment pushed \nup growth of construction by 10.1%. Services grew by 7.5%, contributing \n3.1 percentage points of GDP growth. Wholesale and retail trading \nclimbed by 8.1%, reflecting the expansion in private consumption, and \nhotels and restaurants picked up by 8.7%, assisted by a steep 34.8% \nincrease in visitor arrivals. Agricultural output was subdued, though, \nedging up by 2.8% in 2010, owing to flooding in central regions followed \nby drought in the north.\n\nFaster economic growth helped to reduce urban unemployment, and \n\npoverty incidence fell to 10.6% from 12.3% in 2009, based on the official \npoverty measure.\n\nInflation accelerated to 11.8% in December 2010, averaging 9.2% for the \nyear, the highest in Southeast Asia. By March 2011, it was running at 13.9% \nyear on year (Figure 3.31.2), with rising food prices and school fees leading \ncauses. Credit grew by 32.4%, above the official target of 25% but slightly \nslower than 39.6% in the previous year.\n\nConcerns among the general population over loss of purchasing \n\npower, together with a slide in the currency\u2014the dong\u2014boosted \npurchases of gold and US dollars. Foreign currency deposits climbed by \n21% in 2010. The currency came under steady depreciation pressure from \nabout midyear, reflected in the spread between the black market rate and \nthe reference rate of the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV, the central bank); \nthe spread increased to over 10% in January 2011. The SBV devalued the \ndong by 9.3% in February 2011, and narrowed the trading band for the \ndollar\u2013dong exchange rate from \u00b13% to \u00b11%.

The SBV started to withdraw monetary stimulus from late \n2009, raising its base rate and ending interest rate subsidies and caps, \nbut in 2010 it urged banks to moderate lending-rate rises. With inflation \naccelerating, the SBV in November 2010 raised policy rates again. That \ntightening seemed insufficient to counter what was by then double-digit \ninflation or market expectations of further dong depreciation.\n\nThe SBV\u2019s capacity to support the dong was constrained by relatively \n\nlow\tholdings\tof\tforeign\texchange\treserves,\testimated\tat\t$12.4\tbillion\tat\t\nend-2010 (about 1.9 months of import cover\u2014Figure 3.31.4).\n\nA rebound in exports last year, reflecting recovery in global trade, \nreined\tin\tthe\tdeficit\tin\tmerchandise\ttrade\tto\t$7.1\tbillion\ton\ta\tbalance-\nof-payments\tbasis,\tfrom\t$8.3\tbillion\tin\t2009.\tExports\trose\tby\t26.4%\tin\t\nUS dollars.

In real terms, government expenditure was estimated to be little \nchanged from 2009, but revenue and grants rose by about 10%, reflecting \nstronger non-oil tax receipts.\n\nTotal public debt and publicly guaranteed debt, excluding state firms\u2019 \ncontingent liabilities, is estimated to have declined by 1 percentage point \nto 51.5% of GDP in 2010, still above the government\u2019s target ceiling of \n50%.

Vinashin will be restructured over 3 years \nto put its finances on a firmer footing. \n\nViet Nam\u2019s ranking in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2011 report \nrose to 78 from 88 the previous year. This reflected significant gains in \nthe ease of starting a business, obtaining construction permits, access to \ncredit, and tax administration. A government drive called Project 30, to \nreduce bureaucratic procedures for business, also helped.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe Socioeconomic Development Strategy for 2011\u20132020, approved by \nthe Communist Party of Viet Nam in January 2011, targets rapid average \nGDP growth of 7%\u20138%.  In February, however, the government indicated \nthat it was prepared to give a higher priority to stability than growth in \nthe near term, when it committed to restore stability through a package \nof policies (Resolution 11\u2014Box 3.31.1), notably tighter fiscal and monetary \npolicies in 2011 aimed at curbing inflation and stabilizing the external \nposition. Restoration of solid investor confidence will require sustained \nand consistent policy actions until inflation is subdued.\n\nThe SBV lifted its refinancing rate from 9.0% to 12.0% and its \nrediscount rate from 7% to 12% in the first quarter of 2011, although it \n\n3.31.1  Resolution 11\n\n3.31.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n6.1\n\n13.3\n\n-3.8\n\n6.7\n\n6.8\n\n-3.6\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nResolution 11, issued on 24 February 2011, contains six \nsets of policy measures to restore macroeconomic stability \nand maintain social security: tightening monetary policy; \ntightening fiscal policy; containing the trade deficit; \nincreasing electricity prices while shielding the poor and \nusing a more market-based mechanism for petroleum \npricing; strengthening social security; and improving \ndissemination of policy information.\n\nOn 1 March 2011, the SBV issued a directive to \nimplement Resolution 11. It included a credit growth \ntarget ceiling of 20% (reduced from an original target of \n23%) and a 15%\u201316% target for growth in M2 money \nsupply in 2011 (down from 21%\u201324%). Both targets are \nconsiderably below the outcomes in 2010, when credit \ngrew by 32.4% and M2 by 33.3%. \n\nTo achieve these targets, the SBV instructed banks and \nother credit institutions to curb credit growth to less than \n20%. These institutions were also instructed to limit credit \noutstanding to \u201cnonproductive\u201d activities such as real \nestate and marketable securities to 22% of total lending by \nend-June 2011 and 16% by end-2011.\n\nThe SBV intends to penalize institutions that fail to \n\nmeet these targets by doubling their required reserve \nratios. It also is restricting foreign currency lending on \nimports of specified nonessential goods, including all \n\nconsumer goods. The SBV aims to limit the import of gold \nto a few firms and to eventually prohibit trading in gold \nbars in the parallel market. These actions are intended to \nreduce speculative foreign exchange and gold transactions \nand so help to stabilize the dong.\n\nOn the fiscal side, the Ministry of Finance revised the \n2011 budget deficit target to below 5.0% of GDP (down \nfrom an original 5.3%). Ministries and line agencies were \ntold to withhold 10% of nonessential current expenditure \n(excluding salaries and wages) for the rest of this year. \nThe budget revenue target for 2011 was revised up \nby 7%\u20138%. The government aims to collect higher taxes \nthrough improved tax administration enforcement. It also \nintends to closely scrutinize all investments made by public \nagencies and state-owned firms.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade is developing a \nplan to contain the trade deficit. It will try to improve the \nefficiency of export production, while restricting certain \nimports.\n\nStrengthening social security involves measures to \nshield vulnerable groups from the impact of the increase \nin electricity tariffs, as well as other targeted support.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Communication has \nbeen directed to disseminate timely information on policy \nactions.\n\n\f218    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nmaintained the base rate at 9.0%, below the inflation rate (Figure 3.31.6). \nThe refinancing rate was further increased to 13.0% on 1 April 2011. The \nhigher rates increased the cost to commercial banks of borrowing dong \nfrom the central bank. The SBV is aiming to balance the need to tighten \npolicy with the likely impact on firms that already face high dong-\ndenominated borrowing rates of close to 20%.\n\nProposed policy actions include both market-based instruments and \n\nadministrative controls. Such controls will likely have some temporary \nimpact, but may not be effective further out. For example, controls on \ngold trading usually lead to increased illicit trading. They also create \nmarket distortions.\n\nThe forecasts assume that the government will follow through with \nthe policy tightening until macroeconomic stability is restored. That will \nslow consumer spending and domestically financed investment.\n\nForecasts also take into account developments in the first quarter \nof 2011. Preliminary data show that GDP rose by 5.4% year on year in \nJanuary\u2013March 2011, slowing from 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010. \nAgriculture increased by 2.0%, industry by 5.5%, and services by 6.3%. \nSolid expansion in the first quarter was seen elsewhere: industrial \nproduction at 14.0%, retail sales at 9% in real terms, international visitor \narrivals at 12%, and merchandise exports on a customs basis at 44%. For \nthe whole year, crude oil production is projected at 15 million metric tons, \nsimilar to 2010.\n\nAgainst this background, GDP is forecast to grow by 6.1% in 2011 \n(Figure 3.31.7). Growth is expected to pick up to 6.7% in 2012 as a more \nstable economic environment stimulates consumption and investment. \nInflation is projected to remain high through 2011, peaking at about \n16% year on year in the third quarter and averaging 13.3% (Figure 3.31.8). \nUnderpinning high inflation (which averaged 10.3% in the first quarter of \nthe year) are a lagged pass-through of currency depreciation and hikes in \nprice-controlled electricity (by 15.3%) and fuel (by about 30%) in March, as \nwell as the base effect of low inflation in April\u2013September 2010. \n\nSustained policy tightening will damp domestic demand and help to \nstabilize the dong exchange rate. Bringing year-on-year inflation down to \nsingle digits by end-2011 will require the average month-on-month rate to \nbe below 0.4% for the rest of the year.\n\nalongside the impact of policy tightening on imports will contribute to \nslower growth in external trade this year. After inflows from tourism and \nremittances, the current account deficit is forecast at 3.8% in 2011 and \n3.6% in 2012 (Figure 3.31.9).\n\nThe more stable macroeconomic situation should stimulate FDI in the \n\nforecast period. The overall balance of payments is expected to improve.\nRisks to the outlook center on implementation of Resolution 11. \nInsufficient policy tightening or premature easing\u2014or perception of \neasing\u2014of policies would keep inflation high for longer and could lead to \na deterioration of the external accounts. Such an outcome could require \nanother round of policy tightening in a year or two. \n\nAnother domestic risk relates to state-owned enterprises. Vinashin \nneeds to negotiate a debt rescheduling. Further evidence of debt distress \namong this or other state-owned firms would hurt investor confidence.\n\n3.31.6  Interest rates\n\nBase rate\n\nRefinancing rate\n\nDiscount rate\n\n% per year\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nMar\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: State Bank of Viet Nam.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.31.7  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\nGDP growth\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n09\n\n08\n\n10\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n12\n11\nForecast\nSources: General Statistics Office of Viet Nam; Asian \nDevelopment Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\nA deceleration in world trade from the rebound rates of 2010 \n\n3.31.8  Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\nInflation\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nViet Nam    219\n\n3.31.9  Current account and  fiscal balance\n\nOverall fiscal deficit\n\nCurrent account deficit\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n12\n11\nForecast\n\nThere is also a risk that the supply of manufactured components from \n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\nThe large increase in the domestic credit stock, of about $100 billion\n\nduring 2007\u20132010, raises concerns over banking asset quality, as does \nbank exposure to real estate and state-owned enterprises.\n\nUS dollar borrowing jumped in early 2010 as borrowers took \n\nadvantage of new regulations that allowed firms earning dong revenue to \nborrow in US dollars (at lower rates than in dong). But such borrowing \ncomes with a currency risk, and after the currency devaluations some \nfirms might now face much bigger debt in dong terms. \n\nJapan for Viet Nam\u2019s export industries, or exports to that market, could \nbe disrupted by the impact of the 11 March earthquake for longer than \ncurrently anticipated.\n\nOverall, though, the change in policies this year has reduced domestic \nrisks. The medium-term outlook remains favorable, with the proviso that \nmacroeconomic stability is restored and maintained. Viet Nam remains \nan attractive destination for foreign investors, and is well positioned to \nbenefit from economic developments in the PRC. Rising labor costs there \nwill divert some FDI to other developing Asian economies, and growing \ndomestic PRC consumption will increase its demand for imports.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nMuch has been achieved in lifting the economy to lower-middle-income \nstatus in 2010 and in reducing poverty over two decades. High inflation, \nespecially for food, puts poverty-reduction gains at risk, however. The \nimmediate challenge is to restore stability in the economy by fully \nimplementing the policy directives of February 2011.\n\nMaintaining price stability and economic growth in the longer term \n\nrequires further improvements in efficiency, particularly in the state-\nowned sector; development of the financial system; and heavy investment \nin infrastructure and education to address supply-side bottlenecks.\n\nState-owned firms are a drag on the economy. They absorb many of \n\nthe available resources but their efficiency is much lower than among \nprivate firms. Hence a better performance from them would stimulate \neconomic growth and release budget resources for more productive uses. \nRegardless of ownership, putting them on a commercial footing, exposing \nthem to competition, and holding them financially accountable\u2014\nparticularly for noncore activities\u2014would improve their efficiency.\n\nFurther reforms are needed to safeguard the financial system (the \nSBV took the important step of raising minimum capital requirements in \n2010). Supervision of banks would be strengthened if the capacity of the \nSBV to provide regulatory oversight were upgraded and if a risk-based \nsupervision framework were adopted (shifting from a compliance-based \napproach). A move toward international standards for bank provisioning \nwould also strengthen banks\u2019 stability.\n\nFinally, timely publication of economic and financial data would help \n\nto build public and investor confidence.  \n\n\f\fTHE PACIFIC\n Fiji \n Papua New Guinea \n Timor-Leste \n\n Cook Islands\n Kiribati\n Marshall Islands\n Federated States of Micronesia\n Nauru\n Palau\n Samoa\n Solomon Islands\n Tonga\n Tuvalu\n Vanuatu\n\n\f\fFiji\n\nAfter  contracting  in  2009  the  economy  achieved  slight  growth  in  2010,  based  largely  on  a  recovery  in \ntourism and some goods exports, though the sugar industry weakened for a fourth consecutive year. Low \nlevels  of  growth  are  forecast  for  2011\u20132012,  accompanied  by  moderate  inflation.  Reforms  to  improve  the \ninvestment  environment  are  key  to  generating  stronger  growth  and  reducing  poverty.\n\nEconomic performance\nMinimal GDP growth of 0.1% in 2010 continued the pattern of \nrecent years\u2014a period of contraction followed by slight growth\u2014leaving \nGDP virtually unchanged since 2005. (Official revisions to GDP estimates \nfor 2006\u20132009, due to rebasing, resulted in growth of 0.2% in 2008 and a \ncontraction of 3.0% in 2009\u2014Figure 3.32.1.)\n\nIn 2010, the impact of growth in tourism, mineral water exports, \nfisheries, and gold mining slightly outweighed downturns in agriculture; \ntransport, storage, and communication; real estate and business services; \nhealth and social work; and other community services (these latter two \non the back of reduced government expenditure).\n\nVisitor arrivals rose by 16.5% to a record 633,000 in 2010 \n\n(Figure 3.32.2). Increases were notable from Australia (helped by its \nbuoyant economy) and from the People\u2019s Republic of China and India \n(reflecting marketing efforts). Despite a 20% devaluation of the Fiji dollar \nin April 2009, price discounting meant that growth in tourism earnings \nonly kept pace with tourist arrivals.\n\nGold production from the Vatukoula mine rose by nearly 80% to \n59,000 grams in the 12 months to August 2010, and is expected to reach \nan annual rate of 100,000 grams in 2011. Mineral water exports recovered \nfrom a downturn during the global recession, and fisheries benefited from \nfavorable weather.\n\nOn the negative side, agriculture suffered from a cyclone in March \n2010, then a drought. The sugar industry, which supports about a quarter \nof the population, has declined in recent years as the European Union \nphased out preferential prices it paid to certain nations, including Fiji. \nThe European Union was to provide assistance to the country\u2019s sugar \nindustry, but postponed the plan after a military coup in 2006.\n\nLast year, the government initiated a sugar industry reform program \n\nthat included funding for new cane planting, but farmers continued to \nleave the industry and cane production fell by 19%. Breakdowns at sugar \nmills caused production of raw sugar to slide by 20.8% (Figure 3.32.3).

Remittances in US dollar terms rose by about 14% \nin the 7 months to July 2010. But investment remained low, reflected \nin a 0.5% fall in imports of investment goods and a 1.1% decline in new \nlending for investment.\n\nInflation accelerated early in 2010, propelled by the impact of the \ndevaluation and then shortages caused by the cyclone, as well as by higher \nglobal oil prices. After peaking at 10.5% year on year in April, it slowed \nas the devaluation effect waned, but then picked up again to 5.0% in \nDecember, after some price controls on food were removed and electricity \ntariffs were put up. For the year, inflation averaged 7.8%.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Fiji absorbed excess liquidity in the banking \nsystem by twice raising the statutory reserve deposit requirement for \ncommercial banks in 2010, to 10.0%. It also implemented an overnight \npolicy interest rate to signal the monetary policy stance. Late in the year it \nlowered that rate to 2.5% from 3.0% and relaxed exchange controls. The Fiji \ndollar firmed against the US dollar (by 4.5%) in 2010 and against the euro, \nbut eased versus the yen and the Australian and New Zealand dollars.\n\nGovernment data indicate that the budget deficit widened from the \n\nequivalent of 3% of GDP in 2009 to 3.6% in 2010 (Figure 3.32.4). Both \nrevenue and expenditure targets were met, although it seems likely that \nsome planned capital expenditure was used for operating expenses. \nPublic debt rose to the equivalent of 58.0% of GDP, or 91.5% of GDP if \ngovernment-guaranteed debt is included (Figure 3.32.5). The government \ntook onto its books the debt of Fiji Sugar Corporation, a reminder of the \nrisks posed by contingent liabilities.\n\nPreliminary official figures indicate that merchandise exports rose by \nabout 25% in 2010, assisted by higher output and prices of gold. Imports \nwere subdued by slack domestic demand. On this basis, the trade and \ncurrent account deficits likely narrowed. Foreign exchange reserves rose \nto\tUS$672\tmillion\t(about\t4\tmonths\tof\timports).\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe outlook in the forecast period depends heavily on prospects for \nthe sugar and tourism industries. Reforms in the sugar industry that \nstarted in 2010 are assumed to make slow progress, in view of capacity \nconstraints in the government and the need to consult many stakeholders.\nVisitor arrivals are influenced by marketing, and while it is assumed \n\nthe government will continue to fund the Fiji Visitors Bureau, several \nother Pacific island economies have stepped up their marketing programs. \nThe outlook also assumes no severe cyclones or other natural disasters.\n\nExpected modest economic growth for many of the country\u2019s trading \n\npartners in 2011 clouds the prospects for both tourism (where deep \ndiscounting is set to continue) and merchandise exports. On the balance \nof these factors, GDP growth is forecast to remain low at 0.5% this year, \npicking up to 0.8% in 2012 if the sugar industry\u2019s reforms gain traction.\nThe 2011 budget targets a deficit of 3.5% of GDP (the same target set \n\nin 2010).

The budget also assumes that GDP growth will \nquicken to 1.3% in 2011. Failure to meet this target would dent projected \nrevenue and probably require spending cuts to be prolonged.\n\nAmple liquidity is expected in the banking system in 2011, but growth \n\nin credit to the private sector will likely remain slow in view of forecast \nlow investment levels. The Reserve Bank of Fiji lowered the overnight \npolicy rate in February 2011, to 2.0% from 2.5%, to support growth in light \nof what it described as \u201cstill very weak domestic economic conditions.\u201d\nInflation rose to 5.9% in January 2011, from 5.0% in December 2010, \nmainly reflecting the increase in the value-added tax and higher global oil \nprices. For this year, inflation is projected to average 4.0% (Figure 3.32.6).\nThe\tgovernment\tplans\tto\troll\tover\ta\tUS$150\tmillion\tsovereign\tbond\t\n\nthat matures in September 2011, which would delay the need to repay \nthe bond (it represents 55% of total public external debt). Last year, the \nauthorities discussed with the International Monetary Fund a possible \nstand-by credit arrangement that would bolster foreign exchange reserves, \ntargeted primarily at debt repayment, but they put the idea of a program \nled by the institution on hold.\n\nImports will increase faster in 2011 than last year, according to official \n\nprojections, while growth in exports will moderate. Foreign exchange \nreserves are likely to come under pressure. \n\nThese forecasts are vulnerable to external risks, including oil prices \n(every\tUS$10\ta\tbarrel\tincrease\tin\toil\tprices\traises\tthe\tcost\tof\toil\timports\t\nby\tabout\tUS$50\tmillion,\tor\t26%\tof\t2010\u2019s\ttotal\timport\tbill)\tand\tweaker\t\nthan anticipated earnings from tourism. Lack of progress on sugar \nreforms poses a domestic risk to the outlook.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nWeakness in investment confines the economy to a low-growth path. \nPublic and private investment combined is estimated to have fallen to 14% \nof GDP in 2010, from an average of 18% in 2000\u20132005. Private investment \nis estimated at the low level of 3% of GDP.\n\nThe return of significant donor assistance for infrastructure and other \nprojects, largely withheld since the 2006 coup, depends on new elections. \nThe government is adamant, however, that it will not call them until 2014.\n\nInvestor concerns include an opaque and uncertain regulatory \nenvironment, as illustrated by foreign exchange controls, price controls, \nand unpredictable policy decisions. For example, a government decree in \n2010 required media organizations to ensure that their directors and 90% \nof the beneficial shareholders are Fijian citizens permanently residing in \nthe country, which forced a divestment by a foreign firm. \n\nDeficiencies in infrastructure and the poor performance of \n\ngovernment-owned enterprises also hurt the investment climate. The need \nto spur growth is pressing in light of rising poverty, estimated to affect \n35%\u201340% of the population. The authorities have provided some targeted \nsocial welfare and have expanded price controls. But the sustainable \nremedy to poverty \u2014job creation\u2014is unlikely without higher rates of \ninvestment.\n\n\fPapua New Guinea\n\nEconomic growth accelerated in 2010 as construction started on the country\u2019s largest resource project and \nincomes  benefited  from  the  recovery  in  global  commodity  prices.  Growth  is  forecast  to  quicken  in  2011, \nunderpinned by investment in resources and gains in production of metals and agricultural commodities. \nReforms  to  public  financial  management  and  the  business  environment  should  be  stepped  up  if  the  full \nbenefits  of  a  coming  surge  in  revenue  from  resources  are  to  be  realized.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe start of construction on a $15 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) \nproject and recovery in global commodity prices benefited this resource-\nrich economy in 2010. GDP growth was estimated at 7.1%, marking almost \na decade of uninterrupted expansion averaging about 4.4%.\n\nIndustry, including minerals, grew by an estimated 9.3% and was \n\nthe major contributor to GDP growth (Figure 3.33.1). This mainly \nreflected a construction boom in Port Moresby and Lae, and an increase \nin mine production, after several years of contraction in mineral \noutput. Services expanded by an estimated 8.5%, with strong growth in \ntelecommunications and transport. Agricultural output rose by 3.5%.\nPrivate consumption was supported by higher incomes, partly \n\nattributable to the recovery in commodity prices (most people are farmers \nwho produce primarily for their own consumption plus some cash crops \nsuch as cocoa, coffee, and copra). \n\nProgress on securing finance for the LNG plant and starting the \nconstruction bolstered private investment and buoyed investor sentiment. \nThe plant is expected to begin production of LNG for export in 2014 or \n2015, and full operating capacity will be 6.6 million tons a year. Strong \ninvestment helped to offset a decrease in government expenditure of 4.1% \nin real terms in 2010.\n\nThe rebound in commodity prices lifted the value of merchandise \nexports in US dollars by about 27% in 2010 (Figure 3.33.2). Mining (mainly \ncopper and gold) and crude oil exports together climbed by about 30% \nin value, despite declines in export volumes of gold (4%) and oil (9%). \nAgricultural exports shot up in value by about 45%: palm oil 51%, coffee \n20%, and copra 87%. (The increase was achieved despite a sharp fall in \ncocoa exports due to bad weather and disease.) The value of forestry \nproducts shipments rose, too, but fisheries and other marine exports fell.\n\nAfter a highly expansionary fiscal stance in 2009, when the \n\ngovernment drew down heavily on savings accumulated in public trust \nfunds during past commodity boom years, the authorities reduced \ntrust-fund drawdowns and spending in 2010.

As a result, the fiscal deficit narrowed significantly \nto 0.5% of GDP, including off-budget items (Figure 3.33.3). Excluding \noff-budget spending from trust funds, the budget again showed a near-\nbalanced outcome.\n\nInflation eased for a second year to average 6.0% in 2010, in large part \na result of a pullback in food-price inflation (Figure 3.33.4). However, there \nare concerns that the consumer price index might understate inflation \nbecause its composition is outdated. The index excludes housing costs, \nthus direct effects of surging rents in urban centers are not captured.\nGrowth in private sector credit slowed to a still high 17% in 2010 \nand broad money supply growth subsided to 12.5%. The Bank of Papua \nNew Guinea raised the cash-reserve requirement for commercial banks \nin October 2010 to 4.0% from 3.0% to reduce excess liquidity, but kept \nits policy interest rate steady at 7.0% throughout the year. The kina \nexchange rate depreciated by 8% in 2010 against a trade-weighted basket \nof currencies, mainly due to the strength of the Australian dollar.\n\nA surge in imports of equipment for the LNG plant, mainly funded \nby foreign direct investment, more than offset higher export receipts in \n2010. The merchandise trade deficit widened to about 11% of GDP and the \ncurrent account deficit to an estimated 27% of GDP. An increase in gross \nforeign\texchange\treserves\tto\t$2.6\tbillion\t(equivalent\tto\t15.3\tmonths\tof\t\nnonmineral imports of goods and services) was attributable to inflows of \nforeign direct investment.\n\nThe government in 2010 decided to move new public trust accounts \n\nto the central bank, a move that should give the monetary authorities \nbetter control over banking sector liquidity. Existing trust fund balances, \nhowever, remain in the commercial banking system.\n\nIn another important policy development, the government established \n\na working group, chaired by the Treasury, to oversee establishment of \na sovereign wealth fund. The plan is to manage revenue from resources \nthrough the offshore fund, with drawdowns to be channeled through the \nbudget. This should help to shield the economy and the budget from the \nimpact of swings in global commodity prices.\n\nEconomic prospects\nPlans have been disclosed for a second LNG project, to cost $4 billion, \nand its developers have said construction could start late this year. Given \nuncertainty about the construction timetable, the outlook does not factor \nin any direct impact from this proposal.\n\nConstruction of the first LNG plant will accelerate this year (it faced \n\nsome delays in 2010 owing to land access and compensation issues), \nthereby increasing activity in the construction and transport industries \nin particular. Still, the government estimates that only 4.5% of project \ninvestment will be retained in the domestic economy because most of the \noutlays are for imported goods and services.\n\nThe\t$1.4\tbillion\tRamu\tnickel\u2013cobalt\tmine,\tdelayed\tlast\tyear\tover\t\nenvironmental concerns, is assumed to start production in 2011. Output \nfrom some operating mines is projected to rise, too. However, crude oil \nextraction rates will continue to fall as fields mature.\n\n3.33.3  Budget balance\n\nOfficial\nAdjusted for trust funds\nNonmineral\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Papua New Guinea Department of Treasury. 2010 \nNational Budget.

Cocoa output is expected to rebound after it \nsuffered from disease in 2010, and coffee production will rise, weather \npermitting.\n\nOn the balance of these factors, GDP growth is forecast to step \nup to 8.5% in 2011 (Figure 3.33.5), then ease to about 6.5% in 2012 when \nconstruction of the first LNG plant starts to taper off.\n\nPrice pressures will intensify this year in view of the demands on \nlabor and resources from the first LNG plant. Supply-side constraints are \napparent in construction and transport, the property markets in Port \nMoresby and Lae, and in skilled labor.\n\nHigher global food and oil prices, coupled with last year\u2019s depreciation \n\nof the kina (against the Australian dollar especially) will fuel inflation, \nwhich is projected to accelerate to average about 8.0% this year and be \nnear this rate in 2012. The central bank is expected to tighten monetary \npolicy as inflation pressure builds.\n\nThe 2011 budget targets a balanced position, excluding trust fund \nexpenditure. Nevertheless, there may be pressures on the government \nto spend more from trust funds ahead of elections expected in 2012. \nFurther, a large portion of previous years\u2019 trust fund withdrawals may \nyet be spent. Such expenditure would result in a fiscal deficit and add to \ninflation pressures.\n\nA buildup in net foreign assets has partially offset the impact \nof a reduction in net domestic assets on growth in money supply \n(Figure 3.33.6). This could add to inflation if the trend continues in 2011.\n\nIn the external accounts, higher levels of imports for resource projects \n\nwill continue to widen the current account deficit, to around 35% of \nGDP in 2011 and 2012 (Figure 3.33.7). This gap will be largely financed \nby foreign direct investment. Foreign reserves are expected to remain \nadequate in terms of import cover.\n\nRisks to the forecasts on the upside would come from an early start \nto work on the second LNG plant or from higher than expected prices \nfor export commodities. The main downside risk is seen in further delays \nto large resource projects from disputes over land and compensation for \nlandowners.\n\nIn the medium term, production from the first LNG plant will \nunderpin growth in GDP, but the likelihood of more such plants is \nuncertain. There are also uncertainties over mineral production: several \nlarge mines are forecast to close sometime in 2012\u20132015. It will be \nimportant that the authorities are cautious about committing to any \nsubstantial increases in expenditure, given that they will not receive \nsignificant revenue from the first LNG plant until 2018 and that receipts \nfrom mining depend on global prices and the life of the mines.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nAlthough the economy has experienced sustained economic growth, \ndriven primarily by development of minerals, the direct contribution of \nminerals to reducing poverty is limited. Few of the poor depend directly \non mining and the links between mining and the rest of the economy \nare weak. There is currently no official measure of poverty but social \n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Papua New Guinea Department of Treasury. 2010 \nNational Budget.

Indeed, Papua New Guinea is not expected to meet any of the \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015, and is ranked 137 out of 169 \ncountries in the 2010 human development index compiled by the United \nNations Development Programme.\n\nThe government will have an opportunity to improve living standards \n\nby rehabilitating infrastructure and upgrading basic services when \nsubstantial revenue starts to flow to the budget from LNG projects. It will \nalso have funds to meet adjustment costs of structural reforms to open \nbusiness sectors controlled by state-owned enterprises, such as ports and \nelectricity, to private competition.\n\nThe government\u2019s medium-term development plan for 2011\u20132015 \n\nrecognizes these challenges and paves the way for a stronger effort \nto address them. It puts more emphasis on policy achievements and \nresults-based monitoring of the public service. Government commitment \nto the plan will be critical if agencies are to be held accountable for \nunderperformance. Further, realizing the plan\u2019s goals will require marked \nimprovements in the public service and public financial management.\nManaging volatile flows of revenue from resources is a continuing \n\nchallenge. The government has usually erred on the side of caution, \nunder-forecasting commodity prices so that mineral revenue has tended \nto exceed budget targets (Figure 3.33.8). This generates large windfall \nrevenue that has been directed to discretionary capital spending in \nsupplementary budgets. \n\nIt would, though, be helpful if the supplementary budget process was \nmore flexible, to allow some of these funds to be spent on rehabilitation \nand maintenance of public infrastructure. The plan to manage resource \nrevenue through a sovereign wealth fund should help to smooth revenue \nflows to the budget.\n\nImprovements to the business environment, including reforms of \nstate-owned enterprises, are required to generate sustainable growth \nand employment in nonmineral sectors. The World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness 2011 report ranks Papua New Guinea 103 out of 183 countries, \nup from 108 in 2010. The improvement in the overall ranking stemmed \nfrom easier availability of credit (though its ranking dropped for other \nsub-indicators). The lack of enforcement of contracts is, in particular, a \ndeterrent to investment.\n\n3.33.8  Budget revenue forecasts\n\nMineral revenue\n\nNonmineral revenue\n\nOutturn-to-budget ratio\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n03\n\n04\n\n08\n\n05\n\n10\n\n07\n\n09\n\n2002\n\n06\nNote: If the ratio is greater than 1, the outturn is larger than \nthe budget target.\nSource: ADB estimates using Papua New Guinea budget \ndocuments, 2002\u20132010.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fTimor-Leste\n\nDriven by increases in government expenditure, this petroleum-dependent economy grew rapidly in 2010 \nand  is  forecast  to  record  double-digit  growth  in  2011  and  2012.  Higher  oil  prices  are  positive  overall \nfor  the  country,  but  they  have  also  fueled  inflation.  Longer-term  prospects  rest  on  using  government \ninvestment  to  build  human  and  physical  capital  and  to  trigger  a  transition  to  private  sector\u2013led  growth.\n\nEconomic performance\nEconomic momentum generated by a rapid buildup in government \nspending has resulted in the preferred measure of GDP\u2014excluding \noffshore petroleum production and the United Nations (UN) \npeacekeeping mission\u2014averaging double-digit growth in 2007\u20132010.

Private consumption was boosted in 2010 \nby a continued rise in public sector wages and salaries, as well as cash \ntransfers provided in rural areas through a wide-ranging social safety \nnet. There was a further large expansion last year both in small, rural \ninfrastructure projects and in larger public projects in the capital, Dili.\nPrivate investment also climbed as local and overseas-owned \n\nbusinesses geared up to take advantage of the opportunities presented by \nrising public investment and buoyant consumer spending.\n\nA high level of aggregate demand is reflected in a range of indicators, \n\nincluding new vehicle registrations, electricity use, and mobile phone \nsubscribers (Figure 3.34.2), albeit with some sign of an easing in growth \nin 2010.\n\nConstruction expanded alongside rising investment. Agricultural \n\noutput, which contributes around 30% of GDP, barely rose in 2010 \nbecause of bad weather and continuing transport problems. This \nfollowed 2 years of 13% growth in the sector, when it was bolstered by \ngovernment-led distribution of better seeds and of tractors, and by the \nintroduction of extension services. The Ministry of Agriculture estimated \nthat rice production declined by 6.4% in 2010. Maize production, though, \nrose by an estimated 10.5%, and coffee exports rose from an unusually low \n10,000 tons in 2009 to 25,600 tons in 2010.\n\nMerchandise exports, mainly coffee, represent less than 10% of the \n\nThis chapter was written by Craig Sugden of the Special Office in Timor-Leste, ADB, Dili.\n\n3.34.1  Government expenditure\n\nDonor-funded\nOwn-funded\n\n$ million\n1,000\n\n750\n\n500\n\n250\n\n0\n\nTotal\n% of GDP\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n06\n\n07\n\n10\n\n09\n\n2005\n\n08\nNote: Nonpetroleum, non-UN GDP.\nSource: ADB estimates based on Government of Timor-\nLeste. 2009.

The wide trade deficit, in the order of 65% \nof nonpetroleum, non-UN GDP, is outweighed by a surplus in the income \naccount attributable to petroleum revenue.

Bank lending remained \nconstrained by a backlog of nonperforming loans and a continuing \nproblem of securing land as collateral. Consequently, commercial bank \ncredit to the private sector was unchanged in 2010 from 2009.\n\nInflation accelerated to average 6.8% in 2010 and was running at 9.2% \nyear on year in December (Figure 3.34.3). Rising food prices were the main \nreason, themselves largely due to higher international prices. Inflation \nwas lower for prices set by domestic rather than international conditions, \nsuggesting that inflation was cost push rather than demand pull.\n\nEconomic prospects\nOutlooks for the short and medium term rest heavily on developments \nin government expenditure. The government has budgeted to boost its \nown-funded\tspending\tby\tabout\t50%\tto\t$1.27\tbillion\tin\t2011.\tMuch\tof\t\nthe increase is for a multiyear national electrification project and will \nnot be fully spent in 2011, but a sizable increase in actual expenditure is \nprojected for 2011.

Factors in \nTimor-Leste\u2019s favor include a growing \nlabor force, an ability to fund a \nhigh rate of public investment from \npetroleum revenue, and the potential \nfor a quick catch-up in education and \ntechnology.\n\nA continuation of recent double-\ndigit rates of economic growth would \nprobably require investment rising \nabove $1 billion annually within \n5 years and above $1.5 billion within \n10 years (in 2010 prices). This would \nbe a very large increase on the 2010 \ninvestment level of about $300 million.\nProjections made using the growth \naccounting framework show that lower, \nbut still internationally high, rates of \neconomic growth could be achieved \nif investment was around half these \nlevels. This lower estimate of annual \ninvestment\u2014at least $500 million and \n$750 million\u2014sets a minimum target.\n\nSource: C. Sugden. Forthcoming. Timor-Leste: \nEconomic Growth to 2030. Asian Development \nBank, Manila.\n\n232    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\ninflation. It should avoid continually adjusting public sector wages \nto compensate for the higher cost of living, which could result in a \nwage\u2013price spiral. That would have the potential to turn what is largely \na problem of imported inflation into a deeper risk to macroeconomic \nstability.\n\nThe high rate of economic growth projected for the medium term \nwill see further inroads into poverty. Average household incomes rose \nby about 20% in 2007\u20132009, helping to reduce the incidence of poverty \nfrom an estimated 50% to a still high 41%. The rate of progress in poverty \nreduction will rest on success in continuing to expand basic public \nservices and in providing economic opportunities in rural areas.\n\nDevelopment challenges\nDevelopment is being fast-tracked through the conversion of petroleum \nwealth into physical and human capital. The surge in government \nexpenditure funded from petroleum revenue is enabling a rapid \nexpansion in public services and has provided a public social safety \nnet for many. After ranking 150 of 159 countries in the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s 2005 human development index, Timor-\nLeste\u2019s position improved to 120 of 162 in the 2010 index.\n\nStill, development challenges are daunting. Income from petroleum \nlifted Timor-Leste to lower-middle-income country status in 2007, but \nother indicators of development generally remain those of a low-income \ncountry. Of the 21 measurable Millennium Development Goals, about \nhalf are unlikely to be met by the target date of 2015, notably those \nrelating to poverty and nutrition. The coverage of electricity, water, and \ntelecommunications infrastructure has expanded, but access and service \nquality are below potential. Most of the road network is in poor condition.\nPublic investment needs are likely to stay high over the next decade \nand beyond (Box 3.34.1). Fiscal constraints will, however, ultimately limit \npublic investment\u2019s ability to support the economy. Sustaining a high \nrate of economic growth will rest on a transition from public to private \nsector\u2013led investment. As the domestic private sector is still emerging and \nnot yet ready for major investments, there is likely to be a gap that will \nneed to be filled by foreign inflows. The country\u2019s success in establishing \nitself as one of developing Asia\u2019s investment destinations will therefore be \npivotal to its growth path.\n\nIdeally the level of public investment will be responsive to the returns \n\nthat it generates. The fundamental rule of public investment is that it \nshould generate an economic return\u2014broadly defined to capture the full \nrange of factors that determine community welfare\u2014at least as high as \nthe economic cost of funding. Most public investment will need to be \nfunded by withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund. Such investment should \naim for a return that exceeds the cost of withdrawals, being the financial \nreturn that would have been earned if savings had remained in the fund.\n\nThe government has flagged the prospect of borrowing on concessional \n\nterms to fund public investment. Similarly, any public investment funded \nfrom borrowing should aim for a return higher than the interest rate paid, \nplus any other costs. Borrowing makes sense if it allows savings to be kept \nin the Petroleum Fund to earn a return higher than the cost of the debt.\n\n\fSmall Pacific countries\n\nSeven of the 11 small Pacific economies grew in 2010, albeit slightly, and GDP was estimated to be flat in \nthree.  GDP  fell  in  one  (Tonga),  in  contrast  to  2009  when  the  global  recession  contributed  to  contraction \nin  seven  economies. \n\nThe  pickup  in  global  travel  in  2010  helped  some  countries.  Government  infrastructure  projects,  mostly \ndonor  financed,  also  supported  economic  activity,  notably  in  the  Cook  Islands,  the  Marshall  Islands,  and \nthe Federated States of Micronesia. Export receipts remained weak, however (except for Solomon Islands). \nInflation  decelerated  from  2009  levels  for  most  economies.\n\nThe  economic  outlook  is  more  positive  for  2011  on  the  back  of  continued  global  recovery.  This  will \ncontribute to increased tourism earnings, export receipts, and remittances. Several economies will benefit \nfrom  greater  spending  on  public  infrastructure.  Growth  is  forecast  to  pick  up  in  eight  countries  this  year \nand,  and  for  about  half  of  them,  edge  still  higher  in  2012.\n\nInflation is projected to increase in all 11 countries this year, primarily owing to higher global food and fuel \nprices  for  these  import-dependent  economies,  before  price  pressures  ease  for  most  of  them  in  2012.\n\nCook Islands\nAfter 2 years of contraction, this economy grew by 0.5% in FY2010 (ended \n30 June 2010), supported by expansion of tourism and fisheries, as well as \nthe start of construction on some donor-financed infrastructure projects.\nVisitor arrivals and expenditure rose by 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. \n\nExports of fish (54% of total exports) increased by 15.9%. These \nperformances offset a 10.1% decline in pearl exports caused by a shortage \nof skilled pearl-seeding technicians.\n\nGrowth is projected to pick up to 2.0% in FY2011 (Figure 3.35.1), \n\nas infrastructure projects, including development of Avatiu port, \ngain momentum. However, tourism is subdued because of softness in \nconsumer spending in New Zealand, the main source of visitors. Growth \nprospects are more positive for FY2012, on the expectation that tourism \nwill pick up and infrastructure investment will increase. GDP growth is \nforecast to rise to 2.5% that year.\n\nInflation moderated to 3.5% in FY2010, but will likely quicken to \naverage 4.0% in FY2011. Higher prices for imported oil and commodities, \ncoupled with increased construction activity, have pushed up prices for \nfood, housing-related costs (including electricity), and transport.\n\nThis chapter was written by Stephen Pollard and Elbe Aguba of the Pacific Department, \nADB, Manila; Emma Ferguson and Laisiasa Tora of the Pacific Subregional Office, ADB, \nSuva; Milovan Lucich of the Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office, ADB, Sydney; and \nRommel Rabanal, consultant.\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nGDP growth, Cook\n\n3.35.1  GDP growth, Cook Islands \n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \nBudget Estimates 2010/11: Part 1 Appropriation Bill \nAppropriations and Commentary. http://www.mfem.gov.ck; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f234    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nMerchandise exports fell by 21% in FY2010, largely owing to the \nproblems with pearl production, while imports rose by 42%. The trade \ndeficit widened, and is expected to worsen as import growth, driven \nmainly by materials for projects that donors are financing, outpaces \nexports.\n\nGovernment revenue exceeded budget estimates by 4.3% in FY2010, a \n\nresult of better than expected receipts from company tax and one-time \nrevenue from fines for illegal fishing. Expenditure was 9.6% over \nbudget, partly on account of supplementary appropriations to cover \ncyclone recovery expenses and subsidies for Air New Zealand flights \nfrom Rarotonga to Sydney and Los Angeles. Still, the budget deficit of \nNZ$2.7\tmillion\t(0.8%\tof\tGDP)\tnarrowed\tsharply\tfrom\t11.7%\tin\tFY2009.\nThe FY2011 budget projects an operating surplus of 0.2% of GDP \n(Figure 3.35.2), but this was framed against an earlier backdrop of a more \npositive tourism outlook. Consequently, revenue collections will need to \nbe revised down. The government is aiming to trim expenditure by 1.5% \nrelative\tto\tFY2010.\tPublic\tdebt\tis\tprojected\tto\tfall\tby\tNZ$30\tmillion\tto\t\nNZ$114.8\tmillion\tin\tFY2011\t(equivalent\tto\t34%\tof\tGDP),\tmainly\tdue\tto\t\nmovements in exchange rates.\n\nKiribati\nThis economy, too, performed better in 2010, following 2 years \nof contraction (Figure 3.35.3). Estimated GDP growth of 0.5% was \nattributable mainly to additional spending by the public sector and \nto some pickup in private sector activity, especially in construction \nand retailing. This performance offset a fall in remittances and copra \nproduction.\n\nRemittances from the country\u2019s seafarers, which account for about 7% \n\nof GDP, fell by an estimated 13% in 2010 because of weakening demand \nfor the country\u2019s seafarers and greater supply of such workers from other \nnations. Production of copra declined owing to bad weather.\n\nWage increases for the public service and higher subsidies for copra \n\nproduction were major factors in widening the budget deficit to an \nestimated 15% of GDP in 2010. The 2011 budget projects a further rise in \npublic service wages, and in infrastructure investment, pushing the deficit \nout to 19% of GDP. The gap is to be financed from the country\u2019s wealth \nfund and short-term loans.\n\nThe value of the wealth fund\u2014the main source of deficit financing\u2014\n\ndeclined\tfrom\tA$637\tmillion\t(420%\tof\tGDP)\tin\t2007\tto\tA$571\tmillion\t\n(350% of GDP) in 2009, primarily due to losses on investments, as well \nas drawdowns that averaged around 19% of GDP annually from 2007 to \n2010. Although the fund\u2019s investments recovered marginally last year, \nconcerns remain about its sustainability. The International Monetary \nFund recommends that the budget deficit be limited to 6.0% of GDP to \npreserve long-term financial sustainability.\n\nFiscal risks are likely to worsen if the government undertakes \n\nsubstantial external borrowing to fund capital works, and if drawdowns \nfrom the wealth fund remain high. The government has adopted a \nmedium-term fiscal framework that should help to maintain fiscal \ndiscipline.\n\n3.35.2  Fiscal balance, Cook Islands\n\nNZ$ million\n\n% of GDP\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n2010\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \n2010.

These include \nrevamping the international airports in Tarawa and Kiritimati, upgrading \nthe South Tarawa Road, and extending Betio port.\n\nInflation slowed to average 0.8% in 2010 (Figure 3.35.4), reflecting \nappreciation of the Australian dollar and the lagged pass-through from \ninternational to domestic prices. This year, though, inflation is expected \nto accelerate to 6.7%, driven by higher prices for imported fuel and food.\nThe current account deficit is set to widen from about 14% of GDP \nin 2010 to about 23% in 2012, in part a result of lower investment income \nfrom the wealth fund as drawdowns become smaller.\n\nMarshall Islands\nSupported by grant-financed increases in government spending and \nexpansion in fish processing, the economy grew by an estimated 0.5% in \nFY2010 (ended 30 September 2010). This represented a turnaround after \n2 years of declining GDP (Figure 3.35.5). Higher global prices of copra and \ncoconut oil\u2014the country\u2019s major agricultural exports\u2014contributed to \nsome increase in export receipts.\n\nThe fiscal balance improved, posting a surplus of about 0.3% of GDP \nin FY2010 (compared with a deficit the previous year), owing to improved \ntax collection and an increase in fishing fee income. Inflation quickened \nto 1.0% on higher prices for fuel, electricity, and transport.\n\nIn preparation for when grants under the Compact of Free \n\nAssociation with the United States (US) expire, scheduled for 2024, the \ngovernment is implementing tax reforms this year that aim to improve \nthe fiscal position, including by raising revenue. It has taken some \nmeasures to trim expenditure, but needs to make more cuts for long-term \nfiscal sustainability. Such reductions could include allowances for civil \nservants and public officials and assistance to state enterprises.\n\nEconomic growth is expected to pick up marginally to 1.0% in FY2011 \n\nand 1.2% in FY2012. The outlook is supported by additional grants from \nTaipei,China and the European Union, which will partly offset the impact \nof a 5.5% cut in government spending this year. Fisheries, a key source \nof income, could benefit from planned subregional collaboration on \nmanaging fish-stocks.\n\nInflation is forecast to accelerate to about 5.0% in FY2011 on rising \nfood and oil prices, coupled with some renewed demand-side pressures \nas the economy grows, before moderating to 3.8% in FY2012 as global \ncommodity price pressures subside (Figure 3.35.6).\n\nRisks to the outlook center on rising prices for commodities, a \n\npossible further downsizing of the US military base on Kwajalein, and the \npace of phasing down compact-related grants from the US.\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\nGrowth of an estimated 0.5% in FY2010 (ended 30 September 2010) \nfollowed a similar increase in GDP in FY2009 (revised from a previously \nestimated slight contraction).\n\nThe modest expansion was driven by public infrastructure projects, \n\n%\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n%\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund.

The reopening of a fish-processing plant \nin Kosrai and an increase in small-scale agriculture stimulated by rising \ncommodity prices helped the economy, as did some uplift in remittances \nand tourism receipts.\n\nInflation subsided to about 3.5% in FY2010, owing to lower prices for \n\nimported food and energy in the early part of the year.\n\nReflecting a general weakness in consumption spending, food imports \n\nfrom the US, the main trading partner, fell by 6.7% in value in FY2010.\nThe government trimmed expenditure by 3.6% in FY2010, cutting \ncapital spending by almost 20% while raising current spending by 2.1% \n(for the public wage bill and subsidies). Tax revenue growth of 7.9% \nhelped to generate a small fiscal surplus.\n\nThe fiscal situation has improved markedly since FY2009, in part \nbecause of efforts by state governments to raise revenue collection and cut \nspending. Nevertheless, much further progress is needed before FY2023, \nwhen grants expire under the Compact of Free Association with the US.\nGDP growth is expected to pick up to 1.0% in FY2011 (Figure 3.35.7), \n\nbased on a pipeline of infrastructure projects and the release of \ninfrastructure funds delayed in previous years. With the Pohnpei airport \nextension scheduled for completion in mid-2011, improved direct flight \nconnections could expand opportunities for tourism and exports. GDP \ngrowth is forecast at 0.8% in FY2012.\n\nInflation will likely inch up to 4.0% in FY2011 owing to higher global \n\ncommodity prices, before easing to 3.0% in FY2012.\n\nSluggish development of the private sector, which is hindered \nby inadequate infrastructure, lack of skilled labor, and investment \nrestrictions, remains an impediment to growth.\n\nNauru\nGDP was likely flat in FY2010 (ended 30 June 2010) (Figure 3.35.8) because \nstorm damage to the port and weak demand restricted exports of \nphosphate.\n\nRepairs to the port, funded by the Russian Federation, with modest \nrecovery in world phosphate demand, are expected to support a return \nto economic growth in FY2011 and FY2012. GDP growth of about 4% is \nforecast for each year.\n\nConsumer prices declined by an estimated 0.5% in FY2010. The cost of \ntelecommunications fell as a result of the entry of a new mobile telephone \nand Internet service provider. In FY2011 and FY2012, however, higher \nglobal food and fuel prices are expected to induce inflation of 2.5%.\n\nThe\tFY2010\tbudget\toutturn\twas\ta\tnet\tcash\tposition\tof\tA$7.7\tmillion,\t\nwith\tthe\tsurplus\tachieved\tafter\town-funded\texpenditure\tof\tA$20.2\tmillion\t\nand\tdonor-funded\texpenditure\tof\tA$11.2\tmillion.\tThis\tfiscal\tyear\u2019s\t\nbudget maintains the prudent fiscal management adopted since 2004. \nSpending\tin\tFY2011\tis\tbudgeted\tat\tA$29.0\tmillion\t(excluding\tdonor-\nfunded projects), down by 9% from FY2010.

Longer-term prospects depend on government reforms both \nto improve public financial management and the performance of state-\nowned enterprises, and to revitalize mining and quarrying, which now \ninclude coral aggregate used in construction (as well as phosphate). \nTourism and fisheries offer untapped opportunities for greater economic \nself-sufficiency.\n\nPalau\nAn upturn in tourism compensated for cuts in public expenditure to \ndrive growth estimated at about 2.0% in FY2010 (ended 30 September \n2010). This was the first year of growth after 4 consecutive years of \ncontraction.\n\nTourism, which accounts for around half GDP, had seen visitor \n\narrivals drop by a cumulative 16.5% over the previous 2 years. In \nFY2010, arrivals picked up by 11.7% as a result of the global economic \nrecovery, new airline and charter connections to Palau, and intensified \nadvertising and promotion. Growth was particularly strong in arrivals \nfrom Taipei,China. Arrivals from Japan, the largest source of visitors, \nrose sharply during the northern summer months. Total monthly arrivals \nrecovered to 2007\u2019s levels by the second half of 2010 (Figure 3.35.9).\n\nDomestic demand appears to have picked up a little last fiscal year. \n\nConsumption spending, as measured by the value of monthly food \nimports from the US, was just above the previous year\u2019s level. However, \npublic investment on infrastructure projects remained low.\n\nInflation slowed to an estimated 3.8% on average from 5.2% in FY2009, \n\ndue primarily to lagged effects of lower international prices of fuel and \nother commodities early in the year. Transport and household costs \ndeclined in the first quarter before climbing steadily.\n\nThe original budget for FY2010 intended to reduce public \n\nexpenditure by about 10%, as a start toward bringing outlays down to \nmore sustainable levels. In a reversal of a recent trend of overoptimistic \nrevenue projections, which had led to drawdowns in cash reserves and \naccumulation of public debt, the revenue shortfall was budgeted to \nnarrow in FY2010.\n\nHowever, a supplementary budget passed later in the year partly \nreversed the spending cuts and restored current expenditure to about \nthe FY2009 level. Given the scheduled ending in FY2024 of grants from \nthe US under the Compact of Free Association, it will be important \nto gradually reduce current expenditure to more sustainable levels, \nparticularly the wages bill for the public service and purchases of goods \nand services. Otherwise, more severe spending cuts will be needed later. \nThese reductions should be put through in parallel with increases in \ngovernment revenue. Raising utility charges to eventually reflect the cost \nof service delivery would help.\n\n3.35.9  Visitor arrivals, Palau\n2009\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\nThousand persons\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\nApr\n\nJan \n\nJul\nSource: Palau Visitors Authority. http://www.visit-palau.com \n(accessed 16 March 2011).\nClick here for figure data\n\nOct\n\n\f238    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nEconomic prospects remain largely dependent on the outlook for \ntourism. Visitor arrivals are projected to increase by around 7% in FY2011 \n(the first-quarter performance was strong), followed by another 5% gain \nin FY2012. Such expansion in tourism would help take GDP growth to 2% \nin FY2011 and 1.5% in FY2012 (Figure 3.35.10).\n\nInflation is projected at about 4.0% in FY2011, lifted by higher global \n\nfood and fuel prices, easing to 2.5% in FY2012 as commodity price \nincreases moderate.\n\nSamoa\nDeclines in agriculture, tourism receipts, and remittances offset growth \nin construction, manufacturing, and transport and communications in \nFY2010 (ended 30 June 2010), leaving GDP flat.\n\nEven though visitor arrivals rose by 3.5% to 131,300, earnings from \n\ntourism\tfell\tby\t6.0%\tto\t$130\tmillion\towing\tto\ta\tdecrease\tin\ttourist\t\nspending\tper\thead.\tRemittances\tfell\tby\t5.3%\tto\t$148.8\tmillion.\n\nMerchandise\texports\tincreased\tby\t18.8%\tto\t$12.2\tmillion\tin\tFY2010,\t\nled by strong performances from nonu fruit and coconut oil.

A wider trade deficit, coupled with reduced \nremittances, saw the current account deficit worsen to 8.1% of GDP.\n\nHowever, the overall balance of payments was in surplus due to net \ndisbursement of government loans for tsunami reconstruction (a tsunami \nhit coastal areas in September 2009). Foreign exchange reserves of \n$165.7\tmillion\tat\tJune\t2010\twere\tequivalent\tto\t7.6\tmonths\tof\timport\tcover.\nInflation slowed to average 1.2% in FY2010. The deceleration was \na result of falling commodity prices and subdued domestic economic \nactivity.\n\nFiscal policy was exceptionally expansionary in FY2010, with a budget \n\ndeficit equivalent to 8.1% of GDP. Spending was boosted by measures \nto counter the impact of the global recession on the domestic economy, \ncoupled with post-tsunami reconstruction. These steps were largely \nfunded by grants and concessional borrowing. External debt levels went \nup to about 43% of GDP by end-FY2010 (Figure 3.35.11), exceeding the \ngovernment\u2019s 40% target.\n\nThe FY2011 budget continues high levels of expenditure, reflecting the \n\nreconstruction effort and increases in public sector wages and pensions. \nThe fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 9.3% of GDP.\n\nThe rise in government spending, and in private consumption to a \nlesser degree, are expected to produce a return to economic growth in \nFY2011, forecast at 2.1%. A stronger tourism marketing effort is likely \nto have some positive impact in FY2011, and private remittances should \nbenefit from economic growth in Australia. For the first 7 months of \nFY2011, earnings from tourism and remittances rose by 4.0% and 1.1%, \nrespectively.\n\nGrowth is seen rising to 3.0% in FY2012 on continued post-tsunami \n\nreconstruction and an expected increase in tourism.\n\nInflation is projected to increase to around 3.0% this year as domestic \neconomic activity picks up and as a result of higher global food and fuel \nprices.\n\n3.35.10  GDP growth, Palau\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForecast\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2010.

Although the deficits are to be financed \nthrough concessional borrowing and grants, sustaining such a stance \nholds risks\u2014the government would find it hard to adjust to any external \nshocks, for example.\n\nStructural reforms to improve the commercial focus of state-owned \n\nenterprises and to increase access to, and economic use of, customary \nland are needed for the potential benefits of public investment to be \nrealized.\n\nSolomon Islands\nThis economy recovered in 2010, growing by an estimated 4.0% after \ncontracting by 1.2% in 2009 (Figure 3.35.13). Logging led the upturn. After \na poor year in 2009, log export volumes rose by about 30% in 2010, a \nresult of recovering demand in Asia that also helped to lift international \nlog prices. Production of palm oil and cocoa, as well as the size of the fish \ncatch, also increased, although copra production declined.\n\nThe services sector was sluggish in the first half of 2010, but \n\nbusiness conditions improved in the second half according to a business \nexpectations survey. Building activity indicators suggested expansion in \nconstruction as well.\n\nGDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 7.5% in 2011, when the Gold \nRidge mine in Guadalcanal is due to start producing and exporting gold. \nLogging is expected to decline during the forecast period, owing to falls \nin logging resources, but stronger global demand for other commodity \nexports, such as palm oil and copra, will bolster growth. Other positive \nfactors include an expected rise in foreign investment in mining, \nincluding a new copper mine, and in telecommunications. Growth of \nabout 4.0% is projected for 2012.\n\nInflation eased to average about 3.0% in 2010, largely due to a 40% fall \n\nin the price of rice caused by greater competition in food imports (rice \nconstitutes around 18% of the consumer price index). Looking ahead, \nthough, inflation is expected to accelerate to 4.2% this year and 6.3% in \n2012, as a result of higher global prices for fuel and commodities and \nstronger domestic demand as the economy grows.\n\nAt an estimated 20% of GDP, the current account deficit remained \n\nwide in 2010, reflecting high levels of imports of mining and \ntelecommunications equipment. The start of gold exports this year, \ncoupled with growth in agricultural exports, is seen pulling back the \ndeficit to 15% of GDP.\n\nDespite the trade and current account deficits, foreign reserves rose to \nthe equivalent of about 9 months of import cover, a consequence of large \ninflows\tof\tdonor\tfunds\tand\tthe\tfirst\ttranche\tof\ta\tUS$18.3\tmillion\tstand-by\t\ncredit facility approved by the International Monetary Fund in June 2010. \nHalf this credit was disbursed in 2010 and the rest is scheduled for 2011. \nForeign reserves are expected to remain strong in 2011, at about 6 months \nof import cover.\n\nA tight fiscal situation for much of 2010 led to restrictions on \nexpenditure until the fourth quarter and a government recruitment \nfreeze. Budget support from donors, including large sums in the \n\n\f240    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n\nsecond half of the year, together with a better than expected revenue \nperformance, resulted in a budget surplus.\n\nAfter elections in August 2010, the incoming government was unable \nto draft a full budget before year-end, and instead passed a supplementary \nappropriations bill that enabled spending to continue in the first 3 months \nof 2011, at no higher than in the same period of 2010.\n\nTonga\nWeakness in remittance and tourism contributed to a 1.2% contraction \nin GDP in FY2010 (ended 30 June 2010). Remittances fell by 10.0% and \nearnings from tourism fell by 13.3% owing to slow recovery in source \ncountries, particularly New Zealand and the US. GDP has contracted in 3 \nof the past 4 years (Figure 3.35.14).\n\nPrivate sector credit fell by around 13% in December 2010, in part \nreflecting consolidation in the banking sector and the write-off of bad \ndebts.\n\nThe government trimmed its nonwage operating costs and \n\nown-funded capital spending in FY2010, in response to a 4.0% decline \nin revenue (it fell short of the target by more than 20%). Budget support \nfrom donors limited the deficit to about 1.0% of GDP; without that \nsupport the gap would have been 2.3%.\n\nIn the external accounts, increased receipts from exports of sea \ncucumber more than made up for declines in fish and agricultural \nproducts in FY2010, so that total exports grew by 2.2%. Imports fell \nsharply, by 21.0%, reflecting weak domestic demand. The current account \ndeficit\tnarrowed\tto\t$16.6\tmillion\tfrom\t$24.8\tin\tFY2009.\tOfficial\tforeign\t\nreserves\tamounted\tto\t$98\tmillion\tat\tend-December\t2010,\tequivalent\tto\t\n7.9 months of imports (Figure 3.35.15).\n\nDonor-funded infrastructure activities are expected to support \na return to economic growth of about 0.5% in FY2011. Government \nspending is budgeted to rise by 14.9%, based on commitments from \ndonors, and will contribute to aggregate demand through higher public \nsector wages. Revenue, excluding grants, is to remain weak.\n\nInflation eased to 2.0% last year, mainly the result of better supplies \n\nand a related fall in prices for domestically produced food, as well as \nlower school fees. It is forecast to rise to about 3.0% in FY2011 on upward \npressure from world oil prices and higher prices for imports from New \nZealand, in part a result of exchange rate movements.\n\nTuvalu\nThis economy continued to feel the impact of the global recession in \n2010. Even with higher government spending, GDP was estimated to be \nunchanged from 2009.\n\nSeafarer employment\u2014a significant income source for \n\nhouseholds\u2014was weak and is likely to remain so due to subdued demand \nfor Tuvaluan seafarers. Income from the \u201c.tv\u201d domain name and fisheries \nlicenses fell as the Australian dollar (which Tuvalu uses) gained parity \nwith the US dollar.

It approved three supplementary appropriation bills, together \naccounting for about 10% of GDP, in 2010. These were used to pay for \nthe government\u2019s guarantee of an Air Fiji loan (Tuvalu is the biggest \nshareholder in the airline) and to increase capital spending by 15.7% from \nthe original estimate.\n\nThe fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened sharply to almost 30% \n\nof GDP in 2010, owing to lackluster domestic revenue and increased \nexpenditure. Revenue is estimated to have declined by 17%, in part due to \nweak offshore income from all sources. Public debt (including guarantees) \nis about 44% of GDP, which is high for this small economy.\n\nThe value of the Tuvalu Trust Fund likely stabilized in 2010, after \n\nfalling during the global recession. However, no distributions from \nthis fund to the budget were made or are expected while international \nfinancial markets are volatile.\n\nThe economy is projected to stay flat in 2011 (Figure 3.35.16) as fiscal \nadjustments, mainly spending cuts, are made to ensure longer-term fiscal \nsustainability. Growth is expected to resume at about 0.5% in 2012 when \ndonor-financed public works employing local workers are scheduled to \nstart. Rising global food and fuel prices are likely to rekindle inflation, \nforecast at 1.5% in 2011 and 2.0% in 2012.\n\nThe number of households living in poverty has increased to about \n\n20%, based on a 2010 household survey, from 14% in 2004. Declining \nremittances is the major cause. One way to ensure that funds are available \nto meet basic health and education needs for the poor would be selective \ncuts to other spending, such as medical insurance and scholarship \nprograms, that benefit only a narrow section of the population.\n\nVanuatu\nGrowth slowed to an estimated 3.0% in 2010 from an average of 5.7% in \nthe previous 7 years. Agricultural production and construction increased, \nbut tourism and retailing were soft.\n\nThe prolonged period of growth (8 years in a row) is attributable to \n\nincreases in private investment, underpinned by policy reforms that \nincluded the opening of the aviation and telecommunications markets.\n\nLast year, tourist arrivals declined by an estimated 2.6%, from record \nnumbers in 2009 (Figure 3.35.17). The decline was largely due to a recovery \nin tourism to Fiji, which had lost market share to Vanuatu in 2009 \n(because of flooding and political uncertainty in Fiji).\n\nConstruction benefited from projects funded by the US Millennium \n\nChallenge Corporation as well as from some work on tourist facilities. \nBuoyed by higher prices for copra, coconut oil, and beef, agriculture \nrecovered from a poor performance in 2009.\n\nInflation eased to average 3.4% last year. In the external accounts, the \n\ncurrent account deficit likely widened to 2.4%, a result of lower tourism \nreceipts.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Vanuatu began to withdraw stimulus measures \n\nthat it had implemented during the global financial crisis.

Fiscal policy will \nlikely remain broadly neutral in 2011, as the government is required under \nlaw to target budget surpluses.\n\nGDP growth this year is forecast to rise to 4.2% (Figure 3.35.18), based \non an expected increase in tourist arrivals\u2014particularly from Australia\u2014\ndriven by robust economic conditions, a strong Australian dollar, and \nincreased flights from that country. Agriculture is expected to pick up \nowing to high commodity prices. GDP growth of around 4.0% is expected \nin 2012, on continued gains in tourism and agriculture.\n\nHigher food and fuel prices are forecast to raise inflation to 5.0% \nin 2011, before it eases to 4.0% in 2012. The current account deficit is \nexpected to widen in 2011 and 2012 to 3.8% and 4.7% of GDP, respectively, \nas the pickup in domestic demand lifts imports.\n\nInadequate transport infrastructure and services hinder development \nof rural areas and outer islands, where income-generating opportunities \nare scarce.

The economies are grouped into five subregions: Central Asia, \nEast Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Virtually all the \ntables contain historical data for 2006\u20132010; nearly half have forecasts for \n2010 and 2011.\n\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible in order to \nallow comparability over time and across economies, but differences \nin statistical methodology, definitions, coverage, and practices make \nfull comparability impossible. The national income accounts section is \nbased on the United Nations System of National Accounts, while the \nbalance-of-payments data are based on International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) accounting standards. Historical data were obtained from official \nsources, statistical publications and databases, and documents of the \nADB, IMF, and World Bank. Projections for 2011 and 2012 are generally \nstaff estimates made on the basis of available quarterly or monthly data, \nalthough some projections are from governments.\n\nMost countries report on a calendar-year basis. Some economies \nrecord their government finance data on a fiscal year basis, such as: \nArmenia; Azerbaijan; Cook Islands; Hong Kong, China; Kazakhstan; \nKyrgyz Republic; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR); \nSamoa; Singapore; Taipei,China; Tajikistan; Thailand; and Uzbekistan. \nFederated States of Micronesia, Nauru, the Marshall Islands, and Palau \nreport government finance and balance-of-payments data on a fiscal \nyear basis. South Asian countries (except for Maldives and Sri Lanka), \nMyanmar, and Tonga report all variables on a fiscal year basis.\n\nRegional and subregional averages/totals are provided for nine tables \n\n(A1, A2, A8, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14, and A15). For tables A1, A2, A8, \nand A15, the averages are computed using weights derived from levels \nof\tgross\tnational\tincome\t(GNI)\tin\tcurrent\tUnited\tStates\tdollars\t(US$)\t\nfollowing the World Bank Atlas method. The GNI data for 2006\u20132009 \nwere obtained from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators \nonline. Weights for 2009 were carried over through 2012. The GNI data \n\n\fStatistical appendix    245\n\nfor Cook Islands and Tuvalu were estimated using the Atlas conversion \nfactor. Myanmar and Nauru have no GNI data. For tables A10 and A12, \nthe regional and subregional averages were computed on the basis of a \nconsistent sum, which means that if there are missing country data for a \ngiven year, the sum of the prior year used for computing the growth rate \nexcludes the corresponding country data. Data for Myanmar and Nauru \nare excluded from the computation of all subregional averages/totals.\n\nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A7. These tables show related data on \noutput growth, production, and demand. Changes to the national income \naccounts series for some countries have been made owing to a change \nin source, methodology and/or base year. The series for Bhutan, reflects \nfiscal rather than calendar year data, while those for Timor-Leste reflects \nnon-oil, non-United Nations GDP. \n\nTable A1: Growth rate of GDP (% per year). The table shows annual \n\ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, or \nbasic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of the value added \nof all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes less subsidies \non imports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar taxes. Constant \nfactor cost measures differ from market price measures in that they \nexclude taxes on production and include subsidies. Basic price valuation \nis the factor cost plus some taxes on production, such as property and \npayroll taxes, and less some subsidies, such as labor-related subsidies but \nnot product-related subsidies. Most countries use constant market price \nvaluation. Fiji, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka use constant factor costs, \nwhile Maldives and Nepal use basic prices. \n\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is defined as GDP \nat constant prices divided by the population. The series for most of the \nPacific countries were revised due to a change in source of population \ndata.\tData\ton\tper\tcapita\tgross\tnational\tproduct\tin\tUS$\tterms\tfor\t2009,\t\nsourced from the World Bank, World Development Indicators online, are \nalso shown. Per capita GNP for Cook Islands and Tuvalu are estimated \nbased on derived GNI data, while those for Hong Kong, China and \nTaipei,China refer to 2008.\n\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (% per year). \n\nThe table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture and \nits corresponding share in 2009. The agriculture sector comprises \nagricultural crops, livestock, poultry, fisheries, and forestry.\n\nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year). \nThe table provides the growth rates of value added in industry and its \ncorresponding share in 2009. This sector comprises manufacturing, \nmining and quarrying, construction, and utilities. However, construction \nin Uzbekistan is included in the services sector.\n\nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (% per year). The \n\ntable gives the growth rates of value added in services, as well as its \ncorresponding share in 2009. Subsectors generally include trade, banking, \nfinance, real estate, public administration, and other services.\n\nTable A6: Unemployment rate (%). The unemployment rate is the \npercentage of the labor force that actively seeks work but is unable to find \nwork at a given time. The age of the working population ranges from 15 to \n65, except for Bangladesh where the labor force covers those aged 10 and \n\n\f246    Statistical appendix\n\nabove. The unemployment rates of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand Viet Nam refer to unemployment in urban areas only.\n\nTable A7: Gross domestic investment (% of GDP). This table provides \n\nthe ratio of gross domestic investment (GDI) to GDP. GDI is the sum \nof gross fixed capital formation plus changes in inventories. Gross \nfixed capital formation is measured by the total value of a producer\u2019s \nacquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets in a given accounting period. \nAdditions to the value of nonproduced assets, e.g., land, form part of \ngross fixed capital formation. Inventories are stocks of goods held by \ninstitutional units to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in \nproduction and sales. For India, GDI includes valuables and errors and \nomissions.\n\nTable A8: Inflation (% per year). Data on inflation rates represent \n\nperiod averages. Except for India, which reports the wholesale price \nindex, inflation rates presented are based on consumer price indexes. \nThe consumer price indexes of the following countries are for a given \ncity or group of consumers only: Afghanistan is for Kabul, Cambodia \nis for Phnom Penh, Marshall Islands is for Majuro, Solomon Islands \nis for Honiara, Timor-Leste is for Dili region, and Nepal is for urban \nconsumers. \n\nTable A9: Growth in money supply (% per year). This table tracks the \nannual percentage change in the end-of-period supply of broad money as \nrepresented by M2 (for most countries). M2 is defined as the sum of M1 \nand quasi-money where M1 denotes currency in circulation plus demand \ndeposits and quasi-money consists of time and savings deposits including \nforeign currency deposits.\n\nTables A10, A12, A13, A14, A15, and A16: Balance of payments. \nThis set of tables shows selected international economic transactions of \ncountries as recorded in the balance of payments (BOP). These items \ncover annual flows, except for some countries which show data as of a \nspecified period only. \n\nTables A10 and A12: Growth rates of merchandise exports and \nimports (% per year). The annual growth rates of exports and imports, \nin terms of merchandise goods only, are shown in these tables. Data \nare\tin\tmillion\tUS$,\tprimarily\tobtained\tfrom\tthe\tbalance-of-payments\t\naccounts of each country. Exports are reported on a free-on-board (f.o.b.) \nbasis. Import data are generally reported on an f.o.b. basis, except for \nAfghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, the \nPhilippines, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, and Thailand, which \nvalue them on a cost, insurance, freight (c.i.f.) basis. \n\nTable A11: Direction of exports (% of total). This table shows the \nexports of developing Asian economies. Data are sourced from IMF, \nDirection of Trade and Statistics, CD-ROM (February  2011), except for \nTaipei,China, which were sourced from CEIC Data Company, Ltd. This \ntable shows the percentage share of exports of each economy to other \neconomies in developing Asia excluding the PRC; PRC only; US; Japan; \nEuropean Union (EU); and others (or rest of the world). Exports to the \nrest of the world are derived as total exports to the world minus exports \namong themselves, and to US, Japan, and EU.\n\nTable A13: Trade balance (US$ million). The trade balance is the \ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. \n\n\fStatistical appendix    247\n\nFigures in this table are based on the exports and imports levels used to \ngenerate Tables A10 and A12.\n\nTable A14: Current account balance (US$ million). The current \naccount balance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, net \ntrade in services and factor income, and net transfers. In the case of \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, official transfers are excluded \nfrom the current account balance.\n\nTable A15: Current account balance (% of GDP). The values reported \n\nin\tTable\t14\tare\tdivided\tby\tGDP\tat\tcurrent\tprices\tin\tUS$.\n\nTable A16: Foreign direct investment (US$ million). Foreign direct \ninvestment refers to equity capital, reinvested earnings, investment in \ndebt securities, and other capital associated with the transactions of \nthe enterprises, net of repatriations and intercompany loan repayments. \nFor the PRC, foreign direct investment refers to investments of \nforeign enterprises, economic organizations, and individuals through \njoint ventures and cooperation; reinvested earnings; and enterprises\u2019 \nborrowings from abroad under approved investment projects. For \nCambodia, this refers to foreign investments to the economy. The 2010 \ndata for India and Tajikistan are based on  estimates.\n\nTable A17: External debt outstanding (US$ million). For most \neconomies, external debt outstanding\u2014public and private\u2014includes \nmedium- and long-term debt, short-term debt, and IMF credit. For \nCambodia, Georgia, and the Lao PDR, only public external debt \nis reported. For Azerbaijan; India; Kyrgyz Republic; Malaysia, the \nPhilippines; and Singapore the figures for 2010 are as of end-September.\nTable A18: Debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and services). \n\nThis table generally presents the total debt service payments of each \neconomy, which comprise principal repayments (excluding on short-term \ndebt) and interest payments on outstanding external debt, as a percentage \nof exports of goods and services. For Cambodia and the Lao PDR, \ndebt service refers to external public debt only. For Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa, and Viet Nam, exports of goods are used as the denominator \nin the calculation of the ratio; for the Philippines, exports of goods, \nservices, and income are used as the denominator. For Bangladesh, the \nratio represents debt service payments on medium- and long-term loans \nas a percentage of exports of goods, nonfactor services, and workers\u2019 \nremittances; while for Azerbaijan, the ratio represents public and publicly \nguaranteed external debt service payments as a percentage of exports of \ngoods and nonfactor services. \n\nTable A19: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average). The \n\nannual average exchange rates of each economy are quoted in local \ncurrencies per US dollar. The rate for 2009 for India is for the period \n1 April 2010\u201318 March 2011. \n\nTable A20: Gross international reserves (US$ million). Gross \n\ninternational\treserves\tare\tdefined\tas\tthe\tUS$\tvalue\tof\tholdings\tof\tforeign\t\nexchange, special drawing rights (SDR), reserve position in the IMF, and \ngold at the end of a given period. For Turkmenistan, gold is excluded \nin the computation. For Marshall Islands; Samoa; Solomon Islands; \nTaipei,China; Tonga; and Vanuatu, this heading refers to foreign exchange \nreserves only. In some countries, the rubric comprises foreign assets and \nreserves of national monetary authorities and national oil funds, i.e., \n\n\f248    Statistical appendix\n\nforeign assets of the Maldives Monetary Authority, net foreign reserves of \nthe State Bank of Pakistan, assets of the National Oil Fund of Azerbaijan, \nand official external assets of Kiribati. The data for India are as of \n11 March 2011.\n\nTables A21, A22, and A23: Government finance. This set of tables \nrefers to the revenue and expenditure transactions as well as the fiscal \nbalance of the central government expressed as a percentage of GDP in \nnominal terms. For Cambodia (since 2006), PRC, India, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Tajikistan, transactions are those \nreported by the general government. For the Republic of Korea, \ngovernment revenues exclude social security contributions.\n\nTable A21: Central government expenditures (% of GDP). Central \n\ngovernment expenditures comprise all nonrepayable payments to both \ncurrent and capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts are \ncomputed as a share of GDP at current prices. For Thailand, expenditures \nrefer to budgetary expenditures excluding externally financed \nexpenditures and corresponding borrowing; while that for Tajikistan \nincludes externally financed public investment programs. One-time \nexpenditures are excluded for Pakistan.\n\nTable A22: Central government revenues (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment revenues comprise all nonrepayable receipts, both current \nand capital, plus grants. These amounts are computed as a percentage of \nGDP at current prices. For the Republic of Korea, revenues incorporate \nthe repayment on government-guaranteed debts but exclude social \nsecurity contributions. For Singapore, revenues refer to receipts credited \nto the three accounts listed for the previous table, including investment \nincome, capital receipts, and investment adjustments. Grants are excluded \nin Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand; revenues \nfrom disinvestment are included for India; only current revenues are \nincluded for Bangladesh; and grants and privatization proceeds are \nexcluded for Sri Lanka. For Cambodia, the proceeds of the IMF debt \nrelief program are reflected in their revenues for 2006.\n\nTable A23: Fiscal balance of central government (% of GDP). Fiscal \n\nbalance is the difference between central government revenues and \nexpenditures. The difference is also computed as a share of GDP at \ncurrent prices. Data variations may arise due to statistical discrepancies, \ne.g., balancing items for both central and local governments, and \ndifferences in the concept used in the individual computations of \nrevenues and expenditures as compared with the calculation of the fiscal \nbalance. For Thailand, the fiscal balance is a cash balance composed of \nthe budgetary and nonbudgetary balances. Some off-budget accounts are \nincluded in the computation of the fiscal balance for Turkmenistan.\n\n\fStatistical appendix    249\n\nTable A1  Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\nCentral Asia\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz Republic\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEast Asia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\nMongolia\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nBrunei Darussalam\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Policy makers \nin the region now have to face the challenge of managing inflation pressures. These are \nbeing pushed by rising demand from the swift regional rebound and resurgent international \ncommodity prices.\n\nLooking ahead, the region must develop new avenues to sustain its growth over the long \nterm. Tapping the potential of dynamic emerging markets through stronger \u201cSouth\u2013South\u201d \neconomic links could create new growth drivers\u2014which not only help widen developing \nAsia\u2019s avenues of growth, but also contribute to a more balanced global economy.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. \nDespite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: \n1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than \n$1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.  \n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/publications\nISBN 978-92-9092-285-8\nISSN 0117-0481\nPublication Stock No. FLS112948\n\nPrinted on recycled paper\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ASIAN DEVELOPMENT\n", "Outlook\n2011\n", "South\u2013South Economic  Links\n", "Asian Development Bank\n", "\u00a9 2011 Asian Development Bank\n", "All rights reserved.
