The Asian Development Outlook 2011 shows \nthat the region\u2019s recovery from the recent global economic downturn is \nfirming with growth expected to reach nearly 8% in 2011 and 2012. This \ncontinued high growth follows the 9% expansion from the trough of the \ncrisis.\nThe consolidation of the global recovery is, however, uneven. While \ndeveloping Asia\u2014and the economies of \u201cthe South\u201d in general\u2014have \nrecouped the ground lost during the global downturn, the major \nindustrial countries are progressing modestly. After the 2.6% rebound last \nyear, the three economies of the United States, eurozone, and Japan are \ncollectively expected to expand by 2.1% in 2011 and 2012. \nAlthough the risk of these economies falling back into recession is \nreceding, even this modest industrial-country recovery is fraught with \nrisks. Tensions in the Middle East are pushing up oil prices. Japan is \ncoping with the tragedy of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Labor \nand housing market weaknesses are holding back recovery in the United \nStates. The eurozone has not fully resolved the sovereign debt problems in \nits periphery. \nThe Asian Development Outlook 2011 emphasizes two important \nchallenges that developing Asia must resolve to sustain the inclusive \ngrowth that is needed to eliminate poverty in the region. The immediate \nproblem is tackling rising consumer price pressures. Inflation\u2019s insidious \neffects call for preemptive action to contain it before it begins to \naccelerate. The poor are the most vulnerable, particularly from rising food \nprices. \nManaging inflation is not easy. Because of the faster recovery, \ndemand pressures are more intense in the region than among the major \nindustrial economies. The recent surges in global oil and food prices are \nadding further pressures. Even though steps have been taken to reduce \nprice pressures, inflation in the region is expected to pick up to 5.3% \nthis year. Many countries may already be behind the curve in fighting \ninflation, and some countries are showing signs of overheating. The task \nis complicated because lifting interest rates may induce foreign capital \ninflows, which can add to price pressures. \nGetting the policy response right depends on the problem. Where \ncurrent account surpluses persist and exchange rates are misaligned with \nfundamentals, more flexible exchange rates may be the best option. For \nother economies, monetary tightening may be coupled with temporary \ncapital controls, which should be coordinated internationally.\nThe second challenge is fostering new sources to sustain the region\u2019s \ngrowth into the future. In this regard, the trend of growing trade and \ninvestment with other developing countries\u2014so-called South\u2013South \nlinks\u2014is encouraging. The share of world merchandise trade among ", "countries in the South has more than doubled in less than two decades, \nfrom 7% in 1990 to 17% in 2009. \nMuch of the rise in trade and investment between economies in the \nSouth can be accounted for by the rise of \u201cfactory Asia\u201d\u2014where parts \nand components move across borders in the region but the assembled \nfinal goods are exported to major industrial-country markets. Thus while \ndeveloping Asia is at the forefront of the South\u2019s emerging economic \ninfluence, current production arrangements are still, ultimately, highly \ndependent on the North.\nAt a time of modest growth in industrial countries, improved \nSouth\u2013South relations can be a potential new driver for global growth. \nFortunately, there is considerable scope to deepen economic links \nwithin the South, but these will not come automatically. To fully tap the \npotential of these markets as new sources of growth, policy makers must \nremove impediments to South\u2013South trade and investment, which are \nstill higher than those with the North; and much work needs to be done \nto reduce barriers within the South to promote global integration.\nAs South\u2013South ties evolve, developing Asia can draw on insights \nstemming from its success in its own regional cooperation and \nintegration\u2014both for itself and for other regions of the world. These ties \nare supported by the Asian Development Bank as an effective approach to \neliminate poverty.\nHaruhiko Kuroda\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank", "Acknowledgments\nThe Asian Development Outlook2011 was prepared by the staff of the \nAsian Development Bank from the Central and West Asia Department, \nEast Asia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, \nSoutheast Asia Department, Economics and Research Department, as well \nas the resident missions.

The region is \nforecast to grow by 7.8% in 2011 and 7.7% in 2012. \nIt faces two critical challenges to maintain inclusive growth in \nthe years ahead. The most immediate is responding to swelling \ninflation pressures, which can be complicated by subsequent \ncapital inflows. Policy makers will need to maintain a coherent \npolicy mix to ensure success here. \nFurther ahead, the region must explore and then foster new \nsources of growth. The strengthening of ties with developing \ncountries, both in the region and beyond, has much potential, \nbut so far these links have been mainly used for final goods \nexports to major industrial countries. \nTo fully tap the potential of these developing-country markets \nas new sources of growth, policy makers must remove barriers \nto \u201cSouth\u2013South\u201d trade and investment, which are still higher \nthan those with the industrial world.", "x    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\nKey messages\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s recovery is firming. Its high growth is expected to continue \ndespite the modest recovery in the major industrial economies. The region is \nforecast to grow by 7.8% in 2011 and 7.7% in 2012. In order to maintain sustainable \nand inclusive growth, however, Asia must confront two important challenges.\n\u2022\nFirst, on the immediate horizon, is coping with rising inflation pressures. \nDeveloping Asia\u2019s swift turnaround from the crisis provided the impetus for rising \nconsumer prices. Tensions in the Middle East and the nuclear anxieties in Japan \nhave further lifted market expectations of higher oil prices. Consumer price \ninflation in the region is forecast to rise to 5.3% in 2011, and some economies are \nshowing signs of potential overheating.\n\u2022\nAlthough inflation is generally still low, regional policy makers need to make \npreemptive management of inflation a top priority. Developing Asia is home \nto two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor, and it is they who are the most vulnerable to \nits effects. Maintaining a coherent policy mix is key to success since monetary \ntightening to curb inflation pressures is likely to invite an increase in foreign capital \ninflows, which would compound the problems of managing inflation.\n\u2022\nMore flexible exchange rates may be a better policy for countries with persistent \ncurrent account imbalances and misalignment between their exchange rate and \nfundamentals. For countries without such symptoms, relying more on temporary \npolicies, such as capital controls, may be an option if they are carried out in an \ninternationally coordinated manner.\n\u2022\nThe second challenge is to find and contribute to new sources of sustainable \nglobal growth. Industrial countries are unlikely to drive global growth any time \nsoon and the economies of the South\u2014developing Asia, Africa, Latin America, and \nthe Middle East\u2014should take up the slack.\n\u2022\nIt is encouraging that South\u2013South economic links are strengthening and \ncontributing to the recovery of the world\u2019s economy. South\u2013South trade has \nexpanded fast in the past two decades, from about 7% of nonfuel world merchandise \ntrade in 1990 to 17% in 2009. Foreign direct investment (FDI) links have also increased \nhugely as high-saving Southern economies have become new sources of outward FDI.\n\u2022\nThis strengthening does not, however, guarantee sustainable growth for Asia. \nMuch of it was the result of the rise of \u201cfactory Asia,\u201d where developing Asia sourced \nintermediate goods and parts from within Asia to assemble them into final goods to \nbe exported to affluent markets in the North. Hence growing South\u2013South links do \nnot necessarily translate into greater economic independence from the North.\n\u2022\nStrengthening South\u2013South links through recycling savings to finance investment \n(rather than holding them in safe assets) could enhance the growth potential of \nthe South and contribute to the stability of the global economy by promoting \nglobal rebalancing. To do that, the South has to work hard to reduce internal trade \nand investment barriers\u2014still higher than those with the North\u2014and continue to \npromote global and regional integration.", "Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xi\nMuted Industrial-country Upswing\n\u2022\nRecovery is progressing modestly in the major industrial economies. In 2010, \nthe gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States, eurozone, and Japan \ntogether expanded by a respectable 2.6% (partly due to the effect of the lower \nbase from the downturn). Yet it is still unclear whether private demand can \nsustain growth once authorities start to normalize fiscal and monetary policies. \nConsequently, their GDP is forecast to expand at a somewhat slower pace than \nthe initial rebound: 2.1% in both 2011 and 2012. Despite rising global commodity \nprices and accommodative monetary policy, industrial-country inflation remains \nlow due to their slower growth prospects.\n\u2022\nGlobal uncertainties pose risks to maintaining their growth momentum, \nhowever.\n\u00bb\nThe recent surge in oil prices could undermine the global recovery, and \ngeopolitical and other factors have heightened uncertainty about future \nprices. Political instability in the Middle East raises questions about oil \nsupplies, while Japan\u2019s nuclear energy woes have heightened concerns about \nthis alternative energy source. Food prices hit records in February 2011. While \ncore inflation remains low in industrial countries, oil and food price pressures \ncan fuel inflation in developing countries where recovery is well under way.\n\u00bb\nDespite the mild recovery that is forecast (2.8% in 2011 and 2.6% in 2012), the \nUnited States economy is beset by stubbornly high unemployment and weak \nhousing markets. These undermine the strength of the economy, and thus the \nglobal outlook.\n\u00bb\nSovereign debt problems in the eurozone periphery still await a fundamental \nresolution, which could jeopardize the 1.6% growth forecast for both 2011 \nand 2012. Further problems may precipitate financial instability within \nthe eurozone\u2014which could even spread globally. Inflation and global \ngeopolitical uncertainty can increase borrowing costs, further aggravating the \nfiscal problems in the single-currency bloc.\n\u00bb\nJapan\u2019s economy is slowing after its rebound from the recession, and it must \nnow face the challenges arising from one of the most destructive natural \ndisasters in its history. The short-run economic impacts from the supply \ndisruptions and power shortages could be substantial, but the long-run \nprognosis is less dire. Through reconstruction efforts and the return of \nproductive activity, the economy is forecast to grow by 1.5% in 2011 and 1.8% \nin 2012.", "xii    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s Outlook\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s recovery is firming. The region is projected to grow \nby 7.8% in 2011 and 7.7% in 2012. The moderation from 9.0% in 2010 stems \nfrom slower growth of the major industrial economies and world trade \nas well as normalization of fiscal and monetary policy. The exceptional \nperformance of 2010 was partly due to the base effect, as the region \nbounced back from the impact of the global downturn. The moderation \nmarks a welcome return to growth rates that can be sustained without \nstoking inflation.\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s robust growth provided timely support during \nthe crisis and recovery. The region\u2019s resilience has contributed to \nthe recovery of both industrial economies and non-Asian developing \ncountries, primarily via the trade channel. Even as global trade collapsed, \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s imports continued to grow. Rapid growth in the region\u2019s \ntwo giants\u2014the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India\u2014will continue \nto lift regional and global growth. The medium-term outlook for both is \ngood, although finance sector risks in the PRC and the fiscal consolidation \nin India need to be addressed.\n\u2022\nThe current account surplus is falling and projected to decline further.\nRising commodity prices, especially for oil, and the region\u2019s strong GDP \ngrowth are raising its imports. The current account surplus fell from 4.7% \nof GDP in 2009 to 4.1% in 2010. Under the forecasts for even higher oil \nprices with continued strong growth, the region\u2019s current account balance \nis forecast to fall further to 3.3% of GDP in 2011 and 3.0% in 2012. Yet \nthis should not be interpreted as an unwinding of the structural global \nimbalances.\n\u2022\nInflation pressures are building, and preemptive measures may well \nbe needed to avoid overheating. Inflation has risen more sharply in \nthe region than in the major industrial countries. Consumer prices rose \nby 4.4% in 2010, accelerating from 1.2% in 2009, on a combination of \nexternal factors (global oil and food price shocks) and the robust domestic \nrecovery. Although many central banks have already taken action, inflation \nis expected to accelerate further to 5.3% in 2011 before tapering off to 4.6% \nin 2012.\n\u2022\nRising oil and food prices could shake developing Asia\u2019s \nmacroeconomic stability. Model simulations show that a 30% increase in \nboth oil and food prices over their 2010 levels could shave 0.7 percentage \npoints from the region\u2019s forecast growth and add 1.7 percentage \npoints to its inflation rate. An oil price shock has the bigger impact on \nmacroeconomic stability, but rising food prices disproportionately affect \nthe poor.", "Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xiii\n\u2022\nThe need to take preemptive action on inflation is building in \ndeveloping Asia.\n\u00bb\nDemand pressure in some Asian economies is more intense than in the \nadvanced countries. Growing demand pressures can put strains on the \nlabor market, potentially inducing a wage\u2013inflation spiral.\n\u00bb\nInflation undermines the promotion of inclusive growth through its \neffects on poverty and inequality. Its impact, particularly if driven by food \nprices, increases the number of poor since the region\u2019s consumption \nbaskets tend to have larger shares of food than those in the advanced \neconomies. This widens income inequality and could potentially lead to \nsocial tensions.\n\u00bb\nAuthorities have started responding to inflation, but some may be behind \nthe curve. So far, Asian economies have either allowed their currencies \nto appreciate or have imposed tariff-relief measures to curb imported \ninflation (with varying results). They have also tightened monetary policy \nto manage the growing demand pressures, but some countries are still \nshowing signs of overheating.\n\u2022\nManaging inflation pressure is not easy. The policy mix needs to be \ncoherent.\n\u00bb\nIncreasing benchmark policy rates would prompt wider interest \ndifferentials, and so attract more volatile capital inflows.\n\u00bb\nLetting currencies appreciate more flexibly is one option, but may not be \nappealing for those who favor maintaining international competitiveness. \nIntervening in the foreign exchange markets is not an alternative, \nhowever. The intervention may not be globally acceptable and could be \nself-defeating as it potentially worsens domestic inflation pressures.\n\u00bb\nImposing selective and carefully designed temporary capital control \nmeasures on inflows might be another option. To be effective, however, \nsuch measures require high degrees of administrative capacity to \nimplement and should only be exercised temporarily.\n\u2022\nAppropriate policies to deal with inflation and capital inflows depend on \nthe specific problem. More flexible exchange rates may be a better policy \nfor countries with persistent current account imbalances and misalignment \nbetween the exchange rate and fundamentals. For countries without such \nsymptoms, relying more on temporary policies, such as capital controls, \ncan be an option if executed in an internationally coordinated manner. \nG20\u2019s recent efforts to establish practical indicative guidelines for assessing \ncountries\u2019 current account imbalances and principles for capital controls \ncould provide useful tools.", "xiv    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\nOutlook by Subregion\n\u2022\nEast Asia will grow most rapidly in developing Asia. Led by the PRC, \naggregate subregional GDP growth will moderate somewhat from its 9.6% \nrecovery pace in 2010 to 8.4% in 2011 and 8.1% in 2012. Slower investment \n(from the winding down of policy stimulus) and less-heated export growth \nwill temper GDP expansion in the PRC\u2014from the 10.3% recovery to 9.6% \nin 2011 and 9.2% in 2012. Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and \nTaipei,China will settle back to more sustainable growth of around 5% after \ntheir sharp 2010 rebound. Most East Asian economies are moving toward a \ntighter monetary stance as their production levels reach their potential and \nrising commodity prices add pressure. Inflation in the subregion is forecast to \npick up in 2011 to 4.3% (from 3.1% in 2010) before easing back to 3.9% in 2012.\n\u2022\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s expansion will moderate after its exceptionally strong \nrecovery. Growth is expected to step down in light of the higher 2010 \nbase (from 7.8% growth that year), a slowing in export growth, and policy \ntightening by governments. GDP will expand by 5.5% in 2011 and 5.7% in \n2012. This moderation is most notable in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nand Thailand, which grew rapidly during the recovery. The region is also \nplaying its part in rebalancing growth toward private domestic demand, as \nseen in the increased investment rate in Indonesia. Inflation in Southeast \nAsia is accelerating from its moderate rate of 4.0% in 2010 to 5.1% in 2011. \nInflation pressures have been more tenacious in some countries\u2014Viet \nNam, for example, is expected to hit double digits. With appropriate policy \nresponses, Southeast Asia\u2019s average inflation is expected to come down to \n4.2% in 2012.\n\u2022\nSouth Asia\u2019s GDP is expanding steadily. After growing by 7.9% in 2010 \nin line with the global recovery, growth will continue steadily, at 7.5% in \n2011 and 8.1% in 2012. Leading the subregion, India\u2019s 2010 expansion was \nrobust and broad-based (8.6%)\u2014even in the face of fiscal consolidation and \nsubstantial monetary tightening\u2014and is set to remain strong at 8.2% in \n2011 and 8.8% in 2012. Pakistan\u2019s floods weighed on its growth in 2011, but \nSri Lanka\u2019s peace dividend continues to support its expansion. Food price \npressures in India pushed inflation in South Asia to 9.3% in 2010, although \nthat country\u2019s sharp monetary tightening should help bring the subregional \naverage inflation rate down to 8.7% in 2011 and 7.3% in 2012.", "Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xv\n\u2022\nCentral Asia is benefiting from higher international commodity prices.\nMuch higher prices for the region\u2019s key exports (oil and gas, metals, cotton, \nand gold) supported the recovery (6.6% in 2010) and will stay important \ndrivers. Growth is set to rise slightly to 6.7% in 2011 and 6.9% in 2012. \nFollowing its V-shaped recovery, Kazakhstan will slow somewhat from the \nhigher base as it winds down its anticrisis measures. The non-oil economies \nstrengthened with the economic revival in the Russian Federation (their main \nsource of remittances, trade, and finance). Inflation across the subregion is \nexpected to average 8.2% in 2011, up from 7.1% in 2010, driven by higher \nfood prices in all countries and higher energy prices in the oil importers. \nModeration in food prices in 2012 will provide some relief, and inflation \nshould ease to 6.6%.\n\u2022\nResource-rich economies will drive growth in the Pacific. Most of the \n6.3% growth forecast in 2011 is attributable to the resource-rich economies \nof Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Solomon Islands, which are \nbenefiting from higher global commodity prices, new investment, and \nhigher government revenue from resources. While income from tourism and \nremittances generally picked up in step with the global recovery, most small \nPacific economies are projected to grow only slowly (2% or less). Growth for \nthe subregion should settle back to 5.4% in 2012.

The \nemergence of the G20 summit reflects a belated response to this reality.\n\u2022\nConcurrent with high growth, South\u2013South links have proliferated.\nTrade and financial integration in the South have intensified in tandem with \nits rising global economic role. Greater integration allows the economies \nof the South to share experiences and to learn from each other. As there is \nno single model for development, it is imperative for countries to diversify \nsources of knowledge and share development experiences. As well as North\u2013\nSouth knowledge exchanges, South\u2013South knowledge sharing is becoming \na reality.\n\u2022\nSouth\u2013South links are creating new potential drivers of aggregate \ndemand. Given their reversals in the recent crisis, industrial economies are \nunlikely to drive demand in the world economy any time soon. With their \nstrong prospects for growth, the economies of the South should take up the \nslack. Potentially, the rising consumption of emerging economies and the \nnew investment flows within the South can be new sources of growth for the \nworld economy\u2014but only if the economies of the South become more open \nto trade and capital flows.\nExpanding South\u2013South economic links through trade\n\u2022\nSouth\u2013South trade has shot up in the past two decades. Trade among \nSouthern countries rose from about 7% of world nonfuel merchandise trade \nin 1990 to 17% in 2009. Developing Asia now accounts for about three-\nquarters of South\u2013South trade, and the PRC alone for roughly 40%.\n\u2022\nThe rise of factory Asia explains most of the rise of South\u2013South trade. \nIntermediate goods are sourced mainly within the region, including Japan, \nfor assembly in the PRC, the regional hub. Final goods are then exported, \npredominantly to affluent markets in the North.\n\u2022\nSouth\u2013South trade has grown rapidly for Latin America, Africa, and the \nMiddle East. Although these regions\u2019 trade with the South is relatively small, \nat roughly one-quarter of South\u2013South trade, it has been quickly expanding, \nparticularly with Asia.", "Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011    xvii\n\u2022\nTariff levels and other barriers to trade in the South have tumbled in \nthe past two decades, but are still higher than with the North. As a \n2005\u20132008 average, applied tariffs in the South were 9.3%, compared with \n3.2% in the North. Trade-related infrastructure and logistics performance, as \nmeasured by World Bank surveys, shows that the South lags far behind the \nNorth, although it has been closing the gap.\n\u2022\nA gradual removal of these remaining bottlenecks would especially spur \nSouth\u2013South trade, where they tend to hold back trade on both sides.\nSimulation analysis suggests that lowering tariff barriers to South\u2013South \ntrade even to the levels prevailing in South\u2013North trade could bring three-\nquarters of the gains to Southern countries of freeing all countries\u2019 goods \ntrade. South\u2013South trade would expand by 6 percentage points as a result. \nHowever, trade reforms supporting South\u2013South trade must not undermine \ncontinuing global integration. In view of the proliferation of regional trade \nagreements in Asia and elsewhere, it is increasingly important that future \nagreements be made as inclusive as possible and ensure compatibility with \nprovisions of the World Trade Organization.\nExpanding South\u2013South economic links through investment\n\u2022\nIn developing Asia, FDI is by far the most important source of capital \nfrom abroad. Developing Asia received an average of $187 billion in FDI \neach year during the last two decades, which far exceeded the average \nannual combined flows of $126 billion in portfolio and bank investments. \nThe importance of FDI is even clearer given its resilience to external \nshocks, hence serving as a stable source of financial resources to Southern \neconomies.\n\u2022\nSouthern countries became sources of outward FDI in the 2000s. Most \nFDI is among Northern countries, but the share of the South has grown \nfast. By 2009, about a quarter of global inward FDI stocks and about 13% for \noutward FDI stocks were in the South. Developing Asia accounts for more \nthan 70% of developing countries\u2019 outward FDI stocks.\n\u2022\nAs part of the deepening of factory Asia production networks, Asian FDI \nhas become more intraregional. Over half the inflows to developing Asia \nare estimated to be regional. The concentration is especially high in East Asia \nand Southeast Asia, stimulated by regional integration efforts, expansion of \nproduction networks, and relocation of production to lower-cost areas within \nthe region.", "xviii    Highlights\u2014Asian Development Outlook 2011\nUpgrading South\u2013South links is key to Asian and global growth\n\u2022\nSouth\u2013South links can be a new source of global growth, but to \nmaximize potential, structural weaknesses must be overcome. Growing \nSouth\u2013South relations at a time of modest growth in industrial economies \ncould be a potential new driver of global growth. However, this trend does \nnot guarantee sustainable growth for Asia and the global economy, since \nit stems from the rise of factory Asia. Growing South\u2013South links do not \ntherefore necessarily mean greater economic independence from the North.\n\u2022\nThe potential for tighter South\u2013South integration is strong. The industrial \nmigration associated with South\u2013South FDI helps to enhance the growth \npotential and productive capacity of host Southern economies by filling \ninvestment gaps. Developing Asia could contribute to this if it were to \nrecycle its saving to finance investment in the South (rather than hold it \nin safe assets). Such a move could contribute to the stability of the global \neconomy by promoting rebalancing. It would also encourage regional \nfinancial-market deepening. But the South has to reduce its trade and \ninvestment barriers, which are still high relative to those with the North, to \npromote global and regional integration.\n\u2022\nSigns of progress are positive in international cooperation for South\u2013\nSouth links.

The strong economic recovery \n(boosting demand for food) and rising oil prices (raising input costs) also \nplayed a role.\nStructural factors that are driving long-term demand trends also \ncome into play in the current price surge.

The outlook for rice \nis more uncertain but upward pressures will persist if La Ni\u00f1a weather \nconditions continue to affect production. \nRisks to the global outlook\nAlthough the global recovery is showing signs of firming, it is still uneven \nand laden with risks. The risks to the outlook for the major industrial \ncountries differ, but weakness in one could undermine recovery in the \nothers\u2014and have spillover effects globally. Developing countries are more \nsusceptible to instability originating from rising commodity prices, and \nfor those developing countries that have bounced back fastest from the \nrecent downturn, overheating is a growing concern. \nPersistent weakness of labor and housing markets in the United States\nThe health of the US economy has a strong impact on the global economy. \nThe immediate prospects for the country have brightened somewhat with \nthe support of monetary and fiscal stimulus, but it is still unclear whether \nprivate demand is strong enough to stand on its own. Persistent weakness \nof the labor and housing markets in particular are a drag on private \nconsumption and investment. \nDespite unemployment falling to 8.9% in February, without more ", "Asia in the uneven global recovery     17\nsustained progress, uncertainty over jobs will continue to damp consumer \nconfidence and hold back consumption. A weak housing market inhibits \nhouseholds from repairing their balance sheets, and may also prevent \nworkers from moving to more promising locations for jobs.\nSovereign debt risk in the eurozone\nThe sovereign debt problems pose a serious downside risk for \ninternational financial markets. The wide spreads between 10-year \ngovernment-bond yields for Germany and for peripheral countries\u2014\nGreece and Ireland in particular\u2014show that the markets have real \ndoubts about these two countries\u2019 fiscal sustainability. Although the \nEU and IMF averted a crisis in 2010, the risk of disorderly debt crisis \nremains. \nThese two economies are small, but crisis in either of them could \njeopardize the financial stability of the eurozone, the EU, and beyond, \ngiven the substantial financial links between them and the eurozone\u2019s \ncore economies. Such disruptions have the potential to spill over into \nglobal financial markets as well.\nUncertain aftermath of the disaster in Japan\nIt is premature to gauge the full economic impact of the huge \nearthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on 11 March 2011, either for \nJapan or the rest of the world. The effects of such natural disasters \nare typically large in the short run, when production is disrupted and \nprivate consumption suffers. Given the role of Japanese firms in global \nproduction networks, supply-chain disruptions could impede growth \nelsewhere, particularly where suitable replacements are not readily \navailable. In the longer run, government reconstruction programs will \nhelp to revive private investment. \nThe benign baseline scenario of quick normalization assumes \nthat there will be no major aftershocks, extended power shortages, or \nwidespread radiation contamination (discussed further in Box 1.2.2 \nbelow).\nFiscal risks in industrial economies\nFiscal risks manifest themselves differently in the eurozone, US, and \nJapan. Those eurozone peripheral countries facing mounting concerns \nover their sovereign debt are pursuing austerity programs to improve \ntheir public finances. While such programs are necessary to avert default \nand bolster market confidence, they act as a drag on economic activity (as \nseen in Greece\u2019s shocking contraction). The slowdown of growth may then \nhit tax revenue and worsen the fiscal position in the short run. \nIn the US and Japan, fiscal risks stem from failure to develop \nmedium-term consolidation plans. Both countries face a dilemma, \nbecause the fragility of their recoveries calls for a continued \naccommodative fiscal stance. In Japan, the dilemma is further heightened \nby the expected fiscal burden of disaster relief and recovery efforts \nstemming from the earthquake and tsunami. Given the escalation of \npublic debt in both countries, such a failure could erode financial market \nconfidence, which would push up borrowing costs, further exacerbating \nthe problem.", "18    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nHigh and volatile global commodity prices\nThe return of global growth, combined with lack of readily available \nspare production capacity, is driving demand for both oil and food. \nThe narrowing of the gap between demand and potential global supply, \nalong with the erratic recovery of the major industrial countries, will \ncause greater price volatility. The probability of a sustained surge of food \nprices in 2011 remains limited, however, because temporary supply factors \nwere largely in play. Still, the short-term outlook for high and volatile \ncommodity prices will add to inflation pressures, especially in high-\ngrowth developing countries.\nRisk of overheating in fast-growing developing countries\nRobust recovery and growth are giving rise to incipient overheating \nand inflation pressures in some developing countries. Risks here are \nnotably evident in fast-growing developing Asia and are becoming \napparent in other areas, such as parts of Latin America. Capital inflows \nand rising commodity prices may exacerbate asset and consumer price \ninflation. Any failure by policy makers to damp overheating pressures \nwill jeopardize macroeconomic stability and growth. Given the current \ndependence of global growth on developing-country dynamism, this \nwould cloud the global outlook. \nThe global recession may have ended, but its aftereffects linger.

This \ntendency intensifies pressures for further inflation hikes in \nAsia, requiring policy makers to pay greater attention to it. If inflation \nis allowed to accelerate further, it could threaten to derail growth in the \nregion.\nWhy inflation matters for developing Asia\nOne reason why the region should now focus on inflation is the impact \nof rising global commodity prices on domestic prices. The oil price surge \nis a global external shock, largely beyond Asia\u2019s control. Soaring global \noil prices often lead to higher domestic retail fuel prices, and broadly to \nhigher production costs and overall prices. \nThe impact of higher global food prices on overall domestic  1.3.2 Inflation trends, Southeast Asia\nprices can be substantial since food accounts for a large share of  Indonesia Malaysia Philippines\nAsia\u2019s consumption basket (Table 1.2.1 above).

Recent estimates indicate that a 10% increase in \ndomestic food prices would raise the number of poor in developing Asia \nby about 65 million, a 7.2% increase in the number of poor (Box 1.3.1). \nHeightened inflation can thus dilute the region\u2019s hard-won gains in \npoverty reduction.\nBy disproportionately harming the poor, inflation not only worsens \npoverty but can exacerbate inequality (Easterly and Fischer, 2001; Romer \nand Romer, 1998).

This limits their opportunities to engage \nin more productive activities. By narrowing economic opportunities, \nespecially among the poor, inflation can undermine efforts to promote \ninclusive growth, which spreads the benefits of growth to the broader \npopulation.\nHigh inflation is a direct threat to stable and inclusive growth since \nrising domestic prices can lead to social tensions. Indeed, rapidly soaring \ndomestic prices have triggered social unrest in a raft of countries. For \nexample, in 2008 rising soybean prices triggered riots in Indonesia and \nsoaring rice prices in Bangladesh sparked large protests. More recently, \nin December 2010, India was hit by riots over high onion prices. Outside \nAsia, escalating food prices led to riots in Algeria and Tunisia.\nIn the case of the PRC, policy makers recognize high inflation as a \nrisk to building a \u201charmonious society,\u201d a strategic policy shift geared \ntoward spreading the benefits of economic development to maintain \nsocial harmony and stability. The authorities are pushing for more \ninclusive growth against the backdrop of inflation pressures and growing \nsocial problems. Since inflation is a major issue, the country\u2019s Economic \nand Social Development Plan for 2011 will focus on maintaining stable \nprices.\nLooking ahead, there is a growing risk that nominal wage inflation \nwill cause a wage\u2013price spiral in developing Asia.

Other  seem to have been channeled through to Asia.\nPolicy consistency and the dilemma for Asian \npolicy makers\nManaging current inflation pressures is not easy for Asian policy makers. \nIncreasing benchmark policy rates to fend off potential demand pressures \non inflation would prompt wider interest rate differentials between \nAsia and industrial nations, hence potentially attracting further volatile \ncapital inflows. Such inflows would compound the difficulties of handling \ndomestic demand pressures by creating greater liquidity in the system. \nThey would also increase risk of capital reversals that could destabilize \nthe finance sector. \nThe large inflows of capital to Asia will also increase pressure for \nAsian currencies to appreciate. Allowing the exchange rate to adjust \nwould cushion the economy from the effects of excessive capital inflows. \nIn fact, greater exchange rate flexibility is a sustainable response to \na permanent increase in capital inflows by inducing a fundamental \nrevaluation of domestic assets relative to foreign assets. Such flexibility \nintroduces two-way risks for investors, hence potentially discouraging \nspeculative capital inflows. Appreciation also helps fend off inflation \npressures from increases in international commodity prices by keeping \nthe local currency price of these goods down.\nAppreciating their currency, however, may not appeal to policy ", "32    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nmakers who are concerned about the impact it would have on their export \nsector, particularly as the resurgence in exports supported the rapid pace \nof economic recovery in Asia. A unilateral currency appreciation is often \nundesirable since it hurts the export sector immediately by reducing the \neconomy\u2019s international price competitiveness.\nAvoiding appreciation in these circumstances requires policy makers \nto intervene in foreign exchange markets, but this raises two immediate \nissues. First, continued interventions could trigger a \u201ccurrency war,\u201d as \ncountries strive to maintain low exchange rates vis-\u00e0-vis their neighbors. \nSecond, interventions to avoid appreciation could be self-defeating. \nThey will have an expansionary effect on domestic liquidity, hence \nfurther increase domestic inflation pressures, which would also damage \ninternational competitiveness in the longer run through real exchange \nrate appreciation. \nOf course, the authorities may attempt to sterilize the expansionary \ndomestic liquidity effects by reducing the domestic credit component of \ntheir monetary base. Such sterilization is, however, often only effective \nin the short run, difficult to execute, and costly to implement. Foreign \nexchange intervention against nominal appreciation therefore should not \nbe a first-recourse option. \nThe nature of capital inflows is also a reason that Asian policy makers \nmay hold back from relying only on exchange rate appreciation to deal \nwith current inflows. Exchange rate flexibility may be an effective tool \nagainst a sustained surge of capital inflows. But using only this approach \nif the inflows are temporary may involve side effects to the economy. \nAs the flow of capital reverses, the exchange rate will need to adjust to \nthe opposite direction. With temporary capital flows, this implies high-\nfrequency currency fluctuations, creating more problems since they tend \nto invite more speculative attacks. \nImposing selective and carefully designed temporary capital control \nmeasures on inflows may therefore be an option. With such measures \nin place, emerging Asian economies may gain room for managing their \ndomestic inflation without exerting too much pressure on exchange rate \nappreciation. The effectiveness of capital control measures themselves, \nhowever, is debatable. Not only do they require a high degree of \nadministrative capacity to implement, but they also should be exercised \ntemporarily, as they tend to lose their effectiveness over time (Kawai and \nTakagi, 2008).\nThe above discussions provide possible policy responses to dealing \nwith the problem of large capital inflows that is accompanying the quest \nto curb inflation pressures in Asia. Once a country can identify whether \nits influx of capital is permanent or temporary, it can take appropriate \nsteps more easily. Unfortunately, such identification is difficult, so \ncountries will have to decide on the nature of the problem while taking \nthe necessary actions. \nPossible solutions\nThe appropriate policy response for dealing with capital inflows therefore \ndiffers by the specific nature of the problem. The state of a country\u2019s \ncurrent account imbalances and the alignment of its exchange rate with ", "Asia in the uneven global recovery     33\nrespect to its economic fundamentals offer a guideline for determining \nthe appropriate steps.\nLetting the exchange rate move more flexibly to avoid further \ndisruptive capital inflows may be a better policy for countries that have \nundergone persistent current account imbalances and misalignment \nbetween the exchange rate and fundamentals. It may help these countries \nto realign the exchange rate to be more in line with fundamentals, \nhence promoting sustainable economic growth and stability. In contrast, \ncountries without such symptoms may be better relying more on \ntemporary policies, such as capital controls, that fend off excessive capital \ninflows. This policy, however, should not be used permanently as it will be \nunsustainable over the long run.\nHow to measure the extent to which a country falls under each \ncategory is complicated. It is also politically sensitive. No commonly \nagreed measures or guidelines have been developed. This highlights the \nneed for countries to coordinate setting their policies, particularly when \nthey deal with potentially disruptive capital flows. Any unilateral act to \nlet the currency move more flexibly, or even to impose capital controls, \ncan result in an unfavorable situation for the country taking that step, \nhence potentially leading to some kind of \u201cprisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d type of \nsolution.\nFortunately, G20 members have recently started efforts to work \non introducing indicative guidelines that can be used to assess a set \nof indicators, including a country\u2019s current account imbalance by \nconsidering exchange rate and other macroeconomic policies and \nindicators. Such guidelines will be useful for differentiating countries. \nThe guidelines will promote adoption of more appropriate policy by \ncountries dealing with capital flows in a more coordinated manner, hence \npotentially being more effective. Asia has many lessons to offer that would \nbe useful in introducing these practical guidelines.\nRising inflation pressures coupled with potentially destabilizing \ncapital inflows is an immediate challenge facing policy makers in the \nregion. Another issue, though, is how to maintain regional growth in \nlight of expected sluggishness in the major industrial countries. Looking \nto other developing-country markets may be promising.", "34    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nSolid rebound in the non-Asian \ndeveloping world\nThe world economy is in the midst of a two-speed recovery from the \nrecent global crisis\u2014a recovery in which developing countries are rapidly \nrebounding while industrial countries are still struggling to find their \nfeet.

Above all was the turnaround in the external \nenvironment and normalization of global trade. In particular, \nthe sharp rebound in global commodity prices benefited all three \nregions since many countries in the non-Asian developing world are \nmajor commodity exporters. Another common driver of the recovery \nhas been accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, which supported \ndemand and growth. In some countries, an improved policy environment \nfacilitated the stimulus. For example, many Latin American countries \nhave pursued more prudent fiscal and monetary policies since the late \n1980s.\nAt the same time, there were a number of differences across the three \nregions. For example, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East differ \nProjected  GDP growth\nsubstantially in the level of their integration into the global \nfinancial system. This explains why the national financial systems  1.4.2 Projected GDP growth, 2011\u20132012 \nof Africa suffered relatively little damage from the crisis, and  %\n9\nthe region\u2019s financial markets continued to function.

", "Asia in the uneven global recovery     35\nFor the North, in particular the US but also for the EU to some extent, \nthe crisis was an internal financial crisis. These typically have lingering \nadverse effects. Past experience suggests (IMF, 2009) that recessions \ncaused by financial crises tend to be more severe and protracted than \ncrises arising from other shocks.2 At the same time, recovery from \nfinancial crisis\u2013related recessions tends to be slower because private \nconsumption and investment remain depressed longer as firms and \nhouseholds deleverage and rebuild their balance sheets.\nIn contrast, the crisis for the South was largely an external trade \nshock with only temporary effects, primarily on the real economy. For \nsuch a shock, the economy gets back on its feet as soon as external \ndemand recovers. This helps to explain why the South has roared back \nas global trade revived along with the recovery of the world economy. In \nshort, the asymmetric North\u2013South recovery is in part a consequence of \nthe asymmetric nature of the global crisis\u2014financial (North) and trade \n(South).\nThe South\u2019s limited financial links with the North and its consequent \nrelative immunity to the financial contagion was, however, largely the \nconsequence of its own financial underdevelopment. While this protected \nthe South by chance this time around, it carries serious risks of its own, \nas evident in the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Underdeveloped \ncapital markets may also hinder the allocation of capital to its most \nefficient uses, thus inhibiting long-run growth. More generally, the South \nfaces some serious challenges and risks to its own growth, even in the \nshort term, and its continued robust growth is far from guaranteed.\nBut even with such risks and challenges, the South on balance is \nbetter positioned than the North to sustain growth in the short run for \nthe reasons outlined above. Long-term structural factors such as the law \nof diminishing marginal returns to capital and technological catch-up \nalso strongly favor the South, which still remains far poorer than the \nNorth. \nStill, there is nothing automatic about the process: developing Asia \nmust continue pursuing closer trade, investment, and other economic \nlinks with other parts of the South, an issue examined in Part 2. The \nfact that the non-Asian developing world\u2019s improved performance in \nrecent years is partly due to stronger fundamentals and policies further \nreinforces the case for seeking closer ties.\nWhile those links are underdeveloped at present, the global \ncrisis highlighted the large potential for mutual benefit. For example, \ndeveloping Asia (including the PRC) is likely to have been a major \nsource of growth in global demand for commodities, a key export for the \nnon-Asian developing world. Broader and deeper South\u2013South links will \nnot only benefit the South, but also the North and the world economy by \nstrengthening the South.

Between \n1980 and 2010, the region grew at an average annual rate of 7% and in \n2010 accounted for more than 60% of the South\u2019s economic output. The \nstellar performances of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India \nwere major factors in this trend. \nThe contribution of the region to world output growth rose \nfrom 27% in 1981 to 51% in 2010 (although this increase is somewhat \nmagnified by the global crisis). But even without the PRC and India, \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s share of world GDP nearly doubled (from 5.1% in 1980 \nto 9.6% in 2010).\nFor developing Asia, looking South is becoming increasingly \nimportant for at least three reasons.

First, there is the model of factory Asia, \nin which parts and components move through cross-border production \nnetworks with the PRC as the last-stage assembly hub for exporting \nfinal products to countries in the North. This phenomenon opened an \nopportunity for other countries in developing Asia with narrow export \nbases. The competitive position of the PRC and its growing economic \nmuscle, in particular, brought numerous benefits to neighboring countries \nthrough employment creation in ancillary industries with their backward \nand forward links, greater access to regional markets, and higher growth. \nThese production networks are not, however, geared toward producing \nfinal goods for the price-sensitive consumers of developing countries\u2014as \nthey were primarily designed to produce high-quality products for \nconsumers in the North. \nThere are currently no such networks spanning developing Asia, on \nthe one hand, and the other regions of the South, on the other. Thus \nthe concept and technologies of factory Asia can possibly be exported \nto, say, Africa and Latin America with the networks being designed to \nproduce goods for the price-elastic markets in those regions. Not only \nwill developing Asia\u2019s FDI in these new networks enhance employment \nopportunities, raise workers\u2019 incomes, increase domestic demand, and \nenhance growth prospects, it will also address in part global imbalances \nby recycling high savings in developing Asia into investment in the South.\nConsider the prospects for Latin America, in particular. Most Latin \nAmerican countries have attained middle-income status and are oriented \nto domestic expenditure. They are therefore prime markets for factory \nAsia. A problem is the large infrastructure investment needed to improve \nthe links and reduce the costs of trade. If the high savings of developing \nAsia can be channeled to fund these infrastructure projects, however, ", "42    Asian Development Outlook 2011\ntrade costs may be sufficiently reduced to make the expansion of factory \nAsia to Latin America feasible. \nThe second factor is developing Asia\u2019s emerging middle class. These \nconsumers are less sensitive to price differentials, and so are driving \ndemand for high-quality products in the region. This group can possibly \nabsorb part of the high-quality exports of Southern economies that used \nto go to the North.\nLearning from peers\nGreater integration will allow the economies of the South to share \nexperiences and to learn from each other. In an interconnected world of \nmultipolar growth, there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d model of development. \nThis raises the imperative for countries to diversify sources of knowledge \nand share development experiences. Happily, as a consequence of \nrapid improvements in information and communications technology, \nNorth\u2013South and South\u2013South knowledge exchanges are becoming more \nfrequent. Within the South, the specific expertise of Southern countries \ntends to be easier to adapt and use, providing efficient development \nsolutions and complementing the ones available in conventional North\u2013\nSouth cooperation. \nIndeed, peer-to-peer learning (the sharing of know-how, good \npractices, and innovation) and technology transfer remain major \nmotivators for South\u2013South cooperation. Arenas include the Africa \nplatform, the Ibero\u2013American Program in Latin America and the \nCaribbean, and the South\u2013South Knowledge Exchange Platform \nsponsored by the World Bank Institute. \nExamples of successful partnerships in knowledge exchanges abound, \nespecially between Africa and Asia (as discussed in Wider economic links \nfor development, below). \nRebalancing\nSouth\u2013South links are creating new drivers of aggregate demand that \nare likely to foster a more resilient and balanced growth of the world \neconomy. Having experienced significant economic setbacks during the \nrecent crisis, industrial economies will take a while to reassume their role \nas the primary source of demand for the global economy. \nAt the same time, economies of the South have shown strong promise \nto grow rapidly (see Part 1 of this Asian Development Outlook 2011). The \nrising consumption of emerging economies and new investment flows \nwithin the South represent opportunities for more diversified drivers \nof global growth. To make these prospects a reality and to assist in the \nglobal recovery process, however, economies in the South will need to \nbecome more open to trade and capital flows from each other, and their \ndomestic expenditures will have to increase\u2014not just for consumption \nbut also for investment\u2014to help to drive South\u2013South trade and FDI.\nImpediments to tapping potential gains\nThat gains from closer economic integration within the South are not \nfully realized suggests that there are problems to be hurdled. These come \nin the form of persistent trade barriers and uncompetitive domestic ", "South\u2013South economic links    43\n2.1.5 Average tariff rates\nindustries that are likely to be dislocated and crowded out as \nEast Asia and the Pacific South Asia Latin America \neconomies adopt more open policies.\nMiddle East and North Africa Sub-Saharan Africa\nCountries across the South have become more open; still,  United States European Union\nnumerous \u201cbehind-the-border\u201d problems persist.

Policies that lower trade \nbarriers and implement trade-facilitating and customs-harmonizing \ninitiatives will promote trade in final goods across Southern regions. \nIn turn, this expansion in trade across the South will allow many of its \ndeveloping economies to transition from labor-intensive to capital- and \nknowledge-intensive manufacturing, in effect setting them on a higher \ngrowth profile. \nWhile expanding factory Asia to other regions in the South may raise \nincomes, improve employment opportunities, and increase growth rates \nin the long run, it may be dislocative in the short and medium run. Faced \nwith more intense competition, domestic industries may be unable to \nthrive; undercapitalized, they may be crowded out of markets for scarce \nresources, such as skilled labor and capital equipment. \nHence industrial and regulatory policies may need to mitigate the \ninitial ill-effects of opening up the more autarkic economies to trade and \ninvestment. Indeed, this can be a topic for knowledge sharing among \npolicy makers in the South.\nImportance of trade and foreign direct investment\nTwo avenues for South\u2013South cooperation should be emphasized: trade \nand FDI. Both are private sector\u2013led and market-oriented initiatives that \npromote economic efficiency. Moreover, as trade volumes and investment \nflows increase among countries, payoffs to maintaining and deepening \nties rise correspondingly. Trade and FDI are usually forerunners of deeper \nand broader sociocultural and political international relations. Finally, \nas discussed above, trade and FDI are drivers of economic growth and \ndevelopment.\nWhy focus on South\u2013South trade? For one overriding reason: trade \nwill continue to be an engine of growth for Southern economies, though ", "44    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nthe largest marginal gains are not in North\u2013South trade. As noted \nabove, an issue that has gone under the radar is that South\u2013South trade \nand nontrade barriers are now higher than those facing North\u2013South \nexchange. Thus Southern countries need to lower tariffs on imports from \nother Southern countries, and construct trade-facilitating infrastructure \nto reduce transaction costs and open up more widely South\u2013South trade \nroutes. \nAs for capital investment, it is important to highlight South\u2013\nSouth FDI for the following reasons. First, South\u2013South FDI may be \nbetter suited to developing-country conditions. Perhaps introducing \ntechnologies that are not as advanced, capital investment from the South \nmay be more labor intensive and require skill and education levels that \nare well within the capabilities and attributes of the workforce in a \ndeveloping country. \nOr the entrepreneurial experience of multinational companies from \nthe South may allow them to better navigate developing-country markets \nand political conditions (Aykut and Goldstein, 2006). In addition, FDI \nfrom the South may be better able to produce products for the South\u2019s \ngenerally lower-income markets (Prahalad, 2004). A case in point: the \n$2,500\t\u201cPeople\u2019s\tCar\u201d\tof\tIndia\u2019s\tTata\tMotors.\nSecond, its cyclical fluctuations being different from those of North\u2013\nSouth flows, FDI from the South may possibly reduce the volatility of \ntotal financial flows in the South\u2014as observed in Africa, where investors \nfrom the PRC continued to undertake projects even at the height of the \nglobal crisis (Davies, 2010). If so, the more stable financial flows will \npromote greater economic stability in the FDI host countries.\nThird, the size of South\u2013South FDI flows is an indicator of the state \nof financial integration among the economies of the South. The hope \nis that, with deeper financial markets, closer financial integration, and \nimproved institutions and investment climate, the South will see its \nsavings channeled toward investment opportunities in the South rather \nthan funneled to deficit spending in the North.\nAs trade and investment links among Southern countries flourish, \nwider economic links can be expected. Labor markets can become more \nunified, development experiences and technical cooperation initiatives \ncan be more widely shared, and macroeconomic policies can be better \ncoordinated. A more integrated South holds the promise of a sustainable \npath to growth and development.\nSouth\u2013South links as a sustainable path to \ngrowth and development\nThe region has grown rapidly in the past few decades and, together with \nAfrica, Latin America, and the Middle East, has emerged as the driver of \nglobal growth while recovery in the North struggles. Within the South, \nAsia\u2019s role is becoming more prominent. The rise of developing Asia as a \npotential source of world demand and its growing economic links with \nSouthern countries holds the promise of improving their prospects for \ngrowth and reducing global imbalances. But, can strengthening these \nlinks prove to be a harbinger of sustainable growth in developing Asia?", "South\u2013South economic links    45\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s links with the rest of the South have grown rapidly. \nTrade in goods and services by Southern economies has intensified to \ntake advantage of its potential gains. In contrast to trade integration, \nfinancial integration has not happened as deeply although both inward \nand outward FDI links have grown within the South. These are especially \nevident in developing Asia in comparison with Africa, Latin America, \nand the Middle East. However, while Southern economies have emerged \nas important sources of outward FDI, the majority of global outward FDI \nflows and stocks still originate in the North.\nStructural weaknesses in the South perpetuate its dependence on the \nNorth. In the real sector, the global crisis has highlighted the continuing \ndependence of the South on final demand from the North. And although \ntariffs have declined significantly, countries throughout the South still \nface numerous behind-the-border problems exacerbated by structural \nweaknesses and institutional failures. \nThe financial markets and regulatory structures in the South also \nremain underdeveloped. The economic crisis brought to the fore the \nSouth\u2019s heavy reliance on the North for parking its surplus savings into \nlow-risk assets there rather than recycling the funds within the region. \nThis, in turn, contributed to the expansion in global imbalances and also \nperpetuated the dearth of funds to finance crucial investment projects in \nthe region. \nOne key challenge for policy makers in emerging nations is therefore \nto create a regional and domestic enabling environment that will attract \nfinance to flow into local investments in the region. Even if these \nbottlenecks are eased, South\u2013South cooperation cannot be a panacea for \nall development challenges. The dependence of growth of the economies \nof the South on markets of the industrial world is still high and raises \nconcern about the sustainability of this growth if the North fails to revive \nfrom its slowdown soon.\nCloser financial and real integration holds the promise of raising \nconsumption and investment in the South, narrowing global imbalances, \nand sustaining growth in developing Asia. Closer financial market \nintegration would ensure that surplus funds from the South are used to \nfinance productive investments within the South. It would also break \nthe vicious circle of vulnerability to the fortunes of the North. In the \nreal sector, the South must carry on reducing bottlenecks to trade for \nexpanding final goods trade within the region to make up for the slack in \nthe North. \nFixing the real and finance sector problems will contribute to a rise \nin domestic expenditures in the South. In the short run, this would lead \nto a narrowing of global imbalances. In the longer term, closer links \namong Southern countries would foster the growth of new markets, \nimprove trade in goods and services, expand investments, provide greater \neconomic opportunities, and contribute significantly to their growth. \nGiven developing Asia\u2019s dominant role in the South, this would put its \ngrowth on a sustainable path. \nWith continued high dependence of the South\u2019s economies on markets \nof the industrial world, these stronger economic links would build a \nplatform on which the North and the global economy can grow again. ", "46    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nExpanding South\u2013South \neconomic links through trade\nSouth\u2013South trade in goods has expanded considerably during the \nlast two decades. Its share of merchandise trade rose by a factor of 2.4, \nfrom about 7% in 1990 to 17% in 2009 (Table 2.2.1).3 To a large extent, \nthis trend was due to the emergence of factory Asia, fragmented-\nproduction networks that have the PRC as the last-stage assembly hub \nof production processes.

And as developing Asia consolidated \nits dominant position in the world trade of manufactures, the share of \nSouth\u2013South trade in global merchandise trade increased.\nSo dominant is developing Asia\u2019s role in South\u2013South trade that \nthe region accounts for about 75% of this commerce with the PRC \nalone taking up about 40%. Obviously, much of the traffic reflects the \nintraregional trade flows of factory Asia. But developing Asia\u2019s trade with \nother Southern regions has been expanding. With its growing appetite for \nprimary commodities, which it needs to fuel its rapid economic expansion, \ndeveloping Asia is driving up global demand for these goods, which come \nmainly from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. In turn, these \nmarkets\u2019 imports of Asian manufactures have been increasing as well.\nThus as several recent studies and reports have suggested\u2014see, \nfor example, Broadman (2007), Goldstein et al. (2006), and Santiso \n(2007)\u2014the \u201cChina factor\u201d (which is construed to include developing \nAsia) has proved to be both a boon and a bane for the rest of the South. \nFor countries with narrow export bases in primary commodities, \nhigher world demand in these goods\u2014including developing Asia\u2019s \nimport needs\u2014has created windfall gains from higher prices. For other \ncountries, factory Asia has been a powerful antagonist in third markets \nfor manufactured goods, crowding out the exports of some countries or \nprecluding entry altogether to industrialization\u2019s laggards. \nThe dilemma for the non-Asia South is therefore how to exploit gains \nfrom trade while avoiding the downside of specializing in natural resources.\nDespite this quandary, there is scope for the South to accelerate its \nintegration as a group and with the world economy by gradually clearing \nthe remaining bottlenecks to trade. Indeed, the integration of the South \npresents large potential benefits. Although Southern countries have \nlowered the level of applied tariffs considerably, they are still high by \nstandards of the North. Calculated from 2005\u20132008 data, average applied \ntariffs were 9.3% in the South, compared with 3.2% in the North. \nOther trade costs also arise out of developing countries\u2019 weaker \ntrade-related infrastructure and logistics, as well as institutional barriers. \nFor example, in 2010 it took 11 days and fewer than five documents, on \naverage, to export or import a standardized unit of cargo among OECD \neconomies, but it took more than twice as many days for countries in East \nAsia and almost three times as long for those in South Asia, with more \ndocuments involved (World Bank, 2010). \nSimilar constraints were found in Latin American and Middle \nEastern countries, and were most acute for the low-income economies of \nSub-Saharan Africa. Hence, as may be expected, the industrial countries \ngenerally received the highest marks in infrastructure and logistics \ncompetence per the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index, with \ndeveloping countries ranking much lower, with the notable exceptions of \nHong Kong, China and Singapore, the world\u2019s top-rated trading hubs.\nAssuming continued rapid economic growth in Asia and to a \nlesser extent in other developing countries, simulation analyses (see \nA simulation of South\u2013South trade, below) using a global economy model \nsuggests the following. First, the share of South\u2013South trade in global \ntrade is likely to double within the next two decades. Second, lowering ", "48    Asian Development Outlook 2011\ntariff barriers on South\u2013South trade to levels on South\u2013North trade \ncould bring as much as three-quarters of the welfare gains to Southern \ncountries as generated by the global elimination of tariff rates: South\u2013\nSouth trade would expand by 23%. Third, regional initiatives, such as \nthe expansion of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nfree trade agreement to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, \ncan potentially bring about substantial gains for developing Asia and \nsignificantly expand South\u2013South trade.\nTrade reforms in support of South\u2013South trade, however, must not \ncome at the expense of continuing global integration. In view of the \nproliferation of regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere, it is \nbecoming increasingly important for such pacts to be made as broad-\nbased as possible and to be compatible with World Trade Organization \n(WTO) provisions. \nA comparison of Asia\u2019s South\u2013South FTAs with their North\u2013\nSouth counterparts in five key areas\u2014tariff liberalization, rules of \norigin, liberalization of trade in services, WTO notification, and deep \nintegration\u2014reveals that the latter are generally more consistent with \nWTO and other global rules.

By \n2006\u20132007 (2-year average), the proportions had converged to about 50% \nand 49%, respectively. \nThis is explained by the higher demand for imports among Southern \neconomies as a result of their strong growth performance and the \nemergence of greater trade complementarities between them, as their \nproduction structures became more diversified over time.

Driven by its increasing \ndemand for primary resources, the PRC became Africa\u2019s largest \ntrading partner in 2009, surpassing both the European Union and the \nUnited States. The exports of the five oil-rich countries (Angola, Equatorial \nGuinea, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo, and Sudan) represent as much \nas 85% of Africa\u2019s exports to the PRC (Hanson, 2008). Much of the recent \ngrowth in these flows is accounted for by oil imports from Sudan and \nother African nations, although PRC firms also import a significant \namount of non-oil commodities, including timber, copper, and diamonds. \nThe PRC, however, recently began to import minerals, agricultural \nproducts, and some manufactured goods from Africa, such as processed \nfood and household consumer goods. This last development reflects the \nbudding interest of PRC firms in Africa as a growing market, for low-cost \nconsumer goods, in which establishing a commercial presence through \nFDI might prove profitable. And it has been facilitated by the progressive \nopening up of African economies and the privatization of their industries. \nAdditionally, the PRC has invested massively in Africa\u2019s fuel and \nmineral sectors, particularly in Angola, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, \nSudan, and Zambia. As these investment projects become operational, \ncommodity exports to the PRC are bound to increase rapidly.\nThe scope for boosting Asia\u2019s South\u2013South trade\nAthukorala (forthcoming) estimates the intensity of bilateral trade flows \nduring 1990\u20132008, among the 12 largest economies of developing Asia9\nand all their trading partners.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the \ndeclines in trade shares are more pronounced under South-wide tariff \nreductions, as a result of which the share of North-to-South exports \nand of South-to-North exports fall by 2.6 and 2.5 percentage points, \nrespectively, relative to the core projection estimates.", "62    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nStress scenarios: Slower growth in the North and \nthe alleviation of global imbalances\nGiven the importance of demand from the North as the ultimate driver \nof factory Asia\u2019s production network and the ramifications this has for \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s intraregional trade, the following question arises: How \ndoes stronger South\u2013South trade hold up against slower growth in the \nNorth? \nThe plunge in the industrial economies\u2019 demand for exports from \nthe developing world during the recent crisis raised the need for \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s economies to become more self-reliant and to adopt \npolicies that broaden the scope and structure of their openness to \ntrade and capital flows. To gradually shift developing Asia\u2019s supply and \ndemand structures toward Southern and intraregional markets, however, \nfar-reaching structural and macroeconomic adjustments are needed. On \nthe supply side, for example, it has been argued that the value chains of \nPRC-centered international production networks have to overcome issues \nof production and product specificity as well as adjust their physical and \nhuman infrastructure to the new structure of demand (ADB, 2010b). On \nthe demand side, in turn, household consumption has to be stimulated by \ntransferring corporate saving to households and reducing precautionary \nsaving (ADB, 2009). \nThe simulation framework adopted here is suitable neither for \nexploring these issues in their full complexity nor for drawing \nimplications for developing Asia and the South more broadly. But to \nroughly gauge the implications for South\u2013South trade of a weakening of \ndemand from the North, the following stress scenario is tested: suppose \nthe rates of growth of GDP and capital flows in the North are reduced by \none-third compared with the core projection and, as a consequence, the \nSouth slows down by half the North\u2019s rate.\nThe results of the simulation exercise indicate that the South would be \nunable to simply rely on its higher growth momentum and, in turn, the \nshare of South\u2013South trade would not expand. Clearly, unless the South \nfully makes up for the lower demand from the North, it is likely that the \ndynamism and viability of factory Asia would come under stress. \nA second stress test explores an issue related to the South\u2019s reliance \non the North, namely, the gradual reduction in North\u2013South imbalances. \nTo the extent that South\u2013South trade grows as a share of total trade, some \nof the largest imbalances at the bilateral level along North\u2013South lines \ncan be expected to fall. By the same token, imbalances among Southern \nregions are likely to widen, particularly if the commodity composition of \ninterregional South\u2013South trade remains largely unaltered and demand \nfor Asia\u2019s manufactures exports continues to expand.\nAgain, the full implications cannot be explored within the simulation \nenvironment employed. To assess the robustness of South\u2013South trade \nagainst global imbalances, the following two assumptions are imposed: \nboth the PRC surplus and United States deficit are eliminated by 2030; \nand global growth rates are unaffected by the trade rebalancing. \nLeaving the other assumptions from the core baseline unaltered and \naccommodating changes in the trade balance by allowing saving rates \nto decline in the PRC and increase in the United States, the simulation ", "South\u2013South economic links    63\nresults suggest that, even under such extreme assumptions of complete \nexpenditure switching in the PRC and a dramatic increase in the saving \nrate in the United States, the overall pattern of the main findings does \nnot change. Most importantly, the South\u2019s share in global trade almost \ndoubles as it did in the core baseline projection. \nThree conclusions from the simulation results\nFirst, the South has the potential to boost trade within the group. \nLowering barriers to South\u2013South trade, even to the levels prevailing \nin South\u2013North trade, could bring three-quarters of the gains to \nSouthern countries as would flow from a freeing of all countries\u2019 goods \ntrade. The share of South\u2013South trade in world trade would expand by \n6.1 percentage points, or about one-quarter, compared with the core \nprojection.\nSecond, to benefit the South as a whole, regional initiatives should be \ninclusive and eventually extend market access to other countries on an \nMFN basis. For example, it was shown that if an ASEAN+6 bloc were to \ntrade freely on an MFN basis, this could generate for Asia almost half of \nwhat would accrue to the region if the whole world so liberalized. South\u2013\nSouth trade would rise by 2.3 percentage points, or almost one-tenth, as a \nresult.\nThird, growth in the North and demand from that region will \ncontinue to play an important role for the South. This is particularly the \ncase for developing Asia and its trade within the region, given that the \nfinal outputs of its production networks are still largely geared toward \nthe North. A progressive shift of supply and demand structures toward \nincreased regional demand will take time for Asia to accomplish, and \nuntil then the viability of factory Asia will continue to be linked to the \nvicissitudes of the North, albeit to a lesser and lesser extent as South\u2013\nSouth economic integration advances. \nSummary\nSouth\u2013South trade has expanded rapidly during the past two decades, \nwith its share of merchandise trade rising from about 7% in 1990 to 17% \nin 2009. The main determinants of this trend have been the emerging \neconomies\u2019 strong growth performance and rising share of world \nGDP, the rise of fragmented-production and trade networks, and the \nprogressive dismantling of trade barriers. \nAs the leading proponent of international production networks in the \nSouth, developing Asia has been the main driver of South\u2013South trade. \nThe region as a whole now accounts for about three-quarters of the trade \namong Southern countries (although by and large the flows are confined \nwithin developing Asia).\nThe PRC alone accounts for about 40% of this intra-South traffic \nin goods. In large part, this share reflects the PRC\u2019s pivotal role as \nthe last-stage assembly hub of the parts and components production \nnetworks referred to as factory Asia, the final output of which is exported \npredominantly to the affluent markets of the North.\nAt roughly one-quarter of South\u2013South trade, the combined share of \nLatin America, Africa, and the Middle East is small. Since 2000, however, ", "64    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nthese regions\u2019 trade with the South has been expanding at an average \nannual rate of 26%\u2014faster than Asia\u2019s 23%.\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s trade with the other regions of the South has \nincreased markedly during the past two decades. Of developing Asia\u2019s \nimports from the South, almost 80% was attributable to the PRC. Mainly \nconsisting of primary commodities, these imports were used to fuel the \ncountry\u2019s economic expansion. In turn, the PRC\u2019s manufactures exports \nwere increasingly absorbed by growing demands from Latin America, \nAfrica, and the Middle East. \nAlthough global trade as a whole stands to gain from further \nreductions of tariffs and other barriers to trade, which tend to be higher \nin the South, an abiding policy focus on lowering these remaining hurdles \nwill spur South\u2013South trade especially. \nAverage tariff levels in the South have come down dramatically \nover the past two decades, but they are still much higher than those \nin the North. Moreover, tariffs faced by exporters from the South are, \non average, higher in the South than they are in the North. Logistics \nperformance of the South, as measured in its various dimensions by the \nWorld Bank, has shown significant improvement since 2007; it is still not \nup to par, though, with the North. \nThere is therefore scope for developing Asia and other developing \nregions to deepen trade integration and further increase the volume \nof South\u2013South trade through a gradual clearing of the remaining \nbottlenecks. Simulation analysis suggests that lowering tariff barriers to \nSouth\u2013South trade even to just the levels prevailing in South\u2013North trade \ncould bring three-quarters of the gains to Southern countries as would \nbe generated by the global elimination of tariff barriers, and South\u2013South \ntrade would expand as a result.\nHowever, trade reforms in support of South\u2013South trade must not \ncome at the expense of continuing broader global integration. In view of \nthe proliferation of regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere, it is \nincreasingly important that the terms and conditions of future accords be \nmade as broad-based and inclusive as possible, as well as consistent with \nWTO provisions. A comparison of Asia\u2019s North\u2013South FTAs with their \nSouth\u2013South counterparts reveals that the former are generally more \ncompatible with WTO and other global rules (Box 2.2.2). Continuing \nits policy of open regionalism and ensuring that future FTAs are \ncomprehensive and compatible with global rules are two strategies that \noffer Asia a promising path to take toward freer trade.", "South\u2013South economic links    65\nExpanding South\u2013South \neconomic links through \ninvestment\nAttracted by the PRC\u2019s opening up to investment in 1978 and, \nin particular, by the establishment of export-processing zones  2.3.1 Average net capital flows to the South, by type\nin the country\u2019s coastal provinces, FDI spurred the PRC\u2019s rise as \nForeign direct  Financial derivatives Portfolio\na world trade powerhouse.

And this \nis because the PRC, relative to African host countries, has the \ncapital, technology, and access to markets for these investments.\nIn the case of the Republic of Korea\u2019s multinational companies, their \ninvestments throughout developing Asia were apparently undertaken to \ntake advantage of cheap labor (efficiency-enhancing), and to penetrate \nlocal markets (market-seeking). Lee et al. (forthcoming) also argue that \nthese firms have increasingly engaged in outward FDI in part because of \npush factors, such as rapidly rising nominal wages and frequent labor-\nmanagement conflicts at home\u2014in other words, for efficiency gains and \nto maintain competitiveness.\nFDI from the North and the South may have somewhat different \nemphases, however. Fung et al. (2002) contend that investments from \nHong Kong, China and Taipei,China are efficiency-seeking, sensitive \nto infrastructure conditions and labor costs, whereas investments from \nJapan are market- and resource-seeking, focused on labor quality (skilled \nlabor is a scarce resource and is a complement to advanced technology). \nIn the same vein, Brooks and Hill (2004) claim that most Singaporean \nfirms investing overseas, including the PRC, are actually high value-\nadded manufacturers or service providers (seeking skilled labor to \ncomplement new technology).", "South\u2013South economic links    73\nA variation on the motivations may explain the investment of \nSouthern firms in the North. South-to-North FDI can be intended to \nacquire brands with established markets and technologies of production, \ndistribution, and advertising that are unavailable in the South.\nBut FDI may be influenced by other factors as well. For instance, \nSingaporean investment in East and Southeast Asia was motivated in part \nby personal relations the firms had with local partners and customers. \nIn some host countries, such as the PRC and Malaysia, ethnicity and \nsocial connections played a role for Singaporean investment as well. In \nthe PRC, the drivers of FDI evolved over time as policy and the business \nenvironment became more conducive to foreign investment (Box 2.3.2).\nIn addition, other factors, such as the state of financial development, \nthe quality of institutions, or the investment climate, can be crucial \ndeterminants of FDI flows. A financially deep market provides firms with \naccess to capital for undertaking cross-border investment. Although it is \nwell recognized that the banking sector is the primary source of funds \nfor investors in developing countries, Brooks and Jongwanich (2010) \nmaintain that financial depth in terms of stock and bond markets has \nbegun to play a role in financing cross-border transactions in developing \nAsia as well.\n2.3.2  Factors that influence inward foreign direct investment in the People\u2019s Republic of China\nWhen the PRC opened up to investment in 1978, most  more investors from the North who were less inclined to \nFDI inflows came from Hong Kong, China.

The entry of multinational companies can reduce the \nmonopolistic power of local firms and improve market efficiency. \nIt can also improve production efficiency and enhance economic \ngrowth by clearing bottlenecks to investment; introduce new know-how \nby bringing in new products, production and marketing techniques (with \ntheir concomitant demonstration effects, and by training workers who \nlater become employees in local firms); transfer techniques on inventory \nmanagement and quality control; and force local firms to upgrade \nmanagerial quality, intensify managerial effort, or adopt the marketing \ntechniques used by multinational companies, either in domestic markets \nor internationally. \nIn turn, the more intense competition between such companies and \nlocal firms, as well as the demonstration and learning-by-doing effects \nof new production methods, lead to higher economywide productivity. \nIndeed, this is precisely why many countries offer special incentives to \nforeign enterprises, including lower income taxes or income tax holidays \nand import duty exemptions.\nSpillover effects are not as readily apparent for North\u2013North and \nSouth\u2013South (lateral) FDI as they are for North-to-South (vertical) \nflows. Although only a few analyses exist on Southern lateral flows, the \nconsensus is that South\u2013South FDI generates weak spillover effects at best \n(from intermediate-input imports and higher labor employment rates). In \ncontrast, for vertical investment, local firms seem to benefit more from \nNorthern technology (Box 2.3.3).\n2.3.14 Inward and outward FDI flows, by source and \nOutward foreign direct investment from  destination, People\u2019s Republic of China \nDeveloping Asia excluding Hong Kong, China\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China Hong Kong, China North Other South\nOffshore financial centers Latin America Africa\n% share, 2005\u221209 average\nDecomposition of recent FDI flows to and originating from the \n100\nPRC suggests that Hong Kong, China and offshore financial \n80\ncenters are the PRC\u2019s dominant partners for both inward and  60\noutward FDI, with a combined average share of 61% for inward  40\nand 76% for outward FDI during 2005\u20132009.

The PRC government deregulated outward FDI in 1976, allowing \nPRC firms to establish joint ventures abroad. These were initially seen \nin Hong Kong, China, and Sudan, where the motivation was trade-\nrelated and resource-seeking. The PRC\u2019s outward FDI did not show real \nincreases, however, until 2003 when its investment in the nonfinance ", "76    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nsectorhit$2.9billionandwasfollowedbyyearsofannualdoubling until\nflows\treached\t$59.0\tbillion\tin\t2010.\nOutward FDI from the PRC became noticeable in 2003, or about \n3 years earlier than what Dunning\u2019s (1981, 1986) rule of thumb would \nforecast. Were this rule\u2014that a country becomes a FDI exporter only \nafter\tits\tper\tcapita\tgross\tnational\tincome\texceeds\t$2,000\u2014correct,\tonly\t\nin 2006 would the PRC have become a significant source of FDI. That \nit became so earlier is probably due to the role played by state-owned \nenterprises. From 2002 to 2003, outward FDI from the PRC increased \nfrom\t$0.98\tbillion\tto\t$2.85\tbillion,\twith\t73.5%\tof\tthe\tlatter\tamount\tdue\t\nto such enterprises. And in 2003\u20132009, they accounted for more than \n80% of the PRC\u2019s outward FDI stock and flow, with funds coming from \nhuge corporate savings. Investments from state-owned enterprises were \nprimarily resource seeking, going to energy and mining, in both North \nand South (Table 2.3.3). \nTable 2.3.3 Outward FDI from the People\u2019s Republic of China, by type\nMotivation Industry Firms and characteristics Location\nResources Energy and resources (mining in particular)  Central state-owned enterprises Worldwide\nleasing and business services\nMarket Wholesale and retail trades,  Small and medium-sized enterprises,  Asia, Africa, and Latin America for \ntelecommunications, textiles, shoe-making,  except for a few big companies like  local markets\nand car industry (labor intensive) Huawei and ZTE\nEfficiency Electronics, machinery Green (air-conditioner maker), Sany  Mainly south, such as Latin America \n(machinery manufacturer)\nStrategic assets Research or design center, merger with  Sany, Gily, Lenovo, Haier Europe\nor acquisition of technology-intensive \ncompetitor\nSource: Li (forthcoming).\nIn contrast, outward FDI of private enterprises tended to come \nfrom small- and medium-size enterprises and in manufacturing. \nForeign investments by private enterprises mostly sought to penetrate \nsouthern markets in industries such as telecommunications, textiles, and \nautomobiles. Certain investments in Latin America were intended to reap \nefficiency gains through reductions in transport cost and by using local \nproduction centers as regional bases. Most investments were in labor-\nintensive industries. For example, the PRC\u2019s FDI in the South included \ninvestments in telecommunications, city-bus manufacturing, and \ninfrastructure construction. \nAs a result of the surge in outward FDI, the PRC has become an \nimportant source of capital and technology for neighboring, low-income \ncountries, thus promoting industrial migration. \nSummary and key policy messages\nThe importance of South\u2013South FDI is rising. While the majority \nof global outward FDI flows and stocks still originate in industrial \neconomies, developing economies are emerging as important sources of \noutward FDI, with their share reaching 20% of the global total. Because of \nits high growth profile and accumulating financial resources, developing ", "South\u2013South economic links    77\nAsia is becoming a major player in this trend, accounting for more than \n70% of outward FDI stock from developing countries. Indeed, the region\u2019s \nsignificance was highlighted by the resilience of outflows from developing \ncountries during the global financial crisis, in contrast to those coming \nfrom the North.\nOver the past two decades, Asian FDI has become more intraregional \nas, driven by the success of factory Asia, international production \nnetworks have deepened. More than half of total FDI inflows to \ndeveloping Asia are estimated to originate in the region. Recent evidence \nfrom seven economies of developing Asia (the PRC; Hong Kong, China; \nIndia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Taipei,China; and Thailand) \nindicates that about 40% of their combined outward FDI (excluding India \nand the Republic of Korea) were directed to the region, while 37% of their \ninward FDI flows originated in the region.\nEnterprises invested with foreign capital are known to introduce \nnew products or technology and to enhance the quality of the labor \nforce in the host economy. The evidence that South\u2013South FDI does this, \nhowever, is mixed at best. To maximize the benefits of inward FDI, host \neconomies ought, therefore, to design and adopt investment policies such \nthat positive externalities are generated for both local firms and the labor \nforce. More specifically, continued efforts should be made to improve the \nbusiness environment, upgrade labor skills, foster technology transfer, \nand integrate FDI firms into local economies. In addition, policy makers \nin host economies should periodically scrutinize the effectiveness of trade \npolicy to ensure that industries are not overprotected and that regulations \nare not constraining growth.\nDeveloping Asia is playing an increasingly important role in filling \nthe investment needs of other countries inside and outside the region \nand, in turn, improving the productive capacity of industries in those \ncountries. Prospectively, outward FDI from the high-saving countries \nof developing Asia can also help to address the global current account \nimbalance to the extent that savings are invested in Southern countries \nrather than in low-risk assets in the North. \nNorthern FDI\u2019s strong suits\u2014association with more advanced \ntechnologies and more effective management styles\u2014remain \nindispensable. Northern and Southern FDI complement rather than \nsubstitute. Moreover, the low FDI-to-capital-stock ratio of many \neconomies in developing Asia suggests that the quality of the capital \nstock (with implications for technology and other spillovers) can be vastly \nimproved, which can best be addressed by Northern sources of capital.\nCountries in developing Asia should therefore continue to promote \ninvestment-friendly policies to attract more FDI. These strategies include \nimproving the investment climate to attract foreign capital in a broader set \nof industries; developing the finance sector, particularly equity and bond \nmarkets to facilitate flows of funds; and promoting capital-account openness.", "78    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nWider economic links for \ndevelopment\nSouth\u2013South economic links go beyond trade and investment. Labor \nmovement and remittances, knowledge sharing, and macroeconomic \npolicy coordination are other channels through which developing \neconomies are benefiting from closer ties. For knowledge sharing and \npolicy coordination, a wide range of cooperative activities is carried out \neach year, but their extent is unclear as systematic monitoring is lacking.\nLabor movement and remittances\nJust as globalization has opened up markets for goods and capital, so it \nhas for labor. Freer cross-border movement of people has allowed labor \nmarkets of different countries to be more closely integrated. People \nare on the move, the streams reflecting divergences in circumstances \nand opportunities, which results in more efficient allocation of global \nresources. Out-migration from labor-surplus economies increases labor \nproductivity; in-migration to labor-scarce countries provides either cheap \nor highly demanded labor. Ultimately, labor movements contribute to \neconomic growth all round.\nIndustrial countries of the North remain the most sought-after \ndestinations of migrant workers. But the economic success of the South \nhas created rising demand for both unskilled workers and highly skilled \nprofessionals\u2014the former to produce manufactures cheaply or provide \nlow-skilled services, and the latter to complement new technology. \nLabor flows within the South accelerated in the early 1970s when the \nMiddle East started attracting thousands of workers from Asia for \nconstruction work and domestic service as a result of the oil price \nboom. \nIn particular, the workers came from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, \nPakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. More recently, \nEast and Southeast Asia have become major destinations for \nAsian workers, with their export-led model of development.  2.4.1 Stock estimates of migrants, 2010 \nNotable host countries in these subregions include the newly  North Africa Middle East\nindustrialized economies of Hong Kong, China; the Republic  Latin America  Developing Asia\nMillions\nof Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China, as well as emerging  150\neconomies of Malaysia and Thailand.\n100\nAmong migrant settlers, North\u2013North migrants constitute \nthe largest group (Figure 2.4.1).

To ensure that labor movements are \nmutually beneficial, coordinated policies are needed.\nGrowing migration has gone hand in hand with rising flows of \nremittances, which contribute to the economic growth of recipient \ncountries and provide an additional source of funds for their receiving \nhouseholds. A majority of the top 10 remittance-receiving countries in the \nworld (India, the PRC, Mexico, the Philippines, Bangladesh, \nand Nigeria) are in the South, with developing Asia accounting  2.4.3 Remittance inflows \nfor the lion\u2019s share of the total flows.

The economic resilience of the South manifested itself in the \nNorth\u2013North\nrising share of South\u2013South remittances\u2014from 18% in 2005 to 25% in  North\u2013South\n2010 (Figure 2.4.4).

New opportunities for global learning across regions and \ncountries are opening up, and the sharing of development experiences \n(including through North\u2013South, South\u2013South, and triangular \ncooperation) to strengthen and broaden sources of knowledge for growth \nand development has expanded. \nCommensurate with the economic growth of the South, South\u2013South \nknowledge sharing has become an important part of international \nrelations. Indeed, South\u2013South knowledge exchange is one of the nine \npillars of the G20 Development Consensus for effective collaboration \namong developing countries on development solutions. It can be \nenhanced through triangular cooperation arrangements, where a bilateral \nor multilateral donor teams with a more advanced developing country to \nprovide lessons and advice to another developing country.\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC, 2008) \ngives examples of South\u2013South knowledge sharing. These include \ntechnical cooperation programs of various countries, such as Argentina, \nChile, Egypt, and Tunisia, as well as the PRC, India, the Republic \nof Korea, Singapore, and Thailand. It notes, however, that Southern \nmultilateral institutions play only a limited role in technical cooperation \nand that Southern bilateral development cooperation is driven mainly by \ngeographic proximity, except the PRC\u2019s. \nDrawing a distinction between North\u2013South and South\u2013South \ncooperation, ECOSOC observes that projects supported by Northern \ndonors focus more on social sectors, whereas Southern bilateral and \nmultilateral institutions prefer projects in hard-core infrastructure sectors \nsuch as communications, energy, and transport. \nFor Asia, Schulz (2010) lists numerous examples of cooperation on \nknowledge-sharing spanning a wide range of areas such as poverty \nreduction, sector programs, local administration, microfinance, and aid \nmanagement. The International Poverty Reduction Center, set up in 2005 \nin the PRC, promotes experience sharing with developing countries and \nassists them through training, research, and exchange events. \nProspectively, countries in the South can learn from each other on \nvarious other issues. Sharing best practices in environment-friendly \nmanagement of solid and hazardous waste, for example, can enhance \neconomic sustainability and reduce health care costs. Similarly, \nknowledge sharing on farming technology and practices that increase \nagricultural productivity, as well as on mitigating the impacts of global \nwarming on agricultural production, can improve food security.\nKnowledge-sharing mechanisms have mushroomed at all levels, \nbut they lack harmonization, with communication and coordination \namong the layers limited. Building a strong architecture for South\u2013South \ncooperation calls for systematically sharing these mechanisms.\nMacroeconomic cooperation\nCoordinating macroeconomic policies and institutional measures has \nbecome an effective means of economic cooperation. For example, G20\u2019s \nactions during the global crisis helped to synchronize fiscal and monetary ", "South\u2013South economic links    81\nstimuli across countries. And following the return to growth of the global \neconomy, it is now focusing on how global imbalances are best addressed.\nThe recovery of the world economy underscored the value of South\u2013\nNorth macroeconomic cooperation. South\u2013South cooperation, however, is \nlikely to figure more prominently in global rebalancing initiatives. Indeed, \nproposed solutions cannot focus on United States\u2013PRC bilateral trade \nbalances alone, because many developing Asian economies also have trade \ndeficits with the PRC. Instead, coordinated exchange rate adjustments can \nmitigate the disruptive effects of, for instance, a unilateral exchange rate \nrealignment on other economies.\nTwo other instances of macroeconomic and institutional cooperation \ninvolve countries adopting a common economic policy. Addressing short-\nterm volatility in capital inflows by imposing temporary capital controls \ncan be harmful for a country if it acts unilaterally. But the policy may \nbe feasible if it is executed in an internationally coordinated manner. As \nmentioned in Part 1 of the Asian Development Outlook 2011, G20\u2019s plan to \nestablish practical indicative guidelines for assessing a country\u2019s current \naccount imbalances and set out principles for capital control is a useful \nstart, to which the South, particularly Asia, can provide many lessons.\nIn a similar vein, using the South\u2019s savings to fund regional investment \nprojects rather than placing them in safe assets in the North can \ncontribute to global rebalancing. But this requires deepening the regional \ncapital markets and adopting coordinated policies for capital market \nliberalization. Fortunately, regional financial institutions in the South \nhave been taking steps to integrate with global markets, develop domestic \ncapital and bond markets, and promote macroeconomic coordination.\nMany efforts at macroeconomic cooperation are under way in the \nSouth. In Latin America and the Caribbean, initiatives include the \nproposal to establish a cohesion fund (a structural instrument intended \nto reduce economic and social gaps and to promote regional economic \nstability) for member states of the Central American Common Market, \nand the creation of the Mercosur Structural Convergence Fund (that \nalso promotes competitiveness and social cohesion, particularly among \neconomically smaller members). \nIn Asia, ASEAN+3 projects consist of setting up the informal ASEAN \nSurveillance Process (to monitor and exchange information on financial \nand economic developments); developing Asian bond markets; adopting \nthe Economic Review and Policy Dialogue process (for exchanging views \non global, regional, and country economic development issues as well \nas on risks affecting regional economies and the options for policy); and \nestablishing\tthe\tmultilateralized\tChiang\tMai\tInitiative\t(a\t$120\tbillion\t\nreserve pool intended to provide short-term liquidity to supplement \nexisting international financial arrangements).\nHarnessing South\u2013South cooperation to its full \npotential\nSouth\u2013South cooperation initiatives can be a powerful force for \ndevelopment and change. Closer ties will facilitate better sharing of goods \nand services, knowledge and technology, and even labor resources. This ", "82    Asian Development Outlook 2011\nsharing, in turn, will afford more opportunities for countries in the South \nto grow economically. Integration of regional markets through the core \nareas of trade and investment will allow a better distribution of benefits \nfrom the growth process as well. Expansion of economic relations within \ndeveloping Asia and across Southern countries will not only strengthen \nAsia\u2019s role as a driver of global growth, but also give its lagging states a \nchance to catch up with the leading ones.\nTo fully realize these benefits, however, the South needs to address \nnumerous bottlenecks\u2014including outdated laws, regulations, and \nstandards; barriers to trade; poor investment climates; low-quality \ninfrastructure; and shortages of capital and skilled labor\u2014all of which \nhamper the deepening and expansion of links among its economies.

The North is the residual.\n2  The impact of recent developments in North Africa and the Middle East, however, is not yet \nclear.\n3  Data for all economies other than Taipei,China are compiled from the UN Comtrade \ndatabase, based on Revision 3 of the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC, \nRev. 3). Data for Taipei,China are obtained from the trade database of the Council for \nEconomic Planning and Development, Taipei,China. The data set spans from 1990 to 2009. \nThe reported data refer to merchandise trade, not services trade, for which a comprehensive \ndatabase of bilateral flows is not available. To facilitate the comparability of trade shares \nacross regions over time in view of sharp price fluctuations, the discussion generally refers \nto merchandise trade net of fuel trade (oil and gas, SITC category no. 3), unless otherwise \nspecified.\n4  Although this exclusion introduces a downward bias to the share of the oil-exporting \nregions, it does not alter the basic conclusion on Asia\u2019s dominant role in South\u2013South trade. \nIn 2009, for instance, developing Asia\u2019s share in total South\u2013South merchandise trade was \n66% when fuel is included and 74% when fuel is excluded, and the PRC\u2019s corresponding \nshares were 37% and 40%. \n5  While this is the case for average tariffs applied, it is also true that peak tariffs tend to be \nhighest in the North, especially for products of key interest to Southern exports, such as \nfood products. \n6  The growth rate of non-Asian South\u2013South trade was as high as 47.2% a year on average \nfrom 1990\u20131991 to 2000\u20132001, although its base was very small.\n7  The exception is Latin America, whose South\u2013South share of exports is below that of \nimports. This is explained by the inclusion of Mexico in the regional aggregate. As a \nmember of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico sends a large share of its \nexports to Canadian and United States markets. When Mexico is excluded, Latin America\u2019s \npatterns are consistent with those of the other Southern regions. \n8  Based on data sourced from the Latin Business Chronicle, the US Census Bureau, and \nEurostat. \n9  People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Republic of Korea; \nMalaysia; Pakistan; Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam.", "84    Asian Development Outlook 2011\n10For a detailed description of the Logistics Performance Index, see http://info.worldbank.\norg/etools/tradesurvey/mode1a.asp.\n11 Recall, though, that the model assumes that there are no changes in agricultural trade \npolicies over the projection period. Perhaps more realistic scenario, especially for a rapidly \ngrowing Asia, is a steady rise in agricultural protection to slow the decline in food self-suffi-\nciency\u2014as happened over the past 50 years in the most advanced Asian economies (see, for \nexample, Anderson and Nelgen, 2011).\n12 In reality, some of these agreements have already been partly implemented and others, if \nimplemented, will be staggered over time.\n13 Although certainly indicative, the results are based on comparative static analyses that fail \nto capture additional dynamic gains from trade reform, which can be substantial. \n14 This estimated global welfare gain from freeing all of the world\u2019s merchandise trade turns \nout to be small both in absolute terms and compared with the welfare effect of a GDP \nslowdown in high-income countries. As the caveats in the next section make clear, however, \nthese gains from global trade reform are very much lower-bound estimates. \n15 The South\u2013North average tariffs for each commodity are implemented as a ceiling tariff for \nSouth\u2013South trade, with any bilateral tariffs already lower than these remaining unaffected \n(the exception predominately farm products).\nBackground papers\nAnderson, K., and A.

In this scenario, rapid increases in \nexports of minerals put upward pressure on the exchange rate and \ninflation, draw resources away from nonmineral sectors, and generate a \nstream of government revenue available for subsidies and handouts. The \noutcome can be uncompetitive nonmineral industries and overextended \ngovernment budgets (particularly when global mineral prices turn down).", "Taipei,China\nA powerful recovery last year reflected a rebound in domestic demand and a surge in exports.

Finally, inability \nto bring the planned short-term addition to power supply, such as the \ncommissioning of small, private diesel and fuel-oil generators, and \nslippage in addressing gas shortages would also slow growth, mainly \nthrough their impact on industry. \nDevelopment challenges\nTwo critical challenges to exploit Bangladesh\u2019s growth potential are to \nupgrade infrastructure and to ensure a large, skilled workforce. \nA major step in upgrading infrastructure was taken recently: three \nindependent power producer contracts were awarded for generation. Once \ncompleted, they will add over 1 gigawatt to the grid, helping to relieve \na bottleneck for industrial and employment expansion. Efforts are still \nneeded to take advantage of the public\u2013private partnership mechanism \nto create projects in infrastructure and to make the Bangladesh \nInfrastructure Finance Fund operational. \nBangladesh could reap a rich demographic dividend by transforming \nits large young population into a productive human resource through \nbetter education and health care. A balanced combination of public and \nprivate sector initiatives in delivering these services is needed. \nAnother issue is ensuring the availability of land for public and \nprivate sector projects. The rapidly declining land available per capita, \nexacerbated by poorly maintained land records, is making it increasingly \ndifficult to buy land for infrastructure or industrial and commercial use. \nA linked emerging challenge is urban congestion, in Dhaka and \nChittagong especially, but also in other urban areas.

High inflation, \nespecially for food, puts poverty-reduction gains at risk, however. The \nimmediate challenge is to restore stability in the economy by fully \nimplementing the policy directives of February 2011.\nMaintaining price stability and economic growth in the longer term \nrequires further improvements in efficiency, particularly in the state-\nowned sector; development of the financial system; and heavy investment \nin infrastructure and education to address supply-side bottlenecks.\nState-owned firms are a drag on the economy. They absorb many of \nthe available resources but their efficiency is much lower than among \nprivate firms. Hence a better performance from them would stimulate \neconomic growth and release budget resources for more productive uses. \nRegardless of ownership, putting them on a commercial footing, exposing \nthem to competition, and holding them financially accountable\u2014\nparticularly for noncore activities\u2014would improve their efficiency.\nFurther reforms are needed to safeguard the financial system (the \nSBV took the important step of raising minimum capital requirements in \n2010). Supervision of banks would be strengthened if the capacity of the \nSBV to provide regulatory oversight were upgraded and if a risk-based \nsupervision framework were adopted (shifting from a compliance-based \napproach). A move toward international standards for bank provisioning \nwould also strengthen banks\u2019 stability.\nFinally, timely publication of economic and financial data would help \nto build public and investor confidence.

Policy makers \nin the region now have to face the challenge of managing inflation pressures. These are \nbeing pushed by rising demand from the swift regional rebound and resurgent international \ncommodity prices.\nLooking ahead, the region must develop new avenues to sustain its growth over the long \nterm.

Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. \nDespite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: \n1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than \n$1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.  \nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/publications\nISBN 978-92-9092-285-8\nISSN 0117-0481\nPublication Stock No. FLS112948\nPrinted on recycled paper Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20110425175200+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS3 (5.0.4)", "Keywords": "ado, ado2011, south-south economic links, regional cooperation, regional integration, economic indicators, economic forecasts, economic development, economic growth", "ModDate": "D:20110503204331+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 8.0", "Subject": "The annual Asian Development Outlook provides a comprehensive analysis of economic performance for the past year and offers forecasts for the next 2 years for the 45 Asian economies that make up developing Asia.", "Title": "Asian Development Outlook 2011: South-South Economic Links", "Trapped": "False"}}
