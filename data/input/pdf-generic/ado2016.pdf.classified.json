Modest \nrecovery in Southeast Asia and sustained growth in India will partly offset continued moderation in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and associated spillover into neighboring economies. Risks to the growth outlook \ntilt to the downside: future US interest rate hikes that may intensify global financial volatility, a sharper-than-\nforecast growth slowdown in the People\u2019s Republic of China that would hurt regional exports and growth, \nemerging producer price deflation that may undermine growth in some economies, tepid prices for oil and \nother commodities, and El Ni\u00f1o.  \n\nThis edition highlights the need to invigorate developing Asia\u2019s potential growth, whose decline since its 2007 \npeak explains much of the region\u2019s growth slowdown since the global financial crisis. To ensure a healthy future \nfor potential growth, Asia must employ the full range of policy responses to augment labor supply, improve \nlabor productivity, enhance institutional quality, and maintain macroeconomic stability. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries \nreduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains \nhome to the majority of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping \nits developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and \ntechnical assistance.\n\n \n\nA\ns\ni\na\n\u2019\ns\nP\no\nt\ne\nn\nt\ni\na\n\nl\n \n\nG\nr\no\nw\nt\nh\n\n \n\nA\nS\nI\nA\nN\nD\nE\nV\nE\nL\nO\nP\nM\nE\nN\nT\nO\nU\nT\nL\nO\nO\nK\n2\n0\n1\n6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2016\n\nASIA\u2019S POTENTIAL GROWTH\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\nISBN 978-92-9257-385-0\fASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2016\n\nASIA\u2019S POTENTIAL GROWTH\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n\n\u00a9 2016 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n\nSome rights reserved.

notwithstanding, developing Asia will continue to \ncontribute 60% of world growth. Weighing sluggish growth in the \nUnited States and the euro area, the transition of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) to an economy led by consumption and services, and \nIndia\u2019s ongoing structural reform, Asian Development Outlook 2016\nforecasts 5.7% growth for developing Asia in 2016 and 2017. \n\nMost subregions of developing Asia will see growth slow in 2016 \nbefore rebounding in 2017. Growth in South Asia, whose expansion \nwas the highest of any subregion in 2015, is expected at 6.9% in 2016, \naccelerating to 7.3% in 2017 as reforms are implemented in India\u2019s \nfinancial sector. East Asia will see growth moderate in both years in \ntandem with the PRC, whose growth is expected to slow to 6.5% this \nyear and 6.3% in 2017 as it contends with reduced investment among \nother factors. \n\nEconomic performance is poised to improve in Southeast Asia as the \n\nlarge economies of Indonesia and the Philippines ramp up investment, \nViet Nam sustains its expansion, and Thailand gathers momentum, \nthough Malaysia will slow further with weak oil prices. Meanwhile, \nlow\u00a0commodity prices will curb growth prospects in Central Asia and \nthe Pacific, in part by constraining fiscal spending. \n\nRegional inflation has been favorable to Asian economies, as low \ninternational food and fuel prices helped cut average inflation to 2.2% in \n2015 from 3.0% in 2014. Inflation is likely to pick up to 2.5% in 2016 as \ndomestic demand strengthens and to 2.7% in 2017 as global commodity \nprices recover slightly.\n\nUncertainties abound in the global economic environment, and \nrisks to developing Asia\u2019s growth are mostly on the downside. This \npublication examines the implications of an unexpectedly sharp \nslowdown in the PRC, which could cut both global and regional growth \nby nearly 1.8 percentage points. The impact in the region would be \nmainly on trade volumes and commodity prices, the severity felt by each \nneighbor economy depending on its ability to accommodate and adapt to \nthe changes. \n\nProducer price deflation is associated with lower investment and \nlower economic growth and has become an emerging concern for many \nAsian economies. Thus, policy makers are advised to pay attention to \nfalling producer prices because they compound producers\u2019 debt burdens \nand weigh on their investment decisions. \n\nAsian Development Outlook 2016 examines in detail how the growth \n\nslowdown in Asia since the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 has \naffected the region\u2019s potential growth. Defined as the maximum growth \nrate associated with the full employment of productive resources, \npotential growth is determined by changing demographics and labor \nproductivity.\n\n\fPotential growth in the region has fallen by 2 percentage points \n\nsince the global financial crisis. Absent structural reform, many \neconomies in the region will see a further decrease because of \nunfavorable demographics, convergence with advanced economies, and \nspillover from growth moderation in the PRC. \n\nTo invigorate potential growth, policy reforms are needed. On top of \npromoting sound macroeconomic management, reform should offset the \nimpact of less-favorable demographics by increasing female participation \nin the workforce, extending the working age, and raising labor \nproductivity through capital investment and measures to reduce factor \nmisallocation. Policies such as these can help sustain growth, thereby \nraising living standards and further reducing poverty in Asia. \n\nTAKEHIKO NAKAO \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nAsian Development Outlook 2016 was prepared by staff of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the Central and West Asia Department, \nEast Asia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, \nSoutheast Asia Department, and Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department, as well as in ADB resident missions. \nRepresentatives of these departments constituted the Regional \nEconomic Outlook Task Force, which met regularly to coordinate and \ndevelop consistent forecasts for the region.\n\nThe authors who contributed the sections are bylined in each \n\nchapter.

Regional \nin\ufb02ation will revive to 2.5% in 2016 as domestic demand strengthens, and rise \nfurther to 2.7% in 2017 as global commodity prices recover.\n\nRisks are tilted to the downside as tightening US monetary policy may heighten \n\ufb01nancial volatility, further moderation in the People\u2019s Republic of China could \nspill over into its neighbors, and producer price de\ufb02ation may undermine \ngrowth in some economies.\n\nReform to raise labor productivity can invigorate developing Asia\u2019s potential \ngrowth. \n\nShang-Jin Wei\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fxii\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nRescuing growth in uncertain times\n\nSlow going in a tough global environment\n\n(cid:31) Growth in developing Asia is forecast to dip slightly. Gross domestic product (GDP) \nin the region will expand by 5.7% in 2016 and 2017, decelerating from 5.9% in 2015 \nin a difficult and uncertain global environment. Solid growth in India and a pickup in \naggregate growth in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will help \nbalance continued growth moderation in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Despite \nthe slight dip, the region will contribute around 60% of global growth in the next 2 years, \nclose to its contribution in the past 5 years.\n\n\u00bb Growth in the industrial economies is unlikely to pick up this year. Aggregate \ngrowth in the major industrial economies\u2014the United States (US), the euro area, \nand Japan\u2014will stay at 1.8% in 2016 before inching up to 1.9% in 2017. In the US, \nexpanding private consumption and investment will be tempered by weak external \ndemand. While recovery in the euro area is gradually gaining ground, domestic and \nexternal risks abound, keeping growth from breaking out of its slow 2015 pace. \nJapan\u2019s growth will improve slightly, helped by a pickup in private consumption this \nyear in anticipation of a value-added tax increase next year.\n\n\u00bb The PRC continues to shift away from its reliance on investment and exports.\nGrowth slowed further last year as exports faltered, labor shortages began to bite, \nand the short-term adverse impact of supply-side reform took its toll. Reduced \ninvestment in industries with excess capacity will be another factor moderating \ngrowth still further to 6.5% (within the government\u2019s target range of 6.5%\u20137.0%) and \nto 6.3% next year. \n\n\u00bb Strong public investment boosted growth in India despite weak exports. Reform \ngeared to attract more foreign direct investment progressed, and the authorities \nworked to repair corporate and bank balance sheets. While macroeconomic \nfundamentals are strong, progress on major structural reform is expected to be \ngradual. Growth momentum will be sustained at 7.4% in 2016 before picking up to \n7.8% in 2017 with measures to fund stalled projects and an uptick in bank credit. \n\n\u00bb Stronger growth is seen for ASEAN. Aggregate growth in the 10 ASEAN economies \nis forecast to accelerate steadily from 4.4% in 2015 to 4.5% in 2016 and 4.8% in \n2017. Growth will be led by Indonesia as it ramps up investment in infrastructure \nand implements policy reform that spurs private investment. Solid consumption \nand investment will provide a lift to the Philippine economy. Thailand\u2019s recovery \nis expected to gather momentum, and Viet Nam will sustain vigorous expansion. \nIn\u00a0contrast, Malaysian growth will slip further with low oil prices and weak external \ndemand. \n\n\u00bb Low commodity prices weigh on growth prospects in Central Asia and \n\nthe\u00a0Paci\ufb01c. Continued low oil prices are exerting pressure on \ufb01scal spending in \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste, slowing subregional \ngrowth in Central Asia and the Paci\ufb01c. While the expected pickup in oil prices will \nbring some relief in 2017, growth is expected to remain below the 5-year average \npace to the forecast horizon.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xiii\n\n(cid:31) Most Asian economies bene\ufb01t from low international food and fuel prices. The \nlarge fall in oil and food prices tempered in\ufb02ation. The regional rate eased from 3.0% \nin 2014 to 2.2% in 2015 as global oil prices fell by 47% and average food prices by 15%. \nRegional\u00a0in\ufb02ation will revive to 2.5% in 2016 as domestic demand strengthens and rise \nfurther to 2.7% in 2017 as global commodity prices recover. \n\n(cid:31) The regional current account surplus will narrow this year and next. Subdued \ndemand for manufacturing exports and continued low commodity prices will trim \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s current account surplus from the equivalent of 2.9% of regional GDP \nin 2015 to 2.6% in 2016 and further to 2.4% in 2017. Yet the region\u2019s increasing global \neconomic weight means its surplus will widen slightly to 0.7% of world GDP in 2016, \nup\u00a00.1 percentage points from last year. \n\n(cid:31) Risks to the regional growth forecast remain tilted to the downside. Future interest \nrate hikes by the US Federal Reserve may tighten global \ufb01nancing conditions. This, \ncombined with broader weakness in emerging markets, could heighten investors\u2019 risk \naversion and intensify global \ufb01nancial market volatility. A sharper-than-forecast growth \nslowdown in the PRC would further dim the global outlook and directly hurt regional \nexports and growth. Tepid prices for oil and other commodities cast a shadow over the \nprospects of Asia\u2019s commodity-dependent economies. Finally, El Ni\u00f1o looms as a major \nweather risk for economies that rely on agriculture. While consumer price in\ufb02ation is \ngenerally low but positive, producer price de\ufb02ation has emerged as a new spoiler in the \nPRC and other Asian economies. \n\nSpillover from the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n(cid:31) Growth moderation in the PRC weighs on regional growth. Simulations estimate \n\nthat the drop in PRC growth may have shaved as much as 0.3 percentage points from \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s outlook. The PRC effect is largely centered on Asia, re\ufb02ecting strong \nregional trade and production links. In contrast, the impact on the US and the euro area \nthrough trade is largely offset by the bene\ufb01t of lower commodity prices. The unlikely \nevent of a sharp growth decline in the PRC triggered by some type of \ufb01nancial shock \nwould be signi\ufb01cant, however, lopping nearly 1.8 percentage points off global growth. \nSimulations of such a scenario show oil prices down by 10%\u201325% relative to the baseline, \nwhile growth in Japan would lose 1.5 percentage points and in developing Asia 1.8 points. \n\n(cid:31) Ongoing structural change in the PRC is affecting its import structure.\u00a0Contributing \n\nto its growth moderation, the PRC is currently undergoing a structural transformation from \ngrowth led by exports and investment to growth grounded on domestic consumption. \nAs\u00a0a result, while investment has been the main growth driver since\u00a02001\u2014peaking at \nan 86% contribution to growth in 2009\u2014consumption now contributes more than half. \nThe\u00a0PRC role in global value chains is also changing as rising wages shunt some activities \nto lower-cost economies and technological upgrades shift the PRC into activities that add \nmore value. These structural changes are re\ufb02ected in the sharp drop in the share of parts \nand components in PRC imports since the mid-2000s and a slight rise in the share of \nconsumer goods.\n\n(cid:31) How PRC structural change affects an economy depends on the relationship. \nSpillover from PRC restructuring into particular economies will differ depending on \nwhether they are exporters of consumer goods, parts of the same production chain, or \n\n\fxiv\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\ncompetitors, either current or potential. For example, the Republic of Korea has lost \nmarket share as the PRC increasingly mastered high technology, but Viet Nam has \nincreased its share of parts and components in PRC imports as it has taken over from the \nPRC lower-skilled tasks within production chains. Other Asian economies may bene\ufb01t \ntoo as the PRC withdraws from labor-intensive pursuits. Bangladesh, for one, has taken \nup garment manufacturing to become the world\u2019s second-largest garment exporter.\n\nEmergent producer price de\ufb02ation \n\n(cid:31) The PRC and some other Asian economies recently experienced producer price \nde\ufb02ation. Slowing economic growth has combined with sharply lower oil prices to \npush producer price in\ufb02ation into negative territory, though consumer price in\ufb02ation \nremains mostly positive. In 2015, the PRC saw producer prices contract by 5.2% and, \nby February\u00a02016, it had endured 48 consecutive months of producer price de\ufb02ation. \nDe\ufb02ation in the PRC may be transmitted to its neighbors through lower export prices, \nespecially if the renminbi depreciates. In fact, producer prices fell in 2015 by 9.1% in \nSingapore, 6.7% in the Philippines, and 4.8% in Malaysia\u2014and by smaller margins in \nIndia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Hong Kong, China. \n\n(cid:31) Commodity price shocks get diluted along distribution chains before affecting \n\nconsumers. The pass-through of oil and food prices thus tends to be lower for consumer \nprices than for producer prices. In the PRC, for example, the cumulative pass-through of \na 1% drop in global oil prices after 4 quarters reached 14 basis points for producer prices \nbut only 3 basis points for consumer prices. In Thailand, the cumulative pass-through \nof a 1% drop in global food prices reached 21 basis points for producer prices but only \n7 basis points for consumer prices. The lower rate of consumer price pass-through may \nexplain why episodes of producer price de\ufb02ation are less rare. \n\n(cid:31) Historically, falling producer prices are more common than declines in consumer \nprices. An empirical study of 38 economies found 389 episodes of producer price \nde\ufb02ation from 1947 to 2014 but only 145 episodes of consumer price de\ufb02ation. In \ntheory, de\ufb02ation can spark a vicious cycle of weakening demand and falling prices, but \nevidence from episodes of declining consumer prices is mixed. De\ufb02ation in the postwar \nera cannot be accurately assessed by looking only at consumer prices because they may \nnot adequately capture the pressures on \ufb01rms.\n\n(cid:31) Producer price de\ufb02ation is associated with lower economic growth. Average GDP \n\ngrowth per capita was lower in an 1870\u20132014 study sample during de\ufb02ationary episodes \nthan during in\ufb02ationary ones. This held whether producer or consumer prices were \nconsidered, but regression analysis found stronger evidence of an inverse association for \nproducer prices than for consumer prices. While the correlation of growth with consumer \nprice de\ufb02ation held only during the Great Depression, signi\ufb01cant growth associations \nwith producer price de\ufb02ation held up for the full sample period, including the postwar \nsubperiod 1947\u20132014. Income grew 1.4 percentage points faster during moderate \nproducer price in\ufb02ation than during producer price de\ufb02ation in 1870\u20132014.\n\n(cid:31) Restrained investment is one channel by which producer price de\ufb02ation hampers \n\ngrowth. The producer price index measures price changes from the viewpoint \nof producers and thus affects producer decisions such as on investment. In fact, \nproducer price de\ufb02ation tended to be followed by investment contractions, as 71% \nof economies that experienced signi\ufb01cant de\ufb02ation suffered investment decline. \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xv\n\nDe\ufb02ation\u00a0can\u00a0compound producers\u2019 debt burdens and thus discourage investment. \nA mix of higher debt and lower prices reduced investment in 45% of economies that \nexperienced both.\n\n(cid:31) Policy makers should be aware of de\ufb02ation\u2019s potential to harm economic growth. \n\nLong-run historical comparisons do not rule out the possibility that de\ufb02ation, especially \nproducer price de\ufb02ation, is negatively associated with growth. The data clearly show \nthat high in\ufb02ation as well as de\ufb02ation can adversely affect growth. Because producer \nprices tend to be more volatile than consumer prices, and producer price de\ufb02ation may \ntherefore in\ufb02ict greater damage on the economy, policy makers should monitor not only \nthe consumer price index but also the producer price index. \n\nOutlook by subregion\n\n(cid:31) Slowing growth is widespread across developing Asia. Weak recovery in the major \nindustrial economies, moderating growth in the PRC, and recession in the Russian \nFederation are hampering growth in other economies with strong ties to them through \ntrade, investment, and remittances. Meanwhile, sharply lower global commodity prices \nare undermining growth in the region\u2019s oil producers, even as a presumed reciprocal \nboost to growth in oil importers remains elusive. Only Southeast Asia is forecast to see \ngrowth pick up in 2016, however modestly. The expected easing of these impediments to \ngrowth within the forecast horizon points to general improvement in 2017.\n\n(cid:31) East Asia will see growth drift lower as growth in the PRC moderates further. \nSubregional growth slowed to 6.0% in 2015\u2014a 0.6 percentage point drop from the \nprevious year\u2014as all economies slowed. The rate is expected to decline further to 5.7% \nin 2016. In the PRC, efforts to rein in debt accumulation, adverse short-term effects \nfrom supply-side reform, and emerging labor shortages will tamp down growth from \n6.9% in 2015 to 6.5% this year and 6.3% in 2017. The Republic of Korea will have stable \ngrowth this year, and Taipei,China will accelerate on higher government investment. \nMeanwhile, declines in mining output will push growth in Mongolia below 1%, and lower \ntourism \ufb02ows will slow growth in Hong Kong, China. Although rising domestic demand \nand an improving global economy will lift growth rates slightly higher in 2017 across most \nof the subregion, continued moderation in the PRC will weigh down the subregional \naverage to 5.6% in 2017. In\ufb02ation fell to 1.3% last year with lower prices for oil and other \ncommodities but will rise moderately to 1.6% this year and 2.0% in 2017 as domestic \ndemand rebounds and commodity prices recover. \n\n(cid:31) South Asia is forecast to post the most rapid growth in developing Asia. Growth in \nthe subregion accelerated to 7.0% in 2015 and will accelerate further to 7.3% in 2017 \nafter a hesitation at 6.9% this year. The subregion\u2019s prospects re\ufb02ect heavy weighting for \nIndia, where growth is expected to dip marginally to 7.4% in 2016 as exports decline and \nboth public and private investment slows, and then pick up to 7.8% in 2017 as investment \nrevives. Apart from weakness in export demand, other economies in the subregion face \nunique challenges to growth: a devastating earthquake and a political standoff in Nepal, \na drop in high-end tourism in the Maldives, and much-needed \ufb01scal reform to deal with \na buildup of excessive debt in Sri Lanka. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan see continued \nmoderate growth bene\ufb01tting from sustained progress toward macroeconomic and \nstructural reform. Subregional in\ufb02ation fell to 5.0% in 2015, bene\ufb01tting from low oil and \ncommodity prices, but is projected to revive to 5.2% in 2016 and 5.7% in 2017. \n\n\fxvi\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\n(cid:31) Southeast Asia is seen reversing its growth slowdown in the next 2 years.\n\nGrowth\u00a0slowed in 7 of the 10 ASEAN economies, edging down the subregional average \nto 4.4% in 2015. In Indonesia, growth moderated for a fourth year in a row. In Malaysia, \nsoft global demand and low oil prices cut growth by a full percentage point. Thailand\u2019s \nrecovery from a slump in 2014 was sluggish, while bad weather hurt agriculture in \nmany economies. In contrast, foreign direct investment in manufacturing and robust \nconstruction propelled Viet Nam to its strongest expansion in 7 years. Aggregate growth \nis forecast to pick up to 4.5% in 2016 and 4.8% in 2017. Infrastructure investment is seen \nboosting growth in Indonesia, while Myanmar rebounds from devastating \ufb02oods in 2015. \nMalaysia, on the other hand, faces another year of decelerating growth. Southeast Asia\u2019s \naggregate in\ufb02ation rate eased to 2.7% in 2015 in line with lower food and fuel prices. \nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to edge higher in most economies this year and next, but decelerating \nin\ufb02ation in Indonesia will hold the ASEAN average to 2.6% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2017.\n\n(cid:31) Central Asia\u2019s growth slowdown is forecast to deepen this year. Plunging petroleum \nprices, recession in the Russian Federation, and weakness in other trading partners took \ntheir toll on Central Asia, where average growth plummeted to 2.9% in 2015 from 5.3% \na year earlier. Forecasts of even lower petroleum prices and continued recession in the \nRussian Federation prompt a projection that average growth in the subregion will slow \nfurther in 2016 to 2.1%, with contraction forecast for Azerbaijan and growth at only \n0.7% for Kazakhstan. Growth is projected to recover somewhat to 2.8% in 2017 on \nthe strength of an improved external outlook and somewhat higher petroleum prices. \nSteep currency depreciation in several economies helped push average in\ufb02ation to \n6.2% in 2015 from 5.7% last year. The lagged in\ufb02ation effects of depreciation in 2015 \nand possible further currency weakness in some economies are projected to propel \naverage in\ufb02ation to 10.8% in 2016 as acceleration occurs in all economies, with in\ufb02ation \nreaching double digits in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. \nExpected\u00a0exchange rate stabilization should help rein in average in\ufb02ation in the subregion \nto 5.9% in 2017.\n\n(cid:31) The Paci\ufb01c is poised for lower growth as the economy slows in Papua New Guinea. \n\nGrowth in the Paci\ufb01c held strong at 7.0% in 2015. This was largely attributable to \ndevelopments in Papua New Guinea, the predominant economy in the subregion, \nwhere new lique\ufb01ed natural gas production and exports powered high growth. The\u00a0only \nother economy to achieve high growth was Palau, where tourism drove expansion. \nGDP\u00a0contracted in Nauru because of damage to port facilities and in Vanuatu because \nof a severe cyclone early in the year, while in energy-exporting Timor-Leste growth \nplunged as oil and gas prices fell. Average growth across the subregion is expected to \nfall to 3.8% in 2016 and further to 3.1% in 2017. In Fiji, cyclone damage is dragging \ngrowth down to 2.7% in 2016, but the economy should rebound to 4.5% growth in 2017. \nIn\ufb02ation\u00a0remained steady in 2015 at 3.4%, though Nauru experienced high in\ufb02ation as \nproblems at the port affected trade. In\ufb02ation is expected to rise slightly to 4.5% in 2016 \nand 4.7% in 2017.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xvii\n\nAsia\u2019s potential growth\n\nUnderstanding the growth slowdown\n\n (cid:31) Growth momentum has \ufb02agged in developing Asia since the global \ufb01nancial crisis. \nFrom an average of 8.3% during 2006\u20132010, GDP growth in the region fell to 5.9% in \n2015. This decline is likely to have repercussions for the region and the rest of the world. \nDeveloping Asia\u2019s success in lifting 1 billion individuals out of poverty during 1990\u20132012 \nhinged on its ability to sustain high rates of economic growth. Moreover, since the region \ncurrently accounts for more than a quarter of world GDP as valued at market exchange \nrates, a persistent slowdown in developing Asia threatens to undermine the fragile \nglobal\u00a0recovery.\n\n (cid:31) The right policy response depends on the nature of the region\u2019s slowdown. Is it \na temporary\u2014albeit prolonged\u2014effect of the business cycle? Or are more persistent \nchanges under way? If weaker growth re\ufb02ects slack demand such as softening export \norders or a downturn in private investment, then \ufb01scal or monetary stimulus may be \nneeded for temporary support. But if supply-side factors are at play, and the growth \nmoderation stems from slowing expansion of the region\u2019s productive capacity, then any \nrevival of growth prospects may depend on structural policy reform.\n\n (cid:31) Distinguishing temporary from persistent effects depends on gauging \u201cpotential \ngrowth.\u201d Potential growth is the pace at which an economy is deemed able to expand \nwith full employment and stable in\ufb02ation\u2014that is, when it is operating at its productive \ncapacity. The idea of potential growth is not immutable, as it is in\ufb02uenced by the policies \nand institutions that characterize the particular economy.\n\n \u00bb Deviations from potential come at the cost of macroeconomic stability. \n\nOperating above potential stokes in\ufb02ation, while producing below potential generates \nunemployment. Economies tend toward their potential in the long run, making \npotential growth essentially a speed limit on the pace of long-term poverty reduction.\n\n \u00bb Structural reform can yield higher potential growth from given resources. \n\u201cFrontier potential growth\u201d is the rate above potential growth that an economy \ncould achieve if global best-practice policies and institutions prevailed. By lowering \nbarriers to efficient labor and capital allocation, an economy can move closer to this \nconceptual maximum while maintaining macroeconomic stability.\n\n (cid:31) Falling potential growth explains much of the region\u2019s post-crisis growth slowdown. \n\nEstimated average potential growth for a sample of 22 Asian economies, which \naccounted for 98% of GDP in developing Asia in 2014, fell by almost 2.0 percentage \npoints from its 2007 peak of 8.4%. Falling potential growth accounts for about 40% of \nthe moderation in actual growth since the global \ufb01nancial crisis.\n\n \u00bb Falling potential growth is widespread in the region. When compared with \n\naverage potential growth in 2000\u20132007, the post-crisis period 2008\u20132014 saw \ndeclines in 14 of the economies sampled, down by 1.1 percentage points in the PRC \nand by 2.1 points in the Republic of Korea. \n\n\fxviii\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\n\u00bb Yet some economies sustained or improved their potential growth. From the \n2000\u20132007 average, potential growth in 2008\u20132014 picked up in economies as \ndiverse as Indonesia (by 0.9 percentage points), Pakistan (0.9), the Philippines (0.5), \nand Uzbekistan (2.2). Bangladesh, Fiji, and India have maintained pre-crisis potential \ngrowth into the post-crisis period.\n\n(cid:31) Future gains in living standards and poverty elimination rest on a grasp of potential \ngrowth. Identifying the institutional and policy constraints that keep an economy from \nachieving its frontier potential growth will be critical to counteract the current slowdown. \nKnowing which factors have driven potential growth in the past can guide policy makers\u2019 \nefforts to meet today\u2019s growth challenge.\n\nDeterminants of potential growth\n\n(cid:31) Shifting demographics and labor productivity growth determine potential growth. \nPotential growth is the sum of growth in the labor force plus growth in potential labor \nproductivity, or output per worker. Of these two factors, labor productivity growth \naccounted for about 80% of average potential growth from 2000 to 2014 in the \n22\u00a0Asian economies studied. However, demographic changes have had signi\ufb01cant effects \nin some economies. For example, working-age population growth explains about 50% of \npotential growth in Malaysia, 64% in Pakistan, and 47% in Singapore. Empirical\u00a0estimates \nshow that taking 1 percentage point off working-age population growth shaves \n1\u00a0percentage point from potential growth. With demographic changes turning less \nfavorable in most Asian economies, understanding what determines labor productivity \ngrowth is paramount to boosting future potential growth. \n\n(cid:31) Capital accumulation affects potential growth by lifting labor productivity. \n\nLow-income economies can grow faster during the transition to their long-run potential \ngrowth rate by upgrading their equipment and infrastructure and by adopting existing \ntechnologies. However, this \u201cadvantage of backwardness\u201d fades over the course of \ndevelopment as economies gain on their more advanced peers and eventually converge. \nEstimates indicate that an additional $1,000 dollars of initial income per capita lowers \npotential growth by 0.3 percentage points.\n\n(cid:31) A range of productivity-enhancing factors are amenable to policy interventions.\nEstimates show that gains in tertiary education enrollment and trade openness can \nboost potential growth\u2014especially in economies with the most room for improvement. \nIntegrating into international \ufb01nancial markets can be bene\ufb01cial, but the relationship \ndepends on the economy\u2019s regulatory quality. Improvements to a range of institutional \nvariables, which proxy for such things as government effectiveness and labor market \n\ufb02exibility, can also lift potential growth.\n\n(cid:31) Potential growth depends on a stable macro economy. A volatile gap between actual \ngrowth and potential growth has, with consequent bouts of rising in\ufb02ation or deepening \nunemployment, a signi\ufb01cantly negative effect on potential growth. Reducing\u00a0this volatility \nby 1.0 percentage point is estimated to pay a potential growth dividend of nearly 0.2 \npercentage points. Policies to push actual growth persistently above its potential have \nonly a temporary effect on the economy\u2019s productive capacity.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xix\n\n(cid:31) Removing obstacles to efficient factor allocation supports economic dynamism. \n\nAn economy\u2019s frontier potential growth can be realized only when capital and labor are \nallocated to the most productive \ufb01rms. Analysis of over 10,000 \ufb01rms in 13 developing \neconomies in Asia con\ufb01rms that obstacles like judicial bias, unequal access to \ufb01nance, \nexcessive labor regulation, poor electricity supply, and corruption impede the efficient \nallocation of factors across \ufb01rms, which makes them too large or too small, or too labor \nor capital intensive. Reform to remove these obstacles can enhance \ufb01rms\u2019 efficiency, thus \nmoving economies toward their frontier potential growth.\n\nA \u201cnew normal\u201d for potential growth?\n\n(cid:31) Potential growth since the global \ufb01nancial crisis differs sharply from before it. \n\nAfter accounting for changes in the determinants of potential growth, developing Asia\u2019s \naverage potential growth still declined by 2.2 percentage points in 2008\u20132014 from \nits historical trend. Is this a new normal for Asia? It is true that the decline is slightly \nsmaller than the 2.7 percentage point drop in global potential growth. However, without \nstructural reform, potential growth in many countries in the region will slide further due \nto unfavorable demographics, convergence with advanced economies, and spillover from \ngrowth moderation in the PRC.\n\n(cid:31) The demographic drag on developing Asia\u2019s potential growth will intensify. \nThe\u00a0region previously bene\ufb01ted from a favorable age structure\u2014the so-called \ndemographic dividend\u2014but slowing population growth and aging populations are \nturning this dividend into a burden. The United Nations projects that growth in the \nregion\u2019s working-age population will be lower in 2015\u20132020 than in 2008\u20132014; this \ndemographic effect alone could depress developing Asia\u2019s potential growth by 0.4 \npercentage points. Less favorable demographics span the region, with working-age \npopulation growth forecast higher among the sample economies only in Sri Lanka.\n\n(cid:31) Developing Asia\u2019s past success has narrowed the gap with the advanced economies. \nThe advantage of backwardness, which allowed developing economies in Asia to grow \nby adopting existing technologies, is fading as they converge in sophistication with the \nadvanced economies. Less scope for playing catch-up with the advanced economies \nwill make some other determinants of potential growth, such as tertiary education and \ntrade, more important to future growth. On the other hand, low- and middle-income \neconomies still have scope to bene\ufb01t from the convergence effect.\n\n(cid:31) Moderating growth in the PRC is spilling over to other economies. Ripples from \nslower growth in the PRC, one of the largest economies in the world, are spreading \nglobally, and strong trade and investment ties with close neighbors make the regional \nimpact much more pronounced. Empirical analysis controlling for other determinants of \npotential growth shows a 1.0 percentage point decline in the actual growth rate in the \nPRC associated with a 0.2 percentage point reduction in potential growth worldwide \nand a 0.5 point decline in other Asian economies. As the PRC rebalances toward a more \nsustainable, consumption-driven growth model, its pace of expansion is forecast to ease \nfurther. However, if other economies can lift their potential growth, they can counteract \nsome of the effect of PRC growth moderation.\n\n\fxx\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nPolicies to invigorate potential growth\n\n(cid:31) Policy changes can partly offset the labor squeeze. Measures to increase female \nparticipation rates and extend the working age can boost the share of workers in the \npopulation. Especially for economies facing the most severe demographic changes, \nmore\u00a0\ufb02exible immigration policies may help \ufb01rms that struggle to attract skilled labor.\n\n(cid:31) The recipe for higher labor productivity has three ingredients. They are a mix of \n\npublic and private investment, policy and institutional reform, and sound macroeconomic \nmanagement.\n\n\u00bb Capital investment is crucial to catch up with the advanced economies. High on\nthe list is government investment in infrastructure, an important public good. As the \nneeds are large, governments must \ufb01nd creative \ufb01nancing solutions such as public\u2013\nprivate partnership. To facilitate private investment, policy can incentivize companies \nto purchase new assets by, for example, accelerating depreciation.\n\n\u00bb Reform can move current potential toward the frontier. Effective policy and \n\nhigher-quality institutions can shore up Asia\u2019s long-term growth. If, over the next \ndecade, the 22 sampled economies lifted their current scores on productivity-\nenhancing factors enough to close half of the gap to the best possible scores, their \naverage annual potential growth could increase by almost 1.0 percentage point. \nReforms that, for example, rationalize \ufb01nancial and labor markets, render rules that \ngovern access to land more transparent, and improve governance and the business \nenvironment can boost potential growth by making \ufb01rms more dynamic over time.\n\n\u00bb Sound macroeconomic management is the foundation for growth. Implementing \npolicies that lower the volatility of actual growth with respect to potential growth by \n25% can add 0.1 percentage points to the region\u2019s potential growth. \n\n(cid:31) The new normal today need not be developing Asia\u2019s future normal. To ensure a \n\nhealthy future for potential growth, Asia must employ the full range of policy responses \nto augment labor supply, improve labor productivity, enhance institutional quality, and \nmaintain macroeconomic stability.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xxi\n\nGDP growth rate and inflation, % per year\n\nGrowth rate of GDP \n\nInflation \n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n6.6\n3.3\n5.8\n3.3\n6.0\n10.9\n7.4\n10.2\n8.0\n\n6.8\n7.7\n3.1\n2.9\n11.6\n2.2\n\n6.2\n3.7\n6.0\n3.6\n6.6\n4.7\n3.8\n3.7\n3.4\n\n5.0\n\u20132.1\n7.4\n5.6\n7.8\n4.7\n8.4\n7.1\n4.7\n2.7\n5.4\n\n3.8\n\u20131.7\n4.7\n2.4\n1.9\n\u20133.6\n15.4\n\u20131.7\n5.0\n\u20131.9\n2.8\n2.8\n\u20133.1\n1.3\n2.0\n\n6.4\n\n5.3\n3.5\n2.8\n4.6\n4.3\n4.0\n6.7\n10.3\n8.1\n\n6.6\n7.3\n2.6\n3.3\n7.9\n3.9\n\n6.7\n1.3\n6.1\n3.8\n7.2\n6.5\n5.1\n4.0\n4.9\n\n4.5\n\u20132.3\n7.1\n5.0\n7.5\n6.0\n8.7\n6.1\n3.3\n0.8\n6.0\n\n9.4\n\u20131.2\n5.3\n3.8\n\u20131.0\n\u20133.4\n17.5\n4.7\n13.3\n1.2\n2.0\n6.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.3\n\n6.3\n\n2.9\n3.0\n1.1\n2.8\n1.0\n3.5\n6.0\n6.5\n8.0\n\n6.0\n6.9\n2.4\n2.6\n2.3\n0.7\n\n7.0\n1.5\n6.6\n5.9\n7.6\n1.5\n3.0\n4.2\n4.8\n\n4.4\n\u20131.1\n7.0\n4.8\n6.7\n5.0\n7.2\n5.8\n2.0\n2.8\n6.7\n\n7.0\n\u20130.5\n4.0\n3.0\n\u20130.5\n\u20131.5\n\u201310.0\n6.7\n9.9\n1.4\n3.2\n4.1\n3.4\n2.0\n\u20131.0\n\n5.9\n\n2.1\n2.0\n\u20131.0\n2.5\n0.7\n1.0\n3.8\n6.5\n6.9\n\n5.7\n6.5\n2.1\n2.6\n0.1\n1.6\n\n6.9\n2.0\n6.7\n6.4\n7.4\n3.5\n1.5\n4.5\n5.3\n\n4.5\n1.0\n7.0\n5.2\n6.8\n4.2\n8.4\n6.0\n2.0\n3.0\n6.7\n\n3.8\n0.0\n2.7\n1.8\n1.5\n2.5\n3.0\n3.0\n4.3\n2.0\n3.0\n4.5\n2.8\n3.5\n2.5\n\n5.7\n\n2.8\n2.3\n1.0\n3.5\n1.0\n2.0\n4.0\n7.0\n7.3\n\n5.6\n6.3\n2.2\n2.8\n0.5\n1.8\n\n7.3\n3.0\n6.9\n6.1\n7.8\n3.9\n4.8\n4.8\n5.8\n\n4.8\n2.5\n7.1\n5.5\n7.0\n4.4\n8.3\n6.1\n2.2\n3.5\n6.5\n\n3.1\n0.2\n4.5\n2.0\n2.0\n3.5\n15.0\n7.0\n2.4\n0.5\n2.8\n5.5\n2.7\n3.0\n3.8\n\n5.7\n\n5.8\n5.8\n2.4\n\u20130.5\n5.8\n6.6\n5.0\n6.8\n11.2\n\n2.4\n2.6\n4.4\n1.3\n9.9\n0.8\n\n9.3\n7.4\n6.8\n8.8\n9.8\n2.3\n9.8\n7.4\n6.9\n\n4.2\n0.4\n3.0\n6.4\n6.4\n2.1\n5.7\n3.0\n2.4\n2.2\n6.6\n\n4.9\n2.6\n2.9\n\u20131.5\n1.9\n2.2\n0.5\n2.8\n5.0\n\u20130.2\n5.4\n9.5\n0.8\n2.0\n1.4\n\n3.8\n\n5.7\n3.0\n1.4\n3.1\n6.7\n7.5\n6.1\n6.0\n8.4\n\n1.9\n2.0\n4.4\n1.3\n12.8\n1.2\n\n6.8\n4.6\n7.3\n9.6\n6.7\n2.1\n9.1\n8.6\n3.2\n\n4.1\n\u20130.2\n3.9\n6.4\n4.2\n3.1\n5.9\n4.1\n1.0\n1.9\n4.1\n\n3.5\n1.6\n0.6\n2.1\n1.1\n0.7\n3.0\n4.0\n5.2\n\u20131.2\n5.2\n0.7\n2.1\n1.1\n1.0\n\n3.0\n\n6.2\n3.7\n4.0\n4.0\n6.6\n6.5\n5.1\n6.0\n9.0\n\n1.3\n1.4\n3.0\n0.7\n6.6\n\u20130.3\n\n5.0\n\u20131.5\n6.4\n6.6\n5.0\n1.0\n7.2\n4.5\n3.8\n\n2.7\n\u20130.4\n1.2\n6.4\n1.3\n2.1\n11.0\n1.4\n\u20130.5\n\u20130.9\n0.6\n\n3.4\n3.0\n1.4\n1.4\n0.5\n\u20131.1\n11.4\n2.2\n5.1\n1.9\n\u20130.3\n0.6\n\u20130.7\n2.0\n2.5\n\n2.2\n\n10.8\n3.8\n12.0\n5.0\n12.6\n10.0\n8.5\n6.6\n10.0\n\n1.6\n1.7\n2.5\n1.4\n3.0\n0.7\n\n5.2\n3.0\n6.2\n4.0\n5.4\n1.2\n10.5\n3.2\n4.5\n\n2.6\n0.2\n2.5\n4.5\n1.8\n2.7\n9.5\n2.3\n\u20130.6\n0.6\n3.0\n\n4.5\n1.8\n3.0\n0.3\n2.0\n\u20130.3\n6.6\n1.5\n6.0\n2.0\n4.4\n2.0\n\u20130.3\n3.5\n1.9\n\n2.5\n\n5.9\n4.0\n5.2\n4.0\n4.6\n8.0\n7.5\n6.0\n11.0\n\n2.0\n2.0\n2.7\n2.0\n7.0\n1.2\n\n5.7\n3.5\n6.5\n5.0\n5.8\n1.4\n8.2\n4.5\n5.0\n\n2.9\n0.4\n3.0\n4.2\n2.5\n2.5\n8.5\n2.7\n0.4\n2.0\n4.0\n\n4.7\n2.0\n3.0\n0.8\n2.5\n0.3\n1.7\n2.5\n6.0\n2.0\n5.7\n3.0\n0.5\n2.0\n2.4\n\n2.7\n\nCentral Asia\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz Republic\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEast Asia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\nMongolia\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nBrunei Darussalam\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Since the global \n\ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009, global economic expansion has consistently \nunderperformed expectations (Figure 1.0.1). Lower\u00a0international \nprices for oil and other commodities were supposed to be a boon to \nmost\u00a0economies, but the bene\ufb01ts have been slow to come even as the \nshock to commodity-dependent emerging economies has been immediate. \nLess-than-robust recovery in the industrial economies and slowing \ngrowth in emerging markets weigh on growth prospects everywhere. \nVolatility in global \ufb01nancial markets that stems from weakness in \nemerging markets and monetary tightening in the United\u00a0States (US) \nis\u00a0deepening the uncertainty stirred by the global slowdown.\nGrowth in developing Asia is thus expected to decelerate \n\nmarginally from 5.9% in 2015 to 5.7% in both 2016 and \n2017. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India, the \ntwo largest economies, will strongly in\ufb02uence the region\u2019s \ngrowth outcome. Growth in the PRC will continue to \ndecelerate during that economy\u2019s deliberate transition to a \nmore balanced and sustainable growth paradigm. Somewhat \nstronger growth in India and the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) will help de\ufb02ect the resulting \nheadwinds. \n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nthe importance of structural reform in developing Asia. \nThe authorities must redouble their efforts to reform their \ndomestic economies to boost potential growth. Broad\u00a0diversity \nin the region means that reform objectives and priorities differ \nfrom country to country. Whether\u00a0reform aims to make labor \nmarkets more \ufb02exible in the PRC, streamline procedures to accelerate \npublic infrastructure investment in India, or improve the business \nenvironment to facilitate diversi\ufb01cation away from oil dependence in \nAzerbaijan, it needs to be tailored to country circumstances. \n\nEven as policy makers seek to improve productivity over the \nlong\u00a0run, they must remain vigilant against short-term risks posed by \nfuture US interest rate hikes that could worsen global \ufb01nancial market \nvolatility, sharper-than-forecast growth moderation in the PRC, tepid \ncommodity prices undermining growth in producer countries, and \nsevere weather dampening agricultural production. The authorities may \nalso be challenged by heretofore unfamiliar risks such as producer price \nde\ufb02ation, which has recently emerged in some economies in the region.\n\nThis chapter was written by Donghyun Park, Gemma Esther Estrada, Arief Ramayandi, \nAkiko Terada-Hagiwara, Xuehui Han, Madhavi Pundit, Cindy Castillejos-Petalcorin, \nNedelyn Magtibay-Ramos, Pilipinas Quising, Dennis\u00a0Sorino, and Joseph E.

Aggregate gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in the region will expand by 5.7% in 2016, \ndecelerating from 5.9% in 2015 (Figure 1.1.1). This slower \nexpansion mirrors moderating growth in the PRC as it \ncontinues its shift toward a new normal with less dependence \non investment and manufacturing for export. In\u00a02017, growth \nin the region will remain steady, as continued growth \nmoderation in the PRC will be counterbalanced by solid \ngrowth in India and a pickup in other larger economies, \nnotably members of ASEAN. Average in\ufb02ation in the region \nwill rise from 2.2% in 2015 to 2.5% in 2016 on strengthening \ndomestic demand and further to 2.7% in 2017, following an \nexpected recovery in global commodity prices (Figure\u00a01.1.2). \nThe region\u2019s aggregate current account surplus will narrow \nfrom 2.9% in 2015 to 2.6% in 2016 and further to 2.4% \nin\u00a02017, as exports are unlikely to rebound strongly for lack \nof external demand (Figure 1.1.3). Further, recovery in the \nindustrial\u00a0economies has been slow (Box 1.1.1).\n\nGrowth stymied in 2015\nThe growth slowdown in developing Asia in 2015 was widespread, \naffecting most economies in the region, including all of East Asia and \nCentral Asia and most of Southeast Asia. The region\u2019s deceleration \nmirrors continued growth moderation in the PRC. The\u00a0average pace \nslipped from 6.3% in 2014 to 5.9% in 2015.\n\nGrowth in East Asia decelerated to 6.0% in 2015 from \n6.6% in 2014 as exports withered. A large drag on growth \nacross East Asia was growth moderation in the PRC. \nIn\u00a0Mongolia, growth dipped by 5.6 percentage points, and \nin Taipei,China by 3.2 points. Growth slipped by less than \na percentage point in the subregion\u2019s two other economies, \nthe Republic of Korea and Hong Kong, China, where strong \ndomestic demand countered feeble exports.\n\n0\n\nIn Central Asia, growth weakened to 2.9% in 2015 \nfrom 5.3% in 2014 as all eight economies posted slower \ngrowth on account of the huge drop in global oil prices and \nrecession in the Russian Federation, a key trade partner \nand source of remittances. Growth in oil-dependent \nKazakhstan and Turkmenistan decelerated the most, by over \n3 percentage points. In\u00a0Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, growth slowed less \ndespite large\u00a0falls in remittances and the return of migrant workers, \nthanks\u00a0to\u00a0timely and robust expansion in public investment.\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.1.1\u2002 GDP growth outlook in developing Asia\n\nDeveloping Asia\nMajor industrial economies\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nIndia\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: The major industrial economies consist of the United States, the euro area, \nand Japan.\nSources: US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis,  \nhttp://www.bea.gov; Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat; Economic and \nSocial Research Institute of Japan, http://www.esri.cao.go.jp; Haver Analytics; \nAsian\u00a0Development Outlook database; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n1.1.2\u2002 Inflation in developing Asia\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fRescuing growth in uncertain times\u2002\u20025\n\n1.1.1\u2002Meager progress in the industrial economies\n\nLower prices for oil and other commodities are expected \nto persist during the forecast period, but they will not \nprovide uplift in the major industrial economies: the US, \nthe euro area, and Japan.

The stronger US dollar has again worked against \nrecovery momentum by slashing the contribution of \nnet foreign trade and services by 0.6 percentage points. \nInflation, both headline and core, remained muted as \nUS dollar appreciation and low energy prices kept price \npressures in check. \n\nIn December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised the federal \n\nfunds rate for the first time since the global financial crisis \nbegan in 2008. The target range has been maintained since \nthen on the expectation of low inflation and a slow pickup \nin economic activity in the near term. The US policy rate is \nforecast to average 0.6% in 2016 before increasing to around \n1.8% by the end of 2017. While overall liquidity should \nremain loose in 2016, the strong dollar is still expected to \ndrag on GDP growth by restraining net external demand \nthroughout the year. As the private sector spends more \non both consumption and investment, GDP in the US is \nprojected to grow by 2.3% in 2016, modestly picking up to \n2.5% next year. \n\nRecovery in the euro area that began in 2014 failed to \npick up momentum as growth leveled off toward the end \nof 2015. Business and consumer confidence dropped to \na 1\u00a0year low as the region dove back into deflation at the \n\nturn of 2016. Labor markets improved throughout 2015, but \ndemand was insufficient to generate inflation. A\u00a0breakdown \nof regional GDP growth by component showed that \nprivate consumption contributed a relatively strong \n0.9\u00a0percentage points in 2015, followed by fixed investment \nat 0.5\u00a0percentage points. Government consumption added \n0.3 percentage points, but net exports dragged down growth \nas imports outpaced exports. \n\nThe European Central Bank announced further steps \nin March of this year toward expansive monetary policy to \nease the cost of finance, spur growth, and counter deflation. \nIt cut all the main interest rates and increased its monthly \nasset purchases by \u20ac20 billion. The composite purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index is still above 50, indicating expansion, \nbut it\u00a0has steadily declined since December, which does \nnot bode well for the strength of recovery hinted at the \nstart of 2016. Consumption demand, which was the main \ndriver of growth in 2015, lost steam toward the end of\u00a02015. \nWeak\u00a0global demand exacerbated by slower growth \nprospects in emerging economies may continue to dampen \nthe external sector. In the absence of a strong catalyst, \nthe\u00a0euro area is expected to just about maintain the pace, \nexpanding by 1.5% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017. \n\nJapan grew by a mere 0.5% in 2015, which nevertheless \n\nimproved on zero growth in 2014 despite the lack of a \nstrong growth engine. Private consumption dropped by 1.3% \nin the whole year as an unseasonably cool summer in the \nsecond quarter and an unseasonably warm winter in the \nfourth quarter dampened demand for indoor climate control \nand new apparel. Public works orders steadily declined last \nyear as the government continued its fiscal consolidation. \nTrade activity, both exports and imports, shrank in 2015, but \nimports dropped much more than exports. Meanwhile, the \nlabor market has become tighter with the unemployment \nrate falling to 3.2% in January 2016. While real wages are \nrising as the baby boom cohort reaches retirement, the slow \npace of improvement is insufficient to stave off the threat of \na return to deflation.\n\nIn response to sharper-than-expected drops in industrial \n\nproduction and soft inflation in December 2015, the Bank \nof Japan adopted negative interest rates in January 2016. \nAssuming that the value-added tax rate increase from \n8% to 10% goes ahead as scheduled in April 2017, private \nconsumption of durable goods and housing investment are \nexpected to pick up in late 2016. However, there is some \ndiscussion that the tax increase should be further delayed if \nthe economy continues to be weak. Growth will have to rely \non domestic demand while demand for imported capital \ngoods wanes in Japan\u2019s main trading partners, particularly \nthe PRC. The purchasing managers\u2019 index is slightly \nabove\u00a050 but has dipped since December 2015, suggesting \nno strong recovery on the horizon. Japan\u2019s GDP is expected \nto grow by 0.6% in 2016 and, because of drag from the \ntax\u00a0increase, by a slightly weaker 0.5% in 2017.\n\n\f6\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\n% of GDP\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\nIn Southeast Asia, growth slipped in aggregate only \nfrom 4.5% in 2014 to 4.4% in 2015 but declined in 7 of the \n10 economies. In Indonesia, the largest ASEAN economy, \ngrowth decelerated for a fourth year in a row. In Malaysia, \ngrowth dipped as global demand weakened and hydrocarbon \nprices fell. In Thailand, growth picked up from a slump \nin 2014 but remained weak. Viet Nam was the only other \neconomy with accelerating growth, driven by robust \nexpansion in manufacturing and construction. The impact \non agriculture of El Ni\u00f1o, a periodic weather event caused by \ntemperature changes in the Paci\ufb01c Ocean, partly accounted \nfor growth slipping in the Philippines and other economies.\nIn contrast with slower growth elsewhere, growth in \nSouth Asia edged up from 6.7% in 2014 to 7.0% in 2015 as \n\ufb01ve of the eight economies posted higher growth. The improvement \nwas led by India, where growth quickened to 7.6% in 2015 from 7.2% \nin 2014 on account of healthy expansion in private consumption and \n\ufb01xed investment, as well as robust growth in manufacturing. Steady \ngrowth in the rest of the South Asian economies, except Nepal and the \nMaldives, was buoyed by higher consumption and remittances, and by \ncontinued high growth in the region\u2019s biggest economy, India, which \nsustained subregional trade. Meanwhile, growth in Nepal was scaled \ndown by an earthquake in April and a political standoff, and in the \nMaldives by a decline in high-end tourism. \n\n0\n\nIn the Paci\ufb01c, aggregate growth eased to 7.0% in 2015 from 9.4% \nin 2014 as growth slowed in the larger island economies. In the past, \nstrong global commodity prices and large private investments in the \nmineral sector boosted growth in Papua New Guinea (PNG), but recent \nheadwinds from low commodity prices and soft global \ndemand have caused growth to falter. In Fiji, growth eased \nas activity slowed in sugar, \ufb01sheries, and timber, partly \nfrom unfavorable weather under El Ni\u00f1o, while in Timor-\nLeste contraction in public spending contributed to slower \nexpansion of GDP measured without reference to the large \noffshore petroleum sector.\n\nExternal demand dragged down growth in several large \n\neconomies. In 6 of the 10 regional economies with data \non contributions to growth, net exports subtracted from \ngrowth in 2015 (Figure 1.1.4). Domestic demand from private \nand government consumption was the dominant source of \ngrowth. Private consumption alone accounted for over half \nof\u00a0growth in most of these economies. \n\nIn the \ufb01rst half of 2015, consumer con\ufb01dence was bleak \n\nacross most large economies (Figure 1.1.5). Con\ufb01dence \ngradually picked up in the second half in Indonesia, the \nRepublic of Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. In the \nPhilippines, a better outlook for business activity, jobs, and \nincomes has improved consumer sentiment. In the PRC, \nconsumer sentiment fell on waning prospects for income \ngrowth against a backdrop of slower GDP growth overall. \nIn Taipei,China, consumer con\ufb01dence steadily weakened \n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n6\n\n1.1.3\u2002 Current account balance in developing Asia\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n1.1.4\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth, \n\nselected\u00a0economies\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nTotal investments\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\nGDP growth\n\nPercentage points\n\nA | B A | B A | B A | B A | B A | B A | B A | B A | B A | B\nHKG IND INO KOR MAL\n\nPRC SIN TAP THA\n\nPHI\n\nA = 2014, B = 2015, HKG = Hong Kong, China, IND\u00a0= India, INO = Indonesia, \nKOR = Republic of Korea, MAL = Malaysia, PHI\u00a0= Philippines, PRC = People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, SIN = Singapore, TAP\u00a0=\u00a0Taipei,China, THA = Thailand.\nNote: For the PRC, data on private consumption also cover government \nconsumption.\nSources: Haver Analytics; CEIC Data Company (both accessed 5 March\u00a02016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\ffrom May to December in line with fragile growth in the \n\ufb01rst half that sank into contraction in the second half, \nfurther dimming prospects for employment and income. \nIn\u00a0Hong Kong, China, consumer con\ufb01dence \ufb02uctuated, \nrising in the \ufb01rst half along with modest economic growth \nbut slipping in the second half as declines hit tourist \narrivals, particularly from the PRC, which accounted for \nover 70% of the total. Faced\u00a0with sluggish economic growth \nand downbeat consumer sentiment, the authorities in \nIndonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand \nannounced stimulus measures in the second half to bolster \neconomic growth. However, consumer con\ufb01dence in \nMalaysia continued to deteriorate until the fourth quarter \nof 2015, hitting a record low\u00a063.8. Consumer con\ufb01dence \nalso weakened in the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, and \nThailand at the start of this year. In\u00a0Taipei,China, con\ufb01dence \ndeteriorated once again in January but picked up in February.\nThe drop in consumer sentiment took its toll on retailing. \n\nIn Taipei,China, retail sales tumbled in the second half of \nlast year but began to recover gradually in the last quarter \n(Figure\u00a01.1.6).

In East Asia, industrial production \ncontracted by 1.0% in the Republic of Korea, 1.7% in Taipei,China, and \n1.5% in Hong Kong, China (Figure 1.1.7). Industrial production fell \nin Taipei,China as a wide array of manufacturing industries such as \ncomputers, telephones and mobile phones, audio and video products, \nand iron and steel registered declines. In Southeast Asia, industrial \nproduction expanded at a steady pace in Indonesia and Malaysia; \nin\u00a0Thailand, it mildly recovered after a 5.2% plunge in the\u00a0previous year. \nAfter posting modest gains in the past year, the Philippines \nand Singapore saw declines in industrial production for the \n\ufb01rst time since 2009. Singapore suffered a steep drop, by \n5.1%, as production fell across several industries including \nmachinery and equipment, metals, computers and electronic \nproducts, and pharmaceutical and related products.\n\nUncertainty in both the domestic and the external \n\nenvironment weakened investment. Singapore and \nHong\u00a0Kong, China suffered declines in gross investment, \nwhile the PRC, Indonesia, and Taipei,China saw investment \nexpand at a slower pace (Figure 1.1.8). The\u00a0slowdown in \ninvestment in the PRC continued in 2015 as real estate \nsuffered a large housing overhang and manufacturing \nfaced an uncertain business outlook and high corporate \ndebt. In contrast, investment expanded at a faster pace \nin the Republic of Korea and the Philippines with good \nperformances in both construction and investment in \ndurable\u00a0equipment.

As PRC policy makers pursue a \nsmooth transition to more moderate growth, their Indian \ncounterparts strive to maximize growth. \n\nIn the PRC, policy makers continued last year to focus \n\nmore on growth quality than growth quantity, and on \nrebalancing the economy and eliminating excess capacity \nto target growth at about 7% (emphatically not a more \nprecise \ufb01gure) through \ufb01scal stimulus and monetary easing. \nGrowth\u00a0in the PRC decelerated from 7.3% in 2014 to 6.9% \nin 2015, but it continued to account for about a third of \nglobal\u00a0growth. In India, structural reform intended to attract \nmore foreign direct investment is gradually moving forward, \nbut further reform is needed to raise private investment \nand lift potential growth. Strong public investment helped \nIndia\u2019s\u00a0economy accelerate growth from 7.2% in 2014 \nto an estimated 7.6% in 2015, the fastest rate among the \nregion\u2019s larger economies. However, a challenging external \nenvironment is likely to moderate growth in both India and \nthe PRC this\u00a0year. \n\nThe difficulty of sustaining high growth in industrial \n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\nIndex\n\n57\n\n54\n\n51\n\n48\n\nJan\n2013\n\nproduction is manifest as the efforts of the PRC to rein \nin excess capacity are bedeviled by soft global demand. \nFurther,\u00a0production has been kept in check by an uncertain \nbusiness outlook, especially for heavy industry. Growth\u00a0in \nindustrial production slowed to 6.1% in 2015 from 8.3% \nin\u00a02014 (Figure\u00a01.1.9). Production was held down by less \nupbeat business sentiment as, from August to December \nlast year, the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) languished below 50 \n(Figure 1.1.10). Meanwhile, growth in industrial production decelerated \nin most months in tandem with declining manufacturing exports. \nThe continuing slowdown in industrial production re\ufb02ects deep \ncorrections in traditional heavy industries. In January and February \nthis year, the PMI continued to linger below 50 as growth in industrial \nproduction further weakened to 5.4%. The expected slackening of \nmanufacturing growth will be pronounced in heavy industry, while \ngrowth in consumer-oriented manufacturing is likely to hold up \nbetter. The\u00a0government will continue to eliminate excess capacity in \nmanufacturing as part of its structural reform. The likely moderating \nimpact of reform and the weakening of growth momentum overall are \nforecast to bring gradual deceleration over the next 2 years.\n\nIn India, growth in industrial production accelerated in 2015, \nboosted by robust domestic demand. Industrial production expanded \nby 3.2%, up from 1.9% in 2014. The PMI registered a solid reading \nin most months, but business sentiment waned by year-end, when a \nPMI drop to 49.1 marked the \ufb01rst time since October 2013 that it fell \n\n\f10\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nbelow\u00a050. A\u00a0slide in the manufacturing PMI in December re\ufb02ected a \nless favorable outlook on domestic demand exacerbated by \ufb02oods in \nthe southern part of the country, which affected a major automobile \nmanufacturing hub. A\u00a0decline in merchandise exports also worsened \nduring the \ufb01nal quarter of 2015, further undermining business \nsentiment. The\u00a0PMI recovered to 51.1 in January and February this \nyear, along with expectations of an improvement in domestic demand. \nHowever, data on industrial production produced a contrasting picture, \nas it showed contraction in January for the third consecutive month. \nIn sum, GDP growth in India is expected to dip marginally this year \nas expansion in public investment weakens under \ufb01scal constraints, \nprivate corporations continue to deleverage, and external demand \nremains anemic. \n\nIn\ufb02ation broadly in retreat\nIn\ufb02ation was further subdued in developing Asia in 2015, \nfalling to 2.2% from 3.0% in 2014. The deceleration partly \ntracked slowing economic growth across the region and the \nconsequent weakening of demand-side in\ufb02ationary pressures. \nSupply-side factors, in particular feeble global oil and food \nprices, also helped to tame in\ufb02ation. Average Brent crude \nprices fell to $52/barrel in 2015 from $99/barrel in 2014, \na 47% drop that was \ufb01vefold the 9% fall in average prices \nin 2014. Agricultural commodity prices also continued to \ndecline, with the overall index falling by 13.1% and food \nprices by 15.4%, mainly from favorable supply conditions and \nsoft energy prices. While the drop in prices has been largely \ndue to supply factors, subdued demand has contributed.\n\nThe decline in developing Asia is part of the global trend \ntoward lower in\ufb02ation, which mirrors the global commodity \nslump and the fragility that besets the global economic \noutlook. For the major industrial economies\u2014the US, the \neuro area, and Japan\u2014aggregate in\ufb02ation fell from 1.3% \nin\u00a02014 to 0.2% in 2015, barely clinging to positive territory. \nLow\u00a0in\ufb02ation gave policy makers in many Asian economies \nthe option to keep interest rates low to support demand and \ngrowth. While consumer prices rose in most economies, some \nof them, including the PRC and India, saw producer prices \nfall in\u00a02015 (Figure\u00a01.1.11). Asia has long been preoccupied \nwith in\ufb02ation, but de\ufb02ation can present problems of its own \nby, for example, raising the real value of debt.\n\nWhile in\ufb02ation remained subdued in developing Asia as \na whole, there were substantial differences across subregions \n(Figure 1.1.12).

Modest recovery in the \nindustrial economies has not boosted export momentum. \nInstead, exports fell sharply owing to a combination of lower \ncommodity prices and subdued global demand. The\u00a0exports \nof oil-producing Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan fell by \nmore than a third, dragging down aggregate Central\u00a0Asian \nexports to about the same rate. Every East Asian economy \nsaw its merchandise exports decline. PRC\u00a0exports \nfell by 4.4%, largely because of smaller shipments to \nJapan, the Russian\u00a0Federation, and Hong Kong, China. \nIn\u00a0Southeast\u00a0Asia, exports fell in aggregate mainly because \nof steep declines in shipments from Indonesia, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, and Singapore. In the Paci\ufb01c, aggregate exports \nincreased by 34.4% on a surge recorded by PNG and Timor-\nLeste.

The drop in \nimports occurred across all subregions but was particularly \npronounced\u2014and larger than the dive in exports\u2014in \nEast\u00a0Asia and Southeast Asia. In Central Asia, the uniquely \nsteep drop in imports, by one-\ufb01fth, was still less than the \nplunge in exports. Twelve economies across the region \nposted increases in imports, four of them in South Asia.\n\nFeeble merchandise exports are expected to continue. \nExport growth is forecast to be \ufb02at this year as uncertainty \npersists. The decline in exports continued into the \ufb01rst \n2\u00a0months of this year, dimming export prospects for the\u00a0year. \nOnly around 40% of regional economies are likely to see \nexports increase this year. This portion is projected to rise \nto over half next year as export growth accelerates to 2.8% \non recovery in shipments from Central Asia and higher \ncommodity prices, and as the region as a whole bene\ufb01ts \nfrom\u00a0strengthening in global demand.\n\nImports are forecast to contract this year by 2.4%, \nand investment is expected to be less robust. Imports\u00a0of \nintermediate goods and machinery are not likely to \ngrow, as the PRC is seen reducing its total imports and \nother economies face lackluster external demand, and \nbusiness sentiment has yet to pick up. Growth in imports \nto South\u00a0Asia, projected at 4.3% in aggregate, will re\ufb02ect \nimport\u00a0growth in more than half of the subregion\u2019s \neconomies.\n\nThe regional current account surplus widened to \nequal 2.9% of combined GDP in 2015 from 2.3% in 2014 as \nimports shrank more sharply than exports (Figure\u00a01.1.17). \nThis year, the regional current account surplus will \nshrink to 2.6% of GDP with continuing declines in global \noil prices, tight external demand, worsening current \naccount de\ufb01cits in oil-exporting countries, and narrowing \nsurpluses in the larger Asian economies on account of weak \nmanufacturing exports. Next year, the expected rebound in \nglobal commodity prices will narrow the aggregate de\ufb01cit \nin Central Asia, but the larger East\u00a0and Southeast Asian \nsubregions are likely to post lower surpluses, thus\u00a0further \nnarrowing the region-wide aggregate current account \nsurplus to 2.4% of GDP.\n\nThe declining trend in developing Asia\u2019s current \naccount surplus parallels the global picture. The global \ncurrent account surplus narrowed marginally from 1.1% of \nworld\u00a0GDP in 2014 to 1.0% in\u00a02015 (Figure 1.1.18).

Despite growth \nslippage and stagnation over the next 2 years, the region \nwill continue to account for a huge share of global growth, \nat\u00a060%, close to its average share over the past 5 years.\n\nSoft global demand and restructuring in the PRC will \n\n2015\n2016\n2017\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\ntemper growth in East Asia from 6.0% in 2015 to 5.7% \nin 2016. The Republic of Korea will record steady growth this year, \naccelerating next year in tandem with improving global demand. \nGrowth in Taipei,China will edge up this year and next, supported by \nrising government investment. Both Mongolia and Hong Kong, China \nwill see growth slow this year and pick up only mildly next year, as \ndeceleration in the PRC weighs heavily on their prospects. \n\nGrowth in Southeast Asia will accelerate to 4.5% this year and \n4.8% next. The trend will be led by Indonesia as it raises investment \nand undertakes policy reform. Economic recovery in Thailand will \ngradually move forward over the next 2 years, bolstered by public \ninvestment. In\u00a0the Philippines, solid growth will come from both \nprivate\u00a0consumption and investment. As growth strengthens in the \nsubregion, half of its economies are forecast to expand by at least 6.0% \nover the next 2 years. \n\nSouth Asia will continue to see robust growth this year and next. \nAs\u00a0in the past year, this subregion will be the fastest-growing in Asia \nin the next 2 years. Despite the unfavorable external environment, \ngrowth will slip only mildly to 6.9% in 2016 as India enjoys solid \nthough moderating growth and as expansion gains speed in six other \nsubregional economies. Next year, growth in the subregion will surge \nto 7.3% as it quickens to 7.8% in India and accelerates in all other \nsubregional economies except Bhutan.\n\nThe expected further drop in oil and gas prices will, along with \nlower remittances from a Russian Federation still mired in recession, \ndrag down growth in Central Asia to 2.1% this year from 2.9% last year. \nGrowth will slow in all economies except Turkmenistan, where it is \nexpected to hold steady. Subregional growth will bounce back next year \nto 2.8% along with a recovery in global commodity prices.\n\nIn the Paci\ufb01c, growth will plunge by almost half this year, dragged \ndown by abrupt deceleration in the heavily weighted PNG from 9.9% in \n2015 to 4.3% as prospects are further dampened by falling commodity \nprices. Growth in Fiji is poised to be lower this year following the \ndevastating Tropical Cyclone Winston this February.

In\ufb02ation\u00a0will \nrise this year on account of strengthening domestic demand \nand next year on recovery for global commodity prices. \nIn\u00a0the PRC, further price deregulation will help drive \nin\ufb02ation higher to the forecast horizon. Aggregate in\ufb02ation in \nEast\u00a0Asia will rise steadily in both years but remain benign. \nIn South and Southeast Asia, in\ufb02ation will hold somewhat \nsteady in 2016 but accelerate in 2017. In Central Asia, elevated \nin\ufb02ation this year will come partly from higher prices for \nimported goods following widespread currency depreciation, \nbut in\ufb02ationary pressures will ease in 2017. Higher in\ufb02ation \nin the Paci\ufb01c is forecast in light of the risk of currency \ndepreciation in PNG and the expectation of strong domestic \ndemand in the other economies.\n\n2015\n2016\n2017\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\nRisks to the outlook \nAgainst the backdrop of a difficult and uncertain global environment, \nrisks to the outlook for this year clearly tilt toward the downside. \nWhile growth may still pleasantly surprise, upside risks to the forecast \nare few. On the other hand, the downside risks are formidable: slower \nPRC growth, higher US interest rates, volatile global \ufb01nancial markets, \nsharp slowdowns in commodity-producing economies, and general \nsluggishness in emerging markets.\n\nFurther US interest rate hikes may heighten global risk aversion, \n\nespecially when viewing emerging markets in light of their slower \ngrowth. Heightened risk aversion may trigger in turn large and volatile \ncapital \ufb02ow reversals from emerging markets. Global \ufb01nancial markets \nhave shown a great deal of volatility since the beginning of the year. \nAlthough the US Federal Reserve has refrained from further interest \nrate hikes since December 2015, chances are that further rate hikes will \ncome this year. Tightening global liquidity could conspire with a broader \nemerging market slowdown to produce febrile and tense conditions in \nglobal \ufb01nancial markets. Further, higher US rates may cause an already \nstrong US dollar to appreciate even more. This would raise the value \nof foreign debt in local currency terms, posing risks to economies with \nlarge debts.\n\nAn unexpectedly sharp growth slowdown in the PRC could have \n\nmajor implications for the regional outlook. The PRC is now the \nworld\u2019s second largest economy, which means that its growth rate \nmatters not only to the region\u2014especially to the East and Southeast \nAsian economies that have close economic links with the PRC\u2014but \nalso to the world. Indeed, before the current slowdown, robust growth \nin the PRC had been a major positive factor in the global economy. \nThe\u00a0slowdown is not a major concern in and of itself, as it derives partly \nfrom a natural, healthy, and welcome transition to more sustainable and \nbalanced growth rates. However, if the transition is poorly managed and \ndeceleration starts to spiral, the adverse impact will be substantial. \n\n\fRescuing growth in uncertain times\u2002\u200215\n\nAs developing Asia as a whole is a major net importer of \n\n1.1.21\u2002GDP growth, developing economies\n\n2008\u20132012\n2013\u20132015\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\noil and other commodities, it should bene\ufb01t from current \nweakness in global\u00a0commodity prices. However, oil- and \ncommodity-dependent economies in the region, especially \nin Central Asia and the Paci\ufb01c, are hurt by the global \ncommodity slump. In addition, Asian economies that export \na lot to commodity-dependent countries such as oil-exporters \nin the Middle\u00a0East, or depend on them for workers\u2019 \nremittances, will suffer losses. So the slump is not con\ufb01ned \nto commodity producers. The broad slowdown of emerging \nmarkets may harm the region\u2019s export and growth prospects \n(Figure 1.1.21). \n\nThe economic effects of El Ni\u00f1o are unpredictable. \nWhile\u00a0they vary by country, and with each occurrence of \nEl Ni\u00f1o, they may be substantially negative for some Asian \neconomies. El\u00a0Ni\u00f1o often signi\ufb01cantly lowers rainfall in \nAsia and sometimes causes severe drought. As such, it poses \ngreater risks to economies with relatively large primary \nsectors\u2014agriculture, \ufb01shing, and mining\u2014and to economies \nthat are less diversi\ufb01ed.\n\nProducer price de\ufb02ation is emerging as a new threat in some \nAsian economies. Developing Asia\u2019s growth slowdown since the \nglobal \ufb01nancial crisis has subdued in\ufb02ationary pressures, which are \neven weaker with the recent slide in global prices for oil and other \ncommodities. While low in\ufb02ation gives Asian central banks greater \nscope for countercyclical monetary expansion designed to boost growth, \nit raises concerns about crossing the line into de\ufb02ation. In\u00a0fact, while \nconsumer prices are still rising, albeit more slowly, producer prices are \nactually falling in some Asian economies. As of February\u00a02016, producer \nprices had declined for 48\u00a0consecutive months in the PRC. Empirical \nanalysis suggests that a negative relationship may hold between \nproducer price de\ufb02ation and economic growth. To avoid sliding into a \nlow-growth trap, Asian policy makers would do well to monitor not only \nconsumer prices but also producer\u00a0prices. \n\nDeveloping\neconomies\n\nLatin America\nand the\nCaribbean\n\nMiddle East\nand\nNorth\u00a0Africa\n\nSub-Saharan\nAfrica\n\nDeveloping\nAsia\n\nNote: Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, and \nSub-Saharan Africa are classi\ufb01cations in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s \nWorld\u00a0Economic Outlook database. \u201cDeveloping economies\u201d combine these \nregions with developing Asia.\nSources: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook database, \nOctober 2015; Asian Development Outlook database; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f16\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nSpillover from the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China\n\nThe analysis above identi\ufb01es economic slowdown in the PRC as a major \ndownside risk to developing Asia\u2019s outlook. The magnitude of the risk \ndepends critically on how much growth moderates, as the analysis \nbelow shows. In addition to slowing down, the PRC is undergoing a \nstructural transformation with signi\ufb01cant external effects. While the \neffect on other economies is likely negative in the immediate future, \neconomies that adapt quickly to the new circumstances can reap future \ngrowth dividends. \n\nEffects of growth moderation in the PRC\nGrowth in the PRC has been slowing and is expected to \ncontinue to slow over the medium term. The PRC growth \nrate was only 6.9% in 2015, almost half a percentage point \nbelow 2014 and, for the \ufb01rst time in a quarter of a century, \nlower than 7.0% on an annual basis. Moderation has been a \ncontinuous downward drift by a total of 2.6 percentage points \nsince 2011. A slowdown was expected, but its extent keeps \nsurprising, as seen in repeated downward revisions to growth \nforecasts (Figure 1.2.1). \n\nA recent study examines the external impact of \n\n7\n\n6\n\n2011\n\nslowdown in the PRC (Abiad et al. 2016). It re\ufb02ects several \n\ufb02uid structural factors. First, the PRC working-age \npopulation aged 15\u201359 started to shrink in 2012, and this \ndemographic shift will drag on growth increasingly in the \nyears to come. Second, the PRC economy is shifting away \nfrom industry and toward services on the supply side, and \naway from investment and toward consumption on the \ndemand side. The decline in the contributions to growth \nfrom industry and investment is under way, but the rise in \ncontributions from services and consumption growth has not yet fully \noffset the decline. Third, a natural process of convergence predicts \nthat growth will slow as per capita income rises and as return on \ninvestment diminishes. The PRC has converged quickly in the past \nquarter century, with real GDP per capita rising ninefold since 1990. \nAs labor costs have soared, the PRC has lost some of its attraction as a \nbase for low-cost manufacturing.

PRC expansionary policy after 2010 increased \ninvestment and spending on infrastructure and substantially eased \ncredit conditions to support growth. Partly because of this, debt \nhas risen substantially since 2008, much of it channeled through \nunregulated shadow banks. This debt helped fuel overinvestment \nand excess capacity in certain sectors such as steel, as well as sharp \nincreases in asset values. To contain these vulnerabilities, PRC \nauthorities began paring back investment and tightening credit in \nmid-2013, which contributed to the slowdown. They reversed course in \nmid-2015, however, when growth seemed to be slowing more sharply \nthan anticipated or desired. \n\nonly modest impact on the US and Europe. Using the Global \nProjection Model, which models multiple blocks of economies \nto comprehensively and coherently generate global forecasts, \nAbiad et al. (2016) assessed the effects of the current PRC \nslowdown using \u201cno slowdown\u201d as the counterfactual \nscenario for comparison. Weaker PRC growth shaved almost \na third of a percentage point off developing Asia\u2019s growth \neach year and a \ufb01fth of a percentage point off Japan\u2019s \n(Figure 1.2.2). This re\ufb02ected strong intraregional trade and \nproduction linkages involving the PRC. In contrast, the \nimpact on the US and Europe was modest, as\u00a0their relatively \nsmall trade exposure to the PRC was offset by a boost from \nlower commodity prices. Global growth was almost a third \nof a percentage point lower than it would have been had the \nPRC economy not slowed. \n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.4\n\n\u20130.8\n\nCurrent worries that a sharp slowdown could strike in \nthe near term are exaggerated, as the PRC has substantial \npolicy buffers to respond to adverse shocks. Unlikely as such \na scenario is even in the medium term, it is nevertheless \nuseful to look at how it might affect Asia and the rest of the \nworld. A sharp growth slowdown could materialize after \none of the following events or, more likely, a combination of \nthem: an unwinding of the credit boom, the bursting of asset \nmarket bubbles in real estate or \ufb01nancial markets, a sharp and sustained \ndrop in\u00a0investment, and worsening \ufb01nancial fragilities snowballing into \na full-blown \ufb01nancial crisis. \n\nRecords of historical events from around the world show disorderly \n\nslowdowns from credit booms going bust, housing downturns, and \n\ufb01nancial crises slashing investment by about 10 percentage points \nas imbalances unwind (Table 1.2.1). Private and public consumption \ngrowth tends to decelerate as well, private by about 2 percentage points \nand public by 1 point. The typical decline in GDP growth during such \ndisorderly slowdowns is by about 2\u20133 percentage points. However, \nbecause investment is a much larger share of GDP in the PRC than \nin most other economies, a decline in investment and consumption \ngrowth similar in size to past episodes in other economies would \nhave larger effects in the PRC, taking about 4.5 percentage points off \ngrowth.

As a result of its shift from investment-led growth \nto consumption-led growth, the PRC may import more\u00a0consumption \ngoods such as cosmetics, for example, and fewer investment goods such \nas machinery. Moreover, the PRC role in global value chains is changing. \nRising wages have shifted some activities to lower-cost economies, and \ntechnological upgrades have and will move the PRC into activities that \nadd more value. This\u00a0transformation affects the types of intermediate \ngoods imported into the PRC for further processing. And, as the PRC \nshifts growth away from exports to domestic demand, its role as an \nimporter and assembler will decline and, with it, its imports of parts \nand\u00a0components.\n\nThe rapid integration of the PRC into global value chains (GVCs) \nlinking it to other East and Southeast Asian economies has bolstered its \nexport success. The economy has positioned itself at the downstream \nend of the value chain, importing intermediate goods to assemble \ufb01nal \nproducts speci\ufb01cally for export to the US and elsewhere. Traditionally, \n\n\feconomies that are technologically more advanced, such \nas Japan and the Republic of Korea, design the \ufb01nal goods \nand produce the more exacting parts and components that \nless advanced economies like the PRC then assemble into \n\ufb01nal goods for export. But the role of the PRC in GVCs is \nchanging, as its growing technological capacity increasingly \nenables it to produce more parts and components itself, \nreducing its dependence on imports from neighboring \ncountries. \n\nAt the same time, the PRC is rebalancing from investment \n\ntoward consumption. The contributions of consumption, \ninvestment, government spending, and net exports to \neconomic growth are considered here toward determining \nif the contribution of investment has been declining while \nthe contributions of other components such as consumption \nhave been rising. Figure 1.2.4 presents the contributions of \nconsumption, investment, and net exports to GDP growth. \nInvestment made the biggest contribution in most years from \n2001, until it peaked at 86% in 2009. The contribution of total \nconsumption, both public and private, has been rising since \na dip in 2006 and has overtaken investment to contribute \nmore than half of GDP growth. This supports the notion of \na structural\u00a0transformation in the PRC from an economy led \nby\u00a0investment to\u00a0one\u00a0led by consumption. \n\nStructural change has altered the position of the \nPRC in GVCs, as\u00a0quanti\ufb01ed by its GVC participation rate. \nThis measure has two\u00a0parts: the\u00a0backward participation \nrate, which gauges the extent of foreign value added in a \nparticular economy\u2019s exports, and the forward participation \nrate, which measures how much of the economy\u2019s domestic \nvalue added is included in the exports of other economies. \nAs shown in Table\u00a01.2.2, the share of foreign value added \nin PRC exports was 33.3% in 1995, increasing to 37.4% in \n2005, but then falling back to 32.1% in 2011 as the share \nof imported intermediate goods in PRC exports declined. \nMeanwhile, PRC value added embodied in foreign exports \nhas\u00a0steadily risen from 9.5% in 1995 to 15.6% in 2011 as the \nPRC increasingly supplied intermediate products. \n\nStructural transformation is re\ufb02ected in the types of \n\ngoods the PRC imports. Figure 1.2.5 plots the share of \nconsumption goods versus parts and components in total \nimports of the PRC from 1995 to 2014. The\u00a0share of parts and \ncomponents in total imports shows an inverted U\u00a0pattern \nwith its peak at 39% in 2006 before falling off to 29% in 2014. \nThis pattern is consistent with the timing of the rise and fall \nof GVC backward linkages detailed in Table\u00a01.2.2. In contrast, \nthe share of consumption goods in imports has stayed \nrelatively \ufb02at, though there has been a slight uptick from its \n3.2% trough in 2004 to 4.9% in 2014. \n\nSpillover from structural transformation in the PRC into \nparticular economies depends on whether they are exporters \n\n180\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\n\u201360\n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nRescuing growth in uncertain times\u2002\u200219\n\n1.2.4\u2002 Contributions to GDP growth  \n\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nConsumption\nInvestment\nNet exports\n\nPercentage share\n\nGDP growth\n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n1980 1990 2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2014\n\nNotes: The contribution to GDP growth is based on real values.

At\u00a0this\u00a0stage, \nthe\u00a0shift to a larger contribution to growth from consumption \nhas not translated into a marked increase in the import of \nconsumption goods. While domestic producers can still \nlargely meet demand from PRC consumers, there may be \nopportunities for lower-cost producers to make inroads into \nthe PRC, likely initially in the market for lower-end goods \nwhere there is more price sensitivity. \n\nThe share of parts and components in PRC imports began \ndecline in 2006. Figure 1.2.6 plots the change in import share \nagainst the change in parts and components share from 2006 \nto 2014 for eight major economies in East and Southeast \nAsia. Each selected economy provided more than 1% of PRC \nimports in 2014. Viet Nam appears to be gaining market share \nas a GVC partner. This may be related to PRC \ufb01rms moving \noffshore in line with the structural changes at home, as the \nexecution of lower-skill production activities is increasingly \nmoving to sites with lower labor costs. At the other end of \nthe scale, advanced economies like the Republic of Korea \nand Hong Kong, China have seen their market shares eroded. \nThis is consistent with the PRC shifting toward the high end \nof the GVC and its burgeoning role as a producer of parts and \ncomponents.\n\nA major catalyst of structural change in the PRC is a labor \n\nforce that is shrinking and becoming more costly. The loss \nof the economy\u2019s competitive advantage in labor-intensive \nindustries presents opportunities for economies that compete \nwith the PRC primarily in third markets (Figure 1.2.7). \nThese competitors can increase market share as the PRC \nwithdraws. Bangladesh is already gaining market share as \nthe PRC withdraws from low-end garment manufacturing, \nfor example, and is now the world\u2019s second-largest garment \nexporter, after the PRC.\n\nConcluding observations on PRC effects\nStructural adjustment in the PRC has a short-term impact \non the region that is negative. Simulations show that growth \nmoderation in the PRC is expected to shave 0.3 percentage \npoints from developing Asia\u2019s growth. Structural change will \nmagnify the short-term impacts that growth moderation has \non the exports of neighboring economies. However, in\u00a0the \nmedium term, structural transformation in the PRC may \nopen up new export opportunities for economies in Asia and \naround the world. The economies that are better at catering \nto growing consumption and domestic demand in the PRC \nwill enjoy more success in exporting to that market.\n\nCambodia\nViet Nam\nBangladesh\nSri Lanka\nPakistan\nHong Kong, China\nNepal\nPhilippines\nRepublic of Korea\nTonga\nThailand\nMalaysia\nIndia\nSingapore\nSamoa\nIndonesia\nFiji\nMaldives\nTimor\u2212Leste\nBhutan\nKyrgyz Republic\nArmenia\nGeorgia\nAfghanistan\nTuvalu\nCook Islands\nVanuatu\nSolomon Islands\nMyanmar\nTajikistan\nPapua New Guinea\nTurkmenistan\nKazakhstan\nBrunei Darussalam\nMongolia\nAzerbaijan\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nIndex\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: The index of competition measures the importance of the PRC in an \neconomy\u2019s export markets, weighted by product, with 100 indicating total \ndominance and 0\u00a0indicating complete absence.

Once con\ufb01ned in Asia to Japan, de\ufb02ation has spread to \nother East and Southeast Asian economies, as well as to India. The\u00a0recent \ndecline in global oil prices and slower economic growth have subdued \nin\ufb02ationary pressures to the point that producer prices began to fall \nin some economies. As of February 2016, the PRC had experienced \n48\u00a0consecutive months of producer price de\ufb02ation. Fears\u00a0are growing \nthat de\ufb02ation in PRC will be transmitted to its neighbors through lower \nprices for PRC exports. Already in 2015, producer price de\ufb02ation was \nevident in the region, even though consumer price in\ufb02ation remained \nlargely positive (Table 1.3.1). Further,\u00a0external demand for the region\u2019s \nproducts remains subdued, exerting further downward pressure on \nprices.

Theory and evidence\nThe traditional view is that de\ufb02ation is a danger to be avoided at \nall\u00a0costs (e.g., Fisher 1933, Friedman and Schwartz 1963). De\ufb02ation \nmakes domestic currency debts that are not indexed to prices, which in \npractice means most domestic currency debts, more difficult to service \nand repay. These difficulties create in turn balance sheet problems \nand losses for creditors, especially banks and other institutional \ninvestors. As debtors tighten their belts to avoid costly default, \n\ufb01rms\u00a0curtail investment projects, and households limit their spending. \nThe\u00a0expectation of falling prices tempts even \ufb01nancially healthy \ufb01rms \nand households to delay investment and consumption in anticipation of \nstill lower prices in the future. For all these reasons, de\ufb02ation threatens \nto persist and gather momentum from the moment it emerges. \n\nHowever, prices can decline not just because of negative demand \n\nshocks but also because of positive supply shocks. Indeed, benign \npositive supply shock was the dominant explanation for producer price \nde\ufb02ation in the PRC for as long as that economy was growing strongly. \nEmpirical estimates in Borio et al. (2015) support the benign view. \n\nLooking at the association between the consumer price index (CPI) \nand the rate of GDP growth per capita since 1870 in a wide range of \neconomies, the study found few signi\ufb01cant differences in the rate of \nGDP growth between periods of in\ufb02ation and de\ufb02ation, the notable \nexception being the decade of the Great Depression starting in 1929, \nwhen both output and prices collapsed. The implication is that \nresearchers have inappropriately generalized the experience of an \nexceptional period when de\ufb02ation was extremely rapid and persistent to \nother circumstances where it is not applicable.\n\nBut the CPI may be less relevant to the decision making and \n\nbehavior of producers than is the producer price index (PPI). \nBy\u00a0de\ufb01nition, the CPI measures price changes from the vantage of the \nbuyer, while the PPI measures them from the vantage of the seller. \nThis\u00a0distinction may cause the two price indexes to behave differently. \nSeller and purchaser prices will differ because of government subsidies, \nsales and excise taxes, and distribution costs. Insofar as taxes, subsidies, \nand perhaps also distribution costs are slow to change, consumer prices \nmay exhibit less volatility and more persistence than producer prices. \nChanges in international commodity prices also seem to affect producer \nprices and consumer prices differently, with a greater rate of pass-\nthrough to producers (Box 1.3.1).\n\nIf one is interested in the impact of de\ufb02ation on production \n\ndecisions, it makes sense to focus on producer prices. If one is interested \nin spending decisions, it makes sense to consider consumer prices and \nproducer prices in combination, because, while consumer prices are the \nmost relevant to the spending decisions of households, both are relevant \nto the spending decisions of \ufb01rms. It is therefore worthwhile to revisit \nthe association between de\ufb02ation and economic growth using producer \nprices rather than consumer prices to see if the benign supply-shock \nview still holds.\n\n\fRescuing growth in uncertain times\u2002\u200223\n\n1.3.1\u2002Higher commodity price pass-through for producer prices \n\nIt is widely believed that the recent weakness in global oil \nand food prices helped contain inflationary pressures in \nAsian countries. Yet the effect of global commodity prices \nmay differ for domestic producer prices, which are more \nrelevant for producers, and consumer prices, which are \nmore relevant for consumers. For both kinds of prices, \nthe effect is determined by the extent of pass-through, or \nwhat portion of a rise or fall in global prices is eventually \nreflected in domestic prices.\n\nJongwanich, Wongcharoen, and Park (forthcoming) \nempirically analyzed the relationship between global oil \nand\u00a0food prices and domestic producer and consumer prices \nin a sample of developing economies in Asia. The analysis \nis based on quarterly data, and it yields some interesting \ninsights into the pass-through of global oil and food prices \nin the region.\n\nThe impact of global oil price changes on domestic prices \n\nis diluted along the distribution chain. The pass-through \ntends to be smaller for consumer prices than for producer \nprices. For example, in the PRC, the cumulative pass-through \n\nof a 1% drop in global oil prices after 4 quarters reached \n14\u00a0basis points for producer prices but only 3 basis points for \nconsumer prices (box figure). \n\nPart of the difference in the reaction between consumer \n\nand producer prices could arise from the different weight \neach index places on oil-derived products. The share of \nfuel and related petroleum products is generally more than \n50% in producer prices but only around 30% in consumer \nprices. More generally, the share of tradable products is \nnoticeably higher in producer prices. The gap between \nthese two price indexes in each economy depends on \nthe ability of firms to pass higher costs on to consumers. \nFor example, private producers facing intense market \ncompetition may decide to cut their profit margins rather \nthan try to charge consumers higher prices in the short \nterm. Government policy measures such as fuel subsidies \ndesigned to help consumer pocketbooks may reduce or \ndelay the pass-through of oil price changes to consumer \nprice inflation, thereby widening the gap between producer \nand consumer prices. \n\nOil and food price pass-through\n\nProducer price index\nConsumer price index\n\nOil price pass-through, People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nOil price pass-through, Thailand\n\n%\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n%\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n%\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n%\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFood price pass-through, People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nFood price pass-through, Thailand\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nNote: The horizontal axes refer to quarterly periods.\nSource: Jongwanich, Wongcharoen, and Park, forthcoming.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\ncontinued on the next page\n\n\f24\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\n1.3.1\u2002Continued \n\nThe pass-through of oil prices to producer prices \ntends to be higher in oil-exporting economies than in oil \nimporters. In Malaysia, an oil exporter, the pass-through \nof a 1% change in global oil prices to producers gradually \nincreases from 12 basis points in the first quarter to reach \na cumulative total of 21 basis points in the fourth quarter. \nFor oil-importing economies, the cumulative annual pass-\nthrough of oil prices to producer prices is somewhat \nsmaller. Singapore is an exceptional case in which the \npass-through to producer prices is high because of the high \nintensity of oil use in total energy consumption, and possibly \nbecause Singapore re-exports a lot of refined oil products. \nAlthough Indonesia, the PRC, and Thailand import less \nthan the Republic of Korea or Hong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China, their \npass-through of world oil prices to producer prices tends \nto be higher. This could reflect superior energy efficiency \nin the Republic of Korea, where the ratio of total energy \nconsumption to GDP in 2011 was 10.7%, and in Hong Kong, \nChina, where the ratio was 5.7%. \n\nAs in the case of world oil prices, the impact of world \nfood price changes on domestic prices is diluted along the \ndistribution chain. The pass-through tends to be lower for \nconsumer prices than for producer prices. Significantly, \nthe gap between the two price indexes tends to be higher \nfor food prices than for oil prices. That is, the relatively \n\nlarger impact of global prices on domestic producer prices \nis more pronounced for food than for oil. For example, in \nThailand, the cumulative pass-through in 4 quarters of a 1% \nincrease in global food prices is 21 basis points for producer \nprices but only 7 basis points for consumer prices. Many \nAsian governments still impose price controls and provide \nsubsidies for households, which constrain the ability of \nproducers to pass costs on to consumers. \n\nIn sum, the analysis indicates that the pass-through \nof global oil and food prices is higher for producer prices \nthan for consumer prices. This supports the notion that \nthe two\u00a0prices behave differently and are determined by \ndifferent factors. In addition, the higher pass-through for \nproducer prices in developing Asia raises the possibility that \nthe recent decline in global oil and food prices has a bigger \neffect on producer prices than on consumer prices, which \nis consistent with the higher incidence of producer price \ndeflation than consumer price deflation currently besetting \nthe region.\n\nReference\nJongwanich, J., P.

(2015) by enlarging the dataset with data on producer price \nindexes. Table 1.3.2 shows summary statistics for both CPI and PPI \nin\ufb02ation and de\ufb02ation in different eras and under different monetary \nregimes. Following Borio et al., the more recent study excludes \nobservations from the war years 1914\u20131918 and 1939\u20131945 and, in the case \nof Spain, observations from the civil war years 1936\u20131939. It also excludes \nobservations from years with extreme in\ufb02ation higher than 100%. \n\nThe correlation between the change in the PPI and the CPI, at 0.88, \nis relatively high. There are well more than twice as many years of PPI \nas CPI de\ufb02ation after World War II, while the number of years of PPI \nand CPI in\ufb02ation in earlier periods is much more similar. This suggests \nthat looking solely at CPI is likely to be especially problematic when \nanalyzing the years since World War II.\n\nPersistent de\ufb02ation is de\ufb01ned, following Borio et al., as a period \nfollowing a price peak when prices fail to recover to the peak for at least \n5 years. More years of de\ufb02ation of this persistent type were identi\ufb01ed \nusing the PPI rather than the CPI. In the postwar period, there are only \n5 instances of persistent CPI de\ufb02ation in the 38 economies in the sample \nbut 29 instances of PPI de\ufb02ation. Again, this encourages looking at both \nthe PPI and the CPI, especially in the period following World War II.\n\n\fRescuing growth in uncertain times\u2002\u200225\n\n1.3.2\u2002Overview of periods of consumer and producer price index deflation\n\nConsumer\n\nProducer\n\nNumber of inflation years\n\nNumber of deflation years\n\nNumber of inflation years\n\nNumber of deflation years\n\nConsumer Number of episodes\n\nProducer\n\nNumber of episodes\n\nAll deflation\n\nPersistent deflation\n\nCorrelation\n\nAll\n\nFull sample \n(1870\u20132014)\n\nPostwar \n(1947\u20132014)\n\n2,940\n\n658\n\n2,443\n\n921\n\n76\n\n92\n\n0.88\n\n2,332\n\n145\n\n1,914\n\n389\n\n5\n\n29\n\n0.92\n\nNote: The 38 economies in the sample are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, \nthe\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, \nthe Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, \nPortugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, \nthe\u00a0United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Hong Kong, China.

Over the full sample, growth is signi\ufb01cantly slower \nin periods of de\ufb02ation than in periods of either high or low in\ufb02ation, \nwhether in\ufb02ation is measured using the PPI or the CPI.\n\nTable 1.3.4 uses regression analysis to relate in\ufb02ation and de\ufb02ation \n\nto economic growth. Following Borio et al. (2015), panel regressions \nare estimated with country \ufb01xed effects to allow differences across \neconomies. Changes in equity prices are included, as in Borio et al., \nto capture and control for the separate effects of asset price de\ufb02ation. \nIn the full sample, the coefficients on the change in both the CPI and \nthe PPI are positive and highly signi\ufb01cant, which is consistent with \nthe idea that de\ufb02ation is bad for economic growth. But for the CPI, \nall the explanatory power derives from the association of de\ufb02ation \nwith recession in the interwar period. This suggests that CPI de\ufb02ation \ndepressed growth only during the Great Depression. This is consistent \nwith the \ufb01ndings of Borio et al.\n\nThe picture is different, however, for the PPI. Changes in the PPI \n\nare\u00a0signi\ufb01cantly related to growth, not just in the interwar period \nbut also under the classical gold standard and since World\u00a0War\u00a0II. \nThis\u00a0result suggests that the harmful effect of de\ufb02ation on growth was \nnot con\ufb01ned to the Great Depression.\n\nRestricting the sample to include only years with low in\ufb02ation at less \n\nthan 1% does not change the results materially. Why is producer price \nde\ufb02ation potentially harmful? One possibility is that it compounds the \ndebt burden on producers and thus discourages investment. \n\nOne of the most important decisions facing producers is investment. \nOne can expect producer prices to affect producers\u2019 decision making and \n\n\fRescuing growth in uncertain times\u2002\u200227\n\n1.3.1\u2002 Relationship between changes in the PPI  \n\nand changes in investment \n\nChanges in log investment\n\n\u20130.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\nChanges in log PPI\n\nPPI = producer price index.\nNotes: For economies without a PPI, the wholesale price index is used. \nThe\u00a0country quarter data is grouped into 50 groups of equal size along the \nx-axis.

Han\u00a0and \nWei (forthcoming) explored the relationship between \nproducer price de\ufb02ation and investment. Figure 1.3.1 plots the \nquarterly changes in the PPI against changes in investment in \nthe following quarter. In de\ufb02ationary periods when the PPI \nfell, there is a clear positive relationship between changes in \nthe PPI and changes in investment. That is, contraction in \ninvestment followed PPI de\ufb02ation. \n\n \n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n\n\u20130.06\n\n\u20130.02\n\n\u20130.04\n\nHan and Wei (forthcoming) examined whether \nPPI de\ufb02ation causes investment contraction, using an \nautoregressive model (the change in investment being the \ndependent variable, and lagged changes in investment and \nthe PPI the independent variables) with quarterly panel \ndata from 1966 to 2014. PPI de\ufb02ation was found to cause \nsigni\ufb01cant changes in investment. Among economies \nin which the PPI signi\ufb01cantly affected investment, 71% \nexperienced investment declines following PPI de\ufb02ation. \nDuring in\ufb02ationary periods, the impact of in\ufb02ation on \ninvestment was much weaker. Only 42% of economies \nshowing signi\ufb01cant effects experienced investment expansion \nduring PPI in\ufb02ation. When considering persistence\u2014de\ufb01ned \nas the PPI declining for at least 4 consecutive quarters\u2014an additional \n5% of countries were signi\ufb01cantly affected. Persistent de\ufb02ation was thus \nmore damaging for investment.\n\n\u20130.04\n\nDebts are an additional concern. Fisher (1933) pioneered the \nargument that debt and de\ufb02ation were the major causes of economic \ndepressions. De\ufb02ation raises the real value of debt, forcing debt \nliquidation that generates pessimism that feeds back into more de\ufb02ation. \nThe vicious spiral of de\ufb02ation and debt liquidation may suppress \ninvestment, output, trade, and employment. \n\nIntroducing changes in the ratio of debt to GDP into the analysis, \nHan and Wei (forthcoming) found that investments were signi\ufb01cantly \naffected by the joint effect of de\ufb02ation and debt. The mix of higher debt \nand de\ufb02ation reduced investment in 45% of the economies. The current \nwave of PPI de\ufb02ation may depress or postpone investment, all the more \nso if debts also rise. Therefore, some grounds exist for concern over \neconomies facing de\ufb02ation and rising debt. \n\nConcluding observations on de\ufb02ation\nThe analysis suggests that policy makers in developing Asia should \nbe aware of the potential harm to economic growth from de\ufb02ation. \nLong-run historical data show de\ufb02ation being negatively associated \nwith economic growth. More in-depth regression analysis con\ufb01rms \nthe association between de\ufb02ation and growth, which is stronger for \nproducer price de\ufb02ation than for consumer price de\ufb02ation. \n\nChanges in the CPI are more relevant to consumers, but changes \nin the PPI are more relevant to producers, so it is best to consider both \nwhen assessing the effect of de\ufb02ation on growth. Interestingly, there \nare more episodes of persistent de\ufb02ation, including since the middle \nof the 20th century, when viewed using the PPI rather than the CPI. \n\n\f28\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nFurther, producer prices tend to be more volatile than consumer prices. \nThe present analysis shows that changes in the PPI are signi\ufb01cantly and \ninversely related to growth, in both the full sample period 1870\u20132014 \nand the postwar period 1947\u20132014. Controlling for asset price booms \nand busts does not alter the conclusions about the potential dangers of \nde\ufb02ation.\n\nFinally, it is important to acknowledge that high in\ufb02ation as well \n\nas de\ufb02ation can have negative impact on economic growth, as this \nresult comes through clearly in the data. In fact, in\ufb02ation was the \nmuch larger concern in developing Asia until the recent emergence of \nde\ufb02ation, mostly producer price de\ufb02ation, in some regional economies. \nThe\u00a0evidence, while far from de\ufb01nitive, suggests that it would be \nprudent for the region\u2019s monetary authorities to keep an eye on de\ufb02ation \nas well as in\ufb02ation, and on producer prices as well as consumer prices. \nEmpirical analysis of the de\ufb02ation\u2013growth nexus is a relatively new \nline of inquiry. The preliminary nature of the analysis calls for caution \nin interpreting the \ufb01ndings, but the \ufb01ndings suggest fertile ground for \nfurther research.\n\nReferences\nAbiad, A., M. Lee, M.

These\u00a0economies \nare forecast to expand in aggregate by 1.8% in 2016, the same rate as in \n2015, before inching up to 1.9% in 2017. Despite continued private\u00a0sector \nexpansion in the US, feeble global prospects point to US growth mildly \nslowing this year. While recovery in the euro area is gradually gaining \nground, domestic and external risks abound and therefore argue for \na growth forecast unchanged from last year. Japanese growth will \nimprove slightly, helped by a pickup in private consumption this \nyear in anticipation of a value-added tax (VAT) increase next year. \nFurther\u00a0declines in food and fuel prices in 2016 and a mild rebound in \n2017 will keep in\ufb02ationary pressures low and challenge central bankers \nin the euro\u00a0area and Japan to avoid de\ufb02ation (Table\u00a0A1.1). \n\nA1.1\u2002Baseline assumptions on the international economy\n\nGDP growth (%)\nMajor industrial economiesa\n\nUnited States\n\nEuro area\n\nJapan\n\nPrices and in\ufb02ation\n\nBrent crude spot prices (average, $\u00a0per\u00a0barrel)\n\nFood index (2010 = 100, % change)\n\nConsumer price index in\ufb02ation  \n\n(major industrial economies\u2019 average, %)\n\nInterest rates\n\nUnited States federal funds rate (average, %)\n\nEuropean Central Bank re\ufb01nancing rate (average, %)\n\nBank of Japan overnight call rate (average, %)\n$ Liborb (%)\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nActual  Estimate\n\nADO 2016 \nProjection\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20022.4\n\n\u20020.9\n\n\u20020.0\n\n98.9\n\n\u20137.2\n\n\u20021.3\n\n\u20020.1\n\n\u20020.2\n\n\u20020.1\n\n\u20020.2\n\n\u2002\u20021.8\n\n\u2002\u20022.4\n\n\u2002\u20021.6\n\n\u2002\u20020.5\n\n\u200252.3\n\n\u201315.4\n\n\u2002\u20020.2\n\n\u2002\u20020.1\n\n\u2002\u20020.1\n\n\u2002\u20020.1\n\n\u2002\u20020.2\n\n\u20021.8\n\n\u20022.3\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20020.6\n\n38.0\n\n\u20131.0\n\n\u20021.1\n\n\u20020.6\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.6\n\n\u20021.9\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20021.6\n\n\u20020.5\n\n45.0\n\n\u20021.0\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20021.4\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20021.4\n\nADO = Asian Development Outlook, GDP = gross domestic product.\na\u2002Average growth rates are weighted by gross national income, Atlas method.\nb\u2002Average London interbank offered rate quotations on 1-month loans.\nSources: US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov; Eurostat,  \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat; Economic and Social Research Institute of Japan, http://www.esri.cao.\ngo.jp; Consensus Forecasts; Bloomberg; CEIC Data Company; Haver Analytics; and the World Bank, \nGlobal\u00a0Commodity Markets, http://www.worldbank.org; ADB estimates.\n\n\fUS economic activity in 2015 had a weak start, with \n\nA1.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth, United States\n\nPrivate expenditure\nPrivate investment\nGovernment expenditure and investment\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate\n\n30\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nRecent developments in the  \nmajor industrial economies\n\nUnited States\nThe US economy expanded by 2.4% in 2015. Private\u00a0consumption \nremains the main source of growth, contributing 2.1 percentage\u00a0points to \nthe annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate. Private\u00a0investment \nprovided 0.8 points to growth last year, slightly less than its contribution \nof 0.9\u00a0points in\u00a02014. The government sector contributed 0.1 points, after \nhaving acted as a drag since 2011.

While GDP growth recovered strongly to 3.9% \nin the second quarter, growth in the remainder of the year \nwas tepid, with all demand components soft in the fourth \nquarter (Figure A1.1). \n\nAfter revival in the second quarter, growth in private \nconsumption slowed for the rest of 2015 from a saar of 3.6% \nin the second quarter to 3.0% in the third and 2.0% in the \nfourth. The slowdown in the \ufb01nal quarter disappointed in \nlight of an improvement in wages, albeit slight, and a further \ndecline in gasoline prices. Retail sales remained \ufb02at in the \nsecond half of the year, and consumer con\ufb01dence slipped \nbelow the pre-recession level from February 2015 onward, \ndespite rising toward the end of the year (Figure A1.2). \nThese\u00a0trends suggest that private consumption, while not \nproviding strong support for growth, will continue to be an \nimportant driver and likely remain relatively stable.\n\nInvestment increased in the \ufb01rst half of 2015 but receded \n\nin the second, constrained by inventory accumulation and \nslowing \ufb01xed investment outside of housing. The purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index declined during the second half of the year \nto end at 54.9, which was still high enough to suggest further \nexpansion in manufacturing. The industrial production index \nremained above the pre-crisis level throughout 2015 despite \nending somewhat lower at 101.4 in December (2007 = 100). \nTrends in manufacturing and industrial production indicated \ncontinuing but slow gains in investment. \n\nThe labor market strengthened steadily during 2015. \nThe\u00a0unemployment rate improved rapidly, falling from\u00a05.7% \nin January 2015 to 5.0% in December and 4.9% at the \nbeginning of 2016. The average duration of unemployment \nalso shortened, from 32 weeks at the beginning of the \nyear to 28 weeks by the end of the year, though it edged \nup to 29\u00a0weeks at the beginning of 2016 (Figure A1.3). \nHowever, the\u00a0improved employment situation did not bring \nmuch increase in average earnings, as weekly earnings \n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n130\n\n110\n\n90\n\n70\n\n50\n\n30\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ = quarter.\nSources: US Department of Commerce.

This mixed picture was \nbroadly consistent with the slow improvement observed in \nmanufacturing, which remained sluggish but continued to \nadd jobs. \n\nIn\ufb02ation was muted, as both headline and core in\ufb02ation \n\nwere contained by US dollar appreciation and low energy \nprices. The fall in energy prices substantially reduced \nheadline in\ufb02ation early in 2015 and kept it low for almost \nthe entire year (Figure A1.4). Headline in\ufb02ation started \nto rise only toward the end of the year as the decline \nin energy prices slowed. Core in\ufb02ation rose slowly but \nsteadily throughout the year, consistent with a steady rise \nin consumption. The same trend continued through the \nbeginning of 2016, when the combination of steady core \nin\ufb02ation and slower declines in the energy prices raised \nheadline in\ufb02ation to an annual rate of 1.4%.\n\nIn December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board raised the \ntarget range of the federal funds rate for the \ufb01rst time since \nthe beginning of the global \ufb01nancial crisis. The rate remained \nconstant in January 2016, however, to keep monetary policy \naccommodative, with in\ufb02ation projected to stay low in the \nnear term and economic activity progressing only moderately. \nThe board is monitoring global economic and \ufb01nancial \ndevelopments closely to inform its future monetary policy. \nConditions\u00a0suggest that, unless US economic performance \nshows indisputable improvement, the policy rate is likely \nto remain unchanged for at least the \ufb01rst half of 2016. \nThe\u00a0policy rate is projected to average 0.6% in 2016 before \nrising to about 1.8% by the end of 2017. Thus, liquidity should \nremain loose in 2016.\n\nThe decision to maintain the policy rate and the resulting \n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\nchange in market expectations seem to have eased some \nof the pressure for the US dollar to appreciate. However, the strong \ndollar is still expected to drag on GDP growth by curbing net external \ndemand throughout the year. The\u00a0private sector is expected to continue \nexpanding but not strongly enough to substantially raise the economy\u2019s \ngrowth rate. The US economy is therefore projected to grow moderately, \nby 2.3% in 2016 and 2.5% in 2017. \n\nEuro area \nRecovery in the euro area, which began in 2014, failed to gain \nmomentum as growth leveled off toward the end of 2015. Business \nand consumer con\ufb01dence dropped to a 1 year low even as de\ufb02ation \nreappeared, signaling a slow start to 2016. Labor markets have \nimproved, but demand is insufficient to generate in\ufb02ation. The region \nfaces a number of downside risks, both domestic and external, that \ncould derail recovery, thus introducing an element of caution to the \ngrowth outlook. \n\nGDP in the fourth quarter of 2015 grew by a saar of 1.3%, bringing \nannual growth for the year to 1.6%, the highest since 2011 (Figure\u00a0A1.5). \n\n\f32\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nQuarter over quarter, growth in the fourth quarter remained \nat 1.1% in Germany, and France recorded a slight rise\u00a0by\u00a00.1%, \nwhile economic activity slowed by 0.4% in Italy and 0.1% \nin\u00a0Spain.\n\nAn examination of components showed that in the \nlast quarter of 2015 \ufb01xed investment growth contributed \na relatively strong 1.1 percentage points, while private \nconsumption added only 0.5 points. Government \nconsumption also contributed 0.5 points, an improvement \nover the previous quarter that probably re\ufb02ected aid to \nimmigrants. While domestic demand supported growth, net \nexports subtracted 1.2 percentage points from growth, as \nimports outpaced exports. The negative contribution from \nthe external sector during 2 consecutive quarters suggests \nthat the boost from a weaker euro may be fading.\n\nAlthough investment rose, industry remained weak as \nthe production index declined by 0.2% in the last quarter of \n2015, after a minimal rise of 0.1% in the third (Figure\u00a0A1.6). \nThe composite purchasing managers\u2019 index exceeded 50, \nshowing expanded activity, but the decline from 54.3 in \nDecember to 53.6 in January, and to a 13-month low of 53.0 in \nFebruary, did not signal a strong recovery at the start of 2016. \nThe\u00a0European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator \nalso declined during the \ufb01rst 2 months of 2016. \n\nEconomic sentiment declined partly because of lower \nconsumer con\ufb01dence, which fell in February to its lowest \nsince December 2014. It appears that consumption, the main \ndriver of growth in 2015, lost steam toward the end of the \nyear, as re\ufb02ected in average growth of only 0.1% in retail \nsales in the last quarter of 2015. However, a pickup to 0.4% in \nJanuary provided some cause for optimism. Going forward, \ngrowth in private consumption may bene\ufb01t somewhat from \nlow oil prices, easier credit, and falling unemployment. \n\nThe labor market has improved in the euro area, with the \n\nseasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rate declining \nsteadily to 10.3% in January, the lowest since August 2011. \nHowever, the rate remains historically high and masks wide \nvariation in joblessness across countries. Germany, which has \nthe lowest unemployment rate in the region, saw a further \ndrop from 4.4% in December to 4.3% in January. Spain and \nItaly, which have relatively high rates, also recorded declines, \nfrom 20.7% to 20.5% in Spain and from 11.6% to 11.5% \nin\u00a0Italy. France, by contrast, saw an increase from 10.1% to \n10.2% over the month. A\u00a0number of other countries still face \ndouble-digit unemployment rates, including Croatia, Cyprus, \nGreece, Latvia, Portugal, and Slovakia, suggesting that there \nis plenty of excess capacity to restrain in\ufb02ation. \n\nThe threat of de\ufb02ation resurfaced, with the harmonized \n\nindex of consumer prices dipping from 0.3% in January to \n\u20130.2% in February, dragged down partly by low energy prices \n(Figure A1.7).

This has worried the European Central Bank, which has a \ntarget rate of close to 2% for headline in\ufb02ation over the medium term. \nIn March 2016, the bank announced an expansion of its monetary easing \npolicy package. Accordingly, all its main interest rates were cut: the \nre\ufb01nancing rate from 0.05% to zero, the bank deposit rate from \u20130.30% \nto \u20130.40%, and the marginal lending facility rate from 0.30% to 0.25%. \nMonthly purchases under the asset purchase program will be increased \nfrom \u20ac60 billion currently to \u20ac80 billion every month, continuing \nat\u00a0least until March 2017. Other expansionary measures include adding \ninvestment-grade bonds issued by nonbank corporations to the assets \neligible for purchase and launching a new series of targeted re\ufb01nancing \noperations for the longer term.\n\nRecovery in the euro area lacks vigor, and recent survey data \nshow signs of a drop in domestic economic activity at the beginning \nof the\u00a0year. Weak global demand that is further compounded by \nslower growth prospects in emerging economies, particularly the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China (PRC), may continue to constrain the \nexternal sector as well. Other risks to the outlook are global and \nregional \ufb01nancial volatility, \ufb01scal pressures in some countries, the \nuncertain effects of immigration, and geopolitical tensions. A\u00a0cautious \noutlook guides a forecast for moderate growth in 2016 at 1.5% and, \nin\u00a0the\u00a0absence of a strong catalyst, growth edging up to 1.6% in 2017.\n\nJapan \nThe economy grew by only 0.5% in 2015. While this \nimproved zero growth in 2014, Japan still lacked real growth \nmomentum. Relatively strong growth in the \ufb01rst quarter \nwas followed by contraction in the second and fourth. A fall \nin public investment and private consumption contributed \nto the weakness (Figure A1.8). As a result, the economy is \noperating below potential, with the cabinet office estimating \nthe shortfall at the end of 2015 at 1.6% of GDP. Meanwhile, \nthe labor market has tightened, with the unemployment rate \ndeclining by 0.3 percentage points from the start of 2015 to \n3.2% by February 2016, while real wages rose. This probably \nre\ufb02ects a labor shortage as the baby boom generation reaches \nage 65 and retires\u2014a shortage exacerbated by economic \nrecovery since 2013 being driven by labor-intensive sectors \noutside of manufacturing.\n\nWeak private consumption and public investment\u00a0were the \n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221215\n\nmajor drags on growth in 2015.

Overall, the external sector contributed \n0.4\u00a0percentage points to growth in 2015.

Delaying the VAT hike is on the table \ngiven the weakness in the economy, but this baseline assumes the VAT \nincrease as scheduled with some \ufb01scal stimulus. Private consumption \nof durable goods and housing investment are expected to pick up in \n2016 in anticipation of a scheduled VAT hike in April 2017 from 8% to \n10% in 2017 (Figure A1.11). In 2016, external demand is expected to \nimprove but only gradually. GDP is expected to grow by 0.6%.

Consumption remained the principal driver of \ngrowth, contributing 2.2 percentage points, with \ufb01xed capital \nsubtracting 0.6 percentage points, and net exports of goods \nand services contributing almost nothing (Figure A1.12). \nSeasonally adjusted retail sales grew by 0.3% in January 2016, \nbetter than 0.02% growth in December.

While \ufb01xed capital and private \nconsumption also bolstered growth, adding 2.7 and \n1.5\u00a0percentage points respectively, their contribution was \nmore than offset by a decline in inventories (Figure A1.13). \nIn\u00a0the third quarter, seasonally adjusted retail sales rose by \n1.4%, better than the previous quarter\u2019s 0.3%.

Oil prices \nare expected to fall slightly in 2016 but will gradually \nrecover during the year as supply from producers outside the \nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \ndeclines and global demand strengthens. With oil prices \nremaining low and food commodity markets well supplied, \nfood prices should stabilize during the forecast\u00a0period.\n\nOil price movements\nCompared with the decline by more than 50% in the \nprice of the international benchmark Brent crude in the \nsecond\u00a0half\u00a0of 2014\u2014from a peak of $115/barrel on 19 June \nto $56/barrel at the end of the year\u2014the drop in 2015 was \nmore moderate. Brent\u00a0crude\u00a0\ufb01nished 2015 at $36/barrel, \ndown by\u00a036%. The\u00a0average price of oil, however, reveals a \ndifferent story: While a barrel of oil averaged $99/barrel in \n2014, or 9% below the 2013 average, the average price in 2015 \nwas $52/barrel, or 47% below the 2014 average and almost \nhalf the average price in the period 2010\u20132014 (Figure A1.14). \nThe\u00a0last time Brent crude prices stayed in the $40\u2013$50 range \nwas from late 2008 to early 2009. Hopes of a price recovery \nduring 2015 supported a rally from about $40 in the early \nmonths of 2015 to about $60 in April. But\u00a0the rally proved \nshort-lived, and prices remained below $50/barrel in the last \nquarter of the year, languishing in the $30s in December. \n\nLow crude prices in 2015 re\ufb02ected a con\ufb02uence of factors, \n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\nincluding continued abundant supply from non-OPEC \nproducers, unrelenting resolve within OPEC to defend market \nshare, receding concerns over supply disruptions, subdued global growth \nprospects, and the strengthening US dollar.

The US led non-OPEC oil \nproduction. US output of crude oil rose by more than 8% in 2015, with \nthe production of light tight oil contributing the most. Although on a \ndeclining trend since the middle of 2015, light tight oil accounted for more \nthan 40% of growth in non-OPEC supply. \n\nOPEC, on the other hand, maintained its strategy to protect market \nshare and raised crude oil production to 31.3\u00a0mbd.

World oil demand \nincreased by 1.6 mbd in 2015, or 1.7%. Although this was the highest in \n5 years, it was not enough to keep oil prices from falling. Consequently, \nglobal oil inventories increased for the second consecutive year, by about \n2 mbd in 2015, or more than twice the inventory buildup in 2014.\nPrice weakening has persisted in 2016. With the market \noversupplied, market sentiment has played a key role in price \ndetermination. Following failure in OPEC to reach an official decision \nabout oil production on 4\u00a0December 2015, Brent crude oil prices tumbled \nfrom $42/barrel to as low as $26/barrel by the third week of January \n2016. News of OPEC members coordinating output cuts set off a price \nrally, but it was short-lived as the market sensed that a cut in production \nwas unlikely. Lately, oil prices have been rising because of renewed \ntalks in which a larger group of oil producers aim to freeze production, \nas well as because of a continuing decline in the number of active \ndrilling rigs in the US, production outages in Nigeria and Kurdistan, \nand increased demand from the PRC. As of mid-March, Brent crude was \ntrading in the range of $36\u2013$40/barrel.\n\nOil price prospects\nIn its Medium-Term Oil Market Report 2015, the International \nEnergy Agency concluded that oil supply will again exceed \ndemand. However, the agency maintained that the 2015 \nvolume increase, one of the highest in recent history, cannot be \nrepeated in 2016. Low oil prices have prompted oil companies \nto scale back investment and production spending, and to \ndefer exploration, restricting potential growth in oil supply. \nSupply from outside OPEC is forecast to decline by 0.6 mbd \nin 2016 and by 0.02 mbd in 2017. Most of the forecast decline \nis expected to be in the US, which largely re\ufb02ects changes \nin light tight oil production, which is forecast to decline \nby nearly 0.6 mbd in 2016 and 0.2 mbd in 2017. Although \nnon-OPEC supply is forecast to fall, this will be offset by \nhigher production within OPEC, primarily from Iran, Iraq, and \nthe United Arab Emirates. Although production freezes have \nbeen discussed, there has been no sign that OPEC will change \nits current stance, as some key members continue to offer price \ndiscounts to defend market share (Figure A1.16).\n\n$/barrel\n\n2.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u20132.5\n\n\u20135.0\n\nSupply disruptions will still affect oil prices, but oversupply has \nincreased the market\u2019s tolerance for disruption.

In addition, \nweaker prices have spurred improved operating efficiency \nin the US shale oil industry, whose production declines have \nbeen smaller than earlier anticipated. Although a number \nof shale oil producers have scaled down operations, higher \noil prices will encourage them to reenter the market, thereby exerting \ndownward pressure on prices.

The decline in prices came mainly \nfrom favorable supply conditions and low energy prices. \nAll food sub-indexes declined, with edible oils falling \nby\u00a022% and grains by 15% (Figure A1.18). Every component \nof the price index for edible oils and meals declined in \n2015. In\u00a0particular, prices for three key components\u2014\npalm oil, soybean meal, and soybeans\u2014fell by more than \n20%. Large soybean yields and stockpiles of soybean meal \nexerted downward pressure on prices. At the same time, the \ncontinued slump in oil prices depressed demand for palm oil \nand soybeans to make biodiesel fuel. Prices for wheat, maize, \nand rice also declined in 2015, re\ufb02ecting ample supply from \ngood crop yields. After\u00a0rising in 2014, the \u201cother food\u201d index \nfell by 7.5% in 2015.

However, global supplies (stocks \nplus production) of the three major grains remain healthy. \nThe\u00a0latest prospects from the March 2016 report of the US \nDepartment of Agriculture show global supplies of these three \ncrops reaching 2.70 billion tons in the 2015/16 crop year, 0.2% \nhigher than the previous year. Global production of wheat in \n2015/16 is expected to be 0.9% higher, resulting in a 14-year \nhigh in the stock-to-use ratio (Figure\u00a0A1.19). On\u00a0the other \nhand, the market for maize is forecast to be tight, as global \nproduction in 2015/16 is seen declining by 4.0% on account \nof severe drought attributed to El Ni\u00f1o. Despite these cuts in \nproduction, the stock-to-use ratio will rise slightly on lower \nconsumption and higher stock carryover. \n\nAlso affected by El Ni\u00f1o, global rice production is \n\nexpected to fall by 1.6%. Production by major rice exporters \nIndia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Viet Nam is forecast to drop \nby\u00a03.4%, but the stock-to-use ratio will remain close to its \n10-year average at 18.7%. \n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nThe outlook for edible oils remains positive. Production of \n\nthe 10 major edible oils is projected to rise by 1.3%. Supplies \nare expected to remain high because of elevated stock \ncarryover, especially for soybeans, for which production \nincreased by almost 30% from 2013/14.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nRecent weather forecasts suggest that the current El Ni\u00f1o \ncould be one of the strongest on record. However, it is unlikely \nto cause a spike in global agricultural prices because supplies \nof major agricultural commodities are ample and energy \nprices low. Current and past periods of El Ni\u00f1o show the weak \nlink between El Ni\u00f1o episodes and global food prices, during \nwhich food price indexes either declined or changed very little \n(Figure\u00a0A1.20). Regarding La Ni\u00f1a, a weather disruption that \ncan follow El\u00a0Ni\u00f1o, the March report of the Agricultural Market \nInformation System of the Food and Agriculture Organization \nputs the probability of experiencing La Ni\u00f1a in the latter part of \n2016 at 50%. In\u00a0view of well-supplied markets for most grains, \noilseeds, and edible oils, the food commodity price index is expected to \ndecline a further 1% in 2016 before rebounding by 1% in 2017.\n\n\u201320\n\nExternal environment in sum\nThe much-anticipated improvement in the global outlook has yet to \nmaterialize. In particular, despite some promising signs from the US, \ngrowth in the industrial economies will remain \ufb02at. As such, they \ncannot provide a \ufb01llip for developing Asia\u2019s exports and growth. The US \nFederal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates further, but the cautious \nand gradual nature of the hikes will cushion the adverse effect on the \nregion\u2019s \ufb01nancial stability. Subdued oil prices will contain in\ufb02ationary \npressures but are unlikely to boost growth, as they partly re\ufb02ect weak \nglobal demand. In sum, developing Asia must navigate a challenging and \nuncertain external environment, looking to itself to reignite growth.\n\n\f\f2\n\nASIA\u2019S POTENTIAL \ngrOwTh\n\n\f\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\n\nMany Asian economies have registered remarkably high output growth \nrates in the past 3 decades. This achievement came about despite \ndisruptions caused by economic crises. Arguably, the most serious \ndownturn was the Asian \ufb01nancial crisis of 1997\u20131998, which severely \naffected Southeast Asia and the Republic of Korea. By comparison, \nthe global \ufb01nancial crisis (GFC) of 2008\u20132009 has had much less \nimpact on Asia. The main reason why the region\u2019s economies were not \ndirectly affected was their low exposure to United States (US) subprime \nmortgages. The region was nevertheless affected indirectly as demand \nfor its exports from its main trading partners contracted signi\ufb01cantly.\n\nThis was enough to disrupt growth momentum in\u00a0Asia, and \n\nas\u00a0a\u00a0result economic growth in Asia slowed in the\u00a0aftermath \nof the GFC. From an average of 8.3% during 2006\u20132010, \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth in the region fell to \n5.9% in 2015 (Figure 2.1.1). This downward trend in regional \ngrowth follows 6 years of accelerating growth in the\u00a0interval \n2001\u20132007. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), which \naccounts for a large share of the region\u2019s GDP, has been the \nmain driver of regional economic growth. Given the recent \nslowdown in the PRC, some observers have started talking \nabout a \u201cnew normal\u201d of substantially lower growth in \nthe\u00a0region.\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n1.6\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n0\n\nWhile developing Asia is not alone in this regard\u2014growth \nalso declined in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe\u2014\nits slowdown is likely to have repercussions for the region \nand the rest of the world. Developing Asia\u2019s success in lifting \n1\u00a0billion individuals out of poverty during 1990\u20132012 hinged on \nits ability to sustain high rates of economic growth. Moreover, \nas the region currently accounts for more than a quarter of \nworld GDP as valued at market exchange rates, a\u00a0persistent slowdown in \ndeveloping Asia threatens to undermine the fragile global recovery. \n\n1995\n\n\u22124\n\nThis theme chapter aims to reveal the factors underlying the growth \n\nslowdown and the extent to which the slowdown re\ufb02ects changes in \nthe region\u2019s productive capacity.

The right \npolicy response depends on the nature of the region\u2019s slowdown. Is it a \ntemporary\u2014albeit prolonged\u2014effect of the business cycle? Or are more \npersistent changes under way? If weaker growth re\ufb02ects slack demand \nsuch as softening export orders or a downturn in private investment, \nthen \ufb01scal or monetary stimulus may be needed for temporary support. \nBut if supply-side factors are at play, and growth moderation stems from \nslowing expansion of the region\u2019s productive capacity, then any revival \nof growth prospects may depend on structural policy reform. \n\nThe concepts of potential GDP and potential growth, which \nare grounded in a view of an economy\u2019s productive capacity under \nconditions of stable in\ufb02ation and full employment, can be used to \ndistinguish temporary deviations from the underlying trend in actual \nGDP growth. This chapter provides the theoretical foundation for \npotential growth, develops a simple framework to estimate it from \nreadily available macroeconomic indicators, and applies the framework \nto a sample of developing economies in Asia. \n\nConceptualizing potential growth\nStandard economic theory assumes that transitory shocks to the actual \ngrowth rate do not signi\ufb01cantly affect the dynamics of the underlying \ntrend or the potential growth rate. Several studies have recently \nchallenged this view, however, and have proposed arguments and \nprovided empirical evidence that support the hypothesis that there \nis a signi\ufb01cant relationship between the short-run cyclical behavior \nof economic growth and long-term performance (e.g., Stiglitz 1993, \nCerra and Saxena 2008). This suggests that the GFC may indeed have \na signi\ufb01cant impact on the future growth trajectory of individual \neconomies.\n\nThe possibility of a permanent downward shift affects prospects \nfor sustained increases in output. This is an important medium-term \nconcern for policy makers, particularly in less developed countries \nwhere intense pressure exists to deliver sustained increases in living \nstandards. Rodrik (2009), for example, argued that the world after the \n2008\u20132009 crisis would be signi\ufb01cantly different from its pre-crisis \nincarnation, in particular as a milieu for East Asian economies \nthriving as they did in the 20th century. This is because the crisis has \npermanently reduced growth in both productivity and the labor force.1 \nLikewise, Pritchett and Summers (2014) argued that the days of fast \ngrowth in Asia might be numbered because regression to the mean is \nempirically the most robust feature of economic growth. The statistical \nanalysis showed that rapid growth episodes in developing countries are \n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200245\n\nfrequently followed by signi\ufb01cant slowdowns. Moreover, the historical \ndistribution of growth has an average of 2% with a standard deviation \nthat is also 2%.\n\nOne approach to addressing the main issues is to examine the supply \n\nside of the economy through the concept of potential or natural output \ngrowth. The notion of potential output was initially formulated to \nquantify the ability of an economy to produce output, i.e., its productive \ncapacity. \u201cPotential output\u201d is therefore the highest level of real GDP \nthat can be attained over the long term. By translating levels to growth \nrates, one obtains the rate of growth of potential output. A limit to \noutput growth exists because of technical, natural, and institutional \nconstraints on the ability to produce. \n\nGrowth theory indicates that in the long run economies tend to grow \n\nat a rate consistent with the full utilization of productive resources, \ni.e., the natural or potential growth rate. Short-term shocks can induce \ntemporary deviations from potential growth rate, which give rise to \nchanges in unemployment and in\ufb02ation, but over time these changes \nare corrected by price adjustments and growth returns to its potential. \nWhat this means is that the high growth rates enjoyed by Asian \neconomies re\ufb02ected their high potential growth rates. Nevertheless, \nthe\u00a0precise meaning of this term has evolved over time (Box 2.1.1).\n\nThe approach followed in this chapter is consistent with Harrod\u2019s \n\nde\ufb01nition of potential growth\u2014the sum of the growth rates of labor \nproductivity and of the labor force\u2014and with Okun\u2019s concept of \npotential output (Harrod 1939, Okun 1962). Hence, potential output \ngrowth is de\ufb01ned as the maximum rate of growth that an economy can \nachieve consistent with macroeconomic stability, in which there are \nneither in\ufb02ationary nor de\ufb02ationary pressures.\n\nThere is broad agreement that Asia\u2019s spectacular growth in \nrecent decades was enabled by its rapid structural transformation, \ni.e., its\u00a0capacity to shift resources out of agriculture into sectors of \nhigher productivity (ADB 2013). The speed of an economy\u2019s structural \ntransformation depends largely on institutional barriers that affect, \namong other things, the reallocation of factors of production, e.g., \nrestrictive labor laws. Given that these barriers are pervasive in many \nAsian countries and that agriculture is still a large employer (employing \n50% of all workers in India and about 30% in the PRC), Asia\u2019s prospects \nto reengineer high growth will depend largely on eliminating these \nbarriers. Arguably, a signi\ufb01cant share of the high growth registered \nby the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China from the mid-1960s to \nthe mid-1990s, and in the PRC after 1980, is accounted for by the \nweakening of these barriers, which facilitated the absorption of labor \nby the manufacturing and service sectors. But\u00a0most Asian economies \nstill have signi\ufb01cant barriers that prevent the development of modern \nmanufacturing and services. Moreover, there are important obstacles \nthat make it difficult to efficiently reallocate factors across\u00a0\ufb01rms.\n\nThis leads to the important point that potential growth consistent \n\nwith stable in\ufb02ation as used in this chapter is\u00a0conditional\u00a0on the \neconomy\u2019s institutions and economic structure. Suppose that one \ncould measure additional growth over and above this potential growth \nthat could be achieved with the removal of all institutional barriers \n\n\f46\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\n2.1.1\u2002Evolving notions of potential output growth\n\nThe idea of potential output has evolved historically. \nThere\u00a0are four main stages in the progression. \n\nFirst stage. When Harrod (1939) discussed the \n\n\u201cnatural growth rate,\u201d this was probably the first formal \nreference in the literature to the idea of an economy\u2019s full-\nemployment growth rate. Harrod defined an economy\u2019s \nnatural growth rate ((cid:30)\u02c6gN(cid:30)) as the sum of the growth rates \nof labor productivity ((cid:30)\u02c6yN(cid:30)) and of the labor force ((cid:30)\u02c6nN(cid:30)), i.e., \n\u02c6gN\u00a0=\u00a0\u02c6yN\u00a0+\u00a0\u02c6nN. It represents the maximum sustainable rate \nof growth that technical conditions make available to the \neconomic system. At any particular time, actual growth can \ndiverge from the natural growth rate because of various \nrestrictions, rigidities, and constraints, as well as the effect \nof positive and negative transitory shocks. Nonetheless, \nactual growth cannot persistently exceed \u02c6gN as this would \neventually create inflationary pressures, including an \nexcessively tight labor market. With wages rising relative to \nthe price of capital, the economy would adopt more capital-\nintensive techniques, unemployment would rise again to a \ncomfortable approximation of full employment, and growth \nwould converge on the natural rate. On the other hand, \nif actual growth were consistently lower than the natural \ngrowth rate, the resulting rise in unemployment would \ntrigger the opposite price adjustment process, and falling \nwages would in due course restore higher employment \nthrough the adoption of more labor-intensive production \ntechniques until equilibrium in the labor market was \nachieved, and actual and natural growth rates were brought \ninto line.\n\nSecond stage. It was not until the 1960s that these \nideas gave rise to an active body of empirical work around \nthe idea of potential output. Since then, there have been \nessentially two concepts of potential output in the literature. \nThe first is based on Okun (1962), and the second on \nFriedman (1968). Okun was interested in the question how \nmuch output the economy could produce under conditions \nof full employment and answered it by introducing the \nconcept of potential gross national product. Okun\u2019s work \nharked back to Harrod but also accommodated Keynes \nand the Phillips curve. He argued that potential output \nis a supply concept of the level of output under the full \nutilization of factor inputs. However, Okun stressed that the \nsocial target of maximum production and employment is \nconstrained by a social desire for price stability. This did not \nimply, however, that inflation had to be stabilized at a low \nrate. Okun\u2019s aim was to specify the appropriate fiscal policy \n\nto maximize employment subject to the constraint that \ninflation should not be excessive. The implied relationship\u2014\nreferred to as Okun\u2019s Law\u2014had practical policy implications \nunder conditions of a stable trade-off between inflation \nand unemployment (the Phillips curve) and the direct \nresponsiveness of employment to demand (as explored by \nKeynes).\n\nThird stage. Okun was seriously questioned in the \n1970s. The reason was not his concept of potential output. \nRather, the rise of inflation during that decade caused \ndisappointment with full employment policies. Friedman \n(1968) and Phelps (1967) questioned the stability of the \ninflation\u2013unemployment trade-off embodied in the Phillips \ncurve. They argued that the rate of wage increases was \nstable at only one rate of unemployment, which was termed \nits \u201cnatural rate\u201d or the \u201cnonaccelerating inflation rate of \nunemployment.\u201d If unemployment were beneath this natural \nrate, expectations of rising wages would cause inflation to \naccelerate without limit. The Friedman\u2013Phelps critique \nof the Phillips curve had clear significance for the labor \nmarket and cast doubt on the feasibility of full employment, \nwhich was the touchstone of Okun\u2019s work.\n\nFourth stage. The result was a radical shift in thinking \n\nin the 1980s and 1990s about the relationship between \ndemand pressure and inflation. The outcome was Okun\u2019s \nconcept of the output gap being superseded by variants \nof Friedman\u2019s natural rate hypothesis. The central bank \nreaction function presented in Taylor (1993), for example, \nbecame a rule observed by many central banks when \nsetting interest rates. This work led by the end of the \n1990s and early 2000s to the so-called New Consensus \nMacroeconomics, also referred to as the New Keynesian \nPerspective. Essentially, this is a three-equation model \nconsisting of (i) the relationship between interest rates and \nthe output gap, (ii) the Phillips curve relationship between \ninflation and the output gap, and (iii) the so-called Taylor \nRule, which sets interest rates according to the output gap \nand the difference between actual and targeted inflation. \nIn these models, prices or real wages adjust toward their \nlong-run equilibrium values but do so slowly, with the \nresult that actual output may deviate from the short-term \nmeasure of potential output. Consequently, the output gap \nmeasures the deviation of actual from potential output \nthat arises as a result of rigidities in prices and wages that \nprevent them from responding freely to changes in demand \nand supply. \n\nand distortions in the economy: market imperfections, collusion, \nrent-seeking, externalities, and government policies that obstruct the \nmobility of factors, both capital and labor. This would then be the \ntrue maximum rate at which the economy can grow. This concept is \nreferred to as the economy\u2019s frontier potential growth. It cannot be \nquanti\ufb01ed, but the idea is clear and useful for developing economies. \n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200247\n\n2.1.2\u2002Sample economies \n\nAzerbaijan\nBangladesh\nCambodia\nPeople\u2019s Republic  \n\u00acof China\nFiji\nHong Kong, China\nIndia\nIndonesia\nKazakhstan\nRepublic of Korea\nMalaysia\n\nPakistan\nPapua New Guinea\nPhilippines\nSingapore\nSri Lanka\nTaipei,China\nTajikistan\nThailand\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\nViet Nam\n\nWhile the difference between potential growth and frontier potential \ngrowth\u00a0is not\u00a0large in advanced economies, the distinction is important \nfor economies riddled with inefficiencies.\u00a0Policies and reforms that \nease some of these constraints in the latter group can have salutary \neffects on potential growth, especially if it languishes far from the \nfrontier.\u00a0Understanding\u00a0these constraints can help policy makers propel \ntheir economies closer to their true limit.\n\nEstimating potential growth\nPotential output is not directly observed. As such, the \ufb01rst \nstep in analyzing developing Asia\u2019s potential is to develop an \nempirical model. This section develops a simple empirical \nmodel and applies it to a sample of 22 developing economies \nin Asia (Box 2.1.2). While limited data availability constrained \nselection for the sample, the group includes the three \nlargest economies\u2014the PRC, India, and Indonesia\u2014and \nrepresentatives of all subregions in developing Asia. As the \nsample accounts for more than 98% of GDP in the region \nin\u00a02014, the aggregate results should broadly represent the \nregion\u2019s experience.\n\nAt present, most economists view economic growth as \nthe sum of a cyclical component and a permanent component. \nThe former captures the business cycle or demand \n\ufb02uctuations and the latter the long-run trajectory of growth. \nThis is the \u201cnatural\u201d or potential growth rate of the economy, consistent \nwith the full utilization of productive resources\u2014in particular full \nemployment of the labor force accompanied by stable in\ufb02ation. There \nare various methods to estimate the potential growth rate, which are \nsummarized in Box 2.1.3.\n\nFrom the methods listed in the box, this chapter uses a multivariate \nestimate that relies on information on GDP growth and in\ufb02ation. This is \nobviously an improvement over the univariate \ufb01lters. Unlike the growth \naccounting approach, it does not require a series of capital stock, which \nis lacking in most Asian economies. And, unlike the output identity \napproach, the method employed in this chapter provides an explicit link \nwith concepts of macroeconomic stability. Before the model is estimated, \nunivariate \ufb01lters are applied to the data series to extract the underlying \ntrends of each variable.\n\nAs noted above, deviations of actual growth from the potential rate \n\ncause resources to be either overutilized or underutilized, giving rise \nto changes in the unemployment rate and, consequently, to in\ufb02ationary \nor de\ufb02ationary pressures. Consequently, potential output growth \nis associated with a stable in\ufb02ation environment. The framework \nused in this chapter to estimate the potential growth rate of the \nAsian\u00a0economies builds on this intuition. \n\nPotential growth as modeled in this chapter is consistent with \nthe Harrod (1939) concept of the natural rate of growth. The natural \nrate of growth is described as both the potential growth rate toward \nwhich the economy tends in the long-run and the short-term upward \nlimit to growth, which turns cyclical expansions into recessions. \n\n\f48\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\n2.1.3\u2002Methods to estimate potential growth\n\nPotential growth, unlike actual growth, is not directly \nobservable and hence has to be estimated. Some of the most \nwidely used methods are as follows:\n\nUnivariate filters. These are statistical procedures that \nare not based on any underlying economic theory and use \ninformation only on GDP. Their objective is to statistically \nremove the cyclical component of a series from the raw \ndata. The most widely used is the Hodrick\u2013Prescott, \nbut some other filters are the Baxter\u2013King, Christiano\u2013\nFitzgerald, Beveridge\u2013Nelson, and Corbae\u2013Ouliaris. \nMultivariate estimates. These approaches use \ninformation from several economic series to obtain \nestimates of potential output. The models are typically \nbased on a structural theory. For example, they estimate the \nrate of economic growth consistent with \u201cmacroeconomic \nstability.\u201d One simple model is a bivariate structural time \nseries linking temporary fluctuations in output to inflation, \nand postulating that the output gap is positively related \nto inflation pressures. An extended version could add an \nOkun\u2019s Law equation relating unemployment and output \ngrowth.\n\nGrowth accounting approach. This is also a multivariate \n\napproach in that it uses information on variables related \nthrough an aggregate production function: output, \nemployment, capital, and residually measured total factor \nproductivity. Typically, authors derive a decomposition of \nthe sources of growth using a Cobb\u2013Douglas production \n\u03b1\u2212\n)\n. In most cases it \nfunction such as \n(\nis not estimated econometrically; rather, factor markets \nare assumed to be competitive, so the labor and capital \nelasticities equal the factor shares in national income, and \nthese are imposed to derive total factor productivity growth. \nOutput identity. This approach decomposes output (Y) \n\nY A K L H\u03b1\nt\nt\nt\n\n(1\n)\n\n=\n\nt\n\nt\n\nmultiplicatively as the product of a series of terms, e.g., \nlabor productivity in hours (Y/H), hours per employee \n(H/L), the employment rate (L/P), and working-age \n\uf028\npopulation (P), such that \nY\n\uf03d\nseries can also be filtered to calculate their trend, which is \nthen interpreted as the potential level. Like the production \nfunction approach, this method does not explicitly link the \nestimation of trend growth to the estimation of the output \ngap and inflation.\n\n. These \n\nP\n\nH\nL\n\nY\nH\n\n\uf029\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\n\uf029\n\n\uf028\n\nL\nP\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSince\u00a0by\u00a0de\ufb01nition it is the sum of the growth rates of labor productivity \nand the labor force, potential growth can be usefully decomposed into \nthese two elements once it is estimated. Note that when actual growth is \nequal to potential, employment grows at the same rate as the labor force, \nkeeping the unemployment rate constant. As such, when actual growth \nis consistently slower than the natural rate, unemployment will rise, \nand\u00a0vice versa. \n\nAs a consequence, a convenient method to estimate the natural \ngrowth rate relies on the relationship between unemployment and \noutput growth formalized in Okun\u2019s Law (e.g., Le\u00f3n-Ledesma and \nThirlwall 2002). Such a choice is complicated, however, by the lack \nor unreliability of labor market data for many Asian economies. This \nproblem is addressed by noting that a natural extension of the concept \nof the natural growth rate is the link with the relationship between \nunemployment and in\ufb02ation typi\ufb01ed in the Phillips curve. The process, \nas described in Box 2.1.4, is to estimate the relationship of the gap \nbetween actual and expected in\ufb02ation to the gap between actual growth \nand its natural rate. The model that relates output growth and in\ufb02ation \ngenerates annual estimates of the potential growth rate.\n\nPotential growth trends in developing Asia\nWhen applied to developing economies with signi\ufb01cant surplus \nlabor, the model suggests that they can grow fast until the surplus is \neliminated. Economies with surplus labor have relatively high labor \nforce growth rates, many unemployed and underemployed workers, \nand low wages. Under these circumstances, there is room to grow \n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200249\n\n2.1.4\u2002Multivariate estimates of potential growth\n\nThe model used for estimation has three underlying pillars: \n(i) Harrod\u2019s notion of the natural growth rate, (ii) Okun\u2019s \nLaw relating unemployment to output, and (iii) the Phillips\u2019 \ncurve relating inflation to output.\n\nSince the natural growth rate is defined as the sum of \nthe growth rates of labor productivity and the labor force, \nunemployment will rise whenever the actual rate of growth \n(\u02c6gt(cid:30)) falls below the natural rate \n\u02c6gt rises above  \u02c6 N\nOkun\u2019s Law:\n\n)N\n, and it will fall when \ntg .

This \nspecification and its variants have been widely used in the \nliterature to estimate  \u02c6 N\ntg  for countries and regions and also \nto investigate its possible endogeneity (e.g., Le\u00f3n-Ledesma \nand Thirlwall 2002, Lanzafame 2010). The specification in \nequation (1) presents two issues that are addressed in this \nchapter. First, the model produces only a single estimate \nof the potential growth rate for the time period under \nanalysis. Since its evolution over time is what is important, \na time-varying parameter approach is applied to estimate \na time\u00a0series for  \u02c6 N\ntg . Second, the unemployment rate and, \nmore generally, labor market data are notoriously unreliable \nfor some of the economies in the sample. \n\nTo deal with this data problem, Harrod\u2019s definition of \n\u02c6 N\ntg  is linked to the relationship between unemployment and \ngrowth. The potential growth rates of the Asian economies \nare then estimated based on an aggregate supply model. \nIn the long run, unemployment will be constant when it is \nequal to the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment \n(NAIRU). Therefore, the potential growth rate can be \ndefined as that growth rate consistent with \n, which \nimplies \u2206Ut = 0.

This implies that an economy\u2019s potential growth rate could be \nhigher if such bottlenecks were eased or eliminated.\n\nMeanwhile, in the case of the Central Asian economies, their \ndependence on natural resources can affect the estimates through the \neffect of commodity price shocks on domestic in\ufb02ation.

Meanwhile, in the sample of Asian economies, \nresults show that, where inflation rates are below 45%, \nfor\u00a0each percentage point of actual growth in excess of the \nnatural growth rate, the inflation rate increases by about \n0.2\u00a0percentage points.\n\ndifficult to state a priori the sign of this relation, which possibly should \nbe stronger in more open economies. This can be controlled for, if \nonly indirectly, by including in the model the share of imports in GDP \n(Romer 1993). The problem is the lack of sufficiently long time series, \nwith the consequence that meaningful results are difficult to obtain. \nThe\u00a0model being estimated is therefore based on certain assumptions \nthat may not exactly \ufb01t oil-dependent economies. Box 2.1.5 discusses \nhow well the model performs with the given sample.\n\nGraphs of estimated potential growth rates and actual growth rates \n\nare presented in Figure 2.1.2. These are for 12 of the 22 developing \neconomies in Asia under consideration.2\n\nThese graphs show that the potential growth rate was more stable \n\nthan actual growth, and that it was fairly high and/or increasing \nin the 1980s and 1990s in most economies. The pattern aligns with \nexpectations. The graphs also suggest that, in most cases, the \nestimated potential growth rate was higher in 2000 than in 2014. \nMoreover, the trend was either stable or declining during 2008\u20132014. \nFigure\u00a02.1.3\u00a0shows the difference between the period average rates for \npotential growth and actual growth between 2000\u20132007 (pre-crisis) \nand 2008\u20132014 (post-crisis).\n\nIt is worth noting that during 2008\u20132014, potential growth declined \nin Asia\u2019s advanced economies as well as in some of the major economies, \nincluding the PRC and the Republic of Korea. Thailand suffered a \nsigni\ufb01cant decline in its potential growth rate, which is the lowest in \nSoutheast Asia.

From 2008, a gradual decline \nin potential growth is observed to be about 7.9% in 2014, \njust slightly above actual growth at 7.4%.

During 2008\u20132014, in\ufb02ation slowed \nas the deviation of actual growth from potential growth was \nonly slightly negative. This is consistent with the theoretical \nframework underlying the model, which states that a decline \nin the in\ufb02ation rate is associated with the actual growth rate \nbeing below potential.4\n\nIndia. For most of the estimation period, India\u2019s potential \ngrowth rate was quite stable.5 A substantial increase starting \nin the early 2000s is observed, with potential growth peaking \nin 2007 at 8.6%. As with the PRC, potential growth declined \nin the aftermath of the GFC, falling to 6.3% in 2014. However, \nthe average in 2008\u20132014 was only 0.06 percentage points \nlower than in 2000\u20132007. The average deviation of actual \nfrom potential growth was slightly negative.

It experienced a \nsigni\ufb01cant decline during the Asian \ufb01nancial\u00a0crisis of 1997\u2013\n1998, after which it recovered slightly.

The \n2008\u20132014 averages of actual and potential growth were also \nvery close to each other, the deviation being slightly negative. \nThis is consistent with a slightly declining in\ufb02ation rate. \nIn 2014, the Republic of Korea\u2019s potential growth rate was \nestimated at 3.3%, very close to actual growth.\n\nIndonesia.

A comparison of Asia-13 and \nAsia-12 averages allows the assessment of the in\ufb02uence of \nthe PRC on the potential growth performance of the region \nas\u00a0a\u00a0whole.\n\nIn the case of Asia-4, potential growth declined \nfrom an average of about 9% in 1988 to just over 3% in \n2014. The\u00a0aggregate behavior of Asia-13 provides a more \ncomplex and nuanced view of Asia\u2019s potential growth. \nFirst,\u00a0potential\u00a0growth increased prior to the Asian \ufb01nancial \ncrisis of 1997\u20131998. The series peaked at a range of 7.3%\u20137.4% \nin 1994\u20131996. Potential growth declined during the crisis \nand bottomed out in 1998 at 5.36%. It then recovered and \nincreased from 1999 to 2007, peaking at 8.45%. After the \nGFC in 2008, potential growth started declining, falling to \n6.7% in 2014, almost 2 percentage points below the peak. \nThe\u00a0signi\ufb01cant decline from the peak indicates that the \nregion may have entered a new normal of lower potential \ngrowth, an issue that will be explored further in the third \nsection of this theme chapter.\n\nIt is also important to note that developing Asia\u2019s \ndynamics of potential growth are increasingly determined \nby the growth performance of the PRC. The PRC share in \nregional GDP increased to almost 55% in 2014 from only \n25% in 1988. In this context, the surge in regional potential \ngrowth between 1998 and 2007 was mostly the result of the \nphenomenal growth performance by the PRC (Figure\u00a02.1.5). \nThe consequence was that the PRC contributed about three-\nquarters of the overall rise in potential output growth during \nthis period. Speci\ufb01cally, the PRC contributed 2.31 percentage \npoints out of the total increase of 3.09 percentage points. \nOf\u00a0that 2.31 percentage points, 1.09 is derived from its rising \npotential growth rate, and 1.22 can be attributed to the \ngrowing PRC share in developing Asia\u2019s GDP. Most of the \nremaining increase in potential growth was contributed by \nIndia and the Republic of Korea, while several economies \nmade negative contributions to the regional average.\n\nIn the same vein, the decline from the onset of the GFC \n\nto 2014 was determined primarily by events in the PRC, \nIndia, and the Republic of Korea. However, the latter two \neconomies played a bigger role in this episode.

As with Asia-13, the decline during \n2008\u20132014 was signi\ufb01cant. The substantial decline in Asia-12 average \npotential growth with respect to the earlier part of the 1990s is also \nnoted. Another common feature is that Asia-12 average potential growth \nduring the Asian \ufb01nancial crisis was lower than during the GFC. With \nor without the PRC, the behavior of potential growth clearly shows a \nturning point after the GFC. \n\nThe question remains whether this slowdown in potential growth \nis a new normal for the region\u2014and what, if anything, policy makers \ncan do to counteract this trend. Future gains in living standards and \npoverty elimination rest on a grasp of potential growth. Identifying \nthe institutional and policy constraints that keep an economy from \nachieving its frontier potential growth will be critical to counteract the \ncurrent slowdown. Knowing which factors have driven potential growth \nin the past can guide policy makers\u2019 efforts to meet today\u2019s growth \nchallenge.\n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200255\n\nDeterminants of potential\u00a0growth\n\nSeveral approaches are used to tease out what is behind the recent \nslowdown in potential growth. First, the time-series estimates of \npotential growth for the 22 developing economies in Asia can be \ndecomposed using a set of simple techniques that stem from the \nde\ufb01nitions of the key concepts. From the Harrod (1939) concept of \nthe natural growth rate, potential growth is the sum of labor force \ngrowth and potential labor productivity growth\u2014that is, growth in \npotential output per worker. Potential labor productivity growth itself \ncan be decomposed to show it driven by such factors as within-sector \nproductivity growth, the effect of employment reallocation across \nsectors, capital accumulation, and total factor productivity growth. \nSecond, an econometric model is estimated using cross-country \ndata for a larger sample of countries including those outside of Asia \nto establish the determinants of potential growth. The objective is to \nobtain robust and reliable estimates of variables signi\ufb01cantly correlated \nwith the potential growth rate. \n\nFinally, \ufb01rm-level data are used to study the role of institutional \nobstacles in generating distortions that cause resource misallocation. \nThis exercise can help shed light on policies that could help shift an \neconomy closer to its frontier potential growth.\n\nPotential labor productivity growth\nFollowing Harrod\u2019s de\ufb01nition of the natural growth rate, potential labor \nproductivity growth is potential growth less the growth rate of the \nlabor force. Because labor market data in many developing economies \nin Asia are unreliable, working-age population, which is the population \naged 15\u201364, is used as a proxy for the labor force. These data are \ufb01ltered \nusing appropriate statistical techniques to purge short-term variability, \nwhich is caused largely by transitory migration \ufb02ows.\n\nFigure 2.2.1 shows both potential and actual labor productivity \ngrowth rates for the 12 Asian economies whose potential growth was \ngraphed in the previous section. The PRC displays a high potential \nlabor productivity growth rate\u2014signi\ufb01cantly higher than that of India. \nThis explains a large part of the difference in potential output growth \nbetween these two economies. Consistent with their transition into \nhigh-income economies, the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China show \nmarked declines in potential labor productivity growth. This\u00a0is less \nobvious in Singapore. Actual and potential labor productivity growth \ntend to track each other quite closely in most economies. However, the \nPhilippines is a notable exception, with actual labor productivity growth \nlagging potential for most of the period. \n\nFigure 2.2.2 reports the breakdown of potential output growth into \n\npotential labor productivity growth and \ufb01ltered labor force growth \nfor the periods 2000\u20132007 and 2008\u20132013.

There is a decline in most \neconomies. The \ufb01gure also shows in each bar the change in \nthe two components. In the PRC, potential output growth \ndeclined by about 1 percentage point between the two \nsubperiods. Most of the decline is accounted for by the \nslowing of working-age population growth, with potential \nlabor productivity growth actually increasing slightly. On\u00a0the \nother hand, India saw a very small increase in potential \noutput growth between the two periods. This was accounted \nfor by the increase in potential labor productivity growth, \nwhich was slightly larger than the decline in working-age \npopulation growth. In the Republic of Korea, most of the \ndecline in potential growth is accounted for by the decline in \npotential labor productivity growth. And, in Indonesia, most \nof the increase in potential output growth was accounted for \nby the increase in potential labor productivity growth.\n\nDecomposition of potential labor \nproductivity\u00a0growth\nUsing shift-share analysis, the estimates of labor productivity \ngrowth are decomposed into productivity growth within the \nsector, changes in the employment structure, slack in the \neconomy, capital deepening, and total factor productivity \ngrowth (Foster-McGregor and Verspagen 2016). This provides \na simple but very useful way to assess which component \nof potential labor productivity growth is the largest and \nmatters the most in explaining labor productivity growth. \nBox\u00a02.2.1\u00a0shows how these decompositions are interpreted.\nEquation (3) in Box 2.2.1 shows that potential labor \nproductivity growth can be decomposed into the sum of \nthe within, static, and dynamic effects, plus two terms that \ncapture an output gap and a labor gap.

(2014) \ndocumented that the share of agricultural employment in the \nRepublic of Korea recorded a 1.23 percentage point decline per \nannum during 1962\u20132013, falling from 69% to 6%. Meanwhile, \nthe corresponding decline for the PRC was 1\u00a0percentage point \nper annum, from a share of 82% to 31%, and\u00a0for Taipei,China \n0.88 points, from a share of 50% to 5%. These are among \nthe fastest declines in history, even faster than the declines \nexperienced by the advanced economies in the 19th and \n20th centuries. Meanwhile, India, Pakistan, and many other \neconomies still have very high agricultural employment \nshares, which are declining very slowly.\n\nFigure 2.2.6 shows the employment structure of typical \nlow-, middle-, and high-income country. Probably, the most \nsalient feature is the different shares of agriculture: 39% of \ntotal employment in low-income economies, 17% in middle-\nincome economies, and 2% in high-income economies. \nThe\u00a0\ufb02ip\u00a0side of this is the share of services.\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\nStructural transformation has been much faster in \nsome Asian economies than in others. Differential paces \nof economic growth can, by themselves, generate different speeds \nof structural change that re\ufb02ect the relative productivity growth of \ndifferent sectors, or changes in the composition of demand (Herrendorf, \nRogerson, and Valentinyi 2014). Impediments to the reallocation of \nfactors of production are also important. These\u00a0can be related to \ngovernment failure or market failure caused by coordination problems \nand underdeveloped \ufb01nancial markets (Sen 2016). \n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n%\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nZ\nA\nK\n\nK\nA\nP\n\nI\n\nH\nP\n\nA\nH\nT\n\nI\nR\nS\n\nG\nK\nH\n\nN\nI\nS\n\nE\nZ\nA\n\nN\nA\nB\n\nO\nN\n\nI\n\nL\nA\nM\n\nR\nO\nK\n\nP\nA\nT\n\nD\nN\n\nI\n\nE\nI\nV\n\nC\nR\nP\n\nAZE = Azerbaijan, BAN = Bangladesh, HKG = Hong Kong, China, \nIND\u00a0=\u00a0India, INO = Indonesia, KAZ = Kazakhstan, KOR = Republic of Korea, \nMAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia, PAK = Pakistan, PHI = Philippines, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, SIN = Singapore, SRI = Sri Lanka, TAP = Taipei,China, THA = Thailand, \nVIE\u00a0=\u00a0Viet Nam.\nNote: For Kazakhstan, 1999\u20132008.

First, land reform \nand land-use policies affect the reallocation of labor resources from \nlow- to high-productivity sectors, albeit indirectly. Widespread \nland reform through the fair redistribution of agricultural land \ncan boost agricultural productivity and provide surplus labor that \nmay be reallocated to industry. Agrarian reform can also effect \nincome redistribution that encourages the formation of human \ncapital and increase aggregate demand. The Republic of Korea and \nTaipei,China successfully implemented widespread land reform prior to \nindustrialization, allowing their economies to undergo rapid structural \ntransformation from the 1970s to the 1990s. Other economies in Asia \nattempted to implement land reform but with few tangible results. \nSecond, labor policies that are geared toward protecting labor \nwelfare impose rigidities in nominal wages and introduce barriers to \nlabor reallocation. These regulations provide incentive to substitute \ncapital for labor and can slow down the pace of investment. As such, \nlabor market regulations potentially impede structural transformation \nwhen they are overly rigid. One problem partly responsible for India\u2019s \nslow pace of structural transformation is its rigid labor market as \nstipulated in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.\n\nA third government failure is migration policy that restricts worker \nmobility. Limiting the mobility of labor directly affects the availability \nof this resource and can create geographic imbalance between the \navailability of quali\ufb01ed workers and demand for them. An example of \na restrictive migration policy is the hukou system of residency permits \nin the PRC, which constrains the free \ufb02ow of labor between urban and \nrural areas and consequently slows the pace of structural transformation.\n\nLastly, governments inadvertently raise the cost of business by \n\nimposing product and market regulations. These slow structural \ntransformation through their negative effects on investment and, \nconsequently, \ufb01rms\u2019 scale of operations. While governments often \n\n\fimpose labor market and product market regulations to mitigate market \nfailures, the failure of regulatory reform to keep pace with economic \ndevelopment can introduce barriers to structural transformation.\nThe other set of determinants involve market failures such as \ncoordination problems that result from the high cost of collating and \nprocessing information on new products, technologies, and industries, \nand credit market failures. Both of these market failures involve \nexternalities and information asymmetries.\n\nCoordination problems typically arise when externalities create \n\nsigni\ufb01cantly large differences between private and social returns. \nIn\u00a0particular, a problem arises when externalities depress private \nreturns. Investment in new technology, for example, is risky, with \nthe \ufb01rst mover typically bearing the brunt of the risk. Meanwhile, \nsuccessful investment invites the entry of other investors and undercuts \nthe \ufb01rst mover\u2019s effective rate of return on the investment. To avoid \nexposure to this risk, the investor may forego the investment unless it \nis possible to prevent or delay the entry of competition, even though \nsociety would view competition as bene\ufb01cial. This state of affairs \ndiscourages investment in new technology and the adoption of new \nproduction processes unless governments intervene. \n\nCredit market failures often stem from bad choices and moral \nhazards in the allocation of loans. Developing economies typically \nhave underdeveloped \ufb01nancial markets and suffer severe information \nasymmetries. In addition, misguided government policies can force \nthe misallocation of credit, making it difficult to obtain \ufb01nancing \nfor new projects with promise and to scale up operations that have \nalready proven their worth (Le\u00f3n-Ledesma and Christopoulos 2016). \nThe\u00a0resulting low rate of investment and small scale of operations in \nhigh-productivity sectors slows the pace of structural transformation. \nTo overcome credit market failures, governments can implement \nselective credit policies by providing credit directly to targeted sectors \nand indirectly through loan guarantees.\n\nMacroeconomic determinants \nof\u00a0potential\u00a0growth\nThe panel of Asian countries under study is augmented by including \nother economies, both emerging and advanced, to arrive at a total of \n69 economies studied over the period 1960\u20132014 (the list is reported \nin Table\u00a02.2.1). As potential growth is the sum of the growth rates of \npotential labor productivity and the labor force, the analysis needs to \naccount for both components. Moreover, the decomposition analysis \nindicates that potential labor productivity growth is attributed mostly to \nproductivity growth within sectors.\n\nThe search for the determinants of productivity growth is complex \nbecause the literature provides a long list. To overcome this difficulty, \nvarious procedures for model selection were devised with the objective \nof determining which variables robustly correlate with economic \ngrowth (e.g., Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer, and Miller 2004).

Fiji and Papua New Guinea were not included in the regression \nanalysis for lack of data, but the model estimates include the other 20 developing economies in\u00a0Asia.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nBenchmark model results\nThe coefficient of working-age population growth is the elasticity \nof potential output with respect to that variable. It is statistically \nsigni\ufb01cant and at the same time not signi\ufb01cantly different from 1. \nThis\u00a0is\u00a0consistent with the de\ufb01nition of the natural or potential growth \nrate used in this chapter. The results also indicate that working age is a \ngood proxy for the potential growth rate of the labor force.\n\nThe process of capital accumulation has as its proxy initial income \n\nper capita. The rationale is that a poor country has a low ratio of \ncapital to labor, which translates into potential to grow quickly. \nThis\u00a0is\u00a0driven primarily by the greater opportunity to accumulate capital. \nThe\u00a0coefficient in the benchmark model implies that an additional \n$1,000 of initial income per capita lowers potential output growth by \n0.33\u00a0percentage points.\n\n\f64\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nUsing the preferred speci\ufb01cation shown in the left column of \nTable\u00a02.2.3, it\u00a0is determined that the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary \neducation and an economy\u2019s openness to international \ufb02ows of goods and \nservices have quadratic effects. This means that the effect of these two \nvariables on potential growth increases but only up to a limit.\n\nMeanwhile, coefficients on the technology gap and the three proxies \nfor institutional quality are statistically signi\ufb01cant. The positive sign of \nthe technology gap variable is consistent with the observation that the \nadvantage of backwardness dissipates as the gap narrows. The\u00a0possibility \nthat institutional quality may also affect potential growth indirectly is \nalso considered. For example, Kose et al. (2009) suggested that the effect \nof integration on international \ufb01nancial markets may be dependent upon \ninstitutional quality. To explore this possibility, interaction variables \nare speci\ufb01ed involving the technological gap with the US and political \nstability, and \ufb01nancial capital integration and regulatory quality. If the \nimpacts of the technological gap and of the integration index depend on \ninstitutional quality, then the interaction terms should turn out to be \nsigni\ufb01cant. \n\nThe empirical results show that the gap with the US has a positive \nand signi\ufb01cant impact on potential growth for the entire range of values \nof the index of political stability, and its effect is smaller for countries \nwith greater political stability. A 1 percentage point reduction in the gap \nwith the US raises potential output growth by 0.085 percentage points for \nthe least politically stable countries and 0.055 percentage points for the \nmost politically stable.6 This means that economies that are far from their \nproductivity frontiers and that also have lower political stability can be \nexpected to reap larger bene\ufb01ts from technological spillovers.\n\nInstitutional quality also affects the impact of \ufb01nancial integration. \nMoreover, the effect becomes higher for small values of regulatory quality, \nwith a maximum of 0.0115 percentage points for countries with the lowest \nregulatory quality.7 This result may seem counterintuitive at \ufb01rst. From \na policy viewpoint, however, it means that \ufb01nancial integration acts as \na substitute for high-quality institutions. For\u00a0emerging economies with \nlow-quality institutions, including some in Asia, the implication is that \nsuccessful integration into international \ufb01nancial markets may bring about \nsigni\ufb01cant long-term growth bene\ufb01ts by raising the potential growth rate.\n\nIncorporating macro stability\nThe benchmark model is extended by including two variables that capture \nbusiness cycle features. The \ufb01rst is the actual\u2013potential growth gap, the \naverage of the deviation between an economy\u2019s actual growth rate and \nits potential in the previous 5 years. This variable measures the average \ndistance between actual and potential growth rates. A statistically \nsigni\ufb01cant coefficient implies that expansionary or recessionary phases \naffect the potential growth rate.8 The second is growth gap volatility, \nmeasured as the standard deviation of the actual\u2013potential growth gap \nduring the previous 5 years. This variable measures the volatility of actual \ngrowth with respect to the potential growth rate. This captures the \npossible effects of business cycle features, such as growth volatility, on \npotential growth. \n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200265\n\nThe coefficient on growth gap volatility is signi\ufb01cant with the \nexpected negative sign. The results suggest that reducing volatility by \n1\u00a0percentage point brings about an increase in potential growth of about \n0.193 percentage points. This outcome is in line with other evidence in \nthe literature (e.g., Ramey and Ramey 1995) and indicates that higher \ngrowth volatility may harm the potential growth rate and, consequently, \nthat demand-management policies aiming to stabilize actual growth \nnear potential growth can bene\ufb01t the economy\u2019s long-term performance.\n\nPotential growth, misallocation,  \nand institutional obstacles\nThe impact of reducing or eliminating institutional barriers to factor \nmobility is examined in this section. The analysis considers the factors \nthat affect structural transformation. The concept of frontier potential \ngrowth is related to activities and operations at the level of the \ufb01rm \nthat misallocate factors of production. This analysis complements the \nresults on determinants of potential growth, particularly the importance \nof institutional variables. Better institutions facilitate the efficient \nallocation of productive resources, bringing potential growth closer to \nthe frontier and pushing up the frontier itself.\n\nA further motivation for the \ufb01rm-level analysis is that differences in \nincome per capita across economies are explained mostly by differences \nin productivity (Caselli 2005). According to the recent literature, \ndifferences in productivity and their persistence are attributed in turn \nto resource misallocation (Kalemli-Ozcan and Sorensen 2012). Factors \nof production are said to be misallocated if a different allocation of the \ncurrent aggregate endowment of capital and labor across \ufb01rms would \nincrease the economy\u2019s aggregate productivity.\n\nMisallocation is generated by obstacles. These create in turn \ndistortions or wedges in the marginal products of capital and labor \nacross \ufb01rms. For example, subsidized credit makes the marginal product \nof capital arti\ufb01cially low for \ufb01rms receiving the subsidy and arti\ufb01cially \nhigh for other \ufb01rms. The result is that subsidized \ufb01rms are more capital \nintensive than they otherwise would be, and unsubsidized \ufb01rms are \nmore labor intensive. The outcome is a misallocation of resources. \nEliminating the credit subsidy and other distortions allows resources to \nbe better allocated, resulting in faster productivity growth.\n\nSurveys reveal a list of issues that \ufb01rms consider to be important \n\nfor them: inspection rules, access to credit, corruption, and labor \nregulations, among others. The implication is that an economy\u2019s \npotential rate of growth is not independent of policy. Understanding \nthe role of these obstacles is therefore important from a policy and \ninstitutional perspective. \n\nTwo types of wedges or distortions on the marginal product of \ncapital and labor across \ufb01rms are calculated by comparing each \ufb01rm\u2019s \nfactor shares of labor and capital with the average of the economy. \nThe measures are explained in more detail in Box 2.2.2. The \ufb01rst is a \nmeasure of output distortion, wherein the marginal products of capital \nand labor increase by the same proportion. An example is inspection \n\n\f66\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nrules that affect \ufb01rms beyond a certain size. If there are no distortions, \nthe share of labor in total value added is equal across all \ufb01rms. However, \nif a \ufb01rm avoids inspection rules by being smaller than the optimal size, \nit will employ fewer workers and hence the labor share will be smaller \nthan the average. Therefore, the ratio of the \ufb01rm\u2019s labor share to the \naverage of the economy is a useful measure of output distortion.\n\nThe second is a measure of factor market distortion. These distortions \n\nalter the use of capital relative to labor, making the ratio different from \nwhat is optimal. As noted above, lack of access to credit reduces \ufb01rms\u2019 \nuse of capital, making them more labor intensive than they would \notherwise be. Note that, if there were no distortions, the ratio of the \nshares of capital and labor would be the same across \ufb01rms. Factor \nmarket distortion is therefore measured by comparing the \ufb01rm\u2019s labor to \ncapital ratio with the average ratio in the economy. \n\nFirm-level data for 62 developing economies obtained from \nWorld\u00a0Bank Enterprise Surveys data\u2014the Standardized Data for \n2006\u20132014\u2014are used for empirical analysis. This is a strati\ufb01ed survey \nof \ufb01rms that contains \ufb01nancial and business environment information. \nThe\u00a0original data set contains 134 surveys that cover a total of 61,669 \n\ufb01rms. However, the sample is considerably reduced when the data \nare cleaned. Since multiple cross-sectional surveys are available for \nsome economies, only those with the largest number of \ufb01rms are kept, \nsuch that every economy is represented only once. The \ufb01nal sample is \nmade up of 62 economies and a maximum of 21,539 \ufb01rms. Details are \nprovided in Le\u00f3n-Ledesma (2016). The empirical analysis will determine \nto what extent certain obstacles to a \ufb01rm\u2019s operations explain the \ntwo\u00a0distortions.\n\nSince the distortion is measured as the difference from the country \nmean, the average distortion within an economy is zero by construction. \nTherefore, to see how distortions differ across economies, one needs \nto look at some other aspect of the distribution such as the standard \ndeviation. The standard deviation, a measure of how dispersed the \ndistortion is within an economy, is calculated using the sample of \ufb01rms \nwithin each economy. As shown in Table 2.2.4, the output distortion \nis more dispersed on average than the factor market distortion in the \nfull\u00a0sample of 62 economies and in the subsample of 13 Asian\u00a0ones. Also, \nthe dispersion of both distortions is slightly wider in the Asian\u00a0economies.\n\n2.2.4\u2002Within-economy dispersion of the misallocation measures\n\nAll 62 economies (21,539 firms)\n\nOutput distortion\n\nFactor distortion\n\nOutput distortion\n\nFactor distortion\n\n13 Asian economies (10,593 firms)\n\nMean\n\nMin\n\nMax\n\n1.6288\n\n1.3958\n\n1.7110\n\n1.4966\n\n0.7257\n\n0.8579\n\n1.3639\n\n1.0342\n\n2.3836\n\n3.0764\n\n2.2137\n\n2.1345\n\nNote: Within-economy dispersion is the standard deviation of the distortion across the sample firms within \neach economy.\nSource: ADB estimates based on data from the Standardized Data 2006\u20132014, World Bank Enterprise Survey.\n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200267\n\n2.2.2\u2002Distortion measures and misallocation\n\nMeasures of distortion are derived from the Hsieh and \nKlenow (2009) theoretical framework. The framework \nproposes a model with heterogeneous firm productivity \nand two types of distortions: output distortions (\uf074y) and \nfactor market distortions (\uf074k). Output distortions increase \nthe marginal products of capital and labor by the same \nproportion, and factor market distortions raise the marginal \nproduct of capital relative to that of labor. Because these \ndistortions are specific to individual firms and different for \neach one, they introduce dispersion in firms\u2019 incentives to \nemploy factors of production.\n\nThe framework assumes that output (Y) is produced \n\ni\n\n\uf03d\n\nusing labor (L) and capital (K) with a Cobb\u2013Douglas \n\uf061\uf02d\n1\nY A K L\uf061\n, where Ai is firm-specific \ntechnology as \ni\ni\ntotal factor productivity (TFP). With competitive markets, \n\uf061 and (1 \u2013 \uf061) are the aggregate capital and labor shares, \nrespectively, in total value added (or total costs). Firms \nmaximize profits (subject to this production technology):a\n\ni\n\n\uf070\ni\n\n\uf03d\n\nmax (1\nK L\n,\n\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\n\uf02d\n\uf074\ny i\n,\n\n)\n\nPY wL\n\uf02d\ni\ni\n\ni\n\n(1\n\uf02d \uf02b\n\n\uf074\nk i\n,\n\nrK\n)\n\ni\n\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb  \n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere w and r are the wage rate and the rental price of \ncapital, respectively, and they are assumed to be equal \nacross firms since factor markets are competitive. Note that \nthe output distortion \uf074y,i affects output, while factor-market \ndistortion \uf074k,i affects the cost of capital. Also note that TFP \nand the two distortions are firm-specific, thus causing \nmisallocation as explained in the main text. To\u00a0obtain \nmeasures of the two distortions with a counterpart in \nthe data, Hsieh and Klenow (2009) uses the first order \nconditions of the maximization problem. After a few \ntransformations, they are as follows:\n\n1\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf074\nk i\n,\n\n\uf03d\n\n1\n\n\uf03d\n\uf074 \uf071\n\uf02d\n\ny i\n,\n\n\uf061\n\uf02d\n\n(1\n\n)\n\uf061\n\nwL\ni\nrK\n\ni\n\nwL\ni\nPY\n)\n\uf02d\n\uf061\ni\ni\n\n(1\n\n \n\n \n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere (1 + \uf074k,i(cid:30)) and (1 \u2013 \uf074y,i(cid:30)) are the measures of the two \ndistortions. Equation (2) indicates that if \uf074k,i = 0, i.e., if \nthere is no misallocation, the left-hand side equals\u00a01, \n\nwhich implies that \n1\n)\n\uf061\n\n\uf074\nk i\n,\n\n(1\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf061\n\uf02d\n\nwL\ni\nrK\n\ni\n\n (the firm\u2019s relative share) is equal  \n\nto\u00a0 (1\n\n)\uf061\n\n\uf02d\n\uf061\n\n, or the economy\u2019s relative share; that is, \n\nin the absence of distortions, all firms have the same \nrelative factor share. On\u00a0the other hand, when there is \na factor market distortion, the ratio of labor to capital \ncompensation is higher if the distortion is positive, or \nsmaller if the distortion is negative, than the ratio of the \naggregate shares, and the firm is more labor intensive \nor capital intensive than would be otherwise be optimal. \nFor\u00a0example, \uf074k,i will be high for firms with problems \naccessing credit, and low otherwise. Likewise, equation\u00a0(3) \n\nindicates that if \uf074y,i = 0, i.e., if there is no misallocation, all \nfirms should have the same labor share, (1 \u2013 \uf061) (\uf071 is a term \nthat captures the effect of the price elasticity of demand). \nOn the other hand, when there is an output distortion, the \nfirm\u2019s labor share is higher if the distortion is negative, \nor smaller if the distortion is positive, than the aggregate \nlabor share, so the firm will be either larger or smaller \nthan is optimal. For example, \uf074y,i will be high for firms that \nface restrictions on size, and low for firms that benefit \nfrom output subsidies.\n\nAt the level of the individual economy, the dispersion of \n\nthe distortions, as measured by the standard deviation, is \nan index of misallocation. This is because, as noted above, \nin the absence of distortions all firms have the same shares \nand hence the dispersion is zero.\n\nThe empirical strategy follows from the framework. \nThe\u00a0logarithms of the two distortions (1 + \uf074k,i(cid:30)) and (1 \u2013 \uf074y,i(cid:30)) \nare regressed on 15 obstacles that are declared by firms \nto affect their operations. To quantify the effect of the \nobstacles, a dichotomous or dummy variable is created; it \ntakes a value of 1 if a firm answered that the obstacle was \n\u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cvery severe,\u201d and otherwise it takes 0 (i.e., it \nwas \u201cno obstacle,\u201d \u201cminor,\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d). This is done \nseparately for the large sample containing 21,539 firms and \nfor the reduced sample of 10,593 Asian firms (the exact \nnumber of firms varies depending on whether all firms \nreplied or not). The regressions take the form \n\nlog Distortion a\n\n\uf03d \uf02b\n\n \n\n\uf0e5\n\n15\n\ni\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf067\ni\n1\n\nX\n\ni\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf064\n\nFirm size\ni\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf0e5\n\ncountry dummies\n\nfor each of the two distortions, and for the firms in the \ncomplete sample of countries and for the firms in the \nsample of Asian countries (i.e., a total of four regressions). \nXi denotes the 15 obstacles considered, and the proxy for \nfirm size is the number of employees, full-time equivalent. \nThe complete sample includes 62 country dummies \n(fixed effects) and the Asian sample 13 country dummies. \nOf\u00a0interest would be whether the coefficients \uf067i are \nstatistically significant or not. Note that, in the absence of \nmisallocation, all factor shares should be equal and so the \nobstacles should not be good predictors of the distortions. \nIf, on the other hand, there is misallocation and it relates \nto firms\u2019 declared obstacles, then the latter should be good \npredictors of the distortions.\n\na  The model assumes that all firms use the same Cobb\u2013Douglas \n\nproduction function. Therefore, in equilibrium, \uf061 is the \n\u201caverage\u201d capital share in the economy. In practice, Hsieh and \nKlenow (2009) allow for \uf061 to differ across sectors.\n\nReference:\nHsieh and Klenow 2009.\n\n\f68\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nMeasures of institutional obstacles are also obtained from \nthe same database. Fifteen such obstacles to \ufb01rms\u2019 operations are \nconsidered. Firms are asked whether a speci\ufb01c obstacle is important \nfor their operations. Table 2.2.5 presents the list of 15 obstacles and \ntheir prevalence in the data set for all economies and for the 13 in the \nAsian\u00a0subsample. Generally, Asian \ufb01rms declare that they face lower \nobstacles than their counterparts in other regions, especially in terms of \ninformal competitors, corruption, and access to \ufb01nance.

Are there differences between the \ufb01rms that declare \nthese obstacles to be major or severe and those that declare them only \nmoderate or minor? To answer these questions, the empirical strategy \nsummarized in Box 2.2.2 is carried out.\n\nRegression coefficients of the obstacle dummy variables, together \n\nwith their 95% con\ufb01dence intervals, are plotted for each of the \n15\u00a0obstacles in Figures 2.2.7 and 2.2.8. Results in blue correspond to \nthe regressions using \ufb01rms in all economies, and results in orange \nrefer to Asian \ufb01rms. Each regression coefficient times 100 indicates the \ndifferential, as percentage change in the distortion, between a \ufb01rm that \ndeclares that an obstacle is major or very severe and a \ufb01rm that declares \nthat it is not important, minor, or moderate. A statistically insigni\ufb01cant \ncoefficient should be interpreted as evidence that the obstacle is not \na signi\ufb01cant determinant of misallocation.

Therefore, \nthese \ufb01rms are larger than they would be if both factors were \nnot misallocated. This is the case for infrastructure obstacles \nsuch as poor electricity and transportation, and for customs \nand trade regulations. This indicates that \ufb01rms are forced \nto grow beyond their optimal size to overcome the negative \neffects of lack of infrastructure. A similar result was obtained \nfor tax rates, the efficiency of tax administration, corruption, \nand labor regulations. Overall, the largest coefficients \nare those of customs and trade and labor regulations, at \napproximately 0.2. This can be interpreted to mean that \ufb01rms \nthat declare these two obstacles as major or severe have a \nlabor share that is 20% higher than \ufb01rms that declare these \ntwo obstacles not important.\n\nMeanwhile, a negative coefficient in these regressions \nindicates that the labor share of the \ufb01rms that declare an \nobstacle as major or severe is smaller than the average. \nTherefore, these \ufb01rms are smaller than they would be \nwithout the distortion. This is the case for informal sector \ncompetitors, access to land, theft and other crime, courts, \naccess to \ufb01nance, and poor education. These obstacles act as \na tax that holds \ufb01rm size below optimal. Firms that declare \nthese two obstacles to be major or severe have a labor share \n20%\u201330% less than those \ufb01rms that declare that these \nobstacles are not important.\n\nFor the factor market distortion regressions, a positive \ncoefficient implies that the share of labor relative to capital \nis higher than the economy average and that \ufb01rms are \ntherefore more labor intensive than they would be without the \ndistortion. This is the case for courts, access to \ufb01nance, labor \nregulations, and inadequate education. For these obstacles, \nthe difference in the share of labor relative to capital between \n\ufb01rms that are affected and those that are not is approximately \n10%. On\u00a0the other hand, a negative coefficient implies that \nthe share of labor relative to capital is lower than the average \nand that \ufb01rms are therefore more capital intensive than \nthey would be without the distortion. This\u00a0is the case for \nelectricity and corruption, with coefficients also at about 10%. \nThese results lead to the conclusion that the institutional \nobstacles predict both output and factor market distortions. \nIn aggregate, these factors are key determinants of \nproductivity differences across economies. The evidence \nshows clear dispersion in the distortions faced by \ufb01rms in the sample \nof 62 developing economies. These distortions strongly correlate with \ninstitutional obstacles that prevent the efficient allocation of resources \nbetween \ufb01rms. Removing these obstacles would facilitate substantial \nfactor reallocation at the micro level.\n\n\f70\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nThe analysis indicates that most of the 15 obstacles appear to affect \ndistortions that in\ufb02uence the optimal size of \ufb01rms. On the other hand, \nmany of the obstacles appear to be statistically insigni\ufb01cant in the \nanalysis of factor market distortions. Only courts, access to \ufb01nance, \nlabor regulations, inadequate education, electricity, and corruption are \nsigni\ufb01cant. \n\nThe top three obstacles mentioned by the Asian \ufb01rms are generally \n\nsigni\ufb01cant determinants of distortions in the regressions discussed \nabove. Electricity, corruption, labor laws, access to \ufb01nance, education, \nand courts are signi\ufb01cant drivers of distortions affecting both output \nand factor markets. Policy aiming to alleviate misallocation should \nprioritize addressing these obstacles. For instance, infrastructure \nobstacles such as electricity appear to be very important drivers of \nmisallocation in the poorest countries. In the PRC, fewer obstacles are \ndeclared major or severe. However, tax rates appear to be an important \ndeterminant of misallocation by acting as a subsidy on size. In\u00a0Indonesia, \nBangladesh, and Pakistan, access to electricity, which distorts both \noutput and factor markets, is a priority area to reduce misallocation and \nenhance potential growth through productivity gains.\n\nAsia\u2019s aggregate productivity growth would increase through \nthe efficient reallocation of resources at the \ufb01rm level. This could be \nachieved through reform to policy on \ufb01nancial and labor markets and on \nland access, as well as from infrastructure improvements. Such reform \ncould offset part of the natural decline in potential growth that arises as \nAsian economies become more developed.\n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200271\n\nA \u201cnew normal\u201d for \npotential\u00a0growth?\n\nPotential growth since the global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009 differs \nsharply from before it. Is this a new normal for Asia? The macro model \nin the previous section (Table 2.2.2) gives some indication that the period \nsince the global \ufb01nancial crisis has turned less favorable for potential \ngrowth. The model includes a binary variable equal to 1 for the period \n2008\u20132014 and 0 otherwise. The statistically signi\ufb01cant coefficient \non this variable in both the benchmark model and the macro stability \nmodel indicates that potential growth in the global sample was lower \nin the post-crisis period than its historical trend. Even\u00a0after controlling \nfor changes in the other determinants of potential growth, it was down \n2.7\u00a0percentage points in the benchmark model. The\u00a0decline is less for \nAsia at about 2.2 percentage points, but this too is a sizeable\u00a0drop.9\n\nWhile the region\u2019s potential remains above the trough hit during \nthe Asian \ufb01nancial crisis of 1997\u20131998, internal factors suggest that the \ncurrent moderation has yet to run its course. An important implication \ndrawn from the analysis of the determinants of potential growth is that \nthe region\u2019s potential has started to decline because the factors that \nallowed Asia to grow quickly in earlier decades have started to fade. \nThis is true of both the demographic dividend (at least in \nsome economies) and factors that affect labor productivity, \nsuch as education, trade, and \ufb01nancial capital integration. \nAs\u00a0a result, without structural reform, potential growth \nin many regional economies will slide further because of \nunfavorable demographics, convergence with advanced \neconomies, and spillover from growth moderation in the PRC.\n\nThe fading demographic dividend\nEconomic theory and the evidence presented in this chapter \nindicate that the growth rate of the working-age population \nhas a direct proportional impact on the potential growth \nrate. Recalling the de\ufb01nition of the potential growth rate \nas the sum of labor productivity growth and labor force \ngrowth, and using World Bank projections of the growth \nrate of the Asian working-age population in 2015\u20132020, \nthe contribution of this element of potential growth can be \nassessed as either increasing or decreasing relative to 2008\u2013\n2014. Figure 2.3.1 shows that, in most Asian economies under \nconsideration, working-age population growth is projected \nto be lower in 2015\u20132020 than in 2008\u20132014.

It shows that, with the exception \nof Sri\u00a0Lanka, average population growth is expected to be lower in \n2015\u20132020 than in 2008\u20132014 in all developing economies in Asia.\nAlso reported in Table 2.3.2 are estimates of potential growth \n\nper capita for 2015\u20132020. Using the estimated average potential \ngrowth rate and actual population growth in 2008\u20132014, an estimate \nof potential growth per capita in this period is \ufb01rst constructed and \nshown in column\u00a02. Next, based on the two projected estimates of \npotential growth in 2015\u20132020 combined with population growth \nprojections, measures of potential growth rate per capita in 2015\u20132020 \nare constructed. These\u00a0estimates are based on the 2008\u20132014 average \nvalue of the estimated potential growth rate (column 3) and on the \n2014 estimated potential growth rate (column 5). Results indicate that \nthe average potential growth rate per capita will be between 5.31% and \n5.72%. Columns 4 and 6 show the difference with respect to average \npotential growth in 2008\u20132014, with negative values indicating that \nannual potential growth per capita is projected to be lower in 2015\u20132020 \nthan in 2008\u20132014.\n\n\f74\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nThe results in Table 2.3.2 suggest that, notwithstanding the \n\nprojected slowing of population growth in 2015\u20132020, potential growth \nper capita in Asia is expected to fall relative to 2008\u20132014 by an average \nof 0.17\u20130.58 percentage points annually. This is because the fall in \nworking-age population growth over the period outstrips the fall in total \npopulation growth. Living standards will rise more slowly over the next \nfew years than in 2008\u20132014.\n\nFading advantage of backwardness\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s past success has narrowed the gap with the advanced \neconomies. The econometric results in the previous section show that \na smaller technological gap relative to the US will reduce potential \ngrowth. The so-called advantage of backwardness, which allowed \ndeveloping economies in Asia to grow by adopting existing technologies, \nis fading as they converge in sophistication with the advanced \neconomies. With less scope for playing catch-up with the advanced \neconomies, growth in many Asian economies will depend more on some \nother determinants of potential growth, such as tertiary education and \ntrade. On the other hand, low- and middle-income economies still have \nscope to bene\ufb01t from the convergence effect.\n\nSpillover from PRC growth moderation\nActual growth in the PRC is forecast to moderate further, from 6.9% in \n2015 to 6.5% in 2016 and 6.3% the year after. The trend is an adjustment \nto several important structural changes, notably the end of the stage \nin development during which less productive labor can be drawn from \nrural areas into more productive manufacturing. This kept wages \ndown in the past and helped the PRC attract considerable foreign \ndirect investment, but now wages have begun to rise. A legacy of past \npopulation policies is particularly unfavorable demographics, as the \nbene\ufb01ts from a relatively youthful population turn rapidly into a burden \nas the population ages. Moreover, the economy is shifting its growth \nmodel from a heavy reliance on investment to one in which consumption \nis the primary driver.\n\nAs Asia\u2019s largest economy, and the second largest in the world, \n\nthe PRC exerts a signi\ufb01cant role as an engine of global growth, \nso concerns about slowdown in the PRC are certainly warranted. \nHowever, whether the consequences of the slowdown persist for years \nor decades will depend critically on its relationship with potential \noutput growth and, in particular, with productivity growth in other \neconomies. It is thus important to understand whether natural rates \nof growth in other Asian economies move signi\ufb01cantly in tandem with \nthe PRC. Theoretically, there are several possible channels that can \nunderpin such a relationship. Trade relations with the PRC could foster \nproductivity-enhancing structural change in other economies, accelerate \ntechnological transfer, and foster competition-driven efficiency gains, \nfor example. Change could also re\ufb02ect the global demand effects. \n\nThe benchmark model is augmented to test whether actual growth \n\nin the PRC has an effect on potential growth in the global sample. \n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200275\n\nSimilarly, actual growth in the US is included as the world\u2019s \nlargest economy may have an even bigger impact on growth \nthan the PRC. The\u00a0estimate of the model including these \nspillovers is shown in Table\u00a02.3.3.\n\nThe results shown in Table 2.3.3 can be interpreted as \n\nestimates of the degree of co-movement between actual \ngrowth rates in the PRC and the US and potential growth \nrates in the rest of the world.11 PRC and US growth rates \nboth turn out to be positive and signi\ufb01cant. Results from \nthe model indicate that each 1 percent of actual growth in \nthe PRC is associated with a rise of about 0.2 percentage \npoints in average potential growth in the global sample. \nThe\u00a0corresponding effect from the US is nearly twice as \ngreat, at 0.39 percentage points. \n\nConcluding remarks\nIt is important to emphasize that the natural rate of growth \nis contingent on policies that affect the mobilization and \nreallocation of resources in the economy. As the regression \nresults show, policies can change an economy\u2019s potential \ngrowth rate, possibly counterbalancing the effects of factors \nthat lead to a decline in equilibrium growth. Thus,\u00a0the \u201cnew \nnormal\u201d should not be taken as a natural constant but one \nthat can re\ufb02ect policy decisions, for better or worse. As the \norganization of markets and governments changes over time, \npotential growth may move closer to the frontier potential \ngrowth rate.\n\n2.3.3\u2002 Modeling the impact of slower growth in the PRC \n\nand the US\n\nInitial GDP per capita\n\nWorking-age population growth\n\nGap with the US\n\nUS gap x political stability\n\nTertiary enrollment ratio\n\nTertiary enrollment squared\n\nLabor market rigidity\n\nVoice and accountability\n\nGovernment effectiveness\n\nTrade ratio\n\nTrade ratio squared\n\nFinancial capital integration\n\nFinancial capital x regulatory quality\n\nBreak in 2008\u20132014\n\nPRC growth\n\nUS growth\n\nNumber of economies\n\nNumber of observations\n\nSpillover\n\n\u20130.00034\n\n1.0228**\n\n0.081924^\n\n\u20130.00395\n\n0.08522\n\n\u20130.00109^\n\n\u20133.0915**\n\n1.6002\n\n1.55105**\n\n0.057578**\n\n\u20130.00005*\n\n0.00099\n\n\u20130.00206^\n\n\u20131.93914**\n\n0.20185**\n\n0.39016*\n\n59\n\n411\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States.\nNotes: ** indicates significance at 1%, * at 5%, and ^ at 10%.

This implies that policies that aim to raise the actual growth rate \nabove the potential have only a temporary effect. Demand-side policies \nare less effective than supply-side policies in restoring potential output. \nPolicy decisions that affect factor reallocation and productivity gains \ncan reactivate growth for long periods, thus offsetting any potential \ngrowth losses from the exhaustion of growth patterns typical of the \ninitial stages of economic development.\n\n\f76\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nPolicies to invigorate \npotential\u00a0growth\n\nSimulations to evaluate the implications of changes in the determinants \nof potential growth can provide a quantitative basis for policy \nrecommendations. In the previous section, the effect of demographics \non potential output growth was calculated (Table 2.3.2). The effects of \nthe other determinants are assessed by way of a simulation that uses the \nestimates of the determinants of potential output growth reported in the \ntwo models in Table 2.2.2. \n\nFuture potential growth: a simulation\nThis section builds on the intuition that, for most of the determinants of \npotential growth that were found to be signi\ufb01cant, it is possible to de\ufb01ne a \nfrontier value\u2014that is, a particular value for which the impact on potential \ngrowth is maximized or, as in the case of the technological gap, has been \ncompletely exhausted.12 Building on this and a number of additional \nassumptions, a scenario for a 10-year period is considered over which the \neffects of the assumed changes in the determinants of potential growth are \nevaluated. Speci\ufb01cally, for each one of the relevant variables included in the \nexercise, the frontier values and speci\ufb01c assumptions are as follows:\nInitial income per capita. This variable remains constant.\nGap with the US. The technological gap with respect to the US is \nassumed to remain stable over the period considered. This is consistent \nwith a scenario in which the pace of technological innovation in the \nUS is fairly similar to the rate of technological spillover into Asian \neconomies.13\nTertiary enrollment ratio. The frontier value is a ratio of 51%, i.e., \nthe threshold beyond which any additional increase in the share of \npopulation with tertiary education has a negative effect on potential \ngrowth. \nLabor market rigidity. The frontier value of this index is 0, which \ncorresponds to the most \ufb02exible labor market regulatory framework.\nVoice and accountability. The frontier value of this index is 2.5, at \nwhich people\u2019s perceptions about political freedoms and accountability \nare most favorable. \nGovernment effectiveness. The frontier value for this index is 2.5, at \nwhich people\u2019s perceptions about the quality and effectiveness of the \npublic sector are most favorable. \nTrade ratio. The frontier value is 443%, beyond which the effects of \ntrade on potential growth become negative. It is assumed that the \nvalue of the trade ratio increases by 25 percentage points over 10\u00a0years.\nIntegration index. Because of the interaction with regulatory quality, \nthe frontier value of the integration index cannot be uniquely de\ufb01ned. \nIt is assumed that the value of the \ufb01nancial integration index increases \nby 25 percentage points over 10 years. \n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200277\n\nBased on these assumptions and de\ufb01nitions, the simulation is \n\nconducted as follows:\n1.  For each variable the difference between the latest available value \n\nand the respective frontier value as de\ufb01ned above is calculated, and \nthe distance from the frontier (DfF) is calculated.\n\n2.  It is assumed that countries close half of the DfF for each variable \n\nover a 10-year period.\n\n3.  For the tertiary enrollment ratio, labor market rigidity, voice and \naccountability, government effectiveness, and the trade ratio, \nthe impact on potential growth is constructed as the product of \nthe respective values of half of the DfF times the corresponding \ncoefficients in the benchmark model (Table 2.2.2). For the tertiary \nenrollment ratio and the trade ratio, nonlinearities are taken into \naccount by setting to zero the potential gain if the economy has \nalready achieved the frontier value.\n\n4.  As mentioned above, it is assumed that the gap with the US remains \nconstant for the 10-year period, so its impact in the simulation is set \nat zero.\n\n5.  For the trade ratio and the integration index, the assumption is \na 25% increase over the initial value. The impact of this change \non potential growth is calculated using the relevant coefficient \nestimates from the benchmark model (Table 2.2.2), holding constant \nthe regulatory quality indicator for the integration index and taking \ninto account nonlinearities in the case of trade.\n\nTwo additional channels are considered, through which \n\n2.4.1\u2002 Simulated future contributions to potential growth, \n\npolicy intervention can affect the potential growth rate. \nThe \ufb01rst is the possible effects of policies to counteract \nthe slowdown in working-age population growth, such \nas postponing retirement age and relaxing immigration \nrestrictions. Speci\ufb01cally, a scenario is considered in \nwhich policy is able to halve the projected annual decline \nin working-age population growth. The effect of this is \nreported in the line labeled \u201cDemographics\u201d in Table 2.4.1. \n(Among\u00a0the\u00a0sampled Asian economies, only Sri Lanka shows \npositive demographic changes.)\n\npercentage points\n\nItem\n\nDemographics\n\nReform\n\nStable macroeconomy\n\nTotal\n\nContribution\n\n\u20130.33\n\n\u20020.98\n\n\u20020.09\n\n\u20020.73\n\nNote: The table shows the weighted average annual contribution of \neach\u00a0determinant of potential growth to the increase in potential growth \nover a decade, as calculated in a simulation for 22 Asian economies \nin\u00a0the\u00a0sample. \nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nThe other channel incorporates the expected gains \nfrom macroeconomic stabilization policies, the proxy for \nwhich in the framework is lower volatility of actual growth \nwith respect to potential growth. Speci\ufb01cally, it is assumed that \nthe 5-year standard deviation of actual growth with respect to the \npotential growth rate (i.e., variable growth gap volatility introduced \nin the macro stability model) declines by 25% with respect to its mean \nvalue over the 1960\u20132014 period, as\u00a0a\u00a0consequence of better macro-\nmanagement policies. The impact of this change is reported in the line \nlabeled \u201cStable\u00a0macroeconomy\u201d in Table 2.4.1, and for each economy is \nconstructed as the product of the 25% fall in growth gap volatility times \nthe relevant coefficient in the macro stability model in Table\u00a02.2.3.14\n\nThe simulation is conducted to answer this question: By how much \n\nwould potential output growth increase over the 10-year period if \neconomies could close through reform half of the distance between their \n\n\f2.4.1\u2002Impact on potential growth\n\nImpact of demographics\nImpact of reform\n\nWeighted average\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nPercentage points per annum\n\n78\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\ncurrent values for each determinant and the highest possible \nvalue, and thereby reduce macroeconomic volatility? It is \nassumed that governments introduce policies that mitigate \nthe\u00a0negative effect of lower working-age population growth. \n\nSimulation results are shown in Table 2.4.1, which provides \n\nthe results of the three effects discussed earlier: the effect \nof reducing the negative impact of working-age population \ngrowth by half, the positive effect of supply-side reform, and \nthe positive effect of demand-management policies to stabilize \nactual growth around potential, effectively reducing volatility. \nIf governments manage to successfully introduce policies that \nreduce the projected decline in working-age population, then \nthe negative impact of this effect could be as small as \u20130.33 \npercentage points on average.15\n\nReform could add about 0.98 percentage points per \nannum to developing Asia\u2019s growth. The largest increases\u2014\nexperienced by Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Cambodia\u2014\nexceed 1.2\u00a0percentage point per annum (Figure\u00a02.4.1). \nThe\u00a0reforms that seem to provide the largest boost to \npotential\u00a0output growth address the labor market and \ninstitutional quality. \n\nFinally, demand-management policies could reduce \nthe volatility of actual versus potential growth and boost \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s potential growth by about 0.1 percentage \npoints per annum on average. The\u00a0sum of all these reforms \nand policies is shown in Table 2.4.1 in the line \u201cTotal.\u201d \nThe\u00a0average estimated impact on developing Asia\u2019s potential \ngrowth is 0.73\u00a0percentage points per annum.\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nSri Lanka\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndonesia\n\nIndia\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nCambodia\n\nTurkmenistan\n\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nTajikistan\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nViet Nam\n\nKazakhstan\n\nTaipei,China\n\nUzbekistan\n\nSingapore\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nPolicy implications\nEconomies with a particularly negative demographic outlook should \naim to enlarge their labor force and working-age population by adopting \nmore \ufb02exible immigration policies or incentives to increase the fertility \nrate. In the short to medium term, measures to increase female \nparticipation in the workforce and to postpone retirement age can be \neffective as well.\n\nSince the long-term growth rate of the labor force is largely \ndetermined by demographic factors, the focus of policy interventions \nto increase potential growth should be on productivity enhancement. \nIndeed, the evidence presented in this chapter indicates that whether \nthe projected decline in potential growth actually materializes \nhinges not alone on working-age population growth, but also on \nthe implementation of effective economic policies and institutional \ntransformation, as well as on changes to other determinants of potential \ngrowth that affect potential labor productivity growth. \n\nThe estimates of the determinants of potential output growth \nindicate that closing the technological gap with respect to the US, \nboosting the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education up to \nabout 51%, raising labor market \ufb02exibility, strengthening voice and \naccountability and government effectiveness, opening up to trade \n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200279\n\nto about 443% of GDP, and advancing \ufb01nancial integration into the \nworld economy can raise potential growth. These are fundamental \npillars of a successful growth strategy. Naturally, larger improvements \nin these factors will support more substantial positive effects, \nso\u00a0the straightforward policy recommendation for Asian economies \nis to focus\u00a0on devising the most efficient and effective measures \nto bring about economic and institutional change that enhances \npotential\u00a0growth. \n\nAs stated in the \ufb01rst section of this chapter, the estimate of an \neconomy\u2019s potential growth depends\u00a0on its institutions and structure. \nFrontier potential growth was de\ufb01ned as the growth rate that the \neconomy could achieve if all institutional barriers and distortions that \nobstruct\u00a0factor mobility were removed. The analysis indicates that the \nremoval of \ufb01rm-level obstacles that affect \ufb01rm size and the efficient \nallocation of capital and labor can move developing Asia\u2019s economies \ncloser to their frontier potential growth. Particular attention should be \npaid to correcting de\ufb01cient judicial systems, unequal access to \ufb01nance, \nexcessive labor regulation, inadequate education, poor electricity supply, \nand corruption, which can cause distortions within \ufb01rms and in factor \nmarkets. For example, tax system reform that is neutral with respect \nto \ufb01rm size can improve productivity. Deepening the development \nand outreach of the \ufb01nancial system can advance productivity growth \nthrough the efficient allocation of capital. \n\nDuring the transition to improved allocation, economies will already \nenjoy a higher potential growth rate. Bene\ufb01ts will derive from structural \nreforms to \ufb01nancial and labor markets, policies to improve access to \nland, strengthened governance, an improved business environment, and \nsigni\ufb01cant infrastructure investments to secure basic needs such as \nelectricity and water supply.\n\nInfrastructure should remain a priority for Asian policy makers. \n\nAs the needs are large, governments must \ufb01nd creative \ufb01nancing \nsolutions such as public\u2013private partnership. Toward facilitating private \ninvestment, policy can incentivize companies to purchase new assets by, \nfor example, accelerating depreciation.\n\nLikewise, higher potential and frontier potential growth can be \n\nachieved by relaxing government policies and addressing market \nimperfections that impede the more efficient allocation of labor, \nespecially where agricultural employment remains above a high 30%: \nAzerbaijan, Bangladesh, the PRC, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, \nSri\u00a0Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\n\nWhile increasing potential growth might seem to be an objective \n\nexclusive to economic policy, an appropriate policy mix can be \ndeployed to correct imbalances between actual and potential growth, \nand to avoid them where they threaten to emerge. The\u00a0existence \nof a signi\ufb01cant gap between actual and potential growth, and the \nresulting economic performance that is other than optimal, create \neither in\ufb02ationary pressures or unemployment. Indeed, inappropriate \npolicy interventions may widen gaps or make them more persistent, \nexacerbating the associated problems. Moreover, wider gaps are bound \nto bring about greater growth volatility that, as indicated by empirical \nevidence presented in this chapter, negatively affects potential growth. \n\n\f80\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nThis\u00a0reinforces the view that effective demand management and \nstabilization policies may have signi\ufb01cant positive effects. \n\nThe analysis indicates that such measures, and economic policy \nmore generally, can play a growing role in boosting long-term growth \nin developing Asia. As developing Asia continues its convergence with \nthe advanced economies, the advantages of backwardness will fade \nuntil they are \ufb01nally extinguished. The potential for technological \nspillover from economies on the technological frontier will decline as \nthe technology gap narrows, and the demographic dividend will turn \ninto a demographic debt as growth in working-age population slows. \nFor long-term growth to continue in Asia, and for living standards \nto improve at rates similar to the past, effective policy measures and \nimprovements in the quality of institutions will have to compensate \nfor the lost advantages of yesterday. In the aftermath of the global \n\ufb01nancial crisis, developing Asia\u2019s progress toward high-income status \nwill increasingly depend on how fast it can close the gap in policy and \ninstitutions with respect to the advanced economies.\n\nAsia\u2019s new normal today need not be its future normal. To ensure a \nhealthy future for potential growth, Asia must employ the full range of \npolicy responses to augment labor supply, improve labor productivity, \nand maintain macroeconomic stability.\n\nEndnotes\n1 \n\nA first reason, Rodrik argued, was that industrialization in the style \nof the Republic of Korea seemed to be impossible in today\u2019s world \nbecause technological change was rendering manufacturing more \ncapital and skill intensive. Second, some Asian economies would \nexperience declining labor force growth rates (e.g., the PRC and \nJapan), though others would still enjoy a demographic dividend \n(e.g., India). In the former group, productivity growth would have to \naccelerate to compensate for the shift in demographics (McKinsey \nGlobal Institute 2015). Third, the World Trade Organization has \nbegun to disallow many industrial policies widely used in the past to \npush growth (Felipe 2015), and developed countries would not be as \nwilling in the years ahead to run current account deficits so that the \ndeveloping world could run surpluses. In the Asian context, Lin and \nZhang\u00a0(2015) has argued in reference to the PRC that the GFC would \nnot have long-lasting effects and that the decline in growth was only \ntransitory.\nTwo versions of the model are available: closed economy and \nopen economy augmented with the ratio of imports to GDP, the \nlatter following Romer (1993). In total, three different versions are \nestimated: (i) actual inflation (equation [6]) and closed economy \nfor the PRC, Fiji, Japan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet\u00a0Nam; \n(ii) adaptive expectations (equation [8]) and open economy \naugmented for Azerbaijan, India, and Taipei,China; and (iii) adaptive \nexpectations (equation [8]) and closed economy for Bangladesh, \nCambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, \nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, \n\n2 \n\n\fAsia\u2019s potential growth\u2002\u200281\n\nViet\u00a0Nam, and Hong Kong, China. The model with actual inflation and \nopen economy did not fit any of the economies well. The results shown \nfor Singapore and Thailand are derived from a different model that \nincludes financial factors (Felipe et al. 2015).\nThis estimate is derived by dividing the percentage point change in \npotential growth by the percentage point change in actual growth for \nthe 22 developing Asian economies, and then taking the average.\nIt should be noted that the statistical procedure used to generate \na time-varying estimate of potential output growth (the Kalman \nsmoother) updates the complete series every time a new estimate is \nadded\u2014see details in Lanzafame et al. (2016). After adding the PRC \ngrowth rate estimate for 2015, which is 6.9%, the estimates since 2010 \nbecome lower, with a potential growth rate of 7.69% for 2014 (instead \nof 7.91%) and 7.29% for 2015.\nIndia released an updated GDP series that contains very few years, so \nthe old series was used in the model estimates. Adjusting up the\u00a0growth \nrate based on the years where the two series overlap (2012\u20132014) yields \na slightly higher potential growth rate of 6.94% in\u00a02014.\nThe direct impact of reducing the gap with the US, as indicated by \nthe coefficient of this variable, shows that a country with a gap that \nis narrower by 1 percentage point has potential growth that is slower \nby 0.07 percentage points. However, the gap with the US is also \ninteracted with the index of political stability in the model, and this \ninteraction term needs to be taken into account to fully quantify the \nimpact of the gap on potential growth. Ignoring the effects of all other \nvariables in the model, potential output growth is computed as gn = \n0.07 \u00d7 gap \u2013 0.006 \u00d7 gap \u00d7 political stability. Recall that the index of \npolitical stability ranges from \u20132.5 to 2.5, with higher positive numbers \nindicating greater political stability. The total effect of reducing the \ngap by 1 percentage point is therefore calculated as 0.07 + (0.006 \u00d7 \n2.5) = 0.085 percentage points for the least politically stable and 0.07 \n\u2013 (0.006 \u00d7 2.5) = 0.055 percentage points for the most politically stable \neconomies.\nThis is calculated as 0.004 + (0.003 \u00d7 2.5) = 0.0115 for the lowest \nregulatory quality. For values of regulatory quality above \u20130.41 the \nimpact is not statistically significant. Note that this is the impact of \nfinancial integration through regulatory quality. The\u00a0direct impact of \nfinancial capital integration is simply given by the\u00a0coefficient of this \nvariable (0.004), which means that countries with financial integration \n1 percentage point higher will have potential growth higher by \n0.004\u00a0percentage points.\nThis is approach is similar to that of Le\u00f3n-Ledesma and Thirlwall \n(2002).\nRegressions for the Asian economies alone (not shown for reasons of \nspace) are less reliable since the sample size is significantly smaller. \nNevertheless, the Asian dummy for the 2008\u20132014 structural break is \nalways negative, with values that oscillate between \u20132.0 and \u20132.3.\n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10  This is the difference between the average growth rate of the actual \nworking-age population growth rate in 2008\u20132014 and the projected \ngrowth rate for 2015\u20132020. This weighted average is computed using \npopulation shares as weights.\n\n\f82\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\n11 \n\nThe spillover model for the subpanel of Asian economies is \nestimated as well, but the results are not as reliable because the \nsample size is small.\n\n12  The methodology and terminology employed in this section are akin \nto those used by the World Bank in its Distance to Frontier exercise  \n(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/distance-to-frontier).\n13  This is a plausible assumption for the purposes of this simulation. \n\nObviously, it cannot be assumed for the longer term, over which \nmany Asian economies should continue to enjoy the so-called \nadvantage of backwardness.\n\n14  This means that coefficients from two different regressions are \n\nbeing\u00a0used. Even if all coefficients from the macro stability model \nwere used, results would be very similar.\n\n15  This is the reduction in the region\u2019s potential output growth \n\nsolely due to a lower projected trend growth rate in working-age \npopulation growth during 2015\u20132020, and assuming that countries \nimplement measures (e.g., increase fertility rates, increase females \nlabor participation, etc.) to reduce the negative impact of declining \nworking-age population growth rates by 50%. It is computed using \nindividual countries\u2019 trend growth rates of working-age population \n(not actual growth rates as in endnote\u00a010), weighted by their \nrespective GDP shares.\n\nReferences\nADB. 2013.

Demand  will  likely  remain  sluggish  in  2016  and  2017,  reducing  growth  and \ninflation  and  moderately  widening  the  current  account  deficit.  The  challenge  is  to  make  growth \ninclusive  across  regions.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe economy grew by 3.0% in 2015, down from 3.5% in 2014. On the \nsupply side, growth was driven by agriculture and industry as expansion \nin services moderated (Figure 3.1.1).\n\nAgriculture grew by 11.4%, aided by favorable weather and continued \n\ngovernment support to farmers that provided preferential loans, diesel \nfuel, seeds, and fertilizers, as well as by expansion of the cultivated area. \nIndustry excluding construction grew by 6.3%. Much\u00a0of this growth \ncame from export-oriented mining and metallurgy, re\ufb02ecting expansion \nin late 2014 at the Teghut copper mine, the country\u2019s second largest \nmine. Construction contracted by 4.2% following the 4.6% decline \nin\u00a02014. \n\nThe expansion in services, which generate about half of GDP, slowed \n\nsharply to 1.1% from 5.8% a year earlier, re\ufb02ecting a 7.1% slump in the \nremittance-supported trade subsector. Growth in services came mainly \nfrom higher growth in information technology, \ufb01nance, insurance, and \nrecreation.\n\nOn the demand side, most of the expansion stemmed from a narrower \n\nde\ufb01cit in net exports of goods and services. Public consumption \nimproved by an estimated 5.4% in 2015 on higher government spending. \nHowever, total consumption declined as private consumption contracted, \nfor the \ufb01rst time since 2009, by an estimated\u00a05.0%. This re\ufb02ected a 35.8% \nfall in remittances, mainly from the Russian Federation, from which \nremittances plunged by 42.2% (Figure 3.1.2). Total investment decreased \nby an estimated 6.4% in 2015, exceeding the 2.6% decline in 2014.\n\nIn\ufb02ation was subdued in 2015 as private consumption contracted, \nagricultural output rose, global commodity prices fell, the exchange rate \nremained relatively stable, and the Central Bank of Armenia tightened \nmonetary policy in the \ufb01rst half of the year. For the \ufb01rst time since \n2005, de\ufb02ation was recorded at the end of 2015 as the 12-month in\ufb02ation \nrate December over December fell to \u20130.1%, well below the in\ufb02ation \ntarget band of 2.5%\u20135.5% set by the central bank. Average annual \nin\ufb02ation nevertheless rose slightly to 3.7% from 3.0% in 2014, re\ufb02ecting \nlarger increases for food and other goods (Figure 3.1.3). \n\nThis chapter was written by Grigor Gyurjyan of the Armenia Resident Mission, ADB, Yerevan.\n\n3.1.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices including indirect taxes\nConstruction\nIndustry excluding construction\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n \n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n180\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\n\u201360\n\n\u2013120\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 1 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.1.2\u2002Sources of remittances\n\nRest of the world\nUnited States\nRussian Federation\n\nYear-to-date total\n\n$ million\n\n% change, year on year\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n\u201360\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2012\n\nJan\n2013\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nSource: Central Bank of Armenia. http://www.cba.am \n(accessed 1 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fMonetary policy helped not only to contain in\ufb02ation but also to \n\n3.1.3\u2002Inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\nOther goods\nServices\n\n90\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nlimit the decline in the Armenian dram as the ruble depreciated, \nwith the central bank intervening only to avoid disorderly exchange \nrate movements. In line with price and market developments, it \nadjusted policy rates periodically throughout the year. With in\ufb02ation \nexpectations well anchored, it gradually eased its policy rate from \n10.50% in February 2015 to 8.75% by year-end, and to 8.50% in \nFebruary\u00a02016. Low in\ufb02ation and only mild depreciation of the \nArmenian dram against the US dollar, by less than 2% in 2015, caused \nthe dram to appreciate during the year against the currencies of \nArmenia\u2019s leading trade partners by 2.8% in nominal effective terms and \n2.9% in real effective terms (Figure 3.1.4). \n\nStrong in\ufb02ows of foreign \ufb01nancing helped, along with higher \nexports, to raise foreign exchange reserves and offset the drop in \nremittance in\ufb02ows. Foreign exchange reserves rose by 19% to $1.8 \nbillion at the end of 2015, estimated to equal 4.4 months of imports, \nversus 3.3\u00a0months at the end of 2014. \n\nFiscal policy was mildly expansionary in 2015, supporting growth \nthrough public consumption. The ratio of revenue to GDP declined to \n22.7% in 2015 from 23.6% in 2014 as economic growth and transfers \nfrom the Eurasian Economic Union customs pool disappointed and as \ndomestic and external trade slipped. Expenditure rose to 27.3% of GDP \nfrom 25.5% a year earlier, mainly re\ufb02ecting higher capital spending \n(Figure 3.1.5). The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit rose from 1.9% of GDP in 2014 to 4.6%, \ndouble the budget target of 2.3%. \n\nHigher borrowing for infrastructure development and to cover the \nbudget de\ufb01cit raised the ratio of public debt to GDP from 43.6% in 2014 \nto 48.6% at the end of 2015 (Figure 3.1.6). Heavy reliance on external \n\ufb01nancing saw external public debt climb in nominal terms by more \nthan $0.5 billion to $4.3 billion, or 41.3% of GDP. Domestic public debt \nincreased by more than $100 million to $762 million.\n\nAs exports rose and weak domestic demand slowed import growth, \n\nthe current account de\ufb01cit narrowed to an estimated 4.6% of GDP in \n2015 from 7.3% a year earlier (Figure 3.1.7). \n\nThe trade de\ufb01cit shrank to an estimated 13.3% of GDP from 17.7% in \n2014. Imports of goods plummeted by an estimated 15.5%, while exports \nheld steady and export destinations diversi\ufb01ed somewhat. The\u00a0services \naccount continued to improve, re\ufb02ecting gains in construction, \ntelecommunications, and travel.\n\nEconomic prospects \nAlthough economic performance in 2015 beat expectations, the outlook \nremains very uncertain. Armenia is highly vulnerable to exogenous \nshocks, particularly from the Russian Federation, its main trading \npartner. With continued recession there during 2016, growth is projected \nto slow to 2.0% in 2016 before recovering slightly to 2.3% in 2017 \n(Figure\u00a03.1.8). \n\nThe growth outlook will worsen if the economy in the Russian \nFederation deteriorates further.

Also promoting \ngrowth will be greater interest from the private sector in agriculture \nusing greenhouses. \n\nGrowth in industry is expected to remain sluggish, re\ufb02ecting \nsubdued domestic and external demand. The government\u2019s renewed \nemphasis on stimulating exports will provide further impetus for \nindustry, which will also bene\ufb01t from moderate growth in construction, \nmostly from progress in externally \ufb01nanced infrastructure projects for \nroads, water supply, and school rehabilitation.\n\nA projected decline in retail trade will likely slow the rise in services, \n\nin which most growth is expected to come from gains in tourism, \n\ufb01nance, information, and communications. \n\nOn the demand side, investment and private consumption are both \n\nprojected to contract, though less than in 2015, with growth coming \nfrom a further narrowing of the de\ufb01cit in net exports. \n\nFiscal policy will be tightened gradually in the medium term, \nfollowing the \ufb01scal slippage and rise in external debt during 2015. \nThe\u00a0government projects the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit at 3.5% of GDP in 2016, with \nexpenditure remaining unchanged to accommodate lower revenue \nfrom weaker economic activity. The volume of transfers from the \nEurasian Economic Union customs pool will likely be unchanged \nin\u00a02016. Moreover, high and rising public debt will require further \ufb01scal \nconsolidation to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio and contain external \nimbalances.\n\nMonetary policy will likely support growth. Average annual \nin\ufb02ation is projected to remain subdued, at 3.8% in 2016 and 4.0% in \n2017, re\ufb02ecting slow growth and output below potential. While modest \ngrowth should put downward pressure on prices, in\ufb02ation would likely \nbe higher if external developments cause signi\ufb01cant dram depreciation. \nThe current account de\ufb01cit is projected to widen to 5.2% of GDP in \n\n2016 and then narrow to 5.0% in 2017 (Figure 3.1.9). The trade de\ufb01cit \nis forecast to continue narrowing, while the income de\ufb01cit will remain \nsmall. Exports are forecast to expand by only 0.2% in 2016 and then \nby 1.0% in 2017 as efforts to diversify markets largely offset drag from \nrecession in the Russian Federation. Imports are projected to decline \nby 1.5% in 2016, re\ufb02ecting the lagged effect of smaller remittances, and \nthen rise by 2.0% in 2017 as lower fuel and commodity prices support \nconsumption. Renewed trade with Iran could mean more trade overall, \nin particular higher exports. \n\nAn uncertain external environment will require using domestic \nmeasures to sustain growth, in particular rebuilding \ufb01scal and external \nbuffers, and implementing structural reforms to further enhance the \nbusiness environment, boost competitiveness, diversify exports and \nmarkets, and improve governance and transparency. \n\n3.1.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20023.8\n\n\u20135.2\n\n\u20022.3\n\n\u20024.0\n\n\u20135.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.1.6\u2002Public debt\n\nDomestic\nExternal\n\n \n\n% of GDP\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance. http://www.min\ufb01n.am; \nNational Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia. \nhttp://www.armstat.am (both accessed 1 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.1.7\u2002Current account components\n\nPrimary income\nSecondary income\nServices\nGoods\nCurrent account balance\n\n \n\n% of GDP\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201330\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSources: Central Bank of Armenia. http://www.cba.am \n(accessed 1 March 2016); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f92\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014attaining balanced \nregional\u00a0development\nWidening disparity between the capital city and the regions is a major \nthreat to inclusive growth over the long term. Economic activity is \nheavily concentrated in the capital, Yerevan, which accounts for more \nthan 40% of industrial production and more than 80% of trade and \nservices but has only a third of the country\u2019s population and a quarter \nof its poor. By contrast, the regions enjoy little economic opportunity or \ndiversi\ufb01cation and endure much worse poverty, dependence on worker \nremittances, and physical infrastructure. \n\nThe government recognizes that the high concentration of wealth \nin Yerevan hampers economic and human development and exacerbates \nlarge and persistent regional disparities. The Armenia Development \nStrategy to 2025, approved in 2014, aims to overcome regional disparity \nin development and prioritize over the medium and long term regionally \ntargeted development policies. The resulting programs should ensure \nfaster economic development in the most depressed regions, enabling \nthem to largely close their development gaps with national norms. \n\nA development initiative approved in 2011 emphasizes the creation, \n\nrehabilitation, and development of economic infrastructure and the \nimprovement at the regional and community level of the quality and \naccessibility of public social services for education, health care, cultural \nenrichment, and environmental protection. \n\neach locality\u2019s comparative advantages, and therefore offer potential \nfor longer-term impact, is critical for diversifying rural households\u2019 \nsources of income and enhancing the structure of regional economies. \nAlong with measures to promote private sector development, especially \nthrough small and medium-sized enterprises, such development \ninitiatives can promote job creation and thereby raise living standards \ntoward levels enjoyed in the capital. \n\nInvesting in social and economic infrastructure, including health \nand education facilities and transport, can also promote more uniform \ngrowth across the regions. Programs to improve access to markets and \nsocial services in poor regions can serve this objective, as can incentives \nfor private \ufb01rms to invest in these areas. \n\nPublic\u2013private partnership in infrastructure can be pursued to \nreduce government expenditure while allowing more projects that \npromote equity across regions.\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n \n\n%\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n3.1.8\u2002GDP growth\n% \n8\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 1 March 2016); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 1 March 2016); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nScaling up targeted economic development initiatives that build on \n\n3.1.9\u2002Current account balance\n\n\fAzerbaijan\n\nPlunging oil prices in 2015 cut export earnings, and sharp currency depreciation reduced household \nconsumption  and  public  investment,  slowing  growth  to  1.1%.  Continued  weakness  in  oil  prices  is \nprojected  to  cause  GDP  to  contract  by  1.0%  in  2016  before  recovering  to  1.0%  growth  in  2017  as \noil  prices  revive.  Only  by  financing  the  expansion  of  diverse  sectors  can  Azerbaijan  move  away \nfrom  heavy  dependence  on  hydrocarbons. \n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic growth slowed to 1.1% from 2.8% in 2014 as oil prices \nplummeted and a 50% depreciation of the Azerbaijan manat reduced \nnominal GDP by 8.0% (Figure 3.2.1). The oil sector is reported to have \nexpanded by 1.2%, following a 3.7% contraction in 2014, while cuts \nin public investment constrained the economy outside the oil sector, \nwhich\u00a0expanded by only 1.1%, down from 7.0% in 2014. \n\nOn the supply side, industry shrank by 1.9%, versus 0.5% growth \n\nin 2014, as a decline in construction outweighed improvements in \nmining and manufacturing (Figure 3.2.2). Cuts in public investment and \nlower\u00a0demand for real estate reversed 9.1% expansion in construction \nin 2014 to 13.4% contraction. Growth in services decelerated to 4.5% \nfrom 7.4% in 2014, owing to a slowdown in social and other services. \nAgriculture had the strongest increase, as government concessions on \ninputs contributed to 6.6% growth following 2.6% decline in 2014.\n\nOn the demand side, private and public consumption are believed \nto have declined because of currency depreciation and some tightening \nof lending later in the year, even as household savings grew by 31.7% \nin 2015, more than double the 12.4% growth rate in 2014. Net exports \nfell sharply because of lower oil prices, as hydrocarbons constitute \nmore\u00a0than 90% of exports.\n\nDeclining energy prices and the drop in export earnings forced the \ncentral bank to devalue the manat by 25% on 21 February 2015 and then, \non 21 December, abandon the peg to the US dollar, which precipitated \nanother plunge. The manat ended the year down by half against the \nUS dollar after repeated interventions cost the central bank more than \ntwo-thirds of its foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $4.4 billion \nat the end of January 2016, down from $13.8 billion a year earlier. \n\nOfficial reports suggest that average annual in\ufb02ation accelerated \n\nto 4.0% from 1.4% in 2014, re\ufb02ecting devaluation in February 2015 \nand higher in\ufb02ation in trading partners, and despite a decline in \nglobal food prices. The in\ufb02ation rate month on month reached 7.7% \nin December, when the manat peg was abandoned (Figure 3.2.3). \n\nThis chapter was written by Nail Valiyev of the Azerbaijan Resident Mission, ADB, Baku.\n\n3.2.1\u2002 Exchange rate and  \n\naverage crude oil price\n\nManat/$\nCrude oil price, average\n\n% change, year on year\n\nManat/$\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2.0\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nHaver\u00a0Analytics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.2.2\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n\u201360\n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f94\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nFood\u00a0prices\u00a0rose\u00a0by\u00a06.1% over the whole of 2015, while prices for other \ngoods increased by\u00a03.8%. \n\nPlunging oil prices forced a tightening of \ufb01scal policy. Despite \nrising as a share of GDP because of the decline in nominal GDP, both \nrevenue and expenditure fell in nominal terms. Revenue, including \nfrom the state\u00a0oil company, dropped by 6.7% to the equivalent of\u00a031.5% \nof GDP, slightly above 31.2% in 2014 (Figure 3.2.4). Receipts\u00a0were \nmainly transfers from the sovereign wealth fund, whose assets \nfell by $3.5 billion to $33.6 billion at the end of 2015 (Figure 3.2.5). \nTotal\u00a0expenditure declined by 4.9% as the government deferred some \ninvestment projects but still rose as a percentage of GDP to 32.7%, from \n31.7% in 2014. The budget recorded a de\ufb01cit equal to 1.1% of GDP, less \nthan the 3.0% budgeted. Total government and government-guaranteed \ndebt more than doubled to 28.1% of GDP from 11.2% at the end of 2014, \nlargely because of depreciation. \n\nMonetary policy aimed to stabilize the exchange rate for most of \n\nthe year while supporting growth. In July, the central bank cut its \npolicy rate from 3.5% to 3.0%, where it stayed for the rest of the year, to \nboost investment in the non-oil economy. This helped maintain credit \ngrowth at 20.5%, with lending rates unchanged. However, the drop in \ninternational reserves caused broad money to contract by 1.1% after \nhaving grown by 11.8% in 2014 (Figure 3.2.6). As almost half of the loan \nportfolio is denominated in foreign currencies, depreciation caused \nnonperforming loans to rise to 6.9% of all loans in 2015 from 5.2% \na\u00a0year\u00a0earlier. \n\nDollarization increased as foreign exchange deposits reached 82.5% \n\nof all deposits in January 2016, against 51.6% a year earlier. Moreover, \nbanks have come under severe pressure from depreciation and the \nresulting sharp increase in their foreign currency liabilities. Fraud was \nalleged at the country\u2019s largest bank, and the authorities announced the \ncreation of a new supervisory body for the \ufb01nancial sector. As part of \nan announced consolidation, six banks were closed in early 2016 for not \nmeeting capital requirements.\n\nLower oil prices slashed the current account surplus to an estimated \n0.4% of GDP from 13.9% in 2014, with exports falling by more than 40%. \nAccording to the State Statistical Committee, the trade surplus narrowed \nby 65.2%, or $13.7 billion, as the February 2015 devaluation did little \nto boost exports other than oil. Imports, 40% of them electronics and \nvehicles, grew by 0.4%, reversing a 14.2% decline in\u00a02014. \n\nEconomic prospects \nWithout strong \ufb01scal stimulus, the economy is projected to contract \nby 1.0% in 2016 because of continued low oil prices, followed by \n1.0% growth in 2017 as an expected revival in oil prices facilitates \neconomic recovery (Figure 3.2.7). Higher social spending should limit \nthe downturn in 2016. Despite a 10% salary increase for civil servants \nintroduced in early 2016, real household spending is expected to slow \nas\u00a0sharply higher in\ufb02ation, at 12%, reduces real incomes.\n\nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to contract in 2016 because \nof slowing oil production, but it could improve in 2017 and raise incomes \n\n3.2.3\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\nNonfood\nServices\n\n% change, year on year\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.2.4\u2002Fiscal balance\n\nTotal revenues\nState Oil Fund of Azerbaijan\nExpenditure\nFiscal de\ufb01cit\nFiscal de\ufb01cit excluding the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\n$ billion\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.2.5\u2002Strategic reserves\n\nState Oil Fund of Azerbaijan\nCentral bank reserves\nStrategic reserves\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nState\u00a0Oil Fund of Azerbaijan. http://www.oilfund.az \n(accessed 21 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nAzerbaijan\u2002\u200295\n\nif oil prices rebound. Public investment, including assistance from \ndevelopment partners for infrastructure, should stabilize construction \nin both years. Some growth in agriculture is also anticipated each \nyear with continued government support for farmers, including the \nanticipated completion of reservoir and irrigation networks.\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption and investment, both \npublic and private, will be the main sources of growth. Net exports \nshould narrow in 2016 and recover in 2017 along with oil prices, but the \ngrowth outlook remains vulnerable to any further energy price shock. \nA projected in\ufb02ation spike to 12.0% in 2016 re\ufb02ects the impact \n\nof currency depreciation on imports, which supply nearly half of \nconsumption. A projected decline in global food prices, slower income \ngrowth, and the waning effects of the currency realignment are \nprojected to slow in\ufb02ation to 5.2% in 2017 (Figure 3.2.8). However, \nin\ufb02ation will likely be higher if the manat depreciates further. \n\nWeak oil prices pose a severe challenge to \ufb01scal policy, as revenues \n\ndepend heavily on oil taxes and transfers from the state oil fund. \nRevenue\u00a0as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline to 30.2% \nin\u00a02016. However, the budget aims to support the economy with \nhigher social spending on pensions, targeted social assistance, and \nstipends, raising expenditure to 33.3% of GDP and the de\ufb01cit to\u00a03.1%. \nFollowing\u00a0amendment of the legal ceiling on external debt, total \ngovernment and government-guaranteed debt is projected to climb to \n40.9% of GDP in 2016 with investment in the Southern Gas Corridor, \nother power-related infrastructure, and transport. \n\nThe uncertain outlook for oil prices also affects the current account, \nwhich is projected to run a small de\ufb01cit equal to 0.6% of GDP in 2016 as \nexports decline by 12.2%, outpacing the decline in imports. The current \naccount is forecast to return in 2017 to a surplus of 1.5%, with some \nrecovery of oil prices and exports rising by 7.0% while imports decline \nagain, by 1.5% (Figure 3.2.9). The trade surplus is likely to remain small \nover the medium term until oil prices recover signi\ufb01cantly.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014diversi\ufb01cation through \na\u00a0stronger \ufb01nancial sector\nThe economic repercussions of declining oil prices underscore \nAzerbaijan\u2019s vulnerability as it continues to depend mainly on \nhydrocarbon revenues. With oil prices projected to remain low\u00a0for \nsome\u00a0time and oil production already likely at its maximum, \nsustainable\u00a0growth is possible only through signi\ufb01cant economic \ndiversi\ufb01cation.\n\nDiversi\ufb01cation will require, among other things, greater access to \ncredit from a more resilient \ufb01nancial sector. Small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) in particular need \ufb01nancing if they are to contribute \nto higher growth outside of the oil sector. Credit expansion requires \nstronger \ufb01nancial institutions, \ufb01nancial markets that are deeper and \nmore liquid and efficient and thus able to handle larger volumes, \nbroader domestic sources of \ufb01nance, and better access for more users of \nbanking and other \ufb01nancial services.

These moves, together with \nthe central bank\u2019s direct provision of \ufb01nance to SMEs, should make \n\ufb01nancing more available, especially in manat, thereby promoting the use \nof the local currency. \n\nand to encourage bank consolidation could strengthen the banking \nsystem by simultaneously raising capitalization and reducing costs, \nthereby enabling narrower spreads between deposit and lending \nrates. If\u00a0the emergence of several stronger and more effective banks \nensues, the sector could become more competitive. Steps to reduce the \ngovernment\u2019s presence in the sector could also help if implemented in a \nway that augments rather than inhibits competition. \n\nThe authorities have decided to introduce a single overarching \n\ufb01nancial market supervisor to regulate banks, insurers, other lenders \nincluding micro\ufb01nance institutions, and the capital market. The new \nregulator can strengthen the \ufb01nancial sector if it proves effective \nat supervising a wide array of \ufb01nancial institutions with diverse \ncharacteristics. \n\nOther measures worth pursuing would be to reform the bankruptcy \n\nlaw and reinforce creditors\u2019 rights, making banks more willing to lend \nand thus broadening access to \ufb01nance. The authorities should avoid \nany measures that would unduly constrain lending, especially by the \nmicro\ufb01nance institutions that provide services in remote areas. \n\n3.2.8\u2002Inflation \n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nADB\u00a0estimates. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nADB\u00a0estimates. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to close inadequately capitalized banks \n\n3.2.9\u2002Current account balance\n\n\fGeorgia\n\nGrowth  slowed  to  2.8%  as  a  weak  external  environment  curbed  investment,  exports,  and \nremittances.  Currency  depreciation  fueled  inflation.  With  continued  external  weakness,  growth  is \nexpected  to  remain  low  in  2016  before  recovering  in  2017  on  stronger  global  expansion.  Inflation \nis  expected  to  rise  in  2016  before  reverting,  while  the  current  account  deficit  should  narrow  in \nboth  years.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP grew by an estimated 2.8% in 2015, down from 4.6% in 2014, \nas\u00a0recession in the Russian Federation and weakness in other trading \npartners slowed investment growth and reduced manufacturing, \nexports, and remittances. \n\nOn the supply side, growth was driven by increases of 12.4% \nin construction and 13.7% in mining that offset a 2.8% decline in \nmanufacturing (Figure 3.3.1). Industry overall rose by 3.3%. Services \nexpanded by 3.0%, re\ufb02ecting strong performance in \ufb01nance and \ntourism, and agriculture grew by 2.8%. \n\nOn the demand side, domestic demand was the main driver, with \n\nprivate consumption rising by an estimated 11.9%. Investment growth \nhalved to 13.7% from nearly 28.0% a year earlier, re\ufb02ecting in part \na decline in foreign direct investment from the record set in 2014. \nWith\u00a0weak external demand and continued sluggishness in regional \ngrowth, the net exports de\ufb01cit worsened by 15.4%.\n\nIn\ufb02ation accelerated again in 2015, particularly during the \n\nsecond\u00a0half, to 4.0% (Figure 3.3.2). Higher import prices resulted from \na 27.3% depreciation in the Georgian lari vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar in \n2015 that more than offset declines in global food and energy prices. \nPrice\u00a0increases for alcoholic beverages and tobacco (11.0%), health care \n(10.5%), and furnishings, household equipment, and maintenance (9.2%), \nand a one-time rise in electricity tariffs, were partly mitigated by lower \ntransport prices from cheaper fuel. \n\nThe budget de\ufb01cit is estimated to have reached 3.7% of GDP in 2015, \n\nabove the 2.9% recorded in 2014 (Figure 3.3.3). Revenues increased by \n10.1% to equal 28.4% of GDP as both tax and nontax revenue rose, while \nonly modest growth in spending on goods and services, and a similarly \nmodest rise in social spending despite signi\ufb01cant health care outlays, held \npublic expenditure to 32.1% of GDP. Total public debt rose to 45.4% of \nGDP from 34.8% in 2014, re\ufb02ecting in part the impact of lari depreciation. \nExternal debt amounted to 78% of all debt, comprising concessional \nmultilateral or bilateral loans with an average interest rate of 1.9% in 2015. \n\nThis chapter was written by George Luarsabishvili of the Georgia Resident Mission, ADB, \nTbilisi.\n\n3.3.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n7.2\n\n6.4\n\n3.3\n\n4.6\n\n2.8\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nNote: Sector growth in 2015 is for the \ufb01rst 9 months \nover\u00a0the same period in 2014. \nSource: National Statistics Office of Georgia.  \nhttp://www.geostat.ge (accessed 3 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.3.2\u2002Inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: National Statistics Office of Georgia.  \nhttp://www.geostat.ge (accessed 3 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f98\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nMonetary policy was tightened in response to depreciation and \nrising in\ufb02ationary expectations. The National Bank of Georgia, the \ncentral bank, raised the policy rate in several steps from 4% in January \nto 8% at year-end (Figure 3.3.4). Interest rates on domestic government \ndebt rose, and average rates on lari loans increased by 2.9 percentage \npoints to 20.4%, while those in foreign currency decreased slightly to \n10.3%. Deposit interest rates followed a similar trend. Dollarization, \nas measured by the share of foreign currency deposits in the banking \nsystem, rose by 9.6 percentage points to 66.7%. Broad money (M3) grew \nby 19.3%, more than in 2014, as foreign currency deposits expanded by \nsome 44% while domestic currency deposits contracted (Figure 3.3.5). \nCredit to the economy grew by 19.4%. The share of nonperforming loans \nin all loans remained virtually unchanged at 2.7%. Although banks\u2019 \nprudential ratios remained comfortable, sector growth in pro\ufb01ts slowed \nto 13% from 22% in 2014. \n\nRecession in Georgia\u2019s main trading partners, including the \n\nRussian Federation and Ukraine, has seriously affected external\u00a0trade. \nThe\u00a0current account de\ufb01cit remained sizeable at an estimated 10.5% \nof GDP, down slightly from 10.6% in 2014, as a 20.9% drop in exports \nwidened the trade de\ufb01cit. Exports to the Russian Federation in \nparticular fell by 40.7%, while vehicle re-exports plunged by nearly 65%. \nMeanwhile, exports to the European Union rose by 3.6%. Imports\u00a0fell \nby 15.2%, as the lari depreciated against some trading partners\u2019 \ncurrencies (while appreciating by 11.0% against the ruble). Recession \nin the Russian\u00a0Federation and Ukraine contributed to a 25% decline \nin remittances. A\u00a0rise in transit tourists including transit traffic raised \ntourism receipts. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit was \ufb01nanced mainly by foreign direct \ninvestment, which nevertheless fell by some 23.2% to about $1.35 billion. \nTo smooth exchange rate \ufb02uctuations, the central bank sold during the \nyear $287 million in foreign exchange, up from $100 million in 2014. \nGross international reserves declined by 6.6% to $2.5 billion, equivalent \nto 3.4 months of imports. \n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is expected to remain near 2.5% in 2016 before rising to 3.5% in \n2017 (Figure 3.3.6). Domestic demand is expected to be the main source \nof growth, re\ufb02ecting \ufb01scal support for consumption and investment. \nAnticipated hikes in social expenditure and capital outlays are likely to \nsupport expansion in 2016 and beyond, thereby aiding growth prospects. \nA projected 16.5% yearly rise in credit should also promote growth.\n\nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to expand by 2.1% in 2016 \nand 4.0% in 2017, as the government is considering further tax measures \nto support business, such as a zero tax on reinvested pro\ufb01t. Services \nare projected to grow by 2.6% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017 on continued \nexpansion in tourism. Agriculture is expected to grow modestly, by 2.4% \nin 2016 and 3.4% in 2017, assuming favorable weather and continued \ngovernment support. \n\nExternal demand is expected to improve only modestly in 2016. \nRecovery is projected to be slow in Georgia\u2019s main trading partners as \n\n3.3.3\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nTax revenue\nNontax revenue and grants\nTotal expenditure\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n3.3.4\u2002Interest rates\n\nPolicy\nLending\nDeposit\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund. www.imf.org;  \nMinistry of Finance of Georgia. www.mof.ge \n(both\u00a0accessed 3 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u221215\n\n\u221230\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. https://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 3 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.3.5\u2002Contributions to money supply growth\n\nNet foreign assets\nNet claims on the government\nCredit to the economy\nNet other items\nBroad money (M3) growth\n\nPercentage points\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. https://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 3 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nGeorgia\u2002\u200299\n\nrecession persists in the Russian Federation.

In\ufb02ation should slow to 4.0% \nin 2017 as the effect of a one-time rise in utility tariffs wanes. It will \nbe greater than forecast if foreign prices are higher than expected, \nlari\u00a0depreciation steeper, or economic growth stronger. The central \nbank is likely to continue raising the re\ufb01nancing rate, albeit gradually. \nBroad money growth is forecast to decelerate to 14.5% in 2016 as \nprivate credit growth slows, and then rebound to 19.0% in 2017 on \nfurther government efforts to improve \ufb01rms\u2019 access to long-term \n\ufb01nance in local currency. \n\nThe upcoming cut in pro\ufb01ts tax will likely keep the budget de\ufb01cit \nabove 4.0% of GDP in 2016, despite strong revenue performance that \nshould offset higher spending for pensions and other social programs. \nThe de\ufb01cit is expected to fall slightly in 2017 as revenue is boosted by \nhigher excise taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages, by reform to \ncustoms duties, and by improvements in tax administration. Public debt \nis expected to increase to 45.8% of GDP in 2016 before easing to 44.8% \nin 2017 as foreign debt decreases (Figure 3.3.7). \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is expected to narrow to 9.5% of GDP \n\nin 2016 and 9.2% in 2017, re\ufb02ecting higher exports and remittances \n(Figure\u00a03.3.8). Exports are expected to rise by 8.5% in 2016 and 14.3% in \n2017 as vehicle re-exports and service exports accelerate. Imports are \nprojected to grow at a lower rate than exports, by 4.6% as depreciation \ndepresses imports and then by 11.6% in 2017. Net services should rise by \n10.9% in 2016 and 15.8% in 2017. However, the trade balance will remain \nnegative because of a high import bill and weak external demand. \nAssuming careful debt management and limited volatility in foreign \nin\ufb02ows, gross reserves are projected to stay at $2.5 billion in 2016 before \nrising to $2.6\u00a0billion in 2017 (Figure 3.3.9). \n\nThe forecast above is subject to downside risks.

International assessments \nhave highlighted Georgia\u2019s need to improve R&D and education. \nGeorgia\u00a0ranked 101 out of 140 economies in the quality of higher \neducation and 128 for university\u2013industry collaboration in the \nGlobal\u00a0Competitiveness Report 2015\u20132016 of the World Economic\u00a0Forum. \nMoreover, education expenditure remains low, at under 3% of GDP, \ndespite high enrollment. Low spending constrains educational \nattainment, hampering efforts to develop a workforce with the skills \nneeded for a dynamic economy. Besides gradually raising education \nexpenditure, the government plans to prioritize job growth and increase \ninvestment in R&D. Doing so would raise productivity while making \ngrowth more inclusive.\n\nTo narrow rural\u2013urban disparities, the government has adopted a \nmore proactive strategy to promote rural growth through investment \nin agriculture and to make reform more inclusive by targeting \nsmallholder farmers and industrial startups with concessional funds. \nSpecialized agencies have been created to facilitate exports and upgrade \nentrepreneurial skills, bolster production capacity through job creation, \nsupport innovation and technology transfer, and promote the application \nof new technologies in business to help commercialize innovative R&D \nfor a knowledge-based economy. \n\nTo strengthen governance, quality assurance, and \ufb01nance for \nprofessional education, the government has established a framework \nfor professional competence in line with market trends and demand \nfor professional quali\ufb01cations. To smooth the transition from training \nto work, it has strengthened employment policies and introduced an \nintegrated information portal for labor market management that helps \nidentify mismatches between employable skills and available labor, \nthereby helping educational institutions expand training for professions \nin greater demand.\n\nA shrinking and aging population limits the size of the workforce, \nconstraining growth. Providing education and training to enhance older \nworkers\u2019 facility with information technology and communications \ncould help. The government\u2019s new Solidarity Fund encourages voluntary \ncontributions to aid older people, particularly those in need. \n\nProductivity could be further enhanced by improving efficiency in \n\nboth rural and urban areas. The government\u2019s development strategy \nhelps enterprises and farmers with innovative \ufb01nancial products that \ninclude preferential credit and leasing programs. \n\nContinued productivity improvements will depend on structural, \n\npolicy, and institutional reforms to encourage investment in export-\noriented activities. Government initiatives in these areas would help \naccelerate productivity growth and harness the potential of the \nexport\u00a0sector.\n\n3.3.8\u2002Current account components\n\nExports\nImports\nNet services\nNet income\nCurrent transfers\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n\u20137\n\n\u201314\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of Georgia. https://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 3 March 2016); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.3.9\u2002Gross international reserves\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of Georgia. https://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 3 March 2016); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n$ billion\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n$ billion\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\fKazakhstan\n\nContinued weak oil prices slashed growth and pushed the current account into deficit for the first \ntime  since  2009.

Policy  must  address  financial  vulnerabilities  that \nstem  from  low  oil  prices,  persistent  problems  with  nonperforming  loans,  and  further  dollarization.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth slowed sharply to 1.0% from 4.3% in 2014 on low prices for \noil, the economy\u2019s main export. On the supply side, data for the \ufb01rst 9 \nmonths show that industry contracted by 0.6%, reversing 0.1% growth \nduring the same period in 2014, as utilities and mining declined. \nAgriculture expanded by 2.9%, doubling from 1.4% in the same \nperiod in 2014 on increases of 5.6% for crops and 3.2% for livestock. \nGrowth\u00a0in services slowed to 2.4% from 5.8% a year earlier because of \nlower\u00a0growth in trade, transport, and real estate. \n\nOn the demand side, during the \ufb01rst 9 months of 2015 consumption \n\nexpanded by 2.8%, slightly above the 2.5% recorded during the \nsame period of 2014 (Figure 3.4.1). This re\ufb02ected a jump in private \nconsumption in the \ufb01rst half, as consumers rushed to buy imported \ngoods in anticipation of a sharply lower Kazakh tenge, which came in \nAugust as the authorities abruptly abandoned an exchange rate band for \na \ufb02oating rate. Growth in public consumption in the \ufb01rst 9 months of \n2015 slowed to 2.5% from 11.2% a year earlier, as lower oil-based revenue \nrestrained expansion of current expenditure. Expansion of investment, \nhowever, rose to 5.0% from 0.2%, as higher public investment more than \noffset a slowing in private investment associated with lower oil prices. \nNet exports fell by 1.5%, versus a 7.5% increase in the same period of \n2014, as exports fell more than imports (8.2% versus 6.7%).\n\nAverage annual in\ufb02ation eased to 6.6% from 6.7% in 2014. However, \n\nsharp depreciation of the tenge fueled in\ufb02ation in the last quarter of \nthe year, driving the 12 month in\ufb02ation rate December over December \nto 13.6% from 7.4% in 2014. Goods other than food, mainly imports, \nwere the primary source of in\ufb02ation, rising by 8.2% over the year, as \nprice controls for utilities and some food items constrained other price \nincreases (Figure 3.4.2). \n\nLower revenue attributable to weak oil prices forced cuts in \nplanned spending, as the republican budget de\ufb01cit narrowed to 2.2% \nof GDP from 2.7% in 2014.

The budget was \namended several times during 2015 in light of the plunge in oil prices, \ncombining cuts in certain spending categories with countercyclical \ngovernment programs that included a post-devaluation pay rise, \nhigher pensions and social transfers, price adjustments for government \nprograms, and preparations for Expo 2017. Total expenditure was 16.3% \nof GDP, up from 15.9% in 2014 (Figure 3.4.3). \n\nMonetary policy during 2015 tried to strike a balance between \nstemming the decline in growth attributable to low oil prices and \ncurbing the in\ufb02ation that followed the adoption of a \ufb02oating exchange \nrate and the resulting plunge in the value of the currency. On 19 August \n2015, Kazakhstan announced a move from a tightly managed exchange \nrate band of T155\u2013T188 per $1 to a \ufb02oating rate regime. This triggered \nan immediate plunge to T252 per $1 and a subsequent depreciation to \nT340 by the end of the year, despite an effort to stem the decline that \ncontributed to a net reduction of $1.2 billion in international reserves \nfrom August to December (Figure 3.4.4). To contain in\ufb02ation, the \nNational Bank of Kazakhstan, the central bank, introduced a base \ninterest rate of 12% on 2 September 2015 and raised it to 16% a month \nlater and to 17% in February 2016. However, extensive dollarization, \nwith more than 65% of bank deposits in foreign currency, limits the \neffectiveness of monetary policy (Figure 3.4.5). The growth of broad \nmoney tripled to 34.3% from 10.5% in 2014, in part because currency \ndepreciation raised the domestic currency value of foreign exchange \ndeposits. Local currency deposits grew by only 7.9%. Nonperforming \nloans (NPLs) remain a signi\ufb01cant issue facing banks, though the ratio of \nNPLs to all loans was reined in to below 10% by the end of 2015.\n\nFor the \ufb01rst time since 2009, Kazakhstan\u2019s current account turned \n\nnegative in 2015, with an estimated de\ufb01cit equal to 2.8% of GDP \nfollowing a surplus of 2.6% in 2014. Exports plunged by 42.4%, far more \nthan the 6.2% decline in 2014. This largely re\ufb02ected low oil prices, \nwhich fell still further in the last quarter of the year, but slow growth \nin trading partners hurt other exports as well. Imports fell by 22.9%, \nmore than the 14.2% drop in 2014, as slow growth and the sharp rise in \ndomestic prices for imported consumer goods curbed demand. Imports \nof services fell by 8.5%, versus an increase by 5.8% in 2014, as demand \nfrom mining and related activities decreased. However, the de\ufb01cit in the \nincome account narrowed by 50.6% as foreign investors\u2019 earnings from \noil exports declined sharply. The year saw the assets of the National \nFund for the Republic of Kazakhstan fall by 13.3%, and international \nreserves by 4.6% (Figure 3.4.6). \n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is forecast to remain subdued at 0.7% in 2016 and 1.0% in 2017. \nHigher countercyclical expenditure, the Expo 2017 in Astana, and the \nanticipated entry into production of the long-delayed Kashagan oil\ufb01eld \nmitigate the prospective drop in private consumption.

With depreciation raising the competitiveness \nof agricultural\u00a0exports and reducing demand for imported food, \nagricultural production can expect to grow by 3.0% in both 2016 and \n2017. Services, the driver of economic growth during the past 5 years, \nare projected to grow by only 0.9% in 2016 and contract by 1.0% in 2017, \nas the slump in trade from declining domestic demand offsets expected \ngrowth in transport. \n\nOn the demand side, private consumption should contract by 4.0% \nin 2016 and another 3.7% in 2017 in response to high prices, particularly \nfor imports. Public consumption is forecast to grow by 4.0% in 2016 and \n5.0% in 2017, re\ufb02ecting higher general service outlays to prepare for \nExpo 2017 and the implementation of countercyclical projects. Together, \npublic and private investment are projected to expand by 7.3% in 2016 \nand 6.1% in 2017 as public projects are used to offset sluggish private \ninvestment in extractive industries and low growth elsewhere in the \neconomy. Net export volumes are forecast to rise by 2.0% in 2016 and \n5.0% in 2017 as volumes of mostly commodity exports contract less than \nimports, which are mainly price-sensitive consumer goods. In 2017, \na\u00a0rise in oil production attributable to the Kashagan oil\ufb01eld should also \nboost exports. \n\nAverage annual in\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate to 12.6% in 2016, \nre\ufb02ecting the impact of currency depreciation and a low base during the \n\ufb01rst 3 quarters of 2015, and then slow to 4.6% in 2017 as higher interest \nrates, weak domestic demand, and price controls restrain further \nincreases. Imports other than food are expected to remain the main \nsource of in\ufb02ation. \n\nOver the next 2 years, \ufb01scal policy is expected to support growth. \nThe republican budget is projected to record a de\ufb01cit equal to 1.8% of \nGDP in 2016 and 1.2% in 2017, after accounting for expected income \ntransfers of 8.1% of GDP in 2016 and 8.0% in 2017 from the National \nFund for the Republic of Kazakhstan. Tax receipts are projected to \ndecline from the equivalent of 8.0% of GDP in 2015 to 6.9% in 2016, and \nthen rebound to 7.4% in 2017 as higher prices add to value-added tax \ncollections (though revenue may suffer from possible corporate tax rate \ncuts). Expenditure is forecast equaling 16.9% of GDP in 2016 and 18.0% \nin 2017 with planned outlays for countercyclical projects and Expo 2017 \npreparations. Total public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected \nto rise from 17.4% of GDP in 2015 to 17.8% in 2016 and 19.9% in 2017 \nwith projected borrowing from multilateral development banks and the \nimpact of tenge depreciation on external public debt.\n\nOver the next 2 years, monetary policy is expected to focus on \ncontaining in\ufb02ation, though high dollarization and a shallow \ufb01nancial \nsystem will limit its effectiveness.

Exports are projected to decline by 24.5% \nin 2016 and then rise by 10.4% in 2017 as international oil prices \nrecover somewhat and the Kashagan oil\ufb01eld starts producing in 2017. \nImports\u00a0are expected to fall by 23.3% in 2016 and, with some increase in \nimports for Expo 2017, rise by 3.5% in that year. Trade in services should \nrecord a de\ufb01cit equal to 2.6% of GDP 2016 and 3.2% in 2017 because \nof some substitution of domestic for imported services to avoid higher \ncosts from tenge depreciation. The de\ufb01cit in the income account should \nmove in line with oil price developments. \n\nPublic and publicly guaranteed external debt is projected to rise \nslightly, from the equivalent of 10.3% of GDP at the end of 2015 and 2016 \nto 10.6% at the end of 2017, re\ufb02ecting planned loans from multilateral \ndevelopment banks and the impact of depreciation. Total external debt \nis expected to increase from 84.6% of GDP at the end of 2015 to well \nabove 100.0% at the end of 2016.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening  \na weak \ufb01nancial system\nThe sudden move to a \ufb02oating exchange rate from a tightly managed \nband revealed \ufb01nancial vulnerabilities that stem not only from \npersistently high NPLs but also from high and growing dollarization \nand much lower oil prices. Since the global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009, \nold and new NPLs attributable to construction and real estate have \ninhibited private sector lending, with NPLs reaching 37.6% of total \nlending in 2012. By 1 January 2016, NPLs had fallen to 8.0%, meeting \na central bank target of less than 10% after it took on some NPLs and \neased writing them off. Besides NPLs, the country also suffers from a \nhighly concentrated \ufb01nancial sector in which banks held more than half \nof sector assets at the end of 2015, and the top \ufb01ve banks held nearly \n60% of all banking assets.\n\nCurrency depreciation has further increased the cost in tenge of \nforeign currency borrowing, undercut bank capitalization, worsened \nthe risk of borrower default, and consequently hurt the market value \nof banks\u2019 equity and deterred their lending. Depreciation has greatly \nincreased the tenge value of private external debt, which totaled \n$8.6 billion for banks and $54.2 billion for other private \ufb01rms at the \nend of September 2015. In addition, re\ufb01nancing has become difficult. \nPossibilities for foreign re\ufb01nancing suffered from a downgrade in the \ncountry\u2019s sovereign credit rating to BBB\u2013, the lowest investment grade. \nMoreover, a 17% central bank policy rate and shallow interbank and \nbond markets make domestic re\ufb01nancing very costly. As a result, there \nhas been no new lending in real terms. Loans as a percentage of GDP \nhardly changed during 2014 and 2015 (Figure 3.4.9).

The government helped reduce NPLs by \nintroducing the prudential requirement that NPLs cannot exceed 10% \nof all loans, legal amendments to facilitate writing off NPLs, and special \npurpose vehicles to shift NPLs from bank balance sheets to the central \nbank. In 2015, the capital adequacy ratio was raised slightly. All banks \nmust now measure credit risk by external ratings, while market risk and \noperational risks are assigned by set formulas. \n\nBeyond these measures, the \ufb01nancial system requires considerable \n\nsupport. To provide it, the central bank needs credibility, autonomy, \nand the resources to \ufb01ll this role, especially as high dollarization \nhinders its ability to serve as a lender of last resort in foreign currency. \nAs of 1 January 2016, four of the country\u2019s 35 banks failed to comply \nwith central bank prudential requirements. Banks may still overstate \nNPL provisions, which are based partly on collateral that has not been \nrevalued since 2008. Moreover, most banks serve only small customer \nbases, and the loan portfolios of the smaller banks in particular are \nconcentrated in a few sectors. As a result, the banking system suffers \nfrom highly concentrated lending, with individual banks\u2019 exposure to \ntheir single largest borrower averaging 19.6% in January 2016. This is \nworryingly close to the 25% prudential norm in Kazakhstan, which is \nhigher than in some other countries. \n\nFurther, the banks\u2019 net open foreign exchange positions (foreign \nexchange liabilities exceeding assets) rose dramatically during 2015 \n(Figure 3.4.10), and prudential requirements current in 2014 were \nrelaxed for 2015 but not for 2016. Recapitalizing much of the banking \nsystem, both in tenge and foreign currency, might become necessary as \nrisk-weighted provisions against unhedged foreign currency loans to \ncorporations are often inadequate. \n\nTo stabilize the banking system, the government plans as medium-\nterm measures to further develop noncash payments, reduce turnover \nin lightly regulated shadow banks, and ban foreign currency pricing. \nTo\u00a0achieve stability in the long run, the government will try to \naccelerate economic diversi\ufb01cation and increase the local content of \ngoods and services as far as possible under World Trade Organization \nregulations. In the short run, the size of guaranteed tenge deposits \nwill be doubled from T5 million to T10 million, while interest rates on \nforeign currency deposits will be cut to 3%. The central bank also plans \nto provide more liquidity and continue to implement reforms to improve \nsupervision and comply fully with Basel III requirements. A program \nto consolidate banks could minimize \ufb01scal costs if banks require \nrecapitalization. In addition, reining in dollarization is crucial to make \nboth tenge intermediation and monetary policy more effective.\n\n3.4.10\u2002 Change in banks\u2019 net open \nforeign\u00a0exchange positions\n\nT billion\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n-150\n\n-200\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4 Q1\n2015\n\nQ2 Q3\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fKyrgyz Republic\n\nGrowth  declined  to  3.5%  from  4.0%  in  2014  as  slower  expansion  in  industry  offset  gains  in \nagriculture and services.

By the end of the year, the som had depreciated \nby 28.9% (Figure 3.5.3). The central bank intervened repeatedly \nin\u00a02015 to stabilize the som, at a cost of $261 million. The policy rate \nwas reduced slightly to 10.0% at year-end from 10.5% a year earlier. \nHowever, monetary policy can do little under extensive dollarization, \nand 55.2% of loans and 68.3% of deposits were in foreign currency at the \nend\u00a0of\u00a02015. The average deposit interest rate increased marginally to \n4.95% from 4.84% in 2014, while the average lending rate increased to \n18.61% from 17.58%.

However, the economy remains vulnerable to shocks from \nits largest enterprise, the Kumtor gold mine, where a drop in output \ncut\u00a01% from growth in 2015 and disputed mine ownership could disrupt \nproduction in 2016.\n\nOn the supply side, processing, light industry, and to some extent \n\nconstruction should lift the economy. In addition, accession to the \nEurasian Economic Union (EEU) may boost trade and transportation, \nthough demand in the EEU is weakening and the need to raise tariffs \nto EEU levels may shrink trade with economies outside the union \n(Box 3.5.1). On the demand side, lower remittances may further reduce \nhousehold incomes and private consumption in 2016, though remittances \nshould eventually rise with recovery in the Russian Federation and \nother trade partners.\n\n3.5.1\u2002The impact of economic union\n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic joined the EEU in 2014, and the borders with \nKazakhstan have been open since 12 August\u00a02015.

While\u00a0the country may ultimately bene\ufb01t \nfrom higher trade, more efficient \ufb02ows of labor and capital, and a decline in \nnontariff trade barriers, its average tariffs will likely rise toward the common \nexternal tariff of the EEU.

Interest rates \nwould rise more with further depreciation of the som. \n\nThe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is projected to equal 9.1% of GDP in 2016 and\u00a04.1% \n\nin 2017. The government aims to limit the de\ufb01cit by restraining \nexpenditure. With slow growth, revenue is projected at around 35.0% of \nGDP in 2016 and 2017, while expenditure is forecast at 40.2% or more, \npending cuts. Tax revenue could be higher if EEU accession yields more \ncustoms revenue than now forecast. However, the ratio of public debt \nto GDP will likely increase in 2016, possibly to the brink of high debt \ndistress as de\ufb01ned by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is forecast to remain near 17.0% in \n2016 but ease to 15.0% in 2017 with some improvement in the external \nenvironment (Figure 3.5.7). Exports are forecast to grow by 5%\u20139% \nin both 2016 and 2017, mainly from gains in agricultural products \nand textiles. However, weaker consumer demand in 2016 in the EEU \ncould worsen the trade outlook. The government, using $1 billion from \nthe Russian Kyrgyz Development Fund, is working to restructure the \neconomy by supporting export-oriented industries and taking other \nmeasures to smooth entry into the EEU. Imports are expected to grow \nby about 5% in both 2016 and 2017 because of planned infrastructure \nprojects. Remittances will likely fall another 10% in 2016 with continued \nrecession in the Russian Federation, where nearly all Kyrgyz migrants \nwork, and possible further ruble depreciation. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014achieving \ufb01scal and debt \nsustainability\nThe public debt situation worsened notably in 2015 as further sharp \ndepreciation of the som raised the ratio of external public debt to GDP \nto an estimated 63.8% by year-end, well above the current legal ceiling \nof\u00a060.0% (Figure 3.5.8). Moreover, slowing growth, rising in\ufb02ation, and \nreserve depletion threaten to exacerbate the debt problem.\n\nAlthough the government has introduced amendments to raise \nthe public debt ceiling, its goal is to bring the ratio of debt to GDP \nbelow 65% in the medium term. Reducing the debt ratio will require \nprioritizing and rescheduling public investment, cutting the wage bill \nand other spending, and better managing debt. \n\nBesides these measures, greater care when contracting and \nguaranteeing new debt would require a moratorium on commercial \nborrowing and improved debt monitoring to minimize risks from \npublic\u00a0enterprises.\n\nFiscal consolidation is essential to restore debt sustainability \nwhile funding programs that address poverty and boost growth. \n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n0\n\n\u20137\n\n\u201314\n\n\u201321\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. http://www.stat.kg (accessed 3 March 2016); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.5.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2016\n\n\u2002\u20021.0\n\n\u200210.0\n\n\u201317.0\n\n2017\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u2002\u20028.0\n\n\u201315.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.5.7\u2002Current account balance\n \n\n% of GDP\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 3 March 2016); \nADB\u00a0estimates. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nKyrgyz Republic\u2002\u2002109\n\n3.5.8\u2002Public debt \n\nPublic debt\nFiscal de\ufb01cit\n\n% of GDP\n\n75\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 3 March 2016); \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nThe\u00a0government is developing measures\u2014held back in 2015 because \nof parliamentary elections\u2014for \ufb01scal consolidation in 2016, to be \naccelerated in 2017 and 2018.\n\n Tax revenue should be raised by improving tax administration and \n\nwidening the tax base by removing exemptions and simplifying tax \nprocedures. On the revenue side, the government plans to (i) strengthen \nthe administration of value-added taxes, (ii) let exemptions expire on \nschedule while eliminating other exemptions and avoiding new ones, \n(iii) raise excise rates on alcohol and tobacco, (iv) introduce stamp duties \non some domestic goods, and (v) enact a luxury tax on high-value real \nestate. On the expenditure side, it plans to (i) refrain from ad hoc wage \nincreases and prepare a plan to gradually reduce the wage bill to 8% \nof GDP by 2018, (ii) streamline purchases of goods and services while \nkeeping outlays at the 2015 level in som terms, (iii) rationalize and better \ntarget existing subsidies, (iv) review electricity tariffs to ensure sector \nsustainability, (v) reduce duplication in social bene\ufb01ts and improve their \ntargeting, and (vi) keep domestically \ufb01nanced public investment below \n3% of GDP. \n\n If these measures are implemented, public and publicly guaranteed \n\ndebt is projected to peak at 66% of GDP in 2017, then fall below 65% \nby 2018. However, as the risks to debt sustainability remain high, it is \ncritical to improve debt management and mobilize domestic sources \nof \ufb01nancing. Measures to stimulate growth include using the Russian \nKyrgyz Development Fund to support export-oriented industries and \nimproving the business environment to attract investments.\n\n\fTajikistan\n\nReported  growth  slowed  to  6.0%  and  trade  declined,  reflecting  lower  commodity  prices,  weak \nprivate  investment,  and  remittance  shortfalls.  Growth  is  projected  to  fall  to  3.8%  in  2016  as \nrecession continues in the Russian Federation and activity remains weak in other trading partners, \nthen recover slightly to 4.0% in 2017. A better business environment would boost local production \nand  employment,  alleviating  excessive  dependence  on  remittances.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth decelerated to 6.0% in 2015 from 6.7% a year earlier as \nrecession in the Russian Federation and a plunge in the ruble caused \nremittances, Tajikistan\u2019s main source of income, to fall by a third \n(Figure 3.6.1). About\u00a0135,000 Tajik migrant workers returned home as \na result of tightened immigration control in the Russian Federation. \nOther\u00a0constraints on growth were lower prices for primary Tajik \nexports aluminum and cotton, weak private investment, and the \ndepreciation of the Tajik somoni by nearly a third. \n\nOn the supply side, a 21.2% rise in construction fueled by public \ninvestment was the main driver, offsetting a 7.0% decline in services \ndue mainly to the drop in remittances (Figure 3.6.2). Growth in \nindustry slowed to 11.2% from 13.3% in 2014 despite signi\ufb01cant gains in \nelectricity generation and mining. Growth in agriculture slowed to 3.2% \nfrom 4.5% in 2014 as late spring frosts reduced exports of dried fruit. \nOn the demand side, low remittances and currency depreciation \nconstrained private consumption. Higher investment from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) partly offset lower private consumption.\n\nIn\ufb02ation slowed, despite the depreciation, to 5.1% from 6.1% in \n2014, re\ufb02ecting the drop in private consumption, lower global prices for \npetroleum and wheat, and currency depreciation in Tajikistan\u2019s main \ntrade partners. Prices rose by 4.3% for food, 7.8% for other goods, and \n2.3% for services.\n\nFiscal policy was generally expansionary over the year, though \nlower private consumption and a 20% drop in imports constrained \ntax revenue. In response, the government deferred a salary increase \nbut maintained social spending. Despite the slowdown, total revenue \nincluding grants rose from the equivalent of 28.4% of GDP in 2014 to \nan estimated 30.1%, re\ufb02ecting better tax administration (Figure 3.6.3). \nExpenditure also rose, to 32.4% from 29.0% in 2014, as capital spending \nwas expanded to maintain economic activity. The overall budget de\ufb01cit \nreached 2.3% of GDP. Public and publicly guaranteed debt (all external) \nrose to 27.8% of GDP at the end of 2015 from 22.7% a year earlier as the \nsomoni depreciated.\n\nThis chapter was written by Muhammadi Boboev of the Tajikistan Resident Mission, ADB, \nDushanbe.\n\nRuble/$\n\n0.025\n\n0.020\n\n0.015\n\n0.010\n\n0.005\n\n0.000\n\n3.6.1\u2002Remittances and exchange rate\n\nRemittances\n\nExchange rate\n\n \n% change\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201330\n\n\u201340\n\n\u201350\n\n%\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201330\n\nJan\n2015\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct Dec\n\nNote: Remittances fell by 33.3% in 2015 as the ruble \ndepreciated by 27% against the dollar.\nSources: National Bank of Tajikistan; Bloomberg.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.2\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nConstruction\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n7.4\n\n7.5\n\n7.4\n\n6.7\n\n6.0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: Tajikistan State Statistical Agency.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nTajikistan\u2002\u2002111\n\nMonetary policy aimed to ensure macroeconomic stability and \n\n3.6.3\u2002Fiscal balance and public debt\n\nrein in in\ufb02ation. To facilitate lending, reserve requirements were \ncut for \ufb01nancial institutions that met capital adequacy standards: \nby 0.5 percentage points to 1.5% for local currency deposits, and by \n1.0\u00a0percentage point to 7.0% for foreign. In response, broad money grew \nby 18.7% during the year, up from 7.1% in 2014 (Figure 3.6.4). At\u00a0the \nsame time, the National Bank of Tajikistan, the central bank, used \nopen market operations to reduce liquidity. In March 2016, it raised the \nre\ufb01nancing rate by 1.0 percentage point to 9.0% to dampen in\ufb02ation. \nDepreciation intensi\ufb01ed \ufb01nancial sector problems because of \n\nextensive dollarization. Nonperforming loans reached 30%, while average \nbank capital fell to 12% of assets. Efforts to consolidate micro\ufb01nance \norganizations by raising their minimum capital requirements induced \nsome to merge or close when their licenses were withdrawn. \n\nLower remittances and export receipts, along with currency \n\ndepreciation in Tajikistan\u2019s main trade partners, caused the somoni to \ndepreciate, despite sizable interventions to stabilize exchange rates, \nby 31.7% against the dollar and 16.1% against the ruble (Figure 3.6.5). \nAt\u00a0the end of 2015, reserves totaled $494.3 million, covering only about \n1.6\u00a0months of imports, which is well below prudential norms and \nconstrains the central bank\u2019s ability to defend the currency against any \nfurther depreciation (Figure 3.6.6).\n\nTo ease currency pressures, foreign exchange control was \n\nstrengthened. In April 2015, the operations of private exchange offices \nwere brought under the control of banks. In September, the central bank \nsigned a $500 million currency swap agreement with its counterpart in \nthe PRC. In December, authorization for foreign exchange operations \nwas restricted to \ufb01nancial institutions. In February 2016, the central \nbank sought to shield the currency from ruble \ufb02uctuation by asking all \n\ufb01nancial institutions to convert incoming ruble remittances into somoni. \nThe current account de\ufb01cit narrowed from the equivalent of 9.1% \nof GDP in 2014 to an estimated 5.9% despite the plunge in remittances. \nExports fell by 8.9%, mainly because of weak demand and lower world \nprices for the country\u2019s main exports, while imports dropped by 20.1% \ndue to lower private consumption. External debt equaled 27.8% of GDP \nat the end of 2015, mainly because of depreciation.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is forecast to slow to 3.8% in 2016, re\ufb02ecting the continuing \nrecession in the Russian Federation, before recovering to 4.0% in 2017 \nwith some recovery in the external outlook. Second-round effects \nof developments in 2015, along with weaker economic performance \nin Tajikistan\u2019s other main trade partners (the PRC, Kazakhstan, \nand Turkey) and continued low global commodity prices, will limit \nremittances and foreign investment, constraining demand and \nconsumption in 2016. Expected recovery in the Russian Federation and \nbetter performance in other regional partners in 2017 should improve \ngrowth prospects. \n\nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to grow moderately in 2016 \nas construction picks up and to accelerate in 2017 on increases in mining \n\nDomestic debt\nPublic and publicly guaranteed external debt\nExpenditures\nRevenue and grants\nFiscal balance including the public investment program\n\n \n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n2.3\n\n5.0\n\n3.9\n\n5.0\n\n5.4\n\n33.1\n\n28.6\n\n25.3\n\n22.7\n\n27.8\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSources: National Bank of Tajikistan; Tajikistan State \nStatistical Agency.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.4\u2002Monetary indicators\n\nCredit to the private sector\nBroad money\nReserve money\nRe\ufb01nancing rate (period average)\n\n \n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSources: National Bank of Tajikistan; International \nMonetary Fund.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.5\u2002Exchange rates\n\nSomonis to the US dollar\n\nSomonis to the ruble\n\nTJS/$ \n\nTJS/ruble\n\n0.03\n\n0.06\n\n0.09\n\n0.12\n\n0.15\n\nJan\n2015\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nMar\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: National Bank of Tajikistan.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fIn\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate to 8.5% in 2016 and slow to 7.5% \n\n3.6.6\u2002Gross international reserves\n\nAmount\n\nImport cover\n\n$ million\n\nMonths of imports\n\n112\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nand processing, as well as the opening of Tajikistan\u2019s segment of a \nregional high-voltage power line and a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan \nto the PRC. Agriculture should grow modestly as repatriating migrants \nreturn to their farms. However, services are projected to contract \nfurther as weak remittances hold down household income. \n\nOn the demand side, weak remittances, low foreign exchange \nearnings, and likely continued depreciation of the currency will limit \ngains in private consumption and investment, though a possible hike \nin civil service salaries during 2016 would support consumption. \nWith\u00a0private investment shrinking, the government is likely to expand \npublic investment. \n\nin 2017, re\ufb02ecting the lagged effect on import prices of depreciation \nin 2015 and somewhat less depreciation in 2016 (Figure 3.6.7). \nWeak\u00a0demand should limit price hikes in services. Higher in\ufb02ation \ncould result if foreign exchange restrictions are further tightened, or \nif\u00a0depreciation exceeds expectations. \n\nFiscal policy is expected to be expansionary over the next 2 years \n\ngiven the challenges facing the economy. The budget is projected to \nrecord de\ufb01cits equal to 2.5% of GDP in 2016 and 1.5% in 2017, but \nde\ufb01cits could be higher with further depreciation or pressure to clear \narrears at public enterprises. The projected growth slowdown is \nexpected to limit revenues despite ongoing reform to tax administration. \nRevenue is forecast equal to 29.0% of GDP in 2016 and 30.5% in 2017. \nTotal\u00a0expenditure is forecast at 31.5% of GDP in 2016 and 32.0% in 2017, \nwith increases for capital investment but not current outlays. Higher \npublic investment should raise public debt above 35% of GDP.\n\nMonetary policy will likely aim to curb in\ufb02ation while preventing \nrecession. Broad money growth will rise mainly as foreign exchange \ndeposits gain value in local currency terms. Exchange rate policy is \nexpected to move gradually to a \ufb02oating rate regime because of limited \nreserves. Banks face serious risks from ongoing depreciation, tightened \nforeign exchange regulations, and stagnant retail trade and services. \nThe current account de\ufb01cit is forecast to narrow to 4.8% of GDP \n\nin 2016 and then widen to 5.5% in 2017 (Figure 3.6.8). Exports are \nprojected to rise by 5% in 2016 and 7% in 2017 as depreciation boosts \ncompetitiveness. Imports are expected to contract by 7% in 2016 in \ntandem with lower demand before rising by 5% in 2017 with higher \ncapital spending and some growth in remittances with recovery in the \nRussian Federation.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014developing a new growth model\nTajikistan is highly vulnerable to external shocks, particularly from \ncommodity prices and remittances (Figure 3.6.9). Output and exports \nare constrained by limited production and low value added. This leaves \nremittance-\ufb01nanced consumption as the main source of growth. \n\nTajikistan needs a new growth model based more on domestic \nproduction and exports. Research suggests that the economy\u2019s potential \ngrowth rate has fallen by 2 percentage points since 2007, raising \nconcerns about growth prospects over the medium to long term. \n\n3.6.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n\u20023.8\n\n\u20028.5\n\n\u20134.8\n\n\u20024.0\n\n\u20027.5\n\n\u20135.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n2.0\n\n1.6\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\nQ4\n2013\n\nQ2\n2014\n\nQ4\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n2015\n\nSource: National Bank of Tajikistan.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.7\u2002Inflation\n\n750\n\n600\n\n450\n\n300\n\n150\n\n0\n\n%\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Tajikistan State Statistical Agency; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nTajikistan\u2002\u2002113\n\nIn the short run, a few measures would make private investment \n\n3.6.9\u2002Remittances and GDP growth\n\nWhile\u00a0stimulating demand may help in the short run, sustained growth \nwill require supply-side reform to revive the country\u2019s industrial base \nand boost employment. \n\nThe government is considering a number of measures in its \nNational\u00a0Development Strategy to 2030 to boost economic activity: \nsecuring stable access to energy resources, attaining self-sufficiency \nin food production, integrating international and national transport \nlinks, developing communication networks, and broadening access to \nsocial\u00a0services.\n\nFurther, Tajikistan would do well to address important obstacles \nfacing businesses. According to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2016 \nreport, Tajikistan ranks exceptionally poorly on getting electricity, \nat 177\u00a0out of 189 economies surveyed; taxation at 172; and getting \nconstruction permits at 152. Moreover, the complexity of tax regulation \nis the second highest concern among \ufb01rms in Tajikistan, according to \nthe Global\u00a0Competitiveness Report 2015\u20132016 of the World Economic \nForum. During\u00a0the past year, many \ufb01rms have been pressured to make \nadvance tax payments. Tight foreign exchange controls have further \ncomplicated doing business. \n\nmore attractive: adopting more stable and transparent investment \nincentives; reducing the number of surprise business inspections, in \npart by halving the number of government units conducting them; \nlimiting advance tax payments to 3 months\u2019 worth of annual liabilities; \nstreamlining the granting of construction permits; and simplifying \nregulations on certifying product quality, toward boosting exports. \nOver the medium term, a sequenced approach to growth should \n\nstart small in carefully selected locales. Private investment should \nbe encouraged to improve identi\ufb01ed urban growth nodes, value \nchains in priority areas, and connections with external markets. \nThis approach would build on the four special zones the government \nhas created to increase exports, which otherwise risk becoming \nenclaves because of weak links with the local economy.

Growth  is  forecast  to \nremain  at  6.5%  in  2016  on  reduced  energy  earnings,  then  recover  to  7.0%  in  2017  with  expected \nhigher  petroleum  prices.  Diversifying  the  highly  concentrated  export  sector  would  help  smooth \noutput  volatility  and  create  jobs  to  absorb  a  young  and  growing  working-age  population.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe government reported growth at 6.5% in 2015, down from 10.3% a \nyear earlier (Figure 3.7.1). The slowdown re\ufb02ected declines in energy \nprices, but growth found support from investments in social and \nindustrial development, which picked up to 7.8% from 6.7% in 2014. \n\nOn the supply side, slower growth in hydrocarbons cut expansion in \n\nindustry to 3.1% from 11.4% in 2014. Growth in agriculture accelerated \nto 7.9% from 4.2% a year earlier, re\ufb02ecting good harvests of wheat \nand cotton and increased livestock farming. Expansion in services \ndiminished slightly, to 10.0% from 10.6% in 2014, mainly due to slower \ngrowth in services related to construction.\n\nAverage annual in\ufb02ation is estimated to have held steady at 6.0% \n(Figure 3.7.1). Despite the 19% devaluation of the Turkmen manat at the \nbeginning of the 2015, prices for food and services stabilized during \nthe second half with price controls, state subsidies, and the absence \nof further depreciation. The government\u2019s import-substitution policy \ncontributed by helping to \ufb01ll the market with less expensive locally \nproduced food and household goods. Broad money growth slowed to \n8.4% from 11.4% in 2014. However, growth in private credit is estimated \nto have risen to 30.0% from 20.9% in 2014, re\ufb02ecting mainly import \nsubstitution and construction by small and medium-sized enterprises. \n\nThe government budget is estimated to have moved from a \n\nsurplus equal to 0.8% of GDP in 2014 to a de\ufb01cit of 1.0% (Figure 3.7.2). \nThis\u00a0re\ufb02ects continued spending on social programs, including a 10% \nrise in public wages, pensions, and students\u2019 stipends, along with higher \ninvestment outlays. Lower hydrocarbon exports limited revenues, but \nthe government\u2019s Stabilization Fund helped smooth revenue volatility. \nAs in past years, energy revenues largely covered the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit in \nthe non-hydrocarbon economy, estimated at 10.3% of GDP in 2015. \nPublic\u00a0debt rose slightly, to 18.7% of GDP from 16.8% in 2014. \n\nLower prices and slack demand for energy products\u2014especially \n\nnatural gas, Turkmenistan\u2019s main export\u2014sharply reduced export \nearnings.

Foreign direct investment, \nmainly in hydrocarbons and construction, rose slightly to 9.6% of GDP. \nExternal debt, all of it public, stayed below 20% of GDP, while foreign \nexchange reserves were estimated at 30 months of import cover at the \nend of 2015.\n\nEconomic prospects \nThe economy relies heavily on oil and gas exports, the earnings from \nwhich are envisioned to remain weak with lower prices. This may \nprompt the government to cut spending, but a low public debt ratio \nand considerable \ufb01scal reserves allow it to adjust gradually and sustain \ngrowth through social spending and public investment that support the \nnon-hydrocarbon economy. \n\nGrowth is projected steady at 6.5% in 2016, rising to 7.0% in 2017. \nHowever, it could be lower if external weakness persists, requiring the \ngovernment to implement more stringent \ufb01scal adjustment. \n\nTo limit in\ufb02ation, the government will continue import-substitution \n\npolicies and price controls. In\ufb02ation is nevertheless projected rising \nto 6.6% in 2016 before returning to 6.0% in 2017, assuming no further \nmanat depreciation. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan will likely \ntighten monetary policy by restraining credit expansion. Broad money \ngrowth is expected to slow further to 7.2% in 2016.\n\nThe state budget for 2016 projects a de\ufb01cit equal to 1.2% of GDP. \nThe\u00a0Stabilization Fund will continue to support domestic development \nprojects to build social and industrial infrastructure. With lower natural \ngas prices, export earnings should diminish further in 2016, widening \nthe current account de\ufb01cit to 12.3% of GDP. A modest recovery in global \nenergy prices in 2017 is expected to narrow the current account de\ufb01cit \nto 10.0% of GDP. Foreign direct investment will likely remain strong in \nboth years.

While \ufb01scal measures \ncan offset external shocks over the near term using savings accumulated \nin sovereign wealth funds, a prolonged period of low energy prices \ncould diminish these buffers.

The\u00a0priority \nsectors\u2014oil and gas, electric power, chemicals, construction, transport \nand communications, light industry, food processing, textiles, and \nagribusiness\u2014received targets and government allocations with the aim \nof boosting growth in the non-hydrocarbon economy and in hydrocarbon \nprocessing. Heavy public investment and strong foreign direct investment \n(Figure 3.7.5) support the government\u2019s industrial policy with gross \ninvestment that in 2015 equaled 36.6% of GDP. \n\nAs the share of processing in all industry rose from 29% in 2012 \n\nto a provisional 42% in 2015, diversi\ufb01cation has been most evident in \nhydrocarbons, and a dynamic tradable sector beyond hydrocarbons \nhas yet to emerge. Gaining more from diversi\ufb01cation requires balanced \ninvestment management, with adequate support to manufacturing and \nagriculture in addition to expanding hydrocarbons and services, making \ninvestments more efficient, and deepening structural reforms. \n\nThe magnitude of public investment provides ample opportunity to \nimprove its management. A well-coordinated multiyear investment plan \nshould balance growth in hydrocarbons and the rest of the economy. \nRaising the quality of investment depends on introducing a strong \nmedium-term \ufb01scal framework, careful prioritization, and thorough \nappraisal and selection of investment projects. \n\nAs the capital-intensive hydrocarbon sector employs little labor\u2014only \n1.7% of total employment (Figure 3.7.6)\u2014industrial policy should dedicate \nadequate support to productive sectors outside of hydrocarbons that can \ngenerate export income and employment. Investment in highly productive \nindustrial clusters would strengthen value chains throughout the economy, \ncreate networks of local suppliers, and expand the employment potential \nof the export sector. Industrializing agriculture, which provides 43% \nof all employment, by developing agribusiness and adopting advanced \ntechnology would likely boost its productivity and add value to its products. \nProductivity can be further enhanced, and more jobs created, by developing \na high-quality service sector where large potential exists: transport and \ncommunications, logistics, \ufb01nance, trade and marketing, and tourism. \nPolicies should aim to create an environment conducive to private \nsector expansion, encouraging \ufb01rms to develop export markets, upgrade \nworkers\u2019 skills, and promote technology transfer through foreign capital. \nInvestments in education and health would create the human capital \nneeded for structural transformation and improve social development \nin the country, whose current Human Development Index ranking is \n109\u00a0out of 188. Investing in research and development for innovation, and \nproviding local businesses with information and \ufb01nancial support, would \nhelp them acquire the critical mass needed to enter the global market.\nReform to strengthen institutions and governance, the legal and \n\nregulatory framework, and the protection of property rights\u2014and \nto render public \ufb01nance more open and transparent\u2014would enable \nhydrocarbon revenues to be invested more efficiently and productively, \nthereby furthering diversi\ufb01cation.\n\n3.7.5\u2002Foreign direct investment\n\n% of GDP\n\nAmount\n\n$ billion\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n%\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSources: United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment. 2015.

Growth was expected to be lower because \nof a slowdown in the Russian Federation, Uzbekistan\u2019s largest trade \npartner and source of remittances. This slowdown has profoundly \naffected Uzbekistan in two ways: It reduced bilateral trade and \nremittances, thereby diminishing foreign exchange revenues and private \nconsumption, and it accelerated the depreciation of the Uzbek sum \nagainst the US dollar. In response, the government tightened import \ncontrols while expanding public investment and commercial lending to \nsustain domestic demand. \n\n8.0%, down from 8.3% in 2014, and services (including construction) at \n14.0%, down from 15.4%. In industry, public investment boosted output \nin metallurgy, construction materials, and food processing. Export-\noriented machinery and energy\u2014traditional locomotives of industrial \ngrowth\u2014showed little or no expansion despite receiving more than \na quarter of all investment. Public investment also supported robust \nconstruction, which expanded by 17.0%. In services, telecommunications \nexpanded by 15.4% and \ufb01nance by 30.0%, mainly on higher domestic \nlending and sustained demand. Transport, including logistics, \ngrew by 5.1%, down from 8.9% in 2014 in line with weaker external \ntrade.

Despite a 17% rise \nin public sector wages, a massive drop in remittances limited growth \nin private consumption. According to the Central Bank of the Russian \nFederation, in the \ufb01rst 9 months of 2015 (the latest for which data are \navailable), remittances to Uzbekistan sent via money transfer systems \nfell by 59% from the same period in 2014, to $1.8 billion (Figure 3.8.2). \nRecession in the Russian Federation, the sharp depreciation of the ruble, \nand the return of 330,000 Uzbek migrant workers in 2014 and 2015 \nprecipitated the plunge in remittances.\n\nThe government reported in\ufb02ation at 5.6%, well within the target \nrange of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan. The International Monetary \nFund, using the same data but a different methodology, estimated \nin\ufb02ation at 9.3% in the year to September 2015, down from the previous \nyear (Figure 3.8.3). Average annual in\ufb02ation for 2015 is estimated \nat 9.0%. Despite higher public wages and pensions, tariff hikes, and \ncurrency depreciation, in\ufb02ation slowed in 2015, re\ufb02ecting lower global \nfood prices and import costs. In\ufb02ationary pressures came largely from \ngreater depreciation of the sum, which lost 37% of its value against the \nUS dollar on the parallel market in 2015, re\ufb02ecting the depreciation of \nthe ruble against the US dollar and lower global petroleum prices.\nThe central bank continued its policy of steadily lowering \nthe official\u00a0rate of the sum against the US dollar, as the unofficial \nrate fell even faster on the parallel market. Taking into account \nweaker currencies across the Commonwealth of Independent States \n(most\u00a0notably the ruble and Kazakh tenge), the sum is estimated to \nhave appreciated in real terms in 2015, making exports less competitive. \nThe government responded by restricting imports and strengthening \nforeign exchange controls. The gap between official and parallel market \nexchange rates more than doubled in 2015.\n\nThe central bank cut its policy interest rate from 10.0% in 2014 \nto 9.0% while keeping strict control over payment arrears and cash \nin circulation by promoting noncash payments through debit cards. \nBroad\u00a0money growth is estimated to have risen slightly, to 20.7% in 2015 \nfrom 18.0 % a year earlier, in line with expanding domestic credit. \n\nThe augmented budget balance\u2014which includes the surplus of the \nUzbekistan Fund for Reconstruction and Development, the sovereign \nwealth fund\u2014is estimated to have recorded a surplus equivalent to 0.2% \nof GDP for 2015, down from 2.1% a year earlier (Figure 3.8.4). \n\nThe state budget was reported in de\ufb01cit as tax cuts for \ufb01rms \nand individuals and lower international prices for gas, copper, and \ncotton reduced revenues. Early in 2015, the government announced \na new 5-year public investment program to upgrade industry and \ninfrastructure. The $40.8 billion program raised capital spending to an \nestimated 4.7% of GDP from 4.1% in 2014. Total government debt, all of \nit external, rose to 11.0% of GDP from 8.7% in 2014, in line with higher \nforeign borrowing for domestic infrastructure.

On the supply side, investment-led \nindustry will remain the key driver of growth, supported by domestic \nlending.

However, the continued economic slowdown in \nthe Russian Federation and associated losses in remittances will restrain \ngrowth in consumption, at least during 2016. Private consumption is \nforecast to rise by only 1.5% in 2016 but 3.0% in 2017.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast at 10.0% in 2016 and 11.0% in 2017 (Figure 3.8.7). \n\nIn\ufb02ationary pressures will emanate from higher government spending \nand, from 2017, anticipated faster depreciation of the currency. Continued \ndeclines in global prices for food and other imports could partly offset \nthese pressures. Nevertheless, over the medium term, in\ufb02ation will \nremain a key challenge, requiring close coordination of monetary, \nexchange rate, and \ufb01scal policy. \n\nThe government has projected a consolidated budget de\ufb01cit of 1.0% \n\nof GDP in 2016, supporting economic expansion. Including expected \nsovereign wealth fund surpluses, the augmented budget is projected to \npost a surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2016 and 0.3% in 2017. Expenditure is \nforecast to increase in 2016 and 2017 as the government raises health \nand education outlays, along with capital spending. It announced that \nexpenditures for health and education will rise by 16% in 2016 and \ntogether comprise 59% of total budget outlays. \n\nThe current account surplus is forecast to narrow to 0.2% of GDP \nin 2016 before widening to 0.8% in 2017 with some improvement in the \nglobal environment. Falling international prices for the country\u2019s main \nexports, weak global trade, and the deteriorating economic situation in \nthe Russian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of China will reduce \nthe trade surplus and transfers. Merchandise exports are projected to \nrise by 2.0% in 2016 and 4.0% in 2017. \n\nMerchandise imports are projected to rise more gradually, by\u00a02.0% \n\nin 2016 and 2.5% in 2017. Demand will come mostly from public \ninfrastructure spending and the industrial modernization program. \nLower global commodity prices and import controls should limit \nimport\u00a0payments.\n\n3.8.1\u2002 Overview of industrial policy \n\nfor 2015\u20132019\n\nIn March 2015, the government \nadopted an ambitious program \nof structural reform, industrial \nmodernization, and diversi\ufb01cation \nfor 2015\u20132019. The program carries \nforward government industrial \npolicies initiated in 2010 and \nfollows a program for 2011\u20132015. \nIt targets developing high-tech \nindustrial sectors, reducing the \nenergy intensity of production, \nand expanding the production of \n\ufb01nished goods. The\u00a0program has \n846 investment projects totaling \n$40.8 billion for modernization \nand technological renovation, \nincluding $19.6 billion of committed \n\ufb01nancing and $21.2\u00a0billion in \npotential projects. The government \naims to mobilize a rising share of \nforeign investment to \ufb01nance the \nnew program using infrastructure \nsupport, tax exemptions and \npreferences, and other incentives. \nSuccessful implementation of this \nprogram is expected to raise the \nshare of industry in GDP to 27% by \n2020 (from 24% in 2015) and enable \naverage growth of 9% per year in \nindustry during 2015\u20132019.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014improving competitiveness \nthrough innovation\nThe weak global environment and historically low energy prices will \ncontinue to restrain activity in Kazakhstan, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and, along with ongoing trade sanctions, the Russian Federation, \nundermining Uzbekistan\u2019s primary trade \ufb02ows. Uzbekistan\u2019s exports \ndepend heavily on prices for a few major commodities and developments \nin a handful of countries. A more diverse and sophisticated export \nbase is essential to minimize external shocks and ensure export \ncompetitiveness, highlighting the importance of securing the continued \ntransfer of technology along with capital equipment procured under the \nstate-led industrial development program. \n\nImportant as technology transfer may be, economic growth in \n\nUzbekistan still comes mainly from factor accumulation, notably \nincreases in the capital stock.

The lack of innovation also \nre\ufb02ects low spending on research and development (R&D), equal to only \n0.2% of GDP, compared with more than 2.5% in advanced economies. \nState-owned research institutions dominate the \ufb01nancing of R&D \nfor lack of interest among enterprises and foreign investors in innovative \nproducts, which represent only 7% of industrial output. Moreover, \nbarely 0.5% of enterprises use innovative technologies for production, \nand the number of patent applications has languished for over a \ndecade (Figure\u00a03.8.8). Three-quarters of \ufb01rms interviewed in a recent \nWorld\u00a0Bank industrial survey had not introduced any new products in \nthe past 3 years, and only 1% had contracts with local R&D institutes. \nConstraints on innovation include the high costs and economic risks of \ninnovation, a shortage of quali\ufb01ed personnel, and the lack of \ufb01nancial \nresources, incentives, and information about new technologies.\nInnovation needs support from appropriate interventions to \nstrengthen technological capacity in domestic \ufb01rms. The speed and \ndepth of technological upgrading are closely linked to how domestic \n\ufb01rms acquire technological knowledge: through informal learning, \nforeign direct investment, or licensing. \n\nLiberalizing foreign trade and promoting foreign investment \n\nfacilitate access to global technology and innovation. Though exposing \nthe country to more volatility, a more open economy promotes the \nadoption of external knowledge through trade and foreign investment. \nIt also facilitates the absorption of foreign technology, which helps \ndeveloping countries catch up with more advanced economies and grow. \nUzbekistan\u2019s high costs of external trade (as evidenced by consistently \nlow ratings for trading across borders in the World Bank\u2019s annual \nDoing\u00a0Business surveys) and inadequate access to foreign exchange \nhamper knowledge acquisition and, thus, economic restructuring. \nAccordingly, measures to lower trade barriers and liberalize access \nto foreign exchange would promote innovation and long-term \ncompetitiveness.\n\nWhile learning and technological absorption occur at the \ufb01rm \n\nlevel, the extent to which countries upgrade their technological \nprowess also depends on institutional linkages. Innovation depends \ncritically on facilitating interaction between enterprises and science \nand research institutions, expanding public funding for R&D and \neducation, and enacting measures to reduce the cost of innovation for \nprivate \ufb01rms. Science and research institutions and universities in \nUzbekistan currently develop 72% of all innovations, versus industrial \nenterprises\u2019\u00a07%. Thus, facilitating interaction between research \ninstitutes and \ufb01rms should raise the share of innovative products in \nindustry and accelerate the adoption of innovative processes.\n\n3.8.8\u2002 Uzbekistan patent applications \nto World Intellectual Property \nOrganization\n\nResident\nNonresident\nAbroad\n\nNumber\n\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2003 2005\n\n2007 2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\nSource: World Intellectual Property Organization statistics \ndatabase. www.wippo.int (accessed 3 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f\fEAST ASIA\n\nPEOPLE\u2019S rEPUBLIC OF ChINA\nhONg KONg, ChINA\nrEPUBLIC OF KOrEA\nMONgOLIA\nTAIPEI,ChINA\n\n\fPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n\nEconomic growth continues to decelerate and is increasingly driven by services and consumption. \nInflation  will  rise  but  remain  low  in  2016  and  2017,  and  the  current  account  surplus  will  stay \nbroadly  stable.  The  authorities  need  to  intensify  supply-side  structural  reform  to  improve \neconomic resilience in the face of a darkening international environment, financial market volatility, \nand  financial  and  social  challenges  associated  with  industrial  transformation.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth slowed further from 7.3% in 2014 to 6.9% in 2015 (Figure 3.9.1), \ncontinuing a trend since 2010 as the economy of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) shifts further toward a new normal in which domestic \nconsumption and services are the main engines of growth, with the \ngovernment increasingly focused on growth quality over quantity. \nDespite growth moderation, the PRC has doubled its GDP since 2009 \nto reach $10.8 trillion in 2015, thus continuing to account for about a \nthird of global growth in 2015, almost the same as in 2010 when its \nthen smaller economy was growing by double digits. Apart from the \ndifficulty of sustaining the high growth rates of the past in today\u2019s much \nlarger economy, the moderation mainly re\ufb02ects growth in the workforce \nslipping from its peak in recent years and the short-term adverse \nimpact of measures to alleviate economic, environmental, and social \nimbalances. Delay in the global recovery played a role by suppressing \nexport growth, though the PRC bene\ufb01ted from lower commodity prices. \nOn the supply side, rebalancing progressed further toward growth \n\ndriven by the service sector. Services contributed an estimated \n3.7\u00a0percentage points to GDP growth, while industry contributed \n2.8\u00a0points and agriculture 0.3 points. The share of services in nominal \nGDP increased to 50.5% (Figure 3.9.2). Financial services performed \nparticularly strongly, growth of retail sales remained robust, and the \nhospitality sector stabilized after 2 lean years in which an anticorruption \ninitiative limited scope for lavish entertainment. Within industry, \nconsumer-oriented manufacturing outperformed heavy industry, which \ncontinued to suffer from excess capacity, spillover from an ailing housing \nsector, and lower commodity prices. Heavy industry was the main \nfactor behind the decline in aggregate industrial pro\ufb01ts by 2.3% in 2015. \nPro\ufb01ts\u00a0fell in 12 of 41 industrial subsectors, particularly affecting coal \nmining, petroleum and natural gas, and metals. Five\u00a0northern provinces \nwhere these industries are concentrated reported growth substantially \nbelow the country average. They also reported job losses, though the \nlabor\u00a0market remained stable countrywide with 13.1 million new jobs in \ncities and healthy wage growth. \n\nThis chapter was written by Jurgen Conrad and Jian Zhuang of the People\u2019s Republic of China \nResident Mission, ADB, Beijing.\n\n%\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3.9.1\u2002Economic growth\n\nGross domestic product\nValue added by industry\nRetail sales\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4 Q1\n2016\n\nQ = quarter.\nNote: GDP data for the \ufb01rst quarter of 2016 are not yet \navailable.\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.9.2\u2002Share of sectors in nominal GDP\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002125\n\nOn the demand side, consumption was the main growth engine, \ncontributing 4.6 percentage points to GDP growth, up from 3.7 in\u00a02014 \n(Figure\u00a03.9.3). Investment contributed 2.5 percentage points, down \nfrom 3.4 in 2014, while the contribution of net exports turned negative. \nThe continuing structural slowdown in investment growth was most \npronounced in real estate, which suffers from a large housing overhang. \nThe government cushioned the correction by removing purchase \nrestrictions, improving access to mortgages, relaxing down-payment \nrequirements, and accelerating public housing construction and \nshantytown redevelopment. Real estate sales grew in recent months and \nprices increased, even as unsold \ufb02oor space kept rising (Figure\u00a03.9.4). \n\nGrowth in manufacturing investment decelerated further due to an \nuncertain business outlook, particularly for capital-intensive industries, \nand a high corporate debt burden weighing most heavily on state-\nowned enterprises. Investment in infrastructure slowed less, bene\ufb01ting \nfrom government support. Consumption remained robust, supported \nby strong growth in households\u2019 real disposable income, which rose \nby 7.4% year on year, driven by higher wages and social transfers. \nStock\u00a0market volatility since mid-2015 did not affect consumption, \nas\u00a0stocks are only a fraction of \ufb01nancial wealth even for the small 7% \nof the urban population with trading accounts (Figure\u00a03.9.5). Indeed, \nurban depositors\u2019 propensity to spend increased markedly in the second \nhalf of the year, according to a survey by the People\u2019s Bank of China, the \ncentral bank. The disparity between urban and rural household incomes \nnarrowed further from 2.75 times in 2014 to 2.73 in 2015 (Figure\u00a03.9.6), \nedging the official Gini coefficient of inequality further down to 0.462 \nfrom 0.469 in 2014 and 0.473 in 2013. \n\nConsumer price in\ufb02ation averaged 1.4% year on year in 2015, down \n\nfrom 2.0% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2013, and substantially below the central \nbank\u2019s in\ufb02ation ceiling of 3.0% (Figure\u00a03.9.7). This moderation mainly \nre\ufb02ected lower prices for imported food and other commodities in \nline with global trends and renminbi appreciation in real effective \nterms. Core in\ufb02ation, which excludes energy and food, remained stable \nat\u00a01.6%. Average producer price de\ufb02ation intensi\ufb01ed from 1.9% in 2014 \nto 5.2% in 2015 as falling global commodity prices reduced industrial \ninput costs, which have a large weight in the PRC producer price index. \nPersistent\u00a0excess capacity in a number of industries likely did not affect \nthe producer price index, as it was broadly stable during the year.\n\nFiscal policy became more expansionary in 2015 and was instrumental \n\nto achieving the official GDP growth target of \u201cabout\u00a07%.\u201d The de\ufb01cit \nin the official consolidated budget of the central and local governments \nnearly doubled from 1.8% of GDP in 2014 to 3.5% as growth in \nexpenditure outpaced revenue (Figure 3.9.8). Consolidated government \nexpenditure grew by 11.8% year on year in the \ufb01rst half of 2015 and \nby 19.4% in the second half, to average 15.9% in 2015. Only\u00a0part\u00a0of the \nincrease can be explained by the inclusion in consolidated expenditure \nof sizable off-budget spending by local governments.

Nevertheless, \naccording to the Ministry of Finance, many sub-provincial governments \nstill have debt-to-revenue ratios above the official ceiling of 100%, and \nsome still violate restrictions imposed on off-budget borrowing.\n\nTo keep funding costs stable in light of moderating in\ufb02ation, the \n\ncentral bank cut regulatory reserve requirements and benchmark \nloan and deposit rates on several occasions and injected liquidity into \nthe banking system through open market operations and re\ufb01nancing \nfacilities for selected banks. As a result, money market rates fell to \nhistoric lows in nominal terms, as did benchmark deposit, lending, and \nmortgage rates (Figure 3.9.9). Lending rates declined a bit if de\ufb02ated \nby the consumer price index but increased if de\ufb02ated by the producer \nprice index. Despite increased capital out\ufb02ows, broad money (M2) \nsupply growth averaged 11.9% in 2015, only marginally down from 12.7% \nin\u00a02014, and was 5.5 percentage points above nominal GDP growth, up \nfrom a 4.6 point difference in 2014 and 4.7 points in 2013 (Figure 3.9.10). \nHence, debt and its associated risks continued to mount. Bank lending \ngrew strongly, particularly in the second half of the year. The estimated \nstock of total social \ufb01nancing (a broader gauge of \ufb01nancing provided to \nnon\ufb01nancial enterprises and households from banks, nonbank \ufb01nancial \ninstitutions, and capital markets) expanded by an average of 15% in 2015. \nThese developments suggest that economic activity was not constrained \nby credit supply. \n\nFinancial intermediation became more transparent as banks and \n\ncapital markets gained ground at the expense of nonbank \ufb01nancial \ninstitutions, mainly due to regulatory tightening and policy initiatives \nincluding central bank lending facilities provided through banks. \nBank\u00a0loans accounted for almost 70% of total social \ufb01nancing provided \nin 2015, up\u00a0from 61.8% in 2014, while credit from trust funds and other \nnonbanks plunged to only 3.8% from 17.6% in 2014 and a peak of 29.8% \nin 2013 (Figure 3.9.11). The role of equity in enterprise \ufb01nance continued \nto grow despite a setback after midyear stock market turbulence, and \nit accounted for 5.0% of total social \ufb01nancing in 2015, up from 2.7% \nin 2014 and only marginal contributions in preceding years. Similarly, \ncorporate bonds contributed 18.5% of total social \ufb01nancing, up from \n12.3% in 2014. Local governments\u2019 off-budget \ufb01nancing vehicles \ncontinued to account for a substantial share of corporate bond issuance. \nThe renminbi is pegged to a basket of currencies that is undisclosed \n\nbut was estimated in 2014 to be weighted 90% in US dollars.

By July 2015, according to the Bank for International \nSettlements, the renminbi appreciated by more than 14% year on \nyear in nominal effective terms (against a trade-weighted basket of \ncurrencies) and in real effective terms, taking in\ufb02ation into account \n(Figure 3.9.12).

As a result, the \nappreciation of the renminbi against trade partner currencies moderated \nto about 1.5% year on year by January 2016 in both nominal and real \nterms. The\u00a0government also improved foreign central banks\u2019 access to \nthe currency market and its reporting about official reserves, which \nfacilitated the decision of the Executive Board of the International \nMonetary Fund in November 2015 to include the renminbi in special \ndrawing rights by September 2016. The authorities have recently \nindicated that they will pay more attention to the nominal effective rate \nas a benchmark, which suggests that they will change the composition \nof the basket and lower the weight of the US dollar. This expectation has \nalready generated more exchange rate volatility against that currency. \nExports fell by 4.4% year on year in dollar terms in 2015 as global \n\ndemand remained soft. However, real export growth was stronger \nthan the dollar \ufb01gures suggest, given the weakness of other invoicing \ncurrencies like the euro and the Japanese yen. Further, while a stronger \nrenminbi might have narrowed the competitive edge of the PRC relative \nto its trade partners, the PRC has not lost global market share, according \nto the central bank, and the share of high-tech products in overall \nexports increased. \n\nThe import bill also fell, by 13.4% in US dollar terms, owing to lower \n\ncommodity prices and important structural changes: Imports of raw \nmaterials declined as domestic demand for construction materials and \nenergy weakened, while robust demand for consumer goods, including \ncars, and for intermediate products and machinery is increasingly \nmet by domestic suppliers. Imports would have fallen even more if \noil import volume had not increased by 8.8%, most likely to build up \nreserves. \n\nThe result was a trade surplus one-third above 2014. This propelled \nthe current account surplus up to $293.2 billion, or 2.7% of GDP, despite \na sharp increase in the services de\ufb01cit caused by substantial overseas \nexpenditure by outbound tourists (Figure 3.9.13). Nevertheless, the \nbalance of payments was pushed into de\ufb01cit by smaller net in\ufb02ows of \nforeign direct investment and larger net out\ufb02ows of other investment, \nincluding repayment of trade credits and other foreign currency loans, \nand by PRC exporters\u2019 retention abroad of foreign currency proceeds \nin expectation of further renminbi depreciation (Figure 3.9.14). \nGross\u00a0international reserves declined accordingly by $513 million \n(including valuation changes caused by US dollar strength vis-\u00e0-vis \nother reserve currencies) at the end of 2015 but remained sizable at \n$3.4\u00a0trillion, or 31.2% of GDP.\n\nEconomic prospects \nFurther weakening of economic growth momentum in early 2016 and \nthe likely adverse short-term impact of structural reform, including \nreduced investment in industries with excess capacity, point to \ncontinued deceleration in economic growth over the forecast period, \nalbeit somewhat mitigated by \ufb01scal stimulus targeted to maintain social \nand \ufb01nancial stability.

Investment in real \n\nestate and capital-intensive industries with excess capacity will show \nparticularly weak growth over the forecast period. This can be only partly \ncompensated by sustained government spending on infrastructure and by \nhigher investment in services and consumer-oriented manufacturing\u2014\ntwo areas where growth is likely to hold up. Infrastructure investment \nwill continue to enjoy strong government support, though its growth rate \nwill likely decline further (Figure 3.9.16). Moreover, with only a 22% share \nin overall investment, infrastructure investment cannot contribute as \nmuch to GDP growth as does investment in manufacturing or real estate. \nGovernment support for investment activity indicates that reducing the \nhigh share of investment in GDP (perhaps 45%), in line with the strategy \nof rebalancing GDP toward consumption, will be managed over several \nyears to avoid a hard landing in the short term. \n\nConsumption growth will remain more robust. However, with \nincomes in poorer parts of the country still heavily dependent on \nslowing investment on large projects, consumption may weaken \nsomewhat along with decelerating income growth. As in previous years, \nnet exports are unlikely to make a signi\ufb01cant contribution to growth.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is projected to rise over the forecast period as administered \n\nprices are further deregulated, and as commodity prices recover from \ncurrent lows, but it will be held below the government ceiling of 3.0% \nby decelerating GDP growth (Figure 3.9.17). Thus, there is still room \nfor interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, but the authorities may opt \ninstead to reduce regulatory reserve requirements, which are still \nvery high at 17.0% for large banks after the last cut on 1 March\u00a02016. \nThe\u00a0central bank seems to be moving toward a monetary policy \noriented to interest rates but is likely to maintain quantitative tools to \ncontrol credit supply for priority sectors. High growth in lending and \nassociated risks, particularly related to a high debt burden in those parts \nof industry that are most affected by decelerating economic activity, \nwill continue to deserve close attention. With continuing liberalization \nof capital movements, more \ufb02exibility in exchange rate policy will be \nneeded over time to make monetary policy more effective.\n\nThe government has announced that \ufb01scal policy will stay \n\nexpansionary. Efforts to curb local government spending will continue \nover the forecast period toward achieving the strategic objective of \nrendering local government \ufb01nance more efficient, accountable, and \nsustainable. Official budget de\ufb01cits will widen as more off-budget \nactivities of local governments are brought on budget. Legislative and \ninstitutional preparations for a national property tax that will raise local \ngovernment revenues have made progress but will take time to complete. \nTherefore, further increases in central government transfers can be \nexpected. An alternative would be to redistribute personal income \nand consumption tax receipts from the center to local governments. \nFurther, responsibility for \ufb01nancing and implementing major projects \nwill be shifted away from local governments, thus ameliorating their \nneed for unorthodox \ufb01nancing.

If bond ratings and yields further diverge according to how \ncreditworthy the issuers are, this would signal that the program is \nbecoming increasingly market driven.\n\nThe current account surplus will be maintained in 2016 but decline \n\nsomewhat in 2017. Imports, following the pattern set by commodity \nprices, are forecast to be lower in 2016 but higher in 2017, while exports \nare unlikely to pick up strongly in light of lackluster global growth \nand trade. Exports with higher value added will continue to grow, \nhowever, compensating for diminished exports with lower value added. \nThe\u00a0services de\ufb01cit will continue to widen, especially in the absence of \nsubstantial additional progress toward service sector deregulation. \nThe government is expected to peg the renminbi to a more \ndiversi\ufb01ed basket of currencies over the forecast period and thereby \nkeep it broadly stable in trade-weighted terms. Capital \ufb02ows are thus \nlikely to become even more a function of progress toward opening \nthe capital account and reforming the domestic \ufb01nancial sector. \nThe authorities are expected to improve equity market governance, \nstreamline procedures for share issuance, and license more private \nbanks to improve resource mobilization and allocation. Administrative \nmeasures taken in late 2015 and early 2016 to slow capital out\ufb02ows \nare likely to be only temporary. The government will continue to \npursue its strategic objective of further opening the capital account by \nimproving cross-border capital movement, but not at the expense of \n\ufb01nancial stability. It will retain sufficient controls to limit potentially \ndestabilizing short-term capital \ufb02ows. In February 2015, the government \nsubstantially broadened and simpli\ufb01ed foreign private investors\u2019 access \nto the domestic bond market, which at $7.3 trillion is the third largest in \nthe world. This has potential to increase net capital in\ufb02ows; foreigners \ncurrently hold less than 2% of domestic bonds. Additional channels \nfor private cross-border capital transfer would likely facilitate capital \nout\ufb02ow. A reduction in low-yielding official reserves could be in the \ninterest of the PRC, particularly if it results from an increase in higher-\nyielding outbound foreign investment. \n\nThe principal international risks to the projections arise from \nthe worsening global investment climate, considerable volatility in \n\ufb01nancial markets, and another dip in global commodity prices since \nthe beginning of 2016. Complicating these developments is uncertainty \nabout the economic trajectory of the PRC, which could affect investor \nand consumer sentiment worldwide and put the global recovery at risk, \nthereby reverberating back on the PRC. \n\nThe principal domestic risk is that uncertainty about PRC \nexchange rate policy could create expectations of further renminbi \ndepreciation, which would accelerate capital out\ufb02ows and invite \nadditional administrative measures to stem them. Wavering on renminbi \ninternationalization could erode con\ufb01dence in PRC market reform more \nbroadly, exacerbating negative sentiment. This risk could be defused \nby better explaining the new PRC exchange rate regime and policy, as \nwell as the composition of the peg basket, which should include only \ncurrencies that are sufficiently liquid.\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3.9.15\u2002GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.9.16\u2002 Nominal growth in key components \n\nof fixed asset investment\n\nManufacturing\nReal estate\nInfrastructure\n\n%, year to date\n\nJan\n2014\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.9.17\u2002 Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f3.9.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n6.5\n\n1.7\n\n2.7\n\n6.3\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n130\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nAnother domestic risk is that consumer sentiment could be \nundermined if income growth decelerates further and labor market \nconditions become more complicated as industrial restructuring \nprogresses, changing consumption patterns in ways that are difficult \nto predict. Continued close attention to labor market conditions and \nincome growth will be needed. \n\nSlower economic growth and rapid credit expansion, including \ncredit to inefficient \ufb01rms, harbor risks to the quality of bank assets. \nNonperforming loans officially account for less than 2% of the loan \nportfolio, but an increasing number of loans overdue for more than \n90\u00a0days are not classi\ufb01ed as problem loans. Further, continuing \nstrong credit growth may mask more serious repayment problems. \nThese\u00a0risks are, however, still manageable. Recent interest rate cuts \nhave reduced \ufb01nancing costs, loan-loss reserves are still twice as high \nas the official nonperforming loan total, and banks are well capitalized \nand further strengthening their capital base by issuing shares and \nsubordinated loans. In addition, safeguarding \ufb01nancial stability is a key \nmotivation for the government\u2019s policy favoring a managed slowdown in \neconomic\u00a0growth.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014trimming excess property \ninventory and industrial capacity\nSince the Central Economic Work Conference in December 2015, the \ngovernment has stressed the need to accelerate \u201csupply-side reform.\u201d \nThis emphasis is not new. Reform in the PRC over the past 35 years has \nbeen mostly about supply-side reform, or how to use existing human \nand physical resources more efficiently by reforming prices, company \nownership, and the \ufb01nancial sector while opening up to trade and \nforeign investment, streamlining the role of the government in the \neconomy, and strengthening markets. The reform agenda outlined in \nNovember 2013 consists mainly of structural reform aiming to increase \nproductivity and ensure that high growth over the long term propels the \nPRC toward high-income status. Reemphasizing supply-side reform now \nhighlights the government\u2019s policy that, although targeted demand-side \nsupport through monetary and \ufb01scal policy will continue, structural \nreform will remain the priority going forward.\n\nTwo key supply-side reforms among several identi\ufb01ed by the \ngovernment are reducing the housing overhang to reenergize the \nreal estate sector and alleviating excess capacity in manufacturing. \nStrengthening local government \ufb01nances is a precondition for success \nin\u00a0both areas.\n\nThe way to move the property inventory is to generate demand \nfor housing by deepening land reform in rural areas and liberalizing \nthe household registration (hukou) system. Rural land reform, which \naims to facilitate land sales to give rural residents the seed money \nthey need to successfully establish themselves in cities, should be \naccelerated even though some pilot projects reportedly met local \nresistance. The\u00a0government\u2019s plan to expand low-rent public housing \nprograms could bene\ufb01t some migrant workers, but implementing hukou \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002131\n\nreform would be more effective. If provided with full urban resident \nrights through hukou reform, and with better access to credit, many \nof the 274 million rural migrants currently in urban areas could take \nup unsold properties. The government\u2019s urbanization plan foresees \n100\u00a0million more migrants permanently settling in urban areas. For\u00a0this \nurbanization program to succeed, migrants must have full access to \npublic services in cities, which requires stronger local government \n\ufb01nances. Another challenge is to ensure that the migrants are trained \nappropriately for urban jobs. \n\nMany companies with excess capacity, most of them state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs), use outmoded technology to generate meager pro\ufb01ts, \nif not losses, and are deeply in debt. Because these companies are \ninherently inefficient, supporting them through stimulus programs to \nraise demand for their products has aggravated problems rather than \nsolved them. However, reducing excess capacity by closing enterprises \nfaces several challenges, including widespread layoffs and related \nincreases of social spending, falling tax revenues, and loan losses. \nADB estimates that reducing excess capacity in iron and steel, \ncoal mining, cement, shipbuilding, aluminum, and \ufb02at glass by 20% \nmight eliminate 3.6 million jobs, or 0.7% of total nonfarm employment. \nThese\u00a0losses would be concentrated in cities and regions that specialize \nin mining and metal production. Concerned about how closing \nsuch \ufb01rms could derail near-term growth, social stability, and local \ngovernment \ufb01nances, the government has set less ambitious targets to \nreduce production capacity for steel by 10%\u201315% and for coal by 10% \nwithin 3\u20135 years.\n\nMany local governments are already struggling as revenues from \n\nland sales shrink and debt for infrastructure and social housing \nconstruction grows, leaving them dependent on taxes paid by state-\nowned enterprises. Closing these enterprises might squeeze local \ngovernments\u2019 revenues further while forcing them to spend more on \nsocial security. The central government has promised to help pay for \nsocial bene\ufb01ts and the retraining of laid-off workers, and intends to \nestablish a special fund for this purpose, among other measures. \nAs most state-owned enterprises with excess capacity depend \n\nheavily on bank lending and have high ratios of debt to assets \n(estimated\u00a0at 68% in the coal sector in 2015), forcing them into \nbankruptcy threatens banks\u2019 balance sheets with more nonperforming \nloans. This\u00a0is one reason why the government encourages mergers \nrather than bankruptcy\u00a0to meet the challenge of excess capacity. \nThe\u00a0merger process must be well managed to ensure that the merged \nenterprises run efficiently and are not burdened by unsustainable debt. \nThe government should also make it easier for banks to acknowledge \nand write off nonperforming loans. For instance, it should rescind \nthe policy of requiring a lower credit allocation to a region, city, \nand industry if a single industry or state-owned enterprise in it \nincurs excessive bad debt, as this policy penalizes enterprises that \nperform well. This\u00a0would reduce local authorities\u2019 resistance to \nclosing hopelessly indebted and inefficient enterprises, improve credit \nallocation, and support the development of well\u00a0performing enterprises \nin their jurisdiction.\n\n\fHong Kong, China\n\nGrowth  slowed  to  2.4%  in  2015,  but  inflation  eased  and  the  current  account  and  fiscal  position \nwere  healthy.  Growth  will  be  still  slower  in  2016  and  2017  with  weak  tourism  and  global  trade. \nInflation  will  remain  subdued,  and  the  current  account  surplus  will  narrow.  The  dollar  peg  can \naccommodate  US  interest  rate  hikes  and  growing  ties  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  but \nthese  developments  foreshadow  broader  policy  challenges.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP grew by 2.4% in 2015, down from 2.6% in 2014. Sluggish global \ntrade and signi\ufb01cant volatility in the \ufb01nancial markets of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) halted the upward growth trajectory enjoyed in \nthe \ufb01rst half of the year. Uncertainty about the timing of US interest rate \nhikes exerted downward pressure on domestic demand, asset prices, and \nmarket sentiment.\n\nDomestic demand nevertheless remained the main engine of growth \n\nin 2015. Private consumption expanded by 4.8% and contributed 3.2 \npercentage points to GDP growth (Figure 3.10.1). Rising real incomes, \nmoderating in\ufb02ation, and low unemployment helped offset the drag \nfrom weak retail sales amid softening tourist arrivals. Government \nconsumption also expanded, but its contribution to growth remained \nunchanged at 0.3 percentage points. Investment fell by 7.3%, shaving \n1.7 percentage points from GDP growth. Investment in machinery and \nequipment acquisition declined, together with inventories, but private \nconstruction outlays remained resilient. Net exports broke their 4-year \nnegative streak, contributing 0.7 percentage points to growth. Imports \nshrank by 1.8% year on year because of low consumption demand from \nvisitors, while exports fell by 1.5% as external demand and inbound \ntourism weakened (Figure 3.10.2). \n\ndrove growth on the supply side. Construction grew by 1.7% on a \nbuoyant private sector, and expansion in most services propelled growth \nin the service sector to 1.9%. \n\nThe current account surplus widened to 3.1% of GDP as the \n\nmerchandise balance improved, though the services surplus narrowed \non weak tourist arrivals and trade and cargo \ufb02ows. The improved \ncurrent account and large net in\ufb02ows of direct and other investment \noffset net out\ufb02ows of portfolio capital, enlarging the overall balance of \npayments surplus. Gross official reserves rose to $359 billion by the end \nof 2015, cover for 7.1 months of imports. \n\nThis chapter was written by Benno Ferrarini and Marthe Hinojales of the Economic\u00a0Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\nWhile expanding slower than in 2014, construction and services \n\nHK$ billion\n\n3.10.1\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nInvestment\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\n \n\nPercentage points\n\n4.8\n\n1.7\n\n3.1\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 25 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.10.2\u2002External trade\n\nNet exports of services\nNet exports of goods\n\n \n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n-100\n\n-200\n\n%\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\n2014\n\n2015\n\n \n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 25 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nHong Kong, China\u2002\u2002133\n\nConsumer price in\ufb02ation slowed to 3.0% from 4.4% the previous \nyear (Figure 3.10.3). External price pressures continued to recede in \nlight of subdued international prices for food and other commodities, \nlow imported in\ufb02ation, and a strengthening US dollar, to which the \nlocal dollar is pegged. Steady labor costs and softer rental growth \nhelped contain domestic costs. After rising early in the year, residential \nproperty prices calmed in the fourth quarter, falling by 7% quarter \non\u00a0quarter.\n\nOn the \ufb01scal front, the government expects the budget surplus to \nnarrow to the equivalent of 1.3% of GDP in FY2015 (ending\u00a031\u00a0March \n2016), with \ufb01scal reserves equal to 35.8% (Figure 3.10.4). Estimated \nrevenues were below the original estimate mainly because land \nsales were lower and HK$45 billion was set aside for the Housing \nReserve, established to \ufb01nance public housing programs. Meanwhile, \nexpenditures increased modestly along with higher social welfare \nservices, which absorb 15% of government expenditure. Overall public \nexpenditure in FY2015 is estimated to equal 19.2% of GDP, in line with \nthe \ufb01scal management guideline of holding public expenditure below \n20.0% of GDP.\n\nMonetary conditions remained loose, while macroprudential \nmeasures implemented in February 2015 helped bring down the \naverage loan-to-value ratio and debt-servicing ratio of new mortgages. \nMeanwhile, a softening property market and the government\u2019s \ndemand-management measures tamped down the volume and value \nof new mortgages and suppressed speculative buying (Figure 3.10.5). \nDomestic\u00a0credit growth slowed to 3.9%, and growth in broad money \n(M2) supply further decelerated to 5.5% from 9.5% in 2014. The \nHong\u00a0Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) raised its benchmark base rate \nin December 2015 to 0.75% from 0.50% in tandem with the US Federal \nReserve\u2019s increase of its federal funds rate. \n\nUncertainty about the US interest rate hike and concern over the \n\nPRC economy wiped out early hefty gains on the Hang Seng Stock \nExchange Index, pushing it 7.2% lower by year-end (Figure 3.10.6). \nHong\u00a0Kong, China remains a leading international fund-raising \nplatform, raising in 2015 over HK$260 billion with initial public \nofferings, a 13% rise over 2014 that propelled it past New York and \nShanghai to \ufb01rst place by this measure. Its role as the premier center \nfor offshore renminbi trading has been strengthened with an additional \nissuance of PRC sovereign bonds and the opening of new channels for \ntwo-way \ufb01nancial \ufb02ows with the PRC, including the mutual recognition \nof funds, which allows eligible locally domiciled funds in either market \nto be sold to retail investors in the other.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGDP growth is projected to slow to 2.1% in 2016 and recover to 2.2% \nin 2017 (Figure 3.10.7).

Imports will stay constrained by weakness in \nboth retained imports and export-induced demand. The trade de\ufb01cit \nwill be offset by a modest surplus in the services account as demand \nfor professional and \ufb01nancial services offsets weaker tourism. In the \nnear term, the government\u2019s strategic focus on innovative technologies \ncan, along with positive spillover from the new 5-year plan of the PRC, \nprovide support to the local services account. The current account \nsurplus is forecast to narrow to 2.0% of GDP in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast at 2.5% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017. Soft international \ncommodity prices will keep external price pressures at bay, and local cost \nincreases will be restrained by slower economic growth and lower rents. \nThese factors will counter a slight uptick in world oil and commodity \nprices in 2017.\n\nThe FY2016 budget is expected to post a small surplus of \nHK$11\u00a0billion. To boost the economy, it has as one-time measures \ntax\u00a0reductions for households and \ufb01rms and waivers of property rates, \nbusiness registration fees, and fees for tourism-related trades. Recurrent \nmeasures include higher tax allowances and deduction ceilings for \npayers of salaries tax. Ample \ufb01scal reserves will enable an increase in the \n\ufb01scal stimulus should the economy show signs of weakening. Sufficient \nhousing supply remains a core objective. Expenditure is thus expected \nto remain close to the government\u2019s guideline of 20% of GDP. To address \nthe longer-term \ufb01scal challenges arising from an aging population, the \ngovernment is implementing a 3-year expenditure-control measure and, \nin January 2016, established its Future Fund by investing a portion of \n\ufb01scal reserves in long-term assets for achieving higher returns. \n\nOne risk to growth is negative spillover from the PRC as it transitions \n\nto more sustainable growth, which could harm employment and \nbusiness conditions but could also create higher demand from the PRC \nfor services. The other main risk is unexpectedly sharp increases in \nUS interest rates, which could tighten monetary conditions, deepen \nthe current correction in residential property, and burden the private \nsector with potentially soaring debt service costs, further weakening \ndomestic demand. The risk of a \u201cperfect storm\u201d\u2014a sharp PRC downturn \ncoinciding with heightened volatility from further US rate hikes\u2014is small \nbut signi\ufb01cant. Yet the economy remains resilient, buffered by prudent \neconomic management, ample \ufb01scal resources to \ufb01nance countercyclical \nmeasures, and a sound \ufb01nancial system able to withstand external \nheadwinds.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014pressure on the exchange rate \nThe start of 2016 witnessed some downward pressure on the local \ndollar. In January, the currency dropped to its lowest value against the \nUS dollar in nearly a decade.

It stands by the currency board, which has since 1983 \nbeen central to economic development and the emergence of Hong Kong, \nChina as a global \ufb01nancial center. Proximity to the PRC is one thing, \nbut the monetary link with the US has suited the local economy as an \nanchor and its \ufb01nancial system as a stabilizer. A fully backed monetary \nbase and diligent \ufb01scal management over the years have helped the \nlinked exchange rate system outlast many past crises, including the Asian \n\ufb01nancial crisis of 1997\u20131998, when it survived severe speculative attack.\nThe argument for pegging to the renminbi is likely to solidify as \n\ufb01nancial ties with the PRC continue to grow. Changing the currency \nregime may deserve consideration when the PRC currency is freely \nconvertible, its capital account fully liberalized, and its \ufb01nancial \nsystem well developed. These conditions are, however, not yet in view. \nIn\u00a0the meantime, \ufb01nancial integrity should be preserved by continuing \nto adhere to high regulatory and supervisory standards, deploying \nmacroprudential measures as appropriate, and continuing prudent \n\ufb01scal\u00a0policies. \n\nThe government\u2019s \ufb01scal reserves accumulated through sustained \n\ufb01scal discipline and year after year of budget surpluses have kept the \npeg credible. Its \ufb01scal health remains strong in the short term. However, \n\ufb01scal reserves are seen gradually diminishing over the longer term, \nmainly because the government has earmarked additional provision \nover the medium term for health-care reform and retirement protection. \nRecurrent expenditures are set to increase in the coming years as an \naging population requires expanded social services, and the tax base \nwill likely become narrower with a shrinking workforce. Ensuring good \n\ufb01scal management to support the peg depends on strengthening the \nrevenue regime by broadening the tax base and avoiding any reliance on \nvolatile and cyclical sources such as land sales.\n\n%\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\n\u201360\n\n34,000\n\n28,000\n\n22,000\n\n16,000\n\nQ1\n2011\n\nQ1\n2012\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ = quarter.\nNote: Net balance of expected quarter-on-quarter \nchanges in the business situation.

The recovery, supported \nby \ufb01scal stimulus and an accommodative monetary policy, came as the \nimpact of MERS on domestic demand began to fade in the third quarter \n(Figure\u00a03.11.1). \n\nInvestment contributed 2.2 percentage points to GDP growth \n\n(Figure 3.11.2). Construction investment picked up after a subdued \ufb01rst \nhalf to record 4.0% growth for the year, and sustained growth in plant \nand equipment investment by 5.2% drove the surge in investment. \n\nConsumption grew by 2.4% in 2015 and contributed 1.6 percentage \n\npoints to GDP growth. Private consumption expanded by 2.1% and \ngovernment consumption by 3.3%. Consumer spending surged in \nthe second half as consumer sentiment reached a 14-month high \nin November and employment prospects improved (Figure 3.11.3). \nJob\u00a0creation strengthened in the \ufb01nal quarter, and the labor \nparticipation rate reached 62.6% in 2015, the highest since 2000. \nThe unemployment rate declined steadily, but the annual average \nunemployment rate remained at 3.6%.

The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit widened to 3.0% of GDP from 2.0% \nin\u00a02014, raising government domestic debt to an estimated 36.6% of GDP \nfrom 33.9%.\n\nGrowth was also supported by an accommodative monetary policy. \n\nThe Bank of Korea, the central bank, cut its policy rate in March and \nJune 2015 to a record low of 1.5%. Nevertheless, monthly in\ufb02ation \nremained below 1% in most months, and annual in\ufb02ation averaged 0.7% \nas global oil prices languished, with core in\ufb02ation averaging slightly \nabove 2% during the year (Figure 3.11.5). In\ufb02ation slipped back to 0.8% \nin January 2016 from 1.3% in December as oil prices continued to fall.\nThe easy monetary policy has further deepened household debt, \nwhich amounted to a record $1.0 trillion, or 78.9% of GDP, at the end \nof\u00a02015 (Figure 3.11.6). Mortgages accounted for 41.5% of household \ndebt, confronting policy makers with a quandary over how to support \nthe housing market while containing household debt.\n\nExports suffered as shipments to all major destinations declined. \nExports to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), accounting for about \none-fourth of all merchandise exports, have contracted since early \n2014 and dropped further by 5.6% in 2015 as that economy decelerated \n(Figure 3.11.7). Exports to the European Union also fell by 6.9% and \nthose to the US slipped by 1.0%. In US dollar terms, merchandise \nexports declined by 10.5% in 2015, but imports contracted even more \nsharply by 18.2%, partly re\ufb02ecting the steep decline in global commodity \nprices. In January 2016, imports fell further by 20.1%, while exports \ndeclined by 18.6%, the sharpest drop since 2009.\n\nThe current account surplus widened to an estimated 7.8% of GDP in \n\n2015 from 6.0% in 2014, ensuring a healthy overall balance of payments \nsurplus despite foreign portfolio out\ufb02ows. Amid turbulence in global \n\ufb01nancial markets, the country posted net foreign portfolio equity and \ndebt out\ufb02ows by year-end of $7.3 billion, equal to 0.5% of GDP.\n\nAfter mildly appreciating against the US dollar during the \ufb01rst 5 \nmonths, the won slid in the remaining months to close 5.8% lower by the \nend of the year. In real effective terms, it appreciated by 0.7% during the \nyear, owing to an in\ufb02ation rate higher than those of trade partners.\n\nEconomic prospects \nAgainst a backdrop of subdued external demand, growth is likely to \nstagnate in 2016 at 2.6%. The forecast assumes sustained expansion \nin domestic demand, in particular private consumption, countering \nthe difficult export environment. As the economy remains fragile, \nthe broadly accommodative monetary and \ufb01scal stance is expected \nto continue. Growth will edge up to 2.8% in 2017, assuming stable \nexpansion in the global economy (Figure 3.11.8). \n\nGrowth in private consumption is expected to accelerate slightly this \nyear on improving consumer sentiment. In the absence of a major shock, \nprivate consumption will rise by 2.2% in 2016, spurred by moderating \nprice pressures, given low oil prices, the extension of the lower sales \n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2.6\n\n1.4\n\n6.5\n\n2.8\n\n2.0\n\n5.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.11.3\u2002Growth in private consumption\n\nYear on year\nQuarter on quarter\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\n2014\n\n2015\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Bank of Korea, Economics Statistics System, http://\necos.bok.or.kr/EIndex_en.jsp (accessed\u00a029 January 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.4\u2002 Merchandise export and \n\nimport\u00a0volumes\n\nExports\nImports\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\n2014\n\n2015\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Bank of Korea, Economics Statistics System, http://\necos.bok.or.kr/EIndex_en.jsp (accessed\u00a029 January 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.5\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nOverall \nCore\n\n \n\n%\n\nJan Apr\n2014\n\nJul Oct\n\nJul Oct\n\nJan Apr\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f138\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\ntax on vehicles, and steady growth in employment (Figure\u00a03.11.9). \nThe\u00a0projections also assume effective policy to control mounting \nhousehold debt, which threatens private consumption. To limit further \nbuildup of household debt, the government has started to enforce \nstricter standards for screening mortgage applications and to closely \nmonitor household lending by nonbank institutions. \n\nGrowth in investment, particularly gross \ufb01xed capital, will likely \n\ncontinue its moderate pace. Growth in construction will be buoyed \nby government plans to ease regulations and provide tax incentives \nfor rental housing construction on a large scale. Investment in \nnew industries will \ufb01nd encouragement in government support \nfor investment by small- and medium-sized enterprises through a \nW2\u00a0trillion loan fund, tax incentives for research and development, and \nthe frontloading of expenditure in the Corporate Investment Promotion \nProgram. Growth in plant and equipment is nevertheless likely to slow \nas both external and domestic environments remain uncertain.\n\nExports may rebound on better global prospects in the second half, \n\nbut import growth driven by stronger domestic demand is expected \nto outpace export growth to the forecast horizon. Although oil prices \nare expected to average lower this year, import values will increase as \ngrowth in import volume accelerates. As a result, the current account \nsurplus will narrow to 6.5% in 2016 and further to 5.5% in 2017.\n\nOn the \ufb01scal front, the government will maintain its expansionary \n\nstance to support consumption and investment. Proposed higher \nspending on welfare and employment will bolster domestic demand. \nThe government\u2019s proposed spending and revenue program suggests the \n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cit equaling 2.3% this year\u2014lower than last year though the \ngovernment plans to raise spending by 2.9% in 2016 and expects \ufb01scal \nrevenues to increase by 2.3%. As in 2015, healthy public \ufb01nances will \nallow the government to introduce supplementary budgets if economic \nconditions deteriorate. Meanwhile, to support growth, the government \nannounced that \ufb01rst quarter spending will be W14 trillion higher than a \nyear earlier.\n\nIn tandem with a sustained and moderate expansion in domestic \ndemand and higher oil prices, in\ufb02ation is likely to pick up this year to \n1.4% and next year to 2.0%, which is the central bank\u2019s new annual \nin\ufb02ation target for 2016\u20132018. With price pressures subdued, the central \nbank is likely to keep interest rates at current record lows to stimulate \ndomestic demand, while remaining vigilant about any further buildup in \nhousehold debt.\n\nDownside risks to growth are both internal and external. \n\nDomestically, mounting household debt could tamp down consumption. \nSubdued business con\ufb01dence, which has fallen from already low levels \nsince November 2015 (Figure 3.11.10) owing to a difficult outlook for \nexports and low capacity utilization (Figure 3.11.11), may undermine \nprospects for investment.\n\n Softer-than-expected external demand, especially in the slowing \nPRC, poses probably the single biggest risk to GDP growth. As the PRC \nis an important export market, a sharp growth slowdown there would \nbe a major blow to growth in the short run.

They dampen demand in \noil-exporting countries, which collectively account for 7.1% of exports \nfrom the Republic of Korea. Last year, such exports declined by 15.5%. \nFurther, \ufb01nancial market turmoil in oil producers and other emerging \nmarkets could spill over into the Republic of Korea. \n\nUncertainties generated by US Federal Reserve rate hikes may \ndestabilize \ufb01nancial markets and further dampen sentiment, especially \nin light of the country\u2019s highly open capital account. The stock market \nhas not been immune to the recent selloff in regional equity markets. \nThe Korea Composite Index fell by 8% about a month after the Fed \nhiked its federal funds rate by 25 basis points. Persistent uncertainty \nover asset prices could temper both business and consumer con\ufb01dence. \nA particularly difficult risk to assess is the possibility of heightened \ntension with Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea arising from its \nnuclear program.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening the \nservice\u00a0sector as an engine of growth\nFor several decades, the Republic of Korea pursued export-oriented \nindustrialization, and it successfully developed a globally competitive \nmanufacturing sector. As manufacturing is now highly efficient, \nachieving further productivity gains is a challenge. Indeed, GDP \ngrowth that languished short of 3.0% in 3 of the past 4 years has fueled \nconcerns that potential growth over the medium to long term may have \ndeclined. An effective response would be to unlock potential in the \nservice sector, which could boost growth in the short term and beyond. \nService sector productivity in the Republic of Korea has lagged \n\nbehind both domestic manufacturing and the service sectors of \nother members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) (Figure 3.11.12). This indicates large scope for \ndeveloping the service sector to reduce the economy\u2019s dependence on \ncurrently lackluster exports of manufactured goods. In the high-income, \nhigh-tech economy of the Republic of Korea, service sector development \nshould center on services with high value added. These include \ufb01nancial \nintermediation, computer services, business services, communication, \nand legal and technical services, which currently account for a smaller \nshare of service sector output than do traditional services with lower \nvalue added, such as public administration, wholesale and retail trade, \nand transport and storage.\n\nThe shift from a manufacturing-led economy to a more balanced \none in which services play a larger role requires various reforms, the \nmost crucial of which is deregulation. The service sector is highly \nregulated to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. Strict entry \nand licensing requirements, stringent approval requirements, and price \ncontrols have likely contributed signi\ufb01cantly to low sector productivity. \n\n3.11.9\u2002Employment indicators\n\nEmployed, % of  \nworking\u2212age population \n\nNew workers\n\nThousands\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n-200\n\n2000 2003 2006\n\n2009\n\n2012\n\n2015\n\nSource: ADB estimates based on data from Korean \nStatistical Information Service. http://kosis.kr/eng. \n(accessed 21 January 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.10\u2002Business confidence\n \nIndex\n\nJan Mar May\n2015\n\nJul\n\nSep Nov\n\nJan Mar\n2016\n\nNote: A reading below 100 means that more \ufb01rms \nanswered negatively than positively. \nSource: Bank of Korea, Economics Statistics System, \navailable: http://ecos.bok.or.kr/EIndex_en.jsp \n(accessed\u00a015\u00a0March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.11\u2002Manufacturing capacity utilization\n\n%\n\n61\n\n60\n\n59\n\n58\n\n57\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n \n%\n\n82\n\n79\n\n76\n\n73\n\n70\n\nQ1\n2010\n\nQ1\n2011\n\nQ1\n2012\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Korean Statistical Information Service.  \nhttp://kosis.kr/eng/ (accessed\u00a02\u00a0February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f140\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nAn indication of how regulation in the Republic of Korea fares vis-\u00e0-vis \nother economies is provided by product market regulation indicators, \nwhich measure regulations that are potentially anticompetitive and \ncover state control, barriers to entrepreneurship, and barriers to trade \nand investment.

Growth  will  stagnate  in  2016  under  lower  mining  output  and  necessarily  tight \nmacroeconomic  policies.  Inflation  will  dip  further  before  climbing  again  in  2017.  Consistently \npursuing  fiscal  policy,  effectively  continuing  efforts  to  diversify  the  economy,  and  ensuring  social \nprotection  are  important  challenges  of  economic  management  in  Mongolia.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth decelerated sharply to 2.3% in 2015 from 7.9% in 2014 as \nmacroeconomic policies became less expansionary, falling mineral prices \nand a strong currency eroded exports, and foreign direct investment \ndeclined by 33.8%. On the supply side, growth slowed in all sectors but \nremained robust in industry, which contributed 2.0 percentage points \nto growth, and agriculture, which contributed 0.9 points (Figure 3.12.1). \nIndustrial output rose by 8.8%, supported by 13.0% expansion in mining \nas production at the vast Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine increased. \nHowever, a decline by 1.4% in construction dragged down growth in the \nrest of industry to 0.6%. Agriculture grew by 10.7% despite a drought. \nAs trade and social sectors shrank, service sector growth fell to 1.1%, \nsubtracting 0.7 percentage points from GDP.\n\nOn the demand side, a 27.7% fall in investment following a 30.1% \n\ndecline in 2014 subtracted 9.9 percentage points from growth. \nConsumption growth slowed to 4.6% as government consumption \ndeclined, reducing its contribution to growth to 3.2 percentage points. \nSubstantial import contraction turned net exports positive, which \ncontributed 9.1 percentage points to growth (Figure 3.12.2).\n\nSeveral factors caused average in\ufb02ation to halve to 6.6% from 12.8% \nin 2014. Preemptive slaughtering of livestock in anticipation of a harsh \nwinter sharply reduced meat prices, which have a large weight in the \nconsumer price index. Subdued domestic demand, an insufficiently \n\ufb02exible exchange rate, and tight monetary policy also reduced price \npressures. \n\nIn April 2015, the International Monetary Fund assessed Mongolia \nat high risk of debt distress. The ratio of public debt to GDP, including \nthe central bank\u2019s foreign liabilities, swelled from 31.0% in 2010 to \n77.4% in 2015, with public debt per capita quadrupling to over $3,000 \n(Figure 3.12.3). The budget de\ufb01cit stabilized at 3.1% of GDP in 2015, \nand the consolidated de\ufb01cit\u2014including Development Bank of Mongolia \nexpenditures\u2014shrank to 7.9% of GDP from 11.4% in 2014.

Indeed, the Chinggis bond \n2018 yield peaked at 13.3% in February 2016, following a multiyear low \nof 4.5% in 2015 (Figure 3.12.4). This development and a 16.9% revenue \nshortfall from optimistic assumptions forced a 48.9% cut in government \ninvestment (excluding investments by the Development Bank of \nMongolia), limiting expenditure growth to 1.5%. To further \ufb01scal \nconsolidation, social welfare transfers are better targeted to the poor, \nand inefficiencies in public spending corrected.\n\nThe Economic Transparency Law, 2015 exposed substantial \n\nundeclared income or assets and waived evaded taxes, \ufb01nes, \nand penalties (equivalent to 47% of GDP or 151% of government \nexpenditures). The law expanded the tax base marginally but also \nrewarded tax evasion and may have strengthened incentives to conceal.\nMonetary policy was tightened as the central bank sold foreign \ncurrency and raised its policy rate in August 2014 and January 2015 by \n2.5 percentage points in total, and as the price-stabilization program \nwas phased out. As price pressures receded, the central bank lowered \nits policy rate by 1 percentage point in January 2016. The broad money \nsupply declined by 1.3% in 2015, following 24.6% growth in 2014. \nOutstanding loans declined by 6.5%, but nonperforming loans increased \nby 64.2% to 5.5% and loans past due by 217.8% to 7.5% (Figure 3.12.5). \nAn asset management institution may be established. However, avoiding \na recurrence of nonperforming loan proliferation depends on avoiding \nmoral hazard, strengthening prudential regulation and supervision, and \nprudent monetary policy.\n\nBolstered by central bank interventions totaling $1.2 billion, equal \n\nto 10.2% of GDP, the exchange rate hovered in the range of MNT1,950\u2013\nMNT2,000 per US dollar for most of last year, a depreciation of only \n6% year on year. By its real effective exchange rate, the Mongolian \ntogrog appreciated by an average of 7.8%. Exports declined by 19.2% as \nhigher exports of copper concentrates, oil, and gold by volume failed \nto compensate for declining commodity prices and volume reductions \nin coal and iron ore shipments (Figure 3.12.6). As imports fell by 28.1%, \nthe merchandise trade surplus increased and the current account \nde\ufb01cit narrowed from 11.5% of GDP to 4.8%. With substantial external \nborrowing, this narrowed the overall balance of payments de\ufb01cit to \n$268.1 million from $471.1 million in 2014.\n\ndeclined by $326.8 million to $1.3 billion, reduced by currency \ninterventions but bene\ufb01ting from external debt issuance by the central \nbank and the government, versus $1.9 billion in foreign liabilities. \nPublic\u00a0and publicly guaranteed external debt, including these foreign \nliabilities, rose by 21.5% to equal 65.3% of GDP, heightening the \nvulnerability of the \ufb01scal and external accounts to currency risk \nand \ufb01nancial market volatility. Additional commercial external debt \nwas reportedly incurred in March 2016 to \ufb01nance infrastructure. \nThe\u00a0policy regarding the repayment or re\ufb01nancing of over $1.8 billion \nin external debt due in 2017\u20132018 is yet to be made public.

Agriculture will be the main growth driver, and services \nwill be \ufb02at as demand falters. Industry will bene\ufb01t from the midyear \nstart of underground mine construction at Oyu Tolgoi, ramping up \nin 2017 and likely to generate $2.5 billion in domestic capital cost \nexpenditure to 2022. However, the mine\u2019s ore quality is lower than \noriginally expected, which will affect export values and budget revenues \nin 2016\u20132017. This factor\u2014excluded from this forecast\u2014will be captured \nwhen the government\u2019s GDP estimates are revised later and could lower \ngrowth by 1\u20132 percentage points each year.\n\nAverage in\ufb02ation will stabilize at around 3.0% in 2016, with meat \n\nprices normalizing in the second half of the year (Figure 3.12.8). \nIn\ufb02ation will pick up to 7.0% in 2017 with gradual currency depreciation \nas central bank interventions are expected to be phased out.\n\nInternational reserves face pressure as debt repayments loom and \nthe \ufb01scal situation and the external environment hinder debt issuance. \nMoreover, the current account de\ufb01cit will expand to equal 8.0% of GDP \nin 2016 and 15.0% in 2017, re\ufb02ecting the lower quality of exported ore, \nweak external demand, and increased imports related to Oyu Tolgoi. \nA delay in Oyu Tolgoi underground development would affect \neconomic prospects and raise risk perceptions, thereby constraining \ndebt re\ufb01nancing options. Although a delay is unlikely because project \n\ufb01nancing is secured, the scenario brings to the fore the absolute necessity \nof maintaining policy buffers and prudent macroeconomic\u00a0policy. \nOther\u00a0external risks include lower commodity prices and tightened \nexternal \ufb01nancing conditions. Further, risks to \ufb01scal and external \naccounts would accumulate if large external borrowing occurred at \nhigh\u00a0interest rates (except for debt repayment). \n\nfurther, strengthening debt management, and\u2014most urgently\u2014resolving \nlooming external debt repayments.

In this process, ensuring \nmacroeconomic stability and making mining-led growth sustainable and \ninclusive are the greatest development challenges ahead. \n\nLimited economic diversi\ufb01cation has left Mongolia highly dependent \n\non its mining sector, which relies heavily on in\ufb02ows of foreign direct \ninvestment. This exposes the economy to external shocks caused by \nswings in commodity prices and the economic cycles of its trading \npartners. The current unfavorable external environment\u2014characterized \nby plummeting foreign direct investment, falling commodity prices, and \ngrowth moderation in the PRC\u2014is adversely affecting socioeconomic \nconditions in Mongolia. GDP growth has sharply decelerated, reducing \nemployment. \n\nA decade of heretofore strong economic growth has substantially \nboosted average incomes in Mongolia, reducing the incidence of poverty \nsince 2010 by 17 percentage points to 21.6% in 2014. The poverty rate \nwould be an estimated 10 percentage points higher today in the absence \nof Mongolia\u2019s social welfare programs. Income inequality as measured \nby the Gini coefficient was reduced from 0.36 in 2008 to 0.32 in 2014, \nbut severe disparities remain between urban and rural areas, especially \nthose in the remote western regions. Despite commendable progress, \none in \ufb01ve Mongolians still lives in poverty and depends largely on \nwelfare bene\ufb01ts for basic sustenance.\n\nThe current economic slowdown underscores the importance \nof strengthening social protection in Mongolia. This is particularly \nimportant in the context of the government\u2019s commitment to economic \nrestructuring and adjustment. The \ufb01scal consolidation and monetary \ntightening required to ensure macroeconomic stability could weaken \nthe economy in the short term. A smaller welfare budget would reverse \ngains in poverty reduction by pushing people back below the poverty \nline, perhaps even creating some newly poor. Social welfare programs\u2019 \npast success in reducing poverty argues for their continuation and \nstrengthening.\n\nThe government administers 71 social welfare programs that reached \n\na third of the population in 2014. Expenditures for all programs have \nbeen increased since 2010 to re\ufb02ect demographic trends in an expanding \npopulation, offset the impact of in\ufb02ation on real incomes, and reduce \npoverty. However, challenges persist. Many social welfare programs \nare unnecessarily expensive because they do not target only the poor. \nMoreover, the fragmentation of programs results in the duplication of \nbene\ufb01ts and high administrative and implementation\u00a0costs. Subsidies to \nsupport such programs would have greater impact if\u00a0they were better \ntargeted.\n\nTo reform these welfare programs, policy should improve poverty \ntargeting and consolidate programs to reduce implementation costs and \nstrengthen program impact. Better targeting and consolidation would \nensure the \ufb01scal sustainability of programs as the government strives \nto stabilize the macroeconomic situation and institute the structural \nreform that is essential to laying a foundation for sustainable growth.\n\n\fTaipei,China\n\nGrowth  slowed  in  2015,  prices  fell,  and  the  current  account  surplus  widened.  Growth  will  likely \nbe  higher  in  2016  and  2017  on  countercyclical  government  expenditure  and  robust  private \nconsumption,  with  rises  also  for  inflation  and  the  current  account  surplus.  Ensuring  sustainable \nexport  growth  is  the  main  policy  challenge  but  cannot  be  achieved  through  competitive  currency \ndepreciation.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP expanded by 0.8% in 2015, down from 3.9% in 2014 and the \nweakest growth since 2010, dragged down by declines in government \nexpenditure and exports (Figure 3.13.1). Government consumption \ncontracted by 0.4%, subtracting 0.1 percentage points from growth. \nPrivate consumption was the driver of growth, boosted by subsidies for \nthe purchase of energy-saving products, as well as for rents, transport \nservices, and mobile phone upgrades. It expanded by 2.3%, adding \n1.2\u00a0percentage points to growth as the unemployment rate improved, \nalbeit only marginally and countered by a decline in average monthly \nearnings. Investment rose by 1.5% to contribute 0.3 percentage points \nto growth as private investment remained robust, compensating for \ndeclining government outlays (Figure 3.13.2). Exports of goods and \nservices, which account for 64.5% of GDP, dropped by 0.2% as demand \nfor industrial products weakened in all major trading partners. Imports \nof goods and services expanded by 0.9%, causing net exports to shrink \nby 8.5% and subtract 0.7 percentage points from GDP growth.\n\nOn the supply side, sector growth rates cannot be determined \nbecause of a large discrepancy in the preliminary data, but indications \nare that most sectors stagnated. Sizable declines in mining and \nquarrying, and in electricity and gas, are thought to have pushed down \nindustrial output. The service sector, which is the largest contributor to \nGDP at 62.8%, is thought to have grown only marginally with increases \nin \ufb01nance and insurance and in information and communication, but \ncontraction in wholesale and retail trade.

Government outlays are expected to rise by the equivalent \nof 2.1% of GDP in 2016. Expansionary \ufb01scal policy and the delayed \nimpacts of past measures, such as facilitating companies\u2019 access to \ncredit and investment in real estate, will be the main drivers of growth \nin 2017. Private consumption expenditure should rise modestly in 2016 \nand 2017, bene\ufb01ting from consumer subsidies initiated in November \n2015. Private\u00a0investment will be less robust than in 2015 as sector \nsentiment indexes for manufacturing and services remain low, though \nthe manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index signaled in January \n2016 likely future expansion. Meanwhile, a sharp 12.4% decline year on \nyear in export orders that same month extended contraction in export \norders to 10 consecutive months, pointing to only a modest rise, if any, in \nexports this year (Figure 3.13.5). Weak external demand, especially from \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and rising competition from the \nRepublic of Korea and other economies will counter the potential bene\ufb01t \nto export demand this year and next from higher growth in the US.\nFiscal policy is expected to be expansionary, keeping the de\ufb01cit at \n0.9% of GDP in 2016 but perhaps lower in 2017.

The share of exports to \nHong\u00a0Kong, China has grown to 14%, and exports to the US now \namount to 12% of the total. With 52% of exports going to these three \ndestinations and generating 33% of GDP in Taipei,China, developments \nin these economies strongly in\ufb02uence the sustainability of export \ngrowth. An\u00a0empirical analysis of the sensitivity of these exports to \ngrowth rates in these trade partners shows that economic growth in \nthe PRC and the US are the main determinants of export growth for \nTaipei,China (Table\u00a03.13.2). A 1.0% increase in nominal GDP growth \nin the PRC raises the rate of export growth for Taipei,China by 2.0%, \nwhile a 1.0% increase in nominal GDP growth in the larger but slower-\ngrowing US economy increases it by 4.5%. Therefore, strengthening \neconomic growth in the US over the coming years can be expected to \noffset any weakening of economic growth in the PRC in terms of the \neffect on the rate of export growth for Taipei,China.\n\nHowever, Taipei,China cannot rely on growth in these economies \nalone to sustain its export growth momentum, as these relationships \ncan erode over time with competition from other exporters. Indeed, \ncorrelation analysis indicates that depreciation of the local dollar against \n\n3.13.2\u2002 Determinants of Taipei,China export growth rate (2001\u20132014)\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nUnited States\n\nCoefficient of GDP growth\n\n4.5*\n\nEuro area\n\n\u20131.6*\n\n2.0*\n\n\u20130.6*\n\nCoefficient of Taipei,China export growth\n\nlagged 1 period\n\nlagged 2 periods\n\nlagged 3 periods\n\n\u20130.3*\n\n\u20130.1\n\nJapan \n\n\u20130.3\n\nConstant\n\n\u201327.2*\n\n* = signi\ufb01cant at 5%.\nNotes: All values in nominal terms.

On the other hand, the correlation results \nshow that depreciation of the local dollar against the won increases \nPRC, US, and overall export orders (Table 3.13.3). \n\nHowever, this \ufb01nding should not be taken as evidence that \n\ndepreciation against the currencies of competing exporters, rather than \nagainst the currencies of export partners, can promote exports. Indeed, \nmonthly exchange rate data from January 2001 to December\u00a02015 \npoint to the futility of such a policy. During this period, local dollar \ndepreciation against the renminbi was accompanied half of the time by \nits appreciation against the won. This indicates that depreciation of the \nlocal dollar against the renminbi or the US dollar will likely be followed \nby larger depreciation of the won against the same currencies, rendering \nfutile any policy of promoting exports through currency depreciation.\n\nTo encourage export growth, Taipei,China should promote \n\ninnovations to move from price competition to value competition, and \nto differentiate its products from competing exporters. For example, \nfor\u00a0its semiconductor industry, it can move toward producing wafers \nand manufacturing equipment rather than importing them as inputs for \nits own exports, thus reducing production costs and helping to develop \nmore pro\ufb01table capital-intensive industries.\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3.13.7\u2002Exports by major commodity, 2014\n\n27\n84\n85 to the People\u2019s Republic of China\n85\n90\nOthers\n\nShare of exports, %\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nTaipei,China\n\n27 = mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their \ndistillation, bituminous substances, mineral waxes, \n84\u00a0=\u00a0nuclear reactors, boilers machinery and mechanical \nappliances, parts thereof, 85 = electrical machinery \nand equipment and parts thereof, sound recorders and \nreproducers, television image and sound recorders and \nreproducers, and parts and accessories of such articles, \n90 = optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, \nchecking, precision, medical or surgical instruments and \napparatus, parts and accessories thereof.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from Bureau of \nForeign\u00a0Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs, http://www.\ntrade.gov.tw; UN Comtrade International Trade Statistics \nDatabase SITC Revision 3, http://comtrade.un.org \n(both\u00a0accessed 1\u00a0March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.13.3\u2002Correlations between export orders and NT dollar depreciation against different currencies\n\nNT$/$\n\nNT$/CNY\n\nNT$/W\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\n\u2002\u20130.001\n\n\u2002 \u20130.146*\n\n\u2002 \u20130.269*\n\n\u2002 \u20130.249*\n\n\u2002\u2002\u20020.0250\n\n\u2002\u20130.086\n\n\u2002 \u20130.189*\n\n\u2002 \u20130.233*\n\n\u20020.132\n\n\u20130.170\n\n\u20130.443*\n\n\u20130.292*\n\n\u20020.129\n\n\u20130.136\n\n\u20130.393*\n\n\u20130.258*\n\nChange in\n\nTotal export orders\n\n\u2022Month on month\n\n\u2022Quarter on quarter\n\n\u2022Semester on semester\n\n\u2022Year on year\n\nUnited States export orders\n\n\u2022Month on month\n\n\u2022Quarter on quarter\n\n\u2022Semester on semester\n\n\u2022Year on year\n\n\u2022Month on month\n\n\u2022Quarter on quarter\n\n\u2022Semester on semester\n\n\u2022Year on year\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and Hong Kong, China export orders\n\n\u20130.037\n\n\u20130.180*\n\n\u20130.289*\n\n\u20130.306*\n\n\u20020.045\n\n\u20130.266*\n\n\u20130.480*\n\n\u20130.411*\n\n\u20130.065\n\n\u20130.192*\n\n\u20130.282*\n\n\u20130.270*\n\n\u20020.112\n\n\u20130.152\n\n\u20130.394*\n\n\u20130.363*\n\n0.082\n\n0.240*\n\n0.346*\n\n0.342*\n\n0.043\n\n0.162*\n\n0.246\n\n0.293*\n\n0.097\n\n0.239*\n\n0.346*\n\n0.370*\n\n\u20130.138\n\n0.331*\n\n0.425*\n\n0.424*\n\n\u20130.172\n\n0.207*\n\n0.309*\n\n0.399*\n\n\u20130.106\n\n0.331*\n\n0.402*\n\n0.435*\n\n* = signi\ufb01cant at 10% level, A = January 2001\u2013December 2015, B = January 2009\u2013December 2015. \n\n\fSOUTh ASIA\n\nAFghANISTAN\nBANgLADESh\nBhUTAN\nINDIA\nMALDIVES\nNEPAL\nPAKISTAN\nSrI LANKA\n\n\f\fAfghanistan \n\nThe  unity  government  formed  after  presidential  elections  in  2014  is  beset  by  an  escalation  in  the \ninsurgency  that  undermines  its  efforts  to  boost  growth  and  public  confidence  in  the  wake  of  the \n2014 withdrawal of international security forces. Growth edged up in 2015, and the outlook is for \na modest  pickup. Improved security, political cooperation, and donor support  are  required for the \neconomy  to  transition  to  a  sustainable  path.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth remained slow in 2015 as deteriorating security and \ncontinuing\u00a0political uncertainty sapped consumer and investor \ncon\ufb01dence. GDP\u00a0growth is provisionally estimated to have accelerated \nmarginally to 1.5% from 1.3% in 2014 (Figure 3.14.1). \n\nOn the supply side, agricultural output is estimated to have fallen \n\nby 2.0% with less favorable weather, but production has remained \nrelatively high since the record-breaking harvest in 2012. Growth in \nservices picked up slightly to 2.8% on marginally higher demand, while \nexpansion in industry slipped to 1.4% as investment dropped markedly \nand consumers spent less on manufactured goods. With the investment \nfalloff, private and government consumption now appear to account for \n85% of GDP. \n\nAfghanistan experienced mild de\ufb02ation in 2015, with consumer \nprices averaging 1.5% less than in 2014. Food prices averaged 1.9% \nlower and nonfood prices 1.2% lower, re\ufb02ecting weak domestic demand \nas well as declining global prices for fuel and other commodities. \nPrices\u00a0tended to recover after July, and by December the consumer \nprice index was 0.2% higher than in December 2014 (Figure 3.14.2). \n\nthan in 2014 and cutting the discretionary development budget by \nalmost half.

Growth \nin broad money declined to 5.7% from 8.3% in 2014. Increased private \ncapital out\ufb02ows in 2015, mostly accompanying a marked increase in \nemigration, put pressure on the foreign exchange market, resulting in a \n17% depreciation of the afghani against the US dollar and a $300 million \ndecline in gross international reserves to $7.0 billion (Figure 3.14.4).\n\nThe current account including official grants is estimated to have \nbeen a surplus equal to 4.5% of GDP in 2015, down from 6.4% in 2014 \n(Figure 3.14.5). The decline came with a 26.5% fall in exports of services \nmainly provided to international security forces, whose withdrawal \nwas completed at the end of 2014, taking many local jobs and markedly \nreducing national personal income. Excluding grants, the current \naccount is estimated to have recorded a de\ufb01cit equal to 41.7% of GDP, \nwidened from 37.8% in 2014. \n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic growth is projected to accelerate slightly to 2.0% in 2016 \nand 3.0% in 2017, assuming that security and political conditions \ndo\u00a0not deteriorate, planned donor support holds \ufb01rm, and the current \npositive trend of improved policy and governance reform continues. \nRaising\u00a0investor con\ufb01dence depends on improving the security and \nbusiness environment, especially for the extractive industry, and \nstrengthening governance and the rule of law. If the government \nimplements measures to improve governance, moderate growth in \nindustry and services is projected to the forecast horizon. Growth in \nagriculture, on the other hand, is forecast to remain \ufb02at in 2016 with \nunfavorable weather but likely to improve in 2017. \n\nFiscal policy will continue to focus on boosting revenue collection \nby at least 1% of GDP per annum, as well as on improving the execution \nof the development budget through reforms that strengthen policy and \ngovernance and build capacity. The overall \ufb01scal position including \ngrants is forecast to be about balanced, with no borrowing, in the \nforecast period as expected donor grants will supplement domestic \nrevenue to fully fund recurrent and development expenditure \nrequirements. The\u00a0ratio of domestic revenues to recurrent spending is \nprojected to improve to 47.1% in 2017 from 43.9% in 2014. \n\nHeadline in\ufb02ation is forecast to be 3.0% in 2016 and 3.5% in 2017, \nbased on Asian Development Outlook baseline assumptions and prudent \n\ufb01scal and monetary policies.

Since 2012, the \ufb01scal gap has been \nwidening as growth in domestic revenues lagged rising expenditure, \nin large part because of markedly slower economic growth and also \nbecause of lapses in governance (Figure 3.14.6). Public spending is rising \nbecause of larger security expenditures following the withdrawal of \ninternational forces, necessary increases in social bene\ufb01t spending, \nand higher outlays for operations and maintenance as donors transfer \ncompleted projects to the government. Nevertheless, Afghanistan \nmust reduce its heavy dependence on foreign aid, as set out in the \ngovernment\u2019s plan for its \u201ctransformation decade\u201d from 2015 to 2024. \nAt the least, this means fully \ufb01nancing operating expenditures from \ndomestic revenues. If progress is not made toward improving revenue \nperformance, budget de\ufb01cits and public debt will rise, the delivery of \nessential public services will come under pressure, and donor fatigue \nwill set in. \n\nIn 2015, the government took signi\ufb01cant steps to improve revenue \n\ncollection: doubling the tax on business receipts to 4% from 2%, \nintroducing a 10% tax on mobile phone top-ups, increasing the fuel fee \nfrom AF1 to AF2 per liter, and raising fees for international airlines \nover\ufb02ying national air space. As a result, domestic revenue grew by 22%. \nMoreover, the government began implementing broad reforms set out in \nagreements with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank-\nadministered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. \n\nexpenditures increasing faster than domestic revenues under the \nexisting tax system. Revenues need to be boosted by expanding the \nrates and coverage of excise and property taxes, minimizing substantial \ntax exemptions, improving taxpayer compliance and enforcement, \nand stemming leakage. In particular, Parliament needs to approve \nthe long-delayed value-added tax law as quickly as possible to replace \nthe business receipts tax and institute a major source of revenue. \nThe\u00a0government also needs to develop a taxation structure and revenue-\nsharing framework speci\ufb01cally for the extractive industry. The sector \nenjoys investor interest and high potential for revenue generation \nif\u00a0de\ufb01ciencies in security and essential infrastructure are successfully \naddressed.\n\nSteps can be taken on the expenditure side as well to narrow the \n\ufb01scal\u00a0gap. The execution of the development budget should be improved \nto accelerate the development of new infrastructure that will drive \nprivate investment and spur growth that can enlarge the tax base, create \njobs, and reduce poverty. In addition, savings can come from improved \ntransparency and accountability in the use of public funds achieved \nthrough efficient budget and expenditure management.\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221250\n\n \nAF billion\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n3.14.5\u2002Current account balance\n\nExcluding official grants\nIncluding official grants\n\n \n% of GDP\n\n3.2\n\n3.9\n\n7.4\n\n6.4\n\n4.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u20130.7\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 21 December of the \nsame calendar year.\nSources: World Bank, Afghanistan Economic Update; \nInternational Monetary Fund Country Report No. 15/324, \nNovember 2015 for 2013\u20132017; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 21 December of the \nsame calendar year.\nSources: World Bank, Afghanistan Economic Update; \nInternational Monetary Fund Country Report No. 15/324, \nNovember 2015 for 2015\u20132017; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nProjections over the medium term, however, show government \n\n3.14.6\u2002Fiscal sustainability indicators\n\nDomestic revenues\nCurrent expenditures\n\nRevenue as %\nof expenditure\n\n\fBangladesh\n\nGrowth  was  resilient  in  FY2015  despite  political  protest  that  hindered  exports  and  private \ninvestment. Global headwinds notwithstanding, growth is expected to edge up in the next 2 years \non  steady  expansion  in  garment  exports.  The  goal  of  graduating  from  low-  to  middle-income \nstatus requires much higher investment and thorough reform to improve the business environment, \nboost  budget  revenue,  and  strengthen  financial  discipline.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth in FY2015 (ended 30 June 2015) picked up to 6.6% from \n6.1% in FY2014 despite a short period of political protest at midyear \nthat disrupted transportation and services (Figure 3.15.1). Growth in \nagriculture moderated to 3.3% from 4.4% a year earlier because harvests \nof staple and horticultural crops were less favorable. Meanwhile, \nrobust domestic demand pushed industry expansion to 9.7% from 8.2% \nthe previous year, led by manufacturing for the domestic market and \nconstruction. Services growth advanced slightly to 5.8% from 5.6%.\n\nOn the demand side, the main contributor to growth was private \nconsumption boosted by higher remittances. Net exports subtracted \nfrom growth as exports grew more slowly than imports. Investment \nrose only marginally to 28.9% of GDP in FY2015 from 28.6% the \nprevious year, mostly on increased public investment. Private investment \nremained stagnant owing to investor caution, infrastructure and skill \nshortages, and a weak business environment. Foreign direct investment \nremains below 1.0% of GDP and 3.0% of total investment.\n\nAverage in\ufb02ation moderated to 6.4% in FY2015 from 7.4% a year \nearlier, largely in response to lower global prices for food and other \ncommodities (Figure 3.15.2). Year-on-year in\ufb02ation eased throughout \nthe year to end at 6.3% in June 2015, down from 7.0% a year earlier. \nFood\u00a0in\ufb02ation decelerated to 6.3% from 8.0%, while nonfood in\ufb02ation \nedged up to 6.2% from 5.5%. Food in\ufb02ation subsequently fell to 3.8% \nyear on year in February 2016 on bountiful seasonal supplies, while \nnonfood in\ufb02ation spiked to 8.5% on increases in administered prices for \nnatural gas and electricity. These divergent trends offset each other to \nleave overall in\ufb02ation hovering at just below 6%. \n\nGrowth in broad money supply slowed in FY2015 mainly as net \n\ncredit to the government fell and expansion in net foreign assets \ndecelerated. Broad money growth was, at 12.4%, lower than the FY2015 \nmonetary program target of 16.5% (Figure 3.15.3). Private credit growth \nwas also below the program target, at 13.2% versus 15.5%, as uncertainty \nheld back demand for investment loans.

As in\ufb02ation remained above its target, Bangladesh Bank, the \ncentral bank, kept the main policy (repo) rate unchanged. The average \nyield on 91-day Treasury bills declined to 5.4% in June 2015 from \n6.9% a year earlier. Banks\u2019 weighted average interest rate for lending \ndeclined to 11.7% in June 2015 from 13.1% a year earlier as the deposit \ninterest rate fell to 6.8% from 7.7%, narrowing banks\u2019 rate spread by \n0.5\u00a0percentage points to 4.9%. \n\nNational Board of Revenue tax collection grew by 13.2% in FY2015, \n\nunderperforming the budget target, particularly for income taxes \nbecause of subdued economic activity together with delayed reforms in \nrevenue collection. The collection of nontax revenues was also weaker \nthan expected because pro\ufb01t transfers from state-owned enterprises \ndisappointed. Although social spending was maintained as budgeted, \noverall spending was under budget as fuel subsidy requirements and \npublic investment were both lower than expected. As a share of GDP, \nrevenue fell to 9.6% from 10.4% a year earlier, while spending slipped \nto 13.9% from 14.0%, holding the budget de\ufb01cit to 4.3% (Figure 3.15.4). \nThree-quarters of the de\ufb01cit was \ufb01nanced domestically, entirely from \nnonbank sources as demand for national savings certi\ufb01cates ballooned, \ntheir rates highly attractive as bank deposit rates fell.\n\nExports grew by only 3.3% in FY2015, down from 12.1% a year \nearlier. Disruption to production early in 2015 from political protest, \nweak demand from leading export destinations, and unfavorable \nexchange rate movements against the euro helped keep expansion tepid. \nGarments, which accounted for 81.7% of exports, grew by only 4.1%, \ndown from 13.8%. Import growth accelerated from 8.9% in FY2014 to \n11.2% on higher demand for capital goods, food grains, industrial raw \nmaterials, and petroleum products, expanding the trade de\ufb01cit to $9.9 \nbillion. Workers abroad remitted $15.3 billion as greater employment \noverseas pushed remittances 7.7% higher than a year earlier. \n\nDespite the pickup in workers\u2019 remittances, the current account \n\nsuffered as higher de\ufb01cits in trade, services, and primary income \nreversed it to a de\ufb01cit of $1.6 billion, equal to 0.8% of GDP, from the \nsurplus of $1.4 billion recorded in FY2014 (Figure 3.15.5). The combined \ncapital and \ufb01nancial accounts recorded a large surplus of $5.6 billion in \nFY2015, up from $3.4 billion in FY2014 because of a larger increase in \nnet trade credit. However, the current account de\ufb01cit pushed the overall \nbalance of payments to a lower surplus of $4.4 billion from $5.5 billion \nin FY2014. The surplus lifted the central bank\u2019s gross foreign exchange \nreserves to $25.0 billion including valuation adjustments, or cover for \n6.2 months of imports, by the end of June 2015 from $21.5 billion a year \nearlier (Figure\u00a03.15.6). \n\nThe central bank\u2019s active exchange rate management kept the \nBangladesh taka stable against the dollar, depreciating by only 0.2% in \nFY2015. However, trade partners\u2019 greater currency depreciation against \nthe dollar and lower domestic in\ufb02ation pushed the taka up in real \neffective terms by 14.0% year on year during the \ufb01scal year, indicating \nsome loss of export competitiveness (Figure 3.15.7).\n\n3.15.3\u2002Monetary indicators\n\nBroad money\nNet credit to government\nCredit to private sector\n \n\n% change, year on year\n\n  Jan \n2014\n\n  Jan \n2015\n\nDec \n\nSource: Bangladesh Bank. 2016.

The capital market is becoming more stable and transparent \nas regulations are strengthened and demutualization progresses with \nthe separation of trading rights from ownership and management in the \nDhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is expected to inch up to 6.7% in FY2016, underpinned by \nstronger garment exports and rising private consumption as government \nemployees get wage increases (Figure 3.15.9). Despite macroeconomic \nstability, domestic demand remains restrained by consumer and investor \ncaution. This is re\ufb02ected in slower private credit growth, a decline in \nconsumer and capital goods imports, and slow tax revenue collection in \nthe \ufb01rst half of FY2016. Growth is expected to rise to 6.9% in FY2017, \naided by higher remittance and export growth as the US and the euro area \neconomies strengthen. Domestic political calm is seen to build con\ufb01dence \nin consumers and investors and so support growth momentum.\n\nAgriculture is expected to be little changed, growing at 3.2% in \nFY2016. Rising demand for agricultural products other than traditional \ncrops\u2014and improved infrastructure, connectivity, and marketing \nfacilities\u2014are projected to edge sector growth up to 3.4% in FY2017.\nIndustry is expected to expand slightly faster at 9.8% in FY2016. \nThough export growth is forecasted to rise, it will be partly offset by \nslackening consumer demand caused by a slowing of remittance growth. \nIndustry will likely grow by 10.0% in FY2017 with a pickup in domestic \nand external demand, better safety standards and compliance in garment \nfactories, some gains in electricity supply and infrastructure availability, \nand improved business con\ufb01dence.\n\nServices growth is projected to improve a bit to 5.9% in FY2016 as \nindustry expands. With a pickup in external trade and domestic demand, \nservices growth is projected to rise further to 6.1% in FY2017.\n\ndespite an increase in public sector wages early in the \ufb01scal year \n(Figure\u00a03.15.10). Global fuel and commodity prices are expected to \ndecline, the crop outlook is broadly favorable, and the central bank will \nfollow prudent monetary policy without hampering output growth. \nAlthough nonfood in\ufb02ation is on the rise, driven by higher wages \nand upward adjustments to administered prices of natural gas and \nelectricity, continuing low food in\ufb02ation will keep overall in\ufb02ation in \ncheck. In\ufb02ation\u00a0decelerated to 5.6% year on year in February 2016 from \n6.1% a year earlier as food in\ufb02ation declined to 3.8% from 6.1% and \nnonfood in\ufb02ation rose to 8.5% from 6.2%.

In a bid to further \nease market interest rates and stimulate investment, the central bank \nlowered in January 2016 its main policy rates by 50 basis points, \ntaking the repurchase rate to 6.75% and the reverse repurchase rate \nto 4.75% (Figure 3.15.11). In view of prevailing excess bank liquidity, \nand to meet competition from private banks, seven state-owned banks \njointly decided to lower lending rates by 1.5\u20132.0 percentage points from \nFebruary 2016.\n\nExports grew by 8.9% in the \ufb01rst 8 months of FY2016, signi\ufb01cantly \nup from 2.4% growth in the corresponding period of FY2015 as garment \nexports grew by 9.5%. This re\ufb02ects in part improved safety standards \nand worker rights in the garment industry, which major buyers \ndemanded following fatal factory collapses with severe loss of lives in \n2012 and 2013. With a stable political environment, export growth is \nexpected to be 8.0% in FY2016, markedly better than the 3.3% recorded \nin FY2015. Export growth is projected to accelerate further to 9.0% in \nFY2017 (Figure 3.15.12).\n\nImports rose by 7.0% in July\u2013December 2015 as higher imports \nof chemicals, crude oil, pharmaceuticals, and raw materials for the \ngarment industry were only partly offset by declining imports of food \ngrains, sugar, fertilizer, and capital equipment. Imports are expected \nto pickup in the second half to grow by 9.0% in FY2016. Imports are \nexpected to increase by 11.0% in FY2017.\n\nWorkers\u2019 remittances declined by 1.5% to $9.8 billion in the \ufb01rst \n\n8 months of FY2016, re\ufb02ecting stagnant wages and taka appreciation \nagainst host currencies. Overseas jobs for Bangladeshi workers surged by \n55.7% in the \ufb01rst 8 months of FY2016 (Figure 3.15.13). This\u00a0foreshadows \nin the following months a likely rise in remittances, which are expected \nto grow by 5.0% in FY2016 and a further 7.0% in FY2017. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is expected to improve slightly to \n0.5% of GDP in FY2016 with a narrower trade de\ufb01cit (Figure 3.15.14). \nHowever,\u00a0the current account de\ufb01cit is projected to widen to 1.0% of \nGDP in FY2017 as remittance in\ufb02ows will not suffice to offset the larger \ntrade gap that is projected.\n\nThe FY2016 budget targets 29.5% growth in tax revenue and \n23.1% growth in total spending, including current spending and the \nannual development program. Achieving these large increases will \nbe challenging, so shortfalls are likely on both sides of the ledger. \nDevelopments in the early months of FY2016 indicate that revenue as a \nshare of GDP increased to 10.3%, while public spending rose to 15.0%. \nThe projected \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is, at 4.7% of GDP, slightly higher than the \n4.3% outcome in FY2015. Just over 70% of the de\ufb01cit is expected to be \n\ufb01nanced from domestic sources\u2014again mostly not from banks.\n\nLike other net oil-importing countries, Bangladesh enjoyed a \nwindfall gain from lower global oil prices. Visible impacts are in the \ntrade balance and in lower subsidy costs to the budget. The authorities\u2019 \nmaintenance of retail fuel prices enabled the Bangladesh Petroleum \nCorporation to earn healthy operating pro\ufb01ts and recoup some of its \nlarge past losses.

Debt as a percentage of GDP continued to improve in \nFY2015. Central government debt declined to 27.2% of GDP in FY2015 \nfrom 29.1% in FY2014 as the ratio of external debt to GDP continued its \nsteady decline (Figure 3.15.15). The government\u2019s prudent decisions on \nborrowing from external sources were re\ufb02ected as external debt stepped \ndown annually to reach 12.0% of GDP in FY2015, for which the external \ndebt service ratio is 2.3%. Domestic debt rose slightly to 15.2% of GDP in \nFY2015 from 15.0% in FY2014 as the sale of national savings certi\ufb01cates \nto the public expanded to cover a shortfall in revenue collection. The \naverage interest paid on domestic debt is 10.6%.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014promoting investment \nand\u00a0growth\nThe Seventh Five-Year Plan aims to achieve 8% GDP growth and scale \nup investment from the equivalent of 29% of GDP to 35% by FY2020. \nAs\u00a0in\u00a0the past, momentum has to come from private investment. \nIndicative growth scenarios suggest that private investment needs to \nrise from 22% of GDP to at least 27%. However, it will be a challenge to \nachieve an increase in the private investment rate in the next 5\u00a0years \nthat is equal to 5 percentage points of GDP, especially in view of stagnant \nprivate investment over the past 5 years. Despite a very favorable \nmacroeconomic performance and political calm prevailing since the \nsecond quarter of 2015, investor con\ufb01dence remains subdued. \n\nTo boost private investment it is necessary to address three binding \n\nconstraints by improving electricity and gas supply, easing problems \nin property acquisition and registration, and strengthening logistics. \nAdditionally, policy focus is required on resolving insolvency and \nlowering the cost of trading across borders. Bangladesh needs real \nprogress toward greatly cutting the cost of doing business to boost \nprivate and foreign investment. It ranks 174 among 189 countries \nsurveyed in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2016\u2014well below India \nat 130, Pakistan at 138, and Sri Lanka at 107. Streamlined tax payment \nprocedures, improved access to credit, and better contract enforcement \nare priorities. \n\nHigh transaction costs caused by inadequate supply of electricity and \n\ngas badly constrain investment and growth. Despite considerable new \ninvestment in power generation, getting electricity connections for new \nbusinesses is a challenge, according to surveys. Addressing the problem \nrequires that regulatory procedures be further simpli\ufb01ed by reducing \ntheir number and application response times. Capacity enhancement \nis critical to enable response to new requests for electricity and gas \nconnections in the required volume and at lower cost. This will require \nsubstantial public investment and an effective strategy for primary \nenergy supply in the medium term.\n\nLong delays and the high cost of obtaining and registering \nland frustrate private investment, especially in manufacturing. \n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n-40\n\n3.15.11\u2002Interest rates\n\n91-day Treasury bill\nRepo\nReverse repo\nLending\nDeposit\n\nMar\n2014\n\nSep\n\nSep\n\nDec\n\nMar\n2015\n\nSource: Bangladesh Bank. 2016.

The government has started digitizing land \nrecords in an initiative that needs to be scaled up and out across the \ncountry. Meanwhile, population pressure and rapid urbanization have \nmade urban land increasingly hard to acquire. As land prices have \nskyrocketed, so have land disputes and various forms of corruption \nincluding land grabbing. The challenge for policy makers is acute, and \nit\u00a0will take time and effort to simplify land transactions and registration \nthrough regulatory reform, improve land administration and record \nkeeping through institutional reform, establish economic zones for \nprivate investors both domestic and foreign, and improve mechanisms to \nenforce zoning laws on land use.\n\nThe authorities must also address weak trade logistics and the \nlong delays to trade transactions and associated costs that they cause. \nMuch\u00a0of the problem lies in getting goods from the factory gate to the \nport. Handling capacity at Chittagong port has improved, and port \nhandling charges are now less of a concern. However, road and railway \nnetworks need their capacity enhanced in line with rising transport \ndemand to capitalize on such gains.\n\nMore generally, boosting investment and sustaining growth \nmomentum as Bangladesh approaches middle-income status require \ndeep policy reform and strengthened institutions. Ensuring easier access \nto \ufb01nance depends on a healthy banking sector with enhanced capital \nadequacy and fewer nonperforming loans. Continuing reform to the \ncapital and insurance markets needs to be accelerated in tandem with \nregulatory strengthening to provide long-term loans for investment. \nImport tariff reform, stalled for the past 2 decades, must be tackled \nto enhance the economy\u2019s competitiveness. Revenue collection in \nBangladesh is low even compared with other South Asian economies \nand must be markedly improved to provide resources for investment in \ninfrastructure and social development. Operationalizing the new value-\nadded tax is an essential \ufb01rst step toward signi\ufb01cantly better revenue \nmobilization. Likewise, rationalizing energy and power subsidies is \nessential to improve \ufb01scal \ufb02exibility.

The outlook is for moderately higher growth from new \nhydropower  output,  strong  domestic  demand,  and  strengthened  fiscal  programs  for  economic \ndiversification  and  small  enterprise  development.  Strategies  to  enhance  education  and  labor  skills \nthat  are  more  attuned  to  economic  demands  will  help  make  growth  in  Bhutan  more  inclusive.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth quickened to an estimated 5.9% in FY2015 (ended 30 June\u00a02015) \nafter slowing in recent years as domestic demand faltered under \nimport and credit restrictions imposed to alleviate shortages of Indian \nrupee reserves. With the restrictions lifted in September 2014 and \nhydropower construction back on track following an earlier delay, \ngross\u00a0\ufb01xed\u00a0investment strongly recovered, and imports of machinery \nand equipment markedly pick up. \n\nOn the production side, services and industry both accelerated \n(Figure 3.16.1). Faster growth in the service sector was broad based, \nled by the revival in wholesale trade and \ufb01nancial activities. Hotels \nand transport gained from double-digit growth in tourist arrivals, \nwhile socioeconomic services rose from increased public spending. \nIndustrial\u00a0growth advanced on a robust pickup in construction and \nimport-related manufacturing. Agriculture also grew, bene\ufb01tting from \ncontinuing government programs to enhance production.\n\n Despite robust demand, in\ufb02ation slowed markedly throughout the \nyear as prices fell for both domestic and imported food, which together \ncomprise 40% of the consumption basket (Figure 3.16.2). Bhutan\u2019s prices \nbroadly follow movements in India\u2019s market prices, as most goods are \nimported from India and the Bhutanese ngultrum is pegged one-to-one \nto the Indian rupee. Domestic in\ufb02ationary pressures were subdued by \nimproved harvests and lower housing and transport costs courtesy of \ndeclining world oil prices. Average in\ufb02ation eased to 6.6% in FY2015 \nfrom 9.6% in the previous year.\n\nGovernment expenditure (excluding net lending) grew by 18.1%, \n\nrising by 1.2 percentage points as a share of GDP (Figure 3.16.3). \nIn\u00a0line\u00a0with the goal in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, FY2013\u20132018 of \nmaking growth more inclusive and diversi\ufb01ed, spending supported \ncrop and livestock production, infrastructure improvement, and the \ndevelopment of priority sectors.

The overall \ufb01scal balance turned \nto a de\ufb01cit of Nu2.8\u00a0billion, equal to 2.2% of GDP. \n\nThe Royal Monetary Authority introduced new macro-prudential \n\nregulations to improve monetary management and, early in FY2015, \nwithdrew the foreign exchange and credit restrictions. With liquidity \nand credit building up, the cash reserve ratio was raised from 5% to 10% \nin March 2015, and the base rate for bank lending was revised up from \n10.32% to 10.49% in May 2015. Priority sectors remained exempted from \nthe base rating system to steer credit to them. By\u00a0the end of FY2015, \nmoney supply had grown by 7.8%, well below the 26.0% monthly peak \nthat \ufb01scal year but outpacing the 6.6% recorded in the previous year \n(Figure\u00a03.16.4). Credit to the private sector rose by 13.8% by the end \nof FY2015, double the expansion rate in FY2014, as credit growth in \nconstruction markedly quickened. Credit increased as well in trade and \ncommerce\u2014and to an extent in agriculture\u2014supported by low lending \nrates for priority\u00a0sectors.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit remained high at the equivalent of 28.2% \n\nof GDP, up slightly from 26.4% in FY2014 (Figure 3.16.5). The rise was \nmainly from higher hydropower interest payments, which drove up \nthe primary income de\ufb01cit. The trade de\ufb01cit, though still high on large \nhydropower-related imports and robust consumption, narrowed slightly \nto 20.3% of GDP owing to higher exports of hydropower and mineral-\nbased construction goods, as well as moderating prices for imports \nfrom\u00a0India. \n\nAs net capital and \ufb01nancial \ufb02ows could not offset the current \naccount de\ufb01cit, gross official reserves fell slightly by $39 million to \n$959 million, equal to nearly 10 months of imports and well above \nthe conventional benchmark of 3 months (Figure 3.16.6). The share of \nIndian\u00a0rupee reserves, at about 18% of the total, remained adequate for \ncross-border payments. \n\nBhutan\u2019s external debt rose by $96 million to $1.85 billion in FY2015 \n\non continued hydropower construction, and despite lower debts \nfrom the short-term line of credit, but fell as a share of GDP to 90% \n(Figure\u00a03.16.7). The debt service ratio improved with the increase in \nexport value. As most debt is for hydropower with large economic gains \nexpected in the future, the International Monetary Fund estimates the \nrisk of debt distress to be only moderate. \n\nEconomic prospects\nIndustry growth is expected to strengthen moderately in FY2016 as \nelectricity output increases with the year-round operation of the new \nDagachhu hydropower station, while construction of the new Nikachhu \nhydropower station will supplement ongoing investment. Manufacturing \ngrowth is expected to remain strong on robust demand for construction-\nrelated goods\u2014iron, steel, and cement\u2014for export and domestic use. \nIndustry growth will ease slightly in FY2017 on base effects and because \nno new hydropower capacity is expected until at least 2018. \n\nThe service sector is projected to maintain momentum in FY2016 \n\non robust domestic demand that will bene\ufb01t retail trade, hotels and \nrestaurants, and \ufb01nance, and on strengthened wholesale trade supporting \n\n3.16.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n2016\n\n\u2002\u20026.4\n\n\u2002\u20024.0\n\n\u201328.8\n\n2017\n\n\u2002\u20026.1\n\n\u2002\u20025.0\n\n\u201327.0\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of \nthat\u00a0year.\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.16.3\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nDomestic revenue\nGrants\nRecurrent expenditure\nCapital expenditure\nFiscal de\ufb01cit\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: National Budget Financial Year 2015/16.

The strength and quality of the workforce \ndepends on its educational attainment and acquisition of the knowledge \nand skills needed for productive employment. As the economy has \nrapidly transformed over the decades from agriculture toward \nhydropower and services, it needs a strong workforce that responds to \nthe demand from the growing sectors. Interventions will be challenged \nby low educational attainment, skills shortages and mismatch with labor \ndemand, and employment disparity by region, gender, and age. \n\neducation, which is higher than the regional average of 3.5%. Despite \nthis high investment, considerable gaps remain in the country\u2019s \neducational achievement. Nationally, average years of schooling is \nvery low by regional standards (Figure 3.16.8), with only 34% of \nthe population at least 15 years old achieving at least a secondary \neducation. Adult and youth literacy rates are the lowest in South Asia \n(Figure\u00a03.16.9). Although primary school enrolment rates are high, many \nstudents do not continue to secondary and tertiary school, as access \nis limited and unequal because of high costs and a lack of higher-level \nschools, especially in rural areas. Some of those who leave school enter \nvocational training, but most work in low income-earning agriculture.\n\nAmong students that reach the tertiary level, 70% major in language, \n\nbusiness, or commerce.

Notwithstanding  unexpected  delays  in  enacting  some  economic \nreform,  the  prospects  for  continued  rapid  growth  are  undiminished.\n\nEconomic performance \nAdvance government estimates point to the economy growing at 7.6% in \nFY2015 (ending 31 March 2016), marginally above the forecast of 7.4% \nin Asian Development Outlook 2015 Update. The estimate could be a tad \noptimistic, however, as achieving it would require GDP to increase by \n7.7% in the last quarter of the \ufb01scal year (Figure 3.17.1). \n\nDespite a weak monsoon for a second consecutive year, \nagriculture\u00a0grew by 1.1% in FY2015, mainly on strong growth in \nlivestock. Food\u00a0grain production is estimated to have increased by 0.5% \nin FY2015, though there was lower production of rice, coarse cereals, \noilseeds, and\u00a0sugarcane.\n\nAfter growing by 5.9% in FY2014, industry accelerated further to \n7.3% in FY2015. Manufacturing growth rebounded to 9.5% with the \naid of robust performance in the manufacturing operations of private \ncorporations, whose margins have been inching up with lower input \ncosts. Strong growth in manufacturing as measured by value added \ncontinues to be at variance with anemic growth in industrial production, \nwhich measures volume.

Government \nconsumption growth also stayed tepid as the central government \nboosted capital expenditure and curtailed current expenditure. A 20.9% \nincrease in capital expenditure undertaken by the central government \nhelped investment growth improve to 5.3% from 4.9% in FY2014. \nHowever, private investment remained weakened by overcapacity and \nIndian corporations\u2019 debt overhang. \n\nIn\ufb02ation has stayed subdued, averaging 5.0% in FY2015 (Figure\u00a03.17.3). \n\nDespite\u00a02\u00a0years with weak monsoons, food in\ufb02ation continues to trend \nlow, though it picked up in the second half of the year on higher prices \nfor selected products such as pulses, onions, and sugar. The\u00a0easing of food \nin\ufb02ation overall was helped by lower global commodity prices, restrained \nincreases in domestic procurement prices, and improved management \nof government food stocks. Despite soft global prices for crude oil, \nfuel in\ufb02ation inched up to 5.5% from 4.1% in FY2014. The\u00a0uptick came \nprimarily from higher fuel in\ufb02ation in rural areas, which commonly \nuse domestically produced fuel such as \ufb01rewood and biogas that are not \naffected by low oil prices. Even in urban areas, the decline in oil prices \nwas only partly passed through to retail prices, as\u00a0taxes were increased to \nbolster government revenues. After declining by nearly 300 basis points in \nFY2014, core in\ufb02ation has remained relatively sticky, staying within the \nnarrow range of 4.1% to 4.8% in FY2015, indicating entrenched in\ufb02ation \nexpectations. \n\nDespite in\ufb02ation declining by nearly 500 basis points from its peak \n\nin late 2013, key policy rates were reduced by a cumulative 125\u00a0basis \npoints: 75 basis points in the last quarter of FY2014 followed by 50\u00a0basis \npoints in September 2015 (Figure 3.17.4). Such calibrated policy rate \nreduction re\ufb02ected concern about the prospect of the US Federal Reserve \nincreasing interest rates and the resulting volatility in global \ufb01nancial \nmarkets, sharp price increases for some food products, and possibility of \ndeviation from the path of \ufb01scal consolidation.\n\nBank credit growth averaged less than 10% in FY2015 as falling \nin\ufb02ation lowered \ufb01rms\u2019 input costs and thereby reduced their working \ncapital requirements, and as \ufb01rms increased their use of nonbank \n\ufb01nancing (Figure 3.17.5). Banks\u2019 limited pass-through of cuts in policy \nrates meant the cost of funds fell only slowly, prompting \ufb01rms to shift \nto other instruments such as corporate bonds and commercial paper, for \nwhich interest rates fell much more steeply. Moreover, a surge in foreign \ndirect investment, low global interest rates, and ready access to credit \nallowed companies to source foreign funds at lower cost. \n\nWeak balance sheets at public banks, which account for 70% of \n\nbank lending, continue to pose risks for economic growth as they \nlimit banks\u2019 ability to fund investment. The ratio of nonperforming \nassets to total advances deteriorated from 4.6% in March 2015 to 5.1% \nin September 2015, though restructured loans declined a bit to 6.2% \nfrom 6.4%.

The reduction came through curtailed current \nexpenditure and through tax revenue growth that exceeded the target. \nWhile corporate and personal income tax collection fell short of their \ntargets, revenue from excise duties and taxes on services grew faster \nthan planned, helped by hikes in excise duties on petroleum products. \nDespite receipts from planned asset sales falling well below their target, \nnontax revenue registered healthy growth at over 30% as public sector \nenterprises, including public banks, paid higher dividends.\n\nbudgeted growth at 6.8%. Unlike in previous years, capital expenditure \ngrew robustly, by 20.9%, such that the ratio of capital expenditure to \nGDP rose to 1.8% in FY2015.

The sharp drop in global oil prices, deregulation \nof diesel prices, and use of cash transfers to quali\ufb01ed recipients to \nrationalize the subsidized cooking gas bene\ufb01t cut expenditures on the \npetroleum subsidy by more than half. However, there was an uptick in \nthe outgo on account of fertilizer and food subsidies.\n\nA national commission that reviews the salaries of the central \ngovernment employees every decade recommended a 23.5% increase \nin salaries and pensions. According to the commission, the wage \nrevision would cost the central government budget the equivalent of \n0.46% of GDP.

With the price of \nimported crude oil declining by more than half in the course of FY2015, \noil imports fell by more than 40% even as volume picked up by 8% \nover the previous year. Gold imports increased by 2.6%, despite lower \nprices, as import volumes registered a marked gain of 21.4% during \nthe year. At the same time, imports other than oil and gold stabilized \nas consumption goods such as electronics and readymade garments \nregistered growth, indicating improved domestic consumption demand. \nHowever, imports of capital goods such as machinery, transport \nequipment, and iron and steel remained weak. \n\nLower commodity prices and anemic global demand weighed on \n\nexports, which contracted by 18.0% in FY2015. While lower oil prices \nbrought re\ufb01ned petroleum exports down by more than half, non-oil \nexports also declined by 9.4%. Exports of key products including \nengineering goods, electronics, leather, textiles, and gems and jewelry \ncontracted as demand weakened in the advanced economies, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, and oil-producing nations.

These in\ufb02ows and \ncontinuing business and government loan in\ufb02ows increased gross \ninternational reserves in FY2015 by $9.2 billion to over $350 billion \n(Figure 3.17.9). \n\nPortfolio \ufb02ows turned negative during the year with estimated \nnet out\ufb02ows of $3.7 billion from the equity market and $0.7 billion in \ndebt, in line with the experience of other emerging markets. The selloff \nre\ufb02ected concerns about interest rates rising in the US, the economic \nslowdown in key emerging markets, and slower-than-anticipated \nprogress on politically difficult domestic economic reforms. The out\ufb02ow \nfrom the equity market was a factor pushing stock prices on the Bombay \nStock Exchange Sensex down by 13% over the year (Figure 3.17.10). \n\nThe Indian rupee depreciated by 8% against the US dollar in FY2015. \n\nHowever, it weakened in nominal effective terms by a smaller 5%, and \nin real effective terms by less than 3%, implying that it moved in parallel \nwith the currencies of trading partners (Figure 3.17.11).\n\nEconomic prospects\nWhile public investment and urban consumption were the major \ndrivers of growth in FY2015, a revival of private investment and rural \nconsumption is critical if growth is to remain strong in FY2016 and \nFY2017, given the likely sluggish recovery in the advanced economies \nand the anemic outlook for global trade. Urban consumption is \nexpected to receive a boost from the impending salary hike for \ngovernment employees in 2016. That salary hike is likely a factor in \npushing private\u00a0sector wages somewhat higher. However, reviving \nrural consumption will hinge on the quality of the monsoon, as a major \npart of the rural economy continues to depend heavily on agriculture. \nNevertheless, budgetary support for programs to improve agricultural \nproductivity and funding for the government employment scheme for \npoor rural families should boost rural incomes and spending.\n\nPublic investment will continue to be an important driver of growth, \n\nas the government is expected to use savings from oil to further boost \ngovernment investment. However, the \ufb01nances available to ramp up \ninvestment in FY2016 will be considerably smaller than in FY2015, \ngiven sharper \ufb01scal tightening and increased outgo on account of a \nhigher public sector wage bill. New investment announcements are \njust beginning to recover and inch higher (Figure\u00a03.17.12). While the \nnumber of stalled projects has declined marginally, it remains elevated. \nOngoing\u00a0deleveraging by private corporations, reductions in policy \nrates, and public investment are likely to initiate a recovery in private \ninvestment. Further, the uptick in consumption could soak up excess \ncapacity across sectors and invite fresh investment. \n\n$ billion\n\n \n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n350\n\n250\n\n150\n\n50\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.10\u2002Stock price indexes\n\nSensex\nMSCI ACAP excluding Japan\nEmerging markets excluding Asia\n\nIndex, 2009 = 100\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 26 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.11\u2002Exchange rate\n\nReal effective \nNominal effective \n\nIndex, 2010 = 100\n\nNominal\n\nRs/$\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 15 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fVarious investment outlook surveys provide a mixed picture. \n\n3.17.12\u2002New investment projects announced \n\n168\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nThe\u00a0manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index declined for \n6\u00a0consecutive months to December but turned higher in January and \nFebruary 2016 on new orders and exports (Figure 3.17.13). The services \nindex has been more robust, reaching a 21-month high in January \nbut then falling in February on a marginal increase in output. At the \nsame\u00a0time, Nomura\u2019s index of composite leading indicators shows \ngrowth momentum stabilizing, while the central bank\u2019s industrial \noutlook survey points to strengthening business sentiment. \n\nA normal monsoon would augur well for growth in agriculture, \n\nwhich has been depressed by weak rains in the past 2 years. \nThe\u00a0slowdown in advanced economies including the US, lower export \ncommodity prices, and weaker currencies in some major trading partners \nvis-\u00e0-vis the Indian rupee are likely to hit merchandise exports and \n\ufb01nancial, telecom, business, and other tradeable services. Lower net \nexports could thus impinge on growth.\n\nLimited policy headroom exists to bolster growth, given pressures \n\nfrom an uptick in in\ufb02ation and plans for further \ufb01scal consolidation. \nHowever, with new guidelines from the central bank requiring banks \nto set their lending rates based on marginal cost of funds or the rates \noffered to new deposits, there will be greater transmission of reduced \npolicy rates to lending rates. The consequent reduction in the cost of \nborrowing is likely to boost aggregate demand. \n\nOn balance, growth is projected at 7.4% in FY2016, marginally lower \n\nthan the 7.6% achieved in FY2015 as the expected decline in external \ndemand offsets a pickup in domestic demand. Moreover, the weak \nbalance sheets of public sector banks will hamper lending and growth \nprospects. Growth is expected to pick up a bit to 7.8% in FY2017, helped \nby the government\u2019s strengthening of public sector banks\u2019 capital and \noperations, private investment bene\ufb01tting from corporate deleveraging, \nthe \ufb01nancing of stalled projects, and an uptick in bank credit. \n\nAfter 2 years of decline, consumer in\ufb02ation is likely to accelerate \nslightly in both years. The salary hike for civil servants would boost \nconsumption, perhaps fueling broad in\ufb02ation. Meanwhile, somewhat \nhigher global oil prices are likely in the second half of FY2016, some \nof which would transmit to retail prices. On the other hand, a normal \nmonsoon would help mitigate some of the pressure on food prices, \nwhich \ufb01rmed up in the second half of FY2015. Despite in\ufb02ation \ndeclining substantially in the past 3 years, in\ufb02ation expectations have \nremained elevated and even inched up since the beginning of FY2015, \nimplying that core in\ufb02ation is entrenched. In\ufb02ation is likely to average \n5.4% in FY2016, rising to 5.8% in FY2017 as global oil prices \ufb01rm up and \ndomestic demand strengthens. \n\nThe central bank has signaled an accommodative monetary stance, \n\nthough further cuts to key policy rates would be contingent on the \nevolving in\ufb02ation trajectory and the implementation of planned budget \nconsolidation. Thus, while aggressive rate cuts are unlikely, FY2016 may \nsee some monetary easing. \n\nThe FY2016 budget displays \ufb01scal prudence by reaffirming the path \n\nof \ufb01scal consolidation and reducing the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit to 3.5% of GDP. \nGross tax revenue growth of 11.7% in FY2016 seems achievable with \n\n \n \nRs trillion\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.13\u2002Purchasing managers\u2019 indexes \n\nManufacturing\nServices\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nNote: Nikkei, Markit.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 6 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002169\n\na tax buoyancy of 1.1.

The budget also \nincreases social sector spending and boosts infrastructure allocations \nfor road transport, power generation, renewable energy, and railways. \nThe expenditure mix is expected to deteriorate, however, with capital \nexpenditure projected to grow by only 3.9% (and decline as a share of \nGDP), against 11.8% expansion for current expenditure. Within current \nexpenditure, while petroleum subsidies are expected to decline further, \nallocations for food subsidies will increase. Outgo on account of salaries \nand pensions are budgeted to increase as the government implements \nrecommendations from the national commission. \n\nAs crude oil prices are projected to decline by 32% in FY2016, re\ufb01ned \n\npetroleum exports, which account for nearly 20% of merchandise exports, \nare likely to contract by 28% during FY2016. Sluggish global growth and \nan appreciating rupee in real effective terms are likely to further impede \nexports. Encouragingly, exports by volume of metal and metal products, \nbasmati rice, and drugs have been resilient, and higher prices for these \nkey exports are likely to provide a boost. On balance, exports will likely \ncontract by 1.5% in FY2016. Imports of crude oil are expected to decline \nby 24% on weak prices. Gold imports are likely to remain \ufb02at as volumes \nrise but prices decline. Other imports could inch up as domestic demand \nstrengthens, increasing total imports by 3.5%. Consequently, the current \naccount de\ufb01cit is expected to widen a bit to the equivalent of 1.6% of GDP \nin FY2016, up from an estimated 1.3% in FY2015.\n\nWith growth in the large advanced economies edging up, and \nhigher oil prices in 2017 helping exports of re\ufb01ned petroleum, overall \nmerchandise exports are expected to recover to 5.0% growth. At the \nsame time, imports are projected to rebound by 9.0% with higher growth \nand oil prices, causing the current account de\ufb01cit to widen to 1.8% of \nGDP. The higher current account de\ufb01cit will likely be easily \ufb01nanced by \nstable capital \ufb02ows. In the medium term, a sustained pickup in exports \nwould require a competitive currency, continued progress in reducing \nsupply-side bottlenecks, and a lower cost of doing business. \n\nNumerous measures enacted to attract foreign direct investment and \nfurther measures to improve the business environment will ensure that \nIndia remains a favored base for manufacturing and exporting. After \nregistering an out\ufb02ow of $4.4 billion in FY2015, portfolio investment \nis likely to pick up as Indian assets continue to look attractive vis-\u00e0-vis \nassets in emerging market peers. \n\n3.17.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n\u20027.4\n\n\u20025.4\n\n\u20131.6\n\n\u20027.8\n\n\u20025.8\n\n\u20131.8\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of \nthat\u00a0year.\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\f170\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014fostering bank \ufb01nance \nof\u00a0infrastructure\nThe private sector has played a large role in infrastructure \ufb01nancing \nsince 2005. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u20132017 envisioned 21% \nof infrastructure \ufb01nancing (and 42% of all debt \ufb01nancing) being \nsourced from banks. Infrastructure \ufb01nancing needs were estimated \nat around $200 billion per year to FY2017. Healthy banks are needed \nto ensure that the private sector can continue to play its desired role \nin infrastructure \ufb01nancing, as public infrastructure spending can be \nraised only so far, even in light of a substantial drop in government \ndebt. However, high and rising nonperforming assets (NPAs) in the \nbanking sector, coupled with an overleveraged corporate sector, could \nchoke off this important source of infrastructure \ufb01nancing, leaving a \nspeed bump on India\u2019s road to high and sustained economic growth. \nSince 2011, gross \ufb01xed capital formation has begun to decline as a \nshare of GDP and is no longer a signi\ufb01cant driver of economic growth \n(Figure\u00a03.17.14).\n\nThe nexus of a highly indebted corporate sector and proliferating \n\nNPAs will be difficult to resolve quickly. The interest cover ratio, \nmeasuring companies\u2019 ability to pay interest on their debts, remains \nlow in over 2,000 companies operating in such key sectors as \nelectric power, steel, and construction, as regularly surveyed by the \nReserve\u00a0Bank of India, the central bank\u2014though some sectors, such\u00a0as \nmanufacturing, experienced a decisive uptick in the last quarter of \nFY2014 (Figure 3.17.15). Credit growth has been slow, particularly at \npublic sector banks, which still hold about 72% of all bank assets and \nare a vital source of infrastructure \ufb01nancing for India\u2019s corporate \nsector. Key \ufb01nancial indicators deteriorated rapidly (Figure 3.17.16). \nWith banks understandably cautious about extending new loans while \nresolving their NPA issues and cleaning up their balance sheet, and \nwith the highly leveraged corporate sector reluctant to undertake new \ninvestment, viable projects may go un\ufb01nanced, considerably impeding \neconomic growth. \n\nThe causes for the sharp rise in NPAs are both internal and \n\nexternal: supply-side bottlenecks, a highly leveraged corporate sector, \nweak governance and project appraisal capacity within banks, and \na slowdown in global and domestic demand. Moreover, loans to the \nelectric power sector, to which banks are highly exposed, are beset \nwith problems related to the deteriorating health of power distribution \ncompanies. However, the government is taking a wide range of steps \nto address these issues, tackling bank governance, recapitalization, \ndebt restructuring, and NPA recognition. Its Indradhanush program, \nannounced in early 2015, aims to recapitalize public sector banks with \nRs700 billion over the next 4 years and strengthen internal governance. \n\nA package to strengthen the \ufb01nancial health of state-owned \nelectricity distributors was unveiled in November 2015, with states \nvoluntarily taking over 75% of the debt of their distribution companies. \nThe package provides incentives for electricity distributors to reduce \ntheir technical losses and debt service costs and to improve their \n\ufb01nancial discipline. \n\n3.17.14\u2002Investment indicators\n\nGross \ufb01xed \ncapital formation\n\n \n% of GDP \n40\n\nCredit to infrastructure\n\n \n\n% credit outstanding\n16\n\n2005\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2014\n\nSources: World Bank.

As most taxes are tied to tourism, growth was cut further \nas tax earnings net of subsidies fell. Growth came largely from robust \npublic investment that propelled a doubling of construction growth to \nover 40%. \n\nIn sharp contrast with previous years, tourism contracted by over \n\n4% as growth in arrivals slowed and bed-night occupancy slipped \n(Figure 3.18.2). Growth in tourist arrivals declined to 2% from 7% \nin\u00a02014 despite upbeat tourism globally and in Asia. Arrivals from \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\u2014which provides 30% of the \ntotal\u2014fell\u00a0by 1% following 6 years of rapid growth and despite resilient \noutbound travel from the PRC.

Despite some growth \nin arrivals, bed-night occupancy, which largely determines earnings, \nfell\u00a0by\u00a04.3% as the average stay continued to shorten.\n\nWith vibrant investment and construction, the related real estate \nsector expanded, and imports of wood, cement, and other construction \nmaterials jumped by about 40% over the year. Expansion in \ufb01shery-\nbased sectors, mainly agriculture and manufacturing, fell with lower \n\ufb01sh purchases by volume and output of processed \ufb01sh.

Budget expenditures including net lending surged \nby\u00a030%, their share of GDP rising in 2015 by 8.9 percentage points \nto 43.7% (Figure 3.18.4). Capital spending accounted for most of the \ngrowth, increasing by 5.2 percentage points while remaining below \n30% of total expenditures. Revenue grew by only 11%, much lower than \nbudgeted because increases in certain import duties were reversed and \nsurprisingly low tourist arrivals depressed tourism goods and services \ntaxes despite a rate hike from 8% to 12% in November 2014. The \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cit swelled to equal 7.4% of GDP, from 2.7% the previous year.\nMost of the \ufb01scal gap was \ufb01nanced domestically, through \nissuances of bonds and Treasury bills, and borrowing from other \n\ufb01nancial corporations. For the second time since issuances were \nconducted through a tap system in 2014, Treasury bill interest rates \nwere cut in November, by about 400 basis points across all maturities \n(Figure\u00a03.18.5). The value of Treasury bill issuances in November fell by \n35.1% and for the whole year by 17.2%, while growth in the outstanding \nvalue slowed markedly to 12.9% from 36.0% in 2014. As a percentage \nof GDP, domestic public debt stood at 47.4%, and external public debt \nat 20.5%, pushing total public debt to 67.9%, or 1.4 percentage points \nhigher than in 2014 (Figure 3.18.6).\n\nMonetary policy remained broadly expansionary, with policy \nrates of liquidity windows kept low (1.5% for the overnight deposits \nand 10.0% for the overnight Lombard) and the required reserve ratio \nhalved to 10% in August. Domestic assets expanded by 27.4% after \nfalling by 1.6% in 2014, with most of the growth in domestic credit \nderived from claims on the public sector, largely government securities \n(Figure\u00a03.18.7). Growth\u00a0in credit to the private sector quickened to 12.6% \nfrom 3.1% in 2014. Growth in money supply slowed slightly from 14.7% \nin\u00a02014 to 13.6% as net foreign assets fell by 2.6% following 5 years of \nrapid\u00a0growth.\n\nA larger trade de\ufb01cit and a decline in the services surplus from \nlower tourism receipts widened the current account de\ufb01cit substantially \nto 12.6% of GDP, the largest in 4 years (Figure 3.18.8). The trade de\ufb01cit \nwidened as exports, mainly \ufb01sh and re-exports of fuel, fell sharply by \n19.6% and imports, which are nearly 9 times exports, grew by 9.1% on \nhigher transport and construction-related imports, notwithstanding \nlow\u00a0global oil and commodity prices. \n\nIn\ufb02ows of direct and other investments were lower than in 2014, \n\nand the net capital and \ufb01nancial accounts fell short of covering the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit. Gross international reserves fell by $50.7 million \nto $564 million at year-end, although usable reserves\u2014funds available \nfor foreign exchange requirements\u2014increased slightly by $49.7 million \n(Figure 3.18.9), with import coverage at less than a month.\n\nEconomic prospects \nThe growth outlook rests heavily on prospects for tourism and \npublic-led investments.

Bed-night occupancy and \nearnings are projected to recover to positive but minimal growth, \nheld\u00a0back by the short average stay preferred by Asian tourists. \n\nThe PRC will continue to lead arrivals growth, but less so in view \n\nof recent trends, notably moderating economic growth there and \nstronger competition from nearer destinations. A stronger pickup from \nEurope may be expected as economic recovery there gathers pace. \nStrengthened\u00a0marketing, new \ufb02ights, and the opening of 10 new resorts \nare seen to boost travel interest. Integrated resorts for the middle-\nincome segment that are expected to open by 2017 would also help \naugment tourism numbers.\n\nGrowth will come largely from strong public investments fueling \n\nconstruction and real estate development. The government plans \nfor its public sector investment program to grow by about 140% to \nRf9.1 billion in 2016, with growth easing to 6% in 2017. Most of the \ninvestment surge is to be \ufb01nanced through external loans, while \ndomestic borrowing is to be kept restrained. Correspondingly, budget \nexpenditures are programmed to grow in 2016 by 23% and then \nmoderate in 2017. The\u00a0share of capital spending will rise to 39% in 2017 \nfrom 24% in 2015, while that of recurrent spending will decline to 61%. \nThe budget de\ufb01cit is expected to remain high at 6.5% of GDP in 2016 \nand 7.3% in 2017. \n\nAssuming similar investment growth in 2015, construction-led \n\nindustrial growth is projected to reach at least 20% in 2016 in \nconjunction with the public sector investment program before \nmoderating slightly in 2017. Against this backdrop and the expected \ngradual recovery in tourism, GDP growth is projected to rise to 3.5% \nin 2016 and further to 3.9% in 2017. Growth could be much higher if \ntourism or foreign investment picks up faster than expected, or if oil \nprices and therefore fuel and electricity subsidies decline more than \nanticipated. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is expected to remain low at 1.2% in 2016, as the further \neasing of world oil and food prices will help offset upside pressures from \nexpansionary policies. In\ufb02ation is seen edging up to 1.4% in 2017 as \nworld prices recover modestly. The current account de\ufb01cit is projected to \nremain large on strong construction-related imports and limited exports, \ndespite likely higher tourism receipts and low world commodity prices. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014diversifying the economy\nThe economy depends heavily on tourism. In the last 10 years, \ntourism has come to account directly for around 30% of GDP\u2014or \nnearly two-thirds if tourism-related sectors such as transportation \nand communications are included. This has increased the country\u2019s \nalready high vulnerability to external shocks and GDP growth volatility. \nTourism\u00a0has created signi\ufb01cant sources of government revenue, notably \nthe goods and services tax on tourism. At the same time, though, \nthe \ufb01scal balance has become much more led by the business cycle. \nStabilizing the economy and strengthening development depend on \ndiversifying the economic base.\n\n% of GDP\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n\u2212100\n\n3.18.6\u2002Public debt\n\nExternal\nDomestic \n\nRf billion\n\nTotal\n\n% of GDP\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2016. \nMonthly\u00a0Statistics.

Early this \nyear, the Maldives Monetary Authority began acquiring the capabilities \nnecessary to screen and register companies for participation. SEZs can, \nif well managed, enable economic diversi\ufb01cation into labor-intensive \nand strategic sectors, toward engendering economic stability and rapid \ngrowth. The country\u2019s existing liberal investment regime will help them \nsucceed with a range of incentives, including 100% foreign ownership, \nlong-term land leases, and freedom to employ foreign labor, among other \nrights. However, geographic and logistical conditions pose challenges to \ncommercial viability.\n\nThe government plans to expand \ufb01nancial services through \nIslamic\u00a0banking and a capital hub for channeling SEZ and tourism \ninvestments. The \ufb01nancial service sector is currently dominated \nby banks, which hold over 60% of \ufb01nancial assets (Figure 3.18.10). \nAlthough\u00a0bank assets as a share of GDP are high, expansion has been \nvolatile as most capital in\ufb02ows and lending are connected with tourism. \nSustained expansion has been restrained by sluggish credit to the \nprivate sector, a limited consumer market, high nonperforming loans, \nand the high cost of \ufb01nance. The development of SEZs provides good \npotential to widen the market base\u2014as can further development of a \nwider range of \ufb01nancial products and credit information and guarantee \nsystems to help reduce credit\u00a0risks.\n\nIslamic \ufb01nance was \ufb01rst introduced in 2005 through an insurance \n\ncompany that grew to become in 2011 a full-\ufb02edged bank offering \nvarious banking products and services in line with Islamic principles. \nFive licensed institutions currently offer Islamic \ufb01nance, and traditional \n\ufb01nance institutions have shown interest. The Maldives Monetary \nAuthority is developing a legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework \nto facilitate further expansion of Islamic banking. \n\nInstitutional capacity for macroeconomic and \ufb01scal management \n\nwill likely need strengthening to enhance the SEZ growth strategy, \nas\u00a0will expenditure management to ensure the sustainability of \nsubstantial external borrowing for infrastructure projects under \nexpansionary \ufb01scal programs for 2016 and 2017.

Growth  is  expected  to  slide  markedly  in  FY2016,  affected \nby  reconstruction  delays,  extended  trade  and  transit  disruptions  as  minority  groups  object  to \nfeatures  of  the  newly  announced  constitution,  and  an  unfavorable  monsoon.  Recovery  in  FY2017 \nis  contingent  on  accelerating  reconstruction  and  restoring  trade  and  transit  to  normal. \n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth fell to 3.0% in FY2015 (ended 15 July 2015) from 5.1% a \nyear earlier after earthquakes in April and May 2015 caused extensive \ndamage to homes and other infrastructure and caused transport and \nsupply disruptions (Figure 3.19.1). Growth in services, which account for \nover half of GDP, slowed to 3.9%, the lowest since 2012, as wholesale and \nretail trade, transport, tourism, and \ufb01nancial services were disrupted. \nExpansion in agriculture, which suffered earlier from an unfavorable \nmonsoon, slowed to 1.9%. Persistent supply-side constraints, especially \npower shortages, held back growth in industry to a lackluster 2.6%. \nIn\ufb02ation averaged 7.2% in FY2015, down from 9.1% a year earlier \n\nand the lowest since FY2008, as prices moderated across the board \n(Figure\u00a03.19.2). Despite a weak harvest and supply disrupted by the \nearthquakes in much of the country, food in\ufb02ation eased to average \n9.6%, which was still elevated but down from 11.6% in the previous \nyear as food stocks proved adequate and relief operations effective, \nand as in\ufb02ation fell in India, the country\u2019s major trading partner. \nNonfood\u00a0in\ufb02ation also moderated to average 5.2%, down from 6.8% in \nFY2014 as\u00a0the marked fall in global oil prices pulled down administered \ndomestic prices aligned with them. \n\nAlthough the FY2015 budget was announced in a timely manner, \nactual expenditure (equal to 20.0% of GDP) was just 81.0% of budget \nallocations, lower than the 84.0% achieved in the previous year. \nExpenditure was affected by disruptions from the earthquakes in the \nlast quarter of the \ufb01scal year, when expenditure bunching usually \ntakes place, but the expenditure shortfall mainly re\ufb02ected persistent \nprocedural and procurement inefficiencies that impede capital spending \nand economic development. Actual capital spending fell 30.0% short of \nthe budget allocation, a much larger shortfall than 21.6% a year earlier, \nand remained at only 4.0% of GDP (Figure 3.19.3).\n\nMonetary conditions continued to be highly accommodative, as in \nthe previous year. A surge in remittances bolstered bank deposits and \nreserves, but \ufb01nancial institutions struggled to \ufb01nd bankable projects \n\nThis chapter was written by Raju Tuladhar, Pradeep Singh, and Neelina Nakarmi of the \nNepal Resident Mission, ADB, Kathmandu.\n\n3.19.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points \n\n4.6\n\n3.8\n\n3.8\n\n5.1\n\n4.8\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 15 July of that year.\nSources: Central Bureau of Statistics. 2015.

The average interbank rate increased to 0.70% \nfrom 0.22% the previous year, indicating that short-term liquidity \nmanagement by Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank, had become \nmore effective (Figure 3.19.4). Weighted average deposit and lending \nrates continued to moderate, leaving real lending rates positive but real \ndeposit rates negative. Growth in credit to the private sector picked up \nto 19.4% from 18.3% a year earlier (Figure 3.19.5). Although the central \nbank continued to direct \ufb01nancial institutions to channel credit to \nproductive sectors to promote growth, private investment opportunities \nremained constrained by the persistent infrastructure de\ufb01cit, other \nsupply-side constraints, and political uncertainty.\n\nA slowdown in imports combined with the surge in remittance \nin\ufb02ows further expanded the current account surplus to 5.1% of GDP \nfrom 4.6% a year earlier (Figure 3.19.6). Despite the depreciation of the \nNepalese rupee, which is pegged to the Indian rupee, exports declined by \n3.9% as the currency appreciated in in\ufb02ation-adjusted terms and because \nearthquakes disrupted production and transport services. Import growth \nslowed markedly to 8.0% from 13.9% in the previous year, mainly as \nimports of petroleum products declined by 19.0% from the combined \neffects of falling global oil prices and supply disruptions in the \ufb01nal \nmonths of the year. The trade de\ufb01cit widened marginally to 31.2% of \nGDP from 30.7% in FY2014. Remittance in\ufb02ows grew by 12.2% to equal \na record 29.1% of GDP as migrant workers boosted their remittances \nto rebuild family homes and provide other post-earthquake support. \nThe\u00a0surplus in the overall balance of payments climbed to $1.5\u00a0billion, \nswelling gross foreign exchange reserves to $8.1 billion, enough to cover \nover 11 months of imports of goods and services (Figure 3.19.7).\n\nEconomic prospects \nEconomic growth is projected to slide further in FY2016 due to slow \nrecovery from the earthquakes, political strife on the Terai plains \nbordering India, and an unfavorable monsoon for the second year \nrunning. Earthquake recovery has been dismayingly slow largely \nbecause the establishment of the National Reconstruction Authority was \ngreatly delayed by political differences on its organizational structure \nand leadership. The high-powered authority\u2014considered necessary \nfor fast-tracking reconstruction through streamlined and prioritized \nprogram planning and implementation\u2014was officially established only \nin December 2015 under revised legislation. While its head has been \nnamed, the organization has yet to become fully functional. \n\nAlthough the Constituent Assembly, the second of which was elected \nin November 2013, \ufb01nally enacted the long-pending new constitution on \n20 September 2015, it did so amid protests from political parties on the \nTerai, which view as inadequate constitutional provisions for citizenship, \nprovincial and electoral constituency delineation, and the representation \nof disadvantaged groups in state organizations. The\u00a0protests escalated \ninto disruptive strikes beginning in September that shut down trade \nthrough cross-border entry points with India, causing acute shortages \nof petroleum products, raw materials for construction and industry, \nand other essential commodities.

Very low growth is seen in services, \nparticularly in wholesale and retail trade, transport and communication, \nand tourism, which are worst affected by the supply disruptions. \nThe\u00a0Ministry of Agricultural Development expects harvests of paddy \nto drop by 10.0% and maize by 5.0%, slowing agriculture growth to a \nprojected 0.5%. Industry is projected to see little or no growth owing \nto fuel shortages and the lack of raw materials for manufacturing and \nconstruction. GDP growth in FY2017 could rebound to 4.8%, but this \nassumes a normal monsoon, the National Reconstruction Authority \nbecoming fully operational and accelerating reconstruction, normal \ncross-border trade, and progress in resolving domestic political tensions. \nIn\ufb02ation is projected to rise to 10.5%, higher than the target of 8.5% set \n\nby the central bank in its FY2016 monetary policy. Although lower global \noil prices are being passed through to administered fuel prices (a\u00a0policy \nadopted in September 2014), average in\ufb02ation in FY2016 will be elevated \non the combined effects of a smaller harvest, acute shortages of fuel and \nother essential commodities, and higher transport costs during much of \nthe year. Food in\ufb02ation is expected to average 11.8% and nonfood in\ufb02ation \n9.5%. In\ufb02ation is projected to subside to 8.2% in FY2017. This\u00a0assumes a \nnormal harvest, fuel and other commodity supplies returning to normal, \nand lower global prices for oil and other commodities. \n\nNepal\u2019s external position is expected to further strengthen in FY2016 \n\nwith surpluses in both the current account and the overall balance of \npayments above the already high surpluses of FY2015. The trade de\ufb01cit \nis expected to narrow sharply on an 8.0% decline in imports resulting \nfrom the trade and transit disruption and lower prices for petroleum \nimports. The\u00a0narrowing will come despite a 15.0% fall in exports, \nwhich are much smaller than imports. The\u00a0signi\ufb01cant narrowing of the \ntrade de\ufb01cit coupled with a continued rise in remittances is expected \nto further expand the current account surplus to equal 10.3% of GDP. \nIn\u00a0FY2017, the current account surplus is expected to narrow again \nto 6.4% of GDP as import growth recovers on the resolution of trade \nobstruction and the increase in import demand with the acceleration \nof reconstruction programs, and with some\u00a0slowdown in remittance \nin\ufb02ows affected by weakening demand for labor in host countries.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nNepal\u2002\u2002179\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014accelerating reconstruction \nand capital expenditure \nThe devastating earthquakes challenged Nepal\u2019s growth and \ndevelopment prospects over the short to medium term. The disaster \nexacted a huge human toll, taking nearly 9,000 lives and destroying \n750,000 homes, factories, and cultural heritage sites. It upended the \nlivelihoods of 5.4 million, pushing an estimated 3.0% of the population \ninto poverty. The government\u2019s post-disaster needs assessment \nestimated $5.2 billion in capital stock losses and another $1.9 billion in \neconomic losses. The combined losses are estimated to equal one-third \nof GDP. The cost of recovery and rebuilding the lost capital stock is \nestimated at $6.7 billion (Table 3.19.1). \n\nNotwithstanding the signi\ufb01cant cost of reconstruction and recovery, \n\nthe key policy challenge is not a dearth of resources. Nepal\u2019s\u00a0development \npartners pledged $4.0 billion in reconstruction aid during the \nInternational Conference on Nepal\u2019s Reconstruction that the government \nsuccessfully organized in the aftermath of the earthquakes. Further, in \nresponse to the earthquakes, the government presented an ambitious \nbudget for FY2016, which calls for total spending to increase to equal \n32.1% of GDP from 24.3% in FY2015, while capital expenditure is to \nmore\u00a0than double to 10.0% of GDP (Figure 3.19.8). The $910 million \nallocation for reconstruction is nearly half of the capital budget. \nHowever, more than 8 months into the \ufb01scal year, only a \n\nsmall\u00a0fraction of the reconstruction budget has actually been spent, \nre\ufb02ecting institutional and procedural bottlenecks that constrain \nthe timely execution of capital works. Key factors holding back \nrapid reconstruction include (i) delay in establishing the National \nReconstruction Authority, which particularly affected the speedy \ninitiation of housing reconstruction; (ii) signi\ufb01cant damage in vast \nrural areas with difficult access; (iii) the limited capacity of sector \ninstitutions that oversee private housing, schools, hospitals, roads, and \nother community infrastructure to assess damage, plan reconstruction, \nprocure materials, and implement reconstruction with quality control; \nand (iv) the limited availability of such human resources as masons, \nengineers, and social workers. \n\nThere has nevertheless been progress in pre-construction activities, \nas the National Reconstruction Authority was \ufb01nally established and its \nhead appointed in December 2015 toward beginning signi\ufb01cant physical \nreconstruction by April 2016. To make up for the delay, signi\ufb01cant \nefforts are required toward (i) fully operationalizing the authority \nwith a lean structure and autonomy to effectively monitor, coordinate, \nand enforce timely delivery by designated agencies; (ii)\u00a0ensuring the \nquality of design and implementation toward building back better; \n(iii)\u00a0building\u00a0and supplementing capacity in relevant institutions \nthrough outsourcing and management support; (iv) assembling and \ntraining a sufficient number of skilled and semiskilled workers for \nreconstruction; and (v)\u00a0ensuring transparency and accountability in \nprogram delivery with community participation. \n\n3.19.6\u2002Current account indicators\n\nExports\nOil imports\nNon-oil imports\nTourism and travel\nWorkers\u2019 remittances\nCurrent account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\n$ billion\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 15 July of that year.\nSource: Nepal Rastra Bank. 2016.

Capital spending has \nbeen persistently weak at the equivalent of about 4.0% of GDP annually, \nbut spending at 8.2%\u201311.8% of GDP is required to close existing \ninfrastructure gaps within a decade. Nepal\u2019s robust \ufb01scal balance in \nrecent years suggests that there are substantial \ufb01scal resources with \nwhich to expand capital expenditures. Current circumstances call for \nwider and longer-term reform and capacity development in investment \nplanning, budget formulation and execution, and project management \nincluding design, procurement, and implementation that is timely and \ncost-effective and has good quality control. \n\nLikewise, investment in human capital development needs to be \nenhanced in terms of both amount and quality. Despite substantial \nachievement of Millennium Development Goals related to education, \nNepal\u2019s human capital base remains very weak, with only 14% of \n16-year-olds earning school completion certi\ufb01cates. The country \ncannot afford to be complacent but needs to substantially improve its \ndelivery of education services in primary schools, technical education \nand vocational training centers, and universities. This calls for \naccelerating reform to improve the quality of education and learning \noutcomes through the early enactment of the proposed education act, \nrestructuring of school and examination systems, improvement of \nteacher management and development, and establishment of strong and \nregular mechanisms to guide the reform process. \n\nThese efforts to build critical infrastructure and human capital need \n\nto be accompanied by economic and sector reform as announced in the \nFY2016 budget. Reform can engender an enabling environment to attract \nprivate sector investments into the country\u2019s competitive industries \nsuch as high-value agriculture and agro-processing, hydropower, labor-\nintensive and other competitive manufacturing, and high-value services \nsuch as tourism and information and communication technology. \nPriorities include legislative reform to promote public\u2013private \npartnership, efficient budgetary processes and management, industrial \nenterprise development, agribusiness promotion, and institutional and \nregulatory restructuring of the energy sector.\n\n\fPakistan\n\nThe  economy  continued  to  pick  up  in  FY2015  as  economic  reform  progressed  and  security \nimproved.  Inflation  markedly  declined,  and  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed  with  favorable \nprices  for  oil  and  other  commodities.  Despite  global  headwinds,  the  outlook  is  for  continued \nmoderate  growth  as  structural  and  macroeconomic  reform  deepens.  Persistence  will  be  required \nto  overcome  longstanding  structural  impediments  to  investment  and  enable  faster  growth.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth edged up slightly to 4.2% in FY2015 (ended 30 June 2015) \nbut remained below the government target of 5.0% (Figure 3.20.1). \nServices expanded by 5.0% and remained the largest contributor to \ngrowth in FY2015, as agriculture and manufacturing posted more \nmodest gains. Growth in services was led by recovery in \ufb01nance and \ninsurance that re\ufb02ected higher pro\ufb01ts and in general government \nservices, which expanded on higher infrastructure spending and \nwages. Continued energy shortages, slowing external demand, and \na\u00a0base effect on food and fertilizers pushed down expansion in large-\nscale manufacturing to 3.3%. Continued resilience in small-scale \nmanufacturing and a pickup in construction to double digits supported \nindustry growth at 3.6% that was nevertheless nearly a full percentage \npoint lower than a year earlier.\n\nConsumption grew by 5.1% in FY2015 and remained the largest \ndemand-side component in GDP. Private consumption expanded by \n3.6%, bene\ufb01tting from continued in\ufb02ows of remittances, higher public \nsector salaries, and low in\ufb02ation, while public consumption rebounded \nto grow by 16% (Figure 3.20.2). Total investment increased to equal \n15.1% of GDP in FY2015, largely on higher public \ufb01xed investment. \nPrivate \ufb01xed investment edged lower to 9.7% of GDP from 10.0% a year \nearlier, hampered by continued energy constraints and the generally \nweak business environment that has depressed investment for several \nyears. Net exports subtracted from growth for a second consecutive year \nas exports fell more sharply than imports. \n\nAverage consumer price in\ufb02ation decelerated by almost half to 4.5% \n\nin FY2015 in line with lower global prices for oil and food.

The central bank cut policy rates by a cumulative \n300 basis points in four steps from November 2014 to May 2015 to \nlower its lending rate to banks (the reverse repurchase rate) to\u00a07.0%. \nTo\u00a0improve transmission of monetary policy, the central bank \nintroduced from 1 June 2015 the policy rate, a new target for operations \nin the money market that will be maintained 50 basis points below \nthe reverse repurchase rate, as it narrowed the interest rate corridor \nto 200\u00a0basis points. Subsequently, to support domestic credit growth, \nit\u00a0lowered in September all corridor rates by 50 basis points to bring the \nnew policy rate to 6.0% (Figure 3.20.4). \n\nThe consolidated budget de\ufb01cit excluding grants equaled 5.4% \n\nof GDP in FY2015, marginally lower than in the previous year \n(Figure\u00a03.20.5). Nevertheless, recent performance is markedly better \nthan the average de\ufb01cit of 8.1% of GDP during FY2011\u2013FY2013, \nas\u00a0notable progress was achieved in reining in energy subsidies and \nboosting tax revenues by eliminating many concessions and exemptions. \nOn the expenditure side, increases in power tariffs reduced total \nbudget subsidies to 1.0% of GDP. Another achievement was to increase \nfunding for the public sector development program to 3.7% of GDP \nfrom an average 3.4% during FY2012\u2013FY2014. That the primary \nde\ufb01cit (the\u00a0overall de\ufb01cit less interest payments) meanwhile fell more \nsteeply than the overall de\ufb01cit\u2014to 0.7% of GDP from 4.1% in FY2013\u2014\nunderlines how rapidly interest payments on the public debt are \nexpanding. \n\nGovernment revenue was, at 14.4% of GDP in FY2015, marginally \nlower than in the previous year as larger tax collection was offset by the \nnormalization of nontax revenue receipts, which had ballooned in the \npreceding year with one-off events. Tax collection by the Federal\u00a0Board \nof Revenue enjoyed double-digit growth that still fell short of the \nambitious budget target. Slower growth in both direct taxes and general \nsales tax re\ufb02ected weakness in manufacturing, declining imports, and \nlower in\ufb02ation crimping the tax base. Tax as a share of GDP is, at 11%, \nvery low compared with other Asian economies. Ongoing reform aims to \nwiden the tax net, improve tax administration, and eliminate distortions \nin the tax system.\n\nThe budget de\ufb01cit was \ufb01nanced mostly by heavy borrowing from \n\ncommercial banks (Figure 3.20.6). Nearly 80% of the expansion \nin banking system credit during FY2015 went to the government. \nDespite\u00a0ample liquidity provided by the central bank, growth in \nprivate\u00a0credit slowed to PRs209 billion from PRs371 billion a year \nearlier. Credit demand for working capital including trade \ufb01nance \nslowed as commodity prices declined, power shortages continued, and \nexternal demand remained weak. Loans for \ufb01xed investment increased \nmarkedly, albeit from a small base. \n\nTotal public debt marginally declined to the equivalent of 64.8% of \nGDP in FY2015 from 65.1% the previous year, but it remained above the \n60% threshold set under the Fiscal Responsibility Debt Limitation\u00a0Act, \n2005 (Figure 3.20.7).

Better public debt \nmanagement has reduced the share of short-term domestic debt by 14% \nsince 2013, lengthening the maturity pro\ufb01le. However, half of domestic \ndebt is still short term and vulnerable to interest rate variation.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit eased to the equivalent of 1.0% of GDP \n\nin FY2015 from 1.3% a year earlier (Figure 3.20.8). The trade de\ufb01cit \nwidened by 3.8% to $17.2 billion as exports fell by 4.0%, mainly from a \nmarked drop in textile and cotton exports, while the large decline in \noil import payments was largely offset by increased quantities of other \nimports\u2014including consumer goods, textile raw materials, iron and \nsteel, and selected food items\u2014such that total imports fell by only 0.9%. \nDe\ufb01cits in both services and primary income also widened, but an 18.2% \ngain in worker remittances to $18.7 billion nevertheless brought modest \nimprovement in the current account de\ufb01cit. \n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is expected to accelerate modestly to 4.5% in FY2016 and \n4.8% in FY2017, assuming continued macroeconomic stability, expected \nimprovement in energy supply, and planned infrastructure investment \ntied to an economic corridor project linking Pakistan with the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). Further implementation of structural reform \nwill consolidate recent gains in macroeconomic stability and improve \nthe investment climate as the security situation improves, especially in \nKarachi, the commercial hub of the country. \n\nGrowth in industry is expected to be driven by strong expansion \nin construction and continued moderate expansion in mining, utilities, \nand manufacturing. Growth in large-scale manufacturing accelerated \nto 3.9% in the \ufb01rst half of FY2016 from 2.7% in the same period of \nlast year, supported by low prices for raw materials, improved gas and \nelectricity supply, and expanded construction, as well as lower interest \nrates (Figure 3.20.9). However, textile production, the largest segment, \ngrew by only 1.0% during the \ufb01rst half and is expected to constrain \noverall growth in large-scale manufacturing this year, partly because \nof weaker demand in export markets and rising competition. Strong \nconstruction that re\ufb02ects government spending on development and \nlarge investments in power projects has pushed up cement production.\nAgriculture is likely to continue to grow only moderately, as cotton \n\noutput is projected to fall because of heavy rains in July 2015 and \nmuch lower global cotton prices. However, continued strong expansion \nin livestock, which accounts for over half of agricultural production, \nwill partly offset reductions elsewhere. The government introduced \nan agriculture support package in September 2015 that offers cash \ntransfers to cotton growers, tax concessions for imports of agricultural \nmachinery, and subsidies for fertilizers. Growth in services will be \nled largely by transport improvements and higher pro\ufb01ts for \ufb01nancial \nservices, though retail and wholesale trade should also bene\ufb01t from \nimproved industrial activity.\n\nConsumption will expand with low in\ufb02ation, higher public sector \n\nsalaries and pensions, and government employment schemes in the \nauto industry, but a slowdown in remittances and lower commodity \n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201330\n\n3.20.6\u2002Budget borrowing from banks\n\nScheduled banks\nState Bank of Pakistan\nTotal budgetary support\n\nPRs trillion\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\nJul\u2212Dec\n2015\n\nJul\u2212Dec\n2016\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan.

Military operations in parts of \nthe country have signi\ufb01cantly curtailed the terror attacks that had \nhampered economic activity in recent years. Net private credit \ufb02ows \nmore than doubled during the \ufb01rst 7 months of FY2016, mainly for \n\ufb01xed investment and working capital in manufacturing, electricity, \nand construction. Net exports will continue to be a drag on growth as \nexports falter and lower oil imports are offset by higher quantities of \nother imports. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is expected to average 3.2% in FY2016, re\ufb02ecting lower \nglobal oil and commodity prices. In the \ufb01rst 8 months of the \ufb01scal\u00a0year, \nin\ufb02ation averaged only 2.5%, with food in\ufb02ation at 1.5% and other \nin\ufb02ation at 3.2%. Tax adjustments on some imports in December 2015 \nare expected, however, to push in\ufb02ation up marginally in the remaining \nmonths of the \ufb01scal year. In\ufb02ation is expected to pick up to 4.5% in \nFY2017, mainly because of a slight recovery expected in global oil prices, \n\ufb01rmer prices for other international commodities, and somewhat higher \ndomestic demand. \n\nThe central bank stood by its accommodative monetary stance \nas in\ufb02ation fell. In September, it reduced the policy rate, effective in \nOctober, by 50 basis points to 6%, the lowest in decades. Net credit to \nthe private sector expanded by PRs310 billion during the \ufb01rst 7 months \nof FY2015 from PRs164 billion in the same period of the previous year, \nre\ufb02ecting monetary easing and capacity improvements. The government \nborrowed heavily from commercial banks to \ufb01nance the de\ufb01cit and to \nretire its debt to the central bank. \n\nThe FY2016 budget targets a lower \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit equal to 4.3% \n\nof GDP, to be achieved by both boosting revenue and containing \nexpenditure. Revenues are budgeted to increase by 17.6% and \nexpenditure by 7.0%. Federal Board of Revenue tax collection during \nthe \ufb01rst half of FY2016 fell below target partly because lower oil prices \nundercut import duty collection (Figure 3.20.10). To offset the revenue \nshortfall, the excise duty on cigarettes was increased, and regulatory \nduties and additional customs duties were imposed on a variety of \nproducts, especially luxury goods, effective on 1 December 2015. \nThe\u00a0government further curtailed tax concessions and exemptions in \nFebruary 2016. \n\nOn the spending side, the government is selectively trimming \n\ncurrent and capital spending, which includes absorbing the cost of \nthe agricultural support package announced in September. Budgetary \nallocations for the public sector development program in FY2016 were \nincreased by 50% over the amount actually spent in the previous year. \nThe higher allocations include extending the Benazir Income Support \nProgram to 5.3 million bene\ufb01ciaries and the rollout of a conditional \ncash-transfer program for education that will bene\ufb01t 1 million children \nby the end of the \ufb01scal year. Moreover, 11% of spending is earmarked \nfor transport projects under the economic corridor project with the \nPRC. Budgetary spending on untargeted subsidies, including for \nelectric power, was reduced by a third over the past 3 years as the \ngovernment raised power tariffs to bring them close to cost recovery. \n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3.20.9\u2002Large-scale manufacturing\n\n% change, year on year\n\n4.1\n\n4.3\n\n3.9\n\n3.3\n\n2.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.2\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015\n\nJul\u2212Dec\n2015\n\nJul\u2212Dec\n2016\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan.

However, \nlow global prices for oil, which fuels a third of power generation in the \ncountry, have temporarily lifted some of the \ufb01nancial pressure on these \nhigh-cost producers. Construction on larger and more efficient plants is \nrapidly proceeding.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit in FY2016 is projected to remain low \nat 1.0% of GDP for a second year in a row as prices for oil and other \ncommodities stay low and in\ufb02ows continue under the Coalition Support \nFund\u2014despite declining exports and slowing growth in remittances. \nThe current account de\ufb01cit fell to 1.2% of GDP during the \ufb01rst 7 \nmonths of FY2016 from 1.7% a year earlier as trade and services de\ufb01cits \nnarrowed. Import payments fell by 7.0% on divergent developments: \nfood and petroleum products, which together account for about \none-third of imports, fell by 32% because of high domestic wheat stocks \nand the drop in global oil prices. Meanwhile, all other imports grew \nby 8.3% on quantity increases for textile raw materials (re\ufb02ecting \nthe drop in domestic cotton production), fertilizers, and power \ngeneration machinery (re\ufb02ecting major investment in the power sector). \nThe\u00a0savings from lower import payments were more than offset by an \n11.4% fall in export receipts over the period, re\ufb02ecting lower quantities \nand prices. \n\nChallenges for export growth are generally weak external demand, \n\ngrowth moderation in the PRC, Pakistan rupee appreciation against \nthe euro, lost textile market share to new competitors, and unfavorable \nterms of trade for exports with little value added. Persistent rupee \nappreciation, by 20% in real terms over the past 2 years, has adversely \naffected export competitiveness (Figure 3.20.11). The rupee continued \nto be a relatively strong currency as the US dollar strengthened in \nthe \ufb01rst half of FY2016, depreciating by only 2.8% to PRs104.9 per \ndollar. Assuming some revival in prices for oil and other commodities, \nlarger imports to support higher investment and growth, and some \nimprovement in exports as factories enjoy better power supply, the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit is projected to widen to 1.2% of GDP in FY2017. \nWorkers remittances expanded by only 6% in the \ufb01rst 7 months of \n\nFY2016, down from an average of 15% annually in the previous 6\u00a0years, \nthe falloff likely re\ufb02ecting reduced oil incomes in the Gulf, a major host \nregion. As remittances signi\ufb01cantly contribute receipts and buffer against \nexternal shocks, any sustained slowdown on top of falling exports would \ncreate concern for the stability of external accounts. \n\nOfficial foreign exchange reserves expanded to $15.4 billion in \nJanuary 2016 (Figure 3.20.12). The \ufb01nancial account was strengthened \nby a $500 million euro bond issued in September 2015 and larger \nmultilateral disbursements in the \ufb01rst 7 months of FY2016. However, \nin\ufb02ows that do not create debt continued to be limited, as foreign \ndirect investment increased only slightly to $624 million, with in\ufb02ows \nmainly into electric power and oil and gas, while portfolio investment \namounted to only $155 million. \n\n3.20.11\u2002 Exchange rates\n\nNominal effective\nReal effective \n\nIndex, 2010 = 100\n\n130\n\n110\n\n90\n\n70\n\nNominal\n \n\nPRs/$\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.20.12\u2002Gross international reserves\n\n$ billion\n\n \n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan.

Growth has been volatile, with periodic episodes of high \ngrowth followed by spells of low growth as economic reform is \nimplemented only sporadically and incompletely (Figure 3.20.13). \nGDP growth fell to an average of 2.8% during FY2009\u2013FY2013 from \n6.6% during FY2004\u2013FY2008. Longer-term growth potential has also \ndeclined. Studies that have disaggregated growth into supply-side \ncomponents suggest that the contributions of productivity gains and \ncapital accumulation have slipped.\n\nChallenges that impede growth in Pakistan include weak \n\ninfrastructure and transport connectivity and inadequate workforce \nskills, governance and institutions, service delivery, and access to \ufb01nance. \nLimited public resources constrain investment in infrastructure \n\nfor energy, transport, irrigation, and urban services. This impairs \nconnectivity, raises the cost of doing business, restrains productivity, \nand blocks access to public services. Governance and institutional \nchallenges across all sectors undermine effective public service \ndelivery and obstruct private sector development. Operational losses \nincurred by many large public enterprises drain already meager public \nresources. These challenges are most obvious in the energy sector and \nits de\ufb01cient infrastructure. Inadequate investment has weakened human \ndevelopment, and the resulting dearth of skills hampers the country\u2019s \nability to compete in global markets and transition to production with \nhigher value added. Access to \ufb01nance is limited as the \ufb01nancial system \nlacks depth because of constrains on both demand and supply. \n\nThese barriers are re\ufb02ected in Pakistan\u2019s low ranking in the \nWorld\u00a0Bank\u2019s Doing Business Report 2016, at 138 out of 189 economies \nsurveyed. Policies to alleviate these constraints would help improve \nthe business climate, raise domestic savings and investment, boost \ncompetitiveness and exports, and improve public service delivery, \nthereby boosting productivity and growth. \n\nThe government is currently implementing a structural reform \nprogram to relieve constraints on growth by improving service delivery \nin energy and other infrastructure sectors, expanding \ufb01scal space, \nfostering a competitive business environment, liberalizing trade, and \nrestructuring or privatizing public enterprises. \n\nEconomic reform and an improving security environment should \n\nfurther boost business con\ufb01dence and foster private investment. \nOngoing reforms to address the power de\ufb01cit, which is the greatest \nimpediment to manufacturing and growth, have shown progress. \nImproved governance in the energy sector has reduced power outages \nfor industry, improved tariff revenue recovery, and curtailed line losses. \nInitiatives to monitor the performance of power distribution companies \nand to introduce multiyear tariffs aim to improve efficiency and \nstrengthen the regulatory environment. \n\nWith power tariffs gradually moving toward market-based \n\npricing, power sector subsidies are contained, thus leaving funds for \ninfrastructure spending. Reform is under way to raise tax revenues and \nwiden the tax base through improved governance of tax administration \nsupported by legislative action. The government has also initiated a \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nPakistan\u2002\u2002187\n\nprocess for restructuring and possibly privatizing prioritized public \nenterprises under a dedicated reform strategy. Besides providing \n\ufb01scal relief and improving service delivery, efficiency improvements \nthanks to these reforms are critical to improving the competitiveness \nof downstream industries that depend on production from these \nenterprises for inputs. \n\nThe government\u2019s plan to improve the business climate addresses \nissues across the board: obtaining construction permits, paying taxes, \nenforcing contracts, starting businesses, trading across borders, and \naccessing credit. As the \ufb01rst step, the government introduced one-stop \nshops online to facilitate new business registration, streamline \ufb01rms\u2019 \nnavigation of business regulations and bureaucratic procedures, and \nreduce the cost of doing business. It started to remove statutory tax \nconcessions and exemptions, reduce maximum import tariff rates, \nand institute a simpler tariff system with fewer slabs. The National \nFinancial Inclusion Strategy was launched in May 2015 to broaden \naccess to \ufb01nance. The enactment of the Credit Bureau Bill aims to \nsupport \ufb01nancial institutions\u2019 extension of credit to more small and \nmedium-sized enterprises. The Deposit Protection Fund is being set \nup to establish a modern deposit insurance mechanism to strengthen \n\ufb01nancial stability. \n\nA sustained reform effort will be required over the medium to \nlong term to boost productivity and potential growth, building on the \nprogress achieved so far. Reform needs to be supplemented by other \npolicy measures, including the formulation of a well-coordinated \nindustrial policy to support faster growth and revive exports. While \nthe government is committed to its reform program, implementation \nchallenges that include resistance from various stakeholders could \nslow progress. In addition, domestic security concerns remain despite \nimprovement, and natural disasters are a perennial downside risk. \nThe\u00a0price of oil remains a wildcard.\n\n\fSri Lanka\n\nGrowth  was  marginally  lower  in  2015,  but  the  current  account  deficit  improved  slightly  and \ninflation  moderated.  Meanwhile,  the  budget  deficit  widened,  and  foreign  exchange  reserves \ndropped  sharply.  The  government  will  have  to  work  to  realign  fiscal  policy  toward  putting  the \ncountry  on  a  high  and  sustainable  growth  track.\n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic expansion has markedly slowed in the past 3 years from the \nrapid pace of the post-con\ufb02ict economic boom. Provisional estimates \nplace growth at 4.8% in 2015, marginally lower than 4.9% expansion a \nyear earlier (Figure 3.21.1). Weak global demand and political change \ncharacterized the year, as did an expansive \ufb01scal policy following \npresidential elections in January and parliamentary contests in August \nthat established a coalition cabinet. Investment faltered as investors \ndecided to wait and see, and as the new administration cut capital \nspending and temporarily suspended some large investment projects \napproved by its predecessor. A surge in private and government \nconsumption spending was left to sustain growth during the year.\n\nOn the supply side, 5.3% expansion in the large service sector was \nthe main driver of growth as the contribution from industry declined. \nThe higher outcome for services came from acceleration in \ufb01nancial \nactivities and in transportation of goods and passengers. Agriculture \nexpanded by 5.5%, up from 4.9% a year earlier as the paddy harvest \nrecovered and the production of fruit and vegetables increased\u2014\nand despite lower output of tea and rubber, two major export crops. \nExpansion in industry slowed to 3.0% from 3.5% a year earlier, dragging \ndown growth. Apparel production stagnated on weak external demand, \nthough the important food-processing industry expanded by 5.4% \neven as exports slumped. Weakness in industry mainly re\ufb02ected a \n0.9% decline in construction caused by a marked fall in public and \nprivate\u00a0investment. \n\nPreliminary demand-side estimates of real GDP are not available, \n\nbut nominal expenditure was estimated by the Central Bank of \nSri\u00a0Lanka. Central bank projections of private and government \nconsumption expenditure indicate much higher growth in 2015 than \nin 2014, while investment, exports, and imports fell (Figure 3.21.2). \nGovernment\u00a0consumption accelerated to 25.3% growth from 15.9% \nin 2014, re\ufb02ecting higher pay and allowances for public employees. \nExpansion in private spending picked up to 8.0% from 4.7% in 2014 on \nhigher salaries and larger transfers.

While food \nin\ufb02ation was almost 20% in January and February 2015, it subsequently \nstabilized to bring average annual food in\ufb02ation to 5.4%. At the same \ntime, nonfood in\ufb02ation hovered at around 2% in the \ufb01rst half of 2015. \nIt trended up in the second half partly because of Sri Lankan rupee \ndepreciation from September but averaged only 2.6% for the year. \nOverall in\ufb02ation was 4.2% year on year in December 2015, but in \nJanuary 2016 prices were 0.7% below those a year earlier because of a \nsharp fall in food prices from December highs and a large base effect \n(Figure 3.21.3). \n\nCredit to the private sector accelerated sharply from mid-2014 to \nreach 25.1% in December 2015 (Figure 3.21.4). Much of the growth was \nfrom expansion in consumer credit fueled by excess liquidity in the \ndomestic money market. In view of growing pressure on the balance of \npayments and foreign exchange reserves, the central bank tightened its \nmonetary policy and in mid-January 2016 raised the statutory reserve \nratio by 1.5 percentage points to 7.5% (Figure 3.21.5). As a result, excess \nliquidity declined to SLRs42 billion from SLRs90 billion in December \n2015, causing a slight upward adjustment in market interest rates. \nIn\u00a0February 2016, the central bank \ufb01rmed its policy rates by 50 basis \npoints. Growth in credit to the private sector has slowed slightly. \n\nThe all share price index remained high at around 7,000 for most \nof 2015 (despite some overseas investors\u2019 withdrawal of capital) on the \nexpectation that the new government would set an economic policy \noriented to the private sector (Figure 3.21.6). However, deepening \neconomic uncertainty and the government\u2019s announcement to suspend \ntax reforms announced in the 2016 budget caused the market to slump \nand likely put off new portfolio and foreign direct investment. \n\ngovernment\u2019s revised budget for 2015 aimed to provide more support for \nthe poor and to collect more revenue from high-income groups and large \ncommercial operations. The budget provided for a sizeable monthly \nallowance for public employees and higher transfers and subsidies. \nThese changes combined with higher interest payments (which consume \nabout one-third of budget revenue) to boost recurrent expenditure to \n14.7% of GDP from 12.9% the previous year (Figure 3.21.7). Reversing \nrecent trends, revenue increased to 12.2% of GDP from 11.6% in 2014 \non increases in excise and custom duties on vehicle imports as imports \nsurged in response to lower import tax rates set in the revised budget. \nThe overall budget de\ufb01cit excluding grants widened to the equivalent of \n7.2% of GDP in 2015, well above both the 5.7% outcome in the previous \nyear and the 4.9% budget target. Total government debt is estimated to \nhave increased to equal 73.5% of GDP in 2015 (Figure 3.21.8). \n\nBudget policy for 2016 sought to enhance tax revenue. The 2016 \n\nbudget, presented to Parliament in November 2015, set a lower \nminimum threshold for liability under the value-added tax (VAT) to \nSLRs12\u00a0million from SLRs15 million, and revised the prevailing 11% \nsingle rate into three bands: 0%, 8%, and 12.5%. The threshold for the \n\n3.21.1\u2002 National versus Colombo \nconsumer price index\n\nThe national consumer price index \nwas released in November\u00a02015 with \nthe series starting in January\u00a02014. \nCompared with the Colombo \nconsumer price index, it\u00a0has \nbroader coverage, including all the \nprovinces and a larger basket that \nadds two new categories: alcoholic \nbeverages and tobacco, and hotels \nand restaurants. The national index \nputs more weight on food, at\u00a044% \nversus 41% on the Colombo index. \nWhile in\ufb02ation measured by the \nnational index in 2015 was on \naverage 3.8%, it\u00a0was much lower at \n0.9% as measured by the Colombo \nindex. This was because housing \nrent showed a decline in Colombo \nafter a signi\ufb01cant rise in 2013 and \nearly\u00a02014, which substantially \npushed down in\ufb02ation as measured \nby the Colombo index.\n\nFood\nNonfood\nOverall\n \n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nJan\n2015\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka. \nhttp://statistics.gov.lk (accessed on 24 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nEfforts for \ufb01scal consolidation were reversed in 2015.

The budget also aimed \nto stop ad\u00a0hoc and unproductive tax concessions offered by various \ngovernment agencies. Moreover, tax concessions granted for any \ninvestment project were brought under the supervision and monitoring \nof the Ministry\u00a0of\u00a0Finance.\n\nThe implementation of major tax reform to the VAT and national \nbuilding tax were deferred in January 2016. The latest \ufb01scal projection \ntaking into account these developments estimates a more modest \nincrease in revenue equal to 13.2% of GDP, rather than 16.3% as \nproposed in the original budget, while the original ambitious public \ninvestment target is reduced. In this \ufb01scal framework, recurrent \nexpenditure is to be contained at 14.1% of GDP, while public investment \nwill be 5.2%. The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit excluding grants will narrow to 5.9% of \nGDP in 2016. \n\nThe balance of payments was under pressure in 2015 from a decline \n\nin exports, weak remittances from workers overseas, and large capital \nout\ufb02ows. The current account de\ufb01cit narrowed, however, on account \nof much lower spending on oil imports and robust tourist arrivals. \nExport earnings dropped by 5.6% in line with lower earnings from \nall major export categories as global demand weakened and prices \nfell. Exports of tea, rubber products, and garments largely accounted \nfor the decline. Imports also fell during the year, by 2.5%, re\ufb02ecting \ndiverse developments. Imports other than oil\u2014notably vehicles but \nother\u00a0consumer goods as well\u2014increased sharply by 10%, while oil \nimports fell by 41% because of lower prices to a total $1.9 billion less \nthan a\u00a0year\u00a0earlier.\n\nEarnings from tourism continued to expand robustly, growing by \n17.8% to $2.9 billion. Overseas workers\u2019 remittances contracted by 0.5% \nto $6.9 billion, which seemed to be partly attributable to the fall in oil \nprices and weak growth in the Middle East, the main host destination. \nOn balance, the current account recorded an estimated de\ufb01cit equal \nto 1.9% of GDP in 2015, narrower than the 2.6% de\ufb01cit in 2014 \n(Figure\u00a03.21.9).\n\nCapital out\ufb02ow was the major factor in the deterioration of the \n\nbalance of payments in 2015. Foreign investments in government \nsecurities recorded a net out\ufb02ow of $1.1 billion, while foreign direct \ninvestment and portfolio in\ufb02ows were well below levels a year earlier. \nThe central bank estimates the overall balance of payments de\ufb01cit to be \n$1.5 billion, reversing a surplus of $1.7 billion in 2014. \n\nGross international reserves fell to $7.3 billion in December 2015 \nfrom $8.2 billion a year earlier and declined further to $6.3 billion in \nJanuary 2016 (Figure 3.21.10). Sri Lanka\u2019s latest sovereign bond, for \n$1.5\u00a0billion, was issued on 28 October 2015 at a coupon rate of 6.850% \nper annum. Fitch Ratings rated it BB\u2013, Moody\u2019s Investors Service \nB1, and Standard and Poor\u2019s B+. Gross international reserves were \nsupported by a $1.1 billion currency swap arrangement with India \nconcluded in September 2015. \n\nThe Sri Lanka rupee was broadly stable against the US dollar \n\nfor most of 2015 but weakened after September 2015, when the \ncentral bank stopped intervening on the foreign exchange market. \n\n3.21.4\u2002 Interest rate, credit, and \n\nmoney\u00a0growth\n\nWeighted average prime lending rate\nMoney supply (M2b)\n \nPrivate sector credit\n\n%\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n\u201340\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

In all of \n2015, the rupee depreciated by 9% against the dollar and by nearly 4% \nin nominal and real effective terms, following a 3-year trend of gradual \nappreciation.\n\nExternal debt in June 2015 was $43.5 billion, equal to 58.1% of GDP, \n\nof which 83% had a maturity of more than 1 year and was categorized \nas long term. The government\u2019s outstanding external debt amounted to \n$24.3 billion, or 56% of all external debt, of which $8.4 billion was in \ndebt securities (Treasury bills and international sovereign bonds) and \n$6.8\u00a0billion was from multilateral lenders, $6.1 billion from bilateral \nlenders, and $3.0 billion from commercial sources. \n\nEconomic prospects\nWeak global demand and uncertainty over policy will continue to hold \ndown economic performance in 2016. Weak demand and low prices \nfor Sri Lanka\u2019s major exports will constrain economic growth and \nexert pressure on the balance of payments, though somewhat lower \noil prices projected for 2016 will alleviate this pressure, albeit less \nthan in 2015. Continued concern over \ufb01scal consolidation will hinder \nforeign investment and other capital in\ufb02ows. Notably, in February 2016 \nFitch\u00a0Ratings downgraded Sri Lanka to B+ from BB\u2013 with a negative \noutlook because of rising re\ufb01nancing risk and weaker public \ufb01nances. \nFiscal consolidation is to be put back on track by a revision of the \n2016 budget. Following the suspension in January 2016 of earlier plans \nfor tax reform, the government has been preparing a revised budget \nfor 2016. Its proposed tax reforms include a VAT rate increase to 15% \nfrom 11% and the introduction of a capital gains tax. The revised budget \nwill be the basis for discussions with the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) for possible support that interests the government. IMF support, \nonce agreed, will protect against expected pressures from external \nimbalances as it builds international con\ufb01dence and facilitates \ufb01scal \nconsolidation and tax reform.\n\nA national development strategy will facilitate investment, both \ndomestic and foreign. The Prime Minister outlined the government\u2019s \nstrategy in his statement in November, which focused on job creation, \nrural development, linking up to global value chains, and attracting \nmore foreign direct investment. The 2016 budget builds on these \npriorities and introduces some measures necessary to attract foreign \ninvestment. The master plan for the Western Region Megapolis \nProject, released in January 2016, elaborates on the development plan \nfor Western Province, including Colombo, which will be a signi\ufb01cant \ncomponent of capital expenditure over the medium term. The public \ninvestment plan for 2016\u20132018 to be published in May 2016 will \nprioritize and streamline public projects, provide vision for economic \ndevelopment, and thus promote private sector investment. \n\nPrivate investment can recover to drive economic growth in 2016, \nassuming that the revised budget is approved in mid-2016, the national \ndevelopment strategy is \ufb01nalized, and agreement is reached with the \nIMF on possible support.

Public investment has potential to expand once additional revenue \nstreams materialize. Under these circumstances, there is room for \nprivate sector investment to lead growth. In this scenario, economic \ngrowth is projected to pick up to 5.3% in 2016 and further to 5.8% in \n2017 as the global environment improves. \n\nIn\ufb02ation will accelerate moderately under monetary tightening. \nWhile domestic demand remains restrained, the 9% depreciation of the \nSri Lanka rupee in 2015 will exert upward pressure on import prices. \nThe fading of base effects from several reductions to administered \nenergy prices in 2015 may also cause some upward movement in \nin\ufb02ation in 2016. Monetary policy will maintain a tight stance balanced \nbetween restraining price increases and fostering economic recovery. \nWith global oil prices holding down domestic fuel prices, and assuming \na steady supply of agriculture products, in\ufb02ation is expected to rise only \nmoderately. Accordingly, in\ufb02ation is forecasted to pick up to 4.5% in \n2016 and, as growth strengthens, to 5.0% in 2017. \n\nThe overall balance of payments will continue to be under pressure \n\nas exports stay weak during the global slowdown and remittances \nslacken from workers in the Middle East. Although exports will \ncontinue to struggle, a positive factor is the expected renewal in 2016 of \nconcessions under the Generalized System of Preferences Plus scheme \nof the European Union. Imports will contract as oil prices decline and \nvehicle imports subside in response to the import tax. Receipts from \ntourism will continue to grow at a healthy rate in line with recent \ntrends. Given this outlook, the current account de\ufb01cit is projected to \nwiden slightly to 2.0% of GDP in 2016 and improve in 2017 to 1.8% as \nexports pick up. \n\nThe government\u2019s commitment to \ufb01scal consolidation is critical \nto ensure capital in\ufb02ow. IMF support would help the government to \nmaintain sufficient gross international reserves to sustain public and \ninvestor con\ufb01dence. The overall balance of payments is likely to remain \nin de\ufb01cit for the second consecutive year in 2016. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014tax reform\nA persistently low revenue ratio has been a major challenge to \nSri\u00a0Lanka\u2019s efforts to achieve \ufb01scal consolidation while meeting growing \nneeds for social expenditure and public investment. The ratio of tax \nto GDP is, at 12%, uniquely low among countries at a similar stage of \ndevelopment. The tax system is quite complex, with a multiplicity of \ntaxes. A relatively thin base re\ufb02ects signi\ufb01cant base erosion as various \ngovernment offices granted an array of tax incentives. The government\u2019s \nrepeated attempts to improve the tax system have had little impact. \nThe\u00a0Prime Minister\u2019s statement to Parliament in November 2015 \nindicated that he intended to address this issue partly by strengthening \ntax management and removing tax holidays and bene\ufb01ts.

The budget proposed expanding the tax \nbase for the VAT and the NBT by lowering the minimum tax liability \nthreshold and doubling the NBT rate. Indirect taxes in general place \na smaller burden on tax administration and can immediately increase \nrevenue, but they are regressive in that they impose a larger burden on \nthe poor than the rich. Further, since the NBT is levied on turnover, the \nburden cascades and has a larger distortionary effect on the economy \nthan does a VAT. \n\nMoreover, personal income tax will became less progressive as the \nrate is uni\ufb01ed at 15% from six bands: 4%, 8%, 12%, 16%, 20%, and 24%. \nCorporate tax rates were reformed to two bands\u201415% broadly and 30% \napplicable to a few selected activities including betting and gaming, \nliquor, tobacco, and banking and \ufb01nancial services\u2014from the previous \nstructure of 12% for incomes below SLRs5 million and 28% for higher \nincomes. The annual tax-free threshold for the personal income tax was \nincreased to SLRs2.4 million from SLRs750,000, further narrowing \nthe tax base. These proposals run counter to the policy outlined by the \nPrime Minister. \n\nProposed tax amendments in March 2016 address progressivity in \nthe tax system. The Prime Minister announced to Parliament details \nof his proposed tax amendments. The proposal is to change the VAT \nto a 15% single rate that will not be imposed on essential commodities \nor electricity (though VAT concessions for telecommunications, private \neducation, and private health expenditure will be removed), keep the \nNBT tax rate at 2%, and introduce a capital gains tax. The 2016 budget \nproposals on personal income tax and corporate tax are to be suspended. \nThe statutory personal income tax rate to be applied from 2017 is \nincreased from 15.0% to 17.5%. \n\nThe government has taken well-considered steps to enhance revenue. \n\nFurther improving the tax system requires stronger policy analysis \nand more capacity in decision-making agencies. The Inland Revenue \nDepartment needs to set up a comprehensive tax policy analysis unit \nwith the capacity to conduct statistical modelling and social surveys. \nSuch analysis will inform policy makers on the impact of tax policy \nchanges on revenue and the economy and facilitate tax administration \npolicy analysis, intervention, and equitable revenue generation.\n\n\f\fSOUThEAST ASIA\n\nDEMOCrATIC rEPUBLIC\n\nBrUNEI DArUSSALAM\nCAMBODIA\nINDONESIA\nLAO PEOPLE\u2019S \n \nMALAYSIA\nMYANMAr\nPhILIPPINES\nSINgAPOrE\nThAILAND\nVIET NAM\n\n\fBrunei Darussalam\n\nSlight  gains  in  oil  and  gas  production  in  2015  slowed  the  pace  of  GDP  contraction  and,  if \nmaintained,  are  expected  to  restore  GDP  growth  this  year.  Consumer  prices,  after  easing  in  2014 \nand  2015,  are  forecast  to  edge  up.  Lower  oil  and  gas  prices  will  likely  push  the  current  account \ninto  deficit  in  2016.  They  also  provide  an  opportunity  to  rein  in  energy  subsidies.\n\nEconomic performance \nHeavily dependent on exports of oil and natural gas, the economy \ncontracted by an estimated 1.1% in 2015 (Figure 3.22.1). The pace of \nGDP contraction slowed from declines of 2.1% in 2013 and 2.3% in\u00a02014 \nas oil and gas output edged up in 2015 after declining for several years. \nCrude oil production rose by 0.2% to 126,800 barrels per day and \nnatural gas output by 4.9% to 1.4 billion cubic feet per day, owing largely \nto the completion of maintenance on some aging wells and pipelines \n(Figure\u00a03.22.2). \n\nOil and gas accounts for more than 60% of GDP and 90% of both \n\nmerchandise exports and government revenue. While hydrocarbon \nproduction rose a little last year, export prices plunged, sharply reducing \nexport income and \ufb01scal revenue. The rest of the economy\u2014mainly \nservices and construction\u2014contracted by 2.3% in the \ufb01rst 3 quarters of \n2015, the latest period for which data are available, and likely contracted \nin the full year (Figure 3.22.3). Services, particularly those provided \nby the government, contracted, but construction expanded as the \ngovernment built infrastructure and housing projects.\n\nOn the demand side, investment, government consumption, and \nnet exports all shrank in the \ufb01rst 3 quarters, but private consumption \nrecorded solid growth.\n\nGovernment spending was constrained by falling revenue from \ntaxes, dividends, and royalties from oil and gas. Estimated revenue \ndropped by about half in FY2015 (ending 31 March 2016). The \ngovernment responded by cutting expenditure by more than 25%, in \npart by postponing smaller capital outlays. The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit in FY2015 \nis estimated at 14% of GDP, a sharp contrast with large surpluses \nexceeding 20% of GDP a few years ago (Figure 3.22.4). The de\ufb01cit was \n\ufb01nanced by transfers from a \ufb01scal stabilization fund.\n\nFalling prices for oil and gas exports cut the trade surplus by more \n\nthan half, and the current account surplus narrowed to an estimated \n6.5% of GDP in 2015. Merchandise exports on a customs basis fell \nby 42.9% to $6.3 billion, and merchandise imports fell by 17.1% to \n$3.0\u00a0billion (Figure 3.22.5). International reserves were, at $2.9 billion, \ndown by 16.9% from 2014 but still covered a high 11.4 months of imports.\n\nThis chapter was written by Shikha Jha and Pilipinas Quising of the Economic Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n \n%\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n1.5\n\n1.4\n\n1.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\n3.22.1\u2002GDP growth\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\nEstimate\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.22.2\u2002Average daily production\n\nNatural gas\n\nCrude oil\n\nBillion cubic feet\n\nThousand barrels\n\n250\n\n220\n\n190\n\n160\n\n130\n\n100\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\nSources: BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2015; \nDepartment of Energy.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nBrunei Darussalam\u2002\u2002197\n\n3.22.3\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nConsumer prices declined for a second year in a row.

Over the year, the consumer price \nindex fell by 0.4%. \n\nGrowth in credit to the private sector slowed further to 3.1% at the \nend of 2015. Money supply (M2) declined by 1.8%. In October 2015, the \nmonetary authority relaxed some conditions on unsecured personal \ncredit. The Brunei dollar, which is pegged at par to the Singapore dollar, \ndepreciated by 6.5% against the US dollar in 2015.

GDP is \nforecast to edge up by 1.0% this year and accelerate to 2.5% in 2017 if \nglobal demand and prices for hydrocarbons start to recover. \n\nConstruction will contribute to growth. The $100 million Sungai \nKebun Bridge is to be completed this year, and construction on a bridge \nto Pulau Muara Besar, an island in Brunei Bay to be developed as an \nindustrial hub, is expected to run through 2018. Work has started \non the $1.1 billion Temburong Bridge to connect the Brunei Muara \ndistrict with Temburong. This large project will continue through 2019. \nSite\u00a0preparation and dredging is under way for a $2.5 billion oil re\ufb01nery \nand aromatics cracker on Pulau Muara Besar. This project, planned \nby a company from the People\u2019s Republic of China, has been delayed, \nbut construction could start during the forecast period. Commercial \nproduction is scheduled from 2019. \n\nThe impact that low oil and gas prices has on government revenue \nindicates that spending on public services and smaller capital projects \nwill remain constrained. The FY2016 budget cuts total spending by \n12.5% from the previous year\u2019s budget. Revenue is projected to fall \nfurther, and the budget is expected to post another deep de\ufb01cit in \nFY2016. The budget puts a higher priority on spending that stimulates \nthe economy, such as infrastructure construction and maintenance and \nthe development of small and medium-sized enterprises. Accumulated \n\ufb01nancial assets provide a buffer against declines in revenue.\n\nThe government will push ahead with efforts to diversify the \neconomy through foreign investment in export-oriented ventures. \nNew\u00a0foreign investments include a $52 million plant being built by \nJapanese companies to supply pipes and tubing for the petroleum \nindustry and a $17 million organic farm proposed by investors from \nSingapore and Taipei,China. To attract investment the government \nhas reduced the corporate tax rate to 18.5% and introduced a tax \ncredit equal to 50% of salaries paid to new local employees in the \ufb01rst \n3 years of employment.

The higher ranking followed government moves to improve \nonline procedures and simplify registration requirements for starting \na business and to make it easier and less costly to pay business taxes. \nUnder new registration procedures, a business can be started in only \n1 day. In addition, the government established its Brunei Darussalam \nArbitration Center to resolve commercial disputes and drafted a new \ncompetition law that it said aligns with international best practice.\n\nConsumer prices are forecast to rise slightly as economic growth \npicks up. The depreciation of the Brunei dollar against the US dollar \nwill exert some upward pressure on prices. The consumer price index \nfell by 1.2% year on year in January 2016 but, for the year as a whole, \nis forecast to rise by 0.2% (Figure 3.22.6). Subsidies and price controls \nkeep in\ufb02ation low in this economy. \n\nLower global oil and gas prices this year will further diminish the \n\nvalue of merchandise exports. Next year, some recovery in oil prices \nshould see exports start to recover. Imports are expected to rise a little \nin 2016 and more so in 2017. The current account is forecast to fall into \nde\ufb01cit this year, returning to surplus in 2017.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reducing fuel subsidies\nInternational studies show that subsidies on fossil fuels and electricity \nnot only impose a burden on government budgets but also divert funds \nfrom more productive investment in physical and social infrastructure. \nMoreover, subsidies arti\ufb01cially lower the price of energy, encouraging \nhigher consumption and discouraging the development of alternative \nenergy sources. They disproportionately bene\ufb01t higher-income earners \nwho own cars and air-condition their homes. \n\nBrunei Darussalam\u2019s subsidies on fuel and power cost almost \n$400 million in 2014, or $900 per person, based on estimates by the \nInternational Energy Agency. The subsidy on gasoline has kept the \nretail price, in US dollars, around $0.40 per liter over the past decade. \nThat\u00a0compares with a retail price per liter of $0.98 in the US and \n$1.58\u00a0in Singapore in 2014 (Figure 3.22.7). \n\nThe sharp decline in oil prices provides an opportunity to rein in \nsubsidies without causing steep increases in fuel prices for consumers. \nIndeed, the minister of energy and industry noted in 2015 that subsidies \nleft people with little awareness of the true value of energy, adding that \nit was important to educate people away from dependence on subsidies \nand to \ufb01nd innovative alternatives to traditional approaches. \n\nThe government has started to address the issue by introducing \nprogressive electricity tariffs for residential users. This system charges \nB$0.01 per kilowatt hour (kWh) for consumption up to 500 kWh, \nB$0.10\u00a0per kWh for higher consumption to 1,500 kWh, and B$0.15 \nper kWh for consumption beyond 1,500 kWh. Thus, electricity is still \nsubsidized but less so for bigger consumers. The government says this \nsystem has encouraged consumers to use electricity more efficiently \nand reduced electricity consumption by 15%. It is considering extending \nprogressive tariffs to commercial users.\n\n%\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n\u201325\n\n\u201350\n\n%\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.5\n\n\u20131.0\n\n$/liter\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n3.22.5\u2002Merchandise trade\n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\nTrade balance\n\n$ billion\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u221210\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company Ltd (accessed 15 Feb 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.22.6\u2002Inflation\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.22.7\u2002Oil and gasoline prices\n\nBRU premium RON92 gasoline retail price\nUS premium gasoline retail price\nBrent crude oil spot price\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\nBRU = Brunei Darussalam, RON = research octane \nnumber, US = United States.\nSources: Ministry of Finance; Bloomberg; IMF Statistical \nAppendix on Brunei Darussalam (various years); US Energy \nInformation.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fCambodia\n\nExpansion  in  industry  and  services  sustained  solid  economic  growth  in  2015.  Inflation  slowed  to \nits  lowest  rate  since  2009  but  picked  up  at  the  end  of  the  year.  The  outlook  is  for  further  robust \ngrowth led by garment and footwear manufacturing, construction, and services, and for moderate \ninflation.  Rapid  growth  in  credit  and  a  real  estate  boom  have  heightened  risks  in  the  financial \nsector.  Another  challenge  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  employment. \n\nEconomic performance \nIndustry, particularly garment and footwear manufacturing and \nconstruction, contributed strongly to 7.0% economic growth in 2015, \nas did services (Figure 3.23.1). Agriculture was virtually \ufb02at because \nof\u00a0drought. \n\nCambodia\u2019s large supply of inexpensive, low-skilled labor has \n\nattracted substantial foreign direct investment (FDI) into the \nproduction of garments and footwear for export. Growth in such \nmanufacturing accelerated to 9.8% last year. Meanwhile, growth in \nconstruction moderated from 2014 but was still buoyant at 19.2% in 2015. \nWith\u00a0expansion estimated at 11.7%, industry overall was the biggest \ncontributor to GDP growth last year.\n\nServices, the second biggest contributor to growth, grew by an \nestimated 7.1%. Strong domestic demand spurred expansion in real \nestate and business services at almost 12%. Finance, transport and \ncommunications, and wholesale and retail trade all grew by about 8%. \nTourist arrivals rose by 6.1% in 2015, which was somewhat slower \nthan in the previous year owing to declines in visitors from Japan, the \nRepublic of Korea, and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, as well as \nslower growth in arrivals from other major markets (Figure 3.23.2). \nAgriculture, by contrast, grew by just 0.2% as El Ni\u00f1o brought \ndry weather. The rice harvest was broadly unchanged from 2014. \nProduction\u00a0of maize and soya beans fell, but cassava output jumped \nby\u00a0half, and natural rubber output rose slightly. \n\nDomestic demand remained strong, accommodated by low in\ufb02ation \n\nand high credit growth. In\ufb02ation averaging 1.2% in 2015, the lowest \nsince 2009, was restrained by falling global oil prices and subdued food \nprices. By the end of the year, though, in\ufb02ation had picked up to 2.8% \n(Figure 3.23.3). \n\nNet FDI rose to an estimated $1.8 billion last year, up by 8% from \n2014 and equal to 10% of GDP. Higher foreign investment in banks and \nmicro\ufb01nance institutions was notable. \n\nThis chapter was written by Jan Hansen and Samphors Khieu of the Cambodia Resident \nMission, ADB, Phnom Penh.

Public revenue as a share of GDP was little changed at \n17.1%, after having increased signi\ufb01cantly in 2014 with improved tax \ncollection. Expenditure as a share of GDP fell to an estimated 19.5% \nof GDP from 20.7%, partly the result of underspending in the capital \nbudget. Government deposits in the banking system, which can be \ndrawn down during economic shocks to implement \ufb01scal policy in the \nabsence of a domestic bond market, continued to rise last year, reaching \nan estimated KR6.7 billion, equal to 9.1% of GDP.\n\nThe monetary authorities kept the reserve requirement on foreign \n\ncurrency bank deposits, the main monetary policy tool, at 12.5% last \nyear. However, they expanded reserve requirements to cover banks\u2019 \nforeign borrowings, to stem high growth in credit. Estimates indicate \nthat growth in credit to the private sector moderated to 27.1% from \n31.3% in 2014, and growth in the money supply (M2) halved to 14.7% \nfrom 29.9% (Figure 3.23.5). The Cambodian riel was broadly stable \nagainst the US dollar. Dollarization remained high, with a ratio of \nforeign currency deposits to broad money at 83% in 2015. \n\nin 2015. Shipments of garments and footwear, which comprise 70% \nof total exports, rose by an estimated 10.2%. Rice exports also rose. \nMerchandise imports increased by an estimated 11.9% to $11.9 billion, \ndespite lower oil prices, as imports for the garment industry rose steeply. \nA smaller trade de\ufb01cit and higher remittances narrowed the current \naccount de\ufb01cit excluding official transfers to an estimated 11.1% of GDP. \nThis gap was largely \ufb01nanced by FDI. \n\nGross international reserves rose by 16% to $5.1 billion. \n\nWhile\u00a0reserves equivalent to 4.4 months of imports appear adequate, \nhigh dollarization and \ufb01nancial vulnerabilities in the economy \nargue for building additional reserves to strengthen resilience under \nexternal\u00a0shocks.\n\nAn International Monetary Fund analysis of debt sustainability \nin November 2015 found Cambodia at low risk of debt distress but \nvulnerable to shocks to growth, exports, and the budget. External public \ndebt rose from $5.3 billion in 2014 to an estimated $5.7 billion in 2015, \nequal to 31.1% of GDP. Cambodia has practically no domestic debt.\n\nEconomic prospects \nSteady economic growth of 7.0% is projected for 2016, with the pace \nquickening slightly in 2017 (Figure 3.23.6). Services are forecast to \nexpand by 7.8% this year on robust growth in wholesale and retail \ntrade, real estate and business services, and \ufb01nance. Industry is seen \ngrowing by 9.5%, supported by diversi\ufb01cation in garments and footwear \ntoward products with higher value added.

Growth in bank lending for construction \nand real estate-related activities eased from a very rapid 45.0% \nyear on year in the \ufb01rst quarter of 2015 but was still high at 34.3% \nin the fourth\u00a0quarter, comprising 19% of total credit.

To counter external \nshocks, the government has rebuilt some \ufb01scal space, but room for \nmonetary policy to support growth is constrained by high dollarization \nand a consequent lack of monetary control.

However, the growth model of attracting FDI to take \nadvantage of inexpensive, low-skilled, and abundant labor may not be \nviable for much longer. Generating more good jobs to sustain growth \nand raise incomes depends on diversifying the economy with new \nindustries that will require a different and wider range of skills. \n\nLabor force participation is high and a large proportion of the labor \n\nforce is employed, but many jobs are informal, vulnerable, unstable, \nand poorly rewarded. To improve the quality of employment there is \na critical need to address shortcomings in education and training and \nto\u00a0help children complete school. \n\nWhile 98% of children attend primary school, many drop out for lack \n\nof funds or because they expect low economic returns from education. \nOnly\u00a030% of young people complete high school. Low\u00a0enrollment \nin secondary and higher education, and its poor quality, has left \na mismatch between young workers\u2019 skills and employers\u2019 needs. \nSubstantial bene\ufb01ts would likely result from improving the skills of \nthose already in the workforce. \n\nAs for children still in school, preparing them for technical and \nvocational education and training, higher education, and employment \nwill require upgrading the physical infrastructure of schools, \nmodernizing curricula and textbooks, and improving teaching skills, \nparticularly at the secondary level in math and science. \n\nCoordinating general education with technical training would \nensure that the two streams are complementary options for students. \nBetter implementation of the quali\ufb01cation framework that was approved \nby the government in 2014 and collaboration with the private sector \ncould link education and training across all levels and respond better to \nthe skills needs of industry. \n\n\fIndonesia\n\nStronger  public  investment  is  expected  to  pull  the  economy  out  of  a  slowdown  that  persisted \nin  2015.  The  government  has  increased  infrastructure  funding  and  unveiled  policy  reforms  to \nstimulate  private  investment.  Lower  interest  rates  will  help.  Inflation  is  forecast  to  decelerate  by \nalmost  2  percentage  points  this  year.  Further  reforms  are  needed  to  boost  productivity,  attract \ninvestment,  and  stimulate  new  sources  of  growth.\n\nEconomic performance \nDespite a pickup in government spending that lifted economic growth \nin the second half of 2015, the pace of GDP growth for the year was, at \n4.8%, the slowest since 2009. \n\nGrowth in private consumption, by far the biggest contributor \nto GDP growth, decelerated to 4.8% last year on a decline in rural \nincomes, higher in\ufb02ation, tighter consumer credit, and a weaker \nlabor market (Figure 3.24.1). Rural incomes were hurt by lower \nprices for agricultural\u00a0products and drought caused by El Ni\u00f1o. \nPrivate\u00a0consumption got some support in the second half from increases \nin government funding for village funds and pay rises for civil servants.\nGrowth in \ufb01xed investment improved to 5.1% as the government \n\nramped up investment in infrastructure and introduced a series of \nreforms to revive private investment (Figure 3.24.2). After facing \ndelays in the \ufb01rst half, public investment rose sharply in the second, \nassisted by the government\u2019s improved performance in executing \ncapital expenditure. Encouragingly, the ratio of \ufb01xed investment to \nGDP increased to 33.2%. Government consumption spending also rose, \nrecovering from a slowdown in 2014 to expand by 5.4% in 2015 on \nimproved budget execution. \n\nnet external demand made a small contribution to GDP growth in 2015 \nas imports in real terms contracted by 5.8% on lackluster domestic \ndemand and Indonesian rupiah depreciation.\n\nServices, the biggest supply-side contributor to GDP growth, \ngrew by 5.5% in 2015, easing from 6.0% in 2014. In particular, growth \nslowed sharply in wholesale and retail trade, re\ufb02ecting moderation in \nprivate consumption. By contrast, information and communications \nmaintained double-digit expansion. Manufacturing grew by 4.2%, the \nslowest pace in several years. As the property market softened, growth \nin construction moderated to 6.6% despite the upturn in infrastructure \nspending.

Fewer than \n200,000 jobs were created in the 12 months to August 2015, during \nwhich the working-age population aged 15 years and over increased \nby\u00a03.1 million. The labor force participation rate fell to 65.8% in \nAugust\u00a02015, the lowest on record, and the unemployment rate rose to \n6.2% in August 2015 from 5.9% a year earlier, with youth unemployment \nclimbing to 22.6%. \n\nIn\ufb02ation ebbed gradually from 8.4% at the end of 2014, then \n\ndecelerated sharply in late 2015 as the impact of a 2014 fuel price hike \nfaded (Figure 3.24.4). By December, in\ufb02ation had subsided year on \nyear to 3.4%. Core in\ufb02ation, excluding food and fuel, eased to 4.0% in \nDecember. Nevertheless, year-average in\ufb02ation remained high at 6.4% in \n2015 owing to the 2014 fuel price hike, El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought, import \nrestrictions on some food staples, and rupiah depreciation. \n\nHigher food prices, lower rural incomes, and the weaker labor market \n\ncaused the incidence of poverty to worsen to 11.1% in September\u00a02015. \nInequality as measured by the Gini coefficient remained elevated at 0.41 \nnationally.\n\nBank Indonesia, the central bank, reduced its policy interest rate \nby 25 basis points to 7.50% in February 2015, then kept the policy rate \nunchanged for 11 months to foster exchange rate stability and combat \ncapital out\ufb02ows. Growth in credit slowed to 10.5%. After in\ufb02ation \ndecelerated in the last quarter of 2015, the central bank reduced the \npolicy rate by 75 basis points to 6.75% in the \ufb01rst quarter of 2016. \nThe\u00a0monetary authorities also cut the reserve requirement for banks in \nDecember 2015 and March 2016 to stimulate bank lending. \n\nThe government pushed ahead with planned spending on \ninfrastructure and social development in 2015 even as subdued \neconomic activity and lower commodity prices caused budget revenue to \ndecline. This widened the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit to 2.5% of GDP from 1.9% in the \nbudget and 2.1% in 2014. Standard & Poor\u2019s, citing improved \ufb01scal policy \ncredibility, revised up its credit rating outlook for Indonesia to positive \nfrom stable in May 2015. \n\nMerchandise exports fell by 15.4% in US dollar terms, weighed \ndown by sagging demand in major markets and lower prices for export \ncommodities. Merchandise imports fell in US dollar terms by an even \nsteeper 19.8% because of subdued investment, rupiah depreciation, and \nlower oil imports. Consequently, the trade surplus almost doubled to \n$13.3 billion, which, coupled with lower de\ufb01cits in services and primary \nincome, narrowed the current account de\ufb01cit to $17.8 billion, equal to \n2.1% of GDP (Figure 3.24.5). \n\nForeign direct investment in\ufb02ows were, at $15.5 billion in 2015, \nthe lowest in 5 years, and net portfolio investment of $16.7 billion was \ndown by just over one-third from 2014. A smaller surplus in the capital \nand \ufb01nancial account relative to the previous year tipped the balance \nof payments into de\ufb01cit by $1.1 billion.

Higher public capital spending should provide additional \nopportunities for private investment, which, together with the \nimplementation of structural reform, will improve the investment \nclimate. Household spending is projected to pick up, but net external \ndemand could weigh on economic growth. On balance, the economy is \nseen expanding by 5.2% in 2016 and 5.5% next year (Figure 3.24.7). \n\nThe 2016 budget sees further improvement in the composition \nof public spending (Figure 3.24.8). Energy subsidies are projected to \ndecline by 14% from 2015, freeing up resources for infrastructure, health \ncare, and social protection. To this end, the government has raised its \nallocation for infrastructure by 7.4% from 2015. Local governments \nwill receive higher transfers from the central government and are \nbeing encouraged to use accumulated surpluses for public investment. \nThe\u00a02016 budget also injects additional capital into state-owned \nenterprises involved in infrastructure, and some state enterprises get \ngovernment guarantees to facilitate borrowing from international \n\ufb01nancial institutions. \n\nAiming for higher rates of budget realization, officials advanced the \n\nbidding process for public investment projects. By the end of January \n2016, the government had completed the bidding process for 53% of \nthe capital spending planned by central government ministries. Several \ninfrastructure projects, notably in telecommunications and roads, \ncommenced in the \ufb01rst quarter of 2016.\n\nThe government targets an ambitious 21% increase in revenue over \n\nthe outcome in 2015, which will require signi\ufb01cant improvements \nin tax collection. Excise tariffs have been raised, and a partial tax \namnesty is planned for those who declare and repatriate offshore funds. \nAgainst\u00a0this, low oil and commodity prices will continue to constrain \nrevenue this year. The government anticipates a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit equal to \n2.2% of GDP in 2016\u2014though, as in 2015, the outcome is expected to \nexceed the target. \n\nPolicy reforms are expected to stimulate private investment, \nparticularly over the medium term. The government has unveiled \n10\u00a0packages of such reforms since September 2015. The central bank \nis expected to maintain its focus on macroeconomic stability, though \nslower in\ufb02ation over the forecast period could provide room for further \nreductions in interest rates to spur growth. \n\nHousehold consumption is projected to improve slightly on easing \nin\ufb02ation, tax cuts for lower-income workers from July 2015, and higher \ngovernment allocations for village funds, which hire rural workers \nto build village infrastructure. These factors will help to mitigate the \nlingering impact of El Ni\u00f1o on farm incomes.

Likewise, the \ndecline in imports that has been under way since 2013 is expected to \nslow as investment gathers momentum. The current account de\ufb01cit is \nforecast to widen over the next 2 years, but the balance of payments may \nwell return to surplus on stronger capital in\ufb02ows that should follow a \nbetter economic performance and strong implementation of investment \nreforms. Foreign holdings of rupiah bonds rose by $2.9 billion in the \n\ufb01rst 11 weeks of 2016, and the rupiah appreciated by 5.1% against the \nUS\u00a0dollar in this period.\n\nBy sector, services are expected to bene\ufb01t this year as lower in\ufb02ation \n\nand interest rates bolster consumer and business sentiment. Stronger \nspending on infrastructure will lift construction. The\u00a0manufacturing \npurchasing managers\u2019 index in February appears to have bottomed\u00a0out, \nand this indicates a potential upturn in the months ahead (Figure\u00a03.24.11). \nAs for agriculture, farmers postponed crop sowing late\u00a0in 2015 to wait out \nthe drought, which will hurt harvests in the \ufb01rst\u00a0half of 2016. \n\nDamage to agriculture from drought has put upward pressure on \nfood prices, with in\ufb02ation edging up to 4.3% year on year in the \ufb01rst \n2 months of 2016. The government has approved imports of rice to \ndampen price increases. The rupiah\u2019s depreciation in 2015 is expected \nto have a modest impact on in\ufb02ation this year. Year-average in\ufb02ation \nis seen at 4.5% in 2016, down almost 2 percentage points from 6.4% in \neach of the past 3 years (Figure 3.24.12). \n\nDomestic risks to the outlook are posed by delays in public \n\ninfrastructure projects, including from possible shortfalls in government \nrevenue. Delays in implementing infrastructure projects would hurt \nbusiness con\ufb01dence. In this regard, it will be important that reforms \nannounced in 2015 are \ufb01rmly implemented. An unexpected spike in \nin\ufb02ation, perhaps caused by tight food supplies, could dent consumption \nand investor sentiment. External risks include weaker-than-anticipated \ngrowth in trading partners, which would further depress exports, and \ncontinued weakness in prices for export commodities.

From September 2015 to February 2016, \nthe government unveiled 10 packages of reforms to attract investment, \nparticularly in manufacturing. It opened an additional 35 sectors \nto foreign ownership, eliminated or simpli\ufb01ed various regulations, \nimproved procedures for land title registration, and accelerated \nbusiness licensing. A new formula for setting minimum wages aims to \nmake annual adjustments more simple and predictable. Tax breaks are \nprovided to new manufacturing and labor-intensive industries, while \ncredit subsidies are expanded for small and medium-sized enterprises. \nPort logistics services are to be reformed, and special economic zones \nfurther developed. \n\nThe next priority should be to forcefully implement the reforms \nto ensure a positive impact on investor perceptions. In this respect, \ndecisions last year to raise tariffs on 5,000 products and require that all \ntransactions be made in rupiah may have countered some of the gains.\nThe reform agenda is incomplete. For example, policies are needed \nto foster micro and small enterprises. One in three such manufacturing \nenterprises cites inadequate \ufb01nance as its main constraint. Interventions \nto address the main issues\u2014high interest rates, cumbersome procedures, \nand lack of collateral\u2014have important roles to play in structural \nreform, as do upgrading technology and encouraging micro and small \nenterprises to form clusters to promote cooperation and economies \nof\u00a0scale. \n\nIndonesia\u2019s working-age population is projected to increase steadily \n\nthrough 2030. To take full advantage of this demographic dividend, \nfurther investment is needed in education and training that will help \nthe economy make the transition to activities that add more value. \nLonger\u00a0term, changes are required to improve the quality and relevance \nof education and training, and to address skill shortages and mismatches \nin the labor market (Figure 3.24.13). \n\nThe GDP share of trade in goods and services has declined over \nthe past decade, even as it has increased in most other Southeast Asian \neconomies. Although Indonesia is a large producer of palm oil, coal, \nrubber, and coffee, its total exports are less than 2% of global trade \nin goods and services. This points to the tremendous potential that \nexpanding trade has for boosting demand for Indonesian goods and \nservices, provided that a \ufb01rm commitment to openness and global \ncompetitiveness is maintained. The growing use of nontariff measures \nsuch as import and export restrictions, and of state interventions to \nstabilize domestic commodity markets, ultimately weakens external \ncompetitiveness and should be reconsidered. \n\nEconomic integration under the auspices of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations will add to competitive pressures but also \ncreate opportunities to integrate Indonesia more closely into one of the \nworld\u2019s most rapidly growing regions. \n\nIndex\n \n\n54\n\n52\n\n50\n\n48\n\n46\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3.24.11\u2002 Manufacturing purchasing \n\nmanagers\u2019 index\n\n0\n\n0\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nNote: Nikkei, Markit.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 18 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.24.12\u2002Inflation\n \n%\n8\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.24.13\u2002Skills mismatch, August 2015\n\n \nPercentage of the employed population\n60\n\nUnder quali\ufb01ed Well matched Over quali\ufb01ed\n\nSource: Statistics Indonesia. 2015.

Inflation \nhas  ebbed  to  its  lowest  in  6  years  and  is  forecast  to  remain  modest.  Lower  global  oil  prices  have \nhelped  to  bolster  a  fragile  external  position,  but  international  reserves  provide  only  a  thin  buffer \nagainst  external  shocks.\n\nEconomic performance \nExpansion in services and electricity generation sustained solid \neconomic growth in 2015, though the pace moderated for a second year \nin a row to an estimated 6.7%, largely owing to \ufb01scal constraints and \nlackluster global demand for minerals (Figure 3.25.1). \n\nServices, the biggest supply-side contributor to GDP growth, slowed \na little in 2015 but still grew by an estimated 8.5%. The number of bank \nbranches and micro\ufb01nance institutions continued to increase, and \ntelecommunications recorded moderate expansion. Tourism-related \nservices such as accommodation and transportation bene\ufb01tted as tourist \narrivals rose by 12.6% to 4.7 million and revenue from tourism increased \nby 13.1% to $725.4 million (Figure 3.25.2). \n\nIndustry grew by an estimated 8.0%, also coming off the pace set in \n\n2014. In\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment supported the construction \nof power plants, residential and commercial property, and projects in \nspecial economic zones. However, \ufb01scal constraints dampened public \nconstruction. Output of electricity, mostly sold to Thailand, rose after \nthe Hongsa lignite-\ufb01red power plant and new hydropower plants started \ncommercial production (Figure 3.25.3). Production of copper, gold, and \nsilver from the major mines edged up, but some potash mines closed.\n\nAlso slowing from 2014, agriculture expanded by an estimated 2.0% \nin 2015. Dry weather suppressed the production of rice, vegetables, and \n\ufb01sh in some parts of the country, and rice output nationwide rose by less \nthan 1%. Exports of forestry products fell by over 20%. \n\nGovernment spending has been constrained over the past 2 years \n\nby the need to curb the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit and repay arrears. Because the \n\ufb01scal gap, including grants but excluding off-budget items, widened \nsharply to equal 5.6% of GDP in FY2013 (ended 30 September 2013), \nthe government has since postponed some infrastructure investment, \ncurbed off-budget spending, and cancelled a hike in civil service wages \nand allowances. These measures started to rein in the de\ufb01cit in FY2014. \nHowever, as lower commodity prices weighed on revenue in FY2015, \nthe\u00a0\ufb01scal gap widened to an estimated 4.7% of GDP. \n\nThis chapter was written by Rattanatay Luanglatbandith and Soulinthone Leuangkhamsing \nof the Lao PDR Resident Mission, ADB, Vientiane.\n\n3.25.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.8\n\n7.9\n\n7.9\n\n7.4\n\n6.7\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSources: Lao Statistics Bureau; Asian Development Outlook \ndatabase.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.25.2\u2002Tourism indicators\n\nRevenue from tourism\n\nNumber of tourists\n\n$ million\n\n% change, year on year\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n750\n\n600\n\n450\n\n300\n\n150\n\n0\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: National Tourism Administration.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\u2002\u2002209\n\nAt about 16% over the past 2 years, credit growth has decelerated \n\n3.25.3\u2002Electricity output\n\nBillion kilowatt-hours\n\nfrom almost 36% in 2013, and the central bank has phased down its \ndirect lending for public infrastructure (Figure 3.25.4). Growth in \nthe money supply has also slowed. To stimulate lending to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, the central bank directed commercial banks \nto lower interest rates effective from August last year. The Lao kip \ndepreciated by 0.7% against the US dollar over 2015 but appreciated by \n8.3% against the Thai baht.\n\nLower global fuel and food prices brought down in\ufb02ation from 2.5% \n\nat the start of 2015 to 0.9% by December (Figure 3.25.5). Slower credit \ngrowth and \ufb01rmer control over \ufb01scal spending have helped to dampen \nin\ufb02ation over the past 2 years. In 2015, the average in\ufb02ation rate was, at \n1.3%, the lowest since 2009.  \n\nMerchandise exports, mainly electricity and minerals, fell by an \nestimated 7.1% in US dollar terms in 2015. Imports also fell in US dollar \nterms, by an estimated 5.8%, due to lower oil and commodity prices \nand more subdued domestic demand. The trade de\ufb01cit improved by an \nestimated 3% to $3.1 billion, and the current account de\ufb01cit narrowed to \nequal 20.3% of GDP. In\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment and earnings \nfrom tourism contributed to an increase in gross international reserves \nto an estimated $986.8 million in December 2015, which covers less than \n2 months of goods and services imports. \n\nExpenditure and consumption surveys show that the poverty rate fell \nfrom 33.5% in 2003 to 23.2% in 2013, the latest available data. After\u00a0gross \nnational income per capita surpassed $1,000 in 2011, the World Bank \nreclassi\ufb01ed the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao\u00a0PDR) as lower-\nmiddle income. The government aims to meet income, quality of life, and \neconomic vulnerability criteria by 2020 for eligibility to graduate from \nUnited Nations status as a least-developed country.\n\nEconomic prospects\nElectricity production is expected to maintain growth as more new \nhydropower plants come online this year and the 1.9 gigawatt Hongsa \nlignite-\ufb01red plant makes a full-year contribution to GDP. \n\nGrowth in construction will be underpinned by work on additional \n\nhydropower plants, including the 1.3 gigawatt Xayaburi project \nscheduled for commissioning in 2019, as well as by new commercial, \nindustrial, and residential developments. Robust expansion is projected \nfor services, driven by growth in tourism and development in \ufb01nance \nand telecommunications. Agriculture is projected to pick up in 2016, \nassuming better weather. However, mining is likely to be subdued in \nlight of soft global demand and prices for minerals.  \n\nThe impact of slowing growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) on Lao PDR trade and investment is countered in part by gradual \nrecovery forecast for Thailand\u2014which will lift Lao PDR exports, tourism, \nand remittances\u2014and by robust growth in Viet Nam. GDP growth could \nget a lift from next year if a planned $6.8 billion railway to link Vientiane \nwith Yunnan Province in the PRC goes ahead. This project, to be built \nand largely funded by the PRC, would stimulate other investment from \nthat source. It would also add to Lao PDR external debt. \n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: Ministry of Energy and Mines.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.25.4\u2002Monetary indicators \n\nDomestic credit \nMoney supply \n\nDomestic credit\n\n% change, year on year\n\nKN trillion\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: Bank of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.25.5\u2002Monthly inflation\n\n%, year on year\n\nJan\n2012\n\nJan\n2013\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f210\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nThe government has committed to restrain growth in administrative \n\n3.25.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nspending, including civil service salaries.

Compared with 2014, GDP growth decelerated by 1.0 \npercentage point, with slowdowns in consumption and \ufb01xed investment \nand a decline in net exports.\n\nPrivate consumption moderated last year, after several years \nof rapid expansion, to record growth at 6.0%, still robust enough \nto generate 3.1 percentage points of the growth in GDP. Household \nspending was dampened by the introduction of a goods and services \ntax (GST) in April\u00a02015 together with softening in the labor market as \nthe unemployment rate edged up from 2.9% to 3.2% in 2015, as well as \nby\u00a0slowing growth in credit to households. \n\nGrowth in government consumption spending eased to 4.3%, and \ngovernment \ufb01xed investment fell for a second year in a row, re\ufb02ecting \nthe completion of some large public projects and efforts to narrow \nthe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit.

Fixed investment \noverall rose by 3.7% in 2015, maintaining a slowing trend since 2012 \n(Figure\u00a03.26.2).

External demand \nwill remain subdued in 2016 as growth slows in the People\u2019s Republic \nof\u00a0China, Malaysia\u2019s second biggest export market, and economic activity \nstays sluggish in major industrial economies. Domestic demand will \ndrive growth, but it is dampened this year by softer labor and property \nmarkets, lower earnings from hydrocarbons and other commodities, \nhigher in\ufb02ation, high household debt, slower growth in credit, and \n\ufb01scal\u00a0tightening.\n\nThese factors will weigh on private consumption, which is projected \n\nto grow at a slower pace than in 2015. The government has taken \nsteps to cushion the slowdown in household spending. To\u00a0bolster \nincomes it reduced mandatory employee contributions to the national \nretirement fund from March 2016, trimmed some personal tax rates \nfrom January\u00a02016, and maintained a range of cash transfers. Further, \nthe government increased the number of items exempted from the GST. \nThe national minimum wage will rise from July 2016. Nevertheless, \nconsumer con\ufb01dence was low at the start of 2016 (Figure\u00a03.26.7).\n\nSlowing domestic demand and lackluster global prospects have \ntaken their toll on business sentiment. The business conditions index \ndeclined through last year, though it steadied in the fourth quarter \n(Figure 3.26.7). The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index shows \nlittle sign of sustained recovery after falling last year (Figure 3.26.8). \nIn February 2016, manufacturers indicated renewed deterioration in \noperating conditions, led by a fall in new domestic orders. Moreover, \nthe government\u2019s leading economic indicator pointed in January 2016 to \nslowing economic growth in the months ahead. \n\nOn the bright side, semiconductor book-to-bill ratios in \n\nNorth\u00a0America and Japan are trending up, which suggests improving \ndemand for electronic and electrical products (Figure 3.26.9).\n\nInfrastructure projects under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan will \nsupport growth in \ufb01xed investment. Government-linked companies, \nparticularly those in transportation and utilities, are expected to make \nsubstantial investments in the next 2 years. The government committed \nto push ahead with major infrastructure projects including mass rapid \ntransit and light railway systems. However, prospects are bleak for \ninvestment in oil and gas exploration and production, considering the \nplunge in hydrocarbon prices.

A fall in manufacturing capacity utilization last year from \n79.8% to 75.0% indicates slack capacity overall in manufacturing, though \ninvestment is continuing to expand in oil re\ufb01ning and petrochemicals \nand is expected to pick up in electronic and electrical products. \n\nFiscal policy intends to further narrow the budget de\ufb01cit in 2016 to \n3.1% of GDP. Falling oil prices prompted the government in January 2016 \nto revise down its revenue expectations and reduce budgeted operating \nand development expenditures. \n\nAs for monetary policy, the central bank lowered in January 2016 its \n\nreserve requirement for banks to support economic growth. In March, \nit reiterated that the policy interest rate at 3.25% supports economic \nactivity, suggesting the rate may remain there for some time. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is seen rising to average 2.7% in 2016 (Figure 3.26.10). \nLower energy prices are expected to be offset by increases in prices of \nadministered goods, higher road tolls, and higher prices for imports \nfrom ringgit depreciation. Dry weather from El Ni\u00f1o is expected to lift \nfood prices. In\ufb02ation jumped to 4.2% in February 2016, largely on a \ntemporary base effect caused by sharply lower in\ufb02ation in the \ufb01rst few \nmonths of 2015. From April, the impact of the GST will drop out of the \nyear-on-year in\ufb02ation rate. \n\nThe outlook for exports this year remains weak. External demand is \nsubdued and prices for export commodities remain low (Figure\u00a03.26.11). \nIn January 2016, customs-recorded exports fell by almost 20% in \nUS\u00a0dollar terms. Exports of mineral fuels and lubricants dropped by \n48%, and shipments of manufactured goods fell by 21%, including an \n11% fall in electronic and electrical products. The export performance \nis seen improving in 2017, assuming \ufb01rmer global demand and help \nfrom the more competitive ringgit exchange rate. Prices for export \ncommodities, too, are expected to rise next year. \n\nMerchandise imports continued to decline in January but are \nexpected to rise over this year, with the pace quickening in 2017 if \ninvestment picks up. Inbound tourism is likely to get a lift from relaxed \nvisa requirements starting in February 2016 for tourists from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. The current account surplus is forecast to \ndecline this year before rising in 2017 (Figure 3.26.12). \n\nDomestic and external uncertainties pose risks to the outlook, \nnotably disappointing demand for exports and renewed weakness in \noil and commodity prices. However, the economy\u2019s resilience under \nsuch developments is supported by its increasingly diversi\ufb01ed economic \nstructure (services and manufacturing now account for 75% of GDP), \nadequate international reserves, a \ufb02exible exchange rate, well-developed \ncapital markets, and steps taken to bolster the budget.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening the \ufb01scal\u00a0position\nMalaysia\u2019s budget has depended heavily on income from oil and gas, \nleaving it vulnerable to sharp declines in global prices for hydrocarbons. \nUntil recently, oil and gas revenue accounted for about a third of total \nbudget revenue. In the past 2 years, the government has taken two \nimportant steps to strengthen the \ufb01scal position: It introduced the GST \nto broaden the tax base and cut subsidies, particularly on fuel, to free up \nbudget resources for more productive purposes. \n\n3.26.9\u2002 Semiconductor book-to-bill ratios\n\nNorth America\nJapan\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nNote: The series is calculated as the ratio of the 3-month \naverage of bookings (orders) to the 3-month average of \nbillings (shipments).

This saving offset a \nsigni\ufb01cant drop in revenue caused by lower oil and gas prices. The GST, \nintroduced at a relatively low rate of 6% in April 2015, replaced sales \nand services taxes that raised the equivalent of 1.6% of GDP in 2014. \nThe\u00a0GST yielded about 3% of GDP in 2015. Nevertheless, the non-oil \n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cit in 2015 was still substantial at 7.0% of GDP, as the gain from \nthe GST was offset by higher development expenditure (Figure\u00a03.26.13). \nThe GST should improve the non-oil \ufb01scal balance starting in 2016, \n\nthough the near-term gains may be limited given the more subdued \ndomestic demand. The government plans to make the GST more \neffective by lowering the registration threshold to broaden the tax base. \nMeanwhile, however, it also has foregone revenue by extending the \nnumber of items that are excluded from GST. \n\nThe\u00a0excise tax on tobacco was raised by 40% in November 2015, and \npersonal income tax rates for high-income earners were increased \nfrom January 2016. The government\u2019s aim of a balanced budget \nby\u00a02020 may require further action on both revenue and expenditure. \nAmong\u00a0other possibilities, higher revenue could come from improving \nthe administration of personal and corporate income tax, raising the \nGST rate, or reducing tax exemptions. \n\nThe expenditure side would bene\ufb01t from further reductions and \nimproved targeting of subsidies, which include subsidies on cooking oil, \nassistance for education expenses, and cash transfers. These and other \nsubsidies still absorb 10% of budget operating expenditure. For example, \nthe BR1M cash transfer program for needy families could be targeted \nmore tightly. In March 2016, 7.1 million people, or almost a quarter of \nthe population, were approved to receive the cash transfer for this year, \nwhich is expected to cost RM5.9 billion. \n\n3.26.12\u2002Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n \n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\nExcluding oil\nOverall\n\n% of GDP\n\n2005\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\nForecast\n\nSources: ADB estimates using data from Ministry\u00a0of \nFinance Malaysia. 2016.

The\u00a0government \nhas laid out an ambitious \ufb01scal plan to, among other things, raise tax \nrevenue, make spending more efficient, and restructure state economic \nenterprises.\n\nIn\ufb02ation will moderate as agricultural recovery from the \ufb02oods \nbrings down food prices, but it is still projected to remain high at 9.5% \nin FY2016 and 8.5% in FY2017 (Figure 3.27.6).\n\nTo manage rapid growth in credit, the central bank is preparing to \n\nstrengthen bank supervision and prudential controls and to improve \nthe functioning of the interbank money market to provide benchmarks \nfor short-term lending rates. More reforms for \ufb01nance and business are \nexpected in 2016 (Box 3.27.1). Maintaining exchange rate \ufb02exibility will \nbe crucial, as measures to resist depreciation have so far been largely \ncounterproductive and a drain on reserves. The incoming government \nhas indicated it will strengthen the autonomy of the central bank and \ndevelop stronger monetary policy tools.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is seen narrowing to 8.3% of GDP \n\nin FY2016 (Figure 3.27.7). Stronger economic growth will drive up \nimports, but this will be countered somewhat by lower prices for \nimported oil. Exports of agricultural products will rebound, and those \nof manufactured products will continue to grow, but gas export prices \nremain under downward pressure. Vulnerabilities in the \ufb01scal and \nexternal accounts call for stronger efforts to build up official reserves to \nmore comfortable levels.\n\nExternal debt is projected to rise to $11.2 billion in FY2016, equal to \n\n15.7% of GDP. Myanmar\u2019s risk of debt distress is expected to remain low, \nhowever, as most debt is on concessional terms and the government has \nbeen cutting back on commercial borrowing. \n\n3.27.1\u2002 Reforms for \ufb01nance \nand\u00a0business\n\nIn January 2016, Parliament passed \nthe amended Banks and Financial \nInstitutions Law, which lays the \nfoundations for more efficient \nlicensing of \ufb01nancial institutions, \na modern \ufb01nancial sector, and its \nenhanced supervision. The law sets \nguidelines for domestic and foreign \nbanks, including more stringent \nrules on paid-up capital and reserve \nrequirements. Four foreign banks \nreceived licenses in March 2016, \nadding to the nine that were licensed \nin 2014. \n\nAn important reform for the \nbusiness environment will be the \nrati\ufb01cation expected in 2016 of a \nnew company law that incorporates \ninternational standards of corporate \ngovernance. The law will de\ufb01ne \na foreign company according to \na threshold of investment from \noverseas, which will allow foreign \nequity investment in Myanmar \ncompanies that are not joint ventures, \nas well as enable foreign \ufb01rms to \nparticipate in capital markets.\n\nThe new Yangon Stock Exchange \n\nstarted trading in March 2016, \ninitially with one company listed. \nFive more have been approved for \nlisting, and others have applied.\n\nDespite signi\ufb01cant economic reform since 2011, the new government \n\n3.27.6\u2002Inflation\n\nfaces daunting challenges. One is to maintain stability on the \nmacroeconomic front and in regions affected by con\ufb02ict. Another\u00a0is to \naddress de\ufb01cits in infrastructure and in human resources and capacity \nthat constrain social and economic development. A third challenge is \nto maintain and advance progress on reform to improve governance \nand strengthen public sector management, private sector development, \nand regional cooperation and integration. Combating poverty and \nchild\u00a0malnutrition remain high priorities, and anecdotal evidence \nsuggests that income inequality is worsening.

At least 60% of \nits trunk highways need maintenance or rehabilitation, as do most of \nits railways (Figure 3.27.8). Some 20 million people lack even basic \naccess by rural road, and river transport infrastructure hardly exists. \nDemand\u00a0is growing fast, with the number of vehicles on the roads \nmore\u00a0than doubling to 5 million from 2012 to 2015, and international \nair\u00a0passengers more than doubling to 3.2 million from 2011 to 2014.\nInvestment estimated at $60 billion is needed through 2030 to \nupgrade transport systems to a standard in line with other countries at \na similar stage of development. This means increasing transport sector \ninvestments to the equivalent of 3%\u20134% of GDP from little more than 1% \nin recent years.\n\nThe government\u2019s newly developed National Transport Master \nPlan envisages an efficient, modern, safe, and environmentally friendly \nsystem that covers all modes of transport. Under the plan, investment \nis required to upgrade the trunk road and rail networks, improve links \nwith neighboring countries, develop access to rural areas, provide public \ntransport in urban areas, and enhance intermodal transport networks \nand logistics. \n\nToward policy reform, a single transport ministry will help to \ncoordinate policy, planning, investment, management, and regulation. \nGiven the immense funding required, private sector resources could \nbe mobilized through the restructuring of concessions to operate \ntoll\u00a0roads, competitive outsourcing of civil works, and corporatizing \nor privatizing of state-owned enterprises and activities that operate in \ncompetitive\u00a0markets.\n\n3.27.8\u2002Transport challenges\n\nIncrease in travel time in Yangon\n(in the last 4 years)\n\n200%\n\nIncrease in vehicle \ufb02eet\n(in the last 4 years)\n\nIncrease in road accident fatalities\n(from 2009 to 2014)\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\nHighways in poor condition\n\n60%\n\nRailway operational costs\ncovered by fares\n\nPopulation without\nbasic road access\n\nInfrastructure costs\ncovered by road user fees\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n33%\n\nSource: ADB.

Growth is projected to pick up with higher investment and consumption. Inflation \nis  forecast  to  rise  moderately  as  dry  weather  from  El  Ni\u00f1o  presses  upward  on  food  prices  and \nutility  rates.  Sustaining  strong  growth  will  require  policy  continuity  supporting  the  development  of \ninfrastructure and human capital, improvements to the investment climate, and governance reform. \n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic growth moderated to 5.8% in 2015, a solid performance in \nthe face of weak external demand and damage to agriculture in\ufb02icted \nby typhoons and drought from El Ni\u00f1o. Growth strengthened in the \nsecond\u00a0half, reaching 6.3% in the fourth quarter.\n\nBroad-based domestic demand underpinned growth last year. \n\nGrowth in private consumption, which accounts for nearly 70% of GDP, \naccelerated to 6.2% and made the biggest contribution to overall growth \nfrom the demand side (Figure 3.28.1). Household spending bene\ufb01tted \nfrom higher employment, remittance in\ufb02ows from overseas workers, and \nlow in\ufb02ation. The unemployment rate fell from 6.6% in January\u00a02015 to \n5.8% in January 2016, and 752,000 new jobs were created in that\u00a0period. \nRemittances rose by 4.4% to $28.5 billion, equal to 9.8% of GDP. \nThe\u00a0increase was 5.8% in peso terms.\n\nGovernment expenditure, particularly on construction, accelerated \n\nduring the year, helped by improved budget execution. Growth in \ngovernment consumption quickened to 9.4%, and public construction \njumped by 20.6%. A 5.4% rise in private construction and higher \npurchases of machinery and commercial vehicles re\ufb02ected robust \nprivate \ufb01xed investment. Total \ufb01xed investment grew by 14.0%, more \nthan double the pace of 2014, and signi\ufb01cantly contributed to GDP \ngrowth. The ratio of \ufb01xed investment to GDP improved to 21.7%, \nthough at that pace it still lagged some other Southeast Asian economies \n(Figure\u00a03.28.2).\n\nNet exports exerted considerable drag on GDP growth as imports \n\nof goods and services rose much faster than exports in real terms. \nExports\u00a0of services, particularly business process outsourcing (BPO), \nremained buoyant, but goods exports were lackluster. \n\nBy sector, services growth accelerated to 6.7%, which contributed \n\nnearly two-thirds of total growth.

Domestic demand supported \nmanufacturing subsectors like food processing, chemicals, \ncommunication and transport equipment, and construction-related \nproducts. However, agricultural production was \ufb02at last year as \ntyphoons and drought damaged crops, particularly rice and maize. \n\nIn\ufb02ation eased to below 1.0% for several months and averaged a low \n1.4% in 2015 (Figure 3.28.3). Lower global oil and food prices dampened \nin\ufb02ation, and rice imports to augment domestic supplies also helped. \nThe central bank kept policy interest rates steady at 4% for overnight \nborrowing and 6% for overnight lending. Growth in broad money\u00a0(M3) \ndecelerated to 9.4% year on year in December 2015 from 11.2% a \nyear\u00a0earlier.\n\nWhile the government ramped up public expenditure excluding \ninterest by 15.7% in 2015, spending still fell short of the budget target. \nRevenue rose by 10.5% owing to higher tax income from tobacco and \nalcohol and more stringent tax enforcement. The budget de\ufb01cit widened \nfrom 0.6% of GDP in 2014 to 0.9% in 2015, well below the 2.0% de\ufb01cit \nceiling in the budget. Re\ufb02ecting a strengthening of the \ufb01scal position in \nrecent years, the ratio of government debt to GDP declined to 44.8% in \n2015, the lowest in over a decade (Figure 3.28.4). Foreign debt comprised \njust over one-third of the total.\n\nIn the external accounts, merchandise exports fell by 13.1% in US \ndollar terms, with declines in exports of manufactured goods, minerals, \nand fruit and vegetables. Merchandise imports declined by 3.2% in \nUS\u00a0dollars, largely from lower oil prices. Buoyant imports of capital and \nconsumer goods underlined the strength of private consumption and \ninvestment.\n\nThese developments widened the trade de\ufb01cit by 25.2% to \n\n$21.7\u00a0billion. Nevertheless, earnings from BPO and tourism, together \nwith remittances, generated a current account surplus of $8.4 billion, \nequal to 2.9% of GDP (Figure 3.28.5). The balance of payments, \ntempered by out\ufb02ows of portfolio investment, recorded a surplus of \n$2.6\u00a0billion. Gross international reserves totaled $81.9 billion as of \nFebruary 2016, cover for 10.2 months of imports of goods and services \nand income payments (Figure 3.28.6). The peso depreciated by 4.7% \nagainst the broadly strengthening US dollar in 2015.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth in domestic demand is expected to drive higher rates of \neconomic growth this year and next. Election-related spending \nwill support growth through May 2016 when national elections are \nscheduled. Net external demand will likely remain a drag on growth in \n2016, though less than in 2015, and add to growth in 2017. On balance, \nGDP is seen rising by 6.0% this year and 6.1% in 2017.\n\nThe acceleration in government spending in the second half of 2015 \n\nis projected to continue this year. The government has maintained its \nbudget de\ufb01cit ceiling at 2.0% of GDP in 2016, which accommodates \na larger de\ufb01cit than that realized in 2015. Budget allocations for \ninfrastructure are boosted to the equivalent of 5.0% of GDP, including \ninvestments in roads, agricultural infrastructure, and schools. \n\n%\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n-30\n\n3.28.3\u2002Inflation and policy rate\n\n \n\nOvernight borrowing\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (downloaded 14 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.28.4\u2002 National government debt \n\noutstanding\n\nForeign\nDomestic\n\n% of GDP\n\n2000\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\n2009\n\n2012\n\n2015\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (downloaded 14 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.28.5\u2002 Current account components\n\nIncome\nServices trade\nMerchandise trade\n\n$ billion\n\n% of GDP\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (downloaded 14 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f222\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nMoreover,\u00a0the government has accelerated the release of budget \nallocations and enhanced bidding and procurement processes to step up \nproject implementation. Spending is raised on social services including \nfunding for health, education, and conditional cash transfers to poor \nhouseholds. Civil service salaries are also raised this year. \n\nPrivate consumption will be the main growth driver again this \nyear. Rising employment, higher government salaries, modest in\ufb02ation, \nand remittance in\ufb02ows all point to robust consumer spending. \nConsumer\u00a0con\ufb01dence rose in the \ufb01rst quarter of 2016 (Figure 3.28.7). \nNevertheless, the pace of increase in private consumption could \nmoderate this year. Slower economic activity in the Middle East, where \nabout one-fourth of overseas Filipinos work, has dampened growth in \nremittances (Figure 3.28.8). Still, diversity in sources provides a cushion \nas remittances \ufb02ow from a broad range of countries (Figure 3.28.9). \n\nBuoyant imports of capital goods in 2015 and higher foreign direct \n\ninvestment in the past 2 years suggest that private investment will \nmaintain solid growth. Net in\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment totaled \n$5.7 billion in 2015, similar to the 2014 \ufb01gure but more than double the \nannual average from 2010 to 2013 (Figure 3.28.10). Growth in credit to \nbusiness picked up to 16.0% in January 2016. \n\nHowever, subdued global economic prospects indicate that \n\nmerchandise exports will decline slightly this year before turning up in \n2017. Exports fell by 3.9% year on year in January 2016, moderating from \ndouble-digit declines in most of 2015. The outlook for major markets \nJapan (receiving 21% of total merchandise exports in 2015) and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (11%) is lackluster, but Philippine exports \nto the European Union (12%) are bene\ufb01ting from expanded duty-free \naccess granted in 2014, and exports to the US (15%) are expected to \ngrow. Exports of services, mainly BPO, should perform well. Imports \nare projected to rise on growing consumption and investment, such that \nnet\u00a0external demand is seen weighing on GDP growth in 2016.\n\nAs in\ufb02ation is projected to be within the official target range of \n2%\u20134%, the central bank is expected to maintain an accommodative \nmonetary policy. In\ufb02ation is forecast to trend up this year to average \n2.3%, from 1.1% in the \ufb01rst 2 months (Figure 3.28.11). Drought from \nEl Ni\u00f1o will likely raise food prices and utility rates, while peso \ndepreciation and buoyant domestic demand will also contribute to \nin\ufb02ation. The government has imported rice and expanded irrigation to \nmitigate the impact of El Ni\u00f1o. Next year, in\ufb02ation is seen rising to 2.7%, \nassuming an upturn in global oil and commodity prices. \n\nOn the supply side, services such as transportation and \ncommunications are bene\ufb01tting from election-related spending. \nStrong\u00a0private consumption is driving growth in wholesale and retail \ntrade, and the outlook is favorable for BPO and tourism. BPO revenue \nrose from $18.9 billion in 2014 to $22.0 billion in 2015, according to \nan estimate by the BPO industry association, with employment at \n1.2 million. Tourism generated $5 billion in revenue from 5.4 million \ninternational tourists in 2015. The official target for 2016 is 6.0 million \ntourists.

The rate of underemployment also remains high at \n19.7%. In large part re\ufb02ecting the lack of good jobs, poverty remained \nelevated at 26.3% of the population in the \ufb01rst half of 2015, though \ndeclining from 28.8% in 2006.\n\nA survey found that college graduates took about a year to \ufb01nd \nwork, and high school graduates took up to 3 years. Many drift into \ninformal work, often part time and poorly paid, or remain unemployed. \nOne in\u00a0four young people is neither working nor pursuing education or \ntraining.\n\nThe Philippines has a relatively young population, as half of all \nFilipinos last year were younger than 25 years, and the median age was \nestimated at 23. This offers an opportunity to raise potential growth, \nbut the demographic dividend can be realized only if young people are \nemployed in productive jobs. \n\nA number of factors keep youth unemployment high. On the \ndemand-side, the number of jobs generated each year falls short of \nwhat is needed to both absorb new entrants into the labor force and \nthe 2.5 million unemployed, half of them young people. Almost 80% of \nnew jobs in the past 6 years have been generated by the service sector, \nparticularly BPO, tourism, and retail trade. Industry contributed about \n20% of the new jobs, while employment in agriculture fell in most years \n(Figure 3.28.13). Stronger employment generation will require more \nbroad-based growth driven by productivity gains across all sectors. \n\nand the needs of the labor market are a constraint. Improving the \nrelevance and quality of technical and vocational training programs \nand strengthening certi\ufb01cation frameworks will help overcome such \nmismatches. More programs are needed to provide employment \nservices, such as career guidance and coaching for young people when \nthey leave school. \n\nFollowing a successful pilot, the government is rolling out nationally \nthe JobStart Philippines program, which aims to provide a full range of \nemployment services to help students who have at least completed high \nschool become job ready and \ufb01nd decent employment. These services \ninclude life skills and technical training, career guidance, and on-the-job \ntraining or internship. Other measures cover improving the quality of \nlabor market databases to reduce job search costs and enable students \nand job seekers to make more informed decisions. \n\nThe effective implementation of these initiatives will require \n\nstrengthening the capacity of local government employment offices and \nboosting their budget resources. Improving policies on the national \napprenticeship program, temporary work agencies, and labor dispute \nresolution will also be needed to help young people gain longer-term \nand better paying jobs, rather than temporary ones.\n\n3.28.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n6.0\n\n2.3\n\n2.7\n\n6.1\n\n2.7\n\n2.8\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.28.12\u2002 Unemployment rates\n\nTotal\nYouth\n\n%\n\n \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nAgriculture\nManufacturing\n Other industry\nServices\n\nThousands\n\n1,200\n900\n600\n300\n\n0\n-300\n-600\n\n3.28.13\u2002 Change in employment by sector\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: Philippine Statistics Authority. www.psa.gov.ph\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nMismatches between the education and skills young people acquire \n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\nSource: Philippine Statistics Authority. www.psa.gov.ph\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fSingapore\n\nEconomic  growth  slowed  in  2015,  prices  declined,  and  the  current  account  improved.

The main driver of growth was \nservices, contributing 2.6 percentage points. Services expanded by \n3.5% on strong performances in wholesale and retail trade and in \n\ufb01nance and insurance. Sluggish private construction moderated \ngrowth in the sector to 2.5%, reducing its contribution to growth to \n0.1\u00a0percentage points. Manufacturing, the biggest sector, has contracted \nfor 5\u00a0consecutive quarters, pulling down GDP growth by 1.0 percentage \npoint\u00a0(Figure\u00a03.29.1). Manufacturing output fell by 5.2%, mainly because \nof a slowdown in rig building and weaker demand for oil and gas \nequipment. \n\nOn the demand side, total consumption expenditure grew by 4.9% \n\nto contribute 2.1 percentage points to growth, driven primarily by \nprivate\u00a0consumption expenditure on transport, goods and services, \nhousing, and utilities (Figure\u00a03.29.2). Exports of goods and services \ngrew by 2.5% and imports by 2.1%, both lower than in 2014. Net exports \ntherefore increased by 4.6%, contributing 1.3 percentage points to \ngrowth. However, investment declined by 6.2%\u2014largely from decreases \nin private construction, intellectual property products, and machinery \nand equipment\u2014to subtract 1.7 percentage points from growth. \n\nConsumer prices fell by 0.5% on average in 2015 as rents declined \nand transport costs dropped in line with lower oil prices (Figure\u00a03.29.3). \nCore\u00a0in\ufb02ation, which excludes accommodation and private road \ntransport, remained subdued at 0.5% year on year.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) continued to manage \nmonetary policy by adjusting the Singapore dollar\u2019s nominal effective \nexchange rate within an undisclosed trading band.

In nominal terms, the Singapore dollar \ndepreciated by 8.5% against the US dollar on average to reach its lowest \nvalue since 2010 (Figure 3.29.4). The 3-month Singapore interbank \noffered rate rose gradually from 0.5% in December 2014 to 1.2% in \nDecember 2015 and, following the hike in the US federal funds rate, \nto\u00a01.3% in February 2016 (Figure 3.29.5).\n\nMerchandise exports contracted in US dollar terms by 12.2% in \n2015 as exports of oil and goods other than electronics fell. Imports \ndeclined by 14.7% as oil imports shrank, widening the trade surplus \nto $78.7\u00a0billion. The current account surplus widened, to $57.6\u00a0billion, \nequal\u00a0to 19.7% of GDP, despite a de\ufb01cit in the services account. \nThe\u00a0overall balance of payments surplus narrowed to $1.1 billion, \nor 0.4% of GDP, owing to a rising de\ufb01cit in the capital and \ufb01nancial \naccounts (Figure\u00a03.29.6). \n\nThe budget for FY2015 (ending 31 March 2016) projected a primary \n\nde\ufb01cit of S$4.0 billion, or 1.0% of GDP, following an actual primary \nsurplus of 1.1% of GDP in FY2014, with expenditure rising by 19.3% \nand revenue by 4.8%. During the \ufb01rst 3 quarters of FY2015, revenue \nincreased by 5.9% and expenditure by 11.8%, including developmental \nexpenditure up by 19.6%. The budgetary outcome for FY2015 is therefore \nlikely to be a primary surplus. Revenues increased as the number of \ncerti\ufb01cates of entitlement for private car purchases grew and receipts \nrose from corporate and personal income tax, as well as from customs \nand excise taxes. Expenditures on social security and pensions were \nstrengthened, and incentives were offered for investing in innovation. \nOutlays for celebrating Singapore\u2019s 50 years of independence, the \nSoutheast Asia Games, and the ASEAN Para Games of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations also increased, but development expenditure in \nFY2015 is likely to be below the budgeted amount.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is forecast to remain stable at 2.0% in 2016 as expansion in \nservices outweighs weakness in manufacturing and construction, \nwhich will be held back by low external demand and higher borrowing \ncosts. The fall in the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index below \nthe 50\u00a0threshold in February 2016 indicates likely contraction in the \n\ufb01rst half of the year (Figure 3.29.7). Moreover, slower momentum in \nconstruction is expected as private construction contracts dropped in \n2015. In 2017, GDP growth is expected to improve to 2.2% as services \nremain resilient and manufacturing rebounds moderately. \n\nConsumption will drive growth in 2016 as the government \nincreases spending on social welfare, health infrastructure, public \ntransport, and the development of the Changi Airport and a planned \nhigh-speed rail link with Malaysia. Household spending will bene\ufb01t \nfrom lower in\ufb02ation and moderate wage increases but, given high \nhousehold debt, be\u00a0crimped by rising interest rates. Gross \ufb01xed \ninvestment will be weaker, as investment commitments reported by \nthe Economic\u00a0Development Board declined for most sectors in 2015 \n(Figure\u00a03.29.8).\n\n3.29.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20130.6\n\n18.8\n\n\u20022.2\n\n\u20020.4\n\n19.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.29.3\u2002 Inflation\n\nCore\nHeadline\nFood\n\n%, year on year\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 29 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.29.4\u2002Exchange rates\n\nNominal effective\nReal effective\n\nIndex, 2010 = 100\n\nNominal\n\nS$/$\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSources: Bureau of International Settlement; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 29 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.29.5\u2002Interest rates\n\nSingapore interbank offered rate\nUS federal funds rate\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n \n\n%\n\n1.6\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 29 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nSingapore\u2002\u2002227\n\nIn January 2016, exports fell by 15.1% year on year and imports by \n13.6%, pointing to continued weakness in external demand, including for \noil. As Singapore is one of the world\u2019s top re\ufb01ners of crude, low demand \nfor petroleum products will drag down export growth. The\u00a0trade \nbalance is nevertheless expected to be in surplus in 2016, as imports \nwill decline more than exports in US dollar terms, and net services \nwill improve, despite weaker exports of energy services, with rising \nnet exports of \ufb01nancial and tourism services. The current account \nsurplus will narrow to 18.8% of GDP and widen again to 19.5% in 2017 as \nexternal demand recovers. \n\nLower certi\ufb01cate of entitlement premiums, continuing declines in \nrents and property prices that began in 2014, and falling utility prices \nwill dampen prices in 2016 (Figure 3.29.9). The decline in consumer \nprices is projected to reach 0.6%, which is within the range of the \nforecast by the MAS. In\ufb02ation will return at 0.4% in 2017, assuming \noil\u00a0prices rise and food and social services costs continue to\u00a0increase. \nDespite de\ufb02ationary expectations for 2016, the MAS is expected \n\nto continue to manage the nominal effective exchange rate along \na moderately appreciating trend, but the nominal value of the \nSingapore\u00a0dollar, which fell to S$1.41 to the US dollar in February 2016, \nis expected to decline further in 2016. On the \ufb01scal front, the new \ngovernment is expected to continue a prudent \ufb01scal policy in view \nof the constitutional requirement that the budget be balanced over a \ngovernment\u2019s full term.\n\nDownside risks to the forecast stem from the uncertain global \neconomic outlook and domestic property price movements. Lower\u00a0oil \nprices and a sharper growth slowdown in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina could dampen export growth in 2016, and persistent weakness \nin the residential property market could choke investment growth. \nFurther\u00a0tightening of the labor market could, together with declining \nlabor productivity since 2014, pose another risk to growth projections.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014restraining household debt\nHousehold debt in Singapore rose from the equivalent of 65% of \nGDP in 2010 to 75% in 2015 (Figure 3.29.10). Tight macroprudential \npolicies implemented by the MAS in the past few years have effectively \ndampened domestic credit growth, but household debt in Singapore \nis still among the highest in the region, at more than\u00a0220% of \nhousehold disposable income in 2015. Twin reasons are the high rate \nof homeownership and high real estate prices. Mortgages account for \nmore than 74% of household debt and are the main avenue of rising \nhousehold debt (Figure 3.29.11). Low interest rates on mortgages \nand long\u00a0maturities fueled a rapid rise in property loans, with a \ncorresponding increase in locally incorporated banks\u2019 exposure to the \nproperty sector. Property-related lending accounts for 28% of banking \nsystem loans, and many other loans are collateralized with property. \n\nSoaring household debt may not pose an immediate risk to economic \n\nactivity or bank soundness, but it sows vulnerability. Borrowers may \ndefault if domestic income growth falters or, as 70% of mortgages \nhave \ufb02oating rates, global interest rates rise abruptly.

According to the MAS, the number of \nborrowers who had missed payments on unsecured credit for 2 or \nmore months rose by 6% in September 2015, bringing the increase \nover the previous 12 months to 18%. Systemic risk could intensify, \nas higher borrowing costs are likely to dampen the housing market \nand construction, slowing domestic growth already weakened by a \nchallenging external environment. This could further crimp consumer \nspending and hurt household \ufb01nances. Housing price corrections also \npose risks, and prices have fallen by more than 8% over the past 2 years \nfollowing the 2013 introduction by the MAS of tighter macroprudential \npolicies, including a\u00a070% limit on the ratio of loan to value for new loans. \nContinuing moderation in residential property prices has tempered \n\ngrowth in household wealth and spending. A sharp correction\u00a0would \nlikely hamper economic growth further, as real estate activity \ncontributes substantial employment and value added. A buildup of \nmacroeconomic risks and vulnerability could pose a systemic risk to \nthe \ufb01nancial sector. Property foreclosures and personal bankruptcies \ncould amplify pressures on bank balance sheets and impair the health of \n\ufb01nancial institutions and broader \ufb01nancial stability.\n\nRisk stemming from a correction in property prices and payment \ndefaults appear to be manageable because the banking system is strong. \nNonperforming housing loans are currently only 0.4% of the loan \nportfolio and are adequately provisioned. Further, banks meet their \nminimum regulatory capital adequacy ratio of 10%, and the overall loan-\nto-value ratio was less than 50% in 2014, with just 5% of outstanding \nhousing loans showing a ratio of above 80%. A\u00a0\ufb01nancial stability review \nin 2015 therefore stated that only a huge fall in real estate prices could \npose widespread debt-servicing problems. However,\u00a0the adequacy of \nthe existing substantial buffer against mortgage risk depends on how \nrapidly loan rates increase, house prices falter, or economic growth \nslackens. Policy makers should be vigilant of mounting vulnerability \nbecause domestic banks are exposed to the property sector to the tune \nof at least 46% of their loan portfolio. Continuous monitoring of bank \nactivities and risks are essential to detect bank fragility, and preemptive \nmacroprudential policies are needed to avert \ufb01nancial instability.\n\n3.29.9\u2002 Property price index\n\nLanded property\nOther property\n\n%, year on year\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ3\n2013\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ3\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ3\n2015\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.29.10\u2002 Household debt\n\n \n% of GDP\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: Singapore Statistics (accessed 29 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.29.11\u2002 Household balance sheet\n\nLiquid \ufb01nancial assets\nResidential property assets\nOther \ufb01nancial assets\nPersonal loans\nMortgage loans\nNet worth\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Singapore Statistics (accessed 29 February 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n\u221210\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\n%  of GDP\n\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n\u2013100\n\n\fThailand\n\nGovernment  spending  revived  economic  growth  in  2015,  while  private  sector  activity  and  exports \nlagged. Growth is seen picking up this year and next if planned infrastructure investment proceeds \nas  scheduled.  Lower  farm  incomes  from  drought  and  weak  agricultural  prices  are  weighing  on \nprivate  consumption.  Consumer  prices,  having  declined  last  year,  are  forecast  to  nudge  up. \nFalling\u00a0imports are leaving sizable trade and current account surpluses while exports remain weak.\n\nEconomic performance \nHigher government spending, particularly on capital works, drove \neconomic growth in 2015, assisted by a modest pickup in private \nconsumption. GDP rose by 2.8%, compared with just 0.8% in 2014, \nwhen political unrest and a military coup disrupted the economy \n(Figure\u00a03.30.1).\n\nPublic \ufb01xed investment rebounded by 29.8% from contraction in \n2014 as the government accelerated budget disbursements for water-\nmanagement, road, and community projects (Figure 3.30.2). State-\nowned enterprises also boosted spending on construction projects after \npublic investment slumped in 2014 because of political disruptions and \nlegal challenges. Government consumption spending rose by 2.2% in \n2015, a pace similar to that of the 2 previous years.\n\nIn contrast with the rebound in public sector investment, \ufb01xed \ninvestment by the private sector fell by 2.0% in 2015 owing to lackluster \nprospects for exports, subdued private sector demand, and slack \nindustrial capacity. The end of the year brought signs of improved \nprivate investment, mainly in buildings. \n\n2.1% last year. A major reason for tepid spending was contraction \nin agriculture caused by drought and low commodity prices, which \ncut farm incomes by 11.0% and reduced total employment by 0.2%. \nAnother\u00a0dampening factor was high household debt, equal to 81% of \nGDP. Consumer con\ufb01dence sagged through the \ufb01rst 3 quarters before \nturning up at the end of 2015. The government launched two stimulus \npackages in the second half of 2015 to spur consumption.

Much of the growth in services stemmed from a 20.4% leap in \ntourist arrivals, a recovery from 2014 when street protests and military \nintervention hurt tourism (Figure 3.30.3). In particular, arrivals from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) jumped last year. Solid expansion was \nrecorded in tourism-related services including hotels, restaurants, and \nretail trade, as well as in \ufb01nance and transport and communications.\n\nConstruction rebounded by 15.8% in 2015 as the government ramped \n\nup spending on capital works. Weak domestic and external demand \nheld manufacturing growth to only 0.9%, which still improved on 2014. \nCar manufacturing and food processing performed relatively well, and \nelectronics started to improve. Industry as a whole recorded growth \nat\u00a02.2%.\n\nAgriculture including \ufb01sheries had a particularly bad year, the \nsector shrinking by 4.2% because of drought and low prices for farm \ncommodities. Rice and palm oil production fell, but shrimp culture \nrecovered after a fall in 2014. Thailand\u2019s capture \ufb01shing industry was \ndisrupted by a crackdown on foreign boats working Indonesian\u00a0waters \nand by the threat of a ban on seafood exports to the important \nEuropean\u00a0Union market unless it tackled illegal, unreported, and \nunregulated \ufb01shing. \n\nEconomic growth did get support from \ufb01scal and monetary policies. \n\nThe government improved its budget disbursement rate to 94% in \nFY2015 (ended 30 September 2015) from 89% in FY2014, though still \nshort of the 97% target. The \ufb01scal outcome was a de\ufb01cit equal to 2.5% \nof GDP. The central bank, confronted with an unexpectedly sluggish \neconomy and declining consumer prices, lowered its policy rate in \nMarch 2015, and again in April, to 1.5%. Commercial banks reduced \nlending rates, and growth in credit to the private sector from deposit-\ntaking institutions picked up to increase by 5.6%. Lending to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) jumped in the last quarter when the \ngovernment offered them low-interest loans and loan guarantees. \n\nThe consumer price index slipped by 0.9% in 2015 on lower prices \nfor fuel and food, along with lackluster domestic demand (Figure 3.30.4). \nCore in\ufb02ation remained positive, this measure of consumer prices that \nexcludes fresh food and energy rising by 1.1%. \n\nThailand recorded large trade and current account surpluses, \nlargely because imports slumped. Merchandise exports and imports \nhave declined in US dollar terms for 3 consecutive years (Figure 3.30.5). \nIn 2015, merchandise exports fell by 5.6% to $212.1 billion, with steep \nfalls in agricultural and \ufb01shery products, as well as in oil and chemical \nproducts, but higher shipments of passenger cars. Exports declined to \nthe PRC, Japan, and the larger economies in Southeast Asia but rose \nto the group of neighboring countries: Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. \n\nMerchandise imports dived by 11.3% to $177.5 billion, re\ufb02ecting slack \n\ndomestic demand and lower prices for imported oil and commodities. \nAs a result, the trade surplus jumped by 40.7% to $34.6 billion. \nTrade\u00a0in services was also in surplus, by $9.9 billion, contributing to \n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n%\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n3.30.3\u2002Tourism Indicators\n\nNumber of tourists\n\nGrowth in tourist numbers\n\nMillion visitors\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th  \n(accessed 11 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.30.4\u2002Inflation and policy interest rate\n\nPolicy rate\nOverall\nCore\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSources: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th; CEIC Data \nCompany (both accessed 11 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.30.5\u2002Trade indicators\n\nTrade balance\n\n$ billion\n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th  \n(accessed 8 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand\u2002\u2002231\n\na large current account surplus of $34.8 billion, equal to 8.8% of\u00a0GDP. \nBy\u00a0contrast, capital and \ufb01nancial accounts registered a de\ufb01cit of \n$19.0\u00a0billion, mainly from out\ufb02ows of portfolio investment and Thai \nforeign investment abroad. Outward foreign direct investment doubled in \n2015 from 2014, as foreign direct investment into Thailand rose by 29%. \nGross international reserves were, at $156.5 billion, little changed \n\nfrom 2014, covering 8.2 months of imports of goods and services, \nand standing at 2.9 times short-term external debt. The Thai baht \ndepreciated by 8.6% against the broadly strengthening US dollar in 2015.\nEconomic reform in 2015 encompassed state-owned enterprises, \n\nspecial economic zones, and fuel subsidies. The government is \nforming a holding company to supervise state \ufb01rms and improve their \nperformance. The State Enterprise Supervisory Board ordered state \nenterprises to withdraw investment from 44 subsidiaries with business \nin areas unrelated to the parent \ufb01rm. New special economic zones along \nborders with neighboring countries are being prepared. Lower global oil \nprices facilitated a phasing out of subsidies on diesel, cooking gas, and \nnatural gas for vehicles. \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast to rise over the next 2 years, assuming that \nsubstantial public infrastructure investments proceed on schedule and \nthe political climate is calm around national elections proposed for the \nsecond half of 2017. On these bases, GDP is projected to edge up to 3.0% \nthis year and accelerate to 3.5% in 2017 (Figure 3.30.6).\n\nInvestment will pick up in 2016 under the government\u2019s Transport \nInfrastructure Master Plan, which runs through 2022. Implementation \nof 20 projects costing $51 billion will make headway in 2016. These \nprojects include motorways, railways, mass transit rail lines, seaports, \nand expansion of Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok. \nThe\u00a0Ministry of Finance projects that almost $2 billion will be disbursed \nfor these projects in FY2016. Thailand is also negotiating with the PRC \nto build two railway lines, but the timing of construction is uncertain. \nThe FY2016 budget increases public expenditure by 7.8% from \nthe previous year\u2019s budget. The government has added B56 billion to \nthe original FY2016 budget, with additional revenue sourced partly \nby auctioning 4G spectra for mobile phone services. Almost 39% of \nexpenditure under the original budget was disbursed in the \ufb01rst 4 \nmonths of FY2016, ahead of target. The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is expected to \nwiden to the equivalent of 3.0% of GDP in FY2016.\n\nGood progress on the major investment projects would lift business \ncon\ufb01dence and private investment. The private sector can participate in \ninfrastructure projects through fast-tracked public\u2013private partnerships \nthat so far include mass rapid transit lines, motorways, and a renewable \nenergy power plant. The government\u2019s nascent Thailand Future Fund is \nanother channel for equity investment in infrastructure. \n\nFollowing up on stimulus rolled out last year for rural areas, \nconsumers, and SMEs, the government declared 2016 to be a special \ninvestment-promotion year supported by a raft of tax breaks intended \nto revive private investment.

SMEs pay a lower income tax rate \nfor 2 years, and additional tax concessions are available for capital \ninvestment and for investments in special economic zones and in \nresearch and development. Investment in 10 industries targeted as new \ngrowth engines is exempt from corporate income tax for up to 15 years. \nThe\u00a0industries include biofuels, biotechnology, logistics, and robotics. \nPrivate consumption is expected to increase at a modest pace in \n\n2016 but then quicken next year. The stimulus measures will help, \nbut consumption remains suppressed by household \ufb01nances battered \nby drought, low prices for agricultural products, and already high \nhousehold debt. Lower rice production curtailed by drought is unlikely \nto push up rice prices much because large stockpiles overhang the \nmarket. Rubber and palm oil face soft global demand and large \ninventories. Still, rural incomes are getting some support from \ngovernment subsidies on both production costs and crop insurance, soft \nloans, and the funding for village projects. Planned tax restructuring \nin 2017 is expected to provide personal income tax relief, which should \nprod consumption. \n\nEconomic data for January 2016 indicate a lackluster start to this \n\nyear (Figure 3.30.7). Private consumption decelerated in January, \nparticularly for durable goods, as tax rebates for spending in 2015 \nexpired and the excise tax on cars rose at the start of this year. \nPrivate\u00a0investment and manufacturing continued to languish in January. \nBusiness sentiment for the near term declined, but most respondents to \na Bank of Thailand survey in February expected business conditions to \nimprove in the months ahead (Figure 3.30.8). \n\nThe consumer price index fell by 0.5% year on year in the \ufb01rst 2 \n\nmonths of 2016. Nevertheless, prices are projected to nudge higher \nduring the year from the low base set in 2015. Baht depreciation puts \nsome upward pressure on import prices while supporting economic \ngrowth. In\ufb02ation is forecast to average 0.6% in 2016, picking up to 2.0% \nin 2017 as domestic demand \ufb01rms and oil prices turn up (Figure 3.30.9). \nLow in\ufb02ation suggests that the Bank of Thailand will maintain an \naccommodative monetary stance.\n\nExternal trade started 2016 on a weak note. Merchandise exports \ncontracted in value terms in January and are projected to post a small \ndecline this year before turning up in 2017. Tourist arrivals remained \na bright spot in January, rising by 15%, with further gains expected. \nMerchandise imports slumped on lower oil prices and weak demand for \nraw materials and intermediate goods. Imports are seen rising slightly \nthis year and accelerating in 2017 as investment gathers momentum. \nAnother large current account surplus is forecast for this year before it \nsubsides in 2017 (Figure 3.30.10). \n\nRisks to the outlook come from a possible worsening of the drought, \nwhich would hit incomes, private consumption, and exports. The timely \nimplementation of government investment projects is crucial. Delays \nwould reduce public investment and damage consumer and business \ncon\ufb01dence alike. External risks stem from slower-than-anticipated \ngrowth in major trading partners and volatile global capital \ufb02ows. Sizable \ncurrent account surpluses, relatively low external debt, and substantial \ninternational reserves mitigate downside risks (Figure 3.30.11).\n\nIndex\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n3.30.8\u2002 Consumer confidence and \nbusiness\u00a0sentiment indexes\n\nConsumer con\ufb01dence: next 3 months\nBusiness sentiment: next 3 months\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nFeb\n2016\n\nNote: A reading of less than 50 denotes a deterioration \nin business sentiment; a reading of less than 100 denotes \ndeterioration in consumer con\ufb01dence.\nSources: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th \n(accessed\u00a011 March 2016); CEIC Data Company.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.30.9\u2002Inflation\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.30.10\u2002Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n \n10\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand\u2002\u2002233\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014supporting growth \nin\u00a0smaller\u00a0businesses\nSMEs comprise 99% of Thailand\u2019s businesses but generate less than \n40% of GDP (Figure 3.30.12). A study last year found that poor\u00a0access \nto \ufb01nance keeps SMEs from making a bigger contribution to \neconomic\u00a0growth. \n\nThe state-owned Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nBank of Thailand and the Thailand Credit Guarantee Corporation \nhelp to fund SMEs, but government resources alone are insufficient. \nCommercial banks are wary about lending to SMEs out of concern that \ntheir accounts are unreliable and they lack collateral for loans. \n\nThe government has started a program to encourage SMEs to \nkeep a single set of \ufb01nancial statements to improve their chances of \naccessing bank \ufb01nance. Under the program, past accounts of eligible \nbusinesses with revenue of less than B500 million in 2016 are exempt \nfrom audits by tax officials. Eligible businesses with revenue of up to \nB30\u00a0million and paid-up capital of up to B5 million get tax breaks for \n2\u00a0accounting\u00a0years.\n\nTo address inadequate collateral, the new Business Security Act \nallows businesses to use as collateral for borrowing from banks assets \nother than land, such as inventories and trademarks. \n\nIn\u00a0response, the government is offering new businesses exemption from \ncorporate income tax for 5 years through 2020, and it wants state-\nowned banks to set up venture capital funds. It will be important that \nsuch funds focus on entrepreneurial and technologically innovative \n\ufb01rms that will eventually be able to compete in international markets. \nThe\u00a0government is also looking to remove legal and regulatory obstacles \nto the development of new businesses, including through better \nenforcement of competition law. \n\nAnother constraint on SMEs is their lack of capacity and resources \n\nfor research and development or to penetrate overseas markets. \nThe\u00a0government could help by investing in infrastructure and facilities \nthat foster research and development. Thailand invested only 0.25% of \nGDP on research and development in 2011, comparing unfavorably with \n1.1% in Malaysia, 2.0% in the PRC, and 4.0% in the Republic of Korea. \nOn the issue of access to overseas markets, the Ministry of Commerce \nwill support and arrange business introductions for SMEs that join \ninternational trade shows.\n\n195\n\n180\n\n165\n\n150\n\n135\n\n120\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n3.30.11\u2002Gross international reserves\n\nGross international reserves Months of imports\n\n$ billion\n\nMonths of imports\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th  \n(accessed 11 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\nSource: The Office of SMEs Promotion.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nStart-ups can \ufb01nd it especially challenging to raise funds. \n\n3.30.12\u2002 Output of small and medium-sized \n\nenterprises\n\n% share of GDP\n\n\fViet Nam\n\nVigorous  expansion  of  manufacturing  and  construction  in  2015  spurred  the  fastest  economic \ngrowth in 7 years. Foreign direct investment is seen supporting strong growth through the forecast \nperiod.  Inflation  will  revive  but  remain  relatively  modest.  The  current  account  is  forecast  to  slide \ninto a small deficit. Reforms to banks and state enterprises continue to make gradual progress, but \nan  emerging  need  is  better  management  of  rapid  urbanization.\n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic growth accelerated to 6.7% in 2015, the fastest clip since 2008. \nIndustry expanded by 9.6% and contributed nearly half of total growth \n(Figure 3.31.1). Powered by high foreign direct investment (FDI), the \nmanufacturing subsector rose by a rapid 10.6%, and construction grew \nby 10.8% on foreign investment in factories, a recovery in the property \nmarket, and higher spending on infrastructure. FDI\u00a0disbursements, \nwhich have increased substantially over the past decade, swelled by 17% \nto $14.5 billion in 2015 (Figure 3.31.2). \n\nGrowth in services was maintained at 6.3% last year. Wholesale and \n\nretail trade grew by 9.1% on strong private consumption, and banking \nand \ufb01nance expanded by 7.4% as growth in credit quickened. However, \na 0.2% decline in tourist arrivals dampened growth in tourism-related \nservices. Agriculture recorded lower growth at 2.4% as global food \nprices fell and El Ni\u00f1o brought drought. \n\nBy expenditure, private consumption accelerated to 9.3%, spurred \nby rising employment and incomes and lower in\ufb02ation. Investment also \nstrengthened as buoyant FDI in\ufb02ows and expansion in credit supported \na 9.0% rise in gross capital formation. Net external demand weighed on \nGDP growth, though, as imports of goods and services in real terms rose \nfaster than exports.\n\nNotwithstanding stronger domestic demand, in\ufb02ation slowed to \naverage just 0.6% last year, the lowest since 2001, mainly on lower food \nand fuel prices (Figure 3.31.3). The State Bank of Viet Nam, the central \nbank, kept policy interest rates steady in 2015 after reducing them over \nrecent years, but commercial banks trimmed lending rates by 0.2\u20130.5 \npercentage points on average. Lending rates have dropped by half since \n2011. Lower rates for borrowers complemented recovering consumer \nand investor con\ufb01dence to spur credit growth to an estimated 18%, \nexceeding the government\u2019s initial target of 13%\u201315%. Broad money \nsupply increased by an estimated 14% (Figure 3.31.4).\n\nThis chapter was written by Aaron Batten, Chu Hong Minh, and Nguyen Luu Thuc \nPhuong of the Viet Nam Resident Mission, ADB, Ha Noi.

The central bank also moved to enhance exchange rate \n\ufb02exibility by expanding the trading band from 1% to 3% on either side of \nthe reference rate and changing to a daily reference rate announcement \nsystem. The monetary authority tightened regulations on foreign \ncurrency and discouraged foreign currency hoarding by mandating zero \ninterest rates for US dollar deposits. Over 2015, the dong depreciated by \n5% against the US dollar (Figure 3.31.5). \n\nAfter several years of large external surpluses, the current account \n\ncame under pressure in 2015 as imports rose faster than exports. \nMerchandise imports rose on a balance-of-payments basis by an estimated \n12% to $155 billion. Imports of machinery, equipment, and electronic \ncomponents surged by more than 25%, re\ufb02ecting strong demand for \ncapital goods and inputs into export-orientated manufacturing. Imports of \nconsumption goods rose by 10%, lifted by buoyant consumer spending. \n\nMerchandise exports increased by an estimated 7.9% to $162 billion. \n\nCustoms data show that the biggest gains were in exports of mobile \nphones and their components, which jumped by 30% and comprised 19% \nof total exports. Viet Nam\u2019s imports and exports together now exceed \n165% of GDP, compared with less than 70% when the government \nstarted economic reforms in the mid-1990s. \n\nThe result was a 39% fall in the trade surplus, which, along with an \nestimated 17% decline in remittances, cut the current account surplus to \nan estimated 0.3% of GDP from 4.9% in 2014. After taking into account \na smaller surplus in the capital account and sizable negative net errors \nand omissions, the overall balance of payments recorded a de\ufb01cit equal \nto 3.1% of GDP (Figure 3.31.6). Foreign exchange reserves fell to an \nestimated 2 months of import cover (Figure 3.31.7). \n\nEfforts to rein in the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit had limited impact last year. \nThe government reported that the budget de\ufb01cit equaled 5.4% of GDP, \nnarrowing slightly from 5.7% in 2014. Revenue rose by 10.0% and would \nhave increased faster if not for lower oil prices and a cut in the corporate \nincome tax rate. Government expenditure grew by 7.3%. Public debt, \nincluding debt guaranteed by the government, was projected to equal \na record 62% of GDP, approaching a 65% limit set by the National \nAssembly (Figure 3.31.8). \n\nProgress on economic reform remains slow. The government sold \nminority equity stakes in some 160 state-owned enterprises in 2015, well \nbelow its target of 289. Many individual equitizations fell short of\u00a0targets. \nAs for banking reforms, the central bank supported the mergers \n\nof several banks, following through on its plan for banking sector \nconsolidation. Reported nonperforming loans (NPLs) declined to 2.7% of \noutstanding loans by the end of 2015, largely through their transfer from \nbanks to the Viet Nam Asset Management Company. This company, \nestablished by the government in 2013 to acquire, restructure, and sell \nNPLs, had acquired $11.0 billion in bad loans by the end of 2015, up from \n$6.1 billion a year earlier. But with a limited capital base and lacking an \nadequate legal framework for resolving NPLs, it had sold or recovered \nby the end of December last year just 9% of the NPLs it held. \n\n3.31.3\u2002Inflation\n\nOverall\nCore\n\n%, year on year\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nNote: Core excludes food in\ufb02ation.\nSource: General Statistics Office of Viet Nam.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.31.4\u2002Credit and money supply growth\n\nCredit to the economy\nMoney supply\n\n% change, year on year\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSources: State Bank of Viet Nam; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.31.5\u2002Exchange rate\n\nReference rate of the State Bank of Viet Nam\nUpper bound of the trading band\nLower bound of the trading band\nBlack market exchange rate\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nD\u2019000/$\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSources: State Bank of Viet Nam; ADB observations.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f236\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nEconomic prospects \nThe economy is projected to sustain growth at 6.7% in 2016 before the \npace moderates to 6.5% in 2017 (Figure 3.31.9). Strong export-orientated \nmanufacturing, FDI in\ufb02ows, and domestic demand will be partly offset \nby the effect of slowing expansion in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC). New FDI commitments came in relatively \ufb02at at $22.8 billion in \n2015, which suggests that disbursements of FDI could level out this year \nand decline in 2017. About 60% of the FDI commitments are for export-\norientated manufacturing. \n\nRising incomes and modest (though quickening) in\ufb02ation are \n\nexpected to buoy private consumption. Sharply rising sales of \nautomobiles\u2014up by 55% in 2015\u2014illustrate the recovery in consumer \ncon\ufb01dence. Viet Nam has become the fastest-growing auto market in \nSoutheast Asia. Business sentiment is similarly buoyant. A survey in \nDecember 2015 showed that 41% of businesses expected conditions to \nimprove in 2016, and a further 40% expected stable conditions. \n\nProspects for growth in private investment are enhanced by a \nproliferation of trade and investment agreements concluded over the \npast 18 months. These include trade agreements with the European \nUnion and the Republic of Korea, and commitments to participate in \nboth the Trans-Paci\ufb01c Partnership led by the US and the Eurasian \nEconomic Union led by the Russian Federation. Viet Nam is expected to \nbene\ufb01t as well from the ASEAN Economic Community, whose members \nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations collectively form Viet \nNam\u2019s third-largest export market after the US and the European Union.\n\nThese agreements will be implemented over several years but \nare expected to stimulate investment in the near term as businesses \nprepare for expanded trade opportunities. The agreements also signal \nto the business community the government\u2019s renewed commitment \nto liberalize the economy. In recent years, it has eased restrictions on \nforeign ownership of property and corporate shares and has said it \nwould reduce from 51 to 6 the number of industries closed to foreign \nownership. The VN Index of share prices rose by 6.1% in 2015, building \non a 8.1% gain in 2014. \n\nManufacturing and construction are projected to maintain solid \n\nexpansion. The purchasing managers\u2019 index showed in the \ufb01rst 2 \nmonths of 2016 improving business conditions for manufacturers, \nincluding a rise in new orders (Figure 3.31.10). Services are projected \nto expand at a robust pace, though prospects have dimmed for tourism \nfrom the PRC, the source of one-quarter of Viet Nam\u2019s inbound tourists. \nVisitor arrivals from the PRC fell by 8.5% in 2015. Subdued growth will \ncontinue for agriculture in the near term under soft global food prices \nand the effects of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nIn\ufb02ation picked up to average 1.3% in the \ufb01rst 3 months of 2016 and \n\nis forecast to average 3.0% this year and 4.0% in 2017 (Figure 3.31.11). \nThe government is expected to raise administered prices for education \nand health care and boost public sector minimum wages. Import prices \nwill rise this year with dong depreciation, and higher global food and \nfuel prices in 2017 will add to in\ufb02ation next year. \n\nThe central bank targets credit growth at 18%\u201320% in 2016 to \naccommodate strong economic growth.

The government aims to narrow the budget de\ufb01cit to 4.9% \nof GDP in 2016 and 4.0% in 2017. Continuing a shift started in 2015, \nthe\u00a0budget for 2016 puts greater emphasis on capital expenditure, which \nis slated to rise by 25.5%. Current expenditure is set to rise by a more \nmodest 6.5%. \n\nPlans for \ufb01scal consolidation are at risk, however, from shortfalls in \nrevenue. Over the past 5 years, reductions in corporate income tax rates, \nthe removal of tariffs, and tax exemptions for favored \ufb01rms have eroded \nthe tax base. Low oil prices are dragging on resource tax revenue, \nwhich comprises 10% of the total. Central government revenue and \ngrants fell from the equivalent of 27.6% of GDP in 2010 to 22.0% in 2015. \nThe government could use funds from the equitization of state-owned \nenterprises and issue more short-term securities to support the budget \nin the near term, but achieving a more sustainable \ufb01scal position is likely \nto require tax reform to reverse falls in the ratio of tax to GDP. \n\nMerchandise exports are seen rising by 10% in US dollar terms \nthis year and by 14% in 2017 as new production from foreign-invested \nfactories comes online and trade agreements take effect. Imports \nwill also continue to grow in response to strong demand for both \nconsumption and capital goods, and to supply inputs for manufacturing. \nModest recovery is expected in remittances. The current account is \nforecast to slip into de\ufb01cit this year and recover to balance in 2017 \n(Figure 3.31.12). \n\nSluggish progress on reforming banks and state-owned enterprises \n\nposes risks to the outlook. Undercapitalized banks with de\ufb01cient \n\ufb01nancial transparency remain exposed to shocks. The upswing in credit \ngrowth could spark a new round of speculation in risky real estate. \nTo mitigate such risks, the central bank took steps early in 2016 to \ntighten lending requirements for real estate and reduce the potential \nfor maturity mismatch in bank lending. Further progress on bank \nconsolidation and enhanced transparency, asset classi\ufb01cation, NPL \nresolution, and disclosure requirements will be vital for strengthening \nthe sector. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014managing rapid urbanization\nUrbanization has been relatively recent in Viet Nam. Until the 1980s, \nthe government\u2019s focus on agriculture encouraged workers to stay in \nrural areas, and as late as 1990 only 20% of the population lived in cities \n(Figure 3.31.13). Deeper economic reform and less-constrained rural\u2013\nurban migration from the mid-1990s triggered rapid growth in cities, \nwhich developed as centers for services and manufacturing. Over the \npast 2 decades, the number of urban dwellers has jumped to 31 million, \nor 34% of the population, and is projected to reach 46 million, or 44%, \nby 2030. \n\nGrowth in urban centers and formal employment are important \ndrivers of the economy, as illustrated by estimates that show at least \n\n3.31.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n\u20026.7\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20130.2\n\n6.5\n\n4.0\n\n0.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.31.9\u2002GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nIndex\n\n56\n54\n52\n50\n48\n46\n44\n\n%\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.31.10\u2002Purchasing managers\u2019 index\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nNote: Nikkei, Markit.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 1 March 2016). \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.31.11\u2002Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f238\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\n70% of GDP is now generated in cities. However, urban transportation \nnetworks, water and sanitation systems, health and education services, \nand other physical and social infrastructure have struggled to keep pace. \nMoreover, rapidly rising urban populations strain natural resources and \npollute the environment. To remain a vibrant industrializing economy, \nViet Nam will need to develop more efficient urban centers that can \nsupport much larger populations. Achieving this will require progress \non three fronts. \n\nThe \ufb01rst is urban planning. The current planning law stresses \ndecentralized urban planning and stakeholder consultation, which \nrequires more urban planning and management capacity in provincial \nand local governments. Too often, masterplans are idealized visions of \nfuture cities that do not take into account the real needs of households, \nbusinesses, or local governments.\n\nSecond is the funding of urban infrastructure. Outside of Ha Noi and \n\nHo Chi Minh City, few urban governments can raise enough revenue \nfor infrastructure on their own, leaving many heavily dependent on \nthe central government annual budget. This inhibits infrastructure \ndevelopment because local governments need multiyear funding \ncommitments to complete projects such as upgrades to citywide \ndrainage systems. Funding can be even more difficult for critical \nprojects that generate little revenue, such as sewerage, which typically \nrequire signi\ufb01cant official development assistance from abroad. \n\nFor lack of own-source funding, urban authorities sometimes rely \n\non private developers to provide infrastructure through land-for-\ndevelopment deals. Such deals can undervalue public land and build \nlow-quality infrastructure. Further, a model of urban development \ndriven by developers can distort supply by, for example, overinvesting \nin higher-end housing and underinvesting in homes for the urban poor. \nThese issues can be addressed by strengthening provincial planning, \ncreating medium-term frameworks for funding urban services, and \nencouraging provincial governments to deemphasize their role as \ninvestors and focus more on planning and regulating urban services, \nland use, and the stewardship of natural resources. \n\nFinally, urban development needs to take the environment into \naccount. Land-for-development deals often create urban sprawl and \nbuild inappropriately in high-risk areas, including \ufb02oodplains. Moreover, \nthe present planning system does not encourage governments to \neffectively incorporate climate change into urban plans. As a result, \ncities often focus on expansion and give inadequate attention to climate \nand disaster risks. \n\n3.31.12\u2002Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.31.13\u2002Urban population\n\nUrban population\nPopulation in cities of more than 1 million\n\n% of total population\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n1960 70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n95 2000 05\n\n10\n\n15\n\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online \ndatabase (accessed 9 March 2016). \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fThE PACIFIC\n\nFIJI\nPAPUA NEw gUINEA\nSOLOMON ISLANDS\nTIMOr-LESTE\nVANUATU\nNOrTh PACIFIC ECONOMIES\nSOUTh PACIFIC ECONOMIES\nSMALL ISLAND ECONOMIES\n\n\f\fFiji\n\nRecent  strong  growth  driven  by  a  favorable  domestic  environment  and  rising  investor  confidence \nsuffered  a  setback  in  February  2016  when  a  category  5  cyclone  struck.  Early  assessment  shows \nagriculture,  especially  sugar,  was  hard  hit.  Tourism  faces  headwinds  from  cancellations  as  high \nas\u00a0 25%  immediately  following  the  cyclone.  Damage  and  losses  initially  estimated  to  exceed \n$500\u00a0 million,  equal  to  roughly  11%  of  GDP,  are  likely  to  constrain  growth  in  2016. \n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic growth moderated to 4.0% in 2015 from 5.3% a year earlier \nas agricultural activity in sugar, \ufb01sheries, and timber slowed under \na strong El Ni\u00f1o weather system that affected the country for most \nof the year (Figure 3.32.1). Tourism, which is Fiji\u2019s main earner of \nforeign currency, exceeded expectations with arrivals growing by 9.0% \n(Figure\u00a03.32.2). While this likely re\ufb02ected displacement of some tourists \nfrom Vanuatu following Cyclone Pam in early 2015, it was noteworthy \nthat Fiji attracted larger numbers of visitors from Asia. Arrivals from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China were up by 41% during the year. Fiji Airways \nis actively targeting Asian markets with \ufb02ights to the Republic\u00a0of\u00a0Korea \nand Hong Kong, China. The airline plans to start a new route to \nSingapore in April following the delivery of a new A330-300 aircraft in \nDecember 2015. \n\nGrowth in personal remittances at 28.3% and improved labor market \n\nconditions also helped to drive recent growth. Consumption spending \nremained strong as evidenced by a 12.4% increase in value-added tax \n(VAT) collections over the previous year and a 2.3% increase in domestic \ncredit. Lending for investment surged by 77.7% in 2015, driven by strong \ngrowth in construction. Total investment equaled 29% of GDP in 2015 \nand has now surpassed the government target of 25% for 3 years in a \nrow. Investment shows little sign of abating in the near term. \n\nFiscal policy remained expansionary and focused on road, water-\nsupply, and sanitation infrastructure and human capital development \npursued mainly by providing free primary and secondary education. \nDespite spending increases, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit declined from the equivalent \nof 4.1% of GDP in 2014 to 2.5% in 2015 following sales of state assets \n(Figure 3.32.3).\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Fiji maintained an accommodative monetary \n\npolicy during 2015 to support domestic private sector investment \nand consumption. Interest rates across the banking sector were kept \nat historic lows, and the policy rate remained at 0.5% throughout \n2015. Annual in\ufb02ation was 1.4% at the end of 2015, kept low by falling \ninternational food and fuel prices.

The\u00a0late-\nFebruary cyclone was the most powerful storm on record in the \nSouthern Hemisphere.

The sugar industry was particularly badly hit, and \nproduction in 2016 is expected to fall sharply. Damage was heavy but \ncould have been much worse. The cyclone bypassed the capital city, \nSuva, and its central business district, as well as important tourist \ncenters around Nadi. Major infrastructure was virtually unscathed. \n\nreconstruction. The outlook for exports is positive except for sugar, \nwhich faces loss of preferential access to European markets in 2017. Fiji \nAirways\u2019 opening of a Singapore route in April 2016 will facilitate tourist \naccess from Asia. Discussions over a new direct Beijing\u2013Nadi route are \nalso well advanced. These \ufb02ights will likely boost tourism and could \nenhance opportunities for manufacturers and farmers to airfreight cargo \nto Asian markets. Fijian businesses are already exploring opportunities to \nexpand exports of perishable goods such as fresh \ufb01sh, other seafood, and \n\ufb02owers. Niche markets, including high-value garments and bottled water, \nare also expected to bene\ufb01t from the new routes. \n\nAggregate demand is expected to remain strong in 2016 and 2017. \n\nThe VAT reduction from 15% to 9% in the 2016 budget and strong \ngrowth in personal remittances following Cyclone Winston should boost \nspending. To aid families hurt by the cyclone, the Fiji National Provident \nFund is allowing members to withdraw deposits of $500\u2013$2,500 for \ndisaster recovery. While helpful now, this could deplete savings and \nleave people vulnerable to poverty in old age. \n\nFiscal consolidation planned for 2017 is expected to have broad \n\nimpact. The required extent of consolidation will depend on the \ngovernment\u2019s success in partly divesting selected public assets. If the \nsales do not go ahead, the government could face a much larger budget \nde\ufb01cit than the forecast 2.9% of GDP in 2016 and 2.5% in 2017.\n\n(Figure\u00a03.32.5).

While the economic costs of the cyclone are high, social \nprotection costs soared in March with the announcement of about \n$10\u00a0million in targeted assistance to people who are most vulnerable to \nfalling into poverty. The aid is being made available as immediate relief \nassistance to be paid out over 3 months to 44,169 households currently \nreceiving aid through three social protection programs.\n\nHigher social protection costs press on the government\u2019s \ufb01scal \nposition as it reallocates spending to \ufb01nance emergency relief efforts, \nincluding reorienting planned capital spending toward the rehabilitation \nof infrastructure and basic services in the worst affected areas. Despite \nan expected growth pickup in 2017 and beyond, the government will \nneed to reduce expenditure in other areas to control \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits and \nkeep its debt manageable during recovery (Figure 3.32.6).\n\nIn the medium-term, the government\u2019s focus on private sector \ndevelopment is vital to stimulating domestic and foreign investment, \nand to putting Fiji on a higher growth path. With this in mind, the \ngovernment has been reforming its tax policies to stimulate private \ninvestment and consumption, and to enhance tax system transparency \nand compliance. The 2016 budget removed VAT exemptions and \nintroduced new service and environment taxes, but further reforms are \nneeded to foster private investment and expand the private sector. \nThe government has also introduced worthwhile business \nenvironment reforms, including \ufb01nancial reforms to encourage \ngrowth in small and medium-sized enterprises.

Non-mineral GDP, which better indicates underlying \ntrends and how growth affects people\u2019s livelihoods, is projected to grow by 3.4% in 2016 and 3.6% \nin  2017.  Increasing  reliance  on  resource  extraction  raises  volatility  in  the  economy.\n\nEconomic performance \nIn 2015, the \ufb01rst full year of lique\ufb01ed natural gas (LNG) production, \nthe economy of Papua New Guinea (PNG) grew by 9.9% (Figure 3.33.1). \nGrowth was considerably lower than initially forecast, however, due to \nlower energy prices, unfavorable weather for agriculture, and reduced \nmining output from the closure of the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine. \nMoreover, the early start of LNG production in 2014 reduced the \nstatistical impact of the \ufb01rst full year of production. This performance \nfollowed more than a decade of strong, uninterrupted growth\u2014averaging \n6.8% per annum\u2014supported by high global commodity prices and large \nprivate investments in the mineral sector.\n\nThe agriculture, forestry, and \ufb01sheries sector was affected by \ndrought and low commodity prices in 2015. Growth in the sector \ndecelerated to 2.1% in 2015 from 3.3% in 2014. Output from mining \ncontracted by 3.7%. However, utilities continued to achieve strong \ngrowth, up by 6.0% in 2015, as did transport with 5.0% growth. \nBoth outcomes re\ufb02ected increased business activity in Port Moresby. \nMeanwhile, growth in wholesale and retail trade slowed from 4.0% \nin\u00a02014 to 2.5%. \n\nIn\ufb02ation was steady in 2015 as prices increased by an average of \n5.1%, down only slightly from the previous year\u2019s 5.2%. Although prices \nfor imported oil fell steeply\u2014by more than the PNG kina depreciated\u2014\nthe transmission of lower oil prices to the rest of the economy was \nconstrained by market rigidities in sectors outside of mining. \n\nLow commodity prices depressed export receipts (Figure 3.33.2). \nThis, along with disappointing revenue from mining and petroleum \noperations, created serious \ufb01scal challenges in 2015 (Figure 3.33.3). \nThe\u00a0original 2015 budget projected a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit equivalent to 4.4% \nof GDP, but the government\u2019s 2015 midyear outlook projected an \n$800\u00a0million revenue shortfall and a de\ufb01cit of $1.5 billion, equivalent to \n9.4% of GDP, in the absence of \ufb01scal adjustments. Preliminary estimates \nof the \ufb01nal budget outcome in 2015\u2014which excludes loans and grants\u2014\nsuggests that the government was able to cut spending by the equivalent \nof $1.3 billion, leaving a de\ufb01cit equal to 3.2% of GDP (Figure\u00a03.33.4). \n\nThis chapter was written by Yurendra Basnett of the Papua New Guinea Resident Mission, \nADB, Port Moresby.\n\n3.33.1\u2002Economic growth and inflation\n\nMineral GDP\nNon\u2212mineral GDP\n\nGDP growth\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nK billion\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nEstimate Forecast\n\nSources: Bank of Papua New Guinea; Papua New Guinea \n2016 National Budget; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.33.2\u2002Export price indexes\n\nNon-mineral\nMineral\n\nIndex, 1994 = 100 \n\nCrude oil price\n\n$ per barrel \n\n120\n\nMar\n2011\n\nMar\n2012\n\nMar\n2013\n\nMar\n2014\n\nMar\n2015\n\nSources: Bank of Papua New Guinea; World Bank \nCommodity Price Data (Pink Sheets).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nPapua New Guinea\u2002\u2002245\n\nThe\u00a0smaller de\ufb01cit re\ufb02ected weak budget execution and payment \ndeferrals, but these risk a buildup of expenditure arrears in the future. \nIn June 2014, the Bank of Papua New Guinea, the central bank, \n\ufb01xed the kina exchange rate some 20%\u201330% above the market rate and \nset a trading band with the aim of stemming what it saw as excessive \nkina depreciation. Although the rate has since been allowed to adjust \ngradually, most observers believe the kina is still overvalued relative \nto the currencies of the country\u2019s major trading partners. This has \nworsened foreign currency shortages and drained foreign exchange \nreserves, thereby heightening the risk of a forced and disorderly \ncurrency depreciation.\n\nLNG exports pushed the current account balance into a surplus \nequivalent to 4.6% of GDP in 2015 (Figure 3.33.5). However, this did not \ntranslate into higher foreign reserves or tax revenue because offshore \ndebt repayments climbed and investors were allowed to accelerate \ndepreciation on the gas pipeline when calculating concession payments. \nForeign exchange reserves actually fell from $2.3 billion at the end \nof 2014 (cover for 6.3 months of imports) to $2.1 billion a year later \n(5.6\u00a0months). Dollar shortages at commercial banks have persisted since \n2015, such that the current backlog of exchange requests reportedly \namounts to $500 million. \n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is expected at 4.3% in 2016, less than half the 2015 rate, \nre\ufb02ecting base effects from last year\u2019s \ufb01rst full year of LNG exports \nand \ufb01scal contraction. Although some recovery in oil and gas prices is \nexpected over the next 2 years, average prices in both 2016 and 2017 are \nexpected to remain below 2015 levels, to say nothing of earlier years. \nFood prices are also expected to continue to decline in 2016 before \nincreasing modestly in 2017. These factors will likely push growth even \nlower in 2017, to 2.4%. \n\nmineral sector, which has been the main driver of growth in recent \nyears. The sector is nevertheless expected to remain important to \neconomic growth in the medium term with the start of a few large \nmining projects. Firms appear to be continuing to consolidate their \noperations, however, to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs. \nThis is expected to constrain private sector activity and consumption, \nas well as public revenue from payroll and corporate taxes. Fiscal \nconsolidation is also likely to suppress domestic demand and formal \nemployment. \n\nWith the return of normal rainfall following El Ni\u00f1o-induced \ndrought in 2015, agriculture is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2016 and \n3.4% in 2017. The sector projects higher output of coffee, cocoa, and \npalm oil, but further unfavorable weather in 2016 could pose downside \nrisks. Oil and gas extraction is forecasted to grow by 7.1% in 2016 \nbut then contract by 3.9% in 2017 as the sector enters decline from \ndiminishing reserves. Construction is expected to grow by 3.0% in \n2016 and 3.5% in 2017 ahead of the Asia-Paci\ufb01c Economic Cooperation \nsummit that PNG will host in 2018.

Despite falling commodity prices, LNG export volumes are \nexpected to remain stable in 2016. Papua LNG is currently appraising \ngas resources, and a report due later this year will inform the company\u2019s \ninvestment plan and the possible start of new construction. The coffee \nharvest could be particularly large in 2016, as past experience suggests \nthat coffee plants tend to bounce back after a year of drought stress. \nIn\ufb02ation is expected to accelerate to 6.0% in 2016 and 2017. \n\nThe\u00a0persistence of high in\ufb02ation re\ufb02ects government efforts to sustain \npublic spending and expected kina depreciation. In 2017, recovering \ninternational oil prices are seen to compound in\ufb02ationary pressure \nin\u00a0PNG. \n\nRising \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits and cash \ufb02ow concerns weigh heavily in \nthe government\u2019s near-term policy concerns. Public expenditure is \nbudgeted at $4.8 billion in 2016 (equivalent to 26.2% of GDP) and \nrevenue at $4.1\u00a0billion. With lower revenue projections, the government \nplans \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits equal to 3.8% of GDP in 2016 and 2.2% in 2017. \nThe\u00a0primary de\ufb01cit\u2014estimated without revenues from resource \nexports, capital spending related to them, or interest payments\u2014was \nestimated to equal 8.5% of non-mineral GDP in 2015. This de\ufb01cit is \nseen to narrow modestly to 5.7% in 2016. Planned capital expenditures \naccount for about\u00a010% of total expenditure, and operational expenditure \nthe remainder. Direct\u00a0government \ufb01nancing covers 60% of capital \nexpenditure, while the remaining 40% is \ufb01nanced from concessional \nloans and grants from development partners. \n\nThe government is likely to continue to face pressing cash-\ufb02ow \nproblems in 2016 with the buildup of expenditure arrears from deferred \nobligations, difficulties in \ufb01nancing its de\ufb01cit, and higher debt servicing \ncosts. Any unplanned expenditures, including cost overruns, would \nfurther strain cash-\ufb02ow problems. Expenditures for hosting a meeting \nof African, Caribbean, and Paci\ufb01c leaders in 2016, national elections \nin 2017, and the Asia-Paci\ufb01c Economic Cooperation summit in 2018 \nalso pose risks to budget integrity and \ufb01scal balances. In light of \ufb01scal \nconstraints, the government plans to prioritize the completion of \nongoing capital projects over starting new ones.\n\nCash-\ufb02ow management is growing more difficult for the government \n\nas commercial banks reach their technical limits for exposure to \ngovernment debt. The government is exploring options to \ufb02oat a \n$1\u00a0billion sovereign bond in 2016 to help re\ufb01nance current borrowing, \nbut this could prove costly. External debt servicing costs also appear \nlikely to increase given downward pressure on the kina.\n\nIn 2016, the cost of domestic debt servicing is likely to increase \nsigni\ufb01cantly. Domestic debt stands at about 28% of GDP, while external \ndebt equals 12% of GDP. Nearly half of the domestic debt (48.1%) is in \nTreasury bills for which yields have risen and maturity dates shortened. \nIn 2014, no Treasury bills matured in less than 100 days, but at the start \nof 2016 such short-term Treasury bills accounted for an estimated 24% \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nPapua New Guinea\u2002\u2002247\n\nof the portfolio outstanding. As domestic debt has shifted to shorter \nmaturities, interest costs and re\ufb01nancing risks have risen. The\u00a02016 \nbudget estimates domestic debt repayments coming due this year \nwill reach $3.0 billion, equal to a worrying 93.1% of projected current \nrevenue (Figure 3.33.6). \n\nLNG exports are projected to contribute to a current account surplus \n\nequal to 3.8% of GDP in 2016. This is a smaller surplus than in 2015, in \nline with lower projections for commodity prices. The current account \nsurplus is seen to increase to the equivalent of 7.2% of GDP in 2017 \nwith modest recovery in commodity prices. Coffee and palm oil will \nlikely boost agricultural exports and support the surplus in coming \nyears. Import growth is seen to ease in 2016 and 2017 with an expected \nslowdown in public and private investment.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014fostering economic \ndiversi\ufb01cation to tame growth volatility \nThe PNG economy has grown more dependent on resource exports \nin recent years with the rise of LNG and other extractive industries. \nThis has elevated the in\ufb02uence of global commodity price volatility \non the PNG economy. Strong global commodity prices attracted large \ninvestment in mineral extraction, triggering episodes of high growth. \nWhile this has signi\ufb01cantly boosted government revenues and enabled \nlarge increases in public spending, the distribution of bene\ufb01ts has \ntended to be narrow. To encourage inclusive and sustainable growth, \nthe government needs to ensure that other sectors\u2014agriculture, \nmanufacturing, and services\u2014do not suffer as a result of growth \nin the mineral sector and are able to operate at their full potential. \nHowever, inadequate infrastructure, in\ufb02ated operating costs, and an \nunfavorable business environment have deterred investors and kept \nproductivity low in these sectors, inhibiting broad-based, sustainable \neconomic\u00a0growth. \n\nAnalysis suggests that past increases in output have resulted largely \n\nfrom increases in the labor force, and that the contributions of capital \nand new technology have been negligible except during periods of high \ninvestment in mining. Total factor productivity is estimated to have \nstagnated during the \ufb01rst 3 decades after independence. This highlights \nthe deterioration in the operating environment and the extent of \nproductivity stagnation in sectors other than mining.\n\nDeteriorating infrastructure is an important constraint on \n\nproductive capacity in agriculture, manufacturing, and services. It also \nhampers the government\u2019s ability to expand its delivery of basic health \ncare, education, and other services. The poor quality of the transport \nnetwork limits producers\u2019 access to markets and raises costs for \nservice providers in remote communities. Although large investments \nin infrastructure development over the past few years have begun \nto address the problem, emerging \ufb01scal pressures make it difficult to \nsustain recent progress. \n\n3.33.6\u2002Domestic debt repayments\n\nShare of revenues\n\nLevel\n\nK billion\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nBudget\n\nSources: National budget documents (various years); \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\f248\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nLight manufacturing using domestically sourced agricultural \ninputs appears to be a promising area for improving labor productivity \nin\u00a0PNG. Over the past decade, the agro-processing industry has grown \nby an average of 6.7% per year despite the challenges posed by kina \nappreciation and in\ufb02ation tied to capital in\ufb02ows for LNG development. \nAgro-processing now provides about a quarter of jobs in the formal \nsector and involves small producers as well as large global companies \nincluding Coca Cola and Nestl\u00e9. However, the high cost of doing \nbusiness, poor connectivity, and human capital shortages impede further \ngrowth in this promising industry. \n\nTourism is another industry with strong potential in PNG that \nwould bene\ufb01t from infrastructure investments and could create tens of \nthousands of private sector jobs. Recognizing this potential, the 2016 \nbudget more than triples to $19.9 million government expenditures \nto develop tourism. Developing the potential of PNG as a tourist \ndestination \ufb01rst requires rehabilitating the image of the country as \na safe destination for visitors. It also requires creating a business \nenvironment in which private developers can view PNG as a sound and \nsecure place to invest in hotels and related businesses. \n\nFiscal constraints on the delivery of basic services and public \n\ninfrastructure limit diversi\ufb01cation in the PNG economy. Contracting\u00a0out \nthe maintenance and management of recently developed public \ninfrastructure assets offers opportunities to reduce expenditures and \nthe administrative burden on the public sector while promoting private \nsector growth and employment. \n\nDiversifying the sectors of the economy that can create jobs, and \nfrom which the government can collect revenues, is clearly a policy \npriority if the country is going to avoid the cycles of boom and bust \nassociated with reliance on mining exports. However, the approach to \nfostering diversi\ufb01cation requires a rethink to emphasize institutional \narrangements that rely on private sector enterprises to provide the \nbulk of the capital and know-how needed to develop businesses, and \nto\u00a0keep the public sector focused on providing basic infrastructure and \nessential\u00a0services.\n\n\fSolomon Islands\n\nEconomic  growth  has  recovered  following  severe  floods  in  2014,  but  longer-term  prospects  for \nsustaining growth are uncertain. Exports have been weak, and logging and development assistance \nare expected to decline over the medium term. The government hopes to use fiscal policy to drive \neconomic growth. Policy should continue to safeguard macroeconomic stability while ensuring that \nincreased  spending  is  directed  to  areas  that  promote  sustainable  growth.\n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic growth rebounded to 3.2% in 2015 from 2.0% in 2014, led \nby investment (Figure 3.34.1). Construction picked up from rebuilding \nafter the April 2014 \ufb02oods and on strong business investment. Imports \nof capital goods increased by an estimated 27.4% over the previous year. \nCredit to the private sector expanded by 16.7%, with personal loans \naccounting for most of the increase and manufacturing also absorbing a \nlarge share. \n\nFiscal expansion contributed signi\ufb01cantly to growth. After coming \n\nto power late in 2014, the government used its \ufb01rst budget to signal a \nshift toward expansionary \ufb01scal policy after years of budget surpluses. \nDespite its late approval, the budget left a de\ufb01cit estimated to equal 2.2% \nof GDP. Cash reserves built up in the past fell signi\ufb01cantly, drawn down \nto \ufb01nance de\ufb01cit spending and to repay SI$154 million in domestic debt \nearly. Cash reserves nonetheless remain substantial, equal to about 8.0% \nof GDP. \n\nConsumer prices fell by 0.3% in 2015. Domestic prices normalized \nafter increasing in the aftermath of the 2014 \ufb02oods. Imported in\ufb02ation \nwas contained by lower global commodity prices and the continued \nappreciation of the Solomon Islands dollar against the currencies of \nAustralia and New Zealand, the main sources of imports.\n\nreceipts falling by an estimated 3.6%. This re\ufb02ected, in part, the \ncessation of gold exports following the closure of the country\u2019s sole gold \nmine after the 2014 \ufb02ood. Logging exports, which account for about \ntwo-thirds of export earnings, remained at record levels. However, \nother major export commodities saw volume declines, while softening \ninternational prices deepened the slump in export earnings. \n\nLower global oil prices provided signi\ufb01cant relief to the balance of \n\npayments. Solomon Islands depends heavily on imported fuel, which \nis used to power electricity generation in the country. Lower oil prices \nsaw the fuel import bill fall from the equivalent of 10.2% of GDP \nin\u00a02014 to 7.2% in 2015 (Figure 3.34.2), but the effect of lower prices on \n\nThis chapter was written by Roland Rajah of the Paci\ufb01c Liaison and Coordination Office, \nADB, Sydney.\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n3.34.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.4\n\n2.8\n\n2.0\n\n2.3\n\n3.2\n\n3.0\n\n2.8\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance and Treasury; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nFuel imports\n\nBrent crude oil price\n\n% of GDP\n\n$/barrel\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; World Bank \nCommodity Price Data (Pink Sheets); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nExports continued to be weak, with total merchandise export \n\n3.34.2\u2002Fuel import bill and global oil price\n\n\f250\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nthe balance\u00a0of payments was partly offset by higher import volumes. \nMerchandise import costs rose modestly on increased imports of capital \ngoods, but imported business services fell signi\ufb01cantly, which allowed \nthe current account de\ufb01cit to narrow slightly to 4.6% of GDP. \n\nThe central bank maintained its accommodative stance, capping \nits issuance of Bokolo Bills to SI$710 million and leaving the required \nreserve ratio unchanged at 7.5%.

The pace of investment is expected to ease \nbut remain elevated. Fiscal expansion is also expected to slow. Weak \nexports are seen to continue to detract from growth. Low oil prices are, \nhowever, supporting consumption while easing pressure on the balance \nof payments and providing the authorities with room to continue to \npursue expansionary policy. \n\nThe government plans to continue to increase development spending \nas part of its growth strategy.

However, given the government\u2019s \ufb01scal \ntargets, the central bank will need to carefully monitor developments \nand consider tightening monetary policy if \ufb01scal expansion or other \nin\ufb02ationary pressures prove greater than expected. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014\ufb01scal policy for development\nThe government aims to increase public spending to lay the foundation \nfor sustainable economic growth. The strategy takes advantage of \n\ufb01scal buffers accumulated in recent years, and low global oil prices \nallow monetary policy to remain broadly accommodative. Preserving \n\ufb01scal buffers and ensuring that increased spending is well targeted to \npromote sustainable growth will be critical. Results will likely be better \nif spending is increased gradually. \n\nIf fully implemented, the 2016 budget would largely exhaust \ngovernment cash reserves. Even a rate of budget execution similar \nto last year would signi\ufb01cantly erode cash reserves and constrain \nthe government\u2019s ability to respond to future economic shocks. \nExcessive\u00a0\ufb01scal expansion also risks crowding out private sector activity, \nespecially if the central bank is forced to tighten monetary policy to \ncontain in\ufb02ation. Meanwhile, a weak outlook for revenues argues for \nconserving \ufb01scal reserves for future use. Setting a \ufb02oor for cash reserves \nand strengthening policy coordination between the government and the \ncentral bank would be useful measures to safeguard stability. \n\nExpenditure quality will be critical. Containing payroll costs would \nsave money for higher-priority expenditures. Prioritizing public capital \ninvestment would likely yield the greatest growth impact. While\u00a0the \nshare of spending directed to the development budget\u00a0has increased \ndramatically, it still contains signi\ufb01cant recurrent expenditures. \nTightening its focus on capital investment would bene\ufb01t growth while \nensuring that all recurrent spending is tracked and treated consistently. \nEffective recurrent budget management is particularly important as \nrevenue growth is expected to slow, and funding requirements for \nthe operation and maintenance of new capital investments need to be \nproperly assessed and provided for in future budgets.\n\nLine ministries\u2019 weak execution of budgets\u2014particularly their low \nexecution rates of development budgets\u2014has been a perennial problem. \nThis largely re\ufb02ects systemic capacity constraints, so improving \nexecution will take time, particularly to avoid impairing expenditure \nquality or weakening expenditure controls. In the interim, the \ngovernment can target more implementation-ready projects and consider \ngradually scaling up public investment in line with improvements in \nimplementation capacity.\n\n3.34.5\u2002Inflation\n\nOverall\nDomestic\nImported\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fTimor-Leste\n\nEconomic  growth  slowed  in  2015  as  fiscal  stimulus  eased.

Spending on goods and services was cut by an \nestimated 9.1% year on year to $389.7 million in 2015. Savings on fuel \nfrom lower oil prices accounted for 39.8% of the reduction in goods and \nservices purchases, and there were also signi\ufb01cant cuts to spending on \noperational expenses, building and vehicle maintenance, and domestic \nand international travel by government officials. \n\nof public spending in 2015.

The volume \nof petroleum production exceeded the budget forecast by 16.6%, but \npetroleum revenues were 19.8% less than forecast. Investments through \nTimor-Leste\u2019s Petroleum Fund recorded a net loss of $21.4 million in \n2015\u2014far below the forecast net income of $915.8 million\u2014due to stock \nmarket volatility and foreign exchange losses caused by the appreciation \nof the US dollar, the official currency. Domestic revenues equaled 12.8% \nof GDP in 2015 and grew by 1.2% year on year as a small decline in \ntax receipts was offset by improved collection of fees and charges for \ngovernment services such as electricity. Lower petroleum income and \npoor investment returns saw Timor-Leste\u2019s \ufb01scal position swing from \na surplus equal to 79.9% of GDP in 2014 to a de\ufb01cit estimated at 14.2%. \nThe Petroleum Fund balance consequently edged down to $16.2 billion \nby year-end, or $13,000 per capita.  \n\nThe consumer price index rose by 0.4% in Dili and 1.3% elsewhere \nto yield a weighted annual national in\ufb02ation rate of 0.6% (Figure\u00a03.35.4). \nPrice stability stemmed from falling international prices for key \ncommodity imports, including rice and fuel, and the continued \nappreciation of the US dollar against the currencies of Timor-Leste\u2019s \nmajor trading partners in Southeast Asia.\n\nHeineken broke ground on a new brewery and bottling plant due \n\nto begin operations late this year, and several economic indicators \nsuggest good business conditions in 2015.

Yet the 2016 budget assumes an average oil price of \n$71.2\u00a0per barrel in 2016\u20132020, without taking into account the sharp \ndecline in oil prices since mid-2015. \n\nfor 2016 and 2017 to cut budgeted expenditures excluding grants from \n$1.57 billion in 2014 to $1.30 billion in 2016 and $1.20 billion in 2017. \nHowever, this adjustment has been deferred, and the 2016 budget has \nspending at $1.56 billion this year and projects average annual spending \nat $2.08 billion for 2017\u20132020 to complete major capital investments. \nReforms to boost non-oil revenue collection are being prepared but are \nunlikely to mobilize signi\ufb01cant domestic revenues in the short term. \nDomestic non-oil revenues are expected to average 10.8% of GDP in 2016 \nand 2017. \n\nWhile total budgets in 2015 and 2016 are very similar, the \ncomposition of planned spending has changed signi\ufb01cantly. The \nallocation to Oe-Cusse in 2016 rose sharply by 63.3% as the region\u2019s \ncapital investment budget expanded by 49.6%. This compares with a \n6.9% increase in budgeted capital investment for the rest of the country. \nThese commitments are accommodated by cutting the recurrent budgets \nof most line ministries, which has contributed to lower budgets for \nhealth (\u201321%), education (\u201310%), and agriculture (\u201332%).\n\nThe capital investment budget for major projects during 2016\u20132020 is \nequivalent to 248.8% of last year\u2019s GDP. More than three-quarters of this \nbudget is allocated to roads and bridges, expanding Dili\u2019s airport, new \npublic buildings, and the Tasi Mane project to develop a petrochemical \nindustry on the south coast (Figure 3.35.7). Fully\u00a0implementing this \ninvestment program would strain government management capacity and \nrisk wasting scarce public resources (Figure 3.35.8). The weak outlook for \noil prices may threaten the commercial viability of new state-sponsored \npetrochemical developments, so careful appraisal of the proposed \ninvestment is warranted. \n\nThe 2016 budget law includes reform to restructure the \n\nInfrastructure Fund as an autonomous agency. Legislation specifying \nthe details of the reform has yet to be tabled but could provide a timely \nopportunity to strengthen public investment management. In the short \nterm, disruption associated with reform may delay the implementation \nof the 2016 capital budget.

Timor-Leste\u2019s dependency ratio\u2014\nthe number of children and retired adults for each working-age adult\u2014\nis\u00a0one of the highest in the world.

These trends can provide powerful economic stimulus if \npolicy makes the most of Timor-Leste\u2019s demographic potential. \n\nExpanded access to health care and education have produced clear \ngains since independence, with infant mortality halving from 2003 to \n2009 and primary school enrolment rising from 65.6% in 2007 to 91.9% \nin 2013. However, malnutrition among young children remains high, \nand assessments of learning outcomes highlight the need to further \nstrengthen preschool and primary education (Figure 3.35.10). \n\nInvestments to improve maternal and child health and strengthen \n\neducation will raise long-term growth potential by improving future \nlabor productivity. In the short term, growth may be enhanced and \nformal employment stimulated by reducing the costs employers face \nwhen hiring new workers. Timor-Leste\u2019s labor code imposes a range of \nrestrictive and costly conditions on employers. The minimum wage of \n$115 per month may be high, given current workforce productivity and \nthe large number of unskilled workers without jobs who may be willing \nto work for less. \n\nAt present, only 11.2% of the working-age population is formally \n\nemployed, and half of these workers are directly employed by the \ngovernment. Regulations that impede workers\u2019 move from informal to \nformal employment can be counterproductive and should be reviewed. \nIt is also important to consider how social assistance transfers, equal to \n11.8% of GDP in 2015, modify incentives for human capital accumulation \nand labor force participation.\n\n3.35.8\u2002 Actual and forecast Petroleum Fund \n\nbalances\n\nPetroleum Fund balance\nBalance lost to excess withdrawals\n\n$ billion\n\n2008\n\n2012\n\n2016\n\n2020\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National budget 2016; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.35.9\u2002Demographic projections, 2010\u20132050\n\nPopulation aged 65+\nPopulation aged 15\u201364\nPopulation aged 0\u201314\n\nMillion\n\nDependency ratio\n\n%\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\n2030\n\n2040\n\n2050\n\nSource: Timor-Leste census, 2010.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.35.10\u2002 Incidence of stunting in children \n\naged under 5\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n%\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nR\nD\nP\no\na\nL\n\n \n\ne\nt\ns\ne\nL\n-\nr\no\nm\nT\n\ni\n\na\nu\np\na\nP\n\ni\n\na\ne\nn\nu\nG\nw\ne\nN\n\n \n\na\ni\ns\ne\nn\no\nd\nn\nI\n\ns\ne\nn\np\np\n\ni\n\ni\nl\ni\n\nh\nP\n\na\ni\nd\no\nb\nm\na\nC\n\nu\nt\na\nu\nn\na\nV\n\nm\na\nN\n\n \nt\ne\nV\n\ni\n\nd\nn\na\n\nl\ni\n\na\nh\nT\n\na\ng\nn\no\nT\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\nNote: Most recent data during 2010\u20132014 are shown for \neach country.\nSources: World Development Indicators; Timor-Leste \nFood\u00a0and Nutrition Survey 2013.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fVanuatu\n\nThe  economy  has  been  buffeted  by  a  series  of  negative  shocks,  including  a  tropical  cyclone, \nsevere  El  Ni\u00f1o  conditions,  and  problems  at  the  international  airport.

However, arrivals recovered in the second half \nof the year, such that visitors by air in the whole of 2015 declined by only \n17.3% and by ship by only 10.3% (Figure 3.36.2).

This is because \nrecovery was concentrated in cruise ship arrivals, and those arriving \nby ship tend to spend less locally than do other tourists. Many\u00a0local \ntourism operators continued to report weak market conditions. \n\nIn the aftermath of the cyclone, in\ufb02ation jumped to 5.7% in the \nsecond quarter, driven by a 12.3% increase in food prices. However, \nin\ufb02ation subsequently eased and for 2015 as a whole prices were up by \nonly 2.5%. Costs of transport, health, education, food, and clothing led \nprice increases. \n\nAgriculture was badly affected by the cyclone and suffered further \n\nsetbacks from dry conditions associated with El Ni\u00f1o. Consequently, \nproduction volumes for most major agricultural export commodities \nfell (Figure 3.36.3). Overall export earnings contracted by an estimated \n5.5% as softer international prices for most major exports worsened \nthe\u00a0decline.\n\nThe import bill rose sharply on higher imports of manufactured \ngoods, food, and livestock after the cyclone, which outweighed the \neffects of lower prices for imported oil. The trade balance is estimated \nto have deteriorated to a de\ufb01cit equal to 36.2% of GDP (from 25.3% \nin\u00a02014), driving the current account de\ufb01cit to an estimated 10.4% of \nGDP (compared with a surplus of 2.1% in 2014). \n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2016 and by 3.8% in 2017. \nThe commencement of major reconstruction and several large new \ninfrastructure projects should provide a substantial boost to growth \nin 2016, but this may be offset by the recent cancellation of \ufb02ights to \nPort\u00a0Vila by major international airlines, which will likely weigh heavily \non the tourism industry. In 2017, growth is expected to pick up as \ntourism recovers and infrastructure construction continues. \n\nSnap elections held on 22 January 2016, which were prompted \nby a corruption case that saw 14 members of Parliament convicted in \nlate\u00a02015, led to the formation of a new government in February. A\u00a0new \nPrime Minister was elected unopposed by the new Parliament, which \nhad most legislative districts represented by new representatives. \nThe\u00a0new government is focusing on political and electoral reform, \nas\u00a0well as on more immediate issues such as passing the 2016 budget and \naddressing concerns about runway safety at the international airport. \n\nIn late January, two major airlines operating in the region, \n\nAir\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand and Virgin Australia, announced they would stop \ufb02ying \nto Port Vila over concern about the safety of the runway at Bauer\ufb01eld \nInternational Airport. Qantas, a third major carrier, announced that it \nwas ending its codeshare agreement with Air\u00a0Vanuatu\u2014the government-\nowned airline. The government is undertaking urgent runway repairs, \nbut these will take time and the immediate impact on the tourism \nindustry in 2016 is expected to be signi\ufb01cant. Air\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand \nand Virgin Australia carry around 40% of inbound tourists, and \nthe cancellation of the Qantas codeshare may hurt Air Vanuatu\u2019s \ncustomer\u00a0base. However, Air Vanuatu has increased its \ufb02ights and cut \nticket prices, which may help to offset some of these effects. A\u00a0broader \n\n\f258\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nconcern is the potential damage to Vanuatu\u2019s pro\ufb01le as a tourist \ndestination, particularly coming on the back of Cyclone Pam last year. \nIn\ufb02ation is expected to remain subdued at 1.9% in 2016, re\ufb02ecting \nlower international commodity prices as well as base effects from the \njump in in\ufb02ation in mid-2015 following Cyclone Pam (Figure 3.36.4). \nIn 2017, in\ufb02ation is projected to pick up to 2.4% in line with increased \neconomic activity and rising international commodity prices.\n\nThe new government has yet to release its 2016 budget. The 2016 \n\nbudget policy statement, approved under the previous government, \ntargeted a balanced recurrent budget while taking on concessional debt \nto fund infrastructure investment and keeping the ratio of debt to GDP \nbelow 25%. The central bank is expected to maintain its accommodative \nstance through 2016, as both in\ufb02ation and economic activity will likely \nremain relatively subdued.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is seen to widen further to the equivalent \n\nof 15.0% of GDP in 2016 as imported inputs for reconstruction and \ninfrastructure works rise, and as tourism earnings remain depressed. \nIn\u00a02017, the current account is projected to improve to a de\ufb01cit \nequivalent to 11.0% of GDP as tourism earnings recover. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014delivering infrastructure to \nboost tourism and lift potential growth\nGrowth has been lackluster over the past several years compared with \nthe highs seen in the mid- to late-2000s. While private investment \nhas been weak, the major difference has been lower public capital \ninvestment (Figure 3.36.5). The country\u2019s infrastructure has deteriorated \nfor lack of maintenance. Inadequate funding for the operation of assets \nhas further undermined economic returns on public investments. \n\nTourism, the country\u2019s key economic driver, has suffered as a result \nof deteriorating infrastructure. This is most evident in the cancellation \nof \ufb02ights into Port Vila. However, the underlying issues run deeper. \nVisitor arrivals by air have been \ufb02at since 2012. While cruise ship \nvisitation has risen signi\ufb01cantly, its bene\ufb01ts to the local economy \ndepend on passengers venturing onshore and purchasing local goods \nand services. Many point to deteriorating conditions in Port Vila and \nother areas as a key problem. Responses to a recent survey found the \npoor quality of public services and infrastructure cited most frequently \nas the least appealing aspect of visiting Vanuatu and the area where \nimprovement was most needed. Meanwhile, improving connectivity \nremains crucial to developing tourism on the outer islands. \n\nTo address these problems and broader infrastructure de\ufb01ciencies, \n\nthe government recently approved the Vanuatu Infrastructure Strategic \nInvestment Plan, 2015\u20132024, which plans $407 million in new projects. \nEnsuring adequate funding for operation and maintenance will be \ncritical. Major projects funded by development partners are now \ngetting under way, including upgrades to the international and domestic \nwharves in Port Vila and to Bauer\ufb01eld International Airport, as well as \nurban development projects to improve public facilities in Port Vila.\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n3.36.4\u2002 Headline inflation and \nkey\u00a0components\n\nHeadline\nFood\nTransport\nUtilities\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Vanuatu National Statistics Office; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.36.5\u2002Government expenditures\n\nCurrent\nCapital\n\n% of GDP\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Vanuatu Department of Finance and Treasury; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fNorth Paci\ufb01c economies\n\nRecent  performance  across  these  economies  was  mixed  and  is  expected  to  remain  so.  Strong \ngrowth  continued  in  Palau  driven  by  higher  tourist  arrivals,  while  GDP  in  the  Republic  of  the \nMarshall  Islands  and  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  contracted  in  the  absence  of  public \ninvestment.  Growth  is  expected  to  slow  this  year  in  Palau  as  tourism  faces  capacity  constraints. \nRecovery  in  the  near  term  in  the  other  two  economies  hinges  on  their  ability  to  access  capital \ngrants  to  fund  major  infrastructure  projects. \n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth accelerated to an estimated 6.7% in Palau (Figure 3.37.1) while \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and the Federated States of \nMicronesia (FSM) continued to contract in FY2015 (ended 30 September \n2015), though by less than in FY2014. The improvement in Palau \nfrom 4.7% growth in FY2014 re\ufb02ected strong performance in tourism \n(Figure\u00a03.37.2). Tourism receipts in FY2015 were equivalent to 54.8% of \nGDP, up from 39.7% in FY2010. Visitor arrivals grew by 32.5% in FY2015 \nto reach 166,136, more than twice the number in FY2010. The\u00a0increase \nin arrivals has been driven by expanded direct charter \ufb02ights from \nHong\u00a0Kong, China and Macau, China. Arrivals from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) accounted for 54.0% of all arrivals in FY2015, \nup from just 1.2% in FY2010. Despite a reduction in April of the number \nof charter \ufb02ights allowed, from 48 per month to 32, arrivals remained \nstrong as airlines adapted by \ufb02ying larger aircraft.\n\nThe RMI and the FSM continue to rely on public infrastructure \nprojects for growth, their economies otherwise characterized by small \nprivate sectors and widespread informal employment. The lack of new \nprojects in these economies re\ufb02ects continued problems in utilizing \ncapital grants \ufb02owing from the compacts of free association that all \nthree North Paci\ufb01c economies have with the US. In addition, extreme \nweather exerted downward pressure on GDP growth. \n\nOutput in the FSM contracted for a fourth consecutive year, with \n\nGDP declining by an estimated 1.5% in FY2015 following a series of \ndevastating typhoons that affected all four of its states (Figure 3.37.3). \nIn March 2015, Typhoon Maysak destroyed an estimated 90% of food \ncrops and hundreds of homes in Chuuk and on outlying islands in Yap. \nIn May, Typhoon Noul struck the main islands of Yap, and Typhoon \nDolphin caused severe \ufb02ooding and damage in Pohnpei and Kosrae. \nPrivate consumption fell by 3.1%. Construction contracted by 16.6% with \nthe completion of several compact-funded infrastructure projects, and \ncapacity constraints hindered pickup through reconstruction. \n\nThis chapter was written by Emma Veve and Cara Tinio of the Paci\ufb01c Department, ADB, \nManila; and Prince Cruz, consultant, Paci\ufb01c Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.37.1\u2002 Supply-side contributions to growth \n\nin Palau\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n6.7\n\n7.0\n\n4.4\n\n3.1\n\n4.7\n\n3.0\n\n\u20131.7\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year. \nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of \nPalau FY2014 Economic Review.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.37.2\u2002 Visitor arrivals in Palau by source\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nJapan\nTaipei,China\nRepublic of Korea\nOthers\n\nThousand visitors\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n200\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year. \nSource: Palau Visitor\u2019s Authority and Office of Planning \nand Statistics, Ministry of Finance.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f260\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nThe RMI economy contracted by 0.5% in FY2015 as election-related \n\nspending brought a slight improvement from a 1.0% decline in FY2014 \n(Figure 3.37.4). The most recent major infrastructure project, an airport \nroad realignment, was completed in FY2013. Construction fell by 32.9% \nin FY2015 after an 11.9% decline in FY2014. The hotel and restaurant \nsector shrank by 4.3%, partly re\ufb02ecting the government\u2019s purchase of a \n36-room hotel to use as a campus for the University of the South Paci\ufb01c. \nThis reduced the number of rooms available in Majuro to around 150. \nLike the FSM, the RMI was affected by several typhoons, the strongest \nbeing Typhoon Nangka, which hit in July.\n\nLower international food and fuel prices pushed down in\ufb02ation \n(Figure 3.37.5). In Palau, in\ufb02ation fell to 2.2% in FY2015, the lowest since \nFY2010 (a year when GDP contracted). The second phase of a tobacco \ntax hike pushed up the prices of tobacco products by 14.6%. Cheaper fuel \nprices caused transportation and utility costs to fall by 5.0%, but food \nprices rose by 3.3% on strong demand. In the RMI, lower\u00a0commodity \nprices pushed down utility and transportation costs, leaving in\ufb02ation a \nminimal 0.5%. In the FSM, consumer prices declined by an estimated \n1.1% in FY2015 as global food and fuel prices fell, despite supply \nshocks caused by typhoons. A decline in private consumption also \ndrove\u00a0de\ufb02ation. \n\nIn FY2015, all three north Paci\ufb01c economies continued to record \n\ufb01scal surpluses (Figure 3.37.6). Additional revenues from \ufb01shing license \nfees provided much-needed revenue, especially for the FSM and the RMI \n(Figure 3.37.7). In the RMI, \ufb01shing license fees were estimated at 30.7% \nof total revenues excluding grants in FY2015, up from 11.4% the previous \nyear. In the FSM, this share rose from 40.5% in FY2014 to 58.2%.\n\nIn October, Palau passed a law converting 80% of its territorial \n\nwaters into a marine sanctuary, prohibiting commercial \ufb01shing, \noil drilling, and seabed mining. To provide alternative livelihoods \nfor affected households, the government will promote ecotourism. \nFishing\u00a0license fees, which accounted for 8.5% of total revenues \nexcluding grants in FY2015, are expected to decline in the future. \n\nThe North Paci\ufb01c economies lack manufacturing, so they depend \non imports of goods. Their current account positions depend heavily \non international commodity prices and the status of infrastructure \nprojects. Cheaper global prices for fuel and other commodities, and \nhigher \ufb01shing license revenues, pushed the current account balances \nof all these economies into surplus in FY2015 (Figure 3.37.8). In Palau, \nstrong growth in tourism provided an additional push to achieve a \nsmall current account surplus. In the RMI and the FSM, the lack of \nconstruction helped reduce the import bill.\n\nEconomic prospects \nThe growth outlook in Palau remains positive because of tourism. \nIn the\u00a0RMI and the FSM, recovery will depend on their ability to \nresolve their access to capital investment funds under their compact \nagreements. Meanwhile, drought associated with El Ni\u00f1o could, \nif\u00a0it\u00a0intensi\ufb01es, bring\u00a0prolonged economic hardship. \n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20138\n\n3.37.3\u2002 Supply-side contributions to growth \nin the Federated States of Micronesia\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n\u20130.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.5\n\n3.5\n\n\u20131.5\n\n\u20133.6\n\n\u20133.4\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year. \nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Federated States \nof Micronesia FY2014 Economic Review.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.37.4\u2002 Supply-side contributions to growth \n\nin the Republic of Marshall Islands\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n3.9\n\n1.9\n\n1.3\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u20130.5\n\n\u20131.0\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year. \nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands FY2014 Economic Review.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.37.5\u2002Inflation\n\nBrent crude\noil price\n\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands\nFederated States of Micronesia\nPalau\n\n$/barrel\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year. \nSources: Federated States of Micronesia FY2014 Economic \nReview; Republic of the Marshall Islands FY2014 Economic \nReview; Republic of Palau FY2014 Economic Review; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nNorth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002261\n\n3.37.1\u2002Explaining changes in the Palau GDP forecasts\n\n3.37.6\u2002 Fiscal balance\n\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands\nFederated States of Micronesia\nPalau\n\n \n\n% of GDP\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year. \nSources: Federated States of Micronesia FY2014 Economic \nReview; Republic of the Marshall Islands FY2014 Economic \nReview; Republic of Palau FY2014 Economic Review; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nIn Asian Development Outlook 2015 (ADO 2015), published in March 2015, \nPalau\u2019s economy was projected to expand by 8.0% in FY2015 (ended \n30\u00a0September 2015). In the October ADO 2015 Update, the projection \nwas revised up to 10.0%. In this ADO 2016, GDP growth in FY2015 is \nnow estimated at 6.7%. The main factor behind changes are recent trends \nin\u00a0tourism.\n\nVisitor arrivals reached a then record high of 125,427 in FY2014, up by \n13.4% from the previous year. Rapid growth in arrivals from the PRC then \npushed arrivals to 114,000 in the \ufb01rst half of FY2015. The Government of \nPalau was concerned by the steep increase in arrivals, especially in light of \nthe low carrying capacity of public infrastructure and tourist attractions. \nCharter \ufb02ights from Hong Kong, China and Macau, China\u2014the main links \nfrom the PRC\u2014were reduced from 48 to 32 per month. Final \ufb01gures for \nFY2015 show arrivals at 166,136, up by 32.5% from the previous \ufb01scal year. \nWhen ADO 2015 was being prepared, GDP growth for FY2014 was \n\nestimated at 6.9%. In mid-2015, official data for Palau was released, re\ufb02ecting \nhigher GDP growth at 8.0% in FY2014 with stronger contributions from \nwholesale and retail trade, \ufb01nancial intermediation, and information and \ncommunication technology. The latest data, released in October 2015, \nshow growth in FY2014 revised down to 4.7%, partly because real estate, \nmanufacturing, and \ufb01nancial intermediation contracted. \n\nThe latest revision also affected GDP growth \ufb01gures for previous years, \n\ndowngrading most of them, particularly from FY2011 to FY2014. This \nsuggests unexpectedly weak transmission of growth in visitor arrivals into \nrelated economic activity. In view of this, the impact of the sharp increase \nin visitor arrivals in FY2015 is likely to be more muted, hence the lower \nestimate of GDP growth for the year.\n\nPalau\u2019s economic expansion is expected to fall back to 3.0% in \nFY2016 as growth in tourist numbers slows (Box 3.37.1). This will be \npartly offset by growth in construction as hotel rooms are added to \nimprove room availability. The double-digit growth rates for tourist \narrivals in the past 2 \ufb01scal years are unlikely to be sustained as hotels \nand tourist attractions operated nearly at capacity in FY2015. In the \n\ufb01rst quarter of FY2016, arrivals dropped by 11.7% from a year earlier, \nincluding a 13.6% drop in arrivals from the PRC, mainly because \nan aircraft \ufb02ying from Hong Kong, China required maintenance. \nVisitor\u00a0arrivals from other markets also fell signi\ufb01cantly, notably \nTaipei,China down 22.0% and Japan down 6.4%. Lower arrivals are \nexpected to persist through FY2016. \n\nPalau is forecast to rebound in FY2017 with 7.0% GDP growth. \n\nThe expected 9.2% increase in rooms is seen to enable business \nexpansion in hotels and restaurants, retail trade, and transportation and \ncommunication.

Support from development partners for \nreform to state-owned enterprises, in line with supportive legislation \npassed in 2015, could pave the way for private sector growth. \n\nGrowth in the FSM is forecast to reach 2.5% in FY2016 and 3.5% in \n\nFY2017 on expenditures from infrastructure grants connected to the \ncompact agreement and on higher revenue from \ufb01shing licenses. \n\nLow in\ufb02ation is expected to persist in the North Paci\ufb01c in FY2016 \n\nbut then accelerate slightly in FY2017 in line with international fuel \nand food prices. The RMI is projected to run 2.0% in\ufb02ation in FY2016, \nrising to 2.5% in FY2017, re\ufb02ecting its weak economic performance. \nReconstruction in the FSM is expected to temper de\ufb02ation to 0.3% in \nFY2016 and contribute to in\ufb02ation of 0.3% in 2017. In\ufb02ation in Palau is \nseen to ease further to 1.5% in FY2016, as the impact from the second \nphase of a tobacco tax hike in January 2015 fades, then climb to 2.5% \nin\u00a0FY2017.\n\nCurrent account surpluses are expected to continue except in Palau, \n\nwhere de\ufb01cits equal to 2.3% of GDP in FY2016 and 1.3% in FY2017 are \nforecast as increased imports of construction materials for tourism \nventures and lower tourism revenues more than offset lower fuel \nprices. The current account surplus in the RMI is projected to reach \nthe equivalent of 11.1% of GDP in FY2016 and 8.9% in FY2017 as \ufb01shing \nlicense revenues rise. In the FSM, the current account surplus is seen to \nexpand to 19.5% of GDP in FY2016 and 30.1% in FY2017.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014ensuring \ufb01scal sustainability\nBecause their compact agreements with the US and the accompanying \ngrants are scheduled to end in FY2023, the three North Paci\ufb01c \neconomies face a common challenge over the medium to long term \nof matching expenditure to expected revenues (including trust fund \nearnings) without the hefty grants that have supplemented revenues \nover the years (Figure 3.37.9). This must be achieved through \ufb01scal \nconsolidation and strengthened economic growth. The difficulty of \nachieving \ufb01scal sustainability varies, however, among the economies. \n\nPalau is arguably the best placed\u2014through strong growth in \n\ntourism\u2014to achieve sustainability. It is seeking to better manage its fast-\ngrowing tourism industry by controlling and coordinating multiple policy \nlevers\u2014foreign investment, public investment, taxation, small business \ndevelopment, environmental management\u2014to translate high visitor \ndemand into a \ufb02ow of higher-value tourists and more local capture of \ntheir expenditure. This is an enormous challenge. Necessary\u00a0tax reform \nhas been delayed in the Senate and seems unlikely to progress in this \nelection year. Effective policy implementation and enforcement will \nrequire political commitment, effort from the whole government, and \nan improved public understanding of the issues and the difficult choices \nthey pose. \n\nThe FSM and the RMI require considerable effort to lift their growth \n\nrates while simultaneously managing expenditures closely. Key to \nboosting growth is the strategic use of capital investment funds supplied \nboth through compact agreements and from development partners. \n\n3.37.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nPalau\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20022.0\n\n11.1\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20130.3\n\n19.5\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20132.3\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20028.9\n\n\u20023.5\n\n\u20020.3\n\n30.1\n\n\u20027.0\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20131.3\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of \nthat\u00a0year.\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.37.8\u2002Current account balance\n\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands\nFederated States of Micronesia\nPalau\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year. \nSources: Federated States of Micronesia FY2014 Economic \nReview; Republic of the Marshall Islands FY2014 Economic \nReview; Republic of Palau FY2014 Economic Review; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nNorth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002263\n\nThe FSM developed a strategic capital investment plan in 2015 that \n\n3.37.9\u2002Total revenues and grants\n\nprioritizes public investment projects through a process coordinated \nby the national and state governments.

Growth \nin  the  Cook  Islands  slowed  for  lack  of  infrastructure  projects  and  sufficient  accommodation  for \ntourists.  Outward  migration  for  employment  supports  consumption  and  helps  alleviate  poverty, \nbut  it  also  hampers  economic  growth.  Opportunities  in  agriculture,  related  light  industry,  and \ntourism  offer  promise  as  potential  growth  engines.\n\nEconomic performance \nIn contrast with Samoa and Tonga, and despite growth in its own \ntransport and energy sectors, the Cook Islands economy contracted \nby 0.5% in FY2015 (ended 30 June 2015) as activity in construction, \n\ufb01nance, and business services slowed (Figure 3.38.1). A shortage of \naccommodation in the peak tourist season constrained visitor arrivals, \nand numbers from Australia and Canada, which jointly contribute \none-\ufb01fth of all arrivals, were disappointing. Growth accelerated to \n1.4% in Samoa and to 3.4% in Tonga as lower oil prices reduced input \ncosts in the transport and electricity sectors. In Tonga, preparations for \ncoronation celebrations in July 2015 and improved execution of public \ninfrastructure projects contributed to higher growth. Samoa\u2019s relatively \nlow growth rate re\ufb02ects lower agricultural output, which declined by \nmore than 11%, and sluggish construction.\n\nIn\ufb02ation in the Cook Islands accelerated to 3.0% in FY2015 as a result \n\nof higher alcohol and tobacco taxes and a weaker New Zealand dollar, \nits official currency (Figure 3.38.2). In Samoa, in\ufb02ation averaged 1.9% as \nhigher domestic food prices caused by lower agricultural output more \nthan offset price declines for transport and imported food. This\u00a0marked \na sharp reversal of de\ufb02ation in FY2014. Tonga experienced de\ufb02ation at \n0.7% as transport and utility prices fell because of lower fuel\u00a0prices. \n\nIn the Cook Islands, the overall FY2015 \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit reached 1.7% of \n\nGDP, up from only 0.1% the previous year on increased infrastructure \nspending (Figure 3.38.3). In Tonga, a surplus equal to 1.7% of GDP \nin FY2014 turned into a small de\ufb01cit of 0.2% in FY2015 with higher \ncapital spending, including for cyclone reconstruction. In Samoa, a \n19.3% decline in external grants prompted the government to cut \nexpenditures, narrowing the de\ufb01cit to the equivalent of 3.9% of GDP. \nDebt sustainability is a concern across these economies. Public \ndebt rose in all three economies in FY2015 and, by the end of the \ufb01scal \nyear, equaled 23.0% of GDP in the Cook Islands, 55.3% in Samoa, and \n51.3% in Tonga (Figure 3.38.4).

Private sector \ncredit grew by 17.6% year on year to June 2015 as credit to businesses \nand households increased. The National Reserve Bank of Tonga also \nmaintained an accommodative monetary policy. Lending rates of around \n8.5% (down from 12%\u201314% in the aftermath of the global \ufb01nancial crisis) \nand a government-managed fund scheme underpinned an 8.6% growth \nin credit to the private sector in FY2015 from 0.7% in the previous year. \nIn the Cook Islands, credit from commercial banks grew by 1.1% in \nFY2015 despite relative stability in interest rates. This re\ufb02ected a change \nin the banks\u2019 past preference for consolidating balance sheets, which \nsucceeded in signi\ufb01cantly reducing the prevalence of nonperforming \nloans in their portfolios.\n\nSamoa\u2019s current account de\ufb01cit was equivalent to 4.8% of GDP \n\nin FY2015, 2.2 percentage points narrower than the year before \n(Figure\u00a03.38.5). This was the result of lower imports of services and \nhigher remittances. The de\ufb01cit was offset in part by external capital \ngrants and drawdowns on loans. Foreign exchange reserves remained \nat a reasonable level, providing cover for 5.2 months of goods imports, \ndespite declining from $155.2 million in FY2014 to $132.8 million. Tonga\u2019s \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit widened to the equivalent of 8.3% of GDP in \nFY2015 from 5.0% in FY2014, mainly due to increased merchandise \nimports related to coronation celebrations and lower earnings from \nexports of services. However, foreign exchange reserves ended FY2015 \nstable at $150.8 million, sufficient to cover 11.3 months of\u00a0imports.\n\nEconomic prospects \nEconomic activity in the Cook Islands is expected to be \ufb02at in \nFY2016 and to grow modestly by 0.2% in FY2017, supported by public \ninvestment and a slight improvement in tourism. This forecast takes into \naccount a downbeat outlook for economic growth in both New\u00a0Zealand \nand Australia, which are important export destinations and source \nmarkets for tourists. Limited local capacity to implement capital projects \nand a shortage of tourist accommodation in the peak holiday seasons \nconstrain growth in the near term. The loss of skilled workers to \noutward migration also hinders growth.\n\nWith \ufb01shing and tourism activity expected to increase, Samoa\u2019s \neconomy is forecast to grow by 2.0% in FY2016 before slowing to 0.5% \nin FY2017 as nonfood manufacturing declines with the expected closure \nof a car parts factory. By contrast, the outlook for Tonga is positive, at \nleast in the medium term. Preparations for the South Paci\ufb01c Games and \ninvestments in tourism and government offices are expected to uphold \ngrowth at 2.8% in FY2016 and 2.7% in FY2017. \n\nIn\ufb02ation in the Cook Islands is forecast at 1.8% in FY2016 and \n2.0% in FY2017 as import prices rise.

Demand generated by the South Paci\ufb01c \nGames could exert additional upward pressure on prices.\n\nThe Cook Islands current account balance is forecast to improve \non continued growth in tourism earnings.

In Tonga, the current account de\ufb01cit \nis expected to narrow signi\ufb01cantly (to\u00a0the equivalent of 1.9% of GDP) in \nFY2016 as import costs decline. The\u00a0de\ufb01cit is seen to widen to 3.2% in \nFY2017. These de\ufb01cits are expected to be largely offset by foreign grants \nand concessional loans.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014raising growth and creating jobs\nA common policy challenge facing these three South Paci\ufb01c economies \nis to achieve higher economic growth to generate new jobs. Their \nworking-age populations have the option of emigrating to labor markets \nin New Zealand and Australia with relative ease. This migration brings \nin remittances\u2014in\ufb02ows that are particularly signi\ufb01cant for Samoa and \nTonga\u2014but the associated labor drain stymies growth and creates a \ncycle of low growth that encourages further emigration, which further \ndepresses economic activity. \n\nThe Cook Islands economy suffers from low tourism growth due to \nshortages of accommodation during the peak season. The lack of large \nnew investments in hotels constrains tourism and broader economic \ngrowth. Without adding accommodation, tourism earnings can be raised \nonly by increasing local inputs and attracting more high-end tourists, \nbut these measures are unlikely to spur employment growth. Easing \napproval procedures for land leases and new tourism developments \ncould expedite investment and facilitate growth in the private sector, \nthus creating jobs in the tourism industry.\n\nSamoa has struggled with low growth following a series of disasters. \n\nNonfood manufacturing has been contracting for some years, causing \nemployment in the sector to dwindle. Growth in tourism has been slow \nas well. The availability of new sources of \ufb01nance for agribusiness holds \npromise to create employment, both formal and informal, but may not \nbe sufficient to catalyze sustained acceleration in economic growth. \nA higher growth path for Tonga over the medium term requires \nsustained commitment to reform to improve the business environment. \nIn the absence of reform, growth is expected to revert to a low \ntrajectory\u2014at or below the historical average growth rate of 1.7%\u2014in the \nlong run, once activity related to post-cyclone reconstruction and the \nhosting of the South Paci\ufb01c Games is completed. As in Samoa, growth in \nagriculture and related light industry development, as well as efforts to \nattract more tourist spending, appear to be the most promising avenues \nfor increasing employment in Tonga.\n\n3.38.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nCook Islands\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nSamoa\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nTonga\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20021.8\n\n37.3\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20134.3\n\n\u20022.8\n\n\u20130.3\n\n\u20131.9\n\n\u20020.2\n\n\u20022.0\n\n41.3\n\n\u20020.5\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20135.1\n\n\u20022.7\n\n\u20020.5\n\n\u20133.2\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of \nthat\u00a0year.\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.38.5\u2002Current account balance\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n% of GDP\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n\u201325\n\n2011\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement; Samoa Ministry of Finance; Tonga Ministry \nof Finance.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fSmall island economies\n\nAchieving  fiscal  sustainability  despite  dependence  on  volatile  and  uncertain  revenue  sources  is \na  common  challenge  for  the  small  island  economies  of  Kiribati,  Nauru,  and  Tuvalu.  Record  high \nfishing  license  revenues  and  investments  from  development  partners  have  underpinned  rising \npublic  expenditure  and  growth.  However,  in  Nauru,  damage  to  port  facilities  has  disrupted \nphosphate  exports  and  caused  steep  GDP  contraction.\n\nEconomic performance \nKiribati\u2019s economy grew by 3.0% in 2015, driven by spending on \ninfrastructure projects to upgrade a road and improve sanitation \nusing development partner funds. Higher \ufb01shing license revenues that \nenabled increased government spending also contributed to growth \n(Figure\u00a03.39.1). Nauru\u2019s economy is estimated to have contracted by \n10.0% in FY2015 (ended 30 June 2015) after damage to the port\u2019s \nmooring system disrupted phosphate exports (which declined by \ntwo-thirds) and imports of fuel and other supplies. These losses \nwere partly offset by increased government and consumer spending. \nTuvalu\u00a0grew by 2.0% in 2015 with stimulus from higher public spending \non infrastructure projects and high \ufb01shing license revenues. \n\nIn\ufb02ation was lower in Kiribati as prices rose by only 1.4% in 2015 \n\ndespite depreciation of the Australian dollar, the official currency \n(Figure\u00a03.39.2). In\ufb02ation was slightly higher in Tuvalu at 2.0% in 2015. \nIn both Kiribati and Tuvalu, lower food and fuel prices helped keep \nprices in check. In Nauru, in\ufb02ation surged to 11.4% in FY2015 because of \ndisrupted supply of consumer goods through the damaged port and the \nelimination of retail fuel subsidies. \n\nThe strongest El Ni\u00f1o in nearly 20 years has brought record tuna \nmigrations to the region. As signatories to the Nauru Agreement, all \nthree economies have bene\ufb01ted in recent years from higher licensing \nfees under the vessel day scheme. In 2015, \ufb01shing license revenues as a \nshare of GDP were 99% for Kiribati, 21% for Nauru, and 64% for Tuvalu.\n\nGovernment revenue declined by 14.3% in Kiribati, while \nexpenditure increased by 3.5%. These trends replaced the large \n\ufb01scal surplus in 2014 with a small de\ufb01cit equivalent to 1.1% of GDP \nin 2015 (Figure 3.39.3). Nauru fell into \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit in 2015 as several \nrevenue lines underperformed. In Tuvalu, revenues grew slower than \nexpenditure to leave a much narrower \ufb01scal surplus than in 2014.\nKiribati maintained its current account surplus with strong \n\nlicense fee and remittance in\ufb02ows (Figure 3.39.4).

Nauru will bene\ufb01t as well from the \ngradual integration into the economy of about 850 refugees who recently \ncleared the Australian-run Regional Processing Centre. Most of these \nrefugees are of working age and can signi\ufb01cantly augment the existing \nlabor force of 6,400. Many possess skills that could help address skills \nshortages, and some have already taken up local positions while others \nhave opened new businesses. \n\nExpansionary \ufb01scal policy in Tuvalu in 2016 is expected to help \nboost growth to 3.5% as the government increases spending to develop \nnew accommodation ahead of the Paci\ufb01c Island Leaders Meeting \nin\u00a02016. The government plans higher spending to build health centers \nand classrooms on outer islands and so make public expenditures \nmore inclusive. Growth is expected to moderate to 3.0% in 2017 as the \ntemporary boost to the economy from the leaders\u2019 meeting fades.\nIn Kiribati, in\ufb02ation is expected to be low at 0.3% in 2016 as \ninternational prices remain depressed, then to rise to 0.8% as prices \nrecover, particularly for oil. In\ufb02ation in Nauru is forecast to slow but \nremain elevated at 6.6% in FY2016 as problems with the moorings are \nlikely to persist and continue to disrupt imports. However, in\ufb02ation is \nseen to ease considerably in FY2017 to 1.7% after repairs to the mooring \nsystem are completed. In Tuvalu, in\ufb02ation will likely accelerate to 3.5% \nin 2016, driven largely by demand created through \ufb01scal expansion, then \nmoderate to 2.0% in FY2017 in line with lower public spending.\n\nThe current account in Kiribati is projected to narrow in 2016 but \n\nmaintain a surplus equal to 15% of GDP supported by \ufb01shing license \nrevenues and remittances from workers overseas. A de\ufb01cit equivalent \nto 10% of GDP is forecast for 2017 as \ufb01shing license fees are expected \nto moderate, and workers\u2019 foreign incomes and remittances to decline. \nIn Tuvalu, the current account is projected to record a de\ufb01cit equal to \n21.4% of GDP in 2016 as public investments rise, before narrowing to \n18.7% in 2017 with \ufb01scal consolidation.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014achieving \ufb01scal sustainability \nThe main macroeconomic challenge facing the small Paci\ufb01c island \neconomies is to achieve \ufb01scal stability when existing revenue sources \nare volatile and highly uncertain. In early 2016, in response to \nfalling prices for skipjack tuna, the three countries renegotiated the \nSouth\u00a0Paci\ufb01c Tuna Treaty with the US and agreed on lower access fees \nfor 2016. Negotiations with the US are expected to continue. Further \nfalls in skipjack tuna prices in 2017 pose a downside risk to \ufb01scal and \nGDP growth projections for all three economies.\n\nFishing license revenues have contributed to annual budget \nsurpluses in Kiribati in recent years. Since 2012, the government \nand development partners have worked to implement the Kiribati \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSmall island economies\u2002\u2002269\n\n3.39.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nKiribati\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nNauru\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nTuvalu\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n2015\n\n\u2002\u20021.8\n\n\u2002\u20020.3\n\n\u200215.0\n\n2016\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u2002\u20020.8\n\n\u201310.0\n\n\u2002\u20023.0\n\n\u2002\u20026.6\n\n.\u2025\n\n\u200215.0\n\n\u2002\u20021.7\n\n.\u2025\n\n\u2002\u20023.5\n\n\u2002\u20023.5\n\n\u201321.4\n\n\u2002\u20023.0\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u201318.7\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n... = data not available.\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that \nyear for Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year \nfor Kiribati and Tuvalu.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nEconomic Reform Program, which aims to restore \ufb01scal sustainability \nby improving revenue performance and containing public expenditure \nwhile safeguarding vital public services and infrastructure investments. \nThe\u00a0program reduces the amounts the government is allowed to draw \ndown from its Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund, a sovereign wealth \nfund that was nearly depleted by high \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits in the wake of the \nglobal economic crisis. Development partners have encouraged the \ngovernment to reinvest windfall \ufb01shing license revenues in the fund to \nbuild its real value per capita.\n\nNauru currently bene\ufb01ts from higher income associated with \n\nAustralia\u2019s Regional Processing Centre and a related refugee \nresettlement program, \ufb01shing license fees, and, until recently, phosphate \nexports. In\u00a0late 2015, the government established its new Nauru \nIntergenerational Trust Fund to deposit a share of windfall revenues in \na long-term investment vehicle intended eventually to provide a stable \nsource of budget \ufb01nancing. The current budget allocates A$20.4\u00a0million, \nor about 18% of total domestic revenue, for transfer to the fund once it \nbecomes fully operational. Regular annual contributions are to follow \na formula applied to Nauru\u2019s domestic revenues. The Government of \nAustralia will also contribute to the fund annually and participate in \nits governing committee. Other partners have also been invited to join. \nThe\u00a0trust fund is a crucial step forward at a time when Nauru\u2019s budget \nrelies increasingly on uncertain and unsustainable revenue sources. \nHowever, broader reforms remain critical. In particular, the government \nneeds to establish a comprehensive \ufb01scal framework to ensure that \nit can continue to contribute to the fund while maintaining adequate \n\ufb01scal buffers, keeping consumption expenditure sustainable, and using a \nhigher share of spending to develop human capital and infrastructure. \nThe substantial increase in \ufb01shing license revenues has been the \ndriving force behind \ufb01scal expansion in Tuvalu, where expenditures \nare up by 28% in the 2016 budget. With assistance from development \npartners, the government has restored the value of the Consolidated \nInvestment Fund of the Tuvalu Trust Fund, from which the government \nsources supplementary \ufb01nancing to cover budget de\ufb01cits. The value \nof the trust fund rose from A$6.2 million at the end of 2008 to \nA$25.6\u00a0million at the end of 2015. This places the government in a strong \nposition to consolidate its \ufb01nances without severely disrupting public \nservice delivery. Fiscal consolidation is crucial to put future spending \non a sustainable footing. Introducing a medium-term \ufb01scal framework \nthat targets a structural surplus would strengthen Tuvalu\u2019s capacity to \nmanage revenue volatility, and placing more savings in the Tuvalu Trust \nFund would help ensure resilience in the face of adverse shocks.\n\n\f\fSTATISTICAL \nAPPENDIx\n\n\fStatistical notes and tables\n\nThe statistical appendix presents selected economic indicators for \nthe 45\u00a0developing member economies of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in 18 tables. The economies are grouped into \ufb01ve subregions: \nCentral\u00a0Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Paci\ufb01c. \nMost of the tables contain historical data from 2011 to 2015; some have \nforecasts for 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in \nstatistical methodology, de\ufb01nitions, coverage, and practices make full \ncomparability impossible. The national income accounts section is \nbased on the United Nations System of National Accounts, while the \ndata on balance of payments are based on International Monetary \nFund (IMF) accounting standards. Historical data were obtained from \nofficial sources, statistical publications and databases, and documents \nof ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank. For some economies, data for \n2015 are estimated from the latest available information. Projections \nfor 2016 and 2017 are generally ADB estimates made on the bases of \navailable quarterly or monthly data, though some projections are from \ngovernments.\n\nMost economies report by calendar year. The following record their \n\ngovernment \ufb01nance data by \ufb01scal year: Armenia; Azerbaijan; Brunei \nDarussalam; the Cook Islands; Hong Kong, China; Kazakhstan; the \nKyrgyz Republic; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR); \nSamoa; Singapore; Taipei,China; Tajikistan; Thailand; and Uzbekistan. \nThe Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, the Republic of Marshall \nIslands, and Palau report government \ufb01nance and balance-of-payments \ndata by \ufb01scal year. South Asian countries (except for the Maldives \nand Sri\u00a0Lanka), Myanmar, Samoa, and Tonga report all variables by \n\ufb01scal\u00a0year.\n\nRegional and subregional averages or totals are provided for seven \n\ntables (A1, A2, A6, A11, A12, A13, and A14). For tables A1, A2, A6, and \nA14, the averages are computed using weights derived from gross \nnational income (GNI) in current US dollars following the World Bank \nAtlas method. The GNI data for 2011\u20132014 were obtained from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators online. Weights for 2014 \nwere carried over through 2017. The GNI data for the Cook\u00a0Islands \nwere estimated using the Atlas conversion factor. Myanmar and \nNauru have no GNI data. For tables A11 and A12, the regional and \n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002273\n\nsubregional averages were computed on the basis of a consistent sum, \nwhich\u00a0means that if there are missing country data for a given year, the \nsum of the prior year used for computing the growth rate excludes the \ncorresponding country data. Data for Myanmar and Nauru are excluded \nfrom the computation of all subregional averages and totals.\n\nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. These tables show related data on \noutput growth, production, and demand. Changes to the national income \naccounts series for some countries have been made to accommodate \na change in source, methodology, and/or base year. The series for \nAfghanistan, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan re\ufb02ect \ufb01scal year \ndata, rather than calendar year data, while those for Timor-Leste re\ufb02ect \nthe GDP excluding oil and United Nations inputs.\n\nTable A1: Growth rate of GDP (% per year). The table shows annual \n\ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, \nor basic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of the value \nadded of all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes \nless subsidies on imports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar \ntaxes. Constant factor cost measures differ from market price measures \nin that they exclude taxes on production and include subsidies. Basic \nprice valuation is the factor cost plus some taxes on production, such\u00a0as \nproperty and payroll taxes, and less some subsidies, such as labor-\nrelated subsidies but not product-related subsidies. Most economies \nuse constant market price valuation. Fiji, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka use \nconstant factor costs, while the Maldives and Nepal use basic prices. \nThe series for Taipei,China has been changed to accommodate its \nadoption of the chain-linking method.\n\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is de\ufb01ned as \nGDP at constant prices divided by the population. The series for most of \nthe Paci\ufb01c countries were revised to accommodate a change of source \nfor population data. Data on per capita gross national income in US \ndollar terms (Atlas method) for 2014 are also shown, sourced from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators online.\n\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (% per year). \n\nThe table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture at \nconstant prices and its corresponding share in 2014 at current prices. \nThe agriculture sector comprises agricultural crops, livestock, poultry, \n\ufb01sheries, and forestry. \n\nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year). The \n\ntable provides the growth rates of value added in industry at constant \nprices and its corresponding share in 2014 at current prices. This sector \ncomprises manufacturing, mining and quarrying, construction, and \nutilities. \n\nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (% per year). \n\nThe table gives the growth rates of value added in services at \nconstant prices and its corresponding share in 2014 at current prices. \nSubsectors generally include trade, banking, \ufb01nance, real estate, public \nadministration, and other services.\n\nTable A6: In\ufb02ation (% per year). Data on in\ufb02ation rates represent \nperiod averages. The in\ufb02ation rates presented are based on consumer \nprice indexes. The consumer price indexes of the following economies \n\n\f274\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nare for a given city or group of consumers only: Afghanistan is for \nKabul (until 2011), Cambodia is for Phnom Penh, the Marshall Islands \nis for Majuro, Solomon Islands is for Honiara, and Nepal is for urban \nconsumers.\n\nTable A7: Growth in money supply (% per year). This table tracks \n\nthe annual percentage change in the end-of-period supply of broad \nmoney as represented by M2 for most countries. M2 is de\ufb01ned as the \nsum of M1 and quasi-money, where M1 denotes currency in circulation \nplus demand deposits, and quasi-money consists of time and savings \ndeposits including foreign currency deposits.\n\nTables A8, A9, and A10: Government \ufb01nance. These tables give \nthe revenue and expenditure transactions and the \ufb01scal balance of \nthe central government expressed as a percentage of GDP in nominal \nterms. For Cambodia (since 2006), the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Tajikistan, \ntransactions are those reported by the general government.\n\nTable A8: Central government revenues (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment revenues comprise all nonrepayable receipts, both current \nand capital, plus grants. These amounts are computed as a percentage \nof GDP at current prices. For the Republic of Korea, revenues exclude \nsocial security contributions. For Singapore, revenues include the net \ninvestment returns contribution. For Kazakhstan, revenues include \ntransfers from the national fund. Grants are excluded in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand; revenues from \ndisinvestment are included for India; and only current revenues are \nincluded for Bangladesh.\n\nTable A9: Central government expenditures (% of GDP). Central \n\ngovernment expenditures comprise all nonrepayable payments to \nboth current and capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts \nare computed as a share of GDP at current prices. For Thailand, \nexpenditures refer to budgetary expenditures excluding externally \n\ufb01nanced expenditures and corresponding borrowing. Those for \nTajikistan include externally \ufb01nanced public investment programs. \nOne-time expenditures are excluded for Pakistan.\n\nTable A10: Fiscal balance of central government (% of GDP). Fiscal \n\nbalance is the difference between central government revenues and \nexpenditures. The difference is also computed as a share of GDP at \ncurrent prices. Data variations may arise from statistical discrepancies, \ne.g., balancing items for both central and local governments, and from \ndifferences in the concept used in the individual computations of \nrevenues and expenditures as compared with the calculation of the \n\ufb01scal balance. For Fiji, the \ufb01scal balance excludes total loan repayments. \nFor Thailand, the \ufb01scal balance is a cash balance composed of the \nbudgetary and nonbudgetary balances. Some off-budget accounts are \nincluded in the computation of the \ufb01scal balance for Turkmenistan.\n\nTables A11, A12, A13, and A14: Balance of payments. These tables \n\nshow selected international economic transactions of countries as \nrecorded in the balance of payments. These items cover annual \ufb02ows.\nTables A11 and A12: Growth rates of merchandise exports and \nimports (% per year). These tables show the annual growth rates of \nexports and imports of goods. Data are in million US dollars, primarily \n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002275\n\nobtained from the balance-of-payments accounts of each economy. \nExports are reported free on board. Import data are reported free on \nboard, except for the following economies, which value them on the \nbasis of cost, insurance, and freight: Afghanistan; Bhutan; Cambodia; \nHong Kong, China; India; the Lao PDR; Myanmar; the Philippines; \nSamoa; Singapore; Solomon Islands; and Thailand. \n\nTable A13: Trade balance ($ million). The trade balance is the \ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. \nFigures in this table are based on the exports and imports amounts used \nto generate tables A11 and A12. \n\nTable A14: Current account balance (% of GDP). The current \naccount balance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, \nnet trade in services and factor income, and net transfers. The values \nreported are divided by GDP at current prices in US dollars. In the case \nof Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, official transfers are excluded \nfrom the current account balance. \n\nTable A15: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average). \nAnnual average exchange rates are quoted as the local currencies per \nUS\u00a0dollar.\n\nTable A16: Gross international reserves ($ million). Gross \n\ninternational reserves are de\ufb01ned as the US dollar value of holdings of \nforeign exchange, special drawing rights, reserve position in the IMF, \nand gold at the end of a given period. For the Marshall Islands and \nTaipei,China, this heading refers to foreign exchange reserves only. In \nsome economies, the rubric is foreign assets and reserves of national \nmonetary authorities and national oil funds, i.e., foreign assets of the \nMaldives Monetary Authority, net foreign reserves of the State Bank \nof Pakistan, assets of the National Oil Fund of Azerbaijan, and official \nexternal assets of Kiribati. The data for India are as of 6 February 2015.\n\nTable A17: External debt outstanding ($ million). For most \neconomies, external debt outstanding, public and private, includes \nmedium- and long-term debt, short-term debt, and IMF credit. For \nCambodia, and the Lao PDR, only public external debt is reported. \nFor Azerbaijan, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand, the \ufb01gures for 2015 are \nas of the end of September.\n\nTable A18: Debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and services). \n\nThis table generally presents the total debt service payments of each \neconomy, which comprise principal repayments (excluding on short-\nterm debt) and interest payments on outstanding external debt, as a \npercentage of exports of goods and services. For Cambodia and the \nLao PDR, debt service refers to external public debt only.

Modest \nrecovery in Southeast Asia and sustained growth in India will partly offset continued moderation in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and associated spillover into neighboring economies. Risks to the growth outlook \ntilt to the downside: future US interest rate hikes that may intensify global financial volatility, a sharper-than-\nforecast growth slowdown in the People\u2019s Republic of China that would hurt regional exports and growth, \nemerging producer price deflation that may undermine growth in some economies, tepid prices for oil and \nother commodities, and El Ni\u00f1o.  \n\nThis edition highlights the need to invigorate developing Asia\u2019s potential growth, whose decline since its 2007 \npeak explains much of the region\u2019s growth slowdown since the global financial crisis. To ensure a healthy future \nfor potential growth, Asia must employ the full range of policy responses to augment labor supply, improve \nlabor productivity, enhance institutional quality, and maintain macroeconomic stability. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries \nreduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains \nhome to the majority of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping \nits developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and \ntechnical assistance.\n\n \n\nA\ns\ni\na\n\u2019\ns\nP\no\nt\ne\nn\nt\ni\na\n\nl\n \n\nG\nr\no\nw\nt\nh\n\n \n\nA\nS\nI\nA\nN\nD\nE\nV\nE\nL\nO\nP\nM\nE\nN\nT\nO\nU\nT\nL\nO\nO\nK\n2\n0\n1\n6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2016\n\nASIA\u2019S POTENTIAL GROWTH\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\nISBN 978-92-9257-385-0\f", "author_pages": ["ASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2016\n", "ASIA\u2019S POTENTIAL GROWTH\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n", "\u00a9 2016 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
