INTRODUCTION \n\nM. Regan \n\nAsia and the Pacific region has been the world\u2019s fastest growing regional economy for \nover  a  decade.  Increased  investment  in  economic  and  social  infrastructure  poses  \na  major  challenge  to  sustained  regional  growth  and  development,  as  well  as  to  \ngreater  engagement  between  national  economies.  Adequate  and  efficient  national \ninfrastructure  is  a  fundamental  requirement  of  a  well-functioning  and  high-growth \neconomy.  Infrastructure  provides  the  assets  and  services  that  facilitate  trade  and \nexchange  within  the  economy,  increase  output  capacity,  improve  productivity,  reduce \ncongestion,  and  lower  public  and  private  transaction  costs.  However,  governments \nglobally  are  struggling  to  maintain  the  rate  of  investment  necessary  to  meet  present \nand  future  needs,  creating  an  infrastructure  gap  or  future  funding  requirement \nestimated  at  around  $800  billion  annually  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  (Moore  and \nKerr  2014).  In  global  industrialized  economies,  infrastructure  investment  averages \naround  3.9%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  This  rate  is  higher  among  developed \nnations  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region\u201410.5%  in  Malaysia,  6.0%  in  Australia  and \nCanada,  5.0%  in  Japan  and  New  Zealand,  and  4.0%  in  the  Republic  of  Korea.  In \nindustrializing  countries,  demand  drivers,  such  as  population  growth  and  rapid \nurbanization,  are  driving  higher  levels  of  investment,  particularly  in  the  energy  sector \n(electricity,  oil,  and  gas),  roads,  ports,  rail  and  urban  transport,  water,  and  sanitation \nservices. As for Asia and the Pacific region, infrastructure investment is around 29.0% \nof GDP in Indonesia, 21.0% in Thailand, 19.0% in Viet Nam, 15.0% in the Philippines, \n8.5%  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  4.7%  in  India  (Chong  and  Poole  2013; \nMcKinsey  Global  Institute  2013;  Seneviratne  and  Sun  2013).  In  industrialized \neconomies,  the  average  age  of  infrastructure  capital  stock  is  older  than  it  is  in \nindustrializing  economies,  and  depreciation  accounts  for  around  half  of  all  new \ninvestment, nearly twice the rate in industrializing nations (Mackenzie 2013; Australian \nBureau of Statistics 2014).  \n\nGovernments  finance  most  infrastructure,  but  future  spending  is  subject  to  fiscal  \nand  public  debt  constraints  that  raise  concern  about  the  sustainability  of  present \nexpenditure  levels.  Future  spending  may  be  insufficient  to  make  significant  progress \ntoward  closing  the  infrastructure  gap  estimated  at  US$8.5tn  for  the  region  between \n2010  and  2020  (Bhattacharyay  2012).  The  region  was  also  affected  by  the  global \nfinancial  crisis  of  2008  and,  although the  impact was  not  as  severe  as first  expected, \nproject finance flows downturned in 2009, private bond financing in the region declined \nrapidly,  and  project  finance  supply  changed  due  to  the  withdrawal  of  European  and \nNorth  American  banks  and  greater  participation  from  regional  lenders.  However, \nchallenges  remain  and  the  changes  introduced  by  the  Basel  III  reforms  have  created \nfuture  impediments  for  long-term,  limited-recourse  bank  lending  for  infrastructure \nprojects in the region (Asian Bankers Association 2010). \n\nInfrastructure is a capital-intensive and highly networked asset class that forms a part \nof  complex  supply  chains.  Assets  are  generally  site-  and  use-specific,  involve  high \nsunk costs, and require extensive, advanced planning and long lead times. Since 2003, \ninnovations  in  design  and  construction,  technology,  and  efficient  management  have \nbecome  highly  important  to  investment  economics  and  are  challenging  traditional \nprocurement  practices.  In  addition  to  the  supply  problem,  governments  also  face  \nthe  challenge  of  encouraging  significant  private investment,  and  ensuring  the  delivery \nand  sustainable  management  of  infrastructure.  As  an  asset  class,  infrastructure  \nhas  several  distinctive  characteristics.  Infrastructure  returns  reveal  a  low  correlation  \nwith  other  asset  classes  and  leading  economic  variables  such  as  interest  rates, \ninvestment,  employment,  economic  growth,  and  exchange  rate  variables  (Regan \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\n2004). It also relies on the quality of public institutions and effective policy frameworks \nin matters such as the enforceability of contracts, and effective regulatory and foreign \ninvestment rules. \n\nGovernments  provide  the  majority  of  infrastructure  as  a  public  good,  with  most \ninvestment  over  the  past  decade  occurring  in  the  telecommunications,  energy,  and \ntransport  industries,  which  also  account  for  around  65%  of  future  investment \nrequirements in Asia and the Pacific region (Asian Development Bank [ADB] and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  Institute  2009).  Public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  account  for \naround 10% of investment and are mainly used for networked economic infrastructure. \nInfrastructure  assets  involve  high  sunk  costs,  are  capital  intensive,  and  form  part  of \ncomplex supply chains. In most cases, investments in telecommunications and energy \nrely  on  user-pay  tariffs  for  their  revenue  and  may  be  regulated  internally  and/or \nexternally  by  a  government  regulatory  agency. Investments  in  road  and rail  transport, \nsocial  infrastructure,  and  water  projects  derive  revenue  from  government  availability \npayments and/or user-pay regimes. The investment characteristics of this asset class, \nthe  maturity  of  national  institutions,  and  the  quality  of  macroeconomic  management \nsignificantly impact the way infrastructure is financed in Asia and the Pacific region. \n\nThis  paper  presents  a  status  report  examining  the  current  modalities,  strengths,  and \nweaknesses  of  infrastructure  financing  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region.  The  paper \nexamines  11  sources  of  infrastructure  finance  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  and  the \nfinance support mechanisms that underpin investment viability and enhance the credit \nproperties  of  public  projects  for  private  finance.  The  findings  are  designed  to  support \nthe development of future infrastructure policy in Asia and the Pacific region. \n\nMethods of Infrastructure Finance \n\nGlobal  infrastructure  finance  is  experiencing  a  transition  in  post-2008  market \nconditions,  with  the  return  of  project  finance  at  record  levels  in  2014,  stronger \ninvestment intention signals from fund managers and sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), \nrenewed  interest  in  alternative  financing  options,  and  the  evolution  of  the  PPP \nprocurement models with improved risk-sharing and credit enhancement options. This \npaper also examines the options for public procurement, which continues to account for \naround  70%  of  infrastructure  expenditures,  as  well  as  the  important  role  that \nmultilateral  development  banks  (MDBs)  play  in  supporting  capacity  building  in \ntransitional  countries  and  providing  loans,  grants,  and  noncommercial  insurance  to \nimprove the bankability of both public and private projects in the region.  \n\n2.  GOVERNMENT PROVISION \n\nGovernments  have  traditionally  provided  most  infrastructure  capital  from  consolidated \nrevenue,  and  services  are  made  available  to  the  community  as  a  public  good.  Since \nthe  late  1990s,  governments  have  adopted  a  variety  of  methods  to  help  meet  the  \ncost  of  new  infrastructure,  such  as  user-pay  and  asset-betterment  charges,  thereby \ncreating  a  new  class  of  quasi-public  goods  that  possess  some  elements  of \nexcludability.1 While  these  approaches  can  provide  additional  sources  of  capital,  user \ncharges may contribute very little toward the costs of operating urban transport, ports, \nwaste management, and recycling services. In low-income, industrializing countries, an \n                                                \n1   A  quasi-public  good  refers  to  a  government-provided  facility  or  service  that  places  some  limitation  on \nthe typical non-rivalry and non-excludability of pure public goods. Although street lighting, public roads, \nparks, and potable water are pure public goods, tolled roads, public transport fares, and electricity user \ncharges exclude their use by members of society unable to meet the cost. \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nadditional  problem  is  the  affordability  of  user  charges  and  the  additional  transaction \ncosts imposed on low-margin sectors such as agriculture, fishing, and forestry.  \n\nAs  a  general  rule,  governments  provide  around  50%  of  infrastructure,  government \nbusiness  enterprises  30%,  and  private  investment  around  20%  (although  significant \ndifferences  exist  between  countries)  (Chan  et  al.  2009).  Government  funding  mainly \ntargets  health  and  education,  transport,  and  utility  services,  reflecting  the  basic \ntransformation,  high \npriorities  of  developing  economies  experiencing \nurbanization  rates,  and  increasing  congestion  (PricewaterhouseCoopers  and  Oxford \nEconomics  2014:  11).  In  contrast,  private  investors  mostly  invest  in  the  energy, \nresources,  and transport  sectors, suggesting  that  private  participation  in  infrastructure \nhas  as  much  to  do  with  the  underlying  economics  of  the  asset  class  as  with  the \navailability of capital.  \n\nindustrial \n\nIn  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region,  governments  face  many  challenges  in  attempting  to \nmeet  the  demand  for  new  infrastructure  and  private  participation  in  infrastructure \nprovision, and management is a priority for most governments in the region as well as \nfor  multilateral  development  agencies  (Moore  and  Kerr  2014).  The  main  difficulty  is  \nthe  viability  gap  that  exists  between  new  greenfield  infrastructure  projects  and  the  \nneed for state-financed subsidies to support a high proportion of private investment. In \nmost  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region,  the  demand  for  new  and  replacement \ninfrastructure  exceeds  the  financial  capacity  of  most  governments,  especially  in \ndeveloping countries facing high transaction costs, inadequate port infrastructure, and \nthe need for upgraded transport infrastructure in cities and towns. Governments meet \nthe cost of new infrastructure in several ways.  \n\nReordering Budget Appropriations \n\nGeneral budget appropriations are the most common method used by governments to \nfinance  public  infrastructure.  Governments  may  reorder  appropriations  and  forward \nestimates  to  meet  current  investment  needs  (Chong  and  Poole  2013;  Productivity \nCommission  2014).  Public  investment  is  volatile,  and  mid-cycle  mini-budgets,  budget \nreview  by  parliamentary  expenditure  review  committees,  concern  about fiscal  deficits, \nand changes in government cause frequent funding cutbacks and delays. Vertical fiscal \nimbalance  may  also  contribute  to  volatility  in  jurisdictions  in  which  many  projects  are \ninitiated or managed by provincial and local government agencies. \n\nAccounting and reporting procedures as well as governance varies between countries, \nalthough most governments order public spending according to a 3- or 5-year plan or \nset  of  forward  estimates.  Budget  appropriations  are  mostly  funded  from  general \ntaxation  or  public  borrowings,  both  of  which  may  attract  varying  levels  of  deadweight \ncosts. The strengths of appropriations include greater transparency and accountability \nfor  government  fiscal  management,  while  a  disadvantage  thereof  is  the  absence  of \nmarket discipline in project selection and evaluation (Chan et al. 2009: 228). However, \nsudden changes in priorities create investment shocks that have been shown to lower \ncapital productivity and efficiency (International Monetary Fund 2015: 17). \n\nBy Raising Taxes \n\nConsolidated  revenue,  which  provides  the  basis  for  most  state  appropriations  to \ninfrastructure  spending,  may  take  the  form  of  (i)  an  economy-wide  increase  in  direct \nand  indirect  taxes,  (ii)  the  raising  of  a  tax  or  levy  confined  to  a  province  or  local \ngovernment area, (iii) the dedication of existing taxes to specific investment objectives \n(such  as  applying  fuel  taxes  to  road  construction  and  maintenance),  and  (iv)  the \nimposition  of  a  user  charge.  New  taxes  to  finance  infrastructure  has  several \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\ndisadvantages  for  an  economy.  First,  taxes  are  costly  to  collect  and  administer,  and \ncreate  induced  effects,  such  as  tax  avoidance  behaviors.  Taxes  also  carry  significant \ndeadweight costs in economic terms, which may exceed the net proceeds of new taxes \n(Regan  2009:  27).  Second,  increasing  taxes  has  been  shown  to  have  a  negative \nimpact  on  regional  savings  and  economic  growth,  may  distort  economic  decision-\nmaking, and creates perverse incentives (Chan et al. 2009: 53), although the extent of \nthis  depends  on  the  purpose  of  the  tax  and  whether  or  not  the  tax  is  applied  to \nconsumption  or  income  (Helms  1985).  Third,  the  discriminatory  taxation  of  specific \ncommunities  or  users  encounters  Pareto  optimality  problems  and  creates  several \nequity and welfare problems (Regan 2009: 26\u201327). \n\nPrivatization, Initial Public Offerings, and Capital Recycling  \nof Brownfield Assets \n\nIn the 1980s, the sale of stock in existing government business enterprises (GBEs), the \ndisposal of assets by trade sale, and the placement of initial public offerings (IPOs) on \na securities exchange were common practices in many nations in Asia and the Pacific \nregion.  The  first  cycle  of  privatizations  occurred  in  industrialized  economies  and \nincluded fully integrated going concerns (brownfield projects) with trading histories that \nwere  relatively  easy  to  sell  to  private  investors.  In  many  countries  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific region, early privatizations included state banks, airports, insurance companies, \ntelecommunications  services  companies,  railways,  ports,  and  energy  supply  chains \nincluding generation, transmission, and distribution assets (Megginson 2005: 14\u201321). A \nsecond cycle of privatizations based on trade sales and a small number of IPOs took \nplace  in  the  1990s,  particularly  in  industrializing  economies  in  South  Asia  and  East \nAsia. By 2001, privatizations had raised $1.5 trillion for governments globally, although \nreadily saleable assets were becoming much harder to find (Megginson 2005: 21\u201325).  \n\nA  third  cycle  of  privatization  or  asset  recycling  is  now  taking  place  whereby \ngovernments  enter  long-term  leases  or  sell  mature,  income-producing  infrastructure  \nto  finance  the  construction  of  new  assets.  These  assets  must  be  financially  viable  \nand  may  require  subsidies  or  other  forms  of  ongoing  support  during  the  early  years  \nof  operation.  Recycled  assets  include  toll  roads,  airports,  electricity  generators  and \ntransmission  companies,  defense  establishments,  ports,  and  commercial  property \nportfolios.  Unlike  the  enterprise  privatizations  that  preceded  it,  asset  recycling  is  \ninvestment  capital  (Government  of  \na  sustainable  means  of  raising  additional \nAustralia 2014). \n\nPublic Borrowings and Budget Deficits \n\nFiscal  deficits  and  public  debt  in  2008\u20132012  grew  significantly  as  countries  pursued \nexpansionary and liquidity-generating policies in response to the global financial crisis \nof  2007\u20132008.  The  fiscal  deficits  of  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  also \nincreased after 2008, with 2014 deficits greater than the average deficit for 2002\u20132007 \n(World  Bank  2014:  7).  The  need  for  fiscal  consolidation  to  rebuild  resilience  is  also \npressuring  regional  governments  to  lower  deficits  to  longer-term  benchmark  levels. \nHowever,  this  is  difficult  for  some  countries  in  South  Asia  and  Southeast  Asia \nattempting \nfiscal  sustainability \nconsiderations  (United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Research  Commission  for  Asia \nand the Pacific 2015: 20). Part of the problem for these countries can be addressed by \nwidening  the  tax  base  and  fiscal  deficit  ceilings  designed  to  restore  fiscal  deficits  to \nlong-term  levels.  Most  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  other  than  Australia, \nIndia,  and  Japan  possess  the  fiscal  headroom  to  adopt  a  development-oriented  \nfiscal position. \n\nto  balance  national  development  priorities  and \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nAlthough  public  debt  increased  in  industrialized  economies  during  2008\u20132014,  public \ndebt remained stable in East and Southeast Asia at 42% of GDP, slightly higher than \naverage debt levels during 2002\u20132007 (United Nations Economic and Social Research \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific 2015: 19). However, most economies in the region \nhave  experienced  sustained  growth  in  corporate  and  household  debt  since  2008, \nincreasing  their  vulnerability  to  higher  interest  rates  and  presenting  a  challenge  for \nfuture monetary policy management. \n\nPublic  debt  is  also  a  major  source  of  investment  and  may  take  the  form  of  general-\npurpose  public  borrowings,  overseas  development  assistance  (ODA)  loans,  and  the \nsale  of  conventional,  indexed,  or tax-advantaged  bonds.  Many  countries in  the region \noffer  tax  exemptions  to  resident  investors  for  public  bond  issues.  Public  debt  attracts \ndeadweight  costs,  induces  credit  rationing,  and  \u201ccrowds  out\u201d  private  debt,  placing \npressure  on  interest  rates  and  diverting  capital  away  from  higher  yielding  private \ninvestment  (Regan  2009:  31\u201332).  In  2014,  the  average  public  debt  of  many  regional \ncountries exceeded their 2007\u20132014 external debt average in GDP terms (International \nMonetary Fund 2014a, 2014b). While the increase in budget deficits and public debt in \nAsia and the Pacific region is modest compared to that in other regions, it does impact \nsovereign credit ratings in the long term and represents a limited option for government \ninfrastructure spending in the medium term. \n\nTax-Exempt Bonds \n\nTax-exempt bonds are interest-bearing, redeemable securities issued by governments \nfor specific national interest projects or general infrastructure purposes; they form part \nof  governments\u2019  capital  budgets  for  infrastructure  spending,  and  are  considered  a \ngovernment  liability  (Marlowe  2009;  Ang,  Bhansali,  and  Xing  2010).  In  the  United \nStates (US), bonds issued by local governments may be accorded federal tax-exempt \nstatus. Tax-exempt bonds are described in greater detail in section 3. \n\nRevenue Bonds \n\nGovernments  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  must  look  for  alternative  ways  to  finance \nnational infrastructure in most sectors, especially new \u201cbig ticket\u201d assets such as ports, \nnational highways, energy generation, waste management, airports, and rail transport. \nIn  constrained  fiscal  environments,  one  option  is  for  governments  to  issue  project-\nspecific  revenue  bonds.  Revenue  bonds  can  be  used  to  finance  publicly  or  privately \nmanaged  infrastructure  with  tranches  designed  to  meet  investors\u2019  currency,  maturity, \nand  interest  rate  risk  appetite.  Revenue  bonds  may  be  issued  on  a  limited  recourse \nbasis,  with  full  or  partial  government  guarantee  support,  by  a  government  business \nenterprise, a project special purpose vehicle, or private sponsor. Projects financed with \nbonds  may  be  listed  on  local  securities  exchanges,  or  bonds  may  be  listed  on  the \nhome  exchanges  of  the  Asian  bond  market.  Depending  on  the  country\u2019s  level  of \ncompliance  with  international  public  accounting  standards,  bonds  that  do  not  require \nfull or partial government redemption may not be included in the country\u2019s public-sector \nborrowing  limits.  However,  it  may  be  necessary  to  record  bonds  supported  by \ngovernment guarantees or  other forms  of support  on the government\u2019s  balance  sheet \nfor accounting purposes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nGovernment Business Enterprises \n\nGovernments  have  traditionally  used  GBEs  to  finance  infrastructure  investment  \nin  specific  sectors,  such  as  energy,  transport,  and  water  resources.  GBEs  are \nindependent  legal  entities  with  their  own  board  of  directors,  and  their  borrowings  are \nnot treated as public debt of the shareholding government. GBEs finance their activities \nwith  retained  earnings,  budget  appropriations  (usually  as  equity  or  payment  for \ncommunity  service  obligations),  and  borrowings.  These  entities  may  borrow  or  issue \nbonds in capital markets and access sovereign credit ratings for debt-raising activities. \nIn  many  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region,  GBEs  generally  spend  more  on \ninfrastructure than do national and subnational government agencies (Wihardja 2013). \nGBEs\u2019  obligations  may  be  fully  or  partially  guaranteed  by  the  government,  and \nTreasury Departments may borrow or issue bonds on behalf of their GBEs if this incurs \na lower cost of funds (Chan et al. 2009: 93\u201394).  \n\nThe  advantage  of  the  GBE  option  for  governments  is  the  opportunity  to  generate \nrevenue  from  user  charges,  professionally  implement  projects,  and  quarantine  \nGBE  debt  from  public-sector  borrowing  ceilings.  GBEs  may  address  market  failure  \nand  use  cross-subsidy  services  to  mitigate  specific  project  risks  without  state  support  \nin  the  form  of  guarantees,  subsidies,  and  viability  gap  funding  (VGF).  GBEs  may  \nalso  provide  better  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency  than  can  private \nfirms,  and  borrowings  may  be  off-balance  sheet  depending  on  the  governing \naccounting standards.  \n\nGBEs\u2019  weaknesses  include  mixed  social  and  economic  objectives,  weakened  lender \ndiscipline,  and  enterprise  vulnerability  to  government  intervention  from  time  to  time, \neither  in  the  appointment  of  managers,  the  withdrawal  of  accumulated  earnings  as \ndividends, or the substitution of debt for equity capital. Investments may be selected in \nresponse  to  short-term  government  priorities  rather  than  on  the  basis  of  project \nviability.  GBEs  do  not  possess  the  private  sector\u2019s  aversion  to  investing  in  high-risk, \nmarginal  projects  that  do  not  demonstrate  a  sound,  risk-adjusted  economic  rate  of \nreturn.  Studies  also  suggest  that  GBEs  are  generally  inefficient  due  to  overstaffing, \nhigh  levels  of  debt,  low  levels  of  innovation,  and  a  bureaucratic  management  style. \nGBEs  are  not  subject  to  the  stimulus  of  a  competitive  market  environment,  and  \nare  slow  to  adopt  new  and  alternative  technologies  (Megginson  2005).  As  captive \ngovernment agencies exposed to expedient government interventions and operating at \nlow levels of efficiency, GBEs may be an unsustainable option for financing long-term \ninfrastructure investment. \n\nThe global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 demonstrated the hazards of providing GBEs \nwith  indemnity  against  enterprise  failure,  poor  investment,  and  operational  decision-\nmaking. There is no incentive for GBE managers to perform financially or operationally \nat a standard higher than that agreed with government. Long-term studies suggest that \nGBEs  fail  to  earn  a  rate  of  return  that  exceeds  government  bond  yields,  suggesting \nboth  enterprise  inefficiency  and  often  competing  social  and  economic  objectives \n(Productivity Commission 2008). \n\n3.  BANK LOANS AND PROJECT FINANCE \n\nHistorically,  governments  have  provided  70%\u201380%  of  the  capital  required  to  finance \nglobal infrastructure investment; however, this position is changing with project finance, \ncorporate,  and  project  bonds  presently  accounting  for  a  much  greater  share  of \ninvestment  (Project  Finance  International  2015).  Recent  data  suggest  that  private \ncapital  now  provides  up  to  40%  of  infrastructure  investment  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nregion. 2 The  global  financial  crisis  and  subsequent  Basel  III  reforms  had  long-term \nimpacts  on  global  capital  markets,  such  that  long-term  project  finance  became  less \nattractive for banks. During 2007\u20132010, loan terms and leverage levels were reduced, \nand  risk  repricing  led  to  higher  spreads  and  more  onerous  lending  terms  (Reviglio \n2012;  Seijas  2013).  These  changes  did  little  to  soften  the  market  appetite  for  project \nfinance,  and  the  level  of  lending  held  up  well  during  2010\u20132014  (Australian  Trade \nCommission  2013;  Project  Finance  International  2015).  Banks  have  provided  most  \nof  the  global  project  finance  since  the  1960s,  and  syndicated  project  finance  remains \nthe  most  common  method  for  financing  private  infrastructure  investment  in  Asia  and \nthe  Pacific  region.  In  2014,  global  project  finance  lending  stood  at  $260  billion,  the \nhighest level in 10 years. In the same year, Asia and the Pacific region accounted for \n$72 billion  (27.7%)  of  the  global  market,  the  largest  share  among  global  regional \nmarkets  but  less  than  the  average  share  of  31.5%  over  the  previous  decade  (see \nTable 1).  During  2004\u20132014,  most  global  loans  were  for  power  (39.0%),  transport \n(24.0%),  oil  and  gas  (21.2%),  and  property-related  projects  (5.4%).  In  Asia  and  the \nPacific region, most lending was for power (34%), transport (23%), oil and gas (15%), \nand the telecommunications sector (6%) (Figure 1).  \n\nTable 1: Project Finance Globally and in Asia and the Pacific Region, 2004\u20132014 \n($ billion) \n\nYear \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\nGlobal \n\nAsia and the Pacific \n% \n\n145 \n\n36 \n24.8 \n\n166 \n\n25 \n15.0 \n\n210 \n\n39 \n18.5 \n\n247 \n\n45 \n18.2 \n\n250 \n\n71 \n28.4 \n\n147 \n\n57 \n38.8 \n\n228 \n\n99 \n43.4 \n\n214 \n\n92 \n43.0 \n\n199 \n\n92 \n46.2 \n\n204 \n\n64 \n31.4 \n\n260 \n\n72 \n27.7 \n\nSource: Author. Data sourced from Project Finance International (2015). \n\nBank lending for infrastructure generally takes the form of project finance, the features \nof  which  include  limited  recourse  security,  long  tenors,  a  greater  level  of  lender \ngovernance,  and  higher  leverage  than  conventional  corporate  finance  alternatives. \nProject  finance  relies  on  future  cash  flow  to  meet  debt  servicing  requirements,  and \nlenders  will  generally  exercise  a  higher  level  of  due  diligence  and  governance,  make \nwider use of credit ratings, and apply financial compliance standards for the loan term.3  \n\nBond finance accounts for around 20% of project finance transactions in Asia and the \nPacific  region,  although  volumes  dropped  to  10%  during  2008\u20132012.  This  decline  in \nthe use of bonds is attributed to the rating downgrade of the major default guarantors in \n2008\u20132009 and the repricing of bonds at underlying default risk, which, in many cases, \nwas at S&P\u2019s BBB- or lower rating level (Debelle 2008: 78\u201379).  \n\nSeveral  notable  characteristics  of  the  project  finance  market  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nregion  since  the  global  financial  crisis  include  the  rise  in  the  importance  of  regional \nbanks  and  the  tendency  for  a  greater  share  of  bank  lending  to  be  allocated  to  home \ncountry  projects  where  debt  is  mainly  priced  in  local  currency  (Project  Finance \nInternational  2015).  The  supply  gap  created  by  the  withdrawal  of  the  Royal  Bank  of \nScotland,  Credit  Agricole,  the  Bank  of  Ireland,  BNP  Paribas,  and  Banco  Santander \nfrom the market  in  Asia and  the  Pacific  region  was  met  by growth  in regional  lending \nand  the  acquisition  of  assets  and  operations  of  several  European  banks,  such  as \n                                                \n2   For example, in Australia, private debt and equity capital accounted for 58% of infrastructure investment \n\nin 2013, up from 33% in 1993 (Productivity Commission 2014). \n\n3   These  covenants  typically  include  loan-asset  value  and  debt-service  coverage  ratios,  cash-flow \ndistribution  priorities  and  compliance  with  requirements  for  sinking  funds,  debt-service  reserve,  and \ncash-flow distribution covenants. \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM.

Data sourced from Project Finance International (2004\u20132015). \n\nProject  finance  loans  are  mostly  used  to  finance  infrastructure  projects  for  which \nprivate  firms  provide  equity  capital,  management,  and  operations  and  maintenance. \nThese include economic infrastructure projects including energy generation, ports and \nairports,  destination  freight  rail  services,  and  toll  roads.  In  Australia,  the  Republic  of \nKorea, and Japan, project finance has also been applied to social infrastructure in the \nform  of  schools  and  universities,  hospitals,  and  public  buildings.  The  state  bears \nmarket  risk  for  social  infrastructure,  and  project  revenue  is  derived  from  state \navailability payments. \n\nThe Strengths of Bank Lending for Infrastructure  \n\nA characteristic of project finance is that lenders are more active in asset management \nand  performance  by  playing  an  important  governance  role  to  ensure  borrower \ncompliance with the loan terms, transaction contracts, and financial covenants applying \nover  the  life  of  the  loan.  Banks  also  play  an  important  facilitation  role  providing  over-\nthe-counter  risk management  instruments  to  hedge  borrower  exposure to  refinancing, \ncurrency,  and  interest  rate  risks.  Multilateral  agencies  also  provide  support  through \ngrants  for  early-stage  feasibility  studies,  environmental  impact  and  management \nstrategies, loans, and financial services, including political risk insurance.  \n\nMany project finance transactions in Asia and the Pacific region are delivered as PPPs, \nthus ensuring a high level of rigor in project selection, evaluation, and implementation. \nA recent survey of PPP policies in the region indicates that 19 economies in Asia and \nthe  Pacific  region  significantly  improved  the  effectiveness  of  their  PPP  policies  and \nsupporting institutions from 2011 to 2014 (Economist Intelligence Unit 2011, 2014). \n\nAn  advantage  of  bank  lending  as  a  source  of  project  finance  lending  is  that  it  is  well \nunderstood  by  institutions,  central  regional  governments  and  their  agencies,  and \nborrowers. Debt servicing requirements over the project\u2019s economic life are matched to \nproject cash flow  and the financial  economics  of  long-term  infrastructure  investments. \nProject  finance  is  a  major  source  of  infrastructure  provision  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nregion;  supply  increased  in  the  region  during  2008\u20132012  and  it  appears  that  finance \nwill remain available for bankable infrastructure projects. \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM.

Data sourced from Project Finance International (2004\u20132015). \n\n \n\nThe Weaknesses of Bank Lending for Infrastructure \n\nFollowing  the  global  financial  crises  of  2008,  Asia  Pacific  banks  have  assumed  a \ngreater role as providers of loans and project finance to the region. The disadvantage \nof bank lending is its inflexibility and limited scope for managing change. Loans cannot \nbe retired early or refinanced without penalty, few conversion options exist, and interest \nrates  may  be  linked  to  floating  rate  indicators  that,  without  hedging  in  place,  expose \nborrowers to interest rate risk over the term of the loan.  \n\nA  distinctive  characteristic  of  project  finance  is  long-term  tenors,  which  permit  a \nmatching of the project\u2019s investment characteristics, the term of the service agreement, \nand  the  project\u2019s  long-term  debt  servicing  requirements.  Short-term  finance  or  a \nreduction  in  project  finance  tenors  creates  uncertainty  and  refinancing  risk  for \nborrowers, particularly in times of rate volatility.  \n\nThe Challenges of Bank Lending for Infrastructure \n\nGlobal  capital  markets  are  unpredictable  and  subject  to  systematic  risk  and  the \ninfluence  of  global  externalities.  Many  lenders  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  favor \nlending to the domestic market in local currency, suggesting a financing gap for future \nregional  cross-border  transactions.  Sustainable  bank  lending  for  infrastructure  in  Asia \nand  the  Pacific  region faces  the  challenge  of  transaction flow.  Infrastructure  investors \nand  lenders  argue  that  a  regular  flow  of  bankable  transactions  permits  contractors  \nto  create  and  maintain  skilled  project  teams,  enhances  collaboration  with  local \nconsultants and contractors, and lowers bid costs (Preqin 2015a: 4). \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\n4.  BOND FINANCE \n\nM. Regan \n\nBonds  are  financial  instruments  issued  by  a  government  or  corporation  obliging  the \nissuer to  make  periodic interest  payments  and repay  principal  on maturity.  Bonds  are \nan  alternative  source  of  capital  to  intermediated  credit  and  equity  financing  (Hack  \nand  Close  2013).  Bonds  take  many  forms  and  are  widely  used  by  governments, \ncorporations,  and  project  sponsors  to  raise  capital  for  infrastructure  projects.  For \nexample, interest payments may be at fixed or floating rates, tranches of a single issue \nmay be issued in different currencies with different tenors, and interest payments may \nbe indexed or guaranteed by the issuer or a third party such as a government or bank.  \n\nAfter the  1997\u20131998  Asian financial  crisis,  a  corporate  bond market  was  viewed  as  a \npossible solution to the capital flow problems that had led to the currency devaluations \nand  economic  downturn  in  Asia  at  the  time.  Asian  bond  markets  experienced  strong \ngrowth  in  the  post-crisis  years,  due to  improvements  in the  regulatory framework  and \nclearing  and  settlement  facilities.  In  2015,  corporate  bond  issues  for  \u201cEmerging  Asia\u201d \n(excluding  Japan)  stood  at  $8.78  trillion  (around  61%  of  regional  GDP),  with  most \nissues in local currencies (ADB 2015).  \n\nInfrastructure  bonds  are  frequently  credit-rated  and,  leading  up  to  the  global  financial \ncrisis,  default  guarantors  (monoline  insurers)  insured  a  large  number  of  issues  and \nprovided  S&P\u2019s  AAA  grade  credit  guarantees  to  projects  with  underlying  ratings  of \nBBB-  or  lower  (Debelle  2008:  78\u201379).  This  practice  lowered  the  cost  of  debt  for \ninfrastructure bond issuers, and the rating downgrade that many insurers experienced \nafter 2008 effectively closed the bond market as a financing option. Bonds accounted \nfor around 20% of the project finance arranged in Asia and the Pacific region in 2014, \nhaving declined to less than 10% of the market in 2009\u20132010.  \n\nThe average tenor of bonds in Asia and the Pacific region is around 6 years, although \nlonger  maturities  are  available  in  some  regional  markets,  notably  the  Philippines, \nThailand,  and  Indonesia  (ADB  2015).  The  largest  bond  markets  in  the  region  are  the \nPRC;  the  Republic  of  Korea;  Hong  Kong,  China;  Malaysia;  and  Singapore  (Hack  and \nClose 2013). The majority of bonds in the region are rated investment grade with low \ncredit risk and low rates of default (Ehlers, Packer, and Remolona 2014). \n\n4.1  Tax-Exempt Bonds \n\nTax-exempt bonds are government-issued securities that offer investors a full or partial \nexemption  from  taxation  on  interest  receipts.  Tax-exempt  bonds  are  in  high  demand \nfrom  investors  paying  higher  marginal  rates  of  income  tax,  which  limits  their \nattractiveness  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries  and  suggests  that  a  capital-\nguaranteed or indexed bond would be a more attractive option for many investors. Tax-\npreferred  bonds  may  be  issued  by  central  government  agencies  or,  as  in  the  US,  by \nmunicipal  agencies  with  a  national  government  income  tax  exemption.  Depending  on \nthe  terms  of  the  issue,  bonds  may  be  traded  in  official  markets  or  informally  through \nintermediaries and secondary markets.  \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nTax-based  incentives  present  a  conundrum  for  governments. 4 A  deduction  from  tax \nliability is an explicit transfer payment from the state to private investors to be offset by \nthe  welfare  and  private  benefits  of  additional  public  goods.5 The  security  will  also  be \npriced lower than other state securities in the market, which may reflect the lower risk \nof  the  revenue  bonds  or  simply  that  buyers  recognize  the  bonds\u2019  real  post-tax  return \nand adjust prices for the tax benefit. The subsidy effect may be significant, with a 2009 \nUS study showing a reduction in borrowing costs for private corporations by 200 basis \npoints (2%) at a cost to revenue estimated in 2006 at around $27 billion per year (Ang, \nBhansali, and Xing 2010). More recent studies of capped deduction bonds indicate an \nimplicit subsidy of bondholder returns of $31 billion for 10-year bonds and $112 billion \nfor  30-year  bonds  (Scott  2012).  Tax-exempt  bonds  may  also  create  distortions  and \ninduce \u201ccrowding out\u201d effects in capital markets. \n\nA  number  of economies  in  Asia,  including  the  PRC  and  Malaysia,  grant an  automatic \nincome  tax  exemption  to  resident  holders  of  state-issued  bonds.  Other  countries, \nsubject  to  international  tax  treaties  and  free  trade  agreements,  grant  full  or  partial \nexemption  from  transaction  taxes,  including  capital  gains  and  withholding  taxes  for \nnon-residents. \n\n4.2  Revenue Bonds \n\nRevenue  bonds  are  debt  securities  issued  by  governments  to  meet  the  cost  of \ngreenfield  infrastructure,  or  issued  by  a  project\u2019s  private  sponsors  to  raise  investor \ncapital  on  either  a  project-by-project  or  portfolio  basis.  The  bonds  are  secured  over  \nthe  value  of  the  assets  and  the  contracts  being  financed.  Issuers  may  provide \nenhancements by offering part or all of the issue at a discount or as indexed securities, \nin which case there is a discount to the yield spread (or interest) paid to retail investors. \nIssuers of indexed bonds have an advantage because the security is generally priced \nlower than conventional bond issues in the market (Chan et al. 2009: 84).  \n\n4.3  Corporate Bonds \n\nCorporate bonds accounted for 13% of infrastructure finance globally; however, in Asia \nand  the  Pacific  region  it  only  accounted  for  4%  of  infrastructure  bond  issues.6 This  is \nsurprising  given  the  strong  growth  of  the  Asian  bond  market,  which  accounted  for \naround  61%  of  regional  GDP  in  November  2015.  This  may  be  due  to  the  issuing \ncorporation\u2019s  liability  to  redeem  bonds  in  the  event  of  project  default.  Of  the  regional \ninfrastructure  bonds  on  issue,  around  94%  are  of  investment  grade  credit  standing, \ncompared  to  75%  for  global  issues.  The  credit  standing  and  liquidity  of  infrastructure \nbonds  are  generally  more  stable  than  those  of  corporate  bonds  (Ehlers,  Packer,  and \nRemolona 2014: 72). \n\n \n\n                                                \n4   In the US, revenue bonds may be issued by subnational governments and guaranteed by the national \ngovernment,  which  also  carries  the  tax  revenue  reduction.  Such  arrangements  suggest  a  need  for \ncontrols on subnational government bond issues to minimize the impact of deadweight costs, as well as \nany impact on vertical fiscal imbalance. \n\n5   Abelson 2003: 404\u2013418; Hillman 2003: 131\u2013138. \n6   This  can  be  compared  with  North  America  (41%)  and  Europe  (21%)  (Ehlers,  Packer,  and  Remolona \n\n2014: 72). \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\n4.4  Asian Bond Markets \n\nM. Regan \n\nAsian  bond  markets  provide  an  opportunity  to  bridge  the  gap  between  high  domestic \nsavings  and  the  shortfall  in  infrastructure  capital  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region, \nalthough evidence suggests that this has not occurred on a significant scale. In 2013, \nthe Bank for International Settlements and 11 regional central banks created the Asian \nBond  Fund  to  invest  in  local  currency  bonds  across  eight  Asian  markets  (the  PRC, \nIndonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and \nViet  Nam),  and  to  foster  capital  market  liberalization,  growth,  and  the  harmonization  \nof  member  capital  markets.  In  2005,  a  second  fund  with  $2  billion  in  capital  was \nestablished  to  facilitate  long-term  local  currency  bond  issues  and  develop  supporting \nservices, including derivatives and repurchase agreement trading. \n\nIn  2005,  the  Association  of  South  East  Asian  Nations+3  and  ADB  created  the  Asian \nBond  Market  Initiative  to  support  and  integrate  regional  bond  markets  for  public  and \nprivate  bond  issues.  In December  2014,  bonds on  issue stood  at  $8.88 trillion  across \nnine  regional  markets\u2014the  PRC  (with  a  63%  market  share);  Hong  Kong,  China; \nIndonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and \nViet  Nam.  Government  bonds  accounted  for  61%  of  the  market,  and  nongovernment \nbonds accounted for 39%, an increase from 29% in 2007 (Zen and Regan 2014). \n\nFigure 2: Global Bond and Loan Project Finance, 2004\u20132014 \n\nSource: Project Finance International (2015). \n\n \n\nGovernment bonds accounted for most issues in the PRC, Indonesia, the Philippines, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam;  and  corporate  bonds  accounted  for  around  40%  or  more  of \nissues  in  Hong  Kong,  China;  the  Republic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  and  Singapore  (ADB \n2015:  10).  The  majority  of  government  bonds  (33.7%)  were  issued  with  tenors  of \n3 years  or  less;  19.8%  had  3\u20135  years,  24.6%  had  5\u201310  years,  and  21.8%  had \n10 years.  Tenors  were  longest  (10  years  or  more)  in  Indonesia  and  the  Philippines, \nwith most  other funds favoring tenors  of 5  years  or  less.  Corporate  bond  issues  were \nmostly issued with tenors of 3\u201310 years and 11% had 10-year tenors (ADB 2015). \n\nThe Asian Bond Fund and Asian Bond Market Initiative  were important developments \nfor  the  region  providing  liquidity,  diversification,  and  risk  dispersion  opportunities  \nfor  investors.  Although  regional  regulation  has  become  more  integrated,  most  local \ncurrency  bonds  are  held  by  a  small  number  of  domestic  institutional  investors,  which \nmay limit market liquidity.  \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nStrengths of Infrastructure Bonds \n\nAs  a  financial  security,  bonds  are  an  attractive  investment  for  passive  institutional \ninvestors,  may  be  credit-rated,  and  offer  investors  liquidity  and  diversification.  The \nsecurity  may  be  issued  in  a  number  of  configurations,  including  different  tenors, \ncurrencies,  and  security  options.  Bonds  may  be  fully  or  partially  guaranteed  by  the \nissuing institution, a bank, or government, and may be issued with an indexed payment \nstream,  a  convertibility  option,  or  discount.  Bonds  may  also  be  listed  on  securities \nexchanges  and  their  performance  measured  by  tracking  market  indexes.  A  recent \nstudy confirms that infrastructure bonds in the region generally have significantly better \ncredit  ratings  and  lower  default  risk  than  do  corporate  bonds  (Ehlers,  Packers  and \nRemolona  2014).  Bond  finance  provides  a  flexible  way  to  finance  long-term  projects \nand is well-matched to passive investor requirements for infrastructure finance. \n\nLimitations of Infrastructure Bonds \n\nInfrastructure  bonds  do  not  entail  the  active  lender  governance  of  project  finance \nwhereby  lenders  prescribe  and  then  monitor  performance  criteria  over  the  loan  \nterm.  Bond  investors  are  generally  passive,  have  little  technical  understanding  of \ninfrastructure,  and  possess  little  knowledge  of  the  project\u2019s  underlying  economics. \nAlthough  the  risk  of  infrastructure  bonds  is  no  more  complex  than  that  of  corporate \nbonds, the risks are different, consisting primarily of sovereign and political risk (Ehlers, \nPacker, and Remolona 2014).  \n\nHistorically, bonds play an important but not a dominant role in project finance. Investor \npreference for brownfield risk and investment grade credit standing suggests that listed \nbonds  may  have  a  limited  role  as  a  future  source  of  infrastructure  finance.  However, \nthese  characteristics  do  not  rule  out  unlisted  bonds  playing  a  greater  role  in  future \ninfrastructure  projects.  The  recent  entry  of  investment  funds  managed  by  investment \nbanks  specializing  in  infrastructure  is  expected  to  grow  the  unlisted  market  in  the  \nnext decade. \n\n5.  MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS  \n\nMDBs such as ADB and the World Bank play a critical role in facilitating infrastructure \ndevelopment in Asia and the Pacific region. The World Bank provided $25.2 billion and \nADB  provided  $7.5  billion  in  infrastructure  loans  in  2011  (Moore  and  Kerr  2014).  The \nservices  offered  by  MDBs  include  multi-currency  loans,  grants,  equity,  guarantees, \ntechnical assistance (TA) programs, and cofinancing activities in conjunction with other \nMDBs, multilateral development agencies, and public and private organizations.7 MDBs \nmay  lend  for  longer  tenors  and  at  lower  rates  than  do  private  banks  with  greater \nflexibility  in  designing  debt  servicing  requirements  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF] \n2014).  The  average  credit  rating  of  ADB\u2019s  loans  and  other  financial  exposures  is \ninvestment grade (ADB 2014). \n\nADB  also  provides  default  indemnities  through  its  Credit  Guarantee  and  Investment \nFacility  to  leverage  infrastructure  projects  to  lower  cost,  investment  grade  credit \nstanding.  MDBs  provide  aid  and  concessional  loans  to  low-income  and  developing \ncountries  (Chong  and  Poole  2013),  and  play  an  intermediation  role  by  bringing  other \nfinancing institutions to a transaction and arranging debt syndications and sponsorship, \nthe  provision  of  non-commercial  risk  insurance  (sovereign,  political,  and  currency  \n\n                                                \n7   ADB  loaned  $7.5  billion  to  infrastructure  in  2012,  around  64%  of  the  institution\u2019s  total  lending  (ADB \n\n2014; Moore and Kerr 2014). \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nnon-convertibility  risk),  and  the  management  of  donor  programs  such  as  the  ADF \n(Moore  and  Kerr  2014).  MDBs  also  provide  training  and  information  to  emerging \neconomies  through  technical  publications,  national  and  project  case  studies,  surveys, \nand  reports.  ADB  sponsors  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit\u2019s  Asian  Infrascope \n(Economist Intelligence Unit 2011, 2014), and publishes Key Indicators for Asia and the \nPacific annually (ADB 2016) and the Asian Bond Monitor quarterly (ADB 2015).  \n\nStrengths of Multilateral Development Bank Participation \n\nMDBs  are  a  major  facilitator  and  provider  of  infrastructure  finance  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific region, and have a sound understanding of the region\u2019s economic, political, and \nsocial  drivers,  as  well  as  the  capacity  to  support  projects  with  TA  and  financial  and \nnonfinancial  support  services.  MDBs  play  an  important  role  in  providing  flexible \nintermediate  lending  that  reduces  the  gap  that  often  exists  between  underlying \ninfrastructure  project  economics  and  a  bankable  transaction.  MDBs  also  provide \ngrants,  equity,  and  debt  on  concessional  terms,  and  may  act  as  an  intermediary  for \nprojects  in  low-income  Asian  countries  by  introducing  co-lenders  and  third  parties  to \nhelp finance projects.  \n\nLimitations of Multilateral Development Bank Participation \n\nMDBs  have  limited  resources  to  meet  the  region\u2019s  infrastructure  financing  needs, \nalthough the World Bank applies around 50% of its lending to infrastructure, and ADB \napplies  around  65%  (Moore  and  Kerr  2014).  In  March  2015,  the  Group  of  Twenty \nNations (G20) committed to increase ADB\u2019s capitalization by $100 billion, suggesting a \nstronger regional role for this institution in coming decades. \n\n6.  INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND AGENCIES \n\nInternational  development  agencies  (IDAs)  are  also  an  important  source  of  loans, \ngrants,  financial  services,  and  TA  for  infrastructure  projects  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nregion.  Loans  and  grants  from  MDBs  and  IDAs  are  often  needed  to  address  the \nviability  gap  that  exists  for  private  investment  in  many  infrastructure  projects  in \ndeveloping economies and in several industry sectors.8  \n\nIDA  support  for  infrastructure  may  take  the  form  of  official  development  assistance, \nwhich was drawn from around 40 national agencies, 31 nongovernment agencies, and \n26 international institutions in 2015. ODA generally takes the form of loans, grants, and \ntechnical  cooperation  agreements  for  training,  development  planning,  the  financing  \nof  study  teams  and  experts,  and  the  provision  of  equipment.  In  2013,  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency\u2019s  global  development  assistance  comprised  loan  \naid  (72%),  technical  cooperation  (17%),  and  grant  aid  (11%)  (Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  2014).  Loan  assistance  is  mostly  provided  as  long-term  loans  \nfor  development  at  rates  lower  than  those  offered  by  commercial  lenders.  In  Asia  \nand the Pacific region, ADB manages the ADF, which also provides low-interest loans \nand  grants  to  the  region\u2019s  low-income  economies.  In  2013,  the  ADF\u2019s  assets  were \n$21.00 billion,  of  which  $14.00  billion  was  financed  by  ADB  and  $6.64  billion  by \ncofinancing partners (ADB 2014). \n\n                                                \n8   Industry  sectors  such  as  water  resources,  public  transport,  roads,  and  road  maintenance  generally \nrequire that high levels of state subsidy or availability payment regimes be viable for private investors. \nViability  is  improved  through  low-interest  IDA  loans  and  grants,  which  may  lower  the  level  of  subsidy \nsupport or guarantees provided by national governments (Estache 2010; Wihardja 2013). \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nIDAs  also  provide  TA  to  regional  countries.  Infrastructure  is  a  capital-intensive  group  \nof  assets  requiring  long-term  planning  and  operating  as  part  of  networked  supply \nchains  in  non-competitive  market  conditions.  These  characteristics  assume  greater \nimportance  when  private  firms  in  the  form  of  build\u2013own\u2013transfer  and  PPP  contracts \nprovide  investment  and finance. Governments face the  challenge  of  ensuring that the \nagencies  commissioning  these  projects  have  the  technical,  financial,  and  commercial \nskills  necessary  to  negotiate  long-term  and  incomplete  contracts  with  experienced \ninternational  investors,  operators,  and  financiers.  IDAs  provide  TA  to  developing \nnations at a number of levels: project research, analysis, and studies; advisory services \nand  payment  for  consultants  to  assist  with  project  selection,  appraisal,  governance, \nand  finance;  and  capacity  building  in  the  line  agencies  of  national  and  subnational \ngovernments. \n\nInternational development assistance may take the form of loans through import\u2013export \nagencies  and  credit  enhancement  through  international  agencies  such  as  the  World \nBank\u2019s International  Finance  Corporation, International  Development  Association,  and \nMultilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.  \n\n7.  PENSION FUNDS \n\nGlobal pension funds are significant global investors with an estimated $64.0 trillion in \nassets,  of  which  $33.8  trillion  was  held  by  the  top  300  funds  in  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2014 Global Pension Asset Study, \nwith  funds  under  management  growing  at  an  annualized  rate  of  7.3%  during  \n2010\u20132014 (Towers Watson 2014). Sovereign and public funds accounted for 67% of \nassets  under  management,  private  corporate  funds  19%,  and  private  independent \nfunds 14%. Around 64% of funds are in countries in Asia and the Pacific region.9 \n\nDefined-benefit  superannuation  funds  account  for  over  70%  of  survey  assets  in  Asia \nand  the  Pacific  region.  This  is  important  because  defined-benefit  funds  permit  fund \nmanagers  to  invest  in  long-term  assets  without  the  pressure  of  quarterly  market \nperformance  indicators  and  the  need  to  maintain  higher  liquidity  ratios.  Accumulation \nfunds place greater emphasis on the fund manager\u2019s ability to trade securities actively \nand  maintain  a  competitive  yield  performance,  particularly  when  regulations  permit \nmembers to move their accounts freely between funds managers.  \n\nSignificant  differences  exist  in  the  asset  allocation  practices  of  fund  managers.  For \nexample, funds in Australia, Chile, and the United Kingdom (UK) typically hold 40% or \nmore  of  their  assets  in  equities,  while  the  PRC,  Denmark,  the  Netherlands,  and  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  hold 20%  or  less  of their  assets  in  equity (Mercer  2014) (Table  3). \nThe  OECD  study  found  that,  on  a  weighted  average  basis,  equities  accounted  for \n41.2%  of  assets,  bonds  44.9%,  and  cash  and  alternatives  13.9%.  Pension  fund \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  takes several forms:  direct  and  indirect  equity  investment, \ndebt,  and  through  the  agency  of  specialist  infrastructure  funds.  The  OECD  2014 \nAnnual  Survey  of  104  Large  Pension  Funds  estimated  an  average  allocation  to \ninfrastructure  of  around  1%  (Inderst  2014;  OECD  2014:  51). 10  In  contrast  to  the \ninternational norm, the infrastructure allocation of funds under management is around \n6%  in  Australia  and  5%  in  Canada  (Inderst  and  Della  Croce  2013).  Debt  instruments \n                                                \n9   US  (36%),  Japan  (13%),  Canada  (6%),  Australia  (3%),  the  Republic  of  Korea  (3%),  the  PRC  (1%), \nMalaysia (1%), and Singapore (1%) are among the funds controlling 90% of assets under management \n(Towers Watson 2014). \n\n10  Preqin (2015a) estimates the average allocation to infrastructure of over 600 global funds to be 3.3% of \n\nfunds under management. The allocation for all institutional investors is 4.4% (Preqin 2015b). \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nare believed to be a relatively insignificant medium for global pension fund investment \nin infrastructure \n\nStrengths of Pension Fund Lending \n\nAs a debt security, infrastructure investments are well matched to pension funds\u2019 long-\ndated  liability  curve  and  yield  preferences.  Infrastructure  debt  offers  above-average \nrisk-adjusted  returns  and  portfolio  diversification  attributed  to  low-return  correlations \nwith  equities,  direct  and  indirect  real  estate,  bonds,  and  leading  economic  indicators \n(short-  and  long-term  bond  rates,  incomes,  employment,  inflation  interest  rates, \nexchange  rates,  and  investment  levels)  (Peng  and  Newell  2007).  Infrastructure \nrevenue  streams  are  stable,  generally  indexed,  underpinned  by  long-term  service \ncontracts, and possess low price elasticity and the advantage of limited competition. \n\nTable 3: Pension Fund Asset Allocation by Country \n\n% \nEquities  Fixed Interest \n\n \nCountry \n\nAustralia \nCanada \nChile \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nDenmark \nHong Kong, China \nJapan \nRepublic of Korea \nNetherlands \nSwitzerland \nUnited Kingdom \nUnited States \n\nSource: Mercer 2014.  \n\n50 \n35 \n40 \n20 \n20 \n65 \n30 \n  5 \n20 \n35 \n40 \n45 \n\n25 \n40 \n45 \n80 \n65 \n35 \n50 \n95 \n70 \n45 \n45 \n40 \n\nProperty and Other \n25 \n25 \n15 \n  0 \n15 \n  0 \n20 \n  0 \n10 \n20 \n15 \n15 \n\nLimitations of Pension Fund Lending \n\nPension  funds  favor  debt  and  equity  participation  in  unlisted  infrastructure,  which \naccounts  for  56%  of  their  allocation  to  this  asset  class,  and  fund  managers  have \ndifficulty identifying robust investment and lending opportunities. Infrastructure lending \ncan also attract high transaction costs, while 33% of institutional investors note liquidity \nas a concern and 26% note performance (Preqin 2015b).  \n\nPension funds prefer brownfield projects and will not lend for construction. As passive \nlenders,  fund  managers  are  not  well  equipped  to  exercise  the  governance  generally \nrequired of lenders to this asset class. Pension funds in Canada, Australia, and the US \nprefer  mature  projects  with  stable  and  predictable  revenues.  Pension  funds  are  not \nsignificant  lenders  to  infrastructure  either  globally  or  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region, \nalthough  data  are  not  readily  available  for  portfolio  allocations  to  infrastructure  bonds \nand other debt securities with the fund\u2019s allocation to listed equities. \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nPension  fund  lending  to  infrastructure  is  essentially  passive  and  does  not  import  the \ntechnical  understanding  and  governance  introduced  by  project  financiers.  Pension \nfunds  and  institutional  investors  experience  difficulty  with  regulatory  and  political  risk \nassociated  with  these  projects,  and  are  expected  to  be  a  limited  source  of  future \ninfrastructure finance. \n\n8.  SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS \n\nSWFs  are  special-purpose  vehicles  created  by  governments  to  provide  financial \nsecurity and stability during periods of international economic uncertainty. Clark, Dixon, \nand  Ashby  (2013:  4)  view  SWFs  as  a  policy  instrument  and  explain  their  rise  as \nopportunities  for  states  to  identify  investment  platforms  away  from  traditional  capital \nmarkets.  \n\nAlthough they have existed since the late 1950s, SWFs came to global prominence in \nthe wake of the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis when the number of funds increased \nfrom 8 to 21, and they stabilized many nations in Asia and the Pacific region during the \n2007\u20132008 global financial crisis. In April 2015, SWFs controlled $7.1 trillion of assets \nin  diversified  portfolios  generally  allocated  to  interest-bearing  domestic  and  foreign \nsecurities,  equities,  real  estate,  and  alternative  investments,  which  generally  include \ninfrastructure  assets  (Table  4).  SWFs  are  now  contributing  to  the  reshaping  and \ndecentralization of global capital markets and fiscal architecture. \n\nTable 4: Sovereign Wealth Fund Ranking \n($ billion) \n\n \nGovernment Pension Fund \nUAE-Abu Dhabi Authority \nSaudi Arabian Monetary Authority \nChina Investment Corporation \nSafe Investment Company \nKuwait Investment Authority \nHong Kong Monetary Authority \nGIC Private Limited \nQatar Investment Authority \nNational Social Security Fund \nTemasek Holdings \nFuture Fund \nOther \nTotal \n\n \nNorway \nUAE \nSaudi Arabia \nPRC \nPRC \nKuwait \nHong Kong, China  \nSingapore \nQatar \nPRC \nSingapore \nAustralia \n \n \n\nAssets \n882 \n773 \n757 \n653 \n568 \n548 \n400 \n320 \n256 \n236 \n177 \n95 \n1,440 \n7,105 \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, UAE = United Arab Emirates.  \n\nSource: Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute 2015. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nStrengths and Limitations of Sovereign Wealth Funds Finance  \n\nSWFs  possess  the  capital  required  for  long-term  equity  and  debt  investment  in \ninfrastructure  as  an  asset  class.  Infrastructure  securities  generally  display  the \ninvestment characteristics favored by portfolio investors and, with few liabilities, SWFs \npossess  the  necessary flexibility  for  direct  participation  in  the  infrastructure sector.  As \nwith  pension  funds,  the  attraction  of  infrastructure  for  portfolio  investors  is  its  strong \ndiversification  characteristics,  with  studies  showing  a  low  correlation  with  other  \nasset  classes  and  stable  price\u2013return  performance  against  most  leading  economic \nvariables  (Peng  and  Newell  2007).  It  may  also  be  argued  that  funds  are  designed  \nto  support  the  national  interest  and  should  maintain  a  high  portfolio  allocation  to \ndomestic  infrastructure  projects,  although  any  discussion  of  a  portfolio  quota  for  a \nspecific asset class raises the question of conflicting objectives. That is to say, SWFs \npossess  a  financial  rather  than  a  development  purpose  requiring  high  liquidity  levels \nand a return commensurate with a given risk appetite. Minimum allocations to domestic \ninfrastructure will involve political intervention in the SWFs\u2019 decision-making processes, \nand  threatens  the  independence  of  fund  managers,  a  matter  widely  discussed  and \nrejected in 200820\u20132009 with regard to mandatory infrastructure investment levels for \npension funds (Regan 2009: 47\u201350). \n\nAs  portfolio  managers,  SWF  managers,  unlike  banks,  lack  the  retail  apparatus  to  \nissue or trade in bonds, annuities, or derivatives, or to exercise the lender\u2019s traditional \ncredit  assessment  and  governance  roles.  Lender  governance  is  particularly  important \nin  infrastructure  finance,  which  requires  lenders  to  design,  monitor,  and  enforce \ncovenants regulating borrowers\u2019 performance under loan agreements. Covenants may \ncover  cash  and  operational  management,  observance  of  debt\u2013security  ratios, \ncompliance with sinking fund requirements, and debt service coverage ratios. \n\nThese  constraints  limit  the  SWFs\u2019  capacity  to  serve  as  arm\u2019s-length  providers  of  debt \nfinance for domestic infrastructure projects, as suggested by the relatively low average \nallocation of 4.5%\u20134.8% to this asset class (S&P 2014: 4). \n\n9.  INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING \n\nIn  the  1990s,  one  method  of  raising  equity  capital  was  the  IPO  or  securitization  of \nprivatized  former  government  business  enterprises  and  listing  on  global  securities \nexchanges. Several recent privately financed infrastructure projects were securitized in \na  similar  manner  by  issuing  stapled  securities  in  multiple  entities,  one  of  which  will \n\u201cloan\u201d its share of the offer proceeds to another vehicle in the group. This device was \nused  for  four  motorways  in  Australia  (Hills  Motorway,  Eastlink,  Clem  7,  and  Airport \nLink) from 1997 to 2011, although in all cases total return performance was poor and \nthe  vehicles  were  subsequently  delisted  and  assets  sold.  Transactions  using  the  IPO \noption  have  occurred  in  countries  with  mature  capital  markets,  which  limits  the \nfeasibility  of  this  option  in  countries  with  less  well-endowed  capital  markets.  While  a \nlisted  vehicle  may  issue  stapled  securities,  bonds,  and  other  debt  instruments  on  a \nsecurities  exchange,  in  most  cases,  the  IPO  option  is  used  to  raise  equity  capital  for \nprivately financed infrastructure projects. \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nStrengths of the Initial Public Offerings Option \n\nIPOs provide an additional source of debt capital. Companies can raise equity and debt \nas stapled securities or may issue bonds on a securities exchange. Stapled securities \nprovide issuers with the opportunity to offer separate equity and equity securities within \na corporate group structure. Listed bonds bring liquidity and the issuer has the option of \nissuing  bonds  in  a  variety  of  coupon  and  tenor  configurations  to  reduce  most  project \nfinancing risks.  \n\nLimitations of the Initial Public Offerings Option  \n\nThe  market  for  listed  infrastructure  projects  is  limited  for  single-asset  infrastructure \nprojects.  Debt  finance  options  include  listed  bond  markets  in  which  infrastructure \nsecurities  have  demonstrated  robust  credit  and  performance  characteristics.  IPOs \nimply greenfield project risk, and market evidence in Canada and Australia indicates a \nhigh  failure  rate  as  recent  transactions  have  resulted  in  significant  loss  to  equity  and \nwrite-downs for lenders (Regan, Smith, and Love 2015). \n\nLow  institutional  support  is  another  limitation  of  the  IPO.  Portfolio  investors  will  favor \npre-commitment  or  sub-underwriting  participation  at  a  discount  to  the  issue  price  for \nstapled debt and equity securities, an option not available to smaller portfolio investors \nand  the  retail  market.  Given  the  dominant  position  of  institutional  investors  in  capital \nmarkets  throughout  the  region,  the  infrastructure  IPO  market  has  a  limited  pool  of \ninvestors to draw from compared with offerings for other sectors. \n\n10.  PUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS \n\nPPPs  came  into  wide  use  in  the  global  economy  in  the  early  2000s,  although  the \npractice of government concessions for the private delivery and management of public \ngoods  has  a  long  history  dating  back  to  the  Romans.  PPPs  are  long-term  contracts  \nfor  the  provision  and  management  of  infrastructure  services  whereby  a  private  firm \nprovides  capital,  constructs  the  required  assets,  and  carries  most  development  and \noperational  risks  over  the  contract  term.  The  private  firm  derives  sufficient  revenue  \nto  provide  a  reasonable  return  on  investment  either  through  user  charges  or  a \ngovernment availability payment, and debt is supported from cash flow with restrictions \non  payment  to  equity  during  the  project\u2019s  early  stages.  There  is  some  ring-fencing  \nof  construction  risk  with  a  short-term  construction  loan  refinanced  on  completion. \nHowever, market risk projects in which a private party relies entirely on user tariffs are \ndifficult  to  finance,  with  recent  transactional  evidence  suggesting  that  these  projects \nhave a high probability of failure (Regan, Smith, and Love 2015). \n\nPPPs are generally highly leveraged with bond issues or project finance. PPP service \ndelivery is regulated under the PPP contract and/or by an independent regulator, and \nassets  pass  to  the  state  at  the  contract\u2019s  conclusion.  For  availability  payment \ntransactions, lenders to recent projects have required that debt servicing be met from  \na  core  service  payment,  which  is  not  subject  to  performance  abatement.  These \nnegotiated  terms  and  \u201ctake  or  pay\u201d  contracts  effectively  substitute  sovereign  risk  for \noperator performance risk, significantly reducing risk for lenders. \n\nIn Asia and the Pacific region, PPPs are an important source of infrastructure finance \nand are widely used to deliver economic infrastructure including motorways and roads, \npower  stations,  ports  and  airports,  rail  infrastructure,  and  urban  transport  (Zen  and \nRegan  2014).  Most  PPPs  are  highly  leveraged  and  may  be  financed  with  project \nfinance  or  bonds.  PPPs  are  delivered  against  a  policy  framework  suggesting \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nconsistency  in  the  procurement  process.  PPPs  may  be  supported  with  credit \nenhancement, as demonstrated by the Phu My 3 gas-fired energy transaction finalized \nin 2003, the first PPP in Viet Nam. Phu My was a high-risk, limited-recourse, greenfield \nproject that  was  mitigated  with  sovereign  and  political  risk  insurance  designed for  the \ntransaction by ADB and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Cooper 2004).  \n\nPPPs  are  not  suitable  for  all  infrastructure  applications  and  deliver  their  best  returns \nwhen projects offer economies of scale, significant risk transfer including lifecycle cost \nand  operational  risk,  and  the  ability  to  be  financed  in  capital  markets.  PPPs  are  not \nsuitable for small, conventional projects given their high transaction cost, and must be \naffordable for governments if they require an availability payment, capital contributions, \nsubsidies, or guarantee support over the project\u2019s life.  \n\nStrengths of Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n\nPPPs  are  delivered  under  a  procurement  policy  that  brings  some  uniformity  to  the \nproject  selection,  bid,  and  implementation  process.  Project  finance  is  used  in  most \napplications,  although  bonds  account  for  around  12%  of  recent  transactions  (Project \nFinance  International  2015).  For  lenders,  an  important  aspect  of  PPPs  is  alternative \ndispute  resolution  mechanisms  for  the  speedy  resolution  of  problems  that  arise  over \nthe  life  of  the  contract. PPPs  experience  lower  failure  rates  than  do  projects financed \nwith  conventional  corporate  loans.  Evidence  since  the  mid-1990s  shows  that  PPPs \ndeliver  innovations  in  design  and  construction,  achieve  significant  risk  transfer  away \nfrom  governments,  and  deliver  better  services  more  sustainably  than  do  traditional \nprocurement methods (Infrastructure Partnerships Australia 2007). \n\nLimitations of Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n\nPPPs  deliver  the  best  value-for-money  outcomes  for  the  state  when  projects  offer \neconomies  of  scale  and  significant  risk  transfer  to  private  investors,  and  require \ninnovative  design  and  construction  solutions,  as  well  as  skilled  and  incentivized \nmanagement.  However,  private  participation  in  infrastructure  in  East  and  South  Asia \npeaked  in  2010  and  investment  flows  in  2014  had  declined  to  less  than  half  of  peak \nflows (World Bank 2017). PPPs involve long lead times and high transaction costs for \nall  parties,  and  must  be  capable  of  being  financed  in  capital  markets.  Debt  is  usually \nsyndicated,  and  sustainability  requires  a  strong  and  effective  governance  framework. \nPPPs are not suitable for projects under $50 million and, if financed with tenors of less \nthan 10 years, are vulnerable to refinancing risk. Another disadvantage of PPPs is the \nimplied lack of flexibility with incomplete contracts 20, 30, and 40 years in duration, and \ngovernments\u2019  capacity  to  manage  planning  and  change  over  such  long  operational \nperiods, in particular.  \n\n11.  SECURITIZATION \n\nThe  unitization  and/or  securitization  of  revenue  streams  from  mature  infrastructure \nassets  are  a  financing  option  for  government  agencies  and  private  investors.  The \ninvestment  characteristics  of  mature  infrastructure  assets  include  limited  competition, \nregulated  tariffs,  a  stable  and  frequently  indexed  revenue  stream,  low  variable  costs, \nhigh leverage for enhanced return to equity, and low demand elasticity. In mixed asset \nportfolios,  infrastructure  assets  are  an  option  for  portfolio  diversification  (Della  Croce \nand Gatti 2014).  \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nSecuritization has been used to finance credit-enhanced bonds issued to finance social \nand  economic  infrastructure  projects  in  sectors  such  as  waste  management,  hospital \nand  school  projects,  and  regulated  utilities  delivering  water,  electricity,  and  gas \nservices  (Dexia  2007).  In  2012,  the  Independent  Debt  Capital  Markets  Group  issued \nconsumer  price-indexed  notes  for  a  solar  power  project  based  in  the  UK,  and \ntransactions  in the resources  sector  have  been completed  in  the  Russian  Federation, \nEurope, and Asia and the Pacific region (Project Finance International 2015).  \n\nLimitations of the Securitization Option \n\nSecuritization  was  widely  used  for  homogenous  revenue  streams  such  as  mortgage \nand  credit  receivables  until  2007,  and  was  an  early  victim  of  the  financial  crises  that \nfollowed.  Securitization  is  an  opportunity  for  lenders  to  recycle  loans  to  a  wider \ninstitutional  investor  market.  However,  securitization  requires  a  mature  capital  market \nwith larger institutions that can package and guarantee security offers, and provide the \nintermediation  and  distribution  services  required.  Securitization  is  not  viewed  as  a \nmedium-term  option  by  leading  financial  institutions  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region \nwhere  bond  markets  offer  a  more  liquid  and  flexible  recycling  and  diversification \nalternative.  Securitization  is  limited  to  assets  with  high  credit  standing  in  a  stable \ninterest rate environment.  \n\nFinance Support Mechanisms \n\nFollowing  the  early  privatization  of  brownfield  projects  in the  mid-1990s,  infrastructure \nprojects in many sectors declined in credit quality. This is partly because privatizations \nand more bankable energy, port, transport, and airport projects have been replaced by \na  group  of  projects  in  such  sectors  as  water  supply  and  sanitation,  urban  transport, \nroads  and  road  maintenance,  and  railway  services,  many  of  which  are  in  regional \nareas. Project viability questions are far more common now than they were in the early \n2000s.  Governments  and  MDBs  have  responded  with  financial  support  designed  to \nimprove  the  credit  profile  and  bankability  of  infrastructure  projects.  Of  these  support \nfacilities,  many  of  which  are  discussed  above,  several  warrant  further  examination: \nVGF, the European Investment Bank (EIB) mezzanine bond finance program, and the \nstate as a lender of last resort.  \n\nViability Gap Funding \n\nInfrastructure may  not  be  viable  for private  investors  if the revenue  stream generated \nby  the  project  is  insufficient  to  service  the  level  of  debt  required  for  the  undertaking. \nThis  can  occur  when  user-pays  principles  generate  insufficient  revenue  to  meet  debt \nservicing obligations, when output pricing is subject to discretionary state regulation or \nprice  caps,  or  when  the  level  of  risk  allocated  to  the  private  party  is  unacceptable  to \nlenders. In response, governments worldwide have introduced VGF policies in place of \nad hoc project support negotiated on a case-by-case basis. \n\nVGF is state financial assistance for privately financed infrastructure projects to support \nbankability, and is being adopted either formally or informally in build\u2013own\u2013operate and \nPPP  contracting  modalities  throughout  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region.  VGF  is  used  to \nensure that a project designated for delivery as a privately financed project does not fail \ndue  to  its  marginal  viability.  VGF  effectively  internalizes  externalities  in  infrastructure \nmarkets  (Irwin  2006),  and  governments  use  VGF  if  some  form  of  assistance  is \nwarranted  to  reduce  project  costs,  ensure  timely  delivery,  or  provide  a  basis  for \nsustainable service delivery over long intervals (Regan 2009). VGF may take the form \nof  up-front  capital  contributions,  debt  provision,  payment  of  subsidies  during  the \noperational  stage  of  the  project,  and/or  guarantees  against  specific  transaction  risks. \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\nVGF is embodied in policy, which in many cases creates contribution \u201ccaps,\u201d requires \nthe  full  disbursement  of  private  equity  and  debt  before  payment  is  made,  and  directs \npayment  to  project  lenders  on  the  commissioning  of  the  project.  VGF  assistance  is \nnormally accounted for as a budget appropriation in the case of capital contributions, or \nas a contingent liability in the case of subsidies or guarantees. \n\nEuropean Investment Bank Mezzanine Bond Finance Project \n\nThe EIB mezzanine bond finance pilot project was introduced in 2010 to enhance credit \nfor senior bondholders of privately financed and qualifying infrastructure projects. The \nEIB provides S&P\u2019s AAA-rated subordinated mezzanine bonds or a guarantee to 20% \nof  the  senior  debt  to  meet  cost  overruns  during  construction  or  shortfalls  in  debt \nservicing  capacity  during  the  early  operational  term  of  an  infrastructure  project.  The \ngovernment  or  a  multilateral  development  agency  such  as  the  EIB  or  the  European \nCentral  Bank  provides  the  finance  or  guarantee.  The  mezzanine  bond  program \nreorders project risk and benefits senior lenders by improving their credit risk, lowering \nthe  project\u2019s  cost  of  capital,  and  permitting  higher  debt\u2013equity  ratios  (subject  to \nleverage limits) (EIB 2012).  \n\nLender of Last Resort \n\nIn the uncertainty that followed the global financial crisis, lenders reduced the level of \ndebt  that  they  were  willing  to  contribute  to  syndicated  project  finance  loans.  This  \nwas most evident in large-budget PPP projects in Canada and Australia, and required \nquick  policy  responses  on  the  part  of  the  government.  The  A$3.5  billion  Victorian \nDesalination Project was offered to the market at the peak of the 2009 crisis, and the \nGovernment of Victoria received bids from two consortia that both failed to raise the full \ndebt requirement. In response, the government quickly announced a successful bidder \nfor  the  final  negotiations,  and  pooled  lender  commitments  for  both  consortia.  The \ngovernment  stood  as  the  lender  of  last  resort,  and  relied  on  a  pre-commitment  to \npurchase a minimum quantity of water (the plant\u2019s base load) in an effort to reduce the \nproject\u2019s financial risk. The successful bidder was able to raise the full debt requirement \nfrom the market without recourse to state loans (EIB 2012).  \n\nThe  \u201clender  of  last  resort\u201d  mechanism,  with  the  state  providing  senior  debt,  imparts \nconfidence and provides greater certainty to both bid and capital markets. However, as \nwith  the  earlier  credit  guarantee  finance  programs  trialed  in  Australia  and  the  UK  in \n2008\u20132010,  state  financial  participation  limits  project  refinancing  and  leverage,  and \nincreases the  equity  or mezzanine  share  of  capital, thereby raising  the  cost  of capital \nfor the project (McKenzie 2008). \n\n12.  CONCLUSION \n\nGovernments  provide  the  majority  of  infrastructure  finance  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nregion,  with  the  assistance  of  multilateral  development  agencies.  While  continuing  to \nplan and provide most infrastructure in the medium term, national government sources \nalone may not be sufficient to bridge the infrastructure gap created by high economic \ngrowth,  urbanization,  and  rapid  industrialization  in  factor-driven  economies.  Since  the \nearly  2000s,  private  infrastructure  finance  has  assumed  a  more  important  role  in  the \nform  of  project  finance,  bonds,  and  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  and  PPP  procurement \nmethods. As well as serving as an additional source of capital, private management of \ninfrastructure also increases efficiency, improves productivity, and eliminates high-risk \nlifecycle costs for the state. However, private capital does have limitations, including a \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nM. Regan \n\npreference  for  projects  in  the  energy,  transport,  and  telecommunications  sectors  and \nan  aversion  to  market  risk  with  transport  projects.  Another  limitation  is  the  marginal \nbankability  of  many  infrastructure  transactions,  which  may  be  difficult  and  costly  to \nfinance  without  credit  support  from  the  state.  In  response,  multilateral  development \nagencies  have  increased  credit  enhancement  options,  and  VGF  policies  have  been \nintroduced, providing a systematic approach to improving the bankability of marginally \nviable transactions. In the region\u2019s mature PPP markets, this model has been modified \nto eliminate market risk for projects such as toll roads and rail projects, with availability \npayment  options \nlong-term  asset  and  service \nmanagement  contracts.  Future  innovation  and  development  of  the  PPP  procurement \nmodel  will  be  designed  to  allocate  risk  equitably  and  increase  the  attractiveness  and \nbankability of transactions to private finance. \n\nfor  asset  provision  stapled \n\nto \n\nPension funds and SWFs are not widely used to finance infrastructure projects, either \nglobally  or  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region;  however,  a  majority  of  funds  intend  to \nincrease  equity  participation  in  the  medium  term.  IDAs,  the  Asian  bond  market,  and \nspecialized  infrastructure  investment  funds  are  potential  sources  of  future  debt, \nalthough  passive  investment  is  not  always  optimal  for  limited-recourse  infrastructure \nprojects. Bond finance brings many attributes to infrastructure transactions but, unlike \nbank loans, lenders do not bring the same level of experience, market knowledge, and \ngovernance to the lending transaction.  \n\nBhattacharyay (2011, 2012) outlined the capital market policy objectives for the region, \nand these require little further explanation. Challenges faced by regional governments \ninclude  fiscal  repair,  mechanisms  for  the  recognition  and  funding  of  the  contingent \nliabilities  of  national  and  subnational  governments,  the  refinement  of  PPPs,  and  the \nintegration  of  policy  frameworks  with  a  view  to  adopt  common  policy  principles  to \nfacilitate  regional  connectivity  and  simplify  cross-border  transactions.  The  Association \nof South East Asian Nations has made considerable progress in this respect, and the \ntemplate can be applied more widely to Asia and the Pacific region. \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 721 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nM.

Regan \n", "Abstract \n \nAsia and the Pacific is the world\u2019s fastest growing regional economy, a position it has held \nfor  over  a  decade.  A  major  challenge  for  sustained  regional  growth  and  development  and \nensuring  greater  engagement  between  national  economies  is  increased  investment  in \neconomic and social infrastructure. The majority of infrastructure is provided by government \nas  a  quasi-public  good  but  governments  face  difficulties  meeting  future  demand.  Private \ninvestment provides an important option although investment has mainly taken place in the \ntelecommunications,  energy,  and  transport  industries.  The  objective  of  this  paper  is  to \npresent  a  status  report  about  the  methods,  strengths,  and  weaknesses  of  infrastructure \nfinancing  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  at  the  present  time.  It  adopts  a  positivist  perspective  and \nexamines  supply  and  demand  conditions  today  with  several  recommendations  for  future \npolicy development in Asia and the Pacific. \n \nKeywords: infrastructrure, financing, Asia and the Pacific \n \nJEL Classification: H54 \n \n", " \n"]}
