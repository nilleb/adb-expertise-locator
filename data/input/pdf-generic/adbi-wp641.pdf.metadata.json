INTRODUCTION \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nThe growth takeoff in Europe during the Industrial Revolution caused massive income \ndivergence between the present developed and underdeveloped countries. Per capita \nincome  of  the  Western  European  countries  rose  significantly  from  only  30%  above \nthose  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  India  at  the  beginning  of  the \nIndustrial Revolution to about 900% of that of the PRC and the other poor countries by \n1870  (Madison  1983,  Bairoch  1993).  Economic  growth  in  the  East  Asian  economies, \nhowever, took off only in the latter part of the 20th century, starting with Japan just after \nWorld War II, followed by the East Asian Tigers in the 1960s, the \u201ctiger cubs\u201d after that, \nand  most  recently  the  PRC  and  India.  The  6%\u201310%  sustained  economic  growth  rate \nduring  their  boom  period  reduced  the  disparity  between  the  West  and  the  East  (in \nterms of standards of living) and placed the newly industrialized economies of the past \namong the advanced economies of today.  \n\nThe  economic reforms  of the  1980s  have  transformed  the  PRC from  a  predominantly \nagrarian economy to an urban-based manufacturing growth hub. The PRC is now the \nsecond-largest economy of the world, having overtaken Germany in 1982 and Japan in \n1992  in  purchasing  power  parity  terms  (Madison  and  Wu  2008)  and  is  expected  to \nsoon  overtake  the  United  States  as  the  largest  economy  of  the  world.  Interestingly, \nIndia  has  also  experienced  high  and  stable  output  growth  over  the  last  2  decades, \nsurpassed only by the PRC and some of the East Asian economies.  \n\nThe  impressive  performance  of  the  Asian  economies  has  been  the  subject  of  a  large \nnumber and a great variety of studies, but most of them focus only on the sources of \nthis  unprecedented  economic growth. This  paper  seeks  to  explain  economic takeoffs, \nas  they  are  much  less  well  understood  than  the  long-term  elements  of  growth. \nTakeoffs, therefore, have remained rare in recent times, limited to a few Asian success \nstories while several countries still await their own takeoff miracle (Easterly 2006). The \nquestions  we  address  in  this  paper  are  as  follows:  how  best  to  define  takeoff  and \nlanding empirically? How and exactly when did the takeoff occur? Why did the takeoffs \noccur  when  they  did?  What  are  the  essential  features  of  the  political  economy  of \ntakeoffs?  Can  technological  stickiness  explain  the  relatively  constant  rate  of  growth  \nthat  the  Asian  catch-up  economies  experienced  in  the  decades  following  their  takeoff \nand  before  their  landing?  We  empirically  define  takeoffs  and  landing,  and  provide  an \noverlapping  generation  model  with  technological  change  and  skill  formation  to \nunderstand the political economy of takeoffs. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt \nhas been made so far to study the political economy of takeoffs and to characterize the \nconditions that lead to their takeoff into sustained economic growth. \n\nThe  political  economy  model  formalizes  the  idea  that  takeoffs  and  landing  are \ndetermined  by  forces  that  are  internal  to  the  economic  system  and  are  the  result  \nof  a  \u201cspontaneous  and  discontinuous  change\u201d  (Schumpeter  1911)  that  displaces  the \nequilibrium state previously existing. An irreversible technology upgrade that can put an \neconomy on a higher technology frontier is available, but at a cost that entails severe \nimpediments to technology adoption. It is this change in the production method in the \nform of a \u201ccreative destruction\u201d (Schumpeter 1942) that provides a sufficiently big push \nto escape the poverty trap (in the sense of a low-level equilibrium) and to take off into \nself-sustained growth.  \n\nOur  Neoclassical\u2013Schumpeterian  hybrid  growth  model  with  overlapping  generations \nand sticky technology is able to explain not only the high growth rates experienced by \nthe  Asian  miracles  for  decades,  but  also  provides  insights  into  the  political  economy \nunderlying  takeoffs  and  landing.  The  growth  pattern,  along  with  the  takeoffs  and \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nlanding  from  the  simulated  model  economy,  closely  approximates  those  from  the \nobserved data. The predictions of the model are rather optimistic as it re-enforces the \nimportance \nof  \na  low-level  equilibrium  trap  (Nelson  1956)  and  a  critical  minimum  effort  (Leibenstein \n1957) necessary to put a stagnant economy on a higher growth trajectory.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 generates an empirical \nrule  of  thumb  to  determine  when  each  of  the  Asian  miracles  took  off  and  landed  \n(in case they have already landed). In section 3, we make an attempt to model takeoffs \nas  \u201cradical  changes  in  the  methods  of  production\u201d  in  an  overlapping generation setup \nwith finitely lived individuals, followed by a detailed discussion of the political economy \nof takeoffs in section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper. \n\n2.  TAKEOFFS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH \n\nIn  the  1950s,  Western  Europe,  the  United  States,  and  the  \u201cEuropean  satellites\u201d \n(Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) produced more than 50% of the world economy, \nor  close  to  75%  if  the  regions  of  Eastern  Europe  and  the  former  Soviet  Union  \nare  included  in  the  definition  of  \u201cthe  West.\u201d  The  growth  experience  of  the  PRC  is \nparticularly interesting in this regard as the share of the PRC in world gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) increased from less than 5% in 1950 to 12% in 2004 and is expected to \ndominate  the  world  economy  soon  with  a  40%  share  (Frijters,  Dulleck,  and  Torgler \n2008).  Figure  1  shows  per  capita  GDP  for  selected  Asian  economies  over  time, \nrevealing  that  Japan  was the first  to  start growing, followed  by  the  East Asian Tigers, \nand finally the PRC and India. \n\nFigure 1: Per Capita Gross Domestic Product in Asian Economies over Time \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: Historical Statistics of the World Economy on Per Capita GDP, 1-2010 A.D. \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\n2.1  Defining Takeoff and Landing \n\nTo  help  us  identify  and  understand  the  incidence  of  takeoffs  among  the  Asian \neconomies, we begin by empirically defining takeoff and landing using a rule of thumb \nin  this  subsection  and  then  use  it  to  determine  exactly  when  these  countries  took  off \nand  landed.  A  country  is  said  to  have  taken  off  in  terms  of  economic  growth  if  it  has \neffectively  applied  radical  changes  to  its  available  resources  and  has  set  forth  on  a \npath of sustained economic growth extending for decades (Rostow 1960). \n\nEarlier papers in the literature on the identification of takeoffs have empirically defined \n\u201ctakeoff\u201d  as going from about  zero growth (between  \u20130.5%  and  0.5%) to  \u201cpermanent\u201d \nsustained  positive  (above  1.5%)  per  capita  growth  (Easterly  2006).  Out  of  the \nexperience  of  the  127  countries  examined  in  Easterly  (2006),  takeoffs  were  found  in \nonly nine of them (using both the baseline definition and the robustness checks). Both \nof these definitions used were not consistent and could not be used to identify all the \ntakeoffs  at  a  time.  According  to  another  paper  by  Aizenman  and  Spiegel  (2010),  a \ncountry  is  said  to  have  taken  off  if  real  per  capita  GDP  growth  exceeded  3%  for  5 \nconsecutive  years  within  10  years  of  the  potential  takeoff  from  the  stagnation  period, \nwhile  a  takeoff  ends  when  average  growth  falls  below  3%.  They  found  that  54.4%  of \nthe 241 stagnation episodes in their sample of 146 countries between 1950 and 2000 \nwere  followed  within  10  years  by  takeoffs,  with  46.4%  of  them  experiencing  relatively \n\u201csustained\u201d takeoffs. This paper therefore identified too many takeoffs, with an average \nduration of just 9.04 years, and can be considered a very general definition of takeoffs \nthat  fails  to  capture  the  real  essence  of  takeoffs  and  the  possibility  of  sustained \neconomic growth for decades. We believe that permanent takeoffs from poverty traps \nare indeed rare (Easterly 2006) and limited mostly to the Asian economies. The papers \nthat  have  attempted  to  identify  takeoffs  and  landing  empirically  so  far  have  chosen \nrules  of  thumb  that  have  resulted  in  either  inconsistency  (Easterly  2006)  or \noverdetermination  of  takeoffs  that  are  often  not  sustainable  (Aizenman  and  Spiegel \n2010).  The  definition  that  we  adopt  to  identify  takeoffs  in  this  paper  is  more  stringent \nbut close to that of Aizenman and Spiegel (2010). Instead of choosing this rule a priori, \nwe decided on an empirical rule that lacks the earlier deficiencies but could be used to \ncorrectly  identify  takeoffs  and  landing  that  resulted  in  sustained  economic  growth  as \nexperienced by the Asian economies.  \n\u201cTakeoff\u201d in this paper is defined as a higher growth rate than that of the United States1 \nconsecutively  for  5  years  at  a  stretch,  where  the  first  year  of  this  5-year  window  is \ntaken  to  be  the  takeoff  period.  Intensive  study  of  the  data  has  shown  that  most \ncountries that have managed to maintain growth rates higher than the United States for \n5 years at a stretch have set out on a sustained growth path lasting decades. Similarly, \nwe  define  a  country  to  have  landed  if  it  has  experienced  less  than  the  United  States \ngrowth  for  at  least  3  years  in  a  row  in  a  5-year  window,  with  the  first  year  of  slower \ngrowth than that of the United States in that window period marking the year of landing \nfor  the  country.  In  addition  to  the  usual  \u201ctakeoffs\u201d  and  \u201clanding\u201d  defined  so  far,  we \ndefine a country to have experienced a \u201ccrisis\u201d if it fails to sustain its growth phase for a \nfew years post-takeoff due to an imbalance in its socioeconomic, political, and financial \nsituations  (e.g.  recessions,  civil  wars,  and  Asian  financial  crisis)  before  resuming  the \ngrowth  again,  post-crisis.  We  also  define  a  country  to  have  experienced  a  \u201cfailed \n\n                                                \n1   We  have  used  the  United  States  as  a  benchmark  to  identify  the  takeoffs  and  landing  in  the  Asian \neconomies for a number of reasons. Firstly, it has grown at a constant rate of 2% on average between \n1900 and 2010. Secondly, data (in International Dollars) for the United States is available for every year \nwithout a break, and lastly, it has itself not taken off during this period. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\ntakeoff\u201d if it has experienced a takeoff but could not sustain the growth phase beyond a \nfew years and landed prematurely, without resuming growth again after the crisis. \n\n2.2  Identifying Takeoff and Landing Stage \n\nHaving defined takeoffs and landing in the last subsection, we use these definitions to \nidentify the year the country in question took off and landed, using per capita GDP data \nfrom the \u201cStatistics on World Population, GDP, and Per Capita GDP, 1-2010 AD\u201d2 (Bolt \nand  van  Zanden  2013),  measured  in  1990  International  Geary\u2013Khamis  dollars  (also \nreferred to as \u201cthe Maddison tables\u201d).  \n\nTable 1: Takeoffs and Landing for Asian Economies \n\nEconomy of Interest \nAfghanistan \nBangladesh \nCambodia** \nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of \nHong Kong, China** \nIndia \nIndonesia* \nJapan \nLao PDR* \nMalaysia* \nMongolia \nMyanmar** \nNepal \nDPRK  \nPakistan \nPhilippines \nSingapore* \nKorea, Rep. of   \nSri Lanka \nTaipei,China \nThailand \nViet Nam \n\nYear of Landing \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n1995 \n\u2013 \n \n1974 \n\u2013 \n1998 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n1998 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\nYear of Takeoff \n\u2013 \n2000 \n1999# \n1977 \n1960 \n1988 \n1986 \n1946 \n1991 \n1968 \n\u2013 \n1992# \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n2002 \n2001 \n1966 \n1966 \n1990 \n1963 \n1958 \n1990 \n\n4 \n \n\nDPRK = Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n\n* Faced economic and financial crisis. ** Faced civil wars and internal conflicts in between. \n\n# Second takeoff for Cambodia and Myanmar after first takeoff was disrupted in 1976 and 1974. \n\nSource:  Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison table. \n\nTable  1  reports  the  takeoffs  and  landing  (if  any)  for  the  South  Asian  and  Southeast \nAsian economies that have taken off post-1900s, followed by a brief discussion of the \ntakeoff, landing, and growth experience of Japan, the East Asian Tigers, the tiger cub \neconomies, the  PRC,  and  India. We  have  used  the  United  States  as  a  benchmark  to \nidentify the takeoffs and landings in the data, but the results of this paper are robust to \nthe  use  of  per  capita  GDP  of  the  United  Kingdom  or  the  12  Western  European \n\n                                                \n2   The  Maddison  table  used  in  this  paper  is  available  from  http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-\n\nproject/data.htm \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\ncountries 3  as  the  benchmark.  We  find  that  the  \u201ctakeoff\u201d  and  \u201clanding\u201d  definitions \nspecified  in  the  last  subsection  are  able  to  identify  the  incidence  of  takeoffs  and \nlandings  from  the  dataset  (as  experienced  by  the  Asian  economies),  starting  with \nJapan  as  early  as  1946,  followed  by  Hong  Kong,  China  (1960);  Taipei,China  (1963); \nSingapore  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  (1966);  the  PRC  (1977);  and  India  (1988).  We \nare  also  able  to  identify  the  specific  dates  of  takeoffs  for  the  tiger  cub  economies\u2014\nThailand  (1958),  Malaysia  (1968),  Indonesia  (1986),  the  Philippines  (2001)\u2014and  the \ncountries  often  referred  to  as  Indochina\u2014Viet  Nam  (1990),  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (1991),  Myanmar 4 (1992),  and  Cambodia  (1999).  Other  Asian \neconomies that took off but were not identified and have not received any attention so \nfar include Sri Lanka (1990), Bangladesh (2000), and Pakistan (2002).  \n\nFinally, we discuss the growth experience of (i) Japan, (ii) the East Asian Tigers, and \n(iii) the PRC and India, widely known for their unprecedented and extraordinary growth \nin the latter part of the 20th century. \n\n2.3  Japan\u2019s Economic Takeoff Post-World War II \n\nMost  of  the  advanced  economies,  particularly  in  the West,  took  off  well  before  1900, \nwith Japan being the only one among them to have taken off as late as the 1950s and \nacting  as  the  lead  goose  in  the  \u201cflying  geese  paradigm\u201d  (Akamatsu  1962),  used  to \ncharacterize  technological  development  in  Southeast  Asia.  Figure  2  presents  the  per \ncapita GDP growth rates  of  Japan  and the  United  States from  1920 to 2010.  Japan\u2019s \ntakeoff  in  1946  and  its  landing  in  1974  can  be clearly  distinguished  by  comparing  the \nGDP growth rates of these two countries. \n\nPer capita GDP growth rates, along with the average growth rates during three different \nphases  of  economic  growth\u2014(i)  pre-takeoff,  (i)  between  takeoff  and  landing  (also \nreferred  to  as  the  \u201cgrowth  phase\u201d),  and  (iii)  post-landing,  are  presented  in  Figure  3  \n(see also Table 3). Japan experienced an average annual growth rate of about 1.88% \nbetween  1871  and  1944  (excluding  1945) 5 and  2.02%  when  we  only  consider  the \nperiod from 1900 to 1944 (excluding 1945). Japan took off in the year 1946, soon after \nthe  end  of  World  War  II  and  landed  in  1974.  During  this  period,  Japan  grew  at  an \naverage  annual  rate  of  7.97%,  which  increased  Japan\u2019s  per  capita  GDP,  in  1990 \nInternational  Geary\u2013Khamis    dollars,  from  $1,444  in  1946  to  $11,434  in  1973  (an \neightfold increase). The per capita GDP growth rate increased almost fourfold between \nthe  period  before  the  takeoff  and  after  it,  thereafter  growing  at  about  1.80%  per  year \nbetween 1974 and 2010 (post-landing), which is close to the growth rate of the United \nStates during the same period. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n3   The per capita GDP of the 12 Western European countries reported in the Maddison tables has been \nused  as  a  robustness  check  to  ensure  the  results  are  not  driven  by  the  definitions  used  to  identify \ntakeoffs and landing. The 12 Western European countries include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, \nFrance, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. \n\n4   Myanmar first took off in 1974 and was disrupted by a crisis (civil war) between 1983 and 1991, but took \noff again in 1992. Similarly, Cambodia also landed prematurely due to internal conflicts before taking off \nagain for the second time in 1999. \n\n5   1945  is  excluded  from  our  discussion  as  it  is  considered  to  be  an  outlier  year  for  Japan,  which \nexperienced  a  tremendous  blow  to  its  economy  in  1945  due  to  nuclear  bombing  of  the  cities  of \nHiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States during World War II. \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nFigure 2: Takeoff and Landing in Japan\u2019s Economy \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, US = United States. \n\nSource: Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison table. \n\nFigure 3: Per Capita Gross Domestic Product Growth Rate of Japan\u2019s Economy \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison table. \n\n \n\n2.4  The East Asian Tigers \n\nEven though some of the East Asian Tigers who had extremely high growth rates in the \n1960s  are  today  counted  as  advanced  or  developed  economies  by  many  institutions \nsuch  as  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank  and  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development, we have grouped them separately under a \ndifferent  subsection  as  they  provide  an  interesting  case  study.  Their  growth \nperformance  (commonly  referred  to  as  \u201cthe  Asian  Miracle\u201d)  has  far  exceeded  the \nexperiences of virtually all comparable economies in the West. The East Asian Tigers \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\n(such as Hong Kong, China; Taipei,China; the Republic of Korea; and Singapore) have \ntransformed  themselves from technologically  backward  and relatively  poor  economies \ninto modern, affluent societies over the last 50 years, experiencing more than fourfold \nincreases in per capita GDP. We discuss the growth experience of Hong Kong, China \nas an example. Hong Kong, China took off in 1960 and landed in 1995, making it the \nfirst  \u201cAsian  tiger\u201d  economy  to  take  off  (due  to  export-oriented  policies  and  strong \ndevelopment strategies). Hong Kong, China grew at an annual average rate of 2.11% \nfrom 1914 to 1959 until it took off in 1960, thereafter growing at 5.73% per year from \n1960 to 1994. It finally landed in 1995, after which it has grown at an average annual \nrate of 2.57%.  \n\nThe  growth  experience  of  the  tiger  cub  economies  (Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines, and Thailand) is very similar to that of the East Asian Tigers. Even though \na clear takeoff can be identified from the growth path of each of these economies, their \ngrowth  were  relatively  unstable  as  they  were  hit  by  crises  such  as  the  East  Asian \nfinancial  crisis  (Indonesia)  and  the  economic  crisis  (Malaysia),  but  they  have  been \nsuccessful in sustaining high per capita GDP growth rates nonetheless. \n\n2.5  The People\u2019s Republic of China and India \n\nThe  PRC  and  India  have  been  at  the  center  of  many  discussions  over  the  last  2 \ndecades.  The  PRC  economic  miracle  has  been  a  classic  example  for  its  decades  of \nextraordinary high steady growth similar to that experienced by the East Asian Tigers \nbetween the 1960s and the 1990s. According to our definition, the PRC took off in 1977 \nand India in 1988, but both have not yet landed. Per capita GDP of the PRC increased \nfrom $894 in 1977 measured in 1990 International Geary\u2013Khamis dollars to $8,032 in \n2010. India\u2019s per capita GDP increased from $1,216 in 1988 to $3,372 in 2010. \n\nFigure 4: Takeoff and Landing in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Economy \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \n\nSource: Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison table. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nFigure 5: Per Capita Gross Domestic Product Growth Rate of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\u2019s Economy \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison table. \n\nFigure 6: Takeoff and Landing in India\u2019s Economy \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, US = United States. \n\nSource: Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison tables. \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nFigure 7: Per Capita Gross Domestic Product Growth Rate of India\u2019s Economy \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison table. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  per  capita  GDP  growth  rate  of  the  PRC  experienced  a  nearly  threefold  increase \n(post-economic  reforms)  from  an  average  of  2.68%  per  year  in  the  pre-reform  period \n(1951\u20131976) to a post-reform average of 6.88% per year (1977\u20132010). India, however, \ntook off only in 1988, growing at an average growth rate of 0.79% per year from 1885 \nto  1987,  thereafter  growing  at  4.91%  per  year  from  1988  to  2010  (post-economic \nliberalization). The per capita GDP growth rates for the PRC and India (compared with \nthe  United  States\u2019  growth  rate)  are  presented  in  Figures  4  and  6,  while  the  average \ngrowth  rates  during  the  pre-takeoff  and  post-takeoff  phases  are  detailed  in  Figures  5 \nand  7.  They  have  been  experiencing  periods  of  long-sustained  economic  growth \nextending for well over 2 decades now without any sign of tapering off over the years. \nTheir growth rates since takeoff have been not only extraordinarily high (\u201cpositive\u201d), but \nalso  stable,  and  their  economies  seem  able  to  better  withstand  unexpected  shocks \n(decline  in  volatility).  We  provide  a  regression  estimate  in  Table  2  to  show  that  the \npost-takeoff  and  pre-landing  average  growth  rates  among  the  growing  Asian \neconomies have been relatively stable, sustaining \u201cpositive\u201d growth over the years.  \n\nThe  distribution  of  the  per  capita  GDP  growth  rates  during  the  pre-takeoff  and  \npost-takeoff  periods  and  during  the  post-takeoff  and  post-landing  phases  in  Figure  8 \nsuggest  that there  has  been  significant  change  in  the growth  experience  of  the  Asian \neconomies  during  the  takeoff  phase,  with  growth  between  the  takeoff  and  landing \nphase  being  relatively  more  stable.  The  average  growth  rate  during  the  pre-takeoff \nphase was 1.43%, while it was 5.71% in the growth phase, and 2.45% post-landing.  \n\nEconomies in South Asia and Southeast Asia that do not seem to have taken off so far \nare Afghanistan, Mongolia, Nepal, and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The \nDemocratic  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Korea  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  0.85%  between \n1951 and 2008 (with growth rates being mostly negative or zero after 1974)\u2014the only \nnation  to  have  shrunk,  at  a  rate  of  \u20132.47%,  between  1975  and  2008.  On  the  other \nhand, between 1951 and 2008, Mongolia grew at an average rate of 1.50%, Nepal at \n1.47%, and Afghanistan at 0.75%. \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nFigure 8: Distribution of Average Growth Rates during the Pre-takeoff,  \nPost-takeoff, and Post-landing Phase \n\n \n\nSource: Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison table. \n\nTable 2: Stability of Per Capita Gross Domestic Product Growth during the \nGrowth Phase \n\n \n\nIndependent Variables \nYear \n\n \nConstant \n\n \nObservations \nR-squared \n\nJapan \n0.0003 \n(0.0006) \n0.0755*** \n(0.0094) \n28 \n0.010 \n\nPer Capita GDP Growth Rate \nPRC \n0.0015** \n(0.0006) \n0.0163 \n(0.0129) \n32 \n0.217 \n\nHong Kong, China \n\u20130.0005 \n(0.0006) \n0.0659*** \n(0.0147) \n35 \n0.015 \n\nIndia \n0.0021* \n(0.0012) \n0.0464*** \n(0.0149) \n21 \n0.101 \n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses \n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: Based on authors\u2019 own calculations using Angus Maddison table. \n\n \n\nA  striking feature  of the incidence  of  takeoffs  is  that  they  are rare  and geographically \nconcentrated  (Easterly  2006)  in  Asia,  among  countries  that  are  now  recognized  \nto  have  had  a  range  of  government  strategies  in  place,  from  extreme  laissez-faire  \nto  extensive  beneficial  interventions  (World  Bank  1993,  Stiglitz  1996).  Like  Japan, \ngovernments  in  the  other  Asian  economies  that  have  taken  off  have  played  a  major \nrole  in  maintaining  law  and  order,  expanding  schooling,  targeting  investments  in  the \nresearch and development (R&D) sector, and bringing about structural changes in the \neconomy\u2014such as economic reforms in the PRC and trade liberalization in India\u2014that \nwere  largely  successful.  The  government  policies  were  pro-growth  and  significantly \nhelped the economies take off into self-sustaining economic growth. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\n3.  THE THEORETICAL MODEL \n\nOnce  we  have  empirically  defined  and  identified  the  takeoffs,  we  model  takeoffs  as \n\u201cradical  changes  in  the  methods  of  production\u201d  in  this  section.  This  is  important  as, \nwhile  takeoff  is  important, the  determinants  of takeoffs  are far from  clear  and  warrant \nattention.  An  AK  type  production  function  that  lacks  diminishing  returns  could  have \nbeen  used  to  explain  the  stable  growth  experience  post  takeoff,  but  that  would  have \nimplied positive long-run per capita growth without any possibilities of a landing. This is \na substantial failing of the model as it does not explain \u201clanding,\u201d which is an empirical \nregularity among countries that have taken off.  \n\nIn a neoclassical model, on the other hand, there are declining growth rates along the \ntransition  due  to  the  existence  of  diminishing  returns  to  capital  (Solow  1956,  Swan \n1956)  and  it  would  have  been  impossible  to  sustain  per  capita  growth  just  by \naccumulating capital. There may, however, be constant returns to capital when capital \nis  broadly  defined  to  include  both  physical,  human,  and  knowledge  capital  similar  to \nLucas (1988) and Rebelo (1991), but none of these models are able to explain takeoffs \ninto sustained growth. The model that we set up in this section is able to explain both \ntakeoffs  and  the  annual  growth  rate  of  6%\u201310%  that  the  Asian  economies  have \nmaintained for decades. The basic features of the model are described as follows. \n\n3.1  The Basic Assumptions of the Model \n\nEach household in this economy is identical, and owns the inputs and assets (including \nthe firms), which transforms the inputs\u2014physical capital and knowledge capital\u2014in this \nneoclassical  growth  model  (Solow  1956;  Mankiw,  Romer,  and Weil  1992)  into  output. \nThe  economy  transforms  the  available  inputs  into  output  using  a  Cobb\u2013Douglas-type \nproduction function of the form \n\nY t\n( )\n\n=\n\n\u03b1\nK t KN t\n( )\n\n( ) ; 0\n\n\u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b2\n<\n\n,\n\n<  \n1\n\nthat  satisfies  the  usual  properties  of  a  neoclassical  production  function\u2014increasing, \nconcave,  and  twice  continuously  differentiable\u2014where  Y  denotes  the  level  of  output \n and a \nor gross domestic product of the economy, produced from physical capital \n at  time  t ,  a  result  of  the  labor \ncomposite  knowledge  capital  component, \naugmenting  technological  progress  undertaken  in  the  R&D  sector,  financed  by  the \n( )L t , the size of \ngovernment. Both sides of the production function in (1) are divided by \nthe  population  at  time  t  so  that  it  does  not  exhibit  any  \u201cscale  effects.\u201d  We  will \nhenceforth use lowercase letters to denote per capita variables in this paper: \n\nKN t\n( )\n\n( )K t\n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\ny t\n( )\n\n=\n\n\u03b1\nk t\n( )\n\nkn t\n( )\n\n\u03b2\n\n \n\nwhere  k  is the capital per worker and  kn  is the per capita knowledge capital.  \n\n1s< <  exogenously  set  in  this  model  is  saved \nA  constant  fraction  of  the  output,  s ,  0\nand  invested  (Solow  1956,  Basu  and  Weil  1998).  Each  unit  of  the  output  is \nhomogeneous, and equally productive irrespective of the time of its production and can \neither  be  consumed  or  invested  (either  in  physical  capital  or  in  innovation),  such  that \none  unit  of  output  devoted  to  investment  yields  exactly  one  unit  of  capital.  While \nsavings add to the existing stock of capital, old capital depreciates at an exogenously \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nfixed rate \u03b4. The evolution of physical capital over time is exactly the same as in the \nneoclassical model and is given by \n\n\u2022\nk t\n( )\n\n=\n\nsy t\n( )\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nn\n\n+\n\nk t\u03b4\n) ( )\n\n \n\nwhere the term  n \u03b4+  is the effective depreciation rate for capital per worker. \n\nWe  have  a  simplified  version  of  an  overlapping  generation  model  in  continuous  time \nwhere  agents  live  for  a  finite  interval  of  time,  which  presents  life  cycle  behavior  \nas  in  models  developed  by  Samuelson  (1958),  Diamond  (1965),  Cass  and  Yaari  \nt \u2208 \u221e . Individuals  \n(1967), and Blanchard (1985). Time is continuous and indexed by \n is  \nare  identical  in  every  respect  except  for  their  time  of  birth.  A  new  cohort \nl > ,  devotes  a  unit  \nt > ,  who  lives  for  a  finite  period  of  time, \nborn  at  each  instant \nof  labor  when  employed  in  the  labor  force  (there  is  no  labor\u2013leisure  choice  in  this \nmodel),  and  ultimately  dies.  Each  individual  lives  through  four  phases  (\u201cgenerations\u201d \nhenceforth),  where  each  generation  is T  years  long  with  the  oldest  generation  dying \nand  exiting  the  model  when  they  turn  4T .  The  four  generations  in  this  model  can  be \nreferred  to  as  the  (i)  youngest,  (ii)  middle,  (iii)  the  oldest  working,  and  (iv)  the  oldest \nnonworking generation. \n\n( )B t\n\n[0,\n\n0\n\n0\n\n)\n\nThe size of an individual cohort at any point in time is denoted by \nto grow at an exogenous rate of  n  \n\n( )B t\n\n and is assumed \n\nB t\n(\n\n\u03c4+\n)\n\n=\n\nB t e \u03c4\n( ) n\n\n \n\nOnly a part of the population from the first generation that had finished their compulsory \nlevel of education \u03b8 chosen by the government at time  t  enter the labor force at  t \u03b8+ . \nLet \u03c2 be  the  schoolgoing  age  of  the  individual,  which  could  also  be  chosen  by  the \ngovernment, but is assumed to be 0 in this model for simplicity. It is interesting to note \nhere that we have represented the time-dependent variables in such a way that we can \nsee  the  effect  of  the  government\u2019s  choice  of  education  today  on  the  outcomes  in  the \nfuture,  i.e.,  a  decision  made  today  at  time  t  will  affect  the  outcomes  only  when  the \nagents in question finish schooling and enter the labor force at  t \u03b8+ . So, there is a lag \nbetween the time of the decision regarding the state of the technology, the associated \nlevel  of  education  (to  be  discussed  in  much  detail  next),  and  the  time  it  affects  the \noutcome variables.  \n\nThe  total  population  at  any  point  in  time  includes  the  preexisting  individuals  plus  the \nnew born kids but not the people who die and leave the model economy. This can be \nrepresented as  \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\nL t\n(\n\n+\n\n\u03b8\n)\n\n=\n\nB t\n(\n\n+ \u2212\n\n\u03b8 \u03c4 \u03c4\n)\n\nd\n\n \n\n4\n\nT\n\n\u222b\n\n=\n\u03c4\n\n0\n\nwhere the population at  t \u03b8+  includes anyone born between  t \u03b8+  and \n (to be \nread backwards in the timeline). The total population also grows at the rate of  n , which \nis  the  same  as  the  cohort  growth  rate  because  of  the  net  influences  of  fertility  and \nmortality  (migration  is  not  included  here).  Even  though  four  generations  coexist  at  \nany  point  in  time,  the  labor  force  will  include  only  a  part  of  the  first  generation  and \ngenerations two and three (the middle and the oldest working generation in this model). \nThe  oldest  generation  (also  referred  to  as  the  fourth  generation),  include  individuals \n\nT\u03b8+ \u2212\n4\n\nt\n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nwho  have  turned  3T ,  are  retired  and  therefore  do  not  form  a  part  of  the  labor  force. \nSimilarly, the part of the first generation (the youngest group of individuals) who are still \nin school are also not included in the labor force. Labor force participation at time  t \u03b8+  \ncan then be denoted by \n\nLF t\n(\n\n+\n\n\u03b8\n)\n\n=\n\nB t\n(\n\n+ \u2212\n\n\u03b8 \u03c4 \u03c4\n)\n\nd\n\n \n\nT\n3\n\n\u222b\n\n\u03c4 \u03b8\n=\n\n(6) \n\nincluding  anyone  born  between  t  and \n.  Next,  we  discuss  the  structural \nchange  that  explains  the  takeoffs  and  landing  in  the  context  of  this  neoclassical  \ngrowth model. \n\nt\n\nT\u03b8+ \u2212\n3\n\n3.2  Structuring the \u201cTechnological Change\u201d \n\nGrowth  is  believed  to  have  been faster  among  latecomers,6 especially  the  East  Asian \neconomies,  as  they  had  access  to  the  advanced  technology  of  the  developed \neconomies  (Collins  and  Bosworth  1996),  which  they  imitated  or  borrowed  from  the \nearly starters (Gerschenkron 1962). Other papers that have modeled barriers to growth \nand traps are Basu and Weil (1998), Parente and Prescott (2005), and Benhabib and \nSpiegel  (2005).  Murphy,  Shleifer,  and  Vishny  (1989)  and  Banerjee  and  Newmann \n(1994)  also  set  out  a  model  of  poverty  trap,  while  Azariadis  and  Stachurski  (2004) \nprovided a survey of a number of theoretical models on poverty traps. In this paper, we \nmodel  it  as  a  \u201ctechnology  trap\u201d  similar  to  Azariadis  and  Drazen  (1990)  and  Basu  and \nWeil (1998), where every country has access to a traditional technology to begin with, \nand  has  the  option  to  upgrade  to  a  modern,  more  productive  technology  in  line  with \nthose used in the advanced economies. \n\n\u00b5\u03b5 \u00b5 \u00b5  \n{ , }\n\nwhere \n\n\u00b5\n\n>\n( ) 0,\nt\n\n>\n\u00b5 \u00b5\n\nand\n\n\u00b5\n\n\u2260  \n0\n\n\u00b5\n\n\u00b5\n\n\uf8f1\n= \uf8f2\n\u00b5\n\uf8f3\n\nthe traditional technology\n\nthe modern technology\n\n \n\nThis  irreversible  change  to  the  production  method  in  this  theoretical  model  takes  the \nform  of  \u201ccreative  destruction\u201d  (Schumpeter  1942),  which,  if  and  when  undertaken, \nprovides  a  push  sufficiently  big  to  escape  the  poverty  trap  and  to  take  off  into  \nself-sustained  economic growth. Technological  changes  broadly  defined in  this model \ncan  refer  to  (i)  direct  changes\u2014structural  or  institutional  changes,  stability  in  law  and \norder,  reforms  (social,  economic,  political  or  legal);  or  (ii)  indirect  technological \nchanges\u2014trade liberalization: leading to increased trade and foreign direct investment, \netc. While direct technological changes improve the productivity of every dollar spent in \nthe R&D sector, indirect changes facilitate imitation from new markets. \n\n                                                \n6   Due to \u201ccatching up,\u201d a process also referred to as \u201cleapfrogging.\u201d \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\n\u2022\n\u00b5\n[\nc\n\nt\n( ), ]\nt\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n= \uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n0\n\nc t\n( )\n\n\u2022\n\uf8f9\u2212\n\uf8ee\n\u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\nif \n\n>\n( ) 0\nt\n\n \n\n\u2022\n\u00b5\n\nif\n\n=\n( ) 0\nt\n\nHowever,  the  takeoff  into  self-sustained  growth  comes  at  a  cost\u2014to  adopt  the  new \nadvanced  technology,  the  country  has  to  incur  a  one-time  initial  setup  cost,  which  is \nassumed  to  be  sufficiently  large  to  make  the  incidence  of  takeoffs  so  \u201crare\u201d  in  the \nliterature. This setup cost can include psychological, political, and financial costs. The \ncountry,  however,  has  the  option  to  continue  with  the  use  of  the  primitive  technology \nwithout having to pay the setup cost, unless it is prepared to make the shift toward that \nnew  advanced  technology.

This provided a theoretical \njustification  for  the  role  of  government,  and  several  developing  countries  opted  for  \na  more  centrally  planned  mode  of  development  (Nelson  1956,  Leibenstein  1957, \nRosenstein\u2013Rodan 1961). Even in East Asia, governments have played a major role by \ninitiating  and  promoting  significant  pro-growth  policy  changes  that  led  to  persistent \ngrowth, economic reforms, and liberalization (Collins and Bosworth 1996).  \n\nEven  though economists  today  tend to favor free markets  or the  \u201cinvisible  hand\u201d  as a \nbetter economic system, we emphasize an important role for the government sector to \nplan  strategies  in  the  region  as  targeted  interventions  are  required  for  the  efficient \nfunctioning of the economy (more in a complementary role rather than as a substitute \nfor  the market  economy). This  can  lead  to  a  more  coordinated  approach (as required \nfor  takeoffs),  when  individual  economic  agents  are  unable  to  make  the  change \nthemselves.  The  importance  of  technology  adoption  was  emphasized  by  Schumpeter \n(1961),  and  Nelson  and Phelps  (1966),  who  connected  technology  lags  to  the growth \nperformance of the developing countries, while Benhabib and Spiegel (1994), Parente \nand  Prescott  (1994),  and  Segerstrom  (1999)  linked  human  capital  formation  and \ntechnology adoption to economic growth.  \n\nEndogenous  technical  progress  through  purposeful  activities  carried  out  in  the  R&D \nsector (particularly in universities or government research institutes) may also provide \nopportunities to escape the diminishing returns associated with investments in physical \ncapital. Takeoffs and sustained \u201cpositive\u201d economic growth in this model are driven by \ntechnological  change  in  the  R&D  sector  and  so  government  policies  can  influence \ntakeoffs  into  economic  growth  (Romer  1990,  Grossman  and  Helpman  1991,  Aghion \nand  Howitt  1992).  The  R&D  sector  in  this  model  has  an  AK  type  production  function \nsimilar to the one used by Jones (1995) and Aghion and Howitt (2007): \n\ni t\n( )\n\n\u00b5=\n\nt rd t\n( )\n\n( ).\n\n \n\n(7) \n\nThus,  the  intermediate  good \n (new  innovations  or  inventions\u2014new  patents, \ntrademarks, and blueprints) crucial in the formation of human capital is produced using \n devoted  to the  R&D  sector.  A \nthe  available  technology \nconstant  fraction \u03b7 of  the  income \n,  exogenously  set  in  this  model,  is  invested  in \nthe R&D sector, i.e., \n\n( )t\u00b5 ,  and  the resources \n( )y t\n\n. We can rewrite equation (7) as \n\ny t\u03b7=\n( )\n\nrd t\n( )\n\nrd t\n( )\n\ni t\n( )\n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\ni t\n( )\n\n\u03b7\u00b5=\n\nt y t\n( ) ( )\n\n \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\n(8) \n\nNew innovations are, therefore, a by-product of (i) the R&D expenditure (referred to as \nthe \u201cR&D effect\u201d) and (ii) the technology used in the R&D sector (the \u201cMu-effect\u201d), both \nof  which  ultimately  lead  to  more  inventions  or  greater  innovation.  However,  as  R&D  \nis  exogenously  set  in  this  model,  the  only  interesting  effect  on  the  R&D  sector  arises \nfrom  the  \u201cMu-effect.\u201d  The  R&D  technology  is,  therefore,  key  to  ensuring  long-term \ndevelopment of the economy. \n\n3.4  Dynamics of Skill Formation and Human Capital \n\nThe government in our model can affect the human capital and the growth rates in the \neconomy by investing in a new technology, and choosing the level of (formal) schooling \nto be imparted to the youngest generation through the education system, also referred \nto as the \u201ccompulsory level of education.\u201d The government does not only invest in the \naccumulation  of  knowledge  through  technology  adoption,  but  also  provides  for  its \nabsorption\u2014through channels like formal education gained while attending school, on-\nthe-job training, etc. Accumulation and absorption seems to play a complementary role \nin this regard. \n\nHuman  capital  of  a  typical  worker  is  a  result  of  the  skills  absorbed  through  schooling \nprovided by the education system. The quality-adjusted human capital of an individual, \nrepresented by \n is therefore the product of the cohort (referring to individuals born \ni t  (affected by the state \nin a particular period) specific discoveries in the R&D sector  ( )\nof the art technology) and the absorption capacity of the cohort \n\n( )a t : \n\n( )h t\n\nEducation  increases  the  absorption  capacity  and  can  be  represented  by  a  strictly \nincreasing function of the level of schooling attained: \n\nh t\n( )\n\n=\n\na t i t\n( ) ( )\n\n \n\n( )\na t\n\n=\n\n\u03c8 \u03b8\n\n( ( ))\nt\n\n=\n\n\u03c6\u03b8 \u03c8\u2032\n( );\nt\n\n>  \n0\n\n0\u03c6>  captures  the  conversion  rate  of  education  to  cohort-specific  absorption \nwhere \ncapacity in the economy.

There is an intergenerational knowledge effect in developing \ncountries,  which  is  nonexistent  in  developed  countries,  where  new  technology  quickly \nreplaces  outdated  technology  (through  on-the-job  training  to  update  skills).  In  other \nwords,  the  learning  of  skills  and  knowledge  through  formal  education  only  makes \ncomplete  replacement  of  the  old  technology  by  advanced  technology  a  slow  and \ngradual process, rather than rapid or instantaneous as in developed countries.  \n\nthe \n\nintergenerational  effect \n\nWe  model \nin  our  neoclassical  growth  model  by \ndisaggregating human capital by generations such that the generation-specific human \ncapital differs in skills owing mainly to their access to different levels of technology.

Based on the simulations from the calibrated model, we find that \nadoption  of  the  advanced  technology  helps  the  country  take  off  onto  a  self-sustained \npositive  growth  path.  The  model  economy  seems  to  experience  a  relatively  stable \ngrowth rate of 6.47% for a few decades after takeoff, before it lands and grows at a rate \nof 1.2% per year thereafter. The political economy model of takeoffs provides support \nin  favor  of  the  existence  of  a  technology  trap  in  poor  economies  and  calls  for \ncoordinated government interventions in terms of pro-growth policies. \n\n5.  CONCLUSION \n\nAfter  relatively  stable  stagnant  growth  rates  for  many  years,  a  number  of  Asian \neconomies  have  started  taking  off  into  periods  of  sustained  \u201cpositive\u201d  economic  \ngrowth,  reducing  the  gap  between  the  West  (developed  countries)  and  the  East \n(underdeveloped countries). While takeoffs are important, they are relatively rare, with \nthe  determinants  of  takeoffs  being  far  from  clear.  Thus,  this  is  a  matter  that  warrants \nattention as a number of countries are still waiting for an economic miracle.  \n\nWe  empirically  define  takeoffs  and  landing,  and  develop  an  overlapping  generation \nmodel  with  sticky  technology  to  understand  the  political  economy  of  takeoffs  in  the \ncontext  of  economic  growth.  This  definition  allows  us  to  successfully  and  consistently \nidentify  takeoffs,  landing,  and  periods  of  stable  economic  growth.  The  simple \ntheoretical model with technology adoption, and human capital accumulation is able to \nexplain the experience of the East Asian economies, which have managed to take off \nand  sustain  relatively  stable  rates  of  growth  for  decades.  Our  model  suggests  that \nmechanisms  that  could  trigger  such  a  growth  takeoff  may  include  structural  changes \nand technological adoption that comes only at a relatively high cost, and hence there is \na possibility that there exists a \u201ctechnology trap\u201d that seems to affect the timing and the \npossibility  of  an  economic  takeoff.  An  economy  may  therefore  be  stuck  in  a  \u201clow \ntechnology\u201d equilibrium even when \u201cbetter technology\u201d is available for adoption. \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 641 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nPakrashi and Frijters \n\nAdams,  F.

The \nhigh, sustained economic growth of these economies during their boom period reduced the \ndisparity between the West and these countries (in terms of standards of living). The source \nof such extraordinary growth has been a matter of great interest since then, but no attempt \nhas been made so far to model the political economy of takeoffs and landings in the context \nof  economic  growth.  We  empirically  define  takeoffs  and  landings,  and  provide  an \noverlapping  generation  model  with  technological  change  and  skill  formation  to  explain  the \nrelatively  stable  growth  rates  in  the  Asian  economies  for  decades.  The  existence  of  a \ntechnology  trap,  meaning  economies  cannot  afford  available  advanced  technology,  may \nexplain  why  takeoffs  are  relatively  rare,  even  when  many  underdeveloped  economies  are \nstill waiting for their own growth miracle. \n \nJEL Classification: O31, O43, O57 \n \n", " \n"]}
