This  paper  uses  a \ncomputable general equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze the possible poverty and distributional \neffects of the removal of the QR and the reduction in tariffs on rice imports. Policy experiments \nindicate that while market reforms in rice lead to a reduction in the overall headcount poverty index, \nboth the poverty gap and the squared poverty gap indices increase. The Gini coefficient rises as well. \nIn general, these results imply that the poorest of the poor are adversely affected.  \nIn particular, while market reforms in rice bring about a reduction in consumer prices \nthat is favorable to all, imports of rice surge and generate displacement effects on poor households \nthat rely heavily on agriculture for factor incomes, particularly on palay rice production and other \nrelated activities. Palay production and its output price decline. This translates to lower demand for \nfactor inputs in the sector, lower factor prices in agriculture, and lower factor incomes for these \nhouseholds. Thus, poverty in these groups, as well as  general income inequality, deteriorates. \nHowever, the results of the experiments involving various poverty-offsetting measures indicate that \nan increase in direct government transfers to these household groups can provide a better safety net. \n \n  III", "  IV", "TABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n \nAbout the Author  II \nAbstract  III \nTable of Contents  V \n \n1.

Introduction \nThe Philippines is one of the three countries granted exemption in 1995 from the \nremoval of quantitative restrictions (QR) on rice under Annex 5 of the World Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  agreement.  Japan  and  South  Korea  are  the  other  two.  The \nexemption will expire on December 31, 2004. The primary objective of this paper is to \nexamine the possible poverty and distributional effects of the removal of the QR and the \nreduction in tariffs on rice imports. In particular, it attempts to analyze the following \nissues: (a) Do the poor share in the potential gains from a freer market for rice? (b) \nWhat alternative or accompanying policy measures may be needed to ensure a more \nequitable distribution of the potential gains from a more liberalized market for rice? (c) \nWhat is the transmission mechanism through which the removal of the control may \naffect  the  poor?  These  are  critical  issues  that  the  government  must  address  as  it \nimplements market reform and opens the economy to imported rice. \n \nRice is the staple food for about 80 percent of Filipinos, and is therefore a \nmajor item in the consumption basket of consumers. It is the single most important \nagricultural crop in the Philippines, and is therefore a major source of income for \nmillions of Filipino farmers. Because of its political significance, the government is \nheavily involved both in its supply and distribution to assure consumers a sufficient and \nstable supply at low prices and to maintain a reasonable return to rice farmers with \nadequate price incentives. One major policy instrument of the government at present is \nthe control on imported rice through the QR. \n \nMarket reform in general and the removal of the QR on rice in particular could \nhave economy-wide effects. In this regard, it is appropriate to analyze these issues using \na computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated to an input-output table and \nnational accounts data. On the other hand, it is appropriate to study the effects of \nreforms on poverty and income distribution using individual household data to capture \nthe  heterogeneity  of  households.  This  paper  integrates  these  two  approaches.  In \nparticular, it specifies and calibrates an agriculture-focused CGE model to a set of actual \ndata  and  simulates  the  effects  of  the  removal  of  the  QR  on  consumer  prices  and \nhousehold income, and applies these results to a set of individual household data in the \nFamily Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) to compute the poverty and income \ndistribution effects. \n                                                 \n\u2020 This paper was written while the author was a Visiting Researcher at the Asian Development Bank \nInstitute from December 2003 to May 2004. Support from the Institute and the comments of John Weiss \non the earlier versions of the paper are gratefully acknowledged. However, the author is responsible for \nremaining errors and gaps in the analysis. \n  1    ", "A number of studies in the Philippines have looked at policy issues concerning \nrice,  but  the  methodology  applied  is  mostly  partial  equilibrium  analysis.  Partial \nequilibrium analysis however underestimates the possible effects of the reforms because \nrice, being a major agricultural crop, has many direct and indirect linkages with the rest \nof the economy. Furthermore, most of the empirical work done does not extend the \nanalysis to look at the impact on poverty. While existing literature provides estimates of \nchanges in consumer and producer surpluses, as well as the Gini coefficient, it does not \nprovide insights on the effects on poverty and on the depth of poverty. This paper \naddresses this methodological gap in the literature. \n \nIn the CGE literature there are two broad approaches to integrating a CGE \nmodel with national household surveys to analyze poverty and distributional issues. One \nis through microsimulation wherein the household categories in the model are the same \nas the household categories in the national household survey. As such, this approach \nallows for the heterogeneity of individual households during the numerical computation \nof the equilibrium of the model. The papers of Cogneau and Robillard (2000), Cockburn \n(2001), and Cororaton and Cockburn (2004) employ this approach.  \n \nThe other approach is a more recursive one. For a given policy shock, a CGE \nmodel with representative households is used to estimate the change in the average \nincome for each household category and the change in prices. These changes are then \napplied to an assumed income distribution of each household category (either lognormal \nor beta distribution) to conduct poverty and distributional analyses. The variance and \nother  parameters  of  the  distribution  are  estimated  using  data  from  the  national \nhousehold survey and are assumed fixed in the analyses, while the first moment of the \ndistribution is altered using the results from the CGE model. The papers of De Janvry, \nSadoulet and Fargeix (1991) and Decaluwe, Dumot, and Savard (1999) and Decaluwe, \nParty, Savard, and Thorbecke (2000) employ this approach. The present paper applies \nthis second approach, but uses the actual income distribution from the 1994 FIES. \n \nThe paper is organized in seven sections. The second discusses the government \npolicies in the rice sector and the production structure of the sector, including prices. \nThe third looks at current issues of food and poverty. The fourth discusses in detail the \nmodel used in the analysis, including the parameters, the elasticities and the model \nstructure at the base. The fifth gives a description of the poverty and distribution \nmeasures  used  in  the  analysis.  The  sixth  outlines  the  various  policy  experiments \nconducted and discusses the results. The final section summarizes the results of the \nexperiments and draws insights for policy. \n2.  The Rice Sector \n2.1. Rice Policy \nBecause of the political significance of rice, the government is heavily involved both in \nits supply and distribution to assure consumers a sufficient and stable supply at low \nprices and to maintain reasonable return to rice farmers with adequate price incentives. \nFigure  1  presents  a  broad  diagram  of  how  government  interventions  may  have \n  2    ", "influenced activities in rice. Three major components affect the supply of rice: local \nproduction,  buffer  stock,  and  imports.  On  the  other  hand,  three  factors  affect  the \ndemand side: domestic market, buffer stock and exports.  \n \nThe  present  pricing  policy  of  the  government  involves  the  setting  and \ndefending of price floor and ceiling. It also minimizes seasonal price variations in the \nvarious  regions.  Furthermore,  the  government  monopolizes  the  importation  and \nexportation of rice through its various procurement and disbursement operations in \norder  to  influence  domestic  price  levels.  Currently,  government  interventions  are \nimplemented through the National Food Authority (NFA), which is an attached agency \nof the Department of Agriculture. The NFA took over the operation of the National \nGrains  Authority  (NGA),  which  was  in  operation  from  1972  to  1981.  The \nadministration of NGA in turn succeeded the Rice and Corn Administration, which \noperated from 1962 to 1972. \n \n \nFigure 1.

As a result, farm \nprices remained below palay support prices for a number of reasons, which include an \ninadequate NFA procurement budget and delays in NFA purchases. Thus, margins are \nsqueezed, resulting in reduced investment in postharvest facilities and less planting \ngiven the unattractive price to farmers. On the other hand, in the long-run the consumer-\noriented pricing policy fails to benefit consumers as it reduces rice availability. \n  3    ", "The partial equilibrium analysis of Roumasset (2000) indicates that the excess \nburden of the current rice policy amounted to P48.79 billion in 1999. This estimate does \nnot account for the financial cost of subsidies to the NFA. \n \nIn 1999, ADB approved a loan facility amounting to US$75 million to support \ngrain policy reform in the Philippines, called the Grains Sector Development Program \n(GSDP).1 The policy framework of GSDP focused on: (i) liberalizing and instituting \nmore cost effective grains pricing and import policies; (ii) improving the administration \nof grain buffer stocks; (iii) restructuring the NFA from a grains marketing monopoly \ninto a public regulatory agency and separate private sector marketing corporation; and \n(iv) implementing a well-targeted and effective food subsidy program for the poor. \n2.2. Rice Production Structure and Prices  \nThe contribution of palay (unhusked) rice production to the gross domestic product \n(GDP) ranges from 2 to 3 percent over the last 10 years, while the share of \u201crice and \ncorn  milling\u201d  is  about  2.3  percent  (Table  1).  Among  agricultural  crops,  cereals \nproduction,  particularly  palay  rice,  dominates  in  terms  of  area  planted,  volume  of \nproduction and value of output (Table 2). From 1993 to 2002, more than 50 percent of \nagricultural area was planted with palay rice and corn. In recent years, the share of palay \nrice production increased in terms of area planted and quantity produced, as well as in \nterms of value of output. In 2002, about 38 percent of the value of output of agricultural \ncrops came from palay rice production. \n \nTable 1. Contribution of Agriculture to GDP (%) \n \n  1993 1997 2003\n  1.

In 1999, about 97 percent \nof the production was consumed as food. There are two sources of rice: local production \nand imports. During the last ten years, local production has become less and less able to \nmeet local demand because of high population growth. Thus, rice imports increased \nfrom 412,000 metric tons in 1990 to 757,000 metric tons in 1999. There was, however, \na blip in 1998, due largely to the sharp drop in palay rice production because of El Nino.  \nIn 1998, imported rice amounted to 1,856,000 metric tons. \n \n \nTable 5.

For the years where data are available, the gap \nhas more than doubled. For example, in 1988 the farmgate price of ordinary palay rice \nwas P3.2 per kilo, while the wholesale price of the same variety was P7.2 per kilo. The \nlatter is 2.25 times (or 125 percent) higher than the former. There are no data available \nfor the retail price of ordinary rice for the same year, but the data in the following year \nindicate a price of P7.9 per kilo, a figure 2.48 times higher (or 148 percent).  In 2001, \nthe gap is still more than double.  The price gaps are much higher for high-quality rice. \n \nThe retail price of rice in the local market is largely determined by the QR on \nrice imports, which limits the flow of imported rice and artificially creates a scarcity \nrent that jacks up the local price, as theoretically depicted below. Meanwhile, actual \ndata indicate that the gap between local prices of rice and world prices is large indeed. \nTake the case of the retail price of ordinary rice and the world price of rice for 35 \npercent broken, which are comparable in terms of quality. The gap has widened from 20 \npercent in 1989 to 130 percent in 2001.  \n3.  Food and Poverty \nAbout half of rural households live below poverty, while one-fifth of urban households \nfall below the poverty threshold (Table 10). More than 60 percent of expenditure of \nrural poor households is on food; about half is on cereals, consisting of rice and corn, \nwith the former having a much larger share. An almost similar structure is observed in \nthe expenditure pattern of urban poor households. Furthermore, rural and urban poor \nhouseholds\u2014landless agricultural laborers, small-scale farmers, and urban unskilled \nworkers\u2014are principally net buyers of rice (David and Otsuka (1994)). These indicate \nthat policy reforms on rice may have a significant impact on the consumption pattern of \nboth rural and urban poor households, and therefore on poverty. \n  9    ", " \n \nTable 9.

CGE Model \nThis section discusses the basic structure of the model. It introduces modifications to the \nbasic  structure  to  adequately  address  the  issues  in  the  paper.  In  particular,  the \nagriculture module is modified to allow the use of land and water in production. Rice \nimportation is augmented to include the import quota. The fertilizer price formation is \nmodified to allow for a government subsidy. Trading in both palay and rice is expanded \nto accommodate NFA\u2019s buffer stock management, which allows the setting of a rice \nprice ceiling for consumers and a palay price floor for farmers. \n4.1. Basic Structure \nA CGE model is used to carry out the analysis in the paper. An overview of the basic \nstructure of the model is given below. \n \nFigure 2 presents the basic price and volume relationships in the model. The \nmodel specifies a transformation function between exports (E) and domestic sales (D) \nusing constant elasticity of transformation (CET). If the export price (Pe) increases \nrelative  to  the  local  price  (Pl),  then  export  supply  will  increase  while  supply  for \ndomestic sales will decline. The supply side of the model assumes profit maximization. \nThe  first-order  conditions  for  profit  maximization  generate  the  necessary  supply \nfunctions and input demand functions. \n \n \nFigure 2.

In the CGE literature, \nthis substitution can also be interpreted as product differentiation, where imports and \ndomestically produced goods are treated as imperfect substitutes. If the import price in \nlocal currency (Pm) declines relative to domestic price (Pd), the demand for imports \nwill increase while demand for local goods will decline. The first-order conditions for \ncost minimization generate the import and domestic demand functions.  \n \nOutput price (Px) is the composite of export price (Pe) and local prices (Pl). \nIndirect taxes are added to the local price to determine domestic prices (Pd), which \ntogether with import price (Pm) will determine the composite commodity price (Pq). \nThe composite price is the price paid by the consumers. \n \nThe import price (Pm) is denominated in domestic currency, and is affected by \nthe world price of imports, exchange rate (er), tariff rate (tm), and indirect tax rate (itx). \nThe direct effect of a tariff reduction, for example, is a reduction in Pm. If the reduction \nin Pm is significant enough, the composite price (Pq) will also decline. \n \nHouseholds maximize utility based on a linear expenditure system (LES). The \nrelationship for intermediate demand assumes a set of fixed Leontief coefficients. The \nmodel consists of a one-period (static) set of relationships. Sectoral capital, as well as \nlabor supply, is fixed. Furthermore, it assumes that total savings are invested.  \n \nThe macroeconomic closure is as follows: \n \nTotal (E\u2212M) = Total (S\u2212I) + Total (Tx\u2212G)  \n \nwhere E is total exports of goods and services, M is total imports of goods and services, \nS is total private savings, I is total private investment, Tx is total government income \nand G is total government expenditure.  \n \nThe total (E\u2212M), which is the external balance, is assumed to be fixed. This is \nalso equivalent to assuming constant foreign savings. However, sectoral exports and \nimports are not fixed. They respond to changes in the relative price ratio between Pe and \nPl, which is the real exchange rate. The nominal exchange rate, er, is fixed. \n \nThe total (S\u2212I), which represents the private sector balance, is solved in the \nmodel. The total (Tx\u2212G), which is the government balance, is closed using various \nclosure rules that are discussed in detail below. However, in all the macroeconomic \nclosure rules that are applied, government expenditure remains fixed.  \n4.2. Modifications \nAgricultural Production. The basic model as described above uses equality constraints. \nHowever, this may be inadequate if applied to issues pertaining to agriculture. For \nexample, land and water inputs may not be as substitutable as capital and labor in a \nwell-behaved  production  function.  Often,  they  are  used  in  fixed  proportions.  In  a \n 1  2   ", "numbers of instances, land and water may not be paid according to their marginal \nproduct  contributions,  or  may  not  even  be  paid at all. Highly seasonal agriculture \nproduction results in the underutilization of land and water during certain periods of a \ngiven year. Thus, inequality constraints are more appropriate in modeling agriculture \n(Hazell and Norton (1986)).  \n \nFigure  3  shows  how  the  agricultural  module  of  the  model  is  re-specified. \nSimilar  to  the  basic  model,  output  is  a  linear  combination  of  value  added  and \nintermediate inputs, with the latter determined by a set of fixed Leontief coefficients. \nHowever, this added time value is a CES combination of three factor inputs: capital, an \naggregate labor input, and an aggregate land and water input. Capital is fixed, while \naggregate labor is specified as a nested CES function of skilled and unskilled labor. \nFollowing Robinson and Gehlhar (1996) the aggregate land and water input is specified \nas a nested linear combination of land and water.   \n \n \nFigure 3.

Basically, a model based on MCP contains \na system of simultaneous equations (linear or nonlinear), which are a mixture of strict \nequalities and inequalities. The system works in such a way that each of the inequalities \nis  linked  with  a  bounded  variable  in  a  complementary-slackness  relationship \n(Rutherford  (1995)).  The  basic  idea  is  similar  to  the  Kuhn-Tucker  necessary  and \nsufficient conditions for optimality. \n 1  3   ", "The agriculture production sector module in the revised model is specified as \nMCP. The details are presented in Table 11. Equation (1) is the value added (VA) CES \nfunction of three factor inputs: an aggregate labor (L), capital (K), and aggregate input \nconsisting of land and water (LW). \u03c1 is a substitution parameter, \u03ba is a scale parameter \nand \u03c9 are factor weights. Equation (2) is a nested aggregate labor CES function of \nskilled (Ls) and unskilled labor (Lu). Like (1), this equation has 3 sets of parameters (\u03d5, \n\u03b2, \u03c8). Equations (3) and (4) are demand functions for land (LN) and water (WA), \nrespectively, which are linearly related to (LW) using fixed coefficients (\u03b1). \n \nEquation (5) is the demand for the aggregate labor function, which is the first-\norder condition of profit maximization using the production function in (1). Pva is the \nvalue added price. Equation (6) is the first-order condition for cost minimization with \n(2) as the production constraint. This equation yields the demand functions for the two \ntypes of labor. Equation (7) gives the average wage (w), which is the average of the \nwage for skilled labor (ws) and unskilled labor (wu). \n \nEquations (8) to (13) are a set of relationships that capture the complementary \nslackness  conditions  for  optimization  involving  land  and  water.  In  particular,  the \nconditions involve the relationship between the overall rent for the use of land and \nwater, and their demand and supply situation. Like (5), Equation (8) is the demand for \naggregate  LW,  and  is  derived  as  one  of  the  first-order  conditions  for  profit \nmaximization. Equation (9) is the average rent for the use of (LW). It is the weighted \naverage of the rent for land use and the rent for water use. However, both the rents for \nland use and water use have two components: (rln + rln_p) for land use and (rwa + \nrwa_p) for water use. The variables with the suffix _p signify the rent when land and \nwater constraints are not binding. In this case these variables have a value of 1 when the \nsupply of both water (WAS) and land (LNS) are greater than the corresponding demand. \nThese are presented in Equations (10) and (11). When the constraints are binding, \nhowever, the overall rent for land use is (rln + rl_p) and for water use (rwa + rwa_p). \nThe economic interpretation for this is that when the constraint is binding, the shadow \nprice for the use of the resource is higher. Thus, if in agriculture the supply of water is \nbinding, the overall cost of production is higher. If the water supply is increased (e.g. \nimprovements in irrigation are carried out), this relaxes the constraints and reduces the \ncost of production. Equations (12) and (13) are the demand for land and water.4 \n \nEquation (14) is the zero-profit condition, which is required in competitive \nequilibrium models. It shows that value added is fully used to pay for the use of capital \n(r\u22c5K), labor (w\u22c5L) and land and water. Lastly, Equations (15) and (16) determine the \nmarket for skilled and unskilled labor. \n                                                 \n4 For a detailed discussion see Robinson and Gehlhar (1995)  \n 1  4   ", "Table 11.

There are complicated issues to deal with when modeling import \nquotas (Francois and Reinert [1997]). In their paper, the import quota is viewed as a \nprice distortion effect. If the domestic price of a good that is under an import quota is \ncompared with its equivalent world price, then the price distortion effect of the quota \ncan be computed. In the literature, this is called the price-gap method of estimating the \ntariff-equivalent of a quota, which is analogous to an ad valorem tariff rate.  \n \nFigure 4 shows the theoretical framework for modeling the import quota. The \nvertical axis shows the local price of imports, while the horizontal axis is the import \n 1  5   ", "volume. The import demand is downward sloping. The small country assumption is \nused in the analysis. This means that supply is perfectly elastic at a given world price of \nimports. If there is no import distortion, imports will be at M1. The corresponding price \nof imports is Pm1, which is the world price (Pwm) converted into domestic prices using \nthe exchange rate (er). If a tariff (tm) is introduced, then import volume falls to M2. The \nprice of imports will be Pm2. When imported goods are sold in the domestic market, \nthey face an additional indirect tax (itx) similar to other domestic goods sold in the \nmarket. In this case, the import volume is reduced to M3, while the price is increased to \nPm3. \n \nFurthermore,  if  imports  are  restricted  by  a  quota,  say  at  M4,  then  the \ncorresponding price will be higher. Thus, on top of the tariff rate and the indirect tax \nrate, there is an additional price mark-up due to the scarcity premium, which we call rr. \nThe final local market price of imports will be Pm4. This distortion will generate three \ntypes of revenue: tariff revenue, (Pm2 \u2013 Pm1) \u00d7 M4, and the indirect tax revenue, (Pm3 \u2013 \nPm2) \u00d7 M4, both of which will go to the government, and the quota rent, (Pm4 \u2013 Pm3) \u00d7 \nM4, which will go to the holder of the import rights. This analysis of the quota is \nmodeled as MCP, and presented in Table 12. \n \nEquation  (17)  is  a  CES  aggregation  of  imported  (M)  and  domestically \nproduced commodities (D). The resulting good is called the composite commodity (Q). \nThis equation captures product differentiation between (M) and (D). Equation (18) is \nthe first-order condition for cost minimization with (17) as the constraint. This equation \nyields the demand for imports. Thus, if the import price (Pm) decreases relative to \ndomestic prices (Pd), imports will increase relative to domestically produced goods. \nEquation (19) gives the domestic price of imports inclusive of tariffs (tm), indirect tax \n(itx), and import quota scarcity premium (rr).   \n \n \n 1  6   ", "Figure 4.

Equation (21) is the domestic price \n(Pd) inclusive of indirect taxes. The local price before the indirect tax is (Pl),  the cost of \nproduction  of  domestically  produced  goods.  Equations  (22)  and  (23)  give  a \ncomplementary slackness relationship between the import quota scarcity premium (rr) \nand the quota rent (Re). If the quota is not binding, then (rr) is zero; otherwise it has a \npositive value. \n \nEquation (24) shows the consumer price (Pc) equal to the composite price (Pq). \nThus, if (rr) is positive, (Pq) will be higher, and so will be (Pc). Equations (25) and (26) \nallocate the quota rent to the holders of import rights. In the case of the Philippines, \nNFA is the major holder of quota rights. However, it issues a very limited number of \nimport licenses to private importers. Thus, household income (25) will increase by its \nshare in the quota rent, while government income will also increase by its share in the \n 1  7   ", "rent.  The  other  components  of  household  income  (Yh)  consist  of  factor  incomes, \ntransfers and other incomes.

Fertilizer is an industrial \ninput that is used heavily in agricultural production. It is also critical to palay rice \nproduction,  as  presented  in  Table  7.  One  policy  instrument  that  may  be  used  in \nsupporting agriculture is a fertilizer price subsidy. In this model, the price subsidy is \nalso specified as MCP as in Robinson, et al (1997).

It is the composite price \n(Pq) of imported and domestically produced inputs. To make it more general, it is \nfurther augmented to include a consumption tax (tc) for the use of the input and price \nsubsidy (spc). The ceiling on price is in Equation (28). In this equation, if the input price \n(Pc) exceeds the ceiling price (Pc*), then the price subsidy (spc) will be positive. The \nmodel will search for the value of the price subsidy that will retain the inequality in \n(28). \n \nOne should note that the price subsidy is introduced not on the production side, \nbut in consumption. Furthermore, the subsidy changes the relative sectoral consumption \npc\nprice, i.e.  i  for sector i \u2260 j \npc\n  j\nEquation  (29)  gives  the  effect  of  the  price  subsidy  on  the  income  of  the \ngovernment.

One of the key \ngovernment interventions in rice activities in the Philippines is the setting of a price \nceiling to protect consumers, the setting of price floors to protect rice farmers, and the \nmaintenance of a buffer stock to assure an adequate supply of rice. All these are done \nthrough NFA. In the model, this mechanism is specified as MCP as in Robinson et al \n(1997) and presented in Table 14. \n   \n \nTable 14.

Equation (33) sets the lower bound of NFA\u2019s buffer stock of \nrice,  while  Equation  (34)  sets  the  upper  bound.  Equation  (35)  is  the  buffer  stock \nequation of NFA. If the farmgate price of palay (Px) goes below the set price floor \n(Pxf*), then NFA will start buying palay (N_buy) to support the farmers. The support \nbuying is an artificial demand and will continue until the inequality in (31) is recovered. \nHowever, these support buying activities will increase the level of the buffer stock.5 In \nthe  product  market  equilibrium  equation  in  (36),  the  support  buying  by  the  NFA \neffectively increases the overall demand for the commodity (demand elements come in \nas positive in the right-hand side of the equation). Also, since NFA is a government \nagency, its support buying of palay means additional expenditures for the government, \nas shown in Equation (38). \n \nOn the other hand, if the consumer price of rice exceeds the set price ceiling, \nNFA will sell rice (N_sel) to the general public to increase the supply of rice artificially. \nThe selling of rice will persist until the inequality in (32) is recovered. However, the \nselling of rice to the domestic market drains the buffer stock level of NFA in (35). If the \nselling continues and violates (33), i.e., the buffer stock level goes below the critical \nlevel set by (N_stk*), then NFA will start importing rice (N_m) to replenish the amount \nl\nof rice sold onto the market. These rice imports will be reflected in the current account \nbalance  in  Equation  (37).  Furthermore,  the  government  will  have  to  pay  for  this \nimported rice as shown in Equation (38). A similar mechanism will occur, but in the \nreverse direction, if the buffer stock exceeds the upper bound as a result of heavy \nsupport buying of palay. The government then has to export the excess stock of rice, \nwhich will in turn generate revenue. Exports of rice will be reflected in the current \naccount balance. \n \nThe  model  is  programmed  with  the GAMS  (General  Algebraic  Modelling \nSystem).

In general, the \nFGT poverty measure is7  \n \n1 q \uf8ebz - y \uf8f6\u03b1\nP = \u2211 i  \n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u03b1 n \uf8ed z \uf8f8\ni=1\n                                                 \n7 See Ravallion (1992) for a detailed discussion.  \n 2  4   ", "where n is population size, q is number of people below the poverty line, y isincome, z \ni   \nis the poverty threshold. The poverty threshold is equal to the food threshold plus the \nnon-food threshold, where threshold refers to the cost of basic food and non-food \nrequirements. The parameter \u03b1 can have three values, each one indicating a measure of \npoverty. The headcount index of poverty has \u03b1 = 0. This is the common index of \npoverty,  which  measures  the  proportion  of  the  population  whose  income  (or \nconsumption) falls below the poverty threshold. The poverty gap index has \u03b1 = 1. This \nmeasures the depth of poverty in the sense that it indicates how far below on average the \npoor are from the poverty threshold. The poverty severity index has \u03b1 = 2. This measure \nis sensitive to the distribution among the poor, as more weight is given to those furthest \nbelow the poverty threshold. This is because the poverty severity index corresponds to \nthe squared average distance of income of the poor from the poverty line, and hence \ngives more weight to the poorest of the poor in the population. \n \nTo capture the extent of poverty before the policy experiment on rice reform, \nactual household income and the poverty line from the 1994 FIES were used to compute \nthe FGT indices. These indices serve as the base in the analysis. Households were \ngrouped according to the classification in Table 15. \n \nThe  policy  experiment  using  the  CGE  model  generates  the  change  in  the \naverage income of the representative household groups defined in Table 15. These \naverage income changes are applied to the actual household income in the FIES to \ndetermine the impact of the policy on household income. \n \n The CGE simulation also generates the change in the consumer price of goods \ndefined in the model. The consumption weights of each household group in Table 17 \nwere  used  to  calculate  the  weighted  consumer  price  of  each  of  the  groups.  The \ncomputed change in the weighted consumer price was used to compute the nominal \nchange in the poverty line after the policy experiment. In particular, the actual poverty \nthreshold at the base is set at Z =P \u00d7X , where Z  is the poverty threshold, P  the \n0 0 0 0 0\nconsumer price, and X  is the \u2018minimum basic needs\u2019. The \u2018minimum basic needs\u2019 are \n0\nassumed to be fixed before and after the policy experiment.  \n \nThe new poverty threshold is computed by replacing P with a new price that is \n0 \nderived using the results for the weighted consumer price from the CGE model. That is, \nZ =P \u00d7X  where Z  is the new poverty threshold and P is the new price derived using \n1 1 0 1 1 \nthe results from the CGE simulation. Since the \u2018minimum basic needs\u2019 are assumed \nfixed, in effect this process changes the nominal value of the poverty threshold. \n \nThe change in household income and the change in the nominal value of the \npoverty threshold after the policy experiment generate a new set of FGT indices These \nare compared with the FGT at the base to determine whether a policy change is poverty-\nimproving or not. \n 2  5   ", "6.  Policy Simulation \n6.1. Definition of Policy Experiments \nTable  20  summarizes  the  policy  experiments  conducted  in  the  paper.  The  first \nexperiment involves a reform of the trade policy for rice consisting of a zero import \nquota and a reduced tariff on rice imports to 10 percent without poverty-offsetting \nmeasures. The rest of the experiments involve various combinations of policy reform \nand poverty-reducing measures. \n \n \nTable 20.

The first is the setting of the QR \non imported rice. The QR is set so that the resulting local price of imported rice is 2.2 \ntimes (or 120 percent) the price without the QR. This is the average price gap over the \nperiod 1995-2001 (Table 9). The second step is the complete elimination of the QR and \nthe reduction of the tariff rates of palay and rice imports from 40 percent to 10 percent. \nThe solutions of the model in the first and second steps are compared to determine the \nimpact on resource allocation, household income and consumer prices.  \n \nGovernment income is fixed in the experiment. Thus, any loss in government \nrevenue from the implementation of the policy reform is compensated by an additional \nindirect output tax. The compensatory indirect output tax is applied in the following \nmanner \n \nPd =Pl \u00d7(1+itx \u00d7[1+ntaxr]) \ni i i\n \nwhere Pd is the domestic price of sector i, Pl the local prices before taxes, itx the \ni i i\nindirect tax rate at the base, and ntaxr the endogenously determined compensatory tax. \nNote that ntaxr in this case introduces two effects: (a) it creates an additional wedge \n 2  6   ", "between domestic and local prices, and (b) it changes the relative sectoral domestic \nPd\nprice, i.e.  i  for sector i \u2260 j. Both will generate inefficiency effects.  \nPd\nj\n \nExperiment SIM_2 is similar to the first except that the direct income tax rates \nof the following household groups: urb1, rur1 and rur4, are reduced by 50 percent as a \npoverty-offsetting measure. The loss in government revenue is offset by a compensatory \nindirect output tax similar to SIM_1. \n \nExperiment SIM_3 is also similar to the first except that government transfers \nto the following household groups: urb1, rur1 and rur4, are increased by 10 percent as a \npoverty-offsetting measure. Overall government balance is held fixed by introducing an \noffsetting compensatory indirect output tax similar to SIM_1. \n \nExperiment SIM_4 is also similar to the first except that the price of fertilizer \nis subsidized by 50 percent by the government as a poverty-offsetting measure. The \nprice  subsidy  specification  is  given  in  Table  13.  The  subsidy  is  financed  by  a \ncompensatory direct income tax, which is applied in the following manner \n \nDyh =Y \u00d7(1\u2212dtxr \u00d7[1+ntaxr]) \nh h h\n \nwhere Dyh  is the disposable income of household h, Y  is income, dtxr  is the direct \nh h h\nincome tax rate at the base, and ntaxr is the compensatory tax.8 The price subsidy is \nnegative income for the government. When the subsidy is implemented, ntaxr will have \na positive value until total government income is maintained at a specified level. A \npositive ntaxr will increase the direct income tax rate, which in turn will lead to higher \ngovernment direct tax revenue and lower household disposable income. Note further \nthat by design, the compensatory tax is progressive in the sense that the increase in the \ndirect income tax is higher for those households with higher direct income tax rates, \ndtxr . Thus, in this system there is a built-in redistribution effect of the compensatory \nh\ndirect income tax.9 \n \nExperiment SIM_5 is similar to SIM_4 except that the subsidy is financed by a \ncompensatory indirect output tax similar to SIM_1. \n6.2. Simulation Results \n6.2.1.   Removal of the QR and Reduction in the Tariff  \nSIM_1. The import price of \u2018rice and corn milling\u2019 in local currency (\u03b4pm) drops \ni\nsignificantly by \u201364 percent as a result of the removal of the QR (Table 21). This \n                                                 \n8 Note that labor supply is fixed. Therefore, the compensatory direct income tax is not distortive in the \nsense that it does not affect relative commodity prices. \n9 Alternatively,  one  can  specify  a  compensatory  direct  income  tax  that  is  neutral  with  respect  to \ndistribution.  \n 2  7   ", "translates into a surge in rice imports (\u03b4m) by 3,676 percent.10 On the other hand, the \ni\nconsumer  prices  (\u03b4pc)  for  irrigated  palay,  non-irrigated  palay,  and  \u2018rice  and  corn \ni\nmilling\u2019 decline by -4.1 percent, -3.2 percent, and -4.9 percent, respectively. Domestic \ndemand (\u03b4d) in these sectors also declines.

The output prices (\u03b4px) of irrigated palay, non-irrigated palay and \u2018rice \ni\nand corn milling\u2019 drop by \u20134.2 percent, \u20133.2 percent, and \u20133.8 respectively, while the \nvolume  of  output  (\u03b4x)  declines  by  \u20131.9  percent,  \u20131.6  percent,  and  \u20132  percent, \ni\nrespectively.  \n \nIncidentally, these results can be reversed to argue that the distortive effects of \nthe QR on rice imports attract resources into palay production and away from other \nagricultural  crops.  This  movement  of  resources  creates  inefficiency  in  resource \nallocation within the agriculture sector as well as in the rest of the economy. \n                                                 \n10 Although the increase is large, the share of rice imports remains relatively small compared to the share \nof domestic rice. \n11 The elasticity of substitution for these commodities is high at 3.7 (Table 19). This parameter came from \nthe APEX model (Agricultural Policy Experiment Model, Clarete and Warr (1992)) whose parameters \nwere estimated econometrically using Philippine data. \n 2  8   ", "One result that ought to be highlighted is the overall decline in consumer prices \n(\u03b4pc) by \u20130.5 percent.

Because of the drop in output and price of \npalay and rice, the demand for factors and the factor prices drop as well. For example, \nthe return to capital used in palay production and in \u2018rice and corn milling\u2019 drops \nsignificantly relative to the other sectors (Table 22). The demand for labor also drops in \nthose sectors. Wages for agriculture labor and unskilled production workers decline by \n\u20131.7 and \u20130.5 percent, respectively. Put together, these effects on value added are \nunfavourable to the palay rice sector in general. \n \nThe effects on income, weighted consumer prices, poverty and distribution \nacross household groups are summarized in Table 23. Largely because of the drop in \nfactor prices, overall household income declines as the QR is removed and the tariff on \nrice imports is reduced. Because this drop is mainly caused by the surge in rice imports, \n 2  9   ", "it can be thought of as a displacement effect. The largest drop is observed in households \nin rur1 (\u22121.4 percent), followed by rur4 (\u22120.97 percent), and ur1 (\u22120.94 percent). \nThese households are highly dependent on factor incomes derived from agriculture \n(Table 18). Furthermore, these household groups have the lowest per capita income \n(Table 16). Thus, the impact worsens the income inequality problem as indicated by the \nincrease of 0.24 percent in the Gini coefficient.   \n \n \nTable 23.

However, the drop in consumer prices is not significant enough to \ncounter the negative income effects on critical households with a very high incidence of \npoverty, or the poorest of the poor. For example, the headcount index for rur1 increases \nby 0.3 percent, for rur4 by 0.15 percent, and for urb1 by 0.11 percent. The worsening \nof poverty in these groups can also be observed from the larger increases in the poverty \ngap and severity indices. As these indices give more distributional weight to those \nfurthest below the poverty threshold, the average income of the poor in those household \ngroups has moved further away from the poverty threshold. This also means that the \ndegree of their poverty has increased as the QR on rice is eliminated and tariff on rice \nimports is reduced. \n \nOn the whole, while the overall poverty headcount drops, the elimination of the \nQR and the reduction of the tariff on rice imports can be described as generally not pro-\npoor. It also worsens the income inequality problem. The drop in consumer prices is not \nsignificant enough to mitigate the negative effect on income, especially in household \n 3  0   ", "groups where the problem of poverty is severe. The next four experiments implement \npolicy measures that can offset the negative poverty effects on households that are \nadversely affected, particularly urb1, rur1, and rur4. \n6.2.2.   QR Removal, Tariff Reduction, and Poverty-Offsetting Measures \nTable 24 summarizes the results of the experiments where the removal of the QR and \nthe reduction in the tariff on rice imports are accompanied by various poverty-offsetting \nmeasures. The results for the Philippines and for the three poorest household types that \nare negatively affected by the reform are presented in the table. \n \nTable 24.

It shows a favorable \neffect  on  overall  poverty  as  the  three  poverty  indices  indicate  negative  changes. \nHowever, no improvement is observed for rur1, which is the poorest household. This is \nbecause this group has an almost zero direct tax rate, and thus a 50 percent reduction in \nthe  rate  does  not  make  any  difference.  Thus,  the  poverty  situation  for  this  group \ndeteriorates. Income distribution also worsens as indicated by the increase in the Gini \ncoefficient, because the poorest household group is not favorably affected while the \nother groups are. \n  \nSIM_3 involves a 10 percent increase in government transfers to the three \ngroups, financed by a compensatory indirect output tax. The overall improvement in \npoverty is better here than in the previous case, as indicated by a larger reduction in all \npoverty indices. The largest improvement is observed in rur1 because, being the poorest \ngroup, it receives a larger amount of government transfer. Thus, a 10 percent increase \n 3  1   ", "has a greater benefit on this group than on the other two. Also, there is an improvement \nin distribution as indicated by a reduction in the Gini coefficient. \n \nSIM_4  involves  a  50  percent  fertilizer  price  subsidy  by  the  government \nfinanced by a progressive compensatory direct income tax. This experiment also brings \nabout a favorable poverty effect as the three indices show reductions for the three \ngroups. Income distribution also improves. However, the improvement in poverty and \ndistribution is lower than in SIM_3.  \n \nSIM_5 also involves a 50 percent fertilizer price subsidy by the government. \nHowever, the subsidy is financed by a compensatory indirect output tax, which as \nshown earlier creates distortionary effects. The results indicate that while the overall \npoverty  as  well  as  the  poverty  for  the  three  groups  improves,  the  effect  is  lower \ncompared to SIM_4. This is because the increase in the indirect tax creates an additional \nwedge between the Pd and Pl in all commodities. Thus, it reduces the full price effects \nof the removal of the QR, the reduction in the tariff, and the fertilizer price subsidy. \nThis additional price wedge is not created in SIM_4. \n \nThus, the results of the experiments indicate that the policy that would lead to \nhigher  poverty-offsetting  effects  for  the  three  poorest  household  groups  that  are \nadversely affected by market reforms in rice is an increase in the direct government \ntransfers to these groups. \n7.  Conclusion and Policy Recommendation \nThe QR on rice will be phased out by the end of 2004. While this policy reform may be \njustified for efficiency purposes,12 the displacement effects of the expected surge in rice \nimports will translate into larger negative income effects for household groups where \nthe problem of poverty is most severe. This is because these groups rely heavily on \nagriculture, particularly palay rice production, which is expected to contract when the \nQR is removed and the tariff is reduced. As a result, factor demand and factor prices in \nagriculture will drop. Factor incomes derived from agricultural production will decline \nas well. While all household groups will enjoy reduced prices of rice as the QR is \nremoved and the tariff reduced, the drop in consumer prices will not be significant \nenough to mitigate the decline in income for those groups that are adversely affected. \nThus, all poverty indicators for these groups show higher values, indicating a worsening \nof their poverty situation. Furthermore, the overall Gini coefficient increases, which \nindicates a worsening of income inequality.  \n \nThe policy lesson that may be drawn from this exercise is that while market \nreform  is  generally  necessary,  it  has  to  be  carried  out  carefully,  especially  if \nimplemented on a critical commodity such as rice. Although market reforms in rice can \npotentially  have  favorable  effects  on  consumer  prices  in  general,  some  household \ngroups  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  expected  surge  in  rice  imports.  Policy \n                                                 \n12 It  has  been  established  numerically  in  the  paper  that  resource  allocation  favors  palay  and  rice \nproduction over \u2018other agricultural crops\u2019 under a regime of rice protection. \n 3  2   ", "measures may have to be designed to counter these effects. Among the various poverty-\noffsetting measures experimented with in the paper, the results indicate that an increase \nin direct government transfers to the adversely affected household groups  provides a \nbetter safety net. However, this is more of a short-run policy measure. Other policy \nmeasures  that  may  have  favorable  longer-term  implications  include  productivity \nimprovement  through  a  vigorous  program  of  intensified  use  of  high-yielding  rice \nvarieties, irrigation, better farm-to-market roads, and measures to encourage the growth \nof other non-rice crops. \n \n 3  3   ", "References \nAsian Development Bank (1999). \u201cReport and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Governors on Proposed Loans and Technical Assistance Grant to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Grains Sector Development Program\u201d.
