This  paper  uses  a \n\ncomputable  general  equilibrium  (CGE)  model  to  analyze  the  possible  poverty  and  distributional \n\neffects  of  the  removal  of  the  QR  and  the  reduction  in  tariffs  on  rice  imports.  Policy  experiments \n\nindicate that while market reforms in rice lead to a reduction in the overall headcount poverty index, \n\nboth the poverty gap and the squared poverty gap indices increase. The Gini coefficient rises as well. \n\nIn general, these results imply that the poorest of the poor are adversely affected.  \n\nIn  particular,  while  market  reforms  in  rice  bring  about  a  reduction  in  consumer  prices \n\nthat is favorable to all, imports of rice surge and generate displacement effects on poor households \n\nthat  rely  heavily  on  agriculture  for  factor  incomes,  particularly on  palay  rice  production  and  other \n\nrelated activities. Palay production and its output price decline. This translates to lower demand for \n\nfactor  inputs  in  the  sector,  lower  factor  prices  in  agriculture,  and  lower  factor  incomes  for  these \n\nhouseholds.  Thus,  poverty  in  these  groups,  as  well  as  general  income  inequality,  deteriorates. \n\nHowever, the results of the experiments involving various poverty-offsetting measures indicate that \n\nan increase in direct government transfers to these household groups can provide a better safety net. \n\n \n\n \n\nIII\n\n\f \n\nIV\n\n\fTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.

Cororaton\u2020 \n \n \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  Philippines  is  one  of  the  three  countries  granted  exemption  in  1995  from  the \nremoval  of  quantitative  restrictions  (QR)  on  rice  under  Annex  5  of  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  agreement.  Japan  and  South  Korea  are  the  other  two.  The \nexemption will expire on December 31, 2004. The primary objective of this paper is to \nexamine the possible poverty and distributional effects of the removal of the QR and the \nreduction  in  tariffs  on  rice  imports.  In  particular,  it  attempts  to  analyze  the  following \nissues:  (a)  Do  the  poor  share  in  the  potential  gains  from  a  freer  market  for  rice?  (b) \nWhat  alternative  or  accompanying  policy  measures  may  be  needed  to  ensure  a  more \nequitable distribution of the potential gains from a more liberalized market for rice? (c) \nWhat  is  the  transmission  mechanism  through  which  the  removal  of  the  control  may \naffect  the  poor?  These  are  critical  issues  that  the  government  must  address  as  it \nimplements market reform and opens the economy to imported rice. \n\n \nRice  is  the  staple  food  for  about  80  percent  of  Filipinos,  and  is  therefore  a \nmajor  item  in  the  consumption  basket  of  consumers.  It  is  the  single  most  important \nagricultural  crop  in  the  Philippines,  and  is  therefore  a  major  source  of  income  for \nmillions  of  Filipino  farmers.  Because  of  its  political  significance,  the  government  is \nheavily involved both in its supply and distribution to assure consumers a sufficient and \nstable  supply  at  low  prices  and  to  maintain  a  reasonable  return  to  rice  farmers  with \nadequate price incentives. One major policy instrument of the government at present is \nthe control on imported rice through the QR. \n\n \nMarket reform in general and the removal of the QR on rice in particular could \nhave economy-wide effects. In this regard, it is appropriate to analyze these issues using \na computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated to an input-output table and \nnational  accounts  data.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  appropriate  to  study  the  effects  of \nreforms on poverty and income distribution using individual household data to capture \nthe  heterogeneity  of  households.  This  paper  integrates  these  two  approaches.  In \nparticular, it specifies and calibrates an agriculture-focused CGE model to a set of actual \ndata  and  simulates  the  effects  of  the  removal  of  the  QR  on  consumer  prices  and \nhousehold income, and applies these results to a set of individual household data in the \nFamily  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  (FIES)  to  compute  the  poverty  and  income \ndistribution effects. \n\n                                                 \n\u2020  This  paper  was  written  while  the  author  was  a  Visiting  Researcher  at  the  Asian  Development  Bank \nInstitute from December 2003 to May 2004. Support from the Institute and the comments of John Weiss \non the earlier versions of the paper are gratefully acknowledged. However, the author is responsible for \nremaining errors and gaps in the analysis. \n\n      1\n\n\fA number of studies in the Philippines have looked at policy issues concerning \nrice,  but  the  methodology  applied  is  mostly  partial  equilibrium  analysis.  Partial \nequilibrium analysis however underestimates the possible effects of the reforms because \nrice, being a major agricultural crop, has many direct and indirect linkages with the rest \nof  the  economy.  Furthermore,  most  of  the  empirical  work  done  does  not  extend  the \nanalysis to look at the impact on poverty. While existing literature provides estimates of \nchanges in consumer and producer surpluses, as well as the Gini coefficient, it does not \nprovide  insights  on  the  effects  on  poverty  and  on  the  depth  of  poverty.  This  paper \naddresses this methodological gap in the literature. \n\n \nIn  the  CGE  literature  there  are  two  broad  approaches  to  integrating  a  CGE \nmodel with national household surveys to analyze poverty and distributional issues. One \nis through microsimulation wherein the household categories in the model are the same \nas  the  household  categories  in  the  national  household  survey.  As  such,  this  approach \nallows for the heterogeneity of individual households during the numerical computation \nof the equilibrium of the model. The papers of Cogneau and Robillard (2000), Cockburn \n(2001), and Cororaton and Cockburn (2004) employ this approach.  \n\n \nThe other approach is a more recursive one. For a given policy shock, a CGE \nmodel  with  representative  households  is  used  to  estimate  the  change  in  the  average \nincome for each household category and the change in prices. These changes are then \napplied to an assumed income distribution of each household category (either lognormal \nor  beta  distribution)  to  conduct  poverty  and  distributional  analyses.  The  variance  and \nother  parameters  of  the  distribution  are  estimated  using  data  from  the  national \nhousehold survey and are assumed fixed in the analyses, while the first moment of the \ndistribution is altered using the results from the CGE model. The papers of De Janvry, \nSadoulet and Fargeix (1991) and Decaluwe, Dumot, and Savard (1999) and Decaluwe, \nParty, Savard, and Thorbecke (2000) employ this approach. The present paper applies \nthis second approach, but uses the actual income distribution from the 1994 FIES. \n\n \nThe paper is organized in seven sections. The second discusses the government \npolicies  in  the  rice  sector  and  the  production  structure  of  the  sector,  including  prices. \nThe third looks at current issues of food and poverty. The fourth discusses in detail the \nmodel  used  in  the  analysis,  including  the  parameters,  the  elasticities  and  the  model \nstructure  at  the  base.  The  fifth  gives  a  description  of  the  poverty  and  distribution \nmeasures  used  in  the  analysis.  The  sixth  outlines  the  various  policy  experiments \nconducted  and  discusses  the  results.  The  final  section  summarizes  the  results  of  the \nexperiments and draws insights for policy. \n\n2.  The Rice Sector \n\n2.1.  Rice Policy \n\nBecause of the political significance of rice, the government is heavily involved both in \nits  supply  and  distribution  to  assure  consumers  a  sufficient  and  stable  supply  at  low \nprices and to maintain reasonable return to rice farmers with adequate price incentives. \nFigure  1  presents  a  broad  diagram  of  how  government  interventions  may  have \n\n      2\n\n\finfluenced  activities  in  rice.  Three  major  components  affect  the  supply  of  rice:  local \nproduction,  buffer  stock,  and  imports.  On  the  other  hand,  three  factors  affect  the \ndemand side: domestic market, buffer stock and exports.  \n\n \nThe  present  pricing  policy  of  the  government  involves  the  setting  and \ndefending of price floor and ceiling. It also minimizes seasonal price variations in the \nvarious  regions.  Furthermore,  the  government  monopolizes  the  importation  and \nexportation  of  rice  through  its  various  procurement  and  disbursement  operations  in \norder  to  influence  domestic  price  levels.  Currently,  government  interventions  are \nimplemented through the National Food Authority (NFA), which is an attached agency \nof  the  Department  of  Agriculture.  The  NFA  took  over  the  operation  of  the  National \nGrains  Authority  (NGA),  which  was  in  operation  from  1972  to  1981.  The \nadministration  of  NGA  in  turn  succeeded  the  Rice  and  Corn  Administration,  which \noperated from 1962 to 1972. \n\n \n \n\n  \n\nFigure 1.

As  a  result,  farm \nprices remained below palay support prices for a number of reasons, which include an \ninadequate NFA procurement budget and delays in NFA purchases. Thus, margins are \nsqueezed,  resulting  in  reduced  investment  in  postharvest  facilities  and  less  planting \ngiven the unattractive price to farmers. On the other hand, in the long-run the consumer-\noriented pricing policy fails to benefit consumers as it reduces rice availability. \n\nLocal\nProduction\n\nBuffer\nStock\n\nImports\n\nSupply\n\n      3\n\n\fThe partial equilibrium analysis of Roumasset (2000) indicates that the excess \nburden of the current rice policy amounted to P48.79 billion in 1999. This estimate does \nnot account for the financial cost of subsidies to the NFA. \n\n \nIn 1999, ADB approved a loan facility amounting to US$75 million to support \ngrain policy reform in the Philippines, called the Grains Sector Development Program \n(GSDP).1 The  policy  framework  of  GSDP  focused  on:  (i)  liberalizing  and  instituting \nmore cost effective grains pricing and import policies; (ii) improving the administration \nof  grain  buffer  stocks;  (iii)  restructuring  the  NFA  from  a  grains  marketing  monopoly \ninto a public regulatory agency and separate private sector marketing corporation; and \n(iv) implementing a well-targeted and effective food subsidy program for the poor. \n\n2.2.  Rice Production Structure and Prices  \n\nThe  contribution  of  palay  (unhusked)  rice  production  to  the  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) ranges  from 2 to  3  percent over the  last 10 years, while the share of \u201crice and \ncorn  milling\u201d  is  about  2.3  percent  (Table  1).  Among  agricultural  crops,  cereals \nproduction,  particularly  palay  rice,  dominates  in  terms  of  area  planted,  volume  of \nproduction and value of output (Table 2). From 1993 to 2002, more than 50 percent of \nagricultural area was planted with palay rice and corn. In recent years, the share of palay \nrice production increased in terms of area planted and quantity produced, as well as in \nterms of value of output. In 2002, about 38 percent of the value of output of agricultural \ncrops came from palay rice production. \n \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Over  the  last  three  decades,  the  share  of  MV  production  has \nalmost doubled from 55 percent in 1970 to 95 percent in 1999 (Table 3). The production \nof MV palay rice is more productive than TV in terms of yield per hectare. In 1970, the \naverage productivity of MV production was 1.93 metric tons per hectare, compared to \n1.51 for TV. During the last three decades, both saw a steady upward trend, with MV\u2019s \nproductivity increasing to 3 metric tons per hectare in 1999 and TV\u2019s to 2.13. \n\nTable 3.

In 1999, about 97 percent \nof the production was consumed as food. There are two sources of rice: local production \nand imports. During the last ten years, local production has become less and less able to \nmeet  local  demand  because  of  high  population  growth.  Thus,  rice  imports  increased \nfrom 412,000 metric tons in 1990 to 757,000 metric tons in 1999. There was, however, \na blip in 1998, due largely to the sharp drop in palay rice production because of El Nino.  \nIn 1998, imported rice amounted to 1,856,000 metric tons. \n \n \n\nTable 5.

The structure changed dramatically over time. \nIn 1997, 46 percent of palay rice production of farm households was sold on the market, \nwhile the share for personal food consumption dropped to 29 percent. This trend implies \nthat  palay  rice  activities  have  become  market  oriented,  and  therefore  increasingly \nvulnerable to market changes. \n\nTable 6.

For the years where data are available, the gap \nhas more than doubled. For example, in 1988 the farmgate price of ordinary palay rice \nwas P3.2 per kilo, while the wholesale price of the same variety was P7.2 per kilo. The \nlatter is 2.25 times (or 125 percent) higher than the former. There are no data available \nfor the retail price of ordinary rice for the same year, but the data in the following year \nindicate a price of P7.9 per kilo, a figure 2.48 times higher (or 148 percent).  In 2001, \nthe gap is still more than double.  The price gaps are much higher for high-quality rice. \n\n \nThe retail price of rice in the local market is largely determined by the QR on \nrice  imports,  which  limits  the  flow  of  imported  rice  and  artificially  creates  a  scarcity \nrent  that  jacks  up  the  local  price,  as  theoretically  depicted  below.  Meanwhile,  actual \ndata indicate that the gap between local prices of rice and world prices is large indeed. \nTake  the  case  of  the  retail  price  of  ordinary  rice  and  the  world  price  of  rice  for  35 \npercent broken, which are comparable in terms of quality. The gap has widened from 20 \npercent in 1989 to 130 percent in 2001.  \n\n3.  Food and Poverty \n\nAbout half of rural households live below poverty, while one-fifth of urban households \nfall  below  the  poverty  threshold  (Table  10).  More  than  60  percent  of  expenditure  of \nrural poor households is on food; about half is on cereals, consisting of rice and corn, \nwith the former having a much larger share. An almost similar structure is observed in \nthe  expenditure  pattern  of  urban  poor  households.  Furthermore,  rural  and  urban  poor \nhouseholds\u2014landless  agricultural  laborers,  small-scale  farmers,  and  urban  unskilled \nworkers\u2014are principally net buyers of rice (David and Otsuka (1994)). These indicate \nthat policy reforms on rice may have a significant impact on the consumption pattern of \nboth rural and urban poor households, and therefore on poverty. \n\n      9\n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nn.a\n\nn.a\n\nn.a\n\nn.a\n\n3.5\n\nn.a\n\n4.6\n\n5.1\n\nn.a\n\nn.a\n\nn.a\n\n8.0\n\n8.1\n\n10.3\n\n9.9\n\n10.7\n\n11.1\n\nn.a\n\n11.0\n\n1983\n\n1984\n\n1985\n\n1986\n\n1987\n\n1988\n\n1989\n\n1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\nTable 9: Palay and Rice Prices\n\nTable 9.

CGE Model \n\nThis section discusses the basic structure of the model. It introduces modifications to the \nbasic  structure  to  adequately  address  the  issues  in  the  paper.  In  particular,  the \nagriculture module is modified to allow the use of land and water in production. Rice \nimportation is augmented to include the import quota. The fertilizer price formation is \nmodified to allow for a government subsidy. Trading in both palay and rice is expanded \nto  accommodate  NFA\u2019s  buffer  stock  management,  which  allows  the  setting  of  a  rice \nprice ceiling for consumers and a palay price floor for farmers. \n\n4.1.  Basic Structure \n\nA CGE model is used to carry out the analysis in the paper. An overview of the basic \nstructure of the model is given below. \n\n \nFigure  2  presents  the  basic  price  and  volume  relationships  in  the  model.  The \nmodel specifies  a transformation function between exports (E) and domestic sales (D) \nusing  constant  elasticity  of  transformation  (CET).  If  the  export  price  (Pe)  increases \nrelative  to  the  local  price  (Pl),  then  export  supply  will  increase  while  supply  for \ndomestic sales will decline. The supply side of the model assumes profit maximization. \nThe  first-order  conditions  for  profit  maximization  generate  the  necessary  supply \nfunctions and input demand functions. \n\n \n \n \n\nFigure 2. The Basic Model \n\nExport volume (E)  \n\n                   \n                     (Constant elasticity of transformation, CET) \n\nOutput \nvolume (X) \n\nDomestic sales (D) \n\n \n \n \n \n            (Constant elasticity of substitution, CES) \n \n                              \n \nPrices: \nOutput price :       Px\u22c5X = Pe\u22c5E  +  Pl\u22c5D, where Pl is local prices \nExport price:        Pe = Pwe\u22c5er, where Pwe is world price of exports and er is exchange rate \nDomestic price:    Pd = Pl\u22c5(1 + itx), where itx is indirect tax rate \nImport price:        Pm = Pwm\u22c5er\u22c5 ( 1+ tm) \u22c5 (1 + itx), Pwm is world price of imports and tm is tariff rate \nComposite price:  Pq\u22c5Q = Pd\u22c5D + Pm\u22c5M \n\nComposite good (Q) \n\nImport volume (M) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      11\n\n\fOn  the  demand  side,  substitution  is  specified  between  imports  and  domestic \ngoods using a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. In the CGE literature, \nthis  substitution  can  also  be  interpreted  as  product  differentiation,  where  imports  and \ndomestically produced goods are treated as imperfect substitutes. If the import price in \nlocal  currency  (Pm)  declines  relative  to  domestic  price  (Pd),  the  demand  for  imports \nwill increase while demand for local goods will decline. The first-order conditions for \ncost minimization generate the import and domestic demand functions.  \n\n \nOutput  price  (Px)  is  the  composite  of  export  price  (Pe)  and  local  prices  (Pl). \nIndirect  taxes  are  added  to  the  local  price  to  determine  domestic  prices  (Pd),  which \ntogether  with  import  price  (Pm)  will  determine  the  composite  commodity  price  (Pq). \nThe composite price is the price paid by the consumers. \n\n \nThe import price (Pm) is denominated in domestic currency, and is affected by \nthe world price of imports, exchange rate (er), tariff rate (tm), and indirect tax rate (itx). \nThe direct effect of a tariff reduction, for example, is a reduction in Pm. If the reduction \nin Pm is significant enough, the composite price (Pq) will also decline. \n\n \nHouseholds maximize utility based on a linear expenditure system (LES). The \nrelationship for intermediate demand assumes a set of fixed Leontief coefficients. The \nmodel consists of a one-period (static) set of relationships. Sectoral capital, as well as \nlabor supply, is fixed. Furthermore, it assumes that total savings are invested.  \n\n \nThe macroeconomic closure is as follows: \n \nTotal (E\u2212M) = Total (S\u2212I) + Total (Tx\u2212G)  \n \n\nwhere E is total exports of goods and services, M is total imports of goods and services, \nS  is  total  private  savings,  I  is  total  private  investment,  Tx  is  total  government  income \nand G is total government expenditure.  \n\n \nThe total (E\u2212M), which is the external balance, is assumed to be fixed. This is \nalso  equivalent  to  assuming  constant  foreign  savings.  However,  sectoral  exports  and \nimports are not fixed. They respond to changes in the relative price ratio between Pe and \nPl, which is the real exchange rate. The nominal exchange rate, er, is fixed. \n\n \nThe  total  (S\u2212I),  which  represents  the  private  sector  balance,  is  solved  in  the \nmodel.  The  total  (Tx\u2212G),  which  is  the  government  balance,  is  closed  using  various \nclosure  rules  that  are  discussed  in  detail  below.  However,  in  all  the  macroeconomic \nclosure rules that are applied, government expenditure remains fixed.  \n\n4.2.  Modifications \n\nAgricultural Production. The basic model as described above uses equality constraints. \nHowever,  this  may  be  inadequate  if  applied  to  issues  pertaining  to  agriculture.  For \nexample,  land  and  water  inputs  may  not  be  as  substitutable  as  capital  and  labor  in  a \nwell-behaved  production  function.  Often,  they  are  used  in  fixed  proportions.  In  a \n\n      12\n\n\fnumbers  of  instances,  land  and  water  may  not  be  paid  according  to  their  marginal \nproduct  contributions,  or  may  not  even  be  paid  at  all.  Highly  seasonal  agriculture \nproduction results in the underutilization of land and water during certain periods of a \ngiven  year.  Thus,  inequality  constraints  are  more  appropriate  in  modeling  agriculture \n(Hazell and Norton (1986)).  \n\n \nFigure  3  shows  how  the  agricultural  module  of  the  model  is  re-specified. \nSimilar  to  the  basic  model,  output  is  a  linear  combination  of  value  added  and \nintermediate  inputs,  with  the  latter  determined  by  a  set  of  fixed  Leontief  coefficients. \nHowever, this added time value is a CES combination of three factor inputs: capital, an \naggregate  labor  input,  and  an  aggregate  land  and  water  input.  Capital  is  fixed,  while \naggregate  labor  is  specified  as  a  nested  CES  function  of  skilled  and  unskilled  labor. \nFollowing Robinson and Gehlhar (1996) the aggregate land and water input is specified \nas a nested linear combination of land and water.   \n \n \n\nFigure 3.

Basically, a model based on MCP contains \na system of simultaneous equations (linear or nonlinear), which are a mixture of strict \nequalities and inequalities. The system works in such a way that each of the inequalities \nis  linked  with  a  bounded  variable  in  a  complementary-slackness  relationship \n(Rutherford  (1995)).  The  basic  idea  is  similar  to  the  Kuhn-Tucker  necessary  and \nsufficient conditions for optimality. \n\n      13\n\n\fThe agriculture production sector module in the revised model is specified as \nMCP. The details are presented in Table 11. Equation (1) is the value added (VA) CES \nfunction of three factor inputs: an aggregate labor (L), capital (K), and aggregate input \nconsisting of land and water (LW). \u03c1 is a substitution parameter, \u03ba is a scale parameter \nand  \u03c9  are  factor  weights.  Equation  (2)  is  a  nested  aggregate  labor  CES  function  of \nskilled (Ls) and unskilled labor (Lu). Like (1), this equation has 3 sets of parameters (\u03d5, \n\u03b2,  \u03c8).  Equations  (3)  and  (4)  are  demand  functions  for  land  (LN)  and  water  (WA), \nrespectively, which are linearly related to (LW) using fixed coefficients (\u03b1). \n\n \nEquation (5) is the demand for the aggregate labor function, which is the first-\norder condition of profit maximization using the production function in (1). Pva is the \nvalue  added  price.  Equation  (6)  is  the  first-order  condition  for  cost  minimization  with \n(2) as the production constraint. This equation yields the demand functions for the two \ntypes  of  labor.  Equation  (7)  gives  the  average  wage  (w),  which  is  the  average  of  the \nwage for skilled labor (ws) and unskilled labor (wu). \n\n \nEquations (8) to (13) are a set of relationships that capture the complementary \nslackness  conditions  for  optimization  involving  land  and  water.  In  particular,  the \nconditions  involve  the  relationship  between  the  overall  rent  for  the  use  of  land  and \nwater, and their demand and supply situation. Like (5), Equation (8) is the demand for \naggregate  LW,  and  is  derived  as  one  of  the  first-order  conditions  for  profit \nmaximization. Equation (9) is the average rent for the use of (LW). It is the weighted \naverage of the rent for land use and the rent for water use. However, both the rents for \nland  use  and  water  use  have  two  components:  (rln  +  rln_p)  for  land  use  and  (rwa  + \nrwa_p) for  water  use.  The variables with the suffix _p signify the rent when land and \nwater constraints are not binding. In this case these variables have a value of 1 when the \nsupply of both water (WAS) and land (LNS) are greater than the corresponding demand. \nThese  are  presented  in  Equations  (10)  and  (11).  When  the  constraints  are  binding, \nhowever, the overall rent for land use is (rln + rl_p) and for water use (rwa + rwa_p). \nThe economic interpretation for this is that when the constraint is binding, the shadow \nprice for the use of the resource is higher. Thus, if in agriculture the supply of water is \nbinding, the overall cost of  production  is  higher. If the water supply is increased (e.g. \nimprovements in irrigation are carried out), this relaxes the constraints and reduces the \ncost of production. Equations (12) and (13) are the demand for land and water.4 \n\n \nEquation  (14)  is  the  zero-profit  condition,  which  is  required  in  competitive \nequilibrium models. It shows that value added is fully used to pay for the use of capital \n(r\u22c5K),  labor  (w\u22c5L)  and  land  and  water.  Lastly,  Equations  (15)  and  (16)  determine  the \nmarket for skilled and unskilled labor. \n\n                                                 \n4 For a detailed discussion see Robinson and Gehlhar (1995)  \n\n      14\n\n\fTable 11.

There are complicated issues to deal with when modeling import \nquotas  (Francois  and  Reinert  [1997]).  In  their  paper,  the  import  quota  is  viewed  as  a \nprice distortion effect. If the domestic price of a good that is under an import quota is \ncompared  with  its  equivalent  world  price,  then  the  price  distortion  effect  of  the  quota \ncan be computed. In the literature, this is called the price-gap method of estimating the \ntariff-equivalent of a quota, which is analogous to an ad valorem tariff rate.  \n\n \nFigure 4 shows the theoretical framework for modeling the import quota. The \nvertical  axis  shows  the  local  price  of  imports,  while  the  horizontal  axis  is  the  import \n\n      15\n\n\fvolume.  The  import  demand  is  downward  sloping.  The  small  country  assumption  is \nused in the analysis. This means that supply is perfectly elastic at a given world price of \nimports. If there is no import distortion, imports will be at M1. The corresponding price \nof imports is Pm1, which is the world price (Pwm) converted into domestic prices using \nthe exchange rate (er). If a tariff (tm) is introduced, then import volume falls to M2. The \nprice  of  imports  will  be  Pm2.  When  imported  goods  are  sold  in  the  domestic  market, \nthey  face  an  additional  indirect  tax  (itx)  similar  to  other  domestic  goods  sold  in  the \nmarket. In this case, the import volume is reduced to M3, while the price is increased to \nPm3. \n\n \nFurthermore,  if  imports  are  restricted  by  a  quota,  say  at  M4,  then  the \ncorresponding  price  will  be  higher.  Thus,  on  top  of  the  tariff  rate  and  the  indirect  tax \nrate, there is an additional price mark-up due to the scarcity premium, which we call rr. \nThe final local market price of imports will be Pm4. This distortion will generate three \ntypes of revenue: tariff revenue, (Pm2 \u2013 Pm1) \u00d7 M4, and the indirect tax revenue, (Pm3 \u2013 \nPm2) \u00d7 M4, both of which will go to the government, and the quota rent, (Pm4 \u2013 Pm3) \u00d7 \nM4,  which  will  go  to  the  holder  of  the  import  rights.  This  analysis  of  the  quota  is \nmodeled as MCP, and presented in Table 12. \n\n \nEquation  (17)  is  a  CES  aggregation  of  imported  (M)  and  domestically \nproduced commodities (D). The resulting good is called the composite commodity (Q). \nThis  equation  captures  product  differentiation  between  (M)  and  (D).  Equation  (18)  is \nthe first-order condition for cost minimization with (17) as the constraint. This equation \nyields  the  demand  for  imports.  Thus,  if  the  import  price  (Pm)  decreases  relative  to \ndomestic  prices  (Pd),  imports  will  increase  relative  to  domestically  produced  goods. \nEquation (19) gives the domestic price of imports inclusive of tariffs (tm), indirect tax \n(itx), and import quota scarcity premium (rr).   \n\n \n \n\n      16\n\n\fFigure 4.

Equation  (21)  is  the  domestic  price \n(Pd) inclusive of indirect taxes. The local price before the indirect tax is (Pl),  the cost of \nproduction  of  domestically  produced  goods.  Equations  (22)  and  (23)  give  a \ncomplementary  slackness  relationship  between  the  import  quota  scarcity  premium  (rr) \nand the quota rent (Re). If the quota is not binding, then (rr) is zero; otherwise it has a \npositive value. \n\n \nEquation (24) shows the consumer price (Pc) equal to the composite price (Pq). \nThus, if (rr) is positive, (Pq) will be higher, and so will be (Pc). Equations (25) and (26) \nallocate  the  quota  rent  to  the  holders  of  import  rights.  In  the  case  of  the  Philippines, \nNFA  is  the  major  holder  of  quota  rights.  However, it issues a very limited number of \nimport licenses to private importers. Thus, household income (25) will increase by its \nshare in the quota rent, while government income will also increase by its share in the \n\n      17\n\n\frent.  The  other  components  of  household  income  (Yh)  consist  of  factor  incomes, \ntransfers  and  other  incomes.  The  other  components  of  government  income  (Yg)  are \nrevenues from taxation, and other incomes. \n \n \n\nTable 12.

Fertilizer is an industrial \ninput  that  is  used  heavily  in  agricultural  production.  It  is  also  critical  to  palay  rice \nproduction,  as  presented  in  Table  7.  One  policy  instrument  that  may  be  used  in \nsupporting  agriculture  is  a  fertilizer  price  subsidy.  In  this  model,  the  price  subsidy  is \nalso specified as MCP as in Robinson, et al (1997). The relationships are presented in \nTable 13.  \n \n \n\nTable 13.

It is the composite price \n(Pq)  of  imported  and  domestically  produced  inputs.  To  make  it  more  general,  it  is \nfurther augmented to include a consumption tax (tc) for the use of the input and price \nsubsidy (spc). The ceiling on price is in Equation (28). In this equation, if the input price \n(Pc) exceeds the ceiling price (Pc*), then the price subsidy (spc) will be positive. The \nmodel  will  search  for  the  value  of  the  price  subsidy  that  will  retain  the  inequality  in \n(28). \n\n \nOne should note that the price subsidy is introduced not on the production side, \nbut in consumption. Furthermore, the subsidy changes the relative sectoral consumption \nprice, i.e. \n \nEquation  (29)  gives  the  effect  of  the  price  subsidy  on  the  income  of  the \ngovernment. If the subsidy is positive, it will entail a reduction in government income. \nEquation (30) is the augmented government income. \n\n for sector i \u2260 j \n\npc\npc\n\n \n\nj\n\ni\n\n \nPrice  Ceiling,  Price  Floor,  and  Buffer  Stock  Management.  One  of  the  key \ngovernment  interventions  in  rice  activities  in  the  Philippines  is  the  setting  of  a  price \nceiling to protect consumers, the setting of price floors to protect rice farmers, and the \nmaintenance of a buffer stock to assure an adequate supply of rice. All these are done \nthrough NFA. In the model, this mechanism is specified as MCP as in Robinson et al \n(1997) and presented in Table 14. \n \n \n\n \n\nTable 14.

Equation  (33)  sets  the  lower  bound  of  NFA\u2019s  buffer  stock  of \nrice,  while  Equation  (34)  sets  the  upper  bound.  Equation  (35)  is  the  buffer  stock \nequation  of  NFA.  If  the  farmgate  price  of  palay  (Px)  goes  below  the  set  price  floor \n(Pxf*), then NFA will start buying palay (N_buy) to support the farmers. The support \nbuying is an artificial demand and will continue until the inequality in (31) is recovered. \nHowever, these support buying activities will increase the level of the buffer stock.5 In \nthe  product  market  equilibrium  equation  in  (36),  the  support  buying  by  the  NFA \neffectively increases the overall demand for the commodity (demand elements come in \nas  positive  in  the  right-hand  side  of  the  equation).  Also,  since  NFA  is  a  government \nagency, its support buying of palay means additional expenditures for the government, \nas shown in Equation (38). \n\n \nOn the other hand, if the consumer price of rice exceeds the set price ceiling, \nNFA will sell rice (N_sel) to the general public to increase the supply of rice artificially. \nThe  selling  of  rice  will  persist  until  the  inequality  in  (32)  is  recovered.  However,  the \nselling of rice to the domestic market drains the buffer stock level of NFA in (35). If the \nselling  continues  and  violates  (33),  i.e.,  the  buffer  stock  level  goes  below  the  critical \nlevel set by (N_stkl*), then NFA will start importing rice (N_m) to replenish the amount \nof rice sold onto the market. These rice imports will be reflected in the current account \nbalance  in  Equation  (37).  Furthermore,  the  government  will  have  to  pay  for  this \nimported  rice  as  shown  in  Equation  (38).  A  similar  mechanism  will  occur,  but  in  the \nreverse  direction,  if  the  buffer  stock  exceeds  the  upper  bound  as  a  result  of  heavy \nsupport  buying  of  palay.  The  government  then  has  to  export  the  excess  stock  of  rice, \nwhich  will  in  turn  generate  revenue.  Exports  of  rice  will  be  reflected  in  the  current \naccount balance. \n \nThe  model  is  programmed  with  the  GAMS  (General  Algebraic  Modelling \nSystem).  The  model  is  solved  using  the  solver  called  MILES  (Mixed  Inequality  and \nnonLinear Equation Solver).6 \n\n4.3.  Base Model Structure, Parameters, and Elasticities  \n\nThe production sector is disaggregated into 15 sectors, with 6 agricultural sub-sectors, 6 \nindustrial sub-sectors, and 3 service sectors. Palay rice production is disaggregated into \nirrigated  and  non-irrigated  production.  Corn  also  has  a  separate  sector.  In  the \nmanufacturing sub-sector, \u2018rice and corn milling\u2019 is a separate sector as well. However, \nthere is no information available to break up these into two separate milling activities. \nFertilizer has a separate sector because of its importance to agricultural production. The \n1994  Input-Output  (IO)  table  is  the  source  of  basic  data  on  sectoral  production  and \nproduction technology. \n\n \nThe model incorporates two types of labor: agricultural and production labor. \nAgricultural labor is devoted only to the agricultural sector. However, production labor \n                                                 \n5 In the model 65% of palay milled comes out as final rice. \n6 The model is coded in GAMS and is available from the author upon request.  \n\n      20\n\n\fcan  work  in  both  agriculture  and  non-agriculture  sectors.  Furthermore,  there  are  two \nclasses  of  labor  within  each  type:  skilled  and  unskilled.  Skilled  labor  includes \nprofessionals, managers, and other related workers with at least a high school diploma. \nThe rest are unskilled. The Labor Force Survey (LFS) is the source of basic information \non labor types and classes. \n\nTable 15.

There  are  six  urban  household  groups  and  six  rural  household  groups,  each \ncategory  being  broken  down  according  to  the  type  of  occupation  and  the  level  of \neducation  of  the  head  of  the  family,  which  is  consistent  with  the  classes  and  types  of \nlabor described above. The 1994 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) is the \nsource of information on households. \n\n \nTable 16 presents some of the characteristics of the household groups. Among \nurban  household  groups,  urb1  has  the  lowest  per  capita  income,  followed  by  urb4. \nWhile  both  groups  have  a  low  level  of  education,  the  former  is  employed  while  the \nlatter is self-employed. Households in the informal urban sector and the unemployed are \nincluded  in  the  latter.  The  highest  poverty  indicators  (headcount,  gap,  and  severity) \namong urban households are found in these two groups.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      21\n\n\fTable 16.

In general, the \nFGT poverty measure is7  \n\nw n=\u2211\n\nj\n\nj\n\ni\n\ni\n\n \n\n                                                 \n7 See Ravallion (1992) for a detailed discussion.  \n\nP\n\u03b1\n\n=\n\n1\nn\n\nq\n\n\u2211\n\ni=1\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\ni\n\nz - y\nz\n\n\u03b1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n \n\n      24\n\n\fwhere n is population size, q is number of people below the poverty line, yi is income, z \nis the poverty threshold. The poverty threshold is equal to the food threshold plus the \nnon-food  threshold,  where  threshold  refers  to  the  cost  of  basic  food  and  non-food \nrequirements. The parameter \u03b1 can have three values, each one indicating a measure of \npoverty.  The  headcount  index  of  poverty  has  \u03b1  =  0.  This  is  the  common  index  of \npoverty,  which  measures  the  proportion  of  the  population  whose  income  (or \nconsumption) falls below the poverty threshold. The poverty gap index has \u03b1 = 1. This \nmeasures the depth of poverty in the sense that it indicates how far below on average the \npoor are from the poverty threshold. The poverty severity index has \u03b1 = 2. This measure \nis sensitive to the distribution among the poor, as more weight is given to those furthest \nbelow the poverty threshold. This is because the poverty severity index corresponds to \nthe  squared  average  distance  of  income  of  the  poor  from  the  poverty  line,  and  hence \ngives more weight to the poorest of the poor in the population. \n\n \nTo capture the extent of poverty before the policy experiment on rice reform, \nactual household income and the poverty line from the 1994 FIES were used to compute \nthe  FGT  indices.  These  indices  serve  as  the  base  in  the  analysis.  Households  were \ngrouped according to the classification in Table 15. \n\n \nThe  policy  experiment  using  the  CGE  model  generates  the  change  in  the \naverage  income  of  the  representative  household  groups  defined  in  Table  15.  These \naverage  income  changes  are  applied  to  the  actual  household  income  in  the  FIES  to \ndetermine the impact of the policy on household income. \n\n \n The CGE simulation also generates the change in the consumer price of goods \ndefined  in  the  model.  The  consumption  weights  of  each  household  group  in  Table  17 \nwere  used  to  calculate  the  weighted  consumer  price  of  each  of  the  groups.  The \ncomputed  change  in  the  weighted  consumer  price  was  used  to  compute  the  nominal \nchange in the poverty line after the policy experiment. In particular, the actual poverty \n,  where  Z0  is  the  poverty  threshold,  P0  the \nthreshold  at  the  base  is  set  at \n0X  is the \u2018minimum basic needs\u2019. The \u2018minimum basic needs\u2019 are \nconsumer price, and \nassumed to be fixed before and after the policy experiment.  \n\nP X\n\u00d7\n0\n\nZ\n\n=\n\n0\n\n0\n\n \nThe new poverty threshold is computed by replacing P0 with a new price that is \nderived using the results for the weighted consumer price from the CGE model. That is, \nZ\n where Z1 is the new poverty threshold and P1 is the new price derived using \n1\nthe  results  from  the  CGE  simulation.  Since  the  \u2018minimum  basic  needs\u2019  are  assumed \nfixed, in effect this process changes the nominal value of the poverty threshold. \n\nP X\n\u00d7\n1\n\n=\n\n0\n\n \nThe  change  in  household  income  and  the  change  in  the  nominal  value  of  the \npoverty threshold after the policy experiment generate a new set of FGT indices These \nare compared with the FGT at the base to determine whether a policy change is poverty-\nimproving or not. \n\n      25\n\n\f6.

The first is the setting of the QR \non imported rice. The QR is set so that the resulting local price of imported rice is 2.2 \ntimes (or 120 percent) the price without the QR. This is the average price gap over the \nperiod 1995-2001 (Table 9). The second step is the complete elimination of the QR and \nthe reduction of the tariff rates of palay and rice imports from 40 percent to 10 percent. \nThe solutions of the model in the first and second steps are compared to determine the \nimpact on resource allocation, household income and consumer prices.  \n\n \nGovernment income is fixed in the experiment. Thus, any loss in government \nrevenue from the implementation of the policy reform is compensated by an additional \nindirect  output  tax.  The  compensatory  indirect  output  tax  is  applied  in  the  following \nmanner \n\n \nPd\n \n\n=\n\nPl\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u00d7 +\n\n(1 itx\n\n[\n\u00d7 1+\n\n]\nntaxr )\n\n \n\ni\n\nwhere  Pdi  is  the  domestic  price  of  sector  i,  Pli  the  local  prices  before  taxes,  itxi  the \nindirect tax rate at the base, and ntaxr the endogenously determined compensatory tax. \nNote  that  ntaxr  in  this  case  introduces  two  effects:  (a)  it  creates  an  additional  wedge \n\n      26\n\n\fbetween  domestic  and  local  prices,  and  (b)  it  changes  the  relative  sectoral  domestic \n\nprice, i.e. \n\n for sector i \u2260 j. Both will generate inefficiency effects.  \n\nPd\nPd\n\ni\n\nj\n\n \nExperiment SIM_2 is similar to the first except that the direct income tax rates \nof the following household groups: urb1, rur1 and rur4, are reduced by 50 percent as a \npoverty-offsetting measure. The loss in government revenue is offset by a compensatory \nindirect output tax similar to SIM_1. \n\n \nExperiment SIM_3 is also similar to the first except that government transfers \nto the following household groups: urb1, rur1 and rur4, are increased by 10 percent as a \npoverty-offsetting measure. Overall government balance is held fixed by introducing an \noffsetting compensatory indirect output tax similar to SIM_1. \n\n \nExperiment SIM_4 is also similar to the first except that the price of fertilizer \nis  subsidized  by  50  percent  by  the  government  as  a  poverty-offsetting  measure.  The \nprice  subsidy  specification  is  given  in  Table  13.  The  subsidy  is  financed  by  a \ncompensatory direct income tax, which is applied in the following manner \n\n \nDyh\n\n \n\n=\n\n(\nY 1 dtxr\n\u00d7 \u2212\nh\n\nh\n\n[\n1 ntaxr\n\u00d7 +\n\n]\n\n)\n\n \n\nh\n\nwhere Dyhh is the disposable income of household h, Yh is income, dtxrh is the direct \nincome  tax  rate  at  the  base,  and  ntaxr  is  the  compensatory  tax.8 The  price  subsidy  is \nnegative income for the government. When the subsidy is implemented, ntaxr will have \na  positive  value  until  total  government  income  is  maintained  at  a  specified  level.  A \npositive ntaxr will increase the direct income tax rate, which in turn will lead to higher \ngovernment  direct  tax  revenue  and  lower  household  disposable  income.  Note  further \nthat by design, the compensatory tax is progressive in the sense that the increase in the \ndirect  income  tax  is  higher  for  those  households  with  higher  direct  income  tax  rates, \ndtxrh.  Thus,  in  this  system  there  is  a  built-in  redistribution  effect  of  the  compensatory \ndirect income tax.9 \n \nExperiment SIM_5 is similar to SIM_4 except that the subsidy is financed by a \n\ncompensatory indirect output tax similar to SIM_1. \n\n6.2.

The  import  price  of  \u2018rice  and  corn  milling\u2019  in  local  currency  (\u03b4pmi)  drops \nsignificantly  by  \u201364  percent  as  a  result  of  the  removal  of  the  QR  (Table  21).

Therefore, the  compensatory direct  income  tax  is  not distortive  in  the \nsense that it does not affect relative commodity prices. \n9  Alternatively,  one  can  specify  a  compensatory  direct  income  tax  that  is  neutral  with  respect  to \ndistribution.  \n\n      27\n\n\f \n\nSectors \n\nIrrigated Palay\n\nNon_Irrigated Palay\n\nCorn\n\nSugarcane\n\nLivestock\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nOther Agriculture\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nFood Processing\n\nRice & Corn Milling /a/\n\nSugar Milling\n\nFertilizer\n\nOther manufacturing\n\nOther industry\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nTransportation\n\nOther Services\n\nGovernment Services\n\nSERVICES\n\nTOTAL\n\nwhere\n\nmi : imports\n\nei  : exports\n\ndi  : domestic sales\n\ntranslates into a surge in rice imports (\u03b4mi)  by  3,676  percent.10 On the other hand, the \nconsumer  prices  (\u03b4pci)  for  irrigated  palay,  non-irrigated  palay,  and  \u2018rice  and  corn \nmilling\u2019 decline by -4.1 percent, -3.2 percent, and -4.9 percent, respectively.

This  movement  of  resources  creates  inefficiency  in  resource \nallocation within the agriculture sector as well as in the rest of the economy. \n\n                                                 \n10 Although the increase is large, the share of rice imports remains relatively small compared to the share \nof domestic rice. \n11 The elasticity of substitution for these commodities is high at 3.7 (Table 19).

This  should  be  favorable  to  all  consumers  in  two  ways:  it \nincreases real consumption and reduces the nominal value of the poverty threshold, as \ndiscussed earlier.   \n \n \n\nTable 22.

Because of the drop in output and price of \npalay and rice, the demand for factors and the factor prices drop as well. For example, \nthe  return  to  capital  used  in  palay  production  and  in  \u2018rice  and  corn  milling\u2019  drops \nsignificantly relative to the other sectors (Table 22). The demand for labor also drops in \nthose sectors. Wages for agriculture labor and unskilled production workers decline by \n\u20131.7  and  \u20130.5  percent,  respectively.  Put  together,  these  effects  on  value  added  are \nunfavourable to the palay rice sector in general. \n\n*L1, L2, L3, & L4: Labor type 1, 2, 3, & 4\n\npvai  :  value added prices\n\n     ri  : return to capital\n\nSERVICES \n\nvai  :  value added\n\nAverage wage -->\n\nTOTAL\n\nwhere\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.10\n\n-1.68\n\n-1.68\n\n-0.30\n\n-0.70\n\n-0.50\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.09\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.19\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.28\n\n-0.14\n\n-0.50\n\n-0.10\n\n-0.43\n\n-0.46\n\n0.00\n\n0.20\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0.19\n\n0.02\n\n0.18\n\n0.07\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\n0.00\n\n0.13\n\n0.10\n\n0.00\n\n0.30\n\n0.57\n\n0.20\n\n0.38\n\n0.07\n\n \nThe  effects  on  income,  weighted  consumer  prices,  poverty  and  distribution \nacross  household  groups  are  summarized  in  Table  23.  Largely  because  of  the  drop  in \nfactor prices, overall household income declines as the QR is removed and the tariff on \nrice imports is reduced. Because this drop is mainly caused by the surge in rice imports, \n\n      29\n\n\fit can be thought of as a displacement effect. The largest drop is observed in households \nin  rur1  (\u22121.4  percent),  followed  by  rur4  (\u22120.97  percent),  and  ur1  (\u22120.94  percent). \nThese  households  are  highly  dependent  on  factor  incomes  derived  from  agriculture \n(Table  18).  Furthermore,  these  household  groups  have  the  lowest  per  capita  income \n(Table 16). Thus, the impact worsens the income inequality problem as indicated by the \nincrease of 0.24 percent in the Gini coefficient.   \n\nTable 23.

However,  the  drop  in  consumer  prices  is  not  significant  enough  to \ncounter the negative income effects on critical households with a very high incidence of \npoverty, or the poorest of the poor. For example, the headcount index for rur1 increases \nby 0.3 percent, for rur4 by 0.15 percent, and for urb1 by 0.11 percent. The worsening \nof poverty in these groups can also be observed from the larger increases in the poverty \ngap  and  severity  indices.  As  these  indices  give  more  distributional  weight  to  those \nfurthest below the poverty threshold, the average income of the poor in those household \ngroups  has  moved  further  away  from  the  poverty  threshold.  This  also  means  that  the \ndegree of their poverty has increased as the QR on rice is eliminated and tariff on rice \nimports is reduced. \n \nOn the whole, while the overall poverty headcount drops, the elimination of the \nQR and the reduction of the tariff on rice imports can be described as generally not pro-\npoor. It also worsens the income inequality problem. The drop in consumer prices is not \nsignificant  enough  to  mitigate  the  negative  effect  on  income,  especially  in  household \n\n      30\n\n\fgroups  where  the  problem  of  poverty  is  severe.  The  next  four  experiments  implement \npolicy  measures  that  can  offset  the  negative  poverty  effects  on  households  that  are \nadversely affected, particularly urb1, rur1, and rur4. \n\n6.2.2.  \n\nQR Removal, Tariff Reduction, and Poverty-Offsetting Measures \n\nTable 24 summarizes the results of the experiments where the removal of the QR and \nthe reduction in the tariff on rice imports are accompanied by various poverty-offsetting \nmeasures.

It shows a favorable \neffect  on  overall  poverty  as  the  three  poverty  indices  indicate  negative  changes. \nHowever, no improvement is observed for rur1, which is the poorest household. This is \nbecause this group has an almost zero direct tax rate, and thus a 50 percent reduction in \nthe  rate  does  not  make  any  difference.  Thus,  the  poverty  situation  for  this  group \ndeteriorates.  Income  distribution  also  worsens  as  indicated by  the  increase  in  the  Gini \ncoefficient,  because  the  poorest  household  group  is  not  favorably  affected  while  the \nother groups are. \n  \nSIM_3  involves  a  10  percent  increase  in  government  transfers  to  the  three \ngroups,  financed  by  a  compensatory  indirect  output  tax.  The  overall  improvement  in \npoverty is better here than in the previous case, as indicated by a larger reduction in all \npoverty indices. The largest improvement is observed in rur1 because, being the poorest \ngroup, it receives a larger amount of government transfer. Thus, a 10 percent increase \n\n      31\n\n\fhas a greater benefit on this group than on the other two. Also, there is an improvement \nin distribution as indicated by a reduction in the Gini coefficient. \n\n \nSIM_4  involves  a  50  percent  fertilizer  price  subsidy  by  the  government \nfinanced by a progressive compensatory direct income tax. This experiment also brings \nabout  a  favorable  poverty  effect  as  the  three  indices  show  reductions  for  the  three \ngroups.  Income  distribution  also  improves.  However,  the  improvement  in  poverty  and \ndistribution is lower than in SIM_3.  \n\n \nSIM_5  also  involves  a  50  percent  fertilizer  price  subsidy  by  the  government. \nHowever,  the  subsidy  is  financed  by  a  compensatory  indirect  output  tax,  which  as \nshown  earlier  creates  distortionary  effects.  The  results  indicate  that  while  the  overall \npoverty  as  well  as  the  poverty  for  the  three  groups  improves,  the  effect  is  lower \ncompared to SIM_4. This is because the increase in the indirect tax creates an additional \nwedge between the Pd and Pl in all commodities. Thus, it reduces the full price effects \nof  the  removal  of  the  QR,  the  reduction  in  the  tariff,  and  the  fertilizer  price  subsidy. \nThis additional price wedge is not created in SIM_4. \n\n \nThus, the results of the experiments indicate that the policy that would lead to \nhigher  poverty-offsetting  effects  for  the  three  poorest  household  groups  that  are \nadversely  affected  by  market  reforms  in  rice  is  an  increase  in  the  direct  government \ntransfers to these groups. \n\n7.  Conclusion and Policy Recommendation \n\nThe QR on rice will be phased out by the end of 2004. While this policy reform may be \njustified for efficiency purposes,12 the displacement effects of the expected surge in rice \nimports  will  translate  into  larger  negative  income  effects  for  household  groups  where \nthe  problem  of  poverty  is  most  severe.  This  is  because  these  groups  rely  heavily  on \nagriculture,  particularly  palay  rice  production,  which  is  expected  to  contract  when  the \nQR is removed and the tariff is reduced. As a result, factor demand and factor prices in \nagriculture will drop. Factor incomes derived from agricultural production will decline \nas  well.  While  all  household  groups  will  enjoy  reduced  prices  of  rice  as  the  QR  is \nremoved  and  the  tariff  reduced,  the  drop  in  consumer  prices  will  not  be  significant \nenough  to  mitigate  the  decline  in  income  for  those  groups  that  are  adversely  affected. \nThus, all poverty indicators for these groups show higher values, indicating a worsening \nof  their  poverty  situation.  Furthermore,  the  overall  Gini  coefficient  increases,  which \nindicates a worsening of income inequality.  \n\n \nThe  policy  lesson  that  may  be  drawn  from  this  exercise  is  that  while  market \nreform  is  generally  necessary,  it  has  to  be  carried  out  carefully,  especially  if \nimplemented on a critical commodity such as rice. Although market reforms in rice can \npotentially  have  favorable  effects  on  consumer  prices  in  general,  some  household \ngroups  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  expected  surge  in  rice  imports.  Policy \n                                                 \n12  It  has  been  established  numerically  in  the  paper  that  resource  allocation  favors  palay  and  rice \nproduction over \u2018other agricultural crops\u2019 under a regime of rice protection. \n\n      32\n\n\fmeasures may have to be designed to counter these effects. Among the various poverty-\noffsetting measures experimented with in the paper, the results indicate that an increase \nin  direct  government  transfers  to  the  adversely  affected  household  groups    provides  a \nbetter  safety  net.  However,  this  is  more  of  a  short-run  policy  measure.  Other  policy \nmeasures  that  may  have  favorable  longer-term  implications  include  productivity \nimprovement  through  a  vigorous  program  of  intensified  use  of  high-yielding  rice \nvarieties, irrigation, better farm-to-market roads, and measures to encourage the growth \nof other non-rice crops. \n\n \n\n      33\n\n\fReferences \n\nAsian Development Bank (1999). \u201cReport and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard  of  Governors  on  Proposed  Loans  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Grains Sector Development Program\u201d.

The Gini coefficient rises as well. \n", "In general, these results imply that the poorest of the poor are adversely affected.  \n", "In  particular,  while  market  reforms  in  rice  bring  about  a  reduction  in  consumer  prices \n", "that is favorable to all, imports of rice surge and generate displacement effects on poor households \n", "that  rely  heavily  on  agriculture  for  factor  incomes,  particularly on  palay  rice  production  and  other \n", "related activities.
