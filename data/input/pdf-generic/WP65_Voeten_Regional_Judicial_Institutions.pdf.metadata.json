What \nlessons  from  the  operation  of  such  institutions  elsewhere  could  be  valuable  to  Asian \nregional economic integration? I show that Asian states are not unusually averse to refer \ninter-state  disputes  over  trade,  investment,  and  territory  to  global  judicial  institutions. \nMoreover, Asian  states are  not  unique  in their  reluctance to resolve regional  inter-state \ndisputes through judicial means: Regional judicial institutions elsewhere have also rarely \nbeen  used  to  resolve  inter-state  disputes.  The  most  valuable  lesson  for  Asia  from \nexperiences  elsewhere  is  the  role  that  regional  courts  can  play  in  resolving  disputes \nbetween  administrative  agencies  and  private  parties  about  the  implementation  of \ninternational law. While Asia lacks an extensive set of regional laws and regulations that \ncreate rights and obligations for private parties, there is a broad body of international law \nthat already applies in many Asian countries. National administrative agencies or courts \nmay not always be well-equipped to interpret this law. I suggest the creation of a regional \njudicial institution that contributes to the uniform application of this law and that may help \nsignal  the  commitment  of  states  to  their  international  obligations.  The  proposed \ninstitution  provides  incentives  for  harmonization  without  creating  new  obligations,  thus \nrecognizing the diversity among Asian states. \n \nKeywords: regional judicial institutions, regional economic integration, Asia \n \nJEL Classification: F50, F51, F53, F55 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       1 \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \n \nThe absence of regional judicial institutions in Asia is one of the most striking differences \nbetween its regional economic integration projects and those elsewhere. While Asia has \nno active standing regional court, Europe, Latin America, and Africa each have at least \nfour  active  regional  courts  that  have  issued  thousands  of  legally  binding  judgments.1 \nAbout  90%  of  these  judgments  have  come  since  1990  (Alter  2009).  This  increased \nusage stems  not  just  from  Europe  but  also from  the  Americas  and  even  Africa.  These \ntrends  are  backed  by  an  emerging  consensus  on  the  centrality  of  legal  institutions  for \neconomic development (e.g. Dixit 2009).  \n \nWhy  is  Asia  lagging  behind  other  regions  in  this  regard?  And,  what  is  Asian  regional \neconomic integration and cooperation missing by not partaking in this trend? This paper \nfirst  discusses  the  theoretical  reasons  why  regional  judicial  institutions  could  enhance \neconomic  integration  and  cooperation.  It  then  turns  to  the  question  why  Asian  regional \ncooperation projects have decided (until now) to forego these theoretical advantages. A \nprevalent  hypothesis  among  scholars  and  policymakers  is  that  Asia  has  opted  for  a \nmodel of cooperation without legalization because Asian states are inherently averse to \nlegalized  dispute  resolution  for  cultural  or  institutional  reasons.    So  far,  however,  this \nproposition  has  not  been  systematically  tested.  Using  data  and  models  from  studies \npublished  in  top  peer-reviewed  journals,  I  find  no  evidence  that  Asian  states  are  less \nlikely than other states to refer trade, investment, or territorial disputes to global judicial \ninstitutions. This also holds for inter-Asian disputes. \n \nA  slightly  different  argument  is  that  Asian  regional  cooperation  projects  have  a  distinct \nsocial  logic  that  prescribe  consensual  as  opposed  to  legalized  forms  of  dispute \nresolution between states. This is, however, mostly based on a misconception about the \nnature  of  regional  integration  elsewhere.  While  regional  inter-state  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms  are  ubiquitous,  they  are  rarely  used  by  states  involved  in  a  regional \nintegration  project.  Resolving  inter-state  disputes  is  not  and  has  not  been  the  main \ncontribution of regional judicial institutions. \n \nInstead,  the  lessons  from  regional  courts  elsewhere  suggest  that  they  become  active \nengines  of  integration  if  two  conditions  are  present.2 First,  and  most  important,  there \nmust be legally binding regional rules that create rights and obligations for private parties. \nThis allows private parties to sue and be sued on the basis of international law. Second, \nthere  must  be  an  institutional  configuration  that  allows  private  parties  access  to  a \nregional court. This can be direct (such as in the case of the European Court of Human \nRights) or indirect through references by national courts. National courts could decide to \nresolve  disputes  over  the  implementation  of  regional  rules  without  reference  to  a \nregional court. Yet, there are instances where they are obliged to do so or when it is in \ntheir interest to do so. In such cases, regional courts can contribute to the harmonization \nof laws, rules, and practices, which in turn may stimulate transnational economic activity.  \n                                            \n\n1  Alter (2009) finds evidence of almost 30,000 rulings issued by standing international courts until 2007. \nAbout  90%  of  these  rulings  come  from  regional  courts.  This  number  does  not  include  rulings  by \narbitration panels or non-permanent courts. \n\n2  For a similar argument, see Alter (2009). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nWhile  Asia  has  few  regional  treaties  that  create  legal  obligations  and  rights  for  private \nparties,  there is  a  broad  body  of  international  trade  and  commercial  law  that  is  already \nrelevant. I suggest that a judicial institution could be created that can, at the request of \nnational courts or administrative agencies, offer advisory opinions on the interpretation of \ninternational  rules,  laws,  and  standards  that  are  already  applicable.  The  underlying \nassumption  is  that  governments  want  to  see  those  obligations  implemented  but  that \nnational  administrative  agencies  or  courts  may  not  always  be  well-equipped  to  do  so. \nThe new institution would allow Asian states to send a signal that they are committed to \ntake  their  legal  obligations  seriously.  Moreover,  it  would  contribute  to  the  uniform \napplication  (and  thus  harmonization)  of  commercial  law  while  allowing  each  state  to \nmake new obligations at their own pace. The concluding sections offer some thoughts on \npolitical feasibility, issues of institutional design, and expected effects. \n\n2. \n\n \n \nHow Could Regional Judicial Institutions Promote \nEconomic Integration? \n\n \n\nIn  what  way  could  regional  judicial  institutions  contribute  to  economic  integration  and \ncooperation?  Regional  economic  cooperation  refers  to  cooperative  policies  such  as \nsharing technology, reducing trade barriers, and otherwise facilitating market access for \nregional  parties.  Regional  economic \nimplies  harmonization  or \nstandardization  of  laws  and  regulations  across  countries.  Cooperation  and  integration \nare  ultimately  aimed  at  increasing  economic  transactions.  Judicial  institutions  address \ntwo  immediate  problems  that  arise  in  any  such  project:  dispute  resolution  and  rule \ninterpretation. These activities may have broader effects by improving compliance with, \ncommitment  to,  and  implementation  of  regional  agreements.  This  section  briefly \ndiscusses each in turn. \n \n\nintegration  also \n\n2.1  Dispute Resolution \n \nAn  increase  in  economic  transactions  also  increases  the  probability  that  disputes  arise \nbetween governments and/or private parties across borders. The expectation that such \ndisputes are resolved in an impartial and efficient way by third parties both increases the \nlikelihood that contracts are entered into and the likelihood that transactions continue in \nthe  aftermath  of  disputes.  The  ability  to  adjudicate  disputes  is  central  to  courts  around \nthe  world.  The  minimal  institutional  design  requirements  for  effective  dispute resolution \nare limited. The ideal-typical model requires primarily that the third actor who resolves a \ndispute is impartial and that there are few impediments to utilizing the dispute resolution \nmechanism (Shapiro 1981). \n \nThese requirements do not necessarily imply a standing court but could be achieved with \narbitration. In its most basic version, two parties both agree to submit a dispute to a third \nparty and make some promise to accept the third party\u2018s ruling. In most cases, however, \nstates agree ex ante (through a treaty) that certain actors (other states, foreign investors) \nhave  a  right  to  sue  them  in  a  particular  forum.    This  is  a  delegation  of  authority  with \nsovereignty costs attached to it. The motivation for states to do so is that by granting the \nright to be sued they expect increased trade and/or investment in the same way that the \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       3 \n\nright to be sued is essential for business to enter into contracts.  In most arbitral models, \neach party appoints one panelist. These two panelists appoint the third one with mutual \nconsent.  This  model  is  especially  prevalent  in  the  resolution  of  investment  disputes, \noften done under the auspices of a standard set of procedures, such as those stipulated \nby  the  World  Bank\u2018s  International  Centre  for  the  Settlement  of  Investment  Disputes \n(ICSID).  It  is  also  used  in  some  regional  trade  disputes,  such  as  NAFTA\u2018s  binational \nreview panels. Other treaties create permanent dispute settlement bodies, meaning that \nstates have less control over panel composition.  \n \nThere  is  some  controversy  over  whether  creating  dispute  settlement  bodies  actually \nincreases trade (see Rose 2004, Tomz et al 2007) or investment (see B\u00fcthe and Milner \n2009),  although  all  of  this  evidence  is  from  bilateral  treaty  membership  or  GATT/WTO \nrather than for regional agreements.  There is strong evidence that domestic courts that \nresolve simple economic disputes in an efficient manner stimulate economic activity (e.g. \nDjankov  et  al  2003).    It  is  unclear,  however,  to  what  extent  international  dispute \nresolution  mechanisms  fit  this  paradigm.  Indeed,  much  of  the  criticism  targeted  at  the \nWTO  dispute  resolution  mechanism  argues  that  developing  countries  lack  the  legal \ncapacity to pursue cases effectively and that this deters them from initiating disputes (e.g. \nBusch et al 2009, Davis and Bermeo 2009).  \n\n \nInterpretation \n\n2.2 \n \nAttempts to standardize rules, regulations, and laws across countries can only contribute \nto increased economic activity if the agreements that establish such standardization are \nsimilarly translated into national laws, rules, and practices. Regional courts can play an \nimportant  role  in  ensuring  a  uniform  interpretation  of  regional  agreements  across \nmember states. All courts engage in interpretational activities of some sort. At a minimum, \ncourts  must  make  a  judgment  on  how  a  particular  case  fits  the  law.  Yet,  treaties  are \nalways  incomplete  or  imprecise.  Consequently,  courts  frequently  make  determinations \nabout  precisely  how  a  treaty  should  be  interpreted.  These  determinations  do  not \nnecessarily match the desires of the states that created the treaty. Such interpretations \ncan have broad impact, especially if other courts or panels rely on them.  \n \nThis  latter  point  is  worth  elaborating  on. There is  no formal  principle of  stare  decisis  in \ninternational law. Most international tribunals are asked to limit their focus to the dispute \nat hand. For example, article 59 of the ICJ\u2018s Statute proclaims that \u2015The decision of the \nCourt  has  no  binding force except  between the parties  and  in respect  of  that  particular \ncase\u2016  (ICJ  Statute,  Article  59).  Yet,  the  ICJ  motivates  its  resolution  of  disputes  with \nthese  as  precedent \nextensive  references \n(Shahabuddeen  2007). De facto  norms  of  stare decisis  are  operative  at the WTO (e.g. \nBusch 2007). Similarly, the ECJ and the ECtHR rely heavily on their past decisions, have \nno trepidations in referring to these decisions as \u2015precedent\u2016 (e.g. Wildhaber 2000) and \nhave developed elaborate systems to keep track of their case-law.3  \n \n \n                                            \n\nits  past  opinions  and  considers \n\n3  For  example,  the  ECtHR\u2018s  case  law  on-line  system  Hudoc  documents  the  \u2015Strasbourg  law\u2016  each \n\nto \n\ndecision relies on. Similarly, EUR-Lex documents the case-law for the ECJ. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nThat norms resembling stare decisis have developed on international courts should not \nbe surprising and partially follows from their dispute settlement roles. Courts need to tell \nthe losing parties why they lost. In all modern societies, judges tell the loser: \"You did not \nlose  because  we  the  judges  chose  that  you  should  lose.  You  lost  because  the  law \nrequired that you should lose\" (Shapiro 1994).  Such justification is essential to establish \nthe  perception  that  a  tribunal  is  impartial.  Demonstrating  the  consistency  of  a  decision \nwith past decisions may alleviate the losing party\u2018s potential to claim that a decision was \nwhimsical  or  motivated  by  non-legal  considerations  (e.g.  Shapiro  1981,  Stone  Sweet \n2002).  Concerns  about  justification  are  perhaps  even  stronger  on  international  courts, \nwhich  generally  operate  in  a  more  uncertain  compliance  environment  than  domestic \ncourts.4  \n \nAlthough all international judicial institutions engage in treaty interpretation of some sort, \nthere is large variation in how far-reaching their authority is in this regard. Some arbitral \ndecisions  are  not  public  and  thus  cannot  contribute  to  uniform  interpretation.  Other \nregional courts are merely allowed to give non-binding advisory opinions to states and at \nthe request of states. Such opinions could have a broad effect only if they are accepted \nby states. Yet other institutions have constitutional review authority; including the ability \nto nullify domestic laws that are in violation of a regional agreement.5 Some courts also \nhave  administrative  review  roles,  evaluating  complaints  by  private  actors \nthat \ngovernment  agencies  have  failed  to  properly  implement  a  regional  treaty. 6 For  such \ncourts  to  function  properly,  they  must  have  compulsory  jurisdiction  and  allow  private \naccess, either through a system of preliminary references by national courts or directly.  \n \nThe key quality that a court should have to exercise its interpretive function is expertise. \nIndeed,  there  is  some  evidence  that  administrative  agencies  and  national  courts  refer \ndecisions to regional courts because the national courts lack expertise in a certain area, \nsuch as intellectual property rights law (Helfer and Alter 2009). In addition judges should \nhave  incentives  to  issue  rulings  according  to  their  expertise  as  opposed  to  concerns \nabout  the  future  of  their  careers  or  the  desires  of  the  governments  who  may  have \nappointed  them  (Voeten  2008,  2009).  This  requires  some  independence  on  the  part  of \njudges, at least to the degree that judges should believe that states will not interfere in a \nparticular  case  or  will  punish  them  for  interpreting  a  treaty  in  a  manner  that  is \ninconsistent with the wishes of a government. \n \n\n                                            \n\n4  At least in comparison to domestic courts in developed democracies. There are, of course, numerous \ndomestic courts who operate in a weaker compliance environment than, say, the ECJ. There may also \nbe reasons that norms to adhere to past precedent are not quite as strong in international courts. For \nexample,  the  ECtHR  has  developed  a  \u2015margin  of  appreciation\u2016  doctrine,  which  posits  that  countries \nshould  have  some  leeway  in  how  they  implement  their  Convention  obligations  into  their  specific \ndomestic  contexts  (e.g.  Yourow  1996).  This  leaves  judges  some  room  to  motivate  deviations  from \ncase-law with reference to specific national circumstances. \n\n5  Nullification is not always a direct consequence of a regional court\u2018s actions. For example, the ECtHR \ncan find that a domestic law is in violation of the ECHR but this does not automatically imply that the \ndomestic law is nullified. It does, however, imply that future litigants can expect the same outcome of \nchallenges to the domestic law, giving governments incentives to change the law. \n6  See Alter 2009 on the distinction between constitutional and administrative review roles. \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       5 \n\n2.3  Compliance \n \nTheories of international cooperation stipulate that fear of non-compliance is one of the \nmain  issues  that  stifles  potentially  beneficial  cooperation  between  states.  This  is \nespecially so in Prisoner-dilemma type situations, where governments do not engage in \nmutually  beneficial  cooperation  because  they  fear  that  they  will  be  the  ones  to  take \ncostly  measures  to  implement  regional  agreements,  leaving  others  to  benefit.  The \npresence of a regional judicial institution could help in this regard even at the negotiation \nstage.  If  states  expect  enforcement,  they  may  be  more  careful  to  construct  regional \nagreements  that  they  expect  to  comply  with  (e.g.  Fearon  1998).  This  may  not \nnecessarily increase the volume of regional agreements but should increase their quality. \n \nAll courts aim to increase compliance to some degree, hoping that the shadow of binding \njudicial enforcement makes it more likely that states comply with agreed upon rules. Yet, \nthe  prospect  of  a  costly  law  suit  by  another  state  may  not  be  sufficient  incentive  for \ncompliance.  Legalized  dispute  resolution  between  states  is  an  indirect  way  to  resolve \ntrade disputes. The parties that directly benefit from or are hurt by unfair trade practices \nare  generally  firms.  Firms  lobby  their  governments  in  order  to  convince  them  that  it  is \nalso  in  their  interest  to  incur  the  economic  and  political  cost  of  launching  a  dispute \nagainst another government. These political costs may be especially high in the context \nof a regional integration project. It may not seem credible that a global institution such as \nthe  WTO  has  a  bias  for  or  against  (for  example)  Malaysia  or  Indonesia.  Yet,  such \ncharges  are  more  likely  in  a  context  where  there  are  few  actors  with  well-understood \nhistories  and  cleavages.  Regional  institutions  generally  serve  other  purposes  than \nresolving  disputes.  Potential  charges  of  bias  in  the  resolution  of  contentious  disputes \nmay have negative spillover effects to the workings of these institutions. Indeed, the data \nwill show that regional courts embedded in larger integration projects are rarely used to \nresolve inter-state disputes.  \n \nSome regional agreements address compliance more directly, by creating a treaty body \nthat monitors compliance by member states and can file infringement or non-compliance \ncases  with  a  regional  court.  Examples  are  the  European  commission,  but  also  the \nAndean Community and other regional organizations have such treaty bodies (see Alter \n2009,  Ch.  2  for  an  overview).  Others  allow  private  actors  direct  access,  either  directly \n(the  European  Court  of Human Rights)  or  indirectly  by  allowing  national  courts  to refer \ncases to a regional court. Such arrangements substantially reduce the cost of litigation in \ncomparison to pure inter-state disputes and thus should increase the expectation that a \nregional agreement will be enforced.  Yet, there are also larger sovereignty costs to such \ninstitutional arrangements. \n\n \nImplementation and Administrative Authority \n\n2.4 \n \nNon-compliance is not necessarily the result of willful acts by governments to act in ways \nthat are inconsistent with treaty commitments. Many issues of non-compliance arise due \nto the complexity of implementing agreements (see Chayes and Chayes 1993, Raustiala \nand  Slaughter  2002).  Implementing  regional  agreements  generally  requires  delegating \ntasks to a bureaucracy or even an independent regulatory agency. Bureaucracies vary in \ntheir technical capacities to implement regional regulation. Moreover, agencies generally \n\n \n\n\f \n\n6          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nhave  some  discretion  and  could  potentially  abuse  this  to  implement  their  own  policy \npreferences or extract rents.  \n \nAllowing  private  parties  to  challenge  administrative  decisions  in  front  of  impartial \ntribunals  could  limit  such  practices  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  administrative \nagencies  to  correctly  implement  regional  rules.  Such  fire  alarm  control  could  be \nexercised  by  domestic  administrative  tribunals.  Regional  tribunals  have  the  added \nbenefit  of  contributing  to  coordination  of  interpretation.  This  is  important  as  common \nregulation  only  has  the  desired  effect  if  it  is  interpreted  in  a  common  way.  Moreover, \nregional  courts  may  have  better  expertise  to  interpret  international  law.  In  several \nregional  agreements,  most  notably  the  EU,  OHADA,  and  the  Andean  Community, \nnational courts then have the right or obligation to refer disputes over regional law to a \nregional  court.  As  the  empirical  part  of  this  paper  will  demonstrate,  many  of  these \ndisputes are between private parties and regulatory agencies over the proper application \nof  regional  law  in  the  denial  of  permits,  trademarks,  and  so  on.  These  regional  courts \noften  issue  advisory  rulings  only  about  the  interpretation  of  regional  law  in  a  case, \nleaving  the  actual  resolution  of  a  dispute  to  the  national  court.  This  limits  their \ninterference with domestic sovereignty. \n \nThere are two other ways in which regional courts contribute to checking administrative \nauthority.  First,  some  regional  integration  projects,  most  notably  the  EU,  create  new \nsupranational  bureaucracies  with  the  authority  to  implement,  interpret,  and  even  issue \nlegally  binding  rules  and  rulings.  The  ECJ  often  reviews  disputes  between  the \nCommission  and  states  or  private  parties  about  the  proper  exercise  of  that  authority. \nSecond,  the  ECtHR  has  determined  on  various  occasions  that  existing  procedures  for \nadministrative  review  in  countries  such  as  the  Netherlands  and  Sweden  were  not  truly \nindependent,  for  example  because  the  review  determinations  were  also  done  by \nadministrators rather than judges. Such rulings have led to important institutional reforms. \n \nThere is a large literature in economics that illustrates the positive economic effects of a \nproper  system  of  checks  and  balances  to  the  exercise  of  administrative  authority  (e.g. \nPersson  and  Tabellini  2003).  Recent  research  in  economic  history  suggests  that  the \nneed to check administrative power was the key to the development of the rule of law in \nmodern  Europe  (Gonz\u00e1lez  de  Lara  et  al,  2008,  Greif  2008).  Such  checking  of \nadministrative  authority  aids  in  the  harmonization  of  law  across  countries,  prevents \nabuses  of  authority,  and  helps  make  administrative  decisions  more  predictable  for \nbusinesses.  All  of  these  activities  theoretically  stimulate  economic  activity.  Moreover, \nthey  interfere  less  directly  with  sovereignty  than  the  remedies  targeted  at  willful  non-\ncompliance by states. \n \n \n2.5  Credibility of Commitments \n \nRegional  cooperation  may  be  stifled  by  uncertainties  about  the  degree  to  which  actors \nare  committed  to  the  project.  Regional  agreements  suffer  from  a  time  inconsistency \nproblem:  even  if  it  is  in the  interest  of  a government  to  comply  with an agreement,  the \nincentives  for  that  government  may  change  or  the  government  may  lose  power.  Since \nregional cooperation and especially integration often require costly ex ante investments \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       7 \n\nwith  promises  of  long-term  benefits,  uncertainty  about  the  commitment  of  actors  could \nstifle a cooperation project.  \n \nDelegating  authority  to  an  independent  court  increases  the  credibility  of  these \ncommitments.  For  example,  new  democracies  may  want  to  signal  that  they  are \ncommitted  to  upholding  human  rights  by  signing  a  human  rights  treaty.  They  could \nincrease  the  credibility  of  that  commitment  by  also  delegating  authority  to  interpret  a \ntreaty  to  a  regional  court  and  allowing  citizens  to  directly  file  suit  with  that  court \n(Moravcsik  2000).  This  may  increase  the  perception  of  other  actors  that  these \ngovernments  are  committed  to  a  regional  integration  effort  and  perhaps  make  actors \nmore likely to make long-term investments (Farber 2002). Governments also frequently \nuse judgments by international courts to explain to their domestic publics why they have \nto  maintain  an  unpopular  (protectionist)  policy  (Reinhardt  2002),  thus  potentially \nalleviating  fears  that  cooperation  will  stop  due  to  domestic  opposition.  Moreover, \ndelegation to regional courts may alleviate concerns among smaller states that they will \nbe subjected to power-based inequalities in the implementation of regional agreements. \nSuch assurances could be central to deepen cooperation among states.  \n \nThe credibility of a commitment to regional integration is only increased if the delegation \nto  the  regional  court  is  meaningful  in  the  sense  that  court  is  independent,  has \ncompulsory jurisdiction, is easily accessible for potential disputants, imposes meaningful \npenalties  on  non-compliance,  and  is  costly  to  withdraw  from.  Indeed,  the  very  logic  of \nthis argument stipulates that there are benefits to incurring sovereignty costs.   \n\n3. \n\nAre Asian States Less Likely To Resolve Disputes Through \nLegal Means? \n\nWhy have Asian countries, in contrast to governments elsewhere, seemingly rejected the \npotential  benefits  of  regional  courts  discussed  in  the  previous  section?  The  answer  to \nthis  question  is  important  for  understanding  the  lessons  that  can  plausibly  be  learned \nfrom  experience  elsewhere.  Many  accounts  of  why  Asian  countries  prefer  cooperation \nwithout legalization are based on the notion that Asian states share a strong preference \nfor  non-binding  commitments  and  non-legalistic  methods  of  dispute  resolution.  This  is \ngenerally considered a central feature of the \"ASEAN way\" as well as the \"Asia-Pacific \nway\"  of  cooperation  (e.g.  Acharya  1997).  To  some  scholars  this  stems  from  a  distinct \nlegal culture that is less adversarial and litigious than Western legal culture (e.g. Green \n1994). Instead, Asian approaches to dispute resolution stress consensus and informality. \nScholars have identified such differences in legal culture as one of the main challenges \nfor  Asian  states  to  participate  in  global  legal  regimes,  such  as  the  WTO  (Peng  2000).  \nSome  claim  that  the  rise  of  Asian  economies  will  significantly  challenge  the  emerging \nglobal legal culture based on US legal practices and replace it with a culture based on \ninformal  dispute  resolution  (Appelbaum  1997).  Others  argue  that  Asian  countries  differ \nnot  so  much  because  they  lack  an  adversarial  legal  culture  but  because  of  their \ndomestic  political  institutions  and  the  sensitive  nature  of  diplomatic  relations  between \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nAsian states.7 Again others maintain that Asian governments\u2018 unusually strong concerns \nabout  sovereignty  costs  lie  at  the  root  of  their  unwillingness  to  use  legalized  forms  of \ndispute settlement (Poon 2001). \n\nThere is considerable criticism of the notion that there are cultural or institutional reasons \nthat underpin the cooperation without legalization route that Asian regionalism has taken. \nFor example, scholars have pointed to the diversity in Asia\u2018s domestic political and legal \ninstitutions  (Kahler  2000,  Pryles  2006).  Yet,  as  far  as  I  am  aware,  there  are  no \nsystematic tests in the literature of the proposition that Asian states are less likely than \nothers  to  resolve  their  disputes  through  legal  means.  Such  a  test  is  important  for  the \npurposes of this paper. If Asian countries have unusually strong predispositions against \nusing legal means to resolve disputes, then the lessons from other regions may not be \napplicable to the Asian context.  \n \nMy  empirical  strategy  for  evaluating  this  question  is  to  replicate  recently  published \nanalyses  of  legalized  dispute  resolutions  in  three  critical  areas:  trade,  investment,  and \nterritory. I then add an indicator variable for whether a country is Asian, as defined by the \nADB.8  \n\nTrade Disputes \n\n3.1 \n \nIf Asian countries are averse to legalized dispute settlement, they may be less likely to \ninitiate trade disputes at the GATT/WTO than are other countries. In a study published in \nthe  Journal  of  Politics,  Davis  and  Bermeo  (2009)  analyze  why  some  developing \ncountries are more likely than others to initiate disputes at the GATT/WTO. They argue \nthat  there  are  large  start-up  costs  for  using  the  dispute  settlement  process.  Therefore, \nthey hypothesize that past experience as a complainant or defendant makes states more \nlikely to initiate disputes in the future. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI replicated their analysis (without problems) and added an indicator variable for whether \na  country  is  Asian.  The  sample  includes  75  developing  countries  that  were  WTO \nmembers  by  2003  (the  end  of  the  data),  including  14  Asian  countries.  The  analysis \nexcludes  31  least  developed  countries  who  are  beneficiaries  to  preferential  market \naccess  and  have  less  need  to  invoke  WTO  rights.  Davis  and  Bermeo  argue  that  the \ncorrelates that determine dispute initiation among developed countries are different and \nestimate a separate model for this group. The dependent variable is the number of cases \na  country  initiated  in  a  given  year.  The  model  is  estimated  using  a  negative  binomial \nregression, with robust standard errors clustered on countries. \n \nTable 1 offers the results of the simplest specifications estimated by Davis and Bermeo. \nThe indicator for Asia does not have an effect on either developing or developed country \ndispute  initiation.  This  result  also  holds  in  the  more  extensive  models  with  additional \ncontrol  variables  and  a  model  where  the  dependent  variable  is  converted  to  a  binary \n                                            \n\n7  For  example,  Davis  and  Shirato  (2007)  use  such  an  account  to  explain  Japan\u2018s  restraint  in  initiating \nWTO  trade  disputes.  This  also  fits  with  the  large  literature  that  sees  democracy  as  the  key  to \nexplaining trends in legalization (add citations). \n\n8  http://www.adb.org/Countries/ (accessed 30 June 2009). Japan is also included. \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       9 \n\nindicator, allowing for the use of a logit estimation. Finally, the result holds for developing \ncountries if the democracy variable is omitted from the regression model, indicating that \nit is not the scarcity of democracies in Asia that drives this result. \n \nIn  all,  there  is  no  evidence  that Asian  countries  are  more  averse  to  seeking  legalized \nresolutions of their trade disputes. Of the 352 disputes initiated between the start of the \nWTO  process  in  1995  and  October  2006,  there  have  been  nine  within-Asia  disputes \nbetween Singapore and Malaysia, Republic of Korea (Korea) and Japan (2), Japan and \nIndonesia  (2),  Korea  and  the  Philippines,  Bangladesh  and  India,  Indonesia  and  Korea, \nand Taipei,China and India.9 This is more than the number of disputes filed among Latin \nAmerican,  European, African,  or  Central American  states. There are  obviously  different \nbase-line  probabilities  for  the  filing  of  such  within  region  disputes,  yet  it  is  hard  to \nmaintain  based  on  these  data  that Asian  states  have  a  deep  cultural  aversion  against \nlegalized resolutions of their trade disputes. \n\n3.2 \n\nInvestment Disputes \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  regulation  of  foreign  investment  has  long  been  a  potent  source  for  disputes, \nespecially  when  foreign  property  is  expropriated  by  host  governments  of  foreign \ninvestments. In recent years, the regulation of foreign investment has increasingly taken \nthe form of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs), which may or may not delegate authority \nto an international authority to resolve disputes between foreign firms and governments \n(e.g.  Franck  2007).  The  most  prominent  international  body  that  resolves  the  vast \nmajority  of  investment  disputes  is  the  World  Bank\u2018s  International  Centre  for  the \nSettlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). ICSID rulings are public, are closely watched \nby investors, and are consequential for future FDI streams (Allee and Peinhardt 2009b). \nGovernments have much less control over ICSID dispute resolution mechanisms than if \nthey  delegated  dispute  resolution  to  ad  hoc  arbitral  tribunals  or  domestic  courts  (e.g. \nFranck 2007).  \n \nIf  Asian  countries  indeed  prefer  cooperation  without  legalized  dispute  settlement,  we \nwould expect these countries to be less willing to delegate authority to ICSID when they \nagree  on  cooperation  by  signing  a  BIT. Allee  and  Peinhardt  (2009a)  coded  all  publicly \narchived  BITs  for  their  level  of  delegation  to  ICSID.  They  create  an  ordinal  variable, \ncoded  0  in  the  absence  of  any  delegation,  1  if  ICSID  is  one  of  the  options  for  dispute \nresolutions and 2 if ICSID is the only venue for international arbitration. They argue that \nthis  variable  reflects  the  degree  of  delegation  in  an  ordinal  way  because  governments \nusually  have  some  control  over  the  venue  of  arbitration  if  ICSID  is  only  one  of  more \noptions.  The  negotiation  of  BITs  tends  to  be  asymmetric  in  that  there  is  usually  one \n\u2017home\u2018  country  (from  which  most  of  the  investment  originates)  and  a  \u2017host\u2018  country \n(towards  which  the  investment  is  directed).  Home  countries  typically  (although  not \nalways) tend to prefer ICSID delegation but the preferences of host countries vary.  \n \n \n                                            \n\n9  Based  on  the  World  Bank\u2018s  WTO  data:  http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/ \nEXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:20804376~pagePK:64214825~piPK:64214943~theSitePK:469382,00.ht\nml (accessed 13 July 2009). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nAllee  and  Peinhardt  identify  a  range  of  characteristics  of  host  countries  and  home \ncountries  as  well  as  of  the  relationship  between  them  that  would  make  it  more  or  less \nlikely that a BIT includes an ICSID provision. I refer the interested reader to their article \nfor more details on the theoretical motivation for including these variables. The appendix \nlists  the  variables  and  precise  data  sources.  I  replicated  their  original  results  (without \nproblems)  and  added  to  their  model  indicator  variables  for  whether  there  is  an  Asian \nhome or host country and an additional indicator variable for whether both countries are \nAsian.  \n \nTable  2  has  the  results  from  an  ordinal  probit  model.  Quite  strikingly,  an  Asian  home \ncountry  makes  it  significantly  more  likely  that  a  BIT  delegates  authority  to  ICSID.  The \nsame is true for an Asian host country, although this effect is only significant at the 10% \nlevel in a two-tailed test. There is no additional effect of both countries being Asian. It is \nclear  that  Asian  countries  are  not  more  likely  to  cooperate  without  legalized  dispute \nresolution. If anything, the result seems to go the other way. \n \nIt is perhaps plausible that this reflects the specific Asian countries who sign BITs or that \nAsian  countries  are  less  likely  to  sign  BITs  because  they  expect  that  a  legalized \ncommitment  will  be  involved.  There  is,  as  far  as  I  can  tell,  no  evidence  in  the  BIT \nliterature  of  such  a  proposition.  Moreover,  coverage  is  broad.  The  data  includes  BITs \nwith 16 different Asian home governments and 29 different Asian host governments. 112 \n(11%)  of  the  BITs  have  home  countries  that  are  Asian  and  251  (25%)  have  host \ncountries  that  are  Asian.  This  includes  65  BITs  involving  People\u2018s  Republic  of  China, \nwhich only include exclusive ICSID clauses in 9% of its BITs and had no ICSID option in \n59%  of  its  treaties.  In  all,  though,  exclusive  delegation  to  ICSID  exists  in  45%  of  BITs \nwith  an  Asian  home  country,  36%  of  BITs  with  an  Asian  host  country,  42%  of  BITs \nbetween  two  Asian  states  but  only  29%  of  the  total  population  of  BITs.  Moreover, \ncountries  that  are  threatening  to  leave  the  ICSID  system  appear  to  be  from  Latin \nAmerica,  not  Asia  (Franck  2009,  p.  436-7).These  data  simply  do  not  support  a \nconclusion that Asian countries that have signed BITs are particularly averse to legalized \ndispute settlement (i.e. they do not prefer cooperation without legalization).10 \n\n \nTerritorial Disputes \n\n3.3 \n \nTerritory is another commodity over which states frequently bargain and even fight. Yet, \nterritorial  disputes  can  also  be  settled  through  legal  dispute  resolution,  for  example \nthrough the International Court of Justice (ICJ) the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). \nA characteristic of such legal solutions is that both countries need to agree to it. If Asian \ncountries  are  averse  to  legalized  solutions,  then  territorial  disputes  involving  Asian \ncountries should be less likely to be resolved by legal means than are other disputes. \n \nIn  a  study  published  in  the  American  Political  Science  Review, Allee  and  Huth  (2006) \ninvestigate  what  makes  states  more  and  less  likely  to  choose  legal  dispute  resolution \nover bilateral negotiations as a means for settling territorial disputes. They identify 1490 \nbilateral  rounds  of  negotiations  in  348  disputes  over  territory.  They  then  code  whether \n                                            \n\n10  Note that since companies rather than states tend to file ICSID suits, it is more useful to analyze the \n\ninitial decision to allow this to take place rather than the actual usage of ICSID. \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       11 \n\nthe  negotiation  round  ended  in  a  stalemate,  compromise  (bilateral  concessions)  or  a \nlegalized  form  of  dispute  resolution.  Their  core  theoretical  contribution  is  the  argument \nthat international legal rulings at least in some significant part provide political cover for \nleaders in need of making concessions. \n \nI  refer  the  interested  reader  to  the  Allee  and  Huth  article  for  more  detail  on  model \nspecification.  The  appendix  provides  more  detail  on  measurement.  I  successfully \nreplicated their  analyses  (Table  2 in  the  article) and added  two  indicator  variables:  one \nfor  whether  the  dispute  involved  an  Asian  country  (true  for  350  (23%)  of  rounds  of \nnegotiations in the data) and one for whether both parties in the dispute were Asian (true \nfor 199 (13%) of cases).  The second variable is included to assess whether there is an \nadditional effect if both parties are Asian and thus, presumably, unlikely to resort to legal \nsolutions for their territorial disputes.  \n \nTable  3  shows  that  there  is  no  significant  effect  of  Asian  involvement  on  the  likelihood \nthat a dispute has a legal resolution. Thus, the involvement of Asian countries makes it \nneither  more  or  less  likely  that  a  dispute  is  resolved  through  legal  means.  Creating \nexclusive category where one indicator variable measures whether only one Asian state \nis  involved  does  not  materially  affect  the  result  nor  does  dropping  the  indicator  for \nwhether the conflict involves two Asian states. \n \nThe Allee and Huth data only runs until 1995. Since then, there have been at least two \nother  Asian  territorial  disputes  that  were  submitted  to  the  ICJ:  the  dispute  over  Pedra \nBranca/Pulau  Batu  Puteh,  Middle  Rocks  and  South  Ledge  between  Malaysia  and \nSingapore  and  the  dispute  over  Pulau  Ligitan  and  Pulau  Sipadan  between  Indonesia \nand  Malaysia.  In  all,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Asian  countries  are  more  reluctant  than \nothers to seek legalized dispute settlement for their territorial conflicts. \n\n \n \nRegional Resolution of Inter-State Disputes \n\n4. \n\nThe preceding section demonstrates that Asian states are not less likely to resolve inter-\nstate disputes through legal means in  global institutions. Another plausible story is that \nAsian regional integration projects have a distinct social logic that warrants cooperation \nwithout  legalization  and  that  explicitly  rejects  European-style  institutionalization.  This  is \nespecially  reflected  in  the  \"ASEAN  way\"  of  regional  cooperation.  As  Acharya  (1997, \np.329) puts it:  \n\n[..]  the  \"ASEAN  way\"  is  not  so  much  about  the  substance  or  structure  of \nmultilateral  interactions,  but  a  claim  about  the  process  through  which  such \ninteractions are carried out. This approach involves a high degree of discreetness, \ninformality,  pragmatism,  expediency,  consensus-building,  and  non-confrontational \nbargaining  styles  which  are  often  contrasted  with  the  adversarial  posturing  and \nlegalistic decision-making procedures in Western multilateral negotiations. \n\nThe  \"ASEAN  way\"  influenced  Asia-Pacific  regional  cooperation  and  has  also  been \ntermed  the  \"Asian  way\"  of  regional  cooperation  (Acharya  1997).  Indeed,  there  is  no \ndocumented use of legalized regional mechanisms to settle disputes between states in \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nAsia.  This  section  evaluates  whether  this  aversion  to  the  use  of  regional  legalized \nresolution  of  inter-state  disputes  is  unusual.  Inter-state  disputes  are  those  where  one \nstate  files  dispute  against  each  other  and  each  state  gets  to  present  its  case  before  a \ntribunal.  As the  summary  below  will  show,  while  virtually  all  regional judicial  institutions \nallow for such inter-state disputes (as does the ASEAN dispute settlement mechanism), \nthese provisions are rarely used.  \n\n \n\nInter-State Disputes in Regional Tribunals \n\n4.1 \n \nThere  are  four  standing  international  courts11 in  Europe.  The  best  known  ones  are  the \nhighest  courts  of  the  European  Union:  the  European  Court  of  Justice  (ECJ)  and  the \nCourt of First Instance (CFI). Under Article 227, EU member states could directly bring \ncomplaints  to  the  ECJ  against  other  member  states.  The  article  has  been  used  only  a \nhandful of times and was described as \u2015a virtual dead letter\u2016 in a recent overview of ECJ \nactivity (Brunell et al 2008). The Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Agreement \n(EFTA) resolves disputes involving countries that are not part of the EU but that are part \nof  the  European  Free  Trade  Area.12 The  agreement  that  establishes  the  EFTA  Court \ngrants the Court jurisdiction to settle disputes between two or more member states.13 Yet, \nnone  of  its  102  pending  or  decided  cases  are  inter-state  disputes.14 The  BENELUX \nCourt  of  Justice  interprets  rules  of  law  common  to  Belgium,  the  Netherlands,  and \nLuxemburg. The BENELUX treaty established a College of Arbitrators to settle disputes \nbetween states but it has not appointed new arbitrators since the first nomination in 1962 \nand has never been used.15 Finally, the Council of Europe\u2018s European Court of Human \nRights  (ECtHR)  has  issued  over  10,000  judgments  on  individual  complaints  but  only  3 \ninter-state cases.16 As of 2009, these courts have together allowed inter-state cases for \n172 years. Yet, it is difficult to find even 10 examples of such cases. In short, European \nstates have not settled their inter-state disputes by suing each other in regional courts.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  Economic  Court  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (ECCIS) \nwas  created  in  1991  to  resolve  trade  disputes  among  the  countries  belonging  to  the \nCommonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS)  (Danilenko  1999). 17  Unlike  the  other \nEuropean  courts,  the  legal  status  of  ECCIS  decisions  is  in  dispute  and  the  court  has \n\n                                            \n\n11 \n\nInformation  comes  from  the  Project  on  International  Courts  and  Tribunals:  http://www.pict-pcti.org \n(accessed 7 July 2009). \n\n12  Currently, these countries are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. \n13  Article 32, see http://www.eftacourt.int/index.php/court/mission/esa_court_agreement/ (accessed 6 July \n\n2009). \n\n14  http://www.eftacourt.int/index.php/cases (accessed 6 July 2009). \n15  http://www.pict-pcti.org/courts/beneluxCJ.html (accessed 7 July 2009). \n16  There  were  17  inter-state  complaints  that  were  dealt  with  by  the  European  Commission  on  Human \nRights.

While  little  information  is \navailable  about  these  9  cases,  the  perception  is  that  they  have  been  resolved  through \nnegotiation (Dragneva and De Kort 2007, fn. 112). \n \nThe  evidence  from  Latin  America  is  similar.  The  Court  of  Justice  of  the  Andean \nCommunity (ATJ) is the third most active international court with 1492 rulings (Helfer and \nAlter  2009,  Helfer  et  al  2009).  About  90%  of  these  cases  came  from  preliminary \nreferences  by  national  courts.  Almost  all  of  the  other  cases  were  initiated  by  a  treaty \norgan  (the  Secretary-General).  I  have  been  able  to  find  only  three  pure  inter-state \ncases.18 Mercosur  has  had  a  formal  arbitration  system  in  place  since  1991,  which  only \nallowed  access  to  state  parties.  As  of  2005,  arbitration  panels  had  issued  only  nine \nawards (Vervaele 2005). Institutional reforms to create more advanced forms of dispute \nresolution are under way.  \n \nThe  Central  American  Court  of  Justice  (CACJ)  was  originally  established  in  1907  to \nmaintain  peace  and  resolve  disagreements  between  Central  American  States.  It  was \ndissolved  in 1918.  Three of the  court\u2018s  ten  decisions  were  inter-state  cases.19 Since  its \nrestart in 1990, the court has issued an additional 78 rulings (Alter 2009) but it is unclear \nhow  many  are  inter-state  disputes.  The  Caribbean  Court  of  Justice  (CCJ)  was \nestablished  in  2001 20 by  the  members  of  the  Caribbean  Community  (CARICOM)  to \nreplace  the  Judicial  Committee  of  the  Privy  Council  and  to  interpret  the  Treaty \nEstablishing  the  Caribbean  Community.  The  court  has  issued  34  judgments,  none  of \nwhich were inter-state disputes.21 \n \nNAFTA  does  not  have  a  standing  court  but  does  allow  for  ad  hoc  binational  review \npanels, most  notable those under  chapter 19. This  has  led to concerns  about  strategic \nforum  shopping  with  the  WTO  (Busch  2007)  and  to  critiques  that  the  NAFTA  panels \nsupersede  conventional  judicial  review. 22  The  chapter  19  procedure  allows  private \nparties \ntheir  decisions  on  antidumping  or \ncountervailing  duties.  On  at  least  23  cases,  government  lawyers  argued  on  behalf  of \nthese  private  parties,  creating  a  perception  of  putting  two  state  actors  into  conflict  with \n\nto  sue  administrative  agencies \n\nfor \n\n                                            \n\n18  Article  24  of \n\nthe  Treaty  Creating \n\nthe  Court  of  Justice  of \n\nthe  Cartagena  Agreement \n(http://www.comunidadandina.org/ingles/normativa/ande_trie2.htm)  allows  states \nfile  non-\ncompliance claims with the secretary-general. The ATJ web-site suggests that it has happened on only \ncomplaint \nthree  occasions \n(http://idatd.eclac.cl/controversias/can.htm?perform=estadisticas&numero=5).  Yet,  when \nreading \ncases it becomes clear that several of the cases brought by the secretary-general originated with state \ncomplaints (private communication with Karen Alter and Larry Helfer, 7 July 2009). \n\nthe  originator  of  a  non-compliance \n\nstate  was \n\nthat  a \n\nto \n\n19  http://www.worldcourts.com/cacj/eng/decisions.htm (accessed 10 July 2009). \n20  The court was inaugurated in 2005. \n21  http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/judgments.html (accessed 10 July 2009). \n22  Adam Liptak \u2015Nafta Tribunals Stir U.S. Worries\u2016 The New York Times Sunday 18 April 2004. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\neach other.23 NAFTA does not have a treaty organ in charge of enforcement nor is it part \nof a deeper regional integration project.  \n \nAfrica  has  four  active  international  courts:  Common Court Of Justice And Arbitration Of \nThe Organization For The Harmonization Of Corporate Law In Africa (OHADA, or OHBLA), \nthe Court Of Justice Of The Common Market For Eastern And Southern Africa (COMESA), \nCourt of Justice of the East African Community (EACJ), and the Court of Justice of the \nEconomic  Community  of  West  African  States  (ECOWAS).  OHADA  aims  to  harmonize \ncorporate law in 16 mostly francophone African states. Its Common Court of Justice and \nArbitration  had  issued  274  judgments  by  2007  (Alter  2009),  none  were  inter-state \ncases.24 COMESA  established  a  common  market  between  19  states  in  Eastern  and \nSouthern Africa. Its court was established in 1994 and its first judges were appointed by \n1998.25 The Court had heard seven cases by 2007 (Alter 2009), none of which appear to \nbe inter-state cases.26 The EACJ and its predecessor have issued eight rulings, none of \nwhich  appear  to  have  been  inter-state  cases.27 The  ECOWAS  court  has  received  33 \ncases, none inter-state disputes.28 \n \nThere  are  also  a  number  of  courts  that  have  been  in  existence  for  some  time  but  that \nhave  never  or  rarely  been  used  (Alter  2009).  These  include  the  Organization  of  Arab \nPetroleum  Exporting  Countries  Tribunal  (OAPEC)  (1978),  The  West  African  Economic \nand Monetary Union Court (WAEMU) (1995) , the Community of Central Africa Court of \nJustice  (CEMAC)  (2000),  and  the  Tribunal  of  the  Southern  African  Development \nCommunity  (SADC)  (2007).29 Thus,  the  ASEAN  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  is  not \nthe only existing DSM that has not been used.  \n \n4.2  Why So Little Use of Regional Mechanisms for Inter-State Disputes? \n \nIn all, the number of standing regional courts is about equal to the total number of direct \ninter-state  disputes  that  they  have  resolved.  Why  are  there  so  few  inter-state  disputes \nsubmitted to regional courts? Part of the answer is that some regional agreements have \ntreaty bodies, such as the European Commission, that can file infringement suits against \n\n                                            \n\n23  Based  on  a  reading  of  disputes  at:  http://www.sice.oas.org/DISPUTE/nafdispe.asp  (accessed  7  July \n2009).  In  addition  there  were  25  disputes  filed  by  private  business  where  I  did  not  find  evidence  of \ngovernment  involvement  on  both  sides.  Chapter  11  also  gives  private  actors  standing  to  sue \ngovernments  for  damages,  a  procedure  that  has  been  widely  used.  There  has  also  been  one  inter-\nstate dispute under Chapter 20. \n\n24  http://www.ohada.com/jurisprudence.php (accessed 13 July 2009). \n25  http://about.comesa.int/lang-en/institutions/court-of-justice (accessed 13 July 2009). \n26 \n\nI  was  able  to  find  evidence  of  only  five  cases:  http://www.aictctia.org/courts_subreg/comesa/                                        \ncomesa_cases.html (accessed 13 July 2009). \n\n27  Alter 2009 and http://www.aict-ctia.org/courts_subreg/eac/eac_home.html (accessed 13 July 2009). \n28  http://www.aict-ctia.org/courts_subreg/ecowas/ecowas_home.html (accessed 13 July 2009). \n29  Moreover, there are a number of courts that are not yet operational, including the Court of Justice for \nthe  Arab  Magreb  Union  (AMU),  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  Economic  Community  of  Central  African \nStates (ECCAS), and the African Court of Justice (ACJ). \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       15 \n\nstates  and  that  can,  to  some  extent,  serve  as  substitutes  for  inter-state  disputes.  It  is \nlikely  that  some  complaints  about  foreign  practices  originate  with  other  governments, \nalthough there is no hard evidence that documents this. Politically, there is a difference \nbetween cases  between  a  commission  and  a government  and cases  where two states \ninvolved in a broader regional integration project directly challenge each other in court. \nAmong  others,  it  would  force  the  court  to  chose  sides  between  two  member  states, \nwhich  could  cause  some  fallout  for  a  regional  integration  project.  Moreover,  especially \nthe literature on the EU shows that the Commission often takes its own initiatives and is \nquite far from a simple tool that (powerful) member states can use to go after each other \n(e.g. Pollack 1997). Finally, DSMs in regions that lack a supranational body are also not \nfrequently  used,  suggesting  that  there  is  something  else  going  on  than  a  simple \nsubstitute story. \n \nThe  theory  section  already  highlighted  that  economic  disputes  between  states  are \nusually  proxy  disputes.    Businesses  are  harmed  or  benefit  from  unfair  trade  practices. \nStates are only hurt indirectly. There are many hurdles that may prevent states from filing \nsuits  against  each  other.  Businesses  must  lobby  governments  to  file  suits  on  their \nbehalves  and  pay  the  cost  for  this.  This  generally  only  works  if  they  come  from  a \nparticularly  influential  or  economically  important  sector.  In  such  cases,  it  may  be  more \nuseful  to  file  at  a  global  institution,  such  as  the  WTO,  where  the  precedent  will  be \nbroader.  There  are  many  other  ways  to  resolve  disputes  between  states  and  many \nissues that could be linked together in omnibus compromises. The patterns in the data \nalso  suggest  that  there  are  additional  political  cost  to  be  paid  from  using  regional \ninstitutions  for  inter-state  disputes.  For  example,  the  only  regional  tribunal  that  is  used \nsomewhat  frequently  to  resolve  (proxy)  inter-state  disputes  are  the  NAFTA  binational \nreview  panels,  which  exist  in  the  absence  of  a  broader  political  regional  integration \nproject. At times, the existence of a regional inter-state DSM may be a useful option, if \nonly as a potential outcome that all want to avoid. But there is little reason to believe that \nresolving  inter-state  disputes  has  been  a  major  contribution  of  regional  judicial \ninstitutions or that it will be in the Asian context. \n\n5.  What Can Be Learned from the Activity of Regional Judicial \n\nInstitutions? \n\n \n\nThe  widespread  perception  that  Asian  states  are  unusual  in  their  reluctance  to  resolve \ntheir  disputes  through  legal  means  is  at  least  partially  based  on  misconceptions  about \nthe behavior of Asian states and about the logic of regional integration elsewhere. Asian \nstates are not generally less likely than are other states to resolve their disputes through \nlegal  means.  Moreover,  regional  integration  in  other  parts  of  the  world  has  not  been \ndriven  by  legal  institutions  that  resolve  inter-state  disputes.  Indeed,  European,  Latin \nAmerican, and African states also do not sue each other in regional courts and prefer to \nresolve their differences through other means.  \n \nThese  findings  are  important  because  they  establish  that  there  is  some  potential  for \nlearning  from  the  experience  of  regional  judicial  institutions  elsewhere.  But  what  are \nthese potential lessons that could be valuable for Asian regional cooperation projects? I \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nThe Activities of Courts: Dispute Resolution and Interpretation \n\nreview the evidence by answering the questions suggested in the theory section. What \ndisputes do they resolve? What is their interpretive authority? How does the exercise of \ntheir dispute resolution and interpretive activities influence compliance, commitment, and \nchecks and balances?  I then apply these lessons to the design of a potential new Asian \njudicial institution. \n \n5.1 \n \nMost  disputes  in  front  of  regional  judicial  institutions  are  of  two  kinds.  First,  there  are \ndisputes between a treaty body, such as the European Commission, and a government, \nfor example about whether a government has correctly implemented a treaty provision. \nSuch cases constitute about one-fourth of the ECJ\u2018s caseload and less than 10% of the \nATJ  caseload  (Alter  2009).  Second,  and  much  more  commonly,  regional  judicial \ninstitutions  review  disputes  between  private  actors  and  a  government  or  a government \nagency.  These  may  be  cases  where  a  private  party  charges  that  a  government  has \nincorrectly  implemented  regional  law.  More  commonly,  these  are  cases  where  the \nrelevant law for a dispute over an administrative decision is regional rather than national \nlaw. \n \nThe  activity  of  courts  is  not  a  simple  function  of  formal  institutional  design.  Allowing \nprivate  actors  access  does  not  by  itself  ensure  that  a  court  becomes  active  (see  also \nAlter 2006) nor does granting a treaty body the authority to file infringement suits against \ngovernments  mean  that  they  will  actually  do  so  (see  Helfer  and  Alter  2009  for  the \nAndean Community). For private access to matter, two criteria need to be satisfied. First \nand  most  obvious,  there  must  be  legally  binding  regional  rules  that  create  rights  and \nobligations for private parties. This allows private parties to sue and be sued on the basis \nof regional law. A second condition is that if private access is indirect, as it is for virtually \nall  cases  other  than  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights,  there  must  be  national \ninstitutions  that  perceive  to  have  an  interest  in  referring  cases  to  the  regional  court. \nSome regional agreements require national courts to refer cases to a regional court if the \nissue  concerns  regional  law  but,  as  the  examples  below  will  illustrate,  this  does  not \nmean that this  actually  happens.  In  the  case of the  ECJ,  it  was crucially  important  that \nnational  courts  started  to  see  the  ECJ  as  an  ally  that  could  help  them  advance  their \ninterests  as  opposed  to  an  institution  that  encroached  on  their  terrain  (see  Alter  1998, \nWeiler  1994).  This  is  not  (yet)  the  case  for  national  courts  in  most  OHADA  member \nstates  (Dickerson  2005).  In  the  case  of  the  ATJ,  the  key  national  actors  were  national \nadministrative agencies charged with protecting intellectual property rights (IP) that were \nthe engines behind increased references to the regional court (Helfer and Alter 2009).  \n \nThe  ATJ  illustrates  these points  well.  Until  recent  research  by  Larry  Helfer,  Karen  Alter \nand  Florencia  Guerzovich,  little  was  known  about  the  world\u2018s  third  most  active \ninternational court (Helfer et al. 2009, Helfer and Alter 2009). The ATJ had only a minimal \ncaseload in the 1980s and early 1990s. Yet, references to the court started to increase in \n1995  due  to  two  factors.  First,  the  Andean  Community  adopted  IP  rules  that  were \nbroadly  consistent  with  the  TRIPS  rules  under  WTO.  These  rules  gave  private  actors \nrights  and  obligations  under  Andean  law.  At  the  same  time,  domestic  administrative  IP \nagencies  were  transformed  or  created.  These  agencies  were  in  charge  of  reviewing \ntrademark  and  patent  registrations.  Since  the  relevant  IP  law  was  regional  law,  they \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       17 \n\napplied  this  law  in  those  decisions.  Consequentially,  when  dissatisfied  businesses \nchallenged these administrative decisions in courts, Andean law had to be interpreted by \nnational courts. Initially most national courts were hesitant to refer such cases to the ATJ. \nYet, through various forms of pressure by IP agencies, businesses, and lawyers, courts \nin three countries (Columbia, Ecuador, and Peru) started to refer IP cases to the ATJ.30 \nSuch cases make up about 90% of the nearly 1500 judgments the ATJ has issued.  \n \nAnother  interesting  example  of  a  regional  regime  that  delegated  authority  in  a  limited \nissue  area  to  a  regional  court  is  OHADA.  OHADA  (Organization  for  Harmonization  in \nAfrica  of  Business  Laws)  is  a  system  of  business  laws  and  implementing  institutions \nadopted  by  sixteen  mostly  francophone  West  and  Central  African  nations. 31  These \ncountries  adopted  this  regime  in  1993  in  order  to  stimulate  (foreign)  investments  and \npromote  growth  (Mancuso  2006).  The  organization\u2018s  Council  of  Ministers  has  the \nauthority  to  adopt  uniform  acts  that  need  not  be  implemented  by  national  legislatures. \nMany  of  the  acts  are  based  on  draft  conventions  and  model  laws  created  by  other \norganizations,  such  as  UNIDROIT,  but  they  are  adjusted  to  reflect  Western  Africa\u2018s \nrealities. The Cour Commune de Justice et d\u2018Arbitrage  (CCJA) is an international court \nthat ensures that OHADA laws are interpreted uniformly across the membership and to \nincrease the credibility of the regional regime. Formally, the CCJA provides a forum for \ninterstate arbitration as well as a court of last resort for disputes under OHADA law that \nwere initiated within member states. Predictably, the first function remains undeveloped \n(Dickinson 2005). The second function has led to at least 274 judgments, most coming \nfrom C\u00f4te d\u2018Ivoire (the seat of the court), indicating that in reality national courts do not \nalways refer OHADA cases to the CCJA.32 Nevertheless, the regime is broadly perceived \nto be a remarkable success (Mancuso 2006). \n\n5.2  Broader Effects of Regional Judicial Institutions \n \nThe  theory  section  stipulated  that  by  exercising  their  immediate  functions  of  dispute \nresolution and treaty interpretation, regional judicial institutions could also have broader \neffects  on  regional  cooperation.  Most  notably,  they  can  help  improve  compliance  with \nregional  agreements,  increase  the  commitment  that states  have to regional  integration, \nand provide checks and balances to new international authority.  \n \nThere is regrettably little evidence that regional judicial institutions have or have not had \nsuch  broad  effects.  While  there  is  considerable  evidence  that  national  courts  have \nmostly  been  willing  to  accept  ECJ  rulings  in  individual  cases  (e.g.  Weiler  1994),  it  is \nunclear what broader effect the court has had on compliance in the EU.  It is clear that \nis  far  from  perfect.  For  example,  Mastenbroek  (2003) \nin \ncompliance \n                                            \n\n30  See Helfer and Alter 2009 for the more precise story on the mechanisms in each country and also for a \n\nthe  EU \n\npreliminary account of why the same trend has not happened in Bolivia and Venezuela. \n\n31  The Western African members are: Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2018Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, \nNiger,  Senegal,  and  Togo.  The  Central  African  members  are  Central  African  Republic,  Chad, \nCameroon, Comores, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. \n\n32  Alter 2009. Private parties may also not always insist on this, given the expense of proceedings in a \nanother country (Dickerson 2005). There are hundreds more rulings on OHADA law that are decided in \nnational courts. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\ndemonstrates that even in the Netherlands, a country widely praised for its compliance \nwith international  law,  only  40  percent  of  EU  directives are  implemented  on time.  More \ngenerally,  research  about  compliance  with  EU  law  and  the  ECJ\u2018s  role  in this  is  fraught \nwith  data  and  methodological  differences  (e.g.  B\u00f6rzel  2001,  Tallberg  2002).  To  make \nmatters  worse,  Carrubba et  al. (2008) find  evidence  that the  ECJ  may take  anticipated \ncompliance into account in its decision making process. To my knowledge, there are no \nsystematic studies of compliance with the ECtHR or other regional courts. \n \nThe  effect  on  commitment  can  only  be  gleaned  anecdotally.  While  there  are  many \nexamples  of  failed  regional  integration  projects  (see  Mattli  1999),  I  am  not  aware  of  a \nregional integration scheme that collapsed after it has had an active regional court. The \npossible exception is the Central American Court of Justice, which issued ten decisions \nbetween  1908  and  1916.  Cases  of  countries  withdrawing  from  the  jurisdiction  of  an \nactive  regional  court  are  also  few  and  far  between.  The  withdrawal  of  Trinidad  and \nTobago from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights over the issue \nof  the  death  penalty  is  the  most  prominent  example that  comes  to mind  (Helfer  2002). \nYet,  it  is  impossible  to  assert  what  the  causal  role  of  regional  courts  is  in  keeping  a \nregional integration project going. \n \nThere  is  anecdotal  evidence  that  regional  courts  have  had  commitment  benefits,  in \nunanticipated  ways  that  may  be  attractive  for  Asian  states.  For  example,  Helfer  et  al. \n2009  document  how  the  distinct  Andean  interpretation  of  IP  law,  which  had  been \ninfluenced  by  national  IP  agencies,  strengthened  the  Peruvian  negotiation  position  in \nbilateral  bargaining  with  the  United  States  as  it  allowed  the  Peruvian  delegation  to \ncredibly claim that they could not make certain concessions given that those would be in \nviolation of Andean law. Given that Andean law cannot be changed by Peru unilaterally, \nthis  commitment  device may  work rather  well.  In  this  sense, then,  opting for  a  regional \nlegal  regime  may  be  a  way  of  implementing  legal  obligations  in  a  manner  that  stays \ncloser to home than it would be in the absence of such a regime.  \n \nThe  effect  on  checks  and  balances  is  clearer,  albeit  almost  entirely  build  on  qualitative \nevidence (e.g. Weiler 1994, Mattli and Slaughter 1998). A recent interesting exercise in \nchecks  and  balances  came  in  the  ECJ\u2018s  recent  Kadi  decision33,  which  invalidated  the \nEU\u2018s  implementation  of  a  Security  Council  resolution  that  requires  the  financial \nmeasures  against  persons  linked  to  a  terrorist  organization,  as  determined  by  a  UN \nSanctions  Committee.    The  Kadi  decision  essentially  argues  that  persons  had  no \neffective  legal  remedy  to  challenge  their  placement  on  the  list  and  thus  the  freezing  of \ntheir  bank  accounts.  This  is  a  remarkable  example  in  checking  the  exercise  of \ninternational authority over individuals. \n \nMore  generally,  it  has  proven  difficult  to  examine  empirically  to  what  extent  regional \njudicial  institutions  have  indeed  increased  transnational  economic  activity.  Kono (2008) \nfinds that the presence of inter-state DSMs appears to stimulate regional trade but that \nthere is no evidence that enhancing the legalistic features of this process have had any \neffect. Stone Sweet and Brunell (1998) find evidence that ECJ activity is both driven by \n\n                                            \n\n33  Joined Cases C-402/05 P and C-415/05 P. \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       19 \n\nInstitutional Implications for Asia \n\nand drives transnational economic activity. There are no studies that I know of that show \nthat  OHADA  has  or  has  not  increased  (foreign)  investment  or  whether  the  Andean  IP \nregime has improved innovation. One piece of evidence cited by OHADA scholars is that \nadditional  states  are  eager  to  join  the  organization  (Mancuso  2007).  The  same  is \nobviously true for the EU but less so for the Andean Pact. \n \n5.3 \n \nWhat do these lessons mean for a potential judicial institution that could  help stimulate \ntransnational  economic  activity  in  Asia?  It  would  be  unwise  to  transplant  one  of  the \nexisting  regional  judicial  institutions  to  Asia.  Outright  copying  of  formal  institutional \nstructure is common but rarely successful (Alter 2009). Yet, there are some lessons that \ncould be learned. The most obvious negative one is that an institution that focuses solely \non resolving inter-state disputes is unlikely to contribute much. There are few downsides \nto having a formal inter-state dispute settlement mechanism, such as ASEAN\u2018s, but it is \nnot  clear  that  such  a  mechanism  will  have  significant  effects  either.  A  second  negative \nconclusion is that given the present institutional structure, it would be unwise to create a \ncourt  that  primarily  aims  to  reduce  deliberate  non-compliance  by  member  states.  Such \ncourts  can  only  function  effectively  in  the  presence  of  a  strong  supranational \nbureaucracy that can file infringement suits. \n \nThe most straightforward answer to the question why there are no active standing Asian \ncourts  is  that  there  are  few  if  any  regional  rules  that  create  rights  and  obligations  for \nprivate parties. To some extent this is answering a question by positing a different one: \nwhy  are  such  rules  absent?  I  suggest  two  answers.  First,  heterogeneity  within  Asia  is \ngreater than in other regions. This is true even within the most developed sub-regional \ninstitution: ASEAN. This diversity makes it difficult to coordinate on regulations that are \nappropriate across a region or sub-region. Second, many Asian states have traditionally \nbeen characterized as \u2015developmental states,\u2016 which seek to exercise social and political \ncontrol  over  business  through  informal  means  rather  than  through  independent \nregulatory  agencies  that  are  delegated  the  authority  to  apply  a  well-defined  body  of \nformal law (e.g. Woo-Cumings 1999).  Recently, scholars have argued that several Asian \ncountries are moving  towards  a regulatory  state  model  (e.g.  Ginsburg  and  Chen 2008, \nJayasurya 2007, Pearson 2005). This trend is at least partially a response to economic \ninterdependence  and  membership  in  international  regimes  (Ginsburg  and  Chen  2008), \nas  it  was  in  Europe  (Majone  1994).  Such  reforms  create  a  demand  for  administrative \nreview  as  both  governments  and  private  actors  become  increasingly  concerned  that \nagencies are unable to implement the new rules well or even that they might abuse their \nauthority.   \n \nAlthough regional law plays a limited role in Asian administrative review, a regional court \ncould aid national courts and administrative agencies in areas where global international \nlegal  obligations  are  already  important.  Asian  countries  are  party  to  various multilateral \ntreaties  that  create  obligations  vis-\u00e0-vis  private  parties.  Although  there  are  no  regional \nrules  on  government  procurement,  several  Asian  states  are  part  of  the  WTO's \nGovernment Procurement Agreement (Hsu 2006). The WTO\u2018s intellectual property rights \nregime (TRIPS) also has important implications for regulatory regimes. Moreover, many \nAsian  states  are  actively  seeking  to  bring  their  business  law  in  accordance  with \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\ninternational  standards.  All  major  Asian  economies  are  members  of  UNIDROIT34 and \nmany  are  signatories  to  its  conventions  that  seek  to  unify  private  law.  Several  Asian \nstates are members of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HccH) and \nare  parties  to  its  various  conventions.35 Asian  states  are  also  active  in  UNCITRAL,  the \nUN  body  that  seeks  to  harmonize  and  modernize  international  business  law  through \nconventions and model laws. \n \nThere  is  some  evidence  that  Asian  countries  have  increased  such  commitments  in \nrecent years. For example after long remaining outside the regime, South Korea (2005) \nand Japan (2009) are the latest major trading powers to join the 1980 UN Convention on \nContracts  for the International  Sale of  Goods (CISG),36 leaving  Brazil,  India, the  United \nKingdom, and South Africa as the only major trading countries that have not signed what \nis  arguably  the  most  successful  international  contract  treaty.  Another  example  was \ndiscussed  earlier  in  this  paper:  the  frequency  with  which  Asian  countries  are  willing  to \ndelegate  authority  to  ICSID  to  arbitrate  in  investment  disputes  between  private  parties \nand the government. \n \nIn  short,  several  Asian  states  appear  increasingly  willing  to  make  international  legal \ncommitments  that  create  obligations  vis-\u00e0-vis  private  parties.  Moreover,  they  have \nrecognized that harmonization of commercial law is desirable. Even if this has not led to \nnew regional law, a regional judicial institution could improve the uniform implementation \nof  those  existing  international  legal  commitments,  improve  the  perceived  commitments \ntowards \nlegal  rules,  and  create \nby  Asian  states \nharmonization. The suggestion is to create a judicial institution that can, at the request of \nnational courts or administrative agencies, offer advisory opinions on the interpretation of \ninternational  rules,  laws,  and  standards  that  are  already  applicable.  The  assumption  is \nthat  governments  want  to  see  those  obligations  implemented  but  that  national \nadministrative  agencies  or  courts  may  not  always  be  well-equipped  to  do  so.  While  a \ncomplete proposal for a new judicial institution is beyond the scope of this working paper, \nI want to offer some thoughts and suggestions as to what such an institution could look \nlike and could reasonably seek to accomplish. \n \n\nfurther  momentum \n\nthose \n\nto \n\n\uf0b7  The new institution would issue advisory opinions on a well-defined set of treaties \nand  conventions  that  countries  have  already  ratified. 37  It  would  leave  the \nresolution  of  disputes  to  the  national  courts.  This  is  appropriate  as  actual \ndisputes  often  involve  a  mixture  of  domestic  and  international  legal  issues  that \ncan be better assessed by local courts. This may also alleviate some sovereignty \nconcerns.  It  would  specifically  not  be  within  the  mandate  of  this  institution  to \ninterpret domestic law or make judgments as to whether domestic law contradicts \n\n                                            \n\n34  http://www.unidroit.org/english/members/main.htm. \n35  http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=states.listing.  \n36  They  were  the  only  major  countries  that  signed  in  this  period:  http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/ \n\nen/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1980CISG_status.html. \n\n37  The determination of the set of treaties and conventions that are relevant here should be determined \n\nby legal experts. States should then be able to choose among that list. \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       21 \n\ninternational legal obligations. Such determinations are left to the national review \nprocess. \n\n\uf0b7  The judicial institution would be composed of experts of international commercial \nand business law. It could be hosted by the Asian Development Bank as part of \nits technical assistance mission. Indeed, the ADB already supports business law \nreform  through  this  program.38 A  first  step  could  be  the  creation  of  a  working \ngroup  of  legal  experts  to  investigate  the  sensibility  of  and  demand  for  such  an \ninstitution  or  other  ways  the  ADB  could  help  promote  the  harmonization  of \nbusiness law.  \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nI suggest an optional protocol that if ratified would give any party to a dispute in \nthat  country  the  right  to  refer  a  question  about  the  appropriate  interpretation  of \ninternational law to the new judicial institution. It might make sense to limit this to \ndisputes  before  appellate  courts.  Ratifying  such  a  protocol  would  signal  a \ncommitment  to  uniform  application  of  international  obligations.  I  propose  that \ngovernments that have not signed the optional protocol may still request advisory \nopinions in certain circumstances (perhaps on a pay-per-use basis). Such usage \nwould  obviously  not  send  the  same  commitment  but  could  well  contribute  to \nuniform interpretation. \n\n\uf0b7  Since many of the laws that this institution would interpret are global in nature, it \nmay  seem  odd  to  design  a  regional  institution  to  interpret  them.  First,  other \nregions  already  have  judicial  institutions  that,  among  others,  interpret  the  laws \nunder  discussion  here.  Given  this,  they  would  have  little  impetus  in  partaking. \nSecond, international legal obligations are interpreted in a context. For example, \nCISG obligations have been interpreted differently in countries with different legal \ncultures  and  developmental  status  (Ryan  1996).  Although  Asia  is  a  large  and \nextremely diverse continent, the world is bigger and even more diverse. There is \na demand for Asian cooperation that is at least partially driven by the perception \nthat  there  are  a  set  of  common  development  challenges.  Moreover,  given  high \nlevels of intra-Asian trade, the benefits of uniform interpretation within Asia might \nencourage  more  Asian  states  to  sign  on  to  the  various  conventions  that  are \nalready open for signature. Third, the institution may serve as a model or impetus \nfor future innovation. It does not create new legal obligations but it could create a \nframework  for  future  Asian  conventions  towards  harmonizing  business  laws. \nFourth, by not integrating the institution into one of the existing regional initiatives, \nit  provides  a  model  for  harmonization  that  recognizes  the  enormous  diversity \namong Asian states. Each state could sign on at its own pace and based on the \nconventions it has ratified. The model provides incentives towards harmonization \nbut creates no obligations. \n\n\uf0b7  The  idea  is  not  to  create  another  institution  for  international  commercial \narbitration.  There  are  two  important  limits  to  arbitration.  First,  as  noted  in  the \ntheory  section,  arbitral  tribunals  have  limited  capacity  to  clarify  the  meaning  of \n\n                                            \n\n38  See  for  example  \u2015Technical  Assistance  Solomon  Islands:  Supporting  Business  Law  Reform\u2016  Project \n\nNumber: 38151: http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/SOL/38151-SOL-TAR.pdf. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nlegal obligations and thus do not contribute to their uniform interpretation. Indeed, \nit is plausible that the new institution could contribute to the uniform interpretation \nof the law by arbitral tribunals, which is a big issue in the arbitration literature (i.e. \narbitral  tribunals  tend  to  be  inconsistent  in  their  interpretation  of  legal  rules, \ncontributing to uncertainty).  For example, CISG is regularly interpreted in courts \nand  arbitral  tribunals 39  but  their  interpretations  have  diverged  considerably; \nlimiting  the  treaty\u2018s  intended  unifying  effects  (Ryan  1996).  Second,  international \ncommercial arbitration is usually accessible only to large foreign investors; often \nonly investors from certain countries. This regime is therefore frequently criticized \nfor  creating  different  rights  for  different  investors.  While  large  foreign  investors \nare important, economic development is driven as well by smaller investors and \ndomestic actors.  \n\n\uf0b7  The  judicial  institution  operates  on  the  assumption  that  governments  are \ninterested  in  assuring  that  their  international  legal  obligations  are  implemented \nand  interpreted  in  a  uniform  way  across  the  region.  Domestic  courts  and \nregulatory  agencies  are  already  regularly  asked  to  interpret  international  rules, \nstandards  and  regulations.  They  may  be  ill-equipped  to  do  so.  The  judicial \ninstitution seeks to rectify this problem. The institution is not based on the naive \nassumption  that  deliberate  non-compliance  is  not  a  problem  but  does  assume \nthat  progress  can  be  made  by  improving  implementation  and  coordination  in \nareas where governments do want to comply.  \n \n \nConclusion \n\n6. \n\n \n\nEffective regional judicial institutions perform two core tasks that can stimulate economic \nactivity:  they  resolve  disputes  in  efficient  and  impartial  ways  and  they  coordinate  the \ninterpretation of laws and treaties. In so doing, they could also have broader effects on \nregional  cooperation  such  as  improving  incentives  for  compliance,  increasing  the \nperceived commitment of parties to a regional integration project, and contributing to the \nimplementation of agreements. The analyses in this paper demonstrate that Asian states \nhave not foregone these theoretical advantages because they are inherently adverse to \nlegalized  dispute  resolution.  Moreover,  their  reluctance  to  resolve  inter-state  disputes \nthrough regional judicial institutions is shared by states in other regions. \n \nThe examples of the Andean Community and OHADA illustrate that it is possible to use \na  regional  court  to  help  harmonize  narrow  areas  of  law  relevant  for  transnational \neconomic  activity  without  creating  a  powerful  supranational  bureaucracy. 40 Moreover, \nthese examples demonstrate that national institutions still play a major role in the extent \nto  which  such  a  regional  court  becomes  active  in  a  country,  perhaps  alleviating  some \nconcerns  about  sovereignty  costs  and  that  Asian  states  are  too  diverse  to  effectively \nharmonize  laws.  These  courts  mostly  review  decisions  by  administrative  agencies  that \n                                            \n\n39  For a database, see: http://www.unilex.info/.  \n40  Some international bureaucracy is required but such a bureaucracy need not have the power to issue \n\nbinding directives, as in the case of the European Commission. \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       23 \n\naffect private actors. National courts may lack the expertise to review such administrative \ndecisions  and/or  the  law  may  be  regional  in  character,  as  is  the  case  with  intellectual \nproperty  rights  law,  which  operates  in  the  shadow  of  the  WTO  regime.  Unlike  with  the \nresolution of inter-state disputes, there is no particular reason why a regional court of this \ntype  would  interfere  with  political  or  consensual  forms  of  dispute  resolution  between \nstates. Yet, the theoretical benefits of harmonizing (and presumably improving the quality \nof) areas of corporate law could be substantial.  \n \nNeither the ATJ nor the CCJA are exemplary in their functioning. Indeed, the conditions \nfor an effective regional court of this type may well be better in Asia, although there are \nalso some obstacles. For example, OHADA was greatly helped by the fact that virtually \nall of its member states had similar laws on the book that were inherited from the French. \nAsian  countries  are more  diverse  in  this  regard. As  such, the most  suitable candidates \nmay  be  areas  of law  where  international  obligations  already  play  a major role,  such  as \nintellectual property rights and investment law.  There may also be political advantages \nto  developing  a  distinct  Asian  jurisprudence  in  such  areas  given  that  these  issues  are \nbound  to  emerge  in  future  rounds  of  WTO  negotiations  or  in  bilateral  trade  and \ninvestment treaty negotiations. The institutional innovation suggested in this paper seeks \nto improve the way existing legal obligations are implemented throughout Asia, thereby \ncontributing to a greater uniformity and predictability in the laws under which businesses \nthat engage in transnational economic activity operate.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n24          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nTable 1: Trade Dispute Initiation  \n\nVariable \n\nDeveloping Countries \n\nDeveloped Countries \n\n-.16 (.37) \n\n-.01 (.00)** \n\n.50 (.22)** \n\n1.67 (.60)*** \n\n-.99 (.59)* \n\n1.31 (.41)*** \n\n.58 (.16)*** \n\n-29.04 (6.55) \n\n.32 (.08) \n\n543 \n\nAsia \n\n.38 (.39) \n\nPrevious Initiations \n\n.09 (.03)*** \n\nDemocracy \n\nLog GDP \n\nLog Population \n\nEnglish \n\nWTO Period \n\nConstant \n\n.19 (.09)** \n\n1.00 (.24)*** \n\n-.48 (-.22)** \n\n-.31 (.32) \n\n-.08 (.26) \n\n-18.80 (3.22) \n\nDispersion parameter \n\n.74 (.17) \n\nN \n\n1314 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         *p<.10, **p<.05, ***p<.01 (two-tailed).  \n \n         Source: Davis and Bermeo 2009, Tables 2 and 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       25 \n\nTable 2: Ordered Probit Results for Delegation to Delegate Dispute \nSettlement to ICSID  \n\n \n\nVariable \n\nCoefficient (Robust S.E.) \n\nAsian Home Country \n\nAsian Host Country \n\nBoth Asian Countries \n\n \nPresence of MNCs in Home  \n\nStrength of Legal Institutions in Home  \n\nStrength of Legal Institutions in Host  \n\nDurability of Host Regime \n\nPolitical Constraints on Executive in Host  \n\nAlliance Ties  \n\nColonial Ties  \n\nHost Recently Independent  \n\nDomestic Economic Growth Host \n\nExport Dependence Host  \n\n.48 (.17)*** \n\n.18 (.10)* \n\n-.18 ( .29) \n\n \n1.83 (.72)*** \n\n.13 (.04)*** \n\n.03 (.04) \n\n-.00 ( .00) \n\n.38 (.19)* \n\n-.05 (.08) \n\n-.12 (.12) \n\n-.28 (.10) \n\n-.00 ( .00) \n\n.00 (.00)** \n\n.77 (.39)** \n\n.02 (.08) \n\nReliance on External Financial Assistance Host  \n\nRight Wing Government Host \n\nRatio of Home to Host Economic Power \n\n.66 (.16)*** \n\n \nN = 1032 Bilateral Investment Treaties, *p<.10, **p<.05, ***p<.01 (two-tailed).Wald \u03c72 test (16df) = 97.12 (.00)  \n \n\n          Source: Allee and Peinhardt, Table 2. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n26          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n\nTable 3: Multinomial Logit Results for the Outcomes of Rounds of Talks \nover Disputed Territory  \n\nLegal Dispute Settlement  \nvs. Bilateral Concessions \n\nLegal Dispute Settlement  \nvs. Stalemate \n\nAsian involvement \n\nBoth countries Asian \n\n-.27 (1.06) \n\n.22 (1.24) \n\nStrong domestic political opposition \n\n1.36 (.48)*** \n\nDemocratic dyad (accountability) \n\n1.35 (.60)*** \n\nEthnic ties with territory \n\nEnduring rivals \n\n.92 (.41)*** \n\n1.54 (.70)*** \n\nHard-line stance in previous negotiations \n\n.02 (.20) \n\nDemocratic dyad (norms) \n\n-.70 (.65) \n\nCommon security ties \n\nStrategic value of territory \n\n.60 (.43) \n\n-.64 (.58) \n\n-.55 (1.05) \n\n.40 (1.22) \n\n.95 (.47)*** \n\n1.29 (.58)*** \n\n.89 (.46)** \n\n1.20 (.67)* \n\n-.47 (.19)*** \n\n-.31 (61) \n\n.62 (.42) \n\n-.75 (.57) \n\nMilitary asymmetry \n\n-3.64 (1.48)*** \n\n-4.60 (1.46)*** \n\nConstant \n\n-3.02 (.51)*** \n\n-3.36 (.50)*** \n\n \nNote: N = 1490.

What \nlessons from elsewhere could be valuable to Asian regional economic integration? This paper\nshows that Asian states are not unusually averse to refer inter-state disputes to global\n judicial institutions. Moreover, Asian states are not unique in their reluctance to resolve \nregional inter-state disputes through judicial means. The most valuable lesson for Asia from \nexperiences elsewhere is the role that regional courts can play in resolving disputes between \nadministrative agencies and private parties about the implementation of international law.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on \nless than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \n\ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No. \n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration \n \n \n \n \n \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: \nLessons for Asia? \n \n  \n", "Erik Voeten+ \n \nNo. 65     November 2010 \n", " \n", "This  is  a  background  paper  prepared  for  the \nADB flagship study \u2015Institutions for Regionalism: \nEnhancing  Cooperation  and  Integration  in  Asia \nand  the  Pacific,\u2016  under  technical  assistance \nproject no. 7284. \n", "The author thanks Todd Allee, Karen Alter, Mely \nCaballero  Anthony,  Barry  Eichengreen,  Larry \nHelfer,  Denis  Hew,  Locknie  Hsu,  Miles  Kahler, \nClint  Peinhardt  and  Tan  See  Seng  for  sharing \ndata  and  suggestions  that  have  helped \nto \nimprove this paper. \n+Erik  Voeten \nis  Peter  F.
