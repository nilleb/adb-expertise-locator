What \nlessons from the operation of such institutions elsewhere could be valuable to Asian \nregional economic integration? I show that Asian states are not unusually averse to refer \ninter-state disputes over trade, investment, and territory to global judicial institutions. \nMoreover, Asian states are not unique in their reluctance to resolve regional inter-state \ndisputes through judicial means: Regional judicial institutions elsewhere have also rarely \nbeen  used  to  resolve  inter-state  disputes. The  most  valuable  lesson  for Asia  from \nexperiences elsewhere is the role that regional courts can play in resolving disputes \nbetween  administrative  agencies  and  private  parties  about  the  implementation  of \ninternational law. While Asia lacks an extensive set of regional laws and regulations that \ncreate rights and obligations for private parties, there is a broad body of international law \nthat already applies in many Asian countries. National administrative agencies or courts \nmay not always be well-equipped to interpret this law. I suggest the creation of a regional \njudicial institution that contributes to the uniform application of this law and that may help \nsignal  the  commitment  of  states  to  their  international  obligations.  The  proposed \ninstitution provides incentives for harmonization without creating new obligations, thus \nrecognizing the diversity among Asian states. \n \nKeywords: regional judicial institutions, regional economic integration, Asia \n \nJEL Classification: F50, F51, F53, F55 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       1 \n1.  Introduction \n \nThe absence of regional judicial institutions in Asia is one of the most striking differences \nbetween its regional economic integration projects and those elsewhere. While Asia has \nno active standing regional court, Europe, Latin America, and Africa each have at least \nfour active regional courts that have issued thousands of legally binding judgments.1 \nAbout 90% of these judgments have come since 1990 (Alter 2009). This increased \nusage stems not just from Europe but also from the Americas and even Africa. These \ntrends are backed by an emerging consensus on the centrality of legal institutions for \neconomic development (e.g. Dixit 2009).  \n \nWhy is Asia lagging behind other regions in this regard? And, what is Asian regional \neconomic integration and cooperation missing by not partaking in this trend? This paper \nfirst discusses the theoretical reasons why regional judicial institutions could enhance \neconomic integration and cooperation. It then turns to the question why Asian regional \ncooperation projects have decided (until now) to forego these theoretical advantages. A \nprevalent hypothesis among scholars and policymakers is that Asia has opted for a \nmodel of cooperation without legalization because Asian states are inherently averse to \nlegalized dispute resolution for cultural or institutional reasons.  So far, however, this \nproposition has not been systematically tested. Using data and models from studies \npublished in top peer-reviewed journals, I find no evidence that Asian states are less \nlikely than other states to refer trade, investment, or territorial disputes to global judicial \ninstitutions. This also holds for inter-Asian disputes. \n \nA slightly different argument is that Asian regional cooperation projects have a distinct \nsocial  logic  that  prescribe  consensual  as  opposed  to  legalized  forms  of  dispute \nresolution between states. This is, however, mostly based on a misconception about the \nnature of regional integration elsewhere. While regional inter-state dispute resolution \nmechanisms  are  ubiquitous,  they  are  rarely  used  by  states  involved  in  a  regional \nintegration project. Resolving inter-state disputes is not and has not been the main \ncontribution of regional judicial institutions. \n \nInstead, the lessons from regional courts elsewhere suggest that they become active \n2\nengines of integration if two conditions are present.  First, and most important, there \nmust be legally binding regional rules that create rights and obligations for private parties. \nThis allows private parties to sue and be sued on the basis of international law. Second, \nthere  must  be  an  institutional  configuration  that  allows  private  parties  access  to  a \nregional court. This can be direct (such as in the case of the European Court of Human \nRights) or indirect through references by national courts. National courts could decide to \nresolve  disputes  over  the  implementation  of  regional  rules  without  reference  to  a \nregional court. Yet, there are instances where they are obliged to do so or when it is in \ntheir interest to do so. In such cases, regional courts can contribute to the harmonization \nof laws, rules, and practices, which in turn may stimulate transnational economic activity.  \n                                            \n1  Alter (2009) finds evidence of almost 30,000 rulings issued by standing international courts until 2007. \nAbout 90% of these rulings come from regional courts. This number does not include rulings by \narbitration panels or non-permanent courts. \n2  For a similar argument, see Alter (2009). \n ", " \n2          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nWhile Asia has few regional treaties that create legal obligations and rights for private \nparties, there is a broad body of international trade and commercial law that is already \nrelevant. I suggest that a judicial institution could be created that can, at the request of \nnational courts or administrative agencies, offer advisory opinions on the interpretation of \ninternational  rules,  laws,  and  standards  that  are  already  applicable.  The  underlying \nassumption is that governments want to see those obligations implemented but that \nnational administrative agencies or courts may not always be well-equipped to do so. \nThe new institution would allow Asian states to send a signal that they are committed to \ntake  their  legal  obligations  seriously.  Moreover,  it  would  contribute  to  the  uniform \napplication (and thus harmonization) of commercial law while allowing each state to \nmake new obligations at their own pace. The concluding sections offer some thoughts on \npolitical feasibility, issues of institutional design, and expected effects. \n \n \n2.  How Could Regional Judicial Institutions Promote \nEconomic Integration? \n \nIn what way could regional judicial institutions contribute to economic integration and \ncooperation?  Regional economic  cooperation refers  to cooperative  policies  such  as \nsharing technology, reducing trade barriers, and otherwise facilitating market access for \nregional  parties.  Regional  economic  integration  also  implies  harmonization  or \nstandardization of laws and regulations across countries. Cooperation and integration \nare ultimately aimed at increasing economic transactions. Judicial institutions address \ntwo immediate problems that arise in any such project: dispute resolution and rule \ninterpretation. These activities may have broader effects by improving compliance with, \ncommitment  to,  and  implementation  of  regional  agreements.  This  section  briefly \ndiscusses each in turn. \n \n2.1  Dispute Resolution \n \nAn increase in economic transactions also increases the probability that disputes arise \nbetween governments and/or private parties across borders. The expectation that such \ndisputes are resolved in an impartial and efficient way by third parties both increases the \nlikelihood that contracts are entered into and the likelihood that transactions continue in \nthe aftermath of disputes. The ability to adjudicate disputes is central to courts around \nthe world. The minimal institutional design requirements for effective dispute resolution \nare limited. The ideal-typical model requires primarily that the third actor who resolves a \ndispute is impartial and that there are few impediments to utilizing the dispute resolution \nmechanism (Shapiro 1981). \n \nThese requirements do not necessarily imply a standing court but could be achieved with \narbitration. In its most basic version, two parties both agree to submit a dispute to a third \nparty and make some promise to accept the third party\u2018s ruling. In most cases, however, \nstates agree ex ante (through a treaty) that certain actors (other states, foreign investors) \nhave a right to sue them in a particular forum.  This is a delegation of authority with \nsovereignty costs attached to it. The motivation for states to do so is that by granting the \nright to be sued they expect increased trade and/or investment in the same way that the \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       3 \nright to be sued is essential for business to enter into contracts.  In most arbitral models, \neach party appoints one panelist. These two panelists appoint the third one with mutual \nconsent. This model is especially prevalent in the resolution of investment disputes, \noften done under the auspices of a standard set of procedures, such as those stipulated \nby the World Bank\u2018s International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes \n(ICSID). It is also used in some regional trade disputes, such as NAFTA\u2018s binational \nreview panels. Other treaties create permanent dispute settlement bodies, meaning that \nstates have less control over panel composition.  \n \nThere is some controversy over whether creating dispute settlement bodies actually \nincreases trade (see Rose 2004, Tomz et al 2007) or investment (see B\u00fcthe and Milner \n2009), although all of this evidence is from bilateral treaty membership or GATT/WTO \nrather than for regional agreements.  There is strong evidence that domestic courts that \nresolve simple economic disputes in an efficient manner stimulate economic activity (e.g. \nDjankov  et  al  2003).    It  is  unclear,  however,  to  what  extent  international  dispute \nresolution mechanisms fit this paradigm. Indeed, much of the criticism targeted at the \nWTO dispute resolution mechanism argues that developing countries lack the legal \ncapacity to pursue cases effectively and that this deters them from initiating disputes (e.g. \nBusch et al 2009, Davis and Bermeo 2009).  \n \n2.2  Interpretation \n \nAttempts to standardize rules, regulations, and laws across countries can only contribute \nto increased economic activity if the agreements that establish such standardization are \nsimilarly translated into national laws, rules, and practices. Regional courts can play an \nimportant  role  in  ensuring  a  uniform  interpretation  of  regional  agreements  across \nmember states. All courts engage in interpretational activities of some sort. At a minimum, \ncourts must make a judgment on how a particular case fits the law. Yet, treaties are \nalways incomplete or imprecise. Consequently, courts frequently make determinations \nabout  precisely  how  a  treaty  should  be  interpreted.  These  determinations  do  not \nnecessarily match the desires of the states that created the treaty. Such interpretations \ncan have broad impact, especially if other courts or panels rely on them.  \n \nThis latter point is worth elaborating on. There is no formal principle of stare decisis in \ninternational law. Most international tribunals are asked to limit their focus to the dispute \nat hand. For example, article 59 of the ICJ\u2018s Statute proclaims that \u2015The decision of the \nCourt has no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular \ncase\u2016 (ICJ Statute, Article 59). Yet, the ICJ motivates its resolution of disputes with \nextensive  references  to  its  past  opinions  and  considers  these  as  precedent \n(Shahabuddeen 2007). De facto norms of stare decisis are operative at the WTO (e.g. \nBusch 2007). Similarly, the ECJ and the ECtHR rely heavily on their past decisions, have \nno trepidations in referring to these decisions as \u2015precedent\u2016 (e.g. Wildhaber 2000) and \n3\nhave developed elaborate systems to keep track of their case-law.   \n \n \n                                            \n3  For example, the ECtHR\u2018s case law on-line system Hudoc documents the \u2015Strasbourg law\u2016 each \ndecision relies on. Similarly, EUR-Lex documents the case-law for the ECJ. \n ", " \n4          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nThat norms resembling stare decisis have developed on international courts should not \nbe surprising and partially follows from their dispute settlement roles. Courts need to tell \nthe losing parties why they lost. In all modern societies, judges tell the loser: \"You did not \nlose because we the judges chose that you should lose. You lost because the law \nrequired that you should lose\" (Shapiro 1994).  Such justification is essential to establish \nthe perception that a tribunal is impartial. Demonstrating the consistency of a decision \nwith past decisions may alleviate the losing party\u2018s potential to claim that a decision was \nwhimsical or motivated by non-legal considerations (e.g. Shapiro 1981, Stone Sweet \n2002). Concerns about justification are perhaps even stronger on international courts, \nwhich generally operate in a more uncertain compliance environment than domestic \n4\ncourts.   \n \nAlthough all international judicial institutions engage in treaty interpretation of some sort, \nthere is large variation in how far-reaching their authority is in this regard. Some arbitral \ndecisions are not public and thus cannot contribute to uniform interpretation. Other \nregional courts are merely allowed to give non-binding advisory opinions to states and at \nthe request of states. Such opinions could have a broad effect only if they are accepted \nby states. Yet other institutions have constitutional review authority; including the ability \n5\nto nullify domestic laws that are in violation of a regional agreement.  Some courts also \nhave  administrative  review  roles,  evaluating  complaints  by  private  actors  that \n6\ngovernment agencies have failed to properly implement a regional treaty.  For such \ncourts to function properly, they must have compulsory jurisdiction and allow private \naccess, either through a system of preliminary references by national courts or directly.  \n \nThe key quality that a court should have to exercise its interpretive function is expertise. \nIndeed, there is some evidence that administrative agencies and national courts refer \ndecisions to regional courts because the national courts lack expertise in a certain area, \nsuch as intellectual property rights law (Helfer and Alter 2009). In addition judges should \nhave incentives to issue rulings according to their expertise as opposed to concerns \nabout the future of their careers or the desires of the governments who may have \nappointed them (Voeten 2008, 2009). This requires some independence on the part of \njudges, at least to the degree that judges should believe that states will not interfere in a \nparticular  case  or  will  punish  them  for  interpreting  a  treaty  in  a  manner  that  is \ninconsistent with the wishes of a government. \n \n                                            \n4  At least in comparison to domestic courts in developed democracies. There are, of course, numerous \ndomestic courts who operate in a weaker compliance environment than, say, the ECJ. There may also \nbe reasons that norms to adhere to past precedent are not quite as strong in international courts. For \nexample, the ECtHR has developed a \u2015margin of appreciation\u2016 doctrine, which posits that countries \nshould have some leeway in how they implement their Convention obligations into their specific \ndomestic contexts (e.g. Yourow 1996). This leaves judges some room to motivate deviations from \ncase-law with reference to specific national circumstances. \n5  Nullification is not always a direct consequence of a regional court\u2018s actions. For example, the ECtHR \ncan find that a domestic law is in violation of the ECHR but this does not automatically imply that the \ndomestic law is nullified. It does, however, imply that future litigants can expect the same outcome of \nchallenges to the domestic law, giving governments incentives to change the law. \n6  See Alter 2009 on the distinction between constitutional and administrative review roles. \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       5 \n2.3  Compliance \n \nTheories of international cooperation stipulate that fear of non-compliance is one of the \nmain  issues  that  stifles  potentially  beneficial  cooperation  between  states.  This  is \nespecially so in Prisoner-dilemma type situations, where governments do not engage in \nmutually beneficial cooperation because they fear that they will be the ones to take \ncostly  measures  to  implement  regional  agreements,  leaving  others  to  benefit.  The \npresence of a regional judicial institution could help in this regard even at the negotiation \nstage. If states expect enforcement, they may be more careful to construct regional \nagreements  that  they  expect  to  comply  with  (e.g.  Fearon  1998).  This  may  not \nnecessarily increase the volume of regional agreements but should increase their quality. \n \nAll courts aim to increase compliance to some degree, hoping that the shadow of binding \njudicial enforcement makes it more likely that states comply with agreed upon rules. Yet, \nthe prospect of a costly law suit by another state may not be sufficient incentive for \ncompliance. Legalized dispute resolution between states is an indirect way to resolve \ntrade disputes. The parties that directly benefit from or are hurt by unfair trade practices \nare generally firms. Firms lobby their governments in order to convince them that it is \nalso in their interest to incur the economic and political cost of launching a dispute \nagainst another government. These political costs may be especially high in the context \nof a regional integration project. It may not seem credible that a global institution such as \nthe WTO has a bias for or against (for example) Malaysia or Indonesia. Yet, such \ncharges are more likely in a context where there are few actors with well-understood \nhistories  and  cleavages.  Regional  institutions  generally  serve  other  purposes  than \nresolving disputes. Potential charges of bias in the resolution of contentious disputes \nmay have negative spillover effects to the workings of these institutions. Indeed, the data \nwill show that regional courts embedded in larger integration projects are rarely used to \nresolve inter-state disputes.  \n \nSome regional agreements address compliance more directly, by creating a treaty body \nthat monitors compliance by member states and can file infringement or non-compliance \ncases with a regional court. Examples are the European commission, but also the \nAndean Community and other regional organizations have such treaty bodies (see Alter \n2009, Ch. 2 for an overview). Others allow private actors direct access, either directly \n(the European Court of Human Rights) or indirectly by allowing national courts to refer \ncases to a regional court. Such arrangements substantially reduce the cost of litigation in \ncomparison to pure inter-state disputes and thus should increase the expectation that a \nregional agreement will be enforced.  Yet, there are also larger sovereignty costs to such \ninstitutional arrangements. \n \n2.4  Implementation and Administrative Authority \n \nNon-compliance is not necessarily the result of willful acts by governments to act in ways \nthat are inconsistent with treaty commitments. Many issues of non-compliance arise due \nto the complexity of implementing agreements (see Chayes and Chayes 1993, Raustiala \nand Slaughter 2002). Implementing regional agreements generally requires delegating \ntasks to a bureaucracy or even an independent regulatory agency. Bureaucracies vary in \ntheir technical capacities to implement regional regulation. Moreover, agencies generally \n ", " \n6          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nhave some discretion and could potentially abuse this to implement their own policy \npreferences or extract rents.  \n \nAllowing  private  parties  to  challenge  administrative  decisions  in  front  of  impartial \ntribunals  could  limit  such  practices  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  administrative \nagencies  to  correctly  implement  regional  rules.  Such  fire  alarm  control  could  be \nexercised  by  domestic  administrative  tribunals.  Regional  tribunals  have  the  added \nbenefit of contributing to coordination of interpretation. This is important as common \nregulation only has the desired effect if it is interpreted in a common way. Moreover, \nregional  courts  may  have  better  expertise  to  interpret  international  law.  In  several \nregional  agreements,  most  notably  the  EU,  OHADA,  and  the  Andean  Community, \nnational courts then have the right or obligation to refer disputes over regional law to a \nregional court. As the empirical part of this paper will demonstrate, many of these \ndisputes are between private parties and regulatory agencies over the proper application \nof regional law in the denial of permits, trademarks, and so on. These regional courts \noften issue advisory rulings only about the interpretation of regional law in a case, \nleaving  the  actual  resolution  of  a  dispute  to  the  national  court.  This  limits  their \ninterference with domestic sovereignty. \n \nThere are two other ways in which regional courts contribute to checking administrative \nauthority. First, some regional integration projects, most notably the EU, create new \nsupranational bureaucracies with the authority to implement, interpret, and even issue \nlegally  binding  rules  and  rulings.  The  ECJ  often  reviews  disputes  between  the \nCommission and states or private parties about the proper exercise of that authority. \nSecond, the ECtHR has determined on various occasions that existing procedures for \nadministrative review in countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden were not truly \nindependent,  for  example  because  the  review  determinations  were  also  done  by \nadministrators rather than judges. Such rulings have led to important institutional reforms. \n \nThere is a large literature in economics that illustrates the positive economic effects of a \nproper system of checks and balances to the exercise of administrative authority (e.g. \nPersson and Tabellini 2003). Recent research in economic history suggests that the \nneed to check administrative power was the key to the development of the rule of law in \nmodern  Europe  (Gonz\u00e1lez  de  Lara  et  al,  2008,  Greif  2008).  Such  checking  of \nadministrative  authority  aids  in  the  harmonization  of  law  across  countries,  prevents \nabuses  of  authority,  and  helps  make  administrative  decisions  more  predictable  for \nbusinesses. All of these activities theoretically stimulate economic activity. Moreover, \nthey interfere less directly with sovereignty than the remedies targeted at willful non-\ncompliance by states. \n \n \n2.5  Credibility of Commitments \n \nRegional cooperation may be stifled by uncertainties about the degree to which actors \nare committed to the project. Regional agreements suffer from a time inconsistency \nproblem: even if it is in the interest of a government to comply with an agreement, the \nincentives for that government may change or the government may lose power. Since \nregional cooperation and especially integration often require costly ex ante investments \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       7 \nwith promises of long-term benefits, uncertainty about the commitment of actors could \nstifle a cooperation project.  \n \nDelegating  authority  to  an  independent  court  increases  the  credibility  of  these \ncommitments.  For  example,  new  democracies  may  want  to  signal  that  they  are \ncommitted to upholding human rights by signing a human rights treaty. They could \nincrease the credibility of that commitment by also delegating authority to interpret a \ntreaty  to  a  regional  court  and  allowing  citizens  to  directly  file  suit  with  that  court \n(Moravcsik  2000).  This  may  increase  the  perception  of  other  actors  that  these \ngovernments are committed to a regional integration effort and perhaps make actors \nmore likely to make long-term investments (Farber 2002). Governments also frequently \nuse judgments by international courts to explain to their domestic publics why they have \nto  maintain  an  unpopular  (protectionist)  policy  (Reinhardt  2002),  thus  potentially \nalleviating  fears  that  cooperation  will  stop  due  to  domestic  opposition.  Moreover, \ndelegation to regional courts may alleviate concerns among smaller states that they will \nbe subjected to power-based inequalities in the implementation of regional agreements. \nSuch assurances could be central to deepen cooperation among states.  \n \nThe credibility of a commitment to regional integration is only increased if the delegation \nto  the  regional  court  is  meaningful  in  the  sense  that  court  is  independent,  has \ncompulsory jurisdiction, is easily accessible for potential disputants, imposes meaningful \npenalties on non-compliance, and is costly to withdraw from. Indeed, the very logic of \nthis argument stipulates that there are benefits to incurring sovereignty costs.   \n \n \n3.  Are Asian States Less Likely To Resolve Disputes Through \nLegal Means? \n \nWhy have Asian countries, in contrast to governments elsewhere, seemingly rejected the \npotential benefits of regional courts discussed in the previous section? The answer to \nthis question is important for understanding the lessons that can plausibly be learned \nfrom experience elsewhere. Many accounts of why Asian countries prefer cooperation \nwithout legalization are based on the notion that Asian states share a strong preference \nfor non-binding commitments and non-legalistic methods of dispute resolution. This is \ngenerally considered a central feature of the \"ASEAN way\" as well as the \"Asia-Pacific \nway\" of cooperation (e.g. Acharya 1997). To some scholars this stems from a distinct \nlegal culture that is less adversarial and litigious than Western legal culture (e.g. Green \n1994). Instead, Asian approaches to dispute resolution stress consensus and informality. \nScholars have identified such differences in legal culture as one of the main challenges \nfor Asian states to participate in global legal regimes, such as the WTO (Peng 2000).  \nSome claim that the rise of Asian economies will significantly challenge the emerging \nglobal legal culture based on US legal practices and replace it with a culture based on \ninformal dispute resolution (Appelbaum 1997). Others argue that Asian countries differ \nnot  so  much  because  they  lack  an  adversarial  legal  culture  but  because  of  their \ndomestic political institutions and the sensitive nature of diplomatic relations between \n ", " \n8          |  Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nAsian states.7 Again others maintain that Asian governments\u2018 unusually strong concerns \nabout sovereignty costs lie at the root of their unwillingness to use legalized forms of \ndispute settlement (Poon 2001). \n \nThere is considerable criticism of the notion that there are cultural or institutional reasons \nthat underpin the cooperation without legalization route that Asian regionalism has taken. \nFor example, scholars have pointed to the diversity in Asia\u2018s domestic political and legal \ninstitutions  (Kahler  2000,  Pryles  2006).  Yet,  as  far  as  I  am  aware,  there  are  no \nsystematic tests in the literature of the proposition that Asian states are less likely than \nothers to resolve their disputes through legal means. Such a test is important for the \npurposes of this paper. If Asian countries have unusually strong predispositions against \nusing legal means to resolve disputes, then the lessons from other regions may not be \napplicable to the Asian context.  \n \nMy  empirical  strategy  for  evaluating  this  question  is  to  replicate  recently  published \nanalyses of legalized dispute resolutions in three critical areas: trade, investment, and \nterritory. I then add an indicator variable for whether a country is Asian, as defined by the \n8\nADB.   \n \n3.1  Trade Disputes \n \nIf Asian countries are averse to legalized dispute settlement, they may be less likely to \ninitiate trade disputes at the GATT/WTO than are other countries. In a study published in \nthe  Journal  of  Politics,  Davis  and  Bermeo  (2009)  analyze  why  some  developing \ncountries are more likely than others to initiate disputes at the GATT/WTO. They argue \nthat there are large start-up costs for using the dispute settlement process. Therefore, \nthey hypothesize that past experience as a complainant or defendant makes states more \nlikely to initiate disputes in the future. \n \nI replicated their analysis (without problems) and added an indicator variable for whether \na  country  is  Asian.  The  sample  includes  75  developing  countries  that  were  WTO \nmembers by 2003 (the end of the data), including 14 Asian countries. The analysis \nexcludes  31  least  developed  countries  who  are  beneficiaries  to  preferential  market \naccess and have less need to invoke WTO rights. Davis and Bermeo argue that the \ncorrelates that determine dispute initiation among developed countries are different and \nestimate a separate model for this group. The dependent variable is the number of cases \na country initiated in a given year. The model is estimated using a negative binomial \nregression, with robust standard errors clustered on countries. \n \nTable 1 offers the results of the simplest specifications estimated by Davis and Bermeo. \nThe indicator for Asia does not have an effect on either developing or developed country \ndispute initiation. This result also holds in the more extensive models with additional \ncontrol variables and a model where the dependent variable is converted to a binary \n                                            \n7  For example, Davis and Shirato (2007) use such an account to explain Japan\u2018s restraint in initiating \nWTO trade disputes. This also fits with the large literature that sees democracy as the key to \nexplaining trends in legalization (add citations). \n8  http://www.adb.org/Countries/ (accessed 30 June 2009). Japan is also included. \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       9 \nindicator, allowing for the use of a logit estimation. Finally, the result holds for developing \ncountries if the democracy variable is omitted from the regression model, indicating that \nit is not the scarcity of democracies in Asia that drives this result. \n \nIn all, there is no evidence that Asian countries are more averse to seeking legalized \nresolutions of their trade disputes. Of the 352 disputes initiated between the start of the \nWTO process in 1995 and October 2006, there have been nine within-Asia disputes \nbetween Singapore and Malaysia, Republic of Korea (Korea) and Japan (2), Japan and \nIndonesia (2), Korea and the Philippines, Bangladesh and India, Indonesia and Korea, \n9\nand Taipei,China and India.  This is more than the number of disputes filed among Latin \nAmerican, European, African, or Central American states. There are obviously different \nbase-line probabilities for the filing of such within region disputes, yet it is hard to \nmaintain based on these data that Asian states have a deep cultural aversion against \nlegalized resolutions of their trade disputes. \n \n3.2  Investment Disputes \n \nThe  regulation  of  foreign  investment  has  long  been  a  potent  source  for  disputes, \nespecially  when  foreign  property  is  expropriated  by  host  governments  of  foreign \ninvestments. In recent years, the regulation of foreign investment has increasingly taken \nthe form of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs), which may or may not delegate authority \nto an international authority to resolve disputes between foreign firms and governments \n(e.g.  Franck  2007).  The  most  prominent  international  body  that  resolves  the  vast \nmajority  of  investment  disputes  is  the  World  Bank\u2018s  International  Centre  for  the \nSettlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). ICSID rulings are public, are closely watched \nby investors, and are consequential for future FDI streams (Allee and Peinhardt 2009b). \nGovernments have much less control over ICSID dispute resolution mechanisms than if \nthey delegated dispute resolution to ad hoc arbitral tribunals or domestic courts (e.g. \nFranck 2007).  \n \nIf Asian countries indeed prefer cooperation without legalized dispute settlement, we \nwould expect these countries to be less willing to delegate authority to ICSID when they \nagree on cooperation by signing a BIT. Allee and Peinhardt (2009a) coded all publicly \narchived BITs for their level of delegation to ICSID. They create an ordinal variable, \ncoded 0 in the absence of any delegation, 1 if ICSID is one of the options for dispute \nresolutions and 2 if ICSID is the only venue for international arbitration. They argue that \nthis variable reflects the degree of delegation in an ordinal way because governments \nusually have some control over the venue of arbitration if ICSID is only one of more \noptions. The negotiation of BITs tends to be asymmetric in that there is usually one \n\u2017home\u2018 country (from which most of the investment originates) and a \u2017host\u2018 country \n(towards  which  the  investment  is  directed).  Home  countries  typically  (although  not \nalways) tend to prefer ICSID delegation but the preferences of host countries vary.  \n \n \n                                            \n9  Based  on  the  World  Bank\u2018s  WTO  data:  http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/ \nEXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:20804376~pagePK:64214825~piPK:64214943~theSitePK:469382,00.ht\nml (accessed 13 July 2009). \n ", " \n10          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nAllee  and  Peinhardt  identify  a  range  of  characteristics  of  host  countries  and  home \ncountries as well as of the relationship between them that would make it more or less \nlikely that a BIT includes an ICSID provision. I refer the interested reader to their article \nfor more details on the theoretical motivation for including these variables. The appendix \nlists the variables and precise data sources. I replicated their original results (without \nproblems) and added to their model indicator variables for whether there is an Asian \nhome or host country and an additional indicator variable for whether both countries are \nAsian.  \n \nTable 2 has the results from an ordinal probit model. Quite strikingly, an Asian home \ncountry makes it significantly more likely that a BIT delegates authority to ICSID. The \nsame is true for an Asian host country, although this effect is only significant at the 10% \nlevel in a two-tailed test. There is no additional effect of both countries being Asian. It is \nclear that Asian countries are not more likely to cooperate without legalized dispute \nresolution. If anything, the result seems to go the other way. \n \nIt is perhaps plausible that this reflects the specific Asian countries who sign BITs or that \nAsian  countries  are  less  likely  to  sign  BITs  because  they  expect  that  a  legalized \ncommitment will be involved. There is, as far as I can tell, no evidence in the BIT \nliterature of such a proposition. Moreover, coverage is broad. The data includes BITs \nwith 16 different Asian home governments and 29 different Asian host governments. 112 \n(11%)  of  the  BITs  have  home  countries  that  are Asian  and  251  (25%)  have  host \ncountries that are Asian. This includes 65 BITs involving People\u2018s Republic of China, \nwhich only include exclusive ICSID clauses in 9% of its BITs and had no ICSID option in \n59% of its treaties. In all, though, exclusive delegation to ICSID exists in 45% of BITs \nwith an Asian home country, 36% of BITs with an Asian host country, 42% of BITs \nbetween  two Asian  states  but  only  29%  of  the  total  population  of  BITs.  Moreover, \ncountries  that  are  threatening  to  leave  the  ICSID  system  appear  to  be  from  Latin \nAmerica,  not  Asia  (Franck  2009,  p.  436-7).These  data  simply  do  not  support  a \nconclusion that Asian countries that have signed BITs are particularly averse to legalized \n10\ndispute settlement (i.e. they do not prefer cooperation without legalization).  \n \n3.3  Territorial Disputes \n \nTerritory is another commodity over which states frequently bargain and even fight. Yet, \nterritorial disputes can also be settled through legal dispute resolution, for example \nthrough the International Court of Justice (ICJ) the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). \nA characteristic of such legal solutions is that both countries need to agree to it. If Asian \ncountries  are  averse  to  legalized  solutions,  then  territorial  disputes  involving Asian \ncountries should be less likely to be resolved by legal means than are other disputes. \n \nIn a study published in the American Political Science Review, Allee and Huth (2006) \ninvestigate what makes states more and less likely to choose legal dispute resolution \nover bilateral negotiations as a means for settling territorial disputes. They identify 1490 \nbilateral rounds of negotiations in 348 disputes over territory. They then code whether \n                                            \n10  Note that since companies rather than states tend to file ICSID suits, it is more useful to analyze the \ninitial decision to allow this to take place rather than the actual usage of ICSID. \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       11 \nthe negotiation round ended in a stalemate, compromise (bilateral concessions) or a \nlegalized form of dispute resolution. Their core theoretical contribution is the argument \nthat international legal rulings at least in some significant part provide political cover for \nleaders in need of making concessions. \n \nI refer the interested reader to the Allee and Huth article for more detail on model \nspecification.  The  appendix  provides  more  detail  on  measurement.  I  successfully \nreplicated their analyses (Table 2 in the article) and added two indicator variables: one \nfor whether the dispute involved an Asian country (true for 350 (23%) of rounds of \nnegotiations in the data) and one for whether both parties in the dispute were Asian (true \nfor 199 (13%) of cases).  The second variable is included to assess whether there is an \nadditional effect if both parties are Asian and thus, presumably, unlikely to resort to legal \nsolutions for their territorial disputes.  \n \nTable 3 shows that there is no significant effect of Asian involvement on the likelihood \nthat a dispute has a legal resolution. Thus, the involvement of Asian countries makes it \nneither more or less likely that a dispute is resolved through legal means. Creating \nexclusive category where one indicator variable measures whether only one Asian state \nis involved does not materially affect the result nor does dropping the indicator for \nwhether the conflict involves two Asian states. \n \nThe Allee and Huth data only runs until 1995. Since then, there have been at least two \nother Asian territorial disputes that were submitted to the ICJ: the dispute over Pedra \nBranca/Pulau  Batu  Puteh,  Middle  Rocks  and  South  Ledge  between  Malaysia  and \nSingapore and the dispute over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan between Indonesia \nand Malaysia. In all, there is no evidence that Asian countries are more reluctant than \nothers to seek legalized dispute settlement for their territorial conflicts. \n \n \n4.  Regional Resolution of Inter-State Disputes \n \nThe preceding section demonstrates that Asian states are not less likely to resolve inter-\nstate disputes through legal means in global institutions. Another plausible story is that \nAsian regional integration projects have a distinct social logic that warrants cooperation \nwithout legalization and that explicitly rejects European-style institutionalization. This is \nespecially reflected in the \"ASEAN way\" of regional cooperation. As Acharya (1997, \np.329) puts it:  \n \n[..]  the  \"ASEAN  way\"  is  not  so  much  about  the  substance  or  structure  of \nmultilateral  interactions,  but  a  claim  about  the  process  through  which  such \ninteractions are carried out. This approach involves a high degree of discreetness, \ninformality, pragmatism, expediency, consensus-building, and non-confrontational \nbargaining styles which are often contrasted with the adversarial posturing and \nlegalistic decision-making procedures in Western multilateral negotiations. \n \nThe  \"ASEAN  way\"  influenced  Asia-Pacific  regional  cooperation  and  has  also  been \ntermed the \"Asian way\" of regional cooperation (Acharya 1997). Indeed, there is no \ndocumented use of legalized regional mechanisms to settle disputes between states in \n ", " \n12          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nAsia.  This  section  evaluates  whether this  aversion  to the  use  of regional  legalized \nresolution of inter-state disputes is unusual. Inter-state disputes are those where one \nstate files dispute against each other and each state gets to present its case before a \ntribunal. As the summary below will show, while virtually all regional judicial institutions \nallow for such inter-state disputes (as does the ASEAN dispute settlement mechanism), \nthese provisions are rarely used.  \n \n4.1  Inter-State Disputes in Regional Tribunals \n \n11\nThere are four standing international courts  in Europe. The best known ones are the \nhighest courts of the European Union: the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the \nCourt of First Instance (CFI). Under Article 227, EU member states could directly bring \ncomplaints to the ECJ against other member states. The article has been used only a \nhandful of times and was described as \u2015a virtual dead letter\u2016 in a recent overview of ECJ \nactivity (Brunell et al 2008). The Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Agreement \n(EFTA) resolves disputes involving countries that are not part of the EU but that are part \n12\nof the European Free Trade Area.  The agreement that establishes the EFTA Court \n13\ngrants the Court jurisdiction to settle disputes between two or more member states.  Yet, \n14\nnone of its 102 pending or decided cases are inter-state disputes.  The BENELUX \nCourt  of  Justice  interprets  rules  of  law  common  to  Belgium,  the  Netherlands,  and \nLuxemburg. The BENELUX treaty established a College of Arbitrators to settle disputes \nbetween states but it has not appointed new arbitrators since the first nomination in 1962 \nand has never been used.15 Finally, the Council of Europe\u2018s European Court of Human \nRights (ECtHR) has issued over 10,000 judgments on individual complaints but only 3 \n16\ninter-state cases.  As of 2009, these courts have together allowed inter-state cases for \n172 years. Yet, it is difficult to find even 10 examples of such cases. In short, European \nstates have not settled their inter-state disputes by suing each other in regional courts.  \n \nIn addition, the Economic Court of the Commonwealth of Independent States (ECCIS) \nwas created in 1991 to resolve trade disputes among the countries belonging to the \n17\nCommonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS)  (Danilenko  1999).  Unlike  the  other \nEuropean courts, the legal status of ECCIS decisions is in dispute and the court has \n                                            \n11  Information comes from the Project on International Courts and Tribunals: http://www.pict-pcti.org \n(accessed 7 July 2009). \n12  Currently, these countries are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. \n13  Article 32, see http://www.eftacourt.int/index.php/court/mission/esa_court_agreement/ (accessed 6 July \n2009). \n14  http://www.eftacourt.int/index.php/cases (accessed 6 July 2009). \n15  http://www.pict-pcti.org/courts/beneluxCJ.html (accessed 7 July 2009). \n16  There were 17 inter-state complaints that were dealt with by the European Commission on Human \nRights.  Georgia  has  recently  brought  another  inter-state complaint  (against  Russia): \u2015Inter-State \nApplication Brought by Georgi Against the Russian Federation.\u2016 Press release by the Registrar of the \nEuropean  Court  of  Human  Rights,  27  March  2007.  http://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1111315  \n&Site=COE (accessed 9 July 2009). \n17  It only became a formal judicial organ of CIS in 1993 (Danilenko 1999). \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       13 \nweak enforcement capabilities, thus allowing losing states to ignore its rulings (Danilenko \n1999, Dragneva and De Kort 2007). During its first decade, the court issued 65 decisions, \n54 of which were advisory opinions and only 9 were disputes about non-performance of \neconomic obligations (Dragneva and De Kort 2007, p. 260). While little information is \navailable about these 9 cases, the perception is that they have been resolved through \nnegotiation (Dragneva and De Kort 2007, fn. 112). \n \nThe  evidence  from  Latin  America  is  similar.  The  Court  of  Justice  of  the  Andean \nCommunity (ATJ) is the third most active international court with 1492 rulings (Helfer and \nAlter  2009,  Helfer  et  al  2009).  About  90%  of  these  cases  came  from  preliminary \nreferences by national courts. Almost all of the other cases were initiated by a treaty \norgan  (the  Secretary-General). I  have  been  able  to find  only  three  pure  inter-state \n18\ncases.  Mercosur has had a formal arbitration system in place since 1991, which only \nallowed access to state parties. As of 2005, arbitration panels had issued only nine \nawards (Vervaele 2005). Institutional reforms to create more advanced forms of dispute \nresolution are under way.  \n \nThe Central American Court of Justice (CACJ) was originally established in 1907 to \nmaintain peace and resolve disagreements between Central American States. It was \ndissolved in 1918. Three of the court\u2018s ten decisions were inter-state cases.19 Since its \nrestart in 1990, the court has issued an additional 78 rulings (Alter 2009) but it is unclear \nhow  many  are  inter-state  disputes.  The  Caribbean  Court  of  Justice  (CCJ)  was \n20\nestablished in 2001  by the members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to \nreplace  the  Judicial  Committee  of  the  Privy  Council  and  to  interpret  the  Treaty \nEstablishing the Caribbean Community. The court has issued 34 judgments, none of \n21\nwhich were inter-state disputes.  \n \nNAFTA does not have a standing court but does allow for ad hoc binational review \npanels, most notable those under chapter 19. This has led to concerns about strategic \nforum shopping with the WTO (Busch 2007) and to critiques that the NAFTA panels \n22\nsupersede  conventional  judicial  review.  The  chapter  19  procedure  allows  private \nparties  to  sue  administrative  agencies  for  their  decisions  on  antidumping  or \ncountervailing duties. On at least 23 cases, government lawyers argued on behalf of \nthese private parties, creating a perception of putting two state actors into conflict with \n                                            \n18  Article  24  of  the  Treaty  Creating  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  Cartagena  Agreement \n(http://www.comunidadandina.org/ingles/normativa/ande_trie2.htm)  allows  states  to  file  non-\ncompliance claims with the secretary-general. The ATJ web-site suggests that it has happened on only \nthree  occasions  that  a  state  was  the  originator  of  a  non-compliance  complaint \n(http://idatd.eclac.cl/controversias/can.htm?perform=estadisticas&numero=5).  Yet,  when  reading \ncases it becomes clear that several of the cases brought by the secretary-general originated with state \ncomplaints (private communication with Karen Alter and Larry Helfer, 7 July 2009). \n19  http://www.worldcourts.com/cacj/eng/decisions.htm (accessed 10 July 2009). \n20  The court was inaugurated in 2005. \n21  http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/judgments.html (accessed 10 July 2009). \n22  Adam Liptak \u2015Nafta Tribunals Stir U.S. Worries\u2016 The New York Times Sunday 18 April 2004. \n ", " \n14          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n23\neach other.  NAFTA does not have a treaty organ in charge of enforcement nor is it part \nof a deeper regional integration project.  \n \nAfrica has four active international courts: Common Court Of Justice And Arbitration Of \nThe Organization For The Harmonization Of Corporate Law In Africa (OHADA, or OHBLA), \nthe Court Of Justice Of The Common Market For Eastern And Southern Africa (COMESA), \nCourt of Justice of the East African Community (EACJ), and the Court of Justice of the \nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). OHADA aims to harmonize \ncorporate law in 16 mostly francophone African states. Its Common Court of Justice and \nArbitration  had  issued  274  judgments  by  2007  (Alter  2009),  none  were  inter-state \n24\ncases.  COMESA established a common market between 19 states in Eastern and \nSouthern Africa. Its court was established in 1994 and its first judges were appointed by \n25\n1998.  The Court had heard seven cases by 2007 (Alter 2009), none of which appear to \n26\nbe inter-state cases.  The EACJ and its predecessor have issued eight rulings, none of \n27\nwhich appear to have been inter-state cases.  The ECOWAS court has received 33 \n28\ncases, none inter-state disputes.  \n \nThere are also a number of courts that have been in existence for some time but that \nhave never or rarely been used (Alter 2009). These include the Organization of Arab \nPetroleum Exporting Countries Tribunal (OAPEC) (1978), The West African Economic \nand Monetary Union Court (WAEMU) (1995) , the Community of Central Africa Court of \nJustice  (CEMAC)  (2000),  and  the  Tribunal  of  the  Southern  African  Development \n29\nCommunity (SADC) (2007).  Thus, the ASEAN dispute resolution mechanisms is not \nthe only existing DSM that has not been used.  \n \n4.2  Why So Little Use of Regional Mechanisms for Inter-State Disputes? \n \nIn all, the number of standing regional courts is about equal to the total number of direct \ninter-state disputes that they have resolved. Why are there so few inter-state disputes \nsubmitted to regional courts? Part of the answer is that some regional agreements have \ntreaty bodies, such as the European Commission, that can file infringement suits against \n                                            \n23  Based on a reading of disputes at: http://www.sice.oas.org/DISPUTE/nafdispe.asp (accessed 7 July \n2009). In addition there were 25 disputes filed by private business where I did not find evidence of \ngovernment  involvement  on  both  sides.  Chapter  11  also  gives  private  actors  standing  to  sue \ngovernments for damages, a procedure that has been widely used. There has also been one inter-\nstate dispute under Chapter 20. \n24  http://www.ohada.com/jurisprudence.php (accessed 13 July 2009). \n25  http://about.comesa.int/lang-en/institutions/court-of-justice (accessed 13 July 2009). \n26  I  was  able  to  find  evidence  of  only  five  cases:  http://www.aictctia.org/courts_subreg/comesa/                                        \ncomesa_cases.html (accessed 13 July 2009). \n27  Alter 2009 and http://www.aict-ctia.org/courts_subreg/eac/eac_home.html (accessed 13 July 2009). \n28  http://www.aict-ctia.org/courts_subreg/ecowas/ecowas_home.html (accessed 13 July 2009). \n29  Moreover, there are a number of courts that are not yet operational, including the Court of Justice for \nthe Arab Magreb Union (AMU), the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of Central African \nStates (ECCAS), and the African Court of Justice (ACJ). \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       15 \nstates and that can, to some extent, serve as substitutes for inter-state disputes. It is \nlikely that some complaints about foreign practices originate with other governments, \nalthough there is no hard evidence that documents this. Politically, there is a difference \nbetween cases between a commission and a government and cases where two states \ninvolved in a broader regional integration project directly challenge each other in court. \nAmong others, it would force the court to chose sides between two member states, \nwhich could cause some fallout for a regional integration project. Moreover, especially \nthe literature on the EU shows that the Commission often takes its own initiatives and is \nquite far from a simple tool that (powerful) member states can use to go after each other \n(e.g. Pollack 1997). Finally, DSMs in regions that lack a supranational body are also not \nfrequently  used,  suggesting  that  there  is  something  else  going  on  than  a  simple \nsubstitute story. \n \nThe  theory  section  already  highlighted  that  economic  disputes  between  states  are \nusually proxy disputes.  Businesses are harmed or benefit from unfair trade practices. \nStates are only hurt indirectly. There are many hurdles that may prevent states from filing \nsuits  against  each  other.  Businesses  must  lobby  governments  to  file  suits  on  their \nbehalves and pay the cost for this. This generally only works if they come from a \nparticularly influential or economically important sector. In such cases, it may be more \nuseful to file at a global institution, such as the WTO, where the precedent will be \nbroader. There are many other ways to resolve disputes between states and many \nissues that could be linked together in omnibus compromises. The patterns in the data \nalso  suggest  that  there  are  additional  political  cost  to  be  paid  from  using  regional \ninstitutions for inter-state disputes. For example, the only regional tribunal that is used \nsomewhat frequently to resolve (proxy) inter-state disputes are the NAFTA binational \nreview panels, which exist in the absence of a broader political regional integration \nproject. At times, the existence of a regional inter-state DSM may be a useful option, if \nonly as a potential outcome that all want to avoid. But there is little reason to believe that \nresolving  inter-state  disputes  has  been  a  major  contribution  of  regional  judicial \ninstitutions or that it will be in the Asian context. \n \n \n5.  What Can Be Learned from the Activity of Regional Judicial \nInstitutions? \n \nThe widespread perception that Asian states are unusual in their reluctance to resolve \ntheir disputes through legal means is at least partially based on misconceptions about \nthe behavior of Asian states and about the logic of regional integration elsewhere. Asian \nstates are not generally less likely than are other states to resolve their disputes through \nlegal means. Moreover, regional integration in other parts of the world has not been \ndriven by legal institutions that resolve inter-state disputes. Indeed, European, Latin \nAmerican, and African states also do not sue each other in regional courts and prefer to \nresolve their differences through other means.  \n \nThese findings are important because they establish that there is some potential for \nlearning from the experience of regional judicial institutions elsewhere. But what are \nthese potential lessons that could be valuable for Asian regional cooperation projects? I \n ", " \n16          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nreview the evidence by answering the questions suggested in the theory section. What \ndisputes do they resolve? What is their interpretive authority? How does the exercise of \ntheir dispute resolution and interpretive activities influence compliance, commitment, and \nchecks and balances?  I then apply these lessons to the design of a potential new Asian \njudicial institution. \n \n5.1  The Activities of Courts: Dispute Resolution and Interpretation \n \nMost disputes in front of regional judicial institutions are of two kinds. First, there are \ndisputes between a treaty body, such as the European Commission, and a government, \nfor example about whether a government has correctly implemented a treaty provision. \nSuch cases constitute about one-fourth of the ECJ\u2018s caseload and less than 10% of the \nATJ  caseload  (Alter  2009).  Second,  and  much  more  commonly,  regional  judicial \ninstitutions review disputes between private actors and a government or a government \nagency. These may be cases where a private party charges that a government has \nincorrectly  implemented  regional  law.  More  commonly,  these  are  cases  where  the \nrelevant law for a dispute over an administrative decision is regional rather than national \nlaw. \n \nThe activity of courts is not a simple function of formal institutional design. Allowing \nprivate actors access does not by itself ensure that a court becomes active (see also \nAlter 2006) nor does granting a treaty body the authority to file infringement suits against \ngovernments mean that they will actually do so (see Helfer and Alter 2009 for the \nAndean Community). For private access to matter, two criteria need to be satisfied. First \nand most obvious, there must be legally binding regional rules that create rights and \nobligations for private parties. This allows private parties to sue and be sued on the basis \nof regional law. A second condition is that if private access is indirect, as it is for virtually \nall cases other than the European Court of Human Rights, there must be national \ninstitutions that perceive to have an interest in referring cases to the regional court. \nSome regional agreements require national courts to refer cases to a regional court if the \nissue concerns regional law but, as the examples below will illustrate, this does not \nmean that this actually happens. In the case of the ECJ, it was crucially important that \nnational courts started to see the ECJ as an ally that could help them advance their \ninterests as opposed to an institution that encroached on their terrain (see Alter 1998, \nWeiler 1994). This is not (yet) the case for national courts in most OHADA member \nstates (Dickerson 2005). In the case of the ATJ, the key national actors were national \nadministrative agencies charged with protecting intellectual property rights (IP) that were \nthe engines behind increased references to the regional court (Helfer and Alter 2009).  \n \nThe ATJ illustrates these points well. Until recent research by Larry Helfer, Karen Alter \nand  Florencia  Guerzovich,  little  was  known  about  the  world\u2018s  third  most  active \ninternational court (Helfer et al. 2009, Helfer and Alter 2009). The ATJ had only a minimal \ncaseload in the 1980s and early 1990s. Yet, references to the court started to increase in \n1995 due to two factors. First, the Andean Community adopted IP rules that were \nbroadly consistent with the TRIPS rules under WTO. These rules gave private actors \nrights and obligations under Andean law. At the same time, domestic administrative IP \nagencies were transformed or created. These agencies were in charge of reviewing \ntrademark and patent registrations. Since the relevant IP law was regional law, they \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       17 \napplied  this  law  in  those  decisions.  Consequentially,  when  dissatisfied  businesses \nchallenged these administrative decisions in courts, Andean law had to be interpreted by \nnational courts. Initially most national courts were hesitant to refer such cases to the ATJ. \nYet, through various forms of pressure by IP agencies, businesses, and lawyers, courts \n30\nin three countries (Columbia, Ecuador, and Peru) started to refer IP cases to the ATJ.  \nSuch cases make up about 90% of the nearly 1500 judgments the ATJ has issued.  \n \nAnother interesting example of a regional regime that delegated authority in a limited \nissue area to a regional court is OHADA. OHADA (Organization for Harmonization in \nAfrica of Business Laws) is a system of business laws and implementing institutions \n31\nadopted  by  sixteen  mostly  francophone  West  and  Central  African  nations.  These \ncountries adopted this regime in 1993 in order to stimulate (foreign) investments and \npromote  growth  (Mancuso  2006).  The  organization\u2018s  Council  of  Ministers  has  the \nauthority to adopt uniform acts that need not be implemented by national legislatures. \nMany of the acts are based on draft conventions and model laws created by other \norganizations, such as UNIDROIT, but they are adjusted to reflect Western Africa\u2018s \nrealities. The Cour Commune de Justice et d\u2018Arbitrage  (CCJA) is an international court \nthat ensures that OHADA laws are interpreted uniformly across the membership and to \nincrease the credibility of the regional regime. Formally, the CCJA provides a forum for \ninterstate arbitration as well as a court of last resort for disputes under OHADA law that \nwere initiated within member states. Predictably, the first function remains undeveloped \n(Dickinson 2005). The second function has led to at least 274 judgments, most coming \nfrom C\u00f4te d\u2018Ivoire (the seat of the court), indicating that in reality national courts do not \n32\nalways refer OHADA cases to the CCJA.  Nevertheless, the regime is broadly perceived \nto be a remarkable success (Mancuso 2006). \n \n5.2  Broader Effects of Regional Judicial Institutions \n \nThe theory section stipulated that by exercising their immediate functions of dispute \nresolution and treaty interpretation, regional judicial institutions could also have broader \neffects on regional cooperation. Most notably, they can help improve compliance with \nregional agreements, increase the commitment that states have to regional integration, \nand provide checks and balances to new international authority.  \n \nThere is regrettably little evidence that regional judicial institutions have or have not had \nsuch  broad  effects. While  there  is  considerable  evidence  that  national  courts  have \nmostly been willing to accept ECJ rulings in individual cases (e.g. Weiler 1994), it is \nunclear what broader effect the court has had on compliance in the EU.  It is clear that \ncompliance  in  the  EU  is  far  from  perfect.  For  example,  Mastenbroek  (2003) \n                                            \n30  See Helfer and Alter 2009 for the more precise story on the mechanisms in each country and also for a \npreliminary account of why the same trend has not happened in Bolivia and Venezuela. \n31  The Western African members are: Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2018Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, \nNiger,  Senegal,  and  Togo.  The  Central  African  members  are  Central  African  Republic,  Chad, \nCameroon, Comores, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. \n32  Alter 2009. Private parties may also not always insist on this, given the expense of proceedings in a \nanother country (Dickerson 2005). There are hundreds more rulings on OHADA law that are decided in \nnational courts. \n ", " \n18          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \ndemonstrates that even in the Netherlands, a country widely praised for its compliance \nwith international law, only 40 percent of EU directives are implemented on time. More \ngenerally, research about compliance with EU law and the ECJ\u2018s role in this is fraught \nwith data and methodological differences (e.g. B\u00f6rzel 2001, Tallberg 2002). To make \nmatters worse, Carrubba et al. (2008) find evidence that the ECJ may take anticipated \ncompliance into account in its decision making process. To my knowledge, there are no \nsystematic studies of compliance with the ECtHR or other regional courts. \n \nThe effect on commitment can only be gleaned anecdotally. While there are many \nexamples of failed regional integration projects (see Mattli 1999), I am not aware of a \nregional integration scheme that collapsed after it has had an active regional court. The \npossible exception is the Central American Court of Justice, which issued ten decisions \nbetween 1908 and 1916. Cases of countries withdrawing from the jurisdiction of an \nactive regional court are also few and far between. The withdrawal of Trinidad and \nTobago from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights over the issue \nof the death penalty is the most prominent example that comes to mind (Helfer 2002). \nYet, it is impossible to assert what the causal role of regional courts is in keeping a \nregional integration project going. \n \nThere is anecdotal evidence that regional courts have had commitment benefits, in \nunanticipated ways that may be attractive for Asian states. For example, Helfer et al. \n2009  document  how  the  distinct  Andean  interpretation  of  IP  law,  which  had  been \ninfluenced by national IP agencies, strengthened the Peruvian negotiation position in \nbilateral bargaining with the United States as it allowed the Peruvian delegation to \ncredibly claim that they could not make certain concessions given that those would be in \nviolation of Andean law. Given that Andean law cannot be changed by Peru unilaterally, \nthis commitment device may work rather well. In this sense, then, opting for a regional \nlegal regime may be a way of implementing legal obligations in a manner that stays \ncloser to home than it would be in the absence of such a regime.  \n \nThe effect on checks and balances is clearer, albeit almost entirely build on qualitative \nevidence (e.g. Weiler 1994, Mattli and Slaughter 1998). A recent interesting exercise in \nchecks and balances came in the ECJ\u2018s recent Kadi decision33, which invalidated the \nEU\u2018s  implementation  of  a  Security  Council  resolution  that  requires  the  financial \nmeasures against persons linked to a terrorist organization, as determined by a UN \nSanctions  Committee.    The  Kadi  decision  essentially  argues  that  persons  had  no \neffective legal remedy to challenge their placement on the list and thus the freezing of \ntheir  bank  accounts.  This  is  a  remarkable  example  in  checking  the  exercise  of \ninternational authority over individuals. \n \nMore generally, it has proven difficult to examine empirically to what extent regional \njudicial institutions have indeed increased transnational economic activity. Kono (2008) \nfinds that the presence of inter-state DSMs appears to stimulate regional trade but that \nthere is no evidence that enhancing the legalistic features of this process have had any \neffect. Stone Sweet and Brunell (1998) find evidence that ECJ activity is both driven by \n                                            \n33  Joined Cases C-402/05 P and C-415/05 P. \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       19 \nand drives transnational economic activity. There are no studies that I know of that show \nthat OHADA has or has not increased (foreign) investment or whether the Andean IP \nregime has improved innovation. One piece of evidence cited by OHADA scholars is that \nadditional  states  are  eager  to  join  the  organization  (Mancuso  2007).  The  same  is \nobviously true for the EU but less so for the Andean Pact. \n \n5.3  Institutional Implications for Asia \n \nWhat do these lessons mean for a potential judicial institution that could help stimulate \ntransnational economic activity in Asia? It would be unwise to transplant one of the \nexisting  regional  judicial  institutions  to  Asia.  Outright  copying  of  formal  institutional \nstructure is common but rarely successful (Alter 2009). Yet, there are some lessons that \ncould be learned. The most obvious negative one is that an institution that focuses solely \non resolving inter-state disputes is unlikely to contribute much. There are few downsides \nto having a formal inter-state dispute settlement mechanism, such as ASEAN\u2018s, but it is \nnot clear that such a mechanism will have significant effects either. A second negative \nconclusion is that given the present institutional structure, it would be unwise to create a \ncourt that primarily aims to reduce deliberate non-compliance by member states. Such \ncourts  can  only  function  effectively  in  the  presence  of  a  strong  supranational \nbureaucracy that can file infringement suits. \n \nThe most straightforward answer to the question why there are no active standing Asian \ncourts is that there are few if any regional rules that create rights and obligations for \nprivate parties. To some extent this is answering a question by positing a different one: \nwhy are such rules absent? I suggest two answers. First, heterogeneity within Asia is \ngreater than in other regions. This is true even within the most developed sub-regional \ninstitution: ASEAN. This diversity makes it difficult to coordinate on regulations that are \nappropriate across a region or sub-region. Second, many Asian states have traditionally \nbeen characterized as \u2015developmental states,\u2016 which seek to exercise social and political \ncontrol  over  business  through  informal  means  rather  than  through  independent \nregulatory agencies that are delegated the authority to apply a well-defined body of \nformal law (e.g. Woo-Cumings 1999).  Recently, scholars have argued that several Asian \ncountries are moving towards a regulatory state model (e.g. Ginsburg and Chen 2008, \nJayasurya 2007, Pearson 2005). This trend is at least partially a response to economic \ninterdependence and membership in international regimes (Ginsburg and Chen 2008), \nas it was in Europe (Majone 1994). Such reforms create a demand for administrative \nreview as both governments and private actors become increasingly concerned that \nagencies are unable to implement the new rules well or even that they might abuse their \nauthority.   \n \nAlthough regional law plays a limited role in Asian administrative review, a regional court \ncould aid national courts and administrative agencies in areas where global international \nlegal obligations are already important. Asian countries are party to various multilateral \ntreaties that create obligations vis-\u00e0-vis private parties. Although there are no regional \nrules  on  government  procurement,  several  Asian  states  are  part  of  the  WTO's \nGovernment Procurement Agreement (Hsu 2006). The WTO\u2018s intellectual property rights \nregime (TRIPS) also has important implications for regulatory regimes. Moreover, many \nAsian  states  are  actively  seeking  to  bring  their  business  law  in  accordance  with \n ", " \n20          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \n34\ninternational standards. All major Asian economies are members of UNIDROIT  and \nmany are signatories to its conventions that seek to unify private law. Several Asian \nstates are members of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HccH) and \n35\nare parties to its various conventions.  Asian states are also active in UNCITRAL, the \nUN body that seeks to harmonize and modernize international business law through \nconventions and model laws. \n \nThere is some evidence that  Asian countries have increased such commitments in \nrecent years. For example after long remaining outside the regime, South Korea (2005) \nand Japan (2009) are the latest major trading powers to join the 1980 UN Convention on \nContracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG),36 leaving Brazil, India, the United \nKingdom, and South Africa as the only major trading countries that have not signed what \nis  arguably  the  most  successful  international  contract  treaty.  Another  example  was \ndiscussed earlier in this paper: the frequency with which Asian countries are willing to \ndelegate authority to ICSID to arbitrate in investment disputes between private parties \nand the government. \n \nIn short, several Asian states appear increasingly willing to make international legal \ncommitments  that  create  obligations  vis-\u00e0-vis  private  parties.  Moreover,  they  have \nrecognized that harmonization of commercial law is desirable. Even if this has not led to \nnew regional law, a regional judicial institution could improve the uniform implementation \nof those existing international legal commitments, improve the perceived commitments \nby  Asian  states  to  those  legal  rules,  and  create  further  momentum  towards \nharmonization. The suggestion is to create a judicial institution that can, at the request of \nnational courts or administrative agencies, offer advisory opinions on the interpretation of \ninternational rules, laws, and standards that are already applicable. The assumption is \nthat  governments  want  to  see  those  obligations  implemented  but  that  national \nadministrative agencies or courts may not always be well-equipped to do so. While a \ncomplete proposal for a new judicial institution is beyond the scope of this working paper, \nI want to offer some thoughts and suggestions as to what such an institution could look \nlike and could reasonably seek to accomplish. \n \n\uf0b7  The new institution would issue advisory opinions on a well-defined set of treaties \nand  conventions  that  countries  have  already  ratified.37 It  would  leave  the \nresolution  of  disputes  to  the  national  courts.  This  is  appropriate  as  actual \ndisputes often involve a mixture of domestic and international legal issues that \ncan be better assessed by local courts. This may also alleviate some sovereignty \nconcerns. It would specifically not be within the mandate of this institution to \ninterpret domestic law or make judgments as to whether domestic law contradicts \n                                            \n34  http://www.unidroit.org/english/members/main.htm. \n35  http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=states.listing.  \n36  They  were  the  only  major  countries  that  signed  in  this  period:  http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/ \nen/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1980CISG_status.html. \n37  The determination of the set of treaties and conventions that are relevant here should be determined \nby legal experts. States should then be able to choose among that list. \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       21 \ninternational legal obligations. Such determinations are left to the national review \nprocess. \n\uf0b7  The judicial institution would be composed of experts of international commercial \nand business law. It could be hosted by the Asian Development Bank as part of \nits technical assistance mission. Indeed, the ADB already supports business law \nreform through this program.38 A first step could be the creation of a working \ngroup of legal experts to investigate the sensibility of and demand for such an \ninstitution  or  other  ways  the  ADB  could  help  promote  the  harmonization  of \nbusiness law.  \n\uf0b7  I suggest an optional protocol that if ratified would give any party to a dispute in \nthat country the right to refer a question about the appropriate interpretation of \ninternational law to the new judicial institution. It might make sense to limit this to \ndisputes  before  appellate  courts.  Ratifying  such  a  protocol  would  signal  a \ncommitment to uniform application of international obligations. I propose that \ngovernments that have not signed the optional protocol may still request advisory \nopinions in certain circumstances (perhaps on a pay-per-use basis). Such usage \nwould obviously not send the same commitment but could well contribute to \nuniform interpretation. \n\uf0b7  Since many of the laws that this institution would interpret are global in nature, it \nmay seem odd to design a regional institution to interpret them. First, other \nregions already have judicial institutions that, among others, interpret the laws \nunder discussion here. Given this, they would have little impetus in partaking. \nSecond, international legal obligations are interpreted in a context. For example, \nCISG obligations have been interpreted differently in countries with different legal \ncultures and developmental status (Ryan 1996). Although Asia is a large and \nextremely diverse continent, the world is bigger and even more diverse. There is \na demand for Asian cooperation that is at least partially driven by the perception \nthat there are a set of common development challenges. Moreover, given high \nlevels of intra-Asian trade, the benefits of uniform interpretation within Asia might \nencourage more Asian states to sign on to the various conventions that are \nalready open for signature. Third, the institution may serve as a model or impetus \nfor future innovation. It does not create new legal obligations but it could create a \nframework  for  future  Asian  conventions  towards  harmonizing  business  laws. \nFourth, by not integrating the institution into one of the existing regional initiatives, \nit provides a model for harmonization that recognizes the enormous diversity \namong Asian states. Each state could sign on at its own pace and based on the \nconventions it has ratified. The model provides incentives towards harmonization \nbut creates no obligations. \n\uf0b7  The  idea  is  not  to  create  another  institution  for  international  commercial \narbitration. There are two important limits to arbitration. First, as noted in the \ntheory section, arbitral tribunals have limited capacity to clarify the meaning of \n                                            \n38  See for example \u2015Technical Assistance Solomon Islands: Supporting Business Law Reform\u2016 Project \nNumber: 38151: http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/SOL/38151-SOL-TAR.pdf. \n ", " \n22          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nlegal obligations and thus do not contribute to their uniform interpretation. Indeed, \nit is plausible that the new institution could contribute to the uniform interpretation \nof the law by arbitral tribunals, which is a big issue in the arbitration literature (i.e. \narbitral tribunals tend  to  be  inconsistent  in  their  interpretation  of  legal  rules, \ncontributing to uncertainty).  For example, CISG is regularly interpreted in courts \nand  arbitral  tribunals39 but  their  interpretations  have  diverged  considerably; \nlimiting the treaty\u2018s intended unifying effects (Ryan 1996). Second, international \ncommercial arbitration is usually accessible only to large foreign investors; often \nonly investors from certain countries. This regime is therefore frequently criticized \nfor creating different rights for different investors. While large foreign investors \nare important, economic development is driven as well by smaller investors and \ndomestic actors.  \n\uf0b7  The  judicial  institution  operates  on  the  assumption  that  governments  are \ninterested in assuring that their international legal obligations are implemented \nand  interpreted  in  a  uniform  way  across  the  region.  Domestic  courts  and \nregulatory agencies are already regularly asked to interpret international rules, \nstandards  and  regulations.  They  may  be  ill-equipped  to  do  so.  The  judicial \ninstitution seeks to rectify this problem. The institution is not based on the naive \nassumption that deliberate non-compliance is not a problem but does assume \nthat progress can be made by improving implementation and coordination in \nareas where governments do want to comply.  \n \n \n6.  Conclusion \n \nEffective regional judicial institutions perform two core tasks that can stimulate economic \nactivity: they resolve disputes in efficient and impartial ways and they coordinate the \ninterpretation of laws and treaties. In so doing, they could also have broader effects on \nregional  cooperation  such  as  improving  incentives  for  compliance,  increasing  the \nperceived commitment of parties to a regional integration project, and contributing to the \nimplementation of agreements. The analyses in this paper demonstrate that Asian states \nhave not foregone these theoretical advantages because they are inherently adverse to \nlegalized dispute resolution. Moreover, their reluctance to resolve inter-state disputes \nthrough regional judicial institutions is shared by states in other regions. \n \nThe examples of the Andean Community and OHADA illustrate that it is possible to use \na  regional  court  to  help  harmonize  narrow  areas  of  law  relevant  for  transnational \n40\neconomic activity without creating a powerful supranational bureaucracy.  Moreover, \nthese examples demonstrate that national institutions still play a major role in the extent \nto which such a regional court becomes active in a country, perhaps alleviating some \nconcerns about sovereignty costs and that Asian states are too diverse to effectively \nharmonize laws. These courts mostly review decisions by administrative agencies that \n                                            \n39  For a database, see: http://www.unilex.info/.  \n40  Some international bureaucracy is required but such a bureaucracy need not have the power to issue \nbinding directives, as in the case of the European Commission. \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       23 \naffect private actors. National courts may lack the expertise to review such administrative \ndecisions and/or the law may be regional in character, as is the case with intellectual \nproperty rights law, which operates in the shadow of the WTO regime. Unlike with the \nresolution of inter-state disputes, there is no particular reason why a regional court of this \ntype would interfere with political or consensual forms of dispute resolution between \nstates. Yet, the theoretical benefits of harmonizing (and presumably improving the quality \nof) areas of corporate law could be substantial.  \n \nNeither the ATJ nor the CCJA are exemplary in their functioning. Indeed, the conditions \nfor an effective regional court of this type may well be better in Asia, although there are \nalso some obstacles. For example, OHADA was greatly helped by the fact that virtually \nall of its member states had similar laws on the book that were inherited from the French. \nAsian countries are more diverse in this regard. As such, the most suitable candidates \nmay be areas of law where international obligations already play a major role, such as \nintellectual property rights and investment law.  There may also be political advantages \nto developing a distinct Asian jurisprudence in such areas given that these issues are \nbound  to  emerge  in  future  rounds  of  WTO  negotiations  or  in  bilateral  trade  and \ninvestment treaty negotiations. The institutional innovation suggested in this paper seeks \nto improve the way existing legal obligations are implemented throughout Asia, thereby \ncontributing to a greater uniformity and predictability in the laws under which businesses \nthat engage in transnational economic activity operate.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \n24          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nTable 1: Trade Dispute Initiation  \n \nVariable  Developing Countries  Developed Countries \nAsia  .38 (.39)  -.16 (.37) \nPrevious Initiations  .09 (.03)***  -.01 (.00)** \nDemocracy  .19 (.09)**  .50 (.22)** \nLog GDP  1.00 (.24)***  1.67 (.60)*** \nLog Population  -.48 (-.22)**  -.99 (.59)* \nEnglish  -.31 (.32)  1.31 (.41)*** \nWTO Period  -.08 (.26)  .58 (.16)*** \nConstant  -18.80 (3.22)  -29.04 (6.55) \nDispersion parameter  .74 (.17)  .32 (.08) \nN  1314  543 \n \n         *p<.10, **p<.05, ***p<.01 (two-tailed).  \n \n         Source: Davis and Bermeo 2009, Tables 2 and 3. \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nRegional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?  |       25 \nTable 2: Ordered Probit Results for Delegation to Delegate Dispute \nSettlement to ICSID  \n \nVariable  Coefficient (Robust S.E.) \nAsian Home Country  .48 (.17)*** \nAsian Host Country  .18 (.10)* \nBoth Asian Countries  -.18 ( .29) \n   \nPresence of MNCs in Home   1.83 (.72)*** \nStrength of Legal Institutions in Home   .13 (.04)*** \nStrength of Legal Institutions in Host   .03 (.04) \nDurability of Host Regime  -.00 ( .00) \nPolitical Constraints on Executive in Host   .38 (.19)* \nAlliance Ties   -.05 (.08) \nColonial Ties   -.12 (.12) \nHost Recently Independent   -.28 (.10) \nDomestic Economic Growth Host  -.00 ( .00) \nExport Dependence Host   .00 (.00)** \nReliance on External Financial Assistance Host   .77 (.39)** \nRight Wing Government Host  .02 (.08) \nRatio of Home to Host Economic Power  .66 (.16)*** \n \nN = 1032 Bilateral Investment Treaties, *p<.10, **p<.05, ***p<.01 (two-tailed).Wald \u03c72 test (16df) = 97.12 (.00)  \n \n          Source: Allee and Peinhardt, Table 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \n26          | Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 65 \nTable 3: Multinomial Logit Results for the Outcomes of Rounds of Talks \nover Disputed Territory  \n \n  Legal Dispute Settlement   Legal Dispute Settlement  \nvs. Bilateral Concessions  vs. Stalemate \nAsian involvement  -.27 (1.06)  -.55 (1.05) \nBoth countries Asian  .22 (1.24)  .40 (1.22) \nStrong domestic political opposition  1.36 (.48)***  .95 (.47)*** \nDemocratic dyad (accountability)  1.35 (.60)***  1.29 (.58)*** \nEthnic ties with territory  .92 (.41)***  .89 (.46)** \nEnduring rivals  1.54 (.70)***  1.20 (.67)* \nHard-line stance in previous negotiations  .02 (.20)  -.47 (.19)*** \nDemocratic dyad (norms)  -.70 (.65)  -.31 (61) \nMilitary asymmetry  -3.64 (1.48)***  -4.60 (1.46)*** \nCommon security ties  .60 (.43)  .62 (.42) \nStrategic value of territory  -.64 (.58)  -.75 (.57) \nConstant  -3.02 (.51)***  -3.36 (.50)*** \n \nNote: N = 1490.

What \nlessons from elsewhere could be valuable to Asian regional economic integration? This paper\nshows that Asian states are not unusually averse to refer inter-state disputes to global\n judicial institutions. Moreover, Asian states are not unique in their reluctance to resolve \nregional inter-state disputes through judicial means. The most valuable lesson for Asia from \nexperiences elsewhere is the role that regional courts can play in resolving disputes between \nadministrative agencies and private parties about the implementation of international law.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on \nless than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No.  Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20100929174841Z", "Subject": "Regional Economic Integration", "Author": "Erik Voeten", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Keywords": "regional judicial institutions, regional economic integration, Asia", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "ModDate": "D:20101208151124+08'00'", "Title": "Regional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?"}}
