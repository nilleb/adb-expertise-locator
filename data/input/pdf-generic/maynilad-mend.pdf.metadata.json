Christina Due\u00f1as\n\nMai Flor\n\n\f\fIn January 2007, the new and all-Filipino \n\npartnership of DM Consunji  Holdings \nIncorporated and Metro Pacific \n Investments Corporation (DMCI-MPIC) \n\ntook over the reins of Maynilad Water \nServices, Inc., Metro Manila\u2019s beleaguered \nwater concession. They replaced the almost \n decade-long partnership of Maynilad\u2019s \nprevious shareholders\u2014Benpres Holdings \nCorporation, Suez Environment, Lyon-\nnaise Asia Water Pte Ltd, and Metrobank.                      \nExactly 1 year later, the new Maynilad  \nhas paid off its remaining foreign debts of \nabout $240 million, allowing them to exit \nMaynilad\u2019s rehabilitation phase way ahead \nof its 2013 deadline. In addition, the newly  \nrevitalized company has embarked on a  \n33 billion Philippine Peso (P) capital   \nexpenditure program for 2007\u20132015,  \nwith P8 billion eamarked for 2008 alone.\n\n Services, Inc. (Maynilad). A 25-year conces-\nsion  agreement governed the turnover.\n\nMWCI was awarded the rights to operate \n\nthe waterworks and sewerage services in \nMetro Manila\u2019s East Zone, home to then \n4 million people and comprising eight \ncities and municipalities.2 Maynilad was \nawarded the West Zone, home to then 7.3 \nmillion people and comprising 17 cities and \nmunicipalities3 (Figure 1).\n\nBefore the concession began, MWSS \nwas weighed down by two major problems. \nFirst, it was deeply indebted to foreign \ncreditors\u2014the debts were estimated at almost \n$900 million in 1997\u2014and badly needed \nmore financing. Second, its operations were \ncharacterized by myriad inefficiencies. \nMWSS was then providing water to just over \n60% of Metro Manila\u2019s residents, and not \neven half of them had 24-hour water supply. \n\nThe road to Maynilad\u2019s \n\nrecovery is long, with the \noutcome still uncertain. \nBut the entrance of a new \nplayer into the fray gave the \nstruggling concession a new \nshot at success. \n\nConcession at a Glance\n\nMaynilad\u2019s entrance into the \npicture was watched by the \nglobal water community. In \nAugust 1997, in a bold move \nhailed as the biggest water \nprivatization effort at the time, \nthe state-owned Metropolitan \nWaterworks and Sewerage \nSystem (MWSS)1   handed \nover its operations to two \nprivate concessionaires: the \nManila Water Company, Inc. \n(MWCI) and Maynilad Water \n\nFigure 1: Metro Manila Water Supply System Concession Service Area\n\n1  Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) has jurisdiction over all waterworks and sewerage systems in a service area \n\ncomprising the National Capital Region, the entire province of Rizal, and part of the province of Cavite.\n\n2  East Zone comprises the cities of Makati, Pasig, Mandaluyong, most parts of Quezon City, some parts of Manila, and the municipalities \n\nof San Juan, Taguig, and Pateros.\n\n3  Maynilad\u2019s area of coverage includes Valenzuela, Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, parts of Quezon City, Manila, Pasay, a part of Makati, \n\nLas Pi\u00f1as, Para\u00f1aque, Muntinlupa, Cavite City; and Cavite municipalities of Rosario, Imus, Noveleta, Bacoor, and Kawit.\n\n1\n\n\fLess than 9% were connected to a sewerage \nsystem and water losses were staggering at \n63%. The utility also had 8,000 employees\u2014 \ntoo many as this translates to 9 staff handling \na single household connection. \n\nThe concession agreement between \nMWSS and the two concessionaires called \nfor the latter to provide 24-hour water \nsupply that meets water quality standards \nand maintains certain pressure levels (16 \npounds per square inch [psi]). It also binds \nthe concessionaires to the following service \nconnection targets:\n\nTable 1: Service connection targets \n(% of service population)\n\n \nIndicators\n \n\nEast Zone \n\nWest Zone\n\n1997 \n\nTarget \n\n1997 \n\nTarget\n\nWater Supply \nSewerage \n\n63.0 \n13.0 \n\n94.6 \n55.0 \n\n65.0 \n7.0 \n\n98.4\n66.0\n\nSource: Concession Agreement between MWSS and Maynilad, \n1997.\n\nIn addition to these targets, the \n\nconcessionaires also had to service MWSS\u2019s \nforeign debt through annual payments of \nconcession fees and the posting of a $120 \nmillion performance bond. Given that \nthe West Zone had the more developed \ninfrastructure and larger customer base \nand, therefore, was assumed to require \nless capital infusion, Maynilad was made \nresponsible for paying back 90% of MWSS\u2019s \ndebts (approximately $800 million). MWCI \nshouldered the remaining 10%. As it \n\nThe unserved wait in line to get \nwater from public tap stands\n\nturned out, this skewed division of foreign \ndebt service responsibilities was a major \ncontributor to Maynilad\u2019s downfall.\n\nThe concession agreement also created \n\nthe MWSS-Regulatory Office (MWSS-RO), \nwhich regulates the performance of both \nconcessionaires and conducts tariff rate \ndeterminations. \n\nAs for tariff rates, the agreement also \n\nprovided for the following\n\n\u2022  yearly adjustment based on inflation \n\n(consumer price index adjustment or      \nC factor);\n\n\u2022  price adjustment covering extraordinary \nevents (extraordinary price adjustment or \nE factor); and\n\n\u2022  rate rebasing exercise 5 years upon the \n\nstart of the concession, the  commencement \ndate to be set by MWSS-RO, and every     \n5 years thereafter (R factor).\n\nApplications for tariff adjustments are \nsubmitted to MWSS-RO, which only has \nrecommendatory powers. The power to \napprove any tariff adjustment rests on the \nMWSS Board of Directors.\n\nReturning the Concession\n\nSerious financial difficulties attacked \n Maynilad almost from day one. The 1997 \nAsian financial crisis, which saw the peso \ndepreciate against the United States (US) \ndollar by more than 100% by the end of \n\n2\n\n\f1998,4  severely affected its ability to  service \nMWSS\u2019 debts and pursue much-needed \ncapital expenditures. Topping this are other \nfactors that further  crippled the  company\u2019s \noperations\u2014from critical  regulatory issues  \nto the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon in 1997\u20131998 \nthat reduced the metropolis\u2019 water suply to \nby at least 40%, to alleged financial mis-\nmanagement, e.g., unnecessarily expensive \nprocurement deals.\n\n In the first 2 years of operations, \nMaynilad\u2019s concession fee payments were \nhigher than the generated revenues. By \nend-2000, Maynilad\u2019s revenues rose just \nenough to equal roughly the concession \nfee payments, but still nothing was left for \noperational and capital expenditures (see \nTable 2). \n\nTable 2: Key financial figures for Maynilad (P million)\n\n Indicators \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000\n\nConcession \n   fee paid\nRevenue \n\n866 \n\n2,265 \n\n1,978 \n\n2,082\n\n751 \n\n1,662 \n\n2,379 \n\n2,634\n\nSource: Thierry Krieg, Powerpoint Presentation at the   \nMulti- stakeholders Dialogue on Water Services for the Poor,  \n31 May 2002.\n\nIn an effort to recover from foreign \nexchange (forex) losses, Maynilad petitioned \nfor tariff increases and was granted an \nextraordinary price adjustment in 2000. \nHowever, this increase was not enough \nto cope with the concessionaire\u2019s losses. \nMaynilad again filed a petition to allow for \nmore flexible currency rate adjustments, \ngiven that the existing provision in the \nconcession agreement only covers normal \nfluctuations (within 2%). MWSS rejected the \npetition, saying that this can be construed as \nchanging the bid. On 8 March 2001, due to \nheavy financial losses, Maynilad was forced \nto suspend its concession fees payment on \ngrounds of \u201cforce majeure.\u201d \n\nMaynilad and MWSS went back to the \nnegotiating table to resolve the conflict and, \non 5 October 2001, agreed on amendment \n\nno. 1 to the concession agreement. \n\nAmendment no. 1 offered many \npromises, but fell short on delivery. In a \nnutshell, the amendment\n\n\u2022  recognized the gravity of the forex \n\nproblem and allowed for the recovery of \npast forex losses through staggered tariff \nincreases (within 18 months);\n\n\u2022  allowed for tariff rate adjustments based \non prevailing exchange rates for the \n remainder of the concession, referred \nto as the foreign currency differential \nadjustment (FCDA); \n\n\u2022  allowed for the implementation of the \n\nfirst rate rebasing exercise on 1 January \n2003; and\n\n\u2022  called upon MWSS to address the \n concerns of Maynilad\u2019s lenders\u2014 \nprimarily those of a regulatory nature\u2014\nto enable the concessionaire to close a \n$350 million loan application crucial to \nits operations. \n\nDespite efforts by both parties, \n\namendment no. 1 was not fully implemented \nand Maynilad failed to secure the much \nneeded $350 million loan. \n\nMany factors affected the loan \n\nnegotiation. Involved foreign and local banks  \nwanted assurances that the tariffs will be \nincreased as necessary, regardless of the \npolitical upheavals taking place at the \ntime.5 They also wanted to ensure that the \nGovernment will not sequester Maynilad\u2019s \nassets in times of war or emergency. \nUnfortunately, no such assurances were \nforthcoming. But the bigger barrier was the \nissue of contract termination, which was \na major concern then given Maynilad\u2019s \nprecarious financial position. Ultimately, \nMaynilad, MWSS, and the lenders could \nnot agree on the terms and conditions \nfor termination (e.g., qualifications and \nprocedures for the appointment of a \nreplacement operator, early termination \namount, etc.).\n\n4  From P26=$1 at the time of the bidding in January 1997, the peso devaluated to P50 to $1 by 1998 and continued to increase in the \n\n5  2001 was the year of the EDSA II revolution that ousted then President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, who was succeeded by then  \n\nsucceeding years.\n\nVice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\n3\n\n\fBy end-2002, a nearly bankrupt \n\nMaynilad announced that it was returning the \nconcession back to MWSS, issuing a notice \nof early termination on 2 December.\n\nSurviving the Legal Battles\n\nMWSS questioned Maynilad\u2019s move, saying \nthat only they have the right to terminate the \nconcession due to nonpayment of concession \nfees. Maynilad claimed the same right by \nvirtue of force majeure.\n\nSince the concession agreement provides \n\nthat all disagreements and claims between \nthe parties in relation to the agreement must \nbe resolved by arbitration,6 the matter went \nbefore the appeals panel for major disputes. \n\nThe appeals panel had three members, \n\nwith MWSS-RO and the concessionaire \nappointing a member each. The president \nof the Paris-based International Chamber \nof Commerce designated the third and \nindependent member, who acted as \nchairperson of the panel.\n\nNine months of closed deliberations and \n\nroughly $3 million later, the panel\u2019s much-\nawaited decision came on 5 November 2003. \nIt was not, however, the panacea that both \nMaynilad and MWSS sought. The panel \ndecided that neither party was entitled to \nterminate the concession agreement, leaving \nthem in exactly the same position they \nwere in prior to arbitration. To compound \nMaynilad\u2019s troubles, the panel ordered it to \npay the outstanding concession fees, which \nhad already ballooned to P6.77 billion ($120 \nmillion) since 2001. If Maynilad fails to \npay, the panel granted MWSS the authority \nto draw on the company\u2019s $120 million \nperformance bond. As can be expected, the \npanel\u2019s decision drew the ire of privatization \nwatchdogs who felt that it should not have \ntaken a long and complex arbitration process \nto compel Maynilad to do something that is, \nin the first place, already explicitly stated in \nthe concession agreement.\n\nOn 13 November 2003, Maynilad \n\nsought court protection from its creditors by \nfiling a petition for corporate rehabilitation. \nMaynilad won a minor victory as the \nRehabilitation Court appointed a receiver, \nissued an order staying all claims against \nMaynilad, prohibited the company from \ndisposing its properties, and disallowed the \ndrawing against the performance bond for a \nfew months.\n\nHowever, MWSS countered this before \nthe Supreme Court and won the right to draw \non the performance bond. This prompted \nMaynilad\u2019s other lenders to pressure the \ncompany to pay its outstanding loans. \nAs Maynilad failed to pay, all the lenders \ncalled on the sponsors\u2019 guarantees. Benpres \nHoldings Company, which owned 59% of \nMaynilad\u2019s shares, defaulted. \n\nForced to negotiate a way forward, all \nparties began discussions on restructuring \nMaynilad\u2019s debts. On 28 April 2005\u20142 \nyears down the line\u2014MWSS, Maynilad, \nits shareholders, and creditors entered \ninto a debt and capital restructuring \nagreement (DCRA) that spelled out \nthe steps for restructuring Maynilad\u2019s \nfinancial obligations. The provisions of the \nDCRA were incorporated in Maynilad\u2019s \nrehabilitation plan, which was approved \nby the Rehabilitation Court on June 2005. \nDCRA gave MWSS the option to subscribe \nto 83.97% of Maynilad\u2019s equity, paving the \nway for the entry of new private shareholders \ninto the company.\n\nLosing Big to Win: Maynilad\u2019s \nDebt and Capital Restructuring\n\nThe customers of Metro Manila\u2019s West \nZone have to be served, with or without \nMaynilad\u2019s financial woes. Working from \nthat premise, the Government explored \nall possible avenues to straighten out \nMaynilad\u2019s finances. This included MWSS \nlending money to Maynilad\u2014in the form \nof deferred concession fee payments\u2014to \nfund the latter\u2019s operations and some capital \n\n6  Arbitration should be in accordance with the rules of the United Nation Commission on International Trade Law.\n\n4\n\n\fimprovements while its owners are  entering \ninto a debt restructuring arrangement \nwith the creditors. MWSS also agreed to \na  deferred and staggered payment of past \ndue concession fees in excess of the $120 \nmillion performance bond, a  postponement \nof the sewerage targets that would entail \nmassive investments, and to buy into \napproximately 84% of Maynilad\u2019s equity, on \nthe understanding that the equity will later be \noffered to the private sector. \n\nAll the other stakeholders joined the \nrace to find workable long-term solutions for \nMaynilad\u2019s chaotic finances. The sponsors \nagreed on substantial write-offs, the lenders \nagreed to deferred payments with much \nreduced interest rates, and the contractors \nand suppliers agreed to deferred payments \nover 2 years.\n\nBar none, all stakeholders agreed to \nlose big\u2014whether on par value of shares, \n\nBar none, all stakeholders agreed to \n\nlose big to ensure that Maynilad\u2019s \n\nfinances are rehabilitated and its \n\nobligations paid. \n\nforegone interest earnings, or debts written \noff\u2014to ensure that Maynilad\u2019s finances are \nrehabilitated and its obligations paid. \n\nThe rehabilitation of Maynilad\u2019s finances \n\nhinged on debt and capital restructuring.\n\nRestRuctuRing  Maynilad\u2019s debts\nAt the time of the restructuring in 2005, \nthe balance of Maynilad\u2019s payable debts \namounted to roughly $488 million, payable \nto four categories of creditors: MWSS, Suez \nGroup, lenders (banks),7 and other creditors \n(contractors and suppliers).

The remaining \ncapital stock\u2014except for a portion held by \n\nLAWL\u2014were then surrendered to Maynilad \nand retired. This, in effect, meant that \nBenpres wrote off its entire equity of P3.09 \nbillion and about $11.2 million in shareholder \nadvances,11 while Suez wrote off almost all its \nP2.1 billion equity in Maynilad. This wiped \nout Maynilad\u2019s remaining capital deficit.12 \nSimultaneous with decreasing the \nvalue of its stocks, Maynilad increased its \nvolume to P1.475 billion\u201913 worth, with the \nstocks still priced at P1 per share. MWSS \nthen subscribed to a total of P1.238 billion \n($22.7 million) of these stocks, roughly 84%, \nthrough a debt-to-equity conversion. LAWL, \non the other hand, converted $5.1 million14 \nfor its 16% share.\n\nSoon after these were completed, \n\nMWSS proposed to conduct an international \ncompetitive tender for the right to subscribe \nto the 84% Maynilad shares currently in its \npossession. \n\nMaynilad employees enjoying piped water \nin one of their project sites\n\n11  The exit of Benpres from Maynilad also allowed its release from its guarantees for the bridge loan, SBLC facility, and loans of $118.1 \n\nmillion and P1.4 billion.\n\n12  Maynilad\u2019s capital deficit after the par value reduction was P41.4 million.\n13  $27 million based on an assumed exchange rate of P54.63 to $1.00.\n14  Lyonnaise Asia Water, Ltd shares were bought for a premium, as the 16% was equivalent to only $4.32 million.\n\n7\n\n\fFinding New Sponsors: \nThe MWSS Competitive Tender\n\nKey players in the sector knew\u2014or thought \nthey knew\u2014that auctioning off MWSS\u2019s \n84% stake in Maynilad was going to be a \ntough sell. After all, the company was still \nin dire straits, with customers  unwilling to \ntrust its services and its 540-square  kilometer \narea having seen little service  improvements \nwhile the negotiations for the turnover \n continued. Moreover, there was a  general \ndistrust in the Government\u2019s ability to \n manage the rebidding process with integrity, \nseeing that the Government has received \nmore than its fair share of corruption and \nrigging charges. Finally, the capital infusion \nneeded to put Maynilad on the right track \nis quite steep\u2014an estimated P3 billion\u20134 \nbillion  between 2007 and 2013 and a capital \n spending requirement of $12 million for a \n3-month period.\n\nFortunately, reality made mincemeat of \n\nthese fears. \n\nMaynilad, through a competitive \n\nselection, appointed ABN-AMRO15 as \nfinancial advisor to MWSS. ABN-AMRO \nhelped MWSS design the bid terms, which \nhad two main parts. \n\nPart 1 covers the minimum condition for \nbidders. This sets the minimum bid at $56.7 \nmillion, comprising the \n\n\u2022  value of the actual 84% equity of the \n\ncompany at P1 per share ($22.7 million) \nplus $3 million interest; and\n\n\u2022  $31 million financial assistance that \n\nMWSS previously provided Maynilad in \nthe form of deferred concession fees and \narbitration costs granted by the appeals \npanel.\n\nPart 2 involves the amount of additional \n\nresources that bidders can put in the \ncompany. This includes \n\n\u2022  a financial supplement of $2.5 million, \n\nwhich represents MWSS arbitration costs \n\nto be remitted in cash; and \n\n\u2022  additional resources to fund capital \nexpenditure and/or prepayment of \nMaynilad\u2019s outstanding obligations.                   \nThe winning bidder will assume               \nMaynilad\u2019s obligations under                                                                       \nthe DCRA. \n\nA two-envelope system was used for the \n\ntender\u2014one for the technical and business \nbid and another for the financial bid. The \nfirst stage of the evaluation was scrutinizing \nthe technical and business bid on a pass-or-\nfail basis. The bidder\u2019s financial offer will \nonly be opened if its technical and business \nqualifications pass scrutiny. \n\nMWSS formed a technical committee \nto evaluate the bids and hired the Halcrow \nGroup16 to help evaluate the technical plans. \nThe technical committee also set these \nminimum qualifications for bidders\n\n\u2022  a competent operator of water supply \nand/or sewerage services owns at \nleast 15% of the equity interest in the \nconsortium or;\n\n\u2022  collectively, the bidder and at least \n\none member with at least 20% of the \nequity interest in the consortium has \ndemonstrable experience and satisfactory \ntrack record in at least one of the \nfollowing areas\n\u2013 water supply and sewerage services,\n\u2013 telecommunications,\n\u2013 power distribution, and\n\u2013 construction.\n\nOf course, given Maynilad\u2019s need for \n\ncapital, the bidder\u2019s financial capacity \nwas considered primary. As such, steep \nrequirements were imposed to weed out \nprospective bidders who have no real \nfinancial capability to improve Maynilad\u2019s \nservices. These requirements included\n\n\u2022  a minimum of P6 billion ($120 million) \ncapitalization in Maynilad, backed \nup by an irrevocable standby letter of \n\n15  ABN-AMRO is a holding company with subsidiaries that perform commercial banking operations, investment banking, and other \n\n16  Halcrow Group is a multidisciplinary consultancy specializing in planning, design, and management services for infrastructure \n\nfinancial activities.\n\ndevelopment.\n\n8\n\n\f\u2022  the consortium of DMCI-MPIC,\n\u2022  IL & FS,\n\u2022  MWCI,\n\u2022  Marubeni Corporation, and\n\u2022  Rubia Holdings-Noonday Asset \n\n Management Asia, Pte.\n\nOf these five, only three firms submitted \n\ntheir technical and financial bids: MWCI, \nDMCI-MPIC, and Rubia Holdings-Noonday \nconsortium. The Indian financial firm IL & \nFS expressed concerns over the 16% shares \nowned by Suez18 and did not submit its \nproposals.\n\nOf the three, the Rubia Holdings-\nNoonday consortium was disqualified after \nit failed to submit the standby letter of \ncredit for $2.5 million. The submissions of \nRubia were returned unopened, and the firm \nconceded its disqualification.\n\nMWCI and DMCI-MPIC passed the \nscrutiny of MWSS\u2019 technical committee. \nThe battle, therefore, came down to the \ndollar bottomline. On 8 December 2006, \nthe financial bids of both companies were \nopened.\n\ncredit issued by a bank17 of the highest \nstanding, and \n\n\u2022  a bid guarantee of $2.5 million in the \n\nform of a standby letter of credit in favor \nof MWSS to ensure that the winning \nbidder will assume all the obligations of \nMWSS, including entering into contracts \nand other legal documents to implement \nthe necessary transactions. \n\nWhen the bid was first announced in \nAugust 2005, 11 investor groups expressed \ninterest and procured the bid documents. \nThese were\n\n\u2022  Amroc Investments Asia, Ltd.; \n\u2022  DMCI Holdings, Inc., a Philippine \n\ninfrastructure company that also owns \na majority stake in the joint venture \ncompany, Subic Water and Sewerage \nCompany, Inc.;\n\na firm of Philippine lawyers;\n\n\u2022  Gil Valera and Associates, a firm of \n\nPhilippine accountants;\n\n\u2022  Infrastructure Leasing and Financial \nServices, Ltd.

Suez has since sold its shares.\n\n.\n\n9\n\n\fThe minimum bid required was \n\n$56.7million. The MWSS special bids and \nawards committee was anticipating bids of \nno more than $100 million, especially given \nthat the company\u2019s existing debt load is still \nover $200 million. The final result could not \nbe more surprising or encouraging. \n\nWith a total bid of $503.9 million, the \nconsortium of DMCI-MPIC eased MWCI \nout of the competition and emerged as the \nnew owners of Maynilad. Its bid comprised \nthe minimum bid and a financial supplement \nof $447.2 million. MWCI\u2019s financial \nsupplement was almost $50 million less, at \nabout $400 million.19\n\nDMCI Holdings present Isidro Consuji \nreceives congratulations after the bids \nwere flashed on stage\n\nMaynila\u2019s New Lease on Life\n\nSo where has the successful rebidding           \nprocess landed Maynilad? \n\nSimply put, the rebidding exercise just \n\nchanged a single but crucial aspect of the \nMaynilad setup\u2014the operator. This means \nthe original concession agreement remains \nin operation, and the new owners will be \nmeasured against the long list of performance \nand service coverage targets that governed \nBenpres and its co-shareholders.\n\n19  The exact figure is $399,999,999.99.\n\n10\n\nAmendment no. 1, approved in \nOctober 2001, is the sole modification to \nthe concession agreement. Its provisions \ncontinue to be crucial since they address \nthe one glaring weakness of the concession \nagreement\u2014the forex fluctuations and how \nthey impact the peso income and debts in \nhard currencies. However, the new owners \nwill begin their stint with one important \ntarget adjustment\u2014under the DCRA, MWSS \nagreed to suspend the sewerage targets \ntemporarily, which understandably requires \nhuge investments.\n\nThe new owners are undaunted by  \n\ntheir new challenge despite having only  \n15 years to fulfill the terms of the concession \nagreement, improve and expand Maynilad\u2019s \nservices, and turn their investments into \nprofit. The fact that they bring to Maynilad \na wealth of experience both in and out \nof the water sector could account for this \nconfidence.\n\nDMCI is a leading construction company \n\nand real estate developer in the Philippines. \nIt has considerable experience in the water \nsector, being the majority owner of the \nSubic Water and Sewerage Company, Inc. \n(SubicWater) since 1996. SubicWater is the \njoint venture company that serves as primary \nwater, sanitation, and sewerage provider for \nthe Subic Bay Freeport, a special economic \nzone northeast of Metro Manila.\n\nMPIC, on the other hand, is a major \nplayer in the telecommunications, shipping, \nand real estate industries in the country. \nAmong its strengths is its substantial \nexperience in rehabilitating ailing public \nutilities. MPIC Chairman Manuel Pangilinan \nwas largely responsible for turning the \ncountry\u2019s problematic Philippine Long \nDistance Telephone Company into the \nefficient and profitable company that it is \ntoday. \n\nMaynilad\u2019s new owners recognize the \n\nneed to turn the company\u2019s performance \naround in the shortest time possible. Their first \norder of business is, therefore, a quick exit \nfrom the 2005 Rehabilitation Plan and DCRA.\n\n\fFinancial bids of the two bidders flashed on stage\u2014\nDMCI-MPIC\u2019s on the left and MWCI\u2019s on the right\n\nUnder the DCRA, all creditors \n\nwould have to be paid first before serious \ninvestments in infrastructure and service \nexpansion can be made, with the schedule \nof payments extending to 2013. In addition, \nMaynilad can only apply for rate rebasing \nto recover their investments once they have \nexited the rehabilitation phase. Remaining \nin this phase, therefore, curtails Maynilad\u2019s \nability to expand and optimize its operations. \nIn August 2007, DMCI-MPIC signed \n\na prepayment and settlement agreement \nwith Maynilad\u2019s creditors and MWSS. \nBy December of the same year, the \nRehabilitation Court approved Maynilad\u2019s \npetition to get out of corporate rehabilitation, \nlifting the restrictions imposed by the \nDCRA. A month later, helped by the peso\u2019s \nsubstantial appreciation against the dollar,20 \nthe company paid off all its remaining debts, \nnow pegged at roughly $240 million\u2014$199 \nmillion for Maynilad\u2019s debts to banks and the \nrest for its obligations to nonbank suppliers.\n\nThe next order of business is to \n\nimplement its aggressive, two-stage recovery \nplan designed to bring in revenues and bring \ndown commercial losses. \n\nThe first stage of the recovery plan \n\ninvolves a system-wide water audit, \n\nimproving water supply and pressure \nmanagement, enhancing reservoir \nmanagement and pump station efficiencies, \nand upgrading the system\u2019s software and \ninformation technology facilities. The \nsecond stage focuses on the replacement \nof old water mains, conducting extensive \npost-rehabilitation network maintenance, \nand improving overall service repairs and \nconnections. \n\nMaynilad plans to invest P33 billion \nin capital expenditures up to 2015, with \nP5 billion for 2007 and another P8 billion \nearmarked for 2008. These are far higher \nthan was ever poured into Maynilad by \nBenpres and its partners, which attained its \nhighest point at P1.5 billion a year. As can \nbe expected, a lot of new construction and \nrehabilitation measures are ongoing in Metro \nManila\u2019s West Zone.\n\nBut concurrent with the physical \n\ndevelopments are the soft-side \ninterventions. One major thrust of the new \nMaynilad is making its customers happy.                              \nThis means retooling its human resources \nand management style to increase Maynilad\u2019s \nservice orientation. It also means stepping \nup the capacity development of its human \nresources\u2014from establishing new incentive \n\n20  The average conversion rate in January 2008 was $1= P40.9 (National Statistical Coordination Board).\n\n11\n\n\fprograms for employees to introducing a \ncadetship program to attract younger people \nto improving the commercial and marketing \nabilities, image, and efficiency of the \nemployees.\n\nIn the coming years, the new Maynilad \n\nmanagement has vowed to work on its \nvision\u2014transforming Maynilad from a mere \nwater supply company to one with a strong \nadvocacy for sustainable water management.\n\nTriumph of the Rebidding Process\n\nWhether Maynilad will attain this vision and \nits performance targets remain to be seen. \nWhat is certain at this point is that the 5-year \nnegotiation process with lenders for the \nexecution of the DCRA and the rebidding of \nMaynilad has  contributed significantly to the \n concessionaire\u2019s new lease on life.\n\nABN-AMRO, financial advisers of \nMWSS for the rebidding process, said that \nthe Maynilad deal has created a template \nfor future privatization initiatives in the \nPhilippines. But what, exactly, is this new \ntemplate?\n\nupholding integRity \nTo say the least, the 2 years that it took to \nfind new owners for Maynilad was grueling, \nbut at its heart is the integrity that all key \nplayers strove to uphold.\n\nTo ensure credibility and transparency \n\nin the bid process, MWSS engaged ABN-\nAMRO and Halcrow to act as advisors for \nthe tender. This resulted in a straightforward \nbidding procedure that did not allow for \nbureaucratic haggling and maneuverings and \na comprehensive terms of reference (TOR) \nthat served to filter nonserious bidders. \nThe TOR\u2019s requirement for an irrevocable \nstandby letter of credit in the amount equal to \nP6 billion for the winning bidder, along with \nthe $2.5 million bid bond, deterred those \nwithout the right financial capacity from \nparticipating in the bid. \n\nThroughout the entire selection \nprocess, MWSS and its advisers also held \ndialogues with the owners, creditors, and \n\nWe are not just a water \ncompany. We are partners of \nthe West Zone communities in \nworking for their well-being \nand progress, and we protect \nand nurture the environment \nwhich provides the resources \nthat is our lifeblood, ensuring \nsustainability of this precious \nresource from source to \ndischarge.\n\nRogelio L. Singson, President, Maynilad\n\nOngoing construction at Barangay Binakayan, Cavite\n\n12\n\n\fother stakeholders to understand their \nissues. In addition, MWSS issued regular \nupdates to keep all stakeholders abreast of \ndevelopments.\n\nWhen the bidding finally ended, the \nlosing party congratulated the winner and \nthe special bids and awards committee for \nthe professionalism and transparency of the \nprocess.\n\ngoing local\nInternational water operators that usually \nparticipated in similar tenders over the past \nyears were conspicuously absent in this \nprocedure. In fact, none of the large water \ncompanies from Europe, United States, \nand even Asia showed any interest in \n participating in the bid. \n\nThis confirms recent trends in the water \n\nsector, which show international water \ncompanies shying away from \n\n\u2022  high-risk areas, particularly those where \nthey perceive regulatory regimes to be \nnot very mature; and \n\n\u2022  deals that require massive investments.\n\nLearning from the lessons of Latin \n\nAmerica, Jakarta, and Manila, these \n\ncompanies restrict their participation \nto build-operate-transfer (BOT) or \nmanagement-type contracts that limit their \nfinancial exposure to manageable levels and \ndo not carry regulatory risks.                                                                                                                          \nThe fact that the winning bidder is  \n\n100% Filipino-owned, as opposed to the \nother bidders that had foreign partners, also \ngives the Maynilad deal a new spin. Both \nDMCI-MPIC and MWSS hope that with \nFilipinos partnering with Filipinos, the \nmanagement conflicts21 experienced by the \nprevious owners will not be present this time \naround.\n\nseRvice and Revenue potentials \nDMCI-MPIC said that with water being \na critical and essential public service, the \npotential for creating long-term value\u2014\neither in sustainable water management or \ncustomer satisfaction\u2014and generating profits \nis vast. Judging by the large number of \ninterested partners in the early stages of the \nbidding process\u2014many of them investment \nfunds\u2014DMCI-MPIC is not alone in this \nbelief. \n\nThis certainty that providing water \nsupply and sewerage services is a viable and \n\nInauguration of the mainline extension \nat BASECO Compound, Manila\n\n21  According to Suez, the partnership with Benpres had troublesome dynamics from the beginning. Benpres quickly asserted its \n\nmanagement role and limited Suez\u2019s role to technical advisory, with the advisors not sufficiently integrated into the management \nstructure (Source: World Bank and Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility. 2007.

With the winning bid being five \ntimes more than the expected, this was not \nsurprising at all.\n\nForging new partnership \nwith the community\n\nFormer Maynilad president Fiorello \nEstuar said the bids reflect the true value \nof Maynilad. In 2004, the company\u2019s value \nwas practically zero. After the bid, just 84% \nof Maynilad is already worth half a billion \ndollars.\n\nIn separate discussions with both DMCI-\nMPIC and MWCI, the bidders revealed that \ntheir aggressive bids are based on their belief \nthat the return on investment would be good. \nThe most obvious area for improvement \nis, of course, reducing nonrevenue water \n(NRW) as this directly impacts revenues. \nAt the time of the bid, the NRW level was \nat 70%, higher than its 1997 rate when the \nconcession started. Both bidders\u2019 confidence \nin their ability to reduce NRW is attested to \nby their respective experiences. \n\nForging Ahead\n\nWhen Maynilad\u2019s original shareholders \npulled out of the company, naysayers \npredicted the decline of private sector \nparticipation in the Philippine water sector. \nThe successful rebidding process showed \nthem that Maynilad\u2019s past problem-filled \ndecade has produced valuable lessons that \nfoster, not deter, private sector involvement.\n\nIn particular, the experience identified \n\nthe critical factors for engaging private \ninvestors in the water sector\u2014good \ninformation, competent regulators, \ninnovative risk management strategies, \nflexible provisions for forex fluctuations,  \nand a government ready and willing to \nuphold the principles of private sector \nparticipation.\n\nNow that the rebidding process is over \nand Maynilad has successfully entered its \nsecond decade, it is important to remember \nthat all parties\u2014MWSS, former sponsors of \nMaynilad, and creditors\u2014worked together \ntoward the successful rebidding to ensure \nthat services to the West Zone will continue \nand improve over the remaining period of the \nconcession.\n\nThe whole exercise shows that if the \nprocess is done right, investors are ready to \nbet even on an ailing water utility. n\n\n14\n\n\fON THE MEND\n\nPhotos: Maynilad Water Services, Inc.
