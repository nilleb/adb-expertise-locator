However, long-term official assistance\nwill become increasingly scarce, while promoting large portfolio invest-\nments is not a proper policy option due to Pakistan\u2019s underdeveloped and\nnarrow capital market. Significant increases in commercial borrowings are\nalso not desirable. It is therefore crucial to accord high priority to foreign\ndirect  investment  (FDI).\n\nPrevious inflows of FDI in Pakistan were meager, accounting for\nonly 0.2% of the world total and less than one percent of the Asian sub-\ntotal  each  year  in  the  1990s. Among  the  major  impediments  are  urban\nviolence,  inconsistent  economic  policies,  and  government  bureaucracy.\nRemedial policy actions are essential.\n\nAnother major problem is the concentration of FDI on the power\nsector, a domestic-oriented sector, which results in large foreign exchange\ncosts and remittances. This has serious balance of payments implications.\nLessons learned from the Pakistan experience are: developing economies\nshould attach short-term priority to attracting FDI to the foreign exchange\nearning sector, or, at least, both the foreign exchange earning sector and\nother  sectors  simultaneously.  Multilateral  development  organizations,\nincluding the Asian Development Bank, should also take this into account\nin their private sector operations, particularly the build-own-transfer type,\nto develop economic infrastructures in developing economies.\n\n\f1\n\nI. Importance  of  Foreign  Direct  Investment\nin Pakistan\n\nThe Asian currency crisis that erupted in Thailand in July 1997 and has since spread\nto other countries, particularly Indonesia, Republic of Korea (Korea), and Malaysia, renewed\nthe significance of prudential management of foreign capital flows in developing countries\nwhere domestic financial markets are not yet fully developed. The crisis poses many chal-\nlenges to developing countries, including how to best supervise financial institutions, how\nto efficiently manage foreign exchange reserves/systems, and how to prudentially manage\nforeign debt and investments. From the viewpoint of foreign resource mobilization, the crisis\nhighlights  the  urgent  need  to  reexamine  the  optimal  combination  of  foreign  capital,  i.e.,\nproper  composition  of  concessional  public  loans,  commercial  loans,  portfolio  investment,\nand foreign direct investment. Volatile movements of portfolio investment triggered the Asian\ncrisis, which was reinforced by panic withdrawals of short-term commercial loans. How-\never, it did not have any relation to foreign direct investment (FDI) due to its high stability.\nThis underscores the importance of FDI in the developing member countries (DMCs), par-\nticularly the group of least developed DMCs where domestic financial markets are fragile\nand liquidity is limited. Pakistan belongs to this group. The size of its financial market is\nvery small and its foreign exchange and debt position is precarious. Over the last two years,\nforeign  exchange  reserves  in  Pakistan  have  remained  at  less  than  $1.3  billion,  which  was\nequivalent to only 4-5 weeks of imports of goods.1 Short-term debt has also increased from\n12%  of  total  debt  in  the  early  1990s  to  20%  at  present.\n\nThese  developments  increase  the  need  for  attracting  FDI  into  Pakistan.  FDI  is  a\nsignificant  long-term  commitment  and  a  part  of  the  host  economy  itself.  In  the  difficult\ncircumstances described above, Pakistan\u2019s policy on foreign capital mobilization must attach\npriority  to  (i)  official  multilateral  assistance;  (ii)  official  bilateral  assistance;  and  (iii)  FDI,\ngiven  its  very  limited  absorptive  capacity  for  portfolio  investment  and  commercial  bank\nloans.  However,  concessional  long-term  development  assistance,  both  multilateral  and\nbilateral,  will  become  increasingly  scarce  due  to  domestic  financial  constraints  in  major\ndonors, such as Japan, and Pakistan\u2019s increased competition with other least developed coun-\ntries  such  as  Bangladesh,  Mongolia,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Viet  Nam.  Multilateral  development\norganizations including the Asian Development Bank will focus on poverty alleviation and\nsoft sectors (i.e., agriculture, rural development, education, environment, poverty, and health),\nwhile the hard sectors (manufacturing and large-scale physical infrastructure) are expected\nto be invested in by the private sector and foreign investors as well as the Government of\nPakistan  (GOP).\n\nThe  positive  developmental  role  of  FDI  in  general  is  well  documented  (see,  for\nexample, Chen 1992). FDI produces a positive effect on economic growth in host countries.\nOne convincing argument for that is that FDI consists of a package of capital, technology\nmanagement, and market access. FDI tends to be directed at those manufacturing sectors\n\n1After the imposition of the G-7 economic sanctions in early June 1998 following Pakistan\u2019s nuclear\ntesting,  foreign  exchange  reserves  fell  to  $400-500  million.  However,  they  recovered  to  the  previous  level  of\n$1.2-1.3  billion  after  the  partial  waiver  of  the  G-7  sanctions  and  the  resumption  of  IMF  assistance  programs\nin  January  1999.\n\n\f2\n\nand  key  infrastructures  that  enjoy  actual  and  potential  comparative  advantage.  In  those\nsectors with comparative advantage, FDI would create economies of scale and linkage effects\nand  raise  productivity.  For  FDI,  repayment  is  required  only  if  investors  make  profit  and\nwhen they make profit, they tend to reinvest their profit rather than remit abroad. Another\nbenefit  of  FDI  is  a  confidence  building  effect.  While  the  local  economic  environment  de-\ntermines  the  overall  degree  of  investment  confidence  in  a  country,  inflows  of  FDI  could\nreinforce the confidence, contributing to the creation of a virtuous cycle that affects not only\nlocal and foreign investment but also foreign trade and production. This phenomenon well\nmatches the directions of historical flows of FDI in the Asian and Pacific region. Initially,\nFDI had surged into the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) (Hong Kong, China; Korea;\nSingapore;  and  Taipei,China)  and  thereafter  moved  to ASEAN  countries.  Recently,  it  has\nbeen changing its direction to People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, and Viet Nam. This\nchanging stream of FDI flows suggests that the degree of confidence building, inflows of\nFDI,  and  the  pace  of  economic  growth  seem  to  have  a  positive  interrelation  in  the Asian\nand Pacific region.\n\nThe inflow of FDI into Pakistan is small and concentrated only on a few areas, mostly\nin the power sector. In 1997 Pakistan accounted for 0.2% of world FDI, less than one per-\ncent of developing country and Asian country FDI, and 18% of South Asian countries\u2019 FDI.2\nIn  spite  of  liberalizing  its  formerly  inward-looking  FDI  regime,  tempering  or  removal  of\nobstacles to foreign investors, and according various incentives, Pakistan\u2019s performance in\nattracting FDI has been lackluster. Why could Pakistan not succeed in attracting sufficiently\nlarge FDI despite liberalizing its payments and exchange regime as well as inward FDI re-\ngime? The present study attempts to find out the answer. Rather, a relatively large inflow\nof FDI into the power sector since 1995 has created some adverse effects, most important\nof which was the large increase in imports of capital goods for construction of power plants,\nand the ongoing conflict between the government and foreign independent power producers\n(IPPs) on the power rate the government needs to pay to IPPs under the purchase contract.\nAnother negative effect of FDI concentration on the power sector was that as the remittances\nby IPPs began to increase, it severely constrained the balance of payments, given that foreign\nexchange earnings through exports of goods and services remain low.3 From this undesirable\npattern of FDI in Pakistan, very important lessons could be drawn for developing econo-\nmies:  they  should  be  careful  in  allowing  a  large  amount  of  FDI  to  nonforeign-exchange-\nearning sectors during a short period of time; and FDI should be promoted in the foreign-\nexchange-earning sector at the initial stage and to the domestic-oriented sector at the sub-\nsequent  stages,  or,  at  least,  to  both  sectors  simultaneously.\n\nII. Review  of  FDI  Policy\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPolicies of host countries have an important influence on foreign investment deci-\nsions. Host countries can adopt policies of stimulating foreign investment or they can restrict\nforeign participation in their economies in various ways. Host country policies and policy\n\n2See Appendix  table.\n3Exports  of  services  here  imply  mostly  overseas  workers. Annual  remittances  of  overseas  workers\n\ninclusive  of  their  foreign  currency  deposits  amount  to  about  $3  billion.\n\n\f3\n\npronouncements affect the perception of \u201cpolitical risk\u201d by transnational corporations (TNCs)\nand thereby the amount of investment of these companies. In addition, host country policies\ncan  be  instrumental  in  channeling  investment  flows  toward  sectors  considered  to  be  of\nparticular  importance  to  the  country\u2019s  development.4\n\nPakistan was basically an agricultural economy upon its independence in 1947. Its\nindustrial capacity was negligible for processing locally produced agricultural raw material.\nThis made it imperative for succeeding governments to improve the country\u2019s manufacturing\ncapacity. In order to achieve this objective, however, changing types of industrial policies\nhave been implemented in different times with a changing focus on either the private sector\nor the public sector. During the 1960s, government policies were aimed at encouraging the\nprivate  sector  while  during  the  1970s,  the  public  sector  was  given  the  dominant  role.  In\nthe 1980s and 1990s, the private sector was again assigned a leading role. Especially during\nthe decade of the 1990s, Pakistan adopted liberal, market-oriented policies and declared the\nprivate  sector  the  engine  of  economic  growth.  Moreover,  Pakistan  has  also  offered  an\nattractive  package  of  incentives  to  foreign  investors.\n\nB. A Brief Review of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s\n\nThe private sector was the main vehicle for industrial investment during the 1950s\nand  the  1960s  and  the  involvement  of  the  public  sector  was  restricted  to  three  out  of  27\nbasic industries.5 It was also set that in the event of private capital not forthcoming for the\ndevelopment of any particular industry of national importance, the public sector might set\nup a limited number of standard units. By the late 1960s the economy was largely dominated\nby  the  private  sector  in  important  areas  like  banking,  insurance,  certain  basic  industries,\nand international trade in major commodities.6 The services sector was reserved for local\ninvestors.  Foreign  investment  was  not  allowed  in  the  field  of  banking,  insurance,  and\ncommerce.\n\nOn  1  January  1972,  the  GOP  issued  an  Economic  Reforms  Order  taking  over  the\nmanagement of ten major categories of industries,7 commercial banks, development financial\ninstitutions, and insurance companies. In 1975 there was another round of nationalization\nof small-sized agroprocessing units. The sudden shift toward nationalization of private sector\nindustrial  units  shattered  private  investors\u2019  confidence. At  the  same  time  there  was  also\nacceleration  in  the  direct  investment  by  the  public  sector  in  new  industries  ranging  from\nthe basic manufacture of steel to the production of garments and breads. The status of the\npublic sector as a catalyst and gap filler in the 1950s and 1960s changed to that of repository\nof the \u201ccommanding heights\u201d of the economy (see Government of Pakistan 1984).  All foreign\ninvestment  was,  however,  exempted  from  the  purview  of  the  nationalization.\n\n4For  a  detailed  discussion  on  this  issue,  see  ESCAP  (1995).\n5The  three  basis  industries  were  (i)  generation  of  hydroelectric  power;  (ii)  arms  and  ammunition;\n\nand  (iii)  manufacturing  of  railway  wagons,  telephones,  telegraph  lines,  and  wireless  apparatus.\n\n6For  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  early  period\u2019s  industrialization,  see  Naseem  (1981).\n7The  10  major  categories  of  industries  include:  iron  and  steel,  heavy  engineering,  assembly  and\nmanufacturing  of  motor  vehicles,  assembly  and  manufacturing  of  tractors,  heavy  basic  chemicals,  petro-\nchemicals,  cement,  public  utilities,  gas,  and  oil  refineries.\n\n\f4\n\nC. The  1980s\n\nAfter  the  dismal  performance  of  the  industrial  sector  following  the  1972  national-\nization, a change occurred in September 1978 in the government\u2019s approach toward the role\nof the public and private sectors. The role of the public sector was restricted to consolidating\nexisting  enterprises,  and  further  investment  in  this  sector  was  strictly  restricted.  The  role\nof  the  public  sector  was  elaborated  in  the  industrial  policy  statement  enunciated  in  June\n1984. The statement reiterated that the government would continue to pursue a pattern of\na  mixed  economy,  with  the  private  and  public  sector  reinforcing  each  other. At  the  same\ntime it admitted that the public sector had established its managerial and entrepreneurial\nfoundations and was in a position to chart its future course to create a supportive relationship\nbetween  the  public  and  private  sectors.  Industries  like  steel,  fertilizer,  cement,  petroleum\nrefining and petrochemicals, and automotive equipment engineering  were still in the realm\nof the public sector. The private sector was, however, permitted to participate in these fields\nas  these  were  not  an  exclusive  preserve  of  the  public  sector  anymore.\n\nThe industrial policy statement of 1984 not only accorded equal importance to the\npublic and private sectors but also encouraged the private sector to come forward. How-\never, the process of privatization was not initiated. Had this been initiated, Pakistan might\nhave attracted a considerable amount of foreign direct investment in subsequent periods.8\nThe public sector retained its role in major industrial areas, which obviously discouraged\nthe  inflows  of  FDI.9\n\nThe procedure for obtaining permission to set up an industry was somewhat restric-\ntive. The government sanction for some categories of investment was considered essential\nto ensure that the major projects of national significance or in need of government\u2019s pric-\ning policy and other support measures were established with government knowledge and\ninvolvement. The government\u2019s sanction was required for setting up projects in the following\ncategories:\n\n(i)\n\nindustries specified for reasons of overcapacity; price regulation; and imple-\nmentation of a program of assembly-cum-manufacture, requiring indigenous\nmanufacture of components or projects of major national importance or for\nreligion, security, or socioeconomic objectives\n\n(ii)\n\nprojects  involving  foreign  private  investment\n\n(iii)\n\nlarge  projects  costing  PRs  300  million  and  above\n\n8It was an ideal time to initiate privatization to attract FDI because economic fundamentals were strong.\nFor example, during the first half of the 1980s real GDP grew at an average rate of 6.7% per annum, manu-\nfacturing by 9.5%, investment and saving rates averaged 17.2% and 14.0% respectively, rate of inflation averaged\n7.8%, budget deficit as percentage of GDP averaged 6.3%, while current account deficit as percentage of GDP\naveraged  3.8  percent.  Besides  strong  economic  fundamentals,  there  was  no  serious  law  and  order  problem\nin the major growth poles of the country. Above all, notwithstanding military dictatorship, there was political\nstability  in  the  country.\n\n9FDI through privatization accounted for 14% and 67% of total FDI inflows into Latin America and\nthe Caribbean and Central and Eastern Europe, respectively. For a detailed discussion on this, see UNCTAD\n(1994).\n\n\f5\n\n(iv)\n\nprojects requiring cash foreign exchange of more than PRs 50 million equiva-\nlent  for  plant  and  machinery\n\n(v)\n\nprojects  involving  the  import  of  secondhand  machinery\n\n(vi)\n\nprojects  in  which  more  than  60%  of  the  raw  material  was  importable,  pro-\nvided the value of each import exceeded 20% of the total investment in fixed\nassets\n\nThe industries included in the above categories required the clearance of the Central\nInvestment Promotion Committee (CIPC) and the approval of the Federal Government. The\nabove-mentioned restrictions and the need to obtain permission for setting up an industry\nin  these  areas  were  applicable  to  both  local  and  foreign  investors.  In  addition  to  this,  all\nproject  proposals  involving  foreign  investment  required  government  approval  and  were\nrequired to be filed in the first instance with the Investment Promotion Bureau (IPB). Foreign\nprivate  investment  was  encouraged  in  the  form  of  joint  equity  participation  with  local\ninvestors and in the areas where advanced technology, managerial and technical skills, and\nmarketing expertise were involved. Adequate legal framework for foreign investment was\nprovided through the Foreign Private Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act 1976. This\nAct provided for security against expropriation and adequate compensation for acquisition.\nThe Act also guaranteed the remittance of profit and capital, remittance of appreciation of\ncapital investment, and relief from double taxation for countries with which Pakistan had\nagreement on avoidance of double taxation. Foreign investment was also encouraged in in-\ndustrial projects involving advanced technology and heavy capital outlay like engineering,\nbasic chemicals, petrochemicals, electronics, and other capital goods industries.\n\nIn  order  to  encourage  foreign  direct  investment  in  export-oriented  industries,  an\nExport Processing Zone (EPZ) was set up in Karachi. Apart from foreign investors, over-\nseas  Pakistanis  were  also  encouraged  to  invest  in  industrial  projects  in  the  EPZ  on  a\nnonrepatriable investment basis. The concessions and facilities offered by the EPZ included\nduty-free imports and exports of goods and tax exemptions. Overseas Pakistanis were ex-\nempted from disclosing the origin of the funds for investment and were allowed to bring\nsecondhand  machinery  without  any  surveyor  certificate.\n\nDespite these incentives, the highly regulated nature of Pakistan\u2019s economy proved\na deterrent to the inflows of FDI. Specifically, FDI was discouraged by: (i) significant public\nownership,  strict  industrial  licensing,  and  price  controls  by  the  GOP;  (ii)  the  inefficient\nfinancial sector with mostly public ownership, directed credits, and segmented markets; and\n(iii)  a  noncompetitive  and  distorting  trade  regime  with  import  licensing,  bans,  and  high\ntariffs.\n\nPakistan began to implement a more liberal foreign investment policy as part of its\noverall economic reform program toward the end of the 1980s. Accordingly, a new industrial\npolicy package was introduced in 1989 based on the recognition of the primacy of the private\nsector. A  number  of  policy  and  regulatory  measures  were  taken  to  improve  the  business\nenvironment in general and attract FDI in particular. A Board of Investment (BOI), attached\nto the Prime Minister's Secretariat, was set up to help generate opportunities for FDI and\nprovide  investment  services. A  \u201cone-window  facility\u201d  was  established  to  overcome  diffi-\nculties  in  setting  up  new  industries.\n\n\f6\n\nD. The  1990s\n\nThe  basic  rules  on  foreign  investment  as  stated  above  were  laid  down  in  the  For-\neign  Private  Investment  (Promotion  and  Protection) Act  1976.  Originally,  each  foreign\ninvestment was subject to separate authorization, but this requirement was eliminated in\nMay 1991. In general, no special registration was required for FDI, and the same rules and\nregulations were applied to FDI as to domestic investors. The requirement for government\napproval of foreign investment was removed with the exception of a few industries such\nas  arms  and  ammunition,  security  printing,  currency  and  mint,  high  explosives,  radioac-\ntive substances, and alcoholic beverages (in fact, these industries were also closed to domestic\nprivate investors). In all industrial sectors other than those indicated above, not only for-\neign equity participation of up to 100% was allowed but also, foreign investors can purchase\nequity in existing industrial companies on a repatriable basis. In nonindustrial sectors, foreign\ninvestment was excluded from agricultural land; forestry; irrigation; and real estate including\nland, housing, and commercial activities.10\n\nAll investors, whether domestic or foreign, were required to obtain a No Objection\nCertificate (NOC) from the relevant provincial government for location of their projects. Thus,\nthe physical location of the investment was effectively controlled by the provincial govern-\nments,  which  was  considered  a  major  bottleneck  in  speedy  industrialization. At  present,\nan NOC is only required for foreign investment in areas that are in the negative list of the\nrelevant provincial government. There are only a small number of areas that are on the nega-\ntive  list  of  the  provincial  governments.\n\nIn the past, investors (domestic and foreign) were not free to negotiate the terms and\nconditions of payment of royalty and technical fees suited to the requirements of foreign\ncollaborators for technology transfer. The government, therefore, streamlined the procedures\nand investors are now free to negotiate the terms of conditions suited to them as well as\nacceptable  to  multinationals  wishing  to  transfer  the  requisite  technology.\n\nOne of the most important measures taken recently by the government affecting FDI\nhas  been  the  liberalization  of  the  foreign  exchange  regime.  Residents  and  nonresident\nPakistanis and foreigners are now allowed to bring in, possess, and take out foreign cur-\nrency, and to open accounts and hold certificates on foreign currency. Foreigners using foreign\nexchange  have  now  access  to  the  capital  market.  For  example,  no  permission  is  required\nto  issue  shares  of  Pakistani  companies  to  foreign  investors,  unless  they  belong  to  indus-\ntries  included  in  the  Specified  List.  To  further  liberalize  the  foreign  exchange  regime,  the\nPakistani rupee has been made convertible effective 1 July 1994. The ceiling earlier imposed\non contracting foreign loans has been abolished. Permission of the Federal Government or\nthe SBP would not be required regarding interest rate or payment period of foreign loans\nnot guaranteed by the Government of Pakistan. Foreign currency account holders are now\nalso allowed to obtain rupee loans collateralized against the foreign currency account balance.\nThe government has also enacted an extensive set of investment incentives including\ncredit facilities, fiscal incentives, and visa policy. Foreign-controlled manufacturing companies\nexporting 50% or more of their production can now borrow working capital without any\nlimit. Other foreign-controlled manufacturing companies including those not exporting and\nselling in the domestic market can borrow rupee loans equal to their equity without prior\n\n10FDI in nonindustrial sectors is not necessarily subject to the same treatment as domestic investment\n\n(see  UNCTAD  1994).\n\n\f7\n\npermission of the SBP. Prior permission of SBP is also not required for raising domestic credit\nto  meet  fixed  investment  requirement.\n\nA  number  of  fiscal  incentives  include  a  three-year  tax  holiday  to  all  industries\nthroughout  Pakistan  set  up  between  1  December  1990  and  30  June  1995.  Investments  in\ndelineated rural areas, industrial zones, and less developed areas enjoy five and eight years\ntax holiday respectively, together with special custom duty and sales tax concessions. The\nimport policy has also been liberalized considerably, and the maximum tariff rate has been\nreduced from 225% in 1986/1987 to 45% in 1996/1997. A large number of quantitative re-\nstrictions and nontariff barriers have been removed, and the negative and prohibited lists\nof imports have also been reduced (see BOI 1995b).11 Export incentives have also been broad-\nened.  The  highly  cumbersome  duty-drawback  system  is  being  replaced  with  a  scheme\nwhereby 80% of the duty-drawback is paid automatically within three days to the firm, and\nthe  remaining  20%  is  paid  within  one  week  after  inquiry.\n\nThe visa policy of Pakistan has been modified to make it attractive to foreign inves-\ntors. Foreign investors with substantial investment are granted 3 years multiple entry visa.\nThere is no restriction/requirement for work permit for foreign managerial and technical\npersonnel  for  gainful  employment/occupation  in  private  firms  in  Pakistan.\n\nSpecial  industrial  zones  (SIZs)  have  been  set  up  to  attract  foreign  investment  in\nexport-oriented industries. Apart from foreign investors, Pakistanis working abroad are also\neligible to invest in SIZs. The government is responsible for providing the necessary infra-\nstructure  and  utility  services  in  the  SIZs.  Investment  in  SIZs  are  exempted  from  existing\nlabor laws of the country. Hefty fiscal incentives are given to foreign investors in the SIZs,\nwhich include income tax holiday for a period of 10 years provided the plant commences\ncommercial operation as of 30 June 1999; duty-free imports of plant and machinery not manu-\nfactured locally; and tax exemption on capital gains, to the extent of the foreign equity share,\nfor  a  period  of  five  years  from  the  inception  of  the  venture.12\n\nForeign investment in Pakistan is protected through the Constitution (Article 24) as\nwell  as  through  specific  laws.  Section  8  of  the  Protection  of  Economic  Reforms Act  1992\nprovides  legal  cover  to  foreign  investment  in  Pakistan.\n\nBeside  these  statutory  protections,  the  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee Agency\n(MIGA) provides a means of obtaining insurance cover against noncommercial risks. Pakistan\nis a top beneficiary of the MIGA investment cover. MIGA has provided Pakistan with 9.4%\nof  its  investment  insurance  facilities,  the  highest  among  other  developing  countries.\n\nIn November 1997, the government issued the New Investment Policy which includes\nmajor policy initiatives. In the past, foreign investment was restricted to the manufactur-\ning sector. Now foreign investment is allowed in sectors like agriculture and services, which\nconstitute above three fourths of gross national product. The main objective of the new policy\nis  to  enhance  the  level  of  foreign  investment  in  the  fields  of  industrial  base  expansion,\ninfrastructure and software development, electronics, engineering, agro-food, value-added\ntextile,  tourism,  and  construction  industries.  Foreign  investment  on  a  repatriable  basis  is\nnow also allowed in agriculture, services, infrastructure, and social sectors, subject to these\nconditions:  (i)  the  basis  is  joint  venture  (60:40);  (ii)  foreign  equity  will  be  at  least  $1  mil-\nlion;  (iii)  foreign  companies  registered  in  Pakistan  will  be  allowed  to  invest;  and  (iv)  for\nsocial sector and infrastructure projects, joint venture is waived (100% foreign equity may\nbe  allowed).\n\n11For  a  detailed  discussion  on  Pakistan\u2019s  trade  and  tariff  policy,  see  M.Z.  Khan  (1996).\n12For  further    details  on  incentives  and  concessions  in  the  SIZs,  see  BOI  (1995a).\n\n\f8\n\nThe  manufacturing  sector  has  also  been  prioritized  into  four  categories:  (i)  value-\nadded or export industries; (ii) hi-tech industries; (iii) priority industries; and (iv) agro-based\nindustries. The tariff on imported plant, machinery, and equipment (PME) that are not manu-\nfactured locally for categories (i), (ii), and agriculture is zero while that for categories (iii),\n(iv),  and  social  services  will  be  charged  10%.  First  year  allowance  of  cost  of  PME  would\nbe available at 90% for (i) and (ii), at 75% for categories (iii) and (iv), and at 50% for other\nindustries. Reinvestment allowance for expansion would be allowed at 50% of cost of PME.\nNotwithstanding significant deregulation and various incentives/concessions given\nto foreign investors, Pakistan still faces serious problems as far as implementation of for-\neign investment policies are concerned. There is a strong perception among foreign investors\nthat the probusiness policies and inducement used to attract prospective new investors are\nsomehow weak given realities when they actually begin to set up and operate their busi-\nness  in  Pakistan.\n\nIII. Trends,  Issues,  Foreign  Direct  Investment,\nand  Economic  Impact  of  FDI\n\nA. Trends\n\nThe success of FDI policies can be judged by the size of the inflows of capital. Pakistan\nhas been making efforts to attract FDI and such efforts have been intensified with the advent\nof deregulation, privatization, and liberalization policies initiated at the end of the 1980s.\nTable 1 documents the size of the inflow of foreign investment in Pakistan during the last\ntwo decades. The amount of foreign investment rose from a tiny $10.7 million in 1976/1977\nto $1296 million in 1995/1996, thus growing at the annual compound growth rate of 25.7\npercent. However, it declined to $950 million in 1996/1997. With the beginning of the overall\nliberalization program (1991/1992 onwards) the inflow of foreign investment grew at the\ncompound growth rate of 15.2 percent. Investment inflows in 1995/1996 increased by 93.3%\nmainly  due  to  the  inflow  of  investment  in  power  sector.\n\nAlthough significant by absolute terms, the increase appears trivial when compared\nto the relatively more buoyant economies of East and Southeast Asia. While FDI flows to\nall developing countries reached $150 billion in 1997, East and Southeast Asia received the\nbulk  of  this  share.\n\nTotal foreign investment consists of direct and portfolio investment. Prior to 1991/\n1992,  portfolio  investment  has  not  only  been  low  but  also  exhibited  a  fluctuating  trend.\nHowever, with the beginning of liberalization policies in 1991/1992, portfolio investment\ncrossed the $1.0 billion mark in 1994/1995. This impressive increase does not reflect the true\npicture of the trends in portfolio investment witnessed during the postliberalization period.\nIf the $862.2 million sale of Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) vouchers, which\nwas a one-time phenomenon, was excluded, the portfolio investment not only declined to\n$227.8 million in 1994/1995 but followed an average trend of $215.4 million during 1991/\n1992 to 1995/1996 as against an average flows of only $9.0 million prior to reform (1984/\n1985  to  1990/1991).13\n\n13The  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  publishes  direct  and  portfolio  investment  separately  from  1984/1985\n\nonwards.\n\n\f9\n\nTABLE  1\nInflow  of  Foreign  Investment  in  Pakistan\n(million  $)\n\nDirect\n\nPortfolio\n\nTotal\n\nDirect\n\nPortfolio\n\nPercent  of  Total\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n70.3\n145.2\n\n108.0\n162.2\n\n210.2\n216.2\n\n246.0\n335.1\n\n306.4\n354.1\n\n442.4\n(442.4)\n\n1090.7\n682.1\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n23.4\n16.0\n\n21.0\n10.5\n\n7.2\n-4.7\n\n-9.0\n218.5\n\n136.8\n288.6\n\n1089.9\n(227.8)\n\n205.2\n267.4\n\n10.7\n35.5\n\n36.0\n28.2\n\n35.0\n98.0\n\n42.1\n48.0\n\n93.7\n161.2\n\n129.0\n172.7\n\n217.4\n211.5\n\n237.0\n553.6\n\n443.2\n642.7\n\n1532.3\n(670.2)\n\n1295.9\n949.5\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n75.0\n90.0\n\n83.7\n93.9\n\n96.7\n102.2\n\n103.8\n60.5\n\n69.1\n55.1\n\n28.9\n(66.0)\n\n84.2\n71.8\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n25.0\n10.0\n\n16.3\n6.1\n\n3.3\n-2.2\n\n-3.8\n39.5\n\n30.9\n44.9\n\n71.1\n(34.0)\n\n15.8\n28.2\n\nYear\n\n1976/77\n1977/78\n\n1978/79\n1979/80\n\n1980/81\n1981/82\n\n1982/83\n1983/84\n\n1984/85\n1985/86\n\n1986/87\n1987/88\n\n1988/89\n1989/90\n\n1990/91\n1991/92\n\n1992/93\n1993/94\n\n1994/95\n(1994/95*)\n\n1995/96\n1996/97\n\nSource:  State  Bank  of  Pakistan.\nNotes:Direct  investment  consists  of  cash,  capital  equipment  brought-in  and  reinvested  earnings.\n\n* = Excluding  862.2  million  of  PTC  Vouchers\n\nForeign participation appears to be the major factor responsible for the increase in\nportfolio  investment  in  the  1990s.  The  decline  in  international  interest  rates  was  also\nimportant in portfolio allocations toward Pakistani assets. With globalization, numerous in-\nternational  portfolio  funds  were  created  that  were  invested  in  emerging  capital  markets\nseeking for better returns. Pakistan was among the first countries in emerging markets to\ntake  measures  to  open  up  its  stock  markets  to  foreign  investors.  However,  in  relation  to\nthe total flows directed to developing countries, interest in Pakistan has been very modest\n(Khan 1996). Portfolio inflows, because of their inherently volatile nature, have proved to\nbe  reversible  more  than  other  forms  in  developing  countries.  Their  potential  volatility  is\ngreat in Pakistan as well since portfolio investment in Pakistan is directed mainly toward\nshort-term  and  some  medium-term  public  debt  instruments  and  the  stock  exchanges.\n\n\f10\n\nThe  major  component  of  the  total  foreign  investment  is  FDI. As  can  be  seen  from\nTable 1, despite yearly fluctuations, the amount of FDI rose from $70.3 million in 1984/1985\nto  $1090.7  million  in  1995/1996,  thus  growing  at  the  compound  growth  rate  of  25.7  per-\ncent.  However,  it  decreased  to  $682  million  in  1996/1997.  Since  the  beginning  of  the\nliberalization program (1991/1992), FDI has grown faster than in the preliberalization period\n(1984/1985-1990/1991). In particular, 1995/1996 registered a phenomenal growth of 146.5%\nmainly due to the inflow of FDI in the power sector. FDI, on average, accounted for nearly\n80-85%  of  total  inflows  over  the  period  1984/1985  to  1996/1997.\n\nTable  2  reports  the  inflow  of  FDI  by  origin  since  1981/1982.  The  US  and  UK  have\nbeen  the  major  sources  of  FDI  in  Pakistan,  although  the  shares  of  both  US  and  UK  have\nfluctuated widely, falling as low as 8.8% for the US and 4.7% for the UK and rising as high\nas 63.7% and 35.2%, respectively. The share of the US has been, by far, the largest of all the\ncountries, averaging 32.4% over the last 16 years followed by the UK (12.9%), UAE (11.6%),\nJapan (5.7%), and Germany (5.4%). During the post-reform era, the share of the US further\nrose  to  42.0%  followed  by  the  UK  (12.3%),  Japan  (6.4%),  Germany  (5.4%),  and  the  UAE\n(4.7%).  It  may  be  noted  that  Japan,  which  has  emerged  as  a  major  investor  globally\n(averaging $27.9 billion during 1990-1997), has annually invested only $32.3 million (or 0.1%)\nin  Pakistan  during  the  same  period.14\n\nTABLE  2\nShares  of  Inflow  of  FDI  from  Various  Countries\n(percent)\n\nYear\n\nUSA UK UAE Germany France\n\nItaly\n\nJapan Arabia Canada Netherlands Others\n\nHong Kong,\nChina\n\n1981/82\n1982/83\n\n1983/84\n1984/85\n\n1985/86\n1986/87\n\n1987/88\n1988/89\n\n1989/90\n1990/91\n\n1991/92\n1992/93\n\n1993/94\n1994/95\n\n1995/96\n1996/97\n\n15.5\n11.6\n\n8.8\n24.5\n\n24.2\n39.7\n\n28.2\n45.1\n\n43.4\n52.8\n\n63.7\n44.7\n\n32.2\n39.9\n\n29.3\n36.1\n\n19.9\n16.9\n\n16.3\n12.7\n\n8.6\n4.7\n\n15.7\n10.8\n\n10.5\n13.7\n\n6.1\n8.4\n\n9.0\n8.7\n\n29.1\n35.2\n\n8.4\n10.0\n\n8.2\n16.9\n\n47.9\n23.7\n\n15.0\n6.2\n\n7.3\n3.7\n\n3.1\n3.1\n\n2.1\n10.6\n\n4.8\n8.0\n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan.\n\n3.6\n3.3\n\n4.8\n9.1\n\n2.9\n5.0\n\n11.3\n4.8\n\n5.2\n5.1\n\n6.4\n11.8\n\n2.6\n4.0\n\n2.4\n2.6\n\n0.19\n0.23\n\n0.10\n1.71\n\n0.55\n1.39\n\n3..08\n3.68\n\n2.77\n2.88\n\n2.53\n1.98\n\n3.13\n3.05\n\n1.28\n1.5\n\n0.15\n0.06\n\n0.51\n0.85\n\n1.9\n6.20\n\n3.39\n3.01\n\n0.42\n1.34\n\n\u2014\n4.05\n\n0.34\n0.49\n\n3.11\n1.1\n\nSaudi\n\n0.23\n2.6\n\n2.5\n5.4\n\n-5.0\n0.92\n\n0.55\n0.24\n\n0.51\n0.36\n\n0.03\n2.67\n\n0.54\n0.20\n\n2.46\n-2.49\n\n0.02\n0.01\n\n0.43\n0.50\n\n\u2014 0.45\n9.53\n\n0.14\n\n0.27\n0.37\n\n0.67\n0.57\n\n1.75\n1.18\n\n0.59\n0.19\n\n0.08\n0.06\n\n0.04\n0.26\n\n4.33\n8.7\n\n8.38\n8.0\n\n7.45\n10.65\n\n5.28\n7.18\n\n8.38\n3.68\n\n7.52\n5.37\n\n0.30\n0.23\n\n0.21\n0.43\n\n\u2014\n0.74\n\n0.62\n0.43\n\n0.42\n0.77\n\n0.90\n0.09\n\n0.34\n0.09\n\n0.07\n0.25\n\n1.52\n3.34\n\n1.35\n9.71\n\n0.89\n0.55\n\n0.25\n0.81\n\n2.45\n0.93\n\n0.24\n1.83\n\n-0.03\n1.02\n\n1.09\n0.1\n\n49.8\n51.3\n\n56.8\n9.1\n\n13.5\n8.0\n\n12.8\n16.3\n\n17.8\n6.6\n\n11.1\n14.1\n\n41.3\n28.2\n\n18.8\n11.0\n\n14The cautious investment attitude of Japanese businessmen toward Pakistan is well documented in\n\nShirouzu  (1993).  This  will  be  discussed  in  Section  IIID.\n\n\f11\n\nB.\n\nStructural  Pattern  of  FDI\n\nFDI in Pakistan consists primarily of three elements, namely, cash brought in, capital\nequipment brought in, and re-invested earnings. The information provided in Table 3 shows\nthat  the  structure  of  the  sources  of  financing  FDI  in  Pakistan  has  undergone  a  noticeable\nchange. Though all the components of FDI exhibit considerable fluctuations over time, the\nitem labeled capital equipment brought in has remained substantially low during 1983-1988.\nThough the major share of FDI in Pakistan comprised cash brought in (on average 55.7%\nover the last 15 years), its share declined slightly (on average 50.2% during 1991-1994) during\nthe post-reform period. The share of capital equipment brought in remained low, on average,\nover  the  last  15  years  but  it  has  made  considerable  improvement  during  the  postreform\nperiod. In particular, its share jumped to 55.7% in 1994 mainly due to the equipment brought\nin for Hubco Power Plant. Re-invested earnings contributed slightly less than one third to\nFDI over the last 15 years but its share has declined to 23% during the postreform period.\n\nTABLE  3\nInflow  of  FDI  by  Type\n(million  PRs)\n\nCapital\nTotal\nEquipment\nAssets Brought  In Brought  In\n\nCash\n\nYears\n\nRe-Invested\nEarnings\n\nCash\nBrought  In\n\nEquipment Reinvested\n  Earnings\nBrought  In\n\nPercent  of  Total  Assets\n\nCapital\n\n126.1\n247.7\n206.5\n\n391.9\n273.9\n489.9\n\n1133.6\n912.4\n1344.9\n\n1988.4\n4014.5\n4093.8\n\n90.8\n83.7\n105.9\n\n15.3\n9.6\n10.9\n\n19.3\n18.9\n315.0\n\n607.1\n490.5\n382.0\n\n9001.5\n11170.4\n24013.8\n\n3642.1\n7225.8\n7778.31\n\n2975.6\n1292.6\n13371.8\n\n293.3\n432.8\n458.3\n\n534.7\n511.0\n752.1\n\n1528.3\n1905.9\n2396.0\n\n3768.9\n6013.4\n6441.4\n\n1980\n1981\n1982\n\n1983\n1984\n1985\n\n1986\n1987\n1988\n\n1989\n1990\n1991\n\n1992\n1993\n1994\n\nAverage\n1980-94\n1991-94\n\n76.4\n101.4\n145.9\n\n127.5\n227.5\n251.3\n\n375.4\n974.6\n736.1\n\n1173.4\n1508.1\n1965.6\n\n2383.8\n2652.0\n2863.7\n\n42.9\n57.2\n45.0\n\n73.3\n53.6\n65.1\n\n74.2\n47.9\n56.1\n\n52.7\n66.7\n63.5\n\n40.4\n64.7\n32.4\n\n55.7\n50.2\n\n31.0\n19.2\n23.1\n\n2.9\n1.9\n1.4\n\n1.3\n1.0\n0.8\n\n16.1\n8.1\n5.9\n\n33.0\n11.6\n55.7\n\n14.2\n26.5\n\n26.1\n23.4\n31.8\n\n23.8\n44.5\n33.4\n\n24.5\n51.1\n40.7\n\n31.1\n25.1\n30.5\n\n26.5\n23.7\n11.9\n\n30.1\n23.3\n\nSource:  State  Bank  of  Pakistan,  Foreign  Liabilities  and  Assets  and  Foreign  Investment  in  Pakistan  (various  issues).\n\n\f12\n\n On average, during 1980-1994, 30% of FDI in Pakistan originated from re-invested\nearnings, whereas 70% (55.7% as cash and 14.2% as capital equipment) came from abroad.\nDuring  the  postreform  a  structural  shift  appears  to  have  taken  place  as  the  share  of\nre-invested earnings in total FDI declined to 23% while those coming from abroad rose to\n77  percent.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  share  of  re-invested  earnings  in  FDI  has  been\ndeclining since 1990, falling from 31% in 1989 to 12% in 1994. There appears to be two rea-\nsons for such a rapid decline. Firstly, as a result of chronic inflation, the cost of production\nhas gone up considerably and along with the plethora of taxes due to the fiscal consider-\nation, the after tax profit of foreign firms has declined. Consequently, the reinvested earnings\nthat originate as savings from the investment previously made have slowed down. Secondly,\nas a result of liberalization, the entry barriers of foreign firms were removed, which led to\nhigher inflows of new investment. Consequently, the relative share of re-invested earnings\nin  total  FDI  declined  considerably  after  1990.\n\nC. Sectoral  Distribution  of  FDI\n\nHaving  examined  the  trends  and  structural  pattern  of  FDI,  it  is  worthwhile  to  re-\nview  its  overall  sectoral  distribution  pattern.  The  analysis  of  sectoral  distribution  of  FDI\nmay reflect two things: on the one hand, it may reflect the preferential treatment given by\nthe  government  to  certain  sectors  while  encouraging  FDI,  and  on  the  other  hand,  it  may\nalso indicate the foreign investors\u2019 own preferences.\n\nAs  revealed  by  the  information  presented  in  Tables  4  and  5,  a  noteworthy  change\ncan be easily observed in the sectoral composition of FDI flow into Pakistan over the last\n15 years. On the broad sectoral basis, manufacturing industries, mining and quarrying, and\ncommerce are seen to have traditionally dominated the preferences of the foreign investors\nduring 1980-1994 accounting for over 83% of total inflow of FDI. However, like total FDI\nflows, sectoral shares also exhibit considerable year-to-year fluctuations. For example, the\nsectoral share of manufacturing industries, though highest, continued to fluctuate violently\novertime, falling from 74.6% in 1982 to 26.0% in 1983 and once again rising to 54.7% in 1984.\nThe share of manufacturing industries in overall FDI averaged only 11% during 1987-1993\nbut rose to 35% in 1994. The general decline in manufacturing share is largely substituted\nby the rise in the share of mining and quarrying, which stood next to manufacturing (28.1%)\nover the last 15 years. It appears that foreign investors preferred the petroleum sector (natural\ngas  in  particular)  during  the  period. A  significant  change  in  the  composition  of  FDI  was\nalso witnessed during the prereform and postreform periods. Manufacturing and mining\nand  quarrying  registered  a  sharp  decline  during  the  postreform  period  as  against  the\nprereform era. On the other hand, commerce, construction, and utilities experienced sub-\nstantial increase in total FDI during the postreform period.15 It may be noted that the share\nof  utilities  in  total  FDI  jumped  from  almost  zero  in  1993  to  31.7%  in  1994.  This  massive\nincrease  was  entirely  due  to  the  inflow  of  FDI  in  the  power  sector  with  the  Hubco  Cor-\nporation  alone  accounting  for  Rs  7  billion  out  of  Rs  7.6  billion  in  1994.\n\n15A  sharp  increase  of  FDI  in  the  commerce  sector  during  1992-1994  is  due  mainly  to  the  inflow  in\n\nthe  financial  service  subsector.\n\n\f13\n\nIn the remaining economic sectors (i.e., agriculture, transport, storage and commu-\nnication) the flow of FDI has been meager and erratic because of the limited opportunities\nopen  for  foreign  exploitation  in  these  areas.16\n\nTABLE  4\nInflow  of  FDI  by  Economic  Group\n(million  Rs.)\n\nAgriculture,\nForestry,\nHunting, Mining and\n\nTransport,\n Storage, and\n\nYear\n\nand Fishing Quarrying Manufacturing Construction Utilities Commerce Communication Others\n\nTotal\n\n1980\n1981\n1982\n\n1983\n1984\n1985\n\n1986\n1987\n1988\n\n1989\n1990\n1991\n\n1992\n1993\n1994\n\n\u2014\n2.2\n0.7\n\n1.5\n1.4\n13.9\n\n6.2\n0.5\n\u2014\n\n44.6\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n68.4\n\n72.1\n81.6\n112.2\n\n236.9\n21.8\n134.6\n\n242.3\n1080.3\n1169.2\n\n2076.2\n2068.0\n2928.5\n\n373.1\n1100.9\n1105.4\n\n218.9\n260.8\n342.0\n\n139.0\n279.4\n251.7\n\n403.3\n186.2\n281.5\n\n322.9\n522.1\n1044.5\n\n1074.3\n1236.6\n8409.2\n\n3.9\n2.0\n1.9\n\n2.3\n0.8\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\u2014\n-3.5\n\n340.6\n641.0\n333.8\n\n3268.4\n1941.7\n2565.1\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n0.9\n0.9\n4.3\n\n\u2014\n1.3\n4.4\n\n863.4\n1.6\n7622.9\n\n5.2\n-16.6\n-5.0\n\n120.0\n150.3\n281.3\n\n569.9\n487.3\n740.4\n\n735.8\n2337.7\n2138.7\n\n3096.9\n6831.6\n3242.7\n\n1.5\n5.8\n1.2\n\n10.7\n10.8\n13.1\n\n55.6\n48.7\n124.0\n\n177.2\n300.3\n-68.4\n\n-23.9\n21.4\n487.9\n\n-8.3\n97.0\n5.3\n\n24.3\n46.5\n57.3\n\n67.9\n102.0\n80.1\n\n71.6\n143.1\n59.9\n\n349.3\n36.6\n512.2\n\n293.3\n432.8\n458.3\n\n534.7\n5110.0\n752.1\n\n1528.3\n1905.9\n2396.0\n\n3768.9\n6013.4\n6441.4\n\n9001.5\n11170\n24013\n\nSource: State Bank of  Pakistan, Foreign Liabilities and Assets and Foreign Investment in Pakistan (various issues).\n\nD. Factors  Influencing  the  Flow  of  FDI  in  Pakistan\n\nBefore the Asian crisis, the world had experienced rapid growth in the flow of FDI,\nwhich  rose  from  $204.2  billion  in  1990  to  $400.5  billion  in  1997  (see  Appendix  table).\nDeveloping countries have made impressive gains in attracting FDI, the flow rising from\n$33.7  billion  to  nearly  $150  billion  during  the  same  period.  The  gains  owe,  to  a  large  ex-\ntent, to the growing attractiveness of the PRC, which accounted for 30.4% of total FDI to\ndeveloping countries in 1997. The Asian countries have also strengthened their role as the\nlargest  developing-country  FDI  recipient  region  with  an  estimated  $87  billion  of  inflows\nin 1997. The East and Southeast Asian countries have attracted $82 billion in FDI in 1997\naccounting for 21% of the total world flows and 55% of total developing countries\u2019 flows.\n  Viewed  in  the  background  of  these  developments,  the  inflow  of  FDI  in  Pakistan\nremains  far  from  encouraging  despite  numerous  incentives  offered  to  foreign  investors,\nparticularly after the liberalization program initiated since 1991/1992. Incentives like 100%\nforeign  ownership  of  capital,  foreign  investors  operating  their  companies  without  enlist-\ning  in  the  local  stock  exchanges,  no  limit  for  remittance  of  profits  and  dividends  abroad,\n\n16As  stated  in  Section  II,  these  sectors  were  liberalized  only  in  November  1997.\n\n\fTABLE  5\nShares  of  Different  Economic  Groups  in  Total  FDI\n(percent)\n\nAgriculture,\nForestry,\nHunting,\nand Fishing\n\nMining and\nQuarrying Manufacturing\n\nConstruction Utilities Commerce Communication Others\n\nTransport,\n Storage, and\n\nYear\n\n1980\n1981\n1982\n\n1983\n1984\n1985\n\n1986\n1987\n1988\n\n1989\n1990\n1991\n\n1992\n1993\n1994\n\nAverage\n1980-94\n1991-94\n\n\u2014\n0.50\n0.15\n\n0.28\n0.27\n1.85\n\n0.40\n0.03\n\u2014\n\n1.18\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n0.28\n\n0.33\n\u2014\n\n24.6\n18.9\n24.5\n\n44.3\n4.3\n17.9\n\n27.8\n56.7\n48.8\n\n55.1\n34.4\n45.5\n\n4.1\n9.8\n4.6\n\n28.1\n16.0\n\n74.6\n60.2\n74.6\n\n26.0\n54.7\n33.5\n\n26.4\n9.8\n11.7\n\n8.6\n8.7\n16.2\n\n11.9\n11.1\n35.0\n\n30.9\n18.5\n\nSource: Calculated from the information contained in Table 4.\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n0.05\n0.05\n0.18\n\n\u2014\n0.02\n0.07\n\n9.59\n0.01\n31.74\n\n2.8\n10.3\n\n1.8\n-3.8\n-1.1\n\n2.2\n29.4\n37.4\n\n37.3\n25.6\n30.9\n\n19.5\n38.9\n33.2\n\n34.4\n61.1\n13.5\n\n24.3\n35.5\n\n0.5\n1.3\n0.3\n\n2.0\n2.1\n1.7\n\n3.6\n2.5\n5.2\n\n4.7\n5.0\n-1.1\n\n-0.3\n0.2\n2.0\n\n2.0\n0.2\n\n2.8\n22.4\n1.1\n\n4.5\n9.1\n7.6\n\n4.4\n5.4\n3.3\n\n1.9\n2.4\n0.9\n\n3.9\n0.3\n2.1\n\n4.4\n1.8\n\n14\n\n1.3\n0.46\n0.41\n\n0.43\n0.15\n0.3\n\n0.01\n\u2014\n-0.15\n\n9.04\n10.66\n5.18\n\n36.31\n17.38\n10.68\n\n6.1\n17.4\n\nallowing disinvestment of the originally invested capital at any time, and no prescribed limits\nfor remittance of royalties and technical fees abroad by foreign investors are highly com-\npetitive with incentives offered by many other developing countries to the prospective foreign\ninvestors.\n\nBesides these incentives, Pakistan with a population of about 130 million offers a vast\npotential for the marketing of both consumer and durable goods. Various incentives apart,\nthese two factors should alone have attracted a respectable amount of FDI in Pakistan. How-\never,  by  looking  at  the  amount  of  FDI  in  Pakistan  in  recent  years,  it  appears  that  the\nincentives  and  other  factors  have  resulted  in  limited  success.  Why  was  Pakistan  not  able\nto attract FDI like the PRC; Hongkong, China; Malaysia; and Thailand despite offering com-\npetitive incentives, favorable geographical location, and a relatively large population? This\nsection  attempts  to  provide  answers  to  this  query.\n\nA summary of host country determinants of FDI in general is given shortly. In view\nof  these  determinants,  the  fundamental  requirement  that  governs  foreign  investment  in\nPakistan revolves around ten main factors, which could be called the ten checkpoints. These\nare  political  stability;  law  and  order;  economic  strength;  government  economic  policies;\ngovernment bureaucracy; local business environment; infrastructure; quality of labor force;\nquality  of  life;  and  welcoming  attitude  (see  Shirouzu  1993).\n\n\f15\n\nHost  Country  Determinants  of  FDI\n\nHost  Country  Determinants\n\nType  of  FDI  Classified\nby  Motives  of  Firms\n\nPrincipal  Economic\nDeterminants  in  Host  Countries\n\nI.\n\nPolicy  Framework  for  FDI\n\nA.

Political turmoil could wipe out overnight even\nthe most lucrative investments and endanger the lives of personnel. Many investors have\npaid  a  heavy  price  for  overlooking  or  ignoring  this  factor  in  other  parts  of  the  world\n(Jegathesan 1995). Lack of political stability has been the hallmark of Pakistan during the\nlast eight years (1988-1996). Three elected governments were dismissed on various charges\nwhile four caretaker regimes each remained in power for only 90 days over the last eight\nyears. Such a frequent change in government accompanied by abrupt changes in policies\nand  programs  are  hardly  congenial  for  foreign  investors.\n\n(ii)\n\nLaw and Order\n\nAn unsatisfactory law and order situation keeps prospective foreign investors on the\nsidelines.  Safety  of  capital  and  the  security  for  the  personnel  engaged  in  the  projects  are\nessential ingredients that govern foreign investment. Unfortunately, Pakistan\u2019s law and order\nsituation has remained far from satisfactory in the major growth poles of the country. Karachi,\nthe largest industrial and commercial center and the only commercial port of the country,\nhas been disturbed in varying degrees since 1989. In recent years the law and order situ-\nation  has  also  deteriorated  in  the  Punjab  province.  Notwithstanding  attractive  incentives\noffered to foreign investors, this factor has discouraged them to set up their businesses in\nPakistan.17\n\nIn a recent survey, the International Asset Management Company (IAMC), an affiliate\nof the British-based Morgan Stanley Asset Management, found that the business environ-\nment in Pakistan has deteriorated considerably. The IAMC surveyed 115 leading listed and\nunlisted companies including multinationals operating in Karachi. The sector covered for\nthe survey included automobiles, banks, chemicals, insurance, energy, textile and apparel,\nfinancial services and electrical goods. Some 74% of investors answered that they had no\ninvestment plan for 1996/1997, while in 1995/1996 some 56% of those had not invested in\nPakistan. The key reason for the negative sentiment of businessmen was the deteriorating\nlaw  and  order  situation  in  Karachi.  Three  out  of  four  businessmen  interviewed  blamed\npolitical instability as the major constraint facing business today and over 59% of the 115\nrespondents  were  not  pleased  with  government  policies.\n\n(iii)\n\nEconomic Strength\n\nInvestors would not want to invest in a country where the economic fundamentals\nare so weak that it is unpredictable what the government would do next to prop up a sag-\nging economy. In countries of high economic strength, the investor is assured of a growing\nof high economic strength, economy, and of increased opportunities for business, as more\ngovernment development projects and private sector investments put purchasing power in\n\n17Business Recorder (26 March 1996), a local newspaper, quoted a member of the Japanese delegation\nto Karachi, as saying that \u201cthey were worried about the prevailing disturbed law and order situation in Karachi\nand that they also witnessed a strike in Karachi which in its wake paralyzed the city\u2019s business activity\u201d. These\nimpressions  of  the  visiting  Japanese  businessmen,  by  and  large,  explain  the  reservations  on  the  part  of  for-\neign  investors.\n\n\f17\n\nthe hands of the people. Increased purchasing power means increased positive multiplier\neffects on the economy and a source for stability. Furthermore, foreign investors are unlikely\nto increase their participation in economies that are expected to remain affected by foreign\nexchange  scarcities  for  several  years  into  the  future  (UNCTAD  1985).\n\nAs  compared  with  the  decade  of  the  1980s,  Pakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  imbalances\nworsened in the 1990s, along with the slowdown of economic activity. Annual average GDP\ngrowth  slowed  from  6.4%  in  the  1980s,  to  3-4%  in  the  1990s.  In  particular,  large-scale\nmanufacturing  has  slowed  down  to  2-3%  as  against  almost  8.0%  during  the  1980s.\n\nThe large fiscal deficit has emerged as a major source of macroeconomic imbalances\nin  Pakistan.  Slippages  on  both  the  revenue  and  expenditure  sides  contributed  to  mount-\ning financial imbalances. The rate of inflation has averaged 11% during the 1990s as against\nan average rate of 7.3% in the 1980s. Pakistan\u2019s external sector also remained under pres-\nsure  during  the  1990s  as  compared  with  the  1980s.  The  current  account  deficit  averaged\n4.4% of GDP as against 3.9% during the 1980s. Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have\nalso fluctuated in an unpredictable manner in the 1990s. Thus, attractive incentives notwith-\nstanding, the large macroeconomic imbalances and slowing down of economic activity must\nhave  discouraged  FDI  in  Pakistan.\n\n(iv)\n\nGovernment Economic Policies\n\nPakistan\u2019s  track  record  in  maintaining  consistent  economic  policies  has  been  poor.\nThe abrupt changes in policies with a change in government as well as a change in policy\nwithin  the  tenure  of  a  government  have  been  quite  common.  Pressures  to  raise  revenues\n(for fiscal consideration), and other conflicting objectives have generally led to inconsistencies\nin investment and industrialization policies, and an ad hoc and changing incentive system.\nRevenue  measures  are  not  in  harmony  with  the  industrial  policies.  Several  instances  of\nchange  in  policy  stance  in  recent  years  can  be  identified.  For  example,  the  process  of\nprivatization  slowed  down  considerably  with  the  change  in  government. As  against  the\nprivatization of 63 units in two years (1991/1992 and 1992/1993), only 20 units were priva-\ntized in three years (1993/1994 to 1995/1996). Similarly, with the change in government a\ndrastic  change  was  made  in  the  Lahore\u2013Islamabad  motorway  project. Another  example\nconcerns the concessions given to the petroleum and power sectors in terms of duty-free\nimports of machinery. Resource crunch forced the government to withdraw this concession\nby imposing a 10% regulatory duty in October 1995. It took several months to get the pe-\ntroleum sector concession restored but the regulatory duty was reimposed in the 1996/1997\nfederal budget.  The serious disagreement in 1998 between the GOP and IPPs on the purchase\nof  electricity  by  the  WAPDA  aggravated  investors\u2019  confidence.\n\nThe  investment  approval  requirement  has  been  removed  but  other  regulations  in-\nstituting the need for other administrative approvals, however, are still in place. Numerous\npermits and clearances from different government agencies at national, regional and local\nlevels  still  apply  to  investors.\n\nIncentives/concessions to foreign investment apart, private investors continue to face\na  plethora  of  federal,  provincial,  and  local  taxes  and  regulations.  Federal  levies  include\ncustom duties, sales tax, withholding tax at import stage, and excise duty. At the provincial\nlevel  there  are  stamp  duties,  professional  taxes,  boiler  inspection  fees,  and  weight  and\nmeasures fees. In addition, local government taxes are levied, including a local metropolitan\ntax, and the Octroi. At the federal and provincial levels, labor taxes have to be paid separately\n\n\f18\n\nin compliance with labor laws, such as the contributions to the Workers Welfare Fund, Social\nSecurity, worker\u2019s children\u2019s education, and workers participation in profit and group in-\nsurance. In particular, a 5% withholding tax at the import stage as well as restrictions that\nthese  firms  cannot  borrow  more  than  their  equity  capital  have  caused  serious  cash  flow\nproblems.\n\nForeign investors in Pakistan also have to cope with a complex legal situation. Law\nbased on different legal systems are applied independently. Uncertainty is exacerbated by\nthe practice of issuing Special Regulatory Orders (SROs) that can amend or alter existing\nlaws.  Over  time  many  SROs  have  been  issued  under  a  particular  law,  changing  its  scope\nand  intent.\n\n(v)\n\nGovernment Bureaucracy\n\nThis could perhaps be the biggest \u201cburden\u201d in any investment environment. It does\nnot matter how efficient the government thinks its investment policy is; what is critical is\nthe perception of businessmen, especially those already in the country. Do businessmen feel\nthat  they  have  the  support  of  government  officials  in  their  efforts  to  set  up  and  operate\nefficient business units, or do they feel that they have to fight the government to get projects\noff  the  ground?\n\nThe  general  perception  of  businessmen  in  Pakistan  is  that  there  exists  a  large  gap\nbetween  the  policies  and  their  implementation  (Shirouzu  1993).  The  implementation  of\npolicies has been slow and the bureaucracy has not responded to the initiatives with con-\nviction.18 Such perception about the slow implementation of policies is not at all conducive\nto  attracting  FDI.\n\n(vi)\n\nLocal Business Environment\n\nThis covers many factors, including the availability of local lawyers, secretarial ser-\nvices, accountants, architects and building contractors, local consultants, etc.\u2014all required\nboth  before  and  during  the  life  of  a  project. Also,  there  is  the  question  of  the  availability\nof ancillary and supporting industries, their quality, and their cost. Another question would\nbe the availability of suitable joint venture partners, and whether there are lists of poten-\ntial  partners  that  the  investors  can  choose  from. All  these  conditions  are  not  satisfactory\nin  Pakistan.\n\n(vii)\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe  availability,  reliability,  and  cost  of  infrastructure  facilities  (power,  telecommu-\nnications,  and  water  supplies)  are  important  ingredients  for  a  business  environment\nconducive to foreign investment. Pakistan compares unfavorably in infrastructure facilities\nwith  other  developing  countries  that  have  attracted  higher  levels  of  foreign  investment.\nPakistan has  only 18% of paved roads in good condition as against 50% in Thailand, 31%\nin  Philippines,  and  30%  in  Indonesia.  Pakistan\u2019s  extensive  but  poorly  managed  railway\n\n18Another example of slow implementation of policies concerning investment activity is that out of\n132  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOUs)  signed  during  the  previous  regime,  only  39  had  made  little\nprogress.\n\n\f19\n\nsystem does not make good for this disadvantage. Telecommunication is another bottleneck:\nthere  are  only  10  telephones  per  1,000  persons  in  Pakistan  compared  with  31  and  112  in\nThailand and Malaysia, respectively. Pakistan\u2019s amount of electricity produced per capita\nis higher than Indonesia\u2019s (435 kWh as against 233 kWh), but is only a fourth of Malaysia\u2019s\nand  one  half  of  Thailand.19  In  most  cases  the  urban  infrastructure  is  grossly  inadequate.\nOnly 50% of population have access to safe drinking water as against 81, 72, and 78% for\nPhilippines,  Thailand,  and  Malaysia,  respectively.20\n\nKarachi Port is six times more expensive than Dubai port (Jebal Ali), three times more\nexpensive than Colombo port, and twice as expensive as Bombay port. While other ports\noffer  goods  container  terminal  facilities,  Karachi  port  cannot  even  offer  priority  berthing\nfor  container  vessels.  There  are  frequent  delays  and  cancellations  of  berthing  and  sailing\ndue  to  obsolete  tugs  and  pilot  boats  at  Karachi  port.  Moreover,  due  to  the  lack  of  main-\ntenance the berths are unsafe. Karachi port cannot even provide proper container handling\nequipment and there is a shortage of space and bad planning, resulting in high cost to the\nconsignees. Large vessels cannot come to the port because of the lack of dredging of shipping\nchannels. Moreover, congestion in the hazardous cargo results in containers being detained\nlonger in the barge. All these have made Karachi port much more expensive than ports of\nneighboring countries (see Table 6 for itemwise costs at Karachi port and other ports of neigh-\nboring  countries).  Such  infrastructure  deficiencies  have  discouraged  the  flow  of  FDI  in\nPakistan.\n\nTABLE  6\nInternational  Comparison  of  Cost  Structure  of  Port  Handing\n(US$)\n\nKarachi\n\nColombo\n\nJebal  Ali\n\nBombay\n\nPilotage\n\nPort  Dues\n\nDockage\n\nTug  Hire\n\nChannel  Dues\n\nLine  Handlers\n\nEntering  Dues\n\nPilot  Fee\n\nPilot  Boat\n\nMooring  Launch\n\nTotal  Charges\n\n2100\n\n3220\n\n1120\n\n2238\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\n9\n\n135\n\n8822\n\n288.4\n\n1820.0\n\n210.0\n\n292.0\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\n288.4\n\n60.0\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\n436\n\nNil\n\n229\n\n640\n\nNil\n\n164\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\n1680\n\n1190\n\n1540\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nNil\n\nSource: Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Karachi.\n\n2958.8\n\n1469\n\n4410\n\n19Realizing the fact that Pakistan earlier faced severe deficiencies in power, a highly attractive power\nsector policy was announced in March 1994 with a view to attracting FDI in this sector. This is discussed in\nSection  IV.\n\n20All  the  information  pertaining  to  infrastructure  are  taken  from  the  World  Development  Report  1995\n(World  Bank  1995).  For  a  comprehensive  review  of  Pakistan\u2019s  infrastructure,  see  Kemal  and  Shabbir  (1995).\n\n\f20\n\n(viii )\n\nLabor Force\n\nA technically trained, educated, and disciplined labor force along with a country\u2019s\nlabor  laws  are  critical  factors  in  attracting  foreign  investors.  Pakistan  has  an  acute  short-\nage of technically trained and educated labor, especially in middle managerial positions and\nin engineering, which may have discouraged foreign investors. In particular, Pakistan is at\na  more  serious,  disadvantaged  position  in  terms  of  education  and  health  compared  with\nother developing countries that have attracted FDI at much higher levels. Pakistan\u2019s adult\nilliteracy  rate  is  62%  as  against  17%  for  Malaysia,  16%  for  Indonesia,  5%  for  Philippines,\nand 6% for Thailand. Only 80% of primary school age boys are enrolled in school (49% for\ngirls);  the  lowest  rate  for  the  four  reference  countries  is  93%  for  Malaysia.  Pakistan\u2019s  ex-\npenditure  on  education  accounts  for  only  1.1%  of  total  expenditure  as  against  10%  for\nIndonesia, 15.9% for Philippines, 21.1% for Thailand, and 20.3% for Malaysia (World Bank\n1997). It also has by far the worst indicators of public health among the five countries. With\nthe  general  level  of  education  and  health  care  being  low,  foreign  investors  may  not  find\nthe  workforce  they  need.\n\nBesides poor education and health indicators, Pakistan\u2019s labor laws are complicated\nand overprotective, discouraging job creation, inhibiting business expansion, and frightening\naway much needed productive investment. Such labor laws have created unnecessary la-\nbor disputes posing problems for management and causing productivity losses, which have\nalso discouraged foreign investment (Shirouzu 1993).21\n\n(ix)\n\nQuality of Life\n\nQuality of life along with cultural and social taboos is critical to attract foreign in-\nvestors. These factors are less conducive to foreign investors in Pakistan who are accustomed\nto  liberal  lifestyles.  This  is  in  fact,  one  of  the  largest  hidden  handicaps  Pakistan  possess\nagainst  NIEs  and ASEAN  countries  (Shirouzu  1993).  Foreign  investors  find  better  condi-\ntions in Indonesia and Malaysia (both Muslim countries) in the ASEAN region in terms of\nsocial  life  and  quality  of  life.\n\n(x)\n\nWelcoming Attitude\n\nHave immigration and customs officials at the airports and other entry points been\nfully  briefed  about  the  critical  role  they  play  in  investment  promotion  efforts?  Their  atti-\ntudes  play  an  important  role  in  foreign  investors\u2019  decision  making.  Although  the  high\ngovernment  officials  and  business  leaders  express  their  enthusiasm  in  inviting  foreign\ninvestment,  the  lack  of  a  cordial  environment  to  accommodate  foreigners  and  foreign  in-\nvestment prevails in Pakistan. The ancillary government agencies and officials seem to have\nan  indifferent  and  unsympathetic  attitude  toward  foreign  investors  (Shirouzu  1993).\n\nThe ten checkpoints discussed above constitute an investment environment and can\nbe classified into four factors, namely, cost, convenience, capability, and concessions. All these\nfactors  do  not  appear  to  be  so  favorable  as  in  East  and  Southeast Asian  economies.\n\n21See  also  the  letter  from  Secretary  General,  Overseas  Investors  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Indus-\ntry addressed to Shahid Javed Burki, Advisor to Prime Minister on Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs,\ndated  24  November  1996.\n\n\f21\n\nE. Economic Effects of FDI\n\nFDI  has  emerged  as  not  only  a  major  source  of  much  needed  capital  but  is  also\nconsidered to be a major channel for the access to advanced technologies and intangibles\nsuch as organizational and managerial skills, and marketing networks by developing coun-\ntries.  Globally,  FDI  has  grown  rapidly  in  recent  years,  faster  than  international  trade.\nDeveloped countries were the key force behind the record FDI flows but developing countries\nalso  experienced  a  spectacular  rise  in  the  flows,  reaching  as  high  as  $150  billion  in  1997.\nHow far have the inflows of FDI affected the level of economic activity in the host coun-\ntries?  This  question  has  been  extensively  investigated  in  recent  years.22\n\nThe inflow of FDI can \u201ccrowd in\u201d or \u201ccrowd out\u201d domestic investment and its ef-\nfect on saving is ambiguous. FDI has a positive overall effect on economic growth but the\nmagnitude of this effect depends on the stock of human capital available in the host economy.\nA  high  positive  correlation  between  aggregate  inflows  of  FDI  and  the  host  countries\u2019\naggregate  exports  has  been  found,  while  the  inflow  of  FDI  tends  to  increase  the  host\ncountry\u2019s  imports.23\n\nViews, however, diverge regarding the effect of FDI on balance of payments. Critics\nargue  that  while  the  initial  impact  of  an  inflow  of  FDI  on  the  host  country's  balance  of\npayments is positive, the medium-term impact is often negative, as the investors increase\nimports of intermediate goods and services and begin to repatriate profit. On the other hand,\nit is argued that the impact of FDI on the balance of payments depends on the exchange\nrate  regime.  Under  flexible  exchange  rates,  any  disturbance  to  the  balance  between  sup-\nply and demand for foreign exchange is corrected by a movement in the exchange rate. In\nthe case of a fixed exchange rate regime, a net increase in the demand for foreign exchange\nby  the  FDI  project  will  result  in  a  reduced  surplus  or  increased  deficit  in  the  balance  of\npayments. Empirical evidence suggests that an inflow of FDI has a bigger positive impact\non  host  country  exports  than  on  host  country  imports.  Hence,  the  balance  of  payments\nproblems,  if  they  do  occur,  are  likely  to  be  small  (WTO  1996).\n\nThe inflow of FDI in Pakistan is not only a recent phenomenon but it also does not\nform  a  high  percentage  of  GDP  or  domestic  fixed  investment. As  shown  in  Table  7,  FDI\nas percentage of GDP remained less than one percent until 1994/1995 but rose to 1.69% in\n1995/1996, due to large FDI in the power sector. FDI as a percentage of gross fixed invest-\nment averaged 3.5% during 1984/1985 to 1995/1996. Thus, given its low share in GDP and\nfixed investment, FDI is not expected to have a significant impact on various sectors of the\neconomy.\n\nWhat was the impact on Pakistan\u2019s imports and exports? First, most empirical research\nsuggests that inflow of FDI tends to increase the host country\u2019s imports. One reason is that\nMNCs  often  have  a  high  propensity  to  import  intermediate  inputs,  capital  goods,  and\nservices that are not readily available in the host countries.24 Some studies indicate that the\nimpact of FDI inflow on a host country\u2019s imports is either nil or that it slightly reduces the\nlevel of imports (Hill 1990). If FDI is concentrated in import substitution industries, then\nit is expected to affect imports negatively because the goods that were imported are now\n\n22See,  for  example,  Fry  (1996),  WTO  (1996),  and  Borensztein  et  al.  (1995).\n23See Lipsey and Weiss (1981, 1984); Hummels and Stern (1994); Graham and Anzai (1994); and Naujoks\n\n24See Graham and Krugman (1993), Graham and Anzai (1994), Hill (1990), and Naujoks and Schmidt\n\nand  Schmidt  (1995).\n\n(1995).\n\n\fproduced in the host country by foreign investors (Fry 1996). In order to examine the impact\nof  FDI  on  Pakistan\u2019s  imports,  we  tested  an  import  demand  function.25\n\n Results suggest that the inflow of FDI increases imports with a lag of one year. The\ncoefficient is statistically significant with a positive sign and suggests that a 10% increase\nin the inflow of FDI increases imports by 1.8 percent. Income elasticity of import demand\nis  less  than  unity  (0.8)  indicating  that  a  10%  increase  in  real  GDP  increases  imports  by\n8  percent.\n\nTABLE  7\nFDI  as  Percentage  of  GDP  and  Fixed  Investment\n\nFDI  as  Percentage  of\n\nFixed  Investment\n\n22\n\nGDP\n\n0.2  2\n0.45\n0.32\n0.42\n0.52\n0.54\n0.54\n0.69\n0.59\n0.68\n0.73\n1.69\n\n0.61\n\nYear\n\n1984/1985\n1985/1986\n1986/1987\n1987/1988\n1988/1989\n1989/1990\n1990/1991\n1991/1992\n1992/1993\n1993/1994\n1994/1995\n1995/1996\nAverage\n1984/1985-\n1995/1996\n\n1.37\n2.68\n1.85\n2.56\n3.03\n3.13\n3.10\n3.69\n3.10\n3.80\n4.25\n9.45\n\n3.50\n\nSource:  Government  of  Pakistan,  Economic  Survey  1996/97.\n\nSeveral studies have found a high positive correlation between the inflow of FDI and\nthe  host  countries\u2019  aggregate  exports.26  Evidence  based  on  sectoral  studies  indicates  that\nFDI is found often undertaken by companies that are already significant exporters (WTO\n1996). These findings are supported by studies that have found that foreign-owned firms\ntend  to  export  a  greater  proportion  of  their  output  than  do  their  locally  owned  counter-\nparts.27 Presumably foreign firms typically have a comparative advantage in their knowledge\nof  international  markets,  in  the  size  and  efficiency  of  their  distribution  networks,  and  in\ntheir  ability  to  respond  quickly  to  changing  patterns  of  demand  in  world  markets.\n\n25ln  M  =  1.60    +    0.80  ln  y    -    0.22  ln  (Pm/Pg)    +    0.18  ln  (FDI)-1\n                      (0.32)          (2.09)                  (0.69)                                      (1.96)\n            R2  =  0.92;    DW  =  2.73;      F  =  39.03;      SER  =  0.056;  t-values  in  parentheses\n\nWhere  M  is  real  demand  for  imports,  y  real  GDP,  and  Pm/Pg  relative  price  of  imports  (price  of  import  de-\nflated  by  GDP  deflator).\n\n26See for example, Hummels and Stein (1994), Wells (1993), Fry (1996), and Naujoks and Schmidt (1995).\n27See  Hill  (1990)  and  Noujoks  and  Schmidt  (1995).\n\n\f23\n\nThere  can  also  be  policy-based  linkages  between  FDI  and  host  country  exports.\nPerformance requirements that demand MNC affiliates to export a part of their production,\nand  FDI  incentives  that  are  limited  to  or  favor  export-oriented  sectors,  are  examples  of\npolicies that can produce or strengthen a positive correlation between inflows of FDI and\nexports. A classic example of such policies is export processing zones (EPZs). Many foreign\nfirms have established operations in these zones, which have been set up by the host country\ngovernment with the goal of stimulating exports, employment, skill upgrading, and tech-\nnology  transfer.\n\nWhat is the evidence in the case of Pakistan? What is the impact of FDI on Pakistan's\n\nexports?  To  answer  these  questions,  a  simplified  export  function  was  tested.28\n\nThe estimated coefficients of FDI (both contemporaneous and one year lag) are sta-\ntistically insignificant. This finding suggests that the inflow of FDI has largely been directed\ntoward  import-substitution  industries  or  production  for  the  domestic  market  while  little\nhas gone toward export-oriented industries. When these two set of results (both import and\nexport equations) are taken together, it appears that FDI has worsened the country\u2019s trade\nbalance. The inflow of FDI has tended to increase imports more than exports, suggesting\na deterioration in the trade balance. The income elasticity of exports is considerably higher\nthan unity, suggesting a one percent increase in real income increases exports by 1.38 percent.\nThe relative price of exports is unit-elastic, suggesting that a one percent increase in rela-\ntive  price  reduces  exports  by  one  percent.\n\nIV. Concentrated  FDI  in  the  Power  Sector\nand its Balance of Payments Implications\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf  it  is  not  the  \u201cengine  of  growth\u201d,  infrastructure  is  certainly  the  \u201cwheels\u201d  of  eco-\nnomic activity. Empirically a strong positive association exists between the availability of\ncertain infrastructure\u2014power, telecommunications, paved roads, and access to safe water\u2014\nand per capita GDP.29 The generally poor performance of state-owned monopolies, combined\nwith the rapid globalization of world economies, has brought into sharp focus the economic\ncosts  of  inadequate  infrastructure  and  has  prompted  a  growing  number  of  developing\ncountries to take active steps to promote competition, encourage the private sector including\nforeign investment in infrastructure. Between 1993 and 1995 the estimated private partici-\npation in infrastructure rose from $17 billion to $35 billion in developing countries (see IFC\n1996).\n\nIn  the  last  decade  and  a  half,  growth  of  population,  per  capita  income,  and  rapid\nurbanization  have  generated  a  great  deal  of  demand  for  transport,  power,  telecommuni-\ncations,  and  water  in  Pakistan.  The  supply  of  these  services,  on  the  other  hand,  has  not\nexpanded  sufficiently  fast  to  prevent  the  emergence  of  gross  shortage. Among  various\ninfrastructure constraints, power has emerged as the most serious bottleneck constraining\n\n28ln  X  =    -  3.24  +  1.38  ln  y    -    1.02  ln  (Pg/Px)    +    0.07  ln  (FDI)    +    0.06  ln  (FDI)-1\n\n(0.60)    (3.10)\n\n(3.23)\n\n(0.73)\n\n(0.58)\n\n                    R2  =  0.97;        DW  =  1.36;        F  =  102.7;        SER  =  0.07;  t-values  in  parentheses.\n\nWhere  X  is  real  export;  y  real  GDP;  P  export  price;  and  Pg  GDP  deflator.\n\n29For  empirical  evidence,  see  World  Development  Report  1994  (World  Bank  1994).\n\n\f24\n\nthe economy\u2019s long-term growth and development possibilities. The rationing of electric-\nity (load-shedding) to metropolitan and industrial areas has become a common feature in\nPakistan since the early 1980s and has given rise to social costs (the frustration of house-\nhold users) as well as economic costs in terms of lost manufacturing output. The Task Force\non Energy (1994) noted the loss of industrial output due to load shedding in the neighbor-\nhood of Rs 12 billion. Stone (1995), in a survey of 200 industrial enterprises in Pakistan found\nthat these firms lost an average of 21 workdays a year to electric power shortages alone.30\nRemoving Pakistan\u2019s power shortages required a large amount of capital and strong\nincentives that were beyond the resources and institutional capabilities of the public sector.\nFrom 1994 to 1996, efforts to rectify power shortages were focused on encouraging domestic\nand foreign private investors to participate in the generation of electricity. The policy was\nhighly welcomed by foreign investors, mostly from the US and the UK. Two to three years\nafter  the  initiation  of  the  policy,  there  are  now  serious  apprehensions  about  overcapacity\nand  balance  of  payments  implications.\n\nB.\n\nState  of  the  Power  Sector  up  to  the  Mid-1990s\n\nElectricity  consumption  in  Pakistan  has  grown  at  a  faster  rate  than  real  GDP.  The\naverage annual growth rate of electricity consumption from 1980/1981 to 1994/1995 was\n9.3% against 5.7% growth of real GDP (an elasticity of 1.6). In spite of rapid growth in elec-\ntricity consumption, Pakistan\u2019s per capita consumption of electricity is far less than many\nother developing countries. In 1995 per capita consumption of electricity in Pakistan was\n340 kWh against the PRC (448 kWh), Thailand (636 kWh), Iran (724 kWh), Malaysia (1146\nkWh),  and Asia  on  average  (1235  kWh)  (Ansari  1996).  Pakistan\u2019s  generation  capacity  of\n7  KW  per  100  population  is  less  than  the  corresponding  figures  of  7.5  KW  in  Sri  Lanka,\n9 KW in India, and 12 KW in PRC. At the same time, power system losses of 24% in Pakistan\nare far above the 18% in Sri Lanka, 19% in India, 15% in PRC, and 20% or less in the case\nof Chile, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya,  Malaysia, Morocco, Thailand, and Turkey (Esfahani 1995).\nElectricity  in  Pakistan  is  supplied  by  vertically  integrated  public  utilities,  namely\nWater  &  Power  Development Authority  (WAPDA)  and  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corpora-\ntion (KESC), which are responsible for generation, transmission, and eventual distribution\nto end-users. WAPDA with a franchise area of about 770,000 sq. km., and an electricity con-\nsumption density of 45.5 kWh per sq. km. (1994/1995) serves a large decentralized power\ndistribution  operation  through  area  electricity  boards.  KESC  on  the  other  hand,  with  a\nfranchise area of about 6024 sq. km. and an electricity consumption density of 935 kWh per\nsq. km. (1994/1995) serves basically the Karachi Division, part of Thatta District in Sindh,\nand Uthal, Bela and other parts of Baluchistan (Ansari 1996). Apart from WAPDA and KESC,\nthe Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) also operates a 137 MW Nuclear Power\nStation near Karachi. There are also few captive power plants in the country, with an ap-\nproximate  installed  capacity  of  237  MW  (Manzoor  1996).\n\n30This  survey  was  carried  out  under  a  private  sector  assessment  study  by  the  World  Bank  on  the\ninfrastructural  bottlenecks  in  Pakistan.  On  the  scale  of  1  to  5  indicating  the  severity  of  obstacles  to  their\noperations  and  growth,  the  surveyed  firms  on  average  ranked  infrastructure  constraints  as  3.4,  after  politi-\ncal and economic instability. Among infrastructure constraints, Pakistani enterprises ranked power breakdowns\n(4.2), voltage fluctuations (3.8), road quality (3.6), and telecommunications (2.8) as their most important problems\n(see  Stone  1995).\n\n\f25\n\nOut of total electricity generated in the country in 1995/1996, WAPDA was respon-\nsible for 86% of generation while KESC maintained a share of 13%, and the remaining one\npercent came from PAEC and captive power plants. There are three primary modes of power\ngeneration in Pakistan, namely, hydel, thermal, and nuclear. Among these modes, thermal\naccounts for 62% while hydel and nuclear account for 37% and 1%, respectively. The cur-\nrent installed generation capacity as of January 1996 in Pakistan adds up to 12988 MW; of\nthis,  hydel  capacity  represents  4825  MW,  thermal  capacity  represents  8026  MW,  and  the\nbalance is nuclear capacity of 137 MW. Meanwhile, WAPDA\u2019s generation capacity stood at\n11113  MW.  The  KESC  capacity  totaled  1738  MW,  137  MW  of  which  was  nuclear.\n\nUntil the 1970s, the industrial sector was the largest consumer of electricity, accounting\nfor more than 50% of total electricity consumption. Rural electrification programs combined\nwith rising income levels encouraged people to use electrical appliances in the home, which\nwere translated into a higher growth rate of electricity consumption by the domestic sector.\nIn  fact,  percentage  share  of  electricity  consumption  by  the  domestic  sector  has  increased\ndramatically from 32.4% in 1990/1991 to 40.5% in 1995/1996. On the other hand, the elec-\ntricity consumption by the industrial sector declined equally sharply from 34.3% to 28.9%\nduring  the  same  period  (see  Table  8).\n\nTABLE  8\nElectricity  Consumption  by  Economic  Group\n(percent)\n\nElectricity  Consumption  as    Percent  of  Total\n\nEconomic  Groups\n\n1990/91\n\n1991/92\n\n1992/93\n\n1993/94\n\n1994/95\n\n1995/96\n\nDomestic\n\nCommercial\n\nIndustrial\n\nAgricultural\n\nBulk  Buyers\n\nPublic  Light\n\n32.4\n\n4.3\n\n34.3\n\n21.7\n\n7.8\n\n0.1\n\n33.1\n\n4.1\n\n34.9\n\n19.9\n\n7.9\n\n0.1\n\n35.9\n\n4.2\n\n34.9\n\n17.9\n\n7.1\n\n0.1\n\n37.2\n\n4.1\n\n32.8\n\n17.9\n\n7.9\n\n0.1\n\n38.4\n\n4.2\n\n30.3\n\n17.7\n\n9.3\n\n0.1\n\n40.5\n\n4.7\n\n28.9\n\n18.4\n\n7.5\n\n0.1\n\nSource: ABN  AMRO  Bank,  Economic  Bulletin  (1996).\n\nBesides rural electrification and rising income levels, the tariff structure may have\ninfluenced the electricity consumption by various economic groups. Table 9 documents such\ninformation. The existing tariff structure subsidizes domestic households and the agricul-\ntural  sector  at  the  expense  of  commercial  and  industrial  users.\n\n\f26\n\nTABLE    9\nCross-subsidization  of  Tariffs\n\nConsumption\nas    Percent    of  Total\n\nShare  of  Billing\n  (percent)\n\nPrice  per  unit\n    (Rs/KWH)\n\nEconomic  Groups\n\n1993/94\n\n1994/95\n\n1993/94\n\n1994/95\n\n1993/94\n\n1994/95\n\nResidential\n\nCommercial\n\nIndustrial\nAgricultural\n\n37.2\n\n4.1\n\n32.8\n17.9\n\n38.4\n\n4.2\n\n30.3\n17.7\n\n27.1\n\n11.3\n\n43.9\n8.8\n\n28.8\n\n11.9\n\n40.8\n8.8\n\n0.6154\n\n2.3166\n\n1.1292\n0.4200\n\n0.6339\n\n2.3373\n\n1.1376\n0.4199\n\nSource: ABN  AMRO  Bank,  Economic  Bulletin  (1996).\n\nIn fact, the commercial sector pays more than 5 times higher per unit of electricity\n\nand  industry  pays  2.7  times  higher  per  unit  as  compared  with  the  agricultural  sector.\n\nC. Demand\u2013Supply Situation\n\nElectricity  demand  in  Pakistan  over  the  past  30  years  has  been  driven  by  increas-\ning rates of urbanization, sustained economic growth and rising income levels, and to some\ndegree by a tariff structure that has generally subsidized household consumers over industrial\nand commercial consumers. Table 10 reports the growth in demand for electricity by various\neconomic groups. Over the past decade electricity consumption by households grew at an\naverage rate of almost 12% per annum followed by agriculture (7.8%), industry (7.3%), and\ncommercial (6.4%). As against the second half of the 1980s, in the 1990s the growth in elec-\ntricity consumption has slowed down considerably across all economic groups in general\nbut  agriculture  and  industry  in  particular.  Decline  in  industrial  and  agricultural  produc-\ntion  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  along  with  tariff  adjustment  have  been  instrumental  in\nreducing electricity demand in these two sectors. The relatively higher growth rate exhibited\nby domestic consumers is partly due to 410,000 new connections provided by WAPDA in\n1994,  88%  of  which  was  in  the  residential  sector.  The  growth  in  demand  for  electricity\noutstripped the growth in the number of consumers in all sectors, implying an increase in\nthe  intensity  in  power  use  by  consumers  (about  5%  in  the  1990s)  (Manzoor  1996).\n\nTABLE    10\nGrowth  in  the  Electricity  Demand  by  Various  Economic  Groups\n(percent)\n\nEconomic  Groups\n\n1985/86  to  1989/90\n\n1990/91  to  1994/95\n\n1985/86  to  1994/95\n\nDomestic\n\nCommercial\n\nIndustrial\n\nAgricultural\n\n13.1\n\n6.8\n\n10.6\n\n11.1\n\nSource: The Government of Pakistan, Islamabad.\n\n10.8\n\n6.0\n\n4.1\n\n4.6\n\n11.9\n\n6.4\n\n7.3\n\n7.8\n\n\f27\n\nIn 1994/1995, the National Power Plan (NPP) made projections of the future demand\nfor  electricity  for  the  period  up  to  the  year  2008.  In  so  doing,  it  generated  three  alterna-\ntive scenarios by taking into account the expected economic growth, technological changes\nand changes in lifestyle that collectively influence the future power requirements. The three\nforecasts under alternative scenarios, namely, Reference Forecast (High Forecast), NPP Base\nForecast (Medium Forecast), and NPP Forecast with Demand Side Management (DSM) (low\nforecast)  are  documented  in  Table  11.\n\nUnder  the  Reference  Forecast,  electricity  demand  (in  MW)  is  projected  to  grow  at\nan average annual rate of 8.8% (taking 1993/1994 as the base year) until the end of the 10th\nFive-Year  Plan  period,  i.e.,  2008.  The  NPP  with  DSM  tries  to  incorporate  the  price  effect\nwhereby  tariff  increases  will  reduce  the  growth  of  energy  demand.  In  the  year  2000,  the\nNPP Base forecast for peak demand is 13628 MW, about 10% lower than the peak demand\nunder Reference Forecast. Similarly, the NPP forecast with DSM in the Year 2000 is 12632\nMW, which is 16.5% lower than the Reference forecast. By the Year 2008 the peak demand\nunder NPP Base forecast and with DSM are 22% and 33% lower than the Reference forecast.\nThe power supply situation was not likely to match the growing demand. The in-\nstalled capacity during the last one decade increased from 6298 MW in 1985/1986 to 12100\nMW  in  1994/1995  and  by  January  1996  it  was  increased  to  12988  MW. As  against  an  an-\nnual average increase in demand of 8.4%, installed capacity grew by an average rate of 8.1%\nduring the last one decade. Since installed capacity refers to maximum generation capac-\nity,  the  actual  supply  is  far  less.\n\nTABLE    11\nNational  Power  Plan  (NPP)  Peak  Demand  Projections\nunder  Alternative  Scenarios\n(megawatts)\n\nReference  Forecast\n\nNPP  Base  Forecast\n\nNPP  Forecast  with  DSM1\n\nYear\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\nAverage  Growth\n\n1Demand Side Management.\nSource: National  Power  Plan  Update  1994-95.\n\n9127\n\n9930\n\n10804\n\n11755\n\n12789\n\n13915\n\n15139\n\n16471\n\n17921\n\n19498\n\n21214\n\n23081\n\n25112\n\n27321\n\n29726\n8.8%\n\n9178\n\n9754\n\n10371\n\n11028\n\n11747\n\n12681\n\n13628\n\n14649\n\n15778\n\n16932\n\n18047\n\n19234\n\n20434\n\n21709\n\n23127\n6.8%\n\n9178\n\n9754\n\n10178\n\n10647\n\n11177\n\n11906\n\n12632\n\n13423\n\n14307\n\n15201\n\n16041\n\n16948\n\n17856\n\n18831\n\n19929\n5.7%\n\n\f28\n\nWAPDAs  line  losses  have  been  estimated  at  24%  of  generation.  Since  WAPDA\u2019s\naverage utilization is 49% of installed capacity, this implies that for each MW of installed\ncapacity, only 0.4 MW is actually supplied. KESC line losses are even larger (at 32%), which\nimplies that only 0.37 MW can be supplied for each MW of installed capacity (see Naqvi\n1996). Therefore, a large demand-supply gap under two alternative scenarios was expected.\nThe  peak  load  demand-supply  gap  was  estimated  between  500  MW  to  700  MW  for  1995\nwhich  was  projected  to  increase  in  the  range  of  3000-4500  MW  by  the  year  2000.\n\nD. Salient  Features  of  the  1994  Power  Policy\n\nSince Pakistan\u2019s government was not in a position to undertake such a gigantic power\nproject  to  minimize  the  gap,  efforts  to  rectify  these  shortages  were  focused  on  encourag-\ning the private sector (both domestic and foreigners) into power generation. Such a large\ngap  in  demand  and  supply,  along  with  outdated  transmission  and  distribution  networks\nand poor maintenance of plants and equipment could have wreaked havoc with household\nconsumers and industries.\n\nIn order to attract the private sector into power generation, a highly lucrative and\ninternationally competitive private power policy was formulated by the GOP in March 1994.\nThe  salient  features  of  the  1994  Power  Policy  are:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\nInvestors are free to choose the site and opt for the fuel type and technology\nsubject  to  certain  restrictions.\n\nThe GOP provides a guaranteed market for the power supplied by the private\nsector that the power will be purchased by WAPDA/KESC under a long-term\ncontract  covering  a  period  between  15  to  30  years.\n\nIn case the fuel is to be supplied by a public sector organization  (PSO), the\nperformance of the fuel supplier (mostly PSO) will be guaranteed by the gov-\nernment  under  the  terms  of  Fuel  Supply Agreement.\n\nThe government also provides protection against changes in certain taxes and\nduties and ensures the convertibility of foreign exchange to cover the necessary\nexpenses  of  the  project.\n\n(v)\n\nThere are exemptions from import duties and sales taxes on plant and equip-\nment.\n\n(vi)\n\nParticipation  of  local  partners  to  set  up  power  projects  is  not  mandatory.\n\nThe bulk power tariff rate will be 6.5 cents per kWh for the first 10 years and\nthe  legalized  tariff  for  the  life  of  the  project  is  5.9  cents  per  kWh.\n\nThe government has established a Private Sector Energy Development Fund\nwith the assistance of the World Bank, USAID, and other multilateral lend-\ning  agencies  to  provide  up  to  40%  of  the  capital  costs  of  the  project,  which\nis allowed to issue bonds and shares at discounted prices.\n\n\f29\n\n(ix)\n\nThe dollar indexed tariff structure is divided into two components, namely,\nthe capacity price (fixed costs of debt servicing, returns to equity, maintenance,\ninsurance,  and  administrative  costs)  and  the  energy  price.\n\n(x)\n\nRepatriation  of  equity  along  with  dividends  is  allowed  freely.\n\n(xi)\n\nForeign exchange risk insurance is available from the State Bank of Pakistan\non  foreign  currency  loans.\n\nThe international response to Pakistan\u2019s new private power policy has been almost\noverwhelming.  The  government  has  attracted  34  letters  of  support  totaling  8306  MW  of\nindependent power producers (IPPs) (see Table 12), and nearly 19 have so far reached actual\nfinancial close. It was expected that nearly 3000 MW of additional capacity would be added\nwith an investment of roughly $3 billion. With additional supply of private power, the revised\ndemand\u2013supply gap under two alternative scenarios for the period up to year 2000 is re-\nported in Table 13. Additional supplies would come from two sources, namely, captive power\nand private power.31 The demand\u2013supply gap under Reference Forecast (Gap I), indicates\na surplus of 679 MW in 1997 as some 3111 MW (237 MW from captive power and 2874 MW\nfrom  private  power)  is  expected  to  be  on  line.  Thus,  an  addition  of  2800  MW  of  derated\ncapacity is likely to increase the total supply to 12434 MW by 1997 resulting into a surplus\nof 679 MW. But this surplus was expected to quickly turn into a shortage, rising up to 1589\nMW  by  the  year  2000.\n\nTABLE  12\nGeneral  Status  of  the  IPP  Projects\n\nEst.

It suggests a surplus of 1406 MW in 1997 but this surplus gradually declines\nand  finally  turns  into  shortage  by  the  year  2000.\n\nHaving attracted this magnitude of investment, it can be argued even at this early\nstage that the power initiative has been successful in meeting its goals. However, the power\npolicy has also invited considerable criticism. The generosity of the policy, the resultant cost\nthe consumer will have to bear, and its impact on the country\u2019s balance of payments have\nbeen singled out for severe criticism. Another major concern was that if the projects issued\nletters of support under the policy that came through, it could result in system overcapacity\nand the scheduled payments to the private power companies would threaten the liquidity\nposition  of  both  WAPDA  and  KESC.\n\nRealizing the fact that the government issued too many letters of support, the new\npower policy came under review by the government. On 3 March 1996 the Economic Co-\nordination  Committee  of  the  Cabinet  set  a  3000  MW  limit  for  private  power  projects,\nincluding those for which letters of support had already been issued. It was a retreat to the\n1994 power policy. However, WAPDA and KESC could not afford the purchase of the supply\nof IPPs due to their poor liquidity position and depressed demand for electricity under eco-\nnomic  stagnation.\n\nE. Balance  of  Payments  Implications\n\nOne of the central criticisms concerning the new power policy has been the issuance\nof  far  too  many  letters  of  support  for  private  power  projects  and  the  resultant  recurring\nannual foreign exchange cost to cover fixed and variable foreign currency expenses. Such\na recurring nature of foreign exchange cost will have serious implications for the country\u2019s\nbalance of payments. The key cash outflows in terms of foreign exchange are debt repay-\nments, dividend payments, and fuel payments. Table 14 contains the estimated impact on\nthe country\u2019s balance of payments. Pakistan is likely to experience a recurring foreign cur-\nrency liability of $900 million to close to $1.0 billion per annum over the next 14 years. If\n1292  MW  of  Hub  Power  Company  is  also  taken  into  account,  then  the  recurring  foreign\ncurrency liability increases to $1.3-1.4 billion per annum. These estimated balance of pay-\nments  implications  are  very  close  to  the  ones  estimated  by  Citibank  (1996), ABN AMRO\nBank (1996) and Naqvi (1996). The amount is significant in view of the country\u2019s present\nlevel  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  of  $1.2-1.3  billion.\n\nTABLE  14\nEstimated  Impact  on  the  Balance  of  Payments\n(million  US$)\n\nYear\n\nDebt  Payments\n\nDividend  Payments\n\nFuel  Payments\n\nTotal  BOP  Impact\n\n1996/97\n\n1997/98\n\n1998/99\n\n1999/2000\n\n360\n\n360\n\n530\n\n500\n\n0\n\n108\n\n108\n\n108\n\n122.5\n\n260.2\n\n328.4\n\n344.9\n\n482.5\n\n728.2\n\n966.4\n\n952.9\n\nContinued  next  page\n\n\fTABLE  14  (cont\u2019d.)\n\nYear\n\nDebt  Payments\n\nDividend  Payments\n\nFuel  Payments\n\nTotal  BOP  Impact\n\n32\n\n108\n\n108\n\n108\n\n108\n\n108\n\n108\n\n108\n\n108\n\n108\n108\n\n2000/2001\n\n2001/2002\n\n2002/2003\n\n2003/2004\n\n2004/2005\n\n2005/2006\n\n2006/2007\n\n2007/2008\n\n2008/2009\n2009/2010\n\n470\n\n440\n\n410\n\n380\n\n350\n\n320\n\n290\n\n260\n\n230\n200\n\nNote:  The following  information was used in calculation:\n\ni. 80:20 debt-equity ratio\nii.

Conclusions,  Lessons,  and  Policy  Challenges\n\nA. Conclusions  and  Lessons  Learned\n\nForeign direct investment is now perceived in many developing countries as a key\nsource of much needed capital, foreign advanced technology, and managerial skills. Real-\nizing its central importance to economic development, these developing countries have taken\nwide-ranging steps to liberalize their inward FDI regime and have succeeded in attracting\nsubstantial amount of FDI. Within a span of seven years (1990-1997), the inflow of FDI rose\nfrom $34 billion to $150 billion, accounting for 37% of world FDI. Before the financial crisis,\nthe Asian countries emerged as the largest FDI recipients with an estimated $87 billion of\ninflows in 1997, with East and Southeast Asian countries accounting for more than 90 percent.\nSouth Asian countries, however, lagged behind considerably compared with their other fellow\nAsian  countries.  Pakistan  stands  nowhere  close  to  many  other Asian  countries  in  attract-\ning  FDI.\n\nAnother major problem facing Pakistan is massive FDI on the power sector following\nthe 1994 power policy. It has invited considerable criticism based on its serious balance of\npayments implications. The new power policy has resulted in an overcapacity in the power\nsector under subsequent industrial stagnation. Massive inflows of FDI also gave rise to a\nhuge  amount  of  recurring  foreign  exchange  cost  to  cover  fixed  and  variable  foreign  cur-\nrency  expenses.  Further,  it  involves  the  problem  of  large  cash  outflows  by  IPPs  for  debt\nrepayments, dividend payments, and fuel payments. With terms and conditions stated in\nthe power policy and the various assumptions made in calculating the balance of payments\nimplications, Pakistan is likely to experience a recurring foreign currency liability of $900\n\n\f33\n\nmillion  minimum  to  $1.4  billion  maximum  per  annum  over  the  next  14  years.32  This  is  a\nlarge  amount  given  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves  of  $1.2-1.3  billion  at  present.\nImportant  policy  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  Pakistan's  experience  for  other  developing\ncountries. First, FDI is not necessarily beneficial to developing countries in the short term\nif  an  improper  FDI  policy  is  implemented.  Second,  developing  economies  should  accord\ntheir short-term priority to inviting FDI to the foreign-exchange-earning sector, or at least,\nboth  the  foreign-exchange-earning  sector  and  other  sectors  simultaneously.  International\ndevelopment organizations, including the Asian Development Bank, must consider this need\nin their operations particularly build-own-transfer type operations that involve the partici-\npation  of  foreign  private  investors.\n\nB. Policy Recommendations\n\n(i)\n\nGeneral Recommendations\n\nFirst of all, Pakistan should make stronger efforts to attract as much FDI as possible\nto the foreign exchange sectors in the short term. Taking into account unfavorable balance\nof  payments  prospects,  it  should  refrain  from  attracting  any  further  massive  FDI  in  the\nnonforeign-exchange-earning  sectors  for  some  years  in  the  future.  Political  stability  and\nsatisfactory  law  and  order  are  likewise  critical  to  attract  FDI.\n\nThe international press and media coverage Pakistan has received in recent years is\nnot  at  all  conducive  to  attracting  foreign  investors.  News  items  on  Pakistan  being  one  of\nthe  most  corrupt  countries  in  the  world,  its  bomb  detonations,  and  its  use  of  child  labor\nwill hardly encourage foreign investors to undertake initiatives in Pakistan. The country\u2019s\npolitical leadership must take practical steps to improve the law and order situation par-\nticularly  in  the  major  \u201cgrowth  poles\u201d  of  the  country  including  Karachi.  Macroeconomic\nstability  plays  a  key  role  in  boosting  economic  growth  (see  Kim  1993)  and  restoring  for-\neign  investors\u2019  confidence  on  the  economy.  In  an  environment  of  large  fiscal  deficit  and\nprecarious foreign exchange reserves position, foreign investors are unlikely to increase their\nparticipation. Pakistan\u2019s fiscal situation and foreign exchange reserves position will remain\nunder considerable strain for some time making the macroeconomic environment less con-\nducive for foreign investors. Some drastic and far-reaching measures are needed to reduce\nthe fiscal deficit on the one hand and raise foreign exchange reserves on the other. Incon-\nsistent economic policies discourage foreign investors in undertaking projects of medium\nto long-run duration. Several recent examples of inconsistent economic policies pursued by\nPakistan  have  sent  wrong  signals  to  foreign  investors.\n\nThere is a strong perception among foreign investors that the probusiness policies\nand inducements used to attract prospective new investors are somehow lost in the real-\nity they encounter when they actually begin to set up and operate their business in Pakistan.\nAlthough the investment approval requirement has been removed, numerous permits and\nclearances from different government agencies at national, regional, and local levels are still\n\n32To  mitigate  this  problem,  the  GOP  has  recently  revised  its  contracts  with  IPPs  in  order  to  reduce\nthe price to purchase the electricity supply of IPPs, which has caused serious international criticism, undermined\ninvestors\u2019 confidence, and resulted in many legal conflicts between the GOP and IPPs. The GOP has also made\nan attempt, with the assistance of the Bank, to export electricity to India but it has not been successful until\nnow.\n\n\f34\n\napplied to foreign investors, causing delays to complete the process. The authorities should\nstreamline  administrative  procedures  regarding  approval  and  official  clearances.  Foreign\ninvestors in Pakistan have to cope with a complex legal situation. Law based on different\nlegal  systems  are  applied  independently  and  it  is  often  not  obvious  which  one  will  take\nprecedence.  The  legal  situation  is  even  further  complicated  by  the  fact  that  government\nagencies  are  empowered  to  introduce  certain  changes  through  administrative  orders  and\nSROs.  The  laws  and  regulations  should  be  simplified,  updated,  modernized,  made  more\ntransparent,  and  their  discretionary  application  must  be  discouraged.\n\n(ii)\n\nSpecific Recommendations\n\nTaxes\n\nPayment  of  taxes  and  contributions  in  Pakistan  is  complex  and  cumbersome.  In\naddition to corporate income taxes, a large number of indirect taxes are levied at the federal,\nprovincial, and local levels. Essentially, separate collection of taxes and contributions have\nforced enterprises to face unnecessary, cumbersome, and costly administrative procedures,\nand  to  deal  with  a  large  number  of  collecting  agencies  at  all  three  levels  of  government.\nThere  is  an  urgent  need  to  reduce  the  number  of  taxes  and  contributions;  streamline  tax\nregulations  and  administrative  procedures;  and  most  importantly  reduce  the  contact  of\nforeign firms with a large number of tax and contributions-collecting agencies. The exist-\nence of such a large number of taxes and collecting agencies may breed corruption, which\nadds to the cost of production. Import tariffs on plant and machinery have discouraged in-\nvestment, more so in Pakistan where capital is scarce and cost of borrowing is high. Because\nof  this  high  cost,  manufacturers  are  discouraged  to  modernize  and  the  quality  of  local\nindustry  products  are  restricted  against  international  competition.  There  is  a  need  to  ex-\namine  tariffs  of  plant  and  machinery  with  a  view  to  substantially  reducing  them.\n\nCredit  Facilities\n\nForeign firms operating in Pakistan are currently facing cash flow problems as a result\nof many taxes and the Asian crisis. That these firms cannot borrow more than their equity\ncapital have further aggravated the cash flow problem. There is a need to review this policy.\n\nAnti-monopoly Restrictions\n\nThe existing monopoly control laws that benchmark the concentration of economic\npower to an unrealistically low limit of Rs 300 million for assets discourage capital formation.\nThe  monopoly  control  authority  must  review  the  limit  in  consultation  with  the  Overseas\nInvestors  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  in  Pakistan.\n\nLabor  Laws\n\nOverprotective labor laws do not encourage productivity and frighten away much\nneeded productive investment. There is a need to rationalize the labor laws and multiple\nlevies  on  employment  that  inhibit  business  expansion  and  job  creation.\n\n\f35\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe availability of better quality and more reliable services in all areas of infrastructure\nare  key  ingredients  of  a  business  environment  conducive  to  foreign  investment.  In  most\ninfrastructure  services,  Pakistan  is  highly  deficient  as  compared  with  many  developing\ncountries that have attracted higher levels of foreign investment. If Pakistan wants to catch\nup  gradually  with  the  development  of  the  economies  of  East  and  Southeast Asia,  it  will\nhave  to  investment  more  in  the  areas  of  education  and  physical  infrastructure.  On  the\neducation  front,  the  government  should  identify  the  nature  of  skills  critical  to  sustained\nindustrial growth, and formulate strategies, policies, and programs that could facilitate the\nenhancement  of  these  skills.\n\nIn telecoms, the government should expedite the privatization  of PTC. In the railway\nand road sector, government must engage the private sector in leases, concessions, and build-\noperate-transfer  (BOT)  type  contracts.  The  high  cargo  handling  costs  at  the  Karachi  port\nneed to be controlled. Dredging of shipping channels to accommodate large vessels, low-\nering  labor  costs,  upgrading  port  handling  equipment,  and  improving  documentary\nprocedures  need  urgent  attention.\n\n Confidence-building Measure\n\nThe  close  partnership  between  the  private  and  public  sector  is  essential  to  build\nconfidence. In this respect, it is recommended that a forum be established where the pri-\nvate and public sectors could sit together to discuss business promotion-related issues. The\nforum  must  be  composed  of  the  prime  minister,  all  the  presidents  of  the  national  cham-\nbers, top businessmen/industrialists, top bankers, as well as heads of overseas chambers\nof commerce and relevant ministries' secretaries and ministers. The forum may meet regularly\nto review the economic situation of the country. The problem faced by the business com-\nmunity can be discussed and decisions could be taken immediately. This kind of partnership\nbetween  the  government  and  private  sector  will  help  restore  market  confidence.\n\n\f36\n\n  APPENDIX\nInternational  Flows  of  Foreign  Direct  Investment\u2014A  Comparison1\n(billion  $)\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\nTotal  Inflows2\n\n204.2\n\n(100.0)\n\n175.8\n\n(100.0)\n\n243.0\n\n(1000.0)\n\n331.2\n\n(100.0)\n\n334.6\n\n(100.0)\n\n400.5\n\n(100.0)\n\nDeveloped  Countries\n\nDeveloping  Countries\n\nAsia\n\nPRC\n\nSouth  Asia\n\nPakistan\n\n170.3\n\n(83.3)\n\n33.7\n\n(16.5)\n\n22.1\n\n(10.8)\n\n3.5\n\n(1.7)\n\n0.46\n\n(0.2)\n\n0.24\n\n(0.1)\n\n120.3\n\n(68.4)\n\n51.1\n\n(29.1)\n\n29.7\n\n(16.9)\n\n11.2\n\n(6.4)\n\n0.62\n\n(0.4)\n\n0.34\n\n(0.2)\n\n141.5\n\n(58.2)\n\n95.6\n\n(29.3)\n\n60.7\n\n(25.0)\n\n33.8\n\n(13.9)\n\n1.23\n\n(0.5)\n\n0.42\n\n(0.2)\n\n211.5\n\n(63.9)\n\n105.5\n\n(31.9)\n\n67.4\n\n(20.4)\n\n35.8\n\n(10.8)\n\n2.73\n\n(0.8)\n\n0.72\n\n(0.2)\n\n195.4\n\n(59.9)\n\n129.8\n\n(38.4)\n\n80.0\n\n(23.7)\n\n40.8\n\n(12.1)\n\n3.29\n\n(1.0)\n\n0.77\n\n(0.2)\n\n233.1\n\n(58.2)\n\n148.9\n\n(37.2)\n\n86.9\n\n(21.7)\n\n45.3\n\n(11.3)\n\n4.35\n\n(1.1)\n\n0.8\n\n(0.2)\n\n1Figures in parentheses are the shares in total.\n2Total inflows are not necessarily equal to the sum of developed and developing countries due to errors and omissions.\nSource: UNCTAD (1998).\n\n\f37\n\nReferences\n\nSupply  Corporation,    Karachi.\n\ntariat,  Government  of  Pakistan.\n\nPakistan.\n\nABN AMRO  Bank,  1996.  \u201cPrivate  Power  in  Pakistan.\u201d  Economic  Bulletin  2(9).\nAnsari, A.
