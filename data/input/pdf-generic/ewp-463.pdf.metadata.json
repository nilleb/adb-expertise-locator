The paper highlights \n\nthree findings. First, although total lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) grew slightly, \n\nMSME loan shares declined drastically from 30% in 2002 to 16.4% in 2010. Second, there was a sharp rise \n\nin noncompliance after loan targets increased in 2008. Third, there is increased heterogeneity in optimal \n\nloan portfolio across banks. Most surprisingly, total MSME lending by rural and cooperative banks declined \n\nsince 2008. Abolishing Magna Carta target for medium-sized enterprise loans would most likely yield little \n\nadverse\u00a0effects.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty.

The final sample of 109 financial institutions represented over 90% of total \nfinance sector assets in the Philippines. We highlight three important findings.  First, although the total \nlending levels to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) grew slightly, the percentage shares of \nloans allocated to MSMEs declined drastically from a peak of 30% of total loans in 2002 to 16.4% in \n2010. Second, following the upwards revision of the loan target (from 6% to 8%) for smaller firms in \n2008,  there  was  a  sharp  increase  in  noncompliance  especially  amongst  universal  and  commercial \nbanks. Kernel density estimates suggest that the revision of the Magna Carta in 2008 was binding for \nsmall firm lending particularly for the universal and commercial banks. On the other hand, total loans \nto  medium  enterprises  were  still  more  than  threefold  larger  than  the  targeted  2%.  Third,  there  is  an \nincreased heterogeneity in optimal loan portfolio across banks. Most surprisingly, the absolute level of \nMSME  lending  by  rural  and  cooperative  banks  declined  since  2008.  Direct  compliance  amongst \nuniversal  and  commercial  banks  decreased  beginning  in  the  late  2007,  while  that  of  thrift  banks \nincreased  to  almost  100%.  Abolishing  the  Magna  Carta  targets  for  medium-sized  enterprise  loans \nwould most likely yield little adverse effects. Meanwhile, efforts to improve financial access to MSMEs \nshould  focus  on  alternative  nondistortionary  ways  to  increase  financing  supply,  such  as  improving \ninstitutional framework for informational availability and development of equity and bond markets for \nMSMEs. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: financial inclusion, financial markets, financial policy, Philippines, SME, targeted lending \n \nJEL Classification: G21, G28, O16 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nMicro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is the lifeblood of most economies. A vibrant MSME \nsector is essential in spreading the economy\u2019s wealth and income flows, creating more opportunities in \nthe countryside, maintaining social stability, and fostering inclusive economic growth. In this context, \naccess  to  finance  is  central  to  MSME  development.  Availability  and  cost  of  funds  determine  firms\u2019 \nability  to  compete  for  market  share,  innovate,  expand  and  withstand  business-related  stresses. \nHowever,  since  financial  markets  in  most  developing  economies  are  largely  underdeveloped  with  far \nfrom ideal regulatory frameworks, many governments in developing Asia have designed medium and \nlong-term MSME development plans, with the main goal of improving financing for MSMEs. \n \n\nIn the Philippines, one of the most important inclusive financing policies is the mandated credit \nprogram  known  as  the  MSME  Magna  Carta  (Magna  Carta)  to  improve  financial  access  to  MSMEs, \nwhich account for 99.6% of total firms and 61% of total employment in the Philippines. A recent study \nof the Philippines found that access to formal sector financing is indeed one of the key constraints that \nstrongly affect firms\u2019 dynamism (see Khor, Sebastian, and Aldaba 2013). At the same time, MSMEs do \nnot have easy access to the equities nor bonds market.   \n\n \nThe overarching objective of the Magna Carta legislation was to \u201cpromote, support, strengthen \nand  encourage  the  growth  and  development  of  MSMEs  in  all  productive  sectors  of  the  economy \nparticularly rural/agri-based enterprises.\u201d1 The Magna Carta was first enacted and implemented in 1991 \n(courtesy of Republic Act 6977)\u2014a time when the authorities were grappling for ways to resurrect an \nailing economy following a decade or so of tumultuous business climate. In the subsequent 20 years, \nthe law was amended twice to take into account the changes in the business and economic conditions. \n\n \nThe  Magna  Carta  mandated  banks  to  allot  a  certain  portion  (10%)  of  their  loan  portfolio  to \nMSMEs. Although not explicitly mentioned, there are at least three good reasons why the regulation \nspecifically targeted banks. Firstly, banks hold the biggest stock of financial resources in the economy \namounting  to  over  three  quarters  of  the  domestic  financial  resources.  Secondly,  banks  do  have  the \nmost  extensive  network  of  offices  among  credit  intermediaries.  Lastly,  banks  are  easier  to  monitor \nsince they regularly report their activities to the central bank. While there were questions raised on the \nrationale  of  the  policy,  Medalla  and  Ravallo  (1997)  argued  that  this  kind  of  measure  can  be  justified \nfrom a social standpoint since otherwise, banks are driven to channel funds to projects that generate \nhigh private returns but not necessarily social returns.  \n\n \nMandated credit program such as the  Magna Carta is  not unique to the Philippines. Lending \ntargets  set  for  priority  sectors,  including  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  are  imposed  in \ndeveloping economies such as Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The Magna Carta is also not \nthe first mandated credit provision imposed on Filipino banks. In 1974, the central bank directed banks \nto allot a portion of their loan portfolio to the agriculture sector via Circular No. 408.2 This central bank \nissuance  eventually  became  known  as  the  Agri-Agra  Law  (AAL)  and  continues  to  be  an  active \nregulation to date. 3 \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Republic  Act  No.  9501.  Magna  Carta  for  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Enterprises  (MSMEs).  http://www.lawphil.net/ \n\nstatutes/repacts/ra2008/ra_9501_2008.html  \n\n2   This was a circular issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines, which was renamed Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in 1993. \n3   BSP Circular 736-2011 and the Agri-Agra Reform Credit Act of 2009 (RA 10000). \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\nHow  has  the  Magna  Carta  impacted  banks\u2019  lending  towards  MSMEs?  Surprisingly,  literature \nassessing the implementation of the law and its economic impact is very limited. Medalla and Ravallo \n(1997)  assessed  the  way banks  responded  to  the AAL  and  the  Magna  Carta.  The  authors  found  out \nthat  between  1975  and  1996,  AAL  compliance  ratios  had  continuously  declined.  It  added  that \ncompounded  annual  growth  (CAGR)  of  AAL  loans  during  the  period  is  roughly  3  percentage  points \nlower  than  the  CAGR  of  the  banks\u2019  total  loan  portfolio.  They  also  mentioned  that  until  1988,  banks \nhave taken advantage of alternative compliance in the form of special series treasury bills that masked \nthe  degree  of  decline  in  lending  such  that  when  it  was  removed,  the  drop  in  lending  became  very \napparent. The authors also noted that from 1991 to 1996, aggregate compliance ratios to the Magna \nCarta by bank type remained above what the law requires by a good margin. They just highlighted that \nforeign banks tend not to comply with the law on a consistent basis and are drawn toward alternative \ncompliance mechanisms rather investing directly in firms in spite of the general trend in the industry \nthat is skewed heavily on direct lending. \n\n \nFurthermore, little is known on the compliance with Magna Carta beyond 1996. This paper is \nthus undertaken to investigate the patterns of bank lending to MSME in the Philippines after the 2008 \nGlobal Financial Crisis and in conjunction to that, the compliance of banks to the Magna Carta lending \nprovisions post 1996. We will also attempt to shed light on the characteristics of banks base on their \nlending exposure to the MSMEs in terms of bank type, ownership, geographic region, and initial levels \nof  compliance.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  publicly  available  study  on  MSME  lending  in  the \nPhilippines from banks\u2019 perspective. \n\n \nThis  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  II  briefly  describes  the  domestic  financial  market \nconditions, the customary sources of credit of MSMEs in the Philippines and the government initiatives \nto boost MSME financing particularly the Magna Carta. Section III will layout the salient features of the \nlending provisions of the Magna Carta. Section IV will assess the trends of bank lending to MSMEs as \nwell as their compliance to the lending provisions of the Magna Carta using the datasets compiled by \nthe central bank of the Philippines, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) up to end of 2012. Section V will \nexplain  recent  developments  that  could  potentially  influence  banks\u2019  lending  behavior  concerning \nMSMEs in the near term. Section VI will summarize the key findings of this paper. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nFINANCING MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN THE PHILIPPINES \n\nDefinitions \n\n \nA. \n \nMSMEs in the Philippines are defined in two ways. The first definition is based on employment levels \nused by the National Statistics Office (NSO). The second definition is based on asset values used by \nthe BSP (Table 1). This presents a challenge when we examine data on MSMEs financing since there \nexists no harmonized supply and demand-side dataset. Credit demand-side data on firms are usually \nbased  on  employment  clusters  since  these  datasets  (e.g.,  profile  of  MSMEs)  are  mostly  compiled  by \nthe  NSO.  On  the  other  hand,  credit  supply-side  data  (e.g.,  lending  of  banks)  are  typically  based  on \nasset clusters defined by the BSP since reporting banks have to follow the BSP\u2019s framework. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   3 \n\nTable 1: Definitions of MSMEs in the Philippines\n\n \n\nFirm Type \nMicro \nSmall \nMedium \nLarge \n\nNSO, Employment Level Range \n(number of employees) \n1\u20139 \n10\u201399 \n100\u2013199 \n>200 \n\nBSP, Asset Size Range (P) \n<3,000,000\n3,000,001\u201315,000,000 \n15,000,001\u2013100,000,000 \n>100,000,00\n\nBSP = Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, MSME = micro, small, and medium enterprise, NSO = National Statistics Office.             \nSources: SMED Council Resolution No. 1 (2003); Republic Act 9501 (2008). \n\n \n\n \n\nMSMEs comprise almost all of the total number of firms in the Philippines. Based on the 2011 \nsurvey data from the NSO 90.6% were microenterprises (Table 2). They employ roughly 61% of the \ntotal  employees  in  the  economy.

MSMEs accounted for a mere 0.005% of total market capitalization by end of 2012, \nand  are  also  not  considered  reputable  enough  to  enter  the  bonds  market.7 Other  large  scale  credit \nsources  like  quasi  banks,  investment  houses,  and  insurance  companies  typically  also  shy  away  from \nMSME  clients  while  the  role  of  venture  capital  firms  remain  quite  small.  Thus,  given  that  access  to \nformal financing is relatively scarce for MSMEs, capital options usually narrow to informal sectors, such \nas financing cooperatives, savings and loans associations, pawnshops, and informal sector lenders. \n\n \nAssessments  of  credit  provisions  suggest  that  MSMEs  depend  more  on  their  internally \ngenerated  resources  to  bankroll  their  operations  (Table  3),  while  formal  financial  institutions  only \ncontribute  somewhere  between  11%  and  21%  of  the  MSMEs\u2019  capital  utilization.  The  lack  of  reliable \nfinancial information from MSMEs leads to the perception of higher risk. In addition, lower expected \nprofitability,  the  absence  of  \u201cacceptable\u201d  collateral  by  MSMEs,  the  lack  of  a  national  credit  rating \nsystem for MSMEs contribute to the low loan releases from banks to the sector. \n \n\nTable 3: SMEs' Sources of Funding\n(% of current funding) \n\n \n  \n\nOwn resources \nBank loans \nNonbank financial institution \nInformal creditb \nTotal \n\nSERDEF-UP ISSI, \n1992 \n78 \n15 \n  \n7 \n100 \n\nWBES, \n2000 \n52 \n21 \n  \n27 \n100 \n\nICPS-ADB, \n2004 \n60 \n11 \n  \n29 \n100 \n\nPEP-IFC, \n2006 \n69 \n19 \n  \n12 \n100 \n\nWBES, \n2009a \n76.4 \n10.2 \n0.9 \n12.4 \n\n100 \n\nICPS-ADB = Investment Climate and Productivity Study, Asian Development Bank, PEP-IFC = Private Enterprise Partnership for the \nPhilippines (PEP-Philippines) SME Financing Survey, International Finance Corporation, SERDEF-UP ISSI = Small Enterprise Research and \nDevelopment Foundation-University of the Philippines  Institute for Small Scale Industries; SME = small and medium enterprise, WBES = \nWorld Bank Enterprise Survey. \na   Shares in the firms' working capital. \nb   Purchases on credit from suppliers/advances from customers + loans from moneylenders, friends, and relatives. \nSources: Nangia and Villancourt 2007; WBES 2009. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7   By  the  end  of  December  2012,  the  declared  market  capitalization  of  SMEs  in  the  Philippine  stock  exchange  is \n\nP586.4 million ($14.2 million) whereas the total market capitalization is P10.9 trillion ($265.3 billion). \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   5 \n\nThe Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Magna Carta \n\nC. \n \nIn an effort to aid MSMEs with their credit needs, the Philippine authorities crafted a legislation that \nmandated banks to allocate 10% of their lending portfolio to MSMEs. The MSME Magna Carta, as it is \ncommonly known, also laid out a number of important parameters and measures in support of its main \nobjective. Some of these measures are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIt  compartmentalized  enterprises  according  to  asset  size  and  laid  out  a  coordinated \nstructural  support  and  safeguards  system  to  enhance  growth  of  enterprises  classified \nunder micro, cottage, small, and medium; \nIt streamlined business procedures and requirements, made government services readily \navailable to businesses outside the centers of commerce, and \u201cincentivized\u201d financing to \nthe MSMEs; \nIt  created  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Council8 as  an  attached \nagency of the Department of Trade and Industry to carry out the objectives of the law \nand appointed the Bureau of Small and Medium Enterprises Development (BSMBD)9 as \nthe council secretariat; \nIt stipulated monetary and nonmonetary incentives and directed government banks (at \nthat time include the Philippine National Bank, the Development Bank of the Philippines \nand the Land Bank of the Philippines) to provide financing assistance to entrepreneurs \nunder these groups; and \nIt created the Small Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation (SBGFC) to improve \nproduction  operations  and  business  network  of  firms,  to  provide  financial  services  to \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (except  those  involved  in  trading  and  crop-level \nproduction) and develop alternative modes of financing and guarantee loans secured by \n\u201cqualified  SMEs.\u201d  The  SBGFC  and  the  Guarantee  Fund  for  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprises10 were  merged  in  November  2001  to  form  the  Small  Business  Corporation \n(SBC)  to  consolidate  their  resources.11 The  new  SBC  and  the  much  older  Philippine \nExport-Import  Credit  Agency  are  presently  the  two  main  agencies  charged  to  assist \nSMEs (which was later expanded to MSMEs) when it comes to their finances.12  \n\n \nThe  Magna  Carta  specifically  targeted  banks  given  that  they  hold  over  75%  of  total  financial \nsector\u2019s  assets  in  the  Philippines.  In  addition,  banks  have  an  extensive  network  of  offices  and  credit \nchannels and are administratively easier to monitor since banks have to regularly report their activities \nto the central bank. \n\n \nThe  Magna  Carta  was  amended  twice  (RA  6977  amended  by  RA  8289  and  RA  9501)  in  an \neffort to make the legislation in tune with the changes in firms\u2019 needs and the economic conditions. In \n\n                                                 \n8   This agency was later renamed as the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Development Council (MSMEDC). \n9   This bureau was later renamed as Bureau of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (BMSMED). \n10   The Guarantee Fund for Small and Medium Enterprises was established in 1984 operated by the Livelihood Corporation \nattached to the office of the president tasked to provide guarantee services to participating financial institutions (PFIs) \nthat had been lending to SMEs. (ADB 2010) \n\n11   The agency which was put under the supervision of the central bank has a board comprised of representatives both from \nthe private sector and the public sector, namely the National Government, Land Bank of the Philippines, Development \nBank of the Philippines, Department of Trade and Industry, and Department of Finance (DOF). \n\n12   The Philippine Export-Import Credit Agency (PhilEXIM) was established in 1977 under the DOF, to pursue the policy of \nthe State \u201cto encourage and promote the expansion  of Philippine exports and to establish a strong and credible export \ncredit  institution,  which  shall  be  dedicated  to  the  provision  of  export  financing  facilities  and  services  to  support  the \ncountry\u2019s sector (See PhilEXIM\u2019s website). See also ADB (2005). \n\n \n\n\f6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\nparticular,  the  thresholds  for  asset-based  enterprise  classification  were  significantly  adjusted  in  1997 \nand  2002.  The  thresholds  for  micro  and  medium  firms  changed  the  most,  approximately  tripling \nbetween  1991  and  1997,  and  roughly  doubling  between  1997  and  2002  (Table  4).  These  variations \nwould prove to be very important to banks in their compliance to the mandated lending provision of \nthe law. The increased thresholds mean that their target market for MSMEs had also increased in size.  \n\n \n\nTable 4: Evolution of Asset-Based Definition of MSMEs  \n \n\nLaw/ \nRegulation \nRA 6977 \n\nYear \nEnacted \n1991 \n\nMicro \n \n\n<50,000 \n\nRA 8289 \n\n1997 \n\n<1,500,001 \n\nCottage \n \n50,001\u2013\n500,000 \n \n\nSMED Councila  \n and RA 9501 \n\n2003 \n2008 \n\n<3,000,000 \n\n \n\nSmall \n(P) \n500,001\u2013\n5,000,000 \n1,500,001\u2013\n15,000,000 \n3,000,001\u2013\n15,000,000 \n\nMedium \n \n5,000,001\u2013\n20,000,000 \n15,000,001\u2013\n60,000,000 \n15,000,001\u2013\n100,000,000 \n\nLarge \n \n>20,000,000 \n\n>60,000,000 \n\n>100,000,00 \n\nMSME = micro, small, and medium enterprise; RA = Republic Act; SMED = Small and Medium Enterprise Development. \na   Refers to SMED Council Resolution No. 1 (2003). \n \n\nIn  addition,  the  coverage  of  the  law  and  the  statutory  share  of  MSMEs  in  bank  lending  have \nalso changed over the years (Table 5). While the required ratio has fluctuated between 5% and 10% \nsince 1991, the mandated coverage has continually increased beyond small firms. The revision in 1997 \nextended  coverage  to  medium  firms.  The  law  also  recognized  that  medium  firms  are  fundamentally \ndifferent from smaller firms, hence the establishments of two separate compliance rates for medium \nand smaller firms. By the last revision in 2008, the law was extended to cover microenterprises. While \nthe  2008  revision  also  further  distinguished  microenterprises  from  other  small  enterprises,  the \ncompliance rates for small and micro were still aggregated into the same category under the law. As of \nthe 2008 revision, the  law mandates  all banks to  allocate 2%  of their total loan portfolio to medium \nfirms, and a further 8% to micro and small firms. \n \n\nTable 5: Mandatory Share of MSME in Banks\u2019 Loan Portfolio \n\nLaw \nRA 6977 \n\nRA 8289 \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \nEnacted \n\n     1991 \n\nSmall \n\nCoverage (enterprises) \n\n     1997 \n\nSmall and medium \n\nShare in Banks\u2019 Loan Portfolio  \n(years in effect) \n\n5% (1991); 10% (1992\u20131995); 5% \n(1996); 0% (1997) \nSmall: 6% (1997\u20132007)a \nMedium: 2% (1997\u20132007) \n\nMedium: 2% (2008\u20132018)a \n\nRA 9501;  \nBSP Circular 625 (2008) \n\n    2008 \n\nMicro, small, and medium  Micro and Small: 8% (2008\u20132018) \n\nBSP = Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; MSME = micro, small, and medium enterprise; RA = Republic Act. \na   RA 8289 should have ended in May 2007 but implementation of the lending provision was extended until early December 2008  \n(BSP Circular Letter 2007-039) because the BSP issued circular 625-2008 pursuant to RA 9501 only on 14 October 2008, which \nbecame effective 15 days after it was published on 20 October 2008.  \n\nIn the present form of the law, firms considered eligible to be covered by the law have to satisfy \nthe  following  four  conditions.

Notably, according to an ADB report (2004), \n\u201cSBC\u2019s management has discovered (as have many other lenders in many places) that there is no clear \ncorrelation between the kind and quality of collateral offered to a lender and loan default. This implies \nthat  loan  underwriting  techniques  that  do  not  rely  on  traditional  collateral  are  highly  relevant  in  the \nPhilippines.\u201d \n\n \n\n                                                 \n13   \u201cThis  requirement  shall  not  preclude MSMEs  from  accepting  subcontracts  and  entering  into  franchise  partnership  with \n\nlarge enterprises or from joining in cooperative activities with other MSME\u201d (RA 9501). \n\n14   BSP Media Release (2 February 2004). \n\n \n\n\f8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\nTo  further  strengthen  its  overall  approach  to  facilitate  financing  for  SMEs,  the  government \nimplemented the SME Unified Lending Opportunities for National Growth (SULONG) program. The \nSULONG  program,  launched  in  2003,  essentially  sought  to  provide  SMEs  alternative  credit  sources \nthrough  participating  government  financial  institutions.15 The  general  objectives  of  the  program  were \nto:  (i)  simplify  and  standardize  the  lending  procedures,  (ii)  reduce  documentary  requirements  and \nexpedite procedures, (iii) provide SMEs greater access to short- and long-term funds, and (iv) lower \nthe effective cost of borrowing by SMEs and liberalize the requirement.16 \n\n \nFinally, the BSP also rolled out the Credit Surety Fund program on 2 July 2008. The rationale of \nthis fund is \u201cto increase the credit worthiness MSMEs that are experiencing difficulty in obtaining loans \nfrom  banks  due  to  lack  of  acceptable  collaterals,  credit  knowledge  and  credit  track  records\u201d  (BSP, \n2013b).  Essentially,  the  Credit  Surety  Fund  can  serve  as:  (i)  an  alternative  to  acceptable  collaterals, \n(ii) security for loans of MSMEs that are members of a cooperative, and (iii) an assurance for payment \nof bank loans. Investors in the fund are comprised of cooperatives, nongovernment organizations, local \ngovernment units, banks (e.g., Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines, and \nIndustrial Guarantee and Loan Fund), donors, and the BSP. Eligible borrowers include MSMEs who are \nmembers of cooperatives and who have businesses that meet certain conditions.17 \n\n \nThe Structure of the Banking Industry in the Philippines \n\nE. \n \nThe banking industry in the Philippines forms the core of the financial system in the Philippines. By end \nof  2012,  banks  hold  80%  of  the  approximately  P10  trillion  of  total  domestic  financial  assets.18 \nNonbanks,  which  include  investment  houses  and  companies,  finance  companies,  securities  dealers \nand  brokers,  pawnshops,  lending  investors,  nonstock  savings  and  loan  associations,  venture  capital \ncorporations, private and government insurance companies, and credit card companies accounted for \nthe remaining 20%.

The law also classified banks in the Philippines \nas universal banks, commercial banks, thrift banks, rural and cooperative banks, or Islamic banks. The \nMonetary Board, which is the decision-making body of the central bank, may also create another type \nof bank if the need arises. The minimum capitalizations are highest for universal banks (P4.95 billion), \nfollowed by commercial banks (P2.4 billion), thrift banks (P1 billion for those headquartered in Manila \nand P250 million for others). The minimum capital requirement for rural banks and cooperatives are \nmuch lower, ranging from P100 million for those headquartered in Manila to below P5 million for those \nbased in rural 5th\u20136th class municipalities (Table 7). In our subsequent analysis, we group all these \ninstitutions into three broad groups: universal and commercial banks (UKBs), thrift banks (THBs or \nthrifts), and rural and cooperative banks (RCBs or rural co-ops). The average UKB has approximately \n20 times the assets of the average thrift bank, which in turn has average total assets 20 times the \naverage rural and cooperative banks. \n \n\nTable 7: Minimum Capitalization Requirement by Bank Type in the Philippines \n \nMinimum Capitalization\n\nAdditional Major Statutes aside from \nthe General Banking Law \n\nBank Type \nUniversalb, e \nCommercialc, e  \nThriftd \n\nHead Office: \n\nMetro Manila \n\nOther areas \n\nRural \n\nHead Office: \n\nMetro Manila \n\nCities of Cebu and Davao \n\nCities of Cebu and Davao \n\nOther cities \n\n1st\u20134th class municipalities \n\n5th\u20136th class municipalities \n\nCooperative \n\nP billion  \n4.95 \n\n2.40 \n\n$ milliona \n120.17 \n\n58.26 \n\n1.00 \n\n0.50 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.05 \n\n0.025 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.005 \n\n0.010 \n\n24.28 \n\n12.14 \n\n6.07 \n\n2.43 \n\n1.21 \n\n0.61 \n\n0.24 \n\n0.12 \n\n0.24 \n\nThrift Banks Act (RA 7906) \n\nRural Banks Act (RA 7353) \n\nCooperative Code (RA 6938) \n\nRA = Republic Act. \na   2012 end-of-period P/$ exchange rate is 41.1920. \nb  \n\nIncludes Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines (AAIB), which is the only Islamic Bank in the country at present. \nAAIB is governed by its own charter, i.e., Charter of Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines (RA 6848). \nIncludes specialized government banks. \nIncludes savings and mortgage banks, private development banks, and stock savings and loan associations. \n\nc  \nd  \ne   See General Banking Law of 2000 for the features delineating universal and commercial banks.

All of the 37 UKBs accounted altogether for \n89.4% of total banking assets, 86.3%  of total  loans,  88.6% of total deposits, as well as 54.7% of total \n\n \n\n\f10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\nbank offices around the country. Within this UKB group, there was also a huge dispersion in terms of \nresources: the biggest 10 UKBs housed 74.4% of the segment\u2019s assets, release 74.3% of the segment\u2019s \nloans, handle 71.9% of the segment\u2019s deposits, and operate 83.7% of all the segment\u2019s offices. In other \nwords, two-thirds of the Philippines\u2019 total financial assets and loans were concentrated in the top 10 \nuniversal and commercial banks in the country.19 \n\n \nCompared  to  the  universal  and  commercial  banks,  the  other  banking  institutions  in  the \nPhilippines  were  comparatively  much  smaller.  Rural  and  cooperative  banks,  which  accounted  for \n84.6% of all banking institutions (589 institutions out of 696 total in 2012), only accounted for 2.4% \nbanking  sector\u2019s  value,  3%  of  total  lending,  2.2%  of  total  deposits  while  running  just  28.1%  of  all  the \nbanking counters nationwide. Thrift banks, which were represented by 70 institutions, hold only 8.3% \nof the sector\u2019s total assets, disburse 10.7% of total loans, and manage 9.2% deposits through their 1,619 \nbank offices (17.2% of total) (Table 8).  \n\nTable 8: Financial Indicators and Bank Network (units) by Bank Type, Philippines, 2012\n \n\nAssets \n7,193.8 \n\nLoans \n3,617.2 \n\nDeposits \n5,097.5 \n\nCapital \n937.1 \n\nHead Office \n37 \n\nBranches \n5,108 \n\n5,350.2 \n\n2,686.6 \n\n3,931.1 \n\n666.2 \n\n189.7 \n\n446.6 \n\n127.5 \n\n529.8 \n\n126.4 \n\n673.6 \n\n81.1 \n\n33.3 \n\n8,049.7 \n\n4,191.3 \n\n5,753.6 \n\n1,051.5 \n\n10 \n\n70 \n\n589 \n\n696 \n\n89.4 \n\n86.3 \n\n88.6 \n\n89.1 \n\n5.3 \n\n74.4 \n\n66.5 \n\n8.3 \n\n2.4 \n\n74.3 \n\n64.1 \n\n10.7 \n\n3.0 \n\n77.1 \n\n68.3 \n\n9.2 \n\n2.2 \n\n71.9 \n\n64.1 \n\n7.7 \n\n3.2 \n\n27.0 \n\n1.4 \n\n10.1 \n\n84.6 \n\nTotal \nOffices \n\n5,145 \n\n4,307 \n\n1,619 \n\n2,646 \n\n9,410 \n  \n\n54.7 \n\n \n\n83.7 \n\n45.8 \n\n17.2 \n\n28.1 \n\n4,297 \n\n1,549 \n\n2,057 \n\n8,714 \n\n58.6 \n\n84.1 \n\n49.3 \n\n17.8 \n\n23.6 \n\n \n\nLevel (P billion) \nUKBa \nof which: Top 10 \n\nTHB \n\nRCB \n\nTotal \n\nUKB \n\nDistribution (%) \n\nof which: Top 10 \n\n% of UKB \n\n% of Total \n\nTHB \n\nRCB \n\nRCB = rural and cooperative bank, THB = thrift bank, UKB = universal and commercial bank. \na  Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines is subsumed under UKB (per BSP directory of Banks). \nSources: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; Annual Reports and Press Releases of the top 10 banks (by asset size) for the number of branches. \n \n\nIn  general,  each  category  of  banks  operate  in  distinct  markets,  though  the  market  niches  are \nstarting  to  overlap.  Rural  and  cooperative  banks  typically  focused  on  retail  clients  and  microloans  in \nthe countryside. The universal and commercial banks, on the other hand, serve as the primary arteries \nof  credit  for  larger  urban  firms  and  are  usually  part  of  a  bigger  conglomerate  groups  themselves.20 \n\n                                                 \n19   The top 10 universal and commercial banks by asset size in 2012 were: BDO Unibank Inc., Metropolitan Bank and Trust \nCompany, Bank of the Philippine Islands, Land Bank of the Philippines, Development Bank of the Philippines, Philippine \nNational  Bank,  China  Banking  Corporation,  Rizal  Commercial  Banking  Corporation,  Union  Bank  of  the  Philippines,  and \nSecurity Bank Corporation. \n\n20   However, the BSP has prescribed limitations to loans, other credit accommodations and guarantees to directors, officers, \nstockholders, and their related interests (DOSRI). Based on the Manual of Regulations for Banks of 2011 (Sec. X330), the \ngeneral principle is that \"the total outstanding loans, other credit accommodations and guarantees to each of the bank\u2019s \nDOSRI shall be limited to an amount equivalent to their respective unencumbered deposits and book value of their paid-\nin capital contribution in the bank: Provided, however, that unsecured loans, other credit accommodations and guarantees \nto  each  of  the  bank\u2019s  DOSRI  shall  not  exceed  thirty  percent  (30%)  of  their  respective  total  loans,  other  credit \naccommodations and guarantees.\" \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   11 \n\nLastly, the thrift banks, some of which were large enough to compete with universal and commercial \nbanks  for  big  borrowers,  normally  focus  on  small  and  medium  enterprises  in  metropolitan  and \nprovincial business centers left unaddressed by the UKBs. It is also important to note that a number of \nmajor thrift banks are likewise either affiliates of UKBs or financial arms of big holding companies. \n \n\nA Brief Political-Economic History of the Philippine Banking Industry \n \nPrior to extensive structural changes in the last 2 decades, the government has played the role of the primordial driver of \nthe  banking  sector  (as  is  the  case  with  other  key  sectors  such  as  aviation,  telecommunication,  water,  power,  etc.).a \nHowever,  political  intrusion  leading  to  regulatory  lapses  and  poor  oversight  had  resulted  in  an  unstable  industry  growth \npath and severely impacted the government\u2019s coffers. The local banking system barely escaped collapse in the 1970s and \nthe early part of 1980s.b The banking crisis of the 1980s was particularly remarkable since it led to the insolvencies of two \nlarge investment houses, three commercial banks (including two of the largest banks in the country that are state-owned), \nand 160 rural and thrift banks (Nascimento 1990).c \n \nIn 1984 and 1985, a series of difficult economic episodes crippled the domestic capital market and eventually caused the \neconomy to contract.d Capital infusion by the national government kept the banking system afloat while a standby credit \narrangement with the International Monetary Fund was needed to restore the credibility of the country in the international \nfinancial network\u2014mainly in terms of availability of foreign reserves, albeit at a huge cost to the public (Nascimento 1990, \nDohner and Intal, Jr. 1989). Subsequently, the process of reforming the entire industry forced the government to sell to the \nprivate sector a substantial amount of its shares in two major banks.e Reform measures also compelled the restructuring \nand recapitalization of the central bank that itself went bankrupt.f \n\nAs conditions improved, further liberalization measures were carried out in the first half of 1990s involving entry of foreign \nbanks, bank branching regulations, and foreign exchange transactions. The easing of restrictions resulted in a more fluid \nmovement  of  capital  and,  accordingly,  a  sharp  rise  in  the  number  of  branches  in  a  very  short  time  (See  box  figure). \nNonetheless, the number of banks declined marginally due to continuous market consolidation especially in the rural and \ncooperative banks segment (Pasadilla and Milo 2005).  \n \n\n                                        a.

Although  the  local  banking  system  generally  proved  to  be  resilient,  the  credit  crunch  and  the  very  steep \ncurrency revaluation caused some small banks to fail. Systemwide nonperforming loans also inched up considerably from \n2.6%  in  1996  to  17.6%  midway  in  2002. Uncertainties  over  the  length  and  depth  of  the  impact  of  the  crisis  on  the  local \nbanks have also pushed monetary authorities to operate at very restrictive mode.g \n \nIn  2000,  a  new  central  bank  charter  was  passed  into  law  largely  to  strengthen  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas\u2019  (BSP) \nsupervisory and oversight functions as well as to improve its crisis response toolkit. In a nutshell, the General Banking Law \n(RA 8791), as it is more commonly known, granted the BSP the authority to oversee and administer compliance of banks \nto  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  inquire  into  the  solvency  and  liquidity  of  financial  institutions  (e.g.,  foreign  and  local \nbanks,  quasibanks,  and  trust  entities,  and  other  types  of  banks),  enforce  prompt  corrective  action,  determine  policy \ndirection in the areas of money, banking and credit, and to the extent feasible, ensure compliance to the internationally \naccepted standards, including of the Bank for International Settlements. \n \nRestrictions  were  gradually  relaxed  as  ill-effects  of  the  regional  financial  turmoil  started  to  wane  and  as  macro  and \nmicroprudential  measures  that  were  erected  began  to  deepen  their  roots.  Banks  have  likewise  become  more  careful  in \nmanaging  risks  in  the  years  following  the  Asian  financial  crisis.h  Thus,  in  contrast  to  the  severe  impacts  of  the  Asian \nfinancial  crisis,  the  recent  global  financial  crisis  made  a  much  smaller  dent  on  the  books  of  the  banks.i  Such  display  of \nfinancial resilience gave the BSP a much bigger policy room to  maneuver without having to  take draconian  measures in \norder  to  keep  the  spillovers  in  check.  Instead,  the  central  bank  opted  for  a  series  of  policy  rate  adjustments  and  a  2 \npercentage  point  cut  in  the  statutory  reserve  requirement  to  ensure  that  the  system  remains  liquid.j  In  2011,  the  BSP \nlikewise  removed  the  last  of  the  branching  regulation  put  in  place  12  years  earlier  to  create  a  more  accommodative \nregulatory structure.k \n \na   The Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) alone (both state-owned banks at that time) held nearly \n\nb  \n\n50% of the banking sector\u2019s assets before they became insolvent in 1985 (Gochoco-Bautista 1999). \n \u201cAfter a long era of political intrusion under the Marcos regime, there is a principal\u2013agent problem as regulators and supervisors may \nnot be operating in the public interest. Meanwhile, private banks belong to business conglomerates and do not act tough on affiliated \ncompanies since they can expect financial assistance from BSP,\u201d (Nasution 1999). \n\nc   According to Gochoco-Baustista (1999), the Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which are \nboth  government  controlled  at  that  time,  were  declared  insolvent  owing  largely  to  excessive  lending  to  DOSRI.  Nascimento  (1990) \nnoted  that  on  top  of  the  economy-related  factors,  what  happened  to  DPB  and  PNB  was  a  reflection  of  politically  motivated  loans \ngranted sometime in the 1970s until the early 1980s, poor internal controls, auditing, and lending standards, and the decision to take \nover troubled corporations. The government assumed the liabilities of both banks and PNB was eventually privatized. \n\nd   The value of the Philippine peso was cut by more than 50% within 2 years. Inflation ranged between 33% and 63%, which lasted for \nabout a year. Dollar reserves slumped to critical levels causing external trade and debt financing problems (balance of payments crisis). \nOn  top  of  these,  the  assassination  of  Senator  Benigno  Aquino  in  1983  almost  annihilated  the  positive  investment  prospects  for  the \ncountry (Nascimento 1990). \n\ne   These are PNB and Union Bank. PNB was the biggest bank in the country at that time in terms of assets. \nf   The  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  itself  became  bankrupt  mainly  due  to  the  assumption  of  foreign  liabilities  and  other  quasifiscal \nactivities (Singson 1999). After its restructuring in 1993, the Central Bank of the Philippines was renamed Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. \ng   Manlag\u00f1it and Lamberte (2004) discuss in greater details the various banking sector reforms undertaken after the Asian financial crisis. \nh   Banks\u2019 NPLs ratio eased from a high of 17.6% in Q1 2002 to 3.1% as of Q3 2011 while the sector managed to maintain a healthy capital \nadequacy ratio\u201317.4% as of Q1 2011, well above the statutory requirement of 10% and the Basel Agreement benchmark of 8% (See BSP, \nReports on Economic and Financial Developments). \n\ni   BSP Status Reports on the Philippine Financial System, 2nd semester of 2009 and 1st semester 2010 \nj   Overall reserve requirement ratio was cut by 2 percentage points in November 2008, from 21% to 19% through a reduction in statutory \nreserve requirement from 10% to 8%. The ratio was brought back to 21% in July 2011 (via two separate increases in statutory reserve \nrequirement from 8% to 9% in June 2011 and from 9% to 10% in July 2011) but was slashed by 3 percentage points again, from 21% to \n18%  in  February  2012  (effective  April  2012)  designed  to  offset  the  impact  on  banks  of  reduced  revenue  stream  as  the  monetary \nauthorities  decided  to  stop  interest  payments  on  bank  reserves  placed  with  the  central  bank  (referred  to  as  the  statutory  reserve \nequivalent to 10% of banks\u2019 deposits). The monetary authorities likewise decided to unify (i.e., no longer  makes distinction) liquidity \nand statutory reserve requirement.

The \nBSP  allows  banks  various  channels  to  comply  with  the  mandatory  credit  allocation  for  MSMEs. \nBasically,  these  can  be  divided  into  two  categories  namely,  the  direct  compliance  and  the  indirect \ncompliance. As stipulated in BSP Circular 625 issued in 2008, ways to comply directly are enumerated \nbelow, and vary across the targeted firm size. \n \nFor micro and small enterprises: \n \n\n(i)  Actual  extension  of  loans  to  eligible  MSEs,  other  than  to  Barangay  Microbusiness \nEnterprises (BMBEs) which are covered in Item \u201cc(3)\u201d hereof:21  Provided, however, that \nloans granted to MSEs other than BMBEs, to the extent funded by wholesale lending of, \nor  rediscounted  with,  another  bank  shall  not  be  eligible  as  compliance  with  the \nmandatory credit allocation; or \n\n(ii)  Loans granted to export, import, and domestic micro and small scale traders, other than \nto  BMBEs  which  are  covered  in  Item  \u201cc(3)\u201d  hereof:    Provided,  however,  that  loans \ngranted  to  MSEs  other  than  BMBEs,  to  the  extent  funded  by  wholesale  lending  of,  or \nrediscounted with, another bank shall not be eligible as compliance with the mandatory \ncredit allocation; or \n\n(iii)  Purchase of eligible MSE loans listed in Items \u201cc(1)\u201d and \u201cc(2)\u201d on a \u201cwithout recourse\u201d \n\nbasis from other banks and financial institutions;22 or \n\n(iv)  Purchase/discount on a \u201cwith or without recourse\u201d basis of MSE receivables, other than \n\nBMBE receivables which are covered in Item \u201cc(3)\u201d hereof; or \n\n(v)  Wholesale lending or rediscounting facility granted to participating financial institutions \n(PFIs)  for  on-lending  to  MSEs,  other  than  to  BMBEs  which  are  covered  in  Item  \u201cc(3)\u201d \nhereof; or \n\n(vi)  Wholesale  lending  or  rediscounting  facility  granted  to  PFIs  for  on-lending  to  export, \nimport,  and  domestic  micro  and  small  scale  traders,  other  than  to  BMBEs  which  are \ncovered in Item \u201cc(3)\u201d hereof; or \n\n(vii)  Commercial letters of credit outstanding, net of margin deposits, issued for the account \n\nof MSEs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n21  Item c(3) under subsection X342.3 (Eligible credit exposures) of the BSP Manual of Regulations for Bank (MORB) 2008  \nstipulates  the  mechanisms  considered  as  \u201cAlternative  compliance  for  either  or  both  MSEs  or/and  MEs.\"  The  provision \nclassifies \u201cLoans from whatever sources granted to BMBEs as provided under Subsection X365.5\u201d as a form of alternative \ncompliance.

But  this  was  no  longer  included  as  a  mode  of  compliance  under  the  new  Magna  Carta  (RA \n9501) beginning from 2008. \n \nC. \n \nIn case of noncompliance, the current penalty is relatively lenient compared with the previous versions \nof Magna Carta law.  Under initial versions of the law, noncompliant banks are fined by an amount no \nless than P500,000 and other officers of the erring lending institutions shall be individually liable for \nimprisonment  of  not  less  than  6  months.24 The  subsequent  revision  of  the  law  in  1997  extended  the \nloan  earmarking  program  for  SMEs  to  2007,  and  dropped  imprisonment  provision  while  maintaining \nthe monetary fine (Table 5).25 \n \n\nThe monetary penalty for noncompliance varied according to bank types though the amount \nwas miniscule compared to the average banking assets of these institutions.

First we provide an industry-level analysis, which examines the \noverall  aggregate  MSMEs  lending  activity  of  banks  as  a  group.  Second  we  use  bank-level  data  to \nanalyze patterns of compliance to the Magna Carta for MSMEs by individual universal and commercial \nbanks, and thrift banks.  \n \nA. \n \nFor  the  industry  aggregate-level  analysis,  we  used  the  data  on  banking  industry\u2019s  lending  to  MSMEs \nprovided by the BSP. The data series present information about the compliance to the Magna Carta for \n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\f16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\nMSMEs of the three major bank types (UKBs, thrifts, and rural co-ops) covering the years from 1999 to \n2010.  Moreover,  the  data  show  the  disaggregation  of  the  MSME  compliance  to  the  Magna  Carta \naccording to type of compliance; in other words, we know whether the banks complied through direct \ncompliance,  indirect  compliance,  or  \u201cfunds  set  aside  for  MSMEs.\u201d26 However,  as  mentioned  earlier, \nfunds set aside for MSMEs are no longer considered as mode of compliance beginning 2008.  \n \n\nTo assess compliance at the bank-level, we compiled a comprehensive panel dataset from the \nPublished Statements of Condition of each lending institution posted on the BSP\u2019s website. The data \nseries covers periods from the first quarter of 2005 to the second quarter of 2011 but limited to UKBs \nand  thrifts  because  the  BSP  does  not  post  the  compliance  information  for  individual  rural  co-ops. \nWhile  these  published  statements  comprised  the  most  complete  data  publicly  available  on  the \ncompliance  patterns  of  financial  institutions,  we  note  two  caveats  pertaining  to  the  quality  of  data. \nFirstly, the format of the compliance ratios in these published statements (i.e., whether in percentage \nor absolute terms) is not consistent across reports.  Some information do not appear meaningful (e.g., \ncompliance  ratios  that  are  over  100%).  Thus,  caution  was  exercised  in  building  the  panel  dataset  of \ncompliance ratios. Secondly, a number of banks do not report their Magna Carta compliance ratios in \nsome of their public statements. Hence, we need to distinguish zero lending to MSMEs from absence \nof  data.  The  summary  statistics  are  given  in  Tables  1  and  2  in  the  Appendix.  Nevertheless,  our \npostcleaning  final  sample  with  complete  data  consists  of  109  financial  institutions  (out  of  an  initial \nsample of 136), which altogether represented over 90% of the finance sector assets in the Philippines.  \n \nB. \n \nThe outstanding amount lent by all lending institutions to MSMEs increased modestly from 1990 \nto  2010 (Figure 1). Financing to MSMEs rose from P248.2 billion to P308.5 billion in those 12 years, \nrepresenting a growth rate of roughly 24.3% during the period or 2.32% per year growth. UKBs provide \nthe lion\u2019s share of the loan provisions, accounting for 72.9% of the total credit lines in 2010 (which is a \ndecrease from their market share of 83.7% in 1999). THBs, on the other hand, saw their share of MSME \nlending rising from 13% in 1999 to 19.8% in 2010. The strongest growth in market share is observed for \nRCBs, which tripled their share of MSME financing from below 3.3% in 1999 to12.6% in 2009, before \nretreating to just above 7.3% by the end of 2010.  \n \n\nDescriptive Statistics of Aggregate Lending \n\nThe  decline  in  UKBs\u2019  market  share  is  brought  about  by  the  tepid  growth  in  its  lending \noperations  between  1999  and  2010,  which  saw  a  compounded  annual  growth  rate  of  only  0.72%. \nThrifts,  on  their  part,  were  more  aggressive  in  attending  to  MSMEs  capital  needs,  registering  7% \naverage  loan  growth  during  the  11-year  span.  Meanwhile,  RCBs  have  been  the  most  aggressive  in \ncapturing MSMEs\u2019 credit demands, growing its exposure by 20% annually until 2008 until a pullback \nbeginning in 2009. In 2009, total MSME lending by rural co-ops declined by 1.4%, and then contracted \nsharply in 2010 by 41.9%.27  \n \n\nBetween  1990  and  2010,  the  growth  in  MSME  lending  could  be  (almost)  entirely \nattributed  to  the  growth  in  lending  to  medium  enterprises  (Figure  2).  Outstanding  loans  to \nmedium  enterprises  increased  by  almost  50%  from  P100.1  billion  in  1999  to  P149.4  billion  in  2010 \n                                                 \n26   The \u201cfunds set aside for MSMEs\u201d is defined by the BSP (as indicated in the data file) as the item consisting of either Cash \non  Hand  and  Due  from  BSP  which  are  free,  unencumbered,  not  hypothecated,  not  utilized  or  earmarked  for  other \npurposes.  The  Due  from  BSP  is  a  special  account  deposited  with  the  BSP  and  does  not  form  part  of  the  bank's  legal \nreserves. Under the new mandatory credit allocation (RA 9501). \n\n27   The compounded annual growth rate of MSME lending for thrifts was 6%. In contrast, the compounded annual growth \n\nrate for RCBs was 19.3% from 1998 to 2008 and fell to 9.8% by the end of 2010. \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   17 \n\n(representing a CAGR of 3.7%). UKBs provided approximately slightly 80% of total loans to medium \nenterprises during this period.

Thrifts increased their loans to both segments of the MSMEs during the period: increasing \nlending to micro and small firms from P17.8 billion to P38.9 billion (compounded growth rate of 7.4%) \nand  that  to  medium  firms  from  P84.2  billion  to  P121.5  billion  (compounded  growth  rate  of  3.9%). \nAmong the various lending institutions, rural co-ops\u2019 lending to MSMEs grew the most. Their loans to \nmicro and small firms increased fivefold from P6.6 billion in 1999 to P32.4 billion in 2008, although it \nwas halved in the next 2 years to P16.8 billion. Similarly, their loans to medium firms increased more \nthan sevenfold from P1.4 billion in 199 to P9.3 billion in 2009, before scaling back to P5.9 billion. Thus, \nin spite of the sharp downturns between 2009 and 2010, the rural co-ops still registered a strong 11.3% \nannual growth rate in their lending to micro and small enterprises and an average lending growth rate \nof 16.3% for medium enterprises throughout the 11-year period. \n \nC  \n \nThe  aggregate  data  reveals  two  important  trends.  Firstly,  despite  the  increase  in  total  lending \nvolume,  the  share  of  MSMEs  in  the  banking  sector\u2019s  lending  portfolio  has  declined  significantly \nsince  2002.  Secondly,  despite  the  decreasing  share  in  MSME  loans,  aggregate  lending  to  the \nMSME  sector  still  far  exceeds  the  explicit  10%  goal  of  the  Magna  Carta.  At  the  peak  in  2002, \nMSMEs accounted for 30% of the total loan portfolio of all lending institutions. This declined to 16.4% \nin 2010 (Figure 4). The reduction in banks\u2019 MSME exposure is common across banking groups. Thrifts \nhave started moving away from the MSME market in 2000. The UKBs followed a similar track in 2002. \nAnd  even  the  rural  co-ops  began  expanding  more  in  non-MSME  market  in  2006.  Between  their \nrespective  peak  years  (i.e.,  years  when  MSMEs\u2019  share  in  banks\u2019  lending  basket  is  at  its  highest)  and \n2010,  MSMEs\u2019  share  of  total  lending  dropped  dramatically.28 UKBs  reduced  MSMEs\u2019  share  in  their \nportfolio  by  14.8  percentage  points.  Thrifts  reduced  theirs  by  30.6  percentage  points.  Rural  co-ops, \nwhich were focused on the MSME sector, reduced their share the most, decreasing MSME lending by \n23.8 percentage points (from 70.6% of their total loan portfolio down to 46.3%). \n \n\nIt is important to point out that despite the decline, lending to medium firms in 2010 was \nmore than 300% above the Magna Carta target of 2%, while that for micro and small firms were \ncloser  to  the  targeted  8%  of  total  bank  lending. Not so surprisingly, the reduction affected smaller \nfirms  more  than  medium  firms  (Figure  4).  What  is  intriguing  is  that  in  2010,  the  bank  lending  to \nmedium firms, despite declining from a peak of 12.6% of all loans, was still more than threefold of the \nrelevant  Magna  Carta  target.  Meanwhile,  lending  to  the  micro  and  small  segment  was  closer  to  the \nmandatory  requirement  of  8%.  This  is  mainly  driven  by  the  continuous  decline  of  UKB  lending  to \nmedium-sized enterprises\u2014which in itself is already 1.4 percentage points below the legal requirement \nin 2010. Thrifts and rural co-ops, on the other hand, still keep their ratios above what is mandated by \nthe  Magna  Carta  but  the  pace  at  which  these  ratios  are  decreasing  raises  the  question  of  the  future \ntrends for loans to micro and small firms. These trends imply that although absolute levels of lending to \nMSMEs are rising, the growth rates of lending to the said target sectors are consistently slower than the \ngrowth of bank lending to other sectors. \n \n\n                                                 \n28   These periods are as follows: 2000 for THBs (54.3%), 2002 for UKBs (29.1%), and 2006 for RCBs (70.1%). \n\n \n\n\f20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\nFigure 4: Bank Lending to MSMEs, by Type of Bank  \n(% of loan portfolio) \n \n\na.

Data  provided  by  the  central  bank  indicate  that  banks  have  actually  reduced \nexposure to other facilities and instead increased direct lending operations since 2008 to almost 100% \nof their lending to MSMEs. The lack of attractiveness of the yields of alternative notes appears to be \none of the key issues.

But whether these moves could entice more capital remains to be seen. Notably, the ADB loan \ngranted to SBC has been the corporation\u2019s biggest infusion of rolling capital between 2000 and 2010. \nIn  2005  the  loan  accounted  for  11%  of  the  corporation's  total  lending  in  2006,  51%  in  2007,  61%  in \n2008, and 76% in the first half of 2009 (ADB 2010).  \n \nE.  \n \nOverall, we find that the  aggregate loans to MSMEs were greater than targeted by the Magna Carta, \nand  especially  robust  for  loans  to  medium  firms.

This section examines individual bank compliance to the \nMagna Carta for MSMEs, using comprehensive panel data that we have compiled. This is, as far as we \nare  aware,  the  first  panel  data  and  analysis  on  this  question.  Data  on  these  individual  lending \ninstitutions were available quarterly from 2005 to 2011, and did not cover rural and cooperative banks. \n\nGeneral trends of direct compliance by lending institutions \n\n \nData from individual lending institutions reveals significant heterogeneity in the direct \ncompliance of various lending institutions to the law. In particular, there was a decrease in direct \ncompliance amongst universal and commercial banks beginning in the late 2007. Based on the \npublished statements of conditions disclosed by the BSP, approximately 33% of all the UKBs reporting \ndata to the BSP were lending less than 8% of their total loan to micro and small enterprises by 2011. \nAnother 10% of all UKBs also did not meet the 2% of loan portfolio mandatory lending requirement to \nmedium enterprises (Figure 6). \n\nFigure 6: Share of UKBs Not Directly Complying with the Magna Carta \n\na.

In  2005,  noncompliant  UKBs  were  only  about \n5% (small) and 5.3% (medium) of the group. Moreover, about a quarter of the supervised banks has \nnot indicated their MSME lending ratios in their reports. Approximately three quarters of these banks \nwith  no  data  are  foreign-owned.  Based  on  the  available  information  on  loan  portfolios  of  foreign-\nowned banks, it is possible that the actual noncompliance among UKBs could exceed 60% for micro \nand small, and around 25% for medium enterprises.30 \n\n \nOne of the reasons the sharp decrease in direct compliance could be the increase in the mandated \nMSME loan share from 6% to 8% following the revision of the law in 2008.  It is possible that many UKBs \nfound it challenging to increase their loans to micro and small enterprises by another 2 percentage points \nwhen the regulation was altered. Even though microenterprises were added into the equation, this proved \n\n                                                 \n30   In a separate study, SBC also estimated that 60% of UKBs are not complying with the mandated MSE portfolio while 32% \n\nof UKBs are not complying with the mandated ME portfolio (See Lagua 2011). \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   23 \n\nto be of little value to them since microenterprises were not the focus of most UKBs. Unfortunately the \ndata does not disaggregate loans to small and microenterprises. As for UKBs\u2019 declining share of loans to \nmedium  firms,  one  potential  explanation  could  be  the  uncertainties  of  the  economic  conditions  that \naffected the country\u2019s external position following the global financial crisis of 2008. \n\n \nOn  the  other  hand,  direct  compliance  among  thrift  banks  has  increased  from  86%  in \n2005 to almost 97% as of the first quarter of 2011 (Figure 7). Although it appears that the revision \nin the Magna Carta compounded by the sudden downturn in the general business climate has affected \nthe  UKBs  lending  to  MSMEs  adversely,  these  factors  seem  to  have  muted  effect  on  thrift  banks. \nPerhaps, the policy change may have even benefited them since thrift banks (together with rural and \ncooperative  banks)  have  better  access  to  microenterprises  than  the  universal  banks.  Hence,  the \ninclusion  of  microenterprises  in  the  mandated  lending  requirement  has  most  likely  allowed  some  of \nthese thrift banks that are formerly below the benchmark to meet the legal requirement in spite of the \n2 percentage point increase in the legal threshold. \n \n\nFigure 7: Share of THBs Not Directly Complying with the Magna Carta \n \n\na.

We identified 136 banks for which quarterly balance sheet information are provided \nover the period of study, 130 of which reported their lending ratios. We correct for outliers by removing \nbank-quarter  observations  where  the  compliance  ratios  are  below  the  1st  percentile  and  above  the \n99th percentile values. Next, we exclude banks with less than 8 quarters of time series observations. \nThese restrictions enable us to focus on banks with sufficient data on compliance ratios while dropping \nbanks  that  were  previously  merged,  acquired  and  bankrupt.  Our  final  sample  consists  of  109  banks, \nwhich altogether represent over 90% of the assets of all universal, commercial, and thrift banks over \nthe period.  \n\n \n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n\f24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\nWe also define four indicators to measure the degree of banks\u2019 compliance to the Magna Carta \nLaw.  UNDERCOMPLY  is  a  dummy  variable  that  takes  the  value  1  if  the  bank\u2019s  lending  to  the  MSME \nsegment for each quarter is less than the mandatory bank lending requirement. This legal mandate is \n6% for small firms until Q2 2008, and 8%, thereafter; and 2% for medium-sized firms. JUSTCOMPLY is \na  dummy  variable  that  is  equal  to  1  if  the  bank\u2019s  lending  ratio  falls  within  100  to  110%  of  the  target. \nOVERCOMPLY  takes  the  value  of  1  if  the  lending  share  ranges  from  110%  to  200%  of  the  target. \nSUPERCOMPLY is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the loan share for the segment exceeds \nthe respective target by 200%.  \n\n \nJust  as  the  aggregated  data  has  highlighted,  the  average  loan  shares  of  both  micro  and \nsmall  enterprises  and  medium  enterprises  were  far  higher  than  the  legal  targets  of  6%  and  2% \nrespectively (Table 10). On average, the banks in this truncated sample increased the share of micro \nand small enterprises loans within their portfolio from an average of 15.8% in 2005 to 17.5% in 2010. \nThus the average lending institution (out of 130) was lending 3 times the targeted share for small and \nmedium enterprises. However, loans to medium firms were only slightly higher than targeted: in 2010, \nthe average bank lent 10% of their portfolio to medium firms. \n\n \nNonetheless,  there  is  considerable  dispersion  in  banks\u2019  decisions  to  lend  to  MSMEs. \nAlthough universal and commercial banks supplied the biggest amount of loans to MSMEs, their own \nloan portfolio reflected that lending to MSMEs were not their priorities. For these banks, the share of \nmicro  and  small  firms  in  their  loan  portfolios  ranged  from  1.7%  to  25.4%  in  2010,  while  the  share  of \nmedium firms ranged from 0.1% to 24.9%. It is noteworthy that the average UKB reported only 7.7% of \nloans to micro and small enterprises, which is below the Magna Carta target. \n\n \nMeanwhile, there is even greater dispersion in the portfolio decisions of the smaller thrift \nbanks  although  on  average  they  greatly  exceeded  the  Magna  Carta  targets.  The  average  thrift \nbank allotted 21.8% of its loans to micro and small firms (almost 3 times the target), and another 11% to \nmedium  firms  (over  5  times  the  target).  This  suggests  that  on  average,  the  focus  of  thrift  banks  was \nindeed the smaller firms.31 Nevertheless, the share of loans to micro and small firms ranged from 1.1% to \n88.2%,  while  that  of  medium  firms  ranged  from  0.2%  to  62.4%.  Clearly,  some  thrift  banks  were \nfocusing on micro and small firms, while some focused on larger firms. \n \n\nThe  trends  from  individual  banks  reporting  data  can  be  summarized  in  the  following  three \npoints. First, universal and commercial banks tend to not focus on MSMEs though they supplied the \nbulk  of  credits  to  MSMEs.  Second,  loans  to  medium  firms  were  much  higher  than  legally  mandated \nacross all banks. Third, there was a huge dispersion across banks in their optimal loan portfolio choices.  \n\n \nHow  many  banks  were  directly  complying  with  the  Magna  Carta  Law?  Our  panel  dataset  on \ncompliances  included  24  quarters  of  data  that  can  shed  some  light  on  the  dispersion  in  portfolio \nchoices (Table 11). We find that only 65.4% of all banks were complying directly on the target for micro \nand  small  enterprises  at  least  one  quarter.  In  other  words,  36.4%  of  banks  reported  at  least  one \nincident of undercompliance. Only 2.1% of all banks reported undercomplying with the target of direct \nlending  to  the  micro  and  small  enterprises  for  13  to  16  quarters  (more  than  half  of  all  the  periods \nobserved).  Another  5.5%  of  banks  reported  undercomplying  between  9  and  12  quarters.  More \nimportantly, the majority of banks reported overcomplying (and even supercomplying) with the micro \n\n                                                 \n31   Interestingly, the share of medium firms in the average thrift bank loan portfolio has decreased from 14% in 2005 to 11% in \n\n2010. \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   25 \n\nand  small  lending  targets  for  at  least  one  quarter.

In contrast, thrifts were \nmore likely to supercomply: two-thirds reported supercomplying for at least one quarter, and 20.2% of \n                                                 \n32   Overall, 72.8% of thrift banks reported zero instances of undercompliance.  \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   27 \n\nthe  thrifts  have  a  long-term  strategy  of  supercompliance  by  allocating  at  least  16%  of  their  loan \nportfolio  to  micro  and  small  enterprises  for  at  least  4  years  (>16  quarters).  This  is  double  the  legal \ntarget. On the other hand, less than 25% of all UKBs reported any instance of supercompliance, and \nnone consistently supercomplied for 4 years or more. \n \n\nRevealed  portfolio  allocation  of  loans  to  medium-sized  enterprises  was  more  similar  across \nbanks.  Approximately  13.3%  of  UKBs  and  16.1%  of  thrifts  reported  at  least  one  quarter  of \nundercompliance.  More  interestingly,  the  supercompliance  rate  was  higher  for  UKBs  than  thrifts. \nApproximately  40%  of  the  UKBs  supercomplied  for  at  least  4  years  compared  with  only  31%  of  the \nthrifts. This suggests that compared to the smaller thrift banks, some of the larger commercial banks \nmight have a comparative advantage in lending to medium firms. \n\n \nKernel  densities  of  distribution  of  banks\u2019  direct  lending  to  MSMEs  from  2005  to  2010  show \nclustering around the Magna Carta targets (Figure 8). The kernel density estimates, which are skewed to \nthe  right,  suggest  that  bank  financing  to  micro  and  small  enterprises  (for  most  banks)  comprise  only \nabout  10%  of  the  banks\u2019  loan  portfolios.  Compliance  to  the  medium  enterprise  provision  has  higher \ndensity  at  a  slightly  lower  ratio  of  compliance,  reflecting  the  lower  required  lending  to  medium \nenterprises as a ratio of the banks\u2019 loan portfolio. Figures 9 and 10 show the kernel density estimates of \nthe distribution of MSME loan allocations according to bank type, ownership, and across time. \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Kernel Density Estimates of MSME Loans,  \n2005\u20132010 \n\ns\ne\nt\na\nm\n\n \n\ni\nt\ns\ne\ny\nt\ni\ns\nn\ne\nD\n\n.08\n\n.06\n\n.04\n\n.02\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n40\nComp%\nkernel = epanechnikov, bandwidth = 2.0136\n\n20\n\n30\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n \nMSME = micro, small, and medium enterprise. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using data from the ADB SME Financing Survey. \n\nComp_small%\n\nComp_med%\n\n \n\n \n\nIn support of our earlier findings, kernel density estimates suggest that more thrifts were \nfocusing  on  lending  to  micro  and  small  enterprises  (Figure  9a).

Moreover, \nthe kernel density estimates for the thrifts and domestic-owned banks revealed their bigger exposures \nto  micro  and  small  enterprises  compared  with  UKBs  and  foreign  banks.

For the UKBs, we observe a modest shift to the right, suggesting that more banks \ncomply  within  the  8%\u201315%  range  from  2009  compared  with  the  earlier  periods.  Interestingly,  it  is \naround this period that the proposed amendment to the Magna Carta (i.e., increasing the legal target \nfrom  6% to  8%) was fully implemented.  Similar  shifts are observed in the  case of foreign bank MSE \nlending after 2008 with the tail extending further to the right, which may suggest increased lending to \nMSEs  by  foreign  banks.  The  data  also  reveals  a  modest  increase  in  the  density  estimate  around \ncompliance rates between 8% and 20% from 2008 along with a slight decrease between the 30%\u201360% \nrange in the case of thrifts.  \n\n \nFigure 10, which shows banks\u2019 lending to medium enterprises, suggest a slightly different story \nparticularly in the case of UKBs. Although the required lending to MEs is only set to 2%, the median \nshare of actual loans to medium enterprises are actually much higher than legally targeted. This is in \ncontrast with UKBs\u2019 MSE lending, where most banks\u2019 lending clustered near 10%, close to the imposed \nminimum  mandatory  credit  allocation  of  6%  (from  2005\u20132007)  and  8%  (from  2008\u20132010).  Figure \n10a.1 also shows modest improvement in UKBs\u2019 ME financing starting in 2008 (the distribution is less \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   29 \n\nskewed).  On  the  other  hand,  the  distribution  of  medium  enterprise  lending  for  thrifts  and  domestic \nbanks\u2019 became more concentrated and more skewed to the right beginning 2008. \n \n\nFigure 10: Distribution of Loan Allocation to Medium Enterprises, 2005\u20132010\n\na.

The  median  MSME  loan  share  by \nbank type, ownership, and location indicate that median portfolio share of micro and small firms for non-\nManila banks were consistently more than double that of lending institutions headquartered in the NCR. \nFurthermore, the median values of MSE financing are concentrated somewhere around the legal targets \nparticularly for UKBs and foreign banks, and that the shift may just be an indication of the increase in the \nrequired lending from 6% to 8% in 2008. We also observe an interesting development in loan to medium \nenterprises.  In  the  earlier  years,  thrifts,  domestic  banks  and  banks  headquartered  outside  the  National \nCapital  Region  reported  higher  median  share  of  medium  enterprise  loans.  Nonetheless,  this  median \nshare  has  been  generally  decreasing.  By  2009,  the  median  share  of  Manila-based  banks  actually \nsurpassed that of non-Manila based banks. Further, by 2010, the median share of medium enterprises in \nthe  loan  portfolio  of  UKBs  was  larger  than  that  for  thrifts.  This  suggests  that  new  technology  and  the \ninclusion  of  microenterprises  under  the  Magna  Carta  have  changed  the  equilibrium  and  comparative \nadvantages of various lending institutions and their target markets. \n \n\nThe  six  parts  of  Figure  12  further  illustrate  the  range  of  distribution  of  the  loan  share  of  small \nfirms across banks of different types, ownership, and geographic region over the period of study. From \n2005  to  2007,  at  least  75%  of  the  UKBs  directly  complying  with  the  Magna  Carta  lending  targets  for \nmicro and small enterprises, when the legal target was set at 6% (Figure 12 a.1). However, the percentage \nof UKBs that complied diminished from 2008. By 2010, we see though that the 25th percentile value of \nmicro and small enterprise loans returned to the same level  as in 2005. Nevertheless, this is around 6% \nor 2 percentage points shy from the required small firm financing after the Magna Carta was revised in \n2008. Only around 50% of the UKBs in the sample are able to comply by 2010. \n\n \nOn the other hand, at least 75% of thrifts in 2008 (and beyond) complied with the mandated \ncredit allocation of 8% to small enterprises. In fact, 50% of thrifts allotted almost 15% of their loans to \nmicro  and  small  firms,  despite  the  very  slight  downward  trend  in  the  median  share  after  2008. \nFurthermore,  a  quarter  of  the  thrifts  allotted  at  least  30%  of  their  loans  to  micro  and  small  firms \n(despite  the  dip  in  2009).  Most  importantly,  the  25th  percentile  loan  share  steadily  increased  from \n2005 to 2010 for thrifts \n\n \nFor  domestic  banks  as  a  whole  (including  UKBs  and  thrifts),  we  see  modest  increases  in  the \n25th  and  50th  percentile  values  of  loans  to  micro  and  small  enterprises.  We,  however,  observe  that \nafter  2007,  the  75th  percentile  value  declined.  This  suggests  a decrease  in  the  dispersion  of  optimal \nstrategies and allocation of loans to micro and small enterprises. \n\n \nInterestingly,  the  scenario  observed  in  domestic  banks  is  opposite  to  what  is  implied  by  the \ndata  of  foreign  banks,  which  saw  a  huge  increase  in  dispersion  in  their  optimal  allocation  of  loans  to \nsmaller firms (Figure 12 b.2). Beginning in 2007, we observe a decrease in the 25th percentile lending \nshare to smaller firms below the Magna Carta targets, accompanied by an increasing trend of foreign \nbanks\u2019  median  and  75th  percentile  loan  shares.  As  a  result,  the  dispersion  of  optimal  strategies  for \nforeign  banks  increased  considerably,  and  the  75th/25th  percentile  ratio  increased  significantly  from \n2005 to 2010.  \n \n \n \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   31 \n\nFigure 11: Median Values of Bank MSE and ME Firm Financing, 2005\u20132010 \n\na.1.

In the beginning of our study period, 2005, at least 75% \nof the foreign banks complied with the Magna Carta target of 6% for smaller firms. By the end of the \nstudy  period,  a  smaller  proportion  of  the  foreign  banks  complied  directly  with  the  legal  target  at  8% \nmandated in 2008. In a way, this suggests that the increase in the mandatory allocation to small firms \nmay  be  less  binding  for  foreign  banks.    As  substantiated  by  empirical  literature,  foreign  banks  have \nnumerous  disadvantages  relative  to  domestic  banks  when  it  comes  to  lending  to  small  firms \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   33 \n\n(e.g., personal ties, organizational structure, understanding of social dynamics, etc). In the case of the \nPhilippines,  these  disadvantage  could  have  been  further  limited  branches  and  affiliates  of  foreign \nbanks. Nevertheless, the data also  indicated an increasingly divergent set of optimal strategies and  a \nsorting  of  foreign  banks  into  those  that  figured  out  how  to  lend  to  smaller  firms  profitably,  against \nthose that could not. \n\n \nOn the other hand, although non-Manila based banks tend to lend more to smaller firms, \nthe  location  of  banks  headquarters  did  not  matter  as  much  in  terms  of  general  compliance  for \nthose at the 25th percentile.  For both groups the 25th percentile value increased in 2009. However, \nfor Manila-based banks the increase was just about enough to meet the new Magna Carta target, while \nfor  non-Manila  based  banks,  the  increase  was  significantly  above  the  target.  This  is  perhaps  not \nsurprising,  given  that  the  median  non-Manila  bank  allocate  over  20%  of  their  loans  to  smaller \nenterprises,  well  above  250%  of  the  legal  threshold.  However,  what  is  more  interesting  is  the \ndifferences  in  the  75th/25th  percentile  ratio:  for  Manila  banks,  the  2008  amendment  resulted  in  a \nnarrowed  dispersion  of  loan  shares,  while  for  non-Manila-based  banks,  the  75th  percentile  value \nincreased sharply to above 35%, thereby widening the dispersion of the loan allocation to smaller firms. \nThus, it could be that the inclusion of microenterprises in the coverage of the Law has increased the \ndirect  compliance  rates  for  non-Manila  banks.  By  2010,  at  least,  75%  of  these  banks  allot  at  least \napproximately 13% of their portfolio to micro and small enterprises.  \n\n \nAs we repeatedly saw, banks found it easier to comply with the Magna Carta targets for loans to \nmedium enterprises. Across the six groupings we examined, all had 25th percentile lending rate that was \nabove the legal target (Figure 13). We highlight two trends. First, the median lending of UKBs and foreign \nbanks  increased  over  time  in  contrast  to  thrifts  and  non-Manila-based  banks  where  median  lending \ndecreased. By the end of 2010, at least 75% of the UKBs allot at least 4% of their total loan portfolio to \nmedium firms\u2014more than double the Magna Carta minimum allocation of 2%. In addition, about 50% of \nforeign  banks  allotted  two  times  the  required  2%  mandatory  credit  allocation.  Banks  headquartered  in \nthe NCR, on the other hand, have more or less stable credit allocation to medium firms throughout the \nstudy period. The second point is that increasingly, there was a widening dispersion of optimal allocation \nof loans to medium firms by UKBs, while the dispersion decreased for every other group. \n\n \nTo  further  analyze  the  path  dependence  of  optimal  portfolio  allocation  for  bank  financing  in \nthe Philippines, we group the banks according to their financing behavior from 2005\u20132007. We define \nthe following variables: StartLow,  StartModerate, StartHigh,  and  StartVeryHigh. StartLow are the banks \nwhose  average  compliance  to  the  Magna  Carta  from  2005\u20132007,  separately,  are  below  the  25th \npercentile. StartModerate and StartHigh comprise the banks whose average lending from 2005\u20132007 \nare higher than the 25th percentile, but less than the median value and above the median but less than \nthe  75th  percentile,  respectively.  Finally,  StartVeryHigh  consists  of  banks  whose  average  lending \nbehavior  of  these  banks  through  time.  We  highlight  two  significant  changes  after  2007  that  may \npotentially affect small businesses financing: (i) the increased mandatory lending allocation to micro \nand small enterprises in 2008 and (ii) the global financial crisis from 2008\u20132009. \n\n \nWe  note  three  important  observations  from  Figure  14  depicting  the  median  values  of  bank \nsmall firm financing through time according to bank type, ownership, and geographic region. First, for \nbanks  that  started  low  and  moderate  (StartLow  and  StartModerate),  their  median  values  are  stable \n(slight  increases,  but  not  notable)  from  2005\u20132010,  with  the  exception  of  foreign  banks  and  banks \nheadquartered outside the NCR. Second, for banks that allotted a significant proportion of their loan \nportfolio to smaller firms from 2005\u20132007, we see a significant decrease in the median lending share \nafter  2007  for  these  group  of  banks  regardless  of  the  bank  type,  ownership,  and  geographic  region. \n\n \n\n\f34   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\nThird, we observe an increasing small firm financing trend for the foreign banks and Outside NCR for \nboth StartLow and StartModerate.  \n\nFigure 13: Percentile Values of Loans to Medium Enterprises, 2005\u20132010 \n\na.1.

First, although the total lending levels to MSMEs \nremained  fairly  stable,  the  percentage  shares  of  loans  allocated  to  MSMEs  declined  drastically  from \nabout 30% of total loans in 2002 to 16% of total loans in 2010. Second, banks are finding it harder to \nmeet the target for loans to smaller firms, especially after the target was revised upwards in 2008. The \nnew mandates resulted in a sharp increase in noncompliance in direct lending to micro and small firms, \nespecially amongst universal and commercial banks. Kernel density estimates suggest that the revision \nof  the  Magna  Carta  in  2008  was  binding  for  small  firm  lending  particularly  for  the  universal  and \ncommercial banks. Third, there is an increased dispersion in optimal loan portfolio across banks. Most \nsurprisingly, the absolute level of MSME lending by rural co-ops declined since 2008. \n \n\nLooking ahead, we see various developments recently could potentially further reduce banks\u2019 \nlending  to  MSMEs.  For  one,  the  implementation  of  the  new  Basel  3  framework,  which  raises  banks\u2019 \nminimum  financial  ratios  (e.g.,  Common  Equity  Tier  1  ratio,  Tier  1  ratio  and  capital  adequacy  ratio), \nintroduces  new  parameters  such  as  liquidity  coverage  ratio  and  net  stable  funding  ratio,  and  at  the \nsame time increases the risk weights of several asset items, could potentially siphon credit away from \nthe  MSME  sector.  These  include  the  implementation  of  the  Basel  3  parameters,  the  relaxation  of \nforeign investor participation in rural co-ops, the establishment of the long-awaited credit information \nbureau,  and  the  expansion  of  the  Credit  Surety  Fund  program  of  the  BSP.  There  appears  to  a \nconsensus that the new set of Basel 3 bank soundness criteria will have a dampening effect on MSME \nlending,  not  to  mention  that  the  BSP  just  announced  a  much  higher  set  of  ratios  than  what  were \nprescribed  by  Basel  3.  On  the  positive  side,  the  latter  three  developments  will  most  likely  boost \nMSMEs\u2019 bankability.   \n\n \nNonetheless, the BSP shows not only its willingness to adhere to the new set of standards but \ndirected Philippine banks to maintain financial ratios that are 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher than the \ninternational benchmarks (BSP Circular No. 781 of 2013). It stipulated that inclusive of conservation \nbuffer  of  2.5%  of  risk-weighted  assets,  banks  should  maintain  a  Common  Equity  Tier  1  ratio  of  8.5% \n(versus 7% in the B3F), a Tier 1 ratio of 10% (versus 8.5% in the B3F) and a capital adequacy ratio of \n12% (versus 10% in the B3F).  In the same circular it was noted that the new set of guidelines will be \neffective beginning 1 January 2014.33  \n\n \nAnother potential drag on MSME financing is the continued decline in the number of rural co-\nops (See box). A spate of bank closures has reduced the number of rural co-ops from 617 by end 2011 \nto 577 by the end of June 2013. This trend may not have a severe impact on the total value of loans by \nvirtue of the small size of rural co-ops relative to the entire banking sector. But, adverse effect could be \nfelt in terms of the number of MSME clients in the countryside that could lose access to formal credit \nand better served by rural co-ops prioritizing micro and small clients. \n\n \nOn  the  upside,  recognizing  the  challenges  faced  by  rural  banks,  the  government  passed  RA \n10574 on 24 May 2013 that effectively increased the allowable equity share of foreigners in rural banks \nfrom  40%  to  60%.  The  new  law,  which  amended  Sections  4  to  8  of  the  Rural  Bank  Act  of  1992 \n                                                 \n33   OECD (2012) argued that \u201cthe retail risk rating (75%) can be used to weight SME loans, provided the bank\u2019s portfolio is \ndiverse and the bank\u2019s loan to an SME borrower is less than EUR1 million.\u201d Nevertheless, it also noted that \u201cthe weighting \nsystem also favors many large enterprises over small ones: large companies with good external credit ratings (AAA) are \nassigned  a  20%  risk  weight,  whereas  SMEs  that  are  unrated  have  risk  weightings  of  100%  or  75%.  Under  Basel  III,  the \ndifference  in  core  Tier  1  capital  the  bank  needs  to  hold  against  their  loans  is  remarkable:  7%  of  the  loan  for  SMEs  with \n100% risk weighting, as opposed to 1.4% (7% \u00d7 20%) for a large company with an AAA rating.\u201d \n\n \n\n\f38   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n\n(RA 7353), sought to assist rural banks in meeting the capital requirements and put them \u201con a level \nplaying  field  with  its  thrift  and  commercial  banking  counterparts  that  are  able  to  take  in  foreign \npartners\u201d according to one of the bill\u2019s authors in the Senate (Macrohon 2013). \n \n\nThe prospect of having a fully functional credit information bureau by end of 2014 could also \nhelp  a  lot  in  improving  the  transparency  of  MSMEs\u2019  financial  standing.  Named  Credit  Information \nCorporation (CiC), the government-owned and controlled credit bureau was established courtesy of \nthe passage of the Credit Information System Act (RA 9510) on 31 October 2008. The implementing \nrules and regulations of RA 9510 were ironed out on 27 May 2009. However, it took more than 2 years \nbefore CiC started operating on 16 December 2011 and another 5 months before its board members \nwere  appointed  by  the  President.34 Recently,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  which  is  the \ngovernment  agency  taking  charge  in  setting  up  CiC,  announced  that  it  is  expecting  the  new  credit \nbureau to function fully in December 2014 (Dumlao 2013).  \n\n \nThe CiC, which will mainly target small businesses, is a public\u2013private partnership co-owned by \nthe government (60%) and the private sector (40%). As of November 2012, the private sector parties \nwith stakes in the corporation include the Philippine Cooperatives Center, Bankers Association of the \nPhilippines (BAP), Credit Card Association of the Philippines, Chamber of Thrift Banks, Rural Bankers \nAssociation  of  the  Philippines,  and  the  Philippine  Credit  Reporting  Alliance  (CiC  2012).  Note  that, \nprior  to  the  establishment  of  CiC,  two  credit  bureaus  have  been  created.  These  are  the  Credit \nInformation  Bureau  Inc.,  which  was  an  initiative  of  the  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  and  the \nFinancial  Executives  Institute  of  the  Philippines,  and  the  BAP  Credit  Bureau  set  up  by  the  BAP  in \n1991.35  However, the aforementioned two credit bureaus have largely confined their operations within \nlarge companies. \n \n\nThe  expansion  of  the  BSP\u2019s  Credit  Surety  Fund  program  is  an  additional  booster  to  MSME \nlending. From just one fund, the number of pooled resource financing vehicle rose to 27 by the end of \nMarch 2013. Since 2010, the approved loans increased fivefold from P134 million to P679.2 million by \nthe end of the first quarter of 2013. In the same  period, released loans increased over sixfold from  a \nlittle less than P82.2 million to P501.6 million.36 \n\n \n \n\nVI. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n \nDespite the Magna Carta and its subsequent revisions along with the accompanying support measures, \nbank lending to MSMEs has not increased much. More disconcertingly, MSME lending is generally on a \ndecline  as  a  ratio  of  banks\u2019  total  loan  portfolio.  A  substantial  drop  in  MSMEs\u2019  share  in  bank  loans  is \nparticularly  evident  among  UKBs.  Even  thrifts  and  rural  co-ops,  which  are  supposed  to  be  the  ones \nabsorbing  the  MSME  credit  demand,  have  likewise  reduced  their  lending  ratios  to  the  MSMEs  quite \nsignificantly from 2004 to 2010. Although nominal values show that lending by thrifts and rural co-ops \nto MSMEs are growing at a decent pace, it appears that their lending to other sectors are expanding \neven more briskly.  \n \n\nSmaller firms are impacted more than medium-sized firms with the ongoing migration of bank \nlending portfolio to non-MSME clients. UKBs as a group have already decreased their MSME lending \n\n                                                 \n34   See CiC Milestones: Historical Background and Timeline. \n35   The Central Bank of the Philippines was renamed Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in 1993 (See box). \n36   See BSP (2013b). \n\n\fAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   39 \n\nbelow the mandated 8% ratio. At the level of individual institutions, there is also a notable increase in \nthe  number  of  UKBs  not  complying  with  the  MSE  lending  provision  of  the  Magna  Carta.  In  other \nwords, it is more profitable for UKBs to pay the penalties rather than lend to MSEs.  \n\n \nOn  the  other  hand,  MSE  lending  of  thrifts  and  RCBs  continues  to  expand.  But,  lending  data \nillustrate that the share of MSEs in their credit disbursements has declined significantly although still \nwell  above  the  Magna  Carta\u2019s  required  ratio.  Further  research  would  be  required  to  understand  the \ndeterminants  of  this  pattern.  Nonetheless,  understanding  these  recent  changes  in  MSME  lending \npreferences  would  be  essential  in  crafting  future  financial  inclusion  programs.  On  a  positive  note, \nbank-level  data  suggest  that  more  thrifts  have  recently  become  more  compliant  to  MSE  lending \nrequirement.  \n \nWe  conjecture  that  perhaps  abolishing  the  Magna  Carta  targets  for  loans  to  medium-sized \nenterprises might not have much adverse effects. It is also notable that consistently, banks do not have \ntrouble complying with the mandated lending ratio for middle-sized firms. As of 2010, UKBs, thrifts and \nrural  co-ops  maintained  a  good  positive  margin  with  respect  to  the  legal  requirement  and \nnoncompliance  was  limited.  However,  the  steady  downward  trend  in  MSME  loan  allocation  across \nbank  groups  in  recent  years  cannot  be  overlooked.  This  trend  parallels  the  downward  drift  of  banks\u2019 \nlending ratio to micro and small firms explained above. The differences lie in the degree of the decline \n\u2014which is more muted in the case of lending to medium firms whereby the banks\u2019 allocation was still \nmuch higher than mandated by law. \n\n \nThe  overall  pattern  of  decreasing  share  of  bank  lending  to  MSMEs  thus  suggests  a  need  to \nrevisit, if not redesign, the current MSME lending policy framework. While the dynamism of the MSME \nsector  hinges  upon  having  reliable  access  to  financing,  banks  in  return  should  be  given  reasonable \nincentives  to  align  their  business  models  with  the  government\u2019s  social  agenda.  In  addition,  there  are \nways  to  increase  alternative  sources  of  credit  for  MSMEs,  such  as  developing  equities  and  bonds \nmarket  suitable  for  MSMEs.  The  government  could  also  further  improve  measures  to  increase \nfinancing supply by harnessing untapped domestic savings and foreign exchange reserves rather than \nrelying on a strict mandate on banks\u2019 portfolio allocation. Banks were finding it increasingly onerous to \ncomply  with  the  law  and  more  than  a  half  of  commercial  and  universal  banks  undercomplied  for  at \nleast  a  quarter  during  the  period  we  observed.  Expanding  alternative  means  of  financial  access  for \nMSMEs would be even more important given looming policy and institutional changes. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAPPENDIX \n\n \n\n \n\nQuarter \nQ1 2005 \nQ2 2005 \nQ3 2005 \nQ4 2005 \nQ1 2006 \nQ2 2006 \nQ3 2006 \nQ4 2006 \nQ1 2007 \nQ2 2007 \nQ3 2007 \nQ4 2007 \nQ1 2008 \nQ2 2008 \nQ3 2008 \nQ4 2008 \nQ1 2009 \nQ2 2009 \nQ3 2009 \nQ4 2009 \nQ1 2010 \nQ2 2010 \nQ3 2010 \nQ4 2010 \nQ1 2011 \nQ2 2011 \n\nTable A.1: Bank-Level Data for Universal and Commercial Banks \n \n\n \n\nData on Loans to Micro and Small Enterprises \n\nData on Loans to Medium Enterprises \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \n42 \n42 \n41 \n41 \n41 \n40 \n40 \n40 \n40 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n40 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \nwith Data \n40 \n40 \n39 \n39 \n40 \n39 \n38 \n38 \n38 \n37 \n32 \n31 \n30 \n30 \n29 \n29 \n30 \n27 \n27 \n26 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n27 \n27 \n29 \n\nNumber of \nNoncompliant \nBanks \n0 \n2 \n0 \n1 \n1 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n0 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n3 \n6 \n12 \n14 \n11 \n11 \n10 \n10 \n10 \n13 \n9 \n12 \n13 \n\nNumber of \nCompliant \nBanks \n40 \n38 \n39 \n38 \n39 \n39 \n36 \n36 \n36 \n37 \n31 \n28 \n26 \n27 \n23 \n17 \n16 \n16 \n16 \n16 \n16 \n17 \n15 \n18 \n15 \n16 \n\n \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \n42 \n42 \n41 \n41 \n41 \n40 \n40 \n40 \n40 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n40 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \nwith Data \n40 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n40 \n39 \n38 \n38 \n38 \n37 \n32 \n30 \n30 \n30 \n28 \n27 \n28 \n27 \n28 \n28 \n28 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n30 \n31 \n\nNumber of \nCompliant \nBanks \n40 \n39 \n39 \n38 \n40 \n39 \n38 \n38 \n36 \n37 \n31 \n30 \n30 \n29 \n27 \n24 \n25 \n25 \n26 \n25 \n26 \n26 \n27 \n27 \n26 \n27 \n\nNumber of \nNoncompliant \nBanks \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n1 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n2 \n3 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n4 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using the data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. \n\n\f  \n\nData on Loans to Micro and Small Enterprises \n\nData on Loans to Medium Enterprises \n\nTable A.2: Bank-Level Data for Thrifts\n \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \nwith \nData \n64 \n63 \n63 \n63 \n63 \n62 \n62 \n67 \n66 \n65 \n65 \n63 \n65 \n64 \n62 \n62 \n65 \n64 \n64 \n64 \n63 \n63 \n64 \n64 \n63 \n\nTotal \nNumber of \nBanks \n55 \n58 \n58 \n54 \n57 \n57 \n56 \n62 \n63 \n62 \n59 \n58 \n58 \n58 \n57 \n56 \n60 \n61 \n60 \n62 \n61 \n61 \n63 \n62 \n61 \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \nwith Data \n9 \n5 \n5 \n9 \n6 \n5 \n6 \n5 \n3 \n3 \n6 \n5 \n7 \n6 \n5 \n6 \n5 \n3 \n4 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n2 \n2 \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \n85 \n85 \n84 \n84 \n86 \n84 \n84 \n84 \n85 \n83 \n83 \n83 \n82 \n81 \n81 \n81 \n76 \n76 \n75 \n75 \n75 \n75 \n74 \n74 \n74 \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \nwith \nData \n60 \n59 \n60 \n59 \n59 \n59 \n61 \n66 \n66 \n65 \n64 \n62 \n64 \n62 \n60 \n59 \n63 \n60 \n62 \n63 \n62 \n63 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n\nTotal \nNumber of \nBanks \n55 \n53 \n55 \n53 \n56 \n54 \n56 \n63 \n64 \n63 \n62 \n59 \n61 \n59 \n58 \n56 \n60 \n58 \n61 \n61 \n60 \n59 \n59 \n59 \n59 \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \nwith Data \n5 \n6 \n5 \n6 \n3 \n5 \n5 \n3 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n2 \n2 \n4 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n\n42   |   Appendix  \n\nQuarter \nQ1 2005 \nQ2 2005 \nQ3 2005 \nQ4 2005 \nQ1 2006 \nQ2 2006 \nQ3 2006 \nQ4 2006 \nQ1 2007 \nQ2 2007 \nQ3 2007 \nQ4 2007 \nQ1 2008 \nQ2 2008 \nQ3 2008 \nQ4 2008 \nQ1 2009 \nQ2 2009 \nQ3 2009 \nQ4 2009 \nQ1 2010 \nQ2 2010 \nQ3 2010 \nQ4 2010 \nQ1 2011 \nQ2 2011 \n\nTotal \nNumber \nof Banks \n85 \n85 \n84 \n84 \n86 \n84 \n84 \n84 \n85 \n83 \n83 \n83 \n82 \n81 \n81 \n81 \n76 \n76 \n75 \n75 \n75 \n75 \n74 \n74 \n74 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using the data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n\n \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2004.

The paper highlights \nthree findings. First, although total lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) grew slightly, \nMSME loan shares declined drastically from 30% in 2002 to 16.4% in 2010. Second, there was a sharp rise \nin noncompliance after loan targets increased in 2008. Third, there is increased heterogeneity in optimal \nloan portfolio across banks. Most surprisingly, total MSME lending by rural and cooperative banks declined \nsince 2008. Abolishing Magna Carta target for medium-sized enterprise loans would most likely yield little \nadverse\u00a0effects.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to the majority of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\nASSeSSing MAnDAteD \n\nCreDit ProgrAMS: CASe \n\nStuDy of the MAgnA \n\nCArtA in the PhiliPPineS\n\nNiny Khor, Ryan Jacildo, and Ruth Tacneng\n\nno. 463\n\nnovember 2015\n\nadb economics\n\nworking paper series\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["\u00a0\n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ADB Economics Working Paper Series \n", " \nAssessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study \nof the Magna Carta in the Philippines \n \n \nNiny Khor, Ryan Jacildo, and Ruth Tacneng\n", " \n", "No. 463   |   November 2015 \n", "Niny Khor (nkhor@adb.org) is Economist at the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) PRC Resident Mission. \nRuth Tacneng (rtacneng@porto.ucp.pt) is Postdoctoral \nResearch Fellow at the CEGE and School of Economics \nand Management, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa. \nRyan Jacildo (ryan.jacildo@barcelonagse.eu) was a \nConsultant at the Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department, ADB. \n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", " \n", "\u00a0\n", "Asian Development Bank \n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City \n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines \nwww.adb.org \n", "\u00a9 2015 by Asian Development Bank \nNovember 2015 \nISSN 2313-6537 (Print), 2313-6545 (e-ISSN) \nPublication Stock No. WPS157764-2 \n", "The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views and policies of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) or its Board of Governors or the governments they represent. \n", "ADB  does  not  guarantee  the  accuracy  of  the  data  included  in  this  publication  and  accepts  no  responsibility  for  any \nconsequence of their use. \n", "By making any designation of or reference to a particular territory or geographic area, or by using the term \u201ccountry\u201d in this \ndocument, ADB does not intend to make any judgments as to the legal or other status of any territory or area. \n", "Notes:  \n1.\n2.
