The paper highlights \nthree findings. First, although total lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) grew slightly, \nMSME loan shares declined drastically from 30% in 2002 to 16.4% in 2010. Second, there was a sharp rise \nin noncompliance after loan targets increased in 2008. Third, there is increased heterogeneity in optimal \nloan portfolio across banks. Most surprisingly, total MSME lending by rural and cooperative banks declined \nsince 2008.

The final sample of 109 financial institutions represented over 90% of total \nfinance sector assets in the Philippines. We highlight three important findings.  First, although the total \nlending levels to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) grew slightly, the percentage shares of \nloans allocated to MSMEs declined drastically from a peak of 30% of total loans in 2002 to 16.4% in \n2010. Second, following the upwards revision of the loan target (from 6% to 8%) for smaller firms in \n2008, there was a sharp increase in noncompliance especially amongst universal and commercial \nbanks. Kernel density estimates suggest that the revision of the Magna Carta in 2008 was binding for \nsmall firm lending particularly for the universal and commercial banks. On the other hand, total loans \nto medium enterprises were still more than threefold larger than the targeted 2%. Third, there is an \nincreased heterogeneity in optimal loan portfolio across banks. Most surprisingly, the absolute level of \nMSME lending by rural and cooperative banks declined since 2008. Direct compliance amongst \nuniversal and commercial banks decreased beginning in the late 2007, while that of thrift banks \nincreased to almost 100%. Abolishing the Magna Carta targets for medium-sized enterprise loans \nwould most likely yield little adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION \n \nMicro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is the lifeblood of most economies. A vibrant MSME \nsector is essential in spreading the economy\u2019s wealth and income flows, creating more opportunities in \nthe countryside, maintaining social stability, and fostering inclusive economic growth. In this context, \naccess to finance is central to MSME development. Availability and cost of funds determine firms\u2019 \nability  to  compete  for  market  share,  innovate,  expand  and  withstand  business-related  stresses. \nHowever, since financial markets in most developing economies are largely underdeveloped with far \nfrom ideal regulatory frameworks, many governments in developing Asia have designed medium and \nlong-term MSME development plans, with the main goal of improving financing for MSMEs. \n \nIn the Philippines, one of the most important inclusive financing policies is the mandated credit \nprogram known as the MSME Magna Carta (Magna Carta) to improve financial access to MSMEs, \nwhich account for 99.6% of total firms and 61% of total employment in the Philippines. A recent study \nof the Philippines found that access to formal sector financing is indeed one of the key constraints that \nstrongly affect firms\u2019 dynamism (see Khor, Sebastian, and Aldaba 2013). At the same time, MSMEs do \nnot have easy access to the equities nor bonds market.   \n \nThe overarching objective of the Magna Carta legislation was to \u201cpromote, support, strengthen \nand encourage the growth and development of MSMEs in all productive sectors of the economy \nparticularly rural/agri-based enterprises.\u201d1 The Magna Carta was first enacted and implemented in 1991 \n(courtesy of Republic Act 6977)\u2014a time when the authorities were grappling for ways to resurrect an \nailing economy following a decade or so of tumultuous business climate. In the subsequent 20 years, \nthe law was amended twice to take into account the changes in the business and economic conditions. \n \nThe Magna Carta mandated banks to allot a certain portion (10%) of their loan portfolio to \nMSMEs. Although not explicitly mentioned, there are at least three good reasons why the regulation \nspecifically targeted banks. Firstly, banks hold the biggest stock of financial resources in the economy \namounting to over three quarters of the domestic financial resources. Secondly, banks do have the \nmost extensive network of offices among credit intermediaries. Lastly, banks are easier to monitor \nsince they regularly report their activities to the central bank. While there were questions raised on the \nrationale of the policy, Medalla and Ravallo (1997) argued that this kind of measure can be justified \nfrom a social standpoint since otherwise, banks are driven to channel funds to projects that generate \nhigh private returns but not necessarily social returns.  \n \nMandated credit program such as the Magna Carta is not unique to the Philippines. Lending \ntargets  set  for  priority  sectors,  including  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  are  imposed  in \ndeveloping economies such as Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The Magna Carta is also not \nthe first mandated credit provision imposed on Filipino banks. In 1974, the central bank directed banks \nto allot a portion of their loan portfolio to the agriculture sector via Circular No. 408.2 This central bank \nissuance eventually became known as the Agri-Agra Law (AAL) and continues to be an active \nregulation to date. 3 \n \n                                                 \n1   Republic Act No. 9501. Magna Carta for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). http://www.lawphil.net/ \nstatutes/repacts/ra2008/ra_9501_2008.html  \n2   This was a circular issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines, which was renamed Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in 1993. \n3   BSP Circular 736-2011 and the Agri-Agra Reform Credit Act of 2009 (RA 10000). ", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \nHow has the Magna Carta impacted banks\u2019 lending towards MSMEs? Surprisingly, literature \nassessing the implementation of the law and its economic impact is very limited. Medalla and Ravallo \n(1997) assessed the way banks responded to the AAL and the Magna Carta. The authors found out \nthat  between  1975  and  1996,  AAL  compliance  ratios  had  continuously  declined.  It  added  that \ncompounded annual growth (CAGR) of AAL loans during the period is roughly 3 percentage points \nlower than the CAGR of the banks\u2019 total loan portfolio. They also mentioned that until 1988, banks \nhave taken advantage of alternative compliance in the form of special series treasury bills that masked \nthe degree of decline in lending such that when it was removed, the drop in lending became very \napparent. The authors also noted that from 1991 to 1996, aggregate compliance ratios to the Magna \nCarta by bank type remained above what the law requires by a good margin. They just highlighted that \nforeign banks tend not to comply with the law on a consistent basis and are drawn toward alternative \ncompliance mechanisms rather investing directly in firms in spite of the general trend in the industry \nthat is skewed heavily on direct lending. \n \nFurthermore, little is known on the compliance with Magna Carta beyond 1996. This paper is \nthus undertaken to investigate the patterns of bank lending to MSME in the Philippines after the 2008 \nGlobal Financial Crisis and in conjunction to that, the compliance of banks to the Magna Carta lending \nprovisions post 1996. We will also attempt to shed light on the characteristics of banks base on their \nlending exposure to the MSMEs in terms of bank type, ownership, geographic region, and initial levels \nof compliance. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available study on MSME lending in the \nPhilippines from banks\u2019 perspective. \n \nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II briefly describes the domestic financial market \nconditions, the customary sources of credit of MSMEs in the Philippines and the government initiatives \nto boost MSME financing particularly the Magna Carta. Section III will layout the salient features of the \nlending provisions of the Magna Carta. Section IV will assess the trends of bank lending to MSMEs as \nwell as their compliance to the lending provisions of the Magna Carta using the datasets compiled by \nthe central bank of the Philippines, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) up to end of 2012. Section V will \nexplain recent developments that could potentially influence banks\u2019 lending behavior concerning \nMSMEs in the near term. Section VI will summarize the key findings of this paper. \n \n \nII.  FINANCING MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN THE PHILIPPINES \n \nA.  Definitions \n \nMSMEs in the Philippines are defined in two ways. The first definition is based on employment levels \nused by the National Statistics Office (NSO). The second definition is based on asset values used by \nthe BSP (Table 1). This presents a challenge when we examine data on MSMEs financing since there \nexists no harmonized supply and demand-side dataset. Credit demand-side data on firms are usually \nbased on employment clusters since these datasets (e.g., profile of MSMEs) are mostly compiled by \nthe NSO. On the other hand, credit supply-side data (e.g., lending of banks) are typically based on \nasset clusters defined by the BSP since reporting banks have to follow the BSP\u2019s framework. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   3 \nTable 1: Definitions of MSMEs in the Philippines\n \nNSO, Employment Level Range \nFirm Type  (number of employees)  BSP, Asset Size Range (P) \nMicro  1\u20139  <3,000,000\nSmall  10\u201399  3,000,001\u201315,000,000 \nMedium  100\u2013199  15,000,001\u2013100,000,000 \nLarge  >200  >100,000,00\nBSP = Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, MSME = micro, small, and medium enterprise, NSO = National Statistics Office.             \nSources: SMED Council Resolution No. 1 (2003); Republic Act 9501 (2008). \n \nMSMEs comprise almost all of the total number of firms in the Philippines.

Sources of Credit \n \nFirms\u2019 need for additional capital is typically addressed by (i) banks; (ii) bonds market; (iii) equities \nmarket;  (iv)  nonbank  lending  institutions  like  quasi  banks  and  investment  houses,  pawnshops, \nfinancing cooperatives, savings and loans associations, insurance companies, venture capitalists, and \nspecialized government lending corporations; and (v) informal sector players, such as family members, \nfriends, and unaccredited retail lenders. \n \nJust like in many developing economies, MSMEs in the Philippines have limited access to the \nequities market. MSMEs accounted for a mere 0.005% of total market capitalization by end of 2012, \nand are also not considered reputable enough to enter the bonds market.7 Other large scale credit \nsources like quasi banks, investment houses, and insurance companies typically also shy away from \nMSME clients while the role of venture capital firms remain quite small. Thus, given that access to \nformal financing is relatively scarce for MSMEs, capital options usually narrow to informal sectors, such \nas financing cooperatives, savings and loans associations, pawnshops, and informal sector lenders. \n \nAssessments  of  credit  provisions  suggest  that  MSMEs  depend  more  on  their  internally \ngenerated resources to bankroll their operations (Table 3), while formal financial institutions only \ncontribute somewhere between 11% and 21% of the MSMEs\u2019 capital utilization. The lack of reliable \nfinancial information from MSMEs leads to the perception of higher risk. In addition, lower expected \nprofitability, the absence of \u201cacceptable\u201d collateral by MSMEs, the lack of a national credit rating \nsystem for MSMEs contribute to the low loan releases from banks to the sector. \n \nTable 3:SMEs' Sources of Funding\n(% of current funding) \n \n   SERDEF-UP ISSI,  WBES,  ICPS-ADB,  PEP-IFC,  WBES, \n1992  2000  2004  2006  2009a \nOwn resources  78  52  60  69  76.4 \nBank loans  15  21  11  19  10.2 \nNonbank financial institution              0.9 \nInformal creditb  7  27  29  12  12.4 \nTotal  100  100  100  100  100 \nICPS-ADB = Investment Climate and Productivity Study, Asian Development Bank, PEP-IFC = Private Enterprise Partnership for the \nPhilippines (PEP-Philippines) SME Financing Survey, International Finance Corporation, SERDEF-UP ISSI = Small Enterprise Research and \nDevelopment Foundation-University of the Philippines  Institute for Small Scale Industries; SME = small and medium enterprise, WBES = \nWorld Bank Enterprise Survey. \na   Shares in the firms' working capital. \nb  Purchases on credit from suppliers/advances from customers + loans from moneylenders, friends, and relatives. \nSources: Nangia and Villancourt 2007; WBES 2009. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7   By the end of December 2012, the declared market capitalization of SMEs in the Philippine stock exchange is \nP586.4 million ($14.2 million) whereas the total market capitalization is P10.9 trillion ($265.3 billion).

The Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Magna Carta \n \nIn an effort to aid MSMEs with their credit needs, the Philippine authorities crafted a legislation that \nmandated banks to allocate 10% of their lending portfolio to MSMEs. The MSME Magna Carta, as it is \ncommonly known, also laid out a number of important parameters and measures in support of its main \nobjective. Some of these measures are as follows: \n \n(i)  It compartmentalized enterprises according to asset size and laid out a coordinated \nstructural support and safeguards system to enhance growth of enterprises classified \nunder micro, cottage, small, and medium; \n(ii)  It streamlined business procedures and requirements, made government services readily \navailable to businesses outside the centers of commerce, and \u201cincentivized\u201d financing to \nthe MSMEs; \n(iii)  It  created  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Council8 as  an  attached \nagency of the Department of Trade and Industry to carry out the objectives of the law \nand appointed the Bureau of Small and Medium Enterprises Development (BSMBD)9 as \nthe council secretariat; \n(iv)  It stipulated monetary and nonmonetary incentives and directed government banks (at \nthat time include the Philippine National Bank, the Development Bank of the Philippines \nand the Land Bank of the Philippines) to provide financing assistance to entrepreneurs \nunder these groups; and \n(v)  It created the Small Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation (SBGFC) to improve \nproduction operations and business network of firms, to provide financial services to \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (except  those  involved  in  trading  and  crop-level \nproduction) and develop alternative modes of financing and guarantee loans secured by \n\u201cqualified  SMEs.\u201d  The  SBGFC  and  the  Guarantee  Fund  for  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprises10 were merged in November 2001 to form the Small Business Corporation \n(SBC) to consolidate their resources.11 The new SBC and the much older Philippine \nExport-Import Credit Agency are presently the two main agencies charged to assist \nSMEs (which was later expanded to MSMEs) when it comes to their finances.12  \n \nThe Magna Carta specifically targeted banks given that they hold over 75% of total financial \nsector\u2019s assets in the Philippines. In addition, banks have an extensive network of offices and credit \nchannels and are administratively easier to monitor since banks have to regularly report their activities \nto the central bank. \n \nThe Magna Carta was amended twice (RA 6977 amended by RA 8289 and RA 9501) in an \neffort to make the legislation in tune with the changes in firms\u2019 needs and the economic conditions. In \n                                                 \n8   This agency was later renamed as the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Development Council (MSMEDC). \n9   This bureau was later renamed as Bureau of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (BMSMED). \n10   The Guarantee Fund for Small and Medium Enterprises was established in 1984 operated by the Livelihood Corporation \nattached to the office of the president tasked to provide guarantee services to participating financial institutions (PFIs) \nthat had been lending to SMEs. (ADB 2010) \n11   The agency which was put under the supervision of the central bank has a board comprised of representatives both from \nthe private sector and the public sector, namely the National Government, Land Bank of the Philippines, Development \nBank of the Philippines, Department of Trade and Industry, and Department of Finance (DOF). \n12   The Philippine Export-Import Credit Agency (PhilEXIM) was established in 1977 under the DOF, to pursue the policy of \nthe State \u201cto encourage and promote the expansion of Philippine exports and to establish a strong and credible export \ncredit institution, which shall be dedicated to the provision of export financing facilities and services to support the \ncountry\u2019s sector (See PhilEXIM\u2019s website). See also ADB (2005). \n ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \nparticular, the thresholds for asset-based enterprise classification were significantly adjusted in 1997 \nand 2002. The thresholds for micro and medium firms changed the most, approximately tripling \nbetween 1991 and 1997, and roughly doubling between 1997 and 2002 (Table 4). These variations \nwould prove to be very important to banks in their compliance to the mandated lending provision of \nthe law. The increased thresholds mean that their target market for MSMEs had also increased in size.  \n \nTable 4: Evolution of Asset-Based Definition of MSMEs  \n \nLaw/  Year  Micro  Cottage  Small  Medium  Large \nRegulation  Enacted      (P)     \nRA 6977  1991  <50,000  50,001\u2013 500,001\u2013 5,000,001\u2013 >20,000,000 \n500,000  5,000,000  20,000,000 \nRA 8289  1997  <1,500,001    1,500,001\u2013 15,000,001\u2013 >60,000,000 \n15,000,000  60,000,000 \nSMED Councila   2003  <3,000,000    3,000,001\u2013 15,000,001\u2013 >100,000,00 \n and RA 9501  2008  15,000,000  100,000,000 \nMSME = micro, small, and medium enterprise; RA = Republic Act; SMED = Small and Medium Enterprise Development. \na  Refers to SMED Council Resolution No. 1 (2003). \n \nIn addition, the coverage of the law and the statutory share of MSMEs in bank lending have \nalso changed over the years (Table 5). While the required ratio has fluctuated between 5% and 10% \nsince 1991, the mandated coverage has continually increased beyond small firms. The revision in 1997 \nextended coverage to medium firms. The law also recognized that medium firms are fundamentally \ndifferent from smaller firms, hence the establishments of two separate compliance rates for medium \nand smaller firms. By the last revision in 2008, the law was extended to cover microenterprises. While \nthe  2008  revision  also  further  distinguished  microenterprises  from  other  small  enterprises,  the \ncompliance rates for small and micro were still aggregated into the same category under the law. As of \nthe 2008 revision, the law mandates all banks to allocate 2% of their total loan portfolio to medium \nfirms, and a further 8% to micro and small firms. \n \nTable 5: Mandatory Share of MSME in Banks\u2019 Loan Portfolio \n \nYear  Share in Banks\u2019 Loan Portfolio  \nLaw  Enacted  Coverage (enterprises)  (years in effect) \nRA 6977       1991  Small  5% (1991); 10% (1992\u20131995); 5% \n(1996); 0% (1997) \nRA 8289       1997  Small and medium  Small: 6% (1997\u20132007)a \nMedium: 2% (1997\u20132007) \nRA 9501;       2008  Micro, small, and medium  Micro and Small: 8% (2008\u20132018) \nBSP Circular 625 (2008)  Medium: 2% (2008\u20132018)a \nBSP = Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; MSME = micro, small, and medium enterprise; RA = Republic Act. \na   RA 8289 should have ended in May 2007 but implementation of the lending provision was extended until early December 2008  \n(BSP Circular Letter 2007-039) because the BSP issued circular 625-2008 pursuant to RA 9501 only on 14 October 2008, which \nbecame effective 15 days after it was published on 20 October 2008.  \n \nIn the present form of the law, firms considered eligible to be covered by the law have to satisfy \nthe following four conditions. First, firms need to be registered with the appropriate agencies as \npresently provided by law. Second, firms should be fully (100%) owned, capitalized by Filipino citizens, \nwhether single proprietorship or partnership. If the enterprise is a juridical entity, at least 60% of its \ncapital or outstanding stocks must be owned by Filipino citizens. Third, firms should be participating in \na business activity within the major sectors of the economy, namely, industry, trade, services, including ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   7 \nthe practice of one\u2019s profession, the operation of tourism-related establishments, and agribusiness. \nLastly, eligible firms are those that are not a branch, subsidiary or division of larger scale enterprises.13 \n \nD.  Other Initiatives to Encourage Lending to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises \n \nTo keep bank funds flowing steadily to the MSME sector, the BSP also instituted a number of measures \nto compensate lending institutions for the burden brought about by the Magna Carta.14 These include:  \n \n(i)  Allowing the establishment of microfinance-oriented thrift banks and rural banks as an \nexemption from branching moratorium (Circular No. 273 dated February 27, 2001); \n(ii)  Exemption of microfinance loans from normal documentation applicable to regular bank \nloans (Circular No. 273 dated February 27, 2001);  \n(iii)  Reduction of the reserve requirements on thrift banks and rural banks which deal with \nSMEs and small borrowers (Circular No. 363 dated December 3, 2002); \n(iv)  Reduction  of  the  risk  weight  applicable  to  qualified  SMEs  and  microfinance  loan \nportfolios from 100% to 75% subject to certain conditions (Circular No. 364 dated 9 \nJanuary 2003), such as performance and financial soundness of the bank and adequacy \nof risk management system; \n(v)  Exemption of SME loans without latest income tax returns and/or audited financial \nstatements from \u201cLoans Especially Mentioned\u201d classification provided said loans are \ncurrent, have not been restructured, and are supported by income tax return and/or \naudited financial statement at the time they were granted; \n(vi)  Deferment, for a period of 1 year, of the implementation of the market-based pricing \nmechanism for rediscount loans below the 91-day Treasury bill rate to help jumpstart \nSME lending; and \n(vii)  Approval of the 12-point accreditation guidelines for rural and thrift banks and the \nlending features of short- and long-term loans for direct or retail lending by participating \ngovernment financial institutions under the SME Unified Lending Opportunities for \nNational Growth (SULONG). \n \nThe government also focused on aspects that would make banking nonlarge firms appealing to \nthe creditor, such as (ii) establishing an effective loan guarantee system, (i) finding ways to deal with \ncollateral requirement issues, (iii) creating a public credit bureau, (iv) developing more appropriate \nways to assess risk associated with lending to SMEs, and (v) optimizing the network of state-owned \nfirms in delivering services to SMEs.  \n \nIn order to alleviate information gaps, one important solution considered by both regulators \nand financial institutions is the creation of a reliable credit scoring system to assess the credit viability \nof firms that can be used by the entire banking system. Notably, according to an ADB report (2004), \n\u201cSBC\u2019s management has discovered (as have many other lenders in many places) that there is no clear \ncorrelation between the kind and quality of collateral offered to a lender and loan default. This implies \nthat loan underwriting techniques that do not rely on traditional collateral are highly relevant in the \nPhilippines.\u201d \n \n                                                 \n13   \u201cThis requirement shall not preclude MSMEs from accepting subcontracts and entering into franchise partnership with \nlarge enterprises or from joining in cooperative activities with other MSME\u201d (RA 9501). \n14   BSP Media Release (2 February 2004). \n ", "8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \nTo further strengthen its overall approach to facilitate financing for SMEs, the government \nimplemented the SME Unified Lending Opportunities for National Growth (SULONG) program. The \nSULONG program, launched in 2003, essentially sought to provide SMEs alternative credit sources \nthrough participating government financial institutions.15 The general objectives of the program were \nto: (i) simplify and standardize the lending procedures, (ii) reduce documentary requirements and \nexpedite procedures, (iii) provide SMEs greater access to short- and long-term funds, and (iv) lower \nthe effective cost of borrowing by SMEs and liberalize the requirement.16 \n \nFinally, the BSP also rolled out the Credit Surety Fund program on 2 July 2008. The rationale of \nthis fund is \u201cto increase the credit worthiness MSMEs that are experiencing difficulty in obtaining loans \nfrom banks due to lack of acceptable collaterals, credit knowledge and credit track records\u201d (BSP, \n2013b). Essentially, the Credit Surety Fund can serve as: (i) an alternative to acceptable collaterals, \n(ii) security for loans of MSMEs that are members of a cooperative, and (iii) an assurance for payment \nof bank loans. Investors in the fund are comprised of cooperatives, nongovernment organizations, local \ngovernment units, banks (e.g., Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines, and \nIndustrial Guarantee and Loan Fund), donors, and the BSP. Eligible borrowers include MSMEs who are \nmembers of cooperatives and who have businesses that meet certain conditions.17 \n \nE.  The Structure of the Banking Industry in the Philippines \n \nThe banking industry in the Philippines forms the core of the financial system in the Philippines. By end \nof  2012,  banks  hold  80%  of  the  approximately  P10  trillion  of  total  domestic  financial  assets.18 \nNonbanks, which include investment houses and companies, finance companies, securities dealers \nand brokers, pawnshops, lending investors, nonstock savings and loan associations, venture capital \ncorporations, private and government insurance companies, and credit card companies accounted for \nthe remaining 20%. For the last 3 decades this distribution hardly changed, despite a fivefold growth in \ntotal financial assets from 1990 to 2000, and another 2.5-fold growth from 2000 to 2012 (Table 6). \nTable 6: Total Resources of the Philippine Financial System  \n(P billion) \n \nYear  Total  UKBa  THBb  RCB  Total Banks  Nonbanksc \n1970  18.8  17.2  0.9  0.7  18.8 \n1980  248.1  172.6  10.6  5.6  188.8  59.3 \n1990  800.2  558.2  37.6  13.9  609.7  190.5 \n2000  4,077.9  3,013.6  245.8  67.4  3,326.7  751.1 \n2010  9,046.3  6,423.7  626.4  180.1  7,230.2  1,816.1 \n2012  10,516.2  7,486.7  681.6  190.1  8,358.3  2,157.8 \nRCB = rural and cooperative bank, THB = thrift bank, UKB = universal and commercial bank.  \na  Includes specialized government banks. \nb   Includes savings and mortgage banks, private development banks, and stock savings and loan associations. \nc   Includes investment houses, finance companies, investment  companies, securities dealers/brokers, pawnshops, lending investors, \nnonstock savings and loan associations., venture capital corporations, credit card companies, which are under BSP supervision, and \nprivate and government insurance companies (e.g., Social Security System and Government Service Insurance System). \nSource: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. \n                                                 \n15   These include the Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines, Small Business Guarantee \nCorporation, and the Social Security System. \n16   Both the Development Bank of the Philippines and Land Bank of the Philippines are part of the SULONG program. \n17   See BSP (2013c) for the details. \n18   This is approximately equivalent of $250.4 billion, based on the exchange rate of P42 per US dollar. ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   9 \nOverall, banks in the Philippines are supervised by the BSP as prescribed by the General \nBanking Law passed in 2000 (also known as RA 8791). The law also classified banks in the Philippines \nas universal banks, commercial banks, thrift banks, rural and cooperative banks, or Islamic banks. The \nMonetary Board, which is the decision-making body of the central bank, may also create another type \nof bank if the need arises. The minimum capitalizations are highest for universal banks (P4.95 billion), \nfollowed by commercial banks (P2.4 billion), thrift banks (P1 billion for those headquartered in Manila \nand P250 million for others). The minimum capital requirement for rural banks and cooperatives are \nmuch lower, ranging from P100 million for those headquartered in Manila to below P5 million for those \nbased in rural 5th\u20136th class municipalities (Table 7). In our subsequent analysis, we group all these \ninstitutions into three broad groups: universal and commercial banks (UKBs), thrift banks (THBs or \nthrifts), and rural and cooperative banks (RCBs or rural co-ops). The average UKB has approximately \n20 times the assets of the average thrift bank, which in turn has average total assets 20 times the \naverage rural and cooperative banks. \n \nTable 7: Minimum Capitalization Requirement by Bank Type in the Philippines \n \nMinimum Capitalization Additional Major Statutes aside from \nBank Type  P billion   $ milliona  the General Banking Law \nUniversalb, e  4.95  120.17 \nCommercialc, e   2.40  58.26 \nThriftd  Thrift Banks Act (RA 7906) \nHead Office: \nMetro Manila  1.00  24.28 \nCities of Cebu and Davao  0.50  12.14 \nOther areas  0.25  6.07 \nRural  Rural Banks Act (RA 7353) \nHead Office: \nMetro Manila  0.10  2.43 \nCities of Cebu and Davao  0.05  1.21 \nOther cities  0.025  0.61 \n1st\u20134th class municipalities  0.01  0.24 \n5th\u20136th class municipalities  0.005  0.12 \nCooperative  0.010  0.24  Cooperative Code (RA 6938) \nRA = Republic Act. \na   2012 end-of-period P/$ exchange rate is 41.1920. \nb   Includes Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines (AAIB), which is the only Islamic Bank in the country at present. \nAAIB is governed by its own charter, i.e., Charter of Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines (RA 6848). \nc   Includes specialized government banks. \nd   Includes savings and mortgage banks, private development banks, and stock savings and loan associations. \ne   See General Banking Law of 2000 for the features delineating universal and commercial banks.

All of the 37 UKBs accounted altogether for \n89.4% of total banking assets, 86.3% of total loans, 88.6% of total deposits, as well as 54.7% of total \n ", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \nbank offices around the country.

Based on the Manual of Regulations for Banks of 2011 (Sec. X330), the \ngeneral principle is that \"the total outstanding loans, other credit accommodations and guarantees to each of the bank\u2019s \nDOSRI shall be limited to an amount equivalent to their respective unencumbered deposits and book value of their paid-\nin capital contribution in the bank: Provided, however, that unsecured loans, other credit accommodations and guarantees \nto each of the bank\u2019s DOSRI shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of their respective total loans, other credit \naccommodations and guarantees.\" ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   11 \nLastly, the thrift banks, some of which were large enough to compete with universal and commercial \nbanks  for  big  borrowers,  normally  focus  on  small  and  medium  enterprises  in  metropolitan  and \nprovincial business centers left unaddressed by the UKBs. It is also important to note that a number of \nmajor thrift banks are likewise either affiliates of UKBs or financial arms of big holding companies. \n \nA Brief Political-Economic History of the Philippine Banking Industry \n \nPrior to extensive structural changes in the last 2 decades, the government has played the role of the primordial driver of \nthe banking sector (as is the case with other key sectors such as aviation, telecommunication, water, power, etc.).a \nHowever, political intrusion leading to regulatory lapses and poor oversight had resulted in an unstable industry growth \npath and severely impacted the government\u2019s coffers. The local banking system barely escaped collapse in the 1970s and \nthe early part of 1980s.b The banking crisis of the 1980s was particularly remarkable since it led to the insolvencies of two \nlarge investment houses, three commercial banks (including two of the largest banks in the country that are state-owned), \nand 160 rural and thrift banks (Nascimento 1990).c \n \nIn 1984 and 1985, a series of difficult economic episodes crippled the domestic capital market and eventually caused the \neconomy to contract.d Capital infusion by the national government kept the banking system afloat while a standby credit \narrangement with the International Monetary Fund was needed to restore the credibility of the country in the international \nfinancial network\u2014mainly in terms of availability of foreign reserves, albeit at a huge cost to the public (Nascimento 1990, \nDohner and Intal, Jr. 1989). Subsequently, the process of reforming the entire industry forced the government to sell to the \nprivate sector a substantial amount of its shares in two major banks.e Reform measures also compelled the restructuring \nand recapitalization of the central bank that itself went bankrupt.f \nAs conditions improved, further liberalization measures were carried out in the first half of 1990s involving entry of foreign \nbanks, bank branching regulations, and foreign exchange transactions. The easing of restrictions resulted in a more fluid \nmovement of capital and, accordingly, a sharp rise in the number of branches in a very short time (See box figure). \nNonetheless, the number of banks declined marginally due to continuous market consolidation especially in the rural and \ncooperative banks segment (Pasadilla and Milo 2005).  \n \nBanking Institutions and Branches, 1970\u20132012 \n \n                                        a.

Although the local banking system generally proved to be resilient, the credit crunch and the very steep \ncurrency revaluation caused some small banks to fail. Systemwide nonperforming loans also inched up considerably from \n2.6% in 1996 to 17.6% midway in 2002. Uncertainties over the length and depth of the impact of the crisis on the local \nbanks have also pushed monetary authorities to operate at very restrictive mode.g \n \nIn 2000, a new central bank charter was passed into law largely to strengthen the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 (BSP) \nsupervisory and oversight functions as well as to improve its crisis response toolkit. In a nutshell, the General Banking Law \n(RA 8791), as it is more commonly known, granted the BSP the authority to oversee and administer compliance of banks \nto applicable laws and regulations, inquire into the solvency and liquidity of financial institutions (e.g., foreign and local \nbanks, quasibanks, and trust entities, and other types of banks), enforce prompt corrective action, determine policy \ndirection in the areas of money, banking and credit, and to the extent feasible, ensure compliance to the internationally \naccepted standards, including of the Bank for International Settlements. \n \nRestrictions were gradually relaxed as ill-effects of the regional financial turmoil started to wane and as macro and \nmicroprudential measures that were erected began to deepen their roots. Banks have likewise become more careful in \nmanaging risks in the years following the Asian financial crisis.h Thus, in contrast to the severe impacts of the Asian \nfinancial crisis, the recent global financial crisis made a much smaller dent on the books of the banks.i Such display of \nfinancial resilience gave the BSP a much bigger policy room to maneuver without having to take draconian measures in \norder to keep the spillovers in check. Instead, the central bank opted for a series of policy rate adjustments and a 2 \npercentage point cut in the statutory reserve requirement to ensure that the system remains liquid.j In 2011, the BSP \nlikewise removed the last of the branching regulation put in place 12 years earlier to create a more accommodative \nregulatory structure.k \n \na   The Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) alone (both state-owned banks at that time) held nearly \n50% of the banking sector\u2019s assets before they became insolvent in 1985 (Gochoco-Bautista 1999). \nb    \u201cAfter a long era of political intrusion under the Marcos regime, there is a principal\u2013agent problem as regulators and supervisors may \nnot be operating in the public interest. Meanwhile, private banks belong to business conglomerates and do not act tough on affiliated \ncompanies since they can expect financial assistance from BSP,\u201d (Nasution 1999). \nc   According to Gochoco-Baustista (1999), the Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which are \nboth government controlled at that time, were declared insolvent owing largely to excessive lending to DOSRI. Nascimento (1990) \nnoted that on top of the economy-related factors, what happened to DPB and PNB was a reflection of politically motivated loans \ngranted sometime in the 1970s until the early 1980s, poor internal controls, auditing, and lending standards, and the decision to take \nover troubled corporations. The government assumed the liabilities of both banks and PNB was eventually privatized. \nd   The value of the Philippine peso was cut by more than 50% within 2 years. Inflation ranged between 33% and 63%, which lasted for \nabout a year.

PNB was the biggest bank in the country at that time in terms of assets. \nf   The Central Bank of the Philippines itself became bankrupt mainly due to the assumption of foreign liabilities and other quasifiscal \nactivities (Singson 1999).

COMPLIANCE TO THE MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE MAGNA CARTA \n \nA.  Direct Compliance \n \nThe most important part of the MSME Magna Carta is the legal mandate for mandatory credit \nallocation (as laid out under Rule 13) that all lending institutions have to set aside 8% of their total loan \nportfolio for micro and small enterprises (MSEs), and a further 2% for medium enterprises (MEs). The \nBSP  allows  banks  various  channels  to  comply  with  the  mandatory  credit  allocation  for  MSMEs. \nBasically, these can be divided into two categories namely, the direct compliance and the indirect \ncompliance. As stipulated in BSP Circular 625 issued in 2008, ways to comply directly are enumerated \nbelow, and vary across the targeted firm size. \n \nFor micro and small enterprises: \n \n(i)  Actual  extension  of  loans  to  eligible  MSEs,  other  than  to  Barangay  Microbusiness \nEnterprises (BMBEs) which are covered in Item \u201cc(3)\u201d hereof:21  Provided, however, that \nloans granted to MSEs other than BMBEs, to the extent funded by wholesale lending of, \nor  rediscounted  with,  another  bank  shall  not  be  eligible  as  compliance  with  the \nmandatory credit allocation; or \n(ii)  Loans granted to export, import, and domestic micro and small scale traders, other than \nto BMBEs which are covered in Item \u201cc(3)\u201d hereof:  Provided, however, that loans \ngranted to MSEs other than BMBEs, to the extent funded by wholesale lending of, or \nrediscounted with, another bank shall not be eligible as compliance with the mandatory \ncredit allocation; or \n(iii)  Purchase of eligible MSE loans listed in Items \u201cc(1)\u201d and \u201cc(2)\u201d on a \u201cwithout recourse\u201d \nbasis from other banks and financial institutions;22 or \n(iv)  Purchase/discount on a \u201cwith or without recourse\u201d basis of MSE receivables, other than \nBMBE receivables which are covered in Item \u201cc(3)\u201d hereof; or \n(v)  Wholesale lending or rediscounting facility granted to participating financial institutions \n(PFIs) for on-lending to MSEs, other than to BMBEs which are covered in Item \u201cc(3)\u201d \nhereof; or \n(vi)  Wholesale lending or rediscounting facility granted to PFIs for on-lending to export, \nimport, and domestic micro and small scale traders, other than to BMBEs which are \ncovered in Item \u201cc(3)\u201d hereof; or \n(vii)  Commercial letters of credit outstanding, net of margin deposits, issued for the account \nof MSEs. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n21  Item c(3) under subsection X342.3 (Eligible credit exposures) of the BSP Manual of Regulations for Bank (MORB) 2008  \nstipulates the mechanisms considered as \u201cAlternative compliance for either or both MSEs or/and MEs.\" The provision \nclassifies \u201cLoans from whatever sources granted to BMBEs as provided under Subsection X365.5\u201d as a form of alternative \ncompliance.

Alternative Compliance \n \nAcknowledging the difficulty and the risks of lending to fledgling enterprises early on, the government \nhas established a set of alternative vehicles in order to comply with the MSME lending provisions of \nthe Magna Carta. \n \nAlternative compliance for either or both MSEs or/and MEs are allowed on the following \ngrounds: first through paid subscription or purchase of liability instruments offered by the SBC, \nthrough paid subscription of preferred shares of stock of the SBC, or through loans (irrespective of \nsources) granted to Barangay Microbusiness Enterprises.23 \n \nEarlier, banks can also set aside special accounts consisting of cash or \u201cdue from BSP\u201d for \nMSMEs    which  are  free,  unencumbered,  not  hypothecated,  not  utilized  or  earmarked  for  other \npurposes and include the corresponding amounts to their compliance reports as per BSP Circular 147 \n(1997). But this was no longer included as a mode of compliance under the new Magna Carta (RA \n9501) beginning from 2008. \n \nC.  Penalty for Noncompliance \n \nIn case of noncompliance, the current penalty is relatively lenient compared with the previous versions \nof Magna Carta law.  Under initial versions of the law, noncompliant banks are fined by an amount no \nless than P500,000 and other officers of the erring lending institutions shall be individually liable for \nimprisonment of not less than 6 months.24 The subsequent revision of the law in 1997 extended the \nloan earmarking program for SMEs to 2007, and dropped imprisonment provision while maintaining \nthe monetary fine (Table 5).25 \n \nThe monetary penalty for noncompliance varied according to bank types though the amount \nwas miniscule compared to the average banking assets of these institutions.

ASSESSING BANK COMPLIANCE TO THE MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM  \nENTERPRISE MAGNA CARTA \n \nGiven the low levels of penalty meted out to those who did not comply with the MSME Magna Carta, it \nis interesting to assess actual bank compliance to the law. This section intends to shed light on the \nlevels and trends of bank lending to MSMEs in the Philippines and to assess banks\u2019 compliance to the \nMagna Carta. We proceed in two steps. First we provide an industry-level analysis, which examines the \noverall aggregate MSMEs lending activity of banks as a group. Second we use bank-level data to \nanalyze patterns of compliance to the Magna Carta for MSMEs by individual universal and commercial \nbanks, and thrift banks.  \n \nA.  Data Sources \n \nFor the industry aggregate-level analysis, we used the data on banking industry\u2019s lending to MSMEs \nprovided by the BSP. The data series present information about the compliance to the Magna Carta for \n ", "16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \nMSMEs of the three major bank types (UKBs, thrifts, and rural co-ops) covering the years from 1999 to \n2010. Moreover, the data show the disaggregation of the MSME compliance to the Magna Carta \naccording to type of compliance; in other words, we know whether the banks complied through direct \ncompliance, indirect compliance, or \u201cfunds set aside for MSMEs.\u201d26 However, as mentioned earlier, \nfunds set aside for MSMEs are no longer considered as mode of compliance beginning 2008.  \n \nTo assess compliance at the bank-level, we compiled a comprehensive panel dataset from the \nPublished Statements of Condition of each lending institution posted on the BSP\u2019s website. The data \nseries covers periods from the first quarter of 2005 to the second quarter of 2011 but limited to UKBs \nand thrifts because the BSP does not post the compliance information for individual rural co-ops. \nWhile  these  published  statements  comprised  the  most  complete  data  publicly  available  on  the \ncompliance patterns of financial institutions, we note two caveats pertaining to the quality of data. \nFirstly, the format of the compliance ratios in these published statements (i.e., whether in percentage \nor absolute terms) is not consistent across reports.  Some information do not appear meaningful (e.g., \ncompliance ratios that are over 100%). Thus, caution was exercised in building the panel dataset of \ncompliance ratios. Secondly, a number of banks do not report their Magna Carta compliance ratios in \nsome of their public statements. Hence, we need to distinguish zero lending to MSMEs from absence \nof data. The summary statistics are given in Tables 1 and 2 in the Appendix. Nevertheless, our \npostcleaning final sample with complete data consists of 109 financial institutions (out of an initial \nsample of 136), which altogether represented over 90% of the finance sector assets in the Philippines.  \n \nB.  Descriptive Statistics of Aggregate Lending \n \nThe outstanding amount lent by all lending institutions to MSMEs increased modestly from 1990 \nto 2010 (Figure 1). Financing to MSMEs rose from P248.2 billion to P308.5 billion in those 12 years, \nrepresenting a growth rate of roughly 24.3% during the period or 2.32% per year growth. UKBs provide \nthe lion\u2019s share of the loan provisions, accounting for 72.9% of the total credit lines in 2010 (which is a \ndecrease from their market share of 83.7% in 1999). THBs, on the other hand, saw their share of MSME \nlending rising from 13% in 1999 to 19.8% in 2010. The strongest growth in market share is observed for \nRCBs, which tripled their share of MSME financing from below 3.3% in 1999 to12.6% in 2009, before \nretreating to just above 7.3% by the end of 2010.  \n \nThe  decline  in  UKBs\u2019  market  share  is  brought  about  by  the  tepid  growth  in  its  lending \noperations between 1999 and 2010, which saw a compounded annual growth rate of only 0.72%. \nThrifts, on their part, were more aggressive in attending to MSMEs capital needs, registering 7% \naverage loan growth during the 11-year span. Meanwhile, RCBs have been the most aggressive in \ncapturing MSMEs\u2019 credit demands, growing its exposure by 20% annually until 2008 until a pullback \nbeginning in 2009. In 2009, total MSME lending by rural co-ops declined by 1.4%, and then contracted \nsharply in 2010 by 41.9%.27  \n \nBetween  1990  and  2010,  the  growth  in  MSME  lending  could  be  (almost)  entirely \nattributed  to  the  growth  in  lending  to  medium  enterprises  (Figure  2). Outstanding loans to \nmedium enterprises increased by almost 50% from P100.1 billion in 1999 to P149.4 billion in 2010 \n                                                 \n26   The \u201cfunds set aside for MSMEs\u201d is defined by the BSP (as indicated in the data file) as the item consisting of either Cash \non Hand and Due from BSP which are free, unencumbered, not hypothecated, not utilized or earmarked for other \npurposes. The Due from BSP is a special account deposited with the BSP and does not form part of the bank's legal \nreserves. Under the new mandatory credit allocation (RA 9501). \n27   The compounded annual growth rate of MSME lending for thrifts was 6%. In contrast, the compounded annual growth \nrate for RCBs was 19.3% from 1998 to 2008 and fell to 9.8% by the end of 2010. ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   17 \n(representing a CAGR of 3.7%). UKBs provided approximately slightly 80% of total loans to medium \nenterprises during this period.

Rural co-ops have also increased their market share, from only 4.5% in 1999 \nto 19.8% by the end of 2008. Nevertheless, due to the contraction in their lending in 2010, their market \nshare slipped to just 10.5% by the end of 2010. \n \nThough the recent trends favor larger firms, historically the majority of MSME loans has \ngone toward micro and small firms.

Thrifts increased their loans to both segments of the MSMEs during the period: increasing \nlending to micro and small firms from P17.8 billion to P38.9 billion (compounded growth rate of 7.4%) \nand that to medium firms from P84.2 billion to P121.5 billion (compounded growth rate of 3.9%). \nAmong the various lending institutions, rural co-ops\u2019 lending to MSMEs grew the most. Their loans to \nmicro and small firms increased fivefold from P6.6 billion in 1999 to P32.4 billion in 2008, although it \nwas halved in the next 2 years to P16.8 billion. Similarly, their loans to medium firms increased more \nthan sevenfold from P1.4 billion in 199 to P9.3 billion in 2009, before scaling back to P5.9 billion. Thus, \nin spite of the sharp downturns between 2009 and 2010, the rural co-ops still registered a strong 11.3% \nannual growth rate in their lending to micro and small enterprises and an average lending growth rate \nof 16.3% for medium enterprises throughout the 11-year period. \n \nC   Aggregate Direct Lending to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises \n \nThe aggregate data reveals two important trends. Firstly, despite the increase in total lending \nvolume, the share of MSMEs in the banking sector\u2019s lending portfolio has declined significantly \nsince 2002. Secondly, despite the decreasing share in MSME loans, aggregate lending to the \nMSME sector still far exceeds the explicit 10% goal of the Magna Carta. At the peak in 2002, \nMSMEs accounted for 30% of the total loan portfolio of all lending institutions. This declined to 16.4% \nin 2010 (Figure 4). The reduction in banks\u2019 MSME exposure is common across banking groups. Thrifts \nhave started moving away from the MSME market in 2000. The UKBs followed a similar track in 2002. \nAnd even the rural co-ops began expanding more in non-MSME market in 2006. Between their \nrespective peak years (i.e., years when MSMEs\u2019 share in banks\u2019 lending basket is at its highest) and \n2010, MSMEs\u2019 share of total lending dropped dramatically.28 UKBs reduced MSMEs\u2019 share in their \nportfolio by 14.8 percentage points. Thrifts reduced theirs by 30.6 percentage points. Rural co-ops, \nwhich were focused on the MSME sector, reduced their share the most, decreasing MSME lending by \n23.8 percentage points (from 70.6% of their total loan portfolio down to 46.3%). \n \nIt is important to point out that despite the decline, lending to medium firms in 2010 was \nmore than 300% above the Magna Carta target of 2%, while that for micro and small firms were \ncloser to the targeted 8% of total bank lending. Not so surprisingly, the reduction affected smaller \nfirms more than medium firms (Figure 4). What is intriguing is that in 2010, the bank lending to \nmedium firms, despite declining from a peak of 12.6% of all loans, was still more than threefold of the \nrelevant Magna Carta target. Meanwhile, lending to the micro and small segment was closer to the \nmandatory requirement of 8%. This is mainly driven by the continuous decline of UKB lending to \nmedium-sized enterprises\u2014which in itself is already 1.4 percentage points below the legal requirement \nin 2010. Thrifts and rural co-ops, on the other hand, still keep their ratios above what is mandated by \nthe Magna Carta but the pace at which these ratios are decreasing raises the question of the future \ntrends for loans to micro and small firms.

Direct Compliance versus Alternative Compliance \n \nAs can be gleaned from Figure 5, banks have been favoring direct compliance since 1999 and even \nmore so since 2008. Data provided by the central bank indicate that banks have actually reduced \nexposure to other facilities and instead increased direct lending operations since 2008 to almost 100% \nof their lending to MSMEs. The lack of attractiveness of the yields of alternative notes appears to be \none of the key issues. Lamberte (2002) observes that alternative modes of compliance like SBC notes \n\u201cdo not pay market rates\u201d while deposits with the central bank allotted for SMEs do not bear interest. \nSBC\u2019s wholesale lending also took a hit during the height of the global financial crisis when the central \nbank expanded and reduced the interest rate of its rediscounting facility to keep the banking system \nliquid, \u201cwhich directly competed with SB Corporation's wholesale lending operations,\u201d (ADB 2010). \n ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   21 \nFigure 5: Distribution of Direct and IndirectLending to MSMEs, by Type of Bank \n(% of total compliance) \n \na.

But whether these moves could entice more capital remains to be seen.

This section examines individual bank compliance to the \nMagna Carta for MSMEs, using comprehensive panel data that we have compiled. This is, as far as we \nare  aware,  the  first  panel  data  and  analysis  on  this  question.  Data  on  these  individual  lending \ninstitutions were available quarterly from 2005 to 2011, and did not cover rural and cooperative banks. \n \n1.  General trends of direct compliance by lending institutions \n \nData from individual lending institutions reveals significant heterogeneity in the direct \ncompliance of various lending institutions to the law. In particular, there was a decrease in direct \ncompliance amongst universal and commercial banks beginning in the late 2007. Based on the \npublished statements of conditions disclosed by the BSP, approximately 33% of all the UKBs reporting \ndata to the BSP were lending less than 8% of their total loan to micro and small enterprises by 2011. \nAnother 10% of all UKBs also did not meet the 2% of loan portfolio mandatory lending requirement to \nmedium enterprises (Figure 6). \n \nFigure 6: Share of UKBs Not Directly Complying with the Magna Carta \na.

In 2005, noncompliant UKBs were only about \n5% (small) and 5.3% (medium) of the group. Moreover, about a quarter of the supervised banks has \nnot indicated their MSME lending ratios in their reports. Approximately three quarters of these banks \nwith no data are foreign-owned. Based on the available information on loan portfolios of foreign-\nowned banks, it is possible that the actual noncompliance among UKBs could exceed 60% for micro \nand small, and around 25% for medium enterprises.30 \n \nOne of the reasons the sharp decrease in direct compliance could be the increase in the mandated \nMSME loan share from 6% to 8% following the revision of the law in 2008.  It is possible that many UKBs \nfound it challenging to increase their loans to micro and small enterprises by another 2 percentage points \nwhen the regulation was altered. Even though microenterprises were added into the equation, this proved \n                                                 \n30   In a separate study, SBC also estimated that 60% of UKBs are not complying with the mandated MSE portfolio while 32% \nof UKBs are not complying with the mandated ME portfolio (See Lagua 2011).

Unfortunately the \ndata does not disaggregate loans to small and microenterprises. As for UKBs\u2019 declining share of loans to \nmedium firms, one potential explanation could be the uncertainties of the economic conditions that \naffected the country\u2019s external position following the global financial crisis of 2008. \n \nOn the other hand, direct compliance among thrift banks has increased from 86% in \n2005 to almost 97% as of the first quarter of 2011 (Figure 7). Although it appears that the revision \nin the Magna Carta compounded by the sudden downturn in the general business climate has affected \nthe UKBs lending to MSMEs adversely, these factors seem to have muted effect on thrift banks. \nPerhaps, the policy change may have even benefited them since thrift banks (together with rural and \ncooperative banks) have better access to microenterprises than the universal banks. Hence, the \ninclusion of microenterprises in the mandated lending requirement has most likely allowed some of \nthese thrift banks that are formerly below the benchmark to meet the legal requirement in spite of the \n2 percentage point increase in the legal threshold. \n \nFigure 7: Share of THBsNot Directly Complying with the Magna Carta \n \na.

Robustness of direct compliance from 2005 to 2010  \n \nIn order to better compare compliance to the Magna Carta for MSMEs across individual banks from \n2005 to 2010, we conduct robustness checks and truncate the sample size in order to address \nreporting errors. We identified 136 banks for which quarterly balance sheet information are provided \nover the period of study, 130 of which reported their lending ratios. We correct for outliers by removing \nbank-quarter observations where the compliance ratios are below the 1st percentile and above the \n99th percentile values. Next, we exclude banks with less than 8 quarters of time series observations. \nThese restrictions enable us to focus on banks with sufficient data on compliance ratios while dropping \nbanks that were previously merged, acquired and bankrupt. Our final sample consists of 109 banks, \nwhich altogether represent over 90% of the assets of all universal, commercial, and thrift banks over \nthe period.  \n \n ", "24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \nWe also define four indicators to measure the degree of banks\u2019 compliance to the Magna Carta \nLaw. UNDERCOMPLY is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the bank\u2019s lending to the MSME \nsegment for each quarter is less than the mandatory bank lending requirement. This legal mandate is \n6% for small firms until Q2 2008, and 8%, thereafter; and 2% for medium-sized firms. JUSTCOMPLY is \na dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the bank\u2019s lending ratio falls within 100 to 110% of the target. \nOVERCOMPLY takes the value of 1 if the lending share ranges from 110% to 200% of the target. \nSUPERCOMPLY is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the loan share for the segment exceeds \nthe respective target by 200%.  \n \nJust as the aggregated data has highlighted, the average loan shares of both micro and \nsmall enterprises and medium enterprises were far higher than the legal targets of 6% and 2% \nrespectively (Table 10). On average, the banks in this truncated sample increased the share of micro \nand small enterprises loans within their portfolio from an average of 15.8% in 2005 to 17.5% in 2010. \nThus the average lending institution (out of 130) was lending 3 times the targeted share for small and \nmedium enterprises. However, loans to medium firms were only slightly higher than targeted: in 2010, \nthe average bank lent 10% of their portfolio to medium firms. \n \nNonetheless, there is considerable dispersion in banks\u2019 decisions to lend to MSMEs. \nAlthough universal and commercial banks supplied the biggest amount of loans to MSMEs, their own \nloan portfolio reflected that lending to MSMEs were not their priorities. For these banks, the share of \nmicro and small firms in their loan portfolios ranged from 1.7% to 25.4% in 2010, while the share of \nmedium firms ranged from 0.1% to 24.9%. It is noteworthy that the average UKB reported only 7.7% of \nloans to micro and small enterprises, which is below the Magna Carta target. \n \nMeanwhile, there is even greater dispersion in the portfolio decisions of the smaller thrift \nbanks although on average they greatly exceeded the Magna Carta targets. The average thrift \nbank allotted 21.8% of its loans to micro and small firms (almost 3 times the target), and another 11% to \nmedium firms (over 5 times the target). This suggests that on average, the focus of thrift banks was \nindeed the smaller firms.31 Nevertheless, the share of loans to micro and small firms ranged from 1.1% to \n88.2%, while that of medium firms ranged from 0.2% to 62.4%. Clearly, some thrift banks were \nfocusing on micro and small firms, while some focused on larger firms. \n \nThe trends from individual banks reporting data can be summarized in the following three \npoints. First, universal and commercial banks tend to not focus on MSMEs though they supplied the \nbulk of credits to MSMEs. Second, loans to medium firms were much higher than legally mandated \nacross all banks. Third, there was a huge dispersion across banks in their optimal loan portfolio choices.  \n \nHow many banks were directly complying with the Magna Carta Law? Our panel dataset on \ncompliances included 24 quarters of data that can shed some light on the dispersion in portfolio \nchoices (Table 11). We find that only 65.4% of all banks were complying directly on the target for micro \nand small enterprises at least one quarter. In other words, 36.4% of banks reported at least one \nincident of undercompliance. Only 2.1% of all banks reported undercomplying with the target of direct \nlending to the micro and small enterprises for 13 to 16 quarters (more than half of all the periods \nobserved).  Another  5.5%  of  banks  reported  undercomplying  between  9  and  12  quarters.  More \nimportantly, the majority of banks reported overcomplying (and even supercomplying) with the micro \n                                                 \n31   Interestingly, the share of medium firms in the average thrift bank loan portfolio has decreased from 14% in 2005 to 11% in \n2010.

", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   27 \nthe thrifts have a long-term strategy of supercompliance by allocating at least 16% of their loan \nportfolio to micro and small enterprises for at least 4 years (>16 quarters). This is double the legal \ntarget. On the other hand, less than 25% of all UKBs reported any instance of supercompliance, and \nnone consistently supercomplied for 4 years or more. \n \nRevealed portfolio allocation of loans to medium-sized enterprises was more similar across \nbanks.  Approximately  13.3%  of  UKBs  and  16.1%  of  thrifts  reported  at  least  one  quarter  of \nundercompliance. More interestingly, the supercompliance rate was higher for UKBs than thrifts. \nApproximately 40% of the UKBs supercomplied for at least 4 years compared with only 31% of the \nthrifts. This suggests that compared to the smaller thrift banks, some of the larger commercial banks \nmight have a comparative advantage in lending to medium firms. \n \nKernel densities of distribution of banks\u2019 direct lending to MSMEs from 2005 to 2010 show \nclustering around the Magna Carta targets (Figure 8). The kernel density estimates, which are skewed to \nthe right, suggest that bank financing to micro and small enterprises (for most banks) comprise only \nabout 10% of the banks\u2019 loan portfolios. Compliance to the medium enterprise provision has higher \ndensity  at  a  slightly  lower  ratio  of  compliance,  reflecting  the  lower  required  lending  to  medium \nenterprises as a ratio of the banks\u2019 loan portfolio.

Moreover, \nthe kernel density estimates for the thrifts and domestic-owned banks revealed their bigger exposures \nto micro and small enterprises compared with UKBs and foreign banks.

For the UKBs, we observe a modest shift to the right, suggesting that more banks \ncomply within the 8%\u201315% range from 2009 compared with the earlier periods. Interestingly, it is \naround this period that the proposed amendment to the Magna Carta (i.e., increasing the legal target \nfrom 6% to 8%) was fully implemented.  Similar shifts are observed in the case of foreign bank MSE \nlending after 2008 with the tail extending further to the right, which may suggest increased lending to \nMSEs by foreign banks. The data also reveals a modest increase in the density estimate around \ncompliance rates between 8% and 20% from 2008 along with a slight decrease between the 30%\u201360% \nrange in the case of thrifts.  \n \nFigure 10, which shows banks\u2019 lending to medium enterprises, suggest a slightly different story \nparticularly in the case of UKBs.

This is in \ncontrast with UKBs\u2019 MSE lending, where most banks\u2019 lending clustered near 10%, close to the imposed \nminimum mandatory credit allocation of 6% (from 2005\u20132007) and 8% (from 2008\u20132010).

Domestic and foreign banks within and outside of NCR \n \nPerhaps not surprisingly, banks headquartered in the Manila metropolitan area lent less to MSMEs \nrelative to their counterparts headquartered elsewhere (Figure 11). The median MSME loan share by \nbank type, ownership, and location indicate that median portfolio share of micro and small firms for non-\nManila banks were consistently more than double that of lending institutions headquartered in the NCR. \nFurthermore, the median values of MSE financing are concentrated somewhere around the legal targets \nparticularly for UKBs and foreign banks, and that the shift may just be an indication of the increase in the \nrequired lending from 6% to 8% in 2008. We also observe an interesting development in loan to medium \nenterprises. In the earlier years, thrifts, domestic banks and banks headquartered outside the National \nCapital Region reported higher median share of medium enterprise loans. Nonetheless, this median \nshare  has  been  generally  decreasing.  By  2009,  the  median  share  of  Manila-based  banks  actually \nsurpassed that of non-Manila based banks. Further, by 2010, the median share of medium enterprises in \nthe loan portfolio of UKBs was larger than that for thrifts. This suggests that new technology and the \ninclusion of microenterprises under the Magna Carta have changed the equilibrium and comparative \nadvantages of various lending institutions and their target markets. \n \nThe six parts of Figure 12 further illustrate the range of distribution of the loan share of small \nfirms across banks of different types, ownership, and geographic region over the period of study. From \n2005 to 2007, at least 75% of the UKBs directly complying with the Magna Carta lending targets for \nmicro and small enterprises, when the legal target was set at 6% (Figure 12 a.1). However, the percentage \nof UKBs that complied diminished from 2008. By 2010, we see though that the 25th percentile value of \nmicro and small enterprise loans returned to the same level  as in 2005. Nevertheless, this is around 6% \nor 2 percentage points shy from the required small firm financing after the Magna Carta was revised in \n2008. Only around 50% of the UKBs in the sample are able to comply by 2010. \n \nOn the other hand, at least 75% of thrifts in 2008 (and beyond) complied with the mandated \ncredit allocation of 8% to small enterprises. In fact, 50% of thrifts allotted almost 15% of their loans to \nmicro and small firms, despite the very slight downward trend in the median share after 2008. \nFurthermore, a quarter of the thrifts allotted at least 30% of their loans to micro and small firms \n(despite the dip in 2009). Most importantly, the 25th percentile loan share steadily increased from \n2005 to 2010 for thrifts \n \nFor domestic banks as a whole (including UKBs and thrifts), we see modest increases in the \n25th and 50th percentile values of loans to micro and small enterprises. We, however, observe that \nafter 2007, the 75th percentile value declined. This suggests a decrease in the dispersion of optimal \nstrategies and allocation of loans to micro and small enterprises. \n \nInterestingly, the scenario observed in domestic banks is opposite to what is implied by the \ndata of foreign banks, which saw a huge increase in dispersion in their optimal allocation of loans to \nsmaller firms (Figure 12 b.2). Beginning in 2007, we observe a decrease in the 25th percentile lending \nshare to smaller firms below the Magna Carta targets, accompanied by an increasing trend of foreign \nbanks\u2019 median and 75th percentile loan shares. As a result, the dispersion of optimal strategies for \nforeign banks increased considerably, and the 75th/25th percentile ratio increased significantly from \n2005 to 2010.  \n \n \n ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   31 \nFigure 11: Median Values of Bank MSE and ME Firm Financing, 2005\u20132010 \na.1.

In the beginning of our study period, 2005, at least 75% \nof the foreign banks complied with the Magna Carta target of 6% for smaller firms. By the end of the \nstudy period, a smaller proportion of the foreign banks complied directly with the legal target at 8% \nmandated in 2008. In a way, this suggests that the increase in the mandatory allocation to small firms \nmay be less binding for foreign banks.  As substantiated by empirical literature, foreign banks have \nnumerous  disadvantages  relative  to  domestic  banks  when  it  comes  to  lending  to  small  firms ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   33 \n(e.g., personal ties, organizational structure, understanding of social dynamics, etc). In the case of the \nPhilippines, these disadvantage could have been further limited branches and affiliates of foreign \nbanks. Nevertheless, the data also indicated an increasingly divergent set of optimal strategies and a \nsorting of foreign banks into those that figured out how to lend to smaller firms profitably, against \nthose that could not. \n \nOn the other hand, although non-Manila based banks tend to lend more to smaller firms, \nthe location of banks headquarters did not matter as much in terms of general compliance for \nthose at the 25th percentile.  For both groups the 25th percentile value increased in 2009. However, \nfor Manila-based banks the increase was just about enough to meet the new Magna Carta target, while \nfor non-Manila based banks, the increase was significantly above the target. This is perhaps not \nsurprising,  given  that  the  median  non-Manila  bank  allocate  over  20%  of  their  loans  to  smaller \nenterprises,  well  above  250%  of  the  legal  threshold.  However,  what  is  more  interesting  is  the \ndifferences in the 75th/25th percentile ratio: for Manila banks, the 2008 amendment resulted in a \nnarrowed dispersion of loan shares, while for non-Manila-based banks, the 75th percentile value \nincreased sharply to above 35%, thereby widening the dispersion of the loan allocation to smaller firms. \nThus, it could be that the inclusion of microenterprises in the coverage of the Law has increased the \ndirect compliance rates for non-Manila banks. By 2010, at least, 75% of these banks allot at least \napproximately 13% of their portfolio to micro and small enterprises.  \n \nAs we repeatedly saw, banks found it easier to comply with the Magna Carta targets for loans to \nmedium enterprises. Across the six groupings we examined, all had 25th percentile lending rate that was \nabove the legal target (Figure 13). We highlight two trends. First, the median lending of UKBs and foreign \nbanks increased over time in contrast to thrifts and non-Manila-based banks where median lending \ndecreased. By the end of 2010, at least 75% of the UKBs allot at least 4% of their total loan portfolio to \nmedium firms\u2014more than double the Magna Carta minimum allocation of 2%. In addition, about 50% of \nforeign banks allotted two times the required 2% mandatory credit allocation. Banks headquartered in \nthe NCR, on the other hand, have more or less stable credit allocation to medium firms throughout the \nstudy period. The second point is that increasingly, there was a widening dispersion of optimal allocation \nof loans to medium firms by UKBs, while the dispersion decreased for every other group. \n \nTo further analyze the path dependence of optimal portfolio allocation for bank financing in \nthe Philippines, we group the banks according to their financing behavior from 2005\u20132007. We define \nthe following variables: StartLow, StartModerate, StartHigh, and StartVeryHigh. StartLow are the banks \nwhose average compliance to the Magna Carta from 2005\u20132007, separately, are below the 25th \npercentile. StartModerate and StartHigh comprise the banks whose average lending from 2005\u20132007 \nare higher than the 25th percentile, but less than the median value and above the median but less than \nthe  75th  percentile,  respectively.  Finally,  StartVeryHigh  consists  of  banks  whose  average  lending \nbehavior of these banks through time. We highlight two significant changes after 2007 that may \npotentially affect small businesses financing: (i) the increased mandatory lending allocation to micro \nand small enterprises in 2008 and (ii) the global financial crisis from 2008\u20132009. \n \nWe note three important observations from Figure 14 depicting the median values of bank \nsmall firm financing through time according to bank type, ownership, and geographic region. First, for \nbanks that started low and moderate (StartLow and StartModerate), their median values are stable \n(slight increases, but not notable) from 2005\u20132010, with the exception of foreign banks and banks \nheadquartered outside the NCR. Second, for banks that allotted a significant proportion of their loan \nportfolio to smaller firms from 2005\u20132007, we see a significant decrease in the median lending share \nafter 2007 for these group of banks regardless of the bank type, ownership, and geographic region. \n ", "34   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \nThird, we observe an increasing small firm financing trend for the foreign banks and Outside NCR for \nboth StartLow and StartModerate.  \n \nFigure 13: Percentile Values of Loans to Medium Enterprises, 2005\u20132010 \na.1.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n \nTo summarize, our results highlighted three trends. First, although the total lending levels to MSMEs \nremained fairly stable, the percentage shares of loans allocated to MSMEs declined drastically from \nabout 30% of total loans in 2002 to 16% of total loans in 2010. Second, banks are finding it harder to \nmeet the target for loans to smaller firms, especially after the target was revised upwards in 2008. The \nnew mandates resulted in a sharp increase in noncompliance in direct lending to micro and small firms, \nespecially amongst universal and commercial banks. Kernel density estimates suggest that the revision \nof the Magna Carta in 2008 was binding for small firm lending particularly for the universal and \ncommercial banks. Third, there is an increased dispersion in optimal loan portfolio across banks. Most \nsurprisingly, the absolute level of MSME lending by rural co-ops declined since 2008. \n \nLooking ahead, we see various developments recently could potentially further reduce banks\u2019 \nlending to MSMEs. For one, the implementation of the new Basel 3 framework, which raises banks\u2019 \nminimum financial ratios (e.g., Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio and capital adequacy ratio), \nintroduces new parameters such as liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio, and at the \nsame time increases the risk weights of several asset items, could potentially siphon credit away from \nthe MSME sector. These include the implementation of the Basel 3 parameters, the relaxation of \nforeign investor participation in rural co-ops, the establishment of the long-awaited credit information \nbureau,  and  the  expansion  of  the  Credit  Surety  Fund  program  of  the  BSP.  There  appears  to  a \nconsensus that the new set of Basel 3 bank soundness criteria will have a dampening effect on MSME \nlending, not to mention that the BSP just announced a much higher set of ratios than what were \nprescribed by Basel 3. On the positive side, the latter three developments will most likely boost \nMSMEs\u2019 bankability.   \n \nNonetheless, the BSP shows not only its willingness to adhere to the new set of standards but \ndirected Philippine banks to maintain financial ratios that are 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher than the \ninternational benchmarks (BSP Circular No. 781 of 2013). It stipulated that inclusive of conservation \nbuffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, banks should maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 8.5% \n(versus 7% in the B3F), a Tier 1 ratio of 10% (versus 8.5% in the B3F) and a capital adequacy ratio of \n12% (versus 10% in the B3F).  In the same circular it was noted that the new set of guidelines will be \neffective beginning 1 January 2014.33  \n \nAnother potential drag on MSME financing is the continued decline in the number of rural co-\nops (See box). A spate of bank closures has reduced the number of rural co-ops from 617 by end 2011 \nto 577 by the end of June 2013. This trend may not have a severe impact on the total value of loans by \nvirtue of the small size of rural co-ops relative to the entire banking sector. But, adverse effect could be \nfelt in terms of the number of MSME clients in the countryside that could lose access to formal credit \nand better served by rural co-ops prioritizing micro and small clients. \n \nOn the upside, recognizing the challenges faced by rural banks, the government passed RA \n10574 on 24 May 2013 that effectively increased the allowable equity share of foreigners in rural banks \nfrom 40% to 60%. The new law, which amended Sections 4 to 8 of the Rural Bank Act of 1992 \n                                                 \n33   OECD (2012) argued that \u201cthe retail risk rating (75%) can be used to weight SME loans, provided the bank\u2019s portfolio is \ndiverse and the bank\u2019s loan to an SME borrower is less than EUR1 million.\u201d Nevertheless, it also noted that \u201cthe weighting \nsystem also favors many large enterprises over small ones: large companies with good external credit ratings (AAA) are \nassigned a 20% risk weight, whereas SMEs that are unrated have risk weightings of 100% or 75%. Under Basel III, the \ndifference in core Tier 1 capital the bank needs to hold against their loans is remarkable: 7% of the loan for SMEs with \n100% risk weighting, as opposed to 1.4% (7% \u00d7 20%) for a large company with an AAA rating.\u201d \n ", "38   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 463 \n(RA 7353), sought to assist rural banks in meeting the capital requirements and put them \u201con a level \nplaying field with its thrift and commercial banking counterparts that are able to take in foreign \npartners\u201d according to one of the bill\u2019s authors in the Senate (Macrohon 2013). \n \nThe prospect of having a fully functional credit information bureau by end of 2014 could also \nhelp a lot in improving the transparency of MSMEs\u2019 financial standing. Named Credit Information \nCorporation (CiC), the government-owned and controlled credit bureau was established courtesy of \nthe passage of the Credit Information System Act (RA 9510) on 31 October 2008. The implementing \nrules and regulations of RA 9510 were ironed out on 27 May 2009. However, it took more than 2 years \nbefore CiC started operating on 16 December 2011 and another 5 months before its board members \nwere appointed by the President.34 Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the \ngovernment agency taking charge in setting up CiC, announced that it is expecting the new credit \nbureau to function fully in December 2014 (Dumlao 2013).  \n \nThe CiC, which will mainly target small businesses, is a public\u2013private partnership co-owned by \nthe government (60%) and the private sector (40%). As of November 2012, the private sector parties \nwith stakes in the corporation include the Philippine Cooperatives Center, Bankers Association of the \nPhilippines (BAP), Credit Card Association of the Philippines, Chamber of Thrift Banks, Rural Bankers \nAssociation of the Philippines, and the Philippine Credit Reporting Alliance (CiC 2012). Note that, \nprior to the establishment of CiC, two credit bureaus have been created. These are the Credit \nInformation Bureau Inc., which was an initiative of the Central Bank of the Philippines and the \nFinancial Executives Institute of the Philippines, and the BAP Credit Bureau set up by the BAP in \n1991.35  However, the aforementioned two credit bureaus have largely confined their operations within \nlarge companies. \n \nThe expansion of the BSP\u2019s Credit Surety Fund program is an additional booster to MSME \nlending. From just one fund, the number of pooled resource financing vehicle rose to 27 by the end of \nMarch 2013. Since 2010, the approved loans increased fivefold from P134 million to P679.2 million by \nthe end of the first quarter of 2013. In the same period, released loans increased over sixfold from a \nlittle less than P82.2 million to P501.6 million.36 \n \n \nVI.  CONCLUSION \n \nDespite the Magna Carta and its subsequent revisions along with the accompanying support measures, \nbank lending to MSMEs has not increased much. More disconcertingly, MSME lending is generally on a \ndecline as a ratio of banks\u2019 total loan portfolio. A substantial drop in MSMEs\u2019 share in bank loans is \nparticularly evident among UKBs. Even thrifts and rural co-ops, which are supposed to be the ones \nabsorbing the MSME credit demand, have likewise reduced their lending ratios to the MSMEs quite \nsignificantly from 2004 to 2010. Although nominal values show that lending by thrifts and rural co-ops \nto MSMEs are growing at a decent pace, it appears that their lending to other sectors are expanding \neven more briskly.  \n \nSmaller firms are impacted more than medium-sized firms with the ongoing migration of bank \nlending portfolio to non-MSME clients. UKBs as a group have already decreased their MSME lending \n                                                 \n34   See CiC Milestones: Historical Background and Timeline. \n35   The Central Bank of the Philippines was renamed Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in 1993 (See box). \n36   See BSP (2013b). ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines   |   39 \nbelow the mandated 8% ratio. At the level of individual institutions, there is also a notable increase in \nthe number of UKBs not complying with the MSE lending provision of the Magna Carta. In other \nwords, it is more profitable for UKBs to pay the penalties rather than lend to MSEs.  \n \nOn the other hand, MSE lending of thrifts and RCBs continues to expand. But, lending data \nillustrate that the share of MSEs in their credit disbursements has declined significantly although still \nwell above the Magna Carta\u2019s required ratio. Further research would be required to understand the \ndeterminants of this pattern. Nonetheless, understanding these recent changes in MSME lending \npreferences would be essential in crafting future financial inclusion programs. On a positive note, \nbank-level data suggest that more thrifts have recently become more compliant to MSE lending \nrequirement.  \n \nWe conjecture that perhaps abolishing the Magna Carta targets for loans to medium-sized \nenterprises might not have much adverse effects. It is also notable that consistently, banks do not have \ntrouble complying with the mandated lending ratio for middle-sized firms. As of 2010, UKBs, thrifts and \nrural  co-ops  maintained  a  good  positive  margin  with  respect  to  the  legal  requirement  and \nnoncompliance was limited. However, the steady downward trend in MSME loan allocation across \nbank groups in recent years cannot be overlooked. This trend parallels the downward drift of banks\u2019 \nlending ratio to micro and small firms explained above. The differences lie in the degree of the decline \n\u2014which is more muted in the case of lending to medium firms whereby the banks\u2019 allocation was still \nmuch higher than mandated by law. \n \nThe overall pattern of decreasing share of bank lending to MSMEs thus suggests a need to \nrevisit, if not redesign, the current MSME lending policy framework. While the dynamism of the MSME \nsector hinges upon having reliable access to financing, banks in return should be given reasonable \nincentives to align their business models with the government\u2019s social agenda. In addition, there are \nways to increase alternative sources of credit for MSMEs, such as developing equities and bonds \nmarket  suitable  for  MSMEs.  The  government  could  also  further  improve  measures  to  increase \nfinancing supply by harnessing untapped domestic savings and foreign exchange reserves rather than \nrelying on a strict mandate on banks\u2019 portfolio allocation. Banks were finding it increasingly onerous to \ncomply with the law and more than a half of commercial and universal banks undercomplied for at \nleast a quarter during the period we observed. Expanding alternative means of financial access for \nMSMEs would be even more important given looming policy and institutional changes. \n \n \n ", " \nAPPENDIX \n \nTable A.1: Bank-Level Data for Universal and Commercial Banks \n \n  Data on Loans to Micro and Small Enterprises  Data on Loans to Medium Enterprises \nTotal  Total \nTotal  Number  Number of  Number of  Total  Number  Number of  Number of \nNumber  of Banks  Compliant  Noncompliant  Number  of Banks  Compliant  Noncompliant \nQuarter  of Banks  with Data  Banks  Banks  of Banks  with Data  Banks  Banks \nQ1 2005  42  40  40  0  42  40  40  0 \nQ2 2005  42  40  38  2  42  39  39  0 \nQ3 2005  41  39  39  0  41  39  39  0 \nQ4 2005  41  39  38  1  41  39  38  1 \nQ1 2006  41  40  39  1  41  40  40  0 \nQ2 2006  40  39  39  0  40  39  39  0 \nQ3 2006  40  38  36  2  40  38  38  0 \nQ4 2006  40  38  36  2  40  38  38  0 \nQ1 2007  40  38  36  2  40  38  36  2 \nQ2 2007  39  37  37  0  39  37  37  0 \nQ3 2007  39  32  31  1  39  32  31  1 \nQ4 2007  39  31  28  3  39  30  30  0 \nQ1 2008  39  30  26  4  39  30  30  0 \nQ2 2008  39  30  27  3  39  30  29  1 \nQ3 2008  39  29  23  6  39  28  27  1 \nQ4 2008  39  29  17  12  39  27  24  3 \nQ1 2009  39  30  16  14  39  28  25  3 \nQ2 2009  39  27  16  11  39  27  25  2 \nQ3 2009  39  27  16  11  39  28  26  2 \nQ4 2009  39  26  16  10  39  28  25  3 \nQ1 2010  39  26  16  10  39  28  26  2 \nQ2 2010  39  27  17  10  39  28  26  2 \nQ3 2010  40  28  15  13  40  29  27  2 \nQ4 2010  39  27  18  9  39  30  27  3 \nQ1 2011  39  27  15  12  39  30  26  4 \nQ2 2011  39  29  16  13  39  31  27  4 \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using the data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. \n   ", "42   |   Appendix  \nTable A.2: Bank-Level Data for Thrifts\n \n   Data on Loans to Micro and Small Enterprises  Data on Loans to Medium Enterprises \nTotal  Total \nNumber  Total  Number  Total \nTotal  of Banks  Total  Number  Total  of Banks  Total  Number \nNumber  with  Number of  of Banks  Number  with  Number of  of Banks \nQuarter  of Banks  Data  Banks  with Data  of Banks  Data  Banks  with Data \nQ1 2005  85  64  55  9  85  60  55  5 \nQ2 2005  85  63  58  5  85  59  53  6 \nQ3 2005  84  63  58  5  84  60  55  5 \nQ4 2005  84  63  54  9  84  59  53  6 \nQ1 2006  86  63  57  6  86  59  56  3 \nQ2 2006  84  62  57  5  84  59  54  5 \nQ3 2006  84  62  56  6  84  61  56  5 \nQ4 2006  84  67  62  5  84  66  63  3 \nQ1 2007  85  66  63  3  85  66  64  2 \nQ2 2007  83  65  62  3  83  65  63  2 \nQ3 2007  83  65  59  6  83  64  62  2 \nQ4 2007  83  63  58  5  83  62  59  3 \nQ1 2008  82  65  58  7  82  64  61  3 \nQ2 2008  81  64  58  6  81  62  59  3 \nQ3 2008  81  62  57  5  81  60  58  2 \nQ4 2008  81  62  56  6  81  59  56  3 \nQ1 2009  76  65  60  5  76  63  60  3 \nQ2 2009  76  64  61  3  76  60  58  2 \nQ3 2009  75  64  60  4  75  62  61  1 \nQ4 2009  75  64  62  2  75  63  61  2 \nQ1 2010  75  63  61  2  75  62  60  2 \nQ2 2010  75  63  61  2  75  63  59  4 \nQ3 2010  74  64  63  1  74  62  59  3 \nQ4 2010  74  64  62  2  74  62  59  3 \nQ1 2011  74  63  61  2  74  62  59  3 \nQ2 2011                 \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using the data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. \n ", " \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). 2004.

Washington, DC. \n \n ", "Assessing Mandated Credit Programs: Case Study of the Magna Carta in the Philippines\nThis paper examines the Magna Carta Law in the Philippines, which mandates banks to allocate 2% of \ntheir total loan portfolios to medium-sized firms and 8% to micro and small firms. The paper highlights \nthree findings. First, although total lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) grew slightly, \nMSME loan shares declined drastically from 30% in 2002 to 16.4% in 2010. Second, there was a sharp rise \nin noncompliance after loan targets increased in 2008. Third, there is increased heterogeneity in optimal \nloan portfolio across banks. Most surprisingly, total MSME lending by rural and cooperative banks declined \nsince 2008. Abolishing Magna Carta target for medium-sized enterprise loans would most likely yield little \nadverse\u00a0effects.\nASSeSSing MAnDAteD \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nCreDit ProgrAMS: CASe \nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty.
