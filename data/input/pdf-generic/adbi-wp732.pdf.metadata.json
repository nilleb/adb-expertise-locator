INTRODUCTION \n\nK. H. Park \n\nMany scholars have focused on the economic  and social effects of income distribution \nas  an  enduring  topic  of  consequence.  Many  studies  have  analyzed  the  relationship \nbetween  income  distribution  and  economic  progress  (e.g.  Park  1996b,  1998).  Some \nhave  further  extended  their  analysis  to  the  linkage  of  income  inequality  and  political \nviolence (see Park, 1986). A pioneering study by Kuznets (1955) proposed that income \ninequality  tends  to  initially  increase,  peak,  and  then  fall  as  economies  develop.  The \neconomic  development  process  involves  structural  changes  that,  along  with  dualism, \ncause  this  progression.  Urbanization  and  population  growth  associated  with  the  early \nstages of economic development initially exacerbate income inequality, but subsequent \npolitical  factors  and  economic  policies  decelerate  income  growth  in the  upper  income \ngroup  while  simultaneously  improving  the  situation  of  the  lower  income  group.  The \nrecent  rise  of  national  income  inequality  has  prompted  inquiry  into  the  causes  of  the \nresurgence  of  income  inequality.  Recent  globalization  and  co-occurring  outsourcing \nand  wage  compression  may  have  fostered  a  reversal  of  the  increasing  trend  of \nbalanced income distribution.  \n\nThis  widely  recognized  inverted-U  hypothesis  of  Kuznets  has  a  long  history  as  a \ncontentious subject in economics. The academic world witnessed  a surge of research \non  the  Kuznets  hypothesis  in  the  1970s,  principally  comparative  empirical  studies  \nwith cross-country  data  (Kravis  1960;  Kuznets  1963; Ahluwalia  1974;  Robinson  1976; \nStewart  1978; Winegarden  1979,  to  name  a  few). When  updated  data  on  distribution  \nof  income  became  available  later  in  the  1990s  and  2000s,  there  was  a  revival  of  \ncross-country empirical studies on the Kuznets hypothesis (Nielson and Alderson 1995; \nChecchi 2000; Wells 2006).  \n\nThe  majority  of  the  cross-country  empirical  research  (Kuznets  1963;  Ahluwalia  1974; \nPapanek and Kyn 1986; De Gregorio and Lee 2002) found  evidence that supports the \nKuznets hypothesis while a few studies disputed this hypothesis (Saith 1983; Ravallion \n2004). More recent studies have proposed the  \u201cgreat U-turn\u201d hypothesis, implying that \nthe  trend  again  reverses  further  down  the  timeline  of  development  for  countries  with \nvery high income (Alderson and Nielsen, 2002).  \n\nDue  to  the  variety  of  classifications  and  types  of  income  inequality,  the  concepts  of \nincome inequality that are used in the literature are clarified as follows. The concept of \n\u201cworld  income  inequality  (or  global  income  inequality)\u201d  ranks  all  individuals  in  all \ncountries  and  territories  from  the  richest  to  the  poorest,  not  taking  into  account  their \ncountry  of  origin.  The  citizen  of  the  world  is  the  unit  of  analysis  instead  of  countries. \nThe  next  concept  is  \u201cinternational  income  inequality  (or  between-countries  income \ninequality),\u201d  which  measures  income  inequality  existing  between  countries  resulting \nfrom  contradistinction  of  their  per  capita  GDP  or  per  capita  income.  In  this  second \nconcept,  countries  are  the  units  of  analysis  rather  than  individuals.  The  final,  most \ncommonly  studied  inequality  is  \u201cnational  income  inequality  (or  within-countries  income \ninequality),\u201d  which  measures  the  variance  of  income  distribution  within  a  country. \nYitzhaki (1994) indicated that \u201cglobal income inequality\u201d can be formulated as the sum \nof  international  income  inequality,  national  income  inequality,  and  the  residual.  The \ntrends  of  these  income  inequalities  for  the  period  1820  to  1992  are  analyzed  by \nBourguignon  and  Morrisson  (2002),  relying  on  the  data  from  15  individual  countries \nwith copious data  and 18 other regions composed of country clusters. Figure 1 shows \nthe  trends  of  the  three  different  income  inequalities.  In  our  research,  the  focus  is  on \nnational income inequality, also known as \u201cwithin-countries income inequality.\u201d  \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK. H. Park \n\nFigure 1: Three Income Inequalities \n\nSource: Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002). \n\n \n\nAlthough  this  study  is  an  extension  of  abundant  cross-country  analyses  previously \nperformed  on  the  Kuznets  hypothesis,  some  particulars  distinguish  our  research  from \npast  research.  First,  instead  of  focusing  on  the  inverted-U  hypothesis  itself,  the \nimportance  of  education  variables  as  significant  explanatory  variables  for  income \ninequality  is  emphasized.  Second,  the  effect  of  globalization  on  income  inequality  is \nconsidered.  Since  the  1980s,  many  countries  have  executed  financial  and  trade \nliberalization policies and the level of globalization has generally been increasing with a \nfew  exceptions.  Globalization  affects  income  inequality  both  directly  and  indirectly  by \nimpacting  education  levels.  Finally,  the  present  study  analyzes  how  globalization  and \neducation affect income inequality with a focus on the Asian and Pacific regions. \n\nOur  research  tries  to  define  more  accurately  the  connection  between  education  and \nincome  inequality  in  the  framework  of  an  ever  more  globalized  and  integrated  world \neconomy,  using  expanded  and  recently  updated  data.  The  rest  of  the  paper  is \norganized  as  follows.  Section  2  concisely  reviews  the  relevant  literature  on  the \nvariables affecting income inequality, particularly on the connection between education \nand  income  inequality.  The  third  section  discusses  educational  attainment  and \neducational inequality in the Asian and Pacific areas while Section 4 discusses income \ninequality  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  Section  5  presents  models  for  estimating  the \ninfluences of education and globalization on income inequality along with a description \nof the data  and variables  applied in  the analysis. The regression results of the models \nare  interpreted  in  Section  6.  Conclusions  and  policy  considerations  are  presented  in \nthe final section.  \n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK. H. Park \n\n2.  REVIEW OF LITERATURE \n\nSubsequent  to  the  publication  of  \u201chuman  capital  theory\u201d  by  Becker  (1964),  several \nstudies  have  considered  the  influence  of  education  variables  on  the  distribution  of \nincome.  As  reported  by  Park  (1996a),  four  different  categories  of  education  variables \nare  commonly  presented  in  literature  to  explain  their  influence  on  income  distribution. \nFirst, a flow variable of schooling signified by institute enrollments at different levels of \neducation  is  usually  utilized  (e.g.,  primary  and  secondary  education  in  Ahluwalia \n(1976);  secondary  and  tertiary  education  in  Barro  (2000),  and  Alderson  and  Nielsen \n(2002)). Second, a stock variable of schooling characterized by the average or median \nyears  of  schooling  of  the  labor  force  or  general  population  is  utilized  (Winegarden \n1979; Ram 1984; De Gregorio and Lee 2002).  \n\nA  number  of  studies  applied  both  the  flow  and  stock  variables,  that  is,  enrollments  at \neach  level  of  schooling  and  the  average  years  of  education  as  the  independent \nvariables  (e.g.,  Psacharopoulos  and  Tilak,  1991).  The  third  and  fourth  types  of \neducation  variables  applied  in  regard  to  income  inequality  are  education  inequality \nderived  from the  distribution  of  educational  attainment  (Checchi  2000)  and  the  rate  of \nreturn to education (Tilak 1989). There has been a substantial amount of research that \nconsiders  both  the  average  years  of  schooling  and  education  inequality  as  main \nexplanatory variables (Ram 1984; Park 1996a; De Gregorio and Lee 2002). \n\nWe  limited  our  literature  review  to  empirical  research  that  analyzes  the  influence  of \nboth  education  level  and  education  inequality  upon  income  inequality.  Numerous \nfindings  (Tinbergen  1972; Winegarden  1979;  Park  1996a)  indicate  that more  years  of \nschooling and a more balanced dispersion of schooling among the population promote \nimprovement in income distribution. However, Ram (1984) reported contrary empirical \nresults.  Ram  found  that  more  advanced  education  exerts  a  mild  balancing  influence  \non  income  distribution,  which  corresponds  with  most  findings.  Yet,  his  inference  that  \na  larger  dispersion  of  schooling  improves  income  distribution  conflicts  with  many \nprevious  studies.  Furthermore,  the  coefficients  of  the  education  inequality  variable  in \nhis findings are not statistically significant.  \n\nBarro  (2000)  found  different  consequences  of  schooling  on  income  inequality,  based \non  the  different  levels  of  education  applied  in  his  models:  an  inverse  relationship \nbetween  primary  education  enrollment  and  income  inequality, but  a  direct  relationship \nbetween  tertiary  education  enrollment  and  income  inequality.  Alderson  and  Nielsen\u2019s \n(2002)  findings  indicate  that  income  inequality  has  an  inverse  relationship  with  the \naverage years of schooling in developed countries. \n\nOther  likely  factors  that  influence  income  inequality  have  been  studied  by  others.  Li, \nSquire  and  Zou  (1998)  concluded that  no connection  exists  between  political  freedom \nand  income  inequality  while  Li  and  Zou  (2002)  examined  the  effect  of  economic \nfreedom  on  income  inequality.  Barro  (2000)  saw  no  evidence  relating  democracy  to \nincome inequality. Milanovic and Squire (2005)  found the magnitude  of liberal policies \nwas  inversely  related  to  greater  income  equality  in  more  impoverished  countries  and \nwith less income equality in more affluent countries.  \n\nSome  research concentrated  on  the  link  between  globalization  and  income  inequality. \nAlderson and Nielsen (2002) focused on the influences of three facets of globalization, \nwhich are migration, North-South trade, and direct foreign investment. Heshmati (2003) \nfound  that  the  Kearney  globalization  index  published  by  the  Foreign  Policy magazine \ndescribes only 7\u201311 % of the variations in income inequality. Harjes (2007) suggested \nthat  general  trends  associated  with  globalization,  such  as  technological  changes  \nand  trade  liberalization,  may  not  be  key  drivers  of  income  inequality.  Ruffin  (2009) \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK. H. Park \n\nsuggested  that  globalization  tends  to  improve  global  income  inequality  since  poorer \ncountries  tend  to  benefit  more  from  the  exchange  because  of  cheaper  living  costs. \nSeeing  the  heterogeneous  results  of  the  aforementioned  empirical  findings,  our \nresearch  tries  to  redefine  the  connection  between  education  and  income  inequality  in \nthe  framework  of  an  ever  more  globalized  and  integrated  world  economy,  using \nexpanded and updated data, with a focus on the Asian and Pacific areas. \n\n3.  EDUCATION ATTAINMENT AND EDUCATION \n\nINEQUALITY IN ASIA \n\nBarro  and  Lee  (2010)  updated  their  existing  panel  data  set  of  1993  and  2001  on \neducational attainment for 146 countries from 1950 to 2010. This new data set includes \n31 Asian and Pacific (hereafter Asian) countries. In 1950, the Asian population aged 15 \nand  over had  an  average 2.59 years  of  schooling, increasing steadily to 5.24 years in \n1980  and  8.29  years  in  2010.  Compared  to  the  world  population  aged  15  and  over, \nAsian countries started at a lower level than the world average of 3.2 years in 1950, but \nreached  a  higher  level  than  the  world  average  of  7.8  years  in  2010.  Figure  2  shows \naverage  years  of  schooling  over  time  by  education  level,  indicating  steady  growth  in \naverage  years  of  schooling  over  time  in  all  three  levels  of  education:  primary, \nsecondary, and tertiary. \n\nFigure 2: Average Years of Schooling by Education Level: Asia \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK. H. Park \n\nEducational  inequality  can  be  obtained  by  the  following  education  Gini  formula \nproposed  by  Thomas,  Wang  and  Fan  (2003)  with  the  mutually  exclusive  and \ncollectively inclusive seven categories  of Barro  and Lee (2010). The seven categories \nare  nonschooling,  partial  primary  education,  complete  primary  education,  partial \nsecondary  education,  complete  secondary  education,  partial  higher  education,  and \ncomplete higher education. \n\nEDGini = 1/ \u00b5 \u2211 \u2211 pi | yi \u2013 yj | pj \n\nwhere  EDGini  represents  the  education  Gini  index  derived  from  the  dispersion  of \neducational  attainment,  \u00b5  is  the  mean  years  of  education  for  the  relevant  population,  \npi  and  pj  represent  the  proportions  of  population  with  specified  levels  of  education,  \nyi and yj are the years of education at different educational attainment levels, and n = 7 \nwhere  it  indicates  the  number  of  levels/categories  in  education  attainment  data.  The \ncross-country pattern  of the distribution  of  education in Figure 3  shows that education \nGini  coefficients  decline  continuously  as  the  average  years  of  schooling  increase  \nover time.  \n\nFigure 3: Average Years of Schooling and Education Inequality: Asia \n\nThis inverse relationship between  educational  attainment and educational  inequality is \nconfirmed  not  only  over  time  (Figure  3),  but  also  across  countries  in  2010  (Figure  4). \nThe only outlier from this pattern is Cambodia.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK.

INCOME INEQUALITY IN ASIA \n\nThe World  Income  Inequality  Database  (WIID)  provides  the  most  comprehensive  set  \nof  income  inequality  statistics  available  for  developed,  developing,  and  transition \ncountries. The WIID3.3, released in 2015, covers 175 countries for the period 1950 to \n2012 for most countries. However, the data set, being a collection of data from various \nsources, has missing years for many countries as well as many different observations \nfor the same year.

H. Park \n\nFrom  the  last  column  of  Table  1,  half  of  the  32  countries  listed  actually  experienced \nworsening income distribution. In particular, the Gini coefficient of the PRC jumped by \n12.6 points from 35.5 in 1993 to 48.1 in 2010 while Japan\u2019s Gini coefficient jumped by \n6.2  points  from  24.9  in  1993  to  31.1  in  2009.  Figure  5  presents  all  Gini  coefficient \nestimates  for  the  PRC  collected  by WIID3.3  over  the  period  1964  to  2013,  a  total  of \n152 estimates. A rising income inequality in the PRC over time is clearly exhibited. \n\nFigure 6: Gini Trend in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\nSource: WIDER, World Income Inequality Database 3.3. \n\n \n\nThe  countries  that  recorded  an  improvement  in  their  Gini  coefficients  are  mainly  from \nCentral Asia. They include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  When  they  experienced  drastic  changes  in  their  social  and  economic \nstructures in the process of transition from a command economy to a market economy \nin the 1980s and 1990s, their Gini coefficient initially surged. As their economies have \nstabilized and more income opportunities have become available, their Gini coefficients \nhave  also  steadily  declined.  For  example,  Armenia\u2019s  Gini  coefficient  fluctuated  from \n26.9  in  1986  to  48.2  in  1996  to  36.2  in  2010.  Other  former  Soviet  Union  countries \nsuch as  Georgia,  Kazakhstan,  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  show  a  similar  pattern. \nCambodia also  experienced a similar trend with its regime changes in 1975 and 1997. \nThe  trend  of  Gini  coefficients  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  presented  in  Figure  7  with  a \ntotal  of  47  Gini  coefficient  estimates  between  1981  and  2009,  and  the  graph  clearly \nindicates the presence of the Kuznets Curve, an inverted U-curve.  \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK. H. Park \n\nFigure 7: Gini Trend in Kyrgyz Republic \n\nSource: WIDER, World Income Inequality Database 3.3. \n\n \n\nMost  Asian countries,  except  for  some  Central  Asian  countries,  Cambodia,  and  a  few \nsmall countries, experienced rising income inequality. Zhang, Kanbur and Rhee (2014) \npointed to technological progress, globalization, and market-oriented reform as the key \ndriving factors. These factors helped the rapid growth of developing Asian countries in \nthe last two decades. However, they also had negative effects on income distribution in \nthe region. Technological progress combined with capital-intensive technology tends to \nfavor  skilled  labor  over  unskilled  labor,  increasing  skill  premiums  and causing  income \ninequality.  Globalization  could  favor  particular  regions  (for  example,  coastline  over \ninland  in  the  PRC)  or  particular  industries  (industries  with  comparative  advantage), \nthereby  causing  more  income  inequality.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Stopler-Samuelson \ntheorem  and  \u201cgrowth with  equity\u201d  experiences  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Taipei,China, \nand  Singapore  suggest  improvement  in  income  distribution.  Therefore,  whether \nglobalization  has  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  income  distribution  in  the  Asia  and \nPacific areas will be empirically tested in this study.  \n\nCompared  with  OECD  countries,  Asia\u2019s  income  inequality  is  higher  by  5.46  points  on \naverage. The average Gini coefficient of Asia\u2019s 32 countries around 2010 was 37.46 as \nshown in Figure 8 while the average Gini coefficient of 34 OECD countries was 32 as \nshown  in  Figure  9. While changes  in the  Gini coefficients  in  the OECD countries  over \ntime tend to be mild, many Asian countries experienced drastic surges or drops in their \nGini coefficients between the 1990s and 2010. \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK.

H. Park \n\n5.  MODEL AND VARIABLES \n\nThere  are  different  ways  to  structure  models  to  formulate  the  Kuznets  inverted-U \nhypothesis.  A  characteristic  model  that  numerous  authors  (Park  1996a  for  one)  have \nutilized may be presented as follows: \n\nGini = a0 + a1 ln Y + a2 (ln Y)2 + u \n\n(1) \n\nwhere Gini is the Gini index, an indication of income inequality, ln Y is shorthand for the \nlogarithm  of  income  of  per  capita  GDP,  which  generally  represents  the  level  of \neconomic development, and u is the residual. We expect a positive sign for  a1 while  a \nnegative sign is predicted for a2.  \n\nSeveral  other  independent  variables  that  have  been  incorporated  into  cross-sectional \nstudies  are  included  along  with  the  income  variables  to  better  analyze  income \ninequality.  Two  education  variables  are  added  to  the  model  on  the  basis  of  human \ncapital theory as follows:  \n\nGini = b0 + b1 ln Y + b2 (ln Y)2 + b3 ED + b4 EDGini + u  \n\n(2) \n\nwhere  ED  represents  the  level  of  schooling  or  educational  attainment  and  EDGini \nstands for the dispersion of schooling or educational attainment. \n\nThe human capital theory proposes that the income level of an individual is determined \nby years of education and the rate of return to education. The human capital model as \nexpressed by De Gregorio and Lee (2002) is given below: \n\nln Ys = ln Y0 + \u03a3 ln (1+ ri ) + \u03b5 \n\n(3) \n\nwhere Ys is the income level with s years  of schooling, ri is the rate of return to the ith \nyear  of  schooling,  \u03a3  is  the  summation  from  i=1  to  s  years,  and  \u03b5  is  the  residual. \nEquation  (3)  can  be  approximated  as  ln  Ys  =  ln  Y0 +  r  S  +  \u03b5.  After  making  variance \ntransformation on both sides, the reformulated equation is shown below: \n\nVar (ln Ys) = r2 Var (S) + S\u00b5\n\n2 Var (r) + 2 r S\u00b5 Cov (r,S) + Var (\u03b5) \n\n(4) \n\nwhere S\u00b5 is the average schooling years. \n\nThis formula obviously indicates the existence of a direct correlation between education \ninequality and income inequality. However, the years of schooling has an inconclusive \ninfluence on income inequality. If the level of education (s) and the rate of return (r) are \nindependent,  an  increase  in  the  years  of  schooling  will  make  income  inequality  rise. \nYet,  if  the  covariance  between  the  years  of  schooling  (s)  and  the  rate  of  return  (r)  is \nnegative,  a  rise  in  the  average  years  of  schooling  can  reduce  income  inequality.  So, \nthe sign of b3 is ambiguous while a positive sign is predicted for b4.  \n\nA country\u2019s  globalization  level  and  its  degree  of  freedom,  either  political  or  economic, \nmay influence the distribution of income, especially in the progressively integrated and \nglobalized  world.  Relevant  significant  control  variables  are  added  to  equation  (2)  as \nshown below:  \n\nGini = c0 + c1 ln Y + c2 (ln Y)2 + c3 ED + c4 EDGini +  \n\nc5 FREEDOM + c6 GLOBAL + u  \n\n(5) \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK. H. Park \n\nwhere FREEDOM represents either a country\u2019s degree of economic freedom or degree \nof political freedom, and GLOBAL indicates the degree of globalization of a country.  \n\nThere  are  various  measures  of  income  inequality  and  Park  (1984)  compared  their \nsimilarities and differences. The best-known and most widely used measure of income \ninequality is the Gini coefficient. The WIID (World Income Inequality Database) 3.3 by \nUNU-WIDER  (2015)  has  the  most  extensive  data  collection  on  the  Gini  coefficient, \ncovering a large number of countries in the world for a long period of time. Additionally, \nthe  income  share  of  the  top  20%  of  the  population  (TOP20)  and  the  income  share  of \nthe bottom 40% of the population (BOTTOM40) are utilized as alternative measures of \nthe  income  inequality  variable.  As  a  proxy  variable  for  the  income  level  (or  economic \ndevelopment), the logarithm of per capita GDP is used and the data are from the World \nBank\u2019s World Development Indicators (WDI). One education  variable, the  mean years \nof  schooling  (ED),  is  acquired  from  the  new  data  set  of  educational  attainment  in  the \nworld  1950\u20132010  by  Barro  and  Lee  (2010),  and  the  second  education  variable,  the \ndispersion  of  schooling  (EDGini), is  calculated  by  the  author  according  to  the  formula \ngiven in Section 3, using Barro and Lee\u2019s (2010) data.  \n\nTwo different measures of freedom are used to estimate the variable FREEDOM. First, \nthe  economic  freedom  of  a  country  is  determined  by  the  degree  of  freedom  of \nbusinesses  and  individuals  from  government  restrictions  on  their  economic  activities. \nHow well legal  and institutional systems are structured to preserve  economic freedom \nis  also  considered. Since  1994,  the  index  of  economic  freedom  has  been  published \nannually  by  the  Heritage  Foundation.  Its  publication,  Economic  Freedom,  rates \ncountries  in  the  world  based  on  50  independent  variables  that  are  organized  into  ten \nbroad categories of economic freedom.  \n\nSecond,  political  freedom  is  a  fundamental  factor  of  democracy. A  country\u2019s  political \nfreedom is rated by estimating the degree to which people are unrestricted in the areas \nof  political  rights  and  civil  rights.  Since  1978,  the  index  of  political  freedom  has  been \npublished  annually  by  Freedom  House,  a  New  York-based  nonprofit  organization  that \nmonitors political rights and civil liberties around the world. Its publication, Freedom in \nthe World, lists country rankings by the level of political freedom derived from their data \non such rights and liberties. \n\nAmong the various indices indicating the level of globalization of individual nations, the \nKOF  globalization  index  is  utilized  as  a  proxy  variable  for  globalization.  This  index  is \navailable  for  208  countries  for  the  period  1970  to  2016  and  is  most  suitable  for \nour research  because  it  covers  many  countries  for  a  long  period  of  time.  The  KOF \nglobalization index is based on economic, political, and cultural integration of a country \nin  the  world  and  the  degree  of  personal  contact  across  national  borders.  The  metrics \nfor  economic  integration  include  convergence  of  domestic  and  international  prices, \nmovements  of  goods  and  services,  and  outward-  and  inward-directed  foreign \ninvestment  as  well  as  portfolio  capital  flows.  On  the  other  hand,  the  metrics  for  the \ndegree  of  personal  contact  across  national  borders  include  international  travel, \nmemberships  of  international  organizations,  cross-border  remittances,  Internet  users \nand servers, and international phone calls. \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\n6.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n\nK. H. Park \n\nThe  data  for  income  inequality  are  obtained  from WIID3.3.  Despite  the  improvements \nof WIID data over time, some observations of the Gini index are missing in the data set. \nIn  some  instances,  there  are  discrepancies  in  estimates  for  the  same  country  in  the \nsame year. One possible method to analyze such data with many missing observations \nis  to  do  an  unbalanced  panel  data  analysis.  Therefore,  an  unbalanced  panel  data \nanalysis, with 1990, 2000, and 2010 data, is carried out in this study. The sample size \nis inevitably reduced due to many missing Gini index observations.  \n\nTo eliminate the possibility of reverse causality, we used lagged independent variables. \nWhile  1990,  2000,  and  2010  data  points  are  used  for  independent  variables,  the \ndependent variables, Gini, TOP20, and BOTTOM40, are from data of a few years later \n(at least 2\u20133 years) than 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively. \n\nTable  2  shows  the  regression  results  of  estimating  equation  (1).  The  empirical  results \nsupported the Kuznets hypothesis. We observe an inverse U-shaped curve relationship \nfor  Gini  and  TOP20,  while  BOTTOM40  exhibits  a  U-shaped  curve  relationship.  We \nobtained  the  predicted  signs  for  all  coefficients,  and  most  of  them  are  statistically \nsignificant  at the  5%  level,  regardless  of  whether  Gini, TOP20  or BOTTOM40  is  used \nas  the  dependent  variable.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  panel  data,  the  sizes  of  the \nadjusted R2 statistic tend to be small.  \n\nTable 2: Regression of Income Inequality on Income  \n\n \n\nConstant \n\nln Y \n\n(ln Y)2 \n\nN \nAdj.

These  two  added  explanatory  variables  are  the  mean  years  of  schooling  and \ndispersion of schooling (or inequality in education). The mean years of schooling of the \nlabor force (ED) is used  as  a proxy variable for the  educational attainment level. As  a \nproxy variable for the dispersion of educational attainment, EDGini is calculated by the \nauthor from Barro and Lee\u2019s (2010) data of educational attainment. \n\nThe  regression  results  in  Table  3, which include these  additional  education  variables, \nED  and  EDGini,  are  quite  different  from  the  results  in  Table  2.  First,  inclusion  of  \nthe  additional  variables  raised  the  adjusted  R2  statistic,  thereby  contributing  to \nimprovement in the explanatory power  of the model. Second, both education variables \nhave  significant  effects  on  income  inequality  while  the  magnitude  and  significance  of \nthe  income  variables  declined,  as  can  be  seen  from  the  smaller  and  less  significant \ncoefficients of both ln Y and (ln Y)2. A negative and significant coefficient of ED on Gini \nand TOP20 indicates that a higher level of schooling reduces overall income inequality \n(lower  Gini  index  and  lower  TOP  20%  income  share)  while  a  positive  and  significant \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK.

On the other hand, \na  positive  effect  of  EDGini  on  GINI  and  TOP20  and  a  negative  effect  of  EDGini  on \nBOTTOM40 indicate that the larger the dispersion  of schooling, the more  unequal the \ndistribution of income.  \n\nTable 3: Regression of Income Inequality on Income and Education Variables  \n\n \n\nConstant \n\nln Y \n\n(ln Y)2 \n\nED \n\nEDGini \n\nN \nAdj.

To measure a country\u2019s freedom, the economic freedom index published \nby  the  Heritage  Foundation  as  well  as  the  political  freedom  index  published  by \nFreedom House  are utilized. To measure the  effect of globalization  of  a country  on its \nincome  inequality,  the KOF  globalization  index  is  utilized.

So, the longitudinal tendency toward rising \nincome inequality may be partially explained by globalization trends. Globalization may \ninfluence  income  inequality  through  technical  changes  favoring  highly  educated  and \nskilled workers with bias against unskilled workers, causing wider wage differentials. \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fTable 4: Regression of Income Inequality on Income,  \nEducation, and Globalization  \n\n \n\nADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nConstant \n\nln Y \n\n(ln Y)2 \n\nED \n\nEDGini \n\nN \nAdj.

CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS \n\nEducation  has  been  a  crucial  factor  in  economic  and  social  policies  because  of  its \npotential  to  promote  economic  and  social  progress  for  the  individual  as  well  as  the \ncountry  as  a  whole.  Historically,  education  as  human  capital  investment  and  its  effect \non  economic  growth  have  been  major  subjects  of  concern  for  scholars  as  well  as \npolicymakers. Lately, the importance of establishing the relationship between education \nand income and between education and income distribution has gained prominence. \n\nIn our paper, we deliver  evidence on how the education level and education inequality \ninfluence income inequality in the Asian and Pacific areas, based on the panel data  of \n1990, 2000, and 2010. Results from the panel data analysis indicate that a higher level \nof schooling of the population has reduced income inequality while a greater dispersion \nof  schooling  among  the  population  has  increased  income  inequality. We  support  the \npresence  of  the  inverted-U  curve  when  only  the  income  variables  are  included  in \nthe model  as  independent  variables.  Then  again,  the  effect  of  the  income  variables \nbecomes  weaker  and  statistically  less  significant  when  two  additional  educational \nvariables,  specifically  the  average  years  of  schooling  and  the  dispersion  of  schooling, \nare incorporated into the model.  \n\nWe  also  studied  the  effects  of  freedom  and  globalization  on  income  distribution.  Our \nanalysis  demonstrates  that  an  increasing  degree  of  globalization  results  in  increasing \ninequality  in  income  distribution.  However,  freedom,  either  political  or  economic,  has \nonly  limited  impacts  on  the  distribution  of  income.  With  the  adjusted  R2  ranging \nbetween  0.4  and  0.5,  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  changes  in  income  inequality \nacross countries still remain unexplained. To identify additional determinants of income \ninequality, further study is warranted. \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nK. H. Park \n\nThis  study  offers  policy  implications  on  how  to  improve  income  distribution.  The  chief \nfinding  of  this  study  is  that  education  plays  a  significant  role  in  reducing  income \ninequality. If a government plans to improve the distribution of income, it is suggested \nthat  government  policymakers  focus  on  education  policies  that  promote  educational \nexpansion  while  affording  individuals  equal  and  greater  access  to  educational \nopportunities. Educational expansion with less dispersion of schooling is also identified \nby  Park  (1998)  as  a  major  factor  contributing  to  economic  growth.  Government \npolicymakers  need  to  monitor  the  dispersion  of  educational  attainment  because \neducation  expansion  under  certain  circumstances  may  produce  an  increase  in \neducation inequality. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  as  changes  in  educational  attainment  and  dispersion  of  schooling \ntake longer, this indirect and long-term education policy needs to be supplemented by \na more direct and short-term government policy focusing on  a progressive income tax \nstructure  and  transferring  benefits  to  the  poor.  Some  argue  that  redistributive  policies \nhave  a  tendency  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  economic  growth.  However,  equitable \ndistribution  may  not  necessarily  be  detrimental  to  economic  growth  as  Japan; \nTaipei,China;  and  Republic  of  Korea  represent  a  few  cases  of  achieving  both  equity \nand economic growth with their emphasis on education in their economic development \nprocess.  Equity  and  growth  can  be  achieved  through  an  optimal  mix  of  long-term \neducation policies and short-term redistributive government policies.  \n\nThis  study  also  confirms  the  important  role  played  by  globalization  in  determining \nincome inequality. The difficulty in establishing relationships comes from the complexity \nof  globalization  measurements.  The  globalization  index  is  comprised  of  numerous \nelements  of  globalization,  such  as  movements  of  goods  and  services,  inward  and \noutward  foreign  direct  investment  as  well  as  portfolio  capital  flows,  convergence  of \ndomestic and international prices, international travel, etc. To discover which elements \nplay  important  roles  in  determining  income  inequality,  further  research  on  different \ncomponents of globalization would be required. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 732 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nK.
