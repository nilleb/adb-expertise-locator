This  is  particularly  true  in  the  current  global \n\nfinancial  crisis,  where  issues  of  systemic  risk  have  not  only \n\nnational, but regional and global implications. The contributions \n\nof  these  institutions  and  markets  to  the  development  and \n\nworsening  of  the  crisis  suggest  that  they  need  to  be  monitored \n\nand regulated more closely, but there is still disagreement about \n\nthe degree of regulation that is needed.\n\nThis  policy  brief  examines  hedge  funds,  private  equity  funds, \n\nand  innovative  financial  products,  particularly  collateralized \n\ndebt obligations and asset-backed securities, as the latter are at \n\nthe heart of the freeze up of various financial markets. What is \n\nthe overall structure of these products? What role did they play \n\nin  the  development  of  the  current  global  financial  crisis?  What \n\nchanges are needed in the global financial architecture related to \n\nthese  institutions  and  products  to  strengthen  financial  stability \n\ngoing forward?\n\n0 2   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\f2.\n\nHedge Funds and \nPrivate Equity Funds\n\nHedge  funds  and  private  equity  funds  have  frequently  been \n\nregarded as potential sources of systemic risk, given their lack of \n\nregulation  and  reporting  requirements,  high  exposure  to \n\ninternational financial markets, high degree of leverage, and, in \n\nthe  case  of  hedge  funds,  the  high  rate  of  turnover  in  their \n\nportfolios  and  their  reliance  on  complex  investment  strategies. \n\nIn this section, we examine the structure, performance, and role \n\nin  the  current  global  financial  crisis  of  hedge  funds.  On  the \n\nwhole,  we  found  that  they  did  not  play  a  significant  role  in \n\ncausing  the  crisis,  although  selling  pressure  emanating  from \n\nthem  did  serve  to  amplify  downward  pressure  on  financial \n\nmarkets at a later stage of the crisis.\n\nA. Hedge Funds\n\nThere is no widely agreed-upon definition of hedge funds, and, in \n\nfact,  many  of  these  funds  do  not  use  \u201chedging\u201d  to  manage  risk. \n\nThey  do,  however,  share  a  number  of  defining  characteristics. \n\nMost  importantly,  they  are  investment  funds  that  accept  funds \n\nonly  from  very  large  investors  (e.g.,  in  the  United  States  [US], \n\nindividuals  with  US$5  million  or  more  in  investment  assets). \n\nThis allows them to avoid most, if not all regulations that apply \n\nto investment funds catering to smaller investors. For example, \n\nhedge  funds  typically  are  not  required  to  register  with  the \n\nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  in  the  US,  although \n\nUnited Kingdom (UK)-based funds are required to register with \n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   0 3\n\n\fthe Financial Services Agency in the UK. Hedge funds typically \n\ninvest in a broad range of investments, including equities, debt, \n\nand  commodities;  invest  in  many  international  markets;  and \n\nmake  both  long  and  short  investments.  They  also  generally \n\nadopt  various  sophisticated \n\ninvestment  strategies  using \n\nstructured products. Hedge funds typically have absolute-return \n\ninvestment  targets  and  fee  structures  highly  geared  to  those \n\nreturns,  and,  most  relevantly  for  financial  stability  issues, \n\nemploy leverage to enhance those returns.\n\nAvailable data on hedge fund assets show that they rapidly rose \n\nfrom about US$324 billion in 1999 to US$2.2 trillion in 2007, an \n\nannual average growth rate of 23%. In 2008, the total number of \n\nhedge  funds  fell  9%  to  about  10,000  (International  Financial \n\nServices London 2009). The level of assets, however, collapsed to \n\nonly  US$1.5  trillion  by  the  end  of  2008,  reflecting  declines  in \n\nboth  market  value  and  redemptions.  Moreover,  the  level  could \n\nhave  been  even  lower,  as  some  hedge  funds  adopted  \u201clock-up\u201d \n\nprovisions  that  temporarily  prevented  redemptions  by  their \n\ninvestors.\n\nPerhaps  the  most  counterintuitive  finding  about  hedge  funds  is \n\nthat their overall average leverage ratio is not very high, hitting \n\na  near-term  high  of  about  190%  in  2007,  and  falling  to  about \n\n120%  in  2008  (McGuire  and  Tsatsaronis  2008).  In  contrast, \n\nregulated commercial and investment  banking  institutions  had, \n\nin  some  cases,  far  higher  leverage  ratios  of  about  20  times  or \n\nmore. These included Citigroup (19.2 times), Goldman Sachs (28 \n\ntimes) and Morgan Stanley (33 times) (Wall Street Journal 2008).\n\n0 4   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fB. Private Equity Funds\n\nPrivate  equity  funds  are  similar  to  hedge  funds  in  their \n\nstructure  and  regulation.  However,  they  differ  substantially \n\nfrom  hedge  funds  in  terms  of  their  investment  period  and \n\ninvestment  assets.  \u201cGenerally,  \u201cprivate  equity\u201d  refers  to  a  wide \n\nrange  of  alternative  investments,  including  equity  investments \n\nin  unquoted  companies;  venture  investing  at  early  and  late \n\nstages; large-size and mid-size buyout investing; mezzanine debt \n\nand  mezzanine  equity  investments;  special  situations;  and \nfinally  real  estate  investments.  Private  equity  also  includes \n\nprivately negotiated investments in public companies. A \u201cprivate \n\nequity fund\u201d refers to a limited partnership in which the general \n\npartners invest in private equities on behalf of the fund\u2019s limited \n\npartners.  Private  equity  funds  tend  to  have  a  fixed  life  of  10  to \n\n12  years.  The  funds  are  self-liquidating  structures;  that  is, \n\ngeneral  partners  invest  the  raised  funds  within  three  to  five \n\nyears  of  the  inception.  As  investments  are  divested,  the  cash \n\nrealizations  are  distributed  to  the  limited  partners  over  time.\u201d \n\n(Erturk, Cheung, and Fong 2001) Private equity funds typically \n\ntake  a  direct  equity  stake  in  companies  that  they  regard  as \n\nhaving good long-term prospects. Therefore, unlike hedge funds, \n\ntheir  portfolios  are  quite  illiquid  and  stable  from  year  to  year. \n\nLike hedge funds, private equity funds typically employ leverage \n\nto  enhance  returns.  The  degree  of  leverage  varies  with  market \n\nconditions, but, between 2000 and 2005, debt averaged between \n\n59%  and  68%  of  the  total  purchase  price  for  leveraged  buyouts \n\n(LBOs) in the US (Trenwith Group 2006).\n\nFunds  managed  by  private  equity  funds  also  rose  rapidly  over \n\nthe  past  decade,  going  from  about  US$40  billion  in  2000  to \n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   0 5\n\n\fUS$500  billion  in  2007,  an  annual  growth  rate  of  31%,  but \n\nfalling  to  US$440  billion  in  2008  (International  Financial \n\nServices London 2008). Again, the \u201cequilibrium\u201d amount is likely \n\nto  be  significantly  lower,  because  many  investors  would  have \n\npreferred to sell, but were locked into forced contributions when \n\nanticipated returns from earlier years did not materialize. Also, \n\nin  many  cases  these  funds  are  still  sitting  on  large  amounts  of \n\ncash, since the market for LBOs has collapsed.\n\nUnlike  loans  to  hedge  funds,  the  outstanding  amount  of \n\nleveraged  loans  issued  in  connection  with  LBOs  increased \n\nslightly  to  US$600  billion  in  2008  (Standard  and  Poor\u2019s  2009). \n\nHowever, this increase largely reflects the long lock-up period for \n\nprivate  equity  funds.  Nonetheless,  the  share  of  \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d \n\nand second lien loans in total loans began to shrink in mid-2007, \n\nreflecting  tightening  credit  conditions  and  reduced  appetite  for \n\nrisky loans.\n\nC. Role of Highly Leveraged Funds in the Financial Crisis\n\nPrior  to  the  current  global  financial  crisis,  concerns  about \n\nsystemic  risk  arising  from  highly  leveraged  investors  centered \n\non  two  categories\u2014direct  losses  of  core  institutions  on \n\ncounterparty exposures to such investors, and indirect losses on \n\nbanks\u2019  trading  positions  caused  by  forced  liquidation  of  hedge \n\nfunds\u2019 positions. In fact, however, hedge funds were not a major \n\ncontributing  factor  to  the  start  of  the  current  crisis.  Of  greater \n\nsignificance were the direct losses experienced by internal funds \n\nof  investment  banks  and  the  warehoused  assets  of  banks. \n\nIndirect losses attributable to hedge funds started to become an \n\nimportant  issue  in  2008,  when  hedge  funds  became  large-scale \n\n0 6   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fforced  sellers  to  meet  redemption  demands  by  investors  in \n\nresponse  to  the  overall  decline  in  financial  markets.  Thus,  the \n\ncurrent  crisis  differs  from  that  of  the  Long  Term  Capital \n\nManagement  (LTCM)  crisis  of  1998,  when  both  direct  and \n\nindirect losses arising from LTCM\u2019s failure were seen as having \n\nsystemic  risk  implications.  This  suggests  that  regulation  of \n\nhedge  funds  and  private  equity  funds  is  not  an  urgent  issue, \n\nalthough  issues  of  monitoring  and  regulation  need  to  be \n\nconsidered carefully.\n\nD. Reform Proposals\n\nThere is no consensus yet on whether to regulate hedge funds and \n\nprivate  equity  funds,  although  most  recommendations  focus  on \n\nstepping  up  monitoring  and  communication  rather  than  on \n\nincreasing  regulation.  The  Financial  Stability  Forum  (FSF) \n\nreleased its most recent reports on highly leveraged institutions in \n\nMay  and  October  of  2007  (Financial  Stability  Forum  2007a, \n\n2007b).  These  maintained  the  stance  of  not  calling  for  regulation \n\nof  these  entities.  Instead,  the  reports  called  on  authorities  to \n\nincrease  their  surveillance  and  monitoring  of  the  risk \n\nmanagement activities of core institutions, and called on the hedge \n\nfund  industry  to  review  and  enhance  existing  sound  practice \n\nbenchmarks for hedge fund managers in the light of expectations \n\nfor improvement set out by the official and private sectors.\n\nThe  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  has  taken  a \n\nsimilar approach, putting most of its emphasis on strengthening \n\nguidelines for estimating capital at risk in banks\u2019 trading books \n\nand  making  enhancements  to  the  Basel  II  framework  (Basel \n\nCommittee  on  Banking  Supervision  2009a,  2009b).  This  is  also \n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   0 7\n\n\fimplied  by  the  conclusions  of  the  so-called  de  Larosi\u00e8re \n\nreport  issued  in  February  of  this  year,  which  is  the  most \n\nrecent  comprehensive  European  statement  of  regulatory \n\nrecommendations  emanating  from  the  current  crisis  (European \n\nCommission  2009b).  The  report  states,  for  example:  \u201cIf  banks \n\nengage  in  proprietary  activities  for  a  significant  part  of  their \n\ntotal  activities,  much  higher  capital  requirements  will  be \n\nneeded.\u201d (European Commission 2009b: 17)\n\nThis  is  consistent  with  the  experience  that  the  activities  of  the \n\nregulated banks themselves were the key factor behind the current \n\ncrisis. However, the European Commission has indicated that it will \n\npublish  a  \u201ccomprehensive  legislative  instrument  establishing \n\nregulatory  and  supervisory  standards  for  hedge  funds,  private \n\nequity and other systemically important market players.\u201d (European \n\nCommission  2009a:  7)  The  Group  of  Twenty  (G20)  communiqu\u00e9  of \n\nApril 2009 noted its agreement \u201cto extend regulation and oversight \n\nto all systemically important financial institutions, instruments and \n\nmarkets. This will include, for the first time, systemically important \n\nhedge funds.\u201d (Group of Twenty 2009)\n\nThe  FSF  also  noted  that  the  issuance  of  draft  best  practice \n\nstandards by the UK-based Hedge Fund Working Group, which \n\ninclude  a  \u201ccomply  or  explain\u201d  expectation,  was  a  notable  step \n\ntoward improved transparency and discipline, and represented a \n\nrecognition  by  the  sector  of  its  responsibilities  as  a  significant \n\nforce in the financial system (Hedge Fund Working Group 2008). \n\nHowever,  the  lack  of  uptake  within  the  hedge  fund  industry  of \n\nthese  recommended  principles  has  been  disappointing,  and \n\nleaves open the door to regulation imposed from outside.\n\n0 8   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fThe  approach  of  regulators  to  hedge  funds  is  guided  by  their \n\ndesire to reduce the procyclicality of the financial system and its \n\ntendency  to  boom  and  bust.  In  particular,  there  are  concerns \n\nabout the feedback loops between bubbles or bubble collapses in \n\nasset  prices  and  their  impacts  on  the  real  economy.  To  address \n\nthese  concerns,  the  FSF,  in  cooperation  with  the  Bank  for \n\nInternational  Settlements,  Basel  Committee  on  Banking \n\nSupervision,  Committee  on  the  Global  Financial  System,  and \n\nother  international  bodies,  is  examining  ways  to  mitigate \nprocyclicality.  The  focus  of  the  study  is  on  capital  regulations, \n\nloan-loss  provisioning,  interaction  of  valuation  standards  and \n\nleverage,  and  compensation  practices.  One  approach  being \n\nexplored  is  the  use  of  \u201cthrough-the-cycle\u201d  estimates  of  asset \n\nvalues.  In  addition,  the  group  recommends  that  regulators \n\nclosely  monitor  the  activities  of  large  hedge  funds  with  a \n\npotential  for  systemic  risk  and  maintain  an  ongoing  dialogue \n\nwith those firms.\n\nThe group also supports the development of a macro-prudential \n\nframework  to  monitor  and  address  the  buildup  of  risk  in  the \n\nfinancial system. Hedge funds and private equity funds are to be \n\nincluded  in  the  monitoring  process.  The  approach  likely  to  be \n\nadopted  is  similar  to  that  of  the  UK\u2019s  Financial  Services \n\nAuthority,  which  focuses  on  identifying  the  potential  for \n\nsystemic  risk.  Another  approach  being  widely  considered  is  to \n\nmodify the framework for monetary policy to place more weight \n\non  the  importance  of  asset  price  movements.  Nonetheless, \n\nfurther  direct  regulatory  requirements  on  hedge  funds  and \n\nprivate equity funds cannot be ruled out.\n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   0 9\n\n\f3.\n\nInnovative Products\n\nInnovative  financial  products  have  played  a  key  role  in  the \n\ndevelopment  of  the  current  financial  crisis,  and  have  also \n\ncompounded  the  difficulty  of  resolving  it.  This  is  because  the \n\ndifficulty  of  valuing  such  products  has,  in  many  cases,  caused \n\nmarkets  for  them  to  cease  functioning.  This  has  led  to  great \n\nuncertainty  regarding  the  financial  position  of  institutions \n\nholding these products, which has, in turn, frozen the process of \n\ntrying to separate \u201cgood assets\u201d from \u201cbad assets,\u201d an important \n\nstep  in  restoring  the  normal  functioning  of  credit  markets.  The \n\nmain  innovative  financial  products  relevant  to  the  current \n\nfinancial  crisis  are  derivative  products\u2014mainly  credit  default \n\nswaps (CDS) and asset-backed securities (ABS). (See glossary of \n\nterms in the Appendix.)\n\nA. Derivative Products\n\nDerivative  products,  i.e.,  products  whose  value  is  a  function  of \n\nthe  value  of  other  underlying  financial  products  such  as  stocks, \n\nbonds,  or  loans,  are  a  key  category  of  innovative  products.  The \n\noverall  over-the-counter  market  for  derivative  products  has \n\nexpanded dramatically over the past decade, rising from US$90 \n\ntrillion in 1998 to nearly US$700 trillion by June of last year (in \n\nnotional  amounts)  (Bank  for  International  Settlements  2008b). \n\nMajor  types  of  derivative  instruments  include  those  related  to \n\nforeign  exchange,  interest  rates,  equities,  commodities,  and \n\ncredit default swaps. Table 1 shows that interest rate contracts \n\n1 0   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fare  still  by  far  the  largest  type  of  derivative,  making  up  about \n\ntwo-thirds of the total.\n\nTable 1: Notional Amounts Outstanding of \nOver-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives\n\nUS$ billion, end-period \n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\nJune 2008\n\nTotal contracts  \n\n95,200  297,666  414,845  595,341 \n\n683,725\n\nForeign exchange \ncontracts  \nInterest rate contracts  \nEquity-linked contracts \nCommodity contracts  \nCredit default swaps \nUnallocated  \n\nNote: - = information not available.\n\n15,666 \n\n31,360 \n\n40,271  56,238 \n\n62,983\n\n64,668  211,970  291,582  393,138 \n8,469 \n8,455 \n28,650  57,894 \n39,740  71,146 \n\n5,793 \n5,434 \n13,908 \n29,199 \n\n1,891 \n662 \n- \n12,313 \n\n7,488 \n7,115 \n\n458,304\n10,177\n13,229\n57,325\n81,708\n\nSource: Bank for International Settlements (2008a).\n\nAmong derivatives, credit default swaps have been the greatest \n\nsource  of  systemic  risk.  A  credit  default  swap  is  a  financial \n\ncontract  in  which  the  protection  buyer  (risk  shedder)  pays  a \n\nfixed  periodic  fee  in  return  for  a  contingent  payment  by  the \n\nprotection  seller  (risk  taker).  The  contingent  payment  is \n\ntriggered by a credit event of the entity that the contract refers \n\nto.  Credit  events,  which  are  specified  in  CDS  contracts,  may \n\ninclude  bankruptcy,  default,  or  restructuring.  On  a  gross \n\nnotional  basis,  CDS  grew  from  negligible  amounts  in  1998  to \n\nUS$58  trillion  by  December  2007  (about  10%  of  the  total), \n\nalthough they fell substantially last year to US$32 trillion (The \n\nDepository  Trust  and  Clearing  Corporation  2009).  The  gross \nnotional value is the total value of potential payouts specified in \n\nthe  contract.  However,  the  net  notional  level,  defined  when  a \n\ncredit  event  actually  takes  place,  is  much  lower,  at  only  about \n\n3%  of  the  gross  notional  value  (The  Depository  Trust  and \n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   1 1\n\n\fClearing Corporation 2009). This is because firms often both buy \n\nand sell protection on the same company, so the net exposure is \n\nreduced  accordingly.  The  use  of  \u201ctrade  compression,\u201d  which \n\nreplaces existing trades with a smaller number having the same \n\npayoff structure, is one factor behind the recent decline in gross \n\nnotional value.\n\nThis lower net estimate for risk exposure has held for individual \n\nmajor bankruptcies as well. For example, in the case of Lehman \nBrothers, the gross notional value was US$72 billion, but the net \n\npayment  was  only  US$5.2  billion  (Bank  for  International \n\nSettlements  2008b).  This  figure  is  not  very  large,  but  the  main \n\nproblem for Lehman Brothers was its exposure to collateralized \n\ndebt  obligations  (CDOs),  not  to  CDS.  Moreover,  CDS  markets \n\nbasically behaved as they were meant to, absorbing these losses \n\nand not freezing up the way CDO markets did.\n\nB. Asset-Backed Securities\n\nThe  main  source  of  instability  and  uncertainty  for  financial \n\nmarkets  has  been  the  valuation  of  ABS,  especially  mortgage-\n\nbacked  securities.  Traditional  ABS  are  backed  by  the  credit \n\nobligations  of  individuals,  such  as  residential  mortgage  loans, \n\nauto  loans,  and  credit  card  balances.  Securities  backed  by \n\nresidential  mortgage  loans  are  called  residential  mortgage-\n\nbacked securities. In the case of mortgages bought by the three \n\ngovernment home mortgage loan agencies (the Federal National \n\nMortgage Association [FNMA or Fannie Mae], the Federal Home \n\nLoan  Mortgage  Corporation  [FHLMC  or  Freddie  Mac],  and  the \n\nGovernment  National  Mortgage  Association  [GNM  or  Ginnie \n\nMae]),  they  are  referred  to  as  agency  mortgage-backed \n\n1 2   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fsecurities.  CDOs  are  similar  in  structure,  but  typically  are \n\nbacked by investment-grade corporate loans and/or bonds. These \n\ninclude collateralized loan obligations, which are based on loans, \n\nand  collateralized  bond  obligations,  which  are  based  on  bonds. \n\nThe outstanding levels of these assets originating in the US and \n\nEurope are summarized in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Securitized Assets Outstanding by Region (end-2008)\n\nUS$ billion  \n\nUS  \n\nEurope\n\nAsset-backed securities (ABS) \n\nAgency mortgage-backed securities (MBS)  \n\nNon-agency residential mortgage-backed \nsecurities (RMBS)  \n\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) \n\nCollateralized debt obligations (CDO) \n\nWhole business securitization (WBS)  \n\nTotal  \n\nNotes: (i) US figures for ABS include CDOs\n \n\n(ii) - = information not available\n\nSource: European Securitisation Forum (2008).\n\n1,275 \n\n1,487\n\n2,658 \n\n5,048 \n\n626 \n\n- \n\n- \n\n267\n\n-\n\n192\n\n414\n\n55\n\n9,607 \n\n2,415\n\nThe bulk of securitized assets were originated in the US (about \n\nUS$9.6  trillion  out  of  a  total  of  US$12  trillion  at  the  end  of \n\n2008).  Agency  MBS,  i.e.,  those  originated  by  Freddie  Mac, \n\nFannie  Mae,  and  Ginnie  Mae,  made  up  just  over  half  of  that \n\ntotal  (US$5.0  trillion).  Assets  originating  in  Europe  totaled \n\nUS$2.4  trillion,  the  bulk  of  which  were  residential  mortgage-\n\nbacked securities (European Securitisation Forum 2008).\n\nC. Role of Innovative Products in the Crisis\n\nAs  described  above,  the  CDS  market  performed  fairly  well \n\nduring the crisis period. However, there has been criticism that \n\nbuyers  of  CDS  used  short-selling  of  stocks  as  a  hedge  against \n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   1 3\n\n\flosses, thereby aggravating market downturns. The main victim \n\nof CDS during the crisis was the insurer American International \n\nGroup (AIG), which suffered total losses of US$99 billion in 2008 \n\nand  had  to  be  effectively  nationalized  by  the  US  government. \n\nAIG\u2019s  decline  was  triggered  by  losses  on  its  portfolio  of \n\nmortgage-backed  securities  held  by  its  financial  products \n\nsubsidiary,  which  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  AIG\u2019s  capital \n\nreserves. This decline in capital reserves, in turn, led Standard & \n\nPoor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service to downgrade AIG from an \nAAA  to  an  A  rating.  These  downgrades  then  triggered \n\ncollateralization  requirements  under  AIG\u2019s  CDS  contracts, \n\nwhich  were  estimated  to  total  US$450  billion.  The  amount  of \n\ncollateral  that  AIG  had  to  produce  was  about  US$100  billion, \n\nwhich it simply did not have. In other words, AIG\u2019s whole model \n\nwas based on the company preserving its AAA rating.\n\nThe main contribution of these products to the worsening of the \n\ncrisis  was  that  the  markets  for  various  kinds  of  asset-backed \n\nsecurities products froze up due to the difficulty of valuing such \n\nproducts.  The  lack  of  a  functioning  market  for  these  assets \n\ncontributed  greatly  to  market  uncertainty  about  the  financial \n\nposition of many financial institutions, and complicated attempts \n\nto  aid  those  institutions.  This  undermined  the  banks\u2019  originate-\n\nto-distribute  model,  which  has  made  it  much  more  difficult  for \n\nthem  to  increase  lending,  as  it  means  they  have  been  unable  to \n\nmove existing loans off their balance sheets. For example, mutual \n\nfunds  stopped  buying  CDOs  after  some  money-market  fund \n\nvalues dropped below par due to losses incurred on those CDOs.\n\n1 4   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fThe  most  spectacular  bankruptcy  arising  from  these  losses  and \n\nmarket  freeze-ups  was  that  of  Lehman  Brothers  in  September \n\n2008. At the time of its collapse, it was estimated to hold about \n\nUS$54  billion  worth  of  mortgage-backed  securities,  while \n\nreporting only US$26 billion worth of equity in its last quarterly \n\nreport  for  the  period  ending  May  2008.  Even  that  equity \n\nestimate  was  somewhat  overstated.  If  the  company\u2019s  mortgage-\n\nbacked  securities  had  lost  half  of  their  value,  a  not  unlikely \n\nscenario, it would have wiped out the firm\u2019s equity, even without \ntaking other losses into account.\n\nThe  direct  impact  on  financial  institutions  in  Asia  of  the  losses \n\narising  from  asset-backed  securities  was  limited  due  to  their \n\nrelatively small holdings of these assets. US and European bank \n\nlosses  arising  from  holdings  of  such  assets  amounted  to  about \n\nUS$910 billion as of June 2009 (Reuters 2009). Including losses \n\nfrom  other  financial  institutions,  the  total  is  likely  to  have \n\nreached  about  US$1.1  trillion.  However,  losses  by  Asian \n\ninstitutions due to such holdings were much smaller, accounting \n\nfor  only  about  3%  of  this  total.  Nevertheless,  the  magnitude  of \n\nthe  losses  has  been  significant  for  some  institutions,  primarily \n\nJapanese banks. Most of the impacts on Asia have been indirect, \n\narising  either  from  a  liquidity  crunch  due  to  a  shortage  of  US \n\ndollars  in  specific  countries,  or  from  the  deterioration  in \n\neconomic  conditions  arising  from  the  sharp  decline  in  export \n\ndemand  across  the  region.  In  some  cases,  particularly  in \n\nSingapore  and  Hong  Kong,  China,  many  individuals  suffered \n\nlosses  on  derivatives-related  savings  products  whose  risks  were \n\noften not adequately explained.\n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   1 5\n\n\fD. Reform Proposals\n\nThe  magnitude  and  widespread  nature  of  the  current  financial \n\ncrisis  highlights  failures  in  many  areas  of  monitoring  and \n\nregulation that need to be analyzed and reformed. These include \n\nregulations  for  origination,  distribution,  and  trading  of \n\nderivatives  and  asset-backed  securities;  gaps  in  regulatory \n\ncoverage;  the  Basel  II  capital  adequacy  rules;  rules  regarding \n\ngovernment  takeover  of  systemically  important  financial \n\ninstitutions  that  are  failing;  the  scope  for  international \ncooperation and surveillance; and the role of rating agencies and \n\nregulators.  Greater  efforts  to  educate  directors,  market \n\nparticipants, regulators, and credit agencies are also needed.\n\nRegarding CDS, reforms should have a number of targets. First, \n\nCDS contracts should be standardized in order to facilitate trade \n\ncompression,  thereby  reducing  the  size  of  the  net  exposure. \n\nSecond,  transactions  should  be  moved  onto  exchanges  run  by \n\ncentralized  clearing  counterparties  (CCPs)  in  order  to  increase \n\ntransparency  and  reduce  counterparty  risk.  This  process  has \n\nstarted.  The  main  question  is  whether  there  will  be  one  or \n\nmultiple  markets.  It  looks  as  though  the  US  and  Europe  will \n\nhave  at  least  one  market  apiece.  The  Tokyo  Stock  Exchange  is \n\nalso developing a CCP, and is looking to establish links between \n\nits  CCP  and  those  in  other  regions.  Even  if  one  single  global \n\nmarket  is  not  feasible,  for  political  and  other  reasons,  markets \n\nought  at  least  to  be  consistent  and  standardized.  Third,  it  is \n\nnecessary  to  revive  securitization  markets,  because  without \n\nthem,  it  will  be  difficult  to  see  a  recovery  in  credit  markets. \n\nFinally,  there  have  been  calls  to  require  banks  that  securitize \n\n1 6   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fdebt  to  hold  a  certain  share  of  such  products  in  order  to \n\nmaintain a degree of risk exposure to such assets. This could be \n\ncounterproductive, however, as part of the problem leading up to \n\nthe  current  financial  crisis  was  that  banks  were  too  willing  to \n\nhold  such  products,  and,  in  fact,  should  have  held  less,  which \n\nwould have reduced their losses considerably.\n\nRegarding  hedging  strategies  involving  short-selling  of  stock  to \n\noffset  buying  of  CDS,  some  have  suggested  that  such  short-\nselling  should  be  banned,  and  this  should  be  examined  further. \n\nSome  countries  already  have  partial  or  blanket  bans  on  short-\n\nselling of stocks, and these should also be reviewed.\n\nHeavy  losses  on  ABS  made  the  greatest  contribution  to \n\ntriggering  and  worsening  the  financial  crisis,  and  hence \n\ndeserve  to  be  paid  the  greatest  attention  in  monitoring  and \n\nregulation activities. As the bulk of ABS were originated in the \n\nUS,  and  the  remainder  came  largely  from  Europe,  the \n\nimmediate  tasks  for  regulation  and  monitoring  should  fall  in \n\nthose  two  regions,  rather  than  in  Asia,  where  there  was  very \n\nlittle  origination  of  ABS.  However,  the  origination  industry \n\nmay  well  take  hold  in  Asia  in  the  future,  and  a  regulatory \n\nframework \n\nis  needed.  This \n\nincludes  requirements \n\nfor \n\nmonitoring  of  the  quality  of  underlying  assets  used  as \n\ncollateral  for  securitization,  requirements  for  disclosure  of \n\ngreater \n\ninformation  to  help  value  such  assets,  and \n\nrequirements \n\nfor  disclosure  by  systemically \n\nimportant \n\ninstitutions  of  their  holdings  of  securitized  products.  Perhaps \n\nmore  relevantly  for  Asia,  there  needs  to  be  greater  disclosure \n\nabout the risks inherent in such assets, and regulation of their \n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   1 7\n\n\fdistribution.  This  is  particularly  important  for  derivative-type \n\nproducts  that  are  sold  to  individual  investors,  such  as  the \n\nLehman Brothers\u2019 so-called mini-bonds.\n\nHeavy  use  of  innovations,  such  as  structured  investment \n\nvehicles  to  escape  regulations  and  keep  assets  off  bank  balance \n\nsheets,  contributed  to  the  huge  expansion  of  the  \u201cshadow \n\nbanking system,\u201d which ended up rivaling regulated banking in \n\nsize  in  the  US.  This  greatly  reduced  transparency  in  the \nfinancial  system  and  the  effective  reach  of  regulators.  There \n\nhave  been  calls  to  oblige  issuers  of  complex  securities  to  retain \n\non  their  books  for  the  life  of  the  instrument  a  meaningful \n\naccount  of  the  underlying  risk  (non-hedged).  However,  some \n\nbanks  got  into  trouble  precisely  because  they  kept  too  many  of \n\nsuch assets on their balance sheets.\n\nMarket  participants  frequently  resorted  to  regulatory  arbitrage \n\nor  made  use  of  gaps  in  existing  relations.  Perhaps  most \n\negregious  was  the  lack  of  supervision  of  the  investment \n\noperations of insurance companies like AIG. US Federal Reserve \n\nChairman Ben Bernanke noted, \u201c\u2026the AIG situation highlights \n\nthe  need  for  strong,  effective  consolidated  supervision  of  all \n\nsystemically  important  financial  firms\u201d  (Bernanke  2009).  There \n\nneeds  to  be  a  thorough  review  of  the  regulatory  architecture  to \n\nensure  that  systemically  important  institutions  are  monitored \n\nand  regulated  in  a  holistic  way,  that  gaps  in  regulation  are \n\neliminated,  and  that  opportunities  for  regulatory  arbitrage  are \n\nlimited.  This  includes  reviewing  the  status  of  offshore  financial \n\ninstitutions. There also needs to be greater monitoring of hedge \n\nfunds  and  other  lightly-regulated  institutions,  and  perhaps \n\n1 8   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\ffurther  regulation  in  the  case  of  systemically  important \n\ninstitutions.\n\nThe  Basel  II  rules  for  bank  capital  adequacy  clearly  failed  to \n\nensure that banks had sufficient capital to deal with the current \n\nfinancial  crisis.  There  needs  to  be  a  general  review  of  where \n\nguidelines  for  capital  fell  short,  particularly  with  regard  to \n\nsystemically  important  institutions.  Capital  requirements  need \n\nto  take  into  account  overall  risk  exposure,  not  just  look  at \nindividual assets in isolation.\n\nThe  international  scope  of  the  crisis,  including  the  activities  of \n\nglobal  banks  and  the  worldwide  distribution  of  innovative  but \n\nopaque  financial  products,  highlights  the  need  for  greater \n\noversight and regulation at the global level. Cooperation among \n\nnational  regulators  needs  to  be  strengthened,  but,  beyond  that, \n\nthere are strong arguments in favor of creating an international \n\nregulatory authority and international \u201ccolleges\u201d of regulators to \n\noversee systemically important global financial institutions.\n\nMore  generally,  the  disastrous  performance  of  financial \n\ninstitutions  as  a  result  of  shifting  to  the  originate-to-distribute \n\nmodel  and  their  reliance  on  complex  securitized  products \n\nsuggests that there was a failure to educate directors, regulators, \n\naccountants, and rating agencies about the risks involved in both \n\nthe model and the products used. Therefore, education efforts in \n\nthis area clearly need to be improved. It may also be desirable to \n\nset up a global task force to monitor new financial products.\n\nFinally,  the  high  reliance  on  risky  securitized  assets  and  off-\n\nbalance-sheet investment vehicles for bank profitability suggests \n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   1 9\n\n\fthat  there  was  a  broad-based  misalignment  of  incentives,  not \n\nonly  in  terms  of  compensation  of  bank  executives,  but  also  for \n\nregulators  and  credit-rating  agencies.  There  was  too  much \n\nemphasis  on  short-term  profitability  and  on  the  use  of  risk \n\nmodels.  Credit  ratings  that  were  derived  from  those  models \n\nwere,  in  hindsight,  clearly  too  optimistic.  These  issues  all  need \n\nto  be  reviewed  as  part  of  a  general  revision  of  the  global \n\nfinancial  architecture.  Accounting  standards;  risk  analysis \n\nprocedures\u2014especially  those  related  to  \u201cvalue-at-risk\u201d  models, \ni.e., model-based estimates of total expected financial losses; and \n\ncredit  rating  procedures  all  failed  broadly  during  this  episode, \n\nand need to be reviewed.\n\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nHedge  funds,  private  equity  funds,  and  innovative  financial \n\nproducts  have  each  raised  significant  concerns  about  financial \n\nstability and the need for increased surveillance and regulation. \n\nHedge  funds  have  figured  prominently  in  this  regard,  due  to \n\ntheir  light  regulation,  lack  of  disclosure,  high  leverage,  and \n\nrapid  turnover  of  portfolios.  There  were  often  concerns  about \n\nboth  direct  losses  of  core  institutions  on  counterparty  (trading) \n\nexposures  to  hedge  funds  and  indirect  losses  on  banks\u2019  trading \n\npositions  caused  by  forced  liquidation  of  hedge  funds\u2019  positions. \n\nSince private equity funds have very illiquid portfolios, concerns \n\nabout them focused on banks\u2019 potential direct losses.\n\n2 0   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fHowever,  most  assessments  of  the  origins  of  the  current  global \n\nfinancial crisis conclude that highly leveraged funds did not play \n\na significant role. This is no doubt partly because their leverage \n\nwas  lower  than  often  assumed,  typically  ranging  between  one \n\nand two times their equity capital. It was only the forced selling \n\nof hedge fund assets due to redemptions that aggravated market \n\ndeclines  later  on,  and  this  phenomenon  was  hardly  limited  to \n\nhedge funds. Instead, the main sources of instability were found \n\nin  the  highly  regulated  banking  sector,  where  leverage  was \nsometimes far higher. Therefore, most assessments focus on the \n\nneed  to  increase  surveillance  of  hedge  funds  and  other  lightly \n\nregulated  entities,  and  to  maintain  dialogues  with  major  hedge \n\nfunds,  although  there  are  increased  calls  for  regulation  of \n\nsystemically important hedge funds.\n\nConcerns  about  innovative  financial  products,  especially \n\nderivative  products  such  as  credit  default  swaps  and  asset-\n\nbacked  securities,  center  on  the  need  for  standards  in  the \n\norigination, distribution, and trading of such products, as well as \n\ntheir  capital  requirements.  In  the  case  of  CDS,  the  market  has \n\nfunctioned  more  or  less  as  expected,  and  losses  associated  with \n\nmajor credit events such as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers \n\nhave  turned  out  to  be  much  smaller  than  implied  by  gross \n\nnotional  exposure  levels.  Proposals  for  reform  center  on \n\nstandardizing  contracts  to  facilitate  trade  compression  and \n\nthereby minimize net exposure, and on moving over-the-counter \n\ntransactions  onto  standardized  exchanges  in  order  to  increase \n\ntransparency.  Capital  requirements  related  to  such  contracts \n\nalso need to be strengthened.\n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   2 1\n\n\fThe  problems  are  much  greater  with  ABS,  where  markets \n\nremain  frozen  due  to  uncertainties  about  valuation  and  the \n\nimplications  of  market-clearing  prices  for  bank  capital. \n\nRegulated banks, with their originate-to-distribute model, lie at \n\nthe  center  of  the  production  process  for  derivative  products.  A \n\nresolution of the valuation problem of asset-backed securities is \n\na  prerequisite  for  restoring  the  capital  adequacy  of  the  bank \n\nsector  and  restarting  the  lending  process.  Monitoring  and \n\nregulation  of  the  origination,  distribution,  and  trading  of  such \nproducts  needs  to  be  strengthened,  and  capital  requirements \n\nneed to be increased.\n\nThe toxic effects of the combination of the originate-to-distribute \n\nbanking  model  and  the  reliance  on  sophisticated  but  opaque \n\nfinancial  instruments  highlighted  widespread  failures  in \n\nregulatory  coverage,  the  Basel  II  capital  adequacy  standards, \n\ninternational  regulatory  cooperation,  corporate  governance, \n\nmanagement incentives, risk management practices, accounting \n\nstandards,  and  the  behavior  of  regulators  and  credit  rating \n\nagencies.  These  issues  all  need  to  be  addressed  as  part  of  the \n\nshift  to  an  improved  global  financial  architecture.  Regulatory \n\ngaps need to be closed, including those at the international level, \n\nand the Basel II capital adequacy rules need to be reviewed and \n\nstrengthened.  The  education  of  all  participants,  including \n\ndirectors,  management,  regulators,  accountants,  and  credit \n\nrating agencies, needs to be strengthened as well.\n\n2 2   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fReferences\n\nBank for International Settlements. 2008a.

The  pool  of \n\nassets  is  typically  a  group  of  small  and  illiquid  assets  that  are \n\nunable  to  be  sold  individually.  Pools  of  underlying  assets  can \n\ninclude  common  payments  from  credit  cards,  auto  loans,  and \n\nmortgage  loans,  to  esoteric  cash  flows  from  aircraft  leases, \n\nroyalty payments, and movie revenues.\n\nCollateralized  bond  obligation:  A  form  of  securitization \n\nwhere  payments  from  multiple  investment-grade  corporate \n\nbonds  are  pooled  together  and  then  subdivided  into  assets  with \n\ndifferent  risk  characteristics  (tranches),  which  are  sold  to \n\ndifferent investor groups.\n\nCollateralized debt obligation (CDO): A security backed by a \n\npool  of  assets,  mainly  non-mortgage  loans  or  bonds,  but  also \n\nother  asset-backed  securities.  CDOs  are  made  up  of  tranches \n\nwith various maturities and risk characteristics, with the equity \n\ntranches  carrying  the  most  risk,  and  therefore  paying  the \n\nhighest interest rate to the buyer. CDOs are basically the same \n\nas  traditional  ABS  in  terms  of  their  structure,  but  differ  from \n\ntraditional ABS with respect to the type of assets underlying the \n\ncollateral pool, the motivation for issuance, and the relationship \n\nbetween  the  borrower  and  the  special  purpose  vehicle.  CDO \n\nasset  pools  typically  consist  of  loans  (collateralized  loan \n\nobligations), higher yield bonds (collateralized bond obligations), \n\nor  a  mixture  of  both.  The  number  of  loans  typically  included  is \n\nmuch  lower  than  in  traditional  ABS  (hundreds  versus \n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   2 5\n\n\fthousands),  and  the  types  of  loans  and  bonds  included  can  be \n\nmuch more diverse than in traditional ABS.\n\nCollateralized loan obligation: A form of securitization where \n\npayments  from  multiple  middle-sized  and  large  business  loans \n\nare pooled together and passed on to different classes of owners \n\nin various tranches.\n\nCommercial  mortgage-backed  security:  A  security  backed \n\nby  one  or  more  pools  of  mortgage  loans  secured  by  commercial \n(non-residential) properties.\n\nCovenant-lite loan: A loan whose main terms have fewer or no \n\nmaintenance  covenants.  A  covenant-lite  loan  does  not  include \n\nthe  legal  clauses  which  allow  a  lender  to  control  and  track  the \n\nperformance  of  a  company  and,  if  need  be,  declare  a  default  if \n\ncertain  criteria  are  breached.  With  covenant-lite  loans,  a  bank \n\ncan only act if a borrower attempts to take specific actions, such \n\nas adding more debt or making an acquisition. More-traditional \n\nmaintenance  covenants  allow  banks  to  step  in  at  any  point  if  a \n\nborrower\u2019s performance drops below a certain benchmark.\n\nCredit derivative: A contract between two parties which uses a \n\nderivative  to  transfer  credit  risk  from  one  party  to  another,  in \n\nexchange for a fee.\n\nCredit  default  swap  (CDS):  A  bilateral  financial  contract  in \n\nwhich  the  protection  buyer  (risk  shedder)  pays  a  fixed  periodic \n\nfee  in  return  for  a  contingent  payment  by  the  protection  seller \n\n(risk  taker),  which  is  triggered  by  a  credit  event  of  a  specified \n\nfirm  or  entity.  Credit  events,  which  are  specified  in  CDS \n\ncontracts, may include bankruptcy, default, or restructuring.\n\n2 6   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fCredit default swap spread: This spread signals the market\u2019s \n\nview  on  a  specified  firm  or  entity\u2019s  likeliness  to  experience  a \n\ncredit event that would trigger a contingent payment. The CDS \n\nspread  is  the  premium  paid  by  the  protection  buyer  (expressed \n\nas  basis  points  per  annum  of  the  notional  amount  of  the  CDS \n\ncontract).  A  CDS  spread  of  500  basis  points  means  that  the \n\nannual  cost  of  protection  with  respect  to  US$1  million  of \n\nspecified underlying debt is US$50,000.\n\nGross  nominal  value  or  gross  notional  value:  Nominal  or \n\nnotional  amounts  outstanding  are  defined  as  the  gross  nominal \n\nor notional value of all deals concluded and not yet settled at the \n\nreporting  date.  The  notional  value  to  be  reported  is  that  of  the \n\nmaximum  default  protection  specified  in  the  contract  itself  and \n\nnot  the  par  value  of  financial  instruments  intended  to  be \n\ndelivered.\n\nMortgage-backed  security:  A  security  backed  by  a  pool  of \n\nmortgage  loans  secured  on  real  property.  Investors  receive \n\npayments  of  interest  and  principle  derived  from  payments \n\nreceived on the underlying mortgage loans.\n\nMacro-prudential  framework:  A  framework  for  preserving \n\nfinancial  stability  that  looks  not  just  at  the  soundness  of \n\nindividual  institutions,  but  also  takes  into  account  the \n\ninteractions among various financial markets and institutions as \n\npossible  sources  of  systemic  risk.  In  other  words,  the  risk  to \n\nfinancial stability of the system as a whole may be greater than \n\nthe sum of the risks to individual institutions.\n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   2 7\n\n\fNet notional value: Net notional balances, as opposed to gross \n\nbalances,  cancel  out  transactions  that  offset  each  other.  For \n\ninstance,  if  an  investment  bank  buys  US$100  million  in  credit-\n\ndefault  swaps  to  protect  against  a  company  default  and  sells \n\nUS$50 million of swaps for protection on the same company, the \n\nnet  notional  value  would  be  US$50  million.  The  International \n\nSwaps  and  Derivatives  Association  (ISDA)  estimates  that  the \n\nnet  notional  value,  which  is  the  amount  at  risk  in  the  CDS \n\nmarketplace, is only 3% of the gross notional value.\n\nOriginate-to-distribute  model:  A  business  model  for  banks \n\nwhereby  banks  make  loans,  but  then  package  them  into \n\nsecurities  in  order  to  sell  them,  thereby  removing  them  from \n\ntheir  balance  sheets.  Having  a  smaller  balance  sheet  enables \n\nbanks to reduce their capital requirements.\n\nProcyclicality:  The  tendency  of  financial  regulations  to \n\nexacerbate the volatility of economic swings. For example, when \n\nthe  economy  turns  down,  banks\u2019  capital  declines,  which  forces \n\nthem  to  reduce  lending  to  maintain  their  capital  adequacy \n\nratios.  However,  this,  in  turn,  puts  further  downward  pressure \n\non the economy, leading to further declines in banks\u2019 capital.\n\nResidential mortgage-backed security: A security backed by \n\na  homogeneous  pool  of  mortgage  loans  secured  on  real \n\nresidential property.\n\nSecond lien loan: A form of loan with a security interest in the \n\nassets  of  a  company  that  is  second  in  ranking  behind  a \n\ntraditional  senior  credit  facility.  The  second  lien  lender  will \n\ntypically  be  required  to  agree  contractually  (through  an \n\n2 8   |  Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation\n\n\fintercreditor  agreement  or  other  contract)  to  subordinate  its \n\nclaims on the assets to the first lien secured lenders.\n\nSpecial  purpose  vehicle  (SPV)  or  Special  purpose  entity \n\n(SPE):  \u201cA  special  purpose  vehicle  (SPV)  or  special  purpose \n\nentity (SPE) is a company that is created solely for a particular \n\nfinancial transaction or series of transactions. It may sometimes \n\nbe something other than a company, such as a trust. The SPV\u2019s \n\ndebts  may,  or  may  not,  be  raised  with  recourse  to  the  \u201creal\u201d \nborrower.  SPVs/SPEs  are  often  used  to  make  a  transaction  tax \n\nefficient  by  choosing  the  most  favourable  tax  residence  for  the \n\nvehicle.  This  is  commonly  done  with  eurobonds  so  that  foreign \n\ninvestors do not have to pay withholding taxes in the borrower\u2019s \n\ncountry of residence.\u201d (Pietersz 2006\u20132009)\n\nStructured investment vehicle: A type of SPE that funds the \n\npurchase  of  its  assets  (mainly  highly-rated  securities)  through \n\nthe issuance of both commercial-paper and medium-term notes. \n\nStructured  investment  vehicles  are  offshore  entities,  and \n\ntherefore  escape  the  regulations  that  banks  and  finance \n\ncompanies are subject to.\n\nTrade  compression:  A  process  that  involves  terminating \n\nexisting  trades  and  replacing  them  with  a  smaller  number  of \n\nnew \u201creplacement trades,\u201d which have the same risk profile and \n\ncash flows as the initial portfolio, but less capital exposure.\n\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation  |   2 9\n\n\fResearch Policy Brief 30\n\nUnregulated Entities, \nProducts, and Markets:\nChallenges for \nMonitoring and Regulation\n\nPeter Morgan\n\nAugust 2009\n\nAbout this Research Policy Brief\n\nThe  implications  for  financial  stability  of  lightly  regulated  and  highly \nleveraged  financial  institutions  such  as  hedge  funds  and  private  equity \nfunds,  together  with  innovative  financial  products  such  as  derivatives \nand asset-backed securities, remain a subject of controversy, especially \nin  the  current  global  financial  crisis,  where  issues  of  systemic  risk  have \nnot  only  national,  but  regional  and  global  implications.  This  policy  brief \nexamines  hedge  funds,  private  equity  funds,  and  innovative  financial \nproducts,  particularly  collateralized  debt  obligations  and  asset-backed \nsecurities, including their overall structure, their role in the development \nof the current global financial crisis, and what changes are needed in the \nglobal financial architecture related to these institutions and products to \nstrengthen financial stability going forward. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank Institute \n\nThe Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI), located in Tokyo, Japan, is \na  subsidiary  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).
